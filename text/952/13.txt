Felix 952 16 December 1 992
open to predatory bids in the short-
term, and will not be properly
saleable for about a year. This
effectively scuppers prospective
bids made by Conrad Black and M
J Heinz who had expressed
aquisitive interest in M G N shortly
after Robert Maxwell's death.
Notably absent from the
speculators at this time was News
International. Rupert Murdoch had
spent a year between December
1990 and 1991 clawing his way
back from the brink of bankruptcy,
facing debts of up to $8.1 billion.
The threat of any of up to 146
different creditors foreclosing on
his loans and forcing him to pay up
threatened the absolute collapse and
subsequent liquidation of his News
International Empire.
When Robert Maxwell's death
was announced in November 1991
Murdoch had just secured the safety
of his lines of credit, raised the $1.5
billion necessary to prevent a full
scale buy-out and had successfully
merged his massively loss making
Sky satellite transmission network
with its rival British Satellite
Broadcasting, and was using the
profits from his newspaper sales to
offset BSkyB's losses, and
beginning to show an overall profit.
However, a series of terrifying
climb-back's from over the edge
had left News Corps in a still
delicate state, not ready to consider
further aquisition.
By 1993, however, this state of
affairs might certainly have
changed. Were News, say, to
consider buying M G N in a year's
time, they would be elegantly
poised to do so, convenienced
further by substantive 'interior
decorating' carried out courtesy of
Messrs Montgomery, Banks,
Alwood et al.
It is disturbingly characteristic of
News International to force
executive and editorial
appointments which are directly
contrary to the papers tone and
style, and the choice of the staff
themselves. It has been a feature of
each of the editorships of Murdoch
flagship papers The Sun, The Times
and The Sunday Times. When in
1986 Murdoch moved the printing
presses out to his newly constructed
walled-in, barbed wired, union-
proof fortress Wapping', journalists
were given the ultimatium 'cross the
picket line or be fired'. Those who
did not comply were shown no
mercy, and others left of their own
accord because they could not
tolerate such shabby treatment.
From the Sunday Times alone,
nearly a third of its journalists left,
were fired, or resigned.
It is not wholly implausible to
suggest that perhaps M G N is being
sculpted specifically for a
Murdoch/Montgomery aquisition,
perhaps sometime in the next year,
and it would be hard to question that
there would have to be a pre-
arrangement with the banks on this
account, and that that would be the
most reasonable explanation for
their appointing Montgomery in the
face of such strenuous opposition.
If this is indeed the case, then where
does it leave the identity of the
Mirror"? If Rupert Murdoch
becomes an owner of M G N will the
newspapers be able to remain
unchanged?
Even before it is a political organ,
a newspaper is a commercial one,
and The MGN's papers are no
exception. The Daily Mirror and
the Sun are the two fiercest
competitors in the tabloid
circulation wars, and differ mainly
in their opposite political ideologies.
The people who buy the Mirror do
so because they seek a Labour party
supporter, and a paper with a left-
wing bias. No executive whatever
its own philosophy would risk
changing a paper so much that it lost
its customer appeal. It's unlikely
that M G N newspapers would cease
to be vocal supporters of the Labour
Party through the next election.
What may be a result though is that
because the executive has pruned
away, not just the editorship, but
other leader writers too, they won't
encourage new writers to be as
incisive as their predecessors were,
that in becoming more commercial
and saleable they will become
lightweight.
MGN's unique character lies in
the fact that they have consistently
set a different political agenda from
that of a range of Tory tabloids.
Mixed up with the Soap & Royals
stories, they have been responsible
for aggressive investigative stories,
unpopular with the government of
the time, notably pursuing the cases
of the Guildford Four and the
Birmingham Six at a time when
they were not picked up by other
papers. It is just this kind of story
that might find itself a casualty of
a new management, whose token
support of the Mirror's traditional
stance sadly fails to look beyond the
ledger and who's own political
agenda is quite different.
It is too early to say exactly who
will come to own Mirror Group
Newspapers, but the line of
dominoes has been arranged to
temptingly to lead to Murdoch and
Montgomery, that is the time ever
comes, all it will take is one little
push.
