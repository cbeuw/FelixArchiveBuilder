Editorial
Replies to letters
This week, Rick Bilby (ICU
Deputy President) writes a letter
containing aggressive attacks on CA
France, in a letter he has had
published this week. A peculiar
event, which I feel requires some
explanation on my part.
Last week, Rick came down to
Felix saying that he wished to write
a letter and would I mind if it was
a bit late? In the ensuing discussion,
I told Rick that another letter by C A
France had been submitted on the
subject of fire alarms. Obviously
Rick was interested, and I let him
see the letter. In retrospect, this was
more than a little unusual and I
regret doing it. Rick wrote his
abrasive letter as a response to what
C A France had to say.
Here is a tiny note of editorial
policy. From now on, if a letter is
submitted for an issue of Felix, no
one but Felix staff'will see it until
the copy is printed and distributed.
I apologise for this single lapse of
fair play on my part and it will not
happen again. Rick or anyone else
in this Union does not have the right
to preview or try and belittle the
opinion of those who have the
courage to stand up to him. With an
ICU president whose ways of
dealing with criticism are, at best,
doubtful, but at least more subtle
than his predecessor, we need
students who voice their objections
to the way they are treated. After
a slight hiccup, Felix will continue
to be the best forum for the
expression of all opinions at
Imperial.
Statement of Intent
The most grief I get is caused by
students who want to see their own
articles printed and are upset
because their piece didn't get in.
Indulge me please with a little word
of explanation. Letters, Clubs and
Societies articles, Small Ads,
What's on pieces and Sports
Felix 952
reports, to gain a chance of being
printed should be in at 1pm the
Monday before Felix's Friday
publication. Features and Adverts
should be submitted the Friday
before publication. Submitting by
these deadlines does not guarantee
you will get into Felix but
submitting after, guarantees you
won't. Thank you for listening;
have a nice day.
Choc-o-holics

More importantly, do you eat
chocolate in secret? Do you eat
more than 12 bars of chocolate a
week? If you can answer 'yes' to the
above questions, it is very likely
that the answers are connected. If
you are worried, you are not alone.
Some people eat 70 bars of
chocolate a week according to a
survey published yesterday. Those

Union Building, should take care,

Christmas
May I take this chance to wish
everyone who reads this far a very
pleasant Christmas, and give special
thanks to everyone who has helped
produce Felix this year. A lot of"
students put a lot of time and effort
into your magazine. If you want to
get involved, we will be open most
of the vacation and as soon as
college returns; so come along and
help out. Felix will return for your
entertainment on lanuary 15th next
year. Please try and survive without
us; I know it will be hard, but try.

Dear Jonty,
As part of our regular weekly sale
of 'Socialist Worker' the members
of IC Socialist Worker Student
Society (ICSWSS) held an ad-hoc
referendum in the ICR, the purpose
of which was to stimulate debate
and interest in the question posed.
The voters were given the free
choice between two responses: T
support the abolition of the
monarchy and the founding of a
republic' or 'I support the
continuation of the monarchy'.
It is, of course, impossible to
draw any firm conclusions from
such a quickly arranged and light-
hearted vote, in fact, the number of
votes cast was also too small to
permit any concrete analysis; (and
before you say 'oh yeah, they're
only saying that because everybody
showed their support for the
Queen'; in fact the small number of
votes cast were overwhelmingly in
favour of abolition) however, from
the many interesting conversations
we had in the ICR, it was obvious
to us that the abolition issue is at last
a reality.
One would say that the response
was only due to the renewed
topicality of the Royal Family. That
is true enough. However, it is
encouraging from our point of view
to see the question of abolition
being seriously discussed on
breakfast television and even more
encouraging to see that the Queen
will at last pay tax on her vast
fortune (given to her by the
m i s s u s
taxpayers of this country), even
though I doubt it will be backdated.
It is also a breath of fresh air to
see the people finally getting fed up
with the constant bailing out of the
monarchy. Finally the lunacy of the
system was made apparent: Sixty
million pounds for an old lady with
no fire insurance from a
government (who get their revenue
off the working people of this
country) who tell us there is nc
money for schools, hospitals, new
job creation or unemployment
benefit.
For the price of damage to the
house of a grandmother with five or
six 'little houses' think what we
could do for the hundreds of
thousands with no roof at all over
their heads, Windsor is a great
building, the Queen might be a nice
person (I wouldn't know as I've
never met her). It's nothing
personal.
I wonder if the Union would
consider a proper referendum on
the monarchy, just for interest's
sake—we'd be more than willing to
co-operate, as I'm sure would the
IC ConSoc who would just love to
see us filthy Bolsheviks stuffed.
Most of all, let's debate. We're
all rational human beings. Tell me
how we should spend the £60M the
Queen will get for Windsor. Maybe
we could put it towards paying the
£1 billion it will cost to close the
coal mines...
Yours sincerely,
Matthew Salter, ICSWSS

Dear Jonty,
The Hellenic Society would like
to protest against the provocation of
the Turkish Society during the
Overseas Week. The Turkish maps
showing the Greek islands of
Rhodes and the Dodecanese as well
as the occupied part of the
independent Republic of Cyprus
without indication that they were
part of independent countries were
sure to provoke the anger and
bitterness of Greeks and Greek-
Cypriots alike. The Turkish society
not only destroyed the spirit of the
event—which was the exhibition of
culture, civilisation and life of the
countries concerned—but also
deliberately insulted us and
provoked trouble by refusing to take
down the offensive material, when
ordered to do so by Union officials.
The Turkish Society knew what our
reaction would be and therefore is
the sole responsible for the
disruption of the event.
Dear Sir,
With reference to Imperial
College Radio. I am, without doubt,
mystified as to the reason why my
reception of this service in my
residence is so poor. I am a resident
in Weeks Hall, which is the North
side of Prince's Gardens. My
receiving apparatus is of a quality
which can pick up most
transmissions.
I am of the knowledge that these
types of broadcasting units have
usually a restricted range, but surely
This act is part of the generalised
Turkish propaganda which has
triple aim: firstly, to justify the
attrocities committed 18 years ago
in Cyprus; secondly, to perpetuate
the occupation and division of the
island of Cyprus, which is
condemned by the United Nations,
the Council of Europe and the
British and Commonwealth
governments; thirdly, to promote
territorial claims against Greece,
which could lead to war. It is
unacceptable to us that Imperial
College which has such a large
Greek community should be the
stage for this kind of propaganda.
We therefore demand an apology
from the Turkish Society in writing
and we really hope that these
provocations will stop taking place
in our College.
The Hellenic Society,
The Vice President
Christas Dallis.
Weeks Hall should be within this
range.
Therefore I would like to enquire
to other readers, whether their
service is affected in a similar way
and if so I would like to raise the
question, is a service that has such
a limited broadcast ability able to
perform the task of reaching its
target audience—students of
Imperial College?
Yours sincerely,
Matthew Daniel Solomon, EEL
