Theatre
King Lear
I lead my unassuming lamb to lose
his maidenhead to Shakespeare.
'And how was it for you?' is the
question begged. Enter into a
world. The hurdles of language, the
foreignness of style, the lurch into
unknown corridors of plot:
conquered with might, majesty and
tenderness. It made a difference;
opened a space.
Why say this? Why is this
important? Because I wasn't sure
who Shakespeare was anymore.
Compass Theatre Company are
sure. The cast, the directory, the
designer—they know. And so, now,
does one more mortal.
And how was it for me? P. P. P.
Powerful and clever and direct and
strong. Oh, and such a relief for it
to be so good. Quite took me aback.
King Lear. Appear. Be here for
all.
Darwen.

Concert
The Imperial Symphony Orchestra
performed last Friday to a packed
Great Hall.
They warmed up with Elgar's 'In
the South' a wonderfully extrovert
and youthful piece. It is deceptively
difficult to play with soaring
melodies often supported by filigree
passage work, particularly from the
violins, who therefore set the pace
of the whole piece. The music, void
of a deeper meaning is boisterously
happy roaming around in a rich and
predimonantly beautiful and sunny
countryside. The mood shifts a
great deal, the listener is never
bored, gladly contemplating new
vistas as they unfold, sometimes
darkened by clouds and some local
minor drama. The ruling
impression is joyful and sunny.
Elgar's Cello Concerto in E
minor followed that extrovert happy
romp in Southern Italy. By their
sharp contrast the two works
demonstrate the breadth and
richness of Elgar's creative spirit.
The Cello Concerto is a sensitive
exploration of an inner landscape,
devoid of joy; 'poor in spirit',
restricted as it is to complex and
tragic feelings. An inner landscape
King Lear
mirroring maybe the devastation of
Europe's war zones, that must have
been so painful to contemplate for
Elgar the traveller, who wrote this
music at the end of the Great War.
Maybe also an elegy for a lost
friend? Elgar's ability to identify
with the sad soul the cello depicts,
was so deep that he even could
make the occasional cheerful
prompting passages from the
outside world, (which the orchestra
appears to represent) sound as
meaningless as they would
inevitably appear to a withdrawn
and broken mind.
The soloist, Lowri Blake was
temperamentally well equipped to
enter into this deeply sensitive and
searching mood for Elgar. She had
prviously studied with Jacqueline du
Pre—but rejected her reading of
Elgar—finding it more vigorous
than Elgar had intended. Her
interpretation was not only credible
but, one felt, the result of a patient
and receptive meditation on what
Elgar meant to say. She is a
technically impressive performer
demanding intense concentration
from the listener. The timbre and
richness of her tone was sadly
muted by the Great Hall's
unresponsive acoustics. The
vigorous playing from a substantial
body of strings in the orchestra was
right though similarly dampened.
This was a pity but did not
overshadow the fact that the
orchestra had once again invited a
winning soloist to play with them.
It must be merely a matter of time
before she becomes a household
name. Anyone unable to get a seat
last Friday should seek out the
opportunity to hear her play this
concerto in the early spring of 93
at the Royal Festival Hall.
Those who took pot-luck and
bought her C D 'Scotch and Soda',
which was on sale in the
intermission, had a nice surprise in
store. In this recording she sings
light music and accompanies herself
on the cello. A harp and double bass
also feature as backdrop to her very
clear and good voice. May we see
her invited back to Imperial to
perform in this format and style
too?
Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet
Suites—were well-chosen for an
orchestra possessing verve and
enthusiasm in abundance and very
considerable skills under the
leadership of a youthful and
energetic conductor.
The ballet suites nicely reflect the
Russian attitude to life—alternating
between loud and chaotic sections,
as passionate and undisciplined as
Russia in anarchy, and the tic/toe
discipline of a military parade on
the Red Square. The rhythmic
sections in fact demand such
metronomic playing that the ICSO
conductor, who at all times helps
his orchestra along by bodily
miming the music, appeared at
times almost to be animated by
clockwork.
Contemplating this great seesaw
of two attitudes to life and society,
one might perceive Prokofiev and
Richard Dickins as being in cahoots
in an endeavour to make the
orchestra excell: pushing them
regularly into recklessly indulgent
lyricism—only to haul them back to
the most rigorous time-keeping
drillwork. It was as if the orchestra
was weighed up and tested. The
result of the test may be surprising
as one usually expets amateur
players to perform most
successfully in the slower more
lyrical passages, whilst here, in
Romeo and Juliet, ICSO
demonstrated a youthful vigour and
strength in the rhythmic sections
that was thrilling in the extreme.
All-in-all the concert was a huge
success and a great credit to the
soloist, the conductor and the
orchestra. An extra tribute is
merited by the solo wind players.
The audience showed their
appreciation by prolonged
thunderous applause.
