A n - N U S Horribilis
Declan Curry takes a look at the NUS students' charter and sees an
organisation fighting for it's life
If it has achieved nothing else, the
Government's fetish for voluntary
membership has caused the
National Union of Students (NUS)
to take a hard, introverted look at
itself. Last week saw the NUS
picking up its entrails, reheating
them in a pot, and serving them as
the potage de jour. In an eventful
Wednesday, the organisation
launched its much leaked students'
charter. Of more significance, it
also held the first meeting of its
newly formed National Council, the
very body set up to circumvent the
loony excesses of the Winter
Conference. One in the eye for the
Trots, that.
The Students' Charter was bound
to receive most publicity, not least
because it was leaked to the Times
the week before. Well, the Times
calls it a leak. The NUS say that it
was 'strategically placed' with a
sympathetic journalist and an
influential newspaper. Well, at least
they got it half right.
Half right was also an overheard,
if underhand, description of the
charter when it was launched at
T U C House. Hmmm. The NUS
spends three years convincing us
that they are not a trades union, and
then launch one of their most
important documents at the
headquarters of the Trades Union
Congress. 'Holloway Road (the site
of the NUS headquarters building)
isn't big enough,' said a
spokeswoman. 'We're expecting
over 100 people for the launch'. In
the end, no more than 25 people
were in the room. Pass that shotgun
a bit closer to your foot, there.
For an educational document, no
one with a distinct educational
background was invited. William
Waldergrave, Minister for the
Citizen's Charter and Whitehall's
paperclip convenor, got an
invitation for the launch and used
it to test his shredder. The three
politicians who did turn up were
Mark Fisher, Labour's junior
Citizen's Charter spokesman, and
Matthew Taylor, Citizen's Charter
spokesman for the Liberal
Democrats, so fairly junior as well.
The third politician was Dermot
Keohe, the NUS Vice President for
The old NUS, sit ins, marches and
Education. As I said, no educational
background.
The NUS Students' Charter had
10 'rights'; the right to access, the
right to flexibility, the right to
finance for study, the right to
accommodation, the right to learner
agreements, the right to extra-
curricular facilities, the right to
good teaching, the right to
representation, the right to
complaint and appeal, and the right
to reward.
These rights were to be enshrined
by the key recommendations,
detailed in the box. Dermot Keohe
said that the recommendations were
student centred, with 'quality and
choice as a priority'. It was, no
doubt, a desire for choice which led
to the NUS to 'come out' in favour
of semesterisation.
Under semesterisation, the
academic year has two 'teaching
units' or terms. Each term is of
fifteen weeks, and is known as a
semester. Semesterisation is being
examined by almost every
university in the country, and some
have already proposed
semesterisation of one type or
over paid sabbaticals.
another. King's College London
and University College London
have started to implement three
terms, the first two being 12 weeks
long, with a third term of only six
weeks. This allows for a longer
revision period, and shortens the
usually ineffective summer term.
The University of Stirling and
Liverpool John Moores University
have two 15 week semesters, with
each semester lying either side of
Christmas. The first semester starts
in early September, and, after a five
or six week holiday, the second
semester begins in early February,
ending in mid May. The
Universities involved say that their
scheme allows a summer study
scheme to be developed. The
Northern Universities Interim
Programme proposes two twelve
week teaching semesters, each
being followed by a three week
assessment period. This allows the
first semester to straddle the
Christmas break, as the first
assessment period takes place after
the holiday.
One of the criticisms of
semesterisation is that it could lead
to 'fast track' degrees, that is
students finishing their courses in
two years. This innovation would,
of course, rock the academic world
to its very foundations, and would
end educational civilisation as it has
been known for over 40 years. Yet
the unthinkable has happened in that
bastion of free enterprise, the
(private) University of
Buckingham, prop. M Thatcher,
Baroness. In a career move from
First Lord of the Treasury to
Chancellor of the University, the
good lady has the dubious pleasure
of presiding over a three semester
year, that is September to January,
February to May, and May to
August. Be warned. Our own
educational bastion, Imperial
College pic, is looking at a possible
introduction of semesterisation.
Given that the great Cashier, Sir
Eric Ash, once said that courses
should start at eight in the morning,
it is not beyond the bounds of
reason that we could see something
similar. Unless you believe the
Union president, Chris Davidson.

Union Council, the kilted one wrote
