Mo'Money
This is described as an action-
comedy-romance. I normally like
them. They are usually rather crap
in an 'artistic' sort of way. Nothing
really changes does it.
Its about black people and
money. That covers the action part
covered. For the comedy the
brothers involved make everybody
around them look like fools. All
except for the female interest, who
escapes without suffering their one-
liners. That's romance.
Damon Wayans (Johny Stewart)
stars. He comes top of the cast list
anyway. Nobody really starts, it's
a communal effort. Even the
inclusion of his brother Marlon (as
Johnny's brother, Seymour) fails to
inject any spirit into this film.
Everything can be described as
competent, but to me that is the
ultimate insult. If something fails to
leave any real impression, be it
good, be it dire what is the point of
watching it?

How do you make the traditional
pantomime a million times more
enjoyable? Easy, do what the Grace
theatre have done and pack it full
to the brim with topical humour, a
mountain of sexual innuendos and
a handful of entertaining songs.
This adults only version is
nothing less than a laugh a second
as the normal amount of
ridiculousness expected of a panto
is increased beyond side-splitting
proportions. The writer Gerry
Marsh deserves an award for
originality and the actors and
actresses were not only extremely
well cast but clearly enjoyed the
performance as much as the
audience did. There is an increase
in the amount of audience
participation to the extent that I
thought I was as at a Rocky Horror
show but this is by no means a put
off, if anything, lovers of the Rocky
Horror-type atmosphere will love
this panto.
If for certain reasons you only
intend to see one panto this year,
then you must make it this one.

Neville Southall's Washbag
Well luvvies, this charming
tragicomedy is just an absolutely
fabulous story of a man's
methodical self-destruction and the
effect it has on the sweethearts and
darlings in his life. For those
sweeties among you who know
bugger all about football, Neville
Southall was the goalkeeper for the
losing side in the 1985 F . A . Cup.
The sweetheart script writer,
David Farr, deserves more than the
mass of applause that the cast
received, (the darling cast, by the
way, are adorable). Notable
performances are from Penelope,
played by Rachel Weisz, whose
expressionless face was one of the
high spots in the play, and Bill,
played by Pete Lee Wilson, who
was simply wonderful as he roller-
coasted from light- hearted humour
to really deep tragedy the next.
To sum up for those luvvies,
sweethearts, darlings and angels
among you who cannot be bothered
to read the whole review, this play
is a must for those who are able to
appreciate a super script executed
marvellously by the cast.

Hamlet
I'm probably one of the few people
who has never seen Hamlet before.
I suppose it's always useful to have
read it since—at least to my
inexperienced ears—Shakespearean
language is difficult to understand.
Anyway, I liked this performance
by the Compass Theatre Company,
directed by Neil Sissons. Hamlet
(Paul Rider) was brilliant and very
convincing, as well as the Ghost
(Michael Palmer). Polonius was
Neville Southall's Washbag
played by a real comedian, David
Westbrook. I was actually sad when
Hamlet murdered Polonius because
I had been enjoying him so much.
In the whole production, few
props were used; sometimes it was
rather pantomimic, especially the
excellent play in front of Queen and
King. The lighting was done very
well, using rectangular and
horizontal spots with interesting
effects, not only in the Ghost scenes
but also when Hamlet and Laertes
were fencing. But what I liked best
was the Grave-digger bit. The entire
cast was standing in the darkened
background, rapping together bits
of various songs and pieces—
absolutely brilliant. But even
without this it would certainly have
been worth seeing.
