Back-kick your slingjoy and off..?
W A R N I N G : Adults only this
Friday as the Union Building is
taken over by an orgy of aural
excitement and visual frenzy.
Yep... .the return of Dr Death Bang
and his posse of sexual misfits;
Death Bang Party. A firm favourite
with Imperial hedonists, their
palace of pleasure will be throbbing
into the early hours with a pop
pedigree unrivalled in these waters.
These pessaries of pop will be
facing a strong challenge to their
throne from the support band of the
night—Pussies Galore. Now, now
don't laugh they're a very serious
musical all-girl trio whose taste for
kinky clothing, whips and rousing
renditions of James Bond theme
tunes and songs like 'Biker Chicks'
should not impose on their serious
music credibility. They've played
at Kinky Gerlinky's Puscha and the
recent Skin Two ball. Miss them at
your peril.
There'll be the usual effervescent
ents disco to send you on your
merry way home to Xmas
celebrations. With a bar till 2am,
Smile Zone Happy Hour
(8.30pm-10pm: All drinks down
20%) and disco till 3am.
B E W A R N E D : This end of term
event is liable to sell out. In the
event of this happening, there will
be positively no entry without a
ticket. Da Vinci's and the traditional
bar will close at 7.30pm with the
whole Union Building being cleared
at this time. Entry will then be
restricted to the event. Tickets are
limited. Buy yours now to avoid
disappointment—£2.50 in advance,
£3 on the door. Get your kinky gear
out and make love.
Andy.
New Union Advice Office opens
What's in a name?
ICU's Welfare Office is changing
its name. From Monday 7th
December it will be known as the
Union Advice Office in order to
more accurately reflect the type of
work undertaken. ICU's Welfare
Adviser will be known as the Union
Adviser, again to convey the fact
that students seek advice from the
Office and that this advice is not
necessarily tied up with welfare
matters. Consultations with the
President of the Union and the
Union Manager have resulted in this
change being put forward and the
action has been welcomed by the
College's Student Welfare
Committee.
The Advice Office will maintin
the existing opening hours and
students are free to seek advice on
any matter. Stefano Ruis, the Union
Adviser, is a professional member
of ICU's staff. He has considerable
advice work experience gained
thorugh his work in Citizens Advice
Bureaux and within a Law Centre.
Students (and staff) can approach
him for advice on any matter of
concern from legal rights,
immigration problems and debt to
consumer matters, taxation and
landlord and tenant disputes. The
service remains confidential at all
times so no details about your
consultation will be divulged to any
third party without your express
permission.
Stefano can be consulted either by
phone or in person during his
advertised 'surgery' hours. No
appointment is necessary but special
arrangements can be made where
necessary - just telephone
beforehand in order to discuss your
needs.
New Legal Advice Surgeries
Following negotiations between the
Union Adviser and a local firm of
solicitors, the Union Advice Office
is pleased to announce the start of
a new Legal Advice Surgery
available to all students and staff.
From Monday 14th December
volunteer solicitors will be available
on a fortnightly basis to give free
legal advice during an evening
session. Consultations are by
appointment only and these must be
made through the Union Adviser.
Students should first seek advice
from the Union Adviser who may
then make an appointment for the
legal advice session where this
would be appropriate. The solicitors
can advise on a number of subjects
and, where necessary, at their
discretion, could undertake
negotiations on your behalf. The
service is only available through the
Union Advice Office so students
seeking legal advice should consult
Stefano Ruis (the Union Adviser) in
the first instance.
