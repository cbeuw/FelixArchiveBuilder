Advisor advised Garden's Blaze
by Declan Curry
Stefano Ruis, Imperial College
Union Adviser, is seeking legal
advice on payments to Imperial
College Day Nursery. A spokesman
for the Attorney General's office
told Felix that they had received a
letter from the Union asking for
permission to seek advice. This was
granted as a general request, and the
spokesman commended the 'good
practice of union officers writing in'
if there was a possible problem.
ICU funding to the Day Nursery,
in Prince's Gardens, was stopped
over two years ago. At that time,
sabbatical officers decided that
payments to the nursery did not give
a direct educational benefit to
students, and so were ultra vires
(out of rules, illegal). A legal
opinion sought by Felix in May this
year said that the payment provided
for a service of educational benefit,
and so was permissible. This
interpretation has been confirmed
for Felix by the Attorney General's
office. The spokesman said
yesterday that the Treasury Solicitor
was 'pretty relaxed about these
payments', as such donations 'were
related to the provision of services
for students as students'. He added
that day care facilities were
regarded as 'beneficial to studies'.
Library Petition
by Gareth Light
Asst News Ed
The first section of a petition calling
for longer Library opening hours
has been given to the Rector. The
10 page, 154 signature, document
calls for the hours of the Lyon
Playfair Library to be changed to
an opening time of 9am and a
closing time of 10pm. This is a 1
hour extension on the current
9.30am- 9.30pm opening time, with
5.30pm closing during vacation
time. The petition asks for the new
hours to apply on Sunday and
during vacations.
The petition has been organised
by Dr Conrad Lichtenstein, of the
Centre for Biotechnology. Dr
Lichtenstein tells the Rector that
other copies of the petition are in
circulation, but the current petition
is being sent so that a response can
be made before Christmas. The
document says that opinions were
'very strong in support of an
extension to the opening hours', and
that 'many people were
inconvenienced by the early closing
in the College vacations'. The
proposed new hours would cater for
research workers, postgraduates
and undergraduates working
through the holidays.
Dr Lichtenstein says that an
extension to the opening hours will
require an increase in salary costs,
and suggests that a significant
increase in costs could be avoided
by using security staff to man the
library during the extended hours.
Dr Lichtenstein adds that this means
the usual library support services
will not be available in the new
opening periods, but that staff and
students 'would be grateful just to
use the library even if unable to take
books out then'.
The scene out side Gardens Hall
News Staff
A 'chip pan fire' in Garden Hall
was extinguished by the London
Fire Brigade on Monday night. The
fire started in a third floor kitchen
in the Prince's Gardens' hall, when
the pan was left heating on the
cooker. The oil was being used for
an 18th birthday fondue party, and
the girl said that she left the pan
heating for about five or ten
minutes.
Fire alarms went off in the Hall
at 7.52pm, and security guards
from the Prince's Gardens'
Southside lodge were called. The
sub-warden put the fire out with a
carbon dioxide extinguisher, but it
re-ignited as the window was open.
Attempts to extinguish the fire a
second time failed, and the kitchen
filled with smoke. The sub warden
evacuated the kitchen, and closed
the door.
The hall had evacuated as all fire
on Monday
alarms were audible and the
(magnetically locked fire doors
opened. The fire brigade were
called by security at 8.00pm, and
they arrived at the scene at 8.04pm,
after which the fire was put out.
Speaking at the scene, Angus
Fraser, College Managing Director,
praised the fire service for their
. 'prompt intervention'.
The Gardens fire followed earlier
fires or fire alerts in Southwell Hall
and the Union Building, when fire
alarms were inaudible. Nicky Fox,
Imperial College Union Housing
Officer, said she was 'extremely
worried' by the failure of fire
alarms in Robert Pryor House. The
College is continuing with its rolling
upgrading of fire safety systems on
College grounds. Weeks Hall will
be first to be upgraded, followed by
Linstead and Southside. Houses in
Evelyn Gardens will be the last to
be upgraded.
