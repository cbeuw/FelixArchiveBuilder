'the likelihood is that nothing will
be the verdict and that if change is
recommended it will be rejected by
the Board of Studies, so don't
panic'.
It is surprising that, of all the
models available, the NUS has
plumped for that which offers all
year teaching. Not that they would
advocate such a development,
though: They have just pinched the
Buckingham idea, and modified it
so thM students have the choice of
which two of the three terms they
wish to study. Perhaps it was this
display of craft which moved the
Times to note 'the students' union
is at last coming up with good
ideas'.
Did they mean that financial
redress for students was also a good
idea? Admittedly this is one of the
mainstays of the Government's
contagious Charter bandwagon, and
it seems reasonable for the late
payment of grants. 'Students should
receive the equivalent of the interest
they could have received on the
value of the grant for every day that
the grant is late," they say. Or
indeed some compensation for the
interest charged while running up
enormous debts while waiting for
the damned thing. Some Imperial
students were still waiting for this
term's grant when I spoke to them
last week.
But how far does this
compensation lark go? On IC
Radio, Dermot Keohe said that
students should receive
compensation for 'inadequate'
accommodation. Whilst we all
know that Holloway Road is not a
nice area to slum in, Mr Keohe had
some difficulty in deciding what
inadequate accommodation was.
Eventually he came up with an
ingenious definition. 'Not Butlins'.
If you were looking for an
honorary degree in rugby or
minibus driving, then the call for
'credits for student union or
community work' was just for you.
If you wanted a degree of any
description, you were unlikely to be
cheered by the insistence on 'all
teachers in further and higher
education to possess a teaching
qualification'. If you wanted, you
could make up your own degree,
with an individually tailored
'learner agreement'. 'Students are
often uncertain of the relevance of
specific courses to their needs,'
reads the document. This is
especially true after graduation, or
at any stage in the Department of
Computing. 'We need to begin with
an analysis of a student's needs, not
what teachers want to teach.
Students should be able to negotiate
their own interim targets for
achievements, concentrating on a
students' needs and progress'. What
if your options are changed mid-
course, like in Biology at the end
of last year? The document calls for
students to have the right to redress
should the institution fail to deliver
their side of the learner agreement.
'This should make institutions think
twice,' it adds as an interesting
aside.
A l l this causes some
wonderment. Why the fuss? The
Government is due to publish its
own further and higher education
charter, though not now until the
New Year. The 'Citizen's Charter
First Report', recently published,
proudly boasts that this piece of
paper will give students, employers
and the wider community 'the right
to information about what is on
offer and about its quality. The
Charters may cover such matters as
quality assessment of courses,
membership of student unions and
the setting of standards for services
such as the timely and correct
payment of grants and loans.'
Something borrowed, something
blue.
The N U S says that earlier
charters have not involved the client
group. 'The Parent's Charter was
not written by parents, nor was the
Patient's Charter written by
patients. Students want a say in any
students' charter'. Any other
reasons? Why not take a look at
what Lorna Fitzsimons, N U S
President, said to the NUS National
Council on the same day as the
charter launch. 'Aside from the
threat to student unions represented
by current Government proposals,
NUS also suffers from more deep
seated problems. Students, student
unions and the wider public all have
difficulty in understanding the
NUS. A perception exists that NUS
is poor at providing information on
services.' Ah. Merry Christmas,
NUS. Rest in Peace.
NUS, strangely out of place in education's new world order
