Dear Felix,
As an active sports person within
the College, I always read with
particular interest the sports page in
Felix. However, I find myself
becoming increasingly frustrated by
the stupid slogans inserted between
people's first and surnames when
mentioned in articles. So come on
all your sports scribes out there;
stop being wankers and stick to the
facts.
Yours,
Dave (becoming increasingly
frustrated by the stupid slogans
inserted between people *s first and
surnames) Buckle.
Dear Jonty,
I'm quite sure that your editorial
on 'Religion' will receive several
replies—some may even bear out
what you wrote by losing their
temper!
Even recent history shows that
the damage caused by misguided
religion can be significant. Less
obvious, perhaps, are some of the
positive roles that the traditional
churches fulfil. Leaving aside the
question of whether belief is
unfounded, the counselling,
community and charitable activities
of religious institutions are
worthwhile in their own right.
Particularly in difficult economic
times, many people find themselves
isolated, depressed and desperate.
Any religious minister will tell you
that much of his (or her) time is
spent supporting and advising these
people. The luxury of faith, which
many here at Imperial find difficult
to accept, affords at least some hope
in a world that may seem very
unwelcoming.
The disadvantages stem from the
transition from religious fervour, or
any form of extremism, to violence.
It seems unreasonable to lay this
solely at the door of any Church.
In most cases the label of religion
is added to an essentially cultural or
historic disturbance.
I doubt very much that the IRA
are fighting for the benefit of
Roman Catholicism. If they were
they might listen to Pope John Paul
II and cease their pointless terrorist
campaign.
Perhaps our conclusion should be
to remind religious societies and
institutions that they should pay
more attention to their own
consciences and creeds. It is
difficult to understand any religious
body that achieves its aims by
harming or offending others.
Yours sincerely,
Geoff Maxwell, Elec Eng 2,
Vice President, CathSoc.
Isn't h e a little o l d f o r all t h i s ?
Dear Jonty,
It is with a twinge of regret that
I feel the need to write to you
regarding the 'Beit Back' column,
Felix issue 951. Initially I would
like to say that this correspondence
is not something designed to ring
fence my ego, but more an
interpretation of facts and how it
may be possible to move forward
into the future with a positive
perspective rather than a negative
one.
Quoting 'Beit Back' you say
' . . . Y e Olde Johnny Griffiths
(32)'—in fact I am 31, Date of Birth
20 May 1962.
Moving on from such pedantics,
Mr Back states '...what Jonathan
did last year—as far as security
goes, absolutely nothing'. Then,
halfway through the last paragraph,
and I quote again 'A year ago there
was a vast change in Union
Security', (something which, as
Deputy President, was one of my
many areas of responsibility).
'When card checking was
introduced, and the then Duty
Officers, started working in
groups...'
Surely a blatant contradiction? I
did absolutely nothing last year
regarding security, as well as
implementing a vast change! Okay,
self esteem dealt with, let us now
look at security itself. The only
reason we need security staff is
because a certain area is insecure.
We have fire alarms installed in the
Union Building to inform its
occupants to get out a.s.a.p.
because of a fire, but it can also be
used to deter the mugger, rapist, etc
from carrying out their evil deeds.
From my experience last year as
Deputy President, went off on a few
occasions, but for only two reasons.
Firstly, as a test ot make sure all the
circuits, and evacuation procedures
were in order, and secondly because
of wanton vandalism.
Because of the Union Card
checks now in place, and one year
old, this means that only members
of Imperial College Union, their
bone-fide quests, and members of
other student unions who have
reciprocal membership with ICU
are users of the Union Building on
Wednesday and Friday nights. In
essence, it turns out that the vast
majority of users of Wednesdays
and Fridays are undergraduates at
IC. So when we have a false alarm
of the nature witnessed in the early
hours of Saturday 28th November,
it is relatively safe to assume that
A. N . Other from Department X
(immaturely) attempted to empty
the Union Building, spoiling a
perfectly good night for the other
stressed out students who just
wanted to relax and have a bit of
fun.
The moral of the story? Criticise
the sabbatical in charge of security?
Yes, but criticise constructively and
find out why, ror instance, the
alarm's couldn't be heard, or why
the maglocks did not open. Armed
with the answers to these questions
it is then time to analyse the
infrastructure of, how it could be,
and why the Union Building has not
been altered. After all, the Students'
Union only receives a small
subvention from College every year
and then ICU has to make choices
on how to spend this money. And
don't forget, Y O U the students
direct the Union on how to spend
its subvention by the various student
committees. The sabbaticals cannot
just decide on, say, Friday to invest
£10,000 (or £10 for that matter) and
then start spending on the following
Monday. The Union has to find this
money from somewhere within its
limited budget, and only if you, the
students, approve. Would you like
your society's budget halved, or do
without the £8000 to help purchase
the Print Unit's collator? In all
honesty, I think not. You must also
remember that ultimately Imperial
College are the controllers of the
Union Building and any change
within must be authorised,
investigated and sometimes over-
managed by them. So, you may
bad-mouth Rick Bilby but he can
only operate as efficiently as the
resources available to him allow.
With this in mind, I suggest you
read 'The Official Version', page
5 of Issue 951 and I think a
constructive conclusion is that Rick
is doing the best he can given the
resources available to him. He has
organised a new power supply at no
monetary cost to you the student.
Finally, think about the term
'Resources Available'. Resources
are not just cash balances, bricks
and mortar etc, but they also include
the students of ICU. Just as cash
balances can be classified as
A l o n e v o i c e
Dear Sir,
As I anticipated in my letter of
28th November, the college
management have mostly ingored
the potentially fatal matter of
inadequate fire alarms and locked
fire doors at the Union on Friday
27th November.
The only attempt to acknowledge
this, came from the Union Deputy
President (Felix 4th December).
What a pathetic article that was! He
writes that the evacuation took
longer than was hoped; fifteen
minutes! One quarter of one hour!
In less than one third of that time,
fire can engulf a room, such as Da
Vinci's for example.
He writes that alarm bells are not
audible in some parts of the
building; should that not have read,
positive or negative, the student (?)
who set off the alarm is without
doubt a negative resource to the
Union and in turn a negative asset
to his/her fellow students who were
adversely affected by the culprit's
aforementioned immature acts.
Does Rick, your elected
representative deserve what he got?
No, certainly not. In fact, all the
criticism should have been directed
at the person who set off the alarm.
This type of individual is spoiling,
and will continue to spoil an
environment especially designed for
students to enjoy themselves. So
next time why not denote your copy
in a way which is intended to punish
the instigator of such crimes, while
you constructively criticise the
sabbaticals, and the manner in
which they allocate the scarce
resources available to them.
Merry Christmas,

'...in any busy, well populated
area...'? He also says that he has
been assured of improvements as
soon as possible; N O T G O O D
E N O U G H ! ! When?
However, the crowning stupidity
in this article is when he writes that
the fire exits are only kept locked
shut when the building is in use.
PARDON?
The aforementioned article shows
just how negligent is the attitude of
management when it comes to fire
safety. I just hope that I am one of
the lucky ones who escapes a fatal
incident and is able to testify to the
'Criminal Negligence' of College
and Union Management.
Yours faithfully,
