Rag Raid
If you want to go, come to a Friday
R A G meeting (1.10pm in the Ents
Lounge) and sign up. There are
only two catches. Firstly, you will
be cruelly forced to grab a
collecting can and raise some
money for charity inside the
ground. Secondly, as the response
for the F A cup Final places has
been so large already, if you want
a place you'll have to have done at
least one ox two other collections
before hand.
So, if you're football crazy, pop up
and see us some time.
The third Rag Raid of term
happened on Saturday the 5th. 13
Raggies set off to Aylesbury to
collect for Barnados. Why
Aylesbury? Well there weren't any
licences to collect in any of the
closer university towns, so we
picked somewhere that wasn't too
far, had a market, and a burning
need for collectors.
The weather was a little cold, but
the Christmas shoppers with all
their spare cash were out in force,
so we managed to raise a cool £860.
The top collector was Francesca
Fiorentino with £160; not bad for
a rookie.
On the way home we took a slight
detour to the pub followed by
singing all the usual sing-a-longs in
the minibus.
Anyway, thanks to Tim Atkinson
for driving and everyone else for
coming along.
You too?
Would you trust these people with
I've Tiddled, played Monopoly,
Climbed a pavement and Bungee
Jumped. I've had Free Fun
Fantastic days out at Maidstone,
Aylesbury and Guildford winning
a Barrel of Beer with my Hall
Chums and guess what? I've still
come back for more. Perhaps it's
because I also got to see QPR v
Leeds for F R E E , The London
Crusaders for F R E E and above all
your money?
The C U R E LIVE for F R E E ! ! . Are
you impressed? You should be! Are
you jealous? You should be! But
you too can be Part of it by coming
to weekly R A G meetings and
joining the leaders of the crowd and
getting involved with the mayhem.
Oh yes, by the way I've also raised
over £1000 for charities letting our
fun antics have a benificial side for
others.
