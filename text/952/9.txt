Praise fit for a Queen?
What do Imperial College Students think about the recently releasedprayer
book for gays and lesbians? David Spooner and Tanya Nizam canvass
our views.
A few months ago, a prayer book
for same-sex couples entitled
'Daring to speak Love's Name'
acquired for itself some notoriety
with its publishing. To say that the
church is divided over this issue
would perhaps overstate its
schismatic properties, as it became
rather overshadowed by the
ordination of women priests, but
dischord at least, is evident. The
Archbishop of Canterbury recently
declared, in effect, his personal
enmity to the book which formally
brings God into the Gay
community. Opposition from within
the church has declared its
unreserved support for a publication
so necessary as a declaration of the
universal love of God for his or her
own sex.
With the blessing (sic) of the
Bishop of Durham, amongst other
notable clergymen and women, the
book has aroused considerable
media interest. Felix sent its most
sympathetic and sensitive reporter
to uncover the reason behind the
outrage and, indeed, to discover if
there is outrage behind the reason.
There is, among its supporters,
a definite opinion that before the
Prayer-book was published, the gay
community was effectively
restrained from ceremony because
the church would not accept that the
Bible could apply to them, thus
denying them, by implication, the
right to participate in the belief of
a christian god. There are also
accusations from the opposite side,
of secularism, of 'protesting too
much', of promoting their special
status as if distinct from society; the
list of accusation and counter-
accusation is endless. It is no longer
relevant to ask how the church will
deal with this issue, as we have
history to tell us of schism, pope
and antipope, Torquemada, Jesus
Christ, and so on. Orthodox meets
Radical, vice versa, and gods get
confused. The book, the love, the
honesty and a silly pseudo-religious
word like enlightenment. These are
the issues.
The book contains chapters
concerning a celebration of Coming
Out, Partings, and the Death of
Friends; most consist of Psalms,
Passages, and Verse written by the
author and other gay christians. I
found literally several people
willing to talk about the issues; Tina
thought the book was necessary,
and was a needed affirmation of
spiritual identity to those at whom
the book is aimed, although John
disputed that it would have any real
effect on the church's approach to
its gay followers. Andy responded
in a similar fashion, with the
comment that gay ceremony is
recognized by neither the law or the
General Synod, and Gareth thought
there was no specific need for the
book, as relevant passages could be
found already in the Bible, and that
there were a number of cases of
sympathetic priests performing
ceremonies for gay couples. Both
Rachel and David focused on the
need to bring attention to the public,
as the church refused to
acknowledge homosexual and
lesbian relationships between
practicing Christians. I might yet
remark that the church may find
'the Love that dare not speak its
name' gaining its voice, and
gathering its courage. When asked
later of Doctor David Jenkins'
reference to 'Homophiles', and his
comments in the foreword
regarding sexuality in a genital-
specific sense, John said that a
limited word such as 'homosexual'
could be responsible for much
negativity. 'Homophile', with its
reference to emotional love, is a
positive name; however, John
disagreed that gays had been denied
love and emotion as part of their
necessary vocabulary. Nearly
everyone asked concurred
regarding the limitations and
negativism of the word
'homosexual', and the need for new
terminology.
Although responses to
questioning were generally of a
positive nature, John asserted that
public familiarity with the book
would reinforce and polarise
opinion, creating violent antipathies
and equally violent sympathies. All
agreed that their opinions would
probably not change, but become
more extreme in nature.
I am a non-christian, non-gay
sympathiser; I found this book
moving, intense and passionate.
This is by Rebecca Lewin, from
'Partings'.
'.. .I'm not ready to have lost her,
and I can't say to the world,
Help me, I am divorced, I am
divorced!
They would not even believe we
had ever been married.'
