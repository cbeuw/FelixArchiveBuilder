Money, Money, Money...
The Finance Society is a relatively
new and growing society at
Imperial College and exists for
those of you who want to increase
your grasp of the key concepts,
issues and terminology used in the
world of finance, business and
investment.
The Society's main objective is to
find as many stimulating ways of
doing this as possible. Since the
launch of the Society we have gone
from 0 to 370 members in a mere
two years. Even if this does appear
to overheat our fledgling clerical
apparatus and create the odd spot of
chaos at times, we have still
managed to become arguably the
largest and fastest growing society
at IC. We want the society to be
alive and evolving and so we would
like plenty of feedback from
members about possible events.
During the course of this term we
have maintained an average of just
over one event per week held on
various topics ranging from
accountancy to merchant banking
and we do boast an average
attendance of ninety people per
event.
Despite our achievements we are
not sitting on our laurels, as we feel
there are a great many budding
financial genii who have not joined
our society, so get moving, now!
We're not here to preach and
convert you from engineers and
scientists to grossly overpaid
financial wizards, our objective is
simple, it is to educate you, the
student community of IC, about the
world of finance.
Earlier I mentioned the large
variety of events we have held this
term, you may ask 'What events?'.
Well those of you who are members
would have regularly received the
Society newsletter which listed the
events of the next few weeks in
advance. Anyway, coming back to
the point, the events kicked off with
the free cheese and wine party
which was attended by over 150
people (bunch of boozers!) as well
as the very successful presentation
by Andersen Consulting on
Management Consultancy, it too
was widely attended and let me say
that the free buffet (at a cost of £ 6
a head) had, absolutely nothing to do
with it. The most interesting event
of the term was (especially for you
job seekers) the Inverview Skills
Workshop by Sharon Hewes from
Touche Ross which was repeated
(due to popular demand) and
attracted a total of one hundred and
Winesoc
The Macallan 'War of the Noses'
University Malt Taster Competition
took place at IC on Wednesday 2rid
November. The event was hosted
by ICU's own Wine Tasting Society
and featured four teams of expert
(!) 'nosers', from the universities of
Bath, Bristol, Cambridge and, of
course, us here at Imperial!
A highly informative slide show
served as a warm up before the
actual nosing took place. The task
was to correctly guess, sorry,
recognise the region and actual
distillery of five anonymous malt
whiskies (there are only four
regions but over 100 distilleries).
This having been accomplished
(quite a long process of sniffing
sipping the whiskies—well, you had
to have another taste just to make
sure!), Macallan then offered a few
'wee drams' of their product to help
us relax, before subjecting us to a
distinctly dodgy animated video of
the Macallan process. After this
(and some more drams of the
malt!), we completed the Team
Challenge quiz, on all aspects of the
whisky industry, and the awaited
the results—with the help of some
more Macallan, of course!
Bath won the Team challenge,
and the prize of a case of Macallan
ten year old, but the real star of the
day was Imperial's Martin Pocock,
who correctly named all five
regions and three of the distilleries
and goes on to the National Final
in London early next year! This
performance was particularly
impressive given that the runner-up,
Cambridge's Wine Soc President,
won this heat last year and then
went on to come runner-up in the
final.
In the end a good time was had
by all, generous quantities of
whisky disappeared and we all look
forward to next year, when we at
Imperial shall have our revenge—
and that case of whisky!
Remember ICU Wine Tasting
Society meets every Tuesday at
6pm in the Union Building all next
term, membership is not necessary
and a tasting will cost about £ 4 .
Watch out for details of
forthcoming tastings on posters and
in Felix. See you there!
fifty of you. The workshop focused
on common follies made and gave
an insight into the evil mind of the
interviewer. Future events
scheduled for next term include a
visit to the Dealing floor at B Z W
and an Insight into the Stock
Exchange by a prominent
representative of the London
Exchange and many others.
'What else?', you may ask, well
for the literate amongst you, we
have produced a magazine
'Capital'. This was distributed at
the Freshers' Fair. The magazine
contains articles about many crucial
aspects of finance, written at an
introductory but non-trivial level.
For those of you who have a copy,
I'm sure it provided many
stimulating hours of reading,
however if you missed the first issue
we expect the launch of the second
issue on the first day of the spring
term. To complement Capital, we
have also set up a College-wide
subscription service for the
Financial Times. The service is
available only through the Finance
Society which has access to heavily
discounted copies of the F T at 12p
a day (a fifth of the publisher's
price). These will be available to all
subscribers at the Union bookshop
as of the beginning of next term.
Interested? For further details drop
Lucille Ankrah (Maths II) a note via
the pigeonholes or speak to anyone
on the committee.
Finally for those of you who
fancy being part of this society and
enjoy teamwork and meeting people
from a variety of business
environments, maybe you should
then consider joining the committee
in the coming elections to be held
on February 16th 1993. Otherwise
come along anyway to elect the
committee of your choice.
P.S. Look out for our pension
fund scheme set up with the aid of
our financial adviser Robert
Maxwell, before he went for a
swim.

Board club
For our second weekend away, we
had decided to venture a little
further. Approximately 755.3kms
(there and back) to the sheep
infested countryside of Gower in
Wales.
The trip started well when nine
people turned up ready to go instead
of the expected eight. It made the
trip cheaper, and less comfortable
in the back of the van, I am reliably
informed. The six hour journey was
uneventful apart from a roof rack
strap breaking and Alaric losing to
Rob at 'Bash and Crab'—serious
brain damage.
The other half of our group
arrived before us and nicked the
best chalet and all the local 50p's—
who needs electricity? They did
however bring beer, a Sega
Megadrive, a video and videos
(about sacraficing Mars Bars to the
Wind God—weird!). After a quick
round of 'Worm against Human'
we went to bed ready for Saturday's
big winds.
There was no wind, not even
enough to disperse a fart. Undetered
we hit the beach in true 'Home &
Away' style with our surf boards.
Surf's up dude! But none of us
managed to do it standing up! Later
the wind picked up and so we raced
the land surfers. The old boys
eventually thrashed us. That
evening whilst Fat Bastard Alaric
cooked dinner it got winnnndy. Dan
was fantasising about his Alto and
4.4m sq rig. Everyone agreed an
early night would be a good idea,
fortunately you don't always do the
sensible thing.
Again there was N O wind, but
we still went to the beach and
waited and waited, for the promised
gales. Everyone had a good sail and
the small waves provided an
unusual challenge for most. Half an
hour before we were due to leave
the wind arrived. Alex and myself
had an excellent sail whilst
everyone else loaded the van—
thank you.
An hour later we met Rob who
had sneaked away for a night of
passion, decent food and constant
electricity, but he did lend us his
stereo. It was another superb
weekend and we are all sorry Julia
couldn't make it—we really missed
her!!!! Thanks again for driving,
Daniel—I'm really sorry 'you
missed the six foot waves and force
six wind at the other beach, I guess
you made up for it last Wednesday!
If you would like to learn the way
of the windsurfer meet us Tuesdays
at 1pm in Southside Upper lounge.
