Great Flying Stories edited
by Fredrick Forsyth
This is a collection of short stories
about, yes, you guessed it, flying.
The cover of the book is somewhat
deceptive, with 'Frederick Forsyth'
in very big letters and 'edited by'in
very small letters. Initially I thought
that the stories were all by him, and
this would have put me off had I
seen it in a shop (no disrespect to
Forsyth and his writing, but I would
not want a book full of his short
stories). On looking inside, I found
the other authors included Roald
Dahl, H G Wells, Edgar Allan Poe
and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
With this range of styles, there is
bound to be one or two that you will
enjoy. My particular favourite was
'Cat' by Richard Bach, who is very
keen on flying and owns his own
plane. His other novels and short
stories have been connected with
flying in some way or another.
I think that an interest in aircraft
and aviation helps in the enjoyment
of this collection, though none of
the stories go into the technicalities
of flying. I doubt that all the stories

will appeal, but there is probably
something for everyone and at
£4.99 it is very reasonalby priced.

Kissing the Gunner's
Daughter Ruth Rendell
Having only seen the television
versions of Ruth Rendell's previous
Inspector Wexford stories, reading
one of her novels was not as good
as I expected. Ordinarily I enjoy
reading mystery and suspense
stories, but this was not, as the
reviews on the back promised,
'brilliant'.
The story begins with the murder
of a detective during a bank
robbery, and then moves to a series
of deaths at a country estate ten
months later. Wexford investigates
the later murders and thinks that
there is a link with the murder of
the detective. Rendell adds a family
touch with Wexford's fondness for
a 17 year old girl who is the sole
survivor of the second series of
murders.
Another comment on the back of
the book is that 'there is not one
superfluous word'. This is my only
real criticism of the style of writing
-1 found that descriptive nature of
the story made it very difficult to
get into the plot. I prefer the story
to move quickly rather than have a

20 Runners-up receive a free
copy of the book. Entries
should be in by 15th Jan 1993
at the latest
few paragraphs describing the
scenery.
Basically, I would suggest that
you watch the televised version than
read the book, but as it was shown
a couple of weeks ago, you won't
be able to until the repeats, probably
late next year.

Witches Abroad
by Terry Pratchett
Once upon a time, in a place called
the Ramtops (on the Discworld)
there were three witches. Well,
there were four but one passed on
leaving Granny Weatherwax,
Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick. As
it turned out, the youngest and most
naive witch (I mean who heard of
a witch needing to learn martial
arts), was to become a good fairy
godmother. Unfortunately for she
was to become involved in stories
and fairy tales (a very powerful
form of magic as it turns out)
travelling to foreign parts of the
Discworld, in order to create happy
endings for these stories. Luckily
for her Granny and Nanny went
along to help. But remember not all
endings are happy.
Well, the story involves wands,
pumpkins, voodoo, "headology",
dwarves, pirates, cats and virtually
every fairy tale and story that is ever
worth telling. How these stories are
interwoven is a touch of genius on
Terry Pratchett's side and his sense
of humour and wit is, once again,
superb. This book gave me a new
insight into stories I thought I knew
off by heart and I thoroughly
enjoyed reading it.
I suggest you add this experience
to your life. For those of you that
believe you're probably too mature
to read about fairy tales, witches
and magic, then I suggest you
regress a little and try to enjoy
yourselves as well.
