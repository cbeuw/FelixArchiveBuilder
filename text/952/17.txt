Boo Radleys
-ULU, 5.12.92
Unfortunately, everything's not
alright forever, the Boos live are not
as magnificent as they are in the
studio. Yet, at moments, the true
Boo genius shone through.
During the beginning of the
show, the levels were not set
correctly, the vocals were too loud,
and the overall beauty of the band
was destroyed. This was further
accentuated as the band played as
a typical four man band, with the
vocalist as fornt man-in the studio,
what hits you first are the guitars,
horns, strings and other
unfathomable delights. These are
the backbone, the strength of the
Boos' set. The vocals merely
accompany these, and in mny cases
the lyrics are indistinguishable.
Placing the vocalist as frontman
took away the emphasis of the
guitars so the overall sound
produced was flat and dull.
The Boos were further
The Pogues- Curiously divided over the standing/sitting issue.
The Pogues, Pele,-Brixton
Academy
Pele come from Liverpool. Pele are
like an Irish band, sounding like a
cross between the early Waterboys,
The Levellers, and, due to an
excellent fiddler, Dexy's Midnight
Runners. Songs included 'Raid The
Palace', dedicated to Charles and
Di, in these 'dificult times', a very
fast cover of 'I Fought The Law',
and the tear jerking first line of
'Mull Of Kintyre'.
The Pogues were brilliant,
although it's the first time I've seen
them without Shane. Spider Stacey,
the whistle player, sang well,
although some of the crowd were
calling for Shane throughout the
night. Their set was very
Christmassy, with tinsel and
baubles abounding, and even a
small tree (which was stolen straight
away). The band themselves did not
look full of the Christmas spirit
(rather surprisingly) when they
came on , but this somewhat surly
stage persona swiftly altered as they
began 'Sayonara'. They introduced
several new songs all through the
night including 'Smell O f
Petroleum', 'Once Upon A Time'
and 'Tuesday Morning', which to
me sounded more like their early
records than their last album. The
band seemed to hold together much
better in the absence of Shane, since
they appeared to be a complete unit,
not a star and his band.
They played many of their older
songs, including 'If I Should Fall
From Grace With God', a modified
'Turkish Song Of The Damned',
'Dirty Old Town' and 'Sunny Side
Of The Street'. The evening
reached it's climax with a loud
firework filled 'Fiesta' finale. The
lighting crew were so pissed at this
point they were totally missing their
cues. Personally I thought the
random spotlighting added to the
song, but there were those amongst
us who didn't agree.
Fleur
disadvantaged by the fct that not all
the instruments appearing on the
'Boo...' eps were used live. Thus
the Boos' sound was further
weakened. However, for two
numbers, they incorporated a horn
player into the four piece, and these
were probably the best numbers of
the night.
The Boo Radleys are a great
band, their distinct originality
makes them such. Although there
was no encore, with more classics
such as 'Lazurus', they'll get it right
eventualy.

Pele—Mean Fiddler
So there I was, notebook in hand,
waiting for Pele to start. And what
happens. On they come, start to
play 'Raid The Palace' and my
notebook goes flying, never to be
seen again. For some reason, the
crowd went wild. Can't understand
it myself. It can't just be those super
catchy tunes, in that raggle-taggle
Dexy's style. Can it? Surely not.
How could anyone be so
superficial? How could a band
possibly be any good without a
decent techno keyboard sound
twiddling through the middle of
every song? This band couldn't cut
it in the rave scene, know what I'm
saying? No? I'm saying they're
outstanding, that is what I'm
saying.

Albums
Neil Diamond—The
Christmas Album
It was one the best moments in the
history of T O T P . There was Neil,
resplendent in a scarlet satin shirt,
surrounded by a sea of pre-
pubescent girls looking as lost a
flock of sheep. What the hell was
going on? There was a man,
responsible for some of the best
songs performed by The Monkees,
being publicly humiliated. He does
not deserve it, He is wonderful.
This offering from on high is
packed to the gills with excellent
renditions of Christmas classics. If
you buy this for your Mum, tape it.
Hold it. Treasure it. So people will
try and ridicule you for it. What do
they know? They'll be drooling
over the latest offering being
paraded before the brain dead,
talent free zones that constitutes the
normal T O T P audience.
A classic of modern times

• Out now on Columbia.
A Spoonful
of Sugar
Good cheer to all fat bastards.
Lots of jingle bells, suspicious-
looking yule logs, and heaps of
warm clothing... of the season
to you, dear reader, as diabolical
Dave takes you on a festive
sleigh ride through Christmas
pop, on a dodgy toboggan with
no breaks, and be back at the
hospital in time for cakes, carol
singing, orange squash and any
major surgery involving the
removal of dangerously
psychotic impulses. Get your
mufflers on, 'cos here we go!
Troika: Sergei Prokofiev.
Conducted by Fritz Reiner.
Always loved this; massively
festive piece with delicate but
relentless string-pulses, very
snowy, and hugely reminiscent
of three-wheeled, horse-drawn
carriages. Ironic, that last bit.
Ripped off by colossally unsexy
prog- rock Mother'Ooww!'
Greg Lake for self righteous and
twee 'I believe in Father
Christmas'.
'Wonderful World': Nick
Cave & Shane MacGowan.
My favourite orthodontologi-
cally unsound drunken colonial
bastards, ever, join hands to stop
each other falling off their stools
and, more importantly, spilling
their drinks, in order to produce
another magnificent 'can't sing
for toffee' scenario. I can take
anything from these two super
nearly-dead fellows.
'A Fairytale of New York':
The Pogues with Kirsty
MacColl.
One of the loveliest records ever
made. Namedrops J P
Donleavy, you know. Well-
read, I am. Nice references to
the New York Police 'singing
Galway Bay', and the best
romantic sparring in a duet that
has ever been sung. I'll miss him
when he's dead.
Honorariums to Gary Glitter,
Bjom Again, the Fall, Suede, St
Etienne, Joy Division (Factory
RIP), ABBA, Curve,
Mussorgsky, the Byrds, the
Furs and Kate Bush.
And the Award for the worst
single of the Year... Temple of
Love '92. Because it's the
Sisters, and it's a sucker punch.
Eldritch shafts his own
mythology, in smooth rock
formula. Wanker. Did Yootha
Joyce die for this?
