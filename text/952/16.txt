Jesus Jones-Devil You Know
Beyond any shadow of a doubt, this
is the best record of all time. Yep,
it's even more important than my
whole life, and that's certainly true.
I love the Jeez; remember them
doing the Big World Of Bollox Cafe
thing, with Buzzsaws and
chainsaws? that were great, that
were. Liked 'International Bright
Young Thing', too. Apparently,
they're doin' M E G A - B U C K S
stateside now. Lucky buggers.
The record, sounding
suspiciously like a cover of a well-
known Kylie track, sounds
mysteriously brilliant to boot, and
is in fact, a marvellous slice of post-
punk funk chunky-geetar rock for
landlubbers and people with a
kittenish love for the' lobster
telephone. Get this; it's time to get
your ears sheared off.
Peb & the Diamante Devil
• Out on December 29th on
F o o d / E M I , from the album
'Perverse', out January 25th. Jesus
Jones will be touring in March.
Frank & Walters—
After All
EP5! EP6! The Frank and Walters
release a double C D set just too late
for buying for your Dad for
Christmas. What bastards. It would
have made a lovely Christmas
present. Both CDs feature 'After
AH', remixed from the album, a
lovely Franksome lovesong. I love
it. It's marvellous. Also on CD1 are
'The Day Before The World
Ended', 'The Turquoise Gardens',
a very strange song, and a live
version of the old favourite
'Michael'. Indeed. But the real
treats lie on CD2. Oh Yes they do.
The Franks run through studio
versions of all their live covers,
'Love Is In The Air', that old
chestnut, in a completely Ballroom
free style, 'I'm A Believer', from
'Ruby Trax', and 'Funky Cold
Medina'. Behind you. What's
more, you can confuse your record
shop by ordering one or the other
as they've both got the same
catalogue number: H O O C D 4 .
What fun. What jolly japes. What
further exuse do you need to buy it?

• Out on December 29, on
Setanta/Go! Discs. The Frank &
Walters support Carter at Brixton
on December 21.
Suzanne Vega
— Blood Makes Noise
Has 'industrial clanging' all the way
through, the equivalent of the north,
but presumably Pittsburgh-type
thing (—sad to hear of Factory's
demise).
Strangely mysterious, but typical
Vega ramblings, actually I don't
understand the relevance of any of
the lyrics. It claims 'Tom's Diner'
on the flipside, but is actually
'Neighbourhood Girls'—get it
right!
It leaves me relatively apathetic,
but it's cool and I like it.

David Gray-Birds Without
Wings
Who? Slap it on and have a listen
anyway!
So I did, wow! Urban folk music.
Nice to see the artform isn't dead,
but as an exponent, David Gray is
merely competent. He's got a good
voice, and three good songs, but to
shine in this style you require a real
spark. Unfortunately, he's not good
enough to stand out.
Billy Bragg or Bob Dylan he's
not, but certainly worth a listen if
this is your thing.

Jesus Jones say 'You don't want to meet us down a dark alley way.
BMX Bandits-Serious Drugs
The BMX Bandits are Scottish.
They know Teenage Fanclub. Live,
they even cover their 'Kylie's Got
A Crush On Us'. On this e.p., they
cover Primal Scream's 'Don't Fight
It, Feel It', complete with a massive
array of sampled crowd noises. The
chorus of the title track goes 'Get
some serious drugs' (no possibility
of claiming that's about a geezer
who they met at a club, is there?).
Guess the label? Yes, it's that
darling of the indie scene, Creation,
and the BMX Bandits are a typical
Creation band, which makes this
record a fine exponent of the genre,
and also makes it a totally
unsuitable Christmas present for
Grandmothers.

Out now on Creation/Sony
Bivouac—Slack
John Peel faves, Bivouac sound as
though they come from Seattle. In
fact they're a three-piece from
Derby. Comparisons with the N -
band are perhaps inevitable and
yeah, admittedly they da sound a bit
like Nirvana but who gives a fuck
when they make records as good as
this. 'Slack', title song is a stormer.
A mish-mash of moods that
culminates in a mind-blowing
climax. 'Towald' is like the calm
after the storm, a thoughtful and
melacholic affair. Whilst 'Two
Sticks' returns to the moods
explored on 'Slack'. This is one
fuck of a cool record—rush out and
buy it now!

• On Elemental Records.
The House of Love-Crush Me
Not new material this (recorded
about a year ago, actually), so an
unusual release. 'Crush Me' is
fairly quiet: Guy Chadwick
moaning again, about his girlfriend,
of course. It's a quality track, but
not of fantastic attention grabbing
value.
'Into The Tunnel', on the
flipside, is totally outstanding.
Combining the best aspects of the
band to produce something dark and
tortured that we haven't seen from
them for a while. I was stunned by
it, frankly. I'm glad they've finally
got a grip; let's hope this means
they've stopped mutating into
Airhead (They're Shit-ed).

• Out now on Fontana/Polygram.
Available in numerous varied
formats.
Freaky Realistic—Something
New/Cosmic Love Vibes
I had it on 45 instead of 33 and it
sounded like badly produced
techno...
Realising my stupid mistake, it
wasn't as good as I thought it would
be, those piano breaks I've heard a
zillion times before, and the feel
sucks. Unforgivable. The flipside is
more accommodating and more
vibrant, but there could've been
more funky bass and less of the
love, peace and harmony stuff, the
singing is sub-standard, but the
brief rapping is right on, man.
When I first read about them, I
liked their overall concept of
'Frealism': '...either being too
freaky or too realistic, and without
bringing the two together you just
don't get anywhere.', in fact they
go nowhere, possibly only to the
outer reaches of oblivion. It's a
shame 'cos I appreciate the
philosophy and was convinced I'd
like it.
I should've left it on 45, that way
it would've ended quicker.

• Out now.
Alice in Chains—World
This is an average song, one that
you might start singing to yourself
as you think about what she said the
other time whilst walking along
South Kensington subway. It has an
odd combination of an Ozzy
Osbourne type vocalist singing a
sweet dear melody over a
thunderous bass line and drum
rhythm. When played loud such a
noise can be quite effective although
generally Alice in Chains are just
another Seattle grunge band with
little originality at all.
