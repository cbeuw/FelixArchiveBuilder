Minion Manages Mirror
Shock, Horror, Exclusive! Is Rupert Murdoch trying to take over what is
left of Fleet Street? Mimi Chakraborty looks into the reflecting glass of
the last Labour supporting tabloid.
'Mirror Mirror on the wall, who
owns the most newspapers of us
all?' If David Montgomery—new
Chief Executive of Mirror
Newspapers—were to ask that
question while shaving one
morning, then it's likely that his
mirror might reply 'Why Dave,
your old boss Rupert Murdoch, of
course'.
This previous intimacy was not
lost on Daily Mirror staff, who
threatened an all-out strike on
hearing of Montgomery's
appointment to the three-man
executive team whose brief was to
streamline M G N into a saleable
property after the chaos and
confusion left in the wake of Robert
Maxwell's untimely death.
Montgomery (43), whose
fourteen years in newspapers
include eleven working for Rupert
Murdoch's News International, and
whose previous editorships include
Today and the News of the World,
was voted onto the board in a high
level coup, without the prior
consultation of the Editor Richard
Stott, or any of his senior staff.
Fears that Montgomery would
use his executive powers to attack,
rather than defend the Mirror's
consistent support of the Labour
Party and the Trade Unions, led
staff and journalists to vote to
boycott any cooperation with
Montgomery, and to cease
production of the next day's edition.
There was widespread mistrust of
Montgomery, particularly since he
had been instrumental in the break-
up of the print unions in the bitter
dispute which had resulted from
Murdoch's decision to take News
International to Wapping in 1986.
Staff who had previously worked
for Montgomery at Today or The
News of the World, described him
unflatteringly as a 'failed editor',
who was 'notoriously right-wing'.
Montgomery as Editor of Today,
had, in 1989, urged Today readers
to boycott sales of the Daily Mirror,
because of its Northern Ireland
policy. In return, the Mirror's
political editor Joe Haines described
Montgomery as 'a liar, a hypocrite,
a bigot and a pornographer'. Such
acrimony meant they were never
going to be friends, and Haines
subsequently resigned on hearing of
Montgomery's appointment.
Daily Mirror staff refused to go
back to work unless certain
assurances were met by the
executive, specifically that there
would be no redundancies and no
compromise on editorial policy.
However, mutiny on the news
room floor came too late. A
delegation of senior editors and staff
sent to Sir Robert Clark, the
temporary chairman of M G N on
behalf of the banks, were not
permitted to see him. Some three
hours later, after a vote on the
newsroom floor to refuse
cooperation had been carried by 238
to 4 a further delegation was sent
up again, only to be told that
Montgomery was already on the
board. The executive vote was
carried by 3 to 2. It was left to
editor Richard Stott to negotiate
between the newsroom and the
boardroom, shuttling to and fro
trying to secure an assurance that
the demands of the staff would be
met. Eventually some seven hours
later Stott secured a list of
assurances from Montgomery, that
the staff were able to accept 'I have
definitely got no plans for job cuts
in editorial departments, nor has the
board considered any.. .the editorial
independence of our newspapers
will be preserved and vested in the
editors...I will never sack an
editor...the editors in all titles
remain in their positions.'
It must have been quite a bit of
a puzzle then for M G N staff to
work out how, within a month of
his appointment Montgomery had
fired Bill Hegarty, editor of sister
paper The People, and a few days
after that, Richard Stott, the editor
who had been instrumental in
bringing together staff and
executive, was himself 'persuaded
to resign'.
Montgomery was not the only
one-time News International
employee to be appointed onto
MGN's executive board. John
Alwood was appointed finance
director. Alwood had been manager
of Murdoch's finances at his British
Newspaper Operations, for a period
during the eighties before moving
to Sky television. In fact there
seemed to be a quiet one-man-went-
to-mow style accumulation of ex-
Murdoch placemen insinuated into
key positions at M G N in order to
bring about the October 27th
executive 're-shuffle'. Perhaps
predictably, both the incoming
editors had served time at the Sun,
a fact cheerfully reported by Kelvin
McKenzie's gleeful leader, pointing
out 'they used to work for US, so
they can't be loony lefties'. This
may have done little to cheer up
Mirror hacks concerned about their
paper's political allegiance.
Unsurprisingly, perhaps, a
certain paranoia might greet such a
gathering of the clans of ex-
Murdoch men. (Notably one 'ex'
since they started work at MGN).
It might be argued though, that this
could be wholly circumstantial.
Such is the monopoly of News
International over British
Newspapers that there are few
tabloid journalists who can claim
never to have worked1
for Rupert
Murdoch at all. It also should be
stated that far from claiming to be
a Machiavellian style Prince of
Darkness, Murdoch is just a man
who 'owns a lot of newspapers'.
And why does he own them? T sell
Newspapers to make money'.
That's fair enough, Rupe, no
surprises there.
What is a surprise though, is that
David Montgomery should be
elected at all, and the questions
which beg to be answered are by
whom, and for what purpose?
The weight behind the new
appointments comes from the banks
who now own M G N . Specifically
the National Westminster bank and
Morgan Grenfell who between
them control more than 56% of the
stock. Having lent Robert Maxwell
money for his various business
schemes, the banks had taken shares
as collateral. When, after his death,
MGN's finances collapsed the
banks seized the shares and became
MGN's owners. They appointed
John Talbot of Arthur Andersen to
adminstritive MGN's affairs.
Talbot's chief brief was to
streamline M G N and to cut away
much of the profligate spending
which had characterised Maxwell's
reign. His challenge was to cut
costs, get the share price up and
become more commerical. The
banks went to sell their shares in
M G N , but not too soon at too low
a price. The decision to install a
new team at the helm sends a clear
signal that the group will not be
age 2
