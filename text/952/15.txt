Surf/bike/hike/???
We climbed, walked, biked and
drank for three weeks in The
Dolomites, northern Italy. The
atmosphere was 'holiday' not
'expedition' so we camped near to
small towns with pubs and
daytripped to Venice. Five out of
thirteen of us brought mountain
bikes. Everyone who wanted to ride
borrowed one.
Next year's summer tour will be
to the Pennine Alps, near the
Matterhorn. We also have weekend
trips to Snowdonia and other hilly
places. Christmas tour, 2nd-9th
January will be to the Cairngorms,
Scotland. See us in Southside Upper

Annual Dinner, Derbyshire
Cornwall. Surf, climb or

Summer Tour to the Pennine
Alps, The Matterhorn. There
are walking, climbing and
skiing routes of all standards.
This is a holiday, not an
expedition. North Face rock
climbs for the suicidal.

Sexy legs and mountain goats
If getting yourself into tight corners,
putting your foot in it and balancing
on narrow ledges is what you're
good at then the club for you is the
Mountaineering Club without a
doubt.
Every other weekend off we
goeth in search of rock resembling
anything from Xmas Curry to Sexy
Legs, and we haven't been
disappointed yet!
We travel far and wide. Our first
call of the wild took us to Tremadoc
in North Wales where we
grudgingly slept in ultimate luxury
in the bothy directly under the cliffs
and opposite the cafe, although the
rain and sheep could be endured no
more by Saturday night (when we
resorted to a very Cymru-ish local
inn with Gladiators and poole table,
complete with resident opponent, to
keep our vertical tendencies
consoled). Plenty of adrenaline was
circulated by all levels of climber,
on routes such as Plum and The
Fang.
Stannage and Froggit in the Peak
District was one up on Tremadoc
in that the sheep prevailed but the
rain didn't. We camped (but don't
tell the National Trust) just a mile
or so from the limestone wall (and
less from the pub). Sarah is not too
proud to admit that she led her first
Diff. (—the type of route you can
do with a zimmer frame) even
though Ali and Amos (otherwise
known as Flex and Reach) did hoist
their Way up various extremes and
Martin did a triple backwards flip
on a Hard Very Severe with no
trouble at all. Climbs attempted
were Broken Crack, Three Pebble
Slab (which apparently doesn't live
up to its name) and Diamond Crack,
which doesn't either. Croak-an-oil,
which scales its way up a pinacle,
was also one under the belt.
Croyde in North Devon delivered
rain but no sheep. Instead the most
wicked cream teas you .could every
imagine. Just a brief drive from the
campsite (which incidentally was a
mere 100m from the bar) and a
short walk along the headland and
voila!—as far as I'm concerned the
best climbing yet. Brilliant abseils,
enjoyable ascents just metres above
the crashing waves and some
amazing sunsets can really take
your mind off the fact that the tide
is coming in! Dan can now be ultra-
smug that he led and survived
Kinky Boots (a Very Severe route)
which involved a rather tricky
traverse across a wide Crevasse.
Sarah, on the other hand, can now
feel inadequate due to her inability
to do the simultaneous one arm pull
and Olympic long jump necessary
for the first manoeuvre (feeble me!)
after she had managed to persuade
Dan to go first!
Camping in Swanage last
weekend did leave better weather to
be desired for the next trip to
Cornwall over the weekend of
11-13th December. Anyone
interested in going should see the
club noticeboard opposite the
climbing wall near the JCR, or meet
club members on Tuesday
evenings, after 9pm, in Southside
Upper Lounge). However the gang
can give themselves a pat on the
back for successfully traversing a
skittle alley and stone wall and also
for the skittle balancing feats that
they can now perform with ease.
