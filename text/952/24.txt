Cold Dribblers
Dribblers 3—Goldsmiths 4
We were just outside Sidcup but it
felt like the Yorkshire Dales, there
were fields and streams and it was
bl**dy freezing!
Arriving half an hour early meant
we could keep up the Dribbler
tradition and go to the pub for a
quick half (actually it was a plate
of chips and a coke, but we enjoyed
it just as much).
We started off well with a goal
from Jo in the first five minutes that
left their defence in shocked silence.
Twenty minutes later Chris scored
a stormer, left-footed after her right
foot came off worse in a hard tackle
earlier in the game.
After half time we were three one
up, the opposition had scored two
goals one in their net and one in
ours!
They had a rush of inspiration we
were feeling the effects of a te

women team with one played
injured and all of a sudden the score
was three all, level and six minutes
to go, we were tyring to hold on
until full-time where the ref had
already decided to play penalties as
the light was fading fast. Then they
scored a deflection from a direct
free kick just outside the penalty
area. We fought back hoping to
level the score, Julianna and
Caroline had some storming runs up
the field, Linda in goal played
brilliantly. The defence were
amazing. Well done to: Sue, Sharon
and Jane and congratulations to
Juliette who showed real style in her
passes and volleying.
A BIG thanks goes to Chris and
her dad for the new shorts, at last
we can bend down without being
embarrassed. Practices are at 6pm
Thursdays in the Volleyball Court,
all standards are welcome.

Lady Wobs
Wednesday saw the Ladies 2nd XI
complete an exceedingly interesting
train journey to Cobham and back
without even touching a ball (!?)
('and it wasn't even a 158'—thanks
Nancy). Our 'too sexy' reputation
obviously preceeded us and the
opposition (St Georges) were too
scared to turn up but too rude to tell
us in advance.
This was a disappointing end to
one of the Ladies 2nd most
successful seasons to date.
Saturday, however, was an entirely
different story when we beat the
Royal Free Medics by a convincing
3 goals to 0, despite the loss of our
courageous captain, Rachael Curan,
who had to go off with a knackered
knee only minutes into the game.
(This was after going for a header
the week before and ending up with
a black eye—nice one Rach—it's
hockey not football dear!)
Talkback
The first term of the college year
has proved very successful for a
variety of IC's sports teams. The
Football lst's are still on target for
the league title, and the Universities
cup. The netball team are through
to the next stage of the UAU, as are
the golf team. The rugby lst's are
still on target for the cup, and, there
have been some excellent
performances from all other teams
representing IC.
Through the term there has been
a nice flow of match reports from
many of the teams, as yet there are
some we haven't heard from
though, for example, the womens
hockey, and the tennis club. It
would be good to represent all of
IC's teams on the FELIX sports
page. The deadline for any entries
is 1:00pm the thursday after the
games have been played. Next term
I would also like to see some more
This last victory brought our
unbeaten run to a staggering 7
games in a row—quite an
impressive turn around for a team
that started the season with losses,
which looked more like rugby
results. This dramatic improvement
is as a direct result of an extremely
enthusiastic and committed team
with an attitude (and lyrical talent)
second to none. The Christmas
break finds us at the top of the
league with high hopes for the
second round of the U A U . We
would also like to explain to the first
team footballers that there is little
or no chance of us becoming their
no 1 fan club and as far as ladies
hockey is concerned—girls are
always on top!
Team: Rachael, Vikki, Sarah,
Jane, Nancy, Juliet, Carla, Sarah,
Laura, Catherine, Louise and Jo.
Photographs on the page, so if any
teams would like to have their
pictures in, please come into the
FELIX office with details of the
games when our photographers
could go and watch them play.
Next term the Imperial College
Boat Club will be hosting the 1993
National Student Indoor Rowing
Championships. This will be held
on Sunday the 7th of February.
More information will be in FELIX
early on next term, but this to let
you know anyone can enter, and if
you require an entry form, they are
available from Carolyne Osner, IC
Sport and Leisure Manager,
071-225 8663.
Also next term the next stages of
the U A U start. I'd like to wish all
teams good luck in their next few
matches, and all IC sports men and
women, a Merry Christmas.
Basket Bid
Imperial College BasketBall Club
may be stopped in its bid to play in
an International Student Basketball
Tournament to be held in Moscow
on 31st January.
Imperial's Basketball club has
raised nearly two thousand pounds
of sponsorship, but need another
£2500 to ensure their place in the
competition. A bid has been made
to the Imperial College trust for
some of the money, but the trip's
organisers are not hopeful that the
funds will be forthcoming and are
also exploring the chance of
commercial sponsorship. The final
decision on the Imperial College
Trust money will be made today.
Twenty Imperial College students
have been picked to take part and
will be playing against teams from
all over the world.
