Imperial College student Kirsty
Darbyshire has won $1000 after
becoming the 150,000th participant
of the British Universities North
America Club (BUNAC). The 30
year old club exists to enable young
people to combine work and travel.
The BUNAC programme allows
students to take almost 'any job,
anywhere' in North America over
the summer vacation. Commenting
on her award, to be spent on travel,
Kirsty said, 'I was thinking about
doing Work Canada next summer,
so this will certainly be useful'.
Meanwhile, Imperial College
Union BUNAC Society was
affiliated to Imperial College Union
Social Clubs Committee (SCC) at
this week's meeting of ICU
Council. The affiliation means that
all members of Imperial College
Union can participate in the club.
The club intends staging a lecture
programme in college to inform
members about the culture of North
America, and encouraging interest
in North American countries and
cultures through the BUNAC
exchange scheme. Imperial College
Union BUNAC society can be
contacted through the Union office.
Wealth created
by Dave Goddard
Undergraduate engineering students
may be in line for more money from
the Government. lohn Patten, the
Education Secretary, is considering
extra money on top of grants and
loans to increase the number of
people entering engineering as a
career. The awards would be
conditional on students promising to
spend their early careers in
engineering companies after
graduation. Similar bursaries have
already been used for postgraduate
teacher training courses.
The move to increase the number
of people in engineering was
welcomed by engineering
representatives. Denis Filer,
Director General ofthe Engineering
Council, said that the Government
had 'recognised that professional
engineers are wealth creators', and
added that increasing the number of
engineers would 'not only help to
rebuild our manufacturing sector
but will also help the United
Kingdom to be more competitive in
the international field'.

The General Union Council (GUC)
of the University of London Union
(ULU) held its second meeting last
week. The Council is the highest
student body of the Union, and
serves as the policy making forum
of ULU.
Delegates discussed the break up
of the University of London,
following suggestions by some
colleges about disaffiliation from
the University. After discussion, the
meeting passed a motion urging
ULU to act against any break up of
the University of London. Chris
Davidson, Imperial College Union
president, spoke against the motion
because, he said, GUC rules did not
allow him to speak without taking
sides. Mr Davidson continued that
he thought ULU were acting
'rashly', and that they could 'handle
the matter more diplomatically'. Mr
Davidson later said that it was
premature to discuss
defederalisation when no proposals
were 'on the table'. He added that
he felt 'isolated' at the meeting, as
he attracted some criticism from
other delegates at the time.
Mark Samuels, ULU President,
told Felix after the meeting that he
was saddened that 'the Imperial
delegation felt isolated. Chris felt
the motion was targeted against
him, when it applied just as much
to others'. Mr Samuels added that
he 'got the impression that Chris
couldn't speak out because he was
on the charter review working party
(the committee set up by Imperial
College to review the charter setting
up the College)'.
The GUC meeting also passed a
motion to act against 'fascism and
holocaust revisionism'. This motion
had been proposed at an earlier
meeting, but had not ben discussed
then. GUC also passed a motion
removing any constitutional policies
which are 'ultra vires', literally out
of rules, or illegal. Mr Samuels,
ULU president, denied that ULU
was being investigated by the
Attorney General's office for ultra
vires payments. The Attorney
General's office confirmed that a
written complaint had been made
about an earlier decision by GUC
to subscribe to the Searchlight
magazine. A legal spokesman said
that a letter would be written to
ULU asking them for further
details. Mr Samuels said that they
had not received such a letter, and
that the union had decided not to
subscribe to the magazine.
At the end of the GUC meeting,
Mr Davidson suggested that ULU
should carry out a review of its
procedures for GUC meetings, as
he considered them bureaucratic.
Mr Samuels responded that a report
on the union procedures was being
compiled.
Rethink on voluntary membership?
by Declan Curry News Editor
An outline of the membership of the
Imperial College Union Working
Party on Union structure has been
announced. Imperial College Union
(ICU) Council approved the list
during their meeting last Monday
night. The Structure Working Party
includes Tim Cotton, Nicky Fox,
Mark Summers, Boon Yeo, and
Andy Wensley. Also on the party
will be an Academic Affairs Officer
(AAO) and a Constituent College
Union (CCU) president. The CCU
president may serve as an observer,
as will lonathan Griffiths, last
year's Union deputy president.
The Structure Working Party was
set up as part of a widespread
organisational review of Union
Structure. The review, brainchild of
Chris Davidson, ICU President,
was announced at a Union General
Meeting and a Council meeting in
November. Mr Davidson described
the current Union structure as 'out
of date', and said that the review
should 'leave no stone unturned' in
deciding what students want from
the Union. Mr Davidson earlier said
that the 'staff side' of the Union was
'excellent', and said on Monday
that staff may be co-opted onto the
Structure Working Party.
As yet, no mechanism has been
set up to allow students to make
submissions to the Structure
Working Party, but it is expected
that student opinion will be
canvassed using 'focus groups',
where small groups of students are
invited to give their opinions about
the Union. This technique, used by
supermarkets for market research,
is one of several tools chosen by the
Voluntary Membership Working
Party, also set up by Mr Davidson.
This working party has already had
itsfirstmeeting, the details of which
remain confidential.
Ministerial level discussions on
voluntary membership have been
taking place in a week which has
seen some fevered activity on the
subject by the Conservative Party.
Graham Riddick, backbench MP
and prominent supporter of
voluntary membership, held talks
with Mr Forman last Thursday.
After the meeting, Mr Riddick
moved to dampen speculation that
the Government has stalled work on
the implementation of the voluntary
principle. Mr Riddick told Felix
that he 'was not sure that the pace
had slowed', adding that he didn't
'care how long it takes' to introduce
voluntary membership for campus
student unions, 'so long as they (the
Government) get it right'.
Striking a conciliatory note in
comparison to earlier statements,
Mr Riddick said that it was
important 'to preserve all that is
good about the provision of
services'. 'We don't want to destroy
services. We don't want to throw
the baby out with the bathwater,' he
told Felix. Mr Riddick's comments
reflect unease in sections of the
Conservative Party that the
government's plans may damage
what is regarded as 'good' about
student unions, without significantly
resolving what is seen as the misuse
of public funds. A source close to
a Conservative pressure group said
that the government had 'bitten off
more than it could chew', while a
source in the party complained that
'an ideological approach' had not
taken account of the 'majority of
good things' done by unions. The
Department for Education is now
being joined in drawing up any
policy by the Government Policy
Unit. The Unit, based in the Prime
Minister's offices in 10 Downing
Street, held a six hour meeting on
the evening of Tuesday 8th
December, discussing the different
options on implementation of
voluntary membership.
