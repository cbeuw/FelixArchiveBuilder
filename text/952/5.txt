B e y o n d belief
Dear Jonty,
The Belief of Disbelief
Your editorial on the 4th of
December 1992, dealing with
religion in general, and Islam in
particular, was very interesting. I
would like to, if I may, add to a few
of the points you made.
Firstly, what is a religion?
Basically it is a set of beliefs that
compels the believing to think and
act in a certain way. So the first
thing to point out is that atheism i.e.
the belief that there is no Creator,
is also a religion. Now, the religion
of Christianity for example, may
lead one to pray and refrain from
violence. But what does the religion
of atheism lead one to do? Because
the belief involves the disbelief in
a Creator and an afterlife, the
athiest has one goal in life—material
benefit—be it to get money, women
or satisfaction in his heart and mind
by campaigning against social
injustices. It's all about getting as
much contentment in this life, as is
possible. Thus money is spent on
perhaps, cigarettes, drinks, gigs,
sports, politics, various action
groups etc. But surely it's all a
waste if at the end of it all, you're
just going to die. We should see the
religion of atheism for what it really
is—a waste of time and a grabber
of money.
You asked the rhetorical question
of how many wars were caused by
religion. In answering this let's
consider the wars of the last century
(in which, perhaps, more people
have died than in all the other wars
in history put together). Was WW 1,
in which 20 million Russian soldiers
alone died, caused by your average
religion? Or was it about atheists
seeking material benefit such as
power and land? The same applies
for WW2 in which nuclear weapons
were first used and racial minorities
were systematically executed. And
what of the wars in the world during
the past fifty years. Were they
caused by your average religion or
by the propaganda and politics of
two atheist superpowers, who were
seeking material benefit i.e. power.
And can all those wars in the Arab
world be said to be caused by Islam,
Christianity and Judaism? Or can it
be said that they were caused by
capitalists, socialists, and military
dictators (i.e. atheists) who are
propped up by America and Russia
(i.e. atheists)? The religion of
atheism has indeed caused a lot of
bloodshed.
Any religion, be it atheism,
Christianity or whatever, has no
merit unless it's based on reality.
There's no point in living life
believing in a Creator and the
afterlife, if these are not reality.
And there's no point living life
believing there's no Creator or an
afterlife if that is not the reality.
Which ever is the reality, we should
act upon it—even if that is
sometimes difficult. The reality that
you need a degree to get a job that
you want, may not please you very
much—nevertheless, you'd still live
according to that reality and study
for three years to get that degree.
So what's the reality? The reality
is that your calculator did not make
itself—it was created. The reality is
that you did not create yourself—
you were created. Thus the reality
is that the universe, which is a
billion times more complex than the
calculator, you or whatever, was
also created. And remember, the
reality is that we don't have to see
the making of the calculator and the
maker to know that he exists. Thus
the reality is that we don't need to
see the Creator and the creation of
the universe to know that it was
created.
I know that I can prove to anyone
who is open-minded that the
Creator is a reality—it exists, and
I can also prove that the Quran is
the authentic word of that Creator.
As a result I try to live according
to Islam. I invite you, and anyone
to chat to practising muslims to
discuss with us these realities of
life. Hopefully after doing so, you'll
realise that Islam has nothing to do
with insecurity, doubts or any of the
other things mentioned in your
editorial in Felix Issue 951.

Every q u e s t i o n a n s w e r e d A nip o n the heels
Dear Jonty,
I was concerned to read C . A .
France's letter 'Alarmed' in last
week's Felix and would like to
respond to the questions it raises,
over the circumstances surrounding
the fire alert in the Union Building
on Friday 27th November.
1. As the ICU Deputy President
has already reported, the incident
highlighted the inadequacy of the
alarm bells in certain parts of the
building. Action has already been
taken to get necessary remedial
works underway. The building is
being rewired this week and new
alarm sounders will be installed and
tested over the coming weekend.
2. The door between the Union
Bar and Da Vinci's did not unlock
automatically, because the power
supply proved inadequate to operate
the integrated alarm and doorlock
system effectively under full
evacuation conditions. We have
satisfied ourselves that this was a
one off problem by its very nature
and it has been dealt with already
as a matter of extreme urgency.
Further improvements will be
obtained as a result of the current
overhaul of the alarm bell system.
3. We had two security officers
on duty in Beit Quad at the time of
the incident and they were evidently
able to establish quickly that there
had been a false alarm. It is not
normal for buildings to be directly
linked to the fire service.
4. The College management is
very much aware of the need for the
closest possible attention to be paid
to fire safety throughout the
College. I can assure your
correspondent and all your readers
that we are committed to ensuring
that all necessary safeguards are
taken. Indeed, we have increased
our internal resources during this
year, through the appointment of a
new Fire Office, in order to be able
to respond more rapidly and
effectively to the increasing
demands being made on us in this
area.
May I take this opportunity to
add, in response to two other points
which were raised in your 4th
December issue, that the Fire
Officer, Graham Cox, has fire
training for stewards in hand.
Furthermore, regular checks are
made on fire extinguishers. If they
are found to be empty, they are
replaced immediately. All too often,
regrettably, extinguisher problems
are caused by student high spirits,
as was the case once again at the
Disco party last Friday.
Yours sincerely,
Angus Fraser.
Dear Jonty,
As you may know, I consider
those spineless individuals who
choose to write anonymously
without good reason, to be beneath
contempt. These people do not
deserve to have their 'criticisms
answered. With regard to last
week's 'Beit Back' article, suffice
it to say that the author is obviously
as ignorant as (s)he is arrogant. Not
only was the article riddled with
inaccuracies, it was clearly written
by an individual who has not the
slightest concept of the way
Imperial College Union and its
security operation is run.
On a similar subject I should like
to answer this week's letter from C
A France. Unfortunately the letter
includes numerous misquotations
from my article in last week's Felix
and so is limited in its validity. The
real howler is the misinterpretation
of my statement (and I quote) 'The
only time the 'maglock' doors are
closed while the building is in use,
is during an event'. Perhaps M r
France would .like to crown his own
stupidty, or rather illiteracy!
The one constructive question
asked by C A France was 'When?',
referring to the improvements to be
made to the Union fire alarm
system. On Monday I was informed
by College security that work on the
installating of the new power supply
unit will have begun by the time of
publication. This power supply unit
will boost the sound produced by
alarm bells in the building. If the
installation is not already complete,
it will be finished next week.
I should like to point out that
while I am responsible for security
within the Union building, fire
safety for the whole college,
including the Union, is undertaken
by College security.
As to accusations of criminal
negligence on the part of Union
management, these are ridiculous,
let alone libellous. I cannot
guarantee that in future nothing will
ever go wrong in the Union
building, not that it will suddenly
become a Utopian place where
everyone can live in harmony and
peace, whilst still indulging in their
pleasures and enjoying themselves.
If there is a deity out there who can
bestow upon us such a status, please
do. While we are waiting, we mere
mortals have to do our best to cope
with reality.
Rick Bilby,
ICU Deputy President.
