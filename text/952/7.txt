Rag R e v i e w
Well, what a term it has been. RAG
has raised so far this term over
£30,000. I am truly impressed, cos
this is all down to you. RAG Raids
near and far, crazy events, parties,
competitions. The list is endless.
How do we manage to bring you so
much fun. Well, just in case you're
worried that we may have run out
of ideas, let me put your minds at
rest. Next term will be even bigger.
You want to know why? Well read
on then silly.
Next term is RAG Week term.
'Wot's that then?' I hear you cry.
Well, it's basically the craziest,
wackiest week of term and there is
no way what so ever to avoid it
(other than visiting your great aunt
in Siberia). It runs from January
29th to February 6th and every day
there is at least one crazy thing
going on. Just to whet your apetite,
we have here a copy of the timetable
for RAG week, cunningly leaked by
me.
We will also be running the usual
services (Hit Squad, Killer, Grim
Reaping etc.) so if you fancy getting
involved pop up and see us in the
RAG Office in the union Building.
You maybe wondering what a few
of these events are so, to clarify
matters, here are a few definitions.
RAG Carnival is along the same
lines as an Ents party with live
bands and a bar extension. Also
planned is Bar Fly jumping etc. so
watch out for that. RAG Rugby is
a new event suggested by the Ladies
Rugby team. They have challenged
the RSM firsts team to a match but,

6th Sponsored Nude Kamikaze
Parachute Jump
Morning, Somewhere Near
P a r a c h u t e
Ok, so we have had a bungee jump
so lets now go a little higher up and
take a slower descent. Next term
you can Parachute jump for
Multiple Sclerosis. Now is the best
time to pick up your sponsorship
forms so you can con your relatives
into giving you some dosh over
Christmas. This way you can raise
loads of money and do the jump for
free. A deposit of £80 will be
needed after Christmas but with all
those relatives it will be easy to
raise £130 to do it Free (most of our
Bungee jumpers raised over £100)
The usual rag incentives will
apply so if you haven't yet done
anything with Rag you can get an
exclusive Mug at £50, a designer T-
Shirt at £150 and a sweatshirt at
£300. If lots of you do a jump we
will be able to bring the cost down.
Come up to the RAG Office on the
east staircase of the Union or to a
RAG meeting to pick up a sponsor
from. You can also collect forms
for the Sponsored Nude Kamikaze
Parachute Jump or any other zany
ideas you have for RAG Week.
to even things up, the men are going
to play in wellies and suspenders!
Mines Dirty Disco is similar to
Rocky Horror but taking things a bit
further. Basically, the less you
wear, the less you pay!
The last event of RAG Week has to
be given a special mention because
if you want to take part, you need
to get a sponsor form soon. Don't
be put off by the title because it's
not as bad as it sounds. The jump
is only two feet out of the back of
a minibus. However, the minibus is
parked outside Harrods, you have
nothing on other than a pair of
parachute boots and a harness and
then you have to run back to the
Union. If any of you are feeling a
little apprehensive about joining us
in this, let me add that at least two
ladies are taking part and some of
us intend to walk back!
For those of you who enjoyed
Guild's Hit Squad then you can take
part again during RAG Week. Also
available from the RCS will be
'Pint-o-Grams', 'Handcuff-o-
Grams', Gnoming and Grim
Reaping, great ways to pamper
yourself, get yourself and a
fanciable partner chained together
for the day (or night) and to
embarrass your friends and
lecturers.
If you have any ideas for silly
sponsorship events (like shaving all
body hair) or if you just want to get
involved more come to Rag
meetings every Friday in the Ents
Lounge at 1.10pm or go to your
CCU Office for their events.
Be Mad!
Be Silly!
Be Part
of it!
