Aladdin
This production of Aladdin had the
audience singing, laughing and
hissing and booing at the baddie -
and that was only the adults.
The classic story about Aladdin
and his lamp is told excellently in
this stunning production. All the
cast are perfect for the roles,
especially the dame, played by Alan
Ford. Unlike some dames who can
be patronising or too stupid to be
laughed at, this one had got it just
right. Other impeccable characters
include the baddie Abenazer (boo,
hissssss), played by Michael
Bertenshaw and of course, Aladdin
himself, played by the excellent
new-comer Benjamin Fellows.
If cast don't take your breath
away with their performances
(although I don't see how this is
possible), then the set will. The
artistic director or set designer or
whoever dreamt it up has to be
nothing short of a genius.

Romeo And Juliet
I don't believe that there can be
anyone reading who doesn't know
this classic story: Boy meets girl,
they fall in love, their love is
forbidden, they don't care, they
would rather die than live without
each other, they both die. Okay,
maybe I'm trivialising. But what
ever you feel about the story of
Romeo and Juliet becomes
irrelevant when treated such a
performance.
The first scene begins with
Romeo trying to declare his love for
another, much to the amusement of
his friends. You could be forgiven
for thinking that this ballet was
going to be a comedy, lively and
fast moving. This makes the closing
act all that more poignant as all the
despair, love and sorrow are
enacted so beautifully by the cast.
I don't think anyone could call me
a romantic, but I have to confess
that even I was close to tears when
Juliet finally fell dying upon
Romeo's already lifeless body.
The sets and costumes were well
thought out and impressive, the
dancing, superb. The score by
Prokofiev is well suited and
contains a few pieces familar
pieces. A thoroughly enjoyable and
well recommended evening.
Aladdin
Fiddler on the Roof
What a refreshing change from the
usual Grease/West Side
Story/Oliver round of college
productions U C L DramSoc
provided last week. Fiddler, the
story of a new generation defying
the traditions entrenched in a tiny
Jewish village around the turn of the
century, is a challenging and
ambitious project. The music is
complex, moods and scenes shift
and change linked by a haunting,
contemplative narrative. Cast, crew
and orchestra succeeded in
presenting a wonderful evening's
theatre. A very talented company
was led by the gorgeous Martyn
Gilbey 'debuting' in the central role
of Papa Tevye. The part is not an
easy one, often alone on the stage.
He holds the plot together with his
touching musings and tin pot
philosophies and is lumped with the
show's most famous and difficult
song 'If I Were a Rich Man'.
Gilbey seemed totally at home and
completely convincing as the
puzzled Papa shambling, shifting
and capitulating whilst brimming
over with love in his halting simple
speech, he had the audience enrapt.
Every role was perfectly cast—
from Alex Hayion's gawky taylor,
Bobbie Chatt's firey Hodel (with an
enchanting voice) to Frances
Wedgewood's intimidating Mama
Golde. Whatever the scene; a
wedding, shabbat, an argument, a
dream, the grind, the joy, the pathos
and the courage of the villagers
shine through. The well drilled
orchestra provided sensitive
accompaniment to some excellent
singing and neat, energetic dancing.
Choreography was original and
carefully detailed wihout being over
complicated and messy.
Basically I was very impressed by
an amateur production that was
easily as good as, and better than
much of what I have seen in the
West End this year. Well done.

Trelawny of the Wells
Rose Trelawny (Sarah Brightman),
toast of the Sadlers Wells, leaves to
court a 'toff. Ducky doesn't take
to the highlife 'cos she's a gypsy,
guvnor, cor blimey strike a light...'
She returns to the Wells broken
'earted and mislaying her acting
facility en route. Consquently is
fired, so she and her chums go up
the road to another theatre and act
happily ever after...This nail-biting
scenario(?) is swathed in a script of
the worst 'hand-to-forehead-you-
must-be-my-long-lost-sister'
variety. Against such odds, the
curiosity value of the star-studdeci
cast is an essential diversion.
Ms Brightman generously brings
her 'Christine' to those of us who
couldn't get tickets round the
corner. Every line shrieked, eyeis
'gods'-wards, arms outstretchea,
each sentence heavy with
impending song (this injects a
modicum of tension as the audience
stay alert, earplugs at the ready).
Aesthetic relief from this
orthodontic nightmare is abundant.
Every swaggable item is swagged,
each drapeable, draped often in
some novel tartan, not least Ms
Bonham Carter. Sumptuously clad
throughout, her flawless beauty is
breathtaking. Her acting is not. The
pouting E M Forster rebel,
distracted and blase is, however,
very engaging...again.
The rest of the cast, cursed with
cardboard characters from the Mary
Poppins School of Realism, instil
their roles with lashings of wit and
energy. Michael Horden, despite
frequent and obvious fluffs makes
a very endearing old git.
It's an awful, annoying play but
you won't see it done better.
H . B . C . is gorgeous, the cow!
