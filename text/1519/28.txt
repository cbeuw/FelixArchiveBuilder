The stars have been descending on Imperial over
the last couple of weeks, with Robert De Niro drop-
ping by the Library Cafe on Wednesday for a chat
with Hangman over a frothy cappucino:
Hangman: Hi Rob.
De Niro: Hey.
H: Did you hear people thought that we actually in-
terviewed Will Smith last week, like, for real?
D: Haha.
H: We’ve been running low on inspiration for horo-
scopes lately, have you got any ideas?
D: No.
H: Thanks for your time!
