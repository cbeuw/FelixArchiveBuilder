Palme d’Or - much cooler than an Oscar...
W
elcome, or should
we say bienvenue,
to the world’s most
celebrated, presti-
gious film festival
of the year. Every May brings numer-
ous respected actors, directors, produc-
ers and other famous miscellaneous
guests from all around the world to the
fabulous red carpet of Cannes. This
year, there are 22 films from all over
the world competing for the festival’s
many prizes, and Felix Film takes a
quick tour, highlighting the important
films in this glamorous, highly-publi-
cised event.
The Prizes
Essentially, what people really care
about. The results are announced dur-
ing the closing ceremony of the fes-
tival, where quite frankly anyone
involved in the 22 films of the main
competition could walk up the stage
to nab a prize. Being well received in
front of the tough Cannes crowd, who
are known to show no mercy, brutal
honesty and outright dislike for unwor-
thy films with boos and hisses, is a ma-
jor achievement, and to be awarded one
of the major prizes is an honour some
say are more gratifying than winning
an Oscar.
Palme d’Or – best film
Grand Prix – second best film
Prix de la mise en scène – best director
Prix du scenario – best screenplay
Jury Prize – third best film
Prix d’interprétation féminine – best
actress
Prix d’interprétation masculine –
best actor
Camera d’Or – best first feature film
director
Palme d’Or du court métrage – spe-
cial mention
The Jury
Now these guys are the ones directors
need to impress with their films. Sure,
there are harsh film critics with their
knives out expecting the best of stan-
dards in the Cannes screening rooms,
but really when it comes down to judg-
ing the prizes, the Cannes Jury are the
ones who have the final say. Made up of
directors, actors, writers and other key
influential members of the film indus-
try, this internationally diverse group of
people watch the films in the Official
Selection and decide who walks away
with the coveted prizes.
