COMMENT
FELIX Is the right to know right?
Joseph Kaupp
League tables yet again come to the fore
this week as Imperial College London saw
a drop from 10th to 13th place in the
Guardian University Guide 2013. These
latest results however caused considera-
bly more controversy than previous league
table announcements.
The Guardian’s use of a ‘Value Added’
category, and Imperial’s low placing, com-
pared to its traditional contemporaries in
league tables, has ignited the opinions
of many across the Imperial community.
The category is scored after comparison
between a university’s entry requirements
and the final degree result received upon
graduation.
The Union’s Deputy President (Educa-
tion) Jason Parmar has openly criticised
the methods used by not only the Guard-
ian, but by league tables published by oth-
er league table-featuring publications. Cer-
tainly, it is mystifying that the value of an
Imperial degree is deemed, by the Guard-
ian, to be significantly less than many of
us would prefer to believe, especially with
Imperial’s top ranking for career prospects
compared with other universities. Howev-
er, the aim of the ‘value-added’ score – to
assess the effectiveness of teaching at a
university – opens a whole new avenue of
questions.
Is the result representative of the teach-
ing at Imperial, or rather the comparative
rarity of first class, and indeed 2:1 grade
degrees, delivered to students in compari-
son with other UK universities? Doubtless
there are those who would argue on both
accounts.
It is not hard to understand why this lat-
est news has been met with such a nega-
tive reception. Prospective students invari-
ably make use of such tables and with a
large number of students having to pay in
the region of £30,000 (if not supported by
financial aid) towards their degrees from
next year, making the right choice of uni-
versity is critically important. The lesser
‘value’ that the league table assigns to
an Imperial degree has been an affront to
some who applied here on the basis of a
world class education.
Gaining a first from Imperial is no easy
feat, but the difficulty of attaining a high
grade appears to have brought with it the
risk of plain and simple statistics painting
Imperial in a less than favorable light.
This whole situation simply goes to show
that there is a long way for league tables
to come before full weight is placed behind
them. The reasoning behind the ‘Value Add-
ed’ score may have raised many tensions,
and it does deserve to be questioned.

O
n the U.S. political
scene, a Republican
sponsored bill is causing
quite a stir. The “Wom-
en’s Right to Know Act”
requires females seeking to have an
abortion to first undergo an invasive
transvaginal ultrasound. This is a pro-
cedure that involves what is known as
a “10-inch plastic wand” to be inserted
into the vagina. The purpose is to dis-
suade women from having an abortion
by forcing them to acknowledge the
fetus that they intend to abort. In some
states, congressional members have
suggested that women should also be
made to listen to the heartbeat of the fe-
tus before they are able to proceed with
an abortion.
This medieval type prescription is the
latest tactic being invoked in order to
moralize the country. It is a demented
way around Row v. Wade (an impor-
tant Supreme Court case in the USA
regarding abortion), and is meant as a
firm punishment for women irrespon-
sible enough to have gotten themselves
knocked up or raped. (Generously, Re-
publicans in some states have amended
the bill, making the procedure optional
for rape victims.)
“Women’s Right to Know” rests on
two baseless presumptions. First, that
the right wing has the one and only
moral code. Abortion is one of the most
polarizing issues being bandied about in
philosophy or politics. It’s a moral grey
zone for which there is no consensus.
For a faction to claim they have the an-
swer displays an especially base type of
arrogance. Second, Republicans seem
to believe that women are blasé about
having abortions. Devoutly religious or
incorrigibly hedonistic, it is unlikely
anyone is having a red-letter day when
an abortion clinic is involved.
Although innocuous sounding,
“Women’s Right to Know” is a flagrant
assault on those views that contravene
right wing religious doctrine. And far
too many Republicans find women
justifiable fodder for achieving their
questionable objectives. What is being
called the “war on women” is the re-
sult of the increasing encroachment of
religion into politics and the arrogant
tendency of the right wing to forcefully
prescribe their values onto the secular
savages who are deprived of virtue.
There is a saying in catholic educa-
tion (of which I am a product) that “re-
ligion does not impose, it proposes.”
Except with regard to women, into
which religion transvaginally imposes
a 10-inch plastic wand. You don’t need
to recite the annals of moral philosophy
to know this bill is wrong. It is a cruel
attempt to torture women who are al-
ready going through a challenging time
in their lives. It’s misogynistic and it’s
spiteful.
As always in politics, a variety of air-
brushed half-truths are being perpetrat-
ed to market this proposal. Virginia’s
Governor, Bob McDonnell, massages
the truth by stating: “a woman should
have all of the information possible
before she makes a decision about ter-
minating a pregnancy.” Kristi Hamrick,
an alleged spokeswoman for American
values, eloquently asserted that “it is vi-
tal to protect women’s health and ultra-
sounds are absolutely vital to women’s
health.” This is of course two-faced ba-
loney. It is devious word play meant to
legitimize malicious intentions.
Senator Lin Coleman is right to refer
to “Women’s Right To Know” as state
sanctioned rape. Although its support-
ers disguise it as governmental over-
sight, this proposal is nothing other
than an attempt to punish women for
making “bad” moral decisions. It is
rape by proxy. Plain and simple.
At best the republicans think of this
bill as tough love, wherein the ends jus-
tify the means. More likely, however,
this state-sanctioned rape bill is an in-
strument intended to punish the disso-
lute for their transgressions.
Some might argue that decisions re-
garding moral grey zones, like abor-
tion, should be left to the individual or
to the family, and that the state’s pur-
view ought to be limited by consensus
driven issues. But why shouldn’t it fall
on Congress to dictate morality? Surely
their 12% approval rating is a strong
mandate to supply moral direction and
shepherd our personal decision-mak-
ing. Surely representatives in the state
legislatures in question, 83% of whom
are males, know what is best for Ameri-
can women.
