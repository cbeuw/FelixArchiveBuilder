Over the past year, 10 articles and 231 comments were written about sexism in science
and at Imperial. Stephen Smith’s “Sexism at Imperial College” has been viewed over
7,500 times on the Felix website. Sexism is clearly an issue that concerns the Imperial
community and 631 of you gave us your opinion by filling in the survey. Thank you.
Women have always been students at Imperial College, even though it has always
been a strongly male dominated environment. A lot has changed over the past few de-
cades: Helen Kemp Porter became the first woman lecturer at Imperial in 1959, women
were first allowed into the union bar in 1972 and the ratio is slowly improving, currently
at 63.7:36.3. Imperial is actually doing better than the national average for female un-
dergraduates in SET, which was 33.2% in 2007-2008 compared to 35.29% at Imperial.

Is Imperial sexist?
College life
“There’s a pervasive atmosphere of thinking misogynistic com-
ments are acceptable and that women should accept ‘banter’.”
Ever wondered which departments are considered by the respondents to house
the most sexist students and lecturers?
Aero comes out as a clear winner. More than one in four students answered
that their fellow students are sexist. Aero was also amongst the departments
with the highest proportion of students claiming their lecturers are sexist, only
6.67% though. Another department with seemingly sexist lecturers is Chemis-
try, with 65.85% of respondents stating that lecturers are sometimes sexist.
Students in Mech Eng, Medicine and Civ Eng are also more likely to be sexist
according to their fellow classmates, 62.5 to 72.73% of them saying they are
sometimes sexist.
The award for least sexist department goes jointly to Bioeng and the Business
School. Materials was a close runner up, 42.86% and 82.14% of respondents
saying that fellow students and lecturers, respectively, weren’t sexist. No-one in
Maths, Chemistry, Civ Eng, Earth Sciences, EEE or Humanities claimed that their
lecturers are sexist.
So what can be done?
Does sexism have a negative impact on your Imperial life?
6.67% women and 4.44% men said yes
In the recent Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey, Imperial dropped
nine places. We wondered whether sexism might be a factor affecting the lives
of people here, especially as Imperial’s low scores were in the ‘good social life’,
‘good community atmosphere’ and ‘good personal relationships with teaching
staff’. A small percentage of students expressed that sexism had negatively im-
pacted their experience at this university, however almost 40% of female respon-
dents felt that it occasionally tainted their student experience.

Sample validity
A grand total of 631 students filled in the sexism survey, or 4.30% of the entire student body (3.62% of male students and 5.07% of female students). Out of this number,
338 respondents or 53.57% of the sample were men, 270 or 42.79% were women and 23 people or 3.65% of the sample preferred not to say.
There was a slight gender bias, as 6.49% more of our respondents were women in comparison to the gender ratio at Imperial.
Every department was represented in the sample, though some, as ever, found more representation than others. The most under-represented departments were Humani-
ties, Medicine and the Business School. Aeronautics, Chemistry, Civil Engineering and EEE were also under-represented, but to a lesser extent. Life Sciences, Physics, Com-
puting and Materials were overrepresented, with up to double their proportion of students filling in the survey. Overall, the Faculty of Engineering had the best representation.
Regarding ethnicity, there was a large bias for white students, with 27.65% more respondents filling in the survey than the comparative ratio studying at Imperial. Asians
were underrepresented by 6.53%. Students of Black, Hispanic or mixed ethnicity were strongly underrepresented.
Another noticeable and very strong bias was the representation of undergraduates, as 85.42% of the respondents were aged between 17 and 22, with a relatively even
spread across different years.
Nonetheless, the sample was not biased enough overall to not report on the findings, on account of the substantial sample size.
We would like to thank everyone who participated in the survey and contributed towards its creation and analysis.
Sexist events: some examples include groping, calling
women ‘babe’, sexual harassment and lab demonstra-
tors giving the ‘easier’ task to female students because
they are ‘less capable’

Voting for women in ICU

tiveness
The ‘Imperial attractiveness
rating scale’
The male orientated choice of
films shown by ICU Cinema
The drinking clubs: The Links, the Chaps and the ’22 Club. These
all-male clubs founded in the 1920s were criticised for being
anachronistic, having a selective admissions policy and being far
from the “respectable” societies they used to be. These clubs
however are completely independent from the Union.
Sport societies: they were heavily criticised for
their behaviour and comments, especially dur-
ing sports’ night and ACC, and making it unnec-
essarily difficult for women to participate. The
rugby club and medics men’s hockey club, in
particular, were also mentioned regarding their
mailing list. When asked about the emails, a
rugby player joked: “who wants another boring
email? At least if it’s demeaning to women…”.
Other respondents referred to inappropriate
and sexist comments made to the cheerleading
squad and general objectification of women or,
as some sports players would say, “birds”.

“There can be times when, as a female at Imperial, you feel like a
statistic!”
“I can’t help but feel this isn’t an Imperial problem, but just how
“lads” act in such maleheavy groups. It’s society who has fostered
this “lads” mentality. Let’s blame British society. Bloody Tories.”
“Women at IC are given so many extra opportunities for careers
events, WSET and are generally treated with more respect than
men. ”
“There have been times I felt hugely
annoyed at being a female at Imperial
however I think this was combined with
being from a lower class/income house-
hold than many of my fellow peers, this
is something I felt more angered with
than any sexism issue. But how do you
stop the attitudes of petty little rich kids
who know no better? They are a minority
anyway.
99% of the people I met at Imperial
are what they should be; intelligent and
respectful young people open to new
opinions and most importantly open to
changing their opinions all mixed in with
a dry sense of humour. Have we con-
fused this with sexism at Imperial? In my
opinion, at time yes but I’m fairly sure
the many ‘lads’ who attend Uni’s such as
Leeds/Manchester did so with the hope
of many sleepless nights with various
northern beauties. At least we know the
guys at Imperial didn’t apply here with
the mindset of f*****g everything with a
pulse; they don’t have the chance!”
Sadly, there’s just a hell of a lot of sexist ‘banter’ from some
blokes. For example, dismissing a female lecturer’s opinions on
the basis of being unnattractive or ‘menstrual’.
Sexism at other universities
Universities continue to make the headlines under accusations of sexist behavior. One needs only look to this week’s news and
see the University of Cambridge’s online site The Tab come under fire for its ‘Rear of the Year’ competition. In March, a rugby team
at the University of East Anglia was the subject of complaints over its behaviour, which culminated in its disbanding after exhibiting
racist and sexist behaviour at a party. However, it is not always the student population who are featured in the column inches. In
2009 a university vice-chancellor at Buckingham University was criticized after claiming that female students were a ‘perk’ to be
enjoyed by male lecturers.
We asked what can be done to combat sexism at
Imperial, here are some responses: Since February a lot has happened on the
Gender Equality front. We’ve had a Gen-
der Equality Forum, kindly sponsored by
the Equality and Diversity Unit, attended
by over 50 undergrads and postgrads,
which generated several discrete areas
of focus taking us forward into the new
year. Two of the most important ones
have already been put into action – the
Gender Equality Officer role has been re-
defined, and senior members of College
have agreed with the principle of having
a women’s tutor in every department.
These should provide ample opportuni-
ties for students and staff to address or
seek help with non-gender-equal behav-
iour. We also discussed a Gender Equal-
ity/Feminism society in some depth and
it looks as though this could well be up
and running by next year. Want to get
