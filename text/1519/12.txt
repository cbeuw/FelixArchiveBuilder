Normally running is a cheap affair; running for the
bus only costs several seconds of embarrassment
and the occasional penalty of abject failure when
the driver leaves you behind in the cold. The cost
of running for a sabbatical role in the IC Union?
For most merely the embarrassment of selling your
dignity to secure a victory, begging for scraps of
votes from people you have suddenly decided to
pay attention to after blanking them on campus
for the last few years. Of course there is always a
small amount of spending on advertising but you
are restrained from breaking the bank, well as long
as you can spell your name correctly.
However, compare all of this to running for an im-
portant political office, say for instance President
of the United States. Now that is what those in the
industry call “crazy money”. Well, comparatively.
It’s true that when campaigning for votes for a na-
tional election to become the holder of the highest
office in the land one must spend a certain amount
of money spreading awareness of your quest and
publicising your political views, otherwise people
wouldn’t know who to vote for and you would be the
last choice of everybody in the playground.
One key part of electioneering involves airing
a large number of negative campaign advertise-
ments on local television networks, something
the pro-Romney Political Action Committee (PAC)
“Restore Our Future” can certainly attest to, hav-
ing spent $35 million on attacking fellow Republi-
cans Gingrich and Santorum. However, campaign
finances aren’t always the easiest things to man-
age. It seems some presidential candidates make
more promises than they can fulfil, especially Newt
Gingrich.
When Gingrich pulled out of the presidential
race on May 2, he did so having incurred a debt
of $1.3m in the month of April alone. Although
some of this was paid back his total debt currently
stands at $4.7m, including a bill of $12,000 owed
to Twitter and $16,000 to a political company run
by former presidential rival Herman Cain.
However bad Gingrich might seem it could be
worse. After running in the 1984 presidential elec-
tions Senator John Glenn owed $3m: it took him
until 2007 to finally pay it all back. Some former
candidates have been unable to pay their debts
back, instead writing off their debt, which is not
a popular move with the small businesses that
supported them. But then who cares about small
businesses? Certainly not the powerbrokers in the
Beltway.
