Imperial has dropped from 10th to
13th place in the Guardian University
Guide 2013, the results of which were
published on Monday 21 May. The
guide, which ranks universities across
the United Kingdom, saw institutions
ranked across various areas, including ...Continued on Page 3
Life Sciences cuts at Silwood
Controversy over drop from 10th to 13th in latest Guardian tables
results from the National Student Sur-
vey, expenditure per student, and the
student to staff ratio.
The continued presence of a ‘Value
Added’ category in the results has
caused significant controversy. The re-
sult, a score out of ten, is formulated
by comparing a university’s entry re-
quirements with students’ final degree
Christian Richters
Academic campus Silwood Park is situated near Ascot
results, which ostensibly helps to de-
termine the effectiveness of teaching at
an institution. Imperial scored 4.5/10
in comparison to the leader of the
rankings Cambridge, who scored 5.7
and second place Oxford, scoring 6.7.
The University of Hertfordshire saw
the highest score under the ‘Value
Added’ category, with a score of 7.7
out of 10. The University had an over-
all ranking of 76th on the table.
Imperial did however see success on
the table with relation to the category
‘Career Prospects’. The score for this
category is the percentage of graduates
who find graduate-level jobs, or fur-
ther study, within six months of gradu-
Imperial falls in university ranking
Concerns regarding staff shortages
have risen as entry to postgraduate
courses in the Department of Life
Sciences has been suspended. Cours-
es such as the Entomology MRes and
MSc, Integrated Pest Management
MSc and Plant Science and Biotech-
nology MSc, held in Silwood Park,
are marked on the postgraduate online
course list as ‘’suspended for 2012-
2013 entry’’.
An anonymous report alerted Felix
to claims that an increasing amount of
Life Sciences staff are beginning to
leave Imperial and take their courses
elsewhere. The closures of courses
taught by such staff will affect the
reputation of Silwood Park, famous
for Applied Ecology, Pest Manage-
ment, Forestry and Entomology, and
Imperial as a whole.
A suite of closely related Masters
taught postgraduate courses run by Dr
Simon Leather, including Entomolo-
gy MSc and Conservation and Forest
Protection MSc have been suspended.
Felix spoke to Dr Leather, who is
moving to Harper Adams University
in Shropshire to continue teaching the
courses. He commented that “circum-
stances mean that the future teaching
of my subjects are at stake”, and that
regardless, “I’ve enjoyed my time at
Silwood”.
“I feel it’s my duty that when I re-
tire”, he continued, “entomology is
still taught in the UK, and if I stay at
Silwood, entomology as a taught sub-
ject may stop”. Dr Leather expressed
his concerns for the teaching of such
unique fields in Life Sciences and em-
phasised the intention to move was for
the subject to continue to be taught in
a healthy environment with the right
people, not for personal progression.
Entomology is a subject which has
been taught at Silwood Park for more
than fifty years, and Leather said that
“the events of the last year have made
people feel less settled”, increasing
fears that the department may be lack-
ing a strategy.
Silwood Park President Francisca
Sconce spoke to Felix and said “these
Applied Ecology courses have been
held at here at Silwood for a long
time, we are seeing the end of a part
of Silwood Park and Imperial College
history”, adding “as a student on the
Entomology MRes it’s really sad to
see my course leave. I also feel that
it is very short-sighted of Imperial to
let these courses go, they focus on ar-
