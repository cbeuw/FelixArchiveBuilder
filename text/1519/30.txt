intense concentration, four minutes of
smiling despite the tiredness; but also
four minutes of happiness, four minutes
of fulfillment, four minutes looking at
the people around the pool between fig-
ures and letting their cheers give them a
push to keep going and swim better than
they ever did. And then they came out
of the water, waving at their names and
laughing with relief, with the best feel-
ing of all: the feeling of achievement.
They did it; they showed that despite
the lack of training opportunities, de-
spite having only five girls competing,
despite having two girls who only start-
ed synchro six months before, they can
still swim, and compete a nice routine.
It might not be as good as a routine with
ten girls; it might not be as technically
difficult as a routine from girls who did
ten years of synchro and practice ev-
ery day; but here it is, pretty, clear, and
worth a medal. After all these emotions
they were thanked by the organizing
committee with a special scarf for com-
ing all the way from England, and got
their medal. A little push and their coach
ends up in the water, fully dressed; they
join her, a few last pictures and this is it,
it is time to leave the pool. Eat a little,
take off this synchro make up and silly
gelatine in their hair, have a few well-
deserved drinks and then a good night
sleep. Tomorrow, a little stroll in Lyon
and then back to London; after all syn-
chro is not all, they have to work as well.
Here it is, end of the story for now;
but if you would like to live it next year,
they are going to France to compete
again, so you could join them, whatever
your level; they will be happy to take
you on board and teach you all you need
to know. And if you do not want to com-
pete, well why not still give synchro a
go, just for fun, IC synchro team would
be delighted to introduce you to the
sport or help you practice if you already
have some experience.

London was the
sixth French city,
now it also has a
synchronized swim-
ming team ranked third in the French
University Championship (the French
equivalent of BUCS). With its five keen
members and two amazing coaches, it
was no mean feat for Imperial College
Synchronised Swimming team to just to
participate to this competition. Being the
only university team in the UK, they had
no choice but to try to compete abroad.
After convincing the French organis-
ers that an English university team has
its place in a French competition; fight-
ing to get enough swimmers to com-
pete in the middle of the undergraduate
student exams; and struggling to get
enough training to be ready in time; they
finally arrive in Thiers, a small city in
the middle of France best know for its
knifes, on the morning of the competi-
tion. They found very friendly organ-
isers and French teams to greet them,
but also discovered soon that the other
teams had not been training three hours
a week as they had but two to four hours
per day!
After the usual warming-up session
when they had the opportunity to go
through the last details to perfect, they
have a few hours to eat and get prepared
for the competition itself: make up, put
their hair up and put some gelatine in to
keep it from falling in front of their eyes
in the water. Then they were called for
their training with music: the last time
they could do the whole routine in music
before the actual competition. The pres-
sure is on, not only do they have to per-
form their routine in front of their future
competitors but also in front of all the
swimmers taking part in the traditional
swimming competition taking place in
the same pool that day. They now have
a few minutes to relax and rest before
the competition starts with the duets and
then the team combination routines. The
stress is at its highest; despite a training
well they have to stay focused as this
is their one shot at showing what they
have been working on all year long.
Four minutes of effort, four minutes of
IC Synchronised Swimming take third place out of all French university
teams, reports Delphine Rolando
