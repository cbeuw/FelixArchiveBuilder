2 FELIX
The return of MIKE
As reported in last FELIX (Late
News), MIKE was collected from
U.C. Union Bar on Valentine's Day.
The misalignment then evident has
now been corrected and he will re-
turn to his plinth in the near future.
When the five W.H.O. members
arrived at U.C. to find MIKE's
frame practically encased in half-a-
ton of reinforced concrete they
phoned back to IC for tools and re-
inforcements. Phil Marshall was cal-
led out of a Guilds Committee Meet-
ing and immediately set about
gathering a team of men and equip-
ment—which included pickaxes and
vast quantities of rope. Pook, in the
interim, asked us to donate a sum
to charity for which we would get
the use of rollers, ropes, planks and
the lift which had previously been
switched off. This ignored, the rein-
forcements arrived around 9.00 p.m.
and the pickaxes were wielded tor
several minutes before a rather smart
looking U.C. gentleman—D.J. and
all—appeared protesting about the
mess in the bar and insisted that the
carpet was removed before anything
further was done. The carpet was
duly removed and premises were
made to clean up afterwards.
Meanwhile, unknown to us, cert-
ain U.C. students had walked off
with MIKE's carrier and let down
the tyres of the van we were going
to use to bring MIKE back. After
twenty minutes' further work with
the picks it was found that further
work might render permanent dam-
age to the ceiling beneath the bar.
It was then decided1
that MIKE was
ready for removal.
Unfortunately, the lift was not
working (the bar is two floors up)
and so after threats to ruin the
stairs by dragging MIKE down them
the lift was miraculously restored to
working order. As MIKE was being
taken through the front door fire
hoses were turned on from upstairs
windows—the latter action apparent-
ly seemed to interest the police a
great deal.
The tyres on the van to be used
were then pumped up and MIKE
brought back to IC.
Next day he was finally freed
thanks to Higgs and Hill who cut it
out with one of their pneumatic
drills. The misalignment which had
got worse during all this to its final
state of 3/16" out over 8", was cor-
rected with a 150 ton press in Mines
and MIKE was then repainted in
Civ. Eng.
MIKE appeared at the last IC
Union Meeting and if all goes well
will soo be back on display again.

Of pots, Poohs and Heffalumps
The SCC meeting on 15th February was dominated by two items of
wurld-shattering significance—firstly Mr. Ducketfs request for a special
Unkurd. suitably inscribed, for the chairman of the CND Croup i.e.

controversial talking-point was an application to
affiliate a new club to SCC. Yes, you've guessed it—the Pooh Club.
Mr Duckett's request for a "pot"
was the first item to be discussed.
The SCC Executive were clearly dis-
inclined to let him have one—
ostensibly because they thought the
CND Group might disappear from
College when Mr Duckett did, but
probably in fact because they hoped
Mr Duckett would disappear instant-
ly if they closed their eyes. It was
pointed out that althr>"<r
h Mr
Duckett had applied for a pot before
January 1st (the latest date for ap-
plications), SCC's Constitution stated
that "SCC may award a pot..."
"may" being the operative word. The
Executive breathed again, thinking
"and may not" But someone else, in
a flash of interpretative genius sav-
ed Duckett's day by reminding us
that the Committee had the option—
not the Executive. A vote was taken,
ad in a spirit of apparently pel verse
delight, the members of SGC award-
ed Mr Duckett a pot.
There followed a light and pleas-
ant inteilude while something rather
minor about "Associate Membership"
was discussed. Outsiders, not neces-
sarily students, were to be allowed
to join clubs, but not in such large
numbers that the College member
ship was swamped. Brendan Parker
FORD
MAKES THE MOST
OF GRADUATES
We at Ford offer a wide variety of work that the arts, social science or engineering
graduate can feel is really worthwhile. It ranges from the development and planning
of new products and their production and marketing, to the service functions of
finance, purchasing and industrial relations.
As you would expect, we use these aspects of management science in their most
advanced and sophisticated forms, but we know from experiencethat graduates,
given the necessary training, can often make the best junior or middle managers in
these fields in a surprisingly short time. We value their enthusiasm for new ideas and
methods, while they value the variety of work and the intellectual and professional
challenge that we give.
We're flexible, too. Every encouragement is given to the graduateto broaden his
experience by changing his function: moves from labour relations to production
purchasing, from financial analysis to market research or from product planning to
organization planning are typical.
Further, we let the graduate choose his specialization after he's joined us, rather than
forcing him to do so before.
Above all, we have found that we need graduates of every type as well as every
discipline, and that they can all have successful careers with us.
We make the most of graduates; the variety of work and the salaries we pay reflect
this. As long as we remain Britain's leading exporter and a leader in the technological
revolution we cannot afford to do otherwise.

said that he would rather not see,
for example, 50-50 affiliation with a
club in RCA. Each applicant for
membership would have to he con-
sidered by SCC Executive as well
ac the chairman of the relevant
club, and economic subscriptions
would also have to be decided.
The Committee then got back to
real business. Mr Mackman and
"seventeen others" had requested
that their Pooh Club be affiliated to
SCC. They undertook to organise
the National Poohsticks Champion-
ship should this be necessary. Mr
Duckett asked if this were a Red
Plot, presumably because Mr
Andrew Jordan was involved.
N America Club
It was decided to give tne Ponh
Club application a second reading
when a Constitution was forthcom-
ing. Another application was then
read, from the North America Club,
which wished to affiliate to SCC.
The initial reaction was "Is there
any point in this?" because, as Miss
Selwyn asked, "Is there any culture
in North America?" We were as-
sured that there was. Mr Eseller
commented that .the-
International
Relations Club did a lot to acquaint
people with places like North Amer-
ica, and Mi Drclett said that he
would indeed like to find out mcie
about America—at the moment he
didn't understand it. He also asked
if this were a CIA plot, which seem-
ed rather funny at the time, but
doesn't now. The Committee decid-
ed to give the N.A.C. a second
reading when they presented a con-
stitution.
Other points covered included a
request for something to be done
about the difficulty of booking rooms
for meetings, in College Depart-
ments. It was suggested that a
directory of rooms suitable for meet-
ings of various sizes should be com-
piled.

C.E.M.
favour
fee increases
The College of Estate Manage-
ment have recently come out against
the current wave of anti-Crosland
motions by defeating such a motion
101-76 at their last Union meeting,
reversing their decision of the pre-
vious meeting. The final defeat of
the motion deploring the rise in fees
was largely due to a few effectively
emotional speeches against it, main-
taining that all U.K. university plac-
es should be kept for the U.K., and
it seems that the NUS representative
for the motion delivered a poor
speech. The C.E.M. Executive were
almost all in favour of the motion,
and Mike Slade, C.E.M.'s president
dissociates himself completely from
the result, expressing complete sur-
prise and incredulity. The number of
overseas students at C.E.M. is small
a little less than twenty.
