Dancing club's success
The unsuccessful
"Day of Protest"
IC's contribution
Malcolm Duckett's telephone
"siege" Of the Department of Educ-
ation and Science appears to have
been one of the few successful featur-
es of IC participation in the NUS
sponsored national day of protest
over overseas students fees last
Wednesday; it seems likely now that
the final decision will be left to in-
dividual colleges and universities.
The telephone siege was one of a
number of suggestions offered to the
previous Tuesday's inquorate Union
meeting. This particular proposal was
that as many students as possible
should telephone the Department on
Wednesday afternoon to offer ideas,
tell of problems and register protests.
Tlie response on both sides to this
scheme seems to have been worth-
while. A number of IC students tele-
phoned and all were given a fair
hearing. It transpired that contact
between Crosland and the Office of
Universities at the Department had
been minimal, and that as far as the
Secretary of the Office; Mrs Sanders,
coul ascertain, the final decision re-
sted with individual colleges. Since
the principle of the London colleg-
es is that all students should pav
more, this could mean that all
London fees might go up, or it
could result in no rise at all taking
place. About Mr Crosland's suggest-
ed hardship fund to help overseas
students in dfficulties, Mrs Sanders
only knew what she had gleaned from
Hansard; in general she had been
kept remarkably ill-informed by Mr
Crosland. Nevertheless it is likely
that news of the telephone siege,
will received as it was, will filter
through to his august ears and have
some measure of effect.
Other suggestions made at the
Union meeting were less successful. A
proposed student strike and a rally
in the Union *Quad failed to material-
ize, mainly due to Executive disap-
proval, and the rally at U C was at-
tended by only a handful of IC
students. The basis of this rally was
a speech by a Labour Back-bencher
criticizing Crosland's policy. At the
same time and apparently without
the knowledge of IC Executive, a
rally was held in Downing St. and
a petition delivered. Another lobby of
Parliament was held; no IC students
were present.
Chelsea meeting
Finally at an IC supported rally
at Chelsea two IC students were pre-
sent, a speaker, who was Brendan
Parker, IC Honorary Secretary, and
a reporter. This poor attendance may
have been due to the fact that al-
though IC Executive received not-
ice of the rally six days before, news
of it was only released on Tuesday
to the Union. There were three
speeches, to an andience of eighty;
most of the speeches being in favour
of militancy over the problem and
the increase came under heavy fire as
a shortsighted piece of national-
ism and 'a move to inequality'
Parker's speech was short and fav-
oured consideration of the proposed
'hardship fund' rather than attack-
ing the main issue, the rise in fees.
He was against militancy and broad-
ly speaking accepted the fees rise
as an established fact. He added
that he did not represent the voice
of IC Union.

Tizardians and
the Goldsmiths
The historic connections between
City and Guilds College and the
Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths
is being kept alive by the residents
of Tizard Hall, who feel that their
relationship w i h the Goldsmiths is
particularly close since Sir Henry
Tizard, from whom the Hall takes
its name, was at one time a Prime
Warden of the Company.
In the past few years the merflr
bers of the Hall have been ths
guests of the Company at receptions
at Goldsmith's Hall where they have
had the opportunity of finding out
more about the work of the
Goldsmiths and meeting some of
the members of the Company. The
residents of the Hall have recipro-
cated this generosity in their modest
way by entertaining some of the
members of the Livery at their an*
nual Mulled Wine Party held on
St. Nicholas's Day.
This relationship was strengthen-
ed recently when two members of
the Hall, A.J. Smith and D.C.
Howell ,were invited to the Livery
Dinner at Goldsmith's Hall on
February 1st. The residents of
Tizard Hall felt themselves to have
been honoured by this gesture, and
the two guests were greatly im-
pressed by the lavishness of the
hospitality accorded them.
A.J. Smith
A team of four couples from
Imperial College Dancing Club
gained third place in the London
Inter-collegiate Ballroom Dancing
competition held at Q.E.C. last
week.
This is a notable achievement
since this is the first time the club
has taken part in a competitive
event for many years.
The final positions of the teams
were as follows ;
U.C. 32 points 1st
Q.M.C. 12 points 3rd
I.C. 12 points 3rd
Q.E.C. 11 points 5th
Kings 15 points 2nd
Our best achievement was in the
Waltz where our two couples were
placed 2nd and 3rd. As the results
show, the competition was closely
fought apart from the convincing
victory by U.C. They, however,
have had considerable competition
experience.
The improvement in the I.C. team
since it was first conceived a few
months ago has been remarkable
and with this encouraging result
there are excellent prospects for the
future. In particular this compet-
ition provided good experience for
the Intervarsity competition at
Liverpool this week, in which the
same team will be competing.
The club congratulates the team
on their success and hopes that in
the future I.C. Dancing Club will
be able to play a greater part in
inter-collegiate competitions, at ths
same time continuing to cater foi
everyone interested in ballroom
dancing, from the beginner upwards.
Late News : IC were placed 8th out
of the 15 universities competing at
Liverpool.
