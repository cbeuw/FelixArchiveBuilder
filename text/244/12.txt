Plans for student houses
The Union sub-committee invest-
igating student houses have found a
way for the money to be raised en-
tirely within the College. Welfare
Officer Pete Finch believes that
£100,000 would pay for eighty plac-
es in houses and that this could be
paid off over thirty years by increas-
es in Hall fees of between 5/- and
10/- per week. The committee re-
commends the forming of a Hous-
ing Association to which 100%
mortgages should be readily avail-
able at 7% interest. Several other
schemes for raising the required
capital are proposed including ap-
peals to the Universities Grants
Committee, the Overseas Students
Welfare Expansion Programme, and
to industry. Before beginning such
appeals, however, a feasibility study
would be conducted by a Publi,:
elations Organisation to determine
the likely yield.
The proposal to increase Hall fees
is currently being discussed by the
Halls residents who will determine
whether the suggestion should be
put to the Halls of Residence Com-
mittee by Rex Lowin. A report by
the sub-committee notes that "such
an increase, while painful to the re-
sidents, would not even make their
rents comparable to those already
being paid by students in similar
lodgings"
This report is a comprehensive
survey of the student housing situat-
ion as it affects IC students. It em-
bodies the Collinge Report, a de-
scription of a student housing scheme
in operation at Hull University, and

detailed proposals for setting up
student houses at Imperial College.
It was presented to the Executive
on Monday for their approval.
One difficulty which the originat-
ors of teh scheme did not foresee is
that if the College is asked to help
with the administration of the hous-
es (which is essential as the pro-
blems are to complex for the Union
to handle alone) the Governing
Body would almost certainly re-
quire control of the discipline, etc.,
of the residents. A warden would
be needed to be responsible for
each house, but it is hoped that he
could be a married postgraduate
rather than a member of staff.
On March 11th there is an NUS
conference at Liverpool on student
co-operatives, housing associations
and other means of providing non-
traditional types of accommodation.
It is thought that Tony Duke or a
member of the sub-ocmmittee may
attend.
Cenotaph
Demonstration
Saturday 4th March is to be a day
of universities protest against the con^
tinuation of the Vietnam War.
J.C.C.N.D. is joining with student
groups from other colleges in organ-
ising a London demonstration.
The demonstration will lay a
wreath to the Vietnamese dead on
the Cenotaph at 11 a.m. It is hoped
the group will be led by Fenner
Brockway and that several M.P.'s
will be there. Students and staff will
form the body of the protest and it
is hoped IC will produce a large
contingent. Further details will ap-
pear on posters in the Union.
FELIX & FACTOR
FELIX has joined the newly-
formed organisation FACTOR. As
was revealed in last week's SENNET,
FACTOR is an inter-collegiate news
agency created initially by the edit-
ors of Pi (U.C.) and Beaver (L.S.E.)
to circulate news among college
newspapers. So far, as well as those
already named, three other colleges
have shown interest in ioining. The
giving of news to other colleges
should not detract from the valne
of FELIX since those paners which
orint it will not be read by mem-
bers of IC. On the benefit side, it
mav stimulate interest in TC m what
is happening in other colleges. The
scheme is still in its early stapes and
may not function for a few days.

Boldon resigns
from Ents.
fete Boldon has resigned his post
as Luis. Committee Cnairman and
left College. He did thils in order
to gee a good degree by coming
back next session to repeat his final
year, as otherwise he teefs sure he
would have failed come June. His
county have already promised nim
a full grant for next year. He says
that this should act as a warning
to some people not to let Union
activities take priority over academ-
ic work and that next year he will
do very little work for the Union.
The next Chaiman will probably
be Stew Chapman, the present
Booking Officer for IC Hops. Other
likely condidates are Keith Guy,
present Secretary, and Martin Lack,
Publicity Officer. Pete, himself,
would like Chapman to take over
but the decision rests with IC
Council.

Canoeing ?
At the present moment IC does
not possess a Canoe Club. However,
several Union members feel there is
a need for one and are actively try-
ing to get members for this pro-
posed Club
The Club, if formed, will provide
opportunities for all forms of canoe-
ing (touring, slalom, racing, etc.) as
well as advice on building canoes
when required.
If you are interested in this new
Club please contact either R. Saxton
or R. Lansley via the Union letter
rack.

At ICWA's Annual Party Andy
Powell, Vice-Captain of Rugby, was
elected Mr ICWA 1967 despite
overwhelming prior publicity by—
or for—Mr Pete Franklin. The party
was attended by various members
of the College of Estate Manage-
ment as well as most of the Rugby
Club and interlopers from the
"Valentine's Rave"
ICU - the
experts on RSA?
As ever, the members of IC quick-
ly and accurately learn of doings
outside the College. In this instance
I refer to the Radical Student Al-
liance (RSA). So full of knowledge
on this are the members of IC—
after all there was a letter in FELIX
last issue about it—that only five
people and myself attended a meeting
on RSA organized by the Liberal
Society on Thurs 16th.
The five who were there all knew
a good deal about RSA and were in
fact expecting to be able to answer
the questions of others on details,
some of them having been in contact
vith people closely connected with
RSA.
However, they obviously needn't
bother. IC students know all about
RSA, anyway it doesn't concern us.
RSA's main objective is to kick some
more life into NUS and get students
en masse to take a more active part
in student affairs. Not being a mem-
ber of NUS this is obviously no con-
cern of ours. We could never rejoin
NUS. even if it were to become
totally acceptable to IC students. We
must certainly be nig-headed and
ignore the foolish efforts of students-
of the other inferior universities in
the country to gain a voice in the
educational policies of the nation.
Equally, the action RSA has taken
on the question of fee increases for
overseas students is no cause to learn
about the alliance, or is it?
Comments on RSA in the Press, a
"Red Smear" campaign as I have
heard it called, true or false, it is
no concern of ours. Who cares if a
bunch of Communists, under the
thumb of Moscow or Pekin, gain
control of NUS. The rest of the
country's students can hardly expect
us, sitting right in the middle of
London, to help them.
Doesn't anyone care?
