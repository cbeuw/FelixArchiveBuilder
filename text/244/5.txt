Fees -two opposing views
Sir,
Mr. David Potter's emotional art-
icle condemning fee rises for foreign
students dwelt mainly on the moral
issues—our duties to developing
nations and our community aware-
ness to all mankind. While he had
every right to express his emotion
oii this issues, 1 fear that they
would not carry much weight in
Whitehall. Surely, however, there
is a far more specific ground for de-
ploring the rises, this being the
future welfare of British Universit-
ies.
About half of IC students are
postgraduates and a very aigb pro-
portion of these are from abroad,
carrying out research in this country.
These students obtain University
places by the same process of com-
petition as do those from the Unit-
ed Kingdom, therefore attain the
same high standard in their studies
and add considerably to scientific
knowledge. Discouraging such stud-
ents to study in this country may
increase the availability of university
places, but as the demand for
these places drops, it might be in-
ferred diat the cahhie of students
will fall.
Furthermore, at all University
levels exchange of problems and
ideas among students from diffenng
backgrounds, be they from develop-
ing African nations, from the United
States or from Great Britain, can
only be conducive to progress.
The 5 million pounds spent on
foreign students should be regarded
as an investment bringing its due
return anc not as a charity. It is
interesting to note that West Ger-
man Universities, which, like those
in Britain have a high proportion
of foreign students, charge fees for
everyone of the order of £20 per
annum, and of this half is medical
insurance!
The brain drain is already troubl-
ing Britain. With the new measures,
some of the potential flow will not
even be caught in the run-off.
Having lived here all my lite, I
feel I speak as an English student.

Sir,
in the past weeks the action taken
to persuade the Government to
abandon the proposed increases in
fees for overseas students seems to
have reached the level of mass
hysteria. The arguments for and
against this rise seem to have been
lost in the fury of the stampede
against Mr Crosland that followed
his announcement of the increase.
Whilst it is doubtless morally laud-
able that we should show complete
disregard for our English bredieren
and show concern only for those who
inhabit other parts of the globe I
doubt very much if your contrymen
think of others and not themselves.
Mr Crosland's duty is to represent
the people of this country who
elected him.
In Britain "there is a shortage of
university places available if the
Robbins Report is to be believed.
Britain is also in economic difficult-
ies. Does die British taxpayer pay
his large taxes so that a foreigner
who pays practically nothing may at-
tend a university which has no room
for his own sons? Charity is fine, but
Due to the lack of space this
week, many letters have been with-
held. It is hoped to publish them
in the next issue.
charity begins at home. Whilst we
have a shorage of university places
should not those who pay for them
have die opportunity to use them?
It is, however, disagreeable to
charge the fees for those part-wav
through a course of study. Once we
have quoted our price we should
stick to it. However, it would seem
reasonable to charge new students
more.
I would further suggest that over-
seas students lobby their own gov-
erements to pay this reasonable in-
crease (there is still a heavy sub-
sidy.) For it is the duty of their
people not ours to educate them,
after all it is their government which
collects taxes from their parents.

P.S. Perhaps a quorum of one at
Union meetings would enable mot-

Safety
Sir,
During November '66 FELIX
carried an article containing reports
of interviews with the Chairman of
the College Safety Committee and
myself, as Secretary of the College
Branch of the A.Sc.W Subsequent
to this your article was reproduced
and officially circulated to the mem-
bers of the College Safety Com-
mittee. This was excellent, since it
conveyed students' opinion dnect to
the College Safety Committee.
I believe it is timely to bring
the question of safety at Imperial
College once again into your
columns.
It is, for example, worth restat-
ing the fundamental principle that
as safety matters directiy concern
students, they, as a well-defined
group have a right to representat-
ion. Indeed, a recent conference on
safety matters organised jointly by
the T.U.C. and the Confederation
of British Industries, supported by
the Ministry of Labour, reaffirmed
the same principle. It appears that
legislation along these lines of
direct representation on industrial
safety committees was introduced
in 1927, but later shelved,'and the
Conference thought that^ some ^Such
legislation should be 'brought in
during the 1960's. This has so stim-
ulated the T.U.'s in the educational
field, that joint discussions are now
taking place.
Probably the most important
question in safety is what happens
if, an Imperial College student lias
such a senous accident that his or
her future life and/or career is
shattered. We know that Imperial
College is insured to some extent
against accidents to College staff
and students, but it has never been
made clear what would happen in
such a serious accident. We would
argue that Imperial College has the
responsibility to make the normal
substantial cash payment if such a
tragedy occured, so that the stud-
ent concerned would not suffer sub-
sequent economic hardship. Further,
we would like to see this situation
carefully clarified1
before there is any
test case.
Finally, may I say that students
should be light-hearted and full of
'joie de vivre' in many things, but
in some things they have to be res-
ponsible, and safety is one of these.
