FELIX 11
ATHLETICS
The start of the Hyde Park Relay sees a hundred teams set off to run over
the eighteen mile course. When the inaugural race took place, in 1949,
there were only nine entries.

The Sir Roderic Hill Cup was
again won by Edinburgh Univ-
ersity, who bettered their re-
cord-breaking run last year by
28 seconds, with an overall time
of 85 min. 24 sees. They took
the lead on the fourth lap and
never looked back. Every mem-
ber of the team, which, incident-
ally, won the B.U.S.F. Cross
Country Chamionship on Febru-
ary 4th, returned lap times be-
low 14 min. 25 sees., so that, at
the finish, they were \ \ minutes
clear of the second team, Shef-
field University; Loughborouh
Colleges took 3rd place. Eaiber
in the race the pace had been
set by St. Catherines College,
Oxford, whose two stars, John
Waterhouse, and Fergus Murray
led the field during the first and
second laps.
The IC team were placed higher
than last year, but could only
manage 20th position in the highly
competitive field of 88 teams from
universities and colleges all over
Britain, plus seven teams from
Germany, France and Belgium. The
college cross country club's top
man Nick Barton, running the third
3-mile lap, pulled them up from
38th to 13th with a time of 13 min.
54 sees., which was the fastest lap
up to that stage. He handed over
to Tony Mason who ran a very good
15 min. 8 sec. lap and moved the
IC team up to 11th place. The pace
from this stage, however, became
too hot, even for the gallant efforts
of IC's two Godiva Harriers run-
ners. Howard Smith and Ian Jones.
University College, traditional
rivals of the IC club, were the best
placed London college at 4th, with
Borough Road College finishing hard
on their heels at 5th, to retain the
Imperial College Union Cup. This
was Borough's third consecutive suc-
cess in the competition which is for
colleges with less than 500 male
students.
The strong, cold wind was, no
doubt, one of the reasons why the
individual lap record of 13min 35
sec, set up last vear bv Mike
Turner of Queen's, Cambridge, was
not broken. Mike Tagg of Reading
University, probably Britain's most
promising young distance runner,
came closest with a time of 13 min.
41 sec.
The innovation of a computer this
year, to check the results was not
particularly succesful, as might have
been expected for the first attempt,
and in fact it was 4 a.m. on Sunday
before the -results were completed
by hand. Nevertheless, the exper-
ience gained will be valuable and
next year should produce the full
fruit of subsequent modifications to
the programme.

At the first full winter league
match for some time, on Feb. 11th,
IC proved to be the dominant col-
lege, winning all the jumps and
most of the track events.
As usual, Richard Beck asserted
his authority on the track commenc-
ing with a win in one of the 220yd.
races, in a time of 23.1 sec.—fract-
ionally better than his previous best
this winter. Later he shattered the
opposition—including reigning U.L.
Champion Chris Marchese—when he
stylishly speeded round the track to
win the 440 yd. in 50.7 sec.
Our other outstanding competitor
was Paul Jones who showed now
he has benefited from consistent
training by winning the triple jump,
with- a personal best of 43' 10", in
spite of taking off before the board.
Chris Power' was second with a best
jump nearly three inches less than
Paul's.
A dissatisfied Derek Wad" again
won the long jump but was stil. un-
able to jump much more than 20'—
well below his best Dave Downie
dragged himself out of bed to reach
Motspur in time to compete in the
pole vault, retiring, the victor, after
clearing 10 ft.—approaching his
personal best-, when still at school.
He later was second, with 5ft6, in
the high jump, won, as usual, by
Mike Evans who, because of a slight
injury, was unable to better 5ft9.
Dave Dallman easily won the 880
against minimal opposition, having
made the running virtually from the
start and had no need to push him-
self at all. Dave Everitt and Ian
Winship also competed.
It was a successful morning for
the college though it must be re-
membered that the standard of the
opposition at these meetings is not
truiy indicative of the highest avail-
able in the university, as many
athletes do not appear until the
summer term—so that our athletes
won't find it so easy to win in the
University Championships.
As the field thins out the Late Flash : Computer pro-
lpnliness increases, but for some duced correct results two days
there is company. later.

As a result of their performances
in the league match, a number of
IC athletes represented the Univers-
ity in an indoor match at Cosford,
against the R.A.F. and Lough-
borough Colleges, the following
Saturday.
However, they did not have a
greatly successful time against these
stronger teams, with the exception
of Derek Wade who, in winning the
long jump, returned to his best form
with a leap of 22ft. Our represent-
ation did not disgrace itself at all—
Mike Evans and Male Weaver
clearee 6' and 5'11" respectively in
the high jump, and Dave Downie
managed 10ft6 in the pole vault.

Running on boards for the first
time Richard Beck realised his
ignorance of this ast and was beaten
into second place in the 300yds,
more by tactical, than athletyc,
superiority.
Nevertheless, vital experience was
gained and the competition was
worthwhile for all concerned.

THE RIFLE CLUB are faced
with a full term, as far as fixtures
are concerned. The intercollegiate
matches continue, and on top of
those there are the annual internal
competitions. The College will be
well represented at the London
Small Bore Championships, and the
U.L. Full Bore Trials, which are
being held in March
The club is progressing well in
the shoulder to shoulder matches of
the Engineers' Cup. The first team
has been doing particularly well,
and against U.C. (acknowledged as
the leading opposition) set up a new
IC record of 576 points. The Col-
lege won the first round by one
point, 572 - 571, and drew the
second on 576..
Results to date are:—
