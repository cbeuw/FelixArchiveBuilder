IC 2 : KINGS 2.
THIS WAS a close game of water-polo, although IC were
unlucky not to win, owing to some doubtful decisions by the
referee, especially in the final minute.
The first quarter ended with no goals having been scored, as the
defences were on top. However, in the second quarter IC took the
lead, when Price went up to centre forward. IC looked like keeping
this lead, but half way through the third quarter Collier was sent out,
for impeding a Kings player. With an extra man it was only a matter
of time before Kings scored, but the manner in which they did so was
oppn to some doubt. As a result of this there was some disagreement
between the referee and Mills, in the College goal. This ended when
Mills was asked to leave the water, and with Collier returning, this
still left IC one man short. The prospect was rather black but Kings
failed to mak« use of their advantage, and the third quarter ended
with die scores level.
With the opposition in this mood IC were able to fight back, and
went into the lead through Mayock. The College were now hack at
full strength, but couldn't keep the lead In the last 30 seconds Kings
were awarded a penalty, albeit doubtful Mills had no chance, in goal,
and the game ended a two all draw.
A N D T H E N
SWIMMING IC 37 pis R.M.A. SANDHURST 40 pts.
WATER-POLO IC 7 pts RM.A. SANDHURST 1 pt.
THE COLLEGE were entertained to a very good swimming and water-
polo match by the R.M.A. Sandhurst and were unlucky to lose a very
close swimming match, but won the water-polo easily.
After the individual swimming events the points were quite close,
IC taking first and second places in the Individual Medley, through
Hook and Maycock. Collier and Fairbum did likewise in the Butterfly,
and the former paii finished first and third in the Backstroke. However,
Sandhurst had taken maximum points in the Breaststroke and had won
the Freestvle. Thus the result depended on the relays, both of which
were won by the R.M.A., and diis gave them an overall victory. The
Medley relay was only won by six inches, but the Freestyle was a much
easier victory for Sandhurst.
Although the swimming was lost, IC gained an easy win in the water-
polo game, by 7 goals to 1. There never seemed to be any doubt who
were to be the victors. The scorers for IC were: Collier 5, Mills 1,
Howarth 1.
