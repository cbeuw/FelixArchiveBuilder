Skills Workshops
In a competitive job market, having a good
degree is not always enough to land you the job
that you are after. In fact, roughly 50% of
degree level jobs are now open to graduates of
any subject. Having the right skills is one way
to make sure that your CV stands out from the
crowd. What's more, these skills will ease your
progress through the trials of interviews and
assessment centres.
Imperial College Union has recognised that
our students need more to offer than just their
degree, so we are in the process of setting up
the Employer Led Skills Workshop Programme.
The employer led skills workshop pro-
gramme is designed to develop key skills which
top employers often state that candidate's lack.
Participants will gain direct but informal con-
tact with a range of employers, getting advice
directly from the top employers.
We have set up a number of sessions with
top companies, who as top graduate recruiters
of Imperial College Students, are coming along
to take part in a session at Imperial College
Union. Examples of sessions we are running
are:
•Surviving an assessment centre
•Based Interview Techniques
•Choosing the right job
•Applying with success
•Application forms and interview skills
•Interview techniques
•Communication skills
Please see the list of dates and times when
we hope to run the programme. To sign up,
please fill in the booking form on the back and
return to Nick Gore Student Activities Manager
at Imperial College Union.
