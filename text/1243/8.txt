Finding out about Shell
will really take you places.
Join us for the evening to find out about the exciting employment and pre-employment
options Shell has to offer. We'll give you an insight into the career opportunities available
and you'll also have the chance to chat to current Shell employees over food and drinks.
Whatever year of study you are in, whatever discipline, you'll be more than welcome.
And did we mention that we'll also be giving away a top-of-the-range mountain bike
on the night?
