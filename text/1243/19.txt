How cool! You log onto this site and the first
thing it does is tell you which windows edition
you are using! Well it impressed me anyway.
This is an excellent but unofficial trou-
bleshooting page for Microsoft users; it has
tips, hints and advice for Windows 95, 98,
2000, Me and XR This includes everything
from the very basic for first time windows users
to how to deal with the many different types of
problems that Windows can create. The annoy-
ances section deals with simple problems
while also allowing you to filter those that are
not applicable to your edition of Windows,
such as turning off CD-ROM auto run and stop-
ping annoying programs that open automati-
cally every start up. The troubleshooting sec-
tion deals with more complex problems such
as trying to get DOS games working and
upgrading the mother (ship) board (sorry,
couldn't resist).
The other side to this site is the humour sec-
tion, some of which is really very funny and
most of which is anti-Windows, they are sent in
by site users so join in if you wish. One my
favourites is a take-off of The Raven by Edgar
Allen Poe, entitled 'Abort, Retry, Ignore?' it is
very cleverly done and amusing too. Another
particularly good one is the script describing
how Microsoft Windows causes the destruction
of the borg in Star Trek: Lost Episode.
Annoyances is a good website to have a lit-
tle look around when you're bored as well as
News ar*l MhjhKqhl*:
News ar*l MhjhKqhl*:
News ar*l MhjhKqhl*:
being excellent at sorting the little problems
that can occur with the joy of Windows. Note
to Bill Gates: Please don't sue me.

Main page - strip of the day included - read
it and you'll know when I wrote this

OK, it's fess up time, I'm a bit of a Dilbert fan
or more specifically a Dogbert fan. For those
of you have no idea (though I imagine most of
you do) what I'm talking about Dilbert is a
comic strip that was launched in 1989.
Dilbert is an over zealous engineer with a pas-
sion for random gadgets and gizmos and a
total inability to interact socially. His closest
companion is Dogbert. Dogbert is an individ-
ual of the canine variety with the ability to
talk, he is very cynical and sarcastic and
doesn't mind sharing it. These are the two
main characters there is also his boss, a mas-
ter at being the world's least liked human
being and his co workers who seem to suffer
from a severe case of clinical stupidity.
It is a misplaced belief that you have to be
a computer geek to understand Dilbert and
his workmates, whereas in fact anyone who
has ever had to deal with anyone else ever is
likely to find something that they can associ-
ate with.
Anyway, this website has many of his car-
toon strips with the option of having a comic
strip emailed daily to you. There are games, e
cards, Dilbert character cursors/ wallpaper/
screensavers as well as introductory informa-
tion on the characters, news and history.
I enjoyed spending time browsing through
the archive of comic strips that goes back one
month. The subscription page for daily Dilbert
is a little dauntingly large considering it is just
for a cartoon but you don't have to fill most of
it in. If you like Dilbert then subscribe to get
a daily chuckle when you check your email.
The armadillo's name is Emily and her star
sign is libra.

IP address
This is a way of identifying your computer in a
totally unique way, i.e. something better than
'That heap of junk that sits in the corner and
crashes'. It consists of 32 bits usually repre-
sented as four numbers which can be any-
thing from one to two hundred and fifty five,
for example 120.14.205.78 could be an IP
address. When you connect to the internet
your computer is assigned an Internet Protocol
address so that you can be identified by other
computers in order to send and receive infor-
mation. If you want to find the IP address of
your computer visit www.ed-
phys.fr/htbin/ipaddress - highly exciting stuff.

Wotcha. It's me again. They didn't sack me,
woohoo! This weeks little gems include a very
helpful one for your favourites list for when the
'uncrashable' Windows crashes, which of
course it doesn't, ever. Windows is great and
we all love it. Is that enough grovelling?
Secondly, for a little bit of fun I suggest you
go see Dilbert, he always manages to make
me feel like I have a life anyway.
I would also like to encourage you to send
in your own recommendations for websites.
Just send in the url and why you think it is
useful/ fun/ pointless so that I can take a look.
Send in to the Felix address because they
haven't given me one yet. HINT. XXX
