5/5
*l 1
The Music certainly chose a
name to live up to - a name that
suggests complete control of
melody, harmony, rhythm and
timbre - and live up to it they
have. If an alien came to earth
today, walked up to me and said
'explain music', I'd just give it
this album. Dirty, rolling guitar
riffs, bouncy drum beats and a
gruff yet interestingly charming
lead vocal make these four
Leeds boys into something
amazing. Add in rock, jazz and
indie influences (can you say
ske-bop-a-doodle?) and it's
just... mindblowing.
The Music got together on the
premise that there was 'nowt
else to do', and started touring
just over a year ago when they
finished school. They've been on
the road almost constantly
since. They've supported The
Charlatans, New Order, The
Doves and Oasis - pretty hard
acts to warm up for - and have
been loved at every single gig.
So what have they got that all
those other new bands don't?
Energy. Life. A passion for
music. Every single member of
The Music is completely
obsessed with what they're
doing - making music to enter-
tain and help people. Making
people happy! Oh, and they
have a really pretty sleeve for
their album. Circles! Rainbow!
Woo! The People and Take The
Long Road And Walk It were
both previously released as EPs,
and they're probably the best
tracks on the album. Both are
bouncy, fun, yet really rocky
tracks with old-school noises
and delicate harmonies sprin-
kled throughout. Think distor-
tion and lots of it. Think bounc-
ing around like a crazed lunatic.
Think tartrazine and sugar rush.
Think guitar music you can
dance to, and think how cool
that is!
Disco and The Dance, both
live favourites, have come out
really well on record. They still
contain most of the energy of the
live performance although to
really appreciate The Music
you'll have to go out of your way
to see them live. Which should-
n't be a problem, considering
how much they tour.
But enough of me rambling
on! Quick, go out and buy this
album, then have a party and
turn it on and turn it up. Watch
people dance. And dance your-
self. And then go to bed and
consider it a job well done. After
all, you probably have lectures
tomorrow morning.

The Crescent 3/5
T h e C r e s c e n t
The Crescent are another prod-
uct of Liverpool, but are they
worthy of all the attention?
Admittedly, it's unfortunate for
The Crescent that they, along
with The Music and The Coral
have been met with so much
hype and expectation.
As seen many a time before,
the consequence of hype is that
a band very rarely delivers; peo-
ple expect too much and are
usually disappointed. This
reviewer decided to ignore it all,
and listen to The Crescent for
their own merits.
With so many bands nowa-
days, you hear a bit of every-
thing in the Crescent. Maybe,
it's just the accents, but I can
hear many acclaimed Scousers
among them; The Beatles, the
La's and Cast.
The Beatles connection goes a
little further, as the band insist-
ed that they used studio 2 at the
Abbey Road recording studios in
which The Beatles played.
Another heavy influence is
that from North-West neigh-
bours Oasis; as it could be said
The Crescent have produced the
album that Oasis should have
done after What's the Story
Morning Glory.
The strong point of this album
is that The Crescent don't pre-
tend to be anything they're not,
and that is a good raw melodic
rock band. The songs on this
album are well crafted and
sometimes hippy-ish, like the
opening track On the Run which
sets the style and pace for the
entire album.
The highlight, or lowlight, take
it as you please, is the sound-
alike of Paul Weller and the
Levellers, especially on top sum-
mertime sing-along, Streets of
Tide.
It's best not to expect the
greatest things from The
Crescent just at the moment,
but what you can expect is
music that you can turn up real-
ly loud and annoy the neigh-
bours with.

Singles
JJ72 - Formulae
Yay! JJ72 return from the
depths of the recording studio
with more twinkly guitared,
falsetto-vocalled madness. Or
not madness, as it were, but in
fact a very well-structured
piece of music. The haunting
tones of Mark Greaney and his
echoing guitars make JJ72
what they are - an indie-pop
band to be revered and loved.
Yes, boys and girls, they're still
cool!
Formulae is no exception
and plus as well* it has good
lyrics that you can really, you
know, relate to. In a cool, emo
hip kind of way.
They're not goth, you know.
5/5
Frou Frou - Must Be Dreaming
Two-piece Frou Frou first
came to the attention of the
public this summer with their
delicate dance hit Breathe In,
and Must Be Dreaming is just
more of the same. At first it
sounds a little like Craig David
is about to burst into song
(leaving you cringing just in
case), but as soon as Imogene
starts to sing this song is com
pletely amazing. It positively
oozes sexy, breathy vocals and
intricate guitar and drum work.
Take a listen before you rush
out and buy it though, as it may
not be everyone's cup of tea.

Feeder - Come Back Around
Bands are a bit like people, you
know. Some you hate, some
you love. Some always seem to
be the life and soul of the party,
while others are just... there.
Feeder are the quiet kid with
the guitar in their bedroom
who gets a bit hyper and
obnoxious when they get drunk
