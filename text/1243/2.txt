Freshers Finale
Last weeks' programme of Freshers
Week events finished last Friday
with the sold-out Superheroes Ball
at the Union in South Kensington.
1200 students with a wide range
of super powers descended on the
Beit Quad site where two dance-
floors, chill-out room and bizarre
inflatable-based sports were on
offer.
The event was the last to see
involvement from Ham Al-Rubaie,
who recently left the post of
Entertainments Manager, but it was
mainly organised by Waml Islam
who took over the position until a
permanent member of staff could be
found.
The new ents manager is
Malcolm MacPherson, who said the
Ball was a "brilliant party" and was
pleased to see all the "amazing cos-
tumes". His new programme of
entertainment starts in around two
weeks with "lots of new stuff".
Unlike some previous managers
coming into the job, he vigorously
denied that he would try to do away

OBJECTIVISM:
THE PHILOSOPHY OF
AYN RAND
LEONARD PEIKOFF
M y philosophy, Objectivism, holds that:
1.Reality exists as an objective absolute — facts are facts, independent
of man's feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.
2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material
provided by man's senses) is man's only means of perceiving reality,
his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic
means of survival.
3. Man — every man — is an end in himself, not the means to the ends
of others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to
others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational
self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of
his life.
4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a
system where men deal with one another, not as victims and
executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free,
voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may
obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no
man may initiate the use of physical force against others. The
government acts only as a policeman that protects man's rights; it uses
physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its
use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full
capitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a
complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for
the same reasons as the separation of state and church.
