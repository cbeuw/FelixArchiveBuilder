Interview of the Week
T O P L O A D E R
So why do you think people hate
you all so much?
I think that really we're an easy
target basically aren't we. The
people that do hate us are them
(points to copy of NME in front of
us) but they'll slag anyone off
really. I mean they'll slag
Radiohead off next week and they
gave them the cover this week.
Overall I think that they don't like
the fact that we have a lot of fun.
That and the Dancing in the
moonlight thing. It's a shame
really cos to us that's what life's
about-About not taking things too
seriously. At the end of the day we
do the same job as every other
band-there's nothing we do really
any different from day to day, only
we have more of a laugh with it
probably.
Does it not bother you though?
You can't let it. You just have to
get on with it. Everyone's entitled
to their opinion so there's nothing
you can do to change their opin-
ion. If they started shooting us
then....you know sticks and
stones etc.
Are there any bands that you've
ever really hated?
Not really because I understand
the fact that everyone's trying to
make music first and foremost
and to therefore make a living and
everyone's entitled to do that. I
mean obviously the pop thing's
annoying but again it's just mar-
keting people. I think as soon as
the industry machine takes over
too much and it becomes too
apparent that you're not listening
to someone's music any more but
that you're listening to a corpora-
tion's idea of what music is, then
music becomes shallow and soul-
less but we get accused of that
and I think that's the only thing
that upsets us, because we do
have a lot of integrity and we
believe in the music and likewise
we do make throwaway pop from
time to time.
Does it not bother you though
that your most popular song is
basically a cover and not your
own?
No not at all. I mean the
Beatles did Roll Over Beethoven,
the stones played loads of covers
too. We've not done a faithful ver-
sion of the song we've bought it
up to date and made it more
interesting.
Why did you play at the
jubilee. Are you pro-monarchy?
The jubilee thing was probably
shown to the whole of the com-
monwealth and probably a billion

Britain's most

viewers so we wanted to do it on
that basis. And it was a really
great day. We do things which
aren't perhaps cool but by doing
that day we had one of the days
of our lives and it's something I'll
never forget. It wasn't about the
cause. I don't want to decapitate
the monarchy but I think if some
old bint's been head of state of
this country for god knows how
long, if she can't have a party and
make a big deal out of it then it
seems a shame.
What would make Toploader split
up?
If someone fucked someone
else's girlfriend or wife then that
might do it. We get on pretty well.
We fight when we're in the cre-
ative process but I think that's
healthy. When we go on tour it's
very rare that we have arguments.
Do you ever see older bands like
Guns 'n Roses and the Stones
and think that it's about time
that they actually call it a day?
Well I used to but I can under-
stand now why they carry on
doing it. The thought of going
back to all our old jobs is not that
appealing. So yeah, I can com-
pletely understand why, say, The
Cure are still going on.

Still, it's hard to totally loathe
them - after all don't we all get
a bit annoying from time to
time when we're drunk?
Of course, you want to know
about the record, I probably
digresss too much. Sorry chum
- there isn't much to say. It's a
single taken from the Comfort
In Sound LP. It's a scientifically-
proven 3:12 long. The song-
writing, arrangement and pro-
duction are up to the usual high
Feeder standard. And yes: you
will find your feet a-tappin' just
a little bit. But as a band, it
seems Feeder really have noth-
ing to say anymore. So neither!
do I.

Suede - Positivity
Jess]
It's hard to tell if anyone still
remembers Suede, the Third
Band of Britpop. They weren't
as catchy as Blur, or as noisy as
Oasis. But you always suspect-
ed that if anyone really cared
about their songs, it was
Suede. On the basis of this
record, that's still the case.
One of the most appealing
things about them was Brett
Anderson's vocals; at once
sneering and fragile, humble,
even. That's true here, in cou-
plets like "Your smile is your
credit card / Your currency is
your love." Ambivalent lyrics,
delicately sung - suggesting a
man balancing between the
good life he's won but trying to
hold on to some youthful vitriol
at the same time.
It's not a sentiment that most
of the kids will get, and neither
will they appreciate this song: a
leisurely autumn stroll around a
leafy North London park, ratherj
than the edgy Soho strut of
older Suede classics like
Filmstar. But why should the|
kids have all the fun?
