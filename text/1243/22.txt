You can write some rambling rubbish here.
If that tickled your fancy, write a crossword and your waffle will be
printed. No skill is needed, as I've ably demonstrated above, and
you will be the proud owner of a name inducing a bigger cringe
each time you hear it, until you develop a permanent deformity and
emigrate, leaving the message "You can write some rambling rub-
bish here...". This week's winner is Andrew Rose, Physics II who
gets everlasting glory and the chance to win something very expen-
sive. If this appeals, bring your answers to the office (Beit Quad
West basement) or send them to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk. Ta-ta for
now. MH
