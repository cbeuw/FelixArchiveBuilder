And Alex Said...
Fresh! Aaah! Wake up in the
morning in those crisp, clean
sheets, open the window and
breathe in a lungful of fresh
country air. Brush your teeth
with that minty toothpaste, full
of freshness. Freshen up with a
nice shower. Refresh yourself
with a glass of orange juice and
some toast. Fresh! Yes! Fresh is
clean and sweet-smelling and
full of energy and lovely.
Something of a mystery, then,
why new university students are
called "Freshers". If there were a
group of people less clean and
sweet-smelling than students, I
really wouldn't want them near
me while I was trying to eat.
By now most freshers should
have realised why they don't
show you round halls of resi-
dence on university open days.
Going to university is great, but
for all that new-found independ-
ence, you've got to sacrifice a
few things. Things like basic
hygiene, for instance. Decent
cooking, for another. Furniture
manufactured since 1978.
At home, you can leave crock-
ery near the sink and, in a few
hours, it's gone. If you want a
cup of coffee,
get a mug out
of the cup-
board. Grab a
spoon from the
drawer. Make it. Simple. Nice.
At university, if you want a cup
of coffee, run your mug under the
tap and scrape the congealed
stuff from the spoon. Put the
dirty, wet spoon in the coffee jar
and then the sugar jar, and then
wonder why all your coffee gran-
ules have turned into one huge,
jar-sized mass, and why your
Filth!
sugar has brown lumps in it.
You can just about put up with
that for your year in halls. But in
your second year it gets worse.
In your own flat, at least now you
know whose hair that is in the
shower, but if you leave it there
for 24 hours, it doesn't magically
go away - somebody has got to
clean it up.
Probably you.
Students
often go into
their second
year and forget that cleaning is
something that needs to be done
more than once every six weeks.
When it gets to this stage, you
can forget about cleaning the
bathroom with a cloth - you'll
need a chisel.
It's a lot simpler to just clean
up more regularly. But try telling
that to your fellow students. You
could draw up a rota, but you
know even before you write it
that they will read it as avidly as
the latest update to your
Barclaycard Terms and
Conditions, and with about as
much enthusiasm as, well,
cleaning the toilet. And if you're
lucky, it will be kept to just as
accurately as a typical bus
timetable, i.e. with absolutely no
correlation whatsoever between
who's supposed to be doing the
cleaning, and who's there with a
scrubbing brush.
No, the only sensible solution
is just to live with it. Brace your-
self, lower your standards and
get on with it. Sit down in your
rickety wooden chair, open wide
and swallow a mouthful of what-
ever is parasite of the day. It's
good for the immune system.

You could say my degree
isn't relevant for a career
in Investment Banking,
or you could find
out the truth.
