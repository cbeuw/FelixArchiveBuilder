Hockey Banter!
IC Ladies I - 3

The medics turned out expecting
to destroy the IC girls. How wrong
they were.
The new season brought a num-
ber of exciting new freshers; not
only pretty capable on the pitch,
but also handy in the bar

We rocked up to Fortress
Harlington two and a half hours
early for the game. For the major-
ity of hockey players this would
mean practice time. Not for the
Imperial Cavaliers. We bought the
lOp star and a bottle of sherry.
After certain members of the
team made sure some of their rel-
atives got back to China okay, a
match between Ladies 2nds and
the Medics was thoroughly enjoy-
able.
As ever the senior pros deliv-
ered a solid performance as we all
played shit: the standard set by
The game saw the IC ladies
destroy the medics. Helene's first
goal tore apart the defence, strik-
ing a perfect shot into the top right
hand corner.
The second goal came from an
old favourite - Lady P (Helen). The
superb short corner routine,
rehearsed to perfection, confused
the pants off the opposition...
Gazbox early on when he conced-
ed a dribbler after 10 minutes...
The captain (villager) took time
to consider the options for reviv-
ing the situation and in a tactical-
ly astute manner proposed an all-
out attack strategy which would
pay dividends later on. However
by half time Kings were still 1-0
up on us.
After the half time munch on
oranges, the Cavaliers were fired
up and....
Thankfully Essex "Ball-Monkey"
Helene - the super fresher -
struck again in the dying moments
of the game to seal the over-
whelming IC ladies victory and
sent the medics home wondering
what went wrong.
What more can we say? Attack
skills. Rock solid defence. One
hundred percent wins. Clean
sheets for the season...
Wide Boy dummied the ball and
scored with a little help from
Boyzone!
Legend status is never reached
without a little action from the old
boys and soon enough the
Geography Teacher, whilst shark-
ing the hell out of some side-line
bitch, upset the opposition's
defence and a further beauty was
sneaked past into their goal! To
be fair, though, it does have to be
admitted that they were all unfor-
tunates...
All in all it was a legendary per-
formance from legendary players
comprising a legendary team in a
legendary way.
