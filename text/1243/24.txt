First game of the season really
had to be a friendly. Firsts versus
seconds has always been a clas-
sic, with the seconds always up
for it. Game started and the sec-
onds went straight in, passing it
about nicely. We came back and
took control of the game. We
looked good going forward creat-
ing some pretty good chances but
for all our efforts, they had Carlos
in goal making some good saves.
Freshers that came in looked good
on both sides. Hendrik was solid
at the back, Nathan sharp up front
and Leigh tricky down the right.
Managed to score after all, with
Anis moving well on the left, pass-
ing to Nick, who took on one of
their defenders and finished it
nicely. Then, the seconds had a
couple of chances and managed
IC VI - 9
RSM II - 2
Despite RSM taking an unexpect-
ed and undeserved lead the
mighty 6th machine rolled on.
Impressive freshers Ed and Stuart
netted after RSM scored from a
corner, as well as the skillful
Richard "Richard" Jones. 3 - 1 to
IC at half time. Then Sagi and
Chris 'proceeded' to make it 7 - 1
before Tom Andrew decided to
generously award RSM a penalty:
never let it be said the he isn't
generous. It was unfair on both
the new goalkeeper Pete and the
to hit the bar once. Coming on in
the second half, everyone looked
better. We were in complete con-
trol of the game and that didn't
take long to show. About half way
through the second half, we
scored again. Same slick passing
outside the box, hiding the ball,
scoring with a brilliant finish to
the top corner.
Soon after that we scored again,
sweet finish from Anis, curling it
past the keeper. We pretty much
stayed in control of the game and
missed a couple more chances to
score and that's how the game fin-
ished. Always good to start with a
win when looking forward to a
season of high expectations.
centre-back Morgan who both
had assured debuts. RSM briefly
enjoyed a spell of possession
before parity was restored by the
guile of Dimas and Oz. After that
the siege began as a desperate
RSM tried not to concede ten.
Bring on the fifths....
