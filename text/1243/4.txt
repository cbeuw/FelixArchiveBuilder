IC Radio
Just in case you missed it, our
outside broadcast from the
Queen's Tower at Freshers' Fair
was a big success. Thanks to
everyone involved, especially Jess
for her unique role in Ben and
Jerry's truly ingenious competi-
tion! Thanks also to everyone who
came to see us, even if it was only
to grab a free CD - we hope to see
you all again soon.
Free beer and biscuits
Free beer? Free biscuits? Tours of
our studios? Great music? And
the chance to pick the brains of IC
Radio's finest while we're not run-
ning around like headless chick-
ens doing an outside broadcast?
Mmm, that sounds like our
famous Freshers' event to me. Yes
indeed, "Free Beer and Biscuits
2002" will be held this Tuesday,
the 15th, from 8pm. Just find
your way to the west wing of Beit
Quad, and follow the signs. It's
the ideal chance to take a look
around our new facilities, find out
what we have to offer as an ICU
society, and of course enjoy a pint
or two.
Get involved
Any Imperial student can become
a member of IC Radio for the
ridiculously low, bargain-base-
ment price of £8 for the entire
year. For your £8, we'll give you
the chance to present your own
weekly radio show, review the
best new releases before they hit
the shops, and take part in
College news, production, promo-
tions, technical stuff, the website,
running the station, and just
about anything else radio-related
that you can think of. "Free Beer
and Biscuits" is a great opportuni-
ty to join up and start getting
involved with your radio station,
so come along.
