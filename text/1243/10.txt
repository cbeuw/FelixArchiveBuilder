Just Jack
P a r a d i s e
Those of you who like The Streets
and Faithless may like this album.
Jack Allsopp, a north Londoner,
along with his six compatriots,
has made a pretty good debut
album. It starts off positive with
the song Let's Get Really Honest,
using a sample from I'm Not In
Love (1995). My initial thought
was "The Beatles, no... The
Avalanches, no... Air". It was
none of them but it was good.
The following tune Paradise real-
ly sets the theme for the album
Rhianna
G e t O n
Get On is the mature, polished,
slick and sassy debut from
Leeds-born Rhianna. Opening
with the soulful single Oh Baby,
she gets down, dirty and truly
funky with this stunner of a
track, which sweats optimism
and avoids unwanted lyrical
fussing, every word adding
another element of cadence. The
with Jack Allsopp, like Mike
Skinner, "speaking poetry", some
may say MC-ing, but I think not.
A very upbeat tune, the album
sounds promising so far. The next
tune is deeper, darker, with more
punch, Jack sounding like Maxi
Jazz and saying his lyrics to a
nice bit of music. The middle of
the album remains deep, meticu-
lous, easily fading into the back-
ground, a slow burner of an
album, and Sammy D features on
Eye To Eye. Contradictions is next
up, a paceier tune, funky guitar,
but now with similarities to Ian
Brown with the lack of effort in
the vocals.
The lack of effort in the vocals
was just for a single tune though
as Snapshot memories progress-
es sounding more like Air, with
the tune playing with a lot of elec-
tric synthesisers and samples.
7r/p/e Tone Eyes is faster, being
drum and bass, melodic but
gloomy, not as upbeat as earlier.
second single Word Love echoes
all the great soul sisters of note,
e.g. Beverley Knight and Aretha
Franklin with its high-pitched
vocals and seventies backing
rhythm. "Sometimes the word
love/ Just ain't good enough/To
describe this I feel for you".
Likewise, Damn is a jazzy, sassy,
uptempo, soulful delight, about
newly found singledom (go
Rhianna!) with a hint of RnB
and the Stevie Wonder cover, /
Love Every Little Thing About
You does justice to the original.
Another highlight, is the jazz-
funk pop-masterpiece of Moon is
Blue, which brings the vibe
down with a suitably understat-
ed sexiness and cut-to-pieces
beat. Unfortunately, the album
does have its duff tracks, in the
shape of the overtly socially-
conscious Runaway, and the dis-
gustingly soppy Romeo and
Juliet. (As you've learnt before,
3/5
The album rounds off with a slow-
er tune Ain't Too Sad, nothing
that will have you singing praises
but a thoughtful song non the
less. Although a well thought
album with stimulating areas, an
album that none the less sounds
like it bears heavily on other cre-
ative influences that are the origi-
nal pioneers of this sound.

4/5
this writer has a thing against
soppy pieces of music, having
not needed them in a long, long
time. She is, as we speak, per-
fectly single. No supplementary
reasons needed to explain why
she enjoys drinking and bitching
about being single with best
mate).
It's hard to believe Rhianna is
only nineteen, having produced
such an accomplished debut
album. I sincerely hope that she
keeps up the good work, for pro-
ducing one of the best pop
albums of the year, and that she
has the efficacy to turn it into an
entertaining live show - she is
performing on tour with Beverley
Knight in December.
This album deserves to do
well on a mainstream level and
is a stylish effort deserving of
mass recognition. Go and buy it
now!

Singles
McAlmont and Butler - Bring It
Back
The maestro has his turn, with
the acoustic squiggles, maraca
shakes and gospel intro. This pro-
vides the perfect backdrop for
David McAlmont's breathy, stun-
ning and rich vocals to take the
simple, yet effective lyrics to the
highest peaks showing the band
as velvety, romantic, loving, pure
soul in the days of electronica
and alternative. Who cares if it
sounds old fashioned in most of
the songs? I don't. Likeable to
anyone and everyone, accessible,
well-crafted, melodic and fun,
this is how pop should be.
5/5

Big-Brovaz - Nu Flow
This is the South London
garage/rnb group's first single. It's
an encouraging debut which has
a circus feel to it while still main-
taining the urban beats. Lyrically
they're talking about how they're
gonna take over the music indus-
try, introduce themselves and
dissing the haterz. Usual subject
matter. Nonetheless catchy.
