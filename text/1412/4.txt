No progress for
Palestinian student
With a month of term passed already,
and little progress being made by the
International Office, it is looking high-
ly unlikely that Zohair Abu Shaban, the
Palestinian student who was denied
passage out of Gaza, will be taking up
his place to do an Electrical Engineer-
ing masters at Imperial.
When felix first published this story on
the 10th of October, a buzz of activity
within the student body and the Col-
lege seemed to provide a little bit of
hope for a solution to his predicament.
Members of IslamicSoc were organis-
ing together, by email, to formulate an
action plan that included circulating a
petition around the student body and
distributing leaflets to raise awareness.
However this was nipped in the bud by
Nida Harwood, Islamic Society VP, in
favour of waiting “to see what the uni-
versity does”. This delay in action oc-
cured after lengthy consultation with
Deputy President Education and Wel-
fare Hannah Theodorou.
Felix spoke to the International Of-
fice this week in an effort to discover
whether waiting for College’s lead was
an intelligent action plan. The Inter-
national Office declined to provide
any specific information on his case.
Dr Piers Baker, Director of the Inter-
national Office said “it’s not under our
Kadhim Shubber
Deputy Editor
control and so it’s not appropriate for
me to comment on this specific case”.
Given the notable absence of Zohair
Abu-Shaban at Imperial, it is clear that
the College has been unable to make
any progress.
It would appear that Zohair Abu-
Shaban will have to put off his dreams
for at least another year.
The College’s Honorary Graduates
Afonso Campos invites you to question the true meaning of being an Honorary Graduate or Fellow as
he takes a look at the past recipients of this award
H
onorary degrees have
been offered since the
middle ages to figures
that a university sup-
posedly deems worthy
enough, or has somehow ruled judge-
ment that they have contributed sig-
nificant amounts to either society as
a whole or a field of academic or non-
academic life.
As far as records go, Imperial has
been offering either Honorary Doctor-
ates or Fellowships of the College since
1932.
While a lot of those awarded their
honours have, without a shadow of
a doubt been leaders in their respec-
tive fields and instigators of change
and advancement of society, questions
may be raised about the reasoning
behind some of these doctorates and
fellowships.
We have seen Imperial award them
to great minds such as Dennis Gabor,
Nobel Laureate and founder of Holog-
raphy, and Dame Carol Black, Presi-
dent of the Royal College of Physicians,
member of the GMC and President of
the British Lung Foundation, amongst
other insurmountable posts.
As Lord Kerr elegantly put it is dur-
ing this year’s Graduation Ceremony,
some of the recipients have been the
ones “honouring us” by accepting our
offer.
It is understandable that universi-
ties must do what they can in order
to raise their profiles globally and in-
crease sources of donation. It is not
understandable however that some of
the people to whom the College con-
fers what is by many considered to be
the apogee of qualifications to person-
alities who are just plain wealthy. Our
university is a world leader in scientific
research and it is almost expected that
all who are graced with these ‘prizes’
be those who have made significant
difference to the fields which Imperial
has deeply been involved in since its
founding.
By artificially widening their alumni
base to the über-rich, College is more
likely than not hoping to reap some fi-
nancial benefits in the form of future
donations from these graduates, de-
spite their links to this institution be-
ing absolutely minimal if existent at all.
A high number of philanthropists and
industry magnates such Ratan Tata,
chairman of the Tata Group or Mrs
Lily Safra, a born-rich socialite have
been awarded these Imperial honours.
It leaves one to ponder if academia has
become so competitive for funding
that institutions are almost having to
throw away their pride (and sometimes
shame) in an attempt to stay ahead of
the money-raising game.
Institutions of higher education are
becoming quite similar to places such
as Hollywood – trying to secure stars
and celebrities in an attempt to boost
future earnings.
The model is used by many indus-
tries, but it somehow spoils the pu-
rity of academia and demeans the
past Honorary Graduates and Fellows
whom despite not being extravagantly
rich, have truly and whole-heartedly
deserved what they have been given.
While in some ways treating learn-
ing institutions like corporations can
be healthy, it is not the way forward
for increasing endowments. If Impe-
rial is ever going to come even close to
matching Harvard or Yale’s financial
success, it must instil in its students an
incredible sense of pride and belonging
to their alma mater.

Posh enough to wash?

odic, washing of attire is necessary.
Unfortunately Imperial College has
deemed it appropriate to milk the stu-
dent cash cow. As of present the added
cost to the student budget for the com-
pulsory task of washing your garments
within residencies comes to a total of
£3. The price of a wash is £2, while the
cost for one dry cycle is £1, indeed with
some students stating that 2 dry cycles
are needed to dry their clothes.
This years prices are an increase
upon last years, where a wash cost
£1.50, a dry cycle 50 pence and was
free the year before that. Although the
washing machines are run by a third
part company, the increasing cost of
this basic necessity has caused signifi-
cant anger and resentment amongst
students in halls.
