The Paragon crisis three weeks later
Almost a month after the start of term,
1st year students are still stuck at Para-
gon Hall In Brentford. As the main
strategy being used by College is wait-
ing for other students in Imperial halls
to drop out, the 5 undergraduate stu-
dents now living together at Paragon
are left in limbo and facing an uncer-
tain future.
Although listed as “our award win-
ning student accommodation” on the
Thames Valley University website, felix
has been informed that Paragon is ac-
tually an inter-collegiate hall. Original-
ly 23 students were destined to begin
university this TVU/intercollegiate hall
much removed from the student popu-
lace. From this group, 5 students failed
to fill their place at Imperial. Hannah
Theodorou, Deputy President Educa-
tion and Welfare, and Head of Accom-
modation Shireen Brown, greeted the
students that did arrive. They spoke
to parents and tried to assuage their
worries about their accommodation.
As a small recompense the students
were given free mingle tickets as well
as a minibus back from the event. They
have also been participating in other
halls events such as the Southside boat
party and the Southwell trip to Brug-
es. Attempts to integrate the 1st year
students with post-graduates at Clay-
ponds were not received well. 32 inch
HD-TVs were installed in the fresher’s
kitchens also.

felix speaks to Paragon freshers who have been moved to other halls, and those who have been left behind
How did you end up at Paragon?
Fabrice Clark
The students are paying around £113
a week for a single, ensuite room in
Paragon. The students were presented
with a list of possible rooms in other
halls and were invited to choose which
they preferred. The recipients of the
rooms were chosen by random ballot.
Since the beginning of term, all of the
female students at Paragon and 13 of
the male students have been relocated
to Piccadilly Court, Orient, Southwell,
Pembridge, Southside and Wilson.
The remaining students are on the
waiting list for rooms in Imperial halls
but unless students drop out, there
won’t be any openings. Hannah Theo-
dorou said “the students are a priority
on the waiting lists for vacancies”. Iron-
ically, although 1st year students are
hoping to be moved out of Paragon,
postgraduates may soon be moving in.
In the mean time, Fabrice Clarke
and the other students have only the
cold comfort of knowing that the hour
commute each day is good training for
2nd year.

Have college handled this well?
Did you enjoy your time there?
Fabrice Clarke is a 1st year
electrical engineer student who is
still living at Paragon Hall.
“The College should warn us in
advance that if we don’t have offers
instead of letting us find out days
before the start of term. ”
How did you end up at Paragon?

Callum Macbeth-seath is a 1st
year electrical engineer student who
now lives in Piccadillly Court.
“The College should make less offers
next year.”
Adam Cutmore is a 1st year
computing student who now lives in
Keogh Hall.
“We should be kept up-to-date more
about the accommodation process”
I originally applied for South Kensing-
ton halls and I was given an offer. I
wasn’t told about the 7-day reply limit
and so when I came back from holiday
I realised that it had been withdrawn.
It was only days before the Mingle that
I was offered a room at Paragon.
It was a strain travelling in the morning
but all the students at Paragon got on
really well together. We made friends
with each other easily and we got to go
to other halls events. I didn’t meet any
TVU students, we had our own floor
so we were kind of sectioned off.
When we moved in the Head of Ac-
commodation spoke to us all and ex-
plained the situation, which was good
but Hannah Theorodou has been re-
ally helpful. She made sure we were
able to go to the Mingle and kept us
informed about what was going on.
I missed the accommodation deadline
because I was waiting for a re-mark.
College didn’t tell me that I didn’t have
a room until near the end of Septem-
ber. I looked for a flat and I put a de-
posit down before I was offered Para-
gon, so I lost the deposit.
Are you enjoying your time there?
Originally it was quite fun, there were
20 of us and we were quite close. Now
there’s only 5 of us left and the atmos-
phere is much different, we’re just sort
of waiting around now. It takes around
an hour to get into college which is a
big inconvenience.
Have college handled this well?
They went to a lot of trouble to keep
us happy, giving us free tickets to the
Mingle and other stuff. It felt like we
were being pressured to move out of
Paragon. They allowed us to join in
events with other halls, although go-
ing to Clayponds was a bit weird.
Basically, I didn’t get my application
in on time because I hadn’t decided
whether or not to live at home. I took
the offer of a room at Paragon because
I was hoping to be moved to another
hall. I’m pretty happy now that I’m liv-
ing in Southside.
Did you enjoy your time there?
It was a really nice hall, it’s only two
years old. I had a single, ensuite room
which was great but it wasn’t worth the
distance from campus. We were all re-
ally desperate to move into Imperial
halls and we were all very aware how
temporary it was.
Have college handled this well?
Hannah Theodorou was really help-
ful, she set up a meeting so that we
could choose which rooms we want-
ed to be moved for. I think the Col-
lege have done a good job but I think
there is a problem with the applica-
tion process, we need more info.
