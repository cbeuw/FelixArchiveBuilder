And hello. This week’s crossword, for
all those of you who care, is a themed
one, with a large number of the clues
referencing the title in one way or an-
other. Apologies for associated unim-
aginative clueing.
The theme has been taking a lot of
time out of the schedules of a lot of
people this past month, and if you
want to see the result of the collective
labours, be in the Union Concert Hall
this Thursday, Friday or Saturday at
19:00.

IC win the Heineken 10’s, with 7 people
For pre-pre season, seven brave play-
ers made there way to Ealing Common
to shown the guys at Heineken what
was what. Imperial arriving late, un-
der prepared and with only seven men
were not phased. Rocking up to bust a
move on the tournament, with a 3 man
disadvantage, IC started by scoring
several tries. They carried this game
plan forward into the rest of the game.
It proved effective, seeing as scoring
more points than your opposition can
only help things. The gamble paid off.
Immeadiately after putting away
seven tries in the first game, IC had to
play London Scottish. Nick Johnstone
got himself back together after a quick
chunder in the hedge and got back into
the action. The boys were feeling bad,
but after some smash and grab action
form the three man back line of Tom
Carol, Mark the Sambuca Saleme and
Chris Johnstone, things had got back
under way. The try count increased
and also saw IC keep a clean sheet.
Malcolm Sim scored his first try which
was well deserved after a huge work
rate, the likes of which would make any
small child cry.
This monster effort saw the boys
achieve a place in the final. Here they
would face an old foe, not the medical
scum that they are use to, but IC Old
Boys. Knowing this would be tough,
match preparation was vital. Alex
Johnstone chinned a protein shake and
some high tech jungle juice to give him
the edge. His tactics worked bringing
him back to his old form. Having come
off the back of a disappointing season,
where he only scored 150 points, he
was keen to prove a point. Despite his

This is one fearsome, penetrating bitch.
And not in a good way.
After much anticipation Imperial Col-
lege Gaelic Football Club finally took
the field at our new pitch in Harlington
in the first match of the season against
University of Bedfordshire. Having
only entered into the BUCS competi-
tion this year for the first time, both
teams were in unfamiliar territory,
both however were determined to get
off to a successful start. Bedford ac-
quitted themselves better in the open-
ing minutes making full use of their
outrageously long warm up having ar-
rived an hour and a half early for the
game. The IC defence was opened up
all too easily and the opposition were
rewarded with two soft goals in the
early exchanges.
Seemingly this handed the impetus
to IC and the team shook themselves
into action through the midfield duo
of Finian McCann and Edward O’Hare
who remained exemplary for the rest
of the match. With the tactical switch
of Jamie Sanders into the full back line
the tide started to turn. Time and again
IC repelled the Bedford attack and be-
gan making inroads themselves. Frank
O’Neill opened our account, calmly
turning to shoot over the bar from
middle distance. O’Neill again got on
the scoresheet minutes later with a
well taken goal after some superb field-
ing by O’Hare who set the West Bel-
fast man up on the right flank. Further
points from McCann and a speculative
long range effort from Andrew Lavery
saw IC play the more attractive football
of the half, being much more clinical in
their passing and finishing, though but
still suffering from the soft goals con-
ceded earlier. Half time score 1-03 to
2-05. (Bedford leading by five points.)
The second half saw more of battling
from both teams. A lack of fitness was
evident as both teams fatigued and the
moments of champagne football in the
first half were not to be seen again.
Bedford players were cynical in their
tackles and ironically their only re-
ward was in injuring their centre half
back who dislocated his shoulder and
was subbed off. The prick. Over the
next thirty minutes the match was to
be won and lost in the diamond region
around midfield. Paddy the-brick-
wall Heugh in centre half forward was
steadfast for the whole game expertly
catching several high balls and allow-
ing the defensive partnership of Phil
Jakeman and Donnacha Kirk to clear
their lines. Some frenetic attacking
from both teams saw the full backs at
either end under periods of intense
pressure, only the fine keeping from
Stan Sikorski denied Bedford all but
one of the further goals they were op-
timistically looking for, while at the
other end the opposition keeper under
pressure from O’Neill and Lavery was
forced into conceding a penalty which
O’Neill stuck in the net. Ten minutes
left and all was to play for. Mattie Wilks
offered many options to the IC attack
in the closing quarter but the team
failed to convert their chances with
the same finesse as earlier in the game,
only managing another point through
the left boot of Edward O’Hare. Full
time score 2-04 to 3-07.
Imperial lost out this time but there
were many positives to be taken from
the game and the team eagerly look
forward to their next match against
Oxford this Sunday and the chance to
revenge themselves for last year’s chal-
lenge match result. Training continues
in Hyde Park Wednesday and Friday
afternoons and if anyone is interested
in joining or finding out more, email

like to thank Sport Imperial and it’s
staff for their great support of and in-
vestment in the club in this its maiden
season.

IC 4s V IC 5s has become the stuff
of legends. The stats speak for them-
selves, from IC4s point of view: Played
6, Lost 6, not a single point scraped
from this epic derby. For this reason
the 4s approached this game with
caution.
The 4s were already missing Chris
Noone who decided to miss the game
to pursue his 2 month heterosexual run
and the infamous Dutch U21 Wayne
Van Der Roo has still not turned up
since fresher’s fair. The game was al-
ways going to be fiercely contested
with the reputation as the Wednesday
ULU flagship team up for grabs. Cap-
tain Jeremy “J-Lo” Lovett rallied the
team aided by his trusty sidekick Gui
with some broken English, some about
football, most about nothing. What did
come from the team talk was a strong
start with Marcus and Mike at centre
half producing the kind of big tackle
that even Claude Makelele would be
proud of. The game ebbed and flowed
with both teams sharing possession
for the first half. The 5s struggled to
contain Inty and James Long upfront,
but were bailed out by their man of the
match, the ref. Gui rounded the keeper
only to be given offside which resulted
in much flamboyant preying gestures
and finger waving as Gui tried to vent
his fury with the referee. The 5s cap-
tain Ron then floored Jeremy with a
tackle that those fellas with the odd
shaped balls would be proud of only to
be let off without a caution. The in-
justice drove the 4s on and the reward
came with what can only be described
as a stone-wall , 100% definite penalty
which Inty neatly slotted away to give
the 4s a well deserved lead going into
the break.
The 4s recently have lacked the abil-
ity to kill a game off but that is exactly
what was needed for the second half.
lack of confidence, he faced his fears
and scored the winning try. This mon-
umental effort will no doubt fuel the
ego of the team for years to come.
Captain James Pettit collected the sil-
ver wear on behalf of IC which will be
the first of many more to come. Coach
Joe Brown said “The lads put in a mas-
sive effort today. To come here and put
in a performance like this is unreal.
They didn’t let the 3 man disadvantage
get to them. I’d like to thank every-
one that made this possible, including
Hugh Dingleberry, who sadly couldn’t
be here today.”
Special mention must go to Mark
Saleme who scored four tries through-
out the day. Its good to see him getting
back to his old ways, having to relearn
the game of rugby, after the unfortu-
nate concussion he suffered two years
ago.
The swap of Captain Jeremy for con-
tinental Jeremy worked a treat and the
team took on a more attacking stance.
It was Jeremy who in fact bagged the
second goal, riffling home a shot from
within the penalty area to give the 4s
a much needed cushion. The third
came as Matty Spliff put in a bold chal-
lenge to get on the end of a dangerous
Alex Childs through ball which then
fell for James Long to clinically slot
home. The rest of the game was a for-
mality with the 4s controlling posses-
sion and the final whistle brought ju-
bilant celebrations and Captain Jeremy
clearly Lov-d-ett.
At the end of the day the real win-
ner was as the cliché suggests, football.
Both teams look strong and should
have plenty of success in ULU 1 against
other less physically attractive teams.
The football club is open to anyone
wanting to be part of the ongoing suc-
cess story which is IC Football and
newcomers are more than welcome to

ICURFC 1st XV travelled to Bristol
a week ago on Wednesday to play the
University of West England in the first
game of the season. With promotion
to South Premiership B the boys were
anxious yet excited to discover the
standard of teams they will be facing.
The day got off to a rocky start with
the coach failing to show up resulting
in two players having to drive minibus-
es. Arriving late, the team had just 45
minutes on the pitch to warm up and
shake off the long drive.
Imperial went out all guns blazing,
putting a lot of pressure on the UWE
attack and forcing some crucial errors.
After an intense first ten minutes it be-
came clear that this was a game Impe-
rial were capable of winning.
However, after conceding two sloppy
penalties within kicking range UWE
went 6-0 up. Imperial kept a clear
head and stuck to their game plan.
There were some great line breaks in
the centres however IC struggled to
turn territory into points. UWE went
on to score two tries making the half
time score 20-0.
After some stern words from the
captain and coach, Imperial went into
the second half determined to turn the
deficit. After some well structured for-
ward play, fresher fly-half David Bowe
spotted a gap on the blind side. Tom
Carroll ran a good angle and went fly-
ing through a gap, catching the UWE
defence off guard. Carroll went on to
brush off the full back scoring Impe-
rials first try of the season. Alexander
Johnstone converted the try with an
excellent kick from the touchline mak-
ing the score 20-7.
IC carried on battling in the sec-
ond half, producing some great rugby.
However it was not to be their day.
UWE managed to get deep into the IC
half and made use of their heavy pack
with several pick and goes. Eventually,
they wore down the IC defence and
managed to push over a try making the
score 27-7. Things were not looking
good for Imperial and with UWE scor-
ing a fourth try a comeback seemed
out of their grasp.
In the last few minutes, Imperial
scored a consolation try with Joe Har-
ris getting his first points for the 1st
XV. The final score was 32-12 to UWE.
Man of the match was awarded to Tom
Carroll for his penetrative running and
solid defence. A special mention goes
to freshers Charlie Esberger, David
Bowe, Sam Coe and Alex Cardyn for
their impressive debuts.
A disappointing result to start the
new season, but there are signs of great
things to come. This will hopefully
improve for next week’s game against
Oxford Brookes.
