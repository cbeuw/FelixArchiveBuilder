Stuff IC Students Like!? :)

Ravi is a re-app, he has re-app stuff to
do. Little freshers to attend to, so hello
if you’re one of them! It wouldn’t be a
problem, but his column is all empty.
Now I’m getting scared, because I
don’t know what to say. I’m getting
rather worried, the end of the page is
far away.
If only I could go back and just start
playing with my wool, life is a lot easier
when felix is nice and full.
I could try and write a lot of words,
telling you felix is great, but I don’t
have much to say on that, its really
quite a state of late!
But this week is much better. I chal-
lenge you, the reader, find a mistake in
thisweeks felix.Ifyouwouldrathernot,
check out the lovely pictures below.
5. Discount:
People like free stuff. Students like
free stuff even more. Students at
Imperial College London appreciate
a good bargain, and gain immense
satisfaction when they get discount,
and the real world doesn’t. Some
would say it’s not worth shopping
somewhere if there’s no student dis-
count available. We at felix agree. In
fact IC students have enjoyed student
discount even more as of late. Why?
Well it’s because ICU as of this year
has disaffiliated from the NUS.
Now with most stores advertising
discount for NUS card holders, IC
students enjoy it when their standard
issue student ID is accepted. Believe
me when we say no where we have
been has ever refused the IC student
card for discount. This includes cin-
emas, restaurants, clothing stores,
video game stores, HMV, Zavi and
Pc World amongst others. Now if
only our tuitions fees had student
discount

This weeks winner. Team Joseph Gobbels. Again! Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
Congratulations to this week’s win-
ner, Team Joseph Gobbels. We hon-
estly thought that this picture was too
hard to make fun off, but hey Team
JB came through again. We apologise
to our dedicated competitors for the
late uploading of the picture to our
website. Well done to the observant
of you who still managed to submit
an entry. This week I loved the way
the Dirty Sanchez boys are rocking
out with their instruments.
Drink with me, I’m Snaky B

This week’s image is of the tiny coffee
van that drove into the quad dispens-
ing free coffee. It was very nice, and we
liked the price. We’re not really sure
what you can do with this one, but
that’s why we outsource to you.

S
nakey B has been quite un-
healthy in the last few weeks.
I’ve been drinking snakebites
all day and eating nothing
but butter.
To try and correct my heart-stopping
lifestyle I’m following in the footsteps
of the most musically talented Liv-
erpuddlian of the last century; that’s
right, The Beatles were crap.
Yeh, I’m Sporty Spice y’all! You might
think that my music career is over, but
do you know that I toured Canada this
year? And also that I’m writing songs
for my 5th album?
It doesn’t matter that it will be re-
cycled pop trash that Britney Spears
didn’t deem good enough for her, what
matters is that I’m still a quasi-celebri-
ty. I’m not even Z-list.
In other Wikipedia sourced facts I
have co-written the most UK number
one singles of any female artist. Snakey
B knows how to use a computer, I bet
you think that you need thumbs and
such for access to the inter-webz but
all you really need is to be as ubiqui-
tous as me, Snaky B. Yes... run to your
dictionaries!
When you figure out what that big
word means, use it in every sentence!
Who will I be next week? Probably
someone cooler. Snakey B out. Peace
Please sir. May I have some discount? I’m a student... Alright then.

Felix is knitting himself a scarf, the purple compliments his eyes.
Knit Soc won’t stitch you up
T
his year, felix is going to
have a far more varied and
hopefully relevant clubs
and societies page. In a
couple of weeks (with the
help of DPCS Lily Topham & Rachel
D’oliveiro) we’ll be bringing you a
“What’s on” section that’s a guide to all
of the events happening through the
coming week.
We will also be looking for events to
cover and weekly meetings to attend,
in an attempt to find the weirdest and
most wonderful activities happen-
ing on campus. For this to happen,
we need clubs to get in contact with
details of up-coming events for us to
attend (if these include refreshments
that will keep me doubly happy!). Par-
ticularly interesting will be events that
provide good photo opportunities, and
new skills for Felix to learn.
At 4 pm felix received a phone call: Would anyone like to come and visit the first Knit
Soc meeting of term? By 6pm I was knitting, but not without a lot of sweat and tears.

F
rom the moment I heard
about Knit Soc I knew they
would be my kind of soci-
ety- their meetings are held
in a bar and generally involve
someone providing cakes!
Rosa explained to me that Knit Soc
began when Jenny (Knit Soc president
and knitting enthusiast) used to spend
a lot of time in halls knitting. Rosa had
done some knitting while at school and
other friends in halls also wanted to get
knitting! After a while, the girls decid-
ed that knitting should be available to
everyone, so decided to start Knit Soc!
Since Spring term last year, Knit Soc
have been holding meetings in the
union bar, often attracting over thirty
knitters in one meeting!
Jenny explained to me that Knit Soc
caters for all standards and disciplines
of needle work. Often providing all the

Step 2:
Wind the wool from left to right,
around the back, and over the point
of the right-hand needle. Make sure
the wool is tight, as this will make
step 3 easier.
Step 1:
Hold the needle with the cast
on stitches in your left hand and
the loose wool at the back of the
work. Insert the right-hand nee-
dle from left to right through the
from of the first stitch.
Step 3:
Use the right-hand needle to draw
the wool through the stitch, form-
ing a new stitch on the right-hand
needle.
Step 4:
Slip the original stitch off the left-
hand needle, making sure to keep
the new stitch on the right-hand
needle.

The knit stitch, a step-by-step guide:
equipment and wool that members
need!
Knit Soc is one of the few societies
at Imperial to boast about having boys
in the club. One, of several males at
the first meeting, was DPFS Christian
Carter, who is currently knitting a very
fetching turquoise scarf. Apparently
knitting is a good way of keeping busy
when you can’t find any students that
need your help!
Finally, I ran out of searching ques-
tions to ask the Knit Soc old-hands and
had to have a go myself. The ‘knit stitch’,
shown below, is apparently the easiest
of knitting stitches. If that is the case,
my initial attempts suggested knitting
was beyond my levels of co-ordination:
It took me over half an hour to com-
plete one stitch. Once I got going I
proudly finished over twenty rows.
Unfortunately, my work was around
three times as wide, after twenty rows,
as it was at the beginning. What began
as a scarf, now most-closely resembles
a pair of under-pants!
