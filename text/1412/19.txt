Virgo
Did you know, that
as I write these very
words, a semi-naked
man is being rubbed
down with hot oil
in this very office!
I know what you’re thinking; Jov’s gone mad
and spent all of the felix budget on hookers,
again. Unfortunately no, that’s not why. If only
I was lucky enough to be rubbed down by a
gorgeous Polish blonde, instead of the Serbian
bear currently doing it.
Scorpio
This week I have
mostly been doing
my knitting, yes
knitting. No it is not
just for Grannies
and no, I don’t know
why I’m telling you this. Except, I know you
will understand. You’ve always understood me,
I honestly don’t think anyone else really does. I
don’t know why you won’t just marry me, I can
knit now, and cook, I’d be a lovely wife for you.
Libra
This week, the office
has been rather full
of old types, appar-
ently they used to
work here. But judg-
ing by the smell in
the back office, they were living here! Now that
they’ve graduated, they have poncey Bohemian
lives where they make films, and say things like
“carte blanche”. Fortunately they haven’t left
behind the Imperial arrogance we all love.
Sagittarius
This week it has
been officially
decided that this is
the last Horrorscope
to be written. What
to say... what to
say... Mmm difficult. Ok, I fingered myself in
the ass last night. I was showering and it was
quite soapy, I wanted to know what it would
feel like. Long story short, I should have taken
a dump before hand and it took a long time to
clean up the shower... I have no dignity
Capricorn
The majority of you
feel excluded from
the horoscopes.
Luckily 60% of you
will be hung in Beit
quad pirate style.
Leaving the other 40% to hide in fear. A futile
attempt, as the rogue Hangman team will
find you, and peel your skin from your flesh
in a leisurely pace. Collecting the HIV ridden
blood for their child molestation purposes.
Cancer
This week you
decide to see how
much sugar you
can consume
while writing the
horoscopes. After
6 cans of relentless, 4 packs of chewits and
a peperami for good measure, you find time
slows down to a sloths pace. To alleviate
yourself from this torture you start having
sexual intercourse with your keyboard. Sticky.
Gemini
This week one
editor will decide
to become a loan
shark. ENOCH will
want to borrow
£1, and will blindly
accept all terms and conditions. Pay him back
ENOCH. Quickly before the term “my money
or your life!” becomes a blood-curdling reality.
The moral of this story; pay back my DOLLAR
fool!!! In an unrelated incident, the crosswords
this week will be heavily altered.
Leo
This week you
discretely begin to
resent the other felix
editors for the music
they rampantly play
on their computers
at full volume. The situation becomes
decidedly worse when certain editors begin to
sing with tones similar to that of the African
Bullfrog. Due to the sad state of affairs, every
occurrence results in an angel vomiting.
Taurus
This week you
discover for the first
time bambi was a
dude. I can’t believe
I masturbated over
him/her/it. Now I
feel dirty. Whadafuh? That’ll be the new word
we created to explain this wretched situation.
All this arises due to the word bambi meat
being submitted by an editor who obviously
deserves more time in the psychiatric ward.
Aries
This week a
discussion about
ancient mythology
erupts within the
irritable bowels of
felix. It’s not long
before the words “I Egyption!?!” are spoken in
an apparently witty comment. Too bad heart
disease runs strong throughout the editors
family. The story promptly makes its way into
the horoscopes.
Pisces
This week a
tempestuous
argument over
the spelling of
hummus will
seize control over
your colleagues. The local restaurant insists
it is spelt hommos, and an editor’s mother
provides hummos to the mix, while felix
agrees it is hummous. No one cares as long as
no one starts a jihad. “Durkka durka moha...”
ok maybe I shouldn’t.
Horoscopes: felix editors’ inside jokes edition
Aquarius
This week you sit
apethetically in
the lecture theatre,
listening in on quite
possibly the most
boring speaker in
the world. Why the fuck is there a compulsory
lecture about CV’s? Good thing the unsus-
pecting lecturer is going to die of the overuse
of crack cocaine. She shivers, but it’s not
because it’s cold.
This week we said FUCK you guys, and made the horoscopes about ourselves... Enjoy
How to save money the Tamara way
The crisis has, of course, touched even
those of us who are financially com-
fortable. Even we are thinking about
economising.
Economising on heating
This is incredibly simple. We lowered
the temperature in our guest house
to +14 degrees. It cannot be lower
because it would start to damage the
antiques. If guests arrive we can make
the room comfortable in 2-3 hours but
what is the point of paying for heating
an empty house? Of course, with 800
square metres like ours you’re not go-
ing to save much but many people have
much bigger guest houses.
Economising on food
For me this is the easiest of all limita-
tions. Food is not a very big deal to me.
Here however, there is much scope
for economising. First of all, I have
asked the food stylist to be around for
the buying of food in Provence and
Bordeaux. Buying food here makes it
slightly less expensive and I am more
certain of the quality. Secondly, I drew
the attention of the junior chef to
cheaper local stores. Before, I used to
worry about the quality but this was
silly. The fresh bread and local vegeta-
bles aren’t too bad.
Economising on transport
I almost immediately gave up on
personal transport. In the current situ-
ation this is a big drain on funds and
also a headache. To my surprise, the
Lexus turned out to be bearable. Also,
Jonny (the driver) says our LS600 us a
very cheap car to run. I highly recom-
mend it, don’t take that as pestering
advertising.
Economising on housing
I have heard that many people advise
to rent out unused property, but of
course this is very tiresome and takes
a long time. For example, we’ve been
trying to rent our properties in Chel-
sea for almost a month and we’re really
struggling to find a decent realtor. I’m
hoping it will sort itself out soon. This
should cover the costs of keeping the
golf grounds and the gym decent.
Economising on personnel
With people it is the most difficult.
You get used to them and they become
practically part of your family. But in a
crisis we must tighten our belts. I had
to say goodbye to the groomer (hair
stylists for the pets) and asked the food
stylist to take care of buying food as
well. The curling instructor also had to
go, but my husband thanked him prop-
erly and I hear considerably helped his
home country, Iceland.
Economising on entertainment
For many this will be a huge shock, but
I am a quiet homey person so for me it
is not too difficult. My husband bought
a music system – Steinway Lyngdorf
which has a reasonably good sound so
now we listen to many musicians as re-
cordings rather than inviting them to
our place. I couldn’t help inviting El-
ton though to play a bit on the piano. I
don’t like how he sings particularly but
his playing is wonderful.
Economising on hobbies
Yes yes, now I have to economise on
the most pleasurable things. For exam-
ple, this year I decided against my idea
of completing my collection of late im-
pressionist paintings. This would have
required too much spending. How-
ever, I found a bargain in a golden sar-
cophagus from the epoch of the middle
kingdom.
Economising on the small things
Here I’ll repeat the time-honoured
wisdoms. Ask the doorman to pro-
gramme this system so it turns off
lights when you leave a particular floor.
Ask the accountant to be more careful
with the funds. Round all bills only to
the nearest thousand. Find something
which has become more of a drain on
your health rather than a pleasure and
sell it. My husband, for example, sold
the bank and I – my collection of black
diamonds even though I had to give
away a percentage to the sharks from
Sotheby’s.
With all this talk of a credit crunch and financial crisis, I asked a good friend of mine to give me some
tips on saving the pennies during these hard times.
In times of need - save money on clothes
Dear Tamara,
My roommate’s boyfriend had a go
while she was in the shower. For the last
few weeks, when he sees me in the cor-
ridor, he brushes past a little too close.
When she leaves the room, he’ll always
make a suggestive comment or two. A
few nights ago, he came round and as
soon as the door closed on her going to
the shower, he put hand suggestively on
my thigh and whispered “”. What do I
do?
Torn.
Dear Torn,
Judging by
the fact that you did not slap him in the
first place, you yourself wouldn’t mind
a go. Suggest the idea of a threesome to
your friend – tell her how much guys
would like you if they thought you two
got up to girly sausage-free slap and
tickle. She’ll soon catch on and you and
the guy can have guilt-free sex, just re-
member to remind her sometimes.
You’ll never have to watch Heroes re-
runs until they take the sock off the
door again.
Dear Tamara,
My boyfriend promised to help me write
into Felix about his need to talk dirtily
about science in bed. I sat down at my
laptop, ready to write to you and in-
stead of helping, he’s been on the phone
for the last 40 minutes to a friend from
his course discussing chemical reac-
tions. It disturbs me because I know
he’ll discuss the same reactions with me
later. Help, my sex life is at stake!
Inert gas.
Dear Inert gas,
Does the science talk not turn you on
just a little bit? I admit, I find it a wel-
come change from the “Ooh baby, what
a naughty nurse you are” and similar. I
find dressing up in a lab coat and in-
troducing props such a blackboard and
conical flasks into the bedroom really
helps me get in the mood. If this makes
him too hot, cool him down with some
liquid nitrogen. May I suggest some
phrases you can use in response?
- Baby, have we now reached thermal
equilibrium? - Shall we increase the
entropy in this room? - Let’s dis-
cover the resonant frequency of your
bed! - Do you want to see my Higg’s
boson? -
Tamara says: “Kill two birds with one cock!”
I really love scooters

The winner of Slitherlink 1,411 was
Jimmy Bibby! I’m totally lying. No one
actually entered this week! Please en-
ter. My life isn’t worth living otherwise.
We’ll give a prize out in the summer.
It’ll be good.
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:

Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers with
letters. Once you’ve completed
the puzzle, there is a hidden word
to find. Email answers to sudoku.

Hokay, so we screwed up. Last
issues Wordoku was uber hard,
the winning phrase was “JOV
HAS MEN” . [I do have a great
team behind me.- ed.]
