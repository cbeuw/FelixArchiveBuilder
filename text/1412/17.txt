Fashion Editor – Daniel Wan
P
eople have been complain-
ing I sound scarily angry in
anything I write for felix.
I think it’s justified, others
think it’s unnecessary and
crass. Writing as a way of venting feel-
ings is actually a really liberating meth-
od. Whether it holds the attention of
hundreds of people is another matter.
I mean, if you’ve managed to get this
far down my editorial column, I must
be doing something right. On the sub-
ject of getting things right, I’d just like
to state, and in no detriment to any
other member of the felix team, that
certain erroneous details in my com-
ment article about London transport
in last week’s issue, were simply not my
fault. But that’s all I’m going to say on
that matter. The situation has a similar
ring to when The Times Food Editor,
Giles Coren, wrote a horrific rant to his
own sub-editors because they edited a
single letter from his last line. I’m not
that pedantic and shall not be follow-
ing Coren’s lead. However even if no
one cares or spotted the mistakes, I
need to clarify the situation for, if for
no one else, myself.
For the first time this year I’ve decid-
ed to bring back the Cool/Lame Wall,
but it has been rebranded for no other
reason than it was sounding too much
like we were ripping off Top Gear, and
we all know the shirt, jeans and blazer
combination Jeremy Clarkson wears
every week is an anti-inspiration (if one
can even exist) to anyone in fashion.
Hence, I present to you the Sick/
Shit Wall. Now looking at it, the wall
is rather ankle-or-below-based. I don’t
have a weird foot fetish as you might
think. This week’s wall has been espe-
cially assembled with the inspiration of
the other editors in the felix office. I’m
not lazy, I’m just all up for team partici-
pation. That’s the official line anyway.
Our main article this week addresses
the issue of celebrity capsule collec-
tions that have invaded the highstreet
in recent years. Kate Moss has some
credibility in her launch of her Top-
shop range, whilst Pixie Geldof and the
like have none. They don’t have any real
license to launch anything other than
a valid career which isn’t leeching off
their name. I’m waiting for the launch
of a male celebrity collection. I laugh at
the thought of someone like Pete Do-
herty selling replica garments through
Topman, featuring his signature skag-
induced-soilage marks. To treat you
lucky fashionistas, we’re introducing
another new feature which follows on
from the Freshers’ guide to local shop-
ping in the SW’s. Anonymous is based
on Kings Road, which I demand any-
one that goes to Imperial and remotely
interested in some serious shopping to
go down to and spend a few hours of
your otherwise worthless lives looking
at things you probably can’t afford. We
owe an introduction to two new writ-
ers for felix fashion, Victoria and Swiri.
I’m sure you’ll be reading a lot more
from them in the coming weeks.
As I’ve always said, and I’m becoming
a bit of a parrot, if you want to write
for felix fashion, email your articles to
fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Contri-
butions are welcome and makes my life
a lot easier. Maybe I am lazy.

–List on the cheap
Victoria Masding discusses the celebrity-highstreet culture
I
am a sucker for supply and
demand. If something is in
short supply or limited edi-
tion, damn it, I want it! That’s
why I end up putting massive
maximum bids on Ebay, then hoping
no-one pushes up the price on that ‘too
cool’ jacket; but that is not my point.
Recently, you have probably noticed
lots of clothing chains have started
to introduce quick turnover capsule
collections, often fronted or even ‘de-
signed’ by celebrities. Even though I
know I am being manipulated, it’s not
all bad.
Uniqlo, for example, teamed up with
Logan Power Graphixx and The Ku-
sano Design Office to produce a range
of unique limited edition T’s to be sold
in their NYC flagship store. Of course,
this worked out for the guys at Uniqlo;
the T-shirts were a sell out. It appeared
the allure for consumers was not sim-
ply the limited stock, but also the de-
sign talent behind the T’s. Definitely a
hit.
Another hit earlier this summer was
when online fashion megastore asos.
com teamed up with graduate students
from The London College of Fashion
and launched the ASOS LTD 100 Col-
lection.Anonlinefrenzyensuedthanks
to well planned publicity during Grad-
uate Fashion Week and celebrities like
model Agyness Deyn showcasing the
best garments. Most items sold out in
minutes, each design perfectly unique
in existence. Convincing people their
clothing purchase is an investment is
clever, and not without a glimmer of
truth with designer John Galliano and
model Erin O’Connor among the Col-
lege’s Alumni. These pieces could have
been designed by the big names of to-
morrow and as such this was the key
focus of this endeavour.
Mainstream designer collaborations
like the Victor & Rolf and Stella McCa-
rtney for H&M lines were also success-
ful, as well as their smaller Madonna-
fronted range.
I guess the heavyweight of celeb-
rity fashion collections would be Kate
Moss for Topshop. Again, the design
quality is good – in part due to ripping
off her existing wardrobe, but you can-
not argue with the phenomenal success
of her range. The pictures of devotion
on the faces of hundreds of eager shop-
pers outside Topshop Oxford Street at
the launch were almost biblical! She
has since become a seemingly perma-
nent fixture of the Topshop brand.
It is not all good news, however. If
you’ve seen any recent magazines you
will know that Peaches (Geldof) is a
Topshop whore – she clearly wants
what Kate Moss has. Sadly for Peaches
her younger, more attractive sibling,
Pixie, has scored the deal with New
Look. Not that I am particularly im-
pressed. I think the correct term to
describe my reaction would be that
I ‘scoffed’ when I heard the news. I
prefer the Gilmore Girls to the Gel-
dof girls. Pixie’s collection seems to be
standard ‘rebel teen’ fare, uninspiring
whilst filling me with smouldering in-
difference. Nor was I a fan of the Lily
Allen/New Look combo. I struggle to
see the relevance of this pair in connec-
tion to clothes designing. I don’t like
the ‘any-celeb-to-boost-sales’ pattern.
It’s the Mary Kate and Ashley theory.
They could offer your own shit to you
with a sticker of their faces on it and we
would buy! We’re clearly doomed to be
consumer clones! Fuck it – bring it on!

Shopping locally in the SWs
What has Swiri Konje’s boutique-spotting yielded this week?
Anonymous by Ross & Bute. It’s a
designer boutique on King’s Road
next to the famous Bluebird Café. At
London Fashion Week their amazing
display of dresses was a treat for my
sore eyes. Watch out for their spring
collection but in the meantime, their
autumn winter dresses are just the
thing to go for.
Mixing style with comfort and putting your figure in the best style possible is just what you want
at this time of year. Were I deep in the pockets, this will be my number one shop, so if you are,
why don’t you make it yours?
Of course if you want to spend that huge amount of money on a perfect birthday dress, or those
amazing set of heels which you will wear only twice a year, then for the love of Satan splurge,
go this shop. You won’t regret it.

This week is clothes, next week it’s shoes. Watch out as I bring you little titbits about shops
to visit before you leave London.
Rolled-up jeans
Its getting colder, so this is
probably the opposite of what
you want to be doing; but
being practical is for losers
who turn up the heating in
their room to simulate Level
7 Dungeon environment. Roll
up your jeans, anywhere up
to just below your knees, and
watch your ankles go blue.
Nike Hi-Tops
I wasn’t ever too sure about
these. A little Chav and a bit
Nu-rave. The News Editor,
oddly enough, has convinced
me otherwise. Get the right
colour, but don’t dress too in-
your-face, otherwise you’ll just
be another pretentious prick.
And we don’t need more of
them at Imperial. Plus, Nike
have some new sweet varia-
tions on these out.
Sandals
Many women have this thing
– they wear sandals to ‘fancy’
events. They do this regard-
less of the time of year or
amount of expected precipi-
ation. Very few high-heeled
sandals suit women without
making them look somewhat
‘cheap’. Unless you have
abnormally good-looking feet
and have found some incred-
ible sandals, this is a dreadful
idea. No one wants to see
your horrible toes.

W
ith hardware get-
ting smaller, and
hard disk storage
getting bigger, we
continuously hear
horror stories of notebook fires and
overheating.
Sure, this is quite a rare scenario.
However, my worry-o-meter increas-
es along with the noise level of my
Macbook Pro’s fans, and the redness
of the skin on my lap. But the fire
could be caused from anywhere in
the house. It might not even be a fire,
but any form of disaster, and my data,
along with all copies of backups will
be destroyed.
How can I prevent my paranoia? I
could use my 1 TB Terastation more
often, or find some automatic soft-
ware to backup my file changes on
regular intervals. But I lack physical
protection on local disaster.
I could promise to burn a monthly
DVD, and send it to a friend’s house.
Here, I lack security of data, and risk
being lazy and forgetting. The list
goes on. And sure, security is no big
issue when using software such as
Truecrypt, but this is another step
between me and regular backups.
In an ideal world, I would have a
free, “infinite” storage, earthquake-
proof underground-bunker, which I
could make regular and encrypted
backups to with software which regu-
larly looks for file changes and backs
up on computer inactivity.
Unfortunately, we are not in an ideal
world. There is a small choice of two
configurations for the ideal world:
The storage is as above, but not free.
The storage is not infinite.
My worry about the first, is miss-
ing a payment. Being a student, I feel
very likely to miss one of my monthly
payments, and therefore will lose my
backup data. A personal choice would
be to have the limited space, but with
all the data protection and services as
listed.
There are numerous solutions, such
as Microsoft’s Sky Drive, XDrive,
cron jobs, etc. One really caught my
eye since it was in beta, and that was
Mozy. Mozy’s award-winning backup
software promises “insurance for
your data”, and it definitely delivers
what it promises.
I have used it since Mozy was in
beta, and have always been satisfied.
Backup up settings, firefox bookmarks
and essential work-related documents
made my free 2 GB storage limit feel
more than satisfactory. Mozy’s back-
up sets are very intelligent and easy to
use, something anyone who has had
experience with iTunes’ smart play
lists or similar and/or statements can
master in seconds.
There was a point where I had to
stop using Mozy when switching to
my Mac. There was no alternative
available, and I really loved Mozy’s
solution. My prayers (and emails) have
been answered recently when Mozy
announced their Mac version, which
is equally excellent and unobtrusive.
I forget it even runs and backs up my
data whilst I deal with my leg burns.
Is 2 GB too small? Not a problem.
You can easily upgrade your account
to a Mozy Home account, giving in-
finite storage for $4.95 / month. Or,
you could take my method, and use
referrals. Four referrals give an extra
gigabyte of storage, and gives each
person who uses the referral code to
sign up their share of the same space,
and therefore both benefit from the
Mozy referral system.
One thing I am yet to understand
about Mozy’s software, is the differ-
ence between their personal software
(Mozy Home) and their business so-
lution (Mozy Pro). Mozy Pro is more
server orientated, but does not of-
fer too much more, and in fact, does
NOT supply infinite storage. Unless
the extra features are needed, I rec-
ommend Mozy Home for now.
I would begin this paragraph by say-
ing “Overall,” but there is no need to.
Mozy is truly a great piece of software,
and I am unable to say one bad thing
about it. I am not saying that Mozy is
great “overall”, but completely.
This unobtrusive application runs in
your Windows XP/Vista system tray,
or if you are using the (better) Mac OS
X, it will run in your menu bar. Even
with it installed, try not to spill that
pint. Waste of beer.

Google Android. The iPhone Killer?
A
new and exciting plat-
form has risen from the
Internet powerhouse
that is Google. With the
ever-increasing popu-
larity that is the mobile telecommu-
nications market, various strides to
improve the functionality and ease of
use of these devices have been made.
The biggest revolution in recent
times being Apple’s popular iPhone.
Revolutionising the way mobile
phones are used, the iPhone has
brought full web-browsing, email,
music playback and many other fea-
tures in a new and intuitive way.
However there is a new threat to this
young super power. That threat is the
Google Android platform.
Unlike the iPhone, Android is only
the operating software. Designed by
Google and free to be manipulated by
client users. The Android platform,
with its first iteration the T-Mobile
G1, is right on track to provide an al-
ternative user experience. Android’s
customising ability allows users to
have an equally intuitive and “fun”
adventure when using their phone.
With compatibility for almost any
feature the phone’s hardware may
contain, end-users will be able to
browse the Internet, email and add
applications like the best of them.
Android has also been successfully
installed on current phones such as
Nokia’s N810 Internet tablet, with
intriguing results. Expect Android to
filter its way to future phones. Look at him. So cute. I want one... or 2, maybe 3. Gimmie, gimmie.
