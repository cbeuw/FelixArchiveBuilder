Caesar and Machiavelli. However,
something is lost in Revolver – and
it isn’t just the plot.
Con man and gambling extraordi-
naire Jack Green (Jason Statham
- does it even matter what his char-
acters are named anymore?) gets
out of prison after being screwed
by his previous boss, Macha (Ray
Liotta), and quickly screws him back
at Macha’s casino in a game of flip-
the-coin. Macha quickly dispatches
a couple of hit men (one of whom
later provides the only entertaining
scene in the whole movie) to remove
the insult, but Green is saved by two
mysterious characters, Avi and Zach
(played by Benjamin and Pastore),
who pull Green along in a bizarre,
confusing plot that doesn’t seem to
culminate in anything.
It’s difficult to pin down why
Revolver is a terrible film. The
movie is long, and the plot is point-
less and confusing, but Ritchie’s
previous hits were arguably similar.
The directing is still original and
stylish – though noticeably more
experimental and less sure of itself.
The acting talent is in abundance
and all of the main characters give
a strong showing. Even the music
is great. However, there must be
some concept of reverse-synergy
O
riginal writer and
director Guy Ritchie
and charismatic every-
man Jason Statham
really had something
going on with Lock, Stock, and
Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and
Snatch (2000). Pair the two up
again, add the sneering and intimi-
dating Ray Liotta, mob essential
Vincent Pastore, and serious new
talent Andre Benjamin (the half
of Outkast who acquitted himself
respectably in Four Brothers this
year), and Revolver should be an
ace in the hole, right?
Not at all. Perhaps the fact that
Jason Statham has hair is the first
indication of Ritchie’s departure
from the formula that we enjoyed
so much in his previous films. Or
maybe it’s the opening quotes from
Guy Ritchie is back! (Or not...)
arts.
It’s nothing like Barrels or Snatch. Don’t revolve... just avoid
where the combination of acting,
directing, cinematography, and writ-
ing is monumentally less than the
sum of its parts. In fact the theme
of the movie seems to be talent and
creativity put to waste. The scene
in which Green fights his inner self
inside an elevator is a microcosm
for the whole movie: it’s artistically
and originally done, yet it’s boring
and drags on tortuously.
Perhaps that’s because the film
makes the audience wonder wheth-
er they’ve missed something, or
whether the scene they saw last
has nothing to do with anything.
Perhaps that’s because the film
delves too deeply into the mind of
the main character for the audience
to relate or attach to him. Maybe it’s
because the character interaction is
actually very limited, unlike Barrels
and Snatch, denying us the humor-
ous and enjoyable back-and-forth
dialogue. It might even be because
the film attempts to be dark, pen-
sive, introspective, spiritual, com-
plicated, original, and creative, but
forgets to make an attempt to be
entertaining. In that case, the best
word to describe it is pretentious.
Or boring. And I know I’m not alone
in thinking this – I could see the
disgust and disbelief on everybody’s

One of the Machiavelli quotes
at the beginning of the film reads:
“There is no avoiding war; it can
only be postponed to the advantage
of [your enemy]”. Well, you can
avoid Revolver, and that certainly
would be to your own advantage.
