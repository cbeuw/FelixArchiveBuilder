As the Premiership season
progresses the cries in the national
media seem to have deviated from
claims made in previous years about
it being the best league in the world
to performing some sort of long
drawn out funeral sermon. Most of
these premature obituaries cover
a variety of the games alleged ills
from falling attendance levels to the
dominance of Chelsea via the view
that the game is now just plain bor-
ing. Some commentators were even
prepared to back up their claims
with their own cash. In the sports
speculators bible The Racing Post
tipster Tony Cascarino advised read-
ers to bet Liverpool and Chelsea
to play out another scoreless draw.
Hopefully the resulting 4-1 scoreline
didn’t hurt too many pockets. Here
now is a brief outline of some of the
recent whinges about the beautiful
game and why they should not be
listened to.
A common complaint this season
is that matchday attendance figures
have suffered due to a combination
of excessive TV coverage and high
ticket prices. Increased prices are
just an inevitable consequence of
the games immense popularity so
tough cheese. It could be argued
that high prices actually allow more
fans to see their team at some point
in the season as it reduces demand
for “regular” tickets. Sympathy
must be felt for the fans who have
to travel long distances in time for
a midday Saturday kick-off but at
the same time we must accept that
the days of the entire fixture card
kicking off at 3pm are consigned to
history and that the game is better
off because of it. Schedules have

“Why should Rupert Murdoch get
to specify when my beloved team
plays?” I hear you cry. Well this is
why. You want to watch megastars
on mega-salaries? Then the game
has to have the ability to generate
the funds to assemble your dream
team. Apart from the occasional oli-
garch the vast majority of clubs rely
on their supporters for cash flow.
Increased media coverage makes
clubs far more marketable and
hence more profitable. Any loss on
matchday ticket sales to television
will be dwarfed by the sums of addi-
tional revenue teams have enjoyed
over the past ten years from the sat-
ellite companies and also by indirect
income via the extra fans drawn to
the game by all this new publicity.
In particular this rings true with
regards to the overseas markets.
Somelamentthefactthatthegame
is now in thrall to big money. When
people mention big money the team
that springs to mind is Abramovich’s
Chelsea. To an extent money does
buy success in terms of the person-
nel you can afford but no amount of
cash can buy team spirit or tactical
genius both of which Chelsea have
by the bucketload. It was only a few
years ago that Man Utd suppos-
edly had an unassailable postion at
the top of the game. Not even the
most diehard red would make that
claim now. Best of luck to Chelsea I
hope they enjoy their purple patch
but it is by no means a permanent
arrangement. The finances of foot-
ball are merely an example of the
free market system that is responsi-
ble for our great society in its purest
form. Astronomical salaries for the
outrageously talented ensure that
only the best make it onto the pitch

Wage caps? No chance! Socialism
is a doctrine that has been tested to
destruction across the world. We’d
have to be fairly stupid to allow it to
poison our Premiership
So self-righteous whingers please
leave our game alone. We know you
are probably part of the brigade who
declared cricket the “new” football
following England’s magnificent tri-
umph over Australia. Whilst it is
always good to see (dare I say it)
the less well followed sports have
their day at the same time it is
delusional to think that any sport
will overtake football as our chief
sporta franca in terms of revenue
and viewing figures. Who has the
gall to present fans with these false
dichotomies? I mean following foot-
ball and cricket, rugby or whatever
else you are interested in are not
mutually exclusive pursuits. Lastly
to those of you who now believe
the game is now just boring due to
the tactical conservatism of some
managers. This is a perfectly valid
opinion but before expressing it so
vehemently I urge you to consider
following Mr Cascarino’s example
and putting your money where your
mouth is. It would be churlish to
criticise the game otherwise.
For those of you who really want
to affirm your loyalty to the game
what could be a better tribute than
playing yourself? IC Football Club
are currently recruiting for the
new season with trials taking place
this Saturday. With seven teams all
standards of player are welcomed
in to the fold so come along. If
your missed signing up at freshers
fair but still want to get involved
contact the club captain at mark.
