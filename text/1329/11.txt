ALBUM REVIEWS
Hello students, and welcome to a
new year at Imperial College! Did
you have a good holiday? You look
great with that tan! Ok, so today
we’re going to start you off on a new
activity to practice for the new year.
I call this one “How to form your
own trendy rock band.” It’s sim-
ple! Everyone’s doing it these days,
such as recent London beat combo
The Rakes, with their debut album
Capture/Release.
First off, get your band together
and write a handful of good, catchy
numbers so as to attract enthusi-
asm. Make sure they are genuinely
interesting, filling them with unu-
sual turns of tune to make attractive
to the ear and brain, such as the
breakdown in Retreat or the sud-
den monologue in Work, Work, Work
(Pub, Club, Sleep). Write the lyrics
full of observations on modern life,
such as the work/life balance in the
aformentioned Retreat, or the cold
war divide in the opener Strasbourg,
so you make sure the songs actually
mean something.
Got enough attention now? Good,
time to write the full album. But
hang on there; writing enough
songs, especially to a good stand-
ard, just takes too long these days
doesn’t it? No no no, what you need
to do is rush out an unchallenging,
derivative album, which is quick and
easy to produce. Besides, with all
the hype you’ve produced, who’s to
know or care?
If you’re stuck for material, fill
the album up with pointless guitar
noodling with slapdash references
to money to make it sound slight-
ly relevant. The Rakes have a fine
example in the form of 22 Grand
Job, the confused thuggery on show
in T-Bone, or, when all else fails,
just shout randomly for five minutes:
listen to The Guilt if for some mad
reason you’re unsure on how to do
this. Be sure to include some reggae
influences in there, everyone likes
those now (Violent).
Scruples are a lot like talking to
your neighbours; everyone gave that
up ages ago. But if you still have
some, you might like to make the
effort to include a few other catchy
tunes; why not pen a heartfelt track
called Open Book about the embar-
rassment of breaking-up complete
with a rocking pseudo glam-rock
riff? If it goes well you can reuse it
throughout the entire album. Maybe
you can experiment with some elec-
tronica and turn it into an atmos-
pheric piece called (with distinct
punnage) Binary Love?
So now you’re album is competed.
Congratulations! Now all you have to
do is sit back, enjoy the praise from
the music press, and eat up the one
year of comfort until people realize
you’ve released an album lacking
in substance or real meatiness and
then attempt to burn out with dignity.

It is a real shame that Coldplay,
our greatest British hope for world-
wide “indie” success, have failed to
push any boundaries with their lat-
est album. Though people who don’t
encounter anything more challeng-
ing than the Sugababes won’t have
ever heard anything like Fix You,
others will realise that it is a very
old and used formula. When Chris
Martin said, “people won’t realise
how much we have stolen until they
listen to the album,” I didn’t realise
how literally he was using the word
“stolen.”
Luckily Leaves have come along
and produced the album Coldplay
should have made. In its entirety,
The Angela Test is epic sounding
and anthemic, yet imbued with maj-
esty and ethereal qualities more
common to fellow Icelanders Sigur
Ros. Instead of taking the “one man
at a piano straining his bollocks off”
approach to song writing, Leaves go
for rich orchestration, soulful vocals
and spine-tingling chordality.
Bizarrely, the album starts with
their most epic song, the jaw-drop-
ping Shakma. It starts off melodic
and yearning, with warm piano and
soft brass, yet explodes into snare-
powered abandon, with more than a
slight hint of post-rock. Last single
The Spell employs the same kind of
motivation as the end of Shakma,
yet continued throughout and punc-
tuated by cymbal heavy build-ups
and choruses. The title track Angela
Test is possibly the best song on
the album; synths shimmer softly
and tense silences are left as the
band adds very Icelandic backing
vocals. It builds with percussion that
sounds like a whole marching band,
giving the whole track a feeling of
magnificence.
Unfortunately there are a few
tracks that lack any sense of iden-
tity. Silver Night is based around
one guitar riff, leaving it sound-
ing very unremarkable, and The
Transparent is similarly unexcep-
tional. As We Walk goes nowhere in
particular and could be from their
debut album Breathe. On the con-
trary, Good Enough and Whatever
are a lot more rock than you would
find in their back-catalogue, utilising
the kind of pounding drums indie
heavyweights Doves would. Killing
Flies is actually quite a strange song,
with very simple piano, roiling time
signatures, those pounding drums
again and staccato strings. Still, it all
sits together perfectly.
Our country isn’t quite ready to
embrace a band from Iceland as
their own, which means that this
release will largely go unnoticed by
all except the critics. If you’re just
starting uni and want to get into
something a bit different, you could
do worse than using The Angela Test
as your starting point.

I will apologise in advance. Getting
hold of a copy of the I Saw Such
Things In My Sleep EP by new
FantasticPlasticsigningsGuillemots
is going to be tricky: limited to a run
of 1000 CDs, it sold out in two weeks.
although I do believe you can pick it
up on Ebay for about ten times its
original retail value.
So why the hype? Frankly, because
they are gorgeous. They make you
smile, they make you shiver and
they make every Belle & Sebastian
album in your collection defunct.
The EP opens with the exuberant
Who Left The Lights Off Baby, which
sounds like what a cocktail party
tastes like; bouncy piano driving it
along and a vaguely ridiculous (but
still ace) saxophone solo. The record
becomes much more chilled-out
with Cats Eyes, as the instrumenta-
tion drops down to lightly brushed
drums and echoed backing vocals.
If you listen carefully you notice that
underpinning it all are strings, bass
clarinets and piano keys poured over
the track like warm toffee. Mmmm.
Made Up Love Song #43 is almost
overbearingly tender (work that one
out), the soulful and earnest vocals
of singer Fyfe starting it all off, sing-
ing about nonsense like “sparks and
shining dragons”, until you realise
it’s all a ploy to hide his feelings: “I
love you, I don’t think you care”. As
if to mend his broken heart the rest
of the band join him with driving
drums and bass, angular guitars,
ethereal synth noises and heart-
warming harmonies. Divine.
You know what? That ten times
face value you will have to pay for
Guillemots’ first outing may well be
worth it, because who knows how
high that price will go? You’ll be
very hard pushed to find a more self
assured and wonderful debut, this
band is almost spookily well formed.
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

DEMO REVIEWS
Are you sick and tired of hearing
that the only things that Imperial
guys can hold onto are their calcula-
tors? And that our sense of humour
leaves a lot to be desired? I am.
Fortunately, this evil stereotype is
about to be shattered, thanks to
the dirty, noisy and breaky sound
from Dan and Ross of usedtobe-
cool, (who, believe it or not, used to
piss about in the Blackett and the
Huxley, respectively and spin fire
in the quad just like the rest of you
munters do).
Think Daft Punk and Roni Size
before they got fat and became
friends with the politically-correct
lobby, give it the precise firing of
Tel Aviv’s nuclear weapons pro-
gramme, imagine glass shattering
due to an orgasm being that good
and then you’ve just about got it.
Intelligent dance music at its best:
Squarepusher in a word.
The breakcore kicks off atmos-
pherically, with the futuristic Just
The Thing before descending fur-
ther into a depraved world with the
industrial breakbeats of the intrin-
sically sexy Classically Trained
Groupie. Robotik noizes take you
to the next level on Magical Love
Adventure before forcing you to
dance, frantically, to It’s Not You, It’s
Your Face. The beats are shit hot,
grindingly insistent; Nellee Hooper
would retreat back across the
Severn into the valleys and end his
days in a Caerphilly cave if he could
get hold of this stunner. Hell yes.
The sampling is irreverent to say
the least, cracking the listener up
no end so that when you’re dancing,
moshing, moving, you’re bound to
have a smile on your face, especially
with the Paedofinder General and
his machine guns on Perversion
For Profit. Parentally explicit, prob-
ably not.
Vogue Says sees the guys getting
perilously close to social commen-
tary, screeching its way to oblivion
before giving way to the hypnotic
Visions Of Custard. This compels
you once more to the dancefloor,
with snare breaks taking care to
deconstruct a SouthWestNine vor-
tex to keep you rapt. N00b tinkles
its way into your consciousness
and fails to leave. So too does the
deliciously bassy Grind Meh which
keeps you dancing the way a good
Asian Dub Foundation track should,
with its rhythmic noise captivating
you to stick around for more. The
compelling beats, dirty snares and
humourous samples of yore are
present in droves on the distorted
jungle of Closet Bedwetter, but I
somehow can’t force myself to like
this one. Canine Devotion and I
Like You fare much better before
the junglistic Domination comes in
to finish off a fantastic party with
verve and vigour. The room gets
cleared with a break-ridden remix
of Blink 182’s Fuck A Dog and all is
calm once more.

Welcome, or welcome back, depend-
ing on whether you’ve just started
Imperial or if you’re one of the griz-
zled old hands like myself.
As you can see, Music is back in
full swing, and we’re looking for
writers to fill these hallowed pages
with their rantings. It doesn’t mat-
ter if you’ve not written before; we’ll
give you a chance. Although the
vast majority of music we are sent is
“indie” and we’re always in need of
indie writers, there’s still a substan-
tial amount of chart and pop that
we receive and do not have writers
willing to review, so if you think you
could redress this balance, drop us a
line (the email is at the end).
This year, there will be a few
changes to Music’s format. We plan
to start introducing writer’s charts,
so you can see what’s currently float-
ing our respective boats, debates
around topical news from the music
world, and more demo reviews.
Hopefully, this should make Music
less like a collection of reviews, and
more personal.
Lastly, this summer has been
an excellent few months for new
records. Here’s a short guide to
my summer listening: Dust From
1000 Years - Self Titled (sinister,
extremely lo-fi folk on cassette),
Why? - Elephant Eyelash (Anticon’s
brightest star’s new album), Aoki
Takamasura & Tujiko Noriko - 28
(thoughtful, reflective electronica on
Fat Cat), Honey For Petzi - Man’s
Rage For The Black Ham (insanely
good mathrock from Switzerland).
