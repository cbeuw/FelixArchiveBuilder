Two years ago I knew noth-
ing about television broadcasting,
except that it helped having a tel-
evision set if you wanted to see any-
thing. Last year, I was involved in
creating a short documentary that
was broadcast on national televi-
sion. And there is no denying it, it
was awesome-the feeling of achieve-
ment that is!
If this takes your fancy, have a
wander down to stoic tv in the West
Wing of Beit Quad. Don’t worry if
you have no idea about the business
- you don’t have to be a film buff
to get the most out of this society.
And need we mention the potential
career opportunities you’d have with
some hands on experience? But that
isn’t the only point of stoic tv- mostly
we’re seeing how much we can get
away with and how many celeb’ par-
ties we can gatecrash just because
we’re holding a tv camera!
Whatever happens, there is loads
on throughout the year and we’re
holding a few workshops to intro-
duce you to our kit (which is pretty
hot), our studio, and show you some
of the stuff we have done- from films
to news- or more importantly, what
you can do. All of us are approach-
able and some of us aren’t even
technical wizards- me, for example!
There is a place here for everyone-
we need ‘front-of-camera’ people as
much as technical staff. It’s a really
good conduit for an ego that needs
a little massaging (we LOVE it) or a
creative writer with a crazy idea for
the next ‘Blair Witch Project’ (we
LOVE it even more). Alternatively,
if you like lots of attention because
you’re holding a large piece of shiny,
technical material in your hand then
this is the place for you.
Its loads of fun, its all tongue
in cheek- and we have a national
awards ceremony we get to attend
every year, just like real TV!
The first step to getting involved
is attending a freshers workshop
(whether you’re a fresher or not!). If
you like what you see then become
a member, sign-up to a few pro-
grammes or start one of your own.
There will also be more formal train-
ing sessions so that you can use our
kit to its fullest potential.

Liquid Lunch – Weekdays
12-2pm
This week on Liquid Lunch it’s
all about dogs and dates.
Dogs because Martin was
at the premiere to Wallace &
Gromit: The Curse of the Were-
Rabbit. You’ll be able to hear
the interviews he got with the
likes of Nick Park (director), Peter
Sallis (the voice of Wallace) and
Ralph Fiennes (the villain of the
movie) on air. Plus there are
photos available on the Liquid
Lunch micro-site (www.icradio.
com/shows/liquidlunch) showing
the giant blowup Gromit and the
green carpet in all its splendour.
Dates because our dating fea-
ture called Liquid Love begins
on Tuesday. So if there’s some-
one that you’ve taken a fancy
to over Freshers’ Week, why
not get in contact with us. We’ll
ask the object of your affections
out on that crucial first date on
your behalf. The both of you
could be going for a night out to
Revolution Soho for a meal and
drinks on us. So give it a go, you
might have the time of your life
and not have to spend a penny.
We’ve got all the usual
features too, including TV
Titbits with wannabe TV star
Matt Cunningham and Movie
Mondays with Duncan Pearse
where you could win cinema
tickets courtesy of our friends at
Odeon Kensington.
(Instru)Mental - Thursdays
9-11pm
Don’t fancy another night of
cheese at the union? Check out
(Instru)Mental. Now in its third
year, we bring you the best in
hard house, hard trance and hard
techno.
The first hour includes fea-
tures, chat and the latest on
what’s happening in the hard
dance world, while in the second
expect a back to back mix taking
you through the latest music for
the harder generation, as well as
some of the classics that got the
hard scene going. Expect tracks
from the likes Riot!, Tidy Trax
and the mighty Vicious Circle.
Next week: Beer & Biscuits
If you want to get involved in
IC Radio, presenting your own
show or helping out behind the
scenes, we’ll be holding our
annual Beer and Biscuits evening
on Thursday 13th October.
Look out for more details in
next week’s Felix.
Listen to IC Radio online at
icradio.com or on 1134AM
across the Wye campus.

Loisa Evans explains what being a part of Imperial’s tv station is all about
The workshops consist of three
sessions, each lasting about an
hour. The first two involve produc-
ing a short light entertainment pro-
gramme –it tends to be quite chaotic
but it’s always good fun. We’re not
trying to produce a BAFTA award-
winning entertainment show, just
give you an idea of how things work
at stoic tv.
Studio
In the studio you’ll be able to
have a go at being a presenter.
Confidence is a must as somehow
you need to talk to a camera as if
it’s a huge group of people watching
on a screen somewhere. The ability
to talk non-stop is helpful, but you
are largely at the mercy of the rest
of the crew to feed you the infor-
mation you need and do what you
are expecting. There’s nothing quite
like introducing a segment and then
looking in horror into the camera as
you realise there is no VT to play.
For the more reserved among us,
why not have a go at controlling a
camera, as instructed by the pro-
gramme’s director. Or you could
be the floor manager – this person
is essentially in charge of the stu-
dio and is responsible for making
sure everyone knows what they are
doing, from telling the presenters
which camera to look at to counting
into and out of video segments so
that the presenters know when to
stop and start talking.
Gallery
The gallery is the nerve centre of
any recording. It’s here that you’ll
find the boss, or the director. The
director’s job is to keep the whole
show on track – from deciding what
the cameras should do to cueing in
video segments, or just telling the
presenters to wrap it up because
they’re being dull. If you like shout-
ing and bossing people around then
this is the job for you, but at the
same time you need a cool head
as you have to be thinking not just
about what is happening now, but
also about what is happening next.
The director works closely with
the vision mixer, who controls which
pictures go to tape (or to broadcast
if it’s a live show). There’s also a
sound mixer who does a similar
thing for audio, and VT operators
who play in video footage such as
music videos and interviews. They
also need to press record at the
start of the show, otherwise people
will get very upset when you tell
them that they have to it all again.
Editing
Most programmes need to go
through post-production after being
recorded before they make it to the
screen. At its simplest, editing is
simply rearranging bits of video into
the right order and length. Then
you add captions, music, graphics,
special effects…. The list is endless.
It can take a very long time but the
results can be spectacular.
To give you a taster, we’ll produce
a trailer for a film or TV show from
a set of clips we’ve prepared. You’ll
get to call the shots, deciding what
goes where and how to make it look
perfect.
If editing is your chosen art, then
we’ll give you dedicated training on
the use of our suites so you know
how to do all the basics. All you need
is creativity and imagination.
Interested?
If all that sounds like fun, then
come and get involved. We’ll be run-
ning two workshops: on Sunday 9th
October and again on Wednesday
12th October, both from 2pm. And
because we all know that bribery
works, there’ll be free food, beer and
soft drinks.
