Henley, the ‘Royal Regatta’, an event
heaped in traditions and old fash-
ioned etiquette, a genuine event on
the social calender and a chance to
get dressed up in top hats and tails.
However, and many people seem to
forget this, it is also the pinnacle of
the rowing season, and the main
target for the Imperial College Boat
Club.
The club went into the regatta on
a high, buoyed by the double success
of the girls’ squad at Women’s Henley
a fortnight beforehand, and a cheeky
novice sculls win at Richmond for
the Tron.
However, all was not well, with a
complication with the entries result-
ing in one of our eights missing out.
Despite this, though, there was still
a strong IC contingent looking to
bring back some silverware. This
year most of the club’s top athletes
were competing in fours: A coxless
four in the Visitors’ Challenge Cup,
and two crews in the Men’s Student
Coxed Fours – an event which the
club won last year, along with the
remaining eight.
First up on the Wednesday morn-
ing was the ‘A’ four, entered as a com-
posite with Goldsmith’s College (due
to Ben’s perhaps misguided fond-
ness for arty stuff), who comfortably
disposed of Durham Uni ‘B’. Next
came some disappointment for the
eight, who were never really in their
race and consequentially lost out to a
crew from the holders Nereus. After
a spot of lunch it was the turn of the
second coxed four, who had drawn
old rivals Oxford Brookes’ ‘B’ crew.
Henley Royal Regatta 2005
As they passed our vantage point,
just before halfway, our boys were
over a length down and appeared to
be struggling. However, it’s just not
the IC way to give up, so back they
came and in the space of the last
500 metres rowed through Brookes
to take the race by 1 length! So, a
good day all told, and with the fours
off to get some well deserved rest,
various members of the eight hit
the town for some alcohol induced
shenanigans...
Thursday morning came easier for
some than others, and with just the
one IC crew competing (the coxed
fours had a day off), this turned out
to be the quietest day of the regatta.

Ten days in Barcelona and Valencia
sounds like a good holiday to most
people, but add to that the thought
of ten days with 26 IC hockey play-
ers, and you’re pretty much in heav-
en, right?! Well, I’m not sure what
the Spaniards thought, but we had a
pretty good time.
Our first stop was Barcelona:
home of Gothic, Gaudi and Human
Statues.
With such a rich offering of culture,
Barcelona easily absorbed five days
of our time, as we took in sites such
as La Sagrada Familia, Park Guell,
the Olympic Village, the Noucamp
Stadium. We also managed to spend
a bit of time at the beach, where
English cricket’s summer of suc-
cess really began, as ICHC man-
aged to get even the Spanish peo-
ple interested in their enthralling
beach-style simulation of the Ashes!
It should also be noted that
Barcelona also boasts a world
famous Communications Tower,
which delighted the more physics-
orientated hockey players amongst
us, giving them a chance to revel in
their engineering roots amidst an
otherwise sports and culture orien-
tated trip!
Barcelona’s nightlife also deserve
a mention. I think the words Sangria,
Anyhow, the Visitors’ four, a crew
made up of three of last year’s win-
ning four along with ex-IC man Tom
Gale, didn’t disappoint with a com-
fortable victory over a crew from
Lake Victoria, South Africa.
With three crews still in the
regatta on Friday, this was look-
ing like a pretty good year for the
club. However the day didn’t start
off that well, with the second coxed
four coming up against a formidable
crew from Durham Uni (the eventu-
al winners of the event) who looked
in control throughout and took the
win by one length. There was bet-
ter news for the first four, who went
through with an ‘easily’ verdict
at the expense of Okeanos, from
Holland. Unfortunately, though, the
coxless four, crippled by the loss
of Ed through illness, struggled
to match a strong crew (also the
eventual winners) from the National
University of Ireland. So, one crew
left going into the weekend, and
the rest of us headed for the pub,
and then onto the glorious Latinos
nightclub, where I don’t even think
anyone managed to get into a fight!
On Saturday the focus was on
two things: Firstly cheering on the
coxed four, and secondly drinking
lots (of other peoples’) Pimms. So
first things first – they faced a deter-
mined Nat Uni of Ireland crew (a dif-
ferent one), who were always going
to fight all the way to the line. As
the crews passed our (slightly ille-
gal) gazebo, we were ahead and all
looked rosy, however the commen-
tary told the story as NUI gradually
closed the gap, from _ of a length
to _ a length, to _ of a length... But
could they hold on? The wait for
the final verdict was agonising, but
eventually it came: Victory for NUI
by 1 foot! Yes, that’s 1 foot in a 2,112
metre long course. Gutted.
Anyway, on with the drinking, and
when all our Pimms had gone, it was
on to the Barn Bar – an outdoor bar
with horrendous queues and extor-
tionate prices – but hey, it’s Henley.
What followed was general drunken-
ness, cavorting and revelry. Oh, and
Charlie fell in the river.
After the regatta most of the Boat
Club went their separate ways, but
enough stuck together to put in
a decent showing at the National
Championships in Nottingham a
couple of weeks later. A haul of 3
silver medals, in the mens Pairs,
Coxed Fours and Eights represent-
ing a good end to the competitive
season for ICBC.
Anyone interested in joining the
Boat Club, whether you’re male,
female, big, small, and no matter
how much or little experience you
have of the sport, should get in
touch or keep an eye out for post-
ers around college. For more infor-
mation contact the club captain at
captain@imperialboatclub.co.uk, or
the women’s captain at womenscap
tain@imperialboatclub.co.uk
We hope to see as many of you as
possible over the coming weeks and
months.
San Miguel, and Sangria pretty much
sum it up! There was, however, also
the small matter of a fancy dress
night, which produced some inter-
esting pictures, captured the hearts
of Spanish Grandmothers and lead
to a universal conclusion that men
should not wear hot pants!!
On this note, we thought it best
to escape to Valencia, where we
focused our mind on the task ahead;
which was to wow the Spanish hock-
ey players with our supreme on-
pitch skills. Unfortunately, despite
acclimatisation training one June
evening in Putney, nothing could
prepare us for running around mid-
afternoon in 35º heat! The Spanish
proved to be better adapted for these
conditions and despite some bril-
liant play by all the IC Tour Teams,
the Valencians emerged victorious.
In spite of the sun stroke and not
winning the matches, a couple of
good days of hockey were had by
all, and most of us left the pitch
content and in search of an evening
of refreshment. JLo on the other
hand, left with a school girl’s mobile
number and Shiv Henn left with a
hole in her leg. But it was all good!
Honest!!
When we weren’t playing hockey
in Valencia, we occupied ourselves
with more beach action, mini tours
of the old town, market, and walks
along the river bed, as well as once
again relishing the opportunity to
expand our scientific selves… The
City of Science managed to draw us
in and make us think about Genetics
and aeronautics again! There was,
however, the added bonus of a rath-
er nice aquarium, complete with
Dolphin Show to capture our atten-
tion and prove that learning really
can be fun!
The nightlife of Valencia also
turned out to provide its fair share
of entertainment; once again
Sangria, San Miguel and Sangria
applied, with the addition of a bit of
Zambucca, and what started off as
some pretty good nights out turned
into excellent nights out, with the
realisation that there were no hot-
pants on men in Valencia, and that
dancing on bars is a near-manda-
tory night-time activity!
It was certainly a sad moment
when this year’s Spain Tour had to
end, and the Tour Family dispanded,
but 26 IC hockey players started
their summer hols on a high and
only need to glance at the photos
on the website to burst into fits of
giggles, which is a sure sign that
next year’s tour has a lot to live
up to!!For more tour highlights and
