Dear miss Con,
I am very confused, and I don’t
know what to do. Last week I was
in a happy relationship with my
girlfriend from home. Now I’ve
come to uni and I’ve met someone
else. I really like this person but I
still love my girlfriend, but she’s
not here. Kissing doesn’t count as
infidelity does it??
Torn up tom
Dear torn up tom,
Does kissing count as infidelity??
Umm how about a big fat whopping
yes! Cheating is cheating whether
it’s a full blown orgy on a drunken
night out, or a tame kiss behind
the bike shed. You’re still being
unfaithful. If you’re really consider-
ing being with this other girl, you
obviously don’t care as much for
your girlfriend as you say. Unless of
course you have an open relation-
ship, which by the way isn’t really
a relationship, but I won’t get into
that one right now.
I think the best thing is to firstly
sit down and talk to your girlfriend
and see what she’s really expect-
ing. Maybe the best thing for you
both is to take a break, yes I know
that ended in disaster for Ross and
Rachel, but I’m sure you’ll manage.
Coming to uni already being part
of a relationship is never easy, as
you’re both going to be experienc-
ing new things and growing apart,
maybe these new feelings are the
first sign of that.
Dear miss C,
I’ve just moved into halls, and all is
going great, but I’m finding it very
hard to get any sleep. The person
in the room below me plays R&B
from dusk till dawn every night.
The base is driving me crazy. I’m
really little and he’s really big and
I just have no idea what to do. I’m
afraid he’ll just ignore me and eve-
ryone will think I’m a killjoy. What
do you suggest?
Sleepless in South ken.
Dear Sleepless in South ken,
Well at least if you have to kept up
all night its good music, that has to
count for something right!? Now
you mentioned that you’re really
little and this guy is huge, but I’m
sure that he isn’t going to be a
brute and yell at you and be mean.
I’m sure that if you ask him he’ll
be decent and at least turn off the
subwoofers. Halls is all about learn-
ing to live with each other, but if
you really are that scared you could
always try talking to your sub-war-
den or re-apps.Trust me though, it
will be so much better coming from
you, at least this way he won’t have
to call out the crew from back home
to have you beaten up(not that he
would).
You’re not being a killjoy; everyone
knows that a girl needs her beauty
sleep, hours of relaxation guaran-
teed to stop you from biting people’s
heads off. If you talk to them and
ask, they’ll most probably thank
you for it in the long run, anything
is better than having to put up with
a girl on the warpath due to lack of
sleep. Another way to show you’re
not a killjoy is to start a prank war,
but be warned you may end up with
more than you bargained for.
Dear miss Con,
Oh my god! I’m in a panic. My
roommate has discovered my aw-
ful secret, and so soon after we
met! She’s found my collection
of………. Mills and Boon books!
And I think she’s shown it to her
boyfriend. I haven’t spoken to her
about it yet, but I just don’t know
what to say. I need to stop her tell-
ing people. I hope she doesn’t think
I’m a weirdo.
Fearful fresher
Dear Fearful fresher,
The words ‘slightly too much infor-
mation’ come to mind. Now I can
see how this incident rates highly
on the cringe factor, but at least it
was just a soppy romance book, it
could have been so much worse.
Hey it’s not an awful secret, so you
like to curl up and disappear into
a fantasy world with tall, dark, im-
possibly romantic men, who make
women swoon at first glance.
At least you’re not some psycho-
pathic killer or part of a nudist cult,
which would be so much worse
for your roommate. They are just
books, unless of course you’re writ-
ing Mills and Boons as code for a
battery operated tool!? In which
case it’s natural and I’m sure that
you’re not the first and you won’t
be the last. Now I understand that
you’re embarrassed, but the fast-
est way for this to blow over is to
act like there is no problem, just
don’t make a big deal out of it! If she
makes a big deal out of it, just raid
her side of the room for incriminat-
ing evidence.
Dear Miss Confidentiality,
There’s this girl, I think she likes
me but I’m not sure. She’s dropped
her books on my feet six times al-
ready this week, I can’t figure out if
she’s just really clumsy or trying to
get my attention. I often catch her
looking my way during lectures,
but I can’t tell, my friends tell me
she may just have a squint. Its not
that I’m not interested, I just don’t
want to make a fool out of myself.
Shall I ask her out?
Harvey
Dear Hopeful Harvey,
Mate are you serious!? Does she
like you? Umm that would be a yes!
No questions! Do you need your
feet to be anymore bruised? Come
on, I mean how many hints can a
girl drop, she could always wonder
round wearing a sandwich board
with the words ‘Harvey I like you,
ask me out’ printed on it, but that
would be taking it a bit too far. The
poor girl has lost her grip on sub-
tlety and you’re being the standard
clueless guy.
Let me clear this up once and for
all, she likes you, she really really
likes you! No she doesn’t have a
squint; she just doesn’t seem to be
abel to tear her eyes away from you.
Your friends are either winding you
up or are as hopelessly confused
and clueless as you are. If you don’t
like her, I’d think about investing in
a pair of thick shoes as I can’t see
the book dropping ending anytime
soon. If you do like her, there is no
way asking her out will backfire,
and please do it soon and save her
before she hurts herself!!
Dear miss confidentiality,
My friend is in a long distance
relationship, and he talks to his
girlfriend on the phone a lot. Last
time he spoke to her, she said she
was on the toilet, he said it freaked
him out, is this natural?
Pee-ed off
Dear Pee-ed off,
Umm, not exactly sure what you’re
asking. Well please tell ‘your friend’
that people, no matter how gor-
geous they are, do occasionally
need to visit the bathroom and not
just to have a shower. It is only
natural. I understand that he may
have been slightly grossed out but
the answer to that is simple; ask
her to call you after she’s finished
her business, be it number one or
number two. I can understand how,
to you, your girlfriend is the most
perfect thing in the world. I’m sure
you do love her but, unfortunately
you do have to come to terms with
the fact that she is human. Unless
she is a robot in which case why is
she in the bathroom she may short-
circuit!
Dear Miss Conﬁdentiality...
Hi kids, I’m here to help you with
all the worries you might have
about life at uni and beyond.
Please don’t hesitate to email me,
