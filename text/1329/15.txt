S
o no one took my advice! The
Saturday night ‘Mingle’ was a
prime example of Imperial’s
downfall. The event had all the
right settings for a fantastic time,
but as always everyone got over
excited and ridiculously drunk and
crowded round the closest female
present. Again the intake of women
was poor, but we were not really
expecting anything else! This is
Imperial College of Science and
Technology!
However one attractive female
was spotted sporting a rather
eye-catching yellow top (first year
medic). But, The Union was rather
dark at the time. I am keeping my
fingers crossed…I should have your
number by the time this article is
printed so guys don’t bother.
It is not often that you get told
that you are biggest, but it actually
happened to me recently. I met an
extremely attractive girl and one
thing led to another, and being in
a whirlwind of attraction we ended
up in bed together. Everything
T
he past week has been a
hectic one in the wonderful
world of Stormy. Not only did
I win Ebay tickets to see my sec-
ond favourite boy band of all time
(nobody beats Take That), but I also
got to spend time with my newest
crush (and no, it’s not the drummer
from Hoochie Coo, that’s old news!),
the lovely Miss A.
Another girl(!), you say?
Indeedly, as the good Mr Flanders
would say. Girlie crushes are a
feature of my life I don’t often
discuss. After all is said and
done, I can’t treat them with the
respect I’d like. Who would want
to sign the lady she loves up to
life in a hostile family environ-
ment? Mummy and Daddy Woods
would not be impressed, as they
are acutely homophobic when it
comes to their own kids. What
would the elders at temple think?
Culturally conservative efforts
do not impress me; a tradition
may have worked for the past
6,000 years, but it shouldn’t be
immune to questioning/altera-
tion to make it relevant in this
enlightened age. The whole thing
smacks of hypocrisy when my
religion itself is supportive of all
committed loving relationships
between consenting adults!
Unfortunately, due a Nine West
habit thats left me in finacial hell,
I can’t afford not to live under my
parent’s roof if I’m going to have
any hope of completing my degree
(those thoughts of Dr Stormy
molesting fit patients do keep me
going!). So I’ll keep to their rules
for the time being.
Either way, my crushee is going
to be around for a good few years.
We’ve already got the obliga-
tory friends in common and have
many shared interests so should
get to know each other more
intimately. Seeing her around
totally makes my day – consider-
ably more so than the district
nurses Gulix mistakenly accused
me of fancying! Fit nurses don’t
exist for starters; a good looking
woman can earn better money
hyping upcoming pop-stars or
selling over-priced property for
the dickheads in green graffiti-
stricken Mini’s. A good-looking
woman on an NHS ward tends to
be a doctor or, maybe, an occupa-
tional therapist.
was going well, and we woke up
entangled in each others arms,
she looked angelic in the morning
sunlight. We lay there exchanging
words, and then out of the blue
came those words everyman wants
to hear.
“You’re the biggest I have ever
slept with”
Wow! I almost exploded! I que-
ried her big headedly…..
“No seriously I’m not that big”
“Yeah you are the biggest guy I
have ever slept with”
I was grinning like a Chesire cat,
compliments are always great and
I had to hear it again!
“But am I really that big?”
“Seriously your the fattest guy I
have ever slept with”
My jaw dropped, it was not what
I was expecting. I gathered her
clothes and chucked her out. We
have not spoken since.
The only way to solve this prob-
lem…shag fat chicks!

Sports facilities
at Imperial had
been little better
than those you’d
expect at sixth-
form college.

Free sport
It’s about time sport was regarded
with some importance by Imperial.
Up until now the sports facilities
at Imperial have been little better
than you would expect at a half-
decent sixth-form college, not the
third best University in the country.
The old sports centre was simply
disgusting and even when I felt like
being active I was soon persuaded
against it by the smell. Seriously,
though the new centre does look
excellent, and it makes us feel a lit-
tle more loved by College.
The decision to make gym and
swim free is particularly welcome
at a time when being a student is
becoming more and more expen-
sive.
However, I am a little worried
that the centre will be full to burst-
ing all the time. When something is
offered for free everyone wants to
get their ‘money’s worth’ from it.
Neil Mosley, has stated that they
will constantly review usage pat-
terns and there is the possibility
that we will have to book just to use
the gym.
What about sport centres at other
campuses? It seems strange to me
to continue to charge for the gyms
at Charing Cross, Hammersmith
and Silwood.
The students at these campuses
do not have access to the new
‘state-of-the-art’ equipment, and
they will have to pay to use inferior
equipment.
One could be cynical and suggest
that Imperial’s sudden interest in
sport is a result of the inclusion of
BUSA points in university league
tables.

W
ell, well we finally meet
again. You might be cursing
London buses for not run-
ning me over or nature for not com-
pletely destroying Portugal while
I was there. After a three month
break from torturing Imperial’s
brilliant minds, I’ve decided to
continue with my annoying task by
presenting you with another mas-
terpiece of literature. Diogo’s back
and more sarcastic than ever!
But, dont worry this year I’ll try
not to stereotype everyone and I’ll
raise matters of extreme impor-
tance such as international politics,
health and social welfare or reli-
gion!
Almost got you! Unfortunately, my
IQ isn’t up to the task, so I’ll stick to
sarcasm and irony.
The top five things I hate about
London.
1. Alcohol – How do you guys get
drunk in this country! I went to the
pub the other day for a Barcardi
and coke. 25ml of a 20%ABV drink!
I would need two litres of vodka to
get even slightly tipsy!
2. Timetables - how on earth can
you have lunch between 11.30 and
12.15, have dinner at 6pm, go out at
9pm and come back at 2am? Looks
like you have shifted your daily
schedule by 4 hours!
3. Prices! - I pay more per week
for a room than my government
spends yearly on healthcare.
Everytime I go shopping I try not
to burst out crying like a baby while
thinking about my future as beggar
on Oxford Street.
4. Imperial Measures - Miles,
pints, feet, inches, driving on the
left! Thanks to your gigantic British
ego I saw my life flashing before my
eyes while crossing the road last
week. It’s hard to go to uni while
dodging double-decker buses.
5. Handshakes – What’s wrong
with kissing someone on the cheek?
You can’t get malaria or typhoid
by being affectionate! Why do you
shake hands with fit girls/guys
when you could rub your face next
to their perfect skin and think at
least for a moment: I am the big-
gest pimp in the world!
