LIVE REVIEWS
“Are there drums?” he asks hope-
fully. I shake my head ruefully
remembering our last musical out-
ing to see The Engineers (he fell
asleep, dressed in his tux from the
night before). Perhaps in retrospect,
Mirah’s acoustic “lo-fi indie pop”
gig, might not be the place to take
one’s Rock and Roll Drummer.
It seems these days that the grow-
ing nomenclature of the music world
seems to make things harder and
harder to classify. “Lo-fi indie pop?”
Mirah, Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn.
Kingdom: Indie, Phylum: folk,
Species: Acoustic female. Coming
from an “artistic” (hippy) Jewish
Philadelphia background, Mirah
started with a jazz band and then
went solo. Having working with The
Microphones, she released her first
album in 2000, followed by another
four solo album/collaborations with
C’mon Miracle being the latest that
she is here to promote. Busy girl.
She arrives onstage, regrettably
drummerless but accompanied by
an accordion player with a beard on
the run from ZZTop and plunges into
Jerusalem, a sweet, if slightly naive
track from the new album. With
two guitars backing up the accor-
dion, she’s high-pitched, sweet and
breathless; “I let you have it,” she
laments during Cold Cold Water.
With the pure guitar songmanship of
Suzanne Vega, Mirah’s voice is more
youthful, without the sultry purr,
more sensitive than sexual. A few
more lyrically based songs and she
finishes with Dogs Of Buenos Aires,
another one off C’mon Miracle, an
upbeat ballad of heart break “under
this Argentina sky.”
Simple and pleasant, Mirah’s live
performance was a stark contrast to
the two bands (Hands On Heads &
Les Georges Leningrad) that came
on afterwards. Thankfully we’d had
a few bottles of wine by then and
most of what I wrote about them is
illegible, the general theme seeming
to be art school bollocks of fashion
and noise over talent, beautifully
exposed by Mirah’s honest poignant
craft.

Bearing in mind that mere hours
before setting off to see The
Offspring – the band to whom I lost
my CD-buying virginity back in 1994
– I had both managed to permanent-
ly delete my entire dissertation from
the heap of junk I call a computer
and also witnessed a nasty incident
involving a man, a wallet, and a
thief on my bus, I was needless to
say less than in the party mood.
But immediately upon entering the
Academy, greeted by chanting and
general teenage overexcitement, I
found myself getting that “nervous
yet thrilled yet pretty sure this is
gonna hurt” feeling I haven’t had in
a long while; disappointment was
not on the cards.
In a re-working of the classic
opening to the album Smash, that
slow American drawl came over the
speakers this time not telling us to
relax but to “Tear s**t up,” and what
could provide the perfect sound-
track for such an activity? Why, Bad
Habit of course. But it was only after
the near perfect succession of epics
All I Want, Come Out And Play and
Gone Away, each getting an approv-
ing roar upon their distinctive open-
ings, that I remembered that this
is a band touring for a greatest hits
album. Tonight there was no self-
indulgence, no songs you had to
struggle to remember, no messing
around; just an hour and a half of fin-
ger-pointing-manic-jumping-voice-
wrecking-exhausting-massive fun.
In addition to this The Offspring
is a band that knows how to make a
fan feel special. Dexter and Noodles’
promise that we are the best crowd
they’ve ever had is almost believa-
ble and we’re rewarded with golden
oldies like Smash and a sprinkling
of the less offensive newer offer-
ings in the shape of Americana and
Staring At The Sun. By the time the
predictable encore of Self Esteem
rolls round it is not only the icing but
the hundreds and thousands, cher-
ries and whipped cream on the cake
of a wholeheartedly energetic, dare
I say it, polished-been-in-this-busi-
ness-for-years-so-we’ve-cracked-
the-formula performance.
No trendy a**holes here, just for
me (please excuse the gushing), the
most fantastic gig of this decade.

What can you do in 15 minutes?
Watch half an episode of Friends?
Listen to a third of your favour-
ite album? Read this week’s edi-
tion of Felix? Well if you’re the Foo
Fighters you can sell out a gig at
the Astoria, virtually melting down
the ticket booking system in the
process. It’s rare for a band as big
as the Foos to play a venue as small
as the Astoria, especially when they
can sell out arenas like Earls Court
(where they’ll be playing two nights
this December) without breaking
sweat. Then again, this is no ordi-
nary gig. Not part of a scheduled
tour, it’s been billed as a “secret”
warm-up gig for their appearances
at the Carling Weekend, which is
why the two thousand fans crammed
into the venue anticipate something
truly special.
After a distinctly unimpressive
support set from Death From Above
1979, Dave Grohl & Co. stride on
to a rapturous welcome. Then the
official “nicest guy in rock” tells the
excitable crowd that they will play
some of the songs that they don’t
normally play before the band rip
through album track Hell off their
latest album, In Your Honour. It’s a
performance of real power and pas-
sion and really shows that the band
aren’t going to treat this as simply a
“warm-up” gig.
The next 105 minutes is a lesson
in how rock gigs should be done.
While the band are a tight and finely
tuned unit clearly at the top of their
game musically, Grohl gives a mas-
ter class in how to work an audi-
ence. He constantly professes his
love for Reading Festival claiming
it to be the best in the world. A few
songs into the set, after the epic My
Hero, Grohl jokes to the audience
that during the last song he sang so
hard he threw up in his mouth and
urges the sweaty audience to do the
same for the next song. They may
be well worn crowd pleasing tactics
but Grohl has the ability to make
you believe him anyway with his dis-
arming charm. Highlights from the
set which took songs from all five of
the bands albums included a short
rendition of recent Oasis single Lyla
which the Foos covered earlier in the
week for BBC Radio 1 and a brilliant
solo version of Everlong, but argu-
ably the best was saved for last. The
three song encore featured album
track Cold Day In the Sun which
features drummer Taylor Hawkins
on vocals. The song saw him move
to the front of the stage and pick
up a guitar with Grohl taking up
residence behind the drums. It was
a moment which made you remem-
ber how awe inspiring Grohl is with
drum sticks in his hands instead of
a guitar. More surprisingly though,
it made you realise that Hawkins
has been learning a few tricks from
Grohl and actually does convince as
a guitar playing front man despite a
rather awkward stance.
After closer All My Life the Foos
leave the stage with Grohl grinning
from ear to ear, and why shouldn’t
he? Clearly not all nice guys finish
last.
