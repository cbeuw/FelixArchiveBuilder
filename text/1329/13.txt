R
evolver has been dissed
left and right by crit-
ics everywhere (even
Felix). What does Guy
Ritchie have to say to
about his disaster of a movie?
Where did the inspiration for
Revolver come from?
It was a culmination of concepts
really, but a germ got stuck in my
mind about one particular concept:
the con of all cons. I’m fascinated
by how you can trick the mind and
the individual, and this concept
was so audacious, so radical, that I
was attracted to say the least. The
formula of the con is quite simple
– you seduce people by their own
greed. We can all be conned but
at what point do we realize that
we’re being conned, and to what
extent do we actually allow our-
selves to be conned? There was a
famous book called The Big Con,
which works on the formula that it
is impossible to con an honest man.
I was attracted to that idea too. The
great challenge then was to take an
intellectual concept and clothe it
in an exciting, action-packed narra-
tive because concepts are not nec-
essarily interesting to look at. It’s
important that the film delivers on
an entertaining level. What you want
in the cinema is entertainment but
I like to be intellectually titillated
while being sensorially stimulated.
It took me three years to write this
film whereas Snatch took me three
months. Fundamentally, it’s not a
very complicated film – it’s actually
quite simple – but to clothe it within
a narrative was quite complicated.
The film opens with Jake Green
getting out of jail. Would you say
that it ends with him enjoying
another kind of liberation?
The film starts off with a jailbreak
and ends with a jailbreak because
all the skulduggery going on inside
his head didn’t allow him to know he
was still incarcerated. That’s what
the film is about: the ultimate jail-
break and the radical actions one
needs to undertake to liberate one-
self from this jail. It tells the story
of the skulduggery and head-trick-
ery that accompanies Jake on his
journey, and the seemingly unlikely
actions our hero has to undertake to
break out of his jail.
Why did you call it Revolver?
I’ve always been surprised that
no other movie has ever been called
Revolver because it just sounds
cool. So I like the name but I also
like the concept that, if you’re in a
game, it keeps revolving until you
realize that you are in a game and
then maybe you can start evolving.
The film is based on the formula of
a game: where does the game start,
where does it stop and who’s con-
ning who.
A ‘Revolving’ discussion
Guy Ritchie attempts to explain himself
Is it a film with a message?
A central idea is that there is no
such thing as an external enemy.
Jake Green is playing against Jake
Green. That’s quite a hard concept
to get your head around initially: of
course, if there is only an internal
enemy, he wouldn’t want you to get
your head around it. So it’s based
on the formula that you can only get
smarter by playing a smarter oppo-
nent. Who is the ultimate opponent?
Yourself. Then comes the principle
that your enemy will always hide in
the last place that you would ever
look. The last place you would look is
inside your head and the last place
you would look inside your head
is behind fear. I’m not saying that
formula’s correct, it’s just a formula
and I’m interested in formulas. In
this particular instance, the only
opponent Jake Green has to chal-
lenge is himself by doing exactly
what he doesn’t want to do.
To that extent, are his experiences
an allegory for life?
It’s strange: I never expected as
a writer-director to end up talking
about high-falutin’ concepts. I got
into film production because I was
interested in making entertaining
movies, which I felt there was a lack
of. Jake Green isn’t just Jake Green.
Jake represents all of us. The colour
green is the central column of the
spectrum and the name Jake has all
sorts of numerical values. All things
come back to him within the film’s
world of cons and games. Jake’s on
a journey of how to play the game.
He’s very good at playing games and
he’s done very well out of playing
by a certain formula but he didn’t
realize how big and consistent that
formula is. He only saw the formula
in its microscopic form and didn’t
realize that it could be macroscopic.
Of the various formulas that make
up the rules of the game, do you
have a favorite?
I suspect my favorite line is, “You
can only get smarter by playing a
smarter opponent.” My next one
would be, “The greatest enemy will
hide in the last place you would
ever look.” The third one would be,
“The harder the battle, the sweeter
the victory.” My fourth would be,
“Always protect your investment”
which would become, “Always pro-
tect your investment whether it’s in
your interest or not.”
Chess is a prime example...
The rules in chess are consistent
with the rules of all cons. I like the
idea that the characters could all be
different pieces on a chess board. I
think we all embody the attributes of
pawns, bishops, knights and castles,
kings and queens. It’s just a ques-
tion of, do we decide to be a pawn, or
do we decide to be a queen? I didn’t
choose to be the latter particularly,
but there are different aspects to
our personality and nature that the
chess board represents, which is
maybe why chess is such a popu-
lar and ancient game. I’m a very
bad chess player, by the way. Jason
Statham has probably been blowing
his own trumpet about what a quali-
fied chess player he is. In fact, he’s
an appalling chess player.
And the fact that the face-off
between Jake and himself, his
internal enemy, takes place on the
13th floor?
The elevator starts at 32 and stops
between 14 and 12. In America,
buildings still don’t have a 13th floor.
13’s a curious number. Quite how
it got its unpopular reputation is a
mystery and one I would quite like
to have solved. Mythologically, it’s
the luckiest number; it’s the number
of liberation. From a point of view
of Jake’s incarceration, what bet-
ter place to liberate yourself than
floor 13, which doesn’t even exist
in an elevator? It just seemed like
the perfect environment in which
to meet your demon. A number that
doesn’t exist that is also the number
of liberation.
That scene is one of the most
impressive in the whole movie...
It’s my favorite scene in the film
and I actually shot it three times.
It initially had four lines written for
it. When we got in there, we spent
two hours messing around, trying
to draw as much as I could out
of Jason. I realised we’d got into
something that was very interesting
and in the end I could probably have
filmed 45 minutes of him screaming
at himself in there.
How did you create that transat-
lantic atmosphere? Did you use a
lot of special effects?
Unlike my previous movies, there’s
quite a lot of studio work on this one
because of the very nature of the
fact that I wanted an environment
that’s transcontinental. Because
of that we had to revert to green
screen. I don’t care whether I use
special effects or not. My principal
job is to make interesting and enter-
taining films, and I’m not proud of
which format or which particular
technique I use. I just wanted the
film to look good and that was about
the only request I had of my DP
.
We wanted it to be slightly over the
top in terms of photography. What I
liked about American movies when
I was a kid was that they’re sort of
larger than life, and I think I’m still
suffering from that reaction. Tim,
the DP
, was completely unbridled by
me. The cheekier he got, the more I
applauded him. He’s his own boss in
that department.

So you don’t fit the stereotype of
the dictatorial filmmaker?
If somebody has a better idea than
me, I’ll take it if it surpasses what
we have on the page because at the
end of the day, it’s me that takes the
credit anyway! I’ve been working
with lots of these guys for ten years
now and I’ve become very aware of
how much the team has to do with
the creative process. I’m not under
too much of an illusion of how smart
or un-smart I am because filmmak-
ing ultimately is about teamwork.
I enjoy the process and I’ve usu-
ally done quite a lot of preparation
before I arrive on set so I’m not a
touchy filmmaker and I’m not an
anxiety-ridden filmmaker, at least
while I’m shooting the film. If you
enjoy things, it tends to quell your
negative traits.
You’ve also worked with Jason
Statham on almost all your
films...
Apart from the fact that I don’t

like him, don’t trust him and have
no respect for him as a chess
player, Jason and I work quite well
together. Actually, Jason forced me
into using him. He threatened me
with violence. The rest of the cast I
have more affection for. André was
a pleasure to work with. In fact,
95% of the people in my films have
been nothing less than a pleasure
to work with. That goes for Jason,
too. I like him and because I like
him, it’s much easier to work with
him. He’s a very capable actor and
he embodies what I want to see
when I go to the cinema. I’ve been
a big fan of Ray Liotta’s for a long
time and been desperate to use him
in something. He wasn’t very keen
about being put into spandex pants
and Speedos but once he got into the
spirit of things it was hard to get him
out of them.
Hmm...and I thought his internal
enemy scene was lame but oh well,
judge it yourself if you must!
