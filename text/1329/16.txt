David Hasselhoﬀ wants you...
So, unless you’ve happened to have been
living in a cave for the past year, or you’re
a fresher, you can’t fail to be unaware
of the sexual phenomenon that is David
Hasselhoff’s Coffee Break.
However, for those of you who’re una-
ware, or maybe a little slow, here’s a recap
of what’s going on.
FUCWIT stands for Felix Ultimate Coffee
break Weekly Issued Tournament, and is
our weekly quiz section. Let’s explain what
you need to do:
1. Find some friends, preferably ones
with an in-depth knowledge of late eighties
WWF and the films of Rick Moranis.
2. Think of a hillarious team name, the
more pun-tastic the better.
3. Get a Felix. Not hard, they’re every-
where.
4. Work out the answers to our ‘hillari-
ous’ questions.
5. Send your answers to coffee.
felix@imperial.ac.uk
6. Receive points for your correct
answers, and earn your place in the incred-
ible league of FUCWITs.
7. Do the same again next week
8. And the week after that...
9. And after that too...
10. Eventually, collect your amazing prize
Sounds easy yeah? Well it is, so send
those emails now!
So... What the FUC is FUCWIT? Hoﬀ has twice as many friends as you ever will
So, you’re about to finish
Freshers Week and beginning
to settle down into normal
university life. No longer will
your evenings be spent explor-
ing the uncharted territories
of London’s seedy underbelly.
No, instead you’ll be spending
far too much time in halls.
Living in halls will be a new
experience for a lot of you, and
is one of the defining aspects
of your time at university.
Therefore, it’s pretty impor-
tant to make the most of it.
If you’re unlucky you’ll have
been thrown together with
roomate. More often than not
our oh-so-wise hall wardens
decide to match up com-
pletely incompatible people
in some misguided effort to
widen social horizons. Though
I’m certain that there are ex-
alcoholics out there who’ve
changed their wicked ways
thanks to their roomates intro-
ducing them to the joys of late-
night study, and that there’s
ex-geeks who just can’t get
enough of Cheapskates, but
it’s not common.
But of course, you don’t have
to spend all your time with
your roomate, especially when
there’s another hundred or so
people to piss off instead.
Unlessyou’reboring,staying
in halls should be about having
a good time with people who in
real life you would never have
anything to do with. By now
you should be past the ini-
tial ice-breaker stage (“What
were your A-Levels again?”)
and onto actual terrifying
conversation and socialising.
Now’s the time for prooving
just how cool you are, and as
everybody knows, the ultimate
barometer of cool is The Hoff.
Guess Who
Do you hate Coffee Break? You think you can do better? Well, I'd like to see you try...
We’re always looking for writers and Contributors here at Felix, and Coffee Break is no exception. If you think you can do better (and it’s not hard) send us an
email at coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk. If you’d prefer to just send us insults and complaints, they’re welcome too.

Hail to The Chief, Our
first picture is a VIP
, but
not the sharpest knife in
the drawer.
There’s something
about this girl, that we
just can’t quite put our
finger on.
It’s a mirror image of
what was one of the
most popular royals. Not
hard.
Despite living on a diet
of babyfood, this hero
managed to keep law
and order in Detroit.
Abiteasymaybe... here’s
an ‘innocent’ musician,
and allround freak.
The Hoff’s arch rival,
ex-Bouncer, Mercenary,
Boxer and Wrestler. Well
it’s not hard is it?
A cuddly old uncle on
one of Britains best
loved sitcoms. During
the war...
Even though he almost
single-handendly killed
Batman, he’s still acting
today.

Hear we have an ex-
boxer / kitchen innova-
tor in disguise. Can you
guess who?
The first FUCWIT quiz of the year
is Guess Who, which is basically a
retardedly simple guessing game.
All you have to do is tell us who
these nine celebrities (who’ve been
cunningly disguised) are. There’s
three points on offer for each cor-
rect answer.
If you’re struggling, here’s a clue.
We have two VIPs, four actors, a
sportsman, a musician, and one
which can only be described as
‘Other’.
As always, the answers and
scores will be revealed in a cou-
ple of week’s time. Emails, with
answers and hillarious team
names, should be sent to coffee.
