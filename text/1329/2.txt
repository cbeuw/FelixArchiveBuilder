Muslim are soft targets
“What is an extremist? Am I an
extremist? I’m Muslim. Everyone is
telling me that this is fine. If I were
old and wise I would remember the
early 1950s, a time when every loyal
member of the United States would
execute their patriotism by making
sure that no slither of socialism
was present in their family, friends,
neighbours and in fact anyone they
knew.” Page 14 u

Demo Reviews: New
music – we love it
“Are you sick and tired of hearing
that the only things that Imperial
guys can hold onto are their cal-
culators? And that our sense of
humour leaves a lot to be desired?
I am. ” Page 11 u
How frogs could help

How do you know that an Imperial
student is turned on? You use detec-
tion equipment!
TV Licensing tells students there’s
nothing funny about being caught
without a licence. It is the beginning
of the University year, and for many
students starting at Imperial, the
start of a whole range of new expe-
riences; including organising their
finances and paying their own bills.
However, TV Licensing is offering
students some good(ish) news: if
they buy their TV licence before the
end of October, they may be egilible
for a refund of over £30 at the end
of the year. Students could use the
cash to buy a budget airline round-
trip ticket for that end of studies
break.
All students who use or install tel-
evision equipment, such as PCs with
broadcast cards, set-top boxes, DVD
or video-recorders, to receive or
record television programme serv-
ices, are legally required to have a
TV licence.
Nicky Barrett, Student Campaign
Manager for TV Licensing said:
“Being caught without a TV licence
is no joke, which is why we’re urging
Imperial students to get a licence
now”. She told Felix that “Enquiry
Officers and detector vans are going
to be checking up on student univer-
sity accommodation throughout the
UK, so students should seriously
think about getting a TV licence now
so they can avoid a fine.”
Last year, TV Licensing caught
an average of over 1,000 licence fee
evaders each day. If caught, stu-
dents could risk a trip to court and a
fine of up to £1,000, plus court costs.
They will also still have to get a
licence if they need one. A colour TV
licence currently costs £126.50.
Students can easily purchase their
licence online at www.tvlicensing.
co.uk/students and choose from a
number of ways to pay, including
Direct Debit. Currently, over 12 mil-
lion customers pay for their colour
TV licence by Direct Debit.
If you purchase your TV licence in
October 2005, and you don’t need it
for July, August and September 2006,
you could be eligible for a refund of
£31.62. Veronica King, NUS Vice-
President Welfare said: “Students
have never been poorer and every lit-
tle helps. Call TV Licensing as soon
as possible to make sure you will be
able to apply for your refund.”

many easy ways to pay and
concessions available visit www.

Rising sea levels and unpredictable
weather are not the only dangers
posed by global warming. Scientists
this week warn that viruses frozen
in ice for thousands of years may
thaw and be released into a commu-
nity unequipped to combat them.
Few, apart from American politi-
cans deny the potential environment
problems posed by global warming.
The research, including the increas-
ing snowless season are indusput-
able.
Now this new fear, of release of
age-old viruses against which we
will have no natural defences, adds
increased emphasis to the global
warming issue.
Scientists believe that during the
freezing process, organisms such
as fungi, bacteria and viruses may
have been incorporated into the ice
sheets. As ancient glaciers and ice
sheets melt, illnesses and viruses
could potentially be unleashed. Not
only humans, but other animals,
plants and marine creatures are
susceptible to the release of such
organisms.
Geoffrey Smith, head of the virol-
ogy department at Imperial College
London routinely “keeps viruses at
minus 80°C, when we want to store
them... so viruses can certainly sur-
vive freezing”. However, he explains
that not all viruses are functional on
freezing, as they are “often fragile to
processes such as freeze-thaw”.
The Careers Advisory Service has
introduced two new initiatives for
the coming year.
JobLive is a new web based
searchable database of vacancies
aimed specifically at Imperial stu-
dents and graduates. Registering
with the system allows you to input
a profile of the type of vacancy you
are interested in, industry sector,
type of job and geographical area.
You will then receive email alerts
every time a new vacancy is added to
the database. Opportunities include
full time graduate jobs, placements,
internships, work experience, vol-
untary work and casual/part time
jobs. In addition there is a search-
able employer directory allowing
you to research details of poten-
tial employers. Go to www.imperial.
ac.uk/careers to find out more.
Engineering Career Fair
On 19 October Imperial College
will hold its first ever Engineering
Career Fair. It will be held from
11.00am to 15.00pm in the Tanaka
Business School Foyer and the
Mechanical Engineering Foyer
With 30 stands taken this is a great
way to find out more about opportu-
nities in engineering across a wide
variety of engineering disciplines.
Students from all year groups are
welcome to attend.

NZ University
takes student
newspaper to
court
Victoria University has won a
court order stopping publication
of Salient, the university’s student
magazine. Wellington High Court
issued an injunction on Friday in an
attempt to prevent the publication
of a proposed article on student fees
next year. The matter arose when
Salient contacted the university to
discuss documents it had received
detailing student fees for the com-
ing year.
Emily Braunstein, Salient Editor,
described the move as “ridiculous
and absurdly extreme measure. The
university is making decisions that
affect students enormously and is
trying to sweep it under the carpet.
We just don’t think that’s fair. The
stupid thing is all they’re doing is
creating (more) hype.”
A university spokesperson said
the university was forced to take out
the injunction as Salient “had docu-
ments they were not entitled to have
in their possession”.
Braunstein is said to be planning
to stick posters up around the cam-
pus telling students that Salient
hadn’t been printed because “the
Vice-Chancellor doesn’t want you to
read what’s in it”
Correction
In last week’s Felix, No 1328, in
‘Students UNITED in worry’ we
stated that Holloway Prison was
a stone’s throw from Piccadilly
Court. In fact, the prison is
Pentonville.
