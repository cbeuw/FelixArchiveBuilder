frogs. Her expertise lies in
genetics, his, in the biol-
ogy of transport proteins.
Although they work in
very different fields, Dr Deborah
Goberdhan and Dr David Meredith
occupy neighbouring labs and share
an office at Oxford University’s
Department of Human Anatomy and
Genetics. Two years ago, a chance
encounter in the tearoom sparked
a unique collaboration that came of
age in May with the publication in
Development of a paper that opens
up new treatment possibilities for
cancer and diabetes.
The molecule linking these two
apparently distinct diseases is insu-
lin. Most people know that diabe-
tes stems from the body’s inability
to produce or respond to insulin to
use sugars. Less well-known is that
insulin is also a key stimulator of cell
growth. Research has shown that
many different types of tumour cell
are abnormally sensitive to insu-
lin. With her 1998 discovery that
a gene called PTEN (pronounced
P-10) keeps cell growth in check,
Goberdhan offered an explanation:
PTEN controls how sensitive cells
are to insulin and is mutated in near-
ly all human cancers.
A feverish search for other genes
involved in insulin-dependent growth
ensued. Many have been found, but
none offer the treatment potential
of Goberdhan and Meredith’s recent
find. They have identified a class of
aminoacidtransportersuniquelyable
to enhance a cell’s response to insu-
lin and drive growth. Transporters

are channels that sit in the mem-
brane of a cell and move molecules
across; amino acids are the building
blocks of proteins. Explaining what
is so special about these transport-
ers, Goberdhan says, “They are par-
ticularly attractive because they can
act at the cell surface, which makes
them more amenable to treatment
with drugs or changes in diet”. It
is not inconceivable that a future
cancer patient could alter his protein
or fatty acid intake to slow down the
effects of his disease.
It has been known for some time
that cells’ sensitivity to insulin is
influenced by the levels of amino

acids around them, but Goberdhan
and Meredith are the first to pin-
point the transporters involved.
Guided by gene sequences known
to represent human transporters,
Goberdhan identified a set of fly
genes whose over-expression led to
dramatic growth. When Meredith
injected these genes into a frog
egg, he observed transporters of a
type whose function is unknown in
humans.
The next stage is to test whether
the human equivalents can restore
growth in flies whose own transport-
er has been knocked out. Or whether

normal fly will make it grow bigger.
Observing how the human trans-
porters function in a frog egg will
provide direct evidence of how they
manage a cell’s interaction with its
environment.
As cancer and diabetes continue
to extend their grip on the world’s
population, understanding how
these transporters regulate insu-
lin’s effects on growth may create
valuable new treatment targets.
While acknowledging that clini-
cal applications are still some way
off, Goberdhan and Meredith are
optimistic. “We’ve identified these
transporters, potential regulators of
growth, which can affect cancer and
diabetes, and we’re actually working
with a clinician at the hospital who
is currently screening these genes
in people with diabetes”, explains
Goberdhan. The researchers hope
to pursue a similar line of investiga-
tion with cancer patients. Flies and
frogs may not be the most obvious of
friends, but they are clearly a rela-
tionship worth exploring.

Tenth planet’s new moon
Astronomers have found that
the tenth planet in the solar
system has a moon at least
a tenth of its size. This will
enable scientists to determine
precisely the weight of both
celestial objects, which have
been humorously nicknamed
Xena and Gabrielle, after a
television warrior princess and
her companion.
Darwin in court
Evolutionary biology took the
stand last week as the trial of
Kitzmiller et al. vs. Dover Area
School District got under way
in the District Court. The case
was brought by 11 parents of
the 3,700-student school district
in eastern Pennsylvania who
took exception to the school
board’s decision to tell pupils
that evolutionary theory has
“gaps”.
Brain disconnects during sleep
Giulio Tononi of the University
of Wisconsin, Madison, has
found that different areas of
the cerebral cortex stop com-
municating during non-REM
sleep. Tononi has spent years
developing a theory that
equates consciousness with
the integration of informa-
tion. Communication between
regions of the cortex might
be one sign of this integration
– and of consciousness.
“Most people know
diabetes stems from
the body’s inability
to produce insulin.
Less well-known is
that insulin is a key
stimulator of cell growth”
Frogs may not be the most obvious of friends but are worth exploring.
