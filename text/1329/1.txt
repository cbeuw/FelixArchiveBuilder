When Imperial’s new ‘state-of-the-
art’ sports complex opens in January
2006 students will be able to certain
services free.
According to Neil Mosley, Head
of Sport and Leisure, Imperial is
spending more on sport than any
other British university.
Imperial staff and students will
be able to use the gym and swim
for free for the remainder of this
academic year. Imperial is the only
University in the country to offer
these services for free.
However, it is as yet uncertain
whether the centre will remain free
after the first trial year. Also the
centre may open to local residents,
who would no doubt be very keen to
use this excellent facility.
The new Ethos centre will cost
£17.5m, although some of the

expense is not sport related, the total
spend on sport is £12m. No expense
is being spared in the construction
of the centre and the equipment it
will house.
Neil Mosley believes that the new
centre “will rival, if not out-com-
pete all sports centres in the area
- public and private”. The centre will
be equipped with Fitlinxx personal
computerised fitness equipment.
This equipment will recognise you
every time you come to work-out
and set your individual program.
The centre will also house a multi-
purpose sports hall, climbing hall,
squash courts, dance studio, sports
injury clinic and juice bar. The
sports hall will be the size of five
badminton courts and will come the
National Centre of Excellence for
Badminton.
These additional facilities will not
be free to use, but will be “competi-
tively priced to encourage involve-
ment in sport”. The centre will also
offer many sport classes, such as
martial arts and aerobics.
Every user, no matter how experi-
enced, will have to undergo an induc-
tion session before they are allowed
to use the equipment. Mosley does
recognise that it will take along time
to induct all students and staff and
will be drafting in extra staff to quell
anticipated frustrations. Induction
will also cost £7.
The centre was initially scheduled
to open at the start of this academ-
ic year, but was delayed as piling
into the existing foundations of the
old 1960s centre took longer than
expected. This was compounded by
ground water flooding of the squash
courts.
Simon Matthews, Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies) said:
“This stunning building with fan-
tastic facilities will be well worth
waiting for”.

Imperial – third
academically,15th
for entertainment?

New University ratings place
Imperial third academically and
fiftteen for entertainment. What do
Imperial, Oxford, Cambridge and
LSE all have in common? According
to The Times Good University
Guide, academically they are the
top four UK Universities.
Oxford topped the league, with
Cambridgeinsecondplace,Imperial
came a close third, with 958 points
compared to Cambridge’s 983.
Surprisingly, in a separate enter-
tainemnt league Imperial has been
ranked fifteenth. LSE tops the
league, followed by King’s College
and Bath.
The league table is based on the
social services available to stu-
dents. Factors include the prox-
imity of shops, pubs, off-licences,
night clubs, discos, fancy dress
hire , pizza delivery and takeaway
outlets.
These criteria may explain why
Imperial rates more highly than
most Imperial students would
expect. Imperial is in London,
and as such is close to a plethora
of entertainment services. The
league, compiled by Yell.com, rates
all London Univeristies highly
due to ease of transportation and
access to round-the-clock ameni-
ties.
Finalist not Satsified
A Sunday Times survey judging
the satsifaction of final-year stu-
dents has rated Imperial in the
bottom ten.
The survey found that students
at campus-based Univerisities
were more satsified, including
the University of East Anglia and
Loughborough.
However, the validility of the 22-
question survey is brought into
question as many students boy-
cotted the survey. Students from
Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick and
Scottish univeristies did not par-
ticipate.
In stark contrast to the results
of the entertainment survey eight
of the bottom ten are in London.
Students widely agree that the;
extortionate rent, highcrime rates,
long commutes and the need to
take part-time jobs affected their
retrospective view of university
life.
One student, who owes £15,000
but admits the course was excel-
lent stated that; “if I were start-
ing again next September, when
students pay £3,000 fees a year, I
might go elsewhere”.
Cracking start to Freshers’ week
A new cohort of freshers’ started
at Imperial this week, and the “big-
gest piss-up of your life” got off to
a great start at the union on Satur-
day night.
Anxious young freshers started
arriving at halls of residence at
7am Saturday morning. Saturday
was doubtless spent in nervous
conversation with other freshers.
Everyone must be sick and tired
of asking/answering the standard
Rupert Neate boring questions ‘which course are
you doing’, ‘which hall are you in’
and ‘what did you get in your A-
levels’.
Saturday night was the Union’s
first oppurtunity to wow freshers
with the ‘amazing’ nights it has
planned. The experience freshers’
have this week ‘make-or-break’
for the Union. If the Union makes
a good impression this week it will
doubtless afffect their decisions on
where to go out in the future.
