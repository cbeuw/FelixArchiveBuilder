First Class mix-up
It was revealed in The Observer
last Sunday that the chances of
getting a top degree can vary by
up to 20% depending on a
student's choice of university.
Two researchers, Mr Peter
Dolton of Hull University and
Mr Malcom Bee of Oxford
Polytechnic discovered a wide
discrepancy in results which
could not be explained by either
the quality of the students
admitted, based on A-Level
At the U n i o n Finance
Committee (UFC) on January 17
cuts were imposed on the CCU's
which amount to £8,600 over the
next three years.
The three sabbatical officers
put forward proposals to reduce
the deposit account balances held
by the CCU's. This would be
achieved by two methods; first
Five Year Plan expenditure for
the CCU's would not be funded
from Central Union Funds until
1987/88 meaning that they
would have to draw on their
reserves to make the planned
purchases, and second, from
1987/88 the CCU's end of year

results, nor by the mixture of
subjects offered at different
universities.
The report concludes that each
institution bases its degree
awards on a preconception of the
appropriate proportion in each
category. The preconception
differs considerably across
universities.
Despite this pessimistic
statement IC students have no
need to fear. Following intensive
balances would be taken into
account when estimates are
placed before UFC. The deposit
accounts are funded by monies
remaining at the end of each year
from the CCU's grant from ICU
and therefore enable money to be
'carried over' from one year to
the next.
The intention is to draw the
CCU's financial proceedures into
line with those of the MSC's.
That is, to cease to have a
carryover and instead have a
contingency allocation from
which unplanned expenditure
can be made.

research FELIX has discovered
that Imperial College tops the list
of non-Oxbridge universities.
The percentage of first and
upper-second class degrees
awarded by Imperial College in
1981 was 46% compared to
40.2% awarded by Nottingham,
the closest rival. Swansea came
bottom of the list with only
20.3% of students obtaining top
degrees.

Stan Kearns, a former Southside

Mr Kearns, who left College in
1982 after many years of service,
is still remembered by older
students, who still refer to
Southside as 'Stan's bar'. -

The union tends to get some
fairly surprising people as
Officers, but looking at the
present lot there is none more
surprising than RCC chairman
Hugh Stiles. Hugh's job is to look
after the Union's recreational
clubs, which he does in the
manner of a benevolant dictator.
Clubs which step out of line are
liable to have their assets
instantly frozen by Chairman
Stiles. Greystoke, as he is
affectionately known on account
of his biannual change of clothes,
has recently become a bit of a
FELIX hack. This has caused
some difficulty since Hugh,
whose middle name is Noddy,
finds it impossible to work in
these new-fangled metric units.
To the rest of us the column is 44
mm wide, but to Hugh it's one
and twenty three thirty-seconds
of an inch.
Whenever non-members of IC
Radio appear in a broadcast
programmme the station is
required to make a ROT, or
record of transmission on tape.
When the three sabbatical Union
Officers staggered into the studio
shortly after midnight last
Monday to appear on Hugh
Southey's Spontaneous Incom-
petance show, they were either
ignorant or oblivious of this fact.
The resulting recording is
interesting listening indeed.
Unless the usual bribes are
received on time I might just be
tempted to print the words of the
song they were singing.
