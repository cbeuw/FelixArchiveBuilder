SINGLES
Flash and The Pan: Midnight
Man
In the three years since
'Waiting For A Train', Flash
doesn't seem to have
progressed very much. A very
1982 sound in fact. Pleasant
enough but certainly nothing
special. I can imagine Rod
Stewart doing this song, but I
wouldn't buy his version
either.
George Benson: 20/20
I have to admit I know very
little about George Benson's
music. I was expecting an 'In
your eyes' ballad sound, but
instead I was treated to a feast
of synth-funk. The produc-
tion, particularly the stereo-
imaging, is superb; the feel is
great. The song however, is
unmemorable.
I Start Counting: Letters To A
Friend
A typical Mute sound (ala
Depeche Mode) with lots of
keyboards and choral vocal
harmonies. This is the debut
single from Dave Baker and
Simon Leonard, and as such is
very impressive. Can't wait to
hearthe 12 inch extended mix.
Watch this band — they're
gonna be big!
The Colourfield: Thinking of
You
Well, despite my pleas, no-
one bought the first two
singles from the Colourfield. If
this one doesn't at last break
the band into the charts I shall
be most pissed off. It is the
best of what was the voice of
the Specials and the Funboy
Three, without the
depression.
BOOKS
Jobs Abroad
Working Holidays in 1985
If you want to do something
different on the cheap as well
as filling up one of those
embarassing holes on your
CV you could do a lot worse
than going on a working
holiday abroad. There are
quite a few books trying to
help you in your quest for
employment overseas. Some
are very expensive, some have
dodgy chapters on forging
work permits, and some are
rather thin. Thankfully
'Working Holidays in 1985' is
none of these. Published by
the Central Bureau for
Educational Visits and
Exchanges it kicks off with
twenty-odd pages of general
advice, and then launches into
nearly 300 pages of listings of
openings country by country,
with other useful information
such as where to get a Polish
railway ticket and how to get
in touch with the local British
consulate. The jobs range
from grape picking in France
(yawn...) to the trendy
Bulgarian work camps which
promise discussions on the
theme of East-West detente
and solidarity (whatever that
is).
Unlike most of its kind this
book c o n c e n t r a t e s on
government-run schemes and
community projects, not
c o m m e r c i a l e m p l o y e r s .
Although the pay may not be
as good, or.even non-existent,
it does mean that a 330 page
book can contain many
thousands of opportunities.
There are some jobs in the UK
as well, but for the reasons
mentioned above you might
well be better off financially if
you get a job in C&A in Oxford
Street.
Go to Collets Travel
Bookshop in Charing Cross
Road tomorrow and get
yourself an interesting
vacation. Make sure you have
a look at 'Working Holidays
1985' when you're browsing. It
may turn out to be the best £4
you spend all year.

Beverly Hills Cop
E d d i e M u r p h y , J u d g e
Reinhold, John Ashton, Lisa
Eilbacher.
Directed by Martin Brest.
Eddie Murphy is on the
crest of a wave. After 'Trading
places' and '48 Hours', two
films which set him up at least
in this country, if not in the
States, as the funniest
comedian since Richard Prior,
his reputation as much as
actor as funny-man, relies
heavily on the success of this
film.
Here, Eddie Murphy plays a
young overzealous detective,
Axel Foley, supposedly 'on
vacation' in Beverly Hills.
Secretly investigating the
murder of his companion, ex-
convict Mikey Tandino
(Jonathan Banks), and tailed
by the Beverly Hills Police
Department, Foley uncovers
the inevitable drug ring which,
after a larger shoot-out than
most, (they do things big out
there), he single-handedly
brings to its knees. What a
hunk!
Rather than being a simple
showcase for the young
comedian, 'Beverly Hills Cop',
as with the two films before it,
relies very heavily on a
substantial, although barely
credible , plot. But the drama
and the humour rarely mix.
The humour belongs exclu-
sively to Murphy, (at the
expense of the rest of the
cast), and Brest's attempt to
return to the plot tends to
break the balance rather than
tilt it. The net result is a soap
box thriller, and a poor one at
that, but interspersed by some
simply brilliant humour and
action in a variety of different
situations. Of course, after all
the pre-publicity, it's easy to
expect too much of this film,
but if you've never seen Eddie
Murphy, you'll love it. What
the hell, go see it.
