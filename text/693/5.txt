NEWS REVIEW!
HALF TIME SCORES
It's nearly half way through the academic year, so
Grenville Manuel looks at what has and has not
happened to the bigger news stories so far.
Refectories
Undoubtedly the old IC hardy
perennials have been blooming
as usual. The food, as served by
Mr Mooney, is still as awful as
ever, and true to form the
Refectories Section kicked off
the Autumn term by serving beef
as lamb (or was it the other way
round?). November saw the
stirrings of revolt in the long
suffering customers. Evidently
Dave Parry called it 'ill
conceived, ill timed and ill
worded' a motion was passed at
a UGM in early November
threatening refectory boycotts if
arbitary price increases were
imposed. Despite Dave Parry's
reservations, the pressure seems
to have had an effect and the
college has now put someone to
work on the refectory pricing full-
time in an attempt to iron out
some of the anomalies. With any
luck Victor Mooney's successor
will implement a complete review
of the*refectories system.
Residence
Another story which has kep^
student's tongues wagging since
1951 is the thorny problem of
accomodation. In fact, in six
months just about everything
that can go wrong with
something made of concrete has
gone wrong. Beit Hall has
asbestos in the doors, Evelyn
Gardens is in contravention of
Housing Regulations, the
Fremantle Hotel is being turned
into an indoor water sports
centre, Southside has had
problems with fire alarms and
flooding, and Moiitpelier had a
rent strike lasting two months.
Well, in the end the residents in
Southside and Montpelier got a
refund — those in Southside got
£13 per week if they were
flooded, those in Montpelier got
£13 for the loss of their hot water
and heating.
M E n g
Anyone on a four year
engineering course will be
pleased to know that the case for
the awarding of a M Eng has been
Advanced. In November FELIX
reported that ULU General
Council had opposed the
change, saying that it was elitist.
Well, the Engineering Board of
the University of London doesn't
agree with them, and has
endorsed the change. Now the
University of London Senate is
all that stands in the way of this
much needed change.
G r a n t s
The other piece of good news
for IC students last term was Sir
Keith Joseph's decision to not
charge student's tuition fees.
This came after a concerted
effort by students that
culminated in the so-called siege
of Westminster. However to use
a well worn cliche 'you can't have
your cake and eat it'. The back
down on the grants issue
resulted in cuts to SERC and
hence cuts to the departments.
