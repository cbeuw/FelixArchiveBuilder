Teaching Sir
Geoffery How
Sir Geoffery Howe, speaking in
College last Tuesday outlined his
role as Foreign Secretary and
described why Britain needed a
Foreign Policy. He also linked in
his previous role as Chancellor of
the Exchequer.
Talking at length about arms
control and the European
Economic Community (EEC) he
emphasised that relationships
depended on personality and
personal contracts.
Sir Geoffery stated that
'politically and economically
Europe is very important', and he
marvelled at the way the threat of
European War has been
removed.
Following his speech Sir
Geoffery answered questions on
the 'Star Wars' superiority
possessed by the USA, the
shooting by a Libyan diplomat of
a policewoman last year, and
several questions about US
involvement in South America.
Members of RCSU were banned from Keele and Loughborough
Students' Unions during the Rag Mag selling trip last weekend,
when objections were made about the sexist nature of much of the
material.
Complaints were also received from Leicester and Leeds,
where Rag Mags were thrown at RCS students. As a result of the
Loughborough ban the mag was sold as 'sexist filth from London'
directly outside the Union building.
There were, however, better receptions for the students at
Nottingham, Aston and Warwick, and at Birmingham. The four
day trip raised over £1800 and between 4000 and 5000 mags were
sold.
Fifteen universities in the North and Midlands were visited
during the four day trip.
Theft
A vending machine on level 3 in
the Huxley Building was broken
into on Sunday afternoon. The
thieves took about £50 in cash
and about £25 worth of stock.
Geoffry Reeves, College
security officer, thought it
unlikely that it was broken into
by a member of the College but
refused to rule theft by students
out. The police are investigating
the matter.
Challenge
Imperial College has drawn
Somerville College, Oxford in the
1985 University Challenge.
The rounds are filmed at
Granada T V studios in
Manchester, and our first game is
on Monday 8 March 1985.
Should the team be successful in
the match, they will stay
overnight to play again on the
next day against (the winners of
the match between Sidney Sussex
College, Cambridge and Queen's
Belfast.
A fifty seater coach will be laid
on by Granada TV to take
supporters from IC to and from
the match. These coaches will
arrive in Manchester at around
6.30pm, so a mid afternoon
departure is anticipated. Please
let Jen (Union Office) know if
you wish to go.

Hendy in
Silwood
resignation
shocker
Mr Chris Hendy, the Chairman
of ICU Council, has threatened
to resign unless the next meeting,
to be held at Silwood Park, is
quorate, it was announced after
last Monday's Council.
During the Hon See's report,
objections were raised by Carl
Burgess, Rag Chairman, and
Maribel Anderson, Guilds
President about the intention to
hold the next meeting at Silwood.
Mike Stuart, Welfare Officer, is
also considering resignation after
failing to be allowed to spend
money on rape alarms without
approval from Union finance
Committee.
Before the end of the meeting it
was noted that the Executive had
not implemented Council policy
on re-admitting Royal College of
Music students to the Union Bar
following a previous ban. This
disagreement has now been
resolved.
It was also decided that
priority of allocating Union
Rooms in Halls of Residence will,
be left to the Executive.
Unions and the media
Alan Sapper, General Secretary
of the A s s o c i a t i o n of
Cinematograph, Television and
Allied Technicians (ACTT)
spoke in College last Tuesday on
the subject of 'Unions and the
Media'. Mr Sapper covered quite
a wide range of issues including
comment on the recent
legislation regarding videos. He
pointed out that the heavy licence
fee for video tapes distribution
effectively prevents many unions
making use of this otherwise
invaluable medium. Turning to
television, he praised Channel
Four's news policy, which he said
leaves little room for biased
editing of interviews and
speeches, a feature of other
channels which has led to
controversial union action
preventing broadcasts.
After the talk the discussion
broadened to include the press
and trade union political
affiliations.
