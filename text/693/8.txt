Fortran
& Chips
You may recall that at a UGM last term IC
Union adopted policy regarding the
Refectory pricing system and the lack of a
working computer system to keep stock and
purchase records. Since that forthright
expression of student opinion the College
has not been idle!
That well known software expert, Mr
Victor Mooney, has been working round the
clock on the latest in FORTRAN IV to beat
the deadline. Whilst at the premier college of
science and technology in the country you
may not be at all surprised that people can
and do write FORTRAN programmes, the
Refectory Manager has just acquired the
very latest in vacuum-tube technology — a
steam driven abacus, code-named Deep
Thought.
Informed sources have revealed some of
the coding used (see below). As you can see,
it relies extensively on a random number
generator for menu planning, prices, and
what to call the meat this week.
Union Bar Manager Mr Norman Jardine
has denied that this is common in the
Catering Industry. He said that it is quite
easy to read the label on a package.
