There will be a reduction in the number of re-applicants
places in Halls and Houses next session in order to provide
enough rooms for first year students. This is necessary
because of the impending loss of the Fremantle Hotel,
In order to meet the guarantee
given by the College to house all
new undergraduate and overseas
postgraduate students it has been
necessary to use about fifty of the
places in the Fremantle Hotel,
which is leased by the College on
a head tenancy basis. The three
year lease expires at the end of
this session, meaning that if it is
to maintain the guarantees the
College will have to reduce the
numbers of non-guaranteed
category residents in College
owned accommodation. The
Student Residence Committee
decided on Wednesday that the
shortfall will mainly be met by
reducing the number of re-
applicants, students who spend a
second year in a Hall or House to
provide some continuity in social
life, by at least thirty. This
represents a reduction from 10%
to about 8% of places, although
the cuts may not be implemented
uniformly since Wardens are to
consider each residence
individually before final
decisions are taken.
The remaining shortfall will be
met by a combination of extra
places in College flats and
existing residences and
reductions in other categories
such as Union places, which ICU
has agreed to reduce from sixteen
to twelve for next session. It is
hoped the extra places generated
will be sufficient to avoid cutting
the, already very low, number of
home postgraduates who can be
offered places.
Evelyn Gardens
Despite the problems caused by
being compelled to carry out
work on Willis Jackson House
during term-time (reported in
last week's FELIX), the College
is not planning to carry out
similar work on the remaining
houses which will be required by
Kensington and Chelsea Council
until it is again forced to do so.
After inspections by the
Council last year a notice was
served for work to start on 69 and
64 to 66 Evelyn Gardens.
However, since all the Evelyn
Gardens houses are in a similar
condition it seems that in due
course all will require
improvemnts. The total cost is
expected to be a quarter of a
million pounds.
N
e
w locks
Electrically-operated locks are to
replace the present system of
entry to the Southside Halls of
Residence. At a cost of £2000, the
changes are as a result of
residents complaints that
excessive force is required to gain
access.
An additional change is that
doors will be altered to open
inwards instead of outwards.
Sinn Fein at IC
A me .iber of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA,
addressed IC Socialist Society in
The Lounge yesterday. John
Niland, from Essex University,
described the history of his party
from the early 1900s until the
present day. In the early sixties,
he said, the policy of Sinn Fein
had been revised from a
generalised nationalism to a
'statist' one, which visualised
three stages in the future of the
Irish peoples.
First, the Northern Irish
working class would be
mobilised by 'civil rights action',
he said, and a similar process
would follow in the Republic.
Finally, because the workers of
North and South would be
united, the bourgeois capitalist,
whom Mr Niland said were
controlling the public, would be
overthrown.
He maintained that the current
troubles are due to discrimin-
ation against C a t h o l i c
Nationalists in the North,
especially in housing and
political representation, and
were triggered by the RUC
removing a Republican flag from
a Nationalist meeting in
Northern Ireland. He went on to
describe the IRA in conjunction
with the people 'on the streets'
performing a 'police' role in
keeping the B-Specials and the
British Army out of the
Nationalist ghetto areas.
Forty-five students were
prese'nt at the meeting, including
some from other colleges.
College security chief Geoffery
Reeves was said to be annoyed
yesterday that posters
advertising the meeting had been
on show to the general public on
Exhibiton Road and Prince
Consort Road.
P
h
o
n
e
s fiasco
The new College electronic
telephone exchange developed a
major fault this week, making
outside calls impossible from
most instruments.
Callers had to route urgent
calls through the switchboard,
leading to extensive delays in
answering incoming calls.
Engineers hope to rectify the
error 'as soon as possible'.
