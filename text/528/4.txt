So the first week has nearly ended and
though you're a fresher you're not quite so
fresh a one. A s things gradually settle down
and you find you're feet, you will be able to
take a more rational look at your involvement
in the Union. I hope the answer comes out
positive.
South African Rugby Teams
In line with Union policy, I requested that
the forthcoming match between S.A. Mine
and a team including some R S M players be
not played at Harlington. College complied
with this request.
PRES(SURE!)
RELEASE
Third World Scholarship
College has now chosen a student who is
probably already here. For obvious reasons, I
feel it is up to him to decide whether his
identity be revealed. But if you haven't yet
donated to the fund, please do so.

Stay cool and hang loose but...don't freeze

IC F O O T B A L L CLUB
"Excuse me, I'd like to join the sorter club
please," said the fresher.
" D o you play football?" I boomed.
E r . y e s . " he replied " a n d t e n n i s . "
" T e n n i s eh? I used to play football, you
know. I remember one match I played, in
goal against Bedford College. Their centre-
forward broke through. H e shot with all his
might from three yards. I never had a chance
to move; couldn't defend myself. T h e ball hit
me straight between the eyes and ricocheted
away. N o w , where was I?"
" T h e ball ricocheted away" replied the
fresher.
" O h yes," I continued, "the ball ricocheted
out to their winger. A high cross came over. I
was halfway on to the ball when their centre-
forward came rocketing in a n d headed the
ball like a bullet. I never had a chance to
move: couldn't defend myself. T h e ball went
Hying over the bar for a goal-kick."
" T h i s is the IC Football C l u b stall, isn't it?"
he interjected.
"Football? A h yes. next attack their centre-
forward split our defence in two and
hammered intcj the penalty area. Ofcourse, I
came out to narrow the angle, and he
unleashed a fearful shot Irom point-blank
range-. I never had a chance to move; couldn't
clclencl myself. The ball hit me straight
between the eyes; of course I was getting used
to it by t h e n ! "
" H m , so you want to join the lootballclub?
( i n you train once a week, and play on
Wednesdays a n d Saturdays?"
" Y e s "
" R i g h t , you're i n ! "

Elections
In addition to the elections mentioned in
last week's FELIX, papers are also up for three
ordinary members of the University of
London students representative council.
Papers come down on Friday, 12th October,
and election is by ballot at the Union General
Meeting on 16th October.
Parking Permit
Just to remind you, if you need a permit and
haven't filled in the form yet, you should get
on your skateboard and rush across to the
union office. Applications close at 5:00pm
today.
Motions
The next Union General Meeting is on
Tuesday, 16th October. Motions need to be
handed into myself by Tuesday, 9th October.
After a rather quiet first U G M , do put on the
agenda motions on any topic you care about.
It doesn't have to be College stuff (but can
be!). Just come up and dump the motion on
my desk. Its best to list things under i)ICU
notes, ii)ICU believes and iii)ICU instructs.
First Week
Well, I trust you enjoyed the first week. For
me, the highlight was the Life Sciences Party
on Tuesday. See you tonight in the junior
common room and tomorrow at MarbleArch.

PS
I really am a nice individual.
