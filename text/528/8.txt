I hope that the freshers week
has been successful as far as R C S
s t u d e n t s w e r e c o n c e r n e d .
Looking ahead we have arranged
several more exciting events at
very little expense but a vast
amount of toil and sweat by the
R C S officers.
The Freshers B a r Night takes
place this Sunday in the Union
(where there is a tendency for
people not to hear you retch). A
night of gaiety and lubricated
r e v e l r y , e n j o y e d b y a l l .
The first R C S Night Out has
been arranged for Tuesday, 9th
October, and is a trip to Queens
Ice Skating Rink in Bayswater. It
will only cost about a quid. We
meet in Stan's Bar in Southside at
6:30.
Now we come to one of the
highlights of the first term - Yes.
the Freshers Dinners. Definitely
not to be missed since tickets only
cost a fiver and y o u get a good
meal, plenty of wine and beer and
won
if you buy a ticket you can go to
the Life Sciences Disco, which is
after the Life Sciences Party on
2nd November.
If there are any budding wits,
wags or serious playwrights
interested in writing sketches or
playlets for the R C S smoking
concert could you please leave a
note for Rich Archer in the
Chemistry letter rack or drop into
the R C S U sometime.
Finally nomfnations are open
for four freshers entertainments
committee members, so if y o u
want to help organise R C S
events put your name up on the
lists a n d press-gang seconders
into signing.
Don't forget also to tiddlywink
down Oxford Street tomorrow
and collect lots of notes (coins
also acceptable) to keep R C S Rag
the most successful.

After last week's marathon article and the
rigours of the first week, today's article is
slightly shorter, basically due to lack of
inspiration and being totally knackered.
Assuming you are reading this during
Friday's lectures there is still time to go to the
Tiddlywinks on Saturday, 6th October. This is
the first Rag collection of the term, so a good
turn out is essential. Meet in the Guilds' Office
at 9:30 to collect all y o u will need.
Tuesday the 9th is the Guilds' pub crawl to
Wandsworth. Turn up in the Union Bar at 6:00
for 6:30 pm to have a practice drink and find
someone to. carry y o u home when it has
finished.
Thursday is the first freshers' dinner for
Chemical Engineering, so make sure that all
yoy in Chem. Eng. buy your tickets soon, or
you may be disappointed.
On Saturday, Guilds' Ents proudly present
the Roadshow at 8:00 pm in the junior
common room. B u y the tickets in Guilds'
Office for £1 or pay £1.25 on the night. There
will be dancing, late, late bar and an all girl
rock band (sounds like fun).
