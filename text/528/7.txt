GOOD SOUNDS A T I C
THE AUDIO SOCIETY
Audio Society?
WJiat do they do?
You may well ask; I often do so, when trying
to dream up things for the committee to
organise and when attempting to satisfy the
i n s a t i a b l e d e s i r e s of the m e m b e r s .
A few years ago we were the hi-fi club, but
this was changed probably because "Audio
S o c i e t y " s o u n d s more sophisticatedA
We exist as T H E body devoted to hi-fi
sound reproduction, in whatever form this
may take. As such our activities can be
divided in to two main areas. Firstly, talks,
lectures and demonstrations which tend to be
mainly for the benefit of the members,
although everyone is welcome. Secondly,
r e c o r d i n g s of m u s i c a n d o t h e r
entertainments around college, which may
be broadcast over IC Radio and hence benefit
everyone. This latter activity, is a fairly new
one and we are still in the process of getting
the necessary equipment together; but the
future looks bright.
Our lectures are really quite diverse; in the
past we have had visits from Roger Driscoll,
an acoustics expert and lecturer, Angus
McKenzie, consultant and reviewer, and
V i d e o t o n e d e m o n s t r a t e d their newest
products to us.
Occasionally a tour can be arranged. These
have been to places of general interst, like Dr.
Driscoll's acoustics laboratory. A few of these
visits will be possible this year, details will be
f o u n d at t h e e n d of t h i s a r t i c l e .
One of the most promising things to
happen recently is our association with the
Audio Engineering Society. This is a group of
professional people involved with hi-fi who
arrange events similar to our own but with
rather greater professionalism as a result of
the greater resources available to them. Their
meetings take place on Tuesday evenings at
the Institution of Electrical Engineers, Savoy
Place, off the Embankment. We meet and go
there as a group.
Not long ago we had the privilege of
hearing Peter Walker of Q U A D give a lecture
and demonstration of the new electrostatic
loudspeaker. Still in the development stage, it
seems very promising.
Our society's forthcoming events are
envisaged to be as follows:-
First Term
Comparison of power amplifiers - the Nairn
NAP160 versus Q U A D 405, see if you can
hear the difference.
Joint meeting with the Radio Society.
Anthony Askew who works freelance often
for the B B C with their outside broadcase unit.
Videotone will be demonstrating their
latest c a r t r i d g e a n d hear a m p l i f i e r .
Paul Messenger will be coming up here
near the beginning of term. The subject of his
talk will soon be announced.
Tony Faulkner is the Recording Manager
for Enigma Records. He will be giving a
lecture/demonstration on m i c r o p h o n e
techniques. This very entertaining lecture
was presented to the A E S earlier this year.
Near the end of term we plan to have a trip
to the Q U A D factories in Huntingdon,
Cambs.
Second Term
Lectures will be given by Dr. Roger Driscoll
and Angus McKenzie. These were both very
good last year and are expected to be even
better this year.
Trip out to Audio-T. This is a very good hi-fi
retailer with plenty of facilities for
demonstrating equipment. Also lots of good
tips on pick up/arm/cartridge combinations.
Gale E l e c t r o n i c s are setting up a
demonstration studio for their products
which include a speaker and a solid glass
turntable. They are also setting up an
anechoic chamber so it might be possible to
arrange to see this.
Lentek have agreed to let us come up and
tour their factory, again in Huntingdon.
Rogers/Swisstone have a plant in Catford,
London, so we might be able to go there.
Now you know who we are and what we do
you might feel you would like to know more or
if I have said something which you do not
understand, please feel free to come up and
meet us, ask questions or whatever. Our
meetings are held on Tuesday evenings at
7:00 p.m. in ICWA. Failing that you could
contact one of the committee which for the
1979-1980 session is:-

G O L F C L U B CRISIS
In recent years the IC Golf Club has
enjoyed the privelege of being allowed a
block membership at the Royal Mid-Surrey
Golf Club. However, we have just been
informed that they are no longer prepared to
offer us this facility due to the increased
amount of course usage over the past year.
This means that we have been left in a difficult
position at the beginning of the college year
in that we cannot offer freshers any sort of
regular facilities until we find another golf
club willing to give us a block membership.
Potential IC golfers s h o u l d not be
discouraged from applying to join the club,
however, as we hope to be making some
temporary arrangements for practise games,
and have a number of matches which need
not be affected.

SECURITY
Lost Property
Every year hundreds of items of personal
property are found and handed in to the
Security Office, many of these items are
never claimed by the losers and are
eventually returned to the finders. Students
and staff who lose property should inform the
securtiy staff and in many cases the items can
be speedily restored. Persons finding items of
personal property should hand them in to
the Securtiy Office or to one of the
messengers or security guards on ,any of
messengers or security guards on any of the
buildings.
Thefts
It is an unfortunate fact of life that, on an open
campus such as this where a large number of
people are allowed considerable freedom of
access, periodical spates of stealing occur. A
good deal of this is due to 'walk in' thieves
who prey on institutions such as this. Both
students and staff are requested to co-
operate with the security staff by promptly
reporting to the Security Office any
suspicious persons seen loitering in College
buildings or entering offices or laboratories
with no apparent authority. Wallets, cash,
cheque books, calculators, slide rules and
watches are the things most commonly
stolen and they should always be carried
separately on the person as instances have
occured where heavy withdrawals of cash
from banks have been made through thieves
having obtained possession of both card and
cheque book.
Cycles
Pedal cycles are very attractive to thieves and
if brought onto campus they should be
secured to the cycle rack with a heavy chain
and stout padlock. Plastic covered cables are
little deterrent to thieves and should not be
used. If you value your cycle please insure it.
Car Parking
Unless you have been authorised to park your
car on the campus do not bring it into the
College Car Park otherwise you will
inconvenience some person who has an
authorised parking place.
Derelict vehicles are also from time to time
an embarrassment to the College and a
vehicle which ceases to be road worthy
should be disposed of by the owner and not
left on the car park where it may quickly be
cannibalised by some persons who are quick
to recognise that it has been abandoned.
Motor cycles brought onto thecampus must
be registered with the Security Office and
students are requested to park only in the
authorised parking spaces. Parking in
between motor vehicles can result in damage
to b o t h c a r s a n d m o t o r c y c l e s .
