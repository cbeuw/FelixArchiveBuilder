LETTERS
Sirs,.
May I, through the columns of
y o u r e s t e e m e d p u b l i c a t i o n
counter the pernicious anti-union
views of Frank James.
In his letter (1st October issue),
he viciously attacked our most
useful and lively organisations,
the C C U s , as being anti-
intellectual and detrimental to
the academic life of IC. I would, in
answer to this, humbly suggest
that he totally misunderstands the
purpose of a C C U , i.e., to promote
the academic, social and sporting
a c t i v i t i e s of its m e m b e r s .
I have every reason to believe
that academic affairs are very well
looked after by the C C U s , in a
manner which would not be
possible in the larger and more '
extensive ICU. Yet Mr. James
makes no mention at all of this
aspect of the C C U s .
On the sporting and social side,
he appears to condemn all
events which do not provide direct
i n t e l l e c t u a l s t i m u l a t i o n a n d
makes what I can only assume are
purely moral judgements. He
does not know the difference
(e.g. in the case of " d e c i d i n g "
smoking concerts) between" anti-
i n t e l l e c t u a l i s m a n d n o n -
intellectualism. Further I would
add that such events are, in
moderation, essential to the
academic and social development
of the student.
Above all, Mr. James censures
the C C U s for their rivalry - yet how
would he see sporting standards
(especially) maintained without
this r i v a l r y ? D o e s he see
competition as an evil thing? He
views the smaller C C U s with
mistrust and believes they should
be "nationalised into one big
impersonal ICU - but would he be
satisfied or would he continue
until he had abolished even this in
favour of membership solely to
the N U S with no variety in union
outlook and, doubtless, no variety
in higher education?
Frank James would do away
with the C C U s . N O ! They are the
lifeblood of student activity and
their faults should be made good
from within. You don't fell a good
tree when a few of its twigs are
withered.
Yours faithfully,
J A M E S G R A Y
Dear Colin,
I think serious consideration
should be given to the abolition of
Frank James (Letters, Issue no.
527).

Dear Sir,
A s is well known, there are a
number of publications printed
by, or contributed to by Imperial
College with the intention of
informing intending under-
g r a d u a t e s , l o c a l r e s i d e n t s ,
industry and the like, kthat
Imperial College exists, with the
intention of providing sufficient
information about facilities, life at
IC and so on , for a choice to be
made, or simply to improve
relations, as in the case of local
residents.
Clearly this can be counter-
productive if the information is
incorrect, so may I suggest that
College block/ICU take a little
more care in this area? In case the
reader doubts the need for this,
here is a genuine example: It came
from page III5 of "Which Degree
1979", a page devoted to details of
life at IC. Under the heading
Catering Facilities, it states that
there are
"a wide choice of College run
refectories.. ..between them
they provide an all day service
soaafcrbars, self-service cafe-
terias a n d waitress service
refectories; most students eat
lunch there.. .."
On the subject of Media we find
that
" A n n u a l U n i o n p u b l i c a t i o n s
include.. ..a U S K handbook" -
talking of which, under the title
Societies, we find that there is
apparently a
"University for South Kensington
movement."
Since that information was not
even correct in 1976, it would
seem that IC may be in an ongoing
disinformation situation. Could I
therefore suggest that either: IC
puts out correct information, or:
USK is revived and mooneys
revamped?
Yours pedantically,
Ken (gone but not finished)

Dear Colin,
I was disgusted to see how
many people were packed into
the Great Hall for the Rector's
reception. If there had been a fire
alarm, it would have been
extremely difficult to clearthe hall
in a reasonable time, i.e. before
somebody started panicking.
Yours,
Kirsten

occupants of South Side and
Linstead. In the past, theshophas

Rag's Caped Figure
This year's rag symbol, a caped
figure in tight clothing holding a
rag collection can is to appear on
pint glasses. These will be wold
during rag week, later this term.
They are expected to sell quickly.
New Kitchen Equpment
New kitchen equipment worth
over £1,000 has been installed in
Bernard Sunley House. The
equipment includes four cookers,
and ten refrigerators and has been
added to the equipment currently
in use at the House.
Cistern Overflows
College engineers were called in
on Saturday night to Keogh Hall.
A cistern had overflowed on level
2 of staircase 6, causing curtains
in the rooms below to become
rather wet.
Bedford College Sacks President
T h e P r e s i d e n t of B e d f o r d
College Union, Ruth Fitzjohn, has
been refused re-registration by
Bedford College, and has been
forced to step down from office.
The reason for their refusal was
that Miss Fitzjohn had failed to
satisfy the examiners in both her
English sessional exam last year
and the retake two months later.
B e d f o r d ' C o l l e g e U n i o n ' s
publicity officer, Dave Brown,
w h o has t a k e n o v e r M i s s
Fitzjohn's duties as President,
said that they have an agreement
w i t h the c o l l e g e that the
sabbatical post can be held only
by a person of minimum academic
standing, but he regrets that Ruth
will not be President next year.
Victory for Canoe Club
Two members of IC Canoe Club
have s c o r e d an i m p r e s s i v e
national victory for the second
year running. Bob Joce and Bob
Owen, who were British C 2
champions in 1978, have retained
the championship by winning the
Llangollen "Serpent' Tail" slalom
in Wales. The pair finished way
ahead of the rest of the field. They
are both international paddles
and B r i t i s h team m e m b e r s .
Squash Courts Out of Use
The squash courts in kthe
college sports centre will not be
able to be used until Christmas.
This is due to a fault in the
drainage system and the floor will
h a v e to be r e p l a c e d . T h e
opportunity is also being taken to
repair the walls at the same time.
Industrial Action Diverted
The proposed industrial action
b y m e m b e r s of N A L G O
threatened registration at many
British Universities this week.
However, the local branch of
N A L G O decided after a clcsed
vote not to take part in the action.
Had they taken action, many
members of other clerical unions
in College would have stopped
work in sympathy, considerably
slowing the registration process.
National Fun Run
The second Sunday Times
National Fun Run took place in
Hyde Park on Sunday. Several
thousand people jogged round
the four kilmetre long course
during the day for the event,
which transformed Hyde Park into
a cross between a cross-country
course and a picnic sit. Following
the success of last years Fun Run,
several local newspapers have
since organised similar events on
a smaller scale.
Student Railcards
British Rail are continuing their
popular Student Railcard scheme
into the new academic year. The
card, which now costs eight
pounds, entitles students to half
price rail travel on second class
single and Awayday return tickets
over two pounds and ordinary
returns over four pounds in cost.
Students may obtain railcards
from most rail stations, but need
to fill in an application form and
p r o v i d e t w o p a s s p o r t - s t y l e
photographs. The form and one of
t h e p h o t o g r a p h s m u s t be
countersigned by a tutor and
stamed at the college registry
office.
British Rail and Lloyd's Bank
have joined in a scheme which
offers 50%, or £4, off the price of a
Railcard for all first-year full-time
students who open an account
with Lloyd's Bank before 31st
October.
Railcards are also available from
the London Student Travel Office
in the lower lounge of the union
building.
