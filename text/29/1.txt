MORPHY DAY -
GUILDS' WIN MORPHY; MINES THE LOWRY.
Our Correspondent Explains
Morphy Day 1961 was memorable f o r several
reasons, not the least of whioh was the comp-
l e t e l y f a l s e predictions made by "your rowing
correspondent" i n the l a s t issue. The Morphy
Cup was well won by a much improved Guilds crew
whilst what must have been the most popular win
ever, was that of the hard-working and enthus-
i a s t i c Miners who gave the HSM. t h e i r f i r s t
victory i n the Lowry Oup sinoe that race was
i n s t i t u t e d i n 1946. -Continued on Sports Page.'

But came calamity. They s t o l e the drum.

I.C.lost the fir»t round of the inter-college
debating championships to Goldsmith's College by 65
points to 70. I think i t would be generally agreed
by most .of those present ( c h i e f l y members of Gold-
smiths) that given even the smallest support from
I.C. men and women, we might quite wiell have carried
the debate. A considerable e f f o r t w i l l be made this
year to encourage support of debates, and we hope I.C,
w i l l change i t s present scornful attitude to such
unpractical pastimes and take some part i n the pleas-
ures they afford. In addition we should be compen-
sating f o r the lack of certain f a c i l i t i e s which would
make this a College i n the more complete sense of the
I word. „ - _.

U.L.U. DEBATE
One of the beet debates of recent months
was held i n the U.L.U. Hut on 23rd November,
but although i t was comparatively well atten-
ded (as debates go), members of I.C. Union were
conspicuously absent.
The motion before the House was that "This
House believes that the f i r s t allegiance of
the creative a r t i s t i s to himself. The p r i n -
c i p a l speakers were from the Universities of
Cambridge, C a r d i f f , Dublin, St. Andrews, Shef-
f i e l d and London; and the motion was carried by
a narrow margin.
It i s a great pity that there seems to be
very l i t t l e enthusiasm f o r debating among mem-
bers of I.C. Union and even among members of
U.L.U. because i t mean's that an o l d and valuable
University a c t i v i t y i s being neglected. Debating
as we know i t has been associated with the Uni-
v e r s i t i e s f o r over a hundred years and modern
debating has i t s o r i g i n s i n the scholastic d i s -
putations p r a c t i s e d i n the mediaeval U n i v e r s i t i e s .
Other Universities have strong debating t r a d i t i o n s
and i t i s to be hoped that some e f f o r t w i l l be
made to make debating a regular part of Union
a c t i v t i t y at I.C. as w e l l as at U.L.
There i s to be one more U.L.U. debate t h i s
term on the 'Mother or Child' controversy with,
i t i s hoped, speakers from the Society of J e s u i t s
and the medical profession. Next term there
w i l l be debates on p o l i t i c s and the arts,among
other topics.

MUSICAL SOCIETY CONCERT
It i s a great honour that Dr. Reginald Jacques
should have undertaken the regular conducting of the
I.C.Choir. Dr.Jacques succeeded i n putting a p o l i s h
on the choir singing that gave real d i s t i n c t i o n to
the performance of Part I I of Bach's Christmas Oratoria.
The two s o l o i s t s , Eileen Price and Bryan Corrie, sang
i n a manner worthy of the conductor and of the occasion.
Vaughan Williams' 100th Psalm - performed by the Choir
on Commemoration Day - gained immeasureably from the
better acoustics of the Q.A.H. concert h a l l compared
with the University Great H a l l . The other vocal works
included groups of madrigals and carols, and. 'aisme
charming solos sung by Eileen Price. Of the Jacques.
Orchestra one can only say that they amply maintained
their high reputation for sensitive playing and
ensemble; p a r t i c u l a r l y i n their exquisite rendering of
a Purcell Chacony, and the joyous and vigorous perfor-
mance of Hoist's St.Paul's Suite-
