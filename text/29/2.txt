Dear S i r ,

27th. November, 1951.
I have been interested to read i n the
columns of "The Times", o f the launohing and
commissioning by the Oxford University Boat Olub
of t h e i r new t r a i n i n g ship, Leviathan.-
Cambridge, I hear, are b u i l d i n g a submarine to
enable t h e i r members to learn t o feather under
water. What S i r i s our own College, Justly
famed throughout the world f o r i t s soienoe and
technology, doing i n t h i s matter?
I trust that we s h a l l be able to devise
an answer to these seoret weapons.
I remain S i r
Your Rowing Correspondent.

VIEWPOINT- THE HOSTEL
Dear S i r ,
Your correspondent
"Scepticus" caused me a
certain amount of amuse-
ment with his a r t i c l e on
the Hostel.Here I thought
was a future President
of the Bowling Club - a
club with private chang-
ing rooms and a poker-
dice school on the f i f t h
f l o o r of what i n the bad
old days was termed the
Hostel. The p o s s i b i l i t i e s
are endless - Scepticus
has a v i s i o n !
However, when you,sir, _
proposals were not i n jest I was somewhat annoyed.
I,therefore,carefully scrutinised the viewpoint. My
annoyance melted to p i t y . Pity f o r a student who so
completely missed the object of College l i f e (which
is what his a r t i c l e primarily attacks and not solely
the Hostel). Pity for a gentleman who has so l i t t l e
f a i t h i n human nature. Pity f o r a fellow whose i n t e r -
ests are so narrow that he i s l i a b l e to "become a
brown bagger i n s e l f defence". Pity for a, s e l f appoint-
ed outcast.
For surely the main and rather broad object of
a r e s i d e n t i a l college l i f e i s to afford one an oppor-
tunity o f finding one's feet i n l i f e . Most students
come to I.C. direct from a sheltered home and school
l i f e or even from a rather unnatural service l i f e .
By entering the Hostel they obtain an excellent
opportunity to learn a considerable amount about
their fellows and, what i s perhaps more important,
about themselves. No one can deny that there i s a
back-slapping and noisy r u g b e r - t a l k i n g facet to n many
sided Hostel l i f e . Why should i t be denied anyway?
The world i s made up of a great variety of types of
whom this particular group i s one that must receive
attention l i k e the rest. Our job i s not to turn away
not-
agree with their views out we must learn to
tolerate them. This we p a r t i a l l y do by the numerous
informal discussions that take place nightly over
cups of coffee. Other opportunities are afforded
by the multitude of college a c t i v i t i e s that can more
easily be attended by the resident student.
Again, examinations give a f a i r idea of a b i l i t y
at one's studies but one needs the chance of assess-
ing one's non-academic p o t e n t i a l i t i e s . Surely i t i s
a great asset to know how others w i l l react to one's
own views and methods of dealing with people,before
venturing into the competitive outside world.
Therefore I suggest that Scepticus has a closer
look at Hostel l i f e before he levels any further un-
constructive c r i t i c i s m based on s u p e r f i c i a l and
limited knowledge, for such unthinking remarks may
do more harm than good.
Yours,etc.
