BOUQUETS
The Lorphy Kace, ; s unpredictable as ever, won
by the outsiders after a hard race. The Lowry result
going equally astray, though the eight who sportingly
started the race with a broken oar rowed l i k e winners
almost a l l the way.
Congratulations to the Soccer Club on t h e i r fine
performance against N.K.C. It i s a great pity,almost
the same team playing i n Guild's jerseys should give
such a disheartening display against the Mines Rugger
eleven, who won the f i r s t game of the Technology Cup
competition.
There never was any doubt as to who would win
the U.L. Cross Country Championship. I t was only a
question of by how great a margin, well done I.C.C.C.C!
With, so many dazzling successes of other clubs,
the Hugger Club people f e e l they should r e f r a i n from
..ublicity u n t i l they too have won a U.L.cup; but
t h e i r record to date of - 9 won, 2 drawn, 2 l o s t games
i s very creditable, i n view of the prominence of some
of t h e i r opponents. When the team has mastered the
art of f a l l i n g on the loose b a l l , the Cup w i l l be well
within their grasp.
BOXING
Quite a large audience witnessed a fine
performance by I.C. Boxing Club when they beat
King's College by 4 bouts to I i n the gymnasium
on Tuesday 27th November.
Malcolm Muir, who i s to be congratulated
on h i s twice being selected to represent U.L.
t h i s season, gave I.C. the lead by winning the
f i r s t bout from D.Jessett on a very close points
decision. Kings' drew l e v e l when the v e r s a t i l e
.L.Dujon gained a points decision over John Davies
but were hardly i n the picture during the rest of
the evening.
After a quiet exhibition bout by two boxers
from Goldsmiths' College, Peter Harding put I.C.
ahead when he gained the verdict over J.Sharpe.
Len Palmer, the I.C. Flyweight, delighted the
spectators with some excellent boxing i n h i s ex-
h i b i t i o n with R.Leigh. Len c e r t a i n l y earned the
applause at the end of the bout since he was a
stone l i g h t e r than h i s opponent.
The l a s t two bouts of the evening both
yielded points v i c t o r i e s f o r the I.C. men, B i l l
Shepherd beating D . G i l l and Ricky Forscher
beating the amusingly unorthodox R.Campbell.
FENCING
There have been no deaths i n the Club
t h i s year. This i s probably due to the high
proportion o f beginners. ( I must, i n pas-
sing, record the fact that there have been no
b i r t h s either; but the reason f o r t h i s
escapes me.) The classes on Monday and
Thursday evenings have been well attended,
and there i s plenty of talent among t h i s year's
newcomers, amongst whom we have four from
I.C.W.A. Owing to an accident, f o r which we
were not responsible, to M. L^on Paul, we have
been short of one i n s t r u c t o r f o r the whole of
the term, but Mr. Z a b i e l s k i , pronounced George,
has been carrying on successfully alone.
On the sole occasion t h i s term on which
we were able to employ our f u l l team, we beat
the Polytechnic 16 - 11. The remainder o f
our matches against King's College H o s p i t a l ,
St. Paul's, Westminster, Dulwich College,
against whom we l o s t narrowly 13 - 1h, were less
successful - owing to the claims, and e f f e c t s ,
of another I.C. Club,'the University and the
Commemoration B a l l on members of the team.
JUDO
In the f i r s t match of the year, King's
College decisively beat the I.C. team by three
matches to n i l , with f i v e draws (
1
+ points to
n i l ) , although most matches were hard fought.
The beginners' bouts ended usually i n draws,
as i s so often the case before many throwB have
been mastered. Both o f King's (3rd Kyu) scored
two points o f f P h i l l i p s , I.C. (2nd Kjru) , the
f i r s t being a p a r t i c u l a r l y w e l l executed ankle-
throw. Our President, K. A. Everard (1st K|ru)
did well against Wetenhall (1st Kyu) , who i s
rumoured to have been p r a c t i s i n g hard of l a t e .
V/etenhall threw Everard only once, by a cunning
ashiguruma-cum-osotogari. A l l members o f the
I.C. Club, not only those i n the team, w i l l
have to practise harder, i f future matches are
to end more favourably f o r I.C.
MORPHY-DAY
The weather was f i n e , with a f r e s h south-
e r l y wind and a f a s t ebb t i d e , as the three
crews paddled up to the s t a r t of the Morphy Oup.
RSM. were on the Surrey s t a t i o n , O&G. i n the
Centre and ROS. on Middlesex. O.A.Brletow got
them o f f to a perfect start} the Mines, i n the
f a s t e r water went into the lead at onoe and were
ahead at the end of the f i r s t minute, as the
crews approached Harrods. .Here, however, as the
Mines lengthened out, they dropped t h e i r r a t i n g
and work a l i t t l e too muoh and the C&G., taking
f u l l advantage of t h i s went i n t o the lead at
once. A word of praise must go to the O&G. oox
for h i s t a c t i c s at t h i s point, f o r though
rather heavy-handed with the rudder, he never-
theless used h i s commanding lead to keep RSM.
out of the stream between Harrods and the Mile
Post and a t the same time enticed RCS. too f a r
over to Surrey, from whioh p o s i t i o n only sudden
and d r a s t i c a c t i o n saved a clash as Gardner
brought Guilds back to t h e i r own s t a t i o n . He
had thus given h i s crew every ohanoe to c o n s o l i -
date t h e i r lead, which they prooeeded to do i n
no unoertain manner0 At the Mile Post, C&G.
were a length ahead with the boat running w e l l .
RSM. and RCS,, neither of whom had s e t t l e d down
into a s t r i d e , began the Job of t r y i n g to
r e t r i e v e the s i t u a t i o n . At the Football Ground
Guilds were nearly three lengths ahead and RCS.
ahead of RSM. From t h i s point to the f i n i s h ,
theROS. found t h e i r s t r i d e , whilst HSM. r a l l i e d
a
s they passed the boathouses. Guilds were
going toowell to be at a l l troubled by t h i s and
won very well by 2j-lengths with ROS. ? length
ahead of HSM. The O&G. orew thoroughly deserved
to win. A much improved orew, they had learnt
the value of l e t t i n g the boat run between the
strokes and giving themselves the time to work
r e a l l y hard.
The Lowry Oup race was very e x c i t i n g and
well fought out, between an experienced C&G
crew who knew how to row, but a i d not give them-
selves the time to work, and a very inexperienced
RSM. crew who r e a l i s e d only too well t h e i r
l i m i t a t i o n s as oaremen and so contented themsel-
ves with a r a t i n g that suited them and gave them
the opportunity to "drive the blade to move the
boat". O&G. went ahead at the s t a r t , but would
not s e t t l e down and a "rush" developed,, RSM.
hung on and began to row them down. Opposite
the boathouaes, with RSM. leading and looking
capable of winning, a "crab" i n the Guilds boat,
(which was very well and quickly recovered),
gave the Mines an unforeseen £ length, which they
had made into a f u l l length at the f i n i s h .
The ROS. orew, giving away nearly two stone per
man, were no matoh f o r t h e i r heavier opponents,
and though rowing a plucky race, were unable to
come within s t r i k i n g distance.

CROSS-COUNTRY
{Sat. 1st. Dec: U n i v e r s i t y Championships.
This year's race promises to be a very open
a f f a i r - best summarised by the Daily Telegraph -
"the team t i l t e should pass from king's College to
London School ofEconomics or Imperial College".
A l l three colleges were f i e l d i n g strong teams -
almost the entire University 1st and 2nd teams are
drawn from them.
The I.C. team got away to their usual hopeless
start - a fa.iling which must be overcome v.hen runn-
ing i n f i e l d s of about two hundred. However, ».Garrod.
shot up from about t h i r t i e t h to twelfth during the
second mile, and F.Bagley worked h i s way up to the
leaders. Thus, at the f i n i s h I.C. had three i n the
f i r s t ten, and five i n twenty, running i n very
comfortable winners. I t was a very fine effort by
the whole team, i n a year when the University runn-
ing i s of such a high standard.
Ted Whitlock ran b r i l l i a n t l y to come i n third,
having just recovered from a very bad l e g i n j u r y ^ and
b i l l Dain came an excellent sixth, to equal the. pre*
vious record. '• .
