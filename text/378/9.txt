accommodation for "activists".
L e t no-one be deluded by
the F r o n t ' s c l a i m to oppose
international C a p i t a l i s m and
Communisium. The N a z i s c l a i m -
ed that a l s o - and their first
a c t s were to p h y s i c a l l y exter-
minate the powerful German
labour movement, the only force
capable of defeating c a p i t a l i s m .
The Front, like the N a z i s , is
financed by industrialists and
businessmen. They can now
gain strength however without
recruiting workers, duped by
the "opposing capitalism"
sham. F a s c i s m means death -
literally - for the labour move-
m e n t . In that context it i s good
to see I X . N . U . P E. stewards
"deploring the activity of the
National Front in I.C."
It i s time that we in C o l l e g e
stopped regarding the F r o n t ' s
propaganda with apathy. If a n d
when they dare to show their
faces they must be treated with
contempt and stopped from d i s -
tributing their r a c i s t poison. A t
present they are only a few
warped and pathetic perverts.
They must not be given the
chance to gain strength and
respectability.
The International S o c i a l -
i s t s Society are holding a
meeting this week to explain
who the N a t i o n a l Front are
and why they must be stopped.
We urge a l l those who are s i c k -
ened by the F r o n t ' s presence
here to come along.

Dear S i r
I have just witnessed the
verbal c l a s h outside M e c h . E n g .
between the N a t i o n a l Front and
the International S o c i a l i s t s .
B o t h are organisations w h i c h ,
in one way or another, c l a i m to
represent the " w o r k i n g c l a s s " .
I feel compelled to make the
facts known as I see them.
During 1974, 1 worked for 3
months on the factory floor of
the St. A l b a n s Rubber C o .1
w i l l be working there again
this E a s t e r and summer.
T h e work-force (of about
400) is about a quarter B e n g a l i ,
the remaining three-quarters be-
i n g " B r i t i s h " . Contrary to what
the N F says about immigrants
taking jobs away from B r i t i s h
people, there is a labour short-
age there. I was not aware of
any r a s c i s m on the part of the
full-time w o r k e r s . The only
r a s c i s t feelings I noticed were
expressed by some of the other
student workers who referred to
the B e n g a l i s as "Nig - nogs",
"Pakis", etc.
Most of the workers were
members of the 'moderate'
General and M u n i c i p a l Workers
U n i o n .With over 800,000 mem-
bers, i t is the third largest i n
B r i t a i n .
None of them went around
s e l l i n g "Socialist Worker",
b e i n g militant, or, quoting K a r l
M a r x . Most of them just put in
an honest day's work for an
honest day's pay.
While the S t . A l b a n s Rubber
C o . may not be a typical fact-
ory, I do not believe it to be by
any means a t y p i c a l .
F o r these reasons I b e l i e v e
that neither the I.S. nor the N . F
represent the true views of the
working man.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,
Thank you for your k i n d com-
ments with respect to my nom-
ination to a V i c e - P r e s i d e n c y of
the N U S . It might surprise you
to know that I myself did not
expect to be approached to
stand for this post. However, I
found that both w i t h i n the
B r o a d Left and outside of it
there was a great d e a l of pres-
sure on me to put my name for-
w a r d . C l e a r l y , one respond to
the wishes of " t h e p e o p l e "
and given my history I would
not stand as anything but a
candidate of the Broad L e f t .
Y o u know my attitude i n
respect of my work for the w i d -
er student organisations such
as U L U . I believe that the most
important problems which stu-
dents face today, such as
grants and education c u t s , are
not problems which can be
solved by i n d i v i d u a l c o l l e g e s
but only by a united fight by
the mass of students. It is
therefore incumbent upon stud-
ent leaders who are truly com-
mitted to w o r k i n g in the inter-
ests of their members to help in
the development of organisat+ •
ions that can generate that
unity and fight on the wider
q u e s t i o n s . It i s i n this pers-
pective I see the work that I do
for U L U .
L e t me make it clear that
that work has never taken prio-
rity over my duty of I C stud-
ents. I conduct thses duties i n
the time that other people w i l l
normally reserve for relaxation,
but I regard i t not just as a sep-
arate set of duties but as part
of my responsibility to those
who elected me.
It should a l s o be made clear
that up until now I have not
t a k a i a n y p u b l i c position on
the question of the F E L I X
Editor, though my views are
known within the executive .
My own a c t i v i t i e s i n no way
influenced my opinion o n that
matter. A s P r e s i d e n t of this
U n i o n my sole commitment i s
not to myself but to the organ-
i s a t i o n of the U n i o n and ultim-
ately to the members of the .
U n i o n .

Dear Sir,
I feel that by p u b l i s h i n g
such self-contradictory non-
sense as Mr C a m p b e l l ' s
"Metamorphosis" that you
are lowering the standard of
an otherwise excellent paper .
It is quite obvious that Mr.
C a m p b e l l has either not read
any of N I E T Z S C H E ' S works
or e l s e does not understand
t h e m . T o p a r a l l e l N I E T Z S C H -
E ' S philosophy with that of
the N a z i s is to f a l l foul of
N a z i propaganda .
If I may quote R . J . H o l l -
ingdale, the translator of
"Thus spoke Zarathustra"
who in his introduction writes,
"The fact of the matter is that
in the history of German thou-
ght NIETZSCHE stands at the
extreme opposite end to the
Nazis. Everything the Nazis
admired, he hated: and he
reserved some of his most vit-
riolic and scornful abuse for
the very things for which the
Nazis will probably be best
remembered, national idolatry
and anti-Semitism, whilst
regarding culture as a product
of r a c i a l mixture ."
I feel that the record must
be set straight for to do other-
w i s e i s to belittle one of the
truly great thinkers of the last
century .

Dear Sir,
I note on the front page of
F E L I X a plee not to rip down
N U S posters saying that "the
NUS are. entitled to have their
say no matter how much you
may disagree with it '.' Would
the N U S a l s o extend this dem-
ocratic sentiment to p o l i t i c a l
parties it disagrees with such
as the N a t i o n a l Front?

Dear Sir,
Who the h e l l does Trev
P h i l l i p s think he i s ? J u s t be-
cause the N a t i o n a l Front v i e w s
do not coincide with h i s own he
prevents them from holding
their planned meeting. O h , I
know he hammed up some bor-
ing story i n a n attempt to make
h i s c a n c e l l a t i o n of the meeting
sound, l o g i c a l and sensible (it
didn't) but anyone who saw him
p o s i n g at M e c h E n g pretending
to be representing the views of
I.C. could be forgiven for w i s h -
ing that the N a t i o n a l Front
would take over for just l o n g
enough to place him i n the h o l d
of the first banana boat for
J a m a i c a .

Dear Sir,
It's nice to see somebody
sufficiently concerned about
Ents to write to F E L I X , even
if the c r i t i c i s m in this case
was uninformed and unjustified.
More c r i t i c i s m would help us to
improve the entertainment we
provide, so we invite anyone
who has any suggestions to
come and see us i n the U n i o n
Office any lunchtime.
I'd better say some fairly
obvious things about die way
we work: firstly, the size of
bands we can put on. If we put
on s m a l l bands, we compete
with a multitude of small ven-
ues in London, and experience
has shown we loose money .And
o b v i o u s l y we cannot put on the
supergroups, because the Great
H a l l i s too s m a l l . T h i s effect-
i v e l y l i m i t s us to bands i n the
£400 - £1100 range.
Secondly, the way we book
b a n d s . We book through the Bro
Bron A g e n c y . T h i s means that
we are backed up by a lot of
professional expertise and kno-
wledge when negotiating for
bands, which in practice makes
it p o s s i b l e to get a lot more
bands than we would otherwise
be able to.
Thirdly, how we choose
bands. When we have free dates
our chairman, M a l c o l m , a s k s for
suggestions at our weekly com-
mittee meetings, and takes the
l i s t (which regularly includes
a l l those bands Mr Stevenson
suggests) to Bron, and B r o n
tell us what is available, and
negotiate the contract with the
group's agent.
T h i s should give some idea
of the constraints we work und-
er, and make it apparent that it
i s not a simple matter of app-
roaching a band to book i t .
T o answer some of the i n -
dividual points i n Mr Steven-
s o n ' s letter. B o o k i n g Chapman-
Whitney, Mike Heron and die
H . M . K . , a l l new a c t s , and
Sweet, was adventurous, w h i l e
booking staid and tired F a i r -
port (who played here last year
a n d before, dummo), and 10c,c.
would definitely not b e . Hat-
f i e l d and the North do not look
to be an economic proposition.
l O c . c are too big, preferring to
play larger h a l l s . A n y more
suggestions, A P . ?
A s for us not having enough
variety, I think a line up rang-
i n g from T h i n L i z z y to T o m
P a x t o n , and from L e o Saizer to
B a r c l a y James Harvest i s quite
v a r i e d, to say the least,
We want to put on three b i g
c o n c e i t s at the beginning of the
Summer term, before exams
start. Now is your chance to
come and tell us what you want.
