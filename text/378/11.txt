I.C. had a week of mixed
fortune, losing 3 - 0 to South-
a m p t o n and winning 4 - 1
against B . A . C Weybridge.
A t Southampton I . C , forced
to defend from the start, were
unlucky to go one down to a
scrambled goal midway thr-
ough the first half. T h i s score
was maintained until late in the
second half when John A d o l f
Andrews (umpire) awarded a
penalty flick because he felt
c o l d . Roger Holson only just
got out of the way of this i n
time and with minutes left
Southampton went on to make
it three.
After the game I.C. lost a
boat race to some s p e c i a l i s t s
but reigned supreme at darts
until Southampton, by now re-
splendent in yellow shirts
printed with the words W E S S E X
A N C H O R S (Dr Spooner - please
note!) started throwing beer
about. At this point it was nec-
essary to throw the main elect-
ricity switch and depart in dar*
k n e s s . A t N O stage during the
evening were any trophies
taken, nor did Jeh Bashar find
six glasses lying in the gutter.
Nothing noteworthy occurred
at Weybridge; I.C . dominated
throughout and even injuries to
John-bolshie-Andrews and
Capt. Hansen (normal red
blood) could not bring B . A . C .
into the g a m e . G o a l s came from
Tututivo, Arrowsmith and •
Bashar. Thanks to Mrs Mike
V i y e r a for allowing him to
make an appearance, and Roger
for his support - bring a radio

third quarter we found oursel-

h a s i s e our predicament Rory
deaded to miss penalty. How-
ever he was given a second
chance shortly after and man-
aged to squeeze this one home .
(the captain d e c l i n i n g the op-

start of the last quarter of five
minutes we were s t i l l 3 - 1

On Thursday 6th Feb the
first team completed the form-
ality of beating Mary's I for the
second time, this time by 6 - 1 ,
and thus maintained our 100%
record. After getting an early
lead through Bluebottle, we
reverted to our customary
tactic of starting badly by c o n -
ceding a soft goal, before get-
ting to work on the Mary's
goal. Both the debut boys,
Phaedon and Tony, made pro-

playing two quarters each.

A s l a s t week's F E L I X recorded, our pretensions to stardom
continued at the St Edmund H a l l Relay on Wednesday 5th, the
results of which were:
saw the second team drop from

Conditions for the Southern

changed from the usual diabo-

I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e 2 K i n g s C o l l e g e 2
On Saturday 8th February I J C . l s t team travelled over to L o n -
don H o s p i t a l s ' ground in Walthamstow expecting to p l a y their cup
semi-final against K i n g s C o l l e g e . Although conditions were ideal
and both teams were ready and w a i t i n g by 2.15 the game could not
be played as the referee had failed to materialize. The two s k i p -
pers e v e n t u a l l y a g r e e d t o play
the match as a' league fixture
with a K i n g s C o l l e g e travelling
reserve (actually their union
president) as the referee.
What entailed was a hard
and uncompromising match with
some very entertaining football
played by both sides. In the
first half K i n g s began with
some penetrating attacks and
finding our lads rather lethargic
took the initiative and stayed
w e l l on top for the forty five
minutes .After about 20 minutes
they scored their first goal
when the two Ians failed to
clear the ball from the s i x yard
area in spite of 6 different
opportunities toHead it away.
Shortly afterwards another error
in our own half led to a K i n g s
winger centreing the ball and
their centre forward hitting it
perfectly on the volley to score
a great goal.
H a l f time saw us two goals
down, reflecting in a most rag-
ged performance in the first
half but determined to make
amends. A n d so we d i d . F o r the
next to minutes the ball hardly
came out of the K i n g s half as a
rejuvenated I . C . a t t a c k e d relen-
t l e s s l y . F i g h t i n g for every
loose ball our forwards had the
K i n g s defence under constant
pressure and eventually it crac-
k e d when the inevitable G l e n
Swaby hit one in from the edge
of the a r e a . We continued to
dictate the play and about a
quarter of an hour later a quick
touch throw from K . Seukiw
found S. Bates with plenty of
time to head pasts the groping
hands of the keeper - a connoi-
seus goal in every respect.
The remainder of the game
was a grim struggle to put
away a winner which never
came but s t i l l provided a lot of
t h r i l l s .
Although we failed to conq-
uer on the day, a repeat of that
second half performance in the
semi final should see us thro-
ugh with no difficulty.
