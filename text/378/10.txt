Argent: In Concert in the Great Hall.
I w a s going to slate pop groups for
the manner in which they dress until
Argent c a m e on s t a g e . T h i s w a s a c l a s s -
ic c a s e of extremes . The support had
looked a s if their clothes were borrowed
third hand while Argent were dressed in
the most ultra modern effeminate gear they
could find.
The group were welcomed with eager
enthusiasm that d i d not seem to die until
the final anticlimax that ended a perform-
ance that was notable for its e x c e s s i v e -
n e s s . The only other achievement worthy
of note was Rod Argent' s virtuosity on
keyboards (he even plays with h i s feet
and posterior.) They started off with an
interesting instrumental that is taken of
their forthcoming album c a l l e d 'Service'.
We were then treated to a couple of Argent
oldies one of which was'Music from the
spears'
COMCKftT
The next song w a s ' T r a p e z e ' , a n arrang-
ement, by J i m Rodford their bass guitar-
ist,' of a n o l d Indian piece c a l l e d 'FAkir'.
A well executed number and the last of
the concert for the mixer then took it into
his head to overload the-bass which tot-
a l l y drowned out the other instruments
except the drums.
The encore w a s a washout and the
group did not reappear despite persistent
c a l l s from the audience and s o ended a n -
other Saturday night concert at I.C. with
Ents left to clear the mess up. One good
thing about the whole affair i s that it w a s a
full house and Ents have made some profit
out of it. One last point. Argent have two
new members, the lead guitarist John G r i -
maldi who is only 19 and the drummer,
John Varity. T h e former has a lot of
promise for the future.

Billy Cobham: Spectrum (Atlantic)
. B I L L Y C O B H A M served a long app-
renticeship as a s e s s i o n m u s i c i a n , playing
with artists from James Brown to Deodato,
and then gained wider acceptance as the
driving force a n d timekeeper-extraordinary
behind John M c L a u g h l i n ' s Mahavlshnu
Orchestra. However, he Is now fronting
h i s own band, Spectrum, w h i c h appears to
be doing w e l l In the States and has three
fine albums to h i s credit, of which this Is
the first.
Many jazz musicians these days are
making their music more a c c e s s i b l e by the
Introduction of more popular forms Into the
b a s i c a l l y complex nature of j a z z , and in
evidence on this album, are brought
together some of the heavier elements of
rock, the c l a s s i c s In part, the L a t i n beat,
and the funky, faultless drumming of
Cobham himself.
'Spectrum' c o n s i s t s of large hunks of
]azzy-funk dotted with Ilghtnlng-quick
s o l o s , and interspersed with various
electronic raretles (possibly due to a
cautious approach on a first solo album).
Cobham lays down' a s e a of percussion
through which moves the bass of L e e
Sklar (a long way from 'Sweef Baby James')
and the heart of the matter Is fired out by
Tommy Bolln on guitar and J a n Hammer
(keyboards).
Cobham knows when to lay off the
volume, a l l o w i n g the other musicians
room for movement a n d finesse, and
yet a s soon as a number begins to drag,
the beat and power return Immediately.
T h i s Is c l a s s music from an artist
considered by many a s one of the finest
drummers In the business and shows a
vast Improvement, due to the strength of
the compositions, or h i s work with John

Ross: The Pit and The Pendulum
(RSO 2394 1 44)
ROSS A R E a five piece band built aro-
British s e s s i o n guitarist A l a n Ross who
writes and sings 90% of the material i n -
cluded on this a l b u m . T h i s , their second
record for R S O , i s that strange bird the
'Concept' album. L i k e so many bands be-
before them they have managed to pro-
duce music and lyrics that have little or
nothing in common with the original ' c o n -
cept;' m this c a s e Edgar A l l a n P o e ' s c l a -
s s i c .
However, the music is very listenable,
pleasant songs, with some R o s s himself
sings w e l l , not unlike Stevie Windwood
and the band play with competance, but
one has the impression the musk; lacks
that v i t a l ingredient - originality.
