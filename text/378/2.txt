P O L A R I S A T I O N i s , for a college
the s i z e of Imperial, a nasty syndrome .
The discord created by the abrasive
juxtaposition of the N . F . v . the Left
can do the Union no good, can it?
Two butnph sheets have appeared
this week: One from the N P , one from
the IC. Communist Party. Neither are
c o n c l u s i v e ; both contain savage de-
ceptions. It t y p i c a l l y characterises the
spectacular p o l i t i c a l chasm that e x i s t s
between the two ideologies.
We can dispense with the Comm-
unist rot concerning last week's anti-
N . F . m e e t i n g being "...the most suc-
cessful mass action by I.C. students
for years" .The vast majority of those
representing the Left were not from .
I . C . We can a l s o flush away the N . F .
garbage which accuses the I C U P r e s i -
dent of showing " — h i s w i l l i n g n e s s to
engage in despicable f a s c i s t thugg-
e r y . . . " . That is a serious overstate-
ment .
But the main point i s this: the more
polarised people become on this i s s u e ,
the greater w i l l come the potential dan-
ger of the release of the inherent ten-
sion a s s o c i a t e d with the situation.
Heaven help us when all Hell is let
loose .
E l e c t i o n fever i s with us once again
and, that dastardly cur, Rumour, i s d o -
ing his rounds not only i n I C U but i n the
C C U ' s a l s o .
Rumour is most rife in I C U . F o r the
post of President, P . T . , P .W., D.S . and
N . F . l o o k l i k e l y contenders. The post
of Deputy President looks a bit dodgy,
but D . S . appears to be in with a
chance. The H o n . Sec. next year could
either be M.S,, P . B . , M X . or J . D .
There are now three probables for
F E L I X Editor: P . E . , C D . and H.S.
In Mines, for President the solo run-
ner is B . B . ; V . P . looks like a battle
between G . B . and R A . ; Hon. Sec.
could be one of F . C . , P . B . or C.W.
G u i l d s looks a bit sparse at the
moment with only K . A , T . F . and F . S .
making a move, w h i l s t R C S U i s cautiou-
sly suggesting S . B . or A J . for P r e s i d -
ent; J . W . o r C M . for V . P . ; and A S . ,
N . R . o r T . T . for H o n . S e c .
D i d you spot the Union Refectory
doing a super cleanup in anticipation
of the v i s i t of the Chairman of the
Governing Body? // did not make much
difference to the food though!

Dear Sir,
I should l i k e to raise some
points in reply to the recent
letter from Mr J . J . A l b r e c h u
He claims that 'as a foreign-
er he is probably less prejud-
iced'. What s p e c i a l q u a l i f i c a -
tions does being a foreigner
confer upon a person to make
him,'/ess prejudiced'? - or i s
M r . A l b r e c h t merely showing
h i s prejudice?
The vast majority of people
i n this country have never
exploited anyone - the people
making the profits from the
Empire not being the B r i t i s h
Workers . Why, therefore, do
they have to be ' r e s p o n s i b l e '
for the m i l l i o n s of aliens allow-
ed B r i t i s h Nationality under the
1948 act? If these people have
their own independent homeland
then they are presumably cap-
able of taking care of themsel-
ves - but then I suppose that Mr.
Albrecht is so prejudiced as to
b e l i e v e that they should not be
granted the right to self-deter-
mination.
Mr. Albrecht seems to desire
the enforced integration of
peoples of totally different
c u l t u r e s . T h i s seems to be a
particularly r a c i a l i s t and fas-
c i s t attitude. Why cannot people
be allowed to live in their own
way, in their own land, without
being forced to adopt customs
that are e s s e n t i a l l y alien to
them? A s to the difficulties of
life in a multi-racial society we
need only glance briefly around
the world to see the misery and
strife a r i s i n g from such societ-
i e s . F o r example, up to 2,000
people were k i l l e d in race riots
in M a l a y s i a during 1969 ;
10,000,000 Ibos were slaught-
ered by the Nigerians in 1966;
500,000 have been k i l l e d and
115,000 made homeless in the
struggle for self-determination
of the Negroes of Southern Sud-
an in their attempt to form a
separate ' R e p u b l i c of A z a n i a ' ,
etc.. Presumably these are
only 'minor' difficulties to the
r a c i a l i s t Mr Albrecht.
F i n a l l y , Mr Albrecht wond-
ers where the N F stands over
the question of Europeans: the
p o l i c y is quite simple, they
w i l l not be repatriated (but
those who w i s h to leave Britain
may, of course, do so quite
freely but we would a l l o w no
more European immigration
(except in certain s p e c i a l cas-
es, e.g., refugees from the
Communist States.).

Dear Sir,
I am very grateful to you
for sending me F E L I X every
week -1 find it very interest-
ing reading. I was particularly
interested in the articles on
student grants, and the agita-
tion for an increase. 1 wonder
what present day students
spend their money on, and
what they consider to be the
real e s s e n t i a l s of l i f e - a f t e r
a l l , a grant is meant to be for
e s s e n t i a l s , not luxeries . A l s o
I think it should be borne i n
mind that many parents pay a
proportion of their offsprings'
grants, and any increase w i l l
come s t i l l harder on them,
both as parents and as tax-
payers .
When I was at I.C. (about
the time F E L I X was born!) I
had to cut down on food, make
my own clothes, and do w i t h -
out anything that wasn't ab-
solutely b a s i c to existence.
Nevertheless, I had a very
good time.
So, what do today's stud-
ents exprect? Would any of
them like to publish, in
F E L I X , a detailed budget
01-589 5111 Ext. 2166
(bearing i n mind that the grant
i s only intended to cover the
thirty-odd weeks spent act-
ually i n College)?
I do rather get the impres-
sion that students nowadays
feel that the world owes them
a l i v i n g . T h i s i s not so;
they have yet to prove that
they have any worthwhile
contribution to make.
Yours faithfully,

Sir,
i was s i c k e n e d to see the
letter in " F E L I X " from a
National Front member. N . U S .
p o l i c y rightly c a l l s for no plat-
form for racists and fascists -
by flouting this you are h e l p i n g
them in their efforts to gain
credibility.
Int. 2881
The recent propaganda
campaign by the N . F . at I.C. is
an insult to the thousands of
foreign students and workers in
the C o l l e g e . If the N . F . had
their way, these people would
be humiliated and driven from
the country. The prospect of an
N F . government however is re-
mote. Their real and immed-
iate threat l i e s i n their thugg-
ery against black people and
trade unionists of any s k i n c o l -
our. B l a c k shop stewards in
Manchester have recently been
slashed and beaten up by thugs
believed to be members of the
N . F . , and the Front has been
active in breaking their strike.
F a s c i s m appeals to the
frightened little man; if offers
the chance to feel power as
part of a para-military organis-
a t i o n . Hence the emphasis on
marches with drums and U n i o n
J a c k spears. Hence the plans
of the N F. are to set up a L o n -
don headquarters with dormitory
