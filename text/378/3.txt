CORNER

T H E P O S S I B I L I T Y of a research charter for postgraduate
students, has been d i s c u s s e d by the P G group committee. The
general feeling was that w h i l e it w a s a good idea, the implica-
tions of such a proposal would have to be examined in d e t a i l .
A t present there is a C . V . C . P . study group looking into a l l as-
pects of postgraduate educa-
t i o n - S o far they have not both-
ered to a s k for submission from
any postgraduate groups. How-
ever, it is hoped that they w i l l
eventually show some interest
in our views on the various
i s s u e s . The L . S . O . - U L U post-
graduate sector is holding a
meeting to draw up a London
postgraduate submission to this
Study Group. T h i s could provide
the forum for d i s c u s s i o n on the
research charter. A n y proposals
that might come up w i l l be pre-
sented at the next meeting of
the IC and G G .
The C i v i l Engineering post-
grads held a meeting to form a
postgrad group last Tuesday .
About forty students turned up
and the response when it came
to forming a committee c o n -
THIS NUBILE young lov-
ely is Henrietta, a real stun-
ner from Manchester, who is
studying as a third - year
Metallurgist. She says she
finds her equipment "a little
embarassing." Her hobbies
include playing with pistols
and looking for a good under-
arm razor.
What does she think of
FELIX printing pictures of
girls on page three? "I agree
wiv Twev Phillips that page
fwee is sexist claptwap".
Oooohl
PS. Thanks to Angela for the
nightie.
P P S. Howard has promised
never to do this again.

ANNOUNCEMENT
The Editor of FELIX would like to apologise to Gill
McConway, Anne Nolan and Robin for the inconvenience
and the hassles that arose during the production of this
edition of F E L I X . "I am entirely responsible for what
happened" - Mike Williams.
s i s t i n g of representatives
from each section, was very
encouraging. A t this meeting
it was noted that postgraduate
representation on staff student
committees was totally inade-
quate. In fact while departments
are eager to listen to undergrad-
uate opinion, they seem to i g -
nore postgraduate o p i n i o n . With
so many departmental P G groups
in existence, now is the time to
press for more effective repre-
sentation.
On the subject of the post-
graduate group, we at Imperial
have one of the most active
groups in the country. Compared
to the other London colleges,
we are in a c l a s s of our o w n .
The structure of the post-
graduate group is such that we
have very effective contact with
grassroots opinion. This is a
major achievement considering
that postgraduates are among
the most difficult of groups to
organise . The people who de-
serve the credit for this, are the
various departmental represent-
a t i v e s .
A s mandated by the I.C.
postgraduate group, I have been
looking into ways and means of
obtaining s p e c i a l 'thesis grants'
(to cover the full costs of writ-
ing up). A letter requesting •
such a grant was sent to the
chairmen of the S R C , N E R C ,
A R C and S S R C . So far I have
had one reply - from the S R C
chairman. T h e gist of the letter
w a s that the S R C w a s b a s i c a l l y
sympathetic to our case, and
w i l l convey our views to the
government grant review panel
when it next meets, sometime
latter this year. In my letter I
had mentioned a figure of £100
as being the average cost. Some
doubt was expressed about this
figure and I w a s told that it
would be helpful if some authe-
nticated average b i l l s could be
provided. I would therefore be
grateful if anybody who has
some bills could send them to
me c/o Union office). My per-
sonal feeling is that we have a
fairly strong c a s e , and in spite
of the adverse economic c l i m -
ate, may get some cost of 'thes-
is grant'.
F i n a l l y , I talked about the
' l o v i n g capacity ot postgrad-
uates in my last P i G Affairs
Corner. There seems to be
enormous interest among the
I.C. g i r l s , who seemed on the
whole to agree with my v i e w s .
However, their main complaint
was that they rarely ever see
any real specimens of "homo
sapiens sapiens" ie P o s t g r a d -
uates. S o a l l y o u P G ' s , now is
your chance! Get out there a n d
start loving!!
