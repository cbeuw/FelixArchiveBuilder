T H E NEW Theta. completed
just in time for its debut at
l a s l night's Theta Dinner,
weighs an incredible 105 lbs.
The solid stainless steel
base and the lead-loaded shaft
w i l l put an end to the trad-
itional heaving of Theta above
the President's head during
a Kangela. A quivering Pete
Teague managed to hold it in
die horizontal position for only
a lew seconds during the dem-
onstration for F F . L I X . A slow
Kang'ela would surely defeat
anyone's muscular prowess.
What your VOTE means.
There are a lot of elections taking place this term, a l l
using the S T V (single transferable vote) s y s t e m . T h i s a d -
mittedly is rather complicated but I w i l l try to explain
what effect you w i l l have by voting in different ways.
The first choice you have is whether or not you fill in a
voting paper. If you do not, you obviously have no influ-
ence on the results of the election except that if less than
'â€¢4 of the F u l l Members of the Union vote in the election
for President, Honorary Secretary, Deputy President or
Editor the election is invalid. A s s u m i n g you do fill in a
paper, you have a choice between voting and abstaining.
If you abstain it means that you either have no confidence
in any of the candidates, or you do not feel you have
enough knowledge of any of the candidates to express any
preference,,
A n abstention counts towards the '25% threshold' but w i l l
not alter the result in any way.
A s s u m i n g now that you have a preference you have to fill
in the paper properly and not ' s p o i l ' it . T h i s means that
there must be a figure ' 1 ' against the name of one, and
only one candidate. Further numbers can be written, but no
number can be left out or used twice. You must not mark
your paper with an ' X ' .

If you only mark your paper with a T and no other numbers
it means you have given marks to one candidate and none
to any of the others .
So if there is one candidate you s p e c i f i c a l l y do not want
elected it is best to put no number against his name. If you
feel, however, that you have some preference amongst the
other candidates, having put a ' 1 ' against the name of your
first preference, m a k r ' 2 ' , ' 3 ' , etc., against their name.
I hope this has made some sense to you, and clarified to
you what power your vote has. If you have any further
queries do not hesitate to come and see me.

BLACK MENACE
against
FASCIST BOGEY
Charlie Wrigley
It is not often I put pen to paper , but in the last edition of
F E L I X (no. 377) there was a lot of matter which provokes com
ment. The p o l i t i c a l scene at College seems to have turned to
near hysteria by the sudden appearence of the National Front,
and the announciarion of Trevor P h i l l i p s ' candidature in the .
coming NUS elections, not to
mention their recent entangle-
ments. It's perfect: black
menace versus fascist bogey:
the plot sets sweeter than
" W e s f Side Story" .
But in its enormity, the en-
actment is grotesque, in that
this affair has to be resolved
by the "because its good for
you" smack across the head
principle and 900 I.C. Stud-
ents can't be wrong syndrome .
I take, for example the re-
porting (not just by F E L I X )
of "Red Lion Thursday" at
I.C. when it was said police
were present to prevent Nat-
ional Front members from go-
ing into Mech. E n g . , and then
was further said open meeting
was held in room 342 of that
b u i l d i n g , "no-one being den-
ied entry." A somewhat c a l -
v a n i s t i c view of predestina-
tion? But this is the great
anomaly the N U S slams down
in front of us: believe in free-
dom of speech as a funda-*
mental right on the one hand,
whilst denying a platform for
fascists and racists on the
other.
To anyone suggesting I
support the National Front,
my reply is rurtly negative.
But the point is, labels are toe
e a s i l y applied to people who
deviate from the norms set
down by groups in society.
Confrontation w i l l never pro-
duce solutions, or compromi-
ses,only a total victory for
one side. But is this the re-
sult which we are urged to
struggle for? People ask for
democractic rights but if you
are not a member of the maj-
ority, democracy is as oppres-
sive a dictatorship .Even the
majority have to confide in

wheel around his head.
I don't know if he is
right or not, but there is no
doubt that the possibility of
inestial drive w i l l continue to
feed the fires of controversy
for a long time to come. At the
moment E r i c Lailhwaite must
feel rather like the man who
invented the wheel, but perhaps
in a thousand years tourists
w i l l be flocking to see the tom-
bstone enscribed:
"To Hell with a place to
stand; give me a wheel
and I will move the Earth"
their elected peers, but both
have to accept their restrict-
ions and impositions . S i n c e
democracy is our choice.
I hope this can lead my
prose to its c o n c l u s i o n , be-
cause a l s o in the last edition
of F E L I X it was reported that
at the Union Meeting the NUS
A N D T H E National Front did
concur on something: namely
their respective official view-
points on the Common Market.
In those times when absurdity
is the vogue, it is a m a z i n g
the word offical and its con-
notations should not be more
v i s i b l e . Individuals have to
make c h o i c e s , one hopes with-
out hard instinct, and certain-
ly not with the amazing tinned,
argument of doubetalk that too
often appears. "Whiter th;
white washing powder doe ,
not work tor grey shirts .''
My dictionary defines fas-
c i s m as "representing a nat-
ionalist reaction against soc-
ialism and communism". Re-
place the words nationalism,
S o c i a l i s m and communism by
variables, say, x, y and z and
you have a formula for any
p o l i t i c a l movement. There are
many reasons for a person to
switch one pole to another
extreme . One of our current
president's favourite terms
,last year was opportunism^
Maybe, but beliefs are entire-
ly personal and whatever the
reasons for holding them h i s -
tory provides ample examples
of ritual slaughter of those
who decline to conform .
Saints and sinners alike are
formed, but together they are
dashed on the rocks below the
c l i f f s of an uncertain comp-
l a c e n c y .
CONGRATULATIONS!
FELIX offers its sincere
congratulations to Ron
Appleby today, his Wed'
ding Day. We feel sure
that FELIX readers will
forgive him for devoting
his energies to activities
other than 'Stanley' next
week.
