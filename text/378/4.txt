There are those who feel that I
may be "overselling" the campaign
against education cuts. However,
I cannot escape the feeling that
people, both those with power and
those without it, are fi sidling while
Rome is burning. The complacency
of some people involved in education
today, students, staff, and bureau-
crats, is absolutely staggering.
Last Friday, I went along to the
Inner London Education Authority, for a
meeting with the leader of the I L E A , to
d i s c u s s the effects of the I L E A ' S a c t -
ions in L o n d o n . Y o u w i l l remember
reading that w e a r e s p e c i f i c a l l y
affected by the withdrawal of the
£270,000 I L E A grant from the university
of L o n d o n . The I L E A i s in the process
of cutting back on its education services
in London: c o l l e g e s closed or merged,
courses dropped, students lost, e t c .
Part-time schooling and c l a s s e s of 4 5
have been the norm for many school
children, for some time.
Yet the representatives of the
ILEA had the nerve to sit and say
that the education services in Lon-
don were actually improving! When
I suggested that they should tell
that to the schoolchildren, their
teachers, or the students who were
being chopped, they wrung their
hands in horror that I should be so
uncouth as to suggest that they
worry about mundane matters
matters like that.
The I L E A is known for i t s pro-
gress iveness (as some of my colleagues
on the deputation, which included rep-
resentatives of the teachers lecturers,
and the T U C General C o u n c i l kept on
saying) If this is the way that they are
regarding the c r i s i s in education, in a
situation where their own services are
near to breakdown, how i s the far-from-
progressive D E S regarding it? I shudd-
er to t h i n k . A s far a s 1 am concerned
some of these people need a good swift
k i c k to shake them out of their com-
placency - like many of our own
students.
One of the by-products of last week's
" N F " episode w a s something that the
Union has been searching for for some
time - the beginnings of genuine links
with the other Unions on campus. In the
past, there have been attempts to form
joint committees of one kind or another,
for various abstract reasons . However,
a a I have stated on many o c c a s i o n s , in
the present economic s i t u a t i o n , with the
education system under heavy attack, the
major prerequisite for effective defence
against that attack is the unity of a l l
those who are about to come under the
hammer.
We often speak of joining witth organ-
ised labour, cooperating with campus
unions and s o on, a s far a s I am concer-
ned, w e must never degenerate to the
level where w e are simply regurgitating
trendy idealogical rhetoric. G i v e n the
image created for the student by the
mass media, of the bolshy, doped - up
freaked - out, idle, anarchist, it i s
little wonder that many people are un-
sympathetic, or even hostile to students.
I have found, however, that the
people who actually work with
students, who know our circumstan-
ces and environment, have a totally
different, and truer perception of us.
For that reason, when we speak of
gaining public support for our cam-
paigns, it seems clear that it is the
people who are closest to us that we
should approach first. And the way
that we have to do that is through
our respective representative bodies
- i.e. the unions.
To return to my original points, in
the campaign against education c u t s ,
unity is of utmost importance. T h e jobs
of the staff exist because of the s t u -
dents; the cuts mean fewer students
and fewer f a c i l i t i e s , and therefore, few-
er j o b s . It i s in the interest of the
people who work for the C o l l e g e , at a l l
levels, to support the campaign against
cuts in any meaningful way that they
c a n .

I w a s gratified to read that someone
thinks that the page 3 pictures of girls
in F E L I X i s pointless. I agree; further
than I think that it i s in poor taste to
parallel the features of the D a i l y Mirror
and T h e Sun. These papers may s e l l a
lot of copies; but it seems t o me that
I.C. students deserve a bit more credit
to their intelligence and taste, than to
have their own paper pushing out sexist
claptrap.
In International Women's Year, it
is particularly inappropriate to pre-
sent women as mere camera - fodd-
er. It does nothing to enhance their
status as serious, "thinking"
people .

Anyone who can help, please let me
have your name in the Union Office.

Discretionary awards
A FULL GRANT FOR ALL STUDENTS
SUPPORT THE LOBBY
OF THE ILEA ON TUESDAY 25TH FEBRUARY
The discretionary award student lies on the other side of the "binary syst-
ems". There is no obligation on the local authority to pay the whole of a stu-
dent's grant or even any part of i t .
The most immediate example of the discretionary award is the postgraduate .
The award of a P G grant is not automatic npon the student being accepted on to
the course. With the SRC catting back on their number of awards in science and
engineering, the picture now looks bleak.
One of the major claims of the campaign is an end to discretionary awards.
That means an end to prospective P G ' s desperately rnshing around in order to
find a grant.
Get rid of the discretionary award once and for all.
Overseas students
What are the major problems that overseas students face?
/. Higher fees - over £250 compared with nearly £90 for the "home" student.
2. The IL&A has just increased these fees by 20%.
3 .Overseas students are not allowed to work during vacations.
4. Discrimination by landlords who charge a higher rate of hostel fees for
overseas students.
Thus the system is essentially designed to ensure that only wealthy stud-
ents study in -Britain.
End this discrimination - parity for overseas students.
NATIONAL DEMO
ON FRIDAY FEB 28TH
