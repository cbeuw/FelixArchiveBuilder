6 FELIX
interview by R i z S h a k i r
The Chairmen of the I C P G G is an affable, intelligent man of
s l i m build with a rather characteristic beard. I met him in the
lounge bar (now the in scene for F E L I X interviews) where after
a false start or two we were able to proceed with putting the
focus on Tom Abraham.
Tom was born in India
where he lived for two years
and then subsequently lived
in E t h i o p i a , Ghana and cur-
rently England where he has
been receiving h i s graduate
education. He obtained h i s
first degree in E l e c t r i c a l E n g -
ineering at Surrey and is in
his final year at IC as a re-
search student. H i s subject
of inquiry is electrical mater-
i a l s . H e likes the life at IC
though he feels that " the
social life here is made a
mockery of by We male and
female ratio which is rather
unfortunate " H e a l s o feels
that the cliquey atinoshpere
that ' i s a.bit worse here than
elsewhere .." is not one of
the better aspects of IC l i f e .
When I asked him about h i s
job a s the P G A O he was at
on Tom Abraham
edited by Paul E k p e n y o n g
pains to stress that he saw
himself more as being the
Chairman of I C P G G than the
P G A O which he feels has too
many limitations .In his role
as Chairman of the I C P G G he
would "like to be seen more
as a spokesman tor a sector of
higher education at IC" .
There are three main a s p -
ects to h i s job which are dem-
onstrating (tutoring), acade-
mic, and sitting on the P G
Committee. On the fir,?, he is
trying to negotiate for reason-
able rates of pay and proper
conditions to work in .
"The second aspect is the-
academic one, that is, as tar
as research is concerned try-
ing to safeguard the interests
of PGs in that a lot of PGs
end up doing projects which
are none starters . .Unfortun-
ately I do not think that either
the College or the individual
departments seem to apprec-
iate the extent of the prob-
lem...".
The third aspect involves
organising s o c i a l s , meetings,
d i s c u s s i o n s and urging P G s
I.CU and U L U P G group. The
I C H O O a s an u i y a n o e d UuCiy
is now on a more sound foot-
ing he s a y s , " / have been
pleasantly suprised by the
amount of interest that has
been shown in the group".
T h i s has meant more s u c c e s s
with s o c i a l s they have organ-
ised and progress on a rese-
arch charter which w i l l detail
the r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s of stud-
ents and supervisqrs/'Trie
possibility ol a "'thesis grant"
is also one of our main aims
and we have received encour-
aging signs from tiie research
councils concerned" .
He hopes that by the time
his term of office comes to an
end the P G A O w i l l bf; a mem-
ber of the executive though
the RSMU vote was a setback.
H i s last comment w a s "/
would like to retire to Jam-
aica" .
The wheel turns
full circle

T H E R E A R E not many people who can get 400. people into a
250 seat lecture theatre and keep them there for two hours. But
one such man is E r i c Laithwaite, and he proved it last week at
a t a l k presented by the R C S Mathematical and P h y s i c a l Society
If the talk;was late starting it was only because the Professor
himself was trapped in the
crowds jamming the portals of
P h y s i c s Theatre 1, and exper-
ienced great difficulty in get-
ting in to see hrs own lecture.
But when at last he emerged i n -
to the limelight the thunderous
applause with which he was
greeted amply confirmed the
enormous prestige of "our
Eric".
But why should 400 people
want to see a lecture entitled
"The Multiplication of Bananas
by Umbrellas"? Perhaps be-
c a u s e they know that when E r i c
Laithwaite talks of bananas and
umbrellas he really means g y r -
oscopes or linear motors, either
oi wmcn is a oue for lots of
fun and defying of authority.
But this time of course, it was
gyroscopes .The man who took
on the full weight of the E s t -
ablishment, shocked the Royal
Institution, confounded the
pundits and delighted hundreds
of children, had come home to
tell h i s flock a l l about h i s
adventures.
The seeminly bizarre behav-
iour of gyroscopes has always
proved to be a rich source of
amusement and a cause of much
racking of b r a i n s . N o doubt with
this in mind Professor L a i t h -
waite opened h i s talk by dem-
onstrating that a spinning
gyroscope tends to keep i t s
a x i s fixed in space. But fix-
ed relative to what? Is there
absolute space? Or as the Prof,
puts it, "What is it pointing
at?"
But there was no time to
dwell on the implications of
this question a s the Prof,
launched into his analogy be-
tween gyroscopic motion and
electromagnetiSm. With impart-
urbable confidence he breezed
his way through the demonst-
rations and concluded defiantly
that there is no angular momen-
tum or central force associated
with the precessional motion
of a gyroscope. Not content
with knocking the wind out of
the P h y s i c s Oenartment, he pro-
ceeded to s i m i l a r l y confound
Maths by triumphantly scribb-
ling the c a l c u l a t i o n s leading to
the famous "Third Derivative"
Laithwaite joyfully twirling his gyroscope.
or "surge" and declaring the
p o s s i b i l i t y of the existence of
"complex mass" with a pro-
perty very s i m i l a r to induct-
a n c e . In a world where energy
and action divorce themselves
from momentum and reaction,
perhaps it w a s too much to
expect Professor Laithwaite to
resist rewriting the laws of
Nature; and s o he d i d . With
complex mass, Newton's Second
Law becomes
F - (m+ iAw)a
With A being the "induct-
ance", and w the angular
velocity of a rotating object.
If the equation looks familiar,
it's supposed to .Professor
Laithwaite would be the first
to point out that the re-
semblance to emf = (R - i L W)l
is not mere coincidence.
No-one who sat in P h y s i c s
Theatre 1 that afternoon could
have failed to be impressed,
whether by the nerve of the
man, the implications for
science or by the sight of the
Prof standing on the front
bench breaking every safety
rule by whirling a 24 pound
