Is ICWA to become a political organisation? This question is
being asked in earnest following Wednesday's General Meeting
at which including an action group in the constitution was prop-
osed.
A number of Icwarians
have formed a group c a l l e d
'Vtomen in S c i e n c e ' which
claims that a s it stands
ICWA does not cater enough
for the needs of women in
college, or at a l l fro some.
They suggest much more
should be done to eleviate the
problems, both s o c i a l and ac-
ademic facing women i n c o l -
lege.
T h i s idea has caused some
dissent within the ranks of
ICWA. Although most agree
that there is room for an ex-
tension of I C W A ' s a c t i v i t i e s
there are doubts about what
this would mean with regard
to the future nature of I C W A .
C o u l d ICWA become a totally
p o l i t i c a l organisation? A l -
though this seems u n l i k e l y a
lenghty d i s c u s s i o n is now i n
progress as certain members
feel ICWA i s , and should re-
main, a mainly s o c i a l body.
Whatever the outcome i t
w i l l greatly be influencedby
the results of the elections
for next years ICWA executive
w h i c h w i l l shortly take p l a c e .
Pancake Race!
THIS T U E S D A Y saw the annual ritual of the Pancake Race
around Be.t quadrangle. The actual race seemed, for the"majorit?
of the spectators, to be immaterial as they checked out unsus-
pecting passers-by to drench with dustbinfuls of cold water.
However, their fate was nothing to compare with that Of the
unfortunate E x e c u t i v e and
ICWA team members, and in
this year's race, particularly
the ICWA team. The hose
pipes were out in full force as
the President of ICWA and
later the P r e s i d e n t of I C U
soon found out.
The race was ably umpired
by Mike Williams, the E d i t o r
of F E L I X , whose unfortunate
task i t was to show the two
teams the c i r c u i t they each
h a d to run by running them
himself. He too got rather
wet.
Although the ICWA team,
initiators of the P a n c a k e R a c e
Challenge and last year's
winners, battled valiantly on-
wards, the E x e c u t i v e streaked
home to victory with only one
unfortunate mishap - that of
an ill-timed, mindless rugby
t a c k l e on the President of C
and G Union, Jenny Jones.
Although taken to hospital
after this, we are now assured
that Jerry i s in fact recovering
though badly bruised.
T h i s appeared to be the only
marring incidentof the race, and
arather jubulent Trevor P h i l l i p s
led the two teams and spect-
ators into a " H e y V ' v o ! "
A n d so ended this year's P a n -
cake Race with a w e l l earned
victory for the E x e c u t i v e .
