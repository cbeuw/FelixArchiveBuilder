1.00p.m. arrived and the
score was I . C . 1st X V 13, I . C .
E x 1st 13, I C . ' A ' X V 12. T h e
dreaded flue virus had struck
and each team found themselves
depleated. Nevertheless, we de-
c i d e d to brave these setbacks
and play three games short of
p l a y e r s . Meanwhile i n O B 2 the
virus was being reared by D e n -
s o and Tapper at the optimum
temperature of 3 5 o c
. Inside
the siveaty head of the former
was stored the information that
B o b (I rearly scored a hot trick)
A u s t i n was turning up at the
Kingston ground. T h e detailed
instruction to the ground lay
under a heap of aspirin bottles.
We eventaully arrived at the
K i n g s t o n ground to be shown to
the c h i c k e n run to change. A
frantic rush to secure their own
personal nail w a s made by the
I.C. players. B o B o roosted i n
the rafters.
T h e I.C. 1st X V started one
player short but the balance
was redressed within five min-
utes when one of the K i n s t o n
player retired to receive ten
stitches i n a l e g . During this
first h a l f the one i n two slope
proved to be of some advantage
to I.C. and within the first quar-
ter we ran up 13 points with a
Hughes penalty a n d conversion
and tries by A u s t i n and F e a r n .
It was now obvious to a l l that
there was no need to do any
more to w i n the match so tea
and b i s c u i t s were served for the
rest of the half.
Now playing up the slope
I.C. found the going much
tougher. L i p p s h a d to tighten
the string in h i s shorts to pre-
vent h i s pot dragging along the
floor and Donkey was seen to
streak up the w i n g o n h i s pongo
s t i c k . K i n g s t o n fought w e l l
driving I.C. back and had soon
'reduced the I.C. lead with a
well converted penalty goal.
T h i s pattern continued t i l l
fifteen minutes from the end
when a l l tea trolleys were c l e -
aned and I.C. started to play
a g a i n . Several excellent for-
ward rushes followed by quick
p o s s e s s i o n were not rewarded
with tries but by this time I.C.
had had their fourth try d i s a l l -
owed. It w a s left to B o B o to run
seventy yards to break the dead-
lock. T h i s w a s followed by a
Hughes try which came from a
fifty yard run by Z a p p a . T h e
f i n a l score was 21 - 3 to I.C.

Unlucky 13 - unlucky for
Kingston R . F . C . that i s . T h e
extras last Saturday went out
to Kingston with 13 men and
after getting changed in the
valuables box, we got into cars
to be taken to a disused tip to
play the 15 man opposition.
(Only got 13 - Ho H o H o I'm
going to enjoy this said their
c a p e )
The extras k i c k e d off, went
straight into the attack and
after 5 minutes H . Sayers k i c k -
ed a penalty to give us a 3 - 0
lead. Everybody defended w e l l
putting everything into their
game. M . K i l b r i d e at B l i n d side
Open Side and Number 8 h a d an
excellent game and R. Trezeas
at scrum half played w i l l with
only 6 men in front of him . T h
Then the hard work was reward-
ed with 3 more tries from %,
Whiteley, M . Gibson and M . K i l -
bride of which H . Sayer's con-
verted one, to give us a half
time lead of 1 7 - 0 .
P l a y i n g with the wind i n the
s e c o n d half we conceded a try
(unconverted) and then scored
three more tries D . Forbes,
H .Sayers and J . R o s e scoring
them and D . Forbes converting
o n e . T h i s gave us a final score
of 31 - 4.
The pack d i d w e l l to w i n set
pieces and rucks against a n 8
man pack and I must congrat-
ulate them on this. Mickey
Mouse of the opposition got
sent off near the end of the
second half for waggling h i s
ears at the ref.

M I X E D H O C K E Y
On Sunday morning the mixed hockey team met in the nauseat-
ingly odourfuI union lounge ready to travel to do battle with '
Speedbird. T h e tube journey to E a s t Hounslow was peaceful en-
ough with Mike and Janet doing the crossword together and Mark
looking on jealously . A short walk to the bus station and we were
on the way to the ground. Hav-
ing nearly got off at the wrong
stop we got out by the Queen's
H e a d .
On observing thhis building
the umpire made straight for the
bar muttering. " E S B for break-
f a s t . " A cry from the c a p t a i n /
secretary/organiser of the mix-
ed hockey club caused a halt
but after a democratic vote the
number of customers swelled by
t w e l v e .
We at last arrived at the
gro.und only to find no opposi-
tion. They evetually turned up
and we began twenty minutes
late. P l a y i n g uphill I C began
w e l l but after a while Speedbird
began to come into i t . D e s p i t e
their steady pressure they cou-
ldn't beat C h r i s Parker or P e t e
N o w e l l and when they d i d Shir-
ley " h i t it anywhere" F a i r w e a -
ther and John H u c k l e cleared up
confidently leaving the stray be-
l i s h a beacon in goal with very
little to do.
Suddenly, in the 28th minute,
the ball was smashed out of de-
fence and ended up with Dave
Balderson who put it into the
net, Silverbird replied by crash-
ing a shot against the inside
of the post but luck was with
I C and it stayed out.
I C began the second half
confidently with P e t e , Janet a n d
L i n d s a y working w e l l on the
right but as in the first h a l f
Speedbird gradually came back
biit the defence h e l d firm. Then
in the 62nd minute Chris Parker
p i c k e d up a ball i n midfield a n d
dribbled through to score a fine
g o a l . T h i s was followed four
minutes later by a goal from
M i k e " I ' v e ruptured m y s e l f '
V i e y r a with help from D i . So
when the umpire blew h i s whis-
tle for the end of the match,
I.C. had maintained their un-

2 n d X I
After a four-week period of
inaction, owing to inclement
weather conditions, the 2nd
X I took the field at Harlington
for their second match of the
term. On the coach, it was dis-
covered that we were minus two
players (Pete Nowetl and C h a s
H a r d y ) . Our esteemed (?) cap-
tain solved this problem by pre-
s s i n g the umpire (yours truly)
into service and replacing him
in h i s habitual role of full-back.
Our v i c t i m s , the Potters B a r
X I , were obviously the lesser
team. T h i s was borne out by the
fact that our first goal was sco-
red i n two minutes! From the
bully-off, the b a l l was taken up
right wing, A superb cross
found our unmarked lef* winger,
C l i v e Thomson, just inside the
' D ' . T h e latter coolly hammer-
ed the ball home. A few minutes
later, our captain Ian Read,
recovered from h i s hangover
long enough to score our sec-
ond goal in a similar style.
Potters Bar managed to
force a short corner from which
they scored. T h e third goal was
scored by Dave Balderson a n d
C l i v e Thomson got h i s second
goal just before half-time.
In the second half, Potters
Bar, hopelessly outclassed yet
again, conceded another two
?;oals. T h e first of these arose
rom a penalty stroke, ably
taken by B o b Middle*)n. H e
then scored h i s second and our
sixth goal.
The whole team played ext-
remely w e l l . T h e game was
enjoyed by a l l although the
full-backs and goalkeeper d i d
not see much of the b a l l . T h e
only regrets we had were that
neither C l i v e nor B o b scored a
" j u g " .
Our thanks must go to Mr
Jerry Jacobs for h i s efficient
umpiring of the match.
