FRIDAY 01 NOV
SPORT
Imperial has good showing at Spooky Duathlon
O
n Sunday 27th, six
fellow triathletes
(plus old boy Sam
O’Neil) took to Hyde
Park to take part in
the Jekyll and Hyde Park Halloween
Duathlon. With the clocks going back
alarms were tentatively set, not really
knowing whether we’d unknowingly
cause ourselves to turn up to the race
an hour early or not! A crucial race
banana was munched and I set oﬀ into
the rain at 6.30am with nerves and
apprehension. With this being my ﬁrst
duathlon I was relieved to be warmly
greeted at registration by chairman
Ed Hallett (he’s doing a great job, by
the way) who helped me rack my bike
into optimum streamline setup in
transition and calmed my nerves.
The course began with a 4.2 km
run lap around the serpentine. Then
a quick transition onto the bike for
a 20.8 km, 8 lap course up and down
South Carriage Drive (with nervously
wet hairpin bends at each end), and
ﬁnally a 7.6 km (two laps) run to
ﬁnish us oﬀ. After signing up for
the event, I hadn’t quite realised how
far the distances were, and although
my training had been good, it wasn’t
exactly going to be a sprint!
The aptly named Jekyll and Hyde
Park Duathlon, unlike similar races,
had a prize for the best fancy dress
costume. Brandishing our new sexy
awesome trisuits (yes, they have a lion
on the back!) we decided to ignore the
invitation for fancy dress. But there
were some excellent entries including
a road kill fox and the fancy dress
winner who had come as a devil and
even made her bike into some kind of
devil-mobile, complete with a trident!
Anyway, after a quick race brieﬁng
and reminder to not ‘accidentally’
walk oﬀ with someone else’s bike
after the race, we started. The clouds
parted and the unthinkable happened:
the sun came out! Personally, I had a
really comfortable ﬁrst lap run, which
was familiar as it’s the same as the
Vicky Solli gives her account as Imperial run against “roadkill fox”
Hyde Park Relays women’s route (an
event run by ICXC in March, everyone
should enter), and managed a pretty
seamless transition onto the bike,
where I felt pretty strong! The bike
course was surprisingly fun, especially
during my ﬁrst few laps pretending
I was racing with all the supreme
men, and had the b-e-a-utiful sound
of carbon drifting past me! After
managing to count 8 laps correctly, I
dismounted Charlie (yes, my bike has
a name) and pulled the running shoes
back on. Then my legs just seemed to
give up, and turned to lead! But true
to my style, (not great at sport, but
always give it my best shot) I plodded
round the two laps to the ﬁnish! In
reﬂection I did get a decent time and
came 33rd out of the women ﬁeld.
Having had my birthday recently, I
was lucky to get a new Garmin watch
(the 910XT) to collect data and stats
about my training and races; oh yes,
the analysis does get me excited!
Thankfully the multisport mode
worked, seamlessly changing from
one sport to another and it even
recorded my transitions. Now I can
ponder over graphs and split times to
my heart’s content, even if I do look
like “all the gear but no idea!”
Less about me, we had some great
racers out there! Milan Misak had
an absolutely awesome race coming
25th over all and proved to the carbon
junkies that you can go pretty damn
fast on a single speed! Kudos! Aimee
Di Marco also put in a great eﬀort after
coming back from injury, to come in
8th out of the women. Old boy Sam
O’Neill came along, claiming he hadn’t
done any training since his Iron Man,
which I believe was a lie as he came in
30th. Ed Hall (as Mr Hallett was for
the day) put in a supreme eﬀort on his
nearly all carbon “it only weighs 8 kg”
bike, with Marcel Admiraal and Sam
Jackson putting in sterling eﬀorts also.
Afterwards we managed to crash the
IC Cross Country and Athletics post-
Sunday long run breakfast. Cheers to
Matt Douthwaite, the fry up and cups
of tea were greatly appreciated! And
it meant we got to show oﬀ our race
t-shirts which it seems are much more
practical than medals!
So, fancy a challenge? Like to get
stuck in? And maybe are a little bit
crazy? Triathlon club is awesome!
Some really great people that support
and push each other through training,
races and the occasional party night
(we are athletes, except on Wednesday
nights, of course!) Email triath@
