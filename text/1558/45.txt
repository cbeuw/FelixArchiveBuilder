Iceland 2013: Imperial Fellwalking Tour Diary
W
e all converged
on Luton Airport
at 5 am for our
ﬂight out to
Iceland. After
checking everyone had brought all
the food and tents that they had been
given a few days previously, (they had,
apart from a couple of tins of sweet
corn) we checked in and sat down for
our last English breakfast for 10 days.
Charlie ﬁnally turned up 15 minutes
before the ﬂight left - apparently TFL
whimsically decided to cancel all his
buses.
The 3 hour ﬂight went quickly
and soon we had beautiful views of
a glacier and the rugged volcanic
coastline of Iceland. After passing
through passport and customs
without an incident we got the bus
into the capital, Reykjavik, checked
into the hostel and went about
exploring the city. We soon found the
cheapest supermarket, Bonus, and in
the evening the 12 of us sat down for
a hearty dinner to prepare us for the
week ahead.
The next morning we woke up early
togetthe8ambustoLandmannalaugar
where the start of the trail was. The
bus’s tour guide told us we were
traveling through the epicentre of an
earthquake as well as the reason why
there are so many horses in Iceland:
“The land is so cheap you can buy a
horse, if you have one horse why not 2,
and if you have two why not twenty!”
As we drove deeper into Iceland
we went oﬀ-road onto the F roads,
soon seeing a police super jeep and
a group of people raking the side of
hill! Several river crossings later we
arrived at the collection of huts at
Landmannalaugar. We however were
camping, and due to the rocky ground
we debated the merits of using pegs
or rocks to secure the tents down
– exciting stuﬀ! After having lunch
we headed oﬀ on a day walk up the
surrounds hills to stretch our leg,
and enjoyed a view of the solid lava
ﬂows beneath us. The evening was
spent relaxing in the warm natural
geothermal pool next to the campsite.
Over the next four days we walked
as planned from Landmannalaugar
to Baser. On the ﬁrst day on the trail
we walked through the lava ﬁeld and
then up and higher. We got our ﬁrst
experience of walking on the fragile
Icelandic landscape, were a footstep
on moss can easily kill it, and many
photos of the plumes of sulphuric gas
rising from the ground. The next day
saw us climbing over the snowing pass
and down to Álftinnusker. There was
a democratic mutiny at the campsite,
led by Sally, Sarah and Katharina with
the group deciding that they would
rather stay in the hut away from the
biting wind and cold than camp. After
being told by the hut warden that we
weren’t allowed up any mountains
due to the closing storm, Charlie
and I settled for a brisk run around a
nearby lake before too staying in the
warm hut. The next two days saw us
walking downhill towards Básar. Here
the scenery became less snowy and
turning into a black desert. We had
to wade several rivers, only knee deep
but very cold, creating a lot of faﬀ as
people removed their boots to cross.
Approaching Básar we walked through
the area known as “Almenningar”
with crossing the river Þröngá which
is glacier-fed but which is widely
braided at the crossing point and only
knee-deep max. The landscape and
vegetation changed rapidly during
this section—Birchwood and all kinds
of plants emerged, a welcome change
to the desert behind us. We met up
with Joe, who came bearing gifts of
chocolate, cheese and chorizo to liven
up our diet.
The next day was a relaxing rest day
for those weary from being on their
feet all day and enjoyed the bathing
pools near the hut and the warming
hot chocolate. Meanwhile some of
us walked up an exceptionally pointy
mountain – walking the furthest and
highest we had all trip but thankfully
without our heavy rucksacks. The
summit had a great view. Our 6th
and ﬁnal day of walking started early
with us climbing over 1000m passing
between the glaciers “Eyjafjallajökull”
and “Mýrdalsjökull” and climbing
Iceland’s newest hills “Magni” and
“Modi”. On the way down we passed
23 waterfalls as we approached the
ﬁnish of the trail at Skogar.
After travelling back to Reykjavik
we spent the following day driving
around the Golden Circle route seeing
the mid-Atlantic ridge in Þingvellir
and the Gullfoss waterfall, thanks to
our three drivers Sally, Jessi and Joe.
Our ﬁnal day was spent relaxing
in Reykjavik before getting the ﬂight
back to England. Many thanks to
everyone who came along and I am
sure everyone will agree it was an
amazing experience.

Brilliant start for
Water Polo team in LUSL
Alex Lloyd-Simpson
Water Polo Captain
Following the loss of many excellent
players this year, namely ex Team
GB vice-captain Adam, we were
worried we’d ﬁnd a team with as
much quality and ﬁnesse as our old
BUCS team this year. Fortunately we
did some great work at the Fresher’s
Fair and managed to recruit several
outstanding players, including some
girls who were actually familiar
with the game, which is rare. Not
to mention the guys we got, who
certainly know how to handle their
balls.
Our ﬁrst ﬁxture, last week, saw
us pitted against UCL’s 2nd team,
a team we were initially quietly
conﬁdent we would beat with ease.
As it turns out, we didn’t have to
be quiet about it at all. Final score
ending 20-2 (a huge margin for
Water Polo) in Imperial’s favour
saw some well-deserved celebratory
drinks in ULU’s “Library”. This
was the ﬁrst time our team had
played together, with many of us
not knowing each other’s names,
it is a testament to how well we
can complement and gel with each
other as a team. The match itself
began with some intimidating
synchronised stretching, led by the
“nutter” Livio, followed by some
half-arsed widths of the pool. We
scored immediately from the swim
oﬀ giving us an early lead. However
some dodgy refereeing saw UCL
quickly equalise, but that was to be
only half of their total goals scored.
Imperial soon slotted 18 more
passed them, with some cracking
shots being ﬂung in from everyone,
apart from Stuart. Only thing to
really work on was setting up a
decent arc, with most of our goals
coming from counter attacks, but
most importantly, UCL were easily
disposed of.
The next ﬁxture saw us travelling
out to St Barts in Shadwell, where
Sophie declared she felt at home once
again. Upon arrival at the pool, the
ladies had to wait to in the changing
room whilst the men only swimming
session ended, certainly a bizarre
situation for all of us. A freezing cold
pool meant actually having to do
a decent warm up for once. Wasn’t
really needed that much though as
the St Barts players were knackered
after only 2 quarters. They also had
an illegal sized squad of about 20
players (maximum allowed being
13), almost double our elite 11 we
brought along. Still, this didn’t help
them in the swimming or water
polo department. The refereeing
was also worse than the ﬁrst match,
something we didn’t think possible-
one referee was heard saying to a
teammate “can you take over, I don’t
know the rules”. Sophie was however
kind enough to explain the rules on
multiple occasions and even oﬀered
to take over refereeing duties at one
point - sadly they declined. Again
some great goals were scored, this
time even Stuart got one, and James
(not Edward) showed us all how
to properly play Water Polo after
a great drive in to pit from the arc,
ﬁring the ball past the defenceless
goalie. Despite the horrendous
rule breakages, we still won 9-1, a
commendable victory.
Next on the agenda is our raucous
tour to Aachen, Germany this
weekend which is pretty much
the highlight of the Water Polo
social calendar. We look forward
to socialising with our German
counterparts, and maybe indulging
in some Water Polo with them as
well.
