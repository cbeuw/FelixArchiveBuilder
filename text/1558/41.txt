FRIDAY 01 NOV
2011 - Global population hits 7 billion
emphasising how you and your pathetic
day-to-day existence are useless at best and
probably detrimental to the species at worst.
1986 - The M25 motorway is ﬁnally ﬁnished
oﬃcially isolating Londoners from the rest of
the UK and forever giving people an accurate
description of what constitutes ‘The North’.
1969 - First computer-to-computer link, the
ARPANET is established. Thankfully, such a
weird concept doesn’t gain any traction and
we continue to share information in digniﬁed
printed form.
1919 - Prohibition laws passed in the USA,
which, in one fell swoop, heroically ends the
twin sins of drink and crime.
1894 - Tsar Nicholas II ascends to the Russian
throne leading to years of peace, prosperity
and overall global harmony that extends to
this day.
1618 - Sir Walter Raleigh is beheaded for
allegedly conspiring against James I. Whilst
this was almost certainly not the case, it was
widely accepted that he was a bit dickhead and
so nobody really minded.
1275 - Amsterdam founded. However, as
marijuana has yet to be imported to Europe
and cheaper prostitutes found elsewhere,
the attractions of the city were few and they
quickly shut it down.

Crap Pseudo-Holiday Celebrated With Gusto
T
his Thursday, same as
every fucking year, the
shitty pseudo-holiday
— ‘Halloween’ — was
celebrated. Once again,
people dressed up in a variety of
frankly crap costumes to celebrate
something most know nothing about.
“OMG I’m having a great time”
stated one partygoer with unjustiﬁed
verve. “I really love dressing up as a
[shit] mummy and sneaking up on my

ollowing the numerous
alerts and warnings issued
for a powerful storm hitting
the UK Monday, the MET
oﬃce was quoted as saying
the storm was “suspiciously calm”.
“Yes, there were severe disruptions
to train services in the south, but
when are there not?” said a MET
Oﬃce spokesperson, before adding,
“Surely this can’t be all? This storm has
other plans.” “We’re no experts,, but
we do have a seventh sense for when
a storm’s hiding something”.
The mysterious storm - for now
at least and indeed at most - seems
to have quietened down. However,
many believe this respite to be only
temporary while the storm gathers
its cloudy minions. One south coast
resident stated that he was “going
underground” where “no storm can
hurt me”.
This reporter for one isn’t buying
the ease with which the treacherous
storm passed over and is readying
the Hangman nuclear bunker for an
extended sojourn.
[stupid] friends”.
Theholiday,forwhichthereasonsfor
its existence are widely unknown, was
extensively observed. Indeed, every
year this waste-of-a-space festivity
attracts thousands of new observants
by bribing them with sweets; once
again proving how pathetically easy
people are to manipulate.
At press time, this reporter was be-
ing forced to done a shit cape, slick
back their hair and pretend to be a
ﬁctional blood-sucking creature. How
fucking typical.

T
he Boiler – Following the
8% increase in the prices
of most energy suppliers,
this editor believes we still
aren’t paying enough for our
energy.
Whilst this increase will certainly
add a signiﬁcant amount to our yearly
bills, surely the high quality nature of
the power we receive on a daily basis is
worth this rise and more.
Indeed, it is this humble writer’s
opinion that the ~ £500 million proﬁts
most of the ‘Big 8’ make simply does
not reﬂect the fantastic services and
superiority of their energy.
For sure, these rises may well result
in people having to choose between
heating and food this winter, but
surely there is but one choice. Who’s
eating baked beans when there is such
brilliant energy to be enjoyed?
Have you looked at the gas ﬂames
recently? See how mesmerizingly blue
they are? How gently they ﬂicker in a
draught? And sockets, they’re great.
Just think about it, you stick in the
plug and get an unceasing, rhythmic
alternative current out. This journalist
would pay just about every penny he
had just for that experience.
This is where our reporter must
disagree with our Great Leader Mr
Cameron when He says people should
just “put on a [fucking] jumper”.
Take oﬀ your jumpers, t-shirts and
trousers; whack up the heating; eat
your toenails, because this energy’s
worth it.

Storm Calm,
Too Calm
The M25 acting as both a fortress for the city of London
against the Great Unwashed of the rest of the UK as well
as a convenient measure of which areas of the country in
the North and which in the South.
Seriously, what the fuck does this
even mean? If this evokes any kind of
holiday-sentiment in you, youʼre fuck-
ing banned from reading Hangman
ever again you weird fucker.
