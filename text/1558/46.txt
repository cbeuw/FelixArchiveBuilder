CUAFC 5’s set oﬀ on the
long trip to North London on
Saturday for a matchup against
London rivals RUMS 3’s.
The team’s arrival at Shenley
was excitedly received by veteran
footballer and long-time IC 5’s fan
Gianfranco Zola. Unfortunately
captain Clarke couldn’t ﬁt him into
the team in place of the technically
superior Deasy, and he was forced to
watch from the stands.
A distinctly non-cagey ﬁrst 10 minutes
saw IC getting in behind the RUMS
full backs and creating a whole host
of chances. A lack of clinical ﬁnishing
had already caused the 5’s downfall
in previous games, and nerves began
to show as RUMS started to get into
the match. With 25 minutes gone,
Nicholls ﬂashed a header across the
face of goal from a wicked Aguilera
in-swinging corner – showing the
world that her left foot is miles
better than her vocal ability. Minutes
later another set piece delivery from
Aguilera dropped to Deasy 6 yards
out, who ﬁercely struck the ball
towards goal. Unfortunately for him,
full back Krol was too busy applying
fake tan and considering his latest
modelling contract to get out of the
way, duly blocking it on the goal line.
The loose ball was cleared to the edge
of the box where Clarke was lurking
to riﬂe it into the top left hand corner.
Despite the 1-0 advantage IC took
into the half time break, the team
were insistent that the score line was
still 0-0. Yet it wasn’t long before a
Nicholls free kick sent to the back
stick was nodded across goal by Clarke
and, after pinball in the 6 yard box,
tucked past the keeper by late call up
Stilwell. Stilwell then turned provider
for IC’s third, sending a corner high
and long where Rowley gambled
marvellously at the back stick to ﬁzz
home a classy ﬁnish on the volley.
After his goal line block earlier in
the game, Krol had the chance to
redeem himself as the ball fell to him
a yard out from another menacing
corner. Getting his shoulders back
and lifting his head are two things
that might look good on camera, but
neither of them helped him here as
he blazed the ball well over the bar
when it was probably easier to score.
A brief scare followed this as Klottka
and Yeoh’s oﬀside trap was broken
for the ﬁrst time by the RUMS centre
forward. Having not seen the ball all
game, however, his touch was rustier
than Grant Holt’s treadmill, and the
onrushingHaas-Hegereﬃcientlydealt
with the danger. Minutes later, another
hopeful long ball was cleared again
by the German keeper, only for him
to collide with the RUMS number 9.
Unlike in recent history, it was the
German who came out on top as he
continued to play on, despite being
out by a factor of 4 when asked how
many ﬁngers he could see in front of
him. The centre forward whose elbow
he had aggressively head-butted
bizarrely limped oﬀ the ﬁeld despite
no clear damage to either leg, and
with no remaining substitutes RUMS
were forced to play on with 10 men.
It wasn’t long before their distinct
lack of footballing ability was made
even more apparent by the missing
player, but the ferocious Sang Woo
wasn’t happy with just the one man
advantage as he looked to stamp his
impact on the game. Eventually good
interplay down the right hand side
from the tireless Han and man of
the match Aguilera led to substitute
Petersen bearing down on goal and
slotting the ball home to seal the
result. After such a comprehensive
and eﬃcient victory, not even the lack
of post-match treat could dampen the
spirits of the players as they returned,
triumphant, to West London.

Cricket: Imperial
lose to UCL
On Saturday 26th October, Imperial
College 1st XI travelled to the Uni-
versity of East London’s SportsDock
centre to play in the ﬁrst round of
games of the BUCS Indoor Tourna-
ment. Our ﬁrst game was scheduled
to be against LSE but our opposi-
tion forfeited the game, handing us
our ﬁrst points of the competition.
Whilst this was a positive start, it
took away the opportunity for vital
match practice going into the sec-
ond ﬁxture of the day, against UCL
1st XI.
Imperial won the toss and elected to
ﬁeld ﬁrst, in order to gauge an idea
of how to approach the run chase,
and UCL got oﬀ to a relatively quick
start, scoring 47 oﬀ 4 overs. But, due
to a disciplined bowling eﬀort from
Mohit Kulkarni, Zain Rizvi and Vi-
nay Babla, UCL were not able to
accelerate at the end of the innings,
losing their last 3 wickets for 0 runs,
and ﬁnishing with an average score
of 104 oﬀ their 10 overs.
During the interval, captain Vignesh
Venkateswaran spoke about the
need for a sensible approach towards
the run chase, as the total was not
daunting in any respect. However,
Imperial got oﬀ to the worst possible
start with Vishal Nair being bowled
oﬀ the ﬁrst ball of the innings. Im-
perial then lost incoming batsmen
Mohit Kulkarni for 1 and Zain Rizvi
(6) soon after that. It then took a
captain’s eﬀort from Viggy (25) to
steady the ship, together with Juhin
Patel (19) and soon Imperial needed
35 runs oﬀ the last 2 overs, a gettable
target given the indoor scoring sys-
tem, but unfortunately the last wick-
et fell soon after this, which meant
Imperial conceded defeat to UCL by
31 runs. A disappointing result for
Imperial, especially given the talent
within the team, but we will come
back strongly for the next round in
late November, hopefully with some
more experience under our belt.
Result:
UCL 104-6 beat Imperial 73-6 by 31
runs.
