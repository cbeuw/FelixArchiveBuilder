An 80km jaunt in Wales
A
s most regular runners
will testify, there comes
a point when having
followed a routine
for a long time, you
feel compelled to mix things up and
try something new. It’s the runner’s
mid-life crisis. This seems reasonable
analogy for it involves committing to
something rash, a bad idea. For me this
was entering the Wye Valley Ultra, an
80 km race through the mountains of
mid-Wales. Several months on from
the seemly harmless entry form, the
day came along, bringing with it the
task of completing a race just shy
of two marathons, with over 200m
of vertical ascent to contend with.
My student tendencies eliminated
thoughts of pre-race nerves when I
realised that a 3am alarm was required
to make the 7.30am start time. Silver
linings in everything...
In hindsight it was an event in
four parts. For the initial 2-3 hours
I was in race mode. While being a
novice at ultra running training had
progressed and I wanted to push for
as good a ﬁnish as possible. A lot of
concentration went into adhering
to a nutrition programme, which
involved eating approximately 50g
of carbohydrate and drinking 400mL
per hour. This I split into roughly half
hourly ‘meals’, which dually served
the purpose of dividing the overall
task with making it easier to ‘stomach’
while running..
Stage one ended at about 35km when
I was in a group of three, who were a
minute down on the leader. Having
felt good heretofore, I began to cramp,
dramatically reducing my speed.
A gem of Imperial-induced maths
informed me that this regression
had pushed my ﬁnish time up from
8 hours to 10. A depressing thought!
Giving up wasn’t an option as too
many people knew I was racing, thus I
convinced myself that ignoring cramp
was preferable to inevitable abuse
I would take if I assigned a ‘DNF’ to
my name. For 90 minutes this struggle
continued; I would be lying if I said
it fun. Despite this I was conﬁdent
that my problem was nutrition-based
through muscular-electrolyte deﬁcit
rather than ﬁtness.
I reached a point where I could
speed up without cramping. At this
point I felt I was riding the crest of a
wave. Feeling that I could run freely
gave me a lift and the whole venture
seemed like a better idea than it
had beforehand. The miles began to
tick oﬀ faster and with them came
progress back up the leader board.
The next few hours (I can honestly
say) were truly glorious, basking
in the freedom of running through
stunning environments, untouched
and untroubled by the outside world.
It was almost spiritual in a way, being
so completely isolated in my own
little bubble, just letting my mind
wander whilst I passed lakes, through
valleys and over mountains. The one
issue was the diﬃculty of adhering
to my eating plan. Having been out
for over 5 hours, postulating whether
I was suﬃciently fuelled became
increasingly diﬃcult.
The ﬁnal stage approached at the
60km point. By now the euphoria of
previous hours had dissipated. For the
ﬁrst time I was dealing with the issue
of muscular fatigue. To put it mildly
my legs were ‘pretty’ sore. The balance
was that I was within a distance to the
ﬁnish that, barring injury, I would be
able overcome. I had also raced up the
leader board. The mental battle was
forcing myself to push as much as I
could in order to ‘break’ those behind
me.
Unlike the opening stages where
I raced feeling fresh, I was now ‘red-
lining’ – going as fast as I could for
the given distance left. This became
a battle between two contrasting
voices in my head but I managed
to hold it together, using a series of
mental hurdles to focus away from
the fatigue. I also thought about the
prospective outcome and all the
input training. Spotting the ‘200m
to go’ sign was a relief. Crossing the
line I did had an immense sense of
satisfaction and pride, completing the
race in 8 hours 11 minutes and 6th out
of the 130 starters. It was an enjoyable
experience due to the surroundings
where it took place. It provided
interest and inspiration, making it a
pleasure (in the main) in which to be
a part. Ultimately, it was an example
of the value of spending time outdoors
and protecting those environments.
Capitalising on the opportunity
I urge you all to attend the London
Climate Forum, a sustainability
conference centred on prospective
anthropogenic eﬀects. It will be a great
event with fantastic speakers. It takes

T
he British Monarchy as
an institution is, we can
all agree, quintessentially
British, deﬁned by
political impotence, with
a history of starting needless wars to
satisfy stupid demands. A historical
anachronism allowed to be a part of
the elite out of politeness, with the
mind to its occasional utility. The
US needed Britain’s support during
Iraq, to pretend it wasn’t the only
‘democracy’ going to ﬁght there
uh, for democracy, and the British
Government sometimes needs the
Royal Family to throw a good party.
Because these are times of austerity!
Wait…
So, forget the convenient Royal
decrees that allow the government to
overrule Supreme Court judgements,
used to quash the claims of the
forcefully displaced Chagos Islanders;
forget the fact that royalty is a remnant
of a horribly repressive, backwards
and cruel historical era. Forget that
the royalty own vast tracts of land,
bought with tax-payers’ money.
Forget that the symbolic eﬃcacy of
the Royal Family has variously been
used to support raving nationalism
(think Yukio Mishima and his
Cultural Emperor, or World War
Japan generally). The Queen appeared
in Danny Boyle’s James Bond sketch
at the Olympics. And sure Charles
looks like a horse, but Princess D was
an angel, wasn’t she? Look at all that
charity stuﬀ she probably did. And
the poor sons, ordinary guys forced
into such a hard position, the whole
world watching. No wonder they go to
parties dressed as Nazis, it’s the stress,
poor things! And then isn’t Kate so
good looking and clever, and a normal
human being too. Those Royals can’t
be all bad if they marry normal human
beings. Plus they bring in tourist
money.
You see that last bit is crucial. Most
people aren’t willing to support the
royal family without some apparent
utilitarian calculation. They say,
‘No I don’t think we really need a
monarchy, but they make us lots of
tourist money and it would be a pity
to lose it’. Fair enough, these are times
of austerity! So okay, keep the Royal
Family. I understand that they make
a lot of money for us. I don’t know
how anyone calculated exactly how
much tourist money we would lose
if the Royal Family disappeared, but
economists are clever. Take the IMF: if
unemployment really didn’t exist, their
models would be perfect! Anyway, the
Royal family makes Britain money.
But, let’s reorganise a bit so we can
make more tourist money. These are
times of austerity. A Royal Family
Big Brother perhaps? A sort of
Buckingham Palace zoo, where we
can see Charles having his Duchy
original blood-of-virgins-or-whatever
jam for breakfast, the Queen on the
toilet awnd Prince Phillip being racist
to the assembled crowds? The Only
Way is Sandringham House? It sounds
ghastly to me, but then, I never did
watch reality TV. At the very least it
sounds like it will sell.
