SCIENCE
Laurence Pope on recent research into the humble honeybee
The chaos of colony collapse disorder
CSIRO AUSTRALIA
T
he modern-day bee is in
a bit of a sticky situation,
and we’re not talking about
honey.
It was published in
PLoS One last week that scientists
discovered a mass-extinction of one
bee group, Xylocopinae, at around
the same time the dinosaurs punched
out of the biological timeline. This
extinction is believed to be linked to
the extinction of many ﬂowering plant
species. Speed forward 65 million
years or so and we’ve got another bee
problem: colony collapse disorder
(CCD).
You could write a dissertation on
colony collapse disorder (and indeed
I actually have), but it can be boiled
down to a few simple facts. Back in late
2006 US beekeepers noticed that their
hives were devoid of large numbers
of worker bees, even dead ones. The
bees had seemingly vanished. Over
six years on and it’s still a problem
across a lot of the world, including
the US, Europe and parts of Asia. Bee
populations are crashing, and no-
one’s quite sure why.
Several competing hypotheses
have been put forward. Some blame
a group of pesticides known as
neonicotinoids, a class of neuroactive
agents introduced in the early 1990s.
Neonicotinoids have low toxicity in
mammals, and at the time seemed
a good alternative to more toxic
pesticides being used. And although
they’re quite good at killing pests
they’re apparently also quite good
at disrupting the bee’s in-built
navigation system. The EU recently
imposed a ban, although the jury’s still
out amongst scientists whether or not
neonicotinoids are a major culprit in
CCD.
Other blame the aptly named
Varroa destructor, a parasitic mite
that attaches to bees and inadvertently
spreads viruses to its host, weakening
the bee’s immune system. Even
more factors have been brought into
question, including the monoculture
nature of farming, climate change,
other pathogens and malnutrition.
No single factor has been conclusively
singled out as the major causative
agent of CCD, but like many complex
ecological phenomena CCD is likely
the outcome of a mixture of these
issues. There will be no silver bullet.
The consequences of CCD extend
far beyond a potential shortage
of honey and pretty ﬂowers. Bees
contribute billions to the economy
via their ability to pollinate crops.
Without them the pollination of many
crops would need to occur by hand,
an expensive and time-consuming
process that would very likely impact
overall crop yield.
And so research continues. For the
sake of both the human race and the
beleaguered bee one hopes solutions
will soon be found.

CCD has destroyed over 10 million honeybee hives and caused over US$2million in damage
M
oney doesn’t grow
on trees, said every
person ever, but it
turns out that isn’t
entirely accurate.
There’s gold in them thar hills, or
rather, in them thar trees. Scientists
have struck gold – surprisingly in the
leaves, twigs and bark of eucalyptus
trees in Western Australia.
A group of researchers from the
Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and
Industrial Research Organisation
(CSIRO) made the discovery recently
and published their ﬁndings in the
journal Nature Communications.
They say that the roots of the trees
act like a ‘hydraulic pump’, taking up
tiny ions of gold tens of metres within
the soil below as they gather water.
Particularly in drought conditions
roots can reach up to 35 metres deep
into the soil.
The gold is transported up
through the tree by the vasculature
system, replacing water lost through
transpiration. Most likely toxic to
the plant, the gold is then moved to
leaves and branches in order to reduce
deleterious biochemical reactions.
These can eventually be shed, thereby
removing the gold.
Going to Australia to chop down
trees that you can then trade to a
cash-for-gold website when your
student loan runs out isn’t a feasible
way to make a quick buck however.
The amount of gold particles found
in the trees is miniscule. Dr Melvyn
Lintern, one of the geochemists who
authored the paper, said, “We’ve done
a calculation, and found that we need
500 trees growing over a gold deposit
to have enough gold in the trees
themselves to make a gold ring.”
ThescientistsusedtheMaiadetector
for x-ray elemental imagining at the
Australian synchrotron to visualise the
particulate gold. “This is a ﬁrst,” said
Dr Lintern. “We know that gold occurs
in leaves but this is the very ﬁrst time
that gold has been found as a visible
particle in any biological material, let
alone leaves. Any biological material
at all.” A Eureka! moment indeed.
Let’s note though that this research
will not prompt an old-school gold
rush. The nuggets of gold are one-
ﬁfth of the diameter of a human
hair – genuinely invisible to other
equipment. But this could herald the
beginning of a golden era for mineral
prospecting. Nowadays most easy-
access gold deposits have been found
all around the world. Deposits are
now detected by exploratory drilling,
or by ﬁnding a location where gold
ore appears on the Earth’s surface.
Analysing vegetation above ground
and discovering gold could indicate
buried treasure tens of metres below.
“Not only do we believe it is a way
of stretching the exploration dollar
further,” said Dr Lintern, “because
exploring for these deposits can be
quite expensive, it also minimises the
damage to the environment because
we are taking a very small sample
from the trees themselves, as well as
the leaves and twigs on the ground.
“The leaves could be used in
combinationwithothertoolsasamore
cost eﬀective and environmentally
friendly exploration technique,”
Such a method would go some way
towards addressing the problems of
declining supply and quality alongside
increasing demand for gold. There is
also the possibility that the technique
could be adapted to identify other
mineral deposits, such as zinc and
copper.
