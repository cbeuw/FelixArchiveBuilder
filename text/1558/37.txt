eet Professor Lord Robert Winston.
Attend a grand ﬁnal in a prestigious
location. Win a slice of a prize pot of
over £4000.
These chances have one factor in common: this
year’s RCSU Science Challenge. It’s big and it’s
back, launching on December 3 in SAF. You
should come to the launch event and accept the
challenge oﬀered to you. Here’s why.
The Science Challenge is the RCSU’s annual
competition. It’s the perfect opportunity for you
to communicate science in an engaging, concise
and fun manner. Four high proﬁle judges will
set three essay questions and a task for a video
category.
Every year the selected judges give up their time
to talk at the launch and grand ﬁnal events, and
chose the overall winners. They are leaders in their
ﬁelds: academia, science, journalism, business.
Last year the Director of Grantham Institute for
Climate Change, Professor Sir Brian Hoskins,
judged one question. The year before Wellcome
Trust Head of Communications and former
Science Editor of the Times Mark Henderson was
involved.
Lord Winston is the leading judge. He should be
a familiar face from British television. You might
have seen him on campus since he’s Emeritus
Professor of Fertility Studies here at Imperial, but
having been here for three years and only seen
the back of his suit once I don’t think it likely. At
the launch you’ll deﬁnitely get to see his face and
hear his voice, live. You could get a photograph of
yourself with him at the grand ﬁnal next year.
The Science Challenge is generously sponsored.
Previous winners have received tours of CERN in
Switzerland and big cash prizes. In 2014 it could
be you walking away with such treats because
all Imperial students can enter the competition,
regardless of faculty. Even if you hate the RCSU
how could you pass up the opportunity to win
potentially thousands of pounds? I’m going to
guess no one hates the RCSU that much. Not even
CGCU students.
Keep an eye out for more Science Challenge
details in Felix over the next few Fridays. Look out
for our posters around campus, updated weekly.
Keep December 3 free in your diary. There will be
free food and entertainment at the launch before
the questions and prizes are announced. The
guest speaker has an exciting history and the talk
will be worth hearing.
The Science Challenge is coming. Are you ready?
Tweet @RCSU with the hashtag #SciChal to keep
the mystery alive.
Smoky not Smudgy
Nida Mahmud on this Sundayʼs ladies only event
As Charity Week draws to an end, this
Sunday marks the return of Smoky Not
Smudgy (SnS); this is a ﬂagship ladies only
pampering event.
SnS is run by the ladies for the ladies.
All proceeds go towards the Charity Week
campaign, ultimately helping orphans and
needy children in the poorest parts of the
world. Last year, over 400 ladies attended
SnS and over £6000 was raised; this year it
is even bigger and better. So make sure you
don’t miss out.
Hiba Saleem, one of the organisers of SnS
commented: “Now in its 6th year, SnS is a
ladies-only day of complete luxury services,
beauty treatments, fashion boutiques,
photography studios, a souk bazaar, master
classes by skilled professionals, tutorials by
industry experts and two show stopping
fashion shows! Ladies, indulge yourselves
guilt-free because all the money you pay
to pamper yourself crazy will go straight
to charity! This year the fashion shows will
feature ﬁfteen exciting designers with a
show stopping collection”.
There will also be celebrities doing master
classes, beauty experts doing tutorials,
as well as hairstylists, makeup artists and
bloggers. There are many surprises in
store too. The organisers have said you can
“indulge in a makeover with a photo-shoot,
relax with our professional masseuse, get
your hands on the latest jewellery, clothes,
accessories, hijabs and much more! Have
your nails and henna done, pamper yourself
with a facial, join in on our arabic art and
cupcake classes! Find out more at www.
facebook.com/smokynotsmudgy”
Ruby Hakim has organised SnS three
times in the past. She commented that
“having attended the past 5 smoky not
smugdy events, I can tell you ﬁrst hand that
its the most fun day in the calendar! The
turnout is always impressive and the event
content is even more impressive. Every year
since its birth, SnS has reached new heights
and as a past SnS organiser with very high
standards for the event, I can reassure you
that this year’s Smoky not Smudgy will be
the best ever. I’ve been refraining from
shopping in the past month because I know
I’ll ﬁnd lots of great one-oﬀ items from the
SnS souk, as I always do! The fashion show
is always the most exciting and buzzing part
of the day. This year, the rumour is there are
two fashion shows. The excitement is almost
too much for me! I couldn’t imagine missing
SnS, it’s not even an option!”
So girls, make sure you don’t miss out!
