Confessions of a GTA: Part 4
A
s an undergrad, ﬁeld
trips were always best in
hindsight. Those hours
on a windblown moor
in the back of beyond
in the pouring rain seemed later like
quite a laugh and that time you nearly
got impaled on machinery by an irate
Scottish factory worker who did not
care how interested you were in the
manufacturing was, looking back, an
“adventure”. The stress of ﬁnishing
notes, living with some random
on your course who you had never
heard speak until now, and trying
to understand what exactly your
Professor was yelling over a gale force
wind, for most people were the good
times of the course. I, as a keen indoor
sportsman, remember it without the
rose tint.
You can imagine my horror when
my supervisor looked hopefully across
the desk from me, having indicated he
really could use help on this trip which
was, of course, over the weekend.
Battered by his assurances that it never
rained on this trip and thinking of it
as a paid day out, I resignedly agreed.
I immediately went and cleared the
sale of the closest outdoor shop just
in case.
So there I stood, handing out notes
to people I did not know at 8am
on a very cold Saturday morning.
The weather forecast was stormy. I
tried desperately to work out how
much I would be paid every second
only to realise that actually made it
more depressing. Then suddenly we
were all on the coach, setting oﬀ to a
hellish nowhere to look at nothing in
particular.
But to my surprise, I did not have
to look at nothing in particular,
make notes on something I did not
understand, or try and draw a picture
of a piece of equipment whose purpose
was not entirely clear. Instead I got to
stand at the back of a well-behaved
group of people, being plied with tea
and chocolate by the other lecturers
on the trip. I did not even have to
worry about timings or the teaching.
This the staﬀ assured me was their
problem. My main purpose seemed
to be to prevent the students walking
into the road, which they managed
pretty well on their own, with only one
or two near death incidents.
It turned out to, be quite sunny and
I could even remove my nice new
microﬂeece, hat, waterproof trousers
and gloves and pretend I was on the
beach. This was great and was rapidly
improved by a very nice three course
dinner in the hotel. I even got my
own room. Yes, it was not a hotel
that I would have picked by myself,
but hey, I was being paid for this.
Not to mention the slightly random
layout meaning that my bathroom
was huge, actually massive. So a nice
free dinner and pint later I could quite
comfortably fall asleep in front of the
TV.
I could get used to ﬁeld trip GTAing.

Boris: Resolute Vertebrate Jelly Part II
“If the ball came loose from the back
of the scrum, which it won’t of course,
it would be a great, great thing to have
a crack at.
”
T
hese were the words of Boris
Johnson on a hypothetical
bid for The Conservative
Party leadership, speaking to
the BBC’s Michael Cockerell
for a May 2013 broadcast. Their
light-hearted ﬂippancy is somewhat
endearing but they also conjure
images of the home counties. This
cannot be avoided.
One cannot fault the apparent gusto
with which Boris Johnson approaches
his mayorship. His ‘9- point plan for
a Greater London’ was both succinct
and pragmatic. Perhaps (in my view)
this is the crux of any criticism that
might be directed towards him. His
delineation of London’s foibles may
prove to be a gross oversimpliﬁcation
of a vastly complex social and
economic focal point; Boris Johnson
tends to focus on the latter. While
his pledge to create 200,000 jobs, as
a conduit for raising citizens out of
poverty, is a noble endeavour, it could
be misconstrued as clandestine and
disengaged.
London is not a ﬁctional metropolis
like Gotham City, where criminality
is asphyxiated and bludgeoned into
submission. Neither will a punctual
transport network remedy all
problems. These are isolated solitudes
in themselves. They are desirable but
without a focal point their full impact
will be lost. In London complications
are not black and white. There is only
grey.
Consider Mr. Johnson’s pledge
to create more ‘green space’ for
Londoners. It makes sense. By deﬁning
regionsforrespite,cityhallcanprovide
more opportunities for the average
‘Londoner’ to withdraw from a myriad
of pressures. This may catalyse social
cohesion, promote tolerance and
encourage patience. My criticism of
the measure is its lack of focus. Green
spaces are a means to an end; they are
not an end in themselves. Any beneﬁts
would need to be led by the people.
An inherent social link to the land
would need to be forged. Green space
in Peckham, Lewisham or Lambeth
will solve nothing in isolation. Instead,
by fashioning a cultural link to the
localised community, the beneﬁts
could prove boundless.
A recurrent characteristic of
these social links is longevity. This
is something that London typically
lacks. As a burgeoning hive of
causality, activity is both ﬂuid and
dynamic. Continuity of Government,
justice and equality will not maintain
itself without the intervention of
city hall. The Mayor’s 200,000 job
pledge is noble. Despite this one
might choose to note Boris Johnson’s
support of free markets and energetic
capitalism. There is no doubt that
the jobs will come. My concern is
that the enterprising entrepreneurs
and businesses will glaze over the
disenfranchised or impoverished
Londoner. The spider’s web proves
to be a most ﬁtting analogy. Canary
Wharf, Pall Mall and Mayfair may
lie on the strands of the web but
other areas ﬁll the void. Without an
egalitarian eﬀort to bring jobs to one
and all this may continue to be the
case. By 2015 city hall may run the
risk of morphing a sizeable income
disparity into an irrecoverable void.
This leads into City Hall’s
endeavours to rejuvenate transport.
The Crossrail project, in combination
with the proposed airport on the
Thames estuary and the hypothetical
‘Heathwick’ rail link show that eﬀorts
are both concentrated and eﬃcient. In
particular, with the Crossrail tunnel
having reached the half-way house
under Gospel Oak, Boris Johnson
can now exhibit active substance
to complement his initiatives.
Once again I bring you back to the
‘web’ analogy. The projects serve as
conduits to speed ﬁnanciers, scientists
and the well-endowed among us onto
bigger and better things. The poor are
left in idleness. The counterpoint to
this might be that such an approach
serves as a stepping stone to outreach.
I suspect that this won’t happen.
Soaring London Underground fares
may serve as substance to this instinct.
The lines may have been rejuvenated
and the trains made punctual during
Boris Johnson’s premiership but this
has happened in line with such fares.
The poor man is short of options and
ﬁnds his way barred.
Reﬂections on the London 2012
Olympic Games serve as a suitable
closing point. I once referred to their
legacy as ‘ﬂat-packed’. At the close
of the games the gates were locked
and barred and decommissioning
began without pause for breath. Bike
lanes became a thing of the past and
bidding for the Stadium gathered
force. This might be regarded as a
missed opportunity for City Hall.
There was an opportunity to fashion a
utilitarian model for London centred
on cycling, culture and sport. It was
a shame that short-term pragmatism
took precedence over a deeply-rooted
legacy.
It is not too late. If anyone can pull it
oﬀ, it is Boris Johnson.
