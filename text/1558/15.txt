NHM’s wildlife photography never gets old
Inside the home of architect Norman Swann
T
he Scandinavian duo Elmgreen
and Dragset’s Tomorrow
exhibition is quite unlike
anything else you would likely
come across in the rest of the
V&A. Everything is arranged to be
touched, to be rummaged through. It
places the viewer in the role of voyeur,
passing uninvited through the house
of Norman Swann, an aging, failed
architect.
Venture in, and you will ﬁnd
yourself in suspended animation,
transported into a ﬂat that could
belong behind any of the closed doors
in South Kensington. The entrance
hall is austere, dimly lit, and richly
decorated, yet looks lived-in. There
are brown shoes lined up by the
doorway; a yellow post-it note on the
ornate mirror demands the electricity
bill be paid.
A doorway leads to a large living
room, decorated with an odd mix of
inherited antiques and rather more
modern fare. A crude plaster statue of
a giant head stands guard to a wall-to-
wall bookcase, ﬁlled with red leather-
bound books and vases and ﬁgurines
that could be worth quite a bit. But
the plaster is moulding where the
water pipe has leaked, there are cold
ashes from a cigar in the ash tray, and
congealing coﬀee at the bottom of a
cup, abandoned on the table. There is
a musty feel to these rooms, a seeping
sense of neglect, of a house haunted
by its once grand past. A small boy
in a school uniform cowers in the
ﬁreplace. Could he be a resident? A
huge painting of the same child hangs
just above; a memory then, perhaps a
ghost.
Past a closed door behind which
a shower is perpetually running,
the grand rooms give way to a badly
reﬁtted modern kitchen. Domino’s
pizza boxes are piled up in a corner,
and packing boxes ﬁlled with
paintings and antiques occupy much
of the room. Half-ﬁnished cardboard
models of tower blocks and modern
buildings balance precariously around
the adjoining study. A bowl is stuﬀed
with room service bills from a New

N
ow in its 49th year, the
Wildlife Photographer
of the Year exhibition
has recently returned
to its original habitat the Natural
History Museum. It showcases 100
photographs of the world around us
that most will hardly ever get an actual
glimpse of.
First time visitors should prepared
to be surprised, amazed, and
extremely moved by the forces of
nature on display. Third or fourth
time visitors however – although
the quality of photographs has not
declined compared to previous years
–will probably not be able to help but
compare the 2013 images to former
favourites, and past themes.
What everyone should expect
though are massive crowds on
weekends, breathing down your neck
as you struggle on tiptoe to view the
pictures. Take advantage of being a
student and go on a free period.
The unoﬃcial ‘most popular animal’
crown has been taken from last year’s
polar bear (which surprisingly only
features in one photo this year) and
has instead been given to the dugong,
which is celebrated in no fewer than
three images by Douglas Seifert.
But rather than being repetitive and
tedious, each image exposes a slightly
diﬀerent side to the sweet thing.
The ﬁrst of these images at ﬁrst
seems odd, full of swimmers that
should not feature, only for the viewer
to realise that they in fact demonstrate
the human threat we cannot seem to
help but burden onto everything we
touch. The divers appear to physically
loom over the creature, blocking out
the beautiful sunlight shining onto it.
The second image is a cheeky dugong
creating pressure waves for two tiny
yellow ﬁsh to ride along in front of it.
The third dugong in Seifert’s trilogy is
a cute hoover, sucking up sea-grass on
a shallow bay.
Such images are perfect examples of
how every piece in the exhibit to tell
its own magniﬁcent story, and no two
are ever the same. They are so well
captioned that viewers can’t help but
stop and read about every last detail,
from how the photographer took
the shot to the judges’ opinion and
the biological description of what it
represents.
Other favourites I personally like
to spot are the “I had to lie in the
snow / underwater / in the wind and
rain for ten hours until suddenly X
animal popped out and by chance I
managed to take this amazing shot”
explanations. Other mainstays of the
exhibition include cacti under the
desert stars, the Northern Lights,
an uncomfortable polar bear (the
quintessential symbol of climate
change), the wise old monkey, the
ﬁghting animal pair, and the black and
white ﬂock of birds always exploited in
the shop on some gift wrap.
It is also fun to annually complain
very loudly that the judges obviously
picked the wrong winner, and that this
commended photograph should have
won not that atrocious unoriginal
piece (which is usually by no means
actually atrocious).
Perhaps it is not so fun to see the age
17 and under section, and realise you
are only just avoiding being a waste of
space, whilst marvelling at the work of
photographers sometimes half your
age or younger. Some in this section
are even more impressive than the
adult entries. A personal favourite
from 10 years and under includes
Peacock at Sunrise by Louis Pattyn.
A ﬁnal note for the trypophobics
among you – be ready to avert your
eyes, as repeating patterns such
as reptilian and amphibian scales,
or ﬂocks of birds from afar, are
commonplace in the exhibition. But
most pictures are void of them and it
deﬁnitely is worth seeing, even if you
do physically gag at the sight of such
things.

York Hotel (eggs, OJ and coﬀee). A
large stuﬀed vulture looms over the
desk.
Throughout the ﬂat the atmosphere
is expectant, as if some great drama
is about to unfold. Indeed, the set of
rooms, carefully installed in the V&A’s
old Tapestry gallery, is apparently
the set for “Tomorrow; Scenes from
an unrealised ﬁlm by Elmgreen and
Dragset”– the script can be found
in small books by the entrance. But
the sense of reality evoked by the
installation is so vivid that by the time
I had made my way to the bedroom,
with its rumpled unmade sheets,
such a sense of character and place
had taken root that it seemed hard
to remember that Norman Swann
was ﬁctitious, and not simply in the
shower.
Michael Elmgreen and Ingar
Dragset have created an installation
anyone could spend hours in. There
is such richness and depth in the
rooms they have created for the
ﬁctional protagonist, that leaving
Norman’s Swann home via a door in
the bookshelves, only to ﬁnd the bare
bones of wooden set pieces on the
outside and not the solid plastered
walls of a grand South Kensington ﬂat,
is quite jarring.
It is a remarkable installation that
considers the objects that we ﬁll our
lives with, and the clues we leave to
our thoughts and circumstances in
the spaces we occupy; a fantastic
introduction to the duo’s bold and
innovative work.
