Premier League
Predictions
James White
Football Columnist
Cardiﬀ vs Swansea
(Sunday 4pm, Sky Sports 1)
David Marshall’s heroics in goal have
won Cardiﬀ several points so far and
the Bluebirds will be hard to break
down again, but, without midweek
Europa League commitments,
Michael Laudrup can galvanise the
Swans to earn bragging rights in
Wales.
Prediction: 0-1
Everton vs Tottenham
(Sunday 1:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
It is remarkable how Roberto
Martinez has managed to improve
the side he inherited from David
Moyes. On a shoestring budget, he
has engineered numerous successful
summer signings and the Lukaku loan
deal was a real coup. Spurs have been
solid but not spectacular recently so
I am backing a repeat of last year’s
scoreline here. Back Lukaku to feature
on the scoresheet.
Prediction: 2-1
Arsenal vs Liverpool
(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
Oﬀensively, both these sides have
been outstanding so far, as reﬂected
by their commanding positions
in the league. However, Liverpool
are not insurmountable away and
have conceded 5 goals in the last 3
matches, while Arsenal lost at home
to Dortmund and looked a little
vulnerable against Crystal Palace.
This should be a fascinating contest
and I can’t call whether Suarez and
Sturridge or Giroud and Ozil will be
the diﬀerence.
Prediction: 1-1
Newcastle vs Chelsea
(Saturday 12:45pm, BT Sport 1)
The Magpies would probably beneﬁt
from lining up defensively against
Chelsea, who have come out on top
in open, expansive games against
Norwich and Cardiﬀ recently, as well
as in Europe. But their own strengths
lie in attack with Remy, Cabaye
and Ben Arfa so Alan Pardew has a
decision to make. In front of 52,000
Geordies, I expect him to play a high
line and for Newcastle to be picked oﬀ
on the break.
Prediction: 1-2
Best of the rest
(Saturday 3pm unless stated)
Fulham vs Man United
Craven Cottage is not the easiest place
to go, but David Moyes simply cannot
aﬀord to drop more points here. It is
in defence that United have mostly
struggled, so it’s just as well that their
Crystal Palace win aside, Fulham’s
own strikeforce has not really clicked
into gear.
Prediction: 1-2
Hull City vs Sunderland
The Tigers have been solid at home all
season and Gus Poyet has yet to inject
the necessary belief in his players to
convince me they can add to their
solitary point so far.
Prediction: 1-0
Man City vs Norwich
Norwich had 31 shots against Cardiﬀ
and have the necessary guile to cause
Joe Hart real problems. However, Man
City are clearly home bankers and
rightly so – no team in the Premier
League possesses a more potent attack
INSIDE
Devils riding bikes in Hyde Park Duathlon
if things ever get hairy.
Prediction: 3-1
Stoke vs Southampton
Saints have a fantastic core of Lovren,
Fonte, Schneiderlin and Wanyama,
which allows them to play a pressing
game to great eﬀect, especially away.
The Potters showed uncharacteristic
ﬂair at Old Traﬀord but the Britannia
is no longer the fortress it once was.
Prediction: 0-1
West Brom vs Crystal Palace
Although Palace showed signs
of character and commitment
against Arsenal, they still look like
a Championship side. Luis Suarez
disposed of West Brom last time
out but the Baggies are a powerful,
attacking side and should have far too
much.
Prediction: 2-0
West Ham vs Aston Villa
West Ham have already lost 3 home
matches this season and are hard
to back with so few ﬁt strikers.
Villa perform better away and have
Christian Benteke to break down
the Hammers defence. They are due
a result too.kick-started Swansea’s
season.
Prediction: 1-0

Imperial Sail
Past Brighton
James Cox reports from Harlington
O
n a windy Wednesday
in west London,
Imperial 1st XV
hosted Brighton
at Harlington for
their third match of the season. Oﬀ
the back of a 24-0 win against their
inferior university colleagues, IC were
brimming with conﬁdence going into
this game with a very strong team on
paper, only missing centre Mike Floyd
(suﬀering from a bruised shoulder),
and albino winger Fred White (busy
scouting next year’s fresher intake
whilst modelling vests in Korea).
In the ﬁrst half Imperial were
playing against the elements, having
to stick to a very reserved and mature
game plan to prevent Brighton from
utilising the conditions. Brighton did
apply pressure, but were let down
by poor discipline which allowed IC
to work their way into the Brighton
half. Following a strong maul from
the forwards, led well by Irish skipper
Mickey O’Connell (from the Gaelic
‘Ó Conaill’ meaning “bravery of the
wolf”), Brighton gave away another
penalty allowing James Cox to put
the ﬁrst 3 points on the board with a
tough kick.
For the majority of the ﬁrst half
Imperial defended well, with big hits
and strong rucking from all members
of the team. As Imperial easily
absorbed the visitor’s pressure it was
Brighton who made the ﬁrst mistake.
Cox grabbed another 3 points from
the tee. The ﬁrst half ended at a strong
6-0, Imperial happy with their position
considering the conditions.
The second half kicked oﬀ with
IC keen to make use of the great
winds at Harlington, and that they
did. Halfbacks Fraser and Cox kept
Brighton pinned down, and strong
chases from both wingers (Freshers
John ‘the man’ Mann and Tom
‘catch me if you can’ Catchpole) gave
Brighton’sback3littlechancetoreturn
kicks. Following a blatant breach of
rucking rules, Imperial 1st XV was
awarded another penalty, which Cox
put between the uprights. Forced
onto the back foot, Brighton suﬀered
a constant barrage of strong runs from
both IC centres, Jack Flanagan and
Fresher Joe. It was Jack who was ﬁrst
to break through the back line, opting
to run through rather than round the
Brighton full back before slogging
his way over the line with half of the
Brighton team hanging on. Cox added
the extras.
Imperial continued to dominate as
both wingers came up just short of the
line, driven on by the loud cheers from
the cider fuelled 3rd XV, spectators
after a late cancellation to their ﬁxture.
The pack grafted all over the pitch,
Tom ‘little Lion Man’ Hedley and
Fresher ‘Vinegar Dave’ both making
large contributions to the tackle
count. The ferocious hits got the
better of the timid pier-dwellers, and
with shaking hands Brighton dropped
the egg, (Lesson 1: Don’t drop the
egg!). Cox seized the opportunity and
ran in for another 5 points. Normality
was ﬁnally restored as his conversion
went nowhere near the posts to keep
the score 21-0.
With the clock running out Imperial
gave a last push and ground their way
to within 10 metres of the Brighton
line. With pressure telling the referee
awarded a ﬁnal penalty in the last
play of the game which duly sailed
home to leave the score line at 24-0.
Congratulations to the 1st XV for a
mature and organised game and a
solid victory.
