rowds of rushing commuters,
dawdling tourists and giggling
schoolchildren. A sea of
colours, thoughts, noises. The
new ﬁlm adverts. The delays
announcements. The sound of a tube
pulling into the platform and your
desperate wish to get onto it.
This is what the TFL posters have
to compete with – and Tube150 is all
about how it’s achieved.
The exhibition is a collection of
London Underground posters- the
type they put up to tell you that an
upgrade is underway, or a new station
is opening. Moving through the rooms
of the exhibition is a journey through
the tube’s history, an education in
graphic arts and a recap of London’s
main events from the last century. The
oldest poster is from 1866, the ﬁrst year
of the District line, and compares the
cheap fares of the line in comparison to
the rival line, the Metropolitan.
The core of the exhibition is in the
fantastic art deco posters of the 30s,
years in which the tube boom was
in full swing. The various competing
underground companies were uniﬁed
in the early 30s, and the underground
started commissioning hundreds of
posters from top artists advertising
various locations reachable by tube.
The vibrant colours and elegant
lettering hark back to an age in which
tube travel was intensely fashionable,
the real symbol of a busy, aﬄuent and
glamorous capital.
The 40s posters are slightly more
sedate and show the shift in British
culture that the Second World War
caused. Suddenly the focus is on
technological advances, with black and
white photo montages boasting the
new safety features and improvements
(1937 saw the ﬁrst pneumatic doors on
tubes). There is also new emphasis on
the equality of the tube- we no longer
see fur-coated ﬂappers and top hatted
dandies, but factory workers sitting
next to business men. First class tickets
had been abolished in 1939, and TFL
shows how anyone can now pay the
cheap ticket to get about with comfort,
speed and reliability.
One poster, from 1944, shows the
cityscape and a tube station with a
patriotic paragraph underneath – so
far, nothing remarkable. The same
poster however was printed in diﬀerent
languages and put up across the globe
where British troops were stationed, to
encourage them on, and remind them
of their “Proud City”
.
After the 50s, tube posters went
through a bit of a boring phase, with
poster commissions being given to
C
herry blossom, silhouettes,
golden fans and blood.
Betrayal, loneliness,
dishonour and regret.
A young geisha, a crass
American Navy Lieutenant and their
young son. Puccini’s Madam Butterﬂy
is set against the late 19th century
obsession with Japan, an elusive
world of decadent elegance, where
beautiful 15 year olds can be bought
with the same ease and propriety as
villas with sea views.
The opera starts with Lieutenant
Pinkerton at his new villa on
Nagasaki, preparing to receive Cio
Cio San, the rashamen he has chosen.
Rashamen were women that could
be married on a monthly renewable
contract by Westerners docked at
Nagasaki or Yokohoma, and their
role in Japanese port life was that of
sanctioned sex-worker.
Here the story diverges from
historical facts, as an opera where
a naval oﬃcer takes a prostitute for
a few months would not be up to
much. The stuﬀ of opera is emotions
and feelings, and sure enough it
turns out that young Cio Cio San
is unaccountably besotted with
Pinkerton, and sees her marriage as
the end of her geisha work and the
start of a new American life with him.
It was at this point in the opera that
my ﬁrst surprise came. Cio Cio San
(meaning Madam Butterﬂy) is usually
shown like most tragic heroines –
vulnerable but alluring. In this ENO
production she is far from a femme
fatale – shy, cringing, scuttling about,
she desires Pinkerton but is too shy
and in awe of him to allow herself to
be touched.
Though this sits oddly with her
geisha past, it makes her a very real
character, as she persuasively displays
all the awkwardness of a young
teenager. Pinkerton on the other hand
was overly unpleasant, and because of
this never actually emerges as a truly
relatable character. He’s shallow, he
can’t wait to get back to America and
marry a “proper woman”, and all he
wants is a bit of fun whilst he remains
stationed in Japan. By the time the
ﬁrst act ﬁnishes it is clear that Cio
Cio is a deluded, sheltered young girl
who sees laddish Pinkerton as a hero
coming to save her from her life as a
sex-worker.
What makes this production
so special is its aesthetic quality
– the visual richness it maintains
throughout is a modern look at
1900s Japanophilia: rich reds and
golds, elegant silhouettes behind
paper screens and a huge metallic
ceiling and ﬂoor, mirroring the
opulent costumes. Throughout the
production, the stage is also ﬁlled
with black veiled ﬁgures, who move
the props around the stage, visible
but strangely unseen. Because of their
veiled faces and identical clothes,
they blend into the background –
they appear not as people but almost
as spirits.
In the second act, as Cio Cio is
waiting for Pinkerton’s return, they
foreshadow her tragic death using
coloured veils and puppets, spiralling
around her as she dozes. They are also
the puppeteers of her child (the only
character to be played by a puppet
and not a person), reminiscent of the
traditional Japanese puppet theatre
Bunraku. This is very diﬀerent to
European Punch and Judy type
puppets – the puppets are stylised
but life-sized, and are moved by
three puppeteers, making for an
unsettlingly human-like movement.
In the ﬁnal act, when Cio Cio takes
her own life, two of these black
ﬁgures come out and unfold her
wedding belt, which stretches out
into two long red veils, leaving her in
a dramatic river of blood.
They are disquieting, unusual,
and intensely oriental, capturing
the essence of this production – the
puzzled, coarse Western love for the
East.
advertising companies rather than
artists. A few notable exceptions are a
psychedelic 60s and a raving 80s poster,
advertising London nightlife.
The collection is wonderful. Vibrant,
interesting, funny, it really sums up
150 years of history seen through
the perspective of the most iconic
transport system in the world. It is
therefore a mystery to me why the
London Transport museum has
crowded it all into two thin rooms,
with tiny little plaster board corridors
blocking oﬀ one area from the other.
The whole point of the exhibition is
how versatile, captivating and striking
these artworks are – they needed to
be displayed a huge space, not a few
white-washed broom cupboards.
Despite the limited exhibition space,
Tube150 is a must for any user of public
transport in London, and will make
you step in to the tube home with a
whole diﬀerent world in mind. The
unequalled perk of a poster exhibition
is also that you can buy a reprint of your
favourite on your way out – deﬁnitely
better than the start of term poster sale!
