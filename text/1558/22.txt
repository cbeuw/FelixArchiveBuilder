eaf Havana’s early
single Friends Like
These ends with the
repeated line “Nothing
gets worse than grow-
ing old”. This show made me realise
they’re not wrong (maybe grammati-
cally, but, you know…). Surround-
ed by teenagers having the time of
their young lives, I came to the star-
tling realisation that I am no longer
young. There were people jumping
up and down, there were people sing-
ing along to every word, there were
young couples spooning like their
lives depended on it. Then there was
me, stood at the back, tapping my
foot along nonchalantly, and drink-
ing a pint of cheap lager like my life
depended on it.
Deaf Havana themselves were
pretty good. They played their ang-
sty brand of trying-to-be-heavy pop
punk (now you may understand the
demographic of the gig better…)
very well. The older hits, particularly
Leeches and I’m a Bore, mostly had
me bobbing my head and smiling,
and a cover of Friday, I’m in Love (by
The Cure) had me singing along with
the best of them (in hindsight, this
probably made me look older than
anything else). The tracks oﬀ the new
album were generally fairly uninspir-
ing. There seemed to be a prevalence
of the slower, more cringeworthy
type of pop punk which left me, well,
cringing, but the mass sing-alongs
made it seem like I was alone on that.
I do have a few criticisms of the band
that aren’t founded mostly in bitter-
ness. Firstly, I don’t understand why
there are 7 of them live. It just sounds
cluttered. Secondly, they should play
their breakthrough hit Friends Like
These, or at least one track from their
more hardcore oriented beginnings.
Thirdly, a long speech about how you
never thought you’d make it and you
love everybody there for supporting
you is clichéd and just painful to lis-
ten to (OK, maybe I’m drifting back
to bitterness now).
To be honest, there wasn’t that
much wrong with Deaf Havana. I am
the problem. Everyone seemed really
excited as they left the building, so it
must have been top notch. However,
in future, I should just leave the kids
to it. I did have the last laugh though,
as (probably) the only person who
brought a book, I at least absolutely
bossed the tube ride home.

Emielʼs Guide to Classical Music
Welcome to the ﬁrst real
instalment of my guide to Classical
Music! I hope to start introducing
the great composers and some of the
masterpieces which address the issues
raised in my column last week, but
I feel it’s necessary to describe the
historical and theoretical context from
which “classical music” arose ﬁrst. To
this end I will start at the beginning,
or rather, in the middle; for music
existed long before the “beginning”
and continued its course unperturbed
for a long time afterwards. The
moment I am referring to is of course
the birth of the literate tradition in
music; the earliest point from which
we have written music which is still
performable today, and the start of a
rich tradition.
In the 7th Century, St. Isidore
of Seville wrote that “unless sounds
are held in the memory of man they
perish, because they cannot be
written down”. Theorists such as
Boethius or St. Augustine who wrote
many centuries earlier still had the
most influential ideas about music.
To them, music or Musica was a Neo-
Platonist idea, which was not actually
attainable to musicians but which
only philosophers could discuss.
Musica was abstract; a perfect
measurement and division of time
(rhythm) and harmony (pitches).
Nevertheless – music
was of course being
performed and by musicians
too. From the 9th century
a portion of this music
began to be written as an
aid to the memory. As the
Carolingian monks spread
the liturgical Gregorian
chant through the newly
catholic Frankish empire
they began to make marks
above the text to designate
various musical ‘shapes’.
These were called neumes,
and initially very little was
thought of them (there isn’t
a single contemporaneous
literary reference!) – Music
remained oral and stored in
the memory, but eventually
they would grow into the
sophisticated notation system that
revolutionised the musical art.
Depictions of instruments and
ensembles tell us that music played a
big role in many aspects medieval life,
but unfortunately very little is known
about what was actually played. One
exception is the Gregorian chant
which make up the largest chunk
of written music surviving from the
Album Review: Deaf Havana
by Emiel de Lange
Episode 2: In the beginning...
1st millennia. This is a tradition of
plainchant that became the official
music sung for catholic ceremonies.
Plainchant basically consists of a
male choir singing a monophonic
line (that is, a line in unison) without
accompaniment. Different styles
existed depending on the type of
service and historical evidence
indicates that the chants were
performed differently throughout
time, but none of this was recorded.
Have a listen to some examples on the
Felix website!
By the 11th Century, Guido
of Arezzo had invented a system
of staffs which allowed precise
information about the relation
between pitches to be conveyed and
the revolution could truly begin. The
Gregorian chants were now written
and collected into books and a system
became necessary to organise and
classify the hundreds of specimens.
To develop this system theorists
once again looked back to Ancient
Greece, and speciﬁcally the ideas of
Pythagoras.
Legend has it that the philosopher
heard the harmonious sound of anvils
being struck and discovered that
the most consonant harmonies
(notes sounding pleasant or stable
together) consisted of simple ratios
in the size of the instrument. Today
we deﬁne a note by a standard
frequency, for example middle ‘A’
is usually 440 Hz, while another ‘A’
will have a frequency in a 2:1 ratio
with 440. The next simplest ratio
is 3:2 which gives a “perfect ﬁfth”,
i.e. ‘A’ to ‘E’, and so on. In order
to classify the chants, theorists
would take the ﬁnal note and
observe what pattern of intervals
(the difference between pitches)
occurred between it and its ﬁfth.
From this they developed a system
of scales called modes from which
our current system of major and
minor keys is derived – but we will
get to that later!
This retheorisation had a
massive effect on the writing of
music. Composers could and began
to use the modes to create “tonally
articulated formal structures” –
the ﬁrst being Hucbald of St.
Amand. That is; pieces of music
structured around the use of
different modes to give contrast
and ﬁnally resolution. Our modern
idea of a ‘piece’ of music was
beginning to emerge: an aesthetic
unit. Before this, music was not
seen as something autonomous
which existed in its own right,
but rather as an activity in which
one participated and which had
speciﬁc social and religious utility.
So the literate revolution
in music is now well and truly
underway! Notation has already
catalysed deep changes in the way
music was conceived and used
and soon the ﬁrst great musical
artists came about. In 2 weeks
we will explore the works of
arguably the greatest of these early
composers, the Abbess Hildegard
von Bingen, but until then please

you can explore a selection of real
musical examples.
