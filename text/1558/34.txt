FRIDAY 01 NOV
TECHNOLOGY
Steve Wozniak at Apps-World 2013

S
teve Wozniak, known
by many as Woz was
the keynote speaker of
Apps-World 2013 at Earls
Court, London. As a
member of the press via my website,
I was invited and given a press pass.
The whole day was a very surreal
experience, basically being treated like
a member of royalty as each exhibitor
tries to get your attention. For the
keynote I got to use the special press
area! (The front row in other words!)
Being sandwiched between reporters
from The Guardian and TechRadar
was an interesting experience to say
the least!
Steve Wozniak was deﬁnitely
trying to encourage us to be better
at creating successful technology
startups. With the rise of kickstarter
this was deﬁnitely portrayed to
us as the best time in years to
start your own business venture.
“The bigger a company is the slower
it changes, people who buy apple
products want Apple like products.
Any product which doesn’t ﬁt into
the Apple ideals is not the Apple
way, you know whether its apple
or not. This goes back to the day
when Steve [Jobs] introduced the
Macintosh. In the 1984 commercial
we were the new guys, [now that we
are established] you can’t take Apple
in totally new directions. This gives
smaller companies an advantage in
ﬁnding the smaller areas of the market
or come up with radical new ideas.”
He then went to explain how apple
developed quickly. “Marketing is the
most important thing [in establishing
a new business]” Woz then explained
to us how it was easy to grow at ﬁrst
because the media like reporting on a
business with a great idea who started
from their garage. When Apple
became a larger company the media
got bored and left us, at this point it
was hard to make an impact and only
due to some great commercials like
the 1984 they would have gone under.
“At HP they turned down my
ideas [for a PC] 5 times.” To be a
great business leader you need to
recognise a good idea when you see
one. ”At HP we were only building
tools that engineer’s use. We, the
engineers were the experts.” As such
the engineers came up with ideas
which were largely ignored by HP.
“Then Steve and I started Apple, we
weregoingtobeverymarketorientated
very subject to the end user even
when you are running on zero dollars.”
This enabled us to create completely
new product targeted towards
consumers rather than businesses.
He then continued on to explain
how important he thinks engineers
are in turning a good idea into
reality, and even improving it. “If
you are businessman please ﬁnd the
engineers. Engineering is so diﬃcult
and they think of things to improve
your own product idea. Give it time
to gel.” Engineers think of new ideas,
“Oddball ideas that don’t pop into
other people heads will come to
you.” In producing and designing the
product; “Excellence is absolutely
important. I’ll improve the graphics
etc. give it a second try make it better.”
Even though he had just lectured
us for quite a while on building
a good business he claims; “I am
not a businessman, I’ve certainly
had start-ups on my own, and I
invest when I like the idea in terms
of an engineer not whether it
could or could not be proﬁtable”
If all else fails you can always
print your own cash. Steve started
doing this with a friend, and
somehow it is perfectly legal to
use it in a shop, I can’t see how,
and he didn’t properly explain it.
“I nearly got arrested once and
read my rights, but I got out of it” “I
sometimes sell a sheet of 14 dollars
for 8 dollars to random people in
the street”. Apparently they are
“Secret Service approved bills.”
Besides focussing on business we
learnt a few thing about Steve, the
most surprising of which is that he
openly criticised the new iPad Air as
not suiting his needs. “ I called my wife
and told her I wasn’t getting a new one,
I was disappointed with the 128GB
maximum storage” Furthermore
he told us that “the iPhone could do
with a much larger screen, probably
around ﬁve inches.” Furthermore to
that he said that Apple had taken
the “wrong direction by changing
the aspect ratio of the iPhone,” this
was followed by a large cheer from
the crowd made up of nearly entirely
developers who must have agreed!
He then proceeded to tell us that he
doesn’t have home broadband, and
only has a T1 line (1mbit/s). It takes
hours to download a movie, and by
the time I’ve downloaded it I don’t
want it anymore.” In fact we learnt that
only movie worth downloading and
“watching about Apple is Pirates of
Silicon Valley, although they didn’t get
everything right, I really enjoyed it!”
Steve’s currently spending most
of his time on various projects such
as FusionIO and other start-ups and
visiting places around the world.
Apple’s New Keynote and What it Means for You
Maximilian Eggl
Technology Editor
A
s mentioned in last
weeks news bubble
Apple had a key note
last tuesday. That
day conﬁrmed most
rumours on the internet as well as
some pleasant surprises. However
if you are looking at the news,
scratching your head and wondering
how this will aﬀect anything in your
life, read on dear reader and all shall
be explained!
Let’s ﬁrst talk about the new
iPads. These two updates to existing
products had been predicted several
weeks ago, so no big surprises their.
Furthermore rather than these devices
being revolutionary, they are more
evolutionary than anything, but I bet
you heard that clichéd phrase before.
However more so than recent years,
these iterations actually did get some
serious upgrades. Before we start
anything though, let’s just clear up
that the new name for the big iPad
is the iPad Air, which considering its
new weight and thickness is actually
quite a good name. It seems this is an
attempt by Apple to create more of
a link between their macbook range
and their tablets (maybe we might
even see a combo device some day!). A
complete redesign for the bigger iPad
has seen it lose half a pound as well as
24% of its overall volume. At this point
it really just seems to fall in line with
the minimalist design that Ive so loves.
The mini also got an upgrade by
receiving that retina display, that
should have been included in the ﬁrst
Mini. However with 4 times the pixels,
this display should be a real beautiful
to look at and fall in line with the high
standard that all other apple products
follow.
The inclusion of the 64-bit A7 in
both the Air and the Mini will lead to
some serious speed increases, which
should make that graphic design/
music production/gaming that much
more smooth.
Now the big question, should you
splash out? Well that really depends, if
you are in the market for a new tablet
and are willing to pay the premium
(£399 for cheapest iPad Air, £319 for
new iPad Mini), I would seriously
suggest going for either the Mini or
the Air. If you have just gotten the
last iPad it may be more prudent to
wait, as the high price does not really
warrant what you are getting in terms
of new stuﬀ.
The other big thing of this keynote
was Mavericks. While everything
new in mavericks has been discussed
in a prior article, the pricing was
not. Therefore one of the pleasant
surprises of the keynote was the
fact that Mavericks (Apple’s newest
update of its operating system)
would now be free. Previously these
things usually cost about £20, which
comparing to the price of windows is
a steal. However if you consider how
much Apple really makes from their
OS, they may as well make it free. Its
a great way to lure in new customers,
and hopefully all new updates will be
free. Therefore if you have an eligible
Mac, you may as well update as you
will get some nice new features (love
that extended battery life)! However
one little caveat. I found that my Mac
slowed down a bit after the update,
so for all you out there with older
devices, I would suggest to you to
maybe wait a month or so, until all the
last bugs are worked out and the OS is
fully optimized!
The last little thing I want to mention
is the price of Apple’s equivalent of
Oﬃce. It is now also free of charge.
Yes, dear reader you read correctly,
it costs diddly squat. If you consider
how much money Apple really makes,
the amount they make from their
software is like a drop in the ocean.
Therefore this strategy of oﬀering
pages, keynote and numbers for free is
quite a smart strategy. However, and
here comes the disadvantage, is that
this price only applies to new devices!
How devious of Apple!
