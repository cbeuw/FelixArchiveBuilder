Saudi Arabia: Is driving a human right?
I
’ve always been in love with
driving. In school, when I was
learning to drive, my Physics
teacher told me that he wished
that we were in Saudi Arabia,
where women are banned from
driving, because then at least I’d shut
up about it in his lessons. I remember
being outraged to learn this, and it’s
always stuck with me. While I would
abstain from describing driving as a
basic human right, it’s certainly not a
right that should be awarded based on
gender.
According to the 2013 Global
Gender Gap Report, Saudi Arabia
comes in at 127th out of 136 countries
in terms of gender equality. Despite
minor ﬂuctuations, their score has
improved more than any other Middle
Eastern and North African region
since 2006. However, it remains the
lowest performing in the group of
high-income countries. Education
for women has improved drastically
over the last few decades, with rates
of women enrolling in post-secondary
education now being higher for
women than for men. A quota for
the number of women in parliament
has been introduced, meaning that
it is now made up of 20% women. In
2011, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz
al Saud declared that women would
be eligible to stand and vote in the
2015 local elections, and as of August,
domestic violence is now a criminal
oﬀence. However, despite all these
improvements, the gender gap index
score remains far lower than other
countries of similar GDP, global
competitiveness index, or many other
comparable factors. While progress is
being made rapidly in Saudi Arabia,
there is still a long way to go.
In opposition to these changes,
Saudi Arabia remains the only country
in the world to place a ban on women
driving. This is seen largely as a result
of the culture, not any religious laws,
and indeed, neither national traﬃc
regulations nor sharia law explicitly
prevent women from driving. Instead,
women cannot obtain licences, and
police are advised to remove keys
from any women drivers, and issue
them with a warning.
Sheikh Saleh bin Saad al-Lohaidan,
a conservative cleric and judicial
advisor, has recently gone on record
as saying that women who drive are
more likely to bear children with
clinical problems as the act of driving
“automatically aﬀects the ovaries and
pushes the pelvis upwards”, which
sounds like something that The Onion
would report. The 2013 March of
Dimes global report on birth defects
shows Saudi Arabia coming in second
highest out of all countries listed,
with 81.3 birth defects per 1000 live
births. With many birth defects being
attributed to environmental factors
and inadequate prenatal care, this
seems to suggest that banning women
from driving should not really be their
biggest concern when it comes to
reducing this.
On October 26th, many women
took to their cars, and posted videos
online of themselves driving in
various cities. In contrast to similar
protests in 1990 and 2011, there have
been no reported arrests following
these demonstrations. According to
activists leading the campaign, the
attitude of Saudi men towards women
driving is changing, seeing the ban
as no longer in line with a country
where 17% of the native workforce are
women. The lack of enforcement of
the ban throughout these protests also
seems to indicate a changing mood
amongst the government in terms of
lifting the ban. King Abdullah has said
publicly that women will drive one
day, but Saudi authorities are quoted
as saying that “society is not ready”, a
view seemingly deﬁed by the social
media response and the vast number
of signatories on the petitions to allow
women to drive.
Attitudes towards gender equality
are changing in Saudi Arabia, and
with global support, it can only get
better. There is still an awful lot of
improvement yet to be made, but it is
happening, and quickly. The success
of these protests would be a huge
leap in terms of women’s freedoms in
Saudi Arabia. Although it may not be
the biggest discrimination that they
currently face, it has been described
I
f there is one thing the our
Union has got right is its ability
to generate endless of amounts
bureaucracy and suﬀer a
constant stream of changing
individuals ﬁlling roles without much
of an idea of what they’re supposed
to be doing or even being qualiﬁed to
complete their role.
Anyone who has experienced the
hours of endless joy that is Union
Council is well aware that things can
be a right shambles. Our current
constitution was replaced last year
with little consultation using a
template that was designed by the
NUS despite our own Union having a
rather more completed legal standing
as deﬁned in the Imperial College
Charter (the Union may or may not be
a separate legal entity).
In fact the sweeping changes
brought in by the new constitution
are so radical that the body charged
with advising on the impact of
constitutional changes, the Union
Court (which was abolished as part
of the changes) provided a report
detailing some of the issues with the
proposed constitution which was
longer the constitution itself.
Anyone at this week’s Council
meeting would have seen a lengthy
debate about the Government’s
Immigration Bill which culminated
with the ﬁnal decision being that we
couldn’t make a decision at the time
despite numerous good proposals
that addressed peoples points being
proposed, while aware that prompt
action was needed if the Union wished
to actually accomplish anything
regarding the bill.
If there is one thing that does help
keep the Union running from day to
day it is the team of approximately 50
employed professionals that actually
oversee the running of the Union
behind the scenes. These people
actually have a vested interest in
seeing the Union be successful. Some
individuals who are familiar with how
the Union operates often refer to the
Sabbatical oﬃcers as puppets.
Despite the issues with the new
constitution, changes were needed.
Talking about the old arrangements
of the Union’s government the Chair
of the Trustee Board, Dame Julia
Higgins, said that the Union’s “systems
were ﬂawed and failing in governance”
(Union Council Minutes 30 October
2012).
Aside for the issue of a constant
changing team of individuals
with oversight of the Union and
its activities, the fact that these
individuals are selected by a popularity
contest means that it is often not the
best individual that gets the post. Yes,
we run a College wide ballot and, yes,
we have some the best turnout for
the “Big Elections” but if you actually
look at voter turnout for most of
the other roles in the Union e.g. the
members of Union Council (the board
responsible for keeping oversight
of the Sabbs and Trustees as well as
being ‘the representative body’ of the
Union) the turnout is depressingly
low and the result is dramatically
eﬀected by the popularity of the
individual running. So when you then
think about who actually runs for the
posts of Sabbatical oﬃcers its almost
always the people who have been
involved the Union and hence got in
though being popular. The number
of times I’ve heard people complain
that “actually none of the candidates
for this Sabb role are any good” is far
to high to be consistent with the idea
of the elections being the best way of
appointing people for the posts and
system of governance working for us
– how many of you have complained
about, or tried to do something with
a club society or project simply to get
tied up in endless amounts procedural
matters?
So what’s my solution? Well simply
to have become to Saudi women what
the seat on the bus was to Rosa Parks –
a symbol of a more subtle oppression.
Jonathan Peek on the warpath
what we need is for people who
would actually make good oﬃcers
to take an interest in the Union, and
we (as a voting body) need to vote
for the person who would actually
be best rather than who we know
– unfortunately this requires less
voter apathy and actually an election
process that prompts informed voting.
The good news is that we do have
at least one basic test as part of the
election process: if you haven’t written
a manifesto or uploaded a photo then
good luck trying to beat RON.
