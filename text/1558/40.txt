FRIDAY 01 NOV
CAREERS
I
write this short article on the
day of the worst storm to batter
Southern England since the last
great storm way back in 1987.
Today the Careers Service has
had to adapt as staﬀ were delayed
on their way into work, hampered
by the travel chaos that ensued. It
got me thinking about all the key
employability skills that have had
to be used today to remain up and
running and providing a service to you
guys. Problems have been reviewed,
solutions put in place, changes
communicated to students and team
members briefed. All this from just
the ﬁrst hour at Imperial this morning!
All these key transferable skills came
into play during one short period on
a Monday morning, just think what
core skills you can develop over the
course of your studies and use to
great eﬀect in your future applications
for employment or internships and
placements!
As you settle back into the College
academic year you are no doubt
becoming aware of the myriad of
events that the Careers Service
arranges to help you come to a career
decision and to set you on the pathway
for a rewarding and fulﬁlling career.
No matter what route you choose to
pursue after completing your studies,
whether to remain in academia or
to go into the world of work, either
through an internship or by entering
a graduate training programme- you
will undoubtedly have to go through
some form of selection process.
For many this can seem daunting
but the key to success is giving
evidence of what you can oﬀer and
importantly how you have been
gaining valuable transferable skills
during your studies. Employers are
looking for a well-rounded future
colleague. They can see you have the
academic qualiﬁcations, but how can
you show them you have all the skills
and behaviours that they are looking
for? Often when I speak to students
they do not fully appreciate what
they have to oﬀer and overlook key
skills they have developed or will have
obtained by the time they graduate.
So, what do we mean by transferable
skills? Transferable skills are a key set
of attributes that employers require
from you. As you review opportunities
either on line via Jobslive (http://
www3.imperial.ac.uk/careers) or
from company websites, you will
see job descriptions and person
speciﬁcations for diﬀerent roles. Time
spent reading and understanding
the requirements for any role is time
well spent. Obviously you will need
to pay attention to the academic
requirements for the role, but what of
the other aspects that you will most
likely see.
Are they asking for communication
skills, time management skills, team
working skills, problem solving skills,
a positive ‘can do’ attitude, and so
on? Any application, whether for
a Graduate level role, internship
or higher level study will require
you to fully assess what you have to
oﬀer. To succeed our job is not to
discount areas that you have solid
experience in or undersell yourself.
Those reading your applications will
want good evidence of your skills.
It is not enough for example to say,
“I’m a good communicator”, you
need to say where and how you have
developed these skills. For example
this could come from group projects
you are undertaking as part of your
course. How many people are in the
group? Are you aware of cultural
diﬀerences? Do you listen to others
and propose solutions? Do you
actively involve others in the group
and so on. Already, by expanding on
one aspect, communication, your
response to application questions or
laid out on your CV really comes to
life. This enables the reader to start
to gain a more detailed picture of you
and how you might be able to use
the communications skills you have
developed.
You will have lots of opportunity to
gain these key transferable skills while
at Imperial. These can come from
work and experiences you are gaining
throughout your studies or from your
extracurricular activities from clubs
and societies.
So, where might you start to look for
evidence of your transferable skills?
The table is just a starting point but
by thinking these areas through you
will start to identify more as you really
think about what you have to oﬀer.
If you are unsure how to interpret
your skills in the best possible way
don’t forget you can get help from the
Careers Service by booking to see one
of our Careers Consultants.
