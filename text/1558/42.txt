PISCES
This week you are messing
around in BioEng and you
accidentally turn all your
lecturers into giant hamsters.
Sadly, you can’t speak hamster,
so you fail all your exams. All
your friends can and get firsts.
Pint?
This week you buy a load
of straw and build a nest
in the library. You become
‘Mr Nibbles’, the library pet
and live on a diet of leftover
library muffins and jacket
potatoes. You are removed
by security for sipping from
an abandoned coffee in the
corner.
This week you buy a pet
hamster to keep you
company. A few days later
you are distressed to find it
has escaped, eaten all your
lecture notes and run away.
It also stole your laptop
and sold it on eBay. Damn
hamster...
This squeak, a small family of
hamsters has nested in your
ear. *squeak!* They burrow into
your brain, blurring your words
and can barely squeak. You
try to write an SOS message
but *squeak* in the *squeak*
desperation *squeak* wait!
*squeak* and the pain
*squeak!* until *squeak!*
*SQUEAK!*
This week you buy a new pair
of socks only to find that they
are live hamsters. You are
unable to control where they
take you and so spend the rest
of the week in a hamster strip
club. You enjoy yourself and
waste your entire student loan.
This week you finish breeding
your army of hamsters,
ready to attack the Wolfson
computing suite so that you
can get a computer for once.
Your hamstery minions turn on
you and eat all your fingers.
HOW WILL YOU TYPE NOW?
You fail all your exams.
This week, you are shocked
and surprised when you
suddenly give birth to a litter
of hamsters. This confuses
you for two reasons: First, they
are hamsters. Second, you
thought you were still a virgin.
Wow... you and your friend
must have had a rough night at
fivesixeight.
This week you go to fivesixeight
only to find that the barman
is a giant hamster. You know
someone that went to a hamster
strip club, so you and your friend
hit on the barman. He takes you
both to his nest and you spend a
beautiful night together.
This week you are the only
person who can defeat the
hamster horde in the Wolfson
computing suite. You throw a
book directly into the hamster
mothership, killing them all.
You become known as the
hamster killer and everyone
hates you.
This week you tell your lecturer
that he looks like a giant
hamster. He thanks you for the
compliment and you suddenly
start getting full marks in your
problem sheets. You are top
in the year; nobody else can
get full marks as the lecturer
always nibbles on the printed
notes.
This week you order curly
fries from fivesixeight, only
to be served a plate of straw
instead. You wonder if this has
anything to do with the new
hamster barman, but then you
remember that the curly fries
were always like this.
This week, you must choose
between having a living
beard of hamsters and having
hamsters for hands. On the
one hand a beard of hamsters
would be sooo fashionable, but
they may gnaw on your face a
bit, whilst hamster-hands may
aidyouramateurpuppetcareer
but would add a challenging
aspect to masturbation.

“NSA Spying Network
Not Extensive Enough”
F
urther reassurance was
provided this week that
money and fame were far
more important to the ruling
of law than either the nature
of law or any sense of justice when
Newcastle United footballer, Cheick
Tioté, was let oﬀ possessing and using
a fake drivers’ license.
The ruling that Tioté would be given
a suspended prison sentence instead
of an actual one eased many people’s
fears that the law would begin to show
favour to those without much money
or of whom no one had ever heard of.
In the City, the sigh of relief was au-
dible as the many wankers responsible
for ﬁddling the economy and inﬂicting
5 years of recession felt reassured they
would never be found oﬃcially guilty.
President Orders Review Into
Security Agencyʼs Laziness
S
aying he was unhappy with
the “insuﬃcient” range
of spying by the National
Security Agency, President
Obama has today ordered a
review into the extent of its inﬁltration.
“Are Snowden’s ﬁgures right?” the
President said in a statement, adding,
“Were we really only spying on 35
world leaders?”
Commenting on the fact that this
left 160 heads of states completely
unaﬀected the President added that
“How are we supposed to get a feel for
their exact opinions and thoughts?”
“Also, how come we were only
tapping 60 million phone calls in
Spain?” “There must have been over a
billion calls there in the last year alone.
How am I supposed to gauge the exact
mood of the Spanish public regarding
the intimate details of Obamacare?”
Edward Snowden, the man who
brought the pathetic extent of the US
spying network to light stated “I’m just
glad I could bring these deﬁciencies to
the fore. I love my country. God Bless
America”
At press time, it was reported
that Vice-President Joe Biden was
attempting to make up for the
inadequacies of the NSA by dressing
incognito and following the Mongolian
Premier around.

the lack of scale
and ambition in
the USAʼs spying
networks.
