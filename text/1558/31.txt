Television is dead, long live the internet
With Orange is the New Black, Netﬂix shows TV execs how itʼs done

N
etﬂix are branching
out. No longer content
with being the mother
of all procrastination
techniques (in the
battle of lab report against the entire
series of Gossip Girl, there can only
be one winner) and bringing in the
internet streaming revolution, the
American website has started showing
original content available exclusively
on Netﬂix. The ﬁrst test subject in
this experiment was political drama
House of Cards, which proved an
uncontested success when it went
on to be nominated for nine Emmys,
including Outstanding Drama series.
Following this, when the cult US
comedy Arrested Development was
cancelled by Fox, Netﬂix bought
the rights and revived it for a fourth
series, to the great delight of fans
everywhere.
No wonder, then, that Netﬂix saw
ﬁt to continue this winning streak
by commissioning more original
content to show. Orange is the New
Black is the latest of these and is, so
far, the most successful yet. This may
come as surprising, as it’s the type of
‘risky’ show which is probably unlikely
to be picked up by one of the major
American networks, given that it’s an
adult drama with an almost entirely
female cast, set inside a women’s
prison.
The show follows the adventures
of Piper Chapman, a white, well-
educated, middle-class woman, as
the newest inmate in a New York
federal prison. During a couple of
‘experimental’ years after graduating
from college, Chapman decides to
travel Europe with her lesbian, drug-
dealing lover, who asks her to smuggle
$50,000 of drug money into Belgium.
The consequences of the crime don’t
catch up with her until ten years down
the line, when Chapman, now settled
down with an Adam-Sandler-lookalike
ﬁancé and making artisanal bath
products for a living, is sentenced to
ﬁfteen months in prison. Interestingly,
the series is based oﬀ a true story: the
source material for Orange is the New
Black is a memoir written by author
Piper Kerman, detailing her time in
prison after pleading guilty to money
laundering for her then-girlfriend.
Although trying to see the silver
lining in the jail sentence (“I’m going
to get ripped,” she announces to her
boyfriend before departing, “and read
everything on my Amazon wishlist,
and maybe even learn a craft, you
know?”) Chapman is about as ill-
prepared for prison as anyone is likely
to be. From the strip search upon entry
to the repulsively seedy male prison
guards, this is a world completely
unfamiliar to that which she has come
from. The parallels between the two
worlds are highlighted in ﬂashbacks
to Chapman’s pre-prison life; after
accidentally insulting the inmate chef
and consequently being starved out
at every mealtime, she ﬂashes back
to the hunger she felt during a juice
cleanse detox programme. And as if
life in prison couldn’t be bad enough,
Chapman’s misery is compounded
when she discovers her ex-girlfriend,
the source of all her troubles, is
another new inmate.
The supporting cast of characters
are one of the best things about
the show. Each episode shows the
backstory of how a particular inmate
came to be there, an invariably tragic
story, whether it be aiding illegal
immigration, or stealing money to
pay for gender reassignment surgery.
The show also doesn’t gloss over
the brutalities of prison life, such as
racism or sexual assault. There’s plenty
of lighter moments, though - a leaving
party for one of the soon-to-be-ex-
prisoners, the hairdressing salon un by
inmates and the friendship between a
yoga instructor and a nun, to name a
few.
Orange is the New Black has one
of the most diverse casts you’re likely
to see on TV at the moment. The fact
that the show’s female characters
span a broad range of ethnicities,
sexualities, and socio-economic
classes shouldn’t be note-worthy,
but, compared to similar shows out
there with similar target audiences,
it is. Each character is written with
authenticity and respect, leading to
some thought-provoking questions
about the viewers own internal biases
and preconceptions.
Still wondering whether to give it a
go? If you want to see one of the best
representations of women currently
on TV, this show is for you. If you
want a sensitively-handled critique
of America’s War on Drugs, it’s for
you. Or, if you enjoyed Prison Break
but felt like it could have done with
more lesbians, then it’s deﬁnitely for
you. Either way, Netﬂix has put all of
the ﬁrst series up at the same time,
so you don’t even have to wait a week
between episodes; a second series is
already in the works as well. If Orange
is the New Black is at all indicative
of the quality of TV in the internet-
streaming, post-television world, long
live the revolution.
