COMMENT
Immigration
Bill discussed at
Union Council
A
pro-European Union
campaign group has
opened itself up to
potential charges of
breaches of charity
regulations by contacting Imperial
Union to ask for help in its campaign
“to stop UKIP becoming the biggest
party” in the 2014 European elections.
In an email to the Union President
and the Campaigns Oﬃcer dated
October 17, Joe Coney, the Campaign
Director at British Inﬂuence, wrote
that the group believed that “a
signiﬁcant UKIP win would be bad
news on issues such as gender and
LGBT equality and stopping climate
change”. Coney went on to oﬀer to
“host a campaign training session
[at Imperial] before Christmas” and
asked to discuss “any ways in which
the Student Union could help [British
Inﬂuence] get more students to vote in
the election”.
However, as a registered charity,
the Union is not legally allowed
to campaign on matters which are
deemed to be ultra vires – that is
matters which do not directly aﬀect
Imperial students. In his email, Coney
wrote that while British Inﬂuence
realised the “charity status means that
the SU can’t campaign,” the group
would like to oﬀer to campaign for the
Union and Imperial students on this
issue.
Replying to the email, Union
President David Goldsmith wrote
that while the proposal “is interesting,
it is crucial that Imperial College
Union, as a registered charity, remains
neutral on party political issues, and
although [British Inﬂuence is] not
a political party, supporting [the]
campaign would essentially mean
the Union taking a view against a
particular party”. He directed Coney
to the Union’s many political societies,
saying that they are “more able to
campaign on political issues if it falls
within their aims and objectives as a
society”.
While British Inﬂuence seemed
to be satisﬁed with this response, a
disgruntled senior Union oﬃcer, who
wishes to remain anonymous, has
conﬁrmed to Felix that they passed on
the text of the original email to Paul
Staines – a controversial right wing
blogger and columnist better known
by the pseudonym Guido Fawkes.
Stains subsequently wrote about the
issue in his regular column in the Sun
on Sunday, prompting widespread
criticism of British Inﬂuence on social
media. Steve Crowther, the UKIP
part chairman, has been reported as
having requested that the Charity
Commission investigate the incident.
British Inﬂuence has played down
allegations of impropriety, telling
Staines that “this was just a clumsily
worded email”. At the time of going to
print the Union had not released an
oﬃcial statement.

British Influence approaches the
Union to make a stance on UKIP
T
he second meeting of the
Union Council was held on
Tuesday, October 29. The
main issue of discussion
was the Union’s response
to the government’s Immigration
Bill 2013-2014. Proposed by Home
Secretary Theresa May on October
10 the Bill had its second reading on
October 22 and is expected to pass
through parliament and receive royal
assent early next spring. The Bill is
of potential concern to international
students since it would require them
to pay a minimum fee of £200 a year
to use non-emergency NHS services
and would place a legal obligation on
landlords to check the immigration
status of their tenents – potentially
biasing them against international
students.
In a paper for the Council, Union
President David Goldsmith wrote that
“international student fees contribute
a vast amount to supporting the UK
higher education system”, quoting
ﬁgures from the Department of
Business, Innovation and Skills that
state that, in 2012, “international
students contributed £7.9 billion to
the UK economy”. Goldsmith claimed
that the Bill was poorly researched –
citing the discrepancy between the
£200 million to £2 billion that the
government estimates is spent on
healthcare for international students
and the £33 million ﬁgure cited by
the NHS itself. He went on to add
that he believed that “the bill would
discourage international students
from applying to institutions such as
Imperial College, thereby reducing
funding” and called for the Council
to vote “to oppose the … proposals
set out in the immigration bill
by arranging meetings with local
representatives and campaigning with
the student body”.
While some members of the
Council expressed the opinion that
