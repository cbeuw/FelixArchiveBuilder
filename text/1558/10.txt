with ideas, and believe that great
ideas can be conceived by anyone at
any time. However, many great ideas
never get oﬀ the ground, for any of a
number of reasons. At Shell, we want
to make sure that promising ideas are
nurtured and supported. What better
place to start than at university? And
what better talent to support than
students? ”
How to enter
Once you have an idea, you can
enter as an individual or as part of a
team (max 3 people per team). You are
also required to have a member of the
university academic staﬀ to support
your application. Once you’ve signed

your idea take shape. Ideas need to be

After review by Shell, the top 100 ideas

on skills and industry knowledge.
From this you will be required to
write a detailed report followed by a
3-minute video presentation. Only 5
teams make it to the ﬁnal round and
this takes place in the Netherlands.
Entrepreneurship
An Imperial student has done it
before. Alex Schey studied mechanical
engineering at Imperial and went
up to set up Vantage power. Straight
after university, he acquired £700,000
sponsorship to build and design an
electric car, which he drove down
the Pan-American Highway, which
is over 26,000km. He them went on
to develop a revolutionary hybrid
drivetrain designed to retroﬁt existing
double-decker buses to reduce fuel
consumption by 40%.
If you feel like taking on this energy,
water and food challenge, submit your
idea today!
