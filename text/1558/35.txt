10 Things the Internet has Slaughtered
Osama Awara
Technology Editor
In no particular order, (to avoid nerd
rage) here goes:
Long gone are the days of popping in
to your local Blockbusters and buying
that VHS tape or DVD that had you
sorted for the night. With the boom
of wireless internet from your Ming
Dynasty era dial-up connection,
streaming movies/shows online has
never been quicker or easier. With
services such as Netﬂix or your more
illegal torrenting websites such as
‘The Piratebay’ getting that movie
you’ve been longing to watch is now
just a click away rather than ﬁve
blocks away.
Now I’m sure you’re aware that when
someone on the other side of the
world is communicating with you via
written text, it is diﬀerent from them
having a face to face conversation
with you whilst their body language
is in full swing. I’m pretty sure
everyone’s been in a situation where
they simply couldn’t detect if their
friend was being sarcastic or genuine.
It’s always with phrases such as KK
(ok cool) or that Facebook thumbs
up at the end of a conversation that
gets delivered to me after telling one
badass story that does my head in.
The internet has literally killed oﬀ
productivity. Obviously, you can
argue that the internet is full of useful
information that you can utilise for
your own learning beneﬁt, but the
reality of it is that you’ll always have
a billion other distractions to take
you oﬀ your pursuit of knowledge.
I crown YouTube and Facebook
as the king and queen of world-
wide procrastination. The strangely
beautiful thing about YouTube is that
you can go on it with the intention
of watching say a one 5 minute music
video but somehow end up on a
‘Kaka owns Xavi’ video.
Before the late 90’s or early 00’s if
you were ever seen taking a picture
of your meal before eating it, you’d
probably get sent to your nearest
lunatic asylum without the slightest
When the word ‘troll’ is typed/
spoken/read on the internet, it no
longer refers to the great big mythical
beast that used to terrorize villagers
in Scandinavia. Now, it means as
Urban Dictionary quite eloquently
puts it, someone who, ‘posts a
deliberately provocative message to
a newsgroup or message board with
the intention of causing maximum
disruption and argument.’
With the luxury of providing
anonymity from other public users
of the internet, the web has made
the asking of some seriously dumb
ass questions online a daily ritual. A
quick browse of Yahoo Answers says
it all really, with questions like, ‘My
hesitation from the local authorities.
Now, we cannot go a day without
seeing someone post online the meal
they are about to devour, as if a stash
of hash browns and bacon are the
most interesting things in the world.
Instragram has a lot to answer for.
Quite an obvious one to be honest.
With all the recent headlines
regarding the NSA and the US
conspiracy to spy on everyone’s
online activities, the internet’s been
a main factor facilitating our lack of
privacy. Haven’t you noticed by now
every time you go on a websites,
cookies are tracking your activities
online and tailoring the content you
receive? Now at ﬁrst this may just
seem harmless, a cookie is just a text
ﬁle at the end of the day, but trust me
you can tell a lot about a person just
by looking at their online activity.
This should probably be under
’10 search engines Google has
slaughtered,’ but for me Google is the
internet and the internet is Google.
Wikipedia pretty much sums this all
up.

girlfriend got pregnant and we didn’t
have sex,’ propping up daily on the
homepage.
A quick look at any one of the many
YouTube videos’ comment section
would be enough to prove this. No
longer can people argue with each
other in a pleasant fashion. I guess
being able to hide under a user name,
without anyone seeing or knowing
you’re the person typing the torrent
of insults, lets you get away with
pretty much anything really .
Oh Yahoo users, you never cease to amaze me.
