The case for
better driving
Daren Austin takes
a brief look at
advanced driving:
tests and the
likelihood of having|
an accident.
'13 dead on M62', '18 dead on M6\
'U-turn madness on M4'. Fortunately
headlines like this are not everyday
reading in our national papers, but
accidents do happen every day on our
road and motorway network.
Accidents with rare exceptions do
not occur at any given time or place,
but rather in widely scattered areas,
at all times of day and night.
Surprisingly only a few of these can
be attributed to any particular road
feature or vehicle defect, but it is
found that 90% of all accidents can
be traced to 'human error' by the
person or persons concerned.
By international standards Britain's
roads are relatively safe, and our
accident rate is among the lowest in
Europe. Even so our safety
performance is not a matter for
self-gratification.
Every year about 330,000 people
are killed or injured on our roads,
nearly 6,000 are killed, some 80,000
seriously injured and another 245,000
less seriously injured. On average a
road injury occurs every 99 seconds
and one person dies every 75 minutes.
Amongst men aged under 30 this is
the single most likely cause of death,
outweighing all types of diseases.
The single biggest cause of
accidents is driving with excess
speed; this, coupled with driving too
close to the car in front, leads to many
of the horrific motorway pile-ups.
How many people know the stopping
distance of a car travelling at 70mph?
It is little wonder then, that a line of
cars separated by about 20 feet and
travelling at about 60mph in fog is an
accident waiting to happen!
The single most effective method
of reducing the accident rate is to
press for better standards of driving.
There exists, in this country, two non-
profit-making charities, The Institute
of Advanced Motorists and the
RoSPA Advanced Drivers
Association, whose aim is just that.
To become a member involves a
1 '/2 hour test of both driving skills and
knowledge. Passing the test is not
necessarily the main object! The
evaluation carried out by one of the
examiners, all of whom hold Class 1
Police certificates, is what really
counts. From the assessment the
candidate can learn what is right about
his driving, and more important, what
he should do to improvefroma safety
point of view.
Many drivers have potentially fatal
flaws in their driving. It is surprising
the number of drivers who dip the
clutch before negotiating a bend,
instead of changing down. Or the
people who actually take both hands
off the steering wheel without
realising!
The Government Transport and
Road Research Lab has shown that
drivers who pass the entrance test are
50-70% less likely to have an accident
than the general motoring public,A
consequence of this is that they are
considered much better insurance
risks, and can save up to 30% on their
premiums.
If anyone would like more
information on advanced driving do
not hesitate to contact me, Daren
Austin, via the Physics pigeonholes.
The stopping distance at 70mph in
ideal conditions is 315 feet, so just
how good a driver are you?
