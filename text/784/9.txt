RAG
WEEK
SCAB NITE
Whaddaya mean you've never been
to a DramSoc play? Or an OpSoc
show, or a performance by IC
Orchestra or Choir? Well, now's your
chance. At SCAB Nite tomorrow
night, you can see all of IC's
performing societies 'doing their bit'
for Rag, on the Union Concert Hall
stage. Most of the performances are
more light-hearted than usual, whilst
a couple should be just plain
ridiculous.
Under the banner of the latter come
DebSoc's debate: This house believes
Captain Kirk is the ultimate dramatic
hero, proposed by the good captain
himself, and opposed by James Bond.
Also DramSoc's irreverent rendition
of Alice in Wonderland, starring the
DramSoc 'techies'—should be good
for a laugh.
On a rather less silly note, OpSoc
present Trial by Jury by Gilbert and
Sullivan, whose works they must
know back to front by now; DramSoc
are doing Alan Aycbourne's Between
Mouthfuls, and Choir sing the
Geographical Fugue. Jazz and Rock
Club have two bands appearing,
including The Rhythm Method,
College's new jazz heptet; there is an
(as yet unknown) ensemble from IC
Orchestra; and a bandfromthe newly
formed Folk Club. Those veterens of
SCAB Nite, the Trombone Trio, from
Chamber Music make a welcome
appearance, and include Tony Neal,
the Young Musician of the Year
finalist. The evening is rounded off
by Film Society, who will be showing
Barbarella in cinemascope, starring
Jane Fonda, into the wee small hours.
You get all this, and a cheap bar,
for a mere £2, all of which goes to
charity through IC Rag. So even if
you don't go to any other event in Rag
Week, go to SCAB Nite on Saturday
November 14 (tomorrow) at 8pm in
the Union Concert Hall. Alice in
Wonderland will never seem the same
again.
Richard Squire, SCAB Chairman.
Crisis at Christmas
This year, Crisis at Christmas will
organise its nineteenth pilgrimage
from Canterbury to London, now a
recognised annual event, which is
growing bigger by the year.
(Hopefully 500 walkers will turn out
this year.)
The money raised by sponsored
walkers (around £40,000 last year)
has given comfort and new hope to
many thousands of single, homeless
people; people without home or
family, often sleeping out and living
rough, during the winter months, with
little chance of a happy Christmas.
Yet there are still thousands more
who need your help, and you can give
that help by either joining the walk
itself on November 28 and 29, or by
sponsoring me! Keith Lowthian
(Chem Eng I), Falmouth-Keogh,
Room 379.
Sponsor forms should be found in
your CCU offices so please leave
your name etc and give generously to
this cause.
The pilgrimage itself is 60 miles in
length—no joke! It is traditionally
started by the Archbishop of
Canterbury in the grounds of the
Cathedral,finishingtwo days later
(having walked 34 miles of the first
day and 26 on the second) in
Southwark. The route consists of road
walking for the most part along the
none too scenic A2 and negotiates
such obstacles as Shooter's Hill (a 1l
A
mile gradual climb) and an even
worse climb out of Rochester.
If you are interested in walking,
either see me or write to:
Pilgrimage Office

Once again, please give us your
support and help the single homeless.
Cheers,
Keith Lowthian
