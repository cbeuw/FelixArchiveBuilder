Bobbling and
8
IC lsts V WLIHE
On Saturday the lsts played away
to the highly trained and coached
WLIHE. Partly due to a small pitch,
IC sporadically played disjointed,
scrappy hockey.' Paul Skipworth
dictated up front and scored IC's first
goal with his revolutionary bobbling
penalty flick (his total now being 14
goals, scoring in all of his 8 games).
Gary Knaresborough added to the
score with his maiden goal in the
second half. The defence was
confidently solid throughout the
game, Rolf Slatter being brilliantly
athletic between the posts (proving
again that even when approaching his
thirties, experience counts for far
more than youthful physical prowess
in the goalkeeping business). This
result gives IC a chance to top the
Middlesex lst division if they can win
against high flying Mill Hill on
Saturday.

Within seconds Steve Burton
produced ourfirstgoal. A solo goal
cutting through their defence. Five
minutes later BA equalised from
nowhere with a shot from the edge of
the D by an old defenceless looking
man. After some poor passing by AJ,
BA gained position, ran the ball
through our defence. The goal-keeper
came out to attack the BA player but
miss-kicking the ball, BA managed to
score with the loose ball.
The second IC goal came from
Vijay Thuker after complex passing
within the D before scoring.
BA's third goal was scored when
four from the two teams were on the
ground after the keeper had taken
them out.
The second half was almost the
usual IC 3rds game but they didn't
score any goals. Thefinalscore was
3-3.

Aggressive

IC lst 48-LSE 0
IC cruised to their third successive
win in the UAU competition, after a
solid performance against LSE.
Last year IC struggled against LSE.
But this year with Andy Watson at the
helm and Simon Smith on the
touchline, the boys are playing
aggressive, driving rugby up front
and swift, skilful play in the backs.
With two more games to go IC are
already assured of a place in the play
offs. The man of the match award
went to R Hargrove the Fresher No 8.
SAILING
Foggy foggy crew
Sailing
IC at Oxford
As the IC sailing team set off for
Oxford on a cold foggy Saturday
morning, the question in most sailors'
minds was: What the hell were they
doing out of bed at such an unearthly
hour when the prospects of sailing
were so dim.
By the time we reached Oxford
however, effective coaching by the
captain, combined with some signs
from the gods of wind that they have
not forgotten us forever, had helped
bring some life back into the IC team.
They then went forward to prove that
you don't need a force 6 wind to
perform most sailing manoeuvres,
including some rather complex racing
tactics. Richard Jarman, like any good
captain, showed us the way in the first
race which resulted in an IC victory.
The rest of the team followed his
example in the rest of the races, which
were sailed in a similar manner.
These nerve-racking manoeuvres
however resulted in the early
retirement of some crew members
that could not take the strain they
required.
Team: Richard Jarman, Rob
Kimberly, Apostolos
Leouidhopoulos, Sam Page, Jenny
Burton, Kath Drake.
