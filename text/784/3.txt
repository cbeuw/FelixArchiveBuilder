Music news
The College Music Committee has
been inspecting rooms which have
been put forward by College
administration as alternatives to the
Music Room to be lost i n Princes
Gate. The most satisfactory room is
Terminal Room A in the old Holland
Club, which is being converted into
rooms f o r the Department o f
Computing. Four rooms in Sherfield
have already been allocated as
practice rooms.
M r Malcolm Aldridge, a member
of the Music Committee, expressed
his disappointment at the loss of the
present music room. He said T am a
little sad. There is only one place in
the whole College which is ideally
suited to music making. There are
literally dozens of rooms which are
suitable f o r conferences and
seminars'.
I C U President Ian Howgate
acknowledged the progress which had
been made. He indicated, however,
that the Union would continue to fight
for the use of the Music Room.
Big Demo
There was a major demonstration
outside the Huxley Building on
Queensgate on Tuesday afternoon.
Members of the Bangladesh National
Party were protesting against the
ruling administration which seized
power in a military coup in 1981. A t
about 3.50pm members of the group
charged across the road to the doors
of the Bangladeshi Embassy. There
was a brief scuffle with police and
reinforcements were called in.
Within a couple of minutes 6 police
cars, 7 bikes, 2 vans of policemen and
2 mounted policemen arrived. The
group were forced back to the other
side o f the road where the
demonstrators got increasingly angry.
When F E L I X approached members
of the group they claimed that the
military regime had assassinated M r
Siaur Rahman who ruled for 5 years
under a democratic system. Since the
coup there had been hundreds of
people killed in Bangladesh and much
of the countries wealth h a d
disappeared.
The 1987 Rag Mag was launched at
the Beer Festival on Wednesday. The
Rector, Eric Ash, bought the first
copy for £5 from the editor, Gehen
de Silva Wijeyeratne. Later 700
copies were sold from the rag stall at
the cover price of 50 pence. This is
the first new Rag Mag produced at
Imperial for some years after
controversy over the contents o f
previous editions.
The Beer Festival itself was a great
success, with takings of over £5,300
and a profit for Rag of over £2,100.
Many students attended the Festival
to sample the large variety of Beers
on offer.
Surrey saga continues

Surrey University have still to write
officially to Imperial College Union
about the events that happened two
weeks ago last Wednesday, when
visiting I C sports teams caused
trouble in their bar.
A motion concerning the trouble
was passed at the weekly Surry Union
General Meeting (UGM) on Tuesday,
although a stronger worded motion
put to the previous U G M was rejected
after pressure from Surry sports
teams. The original motion called for
the banning of IC students from
Surrey's Union Building and the
signing in of visiting sports teams,
neither of which were contained in the
motion which was passed.
I C U President Ian Howgate has
sent a letter to the Chairperson of
Surrey's U G M which apologised for
any trouble that was caused, and
which contained reports from the
Imperial sports teams that were
present. When contacted by F E L I X ,
Surrey's President Andy Young said
he would be writing back by the
beginning of next week.
In the meantime, copies of front
cover o f last week's F E L I X ,
containing this story, were distributed
on the Surrey campus by their sports
teams after a piece published i n the
Surrey Student Newspaper 'Bare
Facts' which made no attempt to put
both sides of the story.

The second Imperial College Union
Council this year took place on
j Monday evening. A suggestion that
i Compact Discs should be bought to
; replace many of the worn out records
i in the Haldane Library was rejected,
;
in favour of a proposal to purchase
cassette tapes. It was pointed out that
although a large number of students
have cassette players, less have the
equipment for playing C D ' s and
records.
A proposal by I C U President Ian
Howgate that U n i o n General
Meetings should be held every other
week in the J C R resulted in much
debate. The first U G M held there two
weeks ago was a success, but Ian felt
that it lasted too long and motions
iwere not discussed. He pointed out
that more regular U G M ' s would
result i n less business for each
meeting. There was opposition,
however, from members who thought
that many students have other
committments at lunchtimes when the
meetings would be held, and it would
result in problems scheduling clubs'
events and meetings. It was decided
to refer the matter to the next U G M
for a further discussion before a
decision was taken.
The non-attendence of some of the
members of Council resulted i n a
proposal that any member who cannot
attend and does not send a proxy or
acceptable apology would be fined
£5, to be donated to rag.
