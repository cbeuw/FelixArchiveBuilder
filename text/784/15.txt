'It hasn't been organised—I just
solder things together.'
So commented STOIC's Technical
Manager on their new Through the
Night schedule starting at 10pm
tonight, but some organisation must
have gone into it to provide eleven
hours of featurefilms,music videos,
features and interviews. It finishes
just after 9am on Saturday with
breakfast with the ICU Exec. A full
schedule of this exciting new venture
in student broadcasting is given
below.
If you're up in time on Saturday
after a night spent glued to the box,
don't miss 'Alio 'Alio (7.20pm,
BBC1) where we rejoin Rene & Co
escaping from a prisoner of war camp
dressed as girls from the Folies
Bergere.
Humour in a very different vein is
later the same evening with Saturday
Almost Live (11pm, C4) repeating
some of the best of their popular live
Sport
It's an early morning for those
without videos on Sunday when The
Australian Grand Prix (7.20am,
BBC2) is broadcast live (well
almost—only two hours late). Piquet
may already have the World
Championship, with the possible re-
emergence of Ferrari in time for the
new season.
Game Shows
Highlight of the week is Treasure
Hunt, cruelly switched to Sunday
afternoons (lpm, C4) but losing none
of Aneka Rice's bubbly charm
tempered only by Kenneth Kendalls
autbority ('cos he knows the
answers).
Music
Still on Saturday, you might consider
Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony
(8.15pm, BBC2 and Radio 3)
performed by the BBC Welsh
Symphony Orchestra, with the added
extra of a stereo FM simulcast.
Drama & Documentary
Saturday sees the return of the
insincere duo Cagney & Lacey
(9.20pm, BBC1). More predictable
plots, unimaginative endings and bad
acting.
Next Friday sees the continuing,
excellent documentary about the
activities of Customs & Excise (The
Duty Men, BBC2, 9pm), this week
focusing on Poteen Manufacture in
Ulster.
Cartoons
There are some great repeats being
shown on Saturday but you may
require an early start to catch them,
or a video! Roobarb (9.20am, BBC1)
not seen since our teens, brings happy
memories; and later (about 10.30am,
ITV) during No. 73, a showing of The
Trapdoor is a must and has been
described as 'Morph on acid'.
FELIX Friday November 13th 1987 15
