What's in a game?
Business games come in all shapes
and sizes, but anyone who can think
logically is capable of playing them.
They are played in teams which
compete, using their own strategies,
to gain most money.
Each game lets you become, for a
few hours, the managing executive of
an independent company. You decide
on key issues affecting its
performance, such as lowering prices
(gaining customers but reducing profit
margins) or tendering for contracts
(profitable in the long run but risking
initial cash-flow problems). The final
outcome will rest on your decisions,
but also on those of your competitors.
After 2 or 3 repetitions of the
decision-making process a winner of
the game emerges.
Membership of the Industrial
Society (£1.50 for the year) allows
you to take part in such games, which
are run by the companies which have
designed them. Each company tends
to provide travelling expenses, lunch
or dinner during the game, and
information about themselves. Games
are usually held on Wednesday
afternoons, finishing at around 6pm
or 7pm.
Only thirty places are available on
each, so early application is advised.
The games are fun whether you're
aiming for large profits, deficits, or
just a slander campaign against your
competitors. You'll also learn a great
deal about businesses and how they
are run. If you'd like to play, choose
one from the list below, and give a
returnable deposit cheque, payable to
ICUSCC, to Man Tai Tseung, Chem
Eng 4 (Business Games Organiser,
Indsoc).

Clubs Editor's note: it's great that so many clubs are writing in (and
sending pictures), but this means that space is tight and waffly articles
will be cut short. This week I've rewritten a lot to save all the facts, so
if your article isn't exactly as you wrote it, you know what's happened.
In future I may just cut out the last paragraphs...To avoid this, be concise.

Challenge
Throughout central London last
Wednesday, eight teams took part in
an event organised by the National
Students Industrial Society and
lavishly sponsored by British
Telecom. They raised £500 for the
charity, Childline (the telephone
service launched from TV's
Childwatch).
The challenge involved racing to
nine companies, collecting a list of
questions from each, and phoning the
questions back to a base team to
solve. BT provided £175 in prizes, as
well as free phonecards and travel-
cards and a huge banquet at the end
of the day. A superb time was had by
everyone involved.
Unfortunately IC Industrial Society
could not attend as they were 'too
tired after organising the Careers
Fair'. Civ Eng 1 stepped in just in
time to save IC from being branded
totally apathetic.
Despite short notice our team of six
put up a very creditable performance,
coming fifth.
Thank you, everybody, and if IC
Indsoc can't get its act together in the
future, we'll do it again.

Night drive
The second round of the Motor Club
championship, the Freshers' Rally,
took place in a waterlogged
Hampshire on October 23/24.
These rallies take place at night,
and are scheduled for 30 mph, a lot
faster than it sounds given the amount
of time taken to translate the
navigation into a route on the map,
and the narrow, twisty nature of the
roads used.
Victorious at the end of the 100
mile route were the ultra-experienced
pair of Paul Dent and Paul Brooks-
Johnson in their Escort Mk I. Second
were Duncan Royle and Ian Hamill
and third was thefirstfresher, Mark
Putt, who navigated for Lee Stanley.
The next round of the champion-
ship is tonight on OS map 175.

Fused style
The Tang Soo Do Club, IC's latest
athletics club, was formed on
Monday. Tang Soo Do is the Korean
art of self-defence developed by
Grand Master Hwang Kee, who
followed tradition in carefully
selecting his students to ensure the
perpetuation of the martial arts. This
particular system is a fusion of the art
of Soo Bahk Do and Chinese fighting
systems, and is characterised by a
large repertoire of kicking techniques.
Its best-known user is probably the
former martial arts champion, Chuck
Norris.
A typical class consists of execution
of basic movements, basic technique
and free-fighting. We train every
Monday in the Southside Gym at 9pm
and every Saturday in the Union Gym
at 4pm. Our club instructor is Sa Bom
Nim Yap (4th dan black belt).
FILM
Vegetarian?
Little Shop of Horrors
A fun-filled fiction horror spoof,
directed by Frank Oz of the Muppet
Show.
Life goes on as normal in Skid
Row, until Seymour, an orphan who
works in a small plant shop, discovers
a strange plant. He nurtures and cares
for it, discovering that it feeds on
blood, and later on whole people. The
plant grows in size, and meanness,
until its true purposes are revealed.
