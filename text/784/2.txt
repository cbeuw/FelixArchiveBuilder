For all of you who didn't manage to
get a copy of last week's issue, may
I apologise once more. We have been
experiencing severe equipment
difficulties in the Print Unit: all three
printing presses gave up the ghost,
leaving us with only 1500 finished
copies at 9.25am last Friday. A s I
write this, the new press has just been
completely turned over and hopefully
fixed. This means, unfortunately, that
the waiting list for print jobs is now
stretching well into December and the
Print Unit Manager is worn out and
ready for replacement!
Rag Week
I realised just how mean and miserly
some of you are this week. It was a
nice idea to ask for 20p for each small
ad and diary entry, or so I thought,
but the number of times people just
turned around and walked out of the
door when I told them that they'd
have to donate to charity this week
shocked me. 20p is the price of a
chocolate bar, a tabloid, or a quarter
of a pint of beer. This said, I would
like to thank everyone who did
contribute.
Debt, Degrees and Damp
It was announced at Council this week
that College administration are
expecting to lose around 500 head
tenancy places in Hamlet Gardens,
Lexham Gardens and Earls Court
Square. O n further investigation,
F E L I X discovered that 50 places are
definitely going next year, forcing
more students into the private sector.
It has to be this year that we make the
decision whether to campaign for
increased benefits/grants in order to
cover the rise in the cost of living, poll
tax, rent increases and such, or to
resign ourselves to the fact that in
order to complete our degrees in
London we must find a part-time job,
find sponsorship or take out massive
loans. I can only talk from my own
situation: I have one more year of
Physics to complete and I am not a
sponsored student. M y family live on
the outskirts of Greater London in a
Conservative run borough which will
only give me a full grant if I live in
College accommodation. Next year,
if I don't want to get into debt, I will
have to live at home (it takes just over
Vh hours to commute in every
morning) and as I will get no
travelling expenses, any grant I do
receive will go to British Rail and
London Transport. The alternative is
to drop my degree and find a job. I
am confident that I could start at
around £10,000pa. There would be
no debt, no rising damp, no exams
and money in my pocket. It's very
tempting. It must be very tempting for
others in my position.
