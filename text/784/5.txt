Safe sex is to be on
sale in Norman's,
the Union Snack
Bar, following the
launch of Richard
Branson's 'Mates'
condoms which
M r Branson's latest venture into
inflatable objects coincides
conveniently with IC Rag Week—in
plenty o f time f o r the Slave
Auction—and all profits will go
directly to the Virgin Healthcare
Foundation. The Foundation was
officially launched on 10th November
to provide support for 'major health
care issues and crises in society'.
Condoms are to become the latest
fashion accessory amongst trendy,
young people. Available across the
counter and in vending machines in
may be purchased
along with veggie
samosas and the
Guardian.
places such as pubs, toilets, grocers,
W H Smiths and, yes, Virgin Record
Stores, the new range comes in four
varieties: standard, ribbed, coloured
and strong, along with Play Mates.
The AIDS publicity icebergs and all
have broken down the barriers to
mentioning 'condoms' even on T V
and the sight of the first condom
advert is only at the end of the
Underground at Uxbridge (anagram
Big Durex). Virgin and its Healthcare
Foundation are planning a massive
advertising campaign in order to
remove any embarrassment attached
to purchasing, carrying and using
condoms. So you don't have to be shy
when you ask for a condom with rice
and extra cheese tonight in the Snack
Bar.
The 'Mates' launch m a y
accidentally and coincidentally bring
Branson an awful lot of publicity—
as did falling into icy cold water,
which reminds me of a certain
advert...

Hopefully his attempts to clean up
sex will be more successful than that
of street litter, or has he found a new
use for all those brooms.
Interesting
Condom
Facts
• Only 2 condoms are purchased per
head (?) of the population in Great
Britain. (In Japan it's 7 per head).
• Shares in Japan's leading condom
manufacturer have tripled in the same
year as Virgin shares were floated.
• In Sweden all schoolchildren are
made to practice putting a condom on
a wooden penis.
• In France they are already putting
vending machines for condoms in
schools.
• In Kenya sales of condoms have
increased from 10,000 a month i n
1986 to 300,000 a month today.
• In Australia the favourite condom
promotion song is entitled 'Roll it on
Robbie'.
• Some Catholic priests in Ireland
have stated that use of condoms is fine
if the intention is to prevent AIDS
rather than pregnancy.
Getting young people to accept the
idea of using condoms will be difficult
as at present only 10% of sexually-
active people under 25 use them.
Richard Branson in his usual homely
manner made the following comment:
'if you give up sugar in your tea you
won't like it for a few days. After that
you won't notice the difference.'
