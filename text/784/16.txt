Slamdance
Although, technically speaking,
Wayne Wang's Slamdance can be
classed along with a growing batch of
American movies directed by
Orientals, it can be much more
closely associated with the recent
batch of oddball thrillers in which the
main character gets involuntarily
dragged from his safe, normal world
into a nightmare sub-world of fear
and horror (Blue Velvet, After Hours
and Something Wild being the better
examples of the genre).
The central character here is
Drood, a painter and artist (played by
Tom Hulce), who appears practically
continuously in the film, which is no
great shame as his performance is
easily the most enjoyable to watch and
his character is the only one allowed
enough scope to develop. The
gateway to his nightmare opens when
the woman he has just recentiy
finished an affair with is murdered;
he has been sent incriminating
photographs of her with public figures
and on top of this the police are tyring
to frame him with the murder.
The problem with the film is that
neither the storyline nor the script are
ever really strong enough, and the
sub-plots in the movie such as Hulce's
relationship with his estranged wife
and their daughter 'Bean', or Hulce's
internal wranglings over whether or
not he really loved his ex-mistress
Elandra Caldwell are never strongly
developed. The support is also weak:
the usually reliable Harry Dean-
Stanton is mediocre as the semi-
honest cop, Smiley. Adam Ant and
John Doe also make only half-worthy
contributions to the action. Only Don
Opper, as the hoodlum, with a warm
heart, who has to hassle Hulce
manages to impress. Again, it is only
Hulce who shines, as the twisted look
and boyish smile are used as
effectively as they were in Amadeus.
Wang also shows some nice touches
throughout the film, but the pace
chops from slam-bang-wollop to
stillness too abruptly.
All this may sound very negative,
and although it doesn't quite live up
to the standards of the films in whose
wake it is following, Slamdance is an
enjoyable film, and you could do a lot
worse than to go and see it; it's just
on leaving the cinema one has the
feeling that although it was good, it
could have been a lot better.

Let's Hope it's a Girl
Despite Liv Ullman's touching
portrayal of a woman coming to terms
with adversity and Catherine
Deneuve's occasional appearance,
thisfilmdoes not have much to offer.
Two hours of struggling with the
subtitles of this Italian film was only
acceptable because the plot was so
slow moving I didn't miss any of the
film by having to read them.
Without men, Elena (Liv Ullman)
copes with a failing estate, the death
of her estranged husband and the
seeming desertion of all her brood.
The strong feminist undertones
surface in the last scene, where all the
women, united and facing their
problems together, prepare and eat a
meal. The only man present, dotty old
Uncle Gugo, symbolically doesn't eat
with them, but sits to one side knitting
socks for horses.
I don't expect many students would
enjoy this film: on a rainy afternoon
with nothing better to do I would
rather sit in the rain and save the
money.

The Rescuers
First released in 1977, Walt Disney
is trying to make some more money
from The Rescuers re-released last,
week. Created from over 2'/2 million
separate drawings it is well worth
seeing. In true Disney style there are
lots of goodies (the mice) and baddies
(Medusa), plenty of action and a
happy ending. What more could you
ask for?
If you do go and see it watch out
for the remarkable likeness between
the evil Medusa and our very own
Mrs Thatcher.

The Magic Toyshop
The latest offeringfromthe poison
pen of Angela Carter wasfilmedbut
never generally released, appearing
on video instead. Following in the
wake of The Company of Wolves this
production certainly deserved
investigation.
It concerns the fate of Melanie
(Caroline Milmoe), an innocent
teenager who is tragically orphaned
and is forced to stay with her sadistic
Uncle Philip. He owns a toyshop in
south London and is obsessed with
puppets, forcing his family (consisting
of his dumb wife and two toys) to
watch strange plays he writes and
performs using the mannequins he
lovingly creates. These become
increasingly bizarre and eventually
involve Melanie herself as the divide
between fantasy and reality is blurred.
The film provides a captivating
atmosphere of magical fantasy, with
mysterious forces and sexual intrigue
weaving a complex thread. However,
the characters do not develop beyond
fairy-tale stereotypes which deprives
them of any real interest and although
the ideas are effectively executed, the
strangeness soon becomes tedious due
the total absence of plot and the film
quickly becomes vacuous. Rather
than the thought-provoking Company
of Wolves, The Magic Toyshop left me
feeling cheated of any stimulating
conclusion.
