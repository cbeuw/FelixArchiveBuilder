Notice Boards
At last I'm asking for applications for
the use of noticeboards this year.
Application forms for the use of
noticeboards are available from my
office on Monday next.
Hall Insurance
Cheques are in my office for the
following people:
E O Gedney
J Calvin
C Nisbier
S Durrant
C Flores
A Nuttall
Anyone who has an outstanding
claim for a considerable length of time
ie from before Easter should see me
so I can chase up these claims. Some
of them may require further
information but due to the mess of
records left by my illustrious
predecessor, it is often difficult to tell
which.
Clubs and Societies Insurance
The Insurance Company are asking
for an updated inventory for all
property of clubs and societies. For
anyone who has not provided me with
one there are blank forms in the
pigeonholes in the Union Office.
After you've looked at the ceiling (49 times),
the floor (58 times), the walls (99 times), you
can either do some more work or look at
the ceiling again...
College life isn't really what you expected. New
horizons seem to have resolved themselves into
four walls and a ceiling.
New friends have ended up being thirty
strangers in a lecture hall.
Additional entertainment is provided by
your next door neighbour who won't turn his radio
down.
Wed like to offer a ray of hope. We
believe there is someone who knows about
loneliness and cares about your situation. During
week eight there will be opportunities to hear
more about Him.
"There is a friend who sticks closer
than a brother" Proverbs 8:24
A series of events
in week eight, Nov 23-28
organised by Imperial
College Christian Union 8
Anything not notified (or even put
under the heading of miscellaneous)
will not be insured.
There seems to be outstanding
claims on this policy and contact with
the clubs or societies concerned will
be helpful.
Parking Permits
The process of allocation and re-
allocation has now finished. As
indicated previously in FELIX
anyone originally allocated a permit
who didn't pick it up by Monday
November 2 was assumed to no
longer want one. Those were re-
allocated using the appeals forms
which I had already received. The
lucky people who can pick up their
permit from my office are:
F Sutcliffe, EBU 354W
Castro, XLT 7175
S Mortezai, CLK 584T
Rita Bento, Nl-28-03
Kangblo Lee, A 386 JKN
K H Lee, SU 61X
D Anastassopoulos, GHJ 53IS
D Nicolson, RGW 662X
G Ratnasingham, E969 V90
I have heard reports of accusations
of the allocations being unfair. All I
can say is that the allocations
procedure was as fair as possible
given that the present system is
inadequate. I will produce
recommendations for changing it so
that my successor won't have the
same problems.
Royal College of
Science Union
In view of the chivalrous behaviour of the City and Guilds Union and
the Royal School of Mines in avoiding an outbreak of serious violence
during the lunchtime of Friday, November 6, the Royal College of Science
have decided that 10% of the money collected on their 24 Hour Collection
will be given to each of the other CCUs.
