Football Crazy
IC III 3-IC II 2
IC 3rds came to their second league
match against IC 2nds in high spirits
after some good results, but it was
plain that the 2nds were in a
determined mood after last week's 2-2
draw. The 3rds struck a free kick by
Chris Budgen was laid off to Fergus
Batstone who turned sharply and fired
in a low cross that Chris Morris
converted perfectly. Fifteen minutes
later Alan Glass added a second after
a Chris Morris back-header and the
3rds began to believe that it would be
their day. The 2nds had other ideas
however, and began to play as they
knew they could, Pip Peel was
causing lots of trouble to the 3rds
defence and Dan Thomas was always
dangerous. The real star (as ever) was
Niel Vandenbegin, but it was Adam
who pulled one back for the 2nds just
before half-time after a slight
defensive error. The second half
began with the 3rds determined to
hold their lead, but they could not
believe their luck when Fergus
Batatone duped the 2nds keeper from
the edge of the box to put the thirds
3-1 up. After this the 2nds really
began to play, Paul Thompson and
Smart Miller made probing runs from
the back and John West was creating
lots of space in the midfield. The 2nds
pressure paid off at last when a cross
by Adam Thomas was headed home
by P P Peel, but unfortunately for the
2nds they couldn't create any more
real chances, even though they
controlled the rest of the match. The
final whistle went with the 3rds the
winner, but judging by the way the
2nds played it will be very surprising
if they don't win the league come the
end of the season.

IC Ills 3-LSE Ills 0
IC Ills approached their 3rd game of
the UAU competition needing a win
to have any chance of going through
the regional division. The IC captain
won the toss and decided to attack
against the wind in the lst half.
Neither team settled down properly
and IC were content to contain LSE,
knowing that with the advantage of
the wind in the second half they
should be able to take the points. The
lst half ended scoreless, with very
few goal attempts apartfroma couple
of half chances that fell to Fergus
Batstone.
IC began the second half well,
Chris Morris and Mark Woodgate
won everything in the air and the ball
was rarely seen by goalkeeper Julian
Henson. Move after move took IC
nearer to opening the scoring,
Graham Day came close and Fergus
continued to cause problems to the
LSE defence. Eventually the
breakthrough came, a goalmouth
scramble saw Paul Nevillefinishwell
and LSE began to crumble. IC began
to completely dominate the game, a
run from the defence gave Kevin
Graves a 1 on 1 with the keeper who
saved well and after coming close
with a powerful shot. Graham Day
slotted in the second when Fergus
robbed the LSE keeper. LSE had
nothing more to give and Paul Neville
(ICs answer to Gary Lineker)
continued his excellent scoring form
by getting the third 5 minutes from
time.
IC Vs 5—KQC Vis 1
IC Vs achieved their second win of
the season last Wednesday in a hard
fought game against KQC Vis. The
match was evenly balanced until the
twentieth minute when Glenn Evans
scored the first of his magnificent
hattrick. No one was more surprised
than him to see his 20 yard effort loop
over the goalkeeper and drop just
under the bar. KQC fought back hard,
and but for some brave defending by
our illustrious leader, veteran Jon
Turner, and the rest of the star-
studded defence, the game might have
gone the way of so many others this
season. KQC did equalise ten minutes
later. Approaching half-time, IC
continued to counter-attack and were
rewarded by another goalfromGlenn
Evans, this time a 12 yard angled
drive beyond the keeper. The score
remained 2-1 until, in the second half,
with the wind in our favour, Glenn
complete his hattrick by beating two
defenders and prodding the ball past
the despairing keeper.
Midway through the second half,
the goal of the season so far was
scored by Steve Von Bargen—our
goalkeeper! A long kick resulted in
the ball bouncing on the penalty spot
and over the head of the other keeper
into the goal. Last, but not least, our
fifth goal was scored by the right-back
Mike Wilson after a move started in
our own penalty area.
A sad note is the loss of our
midfield player Hemang, carried off
with a fractured ankle.
Next summer, a group of students
from Imperial College will be
travelling to India with the aim of
crossing the Eastern Himalaya
through Bhutan to Tibet, and them
continuing across China to Beijing.
Any budding explorers interested im
taking part in this expedition are
invited to apply for a place now.
EXPEDITION
Explorers
this way
Some mountain trekking experience
would be an advantage though not
essential. The cost of the trip will be
met partly by sponsorship. Give
names to H Sullivan or D Strowbridge
(ME 3), for more details as soon as
possible.
This will be an equal opportunities
expedition!
IC IT—3 vs LSE II—0
With points at stake in the UAU and
League, IC needed a good
performance to continue their
unbeaten run. Paul Thompson
replaced the injured Jezz Holland, in
the heart of the defence, and Adam
Thomas made a welcome return after
his ventures into lst team football.
Playing against the wind in the first
half, IC soon got to work. Pip Peel
opened IC's account, finishing off
with a spectacular lob, having been
put through in usual style. Towards
the end of the well-fought half, Guy
Phiri latched on to another ball,
rounded the keeper and slotted the
ball home. Playing with the wind in
the second half, IC camped in LSE's
half. However, pressure was not
rewarded with goals, until Adam
Thomas crashed a volley into the net,
from outside the box. This victory
means IC will get to at least the
regional playoffs for the last 16 in the
UAU.
Team: S Holden, S Miller, R Dark,
P Thompson (capt), M Plummer, R
Muthoo, P Peel, J West, J Muller, A
Thomas, G Phiri.
ORIENTEERING
Running
wild
On Sunday the Orienteering Club
attended theirfifthevent of the season
at Chelmsford. The weather stayed
fine although it was bitterly cold
making orienteers run faster than
usual. The event colour-coded with
only blue and green courses mapped
out but this only meant that there was
more competition within the Club. A
few members of Oxford University
were spotted and their results closely
watched as they are competing in an
inter-university match in the future.
The orienteers this week were: M
Lynas, A Horrocks, R Haddock, T
.Foster, C Hargreaves, R Magini, A
Thompson, A Fazakerley.
