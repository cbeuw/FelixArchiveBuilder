Mascotry attempt foiled
N e w s
JAn attempt was made to take the
[Royal College of Science Union
l(RCSU) mascot, a large thermometer
jcalled Theta, last Friday, Only 30
people had turned up to an RCS
General Meeting which was taking
place in the Union Lower Lounge.
When City and Guilds Union
(C&GU) President Dave Tyler heard
â€¢of the lack of numbers, he lead those
in the union office over to the Union
building, stopping in the Bar to enlist
the help of some Royal School of
Mines (RSM) students.
On reaching the Lounge, they
sealed off the room, although RCS
had barricaded the doors and they
could not get in. After about a minute,
RCS then passed Theta out through
a window into the Beit Quadrangle.
It had nearly reached Beit Arch when
some Guildsmen shut the iron gates
barring the exit to Prince Consort
Road.
For a while it looked as there could
be some violence with the RCS
mascot trapped in the Quad.
However, in an attempt to avoid
trouble, Mr Tyler invoked a rule
claiming that they had 'overwhelming
numbers' and that the mascot should
be handed over to them. At the time,
the RCSU members present were
probably outnumbered, but not by a
large amount, according to ICU
Deputy President Alan Rose, who
was called in to adjudicate the count.
While a count was being arranged
and the two groups were separating,
the two RCS Theta Bearers, Dan
Pluta and Dave Burns, took Theta
secretly back through the Union
Building, passed the Albert Hall, and
onto Kensington Gore. There, after
some delay they hailed a taxi, telling
Sid, the driver "This is possibly the
greatest moment of your driving
career". The taxi then drew off
towards Knightsbridge. Meanwhile,
some RCS students sat on the bonnet
of a car being used by C&GU to chase
the mascot.
While the taxi was waiting at the
traffic lights at the top of Exhibition
Road, a red Metro being driven by
Tim Clark pulled up behind the taxi.
One of the occupants, Chris Adams,
got out and stood in front of Mr
Clark's car while the taxi drove off.
Mr Clark then drove slowly forward
and Mr Adams did not move. Mr
Clark then drove forward again, and
Mr Adams ended up on the bonnet
while the car drove around the corner
and stopped out of the traffic. The car
RCSU mascot, Theta, making an unconventional getaway
had some minor damage to the
bonnet, while Mr Adams had a stiff
knee for the rest of the day.
Clare McErlane, the President of
the RCSU, said afterwards that "they
were very glad they still had their
mascot'', and felt that if the attack had
been better planned it would have
succeeded. C&GU President Dave
Tyler said that the spirit of mascotry
was adhered to, although the Vice
Presidents of all the CCU's would be
getting together after Rag Week to
formalise the rules as regards
mascotry. When asked about his
feelings when RCS smuggled away
Theta during the count, he said he
would have done the same thing, but
expected RCSU to pay a fine for
doing so. It was better, he said, to pay
a fine and keep your mascot.
An IC Union executive meeting
later agreed that 20% of the total from
the RCS 24 hour Rag Collection
should be split between the other
CCU's.
Later that evening C&GU make
another attempt when they
unsuccessfully tried to follow the van
containing Theta after the RCSU Life
Science Freshers Dinner.
Fifty places to go
There will be at least 160 less places
available in Head Tenancy flats next
year. The contract on the '220' block
in Hamlet Gardens, holding about 130
students, is not being renewed by the
landlords. This was known last year,
and a new block, containing 80
students in flats for four was taken
over as Head Tenancies this year,
leaving a drop over the two years of
50.
The remaining loss is from the 8
Earls Court Square building which
houses 30 students. The landlord is
probably not renewing the contract
for economic reasons, although
negotiations are still continuing.
The other main block of Head
Tenancies, in Lexham Gardens, are
due to be renewed in February. Every
year the negotiations have been more
difficult as the landlords have
demanded more. An additional
problem this year might be the
withdrawal of Housing Benefit, which
could put the Lexham Gardens prices
out of the reach of many students.
The College is still looking for new
Head Tenancies, although with the
prices of property around the College
area being so high, there is a problem
in that the only buildings in a
reasonable price range are not in an
acceptable condition for housing
students, and there is no point in
offering College Head Tenancies that
have no advantages in cost, distance
or facilities over commercially
available property.
B R I
Blood
155 pints of blood were donated by
staff and students last Friday. The
donations were in response to a plea
by City and Guilds Union after they
were fined 50 pints of blood for
disrupting the Freshers' Reception.
Making history
STOIC, the television network of
Imperial College, will be
broadcasting all night tonight for the
first time in their history. The
transmission is scheduled to start at
10.00pm and end sometime on
Saturday morning.
More minibuses
There will be a minibus service to
take women home after the Guilds
Carnival next Friday night. This
follows the success of a similar
scheme run in Freshers' Week.
New officer
Interviews will be taking place on
Tuesday for the new IC Union
Finance Officer.
Crashing down
John Redwood, Conservative MP for
Wokingham and former Head of
Downing Street Policy Unit, spoke to
Imperial College students on
Tuesday. He was assessing the stock
market crash last month and looking
at the possibility of another
worldwide recession like the one that
followed the crash of 1929.
Smoking Concert
There will be at least twenty acts at
this year's Smoking Concert, it was
disclosed by RCSU Entertainments
Officer Steph Snell. The Concert is
to feature the FELIX staff in a
stunning portrayal of the classic
'Baron' series.
Scandalous
Only one infiveof the academic staff
recruited to universities in 1985 were
female, it was revealed by the
Association of University Teachers'
women's committee this week.
