Junk Aesthetics
With the advent of the found
footage phenomenon in recent
advertising campaigns (ranging from
lager to deodorant) and its
proliferation in the realm of music
video, this collection of short films
traces the origins of a traditionally
avant-garde technique. The show at
the ICA concentrates on the work of
Bruce Conner and consists of nine
films, six of which are his, covering
the period from 1930 to 1980.
They rangefroma bitingly satirical
view of Kennedy's assassination
(Report, Conner 1965) which has
inspired many a dancefloor classic,
through early 'music videos'
(Mongoloid Devo, Conner 1978 and
America is Waiting Eno/Byrne,
Conner 1980) to technical
experimentation in the form of early
solarisation effects (Berlin Horse,
LeGrice 1970); there is even what
purports to be a very young Marilyn
Monroe posing nude to a tragically
ironic song, cut up and repeated
OMarilyn Five Times, Conner 1973),
but is it really her?
Like all avant-garde work this
collection, some of which is being
released for the first time, suffers
from only partial success, with some
ideas being stretched just a little too
far. However, the range and scope of
the set as a whole is remarkable and
some sections are a pure delight. In
the main the films are ironic and
sarcastic, with the power of newsreel
footage used critically to good effect.
A rare treat for the daring.

She's Gotta Have It!
The release of this 'seriously sexy
comedy' on video follows a record-
breaking independent run—a
welcome change for a film shot in
black and white with an all-black cast.
Nola (Tracy Camila Johns) is a
successful paste-up artist, living in
Brooklyn. To her, men are either
decent, or dogs. Trouble is she's
found three decent ones and doesn't
want to choose between them.
There's the sensitive and caring Jamie
(Richard Hicks), smooth and arrogant
Greer (John Terrell) and the hip and
lively Mars (Spike Lee, who also
wrote and directed the film).
Their respective attempts to upstage
each other form a hilarious portrayal
of male rivalry as the prospective
suitors fight for Nola.
Altogether a sharp and witty study
of modern relationships neatly turned
around. One criticism though; who
pays £35 for a video these days?

£34.99.)

Romeo & Juliet
by W. Shakespeare
Many Shakespearean productions
involve no more than hammed-up
poetry and dusty old costumes. I was
beginning to believe that no director
had the ability to make such work
relevant to a modern audience.
However, Jeremy Bell's Romeo &
Juliet at the Young Vic has returned
much of my lost faith.
It is set in the 1980s: the Montagu's
and Capulets are wealthy,
sophisticated business families, the
Nurse a zany brummie and the Priest
a black vicar.
Shakespeare's wordy sonnets are
spoken naturally (even the cliched
"Romeo, Romeo, where for art
thou"...etc). Romeo (Richard Huw)
and Juliet (Sarah-Jane Fenton) are
played as rough-edged teenagers who
find themselves immersed in emotions
that they can neither understand nor
control. Their powerful love story
unfolds.
Towards the very end of the play
the direction seems to lose its way,
but this was more than compensated
for by the remarkable power and
imagination of earlier scenes.
It is frightening that a play of such
jealousy, hatred and violence as well
love can be as relevant to our lives
as it was to the Elizabethans.

Vic, SE1.)

THEA
The Rover
by Aphra Behn
After a highly successful season in
Stratford, the Royal Shakespeare
Company is starting The Rover again
at the Mermaid Theatre. With very
few changes to the cast and a brilliant
preview performance it is set to have
an equally successful London season.
Jeremy Irons plays the lead role of
the Rover; a wild philandering
womanizer who regards sex as the
prime objective in life. I always think
that on television and film Mr Irons
is such a drip, but his stage
performance is excellent; he is the
perfect actor for the character.
The lively and bubbly Geraldine
Fitzgerald and Imogen Stubbs play
two of the three sisters who break free
to enjoy the carnival. These two are
exemplary of the whole cast, who
exude the same infectious sense of
enjoyment.
The Rover is easy to follow, fun to
watch and brilliantly performed, and
with student concessions and standby
tickets available this is a play not to
be missed.
