RAG MAG OR RAG DRAG?
The mid-sixties saw
the troubled birth
of the Imperial
College Rag Mag,
a publication
destined time and
time again to cause
controversy. Under
the editorship of
David Irwine, the
first issue
underwent
censorship of an
entire 16 page
supplement, and
few subsequent
issues have been
spared from similar
notoriety. The
current issue is
unlikely to remain
unscathed; no doubt
some puritanical
members of the
general public will
be critical of the
front cover!
A distressing feature of the Rag Mags
of other, lesser institutions is their
tendancy to regurgitate the same
material issue after issue. The IC
version has always prided itself on its
originality, to the extent of being
a period of hostility between the Rag
Mag editors and ICU Executive
officers.
Although the balance was redressed
the next year, 1981 once again saw
trouble, with Patrick Coil's
the second school of thought, but like
all such things, has passed through the
hands of the ICU Censorship
Committee, and has benefited from
close cooperation between the Rag
committee and the ICU Executive.
Given adequate time, an editor
should be able to prepare a magazine
which is not only runny, but which
demonstrates the ability of IC to
produce wacky writers and wild
cartoonists. It is possible that there
may be pressure on future editors to
follow the trend set by this one,
especially if we prove successful. The
present practice of preparing the Rag
Mag over Summer doesn't really
leave enough time for this, and many
on this year's committee feel that the

trend setting: Mike Williams, the
Editor in 1972, is widely credited
with the introduction of dead baby
jokes, which now feature in
practically every Rag Mag going.
This year's, for example, is the first
ever to introduce the 'non joke'.
Any efforts to track down IC Rag
Mags from the sixties proves futile,
as College do not appear to archive
them. Those of the early seventies
remained fairly uncontroversial and
therefore avoided censorship,
although nowadays they would
probably raise cries of' 'Sexism!'' due
to being liberally laced with Playboy
and Penthouse cutouts—a trend which
lately appears to have died out.
The publication reached its present
format in 1979 with the introduction
of higher quality paper and a glossy
cover. The end result was polished,
professional, and rejected by the
printers due to the nature of its
contents. 1979 also saw the start of

election of the editor should be
brought forward.
The early Rag Mags had little or no
advertising, justified by their low
production costs, and even with the
introduction of the improved format
publication being banned by a UGM.
The ban was eventually lifted, but not
before momentum had been lost,
leaving a vast pile of unsold Rag
Mags. An attempt by Carl Burgess to
ban the 1985 version failed, despite
the inclusion of Bradford Fire jokes,
and the resulting notoriety gave a
considerable boost to sales country
wide.
The above result has given rise to
two schools of thought. The first
points to the good sales achieved by
a bad reputation, and uses that as
reasoning for an 'anything goes'
attitude. The second school agrees
with the sales point, but adds that a
good, clean Rag Mag ought to sell as
well, and avoids the adverse publicity
to College and Union courted by such
events as the highlighting in the
national press of a recent IC Rag Mag
as an example of racism and sexism
in British universities.
The present publication grew out of

in 1979 little effort was made to
increase this. The aggressive
commercial attitude of this year's
publication is reflected in increased
advertising, and in the possibility that

bookstores to stock it. Half the
printing costs were -covered by
advertising revenue, and for the sake
of quality of production it is hoped
that future editors will continue this
trend.
