The Big Easy
It is unusual for the FELIX office to
be sent four tickets for a press
screening; the immediate conclusion
I came to was that the film must be
dreadful. With this in mind I was
quite pleasantly surprised; the film is
a straightforward tale of police
corruption in New Orleans, and
makes fairly easy watching for a
Saturday night. The plot is a little
thin, and quite a lot of the acting is
coarse, but on the whole it's a lively
film with some nice humerous
touches.
Dennis Quaid (of The Right Stuff
and Enemy Mine) plays the police
lieutenant who followed his father
into the force and has, like all his
friends, been accepting 'protection'
money ever since. He is happy to treat
lightly a series of murders, seemingly
part of a gang war between rival
drugs dealers, but the Assistant DA,
played by Ellen Barkin (of Tender
Mercies and Desert Bloom) is
determined to look more closely and
investigate police involvement.
The film is depressingly
predictable, in that from the first
appearance of Ms Barken, everyone
knows that she and Mr Quaid are
going to end up in bed together. In
fact, it's one of those films where
most of the audience might
concentrate hardest on lusting after
one another of the two stars (well, I
did anyway). One can't help
wondering how many detectives in
New Orleans spend as much time as
Mr Quaid in the weights room, and
I'm sure no Assistant DA has ever
looked anything like Ms Barkin.
The film is hardly the 'sassiest,
sexiest, coolest thriller in years' that
the publicity blurb made it out to be.
but it's a good enough film for an
intellectually relaxing night out.
The Big Easy goes on general
release in September.

Hello
Out There
I'd like to bring to everyone's notice
the existence of Environmental
Society. As some of you may know,
Environmental Society was formed in
the Centre for Environmental
Technology by the postgraduate
students there. During the summer
term, though, most people at Env
Tech do field courses then leave, and
so at this time every year Env Soc
folds up.
It is our aim to keep this society
running through the summer term in
order to have a full program of events
for next year and a stall at Freshers'
Fair. We also intend to run another
Environmental Week following up
this year's highly successful event.
So if you think you care about the
issues that affect the environment
today and want to learn more about
our intentions, please get in touch
soon.
Can I also mention that if anyone is
interested in helping to run Third
World First could they please get in
touch with Penny Bourkes. Physics II.

issues, development, etc., which
should be available shortly on our
shelf in the Haldane Library.
If anyone is looking for 'appropriate'
projects (3rd year, etc) for next year,
we have a number of staff contacts in
different departments who can help.
Please get in touch if you are
interested.
Finally, although we have a
committee for next year, we would
be very please to see anyone who
would like to help with events,
speakers, etc. Again, just drop me a
note if you're interested.

IC lst team beat University of East
Anglia 5-4, to go through to the last
eight in the UAU Championships.
The team, who have not lost a match
all season, seem set to go on and win
the finals. Also, they have reached the
semi-finals, of the London Cup,
without dropping a set. The team's
success, is due to the experience of
various national & international
players, expecially that of the veteran
Ricardo Babamartin.
