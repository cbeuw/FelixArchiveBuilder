Editorial FELIX, Friday J u n e 5th 1 9 8 7 3
Strength in numbers
I should like to draw attention to the
letter from Amnesty International on
page 2. Though they have been
organising letter-writing campaigns
throughout the year, I have not
noticed a great deal of support from
the students as a whole. Even if you
cannot be bothered to vote next
Thursday, try to spare a couple of
minutes to support Amnesty in its
campaign. We can argue for hours
about the relative benefits of the
political parties; there are no grey
areas when we see evidence of racial
discrimination in capital sentencing.
Letters and Opinion
Articles
It has been editorial policy this year,
as in many previous years, not to edit
or cut letters and opinion articles
without discussing any changes with
the author. The reasons for this are
quite simple; I do not wish to run the
risk of distorting anyone's reasoning.
In practical terms, this means that we
have to decide whether to print
material in full, or leave it out
completely, and this approach is not
always very satisfactory when we are
trying to produce a balanced
newspaper. In the remaining issues of
this term, all letters and opinion
articles which FELIX receives may
be sub-edited or cut. Due
consideration will of course, be given
to preserve the meaning of any article.
I hope this will help the College's
favourite bores to resist the temptation
to write six pages when one would
suffice.
End of Term
Only four weeks to go before I'm
unemployed (and unemployable). For
anyone who is interested, I am
planning to bring out two more
issues—next Friday (12th) and Friday
19th. There is a possibility that the
last issue will be delayed until
Wednesday 24th, to fit in with our
usual policy at the end of term, but
the deadline for all copy for this issue
is next Wednesday (10th). I appreciate
that this is well in advance of
publication date, but at the moment
I am hoping to bring out about 36
pages, so everything needs to be done
early.

—The last box ad of all time—
If you think FELIX has begun to look more like
the "FELIX Advertiser" recently, do not despair.
As from next week there will be no more
superfluous box ads in the paper. Please note
that the Small Ads deadline is 1.30pm Monday.
For anything bigger, I will be happy to supply a
copy of our ratecard.
