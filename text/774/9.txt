Brave New World
Whose right and whose choice? Paul Rice examines the contradictions implicit in
Abortion and Embryo Experimentation.
As graduates of Imperial College we
will exert influence on society not
least in those areas related to science.
The creative bounds of scientific
research are being challenged by a
society that feels increasingly
threatened by science's growing
power. For instance, there was
intense media interest and public
debate last summer centred around the
Powel Bill, which proposed to make
embryo experimentation illegal,
resulting in our MPs voting to
produce majorities of over one
hundred in the bill's favour. These
majorities stemmed partly from the
weak evidence supporting the
scientific value of experimentation,
but also from an instinctive distaste
for the arguments of the eugenics
movement, which are an integral part
of the case for human embryo
experimentation. No doubt the
thought of experimental embryos
growing into adult human beings
weighed heavily upon the minds of
MPs.
The implications of the Powcl Bill
for the legal and moral status of the
human foetus, if it had been allowed
enough time to pass on to the statute
book, have not been lost on our more
forceful advocates of abortion. A
leading feminist, writing recently in
the Guardian, pointed out, that,
banning all human embryo
experimentation would be equivalent
to presenting the embryo with a fully
human right to life, and would nullify
the moral force of any law advocating
abortion. In other words it is
contradictory to ban embryo
experimentation whilst preserving the
right to kill the same embryos at much
later stages of development. It is this
conflicting state of affairs that is
producing a reassessment of the 1967
abortion debate which was fought on
three grounds; a woman's claim to
exercise exclusive rights over her own
body; the rights of the human foetus;
the suffering involved in the birth of
(unwanted) children with physical or
mental handicap and in to socially and
psychologically difficult situations. In
the cases involving rape and danger
to the mother's life abortion had been
permitted before the 1967 act.
We have a significant claim upon
the law to respect our bodily integrity.
If abortion was to be made illegal,
then, the right denied would be the
ability of a woman to prematurely end
a natural state of her body (by
removing a foetus from her womb);
a state she shares the responsibility for
initiating except in the case of rape.
This would undoubtedly form a valid
right provided that you could show
that the foetus itself does not warrant
any pre-eminent respect over the
mother's claims.
The foetus does not exhibit many
of our distinctive human attributes,
including the capacity for rational
thought, but they are part of its nature
because it quite naturally attains them
as it develops. The human foetus is
genetically predetermined to live out
and experience a unique human life;
in killing it we are denying it no less
than if we killed any other person,
simply their only opportunity to
experience their life. We award legal
rights in order to protect and publicly
indicate respect for those aspects of
our existence that we value greatly.
Respect for the human body is but one
facet of our respect for human life;
so much so that it is difficult to
perceive how a mother can have a
moral claim over her child's life or
body simply on the grounds of the
rights she claims over her own body.
Yoa cannot without contradiction
claim to be respecting the human
body whilst destroying the human
foetus.
The objection may be raised,
however, that what actually matters
is not abstract objective respect for
human life but the quality of human
life; we cannot expect people to suffer
for an abstract concept. Indeed, the
foetus need not suffer pain and if
killing it is a great moral evil, then,
we should see a correspondingly
severe degree of human suffering
accompanying it. One cannot
correlate these two concepts in such
a crude manner although many people
do. Murder in which no physical and
emotional suffering is involved is still
clearly morally repugnant. However,
to an extent that would have been
impossible in 1967, disturbing
medical evidence of the long term
psychological harm, technically
termed post-abortion syndrome, has
recently surfaced (1) (2). This is
strongly undermining the use of
abortion as a palliative for other social
evils. The case for abortion on the
grounds of humanitarian compassion
is being severely damaged. Those
who want to see an end to abortion
still recognise that much more needs
to be done to support and protect
expectant mothers and mothers with
young children, particularly at work
but also in numerous other areas. It
is difficult to see how these problems
will be faced when the blame for them
can be so easily placed on the mother
with the question; why didn't you
have an abortion?
As the connection between foetal
and adult human life continues to be
reforged, so the concept of abortion
will become increasinly repugnant.
This process is well under way in the
development of ultra-sound scanning,
the probable outlawing of embryo
experimentation, and our increasingly
detailed knowledge of the effects of
the experience of life within the womb
on our later human development.
Nevertheless we can effect the pace
of change in this outlook. As the
general election approaches we will
have an imporant opportunity to
influence the views of our future
legislature. I suggest that we exert our
influence to hasten the process and to
protect the unborn by making our
opinions known, and using our votes
for their future benefit.
