Election fever grips
IC (honest!)
Elections
I got some post this morning, for the first
time in ages. I was almost overwhelmed
with excitement until I noticed the words
'Election Communication' on the top
right-hand comer of the envelope. Well.
SDP propaganda may not be top of my
list of Things I Would Like to Receive
in the Post, but it's quite comforting to
know that my name's on the electoral
roll, at least.
Mind you. it's difficult to take an
election seriously when the propoganda
from all major parties seems to rely
heavily on bad-mouthing the opposition;
hardly a positive approach. Perhaps it's
because there is really less difference
between them than they'd like us to
think?
During one of our long, which-way-
to-vote discussions in the office, I came
to a sad conclusion. Given that the party
I'd really like to vote for doesn't exist
(and that the nearest thing to it stands
zero chance under the current voting
system); recognising that my preferred
major party stands no chance in this
particular constituency—I may well end
up voting for a third choice. What a
wonderful system it is!
This, however, is an aside. The point
of this spiel is quite simple. Everyone
who lives in College accommodation is
registered, and most of the rest of you
should be, too. Whatever the faults of
the electoral system you owe it to
yourself to find out the facts and get out
there and vote next Thursday.
Kensington, for example, is a marginal
constituency; your vote will really count.
So get out there and use your vote; use
it wisely. Let's just hope that this
election isn't as depressing as the last
one.
And Now...
I'm now so exhausted after writing all
that without mentioning the parties by
name that I'm not going to attempt to
say anything useful. I was going to finish
with a small poem but apparently it's too
politically biased for Dave to print. So
here is something completely different.
Q. What runs round Paris at midday
wrapped in a plastic bag?
A. The Lunchpack of Notre-Dame.
Well you can't get much worse than
that. Have a nice week.
Love, Christine.
Gay/Lesbian update
Because, like everyone else, I am in the
middle of exams at the moment I haven't
much time to write this week. I'd just
like to remind you all that IC Gay Okay
will continue to meet on Wednesday
until the end of term, and that at the start
of next term we will start off with a stall
on Freshers' Fair—all ideas will be
appreciated. Thanks to everyone who
turned up: keep 'em coming!

Todays the day the Teddy bears
have their picnic
FELIX scores again. On our usual beat
to cover the fact behind the fiction, we
probed. What is this 'First Fantastic
Family Fair' affair?
The low-down. Queen's Lawn is in for
a shock. Just everybody will descend on
it: 8 days old to 80; clerks; chefs;
cashiers; cleaners; students; sparks;
secretaries; sub-wardens; messengers;
PGs; PAs; professors...you name it,
along with Aunt Flo, Grandpa and Baby
Jane.
Reputed to be mingling with these
honest families will be somewhat
dubious jazz musicians, artists, rafflers,
magicians, jugglers, clowns, even
engineers.
Dignity is under serious threat. The
Rector is fiddling for musical chairs.
The College Secretary and the Pro
Rector in feather boas and floppy hats
will lead the Father's Day Relay Race.
Informed sources say they may be
upstaged by infants in the Great Obstacle
Crawl or the Sponsored Toddle.
An antique microscope will be
auctioned, home-made chocolate cakes
on offer, as are amazing clothes, toys
and a host of unclaimed memorabilia.
Rumour has it that vintage cars will be
available.
Still hush-hush is the contents of dozens
of stalls. Department Superintendents
behind closed doors W2 in Beit Quad
may reveal all next Tuesday. The main
programme is still a secret but spies tell
us that DramSoc, OpSoc, STOIC, IC
Radio, Dixieland and accordians are
vying for place.
What we can disclose is that a popcorn
machine has been engaged, special sugar
ice cream cones ordered from America;
a punch and other brews under
deliberation.
FELIX, as always, will be tireless in
the quest for the latest scandal as the
great event draws closer. The big
question now—Who will be the MC?
Predictions on a postcard by Wednesday
noon (for a preview of the brew) please.
Sunday June 21st is the Day; 4-7pm the
Time. Ring 3004 or see your
Superintendent for tickets: Your
invitation to make history.
Roll up! Roll up! for
THE VERY FIRST
Family Fair 8 7
Pop corn, punch, Jazz, jugglers, Stalls,
side shows, Clowns, competitions
(including "pin the tail on Michael
Arthur")
