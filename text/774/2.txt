Death penalty bias
Louisiana Injustice
There has been a sudden and
worrying upsurge in the number of
executions in the United States.
Several States have-, now resumed
executions, after waiting for the
landmark Supreme Court ruling on
racial discrimination in the case of
McCleskey vs Kemp. Louisiana
intends to put to death six prisoners
between June 7th and 18th, despite
evidence of racial bias in the
application of the death penalty.
McCleskey vs Kemp
Warren McCleskey appealed to the
US Supreme Court against his death
sentence in Georgia on the strength
of evidence which showed that blacks
were far more likely than whites to
get the death penalty for an equivalent
offence. The evidence consisted of an
extensive study by Professor David
Baldus of Iowa State University in
which he examined the effects of race
on capital sentencing in more than
2000 homicide cases in the period
1973-79. He found that defendants
convicted of killing white victims
were eleven times more likely to get
the death sentence than killers of
blacks.
The Supreme Court Decision
Despite this finding, the Supreme
Court ruled with a narrow majority
(5-4) that the defendant would have
had to prove a discriminatory intent
on the part of the court that originally
convicted him—an exceptionally
tough burden of proof. Amazingly the
Supreme Court did not dispute the
findings of Baldus' study and referred
them as a matter of interest to the
State's law-making bodies. The four
judges who dissented from the
majority decision were stunned that
the clear 'risk' of racial bias in
McCleskey's case was not regarded
as a relevant factor. Justice Brennan
wrote "the risk that race influenced
McCleskey's sentence is intolerable,
by any standards".
Amnesty's Concern
Since there are also reports of racial
discrimination in Louisiana, Amnesty
International is making strenuous
efforts to appeal for clemency in the
cases of the six prisoners there.
Amnesty believes, and rightly, that
the process of execution cannot be
permitted to continue whilst there is
a significant risk that sentences are not
being applied fairly. In any case
Amnesty is totally opposed to the
death penalty as a cruel, degrading
and inappropriate punishment.
What You Can Do
The gravity of the situation in
Louisiana calls for swift, effective
action. You can easily participate in
that action by writing to the Governor
of Louisiana. Simply write a brief,
courteous letter expressing your
concern at the imminent executions of
the six prisoners. It doesn't have to
be very long at all—a couple of lines
will do. The important thing is that
the authorities should be inundated
with letters of concern. Amnesty has
shown time and time again how
effective letters can be; so please,
make the little effort that is
required—even if you do have exams.

£22.10 per week
Dear David,
Just a quick note to highlight the
impending destitution which will fall
upon us in the event of a Conservative
majority on June 11th. There now
follows a bit of number crunching.
The maintenance grant is at present
£2236.
Next year we will receive a 4%
increase, "in line with inflation",
giving us £2325.44. For our 39 week
year, we can allocate £59.60 per
week.
The average private
accommodation, within 45 mins
walking distance of College, inclusive
of rates, costs about £37.50 per week,
per person.
If the bill is deployed to prevent
students from being entitled to rent
rebate, from the 1st Sept, then we will
be left with £22.10 per week.
That is £22.10 per week to feed,
clothe and water ourselves; let alone
buy books and stationery or even
going out (God forbid!!). Maybe, in
the event of poll tax, or even
landlords wiseing up to the fact that
students cannot afford to live in their
expensive slums anymore, there could
be a reduction in the rent. This does
seem like a good ploy to make us
desire student loans, or use our
parents as crutches.
Support Tactical Voting '87 on
June 11th.

Clements' last letter
Dear Dave,
Having read this last issue of RCS
Broadsheet (Vol 19 Issue 11) I feel
it necessary to comment on many of
the factual errors contained within it,
especially those concerning the RCS
Constitutions Review Committee
which I have been chairing. The
presence of the numerous errors quite
clearly demonstrates that whoever
wrote the article (it was unfortunately
anonymous) has made no attempt
whatsoever to find out the real facts,
but is prepared to write an article
based on his own prejudices and
guesswork.
To start with the front page:
"Round 2 of the Great Constitutional
Debate begins June 12th". This is
total rubbish, since the Review
Committee has to report back to Gen
Comm before anything goes to a
UGM. The next Gen Comm is on
June 15th, and the earliest UGM to
which changes can be put will be the
second of next term, since no serious
business can be conducted at the
Freshers' UGM.
Next, the description of the RCS
Constitution as an "unwieldy
monster''. If that is true of it scant 16
pages I would like to know the
authors's opinion of this multi-volume
epic of the ICU constitution.
The proposed addition of a
requirement that the president should
have completed 2 years in RCS
indeed would not affect Clare, next
year's president. However, the
suggestion that it would have
prevented Simon, this year's
president, being elected is entirely
false, or hadn't the author noted that
Simon is a 3rd year physicist who will
be leaving at the end of this year?
The position of UGM and Gen
Comm chairman, a proposed new
officer post, has not in fact been
approved by the committee. We
discussed this at great length, and,
unlike all other changes, failed to
come to a unanimous conclusion. We
thought, though, that wider discussion
was warranted and so will suggest this
to Joint Gen Comm. The matter of a
pot for this post also demonstrates the
author's lack of understanding. No
post in RCS, or ICU even, is awarded
a pot until it has proved its usefulness
and durability by functioning for at
least 3 years, and then the award is
only at the discretion of Joint Gen
Comm. As far as the holder of the
post is concerned this would be
decided by Gen Comm, should the
post be approved. Any changes to the
RCS constitution, I would like to add,
have to be approved by a % majority
at 2 separate UGMs, so none of these
changes will get through without
popular approval.
Elsewhere in Broadsheet it is
suggested that Simon Banton
graduated with a 3rd from Physics 3
years ago. Wrong again, as just about
anyone will tell you, he got a pass and
graduated 2 years ago.
Finally I would like to make some
general comments about Clare's
editorial. How she can call the cover
of Not Broadsheet offensive when she
herself published the not only
offensive but dangerous AIDS article
by Julian Moore (Vol 19 Issue 8) is
beyond me. Also, I would like to ask
her how she expects to have an
effective working relationship with
Steph Snell and Dave Williams (next
year's HJT) when she subjects them
to vicious personal attacks. I find the
lack of understanding of human
nature revealed by this to be among
the best reasons I have seen for
suggesting that RCS presidents should
be 3rd years. Research in FELIX and
Broadsheet archives has shown that
never before has there been a 2nd year
president.
It has, however, been suggested
that the editorial in question was not
actually written by Clare. The
signature at the bottom certainly bears
more of a resemblance to Dave
Smedley's earlier in the issue than it
does to Clare's normal signature.
Should this be the case I would
apologise unreservedly for the
comments in the above paragraph,
and would suggest that the person
responsible for such an irresponsible
damaging impersonation never be
allowed to touch Broadsheet again.
Many thanks for the time you've
spent reading this.
Yours,
Dave Clemments
Liquid Assets
Dear Dave,
This is not a letter about gays.
Just before I leave this place, I'd
like to ask next year's DP and FELIX
Editor, through your exalted
columns, what they plan to do with
the Union assets, ie the Union Bar,
Snackbar, and Bookshop/Sportshop.-
I ask those two because, first, the
DP is responsible for the running of
those assets, and, second, the FELIX
Editor is responsible for how they are
publicised/described. I'd like to see
their answers in print to compare
them and for the record.
With these days of indeterminate
student attitude towards the Union
(and vice-versa perhaps), and
decreasing real money budgets, it
would seem a shame to waste those
assets through insufficient thought
and communication, or non-
constructive criticism.
Yours interestedly,
David Pearce, Mining IV
PS. I do hope that you can find
room for this little request amongst
your frightfully important FELIX
news.
