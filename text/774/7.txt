Derelict and Abandoned Vehicles
Several vehicles appear to have been abandoned on
the campus. This prevents vehicle users from
parking.
In future, any vehicle abandoned on College
premises will be removed after a period of two
weeks from when a notice of intention has been
attached to the vehicle by the traffic warden.
If the owners of the following vehicles have not
removed the vehicle, or contacted the security
officer, within two weeks, the vehicles will be
removed.
