Human
Rights
A motion supporting a London-wide
University Human Rights Week was
passed at the General Union Council
(GUC) of the University of London
Union (ULU) last Tuesday. The
motion was proposed jointly by
Imperial College and University
College London, and mandates the
GUC executive to form a special
committee, comprising
representatives of the executive,
Amnesty International, and other
human rights organisations to
organise the event. The week will
include a letter writing campaign as
well as other events.
A amendment, put in by the
London School of Economics, that
ULU should commit itself to funding
the week was defeated with the
argument that U L U should
concentrate on specific student issues,
like the successful '3Rs' campaign to
avert a 50% cut in ULU funding this
year.
Jane Cannon, outgoing U L U
President, announced that the main
ULU campaign next year would be
about the issue of student facilities in
the University; for example, total
spending on sporting facilities is 40%
less in London that the national
average.
Sid Jones has been appointed
Electrical Supervisor Residences and
will report to Peter Hallworth. Sid is
not a new boy! He joined the College
as a Botany lab assistant on leaving
school in 1944, and apart from a
break of two years in the Royal Air
Force has worked on the campus
throughout his career. He is a popular
member of the Maintenance Services
staff and is very active in the section's

demonstration organised by the
Islamic Students Association in
Europe, to mark the day of Quds.
Some 500 people marched from
Speakers Corner to Prince Consort

the opposed Palestinian muslims".

Sid has been involved in the
upgrading of the College electrical

banners were much in evidence, and
an effigy of Ronald Reagan was
paraded before the crowds assembled
outside the Royal College of Music.
A heavy police presence including a
cordon in front of the Iraqi Embassy
accompanied the demonstration,
which had been heavily publicised at
Islamic prayer meetings at Imperial.
Motorists
to face
£25 fee
Students and staff who use the
College parking places may be faced
with an annual charge of £25 as from
next autumn. Parking and Traffic
committee have been discussing plans
to raise money from the College's
parking spaces, including raised daily
charges for public parking, as well as
an annual fee for College users.
Though the new charges have been
minuted as a directive from the
College Finance and Executive
Committee, there is some dispute as
to whether there have been any
definite instructions. For the moment,
the matter has been passed back to the
Rector's Policy Committee.
Representatives of the Trade
Unions on campus are understood to
be unhappy about the proposal for a
charge for College members.
Questions
on AIDS
Members of Imperial College will be
able to put questions to an
international panel of experts on
AIDS tonight. To mark the close of
the International AIDS conference in
Washington, a live teleconference is
being transmitted by satellite to six
centres in Europe, including London,
where invited medical audiences at
Imperial, Kings, University and
Royal Holloway and Bedford
Colleges will be able to take part in
the debate. STOIC will be relaying
the broadcast around the College sets,
and members of the College may
phone in questions on Internal 3949.
The programme will be shown
between 7.30pm and 9.30pm (British
Summer Time). The first hour of the
programme will be an open discussion
between the panel of experts in
Washington, during which the
questions will be gathered at each of
the European centres; these Will then
be presented to the panel in the second
half of the transmission.
Printing
dispute
settled
The dispute between the Imperial
College Union and Hamilton Press
has been settled. The Union has
refused to pay for 9500 copies of the
Alternative Prospectus which were
delivered to the Union but which were
substandard. Instead of £1885, the
sum on the original invoice, the
Union will now be paying £1600 for
the AP including a reprint of 2000
copies. The extra copies should be
delivered within the next week.
