Dear Sir,
On the 2nd January I wrote
to the E d i t o r concerning the
faults in this year's F E L I X .
For publication purposes I have
edited this letter down to some-
thing l i k e a quarter of its
original s i z e ; thus a lot of
suggestions made here, remain
unjustified. A L L these sug-
gestions have been justified in
the original letter. In the
meanwhile Mr. Williams has
implemented a few of my
suggestions, resulting in a
better i s s u e of F E L I X (No.373).
I would a l s o l i k e to point out
that I H A V E O N L Y C R I T I C I S E D
F E L I X IN A R E A S W H E R E I
C O U L D D O B E T T E R than the
present Editor, given the same
amount of time that he has had
on the job.
In the Christmas issue of
F E L I X the E d i t o r asked readers
to bemore open i n their c r i t i c i s m
of F E L I X . A s a senior member
of the Sennet staff, I can see
more easily than others the
faults in this y e a r ' s F E L I X .
My first recommendations
concern advertising. In the
Christmas i s s u e , F E L I X ad-
vertised for an A d v e r t i s i n g
Manager, 'No experience
necessary'. The last phrase
characterises Mike W i l l i a m s '
ignorance and neglectful
attitude towards advertising.
A beginner would take time to
learn advertising methods,
consequently being of little use
to F E L I X before October. My
proposal, though, i s that A N Y
M O V E T O W A R D S M A K I N G
F E L I X S E L F - S U P P O R T I N G
(without lowering editorial
standards) S H O U L D B E
W E L C O M E D . A n y additional
money is welcome income to a
union whoose college grant is
l i k e l y to be cut this year.
I b e l i e v e that the E d i t o r
should be A d v e r t i s i n g Manager.
In order to achieve self-
financing, a l l F E L I X staff
would be involved in advertising.
A l l staff (barring the Editor),
would be offered a 10% C O M -
MISSION O N A L L T H E
A D V E R T S T H E Y B O O K .
My proposals are based on
my experience as Sennet's
A s s i s t a n t Advertising Manager.
I b e l i e v e 1 am the best candidate
for the job of F E L I X A d v e r t i s i n g

This week's page three girl
is Anne Pickard who comes
from Winchester and is currently
pursuing academic studies in
Civ. Eng. 2. She is also the
floor rep for Beit Hall and last
Tuesday was elected Bo Belle
at the Guilds Union meeting.
Her comment afterwards was,
'It came completely as a
surprise'. She was also totally
unprepared for a ceremonial
splash in the swimming pool.

RAG WAKE
IS HERE
R A G W E E K ' S gone, the last F E L I X carried reports from most
)f the events, and a l l that remains is the memory â€” A h h ! Anyway,
town to business.
F i r s t l y , next year's Rag (yes, forward planning folks); if
anyone has any ideas about improving Rag Week (and let's face it,
it could do with improving)
don't keep them to yourself,
but let your C C U V P know,
preferably in writing. Then he
can pass your gem's onto me
and something can get done.
If anyone is interested in
actively preparing for
year, see me or your V P
w e ' l l need a new co-ordinator
soon, and we need an assistant
Rag Mag Editor now.
Secondly, this year's Rag,
and the events not covered by
F E L I X , one way or another.
The Rag and Drag Competition
was probably the best event in
Rag Week, c l o s e l y pressed by
Morphy Day. If you went, I
hope you had a good time -
and if you lost either a large
coat (herringbone pattern) or a
pair of black patent-leather
woman's shoes, or both, let me
know and I can return them.
The Chariot Race was a M i n e s -
dominated event, with R C S and
G u i l d s producing little in the
way of quality or quantity
(Mech. Eng. I excepted). The
race was somewhat eclipsed by
the magnificent collection of
R C S that day, and con-
gratulations to a l l those
concerned in that effort. The
pub crawl was fiercely fought
out between two couples, and
to avoid argument, you can
decide for yourselves who won.
Bob Longman (Min. Tech I)
drank a staggering 31 vodkas,
and his partner Helen Natrass
(Geo. II) 18 scotches and 2
vodkas. Their chief r i v a l s ,
Gary Brittain (Min. II) and
Lorna Hawthorne (IF would
you believe) drank 2 lagers
and 23 vodkas, and 27 martinis
respectively. D e c i d e who you
think won, write your answer on
a plain clothes policeman, and
eat it. Time-wise, the winners
were undoubtedly Keith Ahlers
(Chem. E n g . II) and J a n i c e
Ford (Chem. E n g . II) who did
the circuit of nine pubs in
55 minutes and consumed
7 w h i s k e y s , 7 pints of bitter,
2 pints of guinness, 5 dubonnets,
3 advocaats and got very i l l in
the evening's frivolities.
Morphy Day and Smoking
Concert have been commented
on in a previous edition and
require no further elaboration.
The IF V i c a r s and Tarts Party
went w e l l , and with a little
more support could become,
dare one say it, a real h e l l -
raising event (sorry!). F i n a l l y ,
the B a r - B - Q . T h i s was a new
event for Rag, and I must
apologise for the lack of meat,
next If you came, you were possibly
a s disgruntled as I was when
what looked like two corgis on
a stick appeared instead of a
cow. However, this year has
shown that the interest is there,
and next year we w i l l have
learnt from our mistakes.
In c o n c l u s i o n , may I thank
everyone who helped out in
Rag Week; many people helped,
but particular thanks go from
me to Dave, Pat, Martin and
S t e l l a . A l s o many thanks to
Kieth, Garden H a l l (Bob, P a u l ,
Howard, et a I,), S C A B , R C C ,
A l a n Jones, F l o s and Rent-a-
Crowd.
