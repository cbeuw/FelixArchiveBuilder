T r e v o r P h i l l i p s
Y E S , IT is true. I am s t i l l a l i v e , even
if no literary gems have been flowing
from my illustrious pen (it's a Christmas
present) in the last few w e e k s . It is
unfortunate, and partly my own fault,
that the Union has not used its news-
paper to the fullest advantage in the
past term. In this term, perhaps, with the
aid of a l l concerned, we c a n be more
effective in the crucial field of dialogue
with the Union membership. My own
contribution w i l l be to promise a P r e c i -
p i c e every week. Perhaps, in this way,
I c a n communicate the present concerns
of the Union bureaucracy/leadership.
A s with every other section of the
population, the first concern of the mass
of students today is the effect of the
economic situation on our pockets and
our conditions of work. We have cam-
paigned for something like ten terms on
the question of student grants. We have
graduated from a position of simply
c a l l i n g for higher rates, to a more
sophisticated (and rather more publicly
acceptable) campaign for changes in the
giants system, to eliminate the burden
of means tests on our parents and
spouses, and for an end to discretionary
awards and other anomalies; in short, a
fair grant for a l l students. T h i s is a
reasonable demand.
However, in the past six months, in
the wake of the £250 million education
budget cut, instigated by the Tory party
and maintained by the unspeakable Reg
Prentice, we have seen a rapidly
deteriorating financial situation in the
colleges, resulting in the 2% cuts at IC
last term. This is a much more serious
question than the rate of grant, (though
inextricably linked to it). The treatment
.at higher education by successive
governments threatens the very existence
of sections of higher education.
In our own area, we can already point
to the imminent closure of one c o l l e g e of
education, Maria Assumpta, with w h i c h
we have had excellent s o c i a l relations
(marfy of us survived on MA d i s c o s ) . A'1
,
over the country closures and mergers <
are occuring; some are commendable.
Others are being implemented simply to
same money, but the quality of education
in those c o l l e g e s in being destroyed.
Of course, th« privileged sector, td,
which we belong, is not going to go
under. It is those sectors which are
heavily relied upon by less privileged
and less influential members of the
community, that are bearing the brunt of
the attack. Adult education, technical
colleges, the further education sector,
all essentially geared to working-class
students, and in the vast majority of
cases, their only realistic channel to
higher education, will be the first to go
under. The universities, still populated
by the children of the middle class to the
extent of some 72%, (statistics courtesy
of the DES) will survive.
The grants system itself is i n -
extricably linked to the c u t s . Holding
down student grants w h i l s t forcing
c o l l e g e s to raise refectory prices and
rents is the Government's second front.
T h i s is the hidden cut in expenditure.
Who suffers? The student, of course. It
i s , again, working-class sections of
higher education who get it in the n e c k -
the students on discretionary awards.
It was worthwhile reading K a t i e
M c K i n n o n ' s 'IF Only' on the injustice of
discretionary awards; w h i l s t not agreeing
with a l l she wrote, it is absolutely
correct that students on discretionary
awards are easi ly the worst off.
However, in terms of both cuts and
grants, privileged though we may be, we
are not getting away lightly. F i n a n c i a l
cuts in departments have meant that
lecturing posts are being left vacant,
w h i c h means the l o s s of courses here
and there. T e c h n i c i a n s ' posts unfilled
mean fewer practicals and less diversity
in experimental work. There is less
demonstrating work for postgraduates to
do, and l e s s expensive material for
research students to use. That much-
vaunted 'quality of education' is
beginning to fall, with overworked and
underpaid staff, and less money for aids
to teaching.
The threat of price r i s e s in refectories
is imminent in the next few weeks,
because of the self-financing r u l e s .
Grants are not l i k e l y to follow this trend;
there is s t i l l a means test to contend
w i t h . A s the economic c r i s i s hits parents
harder, fewer w i l l be able to meet the
parental contribution to the grant. The
value of the grant itself is being eroded
at the staggering rate of over £7.90 per
month (figure for last November from the
N U S Educational and Welfare Department).
The spouses' contribution has hit many
married students very hard. The ludicrous
justification for continued discrimination
against married women (that it is primarily
the husband's responsibility to keep up
the household and wife; no such con-
sideration_applies in reverse) w i l l not'
satisfy any woman affected by it.
It is absolutely claar that a campaign
which attacks both the grants system,
and the vicious cuts in education-
spending must be mounted. This has,
correctly, been called for by last term's
NUS Conference in Margate. The Week of
A c t i o n will be the final week of February,
culminating in a National Demonstration
on February 28th.
It is not a time for cynicism. The
facts are there for anyone to see. Anyone
interested in fighting against the det-
erioration of the education system, and
that includes primary and secondary
education, will form a common cause
with us in the Grants Campaign. Anyone
who is not, either doesn't really belong
here, or has failed to realise how
important a decent education has been
to him.
It is interesting to see that the
National Front is now '700% racialist' in
the words of their spokesman, by refusing
membership to people of mixed race and
non-European ancestry. It is clear that
the 'Hitler was right' brigade is in the
ascendancy (strangely enough" J e w s are
not yet excluded), i am only s l i g h t l y
disappointed that I cannot j o i n .
Those people who slated me for being
'unfair' to a 'respectable' organisation
like the N F — how are they to be
defended now? Presumably if one voted
for them in an election, one would be
voting for a '700% racialist' e s t a b l i s h -
m e n t — u n i v e r s i t i e s , parliament, judiciary
and so on. No-one is going to 'ban' them.
I believe that this sort of organised
racism and fascism is unlawful; and I
hope that they are prosecuted.
Those of you who saw a reference to
my close personal friendship with a dear
old lady living on the Mall in last week's
Sennet, don't be misled. There is no
truth in the rumour. I don't even like
champagne.
