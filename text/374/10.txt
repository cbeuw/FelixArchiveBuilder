James W i l k i n s o n
Stardust — Hay Connolly
THIS IS T H E B O O K of the film sequel
to the original film 'That'll Be the Day'.
T h o s e of you who Saw 'That'll Be The
Day' w i l l remember it chronicled the
adventures of J i m Maclaine from his
chucking in school and dropping out, to
dropping back i n , getting married and
dropping back out again. In the middle he
meets and makes friends with Mfke
Mennery who works on a fairground.
When 'Stardust' opens it is 1963, and
Jim has grown h i s hair, grown up and
become a singer with a rock and roll
band c a l l e d the Stray C a t s . Performing to

BOOKS
bored audiences in seedy c l u b s , they
live on dreams of becoming as famous as
the Beatles or the R o l l i n g Stones.
A combination of luck, ruthlessness
and a lot of hard hustling on the part of
M i k e Mennery, who J i m brings in as the
group's road manager, makes the Stray
Cats rock and roll superstars. However,
just when they have achieved their dream,
it starts to go sour.
T h i s book may not be a masterpiece of
E n g l i s h Literature, but it seems to me that
i t ' s honest about the way things were and,
I suppose, s t i l l are. Definately an
interesting book!

Mike McGear - McGear (Polydor).
F l i c k i n g down the track listings shows
an opener of apparent taste, M r . F ' s 'Sea
Breezes', which could be quite interesting.
There's a dramatic launch, decapitated
vocals et-all, but the s t y l e ' s not there.
The track eventually dies into raggae and
the c l a s s i c s (shame). The intention of the
album seems to be for P a u l McCartney to
lend bruv Mike McGear a helping hand at
replenishing the Piggy Bank by writing
nine of the ten a v a i l a b l e diffies, producing
the v i n y l , and going for the hatrick by
throwing in the wife or synthesizer. Mind
you, they end up sounding like a set of
half-hearted studio demo tapes, complete
with funny noises. The beat is at best
rudimentary (courtesy Gerry Conway!?).
Some light breaks through the beer
fumes in the form of the single 'Leave It' —
an eminently catchy 3 minutes, but then
it's back to the monkeys-and-children-
only business and a l l the fooling around
in the world won't d i s g u i s e the mediocrity
of the venture. It's a l l been done better a
million times before, Miguel!. Quite com-
parable to, say, L i t t l e Jimmy Osmosis
sings Paul Rodgers.
Side two lifts and separates for a
while, providing straight, uncomplicated
pop tunes mooged-about by the Lovely
Linda — maybe the unaccepted remnants
from the 'Band on the Run' stockpile of
tunes (business is b u s i n e s s , already).
It's a well-produced d i s c but undemanding
of both listener and performer and as such
lacks any kind of immediacy or spark.
If Paul McCartney could do to a l c o h o l i c
beverages what he is evidently capable of,
and admirably suited to, with regards
popular music (i.e. d i s t i l l every essence
and bouquet available into one e a s i l y
palatable product) he wouldn't need to
make another record and the Scots would
start swimming in their water instead of
bottling it. B a s i c a l l y an essay in
Fraternity.
The Glums (BBC)
The B B C strikes in glorious mono with
comedy from the 12th century, when humour
was obviously something vastly different
from the modern concept - no subtlety,
inuendo, or even a little parody — the
radio audience must have been some really
erudite molluscs to latch onto this stuff.
The album appears »to come from some'
B B C radio show titled imaginatively 'The
Glums', featuring D i c k Bentley, June
Whitfield, and Jimmy ' l-was-born-with-
these-whiskers-you-know' Edwards. Yet
another sign of i t ' s age is the expertly
canned laughter. I mean nothing nowadays
is,expertly done.
Could provide some neat openings for
aural sado-masochists.

Slade: Slade in Flame (Polydor)
Y E T A N O T H E R undoubted smasheroo
hit for Slade. T h i s album is the original
soundtrack from the forthcoming film
'Flame' in which the band makes its
acting debut; a s far as the film is con-
cerned, it couldn't have asked for better
pre-publicity. Considering that Slade's
last album Old, New, Borrowed and Blue
grabbed a gold d i s c before its official
release date then clearly the film producer,
the record company and, inevitably so, the
book publisher are out to make pots and
pots of £££'s from this highly commercial
enterprise.
A l l the tracks, with one exception, are
what one has come to expect from Slade:
raunchy, kick-'em-in-the-guts type rock.
'Lay It Down' and 'So Far So Good' are
definitely reminiscent of the Beatles
around '64-'65.
The one exception in the whole album
is the very first cut, 'How Does It Feel?'
which, to my mind, is the best that they
have ever produced. It possesses a con-
fident air of m u s i c a l maturity which
illustrates the fact that the band is
capable of more than just thrashing around
under the a u s p i c e s of their 'NOIZ B O I Z '
tag.
Family: Best of Family (Reprise).
T R A G E D Y undoubtedly struck the
world of B r i t i s h Pop when Family decided
to break-up in October 1973 for, in con-
trast to some of their p l a s t i c i z e d , money-
grabbing contemporaries, they were one of
the few groups who were always searching
for new ideas. It is an undeniable fact
that no two tracks, from this album at
least, are even remotely alike as regards
lyrics, melody and presentation. T h i s
compendium, then, serves as a tribute to
their sheer innovative prowess.
The cuts span the last five of the
band's seven years' existence. Their four
major singles - 'No' Mule's Fool' (1969),
'The Weaver's Answer' (1970), 'In MyOwn
Time' (1971), and 'Burlesque' (1972) -
are naturally included together with their
all-time c l a s s i c 'My Friend the Sun',
which, with its lyrical strength and
delicate harmony never ceases to amaze
me.
This album w i l l appeal to anyone
interested in serious rock (as opposed to
the 'hard' type) and a l s o to supporters
of Leicester C i t y F C , in whose colours
some of the band appear on the sleeve.
