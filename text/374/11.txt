FELIX
LEO SAYER IN CONCERT
L E O S A Y E R ' S concert last Saturday
was certainly exceptional in terms of
entertainment value, while at the same
time being a display of tremendous musical
a b i l i t y .
The programme was initiated with his
hit song 'Just a Boy' and immediately had
the audience under his s p e l l . He then
proceeded to show us his versatility by
s i n g i n g songs from the 'Just a Boy' and
'Silver Bird' albums.
BOUNDLESS ENERGY
7 want to see some
Light' had the audience cheering and
clapping, as Mr.Sayer, small but with
boundless energy, bounced to and fro
across the stage .with the speed of a ping
pong ball but having infinitely more grace
and s e n s e of rhythm.
GEMS
7fs my Life'; 'The
Bells of St. Mary's'; 'Train' and 'Another
Time' were a l l gems in themselves. A l l
the while he was singing he was shaking
R i z Shakir
hands with
remarks.
people, and exchanging entertainment.
COMEDIAN'
He is -rro mean comedian; his s e n s e of
humour is indeed exceptional t p r ' a
m u s i c i a n ; and his impersonation's '61
Michael Crawford of 'Some Mothers Do
Have 'Em' lame are so good that Mike"
Yarwood would be proud of them; Judging
from the laughter and applause, most of
the people at the concert would agree with
me. : ,, '• -:
PROFESSIONAL
L e o Sayer is a reaJ/professional in
every sense of the word. He undoubtedly
enjoys being on the stage and likes to see
everyone else enjoying themselves with
him acting as the catalyst. •: .
Among the s o n g s 5
from 'Silver Bird'
were 'One Man Band', 'I Can Dance' (part
of w h i c h he repeated on request from the
audience). He concluded the concert with
'/ won't Let the Show Go On' which was a
befitting c o n c l u s i o n to a great hour of
'MOST ENJOYABLE'
When % asked; Mr. Sayer to comment on
the concert, 'One of the most enjoyable
concerts I've ever had' came the reply.
He asked me to pass on h i s thanks to a l l
the students at IC; the people responsible
for organising the concert and 'most of all
the audience'.
I would l i k e to pass on a personal
thanks and congratulations for the pro-
fessional handling of things and a l s o for
providing us with a good supporting group
as w e l l as an exceptional concert. Well
done Malcolm and the E n t s Committee.

They said it c o u l d never
happen. N o one man c o u l d
p o s s i b l y play two games so
w e l l , but one man has and that
man is B . P a n t s , the captain of
I C Rugby. F i n d i n g the weather
conditions incompatible with
grass-court games he turned to
asphalt and by a piece of
incredible diplomacy managed to
arrange a netball match against
ICWA.
A n d so it was that on a damp
Sunday afternoon seven I C
Rugby men and seven ICWA
N e t b a l l women arrived at the
Union. T h e venue for this
sporting showpiece was the
L i n s t e a d H a l l ground and the
IC team chose to change in the
h a l l i t s e l f for convenience.
After a five minute warm-up i n
room 213, B . P a n t s led out the
Rugby team onto the court to
find the opposition already out—
a mean bunch to be sure. L e d
by Freda Jones they included in
the side no less a player than
F r e d a 'I scored 40 goals i n one
match' T e l l e m . The other five
players were F r e d a H a r r i s ,
F r e d a Barter, Freda J o , F r e d a
Betteee, and F r e d a J o n e s '
friend, F r e d a . F a c e d with such
notorious opposition Frank
P a n t s had assembled a team of
h i s toughest men, Frank Sutton,
Frank Beddoes, Frank R o b i n s ,
Frank L i p s c o m b e , Frank
Shakesheff, and even Frank
H u g h e s !
The match was refereed by
the ladies team s i n c e they were
the only ones who knew the
rules except Frank P a n t s (who
was to play so w e l l ) of course.
P a n t s decided to play w e l l
down wind for the first quarter
(a shrewd move indeed) and the
game was under way. ICWA
started with an orthodox for-
mation with F r e d a T e l l e m as
goalshooter. Frank Sutton was
ordered to mark her and it was
soon clear that this would be a
bruising encounter. Hughes and
L i p s c o m b e led the I C attack
and as the game flowed from end
to end there were many scoring
chances for either side. Need-
l e s s to say these were w e l l
taken by F r e d a T e l l e m and
squandered by the inept M and
L — clearly the b a l l should
have been smaller or the net
bigger. Pants was generalling
the midfield w e l l but even he
could not compensate for the
lack of s k i l l up front. F r e d a
was everywhere, shadowed
c l o s e l y by Frank. The end of
the.first quarter c a m e w i t h ICWA
. in the lead. P a n t s ' team were
on the rack. There would have!
to be changes. F r a n k reverted;
to goal defence leaving Frank
free to move to wing attack.
T h i s d i s p l a c e d Frank who was
accomodated by switching Frank
to goalshooter from w i n ^
defence and putting Frank at
wing attack. T h i s left F r a n k
who was told to take F r a n k ' s
old position at w i n g defence.
P a n t s was unchanged. The
ICWA team a l s o made changes.
The second quarter started.
The new look I C team shaped
up w e l l Frank F r o g was slightly
more s u c c e s s f u l in attack
(which was not saying much).
C l o s e marking p e r s i s t e d ,
L i p s c o m b e ' treading a l l over
Betteee whom he claimed he
could not see. H a l f time came
with ICWA s t i l l in front. It was
now that master tactician Frank
Hughes stepped forward and
suggested that the I C team
should employ a man to man
marking technique — what a
revelation. Inspired by this
radical thinking there was
another suggestion that the b a l l
should be put thro' the net.
C l e a r l y things were going to be
different i n the second half.
M S F went to goalshooter, and
the game was underway. The I C
team employing theirnew tactics
slowly narrowed the gap. Pants
tave a virtuso performance,
istributing the ball to left and
right with great dexterity. Frank
Beddoes made some blustering
right wing runs despite c l o s e
attention from J o and from h i s
crosses M S F was able to slot
in the goals. F r e d a was worried.
She ordered muscle t a c t i c s and
in the face of this p h y s i c a l
a s s a u l t P a n t s ' team began to
crack, although he himself
continued to play w e l l .
B y now a large crowd had
gathered for the final e x c i t i n g
quarter. Ken Weale and his dog
Frank (?) were there too. A s
dark descended the battle was
fought out, scoring taking place
at both ends. With only seconds
left the score was 20-20. IC
moved the b a l l q u i c k l y — F r a n k
to F r a n k to F r a n k and then back
to F r a n k again. H e p a s s e d to
Frank who slipped a beautiful
shot to Frank who then leapt
high and potted the b a l l — the
winner! G a s p s from the crowd,
IC had won! B u t no! Away at the
other end F r e d a T e l l e m was
waving her arms, the goal was
d i s a l l o w e d for full time had
just been blown. The teams
clapped each other off the field
a couple of times. A n honourable
draw was the result, but what a
match! The game was enjoyed
by a l l . Everyone arrived at the
ICWA L o u n g e later on for a
feast of tea and sandwiches and
Frank Dennis presented F r e d a
Jones with the 'Mar of the
Match' award — a bottle of
Babycham.
