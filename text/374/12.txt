F E L I X S P O R T
RUGBY
Refreshed from three weeks
of constant booze and turkey
intake over the Christmas
vacation, Bruce B r a d l e y ' s
B r a v e B a n d i t s disembarked at
Catterham Barracks to meet the
w e l l known Welsh Guards X V .
A soldier on the gate, instantly
recognising our style, decided
to promptly march us to the
barber's shop. However, having
been warned of the army's
t r i c k s , and told under no cir-
cumstances to sign anything, he
h a d ^ o settle for showing us to
the gymnasium.
T o the boos and cries of
'foreigners' from the masses of
Welsh privates dotted around
the f i e l d , I C at last took the
field. After being told to put the
field back play eventually
commenced. T h e first twenty
minutes saw l i t t l e of interest
until D e n z i l F r o g was scythed
at the knees by a falling body
and earned a wonderful oscar
with a touching 'death throes'
performance on the touchline.
T e n minutes later a chance
penalty allowed the Guards to
take a 3-0 lead at half-time.
In the second half both the
pack and backs began to play
with more confidence with good
clean ball coming from
B.Austin's sound hooking. It
was from the base of a scrum
that Ray Teethless broke and
dived over for a deserved try
to put IC 6-3 ahead. Play
continued without incident until
the Guard's second row started
bashing his head against a
brick wall, i.e. Keith hippo, and
was consequently sent off for
allowing S.Booth to hit him
back. Ten minutes later a
monstrous penalty kick by the
Guards levelled the score,
which then remained at 6-6. It
was a well deserved result and
a promising start to the new
term.

IC 1st X V played their first
game against a U n i v e r s i t y team
this season on Saturday 11th
January, and were so determined
to do w e l l that only two thirds of
the side got p i s s e d the night
before.
The match started at a
furious pace and I C soon pinned
down the R e a d i n g side in their
half. A penalty to IC was w e l l
k i c k e d by B . F i n n e y , playing in
h i s new position of fly half.
R e a d i n g immediately redressed
the balance by k i c k i n g an easy
penalty from in front of the
posts but I C were undaunted.
Further I C pressure brought
another penalty w h i c h F i n n e y
duly converted but this lead
was to be somewhat short-lived.
The R e a d i n g left wing broke
four tackles and ran i n under
the posts for a converted try
which gave them a 9-6 lead at
this stage.
IC were not to be outdone,
however, and before half-time
two excellent tries were scored
by them. C r e s s w e l l crashed over
from h a l f a yard after an ex-
cellent run by Booth and Finney
broke through near the posts
after a dummy with Stern who
received the attention of three
Reading players — a l l to no
a v a i l . F i n n e y goaled his own
try. R e a d i n g h a d scored yet
another penalty during this
period to half time, and the
score then was 16-12 to IC.
The second half opened at
no less hot a pace and although
the play was end to end through-
out the h a l f proved a trimph
for both defences. Several IC
scoring chances were un-
fortunately squandered by l a c k
of support at the l a s t moment
but this did not detract from a
good second half performance.
Reading scored another two
penalties to IC's one (by
F i n n e y , of course) giving a final
score of 19-18 to IC.
The aftermatch frivolities
were w e l l started by the intro-
duction of an eight pint j u g
(full of beer) for a cost of a
mere 8 Op. Reading Union
enjoyed a repertoire of songs
previously unheard of by them
and the Bobs Stern and A u s t i n
had an 'alarming' time and so
decided not to roll out the
barrel.

L a s t Saturday, being the first Saturday of this term saw the
reappearance of*IC's E x t r a 1st X V on the rugby field. The occ-
asion was an away fixture at R e a d i n g U n i v e r s i t y against their
2nd X V .
Three games had been arranged for this particular Saturday,
but due to a number of late
' c r o s s i n g s - o f f , one o ' c l o c k
saw another fiasco, when there
was only enough players to
field two complete teams, and
a number of A team players
were drafted into the E x t r a s .
P o s i t i o n selection was decided
in the dressing room, w h i c h
decided that N e i l H i c k i n g
should play hooker, a d e c i s i o n
with w h i c h he did not com-
pletely agree.
When we reached the p i t c h ,
we saw fifteen men in a l l kinds
of attire who, we found out some
minutes later, were to be our
opposition. The game was
underway and from the distance
the Reading pack were driven
back at the first scrum, it
seemed a mere formality that I C
would notch up another victory.
But, a l a s , at this stage we
were unaware of the latent
speed of the Reading b a c k s ,
which was to prove so d e c i s i v e
in the final a n a l y s i s . In fact,
after winning the early heated
exchanges, the R e a d i n g backs
had their first opportunity to
stretch their legs, and our
defence was split. Only good
cover by two of the back row
(no names!) and the h a l f backs
prevented a score. B u t Rea'ding
scored some minutes later,
from the hard running of their
h a c k s . No blame could be put
on our b a c k s , they just didn't
have Reading matched for speed,
the try, however was converted
and another followed shortly,
which was not converted,
leaving a half time score in
Reading's favour of 10-0.
The second was now ours
for the taking. We had the slope
in our favour along with the
fairly strong wind on our b a c k s .
From the k i c k off, a c l e a n
catch by Marik Sergot, a wedge,
a player offside and within
seconds R e a d i n g had scored
again. The wind had been blown
out of our s a i l s and when the
referee allowed a try a l i t t l e
later o n , which had been
touched down by A l u n D a v i e s
before, it seemed our task was
impossible. A t this stage the
team for once started to ' c l i c k '
and we were p r e s s i n g hard near
'heir line for a long while,
during w h i c h we did everything
but score. C h r i s Whiteley made
some excellent breaks through
the muddle and was ably
supported by Rob Doyle, and
Marik Sergot, both playing w e l l
but were both stopped only
inches short on several occ-
a s i o n s . A penalty move
i n v o l v i n g Rob and Marik, in the
same v e i n , was also effective
but good cover tackling by
Reading again foiled us.
We were now fully committed
to attack and c a p i t a l i s i n g on
this situation, Reading once
more made a fast break and
scored again. We did, however,
continue our intense pressure
for the remainder of the game
and a try was certain. T h i s ,
however, only came after some
hard and good work i n the
centre by M i k e G i b s o n . H e
made the i n i t i a l break down the
right hand side, which was
carried on by the forwards in
support and the ball moved
across the width of the field
and Male Ranson scored in the
comer. Only minutes now
remained and the score was not
to change over that period,
leaving the score at 26-4 i n
Reading's Cavour.

P . P . S . I d i d not really want to
be captain this week, w a s h i n g

my job was not helped by the
considerate person who filled
my k i t bag with drain-pipe's,'
what? A l l that with a s a c k f u l l
of shirts and having to pacify
the Reading p o l i c e . N o , m y o l d
man i s not a dustman. Thank
you and Goodnight (a nice
felicitation).
