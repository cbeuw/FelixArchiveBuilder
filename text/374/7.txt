FELIX 7
ALL NIGHT RAVEUP . .
GUILDS C A R N I V A L
Mad but "superb" Entertainment
R i z S h a k i r
L a s t Saturday saw the major
C" & G rag event of this s e s s i o n .
The b a s i c idea behind this
being to organise a m u s i c a l
extravaganza that would go on
through the night into the
following day. Thus a l l the
students involved in last term's
fund raising (stunts of varying
degrees of eccentricity and
sheer lunacy, that might cause
alarm over students' sanity were
performed) could have twelve
hours in which to practice their
by now perfected s k i l l s .
Seriously though, on a less
sarcastic and frivolous note, it
was a well organised event for
the enjoyment and entertainment
of a l l the people lucky enough
to acquire tickets. A wide range
of tastes were catered for and
the evening kicked off with
Sutherland Brothers and
Quiver, who never seem to give
a mediocre performance on the
stage. Their act and style has
the ability to set any audience
alight and this was well
u t i l i s e d .
Undoubtedly the star att-
raction (they certainly proved
their worth) of the whole show
was Manfred Mann's Earth
Hand. There was no real flash
of the old Manfred Mann gim-
m i c k s , such as taking off his
trousers or dragging some of
the female population of the
Paul Ekpenyong
'City & Guilds President Manfred Mann's Earth Hand'
audience on to the stage. T h i s
concert was a serious one i u
which the musical talent of
each member of the band were
coherently brought together to
produce what one can only
describe as a truly incredible
m u s i c a l experience to have
been seen of this band to date.
The last band .of the show
were Boh K e r r ' s Whoopee B a n d .
Their task was e s s e n t i a l l y to
make sure that no one was
getting too bored at 2a.m. in the
morning. T h i s they achieved
with a lighthearted and at times
very c o m i c a l performance that
totally lacked, any talent
musically speaking. However,
this, hardly mattered since by
this time everybody had a .fair
amount of alcohol in their
system. Anyhow. everyone
appreciated their performance.
For those who managed to
arrive at the concert very early
Tim Rose provided a suitable
beginning to the night's show.
The m u s i c a l part of the
night having come to an end,
the crowd which had by now
gathered in the .ICR to observe
the comedians of ' B o b K e r r ' s
Whoopee B a n d ' dispersed. The
more energetic moved to the
D i s c o where they could expend
their surplus energy. Where as
those not so athletically
i n c l i n e d either made their way
to the bar (which was s t i l l open)
or to the Great H a l l where two
films were being shown. These
films were ' T h e P i l l ' and
'There is a G i r l in my Soup'.
Several of the people were
interviewed during the latter
part of the C a r n i v a l and the
general concensus of opinion
was that it had been enjoyable
and was a pleasant experience.
The President of the G u i l d s
U n i o n , Jenny Jones, was also
approached and she seemed
well pleased with the manner
in which the events had pro-
gressed. She told us that they
had at least 'broken even'.
