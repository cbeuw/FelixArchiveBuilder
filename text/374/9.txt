F I U X 9
L E T T E R S Cont. from page 3
Manager. Provided I can set up
the aforementioned system, then
ipublically I apply for this post.
I would a l s o expect the removal
of the ban on my photographs
and articles appearing in
F E L I X . In face saving style
Mr.Williams tells me (5/1/75)
that this ban no longer e x i s t s .
Since when M i k e , or did you
j u s t forget to tell me!
Mike Williams has com-
p l a i n e d about the vast amount of
lettrasetting he does. If he did
more editing, rewrote badly
written copy and shortened
lengthy a r t i c l e s , he would
reduce this, and make a better
F E L I X in the process! However
o n the plus side, F E L I X now
has a S U B - E d i t o r ; congrat-
ulations, a long overdue
appointment!
My next c r i t i c s m concerns
the l a c k of news i n F E L I X .
N e w s items that do appear
usually bear little relevance to
I C students, not to mention most
of them are a week or two out
of date! IC N e w s stories might
be hard to find, but London
Further E d u c a t i o n Stories
aren't — Sennet regularly finds
them!
My biggest critism must be
layout. When the present E d i t o r
campaigned for his job he s a i d ,
( F E L I X 5/3/74) that in pro-
ducing a R a g Mag he had
'learnt a h e l l u v a lot about
editorial layout'. Well -where
did a l l that knowledge go
because this year's layout is
abomnibal! Good layout is an
e s s e n t i a l ingredient towards
any good paper, Offset-litho
provides increased layout
control, which h a s n ' t been
fully u t i l i z e d . E v e n so the last
two i s s u e s ' front pages;
dQ show
an encouraging improvement.
Many of my criticsms could
be found i n previous years'
papers. F E L I X might not be
perfect but M i k e Williams has
produced a paper about which
he can be proud. F e w people
realise the immense effort that
goes into any student paper.
Offset-litho gives the E d i t o r
even more headaches. My letters
indicate ways of improving
F E L I X , to give I C students a
better paper. I hope they are
implemented.
Yours sincerely,
C l i v e G.Dewey.

Dear Mr. Dewey,
With regard to your letter
printed in this issue, of F E L I X ,
we had not fully d i s c u s s e d your
last epi-stle (the original letter
of over 2,000 words) hence your
claims of credit for any
improvements s i n c e then are
rather premature. In any c a s e
the ambiguity of your letter
renders any such c l a i m s i n v a l i d .
A l s o , you say i n a l l your
communications to date that
you are a senior member of
Sennet, our s o - c a l l e d s i s t e r
paper. We contacted Jeremy
C l i f t , the sabbatical E d i t o r of
Sennet on this point and it
seems that this c l a i m i s a l s o
premature and (quote) 'merely a
matter of opinion'.
We acknowledge your app-
l i c a t i o n for the post of
A d v e r t i s i n g Manager. T h i s
matter is on the agenda of our
next F E L I X E d i t o r i a l Board
meeting to be held on Monday,
20th January. We a l s o note the
attempt i n your application to
narrow the field down to one
person. If we took only those
people with experience, there
would be no F E L I X staff at a l l
with the exception of the E d i t o r .
In your letter you go so far
as to suggest that the
E d i t o r i a l B o a r d do not edit
a r t i c l e s 'in any acceptable
manner'. Bearing i n mind your
professed a b i l i t y in this field,
we have printed your letter as
we received it. On the point of
news a r t i c l e s , it is our opinion
that a l l news items concerning
students wherever they may be
are relevant and are of pertinent
interest to other students. Why
do news stories, about F E
colleges have to be n e c e s s a r i l y
more relevant to I C students
than those on refectory p r i c e s ,
rents and victimisations?
There being no bounds to
the s i z e of your c r i t i c i s m s , you
move 011 to attack the lay-out
in F E L I X . We can only give you
the opinions of others who are
perhaps more experienced in
this field, viz:— Jeremy C l i f t
(Editor of Sennet): 'really
rather good'; our former litho-
operator, K y r l e G i l l e s p i e , one-
time Editor of 'Office Weekly'
(a post h e l d for twenty years):
'really good, indeed quite
excellent': Dave Segar, sales
representative of Addressograph-
Multi graph L t d : 'very good
indeed'; and finally Mr. Carter,
sales representative i n the
Varityper d i v i s i o n of the same
company: 'first class'.
It never has been our p o l i c y
to place bans on articles or
photography by persons other
than the F E L I X staff and
e s p e c i a l l y not yours. In fact we
draw your attention to the fact
that your photographs were
used for the S T O I C centre
spread (FELIX, Issue No. 368),
so what i n the h e l l are you
talking, about? Letrasetting is
N O T the major task that soaks
up a l l our energy when pro-
ducing a F E L I X . If there were
ever such a case as you mention
("none of us can remember such
a case) then we take this
opportunity to inform you that
you are sadly behind the times
i n your thinking. Incidently,
your own efforts (when you were
on the F E L I X staff) i n this
field were notably abominable
(see FELIX, Issue No. 361).
In c o n c l u s i o n , we should
l i k e to express our curiosity
that you should see fit to d i s -
tribute your original letter to a l l
members of the I C U P u b l i c -
ations B o a r d , the P r e s i d e n t s of
the Constituent C o l l e g e U n i o n s ,

" NOW T H A T I am finally
back at college I thought that
it was about time that I did
something about my task as
secretary of the Motor C y c l e
section of the. C & G Motor
C l u b . For those who do not
know what happened, I broke
my thigh bone in a car crash,
the obvious moral is to ride
motor c y c l e s as they seem to
be safer! My aim this year is to
try and get us some f a c i l i t i e s
for keeping, and more important,
repairing and rebuilding
machines belonging to the
members. I have already taken
steps in this direction, and I
think Dr.Besant is very
interested in the section and its
a c t i v i t i e s , and we may be able
to look to him for a s s i s t a n c e ,
having a member of staff to
help w i l l be very useful,
e s p e c i a l l y being in the same
department as Professor Ford,
who is President of the Motor
C l u b .
Now, about this Honda we
are going to race, I think it is
a very good idea B U T , I would
need a lot of persuading to pay
£50 for a,CP. 72, even more the
£200 this bloke is a s k i n g for it,
or the £600 it is supposed to be
worth, and I do not consider it
w i l l really benefit a l l the
members. A n d a s a council
member I feel that it would be a
waste of Union money. I would
far rather spend the money
equipping a good workshop,
which is what I feel we need.
L a s t l y I can not really see U F C
giving us that amount of money
anyway so I w i l l direct my
energies towards a more modest
sum.
it seems to me that the
section offers little to its'
members, this probably accounts
for the fact that there are only
ten members, no facility
involving c l u b funds can be
used by non-members, but don't
let that stop you from coming
visor), and to the H o n . Secretary
of I C U ostensibly for I C U
C o u n c i l records (though this i s
clearly out of the question) and
yet you did not send copies to
the individual members of the
F E L I X E d i t o r i a l Board, who
were the main targets of your
c r i t i c i s m s .
Yours sincerely,

to the meetings. Judging by the
500cc (and over) ironware I
have seen around college there
are a lot of potential members,

and the Suzy and Trident 750's
I have seen. I am not sure about
the membership position, but
college staff are particularly
welcome to the meetings, Mech.

The meetings are held in the
Southside bar at 1.00p.m. on
Wednesdays. I feel that the
meetings should be more s o c i a l ,
like a pre-arranged piss-up in
the Union bar on some night,
depending on suggestions w h i c h
are always welcome. If any
one w i s h e s to join then you
should go to Tony Rain e in the
G u i l d s Union Office and ask to
join the Motor C l u b , Motor
C y c l e section. A list of
members is kept by me and is
shown below, so if you are not
on it you could m i s s out on
something good. I would a l s o
like to point out that member-
ship involves paying a
subscription for those who
think otherwise.
That bit above was written
for last week's F E L I X but I
m i s s e d the copy date so I am
going to add a bit, as I write,
this I am listening to 'Beggers
Banquet' through a pair of those
Videotone Speakers that I got
from Honest Mick Enterprises
and they are .really good, in
fact, perfect.
'We are going to try and build
up a fleet of lightweights,
probably Bantams, that we can
hire out to members whose
bikes do not work so you can
go and get spares and the l i k e .
Y o u w i l l have to provide your
own insurance. So if you know
of any Bantams going really
cheap, see Dave Salisbury
( P h y s i c s 2). It does not matter
if they are not road^worthy, but
we can not n i c k them or we w i l l
run into problems when we try
and register them.
