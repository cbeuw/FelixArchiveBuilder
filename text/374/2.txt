F E L I X W I L L undoubtedly be facing a
stiff battle for survival if the I C U E x e c -
utive decide to pursue the idea • - of
reallocating the third sabbatical from the
E d i t o r to a proposed new-style Deputy
P r e s i d e n t who would take on the duties of
a Junior Treasurer.
Granted that the U n i o n w i l l face
financial difficulties in the coming years,
cannot this be faced by creating a
Treasury Committee c o n s i s t i n g of a l l the
U n i o n ' s Junior and Senior Treasurers?
The committee could, if necessary, be
chaired by a newly-created U n i o n Junior
Treasurer whose task it would be to prune
budgets appropriately, b a s i n g h i s de-
c i s i o n s on the recommendations of the
Treasury committee, after approval by
C o u n c i l . T h i s is j u s t a thought, a rough
idea. How about it, Trev ?
A s far as I c a n see without a s a b b a t i c a l
F E L T X E d i t o r , how c a n we print the
Bluebook during the summer? How are we
going to fully utilise the printing facilities
which College has made available to us?
Who can take care of a l l the outside jobs
w h i c h need technical c h e c k i n g before they
can be run on the offset-litho? Consider
what w i l l happen when the printing unit
including the varitypist, moves over to
C o l l e g e B l o c k (probably within the next
year).
F E L I X copy w i l l be taken from the
F E L I X office to the varitypist then back
to the office for pasting np then back to
C o l l e g e B l o c k to be printed and then the
paper w i l l be shifted back to the office for
folding and c o l l a t i n g . F o r a s a b b a t i c a l i t
w i l l be tortuous, for a n o n - s a b b a t i c a l , , i t
w i l l be i m p o s s i b l e . '
So e s s e n t i a l l y then without a sab-
b a t i c a l Deputy President/Treasurer, I feel
that there are workable, non-sabbatical
alternatives. Without a sabbatical F E L I X

Further to C . G . D e w e y ' s letter, it i s
now understood that I C U P u b l i c a t i o n s
Board is opposed 10 any kind of personal
gain such as was suggested (10%
commission on adverts booked).
I have received a letter from John
R a n d a l l , the President of the N U S con-
cerning the remarks made in last week's
E d i t o r i a l about the N U S attitude to the

publication this week) w i l l b e printed next
week. Should anyone hold any views on
this matter, I should be glad to hear from
them. — . • • < - .

Letter to the President
Imperial College Union,
10th January, 1975.
The President,
Imperial College U n i o n .
Dear Trevor,
The executive has spent a
great deal of time this year
d i s c u s s i n g the status of the
post-graduate affairs officer.
After several s e s s i o n s on this
topic the view agreed by a l l
was that we had here a topic
which c o u l d reasonably be
expected to attract a good
attendance at a U G M . The
executive further agreed that a
good and w e l l prepared debate
on the subject should be sought.
T o these ends we agreed to
postpone the i s s u e of the P G
Affairs Officer becoming a
member of the executive until
there had been time for the
general student body to be
informed that this was being
proposed. When everyone had
had a chance to air their views,
the matter was to be advertised
widely, and put to a U G M .
Straying from this line of
reasoning for a moment, may I
say that I understood that the
executive was supposed to work
together and above a l l
'communicate with each other'
(your words, not mine).
You may understand, s i r , that
I am therefore not a little
annoyed at the presentation of a
motion to add the P G A O to the
executive, at l a s t night's U G M .
The i n c l u s i o n of the motion
was not p u b l i c i s e d . E v e n the
executive was not told of its
i n c l u s i o n — and at our lunch-
time meeting we d i d ask you
what was being d i s c u s s e d .
H o w can you expect a good
debate when only one side
knows when the debate i s to
be?
Y o u r conduct as chairman
during that debate a l s o left
much to be desired; e s p e c i a l l y
your comments just prior to the
vote, which had a very definite
effect on a small assembly.
In summary, s i r , may I
respectfully point out that I,
and I believe I am not alone
amongst the executive in this
view, do not b e l i e v e that you,
or the Honorary Secretary, have
kept good faith with the rest of
the executive over this matter.
I have stated before that I
do not consider 'bitching
sessions' in F E L I X to be a
good thing for the union as a
whole. However, I consider it
necessary to bring this part-
icular matter to the attention of
the student body a s a whole,
if only to ensure that some
people know that this motion
is being d i s c u s s e d .
Y o u r s , most sincerely,
Ron K i l l .
Deputy President.
Apology to Mines
Imperial College Union.
Dear Sir,
It has been drawn to my
attention that some students of
the R o y a l School of Mines were
offended by the statement w h i c h
I made in the E x e c u t i v e News-
letter of December 1st.
A t no time d i d I intend to
indicate any disrespect or

negative feelings towards the
R o y a l School of Mines a s s u c h .
Whilst it i s true that the figures
complied show that the A - l e v e l
standards of entrants i n some
departments of the RSM are
lower than the average for I C ,
I would not infer from this that
students in these departments
are n e c e s s a r i l y l e s s intelligent
than others.
It i s quite widely known that
I do not accept the G C E A - l e v e l
examination performance a s an
indication of intelligence or
intellectual a b i l i t y , what
evidence there is supports that
view. Therefore, I do not w i s h
it to be inferred that I look down
upon my colleagues i n the R S M .
There are many other values by
w h i c h one c a n judge a fellow
human being, i f indeed one
w i s h e s to judge anyone at a l l .
With these comments i n mind,
I w i s h to apologise unreservedly
to those offended by the
relevant paragraph.
Trevor P h i l l i p s ,
President. ICU.
