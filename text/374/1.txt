CONSTITUTIONAL
DISGUST
R E G A R D I N G last week's
inserted statement by the
President concerning the U G M
decision on the Voluntary L e v y ,
F E L I X wishes to express U s
disgust at the way in which
M r . P h i l l i p s promised the F E L I X
staff extra labour to help with
the collation of the issue
(inserting a small single sheet
makes the c o l l a t i n g time app-
reciably longer) but at the last
minute informed us that there
would be no extra help. T h e
President d i d not even bother
to suggest giving us a hand
himself. T h e insert was only
accepted on the understanding
that there would be extra help.
Nevertheless, w e felt
obliged to insert the statement
w h i l s t objecting to the P r e s -
ident's inconsiderate attitude
in v i e w of the extra time a n d
trouble involved.
Sabbatical
Roulette?
L A S T M O N D A Y , at C o u n c i l , it was suggested that the U n i o n ' s
third sabbatical post (the first and second are occupied by the
President and H o n . Sec. respectively) might not be allocated to
the F E L I X Editor for next year.
The suggestion w a s that a
sabbatical Deputy P r e s i d e n t /
B u i l d i n g s Officer would be
appointed. T h i s expanded post
would a l s o incorporate the
functions of a junior treasurer
(Imperial College i s one of very
few U n i v e r s i t i e s who do not
have a junior treasurer â€” full or
part time). However due to the
financial situation the Union
could not support four sab-
b a t i c a l officers. Thus it would
have to be a case of 'one or the
other', and not both a sabbatical
F E L I X E d i t o r and sabbatical
Deputy President.
T h i s move c o u l d , i f carried
out, r i s k the continued exist-
ence of F E L I X . When a s k e d for
his opinion the present F E L I X
Editor, Mike Williams said:
'If the Editorship were to
become non-sabbatical the post
would become completely un-
tenable, especially in view of
the fact that the printing unit
will probably be moving to
College Block sometime during
the next year. Also the viability
of Union publications such as
the 'Blue Book' which is
produced during the summer
would be at risk. As for the USK
Handbook its future could look
extremely bleak'.
However, it must be pointed
out that the idea i s s t i l l in the
embryo stage.

A T L A S T W E E K ' S U G M an inquorate gathering of approximately'
sixty members w a s startled to find itself voting on a constitutional
change.
Guess
who's c o m i n g
to C o u n c i l ?
I T WAS A G R E E D by ,the
Imperial College U n i o n C o u n c i l
l a s t Monday to invite Mr. C a r l
Seaford, the D o m e s t i c . ' B u r s a r
to its next meeting. T h e reason
behind this is believed to be
due to the fact that the D o m e s t i c
Bursar i s the p r i n c i p a l officer
of the C o l l e g e i n most contact
with the students. It i s under-
stood that h e w i l l address
C o u n c i l and then invite
questions.
Just before the proposal that
the P G Affairs Officer should
become a member o f d i e
executive, the President stated
from the chair that he would
allow only one speech for a n d
one against the proposal.
Although the chair w a s c h a l -
lenged o n this point, the
challenge was defeated on the
vote. T h e motion was thus voted
on after one speech for, one
speech against plus a summing
up by the proposer (the first
speaker) and i t w a s p a s s e d .
Concern
A t least one member of the
executive i s concerned at the
manner i n which the debate was
conducted (See letter on page 2)
as w e l l as the fact that no
p u b l i c i t y h a d been given to
this motion beforehand.
The result w a s that the
constitutional change effectively
was 'rushed through'.
