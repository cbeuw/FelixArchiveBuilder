Y O U R C H A N C E T O INFLUENCE WHERE Y O U LIVE N E X T YEAR
O n the 24th of March the College
is staging a seminar which could have
far reaching consequences for the
student population at IC.
The subject of the seminar is
accommodation and it will be
attended by representatives of
interested groups, both from those
who provide accommodation and
those who live in it.
It is in the nature of things that the
providers, being a small group with a
strong interest in accommodation
will be well represented, but what
about the other side? What about
you?
There is some danger that the
endemic IC disease of apathy will
mean that students will fail to make
their opinions known with the result
that decisions will be made in
ignorance of what your feelings on
the subject are and which will
a d v e r s e l y affect y o u r future
accommodation prospects.
For example, supposing the
College was able to acquire new
properties or adapt existing ones,
what pattern of requirements should
be aimed at? Should the College
provide flats, single rooms, doubles,
triples, dormitories or what? Should
the rents charged in any new
schemes be bumped up to include
cleaning and other services or would
you prefer to be able to chose how
you spend your money?
Is it worth the College taking on
comparatively expensive places
close by or would you rather pay less
and live in scruffy accommodation
miles away from College? Or should
the College wash its hands of the
whole business and leave you to the
tender mercies of the flat-agencies
and the Rachmans?
Well, no-one really knows the
answers to these questions —
although the answers to some may
seem fairly obvious — but without
precise information it is difficult for
the College to do a lot to help on
account of the risk of providing
accommodation that no one wants
and ending up having to foot an
enormous bill.
T o give a real example of the
dilemma that this lack of information
causes, take the case of some flats in
Queensgate that have recently been
under consideration. The flats have
very big rooms, all newly decorated
with high quality furniture — one flat
even has a piano.
Some of the rooms are the size of
3/4 ordinary single rooms. In a
shared room ie double, the rent
would be something over £20 per
week and all within crawling distance
of College.
If the College were to take these
places on and nobody wanted them,
it would all be a rather pointless and,
of course, very expensive exercise.
O n the other hand, if they are not
taken on it means that fifty people
who could have lived in them will
probably end up paying something
similar — or more — in a less
convenient locality, like Streatham.
This kind of dilemma can only be
resolved with the help of certain bits
of information, eg: What rent would
you pay for somewhere close to
College? If, say, you wanted to share
a flat with six friends, what would you
say to a place with two double
bedrooms and one triple? How
important is it to you to find
somewhere close to College? What
sort of place do you want to live in ?
With all this sort of thing in mind
and with the aforementioned seminar
only about eight weeks away, it
would seem to be of the greatest
importance for information on what
y o u want out of the accommodation
system and what you are getting out
of it already to be collected and made
available so that informed decisions
can be made which will help to ensure
that IC students are adequately
housed.
In order to collect this information
there is a section of the survey in this
edition of FELIX which deals With
accommodation.
There will be a photo competition
for pictures of your accommodation.
Full details are printed elsewhere in
FELIX.
If no-one shows any interest in this
exercise, the College would be quite
justified in saying to the Union that
since no-one seems to be in the least
bit concerned about accommoda-
tion, it can't be a problem and thus
the College can't be expected to
waste its hard pressed resources
on providing it.
The action that the College takes
will reflect the degree to which you
participate in the seminar.
If you have any bright ideas
about the accommodation problem
and the attempts made by the
various agencies to solve il perhaps
you would like to come up to the
Welfare Centre for a cup of coffee
and a chat about it.
