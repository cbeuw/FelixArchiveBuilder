R A G A R T I C L E
This is just a quick w o r d to remind you
that R a g is still alive. In fact, if you
thought it all stopped dead after Rag
Week, then you'd better think again as
we've got plenty of goodies lined up for
you this term.
Firstly (as always) there are the C C U
collections, which I'm sure you'll hear
about from them, including the I n t e r - C C U
Monopoly stunt in early February. Also
we'll be having more Rag M a g trips, so
keep your ears a n d eyes open for news of
those.
The main event though, is to be held
jointly with the National Deaf Children's
Society, and as they have just elected a
new Scottish chairman, we're having a
S p o n s o r e d C a b e r T o s s i n g in P r i n c e s
Gardens on Saturday 8th M a r c h . Deaf
children from local schools will be cominq
to toss their (foam rubber) cabers, and
we'll be presenting two of these schools
with a radio-hearing aid bouqht from the
proceeds of the Rag Procession. So, if you
want to play silly games, wear a kilt, or
just join the kids for their jelly and ice
cream, keep watching this space, or come
to the n e x t R a g C o m m i t t e e M e e t i n g ,
which is on Wednesday 30th January at
7:00pm in the I C W A Lounge. B y the way,
the S u m m e r Fete is to be on 3rd M a y this
year, so get thinking about those stalls
and sideshows.
T h e only other event this term is to be
another Rag Disco in the last week of
term. Talking of discos, the Toga Party
w a s q u i t e s u c c e s s f u l , a n d a l t h o u g h
disappointed at the turnout, I was pleased
to see that those who did come joined in
w i t h t h e s p i r i t of the o c c a s i o n a n d
actually wore togas (of all shapes, sizes,
styles and colours).

thanks to the crowd who did door-work
or cleaned up, namely Kirsten and J a n ,
Tansy and M o , Katy, M a r c o , Rich, Sean,

I've either forgotten or don't know the

Bye for now,

U G M R E P O R T
W e l l f o l k s , yet a n o t h e r U G M has
passed, attended once again by the F F
(faithful few) or should that be S C F F
(slightly confused faithful few)?
The reports were accepted with hardly
a complaint, so Hall residents may find
themselves making their own beds and
cleaning their rooms in the near future
and hence produce a 26% reduction in
staff labour costs. T e d Heath is likely to
receive a petition against increases in
o v e r s e a s s t u d e n t s fees after M r F o x
noted the rumours that M r Heath might
be leading a back bench revolt. Soon
available will be A Guide On How To
Lobby Your MP by M r F o x .
J o h n M u r p h y was elected as ordinary
member of the Permanent W o r k i n g Party
after Philip Cole's speech was judged as a
try for a sympathy vote, ("I know J o h n ,
he's a nice chap, he lives next door to
me, but . . . ").
The bylaw changes proposed by M r
Stotesbury, were passed before some had
worked out the slightly complex ordering
of Exec News and extras and hence
found out what the changes were. The
ever alert M r Brain, however, drew to our
a t t e n t i o n the fact that the p r o p o s e d
Standing Orders changes would put a set
time limit on speeches and extensions,
thus preventing the full explanation of
complicated motions. Needless to say the
changes were defeated.
O n to the m o t i o n s . M r S t o t e s b u r y
seemed to have had a field day trying to
outlaw unequal/unfair media coverage for
election candidates. The fact that the
redraft was presented in such a manner
that when coupled with the motion in Exec
News it became rather contusing, to say
the least, plus no opposition speech and
the usual touch of apathy, enabled the
motion to be passed and pass by us.
I C U seems to have been a bit behind
the times, but at last it has adopted the
U N Universal Declaration O n H u m a n
R i g h t s (1948) together with n o t e s o n
Russian intervention in Afghanistan and
Apartheid as proposed by T i m Hillyer.
M o v e d from sixth place to third, M s
Pratt's motion noted that nuclear waste is
being transported through L o n d o n on
three nights per week in containers which
have only been tested in 30mph crash
conditions (when they share tracks with
lOOmph trains) and three containers have
already been derailed and some withdrawn
as unsafe. It also n o t e d that it was
rerouted at one time but due to extra
cost is now once again passing through
London .
The motion was passed and so the I C U
banner will be attending the demonstration
(1:00pm on Saturday 26th January at
Primrose Hill â€” C h a l k F a r m underground)
against the use of the L o n d o n route.
The motion on student grants (proposed
by Bernard Smith) seemed straightforward
enough, but what is this in I C U believes
(2) "That students in metropolitan cities
are in considerable f i n a n c i a l hardship
compared to students in campus univer-
sities" (my stressing), you-must-be-joking
time: as M s Armitage pointed out in her
opposing speech the only hardship is due
to non-payment of parental contributions
(ie the means test granted). O n voting, a
second count had to be taken, the motion
being defeated by just seven votes.
The motion on Apartheid will now be
read at the next U G M (Tuesday 5th
February), which just happens to clash
with M i n e s U G M . . .

Today you have the rare and dubious
pleasure of experiencing one of rny shorter
but more exhilarating contributions to this
mag. It gives me great pleasure and a deep
sense of satisfaction to give to you plucky few
who are still with me the knowledge that this
isn't really a continuation of the Sexploits Of
Mary Millington as featured in one of the
glossy mags that are always to high on the
shelves, but a dreary discourse on another of
those bori ng topics that seem to permeate the
very being of us ardent article alliterators.
C h a p t e r 8: E x h a u s t e d
You crawl into the Union Building, call the
lift, spend many agonized minutes in almost
total darkness, stared at by the phospho-
rescent feel of the graffiti of the Socialist
W s, you arrive at the top exhausted
by the sheer length of this sentence, turn
left t h r o u g h the double doors, stagger
past the W e l f a r e C e n t r e , at the end
summing up enough breath, you manage
one final scream "HELP".
"Oh goody, we need all the help we
can get." You are dragged into a little
room and given your free cup of coffee.
"Congratulations, you are a fully fledged
member of the Community Action Group."

MONTY F. OR A SONG FOR THE ENGINEERS
Remember this?
"Your Honorary Craduands are
of an age where their contribution to
the,.material progress of society
through technology is mainly of the
past. "\ a contentious statement from
Sir Monty Finniston when he made
his address to IC for Commemo-
ration Day last term. At that time
the eponymous Finniston committee
was completing its report on the
state of the engineering profession
of today, a weighty project of some
two-and-a-half years in its execution.
The result is a somewhat pessimistic
view of the plight of the engineer. The
report also investigates the lack of
appreciation of engineering skills and
the lack of technical comprehension
in the higher strata of management,
but although it accurately identifies
the problems, the answers are not so
forthcoming.
The underlying idea (which is a
sound one) is the integration of
business and engineering, as well as
the supplementing of education in
engineering as a step in the formation
of a new public image for the
engineer. In line with this the
Finniston committee also sings the
praises of setting up an Engineering
Authority as a bulwark against the
collages of Britain in manufacturing
industry and includes the suggestion
that material incentive should be
offered to prospective engineers; at
university level, a bursary, in addition
to scholarships or the usual grants.
Emphasis is laid on more practical
work and the introduction of more
women to engineering. A proposed
cure for one cause of anxiety, the
standard of British engineering
degrees relative to European ones, is
the adoption of a new three-tier
degree system, in contrast with the
present system.
All of this invites comparision with
the s y s t e m at I C . T h e T o t a l
Technology course has produced its
first graduates, sharing the same
aims as the Finniston committee.
A m o n g the three- c o n s t i t u e n t
colleges, City and Guilds is unique in
having their Engineering B o a r d ,
interposed between departmental
committees and the Central Board of
Studies. The object of the Engineer-
ing Board is to unify the departments
and lead to faster, more convenient
dealings with the Board of Studies.
F a m i l y r e s e m b l a n c e b e t w e e n
departments plays a large part in its
successful operation; at this level it
appears practicable, but can it work
on a larger scale? Regrettably, the
Engineering Authority may turn out
to be yet another institution,
unadventurous and of little deter-
mination.
Making notes and asking ques-
tions is simple; providing answers,
the right answers, is not. It seems
ironic that Sir Monty Finniston
should have ended his address by
offering his c o n g r a t u l a t i o n s to
graduates whose degrees, by virtue
of his proposals, might soon be out of
date.
