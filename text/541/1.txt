UGM GRANTS MOTION DEFEATED
' S T U D E N T S C A N D O W I T H O U T LUXURIES'
Jo Armitage, President of the City and Guilds Union,
spoke against a motion on student grants at last
Tuesdays U G M . She said students should accept a
decrease in grants. "A student on a full grant must be
prepared to do without luxuries. We are fighting against
the education cuts. It is impossible to ask for extra
money for students."
T h e m o t i o n w h i c h w a s
proposed by Bernard Smith
called for an immediate re-
appraisal of the grants system,
particularly with reference to
London . The speech against by
J o Armitage was enough to
defeat the motion by seven
votes. In an interview with
F E L I X , Bernard Smith said, "/
am very surprised that the UGM
decided not to support
discussion on Student Grants,
as we are now in a position
where ICU is in favour of
freezing the present grant levels.
There was no mention of
abolishment of the means test as
this is already Union policy, and
has the support of most (if not
all) students at IC. This motion
was designed to help promote
discussion on student grants and
as such had the support of the
External Affairs Committee. The
present grant level is only
acceptable if students do not
accept the following principles."
M r Smith outlined his six
principles:
1) Students should have two
square meals a day.
2) Students should be able to
clothe themselves.
3) Students should live in heated
and lighted rooms.
4) Students should have the
funds to study using books and
stationery.
5) Students should not claim
unemployment benefit during
the short vacations.
6) The grant should allow
students to participate in extra
mural activities.
M r Smith said that it is clear
that J o a n d the majority of the
U G M do not accept one (or
more) of these principles.
N U S P r e s i d e n t , T r e v o r
Phillips, said many bright school
leavers were seeing study as
'second best' to getting a job
straight away because of the
inadequate grants system. N U S
is claiming for a rise in the full
annual grant, for an average
U n i v e r s i t y s t u d e n t o u t s i d e
L o n d o n , of 36 per cent. T h e
Daily Express described the
N U S demand as the action of
ignorant louts.National Student
describes the Daily Express
comments as vulgar abuse.
