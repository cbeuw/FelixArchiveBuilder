"Imperial College Radio News at Six,
Good Evening"; a familiar sound on 301 metres,
but what exactly is I.C.Radio News? Contrary to
common belief things do happen at Imperial, quite
often important, and I.C.R.N. exists to report
on these occurences. What generally happens
behind the scenes is: after our reporter obtains
the story, for instance from one of the Union
offices, it is brought back to the station and
written up for that day's bulletins. In addition to
our daily news coverage we have a weekly in-
depth look at what has been happening around
College. This programme is called'301 Newsline',
and is broadcast between 6.40 and 7pm on
Wendesday evenings. In '301 Newsline' we
generally find and interview the people
responsible for the news, thus bringing out
certain aspects of a story that cannot be put over
in a news story.
Possibly the key to being able to report on as
much as we do and find sufficient news to
produce daily bulletins relies on organisation,
possibly efficiency, but mainly on something
happening. If you know of something that you
think we might like to know about, then phone us
on Internal 3440 or contact the station. The same
applies if you want to know more about Imperial
College Radio News, or want to join us, as we're
always ready to welcome new people.
