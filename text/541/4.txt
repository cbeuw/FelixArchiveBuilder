W h a t defines a folk club is
not necessarily the music but
t h e c l u b a t m o s p h e r e . In a
concert is is difficult for the
artist to establish a rapport
with the audience, but in a club
situation, where the numbers
are less and the environment
more informal, it is easier for
the audience to communicate
with the performer.

"specialised" because of the
low membership and audience
figures, as I have said, this is
largely due to widely held
preconceived ideas which his
ietter does little to improve.
Regarding the theme of M r
Berry's letter, I have my own
personal opinions, but I neither
feel qualified or well enough
informed to commit them to
paper.

Dear C o l i n
I a m writing to you because
the majority of posters advertis-
ing our films have been torn
down over the last few weeks. I
a m s u r e t h a t m a n y o t h e r
societies have had the same
problem. I would like to bring
to the attention of the people
responsible for this the time
and expense involved in pro-
ducing them, and to ask them
to refrain from vandalising in
the future.

Sir,
In a letter to F E L I X regarding
entertainment in this College,
M i c k Berry referred to Imperial
College Folk C l u b as catering
for "specialised groups". A s I
spend a large proportion of my
time attempting to convince
people of the opposite I feel
t h a t t h i s d a m a g i n g r e m a r k
cannot go unchallenged.
It is precisely this misinformed
opinion of folk entertainment
that is the cause of the death
blow to so many clubs, particu
larly in the L o n d o n area and
even more so in colleges. M a n y
p e o p l e , s o m e of w h o m are
members of folk clubs, have a
p r e c o n c e i v e d i d e a of w h a t
constitutes a folk song.
If by specialised, M r Berry
means the type of music and
artists, I would like to give him
a few comparisons. C o m p a r e if
you will: G a y and Terry W o o d s
with S a m Stephens and Anne
Lennox-Martin; J o h n Foreman
with Dave Burland; N i c Jones
with Les Barker; or Roaring
Jelly with Waterfall. A s most of
the F E L I X readership will most
likely be unfamiliar with those
names, I would like to point
out that last term one of our
guest b a n d s , the c e l e b r a t e d
Ratliffe Stout B a n d , finished off
with a medley of rock'n'roll
numbers, also several of our
f l o o r s i n g e r s p l a y far f r o m
traditional songs. In short, M r
Berry, there is no specific 'folk
music'.
I would also like to draw
your attention to two tradtional
s o n g s o n r e c o r d . T h e first,
which I personally think is the
definitive version, is Whiskey In
The Jar by Thin L i z z y and
secondly a 'punk' version of
Wild Rover by Jeep.
Imperial College Folk C l u b is
also ahead of similar clubs in
presenting different forms of
entertainment, our next event
is a morris dancing workshop.
This may fall into some peoples
preconception of folk, but it is
the first time that we have ever
attempted such a venture. Also
a favourite performer at this
club is Les Barker, a poet who

"I'll have to admit it just slipped my
m i n d , " he said nonchalantly. Despite the
fact that the President was referring to
the instructions arising from the great
Corrie Anti-Abortion Bill debate (passed
last U G M ) the c r o w d did not arise as one
mass and devour him in a fit of anger.
Perhaps those who attend U G M s have
become hardened to the idea that they
are just talking shops?

President that people who go to parties in
the J C R have little regard for their coats and
following this enlightenment from guru
Brain we threw out a standing order change
thus ensuring that he could speak at U G M s
for at least thirty minutes should we decide
to give ourselves a thrill.

The election rules were changed with no
opposition but considerable confusion.

Grants didn't do so well. By a small
majority we decided not to campaign for
liberty from the poverty of the inner city by
increasing metropolitan student grants. It
was even suggested that not campaigning
for higher grants could help save the
education system.

Just as we thought everything was over,
Jo Armitage arose and read out a new
amended motion on Apartheid. It aimed to
delete motions on job recruitment and
sporting links passed at previous meetings
packed out by members of the Royal School
of Mines U n i o n .
Y o u could only admire such courage
a t b e i n g p r e p a r e d to s t a n d up to the
collective wrath of R S M U at being taken
unawares. A t this meeting they were not
present in force and some were already
beginning to seeth when the riot was
arrested by a procedural motion to adjourn
to the next meeting.
