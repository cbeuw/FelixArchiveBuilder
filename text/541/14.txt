RAMONES
Phil Spector meets the cretin hoppers from
New York. Yes, the new Ramones L P is
produced by the 'Wall of Sound' man. The
production is a wall of sound, which suits the
Ramones style very well.
Side one c o m m e n c e s with Rock'n'Roll
Radio, a s o n g that sings the praise of
predicably enough, rock'n'roll radio as well as
T Rex, E d Sullivan, Alan Freed etc. Quite
good. f"m Affected is more like it, chainsaw
rhythm guitar and really ratty vocals from
Joey, it's a love song actually, but only the
Ramones write love songs that sound like a
sawmill at full production! The Life On The
Road song is next called Danny Says it's a
heartfelt moan about not being able to surf in
Idaho and the rigours of touring, it's slow but
builds up to loud finish. Chinese Rocks next,
which is the definitive drug addicts song, good,
fast and tacky. The Return Of Jackie And
Judy which features Jackie (the punk) and
Judy (the runt) who were first observed on the
Ramones first L P , this song is an attempt to
gain further mileage out of the original song
(Judy Is A Punk) but it doesn't really work in
my view and is a bit redundant. The last track
on side one is Let's G o which is the Ramones
m o a n i n g a b o u t not being able to go to
Vietnam, a long running theme in the Ramones
history. Subject matter aside, it's quite a spiffy
little song. Baby / Love You kicks off side two
and it is godawful, to say it's the worst track
I've ever h e a r d by the R a m o n e s is an
understatement. / Can't Make It On Time
salvages things somewhat, sounding like the
days of 1976/77, quite nostalgic really. This
Ain't Havana is in the same vein and is really
good, in fact I half expected a few Gabba
Gabba Heys in the chorus but had to settle for
"Ba-Ba-Bannana/This Ain't Havana" but the
song is a real pogoer which please me. The
title song from Rock'n'Roll Highschool is next
and starts off with a powerchord and feedback,
in the best punk tradition i , and just leaps out
of the speakers at about the speed of light, a
trully great track. All They Way, even better as
it has Dee Dee shouting 1-2-3-4 (or wun-too-
free-fore to give it it s ethnic pronunciation),
another classic Ramones track that leaves
smoke coming out of the speakers, as does the
last t r a c k High Risk Insurance a n o t h e r
buzzsaw sound song that really zooms along.
This is a fairly good Ramones L P , most of
the songs are truly dumb with only two and a
half really bad songs on it. It seems nothing
can stop the Ramones which is fine and I hope
they keep the cretins hopping (myself included)
until the end of the century.
SINGLES
THE SPECIAL A K A LIVE EP
Three out of three for the Specials! The live
E P that is the Specials latest release captures
some of the excitement of seeing (and hearing)
the band live. Side one was recorded at the
Lyceum and features Too Much, Too Young, a
song from their L P about avoiding marriage,
kids and the like until you're older. This ends
and an old favourite G u n s Of Navarone
completes side one, by the Skatalites (I think)
originally it still sounds as fresh as ever. O n
side two we have the Skinhead Symphony
comprising of Long Shot Kick The Bucket,
Liquidator and Skinhead Moonstomp. Being
o l d e n o u g h to r e m e m b e r that o - o - o l d
moonstomping at the turn of the last decade
these three songs brought a tear to my eye to
hear these old favourites again, performed by
the Specials in immaculate style.

LADIES RUGBY
This was a return meeting of the two
teams and turned out to be even
closer than the previous one.
Played at Harlington in front of a
good number of IC supporters and the
Nationwide television cameras, this
was a t h o r o u g h l y entertaining and
absorbing match to watch. The game
was played in a hard but fair spirit and
all the ladies put in 110%, which made
all their training worthwhile.
The glory of the day went to the IC
pack. They were superb, winning set
scrums, through Barbara and lineouts,
through Claire, they were able to give,
scrum half Fay a good deal of clean
possession. Only a little inexperience
in the 3s and some good tackling by
U C prevented IC from winning this
match.
O n c e again, the outstanding aspect
of play was the tackling. Although
lacking a little in strength and speed
compared to men, the ladies produced
textbook tackles with the best coming
from Silvana, Fay and Jane. (These
three could teach the 1st X V a lot.)
A l t h o u g h all the l a d i e s p l a y e d
extremely well a special mention must
go to Fay, Julia (what a pair of hands!)
and Shirley, who as captain led her
side to a very capable performance of
rugby football.
Team: Lynn, Lesley, Claire, Mary
E r s k i n , M a r y H a r r i n g t o n , J e n n y ,
Barbara, Shirley, Faye, Cathy, Caroline,
Julia, Sue, Jane and Silvana.

IC 1st XV vs Kings College:
6—3
As the score indicates this was a
very close match and one that IC did
Well to win.
Right from the start, we knew it was
going to be a hard match, with the
forwards having to do a lot of the
work. All credit must go to the IC pack
for a spirited performance throughout
the whole game. They supplied the
backs, through Phil Ratcliffe, with a lot
of good clean ball and we spent a lot
of the first half attacking the Kings
tryline.
Due to some quick cover work by
their back row, we were limited to a
single try. This came about from a
scrum on the Kings 25yd line. The ball
was won cleanly and fed to me at
number ten. I gave a scissors pass to
John Chandler, at inside centre, and
he used a sharp piece of acceleration
to beat four players and score a well
worked try.
In the second half with the wind
favouring Kings, we spent a good part
of the time defending in our own half.
D u e to s o m e s o l i d t a c k l i n g a n d
coverwork the only score that Kings
managed was a single penalty kick.
This was a hard earned and well
deserved victory and continues our
unbeaten record this term.

TABLE TENNIS
OK, you've had all Christmas and
two weeks extra to recover from last
term's reports . . . so this one is a
doozy (a doozy is a dangerous animal
— or did I dream it?). Anyway, back to
the s t a r t / o n to the e n d : R e s u l t s
(arranged partly chronologically and
partly in the order they . . . no, that's
too corny).
IC 2nd vs EXILES 5th (AWAY): 5-4
Stean (late replacement) lost his
first matches of the season (all of
'em). Tye won two and member of
staff and new superstar John Blount
won all three . . . and then tnere was
Christmas.
IC 3rd vs TEXACO 2nd: 8-1
Next term, year, decade, same old
sodding wins — just 'cos they're top of
their division!
IC 4th vs TEXACO 1 (AWAY): 5-4
Now this was magic, defeating the.
second team in the division from 2-4
down. Ho, Josefsson and epecially
P h i l (I'm on a P h D now) W i l s o n
showed how little I'm needed by the
team (except to cause cock-ups!).
IC 2 vs GAINSFORD 4 (7-2)
Continued revival by the seconds
(Tye 2, Blount 2, and Etheridge 3 this
time) puts them in a much happier
position than had s e e m e d likely a
couple of months back (middle of the
table-ish).
IC 4 vs EXILES v (3-6)
This was a cup match (2nd round)
but with me playing, of course we lost.
Pee Aitch Dee won 2 (not bad), lost
one and well, y o u ' v e all got C S E
Maths haven't you?
IC 1 vs GAINSFORD 4: (9-0)
With Kumar back in place of Petey
(Tee, hee), this was an all Asian team,
and look at the result: H o n g and
Kartick were around somewhere.
IC 2 vs HONG KONG S C (3-6)
Success does not mean losing every
set by 2 games to one, that means you
Gary and Phil; Blount showed the way
w i t h t h r e e w i n s . G o d , if R o l a n d
Marslin could see Gary Etheridge he'd
think he was l o o k i n g in a mirror,
smash, oh, I've missed it, smash . . .
oh, done it again, smash, smash . . .
it's bound to work sooner or later . . .
IC 4 vs LAW COURT
First attempt, Hewkin gets wrong
day, nice trip to S t a n d and back.
S e c o n d a t t e m p t , r i g h t d a y ( 5 0 %
success is fair ain't it?). We won by
the same margin as our first encounter
with them, but this time I won two
sets. Max also won two and Wilson.
only won one.
