N U S push for large grant increases - I C U votes
against discussion .... implying that we are happy
with their present level. N o wonder we don't
belong to the N U S . Next v;eek Kings College
London is to hold a referendum on the question of
disaffiliation from the N U S . Those in favour say
that the move is the only way to impress on the
N U S how unhappy many Colleges are with its
performance.
The Express described the N U S demand for a
36 per cent Grant increase as the action of
ignorant louts. After our U G M Imperial students
seem to be at the less ignorant end of the Daily
Express student spectrum. It seems that the good
old Express is getting desperate to try to increase
its student circulation. After the way the Express
trivialised the Ladies Rugby feature I don't expect
it to increase its sales to Imperial students.
Tonight on Sportswide (towards the end of
Nationwide B B C 1) the B B C have a chance to
give their impression of the Ladies Rugby team.
When they filmed the ladies, last Sunday, the
camera team hinted that the film should be shown
tonight • I hope that we won't be disappointed.
The questionnaire has had to be
postponed until next week because, once
again, there have been problems with the
production of FELIX. I would like to
apologise to residents in Beit for depriving
them of 'Top of the Pops'. A fault with the
FELIX equipment blew one of the main fuses
in Beit.
Various sheets from Halls and Houses
were left behind after the Toga party. Also a
pair of ladies gloves and something
indescribable were left in the JCR. Please
collect from Beit Room 79.
I would like to thank Mathew Smith for his
help with the production and artwork that
we used in last weeks FELIX. Margaret and
Jill Dawson also deserve a credit. Jill has
been helping devise questions for next
weeks survey

S Q U A S H — E Y E I N J U R I E S
Recently there were two accidents to people wearing
glasses when they were playing squash. In both cases the
accidents were serious enough to require eye
operations.
The accidents were caused by direct impact of, in the
one case the ball and in the other case, the racquet, with
the spectacles. If people wish to play squash and have to
wear specatacles to do so, they are advised that .
SAFETY SPECTACLES can be bought which will stand'
a high degree of impact.
The Safety Director, Dr G Hargreaves can supply any
information (Room 305, Sherfield, int tele. 2889).
