IC 1st XI vs R F H 1st XI: 3-2
S t e v e V e a t s m a d e a t r i u m p h a n t
return as goalkeeper in the 1st XI on
Saturday. My regular reader (!) will
recall that last time ' H a n d s ' Veats
played, the team won 5-4 with Veats
getting a hat trick . . . for Q M C ! In this
g a m e , h o w e v e r , S t e v e c a u g h t
everything, and the rest of the team were
so surprised that, against their better
instinct they won the game!
IC's confidence grew in the opening
stages as Veats saved a few useful shots.
So much so that a 'Mis Hit' Rickard
corner was controlled by Dave Dean,
whose amazing (for a man of his stature)
turn so astounded the opposition that he
was able to volley IC into a well deserved
lead without them hardly realizing it!
The match was keenly, and cleanly
contested throughout. However, the
referee was forced to book a R F H player
who expressed strong opinions when he
didn't get a free kick after Hendy's late
tackle! Hendy, who had been left out of
his cage minutes before kick off, was
soon in the book after another late
tackle. Unfortunately, R F H were allowed
to e q u a l i s e just b e f o r e h a l f - t i m e ,
following mass brain seizure in the IC
defence.
At half-time, we fed Hendy some raw
meat and decided on new tactics. We
w o u l d start p a s s i n g to e a c h other
instead of to R F H who refused to give
the ball back! These tactics brought
instant success as Stevenson blasted
the ball h o m e after a goal mouth
scramble. Encouraged by being ahead
again, IC took control and only Rowley's
insistance on missing the goal and
Rickard's insistance on passing to their
keeper kept the score at 2-1. Then ten
minutes from the e n d , R F H got a
crippling equaliser.
However, the 1st Xl's new found spirit
refused to be denied. The result was
sealed in the closing minutes when
Rickard's pass to RFH's keeper went
astray and finished up in the goal! The
1st XI were relieved and delighted to win
and credit must go to all for the spirit
shown throughout the game.
Finally, it is sadly noted that the Steve
Veats Appreciation Society is in danger
of being disbanded unless its herd
throws some more shots into the net!
Team: S Veats, J Gamble, M Curran, K
Reeve, C Beer, C Hendy, I Stevenson, A
Donaldson, D Dean, J Rowley and G
Rickard.

A 2nd XI IMPERIAL COLLEGE
FOOTBALL REPORT
On a clear cold Wednesday afternoon,
the 2nd team took to the football field to
handsomely defeat an L S E 2nd XI team
by four goals to one.
The initial well organised L S E side was
overrun gradually by the IC midfield of
Kev Buckley, Phil Niccolls and Brian
Scannell. Clinical finishing by the IC
forwards of whom Dave McPhail, driving
the ball low on each occasion, scored two
goals and Dick Veenman, a low drive and
a volley off a one-two from Phil's mouth,
also scoring two goals consolidated our
position at half-time to 4-0.
In the s e c o n d half L S E a p p l i e d
pressure which was relieved chronically
by sturdy left wing play from Aled
Phillips. However, solid IC defence by
Dec McGukin and Giles Brereton and
Kenny Sansom-like defensive thrusts
from the flanks by Chris Hendy and Jim
Beer foiled all the L S E attacks. The game
finished at 4-1 win for IC 2nds after L S E
scored scored a consolation goal towards
the end of the game.
Before IC returned to College they
dutifully rearranged British Rail Southern
region scheduled service by posing as
management staff and holding up the
train while Ken Buckley relieved himself,
the operation was controlled by the
authoritative voice of Giles Brereton
backed by subtle shouts from Phil
Niccolls of "hurry up Kev, you s . . .
heap."
Team: A Betts, C Hendy, D McGukin,
G * B r e r e t o n , J Beer, K B u c k l e y , P
Niccolls, B Scannell, D McPhail, D
Veenman and A Phillips.

2nds vs Kings: 3—1
2nds Survive Psychological Attack
Kings 2 decided that the only way to
beat IC was to make us over confident
and when only nine Kings players
arrived at Beit Arch on Saturday, the talk
turned to s c o r e s of 10—0, but at
Hariington the Kings plan became clear
as there were the two 'mining' players
and a substitute. IC morale was at a low
ebb especially as the side included the
n e w c o m e r s , the h a m s t r i n g - t r o u b l e
Merrit, some chap called Price and the
totally incompatible Knowles, whose
pre-match talk of the application of
Deep heat to the male organs was
classic.
The 2nds soon settled and soon
noticed the poor offside trap employed
by Kings. Many time lone centre forward
M c P h a i l s h o w e d the finishing that
makes him a natural winger. He did
however shoot one past a heeper left
unprotected by a trap that failed 1-0.
IC dominated a superb ball from
'Cyrille' Knowles over an advancing
defence allowed Niccolls to put the ball
in with his usual style. 2-0. Kings
obtained a penalty and Betts saved to
heep the score at 2-0 until half-time.
In the second half, IC swarmed over
Kings and from a poor clearance to the
edge of the box, Kevin Buckley, the
Laughing Cavalier of the team drove
home to make the score 3-0.
But it was now the constant nagging
of M c G u c k i n unsettled the team and
Kings bounded the ball in after a low
hard cross eluded the bickering Celt.
3-1. Buckley's humour calmed the team
down and for the last five minutes they
swamped the opposition, but with no
further addition to the score, the game
ended with a score of 3-1 taking the 2nds
XI goal tally to 49 for the season.

IC BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER
CLUB
The C team travelled all the way to
R H C and when we got there, we
fought our way through the hordes of
admiring amazons and Dave Nuttall
won yet another match to brilliant
s t o r m b r i n g i n g a p p l a u s e . A l e x a n d e r
Cameron played next and fought off
waves of sheer misery to actually win
his first game.
I p l a y e d next a m i d s t s c e n e s of
hysterical admiration at my new hair
cut and came out on top (not my
hair). Next came the Kelly contribution. •
Having had all my previous comments
about this chap censored and edited, I
shall just say that if this is the best
Ireland can bring up on potatoes, it's
about time they had a famine — he
lost.
Finally, the great (all hail) Graham
Curtis played last against a c h a p
looking like an Afghan terrior (or is it
terrorist?) who, like a scene straight
from Life Of Brian should have been
happy to get away with crucifixion.
So, we won 4-1 altogether (so the C
team are miles above the B team).
The B team played L S E at home and
won 3-2 after being 2-0 down.
O n W e d n e s d a y last, the A team
entertained L S E B team at home. They
cemented their opponents 4-1. This
was not good enough thanks to a
sickening defeat of Shaun Armstrong
who was preoccupied with matters of
getting Edward Kennedy into IRA Soc.
All the others won and the role of
s t a r s is as f o l l o w s (in o r d e r of
i m p o r t a n c e to the w o r l d ) : M a r t i n
Proudlove, feeling a bit white, ham-
mered his opponent (I bet he wishes
he could 'reproduce' his form else-
where); Geoffrey Keymer, who has in
the past sold his body to win snooker
matches (especially doubles, eh Alex!)
had no trouble beating his talentless
partner (I mean all g o o d s n o o k e r
players do physics not economics); Sir
San Teelock an understanding and
whimpering mercenary from the lost
country of Malicious, took on a huge
change of form to actually, if feebly,
win a match (cor you'll deserve them
blues); last was the lone T r i p p , a
snooker player of little importance and
large expendability — he has his days
occasionally, but as a snooker player,
I don't see much hope for him. He
w o n h o w e v e r , with the t r a u m a t i c
commitment of a cleanshaven A y a -
tollah.

IC LADIES vs U C : 2—1
O n Wednesday 16th J a n u a r y , IC
Ladies played a match, rearranged from
last term. It was supposed to be at UC's
ground, but due to frozen pitches, it was
played out at Hariington.
Owing to a slight error by Fay Hood
(ie forgetting the shirts) IC Ladies took
the field in spare Guilds Rugby shirts. It
was in fact a calculated error, because
these shirts turned out to be much
warmer than ours (well, that's my story
and I'm sticking to it!).
