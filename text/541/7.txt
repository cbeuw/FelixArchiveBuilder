Interview with Dave Derby - by the Editor
Dave Derby, the Mirror Dinghy World
Champion, flew back to Imperial earlier
this month. We managed to obtain a
quick interview with Dave after one of his
Civil Engineering exams. The talk was
recorded in the Ennismore and after
filtering out the pub noises and editing the
conversation we ended up with only a few
lines
Dave started sailing five years ago. His
father bought the Mirror Dinghy kit for
himself and he started helming while Dave
was crew. After six months they swapped
over and by the end of the year Dave
decided that his father was "too big, too
slow and too heavy to be crew so I
chucked him out."
However, Dave's father went over to
Perth to help with the attempt to win the
W o r l d C h a m p i o n s h i p . H e was team
manager.
With them was fourteen year old Chris
Bishop who was Dave's crew. Chris
started sailing with Dave last summer
when they won the s o u t h e r n a r e a
championships.
While they were in Australia the team
took part in two championships. The
Australian championship week was first
and Dave sailed two races a day for three
days. The overseas competitors competed
in the event but they couldn't actually win
the Australian title but competed instead for
the Australian International trophy which
Dave won.
/ did my bit
for Britain
In the second week there was racing
alternately in the morning and in the
afternoon. We had three races in the
mornings when we had light winds and
three races in the afternoon with strong
winds. We were lucky enough to win the
practice race and the first five points races
and by the time we came to the last points
race we had already won the champion-
ship. Due to over indulgence on the
Thursday night we only managed to
come third in the last one.
While he was winning the M i r r o r
Dinghy W o r l d C h a m p i o n s h i p , Dave
explained that he had to ration his time in
Australia. He carefully balanced the
pleasures of meeting the local girls —
Sheilas that were magnetically attracted
towards him. Dave explained that he tried
not to over exert himself as he didn't
want to detrimentally affect his chances in
the world championship. "I just kept the '
British flag flying - I did my bit for
Britain.".
The conversation moved on to discussing
the more interesting side of Dave's visit to
Perth but sadly the background noises in
the Ennismore were too loud for us to
transcribe the tape recording at this
point. The conversation turned to the
Olympics.
Dave Derby
The Moscow Olympics clashed with
Dave's finals and so he hadn't considered
preparing for the 1980 Olympics. Four
years from now the games should be held
in Los Angeles and Dave said that there
was an 80% chance that he would try to
be in the Olympics in 1984. "When you
reach Olympic standard you have to
compete in many more foreign regattas
and it's the expense of taking weeks of
time off work and being able to transport
yourself, your crew, boat and gear
overseas, costs of accommodation when
you're there and getting back again.
"You always need to get new gear,
new boats and sails. The most important
part of a saiing boat is its sails - like the
motor of a racing car - no matter how
good the driver of the car is, unless
you've got the best motor . . . the best
sails there's no way that you'll ever do
anything."
There are
63,000 Mirror dinghies
being sailed in the world
Dave was sponsored by the Rector for
£500 and he had help transporting his
boat from Ocean Containers Ltd. Even
with local sponsorship from his home
town of Broadstairs, Dave had to put a
lot of money into the venture. "All the
money that I earned during the summer
working was put towards going to
Australia. My relatives chipped in a bit as
well."
There are over 63,000 Mirror dinghies
being sailed in the world, so there are a
fair number of people who can compete
for places in the championships. " Y o u
have to be selected in order to take part.
In 1979 we won the UK and European
titles and we were chosen along with four
other British competitors including the
defending world champion Roy Partridge.
There were about twenty boats in the
World Championship and over eighty in the
Australian event."
Good luck
in future events!
Dave came sixth in the last World
Championships which were held in Europe
three years ago. After winning this year
Dave has found considerable success at the
age of twenty-one.
If his work allows him to compete in the
Olympic trials and Dave is going to try to
arrange that it does, then we may see Dave
winning even more titles. FELIX wishes
Dave Derby the best of luck.
FOX HUNTING
INFORMATION
This term is going to be the term of the
Questionnaire. I C W A is arming itself with
relevant information with which to debate
its future.
F E L I X is asking lots of questions, some
of which will be about accommodation
(see other part of F E L I X ) , and later on in
t h e t e r m t h e r e w i l l be a p e r s o n a l l y
delivered questionnaire on housing (but
you will find out about that if you are one
of the lucky 10%).
I n f o r m a t i o n , b o t h g a t h e r i n g a n d
disseminating it, is a major and vital job.
H o w can I attend a seminar on accom-
m o d a t i o n if I d o n ' t k n o w w h a t t h e
m a j o r i t y of s t u d e s will a c c e p t ? I c a n
guess! But there must be more accuracy
than that.
Disseminating info can be done through
this c o l u m n ( u s u a l l y bad) or just by
meeting people (except not many of you
stop and ask or tell!).
MEDIA and THINGS
There is to be a recording made of the
News Quiz for Radio 4 next T h u r s d a y ,
(31st), in the U n i o n C o n c e r t Hall. If this is
s u c c e s s f u l t h e r e w i l l b e a f u r t h e r
recording on 21st February, so please
support it. Jonathan K i n g will be there to
boo at. A l a n C o r e n (of Punch) and J e a n
R o o k (of the Daily Express) will be there
too.
T h e L a d i e s R u g b y t e a m has b e e n
receiving considerable coverage in the
media recently. A l m o s t without exception
the reports have trivialised the whole
thing and by reporting it as a novelty
have defeated the object. Nevertheless,
they have done very well and I wish them
all the best.
EDUCATION C U T S C O M M
This met last Thursday and decided to
continue with the petition to E d w a r d Heath.
T h i s is to e n c o u r a g e h i m to l e a d a
backbench revolt on the overseas students
issue. If y o u haven't already signed it, please
do so. There will be an M P lobbying session
at Westminster on 13th February. I a m in
the process of compiling a sheet telling y o u
how to lobby so if you feel strongly y o u can
afford a few hours to lobby (if you can't
make the 13th, then do another date!).
SPIELKRIEG
This is the term when people get d o w n
and work (so I'm told) and sabbaticals
d i s a p p e a r i n t o a m e l e e of e s t i m a t e s ,
elections, and " D r e a m s of Leaving", but it
really is important that c o m m u n i c a t i o n
doesn't break d o w n as on things like this
seminar of a c c o m m o d a t i o n it is vital that the
correct viewpoint is put forward.
TALLY HO!
