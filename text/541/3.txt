K E I T H T I F F A N Y
(1958—1980)
It is with great regret that we have to
announce the death of Keith Tiffany. Keith,
who was twenty-one years old, drowned last
week off the Wilderness Coast, S o u t h
Africa, while swimming with some friends.
Keith had been educated at Allerton
Grange Hill School where he was House
Captain a n d Headboy. H e came to the
Royal School of Mines in 1977 to study
Mineral Technology, a n d h a d been an
excellent academic student, completing two
years in that course. It was for this reason
that he was selected for the award of one
year i n d u s t r i a l w o r k w i t h t h e A n g l o -
American C o m p a n y in South Africa. H e
was due to complete his course at the R S M
in October.
Keith was also a keen sportsman, playing
squash and football for the Royal School of
Mines for two years.
A memorial service will be held in Leeds
later this month.
Our deepest sympathy goes to his mother
and sister.
Requiem In Pace.

The Fencing Club is active on Thursdays from
12:30 to 2:30. The Friday night sessions have been
cancelled but in their place there are twice weekly
forays to Salle Paul in Pimlico {there is transport). So
if you think you need extra lessons come along to the
Gym at 5:30pm on Mondays and Wednesdays,
bringing the usual gear, ie tracksuit and training
shoes. Beginners still most welcome.
Things are looking quite healthy now with regards
to equipment, ever since our generous major claims
award and team morale is very high since our
victories against Q E C and Ealing College at the end
of last term. This term should see sabre and epee
more in evidence at matches.

The General Committee met for the
first time this term o n Tuesday, despite
being a long drawn out affair, it did fulfil
its task of looking after the management
of R C S . There were, however, noticeably
few social representatives present as was
the case at the first Carnival Committee
this term. Obviously this is not a good
, state of affairs. Social representatives are
elected by their peers to sit o n both these
committees a n d if they don't turn up they
are not fulfilling their responsibilities to
the people w h o elected them.
E l e c t i o n s a r e t o p i c a l ! W h y ? Issues
forths a plaintive c r y from the depths of
the B o t / Z o o C o m m o n room. T h e simple
answer is that o n Saturday 16th February
papers will be put up for next year's
P r e s i d e n t , V i c e P r e s i d e n t , H o n o r a r y
Secretary, H o n o r a r y J u n i o r T r e a s u r e r
and Academic Affairs Officer. This is only
four w e e k s a w a y a n d n e e d s s e r i o u s
consideration soon both by would be
candidates a n d voters.
These elections are perhaps of least
importance to the third years, so here's
something just for them. Each year R C S A
organises sherry parties for third year
members of R C S a n d the dates this year
are: Tuesday 19th February for Maths
and Physics; a n d Thursday 6th M a r c h for
Chemistry a n d Life Sciences. B o t h will
take place at 6:00pm in Southside S C R .
As mentioned in last week's F E L I X the
R C S soccer sixes take place o n Sunday.
The coach leaves for Hariington from Beit
A r c h at 12:30pm. Also mentioned was the
Ents night out, although the destination is
a surprise, the meeting place will be the
'Cockney Pride' at 5:30pm. T h e tickets
will be got o n the student standby system
so please remember to bring your union
card.
