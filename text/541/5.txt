A career in chartered
raccountancy is indeed open
ended, but only to those who
start it with clarity and
determination. It can make
you a local or international
professional. It can make you
a specialist or a generalist. It
can make you an adviser, a
problem-solver, a trouble-
shooter or a local community
leader. But successful
accountants are realists as
^rell as imaginative. They

WIST
Why are there so few women studying science
subjects?
In girls schools the numbers studying science
and arts subjects are often equal, but the
numbers of girls doing science in a mixed school
is often much smaller than those doing arts. Also,
in further education the proportion of girls doing
science to those doing arts is very low. Why is
this so?
Are girls actually less capable of studying
science than boys or have they just been
conditioned to believe that they are? Is science
taught in a 'masculine' way?
Where does this sexist bias begin? At home:
where boys are often encouraged to do such
things as play with meccano and help with
baking etc. How much do parents influence their
children's choice of subjects at school by telling
girls they would never be able Jp get a job if they
did science at school etc. Do teachers ever
discriminate against girls? Is enough careers
advice available and is it sexist?
We are attempting to write a paper for a
conference on 'Science Education For Women'
and would appreciate any help.
If you feel you can help us answer these
questions or have any ideas on the subject please
come along to an informal discussion in the
ICWA Lounge on Wednesday 30th January at
12:45pm.
Other WIST meetings this term include: 6th

MORRIS MINERS
A N D S C I E N T I S T S A N D G U I L D S M E N ,
Take my word for it. Not many moons
must pass before once again, verdant hues
abound throughout this otherwise already
pleasant land (and in certain corners of
Princes Gardens) and birds and bees go at
it like good 'uns. The gentlefolk of the
esteemed division of Lift Sciences, when
pressed upon the subject, no doubt to* tbn
official line and come forth with much
concerning biological cycles and tempera-
ture ranges, but the wise man-in-the-bar is
not fooled. He knows that the countryside's
changing aspect is brought about largely
by a c o n c e r t e d c a m p a i g n to w a k e u p
Mother Earth and frighten away Evil Spirits
by those august and invaluable pillars of
the agricultural economy, the Morris m e n
of the particular locality. A n d it is to
improve the South Kensington Farmer's lot
that Folk Club shall be holding a Beginners'
Morris Dance Workshop o n the evening of
Monday 28th January.
Until the changing social conditions of
the 19th Century, most rural communities
had a men's ritual dance team, membership
of w h i c h w a s a m u c h p r i z e d h o n o u r .
Perhaps the most highly refined styles were
to be found in the villages of the Cotswolds
and it is dances from this area which are
by far the most frequently performed by
today's 'revival' sides. Bledington, on the
b o r d e r b e t w e e n G l o u c e s t e r s h i r e a n d
O x f o r d s h i r e will provide the d a n c e s to
make up Monday's workshop.
It is impossible that anyone attending ill
receive more than a cursory introduction to
the a r t : t h e r e a r e m a n y h u n d r e d s of
traditional dances known. Perhaps it may
spur someone on to join a side: at least I
think it will increase your appreciation of
the tradition.
By the way, does anyone know a reliable
source of stout sticks?
