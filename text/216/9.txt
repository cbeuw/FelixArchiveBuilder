The Carnival Raffle
Dear Sir,
Yearly, at this time, each undergraduate is given two books of
Carnival Raffle Tickets to sell, postgraduates being given one book.
Last year, when I was selling them, a prospective buyer asked
me what guarantee he had that the counterfoils of his tickets would
actually go into the draw. In all honesty, I could only tell him that
there was no guarantee, it depending solely on the integrity of the
student selling them. This did not deter him from purchasing some
however, although he did not know me.
Nevertheless, it is still a valid point. There is nothing to stop
a student from selling his tickets, throwing away the counterfoils, and
keeping the money. It may be argued that the majority of students
are honest, and I sincerely hope and believe that this is so. Since,
however, many students stoop to taking copies of Felix without paying
for them, and quite happily cheat the Post Office telephone service, and
London Transport, my faith in students' honesty is perhaps rather
naive.
I appreciate that it must have been quite a job just to distribute
books of tickets, and that to check up on the whereabouts of every
book distributed, prior to the draw, would strain the organizers' re-
sources of manpower to the limit, and might even be impossible.
Despite this, I feel strongly that the slapdash method of previous
years is hardly ethical, and hope that some sort of check will be made
this year. Since I am creating such a fuss about it, I will be pleased
to help those checking the counterfoils, but it is perhaps too late;—
perhaps no note was made of who got which twenty tickets?
Incidentally, what has happened to the one ticket free, given to
each student selling a whole book, that has been a feature of previous
years?
Yours faithfully,
MELVYN OWEN, (3.E.E.)
Dear'Sir,
In reply to Mr. Owen's letter in this edition of Felix, we would
like to make the following points in defence of the present, apparently
lax, system of raffle ticket distribution and collection.
The organisers do make a note of all cash and counterfoils and
unsold tickets returned. Hence, knowing that each undergraduate
receives two books and each postgraduate one book, we do have a
check on tickets returned. There seems to be no more efficient method
of dealing with the problem and there is little point in recording indi-
vidual ticket numbers—a mammoth task where 90,000 raffle tickets,
about 4,000 students and academic staff (and perhaps a further 1,500
hon-academic staff) are concerned. Numbers on raffle tickets are
merely to distinguish one from another in the draw.
We do, however, accept your point that much depends on the
integrity of the individual, but we trust that where someone is collect-
ing money for a charity they will not packet that money. One cannot
distrust everyone all the timel
As for the free ticket—thai is illegal]
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,
The inevitable Extraordinary
General Meeting of I.C. Union
has been called in an attempt to
reverse the decision taken at the
last Union meeting to affiliate to
N.U.S. Since the meeting is to
take place at the end of term,
there is a strong possibility that
the meeting might be inquorate.
This must not happen since
then the issue will hang fire until
it can be properly debated at a
quorate meeting. As there are no
General Studies next term and
consequently no two-hour lunch
break, this is unlikely until the
start of the next session; a delay
which can only do harm to the
Union.
To ensure that we join N.U.S.,
the motion to disaffiliate must be
soundly defeated after full discus-
sion. Only then will the decision
carry the full weight of opinion of
the College, rather than a single
pressure group.
I therefore ask all who voted
tor affiliation at the last meeting
to come and vote again (and to
bring that friend who meant to
come but didn't think it was worth
going); thus reiterating this deci-
sion of the Union to at last affi-
liate to N.U.S.
Yours faithfully,
MIKE EDWARDS
Dear Sir,
There is a further point nobody
has yet mentioned against the mis-
use of letter racks for society no-
tices and unaddressed circulars. I
believe that many other post-
graduates, especially those from
overseas, have the same feeling
as I in this .
In the few years I am planning
to stay in this country, the only
permanent address I can use while
at this College is my departmental
address. This I have to use not
only in my private corresponden-
ces, but in official communications
as well. Then any correspondence
connected with my research work
is of course again through the
department. These letter racks
are the places I collect my letters
and they are already serving a
rough estimate of 400 students.
(All first year engineering students
in addition to second, third year
and P.G. mechanical engineering
^students use • the same racks.)
This latter point may be due to a
Bad arrangement of the depart-
ment, but I sincerely hope the stu-
dents themselves can helt> keep
them in proper use. Can the
eager committee members of the
societies consider this point when
planning their publicity?
Yours faithfully,
JOHN CHEUNG
