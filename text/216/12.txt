CARNIVAL LOSS
JLC.S. made a £15—£20 loss
on their carnival held on Friday,
5th March, Dick Smith (Chair-
man R.C.S. Ents.) reported to
the R.C.S. General Committee on
Tuesday, 16th March. The main
raason was the very poor response
ia tickets sales—only 170, were
sold as compared with the 230
for the Guilds-Mines Carnival
last term.
Dick Smith was doubtful
whether the Carnival had been
worth all the effort that had been
put into it. He also thought that
one carnival shared between the
three Constituent Colleges would
be adequate.
Jo Collins Chairman C. & G.
Events holds the opposite opinion.
He cannot understand why R.C.S.
lost for the Guilds-Mines Carnival
broke even. He did say, however,
that next year the Guilds-Mines
Carnival might be completely dif-
ferent.
Both Messrs Collins & Smith
suggest that many students may
not know what a Carnival is. A
Carnival is an extended hop last-
ing through the early hours, with
a Cabaret, Buffet and Licenced
bar until 2.00 a.m. It is also used
to distort the " reasonable hour "
rule for visitors to leave Hall.—

A student was caught stealing
money recently from a Sennet
sales tin by a security guard. The
offender, however, gave a false
name. Jock Henry, the chief se-
curity officer, is looking into the
theft.

Dream
Dr. Brown is to be congratu-
lated on an impressive and mov-
ing interpretation of Elgar's
" The Dream of Gerontius " per-
formed at R.C.M. last Thursday.
Martyn Hill's fine tenor voice
did more than justice to the de-
manding role of Gerontius, and
he was ably supported by Hugh
Sherrihan and Lesley Wood.
Perhaps most pleasing was the
fine performance of the 130
strong I.C. Choir, especially in
their rendering of the Devil's
chorus. Their modulation
throughout was commendable,
and the tenor section at last seems
to have found its feet.
Those who sat patiently
through the meanderings of the
Iolanthe Orchestra, and were ex-
pecting the same treatment here,
must have had a very pleasant
surprise. The standard of play
was professional throughout,
overzealous stringing, never
drowning the soloists.
The near capacity audience in-
dicated their appreciation by loud
and prolonged applause, and it
seems a pity that these occasions
are limited to "one night stands."
A D R I A N FLETCHER.
19th May. Tickets will be 25/-
double. Musicians: Brian Green
and his New Orleans Stampers.

Radio Tizard accidently trans-
mitted a programme on 600
metres Medium Wave on Tues-
day, 16th March. The reason
was a faulty amplifier borrowed
from the Electrical Engineering
Dept.
Another extension at Hariing-
ton will provide a flat for the sup-
groundsman, more tea facilities
and more washing space.

in the Sir Arthur Acland Essay
Competition was 25 guineas. It is,
in fact, 1$ guineas.

SANDWICH
What are you doing this long
vac? Working ? Good, but you
can't do that for three months;
you've just got to have a holiday
some time. But it can be boring
lying on a beach doing nothing
for a couple of weeks and travel-
ling is expensive.
The Opera Group invites you
to come on the best of all holi-
days. On our summer tour to
Folkstone and Bristol we are per-
forming the " MIKADO," one of
Gilbert & Sullivan's best operas
and when we're not performing
there will be time for lying on the
beach or walking on the Downs or
in Wales.
Travel will be subsidized to
Folkestone, Bristol and back to
London, and there's the added
attraction of female company. If
you think you can sing and would
like to come—between July 16th
and August 1st drop a line to
Chris Hocking^ Jack Hopkins, or
Harry Epton via the Union Rack.
Oh yes, the sandwich men will be
advertising on the prom, at Folke-
stone!

L.S,E. PETITION
A petition has been presented
to the U.G.C. and L.S.E. authori-
ties by the students. It complains
of overcrowding in the libraries,
refectories, bars and lecture thea-
tres and calls for more lockers,
lavatories, telephones, cloak-
rooms and common rooms.
BEER TASTING
Sussex University held a beer
tasting session recently to decide
whether to haveTamplin's, Youn-

LIFE IN ANGLIA
Among the weird regulations of
the University of Anglia are hav-
ing to pay for all evening meals
for a term in advance to encourage
students to stay in college in the
evenings, and having to obtain
permission from tutors to leave
Norwich even for just one night.
BAR BRAWL AT READING
Two students have been banned
from the Union at Reading after
an incident in the Union Bar. One
of them objected to a remark
made by the other about a female
friend of his and a violent struggle
ensued. ,
WAREHOUSE SURVEY
Despite Brother Brown's eco-
nomy drive the really important
research is still going on. A grant
of £6,850 has just been awarded
to Newcastle University for re-
search "into the distribution of
Warehouses in the North East."
CRUEL SPORTS FLOP
When the Curate of Colches-
ter's Museum of Natural History
turned up to speak to Essex Uni-
versity's Anti-Blood Sports Asso-
ciation he had an audience of one
of the society's seventy members.
Not even the president of this
allegedly thriving " Anti-" club
turned up.
SEDUCTION OF STUDENTS
The Dean of Women Students
at Stanford University (U.S.A.)
has resigned after accusing Pro-
fessors of English of seducing
women students " by deliberately
concentrating on sexual aspects of

CARDIFF SINGING
The Cardiff University Rugby

WELSH SECEDE FROM

The Students Association of

NOT QUITE LAST
Despite allegations in "Beaver"
that the contents of this column
were stale, things are not as bad
as in " King's News." A recent
edition included material (on the
banning of Southampton's Rag
Week next year) which was re-
ported in this column last term.
S.C.C.
(From p. 1)
took issue on almost every point;
he did admit, however, that he
might be incompetent.
There followed a whole series
of arguments, between Reich and
Anand, which were petty in the
extreme and served no useful
purpose.
The majority of the Committee
appeared thankful when the
motion was finally put to the
vote. It was carried 12 for, 2
against, with 6 abstentions.
Other items of interest from the
meeting were the approval of
I.C.S.F.R.E. as a member of
S.C.C. and a £20 grant to the
Indian Society for guests at their
annual dinner.

News.)

session and was not on the Student
