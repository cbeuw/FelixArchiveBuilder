FELIX i i
Rifle Fives

13th March. The detailed results
are not yet known but L C . ap-
pear to have virtually swept the
board.
The 1st team retained the Uni-

50 and 100 yards), and an I.C.
team of 3 won the Sharpshooter
competition (breaking 2 clay discs
at 100 yards).
In individual competitions R.
D. Kennett won the University

pionship and D. H . Davies was
2nd. V . Coombs and I. P. Free-
man were 2nd and 3rd respec-
tively in the S. and K . Champion-

J. M . Edmond won Div. 2, LP.

be equally successful in full-bore
shooting during the summer.

With the defeat in the U.L.

2nd TEAM LOSE
LC. 1—2 Battersea
It was against all expectations
when I.C. lost to Battersea at
Motspur Park in the University of
London Reserves Cup. The ball
playing inside-forwards of L C .
did not come up to standard and
as a consequence could not pierce
a tightly packed defence. Crisp
and Smart seemed lethargic in
comparison with previous rounds
and even Kemp was not his usual
self.
The game was very even until
half-time when the score was nil
each. After the restart with I.C.
playing up the slope Battersea at
last broke through the College
rearguard. The I.C. defence
had to withstand tremendous pres-
sure hereabouts and the fact that
only one goal was scored was a
credit to them. Kemp equalised
for I.C. five minutes from the end
when the Battersea goalkeeper
fumbled with the ball and allowed
the centre-forward to score.
The game went into extra time
and after a hotly disputed corner,
the Battersea centre-forward was
allowed to head the ball home.
From then on I.C. made. little
headway and with the forwards
looking unlikely to score Batter-
sea ran out worthy winners.
scored more points. Thus, with
luck, a tally of over 800 points
is possible.
A few changes have been made
in the team due to injuries and
retirements, "fformer ffagins,"
Williams and Stabler, and occa-
sionally Richards are back in play
again.' Topliss, fflouting the ac-
cepted team etiquette by bringing
a woman to watch twice, learnt
his lesson well: —on both occas-
sions he Was injured and has now
retired to be nursed by his ffemme
ffatale.
Perhaps if more thought and
consideration had gone into the
game before the kick-off then the
story might have been different,
but as it was Battersea seemed to
have more method than a disap-
pointing I.C. side.
Rowing
I.C. Win
U.L. Head
By D . Pollard
Wednesday, 12th March
The results of the Boat Club's
winter training and technique
coaching became evident this
afternoon when the 1st VIII beat
Tyrian B.C. (the U.L. 2nd VIII)
in the U . L . Trial Head of the
river race. This was driven home
even further by the 2riti y HI who
finished 3rd on overall placing,
only 2 sees behind the Tyrian
crew. • I
This is the first time* that an
LC. crew has actually beaten the
Tyrian crew in this event, al-
though the I.C. VHI has won the
Dixon Bowl for the fastest college
crew ever since the race was
started.
Results: —
1. I.C. 1st 19.51
2. Tyrian B.C. 20.00
3. LC. 2nd 20.02
6. LC. 4th 2038
11. L C . 5th 21.26
17. LC. Old Lags 21.54
20. I.C. 6th 22.14
This followed a very successful
outing on the Tuesday, when I.C.
1st VIII paced the Oxford Univ.
crew for the last 1£ miles of their
trial course; and another good
performance was in the Reading
Head of the river where the 1st
V f l l finished 14th. equal and tied
for the junior-senior pennant.
By Ian Collins
A month ago L C lost a fives
match against U.C./U.C.H. by
74 pts. to 73. On the strength of
this close and enjoyable game a
return fixture was arranged. The
tryst was set for " shrove Thurs-
day " the 4th-March.
Late injury forced David Mc-
Bain to withdraw, probably for
the rest of the season, and so I.C.
played with only 3 men, which
meant more play and less rest for
those 3. Such stiffer conditions
can be an advantage as long as
the overloaded players are fit,
since it cuts down the period of
waiting between games, during
which concentration and touch
can be lost.
As in the previous meeting, the
I.C. composite strings found one
U.C. string slightly stronger, the
other slightly weaker than them-
selves.
At no time during the evening
were the colleges more than 6
points apart, and at the start of
the last set, LC. led by 6 points,
but the lead just couldn't be main-
tained. The final scores were a
win for U.C./U.C.H. by 74 pts.
to 72 pts., 4 games each.
Another Defeat
I.C. were comprehensively
beaten on Saturday 13th March at
the Bank of England's courts in
Roebampton. The Bank strings
have just returned from a success-
ful tour in the South West, and
they weren't at all extended in
giving I.C. their heaviest defeat to
date by 120 points to 42 and 8
games to nil.
Lawn Tennis
By E . C. Sones
At the beginning of next term
Imperial College Lawn Tennis
Club starts operating in full force.
As the holders of the U.L.U. Cup,
I.C. have a very high standard to
maintain, but with four out of last
year's 1st VI still at college the
task should not be impossible.
Throughout the summer term
I.C. will be arranging matches for
1st and 2nd teams, with free
coaching for all members and
plenty of court space 'for the
casual players.
As an added incentive a tour
to the South of France has been
organised for the summer. Thus
if you enjoy a game of tennis join
the I.C. tennis club to ensure
plenty of games with people of
your own standard, plus free
coaching. Also the subscription
is less than you would pay for
i hrs. coaching at-any tennis club.
On Saturday 20th March the 1st
VHI paced Cambridge on a trial
course and the following Saturday
(27th.) the six I.C. crews will be
competing against over 300 others
in the Tideway Head of the river
race.
