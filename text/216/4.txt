The last Union Meeting was
brief, and the agenda was mainly
composed of progress reports.
But, for once, this was not
brevity through apathy, but keen-
ness. At 1.15 p.m. the meeting
adjourned to the Albert Mem-
orial, where the first clue in the
Field Cup Race was given by
Chris Molam.
The five departments set out
across the park in search of the
first object. The objects proved
to be a set of tyres, scaffolding
poles and dustbins.
The Race was judged to have
been well won by Civil En-
gineers, who went hot-footed to a
lecture, still clutching the victors'
bottles of beer,—and the crate.

The first two parts are of a
high standard. The final part is
proving difficult to shoot, for in
order to film slow-motion scenes,
many lumens are required, and
these are not forthcoming.
However, Mr. Molam will doubt-
less take the plunge before the
end of the term
R.C.S. C A R N I V A L
A good turn-out of fancy dress, from pirate and grass skirts to
American tourists, greeted the West Indian r eel band. Films were
shown all night; some excellent new groups and the cabaret seem to
have met with approval. Well done, Dick Smith and the Ents. Com-
mittee, and well done, Adrian Fletcher and the cabaret cast! Those
two cowboys did have the right tickets.
R.C.S. DINNER
Surprisingly enough this is the first time a dinner for the whole
R.C.S. has been tried. It will be held on the first Friday of next term,
30th April. This could well become the big event in the Union
Calendar, with distinguished guests, if all goes well. The cost will
be XI, but it won't be collected till next term. Lists are up, so please
sign them before the end of term.
ATHLETIC SPORTS
The inter-college sports are soon after the beginning of next term,
With our long cross-country season, distance running is usually
strong but the short track season just before the exams means that
any sprinters or field events people would probably be welcome. So
contact Derek Wade, Botany Dept., if you were a reasonable school
athlete, but haven't done any at college. I hear Needham is train-
ing for the tug-of-war by pulling his bed up and down the room.
N E X T Y E A R
On a number of evenings at the end of February and beginning
of March, dismayed Londoners saw a varied assortment of young
men driving a pedal car between the post office and South Kensington
Underground station by way of the tunnel. These young RCS men
were training for the 24-hour pedal car race which started on Friday,
5th March, at Bristol. They succeeded in gaining 12th place overall,
and 3rd in their class.
The car had been designed on the basis of last year's handicap
formula, with 12-inch wheels. But, just before the start of the race,
the organisers decided against using this handicap system, and
" Jezette" was placed into class II (11-—15-inch diameter wheels).
Being early arrivals at Bristol, As evening approached the car
the RCS team was able to choose (No. 16) settled into 12th place,
the best pit site, and then they
helped to clear the snow in front
of the pits. But, in spite of their
efforts, the track was still icy at
the start of the race at 12.38 when
Mr. Reginald Maudling, the
Conservative MP, dropped the
starting flag.
Early in the race, Jezette was
lapping in 1 min, 33 sees., with
drivers changing every lap. A
collision on the second lap
loosened the car's right-hand
front-wheel bearing, but the
wheel never collapsed though the
bearing mounting was elliptical
at the end of the race.
against the formidable opposition
of 20 m.p.h. 18-inch wheelers,
dragging to lap times of two
minutes between 3 and 4 a.m.
The bright Saturday dawn and
good breakfast raised the team's
morale, so that by the time Presi-
dent Kish Sadhvani had arrived,
with his eleven buccaneers,
straight from the RCS Carnival,
lap times had reached an all-time
low of 1 min. 20 sees. Added in-
centive came from car 15, only
half-a-lap ahead.
Only 44 cars out of the original
54 crossed the finishing line at
12.38 on Saturday.
GENTLEMEN OF MINES
Who's for president', C. S. EVANS.
An air of tension and excite-
ment prevailed in the packed
Union meeting held on Tuesday,
16th March. It was time once
again for the annual election of
next year's executive and officers.
The executive posts were hotly
contested, the calibre of all the
nominees being high, as shown in
the speeches from the respective
proposers. The chosen executive
elect is as follows:—
Dick (Goalie) Gash—President.
Dick (Mr. I.C.W.A.) Potts—
Vice-President.
Mike (Ents.) Gibson—Hon.
Secretary.
This is a strong executive and
should really push Mines to the
fore-front next year in all fields.
The other officers elected can
be relied upon to continue to
kindle the traditional spirit pf
Mines.
The President, Des Kearns con-
gratulated the captains and teams
for thejr outstanding achieve-
ments: —
r
-
The Rifle Club on winning the
Courtman Shield.
The Hockey Club on winning the
Stephenson Cup.
The Rugby Club- on locating,
Paris School of Mines and
R.C.S.
The Swimming and Water Polo
Club on coming a close second
in the Gala.
The Debating team in beating
R.C.S. so strongly.
Left over from the Clementine
Auction, a typewriter and several
other interesting articles remain,
which are likely to draw some
hard bargaining. The second year
mining have already started sav-
ing.
The changes in constitution
have again been passed at an
extraordinary General meeting.
R U G B Y —
MINES 16, R.CS. 0
A really convincing win. On
this showing Mines are certain tc
win the cup outright. R.C.S.
although not particularly strong in
the forwards had the whole I.C.
first team threequarter line. Mines
more than matched them, as the
result shows, in good open rugby.
Our backs were steady, Snagger
Turner and Ginger Reilly
playing very well, as was expected,
in the back row, while Stew
Green and Pete Ray put some
tough fighting spirit into the
scrum. Mitch Davies, as scrum
half, gave a good display and
quite a few points are due to his
cunning.
The team as a whole are a top
form—so Guilds, W A T C H OUT
