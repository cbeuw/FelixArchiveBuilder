UNION - FINANCES GOOD
Much of the business at the
Council Meeting on 13th March
was purely financial. The report
of the Joint College/Union Study
Group on the Union's Reserve
Fund was approved. This reserve
fund is adequate to meet the ex-
penses of renewing furnishings
and equipment, but needs to be
increased substantially as the
areas under Union control in-
crease.
MONEY VULTURES
Dr. Weale, Hon. Treasurer,
commented on the present satis-
factory state of the finances, and
then the vultures descended to
get what they could.
The R.C.C. wanted £160 to en-
able the G. & S. Society to make
a summer tour to Folkestone
and Bristol. If they manage to
fill all the seats they should bring
back a profit—so a wet summer
can bring benefits to I.C. Union!
The Ents. Committee was
granted extra money for guests at
the May Ball and the Tours Sub-
committee was allocated a further
£50.
SILWOOD SILVER
Down at Silwood an audit of
the refectory accounts had re-
vealed a profit of over .£2,000
accumulated over several years.
Most of the money will be spent
on facilities for the Silwood resi-
dents, such as washing machines
and locks on doors. However
£350 will be spent on silver cutlery
for the Silwood Park Dinners-in-
Hall,—of which there are but two
a year!!
On the Athletic front: Mr.
Jenkins—the Chief Sport—com-
piained about mis-use of the gym
on dance nights and evenings of
formal functions. The beer con-
sumption at Harlington has risen
by 40 per cent.
Council was warned that the
Touchstone weekends are in dan-
Electronic engineers, designers, system planners and
manufacturers of aeronautical, broadcasting,
communications and maritime radio equipment,
television, radar and navigational aids
on land, at sea and in the air.

ger of death by apathy. Two have
been cancelled already this year
and only 15 people attended the
last one.
CORRIDOR HALLS
Duncan Moore reported the
results of his survey on types of
Halls. Nearly 100 per cent, of
those who replied preferred the
Weeks (corridor) type to the
Southside (staircase) type. Coun-
cil sent Mr. Moore and Mr. Price
hot foot to the planning Office.
N.U.S. was mentioned only
briefly, Council approved the
executive recommendation that,
for this year only, we will send
five delegates to the Easter Coun-
cil, two of whom shall be execu-
tive committee members. Ex-
penses will be paid by the I.C.
Union.
UNION HANDBOOK
Mr. Tye proposed that the
Union should publish a Year
Bor>k which would be available
free to all those who wanted a
copy. The blue-book will be re-
tained in its present form. A
likely editor has been found.
Council unanimously approved
the proposal.
Council also engaged in its fa-
vourite sport of setting up working
parties. Messrs. Utting, Cox
and Mair were elected to investi-
gate post-graduate problems.
This proposal was only just ap-
proved; some members argued
against it on the grounds that
most P.G.'s would not be inte-
rested if anyone cared about them
or not.
EARLY RISE
Council finished before 8.00
p.m. which is something of a
record. In the two hour session
much ground was covered under
the efficient Chairmanship of Mr.
Price—whose main fault is to use
the gavel rather like a frenzied
fbck-group drummer.
Before the close Council de-
plored the non-attendance of
three members and early depar-
ture of five others. Among the
early leavers were Messrs. Bishop
and Sadhvani—to dinners. Since
the executive committee, on
which they sit, fixes the date of
Council mee*ings some foresight
on their behalf could have pre-
vented this. Several members pre-
sent might just as well have
stayed away for all that they con-
tributed to the proceedings.
If the present restrictions of
two from each college were re-
moved from the six members
elected by the LC. floor I feel
Council would benefit because
the Union would (ideally) elect
the six most interested people
who are not necessarily equally
divided between colleges.
