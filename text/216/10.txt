Gliding
By M . C. Wooldridge
This June the World Gliding
Championships are being held at
South Terney in Gloucestershire.
Though no I.C. students will be
flying in the championships the
club will be well represented in
other ways since the Club's single
seater " Skylark 4," together with
van, trailer and I.C. driver, is
being hired out to the Finnish
team.
Club Captain, Bill Bailey, also
hopes to do well out of the
Champ's since he is crewing for
the Irish team. After the cham-
pionships are'over a party of I.C.
members and gliders will be set-
ting out on an expedition to
Austria for some mountain soar-
ing.
Between now and the above
events .there will be the usual
gliding at Lasham, including two,
week-long courses for dual and
solo pilots at Easter. The Club
has already done some soaring
this year. Last week-end (March
6th/7th) the woods around La-
sham proved to be warmer than
the surrounding snow-covered
fields and hence gave rise to
" thermals." Several club mem-
bers stayed up for at least an
hour.
If any readers would like to
come and see what gliding is all
about, they would be welcome at
Lasham. (A joy-ride in the
"Eagle" costs approximately 9/-).
I.C. Cricket Club would like
to announce that Freshers' and
Seniors' trials lists are up on the
notice board.
AH those interested in playing
should sign these lists. Trials
28th at Hariington.
Rugby
PARIS MEETS
VON SPIERO
Friday 12th March saw I.C.
Von Spiero's X V on their way to
Paris to pit rugby skill against the
University. After being met at
the station by University officials,
the night was spent in the Ecole
des Mines..
Saturday morning brought
mixed feelings, and the team set
out for the University Club
ground. On arrival it was found
that the game was to be played in
a first-class stadium. Then, when
the I.C. team realised that the
opposition was the mighty P.U.C.
4th X V , bricks appeared in pro-
fusion.
HARD WORK
The game was nard, the I.C.
team taking a long time to settle
down—hence the half-time score
of 3-10. After the interval, how-
ever, Von Spiero'sXV found their
usual form, fast open rugby en-
suing. Total effort by all Spiero's
brought the score to 19-19, this
being the final result.
Rugby
Turner
The 1964-65 rugby season can
be summed up by the phrase " so
near and yet so far."
The club was on the verge of
regaining supremacy in the Gut-
teridge Cup and also having one
of the best playing records for de-
cades. The fate of both these
ventures, however, came to an
abrupt halt that fresh spring day
when Q.M.C.'s penalty kick sailed
between the posts, up until then
the club had had a tremendous
season as the record of 19 wins in
24 games had shown. Not only
had the 1st team been winning but
itjiad been scoring many points
and conceding few. The Wednes-
day record read 230 for-17 against
in 11 matches. Crushing victories
over Wasps, Vandalls (the first
time in 13 years) Kings College
Hospital, and Sandhurst had
proved beyond doubt that I.C.
had a team with immense poten-
tial.
It was not therefore, without
justification, that I.C. took the
field against Q.M.C., confident of
victory. A l l dreams, however,
were shattered in a fatal 8 minutes
in the second half. When Q.M.C.
fought back to take the lead,
which they held to the end.
urns Up
After the cup a lethargy set in;
the number in the defeats column
doubled while only a solitary vic-
tory was recorded. Even in defeat-
however, I.C. were never dis-
graced, never conceding more
than two tries and never losing
by mo e than 8 points.
Good Name
Restored
Perhaps people will say
the Ru jby Club has failed again
this year. This I can say with
great conviction is untrue as I
can speak for the 1st team when
I say we have thoroughly en-
joyed the season and the good
name of Imperial College Rugby
Club has been sown over pre-
viously barren ground.
Finally, I would just like to
say a word of thanks to all the
players and officials of the club
who have backed me to the hilt
in everything I've done. All in
all the club and I have had a suc-
cessful year.—THANKS.
M . Turner,
Captain I.C.R.F.C.
