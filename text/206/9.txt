COUNTRY
CLUB
Do you want a sport that gives
you real satisfaction, companion-
ship and interest? Of course you
do, and you'll find it in the Gross
Country Club. Cross country
does not need any specially
learned skills or tricks, your
efforts cannot be ruined by some-
one else's bad play—it is just
honest, man-to-man guts and de-
termination that wins. And it
is always the best man that does
win in this sport.
T B A L L
On behalf of the soccer club I would like to welcome the
Freshers to I.C. We cater for footballers of all standards, and those
wishing to join the club will find our stall in the concert hall at the
Freshers reception.
We run nine teams ; the first seven play in the U.L.U. league
and have full, and very good fixture lists. The 1st XI play in quite
a good standard, and two or three players are required to fill impor-
tant positions.
I.C. has won the U.L.U. cup five times in the last six seasons,
and were beaten finalists last season. Although our league results
have not been very encouraging during the last two seasons, we are
hoping for better results this season.
There will be training for all 1st X I players, and all others
wishing to attend, on Tuesdays, and Thursdays. I wish you all a
successful stay at I.C.
IC TEN PIN BOWLING CLUB
Have you been bitten by the
ten pin bug!
For all addicts and novices we
run leagues on Wednesday after-
noons and one evening in the
week at 2s. a game.
Games may also be played at
this cheap rate on production of
our membership card at East
Acton Bowl on weekdays before
6 p.m. See us at our stall on
Freshers Day, or contact R. J.
Kirk, Physics III, via Physics or
Union Rack.
L A W N TENNIS CLUB
This club offers opportunities
for members to play tennis
throughout the year. Enthusiasts
may play in the winter for one of
the constituent college teams, and
during the summer there are two
I.C. teams. It is hoped to organise
a winter singles tournament. The
club has two tarmac courts in
Princes Gdns. and several grass
courts at Harlington.
Members of I.C. Lawn Tennis
Club, automatically become a
a member of their constituent col-
lege club.
RIFLE C L U B
Small-bore and full-bore target
shooting? I.C. Rifle Club has
opportunities for both. We have
rifles and all other necessary
equipment for .22 shooting and
last year we had to use the OTC
range at Russell Square, Extensive
efforts are now going on to try to
find a nearer range.
A range is being built as part of
the new Sports Centre in Princes
Gardens which could be ready
some time.
Last year several of the mem-
bers shot regularly for the univer-
sity and our several teams won
many events in the University
leagues of Championship.
Three teams shoot regularly in
the University leagues giving op-
portunities for everybody from
the best shot to the novice who
has not held a rifle before.
There will be trips for full-bore
shooting to Bisley during the first
few weeks of this term, so join the
club and watch the notice board.

I.C.C.C.C. must be, for its size,
one of the busiest clubs in the col-
lege; we race twice a week and on
many days there is even a choice
of matches, there ars trips to
Cardiff, Exeter, Oxford, Brighton
and Reading. Among the many
big championships that we enter
is the Hyde Park Relay which we
organise and involves teams from
every University or Training col-
lege all over the British Isles.
This is an event we have won
twice and rearely been lower than
6th, we have often been winners
of the U.L. Leagues and Cham-
pionships—all in all a glorious
past. Such successes, however,
have not been too frequent of late
but we are quickly building up
our strength after the loss of all
our best runners over the past few
years—we need you to help us do
it.
If you ran at school and don't
want to become an overweight,
inactive slob, or are a confirmed
addict to the sport come and join
us; we always vfind a race for
everyone who wants whatever
their standard. Come and sign up
at our stand on Freshers Day, or
turn up for our fresher's run (well
shuffle) on Wednesday—2.15 p.m.
in the Gym—there's tea after-
wards. For any further informa-
tion see the club notice board by
the stairs outside the bar.
