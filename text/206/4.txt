AFRICA SOCIETY
To old members it is: " Wel-
come from your holidays." To
those who are here for the first
time it is: " Welcome to the Col-
lege." I am addressing all Afri-
cans and friends of Africa who are
potential members of this Society.
The Society provides a meeting
ground for Africans and others in
the College interested in African
affairs. It is non-political and non-
racial. The only qualification for
membership is a genuine interest
in meeting people from your own
continent and from other places
socially. Come to the Africa
Society stand on Level 3 in the
Union Building on Freshers Day
and to the Freshers Reception
