three months behind schedule—
main cause for the hold up has
been late delivery of materials.

During the vacation over three
hundred girls slept in South Side

a part of a group of three thou-
sand Italian University students
staying in London during the
summer.

The noise problem in South
Side has been looked into with
the possibility of double glazing
windows being borne in mind. It
appears, however, that this is un-
likely due to the high cost. What
appears more likely is a restric-
tion on the numbers of hops, etc.,
held there, and perhaps members
of hall committees being given
some responsibility in controlling
the noise on their respective stair-
case.
Rod Jones, last years Vice-
President of Guilds, is a present
training with party, prior to go-
ing to Antarctica for two years
this autumn.
