This year l.C. Cricket Club
Tour Devon
with varied successes
On the Tuesday after the end of term, sixteen I.C. cricketers
set off for Devon in the old rattletrap Larry calls a coach, but which
should be in the Brighton run. After many Bridge hands the com-
pany arrived in Southampton and played the University despite the
only rain of the tour. I.C. declared at 139 for 5, thanks to good
batting by Eastell, Hunt, and Cleare, but the opposition scraped
home by two wickets with a six from the first ball of the last over,
Rice taking 5 for 40.
After a night in Dorchester where the " Sydney Arms " enforced
prohibition due to the alleged escapades of the previous party, we
arrived in Yelverton and tied with the Bohemians at 141 each. This
was celebrated in the Rock Hotel and the coach where three Guilds-
men and one minor were assaulted by twelve R.C.S. types. After
a stout defence and much bloodshed, order was restored and the mob
staggered into the Kynance, Plymouth, to dispute the few single beds
available. The unlucky losers had to share doubles with their
fellows.
Next day H.M.S. Drake scored 200 despite a marathon bowling
spell by Roger Marriott, who took 5 for 56 in 28 successive overs.
I.C. could not fathom the swing and cut of Devon bowler Pellew
and only managed 64. More beer was drunk and the lads then had
a free preview of the Devonport Royal Tournament Field Gun team
practising.
At Plymouth College on Friday, the staff raised 203 for 5
declared while the I.C. fielders had to contend with a shower of
javelins from youthful athletes and excellent batting by their masters.
This time the off-spin of Swinburne (Devon and Yorkshire 2nds)
was our downfall and we could only equal the previous day's tally.
Sorrows were drowned at the local with our old friend Ted Mercer.
On Saturday we braved the by 8 wickets at Ashburton, where
we
Exeter 'by-pass, reacned Exeter
and defeated Brighton Brunswick
scoring 160 for 6 in reply to their
156 for 7 declared. Clements took
6 for 48 and Eastell, Cleare and
Blythin batted well. We celebra-
ted this success in Torquay.
Sunday saw us playing out time
against the Whiteways Cider X I .
We got 105 for 9 in reply to their
160. Eastell hit their famous tree
with the first shot of another good
knock. Subsequently we changed
our brew and indulged in a rather
rowdy fielding practice.
On Monday everyone went
bathing at Torquay before an
evening game at Brixham where
we scored 166 for 3 in reply to
th locals 174 for 5 declared all in
the space of 3 hours. (Sunde 41
and 63 not out and Hunt 51).
Then followed a hectic drinking
session during which ten R.C.S.
men could not remember the
Kangela and were out shouted by
three Guildsmen led by one miner.
St. Andrews University beat us
we could only reach 104 on a
green pitch. In the subsequent
Beer Match Clements lost the ball
with a six which went through the
open roof of the coach into the
driver's pocket.
We beat the Lympstone Royal
Marines on Wednesday Scoring
141 for 7 declared and puting
them out for 63, thanks to the
batting of Eastell and Poyser and
the bowling of Marriott and Rice.
Then celebrations and ten-pin
bowling in Torquay.
The final match against
Paignton was a disaster. The
local pro', Handley, bowled us
out for 48, which they got for
three wickets. We could not do
much better in the beer game
which followed.
Our final record was: P 10,
W. 2, T 1, D 2, L 5; but a good
time and fine weather were en-
joyed By all. Lack of an accurate
and penetrative fast bowler and
inconsistent batting were our main
handicaps.
RUGGER
RUGBY FOOTBALL CLUB
The I.C.R.F.C. is probably the
biggest college rugby club in the
country. Every Saturday we turn
out 8 and sometimes 9 XV's. The
1st X V plays the second teams of
most of the big clubs such as
Wasps, Richmond, Rosslyn Park,
etc., and the standard gradually
falls to the B.V.'s who will play
anyone who has a bar.
Trials are being held at Har-
lington on Wednesday and Satur-
day next and free coaches are pro-
vided from the Union and it is
hoped to see as many Freshers
along as possible.
The club trains on Monday
evenings in the gym 5.30-7.30 and
Thursday 12.45 p.m. in the park.
There is also training on Tuesdays
for the 1st team and other keen
members of the club.
The University Knockout Cup
has been won by Imperial College
9 times in the last 13 years and it
is only in the last couple of years
that our domination of the com-
petition has ceased. However,
with the present nucleus of
players and the full support of
the freshers, I am confident that
the trophy will once again be in
I.C.'s hands next March.
Hoping for full co-operation
from every member of the club.
M. TURNER,
Captain.
I hope you find time to visit our
stall on Freshers Day. We offer
excellent facilities to accomp-
lished or novice players. If you
would like to play this iseason
come and see us now. The first
trial matches will be at Harlington
(free coaches from the Union) on
Wednesday.
On Saturdays the club runs 4
XI's against other well known
London clubs, but on Wednesday
we only run one team and each of
the constituent college runs its
own team. These four teams play
in the U.L. Cup, and on remain-
ing Wednesdays the constituent
college teams play in the Stephen-
son cup. This is competed for
on a league basis. The club enters
the U.L. challenge cup, and sends
two sides to the U.L. six a side,
being the present holders of the
latter.
There is also a mixed X I which
maintained an unbeaten record
well into the second term. No one
knows quite how this was
achievedâ€”but it was! If you
would like to join do come along
and have a chat with us, you will
be most welcome.
