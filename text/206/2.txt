RAGS-CARNIVAL-SHOWS-WINE
LC's year socially is very busy. There are Dinners, Balls,
Dances, Hops, Rag Days, Shows, and continuous parties.
DANCES
The year starts for most with the Freshers Hop on the first
Saturday of term ; this is well worth going to, it is the first chance
for people to meet people and is heavily attended by both the male
and female sex. After this, on every Saturday night during the year,
there are Hops in the Union. I.C. is renowned for these Saturday
nights and all sorts of secretaries, nurses, trainee teachers, etc., attend
regularly. Also during the year the Jazz Club hold really fabulous
Stomps in Southside.
Many formal balls and dances are held scattered throughout the
year, namely the Commem. Ball at Claridges, the Mines Ball at the
end of the Christmas term (non-Miners do occasionally attend), the
Engineer's Dinner-Dance in January, the I.C.W.A. Formal in March,
and during the Summer term the May Ball, which for me will be the
greatest night of all, and the Silwood Ball.
In a slightly lighter vein there are trie two fancy dress Carnival
Nights, one organised jointly by Guilds and Mines, the other by

CARNIVAL
In May there is the I.C. Carni-
val. This lasts a week and its
main aim is to collect money for
Charity. This can be great fun,
