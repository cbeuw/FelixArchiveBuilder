ARE YOU A FRUSTRATED
WRITER ?
If you are there are jobs wait-
ing for you on the Felix Staff.
Even if you cannot write come
and see us in the Press room
(opposite the lift on the top floor
of the Union) on Freshers Day.
If you do not see us on
Freshers Day drop a note in the
Union Rack or come along and
see me any time in Room 96 Beit.
N. J. WALKER,
Editor.
