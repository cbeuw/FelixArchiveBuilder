casionally Guildsmen) is held.
As side shows there is throwing
flour at each other, and the few
Gaps who dare to watch, forming
human chains over zebra cross-
ings etc.—in fact letting off steam
without causing " too much " in-
convenience to the general public.
Carnival 1964.. . . Drivers of the
Whitbreads Brewers Dray and
the policeman prepare to move
off at the head of the Carnival
Procession.
It is the great sport day of the
ye$r. In early December the
Swimming Gala materialises. We
all visit the West End to watch
swimmers from Guilds, R.C.S.
and mines battle it out in the
water with the occasional addi-
tional participant helping. It is
rumoured that this year, the
President of I.C.W.A. is to appear
in a Bikini (topless?).
WINE (BEER)
This is consumed regularly,
there are, however, one or two
particular occasions. Freshers
Dinners—over last year or two the
authorities have been trying to
improve the tone of these func-
tions; not, unfortunately, with
much success; after the dinner is
an ideal time to drink heavily not
during it. At each dinner there
is quite likely to be a mascot
attempt by some other I.C. college
and after each dinner a great sing-
ing session follows in the bar.
This can be good fun, everyone
drinking a fair amount of beer
and singing songs they never even
knew existed. Other good Bar
Nights: Morphy Night (after the
Boat Club Dinner), after the
Swimming Gala, and whenever a
few of you decide to have a drink.
As you can see there is a great
deal of organised social life at
I.C., not mentioned are the
numerous parties which go on
every weekend. You only need
to keep your ears open and you
are sure to heal of one.
SHOWS
There is the R.C.S. Smoking
Concert; this is a sort of theatre
revue, the Folk Song Club playing
a leading part, Gilbert and Sul-
livan put on by the Music Society
and sundry plays produced by the
Dram. Soc.
I hope you have a very good
year and pass your exams, it is
worth it just to get back for
another year of—pleasure.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy.'So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
