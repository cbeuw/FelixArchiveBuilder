FRESHERS RECREATION
] GUIDE
Roving in Yugoslavia
Eleven members of the crew
went on this year's summer camp
in the Julian Alps in northern
Yugoslavia. We broke the train
journey for 24 hours at Munich
and had a very enjoyable time in
the hands of the local scouts there
who introduced us to some excel-
lent Bavarian beer at the Opera
House.
Our first stop in Yugoslavia
was at Bled where we stayed for
3 days in order to find our way
about and get acclimatised. Hav-
ing set up our base camp at Vrsic
(4500 ft.) we split into three
groups and set off to conquer
some peaks. We spent several
nights in mountain huts and cot-
tages belonging to the Yugoslav
Alpine Club and were made very
welcome everywhere once it was
made known that we were English
and not German.
In between three or four day
trips into the mountains we col-
lected mouse-eared chickweed for
the Botany dept. to be sorted by
our expert, Vic Moss. A fortnight
in the hills went all too quickly,
everyone had a good time and
most of us got up Yugoslavia's
highest peak, Triglav, (9500 ft.)
The final port ot call was Krk
(pronounced as Scottish Kirk)
which we reached by a combina-
tion of bus, rail and sea travel,
spending a night at a students'
centre in Rigeka. We spent a
pleasant few days on this island
off the Adriatic coast lazing on
the shore and playing tourists,
not to mention collecting sea-
urchin spines (unintentionally).
The return journey to London
took 40 hours and apart from a
short while in a four wheeled
wooden-seated Yugocarriage, was
quite comfortable. Highlights of
the trip were the Vesta curry
cooked in the bog between Venice
and Milan by Nigel Knowles and
Chris Waterman, and the soup
and swe:t brewed on the platform
at Dover while waiting for the
train to Victoria.
Main topic of conversation on
this last lap? Where shall it be
next year. Austria or Scandina-
via?
Also during the year we hold
regular weekend trips to open
parts of the country. Why not
join us? Come along and see us
at our stall on Freshers Day.
R.C.S. Motor Club
Jez in Piccadilly
This year one of the star attrac-
tions of Freshers Day will un-
fortunately not be on display.
That is the R.C.S. Mascot Jeze-
bel, a 1916 Dennis Fire Engine.
She suffered severe engine trouble
whilst taking part in the Historic
Commercial Vehicle Club's
Brighton run.
Dennis's have kindly allowed
us to reassemble the fire engine in
their works on Saturdays. We
need people prepared to travel to
Guildford (transport provided) on
Saturdays throughout the Autumn
Term to help with the work.
There remains plenty of work
to be done on the chassis and
bodywork, at present in the Motor
Club Garage (behind the Chem-
istry Building). This work will be
done on Wednesday afternoons.
Anyone who is free at that time
will be particularly welcome.
If anyone thinks they can help
the club in any way they are wel-
come to coffee in Room 487 Sel-
kirk Hall.
I.C. FOLK & SQUARE
DANCING CLUB
The Imperial College Folk and
Square Dancing Club meets
weekly on Friday evenings, part-
ners coming from all over Lon-
don and always outnumbering the
male members of the Club
throughout the year. Our pro-
gramme includes American
Square dances and Scandinavian
dances as well as the more usual
English and Scottish folk dances.
A new venture has been the
regular performances of dances
to music provided by our own
band. In the Spring term we shall
again be attending the annual
Inter-Varsity Folk Dance Rally to
be held at Newcastle.
Anyone wishing for pleasant
evenings of a different type, un-
available elsewhere in I.C., and
who dares to come along can be
assured of . . . . . ! ! well com«
and see !! All budding musicians
just as welcome.
Hoofs
& Folks
Last June a new standard was
set in I.C. for the quality of re-
corded material wtih the appear-
ance of the 12-inch LP Kensing-
ton Folk Festival 1964. Within
a fortnight of release 70 copies
were sold at 25/- each; only a
few remain.
Not only do the performers
sound truly professional, but the
recording engineer is to be con-
gratulated for the clean and pre-
cise result. With a pictorial and
fully annotated cover, even the
minutest detail was not ignored.
In all the record represented a
fine reflection of the spirit of the
I.C. Folk Song Club, at that time
barely six months old ! Now ten
months old and with Union back-
ing to boot, the club has an am-
bitious programme for 1964/5.
The first of the fortnightly
hootenannies will be an open
night on Thursday, 15th October
—so bring along your instru-
ments and song-sheets. And if
you don't know what a hooten-
anny is, be curious and come
along anyway—'you'll soon find
out and you're sure to enjoy it!
On 29th October, Bill Clifton, the
top American bluegrass singer,
will make a return visit with the
Echo Mountain Boys.
But there's more to the club
than just hoots, though as a mem-
ber (fee 5/-) you are entitled to
entry for a shilling under the ad-
vertised price (and there will be
at least ten hoots this year).
Every Tuesday lunchtime there
will be record sessions. But
come to our stand at the Freshers'
exhibition or contact the club's
president or secretary via the
Union letter rack for full details
of the club—and watch out for
our notices (they're the eye-catch-
ing ones, we hope).
EXPLORATION
Since 1956, 39 expeditions have
been supported by the College to
places as remote as East Green-
land and Ethiopia and as far apart
as the Bolivian Andes and the
Karakoram. Planning and run-
ning such an expedition provides
excellent training for organisation,
together with the experience
gained from living and working
with other people in an isolated
environment—;ind, of course, it
provides a medium for adventure.
Would-he explorers at I.C. are
well catered for both financially
and in other ways. Every year
both the College and the Union
make available a considerable
sum of money to assist with the
cost of College Explorations.
These funds are administered by
the Exploration Board. Having
money so close at hand is a great
boost, particularly now that com-
petition for support outside the
College has become very keen.
Proposals for expeditions are
considered by the Board in the
Autumn Term. Some scientific
research is essential nowadays if
the expedition is to be justified
and the Board will need to be
convinced that the party is able to
carry out its proposed aims. Ap-
proval of a particular venture is
generally coupled' with some
financial support. Insurance of
personnel and equipment is auto-
matically undertaken by the
Board and a certain amount of
equipment is held for loan to ex-
peditions.
Help and advice on all aspects
of mounting expeditions can be
sought through the Union's Ex-
ploration Society
