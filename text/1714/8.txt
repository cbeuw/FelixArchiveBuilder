Kendrick vs Kendrick: To Pimp A Butterfly or good
kid m.A.A.d city?
As the end of a decade in which Kendrick Lamar has dominated approaches, which of his records is truly the best?

T
en years ago
today, the name
Kendrick Lamar
meant no more
than anyone else’s. The
now 31-year-old rapper
was still going by K-Dot
and would shortly receive
a career-changing cosign
from Lil Wayne. Today
he is one of the best
known and certainly most
respected artists in music.
With twelve Grammys
and four platinum records
under his belt – not to men-
tion the first Pulitzer prize
awarded to a non-classical
or jazz musician – few
can claim to have been so
successful in both critical
and commercial fields.
But as the 2010’s – or
teens, as this decade may
be (hopefully not) known
– draw to an end, music
fans everywhere must ask
themselves, “what was the
best album the decade?”
For many the answer will
be a project by Kendrick
Lamar – but which? The
decision may at least
be narrowed; only two
of Duckworth’s records
pack the lyrical, musical
and conceptual punch to
be up for consideration.
While both Section.80
and DAMN., have many
a good quality between
them, neither match the
precision and cohesion
of our two contenders: To
Pimp A Butterfly and good
kid, m.A.A.d city.
Critical heavyweight To
Pimp A Butterfly (TPAB)
clocks in with eleven
Grammy nominations,
five wins, and platinum
status. ‘How Much A
Dollar Cost’ even earned
the top spot on Obama’s
song of the year list. With
brazen influences from
jazz, funk, and soul, the
record is an ear opening
experience; every track
boasts instruments and
textures a hip-hop histori-
an would be hard pressed
to find on any other
record in the genre. From
Thundercat’s bubbly licks
slinking all over opener
‘Wesley’s Theory’ to the
skipping beat, warped, and
increasingly trippy vocals
(courtesy of a Sufjan
Stevens sample) of ‘Hood
Politics’, Lamar’s bold ex-
perimentalism serves the
record well. ‘For Free?’
brings a wailing big band
to Lamar’s caricaturish
demands for wealth from
an exploitative record
industry (“I need forty
acres and a mule / not a
40 ounce and a pit bull”)
blending together to
create a surreal swagger.
Another standout moment
from ‘u’ sees a distant
sample hopping seeming-
ly at random from ear to
ear in your headphones,
while K-Dot murmurs to
himself, suicidal and de-
pressed in his hotel room,
creating a supremely
palpable moment.
between scenes from the
lyricist’s adolescence with
less regard for chronology
than Quentin Tarantino,
its tales stitched together
by a collection of voice-
mails and conversation
recordings that are surely
now quintessential to the
hip-hop art form. The
moralofouryoungprotag-
onists’ story is also played
out through these scenes,
first on ‘Sing About Me,
I’m Dying of Thirst’,
where Lamar encounters
an elderly neighbour
(Maya Angelou), who
offers him baptism as the
beginning of a new life.
The wordsmith’s mother
also makes an appearance
on the album’s penulti-
mate track, advising him
to follow music and “tell
his story”.
TPAB on the other hand,
takes a more refreshing
approach with tracks con-
cluded by a spoken word
poem – one which grows
as Kendrick’s journey
through fame and racial
politics goes on. Only on
the final track is it read
in its completed form,
alongside an “interview”
between Lamar and
Tupac, sculpted from old
interview clips and finally
a second poem, this time
fleshing out the metaphor
of the inner butterfly –
“talent…thoughtfulness”
within a “prisoner of the
streets”, who exploits
his artistic streak to his
advantage, with turmoil
ensuing. While both in-
terlude styles hem songs
together effortlessly and
deliver a message similar
beyond coincidence,
TPAB brings a more
unique frame for its 16
tracks to the table, as well
as allowing it to deliver its
message more powerfully.
GKMC has an appeal
that lies not so much
in pushing hip-hop’s
borders, but creating
something original,
intelligent, and catchy
from its building blocks.
Lamar’s first major label
release cruises over lush,
dark samples, with addic-
tively catchy rhythms and
hooks that make it both
an engrossing experience
and a fitting backdrop
for any party. With more
typical, though nonethe-
less gorgeous, production
than TPAB, the record is a
fun and fascinating listen
for hip-hop fans, instru-
mentals laced with detail
(and a healthy helping of
Outkast influence) that
suit attentive listening
as well as relaxation.
Lyrically Kendrick had
found the formula: flip a
hip-hop trope on its head
with a hook that sounds
as if the trope were being
followed. The results?
Hits like ‘Swimming
Pools (Drank)’, ‘Backseat
Freestyle’, and ‘Bitch
Don’t Kill My Vibe’,
earning the record triple
platinum status.
GKMC’s setting in
Lamar’s youth provides
the perfect backdrop for
him to critique everything
from drinking culture to
rap’s habit of impossibly
hyperbolic braggadocio:
“pray my dick get big
as the Eiffel tower / so I
can fuck the world for 72
hours”. While this leaves
Kendrick open to criticism
of having his message too
easily missed, lines like
“all I see is strobe lights
blinding me in my hind-
sight” and “this is cul-de
sac and plenty cognac and
major pain” prove he has
more than enough skill to
eloquently balance catchi-
ness with harsh reality.
TPAB is not without its
shortcomings; critiqued
for its self-indulgence, it’s
often dense. Abuzz with
intense lyrics, complex
harmonies, and rhythms
with song structures that
veer off into new territory
without warning, this
record can be challenging,
even on repeated listens.
Dense harmonies on
tracks like ‘Alright’ and
‘Complexion (A Zulu
Love)’ might centre their
lyrics’ reflection on black
culture, but at the price of
encumbering the grooves
of the tracks. Contrasting-
ly simple, raw tracks like
‘The Blacker the Berry’
and ‘i’ are more than
welcome by the end of the
record.
In many ways it is good
that Lamar has delivered
his powerful message in
two distinct and thorough-
ly cinematic masterpieces;
fans of the catchy hooks
of GKMC might not hear
out TPAB’s seven-minute
spoken word conclusion,
while those enjoying
the complexity of TPAB
might not tolerate the
simple riffs of bangers
like ‘m.A.A.d City’. The
constant between the two
records is the man behind
the mic – Kendrick Lamar
whose myriad voices,
dense rhymes, and ingen-
ious wordplay never cease
to amaze.
In my opinion however,
To Pimp A Butterfly is
simply a more compelling
and original piece of art,
achieving something com-
pletely unique on tracks
like ‘u’, ‘For Sale?’, and
a significant remainder of
its track listing – as well
as delivering its message
more precisely. Earning
it, in my eyes, a place at
the top of Lamar’s discog-
raphy.
