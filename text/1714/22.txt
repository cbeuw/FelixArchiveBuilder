I
ndeed, with him you
will be able to play
Squirtle, Ivysaur
and Charizard, and
switch between them at
will during the match.
These beloved characters
are from the Pokémon
franchise, appearing in the
original games Red and
Blue in 1996. They are
all a different evolution
of the first three starting
Pokémons of the game:
Squirtle is the first evo-
lution of his line, Ivysaur
is the second evolution of
Bulbasaur and Charizard
is the third and final
evolution of Charmander.
And this is masterfully
represented in their game-
play in Ultimate, with
each of them having a dif-
ferent fighting style. This
makes Pokémon Trainer a
very flexible and powerful
character as a whole, by
adapting to the opponent
or situation in order to
take the victory.
To kick it off we have
Squirtle, a light and
very small fighter with
extremely fast movement
and close-range attacks.
Each of his hits however
doesn’t do a lot of damage
so he relies on a series
of fast chained attacks.
So as Squirtle, you need
to continuously dance
around your opponent and
avoid their hits thanks to
your small hitbox, and
punish them with all your
attacks, especially your
particularly fast aerials.
To complete his kit, he
has a few more tools he
can use with his specials.
Squirtle’s neutral is his
Water Gun, a charged
attack to push opponents
away without damaging
them, useful to counter
certain recoveries. His
side-special is Withdraw,
where he will hide in his
shell, protecting him from
any damage, and dash to
the left or right, great for
some safe damage. And
finally, his up-special is his
Waterfall, where he will
rise diagonally, potential-
ly taking enemies in the
flow. This is a mediocre
recovering tool but can
be used at the end of an
aerial combo as a finisher.
Apart from that move,
Squirtle has very few kill
moves due to his weak
smash attacks, making it
hard for him to actually
take the stock. So when
the opponent’s percentage
is high enough, it’s time
to switch Pokémon with
down-special, an ability
all three of them share.
Then comes Ivysaur,
an overall medium char-
acter in weight, speed and
power, with a great mid-
range combat. He relies
on his vines to hit his
opponent while staying at
a reasonably safe distance.
Ivysaur can harass easily
with his forward- and
back-air, which have a in-
credible range. His smash
attacks and grabs also
have an incredible reach,
with some sweet power
to go with it. Ivysaur’s
specials grants him even
more ranged potential,
even allowing some
long-ranged pressure.
His neutral is his Bullet
Seed, where he rapidly
fires seeds directly above
him, to seriously damage
any enemy coming from
the air. His side-special
is his Razor Leaf, a long
range projectile which
will damage and impair
the opponent enabling a
potential follow-up attack.
And last but not least is
his up-special Vine Whip,
both a great finisher and
recovery. Indeed Ivysaur
can use these vines
to whip an opponent
overhead out of the screen
or can use it to recover
at a ridiculous distance
only if there is a ledge
to grab on. But if you’re
having some trouble to
secure the kill or want an
even better recovery, it’s
time to switch to the final
Pokémon.
To finish the trio, we
have Charizard, a very
powerful heavy weight
fighter but with slow
attacks. He does however
have good mobility
options with a decent
move speed and a third
available jump. You will
need to take Charizard
to end the battle with
his attacks and abilities
with ridiculous damage
and knockback. Your
best tools are your fast
back-air and side-tilt
or slow but extremely
powerful side-smash
and up-smash to knock
them out of the park. But
Charizard has even more
dangerous weapons in his
arsenal with his specials.
Firstly his neutral is his
Flamethrower, where he
will breathe fire onto his
opponent, damaging and
impairing them from a
safe distance. Then comes
the big guns, his side-spe-
cial Flare Blitz, where
Charizard winds-up a
forward charge engulfed
in flames, and explodes at
the contact of an enemy. A
great horizontal recovery
that can kill at merely 60%
but will damage Chariz-
ard by 6% at every use.
To finish off, his up-spe-
cial Fly is again a great
finisher and recovery tool.
Charizard will spiral into
the sky covering decent
vertical distances and will
also hit any enemy above
potentially killing them
at 100%. This tool is of
course less powerful than
his side-special but much
safer as opponents have
less time to react to it.
As you can see,
Pokémon Trainer covers
a variety of fighting styles
that can theoretically be
played separately, but it
is by combining them
that you bring out his
true potential. With three
times the amount of tools
and abilities in his kit,
Pokémon Trainer has
many creative combi-
nations to discover. But
the general tactic is to
start off with Squirtle to
get some quick damage,
then to switch to Ivysaur
to zone them in the mid-
game, and finally to take
Charizard to finish the
job. Nonetheless, you can
play only one Pokémon
to try to counter your
opponent’s fighting style.
Finally, a crucial trick to
know as Pokémon Trainer
is his switch dodge, which
takes advantage of the in-
vincibility frames of your
down-special instead of a
shield or roll to avoid your
opponent.
In conclusion, if you
manage to combine mas-
terfully only the strengths
of Squirtle, Ivysaur and
Charizard, you get a very
powerful overall char-
acter. Furthermore, with
three different fighting
styles, Pokémon Trainer
can be particularly hard
to master but allows him
to have no real counter
pick, bringing him up to a
higher tier. So even if you
are not particularly inde-
cisive, I highly suggest
you pick up Smash’s
3-for-1 special as he is not
only strong but also loads
of fun.
