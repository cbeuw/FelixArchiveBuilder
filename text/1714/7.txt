London is at knife’s edge: fatal stabbings at
record high
How can we handle the situation?

L
ondon has a knife
problem. By the
time of writing,
ten people have
died in 2019 from stab
wounds. By the time
you are reading this, that
number will likely have
increased by two or three.
But people are not just
numbers on a spreadsheet.
Lives are being lost, and
a blanket of fear is de-
scending upon the youth
of London. Knife crime
has increased year on
year since 2014, with the
greatest increase among
young people, namely
those between 13 -17. In
fact, there are over 1,000
recorded admissions to
hospital for young people
a year just from stabbings,
and this has risen by 60%
since 2013. Why is this
happening, and how can
we address it?
Experts refer to
knife crime as a ‘health
problem’. They do this
because knife crime
spreads like a disease. If
knife crime were a disease,
then we are very close to a
pandemic scenario. More
and more teenagers are
carrying knives because
they are afraid. There is
this illusion that carrying
a knife will make you
safer, that you are less
likely to be stabbed if you
carry a knife. However,
the opposite is true. The
escalation of a situation to
violence is far more likely
given the false sense of
security and confidence
people experience when
carrying a knife. To give
an interesting analogy,
drivers who have taken
lessons to learn how to
drive safely on ice are
more likely to have an
accident on ice, as they
overestimate their own
ability and become confi-
dent. The combination of
fear and false confidence
results in more and more
violent crimes, which
has reached the highest
on record, over 250,000
offenses in London alone
for 2017.
The young are more
vulnerable to this kind of
crimes, in both carrying
knives and being wounded
from them. Students who
are expelled from state
schools are most likely
within their age group to
commit offenses. They
are also perfect targets for
recruitment from gangs in
London.
What has been
done so far?
In response to the
problem, Sadiq Khan the
London mayor launched
a task force of 272 in
February 2018, whom in
the first six months made
1,361 arrests, and seized
340 knives and 40 fire
arms. Inching closer to
the source of the problem,
every London school has
been offered access to
knife wands, to detect
students carrying knives.
200 schools have taken
up the offer thus far.
Glasgow once held one of
the highest murder rates in
western Europe. But since
treating knife crime as a
health issue, the number
of offensive weapons has
dropped by 69% over a
decade. The number of
children and teenagers
murdered has dropped
to zero for five straight
years (2011 – 2016).
Experts who worked with
Glasgow police to tackle
violent crime there have
since come to London,
working with the Mayors
office to help to solve
London’s problem.
What else can be
done?
This is a good start,
but it does not tackle
the heart of the matter.
Young people, especially
those from disadvan-
taged backgrounds, or
have mental health or
behavioral issues, are
turning to crime. They do
and social opportunities
to young people in a safe
environment.
They are often touted
as great institutions for
preventing youth crime
and for collaborating with
police.Butinthepastthree
years, funding has been
cut down by a third. In my
hometown, the youth club
was forced to close. Some
research suggests that
well-run youth clubs help
reduce crime, but poorly
funded and badly super-
vised clubs can encourage
crime alongside other
social problems such
as underage drinking.
The number of students
expelled from school has
increased year on year
since 2013, hitting 35
a day in 2015. School
spending on students was
cut by 8% since 2010,
with the greatest cuts
being sixth form funding
at 25%. Often, schools and
sixth forms do not have
the resources to address
the situation of problem-
atic students or to offer
them additional support. It
is now easier for schools
to expel students than to
allocate enough resources
for them to continue. As
well as tackling knives on
the street and the sale of
knives to young people,
the government needs to
stop the source of these
crimes, in a compassion-
ate way. Our youth are
not criminals: they are
vulnerable people who
have become victims of
fear and circumstances.
The government must
bring back funding for the
institutions that can help
them.
Some of the victims killed by knife related crimes in 2018// The Guardian
“The young
are more
vulnerable
to this kind
of crimes
crime, in both
carr knives
and being
wounded from
them”
this for several reasons.
Firstly, teenagers are less
well-off, and have less
resources and opportu-
nities available to them
than in previous years.
Turning to crime can be
very lucrative. It also
offers something to do
and provides social op-
portunities. Students who
have fallen out of the state
school system, through
suspension or expulsion,
are particularly vulnera-
ble to these motivations.
Youth services are a great
way to provide support
