T
is the season
of romance!
Whether you’re
looking for a film
for your next night in with
your significant other, or
to drown the bitter feel-
ing of rejection, Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind is surely the answer.
It’s a film that’s suitable
for all couples, whether
you’re on the first chapter
of your life as a pair or
just staying together for
the kids.
Pushing the boundaries
of conventional rom-
coms, Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind
juggles romance, comedy
and science fiction. We
meet Joel and Clementine
through an awkward but
sweet meet-cute on a
train. The pair immediate-
ly gets on, and romance
surely ensues. But there’s
a snag. Although we’ve
been introduced to all the
necessary ingredients for
a blossoming romance,
there is more to this recipe
under the surface.
This is not your com-
mon-or-garden rom-com.
What follows is a twisty
drama framed like a
psychological thriller,
dealing with themes of
memory and identity. The
two leads, Jim Carey and
Kate Winslet, are excel-
lent and breathe life into
the wonderfully written
characters. Charlie Kauf-
man’s imaginative script
embodies the energy of
a five-year old, and is
complemented by Michel
Gondry’s surrealist direc-
tion. All these elements
come together to produce
a perfectly balanced
wholesome and insightful
take on relationships.
Valentine’s Day may be
over, but be sure to check
out Eternal Sunshine of
the Spotless Mind. It’ll
make your latest date
seem like your very first.

The Handmaiden
L
ong time fans
of Felix Film
will no doubt
have seen The
Handmaiden crop up
multiple times before,
and for very good reason.
It is hard not to find an
excuse to recommend this
movie. Especially at this
lovey dovey time, singles,
couples and more alike
should look no further
then settling into your
comfy spots and diving in.
This movie is a myriad
of achievements, one of
Park Chan Wook’s finest
accomplishments: the
stunning beauty portrayed
by the camera work and
editing, accompanied by
a score which perfectly
complements and accents
every single meticulous-
ly-taken shot.
The four lead char-
acters feel like the only
four characters in the
movie due to their on-
screen presence and
scene-stealing emotion at
every step, which works
greatly to its favour. The
power dynamics, the
intricate relationships,
the secrets, the deception,
the love, the loathing
are all so well presented
throughout, with the body
language really shining
through. The romance in
the movie is spectacular,
with characters fleshed
out into genuine human
beings with real emotions
for each other, which
has recently been getting
harder to come by with
romance.
This is wrapped up with
a very tight plot, which
never stops twisting,
turning, and drawing you
in, split into three acts.
These make extremely
good breathers, making
the very intense plot and
the longer runtime, less
intimidating.
Seriously, this movie
brings romance, thrills,
dark humour, eroticism,
twists, beauty and more, it
is not to be missed. -MD

A
m b i t i o u s l y
directed by
Baz Luhrmann,
Moulin Rouge!
is one of the most extrav-
agant musicals ever put
on screen. Admittedly,
the frequent explosions of
music and colour might
be too overwhelming for
some. Especially, the first
30 minutes of the film,
which is an assault on
all senses, and does need
some time getting used to.
However, afterwards, the
film becomes a poignant,
epic, and totally unforget-
table love story between
Satine and Christian,
brilliantly brought to life
by Nicole Kidman and
Ewan McGregor respec-
tively. Moulin Rouge! is
a compilation of classic
love story tropes: The
beautiful girl, the poor
boy, and the rich villain.
However, the presentation
of these elements is utter-
ly original. This is shown
in its music as well. The
Elephant Love Medley
is a novel and romantic
repackaging of the most
cliché love songs, and El
Tango de Roxanne, in my
opinion, formulates one
of the most captivating,
striking and heart-stop-
ping musical sequences
ever made.
So, this weekend,
sit back and relax, and
witness the magnificence,
Moulin Rouge! the romance, and the
utter chaos that is Moulin
Rouge! -AC
