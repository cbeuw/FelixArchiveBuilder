Felix Editor left in coma-esque state after being
informed of re-appointment
HANGMAN
Disgruntled Felix
Editor Bambi Djibouti
was reported to have
succumbed into a
coma-like state late
last night, NegaFelix
has learnt.

T
his comes after
an apparent
decision by the
College Over-
lord to keep him in his
role for another year.
Mr Djibouti was seen
wandering blank-eyed
around Queen’s Gate
Wednesday afternoon, de-
lirious and unresponsive
to his own name.
He was consequently
admitted to the nearest
hospital, where doctors
were confounded by his
apparent state, given his
otherwise good physical
condition.
It was discovered that
Mr Djibouti had met with
College Overlord Yannis
Bast earlier in the day.
Further confusion
abounded when he was
found sprawled in the
middle of the room with
various undecipherable
words along the walls of
the ward.
Sources from within
the hospital remained
silent on the matter,
however NegaFelix has
been sent an anonymous
letter containing pictures
seeming taken on a shaky
phone camera from within
the ward.
Regrettably, the
Geophysics intern who
handled the mail (and as a
result viewed the images)
was found in a similar
state to Mr Djibouti.
Careful analysis of the
images and deciphering
the moans of the intern,
is one more page in the
ongoing saga of Sandy
and Yannis Bast.
Regarding the future
of NegaFelix, Bambi
has been re-installed at
his desk by the team. It
has been reported that
he carries on much as he
If I was told I’d be here one more year, I’d be riding in one of these too... // Imperial College
did before the incident.
Experts have warned to
take close examination
to notice any difference
between his before and
after behaviour.
“Phrases
deciphered so
far include...
‘you are
reinstated as
Felix Editor’”
NegaFelix has determined
part of the writing on the
wall.
Ed. note: We take this
moment to inform our
readership that we are

reader and would advise
you to carry on reading
only if you are of a strong
constitution.
Phrases deciphered so
far include “She is risen”,
“the horror” and “you
are reinstated as Felix
Editor”.
NegaFelix is as yet
unsure as to the meaning
and are in conversation
with experts. All that can
be assumed is that this
“Bambi has
been re-
installed...
he carries on
much as he
did before the
incident..”

The College reported

he fund, which
allows under-
graduates to
apply for a
short term loan of up to
£300 from the College,
for the small price of
one’s soul, noted over
30 applications submit-
ted in the week before
Val-entine’s Day, Neg-
aFelix has learnt.
“We generally only
get like 10 applications
a year because no one
knows we exist,” said
Sherry Walkman, Head
of Student Support, “most
years we just get to blow
the rest of the money on a
staff BBQ. How were we
supposed to guess that any
Imperial students would
have relationships this
year?”
Sonia Rockafellow,
Deputy President (Free-
lance & Sermoning) ex-
pressed distinct surprise at
the news. “Wait, not all the
students are virgins?,” she
exclaimed. “No one ever
uses the free condoms in
the office - we thought
we’d have to use them as
balloons for the Elections
Results afterparty!”
Meow Thatherson,
Central Frisky Organiser
(CFO) for the College,
was notedly irked at
the revelation. “All that
money I saved with
Meat-Free Mondays,”
he was heard grumbling,
“and now these kids just
want to get some? Not
on my watch - we need a
new pool in the Faculty
Building!”
In separate but related
news, the Health Centre
has reported a spike in
incidents of carpal tunnel
amongst students in this
week.
