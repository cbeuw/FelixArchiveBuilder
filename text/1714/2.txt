Happy Valentine's Day
T
his week, I've
not done it well
at all. Much like
Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer's Manchester
United, I've been lulled
into a false sense of se-
curity by the relatively
smooth running of the
last few issues. How-
ever, the honeymoon
period is over and, with
this issue, I've come
crashing back down to
Earth. Maybe not in as
embarrassing fashion
as only mustering one
shot on target at home in
the Champions League,
but it is 8pm and I still
have a page and a half of
News and a double page
Music spread to finish...
This time last year,
I was at a Jorja Smith
concert watching my
babes perform. Who'd
have thought just one
year later, I'd be spending
my Valentine's Day in a
basement with a bunch
of dudes. In the immortal
words of Clean Bandit,
"there's no place I'd rather
be". Anyway, perhaps it's
the romance in the year
because I'm in a very
poetic mood. I've taken
the liberty of writing a
few short Valentine's
poems (this has nothing
to do with me trying to fill
up space right now):
S
hall I compare
thee to a Sum-
mer's Day, hot
and sweaty in the
West Basement.
R
oses are red,
violets are
blue, I'm stuck
in this base-
ment from 9 'til 2 (am).
T
he breeze blows
softly through
my fingers as I
type this edito-
rial, thinkin 'bout you.
2
K
iki, do you
love me? Are
you riding?
Say you'll
never ever leave from
beside me.
I can't think of anymore
sadly. Anyway, on reflec-
tion this has been an inter-
esting week. There have
been a number of devel-
opments in the News and
this also marks the week
that I finally met our Pres-
ident, Alice Gast (if you
don't count me shaking
her hand at Graduation). I
must admit, I was slightly
nervous ahead of meeting
her, wondering if she
reads the paper and has
any opinions of the less
than glowing content we
often include about the
university. Would she
quiz me on the origins
and cultural significance
of the Felix centrefold,
like the Provost did last
term? Alas, she kind of
ran off before we had the
chance to have a proper
conversation. I had been
hoping to grab her for a
quick interview but sadly
it was not to be. I'm sure
our paths will cross again.
This week, the paper
includes a rundown of
the most hotly anticipated
awards show of the year,
the 4th
Annual Neighbour-
HOOD Grammys. For
that reason, the Music
section easily snatches
the Section of the Week
prize this week (a subtle
reminder to the Arts
Section that, in the words
of J Hus, this competition
is "all about quality not
quantity"). Special shout-
out to the Books Section-
for once again providing
an extremely compelling
read - definitely skip to
that section if you have
a chance (after you've
finished taking in the
#HOODGrammys2019 of
course). Anyway, I'm out.
Happy Valentine's Day!
