V
oluntourism,
short for volun-
teer tourism, is
when someone
travels abroad and volun-
teers while on vacation,
usually lasting a week or
two. The glory days of
voluntourism are slowly
coming to an end. The
reality that it does more
harm than good in the long
term is slowly dawning on
people. Before we contin-
ue, let me make it clear
that voluntourism is not
the same as volunteering.
Voluntourism is the vol-
unteering done while on
vacation and it is usually
a non-recurring event in
someone’s life. It is usu-
ally a one-time experience
that you can use to beef
up your resume or to feel
better about yourself.
If you are planning to
spend a week in Africa
to aid poverty-stricken
orphans, you should
probably reevaluate what
you are doing to help. In
theory, giving children
moral support, passing out
food and teaching English
sounds like the perfect
way to help. However,
this couldn’t be further
from the truth. The people
whose volunteer work
can be classified into
voluntourism are usually
people lacking expertise
in the skills required.
They therefore spend a
week learning a new skill
instead of being produc-
tive. This vicious cycle
keeps repeating as, by
the time people pick up a
skill that might be useful,
they return home. Despite
this fact, most volunteers
leave with a completely
new mindset – that they
must rescue people from
the suffering they have
witnessed. It’s a noble
thought, but this trend of
voluntourism shows that
people don’t really learn
about the country they
went to, or what causes
the suffering they saw.
This leads to two major
issues, with one feeding
into the other.
Firstly, we must tackle
the mindset of the ‘be-
nevolent West’ having to
‘rescue the poor’. This
thought process leads
to Western intervention
in countries where vol-
unteers may be needed.
For example, pictures
of starving African
children are being used
in campaigns to draw
people in, but this only
convinces people that the
poverty there can’t be
solved without Western
intervention. The situation
isn’t helped by the general
lack of knowledge about
these countries. This feeds
the second major issue:
that the root problems of
suffering countries are not
addressed, as most people
are not even aware of what
they are. Volunteers are so
caught up in what they
see that they don’t stop to
think about what the un-
derlying issues could be.
As these volunteers only
see the suffering, their
misconceptions remain
and nothing is done to
address the fundamental
issues.
This raises the question:
is voluntourism doomed?
No, it isn’t. I do not raise
the issue of voluntourism
so that people shy away
from short volunteering
trips, but instead to inform
them on how to make their
time worthwhile. This can
be done by understanding
that volunteering trips
aren’t about helping the
poor, but rather learning
more about the crisis the
country is in, understand-
ing what its people are
going through, building
relations, and finding out
more about the country’s
culture. Having a better
understanding between
different cultures can
help bridge the gaps we
are faced with, as once
we stop looking at these
countries as charity cases
we can begin to find a way
to help build them up.
