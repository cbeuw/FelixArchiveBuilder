Cougar at the Orange Tree Theatre
T
he title of Rose
L e w e n s t e i n ’s
play is not vague
in any way – it
triggers a very obvious
association with the
image of an older woman,
presumably in her forties,
seducing a younger man
into an illicit sexual rela-
tionship. Leila, (Charlotte
Randle), is a superficially
powerful woman leading
the way for corporate
sustainability in the wake
of climate change. She
becomes lovers with a
young bartender in his
twenties, John (Mike
Noble), and pays to bring
him along on her travels
across the globe as she
lectures corporate giants
on the profitability of the
“Green Agenda”. Their
time is limited to hotel
rooms that blur together
as the play progresses,
becoming indistinguish-
able from one another,
as do the cities they hop
between.
It becomes clear that
John is essentially a
very expensive piece
of luggage that Leila is
lugging from country to
country, and, though he
begins to fall for her, she
seems emotionally impen-
etrable. He is just a sexual
object to her, refusing the
intimacy he desires. The
chaos within their rela-
tionship is mirrored both
in the chaos of the outside
world and the physical
chaos of the set, which
is slowly demolished
throughout the play.
frenzied non-linear snap-
shots of John and Leila’s
affair, and how it comes
to fall apart. The dialogue
flicks back and forth in
time to repeat previous
sentiments and lines, and
the effect is enhanced by
the use of lighting and
movement. My closing
piece of advice would
be not to be put off by
the mediocre reviews
this play is receiving (a
surprise to me personally).
It’s a visually stimulating
watch, with interesting
power play between the
two characters. At its
heart, this is a play about
consumption, in all the
different senses of the
word. As writer Rose
Lewenstein powerfully
puts it in a podcast with
Orange Tree Theatre:
“They are consuming the
world, we are consuming
the world, they are con-
suming each other, and
the play is consuming
them”.
The Great Gatsby: An Immersive Experience
N
ot to brag, but
I was seated
personally by
Jay Gatsby
himself.
The Great Gatsby is a
tragedy written by F. Scott
Fitzgerald set in 1920s
America where the wealthy
squander their money,
behaving recklessly, loving
foolishly. The story centres
around love triangles
between a mysterious Jay
Gatsby and a married (to a
cheating Tom Buchanan)
Daisy Buchanan. They throw
grand parties as facades to
their unhappy lives, only to
end in murder and suicide.
Though immersive theatre
is always very interactive,
the success of this show
exceeded my expectations.
I spent the entirety of the
show skirting actors, hoping
to not get called, but also
curious enough to tail them
from a safe distance and not
miss out on the juicy drama.
Roaring twenties fashion
doesn’t exist in London now,
for good reason. It’s simply
too cold, as was Gatsby’s
Drugstore. But amidst
masking the shivering for
jazz hands, the open bar
throughout the show made
the chills less uncomforta-
ble. Gatsby’s Drugstore is a
shady derelict building, but
with a charm capturing the
hedonistic pleasures of the
1920s. Large dance floors,
two bars, balcony, and other
hidden rooms are left for the
audience to roam through
and explore, just like in a
house party.
The chandeliers, sofas,
and pianos scream osten-
dance with Miss Baker, and
an audience member ranked
the best dancers. Everyone
was in character (but my
hurt for not being chosen
was real). Throughout the
show, the arguing characters
would storm off taking some
of the audience with them,
forming allies. Ms Baker
dragged me and some other
ladies to Daisy’s room and
we decided what she should
wear to her tea with Gatsby
(we had to settle for a white
dress because Daisy’s maid
has no sense of style and
didn’t pack anything good
enough).
The premise of the show
is to transform and take the
audience to the times of
1920s America for about 85
minutes. They did this very
well, judging by some teary
faces at Myrtle’s funeral.
What’s even more special
is that all your reactions
and contributions matter
and make a difference to the
specifications of the story.
The active improvisations
were a testament to the skills
of the actors, with special
mention to Ivy Corbin
(playing Jordan Baker) who
clearly stole every scene
with her glamorous persona.
For those Fitzgerald fans
who are looking to appreci-
ate the literature and the Dai-
sy-Gatsby dream team, sadly
this isn’t a show for you. But
for the Gatsby fandom who
end (“phones in the 1920s
would shock the people
out of their minds”), the
Charleston dance moves
you learn will make you the
suavest person during your
next night out.

Mike Noble and Charlotte Randle as John and Leila // Orange Tree Theatre
“brilliantly
acted and
directed”
The actors have an ef-
fortless dynamic, and their
wide emotional range
is clear from Randle’s
depiction of a hypocritical
Leila, jet-setting around
the world as some sort of
climate change warrior
whilst trebling her salary
and living a wasteful life
of luxury, and Noble’s
transition from a content-
ed, albeit disillusioned,
guy to an unhinged,
overly reliant lover.
Though brilliantly
acted and directed, what
is most remarkable is
