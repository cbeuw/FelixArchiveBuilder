I
found myself in the
in the middle of an
AIESEC reunion,
right in the heart
of Alger, when this tall
Algerian man approaches
me in Portuguese. I was
not expecting that at all,
as the spoken language
at this meeting was either
English, French or Arabic.
A week had passed since
I left Portugal to do vol-
unteering in Algeria for
one and a half months,
and I must say, I really
felt nostalgic when I
heard a random “Olá” and
“Obrigado”. It was the
perfect way to break the
ice, we started chatting
and this man shared about
his time in Portugal (with
AIESEC as well) and
about his visits to Lisboa,
Porto and Sesimbra.
His name was Rabah,
he gave me his contact
and proposed a trip to the
Kabylie area - at the time
I was in the Arabic region
of Algeria.
Some weeks had passed
and I had not seen Rabah
in a while, my volunteer
experience was coming to
an end soon, so I figured I
should either join another
project or perhaps travel.
While thinking about my
future weeks in Algeria,
Rabah came to mind
and I texted him. For my
surprise he kindly replied
saying that he was going
to Tizi Ouzo – a Kabylie
area in the middle of the
mountains - and proposed
once again for me to join.
I gladly accepted his
invitation and not even a
week after finishing my
volunteer work, I was on
my way to Kabylie.
Rabah and a friend
picked me up in a
two-seat van, so I took
this journey in the back of
the van, with no windows.
Luckily, the van had a
side door I could open, so
my five-hour journey was
spent legs hanging outside
the van just contemplating
the view on my way to the
mountains.
When we reached the
Kabylie region, all women
wore colourful and flowy
beautiful dresses. Rabah
tells me that his village
and the others nearby, are
located in a zone called
Portugal. Being told such
a coincidence while I was
taking in all the magic of
this place, I felt stuck in a
moment of immense joy.
Rabah introduced me to
his cousins and then more
“It seemed
to me as an
experience I
couldn’t say no
to”
cousins and even more
cousins after that, and
then we finally headed to
his house. It was a house
with no electricity and
no water, with a fountain
just half a mile away. It
was summer, so none of
it mattered. That night we
went to see some friends
that turned out to be great
musicians; they also lived
in the mountains and
they even had their own
tobacco farm. We spent
a really pleasant night
drinking wine, smoking
homemade shisha and
listening to great music
(even bossa-nova), all
while under a sky full
of stars so clear it felt
unreal - not easy to find
nowadays.
Another night had
passed and I moved back
to Alger, spent some
days exploring there and
moved to Bejaia, also in
the Kabylie area, for a
week. Bejaia is a port city
by the mediterranean sea.
I spent four incredible
days there, mastering the
art of preparing shisha, so
much so that by the end of
it, I couldn´t even stand
the smell of it anymore.
At this point, Rabah
called me for one last
trip to the Kabylie moun-
tains, a weeding he said.
It seemed to me as an
experience that I couldn´t
say no to. I found myself
again in Portugal away
from Portugal (meaning
that Kabylie area), where
the people dress with
colourful, flowy, dancing
clothes. On this day there
seemed to be more people
than before, an explosion
of colour. We were near
this shop where I bought
some “Cheema”, which is
pure tobacco powder that
you put right in your gums
and wait until you feel
this hit of nicotine rushing
through you.
Rabah had left to greet
some of his cousins, so
I found a quiet staircase
near the shop and tried
some more “Cheema”.
More and more of these
colourful dressed woman
seemed to keep gathering,
and the more they appear,
the more I felt the nicotine
rushing. The colours, the
smells, the nicotine and
adrenaline rush, it all
seemed like one beautiful
Pollock’s paint right in
front of me.
Less than 10 minutes
had passed, Rabah returns
and we go for the greatest
couscous meal I’ve ever
had – I have been trying
to copy this same kind of
couscous but I am light
years away of achieving
it! During the meal, I had
the opportunity to meet
more of Rabah’s cousins,
communicating using my
very limited French and
improvised sign language.
It is impressive how much
we can learn from others
even when we don’t speak
the same language!
At night time, after the
wedding, there was this
big dance competition.
The woman, dressed with
colourful yet barely-there
clothing, were now
singing and dancing in a
very seductive way, while
the man were sitting,
chatting and very much
enjoying each perfor-
mance.
While I was as well,
Rabah invited me for
some “Haraam” (which
is the Arabic word for
breaking the Islamic
rules). Cousins and drinks
appeared out of nowhere,
and we drank in a hidden
place while hearing the
women singing and
clapping their hands. I
don’t actually remember
what happened after that,
but Rabad tells me I spoke
about mathematics with
a cousin that could only
speak Arabic and Kabyle.
Somehow we understood
each other at that time and
this was definitely one
of the best experiences I
have ever had!
The following day I
moved back to Alger, two
days after that I moved
back to Portugal (this time
my country), and now,
almost four years later, I
can still feel the intensity
of those magical, soul-fill-
ing, colourful mountains
painted by women, by
simplicity and a few drops
of Kabylie madness.
