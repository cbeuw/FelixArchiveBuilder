O
n Saturday
9th February,
the much an-
ticipated 70th
annual edition of the Hyde
Park Relays, hosted by
Imperial College Cross
Country and Athletics,
smashed onto the scene.
With over 80 teams and
nearly 500 participants, it
was once again a roaring
success for the club.
This event holds a
special place in Imperial
runners’ hearts, with the
first edition dating back to
the late 1940s and the or-
ganising committee deter-
mined to make this year’s
edition as memorable as
possible to vanquish last
year’s demons as the 2018
race had to be cancelled
due to the notorious Beast
from the East.
As January drew to its
end and the final details
had been arranged, the
weather forecast was
looking good and hopes
were high for this historic
event.
After an intense week
of food preparation, h-bar
decoration, race-pack
making and coordination
with all attendees, the big
day arrived at a frighten-
ing pace. With an early
start from the organisers
to set up registration and
bring the food, the crowds
started arriving at 10 in the
morning to Metric so they
could sign their teams in.
Soon enough, all teams
had registered and made
their way to the Bandstand
in Hyde Park where the
race would soon begin.
As the clocks struck
1pm,therecentlyretrieved
Hyde Park Relays Horn
was sounded, as per tra-
dition, to mark the start of
the race, as the first runner
from each of the 85 teams
stormed off in a stampede
with cheers of teammates
spreading across the park.
The course was newly
certified as officially 5km,
meaning many runners
were eager to set personal
best times.
As the first runners
made it to the end of their
leg, Daniel Mulryan from
Imperial Men’s A team
was leading the race with
what would earn him the
fastest leg of the day in
15:16, followed closely
by the Cambridge team,
as he gave the baton to
Mihaly Ormay. In the
third leg of the Men’s A
team Niki Faulkner ran a
pacey 15:40 leg, winning
him the prize baton for
3rd fastest leg of the day.
coming ahead of all the
other London Universi-
ties.
Imperial Men’s B team
come home in a terrific
7th place, led by Men’s
Captain Jack McKeon,
which served as a good
motivation boost before
BUCS Indoors Athletics
and the last London Cross
Country League of the
season.
On the ladies’side, new
PBs were ran by Stephanie
Hewitt with an awesome
19:24 who is also going to
compete in BUCS indoors
this weekend, star fresher
Alix Vermeulen who ran
an absolutely incredible
18:52, improving her 5k
PB by 40 seconds, Social
Secretary Jessica Eichel
with 21:34 and Pati Santos
with a speedy 24:32.
The Imperial Women’s
A team of Stephanie
Hewitt, Inga Van den
Bossche, Chloe Baker
and Alix Vermeulen won
themselves the bronze
baton as the 3rd fastest
Women’s Team behind
Cambridge and UCL
who ran crazy fast legs,
whilst Imperial Mixed
A team finished as the
fastest Mixed Team with
James Millet, Duncan
Ingram, Tom Binnie, last
year’s Club Captain Alex
Mundell, Social Secre-
tary Liv Papaioannou
and Euan Bell. Massive
congratulations go to
everyone!
Once all the runners
had crossed the finish line,
the masses headed back
to Metric for the prize
ceremony and sandwich-
es.
After the much needed
showers and a quick
dinner, the Imperial crew
headed to h-bar for the
final decoration install-
ments and some early
pints, with the after-party
ready to start at 8pm fea-
turing beer pong, drinking
from the HPR Horn and
tankard by the organisers,
and ICXCAC’s favourite
DJs - Niall Woodward and
Dema Ushchapovskyy
- who were absolutely
fantastic and made the
night a girthy one.
Overall, the day was
a huge success from all
points of view; the organ-
isers would like to extend
a huge thank you to
everyone from ICXCAC
and beyond who helped
throughout the organisa-
tion process and during
the day. The Club would
also like to congratulate
the Hyde Park Relays
Organisers Henry Hart
and Aymeric Regnier
for all their hard work in
planning the Relays (and
also writing this article!)
– the race could not have
happened without them.

worthy Cambridge op-

team putting in smashing
performances as Mihaly
finished in 17:02, Charlie
McFadzean in 17:16,
Daniel Garcia in 17:03
and Club Captain Fergus
