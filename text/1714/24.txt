Academy at
LSE (London School of
Economics) hosted a talk
titled ‘The War on Food
Waste’, with 3 entre-
preneurs from start-ups
tackle food waste. These
companies included
ODDBOX, DayOld, and
OLIO, each represented
by their founders or board
members.
Food waste is becoming
an increasingly hot topic,
especially in the UK
where there is growing
societal awareness about
its consequences on the
planet. In fact, if food
waste was a country, it
would be the third biggest
contributor to climate
change just after the
United States and China.
A brief introduction to
the three companies:
ODDBOX aims to
reduce food waste from
the farm, by sending
produce that do not live up
to supermarket standards
to its subscribers across
London.
DayOld collects artisan
pastries from bakeries,
that would also otherwise
get thrown out. These are
then provided as catering
for company events or
given to people suffering
food poverty. It’s shocking
to think that bakeries such
as GAIL’s were throwing
out up to 20 perfectly
edible loaves of bread
each day, before DayOld
decided to aprtner up with
them.
Finally, OLIO is a
“Food tinder” app, as
their business develop-
ment manager Liam Jones
put sit. Individuals and
supermarkets list foods
in their homes/shops that
they no longer want, so
that someone else in the
neighbourhood who may
want it can have it.
Interestingly, all three
companies are tackling
food waste, but at dif-
ferent levels of the food
supply chain: ODDBOX
on the farm, DayOld in
the stores, and OLIO in
the homes.
One of the major issues
discussed in the talk was
the complex reality of
managing both social and
economic welfare in these
businesses. DayOld men-
tioned that their company
is too commercial to
receive social enterprise
funding but is also not
economically profitable
enough to attract large
numbers of investors. To
combat this, they are cur-
rently relying heavily on
their extensive volunteer
network. The benefit is
that this enables nurturing
of close inter-personal
relationships as well as
encouraging commitment
from volunteers. The
speaker from DayOld
acknowledged that this
element of their business
is appealing to customers
(such as the companies
they cater for).
Personally, what I
found more shocking was
the fact that 16 of the full-
time staff at OLIO have
little to no pay, because
it is currently a free app.
Their representative
speaker made clear that
eventually their business
will have to be mone-
tized in order to expand.
Another issue OLIO
faces is the maintainence
of a high standard of risk
management, because
food exchange happens
at a very local scale, so
people have to be respon-
sible with what they give/
take. When they work
with supermarkets such as
Sainsbury’s to take their
unwanted food, a business
donor agreement is used
to ensure food safety.
Thus, it seems appropriate
to conclude that managing
a start-up involved in
social welfare has its fair
share of difficulties.
However, the main
point of the talk was to
show that with the right
business strategies it is
possible to overcome the
hardships and slowly, but
surely, grow like these
three companies.
All three speakers
made a very inspiring
point on the power of
having multiple food
welfare social enterprises
at different levels of the
food supply chain. As the
representative of DayOld
put it, “All three of our
companies are not com-
peting against each other.
Rather, we are competing
together against food
waste”. This statement
was followed by the im-
portance of small start-up
companies with a similar
mission, to collaborate ef-
fectively in order to raise
awareness.
Of course, it must be ac-
knowledged that the lack
of competition and scope
for collaboration is more
specific for ODDBOX,
DayOld and OLIO as they
focus on different stages
of the supply chain. For
example, OLIO did state
that “Too good to go”-
another app that provides
consumers with food that
is about to go bad (for
a cheaper price than the
original), is one of their
competitors. But gener-
ally, because these com-
panies are not motivated
purely by economic gains,
they are more amenable to
working together.
Furthermore, the
co-founder of ODDBOX,
Emilie Vanpoperinghe,
optimistically pointed
out that consumers are
increasingly beginning
to take interest in sus-
tainability conscious
companies. This leads to
a positive feedback loop
wherein businesses grad-
ually adapt to these needs,
providing sustainable
products, which further
raises awareness amongst
consumers.
Overall, the talk was
fairly casual, yet inform-
ative and inspiring. I
believe there is still a lot
of potential for more start-
ups to take their place in
the expanding niche of
sustainable business, and
act as a driving force for
societal good.
