Despite increasing diversity in many industries, the literary scene is still white-dominated. Books writer Rahul
Mehta explores the reasons why and what we can do about it.
D
espite the
power of
prose and
verse to drag
us from our seat on the
Tube (or grim university
flat) to the Victorian
slums or outer sectors
of the Galactic Empire,
British literature is still
being held back. While
the characters in books
transcend time and
space, the non-fictional
people who write and
publish the books suffer
far greater restrictions in
terms of diversity.
The data is damning.
The ‘Writing The
Future’ report into
diversity in the literary
world was published in
2015, and it made for
stark reading. At the
time, only 4% of guests
at literary festivals were
from a black, Asian, or
minority ethnic (BAME)
background. Malorie
Blackman, author of the
young adult novel series
Noughts and Crosses and
co-author of the report,
lamented a decline in
representation at these
events. Rianna Walcott
is the co-editor of The
Colour Of Madness, a
literary anthology about
BAME mental health.
She speaks of a notable
absence of people of
colour on discussion
panels at literary events.
Perhaps that’s unsur-
prising, considering
that no books written
by ethnic minorities
were recommended for
World Book Day, nor
World Book Night. It
seems that the ‘World’
does not extend beyond
the West’s shores. In
fairness, the event
organisers complained
that no publisher had
put forward any books
by writers of colour. No
wonder, when BAME
writers struggle to
even start their literary
careers, with 53% of
this group without an
agent, compared to 37%
of white authors. Thus,
the lack of diversity
at literary festivals is
really only the tip of the
iceberg - the issue of di-
versity permeates every
level of publishing.
So how do we respond
to poor representation
across the literary board?
We can develop our own
spaces. The Jhalak Prize
for books by writers
of colour offers such
a platform for growth,
offering a £1000 prize
for the winner. The
2018 winner, Reni Ed-
do-Lodge, was shortlist-
ed for other awards for
her book, Why I’m No
Longer Talking to White
People About Race.
For those not fortunate
enough to win the prize,
there are other funding
options. Nikesh Shukla,
editor and contributor to
The Good Immigrant, a
collection of essays by
Brits from immigrant
communities, reached
204% of his funding
target through the
crowd-funding publish-
er, Unbound. Whether
it’s recognition or re-
sources, there is always
the option of finding
support through one’s
communities.
However, prizes and
crowd-funding carry
their own problems.
Nikesh Shukla fears that
his “skin colour is being
seen as a trend and not
something that’s about a
societal good”. Are these
initiatives performative
virtue-signalling by
newly ‘woke’ corpo-
rations, or affirmative
action? For comedienne
Shappi Khorsandi, the
idea of attaching a price
to one’s skin colour
led to her withdrawing
her submission for the
Jhalak Prize. Tokenism
extends beyond concerns
about perceived success.
In the ‘Writing the
Future’ report, several
authors complained
about being expected to
write solely about their
race, and specifically
through a colonial lens.
One author spoke of
how, after refusing to
write about the British
Raj and racial deference
of the governess-high
maharajah dynamic, she
resorted to approaching
publishers in India. Her
book was subsequently
published and enjoyed

Review: The Colour of Madness:
Exploring BAME Mental Health in
the UK
guide for the practitioners who care for them. It comes
as no surprise that it is being taken up by hospital wards
and universities alike. Hopefully, this book will set a
precedent for more writers to come forward, to describe
their unique journey. Long overdue! - RM
The Colour Of
Madness reminds us of
one of the greatest powers
of storytelling: giving a
voice to the voiceless.
Through anthology of
verse, prose, and arts,
this book is a rallying cry
to the alienated and the
alone. In the perfect storm
of cultural stigma, mental
health cuts, and rising
racism and xenophobia,
this collection of writings
serves as welcome refuge
for the vulnerable, and a
success. This dubious
notion of authenticity
perpetuates stereotypes
and restricts the inclu-
sion of new voices. But,
how do we increase
diversity in an equitable
manner that neither
punishes white authors,
nor fetishises BAME
authors, and still ensures
that our society remains
a thriving community of
literature?
The report’s rec-
ommendation sums it
up best. The authors
advocate for a greater
recruitment drive,
allowing people of
colour to take up man-
agerial positions. In
doing so, the gatekeep-
ers of the literary world
would be more open to a
diverse range of submis-
sions. In the meantime,
publishing bodies
can undergo audits to
identify cultural bias in
their selection process.
Beyond the recom-
mendations, grants and
interest-free loans can
help working-class
ethnic minorities to
pursue literary careers.
Penguin Random House
offers 6-month intern-
ships to ethnic minority
applicants, with Faber,
Harper Collins, and
Hachette following
suit. While only 4% of
children books have
BAME characters, there
is still hope for improve-
ment. In the last 3 years,
BAME staff have in-
creased from 8% to 12%
in publishing spaces.
Books can be a place
of refuge, education,
and solidarity. As the
wise, ever-quotable
James Baldwin said:
“You think your pain
and your heartbreak are
unprecedented in the
history of the world, but
then you read”. I can
think of no better reason
than that to bring more
voices to the fore.

The Colour of Madness - “This cannot be a conclusion.
It is closer to a beginning.”

about BAME mental health, alongside Dr Samara Linton. Here she chats to Books writer Rahul Mehta about her
work.

Rahul Mehta: Where
did the idea for The
Colour of Madness
come from?
Rianna Walcott: I was
giving a talk in Edinburgh
about mental health in the
creative industry, and I
was the only black woman
on the panel. People
seemed interested in my
perspective, and I was
approached by my future
publisher. She suggested
an anthology dedicated
to BAME experiences of
mental health.
It was definitely a
BAME-led project: by
us, for us, about us. My
co-editor, Samara, had
written as a journalist and
an academic about black
mental health, so we came
in with both personal
and formal experience
on writing about mental
health.
How did you plan and
organise your vision?
We started with seeking
funding. It was largely
crowd-funded, with some
funds coming from the
publisher and creative
arts funding. Samara and
I handled the publicity in
BAME spaces. Most of
the press about our book
was by women of colour
in their spaces: Media Di-
versified, gal-dem, Black
Ballad. We also featured
in The Guardian, the
Metro, and the BBC. But
first of all, we wanted it to
be in the hands of people
of colour.
We had Facebook
focus groups with over
100 individuals. Samara
and I held brainstorming
sessions about the book’s
design and organised a
large digital campaign to
get submissions. We went
beyond academic spaces:
we went to service-user
led charities, to find people
of different backgrounds.
Were you informed by
personal experiences
of mental health?
Everyone on the team
had some experience of
mental health conditions,
including depression and
anxiety. This was not just
an outside interest. In
Samara’s case, she was
able to see things as a
patient AND a practition-
er. The reason we make
such a good partnership
is because she has the
medical background
while I have the literary
background (Rianna has
an undergraduate and
Masters degree in English
Literature).
I’m impressed by the
diversity of voices in
the book.
The book reflects
who is most comfortable
talking about their mental
health. For example, we
had tons of submissions
from black and Asian
women, but barely any
from black and Asian
men. Male contributors
tend to be practitioners
(e.g. Asian doctors), or
LGBT+. Most contribu-
tors were second or third
generation immigrants.
But we have lots of
people across different
intersections. This high-
lights the diversity in
spaces like the black com-
munity, e.g. the difference
between those of African
and Caribbean descent.
It brings a lot of nuance
that is missing from the
conversation.
Whatwasyourbiggest
obstacle?
Money! We are all
novices to this, and no
one could have known
the demand would be
this high. We have had
four print runs (unheard
of in small print press).
We have grown from our
mistakes and learned a
lot from the publishing
process.
One funny thing is that
a lot of white men submit-
ted, some even pretending
to be BAME. We’d
respond by pointing them
to our Patreon. If you’re
not going to support us
with coin, then what are
you doing?
What’s your best
memory?
People coming up to
us at our events, in tears,
because of how much it
means to them. A contrib-
utor will be reading their
piece at an event, and
someone in the audience
will begin to weep a little
bit. This is the first time
that someone has been
able to say this out loud,
the first time that someone
has been seen. It’s been
an incredible privilege to
facilitate that.
You recently said:
“This cannot be a
conclusion. It is closer
to a beginning.” What
is your plan for the
book?
We want to build on
previous achievements.
It’s on a university’s
syllabus; someone even
took it into Parliament!
We want to see it every-
where, so that everyone
understands that our
experiences are unique.
The book is the tip of the
iceberg though, with only
58 perspectives. Imagine
how many millions more
there are!
