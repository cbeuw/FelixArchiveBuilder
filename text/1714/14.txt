Dior: Designer of Dreams
Enter a dream world of elegance and glamour
I
n the world today,
haute couture is one
of the last repositories
of the marvellous,’
said Christian Dior in
1957. The dresses of the
House of Dior combine
fantasy and futurism – the
exoticism of far-flung
countries, the allure of
delicate flowers, and the
old-world grandeur of
eras long past. It is not
merely a dress that is sold
to us, but a dream; not just
an everyday garment to be
worn, but a rare piece of
‘ephemeral architecture’.
This February, the
V&A plays host to the
largest retrospective of
the House of Dior ever
seen in the UK. Spanning
from Christian Dior’s
first collection in 1947
to the work of current
creative director Maria
Grazia Chiuri, it features
over 200 hand-stitched
garments drawn from both
the Dior archives and the
collections of the V&A.
The exhibition opens
with none other than
Dior’s Bar Suit, an
emblem of his revolu-
tionary ‘New Look’.
Presented in his debut col-
lection, the ultra-feminine
silhouette with its cinched
waist and full skirt was a
radical departure from the
austere, utilitarian look
of the postwar period. Its
unapologetic decadence
– a single dress requiring
yards of fabric to create –
sparked protests and took
1950s Paris by storm.
This explosive start is
but the opener to eleven
carefully-curated rooms of
Dior design, all exquisite-
ly presented in immersive
sets designed by Nathalie
Crinière. The second
room, for instance, show-
cases dresses that Dior
designed over the course
of his career. It is strik-
ingly presented: the entire
room is dark, leaving the
focus squarely on the
dresses, each enclosed
within a mirrored box
and lit by the soft glow of
fluorescent light.
While many of the
pieces were showcased at
the Musée des Arts Déco-
ratifs in Paris last year,
the London exhibition is
much altered from its Paris
rendition. V&A curator
Oriole Cullen shows off
Dior’s ties to Britain with
a section dedicated to ex-
ploring his self-confessed
Anglophilia. Prominently
displayed here is the
extravagant off-shoulder
dress famously worn by
Princess Margaret on her
21st birthday, as well as
dresses worn by fashion-
able English clients such
as Nancy Mitford and
Margot Fonteyn.
Of course, this exhi-
bition is not just about
Christian Dior alone.
Beyond the first few
rooms, the designs of the
man himself are seamless-
ly blended with those of
the six creative designers
who succeeded him.
We view the dresses by
themes that have inspired
each successive genera-
tion of designers: flowers,
18th century court
fashion, cultures from
around the world. Yves
Saint Laurent, Gianfranco
Ferré, John Galliano… all
brilliant designers in their
own right. An entire room
gives us the opportunity
to see their individual
interpretations of the Dior
style, displaying dresses
by each of the designers
alongside quotes and a
brief biography.
Crinière’s sets continue
to amaze, with ‘The
Garden’ room featuring
delicate paper sprays of
wisteria cascading from
the ceiling, and ‘Diorama’
showing off an impressive
colour-coded cabinet of
shoes, bags and tiny scale
models of iconic dresses.
The oft-forgotten ateliers
get a look-in too, with a
floor-to-ceiling display of
white linen toiles (dress
prototypes) used in the
making of actual Dior
pieces.
But the best is saved
for last. At the end of the
exhibition, we enter a
dazzling grand ballroom.
Elegantly dressed man-
nequins stand in groups
around us, decked out in
the unashamedly opulent
imagination of Dior
designers from past to
present. Mirrors multiply
their images infinitely,
so that we feel like
we’re actually at a ball,
surrounded by beautiful
people in their beautiful
gowns. From Dior’s
multi-petalled Junon
(1949) to Galliano’s
Silvery Water Harlequin
(1998) and more recent
ballgowns worn by ce-
lebrities on the red carpet,
they stand proudly under
an ever-changing ceiling
– one moment the deep
blue of a starry sky, the
next a Renaissance fresco
bathed in golden light. It
speaks to the timelessness
of Dior’s designs.
This is a theme under-
scored by the final dress,
a delicate confection of
pleated silk tulle entitled
Éventail de vos hasards
(Fan of Your Chances).
Created by Chiuri for the
Shanghai presentation
of her Summer 2018
collection, it was in fact
inspired by a handpainted
fan designed by Dior
himself in 1950. Like the
fan, the dress too bears his
signature: a connection
from past to present.
From the iconic Bar Suit
all the way to the halls of
Shanghai, the Dior style
has remained a classic in
the ever-evolving world
of fashion.
Dior: Designer of
Dreams provides a beauti-
fully curated, comprehen-
sive look into the world
of the renowned designer.
The crowds flocking to
the Sainsbury wing are a
testament to his enduring
legacy. With the V&A just
minutes from Imperial,
why not take a break
from the dreary world of
lectures? Step into Dior’s
dream world of elegance
and glamour, if only for a
little while.
