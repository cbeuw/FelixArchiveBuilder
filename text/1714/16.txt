Surreal and beautiful: The Good Person of Szechwan
Brecht’s political commentary, boldly executed
H
ow can a
good person
survive in a
world which
is intrinsically evil? This
is the question Bertolt
Brecht poses to us in his
play The Good Person of
Szechwan. Set in Sichuan,
it tells the story of how
the gods reward a poor
prostitute Shen Te, ‘the
only good person in the
city’, with enough money
to buy a small tobacco
shop. Unfortunately,
Shen Te’s kindness is
immediately exploited by
all and sundry, so that she
is forced to invent an alter
ego – her straight-talking,
merciless cousin Shui
Ta – to restore order
and rescue the business.
Despite her reluctance to
bring out Shui Ta, ‘he’ has
to stay for ever-increasing
periods of time, eventual-
ly subsuming the virtuous
Shen Te. There is, after
all, no place for the good
in a world such as ours.
For those unfamiliar
with Brecht, the German
playwright was best
known for his ‘epic
theatre’, highly political
theatre that aimed to get
the viewer to think criti-
cally about contemporary
issues. He popularised
the Verfremdungseffekt
(‘estrangement effect’):
by constantly breaking
the fourth wall, audiences
were prevented from im-
mersing themselves in the
events of the play, forcing
them to think critically
about what was being
presented on stage. Brecht
went so far with the ‘V-
effect’ as to read stage
directions out loud, hold
up placards to indicate
subtext, and rearrange
the set and lighting in full
view of the audience.
While highly influen-
tial in concept, his plays
are rarely performed in
full nowadays for obvious
reasons – people aren’t
very fond of going to
theatres to be lectured.
Yury Butusov’s exu-
berant rendition of The
Good Person of Szechwan
breathes fresh life into
Brecht’s parable-play.
Ambitious in scope and
buzzing with energy, his
direction has the talented
actors of the Moscow
Pushkin Drama Theatre
singing, dancing, and
even riding bicycles
across stage. The acting
is at times hilarious,
at times touching, but
always fierce. Butusov
achieves the V-effect not
by stripping the play of
its entertainment value,
but rather by kicking it up
to eleven and sprinkling
on a touch of the surreal.
A three-hour long play
in German and Russian
really shouldn’t be this
enjoyable. Part vaudeville
act, part oratorical play,
Butusov manages to make
Brechtian theatre both
entertaining and highly
accessible.
In true Brechtian
fashion, the set designed
by Alexander Shiskin
contributes to the sense
of disconnect between
audience and actors.
Elements of the set are
scattered loosely about
the stage and picked up
as necessary to play their
part in different scenes. A
single door stands in for an
entire house; microphones
stand ready for the cast to
grab when they burst into
song. Gigantic images,
thematically related to
what’s happening on
stage, are projected darkly
on the back screen. A nod
to Brechtian placard-hold-
ing, but so subtle that you
don’t notice till you look
up and it’s suddenly there.
This being a theatre
company from Moscow,
the play itself is in
Russian, but the original
German songs by Paul
Dessau are kept. The
German pronunciation
occasionally leaves
something to be desired,
but thank goodness for
English subtitles! Musical
director Igor Gorsky has
a lot on his plate: not just
Dessau’s German songs,
but an entire soundtrack
of jazz numbers, revues
and rock music which all
enliven the play.
Miss Mi Tzu (Irina
Petrova), Shen Te’s
upper-class landlady, has
a hilarious theme song
that plays whenever she
minces across the stage,
while the leather-clad
policeman (Aleksey
Rakhmanov) belts out
his lines like a rock star
from the ‘70s. Lively
jazz sets the scene for
wild cavorting by the
local ne’er-do-wells, who
all want a piece of Shen
Te’s newfound wealth;
meanwhile, Ryuichi Saka-
moto’s aching ‘Merry
Christmas Mr Lawrence’
is played when Shen Te
falls in love with her
pilot (who sadly, like the
rest, only wants to exploit
her). This is all manfully
carried out by a four-per-
son live band who are a
constant presence on stage
throughout the play, and
should really be credited
in the programme.
The staging is lavish,
awash with beautiful,
surreal images. Wong, the
water-seller (Alexander
Matrosov), frequently and
symbolically makes use
of dry sand. Rice rains
from the sky as a god
rides a bicycle through a
forest of gaunt trees. Shen
Te (Alexandra Ursulyak)
converses with her alter
ego Shui Ta who, improb-
ably, is walking calmly on
a treadmill in the middle
of a forest. In one of the
most dramatic scenes,
empty cigarette packets
rain down like gold,
while Shen Te, alone on
stage but for a full-length
mirror, confronts her own
reflected image.
Dualityisamajortheme
of the play, and Ursulyak
plays both sides of her
character with aplomb. It
is easy to see the conflict
between her good-hearted
nature and her inability to
survive while being true
to herself; the harsh reality
of Brecht’s world inexora-
bly crushes the goodness
out of her. Matrosov as
the destitute water-seller
alternates between a
pitiful cripple and a sort
of messenger to the gods.
The three gods here are
ingeniously replaced by
a single actress (Ana-
stasia Lebedeva) who
appears thrice in different
incarnations, all equally
enigmatic.
Butusov’s compelling
production makes us
laugh, but also forces us to
think. When Brecht wrote
his play in 1941, war was
breaking out around the
world. Just months after
the first performance
of The Good Person of
Szechwan, the United
States would formally
declare war on Japan in
response to the attack on
Pearl Harbour. Events
today are not quite as
bleak, but it is a question
worth considering in any
era. Is our world so cruel
that there is no place for a
good person in it? Either
they must go mad, as with
Prince Myshkin in Dosto-
evsky’s The Idiot, or they
must turn evil themselves,
as with Shen Te.
When called upon, the
gods prove to be useless,
and Brecht turns to the
audience to demand an
answer for our para-
doxical world. Butusov
condenses Brecht’s final
call to action into a single,
powerful word from Shen
Te: ‘help!’
While the Moscow
Pushkin Drama Theatre
has sadly left London,
they will be back again in
June, this time to perform
Francis Beaumont’s 17th
century parody ‘The
Knight of the Burning
Pestle’. As this brief visit
has demonstrated, their
irrepressible verve and
energy are sure to make it
relevant for modern times.
