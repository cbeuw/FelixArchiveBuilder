L
ove is perhaps
the most integral
and celebrated
part of the human
condition. People have
been known to try to ex-
press and capture it since
800BC when the oldest
recorded love poem was
created in Mesopotamia.
It is without question
that love is a unique
experience for all, and so
countless artists have pro-
duced their own beautiful
interpretations of it over
the years. However, not
all love was deemed to be
acceptable for the eyes of
the public, and waves of
censorship have plagued
the past.
Perhaps the most
obvious repression is of
homosexuality which was
actually only decriminal-
ised for men in the UK
52 years ago, and even
after this, considered
scandalous or taboo.
The daring nature of art,
though, meant that such
legislation did not deter
gay artists from exploring
their sexuality and they
instead adopted sophisti-
cated code and symbolism
to relay their desires.
Common symbols include
the peacock feather and
green carnations. These
were worn by men to
identify themselves
without being caught,
and were also famously
included in pieces such
as Charles Ricketts
and Charles Shannon
as Medieval Saints by
Edmund Dulac.
Another icon used to
undermine censorship
was drag performance.
Andy Warhol, a gay man
himself, was a champion
of the queer aesthetic and
his bold representations
of Marilyn Monroe as a
pop drag queen, amongt
others, was a true rebellion
against the homophobic
views of America.
Yet, the censorship, and
even fear, of homosexual-
ity is in no way limited to
the 1900s; the rich history
of queer art extends far
into history and into the
present day with surpris-
ing differences in views.
The Ancient Greeks
produced a plethora of gay
art and had a rather unique
view of romantic rela-
tionships to other ancient
cultures. We could go as
far to say that same-sex
attraction was revelled in,
with often explicit scenes
being depicted in pottery
and other art forms. Most
notable is the complex
and emotional relation-
ship between Achilles and
Patroclus in Homer’s The
Iliad.
By contrast, records
of lesbian relationships
in Greek art and, in fact,
generally are very sparse.
We can only deduce
their existence from the
love poetry of Sappho
and Plato’s comments
on women with ‘female
attachments’.
Inthepresent,wewould
consider gay relationships
to be commonly accepted
but even recently, repres-
sion has been experienced
in the art world. In 2010,
the Hide/Seek: Difference
and Desire in American
Portraiture exhibition,
considering the fluidity of
gender and sexuality, was
displayed in the Smithso-
nian’s National Portrait
Gallery. Its presence
actually sparked talk of a
congressional review of
the Smithsonian’s funding
and led to the removal of
one of the pieces, Fire in
my Belly by David Wojn-
arowicz- from the exhibi-
tion.Although it is evident
that complete freedom
of expression is still a
fiction, other installations
have aimed to represent
such controversial themes
and this includes Tate
Britain’s Queer British
Art (1861-1967) in 2017.
Of course, gay and
lesbian relationships are
not the only supposedly
‘non-traditional’ rela-
tionships to have been
considered distasteful.
The plain absence of
black relationships and
interracial relationships
is equally shocking and
upsetting to acknowledge.
Black relationships,
regardless of orientation
or nature, are largely
missing from art collec-
tions. The extent of this is
captured perfectly in the
1992 painting Slow Dance
by Kerry James Marshall,
dubbed one of the greatest
depictions of lovers in
art by the Artsy database.
It shows an intimate
moment between an Af-
rican-American couple as
they enjoy a slow-dance
in a living room surround-
ed by bright colours and
swirling music notes.
The mundane tone and
simplicity of the scene
stresses the normality of
such images and cries out
against racist attitudes. It
has a clear mission to en-
courage such representa-
tion in the mainstream and
this was revolutionary.
This act was taken
further by Leslie Barlow
to celebrate interracial
relationships in her mixed
media series Loving,
created in 2015. This
series is the namesake
of the famous American
court case of Loving vs
Virginia in 1967, when
the Supreme Court finally
deemed anti-miscege-
nation (anti-interracial
relations) laws to be
unconstitutional. To em-
phasise, it has been only
52 years since interracial
marriage was legalised in
the United States.
As with Marshall,
Barlow restricts her work
to uneventful and com-
monplace scenes with the
similarity that all of the
scenes are harmonious,
and the couples and
families are happy. And
this artist is not alone in
hereffortstocorrectpublic
opinion of race through
art. Donna Pinckley fights
through her Sticks and
Stones photo series. This
project is powerful in its
simplicity, capturing shots
of interracial couples in
muted black and white.
With each picture is a
caption containing a slur
or insult used against the
couple in question.
I could go on, but I
believe the point has been
made that love, although
generally celebrated, is
also villainised if not
fitting societal ideas
of ‘normal’. Love is a
personal experience that
can be queer, interracial,
open or otherwise seen
to be unconventional but
ultimately, art will find
a way to conquer taboos
and provide an outlet for
lovers of all types.
