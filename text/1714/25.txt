ust as a plant needs
water for growth,
so does a business
require capital to
expand. Debt and equity
are two sides of the same
coin. A company may
choose to finance itself
with debt or equity or a
combination of the two.
The company approaches
banks or investors for a
loan and/or to sell a stake
of the company to raise
capital.
Debt in simple terms,
refers to the amount of
money borrowed by the
borrower from the lender.
The debt agreement
usually involves the
repayment of the amount
borrowed plus interest
to the lender. Interest
is charged on debt as
compensation to the
lender for taking on the
risk of the loan while
also incentivizing quicker
repayments to reduce the
borrower’s overall interest
expense. The risk of a debt
refers to the probability of
the borrower defaulting,
i.e., the borrower being
unable to repay the
loan and/or its interest
payments. We are familiar
with debt in the form of
student loans, auto loans,
mortgages and credit card
debt. Businesses also
use debt to finance the
acquisition of assets, e.g.,
machinery, real-estate and
raw materials. In both
cases, the business and
the individual issue debt
while the bank takes on
the (carries the risk of)
debt in return for interest
payments.
Individuals, banks and
other institutions can
also take on the debt of
a business by purchasing
its bonds. Bonds are loans
in quarterly and annual
reports to allow investors
to gauge a company’s
short and long-term
financial health.
Like how one is wary
of lending money to a
consistently indebted
friend, a company with
too much debt is seen
as risky and financially
unhealthy and are termed
highly leveraged as debt
is leveraged to finance
operations. While not
every highly leveraged
company is a bad one,
leveraging makes future
debt more expensive
as potential investors
will expect a higher
return in exchange for
lending money to a risky
company.
Instead of issuing debt,
a company may choose
instead to sell a portion
of the company in return
for capital. Equity often
refers to a share or any
other form of investment
vehicle that represents
an ownership interest. If
one purchases a single
share in a company that
splits and sells 100% of
its ownership into 100
shares, one owns 1% of
the company. While debt
represents an obligation
to repay a loan, equity
representsownership.This
definition differentiates
holders of debt as the
debtors of the company
while holders of equity
as the owners. Holders
of equity are entitled to a
portion of profits as well
as voting rights on matters
pertaining to the company.
Shareholders are eligible
for dividend issuances and
voting rights at general
meetings. Dividends are
excess profits distributed
as cash-handouts per share
to reward shareholders
and incentivize their
continued vested interest
in the company.
The characteristics
mentioned above are
those of common shares.
Companies can also issue
a form of equity known
as preferred shares.
Preferred shares also
represent ownership of
the company. However,
preferred share-holders
are entitled to a fixed
dividend payment whilst
common share-holder
dividends are subject
to the company’s
performance and approval
by the board of directors.
Dividends on preferred
shares are pre-determined
and often larger than
those of common shares.
In times of insolvency,
the proceeds from the
liquidationofthecompany
first go to bondholders,
followed by preferred
shareholders and finally
through an Initial Public
Offering (IPO). The
shares of the company
are listed and traded on
a stock exchange for the
first time, representing the
initial “offering” of shares
for sale to the public,
also known as a primary
offering. The proceeds
of the sales go to the
issued by companies,
municipalities, states and
sovereign governments
to finance operations.
They have variable or
fixed interest payments.
They are an asset class
known as fixed-income
securities as they provide
periodic interest payments
at pre-determined interest
rates. Bonds can be traded
(bought and sold) publicly
on a stock exchange or
privately between private
parties.
Debt is found on a
company’s balance sheet
under the section of
liabilities. Liabilities are
split between current and
non-current, differing
in their settlement date.
Those due to be settled
within a year or less
are classified as current
while those due later
are non-current. Current
liabilities are useful for
gauging a company’s
short-term liquidity. Debt
can be found in a plethora
of vehicles as such bank
loans, notes (short,
medium and long term),
bond payables and lease
agreements on assets the
company is utilising but
does not own. These are
listed and elaborated upon

to common shareholders.
Hence, preferred shares
represent a greater claim
to a company’s assets
and earnings. As such,
preferred shareholders,
like bond holders, are not
given voting rights as they
are viewed as “less risky”
investments. The primary
means of issuing equity is

Companies may also
re-purchase their own
shares from the market
for a multitude of reasons.
It is viewed favourably
by investors as a sign
of “future value” of the
company, i.e., the board
of directors by virtue of
running the company,
expect the future value
of the shares to be higher
and purchases them for
re-issuance at a higher
market value in the future
via a secondary offering.
This allows the company
to increase its share capital
without having to dilute
shareholder ownership by
issuing more shares.
The big question
remains, which is better
for financing a company,
debt or equity? The
general rule is; debt is
cheaper than equity. This
is best understood with
an example. If a company
requires £30,000 pounds
to finance its business
operation, it could issue
£30,000 in bonds paying
an annual 5% interest or
it could sell a 10% stake
in its business. If the
company performs well
and makes £100,000 in
profit in a year, the bond
interest will be £1,500
while the 10% stake will
represent £10,000 of profit
owed to shareholders. The
company will have saved
£8500 in profit by issuing
debt instead of equity. In
this situation, the cost of
equity is more than the
cost of debt.
The key idea is; debt
repayments represent a
fixed-expense liability,
that is removed once the
debt is paid but equity is a
long-term obligation to the
shareholdersandadilution
of ownership as the
company is split amongst
more shareholders. These
could represent a boon or
a curse depending on the
company. Start-ups, small
players in large industries,
highlyleveragedfirms and
other young companies
with unstable cash flows
will find accessing cheap
debt, i.e., issuing debt at
low interest rates, near
impossible as investors
are not willing to part
with their money for a
risky company without
a proportionately higher
return. As a result, most
turn to venture capital for
financing, selling stakes
in their company in return
for capital. Larger, more
established firms have
predictable and reliable
cashflows that grant them
access to cheap debt and
are unlikely to issue new
equity.
Another aspect that
attractive.
Discount rates of the
central bank will influence
the use of debt. The central
bank requires financial
institutions to hold a
portion of money in the
reserves at the end of each
business day. This reserve
requirements ensures
banks have enough money
tucked away to meet
customer withdrawals.
The discount rate is the
interest rate central banks
charge banks and other
financial institutions
for loans to meet the
overnight requirements.
Fluctuations in the
discountratewillaffectthe
interest rates bank charge
on loans to companies.
If the economy requires
stimulation, the central
bank will lower the
discount rate. Since banks
can now loan money from
the central bank at a lower
rate, it encourages them
to lower their own rates
for customers, making
the debt market more
appealing. During times
of inflation, when the
economy needs to “slow
down”, the reverse is true
and a company may find
the interest rates on their
debt increase, thereby
increasing their cost of
debt.
Debt and equity,

structures vary largely
by industry. Cyclical
industries such as mining
and airlines are unsuited
for high amounts of
debt as the unstable
revenue streams creates
uncertainty surrounding
debt repayment. Banking
and insurance, however
require large amounts of
leverage, hence hight debt
is the norm. The role of
monitoring and optimisng
the capital structure falls
on the Chief Financial
Officer. This role is often

with the title Chief

to strike a delicate balance
