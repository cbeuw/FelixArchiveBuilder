A
fter a hefty
debate about
my paper, with
many a discus-
sion being had about if we
need Union reform, when
we need Union reform,
why we need Union
reform, and how we
should do Union reform,
the paper was passed,
with an amendment limit-
ing the scope of reform to
democratic engagement;
currently done through
Union Council and its
subcommittees.
If you missed my
article last week, here is
a quick summary why I
want to shake things up
at the Union. I believe
that the Union is currently
not doing a great job of
involving students in the
decision making process.
The procedure for the
passing of motions for
the improvement of the
student experience is often
bureaucratic, new changes
have to go through long
periods of exhaustive
and exhausting review
before being implemented
(often lasting as long as
or even longer than than
a year or two!) and are
incredibly inaccessible for
the average student. This
might mean that a change
you set in motion could
only be enacted after
you graduate. As a new
Council Rep last year,
I faced a steep learning
curve that barred me from
getting more involved and
this is an issue faced by
Council Reps every year,
as well as people on CSP
committees, Management
Groups, etc.
Union Council is the
central democratic body
of the Union. It’s where, in
theory, the work of Officer
Trustees (the elected
President + Deputy Pres-
idents) is scrutinised, and
where senior volunteers
pass policy for the Union.
However, over the last
few years it has become
increasingly clear that it
hasn’t been successful in
acting upon these princi-
ples, with some volunteers
feeling that it’s one great
big formality and that very
little is actually achieved.
I don’t believe this is to do
with the people elected on
to Council; the people on
Council are some of the
hard-working and com-
mitted volunteers I know,
and if they weren’t, you’d
expect the effectiveness to
fluctuate over the years.
The fact that it hasn’t been
effective despite having
effective individuals
sitting on it suggests that
the way Council is struc-
tured is the source of the
problem – the structure
of the Union’s current
democratic processes do
not allow for our students
to flourish and really lead
the Union.
Last week I put out a
call in my article calling
on students to come to
Council to show support
for my paper. I was
messaged by people who
said they were surprised
that they could just show
up to these meetings.
Despite the Union trying
to communicate this year
that anyone can come to
Council and propose a
policy paper, non-voting
member attendance has
continued to be virtually
non-existent. These are
the main reasons why I
think we need a better
democratic structure that
allows for grassroots
participation and for our
students to lead the way
in how the Union is run.
After I argued strongly for
change, Union Council
where it fails, what other
student Unions do better,
and most importantly:
how we can improve our
own Union. Whether it
be a modified version of
Council or something
completely different, by
the end of it we will come
up with a proposal that the
majority of the working
group will agree on, and
submit to Council for
it to be approved. Who
knows, it might be the last
thing Council passes in its
current form!
Any major changes to
the Union require a 2/3rd
majority vote at Council.
This is incredibly hard
to win, especially when
proposing something this
huge. This is why we
need to make sure that the
proposal has backing from
all kinds of students – such
as academic and wellbe-
ing reps, clubs and socie-
ties committee members,
management group vol-
unteers, council members,
Officer Trustees, and even
students who don’t hold an
elected role. The changes
will affect the way that
everyone participates with
the Union, so we need lots
of students to get involved
and make sure that we
get it right – after all, you
know better than we do
how you interact with the
Union!
So come along to the
discussions when you
want, contribute what you
can, and get involved with
a project that will make the
Union work better for you
in 2020 and beyond! Sign
up for the working group
at bit.ly/ICUReform, and
contact me at ab4616@
ic.ac.uk if you have any
questions or ideas for the
Union!

agreed and has approved a
process for reform.
Many senior volunteers
were concerned that
this reform would lead
nowhere, especially with
the spectre of third term
looming on the horizon.
Would it even be possible
to get the new structure
passed in time? This is
where you step in; the pro-
cedure to achieve a more
transparent, member-
led, and accessible
Union needs students
from all parts of campus
(and other campuses!) to
join in a “working group”.
This group would meet
regularly and discuss
