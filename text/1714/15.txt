Dark Laughs from ‘Pinter 7’
I
write these first words
at 10pm, having just
made it back from
‘Pinter 7’. It seems
that I’d have to at least
make a start on my article
now, not for issues of time
but to capture feeling
while it is still strong, for
what is the point of art if
not to inspire feeling?
I’ve left with a sense
of satisfaction and ex-
citement. The current
instalment of the ‘Pinter
at the Pinter’ series is
engaging and cleverly
humorous, complete with
an all-star cast and unique
narratives. Without
giving too much away,
the conclusions of both
short plays within this
performance - ‘A Slight
Ache’ and ‘The Dumb
Waiter’ - were powerful
and thought-provoking.
The performance
begins with ‘A Slight
Ache’, a radio play
focused on a respectable
couple, Flora (Gemma
Whelan) and Edward
(John Heffernan) and their
different, emotional reac-
tions to the appearance of
a strange match-seller. As
a radio play, the stage is
set in a recording studio,
but the audience is rapidly
transported to the home of
Edward and Flora, their
flowering garden and their
domestic lives. The play
sits somewhere between
the studio and this house,
with Whelan and Hef-
fernan dipping between
being Edward and Flora
and simply reciting lines
in the studio. The studio is
a powerful tool throughout
the story, with props being
actively used. The use of
sound props- like gravel
for the garden path- is par-
ticularly immersive and,
through contrasting tones
and timely entrances, add
a further comic element
to that of the characters
themselves.
Flora reacts with
kindness towards the
match-seller and this is in
complete contrast to the
paranoid panic of Edward,
who goes as far as to invite
him into confrontation.
This fear comes with ‘a
slight ache’ in Edward’s
eyes, a recurring issue
in the play and source of
constant tension.
Upon the disturbing end
of this first performance,
the stage quite literally
switches to a completely
new setting, a bare, grey
room. Within this place
are two men, Gus (Martin
Freeman) and Ben (Danny
Dyer). Through various
hints, we eventually learn
that these two men are
hired killers, waiting for
a call that their target has
arrived in the building.
The scenario quickly
becomes comical when
a dumb waiter begins
to send down orders for
various delicacies Gus
and Ben are unsurprising-
ly, unable to source. This
play, ‘The Dumb Waiter’,
is in contrast to the first
when it comes to dramatic
technique: light and sound
are used sparingly and
there is a heavy reliance
on the conversations
between Gus and Ben.
This pays off beautifully,
delivering a captivating
performance and building
a true fondness for the
pair in a very short time.
Where the two plays are
similar is in their dissent
into tension and chaos;
as the hour grows later,
stress boils over but still,
throughout, the comedy is
upheld; honestly, hearing
Freeman angrily shout
‘scampi!’ in the middle of
an argument is a highlight
of theatre itself.
The contrast between
the humour and dark
themes of ‘Pinter 7’ is
masterfully delivered by
talented actors and a real
hit with audiences. The
theatre echoed with the
gasps of awed patrons
as the curtain fell and
that itself should speak
volumes of the skill of
both Jamie Lloyd’s di-
rection of the shows and,
of course, Harold Pinter
himself.
Folk tales of an anti-facist working-class hero
W
hilst living
in Scotland
I learnt that
there are
few better ways to spend
a cold Tuesday night than
in one of the many folk
bars dotted throughout the
country. Here, in the warm
atmosphere of ale and
brown wood, musicians
walk in and out, playing
freely, supping from their
pints, waxing lyrics and
giving life to tales both old
and new. Last Saturday
night, I couldn’t help but
reminisce these jovial
nights as the Young’uns
presented, sang, and
recalled The Ballad of
Johnny Longstaff. This is
a tale in the most honest
meaning of the word, one
of oral tradition, the kind
passed from generation
to generation, kept as an
heirloom to be repeated
in pubs across the land.
Teeside Folk extraordi-
naires the Young’uns keep
true to this tradition, de-
spite the formality of the
Southbank Centre stage.
Using little more than
their voices, interview
fragments, and the occa-
sional instrument, they
give life to the show’s
star: Johnny Longstaff.
Longstaff’s story,
which the Young’uns
themselves heard from
Longstaff’s son at a show,
is one that deserves to
stand the test of time
and be recollected again
and again. A young man
walking from Stockon-on-
Tees to London in desper-
ation of something to eat
and somewhere to work,
Longstaff soon found
himself in the middle of
the unionised workers of
the time. This is becomes
the background for the
show’s central focus,
that of Longstaff fighting
against Franco during the
civil war between the re-
publicans and nationalists
of Spain. It is a show that
is remarkable in many
ways. The first being
the sheer variety of en-
thralling British interwar
history that is recollected,
all with Longstaff at the
centre.
Upon your return home
from the show you’ll find
yourself on your laptop
looking up the Battle of
Cable Street, Oswald
Mosley, Hunger marches
and “How can I learn to
sing like the Young’uns?”.
For here, recollection is
not just spoken word, but
also ballads, chants and a
hilarious ditty or two. The
talent of the singing trio
that form the Young’uns
can’t be understated.
Whether it be acappella
or with musical backing,
their stunningly crisp
voices echo and give
warmth to Longstaff’s
story. In between songs or
narration, the stage centre
lights up for Longstaff to
give fragmental accounts
of his past. These, along
with the occasional pro-
jected photo, help ground
thesinginginrealitywhich
ironically leaves one in a
further state of disbelief as
the story unfolds. Moving
moments are plenty here,
so tissues for tears (both
of joy and sadness) will
be needed. Longstaff, his
friends, and the estimated
thirty thousand volun-
teers who fought against
fascism in the Interna-
tional Brigades need their
story to be spoken – here
the Young’uns have truly
done it justice. My only
regret being I wasn’t able
to hear the tale in the
warmth of an Edinburgh
bar.
