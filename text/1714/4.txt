an opportunity to ask the
guests questions. Topics
of discussion ranged from
student entrepreneurship
and the student experience
at Imperial to the increas-
ing cost of international
tuition fees and Imperial's
recognition on a global
scale.
Speaking to Felix after
his visit, Sir Michael
Barber said:
"I’ve really loved
meeting the students here.
I’m very inspired by the
students I’ve just met.
You see the energy, the

grateful to everybody
here who enabled me to
come visit."

membership Tate card and
through free subscription
to Blyth Drawing evening
classes.
Mindy Lee, Head ofArt
at the Blyth Centre, said:
“We know there are
a lot of talented artists
throughout Imperial who
are studying science. I
wanted to further enhance
our creative support and
reach out to provide a
more formal and sustained
provision of 1:1 mentor-
ing and access to a regular
drawing class for excep-
tionally talented students.
The cost of art materials

be provided, to allow the
artist to explore free from
financial restraints.”

“The Fellowship has
been written based on fel-
lowships for professional
artists and in response
to student feedback. It
is an incredibly exciting
opportunity. It will enrich
a student’s knowledge.
I cannot wait to receive
the applications and
look forwards to seeing
what everyone has been
making. As a professional
artist I would LOVE to do
this Fellowship myself!”

Heavenly bodies:
Imperial’s annual
Charity Fashion Show
hailed stellar success
Helen Money-Kyrle
Arts Editor
O
n the evening
of Friday 8th
F e b r u a r y ,
the Union
Concert Hall was filled
with a lively audience
for the greatly antici-
pated annual Imperial
College Charity Fashion
Show: Luna, Terra, Sol.
Sponsored by Godiva
and organised by the
Fashion and Design
Society in collaboration
with ICU RAG, the
event brought together
models, dancers, sing-
ers, designers and an
enthusiastic audience in
a whirlwind evening of
entertainment.
First on was Polish
designer Karol Cygan’s
collection, his bold and
futuristic designs setting a
modern and exciting tone
for the show. Next up was
the latest Appareal collec-
tion, designed by Olesya
Nazarova, with sleek and
mysterious moon-grey
outfits, tailored for the
21st
century woman. The
brand prioritises sustain-
ability, using recycled
fabrics and crafting the
collection in solar-pow-
ered factories. After a
quick change, our models
were back wearing An
Original Leroy, designed
by Natasha Wright, in
bold and unapologetic
neon prints, paired with
strangely charming
Escape the Cloud laser-cut
jewellery by Imperial
student designer Olivia
Gallupova.
After a vibrant perfor-
mance from Imperial’s
Belly Dancing Society,
the second act kicked off
with the Ardill Larosi
contemporary menswear
collection, followed by
Kashida’s outerwear
collection, pairing earthy
coloured jackets with
simply embroidered
scarves. Student-led
movement SolidariTee
finished the Terra segment
of the show, whose shirts
raise support for refu-
gees and whose profits
go towards legal aid in
Greece.
Onto the final section
of the show; fashion guru
Nuno Lopes De Olivieria
flies in from Macau for
his second collection at
Imperial College Charity
Fashion Show. Inspired
by the gas giant Jupiter,
where it rains diamonds,
the models glittered their
way down the catwalk in
Nuno’s latest collection.
Featured in British and
Italian Vogue, designer
Nuno told Felix that his
current work is partly
inspired by the increas-
ing popularity of online
make-up tutorials, with
colours inspired by
eyeshadows. The event
closed with lingerie,
notably the Made by Ava
collection, of which each
item was handmade.
Not only did the event
celebrate fashion and
design, but all profits will
support three deserving
charities, namely The El
Salvador Project, The Na-
tionalAutisticSocietyand,
finally, Doctors without
Borders, where efforts
are being focussed on
the current humanitarian
crisis in Yemen. The show
closed with some moving
thank you’s from organ-
isers Marianne Gazet and
Izabella Higson, who
extended their thanks
to all who contributed,
from the make-up artists
and photographers, to the
models who spent hours
rehearsing and to the
DramSoc team behind
the scenes. A sleek and
sparkly event for a good
cause, this year’s Fashion
Show was certainly a
memorable occasion.

Imperial hospitals face £650m repair bill

ThreewestLondonhos-
pitals run by the Imperial
College Healthcare NHS
Trust are the most urgently
in need of repair in the
country. Charing Cross
(which is the hospital
with the highest urgent
repair bill of £312m) in
Hammersmith, St. Mary’s
in Paddington and Ham-
mersmith Hospital are
facing total costs of about
£650m for high-risk and
significant-risk repairs.
Speaking to The Sunday
Times, a spokesperson
for the Imperial College
Healthcare NHS Trust
responded: “Our staff are
still managing to provide
very advanced care in
buildings that are simply
not fit for purpose.”
In September 2018,
problems with the lifts

which is facing the second
highest repair bill of
£229m and is the hospital
at which the Duchess
of Cambridge had her
three children, affected
its maternity services and
forced women hoping to
give birth at the hospital
to make alternative ar-
rangements.
This revelation comes
following an investigation
by The Sunday Times
into the 102% increase
over the last three years
in the total sum needed
to eradicate the NHS
maintenance backlog
of “high-risk” and “sig-
nificant-risk” problems.
This figure now stands at

Urgent repair bills
include high and sig-
nificant risk issues.
Significant risk repairs
are those that “require
priority management” and
“risk healthcare delivery
or safety”. The NHS
defines high-risk repairs
as those that “must be
addressed with urgent
priority in order to prevent
catastrophic failure, major
disruption to clinical
services or deficiencies
in safety liable to cause
serious injury and/or pros-
ecution.
