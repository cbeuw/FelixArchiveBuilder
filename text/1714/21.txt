A
love letter
written to fans
in gory detail,
Resident Evil
2 remake makes the
otherwise grim situation a
brilliant beauty to behold.
Taking the original game
which was released in
1998 on the PS1, RE2
remake polishes it up
for the modern era,
with all new content,
better camera angles and
graphics that highlight
the gory goodness that
is Zombies tearing into
people like they’re candy
floss. Straying very little
from the source material,
the game gives you
the true Resident Evil
experience of terror, fun
and intense inventory
management! So, allow
me to be your guide in this
not-so-wholesome tour of
Raccoon City!
Taking place in said
Raccoon City, your
standard run-of-the-mill
small city is situated in
midwestern US. Despite
going by the surprisingly
nice name of Raccoon city,
it isn’t quite what you’d
expect, as our unfortu-
nate protagonists Claire
Redfield and Leon S.
Kennedy find themselves
not enjoying their visit
in what is apparently a
zombie-infested hellhole.
What could possibly bring
them to the city? Well,
Claire is searching for her
brother, Chris, whilst Leon
is enjoying his first day on
duty as a Police Officer
(which is a well-deserved
FML situation).
Upon arriving, they
find that things may not be
going as well as expected,
with zombie-filled streets
and abandoned fiery
vehicles littered every-
where. Wandering around
the city trying to find out
what happened, our two
protagonists attempt to
investigate the city and try
to make it out alive. The
plot thickens more and
more as details emerge
about a pharmaceutical

company being responsi-
ble for the crisis that has
befallen Racoon City. Un-
fortunately, said company
is inclined to not leave any
survivors to tell the tale,
leading to an additional
dash of gasoline being
added to the dumpster fire
that is Raccoon city; in the
form of BOWs (Bio-or-
ganic weapons) and other
terrifying man-made
monstrosities.
Overall, the story is
quite simplistic…on
surface that is, but, just
like the story and its
location upon digging
deeper, it has a lot more
going on than one would
expect, with a tonne of
details relating to other
games and a plethora of
themes and subplots in-
cluding romance, betrayal
and corruption. RE2 is
a real mixed cocktail of
emotions.Thestorystrings
you along and provides
background information
through the player finding
dossiers, documents and
computer files throughout
the game. This leads to a
fantastic feeling of im-
mersion and pacing as by
the end you find all your
questions answered (for
the most part, you still
need to complete all the
campaigns to fully satiate
your Scooby Doo mystery
solving needs). You heard
me correctly, there are
multiple campaigns in-
cluding Claire A, B, Leon
A, B, Hunk’s campaign
and the legendary Tofu
run, with the last being a
gag campaign. Now you
may be wondering what
all this A and B nonsense
is, and I can tell you it’s
something that makes the
game all the better, with A
and B denoting different
campaigns where char-
acters take an alternative
path to the original; B
is only unlocked after
completing A and also
includes its own secret
boss.
Now onto gameplay,
featuring Resident Evil
4 style gameplay but
with considerably better
graphics, the game plays
exceptionally well. But
be warned, if you’re new
to the Resident Evil series
and are expecting some
form of hack-n-slash
shoot ‘em up, you are
poorly mistaken. A staple
feature of RE2 remake
is that ammunition is
scarce and you don’t have
a full armoury of six or
more weapons; gradually
throughout the game
you will upgrade your
weapons and every so
often acquire a new one (a
maximum of 4-5 weapons
per campaign). Just acting
as General Hindsight yet
again: don’t expect to
pop a cap in every single
zombie you see, some-
times it’s simply better to
walk past or dodge them.
This is because, unlike
the classic action horror
stereotype, it requires
multiple shots to the head
to take down a standard
zombie. Putting aside the
details of the action genre,
the horror element of the
game really comes into

play when running low
on ammo or dealing with
enemies that you’re not
necessarily well equipped
for, i.e. a massive trench-
coat-and-matching-hat-
wearing brick shit-house
combined with Arnold
Schwarzenegger’s Mr
Freeze, minus the puns.
The game is a remake
after all, so how does it
vary from the original
you might ask? Honestly
speaking, there are quite
a lot of variations from
the original, for example
Lieutenant Marvin
Branagh actively helps
the player as opposed to
being dead the moment
you walk into the police
station, along with a lot
of other details that I
cannot mention due to
my desire not to spoil the
game too much (you can’t
get me for the Lieutenant
Marvin spoiler, that was
in the demo!). But overall
certain scenes play out
somewhat differently
from the original, with
one minor boss fight being
a welcoming variation
from the original. Also,
for all you arachnophobes
out there they’ve taken
the giant spiders out of
the remake, so the game
just may be palatable for
you now, if you get past
all the gore and footstep
inducing panic. It may not
have spiders included but
for those wanting to inten-
sify their feeling of nos-
talgia, Capcom currently
has DLC that allows for
the original game’s music
to play instead of the re-
mastered soundtrack. The
remastered soundtrack,
by the way, is fantasti-
cally well done and also
includes some touching
new additions.
Overall, Resident Evil
2 remake has my seal of
approval, ditching the
typical bad camera angles
that plague the early
games, RE2 really shines
as a perfect example of
how to remake a game
and then just make it that
much better. The only
fault that I could possibly
have with the game is that
there isn’t more, however,
this may be sufficed with
the upcoming DLC that
Capcom is adding for free!
And if that isn’t enough for
you, mods and costumes
are available on steam to
customize your experi-
ence even more *cough*
having DMX play every
time Mr X appears *end
cough*. So happy hunting
for ammo as you have
‘DMX- X Gon’ Give It To
Ya’ playing as Mr Freeze
chases you.
