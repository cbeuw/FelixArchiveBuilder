T
he Roehampton
University Cup
attracts the best
university teams
in the country, each of
them competing for the
prize of a year’s mem-
bership at Roehampton
and their names on the
prestigious trophy.
Imperial’s 1st team,
who were also defending
champions, had a tough
draw during the group
stage with local London
rivals and many’s pick for
the title this year, LSE.
Meanwhile, Imperial’s
2nd team would attempt
to forge their way to the
final on the other side of
the draw in the hope of
setting up an all-Imperial
clash.
The group stages took
place on Saturday, with
Imperial 1st opening their
campaign with a closely
fought 3-2 win over LSE,
but there were worrying
signs. String 1 and PSA
pro, Seigo “top shot knot”
Masuda suffered a defeat
at the hands of Singapore
number 5 and fellow
PSA pro Chua Man Chin
in a closely contested
match. IC’s Patrick “The
Tree Chopper” Brandl
succumbed in a closely
fought match at string 3.
So while Dave “nudeman”
Newman, Pam “the merci-
less” Hathway and James
“The Hound” McCouat
serenely swept their op-
ponents aside, IC squash
knew that, were they to
meet LSE again in the
knockout stages, victory
was far from certain.
Imperial 2nd also had
their share of success.
Their campaign involved
no shortage of drama
with team captain, Tom
“Yorkshire” Readshaw
suffering from a serious
case of gender-neutral
flu. However, this only
spurred the team on, with
third string Cam “it’s a
roller” Morrison securing
some especially crucial
victories for their spot in
the knockout stages.
Saturday evening was
spent fraternising with the
enemy over a Roehamp-
ton home cooked lasagne
and a special treat for the
dessert: a Q&A session
with world number 6 and
Commonwealth silver
medallist, Sarah-Jane
“The Markswoman”
Perry. It was truly inspir-
ing to hear from a profes-
sional athlete with similar
academic background
to many of IC squash
students (S-J completed
an engineering degree
before turning pro).
Sunday began with both
IC teams competing in the
quarter-finals. The 1sts
against a strong Durham
team and the 2nds against
last year’s semi finalists
Leicester. Leicester
proved too strong for
the 2nds this time round.
But a quarterfinal finish
alongside other 1st teams
certainly shows that IC
Squash has strength in
depth to be proud of.
As for the 1sts, they
brushed Durham aside
with a resounding 5-0
victory. Revenge was then
swiftly enacted on Leices-
ter in the semi-finals with
another convincing 5-0
win. Then came time for
the Final everyone had
been talking about, not
least the LSE team who
were overheard in the
dressing room plotting our
downfall – they had sussed
us out. They thought Seigo
stood no chance against
the “dragon slayer” from
Singapore, “The Tree
Chopper” had been felled
once and would be again.
James, Pam and Dave had
got lucky in the first round,
and now the mighty LSE
would expose our one-di-
mensional games…
Well, Dave, Pam
and Seigo were up first.
Inspired by S-J the
evening before, Dave
and Pam hit their targets
with poise and precision,
imposing themselves
without even dropping a
single game. Seigo, re-
covering from his earlier
loss, deployed a tactical
masterclass. The slaying
of the slayer ensured the
title was once again in IC
Squash hands. Two strings
remained – dead rubbers?
No chance. Enter “The
Tree Chopper” and “The
Hound” to ensure there
was no silver lining for
the LSE. A 5-0 emphatic
championship victory!
All credit to LSE for their
fighting spirit and they
will certainly be back
next year to challenge us
again for the title. In the
meantime though… IC
squash is on fire!
