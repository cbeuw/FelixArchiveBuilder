The trial of Union
Breakfast has come
to an end, just five
months after its
launch

Union announced
its decision to
cancel its breakfast
offering following sub-
stantial financial losses.
From Monday 18th
Feb-
ruary, Union Breakfast
will cease to be served
and the opening hours in
FiveSixEight will revert
to 12pm. The decision was
taken a week ago, with the
breakfast offering being
described as causing the
Union to “absolutely
haemorrhage money”.
Speaking to Felix, Rob
Tomkies, Union President,
said: “There was an initial
spike in the performance
of sales and so on, which
is obviously really good,
but actually it then started
to peter out. Towards
the end, we’d get about
£16-17netaday,andthat’s
without staffing costs or
anything, which equates
to four meals a day. At
which point, the decision
was made that it wasn’t
financially viable. If you
have one staff member
on, they’re earning £8-9
an hour, they’re there for
five hours – you’re minus
£20 a day. If we carried it
on, it’s predicted to cost
us £8000, just because of
staffing costs outweighing
the food performance.”
Claudia Caravello,
Deputy President (Fi-
nancial Services), was
allegedly not consulted
prior to the decision
being made, highlighting
a possible disconnect
between members of
the Senior Management
Group (SMG) and the
student-elected Officer
Trustees. One member of
staff commented, “largely
it’s been Julia and SMG
taking things on”.
In an e-mail informing
Union staff of the decision
to end Union Breakfast,
Julia Mattingley, Head
of Commercial Services,
stated: “I am extremely
proud of the effort, cre-
ativity and willingness
of our amazing Bars &
Catering team to take on a
new project at the busiest
time in our year and
without full resources.
You’ve worked hard and
it hasn’t gone unnoticed.”
Union Breakfast was
announced in response to
the the widely unpopular
decision to scrap breakfast
in the Senior Common
Room (SCR) at the start
of the 2017-18 academic
year. Felix was provided
with a joint statement by
Julia Mattingley and Rob
Tomkies:
“The breakfast project
came about as a result
of the five year Com-
mercial Strategy and a
steer towards extending
and improving our food
offer generally across the
Commercial Services, to
include bar food, func-
tions catering and retail
grab ‘n’ go. The work first
started on the early stages
of the breakfast project in
April 2018 with a view
to launching during the
Welcome period. We were
always clear that this was
a trial – as this was not
something we had tried
before – and there were
several unknowns at
launch mainly due to the
timing of the launch and
several operational chal-
lenges that we were (and
still are) experiencing at
the time. We got amazing
feedback from our mem-
bership which we will
factor into all of our future
plans going forward. We
have taken the decision
to cease breakfast service
for the time being in order
to lay firm foundations.
These foundations will
set us up for the future
and ensure the long term
viability of our outlets in
order to better serve our
membership.”
After the disastrous
performance of Union
Breakfast during its trial,
stakeholders, such as stu-
dents and Union staff have
raised the question of why
the trial was launched in
the first place without firm
foundations already being
in place.
According to Rob,
competition with the
breakfast offering in the
Library Café was a sub-
stantial obstacle: “One of
the main factors we strug-
gled with is the Library
Café do run breakfast,
it’s a very similar offering
to our own and, overall
Campus Services put
in £1m subsidy a year.
Which means they can
go down to costs that we
literally just can’t match.”
This comes as the
latest development in the
ongoing efforts being
made to improve the cater-
ing offerings on campus.
Rob informed Felix that,
“Claudia has been putting
a lot of work into the food
offering on campus with
Campus Services because
they have a considerably
bigger budget than us,
they can do all sorts of
things.”
Despite the failure of
this short-lived breakfast
trial, students are being
reassured that this does
not mark the end for
breakfast offerings on
campus. Reflecting on
this, Rob added: “We are
very much still looking
into reviewing breakfast
but, at this point, we need
to actually look at all the
information we got, the
customer feedback, the
performance reports and
so on. Actually try and
figure out why is it that
we’re only making £17 a
day. Why is it only four
people are having food
here each day? When it
comes round to next budg-
eting, look at what the
lessons learnt are because
students do need food but
clearly what we’re doing
at the moment isn’t what
they want”.
