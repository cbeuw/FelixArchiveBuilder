The Bhangra Showdown 2019
CLUBS & SOCIETIES

Taking place on 2nd
March 2019, The Bhangra Showdown (TBS), an interuniversity Bhangra competition, is back for its 12th
edition. This time, it
returns to the prestigious Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith.
What is The Bhangra
and exciting TBS to date.
We have one of the best
teams this year and are
super excited to bring
TBS back home to the
Apollo”
Anisha Malli, a 2nd
year medical student, also
from the committee, said,
“Despite how stressful
running a show of this
size has been for its main
organisers, it is definitely
worth it because TBS is
amazing to watch and
we get to raise money for
some incredible charities.
What drew me to PSoc
was its inclusivity and
how the whole society felt
like an extension of my
family. I’d never been part
of anything related to my
culture whilst at school
so it was exciting to learn
more about being Punjab
at university.”
Whilst The Bhangra
Showdown is now world
renowned, these Imperial
students over the last
decade have worked to
make it a success story.
This was considered
unexpected in the words
Jessica Gar-Lai Cheung leads Team Loughborough //
Punjab2000
of Hardeep Dhanjal,
founder of The Bhangra
Showdown – an imperial
student back in 2007!
“It started as an idea
between good friends,
with a view to repli-
cating the successes of
well-known shows in the
US and Canada, which
were gaining traction on
YouTube at the time.
We were fortunate that
the Millennium Dome
had just been purchased
by O2 and so an amazing
venue was available for a
Shinda and The PropheC.
Expect to hear the famous
‘Mundian Toh Bach Ke’,
which is the synonymous
Bhangra song you hear at
every night out!
University teams com-
peting include Aston Uni-
versity, Brunel University,
Hertfordshire University,
Imperial College London,
Kings College London,
Leicester University,
Loughborough Universi-
ty, St. George’s and Royal
Holloway University. All
of the teams will be co-ed,
which usually consists
of eight male and eight
female dancers.
Who organises The
relatively good price and
we managed to convince
the student union that
Bhangra would be the
next best thing after Brit-
ain’s Got Talent!
Unfortunately, up until
the night before the show,
we had only confirmed
250 tickets, leaving most
of us disappointed.
However, we were
then pleasantly surprised
to hear that the phone
hadn’t stopped ringing
all morning on the final
day, pushing our debut
Showdown?
T
he Bhangra
Showdown has
been organised
by Imperial
College Punjabi Society
since 2007. Various
universities across the
country, with students
from different courses and
years, train for months
to compete in front of an
audience of 3000.
Previously, it has taken
place in both Birmingham
and in London, in venues
such as Wembley Arena,
NIA Birmingham and
Resorts World Arena.
The high production
stage set up, quality of
teams and high profile
Punjabi artists are reasons
why students, families
and Bhangra lovers look
forward to this competi-
tion every year. Moreover,
the funds for this event go
towards charitable causes.
Following the compe-
tition, some of the teams’
Youtube videos have
crossed over 100,000
views, making it a globally
followed competition.
Anisha Malli said,
“TBSisthebiggeststudent
run show in the UK, so
its size alone does give
it a different atmosphere
to other Imperial shows.
Also, it is entertainment
not just for students, but
also for families. The
show attracts people from
so many different back-
grounds and is enjoyable
for all.”
What can we expect
from this year’s com-
petition?
Nothing less than a
night of entertainment
should be expected. This
includes a star studded
line up of Punjabi artists
and the most elite uni-
versity Bhangra teams
competing.
Bhangra is a colourful
and vibrant dance form
originating from the
Indian subcontinent. Over
the last few decades, it has
attracted undeniable pop-
ularity worldwide with its
high energy performanc-
es, fluid movement and
formations, and music
that will want to make you
dance!
Artists include high
profile names in Bhangra
music, such as Punjabi
MC, Raxstar, Surinder
numbers to 1000!This was
the beginning of Bhangra
in the modern era for the
UK and the competition
space has now expanded
significantly beyond our
wildest imagination.”
The Imperial Team
Imperial College also
has its own Bhangra team,
which has competed
every year at The Bhangra
Showdown. It has gener-
ally been quite successful
– winning the competition
three times and placing in
most. However, one of the
most special things about
the Imperial team is how
inclusive the team is to
new dancers and giving
them this opportunity.
Dancers from the team tell
us more:
Maya Satheeskaran, a
1st
year medical student
from Southside hall said,
“one of my mates took me
to a free bhangra session.
Even though I was bad at
it, I went to more sessions
as I really enjoyed it and
going to more helped me
improve. Then, luckily, I
was selected when audi-
tions came around.
I think it’s nice for the
team to change every year
so that new people can
meet each other. I look up
at the older dancers as I’m
starting up on the bhangra
journey, but I hope that I
continue it in future years
potentially.”
Annanya Menon, a 3rd
year medical student said,
“Previously it has taken place in both Birmingham and in London, in venues such as Wembey Arena, NIA Birming-
ham and Resorts Wrold Arena” //Punjab2000
Bhangra Showdown?
Our very own Imperial
Punjabi society, a small
committee of less than
a dozen, organises this
competition year on year.
Aman Ghataura, a 4th
year Physics student, from
the committee, said: “The
Punjabi Society has been
working round the clock
to bring the most modern “The next best thing after Britain’s Got Talent!” // Pun-
jab2000
“over the years I have
come to appreciate the
different styles of dance,
even the difference in
technique within a dance
form. Bhangra has been
more about technique and
fitness.
Having danced a lot
at university, Bhangra
was a different dance
form I wanted to try to
push myself. It is a very
different process and
experience and provides a
physical challenge. I have
enjoyed picking up new
technique over the last
few weeks and bettering
my skills as a dancer with
the use of various props
as well as enjoying the
variation in dance style
within Bhangra.”
“What drew me to PSoc was its inclusivity” // Punjab2000
Many of the dancers
have done multiple
shows during their time
at Imperial. For example,
Maya is also currently
choreographing for East
Meets West and Annanya
was captain of Imperial’s
winning Just Bollywood
team. However, it is clear
that, for these dancers,
there is something
unique about TBS that
makes months of difficult
training so worthwhile.
Lakshi Selva, a 5th
year medical student and
captain of the team this
year said, “Bhangra has
taught me a lot about time
management and being
efficient. Bhangra makes
a good break from 5th
year medicine which can
otherwise be quite monot-
onous and repetitive. The
challenge of The Bhangra
Showdown keeps me
on my feet and gives me
something new to look
forward to everyday.”
