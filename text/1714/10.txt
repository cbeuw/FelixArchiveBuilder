Although Cardi B’s in-
fectious party tune ‘I Like
It’ and Sheck Wes’ ubiq-
uitous white boy mosh
pit anthem, ‘Mo Bamba’
were both solid tunes,
this category came down
to two standout smash
hits - Drake’s ‘God’s Plan’
and the Drake-assisted
Travis Scott number
one, ‘SICKO MODE’.
Deciding between these
two got pretty heated
but in the end, since the
Grammys awarded Drake
with Best Rap Song
‘God’s Plan’ and it’s
still fuck the Grammys
all day, the committee
decided to award Young

marked Travis’ Gradua-
tion moment - when his
music transcends hip-hop
and receives mainstream
recognition. However, for
all the stellar curation that
Travis offers, what this
album lacks in bars will
always prevent it from
taking home Album of the
Year. Invasion of Privacy
represented an impressive
debut and her Best Rap
Album victory at the
Grammys represents the
latest fascinating devel-
opment in her remarkable
career. However, much
like ASTROWORLD,
what the album lacks
in bars and pure lyrical,
“It was written like
Nas but it came from
Quentin”
“I did half a Xan, 13
hours ‘til I land
Had me out like a
light”

This year has been a
stellar year for singles in
the UK, with the seeming-
ly ancient art of crafting
an album being almost
wholly abandoned by the
scene in lieu of infectious
drill and afro swing
“And I know right now
that we’re not talkin’
I hope you know this
dick is still an option”
“Baby, bend ya’ back
and then dig it”
“Girl, why can’t you
wait ‘til I fall out of
love?”

‘Call Out My Name’
represented an anthem
marking the return of
The Weeknd that we have
been missing. Who knew
all it needed was for Abel
to have his heart broken

stand too close
You gon’ fuck around
and drown off this wave”

6LACK
This was the most hot-
ly-contested category and
proved the most difficult
for us to reach a decision.
To be honest, the winner
of this category changes
depending on mood.
A$AP and Tyler
together create magic.
We’ve seen it time and
time again, they truly are
a dream team and ‘Potato
Salad’ is the latest proof
of that. Let’s hope the
rumoured collab album
provs to be true.
Jay Rock and Kendrick
Lamar effortlessly swap
bars on ‘Wow Frestly’ and
their chemistry is evident
from start to finish.
Ofthiscategory,‘OTW’
could be described as the
only truly collaborative
effort since it is the only
track with more than two
“On God, it’s off the
head, this improv but it’s
no comedy
Sign I fail? Hell nah
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)”

|Drake - ‘Look Alive’
[Blocboy JB] | Joyner
Lucas - ‘Lucky You’
[Kamikaze, Eminem],
2 Chainz - ‘X’ [Black
Panther, Various Artists]
This was by far the
easiest category to decide.
If it weren’t for Jay-Z
dropping one of the
best and most important
verses of his career, trap
newcomer Don Toliver
(who has been described
“Wah-wah-wah, bitch
I’m Lil Baby”
Nominations | Gunna
| Blocboy JB | Sheck Wes
Blocboy JB and Sheck
Wes both burst onto the
scene with smash hits but
their lack of sustained
success through a debut
project (Blocboy JB is
yet to drop his debut and
nobody was trying to hear
Sheck Wes’ Mudboy)
meant it would be difficult
to justify them winning
this category.
Therefore, this category
ultimately came down
to frequent collaborators
Gunna and Lil Baby. It
feels weird to have the two
compete, especially when
they work so much better
together. Although Gunna
had a stellar year fea-
“Tay Keith, f*** these
n****s up”
Nominations | Kanye
West | Metro Boomin |
Wheezy | Boi1da | Murda
Beatz
Although Boi1da,
Murda Beatz and Wheezy
held it down with solid
production this year, there
were three clear front-
runners in this category
- Metro Boomin, Kanye
West and Tay Keith.
Having had a stranglehold
over the NeighbourHOOD
Grammys Producer of the
Year award since its incep-
tion four years ago, this
year saw Metro Boomin’s
dominance start to wane.
In a quiet year for Young
Metro, he still managed
to deliver a solid, nomi-
nation-worthy album in
November’s NOT ALL
HEROES WEAR CAPES,
which was enough to keep
his name in the conversa-
tion. If we’re keeping it
100, Kanye West deserves
to win this category for
the immense feat of pro-
ducing five albums this
summer. However, it’s
still fuck Donald Trump
all day (word to YG) and
Tay Keith is a worthy
winner after fucking these
n****s up all year.
Nominations | East
Atlanta Love Letter,
6LACK | Lost & Found,
MODE’ is a Drake and
Travis-infused banger of
epic proportions. Drake
comes through with a
new flow, fresh out of the
OVO sweatshop. The use
of distorted organs serves
to give the track an eerie
feel and the beat change
adds to the track’s unique
flavour. Travis Scott
serves as the orchestrator
behind this track, bringing
Drake and Swae Lee in
with perfect timing.
Honourable Shoutouts
| ‘Mob Ties’, Drake
‘Mob Ties’ is Drake’s
love letter to the cruddy
lifestyle he wishes to
embrace. He tried it with
‘Headlines’ and failed
but, with ‘Mob Ties’, he
has succeeded in adding a
lavish touch to a lifestyle
that few would under-
stand.
rapping ability prevents
it from taking home the
HOOD Grammy.
Book of Ryan is an
autobiographical mas-
terpiece. The album is
by no means perfect but
Royce makes up for the
shortcomings by weaving
an introspective story of
his life into every song.
With Daytona, Pusha
T delivers a collection
of timeless luxury raps,
living up to the album’s
name. It’s does what
all the other albums in
the 7-track G.O.O.D.
Music roll out failed to
do - making you want
to re-up the album like
your local Pusha re-ups
on the pack. Production
on the album has been
crafted with the precision
and brilliance we’ve seen
from Kanye in the past.
Here it’s displayed in a
continuous uniform state
of one sample-based
instrumental after the
other. This, with Pusha’s
lyricism on the topic of the
inner-workings and trib-
ulations of drug dealing
represent the essence of
hip-hop, spanning from
the Big Daddy Kane’s
to the Jay-Z’s. Despite
its brevity, Daytona is a
worthy winner of Album
of the Year
Honourable Shoutouts
| Swimming, Mac Miller |
Nasir, Nas
Swimming represented
the latest development
in Mac Miller’s musical
journey of maturing,
which we had been fol-
lowing with each albums.
It is a cruel shame that this
journey was cut short by
his tragic, untimely death.
R.I.P. Mac.
Nasir is a testament
to Nas’ longevity within
as as Trap Michael
Jackson, would have
swept this category with
his unique and almost
disrespectfully hard verse
on Travis Scott’s ‘CAN’T
SAY’. When someone is
giving you a look with a
guest spot on their album,
you are not meant to come
this hard. Especially if you
are relativeley unknown.
Don Toliver doesn’t care.
Drake had arguably the
best feature run in 2018
and this was launched by
his verse on Blocboy JB’s
‘Look Alive’ at the top of
the year. Drake did what
Drake does - he floated on
the beat and stole the song
for himself, whilst simul-
taneously putting Blocboy
JB on and catapulting the
song into the top five.
This has become a tried-
and-tested formula almost
as old as time itself and it
shows no signs of failing
any time soon.
J. Cole ran features in
2018, seemingly running
a campaign to jump on
every rapper’s tune and
murder every beat. This is
unprecedented behaviour
from rap’s resident recluse
but, after a lukewarm
reception to his K.O.D.
album, this was an easy
way for him to remain
relevant and keep his
name in the conversation.
Any number of J. Cole
features could have been
selected for this nomina-
tion but, in the end, it went
to his verse on J.I.D.’s
project. J. Cole impressed
by keeping pace with the
rapid spitter J.I.D. and
dropping one of the bars
of the year -“y’all n****s
homonyms, sounding the
same”. Mind blown.
Jay-Z’s verse provides
an insight into the concept
of freedom, viewed from
multiple perspectives,
whether it be from a
historical viewpoint of the
Black American struggle,
or a look at the current
plight of the Black com-
munity. However, he adds
a personal aspect to it as
he journeys from these
perspectives to how it
personally affects him, his
family and his friends. He
the rap game. Although
he has been rapping for
a considerable amount
of time, he is still able to
deliver a solid project.
The lyrics are deep and
meaningful, resonating
with the audience as he
delivers his message.
Jorja Smith | Isolation,
Kali Uchis
Kali Uchis’ Isolation is
a certified bop, however
its pop-leaning sound
meant it was difficult to
categorise as R&B and
even more difficult to
justify as R&B Album of
the Year.
Jorja Smith’s Lost &
Found is another excellent
debut and would probably
take home Debut Album
of the Year, if not for
Cardi B.
This category ultimate-
ly came down to 6LACK
and The Weeknd and,
despite The Weeknd’s
offering only being an EP,
the committee had to go
with the lightskin sensei
supreme, Abel.
My Dear Melancholy,
is The Weeknd in one
of his rawest and most
exposed forms to date.
We see Abel’s growth, not
only as an artist, but as a
person as he transitions
from making music about
partying, drugs etc. to
having an EP solely ded-
icated to dealing with his
feelings of heartbreak. It’s
a bittersweet moment to
see ones sensei go through
such feelings of turmoil,
however it gives us an
opportunity to view The
Weeknd through a differ-
ent lens, one that allows us
to see his compassion and
vulnerability, whilst also
dissecting the negative
aspects of how he deals
with such emotion.
Honourable Shout-
outs | K.T.S.E., Teyana
Taylor | Suncity., Khalid
| November, SiR | Lady
Lady, Masego
SiR’s November is
another smooth offering
from TDE’s resident male
R&B afficianado.
It is a real shame that
Teyana Taylor let Kanye
West get his hands on her
album because we suspect
her vision for the project
was far greater and her
creativity was stifled by
G.O.O.D. Music’s strict
seven-track regime.
Masego’s Lady Lady
is by far the smoothest
listen of the year and, if
it weren’t for its neo-soul/
jazzy instrumentation
taking it out of the con-
versation for R&B Album
of the Year, it would easily
have swept up an award.
tunes. Headie One led the
drill charge with ‘Know
Better’.
Dave & Fredo had a
massive achievement
with their ‘Funky Friday’
banger, which made it to
number one.
This category ulti-
mately came down to a
decision between Ambush
Buzzworl’s ‘Jumpy
(Remix) and Unknown
T. Although the award
almost went to Ambush
for his hypnotic “sweet
one” ad-lib, Unknown
T emerged victorious.
‘Homerton B’ is the only
drill tune that you’re
allowed to catch a whine
to at carnival and it not be
weird.
Honourable Shout-
outs | ‘Boasy’, Avelino |
‘Money Right’, Dizzee

‘Dancing Man’, J Hus
Free J Hus. J Hus needs
to be free so that Summer
can officially begin - the
sun won’t shine until the
Bouff Daddy is free
for him to really enter his
bag and give us the music
that we deserve from him?
It might sound selfish, but
we’re really hoping Gigi
Hadid breaks his heart so
he can give us a classic
R&B album for the ages.
contributors. The three
R&B crooners join forces
to craft some magic here.
Ultimately, the awar
had to go to Gunna and Lil
Baby. The dynamic duo
and direct descendants of
Young Thug join forces
almost as well as Gohan
and Trunks following the
fusion dance in Dragon-
ball Z to create one of the
year’s most infectious trap
bangers. The two have
seemingly learnt from the
mistakes of Future and
Young Thug before them
and have made sure to
join forces at the start of
their careers, as their buzz
is about to enter its most
feverish hype. This union
can only serve to improve
their respective careers.

tures-wise, the award has
to go to Lil Baby, by virtue
of the fact he dropped
