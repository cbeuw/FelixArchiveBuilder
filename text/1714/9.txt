eyes to the full beauty of Ben Howard’s latest album
and powerful, is followed
by ‘Boat To An Island On
The Wall’, a seven-minute
odyssey which gradu-
ally builds, ending in a
distorted guitar solo that
provides an appreciated
moment of heaviness in
the track list.
‘What The Moon
Does’ is another highlight
(although almost every
song is a highlight), and
maintains the intensity
that the previous song
established with a driving
and propulsive guitar lead.
Lyrically, Ben reflects on
the purpose of his music,
and also demonstrates his
newfound affinity for a
simple life: “Feed the dog
/ Walk a mile / Most things
now / Make me smile”,
may seem saccharine and
reductive when read here,
but is delivered with such
sincerity that it becomes
heart-warming.
The interlude track
‘All Down The Mines’
provides a 47 second
breather after the again
propulsive and dance-
able ‘Someone In The
Doorway’, but also
serves another purpose: to
make the sudden, heavy
and noisy sound of the
following track, ‘The
Defeat’, even more arrest-
ing and powerful. Here,
a distorted saxophone
provides the backbone
for a compelling and un-
settling track that stands
out in the list, providing
paranoia and unease that
contrasts well with the
sincere and honest tone of
the previous songs.
Following this inten-
sity is another moment
of quiet, ‘A Boat To An
Island Pt. 2 / Agatha’s
Song’, which is the only
track that the album could
have done without. The
ambient drone is pretty,
but at just shy of 5 minutes
it overstays its welcome,
with a barely existent
structure that makes the
song vague and nebulous.
The final song, ‘Mur-
murations’, mirrors the
first track by creating
extreme beauty through
dissonance, but this
time the effect is even
more powerful. The
verses are incredibly odd
and unsettling, with an
evil-sounding drone and
unsure, nervous singing.
The verses evoke intense
feelings of unease,
and, like ‘Nice Libres’,
the choruses provide
a contrast so gorgeous
they feel transcendent,
redemptive. Each chorus
is short-lived, plunging
the listener back into
darkness, before a final
chorus brings you to
the surface for good,
with extra layers of lush
instrumentation and
drums. Again, charming
lyrics display Ben’s ap-
preciation for plainness
and simplicity, sung in a
triumphant and jubilant
tone. “Missed the end of
the world / And that was
just fine / Saw my family
for the holidays / And
we had a good time” is
beautiful in its directness
and understatement, and
(again) the sincerity with
which they are sung.
This album is poetic,
restrained, gorgeous, and
moving. It is incredibly
admirable that, instead of
following the hit-making,
platinum-selling formula
apparent on Every
Kingdom for producing
radio-friendly ballads,
Ben has developed a
sound that reflects artistry
and honesty, a sound
which is more difficult,
less direct, but strikes
those who persevere with
its unique, subtle beauty.

Noonday Dream revisited: How one gig opened my
Released back in June 2018, Ben Howard’s Noonday
Dream was drastically unlike any of his previous works,
dividing fans and critics alike. Initially panned by many
(music writer Alex Large included) for its sombre and
desolate tones , the album is a slow burner that has to
be experienced live to be fully appreciated.
“Powerful
lyrics which
are at times
abstract and
poetic, at times
direct and
profound, but
always sung
with charming
restraint”
B
en Howard has
had an interest-
ing change in
sound through-
out his releases. His debut,
Every Kingdom, was full
of uplifting indie-folk
songs with sing-along
choruses and a (generally)
carefree tone. His next
release, The Burgh Island
EP, marked a change in
mood hinted at by the
cover art; these songs
were darker, but the shift
from naiveté to moodi-
ness made the music more
compelling; optimistic
melodies and lyrics were
replaced with moments
of soul-bearing emotional
potency which were far
more exciting in their
honesty and vulnerability.
His sophomore album,
I Forget Where We Were,
continued to eschew the
light-hearted ballads that
brought him fame, and
again featured album art
to broadcast this intention.
The majority of the songs
were dark and complex,
yet kept accessible by
clear and well-crafted
song structures and Ben’s
passionate, emotional
delivery.
It was evident, there-
fore, that Ben had disa-
vowed the upbeat tone
of Every Kingdom that
had brought him fame,
and his biggest hits. The
first trajectory of Ben’s
sound was from youthful
innocence to a more
mature, sombre tone, and
Noonday Dream demon-
strates a second shift:
from extreme approacha-
bility, to a heavier sound
made compelling by raw
displays of emotion, and
finally to a style that is far
more reserved, less atten-
tion grabbing, and more
difficult to appreciate on a
first listen.
and desolate music that
was still transparently
emotive and direct, with
clear melodies and song
structures that could be
parsed without requiring
much focused attention.
I shelved the album,
thinking he had lost his
passionate spark and gone
oddly tame.
However, after
attending a live show
this January, the music
clicked. These live perfor-
mances were just as subtle
and understated as their
album counterparts, but
the act of being present
in the same room as the
performer and his band,
with full attention paid
to the music, made their
oblique beauty come to
life. And the fact that Ben
chose to play these songs
almost exclusively struck
me as brave, considering
the marked difference in
tone between them and
the songs most of the
crowd no doubt wished
to hear. It was admirable
that Ben stuck to his guns
and didn’t play a single
sing-along hit that he must
now see as childish, and
demonstrates great faith
in the new material.
With a newfound appre-
ciation for both the music
and Ben’s artistry, I revis-
ited the album, and found
a veritable treasure trove
of beauty. The simple,
catchy choruses of Every
Kingdom are gone, and so
too are the dark, torment-
ed screams of passion
that provided many of
the most potent moments
from his previous album.
In their place are powerful
lyrics which are at times
abstract and poetic, at
times direct and profound,
but always sung with
charming restraint. The
instrumentals are softer,
denser and more interest-
ing than previous albums,
with less reliance placed
on a finger-picked guitar,
and still contain moments
of intensity that lend the
album a good sense of
pacing and variety.
The primary theme
of this Noonday Dream,
evidenced both in the
newly restrained sound
and Ben’s lyrics, is an
appreciation for the little
things, for a quiet, modest
life, more reminiscent of
a well-travelled poet than
a celebrity. The album art
and promotional music
video mirror this inten-
tion; on the cover, Ben
blends in with his sur-
roundings, barely visible,
less an attention-seeking
performer than a piece of
the environment. In the
music video for ‘Nica
Libres At Dusk’, Ben
is present, but his face
is never visible. This
rejection of fame was also
apparent during the live
show, where the spotlight
was trained on Ben from
behind, transforming him
into an elusive silhouette.
A number of lyrics
reflect Ben’s newfound
interest in simplicity and
peace, enjoyment of the
present, and an appre-
ciation of nature. Like
many profound things,
these lyrics can seem
simplistic and banal when
read or stated plainly, but
paired with the evocative
music and Ben’s sincere
delivery, they often strike
you as both aspirational
and inspiring. From the
opening track, ‘Nica
Libres at Dusk’, the lyrics
“Now I am older / I don’t
look over my shoulder
/ I know what is there in
front of me” provide the
emotional climax of the
song, and demonstrate
Ben’s newfound maturity
and contentment with
living in the present.
This opening track is
fantastic because of the
lyrics, but also because of
the intense sonic disparity
between verse and chorus.
As the album opener, the
verses are surprisingly
unsettling, with an unre-
lenting guitar loop that
refuses to shift, and the
first line “Door is locked
/ My gums are bleeding”,
combining to create a dis-
orientating, uneasy mood.
However, this uncomfort-
able sound transforms
with the chorus, becoming
blissful and euphoric,
and the preceding unease
contributes greatly to
the newfound feeling of
salvation and safety.
After this comes
‘Towing the Line’, a quiet
and understated song con-
sisting primarily of Ben’s
vocals, a muted guitar, and
subtle vocoder backing
vocals. This track, which
is somehow both delicate
