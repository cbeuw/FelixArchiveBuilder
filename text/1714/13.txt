Nerone and Poppea - Falling for the Villains
This Valentines Day, Arts Writer Maria Portela reflects on one of opera’s great romances... how can we love the
unlovable?

L
iterature, movies
and plays are
all filled with
couples that we
love to love. Be it with
“happily ever after” fairy
tales or tragic romances,
we, as an audience, tend
to be in favour of those
characters who live their
stories for the pursuit of
love. We gladden when
they meet, find our-
selves wishing for their
happiness, weep when
tragedy pulls them apart,
and excuse their flaws
or poor choices with the
righteousness of their mo-
tives. On the other hand,
anyone who opposes our
favourite fictional couples
and threatens them being
together is vicious and
deserves punishment.
There is an underlying
assumption that someone
who is capable of love
must a good person and,
conversely, that the bad
guys don’t get to love
and should suffer eternal
loneliness instead.
The protagonists of
Monteverdi’s opera L’in-
coronazione di Poppea
seemingly defy all these
conceptions. Both histori-
cal figures, Nerone (Italian
for Nero) and Poppea are
all but virtuous.
He was a Roman
Emperor, known for
matricide, extravagance
and tyranny, chief suspect
of the Great Fire that in
64 AD destroyed half of
Rome, and the first serious
persecutor of the new-
ly-born Christian faith.
She was an ambitious
noblewoman, known for
marrying her way to the
title of Roman Empress
and plotting the murder
of everyone who opposed
her along the way. Hardly
your typical boy meets
girl story…
During the course of the
opera,whichliberallycon-
denses historical events
from several years into a
single day, we accompany
the machinations that lead
to Poppea’s ascension
to the throne. These
include adultery, political
intrigue, treachery, forced
suicide, disguise, divorce
and the exile of Nerone
and Poppea’s respective
wedded partners. Of
course, because we’re
talking of Baroque Opera,
one or two mythological
gods must make their
appearance. Eventually,
Poppea is crowned
empress while divine
choruses of Cupids
and Graces dub her the
goddess of beauty on
earth, and Roman Consuls
and Tribunes praise her
sovereignty over “this
happy empire”.
The opera ends with
its most iconic musical
number, a delicate duet
where Nerone and Poppea
pledge eternal love (see
right).
This piece is often
performed in concert
halls, where it is easily
regarded simply as a
beautiful love song. But
when we analyse it within
the broader context of
the opera, our collective
“audience morality”
becomes at stake. Because
we have just seen (for
the past two hours!) how
terrible those people two
are, and yet, their song
somehow captivates us.
We hate their tyrannic
habits and we know from
History that they turned
out to be even crueller
than the opera portrays
them. Roman historians
claim that real life Nerone
kicked a pregnant Poppea
to death, a mere three
years after marrying her:
how’s that for true love!?
But yet, in those brief
moments, we pick their
side and secretly wish for
villains!
The truth is no one can
resist a good love story,
even if it is a wicked one.
As L’Incoronazione di
Poppea proves, this can
be achieved by a trick as
simple as changing the
lens through which the
story is told. By focusing
on evil characters, this
opera makes them more
relatable and thus more
deserving of experiencing
every facet of human life.
As we learn their
motives, we tend to read
their deeds at a more
favourable light. No, we
don’t forgive them. But
we might concede that
everyone should have
a chance to love and to
be loved, no matter how
reprehensible their actions
are. Maybe Monteverdi is
right, and the world does
act on Love’s commands...
