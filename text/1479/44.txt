On Sunday 16th January, Imperial Wol-
verines took seven eager dodgeballers to
a village in Essex to challenge for glory.
Some members of the team needed some
convincing to make the journey but Tom
Peake, at his second official tournament
with the Wolverines, soon made it very
clear why it would be a fruitful trip. “Es-
sex? Isn’t that where all the sluts live?”
Dodgeball: Wolverines
edge up league table
Brilliant.
After catching the train, haggling with
some very desperate cab drivers, and
waiting around for a while because of
delays, we finally got underway at 1pm.
IC Wolverines were placed in a tough
group with Bedford Bulls A, the even-
tual winners, and a team we had crossed
swords with in Southampton earlier in
the season, Minotaur Dodgeball.
The way tournament matches work
is that you have five two-minute games
and the team to have won the most out
of those five, wins the match.
The first match of the day was against
the Minotaurs and it proved a feisty af-
fair! Their captain, ‘Moore’, is well
known for being a bit of a complainer,
but on Sunday he took “throwing one’s
toy out of one’s pram” to another level,
turning the entire crowd against him.
The unfit, untrained and turkey stuffed
IC girls rocked up to Ethos on Monday
night with much foreboding, the unmis-
takable sense of apprehension and anxi-
ety could only mean one thing. Medics.
This year’s match was made even more
personal due to Becky’s unfortunate liv-
ing arrangements with the medic captain.
The team’s strategy was simple, win
and win well. IC got off to a great start
over turning the first Medic centre and
scoring the first two goals. In the mean-
time, captain Lucie was eager to sever
any prior medic relations ensuring the
opposition captain crumbled to floor in
her wake. However, from here things
started to go a bit pear shaped and our
lack of training became evident towards
the end of the first quarter with IC nar-
rowly leading 8 – 6 when the whistle
blew.
Things picked up in the second quarter
and there was excellent movement in the

IC goal third between shooters Angela
and Heather, however the medics had
some good set plays in the centre third
and IC were unable to extend their lead,
the score at the end of the first half was
15 – 13.
After a rousing team talk at half time
the IC girls returned to the court feeling
revitalised, it was a fantastic quarter and
there was brilliant defensive play from
Fern and Nakai, intercepting many balls
in the medic’s goal third. The IC girls
finally looked like they were on form,
there were some exceptional shots from
goal shooter Lucinda and great passing
around the goal third by centre Sarah
and wing attack Lucie. IC were able to
score twice as many goals as the medics,
increasing the lead at the end of the third
quarter to 25 – 18.
In the last quarter the medics rallied
together for a final attack but it wasn’t
enough to worry the IC girls and the fi-
nal score was 32 – 24.
Despite some untidy play it was a
good first game back for the third team
and a promising start to the term.
