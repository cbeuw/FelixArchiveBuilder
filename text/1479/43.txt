Rugby: 1st XV record
stylish victory
The fifteen recorded a well-deserved vic-
tory and impressive victory over RUMS
in their first match back after Christmas.
The disruption caused by the inclement
weather towards the end of the Christ-
mas term meant that this was the first
game that the 1st XV were playing for
nearly two months. This however, did
not stop the team out classing their op-
ponents who showed no signs of ever
winning the match.
It has been leaked that following the
festive break the squad met in order to
discuss how should build upon the per-
formances of last term. Various reports
suggest that the team are changing
their training and the buzz word around
the squad at the moment appears to be
‘standards’ with coaches Brimah Kebbie
and Richard Birkett introducing painful
fitness exercises in order to trim down
some of ‘the fat club’.
Imperial arrived at the ground well
ahead of schedule and were warming
up by the time their opposition stepped
off the bus. Imperial took the initia-
tive from the off with RUMS unable
to handle the Imperial’s attacks. Impe-
rial broke the deadlock through fly half
James Hayward who cut through some
poor defence with Max Joachim adding
the extras before stroking home a pen-
alty. Imperial’s forwards were dominant
in the set piece although they were put
under pressure at the base of the scrum
with number 8 and stand in skipper
Charlie Esberger and scrum half Olly
Cox constantly being scragged. Despite
this the forwards turned over RUMS
ball at the put in on more than one oc-
casion. Added to this the lineout, which
has in the past proved to be an Achilles
heel for Imperial worked well and Im-
perial were awarded a penalty try after
RUMS persistently collapsed the Impe-
rial’s driving mauls off the lineout.
Imperial were reduced to 14 men just
before half time with the referee judg-
ing Thomas Chavas’ tackle to be illegal.
Imperial went into half time sitting on a
comfortable lead but knew that the first
ten minutes of the second hald would be
keen. On too many occasions this season
they have let teams back into the game
after switching off at half time. Coupled
to which Imperial were a man down.
Imperial didn’t take a backward step
and continued to dominate their opposi-
tion pack despite Chavas’ absence. The
endeavor of the team was rewarded with
another try, courtesy of Ed Labinki at
the back of another driving maul. Labin-
ski is currently scoring at will and could
even end up Imperial’s top scorer at the
end of the season, a prize which a certain
Chris McGeough would be desperate to
achieve judging by his touchline hug-
ging appearances which have become
common although were strangely absent
yesterday.
Whilst Imperial’s forwards managed
to subdue their opposite numbers with
prop Simon Fenton winning the Man of
the Match award, Olly Cox was often
caught at the breakdown and was unable
to provide quick ball as a result. Some
suggest that Cox may have let himself
go over Christmas and is a member
of the aforementioned ‘fat club’. His
weight increase may have contributed
to his lethargy at distributing the ball to
Hayward.
Joe Harris and George ‘95 kilos’ Lane
combined well in the centre putting in
some good tackles but were not given
too much of an opportunity to run. Louie
Barnett showed attacking promise cut-
ting through the RUMS defencive line
and looked very quick on occasions.
Nathan Fitzpatrick rounded off the scor-
ing for Imperial by grabbing the fourth
try of the match. Fitzpatrick surprised
everyone, including himself, by finding
the try line. Toby Spittle played well in
the front row until Angus Tenison-Col-
lins replaced him due to a dodgy shoul-
der. David Wilson looked to enhance
his reputation as being ‘the new Alex
Johnstone’ but his lineout throwing was
perhaps too accurate for this comparison
to hold true, despite Wilson maintaining
fantastic chat throughout.
Ollie Benton provided an able re-
placement for Fitzpatrick and celebrated
the win by tucking into chicken drum-
sticks claiming to be on a new diet that
is sweeping the rugby club by storm.
Pierre L’Bour made his first appearance
for the 1st team late in the game as Keb-
bie used one of his now famous late tac-
tical substitutions.
The victory was a mature performance
from a team, which has not hit top gear
yet this season. The attitude of the team
was epitomised by the Imperial for-
wards turning over the RUMS scrum in
the last play of the game.
The team left feeling extremely satis-
fied with their performance and a some
of the players took to the social network-
ing site Twitter to display their pleasure
at the result.
