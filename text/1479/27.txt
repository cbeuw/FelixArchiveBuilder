December brought Wooden Shjips to
the Relentless Garage. Wooden Shjips
are a Space/Drone/Psychadelic rock
band hailing from San Francisco. This
was my second time seeing the band, the
first having been at Green Man in 2009.
The band has an intelligent, spacey,
zoned feel, but it’s not for everyone.
Perhaps the most immediately recog-
nisable aspect of this gig was the facial
hair. Solid efforts were made from all
bands, but Erik “Ripley” Johnson of
Wooden Shjips and Moon Duo brought
this aspect of the night’s entertainment to
a stunning climax, sporting a beard that
would make Getafix the Druid proud.
Dusty Jermier on the Wooden Shjips’
bass followed a similar line, modelling
pigtails and a moustache reminiscent of
Obelix.
Wooden Shjips were supported by
Moon Duo and Howlin Rain, a band
new to me, who played powerful guitar
driven rock evocative of a 70s Lynyrd
Skynyrd (but beards more of the Iron &
Wine school). Aquick search on Spotify
for their name is well worth the effort.
The evening was appreciated by
a crowd consisting of a surprisingly
eclectic age range. Towards the end of
the night, a small group of men danc-
ing as though nobody was looking
was seen to nucleate at the front of the
venue, although the activation energy
wasn’t reached for most not to remain
content to bob their heads to the atmo-
It turns out that the BRMC have been
turning out their brand of stripped-down
garage rock, more reminiscent of the
New York scene than that of their native
California, for a decade now. They’re
one of those bands that you’ll probably
know a lot of songs by, but you won’t
know the name of – they’ve written a
lot of the three-chord, XFM-friendly
music that you never bothered to find
out about. Still, they aren’t a bad night’s
entertainment – the band, at the end of
a long tour, put on a decent show and
rattled through their back catalogue at
machine-gun speed, complete with a
pleasing (if incongruous) laser show.
‘Rock & Roll’ is dead
Suffering from a lack-spirited fearlessness, contoversy and attitude,
the withering genre of ‘Rock and Roll’ music is feared to be losing
its roots and nearing its end
Reach for the lasers, man.
If anything, though, the speed was part
of the problem. They can clearly play
and play well, but their self-consciously
minimalist style means they don’t seem
to want to, substituting playing simple
riffs at a million miles an hour for doing
anything more complex or involving. It
also meant that they cleared their set-list
in a breathless sixty minutes before mov-
ing onto a forty-five minute encore, a
crime more befitting Axl Rose’s bloated
and monstrous ego than a self-professed
no-bullshit rock band. Still, the bizarrely
middle-aged crowd lapped it up, and
even attempted one of the world’s slow-
est and most optimistic mosh-pits as the
set reached its climax. All in all, a show
for the dedicated fan only, but if you can
check them out at a festival, where the
short stage times might better suit their
style, they’d be worth a look.
‘Rock & Roll’
– It’s time to
toughen up!
spheric drones and pulsating bass line
of Wooden Shjips songs like We ask
you to ride and Aquarian Time. The
drones were embellished with catchy
guitar riffs and the neatly placed key-
board work of Nash Whalen. The high-
light of the act for me however was the
energetic drum beat that accompanied
song after song.
It would feel slightly wrong not to
give a full picture of the gig, and it must
be admitted that listening to drone rock
for this kind of a period can give rise to
quite a significant headache. It is not
as though Wooden Shjips mindlessly
bludgeon your head as one might with
a pneumatic drill or similar blunt instru-
ment, but cranial penetration is self-
evidently achieved. Probably the best
analogy is that of trepanning, since the
drilling is accompanied with significant
surgical skill and for some people may
reach straight to their demons.

A
s electronic music surg-
es through the cables
that are the circulatory
systems of London’s
nightclubs, some mu-
sical styles have taken steps towards
infiltrating this electronic dominance
in today’s music scene, notably con-
tempory R&B/Hip-Hop and Pop. Other
musical styles have taken the front-
line in a competitive battle against it,
for example, Folk or Indie, and they
are fighting a good fight. My beef is
with the Rockers - a dangerous group
of people to be starting a fight with I
hear you say - well, you would think so
wouldn’t you. The truth is that there are
people out there flying the flag for Rock
music who would jump at the sight of
a Harley-Davidson, hold their tounge
when insulted and cringe at the thought
of wearing leather. Yes, there are metal
heads, but a musical movement that
changed the world can’t have amount-
ed to that - no offense. Just like how in
Pop and R&B sex sells; in Rock music
vulnerability, tears and acoustic guitars
seems to be doing the same. Now we
have so-called ‘Rock-stars’ wailing
about their broken hearts, whimpering
of lost ways and how comfortable love
is... This is not ‘Rock and Roll’! The
potential to rock is there, just let the
guitar do the wailing, the mods do the
crying, get proactive and man-the-fuck-
up ‘Rock and Roll’!
