The w0rld Expla1ned by
Dunc-E, the clumsily-
programmed and seriously
misinformed robot
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict arised be-
cause 0f the jews and the arabs didn’t
kn0w where anything is. The Jews are
all like where is Israel? And the Arabs
are like d0n’t kn0w where Israel is 0r
s0mething because they say that Israel
isn’t there and then the jews get Angry
and then the Palestinians are all like get
kicked 0ut 0f Palestine because they
are actually in Israel but the Arabs d0n’t
reck0n it is Israel and but the Palestin-
ians are als0 Arabs but n0t all Arabs are
Palestinians and s0 n0-0ne really kn0ws
what Palestine is and wh0 is a Arab or
a Palestinian and s0 the jews just kick
every0ne 0ut 0f Israel but actually it’s
n0t even Israel 0r s0mething s0 they all
just start sh00ting each 0ther because
it’s easier s0luti0n t0 a very c0nfusing
situati0n.
This week Dunc-E
explains...
The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
Pass the sick bag:
The thing that surprised me the most
about the Daily Mail article was the
veracity of the report, but then the pho-
tos did only contained white students.
It amused me when they talked about
Rugby players eating doughnuts of each
other’s dicks as if it were an unusual
spectacle. If they’d only spoken to me,
I would have told them that it’s actually
rarer to see an Imperial rugby player
without another one eating something
off his dick. Here is how I would write
an article for a general evening of lout-
ishness at the Union.
It’s a rowdy Wednesday night at Im-
perial College London and things are
kicking off! After speaking to an excit-
ed, and clearly inebriated, fresher who
said ‘This is shit, I’m going home’, it
was obvious that this was a night not to
be missed.
I walk into the main drinks bar place
called Five Seven One? Seven Eight
Six? Oh it’s Five Six Eight because
that’s how many millimetres make up
a pint! Hilarious! The witty name alone
gave me some indication of just how
funny some of the students at Impe-
rial College London are. For instance,
one rather large oafish topless football
player compared my drinking of wine to
the habits of a homosexual male, which
of course had me in stitches of laughter.
I then stared in amazement as the
whole football team managed to each
imbibe a whole pint of alcoholic bev-
erage by continu- ously gulping
until the whole glass was
empty. The abil- ity to drink
fast is appar- ently rec-
ognised in the sporting
community as a feat
of endurance, despite the fact that noth-
ing is really enduring anything because
drinking is a natural human function. I
guess the liver has to process the toxins,
but if it were all about liver endurance,
surely they would simply take turns to
inject pure alcohol into their veins and
see who can live the longest. I have to
admit that I would be more impressed if
they were downing pints of bleach.
I then walk outside and find an alter-
nate reality to the world of Nine Three
Eight. Instead of loud, unintelligible and
discordant songs about downing pints
and sucking dicks, I found a crowd of
babbling intellectual high-functioning
smokers. I sat down and asked one for
his name, to which he replied, ‘what
does my name mean to you? A name is
just a name; it’s doing something with
your name that gives it meaning.’ And
then he took a drag from his cigarette and
breathed out with deliberate slowness,
as if giving me ample time to digest his
twatty attempt at philosophical proverb.
I go into the Union nightclub sort of
thing called Metric, WHICH IS FUNNY
BECAUSE WE’RE FROM IMPERIAL
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-
HA. It would seem that the overwhelm-
ing male majority were trying to so-
licit coitus from the small population
of visually displeasing girls. It’s always
the same visually displeasing girls who
go to Metric, so I’m assuming that the
rugby/football team have some sort of
rota system for determining who gets to
take them home. The stench of sweat,
ego and visually displeasing girls is
enough to make me vomit. Thankfully a
Christian Volunteer group were standing
by with a bucket, but I chose the floor
because I’m Indie and non-conformist.
Any passer-by could question the true
calibre of Imperial’s finest minds, but
then most of Imperial’s finest minds are
in their rooms wanking over Schrod-
inger. And I can’t be too critical of the
sporting teams because that is a damn
good rota-system they’ve got going.
Hangman needs
new writers. If
you think you’re
funny, you’re
probably not.
If you don’t think
you’re funny and
just sit in your
room crying and
masturbating,
you’re probably
perfect, so give
me an email:
