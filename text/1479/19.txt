COMMENT
F
or a long time, I’ve tried to
live life in the fast lane –
even occasionally overtak-
ing on the central reservation
– but it’s only recently that
I’ve come to realise why.
Even when I was young, my parents
would complain that I had ants in my
pants. Apart from a rather unfortunate
picnic, that wasn’t literally true, but I
always had to keep moving. In college,
out of college, even when I’m home, I
just don’t feel right unless I’m doing
something. As a consequence, I have an
embarrassingly clean room. The really
lurid secret is that I intentionally make
a mess of it just so I can tidy up again.
At first, I thought I had been drugged.
I feared someone had swapped my Can-
derel tablets for ProPlus pills. It was
only after I added them to my double
expresso, and my heart didn’t explode
that I realised that I was safe. I didn’t
sleep for a week but at least I was alive.
Next, I considered that maybe it was
just a natural reaction. This world of
ours is chock–full of so many awesome
and amazing things and, given the finite
amount of time that I have, I can’t af-

ford to stop and smell the roses. I like
to procrastinate in reverse – why do to-
day what you could’ve done yesterday.
Even in my pitifully small corner of the
cosmos, there are so many interesting
things to see and do that it would be a
waste to let any of them slip by.
But that isn’t quite the whole of it.
There was one day last term where it
finally clicked. Here is how I remember
it. It starts at 7am with a morning full of
medical student stuff – taking histories,
drawing blood, avoiding Daily Mail re-
porters, then lunch with my girlfriend.
Back to campus where I plaster every-
thing that doesn’t move with posters for
an upcoming event, dipping in and out
of the library as I do so. Afterwards, I
go to the gym to pump my (negligible)
guns. I finally go home at 8pm, but still
no rest for the wicked – or me. I help my
house–mate prepare for a small group
presentation. When he goes to write up,
I ring home. Something of a mistake –
my Mum could talk the hind legs off 2.3
metric Blackpools of donkeys. At 11pm,
I finally sit down to dinner but my day
is still not over – I still have an article
to write for Felix and there is a rather
immediate deadline looming. I sit down,
do the research and write the piece until
2am.
Quite a full day by anyone’s measure.
I have enjoyed every minute but it’s fi-
nally time for sleep. I’m just about to
bed down with my nightcap and a glass
of warm milk when something ticks
over in my mind. It’s bin day tomorrow.
Wearily, I trudge downstairs and out into
the back garden to empty the bins.
And I stop.
It’s a clear night and the moon is full.
The air is still and it seems like the whole
world is quiet. The black bags and I are
bathed in moonlight and I am genuinely
awestruck by the serenity and stillness
of the moment. It’s beautiful.
This is why I run up escalators. This
is why I eat lunch standing up. This is
why I appear in photos as a vague Rhys–
shaped blur. It’s because in the constant
buzz, the triumphant brass band, of the
25 hour life, it is easy to forget that you
have the option to just…stop.
I highly recommend you try it some
time. Take five minutes out of your
busy schedules and enjoy a little slice of
tranquillity.
T
he television licensing
people and I are playing
a game. The rules of the
game are pretty simple. The
first player – that’s me –
abides by all known laws this side of the
Mars–Jupiter asteroid belt. The second
player – Grand Duke John Hales of the
London South West Enforcement Divi-
sion – simply has to send a letter to me
every month asking if I’ve broken any
laws yet. Simple game.
Mr. Hale’s opening gambit this week
was the TV Licensing equivalent of the
“When did you stop beating your wife?”
poser: a letter expressing a desire for
me to “have the information you may
need before a hearing is set at your lo-
cal court”. Is this a cheap way for Angry
Geek to boost his ratings, with a quick
legal battle to sell to the tabloids? Of
course it’s bloody not. I’m not going to
court, is why.
The letter is full of the most exquisite
wording, with all the subtlety of an el-
ephant–based strip parlour operating
underneath a nunnery. But not once does
it say that I’m going to court, of course.
It’s just a friendly factbook should that
happen, complete with info on what I
can take into court. If you’re wonder-
ing what these tips consist of, it’s things
like “You can take a lawyer in to court!”
Angry Geek
and “The chap in the funny wig is the
boss man!”, all bullet–pointed and read-
ing like hints from a video game load
screen. All it’s missing is a little stick-
man rendition of Deputy Chief Admiral
Of Pain John Hales, pointing towards
the words ‘court’ and ‘enforcement’ and
winking at the reader. Maybe a speech
bubble insinuating something about
‘accidents’.
I don’t watch television. I don’t watch
television because even if it wasn’t full
of utter shite these days, the rare mo-
ments of brilliance it does have are
usually on at times when I’m busy do-
ing other things – reading papers, spik-
ing the sushi in the JCR, writing Angry
Geek/Felix Hangman fanfiction – and
so I’m forced to watch it online later.
Why would that be a surprise these days
anyway, given that I’m connected to the
Internet? There are animated gifs of cats
sitting on robotic hoovers that are worth
more than ITV’s entire seasonal output.
Anyway, I’ve calmed down since
discovering that people far crazier than
I have been posting about John Hales
for over four years on internet message
boards, with the most sane posts being
entire drafts of legal writs filed against
him for defamation of character, and
the least sane debating whether or not
he really exists at all (complete with
signature comparisons for post– and
pre–2008, like a low-grade CSI set on
the District Line). The moment where
a man looks at these websites and won-
ders if they might have a point, as I did
only yesterday evening, is the moment
he takes a long hard look at himself
and realises this madness has gone far
enough. Look at it from John’s perspec-
tive. All day he’s signing these fricking
letters. He probably doesn’t even care.
And there are people out there debating
whether or not he even exists. That’s got
to get to you.
So I’ve torn up my hastily drafted
response along with the illustrative
ten–step guide to the rather obscene pro-
cesses the letter laid out in words, and
instead I’m going to write back to him
with a factbook of my own. I was think-
ing maybe a walkthrough to Pokemon
Gold and Silver, or a recipe for some
kickass Rocky Road I had made for me
at the weekend.
I’ll let you know how he replies. If
you’re reading this John, no hard feel-
ings. Here’s to next month’s thinly
veiled threat.
Do you definitely not want to not
not go to non-court? Don’t write in
immediately to...

Battersea is full of
chavs... and Imperial
College students
The importance of being idle
Has this College gone mad?
A block of PhD student flats
called Griffon Studios is being
built in the dodgy part of Bat-
tersea – an area saturated with
chavs. And apparently the land-
lord has the nerve to charge
£235/week for a room no big-
ger than a shipping container!
Imperial obviously doesn’t
have a clue. Griffon Studios is
a typical example of ineffective
decision making by the man-
agement of our university who
just don’t give understand that
students aren’t made of mon-
ey. The average PhD student
will earn £15,300/annum, so
at £235/week on rent they
are left with £3080 spending
money. No amount of waffle
can hide that plain fact.
Students find themselves in
a lot of financial trouble these
days. First, there was that awful
Clegg chap breaking his pledge
on tuition fees. Reminder to
politicians, if you hold up a big
bit of cardboard with a promise
on it, next to your signature on
it, people will notice when you
don’t keep that promise. Then
there was that dreadful creep
Osborne’s VAT rise. By the way,
did you know that sanitary tow-
els are subject to VAT? As if
sanitary towels aren’t a freak-
ing necessity!!!
So that’s the ridiculous world
that we live in. You would think
that we could escape such
madness within the confines of
our university, but sadly not. In-
stead of helping postgraduates
find affordable accommoda-
tion, we have Griffon Studios.
Why haven’t they created a
flat-sharing scheme instead?
Or built halls further outside
central London? Ah well, it is a
damned ‘business opportunity’
after all. I would urge you all to
not buy into it – even if you can
miraculously afford it – you will
be paying too much for the risk
of being stabbed nightly.
The College has guaranteed
that 97% of the rooms will be
occupied. Well, let them sell
the rooms to other universities
when they inevitably don’t meet
this guarantee with Imperial
students. I couldn’t wish any
better on those mongs from
UCL...
