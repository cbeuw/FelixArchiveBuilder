COMMENT
Britain’s off the rails
Perhaps it’s time to renationalise our railways and combat unacceptable service

n 1910,E.M.Forster described
trains as “our gates to the
glorious and the unknown.
Through them we pass out
into adventure and sunshine, to
them, alas! we return.”
He makes our railways seem
so romantic. There’s palpable
excitement in his words for getting
on a train and having a wonderful
adventure. Over a hundred years
have passed and our trains aren’t
going anywhere.
I’m writing this from just outside
East Croydon, stuck at a red signal,
while the conductor apologises for
the signal failure holding us up. I
live in Horsham, West Sussex. It’s
an hour south of London,and I take
the train to Victoria and the Tube to
South Kensington.
Studying for an MSc is an
expensive investment and financial
support is limited to career
development loans and non-
existent scholarships. Since I have
neither, I’m self-financing my MSc
from savings, part-time jobs, and
inheritance money. The only way
I’m able to make this work is by
living with my parents – I’d much
rather live in London.
Around half the trains I catch to
London with Southern Rail are late
or cancelled. According to Which?
surveys, Southern scored worst for
customer satisfaction and 39% of
passengers reported being late on
their most recent journey. It’s worth
mentioning that official statistics
only record ‘late’ as 10 minutes or
more.
Southern are full of excuses:
insufficient staff (maybe they’re
trying to catch the train to work),
emergency engineering works, lines
blocked by broken-down trains, and
even signalling failures – apparently
operating a series of lights defies
engineers’ best efforts.
There are legitimate reasons too.
Extreme weather (I’m not talking a
dusting of snow or leaves) such as
the flooding occurring in Cumbria,
and people who sadly take their
lives on the railway lines (this isn’t
as unusual as you might expect) are
unavoidable.
Most problems, however, are
down to incompetence of rail
companies themselves. I pay £28
every time I go to London (with
my one-third railcard discount). It’s
a lot of money to me and probably
one of the least enjoyable ways of
spending it. It’s hard to see where
my money goes when I’m crammed
into a carriage with thousands of
other miserable-looking commuters
on a broken-down train.
I’ve been late for lectures, missed
appointments for my Imperial
internship, and been late for social
functions, meetings and extra
curricular activities I’m involved
in – all due to incompetent rail
operators.
I’ve spent more than one night
at Gatwick Airport. Once, I cut
short a holiday in the west country
to attend a job interview. My First
Great Western train from Taunton
ended up stuck behind a slow
stopping service all the way to
London, I missed the last train to
Horsham (though I should have
arrived in plenty of time to catch
much earlier trains), and could only
get as far south as Gatwick.
I hung around the terminal
building all night attempting to get
some sleep before buying another
ticket, catching the first morning
train home to shower, change and
eat, then catching another train to
my job interview (ironically, at the
airport). I was exhausted and didn’t
get the job.
I’ve never received a refund.
because it’s a complicated pain, and
operators don’t issue refunds unless
the train is either cancelled or more
than 30 minutes late. I once applied
for a refund and was refused because
Southern said it wasn’t clear which
train I was trying to take, so they
couldn’t ascertain if I was telling
the truth. I’ve not bothered since,
though I must be owed hundreds of
pounds.
The cost to me and everyone else
who commutes is more than just
the ticket price. I spend £9000
on tuition fees, and I travel up to
London three or four times a week.
I worked out that I have roughly
7.5 hours of contact time with my
lecturers each week. A back-of-the-
envelope calculation suggests that
I am paying approximately 33p for
every minute of my education.
For every minute I am late, I am
wasting money. Thirty-three pence
may not sound like much, but over a
year, it adds up.
I contacted Southern with my
concerns, and have not been
dignified with a response. I’ve
tweeted them multiple times to no
avail. Their arrogance and lack of
consideration for the people who
pay their salaries (and substantial
bonuses) is astounding. They know
they can get away with operating
a shoddy service. While my rail
fares are expensive, they’re cheaper
than renting in London. The only
realistic way of getting to London is
the train, but there’s no competition
– we can’t boycott the train as we
might with other companies. We
have no option but to keep paying
extortionate sums of money for
substandard service.
I have several part-time jobs and
spent four years employed as a
teacher before coming to Imperial.
For most professions, punctuality
and organisation are essential. If we
don’t deliver our services on time,we
don’t get paid – simple as that.We’re
also likely to get sacked. When I
buy a train ticket, I should expect to
receive the service as advertised by
the timetables.
TheConservativeMPforHorsham,
Jeremy Quin, said this as part of
his Action on Railways campaign:
“There are thousands of people
[…] for whom a regular, reliable
rail service is absolutely critical.
Due to […] poor performance
by Southern and Network Rail,
rail users have not been receiving
the service they deserve or should
expect. Cancellations, timetable
changes, poor communication and
inadequate compensation have all
led to significant frustration.”
While the Government has frozen
fares, this doesn’t ‘compensate
for poor performance’. Rail
Minister Clare Perry is said to be
addressing these problems. I remain
unconvinced anything will change.
I’m still waiting outside East
Croydon, wishing I possessed E M
Forster’s optimism.
