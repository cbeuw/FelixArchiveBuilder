I
t’s almost that wonderful
time of year again. Everyone
goes home, remembers how
boring most their extended
family is, and starts panicking about
January exams. But it also means
New Year. And what is New Year, if
not an opportunity to make empty
promises that never stick about
getting in shape? While the second
week of January is the busiest week
of the year in the gym, 80% of new
members drop off by mid-February.
Well, for anyone counting calories
this January in a bid to get healthy,
researchers at West Virginia
University have some news that is
either good or bad – depending on
your biology. New research suggests
that most people’s blood sugar levels
rise and fall irrespective of what
they eat.After monitoring the blood
glucose levels of 800 people who
were on exactly the same diet, it was
found that levels varied dramatically
from person to person.Furthermore,
the blood sugar spike associated
with eating foods like cookies was
not observed at all in many test
subjects, whereas in others, even
eating ‘healthier’ foods like bananas
resulted in such spikes. Clay Marsh,
an epigenetic researcher at the
university, argues, “findings indicate
that blood sugar spikes after eating
depend on not only what you eat,
but how your system processes
that food.” And it turns out that
how your body processes food is
largely out of your control. Your
gut microbe mix, otherwise known
as the gut ‘microbiome’, is heavily
involved in digesting food, and has
been implicated in previous studies
to be integral to causing diabetes
and obesity.
So what can you do to eat
healthily? An earlier study showed
that personalized diets can help
control blood sugar levels. A group
at the Weizmann Institute in Israel
produced diets unique to each
person, but containing the same
number of calories and levels of
nutrients. For ten of the twelve

Bad diets?
The health police are turning in their graves as novel research suggests sugary foods
may not be all that bad for you
diets created by the nutritionists,
they were able to correctly predict
the blood sugar level response of
individuals, something that couldn’t
be done when all subjects ate the
same thing. So, in February, when
people like myself lie in bed eating
buttercream icing out the tube, we
can take solace in the fact that it
might not be as bad as we think.

t’s the 30th
November, and
the Paris Climate Change
Conferences commenced
only weeks after Isis’ attacks
on the city. Both events represent
momentous global issues plaguing
today’s society. Much debate has
arisen over their linkage. That
is, does climate change lead to
conflict? If so, will the resolution of
one help bring about a resolution to
the other?
As David Cameron streamlines
his efforts to ‘‘keep Britain safe’’ via
pursuing a campaign of bombing in
Syria, his lack of progress towards
meeting targets proposed by the
2008 Climate Change Act seems to
undermine his commitments. The
UK is the only G7 nation in the
process of increasing its investments
in fossil fuels. £1.7 billion has now
been spent financing oil extraction
in the North Sea, a venture
executed by George Osborne. In
addition, Cameron has shut down
developments of offshore wind
farms and plans for large scale
solar-power plants, concentrating
efforts towards natural gas while
discouraging competition in
carbon capture and storage. A
study published in Nature last
month indicated that with absence
of efforts to reduce the degree of
climate change, temperatures in
parts of the Middle East such as
Yemen and Iran will soon reach
levels uninhabitable for human
beings. It is certainly not a formula
for achieving world peace. But how
has climate change contributed so
far to Syria’s civil war?
Last month, the U.S. Secretary
of State said that ‘Primary to the
problem in Syria, the country has
succumbed to its worst drought
in record’. Reports from 2006 to
2011 document the migration of
1.5 million Syrian farmers to inner
cities, intensifying political unrest.
The droughts brought about failing
harvests, tripling food prices and
subsequently social strain.
However, climate change as a
causal factor for the conflicts in Syria
is subject to much controversy. For
one,estimates of relocation to urban
environments are provided from
a single media report. The Syrian
government and UN estimate that
there were only 250,000 migrants.
Migration seems to have occurred
overnight following the cancellation
of diesel and fertiliser subsidies,
with no evidence of any discontent
towards these migrants.
In my view, conflict analysis
should not be so black and white.
A multitude of complex interacting
relationships need to be considered
to inform efforts to reduce further
conflict risks. Suggesting climate
change as one contributing factor
towards Syria’s civil war is not
suggesting it as the sole cause. It’s
common sense that water shortages
caused by climate change threaten
the basic survival of Syrian citizens,
and thus trigger a deterioration of
the country’s economic health. Any
political and economic volatility
will aid exploitation of the Syrian
people by ISIS groups.
All this has been seen before. A
sudden escalation in the actions of
the terrorist group Boko Haram in
Nigeria came after years of severe
drought and the inability of the
government to deal with its effects.

million people has been implicated
in violence plaguing Northern
Mali. One meta-analysis looked
at 60 rigorous studies focusing on
criminology, economic, geographic,
archaeological, historical, political
science, and psychological factors,
and concluded that there was
a strong link between extreme
climates and conflict.
We live in a broken economic
system, whereby 85 families own
85% of global wealth, and 80% of
the world’s population own only
5% of global wealth. It is this 80%
majority, contributing the least
to climate change, that is most
vulnerabletoitsconsequences. So,to
return to David Cameron, how can
he commit so strongly to bombing
campaigns, while barely targeting
climate change? Regardless of the
answer, his policies will have little
effect until he starts addressing the
underlying causes of the Syrian
conflict.
