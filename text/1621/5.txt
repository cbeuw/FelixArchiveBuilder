All I want for Christmas is the truth
Not excited for Christmas? Maybe it’s because your parents lied to you

E
very year, a strange
phenomenon occurs:
trees are decorated, gifts
are exchanged, and the
world decides that it is again time
to deceive millions upon millions of
impressionable children.
Whenever someone discovers
that I’ve never believed in Santa,
the customary reaction is to lament
my poor, deprived childhood, which
must have been so dull without the
magic of Father Christmas.It is as if
I had revealed that my parents used
to give me a lump of coal, a slice of
bread and lock me away in my room
for the day. In fact, I was positively
spoiled at Christmas; I got to
spend time with my whole family,
make and eat delicious food, and
exchange gifts with people I love,
things which I used to get excited
for and still do, because none of
those things was pulled out from
under my feet when I discovered it
wasn’t real.
Few sentences inspire more
sorrow in me than “I don’t get
excited for Christmas any more.”
It is a sentence you hear from more
and more people growing up, and is
invariably, in my experience, said by
people who used to believe in Santa.
This is no coincidence – when most
of your excitement for a festive day
stems from your absolute belief that
a quaint old man with a beard will
miraculously appear in your home
and leave whatever you wish for
at the foot of your bed, it is little
wonder that when the illusion is
killed, so is most of your buzz.
On a more sinister level, the belief
(or lack thereof) in Santa creates a
weird power dynamic between older
and younger children, especially
siblings. Having never believed,
I can’t be sure, but I imagine that
most children don’t find the truth
in a “the talk”-esque chat with their
parents. It could be a school friend
who found out early accidentally
blurting out the harsh reality –
or worse, it could be deliberately
revealed in spite. Either way, it is an
embarrassing and awkward moment
which wouldn’t have to be endured
if people stopped lying to children
and let them enjoy the story of
Father Christmas for what it is – a
story.
These practical considerations
aside, the crux of the matter is
that children shouldn’t be lied to
unnecessarily. I don’t want my
children to grow up not trusting
what I say, and although leading
kids to believe that Santa is real
is seemingly innocuous, it is still a
lie. It still teaches them that their
parents don’t think it’s important to
tell them the truth.
Thatcherites of the world, unite!
Political diversity is to be
cherished, not shouted down as
“problematic”

L
ast week, FELIX Music
Editor, Cale Tilford,
complained that our
Union President, Lucinda
Sandon-Allum, had expressed
admiration for Margaret Thatcher.
He went as far as to say that her
comments were “problematic” and
displayed “…a complete lack of
empathy”.
Thatcher is not some fringe
character like Donald Trump or
Stalin; the British people elected
her three times in a row. It’s easy
to forget how low Britain had
sunk: reduced to working by
candlelight and three-day weeks by
cynical union leaders who held the
British economy hostage. We were
considered so weak that a third-rate
military junta in Buenos Aires dared
to invade sovereign British soil and
subjugate British citizens. Thatcher
defeated both through sheer force
of will, and the world took notice;
it was the Russians who christened
her the “Iron Lady”.
Thatcher took a sledgehammer to a
post-war consensus that had existed
for 25 years. Her legacy is divisive
but undoubtedly revolutionary. She
may have been an enemy of the
miners, but for the aspiring middle
classes who kept returning her to
Downing Street, she was something
of a saviour.To get there, she fought
her way to the top of the ultimate
Old Boys Club, flattening any poor
bastard who stood in her way. She
was Britain’s only ever female Prime
Minister and probably the most
powerful woman in our nation’s
history. Why shouldn’t she inspire
politically-minded women today?
Tilford later writes with regret:
“If a sabb at any other university
described Thatcher in the same
way there would be a wild uproar…
sometimes I wish I’d gone to UCL.”
That’s almost certainly true. A
new wave of small minded,left wing
intolerance has infected campuses
all across the UK and US.
At Yale, a professor who gently
questioned involving the university
to pass judgement on “offensive”
Halloween costumes was subjected
to the most horrible invective, and
has resigned from her position. At
Oxford, a debate on abortion was
cancelled, because both speakers
being male was considered
“problematic”. At UCL, the Union
saw fit to ban the Nietzsche club.
Only non-problematic philosophy
here, kids! On campuses all across
the country, pro-Israel students face
widespread hostility and disruption
from both other student groups and
their academics. Indeed, the NUS
(with whom we are thankfully no
longer affiliated) voted to boycott
Israel, yet failed to pass a motion
condemning ISIS.
When these groups seek to silence
or punish other opinions, they do
it by weaponising the language of
the victim. Assert that something
is “problematic” or demand a “safe-
space”,and there is no further debate
necessary, just skip straight to SU-
approved silencing or shaming.This
is a terrible trend, and will stunt the
intellectual development of a whole
generation of students.
We should appreciate the political
environment here at Imperial, a
rare oasis of sanity surrounded by
hysterical student activism where
students of all political persuasions
feel free to express their views, but
generally can’t be bothered because
they have too much work to be
getting on with.
