Jazz visions - Part I
Behind me Mingus
boogies, stops and shuffles,
over and over again.
Charles, if I gave you
three colours
could you draw
my portrait as well?
I cannot understand
where I am.
Music fills my sight.
Words gasp and pant
as they try to come out
and every step
they make
up the throat,
they slip back down.
What happens?
The music
turns into hundreds
of beating voices
that ask me things
I don’t want
or I don’t know.
Sound has become
an insisting hammer.
This noisy sky
is unbearably
obsessive percussive
pervasive obstructive.
A man with a hat
pops out and stands
right in front of me.
He says hi.
He stabs me.
I ask him
to be left alone,
but that just
cannot happen:
contractual obligation.
I repeat the same word
a thousand times
and everything disappears:
I am in front of my computer,
hands on the keyboard.
Why do I keep
writing poems￼
nobody can understand?

Y
ou lay your .44 Magnum on the tatami mat. Smith & Wesson, 6 ½”, cold blunt steel.
It cuts a lonely figure against the igusa straw, its barrel pregnant with the thick weight
of mortality. Six shots, six lives, six-winged seraphs, six points on the Star of David,
six degrees of separation.
You find a peculiar beauty in this moment, an amnesty from self-scrutiny, as your
mind wanders over the last seventeen years—as a felon might walk the plank—
stepwise towards the great plunge. Little pockets of sensation resurface: the tenderness of a mother’s touch,
falling sakura leaves, the gentle brush of lips. Almost as if your body were desperate to remember what life,
real life, feels like to touch, taste, smell, see.
You run an index finger along its spine and picture how it might all end. Imagine the gross burst of bones,
a shatter of flesh, a sea of molten red. Bleeding, bleeding, bleeding. Then, a final thud.
And you are death. Death becomes you.
Oh Takumi, if you only knew.
How much.
