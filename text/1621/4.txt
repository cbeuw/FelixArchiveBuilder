Pig’s head found in Australian university mosque
L
ast weekend, a student at
the University of Western
Australia discovered a
decapitated pig’s head in
the toilets adjacent the University’s
Muslim prayer rooms.
Majdi Fal, a Tunisian PhD
student, came across the gruesome
object when preparing for prayer
in the bathrooms near the prayer
rooms. He photographed the pig’s
head,which had been left face down
in the bowl of a squat toilet, and
posted it to Facebook, adding “If
this happened at a university, then
THINGS ARE ESCALATING”.
The post has since been removed.
Fal told ABC News that the fact
that it was a pig’s head wasn’t the
problem, saying,“it can be anything,
any other animal; it was the message
that was clear”.
“It was not the best start to the
day,” he said.
The University’s guild, an
organisation equivalent to our
student union, condemned the act,
calling it “damaging and offensive”
and“designed only to incite religious
and racial hatred”on their Facebook
page. Garnering over a thousand

Prasad and Dr Eric van Sebille
were definitely the highlights of the
Launch.Dr Prasad reflected on how
nature can be a invaluable source of
inspirationforscientistsandscience-
communicators, whilst Dr Sebille
made an impassioned case about the
need for clear and simple arguments
when communicating science to
general society. The buoyant crowd
of sixthformers, Imperialites and
sabbs then descended for the finest

likes, commenters on the guild’s
post pointed out that footpaths
through this part of the university
are fully accessible by the public,
and that it may not necessarily have
been the action of a student.
The leader of Western Australia’s
Muslim Youth group, Shameema
Kolia, described the difficulty of
being a Muslim after Islamist-
“It was not
the best
start to the
day,” the
student
said
motivated terror attacks, saying:
“We’re grieving for the loss of
human life, but before you can even
get through and process that, you’re
already expected to condemn what
happened, answer for the actions of
people you have no idea about.”
After the mass shooting in San
Bernardino last Wednesday, where
fourteen people were killed, there
were fears of revenge attacks on the
Muslim community.
Last week, the President of
Liberty University in the US,
encouraged a crowd of students to
get permits to carry concealed arms,
saying that if more people did, “we
could end those Muslims before
they walked in”. The University,
which is a private Christian college
in Virginia, swiftly released an
official statement clarifying his use
of “those Muslims” to mean “the
Muslim terrorists who attacked
innocents in San Bernardino,
California, and Paris, France”.
Donald Trump this week called
for a “total and complete shutdown”
of US immigration of Muslims.
This would include Muslims from
abroad attempting to get tourist
visas. One Scottish University has
since revoked an honorary degree
they awarded him in 2010. He
remains ahead of his Republican
counterparts in the polls.
Judges and Questions
Dr. Aarathi Prasad is a writer, broadcaster and Imperial
alumnus!

the natural world to invent and innovate.What would you would
mimic to improve our health or capabilities? How would you do
it?”
Prof.Sir Brian Hoskins is Professor of Meteorology at Reading
University and Director of the Grantham Institute for Climate

“As uncertainty is often used as an excuse for inaction, how
should scientists communicate without compromising their
science?”
Prof. Sir John Pendry is a condensed matter theorist, famed for
making the first ‘invisibility cloak’.
“Describe the various ways in which invisibility has been
sought and briefly explain the science behind them.”

The Royal College of Science
Union: Science Challenge is the
UK’s largest student-run science
communication competition and
has developed a reputation for
A-list judges,extravagant prizes and
the annual final which is held at a
swanky central-London venue. The
competition is traditionally open
to all students of Imperial and UK
sixth formers, however this year the
RCSU were delighted to announce
that they are taking submissions
from sixth form-aged students from
around the globe! After all,scientific
discovery has no borders. Entrants
are required to submit a short essay
(or video) in answer to the judges’
questions before the judges present
the winners with their prizes at the
Grand Final.

words of Raven: “Let the challenge
