I
t seems that space is becoming
more and more part of our
daily reality. Last year we
landed on a comet,the creation
of Interstellar produced the most
accurate representation of a black
hole to date, Pluto’s beauty was
finally captured by New Horizons,

Cosmonauts at the Science Museum
Celebrating the birth of the space age
there’s serious talk about sending
one-way manned missions to Mars
further fuelled by the discovery of
liquid water flowing on the surface
of the planet, space planes are
officially a reality and in less then a
week we’ll be casually sending a UK
astronaut to the ISS. No biggie.
The list of achievements goes
on and on, ranging from the
unthinkable to the outright bizarre.
Yet what’s truly amazing is that
our love affair with space only
blossomed about 60 years ago.
Indeed, 1957 was the year that
marked the birth of the space age.
On the 4th
of October, the Soviets
took the world by surprise when
they announced that Sputnik 1 had
written history by becoming the
first artificial satellite to be launched
into orbit around the Earth.
The launch of Sputnik 1 initiated
a long line of Soviet firsts, that
included first human launched into
space,first human to spend 24 hours
in space, first two simultaneous
space missions, first woman in
space, first three-member crew in
space and so on and so forth.
The rapid development of Soviet
Russia’s space program fostered a
climate of anxiety and fear on the
other side of the world. The USA,
weary of the potential of the new
technology in warfare, intensified
space research entering the 20th
century space race.
All this and more is packed in the
Cosmonauts exhibition, running at
the Science Museum till the 13th
of March next year. The exhibition
takes visitors on a journey spanning
over a century, introducing us to
W
ithin the first 15
seconds the listener
is transported to
outer space by the
highly recognisable Space Odyssey
theme tune accompanied by
presenter Simon Jack, announcing
it’s 2075. ‘Ground control to
Major Tom’ by David Bowie is
also used towards the end as it’s a
song everyone associates with outer
space.Transporting the listener into
an alternate, futuristic reality creates
the ambiance needed in radio to
enhance auditory images and make
up for the lack of visual stimulation.
Simon then asks his co-host,a robot
called Emily to go into the archives
to find these following sound-bites,
the forefathers of space travel, the
mysterious mastermind behind
the successes of the Soviet space
program, the Soviet cosmonauts –
icons like Yuri Gagarin (the original
Gaga) who filled the peoples eyes
and dreams with stars – and much,
much more.
The exhibition contains some
of the era’s most iconic artefacts,
such as artwork inspired by our
achievements in space exploration,
the actual spacecraft that took
Valentina Tershkova (first female
cosmonaut) into space and a
mannequin that successfully orbited
the Moon, to name but a few.
It also offers an interesting insight
on the effect of imperialism on
research and innovation, as well
as parallels between 20th
century
Soviet and modern day Russian
imperialism and the whole political
tension between the east and west.
So get your space mojo on and
immerse yourself in one of the
coolest exhibitions within a one-
mile radius from college.

Food on Mars!
Blurring the boundries between science and fiction through radio
allowing the audience to travel back
to the present.
A clip of excited NASA
scientists from 2015 sampling red
romaine space lettuce through
their experiment, introduces the
main topic of survival on Mars.
Dr Richter explains how a box
has been created in order to grow
plants on our neighbouring planet’s
surface. Of course, if astronauts are
consuming food then waste will be
produced, which Dr Lasseur from
the European Space Agency (ESA)
explains will be recycled to produce
water, oxygen and food, creating an
artificial ecosystem. Plants could
also be grown all year round, as
demonstrated by Tom Webster’s
commercial scale urban aquaponics
program. Furthermore, according
to Dr Mahmoud Solh different
food will be available as 150,000
specimens can be stored in a seed
bank vault which could be used to
transport various species into space.
Although astronauts will survive
with diverse diet, I for one wouldn’t
want to spend the rest of my life
as a lone wolf. For example, in the
Martian, Matt Damon is alone,
showing how daunting socialising
in space can be. However, if
astronauts were able to cook in
space it would give them an Earthly
aspect keeping the communication
alive. So, it seems like everything
is set for interplanetary migration
then. Would you go to Mars?

its duration, through the use of

the audience to relate to the world
crafted by Simon Jack, through
music and sound bites from the past
and present.
