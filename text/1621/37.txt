This week you decide
to #hackahairdryer.
Unfortunately, when you
bring it in, its protuding
wires frighten your lecturers,
and you are arrested. You get
invited to the White House,
and live out your life happily
in Qatar.

This week you DDoS
attack the college’s network
to avoid having to work.
Unfortunately, this backfires
when you realise the only
thing you had to attend today
was Mech Eng life drawing.
You can’t hack your way out
of that shit.
This week you remember that
Christmas is the time for
sharing, goodwill and general
generosity of spirit. Bless you
horoscopes writer, we love
you.
This week you give your
grandma your old iPod to
listen to; however, a few
days later you remember you
forgot to take all your music
off and when you visit next,
your grandma is telling you
that she just fucked your
bitch in some gucci flip flops.
This week you are invited
to go ice skating; however,
your eyes glaze over and you
remember being escorted off
the ice last time in the Eden
Project for endangering other
customers. You never did
forgive the staff. Yes ok this
did actually happen to me.
This week you are really
looking forward to christmas
– the baubles, the tree, the
turkey,the christmas pudding
the star – there really is no
better time to stick things up
your ass.
This week at your course’s
Christmas party your lecturer
really pulls through and
brings a Christmas cannabis
cigarette. He does get a bit
too touchy when he’s high
though.
This week you discover that
Kendrick Lamar is playing
Hyde Park next summer so
you send an invite to him
for your after exams party;
however, you don’t expect
his whole production crew
to come and now you’re
smuggling cocaine in every
orifice.
This week in an attempt to
not turn on your house’s
heating, you put all of
your jumpers on and go to
college. Unfortunately, your
appearance looks like you’re
concealing something and
you’re tackled on the tube.
You submit your coursework
late.
This week you really hope
that your secret santa gift will
be appreciated and you wrap
it up immaculately; however,
you accidentally swap the
packages and you give your
Mum the Assdestroyer-3000
with desensitising lube.
This week you realise you
will probably have to do your
share of the cleaning soon, as
the mould you left on that
plate has become sentient.
Eventually you name it
Jeremy and feed it your
leftovers.
This week you are Donald
Trump. Sorry about that.
