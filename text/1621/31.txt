FILM
The top three
Chistmas films
that aren’t
Elf
I
’ve made somewhat of a
faux pas this year: I peaked
too fast and have already
completed my annual
viewing of Elf. It’s the newest
entry to the essential Christmas
watch list – but it is only one of a
long list of films. Let’s take a look
some others:
Grandma Got Run Over
by a Reindeer (2000)
I’m just going to get this one
out of the way. Grandma Got Run
Over by a Reindeer is a straight-
to-video Christmas special based
on a novelty song of the same
name. I have now seen this film
fifteen times – that’s once a year
since I started primary school.
I personally blame early 2000s
Cartoon Network – and their
annual showing of the film – for
its entry to this list. Best utilised
in Christmases spent with
younger relatives, the film should
serve as enjoyable cheesy fun one
late December afternoon.
Love Actually (2003)
It’s a very British Christmas.
Richard Curtis’ story of love
in the Christmas season, told
through several characters, could
be considered simultaneously
amongst the best rom-coms and
Christmas films. Each story
featured in this film – with
the exception of that sodding
drummer kid – can be considered
classics in their own right. Colin
Firth and Emma Thompson’s
stories stand out to me but the
charm here is that everyone has
their own favourites.
It’s a Wonderful Life
(1946)
Come on you whippersnappers.
It’s a Wonderful Life is rightfully
supposed to be the quintessential
Christmas film. A worrying
number of my contemporaries
go against all laws of the universe
and fail to watch this annually –
if at all! George Bailey’s life story,
with its highs and deep lows,is the
perfect reason, during Christmas,
to remember the importance of
good things in life.

Our writers’ top film picks of
2015
1. It Follows
2. Ex Machina
3. Mad Max: Fury Road
4. Inside Out
5. The Martian
Taking the top spot, horror film It
Follows has haunted me since I first
saw it earlier this year. The superb
yet terrifying cinematography
(including some sick 360-degree
pans) and ominous electronic
score from video-game composer
Disasterpeace, result in the best
horror film this side of The Badabook.
As a computer scientist, films
about artificial intelligence have
a special place in my heart, and
Ex Machina is easily the best yet,
thanks to an intelligent script and an
appropriately robotic performance
from rising star Alicia Vikander
(even if it was basically a TED talk
about the Turing test).
With Mad Max: Fury Road,
George Miller flipped the bleak,
male dominated action film
industry on its head. Unbelievable
stunts and excellent editing were
overshadowed by underlying
feminist(-lite) themes and the
badassery of Charlize Theron.
Inside Out provided laughs,
tears, and relief from Pixar’s recent
lineup of awful sequels. It perfectly
captured the emotional turbulence
of moving school, leaving old
friends behind, and the struggle to
fit in (just thinking about the film
makes me sad).
The Martian, a film as funny as it
was scientifically accurate, proved
after a series of disappointing films
that Ridley Scott was still capable
of creating a brilliant blockbuster
(maybe the next Alien might
actually be good).

1. The Lobster
2. Carol
3. Brooklyn
4. Macbeth
The Lobster was pretty much
the only film this year that kept
me frozen in my seat until the
end. Leaving the viewer with that
feeling of uneasiness, common to
pretty much all his films, director
Yorgos Lanthimos really makes you
ponder “What is this thing we call
love?”, the question Sophia Loren
sings as the credits roll. Having
seen Dogtooth and Alps, we need to
praise Lanthimos not only for the
recognition he has obtained, but
also for his characteristic style that
he’s preserved, distinguishing him
as a bona fide auteur. The Lobster
is bold, thought-provoking, and
unnerving. Lanthimos fabricates a
surreal world, which the audience
is lured into sooner or later, left to
wonder how pure and harmless a
feeling love really is.
Onto Carol: you had me at Cate
Blanchett, but lesbian period drama
shot in 16mm? Sold.As well as being
a beautiful film to watch, Rooney
Mara exceeded all my expectations
in her role as Therese, and I thought
the chemistry between her and
Blanchett was extraordinary.
One of the sweetest films I’ve
seen this year, Brooklyn, focuses on
the idea of home, through the story
of Eilis (Saoirse Ronan), an Irish
immigrant who moves to 1950’s
New York in search of a better life.
Her first love interest,Tony (Emory
Cohen) is possibly one of the most
likable protagonists in recent film
history. For its beautiful, unforced
telling of a story so relevant even
in our days, Brooklyn is definitely
worth a mention.
I admit that I didn’t catch every
single one of Shakespeare’s verses in
Macbeth (the Scottish accents made
it pretty hard), but Fassbender and
Cotillard both delivered extremely
powerful performances. I won’t
pretend I knew who Justin Kurzel
was before Macbeth, but if every
movie he directs is as majestic as
this one, I’d like to believe that his
best is yet to come.
DIEGO APARICIO
1. Wild Tales
2. Sicario
3. Mad Max: Fury Road
4. Inherent Vice
5. Carol
6. Love
7. Steve Jobs
8. Ex Machina
9. The Lobster
10. Macbeth
In all, I would say 2015 has been
another great year for cinema. The
films I’ve chosen represent a mix of
those I found to have that unique
balance between entertainment
value and also technical merit.
My top 3: Wild Tales in particular
was the biggest surprise and had
the most impact; an Argentinian
black comedy film written and
directed by Damián Szifron, Wild
Tales is an anthology, composed
of six standalone shorts united by
a common theme of violence and
vengeance. It produced the biggest
grin I’ve had this year after I left the
screening – it was so much fun. If
Tarantino made a Latin-American
film this would be it.
Sicario was beautifully shot and
choreographed with a haunting
soundtrack. The night vision scene
and Benicio Del Toro’s incredible
performance were standouts.
Mad Max: Fury Road showed us
once again what makes the film
medium so unique by being able
to tell and world build the story
through visual design and costume
rather than endless exposition (plus
there’s a dude playing a guitar with
flamethrowers in chase - what more
could you want?).
Note: Special mention and shout
out to films yet to be released in UK
like The Revenant, Hateful Eight,
Anamolisa, Son of Saul, and many
more – curse you distributers!

1. The Lobster
2. Listen Up Philip
3. The Duke of Burgundy
4. Carol
5. Inherent Vice
6. Wild Tales
7. Whiplash
8. A Girl Walks Home Alone
at Night
9. Inside Out
10. World of Tomorrow
When I ran back through my
favourite films of the past year, the
trend that stood out immediately
was an abundance of refreshing
comedy. It’s something that my
pick of the bunch, The Lobster, has
in spades. A deadpan vision of
a dystopian future in which not
finding a suitable partner results in
being transformed into an animal
of your choice, the films starts off
at a specialised hotel where Colin
Farrell’s David is given 45 days to
find a match after his wife leaves
him. The perpetually bemused and
bumbling David is a great foil for
the audience as he journeys through
the daily routine of his new prison;
the dialogue is dry and the absurdity
of the world that Lanthimos creates
is played for laughs with a dark
undercurrent.
As David falls in with rebels,
the imagination and mischievous
spirit are kept, and the film ends
on a high-note reminiscent of a
memorable scene from the director’s
breakout 2010 film Dogtooth. Rarely
does a film so oddball feel so fully-
formed and that’s what makes The
Lobster stand out amongst a crowd
of gorgeous and clever films.
Other highlights of the year
included Alex Ross Perry’s razor-
sharp portrait of a self-centred
author, Listen Up Philip. The Duke of
Burgundy, Peter Strickland’s second
straight smash, is a beguiling,
tender and surprisingly funny look
at a strained master-and-servant
relationship in a world inhabited
solely by women; the stylish
monochrome vampire flick A Girl
Walks…; and a pair of delightful
animations in Pixar’s Inside Out and
World of Tomorrow, an inscrutable
yet gorgeous short from the mind of
the essential Don Herdzfeldt.

1. Carol
2. The Falling
3. Mommy
4. The Duke of Burgundy
5. A Girl Walks Home Alone
at Night
6. The Tribe
7. Timbuktu
8. Tangerine
9. 45 Years
10. The Lobster
Foreign films dominated this
year for me. Abderrahmane
Sissako brought us Timbuktu, a
powerful exploration of growing
Islamist threats in Mali; an urgent
film at its release, the increasing
restlessness of global politics has
just made it more relevant. Ana
Lily Amirpour impressed with her
debut feature, the western Persian
vampire feminist horror A Girl
Walks…, while Ukrainian Myroslav
Slaboshpytskiy shocked us with his
film The Tribe – set in a school for
deaf children, the only sound was
the shocking attacks of violence.
The Lobster saw Yorgos Lanthimos
making his English-language debut,
retaining his jet-black humour.
Several directors made their
welcome return to the screen: Xavier
Dolan picked up the Jury Prize at
Cannes for his fifth film since 2009,
the heart-wrenching Mommy, while
British auteur Peter Strickland
mined the rich seam of 1970s film
he explored in his previous feature,
Berberian Sound Studio, in the richly
realized The Duke of Burgundy.
Andrew Haigh’s long-awaited
follow up to his debut Weekend
was released: 45 Years, an evocative

exploration of an aging couple, with
stunning central performances.
Elsewhere, Tangerine broke new
ground with its central duo of trans
women smashing down barriers
– the fact that it was filmed on an
iPhone was just by the by.
I have already spent enough
words on the beauty of Carol, so I
will not dwell on it here. Suffice to
say it is one of the most ravishing,
emotionally layered films I have
seen in recent years.
SpeakingofCarols,CarolMorley’s
film The Falling is perhaps the film
that has stayed with me the longest;
ever since I saw it in April I’ve been
thinking about it, not least due to
the beautiful cinematography, and
haunting score from Tracey Thorn.
FRED FYLES
1. Whiplash
2. Me & Earl & the Dying Girl
3. Inside Out
4. Hinterland
5. Inherent Vice
6. A Most Violent Year
7. Mad Max: Fury Road
8. Straight Outta Compton
9. Macbeth
10. Dope
2015 in film wasn’t quite the stellar
run of masterpiece after masterpiece
that 2014 turned out to be, and as
a result it’s felt like something of
a comedown. However, as truly
excellent films have been fewer and
far between this year, standouts
from the slew of weighty bravura
pieces and lacklustre blockbusters
have appeared all the better – and
have been all the more appreciated.
These standouts came in all shapes
and sizes, from the beautifully
intimate and atmospheric
Hinterland and the sprawling,
hilariously hazy Inherent Vice, to the
epic, fist-pumping sweep of Straight
Outta Compton and the thick,
brooding darkness of Macbeth and
A Most Violent Year.
There were even some decidedly
mainstream films that knocked it
out of the park: Inside Out is possibly
Pixar’s best film of the past ten years.
At a time when action franchises
have in essence started taking
the piss (Ant-Man, Terminator:
Genisys…), the latest Mad Max
emerged as the most visceral and
breath-taking action movie in
recent memory, and a milestone in Photo Credit: Cold Open
masterful action filmmaking of The
Dark Knight-like proportions.
Best of all was the kooky,hilarious,
and yet genuinely touching Me &
Earl & the Dying Girl,and Whiplash.
It would feel like cheating to include
Whiplash in this year’s top ten list
if it wasn’t just such a damn great
film – it hit UK cinemas way back
in January, but nothing this year (or
indeed last year) has topped it. It’s
a genuinely thrilling dual-character
study of a boy who wants to be
the best and a man who thinks he
knows what it takes to be the best,
with pitch-perfect performances
and an ending more stunning than
any ending has any right to be –
even the thought of it will give me
chills for years to come.

Hot or Not?
2015 Edition
Noah Baumbach
This year saw the fêted
director release not one, but
two films into the cinemas.
While We’re Young garnered
rave reviews, and Mistress
America saw him teaming up
with Greta Gerwig again.
Streaming Sites
Netflix has been changing
the game for years, but
Amazon Prime got in on
the action this year. Beasts
of No Nation and Chi-Raq
are two critically-acclaimed
upcoming films produced by
streaming sites.
Cate Blanchett
Blanchett gave us
four critically acclaimed
performances this year,
including Carol and Truth.
She’s well on target for the
Best Actress Oscar come
February.
Ryan Gosling
Poor Ryan. After a string
of acclaimed roles, the actor
has tried to take a turn in
the director’s seat, writing,
producing, and directing his
feature Lost River. Booed at
Cannes, the film completely
flopped at the box office,
and had overwhelmingly
negative revies. Next time,
eh?
Bradley Cooper
Cooper may have started
the year stong, with a Best
Actor nod for his role in
American Sniper, but he saw
out the year with a main
role in Burnt, a film that
was widely condemned.
Peter Bradshaw, writing in
The Guardian, called his
charater “a fantastically
tiresome prat”.Ouch.
Lad films
The fact that an Entourage
film was made is a blight on
humanity. The fact it was
completely panned is our
redemption.
