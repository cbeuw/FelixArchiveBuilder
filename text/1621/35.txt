B
ehold, it’s Christmas time
already! Soon, University
shall be finished for the
term, and we will all
be facing the holidays. Between
relatives, revision, and exhaustion
from the final weeks of term, now
is the time of year that can end up
more stressful than enjoyable. So
whatever your situation,be it visiting
home or staying in London over the
winter break, remember that you are
allowed to take some time out for
yourself. So here are some seasonal
self-care ideas to get you through
the holiday!
Mint candy cane hot
chocolate:
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
1-2 tablespoons of sugar (to taste)
~1 cup of milk/soy milk/almond
milk
2-3 drops peppermint essential oil
1 candy cane
Optional:
Whipped cream
Crushed candy cane
Pour a little milk, the cocoa and
sugar into a saucepan and mix to a
paste. Then add the rest of the milk
and heat it over the saucepan until
sufficiently hot. Add a few drops of
peppermint essential oil. Stir the
mixture and then pour into your
mug of choice.
If you like, you can now add
whipped cream to the top and
sprinkle crushed candy cane on top.
Finally, stir with the candy cane
and enjoy!
Orange pomander
decoration:
2 oranges
1 handful of cloves
6-8 rolls of cinnamon
1 red ribbon
1 needle
some thread
Take one orange and cut it into
slices.Baketheseintheovenonalow
heat until they dry out. Meanwhile,
tie the ribbon firmly around the
second orange, so that you can hang
the orange from the ribbon. Then
poke the cinnamon end-first into
the orange – if piercing the skin is
hard, poke a hole with the needle
first.
Take the needle and thread it,
making sure to loop the thread
several times so it is strong enough
to hang the orange and spices on
it. Then alternate the dried orange
slices with rolls of cinnamon,
stringing them on the thread. Tie
off the thread in a loop at the top
and then tie the other end of the
thread to the ribbon. Finally, hang
the orange by the loop on the thread.
DIY Christmas tree:
1 piece of card (A4 or A3
depending on how large you want
your ‘tree’)
Several sheets of tissue paper in
green, brown, red and yellow (and
any other desired colours)
1 hole-punch (if desired)
Scissors
Glue
1 string of fairy lights
Sellotape
First, draw the outline of a
Christmas tree on your card –
remember to include the trunk and
base of the tree! Now cut out the tree
and either hole-punch or cut holes
in the tree where you want the lights
to go. Now take the tissue paper
and scrunch it up into small balls.
Glue these onto the tree to fill in
the main section of the tree, leaving
some gaps for any other colours you
want to put in to represent baubles,
and leaving out the very top of the
tree.Use scrunched-up brown tissue
paper for the trunk, and use red
paper for the base/pot for your tree.
Finally, take one scrunched ball of
yellow paper and stick it to the very
top to represent the star. Fill in any
spaces you left with baubles. Make
sure to avoid sticking paper directly
over any holes you left for the fairy
lights! Wait for it to dry.
Now you can push the LED
lights through the holes in the tree
so they poke out amongst the tissue
paper. If you need to, use sellotape
to secure the lights in place on the
back. Now you can prop up the tree,
turn on the lights, and you have a
small DIY Christmas tree!
Mobius strip paper
chains:
Lots of coloured paper (red,green,
gold and silver is suggested as
seasonal)
Scissors
Glue
Seasonal Self-Care Recipes
Christmas Cheer – Have yourself a merry little Christmas!
Cut your paper into strips. Then
take one strip and twist it once,
before securing the ends together
to form a Mobius strip. Take the
next desired colour strip and do the
same, but link this Mobius strip
with the first. Continue to make a
paper chain that is decorative and a
bit geeky (like all the best things!).
Fir tree diffuser:
1 packet reed diffuser sticks
1 small bottle
¼ cup water
¼ cup alcohol/vodka
20-25 drops fir tree/pine
essential oil
Mix the water, vodka and essential
oil together, and pour into the small
bottle. Then rest the diffuser sticks
in the bottle. The scent should
wick up the reeds and diffuse into
and around the room. Special tip:
if you turn the reeds upside down
regularly, the scent keeps stronger
and fresher.
I hope that you remember to look
after yourselves as well as your other
commitments this holiday.
Christmas time can be difficult,
whether or not you are with family.
So remember, have a fun time and
treat yourself to some TLC!
