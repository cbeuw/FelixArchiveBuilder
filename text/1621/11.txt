ARTS
Architects, not artists win theTurner Prize
Indira Mallik
Arts Editor
Y
ou know it’s time to
worry about the state of
contemporary art when
the judges decide award
the £25,000 prize to a group of
architects. Has the prestigious
award, no stranger to controversy,
finally jumped the shark in the most
spectacular style possible?
The truth is, the group of
20-somethings, none of whom are
even fully qualified as architects,
have created in the Granby Four
Streets Projects, work that is head
and shoulder above the rest of their
competition.
The other nominees included,
Nicole Wermers. Her installation
Infrastruktur, featured vintage fur
coats stitched onto steel designer
chairs. It is an installation so devoid
of real concept or power of execution
that to muster any emotion other
than abject apathy towards it
requires Herculean power of will.
Bonnie Camplin’s work, a room
filled with television screens blaring
out amateur videos from conspiracy
theorists, was more engaging than
Wermer’s, that is to say, it barely
limped over the ridiculously low
bar that Wermer had set. Janice
Kerbal shunned the visual to favour
a cacophony of noise and discordant
voices, composing an operatic
performance of a series of mishaps
that occur to the fictional, hapless
Doug.
In order to compose the pieces,
she undertook extensive training
in musical theory. Theoretically
foolproof it may have been, but by
all accounts the practical version left
much to be desired. Each of these
artists produced highly academic
work, work that few outside the
rarefied world of the upper echelons
of art can relate to, work that is
ultimately rendered cold and sterile
compared to that of Assemble’s.
The group undertook the urban
regeneration of a series of terraced
houses in Toxteth, Liverpool.
The four streets that make up the
Granby neighbourhood had been
left to rot since the riots in the area
in the 1980s. The neighbourhood,
large enough to house 200, now
only contains 70 residents.
Until ten years ago, the area was
akin to a ghost town. Council after
council had promised to turn the
situation around but nothing had
ever been accomplished. Finally,
the residents took matters into
their own hands and formed The
Granby Four Streets Community
Land Trust and began to paint the
abandoned houses, plant the streets,
and run a community market to
breathe life back into the derelict
streets.
Assemble have taken this further,
and have dared to dream bigger.
They have offered their expertise
in renovating unusual spaces to the
residents to renovate the houses
with gathered materials. Assemble’s
previous work includes creating a
pop-up cinema from an abandoned
petrol station, and creating a public
arts space under a motorway
in North London. These have
been fairytale like constructions,
beautiful, surreal spaces that leave a
lasting impression, Assemble have
built something of a reputation
of turning all they touch to gold;
their HQ at Yardhouse, once just
another part of a grey and tired
looking set of factories in the East
End, has now been transformed
into a building covered in ice cream
coloured concrete tile; something of
a Instagram mecca.
The renovated Granby Four
Streets houses have the same magic
about them; where a floor was
missing, they have simply created
a double height space. As a result,
unexpected spaces have sprung up:
towering ceilings, cathedral like
hallways. The project has been an
exercise in creative thinking and
ambitious vision.
It’s not just about the eye candy
though, in Granby Four Streets,
Assemble have created a plan for
a sustainable future. They have
established the Granby workshops,
employing local residents to create
handmade home furnishings from
scavenged materials.
Assemble’s work may not be art
as we know it, but revolutionary
work rarely fits snugly in one box.
The Granby Four Streets Project
has changed real lives, and created
something beautiful and lasting.
I would be hard pressed to find a
better definition of what art should
be.
Unexpected,
magical
