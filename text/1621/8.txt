A
norexia nervosa is
a potentially life-
threatening eating
disorder that is
characterized by a psychological
disturbance in the perception
of a person’s own body weight.
People with anorexia nervosa have
a devastating fear of weight gain,
and subsequently adopt damaging
dietary habits in order to prevent
it. For this reason, they are unable
to maintain a minimal normal body
weight. Although anorexia nervosa
most commonly affects women in
their mid-teens, there has been a
recent increase in the number of
cases seen in young men. Prevalence
ofanorexianervosaishardtoidentify
since a large proportion of people
affected choose not to seek help,
and therefore remain unidentified.
However,the Department of Health
estimates that the total number of
people affected is approximately
four million.
A typical case of a patient with
anorexia nervosa is that of a teenager
who may be of average weight or
slightly overweight, and decides to
begin a new lifestyle plan to lose
weight. As they lose weight, they
receive feedback from others that
further stimulates the weight-losing
behaviour – positive reinforcement.
The dependence on the reward for
this behaviour becomes so strong
that even when an ideal (or desired)
weight is achieved, the anorexic
person is unable to stop their weight
loss.
Anorexic people usually have an
unforgiving diet, with obsessive
behaviour regarding the avoidance
of fatty food, strict calorie counting
and persistent weight monitoring.
They may also take appetite-
suppressants, self-induce frequent
vomiting, and abuse laxatives.
Physically, patients may not appear
to be starving. However, there are
somecharacteristicfeaturesofpeople
with anorexia that include lanugo
hair, callouses on the dorsum of the
dominant hand with enamel erosion
(due to purging) and swelling of the
parotid and submandibular glands.
The primary metabolic problem in
patients is that of malnutrition due
to starvation-induced changes.
The long-term health implications
of anorexia nervosa include both
somatic and psychosocial effects.
Somatic effects, largely due to the
malnutrition, include osteoporosis,
infertility, anaemia and poor organ
function (particularly dental and
renal). The psychosocial effects, also
well document, include poor social
functioning, sexual disinterest and
suicidal thoughts.

As anorexia nervosa is considered
primarily a psychological disorder,
it requires a clinical diagnosis.
There are no definitive diagnostic
tests, however a medical evaluation
can be made of the multi-organ
effects of starvation. Common tests
would include a full blood count,
urine analysis, metabolic panel,
electrocardiogram and physical and
mental status examination.
The main goal in management
of anorexia is restoring adequate
nutrition in patients. Ideally,
intervention should occur before
the malnutrition precipitates
any secondary physiological and
psychological problems. In most
patients, refeeding is done slowly
(to reduce the risk of refeeding
syndrome). Fluid and electrolyte
replacement is also very important,
as patients are often dehydrated
and have lost a lot of electrolytes
through vomiting and purging.
Psychological therapy has proven
to be the most successful treatment
for patients so far, according to
National Institute for Healthcare
and Excellence (NICE) guidelines.
It focuses on promoting weight gain
and healthy eating and promotes
psychological recovery. A variety
of psychological therapies are used
in practice and include: cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT), group
therapy, family therapy, dietary
counselling and interpersonal
therapy. Patients often respond best
to family therapy, which is proven
to achieve as well as maintain
remission.
Pharmacological therapy
in anorexia nervosa includes
antidepressants (tricyclic

antidepressants and selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
SSRIs), antihistamines and
antipsychotics. However, there is
insufficient evidence to suggest that
these have any significant effect on
weight gain compared to placebo
during multi-modal inpatient
treatment.Limited current evidence
suggests that fluoxetine (SSRI) may
reduce the likelihood of relapse after
inpatient weight restoration.
Overall, the current clinical
picture is not optimistic. Although
various forms of psychological and
pharmacological treatment for
anorexia are useful in the induction
and maintenance of remission,
evidence collected by NICE
suggests that long-term benefits
may not be sustained. Often, the
focus of treatment shifts in the long
term towards improving quality
of life through managing the
secondary complications of anorexia
nervosa.
Perhaps, if it were possible to
identify at-risk individuals at
an earlier stage, and implement
measures to prevent the onset of
the secondary complications of
anorexia nervosa, a lot of the disease
burden on the individual (as well
as the healthcare service) could be
alleviated?
Although it has been over 150
years since French neuropsychiatrist
Ernest Charles Lasègue first
described anorexia nervosa, we
are still far away from being able
to help patients either before they
develop secondary complications,
or even to help them recover from
those complications in a timely and
efficient manner.

The launch of LISA Pathfinder
O
ne century ago Albert
Einstein predicted the
existenceofgravitational
waves in his General
Theory of Relativity. However, they
have not been directly detected yet,
as their effect is tiny and can only
be appreciated when looking at
huge bodies such as planets, stars
or galaxies. The successful launch
of LISA Pathfinder, carried out on
the 3rd
of December, is the first step
of an ambitious project to finally
confirm their existence.
Gravitational waves are supposed
to be ripples in the fabric of space-
time, generated by accelerating
massive objects. If they do exist,
their nature would be analogous to
that of electromagnetic waves (light,
microwaves, X rays etc), which are
the result of accelerating electrical
charges. Einstein’s theory predicts
that gravitational waves transport
energy as gravitational radiation,
and that when passing a distant
observer, that observer finds space-
time distorted by the effects of
strain.
Let us think of the explosion
of a distant star at the very end
its life (a phenomenon known
as a supernova). Gravitational
waves from this violent explosion
travel across the Universe almost
unimpeded, unlike light, which gets
In the search of gravitational waves 100 years after the the birth of general relativity
absorbed by gas and dust. When
they pass thought the Earth they
produce minute changes in the size
of our planet, but only by about a
millionth of the size of an atom,
making them almost impossible to
measure.
European Space Agency’s LISA
Pathfinder is the first gravitational
laboratory for fundamental physics
that has been launched into space
and will test the cutting edge
technologies needed to detect
and measure gravitational waves
in the future. The spacecraft will
operate at a distance of 1.5 million
kilometres from Earth, between our
planet and the Sun, orbiting a stable
virtual point called the first Sun-
Earth Lagrange point (L1). There,
an experiment will attempt to
demonstrate whether it is possible
to free a pair of test masses from
all forces except gravity. This is an
essential underlining condition to
detect gravitational waves in space.
LISA Pathfinder will do so by
monitoring the motion of two
identical 46mm gold-platinum
cubes that will be free-floating in
space, 38 centimetres from one
another. Between them, a laser
interferometer will measure the
relative separation of the two
cubes to unprecedented accuracy
as external and internal forces
disturb the spacecraft around them.
If the experiment proves to be
sensitive enough, it will be able to
measure the tiny movements of the

masses caused by the passage of a
gravitational wave.
Scaled up, it is like tracking the
distance between the tops of the
Shard in London and the One
World Trade Centre in New York,
and noticing any changes down
to just fractions of the width of
a human hair. “We use the laser
interferometer to bounce light
between the proof masses and the
optical structure that we built in
Glasgow,”says Dr Harry Ward from
Glasgow University, UK.
However, to ensure that the
experiment works correctly, it is
crucial that gravity is the only force
acting on both cubes. This means
that they must be able to float in
their respective vacuum chambers
without being in contact with
any part of the spacecraft. This is
extremely difficult as the spacecraft
will be subjected to perturbing
forces that, if not cancelled, will
force it to move and hit the cubes,
ruining the experiment.
In order to avoid this, a precision
propulsion system with several
micro-thrusters will have the
mission to keep the spacecraft in
perfect position. Thus, for every
little perturbation that affects the
aircraft the micro-thrusters must
produce an identical reaction to
cancel it, allowing the cubes to float
undisturbed.
“LISA Pathfinder is paving
the way for a future large space
observatory that ultimately will
directly observe and precisely
measure gravitational waves,” said
François Auque, head of space
systems at Airbus Defence and
Space. “These minute distortions
in space-time require very sensitive
and highly precise measuring
technologies, the performance of
which can only be tested in a space
environment.’”
When and if LISA Pathfinder
proves the effectiveness of this
innovative technology, the next step
will be another,much bigger mission
involving up to three spacecraft
separated by five million kilometres.
Each spacecraft will carry a cube
inside and again, a laser will be used
to monitor their relative position.
The huge distances between the
spacecrafts, will allow scientists
to detect very low frequency
gravitational waves from very large
objects such as supermassive black
holes at the centres of galaxies.
If everything goes well, this
future mission, named 2034-
LISA, will open a new window to
our gravitational universe. “LISA
Pathfinder is a mission looking into
a new science, a new way of doing
astronomy,” explains Cesar García,
LISA Pathfinder project manager
(ESA). “And this new era in space
science, first predicted by Albert
Einstein just one hundred years ago,
will change forever the way we see
the Universe around us.”
