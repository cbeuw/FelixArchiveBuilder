How to build a gingerbread house...
out of science
This is Imperial, and we can’t just build something without thinking it through
gives it its strength.
If the gingerbread is too soft, it
may buckle under the weight of
anything on top of it. Gingerbread
is also much stronger under
compression than in tension (I’ve
got the data to back it up), so bear
that in mind in your design.
The glue
For construction, use royal icing
sugar (or a mix of normal icing
sugar and powdered egg white) and
a few drops of water or lemon juice
to bring it into a paste. You need
to be able to pipe the icing, but the
stiffer it is, the better it will hold
your gingerbread together. Put it in
a piping bag (you can make these
out of baking paper or even ziploc
bags,just Google it) and you’re good
to go.
The construction
It will take at least two people
to assemble your gingerbread
masterpiece, depending on the
design – one to hold the pieces in
place, and the other to pipe icing
into the joint. Don’t forget to use
the icing to stick the gingerbread
down too, or it won’t be as strong.
Once some pieces are in place,
add more pieces that support each
other, or place something to hold
the gingerbread while the icing sets
a bit before adding more. Try and
let each layer set as long as you can
before building up.
The decoration
Onceyou’vebuiltyourmasterpiece,
you need to make it look extra
beautiful. Simply take more icing
and bejewel your gingerbread with
sweets and chocolate and whatever
you like. You get bonus points for
integrating the decoration into the
design rather than making it look
like you’ve thrown a sweetshop at it.
The eating
This is the best part. You don’t
need my help.

re you impressed by the
gingerbread towers on
the right? Do you want
to bake a slightly less
time-consuming version of it to
impress your friends and family this
Christmas? Well, you can.
The design
First, you need to decide what you
want to make. I suggest sketching
it out and using your high school
geometry skills (or CADing the
design if you’re taking this really
seriously). Keep in mind that
gingerbread expands slightly when
you bake it, so leave some leeway
in your design. Once you’ve got the
shapes for all of your pieces, cut out
templates, and start cooking.
The recipe
I could convert all measurements
to sensible units,but instead I’m just
going to give you a conversion rate:
1oz=28.34g
16oz flour
1 tbsp dried ground ginger
½ tbsp ground cinnamon
6oz butter or margarine
8oz soft brown sugar
1 egg
4-6 tbsp golden syrup
The method
Place the flour and spices in a
bowl with the butter and rub the
butter into the flour to form a
coarse crumb. Then add the sugar
and combine, before adding the
remaining ingredients and mashing
together with your hands until it
forms a dough. Start with 4tbsp
of golden syrup and add more if it
won’t come together.
Roll out the dough to around
0.5-1cm thick on a floured surface
(alternatively do this between
sheets of greaseproof paper to
stop it sticking), and then cut into
the desired shapes. For building,
precision is key, so keep it as neat as
you can.
Bake on a baking tray lined with
baking paper at 180°C for 6-8
minutes, or until the gingerbread is
an even brown colour. Once it’s out
the oven, let it cool completely on a
wire rack while it sets.
The science
For sturdier constructions, roll any
load-bearing pieces slightly thinner,
and bake them for a bit longer at
a lower temperature so that they
are extra stiff. After a day or so
they’ll soften again so that they’re
actually edible. The wheat starch
will undergo a transition from a
crystalline to a glassy state during
baking and cooling – this is what
