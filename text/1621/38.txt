Hertfordshire Hurricanes beat Imperial

T
he Immortals travelled
to Hertfordshire for
their penultimate game
this calendar year against
the Hurricanes. After suffering a
defeat against this very team the
previous weekend, the Immortals
were desperate to turn their season
around, but it wasn’t enough. The
game ended with a disappointing
result of 37-0 to the Hurricanes.
The first quarter started out
strong as the defence took to the
field. Run and pass plays were
shut down effectively, and with
the help of multiple false starts
from the opposing team the game
was looking positive. Offence also
came out strong, with Emanuel ‘is
going fishing’ Olagbaju bulldozing
through their defensive lines.
However, our recurring issue of
pass protection resulted in a couple
of sacks on our quarterback. The
second quarter was a tough time
for the offensive team, as we weren’t
able to earn many much-needed first
downs to advance downfield. The
defence nevertheless were firing,
with Rayane ‘tie-red’ Jackson flying
all over the field making massive
tackles, supported by the rest of the
front seven flowing heavy to the
ball and our defensive backs being
able to stop catches downfield.
With one minute left in the first
half, Emanuel Olagbaju once again
bulleted through their defensive
lines, gaining significant yards.
The second half seemed like
a different game for the offence
overall. With the help of our
offensive linemen, we were able to
open up a gap for our running back,
Emanuel, which then proceeded
to tear through their defense. At
one point, he was dragging one of
the Hurricane’s players with him
as he was sprinting downfield – a
nightmarish flashback to training
for ‘Spewy’ Will Coidan. Reese
‘Killem’ also turned on his wheels
and sprinted downfield with the
ball as if he were, for some reason,
lighter than he was a few days ago.
A special mention to David ‘reckons
he can truck Spewy’Rovick, coming
on for the first time this season as
our quarterback. Defensively, we
were consistent and executed our
assignments really well.
Yet another disappointing day
for the Immortals, however, this
season has not ended yet, and with
the uncertainty of the premiership
league this year, it is definitely not
too late to turn our season around.
We would like to thank everyone
on our sideline who came down to
support us at Hertfordshire and
we hope they return this Sunday
when we face the newly-promoted
Kingston Cougars on their grounds.

Imperial smashed East London 107-20 last week
I
n the middle of
#ImperialGirlsCan week,
we made our way to Heston
Sports Centre last Wednesday
to face East London. Having lost
against them by very few points in
our first game, we were all excited
and motivated to win this match!
Upon receiving our new
ImperialGirlsCan warm-up shirts,
we witnessed our Imperial Men’s 2nd
basketball team, who are defending
the 1st
rank in their division,
confidently beat West London.
Then it was time for us to compete.
East London came to Heston
Sports Centre with a reduced
squad, and we used the advantages
that this gave us within the first few
seconds of starting the match. We
started with a 14-0 run in the first
few minutes of the game – this gave
us great momentum to execute our
game strategy! All game we kept
up defensive pressure, rotated all
our players regularly and ended up
finishing the first half with a lead of
44-11.
The second half continued just as
successfully: we started with a 12-0
run in the first three minutes, and
the score kept going up as the girls
from East London became more
and more tired. Just seconds before
the end of the game the score was
99-20, but then Kylie (eight points)
finished with a buzzer beater and
got us into three digits!
As if this wasn’t enough reason
to celebrate, we also showed a great
team performance – five of our
eleven girls scored double-digits:
Olga (22), Danielle (21), Alina (15),
Sophia (13) and Jenny (10).
With this win we’re finishing the
calendar year as 2nd
place in division
1A, a great position to start into
the second half of the season. But
not only the Women’s basketball
team had an excellent first half of
the season: Our undefeated Men’s
1st
team and the Men’s 2nd
team are
both top in their league and have
high ambitions to get promoted.
So keep your fingers crossed,
and stop by some time to see our
three teams compete in Ethos and
Heston next term!
