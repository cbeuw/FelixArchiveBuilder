The Phoenix
perimeter
dark it is without power, don’t you say commander?
black the ink of space.
/
crying, the wookies are. limp are their paws.
sat like bears, like crying boulders they are.
separate from each others’ their shoulders have become.
/
look not to me for assuredness commander. see,
for three days without my stick i have been-
fallen over many times, in the dark.
but learned now to catch myself with the force i have.
like a seizure i must look, hmm? in the dark corridors
falling and catching myself
/
swimming into the sea, the wookies are. swimming away from each other.
hurting, their practised legs are, the way fire hurts trees.
crying into them the sea is, the way it cries into boulders on the land.
/
but in the dark, no-one can see, hmm?
so the old man falling over, it is the same as the old man walking,
the old man dancing, hmm?
/
islands the wookies reach. alone each one of them is.
trees hang on to the mist, with tree-hands,
reach down to the wookies, cover them up,
talk to them.
/
you laugh, commander. for weeks without hope you have been.
wandered the ship you have.
stroked the cables of the ship,
its engines too, in the dark, tender.
