IBM in sexism row over #hackahairdryer
T
his week, a misjudged
campaign on the part of
IBM to get women into
science faced backlash
online after being dubbed sexist.
The initiative focussed on getting
women into STEM subjects by
encouraging them to “hack a
hairdryer”. Many women argued
that by playing up to the gender
stereotype of women caring more
about their looks, the campaign had
lost sight of the gender stereotype it
was trying to lambaste.
Many female scientists on Twitter
adopted the IBM’s #hackahairdryer
hashtag to point out the
contradiction.
“That’s okay, IBM, I’d rather build
satellites instead, but good luck
witht that whole #HackAHairDryer
thing,” said one user.

Imperial network brought down by cyber attack
O
n Tuesday, Office
365 email accounts,
TurnItIn, and other
online services at
Imperial were disrupted due to
a DDoS attack on the national
network for universities.
Janet, which runs .ac.uk domains,
reported “disruption” from 9:24
onwards on Tuesday, causing
“intermittent service” to users
throughout the day.
Students across the country were
prevented from submitting work on
time, using some library services,
and watching Netflix on college
grounds.
A DDoS attack involves the
installation of malware on multiple
computers before instructing them
to access a site simultaneously,
causing failure due to the volume
of traffic. ‘Botnets’ of malware-
infected computers can range from
thousands to millions for one
attack. These Distributed Denial
of Service hacks account for up
to a third of outage incidents, and
experts estimate that 2000 occur per
day. Such attacks can be purchased
for as little as £100 online.
The academic network stopped
updating the situation on its major
incident Twitter page as it believed
these details were aiding hackers.
The Joint Information Systems
Committee, which runs Janet, was
forced to shut down its own website

Female scientists wondered whether men would be asked to hack a beard trimmer
“I leave hairdryer fixing to the
men, I’m too busy making nanotech
and treating cancer” said another .
The mocking continued
throughout the day, until IBM
eventually decided to pull the
campaign. By then, even the
London Fire Brigade had chipped
in on Twitter, saying: “We’re staying
out of the sexism debate, however,
we’d suggest that it’s generally a bad
idea & possibly a bit dangerous to
#HackAHairDryer”.
IBM said afterwards that the
campaign had “missed the mark
for some”. They’d been running the
initiative since October, but began
publicising it again on Monday.
On a webpage for the scheme
on IBM’s website, the company
described the “hair-raising
misconceptions” about women in
science that were putting women
off.This has since been removed.

They have a female CEO, Ginni
Rometty, and have always claimed
to have paved the way for women
in technology, saying on their
website: “Where many companies
proudly date their affirmative action
programs to the 1970s, IBM has
been creating meaningful roles for
female employees since the 1930s.”
This is the second time this year
a company has gone awry in its PR
pursuit for women in STEM. EDF

when it too was subjected to another
DDoS attack.This made it harder to
update IT departments and students
on the network’s status.
By 5pm, Imperial’s ICT Service
reported that network services had
been restored in college.
A representative from ICT told
FELIX,“The disruption was patchy;
it was often the case that only one
critical component of a service was
unavailable – the sign on process for
Office 365, for example – but the
rest was fine. We were able to put
in place a number of work-arounds
to overcome these situations”.
“There is not a great deal students
can do apart from making every
effort to ensure their personal
machines do not get enrolled into
bot-nets through the accidental
installation of malware. Install
security patches ASAP and keep
virus and malware-checkers up to
date!”
This news comes after Office
365 went down in parts of the UK
and Europe last Thursday, due to
an outage with Microsoft’s cloud
platform, Azure.
