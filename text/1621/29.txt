FELIX’s top music picks of 2015
Our Albums of the Year
Our writers pick their Albums of the Year
EP of the Year
Gone is the warm pink of
Sunbather now replaced by dark
uneven strokes. Whilst the album
feels angrier and more abrasive,
the overall structures and sounds
that Deafheaven use have changed
very little. Thrashing black metal
always seamlessly transitions to the
uplifting melodies that band are
famous for. You’ll need a lyric sheet
to discern Clarke’s screeching, but
when you do everything begins to
make sense: “A multiverse of fuchsia
/ And violet surrenders to blackness
now.”

For the last four years, Julia
Holter has kept on getting closer.
Her 2011 debut, Tragedy, was an
abstract tone-poem, influenced
by experimental electronica, and
inspired by Euripides’ Hippolytus;
her 2012 follow-up,Ekstasis,seemed
more assured, the mumbled lyrics
replaced with clear-cut vocoders,
Holter singing as if through a crystal
microphone; 2013’s Loud City Song
– as well as being a highlight of that
year – showcased her aptitude for
jazz, with bombastic sax and drums
kicking her baroque pop styling up
a notch. And now we have Have You
in My Wilderness, and a sense that
Holter has finally arrived.
From the opener, ‘Feel You’, with
its harpsichord opening line, and
punchy drums, we are clearly made
skittering drumming propelling the
clarity of Holter’s vocals.
However, things have not all
changed. Holter has retained her
incredible skill with instrumentation
– there is never a sense that any
element is wasted; every blast
of strings and piano interlude is
calculated with extreme precision.
Elsewhere she explores her lower
register, sounding like a present-day
Nico, all chilly elongated vowels.
Her lyrical content, although more
up front, remains as dense as ever.
‘Vasquez’ is named after a 19th
century bandido from California,
while ‘How Long?’ sees her
inhabiting Christopher Isherwood’s
character of Sally Bowles. The
album closes with ‘Have You in My
Wilderness’, where Holter finished
with the repeated refrain, ‘Tell me,
why do I feel you running away’.
Nothing could be further from the
truth – Have You In My Wilderness
cements Holter’s place as one of the
great musicians of our generation,
and I await with bated breath what
closer contact will bring.

Have You In My
Wilderness
My favourite album of the year
has to be Heaven Is Earth by
Self Defence Family. Featuring
weird half shouted vocals, layered
jamming guitars and wonderfully
simple lyrics (as well as their
confrontational internet presence)
that have made Self Defence such a
strong force in the post-punk scene.
This album itself shows the full
emotional variety that SDF are
capable of, with the uplifting ‘David
Sim’ cohabiting within the same
album as the austere ‘In My Defens
Self Me Defend,’ creating a varied
interesting experience from start to
finish. My favourite track on this
album is the poignant ‘Basic Skills’
which shows SDF at their very best.

The Best Songs of 2015
8. New Bermuda 7. Divers 6. Vulnicura 5. To Pimp A Butterfly
4. In Colour 3. Art Angels 2. Product 1. Carrie & Lowell
Joanna Newsom’s fourth release
is one of the year’s most complex.
The multi-instrumentalist explores
time and love in an hour of
fantastical musical arrangement
with the help of members of the
Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.
On ‘Leaving The City’ she plays the
harp and piano, interspersed with
metallic flutters of a marxophone
and proggy guitar. Yet somehow her
breathless singing is not drowned
out. And she wonderfully contrasts
this with moments where it’s just
her and the harp.
An album infused with the
sounds of electronic producer Arca,
Vulnicura is heavily influenced by
the modern electronic scene and
hip-hop. Like Arca’s recent work,
there are times where the album
is wonky, mixing stretched synths
with violins.Throughout the record,
Björk voice seems a perfect match
for the venezuelan producer.
For some,Arca’s odd sounds might
be alienating so Björk released an
acoustic version. It’s listenable, but
feels oddly empty in comparison to
the original.
Kendrick Lamar’s groundbreaking
hip-hop album (which has seen him
nominated for eleven Grammys)
was released at a time of resurgence
for radical Black politics in the US.
It’s an incredibly confident record;
he reads lines of a poem at the
end of each song before reciting
the whole thing again on ‘Mortal
Man.’Then at the end of the album
he interviews Tupac by inserting
himself into a recording. Kendrick
seems intent on trying to change
the world: “As I lead this army make
room for mistakes and depression.”
Earlier this year, our Editor-
in-Chief called the album: “a
masterpiece in execution of a wide-
spread appeal,boys in ironic Adidas,
white people at carnival vibe.” So, I
guess it has to be on our list. Steel
pans were essential to Jamie xx’s
early solo work. While he’s come
a long way since the sublime ‘Far
Nearer,’ this steely sound still
permeates his music like a weird,
translucent Instagram filter. If you
haven’t yet, listen to the xx-esque
‘Loud Places‘ and ‘Good Times,’
two defining songs of 2015.
A vastly different album to Visions
yet infinitely superior. Grimes’
music is now more guitar driven and
borders on bubblegum pop. Like an
angel from heaven,Art Angels, glows
with a radiance. It stays within
the confines of pop music but
transcends the tired tropes of the
musical industrial complex. There’s
a hate track aimed at Pitchfork and
a song “written from the perspective
of Al Pacino.”While it might not be
coherent as Visions, the songs stand
on their own: catchy, uplifting, and
accessible.
Introspective and hauntingly
beautiful, Carrie & Lowell is a
stark contrast to the explosive The
Age of Adz. It’s as raw as Sufjan
Stevens’ early classic, Seven Swans,
with sparse yet vastly improved
instrumentation. Since his last
album five years ago, Stevens has
seen the passing of his estranged
mother – Carrie & Lowell recounts
this event, but isn’t defined by it. On
every of listen ‘Fourth of July’ I try
not to cry as Stevens whisper-sings
“We’re all gonna die”in conversation
with Carrie on her deathbed.
While not technically an
album, Product, a compilation of
a SOPHIE’s singles so far, is an
astonishingly bold effort for an
artist who has barely existed for
longer than two years. The fact that
it could easily be mistaken for a ‘best
of’ when it’s essentially everything
the electronic producer has ever
released speaks volumes about
SOPHIE’s work. He uses sounds in
weird and wonderful ways, creating
high-pitched, squeaky club bangers.
It might be too sweet for some, but
it’s worth it for that “fizzy feeling.”

I
f ‘I Know There’s Gonna Be
(Good Times)’ isn’t your song
of forever then you’ve certainly
haven’t had a good time this
year. I get into daily arguments
with my housemate over whether
‘Good Times’ or ‘Loud Places’ is
best song on In Colour. After years
of excessive steel pans, Jamie xx
delivers, with help from Young
Thug and Popcaan, one of the
greatest collaborations of the 21st
Century. As a side-note, for nearly
half a year I thought Popcaan was
talking about drinking Ka in his
intro, which resulted in a personal
obsession with the soft drink. A
few weeks ago, someone told me he
actually saying “cah.” Embarrassing.
The newly crowned king of hip-
hop, Kendrick Lamar, gave us one
this year’s best singles with ‘King
Kunta’, an empowering, hip track
that takes aim at “the power that be”
and maybe Drake too.“But a rapper
with a ghost writer? What the
fuck happened?” There’s no doubt
Kendrick is authentic. There’s so
much hidden meaning in his music,
and yet it still manages to be the
most funkalicious thing I’ve heard
this year.
With their follow up to critical
darling Lonerism, Tame Impala
crafted something that felt too
perfected. Currents doesn’t have
the same sort of raw psychedelia
as its predecessor, but it’s still
full of memorable singles. ‘Let It
Happen’opens the record with deep
lyrics, groovy hooks and a brilliant
electronic breakdown (for a minute
I thought my record player had
broken).
Until now, nothing The Weeknd
has released since his trilogy of
mixtapes in 2012 has particularly
excited me. ‘The Hills’ harks back
to Tesfaye’s earlier music; it’s a dark,
lustful and drug-induced. On the
other hand, ‘Can’t Feel My Face’ is
face-numbingly upbeat and full-
on pop. Comparisons to Michael
Jackson are apt. Amazingly, the two
singles have managed to rack up
around ¾ Billion views on YouTube.
Fucking memes. That’s really the
only reason I included Drake’s
‘Hotline Bling’ on this list. I guess
the beat’s pretty infectious too. I
don’t think anyone ever expected
Drake’s dance moves to break the
internet.The song has inspired some
pretty rad covers, including Erykah
Badu’s epic ‘Hotline Bling But U
Caint Use My Phone Mix’.
CALE TILFORD
aware that Holter is more present in
this album. She has never sounded
poppier; the track ‘Silhouette’builds
up around piano harmonies and
beautiful backing vocals, to reach
a haunting crescendo; ‘Everytime
Boots’ is a rag-time number, with a
riffs punctuated with poignant
impassioned vocals leave so much
space that every introduced line or
note has a real impact. If simple
guitar music is your thing look no
further than this album.

After two EPs and an LP, FKA
twigsreleasedM3LL155X,forgoing
previous naming conventions to
deliver a new, distinct sound. The
jaw-dropping release is seductive yet
self-doubting; on ‘Glass & Patreon’
she sings “Am I dancing sexy yet?”
But, it’s obvious Barnett doesn’t
need our approval. On ‘In Time’
she explores the universal desire for
change and growth in relationships:
“I will be better / And we will be
stronger.” We can only hope that
her next LP shows the same level of
growth.
