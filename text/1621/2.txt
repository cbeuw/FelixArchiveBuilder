limey,what a year it’s been.
For me, and presumably,
for you too. I can only
speak for me though, so I
will. It’s my editorial, mate. When I
woke up on New Year’s Day 2015,
I didn’t think I would still be at
Imperial by the end of it. I was due
to graduate, I certainly wasn’t up
for further, further education, and I
assumed I’d be spending Christmas
2015 on a houseboat in Berlin, just
working on my poetry or trying to
learn to code.
Alas, I am not on a boat. I’m not
in Berlin (most of the time). I’m sat
in a subterranean office in Beit – a
hall I was not cool enough to get
a room at in first year – living my
actual dream. I get paid to write a
newspaper for you lot.
There’s a theme at Imperial. We
arrive, we want to get the best out of
our time here, so we put our heads
down and work solidly for four
years.We are occasionally distracted
by general elections, rugby clubs
or giant desks, but apart from
that, we don’t pay much attention.
And FELIX is as guilty as anyone

for contributing to this narrative.
Imperial students do a tonne of
stuff. I should know, because it gets
sent to me every week,and I publish
it.
This week’s issue is a bumper
Christmas special, and if you
flick to the middle for your
beloved centrefold, you’ll find art,
photography, poetry and prose from
some of Imperial’s finest, in the
form of Phoenix. It’s beautiful, the
arts editors who put it together are
beautiful and don’t worry, there’s
still a tasteful nude of the swimming
and waterpolo teams on page 14.
Phoenix is a termly endeavour, so
give the arts editors a buzz if you
want in next year.
The art supplied for this issue
is just one way Imperial students
continue to display how freaking
cool they are. Where else would
you have physicists writing theatre
reviews, medics mulling over think
pieces and the programmers of
tomorrow coming out with pieces
so inflammatory,Owen Jones would
be jel? Loads of places, you might
respond. Nah mate, not like this.
Soppyeditorialsarenotmyjam,but
it’s due.I’m constantly astonished by
the quality of content that hits my
inbox, the time my section editors
dedicate to fine-tuning their work
and the general support I get from
a team of students who before the
summer holidays, I only knew from
stalking their Facebook profiles and
Twitter accounts. What a bunch.
Merry Christmas to you all, but
especially them.Thanks guys.

Letters (kinda)
In response to ‘Problematic yet
representative?’, Issue 1620
Dear Chief Editor,
In the 4th
of December edition of
FELIX,your music editor published
a piece criticizing the current Union
president’s political views and the
political apathy of the student
population. I wish to respond to
that article.
Iagreewiththeauthor’scontention
that, prima facie, some of the
president’s views are incendiary and
alienating. At Imperial College we
have much to appreciate, especially
the diversity of our student body.
Facile and defamatory comments
about the beliefs of fellow students
not only causes harm to the targeted
individual(s), but divides and
degrades the rich social tapestry
endowed upon us by this learned
institution. In this day and age, it is
too easy to disseminate thoughtless,
harmful comments via the Internet,
in this case blanket accusations of
treason against patriotic Scots.
Whilst one must decry ill-judged
comments whenever they appear,
I believe that the author has also
committed errors of judgement.It is
fair to question the impartiality of
the concerned individual given their
past comments, especially when
such comments would likely offend
several students. Nevertheless, the
author implies that this individual
is unqualified to perform her
duties as president on the basis of
her political beliefs. I have seen no
evidence to support this insinuation;
the overwhelming majority of
tweets by the account in question
promotes student engagement,
college outreach programs and
diversity, no less than what one
would expect. It seems that the
author wishes to decry an elitist vibe
in the president and hence sets her
up as an anathema of the student
body. In this country it is common
to succumb to class-based prejudice;
a rational person would not resort
to judging someone for their
socioeconomic status. Such conduct
is most primitive and unscientific,
undeserving of Imperial’s reputation
as a center of learning.
To add insult to injury, the
author concludes by lambasting
Imperial’s student population for
political stupor, subtly alluding
to the well-worn jibe of ICL
insulting UCL. Evidently Imperial
is less politically-active than other
universities, for the simple reason
that we are a technically-oriented
institution. Nevertheless, it is false
to say that we are apathetic about
our welfare and self-governance.
We care deeply. It’s just that at
the moment we’re simply too busy
with our coursework and studies to
wade into the bewildering world of
activism, rallies and power politics.
We shouldn’t let petty, polarizing
and introspective distractions
clutter our media. We should
however be discussing thorny
and uncomfortable issues, such
as addressing gender imbalances,
living conditions and profligacy
with our dear tuition fees. FELIX’s
investigations of these issues
and attempts to bring greater
transparency to the autocracy
imposed on us are much appreciated.
Kind regards,
Daniel Williams
