GHOSTS
Madalina Sas
The burning sunset is an orange
Harley Davidson
The Great American Freedom Machine
with an angel
riding into the horizon
on great wings
of ocean blue and the sand
on the beach
A gold that reminds him of
the great deserts of Arizona
The one
conquest that mattered
because it was an illusion
A mirage of the unforgiving heat
No thoughts required
Just promise to drive fast
He rides on
towards the elusiveness
He has no rear-view mirrors
because thereâ€™s nothing
behind him, anyway
The Great American Freedom Machine
