Directed by Liz Stevenson,
winner of the JMK award
recognising the best young directors
in the country, this production is
simple and energetic. The stage
is bare and positioned between
two wings of seating with rafters
above and behind the audience.
The actors thrive in the space and
their movement in and around the

Despite a slow first half, the
play hits a magnificent climax

Woke up this morning with
a terrific urge to lie in bed all day
and read. Fought against it for a minute.

Make the same unforgiveable mistakes?
Yes, given half a chance. Yes.
