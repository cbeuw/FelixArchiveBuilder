FELIX’s top four games of 2015

In videogames, the act of killing
is almost universally rewarded; yet,
in reality there is no worse crime
one can commit. There are many
games, particularly when stealth
is involved, where entirely pacifist
playthroughs are possible (although
this rarely beneficial to the player).
Undertale gives a certain humanity
to its enemies through humour and
charm. It doesn’t actively encourage
you to spare those you encounter,
but I’ve never felt worse murdering
something digitally before.
Tobyfox’s debut is a shining
gem in an endless stream of
unimaginative indie games and an
industry obsessed by open worlds.
By twisting JRPG mechanics, it’s
a game that feels instantly familiar
while still pushing the tired genre
forward. Other than the ability
to be merciful, Undertale will be
remembered for its hilariously sad
script and fourth-wall breaking
mechanics (this is a game which
could only work on PC). Even the
presentation of the game, from the
beautiful Earthbound-inspired
graphics to the genre-spanning
soundtrack, is flawless.
Undertale recognises that
understanding and compassion are
essential if we truly wish to resolve
conflicts - a message that is all
too obvious and yet so commonly
ignored.
Instead of trivialising death, it
makes it a core theme of the game.

Undertale
Metal Gear Solid V
Splatoon
Rocket League
A major complaint with the
Metal Gear Solid franchise has
always been that it relies too heavily
on drawn-out cutscenes and a
nonsensical plot.
Luckily, The Phantom Pain is
largely devoid of the problems that
plagued the series’ past, and as a
result Kojima has created arguably
his greatest game yet.
The Fulton surface-to-air recovery
system introduced is probably the
best innovation in a gaming this
year. Take someone (or something)
out non-lethally and you can attach
a balloon to their back to send them
to Mother Base, the central hub of
your operations.
Whether in Afghanistan or
Angola-Zaire, it’s incredibly
satisfying to quietly take out an
entire outpost of soldiers and then
have them all join your army as
researchers, medics or foot soldiers.
With each extra recruit, you really
feel like you’re making progress.
This is one of the many ways the
world feels incredibly reactive; each
small decision you make causes
a ripple, large or small. You can
approach each mission (or side-
mission) in seemingly infinite ways.
I can’t think of a single time where
I felt restricted by the tools available
to me, which is often the case even
in games labelled as open world
sandboxes.
The Phantom Pain is what all
future open-world games should
aspire to be: responsive, lifelike, and
beautifully rendered. Kojima, take a
bow.
Nintendo created one of the
greatest first-person shooters of all
time when they released Metroid
Prime for the GameCube in 2002.
However, since then people have
rarely associated Nintendo with
the genre. In 2015, with Splatoon
they innovate yet again, producing a
third-person shooter that attempts
to redefine what a competitive
shooter can be.
There is no death in Splatoon,only
the sudden explosion into a pile of
ink.The aim of the game is to cover
as much of the map in your team’s
colour. So, rather than being a game
about taking down the opposing
team, it’s more about taking control
of the map.Paint a surface with your
ink and you can turn into a squid
and swim through the map, vastly
increasing your speed.
This is certainly a game for all
ages; violence is nowhere to be
seen. In the absence of blood there
is nothing but paint and it’s all
the more fun for it. Maybe other
developers should take note.
At first, the game’s art style will
probably remind you of an awful
nineties cartoon. It’s Nintendo’s
weird attempt at trying to look
cool, but it seems to have succeeded.
Someone’s even made a whole zine
dedicated to the fashion in the game
and the weird half-human half-
squid hybrids that you play as. The
soundtrack is similarly ‘rad’ and like
all Nintendo games you’ll quickly
be humming along.
The only problem is that you’ll
have to buy a Wii U to play it.
Rocket League is the sequel to
Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-
Powered Battle-Cars, a name
which, while a bit of a mouthful, is
a fairly accurate description of both
games. It’s essentially a football
game, but with cars. Obviously, cars
don’t have feet so they couldn’t call
it that (although that doesn’t stop
Americans from misusing the term).
It’s miles better than both Fifa
and PES, two games which have
had years to evolve. Somehow, as a
car you feel more like you’re actually
playing football.There’s a large focus
on positioning and strategy, and
it’s certainly no good to just chase
the ball around. To save goals you
have to perform almost impossible
acrobatic maneuvers. You can
perform all sorts of tricks thanks to
the rocket boosters attached to your
car.You can even fly if you want, but
you’ll only embarrass yourself.
Developers, Psyonix, add another
layer of complexity by allowing you
to blow up your opponents if you
ram into them hard enough. So, just
when you’re about to score a goal
you can be temporarily taken out of
the game.
The thrill of speeding from one
end of the pitch to the other is unlike
anything I’ve ever experienced in a
sports game. If you thought Walcott
was fast, Rocket League will blow
you away. It’s refreshingly fast,
which often results in goals scored
seconds after the game starts.
This holiday, don’t ask for Fifa and
put Rocket League on your wish list
instead.
Because I couldn’t think of five
