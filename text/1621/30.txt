T
hanks to Terence Davies,
the idea of a Scottish epic
film will no longer be
intrinsically connected
to the thought of Mel Gibson
cavorting around the highlands in a
kilt; instead, it will conjure up the
image of Chris Guthrie, the central
character of Sunset Song, lying in a
field of wheat, thinking about what
the future could possibly hold for
her.
With life throwing a relentless
stream of abuse, grief, and death at
Guthrie,who wades through it all in
her quest for independence,it would
be easy for Davies to create a dour,
gloomy film; instead, what we have
in Sunset Song is an intense focus
on a landscape indifferent to the
trials of our hero, one that remains
pastorally bucolic in the face of
the evil of humanity. As Guthrie
repeatedly says throughout the film,
“nothing endures but the land,”
a line lifted from Lewis Grassic
Gibbon’s classic novel, adapted
masterfully by Davies for the film.
These spoken word interludes,
where we are granted access to the
workings of Guthrie’s mind, mark
off chapters of her sad life: the
death of her mother, who poisons
herself and her baby twins after
finding out she’s pregnant again; the
debilitating stroke that leaves her
dictatorial father bed-bound; being
made an orphan at the tender age of
18; her marriage to Ewan, cut short
by the inevitable announcement
of the commencement of WWI.
Sunset Song hits the audience again
and again with emotional turmoil,
flooring us with its power.
As Chris Guthrie, Agyness
Deyn is simply luminous; she is a
revelation. She brings to the role
a brute physical force, inhabiting
it completely; from the pains of
childbirth, to the blossoming effect
young love can bring, Deyn is
completely present in every single
scene. There may have been some
complaints about the veracity
of her accent (Sunset Song is set
in northeast Scotland; Deyn is
from Manchester), but for me the
pleasure of watching her on screen
came from the powerful nuance she
brought to the role; as we follow her
over the years, there is a real sense
of Guthrie coming out of her shell,
and seeing her develop and flower in
front of our eyes is a joy to watch.
Peter Mullan is terrifying as the
patriarch of the Guthrie household;
from the first time we see his face
loom into view, furrowed with
years of anger, we know things are
not going to end well. The effect
he has on his character is palpable,
and Mullan brings with him a
chilly atmosphere that immediately
sets us on edge. As Ewan, Kevin

As Chris
Guthrie,
Agyness
Deyn is
luminous;
she is quite
simply a
revelation
The epic tale Scotland deserves
Agyness Deyn shines in this luminous film from masterful director Terence Davies
Guthrie shows off his acting range,
starting out as a blushing lad who
can barely make eye contact with
Chris, before being transformed
into a man possessed by images
of trenches churning up the soil
of northern France, swallowing
comrades in a war orchestrated by
English generals.
Where the film really shines,
however,isinMichaelMcDonough’s
gorgeous cinematography, which
makes use of a multitude of lighting
conditions:seeing Guthrie bent over
a single candle, it’s like watching a
painting by the Dutch masters come
to life; a scene in church is flooded
with a seemingly righteous white
light, blinding the parishioners as
much as the pastor’s sermon on
cowardice and German sympathy;
multiple sweeping landscape shots
drink in the highlands of Scotland,
revealing more than a touch of
Terence Malick’s influence. It is
obvious that adapting the novel for
the big screen has been a labour
of love for Davies, and yet there
is the sense that perhaps he has
agonised too much about keeping
close to the source material. At 135
minutes long, the film is no short
watch, and yet an issue with pacing
means that characters and events
come and go like cars on motorway,
whizzing past us with enough force
to make us dizzy. This, combined
with Davies’ beautifully portentous
filming style, one that borders on
the laconic, means that the film has
the unusual quality of being both
too slow and too fast.
But still, the film would have to
go far to lose its charm. With a
stunning central turn from Agyness
Deyn – surely one to watch out
for in the future – and beautiful
camera-work throughout, Scotland
has finally received, in Sunset Song,
the film epic it so truly deserves.
Documentary corner: March of the Penguins
Ben Collier
Film Writer
S
o, the thinking behind the
segment on this final week
is that penguins equal snow,
and snow equals Christmas.
It’s a little tenuous but, to be honest,
it’s as good an excuse as any to
finally feature this film. Up there
with Disney’s Chimpanzee and
Attenborough’s LIFE television
series, March of the Penguins, a
French feature-length nature
documentary, is one of the most
famous of its kind. As the name
suggests, March of the Penguins
tells the story of the annual single-
file trek of the Antarctic Emperor
penguins towards their breeding
ground. Unlike many of their
winged relatives, penguins must
make their migrations (in this case,
over 70 miles) on foot. Morgan
Freeman narrates the journey as
the natural phenomenon unfolds,
and we are treated to classic and
memorable scenes of the penguins
protecting their soon-to-be new-
borns from the harsh cold of their
continent.
The film is not as light-hearted
as its posters and adverting may
lead you to believe. For a French-
directed/produced story there is
remarkably little romanticism or
sentimentality – the audience is left
to feel for the penguins through an
objective lens that showcases their
unique methods for survival with a
professional distance.
Unlike many other
nature documentaries – the
aforementioned Chimpanzee, for
example,is an offender in this regard
– anthropomorphism isn’t a staple
here. This, however, does not stop
the film from being an emotive and
genuinely beautiful in places. Some
of the scenes that the filmmakers
and cinematographers spent weeks
freezing in tents to capture are
wholly awe-inspiring.
The penguins themselves are
painted as almost a single organism.
The extreme conditions of their
environment mean that they must
put the interests of one another
above selfish individuality; without
this comradery the penguins could
not survive. In this way one begins
to appreciate the razor-sharp
honing these birds have undergone
in order to perfect their survival
tactics over a vast number of years.
However, a focus on the individual
is key for the narrative here and at
times, drama on the individual level
is the focus with the ‘whole’ merely
providing a back-drop. Penguins
practice monogamy, which entails
them mating and caring for their
offspring with only one other, and
this aspect of caring parenthood is
one of the only times the objective
lens of the documentary is allowed
to be lifted.
The pacing of the movie is the
key to its success. As a viewer, one
is easily able to lose themselves in
the shot-by-shot flow of the story.
An excellent rhythm is set up as
we cut from group to individual,
experiencing all the highs and
lows of these animals’ time-old
expedition.
As a nature-loving biologist my
opinion may be biased but I cannot
praise this film and the team behind
it enough. March of the Penguins
is the first of the documentaries
covered in this section which I
cannot see anyone not enjoying at
least to some extent.

A
relentlessly bleak
morality tale from
Bulgaria, The Lesson
starts off immediately
by showing us the upright character
of our antagonist, Nade (Margita
Gosheva), a secondary school
teacher with a troublemaking thief
in her class.
I
n an effort to enforce the
seriousness of stealing, she
gives them the chance to
return the money in secret,
threatens to report them to the
police, and even has everyone in the
class chip in to replace the stolen
money, investing their interests
in catching the thief. But her
professionally stern attitude towards
right and wrong is in direct conflict
with Nade’s personal life, which is
rapidly spiralling out of control.
Upon returning home one day,
she finds bailiffs ready to repossess
the house; it turns out that her
husband (Ivan Barnev) has been
spending the money ring-fenced for
mortgage repayments on restoring a
camper-van, and Nade must resort
to a crooked loan-shark in order to
save the house.
Like the Dardenne brothers’
excellent Two Days, One Night, this
is a damning exploration of the
pressures debts can place on the
individual. Nade is constantly living
under a burden, one that – as we see
by the ending of the film – cannot
be scrubbed completely from her
conscience.
This life, one of crushing debt, is
a regular occurrence in a world still
bleeding from the financial crisis,
and directors Kristina Grozeva and
Petar Valchanov do well to follow
the extraordinary twists and turns
of such a mundane happening.
There are dramatic moments in
The Lesson that feel more taut than
any recent thriller, and instances of
injustice that sting more than those
found in political dramas. This is
a film that revels in the minutiae
of everyday oppression, of bank
transfer charges and washing up
left undone; Gosheva is magnetic
as Nade, imbuing the role with a
near-autistic sense of justice that is
steadily eroded over the film’s 105
minutes, which just fly by.

are initially left largely implied
(an old photograph of her dead
mother; her smelling her husband
to detect fumes of alcohol), and
while things are brought to light
in a spectacular argument between
Nade and her father’s new chakra-
loving girlfriend, on the whole the
film – like Gosheva herself – keeps
its cards close to its chest.
Shot in a naturalistic style, with
astute use of natural light, and a
largely-bleary colour palate of muted
grey tones,The Lesson is an audacious
piece of filmmaking; it lifts the lid
on the grimy world of personal debt
that underpins society, forcing us
to watch until uncomfortable, and
further still.Grozeva and Valchanov
are bringing a sense of European
neorealism to the Balkans; I cannot
wait to see what they do next.
