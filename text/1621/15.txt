The Phoenix 5 winter 2015
You’ve picked me despite the fact that there is a cheaper
bottle
of red just to my left. Very impressive. I do come from
better climes: my Alta grapes are much better any shoddy
old Merlot.
At least you haven’t gone for Lambrini. I doubt anyone
will notice at pre-drinks either way, but I promise
I’ll be a good shout until you get three glasses in and
realise that perhaps
you’re not quite the heavy-weight you claimed to be at the
Mingle yesterday
and that 18% alcohol content is actually pretty good bang
for your bottle.
Don’t worry - what’s one missed 9AM lecture between freshers?
I’m sure you didn’t need to be
in that fire safety briefing anyway.

At first you’re a lamb, with shak-
ing legs and wide eyes, surrounded by
wolves. You long to join the pack. So
you get slaughtered on your first Sat-
urday night away from home and wind
up as fresh meat. Soon you’ll be a
rotting carcass, like those who have
gone before you. You’ll waltz up to
the chopping block for the final blow,
the last hurrah, and the sharp knife
of reality in the form of “careers ad-
vice” will come crashing down, slicing
the last shreds of freedom away.
Stay a lamb as long as you can.
Biochemistry, Year 2.
