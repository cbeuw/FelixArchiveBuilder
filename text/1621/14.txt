The Phoenix 3 winter 2015
And so we have reached that time of year again. It’s cold and wet outside, the Christmas music is into its third
month, everyone is bored of their course and the Felix Arts team have forgotten about their work. Nothing ever
changes… Instead of working, we’ve stuffed this week’s paper with the best and brightest work the Imperial Arts
scene can offer. The best in photography, poetry, art and creative writing, Phoenix shows off the work we don’t
usually get to see, and we love it!
We’ve picked what we like and we hope you like it too. Thanks to all our amazing contributors and of course to our
wonderful boss Grace without whom we probably would still be thinking this was due next week (there isn’t an issue
next week…) Thanks also to Fred for his advice and layout skills and Aifric Campbell for offering us the vast works
of his creative writing course.
If we’ve not published your work this time we’ll definitely consider you for the spring edition, and if you didn’t
submit any work, please do! We’re happy to have your submissions anytime and we’re already looking forward to
prepping the next issue of Phoenix. Send your work to arts.felix@ic.ac.uk and be part of the fun!
Jingjie, Max and Indira
