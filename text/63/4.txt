Sir,
As the reprsentative of I.C. Union on the U.L.U.
President's Council, I f e e l I should make seme comment
on the recent action of U.C. Union, reported i n the
"Sennet".
The reasons given f o r their action appear to he
based on three misinterpretations of the P r i n c i p a l at
t a l k with President's Council on May 3rd., plus d i s s a t i s -
faction at not being able to get t h e i r own way over the
card vote.
These thr-e mistakes are:
a) The P r i n c i p a l d i d not state that "no amendments
to the present U.L.U. constitution would be allowed f o r
an indefinite period". In fact he said that i n view of
the youth of the new U.L.U. constitution (drawi up i n
1952), i t did not seem advisable to pass major amend-
ments at present.
b) With regard to the new Union building, the
P r i n c i p a l f e l t that the responsibility f o r the £20,000
p.a. needed to run i t was too great f o r an a l l student
body, but that the use made by students of the f a c i l i t i e s
provided by the new building would be controlled entirely
by students. This i s exactly the system i n operation
at I.C. which seems to work admirably.
o) U.C. Union Council seems to f e e l that the new
U.L. Union building i s being erected at the expense of
adoiticn to U.C. Union's admittedly inadequate premises.
In fact, the money allocated by the U.C.C. to University
College f o r building purposes has not been affecr ed. Use
made of t h i s money i s a matter f o r the U.C. authorities,
'j The I.C. Union Council rejected the idea of a card
• vote on President's Council as they believed that the
role of a president on t h i s Council i s that of an
expert representative rather than that of a mandated
delegate. He has a duty to preserve the interests of
his own Union but an equal duty to help the University,
of which the small-r colleges are i n general the more
active members.
The new building i n llalet Street i s intended to
be complementary to the f a c i l i t i e s of the individual
Unions.
We, as one of the larger and more fortunate
colleges, may not appear to gain much from the University
Union except on the a t h l e t i c side, but I am convinced
that I.C.Union has a great deal to offer U.L.U. and i n
so doing w i l l derive the benefits to be obtained from
being a member of a great and flourishing University
Union.
Tours etc.,

Dear S i r ,
During the last few days we, i n London, have vdtnessed
some magnificent and very moving pageantry; i t i s not
just a t r a d i t i o n a l show-off: i t i s not just an extravagant
expenditure of government taxes: i t i s neither conceit
nor any other of our human vices; i t is.something very
much deeper, which although we have t r i e d we have been
unable to put into words.
Although dwarfed by the majestic homecoming of our
gracious Queen we witnessed two other events at the Albert
H a l l laat week - the Boys' Brigade Meeting with the uni-
forms and bands - the University Presentation Ceremony
with the t r a d i t i o n a l mortar boards and academic gowns.

When as freshmen we arrived at I.C. as i t i s at
present, we noticed very l i t t l e characteristic change
from school l i f e except perhaps that we are a l l somewhat
older. When as freshmen we arrive at I.C. as i t w i l l
be, Just one of 3,000 other students, we s h a l l f i n d i t
s t i l l more d i f f i c u l t to take f u l l advantage of anything
that a University has to offer, except those precious
l e t t e r s after our names.
Let's attempt a Walter M i t t y f o r a while.' Imagine
arriving on that f i r s t day at college to he welcomed by
students clad i n academic gowns - the centuries old trade-
mark of scholars and students; when we i n turn eventu-
a l l y complete our f i r s t year we too would spend some s i x
or seven s h i l l i n g s and proudly wear our own gowns. We
could distinguish the freshmen by t h e i r "academic naked-
ness" ; we could distinguish scholars, post graduates and
staff by the type of gown; we should even be able to r e -
cognise guildsmen, miners or s c i e n t i s t s .
A large number of students wear college scarves
which indicates that some of us' at least are proud to be
recognised as students; pride i s no s i n - within reason
i t i s a very excellent characteristic. Academic gowns
are more individual than scarves or blazers and would
prevent us simulating a crumb i n a tiered wedding cake
(for such v/e hope w i l l be the elegance of the new "expan-
sion" buildings); gowns are dignified, t r a d i t i o n a l , inex-
pensive and very p r a c t i c a l - at one school i t was recently
suggested that masters should no longer wear gowns; the
idea was promptly dismissed on the grounds that the
absence of the gown would inc\irr too much expense on clothes
t a i l o r i n g and valeting." We would be expected to wear
gowns within the college but not necessarily outside i t s
precincts; gowns would be worn at mealtimes (whichwould
undoubtedly improve the dubious table manners we so often
have t o abide), at meetings and we could always hang them
up whilst labouring over f i l e s and d r i l l s i n the work-
shop.
Perhaps, s i r , we have imposed on your column too aneh,
with these our w i s t f u l hopes; but why should we NOT wear
academic gowns?
Yours sincerely,
Dear S i r , . E
