Last Saturday, I.C. Cross-oountry Club sent three
teams down South to run i n an i n v i t a t i o n point-to-point
organised by the Brighton and Storrington Foot Beatles.
1.0. first team, oomposed of Pain (3rd), Huxford (4th)
Bowler (6th) and Dearden (7th) took the team trophy, but
the most interesting performance from the point of view
of this paper was that of a team oomposed e n t i r e l y of
"Felix" men. This new Journalistic venture as conceived
by the Sdltor himself, who distinguished h i a s e l f by being
the only member of t h i s team to t r a i n at a l l seriously f o r
the event. However, of the four team members, Mr
Starmer was lying fourth at the half-way mark. Previously
at the f i r s t water-jump, Geoff Grimshaw, Coming Events
fiditor, who had l e d the four up to that point, entered
the mid, and came out minus a shoe. At t h i s juncture,
he was heard by Doug. Inmen, R.C.S. Salesman, just over-
taking, to remark: "xxxxxxx.1
". Meanwhile, B i l l Hudson,
Circulation manager, and Geoff. Starmer were having a
tussle between themselves and a Brighton A.C. runner.
This was eventually won by B i l l , whose indignantly b r i s t l -
ing face-foliage must have thoroughly cowed the opposition.
F e l i x came fourth, there being only one other team
running besides the I.C. three. We are looking forward
to further such progressive j o u r n a l i s t i c enterprises, and
a Felix XT may shortly be seen at Lords.

In the University championships held l a s t Friday and
Saturday I.C. shared f i r s t place -Jith University College
and Battersea, each gaining 20 points. This i s the
first time I.C. has been i n the f i r s t place i n t h i s
competition and the first time there has been a t r i p l e
tie. I t was a credi+Vble performance by the team of
eight entered.
I.C.-
s p r i n c i p a l hope i n the individual event was-
Brian Manley, swimming i n the 100 yds. backstroke.
Be was narrowly beaten into second place by Mike Clark,
the U.L. president, the two being old r i v a l s . Our only
other place wan gained by Gordon Stewart i n the 100
yds. B u t t e r f l y . Points were, however, w e l l divided
between a number of the clubs competing, as i s usual i n
the U.L. championships with so many colleges, and i t re-
mained for the two team races, which counted doable
points, to decide the competition. I.C."s team,of
Maaley, Stewart, Lampard, and MoChesney, gained f i r s t
place i n the Medley 1"slay, and i n the Freestyle team race
the same teas w4t8» Hay f o r Lampard surprised U.C. and
Battersea by beating both and gaining f i r s t place.

At Chiswiok Bsgattaton Saturday May 15th., I.C. were
represented by the f i r s t and second eights entered i n
the Thames Cop and Junior-Senior events. Containing two
new men, the second eight met London, t h e i r opponents of-
the previous week, i n the f i r s t heat. Holding London very
well off at the start by s t r i k i n g 40, they kept l e v e l

With a substitute rowing i n the orew, the f i r s t eight

"Pairs of I.C.W.S.C. of varying degrees of talent
once more performed at Motspur Park i n the U.L. Champion-
ships. A f t e r stimulating competition with Wye and King's
Colleges we acquired the Sherwood Factor Cup leaving them
to share the Challenge Cup as a consolation prize. - The
Cup was suitably re-christened with alcohol provided by
Dr. John Harding and the surviving members of the team
spent the evening elsewhere.
Union members may wonder what stimulates the women to
such f e v e r i s h a c t i v i t y at t h i s time of year. The answer
may be seen on Monday ( l 7 t h ) when Miss Sherwood takes
the victorious team out to dinner.
To show that we r e a l l y earned the Cup, the following

I.C.W.S.C. excelled i t s e l f , by beating L.S.E. in the
f i r s t round of the University championship on Saturday,
May 15th. The score was 6-3 despite the fact that t h i *
team had had l i t t l e practice and that i t was the morning
a f t e r the Silwood dance,

The f i r s t XI have started the season rather poorly.
However, the team contains a wealth of potential talent
and i t i s to be hoped that t h i s w i l l soon reveal i t s e l f
In the f i r s t match against Reading University, I.C.
batted f i r s t on a perfect wicket, but were dismissed for
142. Only Hanmaton, Heam and Kitchener scored more
than 20, and Reading duly won i n a canter.
I.C. dismissed Hillingdon f o r 158 but again batted
poorly and could amass a mere 110. Against Old Sinjuns
some excellent bowling by Jordinson (6 frr 23), w e l l
supported by Brown and Ault, put I.C. i n a dominating
position, requireing only 100 to win. But the batting •
reached a new minimum. F i n a l l y wanting three to win i n
the last two overs with the l a s t man i n , I.C. could only
manage a pathetic draw at 98 f o r 9. "itchen made 31 but
received only spasmodic support.
By f a r the best performance was against a good
Wembliy team who were dismissed f o r 158 by some f i n ,
aggressive bowling by Brown (7 f o r 57) and good f i e l d i n g .
Rain then put an end to proceedings.
When the batsmen show more confidence and aggression
t h i s team i s capable oi' great things.
The Sunday XI scored a win over Baygreen, thanks
mainly to a fine f i f t y by Dr. R.T. Severn, who thus en-
dangered h i s plaoe i n the side as i t i s w e l l known that
he performs t h i s feat only once annually. The all-Welsh
fast opening attack of Brown and Weale proved very e f f -
ective and Weale h i t the stumps at least once. In the
next match some new blood i s being introduced i n the shape
of D. K. Nicholas (Ph. D., posthumously) and t h i s should
have.some effect.

S.M.C. 1st and 2nd VI's suffered heavy defeats at
the hands of I.C. on Wednesday May 5th. The barometer
showed "Wet and Windy" and that i s also a f a i r comment oa
the tennis. S.M.C. proved to be remarkably f i t but
both t h e i r teams ware depleted due to the absence of 1st
year students on School Practice.
I.C.,1st VI too were below strength against Reading
as four I.C. men were representing the University at
Birmingham.
The I.C. staff produced f i v e men and a lady f o r the
match on Saturday May 15th. I t i s considered l i k e l y that
the lady's presence inspired the students and distracted
the attention of the staff. D.H. de G. Allen's game
anyway was very "relaxed"
