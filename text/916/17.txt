Figaro's Wedding
O p e r a is not d u l l or
incomprehensible at the E N O .
Every performance is in English,
the language spoken by the people,
rather than that f o u n d i n
dictionaries. H o l l y w o o d isn't a
patch on the real thing. They've got
love stories, rampant orgies and
plenty of carnal sins that would be
banned on T V . Figaro's Wedding
has got the lot. Its a comic tale of
love, lust, deceit and jealousy,
forcing the players to w o r m
themselves out of the most awkward
of situations. H o w would you, a
reputable Countess, reply to you're
insanely jealous, if untrue, husband
demands entry whilst you are busy
dressing a lustful page-boy as a
woman to seduce him?
This specially commissioned
adaptation o f M o z a r t ' s The
Marriage of Figaro is the first new
production of the season, and worth
the wait. J e r e m y S a m s has
compacted the epic into a mere
three hours of side-splitting bliss.
This version could just as well be
the original, with the sumptuous use
of expletives, 'That bastard Figaro!'
for one, and observation. W h e n
propositioned, Figaro's wife replies
' W o m e n of my class don't get
headaches.'
T h e sets are shocking and add to
the vivid audacity of the characters,
all in period costume. T h e opera is
borne o f an age of the idle
aristocracy who, bored of their
partners, indulge in charade and
seduction of their lessers and peers.
Figaro, the Count's manservant, is
due to wed his beloved Susanna, the
Countess' maid. T h e Count is far
happier to continue to seduce
Susanna and let his frumpish house-
keeper marry Figaro to repay an
unpaid loan. A s the Countess and
Susanna learn of the Count's intents
to thwart their happiness and
continue to betray his wife, they
contrive a series of deceptions to
humiliate the Count and dampen

Figaro's jealousy. The assumptions
and defences become more absurd
until the whole leaves you cringing
as if it were the Fawlty Towers of
1786. ; „
The orchestra, conducted by Paul
Daniel, played precisely, if a little
racy, but that reflects the action.
B r y n Terfil provided a vast Figaro
against Cathryn Pope's quick-witted
Susanna. However, it was Anthony
Michaels-Moore and Joan Rodgers
as the C o u n t and C o u n t e s s
A l m a v i v a who took the show with
faultless portrayals of scheming and
envy.
Figaro's Wedding runs at the
L o n d o n C o l i s e u m until 19
December. Tickets are priced from
£6.50 but reduced price tickets are
available from 10am on the day of
the performance at only £4. Its
cheaper than the cinema and far
m o r e e n t e r t a i n i n g . E v e r y
performance is unique and a comic
spectacle well worth a visit.
