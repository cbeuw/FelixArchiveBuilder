Enterprise '91
Careers Fair
Student Exchange
Register (SER)
You may be aware of the increased
levels of graduate employment at
the moment.
There is an important careers
event which you might well wish to
visit. T h e Enterprise '91 Careers
Fair is being held in Oxford on
Tuesday 12th and Wednesday 13th
November. A r o u n d fifty major
i n d u s t r i a l c o m p a n i e s are
participating including G l a x o ,
G r a n d M e t r o p o l i t a n , B N F L ,
Albright and W i l s o n , Thames
Water, British Rail and many
others. For finalists it is an excellent
opportunity to have a first option on
some of Europe's most exciting
careers and for non-finalists there
are over 500 vacation jobs available
at the event.
The organisers are providing free
coach transport to the exhibition.
The coaches will leave Imperial
from under the archway in Prince
Consort Road on Wednesday 13th
November at 1.30pm. T h e coaches
will depart from Oxford at around
5.00pm in the evening. If you want
to go simply raise your hand now
so that I can count the numbers. If
. you do put up your hand, a seat will
be reserved for you on the coach so
make sure you turn up!
Trondheim
International Student Festival in
Trondheim is a festival for students
arranged by students. In doing so
we hope to give the participants a
better understanding of other
cultures and people, and of course
some memorable days in Norway.
W e would like to point out that we
are inviting students, not their
organisations.
I S F i T - 9 2 would like to invite
students from your school to the
festival. If you have any questions
please contact Zoe Hellinger in the
Union Office or write to University
of T r o n d h e i m , 7034 Trondheim,
Norway.
The Radio 4 programme ' M o n e y
B o x ' recently featured a scheme
w h i c h c a n p r o v i d e cost-free
accommodation for students. Here
is an example of how it works:
Student ' A ' vacates a room in his
family home in a University town,
to study at Art College 200 miles
away.
Student ' B ' lives near the A r t
College and has chosen to go to the
University in the town where ' A '
lives.
Both students have registered
with S E R and will be sent each
others' address. They can excahgne
rooms for one term or for the
duration of their course and save all
rent charges.
Since the broadcast, the response
has been very good—we have been
asked by Admissions' Tutors to
provide registration forms for
distribution to U C C A candidates.
W e hope to be included in the
U C C A Handbook for 1993, and
although the sceme was set up for
new entrants, we have had enquiries
fromexisting students, and will be
happy to take them onto the
Register.
The fee for our service is £25.
For a copy of our brochure and
registration form please send a
Stamped Addressed Envelope to:
SER. 69 H i g h Street, Needham
Market, Suffolk. 1P6 8 A N .
