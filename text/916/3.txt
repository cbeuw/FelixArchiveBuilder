The The Usual Rant
College Day
Dear Adam,
Is it an annual event or is it just
coincidence that the proposals to
lengthen the college day are still
with us?
I was under the (obviously
misguided) impression that after
several working parties, reports,
meetings, discussion documents etc
the proposals had been shelved; yet
they are again, reincarnated.
It should be pretty obvious by
now to all concerned that the
students (not that they count for
much, of course) are not exactly in
favour of the lengthening. Unless
they know different, that is. D o the
lecturers want a longer day?
Perhaps the Research groups do,
although most of the populace of the
college, except the undergraduates,
work long hours in college anyway.
T h e undergraduates work long
hours out of college.
A l l o w i n g two hours each night
for study, that takes the proposed
working week to 50 hours. F o r a
'job' that pays £3000 a year, anyone
else would be out on strike.
Then there is the rush hour.
Travelling home in that every night
means that, in my case, I can expect
to get to sit down at about 8.30pm,
by the time I have travelled and
eaten. I would get the chance to
meet some new friends on the tube
as I stare at their armpits.
Is there a silent (or not so silent)
majority at IC that wants a longer
working day, or is this an attempt
by College to do what they want to,
irrespective of what its members
wish?
Yours,

Dear Adam,
Since I haven't heard from the
Christian U n i o n about the farce we
call the C of E , I will leave this
subject, if only to resurrect it again
at a later date. (Pun deliberately
intended).
Since my last letter a more
pressing issue has come to light.
That of the meddling Eurocrats.
These unelected commissioners and
two bit politicians love barking
Britain at every opportunity. Yet
when it comes to the French
farmers burning our sheep because
they can't stand a little competition,
they keep not surprisingly quiet.
Every day in every way our
soveriegnty and nationhood are
being slowly eroded. What's worse
is we have a P M who, I am afraid,
seems to be willing to let this
happen. I didn't agree with his
predecessor on everything, but at
least she would never have let the
situation continue. M r Major just
doesn't have the backbone to stand
up to the Federalists (not that
Kinnock would be any different).
M r Major must realise the British
people do not wish to be ruled from
Brussels or Strasbourg (even Jaques
Delors can't decide on the H Q ) .
E v e n our adverts are under
Dear Editor,
Having completed our degrees at
Imperial College in June, we were
all looking forward to October 24th,
more for the Commemoration Ball
than the graduation ceremony itself.
F o r many of us this was a last
chance to see old friends, so we all
agreed to try to get tickets for this
special event.
T h e first half of the evening the
Natural History M u s e u m lived up
to expectations, as both setting and
atmosphere suited the occasion. W e
then, however, transferred to the
U n i o n Building, (not Sherfield, as
advertised), where the majority of
us met with hostility from those
staff manning the door. They
seemed more interested in taking £2
from students who appeared to be
arriving purely for the bar extension
than in allowing those of us who
had paid £85 inside the building.
Ball tickets were demanded, but
would you go to the trouble of
threat, Hamlet ads are gone and
soon, we hear, we will see the
demise of the G o l d Blend couple
flirting with each other (unless they
can prove it really has a 'richer
s m o o t h e r f l a v o u r ' ) . I ' m not
kidding! E v e n C a r l s b e r g and
Heineken ads face the chop on
health grounds; and after thirty
years the children's favourite
' M i l k y Bar K i d ' could also be
banned if it continues to say it
makes him 'strong and tough'.
(This poor little guy has been under
fire a lot lately. During the Summer
it was said he was racist because a
black child could not play his part.
But, imagine the outrage the
Commission for Racial Equality
would express if they used a black
child and advertised h i m as the
'Chocolate Coloured K i d ' . )
That aside, John Major should go
to the Maastricht Conference
prepared to say no to monetary
union, no to a federal state and no
to a c o m m o n foreign policy. Y o u
only have to look at the pathetic and
lilly-livered response to the G u l f
W a r to show how much a farce that
would be.
It is about t i m e the E C
Commissioners treated Britain with
the same respect as they treat at
wearing a ballgown/DJ to avoid
paying £2 for a disco?
The excitement then really began
when trying to fight one's way
through to the bar, only to be met
by a five-deep wall of people
waiting to be served. The inevitable
crush meant many people in formal
dress decided that the need for a
drink (quite considerable by this
time!) was not worth the risk to
expensive clothing from spilt drinks
and cigarettes. O n eventually
meeting up with our group of
friends in the crush, it was to find
that many had already left or were
on the point of doing so.
The sense of occasion was finally
destroyed on finding the Ents disco,
which was at least the same as it had
been for the last three
y e a r s — C R A P !
It also occurred to many of us
who have been working in the
licensing trade that a bar extension
for the Commemoration Ball should
least the French who are the poodle
of the dominant Germans.
Unfortunately, I fear, the P M and
Douglas H u r d will not argue our
case and will lead us on the road to
economic and monetary union.
Yours always,
Alan Bailey.
PS. After last week's articles from
the Third World First and Amnesty,
may I suggest the new name for
Felix as 'The Guardian' or even
' M a r x i s m T o d a y ' ?
I am not sure that the
readership really want to know
your opinions on matters which
are so obviously above your
intellectual capability. I get the
impression that you are trying to
cause debate, of which I
wholeheartedly approve, but it is
done in such a ridiculously O T T
manner and displays such
stunning ignorance of any issues
involved that nobody would even
try to respond. This is a misuse
of free speech - please try to do
it better; it is merely a tedious
rant at the moment.
-Adam.
only have been used by those
attending the ball, and not to any IC
student willing to pay £2. Instead
it w o u l d h a v e been m o r e
appropriate if the disco invitation
had been e x t e n d e d to those
participating in the graduation
ceremony, who were unable to
obtain, or could not afford tickets
for the earlier part of the evening.
It would have been nice, i f
somewhat surprising, of the U n i o n
Executive to remember that the
Commemoration Ball is a special
night, being the culmination o f 3/4
years hard work. This was certainly
reflected in the £85 ticket price.
Ultimately, the ball was 'a night to
r e m e m b e r ' , as p r o m i s e d , but
unfortunately not for the right
reasons.
Yours disappointedly,
C Poole, C Masters, N Male,
J Phillips, G Andrade,
K Crawley.
