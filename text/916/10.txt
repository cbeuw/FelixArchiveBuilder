Mel Who?
Australia of the near future: M e l
Gibson hits the highway (hard!) in
this, the first of the Mad Max
trilogy, pursuing nomad bikers (not
a nice bunch) all over the outback
(and not a roo in sight). Getting a
bit cheesed off with being outrun he
gets his mechanic pal to knock him
up a souped up T r a n s - A m with an
air intake that would surely need a
periscope to see over.
Unfortunately for his wife and
kid, his increased success rate
annoys the bikers just a wee bit.
Thus they seek vengeance for those
of their number that have come off
worse when tangling with out
leather clad hero. A l l in all this is
a pretty cool film with it's fair share
of action (ie violence).
It also explains the hardened M a x
that we see in the sequel(s). O f the
three films making up the trilogy,
this is the one to see, followed of
course by M a d max II (if/when we
show it!).
If you want to join the I C S F and
want to see this or any other film
then refer to last weeks issue of
Felix for details.

Little did you know what you were
missing this weekend... M a y b e
you'll regret the fact that you didn't
tag along... What was so special
about these few days then, you say?
W e l l , we kept ourselves amused
in a variety of ways. T h e blanket
game...images spring to mind.
Hours in the bar were extremely
educational for those alcoholics
amongst us. A s for getting changed
in the woods, why weren't we told
about the public toilets a few yards
up the road? It would have saved us
from all those brambles. I'm sure
the people who walked past thought
we were quite bizarre. A n y w a y ,
they just pretended we weren't
there.
P r o g r e s s i n g o n to m o r e
interesting matters. Steve, didn't
you realise we could hear every
single word? What a shame you
c o u l d n ' t hear o u r j u i c y
conversations! What, you want us
to speak up? W e l l , perhaps, next
time, you should have your glasses
poised. B y the way, who was it who
ended up snogging Phil?
E v e n though the reception of the
radio was hopeless, we had music
throughout our travels. The front of
the van provided us with a few
tunes. But a bit of advice, perhaps
you should develop your repertoire.
I think we know those tunes well
enough now: well, your versions
anyway.
So, what about the boardsailing?
Unfortunately, there was not much
wind. Therefore, we probably got
the most exercise swimming about
in freezing cold water and jumping
from board to board.
W e had a great time despite all
of this. T h e next weekend trip
p r o m i s e s to be e v e n m o r e
interesting. W i l l we be able to do
more windsurfing, or will we just
have to change into the surfing
club?
