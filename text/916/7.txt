Last Sunday IC Rag returned to
Covent Garden Market and once
again set about mugging tourists
with a gentle smile, a swift tongue
and an even swifter Rag can. Due
to the fact that a few vintage
vehicles and a bundle of interested
people had headed to Brighton for
the day, the turn out was low. This
however did not stop a team of three
t a k i n g £564.03 f o r M u l t i p l e
S c l e r o s i s (a m u s c l e w a s t i n g
disease).
T h e collectors, N i c k A l l e n who
took £198.61, David ' W o m b l e '
W o o d c o c k who took £184.68, and
Tamsin Braisher who took £180.74
all put in great effort on the day, an
effort which is reflected in their
totals. This means that T a m s i n , IC
Rag's current top collector, has now
taken over £1,000 and Rag W e e k
hasn't even started yet.
Congratulations and thanks to all
three, especially Tamsin, even 'if
she didn't recognise W i l l Carling
when she took some money off of
him.
O n Saturday we have what can
only be regarded as two easy
collections. Neither are going to
raise thousands, but they are
enjoyable and are ideal for those
that like collecting but find it
difficult. Y o u won't necessarily
raise a lot, but what you do raise
will be raised with ease.
First there's the Poppy D a y
collection in Maidstone. W e leave
at about 8.30am so that we can get
to Maidstone by the time it gets
busy. Collecting with Poppies is
easy. There's none of this rushing
up to people and asking them for a
donation, you just stand there and
people come and put money in your
tin in exchange for a poppy.
W e then head back just after
lunch, when it starts to get slack,
in time for the Leukaemia Research
Pub C r a w l . W e ' l l be starting from
the U n i o n Building at 4.00pm, so
if you don't fancy coming to
Maidstone you can join us then. It's
a tour of the pubs in and around
South K e n . and is an excellent
chance to get to know them, if you
haven't already. If you wish to start
later you can still turn up at the
U n i o n and L R will give you a
collecting can and a list of pubs.
T h e rest is up to you. Collecting in
pubs however is also easy. A
captive audience in a relaxed social
atmosphere. It's easy, fun and
above all sociable. Join us.
