This Picture

I'm not going to waste time with an
introduction to this band. If you
don't know them by now, then you
obviously have reading difficulties,
ie, you don't know how to. Yes,
I've been waiting for this, one of the
world's best bands new album
(mind you, I am biased). I a m also
allowed, Editor W i l l i n g , to convey
emotion in extreme invective
( T h a n k s , A d a m ) w h i c h is,
incidentally, the only apropos of
Cathal Coughlan and his not-so-
merry men.
T h e album opens with 'Behind the
M o o n ' , a languid acoustic strum
elegantly trickling through anger,
inadequacy and all resultant abuses-
'She says ' G o ' , meaning 'Stay',
meaning ' Y o u have to p a y " .
Cathal's passion is imbued in the
lovely pianissimo arrangements like
Elvis Costello playing Donald
Fagen, or vice versa, and this
continues in the title track; an
embittered tale of a young Irishman
disillusioned and misunderstood in r
'freakshow Britain'. It could almost
be autobiographical, but there's no
time here for reflection. If you
thought 'Blues for Ceausescu' was
E n g l a n d , M o n a r c h y ,
d y n a s t y / n e p o t i s m v i c i o u s l y
castrated by men with guitars for
shears, the bastard rewrite of
R . E . M . ' s 'Shiny Happy People' is
the coup de grace, a vibrator
wrapped in barbed wire and stuffed
up ' T h e well-spanked arses of the
closet queens who make it a crime
to be gay'. Both quality and quantity
of venom are unbelievable as lines
like ' Y o u look like the type who
likes to suck a big pipe' and ' F u c k
you, Showbusiness' are spat out.
A n d this is all over a manic hip-hop
beat and a wizened warble of
R . E . M . ' s chorus. Y o u want to see
the corpse of some grinning witch-
hag from her wholly undeserved
rest in ' M a r i o Vargas Y o n i ' .
A n d so, as the end approaches
through the unrestrained beauty of
' L o n g About N o w ' and ' T h e Great
Valerio' (both cover versions), the
great pop icon/iconoclast Cathal
Coughlan emerges as a blazing
those famous faces blush like their
w e l l - s p a n k e d arses? P h o n e
Kitchenware Records and get them
to release this as a single.
Before long, ' T h e Mother of the
nation' with her ' M o n k e y shit
brown hair- rinse' is exhumed like
embodiment of my two faves,
Public Image Limited and Steely
D a n . H e walks arm in arm with
beauty and hatred w h i l e he
recharges M y sense of both. Let us
not forget, anger is an energy.
D a v i d .
T h e lead singer of This Picture is
like a whirling dervish, like a
hyperactive T i m Booth, his arms
flailing, and his bare feet leaping
and bounding across the stage. I
think it's called presence. Whatever
it is, he's got it.
Three weeks back, Pebbles said that
the lyrics, and I quote, 'make about
as much sense as a parrot on speed.'
They made sense to me, particularly
as they didn't play their single, with
lines such as T think he's a tree',
but I don't know whether that says
more about the lyrics or about me.
O f the songs they do play, Death
Sweet Religion stands out as the
best, but This Picture's melodic
style, coupled with their lead
singer's evident madness, makes
them a band to see, if you get the
chance and you have, if you can
face seeing M i d g e U r e , because
they're supporting h i m .

Dylans/My Life Story
— Underworld
My Life Story are different. They
have violins, flutes, recorders,
keyboards, and other instruments
not u s u a l l y associated w i t h
pop/indie style stuff, but they are,
and they do it damn well. They are
also reportedly Miles Stuffie's
favourite band. Hell, you won't
listen to me, listen to him.
The Dylans are a trainspotter
band. A n y band that sells a parka
coat with a Dylans badge sewn on,
and looks like this band does,
probably spend their spare time
looking for trains, well, I know I
do (Alex). If you close your eyes,
they're much better, indie stuff. But
someone, stand up the guilty venue,
pulled the band five songs into their
set, to the lead singer's closing
remark ' Y o u were robbed'. If it
wasn't for My Life Story, we would
have been.
L i s e Yates.
What can I say, a re-release of a
record that was rightly ignored the
first time. It is a dreadful dirge that
contains everything to make the
perfect chart 'dance' record. Y o u
know the sort of thing, the annoying
booming back beat, crap synths and
her voice, let's just forget about it.
Just to wind me up even more
they put three mixes of the same
song together, what great value. W e
have a 7 " edit (the one they'll play
on the radio), a extended mix (the
7 " edit with a three minute loop it)
and the mix that is supposedly
radically different.
T h e only point of interest is the
ring mark on the C D , you'll have
to buy it to find out.
It'll be a hit.
Pebbles.
