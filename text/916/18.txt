The President Speaks
Sports Centre
Following lengthy negotiations with
V a l Straw ( C o l l e g e Facilities
Manager) by Jonathan Griffiths,
I C U Deputy President, the sports
centre has returned the canoe and
diving club to their relative correct
times o f using the swimming pool.
However, there are still plans to
improve the facilities although no
decisions have been made yet. What
we need is your opinion on what
changes y o u ' d l i k e to see
implemented so that we may
represent everyone the best when it
goes to a committee. Therefore
please fill out the following
questionnaire and return it to
Jonathan c/o the Union Office asap.

Union Signs
O v e r the summer, the U n i o n
purchased some expensive and nice
signs for each room in the U n i o n
Building. These were designed to
make the building more accessible
so people knew where they were
going and they were also requested
by the students last y e a r .
U n f o r t u n a t e l y , some j u v e n i l e
members o f our community have
considered it 'good sport' to remove
those signs. I should imagine the
thought process went something
like: 'It will look better in m y
bedroom'. This is blatant theft and
is illegal. It is also unfair on other
IC students because o f (a) the
inconvenience of not knowing
which rooms are which, and (b) the
cost to the union o f replacement
must come from somewhere so it
means we must cut other budgets
for example bar promotions or
events could be affected.
M a n y students would appreciate
. it if the signs were returned. Please
contact me on ext 3501 if you have
any information on the whereabouts
of the signs. If they are returned by
next week then no further action
will be taken.
Welfare Week
The events of welfare week seemed
to go well except for the lack o f
attendees. I do apologise for the late
publicity but this is due to a number
of reasons—mainly lack of helpers.
Due to the lack of numbers, I don't
know whether the service is
required. C o u l d anyone who has
any comments about the events
arranged or events which should
have been held, please write me a
note.
Thanks
I forgot to thank the C C U ' s for all
the Freshers' dinners last w e e k -
well done and thanks for receiving
all my jokes (sorry about Steve's
though!).
Also thanks to the R C S for letting
me ride on Jez down to Brighton on
Sunday, I had a great time.
Zoe' Hellinger, I C U President.

Changing Facilities
Southside G y m Lovely Meetings

Free Weights R o o m I can't be too sure o f this week's

prepare a motion and submit it with

3. What facilities do y o u think the sports centre shouldn't provide? members to the President. This
forces the U n i o n to hold a meeting
within three weeks.
Events
Tonight is the Silwood Bonfire
4. If you have seen any facilities at other universities, what do you believe Party, as mentioned in previous
they have that we lack? weeks. T h e price is £5 (not as

including coach travel. There is also
an ents disco until 2.00am in the

5. What comments do y o u have o n the current pricing strategy? Research Pub Crawl/Collection.
F o r those not going to Maidstone
with R a g , teams can register from
10.00am onwards in the U n i o n
B u i l d i n g . T h e r e is a d i s c o
afterwards for the collectors and
with 300 students from other
colleges it should be fun.
O n M o n d a y there's a record sale
in the Junior C o m m o n R o o m and
in the evening there's 'Gaymers O l d
English Party Night'. This involves
cheap cider give-aways and a live
band.
Bar quiz and disco show up again
on Wednesday for a good tap and
b r a i n - s t o r m session. T h i s is
followed by ' T h e R e d Z o n e ' o n
Thursday, a night in the bar with
cocktails and lots more fun and
frolics. T h e n , on Friday, it's time
for a quiet week. R a g W e e k kicks
off with Guilds Carnival. So, if you
like a nice quiet and restful time, I
recommend y o u stay tucked up in
bed with a m u g of Horlicks for a
week. If you're not that boring
however, go to the events and be
crazy (or even mad, silly and part
of it as some flightless birds would
have it).
That's my lot, see you in the bar.
Steve Farrant, I C U Hon Sec
(Events).
