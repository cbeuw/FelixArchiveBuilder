He's
Dead, Jim
The T H Huxley (Secular Humanist)
Society, in collaboration with I C S F ,
will be using the life and works of
the r e c e n t l y d e c e a s e d G e n e
R o d d e n b e r r y - H u m a n i s t and
creator of Star Trek, as a starting
point for a discussion on the 'Future
of Humanity'.
O n Wednesday 13th N o v , in the
U n i o n Lounge at l p m , we will be
showing an episode of Star Trek
(from the I C S F library). But, while
nearly everyone has heard about
Kirk, Spock and Picard, how many
know that Gene's Humanism and
unshakeable confidence in the
capacity and future of Humanity is
the bed-rock of Star Trelc? A n d that
Star Trek is his Humanist Statement
to the w o r l d ? W h a t is this
statement? T h i n k about it...
O n Thursday 14th N o v , at l p m
in the U n i o n B u i l d i n g G r e e n
Committee R o o m (3rd floor), we
will start the (informal) debate
proper: 'The Future of Humanity'.
T h e link with the Wednesday event
will be a discussion of the visions
of the future of other Humanist
science fiction writers - like Asimov
(a devout Trekkie!) and Heinlein.
H o w many know that these were
H u m a n i s t s ? ( A s i m o v is the
P r e s i d e n t o f the A m e r i c a n
Humanist Association - and Gene
was a leading member).
Humanist are concerned for the
welfare and d e v e l o p m e n t o f
H u m a n i t y , and the H u m a n i s t
movement has a 'Manifesto for the
Future Humanity'. But, considering
the weakness in the numbers and
publicity of the movement, what
can it do to bring about change that
would benefit human beings? What
role do Humanists have in the
future? What will society be like in
the short and long term? W i l l we all
(all of Humanity) enjoy better lives?
W i l l rationalism and science win the
day and religion and superstitious
beliefs decline - without society
degenerating into an unethical
mess?
W i l l we have looked after the
precious environment upon which
we depend? W i l l we then be ready
to 'take to the stars' ? It is not just
technology that matters, but our
maturity as a species (ie the misuse
of science and technology by
humans in so many cases). D o you
agree with Gene Roddenberry's
c o n f i d e n c e i n the future o f
Humanity? D o you think Spock was
talking about Humanity when he
says ' L i v e long and prosper!'?
Boat Club
Last weekend saw the main national
rowing event of the term, with 500
fours racing over gruelling four and
a quarter miles of the Varsity Boat
Race course. I C had one of the
largest entries with 3 quads, 3
coxless fours and 2 coxed fours.
T h e best p e r f o r m a n c e was
produced by our 1st Quad, winning
the Senior 2 Division, and coming
10th overall behind crews of
international standard. This crew
c o n s i s t e d o f o u r u n d e r - 2 3
internationals Laurence M o r g a n
( C a p t a i n ) and fresher J o h n
Warnock.
O u r top coxless four also won
their division by over 20 seconds
(38th overall), despite clashing
blades repeatedly with other crews
for the last mile. This boat crew
included two of last years summer
first VIII (Andy Green and Ben
Poulton) and two freshers (Ed W i l d
and N e d Kittoe).
T h e coxed fours both finished
third in their respective divisions.
A good row having recently
suffered from injury and illness.
T h e other crews performed less
than expected, not yet being up to
fitness due to the late start to term.
T h e y still produced competent
results, with all but one crew
coming in the top sixty.
Winter training now begins in
earnest with the dreaded coxless
pairs matrix! Tickets are now on
sale for the annual Boat C l u b
Dinner in the S C R on N o v 16th.
A n y b o d y interested should contact
any of the following: Laurence
M o r g a n , Chris Parks (Mech Eng),
Marieke Hatton (Life Sci) or Heidi
Chaplin (St Mary's) before Tuesday
12th N o v .
Obituary
A former Imperial College student,
D a m o n Thomas, who finished his
degree last July was tragically killed
in a traffic accident in France during
this summer.
D a m o n was a former footballer
and will be sadly missed by his
colleagues on the field, as well as
for the humour and spirit he brought
to the club.
O u r sympathies are extended to
his family.

Dribblers
The Dribblers showed the men how
to really open the season by beating
the L o n d o n Hospital 13-0 last
Sunday. T h e fact that L o n d o n
Hospital had only 10 women had
nothing to do with it. Captain Permi
had a quiet game and only scored
8 goals. Other goals came from Jo
(3), Chris (1) and Rachael (1), who
had finally found the net after two
years.
T h e player of the match was the
goalie, Sandra, who eventually got
into the game towards the end of the
first half, after a back pass from a
defender. After this 13-0 thrashing
it was off to the bar for the main
highlight of the day - the customary
boat race. T h e Dribblers showed
consistent form by beating the
L o n d o n Hospital easily, despite
Ethel's attempts to the contrary.
After this astounding start to the
League, it was back to the usual
stuff for the Dribblers the following
week with a C u p game against
K i n g ' s College Hospital. Having
finally scraped together 11 players,
the Dribblers lost a player at
Victoria Station. After eventually
regrouping at the ground, the
Dribblers finally got down to the
business of playing football and
surprisingly found themselves 2-1
up at half time, thanks to two goals
from Permi.
But obviously, this was not to
last, and after 3 successive goals
from K i n g ' s , the Dribblers trailed
4-2. So picture the scene, 2 goals
adrift, 15 mins to go, and an early
exit from the C u p looming. A n y
other team would have broken
under the pressure, but not the
almighty Dribblers. In their true
valiant style, the Dribblers fought
back, against all odds, and levelled
the scores at 4-4 to make the game
go into extra time (both goals scored
by Permi). A n d indeed Captain
Perfect scored another two goals in
extra time, to finally put the game
beyond the reach of K i n g ' s , and
hence taking all the glory.
Orienteering
Last Saturday saw the Orienteering
C l u b compete in the Cambrdige
University Sprint-0. The event, held
in Bedfordshire, saw a number of
universities competing over a series
of 'knock-out' courses. Against stiff
competition, IC did well. Captain,
T . Nystrom, was placed 9th in the
w o m e n ' s c o m p e t i t i o n , and
newcomer, T . Toth, advanced to
the men's semi-finals, narrowly
missing a place in the finals. O .
Magyari moved into the women's
B finals, w h i l e S. D o n , F .
L o n g worth, A . Lovegrove and H .
Rutlin qualified for the men's B
finals.
Silwood
S i l w o o d P a r k hosts a n o t h e r
spectacular night of fireworks, fire,
food, fancy footwork and the band
'The Blue Shift' next Friday,
November 8th. O n arrival everyone

gross-out at the Knyves ' n ' Fawkes
barbie, including sausages, burgers
and veggie burgers. Inside the
Silwood main house will be a disco.
O u r live band, ' T h e Blue Shift'
was formed around the H a l l
brothers' watertight rhythm section,
and their upfront dance-til-you-drop
philosophy and mixture of classic
soul and funk is a crowd pleaser
every time.
Coaches will leave Beit Q u a d at
6.00pm and will return f r o m
Silwood around midnight. T h e
ticket price includes your coach,
f o o d , b a n d , d i s c o a n d

last week. See posters for details.
Tickets on sale now.
I would much appreciate it if
contributors could edit their own
articles before submission. The
style of many is depressingly
awful and I do not have time to
edit them all. —Adam.
