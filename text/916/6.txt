Next Friday evening Rag Week
starts with the Guilds Carnival.
There's so much already going on
that most people can't help but get
involved. A l l events will be detailed
in next week's F e l i x , but a
summary table has been put on this
'blind' for 24 hours (Monday/
T u e s d a y ) , v a r i o u s p e o p l e
participating in the Sponsored City
Pub C r a w l (Friday 22nd) and o f
course a positive plethora of people
participating in the Sponsored Nude

Rag Week Introduction
page for your information. If you're
not sure exactly what the events
comprise then see last week's Felix.
M a n y people already have
sponsored events planned, so if you
get the chance please sponsor them.
Amongst others, these include
Michelle and Cathy (behind the
desk in the U n i o n Office) dressing
up as T w e e d l e - D u m and Tweedle-
Dee for the whole day (Tuesday),
Rachel Mountford dying her hair
(with permanent dye) in the U n i o n
Colours, Stef Smith (Felix) going
(Saturday 23rd).
If you're not doing anything yet,
then see either your Hall Rag
Representative, Social Rep or just
turn up to today's or next week's
Rag meetings; there's bundles for
everyone to do, so come and see us.
If any of the above sponsored events
appeal to y o u , especially the last
two, come and see me A S A P for
details and a sponsor f o r m .
Everyone's welcome.
Lastly, the City and Guilds Union
( C & G C U ) still require slaves for
the Slave Auction - enquire at the
Guilds Office. Don't worry, there
are rules. S o go and sign up. A l s o
lastly, the Hall Rag Reps are getting
together at the moment to organise
a 'Giant C o n g a ' around Princes
Gardens on the Sunday afternoon of
R a g Week, so look out for that.
With a large enough turn out we
could also try and break the
Caterpillar Dash record - presently
held by Y o r k R a g . C o m e and join
in, it'll be a good laugh, provided
it doesn't rain.
Very lastly, keep a look out for
anything else happening, either in
College or in your hall. In a week
from now things are going to get
very silly, so don't miss out.

(any size) that we could borrow for
the week, please contact me
urgently.
Dear Flanaholics Anonymous,
...most people think it will never
happen to them, but they don't know
what it can be like during Rag
Week. Everywhere you turn it's
happening - people getting flanned.
There's no protection (except,
perhaps, if you 're the Rector) and
anyone could be the next victim...
Flanning is carried out by the
infamous Guilds H i t Squad. A
highly organised, finely tuned team,
whose sole purpose is to go out and
flan someone of your choice, for a
modest fee. Their excuse for this
activity is that all the money raised
goes to charity.
If you want to take a Hit out on
Various Nasties
someone, then pop up and see the
happy people in the Guilds Office
(Mech E n g Level 3) at anytime
during R a g Week. If y o u wear
contact lenses then y o u can obtain
immunity from being flanned in the
face, again by popping into the
Guilds Office. If y o u don't tell
them, they can't help y o u (that
applies to everything really).
If you think that you'll be flanned
once too often during the week,
then fret not, a solution is a hand.
Complete immunity. However it
does cost. Y o u have been told, the
choice'is now yours.
A Flanner.
in through the door. Now he had
cover. The day had been long,
maybe too long. He was starting to
loose the edge and he knew it. The
incident in the Common Room had
been close, maybe too close. It was
only his quick reflexes, a little luck,
and a clean shot with his pistol that
had saved him there. It was a stupid
move to check his internal post. A
mistake he would remember not to
make again. At least now he knew
who was after him.
On reflection the day had been
good. Three kills to his credit
already and it was only Monday.
The first two had been standard
pistol shots, but he had taken pride
in the third. An aerosol can with the
top taped down and 'Gas Grenade'
written on the side. He'd thrown it
through the open window, while his
target inside had been doing
problem sheets. He remembered the
pleasure he'd had, knocking on his
target's door and asking him to sign
his death warrant.
It was late now. He needed a
good night's sleep so he could be
up early in the morning to wait for
his next target outside Chem Eng.
He stopped outside his room. Even
this late in the day he could not be
too careful. He readied his pump
action shotgun and slowly pushed
the door. Crouching down he
peered round the door. Even in the
dim light he could tell that the room
was clear. It was such a relief. He
hadn't really realised how on edge
he'd been until now. Now he was
safe.
He made a last check, put the
draft excluder against the door to
stop any attacks from there, and
walked slowly across the room to
the window. That's when the
ringing started. It took him a minute
or two to find the package. It was
just under his bed. It was a small
box with an alarm clock in and
'Time Bomb' written neatly on the
top. How it had got there he could
only guess. However the long and
short of it was that he was now
dead. Just as he realised this there
was a knock at his door ...
Killer, there's nothing like it.
Take part. T h e idea is simple: on
joining Killer you are given a target
which you have to 'eliminate'. Once
e l i m i n a t e d , y o u p r o c e e d to
eliminate your target's target and so
on. A l l the while, however, you are
trying to avoid being killed by your
killer, who may change if they are
killed by their killer. Confused?
Never mind, take part anyway, it's
great fun and there are Cash Prizes
for the Winners.
T o sign up come along to the Rag
M e e t i n g today, in the U n i o n
Lounge at 12.40pm or to the I C
Union Office on M o n , Tue, or W e d
between 12.30pm and l.OOpm and
ask for Wens. A l l it costs is £2.50
+ 2 photos of yourself. So Be M a d ,
Be Silly & Be Part of It!
