Health &
Safety
Imperial College has been forced to
back down on its proposed changes
to the College Safety Council
responsible for Health and Safety in
all areas of College.
The changes announced last June
meant overall voting control of the
Council would stand with the
M a n a g e m e n t n o m i n a t e d
representatives. T h i s change,
t e c h n i c a l l y i l l e g a l u n d e r
Government Health and Safety
regulations, was to have been
implemented at the next Council
meeting, scheduled for the end of
October but is now delayed until
next Tuesday, without any prior
discussion.
T h e Manufacturing Science and
Finance U n i o n ( M S F ) , one of the
six unions in College, held an extra-
ordinary meeting last Tuesday. A t
the meeting, they voted to withdraw
from C o l l e g e committees and
procedures, and form their own
safety c o m m i t t e e , c a l l i n g o n
Management to join the new safety
structure. This would effectively
suspend all safety procedures in
C o l l e g e until M a n a g e m e n t
conformed.
M r J o h n P a i g n e , I n d u s t r i a l
Relations officer at Imperial said
that the control of the Committee
lay with management nominated
members which 'is not necessarily
the same as management'. H e also
stated that the Council did not make
decisions but 'advised' the Rector
so any changes had no real effect.
This has been hotly denied by the
Unions in College and lead to the
unanimous declaration from the
M S F meeting that 'Safety is not
negotiable'.
A t present, it is unclear why
College management tried to make
such a volatile move. A new safety
document has been produced,
reducing the management presence
at the Council. This new statement
will be discussed at the next Council
m e e t i n g on T u e s d a y . If the
proposals are rejected then the
entire safety structure in College
would be called into question.
A report by the lay chairmen of
university councils released this
week revealed that University
buildings and residences are in a
dangerous condition due to years of
financial neglect. It suggests that the
safety of staff and students is in
doubt and that an estimated £752
million is needed over the next ten
years just for the maintenance of
t e a c h i n g a c c o m m o d a t i o n ,
laboratories, libraries, offices and
student residences, in this country.
In addition, the report stated that
the 'ageing and deteriorating
facilities pose a threat to the first
class l e a r n i n g and a d v a n c e d
research required in the coming
decades'. A l s o it said, that ' i f the
level of expenditure cannot be
increased, then it is likely that the
fabric o f the b u i l d i n g s w i l l
deteriorate substantially, thereby
i n c r e a s i n g the r i s k o f total
breakdown of individual systems
and dangers to occupants and
passers-by.'
M r Gordon Marshall, Director of
Estates, said that he was concerned
about the problems raised in the
report, adding that it was a 'fairly
accurate picture of the situation'.
H e told Felix that many of IC's
buildings date back to the 1950s and
1960s and there was the potential
for a massive expenditure which
cannot be funded internally. He said
that it was necessary to replace
boilers, to rewire many buildings
and to solve problems associated
with flat roofs. H e said that
buildings are 'getting tired' and
currently 'internal services are
vulnerable.'
T h e U n i v e r s i t i e s F u n d i n g
Council ( U F C ) have set up a
working party, chaired by Sir Idris
Pearce, and Vice-Chancellors are
due to meet with the P r i m e
Minister, John Major, in the next
few weeks.
