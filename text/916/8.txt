Feature Felix 916 8 November 1991
There's Room at the Back
Sam Cox took two innocent babes, Jennifer Argabright and Toby Jones, around the country and corrupted them beyond recognition. Her evil schemes
are meticulously recorded in the following tale.
T h e G r e a t B r i t i s h Pub Run 1991.
I really don't know where to start,
mainly because I can't remember
h a l f the places w e v i s i t e d .
Portsmouth was the first o f many
stops o n our Tour de Brit. W e l l ,
what can I say; the place was full
of men - girlies get your skates on
and get down there. Most o f them
were quite sexy and all o f them
better than what's on offer here.
Other than that I don't think there
is much to comment on - sleazy bar,
usual prices, boring beer. Then on
to Southampton. I'm not really sure
what the students do down there,
but they haven't really made an
impression on the town - nobody
knows where the university is. B y
the time we did find it, the bar had
shut but the chippie hadn't and, i f
you should ever what to be insulted
by a fat Iranian, this is me place to
be. I must give many thanks to
Jackie, a good friend o f mine who
put us up for the night or rather put
up with us for the night without
much choice.
says it all:
'We hate Bristol,
and we hate Bristol.
We hate Bristol
and we hate Bristol.
We hate Bristol
and we hate Bristol.
We are the Bristol haters.'
Sunday - around Bristol and
around Bristol and around Bristol
and around Bristol...yes you've
guessed it they have a marvellous
one w a y system...and around
Bristol and around Bristol until
eventually w e reached escape
velocity and ended up at the Clifton
Suspension Bridge. A lovely view
- very quaint. So o f f the intrepid
travellers went i n search o f the
Great Free W a y to Warwick, a
town which has spewed out the
most ' A m e r i c a n e s q u e ' campus
possibly imaginable. Trees, fields
and so much open space that I ' m
sure all the students were lost
becuse none o f them were i n the
bar. W e were given a warm
welcome anyway, and some very
O n Saturday morning we headed
back i n an attempt to educate the
rather foolish young American who
came with us, Jenn. She was the
one who recently put her hand in the
Felix collating machine because she
was 'intrigued' by it. Charles
Dickens birth place is apparently in
Portsmouth, she thought. W e blew
out, fixed it and blew off again
towards Salisbury for an even more
educational afternoon. A s none o f
the pubs in Salisbury town centre
were showing the Rugby W o r l d
C u p , we went to see the Cathedral
instead, though after sampling the
local brews o f course. Absolutely
unbelievably gorgeous. If you were
to consume some rather noxious
substances I ' m sure you would not
be able to leave the town because
of the intriguing masonry and
ornamental crystals. T h e n on to
Bristol. A n d now for the song that
sound advice - ' G o to Coventry
Poly. - it's generally busier.' Thus,
off we went and got pissed again
with some o f the most pleasant
people we met on the trip. A warm
welcome (warmer for one, that
being Jenn), loads o f good cheap
beer and a few interesting drinking
games. Y e s y o u can guess, a
drunken debaucherous evening was
had by all and a number o f good
friendships started.
M o n d a y , hung over but fed and
watered, we set off for Manchester.
This was that point in the week
when the 400 Purity test emerged
and some interesting revelations
oozed their way to the surface. A s k
Toby how he managed that with the
shower hose - everyone I've spoken
to says it's impossible.
Manchester has three completely
lefty universities - they banned us
from selling the I C U R a g M a g
because it was sexist, racist,
h o m o p h o b i c , anti w h i t e -
heterosexual-males and funny.
However, the U n i o n President o f
Salford d i d hold o n to a copy
'purely for reference and to show
everyone how disgusting Imperial
College was.' T h e bar was called
the Mandela Bar, so we decided not
to stay too long. If the FoppeSoc,
a.k.a. Right W i n g Carnivorous
Heterosexual M i n o r i t y Society,
would like to pay them a visit one
day, I ' m sure they would be made
very welcome. T h e pilgrims then
headed West following the signs for
Liverpoopole. W e arrived at the
Albert Docks all keen and ready to
see the sights and promptly fell
asleep. Three hours later we awoke
and got out o f the car just in time
to see the Beatles M u s e u m and the
Animation Centre close for the
night. Liverpool University was
very refined and quiet - another
anti-everything college. However,
they did have pixies outside begging
for money to see the band that were
playing in the M a i n Bar. Sadly, due
to lack o f finances, we had to settle
for the L i v e r bar - not as in L i v e r
and Bacon, but as in the Birds, that
crappy 70's T V program. Jenn
wasn't really expected to know that,
HE
but at least she was of some use here
- she knew someone just outside of
Liverpool w h o fed us a slap-up
meal inclusive o f Black Pudding.
The poor lass was almost sick when
we told her what was in it. W e were •
tempted to stay but we had to get
to Glasgow and the L a n d o f F o g ,
F o g and more F o g . W h e n we say
Fog we mean Fog. 20 foot visibility
at most on the Borders. It started
just after we passed the River
Ribble - try saying that when you've
had a few. Arrival time 3.30am -
we weren't sticking to the speed
limit; the car drove far too fast far
too easily. M a n y thanks to Beccy
for getting up and letting us in at
such an unearthly hour o f the
morning, and thanks to John the
security guard who thought that it
would be fun to see the reaction at
her best friend travelling all the way
from L o n d o n just to see her. W e l l
it was really because the beer is
cheaper up there but don't tell her.
Tuesday provided the first chance
to have a decent wash and so, as
repayment, we let Beccy take us out
on the Beer or ' H e a v y ' as they call
it up there in the wilds. Their union
building is unbelievable! N o t only
do they have the socially aware
Mandela Bar, but there's about five
