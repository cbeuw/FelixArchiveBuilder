The Fisher King
Terry G i l l i a m is mad. T h e years of
drawing strange animations for
Monty Python's Flying Circus
melted his brain. T h e cabbage of a
man that was left went on to direct
a series of films that were nothing
if not original. T h e y are considered
by many to be superlative examples
of fiction with surreal influences...
But enough... cut the crap... cut the
hype... roll the credits.
Terry Gilliam has improved with
time, and this is without any grain
of doubt, his best film. It is perfect.
Richard L a Gravense's plotline is
minimal but highly effective in
allowing the characters to develop
in the two hours seventeen minutes
of screen time. Rumour has it that
it has been shortened for release
today which would be a pity; it was
by no means overlong in the first
place.
Watching the film, it was very
easy to forget that my screen idol
Robin Williams was playing the
role of Parry. Parry was Parry. H e
was real. He was a man. H e could
have been me. Similarly, Jeff
Bridges' talent was brought out by
Terry G i l l i a m , and the feeling that
he was an actor soon evaporated as
the mood of the film took over.
S i m i l a r l y , M e r c e d e s R u e h l ,
A m a n d a Plummer and Michael
Jeter provide great support.
I've already stated that there was
very little storyline. Very little does
happen, but what does is of great
s i g n i f i c a n c e . E v e n t s r e c u r
throughout The Fisher King, and
most of the film relates to a critical
ten seconds. It is as if a pebble the
size of the world was thrown in a
lake at that point, the tidal waves
spreading out and affecting all. It
obliterated those close by, and
nearly killed the thrower.
I don't really have to tell you to
see this film. It's going to be a hit,
if only because of Robin Williams.
It should be a hit, not for him alone,
but because the film is a beautiful
piece of work, from all involved.
I smell Oscars.

The Two Jakes Dead Again
Fifteen years ago Chinatown was a
massive hit, now Jack Nicholson
directs the sequel. Set again in L o s
Angeles twenty years after the
original, Nicholson is once again
Jack Gitties.
Nicholson sets up a husband to
confront his wife in bed with her
lover. During this, the husband
shoots the wife with a gun that could
not have been in the room. Simple
enough? Y o u ain't seen nothing yet!
T h e lover was in fact the husband's
business partner, and the husband
stands to gain $6 million on his
death. Obviously our Jack smells a
rat and starts to investigate. This is
where it starts to get confusing;
while this is going on, flashbacks
to the original Chinatown keep
appearing and a O i l Baron is trying
to elbow in on the oil underneath the
land the husband's business is built
on.
Although Nicholson was born to
play sleazy low-life detectives, this
cannot stop the movie slipping into
overindulgence. It is also difficult
to fault the acting of the rich and
famous (and talented) people who
appear, and show (again) how
b e a u t i f u l C a l i f o r n i a is.
Unfortunately the film does not
stand alone without reference to
Chinatown so it is unlikely to make
any Box Office impact.
A l l the same Nicholson can never
be awful and his cheeky grin keeps
the film going through its many
slow points. If you haven't seen
Chinatown then you don't stand a
chance, so go and see B o y z ' n ' the
H o o d instead.

A s in his debut film, Henry V,
Kenneth Brannagh takes up the dual
role of actor and director in his
latest effort, D e a d Again. In it he
plays M i k e C h u r c h , a private
detective, who is hired to discover
the identity of a mysterious mute
woman who has amnesia. C h u r c h ,
for convenience, names her Grace,
and B r a n n a g h ' s wife, E m m a
Thompson, plays her. A s you may
remember, Thompson too appeared
in the aforementioned Henry V.
Coincidence, I'm sure.
A s C h u r c h tries to trace this
woman's origins, an antiques dealer
who also just happens to be into
hypnotism turns up, with a view to
helping Grace by placing her in a
trance. Derek Jacobi plays this
character, and incidentally, his last
appearance onscreen was i n ,
surprise, surprise, Henry V.
What happens is that Grace has
a pastlife experience, regressing to
her life as the wife of a rather short-
tempered German composer, in the
40's. So short-tempered it seems
that he killed his wife for letting a
reporter, played by A n d y Garcia,
hold her leg. What makes the whole
thing eerie is the fact that Grace
bears a startling resemblance to the
wife, and C h u r c h looks incredibly
like the mad composer. W i l l history
repeat itself, or is the P.I. as
innocent as he seems?
For the most part, Dead Again is
a gripping yarn, with plot twists
galore, and Brannagh shows that he
can handle good old-fashioned
thrillers as well as Shakespeare. A s
well as thrills, he also provides a
few laughts, some of which come
from Robin Williams, who makes
a brief appearance as a disgraced
psychiatrist. The problem is, as well
as the deliberate comedy, there are
a couple of moments when the
laughter is unintentional, like the
over-the-top climax, for instance.
Still, don't let that put you off, as
this is one of the most original films
I've seen in a long time, and I
recommend it wholeheartedly.
Score: 8/10.
