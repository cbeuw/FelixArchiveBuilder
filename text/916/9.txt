N e w c a s t l e , the p l a c e w h e r e
Newcastle Brown comes from. Full
of loud obnoxious hockey players
(male and female) singing good old
traditional bar songs. Toby has been
awarded the Great White Shark fin
for his performances both here and
in Scotland. Yes, he has at long last
come out of his shell and is now sex
on a stick. A l l applications for
dinner with this hunk should be
addressed to T o b y 'no I'm not
going to tell you about the shower'
Jones c/o Felix. Security was tight
but very sexy. Let's just leave it at
that before we put our feet in it.

most disgusting thing they had ever
seen and were bound to sell on the
black market for at least 20p each.
A f t e r another d r u n k e n
debaucherous evening in the Bar we
headed off towards one of the halls
and a comfortable bed each for the
night. However, being totally
inebriated by alcohol and not
looking where I was going, I fell off
the edge of the world - well, the
kerb - and badly twisted my ankle.
I hobbled back to the hall (good
sympathy ploy), ate a nine inch
pizza and went off to bed with my
trusty companions. A t this stage we
decided that Nottingham needed
others as well, and a rather large
host of pubs around the town.
Feeling the need for a little culture
after a couple of pints, we visited
Glasgow Cathedral - very gothic.
T h e munchies induced a trip to
Sainsbury's, which coincidentally
had a rather large wine shop.
Dinner was a blur, as was the rest
of the evening as the 'local' for
Beccy's hall was doing £1.00 a pint
- we drank them dry by midnight
and were forced back to the hall
with some carry-outs. T h e best
thing about Scotland is the unusual
licensing laws. It seems to me that
at any point, day or night, you will
find at least one pub open.
Personally I'm moving up there
next week - transfer forms are

(address available from IC Careers
Office - 3rd floor Sherfield).
Beware though, the Scots hit
University one year earlier than us
at the ripe old age of 17 - this results
in them drinking all their lager
t h r o u g h straws and getting
completely legless on about two
pints.
O n Wednesday we kidnapped
Beccy, forcefully preventing her
from attending a lecture on social
history or something equally arty-
farty, and whisked her off to
Edinburgh to see the Castle. Jenn
- being the typical Yankee Tourist
- attempted to make the guards on
the gate smile. Unfortunately she
Flash an attempt was made
on T o b y ' s life when some looney
red head (a.k.a Sam Cox) made a
valiant effort to push him off the top
o f a rather steep h i l l .
(Un)fortunately he managed to
cling-on. Life was relieved by a
boisterous brass band hopping
around the centre of the market
place, dressed in rather bright
jackets. Thank y'all for getting rid
of some tension that had been
drew the line at going up and
undoing his flies - the chicken.
Being a little bit suicidal and getting
rather excited about the Rugby, I
thought it would be a good idea to
shout the England rugby chant at the
top of my voice... luckily the get-
away car was up and running and
had enough petrol in it to get us to
Newcastle before the Scots got me.
brewing for a couple of days. O n
to N o t t i n g h a m , another v e r y
American University. T h e U n i o n
Bar wasn't called the Mandela Bar
but was full o f some rather
emotionally unstable Raggies who
had just finished their Rag Runs for
the year and who very willingly
bought the last 50 Rag Mags we had
with us, saying that they were the
livening up and so began to sing a
full repertoire o f I C Bar songs. W e
were then joined by some 'dork'
who tried to convince Jenn that he
had some 'very interesting curtains'
in his room, and that she must go
back with h i m and look at them.
This taught us one lesson - all male
students are obsessed with getting
their end away, and that it's not just
those at IC which have the awful
chat up lines.
Friday, the last day of our trip
and where do we decide to go?
Cambridge, that place of happy
smiles and mad cyclists. W e enter
the E l e c t r i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g
d e p a r t m e n t ; S o c i a b l e s 0
Unsociables 1. W e go to Trinity
College to track down some friends;
Sociables 0 - Unsociables 2. W e go
to Fitzwilliam College; Sociables 2
- Unsociables 3. B y this stage we
were getting fed up with rude and
insolent personnel and so, without
finding anyone we knew, we sped
home to the trusty old I C U Bar.
Straight down the M l 1, back to the
smog of L o n d o n . . . breathe that air
- doesn't that feel better; the
knowledge that with every breath
you are reducing your life span by
about 30 seconds. Back to College
and into the Felix Office with the
warmest welcome we had received
all week - 'you're not leaving that
blown out tyre in here are you?'
Thanks A d a m - it feels great to be
back.
