Hallowe'en Sleepout
T h e letter by Leila Sherwin on page
two leads to a number o f points.
T h e main one is the apathy o f
Imperial Students. It is true that
L o n d o n students have been shat on
from an inordinately great height
for an awfully long time, and yet the
students o f this esteemed institution
keep their heads diligently down,
aiming for that not-so-far o f f well
p a i d a c c o u n t a n c y j o b . T h e
cumulative effect o f six thousand
students trying their utmost not to
m a k e w a v e s is s i n g u l a r l y
depressing.
Secondly, sit-down demonst-
rations perform no discernable use
except to fill up news pages with big
pictures o f indignant students. I
don't believe that the Government
takes an awful lot o f notice - the
Suffragettes had to chain themselves
to railings, burn acid holes in golf
courses and undergo force feeding,
but in the end it was the First W o r l d
W a r that persuaded the Government
that women performed a useful
function deserving o f suffrage.
Incidentally, I wasn't at the
sleepout because o n Thursday
nights I wrestle with our demonic
collating machine.
A mere escutcheon
It makes y o u so confident in the
country's press. Since the story o n
the 'Super Plug' ran, we have had
two phone calls from journalists
asking to speak with Richard Sea
(aka A l e c Baldwin, star o f ' T h e
Hunt for Red October'), claiming
that they have had no success in
finding him at Silwood Park. This
is not suprising, o f course, as the
story was completely fictitious. I
admit that putting a misleading
article on the front page was
ethically o n shaky ground, but it
would not be an exaggeration i f I
said I am very worried that anybody
could take it seriously. In addition,
I am amazed that the national papers
take any notice o f such small fry as
ourselves. T w o years o r so ago,
under the Smedley hegemony, a
feature was run concerning an A C
battery. T h i s caused as much
enquiry and is equally as ridiculous.
A late letter
I have received a letter from L a u r a
Barker, o f I C Association o f
U n i v e r s i t y T e a c h e r s ( A U T )
following my comment in response
to the letter by S . A . V . Swanson
concerning the college day in last
week's issue. I asked i f Trade
Unions had been consulted - M r s
Barker responds in the affirmative,
adding that there was 'very little
enthusiasm f o r the p r o p o s e d
changes', but that this view was not

taken to the College D a y working
party as the decision had already
been taken by the Board o f Studies.
The full letter will be published next
week.
Whinge
I apologise i f the coverage o f the
U n i o n General Meeting is sparse in
this issue; this is because it was held
on Thursday evening. Because it is
held on a Thursday evening I cannot
comment on it in this editorial
(written on Thursday afternoon).
Thursday evening is far and away
the worst time o f the week for the
U n i o n General Meeting to be
covered by the U n i o n Newspaper.
A n d y - the Rutland printer - is also
rather peeved with it because he
knows its coverage will delay his
going home time until too close to
midnight. H e finds this worrying,
because he tends to turn into a
pumpkin o n the twelfth stroke.
