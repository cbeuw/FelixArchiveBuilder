Apathy Strikes Again Strange
Dear Editor,
Does everyone at IC have enough
money? A r e you not affected by the
pitiful level of grants, by lack of
government benefits to students? I
think not! So why weren't you at the
U L U H a l l o w e ' e n sleepout
demonstration on 31st October? I
was and I saw only one other person
from IC there (Hi Ed!). In asking
around I generally got the response
' I C , they're all tories aren't they?'
A r e you? O r are you all just a load
of apathetic scientists willing to let
someone else make the point?
In case you're interested (a bit
late!) the demo was to protest at the
present Government's attitude to
students where money is concerned,
Dear Adam,
I am writing to complain about
the quality of service offered by the
in-college NatWest bank, which I
would describe as fucking shit, but
I will content myself by defining it
as less than adequate.
Anyone unfortunate enough to be
in a financial situation that requires
more than the insertion of a piece
of plastic into a computer embedded
in a wall (i.e. the use of a cashpoint)
may find themselves in the ghastly
circumstance of having to visit the
NatWest bank in the Sherfield
Building (if you have the bad luck
of having an account there—a
position I find myself in but will
soon rectify).
T h o s e in the k n o w w i l l
understand why I describe the
above situation as ghastly. F o r the
blissfully ignorant I will paint a
scenario that will outline the
problem: It's 12.30pm—lectures
have just finished and student Bob
rushes to the IC branch of the
NatWest bank. B o b ordered a
cashpoint card over six weeks ago
and despite repeated requests and
the creation of several embarrassing
scenes involving embarrassed bank
staff he has still not been issued with
a replacement card. Bob has also
filled out a form informing the bank
of a change in his correspondence
address on four separate occasions,
but to read and act upon this
information is either too menial a
task for the bank's employees or (as
I suspect) there are not enough of
them to cope.
especially with respect to housing
benefits. There was entertainment
'till midnight in the form of
musicians, dancing and jugglers and
some terribly boring political
speeches (although it was fun
booing at them and shouting
sarcastic comments). W e then
moved to Malet Street and lined up
along the pavements in sleeping
bags for the night (some of us did
try to settle down in the middle of
the road where we felt we would be
more noticable but the organisers
weren't too amused and the police
did persuade us to join the rest
before too long...).
A t this point it began to rain and
the night was spent wrapped up in
A n y w a y , Bob is out of money
and thoroughly pissed off at having
to cash cheques over the past six
weeks—he's going to the bank to
sort out things once and for all.
A s Bob approaches the bank he
sees a queue of disgruntled students
stretching from inside the bank into
the corridor. Peering round the
c o r n e r B o b (who is a v e r y
intelligent student) quickly identifies
the root of the problem (as he has
done on every other visit to the
bank); there are about ten people
waiting for normal over-the-counter
services with two or three cashiers
to serve them. A combination of the
high staff to customer ratio and the
short length of time required to
carry out these services means that
the turnover of the ten or so people
waiting for the cashiers is high. The
remaining people, however, are
waiting for the dreaded 'Enquiries
Counter'. There are about 15-20
people in this queue (many would-
be queuers leave after the reality of
the situation dawns upon them).
Behind the enquiries counter is, on
average, half a member of staff (the
other half is busy doing another ten
things at the same time) to serve 15
people whose enquiries will on
average be at least five minutes or
so in length. It does not take a P h D
in mathematics to realise that the
turnover of people in this queue
will, as a consequence, be bloody
slow. A n d as a consequence of the
bloody slow turnover of people, it
is 1.30pm before Bob gets to the
counter to be told that if he wants
dustbin bags and sodden sleeping
bags. However, many o f us stuck
it out (maybe something to do with
the fact the tube had closed for the
night?).
A n y w a y fun was had by all and
we maybe achieved something too,
as we did get on various news
programmes.
So, why weren't you there?
C o m e to the next U L U demo and
I hope you all had a worthwhile
time last Thursday alseep in your
nice warm beds of apathy.
O h y e s — i f you were one of those
living at College H a l l on Malet
Street watching us f r o m the
w i n d o w — F U C K Y O U !

a new cashpoint card he'll have to
fill out this form. B o b responds by
pounding his head on the counter
until his lifeless body slumps to the
floor. 'Another crazy student'
thinks the person behind the
counter.
Bob's life could have been saved
in three ways:
1) Increase the number of staff
available to deal with 'enquiries'—
after all, this is a bank that caters
mainly to students, and students, as
a sad consequence of many factors,
are bound to have more financial
enquiries than your average person.
2) Keep the enquiries counter
open after bank hours so that not all
the financial problems of 5000
students have to be dealt with
during the lunch break.
3) Have a separate office away
from the main bank where enquiries
can be dealt with more easily eg.
like the temporary NatWest stall
that was present with all those
elusive staff at the beginning of term
to entire us to open accounts.
Yours in anticipation,
A new Lloyds Bank customer.

P.S. I hope that this letter has as
much effect on NatWest bank as the
letter in last week's Felix had upon
the pricing of goods in the Q T .
P.P.S. This letter is not meant as
a personal attack on the bank
staff—they are probably as fed up
as the rest of us.
Dear Mr Editor,
I am writing with regards to M r
M c L i n t o c k ' s letter in issue
914—trainspotters? U s ? Never, we
wear anoraks with leaky pens in the
pockets to give us something
interesting to do while reading crap
and boring letters. It's all mindless
bickering if you ask me! O h , and
by the way, did anybody see the
new B R Intercity 225 at the Train
Fetishists Annual Conference?
From an Anoraksic Felix Bod.
Incorrect
Dear Adam,
W e were most dismayed to see
tha article in F e l i x 914, 1st
November 1991, regarding the
election of an Honorary Secretary
for City & Guilds College U n i o n
( C & G C U ) . Y o u r article is factually
incorrect and we would like to put
the record straight.
C & G C U , like all the other C C U s
(Constituent College Union)is an
autonomous body. W e therefore
run elections to our own election
rules, as set out in our constitution.
W e do abide by I C U publicity rules
as publicity will use I C U publicity
space. If you would care to look at
our constitution, there is a copy
available in the Guilds Office (Mech
E n g , L e v e l 3). I assure you that
nowhere within the constitution will
you find any reference to the order
in which manifestoes should be
printed in Guildsheet. Y o u will find
that the U n i o n E x e c u t i v e
Committee also acts as the Elections
Committee and we were quite
satisfied w i t h the way the
manifestoes appeared in Guildsheet.
W e are most grateful to the Editor,
Jim Shaw, for sparing the room and
producing Guildsheet on the day of
the election.
Yours sincerely,
Tim Proctor, President C&GCU.
The C & G U office was contacted
in connection with the story, and
the reporter involved was at no
time given any information as to
the differences between the
C & G U constitution and the I C U
constitution. Felix reporters can
only record information that they
have been given - the cause of the
error lies equidistant between the
staff of our two offices.
-Adam.
