Stress turned and ran down the
corridor looking frantically for a
way out. His legs and arms pumped
frantically, powered by implanted
chips who had decided that sending
signals through his brain was a
pointless detour.
He turned a bend in the tunnel to
confront a six and half foot robot
rollerskater wearing bright red and
green shorts and a six foot long
sound system welded to one
shoulder. This though was not the
thing that concerned Stress but the
fact that the robot had turned the
sound machine full on and was
chanting in time to the rhythm,
waving a massive gun like a heavy
duty baton.

Stress reversed and ran back
down the tunnel, the beat continuing
behind him.

This revelation was accompanied
by a loud bang as a piece of
concrete was taken out of the wall
near Stress's head. Glancing behind
him he saw the robot gathering pace
o n his rollerskates. T u r n i n g
forwards again he saw the tunnel
slope down just as he lost his
The following list of rules
represent the new regulations for
mascotry within Imperial. There are
substantial changes mainly as a
result of the accident that resulted
in one member of college breaking
his leg. In agreeing on these rules
there has been much discussion
over the general attitude towards
mascotry and it is thought that
things have got out of hand. T h e
idea of it all is to have fun, raise
money for charity and promote the
identity of the C C U ' s . T h e new
rules will hopefully allow a more
friendly atmosphere to prevail,
where everyone will remember it is
only a game and when it's all over
for the day both sides will be happy
to have been together.
A s well as the rules below other
activities with the mascots have
been suggested—such as a charity
challenge. T h e idea being that one
C C U challenges another, for a sum
to Rag, to do something silly with
their mascot. R C S U p l a y i n g
snooker on the Queen's L a w n using
Theta as a cue was one such
suggestion.
It is hoped that a joint C C U team
will be assembled to look after
M i k e , the mascot of Imperial
College, and also to promote
balance on the slippery surface.
Sliding down the slope he heard the
roller skates part company with the
ground for a second before crashing
down close behind him. A piece of
floor parted company with its
friends and flew up into the air with
a loud bang close to Stress's head.
The corridor bottomed out and
Stress scrambled up and staggered
clumsily up the curving slope of the
tunnel. Thirty feet up he lost his
balance again and fell on his back
to stare at his approaching Nemesis.
The robot had reached top speed
on the bottom of the slope and was
now hurtling towards him, stereo
shaking the walls. Stress watched
calmly, adrenalin exhausted, as the
robot took aim, fire and blew his
own hand off as the weapon
exploded.

S T O P ' T I L I C A R V E Y O U U P ! '
A s the robot rolled towards h i m ,
slowing on the steep slope until
within a few feet he swung at Stress
with his one hand, passing so close
to his head that Stress's cerebral
modifier chip with the naval
insignia was torn free from its place
mascotry at other Universities.
T h e most imporant point is
Mascotry is not dead and with
these new rules has hopefully got
a new lease of life. Please help to
make these rules work, if you want
to get involved in mascotry see the
V i c e President of your C C U .
The ' o l d ' rules still apply:
Overwhelming numbers shall be
2:1
N o breaking of the law or college
rules.
N o ex-students shall be involved.
Damage shall be the responsibility
of the individual(s) or the union if
the action was sanctioned by them.
There shall be no damage to college
property.
A l l the mascots should be placed on
display in cabinets within a
department of the college—these
cabinets will be safe, i.e. C C U ' s
will not violate a mascot in its
cabinet but it remains violate to
other colleges.
T h e mascots shall be inviolate at
the following times:

on Stress's forehead. T h e robot
overbalanced and began helplessly
rolling back down the slope.

Holding his hand over his wound
Stress clambered up the rest of the
slope and along the further passage
leaving the robot to stomp up the
slope behind him, extracting a new
gun from its innards.
Powered with new adrenalin
Stress dashed down the tunnel
looking for somewhere to hide. His
attempts to open the door were cut
short as the door was cut short by
another bullet.

Stress didn't wait to find out but
ran across to an open doorway and
dived into the darkness. A s he
scrambled around in the dark for
somewhere to hide he was grabbed
from behind and dragged behind
s o m e crates w h i l e a v o i c e
whispered in his ear.
' D o n ' t struggle, I'm a friend!'

Events off campus
W h e n in the respective department
containing the 'safe' cabinet. (Until
arranged this is to be the C C U
office).
This includes the journey to and
from the event.
A l l vehicles are banned from
violate mascotry since they are
harder than even rugby players.
W h e n the mascot leaves the
department building containing the
safe cabinet it becomes violate
unless agreed otherwise prior to the
event. T h e boundary for the R C S U
whilst Theta is kept in the office
shall be Imperial College Road.
During Rag Weeks the mascots
will be out every day and if stolen
are to be returned by midnight of
that day. A score of the respective
violations will be kept. A t the end
of the week a mascot exchange will
take place so that each C C U has a
different mascot and that mascot is
the responsibility of the C C U
possessing it, (nominally for three
weeks) and the 'captured' mascot is
to be used to help raise the money

violations that occurred. There will
be an extra sum required from the
C C U whose mascot was violate the
most. During this exchange period
the mascots cannot be stolen back.
T h e sum for violation shall be
fixed throughout the year and
should be scaled between the
C C U ' s regarding the relative size
of interest in mascotry. (£50 for
Theta or Spanner & Bolt and £20
for Davey are the agreed values for
1991/92).

will, until further notice, make their
mascot inviolate apart from the Rag

Other than Rag Weeks, the
mascots must appear at a minimum
of two C C U events per term where
they are violate.
Violation of the rules shall result
in a fine for Rag fixed by I C U Exec
on appeal of the offended C C U .
During Rag Weeks if the mascot
fails to appear that will count as a
violation.
T h e Spirit of the rules is to be
upheld at all times.
