Ned's Atomic Dustbin
— Kilburn National
The Wonder Stuff
— Camden Palace
Ned's are ones for originality, and
this reflects in the music; if you've
heard one, well basically, you've
heard them all. D o n ' t take that as
a criticism, since that one song is
dead good. T h e band started off in
fine style only to come to a grinding
halt three times due to a somewhat
dodgy P A . This enabled the fans to
subject the band to the rather typical
chants o f ' Y o u ' r e Shite' and ' F a t
Bastard'. But when they did play,
it was storming, with faves such as
Kill Your TV, etc. T h e floor was
a seething mass o f hot sweaty
bodies and Jonn 'the singing m a n ' ,
finished it off in fine style by falling
unconscious and playing dead...
T h e next night was C a m d e n
Palace's 5th Birthday Party, and all
the rumours were for an appearance
of N e d ' s . It didn't take long before
word got round that ' J o n ' had been
taken i l l , and so Ned's were not
appearing. First the Power of
Dreams played, who I thought were
good, but most o f the interest was
on who was to follow. W e l l I was
well impressed when The Wonder
Stuff took the stage, and so was
everyone else i f the shouting was
anything to go b y . T h e Stuffies
were completely brilliant and
played just their early, w i l d ,
m a t e r i a l a n d w e r e b e y o n d
comparison to most other bands.
I left Camden well satisfied, and
a m n o w l o o k i n g f o r w a r d to
December when the Stuffies play at
Black Rock Coalition
— History of the Future
Just to start I would like to say that
I hate compilation records and rock
music, so perhaps I ' m not the best
person to review this.
The idea o f rock music is that the
person compiling this collection
seems rather warped. T h e tracks
range from mellow tunes, more like
ballads, to the m o r e typical
screaming guitars and screetching
vocals. A t least they don't sing the
same macho lyrics as most other
groups o f this type do.
Lyrics are based around love,
personal problems a n d racial
problems.
None o f the tracks stick in my
mind, they all seem to blend into
one song forty minutes long. Sorry
but this ain't m y thing.

Manic Street Preachers
— Repeat/Love's Sweet Exile
I was asked, nay, requested, nay,
told, that at some point i n this
review I should make some
comment about this band's name.
S o m e t h i n g like c a l l i n g them
' M a n i a c Strip Prats' o r some,
variation. W e l l , what can I say.
This sort o f dictatorial leadership is
the kind o f thing revolutions are
founded on.
A s for the record, it's crap.
Where shall I start, is it the vain
attempt to sound like the early
Clash!, is it the complete lack o f
any song?, is it hell? Y e s
This lot said that they were going
to write one song that would be the
definitive rock and roll song, take
the world by storm and live off the
royalties for the rest o f their lives.
D o n ' t give up your day jobs, lads.
T h e y have some talent; they know
which way round to hold their
guitars.
B a c k to the subject that started
this review. If you can think o f any
better piss-takes o f their name, send
them to the Felix office before next
Friday and the best suggestion gets
it. ( T h e record I mean!)

Brixton—get a ticket and be there,
or at least wander over the Camden
Palace on a Tuesday night, and seek
out that den o f teeny indie-boppers
everywhere.
