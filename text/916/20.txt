M a n y students will be exempt from
the new ' C o u n c i l T a x ' , the
government's replacement to the
Poll Tax, or Community charge, to
be introduced in 1993. The Council
tax is expected to be law by
Christmas as it is being forced
t h r o u g h P a r l i a m e n t u s i n g a
guillotine procedure.
W h e n it is introduced in A p r i l of
1993 it will place residential regions
into bands. This attempt to reflect
variations in property value will
clearly give higher values in the
South East o f E n g l a n d . T h e
National U n i o n of Students ( N U S ) ,
to which IC Student Union does not
belong, has 'cautiously' welcomed
the new tax, despite the Labour
party's claims that some students
will pay more, adding that the new
tax is a shrewd pitch to get first-time
voters.
A l l full-time students in halls of
residence, hostels, or any building
in which the occupants are all
students, will be exempt from
paying the new tax. T h e term 'full-
time' is defined as those who study
at least 21 hours a week for 24
weeks of the year or more. If one
occupant of the residence is a non-

T h e police have reported that 'Blue
Star' tatoos, otherwise known as
tabs, containing L S D are being
circulated by drug dealers. Some of
these have been found to contain
strychnine* a chemical used in the
production of L S D which is highly
poisonous. T h e symptoms o f
strychnine poisoning are cramps in
the jaw and stomach, which follow
the usual effects associated with the
drug. T h e police advice is to stay
clear and report anything unusual to
them.
student then the people in the
building will pay 7 5 % of the tax,
while if there are two, or more,
non-student occupants the charge
will be the entire rate designated to
the area.
In b u i l d i n g s o f ' m u l t i p l e
occupation' (mixed students and
non-students) the building's owner
will be charged, and they will share
the amount amongst occupants as
they see fit. Students living at home
will not make any difference to their
parents' bill.
F o r example, the owner of a
b u i l d i n g valued at £250,000,
situated in Earl's Court, housing
twenty people of which two are non
students, will receive a bill for
£520. If the owner chooses to share
this equally among the occupants,
then each individual will pay £26
per year.
M r R o b B r i g h t w e l l , a
spokesperson of the Department of
the Environment, described some
features of the new tax as 'slightly
confusing'. Brian G o u l d , Labour
M P , has called the new Council Tax
an attempt to 'splice together an
unfair property tax with poll-tax
principles'.
Stress
T h e College Health Centre intends
to set up 'examination stress
workshops' next term. Although
they say that some stress is
u n a v o i d a b l e , such as around
examination, people who feel they
are particularly prone should
contact the Health Centre. If there
is sufficient interest workshops will
again be held.
T h e Health Centre is located at
14 Princes Gardens and patients are
reminded they are entitled to see
their medical records.

A c a d e m i c Study G r o u p which

is offering the places with a £500

Director, M r John L e v y , said that
they were offering 'academic study
and a little bit more..' for successful
applicants.
T h e deadline for projects is M a y

be obtained by writing to the A S G

Over a hundred students gave blood
at last Friday's annual City and
G u i l d s U n i o n ( C & G U ) blood
donating session. T i m Proctor,
C & G U President, told Felix that
only 60 people signed up for the
session in advance, so they were
expecting a low turnout. T h e event
was advertised in College media,
after which 115 people attended.
Out of this number 109 were
allowed to donate.
T h i s year the session was
organised by the North L o n d o n
B l o o d T r a n s f u s i o n S e r v i c e
( N L B T S ) for the first time,
replacing the South L o n d o n Blood
Transfusion Service only three
weeks before the event. M r Proctor
said that the date had to be brought
forward from Tuesday to Friday,
meaning that the Islamic Society's
Friday prayers had to be relocated
in the Union Concert Hall. This left
the larger Southside G y m available
for donations. T h e C & G U said that

A s p o k e s w o m a n f r o m the
N L B T S said that they gain only a
small proportion of the blood they
require at local colleges. She
continued, ' W e need to get young
fit people giving blood and show
them that it's no big deal, its not
stressful and it does not hurt. W e
need to get them into the habit of
giving blood, and its a good one.'
The session comes at a time when

beginning to re-emerge. T h e West

Regents Street, will soon be able to
open at full strength again and is
open weekdays to new and current
donors. T h e North london D o n o r

again at the start of M a y next year.
Acting Up
T w o weeks ago, on the front page
of Felix 914, there appeared a
totally ficticious ' N e w s ' story
entitled 'Super P l u g ' . A s acting
editor at the time, I decided to run
the story for the following reason.
I wanted to wake up the apathetic
masses of Imperial by presenting
them with something that, if read
with a modicum of attention, was
obviously fake.
Since very few realised the story
was untrue, I have obviously failed
in my attempt. F o r this I am truly
sorry.
