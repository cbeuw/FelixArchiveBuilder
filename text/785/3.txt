Pressing disasters
in
A minor contretemps with the FELIX printing press on Wednesday evening
left FELIX staff distraught and unable to continue printing for the day.
The operating lever of the press broke off in the hands of the permanent
printer, making it impossible to start the machine. Dean, the printer, said,
'Oh dear, the handle's broken, ****.' Fortunately the press is now back
in operation.
Rock-on Rob
This month's Network, the magazine
for the College's academic staff,
reprinted the following article from
The Scotsman of November 26.
A n extraordinary event was
celebrated last week. A small
lunch—rock-hard avacado, fish
pie and mousetrap cheese—was
given at Imperial College,
London, to honour the 14 young
graduates who had achieved first
class honours degrees in civil
engineering.
Network, however, devoted its entire
front page to this event which it
described as ' a celebratory press
lunch.. .designed to help recruitment
of women to the Department'.
Rob Northey, Refectories
Manager, who provided the lunch,
took exception to the description of
the food. He pointed out that monk
fish in lobster sauce was served and
that 4 or 5 other cheeses were offered
along side cheddar. He concedes that
some of the avocados served may
have been underripe.
Security
warn of
Killer danger
College Security have warned
organisers of the game 'Killer' that
if they don't restrict the game to
College, students may be seriously
injured. They are concerned that
diplomatic police may mistake water
pistols for real guns and shoot to
protect the embassies which they
guard.
'Killer' has also annoyed many
residents of College halls and houses
and has been banned from several
halls already.
Rag Chairman Nigel Baker said
yesterday: 'This is the first year that
we've run this game so we anticipated
a few teething problems which we
hope to sort out if the game is run next
year.'
