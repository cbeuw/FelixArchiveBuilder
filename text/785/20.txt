The ladies' Novice Crew
BOAT
Heading for home
Fours Head of the River Race
This 3-mile race on the Thames,
between Barnes and Putney Bridge
produced a good showing from the 9
Imperial College crews in afieldof
nearly 500 crews.
The top two crews came 6th and 8th
overall and 2nd and 3rd in their
division of coxless fours only being
beaten by the Great Britain crew who
came 4th in the World Championships
1987. This was an excellent result for
these two crews as they beat the top
crews from Oxford, Cambridge and
the University of London.
The third crew came in a
respectable 33rd, second in their
senior A coxless fours division. The
fourth crew also obtained a good
result coming 61st overall and 3rd in
the Senior A coxed fours division,
being pipped by Cambridge by one
second and tieing with Oxford
University.
The Collegesfifthand sixth crews
both the Senior A coxless fours
division also performed well coming
74th and 101st respectively.
Lower down the Club, the crews
also performed well, all coining fairly
high up in their divisions. The Senior
C coxed four coming 220th overall
while the men's and women's Novice
coxed fours (both crews having
members who have started rowing
this year), coming 342nd and 411th
respectively.
These results show the depth of
rowing in the Club with the top crews
up with the international crews and
the Novices holding their own against
crews of the same status.
TEN-PIN BOWLING
Bowled over
IC 10—Brunei University 0
IC came into their fourth game of the
season needing a convincing victory
(ie a whitewash!) over Brunei to have
any chance of qualifying for the
UCTBA quarter-finals.
Any hopes of winning the match
seemed to have evaporated when all
four squads lost their first games
(although the ladies were unlucky to
go down 461:460). What followed
can only be described as a remarkable
Imperial recovery with a simultaneous
Brunei collapse—not only did IC
recover from their perilous position
but all squads went on to win their
remaining games convincingly
enough for a 10-0 match result.
SAILING
Wind problems
This week we set off at a mere
leisurely time of 10.30am, to our
venue at Queen Mary Sailing Club,
against City (some 2 hours after our
usual departure time). Cheered by this
fact we arrived in good spirit spurred
on by the fact that there was a force
5 wind blowing.
City were first out and made a
noticeable lead on IC but not being
put down IC fought back with some
hair raising sailing to regain an overall
lead by the end of the day.
There had been a few swimming
lessons for the crews of a couple of
dinghys but most managed to stay
upright despite the wind problems.
RUGBY
Confident and
rampant
IC 1st XV 19—Brunei University 3
This was always going to be the
toughest game in the group, but after
three successive victories in the UAU
IC were confident of a good win.
Unfortunately the weather was very
poor and there were few glimpses of
the IC attacking play from previous
weeks. The team were well psyched-
up and from the kick off the IC
forwards drove the opposition back
to their own five yard line and from
the resulting scrum Andy Taylor
charged down and attempted a kick
for Rog Hargrove to score the first
of three tries.
A few minutes later good kicking
from Mike Anderson pinned Brunei
in their own 22 and from a scrum ten
yards out, a now rampant IC pack
drove for a number 8 push over try.
Brunei then rallied against IC and the
wind, and after swapped penalties, IC
lead at half-time 13-3
The second half was going to be
hard for IC with only a ten point lead
and severe conditions against them.
IC now changed tactics keeping
things tight and playing for territory,
as Jamie Mills was beginning to
dominte in the line outs.
A determined solid defence kept
Brunei for the first twenty minutes
with great tackling from Adrian
Kendell and James Deny, as IC
began to claw back into the
opposition's half. With fifteen
minutes to go IC were awarded a
penalty fifteen yards out. And from
the number 1 move Rob Hargrove
crossed to score his third. A
tremendous result for IC leaving
Rugby unbeaten in the UAU with 123
points for and 16 against. The man
of the match was Tim 'Sniffer' Paul.
WATER-POLO
Penguin flopped
IC Water-polo 14—Penguins III 4
The match started on even terms
(0-0); the Penguins surprised IC by
opening the scoring. The rest of the
quarter was hard-fought, ending 3-3.
After this IC's superior fitness
pulled through, and the reserves
proved that they were actually very
competent (despite Andre's designer
bermuda shorts). IC pulled ahead and
generally annihilated the
opposition—final score 14-4.
BADMINTON
Slow shuttles,
fast toes
Good performances from all the
teams so far have meant that Men's
H are sujre to qualify for the next
stages of UAU while Mens I and
Ladies both need a good win over
Kent to make absolutely certain. It is
particularly good to see the Ladies
team doing so well having lost 4
players from the side that have been
runners-up in the UAU
Championships for the last 2 years.
While the present pairs are not as
strong as their predecessor they are
nevertheless producing the results that
count.
In the Hammersmith League, the
mixed team has had a good start with
8-1 and 7-2 victories against Whitton
and Crescent respectively. The latter
match was notable only for the
incredibly slow shuttles that were
used. Julie and Sean got themselves
in a right old mess before they
realised that the shuttle could not be
killed, and that maybe a 'push' game
was a better idea, Bharat and Uta
played level doubles as opposed to
conventional mixed and Simon and Jo
(in herfirstmatch) played very well
to win 2 of their 3. Jo then spent the
rest of the evening being persuaded
by one of the Crescent men to play
with his big toes!!
At that point we decided to leave.
HOCKEY
Spare gears
It has been a disappointing week for
IC 1st XL By far the worst
performance was against Brunei on
Wednesday. Apart from when the ball
came straight at him, stoned
goalkeeper Rolf Slatter was totally
inanimate. In the outfield, the forward
line failed to capitalise on IC's ample
possession and the defence of
Stonham, Garside, Lewis and
Brooking looked hopelessly static
agsinst Brunei's fluid team-work.
On Sunday the lsts turned out
against Guilds (alias IC 2nds!) in the
first round of the UL Cup. Despite
only having nine players, C&G
fought all the way with Andy Rogers
and Duncan Fitter both scoring sharp
goals and attracting the attentions of
1st team skipper Justin Brooking. As
one would have expected, however,
the lsts cruised home 8-2 (Paul
Skipworth—3), with several gears to
spare.
