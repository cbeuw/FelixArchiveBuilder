hour late. She was obviously
nervous about the night as she
dropped her change (29 pence) and
hurriedly picked it up.
The next celebrity encountered
was Rick Astley (or is it Dick
Astley?). We agreed on the latter as
his dress sense was offensive and,
incidentally, he was noticed by a
keen eyed officer of the law to be
changing his shoes in the back of
his chauffeur-driven black Bentley.
An exclusive interview with the
chaffeur revealed that Dick Astley
had, as we suspected, rancid socks.
During the show we noticed that
Dick had changed his shirt. So
obviously someone had pointed out
this blatant clash of clothes, though
they couldn't have like him much
as he was still every designer's
nightmare. His miming to the two
songs performed was so atrocious
that one was unaware which song
he was singing.
Eventually the Miss World
contestants turned up in three coach
loads. As they were herded past us
into the building we spotted talent
in Miss Venezuela (the definite
favourite), Miss Turkey (who was
left out by the judges), Miss France
(who had a beautiful all over tan),
Miss Sweden (cute Cindy Doll
look-alike) and Miss Israel (a
soldier in the Israeli Army). We
hasten to add that there were many
unattractive girls rangingfromMiss
Iceland (a horse of a woman) to
Miss Belgium who had several
ageing lines around the eyes and
mouth. We suspect Miss Poland's
qualification to the semi-final was
purely political. Miss Lebanon
looked definitely as if she had been
dragged off the steets of war-torn
Beirut at gun point. Miss UK, yet
again, was as attractive as a brick
(we have seen better at Imperial
College, and Miss Cook Islands
was (quite frankly) grotesque. Miss
Denmark who won an award for
the 'most fake' smile of the
evening, was a sight for sore eyes.
Last year's Miss World, Gielle
Laronde (who was accosted by one
of the P.E.T.S. team), earned our
gratitude by smiling and waving
encouragingly at the reporters.
It was noticed that most of the
girls went in smiling, possibly
sensing a possible victory. Finally
a Red Rolls Royce drew up with Mr
and Mrs Morley, the directors of
Miss World Enterprises, who acted
as Chairman and prize-giver. They
were extremely obliging in posing
for our cameras with kind words to
accompany it.
Several more attempts to find
Tom Smith proved futile and again
the security men could not decide
on their story. But who gives a
damn about the press any way?
They also refused to allow an IRN
(used by local independent radio
stations including IC) reporter into
the building, because he was unable
to collect his ticket from inside the
building. The IRN journalist
advised us to come back at 10pm
to push our way through to the main
hall where even then we were
refused entry to the stage to join or
fellow journalists from the world's
media to interview the newly-
crowned Miss World.
After several attempts to get
closer, the management was
oblivious to the right of IC to cover
such local events. Therefore we
rushed back to the artists' exit to see
the departing of the 'cattle' from the
Albert Hall, sullen and
demoralised.
We were fortunate in getting
exclusive taped interviews with
some of the contestants, but the
brain cells between them could not
amount to a coherent sentence.
Events like this are obviously a field
day for the more perverse security
officers, one of whom took the
opportunity to rub himself
repeatedly against the very shocked
Miss India. Scandal of the night was
revealed when an officer of the law
disclosed that Miss America had
given him her personal phone
number.
The night was marred by an
incident involving the P.E.T.S.
photographer who, while trying to
obtain a photo of Miss World, was
viciously pushed by an over-
exhuberant security man, desperate
in his attempt to sit next to Miss
World in the Rolls-Royce. This
resulted in a minor injury to our
photographer but fortunately his
camera survived, remaining intact
and bringing to you all the pictures
of the night you were lucky enough
to miss.
