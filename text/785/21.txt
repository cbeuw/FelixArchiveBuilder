ORIENTEERING
Out of control
Last weekend, enthusiastic orienteers
attended events both Saturday and
Sunday.
Saturday's event was at Rowney
Warren near to Cambridge and
organised by Cambridge University
Orienteering Club. In the morning
there was an ' O ' sprint and in the
afternoon there was an 'Alcol' event.
The 'Alcol' event was 1.5km long and
had five controls each with an
alcoholic drink which had to be
consumed on the spot. A great time
was had by all especially those
members of the Club who stayed at
the first control and drunk it dry.
On Sunday, the Club 'tubed' it to
Epping Forest and competed in a
colour-coded event. Recent rain had
made the course 'swampish'—one of
the controls being situated in the
middle of a marsh. Orienteers had to
wade into mud, waist deep to stamp
their control cards.
Next weekend is the Churhill Cup
at the Forest of Dean. Training as
usual on Thursday 5.30pm in the
Union Gym.
CROSS COUNTRY
Useful leg
The Club has had two more outings
since the last report. The first of these
was at Guildford (Surrey) where we
had a big turnout for the second leg
of the London Colleges League.
There were good performances all
round taking the first team into 6th
place (out of 12) in division one, and
the second team into 7th place (out of
31) in division 2.
Our second race was also at
Guildford where we took part in the
Stag Hill Relays, which is renowned
for its lack of hills. This may not have
been our strongest team but everyone
had good personal performances. No
official results as yet but the race was
won by a guest team from Guildford
& Godalming A C boasting at ex-IC
runner in Gavin Waterson. The first
student team was from Bristol.
Please note a change of venue for
the third London Colleges League
race. This will not be at Shooters Hill
as there are still trees blocking the
course. Instead it will be a road race
in Battersea Park. Keep your eyes on
the notice board for further details.

Attack, attack!
C H X W II 1—IC n 2
H a v i n g stormed through the
preliminary round 17-0, IC fancied
their chances against Charing Cross.
Early pressure created chances for
Neil Vandenbegin, Alan Glass and
Guy Phiri, and finally, a superb chip
from Rakesh Muthoo bounced down
from the bar, and Byron Wood was
there to stab the ball home. The
second came about 5 minutes later as
Guy Phiri skillfully rounded the
goalkeeper and slotted the ball into an
empty net. Just before half-time, Guy
was fouled to give IC a penalty, and
a chance to kill the tie. Russ Dark
stepped up and confidendy blasted the
ball over the bar. This inspired
C H X W H, and they rallied well in the
second half.
Then came the moment people will
talk about for years: A n IC attack was
broken down, leaving Byron Wood
and a defender tangled on the floor.
As they got up, Byron unleashed a
right hook that Mike Tyson would've
been proud of—had it hit anyone! The
referee saw this and sent Byron off
for an early bath. With IC down to
10 men again! C H X W pressurised,
and shortly scored past Simon
Holden. However, a very disciplined
performance kept them out, except for
a late disallowed goal, and IC go
through to the next round. Thanks to
stuart Miller for vocal support,
IC lsts 4 - L S E lsts 1
This game was very important; it was
a league game and a U A U game. IC
started the game well, closing down
and chasing everything, although IC
were playing against the wind in the
first half they had most of the play.
IC conceded a goal, against the run
of play, when the mid-field failed to
clear the ball and gave it away deep
in IC's half which left the defence
helpless and an easy goal for L S E . At
half-time the score stood at 1-0
IC started the second half
determined not to let the game slip
away. They were putting L S E under
a lot of pressure and with LSE playing
against the wind they were finding it
hard to prevent IC from scoring. The
first goal came when IC cleared a
corner on to which Paul Stott
managed to run. Running into the
box, he passed the ball across the face
of the goal leaving an easy chance for
Nigel Collier to score.
L S E were finding it hard to get out
of their own half with IC Closing them
down and the wind making it very
difficult to clear the ball. IC's second
came when Simon Cole hit the net
from 25 yards. Even though IC were
having most of the play L S E seemed
to have a lot of room when they were
coming forward; something that will
have to be worked on in the future.
Two more goals were to come; one
from Paul Stott and one from Nigel
Collier making the final score 4-1.
