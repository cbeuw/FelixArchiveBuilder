F e a t u r e s
Not tobe
Miss'd for
the World!
Last week saw the
annual Miss World
contest take place
in the Royal Albert
Hall. How many IC
students were
actually aware that
78 (supposedly)
beautiful girls from
all corners of the
globe moved into
the College vicinity
for a few hours?
Where were all you
budding casanovas?
The FELIX
P.E.T.S. team
decided to
investigate the
event and meet the
'celebrities' who
ran and attended
the show.
A night to remember began at
5.30pm, with the P.E.T.S. team
trying to obtain official press passes
into.the 'cattle market'. We were
referred to the Press Liaison
Officer, Mr Tom Smith at the posh
Tara Hotel. After several phone
calls to the hotel we were told that
the Press Office was closed
(conveniently). Undeterred by this
massive set back we returned to the
Security Office at the Albert Hall
to ask, again, if the main in question
had arrived. We were told that he
was yet to arrive, but as his identity
was unknown to us he would be
informed of our presence
(incidentally his identity is still
unknown to us!). We were then
asked to leave the warm building by
a security officer.
Back outside in the polar
conditions three policemen
approached us who were out in full
force to guard the contestants. For
the next hour, as we steadily froze,
we chatted to the police on local
issues to pass the time. We found
that they were pro-IC and also told
us that the increasing numbers of
law enforcement officers in the area

was due to Christmas and not for
possible IRA attacks as we had
feared.
The first celebrity to arrive was
the arrogant Linford Christie who
blatantly ignored us and other
freelance photographers. It was nice
to see him have to wait for someone
for a change and his date arrived an
