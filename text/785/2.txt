Yesterday evening (Wednesday) the
Print Unit suffered another set-back
in a long line of machine failures and
breakages. The operating handle on
our printing press sheared off. This
is not bad going for a machine which
is just over a year old and made by
a company with a reputation for
reliable lithos. We could have got
depressed, but we didn't. Most of this
issue has been printed by an outside
contractor and you are reading this
issue because of an enormous amount
of hard work put in by the FELIX
staff to get it ready in time to send it
out. I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all of them for
their help and encouragement,
especially Chris Martin, Dominic
Strowbridge, Bill Goodwin and
Mole(!) who stayed up on Wednesday
night to finish off pages.
St Mary's
Many of you will already have heard
that Imperial College will become the
•Imperial College of Science,
Technology and Medicine in August
1988 when we merge with St Mary's
Hospital Medical School. We are
pleased to announce that St Mary's is
now receiving a limited edition of
FELIX each week. If anybody who
is reading this and going to St Mary's
would like to work on FELIX,
perhaps as St Mary's correspondent,
then get in touch with me on 01-589
5111 ext 3515.
Ian Howgate
Within these pages is an opinion
article on FELIX and the possibility
of it being biased against Ian
Howgate. I hope you will notfindit
incestuous that FELLX prints criticism
about itself. Ifindit extremely useful
to read and learn by such criticism.
While I acknowledge that some of
what has been said is true, I cannot
agree with the sentiment.
Firstly, FELIX is provided to
inform, entertain and criticise. This
• is a phrase I tend to overuse and it
came up in my elections speech last
year. Ian Howgate does a great deal:
some of it good, and some of it bad—
the bad gets criticised. I steer away
from the brown tongue treatment in
my editorials.
Secondly, FELIX printed the
'irresponsible Ian' news story and Ian
refused to speak to our reporters or
write for us! We all sat round waiting
for Ian to grow up.
Thirdly, the author of the opinion
article draws a comparison between
the treatment of Ian with that of Carl
Burgess, President of IC Union in
1985/6. In that year, the FELIX
editorials went on about trivia while
Carl was getting away with murder.
This did more damage to the Union
than telling everybody would have
done.
Fourth, Ian puts a lot of work into
his job. He was the only one who
really wanted to be President this year
and he is going out to prove that he
was the best choice. Ian is a good
President because he cares about his
job. He is, however, irresponsible in
the things he says and not at all good
at working with people. He ought to
take a tip or four from College
Secretary John Smith about
diplomacy. He is also extremely easy
to wind up.
Fifth, it's Ian's wacky ideas that
made FELIX a good read every
Friday!
If Ian learns to calm down, and to
think before he speaks then I reckon
that he will make a jolly good
President.
The other sabbaticals
Having passed judgement about Ian,
I feel that it is only right to give brief
views on Alan Rose, Deputy
President, and Chas Jackson, Hon
Secretary.
Alan, as far as I have heard, has
been efficient. He also has the
marvellous gift of sounding like he
knows what he is talking about. He
helped to collate last week's FELIX
so he has gained this week's FELIX
Sabbatical Gold Star Award.
Chas Jackson, on the other hand,
has turned out to be the joke
sabbatical. Chas is very good at
reading newspapers but I don't think
that is part of the Honorary
Secretary's job description. He is not
very good at getting council papers
ready, insurance dealt with or
problems sorted out. Chas, however,
is a nice person, which is why I've
never mentioned his faults before.
Drink a Pub Dry
This has to be one of the stupidest
ideas for raising money for Rag—it
doesn't raise any! Why do they go out
to a place which they obviously can't
drink dry (this year it was the
University of London Union Bar) and
spend all the money they've got left.
No wonder nobody has enough
money to go to the Guilds Carnival.
Morphy Day
Hiss! Boo! The ICU Executive didn't
bother to turn up to Morphy Day on
Wednesday—after they told me that
FELIX had to make up the fourth man
of their boat crew. Our boy, Sports
Editor Dominic Strowbridge, went
through rigorous training to be
selected from the fine athletes that
frequent the FELIX Office. I bet we
would have won as well!
Student survey
We have another one of our special
FELIX surveys in this week's issue.
We have used the same questions as
two years ago which should enable us
to see how the average IC student has
changed. I would be grateful if you
could get your answers into the
internal mail either today or on
Monday so that we will have the
results analysed for the 4th December
issue.
Rag
With so many different rag totals
rolling into the Office this week, I'd
also like to announce that FELIX
made just under £200 for IC Rag last
week. Thank you to everybody who
gave 20p for small ads and diary
entries and to all last week's
advertisers.
Bad debts
The Union Print Unit runs to break
even. We charge for materials used
only because the Union pays all the
labour costs. We make no profit on
the printing we do for Union clubs
and societies. We sometimes even
undercharge! Like every
organisation, we tend to undergo cash
flow problems during parts of the
year. These problems are brought
about by people notpaying their bills.
We give everybody one month's
credit and only one month's credit.
The following individuals and clubs
are bad debtors and will not be able
to use the services of FELIX or the
Print Unit until they pay up:
Amnesty International
Nigerian Soc
Chas Jackson
CSSA
Anti-Apartheid
ConSoc
Nicky Alison
Lester Kerschenbaum
WIST
SocSoc
DocSoc
Selkirk Hall
ChemSoc
Nightline
Yacht Club
Billiards & Snooker
RCSU
RSM
Don't expect to see any diary entries
from any of these!
Finally...
We've run out of sweatshirts for the
moment but there are more on order
for Christmas.
There will be a staff meeting at 1pm
today.
