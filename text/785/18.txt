Didn't you kill my brother?
Another Comic Strip production made
for Channel 4, Didn't you kill my
brother? is an East-End gangland
spoof concerning the notorious Moss
—no relation to Kray—twins, Carl
and Sterling (both played by Alexei
Sayle).
When Carl is released from prison
where he was framed for the murder
of Eric 'Cheesedish' Sweeny by
Sterling, the rivalry between the
brothers is renewed. Sterling is the Al
Capone of Stepney and Carl the
reformed socialist visionary. During
his stay in prison Carl gains 428
different educational qualifications
including many City and Guilds
certificates. He attempts to usurp his
brother's bicycle stealing operation by
setting up a workers' co-operative
with the children Sterling forced to
steal bikes.
Carl's idealistic socialism brings
him into conflict with the community
police led by Sergeant Chipstick
(Peter Richardson) and the head of the
'family firm', his mother (Beryl
Reid).
Basically, the film is an excuse for
Alexei Sayle to do a stand up routine
as he stumbles across London meeting
old friends. Watch out for the great
Crime cabaret act by Sterling—Sayle
on home ground. His surreal humour
is at best hilarious and at worst
bizarre—"Where are all the
spoons?".
Plenty of great situations, such as
the community police over-60s reggae
club, the obligatory Dr Martens
routine, Chinese Takeaway and
Architects provide an ideal source for
Sayle's observational humour.
This is as good a Comic Strip as
any, but take a beer just in case.

Mr Jolly Lives Next Door
Alcoholic incompetents Rik (Rik
Mayall) and Ade (Adrian Edmonson)
run the Dreamytime Escort Agency.
Next door Mr Jolly (Peter Cook) is
an axe-wielding psychopath,
performing contract killings under the
cover of a fluffy toy company.
After taking out a Japanese
businessman for a 'good time' which
involves visiting the sights of London,
two dozen Old English pubs, an
illegal drinking club and spending all
his money, Rik and Ade's luck
changes. Together they accidentally
recieve £3000 and a note meant for
Mr Jolly to 'take out' Nicholas
Parsons (himself). By using both their
brain cells together they decide to
spend all the money on gin. Then they
then read the note. By contrived
coincidence they end up going out
with Nicholas Parsons and trashing
his house.
Meanwhile, the notorious Mr
Lovebucket (Peter Richardson),
supplier of most of London's off-
licences (the others seem to burn
down) catch the pair and force them
to complete the contract on Parsons,
supplying them with a gun, two
grenades, a chainsaw and a fluffy
rabbit!
This pure slapstick, Comic Strip
style. Rik and Ade remain alcohol-
crazed throughout their escapades and
are a perfect double act, throwing up
in all the right places. Peter
Richardson plays the vicious and quite
mad Mr Lovebucket convincingly,
and Nicholas Parsons is suitably
confused by the whole affair. Ade
even has a tatoo to celebrate their
meeting, saying "I've been out with
Nicholas Parsons" across his
forehead and when he looks in a
mirror exclaims "Oh no! They put it
on backwards!".
Riotously paced and way over the
top, Mr Jolly lives next door is very
funny in the best Comic Strip
tradition.
(Currently showing as a double bill
at the Cannon Baker Street, or

Vaselines, Membranes
and Pastels
(ULU)
The Membranes are punk's revenge
on the eighties, they lead you to an
after-world where the content of the
songs is overshadowed by thrashing
guitars and trash drums, the God of
this world sung jerkily, his eyes
turned towards the ceiling. This,
coupled with a sideshow consisting of
two gentlemen, a pair of scissors,
body paint and cellophane made for
an exhilerating and comical set.
Such a performance as this, leads
inevitably to a feeling of
disappointment on being dropped into
the more mundane world of the
Pastels. Three to four years ago the
fresh jangly pop tunes were exciting,
surreal in their childlike view of life,
but three years on there is little vitality
to be found in Steve Pastel's voice
which shamefully let down the wall
of sound built up by the other
members of the band. Starting with
their best song; Baby Honey, their
latest song, Coming Through closely
followed. Truck train tractor stood
out slightly mainly because of a few
misguided yelps midsong, but
gradually the songs became as one,
pausing slightly for sporadic
applause. Thefirstsupport band, the
Vaselines, with a splattering of
feedback still show a glimmer of
hope, but their four song set was not
really enough to judge them by.
