Harrier hits Hill in
mid-air collision
The Chairman of IC Hang Glider Club, Andrew Hill, was involved in
a mid-air collision on Saturday. Mr Hill wasflyingthe HGC's main glider
at Devil's Dyke on the South Downs.
He was about 150 feet above the
ground and there were around 15
gliders in the air at the time. He had
beenflyingfor twenty minutes and a
blue glider had come very close to
him on two occasions. He said, T saw
a flash of blue wing above me and
then felt a crash on my left wing'.
Mr Hill had to make an emergency
landing. The wing cross-tube was
badly damaged and will cost
approximately £200 to replace. The
other glider involved, a Harrier, kept
flying after the crash.
Mr Hill said, T was a bit shocked.
I didn't know what had happened.
Looking back, I'm very angry—he
could have killed me."
He accused the other pilot, Mike
Allen of Southern Club, of 'flying like
a maniac'. Mr Allen admitted
responsibility and agreed to pay repair
costs.
A British Hang Gliding Association
spokesman explained that all pilots of
hang gliders must follow the rules of
the Civil Aviation Authority. There
is a code of conduct for hang glider
pilots. It includes the words 'when
two gliders are on converging paths
the one on the right has the right of
way'.
Two members of the City and
Guilds College Motor Club, Clive
Hudson and Timo Hannay, were
involved in an accident which wrote
off their car whilst competing on a
club rally last Friday. Mr Hudson was
driving down a narrow country road
when he encountered a 90° left hand
bend which only appeared as a 50°
bend on navigator Mr Hannay's map.
The car, a Mini Countryman 1300,
went onto the grass and crashed into
a pile of logs, sustaining considerable
damage to the subframe mountings
andfloorpan.Both occupants were
totally unhurt.
C&G Motor Club Captain Jon
Stout said that accidents on rallies
were rare, with only one occurring in
the whole of last year. He stated that
all events are run under RAC Motor
Sports Association rules with all
possible precautions taken. Drivers
are fully briefed and cars scrutineered
before events and the club is properly
insured.
Alan Rose, Union Deputy
President, feels that the Union should
continue to support 'dangerous' sports
such as hang gliding, caving and
rallying as long as the clubs are run
responsibly. He places the onus of
ensuring the safety of club members
on themselves.
