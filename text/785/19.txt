Hunger
The Hunger, Tuesday November 24
7.00pm ME 220,
50p members, £1.50 rest of the world
Following hot on the heels of the
rather cerebral Scanners we bring you
the inimitable The Hunger, the story
of a woman who, while researching
the ageing process, discovers an evil,
immortal woman who is searching for
a cure—or replacement—for her
ageing lover.
This is the film you all voted for
(those present at the relevant library
meetings—why weren't the rest of
you there?). So I hope you all come,
it's a goodie.
This one will start as soon as the
last person to turn up before 7pm is
seated, so anyone arriving at
7.15pm—don't be too surprised if it's
started.
Watch this space for news of a
double bill including Highlander, also
Star Trek IV (we hope) and the
Christmas sherry, mince pies and
library meeting (you hope)!

Hungry?
Fancy joining the Curry Soc? If you
do, you could do worse than come to
our meeting on Monday at 12.30pm
in the Lounge above Southside Bar.
We will be discussing curry recipes
and arranging the next Curry Soc
outing—so do come along.
Now for a review—The Delhi
Brasserie in Cromwell Road. On
walking through the door, The Delhi
appears dim and smokey—or
atmospheric depending on your point
of view. On a Friday night it is
usually packed and you may have to
wait for a table. The service is slow,
typically taking 45 minutes or more
to get your meal. The food, however
is very good, though the portions are
on the small side. The menu is limited
to the standard range with a few
speciality dishes.
Be warned though The Delhi
Brasserie is expensive, averaging £10
per meal even with the 1
0
% discount
for IC students. Not somewhere you
could afford to visit every week.
Summary:
Food—v tasty
Service—friendly but slow
Surroundings—dim
Price—expensive

Trials and tribulations
The Guilds Motor Club continued
their assault on the country lanes of
southern England with 'The Five
Counties Rally', a 110 mile event
from Sandhurst to Marlow on
November 13/14 November.
The format of these night
navigational rallies is that coded
instructions of a section of the route
(typically 10 to 20 miles) are given
to the navigator who translates this
onto the map and then directs the
driver around the route. The more
experienced the crew, the more
obtuse the form of code used. To
check that the crews go the right way
the organisers place passage control
(PC) boards along the roadside which
the navigator enters on the routecard.
Yet again the event was dominated
from start tofinishby Paul Dent/Paul
Brooks-Johnson, the only crew to
drive the route totally correctly and
only dropping 9 minutes in the
process.
The event was also notable for the
number of problems suffered by other
competitors. The most serious of
these affected the Mini of Clive
Hudson/Timo Hannay. An electrical
fault delayed their start and later on
the car suffered considerable damage
to the subframe mountings and
floorpan when it went straight on at
a 90° left-hander and crashed into a
pile of logs.
Lee Stanley suffered an exploding
clutch on his Marina and the Mini of
the Honigman brothers lost its
exhaust. Second again were Duncan
Royle/Ian Hamill and third were
Andy Larkins/Susan Forister.

FILM
Nightmares
IC Film Soc presents After Hours
A chance encounter with a girl leads
a young yuppie into a nightmare
world where everything that can go
wrong does. Martin Scorcese, who
directed Color of Money, times his
black humour perfectly, making this
a film not to be missed!

Short night
Student Television of Imperial
College presents Into the Night
We haven't got the energy to produce
anything similar to last week's
extravaganza, so we have altered the
times a bit, and made Into the Night
shorter. We will be on air on Friday
November 20 from 7pm until about
1.30am, showing films and music
videos. From then on we will be
broadcasting at the same time every
week, so now you have some great
entertainment to look forward to at the
end of the week!

INTERNATIONAL
Held
without
trial
Ghassan Najjar has been detained
without charge or trial since his arrest
in April/May 1980. He is one of a
group of engineers, doctors and
lawyers arrested following a one-day
national strike on March 31 1980
calling for an end to the state of
emergency declared in 1962, the
abolition of the state security courts
and release of all untried detainees.
Ghassan Najjar is currently held in
Adra Civil Prison in Damascus. In
July 1984 Amnesty International
appealed urgently to the Syrian
authorities on his behalf after
receiving reports that he had been
transferred to hospital for urgent
treatment earlier that month.
According to reports received at the
time, he had been beaten up by prison
guards in an attempt to force him to
abandon a hunger strike he had begun
in June 1984 in protest against his
continued detention without trial. He
was also said to be suffering from a
spinal injury.
Al appealed on his behalf again in
October 1986 after receiving reports
that he was suffering from a fractured
spine, a damaged heart muscle
(myocardial infarct), a stomach
haemorrhage and stomach ulcers. His
psychological state was described as
very poor and Al remained concerned
that his health was continuing to
deteriorate in the absence of adequate
medical treatment.
Please send courteous letters to
urge the authorities to ensure that he
be given all necessary medical care
and treatment, and to appeal for his
immediate and unconditional release.
Write to: President of the Republic,
Hafez al-Assad, Office of the
President, Muhajirin, Presidential
Palace, Abu Rummaneh, Al-Rashid
Street, Damascus, Syrian Arab
Republic.
