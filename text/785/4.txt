Nuclear Daydreams \

The Fifth Column
This week the Fifth Column takes
a look at the impending arms talks
due to begin early next month. Will
agreement be reached? How will
the talks affect the nuclear
stockpile? How can technology be
used to ensure that both sides play
fair. The Verification Information
Technology Centre (Vertic) is an
organisation which considers these
problems in great depth, and
operates a key role in advising
politicians about arms control. Bill
Goodwin went to find out more
from the organisation's founder, Dr
Jeremy Legett
The Verification Technology
Information Centre, known as Vertic,
was founded a year and a half ago by
Jeremy Leggett, an earth sciences
lecturer at Imperial College. The
organisation researches the problems
posed by arms verification and keeps
a careful check on the latest
developments within the arms race—
an emotive subject in the light of the
'It's fear that time is
running out that motivates
me—time is running out'
forthcoming arms talks. Since its
initiation, Vertic has established a
wide range of contacts amongst peace
and weapons researchers in both the
United States and the Soviet Union
which enables it to provide briefings
for politicians, the press and members
of the public as well as discussion
documents for the Ministry of
Defence.
Jeremy Leggett founded the
organisation as a gut reaction to a visit
he paid to Hiroshima and Nagasaki
two years ago. 'It was a very
depressing experience,' he says, 'until
you've seen the effects, you don't
realise how destructive nuclear
weapons can be. You realise that
when people talk about a limited
nuclear war it's an absolute joke'.
He is however optimistic about the
arms talks due to begin next month,
'The whole subject of
verification is like a fog to
the general public'
when the question of verification will
become a major issue. The
superpowers have tabled draft treaties
which call for the intrusive
monitoring of missile production
factories, challenge inspections of the
sites of suspected violations and on-
site inspectors to witness the
destruction of weapons. Vertic's role
is to investigate how this can best be
carried out. Three working groups
have been set up by the organisation
to discuss and collate information on
satellite remote sensing, seismic
monitoring and verification strategies.
An independent Oversight and
Advisory Committee presides to
oversee the work of the committees
before their conclusions are released
to the public.
Vertic receives a mixed reaction
from the Ministry of Defence and
those in Government. Dr Leggett
believes that civil servants
>Dr Lewis
occasionally use 'verification
difficulties' as a smoke screen for
political unwillingness to enter into
arms agreements. The Foreign Office
is more helpful, however, when it
comes to discussing the problems of
chemical weapons, which the USSR
possess and Britain does not. Political
barriers, though, occur at all levels;
'The sad thing about Vertic's
Parliamentary Seminars,' says Dr
Leggett, 'is that if a Tory is chairing
the meeting then Labour stay clear
and vice versa.'
The Vertic office can be found
above the 'Bonbon' restaurant in
Southampton Street off the Strand.
Patricia Lewis, a nuclear physicist
from Birmingham University, is
Vertic's full-time information officer.
She is assisted in her duties by Dave
Wooding, a voluntary researcher,
formerly a physics student at
Imperial. The group is supported
financially with a 3 year grant of
£80,000 from the Rowntree Trust and
Cadbury's.
At present Vertic has the resources
to collect and disseminate information
and to cover the expenses of arms
control experts for lectures and
briefing sessions. Next year,
however, the organisation will be
applying to a number of foundations
for funding for technical research into
verification techniques. Dr Leggett
believes that there is unsufficient
research being carried out in this area
and stresses the need for independent
research.
In Britain and the United States
verification research is carried out by
the weapons laboratories which
inevitably have to operate within the
policies of their respective
governments. 'This seems a bit like
entrusting the supervision of
prohibition to a group of alocoholics,'
says Dr Leggett. He believes that
there is a great scope for universities
to carry out work on verification.
Information freely available from
satellites—such as SPOT and
LANDSAT—-for example, can reveal
new missile silos, but no civilian work
is being carried out in this area nor
have British scientists been able to
find funding to take up the Soviet
invitation to install seismic monitoring
equipment around their nuclear
testing grounds.
Although universities in the United
States have departments specialising
in arms control and offer verification
courses, this is something British
universities shy away from. The fact
that the Official Secrets Act makes
gathering the appropriate information
more difficult-in this country, and a
British tendency to 'leave things to the
Government' may go some way to
explain their reluctance. Vertic has
been able to get around the problem
posed by the Secrets Act by making
use of experts from the United States;
under the American Freedom of
Information Act they are able to
divulge information which might be
regarded as sensitve in the UK.

Historic
Deals
For the first time in the history of
arms negotiations, the Superpowers
are on the verge of signing an accord
which will bring about the scrapping
of part of the nuclear stockpile. The
Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF)
accord, due for discussion on the 7th
December calls for the destruction of
all ground launched, intermediate
missiles, a total of some two thousand
warheads. These talks differ from
those of previous administrations in
one vital respect; both leaders are
anxious to reach a settlement. In the
following article, the Fifth Column
takes a look at the significance and
dangers of the INF deal, examines the
verfication problems it raises and
looks towards the deals which are
likely to follow in the wake of a
sucessful INF agreement.
On the face of it, the INF deal will
result in a reduction of only 4 % in the
world's nuclear stockpile. In practice,
it will lead to the removal of Cruise
and other medium range missiles
from Europe. If the negotiations
proceed as the United States would
wish, short range intermediate
missiles, with a range of 500 to 2500
km will be dismantled within a year
and the longer range missiles with
ranges upto 5000 km will go after
three years. Both sides have already
produced draft treaties which are in
close agreement and they are now
considering the fine details of the
accord. The omens look good for a
settlement.
Beyond INF lies the prospect of a
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START), but the prospects for
agreement are more tenuous. The
Soviet Union has put aside its qualms
