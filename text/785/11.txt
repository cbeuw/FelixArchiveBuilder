The FELLX
Student Survey
After an absence of
two years, FELIX
presents its

survey. The results
will be published in
two weeks with
comparisons
between this year
and 1985. How has
the 'average' IC
student changed?
Please take the time
to grab a sheet of
paper and answer
the questions
(truthfully). Send all
replies to FELIX
through the internal
mail (give envelopes

your answer sheet
so no need to fear
any repercussions
from your boy-
friend/girlfriend!
