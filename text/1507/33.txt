1. I shall not skip break-
fast again
You might have been told over and over
again about breakfast being important.
But it’s damn true: breakfast is the most
important meal of the day and without
it you’re like Justin Bieber without a
fringe.
People tend to miss breakfast either
because they’re in a rush or because
they think that this will help them lose
weight. Either way, lack of energy and
gain of weight will be the inevitable re-
sults.
When you wake up, your body has
been without fuel for about 8-9 hours
(for Imperial students, 5-6 hours). Re-
fueling properly will help you function
efficiently and perform as best as you
can.
2. I shall not waste food
No, I don’t mean to eat whatever you
have in your fridge and cupboards
before it expires. You should always
buy based on your needs (and wants).
Never overdo it. Make a list of things
you need and stick to it once you enter
the doors of the super market. Offers
may be tempting but you are a good
boy/girl and have a resolution to ful-
fill. Try it and see for yourself; you’ll
end up spending less money and your
fridge won’t get this weird smell that
you never want to find the source of.
3. I shall not visit the
minimarket
The corner shop can destroy you
health-wise. There are plenty of rea-
sons to avoid a visit: it’s more ex-
pensive than super markets; it offers
less choice; and you usually end up
buying crap like biscuits, crisps, soft
drinks and chocolate bars. I’m not
telling you to give up chocolate, that
would be a crime! However, it’s not
hard to realise that once you enter the
local store you will leave with things
you certainly didn’t want to buy be-
fore you went in. Keep it only for
emergencies...
4. I shall drink more
wine...
...responsibly.
Wine has a strong personality other
drinks don’t have. Whether you’re hav-
ing steak, chicken, fish, pasta, or even
just a salad, a glass of the appropriate
wine does make a difference. Do your
research, compare prices, and you will
see that the options are limitless.
5. I shall grill, not fry
Fried chicken, fried bacon, fried sau-
sages, fried eggs. You gotta love ‘em.
However, it’s 2012 and this is a reso-
lution to be respected. Grilled food is
generally healthier than fried. When
you fry food in butter or vegetable
oils you receive a big amount of extra
saturated and trans fat, both of which
are no good.
On the other hand, when you grill
food, chances are you will use a
marinara instead of other sauces to
give taste which is again healthier.
Also, excess fat will slip through the
grooves in the grill compared to the
fry-pan where all the fat stays (and
makes the food delicious).
6. I shall take advantage
of my family
Make a list of meals you can’t cook
by yourself either because you’re in-
competent or just because you “can’t
be bothered” but your mother, sister,
grandmother or anyone else in your
family do well. Once the term ends and
relief hits you what better than enjoy
hot, fat, homemade food?
7. I shall cook more
Cooking can be very creative and most
importantly it can be stress relieving.
Following or even creating your own
recipe makes you forget anything out-
side the kitchen. Presenting and tasting
your dish will fill you with a feeling of
pride and happiness.
Try baking a cake. Decorate it. Show
it to your friends, maybe offer them a
piece or two. Enjoy it in the morning
with coffee, tea or milk.
Tip: Try new recipes: attempt to make
it lighter by using fewer eggs and less
butter, or even no eggs at all. Avoid ic-
ing and other toppings; they will just
fatten the cake without adding any spe-
cial taste. Use fresh or compote fruits,
like strawberries and pinneapple.
Once you have perfected your cake
send your recipe at food.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk.
8. I shall go out
Let’s face the facts: Firstly, you live in
London. Secondly, you study in South
Kensington. Go out! Once every week or
fortnight visit a restaurant you’ve been
thinking about. The choice is yours. Ital-
ian, French, American, Greek, Chinese,
Turkish; the choices are unlimited.
Gather your friends and have a nice din-
ner out... now that you have time – May
is not far away!
9. I shall have a full
fridge
No, I don’t mean hitting the supermar-
ket, spending £100 and filling up your
fridge. Keep your fridge ‘updated’ with
healthy foods. Always have milk, fruits,
vegetables, mustard (which is low in fat),
low fat cheese (e.g. mozzarella), eggs
etc. That way, even if you get back from
college late at night, or you’re too bored
to go to the supermarket, you won’t get
into the temptation of ordering a delivery
and making a snack with what you have.
Tip: Fill your fridge every once or twice
a week according to your diet and needs
and try to have it emptied by the end of
the week. Your goal is to receive the cor-
rect amount of fruits, vegetables, milk
and other foods you always neglect to
get.
10. I shall contribute to
the Food Section

sions? Got something to share with

ber one Food Section writer of Felix?

2012: A Food Odyssey
Michael Krestas shares his top ten resolutions for a healthier, tastier year!
Ingredients
For the cake
2½ cups all purpose flour
4 tbsp corn flour
1½ tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
²/³ tsp salt
²/³ cup sunflower oil
1 cup sugar
2 cups soy milk
2 tsp white wine vinegar
4 tsp pure vanilla extract
For the filling
1 cup strawberries
¼ cup sugar
½ tsp vanilla extract
For the icing
2 tbsp water
1 cup powdered sugar
Preheat the oven at 180 °C. Oil a 22cm
round cake tin (preferably one with a
hole in the middle, as this makes the
cake easier to decorate).
In a bowl mix together the soy milk
and the vinegar. After 2 minutes add the
oil, vanilla extract and sugar. In a sepa-
rate bowl mix all the dry ingredients.
Then, add the liquid mixture in the bowl
with the dry ingredients. Mix until just
combined. Do not overmix.
Place half of the cake batter in the cake
tin. In a small bowl combine the filling
ingredients and then place them in the
cake tin. On top of the filling pour the
rest of the batter. Bake for about 40 min-
utes or until you insert a toothpick and
comes out dry. Let it cool for at least 15
minutes before removing it from the tin.
To make the icing mix the sugar with
the water. Decorate the cake with the ic-
ing and some strawberries.
