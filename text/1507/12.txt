COMMENT
Another week sees another potential clo-
sure by College. Hot on the heels of an on-
going campaign for the continuation of the
Holland Club, many have responded to the
news of the possible closure of Clayponds
halls of residence in South Ealing, with a
consensus that the loss of such an estab-
lishment would be detrimental to the Col-
lege community.
Yet the news of the closure surfaced
through rumour, with the Rector himself pro-
viding an official response to a postgradu-
ate’s concerns via email. Is it acceptable
for postgraduates to be informed about the
reasoning behind such a decision in this
manner? Indeed, the matter here is the rep-
resentation of the student, and of others in
residence at Clayponds, and how it could
be handled with, perhaps, more sensitivity
towards their needs..
The fact that Clayponds residents have
readily contested the plans in defence of
the Clayponds “community”, even before
confirmation of the intended closure of
the site, suggests that the handling of
the views of postgraduates was not han-
dled nearly as well as it could have been.
College may have appeared to have taken
the decision without fully appreciating the
channels that exist; channels that take into
account the opinions of perhaps, a wider
variety of students who could provide valua-
ble information and opinion, as indeed they
have done in correspondence with this very
newspaper.
One such channel is the Student Union.
Comments made by Union President Scott
Heath accentuate the “disappointment” in
the fact that the Union has so far had no
say on any of the plans. It is hard to disa-
gree that an entire lack of consultation may
not be the best course of action when such
a matter affects a significant proportion of
the student body.
And then there is the very real concern of
affordability of Imperial’s new postgraduate
accommodation – Imperial West at Wood
Lane and Griffon Studios in Clapham. The
Rector has outlined a bursary scheme for
those who choose to live here next academ-
ic year, but when you offer students money
to live in accommodation, do you really
have the pricing right? Imperial must pro-
vide affordable accommodation for its stu-
dents and there is a distinct worry amongst
those who have contacted Felix that the
end of Clayponds will mean the end of af-
fordable accommodation. Now is the time
for College to listen closely to those likely
to be affected by the closure of Clayponds,
and to ensure that feasible postgraduate
accommodation is in place for the immedi-
ate future.

Voice of Clayponds must
be heard by College
I
’ve been helping out at interview
days this year. Normally this is
a task I avoid in the same way
I avoid slapping my own balls
with a wooden paddle – that is,
by not agreeing to do it when I’m asked
by my superiors (it happens more than
you’d think). However, this year I am
short on money and, like all people
short on money, I am not averse to a
little ball-slapping in return for cash.
Interview days at Imperial have
all the atmosphere of a funeral, with
worse quality food. The interviewers
are miserable because they could be
off somewhere writing down equa-
tions. The interviewees are miserable
because they want to go to Cambridge
instead. And I’m miserable because
it’s a fucking Wednesday and I’m
standing around in a gaudily-lit box of
a room wondering what kind of cater-
ing department can do Hoi Sin duck
wraps and falafel but somehow fail to
do, say, cheese sandwiches.
I mean I love duck, it’s just – cheese
sandwiches, guys. How hard would
that be?
It’s on days like this that I see evi-
dence of everything that is wrong with
how we treat sixth-formers, both as a
university and a nation. It’s not just
that we under-fund their education and
then complain when they’re not up to
scratch. It’s the sheer amount of pres-
sure we pour on them – you’d think
they had a life expectancy of about
thirty years. They’re so focused on
what this decision will mean for the
rest of their life that they seem to for-
get just how much life they have left
to live. I know people who have done
three degrees and changed career four
times. Yet people are captivated by the
idea that if you don’t get into Impe-
rial you might as well top yourself,
because there’s no way in hell you’re
going to leave Birmingham otherwise.
As much as I love Imperial, I feel
it contributed about as much to my
overall education as many other insti-
tutions would have done. People seem
to think that enthusiastic, motivated
and talented educators are only able to
exist inside the walls of Cambridge,
Oxford or Imperial, and that the at-
mospheric composition of places like
Southampton or York or Edinburgh
causes anyone with half a brain to as-
phyxiate. Merely thinking of entering
a university that isn’t in the top ten
of one league table or another causes
your IQ to drop by eighty points.
You know as well as I do that, while
we’re blessed with some excellent
people at Imperial and some good fa-
cilities, careers aren’t made or broken
simply by the name on your degree
(unless you’re in the proportion of Im-
perial’s population who want as much
as possible for as little effort as can
be gotten away with, in which case
feel free to choke on your own tongue
next time you’re knocking back vi-
als of baby tears or whatever you do
for fun). You’re the one responsible
for securing your future, and that can
be done almost anywhere if you’re
willing to put forth the effort. That’s
Rejection isn’t the end of
the world
Stock photo of an interview, or some seriously niche porn? You decide...
why it’s important that sixth-formers
spend the time choosing their subject
for university, rather than the institu-
tion. Talking to a lot of the interview-
ees, however, I’m left with a very dif-
ferent impression.
Maybe that’s alright, or unavoid-
able, or not anyone’s fault at all. I
doubt it, somehow. Imperial’s past
Rectors have often tried their best to
elevate Imperial’s status, to make it
equal to Oxford or Cambridge as if
this will make it a better university
simply because people think it is. The
most interesting researchers I’ve met
this year were working out of Essex,
and they seemed perfectly content
with their position in life. I imagine it
rubs off on students as well.
We chuckle about how we over-
work ourselves here, but it’s less
funny to watch first-years weep into
textbooks every May – and those are
the ones who managed to get in. The
sixth-formers that are dreading every
morning’s post right now are honestly
harming themselves by stressing over
these interviews and decisions that
they somehow perceive as major life
choices.
Coming to Imperial might change
your life, of course. But most likely
you’ll still be the same person you
were beforehand. If, like me, you’re
working at an interview day this year,
try to impress this on those who turn
up – that while Imperial is a fine place
to be, it’s not a magic bullet, and a re-
jection from us is not a curse on your
every decision from hereon out.
It won’t make any difference, of
course, because no-one is listening to
you on interview day. But do it any-
way. I’ll appreciate it.
