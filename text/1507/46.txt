Off-target! Such a rare occurence in foil
Fencers building on success
in anticipation of weekend
Women’s 2nds dispatch Portsmouth 1sts with ease
Fencing
Helen Pennington
On Wednesday, the Women’s 2nd Fencing
Team played, and won, the fifth competition in
their league, leaving them in third place with a
total of three wins and two losses. The compe-
tition was the first one of the term, and saw a
confident team facing Portsmouth’s First Team
at home.
The match began with foil, in which Jenifer
Mizen (Jenny), Stephanie Martinez (Steph)
and Elanor Oakley (Elsa) fought valiantly. The
lead fluctuated between the two teams, with
the scores remaining close until Jenny gained
10 points in one match, disheartening the other
team and giving a lead of 8 points, which Steph
and Else improved upon to win 45-35.
Following foil the team fenced sabre, during
which Helen Pennington, Slavina Georgieva
(Slavi) and Jing Quek (Jingles) did not lose a
single match, winning 45-29. Finally, with their
opponents thoroughly disheartened, and only
needing 19 points to win, the women’s team
fenced epee. Rebecca Razzey (Becky), Helen
and Slavi only lost one out of the nine matches
between them, and defeated their opponents
45-35, giving Imperial a triple-weapon-win
with a total score of 135-99 - Portsmouth had
not even managed to reach triple figures.

Men’s and women’s 1sts prepare for premiership clashes

long we take) to decide what routine to do,
Pappity-boopity-poppity slotted in following
Aquaman’s entirely intentional (not at all a
scuffed shot) dummy.
If the first goal was good, the second goal
was better. The same routine left St Bart’s
stunned again. This time, Munter Gatherer’s
pass pierced through the defence, leaving
Aquaman with a simple touch into the goal.
2-0 the score, and it was no more than what
IC deserved.
The third goal was something else altogeth-
er. A loose ball popped out from Designer V
and Fresher Ed played a Cook-esque straight
drive that crashed in off the post. A stunning
goal and a stunning finish to the match.
It should be noted that victories always start
with the defence, and Fritzl, Eager Beaver,
B. Tablet, Free Willy and Gingypops had an
outstanding game.
Well done to the whole team, and here’s to
hoping they can stay on top for a while...
P.S. At no point, did Kirby score. Ever.

The Imperial fencing men’s and women’s
teams stand to win their respective leagues
this weekend, the men’s and women’s South-
ern Premiership, if they can fight off the likes
of Oxford, Cambridge, and London rivals
such as Queen Mary or ULU.
The women’s team currently stand top of
the southern premiership, having won all of
their matches in the previous weekend tour-
nament held in Cambridge. Their closest
competition is Oxford, who won three out of
four. Nevertheless, the girls registered a con-
vincing win against the dark blues last time
round, and expect to do so again this week-
end. Captained by ISE undergrad Charlotte
Levin, and featuring GB hopeful and Sports
scholarship athlete Hannah Bryars, the team
hope to defend last year’s crown success-
fully.
The men face a slightly more challenging
task, but are still feeling confident they can
come top of the league. They currently stand
in second place, having lost to Oxford in the
first weekend tournament by a single hit.
Captain Didier Nohlmans, a Physics PhD
student, believes they can definitely beat
Oxford (and the rest of the teams) this time,
which would ensure the IC contingent finish
in first place. The men’s team are buoyed by
the strength of their sabreurs Maiyuran Rat-
neswaran and Henry Gann, 6th and 12th re-
spectively in the GB rankings.
If both teams retain their league titles, it
will be another feather in the cap of the Impe-
rial fencing club, currently the most success-
ful in the country – both the women’s and
men’s 1st are defending BUCS champions.
The matches will take place in Ethos on
Saturday and Sunday; come down and sup-
port the team! Don’t mess with the guy with the sabre
