Clayponds in crisis

Residents speak out over plans to close postgraduate halls
Students have expressed their concern at
the planned closure of postgraduate hall
of residence Clayponds, with Imperial
College Union President Scott Heath
expressing his “disappointment” at an
alleged lack of communication between
the College and the Union with regards
to the College’s decision.
Clayponds, located in South Ealing, is
a student housing estate containing 136
houses and flats and providing accom-
modation for 325 postgraduate students.
Like undergraduate halls of residence,
Clayponds has its own wardening team,
and social and sporting activities are
regularly organised for its residents.
The wardening team was made aware
of the College’s intention to close Clay-
ponds in December, leading to current
and past residents expressing their con-
cern at such a decision. An email sent
directly to Rector Sir Keith O’Nions
by subwarden Craig Court resulted in
a personal response confirming the aim
to close Clayponds, while outlining the
reasoning behind the decision.
Mr Craig’s email placed emphasis on
the affordability of Clayponds, claiming
that new postgraduate accommodation
such as Clapham’s Griffon Studios or
Imperial West appeals to “a completely

Rector takes pay cut amidst university pay rises
Sophia David
An examination of thirteen of the
UK’s top universities’ financial state-
ments from 2010-11 has revealed that
their leaders earned an average salary
of £333,000, with an average pay rise
of £9,700.
The highest paid was Professor An-
drew Hamilton, vice-chancellor of
Oxford University, who received a to-
tal pay packet of £424,000. The vice-
chancellors of Oxford, Cambridge,
Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds, Not-
tingham, Bristol and Southampton all
received a pay rise.
These latest pay rises come amidst
a squeeze in university budgets in the
last year with £215m cut from teach-
ing budgets and £142m cut from capi-
tal project budgets used for new build-
ings and developments. They have
prompted calls for the government’s
crackdown on excessive executive
pay to be extended to universities.
Meanwhile, some vice-chancellors
did take a pay cut including the rec-
tor of Imperial, Sir Keith O’Nions.
However, O’Nions remains the third
highest-paid vice chancellor, receiv-
ing a total pay packet of £354,000.
A further six employees at Imperial
were also listed as having earned over
£270,000 in 2010-11, compared to
three the year before.
Sally Hunt, general secretary of the
University and College Union, com-
mented that the average salary of uni-
versity leaders was “eye-wateringly
high”, particularly since lecturers
have faced a 7% real-terms pay cut
since 2009.
