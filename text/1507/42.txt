If you’d like to contribute by sending in puzzles, comics or even
some editing, e-mail puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Be they hor-
rendously complicated things or funky picture puzzles you think
readers would like, do get in touch. General suggestions are
also welcome.
Contributions wanted!
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed loop
by connecting the dots. The num-
bers in each square indicate how
many edges of the square are part
of the loop, so if it contains a
“2”, you know that two and only
two out of four edges have lines.
That’s all the info you need to get
the one logical answer (though
waiting a week to see the solution
will also do). Answers to puzzles.
felix@imperial.ac.uk, as the
puzzles team recieves a little Jan-
uary blues per correct solution.
