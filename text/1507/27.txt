FILM
God Help The Girl builds on from a
musical project by Stuart Murdoch (of
Belle and Sebastian fame) that resulted
in a set of EPs and an album of the
same name in 2009. The tracks intro-
duce the story of Eve, a girl with much
promise and a bright future, whose life
falls apart – culminating with a long
stay in hospital. It is an album with a
sad story to tell, yet does so in a mind-
numbingly beautiful manner. Whilst
based on Stuart’s band, the songs have
an extra punch, making them sound
wonderful. Whether this is thanks to
the orchestra that Stuart makes excel-
lent use of, or the outstanding voices
of Catherine Ireton et al., is left to per-
sonal choice.
Following the releases, Stuart joins
with Barry Mendel, who produced the
six-time Academy Award-nominated
The Sixth Sense, to release a film, ex-
plaining what happens to Eve after her
departure from hospital. Stuart always
knew there was a story to tell with God
came to his head in 2003.
The film is funded by a combina-
tion of private and public funding,
with a target of $3m set. The Channel
4 Alpha Fund has contributed, with
some “financially blessed individuals”
worldwide making their own private
contributions. One of the more inter-
esting funding mechanisms that the
team have undertaken is through use of
Kickstarter – a website where people
pledge to a project and receive gifts in
return. Subject to the goal of $100,000
being met, pledgers can expect a wide
variety of strange and exciting prizes,
including pieces of the set, one-of-a-
kind rarities, and appearances in the
film. This is in addition to other fan-
led initiatives, such as website visitors
suggesting people to be considered for
casting.
God Help The Girl is looking to be
a particularly exciting film, even if we
only know little of the storyline at the
moment. The plot that we have seen is
deep and intriguing, and the musical
accompaniment from the earlier re-
leases only helps to develop it further,
as well as build anticipation of an ex-
cellent soundtrack. Definitely a film to
keep an eye on as it develops further
this year!
An exciting new musical project
Help The Girl – he started writing the
screenplay in 2006.
Beyond what we learn from the mu-
sic, plot details are thin on the ground.
However, the character profiles carry
on where the album left off, and give
us a glimpse into what we can expect
to see when the film is released. The
story is set in Glasgow around Eve and
two new characters, James and Cassie,
in what the promotional videos call
“the story of a better summer”. In other
words, this is the tale of three people
whose lives revolve around music.
Eve, as a character, is a wreck. Over-
whelmed by the pressure of a Univer-
sity education for which she has little
regard, she becomes insular, isolated
from her parents and friends, and an-
orexic. Her parents, horrified, send her
to hospital. It is here that the film picks
up, focusing on how she builds herself
back through music. It is highly likely
that this is after Eve runs off after a
hospital football match – this is where
the story in the album ends.
James is also of poor health, but ap-
pears to have more life in his soul than
Eve did when she was at hospital. An
EP suggests that Eve is fond of James
(whom she met at the end of the story
in the album), and like Eve, James
Time to play casting-director: the above female looks like a cross between Audrey Tautou, Rooney Mara, and....hmm... Isabella Rossellini (for the hair)

God Help the Girl is someone who has music flowing
through his veins. This is not the only
thing they have in common – his health
problems also appear to be of the men-
tal type, with the character profile
describing him as spending as much
time as possible in his “safety zone”, a
“small bedsit room”.
Cassie, on the other hand, is vastly
different to the other two characters.
Her profile describes her as “posh”,
living in a castle; yet also having a
bubbly personality. Her connection to
the others is seen at the start of the film
– being taught the guitar by James in
a “stilted”, “professional” relationship,
while the song ‘I’ll Have To Dance
With Cassie’ may give some sugges-
tion as to her standing with Eve! With
that said, her lack of friends (the sug-
gestion is due to her awkward posh
background) results in her spending the
majority of her time with the others.
The film is to be recorded this year
in Glasgow with Stuart in the direc-
tor’s chair. Once casting is complete
and funding attained, filming can begin
in earnest, with a release expected in
2013. The speed of the production is
aided by the existence of a complet-
ed score and script – Stuart has been
working on this project since songs
