Average pay rise of £10,000 for
University leaders
revealed that vice-chancellors and
other senior staff claimed a total of
approximately £700,000 in expenses
in 2010-11, a drop from £883,000 the
previous year.
Usman Ali, vice-president of the
National Union of Students, also com-
mented, “When students are facing
trebled tuition fees and massive youth
unemployment, and as universities
deal with swingeing cuts to teaching
budgets, it is appalling that university
heads continues to fill their boots.”
Vice-chancellors’ salaries are usu-
ally determined by remuneration
committees that most often do not in-
clude other employees. Hunt said, “I
think there is a very strong argument
for employee and student representa-
tives to sit on university remuneration
boards. It is vital that we ensure there
is proper scrutiny of vice-chancellors’
pay and pension provision.”

Driving Lessons For Imperial Students
“Denis is a fantastic teacher and knows how to get people from completely
inexperienced and utterly hopeless driving up to the standard to pass their test.
He is always calm and his comments are constructive; his knowledge of London
and his knack of engineering driving routes that test the learner make the lessons
more than worth it. Since I have met him he has shown a great desire to offer
cheaper lessons to Imperial students and with the backing of other students
I am more than happy to support him”
- Alex Kendall, IC Union President 2010-11

Meanwhile, Nicola Dandridge,
chief executive of Universities UK,
said the remuneration packages “re-
flected what it takes to recruit and re-
tain individuals able to run complex,
multimillion-pound organisations,
which are operating in an increasingly
competitive, global market.”
