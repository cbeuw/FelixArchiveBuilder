After a nice, long (but not long enough)
Christmas break, your Felix Sport cap-
tains’ interviews are back! This week,
two lovely ladies from Netball: Lucie
Hazell, Club Captain, and Feroza Kas-
sam, Club Treasurer.
Felix Sport: Netball is one of those
clubs which always has a pretty
strong turnout, and plenty of teams.
How big is the club?
Feroza Kassam: We have four com-
petitive teams, and one social team,
for about sixty members. The club
has definitely grown since last year,
though..
FS: What kind of netballing expe-
rience do you guys have?
FK: I’ve been playing at uni since
my first year, but there’s a bit of a sto-
ry behind it...I accidentally signed up
for the medics in fresher’s fair! I only
switched back after a year. I got into
netball at school, though.
Lucie Hazell: I only started in my
second year, actually. I hadn’t played it
since I was fourteen, but once I got into
it I just got more and more competitive,
and now I’m club captain!
FS: What do you find appealing
about netball, as opposed to, say,
basketball?
FK: It’s faster-paced than people
think it is, even though you can’t move
when you hold the ball.
LH: If you’re being serious about it,
it can become a very tactical game...
You can appreciate people not seeing
the appeal from the outside, most guys
don’t get it either but once you start
playing it’s actually loads of fun.
FS:Speaking of guys, should they
ever be allowed to play netball?
LH:You’d have to make the posts
higher! I don’t see why not though.
FS:Maybe mixed netball?
FK:I think England netball organise
discovery sessions which let guys try
out netball.
LH:We had “Fun day” last year,
where a few guys played, and we orga-
nise a grudge match every year against
the rugby club – although like I said,
the posts are too short for them, so they
get an unfair advantage!
FS:What leagues do you play in?
FK:Both BUCS and ULU. The 1s are
doing really well this year, as they are
second of their division!
FS:That’s pretty good – how often
do you train, and what does it in-
volve?
LH:We train once a week, two hours,
all together. Our coach used to play
netball for imperial, and she’s doing a
great job for all levels. We start off with
some fitness, and then do drills with the
ball, and then practice matches. The
drills are good for all levels, especially
the people who have never played be-
fore – we have quite a lot this year!
FS:So the club is growing nicely
then?
FK:Yes, I think particularly this year:
we had a lot of people at fresher’s fair
coming up to us saying they’d never
played before, which wasn’t really
the case in previous years. This year
there is a new committee, and I feel
the dynamic of the club is changing a
bit, becoming more open. There was a
feeling in previous years that the whole
thing was a bit elitist, with the commit-
tee members all from the higher teams,
and the first team captain would be
club captain too. It’s not necessarily a
bad thing, because it gives a very com-
petitive edge to the club, but I think it
did put some beginners off.
FS:Just to clarify, which team do
you play for, Lucie?
The thirds! So the club mindset has
changed somewhat, in that sense.
FS:You also mentioned a ‘social
team’ – what is that exactly?
LH:Well, it’s for the people who don’t
want to play on a BUCS team, or who
just want to enjoy themselves – I’d say
the majority of the club is made up of
the 4th and 5th teams (the 5th team be-
ing the social team – Ed.) We’re trying
to get the 5th team into ULU next year,
but at the moment the team captain has
just organising informal matches. The
Royal College of Music are starting up
a team, so we play them, as well as the
RSM.
FS:Speaking of playing other fac-
ulties, let’s have your thoughts on
varsity! Any aims for this year? How
did it go last year?
FK:I think we have a good chance

this year…We won two out of five last
year, which was amazing, a really good
result. We’re really happy if we win
any match, because all the equivalent
medic teams are a league above ours.
The 1s are doing really well this year,
though, and we think they have the po-
tential to beat the medics, so…fingers
crossed!
LH:The matches are on a whole dif-
ferent level in varsity, though; we play
medics in our leagues all the time but
when it comes to varsity it’s a com-
pletely different situation!
FS:Finally, how is the social side of
the club? Are you quite active?
The club this year is a lot more social
than it has been, we’re going on tour to
Salou, in Spain for the first time ever,
at Easter –twenty-five girls bussing it
down. The social secs this year are do-
ing a great job, we’ve had a curry night
and a Christmas dinner so big we had
to change the venue! We also try and
come to the union every Wednesday,
and have a good turnout. I think it’s
important that everyone gets to know
each other.
