R
evolution! With its impas-
sioned rhetoric and gritty
anger the Occupy move-
ment is intent on over-
hauling democracy as
we know it. Bitter, disaffected people
around the world are answering Oc-
cupy’s call, and governments are be-
ginning to pay attention to the voice of
the disillusioned masses!
Reading preachy propagandistic
non-journalism like the above para-
graph makes me crush my glass of
whisky in disgust and want to go on
hunger strike until critical thinking
lessons are given to all children of all
ages until they’re so sceptical they end
up believing nothing at all.
Yet this is what we have to deal with:
a right-wing press that unilaterally
dismisses anything remotely Occupy-
related with allegations of drug abuse,
defecation on Church property, and
general rowdiness. In addition, we
have a much smaller left-wing press
that prints youthful, idealistic tripe and
worships at the feet of Occupy as if it
the best thing to have happened to so-
cialism since the welfare state was first
conceived.
This pseudo-debate is like listening
to two people debating over an orange:
one thinks it exhibits behaviour typical
of a banana while the other believes it
is a wonderful example of an apple.
Both sides are talking out of their el-
bows, and it bores me senseless.
I will not waste many valuable
words explaining what is wrong with
the conservative side of the ‘debate’.
There can be few people in Britain
today who don’t think the right-wing
press is the two-faced mistress of the
upper classes, a Conservative propa-
ganda machine with a thinly-veiled
sprinkling of islamophobia.

Why you should give me your money
Occupy the New Year, but grow up first
The left-wing press is usually slight-
ly more subtle and discerning in its
opinions, but with Occupy it comes
across as a schoolboy with a crush: the
Occupy movement can do no wrong.
Photos of Guy Fawkes masks accom-
pany the anticipation of an approach-
ing revolution. The Government must
listen to the voice of its people! We are
the 99%!
Leaving aside the dubious statistical
nature of “the 99%”, what I really want
to address is the idea of revolution. To
young idealists like myself and the
members of Occupy, revolution can
seem exciting and liberating: who
hasn’t imagined themselves as a Brit-
ish Che Guevara, motorcycling down
the streets of a burnt-out London, ciga-
rette in mouth, awaiting the symbolic,
V-for-Vendetta-style explosion of Big
Ben?
But has it really come to this? Do
we really need a masked vaudevillian
veteran or an angry Venezuelan medi-
cal student to save us from our authori-
tarian overlords? Of course not. The
fact that I can write here that ‘David
Cameron feasts daily on the bloodied
corpses of children’ without getting
arrested is proof of that (though if I
mysteriously stop writing articles af-
ter this, you’ll know that Britain has in
fact slipped into a North Korean night-
mare).
Occupy is about bringing back de-
mocracy and returning complete con-
trol of the government to the people
who elect them. And whatever revo-
lution is, it is not democratic – it is,
in fact, fairly totalitarian, since it in-
volves forcing a single ideology on an
entire population. This is fine in Egypt
or Libya where the situation is beyond
horrific, but not here.
I think I’m justified in saying that
I
’m going to lay my cards out
on the table straight away. I
will spend the next six months
begging you for money. This
is the raison d’etre of this col-
umn. Amusing you (or more likely
myself) would be a nice perk on the
side – a bit like dental insurance.
Given that you are all, no doubt,
very lovely, very deep pocketed peo-
ple with enormously generous student
loans, I’m sure that you’re already
reaching for your cheque books. It
only seems fair, therefore, that I justi-
fy you handing me large wads of cash.
So here it is: I’m taking part in an
Ironman triathlon. The iron distance
is a 2.4 mile swim followed by a 112
mile cycle followed by a 26.2 mile
run (a marathon). Now I was never
in the ‘gifted athlete’ bracket growing
up, but then again I was never the last
to be picked when choosing football
teams either. I have mid-table me-
diocrity written all over me. I’m the
Middlesbrough of sporting prowess.
This is slightly unfortunate, because
even if I were incredibly marvellous
and could give Mo Farah a run for
his money, an Ironman later this year
would still be gooch-achingly diffi-
cult.
So I guess this begs the question
“why?” Well, simply put, (and this is
where it gets a little heavy), my cous-
in suffers from Cystic Fibrosis and
I’m raising money for the CF Trust in
the hope that the research they fund
will save her life.
CF is a recessive genetic disease. 1
in 25 people are carriers of the gene
(often unaware of the fact) and 1 in
2500 suffer from the full blown ill-
ness. It mainly affects the lungs – in
later stages it’s so difficult to breathe
that it feels like you’re sucking air
through a straw. The median life ex-
pectancy is 35.
My cousin is waiting for a lung
transplant. If she gets one, it will radi-
cally change her life for the better, but
most people don’t want a revolution,
or, to phrase it less controversially, a
“complete overhaul of democracy”.
It is the everyday concerns (Will the
buses still run? Who will pay the win-
ter fuel allowance? Will the police still
be on duty? Will I still be able to fund
my alcoholism on the Disability Liv-
ing Allowance I’m fraudulently claim-
ing from the government?) that make
revolution – for lack of a better phrase
– a terrible idea.
The system of Government clearly
needs to be changed; anyone with
half a brain can see that. But it is es-
sential that it is changed from within,
by getting elected and passing legisla-
tion through Parliament. Any other ap-
proach is hypocritical and dangerous.
As a new approach in this New Year,
Occupiers and Occupy-supporters
should join and vote for the Green Par-
it won’t cure her. She’ll be OK for 10
years or so, but much more money is
needed for research before a perma-
nent fix can be found.
So that is why I’m doing an Iron-
man. I want to inspire people to give
a few pennies to a cause that is very
close to my heart. Any amount counts
– and it will be incredibly gratefully
received.

Occupy is
absolutely right
in its motives, but
completely wrong
in its methods
“
Occupy
Occupy
absolu
absolu
ty: a party with near-identical policies
to Occupy, but with less stigma and
– importantly – an MP in Westmin-
ster. The Green Party should debate
strongly with other large parties and
repeatedly make the point that none
of the other 3 main parties in England
will make the sweeping changes that
are needed.
With Lib Dem popularity at an all-
time low, the Green Party should pick
up a few more seats in the next elec-
tion. Then, and only then, does Occupy
have the power and legitimacy to pres-
sure the government into changing the
system.
In short: Occupy is absolutely right
in its motives, but completely wrong
in its methods. The left-wing press
should take heed of this – a schoolboy
crush is a cruel thing, and it will only
end in tears.
Can you first figure out how to use an apostrophe please
