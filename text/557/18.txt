CIRCUS
O u t s i d e t h e A l b e r t H a l l ,
Iranian students, a n d a pro-
Khomeini mullah kept up their
incessant chant stamping their
feet and waving their fists. " W e
are s o l d i e r s of K h o m e i n i ! " .
" L o n g live K h o m e i n i " , they
shouted.
A young man with a meg-
a p h o n e d e l i v e r e d a r u n n i n g
lecture on the iniquities of the
CIA, of the distortions of the
British Press,and the conduct of
the Iranian dissidents in the
Embassy, whom he rebuked for
not freeing the B B C hostages.
"Go home if you don't like it",
shouted a student at the edge of
the crowd. Another youth blew a
whistle like a football fan trying to
upstage the noise of the rival
supporters.
Inside the Police cordon was all
the paraphenalia of a travelling
circus. Vans, generators and
cables were everywhere. Much
uncollected litter swirled around
the area.

nearby flats vociferously com-

Radio car until 5 a.m. when the
newsmen returned. The demo-
nstrators increased the intensity
of their chanting .... the second
day of the siege had begun.
