Review of the FELIX Year *
T E R M T H E FIRST
T h e P a l m e r R e g i m e b e g a n u n d e r the
storm clouds of the " H i g h C o u r t D r a m a " .
S e i s m i c E x e c rifts, J o h n H a r r i s elder-
statesman comments and Richard Earl
playing games with his copy. Quadrophenia
made F E L I X Film O f The M o n t h (what
were the others?). A l s o mixed up in the
general confusion were the 'pernicious
a n t i - u n i o n v i e w s of F r a n k J a m e s ' , the
endless bickering over Steve Marshall's
Rag M a g and R S M playing rugby against
various people in the Mirror. The Exec
p a p e r e d o v e r t h e i r c r a c k s (?) w i t h a
u n i t e d front o n the O c c u p a t i o n w h i c h
provoked a Censure M o t i o n and a level
o f a n t i - E x e c muck-slinging that beat even
the vintage tussles of Barrett and Miller.
Letters
The Letters Page (and the o d d set of
captionable photographs) had by now all
b u t t a k e n o v e r F E L I X , a n d F E L I X
Committee was heard to press for more
'news'. Internal controversies continued
to dominate — the new L o r d B F shocked
many on C o m m e m D a y : '"ff IC is . . .
chosen to go . . ." A b d u l Salam clinched
his Laureate, and J Whitehouse.made P 5
distilling a 'vat of soup'. Fanshaw F L o v e
delivered a snide attack on the occupation,
while D e r r i c k Everett defended Steve M
as the only one prepared to handle the
R a g M a g a n d The Phoenix . F r a n k J
c l a i m e d not to o b j e c t to ' o r a n g e - j u i c e -
swilling people'. The I C U banner was torn
between the views of the Liberals and
F e m i n i s t s a n d S t e v e H u t c h i n g s w a s
dubbed a ' P - M a d - P ' for credit-watching
(but the Editor has always taken great
c a r e s i n c e ! ) . F o x , (in full g e a r ) , w a s
p i c t u r e d ' d i s c u s s i n g the c u t s ' w i t h his
c o l l e a g u e a n d m e n t o r , M a r y A , a n d
F E L I X became a literary battleground to
revive old grouses as U G M - r a i l r o a d e r s
came under fire. A s Rag W e e k loomed
( w i t h t h e f a i n t s p e c t r e of ' E n v i r o -
Stotesbury W e e k ' behind it), Phil C o l e
(who h a d p l e n t y of c r e d i b i l i t y at this
stage) appealed for shorter speeches at
U G M s (a d o o m e d idea wrecked by its
b e s p e c t a c l e d U G M p r o p o s e r ) . A l a n
B u r t o n defended his democratic quorum-
challenging rights as the P G Dinner failed
o w i n g to l a c k of a p p e t i t e . J a n C a n d
Short-Life Housing hit F E L I X while if you

R a c e s i n t h e B e i t Q u a d ( a n d o n i o n
munches on the front page) together with
the Beer Festival proved the new I C U
President certainly wasn't a pretty face,
w h i l e L e o ( N O B ) of R C S a p p e a r e d
covered in m u c k (obviously not moving
fast enough).
Knife Grinders' Weekly
" A n n a and M a r g e " offered 'counselling
sessions' on the constant need to table
p r o - a b o r t i o n m o t i o n s at U G M s , w h i l e
Frankie J and the lads found their public
images tarnished by a hostile Cambridge
University Challenge team. R C S ' s mascot
Jez at last repayed J o n Hall's years of
sleeping in a suit, by moving of her own
accord and the Ents films appeared in
random order on the centre pages. Roger
hoped his Enviro-week 'will excite you
sufficiently' and Fox's X V beat Townsend's
men by 24 to 6.
Colin Palmer
David Owen, one of the guest speakers during
Environmental Week.
M e a n w h i l e the S n o o k e r C l u b s c r i b e
(Dai Bach) shocked millions with his tales
of 'Sanshit's Nocturnal Emissions' and far
l e s s s a v o u r y c o m m e n t s . T h e E d i t o r
subsequently printed a heavily censored
complaint from D a i about shortening his
articles. Ladies' Rugby became established
a s N o 1 S p a c e - F i l l e r , a s t h e E A O
instructed the H o n Sec to 'pull his socks
up'.
Space Invasion
M a r k S m i t h p r e v i e w e d Star Trek The
MP, Apocalypse Now, Life Of Brian and
The Black Hole on a single page — the
30th Anniversary Issue came complete
with a realistic-looking editorial while Paul
Williams made F E L I X history by having
Drake's Seven's Supreme Galactic Rear
Flight Superintendent Bratt (Ms) appear
'unclothed'! Suddently, it's Christmas and
Fox becomes painfully jolly, overburdened
by ' H o - H o - H o ' Yuletide cynicism. M a l c o l m
vows to 'curl up and drink N e w k y B r o w n
all day' The catalytic young freshers, like
the w o r t h y ' A n n e a n d R o b i n ' of M r
Newland (remember Richard, the tiddly-
w i n k c h i l d m o l e s t e r ? ) say f a r e w e l l to

' e m o t i o n a l t u r m o i l a n d w a t e r s h e d s in
people's lives' — but no matter, the term
ends with a tear jerking editorial. " A n d so
this is X m a s — and what have we done?"
Ben Bourdillon
The Prime Minister donated £5 to IC Rag in
December.
The editor's digital watch says 6:10am.
S o o n the sun will be rising heralding the
start of a n o t h e r last m i n u t e T h u r s d a y
