LOCATION
The aerial photograph shows how
close the Iranian Embassy (1) was to
Imperial College. Weeks Hall (2) which
is at the back of the Embassy, was used
by P o l i c e M a r k s m e n w h o w e r e
positioned on the Hall roof.
The student demonstrations were
reported in the Press to have taken
place 'outside the Embassy'. However
their true location (3) was near t,ie
Albert Hall.
Many roads were closed near the
Embassy and the special photograph,
below, shows the front of the Iranian
Embassy (left hand side of the picture)
and Exhibition Road (on the right).
O n the sixth day the terrorists started to kill
the hostages a n d so the S A S went in. T h e
above photograph shows the front of the
Embassy building being blasted by stun
grenades thrown from the balcony by S A S
soldiers.
O n e S A S group came across the balconies in
the front of the building using portable scaling
ladders. Students in W e e k s Hall watched
another S A S group abseil d o w n ropes at the
back of the Embassy. T h e S A S broke through
the windows and lept in to seek out the
terrorists.
T h e dramatic action at the climax of the siege
was watched by millions of T V viewers. D u r i n g
the six days of the siege the Press brought in
specialised equipment. A Press M a r q u e e and a
grandstand of scaffolding (right photo) were
erected. T w o cranes carried the I T V a n d B B C
television cameras whose cameramen rapidly
became the 'stars' of the waiting game.
