Get the S A S "
The siege of the Iranian Embassy began on Wednesday 30th
April. The Embassy was so close to Imperial that it was inevitable
that IC students would get involved in the demonstrations which
took place during the siege.
Hundreds of IC students turned out to demonstrate against the
Ayatollah Khomeini and although for some the demonstration
was 'just a bit of fun', the Press duly reported our actions. The
Times wrote about our singing of Rule Britannia and rugby
songs and the fact that we brought along a piano to the lead the
singing.
The Sun said that the 'rowdy mobs of Iranians' were finally
silenced by a good old British sing-song which came from 150
mockers â€” boisterous students from the nearby Imperial
College in Kensington.
