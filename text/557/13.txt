O n Saturday 7th J u n e about
five hundred cyclists converged
on St Pauls Cathedral for the
R o u n d L o n d o n C y c l e R i d e ,
organised by the L o n d o n Cycling
Campaign. T h e cyclists visited
nine town halls to present their
d e m a n d s to the c o u n c i l s for
one percent of their transport
budgets to be spent on cycling
facilities. (Cyclists account for
over two percent of the total
traffic o n the roads of the city.)
T h e r i d e , w h i c h w a s o v e r
t w e n t y - f i v e m i l e s l o n g , c u l -
minated at C o u n t y Hall where
the demands were presented to
the leaders of the G L C . T h e
ride was not without incident
but was apparently enjoyed by
all who took part. W e are all
hoping for a favourable response
from the local authorities.

Got one or two bar glasses still lying
around?
Then why not take them back to the bar
where they belong? Every glass lost
means another which has to be bought,
leading to higher beer prices.
