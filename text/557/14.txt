With the end of exams (for most of you) and eventual
recovery from the celebrations you may be tempted to
view a few of the current film releases. Here's a brief look
at some of them.
FRIDAY T H E 13TH (X)
Rather appropriately, a n d with more than a little showmanship,
this horror feature is released tonight, with late shows at some
cinemas. Also, rather appropriately, it turns out to be a bit of a
disaster.
The plot centres o n a n A m e r i c a n summer camp which has
fallen into disuse following a series of unexplained murders. M a n y
years later a group of youths arrive to re-open it are met with
clich6d forbodings of death and d e s t r u c t i o n from an equally
cliched village idiot. It's not m u c h of a surprise when the kids are
despatched one by one in a series of gruelling and bloody ways.
Technically the gore is well done; the camera dwells on a young
man's throat as a knife is thrust through from behind, and a girl's
throat is slit and slowly opens in an all too realistic manner. T h e
effects certainly look convincing, but I personally found it about
as enjoyable as watching a dentist pull teeth. A v o i d it unless y o u
like gore.
THE WANDERERS (X)
Set in N e w Y o r k in the '60s, this amusing feature concerns the
e x p l o i t s of rival gangs, p r i m a r i l y ' T h e W a n d e r e r s ' a n d ' T h e
Baldies' — a group of huge bald-headed thugs lead by a giant
called Terror a n d his teenage girl. In a n ultimately pointless tale,
d i r e c t o r P h i l i p K a u f m a n m a n a g e s to w e a v e a thin plot a n d
enjoyable period music into a light-hearted a n d mildly satisfying
film. It's worth a few hours if you've nothing else to do.
THE G R E A T ROCK A N D ROLL SWINDLE (X)
By far the most intriguing, if not well-made, film I've seen recently
is this condensed epic which chronicles the brief legend of the
Sex Pistols. Fascinating froir^ the start, it whips u p a collection of
odd characters (Ronnie Biggs, Helen of T r o y and M a r y Millington
not to mention the Pistols themselves) into a story of r o c k
success, centring o n the commentary of their manager, M a l c o l m
M c L a r e n . If the hypocrisy doesn't bite at y o u then the bare-faced
c h e e k c e r t a i n l y will a n d y o u ' r e t e m p t e d to t h i n k that y o u
shouldn't have ever paid to see it. A t times it is riotously funny. I
enjoyed it immensely a n d would recommend it for a good night
out.
Finally, I'd like to mention Get Out Your Handkerchiefs which
is in its last week at the C u r z o n a n d The Tin Drum, both are
worth seeing for many reasons, not least that they're very funny
in places. N e x t week I shall preview Alan (Midnight Express)
Parker's new film Fame.
