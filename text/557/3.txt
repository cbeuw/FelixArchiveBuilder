A note by the Union Welfare Officer and ICWA
O n 9 t h J u n e from 11:00pm to 01:00pm
M e r c h e Clark a n d Pete Stevens toured
the College to see h o w many ways into
buildings, especially Halls, were unlocked,
o p e n , o r a c c e s s i b l e . T h e s t a n d a r d of
lighting o n walkways a n d roads was also
checked.
T h e r e s u l t s w e r e a p p a l l i n g . N e i t h e r
s u r v e y o r w a s t o o f a m i l i a r w i t h t h e
residences a n d yet numerous entrances
w e r e f o u n d . T h e s e r a n g e d f r o m d o o r s
wedged open through locked doors with
no glass in a window pane, to windows
open in every dark corner a n d by fire
e x i t s . T h e d e p l o y m e n t of t h e s e c u r i t y
guards was badly organised.
Just two a n d a half weeks after a girl
w a s r a p e d t h e s i t u a t i o n c o u l d e a s i l y
h a p p e n a g a i n . N o t e v e n t h e b a r e s t
temporary actions seems to have been
taken. A l l four lifts i n Southside still go to
the basement all night — this could have
b e e n c h a n g e d i m m e d i a t e l y a f t e r t h e
incident.
Note On Lights
Even in areas where there are sufficient
number of lights, some locations had fifty
p e r c e n t q u o t a of b r o k e n b u l b s . T h e
type of l i g h t i n g w a s i n a d e q u a t e . T h e
recessed tubes of the walkway only give
about thirty per cent efficiency due to the
shadow of the housing. A l l lights were
soft in colour and gave a diffuse, shadowy
light. It is possible to stand next to the
lights behind 170 Queen's G a t e a n d not
be seen due to the poor spread of light.
W e felt that a fewer number of standard
y e l l o w s o d i u m l a m p s m o u n t e d i n t h e
conventional street light form would be
far more effective.
Note O n Security
W e c o u l d n o t u n d e r s t a n d w h y t h e
Southside main entrance h a d two guards
and a messenger o n duty — all minding
their o w n b u s i n e s s —' w h i l e t h e B e i t
guard is expected to o c c u p y the archway
and patrol the building. C o u l d not o h e of
the Southside team patrol all the buildings
and still leave a guard at each door?
The detailed results of the survey have
not been published in F E L I X for obvious
reasons. C o p i e s have been sent to the
Rector a n d Captain J Lindley of Estates.
It is C a p t a i n Lindley's responsibility to
supervise security. In the wake of recent
events it would seem that C a p t a i n Lindley
has n o t c a r r i e d o u t h i s d u t i e s t o t h e
satisfaction of the U n i o n .

crippling disease. H e r husband has had to
give up his job to look after the family;
and living off Social Security leaves little
to pay for the high cost of the required
double ambulance journey to a n d from
E x m o u t h .
How Can You Help?
The I C R e d C r o s s ambulance is available
and willing to transport the family, if funds
can be found to pay for fuel, etc. W e
need about £150 to make these journeys
practicable. O n Wednesday we will be
