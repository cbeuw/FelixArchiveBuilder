IC CRICKET CLUB
vs
PRESIDENT'S XI
Sunday 9th, Hariington
Sunday was not the most successful
of days for Imperial College Cricket
Club. Neil Price lost the toss, the team
was narrowly beaten by the President's
XI and then came a close second to a
well-drilled RCS outfit in a team 'boat-
race'.
Crowe and Hurst opened the bowling
and their sheer pace soon had the
-President's XI in trouble. Hurstcunningly
switched to a spin attack midway
through his second over, but still no
wickets fell. The psychological damage
had been done though and Dean
came in to take a wicket with his first
ball. Chadwick rallied with a priceless
45 for the President's XI, as wickets
fell steadily at the other end. Weale
made a spirited 21, as Dean and
Crowe tore apart the remaining
batting, and the President's XI declared
at 136 for 8.
Tea was taken and Kenrick and
Brereton duly opened the batting.
Within half an hour both were out,
having obviously 'left the straight one'
to adjourn to the bar. Stantiford came
in and dominated for an hour with an
excellent 46. Price and Crowe batted
well to take the College to within 13
runs of the required total, with 2 overs
remaining.
By now Senkiw's bowling had begun
to make its mark and on the last ball
of the day the College needed 6 to win
with one wicket standing. With Crowe
facing, the President's XI were under-
standably concerned. Every fielder
was positioned on the boundary.
Senkrw raced in to bowl. Crowe lifted
his bat. The ball flew towards the
wicket. Crowe followed through. The
ball removed his middle stump.
Team: M Kenrick; G Brereton; P
Stantiford; P Slater; N Price (Capt); T
Hillyer; C Roche; I Crowe; D Price; B
Dean; A Hurst.
BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER
Shock! Horror! A snooker article!
There has been a certain lack of
communication this year between
FELIX and the Snooker Club (partly
our fault, partly FELIX's). I apologise
to all our members for the lack of
information about our events this
term.
The Committee for 1980/1 has been
elected, and the joint committee
meeting will be on Wednesday 18th
June at 1:00pm in the Union TV
Lounge.
The first team won the league again,
and we actually got a cup (which is
now on show in the Union Office). By
the way, snooker lessons are still to be
had: just come up, and we will arrange
a time (one person who took lessons
actually became a team member).
During the summer holidays, the
balls will be available from the Union
Office (Union cards are required).
The major change in the Club this
year, to my mind, was that the 'A'
(team) table is now available when no
team members are present. Therefore,
if the table is free do not hesitate to
start a frame: team members have to
let you finish a frame once you have
started it. Finally, I would like to
congratulate all members of the Club
who received Colours (social, athletic,
or half), and I would like to thank the
following:
(i) The members of the committee,
in particular Steve Jeans and Dave
Nuttall;
(It) The thirty-odd team members,
in particular the captains and vice-
captains: Geoff Keymer, C h r i s
Calvert, Dave C r o s s l a n d , Alex
Cameron, Gareth Machin.
(Hi) Annie in the Union Office,
John Tidy and Roger Brugge for
all their help.
(iv) Stuart Cox, Simon Bennett,
Chris Tripp, John White, Ata Etemadi
and Martin Proudlove; without
them, I would have probably gone
stark raving mad.
(v) The rest of the 270 members,
for making Billiards and Snooker
the most s u c c e s s f u l and most
sociable, club in RCC, SCC, A C C
or any other C C .
