Dear Sir
Recently, students at Imperial
College have seen the formation
of the Anti-Apartheid G r o u p .
F o r m e d in response to the Boat
C l u b visit to S o u t h Africa, the
G r o u p h a v e f r e q u e n t l y e x -
pressed their collective feelings
in F E L I X , s o , a s t h e E d i t o r
hinted last week, it is n o w our
turn.
I suspect that when the issue
of S o u t h Africa is raised, many
students are inclined to dismiss
the subject as irrelevant. There
i s , o f c o u r s e , t h a t b o d y o f
s t u d e n t s w h o l o o k t o S o u t h
Africa for future employment,
but I will n o t concern myself
with them here.
In Britain today we find racial
problems occuring more a n d
m o r e f r e q u e n t l y . I n d e e d , a s
Britain moves towards a multi-
r a c i a l c o m m u n i t y w e will a l l
become more aware of ethnic
g r o u p s , a n d h o p e f u l l y , t h e
problems they face in adjusting
( a n d h e l p i n g u s adjust) t o a
new way of life.
It is surely i n this light that
any racial issue raised in o u r
College should be viewed. T h e
injustice we see in South Africa
can be found i n this countr^,
albeit greatly diminished. Part
of the problem is that many
people d o not realise just h o w
close to home the effects of
r a c i s m c a n b e f o u n d , a n d I
believe this leads to disregard,
if not ignorance, of situations
abroad.
Certainly, some people may
feel that active opposition to
racism is a leftist province a n d
hence taboo, but I suggest that
we should swallow o u r pride,
be prepared to side with those
of different (political) persuasions
a n d g e t o n w i t h t h e j o b o f
fighting injustice everywhere. I
d o n o t n e c e s s a r i l y a d v o c a t e
dropping o u r lecture notes (or
revision notes!) a n d making for
the nearest rally, but at least
think about a n d discuss such
i s s u e s a s r a c i s m , a n d t r y t o
attend U n i o n G e n e r a l Meetings
in order to hear a n d contribute
to informed debate.
It is often said at I C that the
U n i o n ' s f u n c t i o n s h o u l d n o t
include politics; that is for its
m e m b e r s t o d e c i d e , b u t I
believe o u r U n i o n should take
a n a c t i v e i n t e r e s t i n s o c i a l
affairs t h a t d i r e c t l y affect u s
a n d t h e world w e live i n .

Dear Colin
In reply to Sean O'Boyle's
letter of last week I would say
t h a t g r a s s i s d e f i n i t e l y n o t
harder than concrete a n d he's
very silly to think s o . In fact,
grass isn't so hard as concrete
— not b y a long chalk (which
also isn't a s hard as concrete
— h o , h o ) a n d p e o p l e c a n
badly cut themselves falling o n
c o n c r e t e , w h e r e a s grass h a s
soothing properties.
In fact, I'd love to see a Beit
Q u a d of open grass — a veri-
table wilderness like prairie of
t h e s t u f f w h e r e a m a n c a n
stride out a n d build a log cabin
of his o w n a n d raise a herd of
cattle a n d a family. H o w we
must b e m o a n the loss of this
last u n t a m e d p l a i n , p r o b a b l y
w i t h d i s a s t r o u s e c o l o g i c a l
consequences for species like
the Beit Q u a d Dingo a n d the
elusive Darwin's hawk which
l e d C h a r l e s D a r w i n t o h i s
theory of evolution.
S o I would urge a campaign
to p r e s e r v e t h i s l a s t b i t o f
unconcreted I C a n d defend it
from the weirdos like O'Boyle.

Dear Editor and all
Having just read this term's
Felicies, m y comments must be
thus: S o r r y A n n i e but even
sarcasm will not stop mr justice
oldground - I tried it last J u n e ,
with little apparent success. It did
not stop J a m e s J o y c e either (well
have you read Finnegans W a k e ?
O r even tried to find a copy?
Believe m e , it makes J N seem
almost intelligible, even if not
credible, in comparison).
H e is probably just having a
•precampaign warm-up before
running for F E L I X Editor, which
means that y o u m a y be able to
ignore h i m extremely easily
during 1981/2.
Apologies if anyone considers
this to be a spiteful or vindictive
letter (which I do not) but anyone
who sets him (or h e r ) self up as
some kind of public figure c a n
expect some kind of feedback,
even at I C . This is k n o w n
variously as public reaction a n d
public opinion.
Y o u r s , Philistinely,
K e n (who?) Fenning (oh him)
