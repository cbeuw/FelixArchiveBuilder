Five in the
running for
President
By Dave Edwards
Editor
The 2005 Imperial College
Union sabbatical elections
have begun in earnest, with
five candidates standing for
the post of President, the
largest number since 2000.
In all, six students will take
a year out from their stud-
ies to occupy full time roles
within the students’ union.
The President and three
Deputy Presidents lead the
Union, while the Felix Editor
is entirely responsible for
the editing and manage-
ment of this newspaper. The
President of the Imperial
College School of Medicine
Students’ Union is also a sab-
batical position, with an elec-
tion due to be held later this
term.
The candidates for
President, the most high
profile position but probably
also the most demanding,
are James Devine, Sameena
Misbahuddin, Morten Olesen,
Simon Rawson and Colin
Smith.
Mr Smith is the current
Welfare Campaigns Officer.
In his manifesto, highlighting
the Union’s “pitiful” response
to major issues such as top-
up fees and the war in Iraq,
he argues that “for all these
reasons and more, it is time
for change”.
Mr Rawson points to his
“four years’ involvement
with ICU at every level” and
says he has “strong beliefs”
of what he would deliver as
President, listing his four
main priorities as identities,
student activities, value from
services, and representation.
Mr Olesen, Vice Chair of the
Athletics Clubs Committee,
says he believes he is “the
best person for the job” and
promises in his manifesto “to
make the Union a venue that
caters for everyone regard-
less of their ethnicity, religion
or other beliefs”.
Ms Misbahuddin, the cur-
rent Deputy President (Fin-
ance and Services), points
to the need for “a President
with experience”, claiming to
be “the only candidate who’s
guaranteed to hit the ground
running and deliver results”.
Mr Devine, an “experi-
enced and active member
of the Union”, pledges to
“introduce a smoke free bar
area”, facilitate direct com-
munication between sabbati-
cals and students, and spend
more money on clubs and
societies.
Last year’s sabbatical elec-
tions were dogged by con-
troversy surrounding the
new online voting system.
At one stage, the Elections
Committee announced that
the whole election would be
re-balloted, but this decision
was reversed and the results
were eventually counted and
announced, albeit weeks
behind schedule. An issue of
this newspaper was impound-
ed because due to allegations
thatitscontentmayhavejeop-
ardised the election process,
but Felix was subsequently
completely exonerated in
a report by one of the Vice
Presidents of the University
of London Union.
Voters will have several
chances to meet the candi-
dates and ask questions at
hustings next week (see
What’s On, page 20, for more
details). Voting takes place
online between Friday 11 and
Tuesday 15 February.
