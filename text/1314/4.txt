Science may hold the solu-
tions to the world’s problems,
or it may perpetuate them. A
report published two weeks
ago has found that even if sci-
ence could help in relieving
global poverty or slowing cli-
mate change, it is much more
likely that scientific expertise
will focus on developing the
next high-technology weap-
ons.
The Soldiers in the
Laboratory report published
by Scientists for Global
Responsibility (SGR) was
launched in a meeting at the
Houses of Parliament, which
Felix attended.
The report states that the
military has too large an
influence on UK research and
development, with a third of
all public research funding
coming from the Ministry of
Defence (MoD) and 40% of
government R&D personnel
employed by the MoD.
According to the report,
this has created a defence-
centred global climate, mar-
ginalising the social causes
and consequences of conflict
and contributing to a global
arms proliferation and refu-
gee crisis.
As a solution, the report
calls for money to be redirect-
ed into peace-building and
sustainable developments.
Dr Chris Langley, the
report’s author, argued: “The
main points of this report can
be grouped into three main
headings: the disproportion-
ate and powerful influence
of the military sector on the
research agenda of areas of
science, technology and engi-
neering; the lack of funds
for other endeavours, which
address peace issues, secu-
rity issues and those related
to social responsibility; and
the third is the closing up of
accessibility for whole areas
of science, particularly the
emerging technologies, when
the military is involved.”
Speakers at the meeting
argued that the military are
seeking high-technology solu-
tions to complex problems,
when in fact technology alone
does not hold the answers to
world conflict.
The current strategy of mil-
itary spending was claimed to
be outdated and harks back
to the Cold War. As Dr Ian
Gibson, MP and Chair of the
House of Commons select
committee for science and
technology, explained at the
meeting:
“There is a long history
of battles of nation against
nation and better weapons
mean that you win the battle.
So when that is the underly-
ing political force in a nation,
and it’s gone on for centuries,
then we’re just continuing so
that all the creativity that we
have goes into making better
weapons.”
Dr Langley proposes that
high-technology, weapon-
focused solutions will not
solve the international terror-
ism issue. Diplomacy, policing
and border control may prove
to be more effective.
Dr Langley also said that
the common argument that
military spending produces
spin-offs into the public sec-
tor is fundamentally flawed.
The process of adapting a
technology from a military to
a civilian context is long and
expensive and does not yield
the benefits that some claim,
he said.
Another key point of the
report was the involvement
of universities in military
research. Through military-
academia collaborations (of
which Imperial has nine – one
of the highest in the country),
the report argues that the
next wave of researchers are
being sucked into an environ-
ment of how to win conflict
rather than how to prevent it.
But the funding incentives
these collaborations may
offer may take precedence
over the moral and ethical
issues.
Dr Langley said: “Many
universities are strapped for
cash, so they are very suscep-
tible to the campaigns waged
by the military corporation.
For a lot of people the excite-
ment of science may take
over from a concern about
where the money is coming
from.”
Dr Gibson believe students
should be proactive and ques-
tion the ethical issues sur-
rounding military-sponsored
research. “[Students] ought
to talk about this. They ought
to insist they have courses
on it.”
Dr Gibson argued that uni-
versities have portrayed sci-
ence as being neutral when,
in fact, it is deeply political.
Ellin Barklund is one
Imperial student who agrees
that students should be
proactive about ethical and
moral issues. Ms Barklund, a
third year electrical and elec-
tronic engineering student,
is a member of Scientists
for Global Responsibility
and intends to set-up the
first student SGR group at
Imperial: “Imperial could be
a flagship for this issue by
starting the first SGR stu-
dent group. As a science and
technology university, there
is definitely a place for this.
I do not want to start telling
people that they should think
about the ethical implications
of research; I simply think
that there should be informa-
tion provided about the issues
and dilemmas that students
may face when deciding upon
their careers.”
She would like to create a
version of the SGR booklet,
An Ethical Career in Science
and Technology?, that would
be tailored more to Imperial
students with sections on
particular areas of research
such as biology, physics and
chemistry.
Career fairs that deal with
ethical careers in science
have been held at Imperial
in the past; however, it was
decided that there was not
enough interest – possibly
due to the large number of
volunteer organisations fea-
tured – to organise another.
The University of London
Union had planned to hold a
fair this year, although that
too looks uncertain.
Both Cambridge and Oxford
offer alternative careers
fairs and Tim Foxon, secre-
tary of SGR, believes that
through active involvement
with groups like the Imperial
Careers office, another
Imperial ethical careers fair
may be possible.
Theissueofopennessisalso
being discussed. Barklund
thinks that students should
look at the kind of research
that is going on at Imperial.
As this is military work there
will obviously be sensitivity
issues; however, Dr Langley
argues that a lack of open-
ness stunts discussion about
military-funded research, and
that this should be more open
to public scrutiny, especial-
ly since research may have
implications for society.
Although the report’s find-
ings and proposals are ethi-
cally sound, they are noth-
ing new to people working
in research and development.
The problem is not raising
the issues; it is how to deal
with them. This prompts the
question: Will this report have
any impact?
Military-funded science is
a complex issue with many
factors involved, a major one
being the link between weap-
ons development and reve-
nue generated from UK arms
sales.
Although Dr Langley does
not believe this report will
change things overnight
(even though the report has
had quite a healthy take-up
with 2000 copies being down-
loaded so far), he hopes it
may make people at least
consider the issue:
“[This report] is asking peo-
ple to consider the amount
of money that’s going into
military research and devel-
opment and asking us to
consider if this is the most
cost effective way that we can
make the world a more just
and peaceful one. Clearly, to
defend a country we’ll need
military investment of some
sort. It’s just the amount and
pervasiveness and the lack
of any voice questioning that
investment that concerns
us.”

weapon-focused
solutions will not solve
the international
terrorism issue”

in brief
Human stem cells
become nerve
cells in study
Stem cells taken from human
embryos were coaxed into
becoming motor neurons in
an experiment that might
help scientists repair dam-
aged nervous systems. The
study supports claims by stem
cell researchers that they can
train embryonic stem cells to
develop into any type of tissue
in the body. They hope this
technology will allow cures
for a range of nervous sys-
tem injuries.
‘New Manhattan
project’ to fight
bioterror
The world needs an effort
similar to that behind the
creation of the atomic bomb
to tackle the threat of bio-
warfare, US Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist said. “We
need to do something that
even dwarfs the Manhattan
project,” Frist told the World
Economic Forum in Davos.
He predicted that the world
would experience another
bioweapon attack within the
next decade.
Scientists grapple
with climate as
crisis grows
Scientists will step into a feud
between Washington and its
allies over global warming at
a British-sponsored meeting
this week. The conference
comes just days after an inter-
national report described the
climate crisis as a time bomb.
Scientists from 30 nations will
meet in Exeter to try to define
what constitutes “dangerous”
levels of warming, but will not
make any recommendations
to policy-makers.
Meteorite hits
Cambodia
A ten pound meteorite which
landed in a former Khmer
Rouge zone of northwest
Cambodia started fires across
rice fields, while villagers,
who saw it as a divine omen
of peace, prayed. The black
lump of celestial rock sent
the villagers scurrying for
cover when it thumped into
the ground in the war-scarred
southeast-Asian nation last
week. The item itself has
been carried away by police
pending scientific analysis.

flagship for this issue
by starting the first

“...universities have for
too long portrayed the
image of science as
being neutral, when it
is in fact deeply
political”
