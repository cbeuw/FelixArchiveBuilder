To pay or not to pay
Council tax is an issue that comes
up from time to time in this line of
work. There is often some confusion
from some students around whether
they should pay it or not, which in
many cases is just down to the stu-
dents not being aware of the official
line. Hopefully the rest of this article
will help to set the record straight.
Students are not automatically
exempt from council tax, though in
certain circumstances the property
may be. Your liability for council tax
depends on whether you are deemed
to be a full-time student, where you
live and with whom you live.
The definition of a student for
exemption purposes is: “You are
studying full time at a UK institu-
tion if you are enrolled on a course
for the ‘relevant period’ which lasts
for at least one academic year; you
are attending at least 24 weeks per
year; the course requires at least 21
hours of term time study per week;
and you are studying at a prescribed
educational establishment.”
The ‘relevant period’ starts on the
day you begin your course and ends
on the day you officially finish, and
includes holidays which fall in that
time. If you permanently leave your
course, the relevant period will be
until the last day you study.
University halls of residence
Halls of residence are automatically
exempt from council tax and there-
fore you will not receive a bill. ‘Halls
of residence’ is taken to mean any
accommodation that is ‘owned or
managed by an educational estab-
lishment’ and predominantly for the
accommodation of students. If you
have any difficulty with this, please
contact the Information and Advice
Centre.
House occupied solely by
students
Where all the residents of a house
are full time students (according
to definition), the property is clas-
sified exempt from council tax. In
this situation, all residents in the
house will need to get a council
tax exemption certificate from the
College Registry.
Houses in multiple
occupation
These are houses where each room
is let out separately under different
letting agreements (for example, a
house converted into bedsits where
some facilities are shared).
The landlord is liable to pay the
council tax on the whole property
and cannot pass the bill directly to
the tenants. The landlord can, how-
ever, include this cost as a propor-
tion of the rent.
You will need to look at your
tenancy agreement to see how
the landlord has distributed liabil-
ity and if necessary seek advice on
your tenancy agreement from the
Information and Advice Centre.
Resident landlords
Where you lodge with your landlord,
it is (s)he who is liable to pay council
tax. Your landlord cannot ask you to
pay any of the bill directly, but (s)he
may have included some of the cost
in your rent.
Houses with student and non-
student residents (aged 18+)
In cases where there is only one
resident who is not a full time stu-
dent, a 25% single person discount
applies. Where there is more than
one non-student resident, the prop-
erty becomes liable for the full coun-
cil tax bill. Once this is ascertained,
it is then up to the house as a whole
how they want to pay the bill.
If the bill is not paid, the coun-
cil can pursue any resident in the
house for the full bill. This includes
any one of the student residents.
Where one of the residents is
receiving state benefits, (s)he may
be able to claim council tax benefit.
Exemption certificates
It is important to remember that in
order to get any exemption the local
authority will require evidence that
you are a student. Exemption cer-
tificates are available from Imperial
College Registry.

Paint the College green
By Rebecca Slack
Universities are being ‘urged to
go green’ by the Higher Education
Funding Council for England
(HEFCE), and about time too.
However, for universities offering
courses in environmental studies,
the urge to be green should come
from within and not have to be foist-
ed upon them from outside.
According to a report in The
Guardian (11 January 2005), there
are a number of universities already
taking steps to reduce their impact
on the environment, but Imperial
does not seem to make this list.
Does this mean that the College
is not making any attempt to pro-
mote environmental and sustainable
development?
There have been some small
attempts at Imperial towards this
end. From a South Kensington cam-
pus point of view, these are most
visible through the construction and
operation of photovoltaic cells on
Imperial College Road, which look
good as well as serving a very useful
purpose, and the eclectic waste recy-
cling schemes offered by the many
different departments.
One waste collection and recy-
cling scheme, being operated in
the Department of Environmental
Sciences, could be expanded to the
wider college. The response from
both students and staff in the DES
scheme, which is itself run by a
committee of students and staff, has
been amazing and has resulted in
the collection of a wide range of
recyclables.
A separate battery collection
scheme, implemented by the Estates
Department, has already led to the
collection of hundreds of batteries
which will be sent for reprocessing.
Over 30,000 tonnes of batteries are
used in the UK every year but only
200 tonnes are collected – the rest
are disposed of at landfill sites. And
these are products considered to
have hazardous contents! Through
separate collection, batteries are
therefore diverted from landfill, con-
tributing to a reduction in the risks
posed by such disposal.
So there have been some attempts
toturnthecollege‘green’,butdespite
the success of these schemes, they
are small scale. More needs to be
done by all. For Imperial to develop
a reputation as a university with a
commitment to sustainability, vari-
ous measures need to be adopted
and adhered to, from an ethical/
environmental purchasing policy to
waste minimisation strategies and
renewable energy purchasing.
The day may come when a uni-
versity’s environmental and ethi-
cal impact becomes one of the fac-
tors that determines its position in
the higher education league tables
and affects funding opportunities.
However, if these green measures
are to work, students and staff must
be willing to actively participate.
After all, Imperial does have a big
impact upon the environment and
society as a whole, particularly as
students move on to future roles
as managers and leaders (to quote
from HEFCE’s strategy!)
Start a (green) revolution at
Imperial – put pressure on the pow-
ersthatbetochangeImperialCollege
into the most sustainable university
in England, nay, the world.
As you may have heard recently,
the College’s plans to redevelop
Southside have been granted con-
sent by Westminster Council,
subject to several pages worth of
‘conditions’. These are not overly
onerous but basically require the
College to pay greater attention to
things like the landscaping of the
gardens. This will, of course, be for
the benefit of the wealthy residents
of Knightsbridge, to be funded from
the rents of hard-pressed future stu-
dents...
In addition, the College has to
further develop its ‘student manage-
ment plan’ ie show it has the balls to
discipline students who misbehave.
With a bit of luck, this means that
demolition work should now start,
on time, the week after students
move out at the end of the summer
term.
Inevitably, people will ask about
where all the student facilities cur-
rently in the Southside building will
move to, and this is want I want to
(sort of) focus on.
The fitness gym and the sports
hall are due to be replaced by the
new sports centre. However, that
will not be ready until late
November, leaving a gap over the
summer vacation and at the start
of next academic year. The Union
is still involved in discussions with
the College as to where the stu-
dent clubs’ activities will move to
both in the short and long term.
Whilst we would like to try to move
as much as possible into the new
sports centre, competing priorities
mean the College may require us
to move some to the St Mary’s
campus. Similarly, there is an
outstanding disagreement as to
whether the Union free weights gym
needs to be replicated.
The future of the bar/catering pro-
vision at Southside is, inevitably, up
for discussion, though with less stu-
dents living in Princes Gardens (and
with both Linstead and Weeks hav-
ing their own bars) there is less of a
need for them in the short term.
The College Counsellors will move
to Sherfield, to be closer to the other
student-facing services there.
Medical madness
That leaves the NHS facilities
(Health Centre and Dentists’
Practice), which will move out of
Southside into a temporary medi-
cal centre next term. This will be
located on the tennis courts next to
Linstead Hall. (Yes, we shall be los-
ing our tennis courts.)
Which brings me on to what I
really want to talk about: campus
medical facilities. As President I am
a member of the College’s Medicial
And Dental Services Advisory
Committee (MADSAC) which over-
sees the College’s contract with its
NHS service providers. I’ve actu-
ally never attended a meeting. I’ve
always sent my Deputy President
(Education and Welfare) along
instead since, until a few weeks
ago, I wasn’t even registered at the
Health Centre and had never used
the Dentist.
With the long-term future of
the medical services now under
consideration I’d just like to invite
comment from readers as to
what they think of the services.
Clearly the Health Centre and
Dentist are necessary, but do they
deliver what you expect? Please do
write in to Felix so we can begin the
discussion!
How will Southside affect your health?
