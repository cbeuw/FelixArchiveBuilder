Columns felix@ic.ac.uk
In response to suggestions from readers and contributors, a couple of light-hearted, ‘fun’ columns make their debuts this week. Let us know what you think at felix@ic.ac.uk
What’s uni supposed to be about?
It’s about exams, studying and
learning become a useful member
of the workforce, right? My bottom.
It’s about having fun for the last
time in your life.
Remember, once you get a job, you
won’t be free until you’re old. Very
old in most cases. You should treas-
ure the time you’ve spent loafing at
home/watching movies/eating rub-
bish. Uni is the place to have ‘Good
Times’ to treasure when you’re
older. When else is it acceptable to
be eating a kebab at 3am having
just finished a marathon of three
series of 24?
The difference between a stu-
dent and a member of the work-
force SHOULD be distinct. If you
have a job as a student, that’s fine,
but its not what defines you. It’s a
part-time effort to scrape together
some money. Your life as a student
does define you, and quite possi-
bly the rest of your life. You learn
to operate free of safety nets. Or
at least you should do. You make
mistakes, and you learn from them.
These mistakes should include, ide-
ally, social life mistakes. You don’t
have to drink, but if you do, you
learn not to spend all your loan
in the first week on booze before
resorting to whoring out your sorry
ass to many jobs, whilst missing lec-
tures. Or at least hopefully you do.
But the fun is in the trying.
The point of university is that it
teaches you to live. It teaches you
how to organise your time so that
you can work and play. There’s no
point in just working, because then
you miss out on the bigger pic-
ture. That’s why clubs and societies
are put forward as being important
– no-one wants automatons who
do nothing but work. Even in job
interviews, extra-curricular activi-
ties are major things – flexibility
and juggling are crucial to employ-
ers. And frankly, if you have only
one string to your bow, how much
can you possibly add to the job? You
need to be able to think outside the
box quite frequently nowadays (if
only to get through stupid question-
naires for application forms), and
that requires a life full of diverse
experience.
So, the moral? Get out, do stuff,
put something back into the univer-
sity and its social life. Remember,
for every effort you put in, you get
eight times that amount back. That’s
guaranteed*, and also remember
you get paid for most fun stuff*.
But seriously, just get out there and
do stuff. Be more than a candidate
number.

Taking back the streets
by TRISTAN LANE
With the girl about town’s monthly
bible (aka Glamour magazine) quot-
ing that there are 50,000 more sin-
gle women aged 20-34 than men in
London, at least the pulling ratios
at Imperial College should still
be working in an attractive medic
lady’s favour. Such a girl should be
spoken for, having taken the pick
of the men, considering the lack of
competition, and quality competi-
tion at that.
Alas, it turns out that fate and logic
are both cruel, and my extremely
attractive friends and I have real-
ised we are the single survivors of
the fourth year.
I’m sure you’d sympathise that
moving back to London after a
hectic Christmas on reception in
an incestuous country hospital
can only be a good thing. Youthful,
overweight rural fogeys, and their
older, blithering Barbour-wearing
counterparts don’t count among my
wide and wonderful array of fetishes
– and a Saturday hunt is not my idea
of a date!
I had barely unpacked my bags,
when flatmate one (I have two,
one of whom is sensibly taken by
a worthy guy and doesn’t partake
in the hormonally crazed madness)
spotted victim number one for me:
hot Australian dreadlock boy, best
known as the tradesman from the
flat upstairs. I have a well-publi-
cised weakness for the laid back
surfer look, which stopped me from
wasting this golden opportunity
for the perfect fling of convenience
(he lives upstairs for goodness
sakes!)
I spoke to the previous occupant
– a good friend of mine, also out on
the pull – and she mentioned he
was an Aussie called Dan who lived
on the top floor, in flat 21... and that
I wouldn’t find him especially fit.
I chose to go for the conventional
approach: waiting to cross paths
unexpectedly in a sedate but friend-
ly manner.
Unfortunately, flatmate number
one had other ideas. She kept bump-
ing into Dan repeatedly within the
hallwaysthroughouttheweek.Seven
days passed, and I’d seen absolutely
everyone in the building, their chil-
dren and au pairs (still no fitness,
with the inhabitants mostly female
and prissy) but no Dan! Drunkenly
giggly, desperately horny and tarted
up after a raucous bitching session
that evening, I found my way to the
top floor and knocked on one of the
doors, ready to introduce myself
with the ultimate punchline: “Hey,
I’ve just moved into the building and
thought I’d pop by and say ‘hi’. I’m
also mates with Helen who used to
live here too, and she told me Dan
was worth introducing myself to. Is
he in?”
Unprepared for the inevitable
“who’s Dan?” I ended up describ-
ing him using the precious little
I knew, which was blurted out as
“sexy dreadlock guy”.
I was helpfully directed to Dan’s
flat, and so, on my third deep breath,
amidst a lot of giggling, I introduced
myself to a portly, defensive, slightly
bovine female with Jerry Springer
BBQ Supernoodle hair. I had dif-
ficulty keeping a straight face, bear-
ing in mind this introduction was
followed by the Spanish inquisition
into how I knew Dan, where I knew
him from and what I wanted to
do with him! Incidentally, he wasn’t
home that night.
I broke into more giggles and
ended up mentioning Helen, my
extremely fit friend who’d just left
the flat. This left the sex-starved
munter further perplexed, and I
beat a hasty, drunken, not-so gra-
cious retreat, collapsing in laughter
as I slid down the carpet of four
sets of stairs. Bumpy rides are fun,
aren’t they?
This particular bumpy ride contin-
ued when Dan continued to bump
into flatmate number one, and stare
longingly into her eyes, three times
a day for the next week. Matters
weren’t helped when his flatmate
told him a giggly little Asian girl was
on the lookout for him, and that all
our flatmates fitted that description.
Flatmate one’s descriptions of Dan
got progressively less appealing on
a daily basis, and by the time day ten
rolled round after another drunken
bitching session, curiosity killed the
cat – he couldn’t be ugly and intrigu-
ing, could he?
A new friend had arrived to join us
for the evening, and so, dressed in
her winter coat with umbrella and
wrongly written address in tow, we
sent her upstairs to ask for direc-
tions to number 23 (we have 22 flats
in our building). She was instructed
(amidst peals of laughter) to miss-
call us if Dan answered, and on
doing so, we’d ring her and tell her
we were coming to pick her up,
whilst legging it up the stairs dou-
ble-time! Since she struck it lucky
there, and Dan himself answered
the door, weeks of anticipation came
to a head. But within this mighty
rush, I’d forgotten to do up my trou-
sers and fallen over my very own
doorstep.
Dan ended up showing my friend
the way to ours, leading to the
biggest disappointment and most
uncontainable giggling session of
my entire life! How could a non-
homeless Australian surfer guy not
be fit? How could a dead ringer for
Daniel ‘porky’ God-fearing ballad-
singer Bedingfield have dreadlocks?
I didn’t want to wait for the answers
this time around!
I beat a hasty retreat, and Dan
thankfully hasn’t seen me since.
Computer room guy, victim number
two, is a different story – he’s
been the new object of lust (I don’t
chase, I replace). I think I’ll let
him have his five minutes of fame
next week.
The girl about town
by STORMY WOODS
What’s this all about then?
It’s a charity ball organised by
medics and engineers. It’s to raise
money for the tsunami relief opera-
tion. It only costs a tenner, and every
penny of that goes to charity.
Every penny?
That’s right. They can afford to send
every penny because they’ve got two
big production companies behind
them doing all the expensive stuff.
And the acts are playing for free.
They can’t be very good then.
Nonsense. They’ve got a crack-
ing line-up. There’ll be live bands
including the world famous Imperial
College Big Band, funk and soul
from Our Souls, rock from Cartel,
and more to be confirmed over the
next few weeks. Then there are the
DJ’s. Top London superclub resident
MacPherson is already confirmed,
as is Mark Rivkin, and there’ll be a
huge number of other upbeat, chill-
out and cheese DJs on the bill as
well. Not to mention magic from the
award-winning Adam Keisner.
Well that’s all very
impressive, but why are
we still raising money for the
tsunami appeal?
Imperial students have already
raised a shedload, but this will raise
tens of thousands of pounds. And
it’s going on redevelopment, now
that the immediate relief operation
is over. It’ll all be donated to Oxfam
and Action Aid, who work with local
people to get communities back on
their feet.
I assume it’ll all take place in
some broom cupboard in the
Union as it’s run by students
and only costs a tenner...
Nope. It’s in Sherfield, 7 ‘til late.
What does ‘late’ mean?
It means it’ll be so good you won’t
want to leave. And no-one will throw
you out ‘til 2am.
Ok, I’m excited. Are you on
commission?
No – every penny to charity, remem-
ber.
So where do I get my ticket?
They’re already on sale at the
Union Reception, Southside and the
Reynolds bar. Only £10, remember.
Got it.
And look at the website at www.
entertain-event.co.uk to keep up
with progress. See you there?
Heck yeah. It’s making me
moist just thinking about it.
Really?
Yep.
