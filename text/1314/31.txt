Imperial Men’s 4th 4
UCL Men’s 4th 2
By Michael Nicholson
After a long winter break and
two abysmal friendly per-
formances against our own
fifths, Imperial Fourths finally
returnedtocompetitiveaction
against their namesakes from
UCL.
The starting eleven had a
very settled look to it with
Tim and Shinguards at cen-
tre-half, alongside regular
full-backs Toony and Ed Goh.
Aldridge-Carlos took his
Bambi-style running into mid-
field in place of Paul, who was
injured again. Alongside the
Bambi-man in the middle was
Dave the Hippy, with tricky
wingers Parrot and Demetris
starting in their usual roles.
Fresh from his brush with
a certain tsunami, Shwin
started up front with Jai.
The slick passing, which
had so deserted the fourths
during the matches against
the fifths, made an instant
and welcome return, and
Imperial managed to create
a multitude of chances in the
first few minutes with Jai
and Shwin both having half-
chances.
The breakthrough came
only thanks to a momentous
howler from the UCL keeper.
A nice move involving most of
the team managed to work the
ball to the Parrot on the left,
who jinked and twisted past
a couple of players in trade-
mark style before unleashing
what can only be described as
a daisy cutting trundler.
The keeper thought the best
way to deal with such an effort
was to leap in the air and
pounce on it like some sort
of strange cat. Hilariously, he
missed, and the ball trickled
through his arms and legs to
gift Imperial a soft lead.
Chances upon chances
were subsequently created
by the impressive midfield,
and both Jai and Shwin really
should have done better when
neat passing moves pre-
sented them both with gilt-
edged chances. Sadly, Shwin
spooned a free header into
orbit, and Jai somehow man-
aged to screw the ball wide
when my Grandma could
have scored. Thankfully, both
lads kept their heads up, and
when Shwin was presented
with another simple chance
– thanks to some woeful UCL
marking at a free-kick – he
gratefully knocked it in to give
Imperial a deserved two goal
lead at half-time.
The second half was much
of the same with shots from
Imperial raining down onto
the UCL keeper. It was no
surprise that IC went three
up when Jai flew through the
air like a swooping eagle (not
of the Figo variety) to power
home a Parrot cross from the
left.
Sadly, fatigue set in at
around the seventy minute
mark, and UCL, to their
credit, began to dominate
the game. With Bambi strug-
gling with a bash on the nose,
their very fast, very small,
very annoying winger man-
aged to escape from three
poor tackles in the centre cir-
cle, freeing up some room for
the strikers. The pair of them
combined nicely and a neat
finish gave UCL a way back
into the match.
UCL continued to domi-
nate through IC’s tiredness,
but against the run of play
Imperial restored the three
goal advantage when the
Parrot bent a free-kick in off
the upright, despite the best
efforts of Jai on the line try-
ing to hi-jack the goal. The
scoring was still not finished
though, and another lapse
in concentration at the back
allowed UCL to claw back
another.
Four-two was how the
match ended, with the fourths
earning a morale-boosting
victory. Among the positives
for the side were Bambi’s
excellent battling display in
midfield and a far greater
assuredness on the ball; how-
ever, there are still plenty of
improvements that must be
made if we are to win the Cup
this year.
FOOTBALL
Fourths make winning start to 2005
Imperial Men’s 4th 2
St George’s Men’s 4th 2
Despite TKT's best efforts,
we eventually made it back
to the Croydon Badlands.
Stepping over the headless
body in the sports centre car
park, it was hard to ignore
the smell of death in the air,
which was only overpowered
by the stench of the goalkeep-
er's kit.
Our efforts to confuse the
opposition by turning up 30
minutes late seemed to suc-
ceed as we took the game
by the scruff of the neck and
rammed it thoroughly into
their half.
St Georges had started
slowly, and Second Avenue
capitalised, latching onto the
rebound of Tightlips' power-
ful shot and turning it past
their wretched 'keeper.
The DeIViants dominated
play for the entire first half.
Opposition attacks were bro-
ken down almost as soon
as they were started. With
Tightlips controlling the
game from midfield, Bleeding
Dick and Glasto prevented
any chance of the oppostion
entering our half, and, with
the creativity and hard work
of Spanish Shinquisition,
Creamy Mouthful and
Colgate, it looked as though
St Georges were almost dead
and buried, especially when
TKT slammed in a shot from
the top of the D to make it 2-0.
The first half came to a close
with practically everyone in
the St Georges half.
At half time the opposition
used a diversionary tactic
by setting the trees behind
their goal on fire. It was
rumoured that they had
strapped their sub to a tree
and sacrificed him in order
to turn the game around.
Unfortunately, their sacrifice
seemed to do the trick. As
Dirty Sheets eyed up the fire-
men at the beginning of the
second half, his ‘clean sheet’
was soiled when St Georges
pulled one back. Although
stunned by conceding this
early second half goal, the
DeIViants soon steadied the
ship thanks to the hard work
and perseverance of Slow
On The Uptake and some
Randoms.
The search for the third
goal, which would kill the
game (and be the fifth kill-
ing in Croydon that day), had
started. TKT created several
chances but failed to take
any of them whilst Post and
Tightlips also had oppor-
tunties.
As the game entered into
its final stages, there was
an awful feeling in the air
and it wasn't because news
had filtered through that
an undertaker had been
runover by his own hearse
at a nearby location. Many
chances had been wasted and
it would take just one lucky
counter-attack from the oppo-
sition to be able to score and
level the game. What fol-
lowed was completely and
utterly devastating for the
DeIViants.
It was at the death (con-
tinuing the theme of the day)
that the oppostion had a
lucky counter-attack and
were able to score and level
the game.
On the way home, the
depressed DeIViants sud-
denly realised that things
weren't so bad. It was the
first point of the season, and
the first time we had scored,
and we hadn't conceded any
short corners. It was a fine
performance from the whole
team.
Fear not, for the DeIViants
are on their way back!

First points of season for DeIViants

Imperial 1st 23
Goldsmiths 1st 22
By Erika Kennington
A double header on Monday
saw the firsts add another two
wins to the season, in their
tightest game to date.
Following numerous post-
ponements by Goldsmiths, it
was decided that this match
would count for both the
BUSA league and ULU cup
matches, setting up a game
with 6 points at stake.
Having never played
Goldsmiths before, we had no
idea what we would be up
against, and this was our first
match since the Christmas
break so everyone was feeling
a bit rusty. Spirits were high,
though, as it gave us chance to
unveil the new kit, although it
did lead us to question its suit-
ability on cold Monday nights
in the middle of winter!
So to the match. Imperial
set off quietly in the first quar-
ter, with both teams evenly
matched, gauging the tactics
of the opposition. Freezing
conditions meant that the
pitch was icing over as we
played, severely slowing down
our game, and we took only
a two-goal lead into the first
break.
We picked up the pace in
the second and third quarters,
albeit in an attempt to avoid
hypothermia, but despite
some great play working the
ball up the court, we couldn’t
establish a decisive lead.
Goldsmiths were clearly not
going to give up the points
without a fight, and our eight
week break since our last
match meant we were not
quite on top form. A few dodgy
set-plays cost us some of our
lead in the final quarter, but
we held our nerve and one-
goal lead to the final whistle.
At the end of the day, though,
a win is still a win (or two in
this case), and has taken us
to the quarter finals of the
ULU Cup and third place in
our BUSA league. Well done
guys!

Twice in one night
Wye Women’s 1st 20
GKT Women’s 1st 15
By Lucy Le Cocq
Road rage caused pre-match
drama when the Wye girls
ventured out of the country-
side to remind GKT that they
can’t beat us. Ever. Domestic
violence between our army of
male westcountry supporters
on the A205 was too much
for our violent number eight
who felt the need to abuse
them, risking her life in the
smog and London traffic in
the process.
Once we had composed
ourselves enough to look for
the pitch, we were utterly
shocked to find it located in
a rather urban area; however
the relief of seeing grass for
the first time in an hour was
immense.
The forwards worked hard
and we were rewarded with
our first try from a lineout set
piece. Gobby missed the con-
version as the ball appeared
to be too heavy to leave the
ground. The embarrassment
was too much and a small
scratch on her knee caused
potential hospitalisation.
However, some good run-
ning and talking earlier in the
game more than made up for
this. After a quick reorganisa-
tion, Annie was drafted in to
play fly half, where she did a
great job.
Radio Full Back thought
that we would crumble, how-
ever we didn’t. She wasn’t on
the right wavelength. Great
running from the elusive Em
put us on the scoreboard,
however GKT equalised. The
Wye midgets couldn’t hold
the weight of the GKT maul,
anchored by their apparently
unfriendly giant number
eight. This result resulted in
the crumbling of the maul.
The match showed great
form from our captain Scum,
who combined awesome tack-
ling with quick offloading from
the scrum. Her leadership
kept our heads up throughout
the game.
In the second half Hetty’s
awesome power gave us
another five points and
Emily’s massive speed
blasted through the opposi-
tion. Suzie’s personal experi-
ence with number 7 put her
off hurting anyone to that
extent ever again.
Great hooking by Cat was
only one feature of our great
scrum which turned the ball
over on several occasions.
Becky showed great potential
with her running and tackling.
Recognising the good bits and
working hard together will be
necessary in preparation for
the next game.
This was not our tidiest
game, but commitment from
the whole team contributed
to our victory. The hospitality
from GKT was the best this
season and we’d like to thank
them for a well-matched
game. The final scoreline was
a true reflection of a match
that could have gone either
way and was undecided until
the final whistle.
