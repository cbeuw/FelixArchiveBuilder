JAMES DEVINE
PRESIDENT
● The President is the figurehead of Imperial College Union, with ultimate responsibility for all its activities
● There are 5 candidates, plus the option to Re-Open Nominations (see page 13)
The Union is an organisation which
exists to provide for you as a student
and to speak up for you in College.
Union clubs and societies are
an integral part of student life at
Imperial. I am an experienced and
active member of the Union. I’ve
been a club chair and a club treas-
urer. I edited Guildsheet, the engi-
neering students’ newspaper, and
I’ve written for Felix and Live!
College must put students first. It’s
the little things, like having a lunch
hour, being consulted about changes
to our university, or at least being
given adequate notice. I’m commit-
ted to supporting faculty unions to
build better student representation
across college so that all students,
including MSc and Post grads, get a
say in how things are done.
The Union needs a new website,
an intranet and a new finance sys-
tem, I’ll make sure we get these
within a year. We can do more to
save the environment and save
money at the same time, by doing
things like running the union mini-
bus fleet on bio-diesel. I support the
idea of a Fairtrade university.
I’ll make the time to listen and
answer emails personally.
My pledges…
1) A smoke free bar area in the
Union.
2) Direct communication between
sabbaticals and students.
3) Less money on full time union
staff, more money for clubs and soci-
eties
Sure we’d all like more coffee bars
and better catering, but anywhere
can serve a double mocha-choca-
latte. The Union is the only place
providing your representation.
SAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN
It’s at the start of term that so many
of the Union’s important services are
delivered, so we need a President
with experience and the ability to
make changes immediately.
As current Deputy President
(Finance and Services) I’ve achieved
results already, taking leading roles
in the Strategic Review – the Union’s
biggest ever student feedback
exercise – restructuring the club
budgeting system, and the Union
refurbishment project. I’ve fulfilled
manifesto promises including rein-
stating nightbuses, improving feed-
back and working towards a Union
Coffee Bar.
Having helped get these started,
I’m most qualified to see them
through; a newcomer would take
time to learn the ropes and gain my
knowledge and experience.
The Student Activity Centre needs
overhauling so we must implement
this over the summer, starting by
eliminating the excessive paper-
work involved in running clubs/soci-
eties and replacing them with sim-
pler online systems.
Improving communication
between the Union and students
needs to be a priority, with every
student knowing what we do, how
to get involved and who’s there to
help. We can achieve this via Felix
articles, a more comprehensive and
user-friendly Union Website, adopt-
ing a more approachable style and
having a campus-wide presence.
I’m committed to extending
library hours year-round, improv-
ing integration for outlying cam-
puses, and better representation
for Postgraduate and International
Students
Everyone benefits from a better
union – with a President committed
to the needs of all students. With my
experience and track record, I’m the
only candidate who’s guaranteed to
hit the ground running and deliver
results.
MORTEN OLESEN
I’m running for President because
I believe I’m the best person for the
job. I will not make loads of prom-
ises I won’t be able to keep, but I do
promise that I will listen carefully
to the students, represent them to
the best of my ability and broker
the best deal possible. Also, I prom-
ise to provide better resources and
administrative support for clubs and
societies. Lastly, I promise to make
the Union a venue that caters for
everyone regardless of their ethnic-
ity, religion or other beliefs.
My main aim as President will be
to gain the trust of the students; I
believe I can do this. I have leader-
ship experiences both from various
clubs as well as the Union, where
I worked for almost three years. I
sit on Union Council as well as the
Executive Committee and I’m the
ACC Vice Chair this year. I hope
these experiences have put my fin-
ger on the pulse of students’ opinion
of how the Union should be run.
We must elect a candidate repre-
senting the broadest student opin-
ion. Whether you believe I’m the
best candidate or not, the important
thing is for the majority of the stu-
dents to elect who they believe to be
the best person to represent them. I
therefore strongly urge all students
to vote so we can truly claim to
have a Union run by students for
students.
SIMON RAWSON
After four year’s involvement with
ICU, at every level, I have strong
beliefs of what I would deliver as
President:
Identities
Studying in a vast, anonymous city,
at a large intensive university, eve-
ryone needs something to identify
with. Making this possible is one of
ICU’s most important roles. I recog-
nise the importance of all the con-
stituent groups which make up ICU,
everywhere. Crucially, ICU must
be in the background supporting
these groups, not placing hurdles in
their path or trying to force them to
agglomerate under one ‘brand’.
Student Activities
Although student activities at ICU
are already amongst the best in the
country, I will work to strengthen this
situation, ensuring that resources,
both financial and practical, are in
place to support activities. I support
the current moves to modernise
Beit Quad, but will ensure that stu-
dent activities are not jeopardised
in any way – in terms of finance or
facilities.
Value from Services
In South Kensington, some of the
Union services (e.g. Catering, Shop)
are underused. I believe that we
should seek to more fiercely chal-
lenge our commercial competitors
(e.g. WHSmith) in terms of both
offering and value for money. I’m
committed to this at all of our cam-
puses, so that services really do
what you want.
Representation
Arguably the most important
role of the Students’ Union is
Representation. I see the role of the
President as your ultimate repre-
sentative, responsible for actually
making your voice heard to College
and, if need be, on wider issues
which affect you too.
COLIN SMITH
It’s time for radical change in the
way our students’ union is run.
The illegal war and continued
occupation of Iraq have left over
100,000 dead, whilst our so-called
representatives sat back and did
nothing. Top-up fees were forced
through against the biggest ever
rebellion in the Labour party, with
the full support of our rector, and
again our union’s response was piti-
ful. Time and again the threat and
implementation of increased hall
rents is allowed to pass almost with-
out challenge from our sabbaticals.
Our equal opportunities policies are,
at best, weak. For all these reasons
and more, it is time for change.
Over the last few years I have
become increasingly involved, and
frustrated, with the union bureauc-
racy, first getting involved with stu-
dent council and now as the union’s
Welfare Campaigns Officer. This has
made me even more determined
to help take our union out of the
hands of the hacks, and turn it into a
fighting, democratic, representative
organisation.
I have also been heavily involved
with the mobilisations against
top-up fees, George Bush’s visit
to London last November, and the
ongoing conflict in Iraq. Recently,
I have been proud to be part of the
coalition in college fighting for jus-
tice for Babar Ahmad. The union’s
somewhat reluctant support for this
campaign is an important, but small
step forward. Elect me as President,
and we can make giant leaps.
It’s time for change.
FOR AN ANTI-WAR, ANTI-
FEES, FIGHTING STUDENTS’
UNION… VOTE COLIN SMITH for
PRESIDENT.
