RE–OPEN NOMINATIONS
By Sanjeev Sarda
RON Campaign Manager
For too long now we have let mediocre sabbaticals run our union. It is time for the voters to
step forwards and show that we will no longer accept this. By voting RON you will be sending a
message that as voters we are no longer content to accept vague promises of more money for
clubs and societies, reduced paper work and coffee bars. Every candidate may promise to listen,
but none of them seem to be able to act. We don’t need revolution, we don’t need to go out and
protest – we need to go out between the 11th and 15th and vote RON. Vote Ron – it’s easy.
