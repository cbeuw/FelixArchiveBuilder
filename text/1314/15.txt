Interested in development work?
Alex McCredie explains how you can help developing communities across the world

Why would anyone want to
go to the back of beyond, to
a disease-ridden, high crime,
corrupt country to work?
We are all well aware of
the awful tsunami aftermath,
and many of us may wonder
whether we could possibly
help out some way. You may
think it is beyond your abil-
ity to help in any way except
financially, but you might be
wrong there. I don’t know
much about the specific situ-
ation, or what it is like out
there; I only observed the
drastic news from the com-
fort of the lovely new sofa in
my father’s sitting room on
Boxing Day. But it did get me
thinking about relief and aid
in general, and I do have a
few things to say about engi-
neers’ role in such disasters
and also development work. I
am also going to tell you about
Engineers Without Borders
UK, a student organisation,
of which there is a branch at
Imperial.
Disaster relief is very differ-
ent to continual development
aid. There are special contin-
gency funds for disaster relief.
They need the money desper-
ately before whole sections of
countries suffer. RedR stands
for Registered Engineers for
Disaster Relief-they are a
charity which provides engi-
neers to aid agencies in the
event of a disaster and they
have of course been very busy
recently. Good engineers are
also essential to the develop-
ment of a country. Continual
development aid is different
and given for a variety of dif-
ferent reasons.
There is so much contro-
versy around delivering aid.
What is our responsibility
as rich educated engineers
to the developing world?
Should they be encouraged
to develop with some help, or
should we be freely handing
out donations because they
are poor and cannot manage?
Should we just give money,
or provide human resources
to sort out their problems
as well?
Peoplesometimesassociate
aid with colonialism and the
power of the rich donor coun-
tries over the poverty ridden
ones, including third world
debt, sweatshops and the
industrialisation that brought
the need for development. Is
it our governments’ fault? Is
it pure human brotherly love
that wills us to help out these
countries, or is there an ele-
ment of guilt and responsibil-
ity involved?
There is, of course, the
abundant humane will to help
the poor and starving, and we
recognise our social responsi-
bility, but not enough. I think
quite a lot of people are very
concerned about the third
world when they are young,
but when they grow up and
run their own businesses and
governments, self preserva-
tion and profits surpass car-
ing for poor countries.
However, we are living in
a wealthy aid-giving country,
and therefore we can afford
to give aid without denting
ourselves at all. Hence the
real reason we give aid is
probably shielded. The rea-
son we give aid is presented
as goodwill and pure generos-
ity. But, logically and econom-
ically, self preservation of our
country is more important.
Do we (as a country) give aid
because we have some kind
of interest in these countries,
or some guilt from the past?
Why don’t we completely
wipe out their debt? Giving
aid may make a particular
political party appear gener-
ous and caring, but their real
ambition, as it should be, is to
make Britain a better place,
not Tanzania.
I am being quite cynical.
I just think that more aid
should be given and it easily
could be. Many governments
signed up to the millennium
development goals. These are
an ambitious set of environ-
mental, health and education
targets that include halving
the proportion of people with-
out access to safe drinking
water by 2015. It is already
2005 and we are nowhere
near these targets.
Of course, there are many
people who care and under-
stand the responsibility
we have for the developing
world. Some people act on
this responsibility and want
to take charge of how aid
is delivered. They are using
their skills to design refugee
tents, predict earthquakes,
make available their struc-
tural engineering skills to
build houses, find water in
the desert, design emergency
timber bridges, teach, pro-
vide medical care, design
websites for charities, etc.
They are not blighted by
the bad pay or poor working
conditions; they even find it
exciting. Of course, no-one is
going to change the world, or
even aim to. They just want to
do their bit and make a small
difference.
Delivering aid is also a very
difficult task. Making sure it
ends up in the right place
for a start is difficult enough,
but whether it is successful
is another issue. We can see
that the relief aid efforts in
Indonesia are proving to be a
huge logistical problem.
Mistakes have been made in
the past concerning the deliv-
ery of aid. In India, for exam-
ple, charity fitted toilets and
running water were installed
in some slum houses, but
as soon as it was done, the
occupants sold their houses
and went back to living in
the slums. The general policy
now is that one does not just
give out aid; the recipients
are made to work for it, or
pay for some of it. This instils
ownership, pride and respon-
sibility over the donation. It
is imperative that these suf-
fering people also know that
we rich, educated western-
ers care. This was demon-
strated to me last summer
when I went with an Imperial
College group to El Salvador
to help construct houses in
an earthquake-damaged vil-
lage. It wasn’t the physical
work we were doing that was
important to them, it was our
mere presence and muck-
ing in, which showed that we
care and meant so much to
them. It spurred them on to
build their own houses.
It must be known that these
places exist and that we do
have a responsibility to these
poor people. It can be argued
that their government should
be responsible, but in many of
these places, getting money
for a water supply for their
village from their govern-
ment is like getting blood out
of a stone.
“The answer is not more
charity or NGO projects.
Water and sanitation is not a
matter for charity. They are
essential for human health
and development.” (Clare
Short, 2003).
Well-intentioned projects
funded by short-term aid
recipes often fail. Ms Short
was right in saying that it is a
matter for major investment
by publicly owned companies,
but it doesn’t always work
out that way either. She was
more realistic when she said
we need to concentrate on
sharing expertise and using
aid to speed up investment
in sustainable systems that
allow reasonable charges and
ensure that services are pro-
vided to the poor.
Development work is
extremely interesting and
challenging, and can take you
all over the world. High lev-
els of enthusiasm, experience
and knowledge are normally
required. This is normally
very difficult. It is a bit of a
catch 22 situation – you can’t
get experience unless you
have it. But why shouldn’t
younger, inexperienced peo-
ple be able to help if they
want to? Surely younger peo-
ple would be ideal, as they
have more energy, less fear,
more enthusiasm, and are
not yet bothered about set-
tling down in one place and
starting a family.
Engineers Without Borders
UK (EWB) is a student-run
charity that aims to make
available the engineering
skills and knowledge of uni-
versity students to develop-
ing communities. It achieves
this by working with partner
NGOs (non-governmental
organisations) and send-
ing students on placements
with them over the summer
holidays. EWB coordinates
research projects for tech-
nologies that will benefit
developing world communi-
ties and provides bursaries to
students taking up their own
projects that are appropriate
to EWB’s aims.
Secondly, our aim is to raise
awareness and satiate curios-
ity about international devel-
opment. EWB UK operates
by having a core branch in
Cambridge and branches at
other universities. The EWB
Imperial College Branch was
foundedlastyear.EWBorgan-
ises talks on international
development and appropri-
ate technologies every other
week at Imperial College.
EWB has 36 engineering
related placements available
this summer (but not just for
engineers) in countries rang-
ing from India, Sri Lanka,
Nepal and Nigeria to the UK
and Spain.
EWB Imperial College
Branch is organising a train-
ing weekend from Friday 4
March to Sunday 6 March,
for students who are inter-
ested in going on a placement
or interested in development
work. The training weekend
will include talks and activi-
ties aiming to equip students
going on placements with
some extra skills and knowl-
edge that will help them in
a developing world environ-
ment. It will also raise aware-
ness of some of the issues
involved such as health and
safety, and will ensure that
the student is more prepared
for the work and what to
expect.
