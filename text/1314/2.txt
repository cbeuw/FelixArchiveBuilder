Last Friday in Beit Quad, an
auction of “second hand and
nearly new” bicycles raised
over £1000 towards facilities
for cyclists on campus.
The bicycles sold were orig-
inally left unclaimed when old
racks were removed last year.
The event was held in front of
a 50-strong crowd, with guest
auctioneer Edward Lord pre-
siding.
The pick of the bicycles
on offer was a Trek 7200FX
mountain bike, which attract-
ed a large amount of interest
from buyers and was eventu-
ally sold for £140.
Anyone interested in issues
affecting cyclists on campus
should contact benjamin.
