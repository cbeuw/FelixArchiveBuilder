The follow up to the hit Meet the
Parents (2000) is a light-hearted,
pun-terrific comedy with a sitcom-
style finishing cut. The comedy duo
formed by Stiller and De Niro is
back in an attempt to recreate the
success from the previous film, per-
haps falling a bit short of achiev-
ing the same levels of tear-jerking
humour as its predecessor.
We rejoin Gaylord Focker (Stiller)
and his fiancée Pam (Polo) as they
arrange for their parents to meet
before their wedding. Unfortunately
this involves Pam´s father, an
uptight ex-CIA agent (suitably
played by De Niro), meeting with
the Fockers, an eccentric couple
composed of a retired lawyer turned
hippy (Hoffman) and a sex therapist
(Streisand). Predictably, the mix
proves to be explosive, so that as
the two families spend a weekend
together on Focker Isle, you can
just sit back, relax and laugh at
how someone else has to deal with
in-laws that would make even yours
seem the epitome of charm.
The film is enjoyable enough, with
a multitude of recurring gags and
characters, targeting mainly an
audience that has already seen the
previous film, a viewing of which
is definitely recommended before
screening these “… Fockers”.
There are plenty of good jokes
in the movie, enough to keep you
chuckling away quite happily in
your seat. However it never quite
managed to draw a proper roar of
laughter from the audience. Most
of us felt quite safe, without risk of
having soda come out of our noses,
something unusual in Jay Roach
films (also director of the Austin
Powers series).
Watching the film produces a
viewing experience similar to
watching several episodes of any
of your favourite sitcoms in a row.
This involves a screenplay that
mostly fuses quick witted dialogue
with slapstick humour in a ‘real life’
situation. The main satisfaction to
obtain from this film is to find your-
self laughing at what could easily
be your worst nightmare (your in-
laws). On the down side, most gags
tend to revolve around the same top-
ics (how many Focker jokes could
one think of...?) and therefore end
up feeling a bit stale towards the end
of the movie.
However, the casting is brilliant
and the characters are at ease in
their parts. The on-screen chemis-
try between Stiller and De Niro is
palpable. One can easily relate to
Stiller’s nerves about impressing
his mistrusting in-laws and laugh at
his clumsiness, while sympatheti-
cally feeling the burn of De Niro’s
menacing eyes.
Ben Stiller is easily maintain-
ing himself well in the spotlight of
Hollywood comedy and has seen
2004 as one of his most successful
years so far.
De Niro’s career in the new mil-
lennium is also looking alive, as the
actor experiments with new genres.
He can’t help being type-cast as a
gangster/tough guy resulting from a
filmography full of mafia and action
movies. It appears, however, that
rather than slowing him down, he
is using this portrait to open a door
to new genres. Comedy films such
as the Meet the Parents series or
Analyse This and That exploit this
image fully.
The Fockers (Hoffman and
Streisand) easily mix into the final
recipe, along with a bundle of wacky
side characters, mischievous pets
and a perverted baby genius to com-
plete the picture.
Overall, if you liked Meet the
Parents, you will enjoy Meet the
Fockers. It adds new elements to
the series and will definitely make
you laugh. However, the film leaves
a slight feeling of disappointment
as the characters and the plot could
have been exploited more fully. Too
many ‘Focker’ jokes leave this film a
bit... well... ‘Fockered’.

One big happy Focking family
This train terminates here
For the first 20 minutes, I couldn’t
decide if this was supposed to be a
serious horror flick or a piss-take
from the Scary Movie school. I final-
ly decided on the former; it was just
the IC Dramsoc (no offence) level
of acting and completely unfeasible
plot that were implying the latter.
Kate (Portenta) misses the last
train while on the way to try to shag
George Clooney. She misses the
train because she falls asleep on a
London Underground platform. I’m
not sure how many girls would fall
asleep on a urine-stenched platform
while on a mission to bed Clooney.
But that’s a minor implausibility in
the script compared to other gaping
holes.
Kate can’t escape out onto the
street, but does manage to discov-
er a homeless person’s hideaway,
a record archive and a backstreet
operating theatre (with exemplary
hygiene standards, take note med-
ics). If you’re thinking of going to see
this because you’re fascinated by
what’s under your feet, may I instead
suggest reading Underground
London, by Stephen Smith.
Do you remember Kurt Neilson,
the Norwegian winner of World Pop
Idol? A geezer who could easily be
his slightly-more-deformed older
brother appears and attempts, in a
textbook horror movie way, to kill
everyone. Neilson’s brother, let’s
call him Goblin Boy (Christopher
Smith), appears to be missing Kurt’s
vocal genius. He starts off emitting
the howl of a jackal but criss-crosses
the entire animal kingdom, ending
bizarrely with a seal’s bark.
We don’t find out if Goblin Boy
is in fact a relative of Neilson,
as the reasons why a deformed
madman lives down the tube are
never explained. Although, worry-
ingly, we do see photo upon photo
of other similarly deformed chil-
dren... perhaps the Neilsons could
consider a different method of
contraception.
Maybe Kate, a German living
in London, is still practising her
English, but she must have “hello”
down by now. I lost count of the
number of times she banged on a
door or rattled some railings going
“hello, hello” in her slightly spooky
Germanic drool. If you go, could you
count for me and report back?
It really is a shame this is film is so
poor, because it’s a really good con-
cept, but they just haven’t done any-
thing with it: big killer rats (there
are a lot of the normal variety), or
a world of underground crime (both
literally and metaphorically).
The moral of the story is do not
fall asleep on public transport.
Unfortunately I’ve been doing this
with annoy regularity recently.
Luckily, I have as yet avoided a run-
in with either Neilson brother. But I
have been stuck in West Ruislip all
night. Rupert Neate
