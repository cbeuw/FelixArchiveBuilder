Imperial Men’s 2nd 20
Brunel Men’s 2nd 31
By Steve Barham
On a chilly day in mid-
January, the ever changing
gestalt that is the Second XV
arrived at Harlington for our
first match since December
against Brunel Seconds, cur-
rently placed second in our
league.
When the teams last
met in November, we were
comprehensively outplayed
by a well-drilled team, los-
ing by 67 points. Despite this,
we kept an upbeat attitude,
knowing that we were capa-
ble of better play, especially
with the legend that is Baby
Paul upgrading his shirt to
number 10.
From our kick-off, Brunel
ran back hard and fast to test
our all-new defensive regime,
which had been perfected
in ten minutes earlier on in
the day. Given that this was
sufficient last time to gift
them innumerable tries, they
were slightly put out to find
themselves stopped by the
chunky back line combo of Ed
Poulding and Alex Ferguson.
Some scrappy play on our 22
resulted in 15 consecutive
scrums, due to some moody
Brunel front row players
binding incorrectly.
Following this concerted
pressure, Brunel sneaked
in a try after a well-worked
backs move. After the restart,
determined defence and
some classy lineouts kept
Brunel pinned back in their
half of the pitch for quite
some time before they drove
over from a lineout to score
again. The rest of the half
progressed in the same vein,
until star winger Rob Phillips
snatched the ball mid-pass
on the Brunel 22 and skipped
over the line for his cheekiest
try yet.
The second half opened
with some slightly less glam-
orous play, gifting Brunel
some more easy points. The
prospect of conceding more
points seemed to wake up
the stirring beast that is the
Second XV, however, and
we replied with some of our
best play of the season, well
supported by a vocal crowd
of First XV players and
Virgins.
The entrance of Mark
brought some much needed
stability to the scrums, and
even Gareth’s 30 second
cameo seemed to cause
Brunel concern.
We scored two more tries,
both coming from lineouts.
In the first instance, your
humble narrator plucked the
ball from the lineout while
Brunel looked the other
way, yielding enough space
that even I could jog over
the line. Our next try came
from Charlie Davidson, who
despite being cuddled by
three Brunel players was
judged to have grounded the
ball cleanly.
The last minutes of the
match saw more pressure
which could have resulted in
another score, before some
fat mess of a prop grew tired
of Rich Bish and his rapid
penalties. Deciding that
rather than stop conceding
penalties they would simply
sit on his neck, a brief hia-
tus ensued while Imperial
Rugby’s campest EMT fondly
caressed Rich to ‘check for
spinal injury’.
Rather than risk perma-
nent injury, ‘Lucky’ Dave
Griffiths joined the fray at
scrum half to start his third
game for the club in two
years, following shoulder
damage at his fresher debut
and an injury for an external
club just before the start of
this season. Sadly, his luck
has yet to change, and he
suffered a nasty dislocation
in the final minute of the
match after some excellent
play. Bad luck Dave, and
thanks to the Virgins for
transporting him to Charing
Cross Hospital.
