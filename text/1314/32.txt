Imperial Men’s 3rd 7
UCL Men’s 3rd 1
By Perry Deu
It was the traditional ULU
fixture between Imperial
College and local rivals
UCL. Captain Mark Shatwell
dropped his 4-5-1 ‘continen-
tal’ formation and opted for a
very traditional 4-4-2 system
instead.
News was received that
UCL could only field nine
initial starting players, due
to injuries, with one player
shortly to arrive. However,
after kick off, the false sense
of security led to a few nerv-
ous moments for Imperial
early on. This was short lived
though, as the Thirds began
to improve after 15 minutes
of play, when the first real
chance of the game came.
The move started with
Dominic Booth picking up
the ball and playing it down
to Leon Thorne on the right
wing. Thorne skilfully col-
lected the ball and sent a long
pass to striker Perry Deu,
who brought down the ball
and whipped in a cross which
was narrowly missed by the
hard-working Matt Gready.
The resultant play led to a
corner, and Thorne whipped
a precise cross to find an
unmarked Gready, who gave
Imperial College a deserved
lead by hooking a shot past
the bewildered UCL goal-
keeper.
As the match wore on,
more success for Imperial
came down the right wing,
with Deu and Thorne linking
well to create many a break
through the UCL defence.
The arrival of the tenth
UCL player made no real dif-
ference, as a long ball from
Booth was controlled by
Perry, who flicked the ball
over the marking defender
and then swivelled past a
second man. Nakamoto col-
lected the ball, and the result-
ing shot shaved the crossbar.
Adam Williams and Anthony
Maule ensured that Imperial
College kept their guard up
until half time with their
aerial dominance. The now
legendary dolphin back four
of Shatwell, Ruso, Booth and
Tom Trump ensured Imperial
College feared no real danger
by ‘beefing’ out any attacks
and performing the odd
‘really big kick’ or handball
for good measure.
The second half saw
changes. John Slavin was
brought on for the injured
Gready, and Hasan Iqbal
replaced Adam Williams. The
half started vibrantly, as UCL
had to attack.
Imperial College seemed
in control of the match, but
a long clearance from UCL
defence caught goalkeeper
Lester napping, the resulting
long clearance bounced awk-
wardly and the UCL striker
seemed to punch the ball
into the net. The referee saw
nothing wrong, and the goal
stood.
With the score tied, Imperial
College now needed to push
for the lead again, which
came courtesy of Deu. Iqbal
picked out Thorne on the
wide left, who crossed into
the area. Deu flicked the ball
over his marker then over a
second defender, before driv-
ing the ball past the UCL
keeper, capping off a brilliant
Imperial College move.
This instant reply led to
wave upon wave of attacks,
which ravaged the UCL
defence. The third goal came
shortly afterwards, when
Nakamoto scored a brilliant
individual goal, picking up
the ball, skipping past two
defenders and striking the
ball from the edge of the area
into the top corner.
Thorne decided to match
Nakamoto, by picking up
the ball on the edge of the
area, cutting inside past two
players and striking the ball
past the UCL ‘keeper into
the roof of the net. The score
was now 4-1 and Imperial
College began to enjoy
themselves.
Goal number five came from
brilliant work from Iqbal, who
‘beefed’ past the UCL mid-
field to pick out Deu on the
corner of the 18 yard area,
who then drilled the ball first
time into the UCL net.
The sixth goal came cour-
tesy of Dominic Booth, again
after good work by Iqbal.
To round off an all-round
great game, Nakamoto
broke down the right wing
into the UCL penalty area,
then unselfishly cut the ball
back for the onrushing Deu
to complete his hat-trick and
produce a man of the match
performance.
Keeping his eye on the ball: striker Perry Deu (back row, centre) is distracted at the vital moment, but that didn’t stop
him scoring a hat-trick in Imperial Thirds’ 7-1 thrashing of UCL last week
