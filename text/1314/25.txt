Think Floyd: pick Mason
Martin Smith, Books Editor, takes a trip to the dark side to explore some Floydian theory
Books books.felix@ic.ac.uk
Christmas 2004 saw two differ-
ent drummers from world famous
prehistoric rock bands give their
thoughts in book format. However,
while Ringo Starr dug out his loft
only to find some Postcards from
the Boys, Nick Mason has managed
to offload the entire story of Pink
Floyd into one beautiful hardback
book.
For those of you who skim-read
the first paragraph, Pink Floyd are,
or perhaps were, a very success-
ful band that your Dad listened to
while smoking dope in the sixties,
seventies and beyond. Actually, my
Dad wasn’t much of a fan, but I’m
making up for his philistine tenden-
cies by becoming the greatest fan
of Pink Floyd the world has ever
known.
Pink Floyd are most famous
for their 1973 album Dark Side of
the Moon, which at one point was
claimed to exist in three out of four
record collections. And rightly so:
it’s fantastic. Other things you may
be aware of are their enigmatic
album covers, which have included
cows, light refraction and Battersea
power station. It is for this reason
in particular that, even being the
die-hard fan that I am, I could still
walk past Messrs Mason, Gilmour,
Waters and Wright without even
recognising them. I’m just proud I
remember their names. Very few
later albums featured pictures of the
band, and even at the time Mason
recalls gangs of photographers still
poised with their fingers on the
buttons well after they had got off
the plane, unlike the Beatles and
Ringo Starr. This makes this per-
sonal account all the more interest-
ing, as tabloid newspapers haven’t
been gossiping about their rivalries
and musical differences. They just
weren’t pretty enough.
Nick Mason had the pleasure of
being part of the ‘Pink Floyd Sound’
from the very beginning and to the
very end. Several key band mem-
bers came and went in the 30 years
or so that Pink Floyd performed, for
musical or mental health reasons,
and Mason documents their com-
ings and goings from the relative
safety of his drum throne. One of
the most interesting things about
the Floyd is the way in which their
music changes over time: musi-
cal ‘phases’ are certainly identifi-
able from one member leaving and
another taking control. It’s a heart-
warming story of a a group of fail-
ing architects who decide to pick
up some musical instruments and
begin to hate each other.
I was quite surprised at the way
this book was written. Mason, whilst
observing the happenings of the
sixties and seventies, appears to
have avoided any of the mind-bend-
ing pharmaceuticals of the period,
and so is presumably one of the
few musicians of the era who can
remember what happened. Whether
or not this is to protect his children
from seeing his naughty side, we
still get a good account of the psych-
edelia but from a remarkably sober
perspective. He also manages to
answer the question ‘Where did the
band get its name’ without making
you feel as though he’s explained a
thousand times before. The answer,
for use in pub quizzes, is that it’s a
mixture of two blues artists, Pink
Anderson and Floyd Council, who
were favoured by Syd Barrett at
the time. I think that question even
came up in Trivial Pursuit once.
Something else that you can’t fail
to pick up from this book is the
fact that Nick is far more inter-
ested in music technology, cars and
motor racing than he is in drums.
He focuses on the technological
improvements that allowed Pink
Floyd to continue to put on the
best light shows of every period and
produce the most refined sound in
rock history.
The book is a delight to read.
It’s huge and weighs a ton (much
like a Floyd tour) and is decorated
with hundreds of photos, some of
which make their first appearance
here from his personal collection.
Its glossy pages and Floydian cover,
courtesy of Storm Thorgerson, are
a joy to behold, and these alone
would make it a fantastic coffee
table book for anyone wanting to
look musically cultured. However, if
this is your thing, I can well recom-
mend Mind Over Matter, an equal-
ly well presented and significantly
cheaper book which documents the
images of Pink Floyd, in particular
album covers that were consistently
provided by Storm over the band’s
lifetime.
If you’re after the full story
from the man holding the sticks/
fourtrack/racing helmet then this
is the book to buy. Start saving now:
I was lucky enough to convince my
Dad to spend the £30 to make it an
excellent Christmas present. I take
it all back.
Inside Out: A Personal
History of Pink Floyd

Uganda in 1977, Afghanistan 1980,
El Salvador 1981, Kosovo 1999 and
Iraq 2003 were not popular tourist
destinations, yet these are some of
the places Jon Snow has visited
during a remarkable news report-
ing career, and after reading his
autobiography, you almost feel sorry
for him stuck behind a desk fronting
Channel 4 News.
Shooting History is a fascinating,
honest, and at times moving account
of Snow’s journalist life which adds
up to more than just an autobi-
ography. For anyone interested in
foreign news reporting, it is – yes – a
‘must read’. Rich with anecdotes of
frontline bullet-dodging and being
arrested in obscure corners of the
world, it also informs us of what
overseas news gathering was like
before reliable telephone networks
and the internet.
But this book is also an historical
account of the Cold War and its con-
sequences from a unique viewpoint.
As a foreign news reporter who
became Washington correspond-
ent then diplomatic editor for ITN,
Snow had a ring-side seat as the
major events of the late 20th century
unfolded. Throughout this autobiog-
raphy, he persuasively argues that
the West helped create the Islamist
terrorist threat that so preoccupies
it today – from El Salvador, Iran
and Afghanistan to 9/11, Shooting
History describes how all the pieces
moved together to create our cur-
rent world disorder and the war on
terror.
The son of an Anglican bishop,
Snow begins his book at the large
family residence before describing
the choir-boy schooling that failed
to get him the grades he needed for
university. Instead, he travelled to
Uganda on VSO, where he spent a
year teaching in a remote Catholic
school.
The book vividly describes Snow’s
life in rural Africa and how he set-
tled into his teacher role in the com-
munity. Desperately sad to leave,
the experience obviously had a
great impact on him and appears
to have sown the first seeds of a
potential journalism career: a reali-
sation of the injustice in the world
made him determined to return to
the country to report back on it.
Interestingly, while serving VSO, he
encountered an extremely large,
ambitious Ugandan general fresh
out of Sandhurst at a local box-
ing tournament. It was a few years
before Snow got another chance to
meet Idi Amin and interview him, by
which time the Uganda he returned
to was almost unrecognisable from
the country he had fallen in love
with.
Upon returning from Africa,
Snow started a degree at Liverpool
University. He makes no secret of
the fact that it was his father’s con-
tacts that got him onto a course,
but unfortunately they did not bear
fruit. Snow remains degree-less to
this day, his time at Liverpool having
come to an abrupt end following his
involvement with a student protest
that culminated in a takeover of
a university building. Although not
responsible for raising the red flag
on its roof, Snow was accused of
being one of the ringleaders respon-
sible for the demonstration and was
suspended.
Followingaheart-breakingaccount
of a stint at a London homeless
charity, the book goes on to describe
Snow’s first media break at LBC
radio, and from then on takes us on
a journey of foreign news reporting
across Central America, the Middle
East and Africa. During this period,
Snow gained first-hand experience
of fighting amongst the Cold War’s
political pawns as he reported on
El Salvador, Iran-Iraq and Somalia.
Later, as ITN’s Washington and then
diplomatic correspondent, Snow
reported on the Reagan-Gorbachov
summits and the fall of the Berlin
Wall from the unique position of hav-
ing directly experienced the effects
of cold war tensions on the ground.
Throughout his career, his list
of interviewees is impressive and
includes Gorbachov, Reagan and
the Pope. But perhaps standing out
most is Nelson Mandela, who, as
the new president of South Africa,
gave his first interview to Jon Snow.
Obviously a proud moment, it also
seems somehow fitting because
Snow was arrested and charged
following protests for Mandela’s
release at an England-South Africa
rugby match during his student
days years earlier.
Throughout Shooting History,
Snow is candid – and not just in
acknowledging his luck and the
“I think your father taught me at
Eton” connections that served him
well. We hear his genuine regret at
the way the press ignored Rwanda
until over a million people had been
killed in its mass genocide. He, like
the rest of the world’s media, was
scrambling after Monica Lewinsky.
While the world was obsessed by
a young White House intern and
“the Dress”, the hundreds of bodies
washing up on the shores of Lake
Victoria went largely unreported.
The book finishes with a passion-
ate plea for the UN dream to be
rekindled, and a heavy criticism
of George Bush’s foreign policies.
Here, Snow’s feeling of impotency
as a newsreader becomes apparent
as he grabs his chance to explicitly
say what he thinks about the war on
Iraq. This is not an anti-American
rant: it is obvious from the book that
when living there as Washington
correspondent he loved America, its
people and the ideologies on which
the country was founded. Perhaps
that is why he is so disturbed by
the direction in which America is
headed.
Shooting History is not only a
fascinating autobiography, but also
an insightful commentary on the
latter half of the cold war and the
challenges we face today. From his
unique news reporting experiences,
Jon Snow has attempted to put our
current war on terror into the wider
context of cold war history – and
succeeded.
