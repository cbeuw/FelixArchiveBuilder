It has been a while, but I am pleased
to say that my faith in Hollywood
action films has been restored. For
when it comes down to good old-
fashioned good guys versus bad
guys with lots of heroics and guns,
Assault on Precinct 13 delivers the
goods.
A battered cop is charge of an
equally battered police station that
is ‘enjoying’ its last night before
permanently closing its doors. That
this last night is New Years Eve dur-
ing a nasty snowstorm means that
it is going to be one long and hell-
ish night for those trapped inside.
And as mysterious forces try to get
inside to kill the big time gangster in
the cells, all concerned have to put
their issues aside if they are going
to make it to the morning.
The story revolves around Marion
Bishop, a ruthless and intelligent
gangster who has been arrested for
killing a policeman. He and three
other small time criminals are
forced to spend the night in Precinct
13 when a freak blizzard causes
them to take a detour. Also spending
the night are the two policemen on
duty, a feisty secretary and a slightly
neurotic female psychologist.
Bishop, played by Fishburne is
coolly detached from those around
him, and Fishburne has the pres-
ence needed to carry off this new age
gangster. He just looks innately evil
– a very bad man who you wouldn’t
want to meet on a dark night down a
dark alley. His motivation is survival
at any cost and you know that some-
where down the line he is going to
make a break for freedom.
All this contrasts beautifully with
our hero, Jake Roenick (Hawke),
a young cop still reeling from a
traumatic incident involving lots of
gunfire and the deaths of some of his
friends. His therapist thinks he is
now hiding from the world behind a
desk and losing himself in drugs and
alcohol. She may just be right. Still,
we know better, because as soon as
the chips are down, Jake turns into
a super-duper champion of champi-
ons, risking his own neck to save the
lives of those innocents (and crooks)
at the mercy of those outside. It
is clichéd and corny I know, but I
enjoyed it just the same.
So what follows is a heady mixture
of explosions, gunshots through the
head – yes it is that violent – and
many utterances of “we’re not going
to make it, are we?” It goes without
saying that in this kind of movie,
most of them aren’t going to.
As I watched the cast dwindle in
number in various interesting and
inventive ways, the question I asked
myself is “do I really care?” Well,
the director does do lot to create
three-dimensional characters that
are both gritty and realist. He suc-
ceeds with the main characters but
falls behind with a few of the auxil-
iary cast.
The most disappointing is Gabriel
Byrne’s character, who suffers from
a serious lack of development – his
corrupt cop comes across as totally
unconvincing and flat. As with many
movies of this genre, a few chuckles
are needed to lighten the violent
atmosphere. Here John Leguizamo
is entertaining as a drugged-up
ex-lawyer whose sparing partner
is adequately played by Jeffery ‘Ja
Rule’ Atkins, who also provides a
bad-ass title soundtrack for the
movie. The director Jean-Francois
Richet nicely blends the action with
the dialogue, although there is much
more action than anything else.
It is Ethan Hawke’s perform-
ance as the lead that seals the deal
for me. Now fully immersed in the
action drama genre, Hawke has
the ‘washed up policeman with a
conscience’ down to a tee. I would
love to see him in more roles like
this, but I have the feeling that he
will soon return to more serious
drama.
As the story unwinds, a claus-
trophobic air is built up with many
tight shots of scared faces and some
slightly jumpy camera work. Tension
is built up as the characters seem to
be sinking deeper into trouble with
no way out. Still, I was drawn into
their struggle for survival that for-
tunately was not too drawn out; a
tendency of action films these days
is to plug on for at least two hours
trying to reach some logical conclu-
sion and often failing to do so.
Luckily this doesn’t happen here,
and although you can guess what
is going to happen at the film’s end,
the journey there is still definitely
worth watching. Yes it is violent, and
without question bloody, but it’s still
a lot of fun too.

Quite literally ‘off the cuff’
Well Fock me Sideways
Wine-loving wannabe writer Miles
(Paul Giamatti) is taking failed actor
Jack (Haden Church) on a week-
long tour of California’s Santa Ynez
Valley wine region to celebrate his
old friend’s upcoming marriage.
While Miles downs glass after
glass of pinot noir, ruminating on
how difficult it is to grow that grape,
Jack is determined to get laid one
last time before settling down, so
he hustles Stephanie (Sandra Oh),
the wine pourer. Actually he seems
to be hustling anything in a skirt for
that one last fling. Who is he going
to find to have casual sex with?
He even convinces sad sack Miles
to try his luck with Maya (Virginia
Madsen), a sympathetic, wine-savvy
waitress. Miles steals money from
his mother to pay for his share of the
wine, restaurants, and rooms. A pair
of great guys?
Predictably, Jack gets into trouble.
Equally predictably, Miles comes to
the rescue while saving himself from
a mid-life crisis. These two charac-
ters are polar opposites: the crass
actor and the sensitive writer, linked
by being roommates at college, but
by little else these days. Adapted
by director Alexander Payne and
Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex
Pickett, Sideways’ subtext is about
fading youth and unfulfilled poten-
tial, which is as depressing as a
holiday film can get.
After seeing the trailer for the film,
I was very apprehensive about going
to see it. Unfortunately watching the
movie only confirmed my suspicions.
I didn’t like the characters and I
didn’t care about what happened to
them. But towards the end, the film
becomes funny in an unexpected
way. Jack might be a fool, but he is
honest about it. He is so disarmingly
funny that you excuse his behav-
iour – he’s just a self-involved actor.
Miles, on the other hand, is someone
to avoid at all costs. He is hunched
over, depressed, angry, vengeful, and
an unattractive little man.
There’s something quite home
movie about the style of this film,
and I loved the laid back sunny shots
of the wine valley and the guys driv-
ing around. Sadly I’m still confused
about the poor tribute to The Brady
Bunch – split screen effects aren’t
always a good idea. I’m not sure if
Payne was trying to emphasise the
laid back attitude of the area with
the style and pace of the film, but
perhaps the film’s pace was too slow.
It was supposed to cover a week yet
it felt like it was covering months
and months of their lives. I lost count
of the amount of times I was check-
ing my watch.
The main problem I have with
this film is that it was full of lots
of very cheap jokes that you will
have heard and seen before. Did we
really need to see a fat ugly naked
guy with his pathetic excuse for
manhood pressed against the car
window? Or the fat ugly naked guy
having sex with his fat ugly naked
wife?!
I have to admit I did find parts
quite funny and the rest of the audi-
ence seemed to love the film. It has
been nominated for awards, so I
guess I’m in the minority on this
one. What annoys me is that most of
the movie was handled so clumsily
that it lost some of its impact. The
only saving grace is near the end
when Payne directs some of the
more poignant scenes.
I’m not sure if it’s just my age
that’s preventing me from appre-
ciating this film (a couple of forty-
something losers aren’t my idea of
entertainment) – I don’t understand
the hype. It’s not a great movie, just
an average one. Haj Alttahir
