Hello again! I think you deserve
a bit of a break, after the chal-
lenges of my last barred puzzle and
last week’s musical puzzle from
Jabberwock. This week’s is also
thematic, but the clues are fairly
straightforward – verging on the
boring in several cases, for which
I apologise – and the puzzle should
be solvable. I hope you enjoy the
penny-dropping moment when the
theme falls into place.
1 and 5 across are unclued and
provide the theme. The other the-
matic elements are contained in
the perimeter answers and in the
central square. When sending in
your solution, you needn’t do any-
thing with the central square, but
you should briefly explain its signifi-
cance. Good luck! Snufkin
