ALBUM REVIEW
I can tell what most of you are
thinking after looking at the title.
You’re thinking: “Gruff Rhys, lead
singer and songwriter of the Super
Furry Animals, has just produced
a solo album, but it’s written
entirely in Welsh.” And since there
are only about five people in the
entire world who can fluently under-
stand this Celtic language, you
might think you won’t be able to get
it. Right?
Wrong! The genius of Gruff’s
work, as shown with the Super
Furry’s output, is his ability to make
immediately catchy, and occasion-
ally beautiful music, combining ele-
ments of the Beach Boys and other
assorted 60’s pop with the epic view
of 70’s prog bands like Pink Floyd,
without dragging it out into preten-
tious drivel. Plus, a quick look on
his website (www.placidcasual.com)
will give you an overview on what
he’s singing about.
Here you’ll learn that he’s up to
his usual tricks of writing songs
which tackle modern issues in his
own lopsided way, or creating his
own idealised world. Take Epynt,
named after a Welsh mountain, but
is cleverly twisted into a Pound vs.
Euro song (His conclusion? “…it’s
better to get rid of money altogeth-
er”), which will lodge itself into your
brain with its shouty chorus.
Further songs will reveal the
knack he has for creating unique
pop music. Rhagluniaeth Ysgafn
(loosely translated at May My
Destiny Be Easily Digested), with
its cutting guitars, organ parts and
random soft toy squeaking providing
a backing to his confession. Ni Yw Y
Byd (We Are The World), which may
seem like an innocent song about
uniting the world, but hides refer-
ences to revolution and confusing
your enemies.
The areas that stand out from this
album are the mini-stories that run
through it, adding an extra depth
to the album, which is not usually
present elsewhere. Pwdin _y (Egg
Pudding) provides a two part tale
about falling in love with a woman
called Egg Pudding. The first part is
a bouncy song reflecting the lust at
the start of the relationship, whilst
the morose second part reflects
the crumbling relationship and the
death of Ms. Pudding. It feels truly
tragic with Gruff’s off-key voice
juxtaposed with the slow arpeggios
– a testament to the strong musical
craftsmanship on display.
The other tale is about living in
and leaving Caerffosiaeth (Sewage
City), starting off with a Kraftwerk-
inspired electronic montage trans-
forming into a beautiful conclusion
complete with layered vocals and
car noises as he’s travelling away
from and missing his home.
Even the weakest moments, such
as the plodding conclusion, are
strong enough not to dampen the
enjoyment you can get from the
album. I’ve been playing this lo-fi
gem constantly this week. I recom-
mend you get yourself a copy and
see for yourself what makes it so
addictive.

SINGLE REVIEW
The new generation of skinny pop
rockers is currently flooding the
charts. Loved by kids and adults
alike for their catchy guitar hooks
and melodic vocals, there seems
to be an endless demand for bands
suchasTheKillers,FranzFerdinand
and The Others.
Cue The Vacation, strutting
straight out of LA with their debut
single, already praised by the ever-
popular Jet. Destitute Prostitutes
may not have the universal appeal
of its contemporaries, which is
probably due to Ben Tegel’s explic-
it description of Hollywood’s illicit
industry.
The single uses a standard formu-
la: rhythm-heavy guitars, bluesy riffs
and stripped down drums. Sounding
like the plucky love child of Amen
and The Von Bondies, Destitute
Prostitutes is a strange mix, but it
is thrashed out with charisma and
superb vocals that transform what
should be a run-of-the-mill track
into a cocky display of rock’n’roll.
Worth a second listen, the sounds
of The Vacation are promising and
have already wowed UK audiences
at Leeds and Reading festivals. We
eagerly await the follow-up album.
