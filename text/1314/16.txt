What squeals, wears little
clothing and loves to give
money to charity? A ‘Girls
Night In’ of course!
Just to keep your faith in
Imperial College, some peo-
ple really do have fun here
– the girls! The event was
organised by the Pinks Social
Club (Pinks for short), which
raised money for Breast
Cancer Care. The night was
a huge success, raising over
£1000. Aleks Corr, the host-
ess with the most-est of the
night, was ecstatic with the
result and claims that a big-
ger and better ‘Girls Night In’
is planned for next year!
The night started off with
an insightful talk by Marcia,
a volunteer from the Breast
Cancer Care Charity, about
her past experience of the
disease and how the char-
ity helps to support everyone
affected by breast cancer. It
was a very thought provoking
talk, and I’m sure everyone
learnt something.
The fun and games came
along when Ann Summers
hit the stage. The first game
proved what many of us
already knew, that a cer-
tain Pink lady was donned
‘Slapper of the Night’ in an ‘I
have never’ style game (but a
lot more fun and without the
dirty pintage). Sexy models
Alex, Sam and Kitty strut-
ted their funky stuff on the
stage with gorgeous lingerie
– a brave thing to do, with so
many girls in the room.
Next came what guys
know as their enemies – sex
toys (and plenty were sold)
– before another entertain-
ing game that accompanied
this with lots of volunteers.
I’d like to say thank you to
Henrietta (Ann Summers
lady) for putting on a fan-
tastic show, which everyone
thoroughly enjoyed.
As the hostess proceeded
to obtain more Dutch cour-
age, the male auction took
off. The Pinks would like to
thank these brave, brave
men who were willing to sell
themselves in skimpy thongs
to the rabble: Steve Barham,
Mike Hicks, Tom Nieto and
Ben Anstiss made a total of
£280. Well done boys, we hope
you enjoy your time with your
buyers!
Next was the raffle, with
superb prizes. The Pinks
would like to thank all our
sponsors for their gener-
ous donations: Odeon,
Wagamama, Lush, NYNC,
Casa Art, and of course, Ann
Summers. Well done to those
who won the prizes – I’m so
jealous!
The last of the entertain-
ment came in the form of
Blind Date – Cilla style! Yet
again, thank you to the mem-
bers of the opposite sex who
volunteered their time with
such courage: Andy Easter,
Tim Praill, Gary Flanagan
and Serge Lioutyi. Also,
a big thank you to Vicky
Arbabzadah who was brave
enough to ask the question
“If you were a sex toy, what
would you be and why?” Well
done girl!
The two lucky couples
(Libby and Andy, Vicky and
Tim) will be enjoying meals
with wine in the Giraffe and
Sopranos restaurants down
on High Street Kensington.
We hope that the blind dates
go well – keep us posted!
The party moved on to The
Prospect on Fulham Road.
If you know anything about
that bit of the night, please
contact us, as we do not have
a clue!
There was one low point to
the evening. One out of two
white pin boxes went missing
at about 9–10.30pm. If anyone
knows of its whereabouts, the
Pinks would be ever so grate-
ful for its return, as it had
quite a bit of money in, which
we would like to donate to
Breast Cancer Care.
All in all, an absolutely
fabulous time was had by
everyone – I haven’t seen a
room full of so many giggly
girls since secondary school!
Remember girls, if you pur-
chased anything from Ann
Summers, you can collect it
from us now – just email us at
pinks_imperial@yahoo.co.uk.
If any girls would like to join
the Pinks Social Club, please
feel free to come along to any
of our events – we’re usually
found in the Union in South
Kensington on a Thursday
night. You don’t have to be a
drinker at all, just a girl who
knows how to have fun! We
also love organising charity
events, so if you want to help
out or have some ideas, give
us a bell!
Lastly, thank you to all
those who came to the ‘Girls
Night In’. This event wouldn’t
have been anything without
your support or enthusiasm
(yes guys, there are girls at
Imperial!)
Go Girl Power!

Girls just wanna have fun!
By Elizabeth Sawyer
Loading rucksacks into the
back of a minibus, making the
obligatory stops in Egham
and Warwick, and some crazy
roundabout experiences en-
route – it had to be another
Fellwanderers trip, destina-
tion: Snowdonia!
We arrived (eventually) at
St Mary’s hut and tried to
sleep, but downstairs there
was some serious wood chop-
ping going on. Still, revenge
came on Saturday morning,
when we got up at six to start
walking. The mad midnight
axemen didn’t find things so
funny then...
On Saturday, we walked
up Snowdon, starting on the
miners’ track, then swapping
to a nameless (not a good
sign) path, before eventu-
ally meeting Watkin near
the top. Tom proved his
navigational excellence by
guiding us through the inside
of a cloud all the way up and
down the mountain – no
easy taskwhen you can’t see
more than five metres in any
direction.
Cold and damp, we fin-
ished the day in Pete’s Eats
in Llanberris, before head-
ing back to the hut for some
Outdoor Club strength chilli,
some cooling banoffee pie,
and some near-traumas
involving buses, farmers and
sheep (OK, I lied about the
sheep).
Sunday was another wet
day. We split the group, and
half did Snowdon again (via
a different route) whilst the
other half decided it might
be more interesting to see
some lower level stuff: dis-
used slate mines, an old for-
tress, each other (something
that had not been possible
the previous day due to the
enveloping cloud).
Jutta put up an especially
brave fight against the condi-
tions, which had even the dri-
est of us uncomfortable and
necessitated that Chris pur-
chase some trousers. Anyone
at the Union on Thursday 20th
will recognise how desperate-
ly cold and wet we must have
been – what else could have
driven Chris to this moment
of insanity?
Anyway, back to Imperial via
the pub and Staines (a pleas-
ant change from Egham) and
that was our trip over. I think
it’s fair to say that, despite
the weather, a good time was
had by all.

“Who’ll start me at 20 pence?” This male student looks as
though he’s thoroughly enjoying being auctioned off...
