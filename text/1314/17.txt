Hopefully you already know
that IC Radio is Imperial’s
very own student-run radio
station. We broadcast 24
hours a day from our studios
in the showbiz hub that is the
Beit Quad Media Centre, also
home to Felix (apparently it’s
a newspaper) and alleged tel-
evision station STOIC.
So why are we suddenly
wanting to talk to you? Well,
it’s that time of year when
everyone is fed up with their
degrees (or is that just me?),
and we noticed a few gaps in
our schedule just waiting to
be filled by good folks like you.
Within a matter of weeks you
could be presenting your very
own radio show.
Wedon’tmindwhatit’sabout
or what kind of music you play.
The beauty of student radio is
that we’re not constrained to
a particular genre like ‘real’
stations are – we have shows
ranging from mainstream
pop and R’n’B to hard rock
and dance, with everything
in between. If talk is more
your thing, we’ve got that too,
including a wide range of sci-
ence programming for those
of you that can’t get enough!
Behind the scenes, IC Radio
is constantly expanding and
improving its facilities. Soon
you will be able to hear us in
the Union and JCR, and we’ll
be able to record live band
sessions in our refurbished
production studio.
With so many big changes
around the corner, not least
the imminent destruction
of Southside, we’re hold-
ing a development meeting
TONIGHT (Thursday) to
discuss the direction the sta-
tion will be taking over the
next few years. Where will we
broadcast? What kind of shiny
things should we be buying?
Should we change the logo?
You know, earth shattering
stuff!
Plus it will soon be time to
decide who is going to run the
station next year, so if that
appeals to you, now is the
time to get involved.
As an extra enticement,
after our meeting we’ll retire
to the Union for the evening
and free beer will be avail-
able for all paid-up members.
IC Radio membership costs
just £8 for the year – and you
could easily recoup that in
free beer!
So join us at 6pm tonight in
the Media Centre Common
Room (Beit Quad, West Wing
basement – swipe through the
doors, down the stairs, left
and left again).
Starting next week, we’ll
introduce you to some of the
shows currently on IC Radio,
and explain why they deserve
your attention. In the mean-
time, don’t forget to turn up
tonight, or to tune in – we’re
on 999AM in Southside and
Linstead halls and on 1134AM
across the Wye campus
(thanks to the IC Trust). You
can also listen online and
download shows from the
archive at www.icradio.com.
IC RADIO
Turn on, tune in... free beer!
By Alex Jermstad
One of Imperial’s new-
est and fastest growing
clubs and societies is ICU-
PAIN, which aptly stands
for Paintball Association,
Imperial Nutcases. Their
first main event as a club was
to compete in the first Inter-
University paintball tourna-
ment to be held in England
for over two years.
On an extremely cold, dark
morning back in November,
a ten-strong team piled into
numerous cars and mini-vans
to begin the joyous two hour
trek up to Birmingham for a
fun-filled day of paint, sweat
and mud! I, in my infinite wis-
dom, decided to travel up the
previous night and sleep a
mere 20 minutes away from
the site... only to receive a
‘wake-up call’ from the club
president at 5.30am! That
guaranteed him a little friend-
ly fire later in the day.
Upon arrival, we were
greeted with the site of hun-
dreds of other obviously quite
sick people looking for a day
of running around in the
woods and getting shot at.
The team were all issued with
some very fashionable over-
alls, a standard Tippmann 98
paintball marker (we don’t
use guns, for all you PC peo-
ple out there) and a rather
hefty bag of 500 paintballs to
get us started.
After a comprehensive
introduction to paintball for
those who had never played
before, and a safety briefing,
the marshals led us deep into
the wood, where the games
began. Now, the object of the
game is, of course, to elimi-
nate the opposition. One hit
anywhere on your person or
equipment and you’re outta
there. If a paintball bounces,
however, you’re still in the
game. Each team is awarded
five points for capturing the
opposition’s flag and return-
ing it to their home base with-
in the ten minute time limit.
You get one point for a draw
(when no-one captures either
flag), and no points for a loss.
Our first match was up
against the hosts of the
tournament, Birmingham
University. The field was
called ‘Beeches’, with a great
decommissioned helicopter
as a large centrepiece. As we
were playing on their home
ground and we had a scratch
team, we naturally had to
show Birmingham what we
were made of.
Our opponents put up an
admirable fight until the last
minute, when a key Imperial
player flanked all the way
around the left to surprise
them, taking out the remains
of their defence and return-
ing the flag (Imperial 5,
Birmingham 0). Oh yeah!
Our morale-boosting start
was followed up by a much
swifter victory on the ‘Swamp’
field against Coventry,
then another astounding
win against the extremely
sneaky Southampton team on
‘Rolling Rock’. I think it’s fair
to say we were definitely on a
roll by this time.
At lunch, we replenished
all our spent energy with a
few delicious burgers and hot
dogs washed down with some
soda – the true paintball
athlete’s diet. After maxing
every match so far, the talk
around the water cooler was
that we were indestructible.
Either way, we had already
secured our place in the final,
no matter what the outcome
of the post-lunch Warwick
match was.
So as not to taint our perfect
record, we felt obliged to kick
some more ass when taking
on Warwick in the extremely
atmospheric ‘Temple’ field,
complete with 30ft Aztec
temple and thick brush! It
was close, but no cigar for
Warwick. The standings after
the heats were as follows,
with every team getting an
extra five points for a ‘bye’
game:
Imperial 25
Birmingham 16
Southampton 16
Coventry 10
Warwick 5
Following all of the
heats, Southampton and
Coventry battled it out for
third and fourth place, with
Southampton coming out
on top. Then came the final
decider, Imperial versus
Birmingham (cue atmos-
pheric fight scene music). We
unknowingly chose ‘Bridges’
as the field to play, not real-
ising that Birmingham had
already stormed Warwick
on that same field earlier in
the day! It was a very close
match, with members of both
teams being taken out left
right and centre. However,
just as our left flank was about
to break through to grab
Birmingham’s flag and claim
victory, the whistle blew and
it was all over. Birmingham
had made a strong flanking
manoeuvre down the opposite
side, breaking through our
defence and snatching our
flag without us even realising
it. Imperial 0, Birmingham 5.
All in all, an awesome day
was had by all, and it was
a great start to the year for
ICU-PAIN.
The event was proudly
sponsored by Just Paintball,
who provided a new pair of
goggles to each of the play-
ers in the first placed team!
The second placed team
(Imperial) received over
£100 in vouchers for the Just
Paintball shop (we have some
new team jerseys on the
way!)
A big thank you goes out
to all the teams, particularly
Birmingham for arranging
the great day. Thanks also
to the Birmingham lads and
Portsmouth dude who helped
us to make up numbers.
If you’d like to try your hand
at paintball then we will hope-
fully be organising monthly
events from now on, the
first being on Wednesday 9
February. Please see www.
