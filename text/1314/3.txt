Gillette succumbs to P&G bid
As P&G bids for Gillette to make it the largest consumer products
manufacturer, Kabir Merali analyses the deal with a fine-tooth comb
On Friday 28 January, the
American firm Proctor and
Gamble made a $57bn (£30bn)
bid to buy Gillette, a move
that would create the world’s
large consumer products
firm, overtaking the Anglo-
Dutch firm Unilever. The
combined firm could have
revenues of over $60bn a year.
“We believe we can bring
these companies together and
create a juggernaut,” Gillette
chief executive James Kilts
said.
The two firms have 21 prod-
ucts worth over $1bn a year
and own some of the best
known consumer brands in
the world. From Mach 3 shav-
ing products to Head and
Shoulders shampoo, from
Duracell batteries to Pringles
crisps, the new firm will have
it covered.
The two firms’ product
ranges complement each
other – P&G’s brands include
many products appealing to
women with its wide range
of beauty and hair care prod-
ucts, while Gillette is a leader
in the male grooming prod-
ucts sector.
By combining the two firms’
product ranges, they will have
a much higher combined
marketing budget and so will
be able to get better deals
from media and advertising
companies.
In recent times, supermar-
ket chains have grown much
larger and have pushed their
suppliers to give them dis-
counts on many products.
Wal-Mart, with 8% of the US
retail market, and Tesco, with
12% of the British retail mar-
ket, have been very aggres-
sive in driving down prices
from their suppliers.
P&G and Gillette hope to
be able to use their combined
power to shift the balance of
power with supermarkets,
and use their combined size
to get better prices and better
supermarket shelf space.
The two firms also hope to
makethemostofglobalisation
by combining their strengths.
P&G has a strong presence
in emerging economies such
as China and Russia and will
use this to promote Gillette’s
products. With the Chinese
consumer products market
looking to grow at 5-6% a
year, P&G hope to increase
revenue by over $350m just
by selling Gillette’s brands
there.
All in all, P&G hopes to cut
costs by $16bn a year, mainly
by getting rid of 6,000 staff,
which represents 4% of the
new company’s workforce.
They also hope to raise oper-
ating margins from 19% to
25% by the end of the decade.
Warren Buffet, who owns
9% of Gillette, has called it a
dream deal. He plans to buy
further into the new merged
company.
While the deal looks like a
match made in heaven, espe-
cially since the two firms are
located so close to each other
and thus will avoid the cul-
tural issues of integrating a
cross border workforce, there
are a few potential pitfalls. By
growing through acquisition
to such a large size, there
may be problems managing
a company of this size. This
merger is much bigger than
the purchase of Wella and
Clairol, other recent acquisi-
tions that P&G have made.
Some have also suggest-
ed that there is not much
room for extra profits from
Gillette’s brands – consum-
ers are unlikely to pay more
money for more blades on
their razor, and Gillette’s
Duracell is under pressure
from lower cost rivals.
By making a $57bn offer for
Gillette, P&G are paying an
18% premium over the stock
market valuation of the firm.
While this is generous, it is
less than the 21% average
premium offered in takeover
deals since 2001.
Many analysts predict
that this will be the start of
a merger frenzy in the con-
sumer products sector.
By creating such a large
combined firm, competitors
are going to worry about their
own future. They will look to
merge just to keep up with
the new firm. Speculation has
driven up the share price of
the French lighter, razor and
pen manufacturer Bic and
the British cleaning products
firm Reckitt Benckiser.
Mr Kilts, who will become
the vice-president of the new
firm, has said that he would
rather lead this round of
mergers than “get stuck with
the leftovers”.

European equities fly
Follwing the ‘successful’ elec-

ties reached two year highs.
The FTSE 100 closed at 4868,
a 0.7% increase from the
last weekend. Despite nega-
tive sentiments over quota
limitations set by OPEC, the
committee of 11 oil-supplying
nations, in its recent meet-

rose.
$1.7bn contract stolen
Last Friday, the US navy
ditched United Technology, a
US-based helicopter manu-
facturing firm, for Lockheed
Martin to build a new presi-
dential helicopter fleet in a
deal valued at over $1.7bn.
Lockheed Martin stole
the deal despite United
Technology serving the presi-
dent since 1957. Lockheed
will build a US-101 helicopter
made by a Somerset-based
firm employing 4,000 people.
Citigroup insurance
Citigroup has pinpointed its
insurance arm as a hinder-
ance rather than a help and
sold it for $11.5bn to MetLife,
now the largest individual
life insurer in America. As a
result of the sale, MetLife’s
retirement and general sav-
ings account has grown by
almost two thirds. The deal
will be financed using a com-
bination of equity and con-
vertible securities, cash, debt
and sales of assets.
Spitzer sues skanks
Elliot Spitzer’s investiga-
tion into the world’s largest
insurance broker, Marsh &
McLennan, has yielded fruit-
ful results as Marsh has
agreed to pay out $850m to
settle charges of conspir-
ing with insurers to rig bids.
Now it will pay a hefty fine to
settle the charges and intro-
duce governance changes
firmwide.
