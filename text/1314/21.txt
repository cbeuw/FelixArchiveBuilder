ALBUM REVIEWS
Groups that can be associated with
the garage rock revolution a couple
of years back either changed their
sound to move away from the spent
medium, such as The Von Bondies,
or changed their name hoping no-
one would notice, like The Beat-Up
(formerly known as The Beatings).
Trust their luck that a U2-loving
band from Las Vegas (The Kills, you
ignorant scum) had to come along,
so now this duo are stuck with plan
A if they’re to stay vital.
The Kills were an exciting pros-
pect when stripped-down rock
was welcome thanks to The White
Stripes and The Black Keys. But
The Stripes beefed up their sound
(Jack overdubbed to a Queen-like
excess and Meg hit the skins a bit
harder) and the Black Keys faded
into anonymity (or glowing Pitchfork
reviews, same difference – Ed). So
come 2003, when I last saw them
live (at Leeds festival), they were
just so tedious to watch, I put it on a
par with an Embrace concert, and I
think said whingers have more sex
and drama in their show (they do
have long hair, DAN-GER-OUS!).
If The Kills don’t want to fade into
obscurity, then they need to roll up
their thrift store sleeves and make
their music essential.
Well, optimistically speaking, they
won’t disappoint fans, if they still
have any fans. It resembles their
debut album in a non-ashamed way,
and they took as long to make this
album as its predecessor. The drum
machines are there still, but they’ve
waned in excitement. Maybe the
pressure of the follow-up got to their
beat-making circuit boards; why is
it that the technology has to suf-
fer? I’m going to start up a fund for
misused machinery in music. It’ll be
called Emineminem (I welcome any
lawsuits). I already have support
from the Strokes’ effects pedals (suf-
fering from neglect).
It is so difficult to talk about this
album. The more I listen to it, the
more laboured it feels. Of all eleven
tracks I only seem to enjoy No Wow,
Love Is A Deserter and Murdermile;
the other tracks I ignore. The title
track has a nice Kraftwerk-esque
feel in the monotony of the kick
drums. It shows that they have dark-
ened their sound and sets the tone
for the album with lyrics like, “you
gonna have to step over my dead
body before you walk out that door.”
It builds steadily and manages to
excite me (commendable). Love Is
A Deserter feels like a progression
in sound incorporating some catchy
new wave guitar licks via the delta
blues. The last of the three decent
tracks is propelled by a wonderful
train-like stomp with the melodic
line: “It’s a train wreck, you got me
on the wrong track honey” sung by
Hotel (guitarist and vocalist).
Aside from those songs we have
a boring, aimless and ideas-starved
album. It’s the musical equivalent of
filling out a tax form: You don’t want
to do it, you can’t see how it benefits
you and you feel like you should’ve
kept the money.

Kevin Mark Trail first came to the
attention of the music world when
he worked with The Streets, lay-
ing down the vocals for tracks such
as Let’s Push Things Forward and
Same Old Thing. Now he’s decided
to step out of the shadow of his good
friend Mike Skinner and make a
name for himself with this, his debut
album.
This collection of songs, all writ-
ten and co-produced by Trail,
tries to bring the listener into the
Wembley raised singer’s world: life
in London, relationships and family.
Stylistically, he manages to incor-
porate aspects of soul, reggae and
drum and bass.
Album opener and next single, D
Thames, sets the tone with drum
and piano loops, providing the back-
drop to Trail’s smooth, soulful voice.
The next track, Perspective, was
released as a single and describes
Trail’s earlier years, growing up in
a single parent family, scribbling
lyrics in school lessons and singing
Boys II Men songs in the backroom
while working. Trail’s reggae influ-
ences are most prominent on this
song, with its laid-back beat accom-
panied by requisite trumpet blasts.
Other highlights include the won-
derfully uplifting Full Moon, with
its strings and gospel choir-style
backing vocals, and the beautiful
Breathless. However, there are one
or two songs where Trail fails quite
badly. Bread is slightly too bouncy
and preachy for its own good, sound-
ing like a government advertise-
ment for happy family living, and Da
Ragga is just a mess of brass instru-
ments and amateur rapping.
The NME described Kevin
as “The UK’s Next Big Thing in
ragga-infused Brit soul,” and other
critics have been similarly full of
praise. Based on this debut he’s not
quite the finished article, but he’s
certainly got more about him than
Lemar or most other current British
soul artists you care to mention.
He has already supported some
big names like Massive Attack,
N*E*R*D and Beverly Knight.
Hopefully he can use those experi-
ences to develop and build from this
solid debut.

Dubbed as a new R&B sensation,
Ciara has already been seen atop
both US and UK charts. Exploiting
a new sub-genre, Goodies blends
established R&B with crunk, lead-
ing to varied results. Not only has
Ciara rallied a host of guest vocal-
ists, including the likes of Ludacris,
R. Kelly and Missy Elliott, but she
has also recruited some big names
behind the mixing desk, namely Lil
Jon and Jazze Pha.
The title track, Goodies, was the
first released single off the album.
It’s a collaboration with the deep
voiced Petey Pablo, featuring
stripped-down backing, thick synth
bass and pseudo sirens over Ciara’s
raunchy whispers. Whipping up
media hype as it rose to the top of
the charts, it is soon to be followed
by 1, 2 Step, another collaboration
(this time with Missy Elliot). 1, 2
Step is similar to Goodies; it’s a mix-
ture of gritty bass, electro splurts
and smooth melodies - a sure fire hit
in and out of the club.
Unfortunately, past these two
tracks the album falls short of expec-
tations with Destiny’s Child-esque
slow ballads failing to impress,
along with the adoption of Sean
Paul’s technique of announcing his
name at the beginning of songs.
Ciara tries hard, exploring a vari-
ety of vocal styles and demonstrat-
ing her undeniable talent. Goodies
almost collapses in its attempt to
be original; the repetitive electro
sound effects become annoying by
the third track and accumulate in a
Super Mario-style ditty supporting
R. Kelly’s appearance producing on
Next To You.
Beyond the obsession with phone
calls (reminiscent of Blazing Squad’s
Love On The Line), Ciara delivers
upbeat, chill-out R&B with a new
twist. Packed with big names from
the industry, Goodies has a fresh
sound, with catchy lyrics and some
hot tracks (notably Oh, featuring
Ludacris, and Lookin’ At You). A
female Usher she isn’t, but this is
only the first album.
