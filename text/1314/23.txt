CLUB REVIEW
Straight away I feel should say I am
not usually a hardcore hard house
fan, which is obvious just from look-
ing at me. I like my house, funky
or dirty. I am a hard house virgin
as far as clubbing goes, and I do
not take kindly to pilled up cyber
kids screaming at me “Yeah, fucking
yeah, this is... yeah!”
And that’s on the bus on the way
there. They really need to calm
down, I think it’s all that nylon in
their fluffy boots. So, as you can
imagine, I was dreading it just a bit,
but my boyfriend was well up for
it, so I had to at least pretend to be
interested.
I’ve been to Turnmills before for
City Loud, and as far as venues go
it’s alright, but nowhere near the
league of Pacha or Café de Paris.
The music played doesn’t lend itself
to a bit of class and clean carpets.
Turnmills is like someone took
Fabric, gave it a bath and sent it
to school to learn how to work in
McDonalds (as opposed to robbing
cars). You go there expecting a bit
of dirt, all in a good way. Extreme
Euphoria is a very appropriate
night to be held there – generally
hard house fans aren’t usually too
worried about the cleanliness of a
venue; they prefer the dark places
as they hide all their pill taking.
Now the few of you out there that
don’t do pills, don’t worry, I’m not
referring to you. Chavs generally
tend to go straight for the alcopops.
I’m joking, of course – not everyone
who goes to hard house nights is
a chav or a pillhead. In fact, I got
asked about my abilities to supply
far less at Turnmills than I did when
I went to Asda in Clapham at 2am.
Back in Turnmills, the mix of peo-
ple was quite surprising. You had
everything from your staple diet of
cybers, thrash-heads and the ran-
dom middle aged men who just
appear at these events. Everyone
was really friendly and loved up.
Wink-wink, nudge-nudge, need I say
more?
When I was chatting to this girl in
the queue, I was a bit surprised to
find out that she was studying for
her bar exams and this other cou-
ple had kids and lived in Chiswick.
It takes all sorts I guess, which is
really what clubbing is all about – to
get beyond all that bullshit of pigeon
holing.
The guy to girl ratio did start to
resemble an Imperial outing until
I found the back room, the funky
room. This is one thing that tends
not to change no matter where
you go – generally girls (I do mean
very generally) tend to prefer the
funky room as it is far less mad and
sweaty, so their make-up doesn’t
run. Overall the night was about
60% men, which isn’t too bad, and
the girls who were properly danc-
ing their tits off in the main room
to Anne Savage were a right laugh.
One girl even dared me to moon the
DJ booth. I mean, I was tempted
until she just decided I was taking
too long and did it herself. Security
arrived and told her to calm down.
Drinks in Turnmills are expensive
– you’re looking to pay about £2.50
for a bottle of water or a coke and
about £4.50 for a beer. If you’re going
out in London to one of the big clubs
you expect to pay a lot, so I wasn’t
too surprised. The bar staff aren’t
the friendliest of people either at
Turnmills, but I think it’s due to
the fact that everyone kept hassling
them for free glasses of water. Why
clubs don’t just hand them out freely
I don’t know, and what’s even worse
is that some bar staff will give it to
you but some are very strict.
The high cost of drinks didn’t seem
to stop people having a good time,
and the bar was packed three deep
most of the night. Turnmills is most
certainly very popular on Saturday,
which is probably due to the success
of the Extreme Euphoria CD range
from Anne Savage.
I had a lot of negative expectations
as you must have guessed by now
about the whole night – it was eve-
rything I thought I didn’t like about
clubbing. I really had a good time, so
for those who fancy something a bit
hardcore, give it a go.
Getting back home is a bit of an
arse though, so the euphoria may
wear off when you’re stood at a bus
stop with one of the few pilled up
chavs who got in telling you how
great the night was and how they’ve
met Anne Savage, blah blah blah...
Alright, I get it, I was there, I don’t
need to be told over and over and
over again. Go do yourself a favour
and steal a car.

Cyber kids, thrashers and middle aged men. These are the kind of people you find at a
night like Extreme Euphoria. Oh, and Felix reviewers too...

CLUB REVIEW
A short review about a short visit.
I don’t recommend going out when
you are ill – you make some of
the worst decisions. Such an
event happened to me on Sunday
night.
My friend Mike and I decided we
should try new and exciting pas-
tures. This idea led us to 333 in Old
Street, we think.
This is where some of the prob-
lems occur. We aren’t too sure
where we went as there were two
entrances next to each other, but we
think we went into 333. So, bearing
this in mind if you do want to go to
333, make sure you check which
entrance it is.
A quick rundown of the place:
drinks were expensive consider-
ing there was no proper flooring in
the place, and the basement room
actually had whole chunks of the
floor missing. It was an interest-
ing experience, to say the least; I
saw where heroin addicts go out
and have sex in the toilets. Oh yes.
I also saw one of the worst drag
queens ever; she didn’t even bother
to shave. I think this may well have
a been a ‘look’ but when combined
with an eighties red leather skirt-
suit I don’t think ‘look’ quite covers
it. I think ‘frightening’ is a better
word.
The whole night was quite a laugh.
I think it was more to do with the
fact that Mike had decided to buy a
little bottle of absinthe and drink it
at a bus stop, but a fun night is still
a fun night.
I wouldn’t recommend Monster
but I have heard high reviews of
other nights at 333. It’s worth mis-
sioning over to east London just for
something different.

EDITORIAL
You may have noticed that, for a
change, this page is not covered in
ramblings from me about the clubs
I like. Finally, some of you out there
are getting some free clubbing in
return for a few words about the
night you’ve had. For those who
don’t know, here’s the deal:
Clubs in London are all vying for
your student buck, and they all like
publicity. Felix reviewers get on
the guestlist (plus a mate), and in
return the club gets some column-
inches, be they praise, disgust or
bewilderment.
You might think the places we
review aren’t your cup of tea. Fair
enough, but then what is? You all
like to go out, and we want to tell
everyone about it.
I use the word club in a general
sense – there’s a smorgasbord of
venues to choose from in London,
offering all kinds of night time enter-
tainment. I may personally prefer
the dance music and DJ oriented
clubs, but I want to hear about any-
where you go.
So if you want to save some cash
on your nights out and tell everyone
which hotspots are hot or not, drop
me a line on clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk.
