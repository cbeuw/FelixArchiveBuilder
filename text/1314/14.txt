If video games are your thing,
have you ever thought of
making a career out of them?
Sophia Smith is an Imperial
graduate who now works as a
games developer. She tells us
about her experiences.
What did you do after
you left Imperial?
“I took a year out to earn
some money and decide what
I wanted to do. I soon decided
that I wanted to get a Masters
degree, so the following year
I took an MSc in Intelligent
Systems at Brunel University.
After that, I started a full-time
job.”
How did you get into de-
veloping video games?
Did you have any jobs in
between?
“My first job was as a C
programmer at Citibank in
Hammersmith. This was
a contract position which,
although lucrative, wouldn’t
have taken me anywhere
in terms of career progres-
sion. After 18 months I got
a graduate job with EDS in
their defence division where
I worked for over four years.
This was really interesting
work, and I got on to var-
ied projects and learned a
lot. Eventually, there came a
time when I felt the need to
move on and only then did it
occur to me to combine my
passion for video games with
my skills as a programmer!
I managed to get into ECTS
in Earls Court that year and
check out the company that
made my favourite games
(BioWare). They seemed like
a really nice bunch of people,
so I sent them my CV and it
progressed from there!”
Do you think being at
Imperial has equipped
you well for your future?
“I do. I got a good grounding
in the subjects that I needed
for my Masters degree and
also took the opportunity to
learn some Japanese along
the way, which has been
useful to me. Also, coming
from a girls’ school, it was a
big change for me purely in
terms of gender ratio – a ratio
that has persisted throughout
my working life.”
Can you give us more
detailed information on
what your work involves
and the projects you
have worked on?
“I am on a game engine pro-
gramming team. This means
that we deal with game rules
and objects. For instance, the
first thing I worked on was
the Encounter System, which
detects when the player has
entered a specific area and
spawns one or more monsters
of a level appropriate for the
player to fight. The monsters
are either a short distance
away, so that the player even-
tually comes across them,
or hidden around a corner
so that they can ambush the
player. I also collaborated
with game designers to work
on the scripting system that
controls the behaviour of the
monsters in the game.
Last year, I did some
work on the graphical user
interface, and I’m currently
implementing combat rules.
I’ve worked on Neverwinter
Nights, Star Wars: Knights of
the Old Republic and a tiny
bit on Jade Empire, which is
coming out soon. I’m current-
ly on a project called Dragon
Age, which is a roleplaying
game in a fantasy setting.”
Do you have any advice
for students wishing to
get into this field or
advice resulting from
your experiences?
“You have to be passionate
about games to work in this
industry, and you have to be
able to analyse why you like
a game, what frustrates you
about it, and how you would
do it better. It always helps to
have a knockout demo accom-
panying your application.”
What can you tell us
about the games
industry and the
opportunities there
are within it?
“It’s a really fun industry
to be in. Creating a game
requires a team possessing a
very wide range of skills: art-
ists, writers, rules designers,
animators, programmers,
sound engineers... there’s
something for everyone!”

GABRIELLA SILVESTRI &
CASSANDRA ALDRICH
CAREERS EDITORS
By Gabriella Silvestri
and Cassandra Aldrich
As a physics student you may
never have thought of the
NHS as a future employer,
but, as Imperial graduate and
medical physicist Rebecca
Day explains, the profession
may be worth a look.
Did you always want to
go into medical
research?
“The job I do is not primarily
medical research, although it
does involve some research. I
didn’t always want to go into
this job. I only decided on this
career in my final year when
I found out about the excel-
lent medical physics training
scheme.”
What did you do after
you left Imperial? Did
you go straight into the
NHS?
“Yes, after a summer of trav-
elling I went straight into my
job in Edinburgh. In order to
qualify for the grade A trainee
scheme you need a degree in
physics or engineering. They
do not necessarily require a
first; a 2:1 is fine. They are
looking for people who are
enthusiastic and will be able
to work with a whole host
of different people, including
patients, medics and techni-
cians. I got some experience
first by shadowing a medical
physicist at the Charing Cross
hospital for two days. There
is tough competition for the
grade A training posts, so
some medical physics experi-
ence (even just two days) will
stand you in good stead.”
Do you think being at
Imperial has equipped
you well for your future?
“Yes. Degrees from Imperial
are well respected by employ-
ers. Employers want to be
sure that trainees have a
good grounding in the basics
of physics before they give
you more specialist training.”
Can you give us more
detailed info on what
your day to day work
involves and the
projects you work on?
“I am currently doing a train-
ing placement in the radio-
therapy department at the
Western General Hospital
in Edinburgh. This week I
have completed the following:
Monday morning: CT scanner
fortnightly quality assurance
testing. Monday afternoon:
As part of my training place-
ment, I assisted with the CT
scanning of patients in prepa-
ration for their radiotherapy
treatments. Tuesday: This is
my MSc day. I commute to
Glasgow where I have MSc
lectures. Wednesday morn-
ing: Planning of radiother-
apy treatments for patients
with head and neck can-
cer. Wednesday Afternoon:
Placement in the mould room
where moulds are taken of
patients heads so that masks
can be made for their treat-
ments. Thursday morn-
ing: Head and neck treat-
ment planning. Thursday
afternoon: As part of my
training I went to observe
the radiotherapy treatments
of patients with lung cancer.
Friday: More quality assur-
ance testing on one of the
x-ray units plus some experi-
ments concerned with patient
doses.”
Can you tell us more
about the training
scheme that the NHS
runs for physics
graduates?
“For the first two years,
trainees study part-time for
an MSc in clinical physics,
and they will complete three
placements in different medi-
cal physics departments.
(For example I will be doing
radiotherapy, diagnostic x-ray
and nuclear medicine). The
training scheme is known
as the ‘Grade A Training
Scheme,’ and there are about
80 training places in hospitals
throughout the UK. Trainees
receive a salary and MSc
fees are paid on their behalf.
After the initial two years,
on successful completetion of
exams, trainees progress to
grade B jobs and hopefully
obtain state registration after
another two years.
Medical physics is con-
cerned with the application
and development of the prin-
ciples and techniques of phys-
ics to the diagnosis, treatment
and prevention of human
disease. Medical physicists
have very diverse roles that
can include comissioning new
medical equipment, routine
quality assurance of equip-
ment or the development of
new treatment and diagnosis
techniques. There is a huge
shortage of medical physi-
cists meaning that a trained
medical physicist will never
be out of work! You can find
out more at www.ipem.ac.uk
or at www.nhsclinicalscien-
tists.info.”
Do you have any advice
for students who want
a career in research or
advice resulting from
your experiences?
“Make sure you get some
hands on experience in a hos-
pital before you apply. Just
ring up a medical physics
department and ask them
for a couple of days experi-
ence.
Take copies of your final
year project report along to
the interview (even if they
don’t request a copy), and
make sure you give all the
interviewers a copy; it will
impress them. Do lots of
research on the subject area
you are applying for.”
