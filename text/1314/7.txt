Leaflet litter
Dear all,
I would like to make an appeal to
Club and Society Event Officers
and students alike concerning the
increasing problem of ‘leafleting’
and the damage it does to the envi-
ronment and our college premises.
Walking along the walkway this
week I have being abhorred to see
so much litter besmirching it; much
of this litter is club and society relat-
ed, usually pamphlets advertising
events etc, yet for the most part
all they seem to do is litter the
floor. Can I ask all clubs and socie-
ties to think more carefully about
their advertising methods – blanket-
ing the walkway with posters and
thrusting leaflets into uninviting
hands does not get more people
to come to your events, indeed the
irritation caused is likely to have the
reverse affect.
Smaller, more personal, focused
campaigns have a much greater
success rate. Perhaps a table on the
walkway, in the JCR or the Union
entrance with relevant posters
around it, a few information leaf-
lets and some friendly people using
there skills of perception to target
likely individuals would have much
more success. Not all clubs and
societies are to blame I have seen
some using these ‘more focused’
techniques with great success.
Again for general campus wide
advertising perhaps approaching
Felix (or any of the other smaller
campus and department newslet-
ters) with an interesting article
about something you have done
would be a more suitable technique
or approaching specific departmen-
tal societies or even other clubs,
which you think maybe interested
– and obviously at our college do not
forget the power of the website!
If this situation is not curtailed, I
call for fellow students to campaign
to the union to enforce rules on its
clubs and societies about litter crea-
tion, those clubs found to be print-
ing leaflets and due to over-force-
ful advertising causing the littering
of our building should be punished
– perhaps by fining them or reduc-
ing the part of their budget relating
to printing which is clearly not being
used effectively.
Finally it is also not only clubs and
societies to blame but students as
well, upon being given these leaflets
many of us just drop them without
a care, can you please drop them in
the next bin instead, even if you’re
not interested – there are sever-
al bins on the walkway and in the
Union, this is about the easiest way
to do your bit for the environment
and to make college a more aesthet-
ically pleasing place to study.
Thank you

‘Atheism’ posters
Dear Editor,
In response to the letter sent to
Felix (published in issue 1313 on
27th January) on the Atheism post-
ers, I would like to give my response
as a Christian and also as a scien-
tist/engineer on the campus.
As the author of that letter has
noted, this is primarily a science
college. To this end I believe that we
possess the ability to have discus-
sions and debates about any subject,
regardless of how sensitive, in a
calm and rationale manner.
While it is unfortunate that the
‘Life’ poster and flyers had an asser-
tive statement on them as opposed
to a question for debate, it still raises
a valid point for debate and discus-
sion. There are two mutually exclu-
sive views here: the Christians who
put up the poster, along with me,
who believe that Atheism cannot
deliver, and the atheists who would
certainly believe that Christianity
cannot deliver.
We could all sit in our respective
camps and keep issuing insults and
derogatory statements about each
other, but I’m sure a dialogue would
be far more beneficial for all. To that
end, I believe the course that the
Christian Union is makes an excel-
lent forum for such discussions as it
is meant to allow a no holds barred
discussion.
Also, I would also like to raise
the question of why religion makes
this college look farcical? There are
many scientists out there who are
Christians, and many more who
believe in the existence of ‘a god’.
I have, to date, seen no proof that
atheists make better scientists than
Christians or any other person who
believes in the existence of ‘a god’.

To publish or not to publish?
Dear Editor,
I was delighted to read in your reply
to the letter ‘Fun in Felix’ two weeks
ago that anyone is welcome to write
for Felix and that the lack of funny
articles appearing at present was
due to all the comedy writers hav-
ing stopped writing. This came as
a great relief to me because I had
gained the impression that you had
simply stopped publishing some
writers’ work. A little bird told me
that recently you refused to publish
any more articles from a Mr Rupert
Neate, a name that will not be that
familiar to your readers as he has
only written one article for Felix so
far, however that was the front page
article about the knifing in Chelsea.
Your reason for refusing him a regu-
lar, humorous column (I have read
the first one he did and it was very
funny) about student life was, appar-
ently, that you learnt that he was
intending to run for Felix editor. You,
I believe, claimed that it would be
unfair to other candidates to allow
him a column so that he could publi-
cise himself before the elections.
Mr Neate, feeling hard done by
(justifiably so in my opinion), went
to the returning officer, a certain Mr
Arif, to ask about this situation. Mr
Arif informed him that though he
could have a very good case to take
to the elections committee ultimate-
ly you could still simply say that you
would not put his articles in as they
were not good enough.
In fact Mr Neate did have an article
which would have fitted nicely into
yourbusiness/politics/sciencepaper,
it was an interview with the Liberal
Democrat candidate for Kensington
& Chelsea in which she discussed
her defection from the Tory party
and her views on students and the
demolition of Southside but appar-
ently you rejected this as it wasn’t
relevant till the elections, and there
was I thinking that politics went on
all year round, silly, silly me!
If any of the facts I have stated in
this letter are wrong please feel free
to correct me in a nice long answer
on the Felix letters page. Now I
must stop because there is a fas-
cinating article about construction
projects on page 12 of Felix that I
simply must read, oh wait a minute,
actually it’s not that interesting!
Yours Sincerely
Iain Heaton
3rd year Biologist
Dave Edwards, Editor, replies:
I am pleased to take this oppor-
tunity to explain my position and
correct many of the so-called ‘facts’
in the above letter.
Firstly, I am addressing the “lack
of funny articles” this week by pub-
lishing two new columns on page
8.
As for Mr Neate, he told me that
he was standing for Felix Editor,
and then asked for a regular col-
umn. Because the elections had just
opened, and Mr Neate had only
ever written one piece for Felix, I
interpreted this as blatant election-
eering and refused his request.
It would be impossible to allow
candidates to have regular columns
at this stage – they could all ask for
one in order to raise their profile,
even if they did not specifically
mention elections. Also, it would be
very unfair to give the impression
that someone is a regular contribu-
tor to Felix when in fact they are
not. I have discussed this with two
former Felix Editors, both of whom
completely agree with my decision.
The Returning Officer, Mustafa
Arif, said on reading the above let-
ter: “I never told him [Mr Neate] he
would have a good case. I said he
could take it to Elections Committee
if he wanted, but my opinion was
that he would not have enough evi-
dence.”
The Editor of Felix is totally
responsible for all content and has
the right to rule out any submission.
However, I have never “refused to
publish any more articles” from
anyone. I have told Mr Neate that
he is welcome to contribute in sev-
eral different ways. In fact, he has
written an article on page 26 of
this week’s issue. He is welcome to
write a regular column as soon as
the election is over, if he so wishes.
I very much look forward to read-
ing Mr Neate’s interview with the
Liberal Democrat candidate for
Kensington and Chelsea, which
will of course be printed in Felix if
I receive it.
Mr Neate offered me “interviews
with prospective parliamentary
candidates”. Of course politics goes
on all year round, but it is a ques-
tion of when the issues are most
relevant to our readers. I believe
the interviews will be at their most
useful and interesting when the
general election is at the forefront
of people’s minds and when our
readers are making their final deci-
sions on who to vote for. I hope that
the interviews will form an integral
and interesting part of our general
election coverage in late April and
early May.
Finally, I sincerely hope that Mr
Heaton enjoyed last week’s article
on construction projects. Sadly, we
have no plans to print any similar
articles in the near future.
● The full list of candidates
for Felix Editor in the forth-
coming election is as follows:
Simon Clark, Rupert Neate,
Darius Nikbin, Martin Smith

Sir Richard and the environment
What does the Rector really think about green issues at Imperial, asks Joseph Bull
A number of articles have appeared
in Felix devoted to an issue that is
presently at the forefront of world
politics: the issue of environmental
concern. I would also like to reveal
that a number of students have been
carrying out a small and simple
survey this year, asking Imperial
students and staff whether or not
they agree that the College should
reduce its environmental impact
and implement an environmen-
tal management system. Almost
without exception, they do. What,
then, does our venerable Rector,
Imperial’s figurehead, have to say
on the matter?
Last Thursday, there was an
opportunity to find out, as the
Rector held his annual open ‘face
to face’. During his initial presenta-
tion, Sir Richard mentioned the pos-
sibility of an amalgamation of all of
Imperial’s strands of environmental
research and the possibility of a
heavier emphasis on this particular
subject. Consequently, he was asked
what environmental policies and ini-
tiatives accompanied this research
and how they applied to the running
of Imperial. More specifically, had
any environmental measures come
to fruition?
Long and genial answers were
duly supplied; however, not a single
specific example was given, at odds
with the request. This is the Rector
when he speaks publicly to students.
He is friendly and calm, sharp and
intelligent; however, his answers
can be exceptionally indirect and
even avoid the thrust of the question
completely. He is the quintessential
politician.
Later on, following similar ques-
tioning, he finally gave an exam-
ple of a way in which Imperial has
attempted to improve its environ-
mental image and culture: through
a series of lectures on green topics
that were run recently in conjunc-
tion with LSE.
Now first of all, this seems an
odd choice of a shining example of
Imperial’s commitment to the envi-
ronment (what other groundbreak-
ing initiatives have we spearheaded,
you may well ask?) But, more impor-
tantly, it is interesting to note that
upon further investigation, it seems
the College had little to do with the
organisation of these lectures, rath-
er, they were chiefly orchestrated by
the humble student Environmental
Society! If I am wrong, I apologise
in advance, but the only evidence of
lectures like these was to be found
on the ESoc website. Now either
the Rector was unaware of this, and
thus perhaps unaware of, and dis-
interested in, the college’s environ-
mental actions in general, or he was
trying to mislead and appease the
environmentalists who were asking
the questions. It was thus only natu-
ral that it was asked, directly, what
it is he personally feels about these
environmental concerns: “I think
they are very important.” That, at
least, is encouraging to know.
The environment is something a
number of students and staff have
demonstrated feeling over, and
the College is responding. Those
in attendance were assured that
an energy policy is forthcoming in
February and an environmental
policy by the end of the year. This,
incidentally, will bring us up to the
level of other top universities (we
appear to be the only one in the
top ten without either policy), and I
have to agree with the Rector that,
in general, “...we cannot allow our-
selves to be outflanked by Oxford
and Cambridge.”
Imperial College has also just
had a ‘preliminary environmental
review’, which has clearly laid out
areas of substantial environmental
impact and made recommendations
for improvement.
To conclude, while the College is
still at present known for its lack of
environmental concern, and there is
much that could be done, action is
promised in the near future. As for
our Rector, he is genial enough and
no fool, and he apparently considers
the environment (and student wel-
fare in general) important, but still
seems to cloak his true feelings and
intentions in rhetoric, giving stu-
dents little chance to know, under-
stand, or, crucially, trust him.
