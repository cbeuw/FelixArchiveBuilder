Hey, how are you? We hope you’re all okay. Coffee Break has a celebrity guest this week, Mr Roy
Walker himself. He’s hosting our hilariously titled ‘Cat-phrase’. He wasn’t too happy about it though.
Something about ‘toilet humour’. As always, send your answers to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk

Cat-phrase
“Hello there! I’m Roy Walker!
Work’s dried up a bit since I ‘left’
Catchphrase by ‘mutual agreement’.
When I say left, I mean fired, and
when I say by mutual agreement, I
mean by some fat old cow who doesn’t
know the first thing about quality
gameshows.
But I’m not bitter, I’ve found new
work.
I’ve been on the radio a bit recently,
but my first love has always been
Catchphrase. So naturally I was
delighted when the Coffee Break guys
asked me to host their own version in
this here newspaper. What they didn’t tell me, however, was that
they have no budget or talent whatsoever, and have had to use
shitty drawings of cats, instead of the high-tech animations of Mr
Chips that I’m used to. But I’ll give it a go anyway.
On the right are six drawings, representing six catchphrases.
All you have to do is say what you see and tell us what they mean.
There’s two points for each one you get right, and what do points
mean? Prizes! It’s nothing decent like a speedboat or fondue set
mind, but at the end of the year, there will be stuff given away.
You know, they’re not paying me for this, I’m doing it as favour
to my old pal Dickie Sykes. If you’re reading Dickie, give me a
ring. It’d be great to hear from you. I’m a bit short on cash too, you
couldn’t spare a little could you? Good luck readers!”
