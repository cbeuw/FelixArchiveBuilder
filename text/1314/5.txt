For the past two hundred
years, the opportunity to view
human corpses and their
inner workings has been
confined to the circles of the
medical elite. That is, until
Dr Gunther von Hagens came
along.
Von Hagens, the pathologist
at the heart of the Anatomy
for Beginners TV series aired
last week, is a man on a mis-
sion. His goal is to reveal, in
minute and gory detail, the
art of human dissection, and,
in so doing, to share with the
general public what he calls
the “poetry of anatomy.”
The study of human anato-
my is by no means a modern
invention. As early as 275BC,
anatomy was being taught
by Herophilus in Alexandria,
Egypt through the use of
humandissections.Bythesec-
ond century AD, the Greeks
had produced a number of
anatomical works which were
translated into Arabic and
later into Latin. In 1235, the
first European medical school
was founded at Salerno, Italy
where bodies were publicly
dissected. In 1510 Leonardo
da Vinci turned his hand to
the study of anatomy and, in
1543, Andreas Vesalius, argu-
ably the pioneer of modern
anatomy, created the first pre-
cise anatomical drawings.
By the 16th century, ana-
tomical theatres were crop-
ping up all over Europe and
public autopsies were com-
monplace. From 1600 to 1900
anatomy played an increas-
ingly important role in medi-
cal education and research.
But with the establishment
of medical schools, human
corpses slowly drifted out of
public sight. A new taboo had
emerged.
In 1977, von Hagens invent-
ed a mummification technique
known as ‘plastination’ which
paved the way for break-
ing that taboo. This process
replaces bodily fluids and fat
with synthetic polymers which
solidify and preserve tis-
sue down to the microscopic
level. At first sight, the bodies
look like anatomical models.
Muscles, organs, the nervous
system,and blood vessels are
all frozen in time. Plastinated
body parts have proved to be
invaluable in cross-sectional
anatomy, pathology and scien-
tific research and can be used
in conjunction with conven-
tional imaging methods.
Clever science it may be,
but is Anatomy for Beginners
taking it too far? Before tun-
ing in, I was very sceptical;
I imagined von Hagens to
be some sort of modern-day
Frankenstein, a macabre
showman vying for the atten-
tion of the masses. The man
behind the ‘Body Worlds’
exhibitions, von Hagens is
no stranger to controversy.
His work has been described
by some as “ghoulish and
degrading” and has sparked
fierce ethical debate world-
wide.
But what I saw was a series
of well-presented, thought-
provoking public lectures that
make for great scientific edu-
cation. Dr von Hagens and
fellow-pathologist, Professor
John Lee, take us on a fas-
cinating tour of the human
body, making use of live, dead
and plastinated models. The
series was filmed in front of
a studio audience of medical
students and body donors and
follows four themes: move-
ment, circulation, digestion
and reproduction. Cadavers’
faces were covered in order
to preserve anonymity. While
von Hagens displays his dis-
secting skills with fervour,
Lee does a marvellous job
of describing the part of the
body we are seeing and how
it works.
Admittedly, it was at times
stomach-churning stuff.
When von Hagens removes
a man’s entire skin in one
piece, we are simultaneously
impressed and repulsed. The
penis dissection and skull-
chiselling make for pretty
uncomfortable viewing. At
one point, von Hagens dem-
onstrates the consistency of
the brain by dropping a blanc-
mange from a great height. In
another lecture he stretches
seven metres of someone’s
gut across the studio.
One could argue that such
spectacles are dehumanising
and degrading, but I would
have to disagree. In a cul-
ture that televises plastic sur-
gery for our entertainment,
Anatomy for Beginners
provides a fresh insight into
the fascinating world of the
human body. I found myself
amazed by many of the sights
I saw.
Yes, Dr von Hagens is a per-
former who cuts up corpses
with relish, but, in his own
words, he “breaks with the
tradition of Frankenstein.”
Von Hagens emerges as an
artist and educator, who takes
pride in his work and whose
goal is to share the wonder of
human anatomy with profes-
sionals and laypeople alike.
Programmes like this allow us
to marvel at the diversity and
beauty of human nature. It’s
an opportunity to think about
our attitudes towards health,
life and death. In von Hagens’
own words, it’s a chance to
see our “face within.”

Gunther von Hagens: dissected a human corpse for television and a live studio audience
It’s what’s inside that counts
Anatomy for Beginners shocked and amazed viewers, with some describing it as ‘dehumanising’
and others ‘fascinating’. Amber Jenkins reports on its place in the history of anatomy

Events: Evolution Week at the Darwin Centre
The Darwin Centre is located
next to the Natural History
Museum on Queens Gate.
From this Saturday, they
will be hosting a series of free
events to mark Evolution
Week.
Saturday 5 February
12:00 and 14:30
What is evolution?
An exploration of the theory
of evolution by natural selec-
tion.
Sunday 6 February
12:00 and 14:30
Are we still evolving?
With medical developments
from in-vitro fertilisation to
long-term care, and a social
jungle different from our
ancestral habitat, have we
moved beyond evolution?
Monday 7 February
14:30
Darwin’s pigeons
Looking at the real role of
Darwin’s finches in his evolu-
tionary work.
Tuesday 8 February
14:30
Evolution in the Virtual World
How computer simulations of
natural selection are helping
scientists and designer rec-
reate living organisms and
what they may be able to tell
us about how life began.
Wednesday 8 February
14:30
Designer dogs
Darwin may never have dis-
covered natural selection
without an example of artifi-
cial selection.
Thursday 10 February

lution in action?
Friday 11 February

three foot primate is one of
the most surprising develop-
ments in our study of our
species. Discover what the

Pokemon causes cancer
Can you believe it?
Apparently, and this is a fact,
a gene associated with watch-
ing Pokemon causes cancer.
Forget passive smoking, it’s
Pikachu you should be worried
about.
Shock
My kids, Reggie and Regina,
(aged 34, 41 respectively) are
avid fans of Pokemon, but
this is the last time I’ll expose
them to the carcinogenic
nightmare.
New Synthetic Enzyme
Researchers report this week
that they have created a syn-
thetic catalyst that works the
same way as enzymes do.
This is a new fact.
It shows that a synthetic
catalyst can be made like
enzymes.
A discovery that will have
massive implications in the
science of enzymes.
Great! I don’t know what that
means but I’m lovin’ it.
New shocking evidence on
Global Warming
I am as skeptical as a Sunni
voting in the Iraqi elections
about global warming.
So much so that I conduct-
ed an experiment to find out
whether global warming is
actually happening or not.
By placing a thermometer
in my garden for a month the
temperature of the earth was
measured (by me).
The results showed a signifi-
cant rise in temperature of 4
centrigrade.
Significant
Amazingly, if the tempera-
tures carry on like this, by
2015, Camden is going to be
hotter than the Earth’s core.
However, by averagising
with data from a colleague in
Australia - it was found (by
me) that the global tempera-
ture rise will be sweet FA.
So there you have it: global
warming is poppycock.
