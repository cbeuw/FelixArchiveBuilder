The theatre has never shied away
from showcasing some of the worst
and most disturbing facets of human
nature. Some plays will be comical,
while others will be of a somewhat
less cheery disposition. While The
Anniversary definitely falls into the
first category, Festen most certainly
does not.
Currently showing at the Lyric
Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue,
Festen is an interesting piece of
theatre. The play is an adaptation
of the recent Danish movie of the
same name and tackles some real-
ly very unpleasant subject matter.
Not being particularly well versed
in Danish cinema (though I did see
a rather funny Danish movie this
summer, but I can’t remember its
name at all), I can’t really say how
well the adaptation has been car-
ried out. However, from the general
description of the movie that I got
from a friend, the play did seem to
capture the feel of the film appro-
priately.
The script was well acted out by
the cast, and the staging worked
well. The story focuses on some
rather disturbing revelations made
at a birthday party, hence the title
Festen. We are at the 60th birthday
celebrations of a respected gentle-
man, successful businessman and
loving father, when his youngest
son begins to toast to his father’s
health with some very unsettling
stories. What ensues is a harrowing
evening for the family as they try to
silence the ‘crazy’ son and become
increasingly inebriated. Eventually
the truth is revealed by a posthu-
mous letter.
While the subject matter may not
be the most savoury in nature, the
play is certainly enjoyable, not some-
thing that I could say about another
play with similarly disturbing cen-
tral theme, The Goat. Fortunately
The Goat has now moved on, and
Festen will continue to run until the
start of April.
On an unrelated note, a new
exhibition has opened at the Royal
Academy. Turks has received rave
reviews from the national press, and
I hope also from myself as soon I get
round to seeing it. The exhibition is
housed in the Academy’s main gal-
leries and is accompanied by what
sound like a good selection of lec-
tures, courses and ancillary exhib-
its. Late opening has been extended
now to encompass Saturday eve-
nings too, and a selection of mezze
are available to enhance the Turkish
experience at the restaurant. And if
you are feeling like you really want
to get into the whole Turkish thing,
the Royal Academy have made an
arrangement with Sofra restaurants
to offer a discount on a meal with an
exhibition ticket.
To find out more details about
this exhibition and the associated
events, go to the Royal Academy’s
website www.royalacademy.org.uk.
From this site you can follow a link
to the special Turks website and get
a sneak preview of the exhibition.
Tickets are £8 for students, and yes,
that is a lot, but it’s a lot cheaper
than going to Turkey.
Having been ‘encouraged’ to attend
by various friends and Felix con-
tributors, I took my seat in an audi-
ence of around 100 for Dramsoc’s
first ever pantomime. On the basis
of the confident acting, the frequent
audience laughter and some superb
comedy performances, I’m sure it
won’t be their last.
You can’t have a pantomime with-
out a dame, and Siegfried Hodgson
gave a wonderfully funny perform-
ance as Widow English, Jack’s
mother. Towering above the rest of
the cast, the Widow (of course) sent
Jack away to sell a cow.
Jack, confidently played with
much thigh-slapping by Charlotte
Coales, returned with the obligato-
ry magic beans, climbed the bean-
stalk and returned with more than
enough gold to pay the rent. But
that’s where the similarity with the
‘traditional’ storyline ended.
This production introduced a sur-
prisingly normal-sized couple of
giants to the mix, together with
their guards, a dysfunctional royal
family and a completely useless
servant called Stammers.
The prerequisite panto baddie,
Witch Whey (Brooke Milburn), was
joined in most scenes by an unu-
sual addition – the rapping Wizard
Wheeze (Iain Heaton), whose comi-
cal delivery went down well with
the audience.
For me, the real highlights were
two unscripted moments in the sec-
ond half. Firstly, a pyrotechnic at
the front of the stage exploded and
then failed to extinguish itself, so
Simon (Jack’s sister’s boyfriend,
played by Richard Jordan) walked
over and calmly blew it out. Then,
just after a set change, a cloud
magically appeared at the bottom of
the beanstalk. “That’s a funny place
for a cloud,” said Simon, before
throwing it (and a wayward bomb)
off the stage.
The inclusion of a song near the
end of the show, though traditional,
was probably a mistake. But this
was a pantomime and fun was the
aim, so any other shortcomings
didn’t really matter.
It’s always good to see Imperial
students show off their more ‘arty’
talents. Going by this production,
Dramsoc’s next pantomime comes
highly recommended.

In the school of journalism they
stress it is important not to start
an article with an obvious token
of common knowledge. Forgive me,
for I am to break this rule briefly
to state that theatre is different for
everyone. Everyone goes to the the-
atre to see and feel different sights
and emotions. Passive and active
audience members alike can rest
assured that The Anniversary at
the Garrick Theatre has something
for you.
The Anniversary, set in the 1960s
in South London, refers to the wed-
ding anniversary of Mum and her
late husband. The family is together
to celebrate and disintegrate, for
Mum is a destructive trickster who
gets off at each horrifying stunt she
inflicts on her children and in-laws.
Sheila Hancock, who plays Mum
in this production that runs like one
long mother-in-law joke, is delight-
ful. She plays the audience like a
fiddle, and her long-standing experi-
ence wafts into the audience.
Madeline Worrall, playing Shirley,
Tom’s new girlfriend, performs like
nails on a chalkboard. Her character
is annoying and her wig is dreadful.
I wanted terribly to feel sorry for
her and like her, but it was impos-
sible. She is a dramatic actor, not a
comedy actor.
My favorite female was Rosie
Cavaliero, playing Karen the daugh-
ter-in-law. She embodied what it
feels like to be an in-law and how
frustrating and comical it can be.
She gave the play life and character,
and brought it home to those of us
who have experienced being the odd
one out in a family full of nutters.
The gentlemen in the produc-
tion were fantastic. Each of them
in their place, they made the play
fun to watch and had a great stage
presence. My favorite was Liam
Garrington, who played Tom,
Shirley’s fiancé. He made an effort
to connect with the audience and
had a special relationship with each
character on the stage. I wanted to
take him and his cute sixties cloth-
ing home with me.
The set design, by Robin Don,
must not go without mention. The
set is very functional and the room
they are in is without a doubt a
user-friendly sitting room. Lights
and sound were spot on and did not
detract or add to the play – they
served their purpose, no more, no
less.
This play runs like a sitcom, a very
long sitcom, so if you’re looking for a
relaxing afternoon or evening of low
intensity theatre viewing, get your
tickets now. But if you are looking
for a mind-bending and thought-
imploring experience, stay at home
and read a book.
