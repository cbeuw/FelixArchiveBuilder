Welcome one again to Felix’s
little corner of impressive
feats, clever tricks and cun-
ning stunts. The topic for this
week is a little controversial
I am afraid, so here comes a
disclaimer:
By reading this article, you
hereby consent to the follow-
ing terms:
1. You won’t be a mup-
pet and hurt yourself while
attempting anything you
learn in these pages, and if
you do, no-one but you is to
blame.
2) If you are a world-
renowned martial artist,
skilled in many deadly
arts and a master of the
Nunchuka, you won’t try to
correct any of this, or try to
threaten me, because I scare
easily.
Right, now that’s over, I
would like to introduce our
topic for the week:
Nunchucka! You don’t have
to do kung fu to play with
these seriously cool sticks-
on-string. The poetic move-
ments associated with batter-
ing an opponent into bloody
submission lend themselves
equally well to showing off
in front of friends, relatives
and (crucially) members of
the opposite sex. Borrowing
movements more traditional-
ly seen in the Maori art of Poi
swinging or the ever-popular
fire staff, the lightning-fast
swings, stops and strikes are
both delicate and awe inspir-
ing.
First, start off with both
‘sticks’ in one hand, with the
chain (or string) hanging
down [see picture 1, right].
Allow the front grip to
fall. As it does, it will swing
down, then swing backwards,
at which point you drop the
other grip [see picture 2].
This will probably end in pain-
ful tears the first time you
try, and from personal experi-
ence I know the grips tend to
gravitate towards the more
tender parts of your anatomy.
If you get it right, however,
the grip you dropped first will
continue its arc around the
back of your hand, ending up
back in your palm, your hand
remaining in contact with the
chain (but not holding it) until
it lands [see picture 3].
Simply reverse the motion
of the nunchuck to end up
back where you started.
Once you have achieved
this, you can pass them across
your body – drop the nun-
chuck as before, and when
the first grip reaches your
palm again, swing the entire
thing across your body so that
the chain wraps around the
back of your other hand, and
the other grip ends up in your
other palm. Repeat ad infini-
tum [see pictures 4, 5 and 6].
You will notice that we have
no idea how to hurt people
with these things, short of
hitting them with a grip ran-
domly during a pattern. If you
intend to get attacked fre-
quently with only two sticks
and a chain between you
and a good kicking, Imperial
has no shortage of martial
arts societies, and one will
certainly take your member-
ship money. Alternatively,
for £3 we can teach you how
to look cool with these, and
let’s face it, that’s the more
important aspect, right?
Email juggling@ic.ac.uk,
come along to juggling on any
Tuesday of term after 6pm
(email for details) and I’ll see
you next week for something
else that I can do but you
can’t.

Ten things I can do that you can’t
EPISODE TWO: Nunchucka
1. Start off with both ‘sticks’ in one hand, with the chain hanging down; 2. Allow the front grip to fall and swing
backwards, at which point drop the other grip; 3. The first grip will continue its arc around the back of your hand,
ending up back in your palm; 4-6. Do the same thing again, but this time swing the entire thing across your body...

2005. A new year. Another
chance for the world to start
afresh.
The past year has seen
needless death and destruc-
tion in many parts of the
world. From the continually
increasing superfluous death
tolls in Iraq to the worst
humanitarian crisis in the
world caused by the civil war
in Darfur, Western Sudan, we
seem to enjoy the battering of
our own human race. As if this
was not enough, nature has
taken a hand in the reduction
of our head count with the
devastating tsunamis in the
Indian Ocean. If only people
would stop fighting around
the world, then nature might
not need to remind us of our
frail existence.
Onalighternote,theworld’s
economy seems to be improv-
ing (before the tsunamis, that
is). Many developing econo-
mies have been experiencing
growth and rapid expansion.
China is, no doubt, the leader
in terms of massive economic
expansion.
In the midst of these worldly
affairs, it is reassuring to note
that certain less important
but joyous occasions do occur
in some parts of the world:
International Night 2005 is
the silver lining in the dark,
heavy clouds.
This year’s International
Night (I-Nite) will prove to
be one of the better ones
that the world has seen so
far. At the top of the list, the
food fair promises a variety
of international delicacies.
With more than ten amaz-
ing stalls (Singaporean, Sri
Lankan, Spanish, etc) to
delight the famished crowd
for the night, patrons will be
spoilt for choice. Each ticket
holder will be given three free
coupons to enjoy the spread
of food. To complete the fabu-
lous dining atmosphere for
the evening, a jazz and rock
band will provide musical
accompaniment.
The performance itself is
an awesome showcase of a
variety of international cul-
tures. With a huge range of
dances, sketches and songs,
the show promises to live up
to its reputation from previ-
ous year and seeks to outdo
itself. Favourites include
a sketch by the Japanese
Society, dances by the Afro-
Caribbean Society and even
a musical by the Singapore
Society!
Saving the best for the last,
no performance night is com-
plete without an after-show
party. Presenting a unique
venue for this year, the party
will blow your mind. With a
critically acclaimed DJ for
the night and a huge hall for
everybody’s dancing needs,
it is time for everybody to do
a little performance of their
own. In all, International
Night 2005 promises to be
the landmark event of the
year!
