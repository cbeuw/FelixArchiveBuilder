Rumours abound that
Imperial’s annual insanity
fest is just around the corner.
Unusually for this College,
the rumours are true. From
7 to 12 February is Imperial
College Union RAG Week, led,
coordinated and occasionally
even organised by your belov-
ed RAG Committee.
RAG stands for Raising
and Giving, and this year’s
nominated charities are
Cancer Research UK and the
Mercury Phoenix Trust.
Just to clear up one thing,
that dalliance the medics
have just engaged in is not
ICU RAG Week. For some
reason, they like to do their
own thing, and not even we
dare to stop them.
Below is a detailed rundown
of the events on the agenda:
Monday 7 February
A quiet start to the week by
collecting around campus.
Tuesday 8 February
This is Shrove Tuesday, so
come along to Beit Quad at
lunchtime and join in a pan-
cake race. The first half is
a traditional egg and spoon
race, but upon completion of
that you will have to add the
egg to the batter and cook
your pancake before complet-
ing the race tossing it. Sounds
tricky? It probably is!
In the evening, the filthy
miners amongst you can con-
gregate for a bar night organ-
ised by your esteemed RSM
committee.
Wednesday 9 February
In line with tradition,
Wednesday afternoon brings
the London Raid. Anything
goes here really. Go around
London collecting cash and
trying to complete crazy chal-
lenges like floating around
fountains in a dinghy or tiddly-
winking the length of Oxford
Street. Join us at the Union in
South Ken afterwards, where
prizes will be awarded for the
best teams and the craziest
stunts!
Thursday 10 February
Thursday evening brings a
City and Guilds Bar Night
and a slave auction into
the ring. Got someone in
the Union you can’t stand?
Mustafa’s hat irritating you?
Then buy them and make
them do what you want! And
if you can’t afford to buy
anyone, enjoy the free beer
instead!
Friday 11 February
Dave’s Distance Dash. In
honour of Dave Willey turn-
ing 21 during RAG Week, you
are all invited to attend an
evening of drinking at The
Goose, North End Road.
Shortly after 11pm, Marvin
the friendly bouncer will ask
us to leave, at which point you
have 36 hours to get as far
away as you can for free.
Saturday 12 February
To finish off the week, we
have a Circle Line pub crawl.
Some of you will already know
that the Circle Line is shut
that weekend, but do not
fear! The committee are out
researching ways to complete
the Circle Line without ever
using a Circle Line train! Will
we manage it? You’ll have to
come along and find out for
yourself!
Sunday 13 February
I will be sleeping or rescuing
what’s left of my degree!
Monday 14 February
Got someone you want to ser-
enade? A partner who needs
to know how much you love
them? (I know this is Imperial,
but you never know!) Get the
Barbershop Quartet to sing to
them in any lecture and then
present them with your mes-
sage and a rose.
All week
City and Guilds Hit Squad. Is
someone irritating you? Well
get them pied! The Hit Squad
can infiltrate anywhere at any
time. To make a booking, just
go the City and Guilds office
in mechanical engineering
and ask!
RAG
RAG Week cometh!

Many of Hollywood’s lat-
est blockbusters rely heav-
ily on Computer Generated
Imagery (CGI) to create
vibrant and imaginative film
sequences which are difficult,
if not impossible, to create
otherwise. While such tech-
nology is often very sophis-
ticated and expensive, it is
becoming more widely acces-
sible to normal consum-
ers and enthusiasts. This is
where Mind’s Eye, Imperial’s
new CGI society, comes in.
As part of a sponsorship
agreement with Alias, the
world’s leading innovator
of 3D graphics technology,
and with help from Escape
Studios, one of Europe’s lead-
ing CGI schools, the soci-
ety will be able to use the
Academy Award winning soft-
ware Maya® 6. The unlim-
ited version of the software
includes Maya Fluid Effects™,
Maya Cloth, Maya Hair, Maya
Fur and Maya Live, allowing
the creation of superior dig-
ital content!
At the moment, the society
will not be providing formal
training for its members, but
the idea is that members will
be able to learn from more
experienced ones through
discussions and the exchange
of techniques and ideas.
Furthermore, the society will
provide a number of training
DVDs and books to allow eve-
ryone to learn at their own
pace.
In addition to learning
the world’s most powerful
3D software, members can
work on their own projects
individually or in teams.
Maybe you’ve always wanted
to work on a game or cre-
ate an animated short? Or
maybe you wanted to create
some 3D graphics to use on
your website? Perhaps you
are into the programming
side of Maya using MEL and
C++? The possibilities are
endless.
According to the student
union’s rules, in order to
make this society become a
reality, at least 20 members
are needed. If you have previ-
ous experience with Maya or
any other 3D software and
are interested, then you are
welcome to join. Also, if you
have no experience with this
sort of thing, don’t be discour-
aged to join – everyone is
welcome.
The society is also in need
of people to be part of its
committee. While this is a
good thing to have on a CV, it
also allows you to be part of
the society’s decision-making
process and its future.
If you are interested, then
send an email to gg104@doc.
ic.ac.uk, stating your name
and CID number.
