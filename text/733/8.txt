Engineering!-
No Thanks?
O K take a break from those
illegible illustrations and
irrelevant equations for a
moment. Think about what
you want to achieve when
you leave IC. Those who
took part in Gary Werskey's
discussion with the A p
Tech society will know
what this is about.
As a school leaver, you
must have had some
enthusiasm for engineering.
Don't let the academic
establishment get you
down! You may be fed up
with all the high powered
technical courses, which
bear very little resemblance
to reality. But persevere!
You must nurture that
desire for a profession
which offers one of the
most exciting, creative and
socially beneficial careers.
As an Engineer you will
be able to develop original
and useful products, apply
abstract knowledge to
solving practical problems,
see the results of your
achievements and be
satisfied with the
recognition that you are an
essential member of
society, who holds the key
s
to wealth creation and
profitability.
Christ! You ought to be
singing and dancing in the
streets at the thought of
such prospects! What more
could anybody want? The
future of society is in your
hands. If you are a
thoroughbred Engineer,
you are destined to make
the world a better place-
and be recognised for it. If
only you would stand up
and fight for what you
want.
'What a load of crap!' I
hear you utter as you reach
for another accountancy
application form. 'I've been
in industry and seen what
has happened to previous
graduate engineers, ie hard
work, low pay, little
responsiblity and slim
prospects. Give me a
bowler hat, a nine to five
job, good prospects and
the sweet smell of M***y. I
don't care about the future
of society for the creation
of wealth. I am quite happy
to provide a parasitic
service and let someone
else develop the means to
pay for my exorbitant
salary. I don't want to
improve society or create
something useful nor am I
interested in feeling the
exhilaration of
technological sucess.
Besides, I have developed
an allegy to swarfega!'
You must realise that
those 'Victims-Engineers'
were not yourself. Your
company is not what it was
then. And even if it is, there
are tremendous
engineering possiblities
with other more
progressive companies.
The great wheel of industry
is starting to turn again and
is hungry for new talent.
You have got to recognise
what you want to achieve
in life, and have realistic
expectations of your
career.
I am not saying that there
won't be any problems,
because there will be
plenty. You will have to
start learning some
engineering for a start-IC
will have taught you little of
real practical use. There is
no substitute for knowledge
gained through hard
experience. You will have
to aquaint yourself with
new products, processes,
customers and suppliers.
This is bound to be tedious
at times. You will also have
to get to know the people
you work with, and make
suse that you will enjoy
their company day after
day. You will have to cope
with conflicts your work
may create. There are
always going to be times
when you get disillusioned
with everything, and cannot
see any way forward.
But these problems are
not unique to engineering.
Why forsake a brilliant
profession when faced with
difficulties which will be
encountered in any exigent
occupations? The 'bowler
hat' alternative may offer
better short term promotion
and financial prospects. It
may hand you convincing
career paths on a plate. But
you would be obtuse to
accept. What would you
achieved Where is the
creative excitement? Why
do someone else's dirty
work, when you could be
doing you own-and actually
create something
worthwhile in the process?
Don't be like a rat-
leaping on to another raft
merely because of its
cosmetic appearance.
Think about the water that
keeps the raft afloat! Who
necessitates audits? Who
issues the shares on which
City sharks gleefully make
a killing? Who creates the
vealth-and in turn provides
some thing in which to
invest the weath? I am not
belittling those in financial
world. Industry cannot
sutvive without them. But
where is the intrigue for
intelligent and potentially
creative students?
As an Engineer, you will
be able to improve things
for so many people.
Industry is starved of the
technically capable such as
yourself. The opportunities
and long term personal
prospects in engineering
are temendous. But you
will have to maintain a
constructive approach as* to
what you want to achieve,
and keep making sensible
demands in order to
succeed.
You had better take down
those equations now-
There's a remote possibility
you might need them one
day!
Oh! And remember, it's
'Engineering?-Yes please!'

Back To
School
Are there any female
students who would be
willing to return to their
schools and talk to other
girls about the
opportunities available to
them in Science and
Engineering, especially at
IC. Although school girls
theoretically have the same
chances as boys, it is still
true that only a small
proportion of them choose
science and technology
subjects for their sixth form
and further education. This
is often because they are
unaware of the possiblities.
Thus many girls miss out
on an interesting,
chatlenging-and lucrative
education and career; and
industry and academics
miss out on a lot of ability.
A new scheme, approved
by the rector, will enable
women students to claim
their expenses from
Coilege when they return
to talk at their schools. This
is a simple and practical
way to pass on to younger
girls, who may never even
have considered a future in
science and engineering,
the benefits of your
success and experience.
The idea is to talk to girls
at pre O'level, Pre A'level
and pre U C C A stages,
these being the times when
crucial decisions are made.
Information Packs
In future a video will be
available to back up the
talk.
If anybody is willing to
'spread the word' in this
way (and have a weekend
at home into the bargain)
contact me, or Margaret
Cunningham the Senior
Tutor for Women, (Huxley

details.

Piss-Artistry
I'm the R C S Academic
Affairs Officer. I'm
supposed to see to it that
the students of the R C S get
fairly represented. Last
Friday I witnessed some
outrageous behaviour on
behalf of the C & G A A O
and the Union President
which should be publicized
in the name of fair
representation.
The Undergraduate
Studies Committee is
collecting lots of
information about the
undergraduates in College-
some via Heads of
Departments, more via the
Students Union. Professor
Blow, who works very hard
as chairman of this
committee, in the interests
of the students must
depend on the information
supplied to him by the
Union. It must therefore be
of the highest calibre and
as thorough as possible.
This requires a lot of time
and experience, but is quite
possible (theoretically) for
the Academic Affairs
Officers and Union
President to achieve;
however this opportunity to
collect realistic an
statistically valid
information, with which the
Undergraduate Studies
Committee can begin to
define our problems has
been squandered. Here is
how:
The objective is to decide
what the students need and
then 'prove' so by survey.
To this end, a preliminary
questionnaire was
tormulated and sent to 'all'
academic reps in College. I
made a set of suggested
questions to add into the
questionnaire, which was
ignored by the President.
Supposedly on the basis of
the results of this
questionnaire, a simpler
and more direct
questionnaire has been
formulated and is now
being sent out to three
sample year groups, Chem
Eng 4, Civ Eng 2, and
Maths 2. According to the
President these year-
groups were selected
because they are of
average size. According to
a more reliable source, and
which is substantiated by
my own experience they
were selected because they
are known to be
particularly dissatisfied
year-groups, who would
then given an extreme
response to this second
questionnaire. Remarkably
enough, its content
coincides with what the
C & G A A O purports to have
maintained all along-ie that
the main areas of concern
are multitude of particular
details about the courses.
Viz:- Too theoretical, too
much work required,
boring, lectures too full,
coursework too demanding,
teachers uninspiring, poor
course structure,
inadequate tutorial.
Notably, if you agree with
any of these criticisms you
indicate so by ringing the
'plus 2'; the minuses are for
when you are 'too' happy
with your course!
Myself, being 1) not
reknowned for turning up
to all Union Meetings, and
2) reknowned for housing
that rare quality known as
morality, was not consulted
as to the content or format
of those questionnaire, or
to whom it would be sent
and why.
It is proposed that on the
basis of what Chem Eng 4,
Civ Eng 2, Maths 2 say on
these subjects, we can
state the opinion of the
student body as a whole.
Although it may at first just
appear to be 'at least a step
in the right direction' even
if rather restricted' It
cannot qualify even for this
because the results will be
useless. It is short-sighted
and narrow-minded and
has wasted our opportunity
to tell the Board of Studies
exactly what we need. Most
students will obviously
agree that there is room for
improvement in each of the
above categories in their
course albeit with different
improvements in different
places for different
departments. But what will
it mean in terms of action
to be taken? Should the
course be made less
theoretical? Should there
be fewer subject in the
syllabus? This is what
would be implied if the
College is to adapt to the
above and it would
seriously detract from the
value of a degree from IC
in the eyes of most
employers. Besides which it
is simply not feasible to
implement such changes
due to the amount of
adminstration (equals
money) it would require.
And it is not reasonable to
ask for such changes on
the basis a special sample
group of students. Even if
individual departments took
steps to tackle these
problems, the effort would
be unjustified because by
their nature the above are
localised, transient
problems with a timescale
of a few years or less. By
the time anything real
began to happen, they
would be either completely
different or no longer there.
So, you may ask, having
disqualified what the
President and the C & G
A A O are doing about
student needs, just what
am I doing about it myself?
My answer is this—I do not
know the answers, but I do
know the problem. The
best way to begin to tackle
it is to try to make students
aware of it. There is an
underlying factor,
connected with all these
complaints which will still
be there for years to come.
Whilst we cannot say that
in a few years' time the
most vociferous complaints
will still be in Maths 2, we
can say that there will
definitely be somebody
somewhere who is very
dissatified with his/her
course, regretting ever
taking the subject (Know
the feeling?) The particular,
departments are transient,
irrelevant to the
fundamental problem. After
all, are we really going to
sugests that the people
who run this college, who
have been addressing
exactly these problems and
very many more for many
years and whose objectives
is to achieve the maximum
number of well-qualified
graduates, are that far out
of touch with the students?
Are the departmental
staff/students committees
really that useless? The
anwsers is "no' where, then
is the problem? There is
only one other place to
look if it isn't them, it must
be us. It is the attitude of
the students that should
change.
We all arrive here like
spoilt children and expect
everyone around us to
adapt to our specifications.
We are completely unable
to look beyond are own
little environs to the wider
context of our situation as
students of Imperial
College, about to obtain a
qualification that will label
us for life. Imperial College
is one of the best existing
places for getting a good
scientific/technical
education, respected
throughout the World for
turning out capable people.
While we are here, we
should be grateful for the
opportunity take such a
privilege. The academic
staff teach us or try to
because they value there
subject, they value
knowledge itself, and
because they value the
aptitude that each of us has
shown for our subject.
Instead of appreciating this
and helping with
constructive criticisms, we
just take it all for granted
and trust completely in a
few people to represent us.
Unfortunately they are all
to often unable or unwilling
to do so. We pick on
superficial points about
which to argue, in the
vague hope that somebody
somewhere somehow can
just flick a switch and solve
it all.
The department of our
College have only recently
started using student
questionaires and trying to
listen out for what we have
to say. Obviously we
should state the case as we
see it, but we should bear
in mind that motives and
objectives of the
staff/student comittese, and
see things from a collective
point of view, the academic
staff and the students are
equally vital organs of
Imperial College and we
should see ourselves as
part of the same body in
many repects. They are on
our side: our real enemy is
mutual and lies outside the
College. Pete Klemperer
Bookshop
News
Our annual book sale will
be held early in March it
will include diaries,
calenders and stationery
items. All will be reduced at
least 20%.
If you can't find the book
you require, don't be
frightened to ask,
unfortunatley there are
times when lectureers tell
you to buy a cetain book
but haven't asked me to
stock it. If this is the case
tell me so I can get stock
in.
Bookshop
Once again may I point
out that book prices are set
by the publisher and we
have to sell at their price.
Stationery is a different
matter in most cases we
sell at below RRP. We
stock a wide range of
drawing instruments and
boards if you can't see
what you want ask, as
some stock has to be
stored behind the counter
Over the next few weeks
various publishes will be
exhibiting their new titles in
our window, lecturers there
may just be the title you
want to recommend for the
coming year.
As from 24 February the
Sportshop will be open
11.00am to 2.30pm,
Monday to Friday. Any
suggestions for new items
are welcome. At the
moment we have either T-
shirts or sweatshirts for the
following clubs, Chaps,
Keepfit, Badminton and
Water Polo, Lambswool
jumpers for Hockey, Judo,
