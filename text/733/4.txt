Public School
Snot Attacked
Dear Hugh,
; I must admit to feeling
I slightly sick while reading
the 'opinions' of the
anonymous Physics
\ undergraduate in your
letters page last week.
That this self-styled pillar
J of College Society should
be misguided enough to
I think that '..the 'old boys'
are the only ones that
! really do know how things
should be done' is
unfortunate, but that he
should be sufficiently self-
opinionated and vain to
state his prejudices in print
I is unforgivable.
As one who has had the
supposed benefit of a
public school education I
find it hard to understand
how anyone can believe
I that the mere fact of having
affluent parents enables
one to claim any kind of
social superiority per se.
Perhaps this enlightened
correspondent should
I further examine his claim
not to be a snot, as at the
very least do us all a favour
by keeping quiet about his
petty little problems in the
future.
Yours sincerely,
Charles Troup

FELIX Error 3
Dear Mr Southey,
We write in response to
the article, printed in last
week's FELIX, under the
heading of S&G.
May we take the
opportunity to dispel a few
mis-conceptions which may
have arisen from this
article, printed
anonymously as club
publicity without the
knowledge of the
committee.
Firstly, the S&G
committee exists for a
variety of purposes, but
their task is definitely not
to organise routes for all
and sundry. Members on
weekends are assumed to
be old enough to decide for
themselves what they wish
to attempt, and are only
discouraged from acting on
their decision, when to do
so would involve unsafe
actions (such as walking
alone in winter conditions).
The writer's attitude is
totally unrepresentative of
the majority of S & G
members. Fortunately for
the club many of*our more
experienced members are
willing to tread familiar
paths in order to introduce
beginners to the delight of
Tryfan, the Glyders, the
Snowdon Horseshoe etc.
Also, there are many ways
up a mountain, not just the
most popular routes-several
groups were ice-climbing
on Snowdon on the
weekend in question.
' T o dispel any fears, S & G
don't walk about in twelves.
Three totally independant
groups headed up Tryfan
that day, and two decided
to turn back in the face of
deteriorating conditions.
As for exploring, within
the last year or so, the club
has organised weekends to
Snowdonia, the Lakes,
Yorkshire, Derbyshire, the
Mendips, Cornwall, the
Gower and Pembrokeshire
as well as week-long trips
to Glencoe, Ireland and the
Lake District. During the
summer there were two
club tours to the
Polish/Czech Tatras and
the Italian Alps. This
Easter, we will be visiting
Skye, and the summer tour
this year is to the Pyrenees.
Hardly limiting in outlook...
The activities available on
these trips include winter
and rock climbing, caving,
scrambling and walking
according to the interests
of those present and the
area visited.
As with all these things,
when the opportunity is
there it's up to you to make
of it what you will.
Yours,
S&G Committee 1985-86
Apathy Rules
Dear Sir,
A week and half ago I went
on a fascinating trip to
Rolls Royce Engines,
organised by the Industrial
Society. We travelled in the
comfort of a British Rail
train, and a van was waiting
at Coventry station to
transfer us to the
plant...and the whole trip
was absolutely free! And
yet, only seven students
took advantage of this
amazing opportunity.
What the hell is the
matter with us? We will
never have these
opportunities again, so why
do we not use the facilities
available to us? On arrival
at the plant, our guide
asked how many of us were
from Mech Eng. The
answer...NOT O N E ! What is
your problem? You are the
people who will be working
in this sort of company, so
shouldn't you be finding
out what these places get
up to?
Please do not take this
attack personally. It is
directed at the general
attitude (ie apathetic) of
most of us students at IC. I
propose that a new club
should be started; namely
the Apathetic Society.
Everyone will automatically
be a member unless they
sign up not to be. I feel
confident that such a
society would not lose a
single member.
Actively yours,
Michael Van Messel

Moonies Respond
Dear Hugh,
I read Alastair Macleod's
letter in last week's FELIX
with some irritation. It was
admittedly a masterly feat
of journalism, skilfully
using innuendo all the way
through to cast aspersions
both on the academic
credibility of Dr Barker in
her study of the Unification
Church, and on the
integrity of the Unification
movement as a whole. But
also masterly was the way
in which he omitted most
of the relevant facts
surrounding Dr Barker's
study—and invented a few
of his own—in the process.
Therefore, lets me attempt
to set the record straight.
1) Documentary Evidence
Mr Macleod suggests that
the arguments put forward
by Mr Balcomb in defence
of C A R P were supported
only by Dr Barker's one
study. In fact Mr Balcomb's
letter was submitted to
FELIX with a large quantity
of supporting documentary
evidence. In any case,
other studies refuting the
'brainwashing' hypothesis
were alluded to in that
letter, a fact ignored by Mr
Macleod. Among the
leading sociologists who
reject this hypothesis are
Professor J H Fichter, S J
and Dr Bryan Wilson (All
Souls College, Oxford) who
is probably the leading
authority in this country on
the study of new religious
movements.
2) Dr Barker was 'chosen'
by the Unification Church
Mr Macleod also states
that 'Dr Barber (sic) was
'chosen' by the Unification
Church to conduct her
studys (sic)'. If, by his use
of quotation marks, he
means to suggest that the
Church agreed to co-
operate with the study,
then his claim is correct.
However, he goes on to
suggest that this 'choosing'
might in some way have
prejudiced the results of
the study. It should be
noted in this regard that
the study won Dr Barker a
doctorate and the 1985
Distinguishing Book Award
of the Society for the
Scientific Study of Religion,
the latter being the most
prestigous international
award for books on
religion. Dr Barker's work
was particularly noted for
her inscrutable
methodology and
objectivity. Mr Macleod
appears to concede this
when he states tht she
'quite rightly draws
conclusions only as far as
the volume of evidence
permits.'
3) Evidence of
'Brainwashing'
On the subject of
'brainwashing', Mr
Macleod's comments in his
letter leave one with the
impression that Dr Barker's
conclusions on this subject
are ambivalent: that
members say that it doesn't
happen and 'leavers' say
that it does. Dr Barker in
fact found that, out of 1,000
attenders at a Unification 2-
day seminar, only 'a few'
made any suggestion in the
direction of undue
persuasion. Of the four
strongest statements made
(Barker at PP 159-160),
none even use the term
'brainwashing'. Elsewhere
in her book, however, she
gives her own opinion: that
use of the term to describe
conversion into the
Unification Church is
totally unjustified;
4) 'Political activities of the
U C and 'Divine Deception'.
Mr Macleod also alludes
mysteriously to 'political
activities' supposedly
undertaken by the
Unification Church. I
cannot see that there is
anything unusual in a
church involving itself
politically. In fact, I would
find it hard to think of a
church which did not. He
further alludes to a
'unification concept of
'Divine Deception'. In over
seven years of membership
in the Unification Church, I
have never heard this term
used.
In conclusion, I can only
repreat Mr Balcomb's plea
for all IC students to find
out for themselves the truth
about C A R P and the
Reverend Moon, and not to
trust the jaundiced
opinions of such as Mr
Macleod.
Yours sincerely,
Dr Colin Turfus
