FELIX
Over the last few weeks
FELIX has received a large
number of letters and
opinion articles. FELIX is
always really keen to
receive letters. A student
newspaper relies on input
from students if it is to be
fresh and interesting. There
has been a certain amount
of debate within the FELIX
Office and outside the
Office on what FELIX'S
policy on letters etc should
be. As far as I'm
concerned, I try to print
any opinion that is received
before 1.30pm on Monday.
I can't always manage this
because of space. I am
prepared to to withold
names if people request me
to.
Sabbatical Elections
There is still time to stand
in the sabbatical elections.
The pay is pretty bad but
you don't have to go to
lectures or live on the dole.
If you want to stand, go
and see any of the
sabbaticals today.
Next week you will be
bombarded by publicity
from the various sabbatical
candidates. Try to read all
the leaflets and read all the
speeches. The sabbaticals
control your money and
. represent you to College,
so try to find who is the
best person for the job.
Money For Nothing
You can earn Â£2 an hour by
sitting next to a ballot box
during the sabbatical
elections. Contact Jen in
the Union Office for details.
Manifestos
Manifestos must be submit-
ted to the FELIX Office by
1pm Monday. They must be
less than 300 words long.
They should be accompan-
ied by a photograph.

Moore Bar
Moans
Dear Sir,
I don't recall the original
incident which saw the
departure of Doug and
Brian from the Union Bar.
With the benefit of
hindsight, I expect that it
was a most trivial mishap
which has now culminated
in the most usual-and
unacceptable state of
affairs which the bar now
finds itself in.
I refer to the recent
declaration by the current
Bar Manager, Mr Lyttle, of
his intention to dictate to
his customers the manners
in which the Bar should be
used, made manifest by a
notice above the
mantlepiece in the said Bar.
Essentially, the word and
spirit of the notice seeks to
prohibit the merry making
practiced by some of the
more high-spirited
organisations within
Imperial College. This is a -
bad thing.
The first two years of my
College life were enhanced
by the weekly enjoyment of
convivial company in the
Union Bar after a game of
Rugby. As such, this made
a valued contribution to my
varied and fulfilling social
life at College. Is this to be
denied to future students at
Imperial College?
Since Mr Lyttle obviously
has no consideration for
his customers, and total
disregard for his position
as a purveyor of service,
perhaps he would care to
take some business advice
from a customer: I'd much
prefer to do my quiet
drinking in the charming
surroundings of Southside
Bar, and if the objective is
to smarten up appearances
I also have a suggestion as
to where a start could be
made.
Yours,

Disreputable
NUS
Dear Hugh,
In reply to Pete Hobbis',
letter (FELIX 731) I would
like to'pass on some
realities of the organisation
that K Q C students have
just affiliated to.
The National Union of
Students is a disreputable
organisation of students,
present only because it is a
'closed shop' for all
universities and colleges
who are affiliated. It spends
the vast majority of its over
a million pounds on an
annual conference and
administration. This means
that the British taxpayer
spends nearly a million
pounds on supporting an
organisation which
encourages policies of 'no
platform', denying free
speech, and donations from
everything like the 1983
N G A dispute and the 1984-
5 miners' strike to
conferences on paedophilia
and transvestites.
If you want another
account of the NUS in
action, read the account of
the NUS conference given
by none other than J
Martin Taylor, in last years'
FELIX. This conference
results in no positive gain,
and costs about half of the
total NUS budget. Indeed,
the NUS is presently
around half a million
pounds in debt, so you can
see why they might look
with a gleam in their eyes
at Imperial College Union
which runs many expensive
and effective clubs and
societies on a scale not
seen elsewhere. Bear in
mind, also, that when
Edinburgh University left
the NUS in a span of a few
years they saved two
hundred thousand pounds,
and built a restaurant and
bars and more with the
money. Is this not of better
benefit to students than a
'national representation' of
students, when no
government of any colour
has ever acted on NUS
policy!
If the NUS were
somehow miraculously to
become voluntary, you
might than see some reality
creeping in as no-one
would join the present
organisation if they had to
pay! If the NUS is so good,
why is it compulsory?
Yours,

Computer MScs
Are OK
Dear Sir,
To put an end to a
somewhat ridiculous row, I
would like to correct a few
inaccuracies included in a
letter, two weeks ago, from
a 3rd year computing U G ,
who felt compelled to
complain about the
behaviour of a certain P G
student during Artificial
Intelligence lectures.
Firstly, the Al lectures are
attended by 3rd year
Computing UG's,
Computing MSc's on the
conversion course and
students on a robotics
course. It so happens that
the offender mentioned in
the letter belongs to the
robotics course, because if
the 3rd years do not
recognise him as one of
theirs, neither do we.
Secondly, although the
obnoxious behaviour is
indeed resented by all but
the offender himself, it is
felt that the generalisation
that 'provincial' universities
are inferior to IC is far-
stretched; Edinburgh
University, for one, has an
Al department as reputable
as, if not more than, IC's.
Thirdly, some 3rd years
may think little of the MSc
conversion course; to
restore the reputation, may
I point out that the only
student to correctly answer
a challenge in Al posed by
Professor Kowalski was a
student on the MSc
conversion course.
Finally, we are
supposedly a free country,
so why not have the
courage of your
convictions and allow your
name to be printed?
Yours faithfully,
H Guillamme
