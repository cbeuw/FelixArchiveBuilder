Sainsbury's Under Siege
Winner Drawn
The 1986 IC Union Survey draw took place last Friday.
Rosemary Hosking, FELIX receptionist, drew Simon Singh
Physics 2 and M Holyoak Life Sciences 1 who won IC
Sweatshirts. Eight other lucky students won runners up
prizes.
The results of the survey are now being compiled.
Survey organiser Gren Manuel commented T h e response
was very good and my thanks go to everyone who replied.'
Correction
Dave Brennan, a former
student of the Life Sciences
Department, had not been
banned from College as
stated in last week's FELIX
732. He has been banned
from the Union. College
has not taken any
disciplinary action yet.
The article, headlined
'Banned' did not refer to
Dave Brennan, Physics 1.
FELIX would like to
apologise for any
inconvenience which may
have been caused by the
ambiguity.
Hunger
Project
Representatives from the
Hunger Project will be
setting up a stall on
Monday lunchtimes in Beit
Quad. The organisation, a
registered charity, aims to
inform the public of the
hunger problem in
underdeveloped countries.
'We hope to see an infant
mortality of less than fifty
in every country by the end
of the century' said a
spokesman for the
organisation.
Guilds
Election
Adrian Johnson is the only
candidate for President of
Guilds at the time of
writing. Papers will remain
up until 5.30pm on
Monday. Guilds President
Roger Preece encouraged
people to consider running
for one of the Guilds
executive posts.
Harlington
Fears
Hockey club and cricket
club are worried about the
plans for the extraction of
gravel from the Harlington
sports ground. They are
worried that the
groundsmen will have
insufficient time to prepare
pitches. Hockey and cricket
pitches take two years to
prepare. Athletics Ground
Committee is meeting club
captains on March 10 to
discuss the needs of the
clubs. IC Union President
Carl Burgess said that at
present the plans meant
that the number of pitches
would be maintained but
the quality could not be
guaranteed.
Students from Imperial
College's Anti-Apartheid
Society mounted a picket
outside Sainsbury's in,
Cromwell Road on
Saturday. They handed
leaflets to shoppers, urging
them to put pressure on
Sainsbury's to stop
stocking South African fruit
and other goods.
Sainsbury's were among
the first major chains to
respond to the Anti-
apartheid movements
campaign against South
African goods, saying that
they would make sure such
goods were clearly labelled,
and seek alternative
sources of supply. Since
then, several major
retailers—British Home
Stores, Littlewoods, Asda
and Harris
Queensway—have
announced that they will no
longer stock South African
goods. (In additon, the C o -
op have had such a policy
for sometime). The
leafleting campaign aims to
press Sainsbury's to join
them. The picket is to be
repeated: this Saturday it
will be at the North End
Road store, and next week,
back at Cromwell Road.
