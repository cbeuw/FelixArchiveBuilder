Insecure Beit
Dear Sir,
Whilst I sympathise with
Southside Security
problems, it is nothing
compared with those of
Beit Hall. Most of the halls
have doors which are
closed early in the evenings
if not all day, whereas the
doors to Beit are only
closed at Midnight. The
doors are not properly self-
locking either, so that they
may remain open at any
time of the day or night.
Also, being in the Union
building, Beit is the centre
of a large throughput of
people. In addition, Hall
facilities seem to be let out
to outsiders eg during the
Hyde Park Relays and
National Brass Band
Championships without the
residents being informed. It
is not fun to wake up on a
Saturday morning to find
the already inadequate
showers used by total
strangers, and like last
year, the male and female
conveniences had been
temporarily swapped over.
All this leads to a very
unsecure Hall, and this is
shown by the state of the
TV Lounge in the
mornings, the thefts of the
newspapers, and as
recently, a minor fire in one
of the kitchens. The
Security guards in Beit do
a marvellous job, but it
appears that the rules for
Beit are different. Why?
The problem could easily
be solved by the
installation of 3 proper
locks and three entry
phones as with the other
halls and homes.
Yours sincerely,
Tony Spencer

Forget The Ratio
Sir,
I am sick and tired of
certain members of the
college who insist on
bringing to light the ratio of
sexes at IC.
First it was FELIX with its
'Questionaire', and now the
Women's Officer, Christine
Taig has brought up the
subject. It seems to me that
the more this topic is
raised, the more self-
conscious women will
become, and also the
sexual divide will increase.
To be honest I do not
notice the lack of women in
my year, where I admit the
ratio of 1 in 4 is above
average, but I am not
intimidated by the ratio
socially either, despite
having been brought up in
a totally female
environment, and I couldn't
care less if I was the only
woman in the Union Bar on
a Mines Bar Night.
As for the idea of positive
discrimination to get more
women into the College. If
anything would serve to
lower women's credibility in
Science and Technology in
general, and Imperial
College in particular, it
would be a situation where
men could turn round to
women and say 'You're
only here because you are
female'.
Perhaps my view is not
representative of the
general feeling among
women in the College, but I
cannot believe I am the
only one to think this way.
Yours equally and anti-
discriminatorilyf!)

FELIX Error 1
Dear FELIX,
Thank you for printing our
opinion article about
Barclays in last weeks
FELIX. There was however
a printing error. It should
have read that 77% of all
urban black South Africans
interviewed in the Gallup
poll supported international
sanctions against South
Africa, as do black church
leaders and opposition
politicians.
Barclays' involvement in
South Africa and Namibia
cannot be overstated and
S W A P O have said that 'the
withdrawal of Barclays
from our country and the
cessation of its activities in
South Africa would hasten
the achievement of peace
and justice in Namibia and
Southern African as a
whole'.
Because the majority of
people tend to remain with
their first bank, students
have always been of vital
importance to the banks.
Many organisations of all
kinds and countless
individuals have withdrawn
their accounts from
Barclays. Since 1980 the
Bank has lost accounts
with a total annual turnover
of over £6 billion due to the
boycott. Hopefully Barclay?
will realise that they are
prospering in Southern
Africa at the expense of
their UK Interests.
Please come to the U G M
on 6 March and support the
motion against Barclays
advertising in ICU
publications.
Thank you,

FELIX Error 2
Dear Sir,
I know how the Bishop of
Durham feels to be quoted
out of context in the press.
To avoid excommunication
or possible lightening
strikes on the Queens
Tower for apparently
stating that Jesus was a
'good moralist and
preacher but would have
been regarded as a lunatic
if he made his claims
today'. I would like to state
briefly the main points of
the talk last week to clear
up any possibly confusion.
Firstly, Jesus a person
worth looking at because of
the major effect his three
years of public ministry has
had on world history.
Secondly, many people
think of him as being a
great moral teacher without
really knowing much about
what he taught. Many tend
to forget the claims he
made about himself to be
the Messiah, Saviour, one
who embodied and
demonstrated G o d to the
world, who forgave sin and
showed the way to a new
and full life in relationship
with God. It is those claims
that are the foundation of
Christian belief.
These claims do not give
room for saying that Jesus
was just a good moral
teacher', that option is not
really left open for us. He
was either completely
crazy; completely bad, or
lying to people or he was
who he claimed to be.
I have, myself, become
convinced of the latter
through looking at the
evidence and through
personal experience of God
in my life.
It is for everyone to make
up their own mind on this
area. If the claims of Jesus
are true, then the decision
as to whether we accept
them or not becomes vitally
important. If they are not,
then the whole of
Christianity should be
relegated to just being an
interesting piece of history.
Either way, what
responsibly person rejects
something out of hand
without giving it some
personal thought and
practical investigation.
Yours sincerely,
Roger Preece
