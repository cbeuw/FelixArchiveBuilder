World exclusive
The Yanks Are
Coming
Academic staff at Imperial
College are concerned that the
classification of research work
by American officials in
connection with SDI will
jeopardise important civil
projects. It is believed that
research work carried out at
Imperial and a number of other
British universities will soon be
placed under American
scrutiny. Research with
potential military applications is
expected to be placed on the
U.S Military Critical
Technologies List (MCTL) with
subsequent restrictions in the
use and publication of it's
findings.
The academics are worried
that the Memorandum of
Understanding signed by the
then Secretary of State for
Defence Michael Heseltine and
American Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinberger allows the
Americans to classify British
research.
The Pentagon have initiated a
study by Mr Paul Hopler.the
Chief Technology Analyst at the
Department of Defence, who is
resposible for the MCTL's
annual updating. Mr Hopler has
described the study as 'a
general programme looking into
foreign capability jn very
advanced technologies'. The
study will produce an interim
report in April followed by a full
report on N A T O members and
Japan. The possible extension
of the US Export Administration
Act, which restricts exportation
of sensitive technologies
through the Coordinating
Committee of Multilateral
Export Control (COCOM) is
now being considered in
Congress. The implication is
that research work may be
added to the M C T L along with
sensitive products. It is believed
that preventing technologies
which may have a future
military application from
appearing on the market is
more effective than restricting
exports.
Sources have revealed that
representatives from BK
Dynamics and the Institute For
Defence Analysis will arrive at
the American Embassy
sometime next week to examine
a list of companies and
academics working on research
with potential military
applications. It is believed that
Imperial College is one of the
institutions to appear on the list.
Speaking in the Commons on
Wednesday Norman Lamont MP
said that 'United States
authorities do not require the
British government's approval
before approaching British
academic groups'
Chris Moss, the secretary of
the Computing and Social
Responsibility group at IC told
FELIX that he hoped 'people
will tell the companies a
minimum amount' should the
visit take place. Professor
Kowalski of the Computing
Department felt that the
companies would not exert
direct pressure on people in the
department in order to ensure
that research work is kept
classified. He hinted that
indirect pressure may be
applied when he said 'the M O D
could become a more aggresive
member of Alvey'.
Richard Ennals resigned his
post at IC in order to outline the
possible dangers which could
follow the signing of the
Memorandum of Understanding.
He feels that the British
government has been
'hoodwinked' and were unaware
of these dangers. He also
believes that SDI may be more
offensive than defensive. He
cited General Abrahamson head
of the SDI office in Washington,
who stated that SDI was 'a
shield to protect US missiles'.
He added that it would be
easier to use the SDI
technology to destroy cities
rather than to destroy moving
missiles. 'If classification were
to go ahead, British civil
programmes would not have
access to the technology they
require', he said. He feels that
the Government will 'seek to
extricate itself from this stupid
arrangement as the implications
become clearer. I am prepared
to take the matter to the
American Supreme Court
without "due process of law"'.
A spokesman from the
American Embassy in London
confirmed that General
Abrahamson did indeed say that
SDI would shield American
missiles. He pointed out that
this was only part of the story
and had to be viewed in the
light of SDI's main objective to
make ICBMs redundant. He
added that he didn't think laser
weapons would be sufficiently
powerful to destroy cities. When
questioned about the possible
classification of British research
work he confirmed that IDA will
be sending a team over to
'identify technologies which will
have future military
applications'. He went on to say
'the same protection that the US
places on its research will be
placed on British research'.
Although he felt that the United
States had no legal right to tell
the UK to classify research, 'the
US government in cooperation
with the British government
could classify research'.
