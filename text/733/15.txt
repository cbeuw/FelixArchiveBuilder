«! Holland To Be Moved
The Holland Club is to be relocated in the Sherfield
Building because of structural problems with the present
building. A survey of the present Holland Club building
has revealed major structural defects in the roof, the main
structural beam and the internal partitions. The estimated
costs of remedying these defects is £255,000.
The post room and the old telephone exchange in the
basement of the Sherfield Building will be converted to
provide space for a bar, a snooker room and a room for
table tennis or social occasions.
At their meeting on November 8 the Finance and
Executive Committees of the Governing Body approved
the move in view of the cost of rehabilitation, the cost of
adapting the building to other uses and the fact that
demolition would provide a valuable clear site for future
expansion for academic purposes.
The cost of adaptations in the Sherfield Building are
estimated at £89,000 and the demolition of the Holland
Club and the work to make good the east face of the
Huxley Building will cost an estimated £70,000
The proposals have been agreed with officers of the
Holland Club.

Louts Out
Four students have been
rehoused in alternative
College accommodation
following 'disruptive
behaviour' in Southwell
house in Evelyn Gardens.
The Rector, Professor Eric
Ash was initially unwilling
to rehouse them in College
property, but later relented
on humanitarian grounds.
The students concerned
are alleged to have caused
damage and inconvenience
to other residents over the
past six months. It has
been reported that their
behaviour was instrumental
in the resignation of the
former house warden, Mrs
Artgale.
Parsons Flies
Royal Schoorof Mines
student Geoff Parsons won
a bronze medal in the
European Indoor
Championships in Madrid.
Mr Parsons was competing
for Great Britain against
the Soviet Union at Cosford
on Tuesday.
More Women
The new Working Party on
the Admission of more
women students is
proposing a series of 2-day
residential courses for 6th
form girls. The committee
is headed by Margaret
Cummingham, the senior
tutor for women students.
The courses would include
lectures and laboratory
sessions in several
departments. The Working
Party has estimated the
cost of each course to be
approximately £1400. To go
ahead they would need the
approval of the Rector,
Professor Ash, and the
support of the majority of
departments. The Rector is
commited to doubling the
proportion of women at
Imperial College by 1993.
The Physics Department
is planning a programme
involving staff and students
in going to visit schools.
Imperial College Union has
expressed an interest in
assisting College to attract
women students. The ICU
reprsentatives on the
Working Party are Womens
Officer Christine Taig and
Academic Affairs Officer J
Martin Taylor. The
committee will be meeting
again on Wednesday 12
March.
NUS March
Imperial College students joined about 25000 other
students on an N U S protest march about government
benefit cuts from County Hall to the D H S S offices and on
to a rally at a park in Elephant and Castle.
Some of the IC contingent joined a group of students,
led by Chris Boomer of P C L , who decided to march to
Westminster. This group felt that a more direct protest was
needed. The large but friendly police presence quickly
caught on and proved an efficient escort and little
obstruction until the group reached Festival Gardens. Here
the police prevented the students crossing the Thames. A
group of about 150 students still found a way to 10
Downing Street.
Melliar-Smith
Resigns
Tom Melliar-Smith has
resigned from his post as
Hon Sec of R C S U . This
follows the discovery that
he is not a registered
student at IC, and so is not
a member of R C S U or of
ICU. Mr Melliar-Smith has
also resigned as G U C
Delegate, and as ordinary
member on ICU Council,
Bar Committee and Internal
Services Committee.
Mr Melliar-Smith told
FELIX that the position had
arisen due to a
misunderstanding between
his department, the college
registry, and himself. He
had discovered that his
name had been omitted
from the registry list shortly
after Christmas. In order to
avoid the chaos that a
rushed election of a new
Hon Sec would cause, Mr
Melliar-Smith chose not to
resign until after the
Annual Dinner on February
7.
Mr Melliar-Smith
admitted that he had
handled the organisation of
the dinner unwisely. Willie
Rushton, the expected
guest speaker, had not
fallen ill with apendicitus,
as had been orignally
reported (See FELIX
February 7). Mr Melliar-
Smith had invited Mr
Rushton through friends of
his aunt, but had
discovered one month
before the dinner that Mr
Rushton had not been
booked. He decided not to
make this generally known
so as not to discourage
students from attending the
Dinner. He agreed that this
had been a mistake.
There was no mention of
Mr Melliar-Smiths
resignation at the R C S
hustings U G M on Monday.
RCS President Simon
Redlich said that he did not
think that the hustings
U G M was the right place to
announce the resignation.
No Haddock
Grab Grab The Haddock,

present Ents are trying to
