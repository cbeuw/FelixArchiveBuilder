Relative relatives
I was recently visiting my
rather odd friends the
Groper family, who also
had some relatives staying
at the time. There were six
of us at lunch that day,
including me, and I decided
to ask how they were
related to each other
(thankfully I am not related
to any of them). Since they'
knew I enjoyed logic
puzzles thy made a rather
feeble attempt to stump
me. The following
statements were made by
different people:
Humphrey is my father's
brother. Claudia is my
mother-in-law. Ignatious is
my son-in-law's brother.
Henrietta is my brother's
wife.
I worked it out instantly,
of course, but it later
occured to me that, even if
I hadn't known the family, it
would still have been
possible to work out how
mEenBRfiin
they were related from
these four statements, as
long as I had known that
every person refered to in
the statements was one of
the five (ie in the first
statement 'my father' was
one of the five, as well as
'my father's brother').
So can you tell me who
made each statement, and
how the five others at lunch
were all related?
Since permutation
problems seem to be
popular, I thought I'd set
this one which I found
quite difficult. I'll be
interested to see how many
Correct answer I get. As
usual, there will be a £5
prize for a randomly picked
correct entry handed in
before 1.00pm Tuesday.
Ladders-Solution
The problem, essentially,
was to work out the
distance X in the diagram
below.
Although this will
eventually give the correct)
answer, there is a neater
way of doing it. Consider
writing the two sloped lines
in the form y=mx+c with O
as the origin. The point at
which they meet is simply
the solution of these two
simultaneous equations,
and the answer, after two
lines of algebra is
I was inundated with
trigonometry: sine rules

which is about 5 feet 111
/2
inches. So Mobius can just
get under, assuming, as a
couple of people noted,
that he has a triangular
head!
