Fencing
Rugby
ICFC had a busy week last
week with two matches
against other local
'colleges. On Wednesday
we defeated Kings Collega
in a two weapon match.A
comfortable 6-3 margin
decided the foil where the
team's only problem was a
disagreement over what
consititues a stop-hit. The
epee match could not be
completed due to a Kings
fencer breaking their only
left handed epee. Thus
instead of winning 7-2 , we
had to make do with 6-2.
Worthy of note was David
Matthews' two victories at
epee, a weapon with which
he is not familiar.
On Friday we had our
return match against U C ,
winning by 18 fights to 9.
U C were weaker in their
foil team and we won 5-4.
Again the sabre was a
whitewash, we won 8-1.
The epee score was 5-4 but
with an indicator of plus 17,
means the match was not
as close as it appears.
There was also a novices
match of twelve bouts which
resulted in a 6-6 draw. John
Franks fought well, winning
all his fights and conceeding
only four hits.
The next match is against
Q M C on Friday 7 March.
Rifle
Inter C C U small bore pistol
match
R C S 695 C & G 692
Last Wednesday saw R C S
and C & G compete in the
annual pistol match. Mines
were unable to field a team
this year.
RCS with their very
experienced team,
threequarters of last years
University of London team,
were expecting to win
easily.C&G fielded an
inexperienced team; this
was the first competition
most had shot in.
In the end the match was
extremely close with R C S
winning by 3 points. The
top individual scores of the
day were 178 from Steve
Brooker and E Blance, The
former winning on the
number of 'Bulls' socred,
and stopping R C S winning
everything.
IC 38pts WASPS 3pts
ICRFC 1st XV entertained a
WASPS XV on Saturday in
bitterly cold conditions and
in a frozen pitch. It proved
to be an opportunity for the
IC team to work on forward
solidity and run through
some dashing back moves.
All the scoring in the first
half was attributed to
Folland as he crossed for
three tries, one of which he
converted. The second try
was the pick of these as it
followed excellent first
phase possession as a neat
break by Anderson running
at full-pace. Wasps only
reply was a first half
penalty.
The second half saw the
IC pack tear into the
opposition and produce a
constant stream of good
second phase possession.
The backs consistently
broke through the Wasps
cover releasing Seccombe,
the flying Welshman, on
numerous runs. Twice he
touched down but missed
out on his hat-trick by
deliberately allowing a
Wasps prop to catch him
just before full-time whistle.
It was 'Boogie-woogie'
Goetz who again scored
two tries and shone for IC
in the back-row. He
recieved good support in
the mauls from Chris
Dancer, ugly as ever, and a
solid second-row platform
in the shape of Roly and
Rawell. Despite earlier fears
over injuries only Steve
Pierer-Rives sustained a
knock, but nothing to keep
him out of next Sunday's
(March 2!) Gutterridge
final-weather permitting!
Badminton
U A U Ladies
Team Championships
The first game was our first
pair, Robin Martin and
Sarah Threadgold, against
Leed's first pair. Despite
the fact that the Leeds pair
contained the individual
UAU ladies singles winner,
they proved minimal
trouble for IC, who (very
nervously) beat them in
straight games to the
cheering of the rest of the
IC Team.
Then it was the turn of
IC's end pair consisting of
Julie Goodeve and Susan
Yates to play Leed's 2nd
pair. Much to the relief of
all the IC team they won
with style, giving IC a 2-0
lead.
Inspired by the previous
2 games, IC's 3rd pair of
Helen Gregory and Farida
Kateli went out against
Leeds 3rd pair and
annihilated them with ease
to give IC a 3-0 lead,
looking extremely
promising.
Our first pair of Robin
and Sarah then continued
their winning streak to win
their next two games. The
second pair beat the third
pair but decided that they'd
better let the Leeds 1st pair
win. The third pair
surpassed themseles in
beating the Leed's 2nd pair,
but were unable to beat the
first pair.
These results gave IC an
incredible 7-2 win over
Leeds University to take
them into the finals the
following day against
Loughborough who beat
Birmingham 5-4.
Determined not to be
overawed by
Loughborough's reputation
or their supporters, IC went
out ready to do battle.
Unfortunately, a shock
result occured in the very
first game when
Loughborough had an
unprecedented win over
our 1st pair, which
somewhat shook our
winning strategy.
Realising that the pressure
was now on them to win,
the 2nd pair went out, to
try and do justice to a
wonderful IC ladies team.
After narrowly losing the
first game 15-11, they
fought back to the take the
second 15-9. With
everybody nervously
watching and praying for
an IC victory, they
struggled at the beginning
of the third game and were
8-3 down at the change of
ends. Despite a desperate
effort to rethink their
tactics and come out on
top, they were unable to
beat Loughborough and
rather sadly lost 15-5, thus
almost sealing the fate of
the match.
From that point, all our
pains managed to beat an
extremely weak third pair
from Loughborough, but
although our first pair beat
the Loughborough second
pair, our second pair lost to
Loughborough's first as
did our third, and this left
he score at 4-4 with one
game left to play our third
pair against Loughboough's
second pair.
Our third pair put up a
tremendous fight, but
unfortunatley for IC were
unable to overcome the
strength of Loughborough
and lost, thus giving a final
score of a 5-4 win for
Loughborough.
