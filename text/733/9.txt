review*
There are few things as
depressing as seeing
talented people wasted on
material that isn't worthy of
them and few things as
unamusing as a funny film
that isn't funny. Car
Trouble is unfortunately
both of these things. It
concerns a childish couple
and how the man's passion
for fast cars, and in
particular an E-type Jaguar,
affects their relationship.
He, Ian Charleston, is a
flight controller and she,
Julie Walters, is a bored
housewife; both of them
are selfish and petty. In
spite of the efforts of both
these talented people and
the excellent Vincenzo
Ricotta as the car
salesman, the film fails
because of it's dated
nudge-nudge, wink-wink
humour and the lack of
ideas to fill a feature film.
There are some
genuinely funny moments,
often involving the symbol
of the lower middle class
aspirations, the garden
gnome, but equally there
are some jokes that are
very wide of the mark, such
as the film-buff reference to
'The Shining' and the
attempt by Ian Charleston
to murder his wife by
arranging a mid-air
collision The film is also
spoilt by some over-zealous,
editing and some intrusive
music. The final line sums
up the main characters:
'You're a maniac, and so's
that woman, you deserve
each other'.
A small German film
which I was very impressed
with when I saw it last year
has finally been released in
this country. I think that it
is well worth a visit. The
idea behind Out of Order is
a very simple one, but the
skill is in the telling.
On a Friday evening four
employees get into a lift in
order to leave for the
weekend. The lift then gets
stuck. The elderly man
clings to his briefcase and
the young messenger, Pit,
and the slightly past-it
executive, Jdrg begin to
compete for the arttractive
advertising woman, Marion.
Almost the entire film
takes place in the confines
of the lift, but both the
control of space and the
tension in the relationships
is skillfully directed by Carl
Schenkel. The
claustrophobia of the lift
interior enhances the
feeling of depth when the
lift shaft is shown in several
very tense escape attempts.
Although an apparently
predictable story there are
some clever twists and
some exciting action
scenes. I was riverted for
most of the film.

Less than Zero appears to
be one of the books of the
moment. Hailed by
reviewers as a modern
'Catcher in the Rye' and
selling millions in the
States, it seems set to
combine pulp sensation
with depressing social
commentary. Less Than
Zero is a description of the
lifestyle of the children of
the decadent rich in Los
Angeles.
I suspect this will be the
sort of book people either
love or loathe which leaves
one in a sort of desolate
middle ground when trying
to review it. The writing has
a curious but striking style
which uses the present
tense in a rather chain-of-
thought manner. The story,
if that is the right word,
describes the central
character's experiences
during a month's holiday
back home from college in
the East. The world of rich
adolescents in Los Angeles
portrayed as a mindless
chain of parties and
cruising chic bars and
clubs in flashy cars. The
characters, trapped in a
sort of emotionless hell, are
shown seeking kicks in
drugs and snuff movies
whiles their parents live in
some separate uncaring
world. Clay's 13 year old
sister boasts to him in front
of their mother that they
don't need to steal his
cocaine as they have their
own supplier, while later he
finds one of his friends has
been forced into
homosexual prostitution to
pay off drug debts.
Whether less than Zero is
meant as a profound
commentary on the moral
corruption of excessive
wealth or whether it is
meant as an excuse for the
decadent to demand
sympathy I'm not sure,
thats up to you. Can you
have sympathy for coked
out characters without the
will even to think beyond
the next expensive thrill?
Clay finally draws the line
at faking part in the gang
rape of a 12 year-old, but
while he begins to distance
himself from his family and
friends the book leaves the
impression of a teenage
population with nowhere to
go but down.
The Year of the Quiet
Sun deserves a longer
treatment than I have space
to give it here, so I'll
reiterate the important
point, it's excellent.
Polish settlers are trying
to recreate their lives in
war-torn Europe in an area
that is now Western
Poland, but was previously
Germany. Against this
background a shy
American volunteers for a
driving job because he is
too shattered to return
home. Soon he meets a
widow and they fall for
each other.
They unfortunately have
no common language and
their clumsy attempts to
communicate both intimate
comments and escape
distrust that heralds the
Cold War. The whole film is
delightful and the finale
dream sequence genuinely
moving, a sad but
heartwarming experience.
And finally Mr Love,
another sweet little film
from Goldcrest. This one
tells the tale of Mr Lovelace
a Southport gardner. At
nearly fifty after 28 years of
marriage,he decides he needs
some love and in a gently
beguiling way charms the
local womenfolk before his
untimely death
(prophetically referred to
by one of his affairs in a
comment about her
passion, spiders).
Although lacking some of
the wit of some of Puttman's
\ k M O ? Nic-
plans have to be done
through an inappropriate

provides much of the
frustration and poignancy
of the film whilst at the
same time reflecting the
