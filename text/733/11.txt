The thirds gained revenge
over the seconds for their
win earlier in the season
with their first league win
since November. Both
teams played with 3
'ringers', Paul Bravery,
Dave Lynne and Lawrence
Covill for the thirds,
Lawrence playing his first
game back from an 8 week
suspension for telling
Bravery to F * * k off.
Covin's dominance of the
back four enabled Dave
Martin to keep a clean
sheet for the first time this
season, having only one
save of note from a 25 yard
drive from Goldsworthy.
At half-time it was still 0-
0, the best chance of the
half falling to Andy Wright
when Curtis Davies ran
through the defence and
chipped the keeper for
Wright to just head down at
his feet instead of into the
empty net. A brilliant
tactical move by Captain
Martin Lake saw the team
revert to 4-4-2 for the
second period. This was
showing signs of working
well and Captain Lake
decided it was time to call
on his last trump card to
save the 3rds from
relegation. Off went Dave
Semerion who had played
on despite being ill at the
start and on came
supersub, Psycho John
Galloway.
With about 15 minutes to
i go a searching run from
. Dave Lynne followed by a
I cutting pass left John in
j front of an empty net.
I Instead of just tapping the
:
ball in he stopped, calmy
put his foot on the ball,
teed up and waited for the
keeper to dive before
scoring off the post.

IC Head of Burway
Whilst the 1st VIII trained
on the Tidenway in
preparation for the Head,
the remainder of the Men's
Top Squad and the Men's
novices went to Burway
Head.
In the four't, ovent IC had
two crews entered. The
novice coxed four starting
tenth just ahead of the
Staines Senior A coxed
four were unlucky. The
experienced Staines crew
quickly caught the novice
four and clashed blades.
The Staines crew then cut
across the bows of the
novice crew and holed the
bow spraydeck. This
bought both crews to a
standstill. The marshalls
decided to disqualify both
crews-this seemed
exceptionally harsh on the
novice crew. Despite the
stoppage they completed
the course in the second
fastest time of their
division. The determination
and power of this crew
(Steve Wright, Charlie
Marsden, Dominic
Strowbridge and Andrews
Renwick) should bring
them several wins this
season.
The Elite coxless four
which consisted of the
remaining top group had
an extraordinary day. The
intended bow man Robert
Gee had been 'eliminated'
after being hospitalised for
a day after an incident on
the river the prevoius
Wednesday. This
necessitated the steering to
be moved to two-in the

capable hands of Bill
Mason. With Hans Michels
at three feeling the effects
of flu, and Uave Morten at
stroke making an unfit
comeback, the crew was
lucky that Nigel Reynolds
slotted in so well in the
bow seat. The crew went
off second and made up
the 22 second margin to
the Staines crew ahead well
before the half distance
mark. Staines refused to let
IC through on the inside,
and forced IC and 'Buffalo
Bill' round the outside of
the bend where they were
rowing in the stream. At the
finish the crews finished
level. A long recovery was
needed before returning to
the landing stage. The Elite
four had done enough to
win overall and give Bill
Mason an Elite win for the
Twentieth consecutive year.
The Senior B VIII then
took to the water. In a Very
impressive performance in
which they had greater
cohesion and aggression,
they took apart the Staines
Senior A eight. Once past
this Staines crew and back
on the inside of the bend,
Nigel Reynolds backed up
by John Harnett took the
rate up one, the remainder
of the crew Chas Behrens,
Dave 'Dredger' Hudson,
Clive Travis, James 'Spag-
Bol' Ganderton, Vince
'Black Adder' Roper and
Paul 'Pecker' Richards
responded. By the finish
they had pulled out another
six lengths on Staines.
Being forced around the
outside of the bend over
the first half had cost
valuable time and they lost
their division by three
seconds.

Ladies Hockey, always
keen for a challenge played
'Ice Hockey' this Saturday
in the semi-final of the
Ladies plate competiton.
Despite very difficult
playing conditions due to
the rock solid pitch, IC
completely outplayed their
opposition, Q M C 2. The
first goal was quite
spectacular, and was
scored from a short corner
by our star player Sarah
Hodgson. The second goal
was also excellent, scored
by Elaine Harper. There
was some doubt as to
whether a short corner
should have been awarded
instead of a goal, but our
umpire was obviously
suitably bribed! (His name
is Jonathan Stonham-he
wanted his name
mentioned!) The game
ended with no more goals,
so we are now through to
the final of the plate. As yet
we don't know who the
opposition is as the
previous round match has
not been played, but
whoever it is we're
confident!

College Mixed 6
The Imperial team was
really up against it in this
mixed doubles friendly, as
Richmond were fielding
two players who have
played intercollegiate
tennis for their Universities
in the states. This however
did not deter Michael
Morcos and Becky Hunt
from both giving splendid
performances winning one
of their matches and
stealing a set in another.
Unfortunately the same
could not be said for the
other doubles pairing of
Steve Cain and Sabina
Coshlich who went down ini
straight rather rapid sets in
both matches.
On Sunday the snow
blizzard caused the IC
mens 1st VI match at
Queens club to be
abandoned just before it
began, much to Queens
relief who live to fight again
another day.
