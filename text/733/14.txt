Spin-offs are a great part of
any endeavour. The Apollo
project gave us the Teflon
non-stick lavatory seat,
until complaints about
serious spinal injuries, from
people who kept on falling
off, ditched this idea. Not
discouraged, the inventors
returned with the far more
useful non-stick frying pan.
A later project with Teflon
ball-pens also proved to be
ill-advised: the sight of
people chasing round
offices after runaway pens
was deemed to be a major
cause of stress and deaths
among yuppies. So
ergonomics experts ruled
that the pens were unfit for
use.
Similarly, research into
oil-drilling has bequeathed
reusable chewing gum unto
the human race. Originally
intended for sticking plates
to tables in rough seas, it
has found a use among
encyclopaedia salesmen to
prevent their jaws from
seizing-up on long journeys
between victims. The
saleman has evolved a jaw
capable of prolonged
enthusing over pictures of
gerbil-eating pygmy tribes
from the wilds of Guildford.
However this highly
specialised mechanism
requires constant exercise,
and before the advent of
this miracle invention
salesmen had been found
between houses with totally
locked faces, unable to
speak. Now the same piece
of gum can keep one going
for over a year. It is
available in three enticing
flavours: Sawdust, Dead
Lemming and Halitosis.
With his absence from
the media for more than
two hours, rumours may
have had it that Paul
Weller's own jaw has seized
up. But he's back with Turn
Robinson and a cast of
thousands, just around the
corner at the Albert Hall on
Sunday. It's part of GLC's
Jobs Year campaign, now
entering its second year. It
may not be long before it
becomes the G L C Jobs
Decade. The show itself
begins at 6:15pm and costs
a mere £3.50 to get in.
Later the same evening,
Geno Washington is
playing in that nightclub
beloved by intercollegiate
halls, Xenon. It starts at
9pm, but this one is worth
an entire blue note.
On Thursday, at the
increasingly expensive
Town and Country Club
are the 'light as Angel
Delight' group, the Bangles,
currently known for their
frothy hit, 'Manic Monday'.
Decent gigs seems to be
like buses this week, not so
much one every one-and-a-
half days, as two every
three days; since also on
Thursday, the Pale
Fountains play Bay 63 for
the knockdown prices of £3
and £2.50. Guesting with
the Paleys, who have long
outgrown their turgid
debut, Thank-you', having
produced two fine albums,
are promising band, the
Servants. They are living
proof that the jingle-jangle
guitar revival ploughs
relentlessly on. Just as long
as no-one starts break-
dancing to it...
The Tate Gallery now
gets a chance to recycle
the various paintings from
its existing modern
collection until April 27th.
'Forty Years'Of Modern Art
(1945-1985)' purports to
take in everything from
Vorticism to Kinetic Art,
and may be worth a visit
just in. case they have dug
out something that hasn't
been displayed for a few
years. I suspect that like
many Tate retrospectives,
the exhibition is too small
to be truly representative.
Meanwhile at the
Hanging Gardens of
Barbican opens a new
exhibition entitled "Art and
Time" — looking at various
artists' concepts of the
passage of time.
Unfortunately the
distinguished crowd
selected appear to have
come up with a depressing
number of pictures of
clocks. Admittedly the
timepieces in Dali's oeuvres
do look as though were
caught too close to a
tactical nuclear weapon.
Still not quite sure why the
fish is there though...
A new method of training
for the 400m dash in the
UAU competitions is the
eat-at-Pizzaland-then-run-
out-of-the-door-without-
paying technique. However
this really doesn't work
very well at "Just Around
The Corner" (Finchley
Road) — since you can
decide if you pay and, if so,
how much. The main catch
is they decide what you are
going to eat, and in what
order the courses come.
Conciencc generally gets
the better of people here,
and they all dutifully cough
up. But if you really feel
like being a bastard...
Stuck for something to
do on a Thursday? Glue-
sniffing no longer gives you
a kick? Why not come
along to the FELIX social
evening on a Thursday?
You can sample the
delights of inhaling ink and
other noxious solvents, and
discover a new aid to
Transcendental Meditation
simply by inserting pieces
of folded paper into other
pieces of folded paper. You
even get to meet some of
the wierdest people at IC,
and all in the same room. It
starts at 7pm and ends
eventually.
Thus spake Zarathrustra:
"I'm buggered if they're
going to use my theme for
some crappy SF film".
