ICSO
What's loud, dramatic,
intense, ecstatic, takes over
an hour to perform and
requires everything that
more than two hundred
performers can give it?
MAHLER'S
R E S U R R E C T I O N
SYMPHONY!
If you think that
symphonies are the
harmless, rather tuneful
outpourings of some
slightly eccentric, grey-
haired composer who died
near Bavaria three hundred
years ago, F O R G E T IT!
There's nothing Sunday-
afternoon-tea-roomy about
this work (after all, could
you honestly expect seven
trombones, twelve trumpets
and sixteen horns to
behave themselves for an
hour? And there's no telling
what the O F F - S T A G E
bands are getting up to...).
The sheer size of the
orchestral forces involved
indicate that this symphony
is on an epic scale (as were
most of Mahler's works),
and it is partly for this
reason that it is seldom
performed. Aside from the
indulgences in the brass
section, the woodwind are
doubled, the strings seem
to spread to the walls of
the Great Hall, and the
Percussion!—Can such a
collection of cymbals,
drums and two sets of
Timpani be contained?
As if this wasn't enough
to communicate with,
Mahler adds a soprano and
alto solist, backed up by a
large choir, just so no one
fails to notice the fourth
and fifth movements.
Who, you may well be
asking, is going to perform
such an unbelievably
extravagant and demanding
piece anywhere, let alone
at IC?
Imperial College
Symphony Orchestra,
under the flamboyant
direction of Mr Richard
Dickins, their principal
conductor. This is the
group who brought you
Rachmaninov's 2nd
Symphony last term,
Schostokavich's 5th
Symphony and, last year,
Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring'.
ICSO has about seventy
members who meet every
Wednesday for a gruelling
three-hour session, loosely
known as 'a rehearsal. The
Orchestra's recent
achievements testify to the
high standard of playing
and the enthusiasm with
which the players tackle
ever-more preposterous
programmes, proposed by
their conductor.
Mr Richard Dickins has
been ' in charge' of ICSO
for seven years. He studied
clarinet at the Royal
College of Music (next
door), changing to
conducting, which he
began with Norman Del
Mar. Since he left the
College in 1979, Richard
has kept a busy schedule,
somehow managing to fit
ICSO rehearsals between
directing the Covent
Garden Chamber Orchestra
and the Minehead Festival,
Richard Dickins
appearing at Edinburgh
Festival and Sadler's Wells,
and flitting across to La
Scala, Milan. But his most
important appointment (at
least to us) is that he is
now 'musician in
residence'. He even has an
office! Any musicians or
interested students may
find him on Wednesday
afternoons in 322, 53
Prince's Gate.
That's enough about
Richard, except to say that
he's pretty animated and
should be even more
dynamic than usual for this
one!
Although the majority of
the Symphony is purely
orchestral, the short fourth
movement and the epic
finale use solo voices and
choir. Our soprano soloist
is Melanie Armitstead. She
studied singing at the
Guildhall School of Music
after graduating from
Durham with Russian and
French. Since then, she has'
worked with many
emminent musicians
including Sir Peter Pears,
and has spent several
summers at the Britten-
Pears school for Advanced
Musical study. Melanie has
given recitals and
performed in Oratories
throughout the country,
and was a finalist in the
1984 'S-Hertogenbosch
.Melanie Armitstead
International Singing
Competition.
Yvonne Howard is the
alto soloist. She was
awarded many prizes at the
Royal Northern College of
Music, and has done
masterclasses with Helen
Watts and Elizabeth
Schwarzkopf. As well as a
soloist with orchestras and
choirs, Yvonne has also
given acclaimed
performances on te
operatic stage, singing
Marcellina in Mozart's
Marriage of Figaro' with
Glyndebourne Touring
Opera in 1984.
The choral forces are
provided by IC Choir, who
have undertaken to sing
with ICSO as well as
perform their own concert
(coming soon!). Their
enthusiastic performances
are well known,
encouraged by their
conductor, Prof Eric
Brown.
So, there you have it: all
the ingredients for a
completely exhilerating and
totally shattering
experience. It's a great
opportunity to hear some
of Mahler in his most
expansive and dramatic
state—not to be missed
under any circumstances!
And it's tonight, Friday
28th February, at 8pm in
the Great Hall. Students get
in for £1.50. But dont be
late-it's a long wait till the
end of the first movement!
Wine and refreshments will
be available after the
concert for those who
survive the performance.
See you there!
