Underwater
Diving
On Friday February 21, 10
keen divers showing
masochistic tendencies, left
Beit Quad to bravely
explore where no sane
person would ever
contemplate going in
February.
Saturday morning saw us
trying to unstiffen the
resulting frozen joints and
making our way to
Porthkerris where the Navy
kindly gave us the
opportunity to be targets
for their Stingray
torpedoes. Sadly we were
unable to participate and
so moved on to
Porthousetock where 3
screaming novices (Dave,
Jim and Jason) were
deposited in the icy
Atlantic for 30 minutes (the
coldness of which was only
surpassed by the 'hot'
showers at the youth
hostel). It was here that
one teamster decided to
lick clean the underside of
the boat while it was still in
the water. He ws
accordingly given the 'Dick
of the day award' (yet
again.)
By the afternoon we had
transported ourselves to
RCSU
First of all here's a
reminder that voting in the
present R C S U elections
takes place on Monday in
all departments so turn up
and register your opinion
even if it's just to abstain.
The results will be
announced at the U G M on
Tuesday 4 March, 1pm in
the Union Dining Hall, 1st
Floor Beit Building. Then
there's the Results Barnight
that evening in the Union
Bar.
Many thanks to the 180
of you who have signed up
for donating blood and I
must apologize for the
interminable delay.
Unfortunately the
Transfusion Service have
only just come to inspect
our facilities and are now
saying that they won't be
able to come into college
until the first week of next
term. If this turns out to be
the case, a list of all who
signed will be put on R C S
notice boards for you to
indicate whether you'd be
willing to donate then.

DOWN HIGH S T R E E T
KENSINGTON in aid of
S H E L T E R (Homeless
People) takes place on
Saturday. Meet 11.30 for
12.00 in the R C S U (and
dress sensibly).
Mullion Cove where the
more experienced divers'
enthusiasm for the pub was
thwarted by the novices.
With the exception of Andy
and Julie (Wimps) we spent
about twenty minutes being
thrashed about by the swell
in and round the harbour
and we didn't even catch a
single crab!!(Watch out for
the T shirts). By this time it
had started snowing which
caused some rapid
changing, blue extremities
and a fairly interesting use
of language.
We awoke Sunday
morning, but only just, to
find a blanket of snow all
around and the rough sea
conditions prohibited
diving. Reluctantly we
loaded the van and minibus
and began to wind our
wary way through many
snowdrifts, with Nick finally
fulfiling his ambition to
steer a bobsleigh. Many
thanks to Nick, Jim, Andy
and Chris for driving the
vehicles.
And to think we do all
this for fun!!
Cycling
There'll be no club ride
next Sunday since we're all
going to Essex for a time-
trial. The next team time-
trial will be either 22nd or
23rd March. Please turn up
on Thursday to enter (this
one's a 4 up).
Since you're reading this
article, you must be
interested in cycling, so
turn up on Wednesday to
stretch your legs! (2pm Beit
Arch.)
Rugby Sevens
Due to bad weather the
Guilds Rugby Sevens has
been postponed until
Sunday 9 March. This
means that there is still
time to get a team together.
The standard rules for
Rugby Sevens apply, with
one exception: the teams
(of seven players and one
reserve) can include only
one guest (ie not a
Guildsman).
For further details get in
touch with S Maycock of
Mech Eng 3.
Don't miss out on this
chance for a really great
game of social rugby (and
a chance to see the Guilds
Exec and FELIX teams
make complete fools of
themselves).
Coaches for teams and
supporters will leave
college, for Harlington, at
11am.
Team captains should
enter on the list just inside
the Guilds Office, on Levei
three, Mech Eng.
Dramsoc
A few quick notes before I
pander to the worst aspects
of the Clubs page, but if
everybody else does it why
shouldn't I? Blame for this
crap may be attributed to
QT or SF Soc — who are
both thankfully absent this
week.
Yes, it's the week before
Kennedy's Children.
Tickets are on sale now for
this entirely new style of
venture for Dramsoc — an
unmissable experience. The
show is on 12—15 March.
Now to the nitty gritty: If,
however, we quantify the
problem by assigning to a
front-loader a "coefficient
of cburned-up-ness", C, of
1.0 it is questionable if even
the most advanced vertical
axis machines can obtain a
value of greater than 0.6.
It is in the spinning
department, though that
the front loader machine is
undoubtedly superior.
Whereas the top loader
ruthlessly splatters washing
against the inside of the
H r u m a front InaHor fnllowc
Chess
Last weekend the London
University Individual
Closed Chess
championship was held at
Imperial with a strong
representation from IC
Chess Club. The entry this
year was particularly good
with 17 people in all plus
the indomitable Mike
Gornedi (Age 40 plus),
eternal student, who seems
to have run out of
authorities to give him a
grant.
The four round
tournament proved quite
lively, especially in the
second round when Paul
Windle (IC) was stalemated
by his opponent in time
trouble when he only had a
king, and his opponent
King, Queen, Bishop and a
couple of pawns.
The event was finally
won jointly by Paul Windel
(IC) and S Nicholls (Kings)
both with (31/2/4).
Newcomer John D'Sonta
(IC) was awarded the
highest ungraded player
prize with (2y2/4). T h e
other IC placings were; M
Shewan (2y2 /4). V
Chinegwundoh (2/4) A
Bowles (1/4), A Badiani
(1/4)
IC Chess Teams still
have a few games left this
season so if you are
interested in playing please
come up to the Chess Club
any dinner time as soon as
possible.
