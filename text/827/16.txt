Henry V
The Wars of the Roses : Episode 4.
Y o u n g Prince H a l , likely l a d ,
reveller, drinker of sack, is king. He
has revoked his past, transformed
to adulthood and decided to claim
France as h i s o w n , o n the
consultation of the Archbishop of
Canterbury.
The French are informed, but take
the threat lightly. Henry assembles
his armies, deals with a few rebels
at Southampton, and sets sail for the
continent. Amongst the soldiers are
Pistol, Bardolph and N y m , o l d
friends from the Boar's H e a d
Tavern, and sources of humour and
lessons in morality.
The town of Harfleur is taken and
the Battle of Agincourt commences.
Henry's army is outnumbered 5 to
1 yet sustains only thirty losses
compared to 10,000 French deaths.
With the battle lost the French King
Charles V I surrenders to Henry's
terms. Marriage is proposed to
Katherine, Charles' daughter, w h o
accepts.
In order that this simple historical
story becomes a n entertaining
production, the Bard has created a
rousing tale of fervent nationalism,
brotherhood a n d glory. Director
Michael Bogdanov has extended
this to bolster a patriotism which
w o u l d shame Oliver North a n d
could concievably knock several
points of the Eurotunnel shares.
The production is slick, the sets
m i n i m a l i s t a n d effective, the
changes smooth. The ambiguous
and anachronistic setting of the
piece, n o w the n o r m i n
S h a k e s p e a r i a n theatre, is a
crossbreed of Victorian England and
World War II.
The underlying theme of this
staging remains its contrasting view
of opposing states. In battle the King
inspires his troops, ' G o d save
Harry,England, and St.George !'
They respond as only the English
can - the sailing from Southampton
is a scene of riotous marching
skinheads, with a chant of 'Here we
go' and a banner proclaiming 'Fuck
the Frogs'.
The placid, casual and aloof air of
the e n e m y is m a i n t a i n e d
throughout, with the exception of
the Dauphin's character, a militant
a n d w a r h u n g r y i n d i v i d u a l ,
humorous in his disposition, both
to the audience and his peers.
The standard of acting is very
high. Many of the players cope with
difficult text a n d d e m a n d i n g
regional accents. Three people stand
out though: Sion Probert, as the
officer Lluellen, puts such strength
and conviction into his part as to
leave an impression that the Welsh
are unparalleled in patriotism. A n d
who would disagree?
The D a u p h i n , performed b y
Andrew Jarvis, has a madness and
volatility, and not least a funny
walk, which convinced me that he
wasn't acting at all. I look toward to
seeing him as Richard III next week.
John Dougall, in the guise of the
king, ensures that the central
character is never superceded. In
each scene he appears, full attention
remains on his every movement or
word. Dougall draws the audience
in and refuses to release them.
This production has to be highly
recommended to all, and must
surely be strong competition for
similar compilation at the Barbican.
The O l d Vic is very pretty, and the
ice-cream excellent, if expensive. In
a word faultless.

The Dead
Can't Lie
When I went into this film, I
assumed it would be some kind of
Mafia, underworld type thriller.
This theory was confirmed by the
appearance of a 'Film Noir' type
private investigator called Mallard
(possible rip-off of Marlow). M r
Mallard is lured to find some jewels
of suspect origin by an affluent
client.
At this point the attractive female
co-star turns up. The usual happens
between her and Mr.Mallard, it
turns out that she is also after the
jewels. This is complicated by the
fact that despite appearances, she is
in fact dead.
This poses some interesting
questions. What possible use does
a corpse have for 1 million dollars
of jewellery? What is the legal
position of someone guilty of
unpremeditated necrophilia? What
am I doing i n this cinema?
A n y w a y the plot trundles along
w i t h the occasional 'shock
revelations' you have anticipated for
at least 30 minutes. This is basically
a story of t w o - d i m e n s i o n a l
characters involved i n a plot of
contradictions such as the fact that
going to bed with a ghost is a fatal
experience (even with a condom)
yet M a l l a r d looks remarkably
healthy at the end. Basically a film
that spends far too long getting
going and by the time something
does, you wish it hadn't bothered.

Slipstream
Its a few years since Mark Hamill
last took to the screen, not since
Return of the Jedi in fact. The long
break and a radically different part
allows him to break the typecasting
which Luke Skywalker invoked, but
unfortunately this film proves little
more than a springboard to re-
launch his career.
Hamill plays Tasker, a hardened
cop with a n itchy trigger finger,
intent on bringing a murderer in for
trial and execution. His success will
lead to a healthy reward and a ticket
to easier life 'downstream'.
B y r o n is the murderer, a
conservative looking character in a
pinstripe suit blessed with an
expansive knowledge of history,
literature and philosophy. He is an
intriguing and confusing person,
until it is revealed that he isn't a
person at all. H e is instead an
intriguing and confusing android.
While in Tasker's custody, Byron
is kidnapped by Matt Owens, a
smuggler with J.R.Ewing accent and
Michael Hutchence (of INXS) looks.
O w e n s c a n see the financial
advantages of reaching the
settlement with his captive and
takes to the air.
The chase is o n , through a
wilderness world of canyons and
ravines, the result of Mother Earth's
revolt against pollution. A s the
characters progress they encounter
a diverse assortment of guest stars
- Robbie Coltrane, Ben Kingsley,
F.Murray Abraham - w h o die
somewhat needlessly and generally
at Tasker's bidding.
The entire affair is pretty lack-
lustre, a n d seemingly pointless.
Byron a n d Matt have a short
exchange at the close concerning the
dangers of humanity, but this is the
only insight into an otherwise
inaccessible lesson. Despite
advertising which made this film
look appealing and a leading female
who is, you must surely have better
things to do with your time.
