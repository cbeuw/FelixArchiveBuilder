Jazzy Blues
Chris Barber's Jazz & Blues Band,
100 Club, Wednesday 25 Jan.
Trombonist, vocalist, bandleader,
record producer, jazz fanatic—the
list is impressive in itself, but Chris
Barber has been all of these things
for 35 years. Since the 1950s when
he helped found the legendary
Marquee Club, then in Oxford
Street, h i s band of dedicated
musicians has toured the world and
recorded a broad range of musical
styles with a plethora of great
musicians. It was he who first
brought legendary blues giants such
as H o w l i n ' Wolf to Britain from
America and his weekly sessions at
the Marquee launched the R & B
craze in the 1950s.
At lot has happened in the years
since, but Barbers Jazz and Blues
Band is still a group of dedicated
musicians surviving it's personnel
changes through the years. Their
return to the 100 Club was an
impressive show of traditional jazz,
swing and mellow blues; rough yet
clean, original foot stomping music
delivered w i t h a n enthusiasm
disguising their years. A t home
playing slow blues or shouting,
powerful jazz, all eight blend their
instruments together without losing
their individuality. Pat Halcox's
muted trumpet on Spanish Castles,
the inspired double bass of Vic Pitt
as he launches into a blinding solo,
or the almost be-bop tenor
saxophone with which John Crocker
beautifully slides in and out of the
melodies, all were worthy of the
capacity crowd that night. Their
success is undoubtedly the product
of a passion for jazz shared by two
friends who wanted to start a band
35 years ago. Their band is still
going strong, and they still love
jazz, but best of all, they are still
playing it.

Jesus Jones
Jesus Jones have not been around
long. Y o u can tell this by the fact
that they still have Joe T know the
band mate' Bloggs turning up to
their gigs. He is the one who subtely
lets you know his aquaintaince with
the group by shouting 'Barry is a
wanker' then laughing (laaarfing) in
a South London accent. The band
are visibly embarrassed by this
remnant of their schooldays and
attempt to pass him off as a heckler.
Joe will not be defeated though, he
continues to yodel the names of
songs then go 'Yeah' as they start
the introduction and nod his head
vigorously whilst all around him are
static. One day the band will tell him
to piss off, then they will have
matured.
Jesus Jones try to shock, with
attitude rather than antics.
Proclaiming their o w n greatness,
strutting, posing then playing listen-
to-us pop rock a la Wonderstuff. They
are the best of the Pop Will Eat Itself-
Wonderstuff apostles. They play this
arrogant music right and believe in
what they say. They make you
believe it, you feel that there must
be something in them, they are a
spectacle to be seen.
Jesus Jones are playing ICU on March
3, come along with your leather jacket.

The two prime movers in Mozart's
creativity reflect the two greatest
things in life; love and death. In his
operas the most m o v i n g a n d
genuine passages deal with these
wonderful ideas which are the
renewal of life, and an end to life.
Mozart w a s an attentive a n d
affectionate lover as can be seen
from h i s letters to h i s wife
Constanze. Seven years into their
marriage, while he was away i n
Dresden, he wrote
'Dearest little wife, if only I had
a letter from you! If I were to tell you
all the things I do with your dear
portrait I think you would often
laugh. For instance, when I take it
out of its case, I say, 'Good-day,
Stanzerl! Good-day, little rascal,
pussy-pussy, little turned-up nose,
little bagatelle, Schluck und Druck',
and when I put it away again, I let
it slip in very slowly, saying all the
time, ' N u - N u - N u - N u ! ' with the
peculiar emphasis which this word
so full of meaning demands, and
then just at the last, quickly, ' G o o d
night, little mouse, sleep well.' Well,
I suppose I have been writing
something very foolish (to the world
at all events); but to us who love
each other so dearly, it is not foolish
at all. Today is the sixth day since
1 left you and by Heaven! it seems
a year.'
His operas are full of complex
love-affairs which usually e n d
happily, such as those in his most
famous opera Le Nozze di Figaro.
The plot is rather light, but caused
a stir among the aristocracy of the
time because it showed the servants
of the household plotting against,
and making a fool of, their masters.
We start with Figaro, man-servant
of the Count Almaviva, calling out
the measurements for the room
which is to contain his wedding-
bed. H i s fiancee, the scrunty
Susanna, tells him that the Count
has designs on her. The countess is
e n a m o u r e d of a y o u n g a n d
handsome page called Cherubino
who spends a great deal of time
hiding in cupboards and climbing
out of back windows. Figaro is loved
by a crinkly old woman, Marcellina,
who is old enough to be his mother,
and who actually turns out to be his
mother. The complexity reaches its
height w h e n the C o u n t asks
Susanna to do something that a
fiancee really should not, but she
dupes h i m by swapping dresses
with the countess so that the Count
commits adultery with his o w n
wife. To save face he declares his
love for her and everyone sings a
happy chorus.
Mozart's character also had a
deeper and more serious side. This
can be seen in a letter he wrote to
his father Leopold, whom he loved
greatly, on hearing of his illness.
'...but now I hear that you are
really ill. I need hardly tell you how
greatly I am longing to receive some
reassuring news from yourself. A n d
I still expect it; although I have now
made a habit of being prepared in
all affairs of life for the worst. A s
death, when we come to consider it
closely, is the true goal of our
existence, I have formed during the
la*! few years such close relations
with this best and truest friend of
mankind, that his image is not only
no longer terrifying to me, but is
indeed very soothing and consoling.
And I thank my G o d for graciously
granting me the opportunity (you
know what I mean) of learning that
death is the K E Y which unlocks the
door to our true happiness.'
Old Motzie himself
His masterpiece, the Requiem,
was commissioned by a 'stranger in
grey'. He became convinced that he
had been poisoned with acqua
toffana, a designer poison of the
seventeenth century, as his wife
described after his death
'Some six months before his death
he was possessed with the idea of
his being poisoned - T know I must
die,' he exclaimed, 'someone has
given me acqua toffana and has
calculated the precise time of my
death—for which they have ordered
a Requiem, it is for myself that I am
writing this.'
His wife forced him to put it aside,
and so he wrote a masonic ode
which was a great success. This
gave him confidence to return to the
Requiem, but within a few days of
starting he fell ill and died a few
months later. To the last he worked
on the Requiem, dictating to his
pupil Sussmayr, and telling h i m
how to complete the work. A
woman at his bedside wrote 'his last
movement was an attempt to
express with his mouth the drum
passages in the Requiem. That I can
still hear.'

420-2.
