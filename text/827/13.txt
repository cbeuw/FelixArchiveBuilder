Poll Tax:the truth
The Poll Tax or Community Charge
will take effect i n Scotland from the
beginning of April, and the rest of
us will get it the following April. To
the average member of the public it
will mean a bill of £200-£300, and to
students £50-£100 per year. The Poll
Tax will take over from the present
rating system whereby local councils
generate income by charging people
according to the rateable value of
their houses. Everyone (apart from
the mentally ill, elderly people living
i n homes a n d hospitals, a n d
convicted prisoners) even foreign
residents will have to pay. Students
will be entitled to a 80% reduction
if they register at their College
address. Estimates of the charge/tax
vary horn borough to borough, with
central London generally having the
highest levels (see table).
Westminster Borough (which covers
Southside and many intercollegiate
halls) would have charged £448 had
this been the first year of the Poll
Tax. Thus 20% of £448 = 89.60. It
is still possible for students to
register at home; however, it seems
that then you would have to pay the
full amount, not a clever idea. This
does not refer to registering to vote
at home and at College which is still
possible.
Local councils will send out
registration forms i n the autumn
which must be returned. There is a
fine of 10% of the bill for non-return.
This process h a s occurred i n
Scotland, where the Minister for
Scotland, Malcolm Rifkin, claimed
that 99% of those eligible to pay had
registered. Campaigns for non-
return had been organised by the
Scottish Nationalist Party, several
rebel Labour M P s and some clergy.
The response of the Labour Party to
the Poll Tax featured heavily in the
Glasgow G o r a n by-election, i n
which the S N P w o n with a large
turn around i n the Labour vote.
Scotland became a testing ground as
the Tories feared devastation at the
polls after revaluation increased
rates by u p to 300% under the old
system.
Non-payment of the tax will
involve a surcharge of £50 o n top of
the bill. There are claims that many
councils will be unable to collect all
the Poll Tax due to it because of the
difficulties involved with keeping
track of people. Under the present
system, which has a high collection
rate, thanks largely to the fact that
houses, unlike people hardly move,
m a n y boroughs achieve 9 8 %
registering. However Birmingham
City Council estimated in the last
year of its existence that they
collected just 81%.
The contention behind the Poll
Tax has a long history, first
appearing in 1377 as a tax of a Groat
per head on people over the age of
16. The tax was increased but as a
sliding scale i n 1379 peasants still
paid one grout. Then the Parliament
of Christmas 1380 imposed a Poll
Tax of one shilling o n peasants
rising for the more well off. This
sparked off the Peasants Revolt of
1381 in which Wyatt Tyler achieved
fame. After then the tax was only
imposed o n foreigners living i n
Britain.
Poll taxes do not always raise the
amount of money expected. The
difficulty w i t h a shortfall i n
collection is that simultaneous with
the abolition of domestic rates,
businesses will not pay rates direct
to local councils. A national business
rate will be set, and all money
collected will be redistributed to
councils according to population
rather than the locality of the area.
The twelve inner London boroughs
currently receive £1,123 million i n
business rate income. H a d the
National Business Tax been in force
last year, this income would have
dropped to £447 million, a decrease
of 60%. Some of the shortfall may
have to be met by Poll Tax payers.
The Business Rates will be fixed
so any council which overspends its
budget will have to transfer all the
extra burden onto the rate payer.
There are several questions raised
by a compulsory registration for the
tax with regards civil liberties.
Foreign residents w h o wish to
remain anonymous from certain
government forces will probably be
able to come to an arrangement with
their local council to assume an alias
for the purpose of the register. The
spectre of 'snooper' has been raised;
many people fear that there may be
an army of collectors searching for
non-payers, and if these people do
come into operation which files are
they going to be allowed to see?
Officially such things as the electoral
register will not be used, but it does
seem a little difficult to imagine that
they w o u l d not check u p o n
someone w h o was registered to
vote, but not registered to pay the
tax. Non-payment will carry a
surcharge of £50 on top of the final
bill.
So y o u may be asking, so whaL
surely the difference will be met by
a drop i n hall fees or rents when.
rates are taken out? This, sadly, is
not automatically the case. The rates
for College halls are paid for by the
U G C and intercollegiate halls have
their's paid for by the University
Court Department which is U G C
funded. The U G C is itself on the
verge of abolition and so it seems
very unlikely that the replacement
University Funding Committee will
pay your Poll Tax. Accommodation
outside halls will not necessarily go
down automatically for the rents
would have to be registed before
landlords had a legal obligation to
reduce them with the abolition of
rates. Most rents do not fall into this
category. Student grants will not be
increased to pay for the extra
expenditure.
So what are the alternatives?
Opposition parties agree with the
G o v e r n m e n t that the present
system is not fair. However, they
believe the Poll Tax to be even more
unfair. The Labour Party would like
to introduce a combination of local
income tax and property tax. The
Democrats would like to see a local
income tax.
Opinion Bit
"The Poll Tax is fair only in the sense
that the Black Death was fair; it is
indiscriminate, striking young and
old, rich and poor, employed and
unemployed alike'—Tory Reform
Group, March 1987.
As this is an opinion article I shall
resist from calling the Poll Tax a
Community Charge, for it is by
definition a tax on voting. Having
c a m p a i g n e d i n several local
elections it is clear that the present
rating system is unpopular, and
frequently the example is given of
a grey haired old widow paying the
same rates for her semi as the M r
and M r s Jones and working son or
daughter next door. The unfairness
of the system is not just that one
person is paying the same as three,
but that there is a differential i n
incomes. A t present it happens that
a handful of areas of a borough may
pay the majority of the rates for that
town. However, they are out-voted
at district elections by people who
are not affected so much by the
increase i n rates. Thus resentment
has built u p w h e n e v e r rates
increase. The Conservatives hope
that by making everyone (bar the
poor and other exceptions) pay the
same that the chances of the
Conservatives gaining control of
councils increases.
The Poll Tax will also further
diminish the student grant yet
further as no allowance will be
made. The Poll Tax will also cost
more (about twice as much as
present rates) to collect, and there
will be more bureaucracy. It has
been said that a hearth tax (or a
window tax (1697-1815) would be
fairer. Anyway the proof of the tax
will come i n April 1990 when it
arrives through letter boxes and the
ensuing district elections.
