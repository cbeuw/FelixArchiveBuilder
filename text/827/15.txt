Die Hard
It's Christmas Eve and N e w York
cop John McCiane (Bruce Willis)
flies to Los Angeles bearing gifts and
hoping to patch up his marriage.
Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) is also
in L A , but he's not there to give out
presents. He's there to take more
than $600 million in exchangeable
bearer bonds from the multinational
N a k a t o m i C o r p o r a t i o n , where
McClane's wife is an executive.
McCiane arrives in the midst of a
Christmas party in celebration of the
company's most successful year
ever. Meanwhile, Gruber and a
d o z e n f e l l o w terrorists are
m e t i c u l o u s l y sealing off the
building, after which they take the
staff hostage. But McCiane is not
amongst them. He has taken it upon
himself to disrupt their finely laid
plans, armed only with his service
automatic. The terrorists are packing
Uzi sub-machine guns and plastic
explosives, and they don't stand a
chance.
The fairly routine plot structure -
Hunchback of Notre Dame meets
Towering Inferno - is transformed
via some refined direction by John
McTiernan (Predator), skillfully
efficient and absorbing acting, and
some caustic humour and satire,
into a brilliant and thrilling example
of how an action movie should be
made.
Bruce Willis' previous disastrous
forays into the motion picture biz
(Blind Date, Sunset) can be forgiven.
He sheds his smart-ass image
becoming a tough guy, reluctant
hero.
Clad in a white vest and running
around i n bare feet he carefully
assesses the strengths a n d
weaknesses of his adversaries,
becoming a 'spanner in the works,
a monkey i n the wrench'. Willis is
quite excellent in the role, displaying
a hitherto unforseen aptitude for
this action-adventure stuff.
But he really is totally upstaged by
a w i c k e d l y sophisticated a n d
sardonic portrayal of Gruber by
Rickman, an R S C actor, previously
renowned for his stage performance
in Les Liaisons Dangereuses. He is the
ultimate i n cool-dome; assured,
smooth and deadly. H e electrifies
the screen with his presence and is
oddly appealing. T am not an
ordinary thief, I am an exceptional
thief he roars with a maniacal
intensity.
The film engages our emotions
from the outset and makes us cry
out at the ineptitude and downright
idiotic antics of the police and FBI
agents, who can never get their act
together. The FBI i n particular,
represented by Agent Johnson and
Special Agent Johnson (no relation),
are hilarious, dressed in expensive
finally emerging as a king with
whom we feel England will be safe.
In the first half we are treated to
fine comic scenes; these are centred
in an Eastcheap inn and later, in the
Cotswolds. Barry Stanton as Falstaff
provides an excellent comic focus.
His cowardice and cunning drop
him into tricky situations out of
which he wriggles (or waddles) his
way.
Falstaff is the perfect buffoon, he
realises this to some extent saying;
T am not only witty in myself, but
the cause of wit i n other men'
Through all his using scheming
Falstaff displays a real affection for
Hal, always having in mind (though
often his motives are selfish),
inventing new amusements for
Prince Harry.
Falstaff uses his friendliness with
Hal to borrow money and w i n
favour. The final scene in which Hal
Dangerous
Liasons
If he who lives by the sword also
dies by the sword, then what of the
man who lives by the powers of
seduction? Choderlos de Laclos first
posed this question i n his erotic
novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses.
His story of the nimble
gamesmanship of the pre-revolution
French aristocracy was turned into
a successful play by the RSC, which
rivetted audiences with a series of
psychological twists. N o w comes
suits, shades a n d Rambo
mentalities. Stereotypes maybe, but
good fun all the same.
There are no doubts about the
entertainment value of this film. It
is tense, g r i p p i n g , i n parts
intentionally hilarious, and it'll have
you jumping in your seats. This is
something you won't want to miss.

rejects Falstaff, gives Falstaff a
severe knock and he is broken (for
a while at least).
This production is a little rough at
the edges. Sometimes the
supporting cast delivers its lines
with a lacklustre manner (many of
its members have large roles in other
plays) but the standard is generally
high. The mix of costumes from
different periods helps emphasise
the characters from Henry IV down
to the tavern derelicts.
Michael Bogdanov has included
some good directional tricks which
bring fresh life to an already spirited
play. This is a good production,
getting the balance between comedy
and seriousness right. Seeing it after
Henry IV parti would be best; the
two together making a good set
although parti stands well on its
own.
Patrick Smith
the b i g screen H o l l y w o o d
adaptation starring Glenn Close
(Fatal Attraction), John Malkovitch
(Empire of the Sun), arid Michelle
Pfeiffer (Witches of Eastwick).
The screenplay keeps true to the
spirit of the play, both having been
written by Christopher Hampton,
and the period details and locations
look stunning.
The film is set i n a time of
legendary decadence, with wealthy,
perfumed characters fully dedicated
to the pursuit of their o w n pleasure.
They spin for themselves a plot of
labyrinthine sexual intrigue as they
succumb to each others seduction.
Dangerous Liaisons promises to be
a visual delight, but will probably go
down with countless others as a film
which didn't quite match its stage
impact. Release Date 10th March.

Henry IV
part 2
England is still troubled by civil war.
Hal, the Prince of Wales has
resumed to his bawdy haunts. Hal's
friend Falstaff, a decadent, inept and
old knight, is i n the Cotswolds
putting his newfound, false, glory
for great financial advantage.
A new group of rebels led by the
Archbishop of York, build a new
army. The rebels are confronted by
the King's son, Prince John, and are
captured.
H e n r y I V is d y i n g ; o n h i s
deathbed he and Hal are reconciled.
Hal is crowned Henry V and rejects
his former companions.
Henry IV part 2 relies heavily on
part 1. In structure it is similar,
having a largely comic first act and
a more serious second act; the
scenes roughly correspond to those
in part 1. There is a substantial
continuation of character a n d
theme, making it a play best seen
with a knowledge of part 1.
The play builds up through both
acts to the reconciliation scene,
much of the action points towards
this. Throughout the play in Michael
Cronin as Henry IV w e see a
character battling to appear tough
and struggling with his guilt of
usurping the crown (which he
begins to see as a curse); his
thoughts about Hal become more
desperate as his illness gets worse.
Hal realises and embraces his
responsibilities as the play develops,
