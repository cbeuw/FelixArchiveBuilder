Opinion
Creation v Darwin
Introduction
M y sole purpose in writing this
article is to demonstrate that it is
perfectly possible to h o l d a
fundamentalist Christian faith and
yet still be a rational scientist. I
believe that the concept that there
is a dichotomy between science and
the Bible and its claims is fallacious.
A more correct idea is that held by
the ancient Greeks that science and
t h e o l o g y are b u t facets of
philosophy. This article will explore
three contentious areas: the origins
of life, the philosophy of science and
the theology of science.
The origin of life
Christians believe that salvation is
by faith; w h y then do so many put
so much energy into the creation/
evolution debate which would seem
to be somewhat irrelevant to the
central doctrine of Christianity. The
reason is that certain Christians
(myself i n c l u d e d ) c o m m o n l y
labelled as fundamentalists believe
the Bible to be the inspired word of
G o d , the history and teaching of
which is to be read as literal; this
includes the creation account i n
Genesis 1 and 2 which even upon
c u r s o r y e x a m i n a t i o n directly
contradicts evolutionary theories
developed since the time of Darwin.
So what are the scientific argu-
ments behind creationism a n d
evolution?
Few would deny that evolution
forms the backbone of modern
biology which, if broken, would
have a far more radical effect o n
biology than Einstein's views did on
physics. Despite only having the
somewhat elevated state of a theory,
evolution is taught as a fact at all
levels of biology. It is assumed that
everyone believes it a n d it is
considered unscientific not to. Yet
the following scientists all believed
in creation; J C Babbage, ] A
Fleming, Lord Kelvin, J Lister, J C
Maxwell, L Pasteur, Lord Rayleigh,
G Stokes and M Faraday. To present
theory as fact is itself a gross
scientific misconduct and yet can
either evolution or creation ex nihilo
(from nothing) be r e g a r d e d
scientifically as theory?
Scientific m e t h o d requires
observations of a phenomonen to be
made followed by a hypothesis
being formulated to explain these
observations. O n e then does
experiments to try and disprove the
h y p o t h e s i s . If, after m u c h
experimentation, y o u have not
d i s p r o v e d , it the h y p o t h e s i s
becomes a 'theory'. A universally
not disproven theory is often
regarded as a law. Using this
method creation ex nihilo a n d
evolution can at best be regarded as
vague notions, as unless one has
travelled in time, to observe these
processes as they are supposed to
incompleteness a n d creationists
maintain that it originates from
Noah's flood.
Molecular Biology
The similarity of basic protein
strutures in all species leads to the
Bishop Samuel Wilberforce
have occurred, one cannot conduct
experiments to test the accuracy of
one's ideas. Therefore scientifically
both theories d e p e n d o n
circumstantial evidence a n d
conjecture, the basis of which can
always be disputed and yet never
objectively resolved. The concept of
evolution is the spontaneous
occurrence of mutations resulting in
variation between individuals which
are selected by the environment to
the benefit of those individuals best
adapted to it.
Creation ex nihilo argues that G o d
created the world from nothing as
per the Genesis account and that
science purely observes what has
been made.
I shall now give more examples of
equivocal evidence used b y
protaganists of the two theories
before c o n s i d e r i n g G o d a n d
miracles.
Fossil Record
Evolutionists cannot explain its
construction of evolutionary trees.
It is equally plausable that a rational
G o d would have a basic adaptable
unit of design.
Anthropology
The evidence for the decent of man
is far from conclusive.
Age of the Earth
Depends on the method used.
M e a s u r e m e n t s o n a l u m i n i u m
deposits give an estimate of 100
years!
The philosophy of science.
It was Aristotle who first put
forward the concept of theology
which states that all that can be
observed i n the universe tends
towards its cause, ie G o d . This belief
was held in the early church. The
initiation of the dichotomy between
science and religion was caused by
the publication of Summa Theo-
logiae and Summa Contra Gentiles
by Dave
Thomas
by St. Thomas of Aquinus in the
thirteenth century. This argued for
the use of reason within faith and
this is the forerunner of modern
apologetics. In the fiffeeenth century
William of Occum developed what
is commonly called Occum's Razor
Principle ie that the simplest
hypothesis that accounts for the
observed data is probably the most
correct. The birth of modern science
was in the sixteenth century with
C o p e r n i c u s ' s T h e o r y of the
heliocentric universe and Bacon's
development of modern scientific
method with hypotheses being
substantiated by observed data and
not by reason as had previously
been the case. Does science have
limits within which it can operate?
Science cannot explain where
precisely the universe came from
however elaborate Big Bang theories
may become. Science cannot explain
scientific l a w b u t c a n merely
elucidate what it is from the
phenomena observed. For example
why are there positive, neutral and
negative electrical charges, w h y 3
such charges and not four? Science
is a consequence and not a cause of
the laws of creation that it observes.
It seeks to u n i f y observed
phenomena believing there to be an
integrity to creation and the whys
must be left to philosophy a n d
theology. It is interesting to observe
that 'Das Kapital' by Marx was
published in 1848, 11 years prior to
'The Origin of Species' by Darwin
in 1859. Marx's famous one liner
was 'religion is the opium of the
people', and yet has communism
brought any greater happinesss to
the world than religion? T H Huxley
and C Lyell, both fierce protagonists
of Darwin's views, were sworn
atheists (Darwin became a Christian
just before his death and realised
that G o d was behind creation). It
may be reasonably stated that the
adoption of evolutionary theory by
the scientific community of the late
nineteenth century was a deliberate
attempt to free it from what it
regarded as the shackles of the
Church. Since then evolution has
been used to further the causes of
Marxism and scientific humanism
and to disprove G o d . The result of
this prevalence of science in society
can only lead to the conclusion that
'science is the opium of the people'.
Yet to return to the principle of
Occum's Razor evolutionists in their
attempts to prove evolution beyond
doubt produce ever more complex
and esoteric ideas which viewed by
"The Razor' seem ever less plausible
