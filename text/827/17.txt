Gilbert &

For many years now the Imperial
College Operatic Society has been
putting on a show in February. This
year's production is the famous
Gilbert and Silivan opera, The Pirates
of Penzance. The show has many
famous songs i n c l u d i n g A
Policeman's Lot is not a Happy One.
This year's production is to be
highly entertaining and amusing. If
you think that opera is boring and
only for the 'over forties' think
again.
The show is on every night from
13 to 17 February. Monday to
Thursday, the performances start at
7.30pm, on Friday the performance
starts at 8.00pm.
Tickets are available i n advance

Abdus Salaam
Speaks
The Overseas Students' Committee
has invited Professor Abdus Salaam
to give a lecture o n his life and
career. It will be held on Monday
February 6 at Lecture Theatre 213,
Huxley Building at 12.40pm.
For those familiar w i t h the

awaiting this event. But for those
who haven't heard of him, he is a
Professor in Theoretical Physics and
he w o n the Nobel Prize for Physics
in 1979. He is world-renowned and
has had a very interesting career.
He is usually not i n Imperial
College as he works in Trieste, Italy

International Centre for Theoretical
Physics. S o this is a golden
opportunity not to be missed.
Please note that d u e to the
extremely busy schedule of the
Professor, w e might have to
reschedule the talk to a later date.
Keep a lookout for the posters.
CROSS COUNTRY
200 Line-Up
Cross Country Club Report
The IC Cross-Country team, easily
the strongest collegiate team i n
U.L., recently consolidated its
overall fifth position in the London
Colleges League (which includes the
Polys and 6th-form Colleges) with
a solid fourth place at Trent Park.
A field of nearly 200 lined up at
the start of the five mile race. The
usual sprint start left most of us
gasping immediately, with Frank
Dudbridge around 20th, Alex
Gaskell 25th, and Matt Lynas,
Stefan Ledin and Dave Knight all
conserving their energy in the fifties.
The early frantic pace had settled by
halfway, by which time Frank had
moved through to 12th, and Matt,
Stefan and Dave were working their
way through the forties. Alex had
suffered a recurrence of a hip injury,
and to avoid further damage slowed
down to eventually finish 60th.
The second half of a cross-country
is usually a punishing slog, during
which your motivation for this sport
is severly questioned! However, a
FILMSOC
Dolce Vita
This Thursday Filmsoc presents 'LP
Dolce Vita,' Fellini's erotic classic.
Marcel Mastroianni a n d Anita
Ekberg gave excellent performances
which, when coupled with Fellini's
bizarre visual syle results in a movie
that still has the ability to shock
twenty nine years after its initial
release in 1960. The film deals with
the prophetic vision of a generations
spiritual and moral decay with
Mastroianni as a hack seeking
sensational stories by bedding
wealthy socialites. Beautiful
cinematography completes the
visual experience. See What's on for
details.

good position at the end makes the
pain disappear remarkably quickly,
and personal best placings were
achieved by Frank, Matt, Stefan and
Bill Skailes, in 7th, 38th, 46th and
56th places respectively. Dave
Knight, involved i n a keen battle
with Matt and Stefan i n the later
stages, recorded his best this year
with 42nd. Another creditable
performance came from John
Rowland, with 67th.
In the women's section, Alison
Horrocks admitted to having a bad
run, finishing 24th. Despite the
lowly-sounding postions of our
runners, one must bear in mind the
overall size of the field (150 men)
and the quality of the leading
athletes (the race was w o n by a
county champion). The fact that
over 20 minutes separated first and
last (a Kings runner, of course)
reflects the very wide range of
ability supported by this sport.
The club will be staging the Hyde
Park Relay on Feb 18th, one of the
major inter-university fixtures of the
year. All enquiries regarding this to

FOOTBALL

Unbeaten
Imperial College VI—1
St Bartholemews—1
IC VI continued their resurgence up
the table with a bruising draw to
extend their unbeaten run to 4
games. I n a h i g h l y p h y s i c a l
confrontation, IC took the lead horn
an exquisite move from the back,
finished off by A n d y Draine, after
some brilliant one-touch football.
Just before half-time, Martin Cole's
superbly timed covering tackle was
judged a foul by the referee due to
some theatrics by the forward, and
Barfs equalised from the subsequent
free-kick. A rare defensive lapse
nearly a l l o w e d Barts to
(undeservedly) steal the lead, but
the post and then Martin Cole
quickly came to the rescue to clear
the danger. Eiji Fukumuro nearly
won the game for IC when his
thundering header went just wide
with the goalkeeper helpless.
Turkey
The Turkey campaign is n o w
entering its final stage in which the
l o b b y i n g of members of the
European Parliament is carried out
by different A I Groups. The IC
Group, together with the Putney
and Kingston Groups are currently
in contact with Dave Stelagh
Roberts. This lobbying aims to have
a certain pressure exerted on Turkey
for an improvement of the H u m a n
Rights record. A n increased
j.vareness b y the E u r o p e a n
Parliament members of the reality of
the violation of H u m a n Rights i n
that country is particularly
important at a time when it seeks to
present a clean image in the issue
of H u m a n Rights with a view to
become a members of the E E C .
So far, we have been contacting
MPs and have obtained responses
from the Labour Group and Toby
Jessel (Tory M P for Twickenham)
who assured us they were ensuring
that the Foreign Office should
closely monitor Turkish polkv and
practices on such issues.
Thanks to all those who helped.
RIFLE & PISTOL
Victory
On 1st February a ten men team
from Cambridge University arrived
at IC to face the might of our pistol
team. Two courses of five were shot:
one small bore and one full bore.
Despite being out of practice the
Imperial team (P. Deeks, I. Draper,
R. Winskill, A . Jones, M . Lacey and
T. Menzies) managed to pull off a
victory in both these competitions
winning the small bore 970-838 and
the full bore 1055-898.
