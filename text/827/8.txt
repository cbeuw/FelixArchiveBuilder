Welfare
This is welfare
by your Welfare Advisor, Yve Posner
Miami Beach
coast, and there are several cinemas,
a red light area (surprise, surprise)
and a McDonalds.
As such, this provides a more
conventional resort. It is a sun-
worshippers paradise and centre for
local excursions. W e took several
and lazed around the pool for the
rest of the time.
Key West. This is t h e
southernmost tip of Continental
U S A . Actually it is an island and I
can't understand how it qualifies.
It's extremely pretty and some of the
buildings date back almost a
hundred years. Y o u quickly learn
that anything dated earlier than the
second world war is regarded as
antique and so such history as exists
in K e y West is proudly manifest.
A f t e r t a k i n g pictures at t h e
monument, with Hurricane Gilbert
200 miles away i n the background
we went to the U S Mail Office. The
teller refused to sell stamps for
Britain. The postal strike was on and
he seemed convinced that our
postcards would be burned and
didn't want me to blame h i m when
they w e r e . Does a n y b o d y
understand this?
The Everglades. Imagine an area
of l a n d , 2188 square miles,
completely covered with long grass
and water. Sound boring? It is. For
a fee you can get out amongst all the
grass i n a n airboat, see a few
alligators swimming around, and
wait politely for it all to end. The
gators would have been interesting
but w e ' d seen t h e m earlier,
wrestling with some native Indians.
I joined in, shouted 'handbag!' at
one then grabbed it while it
cowered. Okay, the Indian caught
a baby, taped its mouth u p and
passed it to me. Same thing. The
Indians themselves proved to be the
most pleasant people we met, even
compared to the Disney clones.
Our remaining week was filled
spontaneously. A day trip around
M i a m i was spoiled only b y the
promise of D o n Johnson, who did
not appear. W e d i d see J F
Kennedy's flame for eternal peace,
which was out, and wandered
around Coral Gables and Bayside,
where much of Miami Vice is
filmed. It all looks as pretty and
expensive as the television series
makes it seem.
The nightlife of Miami exists
mostly i n a n area called
'Downtown'. This is also where
most of the people in the world get
mugged and it is so far from Miami
Beach that it is difficult to reach
anyway, even if you want to get
your throat cut. W e were forced to
spend the evenings at a cinema or
eating take away pizzas in the hotel
room, watching T V .
O n the last day, the Dolphins
played home to Green Bay Packers,
and i n the glory of Joe Robbie
Stadium we saw the Packers get
stuffed, ate hot dogs and caught
sunburn. A fitting end to a fortnight
of alternative entertainment.
America
The only generalisation which can
be made about America is that it
cannot be generalised. It would be
unfair to do so on the basis of a
holiday i n Florida anyway. A
country this large (there are only
three in the k n o w n universe which
are bigger) must b y nature be
immensely diverse or terribly
monotonous, and while bits are
undoubtedly flat and boring (the
Everglades, Salt Lake) most is not.
The best guide to most countries,
at least i n terms of culture and
society, is television. Being in Rome
(as the saying goes) we swallowed
huge quantities of this medium. It
provided a confused, overbearing
and m i x e d b a g of goodies,
entertainment with a n identity
crisis. This confirmed my suspicions
that nobody can really explain what
a typical American is, least of all
themselves.
In many ways though the States
is similar to Britain. Far more
expensive in some situations, much
cheaper in others. While I cannot tell
you the best place to go for a
holiday, you could do much worse
than Florida.
A n d y C l a r k e
This year Imperial College Students'
Union has made welfare a high
priority. Mark Fisher, Physics 2,
took on the job of Union Welfare
Officer in late October 1988 and the
Union has also appointed a full-time
Welfare Advisor, Yve Posner, who
joined the College in January.
Welfare covers a wide variety of
subjects but during the Week
13th-17th February the emphasis
will be on Welfare Rights i n the
areas of benefits, housing and
immigration.
Every year millions of pounds ol
Welfare Benefit goes unclaimed bv
all sectors of the population. Some
people are too proud to claim, many
are put off by the bureaucracy of
claiming and others just do not
realise what their rights are.
Therefore part of this campaign is to
raise awareness of Welfare Benefits
and to encourage students to claim
what is theirs by right.
A handout has been produced
outlining the benefits which some
or all students can claim. These will
be available at various places
throughout t h e College. T h e
benefits covered include.
Housing Benefit
Income Support
Health Benefits
Family Credit
Child Benefit
Disability Benefit
In addition to this, various
specialists will be available during
lunchtimes i n the JCR to answer
questions (for details see below).
Housing, of course, is one of the
major problems faced by students.
Not only is it difficult to find
accommodation b u t it is also
expensive and many people are at
the mercy of u n s c r u p u l o u s
landlords.
If you want to find out more about
your rights as a tenant, then come
along and speak to the speacialists.
Imperial College has over 1,100
Overseas students w h o face
additional problems. Many students
from abroad have only limited leave
to enter the country and may
< ; icounter difficulties if they need to
vary this leave or extend its duration
tor any reason. There are also
restrictions regarding rights to
benefits for many overseas students.
The United Kingdom Council for
Overseas Students A f f a i r s
(UKCOSA) is an organisation set up
to promote and protect the interests
of overseas students. It provides
advice, t r a i n i n g publications
concerning the issues faced daily by
students from abroad. O n February
16 1989 a representative from
U K C O S A will be available to
answer queries.
There are, of course, many other
situations which arise when it's
important to know one's rights. For
example what happens if your new
Walkman chews up its first tape,
you find a slug in your lettuce or
your next door neighbour keeps you
awake all night with loud music?
These are some of the other areas
'Benefits and Rights Week' aims to
address. T h e U n i o n Welfare
Advisor and other Benefits/Rights
specialists will be available to
answer your questions so it's up to
you to exercise your rights and come
to see them.
