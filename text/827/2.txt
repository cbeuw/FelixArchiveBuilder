Evelyn Merger
Dear Bill,
The proposal to merge Willis Jackson a n d
H o l b e i n Houses, it has been sugested could
be accomplished before the start of the next
academic year. The benefits of this w o u l d be
the conversion of one of the warden's flats and
the possible conversion of a subwarden's flat
into student accommodation. The cost of these
improvements, providing 3 to 5 places, w o u l d
obviously be quite large a n d w o u l d have to
be met by the already overstrained Residences
account. T h e merger w o u l d result i n a
deterioration i n social life, quite apart from the
financial considerations. A t present there is a
m a r k e d difference between the social life i n
the three smaller Evelyn Garden Houses, and
the sterility a n d isolation apparent i n
S o u t h w e l l a n d Fisher Halls.
It has been argued that few of the students
in Willis Jackson gave preference to this house
on application forms. This to some extent also
true of other E v e l y n G a r d e n houses, because
of their isolation f r o m college, but the vast
majority of the present residents w o u l d not
n o w w i s h to move. It seems ridiculous that
the opinions of people w h o , at that point h a d
not even seen the house or attended college,
are p u t f o r w a r d as a reason for the merger.
There is very little enthausiasm amongst the
students at either H o u s e for these plans, a n d
the H o u s e Committee at Willis Jackson has
resolved to fight them. W e hope the college
can f i n d o t h e r w a y s t o r e s o l v e i t s
accomodation crisis.

UGM
Dear Bill,
I attended the U G M last week for the first
time for a while, and was not surprised to find
that the usual tricks of putting the interesting
business last were still going o n . W h e n this
occurs, to help along business often before
q u o r u m is called, I do not object, but there was
only one issue i n w h i c h two-thirds of those
present were interested. Business was s p u n
out for an h o u r before the motion o n U G M
abolition was discussed, a n d sufficiently long
for people w i t h 2.30 lectures to have to leave
before v o t i n g was completed. The audience
was considerably reduced before this occured.
A n u m b e r of appeals f r o m the front of the
m e e t i n g w e r e m a d e , to g i v e s e r i o u s
consideration to separate parts of the motion
concerning the merger w i t h St M a r y ' s . It d i d
indeed deserve better treatment than it
received, but the majority of the audience was
faced w i t h the choice of a vote n o w or never,
it was voted d o w n entirely. G i v e n the w a y i n
w h i c h t h e m e e t i n g is h a n d l e d , it w a s
impossible to produce any useful decisions
f r o m any point w i t h i n the motion, except that
U G M abolition was not acceptable.
A t t e n d i n g a U G M to vote o n an issue I feel
strongly about, is virtually the only time that
I have contact w i t h the workings of the U n i o n .
I a m not surprised that all other students w i t h
w h o m I have discussed this motion, have
agreed that U G M abolition is unaceptable. The
one point of the college organisation w h i c h
has impressed me while being a student here
ds the openness of the system to the electorate
to compel the wishes u p o n a disinterested
Executive, or to curb its excesses. This has
always seemed a sharp contrast to elections
outside college.

Support
Dear Bill,
In the Alternative Prospectus Update published
at the end of last term, the Sub-Editorial stated
that the Undergraduate Studies Committee, 'do
not receive as much support as is necessary to
really gets things done'.
At the Committee's last meeting we discussed
this statement with the Sub-Editor, and I want
to let everyone know, through your columns that
the Undergraduate Studies Committee has never
been delayed in its work by lack of support from
the College, form the Union, from the A U T or
from the board of studies. Indeed the support We
have received from all sources has/ been
magnificent.
College has funded us generously. For
example, we could purchase a mark reader to
process the teaching appraisal forms which
everyone will be invited to complete-in the next
few days. It has also given us funds to meet all
academic staff training, and so to extend the
training given to offered to probationary teachers
so that they do a course i n each of the
probationary years.
The support from college has also allowed us
to institute the reviews of undergraduate teaching
in departments, and by the end of this session
more than half the departments i n college will
have been reviewed. In every case the report of
the review and the changes recbrnmended, have
been accepted by the Board of Studies and by the
department concerned, w i t h o u t major
ammendment. ;
The Board of Studies have also supported us
by accepting important new practices suggested
in our reports. The most obvious will be the
availability to all students, this year, of the
responses to the lecturing appraisal survey in
their department. Other significant changes will
follow the acceptance of o u r report o n
Undergraduate Motivation and Performance
earlier this session, which gave guidelines on
student load, curriculum organisation and tutorial
practice which can be monitored i n o u r
departmental reviews from now on.
Support from students has been positive,
constructive and energetic, both from the student
members of the Committee, from Departmental
Representatives and from students who have met
the assessors during departmental reviews.
We have been criticised for slowness, and there
have been times when w e have consciously
moved slowly in order to give time for others to
accept our point of view. But I think there have
been significant achievments in our three and a
half years of existence.

'Lefties'
Dear Bill,
Last week's F E L I X saw Ian Morris, Julian
M o o r e a n d N e i l M c C l u s k y corner the market
in 'factual inaccuracies'. I w o u l d like to submit
some 'logical inaccuarcies' from their entries.
Regarding the ridiculous Water Polo Loans
posters, I quote Julian M o o r e , Tan Morris saw
the posters a n d agreed that they were totally
illegal, but h e isn't going to create a fuss
because he agrees w i t h the sentiments'. The
question is not whether these posters met with
club committee's approval, but where the hell
is the connection between water polo a n d
student politics! Surely a society is given a
budget A N D an official U n i o n name o n the
basis that they will be used to further the
stated aims of the society. The water polo club
was simply adopted as a tag to legitimise the
political activities of its committee.
The embryonic anti-student loans society
(which n o w merits capital letters i n Julian's
letter a n d so seems to exist) s h o u l d have set
themselves u p and then acted. If they can get
all those innocent students to sign their
petition, then surely they could f i n d twenty
or thirty to f o r m a society.
A s someone w h o attended the first anti-
loans meeting at college I w o u l d like to
contend his denial that they are not 'leftist
hacks' - the whole r o o m smelt of S W S S . They
succeeded i n hijacking the water polo club,
and then went o n to hijack I C U for their o w n
political ends.
I C U is unique. It has been well k n o w n for
being apolitical - w h e n K e n Baker visits most
universities h e gets pelted w i t h eggs a n d
yoghurt, w h e n he visits IC he gets interviewed
by S T O I C . M a n y Lefties w h o come here
complain at the apolitical nature of our U n i o n
- they complain that its n o t fighting their
causes for them. I think most IC students are
generally p r o u d of our student U n i o n a n d its
independant stance. There are signs of this
being erroded - the out of character adoption
of the loans campaign may be the first
example.

Word of advice
Dear Bill,
Last year S y d h a d the good sense to accept
the advice given by Nigel this year - namely
'never write back' to letters i n F E L I X . N i c k
Bradshaw, I C U President 1976/77, imparted
these w o r d s of w i s d o m to his sucessor, H u g h
Barrett, a n d urged me to pass t h e m o n to all
future Presidents, saying that a sensible
President has neither time nor inclination to
indulge i n distasteful slanging matches i n the
media.
i Perhaps it w o u l d be a good extension of the
same principle if past sabbaticals still at college
also refrained f r o m replying to letters i n
F E L I X .
Sincerely,
fen Hardy-Smith
