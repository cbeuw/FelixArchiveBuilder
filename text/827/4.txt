Felix
too far â€”
Do you think I
'
m sexy?
This is the final article in a series of
highly investigative and profound
features, in which a certain student
reveals the heartfelt views of the
students of Imperial College and
Great Britain, on the National Issues
of Union Rats, alcohol enforced
overdrafts and finally but by no
means leastically, the hounding
dilema of the editorial freedom of
FELIX.
The Paper
FELIX uses sentences which are far
too long and words which are far
too gynormous. It deliberately out-
talks the average student reader
whose average IQ is certainly less
than the average FELIX hack's IQ.
A certain student (Syd - Ed) recently
stated that out of a random selection
of 5 Felices he understood at least
PICOCON
SKETCH
For the outsider, attending a science
fiction convention is not unlike
being an alien stranded, helpless on
a strange planet without even a
Speak-and-Spell for company. He is
s u r r o u n d e d b y people whose
language he does not speak and
w h o s e customs he does n o t
understand. To put it another way,
your correspondent spent last
Saturday at Imperial College Science
Fiction society's 'PicoCon'
The culture shock is
instantaneous. T h e outsider,
plucking u p his courage, enters the
hallowed portals of the U n i o n
building and approaches the SFers
at reception. 'Are-you-eye-see-ess-
eff?', the duty SFette enquires ' N o '
he nervously replies. 'Astra?' Again
the answer would seem to be
negative. H e is labeled as a heretic
and is handed a tell tale blue badge.
30% of the contents in at least one
case. T h e underlying purpose
behind this seemingly innocent ploy
is to make F E L I X the only
publication which fully understands
the idiotic farces that take place in
the loony bin. It is a well k n o w n
ploy i n publishing to keep the
dramatic facts secret a n d print
something that is completely
uninformative. FELIX is falling into
this trap. FELIX has totally rejected
the offer of supreme editorial power
from the Union. If this offer had
been accepted the Sabbaticals would
have edited printed and produced
the paper and as a weekly heebie
g i v e n a n Exec N e w s insert.
However the staff are bound b y
some wierd chant of 'Editorial
Freedom' and remain oblivious to
this offer.

The outsider sets out to explore
this strange new world. In the
corner of the entrance hall stands a
black b o a r d optimistically
proclaiming no problems. O n the
wall an arrow points to something
called a 'fanroom'. Intrigued, he
follows it.
What strange creatures inhabit
this place? In one corner a gaggle of
people leant over buzzing, bleeping
computers busy blasting digital
aliens to technicolour smithereens.
In another wizards and hobbits fight
each other with notepads and dice.
At the very back of the room,
hidden behind rows of brightly
painted plastic rockets, sat a
genuine enthusiast, the first of the
day. Al l around people were talking
excitedly of Pratchett and Langford
and Shaw, of the last C O N N I E and
of I C O N 91. T h e outsider,
overwealmed, wanders out.
Upstairs he finds more SFers,
worshippers of the great god Tee-
Vee. H e slips quietly into the room
and stands by the door. O n the
screen, an enormously fat man
explodes. The audience is both
nauseated and delighted. He leaves
events attempted to express his
opinions in a recent rant article. If
he pays a little more attention to
seeking supreme power Ian could
exhibit an outstanding year for his
Union rather than organising discos
for the regular six A m e r i c a n
attenders. FELIX is here to project
a view on every issue. It should be
completely accountable to the
President and totally banned from
printing anything which in anyway
condemns the action of the Union.
In this w a y students will be
protected from the need to express
any opinion or to have any say in
the running of their ruling body. It
is a system which has wprked
brilliantly in Russia. W h y not try it
here in Imperial (Russia)? Come on
FELIX think about it sensibly.
The Editor
Although the best candidate for the
job at the time of the elections easily
beating his opponent to the stark
horror of the existing supremo M s
McHackney, M r William Goodwin
has since been discovered a horrible
fraud. Not only did he run the
election under the false name of Bill,
a tactic strictly outlawed i n the
fading turquoise Union bible, but
his strange sexual history a n d
outrageous sexual perversions were
kept stictly secret. The election was
obviously one of the most successful
cover-ups ever performed. However
since October Bill has come out of
the closet. His harrowing desire to
be the mother of other peoples
babies has been revealed and I
again.
Back i n the entrance hall the
blackboard's luck has run out: it
now informs the world that the bar
will not be open for another hour.
Nearby, worried looking beings in
ICSF sweatshirts discuss lost guests.
The outsider pokes his head
around the door of something
ominously named Battle of the
Plants, fully expecting to see an
aspidistra and a rubber plant locked
in mortal combat. Instead he sees
two dozen humanoids. One of them
gets up and faces the others. He is
handed a piece of paper. A t a signal
he begins to wave his hands about
wildly. The others shout at him,
'Book!', ' F i l m ! ! ' , ' H o w m a n y
Syllables?!!'. Suddenly he jumps up
and points excitedly at some
r a n d o m SFer, apparently the
winner. The prize would seem to be
a question, a question of such
obscurity that no normal person
could possibly answer it. A s a rule,
it is answered correctly. After half
an hour or so, the outsider sidles
out, his head spinning.
It is the afternoon. The blackboard
in the entrance hall is apologising
suspect there is worse to come.
O n the work side there is yet more
scandal. A dark a n d sinister
personality has been revealed i n
wild personal attacks on our meek
president Nigel Baker typified in the
scandalous editorial in which Bill
acccussed M r Baker of being a n
' o v e r g r o w n k i d d i e ' a n d sub-
sequently even sank to the depths
of 'below the belt' personal attacks
and labelled the leader as an 'infant
megalomaniac'. Come on Bill. Nigel
was simply trying to turn over
supreme p o w e r to himself,
invalidate all the views of students
in thr Union, destroy all k n o w n
forms of democracy, conceal all
decisions and actions from FELIX
and the College, and maintain his
blissful relationship with the lovely
doctors and nurses in Paddington.
Is that really to much to ask?
Indeed secret sources have
revealed that the voice heard at the
U G M chanting 'this is exactly how
Nazi Germany started', was that of
M r G o o d w i n himself. We must ask
ourselves how this fiend slipped
through o u r rigorous election
procedure. It must not happen
again. M r G o o d w i n is a ferocious
literary farce who ought to carry a
p o w e r f u l g o v e r n m e n t health
warning to ward off the meek and
submissive staff under his power.
A t the same time deep d o w n Bill is
a soft marsh mallowing character

c o n s i d e r e d a g o o d partner.

Bill but it had to be said.
profusely for the loss of two guests
to bronchitis and the late arrival of
another. R u l i n g committee
members are taking it in turns to
wear a gold hat and gibber inanely.
The convention starts to get going.
The guests are due to speak.
The stars of the show, and the
heroes of the audience, are the SF
authors themselves. These people
know their audience and know how
to make them happy. They read
f r o m their latest books w i t h
unhindered bravura. They describe
the plots of books yet to come.
Graphic descriptions of invasions of
killer stomachs, stories of useless
guards and impractical dragons,
side-swipes at publishers and other
authors: the audience lap it up. This
type of enthusiasm is equally
contageous. The outsider finds
himself laughing at in-jokes he does
not understand. H e is almost
converted.
Suddenly, the speech is over. A n y
questions? A hand shoots up in the
audience. ' I n your book...'. The
effect is rather like having the wind
knocked out of you. The questioner
gives a page reference and asks
