as the truth.
The theology of science
Science a n d technology are the
religion of the twentieth century. In
many cases scientific theory Comes
across as scientific fact in lectures
and past and present scientists of
eminent status are held in awe. This
is aided by the principle of scientific
inertia where new ideas are rejected
for n o greater a reason than the
prevailing scientific establishment
not wishing to admit to being
wrong. Furthermore this cult is
promoted by the use of evermore
esoteric terms which even fellow
scientists out of that particular field
cannot often understand,let alone
the average person in the street who
holds science in awe, believing it to
be the answer to the world's
problems. Yet I believe that the
universe is but a transient state of
God's will and that the supposed
wisdom of men will prove i n the
end to be meaningless as the
universe passes away.
Despite so many breakthroughs in
modern science the world appears
to face more and more disasters and
problems with each passing year.
Science can solve the problems of
malnutrition a n d disease i n the
world and yet its results can often
not be implemented due to society's
political a n d moral inadequacy.
Furthermore disasters and accidents
will always occur to the end of time.
Yet M a r x i s m a n d Scientific
Humanism are based on the concept
that human nature is inherently
good despite it being a result of
r a n d o m chaotic e v o l u t i o n a r y
processes w h i c h M a r x i s m a n d
Scientific H u m a n i s m hold to be
true.
I think that it takes as much faith
to believe in evolution as it does to
believe i n Jesus and the claims that
he made. However, people prefer to
believe in the former rather than the
latter as it makes them feel more in
control of their destiny; talk of
Christ and the Bible makes them feel
uncomfortable. I think that modern
science has i n itself become a
religion which is the very thing that
it was originally trying to escape
from and still tries to remain distinct
from. O n e must ask the question:
'Does science limit my perception of
G o d o r does G o d fulfil m y
p e r c e p t i o n of science? ' T h e
centrality of science i n modern
thinking means that many people
f i n d it i m p o s i b l e t o have a
perception of G o d . Yet science can
neither prove nor disprove G o d :
'For since the creation of the world
God's invisible qualities - his eternal
power and divine nature - have
been clearly seen, being understood
from what has been made, so that
men are without excuse.'
(Romans lv20)
Loans
publicity
Student loans and the associated
benefit cuts form the biggest ever
threat to education in this country
in recorded history.
Contrary to popular opinion the
benefit cuts are not i n the white
paper for student loans, but were
passed in last year's Social Security
Reforms Bill. These cuts are total,
and will mean that students can
claim no benefits either during term
time or over the Summer vacation.
This includes rent rebates, housing
benefit, and income supplement.
Students will also have to pay 20%
poll tax, although this may be
increased to 50%. N o increase i n
grant will be made to compensate
for this. For many students this will
result in an £800 per annum loss of
income, and a projected debt of
£6000 over a three year course. A l l
these figures are before the grant is
frozen.
This will have knock on effects in
education as students with large
debts will not be able to to accept
poorly p a i d teaching jobs,
producing a shortage of qualified
' A ' level teachers.
This will then, over a period of
five years, create a massive collapse
in education, as teachers will not be
able to train students to a standard
to make them caoable of teaching
' O ' level. This will increase the
shortage of educated people, and
people w h o are educated are
needed by industry. It seems that
we are starting a five year charter to
destroy the education system which
took so long to achieve. There will
also be a massive class divide set up
denying some of the country's most
intelligent people a univeristy
education. Despite this our Union
is doing its best to deny students
information concerning action being
taken to fight loans, and is in some
cases deliberately lying, so as to
mislead students. This was most
notable o n the First of February
demonstration, organised by a
committee of seven, consisting of six
Union presidents, and a member of
the U L U Executive.
Of these seven, none were
members of the Socialist Workers
Party and only one, namely Keith
Budden ( U L U Executive), a member
of Militant.
O n Tuesday 24th January I
personally informed Nigel Baker
that he could get any information he
needed about the march from either
of the S O A S co-presidents. I also
informed him that the organising
group were not members of Socialist
Worker.
In full knowledge of this he
proceeded to write an 'Executive
announcement' he knew to be
factually incorrect. The actual
content of this announcement, and
its wording were never agreed by
ICU Executive.
This factually incorrect announ-
cement, along with the correct but
incomplete 'Loans demo faces set
back' news story in FELIX was the
only information students were
permitted to receive, and o n the
basis of these most students decided
that the march was liable to be a
badly organised riot.
The London Loans Campaign
group (the organisers) produced a
poster, and a leaflet to promote the
march, but these posters were torn
down by the Union.
These posters did not contravene
any of the Union publicity rules, and
when asked for the reason for
removal of the posters, Ian Morris
(Hon Sec Events), read through the
rules and settled on rule ten. This
is as follows-
10. Interpretation Interpretation of
these rules rests with I C U House
Commitee and the I C U publicity
officer.
I then asked h i m which rule he
was interpreting, and he restated
rule 10.
Since he was not interpreting any
rule he could not invoke rule 10.
Since then I a n h a s been
approached by Fizz Marsh (Union
Publicity Officer) and asked for an
explanation. He then changed his
m i n d a n d said that H o u s e
Committee agreed that all posters
must have the name of an i C U club
on them. This was not a valid excuse
for the following two reasons-1) The
posters had I C U SWSS written on
them. 2) rule 11 of the publicity rules
clearly states-
11. Alteration Alteration of these
rules is subject to a majority decision
by I C U Council.
Therefore House Committee had
no power to make such a decision
and by not allowing the posters to
be d i s p l a y e d I a n a n d N i g e l
overturned a decision of Council,
and broke the constitution to which
they are bound.
O n the day (Wednesday 1st) we
proved ourselves. The march was
well stewarded, and over t w o
thousand people attended. The
march stayed o n the route, a n d
there was not a single arrest.
Of course most of you won't have
been on the march, or know much
about it's organisation and success,
but so long as no-one complains
when your Executive lie to you, or
restrict your access to information -
you will retain 'your right to be
deceived'.

WALTER
Just for once, Walter intends to leave
the whole miserable business of
Union politics alone for this week,
and to concentrate on a far worthier
matter. That's right, friends and
neighbours, it's that Valentines time
of year again.
Different people celebrate the day
of St Valentine for different reasons.
Among our o w n ranks, Eric A s h
celebrates because it reminds him of
when he met Clare, and Chas
Brereton celebrates because it
remind him of the massacre. Walter
celebrates for the simple reason that
this is one season when love is in
the air, and when the whole of the
race is, at least theoretically, i n
harmony. In the spirit of this
harmony, your columnist would
like to suggest a set of matches
which he feels could be made
among various public figures, both
within and without this institution.
To start w i t h , the Catering
Manager Rob Northey should team
up with either of the Roux brothers.
M r Northey's cuisine could only
benefit from this, and the Roux
Brothers have shown a certain
naiveity i n commercial matters
which Rob the Fixer would soon put
paid to. Cecil Parkinson, who has
been psychoanalysed as being i n
need of a mother-figure, should try
a match with Mrs Jen Hardy- Smith,
who i n addition to providing a
mother-figure, would also keep h i m
well o n the straight and narrow.
Mary Whitehouse's husband - poor
man - really ought to see the other
side of life as provided by Cynthia
Paine, and as for Mrs Whitehouse
herself, Walter recommends a dose
of Harvey Proctor; this should at
least be entertaining.
The world of entertainment itself
could see the meeting of Terry
Wogan, who brings junk television
to the boobs among the populace,
and Sky TVs latest find, Dolly
Parton, who brings boob television
to the junk around the world.
A n d finally - for there must
always be an 'and finally' - Walter
would dearly love to see the Union
of Margaret Thatcher a n d Neil
Kinnock, to be subtitled "Gruesome
Grocer and the Welsh W i m p " . O h ,
to be a fly on the wall
