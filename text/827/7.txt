Florida
Getting There
America is the mother of the
hamburger, the large rootbeer, the
fast-food joint. Yet never before
have I encountered such difficulty
in ordering a Big Mac (without large
fries, thank-you) as the time I
entered the McDonald's at 71st and
Collins, M i a m i Beach, Fla. The
problem was the different language
which we share.
This turned out to be a recurrent
trouble. I could speak American
quite well, but that didn't seem to
be enough. The natives are from
such diverse backgrounds and races
that the title 'American' becomes
hideously meaningless. But I don't
intend to tackle the historical
development of the U S of A , nor the
socialogical implications of a mixed
population.
This is the story of a simple
holiday which began a week or so
earlier at three a.m. in the departure
lounge of Gatwick Airport. This is
the first thing you must know about
the United Statesâ€”it is so far away
that you have to fly to get there. You
also need to fill in a little pink form
explaining who you are and why
you never got a n entry visa,
otherwise the U S immigration will
stop you going to your hotel, or in
fact anywhere. F e w people at
Gatwick seem to know of this and
so our holiday kicked off with a
couple of hours of pitiful gibbering
and weeping, fearful of refusal at
the entry gate.
Soon we were up though, and
only eight hours later we were
d o w n again. A brisk walk through
Miami Airport to our internal flight,
on which nobody had bothered to
reserve seats for us, and we were up
again. Florida itself is 400 miles long
and can be covered by a short hop
on a plane. Y o u see, America is big.
So big that anything further than the
drugstore at the end of the street is
usually reached by automobile, and
quite often by plane.
We took off in glorious sunshine,
(Miami was at 90 degrees), and
landed in torrential rain, (Orlando
was at only 86). Florida is k n o w n as
the Sunshine State, and it just can't
be anything more than a tourism
ploy because it rained for three days
Nigel, Chas, Wendy and Bill
without a break. When the sun
came out (and it didn't rain again for
the next twelve days) the
temperature soared and we could
only pray for more rain to cool us
down.
Orlando
Everyone knows of Orlando, if not
by name then by the endless list of
entertainments there. This really is
the Vacation Capital of the World,
no kidding. There are so many
places to go that you have to plan
your time very carefully, or else
move there. Our bus driver (who we
forgot to tip) claimed an acre of land
can be bought, built on, and the
house fully furnished for only
$90,000. It is almost cheaper to
emigrate than to rent a room i n
Southside all year. Hence three
quarters of the State population are
not native Floridians. Hence also
everyone can afford lots of land, and
even the things which are close
together are far apart.
You need a car. Everybody has
one in America, from second grade
upwards it seems. Ours w a s
provided by a friend who was out
there, a n d we remain forever
grateful to him for all the running
around he did.
Day One. We went to Spaceport
U S A . This is the main Earth
terminal for a l l manner of
interplanetary, interstellar a n d
intergalactic flight. It is also possible
to take a bus tour around Kennedy
Space Centre, out to the launch pad
where Discovery was quietly sitting,
all wrapped up i n a giant space-
shuttle cosy. Most of this is free, or
cheap, and it is all inside too, so
when it's teeming down outside this
is an ideal and very interesting place
to go. We met a spaceman although
my friend Neil thought he was only
an actor.
Days Two, Three and Four. Walt
Disney World. Step into the Magic
K i n g d o m a n d y o u enter t w o
hundred and fifty acres of pure
amusement park. A multitude of
rides, restaurants and gift shops
c r a m m e d w i t h Roger Rabbit
paraphernalia. A short monorail trip
away is EPCOT, two hundred and
fifty acres of definitive crowd
control. This is split roughly three
ways also as above. The difference
is the rides take the form of active
museum exhibits. It isn't just the
thrill of the rollercoaster (this being
the appeal of the Magic Kingdom)
but the stimulation of the
imagination too. It was Mickey's
60th Birthday too and I was one of
only a few million visitors to wish
him a happy one.
Day Five. Several years ago an
abysmal film came out by the name
of Jaws 3. It was filmed largely at
Sea world. This is a mix of aquatic
sideshows a n d animal exhibits.
Some of the exhibits are a bit
repetitive, but the shows are
impressive and fun, if you don't
mind a little animal cruelty here and
there. The interesting bits can be
seen in an afternoon, for a mere $21.
Day Six. Our transport had left for
London. We were confined to a
hotel and i n need of a rest. The
television provided the only nearby
entertainment, so we caught up on
a number of video releases, ate
Maltesers, drank Coca Cola Classic
and tried desperately to pack all the
T-shirts w e ' d bought into the cases.
No mean feat.
M i a m i Beach
The City of Miami Beach is an island
three miles from Miami, across
Biscayne Bay. The bay is only four
feet deep, so we were told, but to
this day I remain dubious about
that. The beach is famous and has
come to prominence t h r o u g h
several cameo performances i n a
number of movies and of course
M i a m i Vice. A string of hotels and
unfeasibly expensive houses line the
