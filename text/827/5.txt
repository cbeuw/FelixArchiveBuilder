PGs hit by loans
The proposals outlined i n the
Government's White Paper 'Top up
loans for students', will lead to a
critical shortage of students willing
to take u p Post Graduate study.
This was the consensus of a meeting
of the Post Graduate Students
Committee (PGC), at a meeting last
week at U L U . They claim that the
debt b u r d e n i n c u r r e d as
undergraduates will deter most
graduates continuing in education.
Post Graduates will not be able to
draw on Social Security Benefits
after 1990, under the plans but a
discretionary £5m Access Fund will
be administered by Universities 'for
cases of genuine hardship'. This
The Association of University
Teachers (AUT) have resolved to
continue their boycott of
examinations after describing the
most recent pay offer made to them
as 'Meagre and inappropriately
modest'.
In London, heads of departments
fund will be totally inadequate,
according to the P G C , w h o foresee
severe difficulties for Post Graduates
after the deregulation of rents and
the introduction of Poll T a x .
London, as the region with the
highest rents will be the hardest hit.
Robert Jackson M P , the Higher
Education Minister, informed the
Committee that only mandatory P G
grants would be frozen. Such grants
are held b y clinical students at
Medical Schools. The Government
proposals do not discuss h o w
discretionary awards w i l l be
calculated which are currently
l i n k e d to t h e level of a n
undergraduate grant .
in Q u e e n M a r y ' s College are
refusing to request examination
papers and the A U T are claiming
'total support' in Birkbeck College.
The A U T claim that there are over
30 Universities involved i n the
dispute nationwide.
