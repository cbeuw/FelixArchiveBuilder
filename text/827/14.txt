London Student Editor
The Editorial Board of London
Student, the newspaper of the
University of London Union (ULU),
voted at an Emergency General
Meeting (EGM) o n Monday to
become the first student newspaper
in the country to have a staff editor.
The vote has raised questions
concerning the loss of editorial
freedom for the paper, which is now
under the editorial control of U L U .
The E G M was called to discuss
the financial situation of the paper,
which faces a projected deficit of
£22,000 by June. The paper has
operated without a student editor
since the resignation of sabbatical
editor Jane Headon last term.
Nicola Jones, Vice-President of
U L U with responsibility for Finance
and Administration, proposed the
appointment of staff member
Lawrence Cosnett as editor. The
motion was passed by the five
representatives attending the E G M .
Miss Jones explained that the move
was a 'temporary measure only' and
that she hoped it would be possible
to return the editorial control of the
newspaper to a student sabbatical in
the next academic year.
At the General University Council
on Tuesday. Miss Jones proposed
an increase i n grant for London
Student.
