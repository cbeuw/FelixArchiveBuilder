FELIX
HOW TO BE A
GUILDS MAN
Guilds' Freshers' meeting took
place in M xh. Eng. on the first
Thursday ot term and introduced
the freshers to the Guilds Union
and to its mascots. The lecture
theatre was, as usual, packed
and rowdy.
Chris O'Donnell. Guilds' Presi-
dent, introduced the "Spanner"
to the freshers and informed them
of the " sacred" duties of all
Guildsmen to protect it against
all comers and to remove at any
opportunity Mines' Davy Lamp
and R.C.S.'s Theta. He ended by
introducing Guilds' inviolate
motor vehicle, Boanerges.
The Vice President of the
Union was then exhibited and
subsequently dismantled jn full
view of the audience. His girl-
friend, closely resembling Dick
James, spoke in his place and
described such important events
as Morphy Day and the Guilds/
Mines Carnival.
The floor wasfinallygiven over
to Paul Bradley, the Secretary,
who spoke about the Freshers'
Dinners, and to the representa-
tives of the Entertainments Com-
mittee to describe their activities.
Finally, the freshers \ were
taught the Guilds Chant and the
distinguished gathering broke up
with a rendering of the traditional
" Boomalaka."
P e r e g r i n a t e s
in Southside
In a letter to the wardens of
the Southside halls, Mr. Single-
ton, the college's Chief Mainten-
ance Officer, expresses a dim
view of the fact that in the last
month of last term the Southside
lifts broke down a total of 18
times, mainly due to overload-
ing. He doesn't really mind
paying £4 a time for engineers
from the Otis Co., but makes the
point that it does tend to add up.
Mr. Singleton is also concerned
at the number of times that claus-
trophobic travellers have released
themselves through the engineers
escape hatch. As the lifts run in
pairs in a combined shaft, the
danger of an upward climbing
escapee meeting with a down-
ward coming lift is too great for
Mr. Singleton's peace of mind.
Not that he minds paying £4 to
get the Otis Co to scrape said stu-
dent off the lift, but these things
add up. The escape hatches, he
stresses, are for engineers only.
Resigning himself to the ob-
stinacy of the student breed, he
opines that a notice in each lift,
courteously pointing out that the
hatches are meant for oily greasy
men to use, and not undergradu-
ates, would probably serve to
double the number of escapees.
In a similarly resigned vein, he
has explored the possibility of
erecting a screen between the lift
shafts to protect the miscreants
he is so powerless to stop, but
considers it impractical.
And so he plays his trump
card. Since most cases occurred
at night (or, more correctly, after
closing time) he proposes the
shutting down of all lifts after
11 p.m. Sad news indeed for
those gregarious groups who pre-
fer to do everything together.

from the
B O O K S T A L L
Peasants revolt
This week a notice appeared in
Falmouth Hall gallery; it reads,
" Give us air! Cool down jazzed-
up heating. Citizens of Falmouth
4th estate complain! " By Oct.
11th, 33 of the hall's underprivi-
leged classes had added their
names to the petition in an at-
tempt to get the temperature of
Southside's central heating
lowered, and downtrodden serfs
from across the border in Tizard
were also said to be on the point
of revolt. With luck their com-
plaints will be quelled when the
heating system breaks down in
the near future.
Lord Soper
Lord Super's lecture given to
the joint Christian Societies justi-
fying his involvement in politics,
was remarkable for the way his
idealism was tempered with
realism.
Indeed, his main point was that
the church can no longer merely
preach condemnation of evil, but
must translate the Christian faith
into action—and this is bound to
mean involving itself in the
world's affairs. He contrasted this
view of the Church's role with
that of Billy Graham, who ad-
dresses his hopes only toward the
afte life, and of Enoch Powell
who considers the realm of reli-
gion to be outside the public
sphere, being a purely personal
and charismatic experience. He
mentioned his encounters in Hyde
Park with some Flower Children,
with whose beliefs he had much
sympathy, though he wished they
were more articulately stated. He
had been rather pleased to see
them burning incense, until he
had discovered that this was a
funeral pyre for organised reli-
gion. He believed, of course, that
their opting out of politics is as
unrealistic as it is for the church.
Lord Soper went on to say that
intellectually the church is " in a
mess" and warned that no revival
is likely, though in other ways,
such as CND and Oxfam, the
Christian spirit is very much
alive. He criticised the pragmatic
nature of contemporary politics,
and asserted the need for some
sort of idealistic staff on which to
base political decisions. This
would best be found in the Chris-
tian ethic to which he considered
two principles fundamental.
These were common ownership
and peacemaking, both of which
ideals are to be found in the ser-
mon on the mount.
Time was allowed for questions,
which came at a lively pace. Lord
Soper answered honestly and in-
telligently criticising both politics
and the church where he con-
sidered necessary. His views are
mainly left wing, and he rarely
mentions God, as such, though he
gave scientists the credit for de-
molishing previous naive ideas of
God.
Wells
Soc
hypnotised
Dr. Stephen Black opened the
session for Wells Soc. with an ex-
tremely interesting and entertain-
ing lecture on hypnotism. He
was there to dispel any myth-or-
magic ideas left by last year's
rather unscientific talk. He con-
stantly taunted the audience for
their obvious and natural desire
to see magic before their very
eyes, and emphasized the great
danger there is in the incompetent
and misinformed use of hypno-
tism.
Dr Black had brought along
his own deep trance subject. Mrs\
Marks, to whom the audience
owes many thanks. Through iur.
they saw a convincing and
frightening demonstration of the
true power of hypnotism. Dr.
Black had only to utter her " code
word," omicron, and she immedi-
ately went into a deep trance. To
prove this, Dr. Black told her
that her left arm was numb and
then inserted a large needle, leav-
ing it quivering there. The au-
dience winced, but not Mrs.
Marks. He introduced a post-
hypnotic suggestion that at 10-15
seconds after he brought her out
of the trance she would get up
and close the doors of the tele-
vision monitor. This she did;
then, when asked why, tried to
rationalise the situation with an
unconvincing explanation. Dr.
Black asked for ideas from the
audience as to what hallucination
he could induce in her mind.
Among the suggestions were a
flying saucer, a pint of Guinness,
Harold Wilson and an empty
lecture theatre. He selected the
latter as the first might have been
extremely frightening for her
and the other two were rather un-
likely and would have been
difficult for her to rationalise. He
introduced the idea that the lec-
ture theatre was empty and then
brought her out of the trance:
she looked around her and then
prepared to go home.
The lecture was by no means
-only a stage show; Dr. Black,
who is director of a Nuffield unit
for research in experimental
psycho-physiology, has been con-
ducting experiments on the effects
of hypnotism on brain rhythms
and cortisone production.
In all cases the mental anguish
produced by hypnotism is shown
to be real even if the physical
symptoms which normally pro-
duce it are absent.
Dr. Black offered to send Mrs.
Marks back in time to childhood;
he chose the age of five. A mem-
ber of the audience suggested ad-
vancing her age until death. Dr.
Black carefully and forcibly ex-
plained that this would be an
irresponsible and highly danger-
ous thing to do, but one is still left
wondering just what might have
happened.
