FELIX 5
After the President of the Union, no one has more influence and
power in I.C.'s student affairs than the three constituent College
Presidents. While the campaign to produce the third gathers momen-
tum, FELIX here turns the spotlight on the other two.
A l l a b o u t O ' D o n n e l l
Chris O'Donnell was elected as President of Guilds at the end
of last year by a large majority over Frank Morris. A native of
Sheffield and life-long supporter of the Wednesday, his extra-curricu-
lar activities before coming to I.C. were mainly confined to playing
soccer for his school, a lot of tennis and being Chairman of the local
youth club " running two-day twist sessions and that sort of thing."
Somewhat incapacitated by a
back injury incurred whilst tak-
ing a car to India, before com-
ing to I.C., his Union activities
were few during hisfirstyear, but
in his second year on the Ents
Committee of Guilds and as Pub-
licity Officer for the Albert Hall
Folk Concert, he showed a talent
for advertising and organisation.
Evidence enough is that the Folk
Concert made almost £1,200 for
Carnival. In addition he was
Business Manager for " Phoe-
nix," played soccer for both I.C.
and Guilds, and was a member of
the most imaginative Keogh Hall
Committee for many years.
Chris sees the constituent Col-
leges as providing something with
which a student can immediately
identify. He sees their job as
looking after academic prob-
lems, citing the extremely good
staff-student relations built up
over the years in Guilds, and of
looking after most of the leisure
activities of their members. He
thinks the traditions of a large
number of years help enor-
mously in these respects, point-
ing out the new shields in Mech
Eng entrance hall, which have
appeared after seven years. He
also thinks that the constituent
Colleges simplify the work of
I.C.U., citing as an example that
I.C. has the best calendar of social
events in London (Carnivals,
Balls, etc.), most of which are
run by the constituent Colleges,
and which would be difficult for
one Ents Committee to organise.
He would like to see the consti-
tuent College columns restored
to FELIX. He sums up his views
by saying " The stronger the
constituent Colleges are the
stronger is I.C. Union."
Of the Guilds "Paper dart
image," he points to the attend-
ance at Guilds Union meetings
compared with those of I.C.
Union. " To get enough people
there you've got to attract them
and to do that you must provide
some form of entertainment .
the best kind of entertainment is
audience participation. Once you
have got the people there you can
do some business."
A Degree ?
As a member of the I.C. execu-
tive the Presidents of each Col-
lege have a very important say
in the running of I.C.U. In this
field hefindsCarnival one of his
main interests. He would prefer
Carnival in the spring term, with
much more imagination put into
it. As for student houses he
would like to see them run under
students' control " at least as an
experiment."
The question of behaviour in
the bars concerns him and he
suggested the idea, shortly to be
adopted, of having shutters, as in
Southside, in the Union Bar, so
that people can (hopefully) be
left in there to sober up a bit be-
fore disgorging into Beit Quad
or the Lower Lounge.
Finally, on the subject of com-
bining the many duties of Presi-
dent of Guilds with being a 3rd
year undergraduate he said that
he hopes to get a degree. " It's
a matter of deciding what you
want to do and then doing it.
Most students spend their time
drinking coffee or playing cards,
you've just got to give that up."
COLCUTT
Who the hell is the average
I.C. student anyway ? Nobody
really seems to know, especially
those on the executive council
who dispense the average stu-
dents' money in the Union. After
all, the average student contribu-
butes around £4 a year to the
Union in his fees; and as long
as that comes in, who cares ? It
seems to be unreasonable to take \
figures from elsewhere and put
them in an I.C. context. A sur-
vey in Germany showed that 60
per cent of woman students were
virgin. Don't kid me that's true
at I.C. In fact, it's surprising
that so many women complete
their courses at I.C. Perhaps it
is because, as scientists, they're
used to taking experimental pre-
cautions.
But I digress. Does the average
student do any more than spend
an hour travelling each day:
spend the morning getting bored
in lectures enter the Union por-
tals to wait twenty minutes for a
lousy lunch : exit to attend a
practical: climb back into a tube:
contemplate the legs placed so in-
vitingly in the packed carriage :
cook himself a tin of baked beans:
do some work : listen to " I'm
sorry I'll read that again ": go to
bed? Of course he may go to a
party _on Saturday night. I say
he, because that's what the aver-
age student at I.C. is believed to
be. But nobody knows. They
just know that there are around
250 people who register as
women students.
It is time that I.C. Union made
a determined effort to find out
who its members are. Because
nobody knows, the Union's
£18,000 income a year is spent as
those active in the Union want it
spent.
" It's elementary justice," they
will tell you; " if you want some-
thing out, you've got to put some-
thing in." So you can justify
£1,500 spent in a year on the
Gliding Club. It's rather like giv-
ing the Aeronautical Engineering
Department 10 per cent of the
I.C. acedemic budget to build its
own Concorde. And likewise
much effort is spent by those who
are active in manoeuvring: to
defeat the rugby club or to defeat
the politicians. And much effort
is devoted to raising constituent
college morale by methods more
reminiscent of pre-wai Nurem-
berg rallies. All highly entertain-
ing for those who take part. But
those who don't like being man-
oeuvred aren't being brought in
from the cold. And like Len
Deighton's hero, they probably
won't make it over the wall.
WELLS...
I a n W e l l s :
a s p i r i t e d M i n e r
Born in Yorkshire in 1945 Ian Wells graduated after 11 hazard-
ous years at primary school to Bridlington grammar . After this
auspicious start he arrived at IC with an enormousfizzin 1963 to read
Metallurgy.
Having had 2J relatively quiet years at College he 'rose rapidly
to prominence towards the end of his course and was only narrowly
defeated in the 1966 Presidential elections by Chris Molam. By last
year, however, he was sofirmlyestablished in Mines that he took the
Presidency uncontested.
"Presidents should be
much more
than just a figurehead."
O'DONNELL...
The question of behaviour
in the bar
concerns him
By becoming president fan has
fulfilled his ambition. But this
does not mean that he is now
going to relax. He believes that a
President should be much more
than just afigureheadand he is
proud of the relationship that
exists between himself and the
other members of Mines. This
kind of relationship, he reasons,
can only exist in a union as small
and as compact as Mines, a
t

<
that it helps to create what he
terms the " spirit" of Mines
Union.
On the administrative side of
his job Ian believes that a Presi-
dent should not necessarily form
all the policies of his Union, but
should work with and represent
f l
.ishes of his committee as a
*:
".jie He would like to see a
;.rger emphasis put on the separ-
ate unions of Imperial college and
is afraid that at the mwwent too
much life is formed around the
individual halls of residence.
On controversial subjects such
as politics lan refuses to be
drawn, and says that a Union
should be in no way affiliated
with such things, except where
they have a direct bearing on stu-
dents (as in the matter of govern-
ment loans to students). On the
question of parking Jan says that
Union members must be realistic
and sec that they are not the only
ones in London being inconveni-
enced, although he hopes that a
solution to the problem can be
found
Ian Wells is the type of person
who believes that you can only
get out of life what you put into
it. Will he spend all his available
time to make Mines an even bet-
ter union than it is now? " Quite
definitely," he says.
Any graduate who joins
the police should have his
brainstested.
And believe us,
he does.
Manytimes
a day.
Don Smith is a top executive in the Metropolitan Police.
A Superintendent at 34 he now commands over 200 men
and women, including C.I.D. men, administrators and civilians.
Today at 36 his total income is £2855
There's a quiet revolution going on in the
police service. You may have noticed it. But
it's not just things like new equipment or better
pay. It's a whole series of fundamental changes
aimed at meeting the challenge of the next
decade.
The intellectual demands of a police career begin
from the moment you join. You need to be something
of a lawyer. A psychologist. A quick thinker. And very
often a diplomat. The first two years are vital prepar-
ation for the time when you could command hundreds
of police, detectives, fingerprint-experts, technicians-
and equipment worth many thousands. It's a world of
new ideas in which the man of ability is expected to take
executive responsibility much earlier than in industry.
New deal for Graduates.
For the first time the police have introduced a special
scheme of entry for graduates. It aims to attract young
men who have the education and character to rise
quickly to command-level with big responsibilities —
and pay to match. You can find out before you commit
yourself to join whether you have the potential to rise
above the rank of Inspector early in your career. Two-
day special interviews to select up to 20 such grad-
uates will be held in the second week of January 1968.
We should expect you to gain your first promotion in
your third year, spend a year at the Police College, and
become an Inspector in your fifth year.
If you are leaving university in 1968 think about a
police career now. Join at 21 and you step into the,
£1,000-a-year class right away. Post this coupon today.
