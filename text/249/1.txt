Frank Fuchs,
Freeze raises
Refectory loss
College
refund
may
As reported in the last issue of
FELIX, the Refectories made
a loss last year of £6,500
compared with the previous
year's loss of £160. It is
to avoid incurring a similar
loss this year that the prices for
Mooney's meals have been raised
(3d. for main courses and 2d. for
sweets in the lower refectory and
6d. for sweets in the upper re-
fectories). This represents a rise
of 8-9 per cent, but the prices for
external meals, that is, meals dur-
ing the vac. will be raised by 10-
i5 per cent.
The increases should bring an
extra £13,000 which will cover
last year's loss plus an anticipated
deficit of £5,000 this year, thus
giving an overall profit of about
£1,500. It is hoped that this profit
will enable prices to be kept
stable over the next few years, so
there is no immediate intention of
raising prices still further.
Mr. Mooney, the Refectories
Manager, stated that as last year's
deficit was mainly a result of hav-
ing to keep prices down because
of the freeze, the College authori-
ties may be able to refund all or
part of it. He also said that there
was no question, as has been sug-
gested, of Bar profits subsidising
the Refectories loss, as last year's
Bar profits were only £72.

One post on the L C executive, that of the R.CJS. President,
is as yet unfilled. George Hulme, who would have taken up the posi-
this year, failed his finals and resigned at the beginning of this term.
Two candidates for the post have now definitely emerged from the
nomination sheet: Bob Mackman and Frank Fuchs.
Mackman is at present R.C.S. Secretary; Fuchs was George
Hulmes defeated opponent in last- year's election campaign. Both
contenders have strong claims to the post, and both have firm areas
of support inside R.C.S.: both have long records of involvement
with R.C.S. and with I.C. Union.
A third year Physics under-
graduate, Bob Mackman's main
achievements to date have been
in changing courses of lectures
and lessons all throueh his aca-
demic career. At secondary
modern school he persuaded the
staff to introduce O-level chemis-
try into the curriculum. Next, in
the sixth form at grammar school
he managed to change the science
timetable to accommodate the
course of A-levels he was taking.
Dormant in his first year at I.C.,
he became departmental rep. for
Physics in his second year, and
proceeded to campaign for the
introduction of a Management
Studies course. This idea was the
fruit of the Physics staff-student
committee which he instigated last
year after a questionnaire that he
circulated to discover the opinions
of Physics students on the course
they were taking. He was awarded
R.C.S. social colours last year,
mainly for setting-up the staff-
student committee.
In the same field, the R.C.S.
constitution has now been
changed, at his instigation, to ac-
commodate an Academic Officer
to continue work on improving
R.C.S. courses. It appears that
he would be a generally popular
and approachable President.
A nuclear physics P.G., Frank
Fuchs, has in the past aroused
extremes of emotion in people,
both those prepared to slander
him ad lib, and those who con-
sider he would make " one of the
best Presidents RC.S. has ever
had." He has had a somewhat
turbulent career in seven years in
student affairs, having threatened
to sue Colcutt, having been,
among other things, chairman of
the I.C. Communist Society,
editor of " Sennet," and U.L.U.
Social Vice-President, and having
resigned each of these posts pre-
maturely after " differences of
policy." He has a reputation as
an " ideas man."
in union affairs; there is a good
deal of similarity in what each
says. But Mackman's overriding
interest would be on the academic
side, in following up the intro-
duction of the Management
Studies course, which he regards
as only thefirststep. And Fuchs
plans to improve R.C.S. as a
community and as a distinct col-
lege union, by introducing an
R.C.S. newsletter and an "R.C.S.
open day," whose purpose would
be, among other things, to attract
more girls to the College (a
worthy example of long-term
planning).
Mackman
favourite
Whether R.C.S. will get all it
is promised is possibly another
story, but surely it can at least im-
prove on last year's record, when
only 30 per cent of the College
turned up to the ballot box. A
survey of 100 students in the
Chemistry Department last week
showed that 65 of them intended
to vote—28 for Mackman, 9 for
Fuchs, and 23 as yet undecided.
The other 35 per cent claimed to
be totally disinterested, but it
looks as if the issue is still very
open. In the name of democracy:
VOTE!
The election is by general ballot
on Monday 23rd, and the result
will be announced at an R.C.S.
Union meetina on the 24th.
Policies:
Involvement &
Academics
George Hulme was elected last
year without, apparently, the help
of any election promises; but this
year the situation is different, in
that both candidates have pro-
duced a set of policies they intend
to follow if elected. Both would
like to increase R.C.S. links with
the Royal College of Art, to press
for larger postgraduate grants, to
press for better student parking
facilities,, to involve people more
Chris Palmer
elected to
Carnival
At last Friday's meeting of the
Carnival Board Chris Palmer was
finally elected this year's Carnival
Co-ordinator. The appointment
was made as an unanimous deci-
sion after the other candidates
for the post had stood down. The
actual charity has yet to be
chosen, but Chris, a second-year
Minesman, commented that he
favoured a large well-known one,
capable of appealing directly to
the general public, rather an in-
ternal I.C. cause. He added that
it was unfortunate that Rollo
Green had failed. Rollo Green
was, in fact, due to be this year's
Co-ordinator.

Freshers Hop Improved
The first Saturday of term once again brought the Freshers' Hop,
with 1984, Marshall Scott, etc., and the Kynde playing to over a thou-
sand students in a packed and perspiring Union Building.
This year, as opposed to last, everything went smoothly. All
three groups turned Up and played with enthusiasm to an audience so
responsive that, at times, to weave one's way through the gyrating and
genuflecting masses was a feat almost on a par with clearing a path to
the crowded bar. Reactions were mixed, but on the whole apprecia-
tive, varying from the odd group of slightly bewildered freshers silently
nodding appreciation under the multicoloured lights to the undistin-
guished ex-member of the Union who stood amid the twisting bodies
and blew a. gentle, but distinct, raspberry.
Keith Guy, the Chairman of
Ents, to whom credit must be
given for the organisation, which
was a dramatic improvement on
Mutiny in
the Bar
On Sunday, 8th October, the
first weekend of term, the Union
bar was closed all the evening.
The only bar open in the Union
was in the Lower lounge, and
here the new high prices for
drinks (2/2 for bitter) were being
charged.
The official reason for this was
that there was insufficient change
for two tills (one in each bar) to
be in use, and since there had
been a special request for the
lower lounge bar to be open for
the Sunday night Folk and Jazz
session, the staff decided to open
this bar. Consequently the main
bar doors were locked, thus pre-
venting anyone from playing darts
or shove Ha'penny, and forcing
everyone to pay 2d. per pint
extra.
Martin Lack did try to get the
Union bar opened and the low
prices charged in the Lower
Lounge. However, Howard, the
chief barman, forcibly refused to
comply, although Lack theoreti-
cally had the authority to order
these changes. Martin com-
mented, " Howard is a very diffi-
cult person to get on with," and
he added, " this was one of the
nastiest experiences I have ever
had."
When asked about the incident,
Mr. Mooney, who is ultimately
responsible for the bars, replied
that it was an unfortunate occur-
rence and that positive steps were
being taken to ensure that the
.situation. did not recur.
last year's, was extremely pleased
with the hop and claimed a profit
of about £200. Some confusion
was caused at the beginning, due
to Martin Lack omitting to publi-
cise the fact that the Union would
be closed while the hop was on,
but this was soon cleared up
before the majority of people ar-
rived.
Re Colcutt
Following Collcutt's unfortu-
nately misleading information in
the last issue of Felix about the
pruning of numbers in the Physics
department due solely to the lack
of space, Professor Wright and
other members of the teaching
staff have been privately reassur-
ing the students concerned that
this is not the case. The number
of students admitted each year is
decided by the Educational
Grants Committee. IC accepts
approximately this number and
the department then sets about
accommodating them.
There is no question of the 3rd
year being cut down until they
can be fitted in the smaller lec-
ture "theatres, holding 120. This
session, for the first time, all three
undergraduate years are having
their lectures in the main lecture
theatre (seating 250), the only
difficulty being slight timetable
alterations.
Professor Wright also rejected
wholeheartedly the idea that stu-
dents who do leave are " thrown
on the rubbish heap." Dr. Pain
personally follows up the fate of
all of them, and most go to other
colleges throughout the country.
