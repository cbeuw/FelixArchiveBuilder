6 FELIX
Ent in, Turn on,
Hop out.
In the beginning was the dream, and the dream dwelt amongst
i.C.'s enlightened few, and this was of an I.C. witched on, of hops
you wanted to go to, an involved pipe dream i refectories turned
discotheque, name groups and beautiful girls.
But beneath the angelic strain rolled on 10,000 Ents Committees
who were too bothered about which society was . >ing to assimilate
the profits from their next hop to worry about changing things. And
so the dream lingered on
And then there arose in the land a mighty Ents Committee, 30
in all, and great was the movement in that land. And the dream
became flesh, and it was called the Plastic Fairytale, and it came to
dwell in the midst of all, in the Upper Refectory put it down roots, this
is the storv and of the minds it will blow . . .
The Plastic Fairytale dream is

of a Friday night discotheque
within the Union, with light-
sound show to rival UFO and
Middle Earth, brain cancellation
perpetrated amid the purple haze
of an inter-galactic environment.
I digress—the dream is almost
material, the baptism is set for
Oct. 27th if all goes well. From
then on every Friday (and pos-
sibly Monday also).
The lucky few who become
members will at last be able to
turn on within the hallowed walls
of I.C Union. The planned name
for thi discotheque is the Plastic
Fairytale, although this could
change before opening day. The
music will be loud, the light ad-
jectivally indescribable, and the
involvement total.
Immediate plans involve wild
decoration with aluminium foil-
covered walls,fluorescentdraw-
ings, ultra-violet illumination and
a white drop curtain covering the
end wall, to be used as a screen
for various fiendish light ma-
chines. With the music piped
from a discotheque at approxi-
mately 60 watts, instant disorien-
tation is readily available to all.
Membership will be severely
limited; all members will have to
be seconded by two other mem-
bers. "This," said Ents Chair-
man Keith Guy "will enable us to
restrict membership to the type
of person who really appreciates
this kind of entertainment, not
those who come along just for a
giggle." This definitely excludes
the hard drinking jumper-and-
jeans crowd who will find that
hard drinks have been thrown
firmly in the " out" tray.
Many voices will, no doubt,
be raised in protest at the
apparent cliquishness of the
whole affair, but Ents argue
that, as the discotheque does not
interfere with existing facilities, it
should be allowed to function for
the type of person for whom it
was created (as are the Links, 22
and Chaps Clubs) without inter-
ference from those who could
spoil it (Keith Guy warns of in-
stant excommunication for mem-
bers who cause trouble, and of a
blacklist for those who seconded
Future plans for the Plastic
Fairytale are as inviting as they
are unfeasible. Certainly it will
take a lot of effort to produce the
giant paper-and-fibreglass flowers
with which Keith Guy hopes to
obliterate the unsightly ceiling,
and to make the cosy alcoves he
proposes for the corners of the
room, but the whole project will
stand or fall on the amount of
work put in by those in charge.
It is hoped to provide a buffet in
addition to soft drinks and lager,
with, possibly, music provided by
a resident group in the foresee-
able future. Another pipe-dream
is closed circuit T V to show the
narks outside just what they are
missing.
Way Out Hops
If the plans for the Plastic Fairy
tale are ambitious, no less so are
thpse for future Hop. After a
profitable, if not memorable,
Freshers' Hops, Ents have an am-
bitious programme for future
events. Entertainers, booked or
virtually booked for the near fu-
ture include : Ben E. King, Crazy
World of Arthur Brown, Marma-
lade, Zoot Money (with light
show as well as Big Roll Band),
Dantalion's Chariot and Picture
of Dorian Gray , also approached
are Amen Corner, The Peddlars
and John's Children, although the
last named may be ruled out as
just too way out.
It seems a pity that Ents should
be bound to farm out the Hops
so that different societies can line
their pockets from them. If the
Hops are to be worthwhile, surely
they must be considered as events
in their own right, and not as
money-making institutions for
clubs and societies. This bleed-
ing of resources must stop before
really good line-ups are possible
for the Hops.
Incidentally, the word " Hop "
is right out; all events in future, it
is hoped, will have different
names from week to week. For
instance, the Harlington fireworks
display becomes, " Explosion is
Nov 5th!!" Traditionalists
please note.
Space
Ents name their biggest prob-
lem as that of available space.
For years it has been obvious that
the Concert Hall is too small for
a big dance and Chairman Guy
talks with a faraway look in his
eyes of the day when the Union
Gym becomes redundant and it
may be possible to double the size
of the Concert Hall, albeit at the
cost of a couple of walls. More
practical solutions are on the way,
however, the first being a joint
rave with Regent Street Polytech-
nic, using their excellent facilities,
next month. Tentative future
plans include the use of the union
quad in summer and hiring public
halls.
And so the dream unfolds,
Jacques Robinson, Gordon Sage
and Bill Bailey are in charge of
making the Plastic Fairytale a
success. They, and M. Smith are
producing some excellent graphic
work to advertise it, and a cast
too great to mention are all busy
putting the show on the road. It
is now up to the 3500 other mem-
bers of I.C. to see that they suc-
ceed.
