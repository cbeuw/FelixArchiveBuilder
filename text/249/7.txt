FELIX 7
C o l l c u t t T o w e r
The figure of
given to FELIX
It's IXl's answer to the Leaning Tower of Pisa ; its the master-
piece of the most revered correspondent on FELIX; it has been
vigorously acclaimed and savagely condemned for its architectural
•merits and demerits; and the sum of £203,000 is to be spent over the
next year in propping it up. What is this building ? It can only be
that monument of great notoriety, CoDcurt's Tower.
£203,000 was
_ by Mr. Fair-
clough of the Planning Board re-
sponsible for the new College
Block area. Of this, £175,000
goes on the tower alone—in re-
pairing it—and the remainder
on providing a concrete podium
for it to stand on, and a lawn
around this. Propping up the
tower has been made necessary
by the demolition of all the
buildings adjoining it—the old
Imperial Institute—and is on a
fairly large scale. The original
base of the tower was a solid
concrete bed some 25 feet thick
and the base walls were 9 feet
thick. Both walls and base are
being strengthened—the walls by
an internal concrete sheath, the
base by a number of piles driven
about it. with an enormous ring
beam which is being incorporated
with these.
M a g n i f i c e n t
Monument?
But Thomas Collcutt's brain-
child was not always so secure. In
1956 those planning for the new
College Block very nearly passed
a plan to demolish it—which
many might call a public service.
The plan was eventually altered
to incorporate it as a free-stand-
ing campanile. This was largely
the work of noted poet John Bet-
jeman, who so stirred the House
of Lords and the residents of
Kensington that the tower was
kept, while the buildings all about
it were destroyed. These build-
ings were originally the Imperial
Institute, a Commonwealth mu-
seum, whose foundation stone
was laid by Queen Victoria; the
Institute was paid for by public
subscription and the whole thing
was of sentimental value, if no-
thing else.
Suitably enhanced by oratory,
this sentiment was one of the key
arguments in the lengthy House
of Lords debate on the subject.
The remainder makes interesting
reading : " . . . this great work of
Collcutt . . .", ". . the jewel-
like quality of the detail of Coll-
cutt's building . . " The oppos-
ing argument was, in effect, the
more new buildings there were
for I.C. students the better, and
the more demolition, the more
new buildings for I.C. students.
But this did not win the day. In
fairness it should be added that to
demolish the tower would cost
at least £25,000, it being of sound
construction; so sentiment was
not the only consideration. That
debate was 11 years ago ; jewel-
like quality or not, the tower will
be with I.C. for many more years
to come.
Friday night jazz
o f f t o g o o d s t a r t
Alexis Korner
The first event in the I.C. Jazz
calendar was Friday nig'it's con-
cert held in co-operation with the
Folk Club, in which Alexis
Korner and the Tubby Hayes
quartet played to a packed
house in the Union Concert Hall.
The concert was opened by
Alexis Korner. He played mainly
conventional blues including free
adaptations of songs by Joe
Turner, Robert Johnson, Duffy
Power, Muddy Waters and King
Oliver. He also played some
original pieces including an im-
personation of a Boogie piano
player. He accompanied himself
mainly on the electric guitar
which demonstrated his great
talent to the best advantage in the
concert hall. His own comment
that his " intention was often
greater than the ability " was far
from true and he treated the au-
dience to a highly entertaining
and accomplished performance.
He was followed by the Tubby
Hayes Quartet. Tubby gave a
sparkling performance on tenor
and also on flute. He was very
ably supported by bass player
Ron Matheson, Tubby's great
discovery from the Shetland Isles,
who seemed to make the double
bass talk during his solo; the
^sneciallv brilliant playing of
drummer Tony Levin together
with the superb harmonic inge-
nuity of pianist Mike Pine com-
bined to produce the sound ack-
nowledged as absolutely top rate
both here and in America.
After the interval Alexis again
played with the brilliance he had
shown in the first half and was
well received by the audience
who recalled him for an encore.
Tubby Hayes rounded off the
concert with a less lively but none
the less enjoyable performance.
The concert was a great success
and it is hoped that future Jazz
and Folk club sessions follow this
pattern.
For fresher folk fans who pre-
fer a more informal atmosphere
for their " folk," club sessions
are usually held in the Upper
refectory every other Wednesday
Here well-known artists play
alongside College performers.
Friday night jazz sessions will be-
come a regular feature, with big
name bands this term. The next
concert is on Friday October 20,
with the Alan Elsdon Band, ex-
perts of traditional jazz on the
British scene. Amateur College
performers who wish to show off
their talents can perform at the
informal Sunday evening sessions
of Jazz and Folk in the Union
Lounge.
ICWords
Knobbly Knees
This year I.C. admitted 70
women freshers. This means a
record number of women under-
graduates—159 in all. The num-
bers of postgraduates arc as yet
unknown but the total number
of women should topple the 200
mark. However, with recent
trends away from science in the
sixth forms it is unlikely that the
numbers of women will increase
to any great extent.
Owing to circumstances beyond
his control, Andy Powell, last
year's Mr. ICWA, has failed to
return to College and this means
a re-election. Nomination papers
will be posted on the ICWA
notice board, so if you know
someone in the College with the
knobbliest knees who would make
a good Mr. *ICWA—nominate
him soon! Elections will take
place at the next general meeting
of ICWA. Although there is to
be no ICWA party at which these
elections can take place, I am told
that the knobbly knees contest
will still be held. Likely candi-
dates are as yet unknown, but ru-
mour has it that Pete Franklin, of
Third year Chemistry, will be
standing again.
Mixed Rugby
Do you fell like wallowing in
two feet of mud, wearing a rugger
shirt 10 sizes too big and defend-
ing a goal against 15 " husky "
men? Then volunteer for the
ICWA rugby team—Guilds have
challenged ICWA to a match
even though the odds seem a little
unfair; there are hoped to be 30
Icwarians in the team. No doubt
there will be ample compensation
for the mud and bruises after-
wards at the Harlington Bar!
