There I was at four in the
morning, yet again berating
myself for allocating two pages
for sport during this, the sum-
mer term, when obviously all
students are inside all day,
when suddenly, like an angel
from Heaven, a freak shaft of
lightning hit Felix towers, trav-
elled down the mains line to
my computer, and by some
miracle allowed my computer
to intercept an e-mail that was
bound for the BBC sports desk.
So here it is, hot from the press:
a report on the latest new
sport to sweep the world.
Enjoy! - Ed.
Welcome one, and welcome
all, to the exciting new world
of sofa surfing. This sport sees
teams of fat slobs vying for a
chance to w i n the fabled
Goblet Of Lard, as well as a
Playstation, and a multi-pur-
pose remote control.
Sofa Surfing
The game itself is like bingo,
but instead of numbers, one
has to collect words, chosen
from the vocabulary of our fair
language by a panel of experts
who have nothing better to do.
The teams, each of three play-
ers, then have five cable tele-
visions, but only two remote
controls, and they have to use
wit, cunning, and team work
to zap between various chan-
nels to collect the 'hot' words
from the mindless effluence of
waffle that emanates from
their goggle-boxes.
However, all this must be
done while drinking Special
Brew at the rate of a can every
half hour, and eating crisps at
the rate of a jumbo bag of sea-
salt kettle chips every twenty
minutes, and obviously you
must never rise from your sofa,
which clearly imposes a natu-
ral time limit.
The first professional match
ever played was between the
Suffolk Sloths and the
Gloucestershire Gluttons.
The match started well,
with both teams finding the
word 'salubrious' in the same
five minutes, on two different
channels, thanks to the BBCs
obsession w i t h Jeremy
Paxman. However the game
waned after that, and with
only 'gallant' missing from the
Gluttons bag, and 'musty'
from the Sloths, a fight broke
out between the Suffolk team
when one member wanted to
see what happened at the end
of Star Trek, and another
spoiled it for him, informing
him that they went back in
time in a space hole to fix the
problem with superglue. The
excitement proved too much,
and they forfeited through lack
of bladder control.
The next match was
between the London Louts
and the Yorkshire Yobs, and
this game started well until
yells of 'Northern Donkey' and
'Southern Pansy' broke the
concentration of the referee,
who was trying to w a t c h
Neighbours, who promptly
disqualified everyone for pre-
venting him finding out who
Toadfish was shagging.
Therefore only one team
went through into the Grand
Final, and this was the
Gluttons. However, foolishly,
and perhaps due to over-confi-
dence (since you must com-
plete the challenge to win,
regardless of opposition), they
started slow, enjoying a full
episode of the Good Life, and
had to admit defeat for sani-
tary reasons, while, ironically,
still searching for the word
'chicken'.
