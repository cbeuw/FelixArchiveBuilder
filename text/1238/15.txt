Runs, Wickets and Cups of Tea
It is typically the case with the
cricket season that the rain
only comes the day before the
games, and this year has been
no exception. The first two
games were both washed out,
despite glorious sunshine on
the day of the game, by heavy
rain the day before and the
inability of groundsmen to
read the weather forecast.
However, the season got
underway for the IC 2nd XI
against RUMS 2nd's on
Sunday the 12th May. The
preparations didn't begin as
planned, with one of the play-
ers forgetting that we actually
had a game and Pete being
drafted in, still the worse for
wear from the night before. We
eventually arrived (no thanks
to the Union, who had provid-
ed a bus that left a trail of oil
for us to follow on the journey
back), only a little late, and our
skipper Gopi was persuaded
into batting first, if he won the
toss, by an opener very keen
to score some runs.
He duly won the toss, we bat-
ted and the opener, Spuggy,
got 46 before managing to hit
the ball to one of the only play-
ers in the RUMS side who
could catch. The other opener
had already made his way
back to the hutch, bringing a
very timid Shagnasty to the
wicket. He began very slowly,
showing that a good batsmen
must use all of the willow pro-
vided, before he began smash-
ing the very mediocre bowling
all over the field, hitting a six
to bring up both his fifty and
hundred. Gopi also got 31, but
was beaten to third highest
score by the extras, who were
helped out by bowlers who
couldn't aim straight. Karan,
yes that is his name, Rob and
Tom, helped bring the total to
246 for 5 from 32.3 overs,
before their captain persuaded
us to end their misery and
declare.
After a very nice tea, which
was most appreciated by
Spuggy, we set out onto the
field to bowl. We soon discov-
ered that they couldn't bat
very well either, w i t h only
three of their batsmen getting
double-figure scores.
Everyone bowled well, with
Spuggy and Tom picking up
two wickets each, and Gopi
and a very excitable Hanut
taking three wickets apiece. A
mention must go to Pete who
bowled extremely well given
rest of the batting line up
would not have looked out of
place in England's 1st innings
at Lords' last week, and
rumour has it that some of the
IC middle order batsmen have
been called into the England
squad for the second test at
Edgbaston. However, our cap-
tain had decided to leave his
secret weapons at the bottom
of the order, Irish Pete (We did-
n't know they played cricket in
Ireland) and Metronome (57
not out) putting on 100 for the
8th wicket, rescuing us from a
his problems focussing on the
stumps at the other end. We
had bowled RUMS out for 114,
giving us a comprehensive
w i n by 132 runs.
The following Wednesday saw
both the 1st and 2nd XI's in
action, against U C L lst's and
LSE respectively. The 1st XI
were expecting an easy w i n
against a 'weakened' U C L
side, we were told they would
have to pick some women,
which actually contained a
ULU squad member, one more
than the IC side. Our captain,
Pumpman, won the toss and
decided to bat, and being cap-
tain decided to open the bat-
ting himself, along with Tom
Sterling. The pair started well,
both players getting into the
20's before getting out. The
monu-fucking-mental disaster.
However, Pete got out for 43,
bringing James to the crease,
only for him to walk back one
ball later. Most of the team
thought he had cracked one
through the covers for four, but
the more eagle-eyed specta-
tors saw that he had in fact
stood on his own wicket as
well, Kwality! After, the mid-
dle-order collapse a score of
190 after 40 overs was a rea-
sonable total.
After the tea-break the wild-
west bowling partnership,
Jesse/James, opened the
bowling. They both started
well, with James picking up
his wicket second-ball and
Metronome making Glenn
McGrath look wayward.
Despite some poor field place-
ment by the skipper, several
shots went through the slips
at catchable height, Pete and
Pumpman, he must have got
the fielders in the right place
for his own bowling, took
three wickets each. Tom
Hodgson also got a wicket and
Marcus avoided the Thanks-
for-Coming prize by claiming a
wicket as well. This reduced
UCL to 95 all out, a w i n by 95
runs.
The 2nd XI were due to play a
fairly strong LSE side, but U L U
had pinched a couple of their
players on the morning of the
game, so we knew it would be
a close match. Our side batted
first, and after a slow start by
Hussain, no relation to the
England skipper, and Mike
(30), Gopi (67 not out) and
Julian (38) helped themselves
to the buffet bowling. Suraj,
Karan and Muhammad all
helped to get the side up to
209 for 5 from 40 overs.
The 2nd XI set about their task
of bowling LSE out with great
determination, Hanut and
Damien, who is more famous
for his command of the ball
while batting, both picking up
a wicket. In fact none of the
bowlers disgraced them-
selves, everyone took a wick-
et, but unfortunately the game
proved to be a lot closer than
we'd have liked. LSE scored
the winning runs with four
balls left in the innings. This
defeat meant that LSE, and
not IC 2nd's would progress
into the knockout stages of the
UL Cup.
The 1st XI still wait to hear
their fate, which looks likely to
be decided by the calculator of
Becky Fawcett at ULU, if she
decides to come back from hol-
iday in time anyway. Group A
will almost certainly be decid-
ed by the run rate, since three
teams look likely to finish on 4
points each.
