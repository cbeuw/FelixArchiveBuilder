Rector sends PM warning
Sir Richard Sykes has called
for the creation of a group of
elite universities to make
Britain a world leader in sci-
ence education.
In an interview with the
Financial Times published this
week, the College's Rector -
who is a member of the
Council for Science and
Technology set up by the
Government, and was recently
appointed a member of the
new science policy strategy
board of the Department for
Trade and Industry - called for
the establishment of twelve
universities that would be free
to charge students tuition fees
at market rates that could
exceed £10,000 each year.
This, he believes, would
enable the British higher edu-
cation system to attract the
best students from around the
globe by offering "the best
conditions in the world."
His words were seen as a
warning to the Prime Minister,
Tony Blair, who only last week
told the Royal Society in
London that he wants "to
make sure the UK is one of the
best places in the world to do
science." Sir Richard respond-
ed by claiming that it would
be impossible to have "a suc-
cessful science and technolo-
gy policy without first tackling
the universities... the govern-
ment has to concentrate on
the tertiary education system,
which is in trouble, and do
something radical."
Referring to the inflexible
funding system currently in
place, he allegedly told the FT
"we have to compete interna-
tionally with one hand tied
behind our back."
While Sir Richard conceded
that the idea of elite universi-
ties would be difficult to pro-
mote on a political level, espe-
cially to wealthier parents
who would bear much of the
financial burden of the propos-
als, he allegedly justified his
plans to charge up to ten
times the tuition fees currently
paid by students at British
universities by saying that
"middle class people pay a lot
of money to send their chil-
dren to private schools from
three to eighteen and then
they rail at the idea of paying
for tertiary education." It is
thought that students from
poorer backgrounds would be
supported through their time
at these universities through a
scheme of means-tested
scholarships.
Throughout all of this, how-
ever, College officials have
insisted that Sir Richard has
been misquoted, and assure
students that the Rector will
discuss this issue with them
in the near future. John S

Obituary
It is my sad duty to inform you
of the recent passing of Jim
"Jungle Jim" Chapman, follow-
ing a short battle with cancer.
Jim was a member of the IC
Men's IVs Hockey team for
longer than any of the current
players and, despite living
some distance from college,
continued to play an active
role in the team. He went on
the club tour to South Africa
last summer, and was due to
go to Barbados on tour this
summer. He showed incredi-
ble commitment to the team
for many years and was a
friendly presence on numer-
ous social events. He will be
greatly missed by everyone in
the club, and especially those
in the IV team. The IV team
has a website on which there
is a tribute section to Jim. If
anyone would like their trib-
utes added, please e-mail
them to:
