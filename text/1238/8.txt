Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
40
You get a first, and
everyone thinks you're
boring and geeky. You'll
become old and grey,
wear sandles, and even
your friends will call you
'The Professor'...

Trivia
Do you know who the
second man in space
was? If you do, you're
clever: go to 16. If not,
you're dumb. Go to 25.
Union, Evening

Wednesday Wotsits
By a process of osmosis,
you end up at the Union,
dancing to silly songs,
and you wake up with a
hangover. Watch TV. (21)
Union, All Night
37
Well, frankly you can
piss off then. Nobody
thinks you're big or
clever. In fact we refer to
you as grand-dad
behind your back and
make rude gestures.

Dolly Mixtures
You and your friends go
to the Union, have a lit-
tle drink, and you meet
someone nice, who likes
you too! Happy ending!
Union, All Night

You are at Uni. You can

Alternative Music
You are too old and bor-
ing. You should never
have gone to work. You
die of internal trauma.
Da Vincis, 5pm
35
For years you go every
week to watch the hills
sound of music, and one
day you realise that you
are in fact Julie
Andrews. Good effort.
26
You go to the Union to
try and find something
else to do, have a few
drinks, and meet some
friends. They persuade
you to stay on for the
evening. Go to 36.
25
Ah. Stoopid. But are you
friends with the winner?
If you are, stick around
(16), but if not, follow
some of your mates. I
think they're going club-
bing... (20)
24
Not the worst way to
spend your life, but a bit
dull. Oh well, you meet
some nice guys who you
can go out with of an
evening, and life ain't
too bad, really.
23
So one night you decide
to go out with some of
your friends at Imperial.
But what are you going
to do? Drink? (6), Music?
(34), or perhaps some
Trivia? (39)
22
Drink drink drink drink
drink. Doesn't that
sound a bit boring to
you? Are you sure that's
all there is to life? Are
you positive? If so, 11,
but if not, 5.

you can salvage the rest
of the evening. Is it

Sky One, 5pm
12
Hmm, what to do now?
It's getting to the time in
the evening where you
have to make decisions.
Are you going to go
home (29), or have a
drink with friends? (24)
11
You wake up dead one
day in a ditch, your
trousers round your
ankles, and a dog sitting
on your face. Although I
have to say that you did
die happy...
10
You may have a job, but
you can still have a
social life (just). For
instance, do you still
have any friends at Uni?
If so, go to 23, but if not,
then go to box 19.
Hmm, you are difficult to
please, aren't you? Is
there anything social
that you like to do? If so,
then go to 36, but if you
just want to sit around
and drink, go to 24.
A friend suggests you
go and watch Boo at
Underworld, and after
some thought you agree,
but once you're there,
does it rock (26), or does
it leave you cold? (17)
Fan enough You make
ome money, meet a
nice girl, settle down,
get married, have some
fear of anonymity and
die. S

hope for you. There's so
much more^to life! You
could go out and do
somef low does
some music strike you?
Yes? (31) Ng, Drink! (14)
Oh dear. You do love
your alcohol, don't you?
Have you drunk too
much to move (42), or
can you actually still
move your legs to go to
the cinema? (27)
But is it all you like? Are
you so one track mind-
ed? Surely something
else tickles your fancy?
If so, go to box 26, but if
not, then your destiny is
