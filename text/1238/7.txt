this week
Editorial
Oh my God. That was like, the
most stressful diary ever. Last
week's was positively a
dream compared to this one. I
had to apply brain and every-
thing for this one. Oh well.
So, what's been going on, I
hear you ask. Well to start
with, those of you who read
the letters page may have
noticed that last week I said
that we weren't going to have
anything more on the
Palestine-Israel debate, as
well as no more on the NUS
debate. Strangely I've had six
or seven letters continuing
one, but not the other. I'll let
you guess which. So to solve
the problem of representing
student views without turn-
ing Felix into a private forum, I
am going to be organising a
debate between the various
different protagonists for
some time in the next few
weeks before term ends. I will
then attend this debate (but
not mediate it: that will be
someone else), and write it up
as a feature for the final issue
of term. I hope this provides a
reasonable solution for every-
one, especially me. Look out
for publicity over the next few
weeks.
Apart from all this I have
the bloody Alternative
Prospectus to sort out, as well
as a handbook, so anyone
who thinks this job is easy
can kindly come and take over
from me before I have a nerv-
ous breakdown, and possible
a brain haemorrhage.
Respect, incidentally, is due
to all of you who have exams
this week, and all other
weeks, for that matter. I was
just trying to help a first year
friend of mine with her maths
the other day: I have done four
years of Physics, and I still
had absolutely no idea what
was going on, so I think that
either the quality of degree
has gone up, or the quality of
my brain has gone down.
Either way, I'm impressed.
Um. Sex? Usually an inter-
esting subject, but I'm afraid
it's all been a bit quiet on that
front lately. I haven't fallen for
anyone grossly unsuitable
(except perhaps for a mild age
gap) recently, and when I saw
another ex-girlfriend this
weekend (because my life is
that exciting), it was all fairly
easy and none too stressful,
and we didn't even do any-
thing stupid.
So on to pastures new, I
suppose. Maybe I'll find some
way to spice up my life, but
I'm not sure I can deal with
any extra stress, so maybe I'll
just make the most of some
me-time, as I think the
Americans say. That's not to
say that I'm not welcoming
any advances, ladieeees.
Hehehe. Come up and see my
snake, etc. Oh arse, I can't be
bothered. I'm going to bed. On
my own. Now.
Whoops, forgot about the
other four pages of Felix I've
go to do first. So much for me
time.

While you're not hard-
core enough to die just
yet, you'll probably
become an alcoholic,
alienate all your friends,
and wake up one day,
alone in your own vomit.

Oooh, world cup fever.
Beckham scores with his
dodgy foot, and Owen
nicks one in past the
French. Hurrah! After a
game like that, it's time
to go clubbing. (20)
