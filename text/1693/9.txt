Searching for a match: could you be Kaiya’s stem cell
donor?
Kaiya was diagnosed with leukaemia six weeks ago, and is still looking for a donor – her family are desparately
appealing to South Asian people to join the register and help find a match.

hen the
parents of
five-year-
old Kaiya
took her to the doctors
following some bruising,
they weren’t expecting to
hear anything out of the
ordinary. Instead, they
returned home with the
news that their daughter
had leukaemia.
Kaiya, who was
diagnosed a little over
six weeks ago, is one of
the roughly 400 children
who are diagnosed with
Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukaemia (ALL) in
the UK each and every
year. Now, after several
weeks of chemotherapy,
invasive procedures, and
testing, she is in desper-
ate need of a stem cell
transplant. Unfortunately,
her family hasn’t been
able to provide a match,
and now are appealing to
the general public to help
them find one.
ALL is a form of blood
cancer. While it can
affect people of any age,
it predominates in those
between two and five
years of age, with three
quarters of cases occuring
in those under the age of
six.
While the cause is
unknown, there are a
number of different
factors that can lead to
the development of ALL;
genetic factors are those
most closely associated
with the disease, and in
Kaiya’s case a genetic
abnormality has been

Europeans. This means
that when children like
Kaiya are in need, it can
be much harder for them
to find help.
There is something you
can do, however: every
weekday next week the
King’s College NHS
Health Centre will be
hosting a swab test drop
-in, where people can test
to see whether they are a
match for Kaiya. They’re
asking anyone eligible
who is of South Asian
heritage to go along and
see whether they can help
Kaiya.
For those who are not
of South Asian heritage,
or are unable to go along
to the drop-in sessions,
it is still possible to join
the bone marrow donor
register: those between
the ages of 16-30, who are
in good health, can visit
Anthony Nolan to sign
up, while those over the
age of 30 can sign up to
alternative registers, such
as DKMS. After signing
up to the register, you will
get a cheek swab, which
you then send off – and
that’s it, you’re registered!
If you’re a match,
you’ll be asked to donate
stem cells. Two methods
are possible, with the
vast majority of people
undergoing peripheral
blood stem cell collection.
This involved receiving
medication to increase the
number of stem cells in
your blood, before blood
is taken through a needle
in one arm, similar to a
regular blood donation.
While Kaiya and
her family are trying to
maintain a normal life,
time is of the essence in
the race to find a donor.
“Kaiya is our world.” her
parents have said, “She is
the kindest, big-hearted
person you will ever
know. She is such a sweet,
fun-loving girl that makes
everyone laugh with her
infectious giggle. She is an
amazing big sister and we
are so proud to have her
as our daughter. We want
to celebrate her birthdays,
see her graduate and have
the happy and successful
life we’ve dreamt for her.
She is destined for big
things and only you can
help get her there. We are
forever indebted to the
kindness of our friends
and strangers.”

Kaiya needs to find a match soon // CureKaiya
While survival rates can
generally be rather good
for ALL, they are greatly
dependent on a wide
range of clinical and bio-
logical factors. They are
also dependent on having
the right kind of treatment
available – chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and stem
cell transplants.
Kaiya is one of the over
2,000 people in the UK
who need a bone marrow
or stem cell transplant
each and every year, and
– as someone of South
Asian background – she
is facing an extra hurdle.
There is currently a
mismatch between supply
and demand on the stem
cell donor register, with
black and minority ethnic
(BAME) individuals
making up only 15% of
those registered. While
last year the charity
Anthony Nolan recorded
the highest number of
BAME donors register-
ing, BAME patients still
only have a 20.5% chance
of dinging their best
possible donor match, in
comparison with a nearly
70% chance in northern

t is becoming
increasingly clear
that technology is
advancing at such
a rate that tasks that
once took conservation-
ists weeks or months
have been cut down
to a number of days.
This includes the use
of equipment such as
camera traps, drones, and
custom-built prototypes
that are project specific.
If, like me, you enjoy the
fun of developing your
own piece of kit in order
to help answer a burning
scientific question then
I have great news for
you! There is an exisiting
online community called
WILDLABS.NET (found
at the web address of
the same name). It is a
combined community of
conservationists, engi-
neers, data scientists, and
other stakeholders. The
platform is designed to
share information, ideas,
tools and resources from
the community to help
others discover and imple-
ment technology-enabled
solutions to conservation
challenges. It is now, more
than ever, that technology
is needed if we are going
to solve the most pressing
conservation challenges
of the modern age.
The community itself
is run in association with
United for Wildlife, a
charitable organisation
that is the collaborative
efforts of multiple
non-governmental organi-
sations such as WWF and
ZSL. The great thing is
that whether you are using
a new piece of kit that
has already been built, or
designing your own from
the ground up, you should
be able to find a member
of the online community
who is able to help! I have
first-hand experience of
this: I designed a passive
acoustic monitoring
system for amphibians
to use in Borneo. It had
a few teething issues,
and I was not sure if the
components I tested the
system with would stand
up to the elements in the
rainforest. Thankfully,
multiple members of the
community were able to
help and, if it were not for
them, the project would
probably not have gone
ahead.
It is not just advice and
guidance that the commu-
nity provides, but also an
opportunity to collaborate
and network. Every scien-
tist knows that the key to
success is a combination
of these two things, and
networking with people
from all over the world
with the same technolog-
ical problems or solutions
is a great solution!
Thus, WILDLABS.NET
provides the conserva-
tion community with
a much-needed tool to
facilitate future partner-
ships between individu-
als and groups.

Science at the gym: the molecular basis of metabolism
E
xercise is good
for you, we all
know that. You
don’t need to
read an article on it – or
do you?
I guess the main
question is, do you know
how to exercise effective-
ly?
The standard answer
about the effects of ex-
ercising is that it trains
heart muscles to become
stronger, enabling it to
pumpeffectively,resulting
in better blood pressure.
However, these effects
are on the macro-scale,
and scientists have yet
to identify the molecules
that bring about the health
benefits of exercising. In
particular, how exercise is
able to elevate metabolic
rate.
Since metabolism is
essentially the rate at
which our bodies process
chemicals, understanding
the molecular factors is
important for us to combat
metabolic diseases and
obesity.
A recent paper demon-
strated that a molecule
named 12,13-dihy-
droxy-9Z-octadecenoic
acid (12,13-diHOME)
can influence metabolism.
This lipid molecule is
released by the liver and
fat tissues, and it belongs
to a class of molecule
scalled lipokines– ‘lipo’
refers to fat, and ‘kine’
denotes kinesis or
movement, suggesting
the molecule assists in the
process of fat transport.
Previous studies have also
reported that the lipokine
can improve skeletal
muscle insulin sensitivity,
therefore lowering ones’
risk of diabetes.
In human studies,
researchers have found
that 12,13-diHOME
levels increased after
exercise, compared to
13 other lipid molecules
that were measured. This
confirmed the theory that
this lipokine is induced
by exercise, with levels
increasing regardless of
gender or age.
Not only that, but they
also showed that 12,13-
diHOME negatively
correlated to fat mass and
body mass index (BMI).
In other words, you are
likely to have a higher
12,13-diHOME level
if you have a lower fat
content, or a lower BMI.
To study the mecha-
nism of 12,13-diHOME,
scientists used mouse
models to mimic the
effect of chronic exercise.
They found that, indeed,
the lipid molecule in
question increased after

exercise, and those mice
that were working out had
a lower fat mass as 12,13-
diHOME can increase
skeletal muscle fatty acid
uptake.
To investigate the
source of 12,13-diHOME,
the scientists removed dif-
ferent types of fat tissue,
and measured the level
of 12,13-diHOME in the
blood thereafter.
The results indicated
that mice that had their
brown fat removed do
not have an increased
lipokine level, even after
exercising in the same
manner. This experiment
demonstrated that 12,13-
diHOME released from
brown fat is essential
for an exercise-induced
increase of the molecule
itself.
Interestingly, brown
fat tissue is the type of
fat that is responsible for
generating heat when you
are feeling cold. Funny
enough, in another paper
by the same research
group, mice had an
enhanced cold tolerance
when they were exposed
to a cold environment, or
when 12,13-diHOME was
injected.
In the future, with suffi-
cient understanding of the
entire process, a synthetic
form of 12,13-diHOME
could be developed as a
drug to treat metabolic
diseases and obesity.
At present, it is best to
stick with your exercise
routine and eat healthy.
Alternatively, perhaps,
you can be experimental
and expose yourself to the
cold and see if you lose
weight faster!
Be warned though,
clearly, a larger human
cohort is required to
confirm effects, and
further studies are essen-
tial to understand the role
of lipokines in metabo-
lism. Enjoy your food and
appreciate your body – as
beauty comes in all forms!
Trainers hate it! Scientists identify new molecule implicated in exercise and weight loss!
Mmmm, feel that 12,13-diHOME! // CC
