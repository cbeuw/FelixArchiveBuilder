P
aris holds a
special place in
my heart because
it was my first
travel destination since I
moved to London, and it
made me fall in love with
travelling. It was during
the revision period for
my January exams in 2nd
year, when I got the idea,
which seemed so crazy at
the time, to just pack my
bags and go to Paris after
exams. The last exam was
on aThursday, and the new
module was scheduled for
the following Monday,
which left us with only
three days to relax and re-
juvenate. But since Paris
is so close to London and
visiting it had been my
dream for a long time (and
also I was running out of
ways to procrastinate), I
quickly organised trans-
port and accommodation,
convinced a friend to
come with me, and finally
went on this spontaneous
three-day trip that ended
up being one of the most
amazing things I’ve
done during my time at
Imperial.
Day 1
Our trip started on
Thursday evening as we
took the overnight bus
from London Victoria.
The journey took around
eight hours and was
around £15 one way (ob-
viously, a train or plane
would have been quicker
and more comfortable
but also much more
expensive). We crossed
the English Channel from
Dover to Calais on a ferry,
where we had to get off
the coach and sleep on
one of the sofas inside.
Pro tip: you literally have
to run to get yourself a
sofa, else you might be
stuck sleeping on a chair.
Upon arrival to Calais,
everyone was thoroughly
checked at the customs,
especially people from
outside the EU. Needless
to say, we didn’t get much
sleep that night, but hey, it
made the travel experience
even more adventurous
and unforgettable.
We arrived Paris at
5am, way too early for
our Airbnb check-in.
Without any data on our
phones or a plan on how
to travel around the city,
we wandered around until
we found an underground
station. Luckily, they
have maps all across the
underground system that
clearly indicate where
each landmark is. So the
first thing we did at five
o’clock in the morning
was visiting the Eiffel
Tower. Since it only opens
at 9am, we first went for
breakfast at a cute French
café, where a lovely local
lady gave us some sight-
seeing tips.
We came to the tower
just in time for sunrise,
which looked absolutely
amazing! The tower has a
few floors, with different
ticket prices – the very
top floor was closed so
we could only get student
tickets for the middle
one. We spent some time
admiring the city from
above, did some souvenir
shopping inside, and
found an ice rink on one
of the floors. Never had I
ever thought I would ice-
skate above Paris!
We then continued our
journey along Avenue
des Champs-Élysées, a
large famous street full
of shops and restaurants.
We had to stop at one of
the clothes shops to get
some warm gloves and
socks since the Parisian
winter was much colder
than that in London. Then,
after a ‘lavish’ lunch at
McDonalds (I usually opt
for super cheap food and
accommodation whilst
travelling and spend more
money on sightseeing
instead), we reached
the Arc de Triomphe.
But since we were still
carrying our heavy bags
and tired after only four
hours of sleep on the bus,
we headed straight to our
Airbnb to drop off our
stuff and have a nap.
In the evening, we
visited the Musée du
Louvre (tickets are free
for people under 25) to
see the original Mona Lisa
and other famous works
of art. On our way home,
we caught a glimpse of
the beautifully lit up Eiffel
Tower in the distance.
Day 2
We dedicated this day
to Disneyland, located
outside of the main city
area but still accessible
by direct trains. We got a
one-day two-park ticket
for around £60 (mind you,
this was two years ago and
was also cheaper since
we went during off-peak
season), but only managed
tovisitoneparksincethere
are so many things to do.
We went to all of the kids’
rides and were the only
20 year-olds standing in
line (ain’t even ashamed,
I paid too much to skip
all that). Adult attractions
were a bit more daring,
like the House of Horrors
or high-speed roller
coasters, which altogether
added up to an amazing
experience. We concluded
the day by watching the
firework show above
the main Disney castle,
the last attraction of the
day. (Some advice here:
pack your own lunch for
famous amusement parks
since prices there are too

Day 3
Our last day was quite
chill. We climbed up the
Arc de Triomphe which
overlooks the city, with
twelve streets projecting
around the Arc in all
directions. We also visited
the Notre-Dame Cathe-
dral and Montmartre to
complete our Paris expe-
rience. The only thing we
didn’t have time for was
the Palace of Versailles,
containing a museum and
gardens, situated in the
suburbs of Paris.
Finally, we took our bus
journey back to London
– having just arrived at
8am, we were already
sitting in the lecture
theatre that afternoon.
However sleep-deprived
I was, my happiness with
this trip was over the top
– that’s when I realised
how awesome travelling
is, and it might be even
more fun when you get to
do that spontaneously.
