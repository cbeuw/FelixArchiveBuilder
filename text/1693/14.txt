Just one more turn: the arbitrary endpoint
GAMES

P
icture this. It’s
3am. The only
sound you can
hear is the rhap-
sodic music of your game.
Sleep is trying to lure you
into its pull. You try to
resist its charms. You have
lectures in the morning.
You know the smart thing
to do is to shut down the
game, and go to sleep. But
you can’t bring yourself to
do it. Just one more level
up, one more turn and it’ll
all be over.
This is a scenario a lot
of gamers are familiar
with. We all give our-
selves a limit, we all say
we’re not going to cross
it, but before we know it,
we’ve already gamed our
night away and are feeling
somewhat miserable, or
at the very least, utterly
exhausted when it’s over.
Unless of course, you’ve
been downing Mountain
Dew like a madman. I’ll
keep going until I hit the
next level, you think.
Why do we do that?
Do we really get any
advantage over doing
something there and then
as opposed to doing it
later, after we’ve done
more important things?
No we don’t; it’s the
game, or maybe yourself,
fooling you into thinking
you need to keep going,
for some kind of artificial
endpoint. You may feel
like you have something
to complete before you
can stop, but you really
don’t.
As an example of this,
imagine you’re reading
a book. You’re about to
close the book and go to
sleep only to realise you
have eight or so pages left.
You decide to forgo sleep
forthemomentandplough
on. It’s understandable
why someone would do
this; you’ve just invested
eleven or so hours into
reading the book, and you
think another half an hour
won’t make a difference.
But remember, at this
point, you’re already half
asleep, and the ending
won’t have the same
amount of impact on you
now as compared to when
you’re wide awake.
call it quits while you’re
still ahead. But then you
find out you’re only a
few more achievements
away from levelling up.
So you decide to slog
yourself through it and
get the achievement. But
once you do, you don’t
really feel any better for
it. In fact, you might look
at your current gaming
time a little less fondly
than before. Why is this?
Simply put, you stopped
playing for the fun of it.
You were now playing to
complete a task. Worst
still, it was a task with no
real benefit, at least not
in the real world at that
moment. It was a task you
decided to put on yourself.
People, in general, love
completing things: it’s
human nature. Whenever
you decide to finish
playing a game, you
do so out of your own
volition, after you’ve hit
some sort of goal. Game
designers make sure
to add in some kind of
markers or indicators that
make us feel some kind of
progress or completion.
These can take the form of
checkpoints, rewards after
completing challenges or
finishing a level.
For the most parts,
these types of endpoints
aren’t bad. They give a
sense of game advance-
ment, or, in the case of
certain achievements,
encourage you to play in
a different and interesting
way. The real issue is with
meaningless endpoints,
which players create for
themselves. Civilisation
is the biggest game where
players create hollow
endpoints for themselves.
‘Finishing’ a game of Civ,
involves several hours
at the fastest and several
weeks at the slowest. You
just cannot finish a game
of Civ in a short timespan,
so you settle for stopping
at the next turn, which
leads to the next turn and
so on. And thus, people
find themselves unable to
let go or stop a game.
Free-to-play games,
especially, mobile games
in particular, are usually
designed in a way to give
you some arbitrary end-
points. They usually have
several types of progres-
sion bars or achievements
list to show you how much
you’ve been playing and
how much you serve to
gain by playing further.
“Gain” is a bit of a loose
term, it’s really the game
confusing your brain into
thinking there are things
to be gained.
Hopefully, now that
I’ve spelt things out a
bit, it’ll be become easier
to drop games at the first
opportunity. Recognise
why you’ve been playing
up until a certain point
and whether you’re doing
it to meet some kind of
artificial endpoint. If you
can learn to let go at the
right time, you’ll be all
the better for it and enjoy
the game much more as a
whole.
More often than not, we keep on playing a game even though we know we should’ve stopped a while ago. What
exactly is the reason behind this?

In a more gaming
related example, imagine
you’ve been playing a few
games of Dota. You’ve
been doing really well
