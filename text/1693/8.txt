L
ater this month,
on May 25th
,
the Republic of
Ireland will hold
an historic vote: whether
or not to repeal the 8th
Amendment of the Irish
Constitution, which states:
“The State acknowl-
edges the right to life
of the unborn and, with
due regard to the equal
right to life of the mother,
guarantees in its laws
to respect, and, as far as
practicable, by its laws to
defend and vindicate that
right”
As such, television,
radio and, of course, social
media have been rife
with proponents of both
a ‘Yes’ vote – advocating
repealing the Amendment
and liberalising abortion
rights laws in the country
– and a ‘No’ vote. There
is one argument, amidst
the many banded about,
with which I take issue,
and that I wish to try
and address here. Whilst
the argument is one that
is used to advocate a
pro-abortion rights stance,
I want to be clear that I
am not arguing against
having the right to have
an abortion, but against
the logic, and claimed
importance, of a specific
argument used for it; each
side retains legitimate and
logical arguments, and I
am not coming down on
either side.
The argument in
question, used by
pro-abortion rights activ-
ists, is this: “I believe that
a woman has the right to
choose what to do with
her body”.
In my opinion, although
a woman’s choice certain-
ly comes into the issue to
some degree, it is not the
central point on which the
debate rests, and its con-
tinued inflammatory use
suggests you are either for
women having any right
to choose anything, and
so pro-abortion rights, or
against women having the
right to choose anything,
and so against, creating
an unnecessary stifling of
opinion and discussion.
The debate of abortion
ultimately rests on at
what stage one believes
an unborn foetus is alive,
such that its termination
is considered either an
innocuous action, like
removing a small growth
of cells, or such that its
termination is considered
equivalent to killing
another human being.
For instance – do we
propose that the child is
entirely not alive before
birth, even a few seconds
before delivery? I doubt
that most people would
agree with that. Similar-
ly, I doubt most people
would describe a day-old
zygote as being alive; so
the answer must lie in a
grey area somewhere in
between.
If you believe that the
unborn foetus is not alive,
then the expectant mother
can do what she likes
(subject to my second
point later on), much as
we wouldn’t care if she
elected to have plastic
surgery, or get a tattoo. If
you believe that an unborn
foetus is alive, then it isn’t
simply another part of
the woman’s body, and a
more nuanced approach
must be taken. Is the
foetus fully alive, such
that no one has a right to
terminate it, in the same
around whether or not a
foetus is alive. Current
rhetoric, however, seems
to place the burden of the
argument solely around
the issue of women’s
choice, conflating the
issues and fuelling pithy,
virtue-signalling argu-
ments that don’t really
deal with the complexity
at stake.

way you can’t murder
someone? Or is the foetus
alive in some diminished
capacity? If so, what are
the ramifications of this?
Can we terminate the
foetus if there are medical
complications with the
mother? What about when
there aren’t any, but she
simply doesn’t want to
have the baby? It is only
at this late stage that we
can begin to discuss a
woman’s right to choose,
and thus a woman’s right
to choose is very much a
secondary consideration,
placed firmly in the
shadow of the debate
Now, I hear you say,
surely a woman has a
right to choose for herself
whether she thinks the
foetus is alive or not,
and act accordingly? I
would counter with this:
Moral relativism, rightly
or wrongly (a little joke
there), is practised in most
secular countries by way
of democratic consensus:
we all largely agree that
it’s wrong to murder
people, so it’s against the
law. In this framework,
I as an individual don’t
have the right to decide
for myself whether killing
is wrong, and I can’t
take action – such as
killing them – based on
my personal assessment.
Abortion shouldn’t be any
different. With abortion, a
country makes a decision
as to how it views the life
of a foetus, and at what
stage, and what the laws
should be in line with that
view; they thus vote on
their view of morality, and
its place in the law, in the
same democratic process
through which all our
legislation is enshrined.
Individuals don’t have the
right to choose their own
morals and apply them
in contravention to law,
law that has canonised
the moral consensus of
the people. Abortion is no
exception.
Furthermore, the
implication of the binary
nature of this argument –
you’re either pro women’s
choice, or against it – and
the proxy this seems to
play for your stance on
abortion also seems to
cruelly ignore any rights
ofthefather.Afoetusisnot
the exclusive property of
a mother simply because
it resides in her womb.
Babies have fathers too.
Just because the DNA
of the father resides in
the body of the mother,
doesn’t remove the fact
that it exists, and, by right
of paternity, belongs (in
the way that any child
belongs to a parent) to
him. Where is his say?
That is not to demand that
the male voice overpow-
ers or vetoes that of the
female – but, as parents
of a child, together, they
should be respected and
consulted. What does
women’s choice have to
do with the decision of two
parents, made together?
Again, there is plenty of
scope for debate around
ownership, and at what
point a bundle of cells
becomes a child, that has
parents, who have rights;
my point is that, even as
a secondary argument in
the issue, women’s rights
do not stand alone as a
deciding factor.
To be unequivocally
clear: my argument is not
for or against actually
“This is a
dangerous
game of proxy,

issues”
having the right to have an
abortion. What I’m trying
to demonstrate is that
one particular argument,
the right of a woman to
choose what to do with her
body, is far less relevant
to the actual issue at hand
than activists are making
it. In my opinion, this is a
dangerous game of proxy,
that blurs lines and plays
politics with serious and
socially significant issues.
It’s time to repeal the 8th
once and for all
Ireland’s abortion laws are regressive, cruel, and out of place in the modern world. It’s time
they finally go.
O
n May 25th
,
Ireland will
be holding a
r e f e r e n d u m
on abortion laws, more
specifically on whether
to repeal Article 40.3.3
of its constitution (also
known as the 8th amend-
ment). The amendment
states that foetuses and
women are to be given
the same right to life, and
hence renders abortions
illegal – except in cases
where women’s lives
are at risk. This makes
Ireland the only country
in Europe with such tight
laws on abortion, with the
exception of Malta, where
abortion is illegal in all
cases.
The referendum mainly
stems from the death in
2012 of Savita Halap-
panavar, and the following
protests and mobilisation
to repeal the amendment.
Ms Halappanavar, a
31-year old dentist, died
from septic shock and
multi-organ failure as a
result from complications
from a miscarriage, as she
was repeatedly refused
an abortion. Her case

highlighted the thin line
between defining risk to
a pregnant woman’s life
and risk to a pregnant
woman’s health, which
is one of the many
controversial aspects of
Ireland’s current law. At
present, any pregnant
female in Ireland apart
from the circumstances
mentioned previously –
let her be victim of rape,
of those terminations:
Irish women in particular
resort to ordering abortion
pills online, and unsafely,
shamefully, taking them
at home, or travelling to
Britain where abortion
is free under the NHS.
Around 5,000 women a
year travel out of Ireland
to abort, but it comes at
a cost that not all women
can afford, including of
course a heavy physical
and mental toll.
In some cases, women
are forced to carry a
dead embryo to full term
and deliver a stillborn,
as would have been the
case for Lupe, originally
from Spain, who had been
carrying a dead embryo
for two months and flew
back to her home country
to get an abortion. In other
cases, they are forced to
carry out pregnancies that
result from rape or incest.
In 2014, an asylum seeker
who was kidnapped,
beaten, and raped in her
home country was forced
to keep, then prematurely
deliver, a baby by cae-
sarean at 25 weeks, after
she threatened to go on a
hunger strike in response
to being repeatedly denied
an abortion. The United
Nations and UN Commit-
tee Against Torture have
stated in the last decade
that denying abortion for
a pregnancy due to rape
can be recognised as a
form of torture. Similarly,
denying abortion in cases
of severe and fatal foetal
impairment is considered
a violation of human
rights.
Abortion is undenia-
bly an on-going debate
and sensitive topic, but
this referendum is a
much-needed step for
Ireland to bring its leg-
islation up to a modern,
and humane standard. The
strong rallying of citizens
for the ‘Repeal’ campaign
shows the importance and
relevance of this vote.
While polls were giving
a clear ‘Yes’ vote for the
past few months, they are
now narrowing and giving
a less defined outcome.
While every person
is entitled to their own
beliefs and opinion, it
does not seem empathetic
to deny – and punish –
abortion in all but one
unclear case, on the
basis of one’s individual
opinion. Repeal the 8th
is merely about moving
on from forcing decisions
and punishments upon
women, to giving them
access to a possibility and
choice they have been so
far denied, that results
from deeply engrained
mentalities and religious
values.

incest, undergoing a
complicated or unwanted
pregnancy – incurs up
to 14 years in prison for
terminating a pregnancy.
However, as statistics
have shown in various
countries, the number
of abortions does not
decrease where abortion
is illegal, instead having
an impact on the safety
