Take your protein pills and put your hair gel on
Arctic Monkeys return with their follow up to AM: A full-blown concept album that takes in modern politics and
social commentary, while moving towards a new sound.
F
rom the record’s
title alone, it
is immediately
apparent that this
LP is going to be unlike
anything we have heard
from the Arctic Monkeys
so far.
They have a huge
legacy, with a sound
released before. The most
prevalent instrument is
the keyboard, contrasting
the guitar-laden approach
they had taken thus far.
It’s stripped back; across
most tracks only simple
melodies accompany
Turners vocals, which
have also undergone
an upheaval, almost
sounding like spoken
word. Largely discarded
also are single-ready
crowd pleasers with mem-
orable chorus’ and riffs;
instead they have made a
concept album.
“Houston, Tranquillity
Base here. The Eagle
has landed.” Neil Arm-
strong declared during
the 1969 moon landing,
which would be the site
where humans walked
on a different celestial
body for the first time.
The album’s concept is a
very literal translation of
this, setting up a resort
upon the moon with
Turner playing a character
looking introspectively
at humanity and himself.
Indeed, the opening lyric,
“I just wanted to be one
of The Strokes / now look
at the mess you’ve made
me make”, shows how far
from their roots they have
travelled, a world away
from playing to small
crowds in Sheffield bars.
And this is one of the
issues that many fans are
divided over. These cocky,
funny, and unabashedly
arrogant young men
started out uncaring of
success, shunning awards
shows, and looking down
upon crowd-pleasing
artists. Eight years on
from their debut, the
release of AM showed
grown rock stars, a com-
pletely different front to
the one they portrayed in
their earliest days, leading
to shouts from some fans
that they had sold-out.
And now with the new
record, we have a new
face again; relatable in its
loneliness and vulnerabil-
ity, but more remote than
ever.
It would be naïve to
them to still be singing
about slipping past the
bouncer into a club.
Listening to their debut
though, it is hard to
believe that they would
have turned to social com-
mentary and politics for
new musical inspiration.
But here we are. In nearly
every song, Turner sings
about his mistrust of the
rapid usurpation of tech-
nology and social media.
His character sits in
their lunar hotel, looking
at humanity viewing
each other through their
screens, as it changes how
we interact and emote,
before ironically turning
to the internet himself to
help answer his questions:
“I want an interesting
synonym to describe this
thing / that you say we are
all grandfathered in / I’ll
use the search engine”.
In 2005, Alex Turner
was taking a “Topshop
princess” home, now he is
staring at his ‘Batphone’,
waiting for it to light up
with a message from the
one he is falling for.
‘Golden Trunks’ delves
into the political world;
it includes the quite fan-
tastic lyric “the leader of
the free world / reminds
you of a wrestler wearing
tight golden trunks / He’s
got himself a theme tune
/ they play it for him
as he makes his way to
the ring”. In a sense this
echoes their previous
style, comedic and witty,
but more poncey - this
new flowery cynicism is
shown again in ‘American
Sports’. Turner bemoans
politicians “taking the
truth and making it fluid”-
a round-about way of
saying ‘fake news’.
does it become too much?
This new prose-like
style contains so many
references to famous
works and some lines
are so pompous it makes
you wonder if he had a
thesaurus beside him as
he wrote. It is an issue he
addresses throughout the
album, that it may “end
up too clever for its own
good”. And despite the
flooring arrogance, it’s
difficult to disagree.
Undoubtedly, the
hardest thing to swallow
about the album is its lack
of instrumental prowess.
This bare sound is not
what they are known for,
and this latest venture
feels as though the rest of
the band have been sorely
underutilised. When im-
agining it live, I struggle
to see anything other
than Turner taking centre
stage, with Nicholas
O’Malley, Jamie Cook,
and Matt Helders lurking
tentatively behind him,
contributing infrequent
chords or the occasional,
lonely drum.
But on reflection, I
really do enjoy the album.
I didn’t expect them to
recreate an old sound, but
on first listening I did ex-
perience the shock felt by
so many. It is incredibly
different; and although
it was a pleasant expe-
rience, I did not feel any
of the emotional response
that their music usually
induces. However, on
every subsequent relisten,
I have taken away some-
thing new from it. It’s
subtle, complicated, and,
while a bit pretentious,
oddly endearing. But
then, what else would you
expect from someone at
Tranquillity Base Hotel
and Casino, observing
us from their detached
existence?

that shifts from album
to album. Their debut,
Whatever People Say I
Am That’s What I’m Not,
which became the fastest
selling debut in British
music history, is a fast
paced, highly charged
record. Moving away
from this style, they
explored more melodic
descriptions of love and
heartbreak before arriving
at AM in 2013, which
enjoyed a huge commer-
cial success with its dark
and lustful tones. Five
years on, they have finally
released something new
and the main questions
that preceded it were how
they would sound now?
Would they rehash AM’s
winning formula? No, of
course not.
This album is a far
cry from any that the
Arctic Monkeys have

commentary

Alex Turner is a clever
man, some of his lyrics
are truly beautiful and
resonate with the listener.
