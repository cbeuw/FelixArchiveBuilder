“always there as a welfare
provision”, he now sees
students presenting in
need of serious extra
support. “What it unclear
is whether those students
existed in that form before
and suffered in silence,
or whether there is some
change that is having an
impact on them.”
Anecdotally, he has
seen more students ap-
plying for space in halls
on account of a disability,
including mental health
problems. The increased
awareness of mental
health has been reflected
in his training, but he
reports reductions in
overall support for war-
dening teams: “There may
have been more resources
put into the whole support
network across College,
[but] wardening is possi-
bly the exception, where
we’ve seen a reduction in
numbers.”
§
It is important to high-
light these problems with
mental health are by no
means unique to Imperial.
Rather, it is a problem pre-
senting across the board
at universities and within
this age group. Professor
Buitendijk told Felix the
“concerns about waiting
times for the student
counselling service,
which have increased due
to rising demand…are a
challenge faced by all UK
universities.”
In the past five years,
the vast majority of
universities have experi-
enced a sharp increase in
students seeking support,
with nearly 90,000 stu-
dents requesting counsel-
ling services in the UK in
2015/16. The number of
students dropping out of
university due to mental
health problems has also
trebled in recent years,
with Norman Lamb,
former Health Minister,
describing the situation as
a “crisis on campus.”
It is a problem noted at
a national level: Universi-
ties UK last week released
a report on mental health
in higher education,
which revealed nearly
60,000 students disclosed
a mental health condition
to their university this
year, compared with under
10,000 ten years ago.
problems in the last five
to ten years, the academic
environment at Imperial
was a contributing factor.
“I think the academic
environment is a strong
part of perpetuating
issues people had before,”
Martyn tells me, “because
of this environment stu-
dents perceive we have –
and I don’t think it’s true,
I think students conform
to it – they put silly
pressure on themselves.
If you have mental health
issues, or a predisposition
to them, the chances are
you’re going to accelerate
that process by putting
all this extra pressure on
yourself.”
He tells me a story
about changes made to the
first year labs within the
Department of Materials:
a few years ago, students
would have around a week
to complete a comprehen-
sive lab report, whereas
now they submit a much
shorter piece of work the
next day. The submission
is electronic, so tutors can
monitor how many people
are turning it in at what
times: the results showed
people handing in work
throughout the night, up
until 7am. He asked his
students to raise their hand
if they’d spent more than
an hour on it, two hours,
three hours… by the time
he reached the eight hour
mark most of the class still
had their hands up. The
individual reports con-
tributed around 0.01% to
their degree, but “because
there are marks associated
with it, they put so much
time and effort into it,
disproportionate to the
magnitude of the task”.
It’s a story that calls
to mind the institutional
culture review carried
out at Imperial, in which
the words ‘competitive’,
‘ambitious’, and ‘driven’
were among the most fre-
quently-cited descriptors
of the College. The report
suggested there was a
lack of community spirit
within the university,
partly due to a lack of
communal space, and that
the “competitive, individ-
ualistic pursuit of research
excellence often comes
at the expense of other
values.” Students and
staff, the report argues,
“felt that there was an
all-consuming focus on
academic performance,
and negative attitudes
towards those who did not
do well or who were not
as driven as others.”
from speaking to friends
that so many people are
really struggling…unless
you tackle this culture,
almost independent of
how good the services are,
nobody is going to seek
them out.”
“If I wanted to send
out one message, it
would be that asking for
help is not weak.” Helen
Money-Kyrle, the Royal
School of Mines Union’s
(RSMU) Welfare Officer
tells me, “it shows that we
can be open to change, and
it allows us to improve.”
This inability to seek out
help has been identified
by many at Imperial as a
major stumbling block for
student support.
At the end of my con-
versation with Martyn,
he takes me down the
corridor from his office
to show me the Materials
Common Room – a lecture
theatre the department
converted into a shared
space, and given back to
students. The handful of
students present – sitting
at sofas, gathered around
tables looking at laptops
– sit up to attention when
Martyn enters, but quickly
relax back into their usual
routine. “It has caused us
issues with timetabling
and with management,”
Martyn says, “but I think
the benefits are good.”
The space, which en-
courages students from
different years to spend
time together, forming
inter-year groups, is
something of which he is
clearly very proud. “To
say ‘I found that difficult’
or ‘I wasn’t prepared for
that’ is seen as a sign of
weakness…having other
people say they went
through the same thing [at
that stage of their degree]
makes you think you’re
not alone, which I think is
hugely beneficial.”
§
At the end of my
conversation with Rosie,
after we have discussed
the need the Counselling
Service has for more re-
sources, I ask her one last
question: how does she
feel about the future?
“I will be a lot more
positive if I hear we’ve
got the additional resourc-
es, and space to put that
additional resource in.
That we’ve got a waiting
room, and there are plans
to look at mental health
across Imperial in a joined
up, integrated way. Then I
will be very positive.”
Names have been
changed.
“Students
said an echo-
chamber of
myths drove
competition”
The UUK report also
highlighted the number of
suicides among students,
which they say have been
increasing steadily since
2013. In the run-up to this
article I received emails
from a number of staff
who have been informed
that three Imperial under-
graduates have taken their
own lives this academic
year – significantly higher
than would be expected
for the age group or
geographical area. The
College told Felix their
records showed only one
student who had taken
their own life since 2016,
as judged by a coroner as
part of an official inquiry.
They are not able to
speculate on past student
deaths, or ongoing inquir-
ies.
Why has there been
this increase in mental
health problems? Martyn
believes there has been a
change in what it is like to
be a young person, and “at
the point of entry students
seemtocomeinwithmuch
more baggage than they
did historically”, while
others identify increased
academic, financial, and
social pressures.
While most people
I spoke to felt Imperial
had become a lot better at
recognising mental health

Mitigating Circumstances
If you encounter anything that affects your
academic life at Imperial – examinations,
coursework, projects, or general study – you
should inform your Personal Tutor and your
department’s Senior Tutor as soon as possible.
Mitigating circumstances can cover a wide
range of issues, including physical or mental
health issues, personal problems, bereavement,
and financial troubles. Anything out of your
control that affects your ability to study could be
considered a mitigating circumstance.
It is important to raise concerns as soon as
they may arise, rather than waiting until later. If
your circumstances affect an assessment, you
should submit your mitigating circumstances
form within five working days of the examination
or assessment deadline. Submitting after the
deadline may mean that the claim will not be
accepted,regardlessofthereasonfortheclaim.
If you need more advice or information on
mitigating circumstances, please examine the
policy online, contact your personal tutor or
academic support, or speak to the Imperial
College Union Advice Centre for independent
support.

Representatives are selected from among the

“Unless you

Students we spoke to
cited an echo-chamber of
myths that drove compe-
tition within the College,
and led to people becom-
ing reticent to seek help.
“We hand out leaflets, we

as we can, we do surveys,
and we get such a low re-

of the WBRN tells me,
