teams, students play an
important role in keeping
halls safe and secure.
Students are asked not to
let people tailgate when
entering halls, and are
advised to keep their room
doors locked even when
only away from their
room for a short time.”
Nigel Ward, Imperial
College Crime and Inves-
tigations Manager, also
advised staff and students
to keep valuables out of
sight and locked away.
“Report anyone you feel
looks suspicious to secu-
rity.” he told Felix, “We
would rather get 100 false
calls than miss the one
about someone who is up
to no good.”
If students have any
security concerns, they
are encouraged to call
the security team on

Teaching Assistant and
Best Tutoring.
Nick Burstow, Deputy
President (Education),
who headed the SACAs
this year, said the evening
was “incredible”, and it
was “a pleasure to see just
how much the SACAs
mean to the staff at Impe-
rial”
It was a good night
for the Department of
Materials and the Imperial
College Business School,
who took home two
awards each. Professor
Marisa Miraldo, an asso-
ciate professor in health
economics, kicked off the
evening with her award
for Best Supervision.
The panel said she was
described as “outstanding
and inspiring” in her
nominations. PhD student
Hormoz Ramian, also
from the Business School,
took home the award for
Best Graduate Teaching
Assistant.
From the Department
of Materials, Dr Anna
Regoutz was awarded
Best Teaching for Un-
dergraduates; she was
described as “a shining
pearl in a murky sea of
confusing lectures” in one
of her nominations. Dr
Luc Vandeperre, a Reader
in Structural Ceramics
from the Department of
Materials, was awarded
Best Feedback.
Best Innovation was
awarded to Giskin Day,
course lead for the new in-
tercalated BSc in Medical
Humanities, Philosophy,
and Law, for her “out of
the box thinking, imagi-
native use of gamification
in teaching content, and
expanding the horizons of
her students”
Speaking to Felix, Day
said she felt “honoured”
to receive the award:
“The students inspire me,
because I always learn
so much from them, but
there is also a team of
innovative teachers – I’m
inspired by a lot of people.
Just being given the per-
mission to be innovative
at a big university like this
is really nice. There’s a
great future ahead for in-
novative, interdisciplinary
teaching.”
Burstow told Felix:
“The SACAs are a truly
wonderful initiative, and
a reminder of what we
should all be making more
time to do: to celebrate ex-
cellence, to share positivi-
ty, and most importantly,
to say ‘thank you’ to those
who have made a differ-
ence to us. Despite the
pressures students face,
this year saw our students
saying ‘thank you’ more
than ever before, with
nearly 2000 nominations
submitted."

Changes to appeals and

I
mperial College
London has put in
place changes to
their policies on
academic appeals and
student complaints,
aimed to make the pro-
cess clearer and easier.
The changes, which
came into effect earlier
this week, included sep-
arating out arithmetical
mark checks from the
usual appeals process,
providing more infor-
mation to students about
how and when to escalate
complaints, and providing
clear timelines for those
on both sides.
Registry, who deal with
complaints and appeals,
say the changes were
made to make the process
easier for students to un-
derstand, providing clear
timelines and stages to
the complaints or appeal
process.
The changes came
into effect from the 14th
May, following approval
from Imperial College’s
Senate. All appeals and
complaints raised from
the 14th onwards will fall
under the new procedures.
No student will be disad-
vantaged by the changes
that have been made.
A working party from
across the College, and
including consultation
with the Imperial College
Union sabbatical officers
and the advice centre
made the changes based
on recommendations that
arose from existing sector
guidance, such as the
Office of the Independent
Adjudicator’s ‘Good
Practice Framework’,
as well as reviewing the
cases they have handled.
Students who would
like advice or guidance
on complaints or appeals
can get in touch with
their programme team in
the first instance or visit
Imperial College Union’s
Advice Centre.

I
mperial College
Union earlier this
week opened its
doors to nomina-
tions for its third set of
elections this academic
year. The elections are
running to fill the many
remaining positions
across four categories:
Liberation & Commu-
nity Officers; Constit-
uent Union Leaders;
Academic & Wellbeing
Representatives; and
Clubs, Societies & Pro-
ject committee roles.
Nominations opened
on the 16th
May, and will
be closing on the 23rd
. The
timing of the elections
has changed compared to
the Leadership Election
last term: candidates
will be able to campaign
M

Coors – the
c u r r e n t
n o n - d r a f t
beer provider – has been
chosen as the new draft
beer supplier for the
Imperial College Union
bars, replacing Greene
New Union bar supplier named
King
The change of supplier
will take effect on the 1st
of August, after a five
months' tender process
for the position. Staropra-
men, Pravha, Carling, and
Aspalls among others will
be available from the keg.
While the Union is still to
make a decision on prices,
following a separate
budgeting process, previ-
ous surveys released by
the Union suggest a pint
of Staropramen could cost
up to £4.50 against £2.80
for current house lager
Stella 4.
Matt Blackett told
Felix: "‘I am delighted
to announce the new bar
supplier for the Union
will be Molson Coors. It
was fantastic to be part of
the tender process along
with the other student
representatives on the
Panel. The hard work put
in by the Union’s Com-
mercial Services team has
resulted in a great deal for
our members for the next
three years.”
“This represents a new
chapter for our venues,
with an increased product
range, greater event
support and many more
benefits for our student
staff and all our custom-
ers.’"
The Union stated
that choice will lead to
better value for money
while also allowing for
increased training for the
bar staff
With the arrival of
Molson Coors, students
will be able to name and
brand the company’s
house cider. A call for
suggestions will be held
with students giving their
suggestions, along with
the reason for the choices.
The vote will be closed-
box to avoid inappropriate
entries.
The decision was
guided by feedback
from a survey conducted
earlier this year asking
students for their opinion
on the choice of house
lagers. The Union stated
at the time: ”The Union
is always looking to
improve services for
students and listening to
students’ views is critical
to this”.
The survey came after
a wave of criticism direct-
ed towards the Union for
changing the house lager
of four years, Stella 4, to
Bud-Light – described
by one student as “literal
piss” – without consulting
the student body. The
Union claimed that the
move was saving stu-
dents £10,000 during the
academic year. Stella 4
was subsequently brought
back after a three month
absence.
from Friday 25th
May,
with voting opening on
Tuesday 29th
. The voting
will stay open until Friday
1st
June.
Any student who will
be continuing their studies
at Imperial College for the
next year is able to run for
a position provided they
meet any prerequisites
for the role. There are
high hopes the remaining
positions will be filled,
to allow committees and
teams to begin work and
planning for the upcom-
ing year.
This is the third set of
elections this academic
year. The previous elec-
tions, which ended on 9th
March, saw the election
of Robert Tomkies as
Union president. All key
central Union roles were
filled bar the LGBT+
Officer. A number of Con-
stituent Union roles went
unclaimed, particularly
within the Royal College
of Science Union and the
City and Guilds College
Union.
There was a widespread
lack of competition for
many of the roles, with a
number of roles having
no candidates standing.
The election also saw
some students run for
multiple roles, perhaps in
apprehension of a wave
of stiff competition. In
some cases this backfired,
leading to students having
to drop out of some roles
after being elected. Many
of these roles are now
aimed to be filled by these
upcoming elections.
Nominations are open
until Wednesday 23rd
May.
You can nominate yourself
on the Union website.

This election is essential to the functioning
and productivity of many groups on campus.
With committees lacking team members
work may prove to be stagnant, and any
progression students have been asking for
hindered. The‘excitement’of these secondary
or tertiary elections can seem to pale in
comparison to the larger leadership elections.
However, it is important to note that many of
these unclaimed roles are pivotal.
Perhaps we ought to take a more front
seat approach to these elections, to allow
for some healthy rivalry and see the election
of inspired and committed members of our
Union. Taking on a committee position may
feel daunting at first but whilst taking on a
role of responsibility can add to a task list it
doesn’t necessarily have to reduce the quality
of each completed task. We must strive for
excellence both within and outside of our
academic lives.
