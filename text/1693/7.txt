T
he olden days
of warfare, of
shrewd generals
c o m m a n d i n g
their gallant troops into
majestic battles, are long
gone. The guerres du
jour are served as drawn
out, low-intensity meat
grinders across land, sea,
and air, augmented by
a generous portion of
ideological – and perhaps,
one could say, memetic
– disinformation warfare
waged both convention-
ally across mainstream
media and asymmetri-
cally on one of the most
sophisticated pieces of
technology devised by
humankind: the Internet.
In the information age,
the collective power and
influence wielded by the
Western establishment
in the government,
media, intelligence, and
military spheres form the
most powerful arsenal
in the battle for public
opinion. The lionization
of the YPG, the Kurdish
guerrilla which form the
backbone of the US-sup-
ported Syrian Democratic
Forces (SDF), in the
Western psyche as “an
organization which has
an ideology that combines
libertarian socialism,
gender equality, respect
for ethnic minorities,
secularism and green
politics”– as described in
a recent Felix comment
piece – is one of the most
recent showcases for the
power of this propaganda
machine. The narrative
from the Western main-
stream media about this
group is structurally
sound only when sup-
ported by cherry-picked
examples which distort
the facts on the ground
by presenting half-truths,
or, in some cases, outright
falsehoods. The YPG
commit acts which are as
reprehensible and against
the ideas of the “Western
liberal consensus” as
any other group in this
conflict, examples of
which include:
• The use of female
child soldiers under the
influence of drugs
• Admitting to use
of civilian clothing by its
militants which is a war
crime per Article 48 of the
Additional Protocol I to
the Geneva Conventions,
blurring the lines between
combatants and civilians
• According to the
UN, preventing civilians
from leaving Afrin and
hence utilising them as
human shields (a tactic
also used by ISIS)
• Inciting and
supporting attacks on
civilians in Europe – think
about what the headlines
would have been in the
case of similar Molotov
attacks backed by ISIS
Sifting through popular
media outlets such as
CNN or The Guardian, it
is nigh impossible to find
any reporting on these
deeds which would tarnish
the YPG’s credentials.
Such selective report-
ing is, of course, not
unique to the internet
age. The most harrowing
example of this behaviour
is The Independent’s
heroic portrayal of Osama
bin Laden soon after the
end of the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan, when his
fighters were still useful
CIA assets. However,
whether delivered by
the far more pervasive
platform of the Internet or
via the ancient-yet-proven
medium of newspapers,
the main objective behind
such pieces is often
drumming up support for
interventionist foreign
policy objectives. These
policies have already
led to disastrous conse-
quences not only in the
warzones themselves
(attacking Afghanistan
to destroy a regime led
by militias who staged
9/11 but were previously
supported by the CIA;
outright lying about Iraqi
chemical weapons as a
pretext for invasion; “hu-
manitarian interventions”

in Syria and Libya) but
also in Western countries
as evidenced by the recent
string of Islamist terrorist
attacks across Europe and
as in Libya and Syria
which accelerated rad-
icalization of Muslims
living in the West and
worsened the refugee
waves. The second step
is the radicalization of
the Euro-American right
which leads to further
foreign interventions.
The most tragic manifes-
tation of this causation
loop in the UK was the
Manchester bombing in
2017, where the attacker
was trained by the Libyan
Islamic Fighting Group –
an organization funded by
the MI:6 in the 1990s to
assassinate Gaddafi.
In response to the Man-
chester bombing, Jeremy
Corbyn faced excoriating
responses for suggesting
that failure in foreign
policy played a central
role in the propagation
of extremist ideologies,
and that the war on terror
was a failure. Upon closer
inspection, it is painfully
obvious that whenever
Western groups support
foreign armed groups, it
inevitably amplifies suf-
fering for both the people
in those countries and the
West itself. The world is
now teetering on the edge
of a war in Iran following
US President Trump’s
decision to withdraw from
the nuclear deal. To break
this cycle of madness, it
is increasingly important
to write to your MP, vote
for non-interventionist
candidates, and oppose
all foreign intervention –
whether that intervention
takes the form of a sup-
posedly Icelandic Pirate
Party-esque militia or of
a conventional invasion.
Otherwise, the tragedies
of Iraq, Libya and Syria
could repeat in Iran in
2019.

In fact, a feedback
loop created in the wars’
effects in Europe is the
most peculiar – it is a
two-step process initiated,
ironically, by Western
interventions, such those
