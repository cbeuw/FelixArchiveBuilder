"The reality is we don't have enough counselling staff to see the number of students who are approaching us"
account, to prevent those
with lower-level problems
being left indefinitely.
Students will then have
access to seven counsel-
ling sessions across the
year – the majority will
have under four sessions,
and can hold the remain-
ing sessions in reserve for
check-ins later on in the
year.Intheirannualreport,
the service states: “whilst
this model enables a faster
turnover, we are mindful
this may also impact on
student satisfaction and
therapeutic improvement
for some students.”
Alongside this, the
Student Mental Health
Advice Service provides
support to students with
chronic conditions, who
need help throughout their
academic career. This
service can link into other
support networks, such as
the Disability Advisory
Service or the personal
tutor system, should the
student desire.
At its most basic level,
the current problems with
the Counselling Service
can be reduced to simple
economics: the supply
has not increased in line
with demand. While the
number of students reg-
istered has increased by
over 80% since 2012/13,
the number of sessions on
offer have only increased
by 60%. The results are
waiting times that have
slowly been creeping up
every year, and which now
stand at over seven weeks
between first contact and
regular counselling.
These are just average
times: students have an-
ecdotally reported waiting
times of up to 15 weeks,
while the longest anyone
waited from assessment to
counselling last year was
over nine months. These
figures can represent the
extremes – students who
request specific counsel-
lors or can only attend at
certain times will need
to wait longer – but the
waiting time is far above
the average 15 working
days most universities
report.
increased financial pres-
sures associated with
living in London; the rise
of social media; greater
demands on students to
perform academically.
The list goes on. In reality
it is a combination of all
the above driving the
increase in demand.
Nevertheless, for the
time being the Counsel-
ling Service is stuck in
limbo. The College, which
last year made nearly
£120 million in surplus,
are currently undertaking
rounds of financial plan-
ning, after which Rosie
will know how much, or
how little, she will have to
work with.
Professor Simone
Buitendijk, Vice-Provost
(Education), who is
responsible for a number
of aspects of the student
experience, including
welfare, told Felix the
College were planning on
increasing the support to
the Counselling Service:
“In the short term we are
planning to increase the
number of contact hours
we can offer each week.
In order to provide the
best service we can, we
will continue to prioritise
those in urgent need.”
“Our investment in
student counselling will
be increased significantly
in the next financial year.
In parallel the College is
working to put in place
a new student support
strategy which will pro-
actively help to reduce
stress. This includes
tackling issues related to
the academic experience
which we know can
exacerbate pre-existing
mental health problems.
It also includes initiatives
to help students maintain
a healthy lifestyle – both
personally and academi-
cally – with the aim that
we will reduce the need
for counselling as a con-
sequence.”
There is frustration
among students, however,
that any increases in
funding are coming too
late. Imperial advertises
the Counselling Service
within its prospectus, and,
in the words of one student
who has done work with
recruitment, “it’s sold
as part of the package
of being an Imperial
student.” For Claire, this
lack of comprehensive
support was one of the
most frustrating aspects
of her experience: “We
pay so much, but then we
don’t get anything for our
fees – I’m paying around
£10,000, but others can be
paying £30,000. Students
bring in money and a
good reputation for Impe-
rial, and then we don’t get
basic things like proper
mental health support.”
Shervin Sabeghi,
Welfare Officer of the
Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) says he
has experienced more
students speaking to him
about external private
services, as “they have no
confidence that they’ll be
seen quickly enough by
the Counselling Service…
in the very short term
College should be ensur-
ing all students who need
it can access counselling
in a reasonable time.”
unacceptable. The Union
is firm in the conviction
that student wellbeing,
in particular counsel-
ling and mental health
support services, are not
an optional extra, but a
core requirement of any
university. The Union
is pleased to see that in
many meetings, staff are
openly making the same
challenges, however we
are aware we cannot
become complacent.”
“The Union’s role
in supporting students’
welfare is one of passion-
ate advocacy. In line with
Our Strategy 2017-20,
we have been lobbying
the College to review the
way it approaches student
support, and provide a
more comprehensive of-
fering. Our objective is to
work in partnership with
the College to improve
students’ wellbeing and
amplify the student voice,
and that’s exactly what
we’ve been doing. The

Engineering, tell me they
are spending more time
speaking with students
facing difficulties than
they usually would; “we
can’t emphasise enough
how we don’t mind this
as far as our own time
is concerned, but we’re
not mental health profes-
sionals” – they only have
training in Mental Health
FirstAid – “and inevitably
can’t even pretend to give
some students the support
they need.”
the Union’s Wellbeing
Representation Network
(WBRN), a new body
of student volunteers re-
sponsible for signposting
students to appropriate
resources and feeding
back wellbeing-related
concerns to staff, said the
current situation made her
feel helpless: “Where do
you send them? You get
these situations where
there’s nothing you can
say, there’s no service
we can send them to. In
an ideal world the NHS
would pick up the slack,
but I do think the Coun-
selling Service provisions
need to be better.”
She recognises a similar
effect on staff: “It’s not
great [for them]…to feel
they’re not doing their
job”. It’s a sentiment
echoed by Rosie: “When
you feel like you’re not
meeting the needs of
people who are looking
to you, that’s stressful, no
matter what role you’re
in.”
Dr Fred Marquis,
Senior Tutor of the De-
partment of Mechanical
Engineering, says: “it is
frustrating to find out that
when a student plucks
up the courage to seek
help…the waiting times
are either long internally
(Counselling Service)
or externally (their own
GP).” Furthermore, due
to the transient nature of
student life, a number
of students will begin
therapy and not complete
it, as they go on holiday or
move away.
Staff are also vulnerable
to mental health problems.
One name that repeatedly
crops up in my conver-
sations with academics
on the pressures they’re
facing is Stefan Grimm,
a professor of toxicology
at Imperial who took his
own life in October 2014.
An inquest later in the
academic year heard how
Professor Grimm was at
the informal stage of the
College’s management
process, following diffi-
culties in obtaining more
grant money; while it is
impossible to say whether
or not action taken by
the College would have
changed the outcome, an
internal review concluded
there should be increased
support for struggling
staff members.
When I speak to Dr
Martyn McLachlan, Di-
rector of Undergraduate
Studies (DUGS) in the
Department of Materi-
als, he says Professor
Grimm’s case brought
attention to “an issue that
had been going on for a
long time, and possibly
still continues in some
places.”
Changes may have
been made on campus
– Rosie tell me the idea
of a work-life balance
is embedded in a way it
wasn’t a decade ago – but
the whole landscape of
higher education is chang-
ing, from the introduction
of government initiatives
such as the Teaching
Excellence Framework,
to the pension changes
that triggered industrial
action last term. The
result is more pressure on
staff – both internally and
externally.
Martyn tells me about
how the ever-increasing
student numbers can
have an impact on staff
pressures: more students
means more teaching,
more examinations, more
marking, more conver-
sations; and the increase
in taught postgraduate
courses, which run over
a 12-month period, mean
staff are often under
pressure consistently
throughout the year.
He also cites the
increase in data avail-
able about academics:
information on how many
students an academic
teaches, how many PhD
students they supervise,
and how many papers
they publish is collected
by the College. While
there is “no direct pres-
sure from the institution”,
he says “there’s always
the thought at the back
of your mind that thinks
‘well, if they have that
data, and they organise
it…what happens to the
person who’s underper-
forming?’”
More generally, there
is the impression that –
while staff and students
are doing a lot of work
to address mental health
problems – efforts are
being hampered by poor
communication. “There
is a lot of good energy
towards increasing student
and staff support,” Rosie
says, “it’s just putting
it all in one place, and
making sure it’s under a
proper strategy.” She tells
me her request to have

hub for students – on the

me, “I'd love to do social
anxiety as well, which I
think is rampant, but not
spoken about. I’d like
to do sleep hygiene. I’d
like to do a mood boost
programme. I’d like to do
a transitions workshop for
students who are coming
in, and going out. I’d like
to go into departments.
There are lots of things I’d
like to do. But we don’t
have the resources. We’ve
got a waiting list. We’ve
got people waiting for
three months. We can’t.”

While it may be tempt-
ing to think of waiting
times as an issue for only
students, the lack of com-
prehensive mental health
support can have a knock-

Network has raised the
profile of student welfare
across the College, and

How the service will
interact with the move to
White City is an unknown
quantity – Rosie tells me
she would love to have
a wellbeing suite on the
campus, for Counselling
and other services, but
that the space has to be
“right: a confidential
space, safe, appropriate” –
as is the impact the move
could have on those stu-
dents who will be leaving
the South Kensington
campus.
The service is cur-
rently putting in place an
online psychoeducation
programme, called Silver
Cloud, which they hope
will be useful, but there
is a desire to do more.
“I’d love to do anxiety
management”, Rosie tells
While the demand has
increased, many of those
I spoke to – staff and
students – believe the
issue is with provision.
As of February 2018, the
Service employs around
seven full time equiva-
lents, including Rosie, to
support a student body of
18,000.
“We need more coun-
sellors,” Rosie says, “The
reality is we don’t have
enough staff to see the
number of students who
are approaching us. Our
increase has always been
retrospective…it’s always
been to deal with what’s
already walked through
the door.”
The issue is not that
there aren’t skilled can-
didates available – the
service typically has
70-150 applicants or
each job – but rather
the funding hasn’t been
made available from the
College: the service has
had its budget frozen for
the past two years.
While the supply side
of the equation may be
clear, the demand side is
not. The number of stu-
dents accessing the coun-
selling service increased
by roughly 80% since
2012, but the number of
students at Imperial has
only increased by 12.14%
in the same time. There
are various theories to
explain the increase: a
reduced stigma around
seeking help; an increased
atmosphere of openness
within the College; an
uncertain and anxious
political environment;

“The lack of
support is

Fintan O’Connor, the
Union’s Deputy President
(Welfare), told Felix:
“The Counselling Ser-
vice’s capacity is clearly
inadequate and Imperial
College Union consist-
ently voices this fact to
the College. The current
level of service, resulting
in average waiting times
of several weeks between
initial assessments and
first appointments, is
Anecdotally, senior
and personal tutors have
reported an increase in
the number of students
seeking advice from
them and applying for
mitigating circumstances.
Several staff have called
on the College to do more
to recognise this pastoral
work, embedding it in
their workload models.
Fintan says the Union
have been working with
Senior Tutors to make sure
all personal tutors receive
appropriate Mental Health
First Aid training. This is
in line with the Union’s
response to the National
Student Survey, which
highlighted issues with
student satisfaction.
“More generally,” he
says, “we’re working with
them to ensure that stu-
dents receive the support
they require from pastoral
care teams, in spite of the
increasing demand they
face.”
The knowledge that the
Counselling Service isn’t
meeting student needs can
have an impact on those
responsible for supporting
students. One member of

rial for a number of years,
and currently lives on the
top floor of Tizard Hall,
in Princes Gardens. It’s a

the years: while it was
