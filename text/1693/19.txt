GAME ON –
IMPERIAL CLUB
EXPERIENCE
PROJECT
‘It’s 2017 at Imperial
College Union; clubs are
abundant and resources
few. Their quests are am-
bitious, but it’s dangerous
to go alone.
Their Union has
devised Imperial Club
Experience Project
(ICXP) to equip clubs
with the tools they need
for development and to
enhance their members’
experience. By complet-
ing a set of goals, clubs
can gain the experience
they need to level up. Club
that opt in will be richly
rewarded.’
At this point anyone
with a penchant for 80’s
arcade games should get
the (dubious) references,
but the real challenge is
extracting meaning from
such an abstract concept.
ICXP – what is it and
how does it affect clubs at
Imperial?
ICXP is a new reward
and recognition scheme
for Clubs, Societies, and
Projects (CSPs). The
idea is that clubs can
gain points for meeting a
series of goals related to
the management of their
group. For example, by
running a Give it a Go
session – essentially a
free or low cost taster or
beginner’s class – a club
will gain five points.
Clubs can build points
spread across five dif-
ferent themes to reach
a total score. Points are
then calculated to define
a clubs’ overall ‘level’ and
the associated rewards.
Many of the goals link
to existing club activity,
like running an AGM or
meeting a minimum of
20 members, while others
recognise clubs that are
expanding their activities,
such as running large
events, trips, or tours.
Benefits to clubs range
from priority location
at Freshers’ Fair to
exclusive development
opportunities and grants.
As a minimum, clubs
will be afforded a unique
badge displayed on the
Union website A-Z; with
nearly 17,000 hits during
Welcome Week, virtually
speaking this is the place
to stand out. Clubs will
also receive certification
and consideration for the
ICXP Award at this year’s
Union Awards on 15th
June. For those that need
extra support, ICXP offers
clubs 1-2-1 development
planning to help map their
long term growth, and
level up to reach the juicer
rewards in the future.
You may be thinking
‘that’s all fine and dandy,
but why now, and what’s
the purpose?’ With such a
diverse range of CSPs it’s
a minefield for students
to understand the ins and
outs of all 370-something
of them, and more impor-
tantly, those which are
well run. From a member
perspective, if I join a club
will it a) be good value
for money, b) provide a
good experience, and c)
even be ‘alive’ still? ICXP
gives students a way to
navigate the maze of clubs
at Imperial, and sets apart
those focused on their
development, and those
simply existing (looking
at you Croquet)*.
CSPs that join now will
have all points backdated
to 1st
August 2017 so
there’s no excuse not
to get involved and see
where you stand in the
leaderboard. In all truth,
we all just want to know
who wins the game of
clubs…
Ready player 2?

IMPERIAL
COLLEGE CHESS
HOLD ONE OF
LONDON’S BIGGEST
TOURNAMENTS
One of London’s
biggest chess tournaments
is hosted right here at
Imperial, and organised
by its number one sports
club, IC Chess. The most
recent edition kicked
off on Friday 20th­
April,
finishing on Sunday 22nd­
.
The weekend got off
to a good start, with
League Captain Ben
Nevett conceiving of a
novel table-arrangement
to maximise the hall’s
capacity, blowing the
minds of all present and
casting doubt on the ne-
cessity of years of turning
players away from sup-
posedly full tournaments.
Round one opened
to an entry list of 95 in
the Union Concert Hall.
Organisation was led by
alumnus John Sargent,
and play officiated by
the legendary FIDE In-
ternational Arbiter Adam
Raoof. Entrants were
split into three sections
(Minor, Major, and Open)
based on ability, with five
rounds to separate them.
This edition saw the
club’s President-elect
FIDE Master Aron Teh,
incumbent Thomas
Donaldson, VP Franc-
esco Salerno, and
esteemed-member Aluna
Rizzoli brave the Open
section, with shock-en-
trant superstar (formerly
ninth in the world
rankings) and prolific
author Grandmaster John
Nunn, raising the average
rating of the section sub-
stantially. International
Master Richard Bates and
two-time Bangladeshi
Woman’s Champion
Akter Shamima rounded
off a remarkably strong
tournament (much to the
author’s dismay).
The President started
off well but saw his per-
formance rapidly combust
and crash in a microcosm
of his academic career
at Imperial, failing to
convert against WIM
Shamima and then losing
to a welcome visitor from
France, Jules Brunier.
Aron suffered a shock
defeat in round one,
before storming into third
place with a streak of four
ruthless wins—including
one over Aluna, who held
onto two points out of five.
Rock-solid as ever, Franc-
esco ended his time on the
committee on a high with
two wins, two draws, and
a single loss. First place
was shared by Dr Nunn
and IM Bates, surprising
no-one, after they paused
their respective massacres
of the opposition to agree
a quick draw in round
four.
For another incredibly
smooth weekend, we’d
like to thank: Kristie
Thacker and the SAC
team for providing the
venue and access to the
SAC kitchen; Adam
Raoof for taking up the
mantle of Chief Arbiter;
John Sargent for returning
as Chief Organiser again
and doing everything that
title entails.
This is IC Chess signing
out for the year, we look
forward to seeing you all
again in October!
