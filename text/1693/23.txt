UCA outdoors –
take two. Taking
place at Lee
Valley stadium
on 28th
April, this was
an incredible event for
ICXCAC and turned out
to be our most successful
ever athletics meet, in
large part due to the enor-
mous number of athletes
that signed up to be part
of the action.
The day began with a
bang, with Noel Rimens-
berger winning the very
first event – the 400m
hurdles. This was then
immediately followed
by a stellar performance
from Alex Mundell, our
club captain, who went on
to win the women’s 400m
hurdles. Imperial also had
victories in many other
events, including in the
3000m steeple chase for
Oliver Newton, the 800m
and 1500m for James
Millet, and in the javelin

and discus for Raul
Rinken. On top of these
great successes, we saw a
strong team performance
in the 5000m, with Harry
Scriven taking third, and
others in the team running
excellent races.
heptathlon), with a 1-2
finish in the men’s event
by Noel Rimensberger
and Jack Mitchell (me)
respectively. The events
included were the 100m,
shot put, high jump, and
1500m. I can confirm that
running a 1500m without
specifically training for it
is a slightly unpleasant ex-
perience, but a rewarding
one, especially given that
it helped me come away
with my first ever medal
at an athletics event!
So overall, another
amazing athletics meet for
ICXCAC. The fact that it
was our best performance
alongside our biggest ever
number of entries just
goes to show how impor-
tant numbers are to our
success. Everyone counts,
as points are earned based
on final position in the
field, so the more com-
petitors we have the more
points we can pick up!
Which is why if you’re
considering giving athlet-
ics a go and would like
a much-needed revision
break, you should come
along to the third and final
LUCA event of the series
at Battersea Park on 26th
May.

Another of our most
successful athletes of the
day was Shaun B Lutu,
who took home victories
in three different events:
the 110m hurdles, the high
jump, and the triple jump.
As you can tell, he’s pretty
good at jumping... One of
the surprise successes of
the day was Imperial’s
