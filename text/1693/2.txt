Imperial emitted more CO­

­than any other university
in the UK last year

Imperial is one of the
worst-performing
institutions for energy
consumption, waste,
and emissions.

T
he level of
g r e e n h o u s e
gases emitted
by Imperial is
higher than that of any
other higher education
provider in the UK. The
College is also one of
the worst institutions for
energy consumption and
water waste.
Imperial was respon-
sible for almost 75.8
million kg of CO2
released
in 2016/17, data from
the Higher Education
Statistics Agency (HESA)
shows. This figure in-
cludes emissions from the
College’s direct fossil fuel
use (such as heating and
the shuttle bus service)
in addition to the CO2
released in the production
of electricity, which the
College then uses.
Imperial consumed
nearly 236 million kWh of
energy, making it the third
largest consumer among
UK universities. This
is an improvement on
2015/16 when Imperial’s
consumption of almost
260 million kWh topped
the list of worst offenders.
In its latest sustainability
report, the College claims
its energy consumption
in 2016/17 was “particu-
larly high” because of
maintenance work which
left the South Kensington
combined heat and power
plant “out of commission”
from August 2015 to Feb-
ruary 2017. The system
has since been moved to
the “more energy effi-
cient” Slough.
Imperial’s production
of more than 60.5 million
kg of waste also puts it
in the bottom three. The
manners in which this
waste was disposed of
are unknown but College
figures claim only health-
care waste – representing
11% of Imperial’s total
waste – is sent to landfill.
be much larger than the
amount of greenhouse
gases it produces directly.
Imperial College
Union's Ethics and Envi-
ronment Officer Rhidian
Thomas told Felix: “This
is yet another disappoint-
ing performance from Im-
perial in terms of sustaina-
bility, in a year that's seen
plenty. The College must
show it takes environmen-
tal concerns seriously if it
hopes for students to do
the same.”
An Imperial College
spokesperson said: “Impe-
rial carries out world-lead-
ing research in energy, the
environment and climate
change. We recognise our
operations and activities
have an impact on the en-
vironment and we have a
responsibility to mitigate
this.”
These figures could
prove embarrassing in
the wake of the recently
published Greening Im-
perial report. The paper
found Imperial is “failing
in terms of sustainability
compared to its peers”
and listed a number of
measures to improve the
College’s environmental
impact, ensuring sustaina-
bility is “comprehensively
incorporated into estates
management”.
98% of students and
staff surveyed as part of
the Greening Imperial
survey thought Imperial
should be doing more for
sustainability and climate
change, while 91% were
dissatisfied with Imperi-
al’s standings compared
to other universities.
Professor Geoff Mait-
land, Professor of Energy
Engineering at Imperial,
and Greening Imperial
co-author, told Felix the
low-carbon structure for
itself and the world.”
Imperial has performed
poorly in analyses of uni-
versities’ environmental
credentials over recent
years: in 2017 People &
Planet ranked Imperial
141st
out of 154 HE pro-
viders and the worst of the
Russell Group universi-
ties. A Felix investigation
earlier this year also
revealed Imperial has in-
vested almost £9 million
in the fossil fuel industry.
The Russell Group
university with the lowest
scope 1 and 2 carbon
emissions was the London
School of Economics
(LSE), whose emissions
were around 13% of those
of Imperial.

“Imperial's
production
of more than
60.5 million
kg of waste
puts it in the
bottom three
nationally”
More than 700,000
kg of CO2
can be added
to Imperial’s carbon
footprint when indirect
emissions are considered.
The HESA data only ac-
counts for such emissions
produced by the supply
and treatment of water.
Imperial is among the
high producers for both
of these metrics, releasing
almost 232,000 kg of CO2
through water supply and
more than 477,000 kg
through water treatment.
Imperial is also the sixth
worst institution in terms
of water wastage – the
College wasted almost
674 million litres of water
in 2016/17 – though again
this is an improvement on
the previous year’s more
than 700 million litres
waste water.
There are many other
sources of indirect emis-
sions, such as greenhouse
gases released during
student and staff com-
mutes. As with many
other companies, the total
value of Imperial’s indi-
rect emissions is likely to

When awareness isn't enough
This Sunday will mark
the end of Mental Health
Awareness Week. On the
surface of things, over the
past few years things have
only been getting more
positive for the two thirds
of us who will experience
a mental health problem
in our lifetime: we’re now
speaking about mental
health more than ever, and
while there is certainly
still a stigma attached to
mental illness, it’s slowly
being broken down.
However, our main
article this week, on the
Imperial Counselling
Service, shows one of
the main problems with
the goal of this week:
awareness is not action.
And while it’s brilliant
for people in power – pol-
iticians, CEOs, College
management – to encour-
age us to speak openly
about mental health
issues, it cannot replace
real-world resources for
those who are in need.
I have been at Imperial
since 2012, and each year
I hear horror stories about
how long the wait times
are for the Counselling
Service. This month, we
decided to start looking
into the situation on the
ground, to see whether
these rumours had any
factual basis. Reports
from the Counselling
Service showed where the
root of the problem lies:
the number of students
who need counselling is
increasing every year, but
the supply of counsellors
is only being increased
retrospectively, resulting
in rising waiting times.
This, however, only
shows us one aspect of
the problem. Over the
past couple of weeks,
we’ve spoken to a range
of people in and around
the College, from students
who have accessed coun-
selling in the past, through
to student-facing staff
members, senior man-
agement, and the head of
counselling herself.
What we found was a
situation that was complex
and nuanced: student
mental health is becoming
more of a problem for a
wide variety of reasons,
including both internal
and external pressures;
this is having an increased
burden on staff members
who want to support their
students, and who are
themselves facing threats
to their wellbeing; people
across the College are
doing great work, but in
the absence of a unified
strategy their efforts
remain atomised.
We’veputtogetherwhat
we learnt in this exclusive
report on mental health at
Imperial. Journalism will
always aim at a true rep-
resentation of the world,
but on a topic as fuzzy and
broad as mental health,
anything we produce will
only be able to cover
a small fraction of the
topic. I hope this serves
as a catalyst for people
at Imperial – not only to
start talking about mental
health, but to actually do
something about it.
Nobody we spoke to
had any bad words to say
about the Counselling
Service itself – I, and
many others, recognise
that they are a small team
of dedicated staff, doing
what they can with the
resources available. But
this needs to change.
Awareness, while it
might be welcome, does
not a functioning support
service make. Reminding
us to look out for each
other cannot make up for
a lack of student coun-
sellors. Encouraging us
to open up to one another
is not a replacement for
funding. Mental health
cannot be on the agenda
for one week out of the
year; it needs to be at the
forefront of the College’s
thinking at all times.
