Under Pressure: Counselling Service hit by

T
owards the
end of the
last academic
year, while
experiencing a number
of difficulties, Claire*
finally picked up the
courage to go and see
Imperial’s Counselling
Service. After waiting a
few weeks for an initial
assessment, she went
along to the counsellor's
office at her appointed
time, ready to talk to
someone about why
she needed help. The
problem she had come
in with, however, turned
out to be the tip of the
iceberg: as the counsel-
lor asked her questions,
further issues were
identified, which Claire
– consciously or uncon-
sciously – had pushed
to the back of her mind.
She then waited another
ten weeks before access-
ing regular counselling
sessions.
“I was disappointed,”
Claire tells me, “That
appointment made me
feel worse, because I had
to talk about my past and
other deep stuff – there
were all these problems I
needed to work through,
and then I was told to wait
for two months. It just felt
unfair.”
While Claire stresses
how much she appreciates
the support the Counsel-
ling Service has provided,
she is now stuck in limbo:
having used up her first
four counselling sessions
earlier in the year, she is
now left with a limited
number to ration until
next year comes around.
“There were a couple of
times where I was feeling
desperate, but then I was
like ‘no, I should wait
until things get bad to use
the session’. But then my
problems aren’t solved. I
need to see a professional.
Talking to friends doesn’t
help.”

Claire was one of
the 1,013 students who
registered at Imperial’s
Counselling Service last
year, and her case is not
unusual. The number
accessing counselling
has been increasing
every year, up from 552
half a decade ago. The
Counselling Service is
located in a nondescript
corner of the third floor of
Sherfield Building, above
the hustle and bustle of
the main walkway; along
a quiet corridor, a series
of wooden doors lead into
rooms where a small team
help students who are in
need. These calm sur-
roundings, however, belie
a service that is coming
under increasing pressure
each year, as more stu-
dents seek out support.
The Counselling
Service is run by Rosie
Summerhayes, a chartered
counselling psychologist
who first joined Imperial
in 2003. Prior to that, she
had experience within the
NHS and another higher
education institution.
Rosie is the kind of person
you probably imagine
when you think of the
word ‘counsellor’: relaxed
and softly-spoken, with
a voice that is both calm
and calming, she answers
my questions about the
state of the service with a
quiet precision.
The service is divided
into two branches: the
Student Counselling
Service, and the Student
Mental Health Advice
Service. Counselling can
be made available for
any registered student,
who will have an initial
meeting with a counsellor
to determine what they
need. Following on from
this, the student will,
if deemed appropriate,
receive counselling. The
service determines who
to see first based on need,
ensuring the most vulner-
able students are seen the
quickest; time spent on the
waiting list is taken into
