Mistaken Identity – how should the left move forward
from identity politics?
Asad Haider’s new book neatly skewers the problems with modern identity politics, but doesn’t go far enough in
offering us a solution.
I
n June 2015, an
interview conducted
by KXLY, a small
news outlet located
in the city of Spokane,
Washington, sparked
heated debate across the
world. For the first eight
minutes, Jeff Humphrey,
the interviewer, speaks to
Rachel Dolezal, president
of the local NAACP chap-
ter, about hate crimes she’s
experienced living as a
black woman in the USA.
In the last 30 seconds,
however, he goes for the
jugular, asking her: “are
you African-American?”
She walks away.
Dolezal, the chair of the
Office of the Police Om-
budsman Commission and
an instructor in Africana
studies at Eastern Wash-
ington University, is not
African-American. She
was born in Montana,
to white parents, and, at
some point after leaving
her parents’ house for uni-
versity, began presenting
as an African-American
woman. The revelation
over her identity birthed
a short-lived cycle of
think-pieces and online
commentary, before
her image was simply
recycled into a series of
memes, which still crop
up from time to time,
with Dolezal becoming a
by-word for the inauthen-
tic appropriation of black
culture and suffering by
white individuals.
For Asad Haider,
a founding editor of
Viewpoint Magazine,
a publication centred
around Marxist theory
and analysis, Dolezal’s
story is emblematic of a
much wider issue within
contemporary political
discourse: the problems
contained within identity
politics. Dolezal exercised
her “sovereign right as an
individual working within
the framework of identity”
when forming her public
persona, and – if we are
to look at why her case
makes us uncomfortable
– we need to analyse what
we mean by identity.
Mistaken Identity:
Race and Class in the Age
of Trump attempts to do
just that, neatly dissecting
the current issues with
identity politics, and
looking to a black radical
tradition to see how the
left can move forward
in the future. In a series
of short chapters, Haider
takes us through the for-
mation of identity politics,
the current problems it
throws up for organisation
and solidarity, and how it
came to develop in this
way.
Haider writes from
personal experience: he
describes his difficult rela-
tionship with the terrain of
identity, with a childhood
that left him “convinced
of the impossibility of
settling on fixed territory”.
Born in Pennsylvania, he
would spend every other
summer visiting relatives
in Karachi – split between
these two experiences of
the world, he settles on
a world-view that does
not fit into the American
paradigm, left without
“anything resembling an
identity”. This confusion
intensifies following the
events of 9/11, which saw
a “culture of condescend-
ing and exclusionary
reactionism” mutate into
an “undercurrent of open
hostility”.
Haider is at his best
when neatly skewering
the most unproductive
aspects of today’s dis-
cussions around identity.
He takes umbrage with
how theoretical ballast
underpinning sociological
and political concepts
has been eroded over
time – intersectionality,
for instance, which
legal scholar Kimberle
Crenshaw based in mate-
rialistic reality, “now has
an intellectual function
comparable to ‘abraca-
dabra’ or ‘dialectics’”.
Those who read the
subtitle of the book and
expect an analysis of how
race or class really operate
under Trump, however,
will be disappointed.
Haider very rarely touches
on Trump, or the reason
he managed to take the
White House, and only
mentions Hillary Clinton
as an example of where
identity politics becomes
disconnected from a fully
realised revolutionary
agenda – a politics wholly
constituted by the idea
of identity, rather than
formed through it.
Any discussion about
political concepts needs
to examine their founda-
tions: you cannot have a
debate about the current
refugee crisis without
asking what we mean by
statehood or borders, and
identity politics should not
be mobilised without an
interrogation of what we
mean by identity. Haider
is aware this can be tricky,
since, in the absence of
“other practical organisa-
tional efforts to combat
racism, any questioning of
the framework of identity
seems like an attempt to
deny the validity of the
antiracist struggle.”
Haider compares
identity politics to reli-
gious fundamentalism,
saying “some choose the
consolations of funda-
mentalism. But others
choose the consolation of
identity”. But he doesn’t
seem to go far enough in
identifying what these
consolations are. He
tracks the emergence of
identity politics in its
current manifestation as a
result of both a black elite
prioritising racial unity as
a means of preventing sol-
idarity among the working
class, and a neoliberal
agenda that divorced pro-
gressive language from its
grassroots base, leaving
it hollow. This is all well
and good, but the popu-
larity of identity politics
within online discourse
must have more to it.
Ultimately, what
frustrates Haider about
identity politics seems to
be how it has become a
substitute for real-world
organisation and action.
Activists have “allowed
politics to be reduced
to the policing of our
language” while “the
institutional structures
of racial and economic
oppression persisted.”
The turn away from a rev-
olutionary nationalism,
which Haider identifies
in the work of mid-cen-
tury black radicals, has
allowed the capitalist
state to absorb their
challenges. To fight back
against Trump, we need
to “provide alternative
visions, languages, and
practices”. Unfortunately,
while this book is a good
start to the conversation,
Haider is unable to offer
us a practical vision of
what this new reality
might be.
