The new Royal Academy places students at its heart
T
he Royal
Academy is in-
extricably linked
to summer in the
capitalby virtue of its most
well known event: the
Summer Exhibition. Each
year works by amateur
artists, those still looking
for their big break, are
exhibited alongside the
work of the established
Academicians: artists
elected to the Royal
College of Art (much like
scientists are elected to
the Royal Society). It is an
exhibition like no other,
with visitors guaranteed
to see work by artists that
they would have never
heard of otherwise.
This laudable support
of emerging artists has
been historically absent
from the rest of the RA
calendar. This is because,
despite being one of the
most prestigious post-
graduate art schools in
the country, beyond the
annual RA Schools Show,
the Academy has rarely
allowed the public to be
privy to the contemporary
art being shaped within its
walls. As a result, outside
of the blockbuster shows,
the RA struggled to draw
in visitors.
All this is about to
change. From next week,
250 years since the Royal
Academy was created,
the New RA is set to be
unveiled.
For the first time, two
RA buildings in the heart
of Piccadilly – one in
Burlington House, and
the other in Burlington
Gardens – will be joined
into a unified campus in
which the public are free to
wander. The merging has
been designed by architect
Sir David Chipperfield,
who, rather than overhaul-
ing the historic buildings,
has staged “diagnostic,
punctual interventions”: a
concrete link bridge here,
a space-transforming
skylight there, to create
a whole that is fiercely
modernist and respectful
of its considerable history.
The expansion will put
the Academy’s collection
on display for free to the
public for the first time.
Visitors will be able to
see works that include
Michelangelo’s Taddei
Tondo, the only marble
sculpture by the sculptor
in Great Britain. Else-
where, the Senate Rooms
have been repurposed as
a permanent gallery dedi-
cated to architecture.
Finally, and perhaps,
most notably, the RA
Schools will be at the
heart of the newAcademy.
Students will rotate
through The Weston
Gallery, a public studio
and workshop, allowing
them to shape their art in
full view of public gaze.
For visitors it will be a
glimpse into the forefront
of contemporary art.
A new light-filled
lecture theatre, modelled
after the Victorian horse-
shoe operating theatre
where dissections took
place for students to learn
anatomy, is the crowning
jewel of the renovations.
Chipperdale will kick
off the proceedings with
an inaugural lecture
next week, soon to be
followed by an engaging
programme of debates
and talks.
The new building is
being celebrated by a free
‘art party’ this weekend,
including printmaking
workshops, food stalls
and live music.
America, vodka, and me: Tori Scott’s raucous cabaret
comes to London’s Vault Festival
H
ailed by
Provincetown
Magazine as
the “Bette
Midler of the new mille-
nium”,Texan-born singer
Tori Scott is renowned for
her confessional, raucous
acts. Normally based at
Joe’s Pub, an affiliate
of New York’s Public
Theatre, Scott came to
London earlier this year
to perform Thirsty at the
Vault Festival.
Thirsty is an hour-long
cabaret performance
detailing exploits from
Scott’s life: from her
teenage discovery of
vodka and their subse-
quent lifelong love-story,
that one time she ended
up in prison, and the
trials and tribulations of
everyday New York life,
she’s ready to share it all
in this comic confessional.
It’s all powered through
with classic songs from
old musicals and sub-
verted takes on modern
hits. Scott’s escapades are
funny to be sure, but what
really brings it all together
are her powerful vocals
and natural self-deprecat-
ing humour.
A running thread
throughout her interac-
tions with the audience are
her references to America
and its political situation.
Whilst we’re all probably
tired of the go-to referenc-
es that make easy fodder
for comedians, Scott
brings a uniquely funny
take to it by drawing par-
allels to her own drunken
misadventures. America
is that good friend who
has had one too many and
lost control. It makes big
issues shallow, but this
sort of thing is in keeping
with the atmosphere of
Scott’s storytelling.
It’s not just the jokes
and funny stories that
stand out in this perfor-
mance, though. Scott is a
truly talented singer and
you can’t deny the power
of her vocals. There are
too many great numbers
to name them all, but
her rendition of Hozier’s
‘Take Me to Church’ and
Janelle Monaé’s ‘Tight-
rope’are amongst the best.
Her performance really
comes to a head in its final
moments with an amazing
version of the criminally
under-performed ‘Wig
in a Box’ from rock
musical Hedwig and the
Angry Inch, followed by
4 Non Blondes’ classic
‘Whats Up’. Ending on
those two stellar per-
formances, there is no
way the audience could
do anything but demand
an encore. It wasn’t just
Scott who’s amazing: she
is backed up by a three-
piece band ‘The Shame
Spirals’, consisting of
musical director/ pianist
Adam Wachter, drummer
Lisa Martin, and bassist
Jamie Wilkins. They are
the perfect foils for each
other, and together they
create a brilliant show.
The Vault Festival
is the perfect place for
Scott, although the par-
ticular stage used, ‘The
Crescent’, isn’t an ideal
choice. Its standard stage
layout with the audience
in rows facing the per-
former seems too conven-
tional for Thirsty which
might have felt more at
