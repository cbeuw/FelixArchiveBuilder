Imperial to bring in ‘virtual counsellors’ to cover
student demand as exam season hits

The College is
investing in a series
of ‘virtual counsellors’
as counselling service
continues to be
stretched thin.

mperial’s student
counselling service
has announced
plans to bring
in a series of ‘virtual
counsellors’ to cover the
increased demand they
have faced from students
over the past few years.
Students will be able
to pick between a range
of virtual counsellors,
which come in a number
of different models: one
variation is a simple
helium balloon with
‘you’re enough’ written
on it, which plays calming
whale songs; another is a
Roomba that has been re-
programmed to be drawn
towards the sound of
crying and blast ‘Happy’
by Pharrell Williams on
repeat.
The move comes as
the service is facing in-
creasing demand. While
the number of students
accessing the counselling
service has increased by
nearly 40% over the past
two years, the service has
had no increase in funding
since 2016, meaning the
current counsellors are
being stretched thin.
Earlier this week, Oscar
Murricane, Vice-Provost
(Making Ends Meet),
announced contingency
plans to help the service
continue to provide coun-
selling to students until
the College runs out of
excuses. Starting from the
beginning of next month,
students will have be pro-
vided the choice between
a 10-15 week wait for a
real life counsellor, or a
two week wait for one of
their new ‘virtual counsel-
lors’.
Murricane told
Hangman: “We rec-
ognise the counselling
service has faced some
difficulties recently due to
increased demand, which
is simply due to more
students being aware of
the service, and nothing at
all to do with the College
wellbeing of our students
and their fees, and have
decided to increase pro-
vision to the service with
a brand-new, cutting-edge
‘virtual counsellor
system’.”
A group of students
were this month testing
the virtual counsellors
as part of a pilot scheme.
Hangman spoke to some
of them about their experi-
ences: Katy, a second-year
mechanical engineering
student, had been seeing
a virtual counsellor for
about two weeks. “I was
a bit hesitant at first,”
Katy told Hangman, “but
I was really desperate
to speak to someone. I
was surprised when I
went into the room and
my counsellor was just

gave him a chance, and
he turned out to be one of
the best listeners I’ve ever
met – much more so than
any friend or loved one.”
Another student wasn’t
convinced, however:
Anthony, a first year bio-
medical sciences student
was paired up with the
Roomba model, but had to
switch to a real-life coun-
sellor a couple of weeks
later. “I’d try and tell it
my problems,” Anthony
told Hangman, “but then
it would just drown out
my sobs with that awful
song. Now every time it
comes on in Metric I have

mperial College
London have made
a number of chang-
es to their policies
surrounding mitigating
circumstances, follow-
ing the release of Mar-
vel’s Avengers: Infinity
War.
The policy changes,
which were implemented
during the summer exam
season, an unusual move,
came into effect last week,
following approval from
Provost’s Board.
As well as clarification
over the process for miti-
gating circumstances, the
policy outlines a number
of new reasons for obtain-
ing them, which mostly
seem to revolve around
Infinity War. Alongside
reasons like ‘bereave-
ment’ and ‘mental health
problems’, students will
now be able to apply for
mitigating circumstances
because of: ‘the ending of
Infinity War being ruined
for me by some jackass
on Reddit who didn’t use
the spoiler tag’; ‘extreme
stress following having
to explain who everyone
in Infinity War is to an
elderly relative’; and ‘too
much time spent catching
up on all the Marvel films
I missed and not enough
time revising’.
The move followed
an increasing number
of students approaching
student services with
Infinity War-related con-
cerns. William Dablay,
Vice-Provost (Ambi-
tious Crossovers), told
Hangman about some of
the rationale behind the
decision: “Just following
the release of Infinity War
we had a number of stu-
dents cite existential con-
cerns over Thanos obtain-
ing all infinity stones as a
reason for potential poor
performance in upcoming
exams. I presumed they
were all experiencing
some kind of break with
reality, until my son
explained, at length, what
the film was about. Given
the sheer volume of Infini-
ty War-related complaints,
we decided to alter our
policy mid-term.
The changes to the
policy have some notable
omissions, however:
Nathaniel, a third year
Imperial student, was
upset the policy made no
mention of Black Panther.
“If I fail my biomaterials
exam, it’s not going to be
because of Spider Man or
any of that bullshit,” he
told Hangman, “it’s going
to be because Wakanda
doesn’t exist in real life.”

Imperial to include Infinity War spoilers as mitigating
circumstances
This week you’re excited
the weather has improved
enough to break out your
summer short-shorts. You
get arrested for public
indecency.
This week they ask you
how you are and you just
have to say that you’re
fine but you’re not really
fine but you just can’t
get into it because they
would never understand.
This week you try and
use disappointment at
the new Arctic Monkeys
album as mitigating
circumstances. It
succeeds, surprisingly.
This week you’re
the Deputy President
(Education). SACAs
are finally over, and
you’ve got nothing left
to distract you from
the meaninglessness of
existence.
This week you finish your
last exam at Imperial, but
let’s be real: every day
is a test with your social
skills.
This week you’re
confused about how the
College can produce so
much wastewater when
all the Central Library
toilets are fucked.
This week you go along
to Union Council, and
it’s just like your sixth
birthday party: nobody
turns up and you can’t
stop crying.
This week you finally
get a counselling
appointment, but you’ve
been waiting so long you
can’t remember why you
were sad.
This week you seriously
overestimate your
tolerance to the sun.
Don’t worry, when the
skin peels, there might be
a tan underneath!
This week you decide
to chill out in the sun
on Queen’s Lawn in full
view of people taking
an advanced computing
exam. You monster.
This week you’re the
Horoscopes Writer, and
we’ve still got four of
these issues left to do?
You’re bleeding me
fucking dry.
