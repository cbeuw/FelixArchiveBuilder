Beach House return with lucky number 7
The dream-pop band’s latest work sees them developing their sound, embracing a more aggressive palette, while
retaining their charm.
W
hen the
new Beach
H o u s e
album, 7,
came out on Friday, the
first thing I did in the
morning was take a walk
through Hyde park and
listen to it. Back home,
Beach house was THE
band I would listen to on
long and moody walks
through the forest, and I
thought it fitting that I give
7 a whirl in the closest
approximation to a forest
I have here. Listening to
the band in nature just
fits. Watching the leaves
swivel in the wind helps
internalize the poignant
lyrics and the hazy sounds
with which Beach House
have become synony-
mous. The weather was
overcast and the wind was
blowing – everything was
perfect.
Now, I have to admit
that I hadn’t been
convinced entirely by the
singles leading up to the
album. ‘Lemon Glow’had
all the right characteristics
of a great Beach House
song: the slow synth intro,
subtle and intimate lyrics,
and the characteristically
soothing delivery of
singer Victoria Legrand,
arguably the best vocalist
in dream pop. But the next
two – ‘Dive’ and ‘Dark
Spring’– seemed like they
signalled a slight depar-
ture from the sound I have
come to know and love.
‘Dive’ seems to me to be
one of the most aggressive
sounding Beach House
songs yet. Alex Scally’s
guitar has a surprising
fuzz and an edge to it and
the final flourish kicks
the drum machine into
overdrive. ‘Dark Spring’
did not make sense at first
either. Their songs usually
tend to envelop your soul,
to attempt to slowly coax
you to resonate with their
melancholy.Their practice
space is entirely coated in
white fur for fuck’s sake,
you can’t expect this band
to force any feelings on
you. But that is how I felt
about what would turn out
to be the album opener – it
felt forced.
all of their songs sound
the same but their sound
here is much denser than
in any of their previous
work. Listening to their
older songs I could always
imagine my thoughts
and feelings bouncing
between the stratospheric
synths and the grounded
rhythm of the drums, they
just felt like they were a
mile apart. This album
does not let you do that.
There is much more going
on. There are more layers,
the production is cleaner.
Whereas they previous-
ly made incremental
changes to their sound,
here they have taken a
bigger step. The duo may
have taken a chance with
this change but it was not
only in sound where they
changed things up.
Many question the
relevance of art, espe-
cially in today’s world,
where recycled political
messages permeate
everything in order to
assert the work’s rele-
vance. But art need not
be relevant in a way that
makes it obvious for
everyone. It must protest,
it must placate, and it
must be some sort of
shining light for someone
out there. It must simply
be true to life. And there
is something about the
extra pinch of darkness in
this album that sums up
the disillusionment that
many feel today without
actually saying it.
I don’t want to just
ramble on about the
abstract feelings I get
while listening to the
music. I have their words
from the album to back
it up. First of all, there
seems to be a running
theme of the number
seven in the story of this
album. The first single
came out on 14/2, and
the total number of songs
the band have recorded
was brought to 77 after
the album’s release. The
song ‘L’Inconnue’ speaks
of seven girls, and lastly,
of course, the name of
the album. As seven is
considered to be the queen
of lucky numbers, at least
in western culture, you
would expect there to be a
theme of the supernatural
in the album. I feel it only
serves to act as a contrast
to the very real stories that
Victoria’s beautiful voice
tells. Likewise, I perceive
the gloomy lyrics as a way
to highlight the beautiful
in their songs.
The contrast of “Straw-
berries in springtime /
pretty, happy accidents”
and “On a hillside, I
remember I am loving
losing life” wants to
ground us. To remind us
that life has a bright side,
that we should not get
caught up in the bad, that
every melancholy must
serve as a springboard for
happiness, and that this
imagery to highlight the
bright and beautiful, this
brilliant lyrical chiaroscu-
ro is best encapsulated in
the lines: “Little girl, you
could be loved / Little
girl, you should be loved /
The moment you say you
know / Is the moment you
are.”
One of my friends
made a joke once that
Beach House is driving
music for the heavily
sedated (if this were true,
we’d probably see Tiger
Woods endorsing them)
and I feel that this album
changes that impression.
It probably went under the
radar due to Tranquility b
Base’s release the same
day. Beach House aren’t
about that though. They
keep it on the DL. Slightly
dirtier this time though...

Over the zebra crossing
I went, and into the park;
I started listening. Oh boy,
did the opener change
my mind. The last lines
of ‘Dark Spring’ sum up
the ominous setup that
the song creates in the
context of the album.
“The world’s colliding
/ A new dividing / The
colour’s missing / Upon
the dark spring”. 7 is like
no Beach House album
before it. It. Is. Better. It
is probably not different
enough from the rest to
satisfy those who say that
“‘Lyrical
contrasts serve
to remind us
that every
melancholy
serves as a
springboard
for happiness”
happiness comes from
inner peace and self-love,
highlighting what we
should strive for in life.
I feel that this duality of
using dark and broody
Shô! it’s come to this: jazz fusion from Marseille
T
here’s this guy
on YouTube
called Marcel the
Drunkard, and he
does really spiffy speed
watercolor paintings. He
does them to fusion/neo-
soul albums, then uploads
the video and the music
to go along with it. The
guy’s neat, and the albums
are abshô!lutely splendid.
His latest video featured
a jazz fusion ensemble
with ambient, proggy un-
dertones – Shô! (sho1 on
bandcamp), who’ve just
put out a new album, also
called Shô!. Shô!, let’s get
to the nitty-gritty.
Shô! is a band from
Marseille, on the southern
shô!re of France. From
what I can tell, there’s not
much of a scene there;
probably just some venue
called Le Jam or some-
thing (side note: I actually
looked it up, and there
really is a place called
Le Jam in Marseille, and
yes, it’s a jazz bar). Either
the jazz revival is going
international now, or
these guys were just some
oddballs that came out of
nowhere. Either way, I’m
happy the album landed
in my hands. I’m no
pushô!ver when it comes
to music, but this left me
shô!ok, dazed and amazed
like a kid in a toyshô!p.
There are two threads
that run through the
album, “Just a Beginning
Part x” and “Spatial Night
Part x” for x in 1, 2, 3 (last
term zonked me, friends).
JaB is the start and the end
of it, but it always shows
up with its counterpart,
isolating the two singleton
cuts, “Cloud Drummer”
and “Sho!”. The album is
cohesive; the surprise cuts
give a rhythmic shô!ve
after the spaced-out (uh),
mellow “spatial night”
cuts. JaB shô!ws off more
active, driving melodies
- some even sounding
nearly math-rocky in their
tone and construction, and
providing a nice counter-
point to the shô!egaze.The
singletons build off both
these themes, displaying
different dimensions of
the band’s burgeoning
technicality.
And the band have
chops. While some
might jump ahead or fall
behind, nobody ever feels
ishô!lated from the jam.
There are some great
chords laid down on
Cloud Drummer; “Sho!”
has a wonderful shifting
grô!ove with a fantastic
cross-section of layered
instrumentation - the
musicians duck in and out
of phase with each other
in a polyrhythmic jumble
that nearly respects a 4/4
pulse. And the shô!cking
tempo drop 3 minutes
in kicks ass - the sloshy
guitar reminds me of the
last Fleet Foxes album - at
near 5 minutes, it’s slowly
enveloped by a gorgeous
keyboard harmony slowly
swelling up from the
guitar’s shadow; when the
keys dominate, the song is
over.
The EP did feel a little
shô!rt. But for a first shô!t
at an album from the (ap-
parently fresh) group, it
was remarkably cohesive
and nicely technical;
overall, a very enjoyable,
very promising piece
of work. See you at the
shô!w!
Ólafur Arnalds at his absolute best
W
hat a
wonderful
evening at
the Royal
Albert Hall! Ólafur
Arnalds, one of the most
successful artists signed
by a minimalist record
label–ErasedTapes–gave
a memorable performance
to a sold out crowd at the
iconic London venue last
Monday.
The concert was
opened by Manu Delago,
an Austrian Hang player.
Ephemeral sounds of three
Hangs, complemented by
some subtle electronics,
resulted in a perfect
opening act for what we
were about to experience.
Ólafur Arnalds brought
with him on this tour a
string quartet, a drummer,
and two self-playing
pianos that play sequenc-
es of notes generated by
an algorithm in response
to the chords played by
the Icelandic musician
on another piano. The
algorithm also controlled
some of the lights on the
stage. Pretty cool! The
key element in Arnalds’
music is his sparse piano
playing, with long notes
coming from strings and
gentle electronics. This
time the sonic landscape
was extended by the
sound cascades from
self-playing pianos, and
drumming, which added
nice dynamic to the show.
The concert was rather
quiet and sometimes
required the audience to
stay absolutely silent and
focused to be able to hear
barely audible murmur
elicited from the violin.
The atmosphere in the
majestic Victorian audi-
torium was very intimate.
Not only was it due to
beautiful tunes played by
brilliant musicians, but
also Arnalds’ charming
personality. The minimal-
ist composer seemed to
be flabbergasted by the
legendary status of the
place and humbled by
the enthusiastic reception
from the audience. Things
got emotional when he
dedicated one song to the
couple in the crowd who
got engaged that evening.
It culminated at the end of
the concert, when, after
the first encore the band
left the stage, Arnalds,
with a trembling voice,
thanked his family who
flew over from Iceland
to watch his performance
and dedicated the very last
song to his late grandma.
He then sat behind one
of the pianos and started
playing a very quiet
and moving piece ‘Lag
Fyrir Ömmu’. Halfway
through, he was joined
by the strings played by
his bandmates backstage.
The sound was kind
of muffled, as if it was
coming from a different
world.
That was a magical way
to end a great concert.
I had tears in my eyes.
Nothing else could be
played after that. Arnalds
proved that evening
that he deserves all the
accolades he receives.
He showed that he is a
mature artist who is aware
of every single sound
coming from the stage
– or even from behind
it – and is not afraid of
experimenting. We were
presented with a lot of
new material on Monday
and it made me truly
excited about the new
album. The whole perfor-
mance was probably the
best thing I have heard
from him so far – it was
Ólafur Arnalds at his best.
That guy looks shôcked. Shôcked, I tell you! // Shô!
