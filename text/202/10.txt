CARNIVAL
Queen
1964
Who will be this year's glam-
orous success to Marion for the
title of Carnival Queen 1964 ?
This year's competition is
again open to all members of
I.C.W.A. and female members of
staff.
Nominations need a male pro-
poser, and must be in the form
of a photograph of the nominee
together with a profile outlining
her chief claims to the title. The
nominations must be delivered to
John Churchill (Maths III) or to
the Carnival Office (Weeks Hall)
by the end of term.
The four most glamorous of
the entrants will receive free tic-
kets to the May Ball, where the
final judging will take place
under under a panel of distin-
guished and unbiased judges.
All entrants will receive a con-
solation prize. So gals, don't be
shy about persuading your
favourite guy to nominate you.
And men, if you see a potential
Queen, moving about College,
ask her her name and what she
does, write the profile and we will
get her photographed !
Find her age
Dogs Mead is a famous old
English puzzle. Although it re-
lates to a farmer, his family, and
his land, it involves a good deal
of engineering maths, and logic.
The problem is to find the age of
Mrs. Grooby, Farmer Dunk's
mother-in-law. You must not
assume the puzzle was invented
this year : when was the problem
written ?
You'll need to know that there
iare 20 English shillings to the
pound sterling, that an acre is
4,840 square yards, a mile is
1,760 yards, and that a rood is a
quarter of an acre. Also, these
hints help: One number in the
puzzle is the area of Dogs Mead
in roods, but it relates to_ some-
thing in the puzzle quite different
from that area. One of the num-
bers across is the same as one of
the numbers down. So here you
are.
Across
I. Area of Dog's Mead in square yards.
5. Age of Farmer Dunk's daughter, Martha.
6. The difference between the length and breadth of Dog's Mead,
in yards.
7. Number of roods in Dog's Mead times number nine down.
8. The year when Little Piggly came into occupation by the Dunk

10. Farmer Dunk's age.
II. , The year Farmer Dunk's youngest child, Mary, was born.
14. Perimeter of Dog's Mead in yards.
15. The cube of Farmer Dunk's walking speed in miles per hour,
16. Number fifteen across minus number nine down.
Down
1. The value of Dogs' Mead in shilling per acre.
2. The square of Mrs. Grooby's age.
3. The age of Mary.
4. The value of Dog's Mead in pound sterling.
6. The age of Farmer Dunk's first-born, Edward, who will be twice
as old as Mary next year.
7. The square of the breadth of Dog's Mead in yards.
8. The number of minutes Farmer Dunk needs to walk one and
one-thirds times around Dog's Mead.
9. See number ten down.
10. Ten across times nine down.
12. One more than the sum of the digits in the second column.
