You all no doubt read in the
last issue of Felix the appeal by
" Voluntary Service Overseas "
asking for young graduates who
would be prepared to spend a
year or more extending a techni-
cally helping hand in one of the
developing countries. While
hoping that this appeal has all
the success that it deserves one
realises that the majority of us
will not be able to respond to it
or at least not for another one or
two years. There must, however,
be many who would like to en-
gage in some such service in this
country.
RACIAL H A R M O N Y
The Commonwealth Service
Group was set up specifically to
tap this enthusiasm. It is a group
of young people in the 17-25 age
range who offer their services to
promote racial harmony in this
country. This work takes place
of necessity mainly among immi-
grants. The Group tries to
achieve its ends by three main
methods: (1) Learning more
about Commonwealth countries
from lectures and films at
monthly meetings, (2) Working
for immigrants, (3) Attracting
Commonwealth young people in-
to the Group and so working
with, as well as for, overseas
members of the Commonwealth.
(This last method has been singu-
larly unsuccessful in that the vast
majority of members are natives
of this country.) Currently the
main work undertaken by the
Group is the coaching of semi-
literate and numerate immigrants
in English and Maths, although
we also decorate homes occasion-
ally, and at the moment are try-
ing to organise a discussion club
in a South London College.
Membership of the Group is
open to any member of the
Commonwealth. If you would
like more details please contact
me via the maths letters rack.
(Huxley Building.) I would like
to mention, to avoid misunder-
standing, that this is not an I.C.
society.

TO
EUROPE
Imperial College is making an
important one-man contribution
to Britain's fourth European
Seminar, taking place at West-
field College from April 6—13.
He is 25-years-old Peter Hills,
M.Sc, who will be seminar vice-
chairman and head of social
committee. The job is an appro-
priate one and Peter Hills was
specially asked to do it.
For, besides being a lecturer in
transport engineering at college,
he also runs, in the summer vaca-
tion, the London International
Students Club, which he founded
in 1961. Modelled on those in
Scandinavia, it makes Imperial a
hospitable centra ] for foreign ex-
change students during London's
empty eight weeks.
Peter Hills' work at the semi-
nar will be " much the same as
at LISC, only more concen-
trated." In one week he will
direct a committee of five to look
after about 200 participants from
at least 22 countries.
P E R M A N E N T B A R
This will involve accommoda-
tion, catering and entertainment.
For the seminar, whose theme
"New unity for an old civilisa-
tion?" will make it a series of
high-powered discussion, will also
have a lighter side.
There will be a permanent bar
service (" only reason I took the
job!"), a dance, an informal
party and an outing to Eton and
Windsor.
Peter Hills will also arrange for
facility visits to such places as
British Aircraft Corporation dur-
ing the seminar.
The B A C visit, which will in-
clude a look at the much-
heralded VC10, is just one aspect
of the scientific content, being in-
troduced for the first time.
There will be a permanent
study-group on science and tech-
nology, whose findings will go
into a final report to be read in
influential circles from Iceland to
Turkey.
Leading its 15 members from
technical faculties all over Eu-
rope will be a London expert on
aeronautics, since air and space
co-operation will have top
priority in discussions.
TOP N A M E
And a top name in Europe's
space programme will address
the seminar. He is Mr. M . N .
Golovine, M.B.E., F.R.Aes, vice-
president of Eurospace, president
of the British Interplanetary
Society and executive director
of Hawker-Siddeley Aviation
Limited.
Other technical aspects will be
a talk by a spokesman of the
European Coal and Steel Com-
munity, as well as films on the
Channel tunnel and road plan-
ning. Peter Hills is arranging
this one himself.
Organisers of the seminar,
which has backing from the
Government and west Euro-
pean organisations ,is a planning
group set up by the European
Society.
Two Imperial College students
have been active in the Society
itself. Ron Hass, aeronautics V .
used to be its treasurer. And

licity officer.

children, the daily release of
adults for education and the use
of visual aids. To-day they pro-
vide liberal and vocational educa-
tion for adults and are developing
the education of the 15—18 age
group in apprenticeship schools
and junior leader units which are
very close to being residential
county colleges.
The officers accompanying the
exhibition were extremely
friendly and all said that they
were deeply impressed with the
atmosphere in this "real univer-
sity " and that they found all
students very courteous. Major
Harper, ex-president of Durban
University, seriously said that the
food in the upper refectory was
the best and cheapest he had
sampled out of 27 Universities.
