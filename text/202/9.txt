JUDOCLUB
British
Champions
The club achieved its biggest
success of the year when the 1st
team won the British Inter-Col-
legiate Championships, held at
U.L.U. on February 15th. Three
teams were entered from the
Club :—
1st Team: R. Bedding, K .
Dugdale, D. Watson.
2nd Team : C. Cohn, P. Mc-
Glone, P. Hunt.
3rd Team : P. Drury, D. Payne,
Prescott.
The first team convincingly
won their pool and then went on
to beat Regent Street Poly in the
semi-finals and Q.M.C. in the
final. The 2nd and 3rd teams did
not meet with the same success
and although both fought well,
neither managed to win their re-
spective pools.
Hyde P a r k Road Relay
IT'S GEAR
Liverpool's Year
On Saturday, February 22nd, Cilia Black held the No. 1 spot
in the hit parade, Liverpool F.C. took another step towards the
league and cup double and the " gear " boys themselves caused chaos
at London Airport when they arrived back from America. With
all this going on, few papers indeed found space to record that on
the same day Liverpool University walked off with the major college
road race of the year, the Imperial College Hyde Park Road Relay.
P u r s u i t
True, this result was not en-
tirely unexpected, since Liverpool
had beaten the might of London
and Oxford at the BUSF cross-
country champs, only a few
weeks before, but it was in doubt
right up to the final lap. At the
last changeover Liverpool were
leading with Bristol second and
Loughborough third.
John Whetton of Lough-
borough, a near four-minute
miler, took off in hot pursuit,
soon passed Taunton-Rigby of
Bristol and closed steadily on
Jackson of Liverpool. Jackson
was well on his way to the fifth
fastest individual time of the day,
however, and Whetton, seven
seconds faster and third fastest of
the day, could do no better than
close the gap between them to
eleven seconds at the finishing
line.
CROSS COUNTRY
FOUR'S A CROWD
Fixtures tend to get somewhat
hectic at this time of the season
and, with four major races in the
last week and a half, this year is
proving no exception.
On February 5th there was a
strong field down at Petersham
for a home match between
Borough Road, London Hospital,
Goldsmiths and ourselves. Bor-
ough Road, with the first three
home and only 19pts., were easy
winners; next came I.C. and
Goldsmiths with 60pts. each—
I.C. getting the verdict on " goal
average."
R E C O R D
A week later we travelled to
Epping for the S.W.E.T.C. (spelt
South West Essex Tech.) trophy
race where our 1st team was 9th
—just behind Goldsmiths this
time. In this race Pete Yates
(U.C. and getting faster all the
time) set a new course record of
21-56s.
On the Saturday (15th) we sent
a smallish team to Reading where
we convincingly beat their even
smaller team of three.
However our lads must have
run hard because in the trial held
on the Tuesday, to select our
team for the Hyde Park, times
were much slower than they
should have been — they im-
proved on the day though.
RELEGATION
The next day brought a league
I match—.Petersham again: we
hardly seem to go anywhere else,
these days—and, not appearing
to feel the strain too much, our
1st team ran well and stayed
clear of the fight for relegation
(our 2nd team is already odds-on
favourite for that).
And finally to the Hyde Park
itself—we finished 31st as last
year, but turned tne tables on
Kings who slipped from 30th tc
32nd.
THANKS
The organisers would like to
thank all those members of the
college who helped to make the
Relay a success ; also Pete Crews
and I are very grateful to every-
body who worked so hard at the
Hop afterwards.
SPARKES CUP
The last three Wednesdays of
term are given over to the
Sparkes Cup. As yet no firm
favourites have emerged.
Guilds captained by P. Darkins
boasts many players with I.C. ex-
perience but one wonders if he
can build them into a fighting
unit.
Mines under D. Wakelin are
the dark horses and with a back
row of Turner, Tax and Coxall
they must be a force to be rec-
koned with.
R.C.S. under A . Turner have
very strong outsides with Chop-
pell and Caudwell on the wings
but seem weak at forward. Only
Ravno and Havard have 1st X V
experience in the pack.
W a r C r y
As the Liverpool team received
the Sir Roderick Hill Cup and
their medals from Lady Hill after
the race, supporters chanted the
Merseyside war-cry " Liver-
pool," of Anfield fame and fol-
lowed this up with a few im-
promtu " Yeah, Yeah, Yeah's."
Queen's College, Cambridge,
for whom D. M . Turner ran a
record fastest lap, once again
won the Imperial College Union
Cup for colleges with less than
500 male students. This they re-
ceived for the fourth successive
year, after the now nationally
famous eleventh hour confession
of "double running" by a theo-
logical member of the Christ-
church College, Oxford team.

His fooball honours
are many—Captain of the Uni-
versity, Bristol University caps;
Sussex County, A.F.A., F.A. ap-
pearances. He will be playing in
his sixth successive final, having
already secured five winner's
medals. With a player of his

possible.
BASKETBALL
POINTS TOP THE TON
I.C. Basketball Club entered
the semi-finals of the Diana
Trophy—a cup competition for
Clubs in the London area—with
a convincing 118—55 win over
St. Andrews.
The match turned out to be
one-way traffic in the first half
and at half-time I.C. had a lead
of 56—.12. The team slackened
off in defence during 2nd half
and allowed St. Andrews to score
freely.
To snow we were not tired
after this effort, we proceeded to
thrash a combined Chelsea and
Wormholt team 67—31 with a
break of 3 minutes between the
games.
