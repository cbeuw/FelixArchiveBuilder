dear s i r . . .
the outmoded view that fornica-
tion is wrong per se, now that
more sophisticated methods of
birth control are at hand, is simply
to invite ridicule.
However, I will admit that be-
fore premarital or extramarital in-
tercourse can be defensibly in-
dulged in two essential conditions
should be fulfilled, viz. (i) that
some form of permanent or semi-
permanent relationship exist be-
tween the two parties concerned
and (ii) that intercourse be freely
desired by both parties. Only
when these two conditions are
fulfilled, I believe, can it be mor-
ally justifiable to indulge either in
fornication or adultery.
To reject all forms of sexual
experience outside of marriage
unequivocally is to totally disre-
gard one of the potentially greatest
and beautiful things that the-
human race can aspire to and is
morally quite indefensible. And
let it never be forgotten that chas-
tity outside of marriage must
inevitably go hand in hand with
the evil of prostitution. Until men
realise that a responsible attitude
to sexual behaviour does not con-
demn out of hand those unable to
live in a state of self-imposed
asceticism and learn to see their
sexual indulgences as a necessary
and vital factor in our human con-
dition, then inevitably much suf-
fering must continue to result
from our own pitiable lack of
understanding of our fellow men.

Dear Sir,
Since I have started reading
Felix (1957) there have been seve-
ral ups and downs in the standard
of the articles and even more fre-
quent changes of editors and
policy. Though I do not agree
with all that has been written this
year I have no hesitation in saying
that at long last, though perhaps
sometimes too controversial for
some people, Felix is an interest-
ing and well written paper.
The mam reason for writing
this letter is two-fold and concerns
two items that appeared in recent
editions and the storm of protest
they have caused by the so called
righteous and virtuous. Needless
to say I am referring to ' Under-
sexed' and the photograph on the
back of the 100th Edition.
One could say that the photo-
graph was perhaps a little daring
and that some of the conclusions
implied in that article rather odd,
but to suggest that they do not
expect such obscenity to emanate
from the minds of morally respon-
sible beings who should be stop-
ped from propogating this sort of
moral depravity, etc. is rather pa-
thetic.
All that I can say is that it must
take a very warped mind indeed
to conjure up a view of such de-
pravity and obscenity. From the
cries of horror of some of the
letters one gets the impression that
just by reading the articles masses
of students are going to carry out
the most vile deeds and start lead-
ing an immoral life. Most people
have their own moral standards
and I feel sure that no person with
any self respect will change his or
her behaviour so radicalfy just

career prospect
for teachers
Male graduates and qualified teachers
are needed to teach as officers in the Royal Army Educational Corps.
Service in the R.A.E.C. offers:—
* A salary of up to £1,500 by age 27 as a married captain, and, if on a
regular or limited service engagement, a salary of £2,000 by age 34 as a major.
* Full seniority on the Burnham scale, enabling officers to return to civilian
teaching, should they decide to leave the service or on retirement.
* A varied life with the chance to serve in Hong Kong, Cyprus, Malta,
Gibraltar and many other stations.
* Teaching at all levels, from remedial to degree standard, and to all age
groups: children; adolescents; and adults.
Types of commission available:—
Regular. Open to graduates under 25. This offers career pros-
pects to the age of 55, with a pension of £1,000—£1,600.
Limited Service. Open to graduates and qualified teachers under
39. This offers i pension and tax-free gratuity of £585 and £1,755
respectively after only 16 years service.
Short Service. Open to graduates and qualified teachers under
43. This is granted for an initial period of 3 years, which may
be extended to 12, and earns a tax-free gratuity of £180 for each

Graduates serving on Limited or1
' Short Service Commissions
have the opportunity of transferring to regular commissions.
If you are a graduate, a qualified teacher,-or hold equivalent technical
qualifications, write for full details to:—
The Director of Army Education, (TL/69/A), War Office, (AE1), Stanmore, Middz.
Women with suitable qualifications are required in the WRAC for duty
with R.A.E.C.
because they have read one short
article or looked at a photograph.
Surely the whole point of com-
ing to University is not just to
learn a few formulae but to learn
how to think and be prepared to
face life in the wide world. If
students' actions and morals are
to be dramatically influenced by
that article or the photograph I
just hate to think what they will
become in a few years when they
have to work in industry.
Sir, may I conclude by saying
that though I have not always
approved oj the view expressed
in Felix I congratulate you on a
veryfineeffort indeed and if as
one can gather "a head must roll"
over editorial policy, I for one
hope that it will not be Felix's.
I suggest that in Felix's next
awards list you include the "Honi
soit qui mal y pense " to certain
imaginative individuals.
Yours faithfully,
S. R. KLAT, P.G. Mech.Eng.
Dear Sir,
In reply to last issue's envious
physicist, we, as frustrated PGs,
would like to point out that.it is
cash that most people look for
in preference to any number of
diffraction gratings, whose value
in- pawn-shops is very little.
Yours sincerely,

mothers union
Dear Sir,
I have just attended the Union
meeting held on Thursday, 20th
February, and I feel impelled to
make a few comments concerning
the way in which the meeting was
run in general and also about the
last motion — that concerning
Felix.
Rarely can a Union meeting
have been so badly handled.
Amendments, which were not
amendments, but purely an ex-
cuse for the proposer to add more
" humbug " and " jumble " to the
already chaotic proceedings. I
am sure that it is a good thing to
have an active Union with varied
points of view, but let us try and
keep speeches to the point of the
motion—this is the duty of the
chairman and should be strictly
enforced—and let us try and have
Union meetings which resemble a
reasonably dignified debating
chamber and not a disorganised
Mothers Union meeting. On one
occasion a member of the Union
did not have the courtesy to stand
up and address the meeting, but
continued to have private discus-
sion with Mr. Watson. When, as
a result of calls from thefloor,he
was asked to stand, he failed to
apologise and also failed to turn
round so that he could be heard
by the rest of the meeting. I
would like to point out that I am
not blaming the individual, but
rather those whose job it is to see
that meetings are held in an intel-
ligent fashion.
As regards the Felix debate, I
