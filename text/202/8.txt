dear s i r . . .
don't think I have ever seen such
a clear case of bumbling bureau-
cracy as that shown in the speech
made by Mr. Watson. It seems
that the panacea to all the ills of
Imperial College Union should be
solved by adding one or more
members to the committees,
boards and councils. Oh when,
oh when, will people realise that
one should not increase the num-
bers making up these bodies.
Granted there may be cases wher,
changes in the composition o)
of such committees as the Union
Council may be necessary, but
why not do away with those posi-
tions which have become obsolete
first ?
With these thoughts in mind,
surely the most potent argument
against Mr. Watson's suggestions
for the Felix board, which in-
cludes a fair proportion of Union
(Jouncil, was that far from further
saddling this active, healthy and
popular part of the college life
with a " super editor " we should
ask for the removal of all those
members of the board who do not
take active part in the preparation
and compilation of the. paper.
Make the board smaller and more
manageable and we wiFt have an
even better paper.
As regards to the safeguards of
such a system, surely they are al-
ready in force. The editor of
Felix can be called before a Union
meeting and censored. In fact,
some six years ago an editor was
quite rightly removed from his
position for producing a heavily
politically biased paper.
In conclusion, let us try and keep
Imperial College out of the
clutches of involved constitutions
and keep the number of commit-
tee members down to a minimum.
Yours sincerely,
D. L. PENTZ.
GIRLS!
Dear Sir,
With reference to the letter
from " The Girls of Physics II "
in your last issue, may we point
out the following: —
1. Make up either non-existent
or worse still, apparently applied
with a putty knife.
2. Cigarettes dangling (dain-
tily?) out of mouths or between
fingers.
3. Hair styles which, like
Topsy, just growed.
4. Extreme colour clashes —
clothing, (lime green and navy
blue, black and purple])
5. Affected accents and giggles
which would disgrace the average
schoolgirl.
As the Girls of Physics II they
should bear in mind their privi-
liged position and dress and act
accordingly. -
The Long and the Short
and the Tall
Physics II.
ED: Perhaps Long, Short and
Tall would like to meet Chit-chat
Nit-chat and Bit-chat in some
quiet place.
Will it all seem worthwhile
5 YEARS FROM NOW?
At Turner &. Newall we give a considerable
amount of thought to the question of a man's
future. And our graduate training scheme is
planned to be adaptable to his individual needs
— to employ and extend his attainments to the
full.
You May Know Our Name But . . . just to
remind you - we are not only the dominant
asbestos group in Britain, we also have a large
and growing stake in plastics, in insulation, in
mineral wool, and in glass fibre . . . all adding
up to a £100,000,000 business with some
40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man
scope. Yet, because each of our nine British
companies largely runs its own affairs, not so
big that the essential 'human touch' is
endangered.
This balance is reflected in our executive
development training which, far from tying a
man down to any one type of career —.
production, sales, administration - allows him
time to discover his true potential.
This way, we invariably find that the graduate-
assumes managefial responsibility more con-
fidently - and certainly earlier - than is usuat
in a modern industrial complex.
