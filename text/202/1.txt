Changes Through
At SecondAttempt

WATSON FAILS TO TAME FELIX
After two hectic Union meetings on Tuesday, 18th February,
and the following Thursday, two important things were achieved:
the first was the authorisation of important constitutional changes
involving the election of a deputy president, a halls of residence rep.,
and changes in the method of electing the hon. sec; the second was
the " Felix " motion.
The passing of all these motions represented, in the first case,
a victory for common sense over irresponsible elements on the Union
floor, and the second a victory for common sense over the upper
hierachy of the Union.
In fact the Felix motion was lost before it even came to the
floor. Watson must have realised this, for he watered down the
original motion considerably, and simply proposed the establishment
of an independent arbitrator over the editor. The sole purpose of
this I.C. " Ombudsman" would have been to order the editor to
include in his newspaper material that he, the arbitraor, would have
judged to be of general interest to Union members. This, of course,
sounded reasonable enough, until Watson himself pointed out the
vagueness of the proposals and Mike Combes stressed the abso-
lute necessity of not tampering with the editor's freedom. He added
that not only would any editor worth his job feel unable to run a
newspaper under such a restriction, but as the editor was appointed
by the felix board in the first place he should presumably have
their fullest confidence.
Fortunately the highly personal
nature of this motion was not ex-
ploited to any great extent. It
was regretted, however, that
Gopal Srinivassen tried to bring
this up. Credit must be given to
Watson for proposing such a
hopeless motion so eloquendy,
and for steering well clear of
personalities.
DEPTHS OF DULLNESS
Tuesday's debate on the con-
stitutional changes has been
much criticised for its appalling
handling, its timing and for the
apparent attempt to bulldose
the changes through. The depths
of dullness were probed by the
proposers, and it was not difficult
to side with the more emotional
speeches from the floor. Havard
and Airey, with their highly con-
trasting motives and methods,
were particularly, effective in
stressing, firstly, that "Inner
Circles" were not too happy
about the whole business, and
secondly the " anomalies " in the
methods of elections.
TACTLESS REMARKS
Dave Loftus, in a well-timed
speech, probably did more than
anybody else to defeat the
motion ; not forgetting Gravette's
unfortunate and tactless remarks.
Even Watson was surprisingly in-
effective—'his characteristic clear
thinking was marred by an ob-
vious air of desperation.
On the Thursday, the motion
was debated in parts after it had
been rejected on the Tuesday by
a paper vote. Watson gave him-
self the privilege of speaking
most of the time, and was ex-
tremely effective. A l l the mo-
tions were carried and, in direct
contrast to the previous fiasco,
the various objections that arose
were easily passed over. As
everybody had expected all along,
the changes were accepted.
