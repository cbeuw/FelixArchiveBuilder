A K I L D A R E F O R IMPERIAL
Earlier this term Felix published an article on the status of the
Engineer, which showed that so far Guildsmeu are not as such socially
acceptable. Many will agree that the appeal of engineering is not
all that it might be and one often hears a student at a party explain-
ing that he is an engineer and then apologising—" It helps to pass
the time" or " a means to an end."
The article suggested that something could be done to accelerate
the process of educating the public concerning the real significance
of the Engineer. Mr. Jones offered, quite seriously, the suggestion
that a technological hero be created on the lines of Kildare or Barlow
in Z cars. He has further written to ask if we at Imperial College
would be interested in doing anything about it. A production with
an Engineer in the lead and his work as a background to dramatic
situations sounds more than plausible.
A 30 minutes film along these lines would be a tremendous chal-
lenge to the dramatic society, film society, and photographic society
and give them an opportunity of creating something lasting. Were
the film of reasonable quality then either B.B.C. or I.T.V. could
well be most interested and might even offer financial support. Here
is an idea which apart from providing a tremendous challenge, will
contribute enormously to future generations at Imperial. If anyone
is interested in such a project then please see me, Room 73, Beit
Hall.
A previous idea for a film of I.C. was scrapped for lack of finan-
cial support. Any filmgoer will know that there are hundreds of
amateur groups throughout the country making films (some of them
very good) on a shoestring. With an aim as definite as this one
financial backing should not be difficult to obtain.
GROTTY
With the arrival of the word " grotty " and its widespread use,
has come a totally unconnected, but most appropriate phenomenon.
Grotty Advertising. Although the standard of advertising around
College is inherently high, its positioning can only be described as
grotty. Boards are provided, but now posters are stuck to walls,
doors, and windows. This habit of putting your notices anywhere
was probably started by the executive when publicising Union meet-
ings. ;•; Now it is everywhere, in the Union, in the Halls, and in the
refectories—even party organisers find it necessary to plaster un-
sightly bits of paper anywhere but on the noticeboards. The South-
side stomp organisers have gone one better by issuing stickers which
appear on walls, cars, woodwork and the tubes. These are very
difficult to wash off and have considerable nuisance value—very little
else.
Something should be done about this, and Wardens, Union
officers, and Society promoters should unite to stamp it out before
our buildings became grottier and more unsightly than they already
are.
RIGHT SECOND TIME
Congratulations to Mr. Watson who after a nightmare first
Union meeting showed us how in a brilliant second. A well-known
American President once demonstrated his formula for success with
a piece of string on a table—" If I push it, it folds up, but if I pull
it I can lead it where I please." Last ThursdayYUnion Meeting
was a case in point. Working behind the scenes is all very well, but
what this place needs is a bit of real leadership ; let us not have a
repeat of that shambolic Tuesday. One interesting point however,
is that it is unconstitutional to propose a motion from the Chair and
so in fact our widely heralded changes may not strictly be law; Mr.
Watson did not mention the actual precedents he claimed ! Perhaps
he meant Mr. Chandmal's example in the N.U.S. debate last year.
\OPERA
The College is very fortunate
in being able to draw musical
talent from the dark cellars of
R.C.M., and mixing this with our
own, produced a lively and well-
sung performance of the Gondo-
liers last Thursday week.
The opera's satire, however,
was never intended to extend as
far as the orchestra pit—on this
occasion it did. The wind sec-
tion's intonation and tone quality
was often sadly lacking, and the
horn player, despite his best in-
tentions, rarely confined himself
to the narrow limits set by the
Composer. One can sympathise
with the orchestra having to play
for someone else's opera, but it
is unfortunate that they had not
spent more time in useful re-
hearsal

was unfortunate that her Duke

to compensate his vocal short-

heavily overplayed the clowning.

" I say, I say, I say ! Who was
that lady seen wandering into the
I.C. Bar last night ?"
"That was no lady, that was
Charley's Aunt," and she is
about to be done by the Drama-
tic Society for their next produc-
tion.
Conceived by Brandon Thomas
(that well known author of
"Charley's Aunt") she became
one of the funniest comedies of
the Victorian era, running for
four years at the Royalty
Theatre, a fantastic run for that
period.
It is the story of the pecuniary
aspirations and peculiar desires
Catalysed by the retarded ap-
pearance of a Brazilian mil-
lionairess at an Oxford College,
and her impersonation by an un-
dergraduate with a fascination
for skirts. This hilarious situa-
tion results in numerous near-
catastrophic incidents. Many
proposals of marriage also add
flavour to the already boiling
plot.
The title role is played by
Mike Smith, president, of ICDS,
who said of his part—" I'm no
ordinary woman." The two un-
dergraduates are played by Chis.
Masterman and Geoff. Wright,
those two well known, well
dressed undergraduates. Glamour
is provided by Lesley Slater, Jill
Burnet, Maragaret Moon and
Carol Melville. Support to the
above is ably given by Alan
Auchterlounie, Andrew MacTier

March 10-13th inclusive at 7.30,

on the whole jt was an amusing
