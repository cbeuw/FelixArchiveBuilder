If the women can have a Birds-
nest, I see no reason why the men
of I.C.—even if they are not Pil-
lars of society—should not have
a column in Felix ! In the very
last issue, the Girls of Physics II
were complaining about the oiks
who " tramp " around : I know
Birdsnest has said that Navy is
all the rage, but is it really neces-
sary to look as if you had just
been run down by a destroyer ?
(Those who say, Yes," are ex-
cused from reading on.)
Still in vogue is last year's style
in trousers: the leg is slightly
bell-bottomed, slightly nicer than
the trousers usually seen around
here, which seem slightly clap-
pered. Don't forget, colours
should be exciting for the drab
winter months: contrasting shirt
and pullover can enliven a lecture
theatre; might I suggest finger-
nail black, and Mooney-meatball
green.
And remember, you do not
have to look well-dressed : M . &
S. (Manure and Sackcloth) spell
economy, so don't imagine that
just because 1964 is a leap year,
you can wander round looking
flea-ridden! Man, you can't
start a romance from scratch.

ON SCRUTINY
The eleventh edition of Scru-
tiny, published last Wednesday,
has again cut overall a good im-
pression. Slowly the layout con-
tinues to improve, though the
cover was disappointing in its
unoriginality. Particularly in-
teresting were its views on recent
college affairs. But the issue, as
a whole, appeared to fail in its
aim as " a forum for views on
politics, religion, philosophy, and
social questions," concerning it-
self with day-to-day topics, which
should be more suitable for a
magazine like Phoenix. But this
is a fault not of Scrutiny, but of
the I.C. students for not contri-
buting the right sort of material.

"Give up the luxuries of life
and we will dispense with its ne-
cessities." '
Delighttul as Norman Hart-
nell's Spring Collection was, I
wonder whether the Icwarians
who saw it during the last few
weeks will agree completely with
J. L . Motley's words. For the
Hartnell Collection was strictly
for the wealthy sybarite and
tnose, such as ourselves who,
having less to spend on clothes in
a year than the price of just one
of the dresses shown, nevertheless
enjoy the titillaiion of the fashion
senses and basic guidance that
can be extracted from just such
an exhibition of a master crafts-
man's work.
The clothes were in true Hart-
nell tradition with fine attention
to detail and a certain amount of
lavish embroidery and beaded
trim on the evening wear, yet the
general impression was curiously
disappointing. There were a few
eyecatchers. in particular a coral
shantung suit with a matching
white spotted blouse and hat (ob-
viously aimed at the Ascot mar-
ket, from its name "Spot the
Winner"); and a fabulous even-
ing dress called " May Week " in
pale blue silk with a matching
bearded trim along the high
waistline and a small train. How-
ever, the majority of the garments
are memorable more for their de-
tails and trims rather than for
their overall impact.
In the whole, an interesting
afternoon, that is, not intensely
memorable but which showed us
that Hartnell still leads in the
production of well-made stylish
clothes which, although expen-
sive, will influence to some not
inconsiderable extent, what we
will be wearing this year.
