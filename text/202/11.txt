The 1 1
Yank's go home" debate at the Union on
27th. Feb, was l i v e l y and l o u d , and the
presence of Guildsmen ensured that nothing
serious was s a i d that could p o s s i b l y em-
barass our two very amicable American
v i s i t o r s , Bob Higgins and John Swaney.
I t was extremely fortunate t h a t Guilds had
agreed to turn the debate i n t o t h e i r Union
meeting f o r , before they a r r i v e d ( 10 mins
l a t e ) , o n l y 25 people were spread out over
rows of empty c h a i r s . I t i s hard to under-
stand why the debating s o c i e t y should be
f l a g g i n g , f o r Gordon H a l l and B i l l Macauly
steered a very w i t t y and mannerly m i d - l i n e ,
although they were both incomprehensible
at times. .Perhaps sherry parties, are not
such a good idea before debates, Of the
two v i s i t o r s , John Swaney was undoubtedly
the most accomplished, and one f i n i s h e d
with the impression t h a t not only was
Gordon H a l l a s y p h i l l i t i c , but the Oscar
Wilde was an iimerican. N a t u r a l l y , i n the
l i g h t o f these two f a c t s alone, the motion
was defeated overwhelmingly.
