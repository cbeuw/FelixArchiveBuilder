d e a r s i r
sex
explanation
The Editor, Felix,
Dear Sir,
As (the author of the recent
article in Felix entitled" Under-
sexed," I should like to reply to
my critics. Reactions have ranged
from"" How can you equate in-
terest in sex with sexual inter-
course?" to simply " It should not
have been published," and a few
people took the opportunity to
point out that intercourse outside
marriage is wrong. The whole
point of the article was that if
one takes into consideration the
Social, moral, religious, and en-
vironmental aspects of the prob-
lem, they still cannot explain the
difference in figures between Ox-
ford and l.C. Surely it must be
obvious that even at Oxford there
are students who think that inter-
course outside marriage is'wrong,
and that one cannot equate in-
terest in sex with sexual inter-
course. When comparing the
figures I was not debating these
facts, but saying that in spite of
all the above considerations there
still seemed to be an unexplained
factor based most probably on the
background history of the average
l.C. student. This factor seems
to me to be most definitely an
"absence of feeling" (definition
of apathy) towards sex, I did not
pass judgement in the article as
to whether this is a good or-,a bad
thing. Some students seem to be
so brainwashed that when one
mentions sex they react disap-
provingly, without even trying to
see what the discussion is all
about. Mine was a sociological
and not a moral conclusion. As
to the criticisms that such articles
on sex should not be published, I
can only say that if sex cannot be
discussed at University, then
where can it ? Readers are re-
ferred to an article in Punch
(Feb. 5th) on sex at Oxford.
Finally I would like to add that I
have revised my figures. Those
for men and women at I.C.
should be five per cent, higher
than quoted previously, and those
for Oxford should both be at
least ten per cent, higher. The
unexplained factor looms larger
than ever now.
Yours respectfully,
PETER A. RIDING.
go ahead
Dear Sir,
We do not believe in an apos-
telic succession extending to Mr.
Sheridan—"fornication is wrong"
—nor do we accept God, Christ
or their teachings. Consequently
we were amused by the recent
mild obsenity in Felix (we are not
immune to dirty jokes) and con-
curred with many of the ideas of
UNDERSEXED.
The few Christian dogmatists
(Phillips, Sheridan, Ellis et cd) be-
come offensive when their cen-
sorious attitudes extend beyond
the limits of their personal rela-
tionship. We enjoy fornication
(it would be surprising if we
didn't.)—and accept this as suffi-
find the time or inclination io con-
jure up such useless accusations
from trivial and harmless ma-
terial.
Yours,
DAVE HUNT
prattlings
Dear Sir,
1 was greatly amused, in your
last edition, by the prattlings of
our angry virgins. I trust that they
will follow the advice of their
good book and keep their lamps
well filled and neatly trimmed,
just in case . ..
To become more serious, how-
ever, 1 would like to point out
that there are a large number of
people in this college who, like
myself, believe in moral concepts
different from the Christian ones
and who probably believe in them
just as strongly and adhere to
them just as strictly as any Chris-
tian does to his.
If the Christians in this college
desire to retain the respect of the
rest of the college I would suggest
that they express their fiery evan-
gelism in a form more acceptable
to intelligent audience.
Yours sincerely,
HUGH FRAZER.
anti s e x ?
girl punched
Dear Sir,
I would like to lodge a violent objection to the behaviour of
certain members of I.C. arising from an incident in the Union bar
on the evening of Feb. 25th.
A group of Bedford girls entered the bar with the express intention
of collecting for the U.L.U. Carnival (which, after all was initiated
for the same purpose as the I.C. Carnival). After a short, sharp
scuffle they were forcibly ejected—fair enough you may sayl
However, the manner of their removal was far from that expected
from any member of the superior sex when dealing with females. The
use of fists should be restricted to the gymnasium; perhaps the particU
pants were overcome by the proximity of the Liston-Clay meeting
It is notable that mvasions by other male colleges are seldom
repelled effectively; the use of such rough-house tactics should be re-
served for such occasions.
To emphasise the harshness of the methods used and if possible
to promote some sense of guilt in the maladiusted persons responsible
may I finally quote the example of one girl who was punched in the
face, thrown to the ground and kicked as she lay there.
I.C. is noted for its isolationist policy—surely even that cannot
excuse such extremist behaviour. m. V. WHITEHEAD
Dear Sir,
I was sorry to learn from the
last issue of " Felix" that even
I.C. harbours its quota (relatively
insignificant, I trust) of the anti-
sex school, i.e. those who regard
anything connected with sex as in-
trinsically dirty, obscene and im-
proper. Even sex within marriage
one suspects, is to be viewed as a
necessary evil. In the words of
one of your correspondents "sex-
ual intercourse outside marriage
is wrong (my emphasis) and many
religions and societies forbid it."
I wonder whether your corre-
spondent realises that the reason
for such religious sanction of pre-
marital chastity arises simply from
the fact up till the present century
no other really acceptable alterna-
tive form of birth control has
existed? To continue to support
cient justification. (Indeed any
long-term sexual activity not in-
cluding intercourse is abnormal—
we believe). Debate from "moral"
"ethical" "scientific" "religious"
or " intellectual " stareapoints is
interesting, but essentially unhelp-
ful.
If you want intercourse—go
ahead. We are fortunate to live
in a society where this is permis-
sible, and where contraception is
easily available and efficient.
Everything is tolerated, provid-
ing it remains concealed;—we
would therefore (regretably—but
Authority is unpredictable) sign
ourselves—

exasperated
Dear Sir,
I was exasperated by some of
the correspondence in your 20\st
edition. Mr. Phillip's suggestion
that the harmless, though well-
known cartoon is a propagation
of moral depravity seems to me
to be an example of a warped
sense of values coupled with
extreme narrow-mindedness.
The sketch depicting the cele-
bration of the 200th edition of
Felix was of course interpreted by
Mr. Ellis as a disgusting booze-
up.
I fail to comprehend how stu-
dents in responsible positions can
