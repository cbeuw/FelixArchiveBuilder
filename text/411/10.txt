IC on form
Kingston Grammar School 4
Imperial College 1st XI 2
KGS H A V E A reputation for
hockey. Make no mistake,
half a dozen international
schoolboy caps a year
speaks for itself. So it
was with some trepidation
that IC left the changing
rooms. The pre-match chat
by B i g J i m included details
of our new t a c t i c s ; man for
man marking in the 25,
4:3:3, with the centre
back acting a s a sweeper.
After 15 minutes of play
no-one had settled to the
new system and we were
two goals down, one a rising
rocket of a shot that leaves
Charlie wishing he had h i s
face mask on (at least!),
the other a penalty. Our
play improved as A l a n Brown
and A l i s t a i r R o s s took
control of the midfield,
winning plenty of ball and
distributing it w e l l . IC
began to play well and a
break and cross from the
right met Bob Middleton, who
beat the goalie at the near
post.
Our i m p r o v e d play
continued in the second
half, indeed we hit a
'purple patch' during which
a cross from the left allowed
'Superstar' to score a
superb goal to make it
2 - 2 .
However, fate and the
Umpires were not with u s .
Many good chances were
squandered and IC succumbed
to defensive t a c t i c s for the
last quarter. The defense
played w e l l , but a contro-
versial penalty and a
penalty corner s e : t l e d
the i s s u e .
Team: C Brown, K Houlden,
J Marshall (capt), J Cooke,
A Ross, A Brown, H Magnay,
T Tutu, R Fatania, B
Middleton, J Latter.
IC saves a point
Imperial College XI 2
Smiths 2
IC G O T O F F to an
excellent start against the
League Leaders scoring two
goals in the first five minutes.
Bob Middleton converted a
Trev Tutu cross and then
A l i s t e r R o s s slotted the ball
in from the edge of the 'D1
.'
The play in the rest of the
first half w a s even, with
both s i d e s coming c l o s e
to scoring. However just as
IC had struck quickly in the
first half, so Smiths equalised
with two swift goals just
after the interval. Smiths
then began to apply intense
pressure to the IC defence
but were unable to put the
ball in the net. IC looked
in trouble when the Smiths
umpire awarded h i s own
side a penalty after missing
a blatant obstruction by
one of their players. However
justice was done, when
Charlie Brown palmed the
ball away and saved IC a
point. Smiths, pressing for
promotion, were perhaps the
more s k i l l f u l side, but this
was balanced by the running
and work rate of I C ' s two
inside forwards Mike Isles
and A l i s t e r R o s s . A Special
Mention must be made of
John Andrews whose excellent
umpiring was appreciated
by all concerned.

So near...
T H E P O T H U N T I N G season
began in earnest on Wednesday
4th F e b . L a s t year at the
St Edmund H a l l relay at
Oxford IC managed the
s i l v e r medal position, so
this year they were looking
for gold. The relay c o n s i s t s
of four laps of the 3 mile
course around the gravel
paths of the University
parks. Steve Webb ran the
1st leg for the ' A ' team
and " w a s extremely worried
for the first mile or so
because A l f Garnett running
the 1st leg for the ' B ' team
was well in front. However
at the end of the lap the
teams were in correct order
but separated by only 20
seconds. David Rosen held
8th position for the ' A ' team,
c l o s e l y pursued by Paul
C l a r k e for the ' B ' team
retaining 12th position.
Still separated by only 25
seconds Rob A l l i n s o n and
A l a n Leakey took over for
the ' A ' and ' B ' teams
respectively. Rob anxious to
avenge defeats by A l a n
at orienteering and spurred
on as the leading teams
began to fade, pulled the
' A ' team up from 8th to 2nd
position with a time of 14.00
(pity it wasn't 13.95 e h ? ) .
That could be the fastest
lap of the day; (official
conformation is still needed.
A l a n consolidated the ' B '

on Friday lunchtime. The IC
1st team ( m i n u s Rob
(unavailable A l l i n s o n ) plus
a few o.thers headed north
disguised as a University
of London A team for the
British Student Championships
at Stirling. Eight hours, a few
bars and a chip shop later
saw them at Stirling U n i v e r s i t y .
The race, 3 laps of a
ZVi mile course that w a s
in esserise just a lap of the
campus w a s won by Ray
Smedley of Birmingham
University in 36.17, who as a
result, won half a ton of
medals, cups, beer, whisky
plus a medal for the person

The first race of the term
takes place at Reading
tomorrow. It is the Harp
Larger competition which
the first eight won last
year; they hope to repeat
that performance. A l l eights
are competing including the
women, so it should turn
out to be a Memorable

It is a l s o rumoured that
Tirian (the U L second
eight) failed to form a pair
and so J o e Shrinkneck has
been coaxed back after a
years absence. The circum-
stances of Paul Languths'
return are probably best
left unrecorded.
The second eight continue
to cause alarm with a tendency
to, w e l l , (how best to put
this?) - take advantage of
tactical leads when rowing
against the firsts. What is
certain i s that the position
of 'fastest crew' will not
automatically be left to the
first eight.

team run by holding 12th
position. Ian E l l i s (capt)
set off on the last leg not
far behind first position
but was told by Rob in no
uncertain terms not to
attempt to catch him, as
the lad now in 1st position
was another well known
farmer from S L H . The teams
waited with baited breath
for Ian to return, and were
disappointed to find he w a s
in 3rd position as he entered
the last half mile. H e w a s ,
however, on the shoulder of
the man in 2nd place, who
was now looking rather
worried. A t the appointed
place 200m from home Ian
opened up and smoothed h i s
way into 2nd place to the
cheers of the IC teams.
Dave J o n e s had h i s glory
too, lifting the ' B ' team from
12th to a final position
of 11th.
Meanwhile the ' C team
were fighting a rearguard
action. Mike Welford had
led them off well and Pete
Johnson returning to fitness
raised their position to put
them 24th and well off the
bottom. Nigel Miller
lost this place by unfortunately
taking the wrong turning,
but Andy Davey feeling
strong after a restful week
held 25th position finishing
the ' C team with still 3 or
4 teams behind them!
