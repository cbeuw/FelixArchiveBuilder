" It's your Union,
it's up to you."
PROFILE: Peter Teague
A F R I E N D once remarked that he
first met Peter in their first ever
Mathematics lecture at IC, and h i s
immediate impression was that Pete
was destined to be a leader. T h i s
was in September • 1972 when Pete
arrived, a green Brummy fresher -
since then, he has not looked back.
However, he disarmingly denies
that it was ever his intention either
to be R C S president or ICU president;
"I came to C o l l e g e and I was going
to get a first, pure and simple. I was
going to enjoy my Mathematics, and
that was going to be my lifestyle. I
a l s o wanted to take part in the s o c i a l
life — that is when I started to do
things in the H a l l of R e s i d e n c e . "
H i s plans were finally shattered
at the end of his first term. "It soon
knocked into me that I wasn't going
to get a first, and also that Mathematics
at University was very much different
from the Maths I'd done at s c h o o l ,
far more intense, and I couldn't spend
as much time on it as I'd initially
thought".
So, Pete settled down to take part
fully in C o l l e g e life and thoroughly
enjoyed himself, a process that has
been continuous to today in his role
as ICU President - " a job that is not
entirely what a lot of people t h i n k " .
A s he sees it, it is a multi-faceted
job, but he has found one aspect of it
rather disappointing: the length of his
term of office.
" A n y C C U president should be
there, in my opinion, first and fore-
most as C C U president, and secondly
as V P of I C U " .
" O n e of the first things I learnt when
coming into office was how short a
year i s . I went to the Bristol Sabbatical
Officers' Conference and the first
thing I realised was how little I could
change in a year, how few concrete
things I could look back on and s a y ,
" t h a t ' s because of m e " . That has
been re-enforced by the fact that a
lot of things coming to fruition this
year were started by Norman Sayles two
years ago. But I enjoy the job.
" I ' v e found, though, that it is
a lot of work, and a lot of it revolves
around the office. You tend to get tied
to the office very m u c h " . Consequently,
he has not been able to meet as many
people as he would have w i s h e d . In
this sense, he feels he was better off
as R C S U president — a role which is
drastically different from that of ICU
President, although ICU is very important,
a coming together of the C C U ' s , he
s t i l l feels that " a n y C C U president
should be there, in my opinion, first
and foremost as C C U president, and
secondly as V P of I C U " .
Pete received a traditional education;
he went to the local primary school —
in the next road — and then on to a
local grammar s c h o o l , where, incidentally,
he took O-level music and art. A
bright student, he passed out of grammar
school with four A - l e v e l s , in Maths (2)
Economics and P h y s i c s . He then had
to choose between Mathematics and
Economics — he took the former - a
choice which he sometimes wonders
about.
Since coming to IC he has not been
able to pursue music or art, although
he still s i n g s , o c c a s i o n a l l y , in the
church choir when he goes home. (He
used - to play the saxophone in the
school orchestra, but he gave up on
coming to IC.) " T h e only extra-
curricular activity I've pursued s i n c e
coming to IC was Dramsoc, which I
joined in my first year. T h a t ' s how I
got to know John Downs — we both
started in Dramsoc at the same time
as f r e s h e r s " .
"...I would like to think I could be
reasonably s u c c e s s f u l " .
An organisation Pete was actively
involved with for many years is the
British Red Cross Society, of which
he is s t i l l a member (he joined when he
was ten years old). A s an officer of
the B R C S he visited Finland on an
international work-camp, and he has
maintained contact with his friends in
the B R C S - this Easter they are off
on a barge trip around North Wales.
H i s immediate ambition, on leaving
IC i s , as he puts it, " t o carve myself
the beginnings of some sort of career
and settle down to living in London
outside of Col l e g e . "
" A s for long term prospects, it
is difficult to tell until you've gone
out and settled down, but I would like
to think that | could be reasonably
s u c c e s s f u l , " he s a y s .
Pete likes to enjoy himself, and
is well known as a socialite throughout
C o l l e g e . H i s reputation has landed
him in one or two unfortunate situations,
the most memorable of these being at
last year's Smoking Concert.
Earlier, he and A l Littleford (a
great friend) had declared " a l l out war"—
sugar in bed, U— bends, etc — on each
other. At the Smoking Concert, Pete
exercised what he terms " p r e s i d e n t ' s
prerogative" and became somewhat
inebriated in an attempt, he s a y s ,
" t o make the evening a little bit
different." He was subsequently
'pushed—dragged' onto the stage with
the stripper, who then said she would
like someone e l s e on stage, and Pete
dutifully obliged by singling out A l
to her, and he too made his impromptu
debut.
"When he (Al) got halfway up on
stage I said, 'there you are, A l , you asked
for war, you got war.' After Smoking
Concert we decided to call a permanent
t r u c e . "
"It looks as if IC will decide to stay
in (NUS), but I think for all the
wrong r e a s o n s " .
" A n o t h e r time was when Stan
Arnold, the infamous cabaret artist,
came to do the ICWA freshers dinner
last year, and stayed in my room. A l
had done me in that night, taken my
U—bend off. But then he (Al) had an
unusual fit of c o n s c i e n c e and climbed
back into my room and screwed the U—•
bend back on again, but couldn't get it
on properly. Stan Arnold went off to
my room after the cabaret, and he'd got
a stinking c o l d . Half an hour later
he d e c i d e s to take a couple of a s p i r i n s ,
turns the cold water tap full on, and
gets water all over his feet. Stan
Pefer Teague, ICU President
takes his aspirins and leaves a note on
the sink, " D o not use this sink —
U—bend l e a k s . "
" S o I got back and went to bed. I
got up, had a wash (in the bathroom)
and disappeared off to lectures next
morning. I told Ian Redwood that Stan
was sleeping in my room, to wake him
up and give him a cup of coffee. So,
Ian went back, but the sign had d i s -
appeared from the sink. Ian walks into
the room, and before Stan can say
anything Ian has gone over to the sink
and turned the tap full on — water
everywhere. Ian turns the tap off and
goes out to the landing and borrows a
sponge from the cleaner, and mops all
the water up with it. Then he wrings out
the sponge into the sink "
Pete became actively involved in
R C S U through helping Ron K i l l build
the R C S Rag F l o a t . Then, as he puts it,
he got " c o n n e d " into becoming R C S
Ents chairman, in his second year,
by S&D Puppeteers — " t h e big e l e c t i o n -
riggers in R C S in those d a y s . T h e i r
place has been taken K J Productions
this y e a r s . "
But he feels that elections have
come round all too soon. Although he
will be reluctant to go, it is important,
he s a y s , that there is a change every
year, because it is a job which c o n -
stantly needs new ideas and a new
approach — stagnation would otherwise
be a p o s s i b i l i t y .
The Union has been run this year
in a very b u s i n e s s - l i k e manner, and
this, Pete concurs, helped give the
U G C visitation a good impression of
the U n i o n . The strategy of giving
academic problems priority in d i s c u s s i o n s
was something which pleasantly surprised
them. " T h e y were also pleased to see
that as well as the academic s i d e ,
which apparently a lot of student
unions don't talk about, we were not
constantly throwing at them, to quote
Sir Frederick Daniton, the Chairman of the
U G C , " t h e N U S l i n e " .
H i s opinion on the N U S topic is
that " i t looks as if IC will decide to
stay in, but I think for all the wrong
reasons — these reasons being fears
about losing N U S s e r v i c e s , such as
T r a v e l . IC would also stay in because
they think that they need, that students
need, a national negotiating body, which
is right. Students do believe that. But
I don't see that it necessarily has to
be a body with the structure of N U S
at the moment.
