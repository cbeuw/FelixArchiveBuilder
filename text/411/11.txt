Rowing
Last Saturday, having
(ho! ho!) rowed past the
second in a four minute
piece, the first eight had
quite a fight to pass the
novice crew, who for a
moment looked like holding
the first off until the end.
They were beaten however
due to the s i z e of the British
Imperial Minute which
brackered us all in the end!
Thankfully that was the
last piece before lunch.
And talking of tomorrow,
there's a big party on in the
boat house to which all are
welcome. P h i l Goldsmith
s a y s it's going to be better
than the last one which was
pretty Memorable. — N B high

Orienteering
Wet, muddy
and hard going
T H E F E W WHO have ever
experienced 9am on a Sunday
morning will sympathise with
IC Orienteering C l u b as
they journeyed to Camberly
in the rain. The damp caused
a few cock-ups when we
copied down map corrections
and the check points, due to
the disintegration of the
now soggy maps and biros
c e a s i n g to function.
A s to the event itself.
Well it was wet, muddy and
fairly hard going, due to
clumps of gorse bushes and
thick heather. A l a n Leakey
had a reasonable run to
finish in 94min. for the
10.8km ' A ' course. Rob
A l l i n s o n made a few detours
in his 108min. run and Pete
Johnson did well for his
119min. Our star orienteer
Dave Rosen was performing
in Stirling at the B U S F
X—Country match as was
Steve Webb. H i s place was
taken by the indestructable
Ian Isherwood who chundered
round in C i r c a 168mins. Wilf
Welford thought the ' A
course to be beneath him
and so ran the ' B ' and finished
it in a little over two and a
half hours. Our only woman
athlete was Diane Benge who
tried the womans ' B ' course
but got lost. However she
managed to make it to the
pub first, along with Rob
and Pete who gave up waiting
for Ian and Wilf to come
back. A pleasant pub crawl
in the evening was enjoyed
by those who stayed behind.

H A P P Y D A Y S are here again!
It was the A ' s best performance
of the season. The team
needed some confidence-
b u i l d i n g after recent
disappointments and that
was provided in full measure
by Martin Cotter. A l l through
the match confidence grew,
reaching a peak in the last
twenty minutes when four
tries were scored.
The first half was fought
c l o s e l y . Barclays Bank
scored first. A penalty near
the A ' s line gave them an
easy try, which they converted.
However, the A ' s had the
measure of the Bank almost
from the outset; it was only
a matter of time before that
was reflected in the score.
The first of Martin C o l t e r ' s
three penalties was quickly
followed by a well handled
move on the right wing which
put Dave Bramley over for
one of his two tries. Two
penalties, one for each
side, gave the A ' s a slim
1 0 - 9 lead at half time.
T|?e second half showed
how well the A ' s can play.
The backs moved the ball
around confidently, and the
forwards won the b a l l ,
e s p e c i a l l y in the scrums, with
consummate ease. Dave
Bramely then got his second
try. But, the man who broke
the Bank w a s Martin Cotter.
After his third penalty the
A ' s knew that it was their
game. In the last twenty
minutes it was a question
only of the number of points
the A ' s would be ahead at the
end. Play never left the
B a n k ' s half, with the A ' s
dominating completely. C h r i s
Becque led the spree.
E x p l o i t i n g a gap in the
B a n k ' s cover he nipped
through to score. Martin

Cotter converted. Two tries
followed. A m i s s - k i c k by
the B a n k ' s full back enabled
the A ' s to exploit a massive
gap in the' defence and
Chris Cuthbertson to score
e a s i l y . The final blow was
struck by Jon P i t c h e r who
made a good run on the
left to collect a well-timed
pass from Hugh Duncan and
score in the corner.
In the end the score was
33.9. Such was the quality
of the teamwork that a score
even more favourable to the
A ' s would have been an
even more accurate indicator.
It was a real team effort.
