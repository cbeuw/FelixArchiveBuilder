Everthing you always wanted to know about the FEES INCREASE
B r i t a i n has recognised her moral r e s p o n s i b i l i t y and has pledged h e r s e l f to help the
developing c o u n t r i e s , from where approximately three-quarters of the overseas students
come. We understand t h i a to mean a i d t© the people of these countries to develop t h e i r
economies, not a i d t e s u b s i d i a r i e s »f B r i t i s h companies, or into the "pockets" of the
e x i s t i n g e l i t e s i n these c o u n t r i e s .
These m«ral o b l i g a t i o n s of B r i t a i n must be seen i n proper h i s t o r i c a l and economic
context. B r i t i s h c o l o n i a l r u l e or economic domination, f o r example, i n Greece or L a t i n
America, are i n many cases the cause of the economic underdevelopment of these c o u n t r i e s ,
which i n turn i s r e s p o n s i b l e f o r the lack of educational f a c i l i t i e s . On the other hand,
the c o l o n i a l e x p l o i t a t i o n of n a t u r a l and human resources has contributed to the
development of the B r i t i s h educational system.
Even today, B r i t a i n continues to have n e o - c o l o n i a l l i n k s with many developing
countries such as Malaysia and many A f r i c a n s t a t e s . B r i t i s h companies operating i n
these countries e x t r a c t , i n the form of p r o f i t s , much more than the £50M a year that i t
t h e o r e t i c a l l y costs to educate overseas students i n B r i t a i n .
CONCLUSION
The d i s c r i m i n a t o r y fees s t r u c t u r e does not provide any s i g n i f i c a n t f i n a n c i a l revenue
to the educational i n s t i t u t i o n s . There i s no j u s t b a s i s f o r any f u r t h e r increase i n
overseas students fees. Such d i s c r i m i n a t o r y p o l i c i e s , as higher fees and immigration
r e s t r i c t i o n s , must be seen i n t h e i r proper context.
A campaign to a b o l i s h d i s c r i m i n a t o r y fees and to oppose f u r t h e r fees increases must
be launched i n a l l c o l l e g e s and u n i v e r s i t i e s . B r i t i s h students must take an important
part i n t h i s campaign-the fees increases are j u s t part of the Educational Cuts p o l i c y
and the decreasing l i v i n g standards f o r a l l students. I f the Government succeeds i n
i s o l a t i n g one s e c t i o n of the student body, i t w i l l have weakened the whole student
movement.
stop fees increase!
only YOU can do it!
