ICCS SAW in the C h i n e s e
New Year last week with
a social gathering which
went off well despite the
late t e a and a film entitled
" L o n g Way From H o m e " -
a film about the different
life styles of a group of
Chinese students going to
America to study. T h e
s u c c e s s of the evening w a s
evidenced by the enjoyment
of a l l who attended.
In the next few w e e k s , the
intercollegiate games between
the C h i n e s e s o c i e t i e s of the
colleges forming L U C S C S ,
take place. We are competing
in a number of games and
sports. Practice for these
forthcoming games is being
provided in the form of a
competition within ICCS —
an I n t e r - y e a r Games
competition. If you are
reasonably good at playing
various games, including
table tennis, c h e s s , squash
etc, or are just out for some
fun, then please contact the
Sports Secretary — we need
players for the inter-collegiate
games.
In addition to the above,
ICCS has arranged a day
trip to Bath at a cost of £2
per person. Those interested
in this outing should contact
ICCS a s soon a s p o s s i b l e .
Last but by no means least
is A n g l e s , the L U C S C S
bi-annual maqazine. A r t i c l e s ,
stories, opinions and s o on
in both E n g l i s h and C h i n e s e
would be most welcome for
the next issue.
Information and enquiries
on any of the above c a n be
obtained from the Committee
and at our Tuesday lunch
times meetings which are
still being held in E l e c
Eng 606.
