Everything you always wanted to know about the
fees increase
T H E F E E S I N C R E A S E
The Government, en the recommendation of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
P r i n c i p a l s (CVCP), has proposed a 30% increase i n the fees f o r next year. This i s an
of £30 f o r "Home Students" and £100 f o r Overseas Students, b r i n g i n g the Overseas f e e
to £4L6.00 per year. This w i l l mean inceased hardship and lower standards of l i v i n g
for a l l s e l f - s u p p o r t i n g students, mainly those from abroad. The fees increase must be
seen as part of the Government's attack on Higher Education, the Education Cuts p o l i c y .
At the same time, the Home O f f i c e , i n c o n t r a d i c t i o n to the p o l i c y of the M i n i s t r y
for Overseas Development, i s imposing i n c r e a s i n g l y s t r i c t r e g u l a t i o n s f o r the renewal
or extension of v i s a s t o overseas students, r e f u s i n g , f o r example, v i s a s to students
who were admitted to h o s p i t a l , and therefore were not r e g u l a r l y attending t h e i r courses.
WHY MUST WE O P P O S E T H E F E E S I N C R E A S E ?
The main r a t i o n a l e behind the d i s c r i m i n a t o r y fees s t r u c t u r e and f u r t h e r fees .
increases i s that they are needed to help b o l s t e r up the educational i n s t i t u t i o n s
which are i n a f i n a n c i a l l y d i f f i c u l t p o s i t i o n because of the economic c r i s i s . The lack
of a basis f o r such an argument can be seen from the f a c t that here, at Imperial, the
t o t a l proposed fees increase represent less than 1.2% of the t o t a l College expenditure.
The increase i n overseas students' fees amounts t o 0.56% of t h i s expenditure. That of
s e l f - s u p p o r t i n g students, B r i t i s h and Overseas, i s about 0.4% of the t o t a l expenditure,
an amount smaller than the net d e f i c i t of the r e f e c t o r i e s and bars during the previous
year.
Thus, any increase would have a n e g l i g i b l e e f f e c t on the f i n a n c i a l resources of the
College. On the other hand, such increases would cause great hardship t o overseas
students. Even i f the fees increases could help to support the educational i n s t i t u t i o n s ,
we do not see why overseas students i n p a r t i c u l a r , or f o r that matter, any other group
of students, should pay t o solve the economic c r i s i s . The Government i s spending many
m i l l i o n s of pounds on "defense", t o keep m i l i t a r y bases i n Cyprus, troops i n Oman and
elsewhere. This money could more u s e f u l l y be spent on education, without endangering
the s e c u r i t y of the B r i t i s h people.
The presence of overseas students i n B r i t a i n brings many m a t e r i a l to i t . F i r s t of
a l l , overseas students b r i n g at least £1,200 each every year to cover t u i t i o n fees and
l i v i n g expenses. There are altogether 96,000 overseas students who, together, b r i n g
£115 millions in foreign currency into Britain.
A very large number of overseas students, e s p e c i a l l y i n places l i k e Imperial College,
are doing research which i s of great value to B r i t i s h i n d u s t r y , (and o f t e n of very
l i t t l e value t o t h e i r own c o u n t r i e s ) . There are 15,151 overseas students doing post-
graduate studies i n B r i t a i n , of which, 675 are a t Imperial College.
Overseas student nurses c o n t r i b u t e a great deal to the N a t i o n a l Health S e r v i c e .
There are 19,877 overseas student nurses working i n B r i t i s h h o s p i t a l s . A l s o , overseas
students provide 4,502 language a s s i s t a n t s i n u n i v e r s i t i e s and schools.
We see that overseas students o f f e r many d i r e c t and i n d i r e c t b e n e f i t s to B r i t a i n , i n
r e t u r n f o r t h e i r education a t "non-economic" f e e s . I f we now look a t some of the
reasons which make overseas students come t o B r i t a i n f o r t h e i r s t u d i e s , we w i l l see
that i n most cases, B r i t a i n has a duty to educate these people.
