Theatre Don't make me laugh
Comedians by Trevor Griffiths
at Wyndham's Theatre
" L A U G H T E R IS the synchronised
co-ordination of neuro-physiological
reflexes, with a semi-automatic impulse
of mass inherited s u g g e s t i o n i s m " .
Who said that? Freud? Goebbels?
Jung?. N o , none of these, but George
Robey, probably better known for being
the cause of laughter than the analyst
of its c a u s e s .
I am indebted to the programme of
Comedians for drawing my attention
to that quotation, for it really underlines
what Trevor Griffiths is about in this
play. If you want to earn your living by
making people laugh, it is not enough
just to think up a few jokes and then
tell them w e l l . Y o u ' v e got to understand
what it is that you can give your
audience, that will e l i c i t the right
reactions.
Last w e e k ' s Listener contained an
article on John C l e e s e , by Wilfred
D e ' A t h , in which it is revealed that
when they were writing Fawlty Towers,
Mr C l e e s e and his wife d i s c u s s e d " . . .
B a s i l Fawlty in terms of transactional
a n a l y s i s : as to whether, at certain
times, B a s i l was behaving as a parent
or as a c h i l d " . It is pretty clear that
even if you cannot spot the winners
every time, you can make a pretty
informed judgement as to which routines
wi 1
1 succeed.
Mr Griffiths sets his theories into a
neat framework around the debuts of
six would-be stand-up c o m i c s . They
have already spent months perfecting
their acts under the tutelage of an
established comic, played by Jimmy
J e w e l . The audience in the theatre is
cleverly used as the membership of the.
Manchester working men's club where
the acts are tried out. It is hard to
gauge how the northern audience would
take to the acts s i n c e their reactions
must be, in some ways, different from
those produced in the west end. The
talent scout has the hard job of handing
out contracts to acts which may have got
a better reaction in Manchester than
they did in London.
Stephen R e a stands head and shoulders
above the rest, both in his own performance
and in that of George M c B r a i n , the
docker from B e l f a s t . It was interesting
to note that two of the best received
gags came from outside the comic
team; the school caretaker with the
results of the karate c l a s s , and the
illiterate Indian looking for the 'Reading
to Learn' c l a s s as a solution to his
problem.

Comedians is a Nottingham
Playhouse production, and was seen
in the National Theatre repertoire
at the O l d V i c . It has come to my
notice that the cheapest seats,
bookable in advance, at the new
National Theatre w i l l be £2.35. At
the Old V i c it is possible to book
seats for as little as 40p. I don't
suppose many students w i l l be able
to queue on the day of the performance
for the £1.00 and 50p seats. A n y
comments?
OPSOC: A sparkling performance
U T O P I A L I M I T E D
or The Flowers of Progress
by W.S. Gilbert and A . S . Sullivan.
F I R S T P E R F O R M E D in 1893 (when it
ran for 245 performances), Utopia
Limited has only been, performed very
rarely s i n c e then and in this delightful
production, staged by the IC Operatic
Society, we see some of the reasons
for this. The opera is fairly topical
and poses technical difficulties in its
production, requiring no fewer than
18 s o l o i s t s - a rather large number for
an opera.
Despite this and many other d i f f i c u l t i e s ,
and the obvious drawback of a small
stage O P S O C have succeeded where
many others might have f a i l e d .
The opera i s brought a l i v e by a
cleverly designed stage (Dramsoc
rule ok!
and some very imaginative
and s i n k i n g costumes. The props
aside, however, deserved praise must
go to the cast for a well executed
and sparkling performance.
Special m e n t i o n must go to
D E B O R A H K E M P (Lady Sophy) whose
beautiful singing was only matched by
the comical facial expressions of
J O H N B A R R A T T (King Paramount I),
both of whom were excellent in their
roles. R O G E R WOODWARD (Scaphio)
and R O G E R N I C H O L S (Phantis), as
the two tyrannical w i s e men keeping a
watchful eye over the K.ing, constantly
delighted the audience with their
'routines'. S T E V E C H A Y T O W (Lord
Dramaleigh, a British Lord Chamberlain)
and D E L I T H B R O O K ( P r i n c e s s Zara)
a d d e d idiosyncracies and c h a r m
respectively to the proceedings. Ms
Brook and Mr Barratt sing very well
in this first night performance considering
that both had only just recovered from
t o n s i l l i t i s .
The opera is a biting satire of the
E n g l i s h way of life and its institutions.
T h i s is highlighted on two o c c a s i o n s .
F i r s t , when the two younger princesses
mime on Lady Sophy's song on " h o w
a naice young English lady should
conduct h e r s e l f " , that is, how to turn
one's nose up at an unsuitable suitor.
" Y o u n g ladies always t o s s " (to
settle who gets the man), she c o n c l u d e s .
The second is a burlesque of the
Downing Street proceedure as it is
presented " i n accordance with the
practice of St J a m e ' s H a l l " .
The music is liberally strewn with
popular(?) pieces such as " R u l e ,
B r i t t a n i a " and " t h e National A n t h e m "
which taken together with acting,
result in very funny s c e n e s . The
overture used here is one s p e c i a l l y
composed by Max Taylor - S u l l i v a n ' s
original has not survived.
The orchestra, ably conducted by
D A V I D C R E E D , played well and
found time to laugh at the gags inbetween
playing. A l l in a l l , a very enjoyable
production from O P S O C .
