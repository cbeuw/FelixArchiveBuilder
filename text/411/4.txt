Legal aid:
where to get it
H O P E F U L L Y , we shall soon
be getting someone to come
and give legal advice on a
regular b a s i s at the Welfare
Centre. Meanwhile, here is
how to go about getting
help.
The Union has a s o l i c i t o r
who will give advice over
the 'phone. If you wish to
speak to him, come to the
Welfare Centre or the Union
Office. M a n y C i t i z e n s
A d v i c e Bureaux will have a
"solicitor in attendance or can
refer you to one. A d d r e s s e s
of local Bureaux are a v a i l a b l e
from the Welfare Centre.
Recently neighbourhood
law centres have been
springing up. The first
opened in 1970 in North
Kensington. These will give
free advice to anyone within
their catchment area and
w i l l help you if you need to
go to court or a tribunal. Their
object is to make lawyers
more a c c e s s i b l e to people
and to make people aware of
their legal rights. There are
13 of these centres in
London and their addresses
are available from the
Welfare Centre.
Financial eligibility
If you visit a private
solicitor who is in the legal
help either free or at a
reduced rate. T h i s help
covers everything, including
other experts' fees, short
of actual court proceedings.
Extensions of the £25 limj.t
are p o s s i b l e in s p e c i a l
circumstances. The solicitor
c a l c u l a t e s your financial
e l i g i b i l i t y and f i l l s in the
details on the 'green form'
which you s i g n .
The calculation is based
on your weekly ' d i s p o s a b l e
income' and 'disposable
c a p i t a l ' . The former is your
gross income less a l l o w a n c e s
such as rent. The latter is
your gross capital- l e s s
allowancesfor debts. Husbands
and w i v e s finances are
combined unless the dispute
is between them. Any article
under dispute is not included
in your c a p i t a l . Your
'disposable c a p i t a l ' must be
less than £250 (plus extras
for d e p e n d a n t s ) . Your
disposable income must be
l e s s than £15 to get the
advice free. Between £15
and £29 you pay a contribution
to the cost.
NUS legal aid fund
If your problem arose out
of any Union sponsored
activity (eg demonstrations)
the N U S legal aid fund may
help although you must have
been refused State legal
aid first.
Leaflets explaining all
this fully are a v a i l a b l e from
the Welfare Centre which is
open Monday to Friday from
12.30 to 1.30pm.
Next week I will d i s c u s s

Welfare Officer
Y O U M A Y remember that some
time ago four representatives
of the National Union of
Students went on a trip to
Bucharest to sign a 17 page
communique on " t h e State of
the W o r l d " . You may also
know that a motion submitted
by IC Union at the U n i v e r s i t i e s
Conference at Durham in
January instructed the N U S
to produce and distribute
copies of this document
immediately. We are now told
that it w i l l not be available
until 20th February. You
might like to know that the
four return fares to Bucharest
cost £930.40. It is rumoured
that a motion is being
submitted to the next N U S
Conference by a number of
c o l l e g e s along the lines;
"This Union deplores the
action of members of the
Executive in signing a
document in Bucharest which
plainly adopts a Moscow
view of world affairs".
On the subject of motions,
I have received two from
Manchester University Union
which I would like to d i s c u s s
at the next Union meeting;
Sir, - With reference to last
w e e k ' s " P e t e r P a t t e r " , Mr
Teague asked for some
suggestions concerning the
College refectories.
It seems to us, that the
first two suggestions, v i z ,
that all students, or just
members of Southside H a l l s
of Residence should pay
some form of " k i t c h e n f e e " ,
in order to cover fixed
c o s t s , is based on unsound
reasoning.
In our experience this
year, it is a fact that a
significant number of students
in T i z a r d H a l l either cook
their own meals or e l s e eat
outside the College refectories,
for instance at one of the
Hotpots, because they get
more enjoyable food and'or
better value for money. It
is interesting to note that
these people go to considerable
trouble to avoid a 'Mooney',
and it is unlik«ly that they
would use the refectories
even if they had to pay
the " k i t c h e n f e e " .
Surely, it is unfair to
expect these people to
s u b s i d i z e those who would
still use the refectories.
One can only assume that
this will take us along a
path, g i v e n a further
deterioration in quality and
hence numbers of people
eating in the refectories,
that would lead to fully-
staffed, but empty refectories.
Those who would answer
us with the suggestion, that
by charging this fee, students
in Southside would be
these are respectively on
Sport, that i s , the inadequacy
of present f a c i l i t i e s and the
inequalities between differ -
ent sectors of Education;
and on disabled students. I
hope that IC Union will
prioritise both these subjects
for d i s c u s s i o n at the next
NUS conference.
Teacher Education
A s many of you will know,
the Department of Education
and Science intends to
reduce teacher training places
in order to lower the proposed
1981 target from 510,000
to 480,000. At least 22
c o l l e g e s are combining to
form nine or ten composite
institutions: another 17
are merging with c o l l e g e s of
further education, and many
places w i l l disappear in the
process of these mergers.
A l s o , at least 13 c o l l e g e s
w i l l c l o s e and about four
c o l l e g e s w i l l be absorbed by
U n i v e r s i t i e s , for example,
at Loughborough.
In the West London area,
several mergers are to take
place this year; Borough
obliged to use the refectories
in order not to waste the
fee, would find that they
had not increased the number
of meals served, but instead,
created a great deal of
i l l - w i l l .
Though one sympathises
with the problems faced by
the catering staff in the
present situation, nobody
g a i n s by maintaining
artificially, a level of
service that is not required
although we realise that
the design of the refectories
is such that economies not
involving redundancies are
difficult if not impossible.
However, the last of
Mr Teague's suggestions
may turn out the most
r e a l i s t i c alternative. It is
possible that by c l o s i n g the
refectories over the weekend
and in the evenings, and
operating a smaller service
in Southside. or if that is
not possible, in the Union,
then the fixed costs may be
reduced hence making the
fee unnecessary.
It is unfortunate that what
appears to be the most
reasonable suggestion was
given so little explanation
in " P e t e r P a t t e r " , perhaps
it has already been ruled
out!
It seems that once again,
the authorities are trying to
take the easy wav out. and
are going to make the students
pay more money that they
can ill afford, rather than
makinq the system more
efficient.
Road C o l l e g e are to merge
with Maria Grey, and Thomas
Huxley C o l l e g e will join
E a l i n g T e c h n i c a l C o l l e g e .
More seriously, Maria Assumpta
C o l l e g e is to c l o s e , having
taken its last intake this
year.
N U S are c a l l i n g a national
day of action for today,
Friday 13th February. There
is to be a distribution of
leaflets in Kensington High
Street this afternoon and the
Institute of Education are
trying to arrange for a float,
that is, a lorry on which
someone w i l l stand and wave
banners. There will then be
a meeting at 3.30 at Maria
Assumpta which will be
addressed by speakers
from various bodies such as
the National Union of
Teachers. N U S are sending
our friend Ms Sue Slipman so
please come along and ask
her some embarassing
questions. D e t a i l s about the
" p r a n c e " in Kensington
High Street should be available
from me in the Union Office.
Hope to see vou at the
meeting. Derrick Everett
We are adamant in our
rejection of the suggestion
of a " k i t c h e n f e e " - instead,
we propose that every
effort be made to reduce
these c o s t s , rather than
inflict this burden upon the
student.
Yours sincerely,

More on
NUS
Sir, - Never have I seen
such concentrated irrelevance
as contained in Mr Brownes'
letter which appeared in
F E L I X on February 6th.
To claim that a national
student strike would have
any more affect than a 'oral
one must be tota balderdash.
Whereas miners can nam, trie
whole country by striking,
students can only harm their
own careers. Perhaps students
at IC are either too apathetic
or aiming to get degrees,
to rally to a call for a
national strike in any c a s e .
In a i l . only one sentiment
was expressed with which I
could in any way agree
with: Stay in the N U S .
Yours, faithfully,
