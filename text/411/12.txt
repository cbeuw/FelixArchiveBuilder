union
T H E N U S revealed this
week, that despite the recent
disaffiliation of s o m e
U n i v e r s i t i e s , their membership
has risen by a quarter of a
m i l l i o n since 1971.
T h i s i n c r e a s e , • at first
sight startling, is mainly
due to two recent d e c i s i o n s .
T h e first i s that . c o l l e g e s
of education have been offered
lower subscription fees to
the National U n i o n since
January 1st. The second i s
that, for the first time,
part-time students are
entitled to use some of
N U S T r a v e l ' s flights, from
which they were previously
excluded by international
charter flight regulations.
In 1971 there were 712
Student U n i o n s belonging to
the N U S , at present there
are 805. It i s hoped to
eventually expand the
membership of the Union to
all full and part-time students
in B r i t a i n , although because
of their richer Student
U n i o n , U n i v e r s i t i e s and
P o l y t e c h n i c s w i l l s t i l l

of N U S ' s income.

to not being representative of
student opinion, would quite
e a s i l y apply to I C U (and
e s p e c i a l l y more so to the
C C U s ) . The major difference
being, of course, that N U S
i s dominated by the Broad
Left while the " B r o a d
R i g h t " rule supreme at I C
T h o s e generating the anti—
Nus hysteria seem to have
turned a completely b l i n d
eye to the l o c a l situation.
E v e n if these a c c u s a t i o n s
were true, the fault for this
state of affairs l i e s with
the apathy — ridden student
both, both l o c a l l y and
nationally. The mechanism
and system for making die
N U S and C O s (constituent
organisations (of NUS)) more
truly representative, already
e x i s t s . The only criterion for
its fulfillment is that students
get off their b a c k s i d e s and
start e x e r c i s i n g their legitimate
franchise.

Profile: Peter Teague
" A first step towards making NUS
more representative would be to
adopt some of the Electoral Reform
Society's suggestions, made in their
new famous letter to Charles C l a r k e " .
" I ' d like N U S to become more
representative. I personally believe
in 'representative d e m o c r a c y ' . " N U S ,
however, i s based on 'active democracy'
— where delegates are elected to
conference — a c t i v i s t s elect a c t i v i s t s ,
who then elect the National E x e c u t i v e ,
who are, therefore, highly activist, and
who obviously do not represent the
majority of students.
' A first step towards making N U S
more representative,," he s a y s , " w o u l d
be to adopt some of the Electoral Reform
S o c i e t y ' s suggestions, made in their
now famous letter to C h a r l e s C l a r k e .
Initially this would mean electing
delegates to N U S Conferences by
secret college-wide ballot, and election
of the V P s of N U S by S T V . T h i s
would at least ensure that the V P s
were representative of the c r o s s -
section of people at conference. T h i s
i s not he s a y s , the case at present.
The next step would be to elect the
four sabbatical officers of N U S by
national ballot.
"Whether it w i l l actually happen or
not is a different matter. The particular
political group in power at the moment,
the Broad Left, obviously doesn't
want to lose that power, so they are
going to resist the change. P e r s o n a l l y ,
I think its time they were put out of
power — they have been there, more
or less, s i n c e 1968, and in those
seven years, their achievements and
trade record have not exactly been
the greatest you could have hoped for.
I think that they nave now become
bankrupt of ideologies, of new campaigns,
of new i s s u e s , and, more than anything
e l ^ p , bankrupt o' new tactics for
s.uoents to use to get what they
want.''
" T h e y (the Broad Left) spend too
much time t r y i n g . t o work out how
they are going to stay in power,
rather than working out where
students should be g o i n g . . . "
He fells that the Broad Left has
become too much a political machine;
"they spend too much time trying to
work out how they are going to stay in
power, rather than working out where
students should be going. The big
argument in their favour is that they
v e very, very dedicated people, and
work very hard."
Within IC, he feels that there is
not enough awareness amongst IC
students of what ICU does for them.
Despite the large number of people
involved in the U n i o n , the U G M s are
still poorly attended, although these
are not the whole of ^e U n i o n . A s
far as Union meetings go, Pete would
like to think that the low turn outs
reflect a satisfaction with the way the
Union is being run.
However, as a academic e x e r c i s e ,
he has often considered measures to
test this — such as putting the Union
'on strike', and suspending all Union
accounts. "I know one of the first
things that would happen — the first
Wednesday afternoon, I would have
about 200 sportsmen knocking on my
door saying "where the bloody hell is
our c o a c h ? " Yet so many people don't
realise these are provided by the
U n i o n . "
If, on the other hand, there was
no uproar, then he would conclude
that people did not care about thr
U n i o n , and that C o l l e g e is wastina
£80,000 on it.
H i s final comments were, "It's
your Union; it is the Students' Union.
Just try and realise what it does for
you, and, more than anything else,
take part in it — whether in a club,
or society, or at the UGM or whatever,
just try and take part. A lot can be done,
but it's the Students themselves, in the
end, who must do it. There's no one
going to help you out. it's up to you."
