A M A N was arrested on
Friday night for the alleged
theft of a handbag, following
a scuffle with police in
the Union Building'.
A t about 11 o ' c l o c k , in
a disco held in the Union
L o w e r Refectory, a girl
noticed a man taking her
friend's handbag. She watched
him carry the b a g out of the
disco and into the men's
toilet. He emerged again,
without the bag and wandered
into the L o w e r Lounge. T h e
girl then told the person on
the door what h a d happened.
He immediately recruited
several w i l l i n g helpers from
the Union B a r , who then
c o l l e c t i v e l y apprehended and
detained the culprit and
three o f h i s friends. T h e
suspect w a s searched and
found to be in p o s s e s s i o n
of an inordinate amount of
small change and a l o t of
note s.
The p o l i c e were then
c a l l e d and half-a-dozen p l a i n
clothes policemen quickly
arrived on the scene. A
scuffle broke out during
questioning o f the suspect
by the police and several
chairs in the Lower Lounge

M R C H R I S K O U R O U N I O T I S ,
opening the General Meeting
of O v e r s e a s Students last
Wednesday, s a i d " t h e
increase i n overseas student
fees i s not just an attack
on overseas student, but
part of the general p o l i c y to
rationalise higher e d u c a t i o n " .
The meeting w a s being held
to d i s c u s s the campaign
against these fee increases
and to adopt tactics for the
campaign.
A l s o present at the meeting
was Mr Trevor P h i l l i p s ,
N U S Vice-president with
responsibility for overseas
students. H e spoke of the
" v i c i o u s press campaign
against a particular section
of the student body, (overseas
s t u d e n t s ) " . There were
five b a s i c l i e s being
propagated, he s a i d , in the
media in an attempt to
divide public and student
opinion about overseas
students.
It w a s not true, for
instance, to imply that a l l
overseas students were rich
as the ' D a i l y E x p r e s s ' h a d
suggested in i t s article on
May Y a h m a n i ' s acceptance to
Oxbridge. Three-quarters of
Trev Phillips
overseas students finance
themselves and only a
further 7% came from wealthy
O P E C countries.
Although many disting-
uished peers and influential
educationalists have spoken
out against the i n c r e a s e i n
overseas students f e e s ,
the Government i s going
ahead with i t s plans to do s o .
A n official p o l i c y group
of the Cabinet which h a s
been looking into the question

were knocked over.
The man w a s identified,
by the girl in B e i t Quad and
was charged at Gerald R d
police station the next
morning.
After the d i s c o , people
were told to check that
their belongings were safe
and it transpired that several
handbags were m i s s i n g . T h e
following d a y , numerous
wallets a n d purses were
discovered i n a cistern in the
men's toilet, although the
handbag seen taken has
not yet been found.
It i s thought that this
incident may be connected
with a series of thefts in
various colleges and the
prompt arrival of the police
would seem to indicate this.
That same evening a handbag
was stolen from B e i t H a l l ,
and articles have been taken
from previous d i s c o s . There
i s bound to be stricter
control o f entry at these
events i n future, as the
thief w a s from outside
Imperial C o l l e g e and only
card-carrying students are
supposed to be admitted.
One of the w a l l e t s
recovered w a s owned by
F E L I X staff member, Ian
Morse. A l l money h a d been
removed from the wallet,
which w a s stolen last term;
but s i x tickets for a " l O c c "
concert next week were
s t i l l in p l a c e , though a
little damp. H e hopes they
w i l l dry out i n time.
