Russell S. Lande, a Royal Society re-
search professor from the Division of
Biology at Imperial, has been awarded
the Weldon Memorial Prize for 2010.
The prize, known as the Weldon Memo-
rial Prize and Medal, is awarded annu-
ally by the University of Oxford and is
named in honor of Walter Frank Raphael
Weldon, a former professor of Zoology
at Oxford.
The prize is defined to be awarded
“without regard to nationality or mem-
bership of any University to the person
who, in the judgement of the electors,
has, in the ten years next preceding the
date of the award, published the most
noteworthy contribution to the devel-
opment of mathematical or statistical
methods applied to problems in Biol-
ogy.” The award is open to biological
fields of study, such as zoology, botany,
anthropology, sociology, psychology,
and medical science.
Delighted to receive the award, Pro-
fessor Lande commented: “I am espe-
cially pleased to be awarded the Weldon
Memorial Prize medal because much
of my research concerns evolution of
quantitative traits (such as body size
and shape) which Weldon also studied.
It is a great honour to join the previous
recipients including Karl Pearson who
pioneered modern statistics motivated to
a large extent by Weldon, and Sir Ron-
ald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall
Wright who founded population genet-
ics and the modern synthetic theory of
evolution.”
“These people have long been my in-
tellectual heroes”, Professor Lande add-
ed. The award, established through the
efforts of Francis Galton and Karl Pear-
son, although intended to be handed out
annually, is often given less frequently.
