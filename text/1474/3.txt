I
’m quite pumped about the
opening of Metric and what
I’m most interested in see-
ing – as a live music fanat-
ic – is the new stage. For
those who dare to recall dB’s, it
was a pretty terrible setup, far
from ideal for playing gigs. We
should now have ourselves a
swag gigging venue, and that’s
great news for everyone from
Jazz n’ Rock, to Music Tech Soc,
to KnitSoc. Hopefully the open-
ing of Metric will usher in a new
era of Imperial home brew activ-
ity with many a live night ahead
of us. There’s also hope that a
more badass venue should at-
tract a higher caliber of touring
artists, and coupled to IC Radio’s
increasingly popular recording
studio we might yet see a few
awesome live records produced
in-house capturing electrifying
stage performances. The possi-
bilities are endless!
For now though we’ll have to
make due with tomorrow’s grand
opening, which in any case is
bound to be massive. Roaming
back and forth between the club
and 568’s impossibly long bar
you should be able to catch a few
decent tunes, with DJ Elles pro-
viding your indie rock fix and Miss
Pink smearing some electro filth
all over the floor. Citadels will be
present, showcasing their tender
synth-pop. Don’t expect moshing
or ruthless self-mutilation, but if
you have a thing for MGMT, The
Flaming Lips and over-the-top
pastiches of 70’s drug-induced
psychadelia, then you might en-
joy this. And they seem like nice
chaps, and may bring a little
happiness into your bleak heart
when you stumble into the room,
drunk as hell, having just been
shot down by that girl you will
have been hitting on all night.
Finalists (but losers) of Sky1’s
answer to X-Factor – ‘Must Be
The Music’ – Missing Andy mix
stadium pop-rock and emo-rap.
It’s like that hip-hop song Keane
did, except all the time. Finally
the femmes fatales of Robots in
Disguise will turn the volume up
with their frantic, shouty brand
of electro-rock, which is perfect
if you thought the fembots from
Austin Powers were hot.
I hope it is a night for all to
remember, whether or not the
music on display is your thing,
and here’s to hoping the Union
does not forget to include perfor-
mances by interesting, cutting-
edge artists. Obviously there
will always be the need to cater
to as wide a taste as possible.
But when you’ve spend gazillions
on a sweet-ass live music venue,
you want to do it justice with
some sweet-ass live music.

Metric finally set to open
NEWS
After almost two months of delays, the new club opens its doors to students
After almost two months of waiting, the
Union’s new club, Metric, is set to open
triumphantly on Saturday 20th Novem-
ber. The launch marks the end of ‘Phase
3’ of the £2.5 million Union redevelop-
ment, which included the refurbishment
of the old Da Vinci’s bar, now FiveSix-
Eight, and a scrub up of the Union Bar.
The refurbishment, which began at the
beginning of the summer, has been be-
set with problems relating to the age of
the building, including the discovery of
asbestos a month ago. In addition the re-
moval of a central pillar in Metric, which
threatened to jeopardise the clubs’ abil-
ity to act as a live music venue, proved
to be a greater construction challenge
than thought. As a Union spokesperson
put it, “the club would have opened for
Welcome Week if it weren’t for the pil-
lar”. The original opening date of the
2nd of October was first moved back to
the 29th, but the discovery of asbestos
meant it was pushed back again to the
20th of November.
The event is almost guaranteed to be a
sell-out. At the time of writing over 400
tickets had been sold in advance and
builders were working well into the night
adding finishing touches to the venue.
However some students have complained
that the cost of entry is too high, citing
the delayed opening as a reason to have
free entrance, “This is actually a joke.
How is this not free considering how
long its taken to open?” said one student
on the Facebook event. The issue was
also brought up during the Union Coun-
cil meeting on Monday 15th November.
However the Union rejected this criti-
cism saying, “bands don’t come for free
regardless of whether there’s asbestos
delays or not”. In addition Union Presi-
dent Alex Kendall told Council that the
Union were spending £6,000 on the event
and even if they sold out, they would still
make a £3,000 loss on ticket sales.
The event has a focus on live music
that will become the hallmark of Union
events for this year and years to come.
The club was redesigned with live music
in mind and so finally the theory, drawn
from student surveys, that Imperial stu-
dents want more live music will be put
to the test.
