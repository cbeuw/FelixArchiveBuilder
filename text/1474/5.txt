Should international
students plug the
funding gap?
Numbers
cant amount of money – but we should
be able to keep that [international tuition
fee] growth under control”.
International students at Imperial cur-
rently pay over 7 times the amount that
home students pay per annum, though
the Higher Education Funding Council
for England (HEFCE) subsidizes some
of the teaching costs for home students.
International tuition fees are set by the
Management Board within College in
the previous year. When deciding upon
how much international students are
charged, a college spokesman stated
that “Imperial takes into consideration
a number of factors, including the fees
set by its national and international com-
petitors, and course demand”.
The average tuition fees faced by in-
ternational students have steadily risen
since 2005 and are set to rise by a further
£430 for next year. The most noticeable
example of an increase in fees is for un-
dergraduate medicine years 1-3, which
has been increased by around a third
since 2005. International tuition fees
must also be paid upfront and on top of
that, bursaries for international students
are few and far between.
When asked whether the current dis-
parity between home fees and interna-
tional fees was fair, the student reac-
tion was mixed, though it was mutually
agreed that the issue of international fees
is controversial.
One student, who wishes to remain
anonymous, believes that he can “see
that high fees for foreigners may dam-
age a prestigious university’s ability to
take on only the very best students”, but
thinks that UK students are more likely
to stay in the UK, which could poten-
tially have positive effects on the UK’s
economy and skilled workers base. On
this basis, he believes “the same ben-
efits will not be seen from foreign stu-
dents, and so perhaps it is justified that
they bear the brunt of university costs”
though added that it “sounds to me as
if more bursaries should be offered for
internationals – this would allow UK
universities to acquire outstanding stu-
dents”.
Another difference for the interna-
tional fee system is that tuition fees are
not frozen for the year of entry, which
means that the fees paid by any interna-
tional students who are currently study-
ing at the university could potentially
be affected by changes in the economic
climate.
The instability of the international fee
system is something that the union finds
worrying. The union president, Alex
Kendall, believes that “the [international
fee] systen needs to be transparent, [in-
ternational] students need to know how
much they pay each year”. The union
will be discussing this issue with the
College in the coming weeks.
The question of how much top univer-
sities can charge before overseas appli-
cants are put off by the fees is a tricky
one. An international student, who wish-
es to remain anonymous, believes that
for more well off international students,
increasing fees would not deter them
from applying to the UK, but added that
“for another part of international stu-
dents, maybe the fees will be too high.
Maybe they will choose to go to other
European universities, like Germany
which has some universities which don’t
charge tuition fees at all”. When asked
whether a rise in tuition fees would have
stopped her from applying to the UK,
she answered that it would not have, but
that if she was offered a bursary else-
where, such as the USA, she would have
opted to go there instead.
On the other hand, raising tuition fees
for home students is also fraught with
complications. Imperial student Re-
becca Clarke, a 3rd year undergraduate
physicist, believes that raising fees for
home students would be “more fair for
all the non EU students” but she had
reservations as to whether raising the
tuition fees for home students would
be fair overall, “because home students
outweigh the numbers of international
students, if not at Imperial then certainly
across the UK”.
Not raising the tuition fee cap will
mean that overseas students may have
to shoulder the burden of the shortfall
in funding raising their already substan-
tial tuition fees. Raising the tuition fee
cap will double or treble the amount of
debt that home students leave university
with.
Any increase in tuition fees for home
students will undoubtedly reduce the fi-
nancial burden faced by their colleagues
from overseas. Nevertheless as the cap
on home tuition fees remains, it is likely
that the fees paid by international stu-
dents will continue to play a dispropor-
tionate role in plugging the hole in the
university’s funding.
