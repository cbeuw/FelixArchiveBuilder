A wave of students descended on
London last week, bringing with
them a whiff of lager and 'herbal'
cigarettes. I was there. The other
march I’ve been on this term for
journalism was a peaceful rally of
scientists. That group achieved
their aims. The other? I doubt it.
The Science is Vital campaign
aimed to protect the science bud-
get before the spending review. It
worked. Universities minister Da-
vid Willetts said the quality of evi-
dence built up convinced the gov-
ernment to protect the science
budget. A rally of 4,000 people
had a great effect.
Last Wednesday, 52,000 stu-
dents marched to protect the
education budget and prevent
higher fees. The "Demolition"
rally was just that. A group of
protesters stormed the Tory HQ,
throwing smoke bombs and light-
ing fires from the roof.
My problem is not the aim of
the protest. I agree that crippling
debt will be a barrier to young
people, but I don’t think attacking
the Tories will work.
Perhaps some lessons can be
learnt from Science is Vital...
1. Argue in terms Conserva-
tives can understand. Science
is Vital put their case in terms
of the money. Tories are simple
creatures, and humouring them
will get you far.
2. Get wittier placards.
Science is Vital: “We want a fair
share of the π”
Demolition: “Osbourne F***
off”
3. Play the Government at their
own game. Try to get a politician
fighting for you. Science is Vital
had former MP Evan Harris lead-
ing their rally, and campaigning
super hard for them. He had good
contact with cabinet ministers
and played a big part in ensuring
the argument reached the right
ears.
4. Don’t route your march past
Tory headquarters. That’s just
asking for trouble.
5. Don’t mention the Nazis.
As soon as someone says ‘It’s
like the Third Reich’, I zone out.
Pictures of David Cameron with
a Hitler moustache have exactly
the same effect. Thinking about
it, I haven’t ever seen the two of
them in the same room together...
Student organizations have expressed
outrage after it was recently revealed
that a group of senior Liberal Democrat
figures planned to surrender their policy
on removing tuition fees in the case of
a possible coalition government – two
months before the general election.
In the document unveiled by The
Guardian and dated 16th March, Danny
Alexander, current Chief Secretary to
the Treasury. suggested that: "we should
seek agreement on part-time students
and leave the rest," pertaining to the
raising of the tuition fee cap.
The news is likely to come as a heavy
blow to Nick Clegg, after he back-
tracked on his signing of the pledge
organized by the National Union of
Students (NUS) to oppose any vote on
raising tuition fees and especially after
he admitted last week that he "should
have been more careful" when making
the promise.
The document was revealed by Con-
servative MP Rob Wilson in his new
book 'Five Days to Power', detailing the
period of coalition negotiations follow-
ing the general election. It was also re-
vealed that Alexander had not believed
that a coalition government with the
Conservative Party would have been
possible, citing that it would be "ex-
tremely difficult to form without split-
ting [the Liberal Democrats]."
The Liberal Democrats have stood by
their decisions, with a spokesman claim-
ing in response that they have fulfilled
the "four key priorities which were set
out on the front page of [their] mani-
festo", distinctly laid out as follows:
'fair taxes that put money back in your
pocket', 'a fair chance for every child',
'a fair future, creating jobs by making
Britain greener' and 'a fair deal for you
from politicians'.
Student organizations are likely to
disagree with the 'fair deal' aspect of
the manifesto, with various anti-Liberal
Democrat protests being organized next
week. The Education Activist Network
calls on its followers to 'target Lib Dems
after [their] new betrayal', planning a
'day of mass walkouts to converge on a
demonstration outside the Lib Dem HQ'.
The NUS has planned a more physically
restrained approach, forming their own
'Right to Recall' pledge for students
to sign promising that they will vote
against any candidate who broke any
pledge on university fees or Education
Maintenance Allowances.
The initiative is named after a proce-
dure suggested by the Liberal Demo-
crats themselves, involving penalizing
MPs who break promises or are found
guilty of impropriety by forcing an im-
mediate by-election.

Democrats’ credibility

A
round 70 students from
the University of Man-
chester and over 170
from the University of
Sussex have staged sit-
ins and occupied university buildings in
order to protest that government’s near
80% cut to teaching budgets.
Students at Manchester university oc-
cupied an ‘admin’ building on the 11th
of November, the day after the N.U.S.
march in London. They demanded that
the university open its finances to the
students, and properly explain: “where
the cuts will fall, how many voluntary
redundancies have already been made
and to highlight the fact that the vice
Chancellor is paid 20 times the average
salary”. They also added “We are here
to support lecturers and administrative
staff who will be losing their jobs. To
oppose the rise in tuition fees that will
price out most working class students.
And to oppose the privatisation of our
Universities.”
At Sussex university, students oc-
Manchester and
Sussex students stage
sit-ins to protest cuts
to higher education
cupied a lecture theatre and put on a
number of events including talks by the
Anarchist Society, the Student Worker
Student Society and an event entitled
“Boycott Israeli Goods”. The students
decried the rise in tuition fees, coupled
with the cuts in government funding
saying “This marketization of educa-
tion will destroy the prospect of free and
critical academic enquiry, on which uni-
versities should be based”
The sit-in at Manchester university
ended relatively quickly. After 3 hours
of occupation they left to “better orga-
nize the next steps of the campaign”.
University of Manchester Vice Chan-
cellor Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell
sent this message to the protestors, “As
an institution embracing academic free-
dom, we welcome the expression by stu-
dents of strongly held views, and accept
the right of those advocating such views
to assert them,” and added that “The
University will clearly need to adapt to
future financial challenges – but we will
do so in a way that fulfils our key com-
mitment to delivering an outstanding
student experience.”
The Sussex university sit-in lasted for
at least two days but is unclear exactly
how it ended.
