Dear Flying Lotus: There is no need to stare daggers at Chiddy
Bang... You are far better
I had previously seen FlyLo at
Bestival this past summer. Forget
festival nostalgia, his gig at Koko
simply wasn’t as freaky as his set
as Bestival and there’s one simple
reason: space to breathe.
I stood at the back of the crowd
down on the ground floor of Koko
and impatiently waited for the
support act to end – they weren’t
very good, aiming for the ‘turn up
the whomp’ style of dubstep that
we all know and ‘love’. I was el-
bowed from the right. Then shuf-
fled into from the left. Inevitably
someone taller than me (I’m 6ft
3”!) with an over-sized rucksack
came and stood in front of me. Oh
joy.
Flying Lotus sauntered on stage,
oozing charisma and beaming his
trademark ‘high-as-a-kite’ smile.
He chatted with the crowd for a
The prospect of attending an in-
timate gig with an American hip-
hop legend was hugely exciting
for me, and as a pretty unknown
act here in the UK I had no clue
what kind of audience would be
turning out, and what the response
would be. After supporting Tinie
Tempah on a national tour, this
was Chiddy Bang’s one and only
headlining gig in the UK before
heading back to the States.
Supporting Chiddy were group
modern rock group Awol Nation,
and Dizzee-soundalike ‘Smurfie
Syco’. Awol weren’t my type of
music, but definitely exceeded
my expectations for a rock group.
They mixed a classic rock sound
and modern quirky electro to pro-
duce something new and relevant;
it will be interesting to see how
much more we see of them in the

Tru Thoughts
2010
This is another sublime collection of some of the
best music around at the moment, from dub to
dance, and psychedelic jazz to trip hop and compiled
by one of the UK’s best independent labels - Tru
Thoughts. Feel good grooves mix with rich soulful
vocals on tracks like Alice Russel’s ‘Hurry on Now’
remix, while sharp horns with swaggering guitars
are laid out all over ‘Dr Who’ by Smerins Anti-Social
Club. What I like most about this record is that it
takes absolutely no effort to enjoy at all, from the in-
stant the CD is in the deck you can’t help but feel im-
mediately chilled and encapsulated by the pulsating
grooves. It is so well conceived and executed as a
compilation album that it should make for essential
listening, even for someone with limited knowledge
of the genres it covers.

Beach House & Lower Dens
Shepherds Bush Empire
23rd November
7:00pm
Beach house are quickly rising through indie’s
ranks, and its easy to see why, with their enchanting
simple melodies and dreamy lo-fi sound. Their latest
album released at the beginning of the year ‘Teen
Dream’ showed signs of a band truly refining their
sound and Victoria Legrad’s husky voice was shown
to be more effective than ever. Support comes from
another Baltimore band, Lower Dens, who are very
much in the same vein as Beach House and have
the potential to follow in their footsteps. Taking
to the stage in the Shepherds Bush Empire this
Tuesday, Beach House are sure to send you into a
shoegazing daydream!

C
anada has given us a
choice, if scant, of alterna-
tive music in the last de-
cade, with NME darlings,
Arcade Fire and Crystal
Castles both achieving critical acclaim
with recent releases, although the chanc-
es are you’ve probably not heard of On-
tario’s Tokyo Police Club.
Announcing themselves on Heaven’s
dizzyingly tall stage with a huge burble
of bass, the quartet break into their vi-
rally catchy opener ‘Favourite Colour’
whose chorus is unsurprisingly chanted
by nearly everyone in the room. Given
such a long set, fan favourites from ear-
ly EPs are given a well received airing
early on, as is a good chunk of the debut
LP, ‘Elephant Shell’. All but two songs
from ‘Champ’ also make an appearance
(one unusual absentee being the brilliant
upcoming single ‘Gone’). New material
is eaten up by the crowd, from the jittery
Synthesisers of ‘Bambi’, to the anthemic
‘Boots of Danger’, whose hook is sung
long after they actually stop playing.

edge of stage and demands the house

Gollings were whipped up into
a frenzy under the arches
lights go up in order for him to survey
the throng below, and by all accounts he
likes what he sees. He still has the air of
a teenager playing his first ever gig; his
giddy excitement is palpable and com-
pletely infectious, and that’s a large part
of what makes this group so endearing.
They’re a throwback to childhood and
more innocent times; lyrical references
to grade school, favourite foods and co-
lours, Rubix’s cubes and even Disney
films, for some reason, just work. And
more than that, by the time they break
out old singles ‘In a Cave’ and ‘Tessel-
late’ they have a whole venue whipped
up into absolute frenzy.
This is all before Graham Wright’s
synthesiser sings out the opening chords
of their last and easily most famous song,
‘Your English Is Good’, which sends the
front half of the crowd (including yours
truly) into utter hysteria. But of course
there’s being confident, and then there’s
encoring with a Weezer cover. Happily,
their rendition of ‘My Name Is Jonas’ is
perfectly executed; far from the garage-
rock sacrilege an inferior band would
have surely committed.

UK. Smurfie seemed to please the
masses with his take on hip-hop,
but it was most certainly a Tinchy
Stryder, Dizzee Rascal copycat,
and didn’t have much to offer ex-
cept from melodic samples and a
good DJ.
Chiddy Bang are a duo from
Philadelphia, yet to release an al-
bum, so focusing on promoting
their EP, ‘Chiddy Bang: The Pre-
view’. Their first single ‘Opposite
of Adults’ was a worldwide smash,
and largely due to the MGMT
sample, landed themselves a spot
in the music industry. Chiddy were
definitely born to perform live,
and they seemed hugely comfort-
able with a crowd and their music.
Chidera is most definitely the best
freestyler I have ever heard, his
on-the-spot vocals both technically
challenging, and hugely entertain-
ing. With a few catchy tunes, and
a few hard hip-hop beats, Chiddy
Bang showed they definitely have
a place in the UK market, and
they’re most certainly a group to
look out for in 2011.

Chiddy Bang has the power of morphing into his stage name
Alien abduction of frontman Dave Monks follows
moment (a welcome relief from
all these shy, awkward folk/indie
bands) and then let his music do
the talking. I cheered and then tried
and failed to let my dancing do the
talking. My thoughts were over-
whelmed by the fuckwits next to
me: bump, stamp, ow that’s a high
heel on my foot, ow… fuck this.
I went to dance with my friends
in the space in front of the down-
stairs bar. There was space but we
looked weird and the sound was
shit. All seemed lost until we dis-
covered the secret bar in Koko. I
won’t reveal where it is (otherwise
you’ll come and crowd me out)
but, safe to say, I was finally able
to enjoy FlyLo’s groovy beats.
His remix of ‘Idioteque’ was even
more haunting than Radiohead’s
original and let’s be honest, there’s
no better way to end the night than
with “Do The Astral Plane”.
In conclusion, Koko was shit but
Flying Lotus was sick as usual;
I just wish it hadn’t taken me the
first half of his set to find some-
where decent to dance.
