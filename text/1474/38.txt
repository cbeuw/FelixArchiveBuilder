Friday 19 November 2010
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
See thing is Cleggman. Ur a bit
uptight about things. Do every-
thing by the book
1) Walk slowly to your seat with an air
of arrogance. Perhaps drop your finan-
cial times in the isle and announce to
nearby students that you dropped your
financial times in the isle.
2) Assume that everything you say is
funny
3) Turn your phone on loud when the
lecturer tells you to put them on silent
because you want everyone to hear your
hilarious ringtone. Probably that fucking
‘bird is the word’song from Family Guy
4) Bring your whole filing cabinet to
the lecture in your leather brief case and
spread all your folders out across the
desk, disregarding any workspace the
people next to you might need for their
pathetic single refill pad
5) Use a colour-code system for high-
lighting your notes.
6) Laugh at any text you receive because
it makes it look like you have funny
friends. Then text back with a smirk on
your face as if to say ‘I’m now writing
a funny text back to my funny friends’.
7) Tell your neighbours about a hilari-
ous incident involving the isle and your
financial times
8) Ask the lecturer to wait for you to
catch up because you were too busy
colour-coding your notes
9) Ask the lecturer some stupidly irrel-
evant question with long words that you
found on Wikipedia
10) Remind your neighbours that you’re
hung over because you were drinking
alcohol the night before
11) When the lecturer asks a ques-
tion, shout out a really funny answer.
PLEASE REFER TO TIP NO. 2
12) When the lecturer makes a state-
ment, try to find some weak contradic-
tory paradox.
E.g. ‘At present, it is necessary to de-
stroy an embryo to obtain embryonic
stem cells’
‘But Professor, if it is necessary to
destroy an embryo to obtain embryonic
stem cells, it is surely also necessary to
destroy the embryonic stem cells in or-
der to completely destroy the embryo.’
13) Tell the lecturer that he ended a sen-
tence with a preposition
14) You don’t understand something.
Assume that the lecturer has made a
mistake somewhere
15) Remind the lecturer that there should
be a problem sheet for this lesson
16) Wear a suit to lectures. (Dammit!
I’ve done this. Ed)
17) Wear clothes that ‘compliment your
personality’
18) Wear a hoodie with a big bold and
inventive nick name printed on the back,
like ‘THE JOKER’, so that people know
you are an established member of a club
with a high-ranking social status that
merits such a banterous moniker
19) Invent the word ‘banterous’
20) Turn every sentence into a ‘ur mum’
joke because everything sounds like an
innuendo to you. ‘Ur mum sounds like
an innuendo to you’
21) Write loudly with your scratchy pens
22) Talk with a French accent
23) Over-gesticulate
24) Save your empty adjacent seat for
your trampy hippy friend. I didn’t want
to sit next to you anyway. You have a
distorted face and milky breath...fucking
whore.
25) Complain to Felix about the unnec-
essary use of the word ‘asshole’ at the
beginning of this article

Twitter
Hangman is on Twitter. @hang-
man_felix. We’ve decided to
open our arms to the soulless
embrace of the webosphere.
Although judging by what hap-
pened to the last guy, maybe
it’s not such a good idea...
