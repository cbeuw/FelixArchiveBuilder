Proposals to increase the tuition fee cap
to £9000 per year for EU and home stu-
dents were attacked by over 50,000 stu-
dents protesting on the streets of London
last week. However, the opinions of one
particular group of students who also
have a stake in this matter have mostly
been ignored. Felix explores the effect
that raising the tuition fee cap will have
on international students.
The leading UK universities have a
reputation for world-class research and
teaching, which attract many overseas
applicants. As a consequence, the num-

student population, and the money gen-

despite only making up 26% of under-
graduate numbers.

the tuition fee cap will plug the gap
left by the abolition of the teaching
budget, it still leaves many universities
underfunded, so international students
may yet face a increase in tuition fees.
Speaking at Peking University on the
10th of November, Prime Minister Da-
vid Cameron said that raising the tuition
fee cap for home students will mean that
