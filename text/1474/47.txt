Wolverines progress well
in South Coast Open
On the weekend just gone, our 1st and
2nd team entered the South Coast Open
Dodgeball tournament in Southampton
with both teams (Imperial Wolverines
I and II) reaching the quarter-finals and
producing an all round solid result. The
tournament report follows:
On Sunday 7th November we had
9 keen dodgeballers meet early in the
morning in Waterloo station. We’d
found out that 3 of the guys from the
second team had dropped out for vari-
ous reasons so it was not a great start to
the day!
We managed to get our tickets to Shol-
ing train station and boarded the train,
although Ben “I’ll happily miss the train
for a BK bacon double cheeseburger”
Bell managed to cut it so fine that even
Adam “I never panic. I’m the president.”
Cutmore went a little pale.
After a couple of train changes and
a “short” walk from the station to the
leisure centre, we finally arrived. We
were running a little late as Impe-
rial were playing the first game of the
tournament. After getting changed and
quickly warming up, it was straight into
the action!
The way tournament matches work is
that you have five 2 minutes games and
the team to have won the most out of
that 5, wins the match.
The 1sts had their opening match
against the best team in their group, the
Derby Seahawks 1sts. After the first two
games, we were level at 1-1. This was
due to some brilliant throwing by Steve
“I’m not too bad at running” Ndumbe
and about 37 catches by Alan “Careful,
or I’ll drop you” Soltani. After this, they
Adam Cutmore changed their tactics and, catching us off
guard, went on to win 4-1.
Fortunately, Imperial I then went on
to win their next two matches 5-0 (So-
ton Dodgettes) and 3-2 (Portsmouth
B) with brilliant team play all round.
(We’re not going to mention that one of
those matches was against Southampton
women’s team... Ben Bell summed it
up: “Either they’re all gonna be abso-
lute dykes or amazing at Dodgeball. Or
both!”).
Unfortunately, they were neither.
Hence, the first team qualified second in
their group and went on through to the
quarters.
During all this, dark horses Imperial
II, plus some borrowed players from
the Derby 3rds, were steaming through
their group as well. With Tom “I refuse
to catch anything” Lowndes captaining
the team, Dan “Suicide” Price getting
someone out with virtually every throw
and Scott “I’m a goalie, therefore I can
catch” Edwards catching, they managed
to win matches against the Soton Pirates
2nds and Winchester Reloaded, at times
with only 4/6 players on the team! Their
third match was against the reigning na-
tional champions, Jammy Dodgers, who
happen to have two England players in
their team. Despite some of our 1st team
stepping in to help out, we were demol-
ished as expected.
Still, the 2nds had qualified for the
quarters as well and everyone was in
great spirits!
The II’s had their quarter final first.
They were up against the Southamp-
ton 1sts, whom were obviously in their
home ground. We borrowed players
from Derby 3rds but could not over-
come their experience and strength. We
took solace in the fact that the Soton 1sts
went on to be runners up of the whole
tournament. The II’s had fought a good
fight.
The I’s had their quarter final against
Minotaur Dodgeball. Their captain “the
world hates me, so I’m gonna moan
about every decision, even after I’ve
won the game” was their only decent
player and we were looking for a result.
With some blistering throws from Ru-
pert “These ****** balls are so ******
****”.
Some brilliant catches from Adam
“Throw together, Dodge alone” Cut-
more saw us go 2-0 up. Unfortunately,
a change in mentality from the Mino-
taurs led to them edging the next two
games.
This left for a very tense final game.
In the last 10 seconds both teams were
down to two players each and the Mi-
notaurs had all 3 balls. They threw one.
Adam went for a heroic catch to wrap it
up...and dropped.
Everyone was gutted and felt very
hard done by. We had definitely been
the better team and received nothing
but praise from the Derby 1sts who
would have been our semi-final oppo-
nents.
At the end of the day it was a great
performance by all involved and we
are looking forward to the University
Championships at Warwick University
on November 28th and a friendly against
Royal Holloway University pencilled in
for November 24th.
And never, ever forget the words
which will be forever imortalised
by the legend of dodgeball, Patch-
es O’Houlihan; ‘If you can dodge a
wrench...’
