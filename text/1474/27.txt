A playlist from
brilliant British
songwriters...
Some of the greatest songs to
have graced my ears, that influ-
ence many of the song-writers to-
day, including myself, came from
our little kingdom
Before hearing his seventh studio al-
bum, I associated Badly Drawn Boy
with mediocrity; having listened to it,
nothing has changed. The tracks range
from dull, generic folk-pop, to cheap
copies of other, better artists, ‘I Saw
You Walk Away’, could be a Morrissey
filler track. Aside from the obligatory
acoustic guitar, the instrumentation is
truly bizarre, including repeated use of
a drum machine that adds nothing. Lyri-
cally this is crammed full of clichés and
vague, meaningless phrases. This album
is only the first in a series of three, I
hope for his sake that the next two are a
lot better. Stephen Smith

A
s an Imperial student,
the Royal Albert Hall
can easily become a
mundane and constant
feature of our university
lives. It’s by no means an ugly building
but, after almost three and half years
at Imperial, I scarcely give it a cursory
glance. Last Sunday, after experienc-
ing The Cinematic Orchestra perform
within its circled walls, I found a re-
newed appreciation for our illustrious
neighbour.
The Cinematic Orchestra last per-
formed at the Royal Albert Hall in 2007
and the night had the air of a triumphant
return (an extremely cold triumphant re-
turn but triumphant nonetheless). They
were as impressive as I expected, but
before they took to the stage, we had a
couple of delicious appetizers.
The London Metropolitan Orches-
tra opened and, from my seat in Choir
behind the stage, for the first time I un-
derstood the complexity and skill of the
orchestra and the conductor. Strangely
enough, I think because I was there of
my accord (instead of being coerced
by my keen-to-be-cultured parents) I
was more open-minded about the clas-
sical music and more able to enjoy it.
Although trying to explain to the stew-
ard, as I waited to return to my seat after
using the bathroom, that there were two
separate ‘orchestras’ performing that
night but only one was an actual orches-

The side-project of Placebo drummer
Steve Hewitt, this single is heavily led
by the distorted, bassy misery-rock of
his day-job band, although it’s much
more direct and a significantly less fey
affair than you’d expect from Molko
et al. The effects are straight out of
the 80’s synth-rock box, which may
or may not be your cup of tea, but the
track suffers as it can’t decide what it
wants to be. It veers between aiming
for a claustrophobic, uncomfortable
Deftones-esque sound and an indie club
jump-along rock track and as a result,
does neither quite convincingly.

This week’s prize for the worst abuses
of auto-tune go to Skandal, who appar-
ently hasn’t learned the lessons of Li’l
Wayne’s recent crap rock album – and
subsequent jail term. Still, the South
London rapper has an ear for a beat, and
with the addition of a singer that didn’t
sound like a voice-mail message record-
ed in a bucket, there’d be a decent tune
here. He can rap, even if his rhymes
are a little suspect every now and again:
I’ve never heard an enemy described as
being “like a bendy bus” before, but I
suppose you’ve got to work with what
you’ve got.

Another hazy dream pop band from Bal-
timore that are well worth your attention
are Lower Dens, playing with fellow
Baltimoreans Beach House this week.
Their debut record released on singer-
songwriter and visual artist; Devendra
Banhart’s label. ‘Gnomonsong’ is raw
and lo fi, but after a couple of listens
through the shoegaze emerges some ad-
dictive melodies. Sometime the album
is victim of its own downtempo pace
and feels at times uncohesive, however
it is clear that this band do have poten-
tial, their sound just needs to become a
little more focused.

When two things of immense beauty combine, strange things can
happen. In this case, music and majesty create brilliance
tra was slightly infuriating…
Next on the menu was Dorian Con-
cept. I’m rather embarrassed to admit
that, for me, his music was slightly
overshadowed by the London Met-
ropolitan Orchestra’s performance.
Compared with the rich, multi-layered
classical melodies, his somewhat flat
post-rock didn’t play my ears with
quite the same dexterity. Although
things turned for the better when he
moved to scat jazz his drummer unfor-
tunately stole his thunder with his fren-
zied bebopping.
Then finally, the main course. It’s hard

As the days get shorter and the morn-
ings far too bloody cold, this duo from
Sussex provide the perfect soundtrack
to our ailing weather. Producing lustful
and haunting blues-folk, their sound is
at its best when it adds a touch of Amer-
icana to the classic English setting.
The lazy slide guitar stomp of ‘Strange
Moon Rising’ conjures images of New
Orleans swamps, and the distorted blues
guitar at the end of ‘Summer Fades’
helps elevate the track about the rest of
the album. The songs merge together so
well that it’s over just as soon as it’s be-
gun, fleeting but in a good way.

to convey (impossible actually) the ef-
fect of The Cinematic Orchestra’s
wistful music in the splendour of the
Royal Albert Hall. The acoustics were
pitch-perfect. The London Metropoli-
tan Orchestra, who were backing them,
would swoosh in to sprinkle that some-
thing extra as a song crescendoed. The
vocals fizzed with emotion and when
‘To Build A Home’ was performed at the
end of the set, there was nothing to do
but close my eyes and self-indulge in
tearful nostalgia.
As I left the Royal Albert Hall, I
looked back and realized even more
strongly, that although creative expres-
sion is subjective, there are some things
that are brilliant and no rational person
could disagree . The Royal Albert Hall
as a venue is brilliant. The Cinematic
Orchestra is brilliant. And The Cin-
ematic Orchestra at the Royal Albert
Hall is simply sublime.
