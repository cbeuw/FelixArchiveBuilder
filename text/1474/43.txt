the UK can have better health management,
at Accenture you too could be having an
impact on people, technology and business
across the world.
With a predicted or actual 2:1 in any degree
and 340 UCAS points, a genuine interest in
technology and business, and bags of ambition,
you could enjoy a salary of £31,500 plus a
£10,000 sign-on bonus. Not forgetting the
opportunity to achieve more than you ever
thought possible.
