COMMENT
W
e are all somewhat
superficial. Looks
are an easy way to
gauge the physi-
ological and genetic
stature of a potential mate (someone
with one non-functional eye and no legs
probably won’t be any good at fending
off savage beasts), and so evolution has
designed human beings to judge other
members of the species largely on their
appearance. We all do it, however ve-
hemently some of us might try to deny
it. Why else would our favourite maga-
zines be filled with advice from the ar-
cane and mysterious world of fashion
about what to wear and, much more im-
portantly, what not to wear?
Thousands of products designed spe-
cifically to mask the hideous blemishes
and other imperfections that afflict us
litter the shelves of almost any pharma-
cy you could name. We strive endlessly
to improve our appearance because we
know how important it is, with wonder-
ful television shows like Extreme Make-
over actively encouraging us to hack
our repulsive faces apart in the name of
beauty.
Black Sheep
For both the less aesthetically pleasing
members of the public and those semi-
humans so unbearably hideous that they
refrain from most social interaction
(among whom I sorrowfully count my-
self), this almost universal preoccupa-
tion with the cool and sexy is fairly dis-
piriting. Shows like Entourage do their
level best to make you feel suicidally in-
adequate unless you happen to be a gor-
geous billionaire actor, while the mere
sight of the buxom beauties in Desper-
ate Housewives sends most women into
a mad frenzy of jealousy.
New toothpastes, moisturisers, and
hair products are marketed to the down-
trodden, unsightly masses, and those
masses, motivated by sheer self-loath-
ing, buy them in enormous numbers. We
try so insanely hard to make ourselves
look presentable that, paradoxically,
most of our efforts simply exacerbate
the problem, fueling an extremely pow-
erful low self-esteem engine.
Despite some minor successes in
modifying ourselves, we remain largely
the same, and, unfortunately, so does the
importance of our appearance. What a
conundrum! What on earth is there to
do? Are you destined to become as un-
healthily bitter and angry as it is becom-
ing increasingly obvious I am? Well, as
an unattractive individual myself, I find
it productive and moderately therapeutic
to channel my resentment and rage into
small, barely read columns in university
newspapers. This somewhat alleviates
the crushing misery of my virtually in-
tolerable existence. I jest, of course (but,
depressingly, only very slightly).
The search for a happy middle ground
is the goal as far as this issue is con-
cerned. The opinions of other people
(be they respected friends or anonymous
simpletons) are rarely worth ignoring
entirely or taking so seriously that they
send you into a spiraling depression.
Appearance is important, and people do
make judgements based on it, but take
solace in the fact that different people
often appreciate different looks, one of
which may be yours (sadly for me, the
scruffy, gangly student look isn’t cur-
rently in vogue). There is much, much
more to you, and everyone else, than
your appearance, and if you’re still
not convinced, there’s always Extreme
Makeover.
I
was back home the other day,
clearing out the attic, where, in-
explicably, a great deal of my
dearest childhood possessions
had wound up; cherished dolls,
knitted by a late grandmother; industri-
ous railway tracks by Brio and Tomy;
and enough Lego to fill a skip. I was
conflicted. On the one hand, relieved;
my parents had said they had all been
stolen one night by goblins. On the other
hand, betrayed; my parents had lied to
me. And if they lied to me about this,
what other pillars of my reality are built
on quicksand. Father Christmas? The
Tooth Fairy? Say it ain’t so!
But parental deceit aside, I also came
across a set of photographs I had at
Sixth Form. Proper photography; with
darkrooms, heady chemical fugs, and
bearded men swearing at size zero su-
permodels. As I drifted from print to
print – out of focus, blurry and overex-
posed – I came to realise something. I
love photography.
Despite centuries of bizarrely be-
decked fellows in pulpits assuring them
that there is an afterlife of an eternal
persuasion, men have sought immortal-
ity – usually vicariously through great
works. The Pyramids at Giza, defeat-
ing the French (at anything) or even A
Clockwork Orange. The gist of this be-
Rhys Davies
ing that if someone remembers you, then
in some way, you’ll still be alive. Admit-
tedly, not in the way that really counts,
but it’s something.
And that’s what I like about photog-
raphy. Photos are a window into our
past. And it’s not just the great and the
grand. You can look back in your family
albums, smile at relatives long-dead and
recall their adventures and anecdotes.
Photography has offered immortality to
the common man in far greater numbers
than any religious leader.
But there is a twist to this, a hellfire to
this eternity. Photos, especially now, in
the days of digital and disposable cam-
eras, have become...repetitive. Open any
packet of holiday snaps and I guarantee
that the majority of photos will be of
families smiling in front of each and
every minor landmark, with the occa-
sional mother reclining on a sun-bed in
the shade.
Exhibit B, Facebook, that testament to
our age. Select an album at a random and
have a quick e-flick through. You will
see a group of friends, with some varia-
tions and substitutions, in a club, bar, or
party somewhere, smiling, cheering, and
generally indicating how they’re having
a grand old time. Now, go to the next
album. See anything different?
I’m not saying we shouldn’t record
the good times. But when our grandchil-
dren, or scouts from an alien race (Or
both), go through these documents of
our existence, I’m sure they’ll reach the
conclusion that we lived in a permanent
state of bliss and that the Eiffel Tower is
only a measuring rule for getting a photo
straight. It’s repetitive, it’s monotonous,
it’s boring. Of course we should remem-
ber times when we were happy, but we
should also recall when we were sad or
angry, when we were lonely and sick,
to complement and contrast. Only then
can we remember ourselves and be re-
membered as people, living, breathing
humans – not some horrible all-smiling
monstrosity from a Batman serial.
What I’m saying is that photos should
be our biographies. And unlike written
biographies, they’re notoriously easy to
make. All we have to do is live – some-
thing I find comes naturally to most peo-
ple. The man with the camera will do the
rest.
They’re also more powerful. They say
a picture says a thousand words, and I
think they’re right. Do you really need
words when you see photographs of the
Twin Towers or 7/7? Or how about when
the Berlin Wall came down? Or that one
with Einstein sticking his tongue out?
And with that, there’s nothing left for
me to say but – CHEESE!
Photos can make us immortal

“Evolution has

Thanks to the NUS
rioters, we all look
like morons
We all judge people on looks
As a general principle I hate
protests. I would happily bet
you my life savings, the savings
of my future children, and the
eternal souls of all of my an-
cestors that in a large enough
sample of protestors, 50%
haven’t got a fucking clue what
they are protesting about.
That is not to say that you
can’t have intelligent protests.
The Science Is Vital protests
outside Westminster in early
October were intelligent, well-
organised, and above all, real-
istic. If protests were cars they
would definitely be of German
make.
Extending the metaphor, the
recent NUS protest would be
the rusty old banger you buy
from a man called Joe who
perpetually squints at you,
when your financial situation
has gone through rock bot-
tom and is plummeting toward
shit creek. This isn’t because
I fundamentally disagree with
what the protests were about,
though for the record, I do. It is
because I thought that as the
‘academically elite’, we could
come up with better placards
than ‘Fuck Fees’, and not re-
sort to violence.
It is true that the rioters were
a small minority. But that’s not
the point. The general public
will only remember thuggish
students pictured smashing
windows and being morons in
general.
The NUS could have asked
the students to withdraw from
the Millbank building, to dis-
tance themselves from the
extremists. Or you know, actu-
ally have adequate numbers of
organisers to prevent this sort
of situation.
We are all going to be tarred
with the same brush by the
public. The NUS march hasn’t
shown ‘unity’, or that students
are ‘serious about the issue of
the cap’, but that a number of
students are inarticulate, thug-
gish brutes. No doubt any day
soon the headline ‘Students
Cause Cancer’ will be an ex-
clusive in the Daily Mail, and
old ladies will complain to local
radio stations about how ‘stu-
dents are dragging this country
down’.
