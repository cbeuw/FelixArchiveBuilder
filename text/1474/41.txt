If you’ve ever played minesweeper, then
you should be able to understand this
puzzle. The number in each box repre-
sents the number of lines that can exist
around it. Lines can never cross! In the
end, you will end up with a closed loop.
Just have a look at the solution in the op-
posite page.

A sudoku? With words?
I know anything that isn’t a
series of numbers is confusing
to the average Imperial student,
but just think of this puzzle as a
collection of weird symbols that
define some new constants. For
the advanced wordsmiths among
us, a word or phrase will appear
when the grid is completed.
Other than that, normal sudoku
rules apply. Every row, column
and 3x3 square must contain
each symbol once and once only.
