T
he new ICU Energy Society
seeks to provide a portal for
all students interested in
energy.
Over £53 million per
year is invested in energy-related re-
search across Imperial. The depart-
ments and research groups conducting
these fascinating research and educa-
tion programs are very diverse, encom-
passing distributed academic networks
in the physical and biological sciences,
engineering and business. Whilst this
is a great strength, it means that find-
ing out about energy-related projects
and events can sometimes be challeng-
ing. The ICU Energy Society seeks to
provide a portal for all students, includ-
ing undergraduates, MScs, MBAs and
PhDs, so that they may foster infor-
mation sharing, collaboration and the
building of a vibrant energy community
on campus.
Central to achieving these goals is
the creation of a networking platform
for all students interested in energy.
The ICU Energy Society provides a
website digesting the energy-related
news and events from on- and off-
campus and a free mailing list. A key
provision currently being developed is
a discussion forum on the IC network
to facilitate cross-disciplinary discus-
sion. In addition to aggregating and
advertising existing activities, we have
begun to organise our own workshops,
seminars and social events. Themes of
events already being planned include
private investment in renewable en-
ergy; the challenge for offshore wind;
carbon footprinting; careers in energy
and sustainability; Clean Development
in China; business opportunities in en-
ergy; a visit to Battersea power station
and many more.
The Energy Society is always looking
for new members and new ideas, and
involvement can be anything from at-
tending one of our events to organising
one yourself. Find out more at www.

Imperial College experts took a key
role in the recently-published Roadmap
2050, a study of the pathways to a low-
carbon Europe in 2050 led by the Eu-
ropean Climate Foundation. Alongside
collaborators McKinsey & Company,
KEMA and Oxford Economics, the En-
ergy Futures Lab at Imperial assessed
the technical and economic require-
ments, and implementation challenges,
towards meeting the European Council
targets of an 80–95% reduction in CO2
from 1990 levels by 2050.
The Roadmap focuses on the power
sector, where a large share of the decar-
bonisation must happen. The study anal-
yses the potential impact of several tech-
nologies in which Imperial has a strong
research profile, including flat-panel and
concentrated solar PV, nuclear fission
and carbon capture and storage. The re-
port concludes that Europe already has
the necessary skills, technology, capital
and industrial capability to make the
transition to a low-carbon economy. It
found that, whilst the techno-economic
challenges will be great, the greatest
challenge may be to obtain broad, active
support for the transition across regions,
sectors and political parties.
Current policies and regulations are
shown to be well short of what is re-
quired; the Roadmap concludes that an
earnest decarbonisation effort must be
started within around five years to make
achieving the targets realistic. The good
news for policy-makers, the report finds,
is that if efficiency improvements are
made alongside power decarbonisation,
the transition can lead to higher eco-
nomic growth and net positive job cre-
ation up to 2050. The full report can be
read at www.roadmap2050.eu/.
Three years ago the Union passed its
Environmental policy. It has achieved
some substantial gains, such as install-
ing motions sensors on lights in the
Union, to turn them off and save energy
when the room isn’t being used.
We now use only recycled paper, and
all publicity is printed on Forest Stew-
ardship Council certified paper. Most
Club, Society & Project forms are now
online, saving paper.
The new Environmental Policy for the
next three years should use these and
other benchmarks to take the Union for-
ward. It’s up to you what we do, so get
in touch. Options could be: getting rid of
bottled water, stricter controls on leav-
ing electronic equipment on overnight,
or even biodiesel in the minibuses.
Get in touch at president@imperial.
ac.uk and we can send you the updated
policy as it stands. Alex Kendall
I’m generally against people preaching
about vegetarian/veganism, it’s against
what Veg Soc is all about. So let’s as-
sume that you asked us why vegetables
are awesome for the environment.
To keep it simple, red meat and dairy
are pretty bad in terms of emissions per
calorie. It comes down to the inefficiency
in converting plant foods into animal pro-
teins, try and remember back to GCSE
Biology here. Before someone brings up
the classic ‘surely the food miles on that
cancels it out’ argument, this includes
transportation emissions. In fact, chang-
ing to a vegetable-based diet decreases
emissions more than eight-fold in com-
parison to magically having all your food
produced on your doorstep. Let’s face it
though, who’s going to go through all
that effort for Mr. Environment?
So here’s the game plan, red meat and
dairy are the worst offenders; for the
more apathetic, moving away from these
to chicken/fish/eggs for one day per week
is as good as having ‘zero food miles’.
Though in reality, having one vegetable
day per week is pretty easy (whilst lack-
ing the usual health concerns) and beats
our fantasy transport-free situation. If
you’re interested in the health and envi-
ronmental aspects of vegetable-based di-
ets check out our website for fully cited
discussions. Meanwhile, enjoy our reci-
