Nine months is a long time in Formula 1. In
March the motoring clique feverishly an-
ticipated the return of the seven-times world
champion Michael Schumacher. Arguably the
best driver in the history of the sport was mak-
ing an epic comeback, driving the car that was
originally intended for the then current world
champion Jenson Button. But the enticing com-
bination did not work. What could have been
the fastest driver in the fastest car turned out
to be a disappointingly mediocre mix, lingering
far behind the pace of Red Bull, Ferrari, and
McLaren. The legendary German just did not
know when to pack it in – Take That, take note.
That Sebastian Vettel, also known as “Baby
Schuey”, took the 2010 crown on the week-
end only serves to underline how the sport has
moved on from the days when the season re-
sults read: Australia: Schumacher 1st, Brazil:
Schumacher 1st, Malaysia: Schumacher 1st…
well, you get the gist. Or has it?
Back in 2002, Ferrari manipulated the Aus-
trian GP by ordering Rubens Barrichello to
allow Schumacher, his teammate, to overtake
Eventual 2010 World Champion, Sebastian Vettel making his way around the spectacular Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi
and win the race. The farce led to a ban on
team orders, that did not stop Ferrari repeat-
ing the same trick this year, when in Germa-
ny they asked Felipe Massa to let Fernando
Alonso through. This was a direct breach of
the sport’s regulations: article 39.1 states that
“team orders which interfere with a race re-
sult are prohibited”. Article 151.c reads “any
fraudulent conduct or any act prejudicial to the
interests of any competition, or to the interests
of motorsport generally” can be punished. Yet
Ferrari got away with a slap on the wrist and
a paltry (in F1 terms) fine of $100,000. That
Jean Todt, the president of the FIA, claimed
there was not enough evidence to convict the
prancing horse was a complete kick in the
teeth to all F1 fans who believe in racing. Sad-
ly, Ferrari are still very much the darlings of
the FIA. It should be a PR relief to Ecclestone
and Todt that Alonso did not win this year’s
championship – far from being a gallant pranc-
ing horse, the Spaniard would have resembled
a Machiavellian limping donkey. It is certainly
poetic justice.
The other unpleasant boil on the face of F1
is the teams that make up the back of the grid.
Again in 2002, Minardi were the comedians of
F1, qualifying over four seconds off the pole
sitter. Imagine a 100 metres race between Us-
ain Bolt and a Zimmer frame yielding granny.
Minardi have since disappeared from the sport,
though another three verrucas materialised in
their place: Virgin, Hispania, and Lotus Rac-
ing. The latter has nothing in common with
the legendary team of the 1970s other than
the name. These teams are to racing what Ann
Widdecombe is to dancing. Virgin were not
even capable of designing cars with the right
size fuel tank to get to the end of races! What
should we read into Richard Branson’s recent
disinvestment of his shareholding in the team?
Is F1 not supposed to be the pinnacle of mo-
torsport?
Let us not detract from the wonders the 2010
season had to offer. It was as exciting as Ange-
lina Jolie’s bottom - five drivers were in con-
tention for the championship right up until the
last races. Vettel had not lead the championship
this season until the moment it mattered most;
at the chequered flag on Sunday. Next year, five
world champions will be in the hunt – Miss Jo-
lie’s posterior has some serious competition.

Rugby slump to first defeat
Any hopes that the Imperial College 1st XV
had of remaining unbeaten in the league this
season were quashed on Wednesday. They
were on the receiving end of a 39-13 drubbing
at the hands of Reading on an overcast and
cold afternoon.
Imperial had gone into the game knowing
that it was the most important of their season
so far; Imperial and Reading both stood at the
summit of the league with both teams unbeat-
en. As only one team gains promotion a victory
would have put Imperial above their closest ri-
vals and in pole position to achieve their goal.
Throughout the warm up Imperial had looked
sharp and focused; team moves looked slick
and precise. A solitary penalty was Imperial’s
only contribution to the first half score line;
Reading had scored two penalties and a con-
verted try. Their lead was minimal and had
been gifted to them through Imperials own
mistakes and inability to convert their hard
work and endeavour into points.
Imperial hit back in the second half with a
try finished by the forwards rumbling over the
try line.
The very next play resulted in a Reading
score from an interception pass. Further tries
were added from slopping play by Imperial re-
sulting in a score line which not only flattered
their hosts but gave them an impressive points
difference which may be influential in a pro-
motion decider.
The game and the manner in which it was
lost will hopefully serve as a wake up call to a
talented squad who now realise that they can-
not expect to be gifted results; they have to be
earned.
