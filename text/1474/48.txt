C&G 38 - 24 RSM
C&G record historic victory
Sunday was not only for remembering
those lost, but also for creating new
history. The day for mourning was ear-
marked for the battle between two past
greats; it was time for the annual C&G
vs. RSM grudge match. A gloomy start
saw both teams arrive an hour after the
scheduled kick-off time due to the ever
reliable London Transport Network.
After a quick jog from both teams
and some imaginative lineout calls be-
ing thought of the game kicked-off. The
engineers quickly took advantage of the
RSM’s lack of pace and Sasha Maitala
scored his first of two tries punching
through the gaps left by the props in the
miner’s back line. The engineers didn’t
give the RSM time to think when a few
phases later Rob Dowden slotted a kick
through the eye of a needle and into the
hands of Tom Beswetherick on the RSM
try line, the score line rose to 14-0. The
engineers made it look easy. The RSM
pack hastily stepped up to the plate and
produced some fabulous forward play
giving RSM fly half Louie Barnét a
great platform to work off. A few phases
later the RSM were back in the game
and the engineers looked worried.
The miners constantly used their Rus-
sian spawned battering ram Bogdan Go-
lenkov to try and pierce the engineer’s
defensive line; however the C&G had an
answer in the form of James Allan and
debut rugby player Lukas Michalitsch,
both of whom putting in some crunch-
ing tackles to stop the beast in his tracks.
The game was closely fought with
regular tries from both sides. The RSM
looked like taking the lead on several oc-
casions most notable after a well earned
try from Simon Fenton in the centres
(one of six props in the starting line up
for the miners). Their organisation in the
pack was very impressive; however, due
to some great upfront tackling and some
good old fashioned flare, the engineers
took the victory.
The final score: 38-24 to C&G. The
last time this happened was 17 years
ago. The RSM have definitely got some
work to do if they wish to reclaim their
precious bottle. C&G have offered some
coaching tips but are yet to hear back.
Man of the match went to Rob
Dowden for his fantastic kicking game
and special mention must also go to Sa-
sha Maitala and Tom Beswetherick for
some great performances in the backs.
A 6.30am start proved no hindrance to
Imperial College Ultimate at Indoor Re-
gionals 2010 as dD once again secured
their place at Nationals in Wolverhamp-
ton. Three teams were sent to compete
in Sutton, south London; the first team
competed against the best in the South
East, whilst two further teams of new
players held their own to learn the game
in a competitive environment.
The first game of the day saw dD play
Brunel. The transition from the outdoor
game, having only five players and
competing on a hardwood pitch roughly
the size of a basketball court, played in
Brunel’s favour as they played a zone
defence through which dD struggled to
break. Despite better communication
and flow, and a late resurgence, Brunel
took the game by one point.
Sublime, from the University of Ports-
mouth, were dD’s next opponents. Last
year’s national champions both out-
doors and indoors, Imperial were proud
to make them work hard for their points
during the game and managed to break
through the Portsmouth defence on sev-
eral occasions. Eventually Portsmouth’s
inherent quality shone through, leaving
the south coast team as deserved win-
ners.
The match against HU?, from Royal
Holloway, became a must-win game if
dD wanted to qualify for Nationals 2010.
Starting with the intensity that was lack-
ing in the first two games, Imperial put
enough points on the board to guarantee
victory despite a late HU? comeback.
This momentum carried through into the
following game against Chichester, who
had no reply to the improving Imperial
team which beat them comfortably.
Playing with confidence and flair, dD
faced up to local rivals UCL. Normally
challengers for a place at Nationals, the
Under Cover Lovers were destroyed by
an Imperial team which shut down their
offensive plays, had runs of up to sixty
completed passes and tactically decon-

will head to the Wolverhampton
Nationals to defend their title
