All three teams are having a successful
season and it has been forecast that IC will
win all tnree divisions. The first team nas
entertained several teams at home this sea-
son. We put up a good performance against
Berks, and Bucks. County Team of 8 and
especially so in the second half. IC finally
drew after pulling up a deficit of 20 imps
at half time.
For the second year in succession we were
drawn against Harrison Gray's team in the
London Championship Team of 4. They
fielded their strongest team consisting of M .
Harrison Gray, A . Rose, R. and J. Sharpies
(all Life Masters) and F. North and J. Pugh
(both National Masters). Needless to say we
expected to be rather outclassed but this
did not prove to be the case.
After 8 boards there was no swing and
after 16 boards we were only one new imp
down. On board 13th we had a very unlucky
swing.
West Dealt. Love all.

After North had led the Ace of hearts,
the queen of hearts served as a discard for
a club dammy. Declarers only play now is
to trap a singleton king of hearts. As this
was right we lost 11 imps on the board, our
other pair playing in only 5s. This repre-
sented a swing of 22 imps on the board and
our chance of a sizeable lead at half-time
had gone. The second half was fought out
keenly but we finally lost by 17 new imps.
The performance of IC in these matches
has undoubtedly raised the prestige of the
College in bridge circles.
Both the first and second teams have won
their rounds in the Hospitals aand College
Cup and it is quite possible that the final
will be a repeats of last year's clash. IC is
also supplying by far the bulk of the Uni-
versity team at present.
We have held three pairs contests, so far,
and it is hoped to hold another befor Xmas
vacation. A l l have been well supported and
all members are welcome to play. Guests are
invited.
Since our last report the mixed team has
chalked up three consecutive 9-0 wins, over
London Hosp., L.S.E., and Q.M.C. The
ladies team suprised us all by beating Royal
Holloway 7-2.
The men's team have also been going a
good account of themselves. The 2nd team,
after losing 6-3 to L.S E. 1 and Q.M.C. 1,
beat Chelsea 1 by the same score. The lst
team beat Battersea 6-3 on a highly mobile
playing surface! The match was noted for the
fine play in the game between the Batter-
sea first pair and I.C.'s Pete Semple and Sar-
frez Ahmed. Fresher Pete Semple is proving
to be a valuable asset to the club. Last week
the lst team beat an uninspired L.S.E. team
9-0, to remain undefeated so far this season.

This was one of the best Cabarets of re-
cent years, with the possible exception of
last year's R.C.S. effort. The production was
somewhat varied; at best quite hilarious, at
worst entertaining, and it succeeded in keep-
ing the congragation with the cast throughout.
The producer appears to have been Dick
Foster, or Jon Bareford, or some combin-
ation of the two, occasionally hindered by
D. Lain, and assisted backstage by Norman
Franklin and an unnamed Guilds' electrician.
Their Neolithic Nights was a fine attempt at
this most difficult type of production.
Of the various items in the Cabaret, un-
doubtedly the most effective were the Queer
Song and the neat Bus Stop sketch — al-
though, musically, the opening 'Great One'
(who was he?) and the 'Rock Song' were
also good. Dick Foster is to be congratulated
on a startling appearance as two different
vehicles, and 'Angela' made a delightful Miss
Conception — not, perhaps so revealing a
role as last year's, though! Jeff the Caveman
and the gentleman with the lawnmo'ver also
seemed fully conversant with their roles. Fin-
ally, a note of praise to the Omega Society,
for participation without destruction, j.w.
