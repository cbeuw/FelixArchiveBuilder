Anyone who hasn’t been living in a nuclear bunker
for the last six years cannot fail to have noted
the seemingly unstoppable rise in popularity of
that past time once solely the joy of the music
connoisseur, watching live bands. And if you love to
see live bands then there is no better place to spend
the warm summer months than swanning
from festival to festival.
This year we feel it is becoming
increasingly desirable to explore
European festivals. Less crowded,
less rain, more adventure
and better value for money
overall than a good deal of the
burgeoning money spinners
masquerading as festivals over
here in good ol’ Blighty.
That’s not to say there aren’t
some wonderful English
dates for your dairy this year
–The Isle of Wight Festival,
Wild in The Country,
Latitude and who could
dare to omit Reading
Festival. We’re not going
O
ne of the strongest
draws of Dour is
without a doubt its
programme. Every
year at Dour you get
a unique international bill (bands
were coming from 28 different
countries last year) that’s different,
alternative, independent, ambitious
and sharp with an accent on new
discoveries. All that at a very low
price that can’t be beaten.
Since its beginning the Dour Fes-
tival has owed much of its appeal to
its incredible atmosphere. A multi-
cultural audience that shares a love
for music and partying creates a fun
vibe throughout the site. The Dour
Festival has become the unmiss-
able music event of the summer
for thousands of music fans across
Europe.
Like every summer the festival
will be held on the 3rd weekend of
July, by the spoil heaps of the old
coal mining site ‘La Plaine de La
Machine a Feu’. Dour the village is
situated in the south of Belgium, by
the French Border. For 4 days over
200 bands will play their tunes on
2 open-air stages and 4 marquees
in front of an avid audience. This
is the festival that never sleeps with
non stop music from 12am until
5am the next day.
The festival’ social agenda is not a
sideshow anymore. People come to
Dour to get informed as well thanks
to our NGO village. This summer
will be the 4th time the festival will
welcome many social and political
associations to inform the festival
goers about NGO’s and what can
be done to help the planet.
We were lucky enough to get to
Dour festival last year, and in our
opinion, having attended almost
every UK festival over the last 12
years, this was by far one of the
best we’ve seen. The tickets are cra-
zy cheap (85 Euros for 4 days), and
if you’re so cheap you can’t even af-
ford to pay for some (like us) then
we seriously suggest you email in to
win a pair of free tickets, because
you’ll have an almost 100% chance
of winning.

R
ock Werchter 2008
will take place from
Thursday 3 until
Sunday 6 July at Wer-
chter’s Festival Park.
The festival is a broad overview of
all the interesting and good things
that are going on in pop, rock and
dance. The best rock band in the
world, the most exciting young
British bands, the new kings of
dance,thereturnofsomeold-time
favourites. Guitars, electro, loved,
unknown, headbang, sing along,
dance, everything! As always, big
names and established acts will
be playing the Main Stage, these
include Radiohead, R.E.M., Jus-
tice, The Chemical Brothers and
many, many more. The Pyramid
Marquee is reserved for upcom-
ing talent and more intimate acts
from around Europe.
Every day, there is room for
80,000 visitors, and the large spac-
es mean you won’t be crammed
up against some wasted, sweaty
fellow festival goer everywhere
you step. ..
Always pulling huge names, It’s
hard to believe this massive four
day event grew out of a small
blues festival in 1975, but since
its first incarnation the event has
housed musical giants such as
David Bowie, The Specials, Muse
and Radiohead and more.
This festival is our top sugges-
tion for the summer, four days
long and less than the price of a
standard UK festival you can see a
ridiculously large number of huge
acts for just one ticket. Tickets
are available from www.rockwer-
chter.be and cost 160 Euros.
With all the insanely cheap
beer you can drink (not Carling
either), amazing bands, cheap
food, cheap ticket, cheap Eurostar
tickets available at the moment,
great weather and lack of 16 year
old rich indie kids filling the place
up you’d be crazy to opt for one of
the bigger UK festivals.
