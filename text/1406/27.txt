Virgo
This week you
audition for a Cillit
Bang advert. You’re
going up against
Barry Scott because
for some reason
he has to audition for absolutely every advert
he wants to be in. You dub yourself Barry
Scoot. It comes to audition day. Barry’s givin’
it large and all that jazz, so in an attempt to
cut him down in his prime you plant him with
chloroform, cut a small opening in his thigh
and tongue it with all your might. Winner.
Scorpio
This week your
brother shrinks you
with the laser he’s
been developing
for quite some
time. Instead of
a dramatic Hollywood-esque situation, you
measure a vast 4 foot, 3 inches. Whaddya you
mean you don’t use Imperial measurements?!
You stupid dick face. No one actually
understands metres and centimetres. Get
out of my country you silly mong. How many
metres away is home? eh? EH? Moron.
Libra
This week you take a
trip into the future.
Upon arriving
you discover that
the upper half of
your body failed
to make it through the portal. That’s right
you are a pair of legs, with no worries in the
36th century. There’s so much to see... Uh
experience... Uh walk to and all the time in the
world. Unfortunately, you just fall over... sigh
Sagittarius
This week you dis-
cover the downside
to making close
friends. When you
were just aquaint-
ances you censored
your behaviour and personality, and people
thought you were normal. Now that you feel
more relaxed around them you tell them that
it is you that writes the Horoscopes. They are
disgusted, not because of the crude nature of
the horoscopes but because that pulsing vein
in your eye is kinda weird... seriously
Capricorn
This week in a mo-
ment of spontane-
ous adventure you
ride your motorbike
to Cuba. 10 metres
off the coast you
realise that neither you, your motorbike nor
the sandwich you were keeping for the journey
are waterproof and decide to head back. You
return to Beit Quad to find a bunch of goons in
facepaint singing “BOWIES IN SPACEEE”
Cancer
...Instead of being
deported you’re
given a life sentence
in a minimum
security prison.
You become even
more demoralised with life especially with the
ease at which you can escape from the prison.
You try to find meaning by beating the world
record for the number of murders committed.
58,000,003 never seemed so far away.
Gemini
This week you try
your best to get
deported. Police still
won’t arrest you for
cannabis possession
and that girl you
raped won’t talk. Last time you tried to blow
up a public building, some bloke named Abdul
got the blame. You resign yourself to a fate in
a cold, lifeless country. When someone points
out how easy it is to get a flight out, you gash
him in the face with your deadly Shank. It
turns out to be the Prime Minister...
Leo
This week the Editor
scares you, but the
kind of ‘scares’ that
kind of arouses
you. You know like
when you’re walking
through the park late at night, and a man
points a gun at your head and says “give me
your money” but all you really want to give
him is your virginity? Or when a dog is barking
at you but you imagine it saying “I don’t bite...
hard”. You know what I’m saying, yeh bruv?
Yeh? No? No... Awkward... Awwwwkward
Taurus
This week you are
mysteriously trans-
ported to John Len-
non’s boudoir. He
proclaims his love
for you and throws
Yoko out the window. In an avant-garde twist
she writes a poem on the way down entitled
“Am I falling or is the ground rocketing up-
wards?” Regardless she face-plants the pave-
ment with a satisfying crack, splat and oooh
baby, faceless corpse. Lennon peers out of the
window, undresses and you get it on.
Aries
Your interest in
your crippled,
blind, impotent and
generally broken
boyfriend rekindles.
After destroying his
life, he has no choice but to love you. As you
lay down at the end of the first day of the rest
of your lives together, you feel his shattered
tibia invading your personal space. You push
him off the bed onto the cold hard floor.
Pisces
This week your
blind boyfriend
loses all interest. He
explains “basically,
you were like, well
fit, but now you’re
like, just well annoying. Innit blud.” You cry
yourself to sleep but then get revenge by push-
ing him down a flight of stairs. Painful and
politically incorrect. You stand atop the stairs
cackling manically, before turning to your
chalkboard with your plans for world domina-
tion scrawled on its dark surface.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week you and
two of your friends
are naked in your
room with your
boyfriend. You drive
him wild with all
manners of teasing but in a sudden change of
mood berate him for looking. How dare he get
turned on when I kiss and touch my friends!
Fucking pervert. I’m going to rip out his eye
balls with a blunt spoon, then ram them in a
blender and turn that bitch up to 11. BRRUU-
URRRNNNNNN. Splat. Eyeball soup. Pwned.

Needy McNeedy: pwning n00bs on 56k modems
S
ometimes people come up
to me and they just start tell-
ing me intricate details about
their lives. It’s not my fault; I
don’t even ask them to. I must
just have a kind face or something.
(I’m pulling my most sympathetic face
right now; it’s pretty damn caring.)
Email your problems to agony.felix@
imperial.ac.uk. I can send you a pic-
ture of the caring face in return. It’ll
brighten up your day.
Dear Needy McNeedy,
So... had the exams, did the exams.
I thought it went quite well, thanks
for asking. Then I partied quite hard,
drank a lot, vomited on the Rector’s
shoes (ok so I made that bit up) and
concentrated on getting over my
hangover.
But now the hangover’s gone, and
so is the revision, and life should be
sweeeet. (And it is: I’m having a bril-
liant time getting drunk 24/7) But
slowly my money is draining away.
How do I go about getting one of those
job things?
MoreBeerPlease
Dear MoreBeerPlease,
From experience, you definitely don’t
need any of the following things to get
a job: CV, cover letter, interview. At
least not the kind of job I think would
suit your kind (i.e. one that pays well
for little effort). There are some things
you do need, however.
They are: a vast majority of acquaint-
ances with jobs, good bribery mate-
rial, and, if possible, something which
would put you in a minority group.
This makes you instantly employable.
I’d advise you to carry on partying
as hard as you can until you’ve made
enough friends and then let them get
your new job for you.
If this fails, I’m beginning to need a
secretary to cope with the deluge of
emails from poor confused students.
Applicants please email their party
invitations to agony.felix@imperial.
ac.uk.

Dear Needy McNeedy,
I’ve been with my long-term girlfriend
for about a year and a half, and it’s
still going really well. Recently, one of
my ex-girlfriends started to message
me on Facebook, and then we started
texting each other. Yesterday she sug-
gested that she should come down and
stay with me in London. I think she
thinks we’re going out. How do I break
the news about my girlfriend?
BlueEyes
Dear BlueEyes,
Definitely don’t tell her. Picture the
scene: one day you are an old man,
with various small children sitting gaz-
ing at you from a rug by a fire, plead-
ing with you to tell them the exciting
story about when you were young and
had to juggle two girlfriends. This is
perfect Hollywood romantic comedy
material, why would you throw it all
away?
Just make sure you’ve picked which
one you’re actually going to end up
with before the ex arrives, and pick
that very weekend to propose to either
of them. Or both.

Dear Desperate,
My parents have recently decided to
get divorced. I thought their mutual
disdain would last forever, but they
have decided to enforce their misery
on the unsuspecting public instead.
My mum believes this is a new lease of
life for her, and during a phone call the
other day she told me that she wants
to come and live in London with me.
How can I keep her out of my life?
Desperate
Dear Desperate,
How dare you treat your mother
with such disrespect? If you’ve been
through the experience of halls, it’s
pretty much overrated living without
your parents. Nobody else will pick
your festering washing off the floor
and return it, ironed and folded, into
your drawers. Nobody else will pay
for your food. (That is, unless you get
a long suffering and mistreated girl-
friend.) Call her and ask when she can
move in.
