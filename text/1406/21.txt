Music
Music Editors – Peter Sinclair and Susan Yu
“I go to the toilet with Mark”
Susan Yu
Music Editor
W
hen the going gets
tough, the tough
gets going.... These
lyrics certainly ring
a lot of truth for me
right now. Exams and revision are tak-
ing their toll as I had feared. Do I even
have time to write about music, I ask
myself? This will be the last issue that
I’ll write for this academic year-a big
fat tear rolls off onto the keyboard as I
type this. Well, no, not really. I’m glad
my first year at uni has been relatively
smooth. Writing for Felix has been a
chore at times but most of the time, I’ve
truly loved being a Music Editor, albeit
not for very long, having only come on
board this year. Anyway, with regards
to being sad that I’m approaching the
demise of freshers year, I have to say, I
am glad that I haven’t perished or done
something stupid/crazy. I don’t get too
emotional, but when I do, you’d better
stay well clear from me. This year is
drawing to a close, soon it will really be
the summer holidays. Can’t wait! I’m
simply dying to be free from having my
nose stuck in gazillions of textbooks,
scruffy, messed-up revision notes and
what have you not.
Recently, I ventured into the music
rooms and allowed myself a glorious
moment of much craved-for peace, im-
mersing myself in the absolutely sooth-
ing melodies of Chopin, Beethoven and
other lovely classical piano compos-
ers. To top it up, I played some jazzy/
chilled out stuff by Norah Jones as well
as contemporary indie/pop/rock songs
by gems like Keane and Oasis. The pi-
ano really has healing powers...
Aside, has anyone bothered to watch
the Eurovision contest? I didn’t bother
but I’m sure some of you readers out
there may have felt obliged to lend
your eyes to cringing talentless musi-
cal wannabies trying to flaunt their
stuff on TV. Is it any wonder that U.K.
came last again this year? Do we hon-
estly care? At least it wasn’t yet another
humongous zero-point total for us
but nevertheless as human beings, we
seem to feel compelled to watch people
make total fools of themselves. Some
have said that Sir Terry Wogan is the
sole reason that they bother watching
this silly song competition because he
always gives witty commentaries when
introducing the various singers and
their country’s background, purpose-
fully livening up the dreadful singing
and awful dance moves on stage. For
those of you ‘keen’ on finding out who
swept to victory, I’ll tell you that it is the
hunky Russian, the one and only Dima
Bilan who sang ‘Believe.’ Thought so.
The name rings no bells and will never
ring a bell; neither now nor in the dis-
tant future, but apparently he is huge
in Russia. You see, some countries do
support, even love and adore, their acts
even if we don’t. It doesn’t matter one
bit at the end of the day, however, as
we’ve got plenty of musical fish in the
sea here...

O
ne Night Only are an
indie/rock/pop band
comprised of five
Hemsley, North York-
shire laddies in their
late teens/ early twenties. They formed
back in 2003 and have had recent suc-
cess with their singles ‘You and Me’
‘Just for Tonight,
’ and ‘It’s About Time.
’
Music Felix had the pleasure of talking
to Sam, the drummer and Jack the key-
boardist from the band.
You guys grew up in Yorkshire,
has that shaped your music in
any way?
J: I guess it just means that we are not
part of any city related scene, i.e., the
Arctic Monkeys are from Sheffield,
Maximo Park are from Newcastle
etc...
S: It has allowed us to create our own
style of music, we are not really influ-
enced by any local bands or what seems
to be cool at the time, so I think it has
affected the way we sound.
How did you guys get into music?
S: I got into music by listening to it. I’ve
always had music there around in the
house. My parents are very big on lis-
tening to music.
Were you self-taught or did you
have lessons?
J: I am a classically trained pianist. I’ve
been taught for years.
S: For me, I was self taught for 2 years,
had lessons for 2 years, loose and in-
formal ones, then I‘ve been self taught
since then.
Who is your favourite classical
composer?
J: It has to be Grieg.
What is your opinion on the Indie-
rock genre? In the past 5 years,
the music industry has been
flooded by so many bands that
come under this type of music.
Surely as listeners we have heard
enough of it?
S: I think it is too easy to pigeon-hole
someone as Indie-rock. If you look
at all the Indie bands, there’s a lot of
variation within them, like the Arctic
Monkeys, they are very different from
us. There is enough differences be-
tween the bands to not get bored of lis-
tening to them. Plus, Indie-rock does
kind of change with time so they don’t
all sound the same.
J: The brilliant thing about having
so many live bands around has made
music so much more prominent. Live
music is the main sort of thing at the
moment.
S: People go to gigs more than they buy
records these days.
Who writes the songs in the
band?
S: Everyone.
Doesn’t that generate a lot of
clashes between people, every-
one having various ideas and so
on?
S: Yes, but I think that is what brings
out the best in people. If you’ve got five
different musical inputs, five differ-
ent minds working on the same idea,
eventually you are going to get a better
sound out of it.
How do you determine when a
song is complete?
J: When we stop disagreeing.
How long did it take for you to
start and finish your album?
S: We wrote the collection of songs
over two years. Recording-wise, I think
it took us about four months, two or
three month blocks of recording.
How does it feel to be in a band?
J: The best thing is we are doing a job
with our best mates.
S: I don’t like doing anything by
myself.
J: Neither do I. Can’t stand it.
Even going to the loo?
S: I go to the toilet with Mark. We do
get compared to girls a lot, only with
the toilet thing.
J: It’s the tight jeans and the long hair.
Do you have a favourite venue
out of all the places you’ve played
at?
S: Dundee. Hot Sams. It’s a good venue.
The building is insane. It’s got three gig
venues in this same place.
J: I had a dream that there was a spa
there, behind this mirror because
we’ve been there once and I knew we
were going to go back there.
S: I think we’ve been there three times
and every-time we go there, we find
something that we didn’t know was
there before. The first time we went
there, we had ages before the sound-
checks, so we played hide and seek.
It must have been an hour and a half,
running around this place.
J: Mark disappeared. He was good at
hide and seek, he must have found a
corner and curled up there.
S: No, I think he left the building.
Do you get bored of playing the
same tracks, listening to the
same tunes over and over can get
tedious?
J: It’s not the same as listening to other
people’s music when you play your
own music, because having created it
ourselves, every time I play the songs, I
remember different things about when
we wrote it. People say, do you ever lis-
ten to your own music, well; of course,
I have it on my iPod. It is the best thing
we’ve ever made, two years of hard
work has been put in it.
How was it to support The Pigeon
Detectives and The Enemy?
J: Wicked. The Pigeons more so be-
cause we got to spend a longer time
with them, we got to know them very
well.
S: We only did five shows with the En-
emy. The Pigeons are really nice guys.
Is there any rivalry between you
and other bands?
J: We don’t make enemies, we are from
the North and we make friends with
everyone.
Since you’ve been in the music
business, have you learnt any
tricks of the trade, how to face
the media etc..?
S: Be natural.
J: And don’t bitch about other people
because they will publish it straight
off.

Bob Dylan and the Cure have
