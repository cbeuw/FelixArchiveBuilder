Dying on the inside or living hell
Depression is the most common mental health issue that students in UK universities suffer from, but it’s
often disregarded as a medical excuse. Sally Longstaff examines causes, symptoms and available treatments
W
hat life-threatening
disease do an
estimated 121
million people
worldwide
currently suffer from? At least one
in five adults will suffer from it in
their lifetime, and each year over two
million cases are diagnosed in the UK.
Women are diagnosed as suffering
from it twice as often as men. What is
this disease, often hidden away behind
layers of shame and casual attitudes
towards mental health? Depression.
Clinical Depression is a severe
psychiatric illness that a person has
for anything from a few weeks to a few
years. It can arise for no reason at all,
or it can be triggered by a very specific
event. Sometimes it can even be life-
threatening.
Symptoms vary from person to
person, and can be physical as well as
psychological. The length of suffering
varies: it can occur once in a lifetime
or there can be multiple recurrences;
it can appear either gradually or
suddenly; and can either last for a few
months or be a life-long disorder.
Over the course of these two pages,
we will examine what depression
actually is, look at its various
manifestations, how it can be treated,
and how someone can get help if
they think they are a sufferer of this
prevalent illness.
What are the main causes of depression?
T
here is no one cause of
depression and it varies
from person to person.
Sometimes there are obvi-
ous causes for depression,
such as bereavement, loss of a job or
physical illness, but often there are not.
Depression does not affect everyone
who has these life events. Some people
may be more at risk of depression than
others, but given the right circum-
stances, almost anyone may become
depressed. Often there is more than
one cause. The following factors can
cause depression:
Chemical Deficiencies
Symptoms of depression may be
caused by low levels of certain
chemicals in the brain. Between the
end of one nerve cell and the next
there is a small space called a syn-
apse. The nerve cells communicate
by releasing neurotransmitters into
the synapse, which then attach to
the other nerve cell and so pass on
the message. Three important neu-
rotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin
and noradrenaline are in short supply
in depression sufferers. The low levels
lead to faulty brain communication.
However it is not known whether
this is a cause or an effect of depres-
sion. Antidepressant drugs work
by increasing the levels of these
neurotransmitters.
Hormones
These may be important in
causing depression. Stress
hormones may be linked to
depression as the condition
is closely linked to stressful
experiences.
When a sufferer under-
goes a stressful event, a com-
plex series of hormones are
released which work together with
adrenaline to cause a feeling of fright
and anxiousness.
In most people, the hormone levels
return to normal once the stressful
situation has passed but in depres-
sion the system is hyperactive. Cortisol
(one of the hormones released) levels
don’t follow the normal pattern. Usu-
ally, cortisol is released in large quan-
tities in the morning and diminishing
amounts throughout the day. In de-
pressed people its release is the same
all day long.
Again, it’s not known whether this is
a cause or an effect of depression.
Genetics
There are many genes involved in de-
pression and no one knows how exact-
ly they work. There is no evidence of
straightforward inheritance for most
forms of depression. So, for example,
you will not definitely develop depres-
sion because a family member has it,
but your risk will be increased.
Personality
No single personality type predisposes
people to depression. However, those
who are obsessional, dogmatic and
rigid, and who hide their feelings or get
easily anxious may be more at risk.
Family Environment
Losing a parent in childhood, type of
parenting, physical or sexual abuse in
childhood may all predispose someone
to depression.
Stress and Life Events
Stress can lead to depression whether
it comes in the form of sudden, over-
whelming event or as long-term stress.
Depression is six times more
common in the six months
after a markedly stressful life
event.
The top ten stressful life
events are: death of a spouse,
divorce, marital separation, a
prison term, death of a close
friend, injury or illness, mar-
riage, losing a job, marital rec-
onciliation and retirement.
Psychological symptoms
of depression
Low Mood
Not everyone who has depression
feels low. Some are anxious or
emotionally numb, and some
experience a change in behaviour.
Low mood is more than just
feeling disappointed or fed up.
It’s a persistent feeling of sadness,
emptiness, loss and dread. With
severe depression, low mood can
sometimes be worse in the morning
and get a bit better during the
day. It can make it impossible to
enjoy anything and nothing brings
pleasure. With mild depression,
low mood can be worse in the
evenings and there may be good
days. Other people’s company may
bring pleasure although the sufferer
may feel low again when alone.
Low mood often induces crying,
sometimes at the slighted upset, or
for no reason at all.
Depressive Thinking
Depressive thinking has three
elements: negative thinking e.g. “I
am a failure”; high, unreasonable
expectations e.g. “I cannot be
happy unless everyone likes me”;
and mistakes in thinking, such as
jumping to negative conclusions,
focussing on negatives, coming
to conclusions on the bases of a
single incident and blaming yourself
for things that are not your fault.
These negative thinking patterns
undermine the sufferer, leading to
worry, low confidence and feelings
of worthlessness.
Anxiety
The hormone, adrenaline, is release
when we feel threatened, which
directs blood directed to muscles
and the brain so that we can fight or
flee. This makes us feel on edge and
tense, but the feeling usually passes
quickly if nothing happens. For a
depressed person, these feelings can
last for months, and dreading the
day ahead can lead to waking up
anxious.
Delusions
During severe depression, think-
ing can become so distorted that
the suffer loses touch with reality.
A delusion is a false belief which is
unshakable; for instance, that one
has divine powers, is a ghost, or can
see into the future.
Hallucinations
These involve perceiving things that
aren’t real, usually sounds, such as
voices, but can include seeing or
smelling things that aren’t there.
Concentration and
Memory Problems
Depression can be all-consuming,
and for some it can be difficult
to think about things outside
their illness. It can be difficult to
concentrate and so things can be
easily forgotten.
Physical symptoms
of depression
Suicidal Impulses
In the depths of depression, the past
looks full of mistakes, the present
is awful and the future is dreaded.
This leads some to conclude that
life isn’t worth living. Many people
with depression think about suicide,
but most do not go through with
it because of beliefs or the effect it
would have on their families.
Sleep Problems
These are common in depression
and are sometimes to blame for
tiredness that depressed people feel.
Sufferers may wake earlier and not
be able to sleep, or not able to drop
off at night, due to anxiousness.
Sometimes it’s a vicious circle: wor-
rying about not sleeping may lead to
even less sleep.
Mental and Physical
Slowing
Sufferers may feel tired all the
time, it’s hard to perform everyday
tasks, everything in an effort and
it can seem that things are slowed
down. Speech may be slow and
monotonous.
Self Harm
Self harm is deliberate injury
inflicted by a person upon their
own body. Self harmers are
commonly thought to be suicidal,
but more often than not, this
is not the case. Motives for self
injury are often personal and seem
incomprehensible to others. Those
who harm themselves often say that
it allows them to disassociate with
their feelings; the pain acts as a
release. Alternatively, self-harm can
be a release from feeling numb.
Loss of Appetite
Food doesn’t seems appetising. For
some hunger may even disappear.
