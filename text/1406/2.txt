NUS affiliation Question
Time debate: 12/06, 5:30pm
On Monday, Felix was handed a bunch of fliers from the Oxbridge
Editing company, offering to improve our writeing skils. The
company is part of The Oxbridge Research Group which also runs
controversial website OxbridgeEssays.com. The controversy arises
because students can pay to have their coursework edited by
‘professionals’. It’s even possible for students to buy entire essays if
they can afford to. What students do with the essays is up to them,
but it’s widely felt the companies are damaging the prospects of
honest students who work hard to write their own essays
NUS President, Wes Streeting, to face off against ICU President
The NUS (National Union of Students)
affiliation debate will move up a gear
next week, when the student media
holds a ‘Question Time’ style debate
with key figures from both campaign
teams.
NUS President, Wes Streeting, will
be in attendance trying to convince
students why ICU should remain af-
filiated with the institution. Imperial
College Union (ICU) President, Steve
Brown, has confirmed that he will also
be on the panel campaigning for dis-
affiliation from the NUS. They will
be joined by two more panellists, one
each from either side of the campaign-
ing spectrum. Felix Politics Editor and
Student Trustee, Kadhim Shubber,
will attempt his best David Dimbleby
impression by taking on the duty of
chairing the debate.
The debate is scheduled to take place
in the Upper Dining Hall (UDH) on
the first floor of the Union at 5:30pm
on Thursday 12th June. Those attend-
ing are advised to arrive 15 minutes
beforehand.
Imperial’s student news website
Live! (live.cgcu.net) will be teaming up
with student television society stoic
to make the discussion available to as
many people as possible – the event
will be broadcast online on Live! from
5:30pm onwards. The feed will also be
available to download afterwards, so
that students can weigh up the panel-
lists’ opinions to help inform how they
should vote in answer to the referen-
dum’s question: “Should Imperial Col-
lege Union remain affiliated with the
NUS?”
The debate is open to all students
to attend, but to ensure you get a seat
email editor@cgcu.net to reserve a
place. You can also give the panel a
grilling yourself by emailing questions
to the same address. If your question
is selected, you can voice it in person
on the night or have the Chair ask it
for you. You can direct them at either
side, or ask a general question of both
teams.
A few days after the debate, students
can expect to be harassed and bribed
around campus when campaigners
from both teams will be urging you to
vote in their favour.
Felix will be bringing you a plethora
of comment pieces in next week’s is-
sue, plus make sure to keep an eye on
live.cgcu.net/nus for regular updates
from NUS advocates and sceptics
alike.
Voting officially opens from 17th
to 23rd June. If you would like
to get involved in either team’s
campaign, contact the referen-
dum’s Returning Officer, Alistair
Cott, on dpcs@imperial.ac.uk.
If you would like to have your
opinion on the NUS heard,
contact either Felix or Live! on
comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk or
editor@cgcu.net respectively.
The debate is on: Thursday 12th June in the Upper Dining Hall on the first floor of the Union. Wes Streeting,
left, and Steve Brown will be on the panel. Pitch your questions to either team: email editor@cgcu.net
