epression is not simply
a state of feeling sad all
the time. This is a very
common misconception
of the illness, and in re-
ality, a sufferer’s level of depression is
very hard to define. The extent of de-
pression falls into one of three broad
categories:
Mild Depression
The low mood may come and go and
the illness starts after a specific stress-
ful life event. Anxiety may be present
too. Lifestyle changes may be enough
to lift this kind of depression.
Moderate Depression
Low mood is persistent and physical
symptoms are present too. Changes in
lifestyle are unlikely to work and medi-
cal help is needed.
Severe Depression
This is a life-threatening illness in
which symptoms are intense. Physical
symptoms as well as delusions and hal-
lucinations are present. Medical help is
urgently required.
Different names are also given for types
depression depending on symptoms:
Reactive Depression
This describes a depression that is
caused by a stressful event and doesn’t
usually last long. Counselling, family
support and practical steps may be all
that is required.
Endogenous Depression
This is depression that comes on for no
reason. It’s usually intense and physical
symptoms are more likely. It cannot be
treated without medical help.
Bipolar Disorder
Also known as manic depression.
There are sustained high moods and
sustained low moods which can range
from mild to severe depression. Dur-
ing highs sufferers feel elated, need
less sleep, have bags of energy, speak
quickly and can have delusions and
hallucinations.
These can be just as destructive as
the lows, due to reckless behaviour or
poor judgement.
Seasonal Affective Disorder
A specific type of depression that may
result from decreasing levels of day-
light as winter approaches and days
shorten.
How is depression treated and what options are available to sufferers?
F
or mild depression, there
are lots of self-help plans
that can be found online. It’s
worth seeing your GP even
if you want to use self-help
because they can offer independent,
objective advice.
Sometimes just taking a break when
you feel down can help you feel much
better. Talking things over with a friend
can help you feel better too. The open
acknowledgement of your problems
is often the starting point for working
out solutions.
Lifestyle changes, such as exercise,
can boost well-being and make you fit-
ter at the same time. Your GP can also
advise you on relaxation techniques.
Taking up a new hobby or activity
can keep you occupied and it breaks
the pattern of loneliness and sitting at
home worrying about problems.
Beyond self-help, there are three
main types of treatment available
for depression: psychological treat-
ment, drug treatment and physical
treatment.
Psychological therapies or conversa-
tional therapies are the most popular
type of treatment for depression. Get-
ting to the bottom of what causes de-
pression and talking about feelings is
the main idea. All psychological treat-
ments take a lot of time and commit-
ment and are not an easy option.
Brief therapies last up to six months
and usually consist of 4 to 20 weekly
sessions, of one hour each. They usu-
ally deal with problems in the present,
such as a relationship breakdown or
exam stress. Many brief therapies are
available on the NHS and your GP may
recommend one.
Longer term therapies usually con-
sist of more than 50 sessions, and are
often weekly or more than once week-
ly. These deal with the past and try to
discover why you are the way that you
are. Sufferers may be able to attend
long-term therapies on the NHS, but
waiting lists are long and they are defi-
nitely not a quick fix.
Counselling lasts for a vari-
able time, from one session
onwards. It doesn’t aim
to change deep rooted
problems or treat de-
pression, but it may get
rid of some of the problems
that are causing the
depression.
For some peo-
pledrugssuchas
antidepressants
can be a very ef-
fective treatment.
They work by increasing
the neurotransmitters in
the brain’s synapses and are
best for moderate and severe
depression. Anti-depressants are
not addictive but they are powerful
drugs that aim to lift your mood, rather
than to bring on a high.
They don’t eliminate
depression out-
right, instead
they are intended
to raise a sufferer’s
mood enough so
that they are well
enough to tackle
their depression with
other means, such
as self-help or
therapy.
There are
many different
types of antide-
pressants, and some
suit people better
than others. If your
GP recommends anti-
depressants then it’s im-
portant for you to make an
informed decision. Do some reading
When and how to get help, and where to search for it
I
f your low mood affects all parts
of your life, lasts for two weeks
or brings you to the point of
thinking about suicide, you
should seek help. Try to think
of depression as an illness that can be
treated. Ninety per cent of people with
depression can be treated by their GP,
who have years of experience of deal-
ing with it. Friends are also a great
source of comfort and help. If you
cannot talk to your GP, try to talk to a
trusted friend.
If you are thinking about suicide, you
are at risk of doing it. Get help urgent-
ly: see a GP, go to Accident or Emer-
gency Department, tell a friend or call
a helpline, such as the Samaritans. De-
pression can be treated.
If you know someone suffering from
depression, remember that it can be
very hard for them to approach you
when they are feeling bad. Try to en-
courage them to seek treatment from
professionals. Don’t blame them for
being depressed, they are probably
already blaming themselves. Reassure
them that lots can be done to help
them. Show that you care by listen-
ing sympathetically and spending
time with them. Encourage them to

How is depression classified?
Famous faces who’ve suffered from depression
talk about their feelings, but respect
their choices. It can be hard work and
frustrating, but also an opportunity
to build a closer and more satisfying
relationship.
and discuss it with your GP, especially
if you have concerns.
There is a lot of controversy at the
moment as a study by the University
of Hull has suggested that antidepres-
sants do not work, as they provide no
more benefit than a placebo. However,
this study did not test all antidepres-
sants and many people claim that they
have been helped by them.
The final treatment available, Elec-
troconvulsive Therapy (ECT), is a very
controversial method, but also one of
the most effective. 8 out of 10 people
find that it works quickly when prop-
erly prescribed.
ECT is offered to people who have
not responded to anti-depressants,
or are so severely depressed that they
are endangering their lives. Studies
have shown there to be no long term
brain problems, and whilst it can allow
patients to begin therapy, it does not
solve the causes of depression.
