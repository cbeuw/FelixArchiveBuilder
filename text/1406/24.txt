T
he Belgian festival
began life with one
stage hosting seven
bands and just three
thousand people on
a football pitch in 1985. From
humble beginnings to having
seen almost all major names in al-
ternative rock of the past twenty
years, the festival has been going
from strength to strength with a
burgeoning dance presence in the
last decade. This year of 2007 saw
The Smashing Pumpkins reunite
to headline almost all major sum-
mer festivals worldwide, making
their third appearance at Pukkel-
pop since 1993.
The main site of the Festival is
pretty huge, a lot of time, money
and effort has obviously gone into
not only the organization but also
the construction of the site. The
stages are huge and the tents are
enormous and boast sound qual-
ity you can only dream of expe-
riencing back home. The Dance
tent was the most awe inspiring
thing, as big as an actual club
back home in London and fully
fitted with screens at intervals
that dropped down along the ceil-
ing and the most incredible sca-
lectrix track of moving green LED
lights above you this was perfectly
designed and certainly the most
ubertastic dance tent I have ever
been in at a festival. The second
dance arena was almost as big, an
actual tent with funnelled tops
and an impressively and deco-
rated inside with enormous glass
baulbauls splattered with random
coloured paint markings and bal-
loons hanging form the top.
The attention given to the
dance areas clearly mimics the
popularity of dance music and I
have to admit it seemed if not the
most popular genre, as popular as
the rock music side of things. It
makes most British festivals look
like a muddy tent in someone’s
back garden by comparison.
Tickets are 150 Euros, and with
an almost identical lineup to
Reading (plus more), it’s worth it.

W
ild in the
Country is 18
hours of non-
stop music
and fun set in
the palatial grounds of Hertford-
shire’s Knebworth House. Starting
at 1pm on Saturday 5th July, this
one day festival is set across six
stunningly decorated marquee’d
arenas, and the addition, this year,
of a Live outdoor stage. The qual-
ity of music on offer provides the
perfect soundtrack, whilst the En-
chanted Wood, a Victorian Fun
Fair, Twisted Tea Rooms and a
giant chill-out tepee are just some
of the surprises in store at Wild in
the Country - a day and night of
great music, merry-making and
mischief.
Hot on the heels of her critically
acclaimed sold out UK tour, Wild
in the Country will be Bjork’s only
UK festival date this year. The
Icelandic songstress will bring
her unique and powerful theat-
rics to Knebworth. Tracks from
groundbreaking albums such as
Vespertine and Volta will be sure
to enthral all with her renowned
expressive performances - one
definitely not to be missed!
This years line-up reflects a di-
verse collection of artists and DJ’s,
with a mixture of live performanc-
es and DJ sets. This year will see
some exclusive performances, the
aforementioned Bjork, and also
the confirmed appearance of the
legendary Danny Tenaglia.
The range of DJs and live acts
will mean there is something to
suit everyone, and for festival
goers, a non-stop 18 hour musical
marathon.
The live performers playing
at this years festival are coming
from all over the globe to delight
the crowds at Wild in the Coun-
try. Iceland’s Bjork will be joined
by Belgium’s electro/rock outfit
Soulwax, Australia’s drum and
bass heroes Pendulum, Battles and
Hercules & Love Affair from the
States, as well as a good meaure of
UK acts. It’s at Knebworth Park,
and if it tickles your fancy - con-
tact us and well give you a ticket.

WIN TICKETS!

UK: 5th August
We’ve got 2 pairs of tickets
Wild In The Country to give
away to our readers, just
email in to nightlife.felix@

to bother to talk about Glastonbury because it has
gotten far too big for its Wellingtons in our humble
opinion, and besides if you didn’t begin to register 5
months ago you know very well you’re not going to
be there.
Belgium is fast becoming a real haven for music
festival lovers and if you haven’t been to a festival
in Europe before then go now and expand your
mind to the possibilities of living without hype
and the need to get so mindlessly drunk you can’t
remember who played what or when anyway.
By far the most provincial is Dour. This is it’s 20th
year and it promises to be a party. Rock Wercher’s
line-up kicks ass and Pukkelpop is Reading set in
more space and with stages you can feasibly be
at the front of for every band without even trying.
Plus European festivals have bands during the day
and then DJ’s long into the night making for a much
harder party experience.
We at Felix love you, and because of our inherent
omnipotent benevolence, we have tickets to a fair
selection of these very festivals to give away. Just
send in your name and details and a reason why
we should give our love to you in particular and we
shall bestow our gifts upon those most.
