The winner of Slitherlink 1,405 was
Hringur Gretarsson yet again! Hold
on, that’s actually not true. No one
actually entered this week! Please
enter. My life isn’t worth living oth-
erwise. We’ll give a prize out in the
summer.
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is simi-
lar to Minesweeper mixed with a
dash of Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slith-
erlink grid is by drawing crosses
around any zeros. Drawing crosses
is purely done to so that you know
where there can’t possibly be a line.
So, take the pattern below as an ex-
ample. Begin by drawing crosses,
then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in
the following directions:

Official congratulations to Alexander
Mettrick, and unofficial congratula-
tions to the various Felix members of
staff who came up with the right an-
swers. If the Sports Editor can do it,
people, so can you.
Good luck this week; a busy schedule
means that some of the clues may be
a little looser than I would otherwise
prefer. Enjoy.
