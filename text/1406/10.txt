There. It’s final.
I’m going. I’m so ex-
cited I really can’t fall
asleep. I can’t even lie still. I’m really
going – alone. I can’t take anyone – I
can’t even tell anyone – they’d all just
try to dissuade me.
‘It’s too dangerous’, ‘you don’t know
what could be out there’. The same
feeble warnings from people I used
to respect. Can’t they see how mind-
numbingly fascinating the unknown
is? I despise this pathetic routine we’ve
settled into. Same boring schedule.
Same boring people. There must be
more to life than the Skempton Build-
ing and the Civil Engineering Depart-
ment. There must be. And I’m going to
find it.
I leave tomorrow. Across the Queen’s
Lawn to the Sherfield Building – my
adrenaline is incandescing as I write
those magic words. Sherfield Build-
ing. Sherfield Building. The very act of
setting them down on paper is enough
to give me a rush unlike any I ever got
from cocaine.
The Sherfield Building. The last
known bastion of civilization. And
then, then! Out into the great un-
known. To the banks of the Great Sher-
field Walkway; let it carry me where it
will. My bags are packed, my equip-
ment is in working order; everything’s
ready. I really must force myself to get
some sleep.
I leave at dawn.

Left at dawn. Was unable to get through
the Sherfield gates till a quarter to ten.
Spent four miserable hours shivering
in the rain, attempting to find shelter
under the forbidding presence of the
Queen’s Tower. A disappointing start.
Am currently warming myself in the
Sherfield building, trying to strike
up conversations with the seasoned
travellers around me. One shrivelled

Held hostage by Facebook
B
ebo, Faceparty, Facebook,
Myspace, Myface: social
networking seems to be the
thing we do best nowadays.
Rewind ten years and the
dark world of chat rooms was still very
much taboo and treated as unsafe and
slightly seedy. However, with our ever-
growing dependence on technology we
have overcome this reticence and are
now embracing it whole heartedly.
My first, brief experiences with on-
line ‘networking’ began through AOL
online chat where chat rooms are
themed, aimed towards particular in-
terests and pursuits. People were only
identifiable by their screen name and a
very limited profile covering ‘a/s/l’ and
perhaps a few details of other hobbies.
On the one hand the risk of assum-
ing a false identity was made easier,
although the absence of pictures and
information regarding friends, family
and associates made it slightly harder
for you to be tracked down. Facebook
profiles are a stalker’s dream come
true: addresses and phone number
are accessible (if the user chooses to
divulge such information) but for the
most part ‘facebookers’ exercise cau-
tion in what they choose to share and
privacy options.
What worries me is the apparent
time that teenagers spend on social-
ising silently and alone. On a recent
chat show involving 15-18 year olds, it
seemed that the time spent online was
a daily average of 5 hours! It is no won-
der this government is in an uphill bat-
tle against obesity and heart disease.
Apart from the obvious detriment to
one’s health if such a large portion of
the day is spent sedentary, I find that
after even a few hours of looking at a
computer screen my eyes are strained
and I am left with a headache.
The young people interviewed pro-
tested that it was for lack of anything
better to do that they resorted to hours
mesmerised by the comings and go-
ings of their peers. The drinking age of
18 stops them spending those valuable
hours in the park after dark damag-
ing their livers instead and so the In-
ternet is required. Who raised these
unimaginative children? What about
the wealth of authors, poets, artists to
which we have free access in museums
and libraries? How about a walk along
the South Bank, in Hamsptead Heath
or a boogie in your bedroom with iPod
blasting if the thought of actual human
contact has you breaking out a sweat.
Another thing I despair for is the
calibre of grammar and general use of
the English language adopted by many
online, not all of them without basic
G.C.S.E. English. Unless you have
learned the incorrect spelling of words
(“sez”, “skool”, “’avin’”) surely it is easier
to use the correct spelling rather than
take those extra few seconds to work
out how they are spelled phonetically?
Some of the spellings do not even min-
imise the number of times the fingers
need to come into contact with the
keyboard (“choon” for example). How-
ever, we live in a society of freedom of
speech (for now) and so people must
be able to spell as they wish.
Back to the subject in hand: Face-
book. I use this example, as it is the
only site I am held hostage by. My feel-
ings towards my captor are mixed, per-
haps even edging towards Stockholm
syndrome. I hate the fact my heart
leaps when I see I have 3 new notifi-
cations and maybe even a message or
two. A little sad, perhaps, but I use it
solely for entertainment value and ease
of communication rather than looking
for new friends and my total daily use
is never more than one hour. It means
I do not have to take pictures anymore:
I rely on my more camera-savvy friends
to post theirs up and I can browse hap-
pily (or ashamedly, as last night’s mem-
ories come back).
The army of communication modes
at our disposal has certainly compli-
cated human relationships and dy-
namics immensely. Text messages,
emails and msn conversations are read
into; the lack of a response is hailed as
a bad omen, as is the speed of a reply.
One person I knew took offense to
the number of kisses I left at the end
of text! The characters of Jane Austen
novels were spared so much daily ten-
sion, quite content with hearing from
their loved one, by letter, monthly.
Today, the removal of someone’s rela-
tionship status can cause jubilation or
heartache for those involved.
One thing Facebook will prove use-
ful for in the future is the analysis of
societies, examining theories such as
the 6 degrees of freedom: a sociolo-
gist’s dream come true. But for now
they comfort, amuse, irritate, expose,
waste time and lower grades. But will
these social networking sites fade out
like mini disks or are they here forever
more?
fourth year with a mad glint in his eye
claims to have made it to the other end
of the Walkway more often than seems
possible, and has offered his services to
escort me safely to the Terra Incognita
on the other side. Have accepted. Will
brave the Walkway with Bipolar Jim
later this morning.
13:20
Where on Earth am I? Have been walk-
ing round for what seems like forever,
and seem to be slowly but surely re-
tracing my steps. I may not have much
exploring experience, but I can say,
with absolute certitude, that I am quite
definitely lost.
Reached the other end of the Walk-
way intact – no thanks to Bipolar Jim.
His directional senses are worse than
useless – the ignorance field that ema-
nates from him plays havoc with all
navigational devices. My compass has
still not recovered from the shock.
I dispensed with his services as soon
as was possible, and, with rising trepi-
dation, left the Walkway. The part of
the College I am now in is illegibly
marked on my map with faint pencil.
As best as I can make out, this must be
Hoxteth. Or Huxley. Whichever it is,
the natives are not friendly.
This seems to be an almost exclu-
sively male society, and as a result the
indigenous culture is quite clearly go-
ing to seed. Gaunt men wielding far
more notebooks than they could pos-
sibly use roam the endless halls inces-
santly. My attempt to pass unnoticed in
their midst is so far paying off, though I
still have no idea where I am.
15:30
This infernal building is like a rabbit
warren. Will attempt to head north.
Compass still proving unhelpful.
19:00
Have made progress! Reached territo-
ry as yet unmarked on my map. Can’t
believe I’m the first civilised man to
set foot in this remote land! It seems
dauntingly large and quite impenetra-
ble, and may be easier to explore to-
morrow. Will spend the night in this
empty bathroom cubicle – who said
the terrain was inhospitable?
March 16th
18:20
Three frantically exciting days. Was
almost spotted by native search party
and had to make a quick escape. Potted
plant in foyer provided excellent cover
till yesterday, when I was forced to fend
for myself in the great outdoors.
This place is worse than Hoxteth –
it appears to be entirely constructed
of doors. Leading, needless to say,
nowhere. Who needs so many doors?
Why are they there? To keep people in?
Or out? So many questions…
My supplies of marmite and chut-
ney are running low, and I may need
to forage for food soon. Careful study
of inhabitants reveals, surprisingly, a
humanoid race, capable of a semi-ar-
ticulate form of language as yet incom-
prehensible to me.
Cautious exploration finds me re-
peatedly coming face-to-face with
idolatrous statues of some local deity.
Inscription around base, on close in-
spection, seems to read ‘Blackett’. In
tribute to the cultural beliefs in this
part of the world, have decided to
name this mountainous area on the
map and the surrounding lowlands as
Blackett Mountain.
Important to show respect for these
primitive people. They like that.
18:45
Almost out of marmite.
March 20th
15:30
Last agonising drops of marmite fin-
ished last night, and was finally forced
to go looking for nourishment.
Strange regional fauna seems capa-
ble of distributing plastic-like food if
shaken hard enough. Small squares of a
sweet, brown substance kept me going
during this morning’s exploration.
My first conclusions about this
mysterious land are overwhelmingly
positive. The top of Mount Blackett
provides a stunning view of the sur-
rounding wilderness. Had an almost
spiritual moment watching the sun rise
over the vast rainforest to the East. The
airhereisconducivetodeep,prolonged
thought – my short-lived acquaintance
with the natives reveals hidden depths,
though an unhealthy obsession with
dragon balls and unnecessarily power-
ful lasers seems to be prevalent.
April 1st
15:30
Have found my true spiritual resting-
place. This is where I belong. Here,
among people whose intellect I can re-
spect and whose interests I can relate
to. At last. A real science.
