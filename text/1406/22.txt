Gig review
Pendulum
Brixton Academy
Pendulum’s immense gravitional pull at Brixton
influenced your music, so what
do you think are the key ingredi-
ents for making people like them
the success that they were and
still are?
S: They were doing something differ-
ent at the time, they are all very unique
sounds. They’ve touched a lot of peo-
ple with their music.
Apart from yourselves, who do
you think people should take
notice of in the music business at
the moment?
S: The Wall Birds who are our sup-
ports. They are a great folky/rocky
three piece. They’ve supported the Pi-
geons before as well.
What are your opinions on people
like Britney and Pete Doherty?
S: Bit of a waste I suppose. Pete Doher-
ty with all that talent, no need to mess
it up like that. Britney, she has gone
mad. She’s gone.
J: She’s insane, gone doolali. Pete’s an
amazing talent. It’s a real shame.
What about Amy Winehouse?
S: She’s got a great voice. She might
sort herself out. Out of the three peo-
ple, she is probably the one most likely
to sort herself out. I think she is close
to passing the point where she won’t be
able to recover, but who knows.
J: I do like her. I believe that she is ca-
pable of sorting herself out. You can
hope.
Have you ever been pressurised
to take drugs?
J: No. You just simply say no.
Do you get recognised when you
go out?
S: Not overly. Sometimes in smaller
towns. I don’t really mind being recog-
nised. I wouldn’t want it to go to far.
Being stalked, that would be weird.
J: George does a bit. It’s when we are at
gigs, we do.
Do you ever read your fan-mails?
S: We don’t really get that much, but
we get stuff handed to us at gigs and
signings.
J: We do read them and eat the
chocolates/sweets.
Name favourite musicians of all
time.
S: There are a lot of amazing musi-
cians. Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones,
Guns and Roses, The Cure etc… Mod-
ern bands: there’s Arcade Fire and The
Killers.
Do you ever have time to watch
TV nowadays?
J: We rarely ever get to a place where
we can get a TV signal. It is hard to get
TV signal when the tour bus is mov-
ing. But SkyPlus is a beautiful thing.
Lost is amazing. I used to watch the
OC. I’ve watched Skins; about 4 shows.
Big Brother. I’m quite ashamed of lik-
ing Big Brother now, but it is good.
S: I haven’t seen Eastenders for about 2
months. I miss it.
Would you ever go on Big
Brother?
J: Hell yeah. I would love to go on it.
S: You’d get messed up in there.
Have you ever been to any show-
biz parties?
S: We went to the Brits this year, No
gossip. We met people like Rhianna
and the Kaiser Chiefs. Nice to meet but
it’s not really a big deal when you meet
another musician.
J: We got really, really drunk. All the
booze was free. And it’s just danger-
ous. Champagne. Anything you want.
Do you think music videos are im-
portant to the package of a band?
S: Yes, a band with a good video would
definitely go further than a band with a
rubbish one.
J: That treadmill video. People will
remember that video forever, it is
legendary.
S: But they’ve got the music behind it
to back it up. It’s not just the video that
makes it work.
If you could choose any location
to shoot a video, where would
you choose?
J: Sam’s house. It’s in a massive valley
and there’s a huge abbey over the other
side of the river. It would be epic. If it
was all lit up at night, it would look
insane.
S: Nice big river, a big field, national
heritage.
Have you ever done anything
crazy on stage?
S: We are all very energetic on stage.
George like doing big guitar swings.
J: I decked myself in front of five thou-
sand people at Brixton Academy. It felt
weird trying to stand up again. Our
bass player is the most mental one out
of all of us.
Will we be seeing a second album
coming out sometime in the
future?
J: We are hoping to make one maybe in
a year’s time.
S: That’s what we are hoping, maybe
next summer. What’s going to come
out will come out. Let’s wait and see.
These kick-ass, drum’n’bass Aussies
who dabble with rock/electronica,
have certainly tasted a lot of success
since the release of their debut album-
Hold Your Colour back in 2005. Their
new album, In Silico, stormed into the
album charts at number two; they are
simply on fire, oozing sheer confidence
from all corners. Their soaring music
has the inherent power to rip the dance
floor apart leaving perennial reper-
cussions wherever and whenever it is
played.
Pendulum knew exactly how to get
thousands of us up and raving at the
Academy. The band were plainly in
their element, high on something for
sure. They delivered the show with in-
credible pumping sonic soundscapes,
the whole time, each one of the pro-
tagonists unmistakably immersed in
the zone. Some have likened Pendulum
to a modern-day Prodigy, the band is
comprised of Rob Swire (vocals/synth/
producer), two guitarists, a DJ, drum-
mer and an Mc who mixes the beats to
perfection. A clan of many talents.
Getting towards midnight, the rav-
ings began, the fireworks were ignited
with the onset of a laser show, a frenzy
offlashingcoloursonstageinitiatedthe
incredible buzz that pulsated through
the crowd as Pendulum took to the
stage. It was electric, the crowd going
totally beserk, a heavy contrast to the
somewhat lukewarm responses exhib-
ited towards the previous two DJ sets.
The lure of the coquettish rumbling
bass seemingly galvanized the fans
into action, everyone either punching
the air with glow sticks, shouting or
screaming frantically, before the coolly
composed quintet appeared from a
mist of dry ice. Pendulum; they know
how to play it cool.
The band enlightened us with a mix-
ture of both their old and new material.
Of note, the slinky old number ‘Fasten
Your Seatbelt’, the mesmerizing ‘Hold
Your Colour’ and the uber-racy ‘An-
other Planet’ were huge crowd pleas-
ers. ‘Propane Nightmares’, their last
top-ten colossal radio hit explicitly
demonstrates Pendulum’s progression
musically. Vocalist Swire’s bold into-
nations cross with orchestral rock,
before crescendoing into their trade-
mark stomping drum’n’bass mayhem.
What more could you possibly want?
‘Mutiny’ offered a punky feisty edge
whilst ‘Blood Sugar’ blew the place to
shreds with its phenomenal symphon-
ic aggression and energy. The dramatic
soundscapes engineered by Pendulum
were a stunning combination of gravi-
tational thudding beats along with
heavy yet suave bass-lines held togeth-
er by trance-like leads. Irresistible to
adolescents and grown-ups needing a
strong dose of cataclysmic mash-up.
I have no doubt that this epic quintet
will continue to orchestrate cyclones in
the festival season ahead, having mas-
tered an unforgettable live presence of
their own.

Pendulum: pretty in pink
Glowing in green
Paying these guys to smile almost worked
