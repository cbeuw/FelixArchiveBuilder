What’s happening to union council?
Grace Rahman
Editor-in-Chief
A
t this week’s union
council a paper was
tabled... on the problems
faced by union council.
Only two meetings so far this
academic year have been quorate,
rendering the democratic outlet for
students ultimately useless.
The paper, entitled ‘Solving
Council’s Quorum Crisis’, proposed
to discount members from quorum
who continually did not show up
to meetings, and allow them to
discount themselves in writing.
These measures would involve a
change to the bye-laws of the union.
The meeting, which was quorate,
voted in favour of the measures, in a
majority of 54%. However, changes
to the bye-laws or constitution of
the union need a so-called ‘super-
majority’ of 66%, so it did not pass.
Had it passed, the bye-law-
changing paper would have had
to be okayed by the union’s trustee
board (where voting is by ‘consensus’
rather than actual voting and
includes union management as
well as officer trustees). It would
then have to be sanctioned by
the Imperial College Council to
become ‘union law’.
Although the paper did not
pass, the majority of those present
did agree with the sentiment, so a
working group will be set up to work
towards improving the situation.
Council is the first port of call for
anyone who thinks the union should
take a stand on a particular subject,
whether that be pro-Junior Doctors
or anti-Prevent. Technically it
is where the union’s policies are
decided by students, but arguably
the main big decisions are made
by union employees at the trustee
board level.
Anyone can attend council, but
only elected individuals can vote
for or against the papers presented.
There are representatives from each
department, lay members and the
executive group chairs also get a
vote.

seen votes of no confidence against
sabbatical officers, and one vote
where the union decided it was in
favour of the government’s raising
of tuition fees.
Often dismissed as the playground
of union “hacks”, council has an
unpleasant reputation for being a
slightly unruly meeting of people
who would rather argue over points
of the constitution than vote about
the issues faced by students.

In terms of access, there will be
two “accessible” rooms, but the
buildings still have no lifts.
In a dramatic U-turn on housing
policy, at the end of last summer
Imperial announced that Fisher
hall would be reopened for the year
as the college had let in too many
undergraduates to fulfil its promise
of providing accommodation to
every first year.
Imperial offered up rooms in
Fisher to freshers, and indeed any
student that applied, for £132 per
week. The halls are not in good
shape.
Hall seniors were initially poached
by the accommodation department
from their preferred halls without
their consent to join the wardening
team in Fisher, before being
returned after protest.
This will be the first time halls
solely for the returning non-fresher
undergraduates will be available.
The Imperial accommodation
website says the new halls will offer
a “sense of familiarity but with more
independence than the first year
experience”.
Applications for the new halls are
expected to open later this month.
B
y the time you’re reading
this, unless you’re uber
keen on Friday morning,
it’s likely that the
Imperial College Union Leadership
Elections booths have closed for
another year.
At noon today, two weeks of
campaigning, lecture shout-outs
and most importantly, free food,
will come to a close, with the final
results for the main positions being
announced in a swanky event at
Metric (possibly an oxymoron) later
this evening.
Over the course of the last 7
days, as FELIX went to press, over
113,000 votes had been cast by over
6500 voters on positions within
clubs and societies,departments and
most importantly on the Sabbatical
positions within the Union (except
DPFS, which had no nominees this
year).
This equates to a 37% turnout, a
number lower than most UK general
elections (2001 was the lowest at
59.4%) but this meant that Imperial
has the fourth highest participation
of university elections.
Notable voting stats included the
18 and under age group taking the
highest turnout so far (66%), with
every subsequent age group having
a smaller percentage of voters than
the one younger than it. RSM
Hockey and Badminton are also the
only clubs or societies with a 100%
participation rate.
At the time of writing, Electrical
Engineering, Earth Science
Engineering and Co-Curricular
Studies featured in the top three
participating departments.
If you haven’t voted and are
reading this before voting closes, go
and vote now at vote.union.ic.ac.uk.
You could make all the difference,
and it is your university after all.
Keep your eyes peeled for all of the
latest developments in the election
results on the FELIX website on
Friday night. I can hardly contain
my excitement.
