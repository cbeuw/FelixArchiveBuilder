nternational Women’s Week!
Elections! We’ve got a corker
of a newspaper for you this
week, if I do say so myself.
Here at FELIX,we’ve always been
trans-inclusive radical feminists, so
if you missed the very interesting
talk from Anjeli Patel held a few
weeks ago at Imperial to celebrate
LGBT History Month, we have an
exclusive interview with her on page
eight. Arts takes a look at fabulous
women artists this week, and we
also interviewed some real Imperial
females, delving into the issues they
face and asking the questions you
won’t see addressed at the Women@
Imperial PR gatherings (assuming
you were invited, of course).
By the time you’re bored enough
to read this, it’s probably past
Friday evening, and the results of
the Union’s Rather Large Elections
2016 have been announced to a
handful of tipsy careerists in Metric,
who will now go on to form the next
incarnation of the Beit Quad Cartel.
Well, from the self-appointed cool
sabb of this generation (sorry Med)
I will pass on this humble advice.
Always be charming and try not

to be a dick. Unless you've been
wronged of course, then go wild.
Learn what off the record means.
Get a power pack. Go to all the
protests. Talk to the FELIX Editor
(not on a Thursday though). Be nice
to the FELIX Editor and buy them
drinks when they looked worried on
a Tuesday. Talk to the students. Be
nice to the students. Don’t listen to
the comments (but do read them in
case they're libelous).Tell your team
not to screenshot when people say
rude things about you but remind
them that you like to be informed
that you have a group of die-hard
fans in second year Biomed. Keep
all the doors open. Don’t let anyone
tell you you can’t stand a sentence
with 'and' – you can do as you
damn please. Stay in your office. Be
accountable.Take your meds. Drink
water. Call your mum. Dassit!
And it was International Women’s
Day this week, so I have extra
advice for the lucky lady sabbs. I
am sad that no women, especially
no WOCs ran for FELIX Editor
this year, but there are certainly
plenty of promising lady writers for
the future of FELIX. Lady sabbs,

In response to 'Meet the
Candidates broadcast live with
nine Presidents', Issue 1629
Dear Madam Editor,
I'm sorry if this isn't the right
address – I didn't want to email
some poor fresher called FELIX
who's by now had enough and will
probably one day resort to editing
The Tab (I miss you, Matt Allinson
– and second year,when I was young
and carefree).
BUT (on the off chance I'm
emailing the correct address) I'd like
to complain about this years "Meet
The Candidates" hustings part of
the "Leadership Elections" (RIP
"Big Elections", you'll be missed).
I spent my (very happy) UG years
here at Imperial, and loved the Big
Elections and the camaraderie (and
rivalry!) they inspired. Now I'm a
PG I sat down to watch Meet The
Candidates (they're all so young!
What cuties!) before I cast my vote,
and was unpleasantly surprised. I
can forgive pauses (though why the
hell should *I* skip to 15 minutes
in to escape the worm on doom on
a yellow background – just delete
that part! – I genuinely thought my
(IC-provided) laptop volume was
broken for a few minutes!).Skipping
through this, the stream, even after
the fact, was so out-of-sync (video-
versus-sound), poor-quality, and
jumpy, as to be unwatchable! It's
like the union didn't *want* people
to watch these hustings – IC Radio
is usually very good, and the hiccups
could easily have been erased/edited
before uploading to YouTube or at
least addressed in the preamble and
the presidential candidates given
the chance to speak without this
distraction. This failure makes it
very hard to decide who (given as a
PG I have no direct dealings with
any of the candidates) to vote for.
It feels a bit like you don't *want*
us to watch Meet The Candidates
(especially given the 15 minute
wait for any action, even the in the
"finished" version). The lifestyle of
PG students is very much different
that that of UGs: we don't get the
lecture shout-outs nor the presence
of our U/G peers (and by the same
token, we don't want that) – but we
(I) feel left out this year, compared
to how I felt before. And that's not
OK – indeed: that's not the ICU I
know and love – so (winner winnner
chicken dinner) remember your
PGs and that we, too, love ICU.
Peace and love,
Anonymous
Where for art thou Matt
Allinson? Encouraging the union
with love and open arms, maybe I
let me tell you, you’re about to be
flung into a management position,
and people don’t like being told
what to do. Don’t let a man explain
feminism to you. Don’t let a white
dude tell you what's racist.Point out
these things, because well-meaning
people often don’t know they’re
doing it. Solidarity is key. We’ve got
to lift each other up or we won’t get
anywhere.
Man, what an editorial, and what
a week. Peace!
should try that.

In response to 'The Rent
Guarantor Trap', Issue 1629
Dear Madame Editor,
I enjoyed reading Peter Munton’s
article The Rent Guarantor Trap in
last week’s FELIX. I thought now
would be a good time to point out
that this is something I’ve been
working on in my role as Deputy
President (Welfare) since August.
I’ve taken the idea to very high
levels in the College and it’s been
met with nothing but support.
I’m currently working closely
with various managers in the
College to finalise the details of
a proposal informed by students,
elected officers, Union Council and
schemes currently in place at other
universities.
I’d hate to jinx it by speaking
too optimistically, but I honestly
believe the scheme will be piloted
over the coming years. Given that
some of the candidates running for
sabbatical positions have discussed
the potential scheme with me and
pledged to continue supporting the
idea in their manifestos, I think
there’s also a good chance that when
I leave the Union in August that
work in this area will continue.
All the best
Jennie Watson
Deputy President (Welfare)
Looks like Nas lost a vote there!
We knew what you were doing
there, Peter. Other candidates are
available. Wait, can I stop saying
that now?
-Ed.
