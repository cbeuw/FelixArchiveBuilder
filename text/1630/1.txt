Renovated Evelyn Gardens halls will cost
up to £225 per week
Basketball team told by Ethos
they’re not a “commercial asset”
Their slots had already been cancelled twice in three
months without notice
L
ast weekend Imperial’s
1st
Basketball team were
told as they arrived for
a tournament they had
organised that their court booking
had been given away to a birthday
party.
The group had spent hours
organising the tournament, that
involved multiple matches, teams
and referees. The tickets cost £4
online and £5 on the door and when
people started turning up at midday,
they were turned away by Ethos
staff.
The students were told that
they simply weren’t as much “of

Gardens, Holbein,
Southwell and Willis
Jackson, which college
closed at the end of last year, will
reopen this September to second
and third year undergraduates only.
Standard singles will range
from £182 to £200 per week, in
comparison to Beit’s £192. Ensuite
singles range from £190 to £225
compared with the £216 for the
same in Beit.
The accommodation will also
operate on a 51 week contract,
whilst all other halls offer first years
only 38 weeks’ housing.
There will be no wardening
facilities – a feature college has
wanted to get rid of for a while,
as the wardens and subwardens
pay no rent, although arguably
provide important welfare services.
Hall seniors pay full rent, but their
existence reduces the number of
rooms available for freshers.
The new halls will boast a 24 hour
reception and “concierge service”.
The accommodation website
also mentions onsite “Resident
Assistants”, the nature of which is
unclear.
