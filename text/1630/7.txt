“I’d say I lost 90% of my friends circle
when I said that I was going to transition”
I
am ten minutes late by the
time I get on the line to Anjeli
Patel – not something I reckon
would be taken lightly at Ernst
& Young LLP, where she works as
an associate in assurance within
Wealth and Asset management.
Ms Patel was a guest speaker
during Imperial’s LGBT+ week,
and FELIX took the oppotunity to
interview her about her experiences
as a trans British Asian woman
working in the finance industry.
FELIX: So, I’m not Asian or
trans. I know a fair few people at
IC who are LGBT+ and have an
Asian background. Normally, the
first response I got was “Don’t put
my name on that!”What would you
about this?
Anjeli Patel: As a community we
need to be a lot more visible. There
are some situations where we just
have to be able to talk about this
publicly. Unless we do that, we
aren’t going to progress society any
further.
One of the root causes of Indian
culture still having such a stigma
towards LGBT+ people is due to
the way that a lot of families bring
up their children. You’re told you’re
meant to go to university, get a great
job, end up getting married – that’s
the template life, and everyone
should fit into that template life. It’s
almost a situation where you fit the
model, or you don’t fit in at all.
FELIX: Does coming from a
British-Asian family make that
harder?
AJ: Definitely. Much of the
Indian community struggled when
they first came over to the UK.They
worked hard. They worked really
hard to emerge and be successful
– and they want to continue that
success. I think there’s an imbalance
between wanting your children
to be successful, but at the same
time, not really allowing them to
develop and be their own person.
That’s even in a marriage situation
– whereby if an Indian person
marries outside of their community,
outside of a specific caste, or even a
specific religion, a situation arises
where they almost need to seek the
permission of those around them.
Rather than appreciating it as two
people being in love, it can initially
be seen as a challenge by certain
members of Indian society.
FELIX: On the other hand,
people say: “Right – we’ve got gay
marriage. We’ve got equal rights in
law. Why are we still talking about
this?”
AJ: I think, to be honest with you
that the idea of being reluctant to
discuss issues stems from shame.
That whole idea of brushing it under
the carpet stems from shame. You
don’t want to talk about the issue:
“It doesn’t happen in our backyard
– it happens elsewhere”. People still
think it doesn’t happen in Asian
society. They think it has to do
with upbringing, that it’s a ‘western
thing’. A lot of Asian people say
“we haven’t brought our children up
to do that, so it’ll be fine.” There’s
this wall of ignorance around the
whole topic. Being LGBT+ has
nothing to do with upbringing or
background or social status or class
– it’s got everything to do with the
individual. Until people understand
that, we have to keep going.
FELIX: But you’d still identify
strongly as Indian?
AJ: I do. I think, overall, our
culture is great and I am proud to be
Indian. We have great literature, we
have great cinema, great food. We
have a lot to be proud of, and I very
strongly identify as Hindu.
FELIX: Sure, the Rigveda
says “Vikruti Evam Prakriti” –
”Perversity/diversity is what nature
is all about; what seems un-natural
is also natural”. Why was that
attitude lost?
AJ: Personally, I’m just not sure
if Indian society was ever widely
accepting of LGBT+ people.
Many very modern texts are also
supportive, but they just aren’t lived
up to. A lot of the stereotypical
ideas about what it means to be an
Indian person aren’t linked with
our faith, they’re not linked with
our history – they’re behaviours
that have been developed since
we arrived here in the UK. It’s our
religion that preaches tolerance,
acceptance and love. It’s our culture
that has distorted itself, through
greed, continually seeking material
gain and being overly concerned
about what others think of us.
FELIX: What does it mean to be
female to you?
AJ: It bears no relation with
sexuality and is so difficult to
articulate. It’s the way I feel in
terms of the things that I associate
that are feminine. It’s being the one
who nurtures relationships slightly
more...The traditional stereotypes of
what it is to be female are something
that I’ve always found attractive.
Even if it’s just enjoying certain
aspects of makeup, fashion, hair,
I’ve always had interests that align
me more to what is ‘stereotypically’
female. I’ve always felt, intrinsically,
inside, that I’m female, even prior to
any surgery.
FELIX: But, say I know guys who
wear makeup or are into fashion –
does that make them, necessarily,
feminine?
AJ: It’s so,so much more than that,
though I completely understand
that men can be into fashion
or wear make-up. I was never
comfortable... I could never walk
into a room dressed as a male before
I transitioned and feel comfortable.
I would always just want to be in the
side of the room, not being noticed,
hope no-one would even speak to
me.If I reverse the question and ask,
other than the fact that you were
assigned male at birth, how do you
know you’re male? ; It’s a feeling so
mentally present but so difficult to
capture into words.
FELIX: A number of LGBT+
international students have told
FELIX they fear that if they come
out, their family will cut them off
financially, and they will lose their
education. What’s your view on
this?
AJ: We have to break this cycle
whereby a large proportion of
LGBT+ people end up not being
able to have a great education for
financial reasons. Ideally, Imperial
should have some kind of system
where they have grants for people
who are in this situation (Though,
you would need to be careful that
those aren’t abused).
You need
to change
the culture,
not just the
rules or the
people
FELIX: But should trans people
stay as part of LGBT community?
Stonewall has only just agreed that
it will campaign for trans rights. If
someone says “I’m a straight woman
now, I don’t need this”, is that right?
AJ: I completely accept that
opinon.I understand that Stonewall
only recently decided to work with
trans people, to help trans people,
but for me it’s a sign of progression.
The timing is unfortunate – and yes,
it is late in the day. But we are very
slim on options, to be honest, and
I feel that isolating overselves in an
already isolated environment isn’t
sensible. Stonewall is doing great
work right now, and going at it
alone with so few public, visible role
models – we’d be doing ourselves a
huge disservice to do that. Also, for
me personally, the gay community
has always been incredibly
supportive.
FELIX: Imperial College
Healthcare Trust is a world leader
in gender reassignment surgery.
However, it seems that the ICSM
doesn’t provide much (if any)
training to its students in the field.
What would you say about this?
FELIX interviews 29 year-old Anjeli Patel, who works at Ernst & Young, on being
trans, being Indian and the equality in the workplace
Ben Williams
Writer
I’ve always
felt,
intrinsically,
inside, that
I’m female,
even prior
to any
surgery
AJ: Treating a transgender person
is more than learning about how
to complete gender reassignment
surgery. You are quite often giving
that person their life back. It’s vital
that ICSM members are taught the
importance and the duty of care they
have when dealing with transgender
patients. The emotional aspect of
support is just as important as the
surgical.
FELIX: Was there ever a point
where you questioned the transition?
AJ: Yes, there was. Not that I
questioned who I was, I questioned
the methods that I’d chosen. There
were times when I look back and
think – I wish I had got a job first, I
wish I had secured myself financially
before transitioning.
In terms of friends or family, I’d
say I lost 90% of my friends circle
when I said that I was going to
transition. That really made me
think, “am I doing the right thing?
This is going to continue getting
worse.”
But I didn’t really ever question
the transition itself because I’d
known from a young age that, in my
heart, it was the right thing to do.
There were points where I
questioned other people, I’d say
– about why they would want to
treat me so differently when I was
still the same person inside. But not
really the transition itself, no.
FELIX: So you talked about EY
– are there still barriers to LBGT+
people in the workplace?
AJ: People in an interview setting
want to hire people that almost
mirror their own way of thinking.
It’s normal human nature to align
with people that you have an affinity
with.I find that a massive stumbling
block in itself. To be honest, I was
doing myself a huge disservice. I
would prepare for a week, 2 weeks,
and then apply to the kind of places
where I wasn’t valued. It almost got
to the point where I thought, well,
I’m not going to continue looking
for work. Luckily, I found EY, and
they have been fantastic.
FELIX: What’s your general view
on positive discrimination?
AJ: I wouldn’t want to be selected
to do something just because I
was the token trans person or to
fill a quota. On the other hand,
positive discrimination is needed;
the workforce right now is just not
representative of society.
FELIX: For example, what’s your
position on trans people in sport?

doing so. Photo Credit: Vanity Fair
AJ: My opinion is a little
controversial. It’s just a personal
one, I know there are arguments
on both sides. For me, for
someone who is born a
male to compete alongside
other biological females...
I completely understand
the fact that internally you
feel female – obviously
I’m going through it
myself. However, I
also wonder if you
are at a physical
advantage...and
I worry it could,
perhaps, make
the competition
unfair. Obviously,
if you can ensure
the competition is
equal, trans people
should absolutely
compete alongside
their chosen gender.
FELIX: I guess
the dream has
always been that
one day things
like Stonewall
don’t exist.
That this
i n t e r v i e w isn’t
n e w s , t h a t
someone can say “I’m a woman”
or “I’m gay” and no one cares.
Will that day come?
AJ: I hope so. Whether it will
actually happen or not, I don’t
know. I’m not sure, because of what
I’ve been through, it’s not an easy
call.
FELIX: Are we getting there?
AJ: I think we’re moving in the
right direction, yes. There’s been
huge movement in the last year or
two. What I fear for trans people at
the minute is that it almost seems
like you’re acceptable, and you’re
fine, so long as visually you fit
into what is conventionally male
or female. There’s a pressure to
be ‘the perfect woman’. My big
hope that we start to see more
visible trans people outside of
entertainment, actually working
in government, the corporate sector
and within other industries.
FELIX: Imperial says it wants to
get more women into STEM. At
the moment, we’ve got a ratio of
60:40. How do we make those steps
to stop people taking one look and
turning away?
AJ: I get what you’re saying about
the ratio... but for me, it wasn’t just
about the numbers. It was about
the way that people treated me.
These places felt very oppressively
corportate – more like an old boy’s
club than anything else. There was
very little passion there, very little
understanding. You need to change
the culture, not just the rules or the
people.
