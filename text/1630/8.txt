T
he odds are good, but
the goods are odd, or so
goes the saying on the
‘talent’ at our beloved
university. It’s an oft-referred trope
of Imperial: on open days, we’re
warned that there’s no shortage of
dudes, and forced conversations
during freshers’week often resort to,
“Wow, there are loads of guys here!”
We’re always talking about the male
experience, or lack thereof in terms
of sexual opportunity, but what of
the women of Imperial?
We didn’t perch on the Queen’s
Lawn lions with a DSLR, waiting
to pounce on people Humans of
New York-style, but rather asked
some women to talk about their
female specific experiences at
Imperial, whether they were good
or bad, and how small, dismissable
things effected their existence as a
woman at a university where 64% of
us are guys.
The whitewashed Women@
Imperial exhibit by the revolving
doors of the Business School
only tells part of the story. Much
like brands’ obnoxious use of
International Women’s Day to
promote their wares on social media,
efforts like this can feel contrived.
We all know that workplaces have
a problem with diversity at their
highest level, and Imperial is no
different.
After ‘Misogyny at Varsity’
last year, when a Sport Imperial
employee said he “didn’t care how
those fat girls got home”, Imperial
commissioned an investigation
into the culture of gender, which
is currently being conducted by
external academics.But then we had
the very Provost who commissioned
it, Debra Humphris, leave us for
Brighton.
The Angry Grad makes a
triumphant return below. Despite
initial speculation that the FELIX
comment’s outspoken columnist
was a man, she ain’t. Angry Grad
is a job-having graduate who’s been
through the Imperial system, and
experienced the medical school
with all its foibles.
FELIX: What kind of attitudes
did you encounter from students
or teaching staff on the subject of
gender?
Angry Grad: Staff thankfully
treated me equal to my male
counterparts. However, my student
experience was quite different. In
fact, it’s kind of made me aware that
some of my mates are downright
sexist – I’m possibly having such a
bloody epiphany right now that I
may need re-think my friend circle
as a SIW (strong independent
woman).
For example, from good ideas in
a tutorial to a friendly conversation
with a lecturer, I’ve been made
aware that some of the affirmation
I may have gotten is likely is due to
my gender, as “professors are nicer
to girls.”
This passing comment didn’t
bother me much at the time, and
I’m sure many of you have heard this
too. Hell, if anything, one up for the
girls, right? Yet on second thought,
the connotations associated with
such remarks are downright
disheartening. They imply that any
achievements I may have made are,
perhaps, not worthy of the merit
they received. They imply that,
because I’m a woman, academics
who are aware of my soft nature,
inability to deal with critique, and
low self-esteem, have given me
credit where it isn’t due.
Some mates of mine have gone
as far as to say that members
of their year probably got into
Imperial because of their boobs,
not their brains. This cynicism is

opinions are
not a joke.
Is it time to
shut up?
The women of Imperial

pretty disgusting, and if anything,
transparently shows the insecurity
of my peers who feel threatened.
While yes, all of these remarks have
come from men, women shouldn’t
be so blasé and simply accept them.
The idea “bat your eyelashes and
you’ll get your way” implies we have
it easy, in whatever we endeavour
to do, which couldn’t be any more
opposite of our reality.
Remember the suffragette
movement, kids? Hardly glamorous
was it. So, what I’m trying to say
here is it’s not the attitude of just
men that needs to change. Rather,
it’s society’s attitude towards
women. Sounds obvious I know,
but it’s the subtle things that make
all the difference, like these niggly
comments here and there. Our
It’s the

things that

difference
achievements should be celebrated,
men and women and alike, and
shouldn’t be scrutinised because of
gender differences.
FELIX: How did the gender ratio
affect you, if at all?
AG: Not at all to be honest. My
course was a bit of a fanny fest, so
I never really experienced isolation
as a female, which Imperial is
notorious for.
FELIX: Did you feel like one of
the lads whilst you were doing your
degree?
AG: I’ve never been a “girly girl,”
which is a description that is sexist
in itself, but alas the stereotype
fits the point I’m trying to make
(#doublestandards).
In short, whilst I never have felt
like one of the lads, the comment
has been passed numerous times.
Am I offended by it? It’s a difficult
one. If it implies that I’m not a
Regina George, then no. But if it
also means that I am not feminine,
then 100% yes. Being feminine
in my opinion, has become
synonymous for being quiet and
soft. Yes, I’m boisterous, bossy and
some people have even called me
intimidating. But it upsets me that
these take away from my femininity,
and are more associated with a male
stereotype.The worst thing is, when
I have been called a lad before, I’ve
taken it as a compliment; people
are saying that I’m not a gossiping,
make-up obsessed, shallow girl.
But the fact that I myself
have leapt on
first thought to such conclusions, is
pretty worrying. I consider myself
a feminist after all, and if I myself
associate femininity with such
values, how do I expect others not
to?
Angry Grad felt conflicted
between proudly wearing her
badge of being ‘one of the lads’ to
her own discount of femininity as a
weakness.
Should you call out your mates
when they’re problematic and run
the risk of pissing them off? Simran,
a fresher from the RSM, had this to
say.
FELIX: What issues do you think
you deal with as a woman of colour
at Imperial?
Simran: I feel like I have to
work to prove myself to my peers.
Sometimes I feel like people expect
me to represent everyone from
my background, which is a lot of
pressure. During first term, I’d get
asked a lot about my background
(and then my parents’ background,
when I’d say I’m from London)
and often I’d get a response like
“Afghan girl from state school to
do engineering? You must have
been an admissions statistic dream!”
Or even worse “Your parents were
REFUGEES?! WELL DONE!”.
It’s a sort of motivation,when it isn’t
totally depressing.
FELIX: Are you
ever made aware of
your gender in your
department?
S: As with any
e n g i n e e r i n g
d e p a r t m e n t ,
Materials is quite
male-dominated,
so I’m definitely
aware of
the gender
dynamic.

FRIDAY 5th FEBRUARY 2016
The Student Newspaper of Imperial College London
Y
esterday the union told
RAG its magazine of
adverts and satire was
“beyond the acceptable
bounds of satire or mockery”. RAG
werealsowarnedthattheindividuals
involved in writing it could
be
faced with serious consequences
from the college if they continued
to distribute the magazine as this
would
be
considered “elevated
harassment”.
Not banning it as such, the union
strongly advised RAG to surrender
all leftover copies as well as issue
an apology to all those affected,
understood by FELIX to be the

Union President.
FELIX has seen the 16 page
handout, which is mainly adverts
for RAG week events, including the
bungee jump, tunnel tours and the
Valentine’s Ball. There are three or
four pages of ‘satire’ of the union-
hack variety, which
(obviously)
we are unable to print here. The
offending piece was a mock diary
entry, reminiscent of
FELIX
Hangman’s ‘Diary of a Fresher’
written from the perspective of the
Union President.
Its writer told FELIX they were
“appalled” at the union’s decision to
“censor”the piece.
“I hope that the Union's attempts
to withdraw
all copies of the
uncensored version will not be
successful, and that the students
RAG mag accused of
"harassment and bullying"
The handout will no longer be distributed after union
tells RAG it's "an unacceptable personal attack"
who do get to see the Mag as-is will
realise how absurd the response of
the Union has been”.
500 copies of the 2000 magazines
RAG printed
have already been
given out around campus. This cost
RAG around £400.
Alice
Gast, the president of
Imperial, who wrote a short
introduction for the magazine, said
today: "This year’s RAG Magazine
is a discredit to RAG’s legacy and to
the College".
"I find the mean spirited approach
to targeting of individuals within
the magazine disgusting and am
sorry that I agreed to provide a note
for inclusion in it".
"I’m pleased to see the Union’s
strong response..."

Medics' Circle Line will
be alcohol free
Circle Line changes will see drinking swapped for
good deeds
T
he ICSM Student Union
has been forced to reign
in its plans for RAG
week, due to growing
pressure from the college over recent
alcohol-fuelled bad behaviour.
The annual Circle Line Pub
Crawl usually involves a charity
bucket election for ICSM RAG at
stations around the Circle Line, as
well as stops as multiple pubs along
the way. The night usually ends at
the Clapham Grand.
However, this year, the ICSMSU
has announced to its members that
pub stops will not be an official part
of the event. Any student visiting
one on the day will be doing so
“on their own actions, not as an
ambassador of ICSMSU”.
Pub stops will be
replaced
with volunteering opportunities,
including street collections, singing
in hospitals and other volunteering
opportunities at stops on the Circle
line. Any student involved will also
get free entry to the club afterwards.
The President of the Medical
School’s Union told students on
Monday that scrubs may not be
worn in the club afterwards.
This comes after students on the
medic boat club’s trip to Leuven
were refused passage on a P&O ferry
after students were deemed “drunk
and disorderly”. The ICSMSU has
since banned alcohol consumption
on coaches.
This and other alcohol-related
incidents over the years
now
threaten
ICSM
students union’s
independence. In an email to the
medical student body this week,
the ICSMSU president said: “The
history of events has now led to the
heads of College questioning why
the faculty of medicine should have
its own Students’Union”.

year on both

from Sport
Imperial
and
alleged sexism
from the RAG mag
writers. Photo Credit: FELIX
The atmosphere, and the sorts
of comments people make are
influenced by it. I often find
myself having to explain why rape
shouldn’t be a punchline. People
know this already, but I feel there’s a
competition to say the most twisted
laaaaaad banter joke, because that’s
somehow manly and deserving of
respect.
FELIX: Is having female lecturers
important to you?
Simran: In the materials
department, there are quite a few
female lecturers. I love seeing
them, partly because it helps me
see a place for myself in academia.
I think they’re criticised more, and
in a different way to their male
counterparts. “Why doesn’t she
panopto? What a hoe,” “She’s in
a bad mood cos she’s put on even
more weight over the weekend” or
“maybe she’s on her period” .
FELIX: What impact do ‘small’
comments have on your experience
as a woman?
S: It’s difficult. Mostly I find them
frustrating – I don’t know what the
best way to react to them is.For the
most part, I don’t think sexism is
thought about before they are made.
I don’t think people are immediately
aware of their biases and why they
want to use slut as an insult when
they refer to a woman. Instances
like this are so common that I start
to feel like a broken record.
People don’t like to be criticised,
often I am accused of attacking
their freedom of speech. My
new nickname is ‘PC Simran of
the thought police’. People don’t
understand that small comments

and later went on to become Imperial’s third female professor. Photo Credit:
Imperial College London
show attitudes which breed actions,
and their TOP BANTS is fuelling
discrimination. They say that they
would “never actually DO anything
discriminatory.” I don’t think
that’s good enough. It’s become
something of a joke – someone will
say something horrible in a group
chat and wait till Simran reads it.
I’m not trying to be entertaining
and my opinions are not a joke. Is it
time to shut up?
FELIX: Are they any other
incidents that stand out?
S: I was talking to one of my
friends about this. In a tutorial
she was told by one of her peers
to write on the board because
“everyone wants to look at the
pretty girl”. When we spoke about
it, I found that many of our friends
saw this as “just a compliment”
and not a horribly sexist example
of objectification. Another time, I
was drinking juice from a straw in
a lecture and a comment was made
about how it looked like I was
fellating the straw. I made a snarky
comment in response, but haven’t
had an innocent carton since.
Celeste van den Bosch is a PhD
in materials, and is the postgraduate
representative for the Athena Swan
committee for the department.
FELIX: Are there any challenges
you face in the department that your
male counterparts do not?
Celeste: In my experience
working as first an Undergraduate
in the Chemistry Department and
now a PhD student in the Materials
Department at Imperial I haven’t
felt as though there is a difference
in the challenges faced by students
of different genders. On the news
and through social media, a number
of issues which can affect women
in the workplace are often touted,
notably gender based harassment,
unequal pay and lack of family
support. To address these, I am
funded by EPSRC which provides
a set stipend for PhD students and
while it hasn’t been important in
my life yet, talking to postdocs in
the department I understand that
the Department of Materials is
supportive of expecting mothers.
FELIX:Is being a man at Imperial
the default?
C: It is a fact that there are more
men at Imperial, however, I think
that being a man is by no means
the default. In my experience,
all students are given an equal
opportunity at Imperial. I think
there should be more women in
science. This is something that
needs to be addressed by society
as a whole, rather than Imperial
specifically, so that more girls are
encouraged to follow a Science,
Engineering, Technology career
path.
FELIX: Are women at Imperial
supporting each other as much as
they could be?
C: I don’t think it’s a question of
women supporting other women, I
think it should be people supporting
people.I do have a female supervisor
and there are a number of other
female PhDs, as well as women on
the academic and technical staff
within the department that I talk to.
But equally I also count on fellow
male PhD students, academics
and technical staff for support and
stimulating conversation. I trust
that they feel the same way about
my contributions.
There are
more men
at Imperial,
however, I
think that
being a man

means the
