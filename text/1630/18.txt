FILM
O
ld Hollywood’ is a
hell of a drug. In an
age of social media
saturation and online
engagement, we long for the
halcyon days of the glamourous
star, as perfect and distant as a
far-flung constellation. No matter
how much dirt is unearthed on the
horror of the old studio system –
which includes forced marriages,
arranged murders, and dodgy mob
connections – there’s still an aching
for a time long past; a willingness
to swap enlightened debates about
gender and race for just one more
Rita Hayworth flick. Hail, Caesar!,
the latest from the Coen brothers,
takes aim at our love for nostalgia,
throwing us into the wheelings and
dealings of the chaotic world of
Hollywood, communist tap dancers
and all.
Our guide in this world is Eddie
Mannix (Josh Brolin), the head
of production at Capitol Pictures,
who works as a ‘fixer’, ensuring that
the gossip columns are kept free
of damaging details of stars’ sexual
trysts, or unlicensed pictures. Set
in 1951, the film takes place at a
point when the studio system was
beginning to decline, following the
1948 anti-trust rulings, but you
wouldn’t know it based on how
things are going. The studio is just
about to finish production on their
prestige picture 'Hail, Caesar!' (the
firstinaseriesofsub-filmscontained
in this meta-movie), which features
one of the biggest stars of the age,
Baird Whitlock (George Clooney,
challenging Kirk Douglas): it's
stirring speeches, lounging around
in togas, and perma-tan.
Unfortunately for Mannix,
Whitlock is drugged and kidnapped
by a shadowy cabal of communist
screenwriters, direct from the
nightmares of Joseph McCarthy.
With the studio bleeding cash, and
the picture unfinished, Mannix
needs to get Whitlock back as
soon as possible, while ensuring
the story stays out of the papers,
run by Thora and Thessaly Thacker
(Tilda Swinton), a pair of warring
columnist sisters. Along the way,
however, Mannix faces a number
of other problems, each of which
allows the audience a small glimpse
of the films being worked on.

Hail, Caesar!
should be
a comedic
balloon, but
someone
has let the
air out
Not all roads lead to Rome
The latest from the Coen brothers is solid filmmaking, but lacks a sense of energy
There’s DeeAnne Moran (Scarlett
Johannson), a swimming starlet
whose orchestra-led synchronised
routine is being derailed by her
burgeoning pregnancy making it
difficult to fit into her fish-tail;
Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich),
a cowboy actor whose image needs
changing, landing him in the lap
of acclaimed director Lawrence
Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) currently
making a classic period drama;
and Burt Gurney (Channing
Tatum) who is hiding a political
secret, which is only revealed to
us after we sit through a sailor-
led dance routine – reminding
us that Hollywood managed to
simultaneously discriminate against
gay people,and unironically enthuse
about singing sea-men.
The film may have been reported
as a ‘love letter to Hollywood’, but
really the opposite is the truth: the
films on display are all dire; they
seem like campy schlock, and serve
to remind us that for every Streetcar
Named Desire there were countless
other works deservedly consigned
to the trashcan of history. At these
moments, the film is at its acerbic
best, the script imbued with a
cutting, razor-sharp wit.
And yet,there was a nagging sense
throughout that, as hard as I wanted
to love the film, things just weren't
working. There’s a lack of energy,
and while individual scenes are
fantastic, they are stitched together
all higgledy-piggledy, revealing a
lack of craftsmanship on the part
of the Coens. Hail, Ceasar! should
be a light comedic balloon, one that
zips along like the best of screwball
comedies, but it feels like someone
has let all the air out, and the film
plods instead.
Part of this is down to the plot:
normally a high-point of the
brothers’ films, in Hail, Ceasar!
the different strands never come
together, instead spinning out in all
directions. Whitlock’s kidnapping,
the central plot,stands alone,and the
other characters never really seem to
have anything to do with it – scenes
hang there, only linked through
Michael Gambon’s unnecessary
narration. Furthermore, while the
casting and acting is all excellent,
there is a serious underuse of certain
actors: Johannson, for instance, who
spits out her lines with aplomb after
chewing them through a New Jersey
accent, is only really present for a
couple of scenes, and we only get
exposed to the magnificent Frances
McDormand – who brings a spirit
of physical comedy to the screen –
in a single scene. It’s a real shame.
However, it is worth pointing
out one great thing about the film,
and that is the casting of Alden
Ehrenreich, who up to this point
has only had a handful of roles.
The Coen brothers have a habit
of picking excellent actors out of
the pile of unknowns – think their
choice of Michael Stuhlbarg in
A Serious Man – and Ehrenreich
is no exception. A doe-eyed ball
of cinematic energy, Ehrenreich
steals all scenes he’s in, whether it’s
crooning at the moon in a pastiche
Western, or performing lasso tricks
with a piece of spaghetti to impress
a Carmen Miranda-type, it is
impossible to take your eyes off him.
With an exceptional cast, a
punchy script, and a setting ripe for
poking fun at, it seems that Hail,
Caesar! had all the pins lined up
for a barnstormer of a film, it just
needed to knock them down. But
something has gone wrong along
the way, and – while amusing –
the way the film drags means that
Hail, Caesar! is destined to be one
of the brothers’ lesser works, one
they needed to put more effort into:
Rome, as it turns out, wasn’t built in
a day.

Documentary corner: 20 Feet From Stardom
Ben Collier
Film Writer
D
arlene Love, Merry
Clayton, Lisa Fischer…
you probably don’t
know these names but
I guarantee you know the voices.
20 Feet from Stardom is a talking-
heads documentary that tells of the
relatively unknown world of such
backup vocalists. Prior to making
this film, its director, Morgan
Neville, spent much of his career
documenting various musician’s
careers, from Jack Clement to
Johnny Cash to Iggy Pop; with this
feature however,he gives us his most
ambitious project, as well as his first
Oscar winner. Going into this film I
had a lot of expectations about what
I was going to see; I anticipated a
depressing tale of talent-gone-
unnoticed, and failure to achieve
one’s dreams.This isn’t what I got.
In actuality the message of this
film is rather uplifting: Darlene
Love, for example, despite many
hardships, is shown being inducted
into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame, touring with Sting and The
Rolling Stones, and performing
on David Letterman come the
end. In fact, my favourite anecdote
from the entire feature is when
Love talks about how she cleaned
houses during a lull in her career
before she heard ‘Christmas (Baby
Please Come Home)’ play on the
radio, a hit song for which she had
provided ghost vocals,an experience
that spurred her to return to music
and find success. By the end of the
film we are treated to a plethora
of uplifting philosophies held by
these women, who love singing and
simply want to share their passion.
Many are happy to stay out of
the limelight and share their gift
without the hardships of fame – as
Lisa Fisher says, had she made it
big she probably would have OD’d
within a year.
A specific focus is given to the
fact that many backup vocalists
were – and continue to be – black
women with a background in gospel
singing, and many of issues around
discrimination and institutionalised
racism are explored. Whilst this
is a very interesting topic, it is one
that could well warrant its very own
documentary, and these parts of the
film represent its overall weaknesses,
where the director seems to have
spread himself too thin. I would
have much preferred a more focused
look at fewer of these women, or
a more nuanced view on the race
issues, or the evolution of rock and
roll. Having all of these topics in
one film is a simply cramming, and
while we get a bit of information
about a lot of things, we never get to
spend enough time with any of the
women to really form a connection.
All the best documentaries have an
emotional element we can become
invested in, along with a clear
narrative, but it is this element 20
Feet lacks. Had I seen it as a TV
documentary (or better yet 5-part
series), I would have loved it. But as
a feature however? It doesn’t really
hold up.

Goodnight Mommy
Dir: Veronika Franz, Severin Fiala.
Script: Veronika Franz, Severin
Fiala. Starring: Lukas Schwarz,
Elias Schwarz, Susanne Wuest. 99
minutes.
I
f you’re in two minds about
whether or not to have
children, watching Goodnight
Mommy should put you
right off. An Austrian horror
centring around the relationship
between a mother and her children,
Goodnight Mommy is a dark, cold
exploration of identity and power.
Its Shyamalan-esque twist might
not be to everyone’s tastes, but it
can’t ruin the carefully constructed
sense of unease that runs through
the film like a dark undercurrent.
Set in a austere modernist house
in the isolated Austrian countryside,
Goodnight Mommy sees a mother
(Susanne Wuest) return home to
her twin sons (Elias and Lukas
Schwarz), after having drastic facial
surgery, which has left her covered
in bandages. With her behaviour
strangely altered, the boys begin
to suspect that she might not be
their mother after all; what follows
is a dizzying power struggle,
as characters compete for the
audience’s attention, culminating in
an orgiastic display of violence.
Directors Veronika Franz and
Severin Fiala approach the subject
like an exercise in film-making,
and there are some stunning shots;
scenes that feature the twins acting
as ghostly mirrors of each other and
visual constructions that obscure
the face crop up again and again.
References to modern art – Gerhard
Richter paintings on the walls, links
to the work of Damien Hirst, and
perhaps Marina Abramovic – give
us the first hint that this is more
nuanced than standard horror fare.
What Franz and Fiala manage to
do exceptionally well is construct
a believable sense of ambiguity
around the characters – we really
aren’t sure what is going on, and
who we are supposed to support.
The twist that comes towards the
end of the film is predictable (at
least, my companion found this to
be the case, I was too busy focussing
on the visuals),but it doesn’t manage
to disturb the carefully-crafted
equilibrium of the film. Really the
twist is a secondary consideration,
and doesn’t manage to neatly tie up
the plot, leaving the audience with
more questions than answers.
The film’s themes, of how we
construct our identity around
visibility, are fascinating, and draw
immediate comparison to George
Franju’s Eyes Without a Face,
although I think the exploration
of behavioural changes associated
with a lack of identity are more
reminiscent of HiroshiTeshigahara’s
The Face of Another, a tale of a
man whose face is burnt off in an
industrial accident. The adjectives
‘Austrian’ and ‘chilly’ evoke a link
to the work of Michael Haneke,
but Goodnight Mommy is more
closely related to Ulrich Seidl (who
serves as the project’s producer),
particularly the ambiguity of his
documentary In the Basement.
The debut feature film from Franz
and Fiala, I cannot wait to see what
they get up to next. A measured,
superbly controlled film, Goodnight
Mommy will leave you with an
indelible distrust of children, and
a feeling of creeping disquiet that
persists long after you leave the
cinema.
