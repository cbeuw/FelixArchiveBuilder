What makes an Adaptation?

T
he year of 1994 was a
wildly different time.
Institutional racism in
America was under the
limelight following the release of
footage of police brutality against
an unarmed black man. The public
imagination was infatuated with a
murder trial that didn’t quite make
sense and seemed to unfairly target
one man. Also, the Kardashians
were big in the news. How the
world changes, eh?
American Crime Story
documents and dramatizes, though
only slightly, the tumultuous and
frantic events surrounding the
murder of American football star
OJ Simpson’s ex-wife,Nicole Brown
Simpson, and OJ’s subsequent
trial for the crime. The show, as is
becoming something of a trend as
of late, has an all-star cast; with
the likes of Cuba Gooding Jr. and
David Schwimmer taking on the
roles of O.J. and Rob Kardashian,
respectively.
In general, the acting is very
good, and one of the series’ great
strengths is that it chooses not
to focus particularly on Simpson
himself, but rather on the plethora
of unique personalities drawn into
the whole sordid saga. If ever a
piece was fitting of the descriptor
‘ensemble cast’, this would be it.The
closest thing to a protagonist lies in
prosecutor Marcia Clark; though
the show takes pains to ensure
neither side is outright vilified.
Sarah Paulson shines as Clark;
bringing just the right amount of
ferocity and self-assuredness to the
viewers. If there’s one fault to be
found in the piece’s characterisation,
it’s that it plays on some of the
‘popular’ideas of what certain people
were like, rather than representing
them entirely accurately. But hey, it
makes for good TV.
One of the other pillars of the
show is its pacing. Every episode
feels tightly plotted; right from
the start. The opening sequence,
contextualising the era by showing
us the Rodney King beating and
subsequent riots, followed by
the fast-moving breakdown of
the discovery of the crime and
its evidence, are instantly and
powerfully gripping. This trend is
the fusion of the ‘White Bronco’
chase with the Beastie Boys’
‘Sabotage’. In fact, the soundtrack
choice throughout is pretty great.
Occasionally, however, the cheese
gets a bit much and overpowers the
meat of the story. Moments like the
voicemails from O.J’s kids to their
dead mother are a bit much and
despite being historically probable,
stretch credulity slightly and take
you out of the story a bit. There
are also certain points where we
are treated to some well written,
wonderfully subtle subtext, only to
have it be immediately explained by
the characters. There’s also way too
much of a focus on the Kardashian
kids, for seemingly no other reason
than to cash in on their popularity.
There’s also a random,really obvious
and heavy handed, and, in my
opinion, unnecessary shot thrown at
them in the third episode. But then,
I’m a fan of Yeezy and by extension,
Kim, so maybe I’m a little biased
there.
Overall, the show feels like an
anti-‘Making a Murderer’. Here,
we follow a charismatic team of
lawyers as they get off a (let’s face
it) probably guilty double murderer,
while a battered district attorney
tries desperately to stop them. I
highly recommend this to any
True Crime fans, and anyone who’s
looking for something good to
follow. I’m definitely hooked, and in
this till the end.
American Crime Story is available
on Amazon Prime
role. She is expertly framed as a
tragic hero; giving her the audience
support and goodwill despite the
foregone conclusion.
Another standout performance
comes from Courtney B. Vance;
playing what quickly became
my favourite character, Johnnie
Cochran. Vance’s energy and
suave demeanour are downright
contagious. He’s the salesman
who you know is trying to sell
you something, but you can’t
help be charmed. At the end of
the day, you’re going home with
that extended warranty. There’s a
character for everyone, and some
great ‘magnificent bastard’moments
that’ll be sure to get smirks out of
continued in the second episode; the
entirety of which is dedicated to the
now infamous ‘White Bronco’ car
chase. The writing always keeps the
audience’s pulse high, and ensures
that momentum is not lost, even in
mellower moments. No scene feels
wasted or outstays its welcome;
though this is often the luxury of
a mini-series that knows exactly
how long it has to cover something.
They even manage to sneak in some
really great, if sometimes subtle,
humorous moments (‘who the hell
brings a lawyer to a funeral?’ asks
the paparazzo while trying to take
pictures of it).
There is a tendency to be a bit
cheesy here and there. At times,
this pays off brilliantly; the most
prominent example so far being

T
hese days it seems
like the most popular
medium for TV shows
to take inspiration
from is the literary one. With
several books, graphic novels and
comics, sometimes with decades
of mythology, it’s hard to see why
not. When something works in a
medium where scenes are static or
left to the imagination, then seeing
them in action should be something
special. These days, there are a large
number of successful shows and
series which are, in some shape or
form, adaptations. So in this piece,
I’ll be examining, what makes a
good adaptation and what are the
key areas TV show creators end up
either nailing or ruining.
The very first thing which comes
to mind is source material. If it’s
worked once, why fix what isn’t
broken? For the most part this is
true; however, if the show is too
close to its source, it adds nothing
substantial. The key thing here is to
respect and understand the source
material, but also not bog things
down. Novel and comic book series
should set the overall atmosphere
and blueprint, but shows should try
to be fresh and do something which
makes them unique.
For an obvious example, we can
look at the CW’s adaptations
of various DC Comics heroes
and stories. While they get some
elements right, they are different
and special in their own right. As an
extension of my point, these shows
need to make sure to not just cater
to the fans. Shows like Arrow and
Flash bring in a lot of mythology
from the over 50-year history of
the characters, but they’re able to
do it in a way that someone who
isn’t comic-literate can appreciate
them. Its nice to have Easter eggs
and little nods to fans, but the basic
elements of these shows needs to be
understandable without having to
check Wikipedia.
While originality is good,there are
certain limits shows need to stick to
or work around. Game of Thrones
is known for being excellent at
adapting The Song of Ice and Fire.
However, when it comes to putting
its own spin on things and trying
out a new direction, there’s usually
mixed reactions at best. Shows
which are more loosely adapted like
Sherlock can also work really well,
though sometimes they go the way
of Dexter or Vampire Diaries where
both the book and TV medium
have diverged greatly, and not for
the better.Being original and telling
your own story is all well and good,
but it should never be forgotten why
the original works were so successful
in the first place. For example, while
the Walking Dead is a good enough
TV show on its own, it’s only a
shadow of its comic book self and
is a rather weak representation as a
whole.
A bad move to make on the part
of the executives would be to get
the characters wrong. Unless they
are very, very clever, the worst thing
creators could do would be to just
slap in a character and not deliver
on their potential, or just get them
plain wrong. Honestly, as long
as you can really understand the
characters and the root of the story,
it’s hard to mess up.
Batman: The Brave and the Bold
features Batman at his most light-
hearted, fighting telepathic gorillas,
going into space and teaming up
with a large variety of colorful and
ostentatious characters. However,
it never forgets who Batman is and
what his origins are; he’s always
grounded and behaves exactly as you
would expect Batman to behave. By
comparison, the Dresden Files TV
series was known for changing its
characters and being a more watered
down version of the beloved book
series. It would probably explain
why the show was axed after one
season.
Bringing a series to life and
making it fit the TV medium is
also a challenge in its own right.
Comic books rely on bright and
colourful but essentially static
pictures to tell the story. Stories
from books are completely crafted
by your imagination. Care needs to
be taken to visualise and recreate
iconic scenes and characters in a
way which everyone can appreciate.
There are also several subtle touches
and mechanisms which need to be
accounted for.In books,exposition is
just given but in TV shows, it needs
to be woven into the action in some
way. It has to be revealed as things
are happening – the same being true
for any backstory elements.
Most shows are able to grasp
this and make good work with it.
Game of Thrones does well with
its depictions of various locations
as well as big climactic moments
like the Battle of Blackwater, or
seeing the dragons in action. TV
shows are also the best medium
for comic books as they are able
to adopt the nature of serialized
storytelling extremely well. This
can be validated by all the great live
action and animated series that have
been produced.
With more and more successful
shows, even more stories and
adventures get adapted. To name a
few, Neil Gaiman’s American Gods
and Lemony Snicket’s A Series of
Unfortunate Events are coming up
and in production. Adaptations just
aren’t going away and every time a
showrunner nails all the sweet spots,
it’s one more great show for all of us
to watch and enjoy.
