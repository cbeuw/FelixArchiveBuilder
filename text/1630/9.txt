eteorites and volcanic
eruptions; large
events as such are
generally considered
to have led to the dinosaurs’ demise.
However,their legacy is not simple –
they lived, big rock collides with the
Earth, they died. The Ichthyosaur,
otherwise known as the ‘fish lizard’,
bewildered scientists with its
sudden disappearance some 34-35
million years before the cretaceous-
paleocene extinction event. Novel
research has put some ease to
scientists deliberations, finding that
climate change could have been the
guilty culprit to the Ichthyosaur’s
extinction.
The famous fossil fanatic, Mary
Anning, discovered Ichthyosaur
fossilised remains in 1810, near
Lyme Regis, Dorset. Since,
scientists have strived to understand
the Ichthyosaur species further,
finding that it was a very diversified
organism especially towards the end
of its reign. Thus it is surprising to
learn that it was in fact a very slow
adapting species. When you couple
slow adaptation with environmental
volatility, extinction usually soon
follows. Ichthyosaurs were exposed
to rising sea levels and temperatures,
which rapidly reorganised marine
ecosystems some 100 million years
ago. Lead researchers, Dr Valentine
Fischer of the University of Liege
and the University of Oxford, said
that the fish’s ability to adapt was
just “too slow”. Scientists can now

Who really killed the Ichthyosaur?
Science, what’s good?
As a genus, Hydra species are
up there with the ‘weird’ and
‘wonderful’, ripping their own skin
apart to open their mouths and
eat. For the first time, scientists
have illustrated the biomechanics
of this process. The Hydra hangs
around, literally adhered to a rock
or other surface, and waits until
the unknowing prey falls victim
to Hydra’s prevailing tentacles. A
brush against it leads to the release
of a poisoned barb stinging the prey
into paralysis. Specialised cells then
stretch apart as radially orientated
fibres contract. This allows the
Hydra to then swallow its prey
whole. Investigating this feeding
process at a cellular level has lead the
way for further investigations. Lead
researcher,Jason Carter,biophysicist
at the University of California, and
her research team, are now looking
at the physiological consequences of
this shape changing for the Hydra’s
cells.

ponder over this theory along with
previously proposed alternatives;
such as the rise of the bony fish, like
sharks, and their competitive edge,
chipping away at the Ichthyosaur’s
food supply.
This proposed theory gives an
essence to the past that breaths a
sharp chilling thought towards the
future of many of today’s species.
Today’s warming oceans and
melting ice caps evoke a feeling
of of ‘deja-vu’ threatening those
species, which like the Ichthyosaur,
might not be able adapt fast enough.

n our occidental institutions
of learning, the hallways
hear the daily echoes of
our scientific history being
taught in classrooms. “We stand
on the shoulders of giants” was a
12th
century quote, though more
commonly attributed to Sir Isaac
Newton. It’s an acknowledgment
of our predecessors, the trials and
errors, insights and ideas, lessons
and losses, all that we have built our
foundation of knowledge on.
But do we truly acknowledge
the entire foundation? Or are our
institutions culturally biased? I’m
thinking of the 4000 year old Hindu
records that describe an elegant
concept of matter so small it would
be indestructible – what we now
call an atom. Or recent research
that showed how Babylonians were
using geometry to calculate the
movements of Jupiter 14 centuries
before Europeans figured it out .
Alongside Mayans and Indians,
Babylonians independently came
up with the idea of the number zero
thousands of years ago. We take
it for granted now, but for much
of humanity, this emptiness had
no mathematical or placeholder
representation - and it was not
borne out of our occidental history.
Yet, we are not taught these
histories in our schools, not
until our hallowed flowering of
enlightened consciousness, wholly
and conveniently concentrated
in Europe. Unfortunately, it is
incredibly limiting to reinforce
such a historically linear European
narrative of science that ignores the
massive compendium of knowledge
that we have all actually been
drawing from (and lost much of) for
thousands of years from a complex
tapestry of different cultures and
histories worldwide - many of which
were often far more advanced than
us in their knowledge, innovation,
and science.
Given our access to almost all of
that information digitally, it’s time
for the occidental consciousness to
step back from our self-aggrandizing
and be humbled.I imagine we’ll find
more than a few lost lessons along
the way, as we walk our hallways
anew and begin to hear the echoes
of a more accurate scientific history
- one that sees all of the giants
whose shoulders we stand on.

Avoidable
errors in NHS
Open wide
Two reports published on Tuesday
from Imperial College suggest
that there are too many avoidable
errors in NHS patient care. The
first report criticises the National
Reporting and Learning System
(NRLS) which is used by staff
to report patient safety incidents,
specifically pointing out a worrying
occurrence of under-reporting.
However it also criticises the mind-
set of medical practitioners. Erik
Mayer, lead author, pointed out
that the “evidence suggests that as
little as five percent of patient safety
incidents are reported. This is often
related to the culture of institutions
and the culture of medicine.”
The second report offers
suggestions to improve patient
safety, and strongly pushes for
adoption of more digital solutions.
However, one has to ask: how
unavoidable are these errors when
medical practitioners across the UK
are overworked and underpayed?

Experimenting with dangerous
viruses, such as Ebola and
Measles, is risky enough. Imagine
using strains which have been
manipulated making them more
transmissible or virulent. Scary?
Representatives at the White House
consisting of scientists and public
health officials will meet Thursday
to debate whether a ban over
experiments making viruses more
virulent should be lifted.These fresh
new rules will work in conjunction
with strict regulations over panel
funding. Studies which are: not
considered important enough to
outweigh potential public health
risks, the results could be obtained
via safer means, or the researchers
lack the ability to work safely, will
not be funded. It is essentially a
trade off between risk and scientific
progression, stopping the potential
for a global pandemic whilst
providing the scientific expertise to
stop one.

ven though I don’t drink
coffee, which coming
from an Imperial college
student may sound like
an oxymoron, I have managed to
successfully get through all-nighters
on tea instead. Yet new research
suggests that drinking coffee may
have other benefits besides waking
your brain up for that 9am lecture.
Specifically, evidence suggests
that six cups of coffee a day can
significantly decrease chance of
developing multiple sclerosis (MS).
In a collaborative effort,
researchers from the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm, Johns
Hopkins University in Maryland
and the University of California
conducted studies in both the US
and Sweden, looking at when coffee
lovers had picked up their habit
as well as how much coffee they
indulged in. Results showed that
those who drank around 900 ml
of coffee a day (the equivalent of
six small cups or two Grande cups,
Starbucks style),were up to 30% less
likely to develop MS than people
not drinking coffee. Dr Emma
Gray, head of clinical trials at the
MS Society, argues: “This study
provides new evidence that the link
between the risk of developing MS
and coffee consumption is worth
exploring.”
This news is especially important
when taking into account that
despite having 100,000 people in
the UK alone suffering from MS,
relatively little is known about
what causes the disease. Symptoms
such as loss of motor function and
chronic pain to name but a couple,
are due to the destruction of the
myelin sheath around neurons, i.e.
demyelination. This slows down
the conduction of electronic signals
between the brain and the rest of
body, which causes physical and
sometimes even psychological
problems.
A wide range of factors, both
environmental and genetic, have
been suggested as underlying causes
but there is still no consensus
about what triggers demyelination.
So the apparent link between
coffee consumption and MS may
give researchers a new angle to
This latest media coffee
endorsement is part of a wider
trend in mainstream reporting. The
Daily Mail runs stories about the
miraculous effects of coffee almost
as regularly as it claims something
has been proven to cause cancer
(there’s a list of 116 factors last
time I checked). Only recently, it
was claimed that coffee reduces
chances of liver cirrhosis, helps
prevent early onset Alzheimer’s,
and even helps with the burning of
fat. However, these claims are not
fully substantiated and are often
contradicted by other data. While
it doesn’t necessarily discount the
research, much of the reporting on
health is highly simplified and prone
to exaggeration. Not to mention
that a lot of the health benefits fall
away when looking at people who
add high levels of milk and sugar
into their coffee.
So, before you run off to the
SAF café for a double shot of
espresso,keep in mind that as with
all observational studies, the results
are far from conclusive. And even
though researchers controlled their
studies to take into account other
potentially influencing factors, the
golden rule of science still remains
correlation does not necessarily
imply causation. So don’t use these

A knock to your confidence is
a thing many people at Imperial
may have experienced. No one
likes those horrible 40% grades.
However, new research suggests
that to be overconfident in tasks is
to have a closed mindset, thinking
that intelligence is fixed and
unchangeable. People who are
overconfident are such because
they choose tasks which are easy,
and spend little amount of time
on hard parts and tasks. People
who risk failure, diving in at the
deep end to challenge themselves
with more difficult tasks, tend to
have the view that intelligence is
something which can grow. As said
by Ainsley Mitchum of the Florida
State University and Carol Dweck
of Stanford University, ‘having a bit
of overconfidence is a good thing,
but large amounts can lead people
to make bad decisions and miss out
on opportunities to learn’.
