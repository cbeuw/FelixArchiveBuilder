otticelli Reimagined is
a curious marriage of
modern sensibilities with
15th
century grace, beauty,
and elegance, running at the V&A
until July. It is about the extent to
which the influence of that singular
craftsman, Sandro Botticelli –
father of Venus and Primavera –
permeated the art world through
the centuries.
The exhibits are eclectic – they’re
from film, photography, drawing,
sculpture, and even the fashion
world. We are treated to a truly
impressive melange of Botticelli fan-
art, including works by Magritte,
Warhol, Rossetti, each bringing to
Botticelli their own personal style
and flair in their various tributes, as
well as over fifty original works by
the master himself.
The exhibit is designed anti-

A compelling but contrariwise journey through Botticelli’s artistic influence
celebrated icon of human culture.
Why not start now, when Botticelli
is at the apex of relevancy and
fashion, and proceed backwards?
Itcertainlymakesforaninteresting
experience. Assaulting the eye upon
entry is a piece by Dolce & Gabbana
– which is, I believe, a company that
deals with fashionable things in the
present day, shoes and perfumes and
whatnot. It’s the ‘Venus Dress’, a
flowering garment that is patterned
with prints of the face and body of
Botticelli’s Venus.A plethora of chic
model shoots line the wall, where
beautiful women of today strike the
Venus pose, wearing pretty dresses,
gowns, and sometimes only a
carefully-placed object, much in the
vein of the FELIX centrefolds. The
essence of 15th
century aesthetics
may have fallen out of fad through
the ages,but the iconic pose remains.
As we move further down the
room, we see a Warhol piece –
the artist, as the caption tells us,
‘Rebirth of Venus’ by David LaChapelle, 2009. Photo Credit: Studio LaChapelle
also “reduced [Botticelli] to the
painter of a single, iconic image:
the Venus”. Indeed, he is not alone;
this exhibition could well be called
“Venus in the Uffizi: Reimagined”.
Accompanying Warhol is Jacquet,
titan of Nouveau Realism –
essentially the European version of
American Pop Art – who plasters
the goddess with iconography from
the oil company, Shell (I see what
you did there, Jacquet). Magritte
has his own take on the subject a
few metres away, with a work he
described as ‘Primavera by Botticelli
on a man with a bowler hat as seen
from behind’. Naturally, if Magritte
is inspired by something, he puts it
on a man with a bowler hat as seen
from behind! It’s an interesting
piece, and really juxtaposes two very
different sensibilities in a decidedly
curious way.
Twooftheartiststhatreallycaught
my eye were both contemporary
ones, so contemporary, in fact, that
they were actually present at the
press launch. It is fair to say that
the artists caught my eye as much
as their works did. The first was
Yin Xin, a Parisian artist whose
‘Venus after Botticelli’ is essentially
Botticelli’s Venus, in all its oil
and tempera glory, with one little
from the Victorian times. The
man behind the costume is equally
striking – an intelligent, resolute
figure who is among the most
enigmatic people I have ever had the
pleasure of interviewing. I chat with
him awhile about cross-cultural
standards of beauty, and eventually
our conversation turns to the more
interesting topic of surviving as
an oil-and-canvas artist in today’s
Parisian art climate. He believes in
sticking to the traditional ways, he
tells me,which I think is remarkable.
Many of the artists on display have
merely reproduced Botticelli, with
the modern instruments of pop-

art, 2nd
century clothing, computer
graphics, and photography. Yin
Xin, I feel, has truly reimagined the
master, and felt no need to resort
to wild changes in medium and
style for gimmicky effect. It’s worth
seeing this exhibition just to see his
work.
TheotherisacolourfulFrenchlady
by the name of ORLAN, who has
been pushing the boundaries of Art
ever since the 60s. Her contribution
to the exhibition includes
‘Hybridization of Botticelli’s Venus’,
where she morphs her own face
(purposefully frozen in something of
a macabre and intentionally horrific
expression) on to that of Venus.
Upon questioning, she tells me that
this was her attempt to ‘deconstruct’
the ideal of beauty, much in the
French Continental style of Derrida
and de Man. Another work is the
‘Occasional Strip-tease’, her final
pose a direct allusion to the Venus,
and yet another is ‘Operation
Opera’, where she is photographed
in the surgeon’s room while
undergoing various plastic surgery
procedures – the surgeons dressed
on her behest in fancy dress, the
bed surrounded by props ranging
from fruits to lobsters, and a book
of Lacanian philosophy in her hand.
change – Yin Xin’s Venus is Asian.
He maintains all the other formal
elements of Botticelli’s work, but
tweaks the features ever so slightly
so that she is now a symbol not
of European but Chinese beauty.

chronologically, starting with the
modern times and winding its way
back to the Old Masters. A curious
choice, made because “[Botticelli’s]
work has been the subject of a
complex process of reappraisal
which mirrors the changing
values of prosperity”, so they say.
Essentially, I think it means to say
that the master has been getting
more popular as time goes by – his
work was forgotten in its own day,
progressively rediscovered in the 19th
century, and gained popularity over

My interview with her reveals that
she considers herself more of a
philosopher than an artist – she is
also something of an exhibit, I feel,
as a horde of photographers casually,
silently, take flash pictures of her
with their camera inches from her
face. I wonder if she is more popular
than her art, as is the sad affliction
of many ‘modern’ artists these days.
The rest of the exhibition is a
conventional romp through art
from the previous centuries, each
of the pieces either by Botticelli or
a contemporary, or of those that
followed him and were inspired
by him. However, the first section
– with the ORLAN and Yin Xin
works – remains the highlight and
could really carry the exhibition by
itself. It’s certainly worth the price
of entry!
Botticelli Reimagined is on at the
V&A until July 3rd
Tickets from £10.
