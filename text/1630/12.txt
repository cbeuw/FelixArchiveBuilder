e need to end the
deafening silence
– Robbie Lawlor
is the charming
charismatic Mr Gay Ireland. A
Zoology graduate with the kind
of accent romcom producers
ditch their fiancées and invest in
fisherman jumpers to be with. He’s
also HIV Positive. That shouldn’t
matter. Except it does.
“When I was diagnosed I didn’t
know anyone with HIV in Ireland. I
didn’t even know Ireland had HIV”.
Brian knows only too well the
consequences of living with HIV.
After his parents died he went to
live in an orphanage from the age of
six. Not long after his skin started
peeling, he started getting too sick
to go to school but when the doctors
told him he was HIV positive he
jumped around the room with joy.
“I heard ‘positive’. I thought that
has to be good!”
Brian didn’t take his medication
for a year but one day he walked into
school to find all his classmates eyes
on him. Lined above the blackboard
was his whole supply of unopened
medication, when asked why he
had them Brian openly revealed
his status. The school asked him to
leave.
Now, Brian is 22 and lives in
Uganda and, despite everything,
campaigns actively for an end to
HIV. These two brave speakers,
standing in front of me right now,
laying all the most intimate details
of their personal lives bare to a room
full of strangers, are only too aware
that if their lives were reversed
Robbie would be dead.
The reason for this is the
medication. In Uganda, there are
only two lines of HIV medication,
atripla and prezista, for those that
can afford it. Atripla is known for
causing such crippling side effects
including mental delusions that it
is recommended only to be taken
at night. For Robbie it was the high
of LSD followed by being hit by a
truck the next morning and it was
deadening.
“It was a family meal two weeks
after starting atripla and I was so
exhausted I couldn’t even physically
lift my arm. I told my mum that if
Speaking against Stigma
it was this versus living two years
more I’d take the two years. She
rushed me to the clinic.”
Luckily in Ireland Robbie had the
option of Prezista and for a while
everything seemed great. That is,
until his kidneys started to fail.
“They told me on Prezista I’d have
six months to two years”
But there was a new drug just out
that sounded perfect, one pill a day.
The only trouble was for less than
10% of the population it was fatal.
“Of course I fell into that percent
because it’s me” .
Robbie is now on his fourth line
of medication. Brian takes atripla.
The reason these two and others
have travelled the breadth of the
country speaking out about HIV
is the hope to change all of this.
They are part of YouthSTOP
AIDS and this tour hopes to break
down the stigma surrounding
HIV and highlight the charity’s
#MissingMedicines Campaign.
Josie, 24, one of the speakers, not
there that evening,has drug resistant
TB. In the last 50 years there have
only been two new drugs to treat
Tuberculosis but 15 developed to
target Hay Fever. 1.5 million die of
TB each year but when the majority
affected are in poor or middle
income countries the incentive to
develop new drugs is just not there.
In response to this,MSF launched
its Access Campaign in 1999 after
finding the medicines they needed
in humanitarian crises overpriced
or out dated. Their target for now
is the pneumonia vaccine. The kind
of disease we tend to associate with
the infirm or very old, pneumonia
is the leading cause of infectious
childhood death worldwide and at
the moment only two companies
produce the vaccine.
Today it costs 68x more to
Imperial atThe Notting Hill Dinner Club
T
wo weeks ago, the Union
put on a whole load of
student volunteering
opportunities as part of
the national campaign of Student
Volunteering
The Student Development team
from Imperial College Union
worked closely with the Notting
Hill Community Church to get
students involved in the evening as
part of Student Volunteering Week.
SVW is a nationwide campaign
designed to get more students
involved in volunteering in the
UK. It also involves celebrating
the impact of student volunteers
in their communities, which the
Union took part in via the Great
Volunteer Thank You scheme. I got
a postcard, it was great.
The Notting Hill Dinner Club
involves opening Notting Hill
Community Church up for anyone
who may be in need of food,
friendship or just a helping hand
in life. Much more than simply a
free three course meal, the Diner
Club exists to offer hope, light and
love to the people of Notting Hill
and London. The church is always
happy to have food donations for
the evening.
As part of SVW, 34 Imperial
students headed over, with both
‘Take Note’ A Cappella Group and
Imperial College Gospel Choir
making an appearance to sing for
the attendees., creating a friedly
relaxed atmosphere. The Imperial
students helped out and chatted
with the guests. Everyone was able
to talk about a huge variety of topics
because of the range of students and
people there.
“Imperial College students made
a huge difference attending the
Dinner Club; their welcoming and
engaging attitude with the guests
was fantastic and really helped
break down social barriers.We hope
to continue working closely with
the Dinner Club in the future.” said
Lucinda Sandon-Allum, Imperial
College Union President.
Overall it was a really lovely
opportunity to get more involved
in the local community. Student
Volunteering Week seems to
have gone as well as ever this year,
excellent news for a campaign in its
fifteenth year.
ABIGAIL DE BRUIN
vaccinate a child in developing
countries than it did in 2001 and
almost half of that cost is due to
the high price of the pneumonia
vaccine. In 2015, 60 countries spoke
out against the high prices at the
World Health Assembly but the
current lowest global price is still
$10 per vaccine.
MSF are calling for that to be
halved and with the Indian Serum
Institute bringing out the vaccine
for $6 next year we know this is
doable. A key aim of the Access and
#MissingMedicines campaign is
transparent pricing. Currently drug
companies have no obligation to
reveal what is charged for vaccines
in each country which leads to
situations where Morocco is charged
more than France or MSF is offered
the pneumonia vaccine for $26 and
$46 during South Sudan’s global
health crisis in 2013 despite it being
known that the lowest global price
is $10.
Robbie and Brian know they are
only two voices in a complex world
but already things are starting
to change. Robbie has found the
7000 other people living with HIV
in Ireland and they now have a
support network and campaign for
government accountability with
regards to HIV. “When the doctor
said to me, ‘Do you think you can
turn HIV into an opportunity?’ I
turned to him and said ‘What?!
You’re crazy!’”
But Brian has done just that.
“I’ve toured the whole of the UK
and in every room there are the
young people of the UK who are
bright and have so much energy.
They have the power to change
things”. He’s talking about you.

B
etween the 26th
and the
28th
of February, Imperial
had the opportunity to
host the largest European
Model United Nations conference.
Over 1500 delegates from all around
the world came to Imperial to debate
the current political, humanitarian
and health issues the international
community faces. ICMUN seized
the opportunity to send its own
members to participate in this
conference: London International
Model United Nations conference
(LIMUN).
If you find yourself confused;
Model United Nations is a forum
within which delegates represent
a country in a United Nations
committee and work with other
delegates to address an international
issue. During the past weekend,
our members were able to agree
on solutions for the situations
on the eastern border of Turkey,
antibiotic resistance, establishing an
international digital currency and
many more issues.
Our members once again
proved that Imperial deserves to
be ranked among the best MUN
Societies in the UK. Our impressive
achievements include:
Under-Secretary General for
Chairing- Aditya Ranjan
Eight Directors of committees:
Justus Lobler (Securty Council),
Dijana Spasenoska (UNICEF),
Chris Whitehouse (UNDP),
Nil Bozkurt (ECOFIN), Milia
Hasbani (WHO), Shiladitya
Gosh (SOCHUM), Lalit Maganti
(Crisis), Michail Chatzis (G20).
Furthermore, we sent 15 delegates
who fiercely fought for their views,
and worked hard on drafting
resolutions. Special congratulations
are in order for our award winner:
Vincent Seabag (Diplomacy
Award), Aya Sakamoto and Xuan
Chen (Best Position Paper),
Tobias Paulus and Saad Ahmed
(Honourable Mention).
Even though we worked we also
had time for fun.We attended a ball
at the Grand Connaught Rooms,
danced to Macarena, sang Hello,
and came up with cringe worthy
puns. Here is our favourite:
China loves its tea. We like
our black tea, we like our green
tea, but most of all we love our
SovereignTEA.
If you are interested in the United
Nations and how it works feel free
to come along to one of our sessions
on Thursdays from 18:00 – 20:00
in Skemp 307. No prior MUN
