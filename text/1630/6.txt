Elections 2016: Mates or Manifestos?
There have been few opportunities for candidates to show what they really stand for

L
ast week, Theresa Davey
wrote an interesting article
about the nature of union
elections and how they
are, essentially, a popularity contest.
This is a real danger associated
with student elections when, due
to the short election period, it is
difficult for the candidates with well
thought-out policies to be separated
from those looking for a cushy job.
It therefore falls to media to assist
the electorate in deciding who the
fakes are.
Meet The Candidates was
supposed to take on this role,but was
interrupted by technical difficulties,
leaving candidates a disappointing
2 minutes to talk about why they
should be elected. It was therefore
planned for an ICradio show
(yes, Imperial has a radio station)
to interview these presidential
candidates in an extended format,
allowing them time to expand on
their views. This would have been
a great step towards giving the
candidates the accountability they
all claim to want.
When the prospect of the show
was broached to candidates they
rightly expressed concerns about the
potential bias and the supposedly
poor tone taken by the show’s hosts.
The union was rightly involved and
agreed that as long as the hosts
showed no bias the show would go
ahead.The show was then given the
union’s blessing, with advertising
featured on the twitter pages of the
current Union President and the
union itself.
Whether the host would have
provided bias or not we will
never know, as around half of the
candidates dropped out with 57
minutes’ notice, resulting in the
show’s cancellation and unsavoury
internet bickering from both sides.
The way the whole thing turned
out was rather disappointing.
In my mind it was unprofessional
for the candidates to drop out of a
commitment so late, and it quashed
a great opportunity for them to
show their substance.
The social media feeds of the
presenters has hardly helped
their claims of impartiality, with
messages before and after justifying
and confirming the fears of the
candidates who later withdrew.
It is annoying that what could
have been an interesting show
providing a great insight into who
does and doesn’t have what it takes
fell into a silly high school-esque
flame war that just made everyone
look foolish. Looks like we’ve got
the beauty contest we were worried
about before all this began.
