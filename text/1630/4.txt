is dead, perhaps you should
reconsider because there’s one
right on our doorstep, at 221
Brompton Road, just a few streets
from Harrods.
The former sushi restaurant, now
pop-up community centre, has been
open for just over a week but will
probably be boarded back up by
Saturday, after being served eviction
papers.
The squat is an initiative of the
Radical Housing Network, self-
identified as a “network of groups
fighting for housing justice, based
in London”. The space, which must
be constantly occupied to stave off
eviction, has been turned into a
warm and welcoming social hub
aiming to spread the word.
“We’re using this building to
draw attention to the housing crisis.
We’re in one of the richest parts in
London which is one of the richest
places of the world and there’s
massive inequality here. There’s
loads of really expensive properties
which are left empty so someone
can make money out of them, while
there’s lots people who don’t have a
home at all”, says Christine, one of
the network’s members.
Within you can find a pillowcase
banner making station, a calendar
filled with events ranging from
poetry nights to academic lectures,
a children’s play area and even a
counter stocked with food reclaimed
from skips. The rest of the space
is covered with flyers, banners and
signs and filled with the soft buzz of
friendly conversation.
The squat can accommodate
as many as 40 people at a time,
mainly from the Radical Housing
Network but the initiative is aimed
at a wider audience. As put by
Christine, “Unless you’re really rich
in London, you are affected by the
housing crisis… You might not be
sleeping on the streets but you still
don’t have anything that you can call
Lef Apostolakis

a home”.
The network will be marching
on Sunday the 13th
of March to
protest a new housing bill aiming at
finishing off social housing.
Check out a film on the matter
made by Imperial science media
production students on our website.
Presidential Candidates boycott IC Radio debate
Four candidates decided not to show after “aggressive” emails and “extreme
dissatisfaction”
A
debate between Union
President Candidates
that was due to be held
on IC Radio on Tuesday
night was scuppered after four
candidates decided to boycott the
show an hour before it went on air.
The show, which initially raised
eyebrows after one of the presenters
had been on one candidate’s
campaign team,was later sanctioned
by the union’s returning officers.
The presenter in question removed
all promotional material for the
candidate, whose campaign video
he had featured in the week before,
from his social media and promised
to hold a fair and unbiased debate.
The deputy returning officer then
okayed the show.
57 minutes before the debate was
due to begin, the hosts received an
email, which they later read out

A
female Muslim student
had her niqab pulled off
by two men outside the
King’s Strand campus
last Friday.
Bystanders said the men, not
thought to be students, approached
the students’ stall and started using
racially aggravated language before
throwing leaflets over their stall.
They then asked why the women:
“Why are you wearing that on your
face?”Before pulling a veil off of one
of them.

King’s Student has niqab ripped off
One student said the men had
been “looming” and “being very
aggressive” before the incident.
The students had been running
a stall as part of Discover Islam
week, and were giving out Islamic
literature as part of this.
According to bystanders, King’s
security were unresponsive to the
ongoing incident, and the police
were only called when the same
men started to hassle a white animal
rights activist.
King’s College have said in
a statement that “two security
managers and a senior member
of staff arrived on the scene and
positioned themselves between both
parties and attempted to defuse the
situation” before calling the police,
who arrived 40 minutes later.
The two men were then arrested
under Section 4 of the Public Order
Act and later released on bail.
The university says they have
given CCTV footage of the area to
the police.
The King’s Islamic Society later
released an open letter to the
university Principal, criticising both

University Challenge team out
M
onday’s edition of
University Challenge
saw the Imperial
team lose any chance
of winning the tournament.
Despite a good effort from
the lads, Liverpool managed to
beat them 185-130 in the show’s
quarter-finals.
Imperial Bezer, once the darling
of Twitter, was no longer the main
attraction online either.The internet
was rather distracted by Liverpool’s
Bretherton, a medic who had
viewers swooning. The next day, the
Daily Mail was asking whether he
was University Challenge’s “best-
looking contestant” and appealing
for information on his whereabouts.
The Imperial team will return
soon to battle it out for their final
position in the competition.

on air. John Golden, Cat Stuttard,
Eddy Kardouss and Levi Ordog
had decided not to come, because
the show would have grouped
candidates with “grossly different
aims”. This was presumably because
the show’s runners had planned to
group the Presidential candidates
in groups of three. The dissenting
group also described the presenters’
previous emails to them as
“bordering on aggressive”.
The presenters then complained
on air that they had spent an
“unspeakable” amount of time
working on the show’s questions,
calling the candidates involved in
the boycott “unprofessional”.
The presenters told the remaining
candidates: Nas Andriopoulos,
Melody Ball and Ivan Brown that
the others wouldn’t be showing up
and that the debate was cancelled.
The show then went on with
only one Presidential candidate
present: Patryk Fryzlewicz, who
was happy to call the incident a
“shambles”, lamenting the struggle
of the presenters and criticising the
candidates who weren’t present.
Yulia Bulgakova,who initially said
she couldn’t come due to illness,
later told the presenters she stood
by the four candidates who had
declined to appear.
They reiterated how they didn’t
think their emails were aggressive,
askedthecandidatestogiveevidence
of this and said the candidates just
didn’t want to debate each other.
The three then wittered on for an
hour about the other candidate’s
manifestos.
After difficulties with the union’s
‘Meet the Candidates’ show last
Wednesday, many have expressed
their dismay at the lack of any
real, challenging hustings this year.
Results will be announced tonight,
in Metric.
The deputy
returning
officer had
okayed the
show
his handling of the incident as one
“focussed only on preserving the
image of the college” and the “lack
of urgency displayed by university
staff”.
They asked the professor for a
statement clarifying his stance on
the protection of Muslim students,
clarification of the university’s
implementation of the Prevent
legislation on campus and “clear and
honest communication” with KCL’s
ISoc to prevent further incidents.
The Muslim students cite previous
incidents,such as the racial profiling
of a Muslim student officer who
was questioned on his way to see a
talk from Desmond Tutu and the
vandalisation of Muslim prayer
room signs.
Statistics continually show that
Muslim women, especially those
who wear religious garments, bare
the brunt of islamophobic attacks.
