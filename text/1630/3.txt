nternational Women’s Day
on Tuesday was marked by
college’s ‘Women@Imperial’
week.
Over the week, Imperial’s official
Twitter and Facebook pages
churned out images and interviews
from women working around
Imperial.
An exhibition celebrating women
has been up in the Business School
entrance all week.It includes images
of female pioneers in Imperial’s
history from the archives, including
the first female graduates and first
professors to hold leading academic
positions in the constituent
departments of the College. Other
featured women include the Union
President, Lucinda Sandon-Allum,
staff from HR, the ICSM, IT and
support services.
At an exclusive invite-only
Women@Imperial reception to
start off the week, the college’s
movers and shakers were invited
to hobnob around the exhibition
on International Women’s Day on
Tuesday. There will be an outreach
event today to encourage young
women to enter STEM.
Last week,the education secretary,
Nicky Morgan, presented a new
report into female leadership.
‘WomenCount: Leaders in Higher
Education 2016’, profiles women
who have been appointed to high
positions in universities, including
our very own President, Alice Gast,
and Vice Provost (Education)
Debra Humphris, who recently left
Imperial for Brighton.

in our universities and colleges act
as powerful role models”. She also
pointed out that Imperial had a
“great example”of a female leader in
the form of Alice Gast, who is the
first female President in Imperial’s
history.
Alice Gast said she had been
“especially inspired by Imperial’s
women”. Aw, thanks Alice.

"...If I don’t give it to you I will
be fine tomorrow. If I don’t give it
to them, I will lose my job. So you
don’t get the court.”
They were told that as their Easter
tournament was a not a BUCS
fixture, they didn’t have priority in
the double booking.
This is not the first time Ethos has
double booked the team. Despite
practicing at the same time every
Saturday since the beginning of
the academic year, their slot has
been given away twice without any
notice. On one occasion, a match
with UCL had been scheduled.
The rivals then had to be sent back,
and the referees reimbursed from
Basketball’s own funds, despite
Sport Imperial’s error.
In response, Sport Imperial had
this to say: “Supporting student
sport is the core of Sport Imperial’s
mission, and we are sorry that our
commitment was not demonstrated
in this case.”
“Following the incident, Grant
Danskine, Acting Head of Sport,
met with the IC Men’s Basketball
Captain and the IC Basketball
Club Chair, together with the ICU
Deputy President for Clubs and
Societies, to apologise and confirm
that student club bookings should
not be cancelled in favour of private
or commercial bookings.”
“A plan was agreed with the
Basketball Club and Imperial
College Union to make sure this
does not happen again in the future.”
Sport Imperial is currently in flux,
as the last head of sport left before a
replacement could be found, leaving
the current operations manager to
take over as acting head.
Ben Howitt, the union’s Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies) said
he was “disappointed and upset
at the rudeness displayed to the
Basketball committee over the
weekend. The event has highlighted
Their slot
has been
given
away twice
without any
notice
some clear retraining needs, and I
will be working with Sport Imperial
and Union staff members to make
sure that incidents like this do not
happen again in the future, and
that clubs have access to the space
required for their activities.”
The Captain of the Men’s 1st
team,
Filippo Baldini told FELIX he’d
asked Sport Imperial “to make the
rules more clear, because at the desk
they never know who’s right or what
to do.”
He went on to say that although
staff from Sport Imperial “sounded
serious about making these changes
... experience keeps me quite
sceptical.”
