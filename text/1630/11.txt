M
any of my friends
will attest to the
fact that my life is a
series of constantly
unfolding dramatic episodes.
From my obsession with Huel
to my passionate hatred of the
Ethos layout, there’s seldom a dull
moment. Indeed, last year my life
reached such a dramatic height
that I was led to believe joining the
Imperial Dramatic Society would
be a good way to meet like-minded
individuals.
However, shortly after signing
up, I discovered to my great dismay
that I had been selected to play a
‘role’ in a ‘stage production,’ and
that DramSoc did not in any way
resemble a group-therapy society of
the Alcoholics-Anonymous type.
Not wanting to lose face, I quietly
feigned acceptance of this turn of
events and applied myself to reading
the prescribed text.
Thankfully the character I had
been cast as, Michael Doyle, is a
simple-minded fireman from New
York with considerable skills in the
woman department. As an Imperial
Aeronautics student from Australia,
I clearly found this character highly
relatable and have had much joy
depicting him and his questionable
intellect in rehearsals to date. It isn’t
all fun and games though!
Being a part of this ‘stage
production’ (which I hear is called
‘The Big Fellah’) has meant a lot
of learning too. In my experiences
thus far I have learned the answers
to many questions that have
deeply troubled me throughout my
childhood and adolescence. For
example; Who is Sinn Fein? Where,
and what actually is Ireland? How
do you pronounce Sinn Fein? What
does it feel like to actually kiss a girl
in real life? Where is MR4 in Beit?
Why are people so racist? IRA?
Thankfully we have a resident
Northern Irishman on hand in the
cast to answer the cultural questions

enth birthday
celebrations are always
the most memorable,
particularly if you’re a
90s baby. Back then, the Spice Girls
were immortal divas and singing
zealously to Sisqo’s ‘Thong Song’
was a social onus. Who can forget
the numbing hours spent designing
paper invitations in Microsoft
Publisher? Who can forget that
inexplicable glee at finding a tube
of Smarties in your party bag?
Gifts then were incredibly humble.
Unwrapping a Tamagotchi could
elicit wild amounts of excitement,
vented through endless puffs into
elaborately coloured party blowers.
Imperial College Gospel Choir’s
(ICGC) 10th
birthday celebration
won’t be quite the same but it will
certainly be unforgettable.
On March 17th
, ICGC will
be marking its 10th
year with its
biggest Easter concert to date.
Gospel choirs from Queen Mary
University, UCL and Kings will be
joining in with the celebrations too.
A collaboration of this size is very
rare. So what has kept ICGC going
all these years? Not many societies
at Imperial live to see ten. Three
ingredients have preserved the
group’s vivaciousness. Firstly, it is
unbelievably open; ICGC members
are one of the most diverse groups
you come across on campus. You’ll
find a professor singing next to a
fresher, and a film student dancing

(no spoilers - come and see the
play to figure out who it is) and the
directors do their part handling the
other ones. I must admit, however,
kissing Hasan in the audition was
a little strange, especially seeing as
he insisted on wearing lipstick (he
claimed he was “method acting”).
Perhaps the best part of being in
It isn’t all
fun and
games
though
DramSoc’s second play of the Spring Term is The Big Fellah
alongside an engineer. Another
thing that keeps the choir going are
their interesting gigs. These have
included the standard wedding
but also an appearance as back-up
singers on the X-factor. Plus, not
many students get to perform on
the London underground or get
invited to sing at the illustrious Ideal
Home show. The final ingredient
is fun and lots of it. As cheesy
as that may sound, being part of
ICGC comes with immensely
amusing experiences. It’s no wonder
generations of students continue to
join the family.
In ten years, ICGC has achieved
amazing things. For instance,
they were finalists four times at
University Gospel Choir of the Year,
the UK’s biggest inter-university
competition. To add to this, they
recently had their first broadcasting
debut on Premier Gospel radio.
Most importantly, the choir now
owns a special set of robes that
beautifully complete their gospel
image and theatrics.
Join the birthday celebrations
on March 17th
at St Paul’s
Hammersmith, with a drinks
reception from 6pm and the
show from 7pm, We will also be
supporting the children’s hospice
charity, Havenhouse as part of our
celebration! Tickets are available on
the union website.

All in all, it’s
been a jolly
good time
for me
this production, however, has been
my discovery of the Café Forum
on Gloucester Road. It has proven
to be an ideal venue for the vibrant
expression of my personal dramas.
Well, either the Café Forum or
the fact that I can now go around
telling people that I play the
‘protagonist’ in the DramSoc play
(no, not Birdland), despite the fact
that Michael mostly sits around in
scenes being stupid and the majority
of his lines are the word “no.”
All in all, it’s been a jolly good
time for me. And, for a small fee,
in this exclusive one-time offer, you
too can experience The Big Fellah!
Simply come to MR3 on the nights
of the 20th, 21st
or 22nd
of March!
Further terms and conditions apply,
