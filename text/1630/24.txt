No, they’re not football teams – FELIX puts two South Ken eateries to the test
I
f there is one thing South
Kensington doesn’t have
a shortage of, it’s Italian
restaurants. FELIX decided
to put two of the more similarly
priced places head to head; the more
rustic and traditional Rocca,and the
modern, do-it-yourself, Loves Fresh
Pasta.
First, we headed to Loves Fresh
Pasta who claim to serve an ‘artisan
country food at a pace that the city
life demands’. Sounds perfect for
budget conscious students, right?
Loves Fresh Pasta is owned by
multi-millionaire David Gold, also
behind the hair extension business
Great Lengths, and his daughter
Jessica Gold. They opened up their
first restaurant in 2013.While it did
look like they were going to become
a chain as they once had two
restaurants in London, the South
Kensington restaurant is currently
the only one.

The restaurant, located directly
opposite South Kensington station,
gives you a glimpse of the future
with the idea to make servers
virtually obsolete. On each table
there is a tablet where you place
your order. Alternatively, you can
order with a waiter in which case a
service charge applies. The ordering
system is very much a “personal
experience” – you get to pick your
pasta and sauce separately from an
extensive but slightly overwhelming
list of options.
We chose the abbracci sauce
(tomato based with cured pork)
and a simple basil pesto. We also
though we might give their pizzas
a try. The pizza menu was slightly
less inspiring, and we opted for half
Hawaiian and half pepperoni.
While you are waiting, you are
given tomato and basil bruschetta
– this was fresh and warm, perfect
to snack on while you wait for your
main course to arrive.
There are three size options for
pasta and we opted for the smallest,
which was kids’ size – a good
lunch option but not priced much
lower than the regular. The pasta
was cooked well in both cases. The
vibrant and fresh tomato sauce
coated the pasta perfectly and
made for a very enjoyable dish. The
pesto sauce on the other hand was
disappointing: too much of it and
swimming in oil.
There’s not much you can say
about bad pizza, and there is even
less you can say about this pizza. It
was in short,unremarkable – copious
amounts of bland stringy cheese,
watery ham and oily pepperoni sat
on top of a too thin, crust-less base.
If you do go to Loves Fresh Pasta,
don’t get the pizza.The servers, who
we saw much more than usual due
to the tablets not working, were
attentive but a little subdued. In a
few words, they were unexceptional.
Next we headed to Rocca, which
on the outside seems like your
bog standard Italian eatery. We
walked in expecting a typical,
nothing to-write-home-about meal,
something we could find on any
high street. In some cases it was,
but from the get go we realised
the homey, traditional restaurant
had something quite distinct. The
hardwood floors and low lighting
gave a cosy and comfortable feel.
The seating was cramped, which we
quickly discovered was due to the
popularity of the restaurant.Despite
this, we managed to procure a table
without reservation. For large
parties at peak hours we definitely
recommend booking in advance, to
avoid disappointment.
Roccaisasmallchain,withanother
restaurant in Dulwich Village. The
restaurant in South Kensington
had a great buzzy atmosphere. The
waiters were friendly, attentive and
quick with suggestions.
Rocca is a fully rounded restaurant,
serving the expected pasta and pizza
as well as having meat and fish
options, though they were slightly
more expensive.
We chose their basil pesto pasta,
mainly to make a direct comparison
between the restaurants. We were
glad we did. A rich, flavourful sauce,
strong with basil, complemented by
crunchy pine nuts, coated perfect,
al dente pasta which left a smile on
our faces.
We ordered the regina pizza which
was topped with mushrooms, olives
and ham. After tasting the pasta,
we certainly had high expectations
and were not disappointed. A thin,
crispy base with a delicious fluffy
crust, was garnished abundantly
with the highest-quality toppings,
all in perfect balance.
There is a comprehensive
selection of typical Italian desserts
at reasonable prices. On a prior visit
one of the writers had tiramisu. It
was a decently large portion,creamy,
but was otherwise unremarkable. In
South Kensington there are many
great dessert places with similar
prices, so if you’re looking for
something a bit more interesting it
might be best to skip dessert here.
Both restaurants had their pros
and cons, the namesake in Loves
Fresh Pasta was mainly good and
kudos to them for their futuristic
theme – however, we left feeling
quite disappointed, especially with
the pizza. However, with the 20%
student discount and the very tasty
abbracci pasta we would definitely
suggest you give it a try. Rocca
on the other hand, is perfect for
a comfortable sit down meal. It
has fantastic food, albeit mediocre
dessert. While they do not offer a
student discount, their prices are
very competitive for the area. We
certainly recommend you go there
for a nice catch up with some mates
or a place to go when the family
comes to visit.
