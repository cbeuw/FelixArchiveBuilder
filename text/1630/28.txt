t’s that time of year again.
You’re exhausted, because you
were up way too late watching
the new season of House of
Cards or the latest Better Call Saul;
stressed, because if you were up so
late you should have been finishing
your coursework; and spammed to
Ice Hockey – that notoriously friendly game. Photo Credit: Ice Hockey
Ice Hockey preview their upcoming game against UCL
bursting point because suddenly
everybody wants to be the Union
president.
Also at this exhausting, stressful,
spammy time of year is the London
Ice Varsity!
What better way to break from the
above than to relax rink-side with a
cool beer (non-alcoholic beverages
are available, drink responsibly etc.)
and watch your Imperial Devils
fight their way to victory over the
Yetis of Gower St?
The annual fixture between UCL
and Imperial is one of utter rivalry.
Devils put the Yetis in their place in
the inaugural contest of 2013. Yetis
fought back skew-tooth and yellow-
nail in 2014, but in the end couldn’t
hold on as the game went 4-4
through overtime to a three-round
shootout; culminating in a shot top-
shelf into the Yeti net, and a lunging
poke check from Devils’ netminder
for a 5-4 win. The undefeated reign
came to an end last year, though, in
another close game that swung to
the Yetis’ favour in the third period.
Join us on the evening of Friday
18th
March for the fourth London
Ice Varsity – and support the
Imperial Devils in recovering the
title from UCL!
Tickets are available on the
Union website: http://j.mp/

n Saturday 27th
February Imperial
College’s Synchronised
Swimming Team swam
in the Middlesex Synchronised
Swimming championships,winning
the silver medal in the “Masters
20+” age category.
The team arrived to a slightly
chaotic atmosphere with the entire
leisure centre having just been
evacuated due to a fire alarm. The
sight of swimmers huddled outside
insilverfoilblanketsdidlittletocalm
the nerves but we were determined
to enjoy ourselves regardless.
Despite no hot water or heating,
we had a fantastic time, proudly
displaying our Batman routine to
coach Ambre’s appreciative cheers
from the stands. Given that half of
the team only started the sport in
October of last year,it was a brilliant
result with all swimmers happy with
their performances.
Imperial were the only UK
university competing at this
competition and are actually one
of only two university synchronised
swimming teams in the whole
of the UK (the other being
Aberdeen). This means we often
have to travel abroad to compete.
We have 3 European competitions
coming up - the Open Masters
Championships in Brussels on
20th
March, the French University
Championships in Bordeaux on 31st
March and the Paris International
Tournament on 14th
May. The rarity
of the sport in the UK also means
that we have a very international
team – we currently have swimmers
from France, Portugal, Italy, Spain,
Greece and Taiwan.
Synchronised swimming is
an incredible sport – endurance,
dynamism, grace, and an ability to
Caped crusaders swim to victory
A Batman theme won the syncronised swimmers a silver medal
hold your breath underwater are
just some of the qualities needed.
Swimmers are unable to use the
bottom of the pool, so sculling
and treading water techniques
are essential to avoid sinking. You
only need to watch ‘synchronised
swimming lifts’ on YouTube to
understand the complexity involved
with lifting a swimmer clean into
the air using just leg power against
water. It’s definitely a calorie-
burner!
Imperial is a wonderfully friendly,
sociable and welcoming club. If
anyone wants to give synchro a go or
is just interested in finding out more
about the sport, visit our website
which you can access from Imperial’s
Union website, add us on Facebook
or email syncswim@ic.ac.uk.
