T
hrowing Shade, AKA
Nabihah Iqbal, is an
artist who educates. Her
background in history
and ethnomusicology (in which
she holds a degree from SOAS)
heavily influences her bi-weekly
House of Silk, with iridescent
artwork that reflects the aesthetic
qualities of her music – a hazy
blur of sharp light and colour, like
looking into soap bubbles. Her
music is often described as “cosmic
R&B”and “electro dream-pop”, and
this collection of five tracks with
metaphor-inducing titles stay true
to those labels.
The opening track, ‘hashtag
IRL’, is very PC Music-esque – a
connection which makes sense
considering she was revealed as the
voice of SOPHIE’s ‘Lemonade’
earlier this year. Layers of bored
saccharine vocals spell out internet
acronyms like OMG, LOL, WTF
that have become so ingrained in
our language today. Iqbal describes
this track as a commentary on the
“anti-social reality of social media”,
and the isolated “#please follow me”
at the end perfectly encapsulates the
desperate undertones of internet
culture. However, it feels somewhat
out of place, with the rest of the EP
having a more coherent and gentle
theme.
‘Marble Air’ is a wavy piece with
rippling synths and claps, evoking
images of those iridescent soap
bubbles taking flight. The lack
of a concrete ending gives the
impression of floating aimlessly, and
the track generally has a celestial
quality. ‘Ecco Echo’ features lilting
acid-tinged synths that fade in
and out of each other to create a
dreamy trance-like rhythm, with
clear Eastern influences. ‘Fear of
Silence’ is the perfect continuation
of ‘Ecco Echo’, as we sink deeper
‘Underneath My Eyelids’, where
you feel as though you are gliding
through an other-worldly house
of silk. Like ‘Marble Air’, the track
fades into the void – it doesn’t feel
complete, but then maybe that’s the
point. The listener is left out in the
depths, in a state of calm perplexity.
Although it may not be as
complex as some of her other work,
such as the Fate Xclusive EP from
2015, House of Silk is still a beautiful
embodiment of dreamy synth-pop
from an artist who shows great
promise and versatility.
House of Silk is out now on Ninja
Tune
NTS Radio show, where she
weaves sounds from all over the
world into a culturally rich sonic
tapestry, exploding with colour and
exposing listeners to the “weird and
wonderful”. As well as this, she’s a
producer whose wealth of musical
knowledge shines through in each
of her glittering compositions.
Her new EP released just last
week on Ninja Tune is entitled
into the hypnagogic state. The title
also reminded me of the sentiments
expressed in ‘hashtag IRL’, where
we need to be drowned in social
media noise to avoid the silence of
our supposedly insipid lives. Finally,
the EP closes with the reverbed
chimes and silky humming of
#HotTakes of the Week
Never to be one out of the
headlines, this week Kanye West
described the minimalist, clear
jewel box packaging to his last
album Yeezus as an “an open casket
to CDs r.i.p”. Apparently there will
be no more CDs from him, with all
future releases exclusive to digital
platforms. It’s probably a sensible
Yeezus. Photo Credit: Kanye West

decision from Kanye and allows
him to continue his evolution of
the concept of the ‘album.’ Like the
video game industry, Kanye seeks
to release unfinished or early access
pieces of art, with the ability to
patch and fix his work post-release.
The CD, like all physical mediums,
is dead. It’s time we moved on.

Surprise releases are now a
common occurrence in the music
world.Ratherthanhypingupalbums
for months, artists are deciding to
releasetheirmusicwithoutexpensive
marketing campaigns, with the help
of streaming services like Spotify
and TIDAL. This week, Kendrick
dropped untitled unmastered, a
compilation of unreleased demos
from the same sessions as To Pimp A
Butterfly. While it’s not as polished
(hence the name) and cohesive as
his award-winning record from last
year, the politically-charged and
experimental collection of B-sides is
easily one of the best releases of the
year so far. However, I’m not sure
about the Cee-Lo Green feature
(especially after those awful tweets
last year). The #HotTake EP of the
week – this shit’s on fire!
We want your
#HotTakes!
