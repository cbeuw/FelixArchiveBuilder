Claudia Schulz, a PhD student
in the Department of Computing,
has been awarded Imperial
College’s Best Graduate Teaching
Assistant Award. She hopes that
“showing children what cool tech
jobs are out there and having role
models” is a great way to increase
the number of female scientists.
By becoming a Teaching Scholar
in her department and a Fellow of
the Higher Education Academy
she hopes to be part of that legacy.
Currently her research involves
argumentation precision making.
She is studying the process of
human choice making and to
construct machines that operate
similarly. At the moment ‘Answer
Set Programming’ computes into
structured argumentation ABA\
ASPIC +, however, humans might
not be able to decipher the coding.
So Schulz is hoping to build
machines that can make accurate
decisions and take us through the
decision making process too, which
could help us in decision making.
A
t Sh!t Sc!ence, we
believe that all science
has a purpose, and helps
us better understand
the fascinating world we all live in.
Especially when scientists spend
some time exposing the sexual
deviances of Quebeckers.
Quebec: an anomaly in itself. A
french bastion buried in the frozen
confines where the North American
continent flirts with the arctic circle,
where temperature drops to -17˚C
in the winter, and it snows nine
months out of the year. And that’s a
lot of nights where you need to ward
off the cold.
Science has shown that on a cold
Quebec night, when the moonlight
is bouncing off the freshly fallen
snow, if you listen carefully, you
are likely to hear the soft romantic
sound of a whip cracking in the
distance.

Sh!t Sc!ence
Scientists conclude Quebeckers are pervs
what goes on between the pelts in
the homes of Quebec. And their
results show that Quebeckers are
dirty, dirty boys and girls. Within
the 1,040 test responders, “nearly
half (45.6%) of the sample subjects
were interested in at least one
type of sexual behaviour that is
considered anomalous” says Mr.
Joyal, lead author on the research
paper published in the Journal of
Sex research.
Within these anomalous sexual
behaviours, Quebeckers enjoy, in
decreasing order of preference,
voyeurism, fetishism, frotteurism
and masochism.
I know what you’re thinking…
‘Masochism is an anomalous
sexual behaviour? Mistress Vixen
isn’t going to believe this!’ But
according to the latest edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, which was
published in 2013, sadomasochism
falls under the realm of disorders of
sexual preference, or paraphilia.
Mr. Joyal says that this
research “suggest that we
need to know what normal
sexual practices are before we
label a legal sexual interest as
anomalous.” Demonising these
sexual behaviours by classifying
them as ‘anomalous’ can
ostracise a population which is
carrying out a common sexual
practice.
Until 1973, the DSM
categorised homosexuality as
a paraphilic behaviour, and
treatment to prevent these
sexual urges was recommended.
Criminally, illegal sexual
behaviour in the UK protects
non-consenting adults and
children.
But beyond that, why do we
need to classify ‘disorders’, as
long as the sexual act gives
pleasure to two consenting
adults and doesn’t cause either
of them psychological or
physical harm?
