This week you see a rival
candidate putting his poster
up over yours. You march
over, rip up all of his leaflets,
stick your head in his candy
floss machine and wait for
death’s warm embrace.

This week,you’re the Farmer’s
Market cow.People sit on you
sometimes and take pictures.
Nobody knows that at night
you come alive and provide
the milk for coffees all across
Imperial.
This week, you’re the library
doors. People curse your
slowness constantly and
it gets you down. Nobody
knows that at night you come
alive and open and shut really
quickly, trapping people in
the process, because all you
want is hugs.
This week you’re Maxwells’
Demon. Despite your
disgusting URL, we accept
you as you are.We also advise
you to take an online course
in media law.
This week you’re at the
candidate's hustings. The
stress of campaigning finally
gets to you and you start
shouting over the others, pull
their hats over their eyes so
they can’t see and climb on
the table declaring yourself
sovereign of the union,
emperor of clubs and socs
and king of the cabal.
This week, you’re a woman!
My god,you had no idea.You
are allowed to revel in your
achievements for this week
only. Congratulations. Now
back to International Men's
Every Day.
This week, you’re the statue
of Queen Victoria in the
Business School. Man, you’ve
seen some shit. Nobody
knows that at night you
come alive and tear down
everyone’s campaign posters
and steal yoghurts from
college caf.
This week college decides
to renovate you. Waking up
after a bender at sports night
you find that scaffolding has
been erected around and you
resign to the fact that you’re
going to have your plumbing
completely redone.
This week, you bump into a
normally fierce lab technician
in FiveSixEight. After they
call you a legend and attempt
tobuyyoudrinks,youmanage
to persuade them to hand
over next week’s problem
sheet answers, promising to
introduce them to some fluid
dynamics “babes” in Metric.
This week, you’re Queen’s
Tower. You hate being lit
up blue, and actually find
it heteronormative and
insulting. Nobody knows
that late at night you change
the colour to orange instead
and do cartwheels across
London.
This week, you're the Beit
Quad Cartel. You decide
to take on the IC Radio-
boycotting cabal in a West
Side Story style tap battle
along the streets of South
Kensington. However,
snapping fingers is dangerous,
and your gangs vow to make
peace over curly fries.
This week, you’re college.
Why did you not invite the
Editor to your Women@
Imperial thing? She literally
won’t shut up about it. She
will never not be talking
about not being invited.
Where was her invite? Why?
Did she wrong you? She is
sorry.
