The top three
Oscar winners
who aren’t
Leo DiCaprio
W
ell damn, he did
it. The meme is
dead. 22 years
after his first
nomination, good old Leo has
finally nabbed his long-awaited
Oscar for his leading role in
Alejandro Iñárritu’s epic The
Revenant. Whilst this is good
news, let’s not get carried away in
our celebrations. Why not have a
look at some of the other winners
of the night. Hint: Sam Smith
does not feature.
Ennio Morricone – Best
Original Score
A lot of people on social media
have been raving about this win,
and I just thought I’d add to the
celebrations. For those of you
who don’t know, Morricone is
an Italian composer of over 500
scores, most notably for his work
on Sergio Leone’s Dollars Trilogy.
I think we can all be glad that
recognition has finally come for
his score of Quentin Tarantino’s
phenomenal The Hateful Eight.
Inside Out – Best Animated
Feature
Mark Kermode called this his
favourite film of the year, and for
once I am close to agreeing. This
new instant-classic from Pixar in
many ways revived a company
some people were scared was
losing its way. Following the
release of their first critically
panned film Cars 2, Pixar seemed
to be going down a dangerous
road. Let’s hope the inventive,
emotive power, and downright
charm of Inside Out will usher in
a second Pixar-renaissance
Ex Machina – Best Visual
Effects
The one technical category Mad
Max: Fury Road couldn’t win, the
VFX nominations were stuffed
with big-budget blockbusters.
But I am really pleased to see that
the simple, unintrusive yet near-
perfect realism of Ex Machina
won out – details over flashy stuff
any day.

A rough guide to the Coen brothers
M
y favourite film
industry anecdote is
that Bill Murray only
signed on to be the
voice of porcine feline Garfield in
the 2004 flop because he thought it
was written by Joel Coen, of Barton
Fink, Fargo, and The Big Lebowski
fame. Unfortunately for him, it was
written by another Joel Coen, the
man behind Cheaper by the Dozen.
Now, such a tale may just be a
way for Murray to distance himself
from the film (he did, after all, voice
Garfield in the sequel), but it also
highlights the allure and gravitas
of the Coen brothers. Since their
first feature film, more than thirty
years ago, they have developed
into a brand; a byword for deadpan
humour, genre-busting sensibilities,
and incredibly high-quality
productions.
Joel and Ethan Coen were born
three years apart, in the mid-1950s,
into an academic family from
Minnesota. While Joel went into
film school at New York University,
Ethan earned a philosophy degree
from Princeton; they reunited in
1984 to write
The Unbearable Lightness of Zoe
Saldana
T
elling the story of
turbulent genius Nina
Simone on film was
never going to be easy;
Simone’s life was complex, and
her music beloved by so many that
any casting choice would be liable
to ignite tensions. However, the
controversy upcoming biopic Nina
has stirred up would be enough to
make hardened producers question
their career choices. The issue?
Casting Zoe Saldana, of Avatar
fame, as Simone, which has led
some commentators to argue that
the racism and colourism that
dogged Simone for her whole life
have raised their ugly heads again.
But let’s back up a little here: the
film was first announced in 2010,
with legendary R&B musician
Mary J. Blige stepping into the title
role. Fast-forward to 2012, however,
and Blige drops out – citing financial
reasons – to be replaced by Saldana.
This move was immediately greeted
with anger at the fact that Saldana’s
skin tone was several shades lighter
than Simone’s, and her features
far more European. The release of
photographs a few months later,
which showed Saldana in dark make
-up,only served to deepen the anger.
Since then the controversy has been
quietly bubbling away, but came to
the surface last week, when a new
trailer was released – in the trailer,
Saldana’s skin has been darkened,
and a prosthetic nose attached, in
order to achieve a more realistic
portrayal of the singer. Simone’s
estate hit out at Saldana on Twitter,
telling her to ‘take Nina’s name out
of your mouth. For the rest of your
life.’
So, what’s the issue here? Well,
those criticising the casting choice
claim that the appointment of
Saldana just reflects and reinforces
the colourism present in mainstream
Hollywood, and – indeed – the
whole world. For those among us
who are less woke: colourism,coined
by writer Alice Walker, refers to the
discrimination of people based on
the shade of their skin; it is not the
same as racism, since it does not
rely on the intersection of multiple
factors, such as cultural heritage and
ancestry. Instead, it is the system
that (typically) affords privileges to
those whose skin colour most closely
resembles that of Caucasians.
The effects of the system can
be seen all over the world, from
adverts for skin-lightening creams
in India, to the ‘brown paper bag’
test practiced by certain African-
American fraternities, who would
not let in any individuals whose skin
was darker than a paper bag.
It can be argued that the choice
of Saldana reflects the greater value
society places on light skin. Emma
Dabiri, writing in The Telegraph,
argues that ‘dark skinned women
are so disregarded that they don’t
even deserve to play themselves!’
– a sentiment that is echoed by
Simone’s daughter, who said that
‘appearance-wise, this is not the
best choice’. The problem with the
casting is exacerbated by the details
of Simone’s life: a child prodigy,
she was denied a scholarship to the
Curtis Institute of Music based on
her race; aspiring to be a concert
pianist, she instead had to play in
jazz bars, where she developed her
singing talents; throughout her
career she faced down racism and
colourism, singing songs like ‘To
Be Young, Gifted, and Black’, and
‘Backlash Blues’. Her daughter says
that ‘my mother was raised at a time
when she was told her nose was too
wide, her skin was too dark’ – her
appearance was central to the events
of her life, and many feel the choice
of Saldana does an injustice to her
memory.
Judd Apatow then waded into
the debate, writing ‘I think all
actors should only be allowed to
play themselves. It is offensive to
pretend to be other people’ in a
tweet dripping with sarcasm.Queen
Latifah echoed this sentiment,
saying ‘I don’t see why [Saldana]
shouldn’t play the role’. They reflect
an oft-used counterargument to the
claims above: that acting always
involves pretending to be other
people, and that the appearance
of the actor shouldn’t relate to the
individual they are playing: thus
we have straight actors playing gay
characters, cis actors playing trans
characters, and Emma Stone can
play a Chinese-Hawaiian woman.
However, the details of Simone’s
life make it difficult to allay the
concerns raised by Saldana’s casting.
With her skin colours, and African
features defining others’ attitudes to
her music,shaping the current of her
life, the producers could have made
a better choice – an actor who better
resembles Simone, such as Viola
Davis, or Uzo Aduba, for example.
Lupita Nyong’o has spoken about
her insecurities with her skin tone,
which were shattered when she
saw model Alek Wek: ‘I couldn’t
believe that people were embracing
a woman who looked so much like
me,as beautiful.’Choosing to black-
up a light skinned actor, giving her
a prosthetic nose, just reinforces the
message Hollywood sends out to
dark skinned individuals: that they
are not allowed to tell the narrative,
not even their own.

and direct Blood Simple, their first
feature film, a low budget neo-noir
flick that garnered them critical
praise, catapulting them onto
the world stage. It marked the
film debut of Joel’s wife, Frances
McDormand, as well as one of
the first roles for Holly Hunter, a
former roommate of McDormand;
Blood Simple was the beginning
of a lengthy career in the industry
for both the brothers, one that
would be marked by a frequently
rotating cast of collaborators, many
of whom went onto become big
names themselves. McDormand
and Hunter have both since won
Academy Awards, and Blood Simple
was also the debut score of musician
Carter Burwell,who was nominated
this year for his soundtrack to Carol.
The brothers followed this up
with Raising Arizona (1987), a
black comedy starring Hunter
and Nicholas Cage, and Miller’s
Crossing (1990), a gangster drama
set during prohibition. However,
it was their fourth film, Barton
Fink (1991), that really saw their
careers take off. Telling the tale of
a young Hollywood screenwriter
in the 1940s, Barton Fink takes a
sharp look at the ‘golden age’ of
the film industry; combining
aspects of horror,
noir, and comedy, Barton Fink
is completely unclassifiable, and
cemented the directors’ reputations
as genre-busters. A commercial
failure, Barton Fink swept the board
at Cannes, netting the Palme d’Or,
Best Director, and Best Actor
prizes; the festival since adopted a
rule limiting the number of possible
awards to two per film. It was also
nominated for three Academy
Awards.
Their next film, The Hudsucker
Proxy (1994), received mixed
reviews, but they bounced back
with their 1997 masterpiece Fargo.
A comedy laced with bitterly dark
elements, Fargo tells the story of
Marge Gunderson (McDormand),
a heavily pregnant police chief from
North Dakota who investigates a
number of homicides. Fargo marked
the first Academy Award wins for
the brothers, who took home a Best
Screenplay, and the Best Actress
award for McDormand. It also
marked the second Cannes win
for Best Director. Since then, the
film, and particularly it’s use of the
‘Minnesota nice’ stereotype, have
gone down in cult cinema history.
The brothers followed it up next
year with The Big Lebowski
(1998), which many consider
to be their greatest film; a
surreal stoner comedy, The Big
Lebowski features Jeff Bridges
on top form as Jeff ‘the Dude’
Lebowski, who gets embroiled in
a crime caper against his will.While
it received good reviews when
released, The Big Lebowski touched
a nerve with many people, who
consider it to be their favourite Coen
brothers’film; it has since spawned a
festival in its honour,had two spider
species named after it,and led to the
foundation of a religion – Dudeism
– that has a quarter of a million
ordained priests.
The brothers then took on a
number of projects, including O
Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000),
The Man who Wasn’t There (2001),
Intolerable Cruelty (2003), and The
Ladykillers (2004). However, it was
2007, after a three year break from
the screen, that saw the brothers
on top form again, with the release
of No Country for Old Men. A
straight up neo-Western, this tense
thriller had audiences at the edge
of their seats, following the story of
Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who
ends up on the wrong side of cattle-
gun wielding killer Anton Chigurh,
played to icy perfection by Javier
Bardem. A critical and commercial
success, the film picked up four
Academy Awards: Best
Picture, Best
Director, Best
A d a p t e d
Screenplay,
and Best
Supporting
Actor – which made Bardem
the first Spanish actor to win the
accolade.
Since this success, the brothers
have taken a shot at CIA spy
films (Burn After Reading –
2008), suburban black comedy
(A Serious Man – 2009, featuring
the astonishing and criminally
underrated Michael Stuhlbarg),
classic Western (True Grit – 2010),
and folk-revival drama (Inside
Llewyn Davis – 2013).
While other major international
directors, such as Michael Haneke,
may take one mood, and repeatedly
modulate it through their careers,
the Coen brothers show the
importance of never standing still.
Bouncing around from genre to
genre, they have never settled on a
single one, and yet have made their
indelible mark on modern cinema;
combining an ADHD-esque
interest in all things cinematic
with a dead seriousness about their
work, the world of film is better off
thanks to this masterful duo. We
can definitely sympathise with Bill
Murray.
