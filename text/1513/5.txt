MEANWHILE, ON THE QUEEN’S LAWN
On Tuesday at Lunchtime, Rector Sir Keith O’Nions was ambushed by RAG, who had conveniently prepared a number of actual borderline-edible cream pies earlier that day.
Having successfully evaded one pie-er, the Rector was hit with an upper-cut, fatally covering him with cream.
However, at this point the tables were turned and Sir Keith somehow gained one of his own and turned on the RAG chair, who thought that bending over and shoving his face into it
would prevent it from going onto his clothes. He was mistaken.
On the bright side, RAG Week is coming up, with Amnesty Society taking over the pub quiz, a pub-crawl to Piccadilly Institute (with cheap entry), a dodgeball competition, a hog roast
and a Metric night. Promises to be a crazy one.
