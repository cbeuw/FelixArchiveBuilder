n total, 96 respondents said
that they had been involved
in a threesome. First thing
to note is that 96 is divisible
by three, so it is possible
they were all Imperial threesomes,
although we cannot confirm or deny
this fact. We didn’t ask about any
larger groups of people, although
the comments box at the end could
have been used to tell us (or brag
about) your experiences.
Sexuality and gender
Out of those who said they had
had a threesome, 54 were hetero-
sexual, 19 were homosexual, and
23 were bisexual. This information
can be seen in the pie chart below.
Unfortunately, we didn’t get to find
out what combination of gender
the threesomes were. However, we
can tell you that. of the people that
claimed to have been in a three-
some, 61 were male and 32
were female.
Asking for
threesomes
In terms of asking for
threesomes: well, let’s
just say, not everyone
got their wish. 136 peo-
ple admitted to asking for
a threesome. That leaves 40
people hastily trying to pre-
tend that they were only jok-
ing. Of the 136, 103 were
male and 32 were female.
This can be seen in the in-
fographic on the right. The
keen mathematicians amongst
you will be able to spot that
those numbers don’t add up.
That’s because of the
“don’t wish to say” option
that was available in all
the questions. However,
the statistics do clearly
show that men were
more willing to ask for
a threesome, or, at very
least, more willing to ad-
mit to Felix that they asked
for a threesome.
Been asked
When it comes to being
asked, it seemed a lot of
people have. In fact, way more have
been asked than have asked. 256
were found to have been asked
for a threesome. Again, looking at
the number that actually followed
through, it seems there were a
lot of awkward silences.
The split this time was
much more even. In
fact, more men were
asked than women.
131 men, compared to
121 women, said that
they’d been asked,
with the remaining
4 not wishing to dis-
close their gender.
Breakdown by
subject
The subject chart
speaks for itself really.
This is starting to feel
like the oddest lab report
in history. If I turn this
into my supervisor, would
this count as progress for
science? Yeah, fine, I’ll do
that. It turns out Physics
is the most prone to three-
somes, or lying. 14 people
said that they had partici-
pated in a threesome. Life
Science and Chemistry are
joint second. Possibly a
combination of the two.

I love talking about sex: sex is one
of my favourite subjects. I think the
sex survey is excellent, because it
brings a topic that is often taboo
and kept quiet in the Anglo Saxon
world to very bright daylight, and I
think that’s a wonderful thing. For
example, the fact that some people
have over 30 sex toys is okay, and
it’s also good for people to know
that it’s okay. For people who are
reticent about getting their very
first sex toy are encouraged and
normalised and made to know that
it’s not that weird.
People’s attitudes towards sex
can have a massive impact on
their lives. Some use sex to boost
their self esteems, which can be
dangerous, whilst others can try to
use it to hold on to their partners,
which obviously leads to a separate
set of complications. Sex should
never be used as a tool, though
unfortunately it often is. A healthy
attitude to sex is important, and
an understanding of your rights,
that it’s always OK to say no, for
whatever reason, is critical. If
someone doesn’t respect you for
saying no, they definitely won’t
respect you for saying yes.
