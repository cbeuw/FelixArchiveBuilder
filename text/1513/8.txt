The Faculty Union Presidents speak
How have you improved the RCSU
since last year?
The biggest thing that’s improved this
year has been The Science Challenge.
Thanks to Paul Beaumont’s work as
Science Challenge Chair we’ve man-
aged to secure sponsorship and really
revive the event from last year.
What’s a day as the RCSU president
like?
Studying part-time and organising
RCSU events full-time.
Why should people get involved with
the RCSU?
Getting involved in either the RCSU or
one of the departmental societies is not
only a great CV boost but it also means
you meet a tonne of new people, make
loads of new friends and get a few free
tickets for events.
What’s been the highlight of your
year so far?
Sitting on the stage on commemora-
tion day and watching a bunch of my
friends graduate right in front of me
was probably the highlight of Imperial
so far.
Do you feel the faculty union presi-
dents should be sabbaticals too?
Personally I don’t think the RCSU
President really needs to be a sab-
batical position. Maybe in a few years
time that’s something which should be
considered, but right now the role isn’t
large enough to be a sabbatical.
Why wasn’t CGCU involved in your
ICSM v RCSU pub quiz?
We did ask them if they wanted to be
involved and they didn’t get back to
us.
When will we see more collaboration
with the CGCU?
We’ve got our Tri-Union Boat Party
coming up on March 14th which is
with both the RSM and CGCU.
What’s been the key to ensuring the
success of the string of events you’ve
held this year?
Planning them early and ensuring
they’re good value for money I think
has been the key.
Is RCSU really the only unpaid fac-
ulty president?
There are only three faculty union’s,
the RCSU, the CGCU and the IC-
SMSU and of these the ICSMSU is
a sabbatical position and the CGCU
President receives some money for
their work. The RCSU President tra-
ditionally does significantly more than
the CGCU President, but is completely
unpaid. To be honest though I don’t re-
ally think it should be a paid position.
How have you delivered on your
manifesto points so far?
My main manifesto point was to bring
back the RCSU beer festival, which we
did at the RCSU Oktoberfest last term.
This wasn’t quite on the scale I’d have
liked but with the Union’s new respon-
sible drinking policy it was really the
best we could do. Hopefully this will
become a yearly event and will be
something next years committee can
build on.
What would you say to people in-
tending to run for your role?
The main thing I’d say is to think about
whether you think you can spare the
time. It really is a big commitment but
easily the best thing I’ve done in my
four years at Imperial.
This year’s Imperial College Union elections include Faculty Union Presidents in
the line-up for the first time. Felix speaks to the outgoing officers
Luke Kanczes –
Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) President
What do you find most interesting
about your role?
The most interesting part of being in
this role is the opportunity to meet with
lots of different people. It is amaz-
ing to have the opportunity to discuss
ideas with Directors of Undergradu-
ate Studies, Heads of Departments
and sometimes with the Principle and
even the Rector! This role also allows
you to meet with distinguished alumni
within the vast C&G network. I have
been learning an enormous amount
from talking with them and I benefit
hugely from it.
How have you improved the CG-
CU’s presence at college?
We produced 1,000 CGCU handbooks
this year to educate students about
CGCU, our traditions and embrace
our identity as Imperial Engineers. In
addition to that, the executive commit-
tee, the dep reps and dep soc chairs
have organised short 30 minute long
lectures at the beginning of the year in
each engineering department to inform
students who the reps are and what we
do.
Do you feel the CGCU’s run events
more competitively against the
RCSU this year?
Yes, most certainly. In addition to the
traditional events, such as club nights
at Archangel and the London Brighton
run, the flagship freshers’ event – the
Welcome dinner at Café de Paris was
bigger and better than ever before.
We had a fantastic attendance of more
than 600, supported by students and
staff, testing the capacity of 700. This
event marked a start of a series of fan-
tastic events and this is something that
the CGCU is determined to carry on
- to bring better and more affordable
events to the engineering students.
Does the rivalry between faculty
unions extend to the CGCU offices?
A significant part of the competitive
rivalry originates from Mascotry. For
those who are not familiar with the
topic, the practice of Mascotry re-
volves around stealing the mascot of
our rivals which include the Medics,
Scientist and Miners. Then holding
them for ransom where the money is
given to RAG.
A popular location of the Mascots
hiding place is inside their respective
union’s office. The CGCU exec com-
mittee has to keep an eye out for sus-
picious scientist and miners lurking
outside the CGCU office!!
What’s an average week like in the
CGCU office?
A typical week largely consists of rep-
resenting the engineering students at
lots of different areas: academically,
professionally and socially to the col-
lege, union, alumni bodies and exter-
nal companies. This comes in in the
form of lots of scheduled meetings and
calls. In these meetings, I voice the
students’ views on important topics
and discuss and decide the engineering
faculty union’s position on the matter.
I am also responsible to manage with
admin requests from the CGCU man-
agement group, i.e. requests from en-
gineering departmental societies and
engineering clubs on a daily basis.
Why should people get involved
with the CGCU?
If you have always wondered what it’s
like to be involved in such a successful
organisation and to be involved with
the organisation of huge events then
this is your chance! It is great fun to
be on the committee and is a really
rewarding challenge. Especially those
in 1st and 2nd years don’t be shy to
apply!
What advice would you give to
someone who was thinking of run-
ning for a CGCU position?
CGCU is by far the biggest faculty
out of the three and as President you
are ultimately responsible for approxi-
mately 6,000 students, 44% of Imperi-
al. The President must ensure the large
executive committee is run smoothly
through regular meetings, and they
should try to get the most out of exec
members. As President you oversee
all of the different subsections of the
committee including events, industrial
relations, alumni relations, finance,
engineering representation and sport.
This means that the President will be
heavily involved with all aspects of
the faculty union from securing and
managing relationships with sponsors
and companies, arranging contractual
agreements for events, budgeting and
maintaining a strong relationship with
the college, union and alumni. The role
requires a natural leader who is very
good at building strong relationships
and managing their time effectively, it
is very demanding however extremely
rewarding and a great honour which
opens doors for you!
