FELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 7
man. However I have always felt the
important part of that process is not
to regret and overthink things, but to
walk through the process, ensure you
learn lessons and disseminate that wis-
dom.
Do you feel that publicising your
achievements is in some ways a dif-
ficulty?
It has always been, and will always
be, difficult to champion the personal
successes and Union successes. How-
ever I do feel I have made it a little
easier.
One of the first things I did, after
securing funding for the benches and
new bins in the quad and getting it
repaved, was to request a better Sab-
batical Blogging system. It looks bet-
ter, it’s easy to use and provides a great
platform to talking about successes we
have had.
I am also creating and soon to release
a Union Impact Report, which will be
called ‘The Review.’ This is designed
to publicise the wider impacts that the
Union and its activities have; all in one
convenient location.
What tends to be the problem is that
some of our achievements are hard to
communicate easily. Securing a seat
at the Strategic Education Commit-
tee, something we have been trying
to do for 8 years, means very little to
the average student even though the
effects being large – this is the Com-
mittee which saw the Life Science
Restructure plans first! And what ends
up happening is you weigh up whether
it’s better to spend a large amount of
your time championing what we have
done, explaining its importance, etc. or
just getting on with achieving more for
the Students. And often, but not all the
time, the primary wins.
F: Do you feel that the Union could
have benefited at all from taking a
definite standpoint on student pro-
tests earlier this year?
S: It is my belief that we didn’t voice
our disapproval enough about the cuts
to UK Science Funding last year; es-
pecially as its effects on our PhD stu-
dents and the University funding has
been significant.
However I think it is fair to say a
lot of our student body, especially the
Student Council, has not been eager to
take to the streets over these changes.
What I will say is that we, as a
Union, have never really considered
whether we should use our voice to
support national campaigns that don’t
overly affect us. A prime example of
this is the EMA cut.
F: What is your stance on Claypo-
nds?
S: I am still very disappointed with the
College for their underhand approach
to the Clayponds closure. This was an-
other example of where the Manage-
ment Board makes a decision and then
realises the effects afterwards. For
example, nobody has thought about
the wardening structure that exists in
Clayponds and whether this will move
to Orient House; nobody has worked
out the prices for this accommodation
to ensure that we still have cheap ac-
commodation options for our PG stu-
dents and nobody consulted the Union
until after the decision was made!
After this I pushed hard to ensure
that the Union guarantees input into
MB decisions which we feel affects
students; not what College believes
does. I raised this at College Council
and the concession I received was that
the meeting agenda and papers will be
made available to the Union for com-
ment before their meetings.
Though this will provide some good
Union oversight it still doesn’t guar-
antee us a voice in the room.
What I do find comical about this
whole situation is that it is the Union
reminding the College that it should
consider the risks of its actions and
assess the effects of its decision be-
fore making them – many people I am
sure would imagine it would be the
reverse!
F: What is your stance on the Hol-
land Club?
S: As I stated earlier in this interview,
this situation is a complete PR disaster
for the College and another situation
that unnecessarily blew out of propor-
tion.
When this was brought to the
Union’s attention in January I stated to
Felix that my priorities were to make
sure that the Students had a seat at the
table and that any space designated for
students would have to be influenced
and managed by students.
This week it was confirmed by the
College that the plans are moving
forward and a task group has been
formed. It is made up of three people:
the member of the Holland Club com-
mittee, a Senior Dean and myself.
One thing that is essential is that
any changes to this space do not deter
people from using it. There is no gain
to any student or staff member of this
College if a popular social space is
changed into an area that no one wants
to use.
We were aware that the PRB meet-
ing would take place last Friday but
the Union was informed that it could
not attend. As such we submitted a
document. I stated, clearly, that we
would welcome a space that could be
provided to PGT students which they
could call their own and that we had
concerns about accessibility. I also
highlighted that we had no issues with
the Holland Club’s Bar area but felt
that the under-utilized snooker and
meeting rooms could be used more ef-
ficiently in a campus which is so des-
perate for space.
F: Why should people be interested
in running for President?
S: This is a question I get asked fre-
quently and there is one simple an-
swer: to make a difference. My role is
the most varied of the Sabbatical team
and it has lots of scope to make it your
own. When I started I never imagined
doing half of the things I have done
and I have enjoyed every minute of it.
There really is nothing more satisfy-
ing that improving the University ex-
perience for the student body.
And next year is going to be a really
interesting year. We will have the first
year of students paying the £9,000
fee entering the University; you can
guarantee there will be a new govern-
ment policy to respond to and the City
is hosting the Olympics. It certainly
won’t be a boring time!
F: What advice would you give to
someone who was thinking of run-
ning for President?
S: Stop thinking – start doing!
