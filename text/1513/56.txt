T
he BUCS 4s and 8s Head
on the River Nene in Peter-
borough never fails to be
a challenging race for all
involved and 2012 was no
exception. In a weekend of two halves,
the gales of Saturday played havoc with
the beginner crews as many failed to
complete the course whereas the rela-
tive calm of Sunday delivered more
medals and BUCS points for ICBC’s
seniors, both men and women, heavy-
weight and lightweight.
The lightweight men were once again
worth their weight in gold, winning
their two events with relative ease.
The Novices arrived at the course
early and soon the men’s beginner
eight (cox: Danya Husain/Jake Barker/
Stephan Rossbauer/Martin Ebner/Jéré-
mie Werner/Rayane Jackson/James
Baker/Dan Ward/Elliott Jennings) were
out facing the 25mph winds, and even
stronger gusts. At the start, boats floated
and crashed into each other as they were
battered from bank to bank by the wind.
Such was the extent of the carnage that
only 32 of the 53 crews present com-
pleted the 2.5km course and several
boats are thought to have capsized. Im-
perial’s crew was fortunately NOT one
of these and the guys came ninth over-
all in a time of 13:33.6. The women’s
beginner coxed four (cox: Ana Yong/
Chloe Goulding/Anne Hardijizer/Gi-
ulia Zerbini/Nadine Kalmoni) was in
the same shambolic division. During
the race, the girls crashed with South-
ampton and Zerbini was inches away
from attempting to decapitate their
cox, followed by a “heated conversa-
tion” on the water. Despite this, the
girls took tenth place in 18:04.8, much
more successful than the ten crews that
never made the finish line. The second
beginner division was cancelled due to
the inclement weather, preventing the
women’s beginner 8 and the two men’s
beginner coxed fours from racing.
As the Novices headed home/to Be-
lushi’s, the seniors arrived in Peter-
borough, just as the weather began to

calm. After crew meals of inordinate
size and a good night’s rest, ICBC were
ready to race. The gales had been re-
placed by lighter, yet still gusty, winds
and freezing temperatures, which led
to problems marshalling, even for the
experienced crews. First to face the
4.5km championship course were the
men’s quad (bow: Paul Jones/Myles
Holbrough/Sam Cottrell/Dan Powell).
