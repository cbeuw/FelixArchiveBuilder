Data reliability and sensitivity
Matt Allinson
Feature Editor
This year, we got twice as many
respondents as last year. This was
fantastic news; we were overjoyed
to see that students were as
excited about this survey as we
were. Before we can start making
concrete conclusions about the
sexual characteristics of Imperial
students, we need to know for sure
that we have representative data of
the college.
Last year, for example, we had
no lesbian respondents. Before
we ran the headline “No Lesbians
at Imperial College,” however, we
figured that the veracity of our data
was probably to blame. With the
increased number of respondents
we are hoping for a broader spectrum
of Imperial students.
This year, there was a fresher
bias in the data, with 32% of our
respondents being freshers, while
only 28% of the whole college
population are. The 4th years were
under-represented in the overall
survey this year, making up 16%
of the college total but only 13%
of our respondents. 2nd and 3rd
years were also marginally under-
represented.
More noticeable in the data
spread is the over- and under-
representation of departments.
Primarily, the over-representation of
Physics students (6.9% more of our
respondents were physicists than
are members of college) and the
under representation of medics. (The
percentage of respondents from the
Medical School was 7% less than
the amount of medics that make up
the undergraduate body of Imperial.)
The computing department were
also slightly over-represented while
Chem Eng, Mech Eng and EEE were
slightly under-represented.
More importantly, one must
consider the bias in the nature of
the questionnaire that can’t be
measured statistically. For example,
the majority of our respondents
are happy with their sex lives, and
are actually in a relationship. Is
this representative of the average
Imperial student? It’s hard to say.
It’s feasible to imagine that a sex
survey is most likely to be filled
out by someone with an interesting
sex life than someone with nothing
to report. So it’s believable, for
example, that we don’t have a true
representation of the number of
virgins at Imperial.
Ultimately, though, the main
goals of the sex survey were to be
light hearted and interesting. As
scientists it’s in our nature to try and
generate the best data we possibly
can, however the very relaxed nature
of the survey means we have to
compromise at times.
The sex survey has, noted failing
aside, allowed us to paint a broad
and amusing snapshot of Imperial’s
sex life.
The lowdown on virginity at Imperial
C
oming to a total of 17.8%
of respondents, the data
set of people who have
yet to lose their virgin-
ity is significant enough
to deserve a page of its own. The
discussion below is based on data
gathered from 49 female and 136
male respondents.
Population
Spread
Perhaps unsurprisingly,
this section had more
male respondents than
female. The imbalance
was slightly more
pronounced than the
rest of the survey or
the population of
Imperial, with a ratio
of almost 3:1.
It also does not
come as a surprise
that those who are
typically the youngest
students are most likely
to be virgins; this applies
to almost a quarter of first-
year students.
Across all age groups, a
higher portion of polled
males were virgins
than females, with the
difference becoming more
pronounced for those
students who have spent
more time at Imperial.
Notable is a more than 40%
decrease in the fraction of
female students that are
virgins between their first
and second year.
Masturbation
Contrary to what you may
expect, virgins are no
more likely to masturbate
be truly significant considering the
size of the data sample available.
Conclusion
It may come as a shock, but there
is a distinct statistical possibility
that Imperial students are, in fact,
human beings. Virgins’ decisions
to indulge in onanism and erotica
come down to individual decisions
rather than consequences of their
lack of experience with sexual inter-
course. We hate to disappoint.
Unfortunately, your correspondent
was unable to find comparable data
from other universities. Perhaps one
peculiarity of our cherished College
is that its students are more than
happy to discuss their sex life. That,
or they just really like answering
surveys – we’d have to poll them to
find out.
that of non-virgins. This data was
only slightly polarized by gender
in the case of virgins, and strongly
for non-virgins (where more than
40% of males said it did, whereas
more than two thirds of females
disagreed). This is, again, not too
surprising – those students who are
sexually active are more likely to be
affected by the gender ratio than
those who are not.
Pornography
There was almost no discernible
difference in virgins’ porn habits;
they seem neither more nor less
inclined to indulge in pornography.
Those who stated that cultural or
religious reasons do not affect their
sex lives tended to do so slightly
more frequently, however, the
differences are not large enough to
frequently than their non-virgin
counterparts; the difference in the
fraction of students who masturbate
daily to weekly is minimal. The
spread in the virgins’ data leaned a
lot more significantly towards either
extreme, with the vast majority of
virgins (almost 80%) masturbating
either daily to a few times a week or
less than a year to never, while the
non-virgins’ frequencies were
spread more evenly.
The gender split is
not surprising. Almost
80% of male virgins
masturbate daily to
weekly, while more than
40% of females do so
less than once a year or
never.
Of interest is the
effect of cultural or
religious influences:
of those virgins who
masturbate less than
once a week, more
than half said that
cultural and/or religious
reasons influence their
sex life.
Satisfaction
Following suit with the
other unsurprising
trends, the data shows
that virgins are generally
less happy with their
sex lives. Almost two
thirds were indifferent
or unhappy about theirs,
whereas the same fraction
of non-virgins claim to be
satisfied.
Virgins who claim that
cultural and religious
reasons do not affect
their sex lives tended to
be less happy with their
lack thereof, with almost
80% being indifferent
or unhappy. Conversely,
those who stated that their sex
lives were affected by cultural or
religious reasons tended to be
satisfied despite (or perhaps due
to) never having had sex, with a third
responding that they were happy.
“virgins are no more
likely to masturbate
frequently than their
non-virgin counter-
parts”
Finally, virgins don’t seem more likely
to hold a grudge; the percentage of
virgins who think being at Imperial
has negatively affected their sex
lives is only marginally higher than
