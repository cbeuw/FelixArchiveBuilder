ACADEMY AWARDS SPECIAL
FELIX Friday 02 MARCH 2012 33
Congratulations are in order for Meryl Streep - she finally, FINALLY has that third Oscar. She had to wait al-
most thirty years and pitch in countless outstanding performances to win last Sunday for The Iron Lady. Before
this she had lost a staggering 14 times. Felix Film looks at previous Academy Award winners responsible for
Streep’s losing streak
Jodie Foster’s roaring
comeback as a legitimate
adult star kicked off with
her Oscar-winning role in
The Accused. She was a
successful child star, and
like many in the indus-
try, initially struggled to
make the transition with
several flimsy adult roles.
But The Accused was
the start of a new phase
in this brilliant actress’
career. So there is very
little to be disappointed
with, and yes, she did go
on to beat Streep’s per-
formance in A Cry in the
Dark. But in all fairness,
Foster’s raw portrayal
of a rape victim simply
outclassed all the fellow
nominees in the Best Ac-
tress race of 1989.
Kathy Bates was a late
bloomer in the business,
first getting serious rec-
ognition for a role she
landed aged 40+. But it’s
better late than never,
as her terrifying Annie
Wilkes of Stephen King’s
Misery, a delusional psy-
chopath who decides to
imprison her favourite
author of all time, earned
her a handful of awards,
including an Oscar in
1991. Competing once
again in the tough Best
Actress category was
Streep, perhaps in one of
her weaker, lighter roles
with Postcards from the
Edge. The one thing she
did prove here was that
she could also belt out a
tune live on stage.
There were three strong
contenders in 1996.
Emma Thompson (Sense
and Sensibility), the good
old Meryl (The Bridges of
Madison County) and the
one who actually walked
away with the gong, Su-
san Sarandon, for her
deeply touching per-
formance in Dead Man
Walking. Even the con-
victed killer played to
fierce perfection by Sean
Penn was eventually
moved by her warmth,
and it’s in Sarandon’s
Sister Helen that the film
finds its spiritual core.
The devastating finale is
as painful as it is beauti-
ful, thanks largely to the
veteran actress’ faultless
performance.
A lot of people look back
on Shakespeare in Love
and think whether it was
really worth all that hype
and award love. Given
the strong competition
it faced from superior
war films (Saving Pri-
vate Ryan, The Thin Red
Line), the intelligently
written, wonderfully lav-
ish costume drama was
probably ever-so slightly
overrated. More con-
troversial was Gwyneth
Paltrow’s Oscar triumph
in 1999. Just by direct
comparison, Streep gives
a heart-breaking turn as
a cancer-ridden mother
in One True Thing whilst
Paltrow plays dress-up to
proudly stand on stage to
act. Embarrassing.
Not Streep’s finest hour
this – she did take an
intense crash course in
learning to play the vio-
lin for Music of the Heart
which did get her an
Oscar nomination and
rightfully, nothing further
happened. 2000 was in-
stead a dramatic show-
down between Annette
Bening (American Beau-
ty) and Hilary Swank
(Boys Don’t Cry). Playing
a darker, more twisted
character is always a
safe bet if you want to
win an Oscar, as evi-
denced by Swank’s win
for playing a girl playing
a boy (or was it the other
way around?). Either way,
bravo Hilary, for a truly
remarkable performance.
