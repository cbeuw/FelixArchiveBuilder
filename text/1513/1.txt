Online petition to
prevent mountain
hut charges
Having made the decision earlier this
year, Sport Imperial began charging for
a mountain hut used by various Clubs
& Societies as a rest stop during outdoor
trips. At first, the hut was free to use by
societies and houses approximately twen-
ty-five people. Prices of £50 for booking
weekend use were introduced without a
consultation period, focus group or notifi-
cation to the clubs.
Prior to the merger of several medi-
cal schools to form the Imperial College
School of Medicine, the hut was donated
to St Mary’s Hospital Medical School
with the intent to encourage students to
take part in outdoor activities without in-
curring further costs.Yet, students believe
charging goes against the original aims of
the donation.
Baffled students in various outdoor
clubs took to Facebook with an online
page and petition in protest. In the peti-
tion, which gained 206 signatures at the
time of writing, students posted com-
ments such as: “this goes totally against
the spirit of the charitable donation of the
hut”, “charging… is simply unacceptable,
particularly without consultation”, and
“as a club we simply wouldn’t have been
able to take so many people into the out-
doors so frequently without it, and we re-
ally appreciated this charitable donation”.
Recreational clubs which were affected
include the Fellwanderers, Mountaineer-
ing, Canoeing and various other outdoor
societies, who collectively believed that
“charging for use… goes against the
original intentions of the donation and
is the first step in commercialising this
charitable gift”. The 123 strong Facebook
group’s description said that “the finan-
cial impact on the clubs who use it regu-
larly is not negligible… members will
bear the brunt of the cost”.
