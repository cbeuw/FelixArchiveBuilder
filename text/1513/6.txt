F
elix: What has been the
highlight of your year?
Scott: There really have
been too many to just single
out one.
My more ‘jovial’highlights are going
to the British Grand Prix (courtesy of
Santander Bank and declared to Coun-
cil); visiting Aachen for the IDEALis-
tic conference and getting to interact
with our European counterparts; at-
tending meetings with other Sus from
the Russell Group and being invited to
a parliamentary roundtable discussion.
On the more serious notes I would
say that receiving direct confirmation
from the Government that all the hard
work we put in to our White Paper Re-
sponse in the summer was fruitful was
a big highlight. We suggested that they
drop the proposals to penalise students
that wanted to repay their student loans
early and they listened!
We were quoted as one of three Stu-
dent Organisations to input, the other
two being the NUS and the Open Uni-
versity Student Association.
Furthermore I am very proud that
we have made the brave move to work
with other London Unions to create the
London Student Manifesto. This is eas-
ily the first time since we left ULU we
have worked so closely with other SUs
in London.
I can also say that our Freshers’Week
was very successful and great experi-
ence – even if I did give 18 talks in four
days!
F: What have you been most satisfied
with during your time in the role?
S: The performance of the entire team;
both the staff and Sabbaticals.
We have done some amazing things
in the year so far and it has only been
possible with the support of everyone
and the great team dynamic we have.
The NSS Response which we wrote
as a guide to improving the student ex-
perience has had a huge effect, chang-
ing policy in the College, triggering
committees to creating working groups
and really emphasising what students
need to make their time here better.
I have also managed to increase the
representative power of the Union by
securing us seats on more committees
and making it regular for the Union
to meet the Principles of Faculties. I
have also secured confirmation that the
Union will participate in the processes
to select the next Rector and Pro-Rec-
tor (Education).
This year we even received an invite
to the Rector’s Away Day for the first
time in our history.
F: What have been least satisfied
with during your time in the role?
S: Most of the time I that I have
been dissatisfied it has been with the
College. Last year there were large
amounts of negative feeling towards
College Management due to the Life
Sciences restructure. We had all ex-
pected that this would have shown the
College the importance of considering
student opinions and the necessity of
providing greater consultation. How-
ever it isn’t too hard to see that this is
not the case. Look at the Holland Club.
If the College had announced they were
going to give a £4m make over to the
venue very few people would have
been concerned. However by keeping
all plans undercover and disclosing as
little as possible they have created an
even bigger air of suspicion about their
activities.
F: Do you feel at all disconnected
from the student body after a year in
the role?
S: If I am completely honest I feel the
absolute opposite.
I think I now know an Undergradu-
ate student in every department, have
access to someone in every year group
and, due to my age, have friends do-
ing PhDs. I even live with the first year
students in Wilkinson Hall. And it’s
not like I hide in my room and curse
their untidiness. I go out for drinks with
them; we cook in the kitchen together;
watch movies and TV, etc. I even went
on the Halls trip to Belgium. And I re-
ally do find this really useful, because
we end up talking about their courses,
what the Union does, etc. I feel like I
understand more about the 1st year
courses than I did when I was a Fresher
myself.
F: How have you delivered on your
manifesto points so far?
S: One of the first things you discover
when you take office is that Manifesto
points are easy to write but difficult to
achieve. However I think it is fair to
say I did choose a large selection of
deliverable aims. I said from the on-
set that I wanted to complete a Guin-
ness World Record, the initial thought
being the World’s Largest Jagertrain.
But as you can imagine the negative
press, and sheer cost, that this event
could cause did make it decided to
change tack. I can, however, tell you it
would take 1,548 or more jagerbombs
to win. Instead I have decided to work
with College Outreach to try to break
the more achievable ‘World’s Largest
Chemistry Lesson.’Due to an irritating
thing called the Olympics it seems this
will be able to plan it this year but not
do it until next academic year.
As for other pledges, if you go to the
Quad you will now be able to with-
draw cash; if you look at our finances
you will see that we are balancing the
budget and if you attend the General
Meeting in Summer you will see me
striving for greater efficiency.
What I would say, though, is that
I feel confident in saying that I have
achieved far more beneficial things for
the students of Imperial College than
my manifesto points would ever have
done, by doing the things I knew imag-
ined I would do.
F: What’s an average day like in the
office?
S: If there was an average day then I
would really query the necessity of a
Sabbatical for this role! Take today
for instance, I went for my fortnightly
breakfast with the ICSMSU President,
had a meeting in College, worked on a
survey for PG student engagement and
analysed the results from the bursary
survey. If I do this next week I would
definitely think I was a cast member on
the movie Groundhog Day.
F: Are there any aspects of the role
which you feel you could’ve handled
better?
S: I think it is fair to say that everyone
will look back at things they have done
and criticise themselves – it’s only hu-
