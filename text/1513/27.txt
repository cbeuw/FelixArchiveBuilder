Happy with your sex life?
A comment on the survey – and how it compares to last year
2x
NUMBER OF
RESPONDENTS
this time around. Missed by some
participants was the question on sex
toys, but in general the ethos for this
year’s version was “more”. We strived
for a finer granularity of data than
before, and it is this – along with the
increase of people willing to fill out the
survey – that allows us to bring you
this eight-page bonanza of analysis.
Of course, the survey can still
be improved. While we are very
pleased with the increased number
of respondents, it is clear that there
remains a trust barrier when it comes
to the survey. This is something we
would ideally like to overcome, and
I would stress again that the data is
completely anonymous.
“The survey itself
also differed this
time around”
One consideration for any future
editions might be to allow students
to view the survey before logging
in. Perhaps knowing the questions
in advance – and being able to see
the “do not wish to say” option – will
make them feel more comfortable
about participating.
Returning to the comparison with
last year,perhaps the best comparison
we can make is again one of “more”.
We have done our best in this pull
out to provide you with the most
interesting data and correlations we
could find, and we hope this increased
output is of as much interest to you
as last year.
“most of the analy-
ses carried out both
years show very simi-
lar results”
(from lowest to highest) have changed,
as you can see in our centrefold.
What is interesting about this
particular statistic is that most of the
percentages have increased. It is nice
to see that there are more virgins who
are happy to say so this time around.
The survey itself also differed
F
antastically, there were twice
as many respondents this
year, which has allowed us
to go into much more detail
this time around. On the oth-
er hand, that makes it rather difficult
to compare many of our analyses, as
there is nothing to compare against.
An interesting point to note is the
large fresher bias we had this year.
Last time the majority of respondents
were in their third or fourth year –
attributed to the influence of Felix
Editors and their social links. Any
reasoning on my part as to why this is
would be purely conjecture – perhaps
current first years are more sexually
active and hence more likely to fill out
the survey.
Other than that, most of the
analyses carried out both years show
very similar results. This includes,
however, the fact that the majority of
our respondents were not virgins –
which skews how much we can rely
on this data representing Imperial
as a whole. Barring that, it is good to
see that our results this year enforce
the relevance of those from the debut
survey.
There are some statistics that have
varied this year, outside a sensible
margin of error. However, it is with
caution that we would put much
emphasis on these changes. Many
of the respondents from last year
may very well have been in their final
year, and the large percentage of first-
year respondents this year obviously
represents brand-new data.
One such statistic is the percentage
of virgins per department. It is difficult
to say why this is the case, but both
the percentages and the ordering

A
nd the winners for sex life
satisfaction by department
this year are the Materials
department, with 73% of
their respondents being
either happy or very happy with their
sex life. Notably, there is a larger pro-
portion of Bioengineers that are in a
relationship than are happy or very
happy with their sex life. Does this
suggest that the partners of bioengi-
neering students are terrible in bed?
Or that bioengineers have incredibly
high standards for their sex life? Po-
tentially. It is interesting to note, how-
ever, that bioengineers have the sec-
ond lowest proportion of people in a
relationship who are in a relationship
with a fellow Imperial student. Per-
haps it is fairer to conclude that the
fact that a lot of bioengineering stu-
dents have potentially long distance
relationships is why they are unhappy
with their sex life.

Does Imperial negatively
affect your sex life?
Strongly Somewhat Slightly Not really Quite the
contrary
Responses
People who feel that Imperial does
not affect their sex life have 51% of
the vote. Does this mean we can
definitively disprove the theory that
Imperial Students are sex deprived and
mad about it?
A pessimist would say no,and there’s
a lot of evidence for them to make
their case. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this
50:50 split is almost identical to the
one observed in the total number of
respondents who are in a relationship.
Because our survey has a bias in
attracting people who are happy in
their sex life, perhaps we are getting
an un-representatively happy view of
Imperial’s sex life.
Your correspondent, however, would
like to take the positive outlook on
life, and certainly wouldn’t want to
encourage self-fulfilling despondency.
The Materials department, who
have the highest sex life satisfaction
despite having the lowest proportion
of students in a relationship with an
imperial college student, seem to have
the answer. Perhaps if you’re feeling a
little lonely you should get an RSM wing
man.
On a final note, and of importance to
College and the Union,25% of students
taking our survey said that their sex life
at Imperial had, or would, negatively
affect their answer to the National
Student Survey. Seeing as college is on
a large drive at the moment to improve
Imperial’s currently dire standing in this
metric, perhaps opening a department
of English Literature, Psychology or
Vetinary Medicine would help.
