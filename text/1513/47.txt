Missing Andy are a five-piece indie rock act that are riding on the crest of a wave, having
performed at the renowned SXSW festival alongside the likes of The Wombats, Pigeon
Detectives and Lightspeed Champion. The band have also been asked to be part of a
soundtrack to the forthcoming Hollywood movie Chain Letter (featuring Nikki Read of Twilight
fame).
With tracks such as The Way We’re Made it’s easy to see why Missing Andy are gaining so
much attention. The song is a stunning combination of driving rhythms, potent riffs, soaring
instrumentation and an infectious mix of spoken and crooned vocals.
Missing Andy are launching their new Album “Generation Silenced.” Come join us for
an amazing night of live music from a truly outstanding up and coming British band.
