This summer, Kadhim will cycle from
John O’Groats to Land’s End, on a
tandem, with a skeleton on the back
seat; the furthest any man or woman
has ever cycled on a tandem with a
skeleton...
In process, he hopes to raise £10,000
for the Rector’s Scholarships, which
helps students of all backgrounds to
attend Imperial.
