Wednesday 22 February saw the finest
snowsports sports athletes from uni-
versities in the south of the UK gather
for BUISC (British university indoor
snowsports championships) South. Im-
perial College London were in no lack
of talent this year, with strong racing
and freestyle prospects. Everyone gath-
ered bright and early (except for Ross
who decided he needed more of a lie
in to boost performance) to make the
journey to Milton Keynes indoor snow
centre.
Strong racing performances were put
in by the skiers for the individual sa-
lom event, most notably veteran (and
some say semi pro), Michael Parkes
obtained a solid 29th position. An
equally strong performance was put in
by most (but not all) of the snowboard
racers. Virgin racer, Ed Hallet zoomed
down the course scoring 11th overall,

Luke Bridgestock
He was *this* close to hitting the roof
Excellent results for
snowsports at BUISC
earning himself a place in the BUISC
finals! Ross Maske just missed out on
the finals finishing in an impressive
15th place. A special congrats goes to
John Boi who managed to complete
his first ever race without disqualifica-
tion. Ex-snowboard captain, Luke ‘safe
n’ steady’ Bridgestock disgraced him-
self and the club with a pathetic per-
formance, earning himself a lager and
baileys. Rumor has it he is over the hill
(excuse the pun).
Our ski race team was unfortunately
bested in the first round despite a solid
performance (the standard was high).
The snowboard race team had more
luck in the first round beating Exeter
(CSM scumbags) who had vandalized
the union minibus with cling film and
a pizza box earlier in the day (savages).
Payback was sweet! However, were
knocked out in the next round (with
any hopes of going to the finals) by
John Boi returning to his usual form
of “slow time or no time”. Needless
to say the rest of the team were bitterly
disappointed, and are still refusing to
talk to John.
In the evening the excitement and
adrenaline fueled slopestyle competi-
tion kicked off. With more Imperial
entries into this freestyle comp. (8 in
total), then any in recent years, there
was a real chance of glory. Solid runs
were landed by most of Imperial’s
competitors with fresher snowboarders
Ross Maske and Mikkel (not Michael)
Kranker landing some sick tricks. John
Boi pulled out all the stops doing ‘the
sickest run of my life braaaahhh!’
(douchebag quote of the day). Male
freeskiers Adam MacLean and Simon
Federer laid down some awesome
moves with Simon inches away from
landing his first 540. However the real
star of the show (and the day), was fe-
male freeskier and our beloved presi-
dent, Bethany Burks. She killed it in the
qualifying rounds earning a place in the
finals. Pulling of some of the gnarly-
est tricks seen by a female competitor
since the days of Ces O’Holigan, Beth
achieved 3rd place overall a position in
the podium.
The innovations were not only con-
fined to the slope. One freestyle com-
petitor, not only managed to produce
a football size bruise on his arm with
more colors than the rainbow, he also
made advancements in the field of mo-
torway urination. In all a very success-
ful day, and next Wednesday (29 Feb)
will see Ed Hallet and Burksey battle it
out on the national level at the BUISC
finals in Leeds. The very best of luck to
both of them!
Matching skis and bibs are all the rage on the slopes
