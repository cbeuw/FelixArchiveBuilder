What’s better than one fulfilling existence?
TWO wordokus, you say? Well, in that case
you’re in for a treat!
Tell you what, in addition, every row, column
and 3x3 box must contain the letters in the grid
once and once only. Along one of the rows or
columns, a very special word or phrase will ap-
pear. More often than not, I’ve been told that
these phrases yield great advice to be applied to
almost any situation.
The headings above reflect the childishness of
the word or phrase. The more childish the word,
the more difficult the wordoku.

The cells in a grid have to be coloured
or left blank according to numbers at
the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many un-
broken lines of filled-in squares there

are in any given row or column. Look at
last week’s solution to see what a typi-

The overall solution should yield
some sort of picture, or as good as a
picture can look in monochrome on
a 15x15 grid.
