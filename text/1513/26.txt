T
he number of respon-
dents we had to the sex
survey this year has
been almost over-
whelming. 1063 of
you replied, and only about 20
of them as far as we could tell
were blatant trolls (thank you
guys btw for making us laugh).
Over the course of these next
seven pages, we’ll delve into the
details of the results that you’ve
given us. You’ve told us about
what you’ve done, who you’ve
done, and where you’ve done it.
Furthermore you’ve told us
how happy you are with what
you’re getting and helped us ad-
dress some of the classic Impe-
rial clichés about gender imbal-

The Front Page
Our front page takes on the form of a word cloud
made up from all the text responses to the “any
other information” question in the survey. The
size of the word corresponds to the frequency
the word appeared across all the answers (yes,
the words “thug life” appeared many times).

RESPONSES**ANDonly21roguemavericks.
A
s with any survey on this scale,
there’s always a significant
chance of individuals (mas-
sive jokers, trolls, whatever re-
ally takes your fancy) providing a
great deal of fake data that could poten-
tially skew the results. We’ve worked hard
to filter this misinformation out and ensure
that the data we have is as reliable as can
possibly be.
One way to significantly cut down on this
was to restrict the survey to people with an
Imperial College London login – but then, it
was for Imperial students anyway.
More complex methods for troll-busting
took on two main forms. The first was an
automated method, whereas the second
required human interaction.
If you provided your department when fill-
ing out the survey, we also obtained your
department from the College database
(as acknowledged within the privacy state-
ment). If these did not match, we flagged
your entry as a potential fake entry. If
you did not provide your department, this
check was not made. Your real depart-
ment was never stored. This worked for
everyone except those studying within the
Royal School of Mines, as a bug marked all
these students as trolls. Hey, obviously it
can’t all go incredibly smoothly.
In addition, we combed through every en-
try to spot any obvious foul play.
Some of the possible trolls were too
close to call, however, after extensive
discussion a decision was made on each
case. The result is we only analyse truthful
data – making these statistics more accu-
rate.

ance and frustration.
So thank you, everyone, who took the
time to share this information with us.
We appreciate that telling this stuff to
complete strangers is a sensitive is-
sue and we’ve dealt with it with the
utmost privacy and discretion. The
raw data has long since been deleted
and great lengths were taken to make
sure that no individual was identifiable
in either this print copy, or to our writ-
ers while we were analysing the data.
Thanks also go to the people who do-
nated a huge amount of their time in
helping me analyse your data and
produce this pull out, without whom I
would’ve known where to start.
So sit back and enjoy, and I hope
you find this report as funny but infor-
mative to read as we found to write.

Best of the comments
In an effort to allow you to share any addi-
tional information with us, we gave you the
option of leaving comments. From a data
analysis perspective, this may have been
unwise (a grand total of about three com-
ments were of any objective use), but it cer-
tainly did throw up some points of interest.
The gender ratio was a common cause
of concern. Responses on the matter var-
ied in eloquence from “TOO MANY MEN
TOO MANY MEN” to “the Imperial campus
possesses a distinct lack of totty. This is
a shame.” Males especially seemed upset
at the fact that “there are so many more
honeys at other London universities.” Opin-
ions were not exclusively negative, however;
the phrase “I’m a GIRL in COMPUTING” was
used as a supporting argument at least
once.
Many respondents felt the need to ex-
press their love for sexual acts in general.
Phrases such “sex is *good*!” and less
print-friendly versions thereof were scat-
tered around the data set.
Some rather worrying details were
shared, including discussion of how easy it
is to masturbate on the fourth level of our
cherished library. (Apparently, you just need
to “get that table right in the corner.”)
Felix would also like to offer its congratu-
lations to the engineering student who “did
it for the first time last Tuesday.” In their
own words: “Awh yeah.”
“I’m in love! Yay!”

“THUG LIFE BITCHES”
“There are so many more
honeys at other London
universities.”
