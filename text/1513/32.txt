In one of the sections of the survey, you
told us which on-campus locations you’d
(allegedly) gotten lucky in. We’ve collated
this data into a map conveniently coloured
according to the number of respondents
claiming to have used these locations for
more than their intended purpose.
Objectively speaking, the variation

between most locations can not be considered
truly significant when comparing the sample
size: the counts for the vast majority of
locations varied between the low-to-mid 20’s.
Blackett is particularly popular, with almost
30 people admitting to having had intercourse
in its hallowed halls – or showers. The
communal areas of Halls of Residence take the
crown, however: more than 125 people seem
fairly unconcerned about matters of privacy.
The same is also indicated by the popularity of
outdoors locaions, Queen’s Lawn and Prince’s
Gardens.
It is the library, however, that is a cause of
true concern. More than 30 individuals claimed
to have used this shrine of knowledge as a
place of study of rather non-academic matters.

Overall, it is clear that many respondents
know little shame – or at least flexible quantities
thereof. With 19% of respondents (a whooping
194) listing at least one location, a significant
fraction of students seem to be getting very,
very lucky. We cannot say the same for those
who walk in on them.
