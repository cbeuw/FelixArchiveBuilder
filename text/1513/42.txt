FILM
Chicago was the domi-
nating force to be reck-
oned with in 2003,
scooping all the impor-
tant prizes. Catherine
Zeta-Jones, in her sultry,
foot-stomping interpreta-
tion of a vaudeville singer
turned murderess in a jail
block, won Best Support-
ing Actress, besting out
a range of other talented
performers of that year,
one of whom was the
unlucky Meryl in Adapta-
tion. A quirky, hugely fun
character in an equally
quirky and eccentric film
based on a screenplay by
Charlie Kaufman, Streep
was a bold and unique
drugged up author – yes,
this woman can really do
anything.
Nothing was going to
stop Helen Mirren in a
year that was dominated
by her outstanding per-
formance in The Queen.
2007 saw the worthy
star scooping up dozens
and dozens of presti-
gious awards for playing
Elizabeth II. And although
Streep managed to make
the Academy’s nomina-
tions along with Mirren
as the deliciously evil Mi-
randa Priestly in The Dev-
il Wears Prada, there was
just no slowing down the
momentum The Queen
carried with it ever since
its ecstatic opening night
response at the Venice
Film Festival where Mir-
ren was awarded the
Volpi Cup.
Producers of The Reader
must have been a ner-
vous wreck when their
cheeky attempt to slide
Kate Winslet into the
less competitive Best
Supporting Actress cat-
egory failed and saw the
Engilsh actress placed in
the same tight race as
Streep in 2009. It was
an intense performance
from Streep too, playing
the ferocious Sister Aloy-
sius in Doubt potentially
ruining Winslet’s chances
of winning her first ever
Oscar. Although The
Reader hardly marks the
highest point achieved by
Winslet, it is nonetheless
a haunting performance,
something that should
not have gone unnoticed.
Julie & Julia should have
been Meryl’s third Oscar.
But no… The Academy
voters, loving new win-
ners and doing almost
anything to avoid repeat
winners, managed to find
the 2010 Best Actress
winner in The Blind Side’s
Sandra Bullock. It’s one
of Bullock’s most appeal-
ing performances, but
in no way exceptional.
The film itself enjoyed a
strong box office, which
must be the reason why
this shallow, feel-good
sports movie was even
considered. The hype
around this started late,
but was a powerful one,
something that carried
through all the way to the
end.
We beat Streep too
