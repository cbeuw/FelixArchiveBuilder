MINERS
BRING BACK
O
nce again the Royal
Miners set off on their
quest to the dark regions
of Cornwall in search
of Bottle Match glory.
For those that don’t know, the Bottle
Match is a 110 year old varsity, staged
between the Royal School of Mines
(RSM) and Camborne School of Mines
(CSM). Each year the competition is
hosted by one of the two schools at
their home ground, with this year being
the turn of the CSM to host down in
Cornwall. The Bottle Match is the big-
gest weekend of the year for any Royal
Miner and always delivers in high ten-
sions, heavily contested matches, ex-
cessive nudity, (most-likely-gone-too-
far) banter and filthy hangovers.
With 150 people on board the coach-
es left London and made it to Cornwall
without in record time, before becom-
ing stuck up a country lane and one
having to be literally pushed out of the
mud! So we arrived at the caravan site
a little late but had the comforting news
that during our travels the Squash and
Golf teams, who had left ahead of us
for their games, had won and drawn
their respective contests, meaning that
the first two trophies of the weekend
were returning to London. The Satur-
day saw the bulk of the sport, with the
men’s and ladies hockey, football, net-
ball and the all-important rugby which
decides the home of The Bottle for the
next year.
After a successful weekend the Bot-
tle remains to grace the Union Bar for
another year, and the miners return to
London victorious (if a little battered
and broken).
Introduction by
Royal School of Mines Union President Richard Simons
Being the first to arrive in Camborne
the RSM Squash team kicked off
proceedings, captained by Nat Elliot-
Green (N.E.G), calling on the experi-
ence of the veterans Henry Debens
and Mark Porter, and the youth and
vitality of the French freshers Rapha-
el Pesquidous and Marc Lelong.
Each player gave it their all, barring
Mr Debens who allowed a 2-0 lead to
drag out to a 3-2 victory, with 4 of the
5 RSM players nothing up a perfect
score sheet of 3-0. RSM claimed
the whitewash, winning 15 games to
CSM’s 2, and got the weekend go-
ing to the best of starts by bringing
home the A.L Thomas Memorial Tro-
phy for the second year on the trot.

CSM 0-5 RSM
After last year’s victory, the team was
feeling confident, since we had re-
tained most of last year’s squad and
had also added some quality freshers
to our ranks. We started the game
well and a scrappy CSM into conced-
ed several penalties which resulted in
their scrum-half being sin binned. We
spent most of this half camped on
their try line but were unable to capi-
talise until the 35th minute when Fra-
Rugby

(Largest margin in
Bottle Match history!)
ser “The Salmon” James leapt over
for the first try of the game, leaving
the score at half time 7-0 RSM.
We started the second half in a simi-
lar fashion to the first, but were once
again unable to cross the line as CSM
fought bravely in defence. Finally in
the 60th Sam “1.0” Coe crashed over
after good work from the forwards and
we never looked back. Minutes later
Chris McGeough charged down the
wing and steamrolled past several
defenders like a runaway train. Then
in the last play of the game Captain
Ed “EGV” drove in off a maul for the
final score of the game. Notable per-
formances came from George Lane,
James Scaife, Mike Floyd and Fred
White. Olly Cox somehow claimed
man of the match from their captain,
which will forever remain a mystery.
“Broken” Ed Vaughan
Considering this was the first match
RSM played as a team we did really
well. We only lost the first quarter,
so after finding our feet we went on
to draw or win in the next 3. Unfortu-
nately it was too little too late, and
CSM claimed their first victory in
Bottle Match netball. The natural tal-
ent of the RSM shone through and
there is no doubt that next year we’ll
win it back.

Netball
CSM 38-29 RSM
In the first game of Saturday both
teams had a strong opening half,
despite the barrage of abuse pour-
ing in from each side, but CSM took
an early lead with a well-placed short
corner. The first half carried on with
high intensity play from both sides
and continued with a few more ques-
tionable tackles (including one that
probably belonged on a rugby pitch)
which went unnoticed by the ref-
erees. A second short corner from
CSM was mis-hit but then recovered
to bring the score to CSM 2 - 0 RSM
towards the end of the first half.
The second half saw the RSM La-
dies stage a comeback, with Harriet
Stevenson bringing the score to 2
- 1. RSM continued to put pressure
on the CSM squad for the remain-
der of the second half but the robust
defence of CSM meant the game
ended CSM 2 – 1 RSM.

CSM 2-1 RSM
RSM Hockey has enjoyed its
usual mix of unbounded success
and abject misery this season, but
we arrived for this year’s Sharpley
Cup with high hopes. Some sneaky
weaving from the Camborne at-
tack opened our defence up inside
the first 5 seconds... panic over,
though, and we soon settled into a
fast-paced - but evenly matched -
contest. James, Freddie, Lionel and
Harry soaked up the pressure from
the notable talents of the CSM at-
tack, until a well-placed cross was
Men’s Hockey
CSM 3-1 RSM
converted after 15 minutes: 1-0
CSM. The response didn’t take long,
however, with Lionel scoring from a
sublime short corner to level it.
The midfield of Scouse, Mikey and
Jake continued to give it everything
into the second half, but were
unable to present Ewan,
Mash and Ben up-
front with a clear-
cut chance
for what
could have
been the
all-important second goal. The pace
started to tell into the last quarter,
and two CSM goals in quick succes-
sion finished the game off.
Man of the Match goes to Lionel
Sumner for his tireless
performance, Cham-
pagne Moment to Jon-
nie Clowes for any one
of his 573 immense
saves. Massive respect
to everyone who played, and
cheers to all the supporters.
Mikey Pettit
The first match out was between
the two best ranking golfers and
was a close match, ending in a
win for the CSM on the 17th hole.
Next out where the two girls, Sor-
cha and Rachel (a non-CSM ring-
er!) but Sorcha brought home the
match comfortably despite a glo-
rious shank into a greenside bun-
ker. The third pairing, consisting
of Alec and some other bloke was
over by the 16th, leaving the CSM
2:1 up with only one match left.
At this point, moral was low and
a victory for CSM was on the ho-
rizon. But with courage and deter-
mination Steve Hayward fought off
his competitor to bring the score
to 2 all. Since the RSM golfers
won the previous year, the trophy
remains in its rightful place (In a
tree next to the football pitch in
Pool). Special thanks go out to the
Golf Manageress Celia Hayes for
her support and encouragement
throughout.

Football
CSM 0-0 RSM
In a titanic effort from both sides,
CSM and RSM fought out a gritty, well
contested goalless draw. After a fre-
netic opening, RSM settled into their
rhythm first. At the half way stage it
was already evident that goals would
be very hard to come by, with set
pieces likely to be pivotal in deciding
the outcome. RSM repeatedly forced
corners, followed by CSM chances
requiring several stunning save from
RSM custodian, Daly. The final whis-
tle blew. Either side could claim that
they deserved victory, yet there was a
tacit acceptance that a draw was un-
questionably the fairest result on the
day, after sterling performances from
two very, very well matched teams.
