T
im: First off, I apologise
if I ask any questions
that you’ve been asked
before...
Chris: Well, it’s kind
of difficult not to do that. It’s the na-
ture of interviews. I once did a proper
press junket day where you’d stay in
a room and people come in every five
minutes and it’s fucking weird – you
think you’re going out of your mind.
So don’t worry about it, it can’t be as
bad as that.
T: Let’s start with The Thick of It.
Ollie, the character you play, what I
always think about him is that he’s
actually quite a horrible person. He
does some really unlikeable things
but he’s very likeable and I think
that’s kind of a testament to you
and your acting the fact that you’ve
made this character who is not very
likeable on the face of it be an actual
quite likeable character – what’s
your take on that?
C: I think the reason Ollie is likeable –
here’s the thing – Toby, his counterpart
in In the Loop is rather less likeable
than Ollie. Toby’s a proper shit. And
Ollie, yeah Ollie does some fairly un-
likable things, as do all the characters,
but if there’s anything that makes him
likeable is the fact that he’s so spec-
tacularly incompetent and he’s a bit
downtrodden in a way. You know he’s
at the bottom of the pile and because
he’s at the bottom of the pile you au-
tomatically feel slightly sorry for him
and I think that feels a little bit like lik-
ing him.
T: That’s true, he is incompetent,
and in fact that leads me quite well
onto my next point. An American
remake was made and it failed – do
you think that this should work well
in America or do you think that they
like programmes where people are
more like well-oiled machines?
C: Well I know it works over there
because we made [In the Loop] as
In The Thick of It with Chris Addison a
Tim Arbabzadah goes on pun overload as he asks the stand-up comedian/actor about ev
a sort-of cousin to The Thick of It. It
was released in America and did well
in America and it was nominated for
an Oscar. The American pilot for ABC
was terrible – it had really, really good
people involved in it but it was terri-
ble. But Armando Iannucci and one of
the writers Simon Blackwell created
a show for HBO which starts in April
called Veep which is very much in the
style of The Thick of It but with Ameri-
cans. It has Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the
Vice President of America set in her
office. So you can definitely do it in
America, they absolutely love it. Well,
the blue states love it. The red states?
Eh… not so much.
T: I like to compare the show to The
West Wing, where everyone has these
great speeches and everyone’s really
good at their jobs, whereas in The
Thick of It everyone’s a little bit less
good...
C:Well yeah, there’s room for both of
those things, one of the things about
The West Wing is that it’s a very hope-
ful show – it’s very positive about the
power of politics to do good and that
doesn’t really turn up in The Thick of
It. The Thick of It is not cynical about
politics, it definitely isn’t, but what you
have to remember is that The Thick of
It is a workplace sitcom. If you take the
politics out of The Thick of It – which
might seem like an odd thing to do,
but actually you should try this – you
realise that actually you’re just deal-
ing with a classic British workplace
sitcom where a bunch of people who
don’t really get on are thrown together
in the same place and put under im-
mense pressure and then we see what
happens to them in that situation. The
politics is the ‘sit’. It could have been
some people in a conference centre, or
a mechanics workshop, or a bakers, or
anything, but it happens to be in the
world of politics. With The West Wing
it’s much more actually about politics
and its machinations and it’s also a
soap about the characters so you need
more emotional juice out of it.
T: Can I now go back a little bit in
time? Not literally, obviously…
C:Well the answer to that is, no, you
can’t. Literally, no, but figuratively,
give it a go.
T: After university, did you go
straight into comedy?
C: I went into comedy about a year
after I graduated. What they don’t tell
you, what nobody ever tells you and
what you’re not particularly going
to thank me for telling you (although
it’s probably best that I do) is that the
year after university is one of the worst
years of your life. Unless you’re on a
vocational course like medicine where
things sort of meld into your career, the
year after university is bleak and dif-
ficult because it’s a big, big, big jolt.
You’ve had 14 or 15 years of formal
education, you’ve been in the place
where all your friends are, you’ve had
roughly the same hours. If you want to
do stuff at the union, there are a billion
things you can do there with like-mind-
ed people. But the minute you throw
your mortarboard up into the air it’s
over. It’s over. The door is locked and
bolted behind you and there’s no way
back in.
It’s extremely depressing, and in that
year I became really bleakly depressed.
I had done a lot of drama and so on –
not acting – but directing a lot of plays
as that was the thing I wanted to go on
and do and it’s really easy at university.
If you’re doing a student production it’s
a cheaper licence but if you’re trying to
do it out in the real world it’s fucking
hard. You need to earn money while
doing it, you need to find people who
want to do it; it’s a really, really hard
thing to do. In the end I needed some
kind of creative outlet and stand-up is
the easiest one. If you have no other
skills, if you’re not musical particu-
larly or you can’t draw or you know all
of those sort of things… stand-up. It’s
dead easy. You just pitch up, somebody
else sorts the lights, the room and the
advertising. You just need to come up
with some words – that’s all you have
to do. So that’s why I tried it really. I’d
never planned it. I certainly didn’t do
anything like it at university – I wasn’t
in a revue or anything.
T: I can imagine what my parents’
reaction would be if I told them I
wanted to be a stand-up comic. It
would be something along the lines
of, “yeah, no, that’s really funny but
can you actually do a real job at some
point?” Were your parents OK with
it?
C: Yeah, they’ve always been tremen-
dously supportive. I think that once it
eventually – quite a long way down
the line – became clear that I was go-
ing to be alright they relaxed and really
enjoyed it but they’ve always been tre-
mendously supportive. When I set out
I gave myself five years and said, “if
in five years this is clearly going no-
