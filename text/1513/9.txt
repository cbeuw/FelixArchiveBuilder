Do you feel the faculty unions aren’t
equal in that your role is the only
sabbatical position?
Inevitably the faculty unions become
unequal because of my sabbatical
position. I think ICSMSU are lucky
because by having a full time officer,
we are able to achieve a lot across the
board just because we have more time
and faculty contact. That’s not to say I
think they should be unequal, I would
highly support the other faculties get-
ting sabb presidents.
How have you delivered on your
manifesto points so far?
Fortunately a lot of my manifesto
points were also aims of the college/
ICU – improving the ‘completion of
the circle’ with regard to feedback
from students to faculty and vica
versa was a key aim and has been ad-
dressed from all sides.
Do you feel there’s more prestige
associated with being ICSM Presi-
dent than the other positions?
I am proud of having had the opportu-
nity to held the position, so I suppose
there must be to some extent! Being
the ‘face of the medical school’ is
amazing.
Being ‘Queen of the Reynolds’, how
have you fended off attempts to
close the bar?
We have worked closely with the new
CX campus dean, Building Managers,
ICU commercial services, Security
etc to ensure that we are all abiding
by union rules and the law and to find
ways to enhance our working rela-
tionships. I think communication has
been a key factor in this. We fortu-
nately haven’t had any real bar-clos-
ing-attempts this year!
Is the experience gained from run-
ning the ICSMSU worth taking a
year out of the lengthy medical de-
grees?
Mostly. A year is a long time, and for
someone who loves medicine, you do
sometimes miss it. However, the skills
I have gained (people management,
super efficient admin) will help me a
lot in my F1 year and beyond.
What would you say to people on
the fence about standing for nomi-
nations right now?
Do it, the SU experience is a hugely
enjoyable one and really does give
you skills you won’t get elsewhere.
Don’t be scared of competition, con-
tested positions allows the electorate
to decide who is best for them at this
time, so you shouldn’t worry if you
aren’t successful.
What’s a day in the life of an ICSM
committee officer like?
Hugely variable from position to po-
sition – generally there are so many
responsibilities flying around that we
are trying to keep everything running
smoothly day to day and ‘changing
the union’ from time to time. Hav-
ing new ideas is great, but remember
maintenance is essential too.
How has the ICSM responded to
claims of excessive alcoholism?
We have made huge changes over the
last few years to our bar and edited
events to counter this. Similarly, by
running welfare campaigns we try to
increase people’s awareness of alco-
hol and its risks.
Do you feel the drinking culture
would deter non-drinkers from
running for a committee position?
I don’t think so, I certainly know of
many people who have been involved
with the union who are ‘non-drink-
ers’.
What has been the highlight of your
year so far?
I don’t really have one highlight as
yet – working with a fantastic team
within both ICSMSU and ICU and
growing ICSMSU as a whole. If we
manage to get funding for a Reynolds
refurbishment, that will be it!
