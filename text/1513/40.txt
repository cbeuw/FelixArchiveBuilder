We beat Meryl Streep
Streep’s unlucky streak
began all the way back
in 1979, when her first
ever Oscar nomination
for Best Supporting Ac-
tress was won instead
by England’s very own
national treasure Dame
Maggie Smith (Califor-
nia Suite), which is fair
enough, since this was
Streep’s first time in the
Oscar game and her role
in The Deer Hunter was a
rather brief one (although
clearly, not at all unmem-
orable). But she later
went on to receive her
second nomination the
following year for Kramer
vs. Kramer and score her
first victory. Hurrah for
Meryl, in the beginning of
the 80s.
Even to this day, the
late Katharine Hepburn
holds the record for the
most acting Oscar wins
(4), and for one of these
wins she was in direct
competition with Streep.
Although never acknowl-
edging the glitz of the
Oscars (she never once
turned up to accept the
award in person), Hep-
burn was nevertheless
highly respected for her
continuously superb ded-
ication to her craft. Her
win for On Golden Pond
in 1982, over Streep’s
The French Lieutenant’s
Woman was seen as en-
tirely justified, marking
a career-crowning per-
formance for the much-
celebrated actress.
Shirley MacLaine was
no Oscar-magnet either,
and she had to wait for
almost 25 years after her
first nomination for her
eventual win that came
with Terms of Endear-
ment in 1984. Accepting
the award, she thanked
the Academy voters for
finally “terminating the
suspense.” And it’s a
performance that de-
serves every bit of that
golden statuette. Playing
the protective mother in
a teary family soap-op-
era, she single-handedly
lifts the film out of its or-
dinary status. Certainly
a much better choice for
the year’s winner than
Streep’s nominated role
in Silkwood.
The Oscars award perfor-
mances, but occasionally
can bow down to long
careers that have gone
criminally unnoticed. This
partly explains Geral-
dine Page’s win for The
Trip to Bountiful. It’s not
a bad performance, but
perhaps not remarkable
enough in its own right.
For Page, nominated a
whopping seven times
before her win in 1986,
it was about time, but it
almost feels like a con-
solation prize, handed
out due to the actress’
age and long-standing
career. Either way, the
Academy was clearly was
impressed with Page’s
trip than Streep’s one
Out of Africa.
Surprise! Cher the pop
superstar is also an ac-
tress. After she made it
big in the music scene,
she also ruled the screen
with her energetic per-
formances. Her most
famous Moonstruck in
which she immortalised
the line “snap out of it!”,
won her the highly unde-
serving Oscar in 1988.
Looking amongst the five
nominated in the catego-
ry, (with Streep for Iron-
weed included) perhaps
the most outstanding
was Glenn Close in Fatal
Attraction. The Academy
voters clearly couldn’t
stomach the female vil-
lain who has made men
think twice about one-
night-stands.
