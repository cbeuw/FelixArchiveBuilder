Archbishop
There is something wrong with
people who aspire to be .Chris-
tians but are not Humanists, and
there are more difficulties than
solutions for those who claim to
be Humanists but not Christians.
This was the underlying mes-
sage conveyed by His Grace the
Archbishop of Canterbury when
he visited IC on Tuesday, 9 Feb-
ruary, to deliver a General Studies
lecture to an audience of 500 in
the main Physics Lecture Theatre.
Undoubtedly, this was the high-
light of the Anglican Chaplaincy's
Teaching Week.

Increase Grants!
While the present full term-
time grant to undergraduates is
deemed to be adequate, paid
work has tofinancethe vacations.
To those whose parents are un-
willing or unable to supplement
their grants, however, the Means
Test brings hardship, and its
abolishment is urged.
The differential between halls
and lodgings should be at least
reversed, and the London allow-
ance raised above Oxbridge.
National Insurance payments,
too, are condemned.
Postgraduates have a lower
standard of living than under-
graduates, and their present
grants are grossly inadequate. IC
Union calls for an exjra London
allowance, an annual increment,
increased demonstrating fees, and
a yearly review.
N.U.S. - WE'RE IN ?
"Scapegoat" Utting was exonerated, President Price flopped,
and the Imperial College joined, en masse, the National Union oi
Students in the most lively Union Meeting of the year last Thursday.
279 voted in favour of Mike Edwards' motion to join NUS, 215
opposed, 3 abstained, and five spoiled their ballot papers.
But this will certainly not be the last that ICU has heard of
NUS this term. 130 signatees will doubtless call for an Extraordinary
General Meeting within a month at which to reverse this decision.
In our last edition we criticised the pro-NUS team for their lack
of organisation. It would appear from the Union Meeting, however,
that those against ICU joining NUS have not even got a team, let
alone organisation. C. P. Burdess, who spoke first for the opposition,
was both unwilling and prepared to address the meeting. But no
arguments put either for or against the motion were novel.
AN EYE TO THE CLOCK
The decision to vote on NUS-membership came after a stormy
haF-hour sparked off by John Tutelman, ex-Chairman of the Jewish
Society, who, with an eye to the clock, said, " Now is the time to
stab." But Des Kearns, President of Mines, had other ideas, and
interposed, considering that the motion warranted a change in the
ICU constitution.
If this was so, then it was soon brought home to the Executive,
in particular by Angus Bentlev of 3ME, that the house, considered
them at fault for accepting the motion as otherwise when it was
tabled. Amid the tantrums, however, Dave Bishop, portly President
of-Guilds, nonchantly collected a stiff orange squash, which he diluted
with precision,
Opinion of his poor chairing was such that Norman Price was
forced to vacate the chair and submit his gown to Deputy President
Barry Mair. The change of leadership caused Kearns to withdraw
his motion, and the original motion was put to the vote.

Better Teaching
A controlled distribution of
lecture notes is advocated, so
allowing more emphasis to be ap-
plied to the understanding of the
subject. Better teachers, too, are
required.
There is a drastic need to lessen
the impersonal aspect of -higher
education by the encouragement
of personal tutorials and semi-
nars.
Silwood
Since UGC's last visit there has
been a 50 per cent, increase in
the number of students working
at Silwood Park. A can is now
put out for more residential ac-
commodation and increased
social and recreational facilities
there.
South Kensington
Halls of Residence must be
doubled in the next ten years.
Many small rooms for informal
club inee ings are wanted. A
hall to seat more than 300 people
will be built in the new College
Block.
The delay in the building of
the Sports Centre is condemned.
The four squash courts it will
house will be inadequate. Mori
than four tennis courts would be
welcome. And a large gymna-
sium area would be of immense
benefit; the basketball, badmin-
ton, volleyball, boxing, judo and
fencing clubs would gain a home
ground; netball and indoor tennis
could be played.
Two or three small soundproof
music rooms and a workshop are
also urgently required, D i w .
