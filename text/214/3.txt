THE MISFITS
by Chris Cooper
Now that (his College has adopted the Notting Hill Housing
Trust as its Carnival Charity, it is appropriate that we should hear
as much as possible of the dispossessed and outcast, and for the work
being done to help them. Homeless families are only part of those
being aided by the Simon Community, whose Director, Anton
Wallich-Cliffiord—plain " A n t o n " to the Community—spoke i» the
College during Christian Teaching Week.
There is a class of people—officially recognised i n Scandinavia
and parts of the U.S.—who are constitutionally incapable of rehabili-
tation as the Welfare State understands it—who, when they are
required to rely on themselves for survival in society, break-down and
become the meths-drinking down-and-outs of the bomb-sites and
doss-houses.
The Simon Community offers them a second,chance by taking
them first into its houses, like St. Joseph's, in Maiden Road, and then,
when they have progressed far enough, via a halfway house, to its
co-operative farm Simonwell.
At these places, helpers and
helped do not form a " we " and
" they "; they live alike, each get-
ting his £l-a-week pocket money.
These ventures are supported
by the voluntary contributions of
the "Companions of Simon,''
groups of private people all over
the country, and indeed, the
world; and more recently, by
Christian Action's " Homeless-in-
Britain " Fund.
,The Community do not like
"Society"; they say that it creates
the misfit, by demanding that the
individual should conform to it,
and not society to the individual.
Daily they are proving that other
ways of life are possible.
TRY A
STOMP...
The Southside Stomps are
really rather unique. Whether
you come to listen, to dance, or to
qrink, is irrelevant. What mat-
ters is that you relax and enjoy
the atmosphere, for there is some-
thing quite different about it—in
feet no other college jazz club I've
\ssited this term has bad this
essential atmosphere.
This week, is somewhat differ-
ent, too, in that three bands will
be playing during the evening, the
first being the lively traditional
style Royal Garden Stampers.
CHINESE SOCIETY
Music Night
After a series of successful
evenings on culture, home cuisine,
films and the New Year dinner,
the Chinese Society is going to
present another great and unique
item—a Musical Evening. This
will take place in the Upper Re-
factory, South Side at 8.30 p.m.
Monday, March 1st.
Entertainment will be provided
by 8 artists from Hong Kong and
Malaysia in a programme of
mostly Chinese Music, plus a few
extracts from Italian Operas. The
evening will have an Oriental at-;
mosphere and refreshment will be
served after the concert at a low
price. Come along and enjoy
yourself. Everybody isAvery wel-
come!
Other interesting evenings will
be organized by the Chinese So-
ciety in the near future. If you
are interested please refer ta our
notice board in the Union.
J E A N N E T C H A O
Later in the evening the Jazz
Congress will appear, and finally
a quartet led by a Tenor-Sax star
familiar to many in College—
Kelvin " H o p p y " Hopkins, who
now works in North London.
Come to the Stomp tonight for
the whole evening, or just pop in
for an hour between Brown-Bag-
ging sessions. Either way you will
enjoy it.

Holy Shroud
Group Captain Leonard Che-
shire, V.C., who was converted to
Catholicism as a result of his
being a witness to the dropping of
the first atom bombs, will talk to
the Catholic:
Society on Monday
March 1st at 5.15 p.m. in Mech.
Eng. 664. Founder of the Che-
shire Homes for the incurably sick
and husband of Sue Ryder, who
runs camps for disabled persons,
he will talk about "the Holy
Shroud of Turin."
This is a matter of controversy
in the Catholic Church since it is
claimed that the shroud Christ
was buried in, is in Turin Cathe-
dral. Leonard Cheshire believes
that the negative photographs of
this relic which reveals a man's
form does in fact prove this to be
the genuine " Holy Shroud."

HUXLEY
GROUP
Would you like to regard sex
as a moral influence? If so, Dr.
James Hemming might include it
in his " Ideology for Modern
Man " at the next Huxley Group
discussion on 11th March, at 7.30
in the Union Top Lounge. This
speaker was very interesting when
he addressed the London Young
Humanists last year. So, why not
give him a try?
AN
OPEN
INVITATION
The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks, are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU—;and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
