Harry, one or
the barmen in
the Union, left I.C.U. last Friday
after working here some 18
months, having found a more
lucrative post. Last Wednesday he
stated, "It's been nice working
here. If it wasn't for the tiresome
travelling and long hours, I'd still
go on."
Mrs. Barbara Castle, Minister
of Overseas Development, is to
oppose Mr. Enoch Powell in the
Debating Society's "No Confi-
dence in Her Majesty's Govern-
ment " Debate on Thursday, 18th
March.

Public Address Equipment is to
be bought for the Folk Song and
Jazz Clubs. The money is to
be made available by the Student
Finance Committee.
Within the next five years, the
furniture in the Union Lower
Lounge is to be replaced. Any
suggestions for the type of fur-
niture, or any minor structural
alterations to improve the layout
of the lounge should be sent to
B. Mair, Union Office.
Following the Council decision
last term, the Union Executive is
to go ahead with an I.C.U. hand-
book on similar lines to the
U.L.U. handbook. Probable cost,
approx. £200.
The production of Mike, the
new I.C. mascot, should start
soon. The cost has been approved
by the Union Executive.
Volunteers are needed to give

OXFORD KEEP LATIN
The Oxford dons have voted,
by 118 to 58, to keep Latin for,
all ceremonial functions. (It had
been proposed that in future,
English should be used). So much
for progressive thinking at our
frontiers of learning. With these
attitudes we're bound to keep up
with the Americans and Russians.
BEAVER PREDICTIONS
Among the predictions for-1965
in the L.S.E. Newspaper, Beaver,
are a lesbian orgy in the L.S.E.
T / V lounge, organized prostitu-
tion at the School of Oriental and
African Studies, the secession of
Aberystwyth from UCCA and its
subsequent reduction to 12 stu-
dents, and demonstrations at
Exeter against the compulsory
wearing of mortar boards.
CAMBRIDGE TO GO
COLOUR
Varsity, the Cambridge Univer-
sity Newspaper is to publish a
colour magazine at the end of next
term. It is the first such venture
by a British University Magazine
and it will consist of twenty pages
printed by photogravure. Already
it is expected to prove a giant loss.
COLOUR PREJUDICE AT
OXFORD
A survey of Oxford landladies
by the Oxford S.C.M., and Politi-
cal clubs has revealed that 62 per
cent, would not accept an appli-
cation from an African or Asian
Student. What would a similar
survey in London reveal, I won-
der?
U.C PAPER PROTEST
A letter in Pi, the U.C. News-
paper, from an indignant mother
condemns the sexational nature of
University papers, and also the
emphasis on drinking in student
activities. The article which
aroused the wrath was an inter-
view with a prostitute.
XMAS TREE THIEVES
At the end of last term students
of Bristol University removed a
20 ft. high Christmas Tree from
outside the Victoria Rooms,
Bristol. They left a sprig or fir
in its place. They are now paying
the price for their exploit in the
form of a £12 fine levied on mem-
bers of the men's hall of resi-
dence.
CHELSEA FIRE
After some electrical equipment
caught fire, producing clouds of
smoke, three fire engines were
called to Chelsea College. The
blaze was extinguished by a single
bucket of sand.
DEGREE WITH NO "O "
LEVELS
The University of Sussex has
offered nine places to applicants
without accepted qualifications.
The Successful applicants, who
did not even have " O "-Levels,
appear to be progressing as well
as their colleagues with " A " -
Level qualifications. They were
selected by interviews, tutorial
style and on the merits of essays
they wrote on books they elected
to read.
RUMBLED
The latest issue of Beaver
rejoices in the fact that someone
outside L.S.E. reads it, whilst
accusing yours truly of cribbing
material from Beaver. Well, it
least it shows that someone out-
side I.C. reads Felix.

UNION MEETING CONTINUED
LECTURING METHODS
A lecturing methods conference between any and all interested
members of staff and students will take place on the second Wed-
nesday of the summer term. It will be chaired by Professor Neal of
the Mechanical Engineering department, though final details have
to be arranged by the President. A number of objections were voiced
to the proposition, put by Keith Cavanagh, student chairman of
ICAScW, but were poorly reflected in the voting.
PLANNED ENTERTAINMENT
There was no opposition, however, to constitutional changes
being made to the Entermtainments Committee so as to include the
Presidents of the Folk Song, Jazz and Film Societies. To be brought
into force this motion must receive a two-thirds majority at the next
Union Meeting.
AACHEN SCHOLARSHIP
Most important of Secretary's Utting's correspondence was the
offer of a 350 Deutschmarks-per-month scholarship to Aachen Uni-
versity for a year to, particularly, someone active in Union affairs.
Applications, -to be made in the Union Office, close on 1st March.
