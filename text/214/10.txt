Fives Hockey Cup Final
AT LAST
By I. Collins
On the \\th of Feb. at the
Hampstead courts, I.C. played
University College School Old
Boys. The Old Boys have had
a good season, and have beaten
several sides who in turn have
beaten I.C., and perhaps it was
the knowledge of this that pro-
duced a more even, balanced
game from both the I.C. strings
than they have previously pro-
duced.
The pattern of the first game of
the first set was maintained all
evening; first one side would
gain the service advantage, a few
points, and then lose a few hands
and allow the other Jeam to go
ahead. After this first game had
gone to 12-11 for I.C.,-we had
anticipated a long struggle, but
gradually the Old Boys were worn
into making mistakes. The fol-
lowing games reflected this as-
cendency, for I.C. drew ahead on
Doints. the final results being a
long awaited win for I.C., by 90
points to 49 and 8 games to nil.
Neither of the strings were
in attacking mood,.and tended to
be content with a tight, consistent
defence which inevitably drives
opponents to take risks in attack.
While this was a successful ap-
proach on this occasion, both
strings need to pay more thought
to the placing of attacking shots.
Thus, 3 months after their first
matches, I.C. are now playing
close to their best potential, and
it is very satisfy to see two such
good results as this one and the
match of a fortnight ago against
U.C.
Volley Ball
Moral Victory
for I.C.
By M. H. Ahari
EC's newly founded Volley-
ball Club took on Southgate T . &
the champions of S.E. England, in
their first match.
Although I.C. lost, the result
was a moral-victory. It took I.C.
a long time to settle and stop
losing points from services hitting
the low ceiling, and before this
could be achieved the first game
was lost.
It was apparent that I.C. need
experience and more team work.
The final result was 2-1 against
I.C. with scores 7-15^15-11,11-15.
There will be another match on
Thursday, 25th Feb. against
Lycee! Francais. I.C. are now
arranging morefixtureswith other
clubs with a return match against
Southgate in the summer.
Team: M. Ghanai (capt.), M. H.
Ahari, C. N. Khoo, F. T. Nadir, F.
Saitaabi, I. Nedjat, C. W. Chia.
CUP DAY
By E. Needham
The first week in March is the
week the Hockey Club have been
building up to for the whole of the
season.
On Wednesday, March 3rd the
Cup Final takes place against
West Ham; every member of the
team is geared to this match, and
is looking forward to the possi-
bility of celebrating a victory for
the first time in four years, at the
Hockey Club dinner next day.
The path to the final had only
one great hurdle—the quarter-
final match against C.E.M. which
L C won 2-1. As always a
terrific spirit fired the match with
really top class hockey. I.C. won
because, although the Cemian
forwards had some brilliant indi-
viduals, the I.C. forwards linked
up well, and were consequently
much more effective.
I.C.'s chances are good. The
defence has been firm most of this
season, centre-half Ray Phillips
should prove a solid answer to
West Ham's-star-studded forward
Fencing
line ana the rest of the half-back
linewill be strengthened by Black-
heath player Anketell, who has a
great natural ability and fitness.
The forward line remains the
enigma. I.C. always seems to
rely^on Hough and Stenning to
score individual goals. If,they
can do this in the final, the for-
ward line could then begin to
work together, and make the
victory complete.
Indeed, a victory on March 3rd
would be a fitting goodbye for the
President of the Hockey Club,
Mr. A. Stevenson, who is retiring
from the post after rendering his
services since 1939.

F R E E COACHES will leave
the Union at 1.15 p.m. on Wed-
nesday, 3rd March, for the
Hockey Cup Final at Motspur
Park. Supporters will be more
than welcome and should sign
the lists outside the Bar and in
the Main Entrance Hall. A good
win in the afternoon should lead
to an excellent evening's enter-
tainment.
Table Tennis
Cup Run Ended
By J. Greenwood
The successful run of the first
team in the Cup ended in the
semi-final against a strong team
from Northern Poly. In a fine
match I.C. went down 4-5. The j
first team has now finished its
league programme and has. been
beaten only once and will prob-
ably finish second in the league
table. In the last few matches of
the season the second and third
teams should just avoid relegation
in their respective divisions.
Shooting
Convincing Win R i d i n g H i g h
By D. Scott
The first match this term was
against Risinghill, which LC. lost
6-3,but-the team had a convincing
win on Tuesday, Feb. 16th,
against Chelsea, winning both
sabre and foil, 6-3, 6-3. B. A .
Lovett, D. J. Scott, and W. A .
White fought in the Sandhurst
open electric foil competition on
Sat. 13th Feb., all three reaching
the quarter final. M. A. White-
did well to reach the semi-final.
By J. Dimmock
Now that the winter season of
inter-college small-bore shooting
has nearly finished it can be seen
that I.C. rifle club has done very
well.
The Pistol team (I. P. Free-
man, J. Coombs, D. H . Davies)
has been outstanding, winning all
its nine matches to finish top of
the 1st division in the London
University Leagues. In their last
match the team set up a new Uni-

WE WANT MORE
On March 9th, the University'Grants Committee comes to I.C.
It is a surprising fact but with academic buildings expanding at a_
great rate, the college has plans for little expansion of sports facili-
ties in South Kensington. Apart from the Sports Centre there is
nothing, yet a great deal is needed.
The " M E M O R A N D U M F R O M T H E UNION " contains a very
sensible section on recreational facilities—to quote "Although the
sports ground at Harlington is excellent and very much appreciated,
it is of necessity too far away for casual activity. Some students do
not wish to play organised games, but if facilities are readily avail-
able will spend a couple of hours each week playing squash, tennis,
swimming or gymnastic sports (basketball and volleyball, etc.)."
The main requirement is obviously a gymnasium, large enough
to accommodate badminton, basketball and volleyball courts. The
present gymnasium is ridiculously overcrowded and. storage space is
totally inadequate, even for a dojo, weight-training apparatus and
fencing gear.
The. tennis and fives courts ih Princes Gardens will some time
disappear; the popularity of the former indicates that more than
two will be needed in the future. Much attention must be paid to
storage space—for instance a boxing ring, dojo, gymnastic vaulting
apparatus, etc., pose quite extensive problems and perhaps planning
for more than four showers for the whole gamut of clubs would be a
little- more realistic.
. The Union must impress upon the U.G.C. that Vve are crying
out for these facilities and that (to quote) . . . "With a curriculum
as full as our own, especially for postgraduates, such activi.ies which
are economical of time and space assume a major importance."
versity record 535 ex 600, beating
the old record by 10 points. The
Pistol " B " team is 4th in Division
2.
The Standing and Kneeling
" A " team (J. Dimmock, V .
Coombs, I. P. Freeman) has won
8 out of 9 matches and is top of
the 1st Division* while the " B "
team is 3rd in the 1st Division.
In a recent " S & K " match in
which London University beat
Cambridge, 4 out of the team of
6, plus the reserve, were from I.C.
In the conventional prone
events, with one match to shoot,
the " A " team is 2nd in Division 1
and the " B " team is top of
Division 2, both-?fe*ams having
won all.their matches this term.
Some remarkable shooting has
been produced by R. D. Kennett
who hag an average of 99.8 ex
100, having dropped only 3 points
in 17 matches shot this season for
I.C.
