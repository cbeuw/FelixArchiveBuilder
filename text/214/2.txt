Race - S. African Style
South Africa is trying to show the world that it has found a
solutipnto the problem of race relations and that partition will work.
But the South Africa form of partition is not one in which both sides
have complete autonomy as in Ireland, India, and Germany, but
rather where the " black " partition area is subservient to the " white "
central government.
The Rt. Rev. Joost de Blank, formerly Anglican Archbishop of
Capetown was speaking to an audience of 250 in General Studies on
Thursday, 11th February.
A number of ways of overcoming racial problems have been
implemented with varied success. The founding fathers of America
saw fit to exterminate the indigenous ancestors, and deprive those
who survived of any rights. In Australia exclusion, in particular of
yellow peoples, has been practised (their immigration laws are now
somewhat more lax). In recent years territorial partition has been
adopted as a working compromise, but has never been regarded as
an ideal permanent settlement.
For a century the United States
tried to maintain a " separate
but equal" policy for whites and
blacks. But they found that those
already privileged tended to gain
extra privileges and those who
were under-privileged lost. -' Ten
years ago the Federal Court ruled
that " all men were equal," but
its implementation has been
stormy.
"The South African govern-
ment is prepared to accept the
word ' separate' by not ' equal.'
Black South Africans in white
areas of the country have virtu-
ally no rights and certainly no
chance of expressing their griev-
ances ; only in black areas may
they make themselves heard at
municipal level.
Bishop de Blank sympathised
with the firmly entrenched white
minority in that South Africa was
their homeland and that they
were terrified of being submerged
by the biack majority. To retain
their identiy they resort to threats
of force, apartheid, and every
means open to them.
The next point at issue will be
the decision of the International
Court of Justice oh the sover-
eignty of South-West Africa this
autumn. The S.A. Government
has pledged that it will accept me
Court's decision if it goes against
them, but with the border re-
tracted 800 miles the core will be
strengthened. Increased world
opinion against S.A. policies will
unite the British and Boers in a
common resolve favouring apar-
theid. They would rather see the
whole system come down in
flames around them like Hitler's
bunker than change.
However, he insisted that it
was very important to convince
the black South Africans that the
rest of the white world does not
nece-snrily agree with the S.A.
Government; such a means of
communication is still open.
Regarding his own exit from
S.A., Bishop de Blank empha-
sised the courtesy shown him by
civil servants though his relations
with government ministers had
not always been as happy as they
might; he was glad to say that
he had never been threatened
with arrest.

RAMSEY
(from front page)
Dr. Ramsey went on to give a
map of the Christian's view of
man and another of the Human-
ist's view, and to consider the
conditions under which the two
views did and did not overlap.
We are God's creatures; God
created the world and formed
man in His own image. Thus, he
said, there: is not only a line of
distinction but also a likeness be-
tween man and his creator. The
Christian acts always in creaturely
humility, not towards any aggraa>
disement of himself, his neigh-
bours, race or nation, but in the
mutual service of the world.
Man's goal is to seek perfect fel-
lowship with God, and while in
this world he must learn, under-
stand and control the process of
nature in a fitting manner.
As a creed Humanism has
seen three classical epochs. In
the first, the Greek, the attitude
was summed up by Sophocles—
" Many things are marvellous but
nothing is more wonderful than
man." In the Renaissance and
the |resent day Humanism has
been revived and enhanced'by the
development of science; today "If
a man can emancipate himself
from superstitions and increase
knowledge of himself and the
world, then he will increase his
own happiness and discover the
good life."
ink, No Wheels!
Mechanical devices always work whereas electrical ones . .
This was one of the many maxims cited toy Professor Laithwaite at
his inaugural lecture on Tuesday, 16th February.
The Lecture was accompanied by many demonstrations, " which
will be done in ascending order of danger, so that if we fuse the lights
you will only miss the end of the lecture." If anyone ever considered
Power Electrical Engineering to be a dead subject they would have
been convinced otherwise by Professor Laithewaite.
Professor Laithwaite worked at the Royal Aircraft Establish-
ment during the war. He became an Undergraduate in 1946 at
was interviewed
Manchester (he
by Sir Willis Jackson )and went
on to research in digital compu-
ters.
Professor Laithwaite gave the
impression that Tie could make
any subject interesting, but when
talking about his pet subject,
linear motors, he excelled himself.
He began by discussing the opera-
tion of an ordinary induction
motor, and then with the aid of a
rubber model motor (which he
unzipped to much laughter), he
ex-plained the transition to a
linear motor. He later fired ah
iron stake from a tubular linear
motor into a chunk of wood. " I
don't give much for the chances
of the people in the front row."
He enlarged on the development
work done on the linear motor
while he was at Manchester. He
showed some slides of the first
one he had set up; it was equipped
with a seat " Because if you can't
enjoy work what is the point of
doing it." With a maximum
speed of 25 mph and an accelera-
tion of " i g " with a 200 lb person
on it, the machine was fast
enough for an 80 ft. laboratory!
We were then shown a film of the
motor he developed in conjunc-
tion with British Rail, which
clearly showed the fantastic ac-
celeration that can be obtained
using linear motors.
Finally he demonstrated the
levitation experiments he has also
shown on T.V. By now the
demonstrations were taking very
high currents. " This coil takes
90 amps—we are only fuSed for
60 amps." This was the best
inaugural lecture I have ever at-
tended and if the applause was
anything to go by, many others
people must also have thought so.
AJ.O.
Non-Christian Humanism the
Archbishop illustrated as a beau-
tiful picture of all the wonderful
propositions to attain happiness
framed with a misleading inscrip-
tion—"And this is all." the
Christian Humanist rejects this
frame, for this is NOT all.
. While religion does tell many
truths it cannot tell all. Any
science that is sincerely seeking
the truth has been created by
God's will. Conversely, no single
science is omnicompetent to ex-
plain man, the world or the uni-
verse. Psychiatry is of consider-
able help to people with certain
aberrations, but alone it cannot
provide a complete solution to
their problems. The " other
worldly" aspect of Christianity
may be used as a form of escap-
ism; but this is false religion, just
as there can be false use of
science.
Quesioned of the modernity of
moral-thinking in the Church, Dr.
Ramsey stated that it must go
through periods of evolution in
line with scientific discoveries.
Thd question of birth control has
to be integrated with marital laws.
In regard to Leo Abse's bill, he
felt sympathy with those who suf-
fered hardships through separa-
tion, but was not prepared to
cheapen marriage by making it
not a life-long contract but one
that may be broken at will.
