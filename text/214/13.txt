The sound and f u r y of the whole
business,- which .probably took the av-
erage Union Member by s u r p r i s e , seem to
leave a f e e l i n g of complete d i s a t i s f a c t -
ion. Even Edwards, the proposer of the
o r i g i n a l motion, was unhappy. E v e r y t h i n g
seemed t o have .gone wrong on both s i d e s ,
and , a f c e r the i n i t i a l h y s t e r i a , no-
body soer
:iod t c be q u i t e sure what to
do about i t . Nevertheless p a r t i t i o n s
are underway. I t should, be an easy ma-
t t e r t o get the necessary 150 s i g n a t u r e s
needed t o c a l l an e x t r a o r d i n a r y general'
