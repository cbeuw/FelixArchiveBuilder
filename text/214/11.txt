The 17th Hyde Park Rood Relay
By D . A . Bonham
This coming Saturday, 27th
February, I.C. is holding th the
most important event in its sport-
ing calendar; I.C. will once
again be acting as host to 90 Col-
leges and Universities. The occa-
sion will be the 17th Annual Invi-
tation Hyde Park Road Relay,
the largest of its standard any-
where in the world.
More than 500 runners—six to
a team—will run a 3 mile lap of
the park, among them will be as
usual some of the famous names
of athletics and also potential in-
ternationals.
Entries include all the first 15
in the recent U.A.U. champion-
ships: J. M . Jackson, Liverpool,
Fergus Murray, Edinburgh, Yates
—U.C., S. P. Mikell, last year top
junior 3 miler, and the inevitable
M . Turner who first entered in
1960 and holds the lap record.
The race was originally thought
up by 3 I.C. runners—T. Watts
(7 times 440 yds. Champ.) R.
Gigg (who ran the fastest lap in
the inaugural race), and A .
Br6wn.
I.C. won that first race in 1949
from a field of eight others !
Interest in the event grew
rapidly. By 1954 there were 27
entries including two or three
Oxbridge Colleges (thus making
it socially acceptable]) Big names
began to appear in the pro-
gramme; that year Martin Hyman
ran for Southampton University
at the start of a career which led
to international and Olympic per-
formances and the U.K. 6 anile
record.
In 1959 I.C. came second to
Liverpool out of a field of 42.
In doing so they beat a very
formidable team from Southamp-
ton which contained both Hyman
and Bruce Tulloh. Ron Hill,
U.K. 6 mile record, also entered
that year for the firsj time with
Manchester University. The entry
shot up in the next two years.
1960 saw 70 teams line up for the
start, among them an all-blue
team from St. Catharine's Oxford
and individuals such as Tulloh,
Turner (who again broke the lap
record last year), Tim Briault and
T. Shoefield. Durham actually
won and I.C. were 4th.
The following year there oc-
curred one of the most exciting
races. I.C. in the form of J.
Collins took a five second lead at
the end of the fourth lap, and J.
Cleator running next, put up the
third fastest time of the day and
increased the gap to 30 sees.
However, Hill and Turner run-
ning for Manchester and Queen's
(Cambridge) respectively pro-
duced the two fastest laps of the
day, overtaking G. Wenk, I.C.'s
last man, and so pushing the Col-
lege team into 3rd place.
Revenge came the very next
year when I.C. won for the first
time since 1949. There was a
record field of 80 including stiff
opposition such as Leeds, Man-
chester and Nottingham. In fact
Leeds had a 37 sec. lead at the.
start of the last lap—but Collins
again produced the third fastest
lap taking (and keeping) the lead
\ a mile from home.
The great Herb Elliot was yet
another famous athletic perspna-
lity to take part—this must have
been his last serious race before
his premature retirement due to
studies and a controversy over bis
amateur status.
During the years 1949-62 I.C.
were always in the first six. Un-
fortunately in the last couple of
years much of the talent which un-
doubtedly lies within the college
cannot find the time to take part
in sport, and the position of I.C.
dropped to 31st in 1963 and 1964.
This years I.C. team, which
will probably consist of D. May,
A . Cope, H . Dickson, A . Bishop,
A. Walker and a sixth member,
who could be chosen from any of
half a dozen, although not in the
winning class will undoubtedly
improve on recent performances.

LOSS OF CUP
" So near and yet so far," was
the only thought of forty an-
guished I.C. supporters as .Chap-
pell was pulled down inches from
the line in the dying moments, of
this Gutteridge Cup semi %»al.
But these were the inches between
victory and defeat for moments
later the final whistle brought an
end to I.C.'s cup hopes for this
season and Q.M.C. had nosed
home by the narrow margin of

davison injured
There can be no doubt that the
LC. back division was badly dis-
organised by an early injury to
Davi$on but even taking this into
account the defence was shaky
arid frequently only forward cov-
ering stopped a break through.
Here Hanjmerton was outstanding
and in fact in attack and defence
must have covered more ground
than any other player on the field.
The pack more than held its
own in the scrums but the line-
OUts were another matter, for
Water Polo
Convincing Victory
By S. Rowe
The I.C. water-polo success
story continues apace. Collins led
his men to a convincing victory
over a bewildered Bristol Univer-
sity side. Bristol were probably
not only worried by I.C.'s superioi
"watermanship but also by the
small dimensions of the Great
Smith Street Pool which I.C. have
been forced to use this term. The
confined space favoured some of
I.C.'s less speedy but more robust
players.
I.C. recently scored two league
wins in the larger U.L.U. pool
where swimming ability is more
important. In the first match
Guy's scored a quick goal which
stirred I.C. out of their lethargy.
The irrepressible Stapley equal-
ised with a long range shot in the
second quarter. Randall and
Rowe shared the remaining I.C.
goals. Valentine scored three
very skilfully placed goals for
Guy's. Throughout the match
Gray and Davis played well as
backs for I.C.
The last match, versus St.
Mary's was a shambles. I.C. won
this match 5-3 against a poor side,
they must not rest on their laurels
too muchr
Results:
1st 5-3 Guy's
10-1 Bristol University.
5-2 St. Mary's Hospital.
while Q.M.C. were frequently
employed by the unorthodox and
risky tactic of tapping down to
the scrum half, I.C. seemed to
gain possession only to loose five
yards, and the ball, in the melee
that followed. Even before the
exploitation of this session's new
rules, set line out techniques have
been a fundamental of forward
play, but these only come with
practice, a thing that I.C. sadly
lack in this department.
a foot short
However, an the jcredit side
this was a game that could have
easily gone either way and in the
loose the I.C. forwards were re-
markably mobile and dangerous.
As the game progressed luck
seemed against both teams.
Q.M.C. going near with a penalty
that hit the cross bar while Turton
after a dummy scissors and a fine
run almost went over in the
corner. However, there was no
score until just on half time. Then
from a line out some 30 yards
out Weisner executed the same
move as against U.C. linking up
with Davis and Metcalf for the
latter to score an excellent try,
well converted by Turner. With
this lead I.C. exerted early pres-
sure after the restart but Q M C
weathered the storm, and slowly
turned defence into attack to score
some 15 mins. from time—then
from a Touch near I.C. line
Weisner received the ball and half
of the QMC pack at once and out
of the resulting maul a Q M C
forward dived over, The tempo
now rose to fever pitch where
it remained as with five minutes to
go the QMC scrum half sent his
side in front with a well-taken
penalty goal. Turner and the
rest of his team promptly threw
everything into a last desperate
attack sustained alas, in vain until
the end.
