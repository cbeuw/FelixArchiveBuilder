Exploration
Society
F E L I X
The I.C. Exploration Society is reputed to be the most active
society of the type in the country. Yet the average student at I.C.
may find this hard to believe, for the society does little to publicise
its activities within the coUege.
Several meetings are held each term to which guest speakers
are invited. In principle, these meetings also provide a platform on
which people with common interests can meet each other to exchange
ideas and information. In practice there is little opportunity for
informal discussion; but the annual dinner in February does much
to stimulate social activity within the society.
THE EXPLORATION BOARD
Naturally enough the society centres around the organisation of
expeditions. Details of proposed expeditions are made available to
members; and if there is enough support a detailed report Of the
aims and cost of the expedition is prepared. This is submitted to
the Exploration Board, who undertake to give financial assistance,
where possible, provided they are satisfied that the expedition is
going to undertake scientific work (thinly disguised revelry is not
acceptable!).
Because the Board have only limited funds at their disposal they
insist that detailed proposals must be submitted to them by Decem-
ber 8th each year, so that expedition organisers can know well in
advance just how much assistance they will receive. To ease the
financial situation and to discourage frivolity every member of an
expedition is expected to provide a minimum of £50 out of his own
pocket. Society would stand to become

of several other facilities laid on
by the Society. A certain amount
of equipment (tents, sleeping bags,
ice picks, etc.), is loaned and pro-
visions are bought in bulk at dis-
count prices. Much information
is also available as to which firms
are generous with their compli-
mentary samples.
On their return, expeditions
are required to prepare a sum-
mary report of their investiga-
tions by November, and a full re-
port must be drawn up during the
following year. The summary
reports, which are particularly
useful to the organisers of future
expeditions, are made available
to members of the society, and
the full reports eventually come
to rest in the Haldane Library.
ASTOTJNDINGLY SMALL
For a college of this size, the
membership of the Exploration
Society's is astonishingly small.
(Last year there were only 35
members.) The Society is at pre-
sent trying to attract stronger
support by inviting famous per-
sonalities (e.g. Sir John Hunt) to
speak at their meetings, and by
aiming to produce a bigger and
better version of their already ex-
cellent Exploration Review.
But perhaps they would also do
well to review their publicity ar-
rangements. The impressive at-
tendance at their recent talk on
" Survival" demonstrated just
how effective good publicity can
be. If as much publicity Were
given to proposals -for forth-
coming expeditions, then no
doubt the membership figures of
the Society would begin to reflect
the students natural interest in
foreign travel. And if, for ex-
ample, an informal discussion
over coffee could be organised
after each meeting so that mem-
bers really could get to know
each other, the Exploration

WELLSSOC
Feb. I5th-^—•£/nidentified Flying
Objects, by Mr. Gordon Creigh-
ton (ex-British Intelligence).
The large and initially sceptical
audience was visibly impressed
by Mr. Creightoitfs all but con-
clusive evidence for the presence
of extra terrestial craft on our
planet
A Texas policeman on patrol
saw a large object off the road
at a lonely spot on his route. On
approaching the object on foot he
judged it to be about sixty foot
long and standing on four canti-
levered legs. Three short human
looking individuals entered the
craft on his approach, and the
craft took off with a huge belch
of flame. Investigators returned
to the spot and found a burnt
patch in the scrub and four in-
dentations substantiating the
policeman's statement and con-
curring with his estimate of the
size of the craft.
The cnances that a normal and
wholly reliable person should per-
petrate such a fraud are small,
and though many obviously
fraudulent reports are made, the
enormous frequency of reports
from varied sources around the
ing to get people used to the
possibility of the visits of intelli-
gent extra-terrestial life, but in the
free world the restrictions are
severe. A n American air force
pilot may for instance get up to
ten years in prison for disclosing
any information on sighted
U.F.Os. In Brazil, at the con-
clusion'of a military survey into
the matter the officer presenting
the resulting evidence has declared
that itelligent extra-terrestial visi-
tations may be accepted as a re-
ality.
The cumulative effect of th§
evidence put by Mr. Creighton
was quite overwhelming and
really cannot be dismissed off-
hand. The dangers of U.F,Os,
triggering off a nuclear war also
provide a very real threat. A
Russian Engineer's report tells of
an occasion when two banks of
ground to air missiles were fired
at some unidentified flying objects
and both exploded simultaneously
far short of their targets.
The only thing that seemed
somewhat unconvincing was Mr.
world (about 1 in 24 hours) could Creighton's manner which implied
not be totally ficticious. Mr. h i s complete belief in TJ.KOs.

Carnival Lunches are going
moderately well—the main trou-
ble is that most of those voluteers
who promised to sell tickets have
forgotten or vanished ! There are
usually a few left with Stan or
in the Union cloakroom, so
there's no need to be disappointed
on a Friday. The music improves
every week. Why not come along
one Friday luochtime ?—-Concert
Hall, 1 to 2 p.m. (some food is
kept back for late arrivals!).
Good news! The Carnival
Office is now open from 12.30 to
2 p.m. every lunchtime. Even
if you haven't any brilliant ideas
why not just drop in one lunch-
time—we'll soon find something
for you to do ?

MR.ICWA
Wednesday 17, evening.
Dick Potts, a second year
Miner, was elected next year's
Mr. I.C.W.A. tonight. Mr.
I.C.W.A. is the male representa-
tive on the I.C.W.A. Committee
of the 120 lady members of the
College.
His responsibilities include
assisting in the preparations of
various I.C.W.A. functions during
the year, having particular charge
of the bar. He enlists the help of
other males of the college to help
decorate the Concert Hall for the
I.C.W.A. Formal in March.
He used to be guardian of the
fish tank, and these duties will be
restored when fish are returned to
the aquarium in the near future.
Also in his favour is that fact that
he is the only man who may not
be forcibly removed from the
I.C.W.A. lounge.
