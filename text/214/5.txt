F E L I X 5
Carnival
Dick Smith and his all-star
group, the R.C.S. ents. committee,
have put in a lot of effort to make
this the best Carnival ever, not
to mention Fletcher and his caba-
ret writers (remember â€” don't
mention Fletcher). Let's support
their efforts to make this more
than an ex ended hop by turning
out in appropriate dress. The
game this week is "guess the
theme." Reserve Friday, March
5th, for the Carnival and Satur-
day for a good kip.
Union Mee'.ing
The President's efforts to con-
fuse us into thinking we'd voted
not to debate but to discuss the
motion that " R.C.S. Union offers
nothing to the majority of its
members". failed,when the Zoo-
logy Rep. treated us to one of his
V6rbal bombasts (bombast=in-
flated talk; verbal bombast=twice
as much inflated talk). Wal op-
posed, then Needham decided to
propose it. W E voted that the
motion be put, voted that it
should not be put off and pro-
ceeded to the next item on the
agenda. Objections, apd the mo-
tion was put. Wal opposed a
second time but the seconder of
press themselves in, more enter-
tainments in I.C., and, by compe-
tition, a sp"ur to excel rather than
plod complacently. I think the
gentleman was thinking of the
inquorate I.C.U. Meeting, when
he said, " Let's niake one good
Union." I.C. is too big to have
the spirit of the Constituent Col-
lege Unions. It is, of necessity,
too formal and serious to entice
our younger members into par-
ticipating. Mascot-whipping may
not be the most beneficial activity,
but at least it's a start.
A t the end of it all the abundant
opportunities offered to those pre-
pared to put some effort in, had
been made very clear by the Sec.
and his assistant. The motion was
defeated unanimously.
Furzedown
The R.C.S. party seemed to be
enjoyed by all whowent especially
the teachers-to-be, apparently due
to a shortage of men in Tooting.
Trip to the coast next term?
Rumour and publicity even,
held that this was to be a tramps
ball. Response to this nomen-
clature was interesting, Bruce
Copper in particular excelled.
However the girls thought it war
just a party. Strange looks wcre;
Scene from Union Meeting
the motion decided to discuss it.
The assistant Sec. ably seconded
the opposition again and some
interesting but irrelevant speeches
followed from the floor.
After three attempts, the new
Maths and Physics Soc. President
convinced us all of who he was.
He told us of the past chaos of the
Society, and forecast a new era
of Maths and Fizzing. Let us hope;
that he can live up to it.
Another gentleman questioned
the necessity for Constituent Col-
lege Unions at all. The meeting
decided to ignore him. Apart from
the basis in tradition, surely we
need the three Unions. We need
small manageable units, where
people know each other, can par-
ticipate more easily, and benefit
from the experience. They mean
more activities and more respon-
sible jobs for the willing to ex-
our lot for some twenty minutes
until the explanation went round;
the barrels felt this most though.
Exit Wal for" n " pipkins at 9.30.
A swinging evening marred only
by the unknown gentlemen(?)
who chose to hide one of our six
crates in the bog and consume it
there. Our thanks to Brian Ray
for the music.
P.S. Our numbers were somewhat
depleted on return.
News-sheet
Just for R.C.S. and one penny
a time, this will be edited and
published spasmodically by Pete
Finch (New Beit 88). Any news,
hot gossip, your pal's achieve-
ments or anything of particular
interest to R.C.S. will be wel-
come. A volunteer distributor is
needed too.
