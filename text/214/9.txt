Dear
Don't w a t c h television?
Dear Sir,
With refererce to the letter in the last issue from Peter Finch,
concerning the College television sets, receiving only two programmes,
we, the undersigned, students of the Operational Research Group,
would like to point out that we were so busy trying to obtain an
M.Sc.(Eng.) in 12 months, that we have no time to watch television,
and were therefore, unaware of the problem.
If, however, the Union wishes to engage us as consultants to solve
the problem, we might seriously consider the proposition.
Yours sincerely,
(Production Engineering and Management Studies Section).

Dear Sir,
Undeterred by the many voices
i raised in protest after his last
[column, Chris Lamparti continues
in the same vein in your issue of
January 11th.
Mr. Lampard apparently ex-
pects the idea of expressing
solidarity with the oppressed
youth of South Africa and Rho-
desia to amuse his readers, it does
not amuse me. It does not amuse
many other people.
Mr. Lampard's ignorance of
Southern lAfrica is nicely illus-
trated by his incorrect description
of the territory between tlie Lim-
popo and the Zambezi as South-
emilRhodesia. If this philistine
is to continue as your " Foreign
Affairs" correspondent, you
might at least buy him an up-to-
date atlas.
Yours sincerely,
ROY CLARKE
(Secretary, ICSFRE).
Ed.—Contributions to M r Lam-
pard's atlas fund will be gratefully
received!

Dear Sir,
I have been asked by the Natio-
nal Blood Transfusion Service to
convey their sincere thanks to all
who gave their blood at the recent
session. In all, they collected 426
donations from the 478 volun-
teers. Twelve special donations
were collected for a" hole-in-the-
heart" operation that was success'
fully completed on the Tuesday
afternoon. Others were rushed to
an emergency operation in West
Brampton Hospital.
The percentage attendance for
all I.C. (including P4J.S) was
13.7 per cent, Mines 9\5 per cent,
Guilds 13.8 per cent, R.C.S. 14.9
per cent. Females 26,8 per cent,
Males 13/1 percent.
Yours smcerety,
N. C. GRAVETTE,
(Chetti. Eng. PG.)
With reference to the com-
plaints from Colcutt and Mr. J.
Cawson in today's issue, that
letter racks are becoming filled
with circulars, may I suggest that
these gentlemen enquire as to the
cause of this phenomenon.
The societies that indulge in
this type of publicity are driven to
it by a lack of alternative means.
The notice boards in the Union
and other areas are too often
crowded with posters either oc-
cupying far more than their share
of space, or lacking the publicity
officer's stamp of approval. One
half session has gone by without
the appearance of new notice
boards—please note that the so-
cieties named by Mr. Cawson
have notice boards in the most
obscure comers — and indeed
there is little evidence that a Pub-
licity Officer exists.
Felix itself is little help—a
" What's On" column, giving
the next fortnight'.s meetings and
events, would surely contribute
to the solution of the publicity
problem, and what is more, pro-
vide a real service to readers,
putting an end to their depend-
ence on an irregular and' un-
reliable Broadsheet.
Yours faithfully,
J. GROUT,
(Keogh Hall)
Ed.—Last October Felix offered
to publish the Union Broadsheet
as a fortnightly supplement, so
alleviating the Union Executive
of the burden of its production;
The offer was refused, however,
and the member of our staff, who
was willing to execute this task,
now fulfills a different function
on the newspaper.
Dear Sir,
At the end of last month three
notices about the exhibition held
by the Indian j$bciety, were un-
authorisedly reijtoved well before
the closing date. They were:
1. A hand-written notice on the
Union Noticeboard.
2. AJtand-written notice and a
picture of Tajmahal on
Southside Noticebmrd.
3. A picture of a Kashmiri girl
near the Mech. Eng. Dept.
There is no doubt that the last
two were stolen as they were at-
tractive. We feel that these mis-
deeds were performed by some-
one in the College even though
one may say that the poster out-
side the Mech. Eng. Dept. could
have been taken by anyone. Wfur-
ever the person or persons con-
cerned were, they should have
had the common sense to ap-
proach us whereby many more
could have been obtained, besides
not having any guilt of stealing.
It is all the more annoying as they
were not allowed to serve their
purpose. One would expect the
stuaants of a. highly r'espected
institute to be less selfish.
...The most surprising of all was
the removal of the hand written
notices. • The picture and the
notice disappeared on consecutive
days from the Southside Notice-
board. These have produced a
serious case which is not in line
for a happy union life. We hope
these mistakes will not be re-
peated.
To think of it, what a risk it is
to arrange an exhikiiion. even at
imperial CollegeX
Yours faithfully,
