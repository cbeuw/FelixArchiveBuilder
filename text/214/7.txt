GRANTS INADEQUATE
Norman Price
and David Williams report
All year representatives were asked to submit written reports
of their year's views on lectures, tutorials, practical periods, vacation
courses, grant sufficiencies and anomalies and any other matters of
concern.
At a Union meeting the invitation was extended to anyone, to
express his views on the Union Office. These opinions together with
the written evidence formed the basis of a memorandum on teaching
methods and grants that went to U.G.C., and a letter on grants that
went to SAOG.
ACADEMIC MATTERS
Many problems were particular to one department and will be
dealt with by the appropriate bodies in the Constituent Colleges.
Examples of such problems are the desire for more discussion of
written laboratory reports in Chemical Engineering and the suggestion
from Mechanical Engineering postgraduates for the provision of
a postgraduate common room with refreshment facilities, like
that in the Physics department,
which would make a valuable
contribution to the departmental
and social environment. The
machinery for dealing with such
cases already exists in the year
rep. system and most departments
are willing to discuss sensible and
responsible suggestions.
Other problems are more
general and appropriate for com-
ment by the College authorities
and UGC. Opinions in this cate.
gory include the need for more
contact between students and
staff possibly in the form of per-
sonal tutorials and seminars ; the
desirability that more real atten-
tion and less lip service should be
paid to the function of I.C. as a
teaching institution. The possible
controlled distribution of dupli-
cated diagrams, table, proofs, etc.
to enable the lecturers to concen-
trate on teaching an understanct-
ing of his subject and opportuni-
ties made available to lecturers
for refresher coupes on teaching
techniques apd to keep up to date
on scientific discoveries.
U N D E R G R A D U A T E
GRANTS
The reports showed that the
general opinion was that
1. The full grant is adequate
for term-time living but paid
work must be undertaken during
the vacations. All local authori-
ties should pay expenses for com-
pulsory field courses.
2. The differential between
halls and lodgings is anomalous,
the latter being very expensive in
South Kensington. There seems
no reason why the Oxbridge
allowance, where the terms are
shorter and living is cheaper,
should be higher than that in
London.
3. The Means Test should be
abolished.
4. There is a definite feeling
that National Insurance contri-
butions should not be required
from students.
POSTGRADUATE GRANTS
Some very good, detailed docu-
ments were received from the
P.G. reps and one from Chemis-
try, in particular, helped enor-
mously in the compilation of a
representative report.
The recommendations were on
the general basis that while one
does not expect nor wish to be
paid as one's contemporaries in
industry, the present DSIR grant
is insufficient. The detailed re-
commendations were that:â€”
1. Postgraduate grants should.be
adjusted to give a standard of
living higher than that of the
undergraduate.
2. Outside earning should be
subject to no restriction.
3. A realistic difference in grants
should be made according to
whether the individual is liv-
ing in hall, in lodgings or at
home.
4. A London allowance should
be paid.
5. The age-limits for a depen-
dant's allowance should be
abolished and students should
be brought into the National
Insurance scheme.
6. A yearly increment should be
paid as the postgraduate pro-
gresses from being trained; to
performing original research.
7. College demonstrating fees
should "be raised to a level
commensurate with outside
rates.
8. Grants should be reviewed
annually.
H A L L S OF RESIDENCE
Living in a Hall gives a student
greater opportunity for those per-
sonal contacts vital for scientists,
and technologists whose work is
mainlv with machines and figures.
With the Colleges situated in an
area where students may be
forced to live ten miles from
their work, there is an onus on
participation in extracurricular
activities. Every student must,
therefore, be enabled to snend at
least one year in hall. The pre-
sent resident population is about
20 per cent.; double the present
number (i.e. 1,200) will be neces-
sary to approach minimum re-
quirements as the college num-
bers rise to 4,700.
Touchstone Weekend by Chris Cooper
SILWOOD DISARMS
Unilateralism is still a strong sentiment among our generation
if those who attended the latest Touchstone Weekend were at all
tpylcal. More than 30 people spent the weekend at Silwood Park
toTiear Sir Michael Wright, British delegate at the Geneva Disarma-
meat Conferences, speak on his experience, and then put forward their
own untried views.
Sir Michael denied that vested interests in the " defence " indus-
tries have impeded progress at Geneva; the nations' fears for their
6wn safety have been more than sufficient. The Russians fear internal
inspection, the sine qua non of any disarmament agreement, and they
want a troika system for command of the necessary peace-keepig
force: i.e., a veto for the Great Powers. In the end, at least, that
sanction must vanish.
The real problem is what the peace-keeping force will be used
for; will it be able to intervene in civil or revolutionary strife in the
disarmed nations ?
Unilateralism by Britain was widely approved, especially by Our
non-British contingent; but the idea that it would provide "moral
leadership" in stopping the
spread of nuclear weapons was
dismissed as if it had never been
seriously held. Nobody argued,
either, with Sir Michael's conten-
tion that the money saved would
probably go towards an increased
conventional contribution to
N A T O (meaning, possibly, con-
scription for you and ~,
e). but it
was felt that we would be freer
of North American influence in
foreign policy.
Nobody should spend -three
years at this college without going
at least once to a Touc'istone
Weekend 7 Windsor Park is beau-
tiful in any weather, the conver-
sation is intellectual, and it's a
treat to hear the rich tones of Mr.
McDowall's peace-keeping voice
keeping the temperature down in
debate.
,The next Touchstone Weekend
will be ttth-Uth, March, when
Mr. Patrick Keattey, Common-
wealth Correspondent to the
Guardian, will introduce the topic
" Commonwealth Realities."
SOCIAL FACILUTIES
The new open-plan lounges
are difficult to use for anything
other than reading newspapers
and relaxing after meals because
of their inevitable function as
corridor. Demand is high for
smaller rooms for informal meet-
ings of clubs and societies. The
situation should improve when
new refectories are opened in
College Block, releasing present
temporary refectory space for
general Union use.
Recreational and sporting facili-
ties are considered on page 10.
