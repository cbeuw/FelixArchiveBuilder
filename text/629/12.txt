Stephen King hams it up as Jordy Verrill.
Despite its faults, George Romero's Creep-
show (AA, A B C Fulham Road, Shaftesbury
Avenue, Classic Haymarket) may prove to be
the surprise hit of the year. With a screenplay
by top horror author Stephen King (Carrie,
The Shining, etc) and the director of Night of
the Living Dead, it boasts an i m p r e s s i v e
pedigree and turns out to be an outrageous
blend of horror and comedy.
S t r u c t u r e d as a series of c o m i c b o o k
episodes, Creepshow is a fond tribute to the
marvellously over-the-top stories produced by
E C C o m i c s . W h e n a y o u n g b o y ' s father
throws his new Creepshow Comic away, a
spectral host appears to guide us through five
episodes, each introduced by the turning of a
new page. A s the drawings melt into live action
the comic book style is maintained by the use
of vivid colours and exaggerated motions.
The stories are p o p u l a t e d b y a set of
unusual, larger than life characters; in Father's
Day dotty old Aunt Bedelia returns to the
grave of her murdered father (as she does
every year on that date). But he has ideas for a
celebration of his own...This is followed by The
Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill in which
author King plays a wonderfully overdone
b u m k i n w h o f i n d s a m e t e o r i t e i n his
garden—but is it the solution to all his financial
troubles?
M y favourite piece, for the audacious title
a b o v e a l l , was The Crate s t a r r i n g H a l
Holbrook as a timid husband contemplating
the m u r d e r of his l o u d wife ( p l a y e d b y
Adrienne Barbeau with suitable abandon).
W h e n a nosy janitor finds an old abandoned
crate in the local university, he unwittingly
unlocks a creature with awesome teeth and an
unusually strong desire to return to his former
solitude. Put them together and the mayhem
has to start soon!

Well, it's back to the fifties again this week for
another look at the American youth culture of
the t i m e . D i r e c t o r B a r r y L e v i n s o n has
discovered a new hang out for his 'in' crowd: at
the local all night Diner, which is now playing
at the Empire Leicester Square and the A B C
Fulham Road.
The central characters are five men in their
early twenties who have lost all desire to grow
up, and are content to live out their lives
spending their time at the D i n e r , where
attractions include eating what look like
Mooney chips in gravy or watching a man built
along the lines of a supertanker, eating his way
through half of the menu, to the accompani-
ment of piped music of the Johnny Mathis/
Frank Sinatra variety.
Excitement indeed, only matched by the
scintillating conversation, mainly concerned
with girls and music. The talk about music
reveals that even in 1959, the crooners still
held the interest of this age group, and it was
considered rather rakish to prefer rock-n-roll.
In a world still to hear the word feminism,
girls have one object: tame their man tie him to
the home. The knack is to enjoy playing with
your matches, but not to get burned. The guys
talk about their mixed up feelings towards the
fair sex, in a way they only feel they can with
the lads down at the diner, as they try to
reconcile the easy undemanding friendship of
their peers to the complex world of love and
sex.

The last two stories are Something To Tide
You Over and the exceedingly creepy They're
Creeping Up On You, which may turn you into
a t r e m b l i n g heap n e x t t i m e y o u s e e a
cockroach.
Overall the film is entertaining and at times
very funny indeed. Despite claims that you will
leave the cinema terrified, it is not this element
which stands out. There is little time to build
a n y o f the s t o r i e s i n t o a n y t h i n g t r u l y
frightening (as with many other episodic films),
and you come to expect the shocks, knowing
each piece can only last so long. Romero
seems to have accounted for this quite well,
but his timing was noticeably off here and
there.
Horror aside, the comic book and comedy
elements are left to shine alone—and they do.
'Diner' Mooney's with piped music!
This rather downbeat film is enlivened by
the active script of M r Levinson who draws his
characters with insight and great affection.
The diner is their retreat from the real world
with its beckoning responsibilities of careers
and families. For people who don't have an
institution like university to insulate them and
postpone the growing up process, the Diner is
a good substitute.
It is a visually appealing film with huge old
American cars trundling about mingled with
garish neon and washed out shots of desolate
industrialised landscapes at d a w n as our
h e r o e s f i n i s h a n o t h e r n i g h t of m u t u a l
examination and make their way home.

The use of comic book frames is effective, but
the marvellously hammed up characters and
u n u s u a l l i g h t i n g alone c r e a t e a hugely
enjoyable 'comic book feel' which any fan will
appreciate. This makes for a very funny film,
which just about manages to tread the fine line
between homage and satire successfully.
O n reflection some of the Corman 'Poe'
films, which must have been an influence on
Romero, may be more satisfying (will B B C 2
include The Raven in their B o r i s Karloff
season I plead?), but Creepshou; comes as a
welcome break from the truly horrific spate
of 'slash the screaming teenager' movies of
recent years. It deserves to do very well and
can be thoroughly recommended under the
category 'good clean fun'.

Rather more uptempo, just opened at the
Plaza is Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, written
and directed by Carl Reiner, who, in true
Hitchcock style, also makes a brief personal
a p p e a r a n c e . T h i s film is a tribute to the
thrillers of the 40s and 50s. If Diner was big on
character but short on action, this film sets off
at a gallop from the very start, and by the end
of the first reel we are inextricably entangled in
this spoof film noir plot and waist deep in red
herrings, as the action comes as fast as the
wisecracks.
Our latter day Marlowe, Rigby Reardon, is
trying to emulate his hero. A suspicious death,
a hit list and bodies falling thick and fast, but
our hero struggles o n with just a few bullet
wounds and a cut lip; underneath it all, of
c o u r s e , i s a m a d m a n i n t e n t o n w o r l d
domination. More Fleming than Marlowe?
W e l l therin lies the rub. This is updated
Marlowe where greater things are at stake
than the ruin of the odd smalltime gangster.
Our hero also commits the heinous crime of
falling for his (female) client, squeezing
toothpaste over her shoes and talking about
pyjamas. This temporal warp is emphasised by
using clips from the original films, cut in, some
times cleverly out of context, to the new
material. This is done by various means. The
standard method of the time for filming a
dramatic scene with a close-up of the star's
face filmed over the shoulder of the co-star
who is out of focus is exploited, replacing one
of the protagonists to produce curious results,
including Rigby serenading Gary Grant with
his harmonica and the hopping into Grant's
