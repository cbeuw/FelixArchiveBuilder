A Degree of
Ignorance
Horoscopes, U F O s and ghosts
were among the fallacies attacked
by D r M a g n u s Pyke under the
heading ' A Budget of Fallacies'
last M o n d a y . D r Pyke has spent
the last ten years trying to tell his
fellow citizens what science is all
a b o u t . H e is s t i l l t r y i n g a n d
spent some time extolling the
virtues of hard science and the
scientific method: " I have been
very much disturbed and upset
by the d e g r e e o f i g n o r a n c e
generally prevalent about the
world we live i n . " People have
no understanding of the science
that affects their lives, he says.
" O u t s i d e these w a l l s , " D r Pyke
cried, one of his famous a r m -
waves encompassing the entire
College, "they are savages!" H e
p r a i s e d the a c h i e v e m e n t s o f
science in general and with a
particular bias towards chemis-
try a n d b i o l o g y s p e a k i n g of
miracles from rational means,
slipping in numerous jokes at the
expense of the engineers and
mathematicians. H e then turned
to the f a l l a c i e s a n d p s e u d o -
science "the poison of unreason"
that still persists: 30 to 40 million
A m e r i c a n s believe deeply i n
a s t r o l o g y . D r P y k e then r a n
through all the popular fallacies,
referring to spoon bending, the
Bermuda Triangle, dowsing and
homeopathy with a final w a r n -
ing note on witchburning and
nazism; the master race fallacy.
D r Pyke appealed to all science
s t u d e n t s to h e l p d i s p e l the
fallacies because o f the r e a l
danger of the ignorance they
indicate.

Morphy
Muck-Up
The Morphy Oar was broken on
Wednesday during the annual
towpath battle. City and Guilds
now possess one third of the
trophy and Mines hold the rest.
The M o r p h y D a y battle itself
did not start until dusk, with
v a r i o u s r e v o l t i n g substances
b e i n g h u r l e d at e v e r y o n e i n
sight. This year's predominant
ingredient was fish gut, but after
the R C S U fire engine Jez had
hosed down the towpath there
was more left on the participants
than on the ground. C o m p a r a -
tively few people were allowed
into Harrods for tea afterwards.
In the more serious rowing
competition, City and G u i l d s
won the M o r p h y and L o w r y
eights, and a team from R C S U
won the ladies' race.
who was busy at the N a t i o n a l
Conference. Since M r H o w a r d

preceded by an informal debate
b e t w e e n P h i l i p N a t h a n ( I C
L i b e r a l s ) a n d P a u l S i m i o n
( P W P ) on the N U S issue.
IC 'Armless'
I C is cutting off its own arms,
according to Frank H o w a r d ,
N U S Exec M e m b e r , when ques-
tioned about I C U ' s re-affiliation
to N U S . M r H o w a r d said that
N U S would be even stronger and
able to negotiate better deals for
students by having I C U among
its m e m b e r s . T h i s w o u l d be
especially true for issues such as
the rationalisation of L o n d o n
U n i v e r s i t y a n d the v a r i o u s
mergers involved.
M r H o w a r d was addressing a
meeting on Tuesday replacing
N U S Vice-President Jane T a y l o r
Frank Howard
M r H o w a r d challenged M r
Simion's claim that N U S works
on "totally unrealistic grounds"
and said that, although N U S is
radical, not all its members are
stereotyped activists. H e also
denied that N U S ' s bureaucracy
is larger than needed or that its
ways are undemocratic and said
t h a t , a l t h o u g h it h a s m a d e
mistakes in the past, it is the sole
organisation to represent our
interests.
FELIXI
Racial
Discrimination
S t u d e n t S e r v i c e s ' d e c i s i o n to
practise positive discrimination
when allocating places in H a l l to
p o s t g r a d u a t e s next year has
caused concern a m o n g people
who feel there will be no room
for British P G s in H a l l . The
Student Services Officer M i c h a e l
H H M M V ' H H l November 26, 1982
A r t h u r explained the situation to
F E L I X :
The first group on the ladder
o f p r i o r i t i e s w i l l be overseas
postgraduate freshers, w h o will
all have one guaranteed year in a
s i n g l e r o o m i n a n I m p e r i a l
College or Intercollegiate H a l l .
The next priority will be given to
first y e a r p o s t g r a d u a t e s w h o
have not studied at I C before.
M S c s t u d e n t s w i l l be g i v e n
priority over P h D students and
female students will have priority
over male.
T h e j u s t i f i c a t i o n f o r these
decisions is that firstly overseas
students have to pay full tuition
fees a n d so t h e y s h o u l d be
allowed the financial relief of
living in H a l l , which is usually
c h e a p e r t h a n l i v i n g o u t s i d e .
Students who pay full fees are
much sought after by the College
and are likely to be influenced by
the a v a i l a b i l i t y o f a c c o m m o -
dation. A l s o , students who have
never l i v e d i n B r i t a i n b e f o r e
have a great need of guaranteed
housing. Secondly M S c students
have an intensive, timetabled
one-year course a n d have little
opportunity to look for housing
while P h D students have a more
flexible course and can take time
off. F i n a l l y , female students
might be worried about living on
t h e i r o w n i n L o n d o n , a n d
because there are so few women
s t u d e n t s the C o l l e g e tries to
encourage female applicants.
M i c h a e l A r t h u r p u t these
proposals to a recent meeting of
the Student Residence C o m m i t -
tee, and they were approved in
p r i n c i p l e . T h e s c h e m e w i l l
probably be implemented for
next year's admissions.
Bar Accounts
Open
B o b Schroter, C h a i r m a n of the
R e f e c t o r i e s C o m m i t t e e , has
offered to open the Ba r accounts
to the members of the Ba r Sub-
committee only. H i s proposal
was r e v e a l e d to C o u n c i l o n
M o n d a y evening. The scheme
was agreed to a n d has been
referred to the next U G M for
a p p r o v a l . B u t D r S c h r o t e r
d i s m i s s e d as ' r i d i c u l o u s ' r u -
mours that the Rector himself
had ordered him to do this.
Sexism
Protest
A lone Imperial College student
was the only protester outside
the Albert H a l l last Thursday
e v e n i n g . M i c h a e l N e w m a n
a p p e a r e d w i t h h i s b a n n e r ,
reading ' D o w n with the Stereo-
type F e m a l e / M a l e ' , just as the
rich connoisseurs of the Miss
W o r l d competition were leaving.
Some interest was shown in his
banner, but the main comments
were advising him not to get too
cold.
After a small protest march
in front of the Albert H a l l M r
N e w m a n sat down opposite the
hall and was joined by a friendly
p o l i c e m a n . T h e t w o c h a t t e d
amicably, both of them explain-
ing to enquirers the meaning of
the slogan.
There was an unusually large
police contingent for the compe-
tition this year as a group of
F a l k l a n d s ' H e r o e s h a d been
i n v i t e d . D u e to h i g h m e d i a
attention it was feared that they
might be a target for terrorists.
