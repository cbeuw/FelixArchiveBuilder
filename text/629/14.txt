The S T O I C dictator, Martin Z Galtieri, has
decided that this week's c o l u m n shall be
devoted to convincing students that S T O I C is
somewhat different to a banana republic.
a) Frontiers: Any member of the IC Union
can cross the border into the studios, bringing
as much booze as they like, they'll probably
need it. Citizenship is achieved by application
to the local royalty.
b) Government: Something like the psuedo-
democracy practised in Britain except that in
S T O I C , if enough people want to produce
something the ruling junta has to give in (ie not
take the equipment home to play with). The
enthusiasm of this year's first year c o u l d
account for the late appearance of Electric
Blue 008.
c) Freedom: T o our knowledge no S T O I C
member has ever disappeared under strange
circumstances, no mass graves have been
discovered, yet.
d) Quality of Life: There's food for all,
reasonable, if unpredictable, hours, plenty of
sleep, nice weather (usually very hot unless
you're on an O B crew). Come and join us here
in the vaults of opportunity, maybe you can
figure out what we're showing next Tuesday—
it's certainly a challenge.
In short, our Hon Sec says he's never had it
(so good).

After the rather disappointing response to the
last question the President (grovel) has
decided that something slightly less taxing
should be asked of you lot, so that, being
students, you'll get the answer and, perhaps
win the prize (there really is one, too). Now,
lugs pinned?
"What is the connection between Malcolm
M c D o w e l l , Imperial College a n d Science
Fiction?"
Very simple, indeed (even Sue's pet Herpes
simplex virus could do that one). So, answers
to Neil Martin, Life Sci letter-racks by next
Thursday lunchtime, please, and, who knows,
you too might be the proud owner of the
fabulous S F Soc Prize. I mean, look what it did
for the President (grovel).

Bar Games night last Friday was a great
success with about forty people in attendance.
Everybody seemed to enjoy buying Mayfair
(not the magazine, silly!) or winning rubbers
etc though the Kentucky did not go down so
well.
Silly Sports outside Harrods on Saturday
was also a great success. Congratulations
go to M i k e S t u a r t of M e c h E n g 2 who~
collected £188—the highest a m o u n t ever
collected in one day by one person. Despite
hopscotching being given the thumbs down by
a p o l i c e m a n , m u c h f u n w a s h a d w i t h
s a c k / w h e e l b a r r o w / n - l e g g e d races, h u m a n
pyramids, egg catching, etc.
Now to forthcoming events: Today sees the
2nd 135 club trip of the year—meet union bar
at 6:30pm. The 135 club involves merry jaunts
to Y o u n g s tied h o u s e s to s a m p l e their
excellent beer. It is a great night out and if you

We have a good selection of Christmas
cards and wrapping paper, some really good
b o o k s that will m a k e g o o d p r e s e n t s .
Stationery items, the new design enamel pill
boxes with either the College Crest on, or a
general view of the College £21.50. If there are
any books you want, we can always get them.
We are a general bookshop, not just academic.
So long as a book is in print, we can get it.
A t t h e r e c e n t F e l l o w s D i n n e r , y o u r
illustrious President was somewhat taken
aback when I introduced him to my wife. Even
Bookshop Managers have wives! I hope he
enjoyed the book!

Hammersmith pub crawl! Meet Union Bar

those with cast iron stomachs (ie not me!).
After the success of the last pub crawl which
20 people attended, we expect at least forty
people on Saturday. O n Friday December 3
there is a Guilds Motor Club Rally. See the
Motor Club noticeboard outside the Guilds
Office for details.
Have a good week.

Tomorrow there is the annual rugby match
against the R S M A (old boys). It is always an
exciting match played in an air of fun, so if you
feel like watching an entertaining match and
giving a bit of support, come along as there are
a few places on the coach left. The coach will
leave Prince Consort Road at about 1:00pm.
D o n ' t forget that there is a U G M o n
Tuesday November 30 (next Tuesday!) at
12:45 in G20. We will have slides of the Ice
Skating a n d also hopefully the F r e s h e r s
Barnite.
Again, a date to remember! The Mines Ball
on Friday December 17. Definitely the event of
the year and open to everyone in College.
Come along to the R S M Union Office and get
your name down (and bring a cheque!). We
will accept postdated cheques till next term.
Please don't leave it till just before the day to
book your ticket (as it kind of messes us
around!) come in now and do it.
Anyway hope all is going well and work isn't
too tiresome.

If a close relative of yours was suffering from
great pain and in the last stages of a terminal
illness, would you be justified in agreeing to kill
your relative if he or she asked you to? This is
a very difficult question that few of us would be
willing to answer without a lot of thought. If
you've ever wondered how you would react
then please come to our next meeting (6:00pm
N o v e m b e r 30, G r e e n C o m m i t t e e R o o m )
where a speaker from Exit will be talking about
Euthanasia.
If you're curious about what we d o in
Socialist Society, then you'll be welcome to
turn up- a bit earlier (5:30pm or thereabouts)
when there will be a General Meeting. O r
come along to the Bookstall in the J C R any
Friday lunchtime. In any case, good luck and
death to capitalism!
Graffitti
The brave graffitti committee prepared for an
onslaught on students. A n ad was placed in
F E L I X , d e s p i t e n u m e r o u s p r o b l e m s a
newsletter was p r o d u c e d (and left in the
c h a i r m a n ' s f l a t ) . T h e n e w s l e t t e r w a s
distributed with perfect timing (ie at the last
minute) and all was ready for the demon-
stration on November 10.
What happened? Half the committee went
off to the National Graphics Exhibition while
the poor Chairman was dragged off to show
interviewees around College. In atonement for
his sins he was made to cycle to Fulham with
two screens and get lost searching for Serical
rescreening department.
All is not lost. The mega demonstration of
printing and airbrushing is to happen next
Wednesday and I will be there this time! If you
are interested please come up to the workshop
at 1:00pm.
Film Soc
H i , there film fans! O K so the last two
programmes were the pits but this time it'll be
different: for one thing the films are not from
London Film Coop. This week it's the Marx
Brothers (no, not Karl and Hemi, the genuine
article) in The B i g Store a n d The Marx
Brothers Co West (50p to non-members; free
to members) both in one big, big programme
at 8:30pm, Friday ME220.
Incidentally, the reason I was not present at
the showing of Rat Life and Diet/Sad Movies
was not because I had already seen them and
was afraid I'd get lynched when they were
shown. However, as it transpired, I was indeed
wise ot keep away from the righteous wrath of
the paying (?) public.
See you there.
