Q Sailing
F o r probably the first time in
living memory, the entire I C
team arrived early at Water-
l o o — u n d o u b t e d l y a t e a m i n
winning form (?). O n arrival at
F a r n h a m station, however, the
promised lift didn't material-
ise—Surrey University's idea of
team transport turned out to be
G r a h a m ' s bike!
H a v i n g finally got onto th
water, I C made a traditional
start to the first r a c e — H o w a r t h
got entangled with the starter's
launch whilst Kennedy executed
a copybook, but slightly pre-
mature, victory roll. N o t to be
outdone, H o w a r t h stopped at
the windward mark to wait for
the other boats, and used the
opportunity to tie his old wreck
together again. This gave Surrey
the race with Ist, 2nd and 3rd
positions.
The second race was a rather
better display of sailing and,
d e s p i t e B e v a n ' s m u t t e r i n g
s o m e t h i n g a b o u t h i s r u d d e r
d r o p p i n g off, I C w o n c o n -
vincingly. Surrey were evidently
alarmed at this threat to their
macho image, and refused to sail
the third and final r a c e — I C thus
won the match 2-1 by default.
Thanks to Pat (that's not very
good, is it) M i l l s for demon-
strating his Hooter!
Team: Bennett, Bevan, Dalton,
Howarth, Kennedy, Tostevin.
Three members of the sailing
C l u b : J a m e s B a x t e r , D a v i d
Chadwick and Graeme Castle
made up half of the U L team
which sailed at L i v e r p o o l and
Manchester last weekend. Jus-
t i f y i n g t h e i r p o s i t i o n as the
British Universities champions
the team beat Liverpool and
Manchester Universities easily,
the other v i s i t i n g t e a m f r o m

Rifle & Pistol
The C l u b outing to Bisley on
S u n d a y w a s a t r e m e n d o u s
success. Panic set in at an early
stage when Steve H a r r i s o n (Club
Captain, contact via Elec E n g
letter-racks) succeeded in losing
at least half the squad. M e a n -
while the remainder were being
FELIX H H H H H H H k H
reassured by G o r d o n that the
weather was certain to get worse
(prophesy correct).
E v e n t u a l l y w h e n a l l w e r e
present, the morning's shooting
commenced at 300 yards. The
late feature was J o n a t h o n , his
alarm clock having baffled his
enormous brain. Steve's costume
was commented on by everybody
at B i s l e y , the N S R A b e i n g
b e s i e g e d by b l i n d e d m a r k s -
persons (!) requiring sunglasses.
H i g h scores were recorded by
A n d r e w H a m i l t o n (47), Neill
W o o d (45), T Higgs (45), M a r k
Bourke (43), Pauline Pike (43).
A wet lunch was followed by a
very wet afternoon and con-
ditions of near invisibility over
the 600 y a r d r a n g e . P a u l i n e ,
Caroline and Julia modelled a
sensational new line in contour-
hugging wet jeans. However the

H i g g s u s u a l a r d o u r . H i g h
scorers in the afternoon were
Simon A l l p o r t and A n d r e w (yet
again).
Last Wednesday saw a heroic
triumph by I C over St M a r y s
Dental H o s p i t a l and L o n d o n
Medical H o s p i t a l . St M a r y s were
completely outclassed while I C
and L o n d o n had a very close
match. Results: I C 577, L H M C
572, St M a r y s 523, T Higgs 89.
Fine performances were given by
Noel, Seamus and Neill.
Quote of the week by Neill
W o o d : " J a n e makes me shave
twice a day otherwise it hurts her
legs."
Boat

day. They won eight out of the

rowed Senior C eights final.
Highlight of the day was the

showed their class beating St
Thomas' Hospital by two and a
h a l f l e n g t h s . O t h e r t o p class
performances were turned in by
the open coxed four who w o n by

Cross Country
The I C runners arrived at Bath
University in plenty of time to
allow enough recovery after the
hike up the hill from the station.
Once again we made up the
majority of the L o n d o n U n i v e r -
sity team—the remainder arrived
just before the start after a visit
to one of the local hostelries.
It wasn't surprising then that
four of the six scoring runners
came from I C . A n d y Griffiths
was first man in in thirty-seventh
place w i t h T a s s o A s t e r i a d e s
r u n n i n g v e r y w e l l to f i n i s h
thirty-ninth, having just resumed
training after a neck injury.
The following also completed
the five m i l e course w i t h o u t
falling in the quarry and helped
L o n d o n U n i v e r s i t y r e t a i n its
f i f t h p o s i t i o n o v e r a l l i n the
league: R o b M o r r i s o n , N i c k
F e n w i c k , G r a h a m H a r k e r ,
H u g h D i x o n , Steven T a y l o r and
J o n Frost (Capt).
Basketball
IC vs St Marys 52-66
H a v i n g been beaten the previous
night by Baro R o a d , we were
faced with another tough fixture
against St M a r y s , last y e a r ' s
league winners. O n l y six players
made the trip to T w i c k e n h a m
(all in A n d y ' s F o r d Escort), and
if it wasn't for Ken' s incredible
I November 26, 1982
navigating we wouldn't have got
there at a l l !
The match was played with a
distinct lack of substitutes and i n
front of a corwd of about forty
'hostile' people. Brian's (casual)
'3 point plays', Ken' s (even more
c a s u a l ) h o o k s h o t s a n d a n
inspired team performance gave
us a well deserved half-time lead.
Six minutes into the second
half the strain started to show in
our team. L a c k of concentration,
brought on by tired legs, gave St
M a r y s the chance to develop a
ten point lead.
A morale raising team talk
managed to stop the rot from
setting i n , but, try as we might,
we couldn't reduce the lead. The
refereeing didn't help our cause
but in the end a very satisfying
result.
T e a m : Brian, Tim, Kastio,
Tammann, Andy and Ken.
Cycling
A n d so five were chosen by fate
to commence gladatorial battle
w i t h the d e m i - g o d d i s t a n c e ,
aided in his evil ways by the
elemental w i n d .
O n trusty steeds of iron and
Reynolds 531 they set out from
their h o m e , s t e a d i l y b e a t i n g
distance into the ground. D i s -
tance in his turn threw hills and
d e t o u r s at t h e m , a n d w i n d
fought ceaselessly.
T h e f i v e p a s s e d a c a s t l e
(closed for winter) and a R o m a n
villa (closed for lunch) finding
no aid. Eventually time out was
called at a hostelry in the barren
outland near Shoreham.
T h e s e c o n d r o u n d p r o v e d
easier, with distance on the run.
W i n d , sensing the turn in events,
opted to aid the gallant five as
they returned, triumphant to the
crystal city.
The rules state: " W i n n e r s stay
o n " , so this week battle will be
r e s u m e d as o t h e r w h e e l e d
stallions depart. The faces may
change but the fight goes on.
