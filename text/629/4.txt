Sir
M a y I, through the pages of
F E L I X , protest at the offensive-
ness of this year's R a g M a g , a
copy of which I was unfortunate
enough to recently acquire. The
majority of the so-called 'jokes'
I found, as a Christian, both
vulgar and re'pulsive—especially
those concerned with racism. I
feel that it is a sad reflection on
the state of our society when
some people can consider the
sort of material contained within
t h e R a g M a g a s f u n n y —
thankfully, some of us still find
this sort o f ' h u m o u r ' t o t a l l y
o b n o x i o u s . H a v i n g s a m p l e d
some of the 'student h u m o u r at
its irreverent best', I read the
editorial which added insult to
injury, and made sure in my
mind that I should voice m y
disgust. Just because some of us
have morals and ethics somewhat
different to those of M r C r a w -
f o r d , does not give h i m justi-
fication to refer to us as 'narrow-
minded' and 'shit filled', and it
does not follow that we lead
'humourless, crapped-up lives'.
I would also like to point out
that the R a g M a g is one of our
contacts with outside world, and
is t h u s t a k e n b y o t h e r s as
r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of the C o l l e g e
(even though it is not a fair
r e p r e s e n t a t i o n o f the w h o l e
College). I, for one, am quite
a s h a m e d that the C o l l e g e o f
which I am a member produces
a n d s e l l s s u c h a d i s g r a c e f u l
p u b l i c a t i o n — e s p e c i a l l y under
such a misleading title. (I have
heard of an instance where a
mother bought a copy for her
y o u n g c h i l d b e c a u s e o f the
'Janet and J o h n ' title.)
Finally, I would like to ask
whether or not the fact that
s o m e t h i n g m a k e s m o n e y f o r
c h a r i t y m e a n s that the t h i n g
itself is necessarily right?
I hope very much that you
print this letter, and I hope that

News Bias—
Round 3
Dear Sir
I a m s o r r y i f I u p s e t y o u r
reporter, A d r i a n James, with my
letter the other week; from the
tone of his reply, he seems rather
distressed! (If he w o u l d care to
read my original letter, he might
then be able to answer my actual
c r i t i c i s m , r a t h e r t h a n a s c r i b e
v i e w s to me t h a t I d o n o t
p o s s e s s . S ' f u n n y h o w m a n y
people assume that those who
ask for fair and unmisleading
reporting actually want biased
reporting—I assume this to be a
symptom of their closed minds.
But I digress.)
A d r i a n James' letter was, like
h i s o r i g i n a l ' n e w s ' a r t i c l e
p e r h a p s , n o t e n t i r e l y u n m i s -
leading, so perhaps I may be
permitted to 'worry' the w o r d
'betray' a little further.
Surely M r James does not
n e e d me t o p o i n t o u t t h a t
although one of the ten usages of
the w o r d 'betray' given by his
dictionary is indeed "to indicate
or show signs o f , the other
more c o m m o n usages all suggest
e i t h e r i n a d v e r t e n c e o r s o m e
dishonourable motive. W h e n the
w o r d is used in the sense he
i n t e n d e d , the effect c a n be
a m b i g u o u s , as n o t e d i n E r i c
Partridge's excellent Usage and
Abusage. 'Betray' is, I w o u l d
suggest, more usually applied in
the sense intended to inanimate
objects, where there is less scope
f o r a m b i g u i t y ! ( I n c i d e n t a l l y ,
Webster also notes its use for " t o
show or indicate"—but adds,
"(as something not obvious on
the surface)". G i v e or take the
odd pinstripe suit, I have always
f o u n d S i r A s h l e y ' s s o c i a l i s t
principles highly visible!)
Finally, I won't make a cheap
r e f e r e n c e to t h e i n e v i t a b l e
printing errors that crept into M r
James' letter, but on the subject
of spelling, might I request that
the next time someone chooses,
h o w e v e r c h i l d i s h l y , to s p e l l
' D a i l y T o r y g r a p h ' and not to
'correct' it as with my previous
letter. (Mutters cry of 'Censor-
ship' (!), and exits triumphantly
(?)•)
Yours pedantically, and in haste,

Parking Permits
Dear Sir
M a n y happy tube journeys
ago after wantonly applying for
a parking permit, my wife and I
( b o t h p h y s i c s p o s t g r a d u a t e s )
were told we d i d not qualify
because we only lived six miles
out i n Islington and most people
who were allocated permits lived
at least twelve miles out and a lot
of P G s travelled in from O x f o r d .
I must admit we left the U n i o n
O f f i c e t h i n k i n g " C a d s
B o u n d e r s ! It c a n ' t be t r u e ! "
N o w however I see the errors of
m y w a y s . W h i l e w a n d e r i n g
casually around the estate on
which we live I came across two
c a r s w i t h v a l i d I C p a r k i n g
permits. " R o t t e r s ! " I thought,
but then I realised of course that
t h e y m u s t h a v e b e e n d o w n
visiting someone from O x f o r d
because we happened to have
overslept this particular day and
it was about 10:30am, and as we
a l l k n o w a n y b o d y w h o gets
parking permits w o u l d of course
use them every day unlike two
h a r d w o r k i n g P G s w h o never
work late or anything like that.

PS: Today I came across a third
car and I realise now we should
take up praying to M e c c a as in
certain other permit applications

before.
We w o u l d be obliged if this is
not edited too drastically and
published in full if possible.

Mines Coffee
Dear Martin
I n r e s p o n s e to M A G n u s
whinings last week I should like
to bring to his attention the
fabulous beverage service avail-
able on the first floor of the
Mines Building. F o r a mere lOp
you can enjoy the peace and
quiet of a coffee-room full of
M i n e s m e n ( a n d w o m e n ) , the
s p e c t a c l e o f l i f e a n d d e a t h
struggles with G o r f i a n Empires,
asteroid belts and Pacmen, or
the a n g u i s h as yet a n o t h e r
student finds that the infamous
coffee machine has swallowed
his only lOp. T h r o w n in free
with all this sundry entertain-
m e n t is the d r i n k i t s e l f , a n
irresistable chocolate or coffee
brew carefully cultivated in the
dungeons of the Gerrards Cross
M a x p a x factory. This assumes of
course that you are not one of
the u n l u c k y a f o r e m e n t i o n e d
persons whose loss is R S M U s
gain. In fact this year I expect
r e c o r d p r o f i t s s i n c e , l i k e a
n u m b e r o f l e c t u r e r s at I C ,
p e r f o r m a n c e h a s r e a c h e d a
pinnacle of unreliability as the
years have taken their toll.
So make a move, Space Cadet
G n u s and get yourself over to
R S M . I'm afraid we can't offer
you T y P h o o Tea, which is what I
thought G n u s drank, but our
machine sure gives a mean cup
of coffee (only lOp remember),
and if you're lucky I'll give you a
refill from the vegetable sludge
in the spillage tray.
I think I'd better get on with
some R o c k Mechanics now.

Lexham Gardens
Dear Martin
W e live i n a H e a d Tenancy
flat in L e x h a m Gardens. W h e n
we moved in the flat was in a
disgusting state including (as we
found out to our cost) fleas in
the carpets. A l s o the rent was
put up by 2 2 % to £22.50pw.
In v i e w o f M r G o u l d e r ' s
election pledge, (yet another one
b r o k e n ) , to i m p r o v e H e a d
T e n a n c y a c c o m m o d a t i o n we
wrote to both h i m and Students
Services. M r Goulder's reply was
totally unconcerned, he didn't
answer our questions and he
passed the buck on to Students
Services who have since done
nothing.
One member of our flat has
since confronted M r G o u l d e r
with these problems and was
told, " I do not have time for
individuals."
It seems that M r G o u l d e r feels
himself to be above the problems
of the ordinary student.

J Soc Opinions
Dear Martin
I as taken aback by the light
hearted, carefree attitude shown
in the J Soc article regarding the
'killing of innocent people in
L e b a n o n . . . ' . T h e a r t i c l e was
indicating ' O K the number of
'civilians' killed didn't reach 6 m ,
so it can't be described as a
h o l o c a u s t . ' S u r e l y n o ' t r u e '
r e l i g i o u s f a i t h ( o f a n y k i n d
whatever) can endure such a
stupid, nitpicking attitude.
The article did get its message
across t h o u g h — r e v e a l i n g yet
again the similarities between
t h e s a d i s t i c N a z i s a n d t h e
Zionists.
T h a n k you.
