Food for Thought?
Last year the three constituent
college unions spent over £2,000
on freshers' dinners. Now £2,000
does not strike me as a large sum
when discussing union finances,
but it is worth asking if anyone
derives any benefit from this
expenditure, particularly since
last week's Guilds UGM came
very close to telling the Union's:
officers to stop freshers dinners
altogether.
Freshers' dinners give new
students the opportunity to get
to know staff and students from
their o w n d e p a r t m e n t a n d
generally to have a pleasant
evening socialising. That anyway
is the sales p a t t e r u s e d to
persuade freshers to part with
t h e i r m o n e y . H o w f a r the
dinners come up to these ideals
is the subject of this article.
Inevitably it is based on my
experience of the dinners organ-
ised by Guilds; those run by
R C S U and R S M U may not be as
bad.
by Jon Stanley
Attendances at the dinners has
fallen over recent years; an
extreme example is DOC—less
than twenty people went to this
year's freshers' dinner compared
to over 130 in my first year.
Few people are satisfied that
the meal they receive is worth
£8.50 per head charged by M r
M o o n e y . I have never heard
anyone describe the food as better
than 'tolerable*.
Very few people enjoy the
dinner enough to want to come
to another in their second or
third year. Moreover a signifi-
cant number actually feel they
have been "ripped o f f by the
Union—hardly a good way of
encouraging participation in
other union activities.
Few staff attend the dinners
Those who do often only go
because they feel it is their duty
to be there.
Finally, if freshers' dinners are
a way of meeting other students,
it is certainly not the only or
most important way (can you
even remember who sat next to
you at your freshers' dinner?)
Not going to a freshers' dinner
does not blight you for the rest
of your time at IC (I never went
to mine in my first year and it
has not done me any harm!)
The Guilds President was only
able to prevent the 'stop the
freshers' dinner' motion being
passed by promising to change
next year's dinners ( a n d b y
stopping anyone from opposing
his amendments).
Successive presidents have
promised to improve freshers'
dinners. Nothing has changed
for the better; in fact they have
got worse. Perhaps the time has
come for ICU to be a bit more
critical when considering the
C C U claims, after all there are
plenty of ICU clubs that could
usefully spend that £2,000.
