The Graduate: An Ents film
-Anne Bancroft and Dustin
Hoffman star in this film about
a graduate who is given a crash
course in the facts of life by the
notorious Mrs Robinson. All
goes well until he falls in love

An added attraction of this
film is the Simon and Garfunkel
music. This film was directed
by Mike Nichols.
