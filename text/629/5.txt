Bar Accounts
D r Schroter has at last agreed to
let the Ba r Committee see the
accounts provided they are kept
to people on that committee.
This is a long way short of what
we were asking, but at least the
accounts are available to proper
student representatives, and not
just to Stephen Goulder.

Rowsell were hasty in sending
round the heavies to deal with
those responsible; they should

EDITORIAL
Steve G o u l d e r was thought-
less in publicly accusing J o n
Barnett of theft; he should have
been more careful in wording his
letter.
But with all the aggression and
ill-feeling floating around, most
people have missed one over-
riding point, namely that every-
one who has seen Guildshit has
f o u n d it very f u n n y . A l l the
remaining copies are now in the
p o s s e s s i o n o f G u i l d s . T h e
n e w s p a p e r was p r o d u c e d by
N i c k Pyne at his own expense,
and unless G u i l d s redistribute
them at some point in the future,
they are open to exactly the same
criticism as they aimed at its
publishers.
Leukaemia Sufferer
Barrie H o l t of the H o l l a n d C l u b

leukaemia sufferer who is trying
to get into the Guinness B o o k of

individual over a given period of

Christmas FELIX
Next week there will be a normal
Friday F E L I X as usual. The
following F r i d a y , December 10,
there will be a F E L I X Careers
brochure instead of a regular
issue, and the Christmas F E L I X
w i l l a p p e a r o n the f o l l o w i n g
T u e s d a y , D e c e m b e r 14. A n y
ideas f o r features, h u m o r o u s
articles, cartoons and general
festive merriment will be grate-
fully received.
Impossible Without....

new people too. Special mention
to photographer Dave W Parry
who risked his camera to get
pictures of M o r p h y D a y , and to
Peter H o b b i s who stayed up till
the small hours printing them.
Sorry we didn't have room to
publish them!

S P E A K I N G T O a large crowd
on a semi-formal occasion is not
a t a s k w h i c h s t u d e n t s c a n
u n d e r t a k e l i g h t l y . I a m n o t
t a l k i n g a b o u t interrupting
someone else's oratory in order
to make a correction or a joke or
to ridicule the speaker; this is a
very easy a n d c h e a p w a y of
putting the speaker off, and one
w h i c h s t u d e n t s , w i t h t h e i r
c u s t o m a r y h a b i t o f f l i p p a n t
repartee, tend to overdo. But
when faced with a large crowd,
all of w h o m are listening, and
none of w h o m w i l l p r o m p t ,
heckle, offer any encouragement
at a l l , the man behind the lectern
can be the loneliest man in the
world.
Stephen Goulder, for instance,
is far more nervous on formal
o c c a s i o n s t h a n he a p p e a r s
W e l c o m i n g f r e s h e r s at t h e
Rector's Reception on the first
day of term cost him a night's
sleep worrying about how his
speech would be received. A n d
M a r y Freeman (who on that
o c c a s i o n h a d h a d r a t h e r too
much sleep and showed up half
an hour late) dried up completely
in the middle of her welcome
a n d sat d o w n m i d - s e n t e n c e
l e a v i n g b o t h herself a n d her
audience horribly embarrassed.
O t h e r s p e a k e r s t e n d to the
opposite extreme, and ramble on
incessantly while not actually
saying very much.
A l l of which brings me to the
H G Wells Society whose chair-
man proposes a vote of thanks
to the lecturer at the end of the
weekly lecture. Last year this job
was taken by Pallab G h o s h of
FEUxmwmmmsmmsm
Physics 3, who, with his usual
nervous courtesy, managed to
p e r f o r m h i s a p p o i n t e d d u t y
quite efficiently by spending the
entire lecture preparing his vote
of thanks rather than listening to
the lecturer. This arrangement
resulted in the vote of thanks
bearing little relation to the talk,
but otherwise was quite satis-
factory.
This year, however, one M i k e
M c C l a n c y has taken on the job
a n d he s e e m s to be t r y i n g
to c r a m as m a n y g a f f e s as
possible into each speech, falling
over himself in his nervousness
to use the least sensitive wording
available. W h e n will he realise, I
wonder, that saying " I ' m sure
there are lots of questions you
want to a s k , " invites disaster
when there aren't.
T o be fair, it was cruel of
Magnus Pyke to tell an anecdote
about how on a previous occa-
sion he had refused to answer
q u e s t i o n s f r o m the a u d i e n c e ,
when he had previously asked
M i k e to invite feedback. A n d
two weeks ago it was hardly
M i k e ' s fault when J o h n Pap-
w o r t h o f the F o u r t h W o r l d
S o c i e t y s t a r t e d i n s u l t i n g the
audience because they couldn't
think of any questions to ask.
But the classic in awfulness
c a m e a f t e r B B C ' s G r a h a m
M a s s e y gave a t a l k o n the
Horizon p r o g r a m m e . A f t e r -
wards, M i k e shambled out to the
front and, following the usual
cliches about an interesting and
informative talk, said that he
hoped M r Massey would be able
to come back in a few weeks
" w e l l , m a y b e m o n t h s . . . e r . . . I
mean, a few years, and that then
he'll have something worthwhile
to say." A t this pont he was
about to give way completely
when, to the total astonishment
of the gathering, the normally
introvert Pallab G h o s h vaulted
the front bench, beamed up at
the a u d i e n c e a n d , w i t h o u t
p r e a m b l e , b e g a n to t e l l a n
e x c e e d i n g l y b o r i n g j o k e . O n
reaching the punchline he sat
down again a m i d expressions of
astonishment from the disbeliev-
ing audience; the only man who
refused to be nonplussed was
M r Massey who proceeded to
pelt M r G h o s h with pieces of
chalk.
L A S T Y E A R for the Christmas
C o m p e t i t i o n , we a s k e d f o r
appropriate anagrams of people,
places, buildings or institutions
connected with I C . (One of the
prizewinners was an anagram of
I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E O F
S C I E N C E A N D T E C H N O L O -
G Y which became O N E P L A C E
O F M I N C E D L O G I C T H E Y
A L L R E C O G N I S E . ) This year,
I ' m l o o k i n g f o r a p p r o p r i a t e
acrostics of suitable targets, and
as before there's a large Christ-
mas pudding for the best.

W H A T C A N O N E say about
the new Deputy President J o h n
M c C a l l i o n ? Friendly and helpful,
if a little taciturn, he seems to be
t a k i n g his j o b w i t h w e l c o m e
seriousness and doing it calmly
and efficiently with half the fuss
that other members of the Exec
seem to need. In fact, apart from
his mysterious credit in the R C S
H a n d b o o k as J o h n 'Yellowlines'
M c C a l l i o n , he seemed a sing-
ularly fruitless source of material
for this column; that is, he d i d
until last M o n d a y ' s C o u n c i l .
S i m o n R o d a n , like his pre-
decessor as E x t e r n a l A f f a i r s
Officer, J M a r t i n T a y l o r , is a
great one for using procedural
wrangles to get his o w n way, and
during the meeting had cause to
challenge chairman N i c k Pyne's
ruling. N i c k handed the chair to
J o h n M c C a l l i o n , who plainly
had no idea what was expected
of h i m , and consequently chaired
the meeting (quite efficiently)
by pausing every few seconds and
asking N i c k Pyne what he had to
do next.
D R A M S O C ' s p r o d u c t i o n o f
Butley last week was set in an
appallingly untidy office, with
w a s t e p a p e r e v e r y w h e r e . T h e
play ran for two nights, and on
the morning between them the
cleaners got to the set and tidied
it up.
