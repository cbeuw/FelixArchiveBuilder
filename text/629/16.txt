IC vs UC 0-0
IC's bold, attacking style o f play
r e a l l y s h o w e d i n t h i s h i g h -
missing 0-0 draw with UC.
Solid at the back, dominating
midfield and looking good going
forward I C were soon in control;
G r a h a m a n d J o h n Rigby (im-
pressive o n this rare appearance
in t h e h i g h e r reaches o f t h e
game) went close as I C again
failed to turn pressure into goals.
After the oranges I C surged
forward looking for the goal
which would have sealed the
game. Even Steve D u n h i l l had a
s h o t — m i s s i n g b y a m a r g i n
n e a r i n g t h e size o f D e a n o ' s
stomach!
D u r i n g a rare m o m e n t o f
danger K e v (while aiming at the
pavilion two fields away) m a n -
aged to give the ball straight to a
U C f o r w a r d b u t Steve ( w i t h
goalkeeper A l a n clinging des-
perately to his leg) was there to
clear the ball off the line.
The game ended with I C again
attacking, a string o f corners
proving the A n d y Page theory—
if you put enough men i n the
box, you've got about as much
chance o f scoring as G r i m s b y .
I C vs Westminster Hosp 5-1
The thrills o f the C u p came early
to L o n d o n last week. A s Enfield
and Dagenham (yes, it should
have been Tooting) prepared to
take o n the league giants (?) i n
the F A C u p , I C 1st X I were
beginning their defence o f T H E
C u p . Carnivalitis was diagnosed
as t h e m a j o r r e a s o n f o r t h e
d r a w n f i r s t m a t c h b u t , f o r
thereplay, all were recovered.
The opposition's late arrival
meant it could have gone to
penalties, i f drawn again. W e
couldn't agree o n an order for
the five, so we thought w e ' d
better win before the need arose.
I C s t a r t e d i n p a r a l y s i n g (?)
form, but the usual catalogue o f
misses built up. Finally...success.
Stephenson sliding i n Rickard's
free kick, and then latching on to
M c G u c k i n ' s quick free kick to
make it two. Slinky felt out o f it
so he looped i n a long one,
showing G r i f f how to d o it.
3-0? We've done enough. Let
t h e m p l a y a b i t . M i s t a k e .
Westminster pushed menacingly
f o r w a r d , e v e n t u a l l y f o r c i n g
Pinochio C u r r a n to viciously
hack down their man. Penalty!
3-1 at half-time.
Second half a n d they really
P a g e l 6 H K H H H H M H M I
thought they had a chance. N o t
so. Stephenson d i d a passable
impression o f the Deano Weeble
over the goalkeeper leaving ice-
cool (?) Reeve to score from the
spot. The game was as good as
over. I C began to ravage the
opposition with a succession o f
fluent moves (managed to pass
to each other, not them!), the
best o f which saw Slinky drive a
volley home from fifty (probably
a lot less!) yards.
In the dying seconds P i n n o -
chio made the by-line o n the
right and produced, at last, the
perfect far post cross. There was
M c G u c k i n , unmarked, one yard
out. W o u l d he head it, kick i t ,
even touch it? Rising like the
proverbial salmon he placed the
ball very neatly, for a goal kick!

Dunhill, Griffiths, Lay, Page,
McGuckin, Dean, Stephenson,
Rickard.
Fourths
IC vs RFH I 2-0
The Fourths travelled away and
they certainly cut some dashing
figures o n the tube; none more
so than J o h n H e r d i n a stylish
combat jacket. Onto the match,
and this was certainly a game o f
two halves, Brian. In the first
h a l f , w h i c h w a s p l a y e d first,
Russ Thomas bagged two goals
in his debut for the Fourths. In
the s e c o n d , n o b o d y s c o r e d ,
certainly not Russ, wise to the
fact that another goal could cost
h i m a j u g . S o w e w o n 2 - 0 ,
c o m p l e t i n g t h e d o u b l e o v e r
R F H 1 this season. A t the team
meal afterwards, pie and beans,
there was much talk o f ambition,
J o h n Rigby is still hoping to eat
a whole curry o n his own and
maybe even score as well.

I C V t h X I have recently risen t o
the depths o f mediocrity after
two marginal wins over G u y s II

seeking their first win this season

during which they managed to
string two passes together for the

stunning brilliance o f I C should
not, however, be overshadowed
by any unrepresentative results

Sixths
IC vs UCH II 5-4
After Saturdays 6-0 thrashing at
the hands o f L H 3 a n d a p r e -
match drinking ban imposed by
captain, goalkeeper and general
hero N i c k D a w s o n , our hopes o f
a better start quickly evaporated
as U C H took control, and the
lead with t w o goals i n the first
t w e n t y m i n u t e s . T h e first o f
these a particularly magnificent
own goal by Dave K e e n , glancing
t h e b a l l p a s t h i s c o n f u s e d
captain.
However showing great char-
acter the sixths rallied to level
the score at half time with a
b r i l l i a n t g o a l d i r e c t f r o m a
corner by O ' C o n n e r , and a long
range effort from Peter Rodgers
which found the far corner from
all o f forty yards.
After a lucky break U C H took
the lead again from a penalty but
again IC's persistence paid off
w h e n a f i n e f r e e k i c k f r o m
O ' C o n n e r found the back o f the
net.
Another quick break by the
h o m e t e a m f o u n d us b e h i n d
again but two late goals, the first
a well-finished run through by
J o h n Kevendi and the second on
an opportunist effort by M a r t i n
Kellerman sealed U C H ' s fate.

A f t e r last week's r a t h e r u n -
successful escapade; D C I W a l l
d e c i d e d t o t r y h e r h a n d a t
something new. Since there were
no other pressing engagements
Wall's incidental crime squad
were t o a s s i s t D I B e l l a n d
F r a n k l i n o f the porn squad i n
locating the last few copies o f
a h a r d c o r e m a g a z i n e ' T h e
Ladies H o c k e y Report'.
H a v i n g incured difficulty i n
finding the local force D C I W a l l
and her men set about digging
up a local turnip field where
copies o f the R a g were k n o w n to
be buried.
A l t h o u g h W P C s Mason's and
Whitehead's agricultural skills
were staggering; their fine efforts
were rather hampered by D C I
Eldridge's habit o f filling in the
holes by falling i n the mud.
After about half an hour the
s q u a d s u d d e n l y r e a l i s e d that
D C I Ayers o f the First D i v i s i o n
h a d t u r n e d u p c o m p l a i n i n g

bobbies with displays o f inepti-
t u d e r a r e l y s e e n e x c e p t a t
Swansea City home ties.
Thus with confusion reigning
supreme, the magazines still not
located and the rain drenching
our heroes (and heroines) we are
forced to ask the question: will
D C I W a l l ever catch the scoun-
drel responsible for this corrup-
tive magazine? If you're really
