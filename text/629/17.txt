Firsts
I C vs LSE 9-0
Despite a last minute change in
venue, all the players manage to
arrive o n time. The opposition
team came with only five players.
One o f their players arrived late
and then perfofmed a disappear-
ing act which even baffled his
teammates. Still, the final result
was decisive; they lost all their
games. Seems like we are o n our
way to retaining the C u p this
season—well done lads.
Players: / Bull, D Demico, T
Lai, L Yap, P Smith, S Chiang.

first t w o games were over i n
about ten minutes, U C managing
to get seven points in four sets.
After that, they folded without
as much as a fight, oh, come to
think o f it, there was almost a
fight. I n the last game when we
were 8-0 up, we were doing our
best to give them a game, when
they decided to start cheating.

were good debuts from T i m and

The backs failed to move the ball
