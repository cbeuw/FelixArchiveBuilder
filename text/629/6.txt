Last week Phil Nathan gave the reasons for re-
affiliation to the NUS. This week Paul Simion
and J Martin Taylor give the other side of the
argument.

Imperial College Union was a founder member of the NUS in 1922 but
has had an unsteady relationship with it throughout its history. When
we last disaffiliated in January 1978 it was after the longest ever period
of membership, just seven years. The referendum which ended our
affiliation had, it is true, a slim majority for the anti-NUS side.
However, last week's article fails to point out that a second referendum
held a year after the first reaffirmed our decision to leave the NUS by a
majority of nearly 350 despite the strong pro-NUS campaign organised
by the ICU President and other officers.
W e believe that the arguments against joining the N U S are as
strong as ever, and that i f a politically motivated minority were able
to persuade enough people to vote for reaffiliation it would be a
major financial disaster for I C U . S o in this article we have examined
the collection of distorted facts and half-truths put forward last week
as 'overwhelming evidence' for affiliating to the N U S , and outlined
the powerful arguments against it.
Representation to Government
Last week it was said that the
N U S 'negotiates' with the D E S
on grants, prescription charges
(sic), etc. In fact the N U S is
neither officially recognised as
representing students n o r is it
negotiated with i n any way by
the Government. Ministers from
the D E S do talk to N U S repre-
sentatives when they request a
meeting, but they have also met
I C U sabbatical officers i n the
past, and it could be argued that
ministers are more likely to take
views from I C U directly if we are
outside N U S . A n y w a y the most
e f f e c t i v e w a y o f i n f l u e n c i n g
Government policy is by corres-
ponding with ministers and M P s
which I C U frequently does and
which is open to all students.
W i t h grants what happens in
practice is that the N U S every
year calculates a grant claim
(invariably o f huge proportions)
based on the past value of the
grant and sends it to the G o v e r n -
ment. Last year this was 17.3%
(although they said it should
have been 30%!). T h e G o v e r n -
ment then gives us an increase
bearing no relation whatsoever
to the N U S demand ( 4 % last
y e a r ) . T o d e s c r i b e t h i s as
negotiation is a misuse o f the
English language. T o quote from
last week's article: " I t is the
strength o f N U S . . . w h i c h gives us
a 4 % grant increase." That
speaks for itself, N U S is o b -
viously not very strong!
In fact since the N U S started
i s s u i n g d e m a n d s f o r g r a n t
increases i n 1962 the real value
has fallen by 30%. The fact that
students are seen as a soft targets
by a l l Governments whatever
their political complexion is at

spend all their time o n demon-
strations a n d sit-ins, which the
N U S is instrumental i n perpetu-
ating. (Last year the N U S called
a 'strike' of students i n support
of its grant claim.)

The N U S it is said prevented
the i n t r o d u c t i o n o f s t u d e n t
loans. In reality, whatever the
pros and cons of such a system
the Government has so far not
introduced it because of the high
cost involved, which is unaccept-
able to the Treasury.
The Cost of NUS
Irrespective o f the arguments
against N U S membership o n the

these fixed costs into account
gives a figure o f about 15% of all
I C U ' s disposable income, so a
cut o f this amount in the money
a v a i l a b l e f o r c l u b s , societies,
entertainments, C C U s and other
student activities would be the

affiliation fee. Y e t last week's
a r t i c l e d e s c r i b e s f i n a n c i a l
a r g u m e n t s a g a i n s t N U S a s
'foolish a n d short-sighted'. W e
do not believe that the dubious
benefits of N U S membership are
worth a great reduction i n the
sporting, recreational and social
facilities provided by the U n i o n ,
which are after all the primary
reasons for its existence.
The Sad History of N U S Services
U p until 1976 N U S owned and
ran a large number of service
companies including Endsleigh
Insurance, N U S Services L t d
a n d N U S T r a v e l . I n 1 9 7 6
N U S Travel went bankrupt. The
k n o c k - o n effect of this was that
all the N U S companies went into
debt, N U S Services also went
out of business a n d Endsleigh
was sold to the D u t c h company
G o u d a . N U S ' s only remaining
c o m p a n y , N U S M a r k e t i n g ,
which runs the discount card
scheme, is losing money since
t h e M i d l a n d B a n k s t o p p e d
buying the cards a n d N U S are
trying, unsuccessfully as yet, to
sell it. A n d yet last week's article
suggests N U S is the organisation
to ask for financial advice!
Such student services that are
c u r r e n t l y a v a i l a b l e , s u c h as
Railcards a n d I S I C cards, are
commercial ventures which have
no connection with N U S . L o n -

NUS Organisation
Last week's article decries the .
notion that N U S is ineffectual
and badly organised. O n e only
need examine the current strike
by N U S staff to see otherwise. In
an effort to introduce a modicum
of efficiency, changes in w o r k i n g
practice were proposed which
t h e s t a f f r e j e c t e d a n d t h e n
walked out, leaving the N U S
paralysed. I n truth N U S is a
large bureaucratic organisation

NUS Democracy
It is true that N U S is examining
w a y s o f h a v i n g c o m p u l s o r y
elections for delegates. There is
nothing new in this, they've been
looking at it for years. But there
will always have to be exceptions
for the numerous small colleges
which haven't the facilities to
hold elections. It is from these
small colleges that most o f the
p o l i t i c a l l y extreme delegates
originate. There are so many o f
these small colleges that their
delegates form a large block at
the conference, and it is difficult
to e v e n f i n d o u t h o w t h e i r
delegates a r e a p p o i n t e d . T h e
present drive for democracy i n
N U S is unlikely to change the
present situation significantly.
