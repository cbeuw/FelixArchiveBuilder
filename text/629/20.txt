I make no apology for a return visit to the
Victoria and Albert Museum! It is my favourite
in the South Kensington cluster of museums
(musea?), possibly because it is the least prone
to invasion by hordes of school children; but
certainly, to some extent, because it provides
such a refreshing contrast to science and
technology, whether of the lab/lecture variety
at I C , or of the glass cabinet/push button
variety at the museums of Natural History,
Science and Geology.
T h e n e w e n t r a n c e t o t h e V & A , o n
E x h i b i t i o n R o a d , is n o w o p e n . It is part-
entrance hall, part-gallery, connecting the
primary collections of the V & A with the new
Henry Cole Building, due to be opened next
spring. Twelve bronzes by Rodin are displayed
here. They were given to the V & A by Rodin in
O c t o b e r 1 9 1 4 , after b e i n g s h o w n at a n
exhibition of French Art at Grosvenor House
earlier that year. If Rodin links the Romantic
and Modern movements in sculpture, then
these bronzes are a most appropriate link
between the old part of the museum and its
new wing.
Images from the Theatre Museum
In 1985 the Theatre Museum will open in the
converted Flower Market in Covent Garden.
In the meantime (to break the idea in gently?) it
will stage a series of exhibitions in temporary
galleries at the V & A . The first of these 'Show
Business'- is in Rooms 70-73, on the first floor.
It is a very well staged exhibition. The 'foyer'
is the entrance to the Big Top, hung with
peppermint-striped canvas. T h e three other
rooms are devoted to performers, production,
and publicity and place: they are spotlit and
the L O O K S E E is accompanied by a sound-
track that cheerfully juxtaposes the Beatles
w i t h a c o l o r a t u r a s o p r a n o . T h i s a u r a l
patchwork reflects the visual patchwork of the
exhibition as a whole: the Theatre Museum is
concerned with all the live performing arts:
"...and stay out!" - an exhibit from Images from
the Theatre.
Review of the Invincible Brigade or Female
Cavalry...The first paper programme did not
appear in this country till the 1850s, so an
illustrated playbill had to act both as poster
and as sources of detailed information.
P r o p s o n show include G a r r i c k ' s trick
dagger with a retractable blade and Mist-
inguette's pink o s t r i c h feather fan. C e c i l
Beatonk's costume for Julie Andrews, in the
Embassy Ball scene of My Fair Lady, stands
beside A d a m Ant's from the Prince Charming
Revue. The principle boy's costume worn in an
1880s pantomime conveys all the Victorians'
p r e o c c u p a t i o n w i t h o p u l e n t c u r v e s a n d
c o n t r a s t s brashly with M a r c e l M a r c e a u ' s
expression of awed intensity as he watches a
seed grow (in a black and white still, blown up
to life size).
It's very much an exhibition of bits—but
some of them are gems, and certainly worth an
odd half hour one lunchtime.

Orchestral Manoeuvres
Imperial College Symphony Orchestra are
playing a concert next Friday in the Great Hall
at 8:00pm. Among the pieces they are playing
is 'The Planets' by Hoist, which consists of
seven movements, which for convenience I
shall number (and refer to as) one to seven.
I caught up with Andy, Brian, Chris and
Dominic (one of whom is a string player, one of
whom is a woodwind player, one of whom is a
brass player and one of whom is a percus-
s i o n i s t ( n o b o d y p l a y s m o r e t h a n o n e
instrument)) in the Queen's Legs the other
day. Eager to find o u t more about this
wonderful suite by Hoist, I asked them for their
preferences. Before you hear what they had to
say, a word of warning—musicians are not all
strictly honest, a n d the accuracy of their
statements is. governed by the accuracy of the
instruments they play. Hence:
a) String players don't always hit the right
note, and hence they tell alternately truth, then
a lie, then the truth, etc (although not always
necessarily the truth first).
b) Woodwind players cannot easily alter the
accuracy of the note, and so always tell the
truth.
c) Brass players will start off honest, but as
the results of excessive alcoholic indulgence
set in, they start lying; thus every statement
they make which contains the words five, six
or seven is false, any other statement being
true (eg "1 is better than 3" would be true, "3 is
better than 5" would be false).
d) Percussionists always play too loudly, in
the wrong places, and in the wrong tempo, and
so every statement they make is false.
N o w back to the conversation.
Brian steeled himself to speak first "1 is
better than 4" he ventured. " A n d six is better
than 3" said Andy. "But 2 is better than 6" said
Chris. "7 is better than 6, as well" said Brian.
" A n d 7 is better than 5, old boy" said Dominic.
"Strange, but 4 is better than 7" said Andy. "I
agree fully" said Dominic. "3 is better than 5,"
said Chris, "although two is better than 3."
(this counts as two statements). "7 is better
than 2," said Brian, "and 2 is better than 5." "But
listen, old boy," said Dominic, "6 is better than
4." " O h no," said Andy, "4 is better than 6," no
doubt thinking of the luscious trombone bits.
"There's at least 2 movements better than 5
that are worse than one" said Dominic as
Chris departed with a viola player, thereby
ending the conversation.
At this moment the conductor extricated
himself from the clutches of a b a r m a i d ,
wandered over, and told me that in fact their
preferences were all in the same order (the
conductor incidentally, is a woodwind player).
So who then was from each section, and in
what order did they put the pieces?
All similarities to any persons alive, dead, or
this year's chairman are entirely intentional.
Orchestra members note that the order of
preference does not coincide with the author's
nor are the people portrayed necessarily in the
correct sections. All in-jokes copyright.

Last Week's Solution
Last week's puzzle was unfortunately rather
easy, although I didn't think so when I set it.
The correct answer was that the rumours
occurred when the President was aged 72, 81,
84 and 96. 52 people idecided that it was easy
(only one person sent in an incorrect entry),
and the lucky winner was Brian Clarkson of
C h e m Eng 3, who can collect his £5 cheque
from the F E L I X Office after 1:30pm on Mon-
day.
