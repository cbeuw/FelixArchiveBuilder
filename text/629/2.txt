late for a meeting of the Industrial
Society on Tuesday because his
train was delayed.
In his address, entitled 'Strikes
—the Ultimate Sanction', M r
B u c k t o n stressed the plight of
the o v e r w o r k e d , u n d e r p a i d
workers leading to the recent
R a i l strike that cost British R a i l
£ 1 0 0 m . H e gave vent to his
disappointment with the Fleet
Street view of the strike, des-
cribing their attacks on h i m and
his union supporters as trash.
Referring to the possibility of
another strike in the near future,

hopscotch along the pavement.

people or don't like your course
or are feeling puzzled or tired.
Or maybe everything is fine—
you just want to find out what's
on at different colleges or train
times or a late night chemist.
