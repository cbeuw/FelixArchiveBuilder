SOUTHSIDE MOVE: COLLEGE TRIES AGAIN
The projected move of Union facilities to Southside is again a real
possibility after a meeting of the Southside Working Party and
members of the Estates Section on Thursday afternoon. Most Union
representation seem to approve of the plan as set out by the College, but
they will insist on certain safeguards and guarantees before committing
the Union.
T h e C o l l e g e p r o p o s a l s as
o u t l i n e d b y D o n C l a r k o f
Estates is that over the next four
years, all U n i o n facilities should
move from Beit Q u a d to the
lower levels o f Southside, which
are at present underused. T h e
Post Experience Centre could
then be established in Beit. (This
is a plan to run short courses for
i n d u s t r y , a n d is expected t o
bring a large amount o f money
into College.) T h e move would
start with the building o f new
sports facilities, including glass-
backed squash courts, a new
theatre and, once the Southside
S h o p h a s m o v e d t o l a r g e r
premises, all the U n i o n adminis-
tration, and offices. N o plans to
move the F E L I X Office have
been put forward.
U n i o n officers still have major
r e s e r v a t i o n s ; they c o n s i d e r it
suspicious that College should
o f f e r t o u n d e r t a k e s o m u c h
e x p e n d i t u r e o n t h e U n i o n ' s
behalf, and want legal guarantees
that the money will be spent as
promised. They are also querying
the claim that it would be more
costly to simply build the Post
Experience Centre i n Southside.
O t h e r q u e s t i o n s t h a t t h e y
w o u l d like answered include the
probable life o f the Southside
Building ( D o n Clark told the
meeting that he has an estimate
of over a hundred years) and the
noise problem; residents of the
M e w s h a v e been k n o w n f o
complain of the noise of pool
balls i n F a l m o u t h - K e o g h H a l l .
T h e matter is long referred t o
the U n i o n M a j o r Subcommit-
tees, a n d as soon as a detailed
costing has been made there will
be a f u r t h e r m e e t i n g o f t h e
W o r k i n g Party; it is possible that
the matter will get as far as a
U G M before Christmas.
GUILDSHIT HITS THE FAN
Several hundred copies of Guildsheet were replaced by a satirical
imitation entitled 'Guildshit' on Wednesday morning. F o r his
involvement in removing the official publications, Union Welfare
Officer Jon Barnett has been accused of theft by members of City and
Guilds Union and by Stephen Goulder, 1CU President.
'Guildshit' was produced by Wednesday morning when they

traditional fashion.

Officer, in reprisal for a series of
attacks on himself i n several of
the year's issues, primarily in the
'Hissing S i d ' column written by
J o n S t a n l e y . M r P y n e t o l d
F E L I X that replacing Guildsheet
with a parody was the only way
to make his protest in a forceful
but humorous way. T h e issue
was written by M r Pyne a n d
several close friends, a n d was
copied at his home on his o w n
duplicating machine, except for
the cover, which like that o f
Guildsheet, was printed i n the
U n i o n Print U n i t â€” b u t without
the official knowledge of the
Print Unit Manager. D i s t r i b u -

an official letter saying that he
considered that Guildshit was far

printed in Guildsheet this year,
and accusing him of intolerance
and theft. But handwritten at the
foot o f the letter he had added
" P S : I thought the issue was
hilarious."
