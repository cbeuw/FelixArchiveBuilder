shoes for that memorable scene with Ingrid
Bergman in Notorious.
I could be wrong, but I think this is the first
time a tribute has been undertaken in this way.
The result is a shade irreverant and bears
comparison with Woody Allen's tribute to the
film noir world of Bogart in P/ay It Again Sam.
In Allen's film he is worshipping his hero and
•IREVIEWSI
trying to emulate Bogart's sexual image to his
mundane world. Rigby as the dick-head private
dick takes to the whole lifestyle and tries to
introduce more modern dialogue. The result is
humour as Rigby struggles with the oversize
mantle he has inherited from Marlowe. The
superhuman control we expect, as the n n
tries to break through the mask, the emotions
betrayed in the narrative rather than the face,
contrasted with the transparent Reardon, who
takes advantage of Juliet Forest; the rather
lack-lustre heroine, when she faints into his
arms on their first encounter.
I unreservedly recommend this film to any
fan of the tough guy-sleuth genre, or those
w h o enjoy s o p h i s t i c a t e d h u m o u r , w h i c h ,
although occasionally misfiring, n o r m a l l y
succeeds in getting a laugh; some of the
wisecracks are worthy of Marlowe himself.

'Dead Man' Reardon foils the vile plot.
Privileged, AA, Directed by Michael
Hoffman.
Privileged is a film about O x f o r d under-
g r a d u a t e s , a n d w a s w r i t t e n , d i r e c t e d ,
p r o d u c e d a n d a c t e d p r i m a r i l y by O x f o r d
students. It is rather surprising, therefore, to
discover that technically the film is very good,
surpassing many produced on a much larger
budget by far more experienced film-makers.
A s a piece of entertainment, though, it is
rather disappointing; the plot fails to live up to
the standard of the other ingredients of the
film.
The story concerns Edward, an Oxford
u n d e r g r a d u a t e w h o is a gifted a c t o r , a
womaniser, and a thoroughly nasty piece of
work. The film follows his relationship with
A n n , a fellow student. A n n and Edward, and
indeed most of the other main characters, are
involved in the University Dramatic Society's
production of The Duchess of Malfi. Parts of
this play are seen in rehearsal and performance
during the course of the film, and one is left
with a nagging feeling that some of the action
in the play might parallel in some way the story
unfolding around it. If this is the case, however,
it is never really made clear enough; if it isn't,
too much attention is focused on the play.
The problem with presenting a love story
such as this is that, because neither of the
main protagonists evoke any sympathy, there
is no great feeling of involvement with the plot.
The m a k e r s claim that the film gives an
accurate account of contemporary under-
graduate life at Oxford. If this is so, then the
suspicions of many IC students are indeed
correct—Oxford students are a bunch of
arrogant obnoxious bastards. There are only
three likable characters in the film, and all
three of them get stamped on in one way or
another. Jamie and Lord Adrian both suffer
from Edward's treatment of the two women
they respectively love, and Imogen, a friend of
Ann's, is assaulted in an incident which seems
to have only a coincidental connection with the
main plot.
Despite the deficiencies in storyline, though,
it must be said again that this is a well made
and well acted film, and it is to be hoped that
the people involved will go on to greater things.

Hungry
M u c h to the chagrin of the Musician's Union,
the d r e a d e d s y n t h e s i s e r has g a i n e d in
popularity over the last year and a bit, due
largely to Soft Cell's superbly sparse Tainted
Love/Where Did Our Love Go, a n d the
r e j u v i n a t e d H u m a n L e a g u e . T h e l a t t e r
producing a string of dance floor hits pepped
up by p r o d u c e r M a r t i n R u s h e n ' s L i n n
Computer drums (replacing the rather weedy
rhythm boxes of old with some much-needed
muscle). Now, hardly a week goes by without
yet another electropop band on Top of the
Pops. C o m p a r e d to the e c o n o m y of an
'isolation' or a 'temptation', the razor-sharp
arrangements of 'New Life' or a 'Don't G o ' , the
likes of Thomas Dolby, Tears for Fears, China
Crisis (and even Soft Cell of late), leave much
to be desired with new tunes that are finicky
and weak; too much sugar-coating on a soft
centre. So it's refreshing to listen to Happy
Families (London) by Blancmange who at least
sound hungry as opposed to well-fed and
bloated. It contains their current success
'Living on the Ceiling', the third in a run of fine
singles, all of which you'll find here. I hope they
get a r o u n d to r e l e a s i n g the a b r a s i v e
instrumentals they wrote for Micha Bergese's
dance group 'Mantis'. The Passage augment
their electronics with guitar, and a flesh and
blood drummer, their new album Degenerates
(Cherry Red) finds them further refining their
highly original sound with songs that range
from the gay abandon of 'Xoyo' to the uneasy
peace of 'Love Is As'. More than enough for
the converted, but unlikely to win new fans.
The live Passage is a different beast altogether
as they showed at IC recently; a formidable
barrage of rhythm and electronics, spiced with
Dick Witts' lyrical attacks on government and
church, displaying a naked power only hinted
at on vinyl, (their encore of 'Lost In Music' is
the a l t e r - e g o of the a s s o c i a t e s ' L o v e
Hangover'). Dip into their singles selection,
especially the recent 'Xoyo' as" which boasts a
superior version of 'Born Every Minute', that is
truly 'Dancing Through Dark Times'.
Since 'Don't Y o u Want Me', released at the
end of 1981, the Human League haven't made
a noise until the current hit 'Mirror Man'. No
radical departure from formula. Without Phil
and Suzanne crooning at each other, the
nation switched its attention to David and
Theresa—Dollar. I was going to suggest that
you buy someone 'The Dollar Album' (WEA)
for Christmas so you could tape the excellent
string of Trevor Horn-produced singles that
ranged from 'Hand Held in Black and White' to
'Videotheque'. Don't!—Buy the singles instead
as the dippy duo have produced a number of
self-penned turkeys, and re-mixed the hits with
dire consequences. 'Give me Back my Heart'
suffers from heavy-handedness, and under
Dollar's hands falls on the wrong side of
overproduction, and anyway, 'Mirror Mirror',
with its Kraftwerk-like acknowledgment of
space and minimalism, remains the finest
electropop of the year.
Three recent re-releases at around £3; C B S
have The Clash's first album out again, whilst
EMI come up with 'Searching for the Young
Soul Rebels', the Dexys M k 1 Stax/Motown
homage. 'Fourth Drawer D o w n ' (Situation 2)
by The Associates is currently gracing the
racks at the H M V Shop in Oxford Street, and
as this essential selection of pre-'Suck' singles
was previously only available as a pricey
German import, it's well worth snapping up.
Simple Minds have come on in leaps and
bounds since their watered-down magazine
days, and as the third single to be lifted from
'New G o l d Dream' (Virgin), slips into the
' F a b u l o u s F u n F o r t y ' , cast an ear to the
album—more luxurious, seamless, sinewy pop
from the 'Sons and Fascination' stable. Also on
Virgin, Culture Club's 'Kissing to be Clever',
yet another greatest hits for a debut, you'll find
their recent single hit here, plus the superlative
'White Boy', and 'I'm Afraid of M e ' singles too.
At times Boy George's harmonies rival the
Jacksons—no mean feat! From the sweetest
boy to 'The Sweetest Girl', the oldest and still
the finest track on Scritti Politti's 'Songs To
Remember' (Rough Trade). Svengali Green
parades his gospel/funk/swing influences for
all to see, but this adds up to much more than
mere plagarism. Check the winsome 'Jacques
Perida'; a new era of late light music? Apart
from a new, rambling 'Lions After Slumber'
a n d the o d d l y t r u n c a t e d 7" v e r s i o n of
'Faithless', an album to savour.
To pointless singles: The Higsons' 'Tear the
Whole Thing Down' on Two-Tone, is too
tinny, and not enough funky, and quite why a
Certain Ratio should record a new version of
'Knife Slits Water' (Factory) as dull and lifeless
as this is beyond me. Instead, a quick plug for
their colourful 'sextet' album which ranges
from the usual abstract funk on 'Below the
C a n a l ' to the m o c k - L a t i n f r i v o l i t y of
'Skipscada, everything pivoting around the
original tense and uneasy version of 'Knife'.
Lastly, the biggest delight of the week was
hearing the new album from Siouxsie and
Bandshees called ' A Kiss in the Dreamhouse'
(Polydor) this is their best yet. Whilst 'Ju-ju'
produced a couple of excellent singles in
'Spellbound' and 'Arabian Nights', and boasted
the excellent guitaring of John M c G e o c h , the
structure of the songs was essentially the usual
B a n s h e e s w h i r l p o o l of gothic h o r r o r and
childhood nightmares. 'Cascades' the opening
track sets the tone; a nod to the past, but also
a vanguard for the new style, less claustro-
phobic than of old, with pan pipes and mardi
gras alongside Severin's insistent bass lines
and McGeogh's chimgin guitar. Consume!
