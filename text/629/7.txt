ability to do their jobs well, their
political composition is hardly a
recipe for moderation.
The Membership of N U S
One of the N U S ' s proud boasts
is its slogan; ' N U S , one million
members, one movement'. Apart
from the obvious fact that the
idea of a l l students s t a n d i n g
shoulder to shoulder behind the
N U S ' s policies is quite ridicu-
lous, one of its weaknesses is its
very diverse membership. M e m -
bers of N U S range from sixteen
year olds resitting O Levels to
mature P G students who are
married with two kids and a
mortgage, and just about every-
one else in between. There have
even been suggestions of admit-
ting the unemployed to N U S
membership. The many different
types of student in N U S have
little or nothing in common,
which makes the 'one move-
ment' claim look a bit hollow.
U n i v e r s i t y students do have
something in common, but they
are just a minority in the N U S .
In order to bolster its mem-
bership figures still further N U S
is now trying to recruit from
sixth forms in secondary schools,
although already it has been
banned by at least one education
authority.
M a n y colleges and universities
have left the N U S or are con-
sidering doing so. Often apathy
is the only reason they remain
a f f i l i a t e d . I C U has r e c e i v e d
several enquiries over the past
few years from other student
u n i o n s abut h o w we s u r v i v e
outside N U S . P r e s e n t l y most
S c o t t i s h u n i v e r s i t i e s , m a n y
O x b r i d g e colleges a n d K i n g s
C o l l e g e , L o n d o n are m a j o r
institutions outside N U S .
It is only one year since the
N U S issue was last debated at
IC, when it was also raised by
the same group of people. A t
that time despite the presence of
the N U S President at the U G M
and other N U S hacks in the
preceeding weeks the motion
s u p p o r t i n g r e a f f i l i a t i o n was
overwhelmingly defeated. The
N U S President left I C in no
doubt about what students here
think about N U S .
Even to hold a referendum
would cost about £300. M a k e
sure that even this money is not
wasted by t u r n i n g up at the
U G M on December 7 to vote
down any motion calling for a
referendum.
