U G M : A B O R E D G A M E F O R
C H I L D R E N O F A L L A G E S
1. There should be at least 300 participants. A shorter version
involving fewer people is available and is called 'Quorum
Caller'.
2. The players elect a Chairman who puts on a pink
turban/red nose/false beard/wooden leg or similar and starts the
game with the words "I open this UGM at six minutes past one".
3. A speaker is chosen at the Chairman's discretion. (The
Chairman's discretion is, of course, legendary-that is, totally
mythical.)
4. The speaker must talk for two minutes on any subject
without repetition, hesitation, deviation, punctuation or
mentioning the NUS.
5. The remaining players should attempt to put him off by
booing, hissing, shouting and suggesting procedural motions.
6. Players may also interrupt by attempting to 'submit
information' out of turn. When this happens, the Chairman
shouts, 'Shut up Stephen!' and scores a point.
7. Politics may only be introduced when no-one can think of
motions. Like mathematics, politics is merely a substitute for
thought. Suitable games for quasi-political boring hacks are
'University of London Union', 'NUS' and 'Euthanasia'.
8. The Chairman always wins because only he really
understands what is going on. The person who has won most
games at the end of the year is elected Union President and must
shave off his beard for charity.
The U n i o n General Meeting is
the policy-making body of I C U .
Campus-wide elections, ballots,
manifestos a n d referenda are
merely a hangover from demo-
cratic idealism, a n d should be
abolished altogether. T o justify
this rather dramatic piece of
anarchy, a cerain amount o f
boring background is necessary.
Democracy is the rule of the
people, for the people, by the
people—one person, one vote,
and if that sounds like a recipe
f o r t h e u l t i m a t e c o m m i t t e e
meeting, that is exactly what it
is. It was even invented b y a
c o m m i t t e e — a n d i n G r e e k at
that. In fact, Ancient Greece and
R o m e were the first attempted
democratic states, a n d the fact
that both collapsed (through bad
government) rather a long time
ago does not alter the fact that
we still worship their ideas of
democracy without really under-
standing them.
T h i s i d e a l i s a b s o l u t e l y
impractical, so what happens is
that the actual business o f ruling
is carried out by a group of
p e o p l e e l e c t e d b y u n i v e r s a l
suffrage. This ruling body does
the work for y o u , a n d if y o u
don't like the results y o u elect
s o m e o n e else t h e n e x t t i m e
r o u n d .
A t this point the system begins
to f a l l a p a r t . F i r s t l y , y o u r
representatives spend more time
trying to get re-elected than they
do actually governing. Secondly,
the whole business became so
specialised that the only people
w h o really k n o w what is happen-
ing are those i n government. A t
this point, the idea of a referen-
d u m o n (for example) whether to
leave the E E C becomes pointless,
b e c a u s e the d e c i s i o n is then
taken by fifty million people
who have not the slightest idea
of what they are voting about,
except what they pick up from the
t e l e v i s i o n a n d n e w s p a p e r s ,
which are not necessarily u n -
biased—in fact, political broad-
casts and publicity ensure that
this is so.
T h i s i s r o u g h l y w h a t i s
happening at Imperial; U n i o n
officers are elected b y guesswork
or by default (any semi-literate
hack could be Publicity Officer
by n o w if he h a d stood for the
post). Sabbaticals are not elected
by the people w h o have worked
w i t h t h e m a n d k n o w t h e i r
capabilities, but by a n electorate
that will only have a photograph
and a page of publicity from
which to judge.
Last year's presidential elec-
tion was a case in point. A t the
first stage, Stephen G o u l d e r was
only a handful of votes ahead of
B o b H o l d i n g , w h o stood as a
' j o k e c a n d i d a t e ' a n d w o u l d
probably have been the worst
President since...(insert name as
reader thinks fit). I n fact, i f he
had had a few more supporters,
he m i g h t h a v e b e e n i n t h e
embarrassing position of occupy-
ing a post that he did not really
want, having been chosen by a
random candidate-selection pro-
cess which favours (in order o f
importance), h u m o u r , original
publicity, good legs, ability to
ridicule people at U G M s and in
the F E L I X letters pages and the
conviction with which refectory
.boycotts are promised.
A s a n additional problem (I
quote unashamedly) it is a well-
k n o w n fact that the last peson
who should be given power is the
one w h o wants it so badly that
he will start his campaign a term
in advance. (Question: w h o is
c a r r y i n g o u t a N i c k P y n e
defamation campaign i n pre-
p a r a t i o n f o r the p r e s i d e n t i a l
election? Answers on a plain

Abolish Elections
The idea of a referendum is
even m o r e l u d i c r o u s — t h a t i f
there is something so important
that no-one can reach a decision,
it s h o u l d be d e c i d e d b y five
thousand people w h o have not
t h e f a i n t e s t i d e a w h a t t h e
consequences o f their decision
will be. A s a n obvious example,
do y o u really k n o w more about
the N U S than y o u have read in
the newspaper articles or talked
about i n bars? If not, than y o u
are probably i n n o position to
vote in any future referendum on
the subject.
The logical conclusion is that
that a l l v i t a l U n i o n business
s h o u l d be c a r r i e d o u t b y a
U G M . C o l l e g e - w i d e e l e c t i o n s
and referenda should be abo-
lished, so that at least voters
w o u l d have a chance of hearing
people w h o k n o w what they are
talking about before casting the
votes. If you cannot be bothered
to t u r n u p t o a U G M , y o u
probably should not be allowed
near a ballot-box anyway. A t
least the majority of those w h o
a t t e n d a r e ( c o m p a r a t i v e l y )
responsible—I was pleasantly
s u r p r i s e d w h e n a t t h e l a s t
(obviously inquorate) meeting
the Q u o r u m Caller Extraodinary
waited until after an important
but boring motion o n the B a r
Subcommittee before doing his
bit.
I e x p e c t at least a d o z e n
shocked letters accusing me of
being an anarchist, communist
or m e r e l y r a v i n g l u n a t i c f o r
attempting to remove the ' k '
from Democracy (think about
it). T o forestall a few arguments,
I shall close with the faults that I
have been able to think of in this
system.
Solutions, comments, critic-
isms, men in white coats to me at
the FELIX Office, Wednesday
1:00pm.
The first fault is that people
w h o c a n n o t g e t t o U G M s
because of prior commitments
(or just a desire to eat lunch o n
Tuesdays a n d Thursdays) lose
their only previous say in U n i o n
affairs. The second is that not all
competent sabbatical candidates
are eloquent speakers—it is easy
to vote for an impressive piece of
o r a t o r y b y a p o t e n t i a l l y b a d
U n i o n officer. T h i r d l y , we could
end up with far too many people
at U G M s — t h e Great H a l l has
limited capacity. However, there
is no rule that U G M s must be
h e l d i n the G r e a t H a l l — o n e
could apparently be held in the
Ladies' Toilets in Beit H a l l . Y o u
could throw some good parties
that way.
