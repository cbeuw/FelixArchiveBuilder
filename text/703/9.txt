Armchair
Perverts
Apparently, it is a fact that
the average male thinks about
the act of sexual intercourse,
or a related subject, at least
once every fifteen minutes, if
not more frequently; the
author of this essay would
certainly vouch for this piece
of information and even D H
L a w r e n c e c o m m e n t s o n
man's affliction in L a d y
Chatterly's Lover, when the
man who was knocking her off
before Mellors, expresses his
resentment of the absurd and
degrading charade that is
inflicted upon himself by his
instincts. Moreover, I would
point out that the frequency is
seasonally dependant too, the
summer period seeing a
marked increase in this
parameter (comparable only
to the effect obtained by
s t u f f i n g o n e ' s self with
oysters) principally because
of the weather bringing o:;":
mini-skirts, hot-pants and tf .
like.
It is also at this time of th
year that one is presented wit
the matter of examinations
w h i c h are c o n s e q u e n t l y
difficult to work for, owning tc
r e a s o n s c o n c e r n i n g t h e
above, or, more precisely, it is
a case of:
'Please help me Mr Student
Counseller, or whatever your
name is, you can give me
advise that concerns coping
with examination stress,
depression and all of that but
this does not resolve the
sexual frustration that I am
experiencing and which is
dissolving my concentration: I
mean, one minute I am
pondering Maxwell's equation
and the next, my attention is
diverted to some creature who
has just walked past or
c r o s s e d h e r l e g s . T h e
situation is desperate, I will
not fail my examinations
because I lack intelligence but
because I've spent all my time
in the library bog abusing
myself.'
Therefore, may I recom-
mend the Festival of Erotica at
the Raymond Revue Bar, to
those who feel these same
tendencies that have just been
defined. For Â£10 (there are no
student discounts, so don't
bother asking) one experi-
ences one hour and twenty
minutes of, as the advertise-
ments describe it, Erotic
Entertainment w h i c h is
broken up into about fourteen
acts; the adverts also mention
full air-conditioning, I wonder
why? The performances start
at 7.00, 9.00 and 11.00pm but
w h e t h e r t h e y b e c o m e
chronologically seedier, I
don't know.
It is genuine 'executive clif
material, or more explicitly it
is tasteful, soft pornography.
The performers are except-
ionally pretty and there are no
s o r d i d d e t a i l s s u c h a s
nicotine-stained nipples, nor
are there any flabby girls at
whom one has to take a
second glance in order to
determine which crease is the
one of interest. There are also
no rip-offs, such as hostesses
who politely insist that you
p u r c h a s e an exorbitantly
expensive bottle of diluted
Champagne or face askirmish
with the bouncers; in fact it
was a compromise between
the two: an effeminate wimp
who realised that he could
n e v e r a c h i e v e e i t h e r ,
c o n t e n t e d h i m s e l f b y
directing people to their seats.
It w a s noticeable that
amongst the audience, there
was a high proportion of
orientals, w h i c h perhaps
reinforces the earlier point
that controlling one's sexual
urges is related to efficiency at
working: that is, these people,
who are reknowned for their
mental stamina, release their
tensions in one short burst (or
several rapid and successive
ones, to be pendantic).
There is actually quite an art
to coming in one's pants,
since there is the initial
problem of overcoming the
ludicrously of the blatant
phallic symbolism employed
in the show to be able to
arouse oneself; also the seats
are so confined that there is
not enough room to adminis-
ter even a discreet tickle. O n e
guesses from the liberal usage
of t h e s l e d g e - h a m m e r
metaphores, such as strip-
teaze on motorbikes that
represent throbbing machin-
ery pounding in between the
girls legs, that the designer
a n d c h o r e o g r a p h e r a r e
pundits of Desmond Morris.
The most unsubtle act was
the 'love-bomb', which is a
scene depicting a beautiful
girl w r i t h i n g r y t h m i c a l l y
backwards and forwards on
top of a huge SS-20 shaped
object, w h o s e front e n d
glowed red when caressed by
the aforementioned girl and,
when a lever is thrown,
abruptly a n d u n s m o o t h l y
adopts a new angle of
e l e v a t i o n w h i c h a l m o s t
causes the girl to be thrown
off her mount.
Rather surprisingly there
were no acts that incorpor-
ated nurses or schoolgirls; fair
enough, so these ideas have
yellowed, however I would
suggest that these ideas
ought to be used in the
introduction to provide a
concept that the punters can
relate to before progressing to
more complicated ideas. A
spread eagled girl in the
middle of a large cream cake
was too great a step in the
realms of sexual fantasy and a
gradual a p p r o a c h s h o u l d
have been adopted which
would have made the show
more plausable and thus
facilitated arousal.
Returning to the topic of
'coming in one's pants' and
having assumed that one now
has an erection, the moment
at which one leaves the
auditorium and rushes to the
lavatory, something that for
some occurred frequently,
has to be chosen. One can
always tell the amateur by the
way he runs out, almost
doubled up, hands on groin
and grunting, whereas the
person of greater experience
strolls leisurely across the
front of the stage towards the
door at the same time that a
performer, whom he casually
observes on p a s s i n g , is
prostrate in front of him.
In one of A n n a Ford's
recently published articles in
the Sunday Telegraph that
promoted her new book about
men, she claimed that women
had the converse reaction to
the male's serious hand in
pocket approach. From my
experience, I must disagree:
the attitude is certainly
different from that of the
man's which I believe that
show has correctly described,
however, I found the females's
j o c u l a r a p p r o a c h n o n -
existent and a bored one in its
place; perhaps this is not
surprising in the light of her
dubious claim that 60% of
males have external marital
affairs. It was almost as if their
husbands had forced them
along, expecting them to
memorize the varous acts so
as they can be re-enacted at
home; although it is uncertain
whether swinging from a
ceiling light without disturb-
ing the neighbours or causing
multiple back injuries is
feasible.
For those without wives, the
program proudly advertises
the video in order that one
may relieve the evening in the
comfort of one's own home;
this is euphemistically a way
of saying that you can sit in
f r o n t of t h e t e l e v i s i o n
masturbating which would be
impossible to do at the show
without being arrested for
gross indecency in a pubic
place.
In retrospect, the females'
ennui was not unexpected
since there was only one male
performer whose G-String
remained on throughtout,
although he did swing about
on a rope, thrusting his pelvis
into the audience, which I
guess is moderately stimulat-
ing for those interested in this
sort of thing. Perhaps this
preservation of humility is a
result of the laws regulating
pornography: it is permissible
to show explicity scenes of
cunnilingus however, it is not
to show an erect penis;
p o r n o g r a p h i c videos will
s o m e t i m e s f e a t u r e l o v e
s e s s i o n s w h i c h s h o w a
woman 'jacking off a man
with a limp one, which I guess
suggest that either the actor
has remarkable self-control or
that he has masturbated
several times before hand to
obtain this effect. The latter is
more plausible as this would
explain why, to a large extent,
blacks are employed for this:
not because of the belief that
the n e g r o i d m e m b e r is
superior to the whiteman's
couterpart but because the
bruising of the genitals is less
obvious.
The final scene involved all
the female performers in a
naked state (but of course)
and square-bashing. I admit
that this was my favourite act
because it was the most
tasteful, least pretentious and
demonstrated the beauty of
the female form.
'Bullshit, you're just a
pervert', y o u , the reader,
reply.
