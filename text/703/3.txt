Hours of fun
at Rag Fete
THE TENTH ANNUAL rag
fete will take place on the
Queen's Lawn tomorrow. It
will be opened at 2.00pm by
Lady Flowers but the bar will
be open from just after midday.
Main attraction will be the
Queen's Tower which is open to
climb for a spectacular view of
London. Clubs taking part
include Debsoc with 'Is this the
Argument R o o m ? ' , the
Orchestra and Wargames. The
Rag Committee will be running a
jumble sale—selling jumble
ranging from loads of old books
to an antique record player. If
you ignored the previous notices
and have left something in
Linstead basement for a couple
of years, this will be the chance to
buy it back—we may even offer
you a discount!
Other attractions include
Popcorn, maggot racing, raft
race, human slot machines,
strawberries and cream, hit
squad, ducking stool and chaps
burgers, Pedal Cars, Egg-
throwing, Darts, Bo and Jez, an
unridable horse, dodgems, peep
show and twat the rat. Along
with at least most of the above
and probably a whole lot more
Carl Burgess will be having his
head shaved (assuming £300 in
sponsorship is raised) and
Maribel will be dragging people
down into the mud.
To finish the afternoon off
Joint Rag Committee will take
place somewhere round the
Queens's Tower at 6.30pm with
elections of next year's officers
and the choice of charities.
In the evening, if you are very
lucky you may even find some
people down in the bar. So have a
good time and bring plenty of
money.
Oh, Sir Peter
SIR PETER Swinnerton-Dyer, Chairman of the University
Grants Committee, has indicated that he isn't willing to be
considered for the post of Rector of IC.
This was revealed after an erroneous report in the Times Higher
Educational Supplement saying that he had turned down a firm offer
of the job.
According to THES Sir Peter described the Rectorship at IC as 'the
single most important job in the university system'.
The post of Rector falls vacant in September, when Lord Flowers
becomes Vice-Chancellor.
Be warned
A NEW FILING system is to be introduced in the Union Office
next Friday.
It involves heavy use of the waste paper basket which will take care of
the piles of uncollected letters now lying in the Club and Society pigeon
holes. The new system will ensure that representatives of all Clubs and
Societies check their pigeon holes at least three times a week. Anyone
failing to do this will have Union Receptionist Kathy to face.
The system becomes operational next week, when all pigeon holes
will be emptied—so be warned. Kathy is also'threatening to rip up the
Union Message book unless the response to collect messages is better.
