THERE WILL BE a chance for
staff and students to bid the
Rector farewell at an informal
gathering on Wednesday 19 June
between 5.00pm and 7.00pm.
Beer and bangers will be
provided in the main Dining
Hall, Sherfield and, weather
permitting, on the Queen's
Lawn. Everyone is welcome to
attend.
Rent rise
THE FINAL DECISION on
rent inceases in student Halls and
Houses has been deferred until
next month when the level of next
year's grant will be announced.
The College is seeking an
increase which is expected to be
more than the grant increase.
Appealing
procedure
A NEW APPEALS procedure is
to be introduced for students
who are disciplined by Hall or
House wardens. At present any
appeal can only be referred to the
College Disciplinary Appeals
Committee. This body was
thought to be too high-powered
and so the first line of appeal will
be to a new Residence Tribunal,
which will be made up of the
deputy chairman of the student
Residence Committee, a Hall and
a House Warden and the
President and Hon Sec of IC
Union. The tribunal can also be
used if wardens are unsure about
whether or not a fine should be
imposed.
Late rent
surcharge
IN FUTURE a surcharge of £15
will be made to Hall residents
who fail to pay their rent within
two weeks of receiving the bill.
Many people don't bother paying
until the end of term in order to
gain interest on the money, or in
some cases to spend it. This
surcharge may be waived if a
valid reason for default is given
to the Student Services Officer.
Rooms
SINGLE AND SHARED rooms
are available in College
accommodation for immediate
occupation until the end of term.
Contact Leslie in the Student
Services Office.
