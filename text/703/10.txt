This is Tom Stoppard's classic play about philosophy and its
absurd relation with the real world. Dorothy, (Felicity Kendal)
failed vaudeville star, throws a party, whilst her husband,
George (Paul Eddington) desperately trying to finish his
symposium on the existance of G o d . The festivities are abruptly
halted when one guest, Duncan McFee is shot dead. Left with a
dead lecturer in her room, Dotty begins to lose her grip, whilst
George, quite unaware that anything is amiss, is unable to offer
any help or understanding. Her only succour is Archie, Vice
President of the University, who neatly disposes of the body and
side-steps the ensuing police investigation.
It is difficult to pin down what makes this play so successful.
As an established play perhaps it is ideally suited to the West
End, because so much of its meaning is contained in the text,
requiring little expressive acting from its cast. This is
unfortunately true of Paul Eddington, whose long
philosophical monologues lose much meaning in their delivery.
Felicity Kendal is both passionate and provocative, and is quite
accustomed to Stoppard's work, having worked with Peter
Wood (director) both on this and his play, The Real Thing. Most
spectacular of all, however are the professors of philosophy, the
jumpers, whose spectacular acrobatics conclude this farce in
excellent cabaret. An excellent play. Why can't the West End be
like this all the time?
JAZZ
Shcpp
I arrived late. Obviously. It
was only eight o'clock but
already it was standing room
only. A man in a pork-pie hat
and pinstripe suit was making
j o k e s o n s t a g e to an
appreciative audience. 'Turn
up the microphone, I feel like
Mick Jagger. I look a bit like
him, don't I?' This was Archie
Shepp, a man in his fifties, but
still in excellent s h a p e ,
drinking shorts and singing
blues to a roaring audience. It
was a side of Sfjepp that I had
never seen befo're. It is easy to
dispel those early l.p.'s (The
Magic Of Ju-Ju and Four For
Trane) as art for arts sake,
jumpin g on the already
unsteady bandwagon o1
the
times—but here was living
proof that a g o o d m a n
matures with age. Playing a lot
of m a i n s t r e a m t h e m e s
(Charlie Parker early Coltrane
and Eubie Blake ballads),
Shepp quite often changes
tempo, (as in The Girl From
Ipanema; Latin-American to
4:4 time), laying down riffs,
sometime diffidently, often at
a breakneck pace. He was
obviously dissatisfied with the
amplification in the house.
After a furious turn, and
amidst cheers and applause,
he reached down and fished
out a large m i c r o p h o n e
concealed deep inside his
saxophone.
If his jazz has become more
palatable, it is no less
meaningful than that work of a
decade ago, but it is more
direct. Shepp's jazz-poetry,
spoken and sung over a loose
r h y t h m i c b a c k i n g ( b y
drummer Charlie Chan Jr)
conveys the message that
once his horn would have
taken up. Poetry is nothing
new to jazz, but British
audiences have heard little in
recent years. Now, the return
of Jalal of The Last Poets ,
( a p p e a r i n g o n t h e new
Working Week I.p.). hopes to
bring this expressive form
back. Shepp himself is still
touring Britain, (he plays at
The Forum, Kentish Town on
May 16). To miss him this
time, is to miss one of the most
versatile men in jazz at the
moment.
CINEMA
Birdy
Did you ever see One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest? Well
the new film Birdy is the same
sort of formula; a lunatic, you
think, a n d there's s o m e
Vietnam war thrown in there
too somehow. None the less a
good film with some very
funny sequences and a well
acted and portrayed friend-
ship between Birdy and his
boyhood chum AI, played by
Matthew Modine and Nicolas
Cage. Lighting and music
gives a similar atmosphere to
m a n y of A l a n P a r k e r ' s
previous films.
Yes, the man who brought
you Midnight Express and
The Wall, Alan Parker sat in
front of me for the interview.
Seeing his grey hair and big
h e a d e d s m i l e left y o u
wondering how this could
realy be the man who ruined
the Turkish tourist trade. The
interview is short and he has
little to say.
He is keen to talk about the
new film and the new flying
cameras used for the first
time, with little success. He
crashed most ofthem. He says
he likes the c o m m e r c i a l
aspect of the film—American
money—as it helps him to get
his film, and what he has to
say, to the largest audience.
Frankly he has said very little
in the film, what there is is
mainly the author's work,
William Wharton.
He mentions quickly, with
nostalga, how he started his
career walking up and down
Wardour Street with film
scripts under his arms. That
was twenty years ago. Since
then he has shot commercials
and was responsible for the
film Fame.
D e s p i t e h i m a n d t h e
a n n o y i n g b a c k g r o u n d
knowledge I enjoyed the film.
The book, I think, explains the
schizophrenia which is left to
the imagination in the film.
You simply have to remember
that he really wants to make
love to the birds, rather than
any high-school girl.
SINGLES
Toyah: Don't Fall In Love
Now recording for C B S , this
new single was meant to
herald a new start for Toyah.
Unfortunately, despite the
hype that has bought it a chart
place, the music and lyrics are
equally uninspiring. Boring.
Philip Bailey: Walking On The
Chinese Wall
Title track from his album,
this suffers from the same Phil
Colins percussion production
and repetitive melodies as the
other tracks. Easy Lover was a
brilliant single (even if I, like
most others, am now bored to
death with it) but this doesn't
come close to it.
Claire Hamill: If You'd Only
Talk To Me
N o w s u p p o r t i n t g R i c k
Wakeman on tour, Claire has
had more experience of the
true soul scene (instead of the
plastic disco imitations) than
most others. Despite the
Lindisfarne voice, and Stuart
Coleman (Of Shaky fame)
production, a marvellously
lilting tune.
Bangles: Going To Liverpool
The all new, all female,
latest Bananarama imitators
have yet another all new, all
female, Banarama imitation
—and a pretty poor one at
that. Gerry and The Pace-
makers meets Abba on vinyl.
Sugar Sugar: Bouncing Up
The thing I most dislike
about this single is that it's not
a full seven inches wide and so
it f—ks up my stylus. Mind you
the music doesn't do much to
ease that initial antipathy.
Why is pop music so bland
these days.?
