NEWS FEATURE:
IT IS USUAL to associate
Portobello Road with its
weekend street antique market,
it is however a misconception
to believe that this is its only
attribute, the fruit and
vegetable market being the
obvious example that dispels
this notion. This recalls the
cherished memory of a
disgruntled American tourist
who arrived one weekday to be
confronted with the sight of
stall after stall of perishables
but there again, what does one
expect from these overtly dense
Trans-Atlantic types, other
than their usual obnoxious
habits, such as their pseudo
laughter that has as much
feeling as a faked orgasm and
their insipid nature, which was
epitomised by one who
declared to his wife on their
departure from the Stratford
Theatre ten minutes after the
play had begun,
'Well Millie, ya can now truly
say that ya've seen Shake-
speare.'
However, before this article
declines into descriptions of
Americans and vegetables, which
are actually quite difficult to
differentiate between, I will
describe the features of
Portobello that students tend to
have a greater affinity towards.
The stallholders' bawdy and
abrasive proclamation of today's
prices and 'specials' contrast with
the tactful approaches to passers
by made by the furtive characters
who stand on street corners and
who offer v a r i o u s i l l i c i t
substances at separation of an
inch between noses.
From heresay, 'dope' may also
be obtained from the pub, which
is located on the corner of
Ladbroke Grove and Blenheim
Crescent a side-street off of
Portobello; associates have been
propositioned six times within an
hour in this pub. Apart from its
reputation for live music, it is
also rumoured to be under
continual surveillance by the
police who frequently subject
persons leaving the premises,
who they suspect of carrying
drugs, to a body search; , I
therefore advise that readers,
who are unfortunate enough to
have a squint, to study their
copies of But Were Afraid To
Ask before wandering around
this neighbourhood.

Situated just off of Portobello,
along Talbot Road and opposite
one of those underground
lavatories, there is the Rough
Trade Record Shop; it deals
exclusively in records that are
released on independent labels
and consequently a vast
proportion of the stock has been
recorded by groups with
profound and radical names such
as 'Fellatio in Smegma'. Also, for
those who consider buying so-
called 'commercial' music as
being materialistic and thus
tantamount to supporting
capitalism and the music press of
being blatently exploited by the
large record concerns, this shop
also stocks a large supply of
Fanzines that will nurture your
thoughts still further. Invariably
they consist of d r e a d f u l
interviews with the local bands,
that not only fail to demonstrate
any attempt at criticism but
provide the groups with the
opportunity of self-adulation,
and to spout out their
contradictory politics. Also they
include self-opinionated verbose
articles by the editor, who revels
in puerile resentment and a wit,
that fails to compare with second
rate, pre-sixth form humour.
The Basement shop is located
underneath Rough Trade and is
thought to be an extension of the
underground conveniences; it
supplies the peripherals that any
self-respecting alternative person
might require, for example,
earrings made from IUDs.
Likewise, the other clothes shops
on Portobello tend to provide for
the Kensington Market Set,
examples of which being the
Leather Rat and the Cage.
Those who wish to maintain
the students' reputation for being
obnoxious might like to try
driving a car down the road on a
busy market day, say Saturday,
with liberal usage of the horn.
Those without a car, who still
wish to be obnoxious in some
other way, will find that
Ladbroke Grove is the closest
tube station, although Notting
Hill Gate is also in close
proximity. Sightseers are warned
against the abundance of
defecation left by dogs.
*Didyou know... that Portobello is
a small port in Panama, on the
Carribean northeast of Colon.
