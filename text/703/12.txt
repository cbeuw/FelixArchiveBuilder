CRICKET
S u m m e r game
Second XI
Last Wednesday, as foretold in
FELIX, the IC Second XI cricket
team set forth for Harlington
armed with only eleven men(?).
A bad start 15 runs for 2 wickets
was rescued by skipper Gareth
Fish and freshman Ian Morgan.
Fish played on before lunch for
47 with IC 100 for 6 against
Surrey. During lunch the rest of
the team arrived and afterwards
took us to 147 all out. Surrey
were 18 for 2 then 39 for 3. Ten
dropped catches and some very
dubious umpiring from the
Surrey camp allowed them to
score the 148 required from only
36 overs. Next week is the
crunch against the favourites
Reading.
Result: Surrey bt IC 2nd XI by
6 wickets, their first UAU win for
seven years.
UG V^tory
A fine match this was, played
between two teams of RCS
Gentlemen, during which much
new talent was displayed (not
always for cricket).
The game commenced at
2.13pm precisely on time, the
UGs having won the toss and
electing to bat.
An excellent innings produced
three 50s, with Mike Jordan
scoring 67, Ian Morgan with 62
and Dave Layland (captain) an
unbeaten 50. The PGs fought
back some extent Robin
Graham taking three wickets in
his short spell of spin bowling.
Eventually, the UGs declared
at 214 for 8, and both teams, with
spectators, proceeded to devour
the teas they had carted along.
The PGs started soundly but
were seen under pressure from
the fast opening attack of Dave
Shipley and Phil Rawstron. One
over by the captain led to a very
close run out, followed by the
wild (if not wide) antics of a
certain A T Belk. Mike Jordan
then proved himself a very able
bowler with figures of two for two
resulting in the final defeat of the
PGs on 78 all out.
Many thanks to everyone who
turned up—I hope they enjoyed
themselves, and thanks
especially to Dave and Robin for
their captaincies.
Ps We challenge the Maths
UGs—Just name a date Roy!
