Door
fiasco
T H E D O O R S to Selkirk H a l l
are to be replaced, it has been
decided by Student Residence
Committee.
The existing set of two double
doors is to be replaced by two
single doors of twice the width.
At present it is possible to
render the double door locks
useless by unbolting the doors
from the inside.
The decision to carry out the
replacement comes less than a
week after FELIX drew attention
to the problem.
Phones
fiasco
A F A U L T I N the College
telephone exchange this week
allowed students to make
national and international calls
from the Southside staircase
telephones—free of charge.
Students made calls, thought
to have cost thousands of
pounds, to the United States of
America, Australasia and the Far
East, before the fault was
discovered.
The Southside exchange was
then disconnected, until British
Telecom engineers could trace
the error in the exchange
program. It was re-connected
soon after BT engineers left, but
almost immediately started to
allow free calls again.
As a consequence of the
Southside fault, all College
telephones have been able to
make national and international
calls, 24-hours a day, by routing
such calls through the Southside
exchange. It is not clear, though,
if calls so routed will appear on
the monthly telephone bill.
Jez romps home
Finance
fiasco
T H E U N I O N Finance Committee met yesterday to decide how to
distribute a £28,000 'cut' to the Union subvention for next year.
The claim made to College for next year was considerably
higher then this year's subvention, while the University system is
being required to suffer a 2 % reduction in funding, in real terms.
It is expected that the Finance Committee will adopt a policy of
'selective misery' rather than 'equal misery' across the board,
that is they will make highly selective cuts in the funding for
certain clubs, or certain types of expenditure for groups or clubs.
Tour grants
slashed
U F C latest: Thursday 5.30pm U F C have voted to abolish club
tour grants, and sports team members will have to bear a higher
proportion of travel costs. A total of £800 is to be removed from
the C C U budgets. Further cuts may still be necessary.
Fire alarm
fiasco
R C S fire engine Jez romped home to a stunning third place in the
London to Brighton Commercial Vehicle run last Sunday.
Hordes of supporters from R C S travelled down to Brighton to
cheer on their motorized mascot.
L I N S T E A D H A L L W I L L be
without a fire alarm until next
week, while the system is
modified.
Two emergency hand sirens
have been left at the messenger's
desk but until yesterday residents
were only told that the alarm was
not working, with no mention of
what to do when the siren
sounded. Linstead warden, Dr
Clarke has now added that there
is an emergency fire alarm and
residents discovering a fire
should ring the messenger.
College Fire Officers, Bob
Foggon said the emergency
sirens were 'noisy enough to
wake the whole of South Ken'.
