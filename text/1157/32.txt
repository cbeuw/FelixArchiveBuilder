Bo Goes to Brighton '99
At the crack o f d a w n the intrepid
two, Paul a n d M a r k , g o t o u t o f b e d
a n d h e a d e d f o r the B o ' [short f o r
B o a n g e r e s , City & G u i l d s C o l l e g e
U n i o n ' s m o t o r i s e d m a s c o t ]
g a r a g e . Last S u n d a y w a s t h e
b i g g e s t d a y of B o ' s year, t h e
Brighton r u n .
A l o n g with five h u n d r e d other
veteran cars, B o ' h e a d e d t o H y d e
Park a n d the starting line. Paul
knew he h a d forgotten s o m e t h i n g
until a silver c a r s u d d e n l y p u l l e d u p
in front o f h i m . O u t j u m p e d Profes-
sor Briscoe, the D e a n o f C & G . N o
w o n d e r B o ' w a s g o i n g s o well -
w e ' d forgotten the passenger.
Eight o ' c l o c k w a s B o ' s starting
time a n d he set off f r o m t h e start
line d o i n g his o w n i m p r e s s i o n of
nine t h r e e - l e g g e d horses in a n
attempt to catch u p with C l e m , the
R S M m a s c o t . Unfortunately in the
twenty-five years between the c o n -
struction of the t w o m a s c o t s , they
h a d learnt h o w t o m a k e engines -
so B o ' h a d n o c h a n c e .
I believe the D e a n w o u l d like
to say the journey w a s uneventful.
W h a t he d i d say is h e w a s
impressed with B o ' s r o a d h o l d i n g .
Unfortunately Paul m a d e full use of
his pilot like reactions a n d very lit-
tle use of the brakes. H e is yet to
u n d e r s t a n d that ninety-seven year
o l d cars a r e not m e a n t t o o u t
a c c e l e r a t e a n d overtake m o d e r n
vehicles.
After a r e m a r k a b l y s m o o t h trip,
B o ' arrived in Brighton to b e greet-
ed by a B o o m a l a k a . This year a l l
the m o t o r i z e d m a s c o t s m a d e it t o
Brighton a n d the R S M even joined
C & G f o r dinner. C o p i o u s q u a n t i -
ties of w i n e w e r e d r u n k , especially
by M i k e the Derrick rider. T h e sto-
ries of his h a n g o v e r will b e l e g -
endary.
T h a n k s s h o u l d b e extended to
Paul t h e B o ' driver a n d M i k e the
Derrick rider f o r a l ! their w o r k in
