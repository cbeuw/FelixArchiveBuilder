What's up IC! We're g o n n a run through the latest news a n d have a quick
glance at the singles that are doing it, but first up I'm g o n n a have a serious
m o a n about the state of the U K scene.
The problem with the U K scene is that there are no problems with the U K
scene, it's really performing at the minute. S o m e of the tunes that are being
released are actually g o o d e n o u g h to blow away the so-called originators
of R&B, the Americans. The British stuff that's being released has a vibe a n d
a gloss that is as g o o d as anything they could bring out, but then why is
British R&B still l o o k e d at in a negative way. So many people refuse to
believe that Beverly Knight's a l b u m could stand on the same level as a Mary
J a l b u m ; I'm sorry but it c a n . In fact the thing's got more bounce than Mary's
by a g o o d mile. S o what's the problem? People are h o o k e d up o n the a
belief that the phattest stuff c a n only c o m e from the States... well people
better recognise, U K R&B is moving up on the right side a n d we all better
c o m e correct.
The Spice Girls have m a d e breaking up the latest thing to d o , following o n
from them a n d the so-called disintegration of Blackstreet, we have A n o t h -
er Level. It seems that o n e of the boys thinks he'll d o better on his o w n a n d
is ready to hit the road. It's been confirmed that W a y n e , the black guy, you
know, the o n e w h o c a n sing, is g o n n a be breaking up with his buddies a n d
d o his o w n thang. He's g o n n a finish off all his duties with Another Level with
their current hit "Bombdiggy" before embarking o n what he hopes is going
to be a fruitful solo career. The rest of the boys gotta be hoping he fucks
up, but s o m e h o w I doubt it, because he's already got the master d o n p r o -
ducer lined up to start work o n his a l b u m . . . no not fucking Puff D a d d y . . .
the Darkchild Rodney Jerkins is supposedly willing to d o production duties
for Wayne.
After the B o b Marley duet with the multi-talented Miss Hill it seems o n e of
the biggest stars of rap is g o n n a be making his presence felt from beyond
the grave. Biggie's back! The m a n is weighing in with another post death
a l b u m . Like Tupac it seems that there is no limit to the records that can be
pulled out of the b a g , not that that's a b a d thing. In the past, I've gone o n
about the number o n guests that turn up o n people's albums, well the new
Biggie a l b u m , "Born A g a i n " , has got more big name stars than the Holly-
w o o d . Puff Daddy, Li!1
K i m , 2Pac, Busta Rhymes, S n o o p D o g g , M o b b D e e p ,
E m i n e m , M e t h o d M a n , R e d m a n , Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliot, Ice C u b e , DJ
Premier, Clark Kent a n d anyone else you can think of, they're all there. The
first single "Dead W r o n g " has already been doing the rounds o n import.

Will Smith
(Columbia)
The m a n in black is back with this e g o m a n i -
acally titled new a l b u m . This follow up to Big
Willie Style is a collection of funk a n d 80's
groove-inspired tunes that are guaranteed to
pack the d a n c e floor (though not all the
tracks c a n d o this). O n e thing that c o m e s
d e a r is the definite o l d skool flava to the
whole a l b u m . Tracks o n this a l b u m feature
quite a few guys: K-Ci, Lit1
K i m , Slick Rick,
K o o l M o D e e , Dru Hill, his wife J a d a Pinkett
Smith a n d even the first lady of the ruff
ryders, Eve. Jazzie Jeff is back with the
scratching he is able to d o well. (Half of track
8 is Jazzie ripping it u p with s o m e d o p e
scratching).
The first couple of tracks are your party jams
(the ones meant to pack the floor). From the
first single Will 2K currently o n general
release n o w with a s l a m m i n g video, to the
Latino La Fiesta (everyone is g o i n g Spanish),
these songs will keep you moving to the beat.
Afro Angel slows things d o w n just a little with
J a d a laying d o w n s o m e s p o k e n word. The
real ' o l d s k o o l ' tracks are next, casting your
mind back in time to when Slick Rick a n d Biz
M a r k i e were at the t o p of the g a m e . A n inter-
esting track o n this a l b u m is Potnas where M r
Smith experiments with D M X of the ruff
ryders' flow. H e does okay but he should stick
to what he has 'perfected1
.
O v e r a l l , Willennium is average, without as
many jams as Big Willie Style but an O K
a l b u m with a variety of tracks using different
styles. The main g r u m b l e is that s o m e w o u l d
argue Will's flow as being t o o c o m m e r c i a l
a n d downright whack. That m a y be true but
you can't stop this guy stacking chips with his
flow so don't playa hate.
