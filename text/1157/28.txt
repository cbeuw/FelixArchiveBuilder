H o u s t o n , we have a p r o b -
lem! O r rather several p r o b -
lems, which left this play
drifting s o m e w h a t forlornly
in s p a c e . A l l t w o of us in the
a u d i e n c e w e r e t o l d t h e
wacky story of a Kentish
Town caterer w h o believed
that his m o t h e r w a s a n
astronaut. T h e play e n d e d
to the strains of Lucy In T h e
Sky With D i a m o n d s , w h i c h I
think just a b o u t s u m m e d u p
this surreal experience.
G i v e n the constraints of this
tiny theatre, the two-person
cast (Anthony Best a n d
Denise Lane) d i d w h a t they
c o u l d . M r Best d i d n o t
always d o his best, o n c e f o r -
getting his lines rather
n o t i c e a b l y a n d n e e d i n g
three l o u d prompts. M s Lane
a l s o suffered f r o m First
Night Nerves a n d it c o n -
cerns m e that professional
actors s h o u l d be s o a m a -
teurish, especially w h e n the
punters a r e p a y i n g g o o d
money.
I find it hard to s l a m this play
(I feel sorry f o r them). But if
you w a n t to g o , I'd hurry,
b e c a u s e I suspect this per-
f o r m a n c e will be pulled l o n g
before the e n d of its s c h e d -
uled s e a s o n .

T h e fringe s c e n e . It's m a d e u p of a n u m b e r
of s i d e s ; w e h a v e the writers w h o strive to
create the truly o r i g i n a l - actors w h o try a n d
b r e a t h life into the n e w scripts - a n d critics
w h o s l a g off both the others f o r b e i n g c r a p .
Is there a n y w a y o u t of this p a r a d o x . N o p e .
Fo r every g r e a t play there a r e t h o u s a n d s of
r u b b i s h o n e s - there h a s to b e . Yet without
the fringe s c e n e (which a l l o w s e x p e r i m e n t a l
theatre to d e v e l o p ) w e w o u l d ne v er h a v e
the truly great.
M o s t of the stuff o n at t h e fringe is b a d . But
this d o e s not m e a n it is worthless. For
s o m e t h i n g to be o r i g i n a l it must take a risk
- a n d that risk is that it will e n d u p b e i n g
c r a p .
W e all r e m e m b e r S h a k e s p e a r e , but there
w e r e h u n d r e d s of playwrites a r o u n d at the
t i m e ; most w e r e infinitely f o r g e t t a b l e , but
S h a k e s p e a r e w o u l d neve r h a v e d e v e l o p e d
w i t h o u t actors willing to act a n d theatres in
n e e d of s h o w s .
N e w o r i g i n a l theatre is very rare a n d - to
t o p it off - w h e n it d o e s c o m e a l o n g , s o c i -
ety d i s m i s s e s it as worthless as it is not
r e a d y yet. But this is the only w a y it c a n be
- there n e e d s to be a large a n d vibrant
fringe s c e n e full off c r a p w h i c h the great
will t r a n s c e n d . A n d yes w e even n e e d the
critics t r a s h i n g every thing they d o n ' t u n d e r -
s t a n d a n d h a i l i n g s o m e t h i n g as a m a s t e r -
p i e c e every fortnight o r s o .
Let a t h o u s a n d flowers b l o o m , but a c c e p t
most of t h e m will be ugly.
