Flanker 2.0 (PC)
Flight simulations are usually divided into two types
- the mindless, a r c a d e style affairs a n d the type that
comes with a m a n u a l four hundred pages long
requiring a degree in aeronautics a n d a private
pilots license to fly.
Flanker 2 is supposed to fill the void between these
two types - even without the m a n u a l I was in the air
a n d shooting things d o w n well e n o u g h after a few
minutes. There are also various training missions
available in-game in which, a n d as a learning
method they are extremely effective. The Flanker of
the game's title is the S U - 2 7 , the latest, hardest
(and probably biggest) Russian fighter plane. I a m
told that because the Russian a r m e d services d o
pretty m u c h anything f o r money these days, the
developers were allowed access to all sorts of
information o n the plane that wouldn't have been
available if they'd chosen a n A m e r i c a n plane.
Whether anyone but the most dedicated flight
fanatic would notice the difference I doubt very
m u c h , however - when was the last time you actu-
ally flew an F-1 6 ?
I d o think that perhaps this realism drive might
have gone a little far though - all the cockpit
switches are labelled in Russian only, which does
nothing to enhance playability. Indeed the whole
g a m e seems to have been designed with a very
Russian military design policy in m i n d : keep it sim-
ple, build something that does the job a n d forget
the rest. W h e r e it counts (ie around target areas)
the graphics are very detailed, but elsewhere they
b e c o m e blurry a n d lack colour depth. This means
it runs extremely smoothly even o n my o l d P C ,
something many other modern flight sims don't d o .
The emphasis is very much o n the details of flying,
not o n flashy eye-candy.
Here's o n e example of the kind of mission in the
g a m e : during o n e anti-ship mission I took out the
c o m b a t air patrol from long range a n d dove in o n
the target ship. Firing two sea-skimming missiles at
it I turned for h o m e o n full afterburner, skimming
the waves at 1 3 0 0 k p h . A s I watched the missiles
streak targetwards, t w o s h i p - l a u n c h e d S A M S
d o w n e d both of t h e m , leaving m e with no
w e a p o n s a n d looking a right fool. N o w that is
detail.
If you take the time to get beyond the initial train-
ing missions, this is a big g a m e with loads of mis-
sions to play. The multiplayer section is well imple-
mented a n d entertaining, although it lacks the per-
sonal c o m b a t touch of W o r l d W a r II dogfighting
games. It is not a new b e n c h m a r k in c o m b a t flight
simulations, but it's definitely up their with the best
of them.

The most important fact a b o u t this g a m e is that it's
great fun to play. From the cutesy, squeaky cartoon
characters to the very clear graphics, everything is
enjoyable.
A 3 D platform g a m e a l o n g the lines of M a r i o 6 4 ,
Rayman 2 is definitely worth a try if you like that
sort of thing. The storyline m a y be a bit weird at
times, but then w h o really takes any notice of plots
in g a m e s anyway? Basically, you play Rayman, a
floppy-eared creature with no arms o r legs - his
feet a n d hands just float a r o u n d - a n d have to save
the world by jumping around a n d collecting things.
The g a m e eases you in gradually with a lot of easy
levels early o n . With a bit of patience you'll s o o n
get o n to the more challenging a n d fun levels. This
is certainly a big g a m e , as I've been playing for a
week n o w a n d my score is still only 8 % . It's also
rewarding, as you are always discovering new lev-
els a n d special sections, not just frustratingly walk-
ing round the same levels again a n d again l o o k -
ing for the exit
A fair bit of thought has obviously g o n e into the
level design, a n d some of the puzzles a n d tricks are
especially cunning. They are also varied, not just
the endless repeating "jump, walk, jump, shoot" of
many 3 D platform games o n the P C . The puzzles
aren't exactly brain-taxers, never g o i n g beyond the
standard 'pull the switch to o p e n the door1
kind
really, but you need pretty g o o d coordination to
get far. O n the whole the c a m e r a angles are g o o d ,
a n d you c a n always move the c a m e r a if you need
to.
The graphics are well drawn a n d detailed, a n d the
sound effects are suitably squeaky a n d cartoon
like. The music is bouncy a n d f u n , with nice little
trills when y o u d o something important. It's a little
like playing in o n e of those kids cartoons that are
on TV early Saturday m o r n i n g .
All in a l l , Rayman 2 is a n extremely well polished
g a m e . It may be a little childish, but if you treat it
as a bit of a laugh a n d just play the g a m e , it'll s o o n
draw you in a n d have you hitting the keyboard in
disgust when you miss a n easy jump a n d p o o r lit-
tle Rayman plunges to his d o o m just before you
complete the level.
