H a r d core. I a m well
a w a r e that this play w a s
not a i m e d at a wide sec-
tion of the public a n d
unless y o u a r e a middle-
a g e d h o m o s e x u a l
u n a b l e to find the b a l -
a n c e between a m o n o g -
a m o u s relationship a n d
m i d n i g h t s o d o m y with
strangers o n the heath,
then the issues of this
play will p e r h a p s s e e m a
little distant.
The play attempted to
deal with these issues
t h r o u g h the u n c e r t a i n
relationship between a n
older lover a n d a y o u n g
guy in a b o y b a n d . T h e
characters spent a l m o s t
half the time butt n a k e d
or s h a g g i n g . I respect
the actors f o r attempting
such a hard core piece
of theatre a n d the writer
for d e a l i n g with t h e
issues in such a frank
way but it never really
w o r k e d .
Basically the p r o d u c t i o n
was o u t of it's depth a n d
as a result e n d e d u p
being long periods of
b o r e d o m punctuated by
brief m o m e n t s of b u g -
gery.

If y o u d e c i d e to visit this exhibition (and y o u should), y o u will not depart with the
s a m e impression as us. That's what the Turner Prize is all a b o u t ; it c h a l l e n g e s o u r
definition of "art". Short-listed for the prize this year are four very controversial artists
- n o n e m o r e s o than Tracy Emin. H e r work is striking b e c a u s e of the wide range of
responses that it p r o v o k e s . H e r s h o w p i e c e comprises of her sick b e d , e m b r o i d e r e d
quilt (pictured a b o v e ) , m e m o r a b i l i a a n d v i d e o f o o t a g e . Is she a self-centred narcis-
sistic tart w h o boosts h e r e g o through capturing o u r sympathy? O r is she wanting
to s h a m e herself t h r o u g h laying bare her life to the j u d g e m e n t of others? D o y o u feel
s o r r o w f o r her o r c o n t e m p t ? Either way she has h a d a colourful a n d , at times, sor-
did past, which p e r h a p s she is trying to reconcile through her work, c o m i n g to terms
with the t r a u m a (particularly sexual) she describes in her childish scribbles. It's p r o b -
ably the most immediately accessible of all the work s h o w n .
J a n e a n d Louise Wilson's display also studies aspects of h u m a n nature, through
l o o k i n g at h o w experiences have b e c o m e ingrained in the fabric of two distinct l o c a -
tions; the H o o v e r d a m a n d a Las V e g a s c a s i n o . Their wall to wall cinematic display
not only recreates the a t m o s p h e r e a n d disorientation of the C a s i n o life style (with it's
w r a p - a r o u n d visuals a n d evocative s o u n d track), but it also reflects the uncertainly
a n d c h e a p n e s s of such a n existence. The d a m ' s corridors stretch away into n o t h i n g -
ness, c o m p l e m e n t i n g the c a s i n o f o o t a g e , m a k i n g y o u unsure which path o r c h a n c e
to take.
Steve M c Q u e e n a i m s to p r o d u c e a physical reaction in the viewer, this time m o r e f o r
c o m i c effect. His D e a d Pan is a recreation of a Buster Keaton sketch, with the side
of a house falling o n the artist, only for him to miraculously survive since the empty
w i n d o w f r a m e falls a r o u n d h i m . This promotes the idea of gravity creating a solid
a n d very real threat, a n d of the artist taking a risk for his trade. His work c a n be
interpreted in a n u m b e r of ways, a n d in spite of the fact that it is not immediately
a c c e s s i b l e , this m a k e s is all the m o r e rewarding.
O n the surface Steven Pippin's work seems m o r e like science than art. H e has c o n -
verted twelve w a s h i n g m a c h i n e s in to pin hole c a m e r a s , c a p a b l e of d e v e l o p i n g their
slides within the w a s h i n g cycle. These pictures a r e displayed in series a l o n g the w a l l ,
but unfortunately the c o n c e p t of h o w they were taken is m o r e exciting than what y o u
actually see - a l t h o u g h h i m w a l k i n g through the launderette in his y-fronts with a vis-
ible erection m a y be interesting to s o m e . A g o o d i d e a but the results were uninspir-
ing.
