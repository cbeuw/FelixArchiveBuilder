Rage of Mages I (PC)
R a g e of Mages II is m u c h like the original, a hybrid of
R P G a n d strategy, but there have b e e n s o m e very
w e l c o m e refinements. A s before you w a n d e r a b o u t a
Warcrafr-like m a p , fighting monsters a n d trying to
a c c o m p l i s h g o a l s . A s you w h a c k monsters, they c a n
leave b e h i n d g o l d a n d e q u i p m e n t that you c a n use to
i m p r o v e your character, plus your skills a n d hit points
as y o u fight. U p o n c o m p l e t i n g your g o a l , y o u c a n
m o v e o n to the next mission, o r h a n g a r o u n d a n d
explore the m a p fully, l o o k i n g for more monsters a n d
m o r e g o l d . Between missions, y o u stop at towns t o
trade stuff, o r hire mercenaries if you think the next
mission will require a n extra body.
W h a t is great a b o u t this g a m e is its non-linearity. You
don't have t o d o the quests in a particular order, y o u
c a n c h o o s e w h i c h quest a n d w h e n . O n the d o w n side
the g r a p h i c s a r e not very a d v a n c e d s o d o not expect
to b e w o w e d . A l s o , the character's movements a r e
quite jerky a n d slow. Saying this graphics a r e sec-
o n d a r y in these sorts of g a m e s a n d it is really the
playability a n d interaction that you're after.
ROM2 features a simple but effective battle structure,
akin to the world of WarCraft. Point a n d click to tell
your character w h a t to d o , which spell t o cast, which
monster to attack, etc. Real time g a m e p l a y forces you
to determine plans of attack before the fight, a n d
R O M 2 will keep you constantly thinking.
O n e thing which I f o u n d a n n o y i n g a b o u t this g a m e is
that it is very hard. Usually hard g a m e s m a k e for a n
interesting c h a l l e n g e but w h e n y o u keep o n dying
you lose interest. It was a case of saving every c o u p l e
of minutes for fearing of b e i n g m a s s a c r e d by certain
z o m b i e s a n d other nefarious creature.
In c o n c l u s i o n the g a m e is a nice RPG/strategy but
there is not m u c h n e w here. I, personally enjoyed it
but it d o e s have a jerky quality a n d is sometimes very
tricky. If it weren't for the likes of D i a b l o II c o m i n g o u t
s o o n I might have b o u g h t this g a m e straight off but I
think it is best to wait for it t o c o m e out in budget.
Nocturne (PC)
I can't r e m e m b e r the last time I was as disappointed in a
g a m e as I w a s with N oc tur ne. I read all the hype,
d r o o l e d over the screenshots a n d was so excited to have
a preview copy, I c o u l d hardly get the C D into the drive.
I w o u l d guess that the feeling of excitement lasted about
two minutes o n c e I started playing the g a m e itself. T h e
p r o b l e m is that it iacks that most important element in -
a decent, original, idea. This g a m e has been m a d e s o
many times before, s o m u c h better. This is the kind of
g a m e that causes me to lose faith in the industry. I m e a n ,
the guys w h o write these g a m e s must b e intelligent o r
they couldn't c o p e with the p r o g r a m m i n g . S o how c a n
no one in this big g r o u p of intelligent people spot that
what you are releasing is a pile of warmed-over repeti-
tive rubbish?
First off, a n y sense of immersion in the g a m e , vitally
important in horror g a m e s if it is g o i n g t o be scary in the
slightest, is destroyed by the infuriating fixed third person
viewpoint. The graphics may b e g o o d , but as the only
thing that actually moves is the m a i n character a n d a
few pathetic l o o k i n g walking corpses the visuals s o o n
lose their a p p e a l . The c a m e r a angles are so b a d half the
time you can't even see your character - falling to your
death over a precipice you couldn't even see because
the g a m e engine is so p o o r is not my idea of fun.
Then there is the c o m b a t . A i m i n g in third person is diffi-
cult e n o u g h , but the control system is even worse, l e a d -
ing to bizarre situations with my character standing in the
corner shooting at the g r o u n d instead of at the d o g that
was busy g n a w i n g my leg off. Personally, I think the only
reason the b a d guys are all slow moving z o m b i e s is that
shooting anything moving m u c h faster w o u l d b e i m p o s -
sible due t o the p o o r controls a n d c a m e r a angles.
Even worse, in order to play N o c t u r n e properly requires
a very high-end m a c h i n e (about a Pentiumlll-450 a n d a
decent 32-bit 3 D card). This is most definitely not the
kind of g a m e that w o u l d e n c o u r a g e m e to u p g r a d e .
A v o i d it as y o u w o u l d the w a l k i n g , disease ridden
corpse of M a g g i e Thatcher.
