Guilds Union forced to cancel again
ANDREW OFORI
The innovation of the City a n d Guilds
Union is yet to impress its students,
forcing them to scale d o w n their lat-
est venture.
C & G U intended to take a bus
load of students to Brighton o n S u n -
day 7 N o v e m b e r in support of B o 1
(the Guild's mascot) w h o w a s taking
part in the veteran c a r run. T h e
antique c a r successfully completed
the journey in 7hours. Unfortunately
with only 1 2 people showing a n y
interest in the 7 2 possible places,
C & G U was unable to justify the cost
of the c o a c h .
Despite the withdrawal of the bus
trip the Guilds had intended to take a
special guest supporter to Brighton
for the d a y - the U L U President. They
hatched a plot to kidnap a n d drive

him to the c a r run in their G u i l d s m o -

. It was decided to g o a h e a d if it
could b e done legally. They formed
an alliance With Chris C a m p b e l l , the
London Student Editor, and arrived at
M r Butt's house o n Sunday morning,
only to learn they had been set up. M r
C a m p b e l l refused to let them through
the perimeter fencing a n d then stood
by as M r Butt appeared from behind
a wall and shot at them with a Super-
soaker.
This latest flop comes soon after
the Star Wars party where only 3 5 out
of a possible 1 0 0 tickets were sold
resulting in a loss of £236. C & G U
President D i n e s h G a n e s a r a j a h
explained his intention was to try a n d
keep the students entertained during
the winter term, viewing this as a
weakness of G u i l d s in previous years.
M r G a n e s a r a j a h took the view
that risks needed to be taken in order
to find appropriate entertainment,
saying "The experimental nature of
the previous events always meant they
held the possibility of being u n p o p u -
lar to the masses, hence the minimal
expenditure."
He hopes that the combination of
a strong reputation a n d creative pro-
duction will m a k e the u p c o m i n g
C & G Fresher's Dinner a success.
The event is to b e held in Sher-
field o n Friday 1 9 N o v e m b e r at 7 p m .
Tickets a r e available at Waterstones
a n d the C C S s h o p costing £ 1 5 for
Freshers a n d £1 7 for other students.
Newton sets out plan for an NUS free future for all
SUNIL RAO
Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n is to host a
conference for i n d e p e n d e n t student
unions a n d those w h o a r e consider-
ing disaffiliating from the N a t i o n a l
U n i o n of Students, with the a i m of
setting u p a buying c o n s o r t i u m . This
w o u l d b e a n alternative t o t h e
N a t i o n a l U n i o n of Students Services
Limited (NUSSL), the N U S p u r c h a s -
ing g r o u p .
Currently, N U S S L provides a
platform to buy beer a n d other
g o o d s that student unions require at
a bulk discount. T h e sheer size of
this student market has resulted in
N U S S L reaching the m a x i m u m level
of discounting that most suppliers
c a n provide. However, a student
union c a n n o t b e a part of N U S S L
without paying a large subscription -
if I C U were to join, it w o u l d m e a n
p a y i n g a r o u n d thirty t h o u s a n d
p o u n d s annually.
N U S S L is inextricably mired in
the politics o f the N U S , a n d it is
impossible to leave the N U S without
also leaving N U S S L [as described in
Them a n d N U S in Felix 1 1 5 5 ] .
M a n y student unions that disagree
with the political stance of the N U S
are remaining with it because of
N U S S L . Tasha N e w t o n , I C U Presi-
dent, believes that the rate of disaf-
filiation will rise dramatically a s
s o o n as a local alternative that is
demonstrably as g o o d is offered.
I C U buys from a range o f s u p -
pliers including Northern Services
(annual fee £25), a consortium set
up to serve the Scottish Universities,
a n d T U C O , the C o l l e g e purchasing
g r o u p .
The conference, to be held o n 4
D e c e m b e r , will present a range of
options to the unions, including set-
ting u p a "Southern Services" g r o u p ,
or e x p a n d i n g T U C O . Both w o u l d
offer c o n s i d e r a b l e buying p o w e r for
m e m b e r s a n d b e a viable alterna-
tive to N U S S L . They w o u l d also
allow I C U access t o greater dis-
counts a n d therefore better value
g o o d s .
W h e n c o n t a c t e d , Tasha N e w t o n
c o m m e n t e d , "This is potentially
s o m e t h i n g really • exciting, but my
priority will always b e getting the
best deals for IC students".
