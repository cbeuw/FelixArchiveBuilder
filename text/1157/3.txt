Student Pugwash continued its series
of lectures with a talk given by D r
John Hassard from Imperial C o l -
lege's Physics department. The title
of the lecture w a s 'Will C l i m a t e
C h a n g e Drive N u c l e a r Prolifera-
tion?' a n d it focused o n whether
nuclear energy could provide a solu-
tion to the threat of global warming.
If C O 2 p r o d u c e d from fossil
fuels is c a u s i n g a substantial
increase in global temperature, o n e
obvious solution w o u l d be to use a n
energy source that puts out no C O 2 ,
such as nuclear. A p r o b l e m with
nuclear energy is that it produces
material that, especially w h e n
reprocessed, c a n b e used to build
nuclear w e a p o n s . This manifests
itself in n u c l e a r p r o l i f e r a t i o n ,
because nearly every country in the
world w o u l d have their own factories
p u m p i n g out material, which has u p
until n o w been the major limiting
factor in the m a k i n g of nuclear
w e a p o n s .
Dr H a s s a r d a r g u e d that if d r a -
matic changes to the climate d i d
o c c u r over a time scale of years,
then nuclear energy could b e a
short-term s o l u t i o n , halting the
increase in C O 2 levels in the atmos-
p h e r e until r e n e w a b l e energy
sources b e c o m e viable. N u c l e a r
proliferation need not result, provid-
ing the reactors are designed to
minimise the w e a p o n s grade materi-
al p r o d u c e d . N u c l e a r accountancy
c o u l d b e sufficiently reliable to
ensure that there is n o increase in
the availability of such material to
despotic regimes.
The next lecture to b e held is
'Verifying N u c l e a r Disarmament: A
Role For A W E A l d e r m a s t o n ' by Tom
M i l n e on 2 D e c e m b e r at 1 p m . If you
are interested in the implementation
of ethics in science, then c o m e

ings held every Thursday at 1 p m in
