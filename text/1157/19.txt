Beck w a s d i a g n o s e d at fourteen as
chronically u n a b l e to release a w e a k
single, a n d so far n o cure has been
f o u n d . Sexxlaws is the latest a n d
most multi-faceted of his symptoms.
B a c k i n g u p the usual fare of lyrics
catchier a n d m o r e nonsensical than /
Am The Walrus, we find that Mr.
H a n s e n ' s e x t r a o r d i n a r i l y p o l i s h e d
p r o d u c t i o n spawns the most infec-
tious d a n c i n g record of 1 9 9 9 .

M y single of the w e e k ! T h e s i m p l e
story has a t a l e n t e d M C w h o loses
the plot (Pt. 1, Don't Let Money
Change Ya), g o e s t h r o u g h hell (Pt.
2, Turmoil), a n d has to r e d i s c o v e r
his roots (Pt. 3, Redemption) Tracks

s o o o dark! E n o u g h s a i d .

Surely after just h e a r i n g

It's About Time You...
(Epic)
It's the b a n d with the
lead singer w h o thinks
she's seductive b e c a u s e
she's w e a r i n g intellectu-
al glasses. T h e f o l l o w
up to the m i n d b u r r o w -
ing Friends Forever is
t r a g i c ; it e v e n h a s

She's The One / It's Only Us
(EMI)
This is nothing but a money-spinner
f r o m the b o y wonder. N o matter
h o w g o o d She's The One is, a n d it is
truly beautiful, everyone already has
the a l b u m . S o he's l u m p e d it
together with It's Only Us, p r e s u m -
ably to be taken f r o m the third
a l b u m . A l t h o u g h it's f r o m the s a m e
t e a m as Old Before I Die a n d Let Me
Entertain You, it clearly isn't as g o o d .
The result is a p a c k a g e of two
s o n g s , the theory b e i n g two halves
m a k e a w h o l e .

Best Friend
(Arista)
W h e n a m a n with a bottom lip wor-
thy of a r a m p o n Tony Hawk's Skate-
board Challenge a n d the musical
talent of a p e a n u t m a n a g e s to
e n g a g e Jennifer Lopez, you know he
must be d o i n g something right, but
this is not it. This s o n g is all a b o u t
his f r i e n d s h i p with G o d , a n d
a l t h o u g h that's a d m i r a b l e , it's not
m u c h of a c o m p l i m e n t ; i m a g i n e h o w
a n n o y e d you'd be if your girlfriend
b o u g h t you a token of her love for
you a n d g a v e her s o m e used socks.

Pull Together
(Sony)
With a hurried verse,
the c h o r u s c o m b i n e s
the f o r m u l a of b o t h
S p i r i t u a l i z e d a n d
E m b r a c e , m a d e e p i c
a n d loud with a lot of
h a r m o n i e s . They even
m a n a g e to pull it off,
but sadly, they are lack-
ing the character a n d
individuality they n e e d
to gain credibility.
