D e s p i t e w h a t y o u h a v e p r o b a b l y h e a r d a b o u t Fight Club, this is n o t a
film a b o u t v i o l e n c e . Sorry t o t h o s e o f y o u w h o w a n t e d to s e e B r a d Pitt
get his h e a d s m a c k e d i n . W h i l e it d o e s i n v o l v e a lot o f b a r e k n u c k l e
f i g h t i n g , it is m o r e a story a b o u t o n e p e r s o n , a c t e d by E d w a r d N o r t o n ,
a n d h o w he a c c i d e n t a l l y f o u n d s a cult.
B a s e d o n t h e n o v e l by C h u c k P a l a h n i u k this film h a s b e e n a d a p t e d f o r
s c r e e n by J i m U h l s . This is his d e b u t s c r e e n p l a y a n d he h a s d o n e
extremely w e l l . D a v i d F i n c h e r d i r e c t s this film in his very distinctive
style. M o s t of y o u will k n o w h i m f r o m films s u c h as The G a m e , S e v e n ,
a n d Alien 3.
The m a i n c h a r a c t e r narrates the story f o r y o u a n d o c c a s i o n a l l y talks to
the v i e w e r in the first p e r s o n . H e tells y o u a b o u t h i m s e l f a n d his d a y t o
d a y life. A l l g o e s w e l l until h e m e e t s Tyler D u r d e n (Pitt). D u r d e n is the
sort of p e r s o n w h o is a l w a y s p o p u l a r a n d e v e r y o n e w o u l d love to b e .
H e a n d the n a r r a t o r start a fight c l u b c o m p l e t e l y by a c c i d e n t a n d , as
y o u h a v e p r o b a b l y h e a r d f r o m the film trailers, "The first rule a b o u t
Fight C l u b is n o t to talk a b o u t Fight C l u b . " S o I won't.
M a k i n g a starring a n d f a n t a s t i c a p p e a r a n c e is M e a t l o a f H e plays
Robert P a u l s o n w h o h a s h a d t e s t i c u l a r c a n c e r a n d n o w h a s b i g bitch
breasts. H e acts his part e x t r e m e l y well a n d it is w o r t h w a t c h i n g this
film just f o r h i m . A l s o starring is H e l e n B o h n a m C a r t e r , not p l a y i n g h e r
u s u a l E n g l i s h Rose c h a r a c t e r but m o r e of a l e a c h y type of p e r s o n . T h e
cast w o r k s i n c r e d i b l y well a n d it is rare to s e e s o m a n y f a m o u s p e o p l e
a c t u a l l y g i v i n g a g o o d p e r f o r m a n c e in o n e f i l m .
Fight Club is o n e o f t h o s e films that y o u think y o u u n d e r s t a n d a n d
quite enjoy. T h a t is until a b o u t t h r e e - q u a r t e r s of the w a y t h r o u g h w h e n
it s u d d e n l y c h a n g e s . T h e plot d o e s n ' t quite lose y o u as m u c h as it c o n -
fuses y o u . This is t h e type o f f i l m that t a k e s a w h i l e t o sink in a n d
leaves y o u w o n d e r i n g a b o u t v a r i o u s a s p e c t s f o r days later. It is full of
dark h u m o u r a n d there is e v e n a brief m o m e n t of i d i o c y w h e n the film
s u d d e n l y s e e m s like a m o d e r n d a y s c e n e f r o m M o n t y Python's Life of
Brian.
O k , w h a t I s a i d a b o u t v i o l e n c e isn't exactly true. T h e r e a r e fights a n d
w h e r e they o c c u r there a r e lots of f a n t a s t i c s p e c i a l effects. It d o e s get
a bit g r u e s o m e at t i m e s but at least t h e b l o o d d o e s l o o k like b l o o d .
With the recent spate of "slasher" m o v i e s , finally a b a t i n g with the release
of Scream 3 early next year, it's a refreshing surprise to see m o r e c o n -
ventional s u p e r n a t u r a l thrillers p i c k i n g u p s t e a m . The Sixth Sense is a
w e l c o m e a d d i t i o n to this g e n r e .
This m o v i e must have b e e n a n i g h t m a r e to pitch to s t u d i o executives.
Let's take a story, by a n u n p r o v e n screenwriter/director, set in a g e n r e
last m a d e p o p u l a r in the m i d 1 9 7 0 ' s , with the e m p h a s i s of the a c t i n g o n
a 9 year o l d k i d . T h e n a d d Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist, into the mix!
G r a n t e d that Willis hasn't h a d a great track r e c o r d w h e n it c o m e s to
playing a psychologist [Colour of Night anyone!) o r a c t i n g o p p o s i t e a
child (Mercury Rising), it's a surprise that this m o v i e w o r k s so well - the
studio execs must have h a d great hindsight to green-light this project.
But w e s h o u l d be thankful b e c a u s e M N i g h t S h y a m a l a n h a s b e e n a b l e
to craft a n extremely well a c t e d a n d well d e l i v e r e d thriller that m a y not
scare y o u out of your wits, but will definitely leave y o u with a sense of
u n e a s e as y o u leave the c i n e m a .
Willis plays D r M a l c o l m C r o w e , a p s y c h o l o g i s t , w h o at the start of the
m o v i e is shot by a f o r m e r patient b e f o r e the patient turns the g u n o n
himself. W e are then w h i s k e d t o w a r d s "The Next Fall" w h e r e we meet
C r o w e . H e n o w has a n e w patient, 9-year-old C o l e S e a r (Haley Joel
O s m e n t ) , w h o exhibits the s a m e p r o b l e m s as the f o r m e r patient - a n d so
C r o w e sees the ability to r e d e e m himself in the boy.
W h a t unfolds is a n e x c e p t i o n a l l y well-crafted p i e c e of m o v i e m a k i n g in
w h i c h the suspense factor is c r a n k e d right u p . But w h a t m a k e s this m o v i e
really work is the a c t i n g . W h o w o u l d h a v e t h o u g h t that Bruce Willis
c o u l d be a b l e to convey e m o t i o n s in a subtle m a n n e r without giving a
one-liner, c r a c k i n g his t r a d e m a r k smirk a n d then w h i p p i n g o u t a g u n
before all hell breaks l o o s e ? Toni C o l l e t t e , w h o plays C o l e ' s mother, is
a l s o o u t s t a n d i n g as a w o m a n w h o is trying to u n d e r s t a n d w h a t is w r o n g
with h e r s o n whilst k e e p i n g h e r family together. But the real discovery is
O s m e n t , w h o s e a c t i n g in this m o v i e is n o t h i n g short of i n c r e d i b l e - there
are a l r e a d y whispers of a n O s c a r n o m i n a t i o n f o r Best S u p p o r t i n g Actor.
He's a b l e to hold his o w n in scenes with Willis a n d it's these scenes w h i c h
p r o v i d e the b a c k b o n e of this m o v i e .
M u c h has b e e n said a b o u t this movie's b i g twist e n d i n g , a n d all I c a n
say is whatever you've h e a r d is right. T h e e n d i n g in this m o v i e b e l o n g s
o n the s a m e m a n t e l p i e c e as The Usual Suspects, a n d Seven a m o n g o t h -
ers, with the hints t o w a r d s it b e i n g p r o v i d e d all t h r o u g h o u t the m o v i e .
