It's the voice. U n i q u e , instinctu-
al, lively, but most of all it's fear-
less. M e r z ( C o n r a d Lambert)
has a wonderful array of tunes,
but instead of messing them
a r o u n d in order to m a k e it
interesting, they're innovatively
embellished to g o r g e o u s effect.
This means you're g o i n g to
hear a b u n c h of things you
don't always get f r o m your
usual p o p a l b u m . Lotus begins
with a brass b a n d picking out a
lonely tune, before c o m p u t -
erised breakbeats pick u p the
t e m p o , followed by that voice.
The gospel choir in C C C o n -
scious gives way to chunky per-
cussion, squelchy bass a n d a
keening v o c a l . A l t h o u g h these
are seemingly disparate a n d
contrasting e l e m e n t s , every
song sounds incredibly c o h e -
sive.
This a l b u m sounds s o original
a n d alive. M u s i c has recently
been finding new a n d exciting
ways to diversify a n d m e r g e ,
but never to such joyful extent
as it does here. Everything f r o m
techno, drum 'n' bass, folk, jazz,
electro, indie... (the list c o u l d
go o n forever) is a b s o r b e d a n d
fearlessly i m p l e m e n t e d to cre-
ate something unique. But best
of all, the tunes are g o o d . N o t
just g o o d , fantastic. Indeed,
there's a whole n e w world out
there. Let M e r z into your life.

R A A A A A A A A A A A A G E ! S o m e h o w , these boys are still angry after
three a l b u m s . W h i c h m a k e s m e h a p p y - as it w o u l d have b e e n ali t o o
easy f o r R a g e to sell out - b e c o m e all post rock a n d n o n - a b r a s i v e .
But they still rock.
If y o u didn't like R a g e b e f o r e , this a l b u m won't e n d e a r them to y o u in
any s p e c i a l n e w way. But if, like m e , you loved to listen to a b a n d with
a bit of integrity rather than the usual m o n e y g r a b b i n g layabouts then
this will be right u p your street. T h e track listing says it all really -
Calm A s B o m b , Voice O f The Voiceless, Born As Ghosts a n d Broken
Man b e i n g s o m e of the m o r e m e l l o w titles. But it really isn't a b o u t the
titles, it's all a b o u t the depth of real e m o t i o n that g o e s into these
s o n g s - the w a y they s m a c k you in the face a n d m a k e you think while
getting y o u m o s h i n g r o u n d the r o o m as well. I defy a n y o n e to listen
to Sleep Now In The Fire o n full v o l u m e a n d not e n d up b o u n c i n g off
the walls.
The r e a s o n they a r e still the s a m e after all these years is that the sys-
tems that they were originally protesting a g a i n s t still exists. Further, as
far as R a g e are c o n c e r n e d , in m a n y cases these systems h a v e
b e c o m e even m o r e extreme a n d unjust. W e s h o u l d be ali this angry.
But this isn't a political f o r u m , s o o n with the critique. After listening
to this a l b u m a c o u p l e of times, most U S (and US influenced) rock
b a n d s s o u n d e d hopelessly w e e d y a n d apathetic. I s u p p o s e not every-
o n e wants to be m a d e to think while r o c k i n g out, but I think it's very
refreshing to h e a r it - even if y o u don't subscribe to their stance.
The s a m e r o c k / f u n k / i n d u s t r i a l / r a p style is very m u c h in e v i d e n c e ,
a n d there's s o m e sparks of r e g g a e (yes, that's reggae), e l e c t r o n i c a
(as the yanks w o u l d term it) a n d even folky flavours t o o . O f c o u r s e
there's still plenty of grunting a n d w a i l i n g . A s voices g o , Z a c k de la
Rocha's certainly has a lot of f e e l i n g . W h i l e he rarely ' s i n g s ' , I don't
think that m a n y p e o p l e at R a g e gigs fail to u n d e r s t a n d the e m o t i o n s
i n v o l v e d in his rap/rant style of o r a t i n g .
I think the w o r l d w o u l d be a better p l a c e with a few m o r e b a n d s like
R a g e A g a i n s t the M a c h i n e . A few m o r e that question the society that
they are in - rather than singing a b o u t h o w fine M i c k y is, o r that they
are g o i n g to b l a m e everything o n the w e a t h e r m a n . M o r e of the s a m e
- but w h e n it's this great, w h o cares?
