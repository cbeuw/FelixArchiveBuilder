Nothing toifb with me?
The nature of scwKific responsibility
E
n g a g e any g r o u p of scientists o r engineers
in discussion over a n y ethical, political o r
sociological issue a n d you're sure to hear
the mantra " k n o w l e d g e f o r knowledge's
sake" repeated m o r e than o n c e . The insinuation is
that pure research is free f r o m a n y outside influ-
ences o r concerns, that it is driven by a desire to
understand, not by g l o b a l impact o r implication.
But is this true? C a n scientists a n d engineers deny
responsibility f o r their work, o r must they share
blame a n d culpability a l o n g with credit?
The most obvious (and cliched) e x a m p l e is
obviously the M a n h a t t a n Project. Years later,
many of the leading figures o n the project accept-
ed that what they d i d , what they created, c h a n g e d
the face of the world - i n d e e d it w o u l d be easy to
argue that the invention of the a t o m i c b o m b inti-
mately s h a p e d the history a n d politics of the entire
s e c o n d half of the twentieth century. Yet s o m e
w o u l d still say that what they were e n g a g e d in w a s
still a research b a s e d p r o g r a m m e (attempting to
harness a t o m i c energy f o r the first time), a n d thus
the responsibility lies not with O p p e n h e i m e r a n d
his t e a m , but rather with President Truman a n d his
military advisors, w h o authorised the d r o p p i n g of
the b o m b .
In actual fact, the M a n h a t t a n Project high-
lights the real p r o b l e m with scientific responsibili-
ty - if you see the i m p e n d i n g implications of your
research, s h o u l d y o u stop your work, despite the
(seeming) certainty that s o m e o n e else will reach
the s a m e discoveries within the next few years? In
this case, their desire to design the b o m b w a s
driven by the threat of the G e r m a n ' s constructing
one first (whether o r not there ever w a s actually
any c h a n c e of a N a z i a t o m i c b o m b is a w h o l e dif-
ferent discussion). A l t h o u g h this is a very extreme
e x a m p l e , it's still a single e x a m p l e of a m u c h
more w i d e s p r e a d ( a n d , from a m o r a l standpoint,
incredibly complex) p r o b l e m .
To use a reasonably recent e x a m p l e , if y o u
are o n the verge of discovering the terminator
g e n e f o r G M modified crops, should y o u follow
through your research. O n o n e h a n d , you'll g a i n
prestige, cash a n d the foundations f o r G M
research that c o u l d c h a n g e the world for the bet-
ter. O n the other hand you'll develop a crop that
c o u l d destroy many third world e c o n o m i e s a n d
give o n e p r o d u c e r a n incredibly d a n g e r o u s
monopoly. S o , d o y o u g o a h e a d a n d give M o n -
santo the fruits of your research, o r d o y o u lock
everything in a d a r k e n e d c u p b o a r d ? Well, s o m e
of y o u a r e probably thinking that you should (and
maybe would) take the moral h i g h g r o u n d a n d bin
your work. But h a n g o n , if y o u don't d o it, y o u
know full well that a g r o u p of U S researchers in
C h i c a g o a r e only a few months behind y o u , a n d
they'll probably have given the g e n e to their
backers by the e n d of the year... S o is there ever
any point in trying to control your research, o r
should you always follow through o n your work to
the greatest possible extent? Well, d o y o u really
think that if the scientists e n g a g e d in the M a n h a t -
tan Project h a d followed through o n their threat
a n d walked out o n the U S government in 1 9 4 4
the H b o m b w o u l d never have h a p p e n e d ? N o , of
course not - s o m e o n e w o u l d have m a d e the
breakthrough (although quite possibly not f o r
m a n y years) a n d who's to say that they w o u l d
have b e e n any more cautious with their inven-
tion?
The real p r o b l e m , then, is the fact that y o u
will be labelled with the responsibility (whether
you c h o o s e to take it o r not) for your discoveries,
a n d yet y o u really have n o say over them. T h e
way research is funded means that there will
always be s o m e o n e else out there with a say in
your invention, be they governmental, corporate,
trust b a s e d o r even Imperial C o l l e g e of Science,
Technology a n d M e d i c i n e . A n d most backers will
have f u n d e d your research f r o m profit driven, not
altruistic, motives, s o the likelihood of them lis-
tening to your m o r a l judgements is slim to say the
least. Even if the most d a n g e r o u s aspects of your
discoveries a r e entirely accidental (they frequently
are) your backers will still want to maximise their
profits (because, if nothing else, they will only be
able to finance future R & D if your developments
prove marketable).
So, d o e s all that m e a n that the scientific c o m -
munity c a n deny all responsibility for the results of
it's work? T h e p r o b l e m is that, if taken t o o far,
logic of this kind c a n remove the weight of
responsibility f r o m everyone. If the scientist is not
responsible for designing the invention, the m a n -
ufacturer c a n n o t be responsible for building it, or
the C h i e f Executive for d e p l o y i n g it. S o w e are left
to h a n g the b l a m e o n the p o o r guy at the bottom
with his finger o n the big red button o r the syringe
- but surely he's just o b e y i n g orders? Ultimately,
everyone must accept their share, because all
have h a d a c h a n c e to m a k e a difference, yet
none have. You could block the use of your inven-
tion, by o n e m e a n s o r another, a n d if y o u c h o o s e
not to then with that c h o i c e y o u a c c e p t responsi-
bility.
As a final note, there's o n e interesting sidebar
to my m a i n e x a m p l e , the M a n h a t t a n Project. In
the fifty four years since the b o m b s were d r o p p e d ,
almost everyone involved in the p r o g r a m m e has
expressed sorrow a n d remorse for what they d i d -
the scientists, the pilot, the m a n w h o o p e n e d the
b o m b bay d o o r s - with o n e key exception - the U S
government. Interpret that a s y o u will...
