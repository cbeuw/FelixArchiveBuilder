The State of the Union
State of the Union
After consultation with one IC
male (who said this column made
me sound 'blonde') I am trying to
sound a bit more 'nails' this week!
CHESA
I don't need to explain again why
we are not NUS, Dave Roberts did it
well last time. Besides he is far more
friendly about the backstabbing gits
that run it than I could ever be. We're
out and it's good for us. We're not
alone in thinking this - other Unions
have left, some never joined! In pre-
vious years there have been ideas on
getting us together as a cohesive
unit. For the first time ever (we think)
we met up last weekend for training
and talks. The most exiting thing was
the suggestion that Northern Services
(a buying consortium which we use,
but that is based in Scotland) could
provide a new southern division. This
could lead to some even better bar-
gains for ICU.
Wamer Brothers update
Allegedly, Warner Brothers care
about IC students. They are really
sorry that they don't give us a dis-
count at the moment and for their
By Tasha Newton, Imperial College Union President
massively high charging - ahhh.
They care in fact so much that they
are prepared to wait until December
to discuss us at their next pricing
meeting!! Still the Imperial College
Union President is not letting them
forget that 'student discount' means
discounts for students and has sug-
gested they remove their digit from
their lower sphincter. They will now
decide at the meeting whether they
can allow our cards direct or whether
they want to produce a card which
we could hand out for them. (That
was my idea, and you'll believe that
until you read the next paragraph.)
They fully apologise for any incon-
venience and understand if none of
you guys choose to go to Warner's in
the near future. In the mean time they
take ISIC cards, which are available
from STA on the walkway. Can I point
out that Virgin are IC friendly and
cheaper?!
HMV
This year HMV have been dis-
tributing discount cards, for ALL stu-
dents. They have been sent out via
the NUS to be issued 'in House'. But,
individual branches have extra cards
to issue to non NUS colleges, unfor-
tunately, the local branch's Saturday
staff are slow to get the message and
have been demanding NUS ID. After
a very guick discussion with the man
from HQ, this has all now been sort-
ed with: a memo to ALL branches to
be nice to us and 300 cards which
are winging their way to ICU as I
speak! HMV have also offered their
sincere apologies. HMV discount
cards should be available from the
Union office this week, hurrah.
Voting for the GLA
Democracy! Register to vote so
you can choose who runs London for
the time you are here as a student. It
couldn't be easier, just email me and
I'll send you a copy of the slip or pick
up a post card from the office. ULU
will be organising hustings for the
candidates, so if you are interested in
what your mayor will do (or not) for
you, watch this space.
Meningitis update
At the time this went to press
things were going much better for the
IC student who contracted meningitis
nearer the start of term. I have sent
him a card on behalf of all the stu-
dents of Imperial College Union.
