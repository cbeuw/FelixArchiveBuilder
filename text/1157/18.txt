Little Mothers
Title
(Island)
Song titles such as The Worry,
Bad to Worse a n d Moody sug-
gested a slightly downbeat feel
might hang about this a l b u m .
Likewise, the maudlin sleeve shot
of the four unsmiling lads nes-
tled a m o n g s t a depressingly
empty furniture sale implied a
R a d i o h e a d - e s q u e offering of
d o o m a n d despair. A n d in fact, if
you listen to what they're saying
on the tracks, this is pretty much
what you get. Subject matter
includes a badly failed relation-
ship with a mate's little sister,
depression over other similarly
fated relationships, a n d cynicism
about... well... broken relation-
ships. H m m . Not o n e to play if
you have any doubts about your
ability to hold d o w n a steady
girl/boyfriend.
Having said this, The Little M o t h -
ers' outlook on life never did the
great blues musicians any harm
(or Radiohead, for that matter),
and there are a couple of g e n -
uinely g o o d tracks o n this
a l b u m ; If Love's What You Want
being perhaps the best example
- an acoustic tune a b o u t . . .
guess what? Lyrics aside, the
musical arrangement m a k e this
a g o o d record for late at night -
just make sure you haven't eaten
cheese as well, or when you
w a k e u p your dreams will have
turned you into a shivering neu-
rotic pile of rubble. O u c h .

This Desert Life
(Geffen/PAL)
E v e r y o n e has listened to the C r o w s ' first a l b u m - August and Every-
thing After - whilst not so m a n y h a v e h e a r d their s e c o n d - Recover-
ing the Satellites. This is d u e to the fact that A u g u s t is r e g a r d e d as
a c l a s s i c whilst Satellites is not. E v e r y o n e k n o w s the s o n g s R o u n d
H e r e a n d Mr Jones but fewer p e o p l e w o u l d be a b l e to n a m e any
s o n g s f r o m Satellites. T h e strange thing a b o u t this is that any reviews
(both critical a n d p o p u l a r ) of Satellites that you r e a d credit it as a
worthy s e q u e l to the b a n d s first a l b u m .
This Desert Life has b e e n in my stereo n o n - s t o p since I r e c e i v e d it
d u e to the s i m p l e fact that it is excellent. A d a m Duritz's v o c a l s c o n -
tinue in their d e s p a i r whilst the m u s i c c o n t i n u e s to rock in the chill
out m a n n e r to w h i c h we h a v e b e c o m e a c c u s t o m e d . I can't find o n e
b a d track o n the w h o l e a l b u m - but I c a n find a n u m b e r that I just
h a v e t o c o m m e n t o n .
Hanginaround o p e n s the a l b u m with a b o u n c e a n d v i g o u r that will
h a v e you s i n g i n g a l o n g a n d m o v i n g y o u r b o d y in ways that you
k n o w are e m b a r r a s s i n g but that y o u just can't stop. All My Friends is
both o n e of the best things they've d o n e a n d a classic m e l l o w e d out
tune of despair. Highlife brings t o g e t h e r a stellar a r r a n g e m e n t with
perfectly v o i c e d lyrics. Finally / Wish I Was A Girl is just a r i d i c u l o u s l y
catchy tune even if it d o e s g o o n for hours.
O n e t h i n g I d i d notice h o w e v e r is that there are a c o u p l e of tracks
w h i c h s e e m to h a v e b e e n heavily i n f l u e n c e d by B e n Folds Five. Both
M r s Potters Lullaby a n d Colourblind really c o u l d h a v e b e e n written
by Ben Folds - but the s t r a n g e (and great) thing is that they w o u l d
b o t h (especially Colourblind) be a m o n g the best tracks o n the a l b u m
a n d a c t u a l l y s o u n d better with Duritz's v o c a l s .
It's p o s s i b l e that as in All My Friends "All my friends a n d lovers l e a v e
m e a l o n e to try a n d h a v e a little f u n " but I really w o u l d n ' t m i n d if I
h a d this to listen to o n my stereo. O r at least I w o u l d n ' t a p a r t f r o m
the fact that I really w a n t to g o to that party o n Friday n i g h t . . .
If y o u didn't like August (or Satellites] then you p r o b a b l y won't like
this either, but if like m e you l o v e d t h e m , then y o u r m o n e y s h o u l d
a l r e a d y be out o n the r e c o r d s h o p s counter. This Desert Life is a n
a l b u m that only the tasteless s h o u l d miss.

Royal Trux
Veterans of Disorder
(Domino)
T h e m u s i c a l l a n d s c a p e at the e n d of
the 9 0 ' s is p l a g u e d by irony. M o s t of
o u r p o p stars a r e s u f f i c i e n t l y w e l l
t r a i n e d to talk the talk c o m p l e t e with a
p h o t o g e n i c s m i l e / g r i m a c e / l o o k of
c o n t e m p t u o u s a l o o f n e s s , p l a s t e r e d
u p o n their s m u g f a c e s . In this c l i m a t e ,
p r a i s e the f a l l e n a n g e l f o r b a n d s like
the Royal Trux w h o are p r e p a r e d to
b e l i e v e in rock ' n ' roll as not just a
b a d g e but as a way of life. T h e two
m a i n Trux, N e i l H a g e r t y a n d J e n n i f e r
H e r r e m a , live a n o t o r i o u s l y n a r c o t i c
existence a n d o v e r the past d e c a d e o r
so they h a v e put out a string of r e c o r d s
d u b b e d by m a n y as u n l i s t e n a b l e a n d
s h a m b o l i c .
'Veterans of D i s o r d e r 1
is r o c k ' n ' roll in
the truest sense of that m u c h m a l i g n e d
w o r d . T h e first half of V O D sees Trux
d r a w l a n d snarl their way t h r o u g h a
clutch of g l o r i o u s l y f u c k e d u p , raw a n d
dirty m i n i m a s t e r p i e c e s , every o n e suf-
f u s e d with the k i n d of s w a g g e r a n d
attitude i d e n t i f i a b l e as the real d e a l . As
time p r o g r e s s e s we r e a c h Lunch Money
in w h i c h the Trux get a bit a t o n a l a n d
e x p e r i m e n t a l o n o u r a s s e s , but e v e n
the most d i m right w i n g e r w o u l d find it
h a r d not to s e e the b e a u t y in the
s q u a w k i n g r a c k e t . W e h a v e n o w
r e a c h e d the p o i n t at w h i c h things start
to self-destruct. T h e a l b u m c o u l d h a v e
d o n e w i t h o u t a teeth g r i n d i n g l y self-
i n d u l g e n t s e v e n - m i n u t e g u i t a r s o l o
f i n a l e w h i c h is Sickass Dog, but in the
w a k e of s u c h a j o y o u s , u n h o l y (and
yes, s h a m b o l i c ) p i e c e of rock ' n ' roll
this s e e m s like a m i n o r c o m p l a i n t .
