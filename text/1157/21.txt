S o m e club nights m a n a g e to stand o u t
from others with effortless ease. It's
nothing to d o with their DJ line-up,
nothing to with the v e n u e where they
are held a n d nothing whatsoever to d o
with the state of the toilets. Q u i t e s i m -
ply, the club nights that stand h e a d a n d
shoulders a b o v e others are all a b o u t
the vibe. They s e e m to capture the spir-
it of the house party a n d transport this
heavenly a t m o s p h e r e directly to a club
venue. Last Saturday's C l u b O n e night
was a perfect e x a m p l e of this.
Put o n by a g r o u p of p e o p l e clearly
more interested in having a g o o d time
than impressing anybody, C l u b O n e
proved to be a n excellent night for
m o r e than just those o u t for a big o n e .
With a techno-trance mix in the m a i n
r o o m a n d eclectic mix of beats in the
back r o o m , clubbers were treated to a
mystical experience of music rarely
served in the m o r e m a i n s t r e a m clubs.
From p e o p l e d a n c i n g like n o o n e w a s
watching to those just sitting a r o u n d o n
the f l o o r chilling out, this w a s a house
party in a club a n d the vibe w a s clear
for all to see. Indeed, as o n e w a l k e d
a r o u n d a feeling that everyone k n e w
e a c h other s e e m e d to o o z e f r o m every
Sadly t h o u g h , these C l u b O n e nights
are something of a rarity, as they only
seem to a p p e a r every few months with
little p r o m o t i o n . Yet it is m a y b e this
infrequency that keeps the vibe so
alive, a n d the p e o p l e present so spe-
cial. A n d this is why this club is not
called C l u b O n e a n d why it is not held
at VenueTwo. Sorry.

Ram Trilogy Parly @ The End
..if you like it hard...
With the recent opening of home a n d Fabric, the End could have
found itself struggling to keep up. However, Friday night proved
that this venue a n d the genre of drum a n d bass c a n still get the
punters in. This was a 'roadblock' event with the club almost full
to capacity by midnight.
The first couple of sets in the main room were g o o d without real-
ly getting the crowd jumping, playing music that anyone c a n eas-
ily get a hold of. The lounge was a more laid back affair with drum
a n d bass being played first up, but not the real heavy bass line
stuff, complementing the havoc being created in the main r o o m .
It then switched to hip h o p before finishing with some chilled out
breaks a n d beats.
Enter Roni Size o n the decks, in the main r o o m . His reputation
precedes him with main r o o m getting packed out to the point that
it w a s almost impossible to move. H e played an excellent set with
a mixture of jazzy breaks, vocal tunes a n d bass heavy dubplates.
He really did get the crowd going a n d the presence of M C D y n a -
mite only a d d e d to experience.
Next up c a m e the highlight of the night. Andy C c a m e to the decks
with crowd at boiling point. N o w to those of you that don't know,
Ram records is Andy C s label a n d so you would expect this set
to be special. H e didn't disappoint. He played a technically a m a z -
ing set, running mixes at length a n d constructing the set well. H e
mixed up the set playing the very newest dubplates a n d dropping
the o d d blast from the past- you didn't know which way he was
going to take it next. S o m e might have felt that his set was maybe
too bass heavy, but the nutters in the crowd were feeling it hard!!!
Next up o n the decks were the highly acclaimed producers, ed-
rush & optical - they played a g o o d set although it was a little anti-
climactic after the mayhem that preceded it. Randall closed the
night off with a tight set mixing the b-line styles with the more
experimental stuff.
All in all a g o o d night was h a d by all, with a broad spectrum of
drum a n d bass catered for. Those of you that are interested, there
many more drum a n d bass nights from n o w to the e n d of the year
at the End. It's still a wicked venue - pretty modern with a body
shaking sound system. Watch out Fabric, the End isn't d e a d yet.
