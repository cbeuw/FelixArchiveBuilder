^ w o r k i n g in the u k j
M a n y international (non E u r o p e a n )
students m a y still b e u n a w a r e that
as long as they don't have a n entry
c l e a r a n c e s t a m p which states that
they a r e prohibited f r o m w o r k i n g ,
they c a n n o w work f o r u p to 2 0
hours per week in term time, o r full
time in t h e v a c a t i o n s . This is
because the g o v e r n m e n t g a v e what
they described as " b l a n k e t permis-
sion" to all students w h o have the
restriction stamp in J u n e of this
year. (The restriction s t a m p is the
one that says that you n e e d t o g e t
permission f r o m the Secretary of
State f o r E m p l o y m e n t before y o u
can work). Therefore, y o u c a n work
in the U n i o n o r in C o l l e g e , y o u c a n
take u p s u m m e r p l a c e m e n t s o r d o
any other kind of work without
needing to g o through any further
bureaucracy (apart f r o m getting a
N a t i o n a l I n s u r a n c e n u m b e r l ) .
S o m e employers a r e still c o n f u s e d
by the c h a n g e s , however, s o if y o u
experience a n y difficulties please
contact m e . The situation f o r w o r k -
ing after g r a d u a t i o n is still the s a m e
and work permits a r e r e q u i r e d . It
c a n b e possible to stay o n f o r a
year o r so to get work experience o r
to d o s o m e training but this won't
a l l o w e d you t o switch over to a full
work permit. Let m e k n o w if y o u
have any questions.

You'll have to forgive m e f o r g o i n g
on a b o u t h o u s i n g , a n d I h o p e that
everyone is r e a s o n a b l y settled into
their a c c o m m o d a t i o n at this point.
I think that a c o u p l e of things
are worthy of r e m i n d e r ; firstly, if
you d i d not get a n inventory taken
w h e n y o u m o v e d i n , y o u s h o u l d
have d o n e o n e yourselves. If y o u
haven't d o n e this, d o it n o w a n d
take p h o t o g r a p h s of the property
so y o u c a n s h o w w h a t it w a s like in
the event of a dispute w h e n y o u
leave. L a n d l o r d s d o often k e e p
d e p o s i t s c l a i m i n g that students
have c a u s e d d a m a g e . If y o u leave
without a n inventory o r p h o t o -
g r a p h s , it c a n b e very hard to
a r g u e a case.
If anything breaks while y o u
are in t h e property through w e a r
a n d tear (a chair, a n a p p l i a n c e etc)
you must write to the l a n d l o r d a n d
notify them of this. O t h e r w i s e w h e n
you leave y o u m a y face d e d u c t i o n s
f r o m your deposit.
Similarly, if s o m e t h i n g is in
lord, simply notifying him/her of
the p r o b l e m . K e e p a c o p y a n d
m a k e sure it is d a t e d . T h e reason
for this is that if the l a n d l o r d were
to refuse to d o the repair a n d y o u
h a d t o take further a c t i o n , a court
w o u l d n o t expect t h e l a n d l o r d to
k n o w a b o u t the p r o b l e m until y o u
c a n s h o w that y o u b r o u g h t it to
their attention. If a l a n d l o r d d o e s
n e e d of repair, there are two steps
you must take. Firstly, check your
tenancy a g r e e m e n t to see whether
or not the l a n d l o r d c a n e n d it early.
This c a n only b e d o n e if the l a n d -
l o r d h a s a " b r e a k c l a u s e " in
his/her favour, a n d this is n o t a
s t a n d a r d c l a u s e . If there is a break
c l a u s e , this s h o u l d have a n i m p a c t
o n y o u r n e g o t i a t i n g p o s i t i o n
b e c a u s e y o u m a y want to b e as
nice t o t h e l a n d l o r d a s possible
while getting t h e repair d o n e . If
there is n o break clause a n d y o u
are, f o r e x a m p l e , secure in your
flat until t h e e n d of term, the first
thing t o d o is to write to your land-
not carry out repairs within a r e a -
s o n a b l e time, they are in b r e a c h of
contract.
If, f o r whatever r e a s o n , y o u are
thinking of leaving your a c c o m m o -
dation early, it is essential that y o u
check your legal position. Even
t h o u g h y o u might have a morally
g o o d reason f o r m o v i n g out, this
may n o t release y o u f r o m your
contract. If y o u break a contract,
landlords c a n (and s o m e t i m e s d o )
sue f o r m e r t e n a n t s , e s p e c i a l l y
w h e n they have g u a r a n t o r s . It is
also s o m e t i m e s possible f o r your
co-tenants t o sue y o u if y o u break
your contract a n d they lose money.

It's b o r i n g I k n o w but if y o u haven't
d o n e it this term, m a k e sure y o u set
yourself a b u d g e t f o r the next. B u d -
geting is as simple as dividing your
termly i n c o m e into weeks, a n d then
subdividing into the things that you
n e e d a n d the things that y o u want.
