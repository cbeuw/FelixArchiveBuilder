This fixture s a w t h e return o f t h e
mighty sixths t o the g r o u n d w h e r e
we thrashed t h e U C L w h i p p i n g
boys 7 - 1 in the c u p last s e a s o n .
The journey w a s a contest in itself -
a b r e a k d o w n in c o m m u n i c a t i o n left
us without a keeper. T h e m a t c h
started untidily, with the w i n d a n d
wet pitch c a u s i n g p r o b l e m s f o r
both sides. M a r k , o u r n e w m i d f i e l d -
er ( a n d a g a m e s editor of this
esteemed paper, might I a d d ) f e r o -
ciously went f o r the b o b . . . knees of
their players, sliding in f r o m a l l
angles a n d nearly always w i n n i n g
the ball! After p r o b i n g their b o x
several times, IC s c o r e d albeit by
an o w n g o a l f r o m a D a n M cross.
W e scored a g a i n s o o n afterwards,
a D a n W penalty f r o m a foul o n
D a n M . O K , s o p e r h a p s w e h a d
been lucky s o f a r but o u r third w a s
pure class, D a n M p a s s e d t o D a n
W w h o flicked it b a c k a n d the shot
hit t h e t o p corner. In t h e s e c o n d
half the D a n a n d D a n s h o w started
a g a i n but failed to break t h r o u g h .
Instead, A n i m e s h , with Rival-
d o e s q u e b r i l l i a n c e r a n f r o m
halfway (with t h e ball f o r once!),
thrust through the hole in their back
line a n d l o b b e d his shot over the
keeper into the net. A n o t h e r o w n
g o a l put us 5 up a n d the g a m e lost
al! e d g e . With 2 0 m i n s to g o , J a m e s
d e c i d e d to start playing a n d scored
a hatrick. Blatantly offside (their ref.
was awful) f o r his first, n o . t w o
c a m e f r o m smart play by Matt o n
the left, w h o , a b n g with Rob a n d
Luis, w o r k e d hard all g a m e even
t h o u g h out of position. Before n o .
3, they pulled o n e back. A long ball
f r o m the b a c k went over the other-
wise excellent centre back pairing
of the two Alex's to first-rate stand in
keeper Leon. T h e slippery wet ball
fell f r o m his gloveless hands into the
path of their onrushing striker w h o
gently stroked it in. Furious at this
lapse, Alex Jekyll n' Hyde went in
search of a g o a l , steaming forward
like J o n a h L o m u b u t getting
n o w h e r e before J a m e s sealed it
with his third, a simple n u t m e g a n d
the last kick of the g a m e .

D i s c D o c t o r s (the Imperial C o l l e g e
Ultimate Frisbee team) in the f o r m
of a friend!y fire t o u r n a m e n t at
Regents Park. K i n g s a n d U C L
stepped u p t o play, a n d a s there
were s o m a n y of us, w e split into
two teams - a D a r k s i d e , a n d a
Lightside.
The D a r k s i d e
The D a r k s i d e played Kings first,
whose recent a d d i t i o n w a s a n ex
Discdoctors player ( a n d ISE stu-
dent). W e o p e n e d with a g o r g e o u s

tions' e n d z o n e . U n f o r t u n a t e l y
K i n g s r e p l i e d with t w o c h e e k y
points. T h e D a r k s i d e felt they h a d
had their c h a n c e a n d promptly t o o k
three points o n the trot. J e z kindly
m a d e a n a p p e a r a n c e , a n d with
brushes firmly fixed in o u r m i n d s ,
we finished w h i t e w a s h i n g Kings,
t a k i n g t h e m a p a r t with 1-2 c o m -
bos f r o m " W a t e r b o y " a n d W o r s h i p
M e . W e finally beat t h e m 1 3-6.
U C L were u p next. " J a b b a t h e
Tat" kept u p his extremely solid
a n d tight d e f e n c e , with " T h e Ital-
ian S t a l l i o n " , a l t h o u g h n e w w a s

the stack a n d w a s r e w a r d e d with
s o m e nice passes t o h i m . T h e
h a m m e r i n g of U C L w a s short a n d
sweet, a n d a l t h o u g h w e d i d n ' t
b a g e l t h e m , w e still t r o u n c e d t h e m
1 3 - 4 .
Finally, b e f o r e it g o t t o o dark
to play, w e p l a y e d t h e Lightside.
A l t h o u g h n o t really a m a t c h , w e
still bea t t h e m 6 - 2 , a n d W o r s h i p
M e a n d M a r t i n d e m o n s t r a t e d that
practice m a k e s perfect, b e c a u s e
o n their 5 0 t h attempt, they finally
m a n a g e d to huck it into t h e e n d
z o n e f o r a point.
The Lightside
O u r first m a t c h o f t h e d a y w a s
a g a i n s t U C L . W i t h i n t h e first half
h o u r we were u p 5 - 0 . T h e arriva!
of C a t c h started o u r p l u m m e t t o
the depths o f despair. W i t h i n 1 5
minutes w e were level at 7 a l l , h o w
c o u l d w e b e d o i n g s o badly? After
an h o u r the g a m e w a s c a p p e d a t
1 1 points, with the score 1 0 - 9 to
U C L . A l l w e n e e d e d w a s 2 straight
points t o seal victory. T h e first
c a m e f r o m a q u i c k r e s p o n s e to o u r
i m p e n d i n g d o o m . B u t their
r e s p o n s e w a s just t o o g o o d a n d
they stole the g a m e f r o m us. 1 1 -
10 to U C L .
The s e c o n d m a t c h w a s a g a i n s t
Kings. W e didn't d i s a p p o i n t o u r
a d o r i n g fans with s o m e s t o r m i n g
play a n d solid d e f e n c e . They didn't
stand a c h a n c e , p e r h a p s a little
unfair but w e still m a n a g e d a w i n
with t h e final s c o r e 1 2 - 7 t o t h e
Lightside.
O u r final a n d most c h a l l e n g -
ing m a t c h w a s a g a i n s t ourselves
(?). O K a g a i n s t the D a r k s i d e . With
Astro-fuck h a v i n g g o n e t o w o r k w e

subs). W e started off w e l l , but r e a l -
ly c o u l d n ' t b e a r s e d . T h e final
straw c a m e w h e n B a b y s u b b e d off
injured a n d in the true spirit o f the
g a m e they g a v e us their W a t e r b o y
as a r e p l a c e m e n t . With that w e
quit with the s c o r e at 6 - 2 to the
D a r k s i d e .
A special mention has to g o out
to C o n s t a n t Pressure w h o c o u r a -
geously m a n a g e d 5 minutes o f a
