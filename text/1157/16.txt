Music Felix • 15 November 1999
frequencyN/\
O h dear. W e ' r e only in the
sixth week of a thirty o n e
week year a n d the backlash
a g a i n s t Felix has b e g u n
a g a i n . Sadly f o r m e , the
reviews section always seems
to bare the brunt of this
abuse. However, insults such
as everything we review is
u n h e a r d of is just p l a i n
wrong. If the slanderers h a d
b o t h e r e d to e x a m i n e the
review pages of Felix in recent
weeks they'd have seen inter-
views, reviews a n d c o m p e t i -
tions involving s o m e of the
most m a i n s t r e a m artists in
music, films, art a n d b o o k s .
This week a g a i n sees another
storming line- up. For a start
in the two following c o l u m n s
we see reviews of the n e w
F o o Fighters a n d M a r i o h
C a r e y a l b u m s - a n d w h o c a n
c o m p l a i n a b o u t that?
... frequency...
ifs rubbish,
nobody reads it?
With the rest of this s p a c e I'd
like to m a k e another plea for
people interested in writing
music articles for Felix. C l u b
writers are especially hard to
c o m e by a n d if a n y o n e is
interested in writing in g o i n g
clubbing for free for the small
exchange of a short article
a b o u t the night then I'd be
more than happy to have
you. If you're interested just
p o p a l o n g to the Felix Porta-
cabins for o u r music meetings
at 1 2 . 3 0 p m o n Tuesdays a n d
we'll sort it out.

There Is Nothing Left To Lose
(Roswell/RCA)
W h a t h a v e y o u r h e r o e s b e e n ? A c t o r s ? Politicians? S p o r t s m e n a n d
s p o r t s w o m e n ? O u t s t a n d i n g scientists a n d b u s i n e s s m e n ? Balls t o a l l
that. M y h e r o e s h a v e a l w a y s b e e n m u s i c i a n s . N o t y o u r p o n c y l a c k of
s u b s t a n c e b o y b a n d s o r t h o s e m o r e t h a n useless o n e - h i t - w o n d e r s ,
but p r o p e r kick-ass don't-give-a-shit stars: J i m m y P a g e , Kurt C o b a i n ,
Jimi H e n d r i x , F l e a - all t h o s e with a p r e s e n c e a n d attitude. T h e F o o
Fighters' D a v e G r o h l is u p there t o o - he's g o t to b e . F r o m p o w e r -
h o u s e d r u m m i n g with y o u - k n o w - w h o , to l a y i n g d o w n the F o o Fight-
ers' 1 9 9 5 d e b u t a l o n e , he's m o r e t h a n just a slightly m o t i v a t e d b l o k e .
This latest o f f e r i n g f r o m the F o o s is m o r e of that d r i v e n p o w e r p o p
that they've m a d e their o w n .
I r e a d s o m e w h e r e that the F o o Fighters m i s s e d the m a r k with There
Is Nothing Left To Lose b e c a u s e ifs t o o u p b e a t to b e g r u n g e . C a n w e
p l e a s e set the r e c o r d straight: T H E R E IS N O S U C H T H I N G A S
G R U N G E . Invented t o create a n i c h e a n d sell r e c o r d s ; 'nuff s a i d . A n d
n o , this a l b u m isn't that Seattle s o u n d that served D a v e G r o h l s o well
in the past - I'm sure he doesn't w a n t it t o b e .
W e kick off as w e m e a n to g o o n with the h u g e c h o r u s of S t a c k e d
Actors. I h a d this o n my W a l k m a n a n d e n d e d u p d a n c i n g a l o n g the
street like a l u n a t i c , a sure s i g n of a p r e m i u m t u n e . T h e d r u m s play
a l a r g e part in the F o o Fighters' s o u n d , p o s s i b l y b e c a u s e that's w h a t
D a v e G r o h l started w i t h , but I a l w a y s f i n d the d r u m l i n e s a r e that lit-
tle bit m o r e i n v o l v i n g a n d s u b s e q u e n t l y the s o n g s a r e g i v e n a g r e a t e r
d e p t h . That's n o t t o s a y a n y o t h e r part o f the track is n e g l e c t e d ; the
guitars h a v e a distinctive w a r m , fuzzy o v e r d r i v e a n d in D a v e G r o h l ' s
v o i c e there's a h a r s h e d g e t o the soft g e n t l e n e s s as d e m o n s t r a t e d t o
g o o d effect o n Live-In Skin.
T h e r e a r e s o m a n y tracks worthy of b e i n g s i n g l e s o n There Is... I'm
s u r p r i s e d there weren't t w o a l b u m s r e l e a s e d . T h e r e really isn't a n y
filler. Generator h a s a g r e a t T a l k b o x effect o n l e a d guitar, Next Year
is a s u p e r b s o n g to l e a d us into Autumn with ifs wistful lyrics a n d
A u r o r a is in a s i m i l a r c a v e r n o u s vein t o February Stars.
T h e F o o Fighters h a v e b r o u g h t us a b e a u t i f u l third a l b u m , a m o r e
p o p p y s o u n d but a r o u n d e d o n e t o o . They'll b e a r o u n d f o r a w h i l e
yet, but I w o u l d n ' t expect a n y less f r o m a m a n w h o has the b a n d ' s
l o g o t a t t o o e d o n the b a c k of his neck.
Marian Carey
Rainbow
(Columbia)
O h , M a r i a h , M a r i a h , M a r i a h . Back so
s o o n ? I'm not generally of the school of
thought that thinks that if anything is p o p u -
lar it must by definition be b a d , but I heard
an interesting statistic the other day that
has started to c h a n g e my mind. It was that
M a r i a h C a r e y is the best selling female
artist of the 1 9 9 0 s , has sold over 1 1 5 mil-
lion albums. I m e a n , w h o bought these
albums? W h e r e are they a n d why are they
still allowed their statutory rights?
That M s Carey should outsell M a d o n n a ,
Whitney Houston o r even her musical
nemesis Celine D i o n is unbelievable. I
admit that in the past she has released
s o m e fairly g o o d singles, notably Hero, (7/
Be There a n d . . .er.. .anyway, she c a n cer-
tainly Sing (she's a vocal range of 8 octaves
you know). Fine, but the point is, should we
buy this a l b u m for musical pleasure or
because it is able to c o m m u n i c a t e within
the hearing range of next door's d o g ?
Rainbow sees M a r i a h collaborating with
many R 'n' B superstars but this is not an
a l b u m for R 'n' B fans. The first track Heart
Broker begins in typical M a r i a h style with
all the usual vocal acrobatics but then we
get a somewhat unexpected rap interlude
halfway through. Finally, it's back to M a r i -
ah. It really just doesn't work. She should
stick to her epic ballads - they at least suit
her style. The personal a n d understated
melody of Petals is the nearest she gets to
this but the rest, I'm afraid, just bored me.
She m a y be trying to move with the times
but ifs doubtful if all the millions w h o (for
whatever reason) love her, will want to
move with her.
