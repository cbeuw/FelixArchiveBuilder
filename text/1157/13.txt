STUDENT BODIES
D e a r Editor,
W e were offended by the article
in last week's In Brief o n p a g e two of
Felix. The author suggested that no-
o n e at IC ' h a d it in them' w h e n
referring to the M a t h s c o u p l e caught
in flagrante delicto in their locker
r o o m .
D o e s the Editor not think it is
d e m e a n i n g to the students here at
IC to have their o w n student news-
p a p e r put them d o w n as unadven-
turous when we already have to put
up with insults from the rest of the
country's student body?
W e assure you that this is not a
solitary example a n d the maths c o u -
ple should not be m a d e a spectacle
of in a p a p e r with such a wide a u d i -
ence.
M a y b e the Editor has heard of
couples using such places as the
main library, o r even the Sherfield
building for uses other than those
the buildings were intended for?
O b v i o u s l y not. A walk a r o u n d
c a m p u s may o p e n the Editor's eyes
to the more exciting aspects of
Imperial C o l l e g e .

S H O P STRIFE
D e a r Sir,
It was interesting to be r e m i n d -
ed of this year's g r a d u a t i o n by the
account in Felix a few issues a g o
because as well as being the e d i -
tor's g r a d u a t i o n , it was also my
friend's. Imagine h o w joyous this
o c c a s i o n is: the proud family l o o k -
ing o n , the p h o t o g r a p h s , the pres-
ents a n d the g r a d u a t i o n card with
" c o n g r a t u l a t i o n s " i n s c r i b e d . N o t ,
however, if one were to visit I C U
shop.
A week before g r a d u a t i o n , I
went to buy all the associated m e m -
o r a b i l i a , i.e. ties, t e d d i e s a n d
scarves to remind the graduate of
his past life at Imperial a l o n g with a
graduation c a r d . Q u i t e a c o m m o n
occurrence, g r a d u a t i o n , especially
at a college o n e might be lead to
believe but not o n e single c a r d was
available at the s h o p . After a s k i n g , I
was told they might be ordered but
the staff s e e m e d more interested in
ignoring the request for fear of stick-
ing more price tags o n t-shirts. O n
the M o n d a y before graduation, I
was told the graduation items w o u l d
be included in stock a n d visited
a g a i n but to no avail but was told
sanctuary was available o n the day
in the U n i o n with a little stall. N o
such luck - it was only T-shirts a n d
mugs.
H o w c a n a simple card like
graduation be omitted from stocks
at G r a d u a t i o n time? If I wanted to
buy a card from I C U shop o n prac-
tically any other subject, I c o u l d d o
so, even if I wanted to m a k e inde-
cent proposals I c o u l d d o so from
the vast collection available! Let
other IC students join in the c e l e b r a -
tion of their peer's excellence at
leaving Imperial a n d not say, " O h ,
sorry, ICU s h o p couldn't be assed to
stock it "
Yours faithfully,
I C U Shop's best customer
A N D FINALLY...
D e a r Felix
I w o u l d like to c o m m e n d you on
the improvements m a d e within the
reviews pages this year. The breadth
a n d depth across fhe whole of the
music, clubbing, film, books a n d
arts world is to be a p p l a u d e d . I
w o u l d especially like to mention the
Blair Witch feature a n d the diverse
club a n d art features that have f e a -
ture gay a n d fetish themes. I was
therefore a p p a l l e d when I read the
slating Felix received in Prince Albert
this week. N o t only were the insults
ill thought out, but the text content
was worse than the childish rants
that I have sometimes seen in the
C & G rag - Guildsheet. The writers
of this magazine obvious have a
n u m b e r of problems, the first is
being happy to c o m e to an opinion
based on nothing less than prejudice
a n d the second is being obsessed
with rude words (very clever).
Yours with love

PS. Please put my sleepless nights at
end - w h o is this a m a z i n g girl [see
editorial, 1156]. I've spent all last
week searching for her.

L A T E N T M E D I A BIAS
First of all this w e e k , a m a s s i v e
a p o l o g y to M u s t a f a Arif a n d a n y -

front p a g e l e a d to be o f f e n s i v e .
M u s t a f a raises a n interesting pint
that a p p l i e s not just to s o - c a l l e d
" I s l a m i c " f u n d a m e n t a l i s t s but, o n
a b r o a d e r c a n v a s s , to a n y f o r m
of s u p p o s e d l y r e l i g i o n - b a s e d
terrorism o r e x t r e m i s m . After a l l ,
to the best of my k n o w l e d g e ,
there is n o m a j o r r e l i g i o n o n the
p l a n e t that actually c o n d o n e s (let
a l o n e a d v o c a t e s ) the m u r d e r of
o t h e r s ( n o n - b e l i e v e r s , s i n n e r s ,
whatever) - a n d yet, t h r o u g h o u t
history, r e l i g i o n has b e e n the
c a u s e of m o r e a n d b l o o d i e r w a r s
t h a n a n y t h i n g o r a n y o n e else.
S o , (to get b a c k to the point)
b o t h myself a n d G a r e t h a p o l o -
gise unreservedly. W e term t h e m
" I s l a m i c " s i m p l y b e c a u s e they d o
so t h e m s e l v e s , not out of any
sense of a b u s e o r d i s c r i m i n a t i o n .
- i n d e e d the b i g g e s t p r o b l e m
with f i n d i n g a n a d e q u a t e t e r m i -
n o l o g y for these g r o u p s is the
fact that it's very h a r d to f i n d out
w h a t they d o b e l i e v e i n .
A s a final p o i n t , I d o t a k e the
s u g g e s t i o n that I a m I s l a m o p h o -
