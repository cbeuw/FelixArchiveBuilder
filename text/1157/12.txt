ISLAMOPHOBIA?
D e a r Sir,
Imagine if Hitler had c l a i m e d to
be a Christian. Imagine if he h a d
c l a i m e d that N a z i views a n d polcies
were Christrian teachings. W o u l d w e
refer to h i m (or other fascists) as
Christian fundamentalists, fanatics
or extremists? A l m o s t certainly not
b e c a u s e w e k n o w that fascist think-
ing g o e s a g a i n s t true C h r i s t i a n
teaching a n d thus that his claims to
be Christian were false.
So why is that Felix has d e c i d e d
to insult the s o m e 3 0 0 M u s l i m stu-
dents a n d staff at IC by declaring o n
the front p a g e that i C U C o u n c i l
M e e t i n g is under threat from "Islam-
i c " f u n d a m e n t a l i s t s ? These a n d
other w a c k o groups m a y well be
" f u n d a m e n t a l i s t " , " e x t r e m e i s t " o r
" f a n a t i c a l " but the message they
convey is not Islamic.
O f c o u r s e , while w e might
deserve a n a p o l o g y , w e probably
can't expect one. After all, the Run-
nymede Trust in 1 9 9 7 published a
d e t a i l e d report o n t h e e n d e m i c
nature of I s l a m o p b o b i a in the British
m e d i a a n d has set u p a c o m m i s s i o n
to monitor it. Virtually a day goes by
without s o m e newspaper report of
s o m e d o d g y g r o u p claiming to be
Islamic w h o are then portrayed as
such. H o l y w o o d films such as True
Lies (which portray M u s l i m s a s ter-
rorists) don't help m u c h either. T h e
a v e r a g e Briton's steoretype of a
M u s l i m is an A r a b or A s i a n branding
a kalashnikov out to kill all the Jew-
ish p e o p l e they c a n find.
In fact, I s l a m a p h o b i a is not just
a British p h e n o m e n o n but a w o r l d -
wide p r o b l e m . S o m u c h s o that it
has e n a b l e d p e o p l e like S o l b o d a n
M i l o s e v i c to exploit public sentiment
by g a i n i n g p o p u l a r support, in their
o w n country, f o r " e t h n i c " cleansing
of M u s l i m s in Bosnia a n d K o s o v a .
W e n o w see Russian leaders exploit-
ing their o w n citizens' I s l a m a p h o b i a
in exactly the s a m e way t o gain s u p -
port for slaughtering m o r e M u s l i m s
in C h e c h e n y a . These practices a r e ,
of course, very similar to those used
by Hitler in G e r m a n y to g a i n p o p u -
lar support f o r the persection of
Jews.
W h a t w e c a n expect f r o m Felix,
however, is clear reporting which
breaks d o w n stereotypes rather than
strengthening them. Islam is n o w the
s e c o n d most widely practised reli-
g i o n in Britain (and indeed the rest
of the world). Followers c o m e from
all walks of life a n d it is neither
fanatical n o r exteremist. Its m e s -
s a g e , however, is often distorted by
s o m e p e o p l e claiming to b e M u s -
lims f o r their o w n political ends
(especially w h e n a n ignorant body
of p e o p l e c a n b e exploited). I trust
that G a r e t h M o r g a n will, in future,
m a k e a more appropriate c h o i c e of
w o r d s w h e n d e s c r i b i n g extremist
g r o u p s which claim t o Islamic but
convey a very different message.
Yours faithfully,
M u s t a f a Arif

WATERSTONES SURVEY
D e a r Felix,
I w o u l d like to start another dis-
cussion. Waterstones is a wonderful
s h o p which gets all the b o o k s the
students n e e d a n d o n time t o o /
Waterstones is a terrible s h o p which
gets massive a d v a n t a g e of being o n
c a m p u s a n d yet gives nothing in
return.

CHRISTIAN U N I O N
D e a r Felix,
Following last w e e k ' s front p a g e
article, I w o u l d like to set the record
straight o n the position of the C h r i s -
tian U n i o n towards m e m b e r s h i p of
Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n .
The Christian U n i o n at Imperial
C o l l e g e is entirely run by IC stu-
dents, a n d is affiliated with C U s at
most other U K Universities. W e a r e
f u n d e d entirely by o u r current a n d
former m e m b e r s , a n d a r e o p e n to
all m e m b e r s of IC - everyone is very
w e l c o m e to all C U events.
The C U aims t o u p h o l d Biblical
Christianity, s o it is essential that this
is upheld by the society officers. F o r
this reason all o u r officers sign a
widely a c c e p t e d declaration of faith,
which is why w e are not currently a n
I C U society.

Christian U n i o n President
VOICE O F REASON RETURNS
D e a r D a v e ,
Hating d i n g - d o n g battles o n the
letters p a g e a s I d o , I'll b e brief.
Breakpoint, this is m y final w o r d
before they nail the lid back d o w n
o n my coffin. Firstly, the medics d i d
read my c o l u m n , which is w h y s o
many of them t o o k offence. S e c o n d -
ly, the U n i o n fed m e remarkably lit-
tle information- false o r otherwise-
over the course of my time; while
m e m b e r s of Sherfield will sing like
canaries, getting juicy titbits out of
most o f I C U is m u c h less simple.
Thirdly, m y letter, if you recall, mere-
ly stated that attacks o n the U n i o n
should b e undertaken cautiously, not
a v o i d e d entirely. F o r m e t o claim
that the U n i o n s h o u l d n o t b e
attacked in Felix is a b o u t as believ-
able as G e o r g e Best being a front-
m a n f o r A l c o h o l i c s A n o n y m o u s .
Finally, I have never been in the
pocket o f any U n i o n official. I m a y
have got o n a m i c a b l y with several of
t h e m , but then I have h a d a pint with
Ian C a l d w e l l . Nuff said.
I shouldn't really b e writing this.
It doesn't offend me, but it was a tad
wide of the mark. Last w e e k ' s c o l -
u m n w a s very g o o d , t h o u g h if y o u
meet me d o w n Southside, I'll tell you
w h o the real frontrunner is f o r the
Rector's job. H e e p s w a s close, but
the preferred c h o i c e is a little more
surprising.
G o o d night a n d G o d bless
