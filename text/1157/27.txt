This exhibition was something of an O c t o b e r Revolution. If you g o , you
may be forced to a g r e e that it is the exhibition of the year. A m a z i n g as a
whole a n d yet every painting is special in its own right. The hype was:
Five Russian (Natalia G o n c h a r o v a , Luibov P o p o v a , O l g a R o z a n o v a , Var-
vara S t e p a n o v a , N a d e z h d a Udaltsova) a n d o n e Ukrainian (Alexandra
Exter) artist showing m o r e than fifty paintings, m a n y never before seen in
the West. W e follow the careers of these artists in a sweep through the
years immediately before a n d after the 1 9 1 7 Revolution. I went in want-
ing to like this exhibition a n d c a m e out in love. But there are just too
many fantastic pictures here a n d I a m struggling to describe them.
A p p r o a c h O l g a Rozanova's Jack of Hearts a n d you think: she is copying
Picasso. Then you r e a d : painted a b o u t 1 9 1 2 . Then you wonder: this
painting w o u l d pass for a Picasso circa 1 9 6 0 . In 1 9 1 7 , R o z a n o v a paint-
ed G r e e n Stripe (Colour Painting). This is purely abstract, reductive a n d
almost unbelievably a h e a d of its time. P o p o v a is equally impressive with
her b o l d , dramatic, often abstract forms (Painterly Architectonics). These
artists were so avant-garde that they foresaw the future of Western art. Its
almost as surprising as Q u e e n Victoria predicting the internet, a n d then
having her p a l a c e wired up for it.
O f the six, G o n c h a r o v a was the most dedicated painter (the others
worked o n theatre sets a n d textiles). She picked up Western influences
a n d m a d l y ran with t h e m , p r o d u c i n g pictures of quite striking originality.
Starting in 1 9 0 7 with a beautifully executed Impressionist self-portrait
(Self-Portrait with Yellow Lilies), she evolves effortlessly into a more futur-
ist style (Pillars of Salt, 1 9 0 8 ) . T h e n , in a little over two years, she paints
the darkly-brooding masterpiece Apocalypse (Elder with Seven Stars),
which c o u l d be c o n t e m p o r a r y art. So forward l o o k i n g , it was considered
b l a s p h e m o u s a n d c a u s e d a political storm at the time. Unperturbed, she
s p e a r h e a d e d the Russian Cubo-Futurist m o v e m e n t , with pictures like The
Weaver (Loom and Woman).
But the paintings are m o r e than wonderful. Every o n e is a unique syner-
gy of Western influence a n d Russian folk art. G o n c h a r o v a takes the tra-
ditions of Russia a n d reinterprets them in pictures like M o w e r s , which has
the air of a medieval allegorical painting. A l e x a n d r a Exter painted in an
abstract style but was forever interested in the traditional, classical rep-
resentation of l a n d s c a p e , magically expressed in Cityscape (Composi-
tion). I a m speechless!

G a t e c r a s h i n g T h u r s d a y N i g h t C o c k t a i l s at U C L U n i o n . Is this your only
B l o o m s b u r y E x p e r i e n c e ? If it is, B l o o m s b u r y will not be a very evocative
p l a c e for y o u . After c l o s i n g t i m e , we all k n o w that y o u n e e d a junior d o c t o r ' s
s t a m i n a just to stand n e a r those s l o s h e d students s i c k i n g u p a n d u p a n d u p .
But h a v i n g b e e n a U C L u n d e r g r a d u a t e a n d s o m e t i m e resident of C a r t w r i g h t
G a r d e n s , I a l s o k n o w B l o o m s b u r y for its leafy s q u a r e s a n d g r a c e f u l G e o r -
g i a n terraces: semi-mythical h o m e l a n d of that f a m o u s collective of r a d i c a l
intellectuals k n o w n as the B l o o m s b u r y G r o u p . W i t h i n easy s t u m b l i n g dis-
tance of U C L are the f o r m e r h o u s e s of V i r g i n i a W o o l f , J o h n M a y n a r d
Keynes, E M Forster, Roger Fry, V a n e s s a Bell a n d D u n c a n G r a n t . T h e last
three were artists a n d this n e w exhibition f o l l o w s their interlinked careers
f r o m 1 9 1 0 .
Sadly, this exhibition inadvertently portrays B l o o m s b u r y as a fossilised b a c k -
water of artistic mediocrity. A l t h o u g h R o g e r Fry w a s the first to introduce
Impressionism into the British art m a i n s t r e a m , most of his o w n w o r k a n d that
of Bell a n d G r a n t is, without d o u b t , incredibly dull a n d very m u c h of its a g e .
There were o v e r a h u n d r e d a r c h e t y p a l B l o o m s b u r y w o r k s (still-lifes, portraits)
a n d s o m e of t h e m were distinctly third rate. V a n e s s a Bell's The H a / s t a c k ,
A s h e h a m is barely d i s t i n g u i s h a b l e f r o m the p o o r l y e x e c u t e d d a u b s of an
amateur. Yet others give the i m p r e s s i o n of b o r e d o m : i m a g i n e V a n e s s a Bell
sitting a r o u n d with n o t h i n g to d o a n d d e s p e r a t e l y r a c k i n g her brains for
s o m e t h i n g ' c l e v e r ' to paint. In the b a c k g r o u n d of D u n c a n G r a n t ' s Still Life
With Matisse, there is a r e p r o d u c t i o n of M a t i s s e ' s Blue Nude I. I'm a f r a i d to
say that M a t i s s e , even in i m i t a t i o n , put everything else to s h a m e .
T h e t r a g e d y is that there were only five really striking p a i n t i n g s in the entire
exhibition. These w e r e actually not all that w o n d e r f u l a n d h a v e b e e n d o n e
elsewhere a n d better. Yet they were aesthetically p l e a s i n g a n d c a p t i v a t e d me
either by their intimacy with the subject ( G r a n t : V a n e s s a Bell at Charleston
a n d Vanessa Bell Pregnant) o r their vibrant w a r m t h ( G r a n t : The D o o r w a y a n d
South of France; Fry: V i e w o f Cassis).
The i m p a c t of this exhibition relies entirely u p o n its context. T h e B l o o m s b u r y
celebrity c o n n e c t i o n m e a n s that p e o p l e h a n d o v e r m o n e y to see s o m e t h i n g
that w o u l d b e , u n d e r n o r m a l c i r c u m s t a n c e s , firmly r o o t e d in the s e c o n d divi-
sion (and I a m b e i n g c h a r i t a b l e here). But, in spite of this, I c o u l d n ' t h e l p but
fall into the celebrity trap a n d b e g i n to like these pictures.
