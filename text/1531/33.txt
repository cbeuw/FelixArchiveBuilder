t’s a Wednesday afternoon.
You’ve got two projects to-
taling up to 170% of your
degree due in by Friday.
Emotions are high, stress is
building, and not even a steady sup-
ply of Peanut Butter Kit Kat Chunkys
can ﬁll the void between now and the
possibility of freedom at the end of
the week. Slowly, much like Lionel
Richie, you start building into some-
thing resembling a rhythm. Work is
tentatively getting done and you’re
on course to meet your creeping
deadlines.
And then it happens.
The bells start ringing in the
Queen’s Tower. The inevitable
bongs begin to peal across campus.
No study room is safe. The relent-
less metallic thudding shatters any
form of willingness to do work that
you might have had. You have been
defeated by a beacon of unrelenting
noise.
Unfortunately this was not the
fever dream of a student free from
the shackles of imminent hand-in
dates, but was the experience of an
indeterminate amount of people last
Wednesday. An idea immediately
came to mind. An idea that we should
launch an inquiry into the matter!
Oh come on, everybody’s doing it
these days. The Lord Leveson Show
earlier this year showed just how in
vogue ﬁnding the answers from a
ream of bureaucracy and corruption
actually is!
But just what kind of matters must
we propel ourselves into – what is
driving at the hearts and minds of
students at the moment?

On not one, but two (that’s two) oc-

fortune of being unable to locate an
ABC sandwich, arguably the best

sandwich in the Western Hemi-
sphere, across the stacked shelves of
the JCR or Library Café (or, as no-one
prefers to term it, the Librafé). While
vegetable sushi may provide a brief
form of respite, is it enough? This is
just one of the scintillating questions
that an inquiry into the matter would
hope to raise.
Why have I got so many deadlines?
It’s Imperial, obviously. Why did you
even bother to ask?
As demonstrated by these two spec-
tacular examples, the scope for any
inquiry is huge! All you need is a
wood-panelled room, a cause for
grievance, and a desire for (above
anything else) the truth! Or we could
just, you know, work towards our de-
grees and occasionally take part in
extra-curricular activities, it’s always
a tough one.
