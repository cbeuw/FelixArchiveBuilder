A GCSE by any other name...
Joseph Spiking explains the EBacc is more than just a rebranding
n 2015, the biggest
educational reform of our
generation shall be put into
place. The much maligned
GCSE shall be replaced with
the ‘English Baccalaureate’ (EBacc),
the brain child of the Coalition’s
combined educational reforms.
This initial bout of reformation is
reserved only for speciﬁc subjects –
Mathematics, English Literature and
Language, Chemistry, Biology and
Physics. However, Geography, History
and the languages shall also get to
undergo the EBacc transformation in
2017, the inclusion of the Languages
being hailed by Stephen Twigg, the
shadow Minister for Education.
Is the change going to be reserved
to the name of the qualiﬁcation? The
answer to this is a resounding no. The
EBacc unashamedly harks back to the
old days of the O level, where more
emphasis was placed on grammar,
spelling and punctuation. Also, the
current tiered GCSE system shall
be scrapped, alongside the modules
used to divide the GCSE into bite
size chunks. There shall also be no
coursework and no in class assessment
– the child’s performance at the ‘do or
die’ end of year exam shall be the only
factor that decides success or failure.
And, in possibly the most signiﬁcant
change to the current system, there
shall be only one exam board to one
subject. As Michael Gove himself
stated “if we remove modules and
I
reduce coursework, get rid of the
factors that encourage teaching to the
test and, above all, ensure there is just
one exam board for each subject, we
can restore faith in our exams”.
The reception to the proposed
changes has been mixed, some of the
sternest criticisms coming from the
teaching unions, NASUWT and NUT.
NASUWT General Secretary, Chris
Keates, recently said that the changes
were part of a “cynical and wholly
unjustiﬁable attempt to discredit
the quality and rigour of the GCSE
qualiﬁcation”. NUT has criticised
the proposed reforms, arguing that
they shall just “test memory and
essay writing, which are not crucial
skills for the majority of jobs or life
today”. Sir Nicholas Serota, Director
of the Sadler Wells Theatre, raised the
point of the arts subjects that have
been excluded from the Eng Bacc
qualiﬁcation, stating that the arts
“are integral to our understanding of
the world, as important as reading,
writing, geography and arithmetic”.
The architect Richard Rogers, whom
worked on the iconic Pompidou
Centre in Paris and the EU Court of
Human Rights building in Strasbourg,
has also condemned the possible
reforms.
The English Baccalaureate does not
just exclude the arts – IT, Sociology
and Psychology are absences that
shall raise many eyebrows, especially
in an age where all three make up
a signiﬁcant minority of university
courses. The possible impact of this
was considered by UCAS, who argue
that the reforms “could create a two
tier system, where some subjects
lose value, and students may be
discriminated against because of
subject choice”. In reality, this has
probablyhappened–theRussellGroup
have already voiced their preference
for speciﬁc subjects. However, UCAS
go further in their criticisms and say
that there is “a potential for negative
on the arts and the social science and
by discrediting the qualiﬁcations one
gains by studying them, one discredits
the institutions and the pupils that
study them.
Another criticism lies behind the
exclusion of vocational subjects, with
the reforms focusing on academic
subjects, thus ignoring the need for
a vocational qualiﬁcation that carries
the same weight as their academic
counterparts. With the talk of a
‘technical baccalaureate’ fallen by
the wayside, this has worried many
commentators and business leaders
alike, many of whom have already
actively called for a generation of
workers to be practiced in the art of
doing, rather than discussion.
All in all, the reforms by Michael
Gove appear to tackle only one aspect
of a complex problem – the problem
of credible qualiﬁcations within our
school system, whilst wilfully ignoring
other, perhaps more malignant, issues.

impact on social mobility”. This is
possibly one of the most troubling
counter arguments for Michael
Gove, the Minister for Education in a
Coalition Government that has four
Eton educated white males in the
four most important and inﬂuential
jobs in the country (Prime Minister,
Chancellor, Mayor of London and
the Archbishop of Canterbury). The
argument is even more troubling due
to its validity – state comprehensives
and further education colleges thrive

In reaction to public discontent and
pressure for reform, King Abdullah
dissolved parliament in October,
calling for early elections. The new
caretaker cabinet is the ﬁfth cabinet
since the Arab Spring started. Jordan
has so far avoided protests on the
same scale as Libya or Egypt.
Tensions are rising as the need for
reform becomes clearer. The Muslim
Brotherhood and Islamic Action
Front have declared that unless the
Americans have chosen the man to
leadthemforthenextfouryears.China
is easing its way to a new leadership.
How are other countries doing?
Zimbabwe has an important year
coming up: the population will have
to vote in a referendum for a new
constitution and in the presidential
election. Yet, there is one major
concern: money. The ﬁnance minister
electoral system in changed, they may
boycott the polls. The current system
is unbalanced. 60% of the population
is of Palestinian origin and vastly
underrepresented, with little political
power. The opposition demands a
parliament where half the seats are
allocated to party lists compared to
just over a quarter now. The public
reaction to this election will be crucial
for Jordan’s future. Some observers
are already arguing that this is the
beginning of the Jordanian Spring.
has said that the country simply
cannot aﬀord to hold the elections,
estimating their total cost at 129
USD. President Mugabe has already
successfully argued to have three by-
elections postponed, saving the state
38m USD. Foreign bodies like the EU
and the IMF are being appealed to for
funds.
Other than money, the date of the
election is very much debated within
the country. Robert Mugabe, current
president, is pushing for March 2013.
The opposition claims the election is
being rushed and holding it so soon is
“unrealistic”. Moreover, Mugabe and
his party have their reasons to open
the polls sooner rather than later. The
change is constitution must go through
before the presidential election. At the
moment, the two main parties have
not come to agreement. Early elections
could force the hand of the opposition.
Mugabe is also doing well, popularity-
wise. There is a feeling that he has
good chances of winning the coming
vote. His party is also pressed for
time. At age 84 and following rumours
of ill health, there are concerns that
Mugabe might not last long enough
for an election later rather than sooner.
One last fear remains: a repeat
of the violence that followed the
last presidential elections in 2008.
Morgan Tsvangirai, candidate for the
opposition, decided to pull out days
before the vote, alluding to violence
against his supporters.
In 18 months, Afghan voters will elect
their ﬁrst new president since 2001.
Hamid Karzai was nominated as
leader, and then won two successive
elections. The constitution currently in
place prevents him from running for a
third term.
These elections come at a crucial
time for Afghanistan. By December
2014, the NATO mission will come to
an end and most foreign troops will
have left the country. It is unlikely that
the major security issues that aﬄict
the country will have been dealt with
by then. The Taliban remain strong
in some areas and little dialogue
has been established between the
fundamentalist movement and the
state. Without communication, a
peaceful resolution of the conﬂict is
going to be diﬃcult.
There are also concerns over election
fraud and violence. In the previous
elections, only 33% of registered voters
went to the polls and 18% of those
ballots were classed as invalid, in what
has been perceived as a move to favour
the incumbent and successfully re-
elected president
