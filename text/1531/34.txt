A
widely-praised, post-
modern poem by an
anonymous poet-
reporter has recently
been found to also be
a self-referencing news article by
a well-celebrated Felix writer. The
poem contained none of the hall-
mark characteristics of poetry –
rhythm, rhyme, metre or basic im-
agery – but did, however, contain
exactly 283 words of excellent news
coverage. The poem and article
covered a diverse number of topics,
which gave a succinct and power-
ful comment on the state of the
modern world including politics,
economics, poverty, health, climate
change and even a brief foray into
the dichotomy of good and evil.
The single stanza, three paragraph
piece describes, at length, the chal-
lenges facing us all as well as re-
ferring to itself on more than one
occasion. Sources have confirmed
that the article, which first ap-
peared in a section entitled Hang-
man in the prestigious publication
Felix, is in line to receive next year’s
Orwell prize for outstanding politi-
cal journalism, whilst the poem is
rumoured to be a shoe-in for the
National Poetry Competition to be
announced later this year.
There have also been rumours
that the celebrated writer is “just
too good in bed”, and is also “really
good at every single sport”. Appar-
ently, the reporter is “as handsome
as Brad Pitt and George Clooney
rolled into one. But with a huge
penis and abs hard enough to grate
the most unrateable of cheese on.”
Sources suggest that the writer is
“so clever that it actually may be a
bit mean to other people to let the
writer talk, but everyone just loves
the sound of that incredible voice”.
