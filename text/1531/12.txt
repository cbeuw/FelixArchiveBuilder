A trip around America
Maciej Matuszewski reviews Neil Gaiman’s best known novel
ou can’t call yourself a fan
of speculative ﬁction if
you’ve never heard of Neil
Gaiman. He has made a
name for himself with his
proliﬁc writing, not only with novels
but also for the screen and in comic
books. Yet until recently I had never
read any of his longer works. Wanting
to remedy the situation I thought that
there was no better place to start than
with American Gods – his most highly
acclaimed novel.
Winner of the Hugo, Nebula, Locus
and Bram Stoker Awards the book
focuses on Shadow – a man recently
released from prison who ﬁnds that
his wife and best friend have died in
a car crash. At a loss of what to do
with his life he accepts a job oﬀer from
the mysterious Mr Wednesday and
becomes his bodyguard, driver and
occasional accomplice in large conﬁ-
dence tricks. Mr Wednesday, howev-
er, isn’t a simple conman and Shadow
soon gets drawn into a war between
the old and new gods – a war for the
heart and soul of America.
This is highly ambitious and suc-
cessful novel, exploring themes of
loss, power and betrayal. It has a large
cast of complex, engaging and well-
developed characters – many of who
do not necessarily contribute directly
to the main overarching plot but add
depth to the book’s universe and are
simply a joy to read about. Shadow
himself is very satisfying as a main
protagonist – with a powerful and
believable character arc as he grows
from someone who is still obviously
shell-shocked from his wife’s death to
a man who is conﬁdent in himself and
his abilities.
The main focus of the book, how-
ever, are not the characters, nor even
the plot, but rather the United States
themselves. Throughout the course
of the story we explore many places
in that great country – from cities to
small towns to cheesy tourist attrac-
tions. It explores the various con-
tradictions of that place – from the
beliefs and desires of its immigrant
founders to its present day obsession
with media and technology. I believe
that Gaiman himself put it best, say-
ing he considered the book to be “sort
of weird, sprawling picaresque epic,
which starts out relatively small and
gets larger. It’s about the soul of Amer-
ica, really. What people brought to
America; what found them when they
came; and the things that lie sleeping
beneath it all.”
This is a truly great novel: deep and
profound but also very entertaining.
An HBO adaptation is set to premiere
next year so now is the perfect oppor-
tunity to read it.
