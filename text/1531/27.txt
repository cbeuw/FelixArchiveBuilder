Get up and Chase the Dream!
Annabelle Mayers breaks down common startup excuses
or some, overcoming
endless hurdles is a mem-
ory they wish to leave
behind with school PE
lessons. For others the
uncertainty, challenge and commit-
ment involved in developing a start-
up is what provides the buzz that
gets them out of bed each morning.
Motivations:
There are a multitude of reasons
why people wish to create a start-
up but a few factors often prevail.
Firstly, the opportunity to manage
your own time – undoubtedly the
hours will be long and there will be
sleepless nights, but for some this is
considered preferable to being ac-
countable and having to turn up to
the office at 9am day in day out. Sec-
ondly, it is desirable to feel your time
and energy is being invested into
controlling your own future and de-
veloping your brainchild as opposed
to slaving away working for a large
corporation. Finally, whilst there is a
risk of loss there is also potential to
rake in the cash.
A friend suggested there are three
ways to become very rich: Work ex-
tremely long hours for someone else
(read: investment baking), do some-
thing illegal (whilst drug dealing/
weapon smuggling may be lucrative
it’s probably not the key to a bright
future) or finally work for yourself.
In this article we’ll explore the latter
option.
The Idea
How many times have you found
yourself procrastinating work by
daydreaming about business ideas?
It is a shame to think of all these
ideas being mulled over and not
executed. One of them could be a
gem – the next Facebook perhaps?
I met some boys who keep an ‘Idea
book’ where they note down ideas
– however crazy – and brainstorm
each one. Many of the ideas end up
being scrapped but by discussing
their thoughts and combining ideas
they have managed to create feasible
business plans.
I read a striking essay written by
a successful businessman who pro-
posed that you don’t necessarily
need a revolutionary or even new
idea – you simply have to do better
than the competition. Look at dating
websites for example. The market is
huge due to a reduction in the stig-
ma attached to meeting your partner
online and growing numbers of ca-
reer driven people who do not have
the time to find a companion. Yet,
until recently, dating websites did
not facilitate the best matchmaking
resulting in a low success rate. Over
the past few years new models have
sprung up targeted at niche sections
of the population. These sites strive
to make suitable matches and ensure
like-minded people are introduced
to each other. You only have to
glance at the tube adverts to see the
selection on offer from profession-
alsingles to uniformdating.com. Not
advertised on the London under-
ground are those such as Geek2geek
and farmersonly.com. By building
on an existing idea those behind the
array of new sites have learnt from
the mistakes of original players and
earned their share of the $2.1 billion
market. So, don’t be deterred by the
fact your idea is out there in some
form. If you are able to spot funda-
mental flaws and think up inventive
solutions you may be able to secure
a fraction of the market.
That is not to say you should dis-
miss innovative ideas. By making the
first move you have the advantage of
securing the target market before
competitors arrive. A daring man
who did just that is Jay Nemeth –
the man behind the Zero-G cameras
that filmed Felix Baumgartner in
his recent Red Bull sponsored jump
from space. Jay saw an opportunity
in the emerging space tourism pro-
grammes, pursued his passion and
got to work on creating remote con-
trolled cameras that could withstand
such conditions as those found in
space. Red Bull happened to be look-
ing into how to film the feat when
Jay announced that he’d been work-
ing on that very thing. It wasn’t only
Felix who landed on his feet.
Funding
Starting businesses in sectors such
as biotech and oil requires huge ini-
tial investments and unless you have
seriously rich and generous relatives
it may be a difficult sector to break
into. However, not all businesses
need such serious sums of money in-
vested into them. Many modern day
entrepreneurs have mastered ‘Boot-
strapping’; the art of creating some-
thing from the resources available to
you. A common mistake is throwing
money away on the likes of renting
office space and hiring permanent
staff. There is usually no need to
fork out for such expenses; there are
countless tales of folks starting out
with a laptop and their dining room
table. Avoiding such costs will pre-
vent you from depleting the money
you do have and leave more to invest
in the key components required for
your start-up. A useful piece of ad-
vice from the author of ‘Rich Dad,
Poor Dad’ is, ‘Don’t buy what you
can borrow and don’t borrow what
you can get for free’. Participants
of the recent Imperial Apprentice
Challenge proved just how much
value can be created from nothing.
Starting with a paperclip they man-
aged to make hundreds of pounds in
a few hours by trading the paperclip
for items of more value and eventu-
ally selling their trades. Rather than
getting stuck on the treadmill of full
time employment that so often fol-
lows graduation, why not put your
energy into creating value and cap-
ture your share of the money up for
grabs?
Realistically you may need invest-
ment further down the line and
there are plenty of organisations
offering this in return for equity.
For example, Studentupstarts was
founded by an Imperial Student and
offers up to £15,000 investment for
promising entrepreneurs. However,
it is unlikely you’ll receive funding
without some proof of concept so
get the ball rolling, see how far you
can make it and if you envisage the
need for funding apply for it. What
do you have to lose?
The Team
Having a solid team is vital for suc-
cess. It is generally advised not to
combine friends and finance, how-
ever I feel this advice should not be
taken as a given. Whilst it may lead
to discrepancies, which could affect
not only the running of the business
but also your personal life, good
friends fully understand how each
other work, know each other’s skills,
experiences and weaknesses and are
often a tried and tested team. This
could be more valuable than trying
to suss out a stranger and risk work-
ing alongside someone you know lit-
tle about.
Unless you are jack of all trades
you are likely to need people with
complementary skills to yours. In
some cases outsourcing work is the
answer but do not underestimate
the value of having one’s attention
fully invested in the start-up. Whilst
you may be reluctant to dilute your
shares in the business, inviting a
new member into the founding team
may be the reason your business be-
comes a success. Imagine you are
being paid per hour and your suc-
cess does not depend on the suc-
cess of the business – you are likely
to do your work as required and get
on with your life. Now imagine you
have significant equity in the busi-
ness and its success could make you
very rich and happy. Yes, you’ll put
in the extra hours, think outside
the box and throw your energy into
making the project prosper.
Students are in a great position to
develop a business; not only do they
have more time and less to lose than
the typical adult with a steady job,
family and mortgage but they are
surrounded by thousands of young
people in the same position, with
bright minds and ready to make
their path in life. If you envisage go-
ing into the fashion sector perhaps
you should scout talent from a more
gender balanced University than
Imperial but say for example you re-
quired a programmer for your web-
site… need I say more?
Seeking Advice
Sites such as inc.com and youngen-
trepreneur.com provide a daily di-
gest of interesting and eye-opening
articles. Reading around may be the
starting point you need to give you
the confidence and advice you need
to pursue your business idea. If you
decide to do so it will be invaluable to
find a mentor – somebody who has
experienced the rocky path that lies
ahead of you. Often they have been
helped along the journey and will
be more than happy to support you
with advice on mistakes to avoid and
things to consider. Imperial Entre-
preneurs hold, ‘Start-Up Mondays’
with regular speakers every two
weeks – on Monday this week they
had the CEO from TransferWise,
an online platform for transferring
money abroad without the use of
banks as the middle man. Whilst the
UK may be in a mess economically/
politically/socially and every other
‘ally’ it is a big player in the start-up
scene. London is buzzing with net-
working events and opportunities
to meet fellow entrepreneurs. Old
Street (Silicon roundabout) has be-
come the ‘Silicon valley’ of London.
Look out for conferences, talks and
network opportunities. The start-up
scene in the UK is growing so make
yourself part of it… I hope to follow
my own advice and see you there!
Little Steps
The road to entrepreneurial suc-
cess is obviously easier said than
done but who knows whether your
idea will hit off if you never try it?
Take small steps and get the process
moving. Nothing will happen by just
‘thinking’. So, don’t moan about your
boss, disliking your job or lack of ex-
citement if you say you never tried.
Look out for Imperial Entrepreneurs
start-up weekend and Ideas em-
powered next term. Attending such
events can expose you to likeminded
people and give you an insight into
what the path could entail.
I’ll leave you with words of wis-
dom from Richard Branson, King of
entrepreneurism, ‘It’s going to be a
tough Journey, you had better enjoy
it!’
