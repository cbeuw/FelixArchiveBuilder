We can dream
You know the drill: construct a single closed
loop by joining the dots so that the numbered
squares are surrounded by the corresponding
number of lines.
A noble (who I knew to be a Knight) once told me the following story: “I was at the town
square the other day and saw a salesman pitching a miraculous rejuvenating potion in
front of a meager crowd of two. “Does it really work?” I asked one of them. “Of course it
does! Joe Miracle’s no mountebank,” he said. I turned to the other one. “Is at least one of
you a knave?” I asked. He replied, and they both left.”
“Wait”, I said. If you where to tell me B’s exact answer, would I be able to figure out if the
elixir worked?” The Noble replied. “Well, I’m stumped”, I said. “I still can’t work it out.”
TellmeatleastwhatBis.”TheNoblereplied,andIcouldfinallyfigureoutifthesalesman’s
claims had any merit (as a reminder, Knights always tell the truth and Knaves always lie).
What were the crowd members? What were B and the Noble’s replies?
Is the elixir worth buying?

reconcile these two statements is if every voter voted for himself (since every voter is technically
a cohort of themselves). This implies that there was not a clear winner. RW agrees to that, so he is
a knight, and as such, everybody voted for themselves, and nobody won the election. DG, on the
other hand, implies that everybody voted for the same person, which does imply there is a clear
winner, which means that he is a knave as he claims otherwise.
Knights and Knaves
Solution to last week’s Knights and Knaves puzzle:
It’s another nonogam; the
numbers show you the
length of the groups of black
squares as well as how many
of them there are in a row or
column.

Your goal is to con-
nect all the islands with
bridges so that it is pos-
sible to get from any is-
land to any other island.
The restrictions are that
the bridges must be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must
not intersect, there may
not be more than two
bridges between any
two islands, and each
island must have exactly
as many bridges as the
number on it states.
Note that each island
can have two bridges to
the next island!
