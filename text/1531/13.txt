FRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER
Confessions of a TV-holic
Nathalie Skrzypek gives us her take on this week’s TV offerings
fter wasting far too
much time this week
watching all the series
I am addicted to (like I
do every week), I have
compiled a top ﬁve episodes of the
week list and give my thoughts on
them below (SPOILER ALERT):
1.) Castle
Even though I generally stay away
from crime shows, Castle caught
my attention back in the day, due to
my love for Nathan Fillion. My sci-
ﬁ obsession introduced me to Fireﬂy
nearly a decade ago, so my sci-ﬁ ob-
sessed heart skipped a beat when the
Castle producers decided to mock
Fireﬂy for its 10 year anniversary –
and what better way to do so than to
have Nathan Fillion himself judge the
show, while his girlfriend and daugh-
ter out themselves as super-fans?
2.) Two and a Half Men
I feel like the show has gone slightly
downhill since Charlie ‘left’ and I
generally despise Miley Cyrus (god
I hope she was putting that accent
on…), but I found this episode be-
yond hilarious. Berta is one of my
favourite characters on TV and her
describing Miley Cyrus as what hap-
pens when a hillbilly has unprotect-
ed sex with a hummingbird, was one
of her best comments ever.
3.) The Big Bang Theory
Being an Astrophysics PhD student
at Imperial, it is kinda compulsory
to watch The Big Bang Theory. The
show cracks me up every week, po-
tentially because I can identify with
the crazies, but this episode was par-
ticularly good, as Penny managed to
get Sheldon drunk on (Long Island
Ice) Tea to the point where he nearly
forgot his OCD and only knocked on
Will Wheaton’s door twice.
4.) How I Met Your Mother
I found the last few episodes of this
season not too enjoyable, as they
packed all the break-ups in a bit too
closely, but I guess it had to be done,
if the show has to end soon. I per-
sonally ﬁnd this breakup the funniest
to watch, probably because Robin’s
boyfriend is just so very special, Lily
and Marshall are just so very horny
and last but not least, my Barney-
Robin shipper heart hopes that Bar-
ney’s convincing ‘fake’ speech about
how he loves Robin wasn’t all that
fake.
5.) 2 Broke Girls
Despite my initial hesitance about
this show (let’s face it, the synop-
sis sounds very lame… 2 broke girls
working in a diner… who wants to
see that?), the trailer caught my at-
tention and the first episode made
me fall in love with the show. Even
though it is shockingly inappropri-
ate, it is too funny to be offensive.
The latest episode showed Caro-
line from her ‘best’ side and Max
(aka Kat Dennings, who is just plain
awesome) is just an absolute leg-
end.
A
Not to be outdone by my long-
lost- twin Nath (see article above),
I have also compiled a list of my
top episodes from this week.
You may notice that our tastes
are quite similar, although she
claims she only watches Glee be-
cause she is incapable of giving
up on a show once she’s started.
That’s true dedication. But enough
about Nath, onto my opinions.
The Big Bang Theory has a spe-
cial place in my heart and rarely
disappoints, with this week be-
ing no exception. Sheldon drunk
and confused about women is just
priceless. I also simply love every
scene him and Penny are in to-
gether.
Cristina Yang ﬁnally returns
to Seattle! Thank the Gods, I re-
ally missed her snarkiness and her
interaction with the other core
characters. I hope the new interns
on Grey’s Anatomy man up soon,
because they’re getting on my
nerves a bit.
The writers of The New Nor-
mal amaze me with their abil-
ity to produce entire monologues
packed with a gazillion insults and
still make it funny.
As Nath already mentioned, the
number of breakups has put a bit
of a damper on the current sea-
son of HIMYM. That being said, I
still hope this isn’t the last season,
as I feel there isn’t enough time
to introduce the mother and get
Barney and Robin together in a
believable way.
The latest episode of Glee
marked the debut of Glee Project
winner Blake Jenner and I must
admit that I am disappointed with
his character. He just strikes me
as another Finn (and really, one
is enough). Also, I want Kurt and
Blaine back together... like now.
The show just isn’t the same with-
out them as a couple.
She’s definitely pulling that
slit off better than Angelina
