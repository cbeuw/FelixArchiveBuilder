Overall government spending on
Science, Engineering and Technol-
ogy (SET) has fallen in real terms by
£733m.
The drop from 2009-10 to 2010-11
(which is the most recent ﬁgures re-
leased) is the ﬁrst fall since betwen
the 2005-6 and 2006-7. The years
between 2006-7 and 2009-10 have all
seen an increase in overall spending
on Science, Engineering and Tech-
nology.
The change means that spending
is now, in real terms, which means
that inﬂation has been taken into ac-
count, the lowest it has been since
2001-2002.
Public spending science cuts have
been increasingly feared by the sci-
ence community, especially over
the last few years of austerity. These
fears are now becoming a reality,
as shown by the ﬁgures released by
the government; even though the
coalition government had previous-
ly promised to protect the science
budget amid the massive spending
cuts. The Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills’s (BIS) core
science budget for universities and
research councils is not aligned with
inﬂation. This results in a real-term
reduction in spending, particularly
due to inﬂation in these technology
sectors tending to be higher than
the average. Recent ﬁgures show
that in the ﬁrst year of the coalition
government, through individual de-
partments there has been a 7.6%
decrease in government spending
on science. The government spend
constitutes approximately half the
public support for Research & De-
velopment (R&D) and innovation.
The total spending on science activi-
ties during 2010-11 fell by 6.4% when
inﬂation is taken into account.
The shadow science and innova-
tion minister, Chi Onwurah has re-
quested the government to publish
long term ﬁgures. These in turn will
enable scientists to plan better for
resources. Onwurah said: “It’s worse
than we thought. We know the pres-
sure is on departments to cut [and]
this is something they can do rela-
tively silently. There is more to fear
from further cuts coming.” Further
ﬁgures published by the BIS show
large cuts during 2009-11. The de-
partment for Transport slashed
spending on science and R&D from
£82m to £54m, representing a de-
crease of over one-third. The Minis-
try of Defence is the department that
spends the most on R&D, and they
cut its budget by £239m, which is ap-
proximately 13%. BIS is responsible
for the core science budget, yet the
individual departments make deci-
sions on wider spending for R&D
and innovation.
Professor Stephen Curry, a struc-
tural biologist from Imperial College
London has commented that these
are “tough times for UK science if
we are to protect our world-leading
reputation, we need to reverse this
trend as soon as we are able.”
