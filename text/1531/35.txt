Tutorials used to be really
good. All your questions an-
swered. All of your problems
solved. It all changed dur-
ing the great eye incident
of 2012. Not the Olympics
(remember them happen-
ing), the thing that the tutorial
group are bound by social
protocols to not bring up. You
bring it up...
Taurus. Well... Mars is align-
ing with Venus. Obviously
that means absolutely noth-
ing at all because the move-
ments of planets has no im-
pact at all on your love life in
any way. Why would anyone
believe that. Just as Jupiter
aligns with the moons of Sat-
urn you get hit in the eye with
a myserious substance...
This week you’re having a
massive session. Wanking
that is. Obviously. At the last
second your lecturer pops
into your brain. DAMMIT.
You totally spaffed to the
thought of their face. Now
you can’t look them in the
eye again. Mainly because
you did it in a tutorial and
hit them right in the cornea.
Your demonstrator keeps giv-
ing you the eye. Why do they
want you so much? You shrug
and realise this means they’ll
just be inclined to giving you
tip top marks all year. You
don’t even bother to reference,
as you know you’ve got the
marker on side. You get called
out for plagiarism, and told to
stop flirting with staff.
This week you catch your
housemate giving the old “mi-
crowave melon” a go. This is
going to be an awkward year
it seems. Mainly because
you’d been wondering why
your melons all had holes in
them and felt a bit unnaturally
warm. You know you shouldn’t
have watched American Pie
last night.
This week you decide that it’s
about time to bring emo back
as a thing. You dress in all
black and say how your life
suck and you hate it all. Wait,
this is Imperial. You don’t really
stand out from the crowd as
a massive emo during exam
season. If anything, you’re a bit
too chirpy for people’s tastes at
the moment.
This week you watch The X
Factor and realise that you’ve
esentially watched televised
kareoke for the past how-
ever many years. Being a
good scientist you make a
spreadsheet to work out how
many seconds of your life you
have wasted watching this.
You sigh and watch Strictly
Come Dancing on iPlayer.
This week you are giving a
great lecture and suddenly
Kanye West interrupts you.
“YO, I’M REAL HAPPY FOR
YOU, I’MMA LET Y O U
FINISH, BUT THIS
REFERENCE I S
ONE OF THE
OLDEST OF
ALL TIME.
ALL TIME.”
This week someone stands
on the FUCKING LEFT OF A
FUCKING ELEVATOR FOR
THE VERY LAST TIME. You take
action to correct their RUDE
AND INCONSIDERATE BE-
HAVIOUR. DON’T THEY KNOW
YOU MAY BE A MINUTE LATE.
You punch them in the face and
tell them to fuck off. The police-
man you just hit arrests you.
You suddenly realise that
you know London way to
well when you just see the
Tube map everywhere, even
in the horoscopes.
This week you triumphantly
finish your latest piece of
coursework in the Library.
Out of nowhere you get a
bucket of water dumped on
your head and hear “I’m the
Aquarius LOGO”. Your lap-
top breaks and you lose your
work. Worst part. The water
was from a toilet. You start
the Introduction again.
This week you accidentally
bump into someone you
don’t like and are forced to
have an extended conversa-
tion about their life and how
amazing they think they are.
You finally tear yourself away
from the conversation and
think of how to invent an app
to stop this ever happening
again.
HOZOSKIZZLES – IT’S THE HOROSCOPES YEAH
