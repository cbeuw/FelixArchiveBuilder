Climate change is expected to be
more severe than previously thought
as the climate models, which record
the greatest warming, are found to
be more accurate according to a new
study.
Scientists from the National Centre
for Atmospheric Research in the US
used observations of Tropical hu-
midity in the atmosphere to ﬁnd the
models that could reproduce this ac-
curately. One of the authors, John
Fasullo, stated: “There is a striking re-
lationship between how well climate
models simulate humidity in key areas
and how much warming they show in
response to increasing carbon diox-
ide. Given how fundamental these
processes are to clouds and the overall
global climate, our ﬁndings indicate
that warming is likely to be on the
high side of current projections.” The
ﬁnding that the best models also pro-
duce the greatest warming suggests
not only that the Earth will be get-
ting warmer faster, but that extreme
events could become more frequent
and damaging sooner than expected.
Estimations of how much our cli-
mate will warm with increasing car-
bon dioxide vary greatly, with the
largest predicting twice the warming
as the smallest. This uncertainty is
thought to be mainly due to clouds.
Clouds occur on much smaller scales
than climate models can resolve;
hence descriptions of them have to be
written. The diﬀerent descriptions of
clouds in models lead to models disa-
greeing about the eﬀects and spatial
patterns of clouds.
Observations of clouds cannot be
used in a typical way to look at how
well the models perform over long
timescales as we only have measure-
ments of clouds over short timescales
and this is not thought to be an in-
dicator of the eﬀects of clouds over
greater periods. Instead, the authors
use the seasonal change in humidity.
As well as having a better observa-
tional record due to satellites being
able to measure it more easily, hu-
midity is also highly related to cloud
cover.
Sixteen of the climate models that
are regularly used for predicting fu-
ture conditions were tested against
the measurements of humidity made
from two NASA satellites. The test
Overcast with a small
chance of global warming
The European ash tree is a familiar
sight across the UK’s gardens, parks
and countryside, and has been part of
the landscape for many centuries, the
common name even deriving from
Old English.
However earlier this year a serious
fungal disease aﬀecting ash trees,
Chalara fraxinea, was found in
Buckinghamshire, in a consign-
ment of trees imported from
mainland Europe. Despite at-
tempts to contain it the infec-
tion spread across multiple
English counties in the follow-
ing months.
The disease, which ini-
tially causes leaf loss and
dieback and eventually leads
to the death of the tree, has
so far been conﬁrmed found
in 155 sites by the Forestry
Commission. C. fraxinea
has had a devastating eﬀect in
other countries including Denmark
where it led to the loss of 90% of the
ash tree population.
A consortium of experts, including
researchers from Imperial’s Depart-
ment of Life Sciences, are leading the
ﬁght to stop the spread of the disease.
A new product based on copper sul-
phate has been developed, patented
and successfully put through labora-
tory tests
MS drug trial shows potential
A new drug is the most eﬀective treat-
ment for multiple sclerosis (MS), say re-
searchersattheUniversityofCambridge.
The scientists treated MS patients
with alemtuzumab, a monoclonal anti-
body normally used to ﬁght leukaemia.
Alemtuzumab proved more eﬀective
than a ﬁrst-choice drug, interferon beta
1a, in two groups of patients who suf-
fered from relapsing-remitting MS.
One group consisted of patients
where initial treatment had failed, the
other in previously untreated patients.
MS occurs when the immune sys-
tem attacks and damages myelin – an
insulating substance wrapped around
nerves. The impaired nerves fail to
transmit signals as normal. This is par-
ticularly harmful in the white matter of
the brain and spinal cord, which is com-
posed mainly of myelin.
The disease aﬀects almost 100,000
people in the UK.
The ﬁndings showed that in patients
who deteriorated after ﬁrst-choice
treatment, alemtuzumab reduced re-
lapse rate by more than 40% compared
with interferon beta 1a (known com-
mercially as Ribif).
In untreated patients, alemtuzumab
reduced relapse rate by more than 55%
compared with Ribif. Many patients
even showed improvements in disabili-
ty. MRI scans revealed less myelin dam-
age in alemtuzumab-treated patients.
Alemtuzumab wipes out T and B
lymphocytes so they can be replen-
ished anew, essentially resetting the
immune system. It binds to CD-52, a
protein on the surface of lymphocytes.
These lymphocytes are destroyed and
repopulated, leading to long-lasting
changes in immunity.
Despite the obvious beneﬁts of alem-
tuzumab, undesirable side-eﬀects of the
monoclonal antibody were reported. A
highproportionofpatientssuﬀeredfrom
abnormal thyroid function (one in ﬁve)
and thrombocytopenia, a platelet disor-
der. But routine monitoring and educa-
tion can prevent these side-eﬀects, says
Dr Alasdair Coles, who led the research.
The research was funded by Genzyme
(Sanoﬁ) and Bayer Schering Pharma.
Alemtuzumab has since been withdrawn
from the European and US market.
Genzyme intend to remarket the drug
speciﬁcally for MS treatment under the
trade name Lemtrada. There is concern
that this potentially life-saving drug will
be too expensive for many MS suﬀerers
and health services.

was performed for the subtropics,
where the deserts are found, as not
only is this area important for under-
standing our future climate but also
the lack of convection there helps re-
duce any errors in measuring humid-
ity.
The comparison of models and ob-
servations found that the models that
were most accurate in simulating the
subtropical humidity also were the
models that were most sensitive to
carbon dioxide; and therefore predict
the greater future warming. This sug-
gests that models that predict less fu-
ture warming are unable to simulate
enough atmospheric drying and that
this feeds back into the clouds and
is responsible for how much future
warming is seen in the model.
This study has not only helped in
developing a new way of investigat-
ing the accuracy of climate models
but it has helped constrain the range
of future warming. Fasullo says “If we
can better represent these regions in
models, we can improve our predic-
tions and provide society with a bet-
ter sense of the impacts to expect in a
warming world.”
New study assessing climate models against observations provides worrying results

where it was shown to eﬀectively kill
the fungus. The product, CuPC33
, is
now being tested at Imperial’s Sil-
wood Park campus and according to
researchers has proved in greenhouse
trials that it can be safely sprayed on
or injected into trees without dam-
aging them. They hope to carry
out ﬁeld trials on infected trees
in Spring 2013.
A major selling point is that
this is anticipated to be a low-
cost solution, in part because
of the proposed method of
delivery, which uses low vol-
ume spray technology to
make eﬃcient use of the
product. The expected
cost is 60p per litre to
treat a hectare of wood-
land.
If it works as intended,
the product looks set to
be a success for the com-
panies involved, including
Imperial Consultants
who are overseeing the
academic collabora-
tion. We can hope it
will be as much as a suc-
cess story for the British countryside
and will prevent the loss of another of
our distinctive trees.
