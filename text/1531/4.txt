More Grants, Less Money
Imperial has received the highest
amount of research council’s money
out of all the institutions in the UK.
Imperial has received £76.7 mil-
lion in 2011-2012, the most out
of all the institutions that applied.
However, this is a fall of 19% when
compared to last year’s total of
£94.5 million.
The Times Higher Education
(THE) complied data comparing
the number of grant applications
that were successful and the total
amount given for several universi-
ties over England.
It was deduced that there were
fewer applications compared to last
year for Imperial College (360 in
2011-12 compared to 440 in 2010-
2011). But since the average success
rate of these applications increased,
Imperial still received the high
amount of funding.
The table produced by THE
showed that Imperial ranked first
for amount of funding, followed by
University College London, Uni-
versity of Edinburgh, University of
Cambridge and University of Ox-
ford. The complete table shows the
funding, success rate and number
of applications for 20 universities
across the UK.
University of Cambridge saw a
massive drop in their income as
their funding fell from £85.2 million
in 2010-2011 to £56.2 million in
2011-2012, a 34 per cent decrease.
They also had a fall in application
numbers so that their success rate
increased from 33 per cent to 37 per
cent.
Some institutions that actually
had an increase in funding from UK
research councils were the universi-
ties of Birmingham, Edinburgh and
University College London. Univer-
sity of Liverpool had a dramatic rise
in funding from £12.3 million to £24
Aemun Reza News Editor million, therefore almost doubling.
The University of Bath had a giant
leap in their success rate, from 31
per cent to 42. Jane Millar, Pro Vice-
Chancellor for Research at Bath,
said she was pleased with the suc-
cesses, “especially at a time when
funding is getting tough”.
She said that the institution’s sys-
tem of internal academic peer re-
view and “outstanding academic ap-
pointments” had made a difference.
Some institutions contested the
findings of THE, The University of
Leeds had apparently seen a decline
in their funding from £34.5 million
in 2010-2011 to £21.3 million in
2011-2012 as well as a drop in num-
ber of applications and awards.
A spokesman for the university
said the figures did “not give the
complete picture of research coun-
cil funding received by the univer-
sity” because they did not include
STFC cash and collaborative grants
with other institutions.

the science budget. Since then, re-
searchers have been wary of the de-
crease in funding due to inflation.
The cuts for certain departments
exceed 40%. Back in 2010, George
Osborne decided to protect the sci-
ence budget. He said “the secretary
of state (for business) and I have de-
cided to protect the science budget.
Britain is a world leader in scientific
research and that is vital to our fu-
ture economic success. That’s why
I am proposing that we do not cut
the cash going to the science budget.
It will be protected at £4.6bn per
year.” The UK spends approximately
£25bn on R&D, positioning it sev-
enth in the world by % GDP. The ta-
bles show that the UK government is
not spending as much (by %GDP) as
other leading nations. Coupling this
with the real-term cuts could po-
tentially damage the UK’s economic
competitiveness.
In the UK, about 32% of funding
for R&D is provided by the govern-
ment.
When the UK is compared to other
countries in the G7 (United States,
United Kingdom, Italy, France,
Germany, Japan, Canada), the UK
spends the lowest percentage of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on
R&D (see table above).
