limate change and en-
ergy sources are two
of the key issues of our
time. While our climate
becomes more and more
volatile by the year, the strain on
our planets limited resources is
becoming exasperated by the de-
velopment of large economies such
as China and India, which in turn is
damaging the climate.
It’s a vicious circle.
As a result of the competitive
nature of our economic system,
countries are engaging in trade and
actual wars against each other in a
necessary battle for resources.
The world economy is absolutely
dependent on fossil fuels. Ultimate-
ly they are finite and not a genuine
long term solution. Despite this,
the unfortunate truth is that as the
price of fossil fuels goes up, previ-
ously non cost effective reserves
become economically viable. Esti-
mates of fossil fuel depletion dates
suggest late 21st and even early
22nd century. But just because we
could burn it all, doesn’t mean that
we should and we are going to need
an alternative. Renewables are not
a realistic replacement for the base
load energy currently provided by
fossil fuels, and an attempt at this
would likely cause as much environ-
mental damage.
Most developed economies such
as the UK use fossil fuels for around
80% of their energy, and despite the
many, many summits organised to
take action against this, not one
has produced something even close
to resembling change. The Lon-
don Climate Forum coming up this
month will make all the right noises
no doubt, but with little substance.
However it needn’t be game over
yet. There are several solutions
which have been tried and tested in
the past, but have been closed down
for one reason or another. The 21st
century is the time that energy from
Thorium should, and needs, to be
taken seriously.
The technology aimed at utiliz-
ing Thorium initially emerged in
the 1950s and 60s in the US, under
the stewardship of Alvin Weinberg,
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
a facility that contributed to the
Manhattan project. The most im-
portant demonstration of this tech-
nology was undoubtedly the Molten
Salt Reactor Experiment, running
from 1965-1969. This experiment
used Uranium 233, which can eas-
ily bread from thorium, dissolved in
a fluoride lithium beryllium salt as
the reactor fuel.
Unfortunately, the US govern-
ment didn’t want energy- they
wanted weapons. This was the
Cold War, and the focus of nu-
clear research was geared towards
proliferation rather than a civilian
energy source. Milton Shaw, a for-
mer Navy soldier who was head of
the US Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC) shut the programme down,
despite the huge potential for abun-
dant energy in Weinberg’s creation.
40 years on, the reverberations of
Shaw’s decision are being keenly
felt by energy hungry consumers
around the world, whose prices are
sky high due to ever more scant re-
sources.
At the same time, conventional
nuclear power is going quickly
out of fashion with governments
around the world. After disasters
like Fukushima countries like Japan
and Germany have decided to scale
back their nuclear programmes: the
risk of meltdown has been deemed
unacceptable. Added to this, Ura-
nium 235, which is used in nuclear
reactors, is as rare as gold. Contrast
this with thorium, which is as com-
mon as lead, and you get some idea
of the incredible abundance of this
resource, which is currently treated
as a waste product.
Thorium energy has been largely
ignored since Weinberg’s initial
foray into the field, but in the last
decade or so, there has been re-
newed interest in the technology
as governments try to devise a way
to meet their citizens’ energy de-
mands.
Both India and China have re-
newed research into the field, due to
the necessity of energy in develop-
ing economies, but there has been
comparatively little interest in the
West, despite the pressing need for
clean, plentiful energy. Researchers
like Kirk Sorenson, the founder of
Flibe Energy, Inc have tried to kick
start the Thorium renaissance, but
as yet, few people are sitting up and
taking notice.
Governments have repeatedly
shown that they will not forgo eco-
nomic growth for environmental
considerations. The primary re-
quirement of a fossil fuel replace-
ment is therefore going to be the
ability to be profitable at the market
price. In order to warrant replac-
ing fossil fuels, it must also satisfy
the environmental criteria but ulti-
mately, this is a secondary consid-
eration. Most renewables do not
compete on price with fossil fuels
due to the diffuse energy sources
and additional infrastructure re-
quired. Thorium energy satisfies
both these issues. Not only is it a
clean, but more importantly it is a
market based, long term solution
that is available worldwide. Several
estimates have put it at the same
price and even cheaper than the
cheapest, dirtiest coal.
Molten salt technology possesses
many crucial advantages over con-
ventional nuclear power stations. It
operates at atmospheric pressure,

compared to ~100bar and higher
for LWRs. There is no risk of melt
down as the fuel is already liquid
and operates at around 600K. It also
produces just 1% of the radioactive
waste, much of which has second-
ary uses and due to its negative co-
efficient of reactivity; it is able to
respond quickly and accurately to
demand. Most importantly, a reac-
tor based on this type of technology
is walk away safe and under power
failure, it automatically puts itself
into a stable configuration without
the need for any human interven-
tion.
Crucially, the fissile material pro-
duced from thorium is unable to be
used in weaponry, and it is first and
foremost an economic source of
energy – the fact that it is environ-
mentally friendly is just an added
bonus.
Thorium’s time to shine has ar-
rived. The world needs new en-
ergy sources, without sacrificing
economic growth. The solution is
there, people just need to sit up and
take notice.
