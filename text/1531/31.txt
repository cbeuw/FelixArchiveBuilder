Philippa Skett on why feminists are their own worst enemies
Philippa Skett
Sexism at Imperial - really?
omen are in
a minority at
Imperial. It is
a simple truth.
Don’t bother to
argue, it is mathematically proven
and was stated as such in last week’s
article by Becky Lane, as only around
3 out of 10 people at Imperial con-
tain a vagina. If Imperial students
were balls in a bag, and there were
ten balls, only three of these would
be yellow (or any other colour to rep-
resent women) and the rest would
outnumber these signiﬁcantly – ob-
viously belittle them and then make
them feel inferior. For the angry
feminists out there, I am sorry to use
balls in this analogy, but the point
still stands (again, my apologies).
Regardless of being a minority,
obviously women should be treated
equally to men. We should not be
paid less in our jobs for the same
work and we should not stand for
attacks on us based on gender alone.
So Becky’s system to quantify sex-
ism at Imperial to approach sex-
ism that way is great, but women at
Imperial also need to do something
more than just sit back and write an
angry email every now and then.
They also need to realise when
something is a joke, and need to
stop reinforcing the stereotype that
females are oversensitive, emotional
bags of hormones. I genuinely think
that there are few truly sexist males
at Imperial – it is a cultural thing
– just like inadvertently insulting
someone’s sexuality by using “gay”
as an insult. I feel the same towards
homophobia; it is not common at all
at Imperial, but the use of gay as an
insult is. I am not saying this makes
it acceptable, or that people do not
still feel oﬀense, but I do think it is
a cultural framework that supports
this so called “banter”, not the truth.
However, sexism can reach whole
new lows outside the relatively in-
telligent community on campus
– which is why it still needs to be
combatted. Females nowadays need
to actively challenge those stereo-
types that are picked up on, even if
men may really believe them or not
and not just sit back and live up to
the idea that women are the weaker,
whinier sex.
I am not going to present my views
as valid just because I am a woman
too. Some women feel threatened by
men talking and giving opinions of
views in feminism because of some-
thing to do with “not understanding
the suppression,” or whatever, but I
feel it is so straightforward an issue
to approach even a man can contrib-
W
ute to this (a joke guys). It is about
women gaining positions of author-
ity and respect and therefore prov-
ing that they can hold themselves
just as well as men think they do
themselves. It is about striving to
work hard, doing your degree well
and proving you are not the weaker
sex, as opposed to sitting there and
moping about being called a little
girl. There are plenty of examples
of these women around campus
already, but Imperial is not a great
sample of the wider world.
Sexism comes in many forms, but
commanding respect as a woman
can only help narrow the gap and
reduce our supposed vulnerability
and susceptibility to such inequal-
ity. This is why this is something we
should take with us when we gradu-
ate and enter a world dominated by
males in power. It is not fair that we
should have to invest more energy
just to equal the playing ground, but
unfortunately life is never going to
be that fair, is it?
Women don’t dominate politics
or banking despite them having
the capacity to do so, which makes
people feel that they are suppressed
as a gender, but in reality, unless
there is a precise 50-50 split, there
always will be one gender more
present than the other. Why this
is rarely women then? Maybe it is
the pay gap, or “tradition”, but I am
afraid to say this may never go away
swiftly, no matter how many graphs
you make of it. Why not move away
from the computer, and stand up for
yourselves without shouting about
it?
Challenge the stereotypes directly,
work harder to overcome the com-
petition and ﬁll the big gun posi-
tions, then crack down on sexism
with this power advantage, along
with solid proof by just being there
that women can do it all too. Don’t
fulﬁl the stereotype that we are all
whining babies. I swear if some of
the more vocal feminists invested
more energy in doing this than just
complaining amongst themselves,
then maybe sexism would be less of
an issue than it is currently.
