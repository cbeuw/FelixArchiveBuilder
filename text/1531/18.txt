The image of Jack Nicholson leering
out from a hole in a door, his teeth
bared and his eyes manic, has gone
down as one of cinema’s most iconic
images. It perfectly conveys the un-
settling atmosphere which Stanley
Kubrick conjures up in his 1980 ﬁlm
The Shining. The ﬁlm has become in-
grained in our culture, and is often
used as a benchmark against which all
other horror ﬁlms can be compared.
However, this has not always been
the case; upon release it received a
luke-warm response, with critics call-
ing it “an overreaching, multi-levelled
botch” and describing Shelley Duvall’s
character as a “simpering, semi-re-
tarded hysteric”. How things change.
Today The Shining is widely recog-
nized as one of the greatest horror
ﬁlms of all time, and has been estab-
lished as a modern classic of cinema.
Last week saw the UK premier of the
US extended edition, which has never
been shown here before and includes
an extra half hour of footage, meaning
everyone now has the chance to see
this masterpiece on the big screen.
Based on a novel by Stephen King,
The Shining’s plot is a relatively simple
one: Jack Torrance, played by Jack Ni-
cholson, moves with his wife Wendy
(Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny
to Overlook Hotel, a lodge that they
agree to look after during the long
winter. Jack, a writer struggling with
writer’s block, hopes that the isola-
tion will help him ﬁnish his novel, but
Shelly is more preoccupied with Dan-
ny’s invisible friend Tony. Danny, it is
revealed, has some psychic abilities,
called ‘Shining’, making him sensitive
to the past horrors that occurred in
the hotel, centring around the myste-
rious Room 237. Brutal murders, el-
evators ﬁlled with blood, and ghostly
apparitions all make an appearance as
Jack is driven deeper and deeper into
psychosis. The majority of the lines
are given by Nicholson and Duvall,
who are simply superb, with Nichol-
son playing the psychotic Jack with a
gleeful enthusiasm. Duvall shines in
her role as Wendy, portraying a wom-
an on the edge, confused and terriﬁed;
she stumbles through the corridors of
the Overlook Hotel, pursued by her
husband, with a look of pure horror
on her face.
A large part of what makes The Shin-
ing so haunting is the set and the art
direction, overseen by Kubrick, who
was renowned for his methodical at-
tention for detail. Each frame is an
individual work of art, and the small-
est details in a scene take on a huge
importance. The Overlook Hotel has
an atmosphere all of its own, the vast,
sprawling lodge becoming a third cen-
tral character alongside Nicholson
and Duvall. Kubrick’s gift in the di-
rector’s chair comes across incredibly
strongly in this ﬁlm, and his direction
is breathtaking. He has taken the ba-
sic plot, and distorted it through his
camera’s lens into a unsettling psycho-
logical horror, which frequently toys
with the viewer, making them ques-
tion what is real and what isn’t. What
really lies behind the door of Room
237? And hasn’t Jack been to the hotel
before? These are questions that Ku-
brick leaves unanswered, allowing the
viewer to make their own mind up.
This ambiguity of The Shining is ex-
plored in the ﬁlm Room 237, a docu-
mentary released last month that ex-
plores diﬀerent theories behind the
ﬁlm. One commentator believes it is
actually about the genocide of Native
Americans, while another argues that
Kubrick is making a commentary on
the Holocaust. Such outlandish theo-
ries may seem extreme if it was for any
other ﬁlm, but The Shining is diﬀerent.
Kubrick’s obsession for precise details
means that nothing can be dismissed
in the ﬁlm; everything takes on a new
importance, making some of the theo-
ries very persuasive. This makes The
Shining a ﬁlm that deﬁnitely deserves
a second viewing, if not a third.
The experience of seeing this ﬁlm
in the cinema cannot be overstated.
While the new footage included in
the cut helps to ﬂesh out the ﬁlm
somewhat, the most exciting thing
about this release is that it allows us
to view the ﬁlm as Kubrick intended:
on the big screen, allowing the specta-
cle to completely envelop the viewer.
In the screening I went to there was
a chilling atmosphere in the theatre.
While the ﬁlm remains as ‘scary’ as it
was when I ﬁrst saw it on TV, seeing
it in the cinema allows the action to
become haunting, visceral, and truly
psychologically terrifying.
