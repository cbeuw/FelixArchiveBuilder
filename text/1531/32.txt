ave you been wrong
today? Have you failed
at basic logic at least
once since breakfast?
Have you propagated
a myth or notion that despite its spu-
riousness has persisted through lazi-
ness and avoidance of fact-checking?
Have you done your duty as a human
being and exercised your right as a
citizen?
Thousands of people are wrong eve-
ry day. You can ﬁnd them blabbering
on the tube, yakking in cafés and espe-
cially on the internet, where this func-
tion is held sacred, third only behind
cats and porn. Open any news website,
scroll to the comments section and
you will be greeted by heaps of mes-
sages of people who spar with fallacies
using the same skill that master fenc-
ers employ. But what you may think is
merely the noxious combination of an
unwarranted sense of entitlement, a
lack of proper education and way too
much free time, is in fact a proud ser-
vice indispensable to society.
Wrongness is not something that
everyone across history has been able
to aﬀord: until not too long ago, people
were punished and killed for kneeling
in front of the wrong monarch; in the
not-so-distant past people could’ve
found themselves on the burning side
of a stake for claiming that the Christ’s
left nostril hair was the wrong shade
of yellow while he was being cruciﬁed;
and in almost any age, you could be
persecuted if your skin was the wrong
colour, if you were born in the wrong
country, or if you simply looked at
someone in the wrong way.
But it is our right to be wrong. We
must have no fear in picking a candi-
date, an idea, a preference and hold-
ing it as right despite evidence to the
contrary. We must be able to claim
whichever band we prefer to be the
best without fear of repercussion, re-
gardless of actual measurable talent
or pleasantness of song. We must be
allowed to stick to our personal set of
beliefs even in the face of insurmount-
able evidence that proves us wrong.
Freedom of speech means that no
matter how inane, inaccurate and inar-
ticulate our thoughts get, we must be
able to stand by them and hold them
dear, because they are our thoughts,
and it is our prerogative to be wrong.
People died for this prerogative.
Wars were fought, tyrants deposed
and democracies established, so that
today you could express your opinion
on current issues without getting the
punch to the back of the head you so
richly deserve for being so demon-
strably wrong. And we’re all the bet-
ter because of it! We have enjoyed the
period of greatest peace, equality and
prosperity in the history of mankind
since we’ve all allowed ourselves to
be wrong. How could it not be? At-
tempting to punish everyone for their
wrongness cannot be done with our
H
The right to be wrong
meagre resources: too many people
are just too damn wrong for too much
of the time. It’s better to let them stay
in the error of their ways, and concen-
trate on technologies that allow them
to share fallacies with strangers from
across the globe or medical advances
that can make them live longer and
better, though they won’t know how.
Besides, wrong people provide in-
valuable services to the community:
they make smart people look good
by comparison; they put arguments
to the test; they spend a lot of money
if you know what to sell, angmongst
other things. And if everyone starts
thinking the wrong stuﬀ, and we’re
all wrong in some way, who can even
tell? If everyone’s opinion is incor-
rect, who can even ﬁgure out who’s
right? Apart from the smart people,
obviously: they know. But the masses,
the many who spend their lives in idle
chatter on forum boards and public
transportation, those who choose
who they’re going to vote in their
fever dreams and those who are eas-
ily confused by common sense, they
can all be wrong together, and in their
shared state their wrongness will
seem less so.
The next time you see someone
disagree with you despite his opin-
ion being blatantly mistaken, delete
that scathing multi-paragraph post
in which you denounce him and all
his ancestors as morons, and refrain
from trying to bash some sense into
him. He’s just expressing one of his
fundamental rights, perhaps the most
fundamental right of all: wrongness is
a prerogative of sentient beings, and
being able to be wrong is what makes
us human.

Sir,
I do believe I have come across a
(partial, at least) solution to both the
over congestion of the London Under-
ground and obesity within our fine
capital. I happened upon the idea
whilst commuting to college a few
mornings previous. As something of a
rarity, the tube was running on time,
however, as the doors opened before
me I was unable to board said train
due to an obese man of surely no less
than 140kg blocked entry.
It occurred to me that had that man
been of a healthier build I would have
been able to board the train. Moments
later – after a number of expletives
were muttered – I had that eureka
moment: ticket prices should be linked
to your size; not by height nor weight,
but a measurement of your widest
body part.
Not only would this make pricing
fairer by ensuring that someone taking
up twice the space pay twice as much
but I imagine it would give the more
corpulent commuters an incentive to
lose some weight.
I do concede that my idea might not
be perfect and may require further de-
velopment and refinement, but once
the minor details have been sorted I
have no doubt in the potential of the
scheme. It could even be applied to
other modes of transport!
Yours,
A disgruntled commuter
