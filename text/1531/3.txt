FRIDAY 16 NOVEMBER
Imperial RAG raised £11,276.14 at its
annual Poppy appeal on Thursday 8
November, putting it over a ﬁfth of the
way to reaching its target of £50,000
this year. This brings their total for
the year to £17574.18, according to
the counter on RAG’s website. How-
ever, when accounting for funds not
currently shown on the website, it is
£18,574. Although by the time this
goes to print the website may be up-
dated. This ﬁgure is above the total
raised throughout the entire year last
year.
Money has been raised through a
variety of events. For Remembrance
Day, Poppy Sales and the sale of wrist-
bands to The Poppy Appeal After Par-
ty at Piccadilly Institute.
This year’s Poppy Appeal went out
to 18 tube stations across Zone 1 and
saw a total of 93 volunteers head out in
three shifts thorough out the day. The
biggest individual collection of the
day came from Phil Morris from the
RCSU who raised £ 489.84 at Kings
Cross. In terms of faculty collections,
however, it was the CGCU that came
out top, raising a total of £4170.60.
All Participants in the appeal had
free entry to the RAG after-party for
which tickets were also sold at £5 a
piece. It seemed to have been popular
with students; ticket sales alone raised
£655.
The 24 Hour Row came to an end at
1pm on Wednesday 14 November, as
indicated when the bells on Queen’s
Tower rang out. The event, which was
held on Queen’s Lawn, began on Tues-
day 13 November, and saw students
row through the night to raise money
for BBC Children in Need. Any gaps
had to be ﬁlled in by those organising
the event.
Each participant had a 20-minute
long slot on a rowing machine housed
under the tent just outside the Cen-
tral Library. Prizes for students who
rowed the furthest were picked up by
Hugh Wilman among the men and
Rosie Davies among the women.
Sandwiches from Pret A Manger
were on hand for anyone taking the
nightshift. RAG members in yellow
shirts manning the tent throughout
the night.
While RAG doesn’t have a long-
term schedule of events for the year
at the moment. The team are cur-
rently planning events on a per event
basis. However, plans for the annual
Jailbreak are under way and there will

University Drinking and Sex League Tables released
Student Beans, the self-proclaimed
“essential part of student life”, released
the results of their Student Drink-
ing University League Table 2012 last
week. They also released their Sex
League Table over the summer. In
both surveys, Imperial were towards
the bottom.
To those of you who used Felix’s own
Felix Sex Survey to bemoan the state of
your lives at Imperial (look out for this
year’s Sex Survey later on in the year),
this can be an opportunity to think of
those less fortunate than even your-
selves in these wintery months. Also,
as this is a fair and balanced news ar-
ticle, this has got nothing on the Felix
survey. There’s not even a question on
the subject of alternative library usage!
In the drinking survey Imperial Stu-
dents rank closer to the bottom of the
list than the top, at 56th place out of
74. According to Student Beans the av-
erage Imperial student consumes 16.4
units of alcohol. This is below the NHS
guidelines for men and is borderline
for women (the “too much” guidelines
Niall Jeffrey Reporter rather than sticking to your ﬁve-a-
day). Of course young adults may be
more susceptible to alcohol damage
and this isn’t oﬃcial advice, so don’t
take this as an excuse to drink more.
The survey has some questionable
aspects. Imperial consumption has
apparently shot up from 11 units per-
week from last year’s survey by an ex-
tra 5 units per week. This would mean
that in 12 months the average alcohol
intake at Imperial has risen by over
35%, although it is possible that fresh-
ers have “gone wild”.
More likely is that there are failings
in the Beans’ methodology. A contrib-
utory factor may be surveying “stu-
dents who drink alcohol”, thus exclud-
ing large numbers of teetotallers. The
survey, however, does place Queen’s
University Belfast top of drinking. You
can decide for yourself what’s going on
there.
Let’s talk about sex baby. In the
Beans’ Sex League Imperial places
77th out of 101. According to the table
Imperial Students have had 2.88 sex-
ual partners since starting university.
With absolutely no description at all
on how fractions of people are having
sex with each other.
Imperial’s relatively low position
will generally not surprise readers and
invoke the ominously old joke about
“the ratio”. But the revelation that
Imperial ranks higher than 24 other
universities surveyed may raise some
eyebrows whose owners thought they
were in the bottom of the student pile.
The Sex League does make an analo-
gous mistake to the Drinking League’s
only surveying alcohol drinkers. Only
“4,656 sexually active” students were
questioned, which is a low proportion
of the total student population. With
last year’s Felix Sex Survey revealing
that 18% of the student body have not
had sex, the Student Beans’ survey is
clearly skewed in favour of boosting
Imperial up the table.
Thus there are suﬃcient ﬂaws to
make the bemoaners happy not to be
happy again with this new incarna-
tion of the Sex League (a phrase that is
beginning to sound like a band of oﬀ-
colour superheroes).
In related news, UCL ranked 37th
out of 101 with student sex frequency.
Jammy buggers. Shame they can’t rep-
licate that form in academic rankings.
Also in the news...
also be the BIG Bake sale on the 23
November. Additionally it’s Movem-
ber eﬀorts have so far raised £2000
(see centrefold).
David Goldsmith, RAG Chair,
when asked for comment, said that
RAG was doing really well and that
he “didn’t expect the turnout” it had
received at the events that they have
held this year. He says there are plans
to expand RAG and work with Clubs,
Societies & Projects and to hold hall
competitions in the future. Goldsmith
repeatedly mentioned that RAG was
doing “ridiculously well” and that it is
going to “make tonnes of money”.
