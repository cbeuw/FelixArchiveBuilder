AMS album of the week
Crystal Castles: (III)
Crystal Castles’ rise to fame has undoubtedly been
rapid. From their debut album (I) in 2008 to their
latest release (III), the band has attracted a huge
fan base. They went from playing in dingy, under-
groundbarstoplayingReadingthisyear.
With this rise, the band has matured. Their new
album (III) is so much different yet so similar to
their previous two albums. Whereas (I) has a more
friendly feel and a simpler production value, (II)
saw the band turn towards more harsh sounds,
deeper bass and louder vocals. In essence, (III) can be seen as an extension of their
previouswork—westillhavesomecomputerizedvocalsandsimplebutstrongdrum

Wheninterviewedaboutit,Alicehascitedoppressionanddystopiaasmajorinflu-
ences for the album. We hear this in songs like the opener “Plague” and “Kerosene”.
Both are bold and aggressive. There’s the slow build up of fading tones, vocals, then
the drum beat and finally the huge synth sound, which is so characteristic of Crys-
tal Castles’ songs. “Affection” keeps the big sound but slows down the beat, it’s an
emotional song and in my opinion the best on the album. After ‘Affection’ you are
plunged back into classic ‘Castles with the likes of “Insulin”, “Mercenary” and “Sad
Eyes”.Anoisy,electronicmixofheavilycompressedvocalsanddarkdrums.
The album closes with “Child I Will Hurt You”. I don’t think I can adequately de-
scribeithere,soIshalljustsaythatit’sbeautiful.
Throughout the album, you hear similarities between other electronic artists
though, it’s almost as if (III) is a bit too late on the scene. Artists like Grimes and Pu-
rity Ring have perfected that big, dirty dance sound and it feels like Crystal Castles
arejustcatchingup.
There’s much to like about (III). It’s almost a perfect album, the only qualm is that
they’velostsomeoftheuniqueedgetheyoncehad.(III)doesn’thaveiconictrackslike

IC Radio, one of the oldest and
coolest student stations in the
country, is the official sound of Im-
perial College London. Broadcast-
ing and streaming in crystal quality
from icradio.com, we are on air 24
hours a day, alternating between
live shows and playlists from our
huge music library.
Anything and everything goes on
air there’s Best Foot Forward, your
weekly dose of the best new music
and underground artists while The
Happy Hour, hosted by happy Mi-
chael, is an hour of random fun and
LOLz! accompanied by the latest
pop/chart tunes. Mad Craic is an
award winning, highly entertaining
blend of banter and music from the
astonishingly Irish Aislinn Hayes
and the wonderfully English Craig
Woods while over on Matt Colvin’s
The Sound of Success the worlds
of game shows and radio chaoti-
cally collide as two contestants bat-
tle it out over 58 minutes to hear
their song of choice. On the Ec-
lectic Ectoplasm! Eamonn plays a
bit of everything and anything with
a co-presenter adding their weird
and wonderful music taste into the
mix every other week. Then there’s
the Anime Hour, making your life
sound as epic as anime, one song at
a time and the National Student
Radio Chart Show, a chart show
hosted each week by a different stu-
dent station and networked across
the UK. The AMS Night Bus sees
the return of the Alternative Music
Society to IC Radio while Mod-
cast features British Mod, Ska and
Northern Soul of past and present.
Prime Cuts offers up your weekly
serving of grime, hip-hop and any
deep dark tunes in between, then
there’s the wildly eclectic Out-
house: pretentious music, verbose
conversation and a fine choice in
anecdotes, all related to ATP. What
more could you want? If you’re a fan
of rock in all of its forms, tune in
for music and chat with Tom and
Matt on Rock and Roll Ain’t Noise
Pollution. Then for admirers of
modern electronic and bass music
there’s Touch Bass and Bass Case
to name just a couple and Through
the Looking Glass is a chat show
hosted by Giulia, a lover of strong
(VERY STRONG) opinions, inap-
propriate behaviour and ridiculous
outfits.
We have over 100 different shows
in addition to a back catalogue of
our very own ‘live lounge’ style re-
cordings all available both live and
on a listen again service so there’s
something for everyone. Head on
over to icradio.com and get listen-
ing!
