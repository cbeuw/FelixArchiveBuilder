es, dear readers, I have
recently discovered the
world of wireless head-
phones. Two weeks
ago, bored and not
feeling like untangling my normal
headphones, I decided to peruse
the various stores of the internet,
to discover if the World Wide Web
had anything to tickle my fancy. Lo
and behold, on Amazon, I stum-
bled upon a whole array of Blue-
tooth headphones, and, perhaps
more surprisingly, very (and I mean
VERY) attractively priced ones.
I had previously visited an Apple
store (to check out the iPad mini)
and had seen headphones priced at
£300, so to see these puppies be-
ing displayed from £20 to £70 was
really astounding! Anyway, before
I launch into my review of one of
these headphones that I purchased,
I will firstly talk pros and cons of
Bluetooth/wireless headphones in
general.
So what are all the advantages of
Bluetooth headphones? Well the
fact that you don’t actually have a
wire is beneficial in many different
ways. The lack of a wire also im-
plies a lack of consequent tangles,
so when you decide to listen to mu-
sic you just pull your headphones
out of your bag and you’re ready to
go! Also, when I have headphones/
earphones, the wire tends to be the
weakest link of the whole thing, and
thus usually breaks first. When the
wire is faulty it impairs the whole
listening experience, for example
only being able to hear from one
ear sucks. With the Bluetooth stuff,
there is no cable to be the weak-
est link, and therefore the
thing as a whole
is less likely
to break.
If, like me, you lis-
ten to lots of mu-
sic that requires a
certain degree of head
banging, then the wire-
less environment of the
Bluetooth headphone will
allow you the freedom to
head bang to your heart’s
content! Lastly, but cer-
tainly not least, of the
pros is the fact
that these de-
vices have a
range of
a b o u t
5-10m. So if you are at home, listen-
ing off your laptop with your head-
phones, you can easily just stand
up, get that can of Red Bull [Felix
in no way endorses Red Bull over its
imitators] from the fridge, all with-
out the hassle of losing your music.
So with all these pros, you must
be thinking, hey, what’s the catch?
Well, battery drain is about the big-
gest con if you are on the move. Us-
ers have experienced about double
the battery usage on their smart-
phone when they listen to music
with their Bluetooth headphones.
So if you’re someone who uses your
smartphone a lot, as well as not hav-
ing much access to a charger all day,
wires may still be the best option for
you. There are also concerns about
safety, as you are open to people
taking control. You are pretty much
opening up your device to others
who also have Bluetooth, although
this issue has largely been resolved
in recent years. Some people also
seem to think that the sound quality
suffers with Bluetooth headphones.
While this may be true if you have
your phone 10 meters away, if it’s
in your pocket/bag/immediate area
it sounds IDENTICAL to a wired
connection of the same price range.
So why are Bluetooth head-
phones/earphones such a rare com-
modity? Well, I believe that the
widespread usage of these devices
has been curbed by the expecta-
tion that they are really expensive!
That’s why I am here to review my
own £22.97 headphones; to see if
good headphones really do cost a
lot, or if bargain hunters can also
win!
After I had seen the Bluetooth
stereo Headset SX-907 on
Amazon, I believed it
was too good to be
t r u e . I mean, how can
t h e s e things look so
nice, do what they do
and cost un- der £25?
After lots of d e b a t i n g
I decided to s p l a s h

cess of ripping apart the wrapping.
As I got to the actual box, I was
slightly disappointed. The picture
on the outside had obviously been
photoshopped (badly) to include
the headphones, and it all looked
kind of cheap. Not only that, but
there was no user manual, and the
headphones just lay in the package.
This was not the way I expected my
Bluetooth headphone relationship
to start.
However, things seemed to look
up from there. The headphones
weren’t exactly beautiful (mostly
plastic), but for 20 quid I hadn’t
expected them to look great. I
turned them on, a beep greeted me
and, nicely enough, they were fully
charged. This was signalled by the
light on the side of the headphones.
This light is the only way that the
headphones can communicate with
you, so this little lightbulb has many
different variations (red, blue, alter-
nating, it does it all), which is ex-
tremely bright. Without the manu-
al it took me a while to pair these
babies with my phone, but after a
while I got it and it was surprisingly
painless, with a nice little beep to
confirm I had paired successfully.
Then came the big test, the mu-
sic. I had chosen a set playlist to test
everything on my new headphones,
and started out with “Numb/En-
core” by Jay-Z and Linkin Park,
to be the virgin track. The first
beat blew me away. For £20, I was
hearing some of the best quality I
had EVER heard, and all wireless
to boot. Also, they weren’t too un-
comfortable, and blocked out sur-
rounding sound very nicely. There
are buttons on the sides of the
headphones, allowing you to do the
elementary functions you would
normally do on your phone. The
volume/fast forward button is a
bit haphazard though, and I don’t
think I will be using it much as it is
hard to use properly without mak-
ing mistakes. These headphones
also have a rudimentary mic, so
right away I started a phone call.
The quality of the audio was good
enough, but the mic was not up to
scratch: it was not transmitting well
enough. So I guess receiving and
making phone calls are not on the
agenda. As I turned off the music
I noticed a quiet beeping/“weird
machine” sound in the right head-
phone. Although this does not real-
ly disturb me, as my music drowned
out this noise, for people who listen
to music at lower volumes, this may
be irritating.
A week after purchasing these
puppies, I have fully charged them
once (still going strong) and have
used them in every conceivable
place (Library, train, walking etc).
They’ve passed all of the tests with
flying colours, using about 6% of
my phone battery per hour. This is
quite good as it means that I have
about 10 hours of listening to mu-
sic! I’ve paired them to phones,

tablets and computers and it has all
worked flawlessly. I even managed
to use them while my laptop was
on the other side of my apartment
(with walls in between). Annoy-
ingly though, I have found that the
buttons on the side of the headset
are very easily pressed, so I keep
pausing in songs, but that may just
be me. Also, while studying in the
Library, I did get the complaint
that my headphones were too loud.
While this may not be a con for my-
self per se, it might annoy others.
My last con for these headphones
is that, because they use plastic for
everything, wearing these things for
an hour did make my ears hurt, as
well as my scalp feel very uncom-
fortable.
All in all, for the price that I got
these headphones, they are excel-
lent and I give them a very impres-
sive 9/10. However, considering the
fact that they deliver in such spec-
tacular manner, my question is why
don’t many more people have these
things?
