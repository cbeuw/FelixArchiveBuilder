The usual Christmas tour
round London's West End led to
Leicester Square. A large crowd
outside a cinema seemed a ready-
made audience of potential half-
crowns. However it turned out
that Princess Margaret was at a
premier there. A half-hour row
with a police inspector ensued,
because we had the wrong per-
mits. In spite of the Vice-Presi-
dent's experience with the police,
he bumbled out of it somehow.
Some Minesmen were later seen
fouling the Science Museum, and
unfortunately our collection was
confused with theirs. Total was
about £50.

DEBATES
Too few people come to a de-
bate with the intention of speak-
ing themselves. With no speeches
from the floor, it would cease to
be debate and the audience might
just as well watch a one-act play
at lunch-time.
Heckling has its value, for it
need not be destructive, but was
almost non-existent last term. The
exception was the Union Debate,
the last of term which though the
poorest attended (only 33 came),
was by far the best. The fact that
the motion was somewhat abstract
has been suggested as a reason
for its poor attendance. It is with
this in mind that the following
three motions have been chosen
for the Inter-Collegiate Compe-
tition: —
" That Columbus went too far."
" That nightcaps are more satis-
factory than knighthoods."
" That Ireland owes more to
Guiness than to St. Patrick."
SPRING PROGRAMME
The Debating Society's pro-
gramme for this term includes an
evening debate on February 2
when Edward Gardner, Q.C.,
M.P., will propose that the death
penalty be retained. Dr. David
Kerr, M.P., will oppose.
Anne Heywood (the 1961 Peter
Pan, will propose on February
18th "That this house believes
in fairies ").
The Rt. Hon. Enoch Powell.
M.P., a former Conservative
Minister of Health will propose
on March 18th, the next Union
Debate., the motion of "No confi-
dence in her Majesty's Govern-
ment.
At the end of February, a team
of six will take part in four de-
bates in Belfast, Dublin and Cork.
The places have not yet been
filled, and before they are finally
decided, the many able people,
who have so far not spoken at
debates this year must be heard.
Do come to speak—and show
that you are a candidate for this
tour.

President of Debates.)
attraction; she should be on the
road by the end of this term
though, if Bruce Copper can get
some more paint-stripper. Volun-
teers welcome at the garage
behind Chemistry on Wednesday
afternoons.
Union Meeting
The first one will be on Thurs-
day, February 9th unless I.C.
have one, in which case it won't.
Tramp's Ball
To be more exact, a scruffy
jeans-and-sweater-type party will
be held at an undisclosed teacher's
training college (for women), on
Friday February 12th. Coaches
go and come, and tickets will be
on sale from year reps, in due
course. It is hoped to have the
Wayfarers there.

In recent years the musical
scene at IC has been incomplete.
This year, however, the situation
is being rectified by the inclusion
of a symphony concert in the
year's programme.
Amateur orchestral produc-
tions have a notorious reputation,
probably founded on the me-
mories of the school strings. This
is certainly not justified at IC as
will be demonstrated on Feb". 1st
when the college orchestra will be
performing symphonies by Mo-
zart and Beethoven.
The. Mozart symphony No. 29
is* a lesser known but delightful
example from this great Classical
composer. In contrast the Beet-
hoven symphonv No. 8 is an ac-
cepted masterpiece of the Ro-
mantic period.
To complete the evening we are
playing Vaughan Williams over-
ture The Wasps " and an un-
usual contemporary work scored
for 30 percussion instruments, a
rare combination!
It is hoped that all musically
minded members of college will
support this function at 8 p.m. in
the Concert Hall. TicI.Jts will be
available from members, of the
orchestra and in the Union.
Electronic engineers, designers, system planners and
manufacturers of aeronautical, broadcasting,
communications and maritime radio equipment,
television, radar and navigational aids
on land, at sea and in the air.
