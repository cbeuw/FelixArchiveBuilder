PROJECTED PLAY
A novel idea has been con-
ceived by Dr. Cameron and
others—a revival of a type of
play, a Masque, that has not
been performed for over 200
years.
The Masque, entitled " News
from the Moon," and written by
Ben Johnson, was first performed
before King James I. It consists
of a short play, into which is in-
terwoven Geometric Dancing,"
(a combination of Ballet and
Morris Dancing.) There will be
a professional producer/choreo-
grapher, and a professional
orchestra. Music might have to
be specially written.
The idea is that the play be
part of The London Festival, with
six performances around July
15th. Although this is after the
end of the Summer term, more
volunteers are welcome; at least
25 people are required, and it
will^probably be a.more attractive
proposition to P.G.'s, since it in-
volves one evening a week at
present (Monday), and probably
more nearer the performance.
All interested should see Dr.
Cameron as soon as possible,
since rehearsals have already
started.
The play will be expensive to
produce (£1,000-£1,500), and it
is hoped that external backing
will be forthcoming. Nowhere has
yet been found to present it, al-
though The Goldsmiths' Hall has
been rumoured. As part of the
London Festival, it would particu-
larly attract the tourist trade;
tickets will be expensive and their
profits will go to charity.
Each performance will be fol-
lowed by a champagne party, and
it is hoped that the audience will
wear costumes of the King James
period. Ladies will be planted in
the audience, to be invited onto
the stage to take part in the play.
This is an imaginative and in-
teresting venture, and is worthy
of support.
MAMMOTH
BLOOD SPLASH
The National Blood Trans-
fusion Service will be visiting
this college on Mon., Tues.,
Weds. 8, 9, 10th Feb.
This is a special visit for IC
because there is at present a
shortage of blood, and the NBTS
have especially contacted us to
help swell their depleted stocks.
Last year the volunteers numbered
332. This year a target has been
set of 500. This is a considerable
increase and needs the co-opera-
tion and assistance of everyone.
New volunteers please fill in a
form to be found in I.C. Union
(or ring 2859 Int). A new method,
introduced here on their last visit
makes blood donating absolutely
painless. Only 2/3 of a pint >
s
taken and this takes a very short
time to make up.
Please visit the timetable in the
Union and reserve a time to do-
nate your mood. Any enquiries
requests, more details, leaflets,
posters, etc., ring Int. 2859 for
prompt attention.
P.S. Jokes about the scarcity of
mammoth blood are already
stale.

ABERYSTWYTH HOCKEY
J RIOT
85 students at Aberystwyth
were recently fined a total of £170
after wrecking two hotels in Ban-
gor. The trouble, which involved
extensive damage to the plumb-

at a sports meeting.

After a brilliant series of rag

BANKRUPTCY FOR L.S.E.
DANCE ORGANISATION
A bankruptcy action is almost
certain for Max Williams who
organised L.S.E's £450 - loss
dance. He was not authorised by
London Students Carnival Ltd.
and consequently faces the entire
loss himself.
MARXISTS URGE
PERVERSION
At a meeting of L.S.E's Marx-
ist Society their chief exponent of
Marx, speaking on the family, ad-
vocated the abolition of the family
and its replacement by a National
Sex Service to supply everyone
with sex "from puberty to death."
He added that homosexuality,
perversions and pornography are
progressive tendencies" and
should be used to undermine the
mystique of the family. He con-
cluded by calling for the en-
couragement of reciprocal per-
versions.
DAYS OF SOLIDARITY
If one observed all the davs of
solidarity suggested by Inter-
national Union of Students, it
ought to be possible not to work
In aid of the Notting Hill Housing Trust.
Midnight, Saturday 15th, may
well see the. end of the 6th I.C.
Carnival, and, we hope, the most
successful one to date. The
Union meeting at which the
charity was selected is over, the
average I.C. student settles com-
fortably back and forgets all
about Carnival until the envelope
with a packet of raffle tickets, and
the letter headed, " E: ar fellow
student," turns up in his letter
rack. A great deal of work has
to be put in, however, to make
Carnival possible, and there is
always room for more help.
What Will Carnival do for r'uu ?
This year, there will be an in-
crease in activities, not only in
Carnival week, 10th-15th May,
but also before it. By the time
this issue comes out, the first of
the Carnival lunches will have
been held, with 11 more to follow.
If you are regular snack-bar
eaters, why not come to the Con-
cert Hall in the Union on Fridays
from 12-2, where we can guaran-
ing week will see more entertain-
ments put on for you than we
have ever had before, culminating
with the procession, fete and Car-
nival Ball on Saturday.
We made a total of about
£2,000 last year, and this year we
can surely do better. Kensington
is a large borough! B U T WE
MUST H A V E YOUR HELP.
If every student in the College
vvent out once and collected 5/-
only; this would be about £750 to
the Carnival, with no expenses to
pay. This term, apart from a
Commando raid, (details later),
we hope to organize a door to
door collection in Kensington—a
similar collection got the Notting
Hill Housing Trust £2,000 in one
day. If you want to help in any
way, the Carnival Office is open
in the Union, Committee Room
A at lunch times, and a commit-
tee member will be there to an-
swer your questions and enlist
your aid. If you have desires to
kidnap the Duke of Edinburgh
tee faster service than Mooney,
and what we hope will be a better
snack lunch as well?
Three weeks before the end of
term distribution of the raffle
tickets should start. This year
let us make a special effort to sell
them-the raffle is being organized
on the same lines as last year,
with fifty prizes to be won. If
we could sell 9,000 tickets, we
would make a profit on the raffle
alone of over £1,200.
Carnival week and the preced-
or paint the Albert Hall green,
you are wanted as a Carnival
Commando, and at least some of
your evenings will not be idle.
Working parties are going out
and helping the Trust and these
again need manpower; so, if you
want to work off excess energy,
here is a way to do it.
WITH YOUR HELP THIS
COULD BE THE BEST CAR-
NIVAL I.C. HAS EVER HAD.
COME AND SEE US AT THE
CARNIVAL OFFICE'.
H U G H AINSLEY
at all. There is a day of solidarity
for nearly every day of 1965.
They include a day of solidarity
with the people and youth of
North Kalimantan fighting for
their liberation, a week of soli-
darity with Guatemala (why?)
and a day of solidarity with the
youth and people of South Africa
and Southern Rhodesia ^fighting
against colonialism, fascism and
racialism.
