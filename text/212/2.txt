LOCHNESS
M O N S T E R
18th January.
Monsters have been seen by hunters in Iceland, Moscow univer-
sity teams in Siberia and zoologists on Lake Tanganyika, but none
so often as the Highland's own. Indeed, Mr. Richard Fitter^ who
makes monsters his business, is convinced of the existence of the
monster.
A team led by David James, D.Sc, are going to investigate foi
the third time this year with multiple lens cameras and such. They
haven't so far got close enough to get any effective photographs,
but the evidence Mr. Fitter' produced certainly seemed convincing':
As far back as 1726 when the first road was built around the loch,
to fifteen sighting last year—it couldn't be the Scottish moonlight.
Our friends around the corner in Cromwell Road won't have any-
thing to do with it, so how about an IC representative for Dr. James'
expedition ? Openings for keen monster fans with fearless hawk
eyes.

Every Sunday morning you can enjoy the razor-
sharp theatre reviews of Penelope Gilliatt. She
brings a fresh, astringent intelligence to the
job. You may disagree violently with what she
says but you will relish the style with which
she says it. If you are tired of the jaded, pre-
dictable opinions of the establishment critics,
begin next Sunday morning with Gilliatt. You'll
find it a refreshing change.

Mr. R. M. Ogorkiewicz (lec-
turer in Mech. Eng.), on his pet
hobby tanks, gave an interesting
historical discourse on the origin
of the armoured fighting vehicle.
From Assyrian chariots and Alex-
andrian legions to the later bat-
tering rams, many types of
wheeled vehicle were used in
battle.
Voltaire in 1757 suggested such
vehicles as a means for honest
men to protect themselves. How-
ever, as his legs were not strong
enough to carry a personalized
tank, it was not until the advent
of steam power that in 1899 the
first gun was mounted on a
quadricycle.
Sir Winston Churchill was the
person who associated H . G.
Wells with the tank, but it was in
fact B. J. Diplock who in 1910
designed the first tracked vehicle.
Wars accelerated development,
but unfortunately tanks are noj
the monopoly ,of honest men, so
we aren't much better off than the
Assyrians or Voltaire.

FILM SOCIETY
Truffant
and Bentine
On 5th February the Film so-
ciety will be showing "Les Quatre
Cents Coups" the first feature film
of Francois Truffant, the director
of " Jules et Jim " and the recent
" L a Peau Douce." This film,
which won a best direction prize
at Cannes, tells of the tragic but
very ordinary misunderstandings
and mischiefs which push and tug
a small boy and his parents to-
wards the bleak and desolate end-
ing of the reform school.
Also showing is the biographic
film "The Do-It-Yourse'f Car-
toon Kit." Directed by Bob
Godfrey, this short film features
the voice of Michael Bentine.
If it exists...
Masked figures creeping up
Southside ventilation duct. In-
explicable lights seen, in Princes'
Gardens at the dead of night.
Strange sounds from Beit Hall
Basement. Illegible small-ads
in Felix.
Rumours have been spreading
that these mysterious portents
are the stirrings of I.C.'s most
secret society, the W . . den
H . . se (Jul).
This club was formed to pro-
mote the borrowing of other Col-
lege's mascots and getting stunts
for Carnival. This latter is now
under separate management as
the Carnival Commandoes, al-
though in close co-operation with
the club, and the club now has
responsibility for manufacture
and keeping of M I K E the I.C.
mascot.
Construction work is now in
progress on M I K E although we
cannot yet venture a completion
date, and several plans are afoot
for relieving several Colleges of
several mascots. If you want to
participate in some harmless en-
joyment, or help with some very
tricky construction problems
please contact one of the follow-

STUDENT OFFICERS
Many students have no idea
about the functions performed by
many of the Union Officers.
Felix, this term, intends to rectify
this matter by bringing you a
series on "The Functions of
Union Officers."
To start the ball rolling we
have a short resum6 of the work
done by Complaints Officers.
The complaints officers are
Adrian Fletcher (Beit 89) and
Pete Walton (Selkirk 678).
Their job is to ensure that
Mooney sees the Complaints book
regularly and deals with com-
plaints satisfactorily.
However their success is limited
because, nearly all the complaints
are individual and will not occur
again. This form of complaint is
best dealt with on the spot, by
one of the serving ladies. However
there is yet time for them to
justify their existence if you can
think of some constructive sug-
gestions to put in the book. After
all it is a suggestion book and not
a Complaints book.
Sadly we have to report that
Mr. (Yogi) Bishop's (President of
C. & G.) private internal tele-
phone has been removed from his
room by the College Authorities.
This does raise the point, that
perhaps some Union Officials*
tasks would be made easier if
they had a private 'phone.
A member of Felix Start' re-
cently made his debut on the
piano at the " Prince of Wales,"
Holland Park. Supporters are
welcome any Friday, Saturday or
Sunday evening.
