D E V E L O P M E N T In the next 20 years the telephone
system, which at present connects nearly nine million
instruments, is likely to double in size and the range
of services will expand considerably. This involves'
many problems: the exploitation of the results of
research to bring into service such things as loud'
speaking and press-button telephones, electronic
exchanges, data transmission links and satellite com-
munications; the design and provision of telephone
exchanges and amplifier and radio stations, and also of
cables (underground and undersea) and microwave
radio links.
