FOLK CONCERT
SEEGER COMES TO I.C.
IC Folk Song Club's first attempt at a full-scale concert on
Tuesday, 19th January, in the Concert Hall, was an unprecedented
success. Two of the leading exponents of American Old Time Country
and Bluegrass Music, Mike Seeger and Bill Clifton, were the stars
of a show packed with entertaining songs.
Mike Seeger's virtuosity as a musician astounded the nearly
400-strong audience, showing himself to be master of guitar, banjo,
autoharp, harmonica and riddle. The brother of Peggy Seeger, who
was here last term, and half-brother of Pete Seeger, was well worth
waiting for until the second-half.
STRONG SUPPORT
But this does not mean to say
that the rest of the bill was poor.
Far from it—the Wayfarers main-
tained the usual high standard
and Bill- Clifton and the Echo
Mountain Boys gave performan-
ces easily the equal of their ap-
pearances here last October. Ivor
Grayson-Smith was a new and
instant success, and all four acts
ably built up the atmosphere—a
difficult feat in a room the size of
the Concert Hall.
Song-writer Dave Golder made
a surprise appearance with his
own highly original material and
was followed by Colin Bradford
adding traditional English songs.
FITTING CLIMAX
Without a doubt the highlight
of the evening was where it
should be—at the end. For half-
an-hour Bill and Mike came to-
gether to give a beautifully im-
provised session (they hadn't
played together for 18 months)
with an impressive array of songs
and instruments and interspersed
with highly amusing banter.
The evening's entertainment
was a truly encouraging start to
the first term or organised mid-
week entertainment under the
auspices of the Jazz and Folk
Song Clubs.

SENNET has had another
change of editor! Jo Roll suc-
ceeded in surviving only one issue
before being dismissed last week
for failing to eliminate sensation-
alism—the article that particu-
larly led to her downfall was the
front page " exposee " on drug-
addiction in London University.
THE
COOL
COLUMN
Like, there's Balls, Dances and
Hops—and then you get to
Stomps; but man, they're some-
thin' else. The scene is Wednes-
days in, this crazy wooden pad,
and there's swinging wall-to-wall
Jazz.
Some'guys standin' up there
givin it out real hot and rocking,
and then they all leave with their
horns and things, and some more
guys corne on the stand and make
it cool. And there's these dolls
around blowing out candles to
make it dark; and dancin' and
things.
Man, these Southside Stomps
are really somethin'. . . like when
you're there you'refloatinghigh.
And everyone is hip, like some
are dancing or just standing there,
and some are talking and drink-
ing and it's a gas. Man, I just
can't wait for a second shot . . .
crazy, like it's tonight, so make
the scene.
