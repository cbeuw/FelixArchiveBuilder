Rare Defeat
CUP M A T C H
Due to a water-logged ground
last Wednesday's U.L. Cup
Match against U.C. has been re-
arranged for TO-DAY.
Free coaches will leave the
Union at 1 p.m.
On Saturday, 16th January,
Cardiff Arms Park proved to be a
stronger attraction than Esh^r,
where I.C., with a weakened team
suffered a rare defeat from the
Cardinals. Despite the prevailing
weather conditions the pitch was
in good shape and in the first ex-
changes the ball was thrown
about quite freely
After sustaining a spell of Esher
pressure, a quick heel from a.
loose scrum produced an overlap
and Riley, taking the ball in his
stride crashed over for his 22nd
try of the season. I.C.'s lead,
however, was short-lived. Slack
play at the back of the line
allowed the Esher open-side to
take the ball and score under the
pist5. The visitors were then
subj.cted to strong Esher attacks
and were 13-3 down at half-time.
With the wind behind them,
I.C. started the second half in
Storming fashion, only to be a Sandhurst move is well covered by I.C. in their game on January 23rd.
driven back by good touch kick-
ing. Despite a converted try by
Weisner, Esher eruily contained
the " Imps " and tlie 5 point dif-
ference remained until the end.
All in all, Saturday was not a

TROUBLES
I.C. First Hockey team played
three matches in the first week of
term without a single win. How-
ever, two games resulted in
draws, and the X I show signs of
regaining form
On Wed., Jan. 13th, I.C. were
beaten by an extremely competent
Kingston Grammar School side.
Although one goal in five made
the difference, there was no dis-
guising the fact that the light-
weight schoolboys managed far
better in the appalling conditions.
Their three goals came a little too
easily. However, Hough scored
a fine goal towards the end, and
in the last five minutes Stenning
also scored.
The folliwing Saturday the team
drew 3-3 with Keble College at
Oxford. In spite of a bad start
I.C. led 2-1 at half-time. Soon
afterwards, McKenzie scored his
second goal of the match with an
excellent driving shot. At this
point the team relaxed allowing
Keble to score twice in the last
fifteen minutes.
The next game was a goal-less
draw with Epsom Gypsies at
Harlington. The match was es-
sentially defensive, and it was
gratifying to see goalkeeper Need-
ham back in form.

F R E E COACHES.
Scientists and engineers: research workers in new fields of human
knowledge: and practical men to direct huge engineering enter-
prises; the Civil Service needs them all. More, it can provide them
all with work exactly suited to individual qualifications and talents.
The Government is today the largest employer of scientists and
engineers in the country, and has staff working in almost every
field of pure and applied science and engineering. Plant pathology
and naval architecture, thermodynamics and physiology, celestial
mechanics and highway engineering: these are just a few diverse
examples.
Prospects in the Civil Service compare favourably with those
existing in industry: every able scientist or engineer should achieve
a salary of £2,500 within a reasonable period; and an outstanding
man or woman (they receive equal pay) will do so in the earlythirties.
The top posts, which carry salaries of up to £8,000, are open to all.
At each level, there is full scope for the exercise of personal initiative
and responsibility. Laboratory equipment and engineering facilities
are of the highest order. Conditions of service are good and pensions
are non-contributory. Recruitment to the Scientific and Engineering
Civil Service is by interview—there are no written examinations.
There are openings at various levels and for almost every type of
scientific and engineering qualification. To obtain detailed informa-
tion, send a postcard mentioning age and qualifications, to:

On the afternoon of Saturday,
19th December, four I.C, VIH's
took part in the Thames Rowing
Club Plum Pudding Races, which
mark the end of the pre-Christ-
mas training.
Altogether, eleven crews were
rowing with suitably determined
handicaps so that they should all
cross the finishing line together.
The crews were started at Chis-
wick Steps to row to T.R.C. (about
2 miles): just before Hammer-
smith Bridge I.C. 1st had already
passed I.C. 3rds, and 4ths. who
had started 35 and 45 seconds
ahead respectively; in order to
do this I.C. lsts had to fight their
way through six other crews,
which were all racing side by side
at one stage. By Harrods' De-
pository, I.C. 2nds were leading
I.C. lsts by four lengths, and
Thames lsts were lying third
about one and a half lengths be-
hind I.C. lsts.
With two hundred yards to go
Thames lsts pushed their bows in
front of I.C. lsts, but could not
catch I.C. 2nds, who were first
across the line; deservedly carry-
ing off the prize pin of ale.
On the same afternoon, on the
same reach, Vesta Rowing Club
held the Sabine Tankard Regatta
at which I.C. was represented.
The crew did well, rowing above
its status, to be runner up in the
final, losing to a heavier and fitter

The First team has continued
its run of success by defeating
U.C. in the quarter-finals of the
U.L. Cup. The 2nd team will
face Battersea in this round which
should be a closely fought match.
In the League Divn. 1, the First
team is still undefeated but will
meet the strongest challengers in
the next few matches. Difficulties
in team turn-out have resulted in
only average performances from
the remaining teams.
