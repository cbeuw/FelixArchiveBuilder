LIVING WITH THE
ARCHITECTS
The major change to which we
shall have to become accustomed
is a fourth constituent college
when the School of the Archi-
tectural Association moves from
Bloomsbury to South Kensington.
We are looking forward both to
working together in fields of mu-
tual interest and to the enlivening
influence of those from another
discipline. A great deal of finan-
cial support will be required and
we expect that it will be some
years before the union is achieved,
though this is a particularly busy
time for those working out the
arrangements.
In our own undergraduate
courses there are unlikely to be
major changes-
in the pattern, type
and length. Students will be ac-
cepted to read for honours de-
grees in primary disciplines and
study in more specialised fields
will continue to be deferred to the
postgraduates age. I hope that
it will be easier for undergradu-
ates to transfer from one depart-
ment to another and that there
will be greater freedom of choice
and variety in the courses for
ancillary subjects. These might
extend to subjects outside Science
and Technology and to those
given in- other departments.
POSTGRADUATE
DEVELOPMENTS
At the postgraduate stage one
year courses of study will con-
stantly develop and change. This
is a dynamic part of our work
whitii responds very quickly to
meet the needs of industry and
government. A recent example
is the course on Transport, started
less than a year after the publi-
cation of the Buchanan Report.
Many of the most active scientific
and technological fields at the
moment border on different disci-
plines. Several of our courses are
designed for these workers and
further cooperation between de-
departments—and not limited to
such courses—may be expected.
We shall be taking a look at three
particular areas—earth sciences,
life sciences and natural resources.
It is a fairly safe prediction that
our computing facilities, soon to
be operational, will increase the
tempo in many fields. Even in
the next decade fresh growing
points, at present unforeseen, may
spring up at the College, but
some space has prudently been
reserved for them in our long-
term plan.
RESIDENTIAL AND SOCIAL
LIFE
Most of the additional residen-
tial and social provision will be
provided through the full de-
velopment of the sif
es in Prince's
Gardens. The next two projects
will, we hope, be the Sports
Centre on the north-west corner,
and New Hall in the south-east
one. The refectories and com-
mon rooms in College Block will
provide another main centre for
social life, and conveniently near
the libraries.
In writing of the future the
most important point can some-
times be overlooked; that the
College only comes to life
through its members—its staff
and students. To them much is
being given and from them much
will be expected. The years
ahead are full of promise and op-
portunity.

STC is the sort of company in
which the bright man (or
woman) can develop^—it's big,
decentralized; deals with sophis-
icated technologies; covers most
apects of telecommunications,
electrical and electronic engin-
eering; is- alive and fast moving.
The opportunities for promotion
are excellent, as 900 of our
people discovered last year. And
we pay rather well.
Come and see for yourself
during the Easter vacation: we'll
be glacf to let you see our
factories and laboratories at our
expense. You can make the
necessary arrangements with our
representatives when they visit—
