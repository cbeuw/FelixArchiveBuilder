Phoenix — Two Views
By J. M.
(Editor,
As early as last November, the
editor and sub-editor of "Phoenix"
approached your reviewer in the
Beit Quad and persuaded him to
write a few words on the latest
issue. He accepted, but not with-
out misgivings. What could one
have said about previous
" Phoenix "? One had to be an
" arty type " to appreciate most
of the content of last year's issues.
To the plain, unassuming scientist
it was so much trash. Surely
Shakespeare turned in his grave!
This issue is a considerable im-
provement. The presentation and
the format are of the same high
standard that '"Phoenix" has
has always set. The articles are
well written, both in respect of
the standard of English and in
their readability. It was pleasing
to find that in general those
stories with a veiled meaning
yielded their secrets with a little
prodding.
Whilst one cannot vouch for
the factual correctness of the
articles on the development of the
College, and on higher education
in Israel, they contain a wealth of
detail, evidence of considerable
hard work on the part of the
N O T L E Y
Scrutiny)
authors. The pretentiousness in
style and concept of the scientific
literature was shown up for what
it is worth.
One wonders to what can be
attributed this singular improve-
ment in a magazine which until
recently was rapidly approaching
its doom. Can it possibly be
connected with the appointment,
as deputy editor, of a former
editor of " Scrutiny "?

The latest issue of " Phoenix "
appears to continue its recent
chaotic course. The face may
have changed, but the spirit re-
mains the same.
The cover lacked the striking
qualities of its two predecessors
(the bird on the Union door
would have been more appro-
priate and striking). Presentation
was spoilt by the complete lack
of photographs—an opportunity
was missed to polish Paul Rogers'
informative article (many photo-
graphs are available of college
development in progress and of
models of the future look).
Poor presentation also must
have deterred non-Israelis from
reading Carol Thompson's article
on education (and her editorial
was a tedious skeleton out of the
cupboard). But Brian Bull's item
was excellent (though I know of
one English folksong collection of
1882) and should surely further
his cause.
Tony White's story too was well
conceived and executed, and his
characters were convincing (his
Welshman is my roo:n-mate!).
Chris Wright's science-fiction was
mediocre. Peter Hall must have
had a nervous breakdown, and
one hopes that this was the worst
example of his literary powers—
as also Reg. Lindsey.
The same may be said for the
poets—only three lines of Chris-
tine Youle's "Lament" made any
sense! and Bruce Gregory should
stick to his abacus.
Artwork, however, was gene-
rally good, but it was unfortunate
that Chris Wright's mythological
figures were titled only in the
Contents. But I preferred Brian
Bull's block colour to Mr.
Wright's dots, dashes and Topol-
ski impressions.
No amount of quotes filched
from Herodotus, Byron or Shaw,
items from past issues, or tongue-
in-cheek hints for thesis-writers
can compensate for poor original
works.
As in so many other Union
activities the main problem is
apathy, and a small nucleus of
diehards are left to struggle
amateurishly on. Remedies:
More contributions, please
(greater competition is bound
to improve the magazines quality
next copy date February 1); and
" Phoenix" staff, see what the
national magazines do, and try to
emulate their better points (why
not start with the Reader's Di-
Rest ?).

TO EDUCATE
IS TO LEAD
Never has there been greater need for such leadership,
or greater opportunities for teachers to take this lead.
Education today is full of new life; one of the major
growing points of our society. To people of ideas and
initiative, it offers a creative career of increasing scope,
in which they will be able to make use of their talents
and attainments to the full. Many exciting new things
are happening in the education service... things in
which you might take part.
Ask for the new booklet, C.E.G., at your University
Appointments Board, or from the Department of
Education and Science, Curzon Street, London, W1.
