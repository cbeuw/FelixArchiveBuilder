armed with pencils and a "re-
porter's note pad," our repre-
sentative turned reporter arrived
at 6 sharp, knocked back a quick
cup of lukewarm ten, and was in
position, pen poised, when Presi-

hammer sharp on 6.09. .The
With meeting of the Imperial
College Union Council had begun.
As usual, many things were
discussed and many words
cpoken. The results were new
constitutions for the Silwood
Park Union Committee and Felix
(Kearns: "I didn't hear that."
Price: " Too late, it's been
passed."); a new external affairs
committee (chairman, Saxton);
the present of a return ticket to
the nc :t Union meeting for Keith
Cavan gh and motion; a grant

enable the Debating Society to go
to Ireland (and return again?);
and a potential new look Ents.
committee.
The last-mentioned will prob-
ably affect most people. Vice-
President Mair reported that the
investigating body, after some
initial difficulty in deciding what
entertainment meant, had recom-
mended that the present Ents.
Committee should be expanded to
include the presidents of the Film,
Folksong, and Jazz clubs who
would sever their connections
with R.C.C. Effectively, this will
mean that all College entertain-
ment will be coordinated through
one committee, and the differen-
tial entrance fees to functions will
be abolished. Regular mid-week
jazz and folk sessions and Sunday
films look like being the order
of the day in the near future.
Cavanaghwas half-way through
proposing his motion about or-
ganizing a lecturing methods con-
ference, when Collins put down a
procedural motion against the
motion being put (got that?).
Several members agreed that if
motions were to be sent to Council
from inquorate Union meetings,
then there was no point in having
a quorum in the first place.
Anand (quote) " clarified the
issue and thought the motion a
good way of dispelling the clique
image which most students had
of Council, but Collins was
heavily supported when it came to
voting. Secretary Utting com-
plained that the issue had been
badly mishandled by Price, the
latter agreed and apologised, and
Cavanagh departed.
Alarmed by intelligence reports
of " armies of lab. assistants '
using Southside facilities illegally,
the Executive announced that it
had decided to hold a card check
in Union buildings this term.
Exploration Society
Sir John Hunt
The Exploration Society con-
tinues to attract well-known and
entertaining people to come and
talk. On Tuesday, 19th January,
Sir John Hunt, of Everest fame,
gave an illustrated talk on a trek
he made with 9 other moun-
taineers and 22 young people,
ages 18-20 at present working in
Industry, through the Pircdus
Mountains, Greece, in April 1963.
As far as he knew this had
never been done before and the
party travelled over 200 miles on
foot in 17 days. Some of the
colour slides he showed were of
superb quality, and gave a real
insight into the barren country of
inland Greece as well as the
hardships involved in making a
trek across the snow covered
mountains.
This year Sir John hopes to
take a similar party to Poland.
The next meeting of the Society
is on 2 February, when the sub-
ject will be Aerial Photography.
Don't say I didn't tell you! Con-
cern was also expressed at short-
comings in the duty officer system,
or rather in some duty officers.
FOR WELFARE
Cabaret time, and Tye pro-
duced a specimen heavy type col-
lege scarf for approval. After a
convincing demonstration of the
inadequacy of a " five-footer " on
Tye's ample form, it was unani-
mously decided to order the thing
in six foot lengths.
A spirited discussion on the
pros and cons of installing a fruit
machine at Harlington heralded
the jclose of the meeting, the cons
winning on a quick vote before a
mass exodus to the bar. Oh, by
the way, I forgot to say that Sid
Lipton will be playing at the 1965
Commem. Ball. If you're in-
terested, that is.

and defended their tendencies to
overcrowd their houses as a
natural reaction to their inse-
curity. Coloured immigration is
a problem we have to overcome,
and Lord Brockway felt that an
attitude, like that taken by the S.
African government was at the
best retrograde.
He ended by saying how
pleased he was to see that IC, like
other student bodies throughout
the country, had formed a society
to promote racial equality and
that such a pressing problem had
interested both staff and students
and had encouraged them to do
something about it.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
