I C. Do Well
Against Formidable Opposition
The training camp was due to
start at Miskin near Cardiff on
28th December, but had to be
delayed by twenty four hours due
to the snow which had cut off
much of South Wales. However,
the thaw was quick and training
was not badly affected.
The finals was the Nos Galan
at Mountain Ash on New Year's
Eve. I.C. had already seen the
courses for the five races, of
which club members had entered
two—the one and the four miles.
Mountain Ash is a small mining
town in a deep valley, and the
courses all include an uncom-
fortable number of very steep
hills. Still, at least the snow was
almost clear, and hills were not as
dangerous in descent as they
might have been.
4 p.m. saw the start of the mile
race, I.C. had little hope of suc-
cess as there were five inter-
nationals in the field of thirty!
H. Dickson caused quite a stir by
leading the first break after half
a mile. Inevitably he faded but
finished only twenty seconds be-
hind two four minute milers
(Simpson and Whetton) in 15th
place. A . Bishop was a tired
17th after a severe cold and P.
Blake 25th.
Olympic Send-off
During the evening other races
were held and then near midnight
the climax mounted. A torch-
bearer ran down the mountain-
side preceeded by a car with
police siren, and eventually ran
down the packed mam street with
a further escort of more torch
bearers. As he reached the start
of the four mile race, a Verey
rocket was ignited followed by
over two hundred runners to the
ecstatic cheers of spectators, who
lined every yard of the route with
flaming torches—an atmosphere
unrepeatable anywhere else.
Those who had earlier raced in
the mile soon found the bills very
hard going, but A . Cope had a
very good race, just winning a
Nos Galan vest (awarded to the
first fifty) and was backed up well
by D. May and D. Reaves. The
race was won by A. Simpson,-who
came fourth in the 1500 metres
in Tokyo and the College was
tenth out of twenty-eight teams,
much higher than expected.

Cohesion
Sadly Lacking
By R. GRUNDY
I.C. 3-4 Reading University.
Struggling near the bottom of
the Premier League, I.C. disap-
pointingly returned from Harling-
ton on Saturday, January \6th,
without the mudh needed win to
boost their dwindling confidence.
With Grundy back in the team
at centre-half, the home side had
been slightly rearranged, Morland
moving up to centre-forward to
demonstrate his much boasted
talents. This excellent move soon
paid off when Morland clinched a
half-chance with a shot from close
range. At this stage the I.C.
wing-halves easily contained a
dormant Reading attack, and kept
the home forwards well supplied.
Luxton and Crisp were both in
elusive form and the latter made
use of his exceptional control in
the muddy conditions to formu-
late the second I.C. goal. Moving
through the Reading defence on
the left he crossed the ball for
Batcup to score with one of those
"out-of-the-hat" twentv-five yard
drives. Soon afterwards, Luxton
put the ball into the net but was
adjudged to have used his hands.
Reading now came more into
the game and scored when the
centre-forward was left un-
marked, and a minute later a long
shot from the Reading inside-
right completely beat the I.C.
defence and evened the scores.
In the thirty-fifth minute, I.C.
were awarded a free kick from
which Johnson, aided by the wind,
scored with a high, dipping lob.
However, the I.C. defence, play-
ing the double centre-half system
repeatedly showea lack of cohe-
sion. This was demonstrated
when the Reading centre-forward

"God help Cardiff" was Arthur
Loveday's comment when he
heard of the proposed ffagins' trip
to the Welsh capital for the
England v. Wales Rugby Inter-
national. The party, some 20
strong, clutching sleeping bags
and cans of beer, left Paddington
at 6 p.m. on Friday, 15th Janu-
ary. Emerging from the piles of
empty cans at Cardiff station they
were met by some of the Cardiff
University Biochemists who they
were to play the next morning.
The opposition set out to drown
any potential playing ability in
the ffagins' team; little resistence
to this gesture was forthcoming
from ffagins. After stop-tap and
a curry, accommodation was
sought and eventually found. The
number of residents of University
Hall increased substantially that
night.
Saturday morning dawned wet
and windy. Late, as usual, fifteen
players turned out to play in vile
Conditions—heavy rain and high
winds. The game was very even,
but the I.C. backs could not
handle the ball cleanly. Cardiff
snatched an early lead which
they held throughout, despite
several heavy attacks by ffagins,
and won 3-0. Ffagins supporters.
Potts, Jenkins and an unidentified
young lady were soaked to the
skin, an experience shared by the
rest watching "The Match" in
the afternoon.
When the time came to get wet
inside, the Park Hotel did a roar-
ing trade. A jumbled recollection
of Saturday night remains: Top-
liss and a " lady" in a cattle
truck; Davies and Topliss going
60 miles to Llanelly to find a bed;
Potts bumming his way into a
dance with a fantastic story. Lips-
combe putting up 2 Cardiff Stu-
dents on the floor"of his(!) room
in University Hall; the unidenti-
fied lady supporter putting up 2
of the lads and giving them break-
fast in bed. (Is there anything
else you want, Sam?).
was again left un-marked and
scored after dribbling round
Wojtowizc in the I.C. goal.
The home team had to be re-
organised at half-time when
Grundy suffered a recurrence of
a knee injury and moved into the
forward line, Morland dropping
back. A Reading full-back was
then taken off with a torn liga-
ment thus reducing both sides to
virtually ten men.
Further stoppages resulted in a
deterioration of the game, but
Reading took tne lead trom a
penalty when their left-winger
was fouled in the area. The match
was then allowed to coast unin-
spiringly to an end, and the hol-
low cheer from I.C. seemed to
echo their despair.
