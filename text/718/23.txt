Firstly, thanks for all who
nave written, especially the
following;
In the poetry section,
although not strictly
rhyming, I was impressed
with David Neasham's
(LS2) Entry, and £10 is
ready to be collected from
the FELIX Office. It is
untitled, so make of it as
you will.
And it was dark.
No breath of wind,
No shiver of branch.
1
There stood silence.
There comes a cry
Soaked with fear
For the wind that carries the
way;
The arms which hold your
bones to walk.
Such pain was not seen
In the place where the
echoes last.
That agonising symphony
Ceaseless to be.
The pit of all.
For whom shall take my feet
from its mouth?
Look!
There stands the light.
David Neasham

On the song front, here is
the promised 'The
MacDonalds Massacre', by
Ker Buckley (Remember
the events of August 1984?)
13 Aug 1984 The Mac
Donald Massacre
If you go to MacDonalds
You're best off not to frown
'Cos if yo Do
Our Loony crew
Will come and mow you
down
There's flicknives for the
young ones
Theres pistols for the old
And out the back A maniac
Will fill you full of holes
It's the buckshot at
MacDonalds you'll enjoy
And once you make the
pavement
If you should get that far
You'd better run
or another one
Will hit you with a car
We're always eating fast food
We eat until we burst
There's Chinese
And Tandooris
MacDonalds's are the worst
It's the puke after Mac
Donalds you'll enjoy
'The Ballad of Big John
Parkes', alas, has to wait for
another time. Thanks also to
Martin S Taylor for his Song.
Unfortunately I can't read
music, but it was lyrically
excellent. How about 'The
Phoenix' Martin?
A m o n g a s e l e c t i o n of
limerics sent ira were these
by Alan Rose.
The Man who became IC
President,
Applied to become a hall
resident.
But he pissed on the floors.
And he smashed up the
doors.
So the warden of Linstead
was hesitant.
There is a young fellow
called Hugh,
Who produced a FELIX for
you.
But I have to confide
That there's little inside
That is relevant, useful or
true.
The Hon Sec that people call
Q,
Is much more attractive than
you,
That's why Lusty Liz,
Thought that he was the biz
Ask Kingston, he'll tell you
it's true.
Finally, some more
cockney Rhyming slang,
from a West Londoner, Roy
Adams! From a long list,
here are a few more
common ones which I
forgot and which you might
hear—
Clothes pegs—legs
Almond Rocks—socks
Peckham Rye—tie
Porky Pie—lie
Jam Jar—car
Toe Rag—fag
Also some 'College based'
ones—How a b o u t -
Governing Body—hot toddy
College Deans—ways and
means
Silwood Park—bit of a lark
Under Grad—not too bad
Post Grad—never sad
Sports Ground—lost and
found
R e f e c t o r y m e a l s — j e l l i e d
eels
Union Bar—near and far
Micro-computer—Pea Sho-
oter.
There's a few pints for
Alan, Kev and Roy waiting
in the Holland club when
they're next in. Who knows,
it may make them feel like
writing more!
