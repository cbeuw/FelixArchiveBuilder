An easy guide to find the perfect employer
'How do I choose which
employer to apply to ? They
all seem much the same. I'll
apply to the seven largest,
most famous employers with
the most vacancies and that
will probably do'.
It might work but, if you
have spent any time at all
choosing what occupation you
wish to follow, it seems a pity
to mess up you future
happiness by failing to carry
out adequate research on your
prospective employer.
There are five Directories of
employers of graduates,
'Register of Graduate
Employment and Training'
(RoGET); 'Graduate
Employment and Training'
(GET); 'Graduate
Opportunities' (GO); 'Directory
of Opportunities for
Graduates' (DOG) and,
'Directory of Opportunites in
New
Technology'(DONT)These are
a good source for your
preliminary list of possible
employers. Besides outlining
the vacancies that they may
have, they may tell you about
the Company's size, its
location, its pattern of
employment and even a little
of its pholosophy. Many
employers produce special
Graduate brochures which
provide profiles of recent
graduate entrants of the 'Day
in the Life of..' variety. There
are many videos for those who
prefer watching and listening
to reading. These can be
viewed in the Careers Video
Room, key from Sherfield
Room 309. Although all these
sources will tell you
something of the companies;
they are produced and written
by the jmployers themselves
and therefore are unlikely to
paint the companies n
anything other than glowing
terms. The same can be said
of the recent graduates
brought along to Company
presentations. A company is
unlikely to bring along people
who think it's a foul company
in which to work! So how can
you find out which company is
for you? Firstly, you must
know what you want from an
employer. What sort of
environment would you enjoy,
what promotion prospects or
training would suit you best,
do you want a very open,
friendly style of management
or would you prefer more
conservative formal firm?
What other factors are likely to
make the difference for you
between one employer and
another? Then when face to
face with employers or recent
graduates, you can quesition
them closely. The Careers Fair
is a good place to start. You
might ask them why they think
you should work for them
rather than for X and Co
although don't sound too
arrogant when doing so!
Another valuable way of
finding out about different
employers is at the old
students' Association Careers
evening.
Once you have narrowed the
field of employers, you can
save everyone an awful lot of
time by checking whether the
companies actually have
vacancies in the areas of
which you are applying. Every
year, a well known computing
Company is inundated with
applications for computer
programming jobs. They do
have between 400 and 500
vacancies but not for
computer programmers.
If the company is visiting
the campus during the
Graduate Recruitement
Porgramme then you can
obtain the application forms
for the Careers library
otherwise you will have to
apply directly to the company.
And finally, think about
'falling back positions'. Please
consider the wisdom of only
applying it to the big,
glamours, well-known
companies. Every year on the
Imperial Graduate Recruitment
Programme, perfectly
respectable companies have to
cancel their visits through lack
of applications. Just think
what it would do to your
chances of success if you
applied to such a company.
Applications

Books have been written on
this topic and so it is not
particularly easy to condense
into a couple of hundred
words or so. A good
application is absolutely
crucial in seeking any
job—without it, you have no
chance of an interview, let
alone the job! The reasons
why most applications fail are
because they are badly
presented (illegible writing,
coffee-stains etc), ill
thoughtout and poorly
expressed. One employer
reported he had rejected 90%
on those grounds. Perhaps
more typically an employer
with about 15 jobs might
receive 700 applications and
these would be reduced to
about 150 for the first
interview. Thus it really is
significant to get the interview.
What then is the 'secret'.
Actually there is no secret at
all; just plain common sense.
So here then are a few tips.
1 Think carefully about what
kind of job you want, indentify
possible employers then read
up about them and their
vacancies.
2 Follow the instructions on
the form carefully. If they say
'attach a photograph and write
in black ink' then you cannot
expect too much if you do not
send a photograph and write
in blue ink (as a depressing
number of applicants did for
one employer last year).
3 Work out in advance your
answers to the questions on
the form.
4 Draft and edit your answers
to fit the spaces provided.
5Answer all the questions. If
one is not really applicable to
you, explain why that is so
and do not leave the space
blank.
6Keep it all simple; keep a
copy.
7 Try and view your
application from the
employers point. Would you
be impressed by the answers?
It is not likely that you would
be if there were broad
unsupported generalistions eg
'I can communicate well and
get on with people'—is the
evidence elsewhere on our
form?
8If you want more help/advice
see one of the Careers
Advisers. If also after a few
applications you haven't been
invited to an interview, come

The Unspoken
Messages'—When called to
interview the unspoken
message from the employer is
that they like the look of you
on paper and so wish to meet
you to confirm that view. The
invitation to the second
interview is that having
checked you out, 'we'd now
like to give you the proper
interview from which we may
make you an offer'.
Thus the first interview, often
held in College and certainly
for those employers listed in
the G R P programme, is
relatively short. Much will
consist of points in your
application—'Tell me more
about that', 'Why did you do
that', 'describe your project'.
In some cases there may be a
little technical content, The
interivew is also a chance for
you to ask questions—so have
some prepared! In fact be
prepared all round—dress
suitably, arrive in good time,
be friendly and positive, look
at your interviewer, be
prepared to smile, be
honest—if you don't know the
answer to a question, say so
and don't waffle!
The second interview is
normally on the employers
premises. This gives a special
chance for you to evaluate the
employer (after all it is a two
way process)— does the place
seem a good one in which to
work, are the employers
friendly, how are recent
graduates getting on etc. The
employers may have a variety
of tests for you to do—some
use psychometric tests, some
use Group Discussions— here
the important thing is not so
much whether you get the
right answers to the problem
but how you deal with other
people, how do you react
under stress. Finally there will
be the interview itself, very
often before a board. Of
course you will be nervous but
the confidence that comes
from a good preparation can
help a lot.
Once again the Careers
Service can be part of that
preparation. We are easy to
find, easy to consult and we
are running a comprehensive
programme of talks and
seminars; we also have much
literature. So if you want any
help, do come and see us.

Some filings To
Rememtmr
1) General Employment
Prospects Since the low in
1981/82, employment
prospects have been rising
steadily. Although full
Unemployment Rates are one
obvious indicator of this (and
Imperial is always at or near
the bottom of that league
table), every other measure
tells the same story. Thus
there are more jobs on offer,
more employers asking to
visit, more employers having
jobs available at Summer Fairs
and many others. While all
these signs are particularly
evident here, the same
optimisitic reports are being
made all around the country.
As might be expected,
demand is strongest in such
areas as electronics and
computer science. One
employer, commenting on the
trend reckoned they would
have to run hard to stand still!
In other words they were
going to find it much harder to
recruit as many graduates in
1986 as they did in 1985.
There has also been a good
recovery in recruitment levels
in manufacturing and, to a
slightly less extent, the oil
industry. Finance (Banking,
Accountancy, Insurance,
Commodities) and Retailing
are two other areas that need
a special mention. Most of the
employers here are making
special efforts to attract
science and engineering
graduates.
All this does NOT mean that
the 1986 graduates can sit
back and wait for attractive
job offers. The market does
not operate that way! As an
example, about 300
Electronics graduates were
unemployed at the start of the
year. It is still vital to
remember you must be
realisic—if you have taken five
years for a pass Degree do not
insisit on looking for a R&D
Job as one graduate (From
elsewhere in London) did a
few years ago. Also good
applications are crucial but
they are dealt with elsewhere
in this issue.
2) Taking a Year Off —or six
months (eg some employers
recruit in March). A year off
taken before University is
welcomed almost universally.
Quite a number think seriously
instead about having some
time off after graduation and
before starting (serious!) work.
This too can be a very
rewarding and productive
experience. As usual however,
there are some qualifications
to be made, If for example,
you are aged about 21 or 22
then there is no problem, from
an age consideration,
regarding your eventual career
prospects. If, however, you are
24 or 25 it may be less
straightforward and it could be
worthwhile to seek careers
advice first. It is also good that
at any age you would have
some sort of plan for the year
and one which you can
articulate—perhaps to a future
employer. You should be able
to talk about what your aims
were, what you gained from
the experience etc. You
should also think ahead. For
example it might be fun going
jackarooing in Australia for 12
months but you will hardly be
well placed to apply for jobs
back in the UK. For just such
simple reasons as this, 12
months off have often become
15 or more. Remember the
vacancy lists in September are
probably shorter than at
another time of the year.
Nevertheless, given some
thought and planning,some
time off after graduation can
be fun, productive and for
many, a time of great personal
development.
valuable. Here in London
temporary work is not hard to
find. I can cover many
possibilities from part-time in
a bar or as evening crew in a
MacDonanlds to challening
administrative jobs. Job
Centres can be a good source
of such work and there are
specialist agencies. Catch 22
is one such firm. (It's harder to
get a job without experience
and you can't get experience
without a job). Although the
work might well be far
removed from your ultimate
ambition, it does give valuable
insights both into people and
the nature of work. It can also
be a useful way of funding
that year off.
4) Additional Skills Another
reason for some time off after
graduation and the necessity
for temporary work, could be
the raising of finance to be
used in acquiring certain
specialist skills. These could
range from passing your
driving test (it's hard to get a
job in Sales without a licence)
to secretarial, computer or
language skills. When
employment was particulary
difficult a few years ago, it
was quite common to find
graduates making such moves.
Now the market is moving
steadily in the graduates
favour, it is perhaps less
common but nevertheless it
can be as useful and in many
cases as essential way to enter
certain areas.
5) Summer Fairs It has always
been wrong to think of
recruitment as being only a
January to March
phenomenon associated with
the Graduate Recruitment
Programme, other wise known
as the Milk Round. In fact
recruitment this is increasingly
becoming an all-the-year
round event. Nevertheless
outside the G R P the next busy
peak is during the Summer
Fairs. This is the time in June
and July, starting immediately
after finals, when there are
about 10 Fairs throughout the
country. Of these, London's is
by far the biggest. This year,
almost 200 employers
attended during its 3 days,
with a wide variety of jobs on
offer. Thus these events are
particularly useful for those
who have not wanted to think
about jobs prior to graduation.

great majority of graduates
want permanent work, each
year there are a number who
for a variety of reasons, seek
temporary work. In thinking of
