Record Club) serves two
purposes:-
1 Through the club you
will have access to trade
prices on records,
cassettes, compact discs
and videos/Cheap, cheap,

Tuesdays and collect them
on Thursdays (Dead
Convenient innit?) That's
quick, quick, quick! And
there's no problem
returning that undesirable
scratched mix of Mozart, or
the record with warp factor
5!
2 On Tuesday nights we
meet to discuss and listen
to Hi Fi of all types with
appearances by well known
manufacturers
demonstrating their wares
and letting us in on some

Author: (with baited breath)
Well, what is it?

Then, on November 12
we've got hold of

Author: Yea, I've seen it.
They're both good.
Chairman: Well, apart from
our library meetings on
Thursday that's all thats
happening for now.
Author: Well it gives me
somthing to work on.
Chairman: Got any ideas
yet?
Author: Well, maybe. We
could have this discussion
between you and me over
what to write.
Chairman: Well, stupid It'll
