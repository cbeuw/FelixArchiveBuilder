The Industrial Society and the Careers Advisory Service are presenting the Careers Fair on
Wednesday 30th October. The lair will take place in the Great Hall and Junior Common
Room from 10.00am to 4.00pm continuously.
There will be approximately seventy companies, many of whom will be looking to
recruit heavily for the first time in several years. There will be a considerable range of
activities represented at the fair with large numbers of banks and accounting firms as well
as representatives from the services and manufacturing and service industries.
The fair will require a considerable amount of organisation. If you feel you would be
able to spare some time either on the evening of Tuesday 29th October or any time on
Wednesday 30th October and help to make the fair a success then please contact me via the
chemical engineering pigeon holes. p. . . . . T - . ' V - ^ . M ^ . ^ ;
