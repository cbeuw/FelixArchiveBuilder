'IC 3rds 2-flld
Creightonians 2nds 3
Richard Ellis, our new
captain, started as he
means to go on by losing
his first game even though
he blamed it on poor
umpiring.
IC got off to a typically
bad start by giving away a
penalty flick which gave the
opposition a quick lead
which they then
consolidated with another
goal just a couple of
minutes later.
However this galvanised
the team into action and w e
were rewarded with two
quick goals shortly before
halftime, one from a
penalty flick neatly slotted
away by Per and the other
scored by Chris Harrison
putting his golfing skills to
good use on a short corner.
In the second half fitness
began to tell and eventually
the OCs scored a hotly
contested goal. All in all it
was a good performance
for only our second game
and w e have some budding
superstars emerging.
Old Isleworth 0-IC 1sts 1
Our first game in this year's
Middlesex Cup started
promptly at 11am despite
the attempts of the
opposition to win through
default by giving us the
wrong directions. Although
our opposition were a
division below us it became
obvious that this game was
not going to be a walkover.
The first half saw both
sides in difficulty on what
can only be described as a
bumpy pitch. Both teams
were able to get the ball
into their opponents D but,
whereas their attacks were
coming to grief on a very
tight defence, our attacks
were proving rather more
succesful with their
goalkeeper proving to be
our main obstacle. The first
half also saw us reduced to
ten men with Brendan
forced to leave the pitch
with what proved to be a
fractured hand. However,
rapid reorganisation
allowed us to continue with
a clear advantage. The
second half was far more
one sided with very few of
their attacks entering our
25. The forward line of
Justin, Paul and Nigel were
obviously too good for their
defence and it was
therefore no surprise,
altough it was a great relief,
when Nftjel slotted a
r e v e i r e stick shot under an
advancing 'keeper to give
us a deserved lead. Overall
a good team performance
with a score-line that does
not reflect how well the
opposition keeper was
playing. (Thanks to Jim for
umpiring).

Although neither team
fielded a complete team of
6, IC had a vastly superior
team, who won every game,
with the loss of only 7
points in the entire match.
Congratulations ladies.
IC 5-St Marys 4
After a number of hard
fought games IC just
managed to win the fixture.
This means that after 2
games IC mens 3rds have a
100% record. Thanks to all
those who almost managed
to get up and get into
College for 10am on a
Saturday.

Well—this past week has
been a busy one for the
Virgins. We played one
match in Bristol against the
Clifton Suspenders on
Sunday, October 13, and
another match against the
UCL 'Tanks' (our fond
nickname for them) on
Wednesday October 16.
The Bristol match on
Sunday was somthing to be
proud of; we were down in
the first half 14-4, but came
back in the second half to
draw 14-14. Star players on
Sunday included Nathalie
(Speedy—Gonzales)
Laidler, who got the ball
within inches of a try every
time; Vickie (Cave Woman)
Williams—who intimidated
everyone on the opposition;
and our own Anne (Pisso)
Parsons, who scored Try
upon try.
The match on
Wednesday, sadly, was not
quite such a victory; we
lost to UCL 16-0, we didn't
play badly—all their tries
were scored in the first
half: By the second half we
were finished warming up
and a angry enough to give
them a real run for their
money. (The Captain of
UCL is really nice).
Anyway—remember
Virgins —practices
Tuesdays and Thursdays at
12.45pm in Beit Quad.
Watch the notice board
outside the Union for

matches.

IC 2-Middlesex/UCH 9
Continuing their successful
start to the season, the first
recorded another
memorable victory on
Saturday against a well-
drilled hospital side.
After five minutes IC had
already stamped their
authority on the game.
From a sets scrum the ball
was spun wide and Nick
scored under the posts,
with Mike adding the
conversion. UCH and the
ref dragged themselves
back into the games with 2
dubious penalties just
before half-time.
After the turn-round the
pack, aided by extra
stability from 'Cruture'
Denkins in the front row,
scored a pushover try
which was then converted.
In the dying miutes of the
gamee, UCH were given a
final consolation penalty
from their fairy godmother
the ref.
Scorers: Tries Nick, Steve.
Conversion, 2.

The day started with John
Spence introducing himself
to our new recruit from the
IF with the words 'You
must be Rebecca, I'm your
captain'. Instantly
hypnotised, Spence (not for
the first time) proceeded to
lose himself on the Circle
Line and ended up running
from Bank to London
Bridge. Having arrived on
time we decided to play an
8-a-side game, the dregs
from the first team arrived
in Jon Stonham's car fresh
from actually winning in
the morning. We set about
about the formality of
knocking the goals in-a
task performed with
consumate ease by Dave
Whitton who scored 4
times. Other goals came
from Jim Ward and Chris
Harrison. Another
noteworthy performance
came from Rolf, our
keeper, dribbling up the
wing.
