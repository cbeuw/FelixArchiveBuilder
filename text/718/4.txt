I Good Riddance
The Fremantle Hotel, which
for the last three years has
been used as Hall of
Residence, was gutted by a
fire on Wednesday evening.
Fire Brigade spokesman
told FELIX that over 50
firemen had been required
to put out the blaze. He
said that over 50% of the
building had been
destroyed. At the time of
the fire nobody was living
in the hotel.
The Fremantle Hotel was
unpopular with residents.
During the three years that
the Hotel was a residence
FELIX regularly ran stories
about the poor condition
that residences were forced
to endure. Michael Arthur,
the Student Services
Officer of the time, did not
deny that College were
hoping to take on the
residence for another three
years. The Fremantle Hotel on Thursday morning
Rain Stopped

The Phantom Soaker
refered to in last week's
FELIX letters page has
struck once more. Three
plastic bags containing
water were tipped over
victims as they were seated
in the gents toilets in the
Physics department on
Tuesday.
Similar attacks have been
occuring since mid-
September. Thirty incidents
have been reported to date.
The 'Phantom' has
concentrated his efforts in
the Sherfield building, but
has also visited the Physics
and Mechanical
Engineering departments.
A letter, signed by The
Phantom Soaker' has been
mysteriously delivered to
the FELIX office:
Dear Editor,
In reply to Dr R
Benodekars letter
published in the 18th
October issue the carrier-
bag in quesition was not
full of water as described
but about half-full of water.
This kind of misleading
information from so called
academics' should justly
be rewarded with a soaking
and any other Imperial
persons who are regarded
by myself as 'snobby nosed
swots' will be duly
showered.
Yours sincerely,
The Phantom Soaker
'The Phantom has got to
be some kind of nut' said
John Boroughs of Security.
Geoff Reeves, Chief
Security Officer, has
expressed concern for the
Phantom's health and is
appealing for any relevant
information.

Kawasaki
Slams
Porsche
A motor bike was pursued
through the College
grounds in a James Bond
style chase last Friday. The
bike, closely followed by a
police van, hit a speed
ramp and jumped twenty
five feet before hitting a
parked Porsche. The rider
then climbed off his
crumpled Kawasaki and
made his escape. He was
later apprehended behind
the chemistry department.
A small amount of
damage was done to the
underside of the Porsche,
owned by Dr Wakeman of
Chemistry, but the
motorbike was written off.
Police have declined to
comment on the incident.
The chase occured whilst
a student was being carried
away from the Life
Sciences dinner by
ambulance men. Mr
Haldane Broby, who had
been drinking whilst on a
course of antibiotics,
collapsed at the dinner and
was taken to St Stephens
hospital. He later regained
consciousness and
discharged himself. He has
now recovered.
Bars
Takeover
IC Union will begin a
phased takeover of the
Union bar on 1st January
1986, if proposals put
forward by College
Secretary John Smith are
approved. Mr Smith has
prepared a first draft of a
paper to be submitted
jointly with Union President
Carl Burgess at the next
meeting of House
Committee on November 6.
If the plans go ahead, the
Union will assume full
control of the bar on 1st
August 1986. The draft
makes no mention of
whether control of other
Union rooms will be
included in negotiations for
a takeover.
To gain control of the
bars the Union must first
obtain a corporate legal
identity in order to apply
for a liquor licence. There
will be an inaugural
meeting of the Union
Planning Group next
Thursday at 6.15pm in the
SCR to discuss the bar
takeover and the future of
the Union Building as a
whole. Anyone interested is
welcome to attend. The
Union's response to Mr
Smith's initial proposals,
and the control of Union
rooms not within the
building will also be
discussed.
ASTMS
Protest
Mr John Fecamp, branch
secretary of ASTMS, is
writing to College
Secretary John Smith to
ask if College facilities will
be used by staff or students
working on the Star Wars
project. His concern
follows the disclosure that
Professor Manny Lehman
has signed a contract to
work on the project as
reported in FELIX last
week.
Mr Fecamp feels that
many members of IC may
object to any such use of
College facilities. The Star
Wars project, he believes, is
morally wrong and
involvement in it would be
damaging to the college's
image. Mr Fecamp is
prepared to take the matter
to the board of governers
or the College ethics
Committee.
