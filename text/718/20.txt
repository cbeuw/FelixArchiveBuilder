The Rising
Keane.
The Rising Tide and Good
Behaviour
M J Farrell (a.k.a. Molly
Keane)
Both these books concern
the priveliged Anglo-Irish
landowning class-
particularly the women
therein. A dazzling life of
balls, coming-out parties,
hunting and dress
allowances is contrasted
with the miserable lives the
Bright Young Things
usually led as children.
Hence these satires are
pretty bleak; Molly was
wreaking vengance for all
the indignities she and her
friends must have suffered
as adolescents.
The opening to 'Good
Behavior' is bizarre: the
central character, Aroon St
Charles, kills her invalid
mother who has a phobia
about eating rabbit by force
feeding her with a mousse
of baby coney. The book
then traces Aroon's
childhood; starting at the
tender years, when her mad
governess who had a crush
on Mr St Charles,
commited suicide - first
telling Aroon how terrible
sex was. Next came the
First World War that robbed
Ireland of its remaining
young men and left Aroon's
father with only one leg,
then Aroon's affair with
Richard, her homosexual
brother's best 'friend,'—who
spent half an hour in bed
with her and even kissed
her!
Eventually death duties,
taxes, and falling revenues
drove the St Charles Family
into petty cutbacks and
On the doorstep of Imperial College itself is one of the
finest landscape photography exhibitions of the year,
taking place at the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington
Gardens. The exhibition is a retrospective of the last ten
years of Fay Godwin's work, entitled simply, Land: stark,
desolate landscapes, always on the edge of habitation.
There is always evidence of humans having lived in her
scenes of Scotland and Wales—the megaliths arrayed atop
moors and the deserted cottages tucked into the crooks of
valleys. Should an animal even wander into her pinsharp
focus, they are frozen as if they are statues, forever a part
of the scenery. Clouds form an integral part of the
composition singled out with polarising filters and fixed in
time. All these components might have made her
photographs lifeless and shallow; but an innate knowledge
of both subject and techniques avoids this problems. The
pictures evoke the atmosphere and form a true portrait of
each scene.
economies, all the while
refusing to consciously
acknowledge they are
getting any poorer. The
whole book brilliantly
displays Aroon's self
delusions, until you can
wonder how anyone is that
foolish—but perhaps the
answer lies in the title of
the book. Good Behavour
is publihsd by Abacus and
costs £2.95.
The Rising Tide contains
far less humour and
without that light touch the
main characters seem even
more dismal and
depressed. Two Queen
Bitches, the dowager lady
and her daughter-in-law,
fight it out for the control
of the hearts and minds of
those around them. One is
left wondering if all the
Irish aristocracy are mad,
bad or emotionally
downtrodden. There is no
happy ending: youth makes
the same mistakes that its
grandparents did, and the
ghosts of sad childhoods
blight the lives of middle
aged couples. A good book
in it own way, which subtly
informs its reader that
middle-aged women have
libidos too. Published by
Virago, costing £3.95, both
these books are stocked by
