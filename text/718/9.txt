The National Centre for
Alternative Technology
(NCAT) is situated in the
midst of wooded hills near
Machynlleth, mid-Wales.
Arriving there, as our party
did late at night, we were
struck first by the cold
cleanliness of the air, the
silence and the millions of
visible stars—quite a shock
after London—but it wasn't
till the following morning,
when we awoke to an
exceptionally lovely
weather, that we realised
quite how beautiful a place
we had come to.
The Centre itself is built
in a disused slate quarry,
since its foundation ten
years ago many of the
barren slate heaps have
been lovingly reclaimed by
the planting of trees,
shrubs and grasses; and
the ruined buildings have
been totally restored. The
overall impression is one of
fertility and harmony.
However the legacy of the
old quarry is apparent
everywhere; the ubiquitous
slate has been used for
construction wherever
possible; trolley tracks run
around the site and old
tunnels lead through the
hills to stunning viewpoints
where you can gaze at the
vast sheer rock faces.
The purpose of NCAT is
to demonstrate and develop
a way of life which depends
on working with nature
rather m a n against it,
caring tor the environment
rather than thoughtlessly
harming it by needless
pollution, squandering of
previous resources like
fossil fuels, mass
distruction of the world's
wildlife and so on.
Alternative technology is
not just about windmills
and waterpumps, but about
people; it is about
achieving a healthy,
comfortable, satisfying
existence which is
sustainable indefinitely and
allows everyone a fair
share. It recognises that
people's needs can be met
with out harm to others of
the environment and that
by encouraging d.i.y.,
community schemes and
local self-reliance life could
be made a lot more
enjoyable for those
involved. Alternative
technology is based on the
belief that social progress
can not be measured by
the quantity of goods
produced and consumed
but rather by the quality of
life, which in our society
frequently means
unhealthiness, alienation,
loneliness, bewilderment
and in the long term,
ecological suicide.

Jose Michaelis recently visited the National Centre for
Alternative Technology. In this article he talks about his
experiences.
The NCAT is not just an
exhibition space; it is a
working example of the
alternative lifestyle it
advocates. It is self
sufficient in many
respects—all electricity is
generated on site by wind
and water power; heating is
provided by solar power,
heat pumps and renewable
fuels (largely wood). The
emphasis however on
conservation rather than
overproduction, so all the
buildings are well insulated
and waste heat is recovered
by heat exchangers. The
centre also filters water for
its own needs from a
nearby resevoir; and
produces its own vegetable
and dairy produce
organically (ie without
artificial chemical means).
All organic waste (human,
garden and domestic) is
recycled into compost and
as far as possible things
that won't rot are reused!
Most of the NCAT staff live
on site with their families
and thus it is a true
working community.
Decisions and tasks are
shared democratically and
staff wages reflect the
philosophy that
everybody's contribution is
valuable—salaries are
needs rather than 'merit'
based.
In order to demonstrate
that the 'alternative' lifestyle
is both possible and
desirable, the centre
welcomes visitors on a day
or residential basis. The
'visitor circuit' takes you
around a working display
of wind, water and solar
power, biofuels, energy
saving and organic farming
as well as exhibitions
explaining what alternative
technology is and why it is
necessary. The
presentation is such that
the displays are of interest
to everyone regardless of
age or depth of technical
knowledge.
As well as the
display/exhibition, the
centre runs resdiential
courses on subjects as
various as d.i.y. solar
power, wholefood cookery
and practical skills
appropriate for third world
work—the latter course
being supported by VSO
and similar voluntary
organisations. Although a
registered charity the
NCAT derives much of its
income from admission and
course fees, as well as the
do-it-yourself
windmill.
profits from the excellent
restaurant and bookshop
(where you can buy plans
for the d.i.y. windmills,
solar panels etc for a
nominal price!).
The Centre also
welcomes volunteers,
which is how we come to
be there. We spent the first
day being shown around
the site and second
engaged in a variety of
tasks from digging
drainage ditches, to
repairing windmills and
waterpumps. The
accommodation was
comfortable and cheap and
food was provided though
we organised its
preparation ourselves.
Everyone worked as hard
as they wanted to—being a
weekend, the pace was
very relaxed; during the
week volunteers are
expected to work
reasonably hard. The
atmosphere is friendly and
helpful, though, any
contribution is appreciated.
The striking thing about
the centre is how relevant
its work is to all of us; not
just to those fortunate
enough to live in the Welsh
hills! The emphasise on
individual and local self-
reliance make the
technology accessible to
everyone—and highly
desirable too; for instance
did you know that domestic
fuel consumption can be
reduced by up to 80% by
good insulation and waste
heat recovery? Although
simply materials and
constructions are used
where possible, 'hi-tech' is
not avoided but utilised
where appropriate—for
example a sophisticated
electronic device may be
used to control the flow
over a solar panel made
from an old radioator. the
technologies on display
and in use at the Centre
are eminently practical and
visable, from the largest
windmill (sophisticated
Dutch machine rated at
15Kw) to the smallest
compost bin. No one at the
NCAT appears to have
many illusions about their
work. The change towards
alternative technology and
way of life available to you,
the visitor or volunteer. A
visit may inspire you to
rethink your own career or
just give you a few ideas
about running your
household but it will be
enjoyable. The problem is,
you may be tempted not to
come back.
