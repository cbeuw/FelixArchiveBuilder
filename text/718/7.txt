This week your very own
vicious rumours column
turns its attention toward
Union personalities. Vice
Presidents are always good
for a few vices and Mines
VP Chris Griffin is no
exception. It is a Union rule
that Union premises are
only to be used for intimate
activities if they are
'discreet and unavoidable'.
Mr Griffin evidently felt no
discretion was possible
when seen in Kensington
Gardens one evening
recently. Unless the usual
bribes are forthcoming, it
may be revealed exactly
what injury he sustained
from the tarmac. Guilds VP
Symon Corns has been
making it very very publicly
known that he doesn't have
Mr Griffin's problems. After
several of the recent
Guilds' buffets he and Hon
Sec Dave Page were seen
engaging in loud and
drunken acts of public
lechery. Meanwhile, Guilds'
President Roger Preece is
rumoured to have been far
more successful with the
dashing officer approach,
and has been seen 'putting
a resident of Selkirk to
bed'.
Meanwhile, hapless IC
DP Dave Kingston was
seen using a Union minibus
to drive a young lady down
to Eastbourne in order to
get a dress in which to
accompany him to the
Commemoration Day Ball.
Unfortunately this has also
jilted a large number of
RCS officers who believed
they had enraptured the
very same fresher.
Finally, more 'Northey
Balls', it is rumoured that
due to problems with
metric and Imperial
measurements the entrance
to Mr Northey's new SCR
bar has been made too
narrow for bar manager
Alan Larson to get through.
We are now waiting for Mr
Northey's overdue run of
good luck.
And for a dig at the
competition, the C C U
papers seem to be having
their problems. Broadsheet
is currently late due to the
abscence of editor Tony
Spencer. Following a
young lady home to Evelyn
Gardens and them having
to walk back un-rewarded
to Shepherds Bush has
apparently left him
temporarily unable to walk.

FELIX Science Editor, Debbie Wilkes,
looks at new methods of insect control
and examines research being done at IC.
The damage that insect
pests cause to crops is a
major problem in many
areas of the world,
particularly tropical and
subtropical regions. As
these pests become
increasingly resistant to
conventional insecticides,
and the pressure to protect
the environment in more
acceptable ways grows, it
is clear that there is a need
to develop new methods of
insect control.
Some plants have
evolved elaborate chemical
defence mechanisms to
combat insect attack. In
many cases these natural
defences are far superior to
the man-made insecticides
that have been used over
the last few decades.
Professor Steve Ley, of the
Chemistry Department, is
naturally studying a
number of these occuring
substances, derived from
various plant sources,
which actually inhibit
insects' feeding processes.
These compounds, known
as antifeedants, have
enormous potential since
they have very low
mammalian toxicities and
can be selective for
particular insect pest
species. This selectivity is
of great value as it will
aiiow them to be used in an
area without unduly
disrupting the local
ecology. It is hoped that
the study of these
chemicals may provide
valuable information
concerning oiological
mechanisms involved, and
could ultimately lead to the
development of
commercially useful insect
antifeedants.
Many of the structures of
these complex natural
compounds are already
known but it is only
recently that people have
begun studying their total
syntheses. Professor Ley's
group have had great
success in developing
general synthetic routes to
a number of antifeedants.
These rc:;tes have been
used to produce simpler
structural analogues, which
enable the relationship
between biological activity
and molecu sti jcture to
be investigateo.
Recently, the group have
had a major breakthrough
in their work with a
particularly potent
compound called
azadirachtin.
The Neem tree
(Azadirachta Indica), which
is native to Africa and
India, has long been known

AZADIRACHTIN
for being virtually free of
insects, nematodes and
other diseases. Although all
parts of the tree seem to be
resistant, extracts from the
seed are particularly
powerful, and are highly
effective against a wide
range of crop pests. The
most important active
constituent, known as
azadirachtin, affects at least
forty species, many of
which are difficult to
control by conventional
methods.
In most cases insects
develop through ecaysis,
which consists of a series
of moults. It is believed that
azadirachtin works by
interfering with two
hormones involved in this
process; the ecdysone
(moulting) hormone and
the juvenile hormone.
Azadirachtin convinces the
insect it is approaching its
moulting phase, a time
during which it loses its
appetite for food. However,
it never goes into the full
moulting phase and
consequently dies of
starvation, or is eaten by
another predatory species,
such as birds. Another
possible commercial outlet
for azadirachtin is in the
Australian sheep industry,
where blowflies cause
damage estimated to be
over 120 million dollars a
year. Recent tests have
shown that the blowflies
will not lay their eggs in
azadirachtin impreganatec
wool. With the American
government having recently
approved the use of Neem
tree extracts for pest
control, the future looks
very promising.
Professor Ley is working
in conjunction with Rohm
and Haas, from the USA
and has been looking at
possible synthetic routes to
azadirachtin and structural
fragments. Their work has
also led them to re-examine
the accepted structure,
which was proposed some
ten years ago. The groups
work, which has involved
mainly X-Ray
crystallographic and
spectroscopic studies, has
led to an unambiguous new
structural assignment for
azadirachtin. This discovery
at Imperial College has
enormous repercussions
for those companies
designing novel structural
analogues of azadirachtin.
Increasing our
understanding of how these
natural defences work
forms an essential part of
the search for more
effective and ecologically
acceptable methods of pest
control.
