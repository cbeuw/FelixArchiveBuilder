Mari Wilson's second
appearance at the Bass
Clef this Tuesday,
continues her fortnightly
residency at Peter Ind's
successful international
jazz-venue, now in its
second year, with an
encapsulating collection o
love-songs arranged and
performed by the D.K.B.
quartet.
They gave a superb
performance. The quartet
were a superbly talented
and unobtrusive
counterpart to Miss
Wilson's singing,
performing a wide range of
40's and 50's dance tunes
and uptempo minor
ballads. At times Miss
Wilson appeared a little
uneasy, as if looking for a
stool, but, borne up by
Stuart Curtis' liberated sax,
the set never once lost its
concentration or its vitality
This is no comeback for
Miss Wilson however.

The Caucasian Chalk
Circle is subtitled 'a fable in
which everyone gets what
they deserve', which is true
enough. This amiable tale
tells of what happens to
rich and poor in a time of
political and military
upheaval in a fictitious but
vaguely biblical time and
place. As one expects in a
self respecting modern play
the rich are portrayed as
unpleasant people who
spend their time doing
unpleasant things. Sure
enough the particularly
obnoxious wife of the chief
governer leaves her baby
behind when the royal
palace is attacked in her
hurry to save her favourite
dresses. The poor child,
who we are pleased to
learn has not the time to be
tainted by wealth, is
discovered by a kitchen
maid, and she brings it up
and cares for it in the best
way her meagre resources
will allow. This causes
problems when the war
M a r i m e .
John Burgess talks to Mari Wilson
Indeed, as she was quick to
point out, Mari Wilson has
never been away. Those
heady days with The
Wilsations, (formerly The
Imaginations until a certain
funk band told them
otherwise) earned her a
recording contract with the
Compact Organisation, two
well placed chart successes
and the dismal legend of
'Miss Beehive; Queen Of
Neasden.'
Thankfully, however,
much of this is now history.
The beehive has gone. Her
amicable split with
Compact Records, with
whom she went hand-in-
hand during their early
years, was brought about in
order to escape the stylish,
though hardly substantial
stance that they have
adopted. There is a
possibility of a move to
London records, but this
hasn't been confirmed at
all. Neither does there
appear to be any hurry.
Perhaps Mari Wilson
hopes to find fame and
fortune without the
compromise and pressure
of success that recording
compaines demand. There
is no doubt that her
smooth, controllea but
wonderfully flexible voice
outstrips the efforts of
today's chart-based pri-
madonnas. She is in no
great hurry for a hit, unless
it happens by accident of
course. Indeed the relaxed
atmosphere of the London
clubs has allowed her to
strengthen her style and
technique to a far greater
degree than, say, Sade and
her previous
contemporaries.
Of becoming a new blues
legend? Certainly there
aren't enough. The jazz
scene is besotted at
present with be-bop's old
lags and sidekicks, now
pushed into the limelight
for want of anyone better.
There's no money in talent,
it appears; the real action
happens in the sidelines.
And, if necessary, that's
just where Miss Wilson is
happy to stay.
ends. However, as befits a
fable in which everyone
gets what they deserve, the
play ends with the poor
people happy and the rich
less so.
In this production the
Oxford Playhouse company
excell. All the action is
polished yet fresh,
especially that of Sylvester
McCly, who plays the part
of Azdak, a beggar-come
may take to be deliberate.
There's lots of music too.
The program says there are
47 original songs, though I
counted them not. It is
played on ethnic
instruments, and adds a
nice feel to the evening.
The murder of Father Jerzy
Popieluszko and later arrest
and trial ot four secret
crosses himself and leaves
the stage. What follows are
what I took to be fairly
accurate court proceedings
with an explanatory
narrative from the priest's
driver.
The play cannot really be
described as entertaining,
the style is much more that
of a documentary. It was
obviously of great
significance to the large
Polish contingent in the
audience especially as it's
being performed on the
anniversary of the events it
describes, but to me it
seemed flat and lifeless.
There are good
performances, Stuarat
Wilson deserves a special
mention, but a good cast
was given little to exercise
their skills. Go along if
you're very interested in
Poland, otherwise wait till it
reaches Channel 4.

ideally suited for the play's

bench sets the audience sit
on are 'in the flat', and
could not be described as

In order to mark out the

very well. The actors sail
