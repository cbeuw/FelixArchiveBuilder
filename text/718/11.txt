Is
Your last year and you
haven't a clue what to do
next? Awful, isn't it?
Perhaps if you forget about
it, it won't happen? Perhaps
if you just send off
thousands of application
forms, someone will give
you some sort of a job
which you might enjoy.?
No, better just ignore the
problem.'. No, I know, go
and see the Careers
Advisers, they'll tell you
what to do.
Unfortunately, we can't
tell you what to do, we can
help you towards the
decision, point you in the
right direction to get you
started, test out whether
you're being realistic but,
ultimately the decision is
yours. You're on your own
on this one! So where do
you start? Well you could
stick a pin into every third
page of the Graduate
Recruitement programme
Booklet or you oculd try to
be a bit more systematic
about it. First of all, you
could think about it
yourself, try to compile a
list of your characteristics
traits, your values, what
you want out of life and
your skills, what you're
good at, not forgetting of
course those things that
interest you and that you
enjoy. Then, when you look
at job descriptions, you can
compare them with your
personal profile and see
which ones match and hey
presto, you know what you
want to do next.
The trouble is, it's not so
easy to identify all these
things about yourself and
so here's some tips as to
how you might go about it.
Look at your life so far.
Why did you come to
Imperial, why are you
reading Mathematics or
Biology or whatever? What
have you enjoyed of the
experience why, what have
you hated? Was there
anything in your holiday
jobs that you found fun or
that you discovered you
were particularly good at?
How about leisure interests,
any clues there? If you
can't do it this way round,
try looking at the jobs first.
Read as many job
descriptions and adverts as
you can and when you spot
one that takes your fancy,
try and analyse why it is
that attracts you and then
you can look for other
occupations containing
these factors.Perhaps
you've seen or talked to
people whose jobs seem
interesting. Why, what was
it about that job? Your
Careers Advisor can help
you with this task or
analysing your skills and
needs by asking questions
and checking out whether
you really mean it when
you say, for example, that
all you care about is
becoming a millionaire by
time yor're 30!
There are brief
descriptions in the back of
the Directory, 'ROGET', but
for more detailed
descriptions, consult the
series of booklets
published by the
Association of Graduate
Careers Advisory Services,
all available free of charge
from the Careers Libary.
If you find all this totally
impossible and your
Careers Adviser can't help
you get started on the trail,
then they may recomend
that you complete
Gradscope Questionaire
which is a fiendishly
ingenious little toy. You
answer 50 questions and
the computer programme
comes up with your top ten
jobs..but alas you've still
got to answer the questions
,what are you good at, what
do you enjoy, what do you
want to do next.
Have you enjoyed yourself
so much as a student that
you're thinking of going
onto take a futher
qualification? There are
many reasons for
continuing your studies but
merely having enjoyed your
undergraduate years may
not be an adequate motive.
Being a postgraduate may
turn out to be very different
from being an
undergraduate. Are the
elements of your
undergraduate life that you
have enjoyed still present
at postgraduate level?
Another pretty pathetic
reason for taking a further
course is because you can't
think of anything else to do
or because this career
choice business is just too
difficult. What's going to
make it easier to think of
something else, or to
decide after another year or
three at College? If you just
continue to study and take
no active steps toward the
dreaded future, you'll find
yourself in exactly the
same dithering situation,
only slightly older!
But mind, the worst
reason of all is falling prey
to flattery. You may feel
that you're not susceptible
but come June, when you
degree results are out and
notable professors ask if
you'like to do a PhD with
them, it's so easy to be
overwhelmed by the ideas,
without thinking out the
reality. Should this happen
to you, beware false pride.
Beware the professors have
reasons of their own for
wanting PhD student and
before jumping on to three
year project, weigh up the
pros and cons and anaylse
whether it's really the right
move for you.
Before you get the
impression that I am totally
against postgraduate
studies, here are some
more positive reasons for
this course of action, you
may simply not feel
finished with studying, the
more you want to learn.
Perhaps there's a part of
your undergraduate course
that you have found
particularly infesting and
would ike to study in depth.
Many a masters course
cater for this need, eg
Astrophysics.
The most obvious reason
is vocational. Your chosen
career may require a PhD
or a further qualification eg
research in the
Pharmaceutical industry or
teaching. You may feel that
it will be easier to get a job
in your chosen field if you
possess a further
qualification, eg
Geophysics or Petroleum
Engineering. You may wish
to change direction and
another course can often
help, eg Information
Technology. Another word
of caution is required here.
It's easy to be mislead into
believing a course is more
vocational than it really is.
Admissions tutors are sure
to tell you how useful their
courses are and so make
sure you ask what
percentage of their
previous scholars are in
employment and what they
are doing. You might also
cheo. nut the value of your
chosen course with some
of the employers at the
Careers Fair or discuss it
with a disinterested person
like a Careers Adviser.
Having made the decison
to prolong your student
days, the obvious next step
is to decide where you
want to study. The Careers
office, Sherfield 309 keeps
a reference copy of,
'Graduate Studies' which
lists all the PhD and
Masters and many of the
Diploma courses available
in the UK. We can also
point you in the right
direction for information on
studying aboard. The Lyon
Playfair library has many
prospectuses and also
keeps a copy of the
'Directory Of Reserach in
British Universities and
Polytechnics' which
contains detailed titles of
PhD projects which have
been carried out recently.
Of course,you'll need to
check whether you can get
the money for your studies
and whether you need any
pre-course experience. To
be safe, you should think
about applying for PhDs
and Master around
Christmas but for many
vocational courses like
teaching, you should be
applying now. If you thinkt
that there's the slightest
chance of wanting to
continue your studies, then
apply. If you get an offer of
a place, you can alway turn
it down, otherwise you may
find yourself having to wait
a year because you
decided too late.
