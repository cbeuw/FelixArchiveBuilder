the tunnel however, in tne
enlightened article you
printed by Mr Steve
Marshall. He encourages us
to throw Ind Soc out of
College with a kick up the
backside. His illuminating
argument show how this
organisation is effectively
using IC Union to
brainwash students into a
fixed and mindless way of
thinking. But what of the
political societies? ICU
stands strong in being a
non-political union working
for students and not getting
tangled up in the usual
pointless irrelevant student
union issues. These people
are not working in our
interests at all, they are
seeking to utilise the
student population to their
advantage. I appeal to the
Union KICK THEM OUT!
SAVE THE MONEY WE
GIVE THEM.
Don't get me wrong I
believe the Union needs
healthy and active
discussion forums and
campaign groups. But I
suggest your readers'
energies are better
ploughed into apolitical
things like Debating Soc,
IC Amnesty International
and Wellsoc. Out should go
the likes of Soc Soc, Con
Soc, Ind Soc, SDP Soc,
Raving Vegans for a
Monetarist invasion of
Nicaragua Soc etc. We do
not need such grasping
social leeches trying to
lead us into ideological
blind alleys and outdated
dogmatism. If the Union
needs to become involved
in external politics it can do
so through the U G M . If it
wants to hear outside
speakers there are all sorts
of societies who will still
invite them. And if the
worst comes to the worst
and students want to join
political parties then they
are better off doing so
outside college where they
will meet a broader
selection of people with the
same narrow minded views.
Perhaps this way we will
cut down on silly notions
about banana republics and
free market student unions
which are about as relevant
to Union meeting business
as a terminal overdose of
sleeping pills. I therefore
urge you to support a
motion at an IC UGM
instructing the Union to
purge itself of all
organsations which
suppress or restrict free
thought, to cut off their
fundings (and anything else
appropriate) and to prevent
their nauseating posters
littering our walls.
Yours sincerely

Browned Off
Sir,
Having been present at the
Debating Society's
'Question Time' debate on
Tuesday lunchtime, I was
rather interested in some of
ex-Consoc chairman
Graham Brown's comments
as the debate founded on
the subject of sanctions
against South Africa
One of his most
interesting remarks was
that the aim of the African
National Congress 'is to sii;
the throat of every white
South African'. However,
the Freedom Charter of
South Africa, a document
upon which the
constitution of the A N C is
based, states that South
Africa belongs to the will o:
the people, and that we the
people of South Africa,
black and white
together—equals,
countrymen and
brothers—adopt this
Charter.'
Since the A N C is a
multiracial organisation,
would Graham Brown have
us believe that it proposes
a policy of ritual mass
suicide of its members as a
concept fundamental to the
overthrow of apartheid?

Sir,
Thanks are due to John
Martin for his letter (FELIX
717), which allows the
debate on Nicaragua to be
prolonged.
In my letter of a fortnight
ago I referred to the
Nicaraguan government as
'popular', a claim I thought
uncontentious, since
Sandinista candidates won
67% of the vote in a 75%
turnout in last November's
elections. This was,
incidentally, a record
turnout for Latin America:
even the US-approved
Salvadorean election,
where voting was
compulsory (and they're
very, er, firm with law-
breakers) couldn't match it.
That may have something
to do with the lack of
social-democratic or left-
wing candiates due to the
threats of far-right death
squads
The Sandinistas, on the
other hand, have
committed Nicaragua to
pluralism: opposition
parties hold 35 of the 96
seats in the National
Assembly as a result of the
1984 elections. These
include Liberals and
Conservatives to the right,
and Socialists, Communists
and the Popular Action
Movement to the left of the
Sandinistas. Somebody or
other will probably point to
the case of the 'Democratic
Coordinator', which refused
to take part in the
elections. To this I can only
counter firstly that the
choice was theirs and they
were under no threats from
within Nicaragua, and
secondly that the CIA are
known to have approached
them to persuade them to
this decision. The
Conservative Party (that's
the Nicaraguan
Conservatives) have
revealed that they were
infinitum. Hence Mr
Newman has jumped the
gun by producing his own
piece of clumsy character
assasination of me and
'those who support (my)
cause'. I think you will find
that despite the inferences
made in Mr Newman's
article that I hold very
similar ideals to him on
many of the issues he
raises. I would like to go on
record now that I do not
agree with hard-core
pornograpy, apartheid and
the nuclear arms race.
However I consider myself
to be a bit more of a realist
in terms of how we can
arrive at these ideals. In my
own lengthy experience at
IC I have meet a great
number of similarly minded
people. Certainly, time and
time again, motions at
also offered money to
withdraw.
Finally, let me return to
David Ashby MP
(Conservative) to whom I
referred to in my last rant.
His conclusion ran thus;
'...the electoral law was
adequate to cover secret
elections. I was able to
observe unhindered the
electoral process, and
could detect no suspicion
of malpractice. The
elections were properly
carried out'.
Yours
Peter Hobbis
UGMs concerning these
issues especially banning
Hon Porn's Night and links
with South Africa have
been consistantly defeated.
I would put this move down
to actual methods of
arriving at the ideals
involved rather than the
ideals themselves. It is
these methods which have
resulted in the character
assassination of Michael
Newman and the marty-
dom he obviously revels in.
As a result I have no
intention of apologizing to
Mr Newman as I have
nothng to aplogise for.
Yours sincerely
Mike Jones

Hypocrisy
Rant
Dear Hugh,
Whilst leafing through the
New Collins Concise
English Dictionary I came
across the word 'hypocrisy'.
'The practice of professing
standards, beliefs etc
contrary to ones real
character or actual
behaviour'. 'Hmmm-
interesting' I thought.
Certainly not a word one
could get mixed up with
honesty and self criticism
as Michael P Newman
seems to think is possible.
Having re-read my letter,
just to check, I can
distinctly find no mention
whatsoever about what my
views are concerning the
issues that Mr Newman
raises; nuclear warfare,
human rights, sexism,
pornography,
vivisectionism etc. ad
Dear Hugh,
Impressed as I am with the
new look FELIX and in
particular the consistently
high standard of features I
am appalled that you
should allow such petty
crassness to creep into the
letters page. I speak of the
political rantings of the
likes of the infamous self-
publicist Michael Newman,
the whinging pinko
socialist Pete Hobbis and
the offensively rabid right
winger John Martin. These
people are using FELIX to
spout the unimaginative
dogma of national political
organisations. Worse still
they seem to spend most of
their time and a lot ot their
money just offending each
other.
I see a light at the end of
2 Friday 25 October FELIX
