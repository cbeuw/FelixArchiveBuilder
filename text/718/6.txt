Trouble At
NUS Demo
m m
A demonstrator being removed from Trafalgar Square
Police made 280 arrests in
Trafalgar Square last
Saturday when a
demonstration spilled on to
the road in front of the
South African Embassy.
Most of the arrest were
peaceful, but protesers who
were unwilling to move
along were dealt with
forcefully. The
photographs, taken by IC
student Mark Harman show
a police officer removing a
man from the ground by
putting his fingers up the
man's nose and lifting.
The trouble occured
when students from an
NUS rally joined a group of
demonstrators from the
City anti-apartheid society.
Mr Harman, a second year
Computing student and
Chairman of the College
CND society, was taking
part in the anti-apartheid
demonstration. He told
FELIX that the early stages
of the NUS rally had
passed off without any sign
of trouble. He estimated
that about 800 students had
gathered for the protest in
Trafalgar Square. At
around 3.00pm they moved
off to deliver letters to Sir
Geoffry Howe asking for
sanctions against South
Africa. A smaller number of
students returned to
Trafalgar Square and
joined the group of anti-
apatheid demonstrators in
front of the Embassy. Mr
Harman said that the police
were probably correct to
begin arresting protestors
who were causing an
obstruction and refused to
move, but was concerned
that their methods were
unecessarily rough. He
added the the police
seemed too well prepared
for the possibility of arrests
and not sufficently
organised to make sure
that the demonstration
passed off peacefully.
In a statement to FELIX,
New Scotland Yard press
officer Martin Hobgood
described Saturdays police
operation as 'very tolerant,
restrained and well-
supervised'. When asked
about the 'fingers in the
nose' method of removing
demonstrators he said that
since July 1982 police-
officers had been taught a
'new system of arrest
techniques'. These are
based on the Japanese
aikido technique and are
intended to make the level
of force used controllable.
He added that of the 280
people arrested only 18
were being charged, and
no injuries had been
reported.
Ash Wants
More Women
The number of women
students at IC will double
to one third of all students
within eight years if the
target set by the Rector,
Eric Ash, is met.
Addressing the
Commemoration Day
ceremony in the Royal
Albert Hall yesterday
afternoon, the Rector called
upon female graduates to
spread the message that a
career as a scientist or
engineer offers an exciting
future, one that is just as
much for women as for
men. During Lord Flowers'
Rectorship the proportion
of woman had increased
from 9% to 17%, he said.
'To obtain a comparable
multiplying factor I have
until 1993 to increase this
proportion to 33%.'
Also in his address the
new Rector praised the
work of his predecessor
Lord Flowers, saying he
could only hope to emulate
his success. The College is
i he said, ready to meet the
I challenge of dual-funding,
and already derives almost
half its income from non-
U G C sources. This could
be done, he felt, without
jepordising pure science
research for which there
was no immediately
obvious industrial use.
Refering to the recent
Government green paper
on higher education he
welcomed the proposed
increase in students of
science and technology,
but went on to call for an
increase in the Science
vote, Government money
given to the Research
Councils.
The speech was a
contrast to the sharply-
worded attacks on
Government policy
delivered by Lord Flowers
at recent Commemoration
Days. It also revealed the
new Rector feels he has
some way to go before he
leaves the shadow of his
predecessor and stamps his
own authority and
personality on the College.
Small Unions
To Decline
Clive Jenkins, General
Secretary of ASTMS, spoke
to the Industrial Society on
Tuesday, predicting the
decline of small unions and
their replacement by larger
multi-trade unions. He also
foresaw training schemes
as a perminent feature of
employment and advocated
union representation in
decision-making in
preference to a purely
bargaining-based system.
Selkirk Again
A petition signed by most
of Selkirk and Tizard Hall
residents was handed to
Peter Hallworth, Managing
Surveyor of Residences, on
Wednesday. The petition
was submitted in support of
a letter to Mr Hallworth
objecting to the building of
staircase kitchens.
After the Warden's Sub-
Committee meeting on
Wednesday, Carl Burgess,
Union President, said that
'everyone is perfectly
willing for different plans to
be implemented' He added,
what is good for Falmouth-
Keogh Hall is not
necessarily good for Tizard
and Selkirk'. The matter will
be discussed at the
Students' Residence
Committee next
Wednesday.
DSES Robbery
Thieves escaped with a
tape deck, a number of
internal telephones, and
several half filled jars of
coffee after breaking into
the DSES building on
Sunday afternoon.
The thieves climbed
scaffolding at the rear of
the building and entered
through a third floor
window. Later that night an
intruder evaded police and
police dogs by escaping
over the roof.
The police have collected
fingerprints and footprints
and are awaiting forensic
evidence. Window locks
have now been fitted to the
building.
