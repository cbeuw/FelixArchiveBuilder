Teaching Standards
Imperial College is meant
to be one of the world's
leading Colleges of science
and technolgy. Students
come from all over the
world to be taught by some
of the leading academics
who are staff here. When
they come here, though,
they have to go through
incomprehensible and
boring lectures delivered by
staff who wish they were
researching rather than
teaching students. Not all
staff are to blame. Some
make great efforts to
ensure their lectures are
interesting. The majority
don't. The Union, the
Rector and many other
notables have recognised
the low teaching standards
in many departments. They
have set up promotion
systems designed to
encourage staff to improve
their teaching.
Unfortunately this has
failed to improve teaching
at IC. The reason for this is
quite simple. Many elderly,
senior academics don't
accept the need for
change. One Head of
Department refuses to
answer questions on his
course. How can he expect
his staff to worry about
their lecturing when he
obviously doesn't?
Members of staff as senior
as Head of Deparments
can't be sacked. They can
be replaced, though, when
their contracts come to an
end.
The Head of Department
should be someone with a
proven interest in student
teaching. College should
consider attracting
younger,more dynamic
Heads of Department so
that College develop a
reputation for being
interested in students.
Self Defence
Women interested in
going on a self defence
course should contact
Kathy in the IC Union
Office.
