Athletics
Appalling
Changeover
The crack elite squad
ventured forth to Motspur
Park last Sunday in an
unsuccessful attempt to
annihilate the other London
Colleges at the Inter
Collegiate Winter
Relays—five enthusiastic
athletes turned up at the
afore-mentioned event and
didn't win!
Alas, the ladies did not
turn out—hopefully due to
other commitments rather
than disinterest—and many
of our men were otherwise
employed, but Imperial
nevertheless did well.
In the field, Jon Gamblin
(dragged kicking and
groaning from bed little
more than an hour earlier)
competed well in all the
events available for the
men (shot/2nd/9.99m
HJ/6th/1.50m
Discus/2nd/26.26m) as did
Ming Tan (HJ/3rd/1 60m),
whilst Roger Lougney
improved his personal best
with each trial in Shot and
Discus and the Athletics
Sec proved once and for all
that he couldn't High Jump.
On the track in the team
5000m our men did us
proud with Mark Goldstone
coming 5th (17.32.7min)
and Jon Lea finishing a
clear 3rd (16.01.3) behind
Great Britain senior
international Mark Scrutton
who won in 14.25.5, hardly
breaking sweat!!! Alas we
couldn't collect any points
for this event (which cost
us dearly) because we
didn't have 'A team'—3
members.
Onto the Piece de
Resistance (the
biggy—please correct my
spelling Ed!) The 4 x 100m
relay (important because
Imperial won it!). Yes, that
highly tuned machine
comprising Roger,
Jonathan Gamblin (Mining
1—willing to accept
sponsorship negotiation by
appointment! He wanted a
mention!), John and Ming
displayed their
nanoseconds of specialist
training and, despite
appalling changeover, won.

B2 Club
Old Boys
Bar Staff, ex bar staff,
Footballer, Rugby player,
ex IC scrumhalf, President,
ex President or just in the
bars on Saturday
lunchtimes? All the above
have played or are playing
for the B2's but if you don't
fit into any of the above
categories, we'll make one
up for you.
The B2's are a side
composed of players whose
standard depends on
proximity to the ball, the
pack and scrum half being
good, the wings rubbish.
As many of us are 'old
boys' the pathetic excuses
of family matters often
leave us with 'the best side
that ever promised to turn
up' not appearing.
So if you fancy being
dragged from your bed at
1.45 on Saturdays for a
good social game of rugby
come and let any of the
staff in Southside Bar know
your address/phone no. No
salesman will call.

Phoenix
The centenary issue of the
Phoenix is currently in
production. We need
stories, poetry, art,
photographs etc produced

The subject matter is
entirely up to you. There is
a £40 cash prize for the
best submission. Deadline
is as soon as possible and
no later than the last week
of this term.
Drop completed work in
at the FELIX office or send
to Julian Curtis Maths 3.
Windsurfing
Bums
Yes folks, that bit of the
week between Friday and
Monday saw the IC
Windsurfing club beach-
bumming under a hot
Hawaiian sun in equatorial
Weymouth. Not even
Pascal Macca's 30 knot bid
at the world speed record
could match the IC WC's
performance in one of the
greatest windsurfing races
of this century. A
beautifully tactical display
of martial arts, by Pete
Drummond-Smith and his
board, wiped out half the
oppostion and gave IC an
excellent start. With shades
still in place Franour, ex-
captain, cruised cooly into
first place. Pippa Allen, our
present captain was the
first lady to glide over the
line, and Pete swifly
worked his way up the field
into fourth place. The world
speed record holder, Fred
Hayward, and the delightful
Jenna de-Rosnay were
nowhere to be seen.
With wine flowing and the
guitar playing into the early
hours, the IC Windsurfers hit
the beach to warm up after a
cool day's windsurfing. This
is what the kids want.
Guilds
100%
The past three weeks have
seen all the departmental
buffets come and go. These
have generally been a
tremendous success with
the majority of
undergraduates in all years
attending. Entertainment
was provided during the
sherry reception by guests
from the R C M and a
friendly RCS Jazz pianist.
Thanks to everyone who
had a part to play.
Monopoly Rag was not
very well supported
numerically but those who
came put 100 per cent
effort into tearing around
London after different
clues, having a lot of fun
and raising a large amount
of money for Mencap.
Thank you!
It has been encouraging
to see the number of
people who have stood for
social and academic
representatives. Come and
give your name to the
office so that we know how
to get in touch with you.
The first main meeting is
Tuesday 6.15pm in the
Union dining hall. All Soc-
reps, society chairman and
everyone else should be

the Union. So make any
views, opinions and
suggestions known to your
representatives beforehand.
This week there will be
the opportunity to get
tickets for Brighton on
Sunday 3 November. This
is a superb day watching
'Bo' compete in the veteran
car race, and having a
excellent meal together and
a good day at the seaside.
