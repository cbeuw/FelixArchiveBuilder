Oil is big business. But big
doesn't have to mean impersonal.
And that's where Mobil has the
edge. We're part of the third largest
oil corporation in the world - with all
the resources that implies - yet our
UK group of companies is efficiently
compact.
For graduates this can mean the
best of both worlds. We're large
enough to matter, yet small enough
to provide real opportunities forw
individual recognition and attention.
And for achievers, cross functional
movement is readily attainable. -
Our activities span the full range,
from exploration, production and
refining to distribution and marketing
- with, of course, very high levels of
professional management and
support staff.
But, whatever the activity, it's our
people that matter.
People with ability and ideas.
