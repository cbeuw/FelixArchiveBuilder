Dear Sir,
M r . Campbell's letters on the
philosophy of F r i e d r i c h Niet-
zsche cannot be allowed to
p a s s by without a few comments
from someone who-is reasonably
familiar with the writings o f
this remarable German thinker.
The writ-
ings of Nietzsche have little to
do with c l a s s or with race and
to describe him as a proto-Nazi
is a gross over-simplication.
Certainly, a s Bertrand R u s s e l l
wrote i n 1943, Nietzsche was,
with F i c h t e and Rousseau, a
" p r o g e n i t o r " of Nazism, in
that he advocates a semi-rigid
c l a s s structure dominated by an
aristocracy ( c o n s i s u n g o f a
union of " t o u g h and virile
elements").
Certainly, Nietzsche con-
tributed to the melting pot of
most philosophy out o f which
the twisted ideas of F a s c i s m
were to emerge - but so did
the writings o f many other phi 1-
o s o p h i e r s . So why choose Niet-
z s c h e , why not condemn Hobb-
es, the advocate of absolute
power, or P l a s o , who advocated
a far more rigid c l a s s structure
than did Nietzsche?
Obviously Mr. Campbell
thinks o f the "Uhermensch" i n
the same way as did the N a z i s ,
as a master race . T h i s i s rub-
b i s h , to put it bluntly, since
throughout N i e t z s c h i s writings,
while many things are difficult
to interpret (especially in "%jar-
cthusira") it i s always clear
to the objective reader that the
" Ubermensch" i s a moral b e i n g .
Indeed, Nietzsche strongly con-
demns the "breeding" o f men
or any other creature, since
such tampering, he thinks, can
only cause harm to the s p e c i e s .
A n d where i s the relevance of
h i s "social stratum", since his
v i e w s are entirely opposed to
those of the contemporary Ger-
man morole c l a s s , whose morals
and religion he continually con-
demns (eg, in "the Anti-Chr-
ist")?
The "blonde beast" i s a term
introduced in the "Towards a
Geneology of Morals" and refr-
ers to the animal aspect o f man,
dominant in the D i o n y s i a n , and
exemplified by the Homeric
Heroes. He sees the culture o f
A n c i e n t Greece as the sublima-
tion o f aggression, and the c u l -
ture o f recent times as the re-
sult o f C h r i s t i a n i t y , which has
tamed or suppressed the blonde
beast. T h i s must not be confus-
ed with Zarathustra's beast, the
State, which he condemns a s
strongly as the F a s c i s t s p r a i s -
e d And this is the lie
which creepeth out of the mouth
of the beast - I, the State, am
the people" - I quote here from
memory).
Furthermore, h i s viewpoint
is anti-Christian rather than
a n t i - s o c i a l i s t . Indeed, he has
very little to say about s o c i a l -
ism, except to condemn the
s o c i a l i s t for blaming his mis-
fortunes on society when the
fault i s primarily h i s own
"liurlight of the Fools" ch34
F i n a l l y , h i s views on race
bear no resemblance at a l l to
those of the N a z i s o r the Nat-
ional Front, he describes the
Germans a s "a people of the
most tremendous mixture and
mingling of races". Does Mr .
Campbell believe that H i t l e r
shared this view? N i e t z s c h e
goes on to condemn the nation-
a l i s t i c and racial prejudices of
his countrymen as "attacks of
stupididy" and describes the
fears a s "the strongest, tough-
est and purest race at present
living in Europe" - according
to M r . C a m p b e l l ' s hypothesis,
the logical conclusion for Hit-
ler, i f he was indeed a d i s c i p l e
of N i e t z s c h e , would have been
to choose the J e w s as his mas-
ter race.

Dear Sir,
I feel that I must protest at
the p i c k e t i n g of the N . F . meet-
ing on Wednesday. H a v i n g been
unable to stop the N . F . booking
a room, the S o c i a l i s t s obvious-
ly decided to make i t very em-
barassing for anyone o f whatev-
er p o l i t i c s to attend. Not only
was it necessary to push thro-
ugh a large body o f people,
but also to be subjected to som-
one taking flash-photos o f a l l
people entering the meeting.
Not satisfied with that, photos
were taken through the g l a s s
door of the N . F . meeting .
I was amazed at the way
the meeting o f the joint Comm-
ittee against R a s c i s m and
F a s c i s m was conducted. T h i s
seemed to c o n s i s t o f a dialog-
ue between various left and ex-
treme left members o f the U n i o n .
It looked rehearsed - had i t been,
or does i t come naturally after
many similar meetings? One
communist would ask a question
and another wpuld answer. T h i s
seemed the general case apart
from one or two diversions such
as demands for apologies from
F E L I X e t c .
It makes a change to have
some p o l i t i c a l activits a t I . C ,
it i s a pity that i t has to be of
such an abnoxious form .It must
have left a number of people
with a s i c k feeling i n the
stomach .
Yours Sincerely

The problem:
According to current theory, rotating black holes are the actual gateways to
other regions in spacetime. How therefore could a space vehicle pass through a
rotating black hole into another region of spacetime without being crushed by
the gravitational field of a singularity?
A n y solution o r theory offered should not only account for present relativistic phenomena,
hut forecast new observations and suggest experiments ultimately leading to practical
engineering solutions. It is likely that the developed mathematical equations will be complex
tensor matrices that link the fundamental forces. Candidates will need to be familiar with
Kerr's solution to Einstein's 1916 field equations, with K r u s k a l diagrams o f spacetime and
with related w o r k . Serious candidates will be provided with all necessary reference material
a n d with c o m p u t i n g facilities if needed.

reputation that far transcends the cash value of the prize.
