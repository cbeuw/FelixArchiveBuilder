Gene C l a r k : N o O t h e r
(Asylum SYL 9 0 2 0 )
F o r those of you who cannot place the
name, cast your mind back 70 years or s o
ago. Three men J i m Mcguim, David C r o s -
by, and Gene C l a r k started playing toget-
her and the legend of the Byrds was born.
Gene left the band in 1966 and disappear-
ed in almost total oblivion for several
years before reappearing on the disappoin-
ting Byrds reunion album. Since then he
has toured a s part of Roger (name change
from Jim) Mogiun backing band and has
spent months preparing for this album.
The album took s i x month's to record
and even with a new producer the cont-
ains many of the best q u a l i t i e s originally
found in the Byrds m u s i c . Perhaps some
of this may be due to the i n c l u s i o n of a n -
other ex Byrd; C h r i s H i l l m a n amongst the
long list of baclancy m u s i c i a n s . The har-
mony i s s t i l l there although unfortunately
polluted with too many "Yeah Yeah
Girls". The i n s t r u m e n t a l have advanced
along way s i n c e those far off days, but
have changed much for the better. There
are some magnificient s o l o s thrashed out
in 'Lifes Greates Fool' and 'No Other'
and in what is perhaps the best rack
'Silver Raven' the piercing s h r i l l notes

Pierre Boulle: Monkey Planet(Penguin)
This book chronicles the fate of the
first intersellar expedition to the unknown
region of A l p h a O n o n i s (Betelgeuse to
you). T h e journey i s completed i n t w o
years (ship time) d u e to relataristic
effects. Soon after arrival at Betelgeuse
they find a planet very like earth with an
eminently breathable oxygen/nitrogen
atmosphere. A smooth landing on the
planet, christened Soror, follows a n a r i e l
survey showing that the surface of the
gla net h a s been moulded by rational
eings.
However, a shock awaits our intrepid
heroes! (Gosh, what can it be). 'Homo
sapiens here was nothing but a naked
animal'. (The question a r i s e s that does
an animal that cannot talk merit the title
s a p i e n s ) . 'The master race were Apes:
Apes that dressed like men and hunted
humans for their sport'.
Y e s , folks y o u guessed i t ! It's the
book that gave the film (that gave four
more films) that resulted in the T V series
'Planet of the Apes'. T o o many films are
being expanded into T V s e r i e s . Enough
s a i d about that.
The book w a s actually bearable. I
clearly felt the deep message that lurks
below the surface of the plot in a l l
worthwhile Science F i c t i o n .
conjur up a perfect image of a bird sweep-
ing.
T h i s is an excellent album which is
going to suffer (unfortunately) from under
publicity and I feel it w i l l be "an ideal
candidate in the years to come tar as one
that should have made it" .

Out Of The Storm: Jack Bruce (RSO)
For those of you who can recall hear-
ing the name before but cannot quite re-
member where - Manfred Mann; formed the
rock group, Cream with E r i c Clapton and
Ginger Baker and was Bruce in the high-
ly s u c c e s s f u l rock band, Bruce and
L a i n g .
"Out of The Storm" is an album main-
ly bassed on guitar, bass and drums rock
t r i o . The album i s well composed; the
music Is pleasant and has definite over-
tones resulting from jazz and blues i n -
fluence. Steve Hunter, who worked with
A l i c e Cooper and L o u Reed plays a l l the
guitar work and drums are shared by J i m
Kettner and J i m Gordon .
J a c k has written a l l the music and
plays the bass with his customary mast-
ery (nowhere is this more apparent than
i n , " T i m e s l i p " , the last t r a c k ) .
J a c k and Pete Brown (an a s s o c i a t i o n
which goes back to the Cream days) have
written the l y r i c s , which are on thw whole
good and sometimes are "mind blowing".
The album is good without being
b r i l l i a n t .
S t o r m b r i n g e r : D e e p P u r p l e
Side one starts with the sort of music
one does not normally a s s o c i a t e with
Deep Purple in s o much a s it Is much
too slow moving. T h i s however does not
imply that the music is bad, far from i t .
The first three tracks are full of some
exceptional music on the guitar a s w e l l
as some simulated Stevie Wonder touch-
es to the vocals, whilst the chorus on
the third track has that E l t o n stamp
about i t .
The last track has the good old Deep
Purple rhythm and gets your feet taping.
Side two starts with real Deep Purple
stuff and the first track has bone shak-
ing and fast moving rhythm. T h i s is fol-
lowed by some reverberating guitar
which has that " f o u r beat r h y t h m " to it
and gets rather monotonous. This side
comes to a climax with a good d i s c o
track having a continuous and inspiring
rhythm which Is easy to follow and hen-
ce dance to .
The last two tracks are somewhat
disappointing and are again slower mov-
ing . The last one being about a "Sold-
ier of fortunes" and very slow moving
indeed for Deep Purple .However the
album i s well arranged and makes pleas-
ant listening.
It is a good buy for everyone and i s
an absolute must for Deep Purple fans.
H.B. Greenhouse Premonitions -
A Leap Into the Future (Pan)
T h i s book purports to report a large
number of documented c a s e s of premonit-
ions, a s k i n g the question: "It they had
been heeded could disasters have been
averted." While I found the book interest-
ing it was a l s o unnerving .While travelling
by rail I read the chapter concerning pre-
dictions of train crashes and nearby got off
the train at the first a v a i l a b l e s t o p . It d e -
finitely encouraged spooky feelings .
The documentation on a great deal of
the cases was very impressive, but on oth-
ers it was sketchy. Sometimes inferences
are drawn which are questionable, and
o c c a s i o n a l l y downright unfounded.
It is however a fascinating book, well
worth the investment if you are interested.

H.G. Wells: The Invisible Man (Fontana)
When I picked up this book I thought it
would be old fashioned and tedious. Grant-
ed the style i s somewhat easier, the pace
slower, than is today's fashion but once
the story was underway I found it very read-
able .
It has been s a i d that good s c i e n c e fic-
tion starts with one impossible (or improb-
able) premiss and the story should follow
from that with no further implausability.
W e l l s ' story does this . The style easily
makes you believe in the plausability of
the idea that a man could make himslef i n -
v i s i b l e . H e even explains why no-one has-
done it s i n c e .

Voices In an Empty Room
Philip Loriane
I H A D previously read one of h i s e a r l -
ier books, '7he Mafia Kiss', a highly
entertaining b o o k . ' V o i c e s In An Empty
Room' has proved to be of the same good
quality though it is a rather unusual psy-
c h i c thriller.
The plot is an intricate one and the
reader i s carefully s e t up for a totally
unexpected ending. The plot is woven
round E l l i e Spenser who is the love of
John Lamb who begins to get more than a
little worried when on a business trip he
v i s i t s her in San F r a n c i s c o and finds not
only her behaviour strange but a l s o her
actions .
He sets out to try and find out, but be-
fore too long he comes up against Mrs
A m e l i a Guardi and the medium L u l u . Why
are they in San F r a n c i s c o and why esp-
e c i a l l y at E l l i e ' s U n c l e s ' s house . The i n -
trigue of family history past and present
form the basis of a rather c h i l l i n g thriller
about the obsession to bring back the past
by one woman who i s not a l l she seems.
Well recommended.
