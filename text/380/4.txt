"WHY?" I c a n hear many of you a s k i n g ,
and a good question it is t o o . I feel that
1 have two main qualification for the j o b .
(i) Organisational Ability: I am u s e d to
working with and leading a team of work-
ers and have had quite a lot of organisa-
tional experience in my H a l l of Residence
aid R C S Union during my three years here.
I a l s o know a little of the present organ-
isation of I C U .
(W)Representational Ability: I have a l -
ready been representing a large group of
students and have become used to commi-
ttee work, both Union and C o l l e g e . I am a
sociable person by nature and find it easy
to mix with people and obtain their opin-
ions on student affairs.
The main areas on which I would l i k e
the Union to concentrate next year are the
following.
(a) Lecturing Standards: F o r some time
we nave been trying to get improvements
In the standard of lecturinq which varies
from reasonable to downright appalling.
We must press for more lecturers to talce
courses on how to lecture and to u s e v i s -
ual aids e t c . We should, I think, push for
lecturers to be chosen on teaching a b i l i t y
as w e l l a s research a b i l i t i e s .
(b) Accommodation: Many of our s t u d -
ents are faced with living a long distance
from college In accommodation which Is
quite unsuitable for students and at very
high rents. The Union must be able to help
In this area, perhaps by trying to run a n
Accommodation Bureau for much longer
each year; and a l s o perhaps through ob-
taining short life accommodation from
L o c a l . C o u n c i l s .
(c) Union Clubs: T h i s seems to be the
way in which most people at College are
Involved with their U n i o n . I should like
to s e e the Union going out to the C l u b s
more and trying to get some of the people
involved in the central Union work.
(d) Postgraduates: These suffer from
special problems which I feel many of us
do not understand, I should like to invest-
igate these and try to help solve some of
these.
Well, it seems my words must come to
an end, leaving me with many unsung
ideas. P l e a s e a s k me anything you would
like my views o n . Thanks for reading this
far.

IT IS quite clear that the position of
Honorary Secretary of Imperial C o l l e g e
Union involves a great deal of day-toxiay
running of Union affairs . T h e Hon.Sec .
has to s i t on many and varied committees,
often taking minutes a s w e l l a s represent-
ing student opinion. Beyond that, the H o n .
S e c . must co-ordinate the a c t i v i t i e s of
those committees responsible to the Union
(for example, Union Finance Committee)
and must ensure that each is playing i t s
proper role within the college.
T h i s , in itself, i s a full-time j o b . T o
quote our present secretary:
"I'm quite fully occupied lust keeping
things ticking over."
In addition, however, the Hon.Sec. has
a number of less tangible r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s .
T h e s e include backina up the dep. reps,
encouraging union officers (including the
president!) and, of course, supportiug
many of the C o l l e g e ' s s o c i a l functions.
L a s t l y , the Hon S e c . must be
approachable. H e - or she, for that matt-
er - is the sole representative of the
Union of some committees, a n d must
therefore be diplomatic and responsive .
I believe that my experience in I . C . U .
and R . S . M . affairs would help me in carry-
ing out these duties. I have been involved
in a wide range of a c t i v i t i e s in college
and have held posts on the following com-
mittees: C o u n c i l (Carnival Co-ordinator),
C a r n i v a l Committee (Chairman), R . S . M .
C o u n c i l (acting Dep. Rep.), R.S.M. E n t s
Committee (Revue Organiser), Tizard H a l l
Committee (Chairman 74/75, and E n t s
Officer 73/74), and on the Departmental
Academic Affairs Committee (2 years). I
feel that s u c h a broad range of interests
is essential if the Secretary is to do h i s
job effectively.
I believe I have shown myself to be
efficient and effective in my previous
posts and that I have the abulity and ex-
perience to do a good job a s next year's
I . C . U . Hon . S e c .

I have spen four years at college, i n -
cluding one year at K i n g s College read-
ing Mechanical Engineering before de-
c i d i n g that I w a s d i s s a t i s f i e d with the
course and moving to IC to study M e t a l -
urgy .In my time here I have held the
post of P u b l i c i t y Officer for the Enter-
tainments Committee and achieved the
d i z z y heights of chairman this year. In
undertaking these positions I have had
the opportunity of s i t t i n g on various
committees and on o c c a s i o n s have been
asked to attend Counci I.
The job of Hon .Sec. is b a s i c a l l y
that of administration; it not only envol-
ves the day to day running of the union
office but a l s o the very important task
of sitting on a multitude of committees
as your representative.
I think the opinions I hold are in line
with that of the average student and in
having no strong political bias my views
w i l l not in any way interfer with the job .
I would imagine that most of you have
probably been to one or more of the
events organised by the E n t s Committee
and have doubtless formed an opinion of
my organisational a b i l i t i e s even if you
don't like the Heavy Metal K i d s . A s E n t s
Chairman apart from gaining experience
in dealing with the cut throat business
world I have a l s o spent a great deal of
time in the union office and have come to
appreciate the problems involved with
the post of Hon . S e c .
Let me conclude by saying that if I
am elected, I am elected to represent
yourviews and interests, which I w i l l d o
to the best of my a b i l i t y . If you d o not
think I am suitable for the post please
either vote for another candidate or
write abstain on your paper, but for the
Unions sake P L E A S E V O T E !

A s I wrote in my bumph-sheet, F E L I X
should have more news in it .One way' of
accomodating this news would be to
have It on the back page. In addition I
feel there is a need for more feature
articles and guides, (to appear in the
first few issues of the autum term),
which help to spotlight the places, in
the South Kensington area, where stud-
ents c a n get reasonably priced clothes,
food, equipment e t c .
The Editor has a n important role to
play a s coordinator of IC media and I
would cooperate fully with them, in
u t i l i s i n g a l l a v a i l a b l e means at our d i s -
posal to improve the service we provide.
More coordination i s required on the
production s i d e , s o that more time c a n
be spent on editing and layout d e s i g n .
T h i s would help to improve the quality
of F E L I X . I intend to deal with this pro-
blem by getting more staff.
T o overcome the acute shortage of
staff that now e x i s t s , I would try to neg-
otiate for more places in hall for F E L I X
staff. T h i s would not only serve a s an
incentive for recruitment purposes but
w i l l a l s o allow F E L I X more coverage of
IC news a s and when it o c c u r s .
With the experience I have gained
working on F E L I X this year I think I am
the person most suited for the job. A s
Editor I shall work hard and be a v a i l -
able A L L of the time (you can't m i s s
the fuzz!) .
I shall be available in my room (Gar-
den 43) or Maths department if anyone
wants to d i s c u s s further, the issues I
have raised . Please make sure you
exercise your right to VOTE.

Since coming to IC C l i v e Dewey has
been heavily involved with the media
here. In h i s first year he w a s a F E L I X
photographer a s well as a producer/pre-
senter for S T O I C . In January 1974 he
became a founder member of Imperial
C o l l e g e Radio, for whom he is now a
Station Manager.
O l i v e ' s main interest this year has
been the student press. H e started the
year a s an A s s i s t a n t Editor of F E L I X ,
but soon moved on to S E N N E T . Here
he has played a n active part in the News
and Advertising departments . T h i s term
he has written regularly in both the re-
views and features sections of the paper.
C l i v e therefore has a good deal of
varied journalistic experience, which
w i l l stand him in good stead if he be-
comes F E L I X E d i t o r .
A s Editor C l i v e ' s first priority w i l l
be to improve the news service. News
w i l l be geared more to IC, be more a c c -
urate and strictly f a c t u a l . Improvements
w i l l not stop there; C l i v e intends start-
ing a weekly four page What's On p u l l -
