T H E F A C T that the challenge for the
presidency of Imperial C o l l e g e Union
has been unopposed could exert a prof-
oundly detrimental influence on die more
practical aspects of the forthcoming
I C U e l e c t i o n s . T h e fact that there w i l l
have to be a separate C o l l e g e - w i d e
ballot fot the post of Deputy President
(for neither of the two present c a n d i d -
ates were fully seconded when the
nomination papers came down last Mond-
ay at 5p.m.) seriously exacerbates the
s i t u a t i o n .
Constitutionally, in the election of
the President. Deputy President. Hon.
Secretary and Editor of F E L I X , a thres-
hold of over 1.000 voters has to be
reached for the election to be v a l i d .
Now election interest from the voters'
point of view has traditionally focussed
on the race for the presidency. T h i s
year there can be no such race .
Are the contests lor Hon .Sec.and
the Editorship of FELIX going to hold
enough interest for the voters' so that
that 1,000 ballot-paper threshold can be
reached0
The answer i s simply: T h i s
can be so. It i s up to those with the re-
sources at their disposal to put out
" V o t e ! " - type p u b l i c i t y . A n d it i s ap-
propriate to ask the OCT.' E x e c u t i v e s to
exhort their cohorts as much as poss-
ible to go out and vote for the sake of
IC" Union.
*
A point which has to be made public-
ally, however inopportune the moment
may be, i s that the F F L I X cat motifs
seen on some current electioneering
bumph are being used without permis-
sion. T h i s i s a regrettable state of
affairs .

Did I not tell you so, Trevor7
Regard-

made over a snooker game in the small
hours late last summer, I make it £1
that you owe me !

I must apologise severally to some
of the contributors to the letters column
this week for having to cut chunks out
of their communications in order that
they might fit the space available .The
two letters regarding N i e t z s c h e were
e s p e c i a l l y long. One hopes that such
letters on the subject in the future are
kept as brief as possible.
A Nietzsche in time ?

Dear Sir,
During the one and a half
years that I have been at this
college I have noted with inter-
est the strange and ostensibly
emotional involvement many
male students have with Mr Got-
t l e i b ' s game of p i n b a l l . I would
l i k e therefore with your leave,
to examine this phenomenon
using the much ridiculed and
maligned, though b a s i c a l l y cor-
rect, techniques and theories
of psycho-analysis developed
by Jung, Freud and the more
obscure T . Endur.
It does not require very deep
a n a l y s i s to expose the motiva-
tion o f this 'same' . The pinball
machine i s merely an extension
of the phallus, w h i l s t the oper-
ation of the flippers ( n i p p l e s 1
)
with passionately convulsive
p e l v i c thrusts i s a sub-con-
scious sexual intercourse.
A t t a i n i n g an orgasm i s thinly
disguised as the 'replay'; die
'tilt' when exuberant thrusting
has affected the machine i s the
selfish premature ejaculation
due to insufficient selfcontrol.
The cacophanous bells and
buzzers and die Hashing lights
of the submissive, reclining
machine all serve to hold re-
served for the beauty of the
female b o d y . P t n b a l i has be-
come a primitive sex substitute.
How often do you see women
'playing the silver ball' and
have your readers never been
struck by the incongruity of
this sight?
I think that my observations
w i l l make clear to many of
your more sensitive readers the
truly primitive nature ot the
lusts and desires of many stud-
ents a t our illustrious college.
The promulgation of the image
of the Imperial student as a
beer drinking, p i n b a l l playing,
super-virile male and the com-
petition between rival factions
within the college for suprem-
acy I find pitiful! and nauseous.
1 hope that ill) a n a l y s i s , the
truth o f which cannot be doubt-
ed, w i l l serve to lead those who
are penitent, towards the path
of truth, beauty and virtue,
Floreat C o l l e g i u m !

Dear Fditor,
Whilst avidly reading the
last issue of F E L I X I noticed
that under the heading of
• ' R C S l ' C a n d i d a t e s " my name
was omitted from the list o f
candidates for the post of Hon-
orary Secretary of the Royal
College of Science Union. 1
hope this letter w i l l rectify
this sad s i t u a l i o n .
Yours electioneeringly,

Dear Sir,
On reading through the ted-
ious verbage of Mr. C a m p b e l l ' s
letter, FELIX. So. 379. two
main ideas emerge. The first i s
that N i e t z s c h e was a member of
the German middle-class and a s
such his writing reflected their
desires and frustrations, the
second concerns the doctnne of
the "Superman' .
The first reveals how Mr.
Campbell goes hand in glove
with the N a z i ' s i n trying to re-
duce a philosophical idea down
to the level of p o l i t i c a l post-
uring . F o r though Nietzsche
was born into the c l a s s system
he lived his life alone and as
an outsider, and his writing
never reflects an\ bias that can
he considered to he caused by
elds preiudices. He saw throu-
gh the tenuous social and moral
codes and in transcending
these systems ot \alues he
found himself in an intellectual
v o i d . C o l i n Wilson who in his
book "The Outsider" says o f
Nietzsche, "For the Outsider,
the world into whichhe has
been born, is a world without
values. Compared to his own
appetite for a purpose and dir-
ection, the way most men live
is not living at all, it is drift-
ing. This is the Outsider's
wretchedness Unless he
can evolve a set of values
that will correspond to his own
higher intensity of purpose, he
may as well throw himself un-
der a bus ... '. However, Niet-
zsche viewed life positively
and set himself the immense
task of climbing to new mental
heights of perception and under-
standing and as he himself
writes in "This spoke Zarath-
ustra" . "Not the heights, but
the drop is terrible. That pre-
cipice into which the glance
falls down while the hand
gropes up .. .''
" t / i Will clings lo man, with
chains I bind muself to man,
because I am drawn upwards
towards the 'Superman', thither
tends my other Will."
T h i s brings me to the most
important point: Mr Campbells
interpretation of the "Super-
man" which i s s o far from the
truth that it shows how profound
his lack of understanding is!
No doubt a small portion of the
blame could be attributed to
the use of the word Superman'
which arouses misconceptions
on Darwinian lines i ,e . a higher
form of life to supercede 'home
sapiers' however Nietzsche has
unambiguously repudiated this
in "Ecce Homo".
"To over throw idols,{idols
is the name I give to all i d e a l s ) '
is much more my business . In
proportion as an ideal has been
falsely worshipped, reality has
been robbed of its value, its
meaning and if: truthfulness..."
Or in other words the Super-
man is not a tall bronze-skinn-
ed god but a man who overth-
rows idols such a s these.
N i e t z s c h e ' s works metap-
horically use words like war
and battle to describe the c l a s h
