" T h e largest event of its
kind in the w o r l d , " the 27th
annual invitation Hyde Park
Road Relay produced a record
entry of 104 teams, of which
93 started. After the cust-
omary last-minute trauma,
when we discovered that no
officials had turned up, and
with the aid of a stopwatch
kindly lent to us by Cologne
University, the first-lap stam-
pede sped its way around the
3-mile lap o f the Serpentine.
The first two laps saw
London University in the
lead, closely followed by
Birmingham, Oxford and Cam-
bridge . However, with only a
finite number of illegal run-
ners, London fell back, to be

Regarding the presidency,
SJirightman admitted his i n -
ability to lift Theta, while dur-

candidate, DJRawnsley threw
an egg apparantly for a yolk!
After the withdrawal of B .
Causey for VP, J.White was
elected unapposed, as was J .
Holding for the post of A.A.O.
D. A n s e l l withdrew from the
Hon. S e c . candidature, leaving
four contestants. M.Roe was
described as efficient, and
would endeavour to see that
the U n i o n ran smoothly. D.Sal-
isbury declined to show his
patellas, but h i s proposer pro-
vided a glimpse o f this inimit-
able knee power! T . T u t u
attempted to mesmerise us
with his beautiful proposer and
described himself as a cross
between Shaft, Superfly and
N i x o n Another aspect of get-
ting more involved in Union
activities, was highlighted by
A.Sudworth.
Finally, for the post of Hon.
J u n . Tres., Ms C M o r r e l sup-
ported her campaign with such
slogans as "Chris for cash",
and " Integrity or bust", while
D.Rawnsley said he would try
to increase the R C S goods

replaced by the eventual win-
ners, Birmingham, who broke
the course record for good
measure, in 83.20, and one of
their team, Ray Smedley,
equalled the lap record in 13.

The next team home re-
presented a motley group of
insurance agents, con men
and the l i k e , running under
the guise of the London Sch-
ool of Navigation, who were
disqualified, for not running
bona-fide students, a defini-
tion hotly debated in the bar
afterwards.
T h i s disqualification gave
Borough Road College second
place and the Steve Webb
R a l l y Trophy: this meant that
they did not qualify for the
L a d y Roderic H i l l Cup, for
the first college team home
with sub. 500 male students
in the college, which turned
out to be Queens' College,
Cambridge, in 16th place.
Some ten minutes behind
the winners, 33rd in 93.17,
were the home team, Imperial
College All-Stars ( Ian E l l i s
15.14, Steve Webb 1(5.17, Rob
A l l i n s o n 14.44, P a u l C l a r k e
15.32, Dave Jones 15.49,
Tony Weir 16.40). For the
first time in years, we beat
the O l d L a g s and Ancients
team, who finished 57th.
Another of the suspicious
teams whose runners raised
many an eyebrow amongst the
organisers were the Royal
C o l l e g e of M u s i c . Under the
doubtful captaincy of M . F u l -
ler (non-runner), such famous
runners as A.Barcerseyaritch,
Freddie B r i s c o e (no relation
to Frank), A O d d and L . L u s t ,
whose musical talents extend
no further than singing in the
Union Bar, the R C M finished
17th and only 26s separated'
them from Queens', Cambridge,
and the destiny o f the L a d y
Roderic H i l l C u p .
Bringing up the rear were
Mons (for die 3rd successive
year): four of their runners
broke 20 minute barrier (and,
rumour has it, the 20-pint
barrier in the evening). The
wooden spoon, presented in
absentio, goes to a mystery
Sussex runner, who ran 23.12.
