The extras arrived at Har-
lington with a full side and
awaited the arrival o f O l d
Suttoniary while Max Wrizley
entertained us with his latest
hit " H a v e n ' t They C a n c e l l e d
Y e t " .
F i n a l l y the opposition
arrived but with only eleven
men, two volunteers were ask-
ed to play for them and R.Sut-
ton and G.Davies did the hon-
ours .
The game was more a run
around for most of the game
with I C scoring continually.
Although at the start of the
second half Old Sultonians
put up a fight.
The final score was 82-10
for IC (half time 40-6)
Scorers were:- S.Aspden
(2), S f h u d y , A . D a v i e s , T .
F e a m (2), M.Gibson, J Hughes
(3), S . L a d l e (3), M S a n s o n
(3) A.N.Other. Conversions
S.Hoyle, T . F e a m (6).
G.Daviees scored for the
opposition a n d the O.S. Capt-
tain s a i d that he thought both
Gwyn and R i c h Sutton played
very w e l l .
The front five although
they didn't score played very
well obtaining set piece ball '
and supporting the attacks, P .
Jeffs was prominant in that
he was only a few yards from
the scorer at a l l the I C tries.
A good time was had by a l l
e s p e c i a l l y since half the side
were p i s s e d the night before.

The semifinal o f the U . L U . premier league cup between Imper-
i a l College l s t XI and K i n g s College IstXI took place finally at
Hadington on Wednesday the 19th . I . C . hoping to make i t a double
final date at Motspur Park, already having their second team thr-
ough in the reserves cup, fielded a full strength side and started
the game clear favourites.
Unlike their league en-
counter a fortnight ago, our
lads refused to let K i n g s dom-
inate the midfield in the open-
ing stages but harrassed con-
tinually and forced the oppos-
ition to squander their poss-
e s s i o n on many occasions.
Our attacks were not very
frequent but we were content
for the time being to c o n s o l i -
date our position a t the back
and allow the K i n g s middle
men to tie themselves out
with fruitless running. Inspite
of this the best chance of the
half s t i l l came our way when
Glen Swaby chipped a brilli-
ant free kick over a defensive
w a l l at the edge of the pen-
alty area for Steve Bates to
run onto. Making a tremendous
lunge for it, however, he was
only able to hit the ball wide
with just the keeper to beat.
The first half thus ended a s
it had started, really a stale-
mate a l l round.
The second half was a d i f f e r
ent story for both sides came
out determined to make the
vacant place at Motspur Park
theirs .IC attacked solidly for
the first ten minutes but could
find no way through a well
d i s c i p l i n e d defence and it
was eventually left to the
K i n g s full back to break the
deadlock. With the ball at his
feet he ran a full 30 yards un-
challenged towards the I C
defence before letting fly
from well outside the a r e a .
The whole I C side stood root-
ed to watch the ball loop into
the far comer o f the goal giv-
ing K e v A l l e n no chance.
Having been behind on
several occasions this seas-
on but s t i l l succeeding in
winning we picked up our
heads and decided we were-
n't going to lose without a
fight. Our midfield men be-
gan switching the ball from
left to right and sending in
some w i c k e d crosses for the
K i n g s defence to deal with.
Glen Swaby then hit across an
inch perfect cross ball to
Bruce Woodman who nodded
the ball past the K i n g s
keeper to put us back in the
game .
And so the score remained
for the next twenty minutes
until a minute from time,
when everyone had resigned
themselves to an extra half
hours play, up popped the
K i n g s contre half to shoot
from the edge of the area and
put his side into the final for
the first time for years.

IC I S T X I vs A S H F O R D 1ST X I
After our recent successful run, I C travelled out to Ashford
last Saturday confident o f yet another victory. Unfortunately things
didn't go according to p l a n . A bad dose of plague kept Captain
Stitch in bed (at least that's what he told us) and this left us with
out an umpire. L u c k i l y Ashford were able to provide an extra um-
pire!! After the usual democra-
tic procedure the " F u h r e r "
took over as captain for the day
and the match began on time.
IC quickly found themselves a
goal up when a through ball
from A d o l f was p i c k e d up by
Superstar and his shot was
k i c k e d off the line by an A s h -
ford defender. Mr P . F . himself
nonchalently converted the re-
sulting penalty. After this early
setback Ashford exerted a great
deal o f pressure withouf ever
seriously troubling the I C de-
fence. However, just before
half time a mis-hit shot fooled
the I C defence and trickled i n -
to the net for Ashford's equal-
iser. The second half continued
the same way a s the first with
Ashford applying most o f the
pressure without creating any
clear-cut chances. The best
chances fell to the I C forwards
but unfortunately too many mis-
takes were made with the final
p a s s . Mid-way through the half
Ashford scored what proved to
be the winning goal when a n -
other mis-hit shot trickled over
the goal line . D e s p i t e applying
some sustained pressure in the
last few minutes IC could not
force an equaliser.
The whole IC" defence play-
ed extremely well particularly
both full b a c k s , Jim Marshall
and Mike Vieyra . However, the
midfield concentrated too much
on defence and, a s a result,
not enough support was given
to the forwards who when given
the chance tore the Ashford de-
fence apart.
Special thanks must go to
Richard Cameron who came
along to spectate.

2nd XI
On Saturday the 2nd XI took
to the field against Ashford
2nd '48. With vague rememb-
rances o f goals galore in our
previous match the team were
eager for further glory.
The enthusiasm at least,
was s t i l l apparent i n the open-
ing 35 minutes with I C rampant
in attack, supported ably i n
mid f i e l d , (especially F . T a n
whose dextrous stickwork left
the opposition standing).
The defense was seldom
tested, but was nevertheless
efficient when c a l l e d upon. N o
goals came for a l l the effort
though, although Andrew Brew-
ster went close (good to have
you back Andy). C h a s Hardy
struck some useful short c o m -
ers, but was denied even the
penalty flick which he deserv-
ed.
John Huckle opened the
second half with a demonstra-
tion of how easy it i s to get
ones stick caught between
ones legs. (Next time you m i -
ght give the performance out-
side the ' D ' John). The umpire
appreciated the display a s did
the opposition when they
scored from the resulting pen-
alty corner.
After this I C appeared to
give up and the pressure was
taken off the Ashford defense.
I C were unlucky not to be
awarded a penalty flick, two
penalty corners and countless
long corners, but then we cant
be perfect can w e umpire?
Many thanks to all those
who played out o f position
without grumbling, e s p e c i a l l y
Shane Mead.
