KENSINGTON
UNIVERSITY ?
The possibility of I.C. breaking away from
the University of London as a University of Ken-
sington came under discussion at the recent Board
of Studies meeting, held on 23rd September.
The Rector, Lord Penney, presented a paper to the BoSt
which would form the basis of the College's submission to a
Committee of enquiry into the governance of the University
of London. This committee, set up by U L , is chaired by
Lord Murray of Newhaven.
The Rector's paper itself said little, and proposed few
concrete changes in the U L structure. It comprised mainly
woolly statements like reform of the membership of the U L
Senate. Although this is theoretically the supreme academic
body, it is really a rubber stamp for the decisions of its
standing committees, such as Academic Council and Colle-
giate Council. Also, he wants a broadening of the member-
ship of Senate standing Committees — at present most of
these bodies are composed of members already on Senate,
and I C is not represented as such an Academic Council.
Penney also advocated reduction in the powers of Convoca-
tion.
N O S T A M P
The paper also made comments on such matters as student
and junior staff participation, external degrees, the U L
schools Examinations Council, and Court (which controls
finances).
The comment on participation stressed college-based
representation. However, I C U has asked that this be ex-
tended to state that participation is necessary also at the
federal level.
For once, Board of Studies members would not just
rubber-stamp the proposals — their comments are to be
incorporate in a further document, and the Rector will give
Lord Murray both his own opinions and those expressed
at the BoSt, in October, and will report back in December.

Various members of the Board then voiced their opinions
that IC should secede from the University of London. The
secessionists were led by Professors Spalding and Ubbehlode,

NEW STYLE REFECTORY
A completely new
type of refectory is to
open shortly in the
ground floor dining
room, Southside, to re-
place the basement
cafeteria and the snack
bar. The new refectory
will serve a wide range
of foods, with better
facilities for cheap
meals than before.
Last year, the basement
cafeteria made a disastrous
£13,000 loss, due to a de-
cline in the numbers wanting
cafeteria type meals. A t the
same time the Southside
Snack Bar (serving sand-
wiches etcetera) and the Col-
lege Block Buttery (serving
pie and chips, etcetera) were
very overcrowded.

was thought up to alleviate
these problems, and it is
also hoped to bring back
custom lost to places outside
during last year. The South-
side Cafeteria will serve a
large range of meals, includ-
ing salads, sandwiches, pie
and chips, and hot cafeteria
type meals. The layout is a
multiple access arrangement,
the customer walks to join
one of the four queues at the
four main counters, and
after getting his meal goes
straight to one of the three
cashdesks. In this way there
should be no long queue
trailing round all the coun-
ters, and so service should be
fairly fast.
The design of the cafe-
teria is very flexible — it will
be very easy to extend one
counter and reduce another
if one type of meal is more
popular than another, and
it is possible that changes
will be made as soon as it
becomes clear what custo-
mers prefer.
The kitchens will now be
on one level only, with the
new cafe and the staff din-
ing room behind it, as
opposed to the former two-
level kitchens. This will
make Southside more econo-
mical to run.
In the evening, the full
range of services should
again be available. In addi-
tion a corner of the dining
hall will be screened off and
an a la carte waitress service
will be provided here. This
will be similar to the pre-
vious Southside evening
waitress service dining hall,
but of smaller capacity.
For the moment, the snack
bar and basement cafeteria
will be put into mothballs. In
a few years time, thought
will be given to re-opening
them to cope with the ex-
pected increase in numbers
of students. The basement
dining room may also be
used for conferences, break-
fasts, etc.
At the time of writing, it
does not seem clear whether
the new multi-access cafe-
teria will be ready by the
start of the term, but it
should be operational by
October 12. Arrangements
for Southside before then
seem a bit hazy.
One point to note — the
stairs leading to the dining
hall from the upper lounge,
by the old snack bar en-
trance, have been removed,
so it is advisable not to try
and enter the snack bar by
this route.
