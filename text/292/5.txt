Propaganda versus
History
The theme of this, the fourth series of historical and
documentary films to be shown at Imperial College, has
been chosen to illustrate the conflict that exists in almost any
film dealing with historical events — the conflict between
the historical truth it purports to describe and the motives
and attitudes of the director who makes it.
At first sight it might seem that it is a conflict in which
history is invariably the loser. Every historical or documen-
tary film is propaganda for something; every director im-
poses his own interpretation upon the events he is dealing
with and thereby falsifies them. The cinema, it might be con-
cluded, is of little value in studying history.
This is far from being the case. The historical interest
of a film is in fact greatly increased, because the attitudes of
people towards events are just as much a part of history as
the events themselves. Thus for example the first film in this
series (Lenin — A Biography) provides valuable evidence
not only about Lenin and the Russian Revolution but also
about attitudes in the Soviet Union today.
The films chosen to illustrate the theme of this scries
can be considered in several ways. First, as a documentary
record of such important historical events as the Spanish
Civil War, and the Second World War. In this respect,
Rossif's To Die in Madrid is outstanding. Second, there is the
question of their technical proficiency as propaganda. Carl
Foreman's The Victors, for example, is regarded by some as
the most powerful anti-war film ever made. On some topics
(Apartheid and divided Germany) the films show how identi-
cal or closely related subjects are treated from conflicting
and in some cases unfamiliar viewpoints. Third, there is the
interest of seeing the change in perspective between contem-
porary attitudes to an event and the attitudes of a later
generation. Carl Foreman's attitude to the Second World
War as revealed in The Victors, for instance, is markedly
different from that of people at the time, as can be seen by
contrasting it with the British wartime propaganda films in
the previous programme.
It is both interesting and important to try to understand
and account for these attitudes, why they differ, and why
they change with the passing of time. Hence the value of
propaganda films in the study of history.
