IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 5th OCTOBER, 1970 No. 292
TRIAL STUDENT HOTELc
a ™ « " « wam-Baiiey
SCHEME SUCCESSFUL S n u b s A d m , n
Linstead Hall was opened
as a hotel during the months
of July, August and Sep-
tember to provide lodgings
for students working in Lon-
don, visitors to the college
and young people holiday-
ing in, and passing through,
London. A profit of over
£3,000 was made, which, it
is hoped, will go towards the
cost of converting a new
student house.
The scheme was inaugur-
ated to make use of the
rooms in Hall which would
otherwise stand empty when
not being used for conferen-
ces. Only the 70 rooms on
staircases 2 and 3 in Lin-
stead were used for the trial
scheme, which was run this
year to examine the advan-
tages and disadvantages of
such a project. The basic
idea was to provide accom-
modation for students from
abroad and other British
universities during the peak
summer months when
cheap accommodation is
very difficult to find in Lon-
don.
The original proposal was
put to the welfare commit-
tee by Chris Kent and Jon-
athan Moont, the Halls of
Residence rep. who went on
to produce plans for the
scheme and the way it
should be run. The whole
project was finally appro-
ved, with reservations, by
the Student Residence Com-
mittee.
The staff on the scheme
were all students from I.C.,
working with the co-opera-
tion of Miss Smailes, the
housekeeper, and the per-
manent cleaning staff; Suz-
anne Hardy and Ian Carr
were in charge of reserva-
tions and administration,
Jonathan Moont controlled
the finances, and ten stu-
dent cleaners were working
on a part-time basis.
Over 500 people stayed in
Linstead, with several par-
ties sponsored by interna-
tional student travel organi-
sations housed in Tizard
Hall under the Accommoda-
tion Scheme's management.
Breakfasts were provided by
students during August when
the college refectories were
closed, and students also
stood in as messengers and
security guards at weekends
Mrs. Caroline Ward-
Bailey, who has been em-
ployed by the College in var-
ious posts concerned with
the widening of courses at
I.C., has declined to con-
tinue working for the Col-
lege as aide to the revised
Associated Studies Office.
Caroline was originally
when none were provided by
college security. The scheme
ran without major mishaps
and nearly all available
rooms were o c c u p i e d
throughout the three months;
the major proportion of
guests were foreign students
and foreign university staff
visiting the college.
I.C. students who applied
for residence last term were
housed in Student Houses
and the halls of residence
not in use for conferences.
The rent for staying under
the accommodation scheme
was £6 per week, but it is
possible that next year there
will be lower rates for hol-
ders of International Stu-
dent Identity Cards and
more expensive rates for
non-students.
The main conclusions to
be drawn from the scheme
were that permanent clean-
ing staff should be em-
ployed rather than part-
timers: rooms should only
be let to people unconnec-
ted with University or col-
lege for a maximum of one
week ; non-students should
only be allowed to take
rooms if there are no stu-
dents asking for them.
The continuation and pos-
sible extension of the scheme
next year will depend on the
enthusiasm of more students
to organise and run it, on
the Halls of Residence rep.,
who is yet to be elected,
and, of course, on the con-
tinued approval of the Stu-
dents Residence Committee.
The great demand for rooms
and requests for reservations
for next year has already
shown that all possible
available accommodation is
needed for young people
during the summer.
Mooney
price increases
Paced with a deficit on the running of the Refectories
over the past year of over £28,000, the Refectory Committee
has had no option but to raise all Refectory prices by 15%.
Moreover, the differential between cafeteria and waitress
service meals has been steeply increased, and the upper Din-
ing Hall in the Union has been closed altogether.
The price increase, taking for example a 3/6 meal to
3/11, was decided upon when the loss was believed to be
about £10,000 and was designed to make the refectories
break even next year. However, with the true figures now
known, it appears that it will be some years until the deficit
is paid off.
Falling Customers
At the Refectory Committee meeting, Refectory Manager
Victor Mooney explained how the deficit arose. Firstly, food
prices have gone up by an average of 9% in the past year,
though beef is up by 17%. The Refectory Committee, fol-
lowing its policy of fixed prices throughout the year, has
borne this extra cost without passing it on. Also, the opening
of College Block has added £14.000 to the wages bill, with-
out the increased turnover to compensate. Further contribu-
tory causes are the uneconomic waitress service Dining
Halls, and a falling number of customers. The latter is par-
tially due to the successful boycott of Southside Lower Re-
fectory (now closed) following the cockroach incidents re-
ported in Felix 284 last January. The boycott is estimated
to have caused £2.000 to £3,000 loss to the Refectories.
Upper Union Closed
The Committee also decided to close entirely the waitress
service in the Union upper Dining Hall, although it will still
be bookable for formal evening dinners. The waitress services
have been under-used and this is bound to get worse after
the recent price increases. Faced with a choice between
closing the Union Dining Hall or the Southside Staff Dining
Hall, it was more economic to close the former. This is be-
cause the Union Dining Hall has its own separate kitchen, re-
quiring additional staff, whereas all Southside refectories
will be served by the one kitchen.
The closure of the Union waitress service has brought pro-
tests from club officials who have to entertain guest speakers
etc., to lunoh. This problem also applies to Technicians and
other College employees. Therefore the Refectory Commit-
tee and I.C. Union are recommending to the Senior Common
Room Committee that the Staff Dining Room in South-
side should be opened to all. This would not cause great an-
noyance to the staff, as the price would normally deter stu-
dents from eating there.
In the meantime, students faced with the problem of
where to take guests to lunch are advised to find a member
of staff to sponsor them as guests in the Staff Refectories.
Moreover, if a member of staff cannot be found, Domestic
Bursar Carl Seaford has offered to sponsor any bona-fide
student officials, if they contact him in advance via his of-
fice.
dismissed when the College
decided to run down Assoc-
iated Studies last June. Un-
der pressure, however, the
College reversed its decision
and decided to offer Mrs.
Ward-Bailey a clerical post.
In a calculated (and well-
deserved) snub to the Col-
lege, she has turned down
this offer.
The interest in course
broadening at I.C. was lar-
gely fostered by the late
Pro-Rector, Lord Willis
Jackson, to whom Caroline
Ward-Bailey was research
Assistant. Until his un-
timely death last year, Lord
Jackson's stature and influ-
ence ensured the progress,
albeit slow, towards greater
diversification, despite the
fact that the majority of
Professors here prefer the
old-fashioned narrow-min-
ded Degree Factory treat-
ment.
After Lord Jackson's de-
mise, the reactionary ele-
ments in the College lost no
time in gathering forces and
started to run down the
Associated Studies Office.
Mrs. Ward-Bailey was dis-
missed on the grounds that
there was no structure for
her to fit in!
This backwards trend
brought an immediate out-
cry from students and some
staff, and under strong pres-
sure from I.C. Union and
the Assoc. Studies Commit-
tee, the College was forced
to back down.
However, Mrs. Ward-
Bailey was only offered a
post as a Senior Clerk, and
she felt that this did not
give the job the status it
needed or deserved. Inter-
nal status politics prevented
the post being up-graded to
an administrative scale. Fur-
thermore, it was obvious
that the College had only
backed down under pres-
sure, and that the reaction-
aries would try and force
closure of her proposed
office as soon as they
thought they could get away
with it. Therefore Caroline
thought that she could not
accept the post, and will in-
stead seek a job with less
in-fighting and a more secure
future.
The hounded Associated
Studies Committee has now
to find someone as capable
and as determined as Caro-
line, to carry on this impor-
tant work. The Union has
requested, and been offered,
representation on the selec-
tion panel for Mrs. Ward-
Bailey's successor.
