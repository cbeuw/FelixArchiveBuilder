Sir Barnes Wallis with his latest brainchild — the Swallow
The Misconducting
Apprentice
This short article concerns the trials and tribulations of
an engineering apprentice. It may be of some importance to
engineering students at I.C. who are financed by outside
firms.
His case was heard in the Court of Appeal on 28th April,
1970.
A n apprentice named Dunk was apprenticed in Decem-
ber. 1964, for four years to an engineering firm. The Agree-
ment which Dunk had with the firm included a clause entit-
ling his employers to terminate the Agreement if the appren-
tice was guilty of mis-conduct. Dunk attended the local
technical college, he passed his first examination on the
second attempt, but reports on his prospect of passing the
second examination were unfavourable. The employers on
receiving the college report terminated Dunk's apprentice-
ship. Dunk took his case to the High Court which awarded
him only £2 nominal damages. He appealed to the Court
of Appeal which ruled that the employers had no right to
terminate the Agreement since Dunk had not been guilty of
misconduct — in that his apparent failure to reach the
required standard in his academic studies was not tanta-
mount to misconduct. The Court of Appeal awarded dam-
ages to Dunk.

Sir Barnes Wallis
new President of
Wells Soc
Last year 1,050 IC stud-
ents turned on at least once,
to the Wellsoc scene; so
much so that Monday night
happenings transcended into
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
Thursdays . . . so that al-
most every night is Wellsoc
night.
O.K. — for the uninitiated
what is this Wellsoc scene?
It is according to Somerset
House and the SCC standing
orders, the H . G. Wells
Society of Imperial College,
born in 1963, the brainchild
of M r . Sinclair Goodlad et
al. (the same al who has co-
authored many scientific
papers on diverse subjects.)
In spite of its name the
Society has no connection
with the life and times of
H . G. Wells but his aims
and objectives coincided
most nearly with our own
so the Society adopted Wells
as their "Patron Saint".
The original slogan Mon-
day Night is Wellsoc Night,
has become rather dated
since the society's activities
have expanded, however the
accent is still on the Mon-
day evening lectures. When
throughout the winter and
spring terms a prominent
visiting lecturer gives a talk
on some aspect in his field
of work. These guests bring
along films and many pecu-
liar props for demonstrations
in the case of such sub-
jects as hypnotism, LSD,
topology, linear motors and
explosions. Needless to say
some of these demonstrations
have been very spectacular
and have literally brought
the house down, nearly!
After lecture we invite mem-
bers to coffee to discuss
aspects of their subject in
a more relaxed atmosphere
over coffee.
Within the framework of
the Society's aims study
groups have been set up to
examine UFO's, Ghosts,
ESP and related phenomena
on the fringe of science fic-
tion into the science fact of
pollution and technological
forecasting. Topical exhibi-
tions on these subjects have
been staged during the spring
term. Inevitably activities in
the groups field have been
directed where the members'
interest lies and as trends of
thought change so must the
subjects of study. A wind of
change is at present blow-
ing through Wellsoc and
there is a "re-think" in pro-
gress on the groups scene.
To alleviate the academic
indigestion (how's that for
an anti-peristaltic phrase?)
Wellsoc won fame and
favour for initiating a Tom
and Jerry cult and as an
aside some large cinema-
scope feature films, screened
on Southside sheets. This
year there will be an even
larger film programme, in-
corporating sex, cartoons,
sex, horror, corn and sex.
The Society's new presi-
dent, Sir Barnes, C B E , FRS,
will open the Session's pro-
gramme with his inaugural
lecture on the theme of
transport in the future.
Many members of the col-
lege will recall Sir Barnes'
lecture on the Strength of
England, which two years
ago smashed the attendance
records of the society.
Sir Barnes, who at the
remarkable age of 83, still
works full time at BAC's
Aeronautical Research De-
partment, has in his life de-
signed airships — the R100,
special bombs which were
used successfully on the
famous R A F Dambuster
Missions and were respon-
sible for the sinking of the
Tirpitz. He is at present en-
gaged in the development of
variable geometry (swing
wing) aircraft. With Sir
Barnes' presidential lecture,
a new precedent will be
established by using the
Great Hall in the College
Block for the first time.
If you have not already
joined Wellsoc, you can
join at any of the meetings
or by filling in the form be-
low. Y o u will be receiving
details of this year's pro-
gramme shortly.
I wish to become a member of Wellsoc.
