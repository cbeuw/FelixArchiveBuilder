As you no doubt know by now, I.C. is
composed of three smaller colleges and Imperial
College is these three stuck together.
Soss Roberts discusses the
Constituent College
Unions
However, it isn't just as
simple as that, because there
are thus four colleges and
hence four students' unions.
The Presidents of the three
constituent college unions
(CCU's) are automatically
tangled up into the workings
of the all-embracing Im-
perial College Union (ICU).
Each of the four Unions has
its separate meetings and
every student at IC is elig-
ible to go to two of them:
ICU, and his particular
CCU. Since ICU, to the pub-
lic at large, is more impor-
tant than any particular
CCU, most serious Union
matters are discussed at I C U
meetings and the lighter stuff
and sports are left to the
CCU's. Many people at IC,
especially the Lefties, are
against the very existence of
the CCU's on the grounds
that four Unions cause four
times as much chaos and re-
quire four times as many
places in Hall, than one
union; and the CCU's en-
courage and propagate the
decadent Rugby Club/Union
Bar / Piss-Artist / Fascist
clique. On the other hand
many other people, especially
members of this latter clique
(i.e. anybody not a Leftie)
are all for CCU's on the
grounds that some difference
is necessary for sporting and
social purposes.
D I F F E R E N C E S
To enable you to recog-
nise your own C C U if you
stumble across it accidentally
the basic differences between
the three CCU's are as fol-
lows. R C S U is composed of
pure scientists, C & G U of
engineers, and R S M U of
mining and metallurgy stu-
dents. The student popula-
tions are respectively about
1700, 1700, and 500, and
since each Union receives
about the same grant from
the Powers that Be, it is
obvious that R S M U spends
a lot more money per capita
than the other two CCU's. It
so happens that all Miners
are the same sort of people
— they play rugby, swim in
beer, and don't like Lefties,
and are therefore members
of the R C / U B / P A / F clique.
In fact, informed sources
assert that this clique is
really R S M U in disguise,
and vice versa. You only
have to go to an R S M U
meeting to see for yourself
(but don't get recognised if
you're not a member of
RSMU); and because of this
homogeneity R S M U is a
very strong Union — much
more so than R C S U and
C & G U . Often it appears
that the whole C C U system
is being held up by RSMU's
stability.
The other two Unions have
a fair proportion of sport-
ing members but quite a few
Lefties as well — but since
Lefties don't believe in
CCU's we can forget about
them for the purposes of this
discussion. In spite of their
greater size R C S U and
C & G U are very apathetic
— about as bad as I C U it-
self, which at times seems
the very paragon of apathy.
In sport R C S U and C & G U
are about equal. But what
makes R C S U better than
C & G U (and what makes
it obvious who is writing
this) is that each C C U pro-
duces a Broadsheet, and
Guilds' Sheet is a rather
sorry - looking publication,
owing to general apathy and
hence lack of contributors.
The R C S Broadsheet is very
popular within R C S and is
run by a few hard-working
people; the Mines News-
letter is very good and is
run by more hard-working
people. These sheets are the
equivalent of Felix on a
C C U scale, but are N O T in-
tended to oust Felix, which
is the paper of I C U and
hence more necessary than
C C U sheets; rather do they
attempt to keep O C U mem-
bers in touch with their
Union. They only exist be-
cause they are popular, and
most serious IC news
appears in Felix.
In order to distinguish
themselves audibly on occa-
sions when rival colleges
meet, each C C U has a chant
which will be taught to
freshers at the Freshers
Union Meetings on Tuesday
at 1.15. RCS chant a Swahili
obscenity which begins Kan-
gela Armedola (need I say
more?), Guilds have the
Boomalaka, and all Mines
can manage is a bellowed
"M-I-N-E-S" (but then it
depends on how loud they
bellow it). To distinguish
themselves visibly each C C U
has a mascot — R C S have
Theta, at present of un-
known whereabouts, C & G
Spanner, and R S M Davy
Lamp. There are also invio-
late mascots, consisting of
vintage motor vehicles: Jeze-
bel, Boanerges and Clemen-
tine respectively.
Obviously as a member of
only one C C U I'm biased.
You can see for yourself
what your C C U is like; each
C C U is meeting at 1.15 to-
morrow and I C U meets on
Thursday at 1.15.
There are some good
heavy politics at I C U and
much lighter stuff at C C U
Register
your
vote
Under a recent Court of
Appeal ruling, on a test case
in May financed by NUS,
students can now register to
vote in their College consti-
tuencies.
The Court ruled that stu-
dents in Hall, lodgings, or
flats could be regarded as
residents in that constituen-
cy, as well as in their home
constituency. But they must
register whilst at College,
and the registration formali-
ties take place this month.
A student, incidentally, is en-
titled to vote if he will be
18 by 15th February.
ICU President Judith
Walker is distributing pub-
licity in an attempt to inform
students of these recent
changes in the law. It is im-
portant, also, that landladies
are informed at once, as the
registration forms are filled
in by them.
The court also laid down
that a person may be "resi-
dent" at more than one
place, so students should
still be registered at their
home address by their par-
ents.
When a person is resident
in two places, then he may
vote in B O T H places for
local elections and parlia-
mentary by-elections, pro-
vided the two places are in
different local authorities or
constituencies.
However, he may only
vote O N C E in a General
Election and stiff penalties
await those who do vote
twice.
Students are also entitled
to postal votes, and should
apply to the Electoral Regis-
tration Officer for form Q,
without delay.
The local IC constituency
is the Cities of London and
Westminster. At the last elec-
tion, the candidate who won
by a huge majority was —
would you believe it — the
Tory.

meetings, so go along and
support them. If you really
can't make it then the meet-
ings are reported in Felix
and the Broadsheets. Have
fun.
I.G. Optical Systems Ltd.
The Governors of Im-
perial College have approved
a proposal to establish a
small company within the
College called "IC Optical
Systems Ltd". The main ob-
jective is to make highly
specialized optical instru-
ments and components, re-
quiring the investigation of
new methods of design,
manufacture, mounting and
testing.
The capital will be sub-
scribed jointly by the Col-
lege, Technical Development
Capital Ltd. (TDC) and
members of staff in the
Applied Optics and other
research sections of the De-
partment of Physics, namely:
Professor C. G. Wynne,
FRS, Optical design; Profes-
sor W. R. S. Garton, FRS,
Spectroscopy; Professor J.
Ring, Infrared Astronomy;
Dr. W. T. Welford, Applied
Optics; Mr. H . W. Yates,
Mr. C. Pataky, Optical
manufacturing specialists.
The work undertaken will
be mainly 'one-off' lenses
and components for bubble
;hambers, telescopes and
pedographs, and other
pecialised precision devices
i most cases needed for re-
earch projects.
There is no intention that
he Company should engage
in large-scale manufacture
at the College. The Com-
pany will make full and
proper payment for any use
it makes of College tools,
equipment and space.
The existence of this acti-
vity in the College will result
in improved facilities for
postgraduate teaching, an
increase in the scope of re-
search, the proving of designs
by members of the staff and
the training of glass-working
technicians to the high stan-
dards and in the techniques
required for this specialized
work.

The new Pro-Rector,
New
Species
in
College
Block
The editor's attention was
recently drawn to a little
known qualification which
may be gained at this re-
nowned seat of learning. If
the reader would observe the
new version of the College
Registration warning notices
around the place, he will see
that it refers to a form of
life which it calls under-
gaduates (sic). It would
thus appear that college
bureaucracy has involved it-
self with that previously in-
violable aspect of student
life — gadding about.
This, we feel, cannot be a
mistake on the part of A d -
min. Far be it from F E L I X
to suggest that the College
Block Clique would employ
anyone who cannot spell or
proof-read, and we, being
rather better acquainted with
the illustrious members of
SOGAT than most, cannot
lay the blame on any hypo-
thetical pissed printer at the
Purley Press.
So, freshmen and un-
informed sophomores, be
warned, Uncle Bill has de-
creed, "Verily, thou shalt
not gad until thou hast
gaduated."
Today's generation lay it on the line!
You think 'blowing your
cool' is fusing the fridge?
You need
getting straight!
You think grass is the green You think Simon and Garfunkel
stuff they play football on? are a firm of solicitors?
