EUROPE
LIFT A
ON A
DAY
The idea was to get to
Stockholm on as little money
as possible, but when we had
been standing by the road-
side at Ostend for an hour
or so, we began to have
doubts. Happily thumbing at
dour businessmen driving by,
we were hailed by two more
hitchhikers heading back
into town for food.
"How many days have you
been here?", one asked.
"Oh, only about half an
hour", we lied cheerfully.
"We've been here since
5 this morning", he said,
equally cheerfully. It was late
afternoon.
"Oh", we said.
We were finally picked up
by a German soldier who
spoke not a word of English,
but took us through Belgium
to Aachen in Germany,
where we made it to the
Youth Hostel with the aid
of Barry, whom we met re-
treating from the Autobahn,
unsuccessfully. We just
wanted a roof over our
heads; Barry wanted a shit,
a shower, a shag and a shave
in that order, and guided us
to a hostel full of English
hitchhikers.
After 4 lifts the next day
we were in Essen-Werden in
the Ruhr valley, which was
the first example of good
scenery we had come across
on the continent. The youth
hostel was marred by the
food: cold meat and bread,
which had the flavour and
texture of cork table mats,
and tea made from the local
vegetation, but we learned
to accept, if not eat, this dur-
ing our travels in Germany.
The mental home which was
holidaying at the hostel
tended to unnerve us at first,
but when we had fled some
of the friendlier inhabitants
we found the only other sane
person there, who didn't
speak English. We conversed
in broken French and shat-
tered German, and she
taught us to ask drivers
where they were going in-
stead of whether they were
feeling OK.
We spent the next night in
a hostel full of schoolkids
on holiday from Bremen. At
eleven at night Roger went
up to see if they were dis-
mantling the hostel around
us, and met their English
teacher, who offered us a
lift to the Autobahn in the
morning if we sat in on one
of his lessons for half an
hour.
Showing kids how to
mumble with a Geordie
accent was more interesting
than standing in the rain
at the Autobahn entrance
with another guy who said
he had been there 2 days;
after 2 hours we believed
him and started walking.
After much village-hopping
and route - changing we
reached the Y H at Ham-
burg which was staffed with
refugees from the 3rd Reich,
Students!
\$eVe got plans
Students of London,
Lloyds Bank has plans to keep
you on the rightcourse while you're
at college. We're giving away large-
scale, detailed street maps of
London to all students who open
a bank account with us.
These street maps have places
of interest and Lloyds Bank
branches clearly marked, as well as
a comprehensive street index. The
maps are free of charge.
So are the bank accounts.
Lloyds Bank makes no charge
for running a student's current
account, provided it is kept in credit.
So go to your nearest Lloyds
branch, open a bank account and
get your map. Then you'll be sure
you're always heading in the right
direction. Financially as
well as geographically.

Nearest branch to the College: 67/69 Old Brompton Road, S.W.9
and went out to sample the
night life. We can verify that
Hamburg is indeed disgust-
ing and degenerate, so its
worth stopping off there for
a night if you're in the area.
We reached Denmark and
rediscovered the miracle of
hot, cooked food. After hear-
ing tales of the friendliness
of Danish drivers to English
hitchhikers, we were brought
down when we had spent 3
or 4 hours in rain and sun-
shine watching the friendly
Danes wave and smile jov-
ially at us as they zoomed
by. Then our luck changed
and we went from the Ger-
man border to the centre of
Copenhagen in 2 lifts and
less than five hours. Copen-
hagen youth hostel was, of
course, full.
We moved on to Elsinore
the next morning, and left
our gear there while we took
the ferry to Sweden. It was
already apparent that we
had neither the time nor
money to reach Stockholm,
so contented ourselves with
reaching Sweden, which was
expensive and wet and
started to come home. Two
days and ten lifts later we
were at Esbjerg. On the way
we met up at Kolding with
two students we had met in
Hamburg. They had spent
the intervening period pick-
ing up Danish porn to take
home and flog in sunny
Newcastle. A search to find
the night life in Kolding re-
vealed that there weren't
none, only the young
sitting in the market square
smoking hash.
At Esbjerg we found next
day's boat booked up, so
we left that evening and
sailed home with some Dan-
ish schoolchildren, who were
old enough to be company
and wild enough to be fun.
KENSINGTON UNIVERSITY ?
continued from back page
the latter of whom presented his case for South Kensington
Tech. last term. Opposing them were Professors Ball, Coles.
Southwood, Skempton and others.
It was pointed out that independence is not solely an 1C
decision. Would the University Grants Committee support
it? The Commission on Medical Education has yet to report,
and it may suggest joining IC and the Postgraduate Medical
School at Hammersmith. Moreover, the Tory government's
inquiry into Teacher Education may recommend closer links
between Colleges of Education and Universities, i.e. it de-
pends on whether the present binary system is to continue.
Most members of the BoSt favoured decentralisation of
UL, while retaining links. Regional groupings of the Colleges
would not be favoured by the smaller members of UL, as
they would be in danger of being swamped by the big boys.
Basically, the advantages of retaining links with U L are
as follows. It enables joint degrees, where the student's
choice is not bound up in one College. There are the advan-
tages of Central facilities, such as computers, audio-visual
centre. U L also finances central institutions, such as the
Courtaulds Institute. Diversification could be facilitated by
using the departments of other U L Colleges — not possible
if IC is a separate University. U L Colleges also collaborate
on research projects, and students collaborate via U L U and
its clubs.
It was pointed out that IC already has an independence
not enjoyed by the other schools of U L — Lord Penney
is on the Committee of Vice-Chancellors, and IC gets a
direct grant from the UGC. Moreover, is was claimed that
the secessionist league was based mainly on ideas of prestige
— i.e. making IC alone into a University of Technology.
From the arguments it appears that the main disadvan-
tages of U L are the cumbersome regulations and liberal
availability of red tape. This tends to delay acceptance of
new methods of examination or new courses, and generally
acts as a dampener of fresh ideas.
Lord Penney pointed out that we cannot just submit that
we want to secede — we must also give details of the pro-
posed future of an independent IC. He felt that there is
too wide a split — as many want to leave as stay in, and
no agreement has been reached on what to put in its place.
As far as IC Union is concerned, USK figures large in
ICU policy as an informal link between colleges, but it is
a cross binary group containing Colleges of Education, Uni-
versity College, and Technical Colleges. As such, USK is
an ideal until a government decision is made on a scheme
for comprehensive Higher Education.
The alternatives appear to be as below:—
IC as a University of Technology, with a battle starting
anew for diversification.
Or a higher class Tech., at a time when the role of the
existing technical colleges is in question.
I.C. Success at World
Gliding Championships
Mr. George Burton, ex-
student member of Imperial
College Gliding Club, was
placed fourth in the World
Gliding Championships held
this summer at Marfa,
Texas. He was the highest
placed of the four British
Team members, a position
which he held in the last
World Championships in
1968, when he came seventh.
There are two classes in the
Championships: Standard
Class, where the span is
limited to 15 metres and
other restrictions apply, and
the Open Class which is
totally unrestricted. Mr.
Burton was competing in the
Open Class, and flying a
Glasfliigel Kestrel 19. This
glassfibre sailplane is a 19
metre wingspan version of
the 17 metre production
model, and was specially
modified for Mr. Burton by
Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd., of
Kirkbymoorside, Yorkshire.
This has been a particu-
larly successful year for Mr.
Burton. For the third suc-
cessive year he collected the
Frank Foster Trophy,
awarded for the fastest flight
round a 100 km. triangle in
Great Britain, with a speed
of 74.4 k.p.h. Just before
the Championships he was
appointed managing director
of Slingsby's, when the firm
was taken over by Vickers,
and on his return from
Texas he came second in
the British Open Class
National Championships.
