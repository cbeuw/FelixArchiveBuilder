COLCUTT
The Hard Life
The purple dots marched across the room, wheeled and
formed fours with the red diamonds coming through my
head. I screwed my eyes shut to make them come to atten-
tion but the cacophony of the quarter peal from the belfry
sent them dancing into the sunlight coming through the open
window. The quarter peal faded into the monotonous clang
of the tenor bell and I realised there was someone at the
door. I poked the wife and crawled over her to find my
clothes under the chair. The taste of nicotine whisky was
sour on my tongue but the bottle of Black Label was dead
on the floor.
"It's a hard life" I said to the pigeon who was wonder-
ing whether the squashed pink cherries on the woman's
breasts were edible, found one sock in the piss-pot, pulled my
shoes on and fell barefoot down the stairs. The door swung
open with the second try and I coughed as the evening air
mixed with the smoke in my lungs.
The two mobbers came at me from either side and had
me in the Rover before I could roll the phlegm round my
mouth once. Big P. looked at me and said that any two bit
journalist who tried writing him down would end up on the
firstflightto Amman. I stopped my hands shaking and tried
to convince myself it was the D.T.'s again. Big P. looked at
his watch, said "seven-thirty, time for bed" and I bounced
onto the pavement outside the Union Office.
"Colcutt" I hissed at Needham, who pulled his thumb
out of his mouth and asked me how to spell secretary. I
sneered and went into the inner sanctum. Baby Jude was
pointing her breasts at nothing in particular, otherwise known
as the Deputy President. She swung her legs from under the
desk and ripped her tights on the chair.
"It's a hard life" I murmured as I sat down.
"What are you going to do about it? " said Kirkham,
hauling himself out of his pint pot and shoving his gut in my
face. But I'd done it already so they opened a window and I
crawled off to see my editor.
He was slumped on the floor of the Press Room, wrap-
ped round a bottle of malt and groaning "Press date to-
morrow and only two pages of ads. at the printers". The
wispy blonde with the tight breasts bounced through the door
and dragged him across the landing.
"Christ, four times in three hours, what a hard life," he
screamed across his shoulders. I was getting sick of this joke
but lifted the bottle of malt and reflected that one person
keeping his end up was enough.
I lurched back to the Queens Tower. Designed and built
it myself way back but the neighbourhood was going to ruin
with all the students around. The pigeon had gone away
hungry and the wife was still senseless.
The typewriter was still in the corner where I'd left it
four months ago and I dragged it out and settled down to
write the first scathing column of the session. The letters on
the typewriter blurred and my mind went black.
Two hours later, as I was half way through my first
sentence, her white arms folded round my neck and pulled
me back between her breasts. The cherry crop suddenly
looked good this year. I broke open a new pack of Players
and reached for the malt. The red diamonds swirled back in
through the window. The smoke burned my mouth and the
malt made my gut ache.
Suddenly I felt good again.

S o u t h s i d e
Mr. Frank Potter has been

Tony Sims (above) will be
the dynamic, bursting with
energy editor of FELIX this

but anyone with the slightest
aspirations to literary merit,
or can type, take photos or
is just a normal congenital
idiot may find their niche
working for FELIX. Come
along to the Press Room
(top floor, Union Building)
any Tuesday or Thursday
dinner time and find out for
yourself.
To enable our readers
to find their way about
all the numerous refec-
tories in the College,
our intrepid Felix re-
porter Tony Kirkham
was sent on an expedi-
tion to the furthermost
outposts of Mooney,
and reports below on
what he found there.
In SOUTHSIDE, the main
refectory is the new cafe-
teria, described on the back
page. This is intended to
satisfy the need for cheaper
meals, and better sandwich
and salad services. This
cafeteria is the only one open
at weekends, and is open
during the following hours:
Breakfast: 08.30 to 09.30
Lunch: 12.00 to 14.00
Supper: 17.00 to 19.00
At the East end of South-
side is the Staff Dining
Room, where you can get a
waitress-served meal for
about 7/-. The dining hall
has pleasant modern decor,
with octagonal tables, and is
open at lunchtime on week-
days. Although it is not yet
open to students, negotia-
tions are under way to allow
anyone in. Also for staff is
the Staff Buttery service in
the SCR bar at lunchtime.
In the evening during the
week, there will be an a la
carte waitress service operat-
ing in a screened-off corner
of the new cafeteria. The
food here will be the same
standard as the old South-
side evening waitress service,
and you won't get away with
a meal under about 9/-.
Across Prince Consort
Road, in the UNION, the
ground floor cafeteria will
continue to operate as in pre-
vious years, serving break-
fasts from 8.30 to 9.30 and
cafeteria meals from 12.00
to 14.00 and from 17.00 to
19.00. However, it will no
longer be open on Saturday
morning. Average price is
about 4/6 to 5/-, except for
the newly-introduced "cheap
daily" at 2/6 to 3/-. Although
the furniture is rather older
than in College Block, the
queues are invariably shor-
ter.
In between the Union and
Southside lies COLLEGE
BLOCK, which, due to its
central position, tends to
breed long queues. A l l the
facilities in College Block
open during lunchtime only,
i.e. noon until 2.00 p.m. The
Student Buttery on level two
has proved very popular, in
fact too popular. The cause
of the huge queues found
there last year was that the
pie and chips at about 3/-
represented the best value
Exposed
for money in the College.
Thus 600 to 700 meals were
served in a buttery seating
90. The opening of the new
Southside multi-access refec-
tory should help ease the
waiting time.
On the ground floor of the
building is the College Block
Cafeteria, the largest refec-
tory in IC. It is similar to
the Union in its services, but
only opens at lunchtime.
The decor is modern, the
food the best of all the cafe-
terias, but the queues very
long. Average price is 5/-,
except the "Cheap daily".
One corner of the refectory
is roped off to isolate the
waitress service, where you
get the same food as in the
cafeteria, but have to pay
about 2/- more for the wait-
resses.
Also in College Block,
though not for students, are
the Staff Buttery, next door
to the Student Buttery, and
the Staff Dining Room,
which serves high class meals
to members of the Senior
Academic Staff.
Your intrepid Felix repor-
ter also just managed to find
his way to the three bars in
IC. These are Southside bar,
through the T V room on
the ground floor; the Union
bar on the ground floor of
the Union building; and
College block bar tagged on
to one corner of the Junior
Common Room on level 2
College Block. The Union
bar still clings to its men
only rule. College Block bar
only opens at lunch-time.
The bar hours are: 12.30 to
14.00 and 18.00 to 23.00 dur-
ing the week. On Sunday,
only Southside bar opens,
and its evening opening
hours are 19.00 to 22.00.
