Porcelain Loot
Although ostensibly telling the story
behind a murder in a public toilet,
this is, in fact, an involving play
about alienation, prejudice,
homophobia and racism. Through
the voices of five actors the
audience is given a tour of the
emotional torment of a young, gay,
Chinese man, John Lee, desperate
to belong, desperate to be loved.
We are given a taste of the isolation
he feels, both as an Oriental in a
western country, and as a
homosexual in an often homophobic
society.
The compact theatre, with the
actors and the small audience a
mere metre or so apart, adds to the
intimacy and immediacy of the
piece, and is a vital component of
the acting—the facial expressions of
each actor are integral to their
performance. Though one might
have doubts about the maturity
exhibited by John Lee, supposedly
nineteen years old, the
performances are on the whole quite
convincing. The dissolute
psychologist, the opinionated
reporter, the casually brutal lover.
The graphic (and sometimes
explicit) language used creates vivid
scenes, and involves the listener
closely. The overall message of the
play is that everyone is basically
similar, be they straight, gay, white
or yellow, with cultural differences
as barriers to understanding which
communication can overcome.
The programme is an interesting
piece of art in itself—try out the
origami!

Armed and Dangerous
'The Media is the modern-day
mirror to our souls, and as it stands
to date, the black community
through the eyes of the media is
soulless. Our coming together as the
Posse is the first stop on the journey
to our (souls') true self. That's how
eight talented black actors got
together and set up their own
production company.
Armed and Dangerous is a
collection of sketches which have
been written by the Posse, a mixture
of comedy and music depicting
experiences and stereotypes of
being black in Britain.
Most of the sketches are
brilliantly done and hilarious. The
music is also very well chosen and
becomes an integral part of the play.
A blind runner unexpectedly shows
up and connects totally unrelated
scenes. There is obviously a
reference to the Los Angeles riots,
,a homosexual version of Romeo
and Juliet (Romeo and Julian) and
a broken-hearted painter-poet. One
of the funniest sketches is the
'black' version of the fairytale of
the 'Three Bears'.
On top of everything else a
warm, lively, participating audience
gave the theatre a unique
atmosphere.
Highly recommended!

12th-31st May, Tuesday, Sunday,
8pm. Tickets £ 3 — £ 1 2 , £ 2

Confronted by a stage displaying a
large five pound note featuring the
Virgin Mary and Jesus, a few
wreaths and some rather naff organ
music, one wonders quite what is
going to happen next. A loud burst
of sex pistols introduces the play
and sets the tone for things to come.
The stage is dominated by a coffin
and religious portraits, emphasizing
the presence of Catholicism.
The story centres around Mrs.
McLeary's 'natural' death and a
bank robbery. McLeary's son Hal,
and the undertaker are the culprits
of the crime and detective Truscott
is trying to solve the case. Truscott,
posing as a water board official,
shows a distinct lack of respect for
law and order, as do most of the
characters.
Loot is a clever farce, although
there is a tendency to veer toward
complete ludicrousness. David
Troughton's performance as
Truscott was particularly amusing
and is a display of Orton's
convincing parody.
Joe Orton was a playwright in
obscurity until both he and his
lover, Kenneth Halliwell, were
jailed. After this six month sentence
Orton's writing changed by
becoming more detached, leading to
success. 'Loot' was written in 1964
in this successful period of his life.
In August 1967 Joe Orton was
beaten to death with a hammer by
Halliwell who was jealous of his
success. Halliwell later committed
suicide.
The play challenges traditional
views on death, religion and justice.
Thought provoking? Maybe.
