-Wild America -Industrial Sound and Magic
Wild America?.. .sounded more like
puerile America to us!
You know, all we needed was
another wannabe Axl Rose (and
lead singer Anthony Corder has
succeeded better than most), yet
they're from Memphis, not L A .
Shock, horror!!
Basically, this album is yet
another trashy piece of so-called
'rock', but if you do like 'bands'
like Guns 'n' Poser's or LA Guns
you might like them (don't know
how...personally we were almost
driven insane listening to it until we
indulged in our favourite
pastime...).
So for all of you in RockSoc (if
you're reading this) here's a new
album for you—as for the rest of
you, don't bother, it's crap.
Bov & GBFH.
• 'Wild America' is out now on
A & M .
Rev Hammer...not a name which
conjures up an accurate mental
image of the band. It makes them
sound like rap band although their
most obvious influence is The
Levellers who play on this album.
(If you don't catch it in the music,
the fact that most of their surnames
are Leveller might just give it away.
Their music's catchy but it doesn't
strike you make you jump around
the room like The Levellers. Maybe
that's a little unfair because The
Levellers are so good, and as yet
they can only aspire, but they do
have time to mature.
If you're not familiar with The
Levellers, Rev Hammer use a rich
blend of 'traditional folk' music
with a modern twist to carry their
ideas to the public.
All in all Rev Hammer are good,
but not (yet) capable of grasping
major acclaim. My advice—buy it
Popinjays -
Monstermouth
The Popinjays return with two new
members, and an superb new
powerpop single. It bounces onto
the record deck, spins itself around
like a dizzy dream, and sneaks into
your subconscious after only two
listens, so you can't stop singing it
all day. Bright and cheery, just what
we need for a lovely summer's day
annoying the neighbours with loud
music and smokey barbecues, with
the mosquitoes buzzing around,
biting you, and wasps and sunburn
and skin cancer. Don't you just love
the summer.

• 'Monstermouth' is out now on
One Little Indian. The Popinjays
play at Camden Palace next month.
Hie Popinjays: Bang, there she was.
and widen your horizons.

• 'Industrial Sound and Magic' is
out on Tuesday through Cooking
Vinyl. Rev Hammer play the
Hackney Empire tonight, £7/£6
Chocolate
Minogue
Tonight sees the return of My Life
Story, of whom the best description
I've heard is 'Orchestral Smiths'
(apart from the obvious 'the best
unsigned band on the planet', of
course), together with Irish rock
band Power Of Dreams. If you
were feeling excessively rich, you
could go and see My Life Story,
and then head off elsewhere, either
to see the only band better than
Abba, Bjom Again, or Carter's first
major London show without the
Beast.
Carter and Bjorn Again are back
on Saturday, the former being
supported by the second most loony
band in Cork, The Frank &
Walters. Orange and purple clothes
only. Elsewhere, for those of you
feeling like a more serious feel than
those nutters, Pele, and elsewhere,
Boo Hewerdine, who can play a
stunning acoustic set, Because, and
Scarlet. A great evening for those
of you into a acoustic style evening
with a fine line in lyrics.
Bank Holiday Monday, and all
we can manage is Nutmeg. Just as
well it's cheap, what with the banks
being closed and everything.
Tuesday, and Fabulous are back
after their Carter support, at the
Palace, Limahl (I ask you! Some
people just refuse to die quietly),
and Frank Sinatra, at the Albert
Hall. You have been warned.
Wednesday is national Irish band
day, so to celebrate, we have This
Picture, and Kirsty MacColl with
Forget-Me-Nots, and to round off
the week, The Family Cat, who
immediately after playing here,
realised they were crap and set
about writing some good songs,
The Rockingbirds, and Pele again!
They must be promoting
something. Probably their new
single. That's it for another week
