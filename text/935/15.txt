Music Felix 935 22 May 1992
Bedazzled: featuring Laurence Carrington-Windo
(made-up name), middle right.
Eat
-Golden Egg
Eat up your greens or you '11 end
up looking like this weirdo.
The last time Felix encountered Eat,
they split up. We interviewed them
(issue 882, 8 November 1990), they
realised they'd reached the highest
possible level in the music world,
so they quit at the top. The last line
of the interview: 'Sometimes I wish
I was working in Dixons'.
And now they're back, after
supporting The Wonderstuff at
Brixton in December.
And a great tune, it is too, with
its 'Shut up, I'll do what I wanna
do' refrain, and it's of a musical
genre known as 'Swampadelica'. I
know, 'cause it says so here. So
that's all we need to know really,
isn't it? It's Swampadelic. It's about
telling people to stuff it where the
sun don't shine. And it's great.

• 'Golden Egg' is out on
Monday. Eat play Town & Country
Club, June 13.
Bedazzled
-ULU
now clear to me. ULU's main hall
was like daylight, virtually blinding
in some songs. The band run
through their nine song set, like a
cross between Scorpio Rising and
Blur, like Thousand Yard Stare on
acid, and the lead singer proceeds
to attempt to digest the mic-stand
during one song. Such agood band
should not be subjected to
supporting Airhead in front of
fourteen year old girls. When the
said fourteen year olds started to
drift back into the arena from the
bar, I took it as a sign that Airhead
were about to appear, so, with all
haste, I left.

•Bedazzled supported Airhead on
Tuesday. They release a new
single, 'Summersong', in June on
Columbia.
The
Adventures
-Powerhaus
I haven't had an adrenalin rush like
this for ages. The support bands
were bearable, but I chose to ignore
them. And then The Adventures
launch into a new song. The
apparent deficiency of Eileen
Gribben is soon rectified when she
climbs onto the stage after this first
song. 'Play us an old one' shout the
crowd. And they do. 1984's 'Send
My Heart', segued onto 'Feel The
Raindrops', and I begin to wonder
why this band have only had one top
40 hit in the past eight years.
(Answers on a postcard please).
The band, all seven of them,
thunder through a set composed of
old songs ('Broken
Land','Washington Deceased') and
new ( Err, I don't actually know any
of their titles ), and come back for
an encore of just one song, 'Love's
Lost Town'. And then they're gone,
probably for another three years.
Easily one of the best three gigs I've
seen this year. Ace!

• The Adventures played on
Monday. They release a new single,
'Raining All Over the World', on
June 1st through Polydor.
Heart Throbs
-She's in a
Trance
This was definitely not what I was
expecting. Hard rocking, pouting
guitars? No. More a funky beat
with a somewhat fuzzy vocal. The
tempo drops as you progress
through the tracks and her rather
wonderful voice shines through.
Shame about the songs. There is
certainly a feeling that live they
would rock out, and little boys
would throw themselves around to
impress the girls. >

• The Heart Throbs play U L U
tonight to record a live album.
Spectrum
-How You
Satisfy Me
This record shouts Spacemen 3 at
you at around 120 decibels. Weird?
A clear plastic sleeve with some
green, orange and purple printing.
Inside clear vinyl. Weird.
Spacemen 3 may have gone their
seperate ways but Sonic Boom
continues. The elegance and grace
that was so typical remains. The
instrimental tracks on the flip are
wonderful, powerfully understated
and perfectly composed.

• 'How You Satisfy Me' is out now
on One Little Indian.
