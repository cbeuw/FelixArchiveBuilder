22 May 1992 Felix 935 Editorial
Instinct III editorial
Dear Adam,
I was most shocked by the vicious
attack on the reviewer 'Boris' by
Mr Stokes. While Mr Stokes did the
good thing to write a letter to Felix
(unlike the sad number of apathetic
students in IC) having a go at a
reviewer is not very constructive;
mounting personal attacks on
anyone with whom you disagree
won't take you very far in life. I
would like to emphasize that this
doesn't only apply to Mr Stokes'
letter, but also to Mr Pritchard and
Mercer's attack on Lise Yates, as
well as countless attacks in the past,
directed at nearly anyone working
in one of the college's media (Felix,
STOIC and IC Radio).
Enclosed is the review that I have
written for STOIC.
In Basic Instinct, Michael Douglas
plays Nick, a cop who, like every
other cop in USA it seems, has had
problems in the past, but is now
okay. He stumbles across a murder
where the victim was killed with an
ice pick. His primary suspect is
Cathryn, played by the beauteous
Sharon Stone.
Cathryn is not only a 'femme
fatale', but wicked in every action
she takes on earth. Add another
couple of beautiful lesbian and ex-
lesbian females, and everybody,
including Nick and us, is confused
about who did it and what's going
on.
Before the performance, we were
given leaflets by some gay activist
group. The film indeed portrays
lesbian women as ruthless
psychopathic killers. The leaflet is
aimed at protesting against
Hollywood's view of queer
characters.
However, this is in fact N O T a
typical Hollywoodian film. It's got
more sex than anything from
Hollywood, more violence, and an
a typical end. Hollywood hated it.
Why?
Well, the director of the film was
Paul Verhoeven, a dutchman. And
this film has a distinct continental
flavour. It starts at lOOmph, and it
ends abruptly. The audience is
subjected to, open quotes, 'The fuck
of the century', and loose morals
are widely portrayed.
The film made Â£2.65 million in
the U K On the first weekend of
release, and it's been at number one
in the US box office for a couple
of weeks. Some movie critics hated
it, and some loved it. Why would
one hate it? By musunderstanding
it, because this is a film that can be
understood in a number of different
ways. Basic Instinct is not a movie
about sex, not about murder, not
about lesbians, but, as Sharon Stone
herself says, about love.
Unconventional love, that is. If
you keep that in mind, then you'll
rate this film as highly as the Silence
of the lambs. I did. 8 out of 10.
May I also point out the fact that
the f-word was 'beeped' on air and
that, although I wished to have
shares in the film, I was unlucky not
to have acquired some. Judging
from the film's success, I'd be very
rich by now.
Cheers,
Olivier M J Crepin-Leblond,
PG2, Elec Eng.
One of the main purposes of this
paper is to stir up debate - it is only
through debate that the opinions that
form the basis of decisions are
brought to the fore. Felix has been
accused of being 'negative' - though
in my four years here I have never
known Felix accused of anything
else, despite that in looking back,
Felix' stance seemed to be
indifferent, or even faintly
encouraging. In addition, the only
place Felix can have a 'stance' is in
the editorial - the news being based
on fact insofar as it is known, and
if it isn't, then the errors must be
pointed out - the rest of the pages
being comprised of personal
opinions which are open to
anybody. I don't really know why
I am still labouring this point;
perhaps not enough people in the
College have grown up yet to
understand what 'free speech' is.
Everybody benefits from free
speech in the long run.
This particular diatribe was
brought about because of alleged
'anti-CCU' (constituent college
union) bias in Felix. Where? Have
the news team written something
inaccurate? If so, then tell us. Let's
get this clear - I am not anti-CCU
and Felix is not anti-CCU. If people
want them, then I would not be so
arrogant as to tell them otherwise.
I happen to think that more people
should know about the finances of
the CCUs - and ICU, and the
College as well - particularly if the
Unions have to tighten their
financial belts. The taxpayer who is
financing the Unions as well as the
students who should benefit from
them have a right to know that their
money is being spent in a useful and
purposeful manner.

Harassment
Dear Adam,
With respect to last week's letter
about a sexual assault in Southside.
At present there is a lot of work
going into forming a Union Sexual
Harassment Policy describing
actions and procedures to be taken
after cases of harassment.
However, in the mean time,
whenever any students experience
what they perceive to be sexual
harassment whilst in the Union,
they should immediately (if
possible) report it to any member
of Union staff including Bar and
Duty Officers who will assist. They
are easily recognisable by their
'staff tops.' Every reported case
will be treated seriously and in
confidence.
If you wish to report any other
incidents within College then please
come and see Mandy Hurford
(Union Manager) or Stef Ruis
(Union Welfare Advisor).
Yours sincerely,
Zoe Hellinger, ICU President
