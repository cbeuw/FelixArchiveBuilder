22 May 1992 Felix 935 Feature
with anything then just come up to
see us on the third floor of the
Union building. Anyway what do
we need you to help us make? The
news. It may not sound new or
spectacular, but it needs lots of
people editing, filming and
gathering the reports we need. Even
with the Imperial College News
Network (/CNN - but don't blame
me for the name!) extra people will
not go amiss.
'Terminated 3 - I'm back' (or a
title to that effect) is the next STOIC
film, based loosely on a certain film
with a similar title and we're on the
lookout for people to act, film and
help with the sets and effects. This
should be lots of fun, and could be
your break into stardom!
'NEXT!!' is our improvisation
gameshow. Anyone is welcome to
come up and be in the audience or
be in the show. And a new STOIC
gameshow may be started this term,
based on computer games. So if you
enjoy a good blast from time to
time, tell us and you may end up on
the show. We are now also planning
our events for the first days of next
term and making promotional'
videos. We are going to be filming
all the freshers arriving at Southside
and will be broadcasting it live -
certainly something to look forward
to (unless you're a fresher!) Well
there's a description of what we are,
do and want to do, so if you're
interested just nip up to the third
floor of the Union building, or give
us a ring on (0) 3518. Alternatively
come along to our general meeting
on Tuesday at 1.00pm and let us
know what you want. And finally
our schedule for the moment is:
Tuesday 7.00pm Nostalgia night
Thursday 1.00pm STOIC News
Thursday 7.00pm Into the night
CENTRE FOR
COMPOSITE
MATERIALS
European Postgraduate
Course
The Centre for Composite Materials
is one of the organisers of a
European postgraduate course in
polymer and composites
engineering. The course would be
suitable for graduates of science,
engineering or materials science.
In 1992/3 the course will be held at
the University of Louvain-la-Neuve,
Beligium.

Stress followed the lights on the
guidance instrument through a door
marked 'Science Section'. He
wasn't afraid and walked in. Inside
in the dimly lit laboratory bubbling
beakers, boiling baths and burning
bunsens were scattered throughout
the room alongside all manner of
instruments, contraptions and plain
junk. No one was in sight.
'Hello?'
Stress moved cautiously across
the room, fearful of being touched
by the smoke and flames, scared of
the damage they may cause him. In
the middle of the room steps led
down. He followed their motion
and walked down into a massive
low room filled with coffins. Very
The scientist grinned. This made
Stress angrier.
'Why do you think this society is
sick?'
'Because they all get their
pleasure out of hating, hurting,
beating, destroying!'
'But everyone's happy!'
'But they're happy for the worst
of reasons. They're shallow, vain,
pretty, spoilt sadistic animals!
They're so manipulated that they're
desperate to kill themselves!'
'But no one's suffering because
of it. All the hate is directed towards
the pale ones who don't exist. The
lowest class of this society don't feel
so bad because they know they're
not as bad as the pale people.
'It stops the water supply being
injected with chemical soporifics. It
stops the hollowglam machine.
Turns the lizard transparent so the
citizens can see the outside world,
the media hollowglams start giving
them the truth.'
Stress was pleased.'
'Who were in those coffins?'
The scientist spoke tonelessly.
'Rewarded executives. The
citizens become hollowglams as a
reward. The executives' reward is
to be placed in a coffin where they
are linked completely into a reality
of their choosing. They get to do
whatever they want and never suffer
because of it.'
'How do I get out?'
Stress indicated his bonds.
The Inner System
high tech coffins that each contained
a human, carefully wrapped in coils
and foil, instruments and pumps
extending from every orifice, every
gate to the interior. By the side of
the coffin was a small screen
surrounded by buttons. Stress
pressed the one marked 'view'.
The screen came on showing a
barbarian warrior in the primitive
camp killing armed peasants left
right and centre, torching the huts
and running off with small, finely
detailed model locomotives. Stress
was confused and was about to look
at another coffin when someone
pressed an injection gun to his neck.
He passed out.
And woke up in the laboratory,
locked into a chair opposite a
friendly man in a lab coat. The
scientist smiled at him.
'Why am I tied up?'
'For your own good. You've
.beenTunning around like a madman
causing all sorts of damage.'
'With good reasons!!'
'What reasons?'
The scientist waited for an
answer. Stress was glad to give it.
'To stop this sick society!'
Getting them all to hate another
group really pulls them together.
They want suicide because they're
going to receive something
wonderful in return.'
'But why keep up the charade, the
fiction?'
'Because if we don't give them a
great reason to die they'll always be
in fear, their suffering will increase
as they approach death, rather than
decrease. This way there's no
danger. Surely a bad action is
alright when no one suffers its
effects?'
The scientist smiled.
'NO!!'
Stress pulled the truth gun out and
shot the scientist. The smiled faded.
Stress savoured the moment.
'Firstly.'
Stress was enjoying the pain on
the scientists features.
'Where is the mechanism that
will change the system?'
'In the stadium on the pedestal.
The mechanism is activated by
twisting the symbol of the inner
system, a statue at the centre of the
pedestal.'
'What will it do?'
'Press your left index finger to
the back of your right ear?'
'WHAT?!'
'You are a fictional reality. I have
given you the action key to escape.'
Stress obeyed. He passed out.
And came to inside one of the
coffins. With a terrible hangover he
ripped off the cables attached to him
and pushed the lid away.
. 'And how do you know this isn't
a fictional reality?
The scientist was sitting across
from him, smiling. Stress gleefully
shot him again. The bolt deflected
off a screen around the man.
T have a devout belief screen
around me. Type A7, the truth of
science, totally impregnable. So
how do you know this isn't a
fictional reality?'
'Easy, your fictional realities are
all suffering free for the subject,
aren't they.'
'Yes.'
Stress walked away across the
laboratory. The scientist called after
him.
'It's all fictional reality out there!'
Not for much longer, thought
Stress.
