• LOST: Black leather jacket. Did
you pick up the wrong jacket on
Friday 8th May?. The jacket I
picked up is size 42, labelled 'best
quality leather, genuine cowhide'
and had blue woolen gloves and
khaki net scarf in the pockets. If this
is yours, please find me so that we
can swap back as my jacket was a

value. Kierran McCullough, Aero
