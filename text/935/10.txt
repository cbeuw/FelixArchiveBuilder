Feature Felix 935 22 May 1992
'Very good, welcome in Egypt!'
were the first words that the taxi
driver shouted at me as we sped into
the centre of Cairo. It was still early
morning and a cool breeze swept
across my face. On the horizon lay
a dusty collection of buildings and
an intense orange sun broke through
the mystical blue fog that hung
around them.
I was dropped at Midan Talaat
Harb, the 'centre' of Cairo and the
area for budget hotels. This was the
beginning of my three week
expedition to sample some of
Egypt's ancient and modern
treasures. I was soon checked into
acclimatizing to the heat and
sampling the food. With a change
in diet and the poor standard of
hygiene in some restaurants it was
inevitable that I was bound to be
struck by, what is known in Egypt
as, 'Pharaohs revenge'. This
unfortunate bowel condition can
strike anywhere and at any time so
you soon learn to carry a few
essential items around with you.
Egypt is predominantly a muslim
country. Everywhere you travel tall
minarets pierce the blue skyline.
You will also become aware of the
muslim practice of prayer five times
a day. I was made only too aware
The Pharoah's Revenge
The land of the
Pyramids, the
birthplace of
one of the oldest
civilisations in
the world has
long drawn
visitors. Richard
Lyle reports
a dark and dusty hotel and eager to
inaugurate my trip.
Venturing out on to the crowded
and congested streets that had lost
the serenity that I had witnessed
earlier, I battled my way through a
barrage of people and cars as a
fierce sun beat down on my neck.
Wandering amongs't the bedlam and
fumes I wondered what the Ancient
Egyptians would have made of
today's madness. Modern Cairo is
a huge sprawling unplanned city
with an estimated population of up
to 18 million people - the total
population of the country is
estimated at 51 million.
My first goal was the Egyptian
museum. This unimposing building
houses an awesome collection of
relics from Egypt's long and varied
history. The infamous treasures of
Tut Ankh Amoun can also be found
here. My battling continued, this
time through droves of tourists, as
I tried to view the solid gold mask
and other relics found in the burial
chamber of this celebrated Pharaoh.
I spent my first few days in Egypt
of this when I stayed in a hotel close
to a mosque. Having wondered why
the rates that they had offered were
such a bargain the answer came in
the early hours of the following
morning - I was rudely awakened
by the deafening call to prayer. And
of course just as I was drifting back
to sleep the car horns and general
hustle and bustle commenced.
There are many sites to see in
Cairo itself including ancient
mosques, the Citadel (a medieval
fortress and the sight of Old Cairo),
a camel market, on the outskirts of
the city the Great Pyramids of Giza
and many interesting bazaars, such
as Khan el Khalili.
Shopping for local handicrafts
and the odd souvenir or two is
almost inevitable on any trip
abroad. Many of the traders that
you find in Egypt are ruthless
businessmen and will make you feel
distinctly guilty if you do not buy
what they have to sell. Khan el
Khalili is an excellent place to make
some purchases. This is reputedly
the worlds largest bazaar and is
found close to the Citadel. Here the
eager tradesmen coax you into their
tiny shops crammed with treasures.
Making a purchase can be an
extremely civilised and enjoyable
experience. Having myself
expressed an interest and entered a
shop I was offered a cup of tea.
Whilst I was relaxing with my drink
the bargaining began. After a short
period of haggling I was offered a
'special price for you only' for the
silver jewellery that I had decided
to buy. I drew out a wad of tatty and
dog-eared cash. I thought this
money was going to disintegrate
into a thousand pieces as I handed
it over to my smiling and most
appreciative recipient.
Once I had sampled the delights
of Cairo I took the overnight train
to Luxor, and although in second
class the carriage still had the luxury
of air-conditioning. My 14 hour
journey never contained a dull
moment. Everywhere I turned there
was commotion of one sort or
another going on as old men argued
and traders drifted by offering all
sorts of goods.
As you weave your way around
this intriguing country you will soon
realise that Egypt is littered with
ancient relics and monuments.
Luxor was no exception. On arrival
at this place a multitude of
attractions awaited me - the great
Temple of Karnak, which was
added to and modified over two and
a half thousand years; the Valley of
the Kings, containing the tombs of
many Pharaohs including Tut Ankh
Amoun, Ramses I, II and III; the
Temple of Queen Hatshepsut; the
Ramesseum; the Valley of the
Queens; the Tombs of the Nobles;
and the Luxor Temple.
There is also, of course, the Nile
which provides a spectacular sight.
Feluccas can be seen gracefully
winding their way across the

shimmering waters of this river.
These Egyptian sail boats that have
transported goods up and down the
Nile for centuries. In more recent
times they have transported a more
lucrative cargo - tourists. With such
a beautiful location it is no surprise
that a sunset ride along the Nile is
a must for most visitors to Luxor.
After a long and hot days
sightseeing there is no better way
to round it all off by sinking a few
pints of the locally brewed 'Stella'
beer. However I must offer a
warning for any would be
consumers. Do not drink too much
unless you want to experience the
worst hangover of your life - the hot
and dry climate coupled with the
fact that the beer is somewhat rough
in nature ensures this. After
overdoing it myself I vaguely
remember falling into bed,
extremely drunk. Lying on my bed
bathed in sweat, in my oven for a
room, I was hit by an unusually
large bout of paranoia. Above me
the blades of the roof fan seemed
to be moving very erratically, in
fact rocking wildly from side to
side, on their loose fittings. The
concept of gravity took on its full
meaning as I wondered how this
antique contraption could possibly
stay up there.
As my trip unfolded I was
overwhelmed by the variety of
methods of transport available:
buses, taxis, camels, donkeys,
bicycles, horse and carriages or
feluccas. I took the bus to Aswan.
On boarding the already full bus I
remember being relieved to find a
space on the back seat. As the
journey got under way I soon
realised why no one had wanted to
sit here - the seat was situated
directly over the noisy engine which
blasted heat up into this end of the
bus. This coupled with the fact that
the bus was equipped with
'Egyptian air conditioning' (cooled
by opening the window) and I was
dreadfully hung over from the night
before, turned my five hour bus ride
along the Nile into a living
nightmare.
The further south that you travel
in Egypt the hotter and drier it gets.
This fact becomes blatantly
apparent in Aswan. I arrived at
midday and the heat was stifling.
Once I had checked into my hotel
the only solution to the heat and my
testing bus ride was an afternoon
siesta.
Whilst in Aswan I took a number
of felucca rides around the islands
littered across the Nile. I also
visited Abu Simbel, the site of a
spectacular giant temple to Ramses
II, on the shore of lake Nasser. It
seems crazy that we drove for 280
km across barren desert, the
horizon marred only by the
occasional group of rugged
mountains, just to see this ternple.
Then we drove all the way back to
Aswan by the same route. I suppose
the expression 'when in Rome'
springs to mind here - or perhaps
'when in Egypt.'
Having returned to Cairo by train
my next goal was the monastery of
Saint Catherine located on the Sinai
peninsular. My pilgrimage was a
visit to Mount Sinai, the acclaimed
site of the ten commandments.
Having stayed the night at the
monastery's hostel I rose at three
the next morning and set off for the
two hour hike to the summit of
mount Sinai. Whilst climbing the
meandering path in the darkness I
gazed up and witnessed a most
biblical sight - silhouetted against
the stars were three camels,
complete with riders, which
reminded me of the story of three
wise men. On reaching the summit
I rested to watch the sun rise. It was
a spectacular sight. The barren
â€¢ i i i i i l i l h

mountains became a radiant orange-
red colour as the sun came up
revealing the desolate landscape.
No holiday to an exotic country
is complete without a few days
slumbering on the beach. The town
of.Hurghada situated on the shores
of the Red Sea provided me with
my fix of sun, sea and siesta. On
one of my days there I took a trip
out to the nearby islands and coral
reefs. This is a popular day trip and
boat loads of eager tourists are
shipped out to a selection of coral
sites in the area. As these boats
descend on these areas droves of
masked beings can be seen jumping
in all directions from them. After
a short period they are herded off
to some other reef or a beach for
the whole process to continue. All
the same it is a good day out even
if at times you felt a little like a
sheep following the herd. The water
is also warm and crystal clear, in
fact when swimming it seems as
though you are floating in a gigantic
swimming pool.
At the end of my trip I had
enough time for a final visit to the
Pyramids. Sitting in a nearby cafe
sucking on a water pipe as the sun
dropped to its sandy horizon,
silhouetting these giant stone relics,
I was certainly in a pensive mood.
In three weeks I had witnessed some
six thousand years of history and on
this evening I was watching just one
more sunset in the long life of these
magnificent monuments to
mankind.
