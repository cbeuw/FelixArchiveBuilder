Opinion Felix 935 22 May 1992
The implementation of a students'
charter now looks imminent.
Westminster sources have indicated
to / C N N that the students' charter
will be one of several charters to be
discussed at a meeting in Ten
Downing Street, on 19th June. This
meeting will be attended by the new
Charter minister, William
Waldegrave, and the new Education
Secretary, John Patten, amongst
others.
The Conservative Student
Charter Stall was set out by one of
their national officers, Kevin
Shinkwin, last February. Speaking
to IC Radio, Mr Shinkwin said., 'we-
want to see grants paid on time; we
want to see local education
authorities get their act together and
make sure that the cheques are there
when the students get back from
holidays ... we want to see loans
extended.... and we also want to see

The students' charter is expected
to follow the pattern already laid
down by other charters. Its
measures are expected to be fairly
limited, concentrating on little
irritants rather than taking a wider
view and tackling issues sucrTas
institutional underfunding, staff-
student morale, and student
financial support.
While no specific details are yet
available, Conservative Studdhts
have outlined a package of ideas for
inclusion in a charter. Conservative
Students, or Conservative
Collegiate Forum, are rapidly
becoming the power behind the
educational throne, and their ideas
are the best indication of how
government is thinking. Their
chairman, Rob Marvin, recently
had high level discussions with the
new Higher Education Minister,
Nigel Forman. These discussions
left Mr Marvin 'confident' that
work set in train by Conservative
Students before the election would
continue to be carried out by the
new Minister.
an extension of free speech on
campus.'
The imminence of the charter's
introduction was acknowledged by
Conor Pickering, another officer on
the Conservative Student national
executive. Mr Pickering told /CNN
that 'reform of student unions will
come through the Citizen's
Charter.'
The charter was originally
discussed at a Downing Street
meeting in January 1992. The then
Education Secretary, Kenneth
Clarke, described the charter as an
idea the Department of Education
and Science (DES) would need to
look at. However, with the election
then pending any new charter work
was construed by DES officials as
a party political matter, and so the
idea was shelved until after the
election.
The Conservative election
manifesto contained a typically
vague passage which read, 'we are
putting in place new mechanisms to
ensure that academic standards are
maintained in higher education.'
Though charter watchers took this
to refer to a students' charter, the
particular extract could have
referred to anything.
This trick of placing woolly
words in a manifesto so that
subsequent legislation can be said
to have the mandate of the people
is an old one. It was employed to
great effect with the poll tax,
introduced following a four line
dash in the 1987 manifesto. In much
the same way that the poll tax was
the hidden agenda behind reform of
the rating system, is there a hidden
agenda behind the students' charter?
Not really. There is no hidden
agenda insofar as the agenda has
already been publicly set. The only
difference is that the agenda has
been set, not by the government,
but by Conservative Students.
Looking behind the charter's initial
superficiality, it's clear that when
Conservative Students talk of
reform, they mean the annihilation
of the National Union of Students
(NUS). Indeed, Conservative
Students have compared the
introduction of the charter to the
trade union reforms of the early
1980s. Conor Pickering told / C N N
that 'in the same way as the 1980s
saw the Government reform trade
unions, so the 1990s will see the
reform of student unions.'
Herein lies the simplest and most
injurious way to 'reform' the NUS.
Conservative Students intend to
liquidate the NUS by reforming or
destroying every single college
student union in the country.
Currently, all students are
automatic members of their
respective college student union.
This means that Imperial students
are members of their constituent
college union (CCU), the parent
Imperial College Union (ICU), and
the University of London Union
(ULU). There is no choice in this
matter.
Decisions on affiliation to the
NUS are made on a campus wide
basis only. If a college student
union affiliates, then every member
of that college student union is a
member of the NUS. The concept
of individual membership of the
NUS does not exist. A student
cannot join the NUS if its college
student union is not affiliated. A
student cannot leave the NUS if its
college student union decides to
affiliate.
Conservative Students have long
sought to reduce the membership of
the NUS. In the past, they tried to
force introduction of voluntary
membership to the NUS. Under
this, students could leave or join the
NUS as they pleased - though they
would still be members of their
college student union. Conservative
