Feature Felix 935 22 May 1992
STOIC is the student television
service for Imperial College
students. Why point out this basic
fact you ask? STOIC seems to be
Crepin-Leblond, whose idea it was,
and to Ronjoy Choudhury, who did
the (very good) artwork for the
video. The second award was third
STOIC goes into the Night
place in the documentary section
with a report on last year's Japan
Festival. Thanks for this must go to
Alex Wiedmann for this. STOIC
was also complemented on the
technical quality of its material,
with the news intro being thought
so good that it sparked off a new
category for next year for the best
titles. In this week's Into the Night
(Thursday 28th, from 7.00pm) we
will be showing the award winning
programmes and also some of the
material that we have obtained from
some of the other student television
stations that attended.
That is the past - what about the
future? On the technical front, the
network to Southside and Prince's
gardens should now be well and
truly fixed, but do bear with us if
it isn't - we've over four miles of
cable to check! The sound quality
should also be much better due to
our recently acquired compressor
which should eliminate much of the
buzzing noise. Unfortunately our
second frame store and cameras
have both ceased to function, so we
are a little restricted as to what we
can do at the moment, but we
should hopefully have it all fixed
soon.
On the programme front we have
lots of ideas but still not enough
people. So if you feel like helping
Carl Fairhurst
gives an
introduction as
to what has
been occupying
STOIC of late
and what will
be shown on
College screens
in the future
less well known than the other two
Union publications (Felix and IC
Radio), and in this article I hope to
inform and show you just what
STOIC does, and why.
A complaint we quite often get is
that the actual output of
programmes is small. We can't
argue with this point as it's true.
Compared with IC Radio, for
example, we broadcast our own
material only a few times a week.
But this is not due to laziness - a
television programme will on
average take over ten times the
length of a radio programme to
think of, record and edit. This
means that one hour of STOIC
programmes will have taken at least
ten hours to prepare, and quite often
much longer.
Even though our output is fairly
small, it is of a high standard.
During the Easter holidays NaSTA
'92 took place. This is the National
Student Television Association
conference, and this year it was
based at Brighton Polytechnic.
During the conference there were
award ceremonies for different
programme categories and STOIC
walked away with two awards. The
first was for the best video to music,
and we were awarded the first prize
for our Valentine's Day video.
