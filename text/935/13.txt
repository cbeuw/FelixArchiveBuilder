Wayne's World
along that makes you laugh, makes
you cry, makes you glad to be alive.
This is that movie N O T !
That's what the advertising said
about Wayne's World, the story of
Wayne Nibblet Cambell and his
chief bud, Garth. About how they
are convinced by Rob Lowe,
(Gimp), posing as a bigtime T V
magnate (Shyyeeah! Rriight!), that
their show, Wayne's World, is
ready for big time. Only Rob Lowe
has other plans (see his diary:
Thursday; rip off small time T V
show). Boy, the world does indeed
suck.
In the process, the sphincter
attempts to seduce Cassandra, (Tia
Carrere. SCHWING!!), described
in the film as 'babelicious', and
almost destroys relations between
Wayne and Garth. Wow!
Some people may say this is a Bill
and Ted rip off. I'd say, 'Yeah and
monkeys might fly out of my butt'.
Both films have characters saying
'Excellent, Woah, Party on', but
the comparison ends there. Bill and
Ted were stoners, Wayne and Garth
are ultimate metal fans. Literally
transplanted out of a cartoon, they
are the personification of kids fears
and hopes, i.e. Wayne always says
Gladiator
Gladiator is a film set in the illegal
boxing areas of Chicago's south
side.The film opens with Seal's
'Killer' and sees the entrance of a
new kid Tommy Riley (James
Marshall) at a local school. He
immediately gets hassled by one of
the gangs there.
Tommy lives in a run down
apartment with his Dad, who gets
a job which means he has to leave
his son at home. Pressed with his
Dad's gambling debts, Tommy
agrees to fight to get the money to
pay them off. At the same time he
shows the promoters what he's
made of. They then rope him into
fighting some more - something
Tommy doesn't want to do, but he
has no way out.
The film then sees one of his
friends sent to hospital and finally,
Tommy is made to fight a friend,
Lincoln, who has been advised not
to fight as a blow to his head could
kill him. Tommy talks Lincoln out
of it and asks to fight the promoter
and ex-heavyweight boxer, Horn,
who is the one causing all the
trouble for him. Here we have the
final fight. Horn is played by Brian
Dennehy.
The film lacks originality and
could almost be described as a 1992
remake of Rocky. The main
character, Tommy, was boring and
emotionless. It was dull and bland
in places. Decidedly average.
Andy
and does the right thing, he was
raised on Bugs Bunny and that's
who he really thinks he is. Garth,
on the other hand, is constantly
afraid of saying the wrong thing,
which he almost always does.
The jokes are there thick and fast,
along with extreme close ups,
zooms, shameless product plugs
and a myriad of E X C E L L E N T
guest stars! Plus, 3-count 'em- 3
alternative endings. It really is a
hilarious film.
Do Wayne and Garth live on to
party and rid the world of
unnecessary sphincters? Of course
they do N O T !

West End from today, dudes.
Turner's
Crossing
Everyone knows the bag people.
The bagman huddles under
Queensgate porches with an old
Sainsbury's trolley full of stuffed
Europa bags. The baglady in
Turner's Crossing clings to her
traffic island home with the same
impacable tenacity. Never mind the
fact that she's in the middle of a
building site, 'marooned in a sea of
mud'. She has quite deliberately
rooted herself in what she claims is
her 'house', in full view of the
disapproving wife of the site
developer, Dan Turner. As a three-
way psychological battle begins
between the Turners and the
baglady, it becomes clear that Dan's
development scheme in his home
village is a two-fingered salute to
the locals, with his wife realising it
is becoming an obsession. Not to be
out-acted, the barmy baglady claims
that Dan is HER husband. Whether
it is make-believe or faint
recollection is eerily blurred. The
local priest, concerned at 'the mud
everywhere', keeps popping up at
inopportune moments to provide a
moral and social commentary. But
even he can't stop the descent into
muddy mayhem.
The acting, and humour,
improved as the play progressed,
except for the baglady, who was
superb throughout. The end,
though, left me wondering if I had
blinked during an important
revelation. Reassuringly, my*
neighbour also looked a little
confused. But endings aside, it's
definitely worth braving East
Croydon for. If you don't mind
being hit by flying crockery.
