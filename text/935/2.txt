Bloody Typical Yates' Return
Dear Felix.
Thanks for the news about the
Sports Centre. It's just bloody
typical of IC.
At present I am a range-officer at
the gun club and next year I will be
the treasurer and will take on a
major slice of the running of the
club. Unfortunately we get
practically all of our new members
in the first term of the year and, like
all other clubs, require a certain
number of members to get our
grants. The liklihood of getting a
sufficient membership starting just
after Chistmas is very slim. This
will mean that in two years time we
will be, a minor club with no one
sufficiently capable or experienced
enough to run it. The club will then
have to close (we don't elect people
to run the club—guns are dangerous
things and should only be handled
by experienced people). The
College will then turn our range into
the Cafe that they've always
wanted. (To go along side the
bloody stupid sun beds, no doubt).
Bloody great!

Dear Adam,
By way of a vain space filler (take
that as you wish), a few points on
the recent news.
1. 'The truth about the Union Bar.'
Just to restate things, because we
got that sentance wrong, the whole
tone of the script/article changed.
Indeed, it could be argued that
getting that sentence wrong meant
that we got the script/article wrong.
This is why I have withdrawn the
sentence and apologised for the
script/article. These apologies go
not only to Jarv and Ramesh, but
also to Andy and staff. Sorry.
2. 'Financial confusion.'
Yours in a really pissed-off (but
saw it coming) mood,
Myles W A Davison.
P.S. We aren't the only club to
use the range and in the last year
we have received approaches for
range time from the Natwest Bank
and a local school—so what will
happen to them?
The line of argument advanced
above does not apply to this story.
Firstly, there was nothing wrong in
the story. There was a slight
ambiguity in the wording, due to the
legal nature of the story and a
misunderstanding between myself
and my source, a source so highly
placed that checking the story
further with Silwood was irrelevant.
Irrelevant is also a good description
of the criticism that Silwood made
about the story. It's a long time
since someone from there actually
phoned here with a story (gripe,
gripe, rant.)
3. 'A spanner in the works.'
Dear Adam,
Re: Pritchard/Mercer letter.
'We.. .complete bullshit':
Reviews are personal opinions, and
this particular review was mine.
'.. .did not attend the concert...':
This is an insult to my integrity, and
if you read the review in full, you
would notice a number of remarks,
A witty headline. Who did it refer
to?
The suggestion about the
introduction of voluntary
membership was just that. A
suggestion. However, due to the
potentially lethal consequences of
the introduction of voluntary
membership to Imperial College
Union, I suggest that a trial be done
instead. Introduce voluntary
membership to the C C U s
(Constituent College Unions)
instead.
With continuing good wishes.

News Editor, IC Radio.
not discernable from the radio, such
as the existence of Candyland.
'... musical taste of a leek.': Quite
possibly. However I have never yet
admitted to liking the Manic Street
Preachers or The Alarm. No Welsh
bands at all, in fact.
'...suffering from a severe case
of PMT.': I'll take the leek.
'...vast number of people...':
Let's face it, the touts were selling
tickets for less than face value, and
the venue wasn't overly packed.
However, I am not going to criticise
those people who were there. If this
is their idea of a good time, so be it.
'...credibility of the L A legal
system.': At least you responded to
my review in a more civilised
manner than the citizens of Los
Angeles.
'...on actually listening to some
Shakespear's Sister...': It's hard to
avoid it with 'Stay' becoming the
Bryan Adams of 1992.
'...'Goodbye, Cruel World'...':
Fair point, but I find that knowledge
of song's titles is irrelevant to their
worth.
' . . . T Don't Care' has not been
released': It had, and anyway,
Poddy adds those bits himself after
submission.
'...laryngitis...': if they choose to
play, they should accept any
criticism levelled at them.
'...get yourself another
reviewer...': I'm sure any new
reviewers would be welcomed with
open arms; I was.
Love,
Lise Yates.
