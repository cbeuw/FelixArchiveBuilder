Opinion Felix 935 22 May 1992
.. if this is NUS
activity then the
government is
paying students
for activity the
students have
not themselves
approved. The
Government is
paying for its
own subversion
accountable to all, though apathy
tends to get in the way. Arguments
to show that this would be improved
on by voluntary membership have
yet to be advanced.
The most damaging aspects of
voluntary membership have yet to
be fully explored. Under voluntary
membership, college student unions
face potential cash shortages. If they
are unable to maintain their current
levels of membership, then their
funds will drop. This means that
cuts will have to be imposed, and
services reduced. It could also mean
students having to pay supplements
on their memberships for individual
societies.
If IC Union runs short of money,
what is at risk? This is difficult to
assess, and it depends on the extent
of the fall off in membership. If the
government were to say to the
average student, 'here is £80. You
can join ICU, you can join a C C U ,
you can join Conservative Students,
or you can spend it,' there should
be no doubt about where a
significant number of people will
spend this £ 8 0 . Especially if
students do not fully appreciate
what will be lost by not joining their
college student union.
Almost certain to be hit first will
be clubs and societies. Members
will find themselves either facing a
rapid reduction in funding, a slicing
of services, a substantial increase in
membership fees, or all three.
Many clubs, most clubs, your club
could and will go to the wall.
Sporting clubs will be hit hard.
These clubs already have to pay a
proportion of their costs. This
charge could rapidly become 100%
of their costs.
DramSoc, OpSoc, and other
S C A B (Social, Cultural and
Amusement Board) societies would
have to stage self funding
productions. Not just productions
that make a profit, but productions
that can pay for themselves before
they happen. The last production of
'Grease' was half underwritten by
the CCus alone. Under voluntary
membership, the CCUs would have
to become self funding themselves,
attracting their own membership,
facing a dire future.
All publications would certainly
cease. The only potential survivor
would be Felix, which may be able
to attract enough advertising to
survive, and which could levy a
cover charge. IC Radio could
become a community service, and
thus lose the purpose of its
existence. STOIC? Deepest
sympathy.
Sympathy also for ICU Rag,
which could see itself fundraising
simply to pay for the Imperial
College Union welfare service. The
welfare service brings out another
drawback in the voluntary
membership scheme. Should
welfare advice be given to non-
members of the union? Could the
situation arise where a student
knocks on the welfare officer's
door, on the brink of eviction, only
to be told that an £ 8 0 membership
fee has to be paid before advice can
be given? Will all students be
checked for membership before
they even enter the union building?
This apartheid system will also
apply to other trading outlets. Will
non members be allowed to use the
bookshop? Will there be checks on
the door? Will there be a two tier
system, double pricing, different
checkouts? Will students find
themselves barred from the union
bars? Will non members be charged
a higher rate than members? Who
will the union snackbar be open to?
Members? Non-members? Will any
of these trading outlets survive
financially, remembering that at the
minute they are all running to
profit?
Decisions, decisions. What gets
cut? What closes first? Who gets
turned away? None of these are
voluntary decisions.
The results of voluntary
membership could be catastrophic.
The proposals threaten to destroy a
major part of the educational
system, and the fabric of college
life. Why are these proposals being
put forward? To increase
'accountability', or to crush the the
NUS - a dormant pussycat dressed
in lion's clothing, an organisation
that fools no-one, not even itself?
These proposals are being put
forward by Conservative Students,
a body that lives off the back of the
student union system like a parasite.
Last year, IC ConSoc received
£520 of IC Union money. This
year, it is claiming for £535. Some
of this money will be used to
affiliate to Conservative Students,
and to Conservative Collegiate
Forum. This organisation is itself
funded by the Conservative Party.
Its chairman, Rob Marvin, worked
for the Conservative Party in Bath
during the election.
the result of
voluntary
membership
could be
catastrophic
It is not only a case of
government's money making its
way back to the party of
government. It is a case of students'
union money, Imperial College
Union money, being used, in
however small a way, to fund the
destruction of Imperial College
Union, and all its services. A
biologist told me before that a
cancer is described as a malignant
disease, which spreads by deriving
benefit from the host, and by
spreading destroys the host. If the
Union is the host, then Conservative
Students are the cancer in the
student body. They are, to quote
Mrs Thatcher, 'the enemy within.'
