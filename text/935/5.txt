22 May 1992 Felix 935 Opinion
Students have now hit on a scheme
which, under current
circumstances, would allow
individual students to leave the NUS
but would not allow individual
students to join the NUS.
The crux of the scheme is that the
NUS only allows whole college
student unions to affiliate. If
students were given the option of
joining a college student union,
rather than being forced to join it,
and then if that union were to
affiliate to the NUS, the student
could leave the college student
union, and thus the NUS. However,
if a college student union were to
decide not to affiliate to the NUS,
then an individual student could not
join the NUS as the entire college
student union needs to affiliate.
This is an opt out policy, but not
an opt in policy. It is known as
voluntary membership.
All IC students are members of
a C C U , ICU and U L U . CCUs are
funded by ICU. ICU is funded by
the College. The College is funded
by the Universities Funding Council
( U F C ) . U F C is funded by
Government. Thus, runs the
argument, the government funds
college student unions. An essential
addition to this is that the
government's money is taxpayers'
money.
Imperial College
Union money is
being used to
fund its own
destruction
If this argument is continued to
its logical conclusion, then the
taxpayer is paying for other student
activities through the student grant.
For instance most alcohol
consumed by students in the union
bar, most of the food eaten by the
same students, and the taxpayer is
left simply scraping the vomit from
Exhibition Road. By a subtle shift
of imperception, the government is
paying for political activities of
student unions. And if some of this
activity is the NUS activity, then the
government is paying students for
activity that the students have not
themselves approved. The
government is paying for its own
subversion.
This is where voluntary
membership comes in. The theory
behind it is that students are given
the option of joining the college
student union, and so can exercise
more control over its workings.
Instead of giving government
money to student college unions
through college, the money is
instead given to students directly,
who then decide whether to join the
college students union or not.
The scheme breaks down quite
comprehensively when applied to
the on the ground situation. The
first simple question is on how
much money individual students are
given to join the union. At present,
Imperial College pays between
£75-£80 per student to Imperial
College Union. Thus, it appears
that the government, under
voluntary membership, would give
an additional £75-£80 to each
student. The government would not
only have empowered students with
the grudging authority to spend this
sum, they can also brazenly claim
to have increased the levels of
student financial support. But not
before long, this sum would be
absorbed in the main grant
payment.
The major problem with this
scenario is that the figure of £75-
£80 has been set by College. All
College funding is given by U F C
to the College for the College to
spend according to its budget.
Money for ICU and the CCUs is
included in this block grant. U F C
does not add a little note saying that
x amount is to be paid to the unions.
Union money is not ringfenced.
Therefore, it is not possible to
identify a specific amount of
government money that funds the
student unions, save that which the
college itself identifies. With the
decisions on union funding resting
with individual colleges, it cannot
be said that every student pays the
same amount for student union
membership, because of the
collegiate variations. It would thus
be exceptionally difficult, though
not impossible, for government to
decide on a national flat rate to be
allocated to each student in lieu of
union membership. Beside this, a
flat rate would fail completely to
take into account regional variations
in the cost of goods, services, rent
and staff salaries.
The assumption that 'by giving
students the option of joining their
union then the union will become
more accountable' is itself highly
questionable. If a students' union
were to pursue a divisive policy,
then the immediate reaction of those
opposed to the move would be to
leave the union. Again, the
precedent is set by those students
who hadn't the guts nor the stomach
to reform the NUS from within and
left to join that lunatic fringe,
Conservative Students.
If the proposed policy is
especially militant, then the
departure of the opposing
moderates would make the existing
union even less accountable to
mainstream opinion. Or is that what
the Conservative plan for voluntary
membership is designed to do?
Thus, it is not proven that
voluntary membership would make
college student unions more
accountable. Indeed, despite all
criticisms levelled, Imperial
College Union is potentially
why are these
proposals being
put forward?
To increase
'accountability'
or to crush
the NUS - an
organisation
that doesn't
even fool itself?
