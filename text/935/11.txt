Feature Felix 935 22 May 1992
At the crack of dawn on the first
day of the Easter holidays, sixteen
divers made their way through the
wreckage left outside the Union to
our cellar. It was not a pretty sight
- none of us having had time to
recover from the night before. In an
operation that was the most efficient
we have ever managed we loaded
thirty air tanks, one very heavy
outboard motor, an inflatable boat,
forty sacks of dive gear and various
other vital bits and pieces into two
groaning vans. At the last minute
we threw in a couple of surfboards
and our water-skis, just in case.
Hopes were high as we left London,
Diving the Lizard
and were ready for something a bit
more adventurous - half an hour of
swimming around kelp bed is
enough to dampen anybody's
enthusiasm. Little did they know
what was in store for the next few
days.
In the afternoon we managed to
pump some life into our ageing
inflatable and under the sturdy
seamanship of Rolf 'Fizz' Tietemer
the day's second dive took place a
little further out on the same kelp
bed. No one was too worried by this
lack of variety, we all hoped that
better things were in store for the
coming days, for which we had
hired a bigger and faster boat from
a local boatman.
As we went to bed on Monday
morning the ominous sounds of the
scattered over the bottom of a kelp
bed during WWII. There was no
choice but to take another plunge
amongst the weed and look for
edible wildlife. When all the day's
deeds were done the final score was
ICUC 1: CRABs 1. Tom Brown
and I managed to capture a monster
crustacean, only for it to claim its
revenge, drawing blood from one
of the hapless divers' fingers. At the
end of the day we all passed out
dreaming of exciting wreck dives to
come.
Neptune was still against us on
Tuesday, the wind had now
increased to force 8. The diving in
Falmouth was beginning to look a
little limited in these conditions and
Steve was scraping the bottom of
the barrel to find us anywhere to go.

ignoring the weather forecasts that
all seemed to be predicting gale
force winds whipping along the
Cornish coast.
We arrived at our luxury caravan
site with plenty of time to make
ourselves at home in the local pub
and spin some salty yarns, designed
to turn all but the hardiest novice
into a quivering heap of jelly. As
we staggered to our beds after a
slight overdose we tried our best not
to notice the way the caravans were
starting to rock as the wind gathered
strength.
Sunday dawned brightish and
clearish, despite expectations, and
was the first day's diving for the
new boys and girls. They were
taken off to a nice sheltered cove
and thrown in, accompanied by
some of our more expert members.
All reappeared half an hour later
wind could again be heard
beginning to shake the frail
caravans.
There were many sick looking
faces at the briefing later that
morning. The vans had rocked so
much through the night that they felt
like we were already at sea. The
Met Office did not do much to
lighten the day, reporting Force 7
gales on the coast set to continue for
the rest of the week. When we
pulled up at the harbour we were
greeted by the harbour master and
a small crowd of locals who
muttered darkly and shook their
heads as we told them of our plans.
Despite all these ill omens the
decision was made to face the
elements head on. The only
sheltered site Steve the Skipper
could suggest was the last resting
place of the 'Falmouth Subs',
We dropped off the boat into 8m of
water by the lighthouse and spent
half and hour being thrown around
by the swell. The local point of
interest was a set of gulleys leading
towards the headland, everyone
managed to find them except Pete
Bowen and his buddy. Pete claimed
later that he had gone in exactly the
opposite direction on purpose. He
was, however, unable to explain
why. It was about this stage of the
holiday that we noticed that the
stress was beginning to tell on Pete,
our beloved chairman.
Unfortunately the effect of all the
tough decisions the weather had
forced him to take was making his
already sparse hair fall out. This
disturbing trend was set to continue
for the rest of the week despite the
ministrations of Rhoda, his
medically qualified deputy.
