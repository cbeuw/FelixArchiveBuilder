22 May 1992 Felix 935 Clubs & Societies
Cadwell - in the middle of
nowhere, or Lincolnshire, which
amounts to the same thing. Three
and a half hours and 150 miles from
home we were faced with a
gleaming collection of brand new
VFR400RS (a motorbike),
£1000-worth Diadora leathers and
our instructor, Simon 'Kiwi'
Crater.
No sooner had I got my lid on
than we were up to the line for the
first five laps at following the
leader. We'd been sniggering at the
previous groups' attempts at the
hairpin bend - I remember telling
everyone not to laugh because at
least one of us would end up going
straight on. The first attempt were
designed as Mearn-the-lines' laps,
then there were five 'try-them-out-
yourself laps being watched by the
instructor behind, then five 'try-
and-keep-up' advanced pursuit laps
and finally five 'shake-your-thang'
laps where you go mad, botch
everything and fall off. Somehow
PJ kept getting lost which is strange
since there are no turn-offs on a
race track. Coming into the hairpin
we would always slow down to
regroup and thus we never really
got much of a shot at the hairpin.
As soon as I was given the go-
ahead to go-it-alone I got scared
silly because there's an empty track
in front of me and no clues as to the
braking points anymore. The
hairpin is usually the slowest bit of
the circuit where lots of people
congregate to watch - but not for
me, because I came in unsighted,
hitting 12,000 revs in third. I hit the
brakes, locked the front, back and
buttocks, piled my crotch into the
fuel tank (ouch), left a 40 metre skid
mark down the track and
underpants, stopped just before hay
bales and managed to peel round the
corner much embarrassed but
without the need to trundle back.
Another 4 laps of screwed lines and
stuffed corners followed until we
were called in for the half way
debrief.
Once out on the track again, all
rational thought goes A W O L as
soon as a member of the other
group is spotted ahead. Overtaking
is simply not permitted; but
catching up and looking smug is
fine! I screwed up a corner horribly
and let him grab a few metres back,
but as soon as I was getting close
Simon, the instructor, casually
sailed past and called the guy to one
side letting us pass him. How did
he do that? The instructors are on
exactly the same machinery as us
(except that they have mirrors) but
can pass any one of us with
consummate ease at any point on
the circuit. It's a depressing world.
During debriefing we were told
that Akio and myself had bags of
aggression but we needed more
work on our lines (no -1 don't know
what they are either -Ed) and Mad
Colin was far too much of a lunatic
and might once or twice have hit the
right line. Mad Colin (aka Schizo
Scholey) is indeed quite insane. As
evidence for this - note how high the
footpegs are on a VFR400R (see
picture). Then be flabbergasted at
the fact he was scraping them in
corners. But all in all, we three
were all pretty close to each other
in terms of lap speeds. We were,
Simon said, pretty typical of the
young blokes they get there - the
older chaps are good on lines but
ride very timidly.
I read in M C N recently that
Yamaha are starting a race school
at Donnington with Rob McElnea,
but it costs £ 1 5 0 whilst ours cost
about £45 plus travel expenses
because it was a club thing.
Imperial College Union Sporting
Motorcycle Club meets on
Wednesday lunchtimes at Southside
upper lounge. Anyone interested in
bikes, whether they have one or
not, is welcome to join us. We help
bikers (or wannabe bikers) with
training and have sociable pub runs
too when we don't have exams. We
are lovely people, and not all of us
are hairy. Next big event is the
Treasure-Hunt Tear Around!
Biking at Cadwell
This article was heavily edited due
to its idiosyncratic use of syntax and
unusual lack of meaning.
Nonetheless, my appreciation goes
to the ICU Motorbike club for
bothering to write, something many
clubs do not, though they should to
advertise their presence. But it
would be a good idea if the authors
of these articles would bear in mind
that Felix is read by people who do
not necessarily understand the
jargon used in their particular
activity. Blow-by- blow accounts
may be of interest to the author, but
they are so boring as to be totally
unreadable to others. Articles
should have a clear purpose - who
wrote it; who are the people
involved - we don't all know who
the nicknames refer to; what club
did whatever the article is about;
where they went and what it is they
went there to do and who to contact
if the reader is interested in joining.
The use of slang and conversational
English should be used sparingly as
it is extremely difficult to read. I
suggest that such authors should let
somebody outside their immediate
circle proof their articles before
submission, because when I do it,
it has to be quick and brutal -
