Elections ratification at motionless EGM
Imperial College Union is to hold
another E G M (Extraordinary
General Meeting) next Thursday al
1.00pm in the Junior Common
Room (JCR). This is the E G M that
was adjourned from the 7th May.
ICU Honorary Secretary, Steve
Farrant, assured Imperial College
News Network (/CNN) that an
amplification system would be in
use for this meeting.
The deadline for motions was
12.30pm yesterday and no motions
were submitted. ICU Third World
First, who had originally submitted
four motions, have now withdrawn
all of them. The main business will
be elections to the posts of House
Committee Chairman, Publicity
Officer, Academic Affairs Officer,
Post Graduate Affairs Officer and
Transport Officer.
The ratification of the recent
elections for departmental
representatives will also be voted on
at the E G M . The election of
departmental representatives (dep
reps) is covered by the Union
constitution as detailed in the 'Blue
Book'. As well as their role in the
Constituent College Unions
Imperial College Management
School has announced that four
scholarship places are to be made
available to full time members of
College staff and their children. The
scholarships will be valid for the
Master of Business Administration
(MBA) degree from the beginning
of the academic year 1992/3.
Both M B A courses are covered
by the scholarships, which will be
awarded on the basis of the
Management School's selection
process. Only those already
accepted for the courses will be
considered for award of the
scholarships. Applications for the
full time course, which begins in
October, must be made by July.
Imperial College Union 'Pimlico
Connection' has been in the public
eye this week following the
publication of three articles in
leading journals. Chris Riley, an ex-
Pimlico tutor and IC PhD student,
writes in New Scientist that the
Pimlico Connection is designed to
promote science and technology and
to increase the staying-on rates for
students of further and higher
education. However, in Institute of
Electrical Engineers (IEE) News,
Mr John Hughes, BP Fellow for
(CCUs), dep reps are eligible to
vote on ICU Council. According to
Zoe Hellinger, IC Union President,
ICU regards the dep reps as their
'most representative' officials and
she added that ICU does not make
enough use of them.
The constitution states that
election papers for dep rep elections
must be posted around the
respective department for fifteen
days, and that nominations must
remain open for ten days. Each
nomination for dep rep requires one
proposer and ten seconders, except
in the case of the Management
school, where only five seconders
are required. If no candidate is
nominated for a post after this time,
then papers should remain up until
nominations are received.
The elections for the dep rep
positions should be held in the
Spring Term, the constitution reads.
The only exception to this is the
Management School, where the
Dep Rep is elected during the first
four weeks of the Autumn Term.
The ballot should be open from
10.00am to 5.00pm on one college
day. Where there is only one
Applications must be received by
September for the part time course,
beginning in December. Further
information on the courses can be
obtained from the Admissions
Office in the Registry Division,
Sherfield 327, or from Kim Everitt,
extension 3318.
The announcement of the
scholarships follows a difference of
opinion between college
management and Imperial College
Association of University Teachers
( I C A U T ) on the award of
scholarships. At the start of 1991,
the Management School announced
that it was withdrawing free places
for College staff studying on the
part time M B A course. At this time,
Student Tutoring, writes that the
tutoring scheme has now branched
out into English, modern languages
and humanities.
Student tutoring began at Imperial
in 1975, and last year 130 students
volunteered to go out on
Wednesday afternoon into local
secondary and primary schools.
Writing in the National Association
of Teachers in Further and Higher
Education (NATFHE) Journal, Mr
Hughes, says that 97% of students
in the Pimlico scheme feel they get
nomination, that candidate should
be deemed elected after the close of
nominations. I C U Returning
Officer, Steve Farrant, told / C N N
that objections can be lodged to a
specific ratification at the E G M on
Thursday. In this case, an election
could be re-run.
The query on the constitutional
position follows muted concern at
the running of dep rep elections in
the Department of Computing
(DOC). As the current dep rep is
on industrial leave, one of the
candidates approached I C U
President, Zoe Hellinger, to
organise the election, and presented
her with a list of candidates. This
was passed on to City and Guilds
C C U President, Tim Proctor, and
the election was held as for a C C U
post. Both Ms- Hellinger and M r
Proctor were unaware that the
elections for dep rep were covered
by the ICU Constitution. There
were five candidates for D O C dep
rep; Samir Karia, Nainish Batna,
David Cohen, James Grinter and
New Election. Samir Karia was
elected D O C dep rep on the third
count.
the A U T assumed that this
withdrawal of free places would
also cover staff children on the full
time course, though this was not
discussed until September 1991.
The A U T , in a confidential report
leaked to Felix, said that they would
be in favour of 'a scheme of four
free places for staff and none for
children of staff. On 19 September,
the college Management Planning
Group decided to offer three free
staff places and one free place for
a staff child. This week's
announcement now makes no
distinction between staff and staff
children for the four places, except
that staff will be given priority.
useful practice in communicating
scientific ideas, and 90% feel they
are doing something useful with
their subject. Speaking to / C N N ,
Mr Hughes added that BP have
been joined by British Telecom,
National Power, Royal Mail and the
National Westminster Bank in
conjunction with the Lord Mayor's
Appeal, coordinated by the charity
'Community Service Volunteers'
(CSV). He hopes that this support
will lead to further expansion of the
scheme.

Half Million
Jubilation
The Chemical Engineering
Department has announced that its
Jubilee Appeal has reached the half
million pound mark. The appeal
was launched last year to
commemorate the 50th anniversary
of the Chemical Engineering
degree, and is intended to improve
undergraduate facilities in the
department.
The appeal has been marketed by
a group of seven students within the
department. After approaching
undergraduate students for
contributions, they then raised
£100,000 from alumni. A further
£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 was collected from
industry.
The appeal was supervised by
Professor Lester Kershenbaum,
who conducts applied catalysis and
reaction engineering research. He
said that 'the benefit for students
and the Department have been
greater than we envisaged.'
Time Out
Louise van der Straeten, IC Union
Finance Manager, has announced
that she will be absent on study
leave from Thursday 26th May to
Friday 12th June inclusive. Ms van
der Straeten told / C N N that urgent
financial work should be brought to
her attention today. Any work after
this would be looked after by
Mandy Hurford, IC Union
Manager, or Zona O'Sullivan,
Assistant Finance Manager. IC
