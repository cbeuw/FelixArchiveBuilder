The Man With The Ten Bob Note
A story by Buz Barstow
A solitary death is so unkind to us
all. It leaves us in that instant of
indignity where all that there can
be are preconceptions about what
we did, where we came from, all
based on what remains with us,
when we were in no state of mind
to choose wisely.
)ust, then imagine, what it is like
for those with no means of prepara-
tion, living each day as it comes,
with no desire but for the end, but
no idea about how to meet it. Stuck
in the singularity between action
and indecision.
So, when you're found dead in a
park. Your death bed was made of
roses, your funeral gown a long,
coarse coat, shoes battered beyond
repair, days of growth on your beard
and an Eisenhower cap, the indigni-
ty must be hard to bear, but I sup-
pose no harder than the pity heaped
upon you everyday. You're lucky
you're dead.
The impression you leave on the
universe in the instant of death, is
for a tramp, the most important
one, and almost uncertainly, the
most unfavourable. Everything you
ever amounted to during your life,
everything you achieved is erased,
never really was, as without identifi-
cation, your life lacks closure. You
cannot be remembered for what you
did, as no one knows you need to
be remembered. All the closure you
will receive is the impression your
body, your clothing and the means
of your death gives of you.
The clues are limitless, if only
you have the eyes to look. The silver
ring, shining in the light of the sun
against the mans darkened hands.
Still, no, moving, why is it moving?
Tumbling against the blackness,
more of them, ten, a hundred, a
thousand, so many that they begin
to bring meaning to the blackness.
But still moving, the original had
long since passed out of view. Yet
they continued falling. Out in front
of the blackness was an impression,
lines of a face, the tramps face, but
younger, the features were stronger,
eyes filled with brightness. Now it all
begins to become clear who the
man was. He was out amongst the
stars.
The man lifted himself off his
knees. The stars never lost their
wonder did they? However much
time you spent out in their realm.
Like so many onboard, the man was
born on a planetary body. Some
said that even being born in space
didn't diminish the wonder of the
stars. The wonder of the stars,
despite their brilliance, wasn't the
mans main concern, more one in
particular, or to be precise, a planet
surrounding it.
The star system that his starship
orbited so carefully, was a dual sys-
tem, composed of a black hole,
orbited by a red giant about which
orbited what remained of the plan-
ets it had ravaged by the expansion
of its atmosphere.
As the red giant orbited the
black hole, it gradually spiralled ever
closer, and one day it would enter
the black hole, and, for all intents
and purposes leave our universe,
but long before that day, tidal forces
exerted on the star and planets by
the black hole would reduce them to
a platter of rubble and plasma. That
day was coming sooner than anyone
liked. One of the remaining gas
giants in the system held a moon in
its a grip, on which remained a small
outpost of the empire. Don't worry,
nobody was still on it, but there was
some house keeping that still need-
ed to be done. If the empire was
anything, it was fastidious. No stone
unturned, no file out of place, no
loose ends. What the housekeeping
entailed, the man didn't know. He'd
be leaving soon, and in 4 days,
when he arrived, he'd be briefed.
The sky cracked. Its naked wonder
was a rediscovered experience for
anyone so removed from the organ-
ic world. The rain too, whatever it
may be made of; ammonia, sul-
phuric acid, even water, falling on
the roof was something you were
never able to appreciate in a life in
space. There was something about
that irregular crackling that was
uniquely soothing.
Inside what remained of the
outpost, the man could taste the
sophistication of the outpost. The
air was wonderfully moist, but crisp
at the same time, like tasty fruit, or
an elegant wine, two more delica-
cies the man hadn't relished in
some time. You'd be surprised what
effect deprivation had on the soul.
The air recyclers, particularly expen-
sive ones from the taste of the air,
were still turned on. The subtle light-
ing also worked. Another rarity in
space.
The map of the outpost he'd
been given was difficult to follow. It
was flat. For someone who'd been
used to walking around curved tun-
nels and slipping between variable
gravity sections, it was more than
just an interesting challenge, it was
like being in the hands of something
you didn't quite know or under-
stand.
His full briefing hadn't yet
arrived, it was supposed to be wait-
ing for him, but waiting where? The
outposts lounge area was to his
right, the kitchen to the left. He took
the right hand door. All the doors
here swung open by hand, another
luxurious waste of space. Having to
take the effort to open every door
was a little trying as well.
He entered the lounge area. The
light from the corridor illuminated a
form on the floor. It had a lumines-
cent quality all of its own though, if
anything diminished by the light
from the corridor. He groped for a
light switch around the door. The
wall lights of the room slowly lit, giv-
ing him range of the room, to get to
the figure on the floor.
The figure was a young woman,
who had collapsed on one of the
glass coffee tables that dotted the
room. Must have collapsed in one
of the last earthquakes and been
knocked unconscious by the fall.
How long had she been like this?
More importantly, why was she still
here? These were two questions
that he'd have to put to the back of
his mind until he arrived at the
mothership. But there lay the prob-
lem. The pod he'd used to get here
only had enough supplies to take
one back to the mothership.
The man carried the woman to
one of the plush red sofas that too
encircled the room, and took a seat
himself. He'd need to sit down to
make a decision like this. Hell, he'd
need more than that. Leave the
woman and save himself, no one
would notice. Do the honourable
thing and sacrifice himself when the
moon collapsed under the black
holes gravitational influence. Or, do
the smart thing and take the time to
convert the pod to two man travel.
He'd have a couple of days at most
before the gas giants orbit took it
within an unsafe distance of the
black hole, then the moons struc-
ture really would be tested. It would
almost undoubtedly fail.
Communications with the moth-
ership were out of the question. The
black hole not only screwed up
faster than light communications by
placing an unpassable wall in hyper-
space, but also made conventional
radio transmissions impossible.
The moon rocked again. Tidal
forces from the black hole were
needing the core of the moon like a
baker would do to a piece of dough.
At least the end would come soon.
He took the woman out through the
umbilical walkway to the pod on the
outposts landing pad. He told the
onboard computer to carry out the
return flightpath that it had been
given at the mothership to allow it
to avoid the black hole's event hori-
zon. Out of a sense of eternal opti-
mism, he took his EVA suit out of
the back of the pod, just in case he
could be rescued, and retreated
back into the outpost, where he
commanded the pod to leave the
moon and carry out its orders.
He went back to the lounge,
poured himself a selection of what
remained of the drinks cabinet and
started to wait. Pretty expensive
too. Perhaps this was the house-
keeping that needed to be done.
The first full day of his incarcer-
ation on the moon came, and like
any man awaiting doom, wasted it,
while simultaneously trying to eke
out every pleasurable moment. He
took little time to appreciate the
strange ornaments that adorned the
building, nor took any to look into
his "housekeeping".
Finally, came the end. A long
time ago, people would have called
this the apocalypse, with no space
to run to, this really would be the
end for them. The man had given up
his chance to run like a fallen angel.
The ground outside started to rip
apart, like most tomes of death said
it would. The outpost would be hit
soon. He donned his EVA suit, like
any good explorer would, in the vain
hope that he might be rescued at
the last minute, and began to wait
anew. The outpost was shuddering.
The best thing to do would be to
find some high ground, above any
falling rocks. He climbed to the
highest peak available, a laughably
small elevation, and began to survey
the destruction. The outpost was
still there, barely. He took the time,
like he always did when nervous.
The sky cracked again. The last thing
he remembered was falling.
To be continued...
