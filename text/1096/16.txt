or a romantic comedy to stick
out from the crowd these
days, it must be either incred-
ibly romantic or extremely funny.
Unfortunately, Fools Rush In is nei-
ther. It stars Matthew Perry
(Chandler form Friends to everyone
in the entire universe except
unicellular organisms from Saturn)
as Alex, a pragmatic corporate type
from New York, who meets, and
beds, Isabel (Salma Hayek). Isabel
escapes in the night to avoid the
morning after, only to discover that
she is pregnant. She turns up three
months later to tell Alex the news,
whereupon they fall in love and are
married by an Elvis impersonator in
Las Vegas. And then the film really
gets started.
Running against type for a
romantic comedy (two ill-suited
people hate each other, are thrown
together by all manner of ridiculous
coincidences, and finally fall
miraculously in love in the last ten
minutes) by having the two ill-
LA CONFIDENTIAL
Starring: Kevin Spacey, Guy
Pearce, Danny DeVito
Director: Curtis Hanson
S
et in 1950s Los Angeles, the
film is based around the city's
notoriously corrupt police
force. Guy Pearce (former drag
queen in Priscilla Queen of the
Desert, otherwise known as Mike
from Neighbours) is Officer Exley, a
naive misfit who is unafraid of
snitching on his colleagues for
- beating up innocent immigrants on
Christmas Eve. In contrast, one of
Exley's contemporaries, Bud
White, is an impulsive, fiery and
violent cop who uses brawn to
settle his arguments and was one
of the offending cops. However,
White has a soft spot for protecting
women and runs to the aid of every
damsel who appears to be in dis-
tress, including Kim Basinger. She
plays one of the local upper-class
prostitutes who undergo surgery to
resemble film stars for the pleasure
of their clients. After the murder of
White's partner, Exley is
put second in command of an
investigation which unfolds more
suited people fall in love at the
start, there is the hope that we are
seeing something different. This is,
unfortunately, not to be. The
incidents that are supposed to
cause conflict seem weak and
contrived, never making us doubt
that they are going to live happily
police corruption than he had
previously thought imaginable.
The film is slightly slow to begin
with an uninteresting narrative by
Danny DeVito but the plot soon
thickens, albeit in an unsurprising
"good cop-bad cop" direction.
The acting is first-rate, especially
Kevin Spacey's celebrity detective
who thrives on appearing on front
pages. Guy Pearce is also more
than up to holding his own in such
distinguished company. The story-
line is seamless and the scenes
well sequenced, nudging the
absorbed viewer toward the con-
clusion without valuable brain-
power being consumed. The whole
film has a comic book feel to it
while at the same time managing
to be complex enough to have
several themes running through it
simultaneously.
The only qualms about all this is
the slightly dubious moral at the
end, which sees the idealistic Exley
swinging his fists along with the
violent colleagues he had
previously despised. Nevertheless,
this is an an entertaining and stylish
film that is well worth the entrance
fee. â€¢

ever after. Perry plays Alex as a
watered-down Chandler, but still
manages to get most of the funny
lines. Salma Hayek effortlessly
plays herself as the feisty Mexican
whose belief in destiny fuels the
conflicts. However, these other-
wise very likable leads do not

provide the necessary sparks and,
with a denouement that can be
deduced from the fact that Isabel is
pregnant at the start of the film,
this is another film to be filed under
"could do better." 13

FATHER TED - THE SECOND SERMON
As you must surely know, Father Ted is an original
comedy from Channel 4 which revolves around the
misadventures of three misfit Irish priests, set in a tiny
village on the remote Craggy Island. It is utterly hilarious
and very reminiscent of The Young Ones. This video
contains the best ever Father Ted episode, "Tentacles
of Doom" in which three bishops come to stay. The
result is death, a religious conversion and a painful
experience with the island's newly-upgraded holy
stone. D

THE VERY BEST OF MEN BEHAVING BADLY
The two loveable rogues are available to own in this
premium edition of their best episodes. Unlike so
many videos of TV programmes this is excellent value,
running for well over two hours and featuring the
hilarious Stag Night, which has never previously been
available to buy. The collection also includes Gary and
Tony, the first ever episode in which Gary ploughs
through a host of weirdos before discovering the
perfect housemate in Gary. This is a must for any fans
of the kebab-eating boys. D
