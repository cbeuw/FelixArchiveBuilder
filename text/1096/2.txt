Meningitis Monster Strikes Again
Once again, the new university
year has been greeted with out-
breaks of deadly meningitis
appearing in student halls of res-
idence.
Last year, three students from
the University of Cardiff died from
the disease during the first term.
Controversy surrounded the out-
break, as official guidelines sug-
gested that cases more than four
weeks apart were unconnected.
Since the first two cases were four
weeks and one day apart, the
health authorities responsible
treated them as isolated incidents.
It was only later, after more cases
were identified, and another stu-
dent had died, that the cases were
found to have a common link. The
guidelines have since been
changed.
This year has already seen two
new cases of meningitis in Cardiff,
and the university and health
authorities moved quickly to dis-
tribute information about the
linkes, and antibiotics have been
given to those close to the two
men involved.
Meningitis comes in two main
forms, bacterial and viral. The bac-
terial form is much rarer, and is
more severe. However, the form
that surfaced this year in Cardiff is
not as virulent as last year's.

Conference Centre
Goes from Strength to
Strength
The latest, unaudited, figures
recently presented in a
Managment and Planning Group
(MPG) report show the
Conference Centre making a heavy
loss in 1996-97 for the third year
running. The year finished with a
net deficit of over £40,000 (see
graph).
The centre has already been
under the spotlight for failing to
profit from the Fashion Week deal
(Felix 1094) and a huge overspend
on furniture and office develop-
ment (Felix 1095).
Staff costs appear to be the
main financial drain on the centre,
representing 56% of total sales in
1995-96. Felix has also heard that
summer accommodation was let
out this year in block-bookings for
as little as £ 10 per night per room.
This lead to one Language School
sub-letting the rooms to other
companies, which is forbidden.
It is believed that the
Conference Centre are facing an
internal audit to investigate its pro-
ceedures and poor performance.

*Figure not yet audited. All other figures from annual finacnial statements
more dangerous form, though, and
this has led to the death of two stu-
dents, with two more infected.
None have been named, but are
thought to be 19 year old first
years living in the same hall of res-
idence, though they are studying
different subjects. More than 1,000
students will be treated with antibi-
otics as a precautionary measure.
In an unrelated case, a third stu-
dent has also been killed at
Leicester University.
Meningitis is preventable and
curable if detected early enough,
but the disease can progress to an
advanced stage in a matter of
hours. It disease is spread by
germs passing from the nose and
mouth, by kissing, sneezing, or
other transfer of fluids. Freshers are
especially susceptible, as they are
away from home, and so
encounter germs that they have
not come into contact with before.
This mingled with the traditional
student life means that the inci-
dence of meningitis in halls of resi-
dence is three times that of the rest
of the population.
No student is known to have
had meningitis at Imperial.
Students are advised to watch the
health of those around them,
though, and to be aware of the
symptoms, which initially resemble
'flu, followed by fever, a stiff neck,
severe headache, dislike of bright
lights, vomiting, drowsiness, or
even coma. A rash can also be pre-
sent in advanced cases, due to sep-
ticemia, - poisoning of the blood by
the bacteria. Should you or a friend
begin to suffer flu-like symptoms,
Ancillia Whittingdale, a practice
nurse at the IC Health Centre advis-
es that students try traditional
treatments such as paracetamol or
aspirin, and to tell a friend to keep
an eye on them. If symptoms
become worse, to see a doctor or
nurse. The heath centre runs open
clinics every morning, which do not
require an appointment. She also
stressed that any appearance of a
rash, that starts looking like "pin
pricks under the skin" and progress-
es to look like a bruise and does not
disappear with pressure can be an
indication of very advanced menin-
gitis. Medical help should be
sought immediately.
