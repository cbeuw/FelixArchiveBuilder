DESPITE ASSURANCES, BLUNKETT'S
NEW FEES ARE PUTTING OFF THOU-
SANDS O F PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
The Government's proposal to
introduce tuition fees has caused
more controversy this week when
UCAS disclosed that application
figures for the coming year had
dropped by eleven percent. This
puts into question the claim by the
Government that the new student
tuition fees and the abolition of the
grant will not deter students from
entering higher education.
The deadline for Oxbridge
applications - the first indication of
university application rates -
dropped from
44,200
39,369, bucking
the upward
trend of the pre-
vious five years.
UCAS comment-
ed that there
may be 80,000
fewer applicants
if the trend con-
tinues. This
could mean
severe recruit-
ment and fund-
ing problems,
especially for the
newer and smaller universities,
who are already having to cut
courses to make up the shortfall.
Vice-Chancellors are worried that
confusion caused by the
Government over the summer and
their faulty leaflet on fees was con-
tributing to the bewilderment that
many potential students are expe-
riencing.
The Government denied that
this was a problem, saying that the
introduction of fees didn't have any
effect on financially needy stu-
dents, since they would not be
asked to pay tuition fees.
Education and Employment
Secretary David Blunkett said that
he would still monitor the figures to
identify reasons for the alarming
drop in applications, saying "we
need to know whether it is poor
aspirations or fear of debt that
deters people from lower socio-
economic classes from applying to
university." Such students applying
to London for a four year course
could find themselves Â£20,000 in
debt on gradua-

P r e s i d e n t
Douglas Trainer
said that he saw
the drop as proof
that tuition fees
and zero mainte-
nance would
deter students.

promising NUS
policy by agreeing to negotiate
with the Government on the fees
issue. "We are disgusted and
appalled at the lack of action from
the NUS leadership with regards to
tuition fees. They have sold out
students in the future", a Leeds
Union Officer was quoted as say-
ing. A number of NUS unions
intend to call an emergency meet-
ing to oust the leadership, includ-
ing Trainer.
Hamish Common
Big Brother is
Watching You, Wilson
Security in Wilson House is
expected to improve after the
recent installation of a new swipe
card entry system and several
CCTV cameras around the site.
Following the introduction of
the new system, only residents of
the hall can use their swipe card to
enter through the front door.
Visitors are required to press a
buzzer to gain access from the
porter.
In order to allow the porter to
also keep an eye on users of the
sports hall, which shares the back
entrance with Wilson House, the
lodge has now been relocated to
the back of the foyer. Removal of
the old lodge should be completed
by Christmas.
The most significant feature of
the new setup, technically termed
the digital video storage and trans-
mission system (DVST), is that the
CCTVs would be linked to the secu-
rity unit in Sherfield Building. This
would provide the much needed
"Big Brother Watch" after the porter
has gone off duty. The cameras can
also alert the porter to incidents
which take place at other parts of
the building outside the porter's
view.
Previously, residents had to
insert a metal security tag into a
slot in order to open the front
door. When asked how the new
swipe card improves from the old
practice, Derrick Victor, residence
building manager, cited its flexibili-
ty in allowing temporary access to
the house to selected people under
special circumstances. Moreover, it
is his long term aim to extend the
swipe card entry system to cover
every single room in the hall of res-
idence. Such a scheme is currently
under trial in Beit Hall. As a result
of two recent incidences where
people broke through the windows
to gain access into students'
rooms, the possibility of fixing bars
outside the windows of the base-
ment rooms was also discussed.
However, the proposal was likely
to be opposed by fire safety offi-
cers.
