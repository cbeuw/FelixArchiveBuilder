MOUNT DRAGON

BOOKS AND THOUGHT FOR THE DAY 23
No, we don't know what it is
either.
T
his novel is the latest in a
long line of "medical
thrillers" based on the ideas
of genetic engineering and the fear
of going too far in pursuit of scien-
tific goals. Guy Carson is a scientist
working for the Genedyne corpora-
tion, a world leader in biotechnolo-
gy. The story is predominantly set
at the Mount Dragon complex, a
high research base in the desert
and site of Genedyne's most ambi-
tious genetic engineering project.
When Guy Carson is transferred to
work at Mount Dragon he is deter-
mined to succeed in his task but
the efficiency of the Mount Dragon
complex is about to disintegrate as
some disturbing facts are revealed.
The ethics of genetic engineering
are raised early in the story with the
two opposing viewpoints material-
ising in the form of two main char-
acters. These moral viewpoints are
handled well as the reader can
appreciate the possible dangers
and benefits of Genedyne's
research. Preston doesn't pressur-
ize the reader into taking sides but
skillfully reveals more information
as the novel progresses. The story
skips between locations as it fol-
lows the progress of different char-
acters and this can often be con-
fusing but it does help to maintain
the suspense of the novel especial-
ly as the plot develops. Irrelevent
descriptive passages detract from
the story from the story in some
areas and the overuse of scientific
detail only serves to confuse when
used inappropriately. The conclu-
sion to this story is stretched out
for too long as the ending becomes
obvious long before it materializes.
Preston attempts to involve a little
romance towards the end but this
is handled poorly as if it was
thrown in because the main char-
acters had nothing else to do! A
few loose ends need firmly knot-
ting together at the end. This novel
contributes some interesting points
to the genetic engineering debate
and does well in exploring the rea-
soning behind each characters
beliefs. Michael Critcheon, this is
not, but if you enjoy scientific
thrillers it might be worth a try.

Thought for the day
No.3: The Internet
W
hat is the official title of
this university? "Imperial
College of Science,
Technology and Medicine"?
Surprisingly enough, this is not the
case. It actually reads more like
this: "Imperial College of Science,
Technology, Medicine and
Internet-Worship".
Call me a cynic, but many students
at this establishment even use the
'net to move the corpuscles around
their blood stream.
If you will pardon the blasphemy
and general heresy, it's pathetic.
The worst part is that the internet is
not even any good. Many of you
now will be getting out your silicon
shrines to pray to the God of data
packet collision, in the hope that he
will strike me down with ones and
zeros, but the truth is that I am
right. The internet is appalling, and
getting worse all the time.
The sociologists may salivate over
the concept. "Ooh," they say, "it's
so exciting. The first time in history
that a completely unregulated
medium of communication has
existed, and our generation is
blessed with being able to study it."
Oh, marvellous. It is nothing but an
excuse for Teletubby-obsessed
dope-smoking Sociology students
to submit bizarre constructional
techniques to "Andy and Barry's
Let's Make a Bong Out of It" page.
Or I might cite the somewhat over-
used example of the nerdy speccy
acne-faced geek staring at a fresh-
ly-downloaded image of breasts at
1024 by 768 pixels in 16.7 million
colours. Sadly, they will only ever
be in two dimensions.
The humble web was originally con-
ceived by the military. Tragically,
the original protocols are now real-
ly not designed for the plethora of
traffic, most of it completely point-
less, that trickles its way around the
lethargic data paths. It is a principle
of physics that when light travels
through a fibre-optic cable, it slows
down. The Net-surfer would be for-
given for concluding that it slows
down a lot. One hell of a lot, judg-
ing by the modern download
speeds, where comparatively slow
home modems are kept waiting for
the data from supposedly much
faster links.
It is not even a challenging pursuit
any more. In the good old days of
8-bit micros, you needed a com-
puting degree to operate a modem
and log on at 2400 baud to a
dodgy Prestel teletext service.
These days, you can walk into a
cafe anywhere in the country and
off you go. Nothing is wonderful
any more.
Well, I'll let you get back to your
