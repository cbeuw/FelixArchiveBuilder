Rugby rucks and rolls
ICRFC I v Q M W I
In a dynamic, fast-moving game,
the firsts triumphed on
Wednesday with a cohesive and
impressive performance. In one of
the first moves of the game, Rich
"Mongol" Lloyd burst through the
Q M W defence to score a try which
motivated the team for the rest of
the first half. The main fault in the
performance was a shortage in
line-out possession but good
interplay and support in midfield
made up for that. An excellent
individual effort led to a try from
winger Jim "Squeaky" Sopper (Man
of the match).
In the second half, after a short
period when the team composed
themselves, more fluid rugby fol-
lowed. Tries from Martyn "Buffy"
Buttenshaw and David "Nipply"
Pearce boosted the score along
with kicks from Alistair "Fich"
Jeffrey (outside half) and Dave
"Anal" Gol.
The scoreline was impressive and
the team had to work hard for
every point in a well-deserved win.

ICRFC II v Q M W II
A victorious team departed from
'The Bull' at Thedon Bois after
beating Q M W 36-0. The bus didn't
arrive so a demoralised team had
to take the long tube journey to
Thedon Bois.
Arriving 20 minutes before kick
off we changed and warmed up
quickly. Initially play was loose
after our late arrival. However with
forwards getting well together,
being our second match, we soon
brought order to the chaos! Some
good work from the backs, after
the forwards had sucked the
opposition in saw some tries going
in on the far corner!
H. Tanner played well after not
being able to see without his con-
tacts and D.Higazi utilised the
loose ball scoring, along with
N.Parker who took the ball from
the back of the opposition pack to
crash over the line.
J.Trude eventually gets a score
which was well deserved and our
glorious captain K.Beattie kicked
well totalling our score at 36
points.

ICHC I v St GEORGE'S ICHC 11 v ST BART'S RSM v ICHC ICVC v LSE
Full of hope, St George's were there,
resplendent in red and white, oblivi-
ous to their impending humiliation.
We started a possession game
and had the opposition in our hands
from the start. Tight play resulted in
a pair of goals from Chicken Bol.
Half-time come quickly for our
dominant team.
And now the Gods struck: not
content with our comfortable domi-
nation, the captain finished his third
hat-trick in three games. 2.4 Inches
missed sitter after sitter while
Heartbreak Boy put two away for
the side. Angel Face, not happpy
with the open geal in front of him,
continued his dribble and found
himself, proverbially, up his own
arse. The day must however go to
the obviouly rich freshers Graime
and Taz for their first IC goals.
A superb result, following the 4-
1 win against King's and hard fought
draw with Royal Free Hospital, this
should be a very successful season
in BUSA for the firsts as we look set
to win our group
ICI 7 - 0 St George's
With an air of confidence IC took
the pitch at Stepny Green. The air
was soon smelling foul as SBLH
pressed home with long periods of
intense pressure. Despite their vig-
orous nipular activity St Barts
couldn't open the beef curtains to
score [What are you talking about?
- naive Si] [Vaginas? - Jake]. IC
responded with some occasional
ripostes and flirts down the wings,
but rarely did they trouble the St
Barts goal.
At half time the score being 0-
0, Rich spiced up his side by
threatening to stop them with his
small knob. This obviously did the
trick as, despite some early frenet-
ic activity around the IC goal, St
Barts were again unable to score.
IC now counter attacked with
verve and vigour leading to a
penalty flick. Opportunity knocked
for Pudding, as he slammed in
theshot. St Barts fell to pieces as
IC poured on relentless pressure.
The result was, to be honest a
jammy escape.
ICHC II 1 - 0 St Bart's I
On Wednesday, the best RSM
team for years faced ICI11. RSM
opened the scoring in the second
half after constant pressure. Tim's
hit at goal and a deflection saw the
ball into the back of the net,
watched by his girlfriend. ICI Us
pulled back with a fine goal ten
minutes later, but RSM then domi-
nated the rest of the game with
two goals - first from Maruf and
then Shiman sealing it with a fine
reverse-stick hit.

ICWHC I v KCL
A good performance against a
renamed side. The scoreline does
not reflect the effort displayed.
Intense hockey resulted in two
injuries. The first a woosie Kings
girl who nearly cracked her skull
open then Hummingbird who fell
over Somebody's shoe! By the end
of the match there were more
ambulances than goals. And then
we beat the boys at singing!
ICWHC I 0 - 0 KCL
After a good season last year for
the men's team, first in the third
division table and qualifying to the
London League Division II, their
start for this season could not be
better, three wins in row.
First match was against LSE in
the BUSA championship, where IC
boys taught the opposition a les-
son on away ground. The next two
matches were in the London
League, against IVA Boustan and
Anatolia VC . IC boys were against
tough opposition but came back to
win both matches after losing the
first set on both occasions.
We have three teams for the
first time: men's, women's and the
mixed team. We train on Fridays
evenings between 6 and 8pm, and
in the first two terms we invite
beginners to join us on
Wednesdays afternoons 3-5pm in
the sports centre. We meet an
hour before training at the cash
machine in the Sherfield Building.
ICVC 3- 0 LSE
ICVC 3 - 1 IVA Boustan
ICVC 3 - 1 Anatolia
