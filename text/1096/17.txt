K E N S I N G T O N
This week we are giving away more merchandise from
the excellent A Life Less Ordinary. It is a bizarre
version of the usual Boy-meets-Girl scenario in which
a pair of angels are sent on a mission to make two
complete opposites attract. Ewan McGregor and
Cameron Diaz are the two victims of fate who are
brought together when he is sacked by her father and
looks for revenge.
This is no normal film, as would be expected from
the people behind Shallow Crave and Trainspotting.
Full of surreal scenes, eccentric characters and
memorable music it is not to be missed.
We have four sets of t-shirts, books and posters
from the film to give to those answering the simple
question below. You know the score by now, just
e-mail us at felix@ic.ac.uk or pop in with the answer:
In which sleepily titled film did Ewan
McGregor reveal all?
The winners of tickets to see A Life Less Ordinary
knew that Cameron Diaz starred with Jim Carey in The
Mask. They are John Rieuwerts, Stephen Tarlton, Bill
Tung and Geng Phan.
The winner of the CD, book and screenplay is G.
Wong, who correctly answered that Diaz starred with
Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding.
