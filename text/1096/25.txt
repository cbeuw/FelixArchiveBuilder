St GEORGE'S v ICFGII ICFC I v UCL I IC IV v UCH
Travelling out into the wilds
beyond zone 6, the seconds were
in bouyant mood even though ace
striker Warren had been stolen by
a mad Norweigan. Our customary
five minutes kip at the start of the
game allowed them to score a
breakaway goal. It soon became
apparent that we were so much
better than them it was funny.
Except they were 1-0 up and we
weren't laughing.
The first half passed with the
defence of Jesse, Loz, Dan and Phil
in total control but with the mid-
field and attack not quite clicking.
A half-time switch of Hajo to mid-
field and Tony to attack unleashed
our awesome power and it was
only a matter of time before we
scored. Felix's shot was wickedly
deflected into their goal and they
knew they weren't going to regain
the lead as Felix grabbed another
and Steve beat the lanky keeper at
the near post to send us into the
next round of the cup.
After the match Martin is
alleged to have left the country
after not scoring for four games.

KING'S IV v ICFC IV
After winning their first league
point on Saturday the fourths
secured their first BUSA point in a
difficult tie and from here we
should go onto qualify for the
national stages in the New Yeaar.
Today we played King's fourths,
nicknamed "The Badgers" for the
third year running. An indication of
their sexual preferences, probably,
but it wasn't enough to deter the
[Master] Baiters from IC.
Despite dominating the early
stages and having the better
chances in the first half, we fell a
goal behind when the ball broke to
Head Badger close in on goal.
Chris "Dones" Donner, following
an almighty scramble, equalised by
mis-hitting a volley towards the
goal and the ball slowly bobbled in.
In the second half, Ryan's free
kick on the right touch-line caught
the nocturnal Goalie-Badger sleep-
ing and hoped over his head from
35 yards. King's mounted an
almighty onslaught and scored
their equaliser wiht only ten min-
utes to go. Superb saves from the
veteran keeper kept us in the
match and the scores ended level.
Kings IV 2 - 2 ICFC IV
Who is Chris Soberg? Psycho?
Duke of Prague? He is, of course,
both. He is also the captain of the
Firsts who went through to the
semi-finals of the ULU Cup on
Saturday.
Injury problems? The Firsts had
quite a few. Jamie Foulstone was
out with a dead leg, forcing Steve
Fleming and Donal Keane to play,
Dave Stewart was struggling with
his knee, Mikael Askerdal wasn't fit
and German Shana was carried off
in the 2nd half. But Richard Pratt
gave the Firsts the lead, only for
UCL to equalise. Worse followed in
extra-time when Keane misjudged
a high ball into the box and UCL
took the lead. Substitute Warren
Tube in his First team debut
equalised with minutes remaining.
So there had to be a penalty
shoot-out. some, like Amo, Psycho
and Ricky Gibson kept their cool,
while Keane and Warren Tube
couldn't handle the pressure. UCL
then missed their 13th penalty in
what appeared to be an endless
story. Psycho stepped up to score
his 2nd penalty of the day.
ICFC 12-2 UCL I
(ICFC win 10 -9 on penalties.)
ICFC V v RSM II
Matches against RSM are always
eventful and today was no excep-
tion. The match began with both
teams applying pressure, but IC
made the first breakthrough when
RSM handballed in the box and
Dan scored the resulting penalty.
Soon after, however, disaster
struck when Nick allegedly kicked
an RSM player in an "off-the-ball"
incident and the ref sent him off. ,
IC battled against an increasingly
overwhelming RSM side but still
managed to increase the lead
when Serge was put through and
finished clinically.
The second half started badly
with RSM scoring in a goalmouth
scramble. IC held on to their lead
until a deflected shot was unforgiv-
ably fumbled by keeper Jimmy. But
our saviour arrived in the shape of
Dimitris, who received the ball from
the centre, shot down the left wing,
burst into the RSM box and rifled
the ball into their net. Solid, gutsy
performances from Malcom and
Kublai in particular helped IC win
the match. Well done to all the IC
players for an exceptional victory.

side able to make any room. Then
Montpelier hit Southwell with a fast
counterattack and as Rashid
flashed the ball across the goal-
mouth it canonned off a defender
to give Montpelier a 1 -0 lead.
Then, against the run of play,
Southwell were awarded a free kick
about twenty yards from the
Montpelier goal and with this, their
only chance of the half, scored a
cross into the top corner of the
net. Chances went begging until
five minutes from time Mark
Yellowneck latched on to a free
kick from the left and scored
Montpelier's fourth.
Overall, Montpelier were more
than worth their four goals and
Southwell were lucky with one!
Montpelier 4-1 Southwell
