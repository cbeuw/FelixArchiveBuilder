STAR WARS -
REBEL ASSAULT II
LucasArts
F
ollowing the technically
superb and long awaited X-
Wing Versus Tie Fighter and
Jedi Knight, Lucas Arts have finally
released Rebel Assault II as part of
the White Label budget range.
Whilst the two years since its
release have seen great leaps in
graphics and sound, RAI1 can most
definitely hold its head above
water. It is, as the blurb suggests,
exactly like being in a Star Wars
movie, with well directed FMV and
spectacular 3D animation cut-
scenes, merging tightly with the
action.
You are the rebel Rookie One,
and as always, it is down to you to
stop the Empire from destroying
the Rebels, uncover their new
secret weapon, etc. The story is
well put together and has a few
moments of real Lucas magic. A
healthy sense of sanitised but well
observed humour keeps the spirit
of Star Wars going, and it feels like
a real page turner. Unfortunately,
the pages are the levels and the
levels do not change a great deal.
Space battles take place in a heavy
handed walk through fashion, and
you are clawing at the joystick for a
bit of freedom. Ground combat is
similarly limited, although you are
31 October 1997
able to dive in and out of cover in
addition to aiming and firing at the
incredibly stupid stormtroopers.
The behind-the-ship perspective,
used for flying down mineshafts,
through trees on speeder bikes and
through canyons on training mis-
sions is just a little too jerky. To be
fair, Lucas Arts have dressed each
level up very nicely, and at first you
don't notice how simplistic every-
thing is, but after an hour or so of
play you just want to get on to the
next bit of plot, and the gameplay
becomes a hindrance.
Once the game has been com-
pleted, there is no incentive to
return, and the lack of network
options will soon consign this to
the back of the drawer. All that
said, it is a very slick, well made
and absorbing game, which, if
you've not seen before, is well
worth a look at budget price. You
may do better merely to borrow a
copy for the evening though. H

A
t last! Something more to do with cars other than racing them
around and around in over-elaborate circles... Prepare to experi-
ence first-hand every car chase you have ever seen on the small
or silver screen. Drive inconsiderately, run red lights, park illegally and -
tsk - break the speed limit. Take control of dozens of different vehicles,
from the mundane to the meaty, each with distinctive handling and its
own radio and horn for noise noise noise, boys.
Three vast and very different 'living' city networks are waiting to be
explored - and exploited. Speed recklessly down the main streets, free-
ways, alleyways, back streets and pavements, through parks and shop-
ping malls (and pedestrians if need be) to reach your destination - or
escape the long arm of the law.
Race, chase, skid and wheelspin; burn that rubber; smash, bash, crash
and trash those cars;
bump and jump; break
through roadblocks;
rack up the bodycount
- - and your score, for
the only way to beat
the law is to drive with-
out due care and
attention (bribery can
help, but the price is
high). Crime does pay -
but only when it's pre-
tend.
Released for
Playstation and PC on
21 November £44.99.
