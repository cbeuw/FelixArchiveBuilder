A Plea From R A G
We urgently need people to do our tra-
ditional SNKPJ (Sponsored Nude
Kamikaze Parachute Jump). We cur-
rently have no one, and it is not unusu-
al for the participants to raise a lot of
money for our charities from sponsors.
The SNKPJ involves running from
Harrods to Beit Quad (with an optional
lap of the Albert Hall singing "Rule
Brittania") completely naked. This year
there's also a prize for the first one back
who does the extra lap!
Contact RAG via extension 58099 or
email rag@ic. We also hold regular
meeting every Thursday on the stage in
dBs.

Netball Team
Interested in playing netball? The
club is restarting. Email a.osei@ic
Calling all ladies who can play
hockey (any standard). If you
fancy playing for IC on
Wednesdays or Saturdays.
Contact d.perry@ic or turn up for
training, 6pm Mondays at the
Union.
No body's complained to us this
week, but that's not to say we
didn't do anything wrong. If
you've spotted a mistake or have
a bone to pick, get in contact.
Call 58072 or email felix@ic.
