Power-up for IC
Following the latest college strat-
egy plans to reduce heating and
energy bills, Imperial is set to
build its own power station.
The new generator will consist
of two reciprocating gas fired
engines, each with an electrical
output of 3.875 MW. Compared to
the coal fired power station at
Ferrybridge, Yorkshire, which gen-
erates 1,200 MW, this may sound
small, but the new station will be
able to supply the whole of the
main site with most of it's electrici-
ty and heating needs, including hot
water and air conditioning.
The new generator will replace
the current source of energy which
consists of steam imported from
the Natural History Museum, elec-
tricity from the local power board
and electricity generated by a
heavy oil burning power station
which is located under Elec Eng.
The current generator is 30 years
old and reaching the end of its
acceptable lifetime. It is also envi-
ronmentally unfriendly, due to the
heavy oil it burns, "...it's like tar,
you have to heat it to 80°C just to
get it moving", commented
Andrew Thome, responsible for
energy usage across IC.
During periods of peak
demand, top up electricity will be
imported from the grid, and during
times of low demand College will
have the option of selling the
excess to the board or reduce the
generating output - much easier
with gas-powered stations than
with other types.
Work on the refurbishment will
start later this year with the erec-
tion of a temporary generator in
Dalby court while the refurbishment
takes place. The new power station
is then planned to be operational
by Spring/Summer 1999. The cost
of the new power station will be
around £6 million, although the
return on investment should mean
that the savings on electricity alone
repay the investment in ten years.
College has undertaken a num-
ber of energy management initia-
tives over the past few years in
order to reduce usage. The aim is
to cut the current £3 million energy
budget by 30% over five years.

the Chairman of the Governors last Thursday. The enormous cere-
mony took place in the Albert Hall and lasted well over three hours.

Measures include the creation of a
new energy management section
within College, the fitting of energy
efficient light bulbs in all student
bedrooms and new microprocessor
based networks which monitor and
control the operation of ventilation
and heating throughout buildings.
The system, known as BEMS, has
been on trial in the Huxley building
for the last two years and has man-
aged to reduce its monthly heating
demands by a third.
Energy conservation is now of
prime consideration in all new
buildings and refurbishments, and
is being specifically targeted for fur-
ther investment. Money has been
specifically earmarked for investing
in energy efficiency over the com-
ing year and formal systems are
now in place to review the energy
efficiency of the whole College.
