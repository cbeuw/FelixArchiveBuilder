8 COLUMNS 31 October 1997
Well, another group of
inmates successfully
paraded before the
parole board. I refer, of course, to
Commemoration Day, so called,
boys and girls, because it com-
memorates the visit of King
George VI and Queen Elizabeth,
now the Queen Mother, to the
College on the occasion of the one
hundredth anniversary of the foun-
dation of the Royal College of
Chemistry. Though I wasn't there
this year- my invitation from the
Governors must have got lost in
the post- my friends and col-
leagues tell me that it was, as last
year, excellent. Full marks must go
to Vernon McClure and his
Registry staff for a first class event;
not everything conceived within
the corridors of Sherfield is an
unmitigated disaster.
One thing 1 do like to do in this
job from time to time is pick over
the bones of the letters page. Not
usually a place for rich pickings, we
had a few good ones last week.
Firstly, Montpelier Hall. The
natives are restless, since IC plans
to sell their home. Understandable
anxiety, but they themselves have
hit the nail on the head. 'It's [sic]
situation has to be the best of all
Imperial College halls...within
close proximity to the best known
shops in London.' The decision to
sell, raising over Â£5milion, is not
'ineptitude.' It makes no sense, I'm
afraid, for Imperial to hold such
valuable properties as student res-
idences. Last year I suggested that
we lease back all our halls of resi-
dences, thus freeing up huge
amounts of capi-
tal that could be
used for improve-
ment, which
could even make
this conferencing
pipedream feasi-
ble (all right,
that's perhaps
straining creduli-
ty). What is a
shame however,
is that IC does
not have the
m a n a g e m e n t
competence to redevelop
Montpelier in-house, an idea that
could make us an absolute for-
tune.
Something really seems to
have rattled the cage of young Mr
Bio2 (funny surname, Martin).
Though 1 have some sympathy
with the thoughts expressed, most
credibility is lost under a mountain
of ignorance. You missed the key
point. Rules on posters (is this
true?) and suchlike are all made by
students, and that's the frightening
thing. Regular readers will know
that I rarely lock horns with the
Union, because it is not something
about which I know very little. A
word of warning. Never attack ICU
unless you are very sure of your
facts. There are legions of students
out there that
know the
C o n s t i t u t i o n
inside out, and
are not averse to
spouting it at
great length.
Now don't get
me wrong, 1 am
not anti-Union.
Our sabs, by and
large, have done
a very good job
over the last few
' r
years, not least
Eric Allsop, who has presided over
a rather tricky period of office. The
problem lies with some of the
hacks on the various committees,
executives and councils. These
august bodies hold a great fascina-
tion for children who love the
sound of their own voices and like
to play politics, hence some of the
ridiculous rulings that they gener-
ate. This results in good people
being dissuaded from getting
involved in ICU, seeing it, wrongly,
as somewhat of an irrelevance
beyond the provision of 'cheap
beer and curries.'
You would expect the Union to
be very open, but at one of last
year's hustings, someone talked
about the Union's reserves.
Curious, 1 asked a friend of mine
there, who knows about these
things, how much they had. He ini-
tially said that he was not permit-
ted to tell me. He did then quietly
say, but 1 was amazed. I expect
this from Sherfield, but not ICU,
particularly when, as I later discov-
ered, the figure is on the College
website. I'm not saying that this is
typical, but it does not instil confi-
dence, does it?
Finally, much has been written
about the behaviour of the Rugby
and Football clubs in Southside. I
must say their behaviour was terri-
ble. I have never seen such a
pathetic attempt at boatracing in
my life. No one need worry about
institutionalised drinking here this
year. As for the small fracas, don't
let that worry you. I have since
made many visits to Southside,
and can assure that it is quiet safe.
Beer's not bad, either. Actually,
that's untrue. It is superb.
