24 October 1997 COLUMNS
Few of you will have heard of the
name of Charlie Whelan. This is
how he would like it: he is one of
Labour's 'men in the shadows' -
liaising with the press, ensuring the
'right' kind of stories come through.
This failed spectacularly last
week, when shares fell sharply with
the news that the Government was
not going into economic monetary
union (EMU) - the single currency -
for the near future, having said last
week that it would. It then tran-
spired that there was a rift between
Number 10 and the Treasury as to
what was really going on. The
Chancellor, Gordon Brown, then
had to keep an old engagement
and was seen addressing the Stock
Exchange in front of a video screen
with a sea of red numbers, repre-
senting billions of pounds being
wiped off share values.
So how had this all come
about? The thorny question of EMU
helped in the downfall of the last
government, and the present one
had little better idea of how to deal
with it. No firm election pledge had
been made. Against this backdrop
were the two powerful personali-
ties, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.
They both cultivate a 'nice guy'
image, rather essential in politics.
However someone needs to do
their dirty work for them, and in the
case of Brown it is Charlie Whelan.
He is from the old school of press
liaison, plenty of beer and colourful
language. He had come into the
Treasury with Gordon Brown, soon
in the confines of Number 10,
where he could be kept an eye on.
Brown refused point blank -
Whelan was a vital asset as his per-
sonal 'boot-boy' the Mr Nasty to his
Mr Nice.
The other personality on the
scene was Peter Mandelson.
Whelan and Mandelson openly
despise each other, with Whelan
holding no loyalty to Blair.

Eye
hounding out Jill Rutter, the previ-
ous Treasury press secretary, pre-
cipitating the comment that a
senior civil servant had to make
way for an 'imported hooligan'. Just
beforehand, Tony Blair, mindful of
the trouble that this loose cannon
could cause, demanded that
Whelan be sacked or brought with-
Mandelson had spent so much
time worrying about affairs such as
his Millennium Dome and who was
in charge when Blair was away, that
he (and others) had forgotten
about the tiny matter of Europe.
Labour is still split on the single cur-
rency issue, and although dis-
senters haven't been as vocal as
with the Conservatives, it
has been bubbling away
below the surface. When
one drops the PM and the
Chancellor, plus their respective
shifty sidekicks into the fray it was-
n't too surprising that it could erupt
in the way it did. Whelan had
briefed the press quietly in a
Whitehall pub (so local lore has it)
that the Government was going
into the single currency - shares
jumped and the pound fell - then
later news came that we weren't
actually going into it, and then we
didn't really know, and for a while
Blair and Brown started giving dif-
ferent signals as to the state of
affairs. The press saw the story and
grabbed it, with plenty of column
inches about shadowy spin-doc-
tors, stockbrokers heckling the
Prime Minister, splits, Europe, and
more "Reasons why we must never
join the Single Currency". All in all
appallingly bad press for the
Government; by admission their
worst week so far.

Pumpkin Mania
The time is upon is when thou-
sands of pumpkins are sold on
the cheap, hollowed out, cut
up into scary (not) faces and
finally chucked in the bin. This
is a horrendous and disgraceful
waste of one of the tastiest
autumn fruits. My mission this
week is to show you how to
turn a piece of decor into two
of the most superb orally
ingested taste bud exploding
experiences ever - pumpkin
soup and pumpkin pie.
The soup is simple. Take 1
part waxy potatoes and 2 parts
pumpkin and cut them up into
Vz inch cubes. Over a fierce
heat, toss the pumpkin with
lots of butter until some of it
has browned. Add a pinch of
nutmeg, a pinch of ground
pepper and a couple of cloves
and let them heat through.
Then add the potatoes, a gen-
erous pinch of salt, cover with
water and bring to the boil. This
all needs to simmer for about
Vi hour after which a quick
bzzzz in a food processor or a
thorough massacring with a
potato masher and voila, bon
appetit (note correct spelling).
The pie is more complex. You
will need:
* 1 lb pulped pumpkin. You
make this by cutting up the
pumpkin into chunks, cooking
it in a low oven for 45mn-1 hr,
pressing between two plates to
remove as much water as pos-
sible and then bzzzz or
Ahhhhhhh as with the soup.
2 large/3 medium eggs.
*' 3oz Demerara or Musco-
vado sugar, the darker the better.
«• 4 tbl Golden Syrup.
1 '/z tsp ground cinnamon.
<*" 1 tsp ground ginger.
«" A tsp ground cloves.
®- 'A tsp salt.
»" 80-100 ml double cream.
"~ Enough shortcrust pastry
for a 25cm round tart tin. **
sr 25cm round tart tin (ideal
but more or less any other
oven tin will do).
Preheat the oven to 190°C
(Gas mark 5-6). Roll out your
pastry to the appropriate
shape (use a bottle, there's
nothing better) and line the
(heavily greased) tin. In a large
bowl mix all the other ingredi-
ents thoroughly with a large
fork or whisk or bzzzzz it in
your favourite kitchen motor. It
should end up frothy and light
despite the high specific calo-
rie capacity. Combine the parts
by pouring the slop into the tin
and place in the oven for 45
minutes or until set firm. Eat
cool, do NOT add cream or
your liver will break down.
** Making the pastry is a
bit tricky. Take 225g of whole-
meal flour and 150g very cold
butter. Chop the butter into
smallest pieces you possibly
can and add to the flour. At
this point I usually put the lot
into the freezer for A hour
then with a fork, crush the but-
ter and flour together. The
(unachievable) aim is to cover
every grain of flour in butter
without melting it. Once your
bored of this, add one egg yolk
and 2-3 tablespoons of chilled
water and mix gently. Carry on
adding water until the dough is
supple but not sticky. Now
place the dough in the fridge
for a couple of hours before
rolling out (about 3-4mm
thick).
