MUSIC NEWS
Milen's returned after
another week of scouring
the music scene, and has he got
some news for you!!
Hey y'all, I'm back and in full
effect. First up I got to remind all
to pick up your tickets for Mary ],
the queen of swing is playing
Wembley Arena on the 15th
November. 1 caught her when she
came over a few years ago with
Jodeci and the show was dope, so
don't miss out. Before that we
have 'The Rhythm Nation Tour'
showcasing the best of British with
Shola Ama &. DTnfluence, at the
Forum on 28th November.
The talk about town is the new
Bad Boy offering, the Faith Evans
LP titled 'Keeping The Faith' peo-
ple are describing this as awesome
and the word classic is being
thrown about. The LP should drop
in a month or two and the single is
already doing the rounds on US
promo, with British release hope-
fully not being too far behind. If
this set is as phat as I'm being told
then this will be album of the year,
so keep those eyes and ears open
and remember where you heard
'bout it. That's all from me, C-ya.

The Garage
"W
i e met underneath a
table at Leicester
and we decided to
form the most depressing band in
the world. We wanted to be as
depressing as fuck" - Scottish Mick
on the origins of Prolapse.
Prolapse have just released the
album of the year, no contest. You
can forget your Radioheads,
Verves, Roni (in various) Sizes. The
Italian Flag is the third album from
one of the most thrilling bands of
our time, and is confused, exhila-
rating and beautiful. O h , and
sometimes depressing as fuck.
They're at the Garage tonight to
play eight tracks from their newest
opus (plus a couple of oldies) but
first we're treated to Appliance,
who churn like The Sea and Cake
yet power through with Spaceman
3 melodies. Buy their debut 10"
Into Your Home now or suffer the
consequences.
And finally Mick and Linda are
here, snapping at each other and
smearing Vicks over anything that
moves. 'Really clears the head',
promises Mick, before diving into
the freeform ranting that fills most
of their set. 'Doyou remember the
nineteen eighties? / The music was
crap, the clothes were crap he
screams on Deanshanger, while
Linda prowls the stage, hands
writhing like snakes in a basket as
she does the 'compulsive hand-
washing' dance. She takes over on
Autocade, all icy beauty and
barbed vituperation, while the
crowd froth wildly at the unusually
poppy Slowdive basslines and Lush
guitars. 'Me an' Mick are thinking
of getting rid of the backing band,
they're shit anyway', she teases.
The boys remain impassive, and
continue to pound out aggressive
metronomic beats, twisted
melodies fired by Swans rhythms.
Visa for Violet and Van has God
Machine intensity while Mick
shouts echoing Mark E. Smith curs-
es into a pint glass, the crushing
noise bringing bruises out on our
faces. The sound of Loop is dis-
membered on Flat Velocity Curve,
one chord enough to wield a fright-
ening power. Mick moans about
'Zurich being stained' in a bizarre
Pavement tribute, and then attacks
Linda with an empty beer carton.
The crowd have been whipped into
a pogo frenzy by the time
SlashlOblique tears into us, where
Linda assures us 'You will never
understand me I know I need my
head examined'. And when she
promises, 'I really don't care, and I
might have to kill you / Which
wouldn't be fair - on me" (Killing
the Bland), we only have to look
into her deranged eyes to know
she speaks the truth. The bland is
well and truly dead. Long live
Prolapse. H

Happy End of the World
• • • •
T
he lightness of this album
becomes clear from the first
track, World is Spinning at 45
rpm. This song starts with organs
sounding not dissimilar to the
beginning of Strawberry Fields,
however whilst the Beatles' song
develops into a psychedelic epic,
this song turns into a pure uncom-
plicated pop song. Even though
this and indeed all the songs are
sung in Japanese, the happiness is
there for all to hear.
Not being able to speak
Japanese, 1 instead checked out
the translations of the lyrics and
found yet more evidence of the
light touch that became apparent.
There was no profound sentiment
or political message to be seen
anywhere. All the songs were sim-
ple love songs and not even
doomed love or love gone wrong.
The songs were all about the hap-
piness of love and how lovely it all
is.
Musically, this is a very inven-
tive album, featuring a wide range
of electronic effects and the such
like. Some of the tracks even fea-
ture the sort of high speed drum
loops usually associated with drum
and bass and modern dance
music. But whereas this can often
seem abstract and oppressive,
Pizzicato Five are able to use such
cutting edge techniques and still
sound warm and human. They
describe this album as 'Top of the
Pops for the 21st century'. I for
one think that they're right. CI
