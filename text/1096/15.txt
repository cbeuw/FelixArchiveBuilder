Polythene (Enhanced Version) * * * * v 2
The Spirit of Vampyros Lesbos
Hello! Feeder
calling!
Although this debut album was
only released a couple of months
ago, the recent success of the sin-
gle High has prompted the release
of this so-called 'enhanced' version
- they've basically remixed the first
track and added the song and (CD-
Rom accessible) video of High.
Quite why they felt the need I
know not as this is a bloody good
album even without the additions.
Feeder display good pop sensi-
bilities with some killer hooks yet
for a 3-piece they have a very thick
guitar sound and can be amazingly
heavy when they need to be, yet
still know how to play quietly creat-
ing good dynamical tension.
All of the songs are good and
it's actually quite hard to pick
stand-out tracks on an album of
such consistent high quality but my
favourites include Descend (amaz-
ing build up of tension before
exploding), Stereo World (amazing
opening), the quieter Forgive and
the superlative My Perfect Day
which has an insanely catchy, dri-
ving riff from their Japanese
bassist.
If you like music towards the
harder end of Indie then this album
is a must - it ROCKS with some
genuinely catchy and enjoyable
songs. One of the debut albums of
the year in my opinion - go buy! CI

F
or those of you who do not
know much about early sev-
enties pornographic 'vampire'
films, Vampyros Lesbos is a verita-
ble queen. Originally produced by
Jesse Franco in 1970 (along with
two others in the same vein, so to
speak) the stories follow the
seductive Countess Nadine, played
by Soledad Miranda - who tragical-
ly died a year after the films'
release at the tender age of 27 - as
she hypnotises young German
blondes and tricks them into com-
ing to her castle somewhere off
Turkey, where she has her wicked
way with them. In amongst the
rather tame and often hilariously
drawn out sex scenes the sound-
tracks of Manfred Hubner and
Siegfried Schwab spread their eerie
wings and truly fly. Grinding ham-
mond, belting horns and the
inevitable wailing sitar all find their
place in a stew of hyper-easy
melody bubbling away in a darker,
rhythmatic cauldron.
Recently made available on the
excellent label 'Crippled Dick Hot
Wax', Vampyros Lesbos-Sexadelic
Dance Party has been tortured by
two years of pain-stakingly execut-
ed remixing - right down to the
bare bones of it's blue vinyl press-
ing. This has produced The Spirit of
Vampyros and features an assort-
ment of serious dabblers in black-
magic sampling. Anyone who has
seen the film (and it is out on gen-
eral release on 'Crippled Dick
Hot Wax') will expect some fine
dialogue breaks and here they are -
cast like a spell over what is top
notch breakbeat madness.
Opening with enough tempo just
to get you in the mood, it's not
long before track two kicks it wild
with the start of Necronomania
(lifted from the track on the original
soundtrack), turning it into tuff
drum and bass with a real chase-
scene feel to it. The tracks sink
their teeth one into the next and
by track 9 some seriously dark
bleeps and beats have begun draw-
ing blood - this is not head nodding
music; huge fuzzy bass and
reverbed-out Fender Rhodes all
lend their weight to an album that
rocks - buy it!! H

SINGLES
Bush - Bonedriven
They're big in America, but so are the Ku Klux
Klan and this single is about as appealing.
Earl Brutus - The SAS and the glam that goes
with it
Crazy name, fairly indifferent song. Certainly
not bad, but not a patch on the cardiacs who
they are trying so hard to be.
Depeche Mode - Useless
This single includes a remix by Barry Adamson
and rather a neat CD ROM video of the previous
single Barrel of a Cun. However, you can't get
away from the fact that they still sound the
same as they did seven years ago.
Alabama 3 - Speed of the Sound of Loneliness
I've been assured that this sounds like the
Notting Hillbillies with synthesisers. Sadly,
they're not very good.
Lil Louis and the Party - Clap Your Hands
Unspeakably bad whiny crap. I stuck it in the
microave which was quite fun, but ither than
that I can seee no earthly reason to purchase
this.
The Karelia - Love's a Cliche
This is actually really quite good. It is refresh-
ingly free from pretentions of profundity and is
defnitely worth listening to.

The Charlatans - Tellin' Stories
The title track from the Charlies' last album
keeps up the high calibre of singles they have
released this year. The singing is whiny but cool
and the music is, as always, very cool.
Moby - James Bond Theme
In the 1960s, John Barry was asked to write a
tune for a film for which he had not seen. Now,
Moby brings it into the 90s with the help of a
drum machine and some wicked samples. Both
are brilliant snapshots of their times - listen to
the original and this one back to back and you
can truly appreciate how music has changed
over the years.
Natalie Imbruglia - Torn
Do you remember Beth from Neighbours? You
know, the one with shoulder-length brown hair
who married Brad? Well, she's started to sing.
Torn is catchy and stays on the right side of the
whole woman-with-angst thing that seems so
popular these days. Cool.
Ash - A Life Less Ordinary
This is the title song to that new Ewan
Macgregor film but you probably all know that.
It is so like Ash it's untrue but at least it main-
tains some hope that they will get better one
day since it has little of the pre-pubescent lyrics
they usually come up with. Thinking about it, it
reminds me of Goldfinger.
Black Crape - Get Higher
It's taken long enough for Shaun and company
to get their act together and this is a little dis-
appointing frankly. It has none of the spice that
filled their last album to the point of turning it
into a vindaloo but it is Black Grape and it has
been a long time... CI
