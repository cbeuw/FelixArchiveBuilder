RUGBY CLUB
FIGHTS BACK
Dear Jeremy
Thank you for the attention
your news pages have lavished
upon Imperial College Union Rugby
Football Club over the past few
weeks. You will no doubt be glad to
hear that the matter has been dealt
with and is considered past history.
Hopefully you will now be able
to divert some of your limited
resources to the lacklustre sports
department if only so that the
rugby club no longer has to read a
match report from the previous
week again. How you can print the
correct results on the back page
and then proceed to print the pre-

true lack of professionalism. I can
only surmise that your Sports
Editor is somewhat slapdash and
did not notice that we had played
the same team two weeks running.
It also worries me that you seem to
have ignored three comprehensive
match reports that where handed
in before 8pm last Wednesday
evening. Is it becoming a case of
those sports that do not interest
you becoming sidelined, if not
totally ignored, unless they do
something that portrays them in a
bad light?
Finally, can you please make
sure that the next batch of Felix's
that you deliver to Civil Engineering
have the correct number of pages.
Thank you
Julian Harrison ICURFC Club
