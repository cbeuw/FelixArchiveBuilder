The Two
Johnny Ball, the sav
reveals all to Jon
Fresh out of a Meeting with the
Third World First club, we man-
aged to accost the childhood hero
of the entire physics department -
yes, Johnny Ball will talk. Co down
the bar, have a few pints, and talk
a great deal actually.
Johnny Ball: Oh, are we going
down the iane here? 1 know it.
Jon Trout: You know Southside
Bar?
Ball: Yeah, you know the thing in
March [Baysday] that's always full
of thirteen year old girls. Here,
every year, we've done it for the
last four years.
[They buy a pint]
Trout: So - you've been to Africa
with Oxfam then .What are they up
to out there?
Ball: Well, a lot of people think of
Oxfam as an emergency response,
but in actual fact they are working
in over seventy countries perpetu-
ally. Even places like North Korea
where Westerners are just not
allowed under any conditions -
we've got [somebody] in there
working under cover.
Last year, Oxfam spent 76 million
quid in foreign countries which
works out at about a million a
country, which isn't very much. Yet
overall, it's low-tech requirements
that the people need. They don't
need tractors and stuff because
you can only give those to a per-
centage of farmers and they get
embarrassing. They want low tech
stuff and they want support - the
understanding of how they can do
it for themselves.
They also work in co-operation
with the countries - they don't go
"Look, we're Oxfam, we know how
it works, here you are."
Trout: Can you tell me how a
clockwork radio works?
Ball: Yes [laughs] I'm all for some-
thing like that. It winds, and then it
produces... Well, I'm not sure. I
think it's a sort of Piezo-electric
effect that builds up an electric
charge that runs the radio. Radios
don't need a lot of electricity.
They're all made in Soweto.
[They are interrupted and bought
drinks]
Ball: I met Baylis [who invented
the clockwork radio], actually, two
weeks ago. The £10 ones, which
are quite small and have solar pan-
els along the top, have a small
crank which is a bit weak and in my
case, it broke so we mended it
with a knife, a straight cutlery
knife, and it works very well. They
now produce much bigger ones,
which are a foot long and quite
bulbous - great things for carrying
on your shoulder like ghetto-
blasters. They're £35 to the aid
agencies, but you can buy them
yourself though they cost more.
They took the solar panels off and
put short-wave in. Now, I don't
think the Africans need short-wave
so much, they're much happier to
tune it to local services, that's
where it's important.
Trout: What would you say the
main uses of things like the clock-

work radio are in Africa? Obviously
communication's important, but is
it entertainment, education..?
Ball: Well, what Oxfam are also
doing is setting up radio stations -
solar powered radio stations - that

SURE. I THINK IT'S

are very cheap to install and main-
tain. They cover a wide area, they
really are very adequate and they
get staff who speak all the local
languages. They find that the fel-
lows are quite excited by them - in
Mali the rule is "No politics or reli-
gion on the radio" and that's all -
the only restrictions which is great.
Imagine the British media without
politics! After a while, they found
that the demands for new pro-
grams are mostly from women,
and I've got this great feeling that
the emancipation of women in the
third world will really bring them on
much quicker than anything else.
With religious taboos they move so
slowly. But the women demand
the programs - about AIDS, about
child birth, immunisation and all
kinds of things.
Trout: I want to side-track a little
bit and go to your academic
career. 1 remember covering,
about two years ago a story with
Richard Wilson involved. Do you
want to talk a bit about that?
Ball: When I was Rector of
Glasgow University? I really
worked hard. Within two months
of becoming the rector, with the
help of students we re-channelled
five million quid into sports facili-
ties at Glasgow and they've got the
best sports hall in the country.
Towards the end, it was getting
close to between nine and thirteen
million for more facilities to make

Glasgow more appealing interna-
tionally - something to boast about
- so I wanted to do another term. I
stood on an apolitical platform
with no political affiliations.
Trout: But Richard Wilson certain-
ly does have affiliations...
Ball: He's rather left, you know, a
bit left of Ghengis Khan. But he got
in, and the sad thing was, when I
arrived on the election day, 1
couldn't do any of the hustling and
1 found that my name had been
dragged in the mud - things that
were totally untrue. The Socialist
Worker were everywhere, but sud-
denly disappeared at eleven
o'clock. So obviously there was a
directive. They were giving the
wrong impression there which was
terribly sad because I'd really been
apolitical and I had really helped
people. Even the SOC that was in,
I'd helped them change their vot-
ing system so it was easier, people
who really wanted a job could get
a job. I'd pegged student rent
increases for two years down to
6%, which was the overall increase
of all universities, when they were
trying to stack 12- 13% on.
Anyway, I won on the first vote
with 49%, and the second, the
reappraisal of votes, went his way
- I mean it really was fifty-fifty. If
he works, it's all right, but it was
set up.

Trout: Do you know anything
about what he is doing?
Ball: Eh...yeah (laughs)
Trout: You don't want to talk
about it?
Ball: Some good, some bad, not
particularly.
Trout: OK, moving on...what's
your favourite experiment ever?
Ball: Well I've got one now where
I fire a flame about three metres
over people's heads, so it's just
the latest one. I've got an expand-
ing dodecaicosahedron trick...
Trout: Yeah, I've seen that one...
Ball: ...but I can't find anywhere
that retails them in this country. So
that's a new toy. I've also got a
Tesla coil that's about three foot
six high which produces a spark
interests you?
Ball: There's all kinds of things, like
now they're saying that pets are a
causing a build-up of C 0 2 in the
atmosphere, which is impossible.
It's like saying there are more jug-
glers at Covent Garden so there's a
build-up of Indian clubs and balls
in the atmosphere — they come
down again. C 0 2 won't stay up
there: it's heavier than air, and
when it comes down it grows grass
and plants. So you can have more
C 0 2 going through the atmos-

about a foot long, and that'll light
up two fluorescent lightbulbs held
at arms length by someone. So... 1
just have lots of toys!
Trout: I've been asking everyone
"I'm meeting Johnny Ball, what
should I ask him?", and they've all
been saying "Ask about Zoe!". And
I say "No, I'm not asking about
her".
Ball: Well she's my daughter, I'm
not her father...I mean I am, but
you know what I mean [laughs].
Trout: In science at the moment,
is there anything in particular that
phere. They did a lovely experi-
ment recently on pollution in the
atmosphere in terms of people's
lungs, but they tried to refute it
because it went the wrong way.
They had a cyclist and a motorist
going across London, finishing up
in Oxford Street. They got to the
end, and they found the motorist
had slightly dirtier lungs than the
cyclist, because the cyclist had
been doing reasonable exercise
and his lungs were quite capable of
sucking anything in and pumping it
all back out again except the oxy-
gen. So we do panic, and we do let
the media panic us. It's quite
frightening. The world's going
green, even the multinationals -
they're slow about it, but they've
got to do it. That's another thing:
you don't need Greenpeace if
they're going to be dishonest - and
they are, they're bloody dishonest.
If they recruit radicals who are hell-
bent on revolution rather than
change by coercion, it just causes
trouble and messes the whole
thing up. With honesty they've got
such a good case, they could win
anywhere.
Trout: The editor of New Scientist
said that you were the main reason
British schoolchildren were inter-
ested in science. How does that
affect you?
Ball: The sad thing is that televi-
sion treated me so badly, with
such disrespect, that I don't offer
ideas for programmes for televi-
sion because I don't understand
their politics and motivation. Other
than that it's lovely.
Trout: Do you get people coming
up to you in the street and asking
you "Do you know how this
works?"
Ball: Yes, and I used to say "No"
(laughs).
Trout: Because I was under the
impression for quite a while that
there was nothing that you didn't
know.
Trout: OK, I'll leave it at that.
Thanks.
Jon Trout
