EXPLORATION IN OS A.
In November 1957 the I.C. Explor-
ation Board was approached, on behalf
of a group of 2nd year Botanists and
Zoologists, with a -view to obtaining
financial aid for a proposed scientific
expedition to northern Norway. Offic-
i a l support was eventually received in
the following April, fortunately much
of the major organisation had been com-
pleted by this date.
At the request of the Board the
party was restricted to nine persons,
including two girls. The original
plan, to travel north to Hammerfest,
had been abandoned due to prohibitive
expense and a fresh objective, Osa in
Hardanger, was aooepted.
A multitude of oases left for New-
castle in mid-July, and the party f o l -
lowed on the 21st, sailing for Bergen,
happy in the fulfillment of eight mon-
ths Optimistic speculation. The two
days Journey forged, link by link, x
chain of disjointed memories. The
f i l t h of the Tyne; mountains and sea-
gulls in the sunlight; the great
bridge at Haugesund; torn hands on
tea-ohe3ts; a sick feeling as kilo
after kilo of equipment was charged
for freightage at a fabulous rate;
Bergen rain; snow-oapped peaks mirrored
in calm water; the fjord-side road
terminating in a heap of shattered
rock a few metres from Osa; infinite
hunger.
Osa, a small hamlet of farmsteads,
lay at the head of Osafjord, henmed in
by prodigious peaks. Torrential rivers
raced through two valleys whioh ran
inland from the village and our ears
were never free from the thunder of
cascading water. The base oamp be-
side the smaller river was situated on
the valley floor a mile above the v i l -
lage, in a clearing of the alder wood-
land. Towering to two thousand feet
above were the shear rook walls, frien-
dly i n the sun but dark and forbidding
in the mountain mist.
During the f i r s t night torrential
rain f e l l and by morning, with the
girls almost afloat, i t was obvious that
at least three of the tents were some-
what less than waterproof. The day
was spent erecting make-shift f l y -
sheets, which proved to be invaluable
as there were but eight rainless days
in the following five weeks.
OSA FJORD. C
The almost incessant rain of the E
first week indicated that good weather Q
could not be expected and we soon q
became reconciled to the prospect of
constantly wet boots and damp clothing. A
Despite the adverse conditions, soien- T
t i f i o work went ahead with l i t t l e inter- -L
ruption and a vast volume of data was rv
collected. Of this, more detail
w i l l appear in the report to the Expl-
oration Board,and there is the possib- C
i l i t y of a paper being published.
On the third day two of the party
explored the head of the valley; the
greatest height reached was 3900 f t .
where the lake feeding the river was
found to be heavily ice-covered and
surrounded by extensive snow fields.
The northern face of Vass Fjoro, the
region's highest peak, although snow-
covered, appeared olimbable. However,
due to the distances and olimbs invol-
ved, i t was evident that any scientific
work at high altitudes would have to be
oonduoted from an advance camp.
There was very l i t t l e personal
friction in the oamp, even at times
when morale was lowered by the evil
weather. Few ooraplaints were voiced
about general conditions, oamp duties
or, most important of a l l , food,
although finally the consumption of
'Ryvita* sandwiches, nut, banana and
fruit bars became somewhat of an
effort; The presence of the two
girls added a moderating influence and
led to the cultivation of the art of
ambiguous statement. One never to
be forgotten comment (from a woman
naturally) was:- "He came into the
tent and attempted to remove my pyja-
mas!" (?) a They appeared obsessed
with the removal of clothing (not their
own!) end on one occasion a oertain
young woman, holder of high office,
sprained her thumb during the theft of
my best ereaseless trousers.

a Editor's query.
As the new oollege year starts, one
is more conscious of many facts that
become aooepted as a normal and i n -
tegral part of oollege l i f e as the year
passes. One of these i s the extremely
ni»n number of women in a predominate-
ly male oollege. This i s alone a
major problem in some ways because i t
is unnatural to, have numbers so out of
proportion. Ignoring the side of the
question which demands an increase i n
numbers of women and discusses how to
make this possible, this leaves the
other side which considers what part
the women can or should play.
Judging by numerous conversations
and quoted remarks, the average man
considers the women at I.C. as creatures
to be feared, avoided and ignored as
far as possible. He w i l l condemn
them without knowing them and i f by
chance confronted with any favourable
facts (or otherwise) the retort is
merely 'women' with a shrug of the shou-
lders and the matter is dismissed.
This i s luckily not true of many who
work hard for the oollege in olubs and
societies but these latter are very
much in the minority.
What is the answer then to this
situation? To break down this barrier
of indifference, a woman has to choose
her path oarefully. If 3he attempts
to be friendly, there is the danger of
being thought forward. If she leaves
others to make the first step, i t i s
never made, and she is either dismissed
as dull, stupid or morbidly shy. Some
people may say that there i s no need
for this barrier to be broken down at
»li but surely that i s denying one of
the fundamentals of a University edu-
cation - the freedom to mix and meet
a l l types of people on a oomraon ground.
It appears then that the only path left
for the women to follow i s to be plea-
sant, well dressed and as easy to get
on with as possible thus shifting part
of the burden on to the men.
If the men would only approach the
problem with open minds and be willing
to alter their opinions the situation
would soon be radically altered. This
is not an attempt to throw a l l the
initiative on to the men as the women
must play their part. If both sides
however could play their part, the
benefit that they would then obtain
would be immeasurable.
