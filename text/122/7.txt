Im a l l , twenty Batches sere played
of which eight were won, four lost, s i x
drawn: and two abandoned.
The team occasionally played fine
cricket, but a long t a i l prevented i t
from consistently doing so. On more
than one occasion complete collapse set
in after the f a l l of the third wicket.
Except on days when Carter hit form
the bowling lacked a good spinner, but
was otherwise quite thrustful and de-
served better of the fielding.

Jazz i s now respectable but don't
let this spoil your enjoyment of i t .
If you can play there i s some combin-
ation at I.C. ready to use your talents.
Last session we had a 7-piece jazz-
hand, a modern piano quartet and a main-
stream quartet or quintet i a operation:
plans for the future must await the
auditioning of freshers but probably
two jazz bands w i l l be run, or one jazz-
band and a dance band/mainstream out-
f i t , together with trios and quartets.
A l l instrumentalists are required but
an especial need i s saxophonists.
Freshers, and others who have not so
far contributed to I.C. music-making,
should contact the Jazz Club secre-
tary through the Union rack.
For nan-players, the Club
. -ana a programme of talks and reoard-
reoitals: the unforgettable hall-
packing i.e. Jazz Concerts, so popular
a feature of Union l i f e , w i l l be held
once or twice a term.

O U R T H R E E
The present Boanerges, made i n 1902
by James and Browne of Hammersmith, i s
the seoond of the line - the original
being a 1904 Rover which was with
C. & G. until 1933. In October 1934
the present vehicle was purchased for
£40 from a blacksmith i n Shropshire.
Like her predecessor,Bo' has partici-
pated regularly i n the Veteran Car
Club Brighton Rally and i s good for
many more.
She has two horizontal cylinders,
lubricated by drip-feed, giving a total
capacity of 2464 00s. The inlet
valves are automatic and pressure-oper-
ated, while the exhaust are driven by
camshaft. Steering i s by rack and
pinion; transmission i s by chain drive
with no differential. The carburettor
system i s somewhat odd and ignition is
by trembler-coil. Her anoient light-
ing consists of paraffin side and t a i l
and acetylene front lamps.
In a "Felix" Road Test in May 1953
Bo' registered a speed of
33 mph, and while her acceleration was
not up to modern standards, her braking
was rather better. Petrol consump-
tion i s 12 mpg.
BOANERGES.
Jezebel i s a 1916 Dennis fire-
tender, used by the London Fire-
Brigade until 1932, when she was
sold to Crossfields of Warrington,
the soap makers, who employed her
until 1955. Somejttme during this
period her pumps were removed and
she was subsequently used to tow a
mobile pump. In 1955 Crossfields
very generously presented her to
R.C.S.
Technically she has a 4-cyUnder
(9,121 oc.) engine whioh i s supposed to
produce 90 bhp at 1,750 rpm. Suspen-
sion i s highly dependent - one cart
spring on each corner and no dampers.
The solid tyres, although giving a rough
ride, make steering very light.
She has done about 500 miles since
joining R.C.S., including two trips te
Silverstone and one to follow the
Brighton Run. Anyone wanting a rick
w i l l be welcome, providing they have
polished the statutory area of
brass.

CLEMENTINE
Clementine, the steam traction eng-
ine owned by the R.S.M. Union, was made
in 1919 by Aveling and Porter of Roch-
ester. She was acquired by Mines at
the end of October, 1954- Since that
auspicious occasion Clementine has
steamed on R.S.M. and I.C. ventures, and
her•relations with the Constabulary,
though at times strained, are s t i l l
uninhibiting.
The engine weighs 6£ tons loaded,
has solid rubber tyres, and i s properly
taxed and insured. Two people are re-
quired for her effective control, steer-
sman and driver. The latter must be
licenced under Group A. Maximum
boiler pressure, raised by "Welsh dry
Steam" coal, i s a l i t t l e below 200 psi.
To stop i n a hurry, the 3team regul-
ator is shifted so that steam i s app-
lied to both sides of the pistons, ef-
fectively locking them. Two-speed
gears are fitted, the engine needing to
•be stationary in order to change.
A warning: Should you wish to i n -
spect Clementine when steam i s raised,
do not stand too olose. When 'prim-
ing' occurs, water that has accumulated-
in the cylinders may be shot up the
chimney, where i t picks up large
quantities of soot - which has a consi-
derable • fall-out' area.
