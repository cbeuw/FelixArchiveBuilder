FELIX 5
P R E S I D E N T S M E S S A G E
The Freshmen coming up to Imperial
College this year are most fortunate
in that they are arriving at a time of
comparative peace; a peace unequalled
during the past three years. Admit-
tedly the new Physics Block on the cor-
ner of Prince Consort Road is in the
process of being built, and in addition
Prince's Gardens are rapidly changing
their appearance but the Union build-
ing i s now complete and free from the
experiments of c i v i l engineers.
The amenities provided by the Union
are not produced by the wave of a wand,
as so many appear to be in this modern
welfare state, but by members themselv-
es. Since, then, the Union Building be-
longs to a l l the students, I would ask
them to treat i t with care and to gov-
ern their conduct throughout the Union
with a liberal measure of common-sense,
for i t is the policy here to have as
few rules as possible.
This general principle applies also
in the academic l i f e where work is not
altogether compulsory. The student
therefore has to strike a compromise
between his academic and non-academic
activities. Very soon he realises
that although he comes to college to
obtain a degree, this is not the only
qualification to assist him in his later
career. Therefore I would implore ev-
ery Freshman to make the greatest poss-
ible us* of the opportunities provided
for social l i f e and athletic activity
within the Union. It has been said
that the student who does nothing but
work from 10am. to 5pm. every day, and
pursues no other interest,is a fool.
However I would like to add that one
who takes advantage of his new-found
freedom and does nothing but play, fin-
ally failing his exams, i s a greater
fool by far. The secret perhaps i s to
tackle everything with the utmost energy
omitting nothing.
One complication of l i f e at I.C. i s
the dual responsibility which each stud-
ent holds. For example, I.C. has the
finest reoord of any college within the
University of London, and each student
should be proud to be a member of this
Union. At the same time, however,
he must remember that he i s also a m
e
m
-
ber of the constituent college Unions,
It i s from the latter that the I.C. Un-
ion draws i t s strength and they most
not be forgotten.
A word to the post-graduate Fresh-
men; after three or more years at an-
other University they may be rather
tired of student affairs, but we would
not like them to retire from the Union
l i f e for we can learn so much from them
in a college which has one of the high-
est percentages of post-graduate stud-
ents in the oountry.
Finally, Union Officers have encoun-
tered exactly the same problems as the
Freshmen and are only too willing to
help. If therefore you have any prob-
lems or criticisms do not hesitate to
contact one of the Union Officers,
either by writing or by calling person-
ally at the Union Office under the arch-
way.

On entering College l i f e Freshers
find a bewildering number of social
events confronting them and often the
mental confusion caused by this deters
them from taking advantage of the
available opportunities.
The most prominent events are the
dances and dinners. Every Saturday
night there is a 'Hop' usually organised
by one of the many I.C. societies.
Formal Dances are run periodically: the
Commemoration Ball i s normally held at
Claridges while the Mines, Engineers'
and the Country House Ball (R.C.S.)
are held within the College as also i s
the I.C.W.A. Formal Dinner and Danoe.
At the other extreme ere the most i n -
formal Carnivals organised by the 3
constitutent Colleges of I.C.
Dinner i n Hall i s held every Tues-
day evening, designed to encourage mare
personal contact between staff and stu-
dents. There are two Wine Hal] Dinners.
Periodically the I.<3. Dram. Soo.
produces plays while the I.C. Musio Soo.
organises recitals and oonoerts of
very high quality.
The R.C.S. Smoking Concert, a
function reviewing departmental t a l -
ent, i s a must for R.C.S..
The only 'official' rag day is
Morphy Day, the day of boat racing on
the Thames at Putney. For those who
observe the annual Nov. 5th 'warning'
there are organised fireworks at Har-
lington while far those to wham the
'warning' means nothing the fireworks
display at Trafalgar Square i s worthy
of recommendation.

If you expect me, like the rest of
the shower who write this thing,to
exude platitudes to Freshers, you're
way off the beam.
Personally I've no sympathy with
them, but as long as they go back
to Ealing at five o'clock with their
l i t t l e brown bags snd keep away
from the Bar, I tolerate them.
A block in Prince's Gardens was swept
by fire the other day. Bravo, any-
thing to hasten demolition.
It is rumoured that Prince Consort
Rd. is to become a Parking Meter
area. But don't be alarmed,FELIX
already has a supply of "Out of
Order" hoods, available at 5/- dos.
(Similar hoods are also available
for adjacent P.C.'s but are supplied
free)

On mentioning to the President of
R.C.S. that a Silwood Meteorologist
found the dimensions of hailstones
interesting, he remarked that he
usually sliced and fried his. How
mad can you get?
