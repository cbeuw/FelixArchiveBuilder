Par those returning after a fourteen
week long vacation, the beginning of
term i s heralded with mixed feelings.
The joy, in anticipation of renewed
friendships and social opportunities,
is tempered by sadness. Sadness over
the missing face; the characteristic
laugh that w i l l no longer be heard;
the empty place around the coffee table.
The dock turns f u l l oirole; another
year begins, and Imperial College awaits
your pleasure.
W E L C O M E A L L
Each year we receive an ever inc-
reasing number of Freshmen at Imperial
College. W
e extend a cordial welcome
to everyone, especially to the Overseas
students. In addition to those from
the Commonwealth we have this year four
exchange students: two from Germany,
one from Switzerland and, for the first
time, one from Russia. Far the latter,
we hope that the 3hook of finding him-
self in one of the most decadent hostels
of the Western world will not prove i n -
superable.

BAR THEFT
At the time of the International
Zoological Congress, three C.E.M. stud-
ents removed the college shields from
an empty Bar, against every unwritten
rule of ragging. Strong representation
by Chad prompted their speedy return.

There once was a chimpanzee called
Aristotle, and he went to the University
so his M
u
m
m
y and Daddy were very pleased.
He had a scholarship worth fifteen hun-
dred pounds a year plus fees. Occas-
ionally he went to a lecture but he
spent most of his time playing billiards,
reading thrillers and drinking gin.
Sometimes he would take one of his
girl-friends -out in his MGA, «nrl when,
the summer came he would go down to the
South of France and lounge in the 3un.
In due course he got a First, so he be-
came a professor and seduced his secret-
ary.
RECENT VIEW OF IMPERIAL
RUINS
T H E H A L O A N E
L I B R A R Y
Have you ever heard of the H«I
Library? Most people haven't. The
old Union library, whioh consisted
mainly of fiction,has been greatly en-
larged during the last nine years with
the aid of generous grants from Touch-
stone. These have been primarily de-
voted to reinforcing the non-fiction
sections, and as a result the college
now possesses a balanced collection
to suit every conceivable taste.
Housed off the Guilds library i n the
Unwin building and renamed after a dis-
tinguished member of the college, the
late Lord Haldane, the library awaits
to amuse and to educate. It i s now
under the control of a joint committee
of students and staff with strong f i n -
ancial support from both college and
Union. Mr A.G.Quinsee B.A.,F.I»A. i s
the f u l l time librarian and the hours
of opening are from I to 5p.m. each
weekday.
Every conceivable interest i s cat-
ered for. Amongst recent additions i s
'A Treasury of Ribaldry' ed. by L.Unter-
meyer, or on a slightly more sophist-
icated plane, the complete works of
Arthur Miller and Eugene O'Neill. For
the tongue-tied, 'English Love Poems'
may provide some assistance, as might
that best-selling collection of Amer-
ican Folklore -'The Kinsey Report' -
albeit a l i t t l e ragged at the edges.
Among the seemingly unending stream
of war-books, 'Arnhem' by Major General
Urquahart i s noteworthy, as is Hitler's
Youth' by Franz Jetzinger. The recent-
ly issued 'Concerto and Symphony' in the
Phoenix Music Guides series i s excellent
in i t s field. If you prefer to take
your science from the 'Tele',Patrick
Moore's 'The Amateur Astronomer' will
be familiar. The series on the Hist-
ory of Technology is, surprisingly en-
ough, worth browsing into, and Herman
Oberth's 'Man into Space'makes absorb-
ing reading.
For those interested i n hobbies
other than the above 'The Art of Cricket'
by Bradman i s vastly superior to the ef-
forts of Len and Dennis; "The Focal
Encyclopaedia of Photography', a 'Sail-
ing Premier1
by W.D.Pork and the 'Log-
ical approach to Chess' by Blaire and
Rumble are also recommended. The
Guinness Book of Superlatives will i n -
flate your ego in the Bar.
Others whioh come to mind i n a nec-
essarily personal choice are 'The Church
in Russia' by Spinka and the vicious
•Parkinson's Law or the Pursuit of Pro-
gress'. But even i f you cannot read
at a l l , don't fret. W
e have a useful
Reference Atlas of Greater London, and,
even i f this i s a l i t t l e hard, a series
of jolly picture travel books of Greece,
Turkey, etc.
Last year's membership reached 468,
of whioh 40 were staff. This leaves
over 80 % of the college taking no ad-
vantage of the facilities offered then
to amuse, educate and broaden their
minds in the true spirit of University
l i f e . Our hope i s to make the l i b -
rary the centre of a l l that distingu-
ishes us from a correspondence course
- why not use i t ?
P. H.G. Draper.
