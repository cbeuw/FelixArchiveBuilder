ICRUFC: Stunning 2nd
XV top League table
This week’s game was
a big one, a clash between
the top two teams in the
league. We got onto the
pitch and began the warm
up with a sense of inten-
sity and hunger. Everyone
knew what was at stake.
As UEL made their way
out to warm up we did
notice that a few of their
players looked older than
our very own Ifan Dafydd,
which was slightly
worrying considering he
has just started hair loss
treatment. However, that
was not going to stop us
from giving it our all.
The game kicked off
and both teams began at a
blistering pace. However,
IC were playing all of the
rugby. Had it not been for
a few silly mistakes, along
with a few pieces of dirty
play on their behalf, we
could have put away a fair
few tries within the first
ten minutes. Eventually,
their criminal acts began
to be punished and with
a few beautiful touch
finders we managed to
secure territory as well as
possession. We capitalised
on this when, amidst the
opposition floundering at
the ruck (causing absolute
chaos), George Nicholas
perfectly read the crowd
dynamics to pierce the
centre of a ruck and
barrel over the line. 5-0
to Imperial. An increas-
ing amount of pressure
from UEL and a lapse in
concentration from the
Imperial boys resulted in
UEL’s forwards bundling
over the line to score a
try, which they converted
to make it 7-5. Following
a regroup we picked up
the quality once again and
George went over for his
we knew that we were
capable of getting the win
and even a bonus point.
We continued to play our
game, taking the ball up
through the forwards and
then giving it to the backs
to play their expansive
game plan. This led to
one of the best tries of
the match, that saw the
centres and wings connect
up passing it back and
forth to beat several of
the UEL backs, resulting
in Sam Joon Won Ha
running it over the line to
score his first try. 17-7 to
Imperial. The game began
to draw to a close as we
pushed for that bonus
point. Unfortunately, we
managed to knock-on a
break through that would
have got us the point.
This led to a final scrum
for them on their five
metre line. The forwards
gave their final push of
the game and managed
to win the scrum and the
ball came squirting out of
the back. Being used to
handling big balls under
pressure, yours truly
picked up and ran around
the scrum, selling the best
dummy of my playing
career and diving over the
line to secure the bonus
point for the IC boys. The
game finished 22-7. What
a result.

“Being used to

second try of the game.
10-7.
The second half saw
the UEL boys get more
aggressive and fatigued.
Oddly enough, this
definitely didn’t correlate
with the many injuries
and stoppages they began
to sustain meaning water
could be brought on for
the larger lads who, at
this point, were blowing.
This did not phase us as
Match between the league’s two top teams goes Imperial Rugby’s way.
