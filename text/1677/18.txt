Alias Grace – Exploring the hidden identities of
Victorian women
Like The HandmaidsTale, Alias Grace is a chilling exploration of women’s rights, that has parallels in the modern
age of Trump and Weinstein.

ALIAS GRACE
A
lias Grace
is a six-part
mini-series on
Netflix. It is
an adaptation of Margaret
Atwood’s historical fic-
tion novel about servant
and convicted murderess,
Grace Marks, played by
Sarah Gadon. Similar
to Atwood’s classic The
Handmaids Tale, Alias
Grace discusses the op-
pressionofwomen.Itisset
in the 19th century, when
Victorian women had to
suppress parts of their
personality considered to
be unfitting and vulgar,
thus allowing Atwood and
screenwriter Sarah Polley
to investigate the multiple
identities of women – the
one shown to the world
and the one buried within.
The gender inequality at
that time meant that wom-
en’s stories were often lost
or misconstrued. Alias
Grace is a scintillating
series which unstitches
the complex identities of
Victorian women, and
provides a chilling re-
semblance to the lives of
women today.
The ultimate question
is whether or not Grace
Marks was a key player
in the murder of her
employer, Thomas
Kinnear, and his mistress,
Nancy Montgomery.
Audiences grow increas-
ingly curious as the story
unfolds only to find in the
end that the answer does
not matter. Polley inten-
and power of men.
Told from Grace’s point
of view, she recounts her
life story during interview
sessions with Dr. Simon
Jordan (Edward Holcroft).
As the story unfolds, it is
clear that her sorrows are
caused by men’s domi-
nance and power over sex.
Grace suffered an abusive
relationship by her father.
After she escapes to
become a servant, she
forms a close relationship
with a fellow maid, Mary
Whitney whom she finds
love and comfort in. That
friendship is taken away
when Mary is impregnat-
ed by the son of the house.
A sexual relationship
with men at the time was
intolerable and a fireable
offense – after he refuses
to marry her, Mary has no
choice but to get an unsafe
abortion in secret, which
kills her. Finally, once
Grace moved to become
a servant for Mr. Kinnear,
his housekeeper – Nancy
– who also happens to be
his mistress, formed an
unwarranted jealousy and
dislike towards Grace,
which led to her further
mistreatment and unhap-
piness.
Unlike her “good girl”
identity which she shows
to the world, one of
Grace’s personalities is the
vivacious, sexual Mary
Whitney. These female
characters represent the
two antithetical identities
women could have – a
virtuous maiden or a
whore. Emerging as Mary,
Grace has the freedom to
be sexual and expressive.
Whether Mary was real
or just a character created
by Grace to unravel this
side of her multifaceted
identity remains unclear.
This depiction of Victori-
an women contrasts with
historical descriptions of
women of the time as “fair
maidens in white frocks”
absent of any sexual
desires.
Quilting is used as a
metaphor throughout the
story as Grace can be
seen stitching in every
interview session with
Dr. Jordan. The act of
stitching together two
pieces of fabric takes on
“The gender
inequality at
the time meant
that women’s
stories were
often lost”

as an unreliable story
teller – she lies and twists
her story to get what she
deems she deserves from
a life under the influence

characters
represent

women could
have – a
maiden or a

a larger meaning, repre-
senting fragmented pieces
of Grace’s story which fit
together to form a bigger
picture. Furthermore, it
represents female labour
and domesticity, with the
only outlet women having
to express their creativity
being through domestic
objects.
Alias Grace is sig-
nificant in a time when
“women’s rights are
incredibly precarious
and fragile”, says Polley.
Issues relating to repro-
ductive rights, sexual
abuse, and victim blaming
are as pertinent now as
they were 150 years ago.
coming forward accusing
other powerful men in
Hollywood, proving that
sexual abuse is endemic
in the film industry. “I’ve
grown up in this industry,
surrounded by predatory
behaviour, and the idea
of making people care
about it seemed as distant
an ambition as pulling the
sun out of the sky”, wrote
Polley. The stories of
these courageous women
are chillingly similar to
those in Alias Grace.
Under the Trump pres-
idency, women’s rights
seem to have been set
back decades. A common
picture in the Trump
White House portrays a
room full of men in po-
sitions of power, making
decisions and signing
bills impacting women’s
lives. Trump’s bill to
defund Planned Parent-
hood will limit access
to preventive care (birth
control services, cancer
screenings and pregnancy
tests) – the very thing
that reduces unintended
pregnancies and abortions
in the first place. Women
should have the liberty
to choose when to start a
family or to have children
“Issues
relating to
reproductive
rights, sexual
abuse,
and victim
blaming are as
pertinent now
as they were
150 years ago”
The recent sexual abuse
allegations faced by film
mogul Harvey Weinstein
have proven gender ine-
quality in Hollywood still
lives on. Over 50 women
have come forward with
allegations spanning a
period of 30 years – since
the allegations, the flood
gates have opened with
more women and men
“The stories
of these
courageous
women coming
out against
Weinstein
are chillingly
similar to
those in Alias
Grace”
at all, and access to birth
control gives them that
choice – yet another
disturbing resemblance to
the hardship faced by the
women of Alias Grace.
The mistreatment of
women by men in posi-
tions of power has existed
since time immemorial.
The similarities between
the lives of Victorian and
21st century women will
force viewers to question
the progress made towards
gender equality.
Alias Grace is now on
Netflix.
