Imperial caught sending alumni email scams to raise
money
HANGMAN
The College has been
asking ex-students to
send money to ‘Prince
Alyusi Adiche’ as part
of a scam to get more
donations.

I
mperial has been
sending emails
to alumni asking
them to invest in
fraudulent projects and
transfer large amounts
of money to the College,
an investigation from
Felix can reveal.
A number of former
students were sent emails
earlier this week, with the
subject line “requesting
humbly your assistance”.
The email, which was
sent from “Prince Alyusi
Adiche”, stated that the
receiver had “been select-
ed to assist in resolving a
matter of national securi-
ty”, before asking them
to transfer £10,000 to an
offshore bank account
in order to liberate “$4
million worth of funding
from the National Petroli-
um [sic] Company”.
When the IP address
of the email was traced,
however, it showed that
the computer the email
was sent from was located
in Imperial’s Faculty
Building. Further investi-
gation by Felix revealed
that Imperial had been
passing on alumni data to
an “intelligence screening
company”, called Bright-
Minds, who provided
the College with a list of
alumni rich enough to
donate money, but stupid
enough not to realise it
was an obvious scam.
Since this was uncov-
ered, a number of other
similar campaigns have
come to light: one asked
recipients to donate
funds for an unspecified
“emergency appeal”,
which later turned out to
be a lack of yoga mats in
the Blue Cube. Another
email told alumni about
the “exciting investment
opportunities currently
coming out of Imperial’s
exciting new White City
campus” – reportedly no
alumni were fooled by
this particular campaign.
Felix spoke to one
former student who had
been a victim of these

campaigns: “I was devas-
tated when I found out. I
felt like I’d been made a
complete fool of, and be-
trayed by an institution I
trusted so much. That year
in the Business School did
nothing to help me catch
the scam.”
A spokesperson from
the College told Felix
“we deeply value the open
hearts, and deep pockets,
of our former students.
Their generosity is what
helps keep Imperial
going, since it’s not like
we’re sitting on millions
of pounds worth of en-
dowments already.”
“College have
been using
BrightMinds
to see which
alumni are
rich enough
to donate,
and dumb
enough to get
scammed”
“One student
told Felix
‘my year in
the Business
School did
nothing to
help me realise
I was being
scammed’”

This week you’re not
sure what to be more
upset about: that Imperial
has passed on your data
to wealth screening
companies, or that you’re
deemed not rich enough
to be asked to donate.

James Stewart is
suing the bar for £1
million, claiming its
drinks deals led to him
getting a low 2:1.

A
n Imperial
student is
l a u n c h i n g
legal action
against the Slug and
Lettuce on Fulham
Broadway, claiming it
caused him to get a low
2:1 in his degree.
James Stewart, who has
just graduated from a four-
year degree in mechanical
engineering, is suing
the bar for £1 million,
claiming that “appallingly
cheap drink deals” had
cost him his chance at a
first. Stewart argues that
this will have extremely
negative consequences on
his future career:
“Before I got my
results, I was hoping to go
into investment banking,
or maybe something
really worthwhile, like
management consultancy,
but now I’ve got a low
2:1 all that’s open to
me is continuing on in
academia, or working in
the charity sector. I really
couldn’t imagine anything
worse.”
Stewart’s lawyer made
a statement outside the
Fulham institution last
Wednesday, saying that
the Slug and Lettuce had
“let down its customers”
by offering too many
tempting drink offers: “by
continuing to offer such
free-flowing libations at
such a low price, the Slug
and Lettuce has caused in-
numerable students at Im-
perial to waste their lives
away on alcohol, destroy
their brain cells, and wake
up somewhere in Tooting.
They have a responsibility
to my client, the commu-
nity, and the students of
the future.”
Stewart is also claiming
for emotional damages,
saying that he had become
addicted to the “heady
atmosphere” of the Slug:
“the problem wasn’t the
alcohol – although that
was also a problem – but
rather the sheer inebri-
ating atmosphere of the
Slug. What started out as
a once-a-week phenome-
non turned into something
else: Tuesday, Wednes-
day, Thursday – any event
was an excuse to go to the
Slug. In the end, I simply
became the Slug.”
Felix spoke to Rob
Cotton, the bar’s manager,
who claimed to be “sur-
prised and hurt” at the
legal action. “Our bar
provides a vital service
for students,” he told
Felix, “and it is a core
part of Fulham history: if
this case shuts us down
how will IC ever rate our
strawpedos again?”
The case is scheduled
to begin next Wednesday.

Imperial student sues Fulham Slug after getting low
2:1
This week you cover
yourself in blue paint,
and rock up at the Union.
Everyone’s giving you
weird looks, then you
realise: ACC is next
week.
This week you’re the
Felix Editor, and you’ve
been learning a lot about
how pensions work. Fun!
This week you work in
the Union. You finally
break down and admit to
yourself: the Governance
Review really isn’t that
interesting.
This week you decide
to start a petition to get
Ethos gym to be replaced
with a second branch of
Fusion. Its popularity
breaks the site.
This week you’re in the
Felix team, and you’re
excited by the high pick-
up rate around campus.
Then you realise: this is
what happens when we
run two centrefolds at
once.
This week it’s super
windy outside, and you
finally have something
to make small talk about
with your lab group.
This week you’re so
snowed under by your
lab report you forget that
Trump’s been in power
more than a year, and
we’re all fucked. Small
blessings, eh?
This week you’re not sure
what you’re sick of more:
men doing terrible things,
or Xmas adverts (hint: it’s
always the men)
This week I won’t forget
about the continued lack
of cooked breakfasts in
the SCR. Will you?
This week you want to
write a funny horoscope
about the Autumn
Budget, but you realise
that’s sad af.
This week you get
carried away in the Black
Friday sales, and end up
spending your student
loan on 15 electric
toothbrushes. They were
such a good deal!
