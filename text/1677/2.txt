The University and
College Union called
the changes a "bolt
from the blue", and
said staff would be
worse off.

S
taff across a
number of UK
universities may
launch strike
action next year, follow-
ing changes to pensions
schemes.
Universities UK
(UUK), the represent-
ative group for UK’s
universities, announced
the changes earlier this
week, in what Sally Hunt,
University and College
Union’s (UCU) secretary
general, called “a bolt
from the blue”.
A ballot to consult
UCU members on indus-
trial action will open on
the 29th November. If
successful, strike action
could be underway next
February across 50 of
the UK’s largest univer-
sities, including Imperial,
fined for failing to do
so. In a number of cases,
alumni were not asked
for explicit permission to
share their data – at the
University of Cambridge,
for example, the fact that
data could be passed on
to external companies is
mentioned in their online
data protection state-
ments.
Inastatement,aCollege
spokesperson told Felix:
ICO to launch investigation into wealth screening
“Imperial’s community of
alumni, friends, and sup-
porters is very important
to us. We take the privacy
and security of their data
extremely seriously, and
keep them informed
about how we might use
their data.” They added
they had stopped using
screening firms in 2015,
and no longer use such
services. They said: “any
data provided was done
so on a strictly confiden-
tial basis, and details of
College alumni or donors
has never been sold to any
third parties.”
Elizabeth Dehman,
Information Commis-
sioner, said that the ICO
will “look carefully at
the individual evidence...
to see if, and where, any
rules have been broken,
and what learning there is
for wider practice in this
area”. She added the ICO
has “been working with
the Fundraising Regulator
and talking to universities
about their responsibili-
ties around transparency
and accountability, as
they prepare to comply
with a new, stronger data
protection law”.
A spokesperson for
the Russell Group said
“philanthropy is helping
widen access to higher
education and improve
the learning experience
universities are able to
provide”, but said that
they take their alumni’s
privacy “very serious-
ly”. All Russell Group
universities in England
and Wales are registered
with the Fundraising
Regulator, an independent
voluntary regulator of the
charity sector.
Daniel Fluskey, Head
of Policy at the Institute
of Fundraising, a pro-
fessional membership
body for UK fundraising,
said that such screening
“[helps] organisations to
raise money in a more
efficient way”, and that it
is “a needed and increas-
ingly important part of
fundraising”.

Oxford, Cambridge, and

strikes, union members
could refuse to cover or
reschedule classes, or
cover for sick colleagues.
The current principal
pensions scheme used in
higher education is the
University Superannua-
tion Scheme (USS). It is
a defined benefit pension
scheme, in which the
employer is responsible
for contributions, up to a
salary of £55,550, after
which it switched over
to a defined contribution
scheme, in which the
argues this will make
pensions dependent on
market returns. Hunt said
it was “the worst proposal
I have received in twenty
years of representing
university staff”, saying
UCU “needs to fight it”.
Times Higher Educa-
tion previously reported
a number of universities,
including Imperial, were
unwilling to cover the in-
creased cost of pensions,
and supported a move
to a defined contribution
scheme. In 2015-16,
Imperial spent more than
£80 million on pension
provisions, but also made
a profit of £78 million
over the same time period.
In an email to staff,
Imperial’s Provost,
Professor James Stirling,
recognised that “current
uncertainty regarding the
[USS] is unsettling for
colleagues”. He went on
to say that while “we have
said that our preference
would be to maintain a
defined benefit structure
for USS” that current
information suggests it “is
not likely to be sustaina-
ble at the moment”, and
that “a move to a defined
contribution scheme, at
least temporarily, would
be necessary”.
UUK chief executive
Alistair Jarvis said: “Most
universities can’t afford
to pay more into pensions
without diverting money
from other central areas,
such as teaching and re-
search, reducing their pos-
itive impact.” USS argues
the scheme currently has a
deficit of £7.5 billion.
Dr Michael McGarvey,
President of Imperial
College UCU, said in a
statement that "independ-
ent bodies have chal-
lenged [UUK's] claims as
being partisan and based
on unrealistically negative
assumptions." He went on
to state that "Imperial has
spent nearly £500 million
of its own money over
the last three years on its
estate. The employers
cannot plead poverty, and
any claim that fees will
have to be raised to pay
for staff pensions has no
basis in fact."
The UCU claims
universities have reduced
spending on staff as a pro-
portion of expenditure by
5% over the last ten years,
and argued the decision to
switch from the USS was
not inevitable. She called
the move “another slap in
the face for people already
facing casual contracts
and poor promotion pros-
pects”.
A consultative ballot
was launched by UCU
last month, which found
87% of members would
be willing to walk out
over the pension changes.
The ballot had a turnout of
56%.
The USS is one of the
largest private pension
schemes in the UK, with
around 190,000 staff in-
volved. Discussions over
the changes are expected
to continue next month.

From students to staff, it's time for
us to stand together
H
aving an edito-
rial is a bit of a
double-edged
sword: yes, it
gives me a place to spout
my opinions, even if
nobody really reads it (hi
mum!), but by the time it
gets to 8pm on a Thursday,
I’m usually so tired and
burned out, I can’t really
think of anything to say.
But still, I’m committed
to producing 600 words of
this, and you, dear reader,
are coming along for the
ride.
This week we’ve got
plenty of news to whet
your appetite, but two
stories in particular
caught my eye: the first is
about the support staff at
the University of London,
who are being represented
by a union in a legal case
against the UoL. These
receptionists and security
staff are contracted out,
meaning that their de
jure employer isn’t the
university itself, and
they therefore miss out
on the same employment
benefits as ‘regular’ em-
ployees. They also don’t
have the right to negotiate
with the University of
London directly, but that
could soon change: if the
case is successful, the
UoL will be recognised as
their de facto employer,
which could open the
doors for many contracted
employees.
Here at Imperial, we
outsource our cleaning
staff to Noonan, an
external contractor. The
university says that they
ensure that all external-
ly-contracted staff are paid
£10/hour, which – while
aboveminimum–isbelow
the London Living Wage.
In such situations, these
staff also lack the right
to directly negotiate for
changes to their employ-
ment. I’m not necessarily
saying this is the case with
Imperial, but all too often
this arrangement can be
used to allow institutions
to maintain a surface
appearance of being an
ethical employer, whilst
enabling contractors to
enforce poor working
standards. I’m hoping that
this case will help bring
this practice to light, not
just at higher education
institutions, but across the
country, paving the way
for greater transparency,
and better workers’ rights.
The second story that
really caught my eye was
about potential industrial
action that might be
carried out by academics
come February. In this
case, staff are upset about
changes to their pension
schemes, which many
fear could make them
worse off. Dr Michael
McGarvey, the President
of the Imperial branch
of the University and
College Union, said that
the move would reduce
staff pensions by a
massive amount. He also
said that it’s important to
remember that Imperial
has spent nearly half a
billion pounds over the
last three years on its
estate – “the employers,”
he said “cannot plead
poverty”.
Felix is here to rep-
resent the students, but
we can’t do that without
representing staff too.
While it can be tempting
to see all staff as ‘the
enemy’, it’s important to
remember that they can
be messed around just as
much as us. This dispute
about pensions shows
that – it’s never been more
important for us all to
stick together.
