Felix Politics takes on the Autumn Budget
This week Philip Hammond announced the Autumn Budget. Resident Politics Writer Abhijay
Sood give his verdict on what it means for us.
T
his Wednesday,
the Autumn
Budget was
d e l i v e r e d
by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Philip
Hammond. It entails
details about government
spending and borrowing,
and related policies, in ad-
vance of the next financial
year. This sort of thing
sounds horrendously
dull, but it’s important
to appreciate the state
of the country and what
the government’s up to,
and to treat those making
decisions in our names
with scepticism.
Some will welcome
this budget, while others
will feel it gives cause for
concern. In either case,
this budget is a symptom
of the politically and
economically precarious
times in which we live:
the government can
neither follow through
wholeheartedly on its past
“austerity” policies, nor
can they completely adopt
the positions of their op-
ponents, so they’re stuck
in the middle, with Brexit
further complicating
things.
Housing
The Chancellor is
taking three main steps to
alleviate Britain’s “broken
housing market.” These
are:
• An investment
package: £44 billion over
five years for building
homes
• A stamp duty tax
cut: reducing the burden
for first time buyers
• An increased
levy on empty homes:
allowing local councils to
charge double the tax on
unoccupied properties.
These steps are
welcome, but fall short
of addressing the issues
that underpin the housing
crisis in this country.
According to members
of his own party, such as
the chairman of the Local
Government Association,
the investment plans do
not adequately involve
local authorities, suggest-
ing it will be difficult to
meet the requisite 300,000
homes built per year.
The other issue with this
investment is that, even
under the government’s
optimistic figures, this
target is not reached
until the middle of the
next decade, meaning the
housing stock will remain
insufficient for years to
come.
Regarding the council
tax levy, though this may
generate welcome funds
for local authorities, it is
unlikely to disincentivise
those who own empty
lots in major cities (where
housing stock is most
needed)fromleavingthem
empty. The tax increase
here represents a rela-
tively small proportion of
overall property tax, and
pales in comparison to the
property values. However,
in the countryside, where
properties are cheaper,
this approach could help
reduce the number of
empty properties.
The stamp duty tax
cut is interesting, since
it is likely to affect those
reading this article. We all
welcome a saving of up
to 5k on first time buying,
but the IOBR suggests
these changes will merely
end up reflected in the cost
of properties, mitigating
the positive benefit. The
huge deposits required
to purchase property in
places like London were
not addressed.
The government is also
making an extra £125m
available for renters in
areas where rents have
sharply increased. This is
welcome, but again fails
to address the underlying
reasons for these issues,
which will continue to
proliferate until more
drastic action is taken.
Health & Social Secu-
rity
Healthcare and
social security are the
two largest sectors of
government spending.
On the NHS, £10 billion
has been pledged for
frontline services over
this parliament (next
five years), while NHS
England will receive £2.8
billion over three years.
This is less than half the
money requested by the
director of NHS England
to tackle ever increasing
wait times and issues of
understaffing (for context,
total healthcare spending
is ~ £145 billion). Discus-
sions are currently taking
place between the Health
Secretary Jeremy Hunt
and nurses unions on the
issue of nurse pay, which
has been stagnant since
the Conservatives entered
government in 2010.
Social security was not
discussed at length by the
millions more. Opposition
parties and independent
researchers have pointed
out that many will lose
out under this system
(due to caps, floors, and
tapers) and long wait
times before receiving an
initial payment could be
extremely damaging to
those living paycheck to
paycheck–pushingpeople
into poverty. Former Con-
servative Prime Minister
John Major described
the rollout as “unfair and
unforgiving,” but the
Chancellor has rejected
calls to “pause and fix the
program”. Maximum wait
times have been reduced
from six to five weeks, and
though this may pacify
moderate Conservative
sceptics of the policy, it
does nothing to address
the other concerns raised
by its implementation.
Education & Research
The budget did not
discuss very granular ed-
ucation issues, though its
announcements were still
interesting and relevant
to students at institutions
like ours. It included a
heavy focus on maths and
computing, with addi-
tional staff to be brought
in for both, schools
encouraged to enrol more
students on A-level maths
courses, and an expansion
of a “Singaporean-style”
maths education at
primary level. In address-
ing the numeracy gap
between British citizens
and those of other nations
it is important that,
alongside changes like
these, efforts are made to
change the culture around
mathematics and educa-
tion generally (with more
autonomy for teachers, for
example).
Increases in investment
for Research & Devel-
opment are also likely to
be welcomed by Imperial
students, though the 2.4%
spending target on R&D
by 2027 makes it difficult
to meet a 3% 2030 target.
Tax credits have been
increased (from 11% to
12%), and total spending
should increase by £2.3
billion in 2021-22.
Tax & the Environ-
ment
The recent release of the
Paradise Papers has added
to pressure on the govern-
ment on the issue of tax
avoidance (which is legal,
but widely interpreted as
immoral). In response to
this, the budget included
provisions to tax profits
being directed overseas
at a higher rate than the
corporation tax, primarily
targeting digital compa-
nies such as Apple and
Google. This is a welcome
first step to addressing an
endemic problem: £2.7
billion a year is lost to
legal tax avoidance.
The personal allow-
ance, the value below
which no tax is paid, is
being increased. This
lessens the burden on all
taxpayers, although since
other tax brackets are also
moving, and due to com-
plications with respect
to the aforementioned
universal credit program
(where beyond a point,
benefits are severely
limited) high earners are
the chief beneficiaries
of these changes. The
minimum wage is to be
increased in line with rec-
ommendations from the
low pay commission, but
increases to the “National
“Social

Chancellor, though he
did mention the contro-
versial “universal credit”
programme, wherein six
means tested benefits are
being rolled into one. This
currently affects 600,000
people, but will soon reach
other policies discussed
pertaining to this area in
the budget do not assist
with environmental
problems, and many do
the opposite. Overall
fuel duties have been
frozen, and North Sea oil
producers are being given
a tax break. Even the
diesel levy conspicuously
exempts “white van men,”
highlighting the politi-
cally precarious position
the government is in (not
wanting to be perceived as
‘punishing swing voters’),
and limiting the positive
impact these changes
will have in terms of both
carbon emissions and air
quality.
It’s the economy, stu-
pid
There is no sugar-coat-
ing this: the economic
outlook is not good.
Growth forecasts – from
the non-partisan “In-
dependent Office for
Budget Responsibility”
(IOBR) – have been
revised down. Since the
recession, productivity
growth has been sluggish,
and accounting for this
the IOBR have fore-
casted slower economic
growth than previously
anticipated, leaving us
on course for the longest
fall in living standards
since records began.
Employment reaching a
near historic high is fan-
tastic news (though it isn’t
zero, as the Chancellor
accidentally intimated
earlier this week), but low
productivity growth and
real terms pay decreases
limit the positive impact
this may have.
The government is also
still borrowing more than
it is spending, to the tune
of around £40 billion.
While this isn’t a problem
in itself, it puts the
government in a difficult
place politically. They
have repeatedly attacked
Labour for running
deficits in the past, but
have been unable to meet
their own targets for
deficit elimination since
taking office, moving the
goalposts from 2015, to
2017, to 2020 and now
to the “mid 2020s”. The
emperor has no clothes,
and even this last target
seems unlikely to be met
in light of Brexit, accord-
ing to the credit agency,
Moody’s.
The rhetoric the Con-
servatives have adopted
since 2010 on the deficit is
notable. While Hammond
has softened up a little,
making some sensible
noises regarding invest-
ments and incentives,
even he repeatedly put
forward in his Wednesday
address the notion that the
economic malaise of the
late 2000s was “Labour’s
Great Recession”: that
mishandled public
finances, rather than a
global financial crisis, led
us to the position we’re
in today. You only have
to look at the rest of the
world to understand why
this is not the case.
The Chancellor may
just be playing politics,
but ‘deficit hawk’ rhetoric
will not forever play well
for the government. It
either hamstrings their
ability to pursue sensible
fiscal policy for political
reasons, or will result in
an internal or electoral
backlash once it becomes
clear they’re “just as bad
as the other lot” on bor-
rowing. The government’s
hand might be strength-
ened going forward,
particularly with Brexit
on the horizon, if they are
a little more forthcoming
in this area.
Conclusion
Given current affairs
and the political position
of the government, this
budget has been reason-
ably well crafted by the
Chancellor. It does not
resemble Osborne’s past
austerity measures nor
the feared ‘punishment
budget’. However, it is
indicative of a govern-
ment with little room and
few ideas: addressing
issues around the edges
without the necessary
political capital to affect
root causes. The issues
not mentioned in this
budget, from tuition fees
and social care on the one
hand to school meals and
the ‘dementia tax’ on the
other¸ say just as much
as those that were about
the position this govern-
ment finds itself in. With
economic uncertainty,
worsening forecasts and
political triangulation on
the part of both external
and internal opponents,
Hammond will have little
room to manoeuvre as the
country steers itself out of
the European Union.

Regarding the environ-
ment, Hammond made
a number of overtures
during his address to Par-
liament regarding our role
on the international stage
(drawing sharp contrast
with the USA) and the
importance of tackling
issues including air pollu-
tion. On this front, a new
levy is to be introduced on
diesel cars that fail to meet
a certain criterion, with
this and other measures
encouraging the uptake
of electric vehicles.
