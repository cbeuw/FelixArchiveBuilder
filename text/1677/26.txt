or those of you
who are only just
tuningin,Imperial
College’s Cross-
Country and Athletics
Club has been absolutely
smashing their races this
season, with many more
events still to come. Last
week, they took on the
3rd
race of the London
Universities and Colleges
Cross-Country League,
and didn’t fail to impress
as over 60 runners attend-
ed despite the grim drizzle
and muddy course.
Prior to the race,
Imperial Women’s A team
was in 1st
position in the
league, with the B team
just behind in 5th
. The
Men’s A team sat in 3rd
position right behind UCL
and the B team in 7th
.
Having left campus
at 1pm, the team took
the tube to Southfields
and from there walked
to Wimbledon Common
where the race would
begin. As the runners got
to the start with plenty of
time before the beginning
of the race, they were able
to familiarise themselves
with the course, put their
face paint on and get their
quads warmed up.
The laps were longer
than usual, stretching over
4.5km long, with some
relatively narrow, steep
and muddy parts within
the hilly Wimbledon
Common. However, the
ICXC runners seemed
globally motivated to take
on the tough course.
“The laps

Wimbledon
Common”
After the traditional
team picture, Imperial’s
athletes made their way
to the starting line, and
began their run shortly
after 3:15pm. The com-
petition was rather fierce
as over 230 runners
showed up hoping to
score as many points for
their teams as possible,
all while enjoying the
woodland setting within
central London.
As the women finished
their race after one lap,
the men went on to their
second lap in the mud,
finishing as the sun
was already starting to
set, cheered on by the
women’s team.
The day ended with
impressive results as
Imperial Women’s A team
held onto 1st
place in the
rankings with three of
their amazing runners
placing in top 15: Katie
Olding taking 5th
place,
Georgia Curry just 3
seconds behind her in 6th
and Alex Mundell taking
12th
. The Women’s B team
also impressed as they
ended 6th
overall in the
Women’s ranking. On the
Men’s teams, results were
also very good as the A
team smashed it with three
of their sturdy runners in
the top ten: Harry Scriven
leading Imperial home
in 7th
, Chris Thomas in
9th
and Oliver Newton
in 10th
. This meant the A
team kept their spot on the
podium while increasing
their lead on Brunel’s A
team who now sit a distant
74 points behind, and with
the B and C teams ending
in 7th
and 10th
overall
position, it was a very
successful day. However,
the day was far from over.
“The team
soon made
their way
to Putney
to enjoy a
comforting
meal”
After the run, the
team met up in warm
clothes for some baking
tasting and soon made
their way to Putney as
night was falling to enjoy
a comforting meal at
popular chain of burger
restaurants. Having re-
covered from their run,
they got showered and
changed to then have a
pleasant evening at the
men’s/women’s captains
house before heading
to Embargo Republica
where Imperial’s Cheer-
leading Team was holding
a fundraising event “Save
the Cheerleader”, dressed
in pink as obviously, “on
Wednesdays we wear
pink”.
Overall, ICXCAC
managed to impress again
after an already very
successful start in the
Cross-Country season; as
they have shown it more
than once, Imperial’s
runners are extremely de-
termined to make the most
of their season with two
races left in the LXCL.
Stay tuned as they take on
LUCA Indoors Athletics
competition this Saturday
and watch out for a race
report of last Saturday’s
club trip to the Brighton
10k. Until next time,
cheerio!
