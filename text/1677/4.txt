The study found that
Imperial graduates
commanded the
s e c o n d - h i g h e s t
average salary five
years after graduating

mperial College
London graduates
on average have
among the highest
salaries of UK graduates
five years after grad-
uation, new research
shows.
The analysis, carried
out by the Institute for
Fiscal Studies (IFS) on
behalf of the BBC, found
Imperial graduates earned
on average £42,050 five
years after graduation,
making them the second
highest-paid graduates in
the country, just below
College London.
Graduates from Russell
Group universities earned
£33,500 five years after
graduation. The median
income in the UK is ap-
proximately £21,000.
These data could be
explained by the subjects
on offer at Imperial: grad-
uates of STEM subjects
such as mathematics
and engineering were
among the highest paid
following graduation.
Medicine and dentistry
were the highest paying
degrees, on average, with
graduates earning an
average of £46,700 five
years after leaving univer-
sity. However, due to the
length of such courses,
these graduates face high
student debt after they
leave university: a study
in the British Medical
Journal found that, even
with high salaries, doctors
were unlikely to be able
to pay off their entire debt
before it was written off.
Subjects which grad-
uates earned the least
following graduation
included creative arts and
design, agriculture, and
mass communications.
The study also found
differences between male
and female graduates, as
well as between gradu-
ates of different social
class: male graduates
earn more right out of
university, with salaries
£1,500 higher than their
female counterparts. This
gap widens as time goes
on, with the difference
increasing to £3,500 five
years after graduation.
The author of the study
stated some of this could
be explained by subject
choice, with female stu-
dents more likely to pick
courses such as creative
arts, which have a lower
earning potential, while
admits roughly twice as
many male A-level stu-
dents as female. However,
they concluded that the
difference could not be
explained away by per-
sonal choice.
Students from more af-
fluent families also earned
higher salaries after
graduation, with male
graduates from high-in-
come households earning
20% more than peers from
lower-income households.
Even between those
studying the same subject
at the same university,
there was still a 10% gap
in earnings. The authors
of the study said that this
showed that “improving
access to university alone
is not enough to address
issues of social mobility”.
Imperial graduates among top earners, study finds
“Imperial

earned on
average
£42,050
five years
after their
graduation”
those from LSE. Imperial
graduates earned more
than graduates of the Uni-
versitiesofCambridgeand
Oxford, and University
“The study
found that
those from
wealthier
backgrounds
earned more,
even when
in the same
cohort”
male students were more
likely to pick STEM sub-
jects.Onaverage,Imperial
