FRENCH SOCIETY
YOUR
WEEK
AHEAD
Take some time
away from the lab/
library/568, and go
along to one of the
great events on this
week.
MONDAY 27TH
NOVEMBER
The French event
that everyone has been
waiting for is finally here!
All francophones and
francophiles are invited
to the French Society’s
first Cheese and Wine
on Monday the 4th of
December. This event
will take place at the
Old Brompton Gallery
from 18.30 to 21.00, and
promises to be a great
evening with a classic
French atmosphere.
Tickets are available at
£10 for members and £15
for non-members (our
membership costs £4, so
we’ll let you work out
which option is the best
deal!). You can expect
half a bottle of wine,
and enough cheese and
baguette to keep you
happy throughout the
evening. Please note that
unfortunately this event is
restricted to people aged
18 and over due to the
presence of alcohol.
If this isn’t your thing,
look out for our Pub Quiz
coming up in on the 11th
of December at the Union
Bar. This will be in part-
nership with five other
cultural societies from
Imperial, so come, have
a good time with your
friends, and represent
your favourite country!
In any case, don’t
forget to follow us via our
facebook page (Imperial
College French Society)
to stay up to date with all
our events!

POLE DANCING
OFFICIALLY
RECOGNISED AS A
SPORT!
Pole dance has come a
long way in the past 100
years. From “hoochie
coochie” dancers using
tent poles as props, to pole
dancers performing with
Madonna in the 90s, to the
Duchess of Cambridge
practicing to lose weight,
it has become popular
worldwide to practice
self-expression, develop
body confidence, and
keep fit. Now, in October
this year, pole dance was
granted GAISF Observer
Status, the first official
international recognition
of pole dance as a sport.
This is extremely
exciting news for the
global pole dance com-
munity. Our own Imperial
Pole & Aerial Society rep-
resents the university na-
tionally in IUPDC (think
BUCS for pole dancers)
and will be hosting the
regional championships
this year, so we are no
strangers to the competi-
tive side! There are many
other national and inter-
national championships
where performers show
enormous strength, flexi-
bility and grace, combin-
ing dance with acrobatic
and gymnastic skill (our
President took bronze in
Pole Sports UK!), but as
the IOC requires GAISF
Member Status, this move
is the first step towards
being included on the
Olympic stage.

As a society, we are
thrilled by this news. We
are proud of our sport’s
history from burlesque
clubs and circuses to
studios, and this is such a
clear acceptance and rec-
ognition from the wider
sporting community of
the rigorous training and
extreme physical require-
ments of the moves we
learn. After all, an aerial
split hanging from the
ceiling by your elbow is
still hard in 8-inch heels!
