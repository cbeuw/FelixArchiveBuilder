The case could pave
the way for other
contracted workers
to directly negotiate
with their universities.

A
union has
launched a
legal chal-
lenge on
behalf of outsourced
University of London
support staff.
The Independent
Workers’ Union of
Great Britain (IWGB) is
bringing a case on behalf
of 75 support staff at the
University of London,
including receptionists,
security officers, and
porters, with support from
the Good Law Project.
Currently, the support
staff are employed by
an external contractor,
Cordant Security, and not
directly by the university,
E
minent Greek
molecular bi-
ologist and Im-
perial professor
Fotis Kafatos passed
away last weekend at the
age of 77. He was the
founding president of
the European Research
Council (ERC).
Kafatos was born in
Greece, on 16th April
1940. As an undergrad-
uate he studied zoology
at Cornell University in
New York, before com-
pleting his MA and PhD
Eminent Imperial professor passes away at 77
out the role until 2010.
In recognition of
his work, Kafatos was
presented with a number
of honours. In 2003 he
was elected a Fellow of
the Royal Society, and in
2011 he was awarded the
Leibniz Medal, awarded
to individuals who
promote science.
Following the news,
tributes were paid
throughout the scientific
community. The EMBL
highlighted his “rare
ability to bring together
people, ideas, and dis-
ciplines”, saying that he
“worked passionately
towards accomplishing
three major goals: excel-
lence, inclusiveness, and
cooperation”.

was born 16th April 1940;
he died 18th November
2017, aged 77.
meaning they cannot
negotiate conditions with
the University of London.
Current employment
law states workers may
only collectively bargain
with their direct employ-
er. However, the IWGB
argues this breaches
article 11 of the European
Convention on Human
Rights, which gives
workers the right to join
a trade union in order to
protect their interests.
The IWGB aims to es-
tablish that the University
of London is the de facto
joint employer of the
staff, along with Cordant
Security, which would
give them the same em-
ployment rights as those
directly employed by
the University. The case
is being brought to the
Central Arbitration Com-
mittee, which oversees
regulation of UK labour.
If the case is successful,
it could pave the way for
a number of changes to
the employment rights of
outsourced workers. The
University of London is
among many universities
who outsource part of
their workforce: Imperial
College London currently
outsources its cleaning
operations to Noonan
Contract Services. The
contract with Noonan,
valued at approximately
£7 million per year, runs
until the end of 2019. The
minimum pay rate set by
the College for contracted
staff who work mainly on
College sites was £10 an
hour at the beginning of
August; at the time, this
was above the London
Living Wage, which has
since increased to £10.20
an hour. Imperial is not
an accredited living wage
employer.
In a statement, a
College representative
said: “Imperial is commit-
ted to ensuring fair pay for
all workers. We value all
of our staff, and strive to
offer competitive salaries
in our efforts to attract and
retain the best people at all
levels. Pay at Imperial is
reviewd annually as part
of the College’s local pay
bargaining process with
the Joint Trade Unions.”
IWGB General Secre-
tary, Dr Jason Moyer Lee,
said: “When it comes to
the most important ele-
ments of pay, and terms
and conditions...it is the
University of London and
not Cordant which calls
the shots.” He added: “In
order for these workers’
collective bargaining and
human rights to mean
anything, we need to be
able to negotiate directly
with the university, not
the glorified middle man.”
The Good Law Project
is run by Jo Maugham
QC, and aims to “use law
to deliver a progressive
society”, mainly focusing
on Brexit, taxes, and
workers’ rights. It said
that, if successful, the case
“could fundamentally
change the legal regime
which protects outsourced
workers”. Maugham said:
“If, in the real world, the
brand can also be said to
be the employer, it will not
be able so easily to shuck
off its responsibilities.”
A strike was held on
the 21st November, and
a protest in support of the
demands took place from
6pm in Senate House,
coinciding with a visit to
the University by Princess
Anne, its Chancellor.

The survey, which is
aimed at current and
former students, seeks
to gather data on
the extent of sexual
misconduct on-
campus.

S
exual miscon-
duct by members
of staff across
UK universities
will be investigated by
the National Union of
Students (NUS).
A survey, open to all
current or ex-students in
the UK, is being carried
out in collaboration
with the 1752 Group, a
UK-based research and
lobby group working to
end sexual misconduct in
higher education.
The survey asks stu-
dents and former students
for their experiences of
sexual misconduct by
higher education staff,
as well as their attitudes
toward professional
boundaries between staff
and students.
The move comes amid
an increasing focus on
staff sexual misconduct
A
petition is
calling on Im-
perial College
London to ex-
pand the gym at Ethos.
The change.org petition
was started by Imperial
student Alan Perfect and
has over 800 signatures at
time of writing.
The petition argues
Petition calls for expansion of Ethos gym
that Ethos’ Energia gym
is “currently too small for
the number of people who
would like to use it”, and
that this is “greatly dis-
couraging, especially for
first-time users”. The pe-
tition, which was started
just over a week ago, asks
Alice Gast, President of
Imperial, to expand the
gym into the waiting area
on the ground floor.
The petition has
attracted a number of sup-
portive comments from
students. One student,
who completed their
undergraduate degree
at Imperial, said that
they had stopped going
because it was “far too
small for the number of
people it serves”. Another
said that the gym was not
fit for purpose Others
complained about the lack
of space, long wait times,
and frequent broken
equipment.
Perfect told Felix he
was “really excited about
the amazing response we
are getting”. He added:
“The more people I talk
to, the more I find that
most people think along
the same lines. Something
needs to be done about
Ethos.”
He also cited a previ-
ous change.org petition,
started by Felix, to build
air conditioning in Central
Library: “Some people
have asked whether gym
expansion is a realistic
goal. And it is. Back in
May 2016, Felix started
a petition to get air condi-
tioning in the library. Fast
forward a year and a half,
and a massive investment
has been made to install
air conditioning. Change
is possible.”
Perfect told Felix that
the immediate aim was
1,000 signatures: “From
there, we can start pres-
suring College and getting
the Union more involved
in a proper campaign"
Not all students agree,
however. One student,
writing in Felix this week,
said that part of the issue
was with students not
using gym equipment
properly, and called for a
“treadmill walking ban”.
Energia is part of
Imperial’s Ethos sports
centre, located in Prince’s
Gardens, on the South
Kensington campus.
Ethos also has a swim-
ming pool, and a fitness
studio. Ethos recently
changed their out-of-term
opening hours, reducing
them by two hours each
weekday, and four hours
at weekends.
in higher education.
Hareem Ghani, NUS
Women’s Officer, stated
that “many institutions are
ill-equipped to deal with
instances of student-staff
harassment (or indeed,
harassment in general)”.
Earlier this year, The
Guardian carried out an
investigation into sexual
harassment on-campus,
and found over 300
claims had been made
against staff across the
UK in the past six years.
The Guardian also
found one-third of UK
universities did not have
a policy on staff-student
relationships. Imperial’s
policy states relationships
with students represent “a
potential conflict of inter-
est” for staff and need to
be declared to their Head
of Department.
Dr Anna Bull,
co-founder of the 1752
Group, described the data
as “much needed”, saying
that “universities do not
currently have adequate
procedures in place to
protect students and deal
with perpetrators”, with
students feeling “power-
less” when trying to report
staff sexual misconduct.
Dr Bull said: “It is time
for the higher education
sector to take [sexual
harassment and abuse] se-
riously. We hope that this
research will lead the way
towards these much-need-
ed changes.”
Ghani went on to say
that sexual misconduct
cases “have been at best
sidelined and at worst
silenced by institutions”.
The Union told Felix:
“We hope that this survey
informs the wider con-
versation around sexual
misconduct in Higher Ed-
ucation. We encourage all
of our members to com-
plete it and look forward
to working in partnership
with others to tackle this
problem, creating a more
inclusive culture for our
communities.”
The 1752 Group was
founded in 2016, to raise
awareness and combat
staff sexual misconduct
in higher education. The
group includes Dr Emma
Chapman, a Royal Astro-
nomical Society Fellow
based at Imperial, who is
also a member of the De-
partment of Physics’ Juno
Committee, which en-
courages gender equality.
Professor Alison Phipps,
Director of the Centre
for Gender Studies at the
University of Sussex, sits
on the advisory board.
Professor Phipps was one
of the researchers who
led the investigation into
Imperial’s institutional
culture last year, in which
one participant spoke of
a culture of Imperial's
“ingrained misogyny”.
The survey is open until
December 15th 2017. It is
