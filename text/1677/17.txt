King Gizzard takes a field trip to Polygondwanaland
T
he Gizz is
back with their
fourth effort of
the year, and it
sounds like they’ve been
listening to too much
Tool.
Fans of the the proggy
indie hard rock outfit
(like the B52s on crack)
went into this year fresh
off their fantastic effort
Nonagon Infinity, in
eager anticipation of
the announced attempt
to release five albums
by the year’s end. And,
so far, it’s been mixed.
Gizz explores interesting
corners of music on each
work - Flying Microtonal
Banana fooled around
with notes outside the
chromatic scale, Murder
of the Universe was a
multi-narrative concept
album, and Sketches of
Brunswick East turned
into a jazz-influenced
effort (c.f. Miles Davis’s
Sketches of Spain).
All of this undoubtably
will pay off eventually,
in the sense that King
Gizzard has displayed
cross-style proficiency.
They’ve seriously
enhanced their musical
palette in the brief time
since Nonagon, and I’m
psyched for what’s in
store two or three years
down the line. In the
meantime, though, this
feels like lots of diddly
experimentation, rushed
out of the studio maybe
just a bit too prematurely.
The problem is that re-
leasing albums one-after-
the-other like this doesn’t
leave a lot of time for
polish. The albums feel
inchoate and occasion-
ally uninspired. Though
they’re writing some of
their best music right now,
the lines don’t really come
together in the refined way
you’d expect from a band
of King Gizz’s stature.
There are rough edges,
and the past albums this
year completely lack
the magnetic pull that
graces their earlier efforts.
Sketches might be jazz-in-
fluenced, but it ends at a
swing drumline and the
occasional brass work; it’s
not like they’ve gone and
learned jazz harmony in
the few months since their
last album. They’re still
very much King Gizz, but
it falls flat, like they’ve
run out of gas.
And that’s near
where we’re left with
P o l y g o n d w a n a l a n d .
On the one hand, this
is quite an addition to
their ouevre - there are
fantastically atmospheric
vocal harmonies (Stu’s
been practicing) and
wonderful electronic
textures on this album.
Gizz also shows off some
mad rhythm, weaving in
and out of uncommon
time signatures from bar
to bar with the agility of
a proper djent band. Cop
the 7/4:4/4 polyrhythmic
synth line on ‘Desert
Dunes Welcome Weary
Feet’ (thanks for working
that one out, Pearson <3)
and tell me that’s not real
talent. It’s hard to pick one
of many examples of this
sort of proficiency, but
the subtlety with which
it’s performed is frankly
jaw-dropping, and it’s all
over the place here.
But that’s partly the
problem with this album
- this feels in many places
more like an extended
poly experiment.The band
plays tightly throughout,
but I’d like more melodic
interplay than what’s cur-
rently on offer. And while
the amped-up blast-your-
face-off performances
that define Gizz have
been on show moreso
on this album than any
of the others this year,
it still feels like they’re
missing that magic Gizz
spark, something that
comes only after months
and months of refining
the tunes. The album has
a lingering feeling of
being rushed, recorded
and mastered with more
attention to deadlines than
the quality of the work
itself. It’s a good album,
but it’s not up to King
Gizz’s snuff.
Still, I find this the most
listenable and appealing
album they’ve put out this
year. For a free download,
you can’t do much better.
Cory Henry brought the funk back to London last week
H
osted at
KOKO, the
venue’s at-
mosphere was
perpendicular to that of
the typical Friday night.
An empty smoking area
and non-sticky floors
paid tribute to the
multi-layered theater
environment as an
ideal place to host a gig
(though drinks prices
were unfortunately the
same as any regular
Saturday, without the
bulk deals.)
The support act
XamVolo set the scene
with an ambient bass-
filled set, mixed with
groove and soul, with
very clear influence from
artists such as Anderson
.Paak and Shaun Martin.
Their sound was filled out
by backing tracks recre-
ating the heavily mixed,
sub-octave tracks in a
live performance. The set
closed with ‘Old Soul’, a
song which has a lot more
kick to it when performed
live. These guys are defi-
nitely worth a listen.
During the interlude,
the iconic Hammond
organ and Leslie speaker
were set up right in the
middle before Cory and
his funk apostles took to
the stage.
Cory, as usual, im-
pressed us all with fan-
tastic solos, trading bars
seamlessly throughout
most songs. The star of
the band, however, was
Nick Semrad, the keys
player set up stage left.
He pulled out beautiful
ambient keys patches and
rhythmic synth lines in
every song. Unfortunately
he wasn’t given his time
to shine ‘til near the end of
the gig. When his moment
in the spotlight came,
Cory queued him in for a
solo, he began gliding up
and down his synth, and
the crowd went wild. In
my controversial opinion
he was more impressive
than Cory himself (ed:
hate to music.felix@ic.ac.
uk). Look out for his name
in future gigs - you don’t
want to miss those chops
or the fantastic face he
pulls during a pitch bend.
The most tight song
from the night was a cover
of ‘Stayin’ Alive’ by the
Bee Gees. They took
laid-back tune and gave it
10 tonnes of punch. The
rhythm section, Taron
Lockett and Sharay Reed,
locked into the pocket,
providing the backbone
of the groove for keys
and guitarist Adam Agati
to dance around. Cory, as
usual, threw a lot of heavy
organ sounds and has the
voice to match. Looking
at some of his earlier live
performances, he has not
usually been one to take
the stage with his vocals,
but the man has quite
obviously been practising,
and the work has definite-
ly paid off.
Overall, the gig was
exactly what you’d expect
from a bandleader with
Snarky Puppy on his
resume: a metric shit-ton
of funk laid down by some
of the greatest musicians
working today. Look out
for him next time he’s
around London.

Who needs kick drums when you have trance?
W
hen you
think of
countries
and good
dance music, Italy defi-
nitely doesn’t come to
mind. The age of Giorgio
Moroder and Italo Disco
(or as it later became
known, disco) are long
gone, and we have been
left with the Crookers
and Gigi D’Agostino.
In short, Italian dance
music is terrible.
Then came Lorenzo
Senni. The man coined
the term “pointillistic
trance” to describe his
music, which consists of
trance buildups but with
no buildups. To quote
his SoundCloud page,
Lorenzo is “a sadistic
scientist that is ripping the
spinal cord out of trance
and dangling it in front of
our eyes.”
I had my doubts about
this. It’s an interesting
idea, but that’s all – listen-
ing to his Rinse FM mixes
is not very enjoyable for
example, especially if
you’re sexually frustrated.
My brother used to listen
to trance and I have a bit
of a soft spot for it, but
even I can’t endure two
hours of very repetitive
buildups that go absolute-
ly nowhere.
Add that to the fact that
LorenzoSenniisquitepre-
tentious and I didn’t have
high hopes for this rave.
Appearing about half an
hour later, all he did was
press play on Ableton and
then stand there looking
conceited, his annoying
moustache perched on top
of a mouth pursed into
what was supposed to be
a bassface, but actually
just looked like a cat’s
bottom. As he stood there,
dancing out of time and
letting his computer do
all the automation on his
synth, I started to get quite
annoyed.
After 7 minutes, the
first loop (for it was a
loop, not a song) ended
and the next one started.
When I said that Lorenzo
wasn’t for those suffering
from dry spells, that was a
lie – the stabs in this tune
were bassy enough to rival
any kickdrum, and people
were properly dancing.
Later in the evening, the
synth produced sounds
so heavy that despite
earplugs, my ears actually
hurt from the vibrations,
something I’ve only
experienced with Dub
soundsystems before.
Being liberated from a
kickdrum meant that the
stabs and arpeggiated
saws carry the rhythm of
the track, and I noticed
that people were dancing
almost as if they were
hearing grime tracks.
At that point, about 15
minutes in, I really started
enjoying myself, more
than I’ve enjoyed any
of the DnB nights I’ve
been to recently. And as
I quite literally got lost
in a trance, I thought to
myself that Lorenzo was
trying to tell us something
important through his
music – that the buildup
is just as important as the
drop, that the best part of a
project is doing it and not
seeing it realised.
At this point, after only
45 minutes, the music
stopped, and after almost
an hour of keeping it in I
went to relieve myself.
Bowie, Berlin, and battling sobriety
U
n o f f i c i a l l y
d u b b e d
‘the Berlin
Trilogy’, the
three studio albums that
David Bowie produced
between 1977 and 1979
were arguably him at his
creative peak. With the
help of Brian Eno, Low,
“Heroes”, and Lodger
brought all kinds of
sonic experimentation,
far from the Ziggy-era
flamboyance and Thin
White Duke stoicism.
The name for this set,
however, is misleading;
not only was it, for the
most part, not even
recorded in Berlin, but
also the big Bowie um-
brella spans far wider
than just those three
albums.
Things weren’t looking
so swell for Bowie in ‘76.
Sure, he’d just released a
truly remarkable album
in Station to Station, but
he didn’t even remember
recording it. Existing on a
diet of solely red peppers,
milk and cocaine, he was
slowly losing his grip on
reality, and was convinced
that Led Zeppelin guitarist
Jimmy Page had placed a
curse on him and was
trying to steal his semen.
Probably time to take a
break.
And so he did. Sort
of. Leaving the toxic LA
microcosm behind, he
upped sticks and moved
to Berlin in an effort to
sober up, taking with him
his friend James Oster-
berg, who was struggling
with his own addictions.
Osterberg, perhaps known
better as Iggy Pop, was
fresh out of the breakup of
raucous proto-punk band
The Stooges, and looking
to form a solo career,
sought Bowie’s help.
The first of many
collaborative outputs for
them was 1977’s The
Idiot. Though it’s an Iggy
Pop album in name, it’s
not unreasonable to say
that Bowie was the main
creative driving force
behind it. A bit rough
around the edges, the bulk
of the recording was done
in Chateau d’Herouville, a
big mansion in the middle
of just about nowhere,
with very little in the way
of proper engineering.
As a result, the sound is
gnarly and raw; Pop’s
characteristic gravelly
snarl paired with Carlos
Alomar’s buzzed guitars
makes for something of
an auditory assault.
Lyrically, the themes
are dark. From the
Oedipal nightmares of
‘Sister Midnight’ to the
reflections on overdoses
in ‘Dum Dum Boys’,
Pop’s visceral and often
spontaneous wordplay
drench the LP in macabre
hues. It’s not all doom
and gloom however, the
throbbing ‘Nightclubbing’
seeks to bring the sensa-
tions of Berlin’s pulsating
nightlife, and there’s
literally a song called
‘Funtime’.
Musically, clear
inspiration was taken
from German Electronic
Krautrockers Kraftwerk,
with extended progressive
jams that verge into indus-
trial territory, particularly
notable on the sprawling
closer ‘Mass Production’.
It served as a litmus test
for the desolate sound-
scapes that were to follow
on Low and “Heroes”.
Bowie even tested the
water with ‘China Girl’,
which he would release
as a single of his own
six years later, though
arguably without the
desperation and longing
that set it apart in Iggy’s
version.
It was a vital stepping
stone for both involved
artists, but not without
its own intrinsic artistic
merit. The bastard child of
the Berlin Trilogy remains
the often forgotten jewel,
a rough diamond that,
when polished, sparkles
as bright as the best of
them.
