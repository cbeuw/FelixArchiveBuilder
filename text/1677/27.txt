Friday 10th
N o v e m b e r ,
6pm. 10 members of the
Imperial College Sailing
Club embarked on a great
adventure: The Plymouth
Pasty 2017! A great sail-
ing competition hosted by
Plymouth University with
a number of universities
from around the country
competing!
6 hours stuck on a
Megabus, the perfect
opportunity to catch up on
work and sleep after a long
week at uni… or not. The
journey began calmly with
films and crafts – making
protest flags and fan-
cy-dress animal ears. We
then stepped up our game,
cracking open a cold one
and eating pizzas which
we ordered at Exeter
coach station (a very good
idea for anyone planning
a coach journey anytime
soon) in preparation for
our final destination – the
Plymouth Student Union.
At 9am the following
morning, fuelled by a
much needed Maccies
breakfast, we were
pumped for a day of racing
despite the very strong
westerly wind which had
set in. Imperial White
team (consisting of helms
Aidan Bell, Toby Freeland
and Oliver Kidd and crews
Michal Wojnowski, Mary
Chapman and Ariane
De Saint Victor) got off
to a rusty start having
never trained together as
a team and experiencing
several boat breakages.
However, after a couple
of races we were starting
to gel together and really
took advantage of the
event as an opportunity to
practice the tactical side
of team racing, executing
some great mark traps
and gybe backs to convert
team members through
and achieving some solid
winning combinations.
Meanwhile the London
Purple team (consisting
Taekwon-don’t mess with us
Imperial Taekwondo off to a great year with many wins in the first two competitions of the year!

N
erves, adrena-
line and a lot of
sweat. That’s
the feeling you
get when you are right
there, face to face with
your opponent in the ring.
That is exactly what 17
Imperial College London
students experienced last
weekend (November 19th
)
in the Imperial College
Open (ICO) and London
University Sports League
(LUSL) Taekwondo
Competitions, where
a total of eleven gold,
three silver and six
bronze medals were won
by the university club
(ICUTKD).
We got up before
dawn to meet at South
Kensington Station, from
where we started our long
journey to the Jean Brown
Indoor Sports Arena.
Nobody could decide
whether they were more
tired, hungry or nervous
as the tube stopped at
station after station after
station. Zone 4 has never
felt so far.
After weigh-in, it was
finally time for the com-
petition to start: the draws
were up. We knew who
our opponents were going
to be, how many fights
stood between us and that
gold medal. As some of us
stepped into the ring for
the first time, it seemed
like the entire team was
there with them. Our name
bounced off the walls,
interspersed with “ICU –
TKD” chants. Every kick
that landed was greeted
with a cheer and when
someone managed to get
past our defences there
was considerable booing.
After 9 hours of com-
petition, the Imperial
College London Team
came home victorious.
Not only did we achieve
four gold, one silver and
two bronze medals in
LUSL and seven gold,
three silver and four
bronze in LUSL, but we
also placed 2nd
in the
overall university ranking,
beating teams more than
twice our size. Some high-
lights of the competition
were the four gold medals
won in both ICO and
LUSL by our black belts
considered two of the best
in the country. However,
they were not the only
ones with outstanding
performances; Menghan
Liu (two golds), Sharmila
Rana (one gold, one
silver) and Cynthia Ho
(one gold), all at their third
competitions, showed all
of us that hard-work and
strong discipline can take
you wherever you dream
of. Particularly impressive
was Emilie Pria, who won
a gold having taken up
the sport only six weeks
ago and Sophia Pali, who
recently switched from
poomsae (patterns) to
sparring (fighting style)
and obtained one gold and
one bronze.
ICO (Imperial College
Open) is an annual student
competition that started
out at our university in
2012. Every year the event
has grown, attracting more
and more competitors
from all over the country.
This year there were more
than 240 students fighting
(and many more boosting
morale from the side-
lines), making it one of
the biggest and probably
noisiest martial arts uni-
versity competitions in
the UK. In fact, the cham-
pionship has proven to be
so successful that, starting
from 2017, BSTF (British
Student Taekwondo
Federation) has stepped
in to organise the event.
This ensures ICO will
reach and accommodate
for even greater numbers
of participants and institu-
tions.
On the other hand,
LUSL(London University
or experience in this dis-
cipline. The competitors
are split into categories
to guarantee fair fights,
which depend on skill
level (A, B or C class),
gender and weight. Points
can be scored with kicks
to the head, body and
punches, with a bonus for
spinning kicks. All under
the careful supervision
of the central referee and
corner judges.
This weekend, our
team scored more points
per competitor than any
other university. Imperial
College Taekwondo will
travel to Birmingham next
on the 3rd
of December
for another day of fierce
competition. We will
do our best to continue
winning medals in the
name of our university,
but more importantly, we
will continue having fun,
supporting each other and
pushing ourselves to our
limits.
Last but not least,
thanks to the instructors,
coaches and out alumni
who spend their own
time and effort to help
us out. As well, thanks
to all external instructors
who have helped us get
to where we are and
everyone who came to
support us or volunteered
in the event.

lent performance. They
won all but two of their
races and only just losing
out to the Imperial White
team despite a spectacular
capsize by Aidan.
Re-energised by our
afternoon naps, Imperial
White as zebras and
London Purple as snow
leopards jumped back
into party mode for the
evening. The dinner was
burgers and fries which
many freshers ended up
eating without hands. It
was a good opportunity to
interact with sailors from
other universities off the
water in a non-competi-
tive environment. There
were many games and
chants and eventually a
food fight, leaving purple
coleslaw up the white
walls and puddles of
drinks and mayo on the
wooden floors. Yet the
restaurant owner quipped
that we were ‘nowhere
near as messy as they
had anticipated’ (if only
we could find restaurants
this tolerant in London!).
The social moved on to
Pryzm so Toby and Aidan
could cut some shapes
before retreating back to
our host’s house for some
much-needed rest.
Sunday morning saw
yetstrongerwinds,gusting
45 mph, despite this we
were briefed that racing
would continue as normal
using smaller cut-down
sails. We got changed and
nursed our hangovers. By
11am, the postponement
flag was still raised, we
took two minutes silence
for remembrance Sunday
then continued to wait
for racing to commence.
Eventually the decision
was made to launch the
boats but only two races
were completed before the
event was called to an end
due to many capsizes, boat
breakages and support
boat breakdowns!! Lunch
time came around, and
of course, being so near
to Cornwall, we couldn’t
miss the opportunity to
eat pasties! Drawing an
end to the day, the prize-
giving saw Imperial White
coming in an overall 2nd
position and London
Purple in 5th
a great per-
formance from both teams
and really fun weekend!

wonderful event as well as

reaction to what he thinks
was a Jägerbomb.

Sports League) is some-
thing many of you might
already be familiar with,
since it was launched in
2012 by BUCS (British
Universities & Colleges
Sport) for many different
sports. Taekwondo is only
a recent addition though,
so it is impressive that 140
competitors showed up
for the event on Sunday
morning.
This year, both com-
petitions were held on
the same day, one after
another. Any student
can participate in ICO
and LUSL, regardless of
gender, level of fitness
