A New Hope: Zimbabwe’s new birth of
freedom … or more of the same?
How significant is the fall of Robert Mugabe’s 37 year brutal regime, and is there any light at
the end of the tunnel for Zimbabwe

A
fter 37 years,
R o b e r t
Mugabe is
no longer the
president of president
of Zimbabwe. Many
people, including myself
(having lived there for
the first year of my life),
had stopped wondering
if this day would ever
come until events began
to rapidly unfold last
week. Almost overnight,
the Zimbabwean mili-
tary had put the Mugabe
family under house
arrest, taken control of
the state broadcaster and
of the streets of Harare,
limiting access to gov-
ernment buildings. The
military questionably
claimed that this was not
a coup. Following this,
massive demonstrations
encouraged by the army,
opposition parties and
even Mugabe’s own
party ZANU-PF led to
Mugabe resigning on
Tuesday to prevent him
from being impeached.
beingsackedasvice-presi-
dent on the 6th November,
a move that was almost
certainly orchestrated
by Mugabe’s incredibly
unpopular wife, “Gucci”
Grace. Those loyal to and
high up within ZANU-PF
who were once Mugabe’s
cronies now felt betrayed
by her increasing influ-
ence and decided to finally
intervene. Mugabe is now
93 so contention for his
successor has recently
been growing with Mnan-
gagwa “the Crocodile”
expected to take this role,
however Grace Mugabe’s
desire to acquire power
when her husband dies
has stimulated her to
systematically remove
anyone who is in her way.
Not only is she hated by
a majority of the country,
she is 41 years younger
than Mugabe and the view
that she didn’t play a part
in the war for independ-
ence is key to why those
leading the ‘Coup de
Grace’ want both of them
removed.
Looking back over
the past 37 years of
Zimbabwe as a country, it
is shocking that Mugabe
had been able to abuse
his authority which has
brought sustained deteri-
oration and inequality to
what was once the bread-
basket of Africa for so
long. He became leader
of Zimbabwe as a widely
supported liberator when
the white minority rule
of the colonial Republic
of Rhodesia, Zimbabwe’s
previous name, was taken
over after years of civil
war by winning the 1980
election. Initially he
worked towards co-op-
eration between former
white oppressors and
improving the lives of the
poorer Africans, allowing
the country to prosper.
This didn’t last long, as
after just a few years he
used brutal assaults to
target any challenge to
his dominance, which was
followed by continued
corruption throughout his
party. In 1983 Mugabe
used the notorious Fifth
Brigade trained by North
Korea to torture, rape and
massacretheNdebeletribe
who supported his main
rival during the election.
In 1999 trade unions
formed an opposition
which included support of
farmers originally respon-
sible for the country’s
earlier success, causing
him to allow supposed
war veterans and his
supporters to seize farms
and evict the farmers by
any means. Most people
are familiar with the hy-
perinflation that followed
(500 million% according
to the IMF) as the country
lost its income and tried
to solve the problem
by printing money. In
2008 when another party
defeated him in elections,
his party used violence to
force them into submis-
sion.
It is no surprise then
that on the day Mugabe’s
resignation was an-
nounced, the streets of
Zimbabwe were filled
with people celebrating
- but this is dangerously
misleading. The take-over
led by General Chiwenga
isn’t a revolution - the
likes of Mnangagwa who
will succeed Mugabe
want to keep the country
in hands of the klepto-
cratic elite who aren’t
interested in democra-
tisation or developing a
fairer system. Essentially
all that will happen is a
change of powers within
ZANU-PF and more im-
portantly stabilisation of
the party before the next

election in September
2018. This is crucial if
government fat-cats want
to keep control of lucra-
tive resources in farming,
mining and foreign
currency. Learning from
the past, it seems inevita-
ble that while the people
at the top fight over their
self-interests, the needs of
people are left forgotten
once again.
It is clear that immense
reforms and new ideas
are needed, including
dismissal of the apparent
divine right to lead based
on contribution to the
war of independence
allowing those in power
to be held accountable
and those in disagreement
not being rejected as
“counter-revolutionary”.
The current opposition to
ZANU-PF is unorganised
and disjointed, the main
figure Morgan Tsvanga-
rai was discredited and
taken advantage of after
beating Mugabe in the
2008 elections. There
are others such as Joice
Mujuru, Simba Makoni
and Nkosana Moyo
who look promising in
supporting real change.
There is also hope in
Mnangagwa’s future as
leader despite him being
just as evil as his former
master; he recognises that
help from international
donors and aid as well as
re-establishing the com-
mercial farmers and using
their skills is required to
rebuild Zimbabwe from
its severely bankrupt state.
Now that Mugabe has
been toppled, the wheel
is turning, thus making
it easier for a rotation of
leaders. The people of
Zimbabwe are as hungry
as ever, eager to see
whether this thunder will
bring a fresh start during
this year’s rainy season.
