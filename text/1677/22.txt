Volunteer a few hours of your evening on November 30th to help
out at Notting Hill Community Church. The church will be opening
their doors to help feed the homeless at their “Dinner Club”
. As the
temperature drops more and more people are visiting the “Dinner
Club” to get a warm meal and the church need all the help they can
get. For more information email volunteering@imperial.ac.uk or visit
the Students’ Union Website.
