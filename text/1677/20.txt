and peanut butter cereals.
While it was extremely
sweet the hazelnut milk
balanced it out to an extent
making it quite moreish.
Although I enjoyed it (I
mean who doesn’t love
cereal) at the end of the
day it was just a bowl of
cereal and for the price it
felt a bit extravagant.

W
orth the
hype? In
our digital
w o r l d ,
filled with gorgeous food
pics from Instagram,
drool-worthy food videos
on Facebook, and constant
articles on the trendiest
new places to visit, how
can we know where is
actually worth eating, and
what’s just good lighting?
To solve this new-age di-
lemma I bring you ‘Worth
the hype’ where I’ll be
checking out all the new
trendiest food places that
you’ve seen plastered all
over the internet!
A cafe just for cereal?
Really, how millennial…
So I’m sure you’ve
heard about the Cereal
Killer Cafe, a hot spot for
Instagram-worthy shots,
founded by the blatantly
hipster Keery brothers
(their chunky beards and
obsession with all things
‘90s gives it away).
Their original Brick Lane
location has had a lot of
publicity, notably for its
nostalgia fuelled décor
and its “problematically”
high pricing (for what is
essentially a cheap break-
fast staple). For many
locals it felt like a poignant
example of gentrification,
at a time when much of
east London is suffering
from a widening inequal-
ity gap. Ultimately this
disconnect led to massive
protests along Brick Lane,
cumulating with red paint
being thrown at the café
expansion, endless Insta-
gram shots, and numerous
articles enticing tourists to
visit the cafe, the product
must be great, right?
I went to check out the
original Brick Lane cafe
to see if it really is ‘Worth
the hype’.
First impressions
Upon entering the
cafe I was overwhelmed
with the bright colours
of cereal boxes stacked
on the walls, and the en-
ergetic atmosphere of the
young tourists grinning
with the prospect of their
sugary ‘meal’. Looking
around, I was intrigued to
find a portrait of Dexter
made entirely of Cheerios
hanging on the wall – who
knew that art and cereal
could go so well together!
Behind the counter where
the ‘chefs’ were busy pre-
paring the bowls were the
numerous boxes of cereals
you could choose includ-
ing American classics
such as Lucky Charms,
Fruity Pebbles and
Captain Crunch, as well
as seven (!) different types
of Cheerios. A chalkboard
on the wall next to the
counter lists the ‘cereal
cocktails’available, which
are essentially suggested
combinations of cereals,
including toppings and
milks. However there
is an option to mix and
match and make your
own creation. I decided
to create my own bowl:
Reese’s puffs and the
Penguins of Madagascar
cereal (essentially coco
90s pop culture contained
in one room. There were
old school television
sets lining the walls with
FRIENDS video tapes
playing on them, posters
of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, actual Cabbage
Patch Kids on top of
shelves, and random
obscure toys which I’m
sure some ‘90s geeks
would freak out over.
Finally we settled down
into our seats, which
were in fact single beds,
evoking the feeling of
being in your childhood
bedroom.
The Food
Having calmed the
waves of induced nos-
talgia I decided it was
time to actually try my
creation. Fortunately milk
is served on the side in a
little glass bottle so there
were no worries of soggy
cereal. I poured about
half of my milk onto my
extremely chocolatey
combination and took
my first spoonful. I could
almost feel the sugar rush
as I crunched down on the
combination of chocolate
The best breakfast? Undoubtedly cereals! But what happens when they are the only item on the menu? Let Felix
tell you about this trip to cereal world.

After ordering we took
our bowls downstairs to
the larger part of the café.
It felt like an explosion of
Worth the Hype?
