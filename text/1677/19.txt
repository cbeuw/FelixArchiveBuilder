urrently, the
people of Los
Angeles are
losing their
minds over a new pop-up
gallery called the Happy
Place. Situated in the Arts
District in Downtown LA,
the place offers a perfect
opportunity to forget
about your everyday
problems and promises to
put a smile on your face.
The project also prides
itself on providing many
cool selfie spots, which is
indeed a clever trick to at-
tract a younger crowd and
get them to post photos
with relevant hashtags to
draw even more visitors.
For just under $30,
the visitors can enjoy
13 themed rooms, each
boasting unique attrac-
tions and installations. For
example, you can find a
huge rainbow and a pot
of gold that you can jump
into. Remember those
childhood days, when
jumping into a ball pit was
all we needed for happi-
ness? I bet it would still
be fun but doing that as
an adult might be frowned
upon. Well, worry not –
the Happy Place has no
age restrictions so you
can jump away into a pot
of soft gold coins and feel
young again.
Another attraction
in the gallery allows
visitors to lie in colourful
confetti and make confetti
angels. And how can you
get upsetti when you’re
rolling in confetti? Since
it almost never snows
in southern California,
this also presents a rare
opportunity for the locals
to experience the joy of
making snow angels.
To add to the happiness,
there’s also a glass dome
where you can enjoy a
confetti storm.
The Happy Place
wouldn’t be truly happy
without delicious snacks.
Luckily, the organizers
got that covered – the
visitors can enjoy cake
pops, ice cream, and even
rainbow-coloured grilled
cheese. What’s more, a
couple of 7-foot-tall high
heels made of M&M’s,
though not edible, make
a perfect background for
a squad photo. It’s even
possible to stand inside
of them! There’s also a
kiss-themed room with
shiny XO-shaped instal-
lations and a red lip sofa,
which again seem to be
targeted at young people
– many will inevitably
post pictures all over their
social media, blessing the
project with even more
publicity. Similarly, in a
bright yellow room with
a cosy bathtub and walls
made of rubber ducks,
there’s nothing you can
do but to get into that
bathtub immediately and
take some bomb selfies
with the ducks in the
background. You paid for
this so might as well.
But wait, that’s not all!
The gallery also contains a
room with the furniture on
the ceiling, which creates
an illusion of you being
upside-down; the Super
Bloom exhibition, made
of 15,000 flowers; and
the mirror room, which
allows you to observe
yourself from many dif-
The pop-up became a
huge deal even before it
officially opened its doors
on20thNovember,andthe
first week’s tickets were
already sold out by the
opening day. It’s sched-
uled until 7th January
2018, so if you’re visiting
California for the winter
break, you might want to
check it out. Though $30
isn’t super cheap, there’s
nothing wrong with
treating yourself during
the holiday season, espe-
cially after a challenging
term.
But let’s be honest
– many of us won’t
spend our Christmas in
California. So can we
still experience the Happy
Place? It’s not unrea-
sonable to expect that
being called a pop-up it’ll
eventually start popping
up in other large cities in
the United States or even
internationally, should the
project receive enough
success and publicity. One
can only hope it’ll arrive
to London sometime,
though very many US
projects stay within the
country, while the UK
does its own thing. I have
to admit – once I saw the
Happy Place in a vlog
of a youtuber I follow,
I immediately wished I
was in LA again, which
I visited 2 months ago. I
caught myself thinking
that people in the US have
so many more opportu-
nities and more access to
cool events/things/etc.,
which may never reach
Europe. And this made
me realize how often we
concentrate on what we
don’t have and how much
better our lives could be,
instead of appreciating
what’s already around us.
After all, happiness comes
from within, and we all
have the power to create
our own Happy Place,
especially once we realize
how much we already
have to be grateful for. So
stay strong and positive
throughout the difficult
study period, even with
the upcoming exams and
deadlines, and don’t let
anything or anyone mess
with your Happy Place!
“There’s
nothing you

“So stay strong
and positive
throughout

study period,
and don’t let
anything or
anyone mess
with your
Happy Place!”
