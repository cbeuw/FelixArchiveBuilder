Christmas is a really fucking awful time of
year
Grumpy Bastard argues that Christmas only makes us poorer, unhappier, and more
uncomfortable.

I
hate a lot of things.
Hate is a strong word,
but it neatly describes
how I feel about a
plethora of experiences,
objects and people that I
endure on a daily basis. Or
possibly extreme disgust.
I’ve even begun discern-
ing the different forms of
hatred I feel. Gnawing,
aching hatred at things
you can’t change, such
as people inexplicably
voting Labour, but with-
out enough conviction to
properly win an election. I
experience burning hatred
at couples on public trans-
port. I have no objection
to people experiencing
happiness, but when that
happiness is of a private
nature and clearly restrict-
ed to the blissful pair, I
would prefer it if I were
not cornered like a rat in
a cage and forced into
becoming an unwilling
third wheel.
Christmas does not
inspire either of these
forms of hatred within
me. It is something I am
resigned to, a holiday
that everyone will try
and make me enjoy and
inevitably I will not.
I start hating Christ-
mas early, just as the
first posts from people I
despise on social media
appear, normally of
the form “only x many
days til’ Christmas”,
in the middle of July.
Quite frankly Sharon, I
don’t give a fuck. The
only reason I haven’t
unfriended you yet is so
I can feel smug at the
shallow and vaccuous
life you lead. I harbour
hatred for the way
Christmas creeps into
our shops, like some kind
of gaudy, glitter covered
mould. The earliest I’ve
discovered Christmas
themed merchandise so
far was in August. I do
not need reminding that
the odious celebration
hijacked by Christianity
is on it’s way and will
soon be making my life
a living hell. I would
have much preferred
Saturnalia, especially as
a Roman slave.
Christmas for me,
indicates the start of
a hectic corporation
dominated spend-fest,
where the pressure to
purchase the right gift
for the right price is
cloying and omnipres-
ent. Black Friday sales
piss me off particularly.
Black Friday just shows
you that companies are
happily ripping consum-
ers off for the rest of
the year only to get us
excited about possible
“savings” and produce
some admittedly hilar-
ious videos of grown
men and women fighting
over a £200 TV screen.
Secret Santa is the best
example of everything
wrong with Christmas
consumerism: last year
I received a mug with
the handle in the shape
of an erect penis. Every
time I drink from it, the
bell-end gets alarmingly
close to my eye.
Don’t think that I
bemoan traditional
Christmas either. I
cannot testify as to how
you feel about your
families, but at best I
experience apathy, if
not downright irritation
at the prospect of being
seated around my grand-
parents. I don’t want to
endure the excruciating
details of how to use a
colostamy bag and the
enlightening chat you
had with Maureen about
painting watercolours
of horses. Please see
Sharon for my feelings
on both of these topics.
As the alcohol begins
to flow, people’s tongues
loosen and slowly but
surely, the converation
slips from a fragile peace
to violent all out war.
Accusations are thrown
too and fro, sowing the
seeds for further recrim-
inations for the future,
before the bloodied
parties have retreated to
lick their wounds. Once
Doggo doin a heckin nappo bappo// Flickr/normanack
evening arrives a false
reconciliation occurs, as
they once again cover
their true feelings with
a veneer of politeness.
This experience of
Christmas is probably
why I approach it with
such trepidation, border-
ing anxiety. This makes
Christmas shit.
I blame the illusion
of Christmas joy on
Christmas films. All
of them are forced
attempts at humour and/
or an attempt to extract
some form of emotion
from us. I haven’t been
able to watch Home
Alone without seeing
the ghost of heroin-ad-
diction future, and Love
Actually is pretty rapey.
Die Hard is an excep-
tion. Everything else
Christmassy is shit.
L
et’s assume
your claim that
exercise being
good for mental
health is true, and that it
is Imperial’s duty to deal
with this problem.
Ok. So Imperial
needs to get more people
to exercise. Anyone who
has been to the gym at
Ethos knows that at least
50% of the treadmills
are being walked on,
and at least one of the
rowing machines is
being used by someone
moving the seat up and
down under him/herself
while somehow keeping
the handle in exactly the
same place, putting pre-
cisely 0.2 calories per
hour of power through
the fan. The point is,
there is absolutely no
need to increase the
size of the gym. People
are perfectly capable of
walking all of 100m to
Hyde Park for a jog, or
even joining the cross
country club if they feel
unable to run unsuper-
vised. Indeed, I would
particularly recommend
that last one. The club is
the largest sports team at
Imperial and has a great
social scene.
We have to, of course,
spare a thought for the
minority who actually
use the gym in a mildly
wise manner. Perhaps
there should be a
treadmill walking ban,
Ethos Gym does not need to expand.
An anonymous writer argues that the gym is more than big enough, people just need to use it
properly.
or even the removal of
half the treadmills to
make way for actually
useful gym equipment.
Additionally, students
might be interested to
know that Reynolds
gym is also available to
students to use, although
they may have to interact
with the outside world
on the way there.
If you really want
to spend some of the
money Imperial has,
may I suggest investing
it in some more schol-
arships for extremely
talented students. After
all, this is a university.
