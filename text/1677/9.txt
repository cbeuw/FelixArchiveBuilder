A sleek design that

Where’s the catch? It’s a

What came first, the
Model 3 or the Falcon
Heavy?
What’s the first word
that comes to mind when
I say Tesla? Perfor-
mance, ecology? What
about delays? If you’ve
followed Tesla or SpaceX,
you’re undoubtedly aware
of a mysterious time zone
known as Elon Standard
Time™. Symptoms
include thinking the
Falcon Heavy debut
is 6 months away or
assuming the upcoming
Falcon 9 launch will
proceed without delay.
A new wave of victims
of this phenomenon (i.e.
customers) experience a
wave of euphoria quickly
followed by confusion and
profound sadness as the
Fremont factory churns
out just 50 Model 3s each
day. Moreover, most of
the initial Model 3 batch
is given to employees -
the last people we can
expect to complain should
the vehicles arrive with
any production defects.
Convenient.
It’s a rather depressing
picture brightened only
by the fact that the few
Models 3s that do find
their way to reviewers
are described as worthy
competitors to their
gas-guzzling German
counterparts. Autotrader’s
Doug DeMuro described
the small sedan as the
“The Coolest Car of
2017”, noting that it
actually offers better
value than the likes of a
BMW 340i. It remains
to be seen, however, if
that statement still holds
true when the Model 3
production finally catches
up in 2019.
Roadster as a diver-
sion tactic?
The Cambridge English
Dictionary defines a red
herring as a subject that
takes people’s attention
away from the central
point being considered.
Now for an example
of one: The 2020 Tesla
Roadster. Franz von
Holzhausen’s latest
masterpiece could not
be more eye-catching or
outrageous. Tesla’s Chief
Designer drifted the car
onto the stage, only to
present a spec sheet that
could equally as well
have been put together
by a child with no grasp
of reality. The Roadster
accelerates faster than any
car in production and with
a top speed of 400+ km/h
could easily outrun an F1
car and be highly compet-
itive among the Indy 500
field. Speaking of which,
a 200KWh battery would
allow it to complete
the legendary 500-mile
(804km) race and then
some more (1000km to be
exact, though perhaps not
at racing speed) without
being recharged.
The Tesla Roadster is
without a doubt an incred-
ible car, unprecedented
even. You’d have to be
either crazy or completely
reasonable (considering
the $200,000 price
tag along with Tesla’s
$50,000 reservation fee)
not to want one. Unfor-
tunately, while the $250
million racked up in reser-
vation fees can’t hurt, the
Roadster likely can’t turn
around Tesla’s abysmal
earnings (or lack thereof;

uled to begin production
in 2019, it will undoubt-
edly make a splash in the
trucking industry when
it finally hits the market

States, trucks account for
almost six times as much
greenhouse gas emissions
as planes do. Yet, accord-
ing to a study conducted
by Shell, the average fuel
consumption of a truck
has not budged since the
1990s. The Tesla Semi
cuts down on emissions
not only with its innova-
tive power plant, but also
with its state-of-the-art
aerodynamics that Musk
was quick to favourably
compare to the Bugatti
Chiron. Of course, any
ecological and economical
advantage of Tesla’s hy-
per-truck will inevitably
be nullified when some
asshole discovers the
Semi has enough torque
to perform burnouts.
Finding a way out of
Production Hell…
Production Hell is,
rather ironically, a term
coined by Musk himself
to describe the difficul-
ties a rapidly expanding
former start-up experienc-
es when trying to match
the production volume of
the likes of VW or GM.
Encountering production
hell was always a question
of when, not if. Overcom-

The Semi and Roadster,
meanwhile, represent
merely a welcome dis-
traction from the fears

future. That doesn’t mean
they aren’t exciting or
innovative - they are both,
pushing boundaries in
terms of range and per-
formance - but if the folks
over in Fremont can’t sort
out their production line it
could be too late.
Is Tesla too big to
fail? I don’t know. The
future is electric and is
approaching quicker than
“Big Auto” anticipated, so
Tesla is certainly backing
the right horse. Despite
numerous delays to what
is the company’s greatest
challenge yet, Elon Musk
has not yet failed to deliver
on a product. Perhaps
it’s time to approach this
megalomaniac’s expen-
sive pet project with some
cautious optimism. After
all, I would totally do a
burnout in an electric semi
truck given the chance.
