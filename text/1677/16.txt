Nai Palm lights up London with a killer solo set
F
or the first time
London had
Haitus Kyote’s
lead singer,
Nai Palm, at Koko to
perform her own solo
music in a night which
defined her new direc-
tion with music. It was
amazing just to see her
on stage, and to finally
hear her voice properly;
she truly is one of the
most impressive singers
around today.
Ellah May, alongside
her guitarist, opened
the show with a gentle
performance of some of
her originals set to rich,
chordal riffs from the
guitar. She had a very soft
voice, and sort of sat in
the same range as the gui-
tarist, which didn’t create
much impact from her
melodies. They had some
cross-rhythms between
themselves, but lacked
impact without a full band
behind, and seemed a bit
forced at some points.
Next up was Fehdah,
an Irish singer with a
massive voice and a huge
amount of energy. It was
her first show in London
and you could feel her
excitement throughout the
performance. A lot of her
songs had an Irish folk
influence to them in terms
of harmonies, which she
added to with interesting
rhythms and melodies.
The opening acts were
impressive, although it
seemed that they were
trying to emulate the
headliner’s sound (or at
least were heavily inspired
by it), only adding a few
interesting quirks to their
performances. It would’ve
been nicer to hear some-
thing that complimented
Nai Palm’s sound rather
than incorporating it to
the point where it’s hard
to differentiate between
all three of them. Re-
gardless, the show was
absolutely awesome and
if anything, the opening
acts made you appreciate
just how amazing Nai
Palm actually is.
And any issues with
the previous acts went
away when Nai Palm
touched the stage; she
came out rocking a spar-
kling leotard, a cream
Jackson flying V, and a
voice that filled the entire
venue. What was most
impressive and unique to
the live performance was
her control over her voice;
she was able to come all
the way down to a low
whisper then open her
voice up all within the
same phrase. Definitely
different from recordings
and tailored for the stage,
she sung with a lot of
power and dynamics.
Yet, the intricacies of
her voice were not lost
through the microphone;
you could still hear the
low, slightly husky tones,
sounding almost like
tenor sax at some points.
And the unity between her
guitar playing and vocals
was incredibly tight. At
points she tried to get the
audience to sing along,
which was impossible as
we were all in awe, and
the moment any number
of people joined in, she
went off on some other
beautiful melody which
shut us right up again.
The songs she per-
formed were beautiful.
It was a mix of original
pieces and covers, all
infused with crazy vocal
ad-libs. My favourite
cover she sung was of
Jimi Hendrix’s ‘Have You
Ever Been (To Electric
Ladyland)’, just after
telling us that she was
going to perform at his
house the next day. She
put the song in a different
perspective, singing it as
if she was this ‘electric
ladyland’ and wanted to
share herself, making it
more sexual than even
Jimi had intended. She
ended with her song
‘Homebody’, this slow,
melancholy tune which
sort of fitted, since
everyone was sad it was
about to be over! The
open harmonies matched
her aching lyrics and
left the audience feeling
empty; an interesting end
to one of the best singer/
songwriter performances I
had ever experienced.
Abdullah Ibrahim’s set to remember: a co-op review
L
ast Tuesday,
A b d u l l a h
Ibrahim, the 83
year old South
African father of Cape
Jazz, walked on to the
Royal Festival Hall
stage. He sat in front
of his piano, placed his
long hands on the keys,
and introduced us to the
concert with a medley
of melodies retracing
his work. The attention
of the audience was
caught for the rest of
the concert, performed
without any interrup-
tion. A certain intimacy
was established between
him and the audience as
we were accompanied
through his life story.
He takes influence from
all over the world, with
swinging rhythms and
bluesy melodies mixed in
with highlife and church
harmonies, and straight,
slightly shuffled drum
patterns. In particular, he
takes a lot of influence
from the jazz of Duke
Ellington and Thelonious
Monk. The genre is as
colourful as the nation
it comes from, and this
performance certainly
exhibited the essence of
Ibrahim’s music and what
makes him so unique.
The performance
happened as a continuous
succession of tunes that
mix together and echo
back to each other, tracing
back melodies he built up
throughout his life. He
started off by playing a
medley of pieces on his
own. Harmonically, he left
it very open with strong
dominant chords. The way
he went about playing,
including his mannerisms,
was quite laid back and
almost lethargic. Apart
from a few fast runs, it
was mostly sustained
chords with a light
melody to move between
them. And what impacted
the most was how he so
confidently would end on
a completely unresolved
and dissonant phrase, just
sitting there as if there
was nothing wrong. It is
what makes his music so
special, as this feeling of
unease will sit with you
as long as he holds those
notes.
The band entered very
subtly, with a cello and
flute easing into the piano
melody to introduce this
dark, meditative atmos-
phere. When the whole
band came in, it was
one of the tightest, most
beautiful entrances ever. A
beautiful palette of sounds
were explored with a horn
section made of an alto,
tenor and baritone saxo-
phone, a flugelhorn and
a piccolo. The baritone
added a percussive sound
to the horns and where a
trumpet would have been
too harsh, the flugelhorn
fit just right to keep the
horn section soft yet
powerful. The piccolo
(which the alto doubled
on) contrasted with its
high pitch, flying above
the solid bass lines. And
the bassist brought a
huge amount of life to the
performance, with fast
moving lines that empha-
sised the rhythm whilst
filling empty spaces. All
of them approached their
solos with a lot of inten-
sity, which fitted as they
were given a lot of space
to fill as neither the horns
or piano played behind
(for the most part).
Ibrahim left space for
the music, creating an
extremely simple and
pure scene where one
could focus all one’s at-
tention on what was being
played. Dissonances and
unresolved phrases are
scattered throughout the
development of reassuring
and beautiful melodies,
provoking both uneasi-
ness and wonder within
the audience.
It was great to see how
Ibrahim reacted to his
band. Most of the gig he
spent watching his band as
if in awe of his own work.
And once the concert was
over, he paraded them
across the stage at least
ten times, getting them to
bow at every stage. You
could see his pride in his
band and rightfully so,
as the performance was
spectacular.
Overall, it was a shiv-
er-provoking performance
which left the audience in
a reflective mood.
