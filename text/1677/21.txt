m a r k e d
Transgender Day
of Remembrance,
an annual memorialisa-
tion of those who lost
their lives as a result of
transphobic violence in
the last year.
A vigil was held in
London, among many
other cities, where the
trans community and their
allies paused to remember
Paola, who was stabbed
to death in Brazil; Mafe,
who was tortured and shot
in Colombia; Yadira, who
was strangled in Mexico;
Bianca, who was stabbed
over 20 times in the Neth-
erlands; Kenne, who was
drowned in the USA; and
another 320 trans people
who were killed in 2017
alone. The people most
targeted are trans feminine
people of colour, who are
likely to be subject to
multiple different layers
of oppression.
Exclusion, discrim-
ination, and lack of
representation put trans-
gender and gender-variant
people at risk every day,
particularly trans youth.
A recent Stonewall
survey shows that nearly
1 in 10 trans pupils have
received death threats at
school, while 84% say
they have self-harmed and
45% have tried to take
their own lives.
What I can tell you
about the situation at
Imperial is that this year
I have already received
reports of transphobic
incidents, all of which I
have taken very seriously
and acted on, and of staff
being unable to support
trans students and address
them using their preferred
pronouns.
Just last year, a
non-binary student was
reportedly grabbed by
the arms in an attempt to
forcefully eject them from
the women’s restroom of
the Reynolds Bar.
Additionally, students
who belong to more than
one minority group are
those who are margin-
alised the most in the
Imperial community, as
highlighted in the gender
equality report commis-
sioned by College and
released last year.
It’s ever so important
that we do not just memo-
rialise the people we’ve
already lost and feel sad
for those who face op-
pression on a daily basis.
We should be striving to
prevent more losses and to
help trans people thrive,
starting by educating our-
selves. And by ‘educating
ourselves’ I mean you
have to do the work. In
fact, placing the responsi-
bility to educate on trans
people is nothing more
than wilful ignorance.
It’s fundamental to
learn how to use pronouns
correctly and find ways
to avoid making assump-
tions about someone’s
gender identity based on
their gender expression.
Step two is to start
listening. Listen to trans-
gender and gender-variant
people and trust what they
say about the challenges
they have to face every
day. Do not feel entitled
to ask personal questions,
but listen when trans
people have something to
say to you.
Once you have an un-
derstanding of what issues
are facing the trans com-
munity, speaking up on
their behalf, challenging
transphobic language or
behaviour, and supporting
campaigns for equality
are all wonderful things to
do as an ally.
However, no matter
how good an ally you
become, we all have a
responsibility to keep
unlearning what we have
been taught for years, we
have to keep dismantling
the oppression we have
internalised.
Today is a good day to
start a continuing action
that has the potential to
save lives all around you.
Glossary
Transgender: umbrella
term used to describe
people whose gender
identity differs from the
sex they were assigned at
birth.
Cisgender: a term used
to describe people whose
gender identity matches
the sex that they were
assigned at birth.
Non-binary: also
genderqueer, is a catch-
all category for gender
identities that are not
exclusively masculine
or feminine — identities
which are outside the
gender binary.
Gender variant: also
gender nonconforming,
is used to describe an
individual whose gender
expression does not match
masculine and feminine
gender norms.
Transphobia: a range
of negative attitudes,
feelings or actions
towards transgender,
including non-binary, or
gender-variant people.
Here’s what I’m up
to at the moment!
M
y number one priority for
this year is to ensure Imperial
becomes a more safe,
welcoming,andinclusivespace
for transgender & gender-variant students.
In the last few months I’ve been working
to secure lasting advances for the Imperial
trans community. Action I’m taking includes:
• Bringing attention to transgender
issues in Union Council and in the
Community andWelfare Board (CWB), where
Departmental Wellbeing Representatives
also sit.
• Devising plans with the Union
President and the Deputy President
(Welfare) to advance LGBT+ inclusivity and
representation at all levels of the Union.
• Lobbying College Estates Facilities
to label as gender-neutral all single-cubicle
(accessible) toilets in all buildings.
• Reviewing key Union policies to
include non-binary people and proposing
relevant changes, which so far have
successfully been passed by the Community
and Welfare Board.
• Activelyparticipatinginthereviewof
a College’s policy draft aimed at supporting
transgender students.
• Taking seriously all of your reports
and bringing up recommendations on
how to address these issues to the Officer
Trustees and the CWB.
Collecting direct feedback from you
directly on which direction to go. This
happened first in an initial focus group
in July and I’m still regularly asking for
feedback and suggestions in Imperial LGBT+
Community (https://fb.com/groups/icu.lgbt).
Additionally, I am also researching ways
to raise awareness about gender identity,
correct use of pronouns, and the meaning
of inclusivity in the Imperial community. If
you’d like to get on board with this, please
do get in touch!
