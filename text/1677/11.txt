Our guide to the 2018 awards season contenders
Yes, the Oscars are four months away. No, we don’t care. Really.

F
all festival season
is over, trailers
for the final films
of the year have
dropped, and prestige
pictures are beginning to
roll out their wide releases
left, right, and centre. You
guessed it: it’s awards
season. While there are
strong arguments to made
that artworks shouldn’t
really be compared in
such a cut-throat way – let
alone be placed in a glad-
iatorial, fight-to-the-death
competition, hinged on
expensive gifts given by
sleazy men and women
to even sleazier men
and women over boozy
dinners – it is certainly
a satisfying feeling for
anyone who has struggled
through years of blood,
sweat, and tears to receive
recognition for their work
from audiences, critics,
and their peers alike.
More or less all of the
major contenders have
stepped up to the plate,
with only a couple left
to emerge. The tactics
behind running a suc-
cessful awards season
campaign, from marketing
and release dates, through
festival appearances and
critics screenings, is an
encyclopaedia’s worth of
words. Let’s focus instead
on who has a chance of
having their name read
out when the Oscar nom-
inations are announced on
the 23rd
of January, and,
more importantly, when
the golden statuettes are
handed out on March 4th
.
Out of the race
It is often possible
to make fairly decent
guesses at who will be
involved in the awards
conversation well over
a year in advance, based
on the reputation of a
favoured director or the
subject matter a given film
may involve. Two artists
who have strong status
amongst the Academy in
recent years are Kathryn
Bigelow and Alexander
Payne. Bigelow became
the first woman to win the
Academy Award for Best
Director for her film The
Hurt Locker, which won
six Oscars from nine nom-
inations, including Best
Picture. Three years later,
she followed this up with
the five-time nominated
Zero Dark Thirty, and
this summer she released
Detroit, another modern
historical drama. While
well-reviewed, it has not
received the same level of
unanimous praise of her
previous two, and this,
coupled with the summer
release, means that Detroit
is unlikely to register with
Downsizing attempts to
bring his unique blend
of comedy and drama to
sciencefiction,withmixed
results. The Academy will
not bite this time round.
Managing to garner the
Oscar for Best Original
Screenplay with just
her second film, Sofia
Coppola looked set to
follow in her father’s
footsteps to awards great-
ness. Since then her fare
has proved too arthouse
for the Academy. It was
thought that her latest,
The Beguiled, a remake
of a seventies Clint
Eastwood vehicle with a
distinctly feminist flavour,
could bring her back into
the winners’ circle. But
while it won her the Best
Director Prize at Cannes,
it is not carrying enough
buzz to bring further
awards attention. Similar-
ly, DarrenAronofsky, who
has at times flirted with
awards season but gener-
ally proved too gritty, will
not be in the mix with his
divisive Mother!. Critics
were split, and audiences
generally hated it.
Amazon announced
themselves as a major
awards season player last
year, with Manchester
by the Sea winning
two Oscars from six
nominations. This year
their end of year releases
were set to include You
Were Never Really Here,
Last Flag Flying, and
Wonder Wheel. The
former received universal
acclaim at Cannes, and
won the Best Actor prize
for Joaquin Phoenix
and the Best Screenplay
Prize for director Lynne
Ramsay. Amazon have
since deemed the film
too abrasive for the
tinues his mediocre col-
laboration with Amazon,
though Kate Winslet may
be in the running for a
Best Actress nomination.
From Richard Linklater,
who came close to taking
home a number of big
prizes for Boyhood, Last
Flag Flying is a sequel to
Hal Ashby’s wonderful
The Last Detail. In spite
of the strong cast, includ-
ing Bryan Cranston, Steve
Carrell, and Laurence
Fishburne, warm yet
muted reviews and box
office struggles mean that
this picture will not be in
the minds of Academy
voters. Rival Netflix has
been a lot less successful
with launching awards
campaigns due to their
apparent allergy to 90-day
theatrical windows, and
Noah Baumbach’s The
Meyerowitz Stories: New
and Selected will be lost
amidst this.
At the top of the year
it was thought that Logan
may be able to get some
play, considering its
obvious parallels with
Westerns. This excitement
seemingly stemmed from
a select group who seem
desperate for a superhero
flick to earn Oscar nods,
“While Detroit
was well-
reviewed, it’s
unlikely to
register with
Academy
voters”
Academy voters. Similar-
ly, Payne has been a staple
at the Oscars, winning the
Best Adapted Screenplay
award twice. A director
renowned for his depic-
tions of men entering
transformative existential
crises at breaking points
in their lives, Payne’s
“Netflix have
been less
successful
with awards,
due to their
allergy to 90-
day theatrical
windows”
Academy’s liking, and
pushed the release date to
February next year, ruling
it out of the running. The
latter is the latest from
Woody Allen, and con-
The Meyerowitz Stories and Killing of a Sacred Deer are unlikely to win, but I like them, so they’re going here // Netflix/A24
“New
producers A24
will be looking
to recreate last
year’s huge
success”
“Blade Runner
2049 may
do well in a
number of
technical
categories”
and has since dwindled.
Another Hugh Jackman
vehicle, The Greatest
Showman, has yet to
screen for critics. There
is very little buzz with
this one, and early word
emanating from the studio
is that it is not very good.
Amongst the furore
of fledgling production
company A24 seeing
Moonlight all the way
to a famously last-ditch
Best Picture win last
year, it was forgotten that
another of their films,
The Lobster, picked up
an Original Screenplay
nod for director Yorgos
Lanthimos. His follow up,
psychological horror The
Killing of a Sacred Deer,
picked up the very same
prize at Cannes this year;
but the small yet potent
distribution company,
hailed by many as the
saviour of cinema, seems
release in late December,
in spite of the fact that
they have removed the
disgraced Kevin Spacey
from the project and are
reshooting with original
first choice Christopher
Plummer. Scott has had
limited pull with the
Academy since his best
picture win for Gladiator
in 2000, a notable excep-
tion being 2015’s The
Martian.
Dan Gilroy’s 2014
debut Nightcrawler did
not pick up nearly as much
attention with voters as
it should have done. He
returns with a strong cast
for his sophomore effort
Roman J. Israel, Esq.,
though average reviews
mean that this one is
out of the race. David
Gordon Green’s drama
Stronger, following a
man who loses his legs
after the Boston Marathon
bombing, is lacking
awards traction in spite
of good reviews, though
Jake Gyllenhaal may
well land a long-overdue
second Oscar nomination.
Stephen Frears is the type
of director whose films
used to play well to the
Academy but no longer
resonate as the voting
pool is freshened and
diversified, sinking the
hopes of his Victoria and
Abdul.
Long shots
It was a pleasant
surprise to many when
Mad Max: Fury Road
garnered 10 Oscar nomi-
nations and won the most
of the night two years
ago. It was the best Eng-
lish-language film of the
year – along with more
traditional awards fare
Carol and eventual best
picture winner Spotlight
– and its success signalled
the Academy’s intent
to include more diverse
material. Many had
hoped that Blade Runner
2049, another revival of
a classic dystopian film of
the eighties, could repeat
that success, especially
with the in-form Denis
Villeneuve at the helm.
It is unlikely to be a Best
Picture contender, but
may do well in a number
of the technical catego-
ries, and Roger Deakins
is the favourite to win
Best Cinematography for
the first time, at a 14th
attempt. Some consider
Star Wars: The Last Jedi
as a possibility, consid-
ering Rian Johnson’s
evidently greater skill
level in comparison with
his peers who are also
directing new films in
the Star Wars franchise.
Incidentally Johnson has
just agreed to launch an
entirely new Star Wars
trilogy for Disney, signal-
ling just how highly they
rate the Looper director.
New distributor A24
had huge success last
year, and while their
efforts will be focused
on a couple of their other
releases, The Disaster
Artist could see a Best
Adapted Screenplay nod,
or director James Franco
could score a second
Best Actor nomination.
Amazon have teamed
up with Todd Haynes,
whose last film Carol
mysteriously received
six Oscar nominations
without one for Best
Picture. He returns with
Wonderstruck, another
of the period pieces he
excels with, intertwining
two narratives from 1927
and 1977 respectively. It
has reviewed well, but
not quite to the extent of
his previous masterpieces
Carol and Far from
Heaven. Margot Robbie
stars and produces I,
Tonya, a biopic about
notorious figure skating
bad girl Tonya Harding.
Regarded as a sort of
Goodfellas on ice, the pic-
ture’s best hopes hang on
Robbie for Best Actress.
Rookie company Neon
are distributing, and it
remains to be seen if they
can have a major impact
with so little experience,
in the way A24 did.
Others wearing new
hats like Robbie include
Aaron Sorkin and Andy
Serkis. Sorkin is one of
the most famous screen-
writers in the industry, and
while his directorial debut
Molly’s Game is a solid
attempt, it lacks the guile
that the likes of Danny
Boyle and in particular
David Fincher have been
able to give his written
material in the past.
Serkis is best known for
his motion capture perfor-
mances in big franchise
films, include The Lord of
the Rings, Star Wars, and
Planet of the Apes. His
first time in the director’s
chair, Breathe, sees him
bring the biographical
story of a man paralysed
from the neck down by
polio at the age of 28 to
the big screen. It is tender
but unremarkable.
Husband and wife team
Jonathan Dayton and
Valerie Faris were unable
to recapture the magic
of their wonderful debut
Little Miss Sunshine with
their sophomore effort
Ruby Sparks. Their third
film, Battle of the Sexes,
is good but not great.
Emma Stone, in the lead
as Billie Jean King, is
unlikely to retain her
Best Actress crown. Scott
Cooper helped land Jeff
Bridges a long overdue
Best Actor Oscar in 2009
with Crazy Heart, and
will be hoping to do the
same for Christian Bale
in violent Western thriller
Hostiles. It has been a box
office phenomenon, but
surely not enough to force
the hand of the Academy.
Warner are running a full
awards campaign, but bar
Sophia Lillis, who may
be able to sneak in a best
supporting actress nod, it
seems unlikely this will
stick.
We will be concluding
the predictions for this
year’s awards season in
next week’s Felix – keep
an eye out!
Blade Runner 2049 and Wonderstruck could possibly strike out at the Oscars this year // Warner Bros./Amazon
to be focusing its attention
on other projects that are
easier to sell to voters.
The Hollywood sexual
harassment and assault
scandals may have had
a knock-on effect on
awards season. The
Weinstein Company’s The
Current War opened to
dismal reviews at Toronto
anyway, and has since
been pushed to 2018 (if
TWC survives that long).
Harvey Weinstein, among
his many heinous crimes,
was a bully, capable of
forcing his pictures down
the throats of Academy
voters. In his heyday,
TWC scored back to back
best picture wins for The
King’s Speech and The
Artist (both undeserv-
ingly), and many will be
glad to rid of him. Ridley
Scott’s second film of the
year, All the Money in the
World, is still aiming for
