Boys Against Girls
any day I say), but in popular culture, which is
the metre for popular opinion, scientists a n d
accountants and engineers and computer types
are perceived to be really dull. Women can just
get away with doing something they don't like
because they have choices in their life that men
don't have. Warren Farell in his book The Myth
of Male Power summarises the possible male
and female life histories as follows:
Men: Work
Women: Work
Have Babies
Work part time and have
babies as well
( IBID p9; women are seven times
more likely to work only part-time)
The lack of pressure on Western women
has allowed them freedom to pursue goals of
self-fulfilment, not the other w a y a r o u n d .
Stability in t h e p a t r i a r c h a l h i e r a r c h y is
m a i n t a i n e d n o t s o l e l y by t h e p r o l i f e r a t e
megalomania of the male psyche, but also by
the way it enables women to have a cushy life.
They can be l o o k e d after. They a r e not
conscripted to fight in major wars, they do not
spend their lives working hard to support a
sexual partner perfectly capable of doing the
same work with the result that they live shorter
lives. Men do all the worst jobs, men have a far
higher suicide rate (dentists curiously) so it
would appear that contrary to popular opinion,
(and let's face it if it gets you laid - which it
does - it will be popular) it is m e n w h o are
oppressed and damaged by the gender roles
and not women. It would be possible to go as
far as to say that the whole system is geared
towards giving w o m e n an easy life, but that
would be hypocrisy.
The next time a women starts singing off
about what a poor lot women have in life, beat
the living shit out of her. Jtj

Let me tell you a story. Like all stories it
starts "once upon a time, in a land far, far
away ... all the men got jobs and married, and
all the women got married and pregnant.
Everyone was happy, healthy, wealthy and
wise. They'd never had it so good."
Like most fairy stories this one contains
some truth, some
make believe and
more than just a
p i n c h of wish ful-
filment. In fact the
only certainty is
contained i n the
starting phrase, 'once
upon a time'.
P o s t - w a r
employment trends
have increasingly
made such happy
families a thing of
the past. As heavy
industry has dec-
lined and infor-
mation technology has cut a swath through
middle management, the traditional preserves
of semi- and unskilled men have been lost.
Instead the fastest growing sector of the
economy is part-time jobs for women on low
wages. Whilst the Left rail on ad nausea
concerning minimum wages and the Right
as working men.
The con-
cept of 'the
underclass man',
imported from the ghettos of America, is one
that is becoming increasingly familiar in this
country too. However the job situation is only
one part of that equation. This, for men, has
acted concurrently with the increasing attrac-
tiveness of women within the job market,
particularly i n the retail section. The
widespread failure of marriage and the
acceptance of single parent families has hit
young men in more ways than one.
In the professional classes the situation
is somewhat reversed. Twenty percent of
women now earn more than their partners; a
situation w h i c h leads to their careers
dominating the social and geographic
decisions of those relationships. The current
trends for contractualisation and working
from home have also provided some men with
the opportunity to spend time with their
children, take voluntary jobs of their own or
just indulge themselves in rounds of golf.
In the future however, the standing of
women seems likely to continue to strength-
en. Girls generally gain a better education
than boys and women will continue, as a
gender, to improve their employment
prospects i n both professional and casual
spheres of work. But if they so desire they can
also chose to opt out and have children.
Maybe it's not an easy choice, but it is a
choice. If there's any trouser wearing to be
done, it will be women doing it. | J
