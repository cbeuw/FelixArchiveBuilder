Sex: the infinitely malleable continuum
HE RMS ME RMS AND FERMS
POLARITY IN THE PRESS
Between 1984 and 1994, the percentage of
female students at Imperial rose from about
17% to about 27%. Efforts go on all the time
to increase women's awareness, appreciation
and wish to study science through schemes
such as Women Into Science and Engineering
(WISE) and Women's Science
Night at the Science Museum (to
name only two).
In B r i t a i n , however, the
perception remains resolute:
science and engineering are naturally
ordained as male preserves. 47% of academic
physicists in Hungary are women; the figure
in the United States is 3%. Where has the
perception that science is for men -apparently
prevalent only in English-speaking countries
- arisen from?
Helen Haste, former president of the
psychology section of the
B r i t i s h Association for the
Advancement of Science, has a
theory to answer this question.
Her idea is that people are
reared into anxious feelings
about being "properly" male or female: very
few overlaps are acceptable. Haste sees the
male-female polarity in many different guises:
"In Western cultures some polarities have
become associated with male-female polarity:
such as public-private, hard-soft, active-
passive, rational-intuitive, thinking-feeling,
science-arts. These metaphors are not just

poetic fancies, they express u n d e r l y i n g
theories held by both lay and scientific
people." (New Scientist, 15 February, 1992)
Headlines from scientific magazines
(see box below) reveal our predilection for
expressing scientific findings in terms of
these polarised viewpoints.
Research is presented for what
it means to one group or the
other: but can we take the
divide for granted?
Professor Anne Fausto-Sterling, an
American geneticist, has written that defining
everyone as all-male or all-female may be
insufficient. Rather than using this
prescriptive terminology, she proposes three
extra sex classifications, herm, merm and ferm.
"Biologically speaking," she says, "there are
many gradations running from female to male
and one can argue that along
the spectrum lie at least five
sexes" (The Sciences, M a r c h
1993).
If it is this difficult even
to classify whether one is
technically male or female, there must even
less of a basis for the argument that women
choose not to study science because they are
naturally less scientifically talented. U n t i l
such ideas are expunged, the m y t h that
science is male w i l l live on and the real
reasons will stay comfortably hidden.
