Run-down of this week's ents
Keys: Midsummer's Carnival
W e l l , now we've recovered from our
headshaking little welcome burst of
indieness, here's this weeks pearls,
guaranteed to be more entertaining than
England's display against the might of Japan.
Friday June 9th: If you want a special
night of 'mind-expanding trance, happy
hardcore and bangin' techno', then mantra is
for you and it's all yours for just a Quid. Or
free if you're there before 9pm.
Saturday June 10th: Without my Mystic
Meg Ball, I don't know who's playing but I
do know we'll be continuing our big screen
coverage of the Rugby World Cup quarter-
finals in Da Vinci's. Bar opens at 1pm, watch
posters for full details.
Tuesday June 13th: This is going to be a
very lucky 13th for somebody, as we hold our
end of year, summer holiday, Bar Trivia.
There's £50 cash to the w i n n i n g team,
courtesy of STA Travel, plus beer and other
goodies to be won. Is there a better way to
spend a Tuesday night?
Wednesday June 14th: Still hanging on in
there... Club Spanque. 8pm - 11.30pm.
Thursday June 15th: A n evening of light
training before the main event...Cocktail
Night. Summer specials from £1.70.
Friday June 16th: What the world's been
waiting for. For those of you with you head
full of formulae who've not noticed the garish
posters, it's The Midsummers Night
Carnival. For just £5 in advance, you can
celebrate the end of the year in style, as the
U n i o n B u i l d i n g gets as close to holiday
heaven as possible without putting 2 tons of
sand in the Quad. For fans of all things
trancey, Whirl-y-gig, featuring D J Monkey
Pilot, Earthtribe, and Joi w i l l be in the
concert hall, and quieter types may fancy the
chilled out ambience of the Malibu Cocktail
Bar, with cool cocktails and chilled sounds. If
you want to get wet and w i l d , the Ents
Lounge turns into a bubbletastic Foam Party,
on a Balearic tip. Y o u can also try not to
"wipeout" on the SurfMachine, limbo away to
the Steel Band, "oooh" and "aaah" at the
Circus Acts, stuff yourself at the Barbecue, or
just make yourself sick on the free " B I Z Z "
soft drinks, and Candyfloss. A n d someone
will be going home with a surfboard! There's
also special gifts for those in beachwear.
Ticket are on sale in the Union Office, but we
expect to sell out, so don't leave it too late.
It's going to be hot, hot, H O T !
A final thing... if you want to stand a
chance of w i n n i n g £150 worth of travel
vouchers, fill in an I.C.U questionnaire and
return it to the Union Office or S T A Student
Travel, before 5pm next Friday (16th).
