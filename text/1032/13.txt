O welcome to weirdsville
The power of documentaries has
always been grounded in the
understanding that they are fact. In
documentaries, the people who talk
to the camera say their lines as
themselves: no characterisations
are involved. But that power always
involves a double-edge; something
evidenced in c r u m b - a docu-
mentary about the underground
artist Robert Crumb.
Some parts of the film are
unsurprising in their factuality.
Crumb, the geeky, speck ridden
artist, sketches continually and
compulsively. Even when being
interviewed in a restaurant, he
draws over the paper napkin.
We get to hear about the
experiences he had in the sixties,
when his influence was strongest.
Ex-lovers and wives swan into view,
expressing mock anger over the
way he treated them and Robert
just raises his shoulders and laughs
soundlessly. Robert Hughes, the
gruff culture critic, tries to raise
Crumb to the canon of great art
and fellow cartoonists discuss
whether he's a racist, a misogynist,
a genius, a sell out or a loser. We
see him doing a photo shoot for
'Leg Show' magazine; him and a
bevy of lovelies. The editor, another
ex, waxes lyrically about his sexual
habits - uninterested in bed,
obsessed by masturbation, excited
by piggy-backsl
It's all quite standard docu-
mentary stuff really. Some infor-
mation is imparted and something
of Crumb's strange character is
displayed. If the documentary was
made up totally of this type of
material it would remain a worthy,
yet boring film, purely one for the
graphical train-spotters.
Tragically though this isn't the
case and it's this twist of the factual
knife which makes the film so
compelling. Because behind the
facade of the professional
commentators loom the three
Crumb brothers and, for all their
sad weirdness, it's an enthralling
sight. For the Crumb family was,
and what remains of it still is, an
example of the two sides of the
american dream/nightmare.
Father was an authoritarian
marine who wanted his sons to be
blond, strapping lads. What he got
was three dysfunctional geeks, as
well as two daughters (neither of
which appear in the film, one being
a 'separatist lesbian'). Mother was a
tranquilliser addict and the boys,
Charles, Robert and Max grew up
and atrophied within their own little
world of hand-drawn comics.
Older brother, Charles, gives
gummy smiles (sans teeth) and tells
tales of his mental illnesses, the
medication that stops him wanting
to commit suicide, reclusehood and
the continual rereading of the
books of his youth, and it's
compelling. One because he's real,
two because he's actually funny,
three because it's incredibly sad
and four because Charles is aware
of all these things too. In a similar
way Max gets out his bed of nails
and sits on it, swallows qualities of
cotton to clean out his gut and tells
of the urges that saw him jailed for
pulling women's trousers down.
In turn it doesn't take too much
of this before you realise where
Robert's art is coming from. The

In a wild and wacky week; tintin keeps on truckin' with king
of underground comics, Robert Crumb in the documentary
crumb. Magpie endures the charms of the brady bunch.
In space no-one can hear you scream, on rotation they don't
stop you spinning until you ask them nicely. Luke Gietzen and
Joe McFadden muse over the week's singles.
paul weller bring it all back home - Nick goes too. Joe hears
the new future sounds of london album and says yes, Nick
returns with teenage fanclub live before fan is surprised by
boy george. Vik brings up the rear with steamboat band.
The 227th Royal Academy of Art summer exhibition is the
setting for over a thousand exhibits from established artists
and random newcomers. Tintin mingled with the crowd.
The ever popular classic book column continues for an
IpjjJ unprecedented second week as Samin sings the praise of
Umberto Eco's reflections on the name of the rose.
crazy have always told us more
about society than the sane and
seeing it demonstrated in Crumb
turns out to be an intensely
disconcerting experience.
Let's set the cringe worthy
scene: the b r a d y b u n c h have
somehow evaded time. They have
neither grown old or changed with
the times. Maybe it's an alien
abduction or some genetic
experiment. Whatever, this family
has landed in the nineties and they
are completely oblivious to their
new surroundings.
Well, until that oblivion is
rudely interrupted by the small
matter of a $20,000 property tax.
The Brady Bunch face eviction (cue
audience tears) and the auctioning
off of their house. And if that
weren't enough the individual
members of the family are facing
their own personal problems;
puberty, dating, middle child
syndrome, inner voices. It's all very
worrying, it really is.
If you are unfortunate enough
to see this film then watch out for
the star guests. Ru Paul plays a
school counsellor in one of the
more amusing scenes, and then
there are three quarters of the
Monkeys (Davy Jones, Peter Tork
and Micky Dolenz). It's small
comfort I know.
From start to finish The Brady
Bunch had me cringing in my seat
with embarrassment. It will also
embarrass and haunt every
thirtysomething who remembers
polyester shirts and flared trousers,
and those still wearing them today.
Burlesque it is not, a turkey it
is. This film is best seen, and I
quote, "stoned and on video". Â©
