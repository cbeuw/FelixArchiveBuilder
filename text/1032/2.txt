News In
Brief
New Group
A new environmental law and
management group at Imperial
has been launched. Sponsored by
Denton Hall, an international
law firm, the joint partnership
will work closely to help address
the need for better technical
ability i n practising environ-
mental law.
Since the U K ' s adoption of
the Environmental Protection
Act of 1990, the number o f
environmental lawyers in this
country has grown from 40 to
over 1200. T h i s has occurred
despite the fact that there has not
been a proportionate rise i n
relevant cases.
"Lawyers need to under-
stand the scientific options, as
well as the legal issues", says
John Salter, head o f the
environmental law group at
Denton Hall. "Businesses expect
their solicitors to set their legal
advice in a technical context."
The group hopes to work
closely on subjects such as bio-
technology and biodiversity,
fraud and crime, contaminated
land and pesticides. The init-
iative w i l l see D e n t o n H a l l
partners teach at Imperial and IC
academics speak at the law firms
training courses. Students may
benefit as they w i l l have the
opportunity to understand the
true implications of environ-

mental law for business and to
assess issues of environmental
policy and the law.
MSc Students at the I C
Centre for Environmental Tech-
nology will be offered a specialist
option in environmental law and
management.
Penney Saved
A break-in at the department of
computing was aborted in the
early hours o f last Friday
morning. Security were alerted
when the newly installed infra-
red detectors sent alarms off.
They gave chase to two
youths seen running away from
the broken window. Two men
detained shortly afterwards on
K e n s i n g t o n H i g h Street are
awaiting charge, awaiting police
forensic results from the
fingerprints taken from the
broken glass.
The men attempted to break
into the W i l l i a m Penney
b u i l d i n g from the Sherfield
walkway, and although I C
security found a word processor
on the window-ledge, nothing
was stolen from the department.
A computer was stolen and three
others were damaged during a
similar, but more successful raid
on the W i l l i a m Penney
laboratory last month.
Terry Briley, Deputy Head
of Security, said he was
encouraged that the new security
measures were proving to be
effective. Praising the quick
reaction of the security guards
involved, he said "I'm pleased
with my people".

Well it's thursday afternoon, I'm
late with pages, so it must be
time to write an editorial. I
remember my dream of editorial
writing before I became editor
- the great social commentaries
and the shaking fist at the
Sherfield building. The reality
has been somewhat less flam-
boyant and i n fact I have a
confession to make: I've never
found more than twenty minutes
for this regular event. This is not
a boast, I'm sure you will find it
pretty easy to believe. I guess it's
some sort of belated apology.
Sex
Sexism and feminism and grubby
old men, I dunno. O n the one
hand I think that some women
are prone to use the feminist
argument as a rather noble but
ill-considered argument about
the problems of life in general.
Why can't IX, why do we Y? But
on the other hand, women
certainly have to overcome
hurdles that us males can't really
appreciate.
One of the simplest of these
is sexual harassment. I went
through a period a couple of
years ago where I endured several
run-ins with gay men: one who
climbed over a toilet cubical wall
whilst I was using it (yeah, haha)
and another who I'm pretty sure
was about to assault me had me
leaping in front of a taxi. I've had
to consciously avoid becoming
homophobic, as women balance
Drink Report
Recent figures comparing
Student Union alcohol consump-
tion nationwide put Imperial
College Union drinkers towards
the bottom of the league. The
comparison o f how much is
spent per student predictably
leaves isolated campus univer-
sities scoring highly, but even
amongst a comparison of city-
centre institutions Imperial
students spend less on alcohol.
The results have led senior
academics to emphasise that
excessive d r i n k i n g here is a
problem only for a noisy
minority. Others have speculated
that the figure is surprisingly low
because the IC Union bars face
stiff competition from Southside
bar.
'a few dodgy blokes' with their
idea of men I suppose.
Still, I have little sympathy
for those who explain to me in a
leather miniskirt that men don't
take them seriously. Anyone who
sexualises the everyday environ-
ment (and no, we don't need to
be covered from head to toe -
men aren't) cannot complain if
someone comments o n their
appearance.
A girl I know wears high
heels because 'men don't take her
seriously otherwise'. But why
aren't people brave enough to be
themselves rather than a sex?
