Some men hove to get completely slaughtered
before they dare a p p r o a c h a w o m a n Fair
enough, some of us are shyer than others. But
is it necessary to be drunk to the extent where
the girl concerned feels sexually harassed and
is afraid to go out in case it happens* again?
I've never heard my male friends comptdjri they
have been groped by a stranger in the bar...
The m a l e / f e m a l e m i x a t IC is. a b i t
unusual - perhaps our social situation provokes
that sort of behaviour. Somehow though, I think
it's a more fundamental problem. I've been
hassled myself whilst out around London more
times than I can count on my fingers. Smiles
and wolf-whistles don't bother me at all - they
are positive gestures that can brighten up your
day. But u n w a n t e d physical contact? From
strangers? I think not.
Recently I've had a couple of really nasty
experiences. Oddly enough, in both cases the
male was somewhat one over the eight. I don't
think I'm prone to scaremongering, nor do I
dress outrageously or walk home alone in the
dark. But at 7 a m o n a Sunday m o r n i n g in
Covent Garden, surrounded by people, should I
feel scared when someone who seems friendly
enough starts chatting me up? O r when three
of us a r e w a l k i n g d o w n H a m m e r s m i t h
Broadway on a Friday night - a main road, well-
lit - and an alcoholic starts trying to grab us? It
might not sound like m u c h , but I have felt
emotionally scarred ever since.
Obviously there are a lot of reasons why
sexual harassment like this occurs. It's not
funny trying to figure them out when you're in
that situation. Yes, there are perverts out there
who get their kicks out of terrifying others. But
I've noticed that all the men who've tried it on
with me were perfectly decent blokes when not
drunk. Why do certain males find it necessary
to act like this w h e n d r u n k ? I m m a t u r i t y ?
Inadequacy? O r primeval 'male' behaviour?
Guys - when you read this - please just
take some time to stop and think about the way
you act. By all means have a drink and enjoy
yourselves, but don't lose control over what you
are doing. You may think you are just having a
bit of harmless fun, but I bet you've never been

In Imperial College there are three
female professors - yet throughout the
country women are consistently getting better
grades in school. Social leaders and personnel
management are almost exclusively male -
even though women are commonly (rightly or
wrongly) accredited with a far better
understanding of people. Over 50% of the
population is female - yet birth and
menstruation are unacceptable conversation
topics. Far more than 50% of television
viewers are female, yet producers and
directors (nearly all male) write and film for
the male perspective -
one that is frequently
patronising and offensive.
A d v e r t i s i n g
executives have only two
types of women in their
ads: the 'executive tart' or
'two cunts in a kitchen'.
Over 50% of us are female
but history books are
exclusively male; Jessie Bernard, a"n*
established academic, points out that
practically all sociology to date has been a
sociology of the male world. Males have taken
themselves as the reference point, assessed
problems and determined priorities from
their perspective and then proceeded to
conduct their research and construct their
sociological knowledge on these most
subjective and unquestioned premises - an
exclusion of female meaning. Over 50% of us
are female - but this workforce, these
consumers, these civilians with equal rights to
independence still live a second-class life. The
concept that the need for feminism is a thing
of the past, that everything is alright now,
could fairly be described as a sop fed to us by
a male-dominated society protecting their
own backs.
As a person I am still seen primarily
as female - and boxed accordingly. Society
classes me according to dress - frump or tart.
This doesn't happen to men. Society does not
allow me to walk down the street without
harassment - i f I object it brands me as
having no sense of humour or becomes
abusive. Society has
never recognised women
as thinking, dynamic, strong people capable
of leadership, and still doesn't. Y e t i n
Western history women have been taught to
protect their men from the realities of life -
women coped with pregnancy alone and were
shut away to do so. F a m i l y illness was
handled by women. Unwanted pregnancies
and physical disasters were all handled by
women. Often the financial running of the
household was handled by the woman, who
consistently protected her man from trouble.
Men were not to be told about anything that
could upset them and women, as they still do,
bore the brum of the problem and tended to
the man's needs.
Imperial College pats itself on its
managerial head for hosting an annual WISE
week - while i n the meantime the senior

throughout college, staff who are known to
have harassed female students are kept in
position, kept in contact with first years and
given female tutees. Female students are
commonly i n receipt of letters from male
lecturers suggesting relationships, and then
are expected to turn up to tutorials and s u k
out this person for academic advice. A n d
these women, again taught by society to
consider these men's feelings as of paramount
importance, are afraid to speak out. Not
because of fear of personal exposure, but due
to this ingrained idea that we cannot cause a
man trouble but must instead protect him
from it.
In the light of a l l this I find it
increasingly difficult to accept that the battle
is won, that women are accepted as an integral
part of society. I admit that men have also

been boxed inside an
emotional stereotype - but
that is one that can change without
challenging the shape of society. What men
have been given is independence and
ambition - creative and mental stretching and
the potential for advancement - continual
challenges, something new. Probably the
most damaging box a woman is put in is the
one that says it is what she looks like that
determines her level of acceptance - whether
she is listened to, respected and her opinions,
even her self, valued. And the difficulty with
this is that what she is supposed to look like is
'feminine' - a word defined by males to mean
gentle, pretty and generally Laura Ashley.
This inherently excludes women from any
position of power or authority, i f only by
impracticalities of dress!
This image is propagated by a male;
advertising world, a male film world, male-
oriented authority figures. Male historians
have deprived me of role models, again
propagating the belief that women can never
be great. Male critics, who naturally do not
relate to the experiences of female artists,
writers, film directors and musicians, have
unwittingly prevented their recognition, thus
depriving me of another huge part of my
heritage. More damaging is that female
perspectives of female potential is not pub-
licised, again relegating women to the role of
tart or mother

Reading most
a c c l a i m e d
books, the dif-

portrayal of
women by wo-
men or by
men is enor-

males (of the same background - this affects
class and race), just as male critics are biased
to male art. There is, then, a need for positive

uaily has to be twice as
half as far (although it
has been said that this is not difficult...). For
Margaret Thatcher to be a leader she became
branded 'the Iron Lady', a derogatory term
denoting her loss of 'femininity' - okay, I
have problems with her policies, but she was
an excellent leader. T o be this good, to get
this far, why should we have to become 'like a
man'? There are strengths i n female culture
that are generally not present in male culture
that need to be present i n
leadership situations - the
ability to talk about feelings for
example. Maybe if women were
put i n these positions men
could, by association, become
released from their own
emotional boxes. But, looking at
the facts, this time is still a long
way off. T o o many men, i n
short, have a problem with
being under the authority of
a woman. It is this ego that
stands i n the way of our
ultimate freedom.
"If a woman recognises that the only way
women can ever live in real dignity is to make this
society a place where both men and women can
share its responsibilities and rewards equally, then
she must commit herselfto the struggle for women's
freedom. Coming to grips with this is very difficult.
Even now, I feel resentment that my choice is

The point that critics of this simple brand

consistently miss is that for the moment at least,
it wouldn't matter two hoots if a few super-boy-
bimbo's appeared on billboards everywhere.
Because men could simply open any qualiiy

grey squared mostly-male faces: running the
country, making the best deals, inventing and

or hag) If we're serious about 5 0 - 5 0 m e n -
