A wry smile must have crossed
paul w e l l e r ' s lips when he
penned the first track of his latest
album, Stanley road. Weller is
indeed a 'changingman'. From the
Jam and Style Council to today the
modfather has certainly altered his
musical direction.
'Changingman', the track,
opens 'Stanley road' and it's a
stomping song which is one of the
album's best. A ballad, 'you do
something to me', then shows off
Weller's chocolate voice as it
changes from contemplative to
rocky during the song. 'Time
passes' is another ballad in the
same vein but before too long you
start to realise that "the same" is a
phrase which casts a long shadow
over the album. Yes, Weller can
play, I don't deny that, but the
album as a whole is better suited
to midnight background music
rather than upfront non-passive
listening. The songs only seem to
have two faces - loud or quiet -
and they either start with a clanky
guitar sound or a piano break.
'Wings of speed' includes a
some gospelesque singing which
adds originality to the closing

track, but Weller is in danger of
pushing the aor routine a little too
far. Despite being the darling of
the NME, he may indeed have to
re-invent himself once more to
regain what he has lost. (6)
There's a five second snatch of
sampled speech at the start of
isdn, the future s o u n d s of
london's epic new album, where
the creators break their rule of
invisible performances and speak
directly to the audience. What do
they have to say to the punters?
"Stop flashing those f'king lights
please" And that's it.
The rest of the album is a
seamless soundscape of cybernetic
cool with samples from 'aliens'
and 'repoman' serving as the
vocabulary for a post-modern
conceptless album. Meaning
disappears over the event horizon
and you're left simply to sink into
sensation. This is music in its
truest, purest sense.
Motifs repeat, fade and return
in transmuted form during this
seventy minute journey. I might
compare it to classical music, but I
don't know enough to do more
thrown together in a very
haphazard way to little effect.

t e e n a g e f a n c l u b wander
onto the Shepherd Bush Empire
stage in their customary manner to
a wall of clapping and whistles.
With no further ceremony, they
kick off with 'hang on', followed
quickly by 'what you do to me'. By
this time, the moshers are in full
mosh and the atmosphere is
brilliant. Every single track is filled
with the enthusiasm the band
demonstrate each time they play
live. Then TFC storm through 'the
cabbage', 'commercial alternative'
and other from their previous and
current albums. The hour long set
finishes with the sublime 'star sign'
and we're into encore land.
First cover version is the
Beatles' 'rain', followed by 'the
concept'. Encore number two
consists of covers so obscure no-
one had heard of them. In a mosh
of feedback and strobe lights, TFC
finish and wander off as they came
on. The best band in Britain?
boy george is back with an
album that touches on aspects of
his life and also takes a new
musical direction, leaving behind
the old days of Culture Club.
cheapness and beauty opens
with 'funtime' (Iggy Pop/Bowie)
and progresses on through a fair
number of guitar laden tracks.
Another remarkable thing about it
is how personal the themes are.
George defends his sexuality from
society, attacks past lovers as well
as talking about cheapness, beauty
and misadventure.
With anyone else this material
would probably just end up angry
and loud. George, however, seems
to be content to lead you through
the pages of his public life. A good
example is 'unfinished business'.
It's about an ex lover and is sung
emotionally, without resorting to
shouting match.
Boy George has pulled off a
very pleasant surprise with this
album and while he may not be a
cool name to throw around, you
should give this a chance. (8)
I so wanted to like the
steamboat b a n d . After all, it's
not every day that a band from
your home town, who have played
your local pub, release a major
label Ip; runners and riders. Alas,
no. Within the first few chords of
opening track, three ugly (to some)
words slap you across the face; the
Black Crowes. This wouldn't
necessarily be a bad thing if it
weren't for the fact that the world
is only big enough for one lot of
Rolling Stones purloiners. Copying
the pioneers is one thing, copying
the copyists is quite another.
The moral of the story is that a
rock band who play in their local
pub often ends up playing pub
rock. (4) 0
