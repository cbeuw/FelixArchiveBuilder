Excessive Drinking5
to be Curbed
Imperial's senior academics are
looking at measures to curb
excessive drinking on campus.
Alan Swanson, Pro-Rector (Edu-
cational Quality) presented a
paper to the house committee on
Tuesday to express his increas-
ing concern. "I have no doubt
that some students are spending
more money and time on drink
than is good for them," he said.
In response, the committee
are pressing for a new campaign
to heighten awareness of the
dangers of alcohol. T h e y are
calling for a clampdown on beer
promotions during the day, as
well as a review of the bar
extensions policy during term-
time. In a report that also exp-
resses concerns of problem
drinking amongst staff, D r Alan
Swann, IC Occupational Health
Advisor, said that the problem
drinking 'exists at a level where
action is needed.' B u t he
admitted that the college
response should not be 'unnec-
essarily punitive towards the
many for w h o m alcohol is a
safely-used social relaxant.'
Gareth Jones, IC Senior
Tutor, endorsed proposals to
raise awareness of the problems.
"I've been concerned for some
time about the effects on
students of excessive drinking,"
he said. "I've seen quite a
number of students who have got
into difficulties, and it's sad."
Describing cases where students
have got into difficulties that are
'financial, behavioural, as well as
getting into trouble with the
law,' he said. "I would not be
surprised i f we have a worse
problem here than i n other
universities."

A quiet day: but is excessive drinking a real problem at Imperial College?
Holland Club in Doubt
B Y T H E N E W S T E A M
The future of the Holland Club,
Imperial Colleges social club for
non-academic staff, is in doubt.
However, Brian Devlin, Imperial
College Credit controller and
H o l l a n d Club treasurer, has
dismissed fears that its future is
uncertain, despite the latest nine-
month accounts which showed a
net deficit of £13,000. Blaming
the club's financial difficulties on
staff problems, M r D e v l i n
commented that the club was
'hoping to see an improvement
from now on.'
The worrying financial
report comes on top of an £8,000
loss for the same period last year,
leaving the Holland Club with
reserves of only £2,000.
"We were unfortunate in that
the bar steward wasn't up to
scratch," M r Devlin claimed. The
Holland Club has been beset with
problem bar managers in recent
time. One bar steward left at the
beginning of the current aca-
demic year amid allegations that
he had been stealing from the
club, whilst another steward
lasted for only one half-year
probationary contract. According
to the treasurer's report, he cost
the club £7,000 for the six months
he was employed. "Certain
members of the committee didn't
like Duncan," one Holland Cub
member commented, "But a lot of
the committee don't like each
other either."
K e v i n Y o u n g , a former
Imperial College U n i o n bar
steward, has taken over the
position. "We anticipate that [he]
will make a positive difference,"
M r D e v l i n said. " T h e staff
problem is hopefully sorted...
and," he insisted, "we can absorb
the-loss we've made."
