The Muslim Voice... The drug law-makers are off their heads...

Dear Felix,
Over the past couple of weeks, the
evil weed has appeared as front
page news in Felix. I thought I'd
better clarify some points.
1) Smoking cannabis may cause
cancer, but so can cigarettes and
alcohol, and they're legal.
2) 80% of students at IC smoke (or
have smoked) cannabis (according
to Mr Reynolds, Head of Security).
3) In Mr Briley's (Deputy Head of
Security) words, the use of
marijuana is no worse than the
excessive use of alcohol often seen
on campus. Drinking clubs, are
you listening?
4) Cannabis users are considerably
less violent and aggressive than
someone after eight pints. I
challenge anybody to try and beat
someone up after a few spliffs!
So if all these points are true, and I
suspect they might just be, then
the current law on cannabis is
outdated, clearly uniformed and
WRONG! Twenty years on, things
will change as 80% of students
become 80% of politicians but I
can't wait that long. So, Sir Ronald,
if you're reading this, GIE'S PEACE!
PS Thank God I'm not living in
halls this year, Big Brother or
what?
P.PS As for the argument against
cannabis, in that it induces
memory loss... sorry, I've
completely lost my train of
thought.

Cannbis, like all drugs, has both
benefits and side effects. I am
always amused that cannabis is
compared favourably to tobacco,
but cannabis is often smoked with
tobacco anyway, thus making the
argument moot.
I won't attempt to gain the high
moral ground, as I myself have
partaken of the 'evil weed' in the
past. But excessive use of ANY drug
is bad for you!
I agree with Mr A. User as I
believe the law should be changed,
as it would reduce the amount of
organised crime based on drugs. It
would also make the job of
charities and organisations dealing
with drug addiction easier. But let's
face it, the current government is
highly unlikely to facilitate such a
change in the law, unless they were
sure they could make lots of money
from it. This seems to be the only
driving force behind legislation
these days.
Change to
Islam
Dear Felix,
I note with interest some of the
comments made by Alan Bailey,
(Mech Eng post grad.) about
student attitudes (Felix Issue No
1030) and other way it should be.
He proclaims that our political
views should be voiced and action
taken to change the world we live
in. The fact of the matter is that the
system which rules does so in
tyranny. When was the last time
government changed policy as a
direct result of public opinion? If
you wish to refer to the poll tax,
well, it's now become the wolf
dressed in sheep's clothing in
order to subdue and pacify the
citizens.
As the commenting editor, Piers
Daniell, said it is the system which
needs to be and can be changed
but not individuals and individual
policies. Well done, Sir. At last,
someone has come to the same
conclusion that Muslims worldwide
have been and still are rallying
and campaigning for. But when it
comes to students and their
participation in politics, be they
local or global politics, it seems
that Muslim students are excluded
from this general category of
students who should and can
participate. I would like to remind
readers that we Muslims constitute
a significant proportion of the
student body and thus should be
encouraged, not repressed
whenever we voice our concerns,
opinions and ideals. I refer to the
incidents of the past three years of
my time at Imperial during which I
have witnessed many bannings
and cancellations of talks which
were considered radical but of
high priority to Muslims on campus
and worldwide. The Union (ICU)
has a bigoted policy of freedom of
speech and expression which is
biased towards all groups of
people but Muslims. The overall
role of ICU seems too
authoritarian rather than
democratic or diplomatic. I would
be naive indeed to imply this
attitude to be solely attributable to
ICU: it is merely a reflection of the
political organisation of the so-
called democratic state we live in.
Democracy is only ever
experienced by voting citizens of
democracy during the few
exhilarating moments of casting
vote. After that, we have no say.
Essentially, we are free to choose
the tyrants we wish to have rule
over us for the next few years.
Under such circumstances, it is no
surprise that students, who are
often impoverished, have no wish
to waste their efforts on causing
insignificant ripples in the vast
ocean of hypocritical democracy.
Before some ignorant and
bigoted people start telling me and
the other Muslims to go and live in
Iran or some other eastern
country, I'd like to make it clear
that we are the third generation of
Muslims in this country, not to
mention the ever-increasing
numbers of English and other
Europeans who have converted to
Islam. Islam, its principles and
political policies are to be applied
to humanity regardless of the
colour, race or personal bias of
individuals who regard themselves
beyond the all-encompassing
nature of Islam. We know that we
can change the system (Piers
Daniell agrees) and that's what
we, Muslims, have been trying to
do through reducing public
ignorance about Islam. However,
for all the well-meaning advice
and enthusiasm of people like
Alan Bailey, London University
colleges have proved themselves
to be against the concept of
university being a bastion of free
thought, uninhibited expression, a
place where the world's future
leaders form their values....and
which principles they will embrace.
Some colleges have banned
Islamic Society altogether whilst
places like IC which let us exist on
paper and in a prayer-room,
refuse to let us exist in life.
This letter is not meant to be a
j Edited this week by Mark Baker
good moan about the wrongs
done to Islamic Socs and Muslims
in general but just to put the
record straight about students not
taking an active part in challenging
and questioning the system we live
under. As long as the two-faced
policy of freedom of speech and
expressions only applies to every
class of people of every inclination
and orientation, BUT MUSLIMS, I
fail to see any basis for being
outraged at the lack of life and
vitality in students. People who feel
this way i.e. outraged, depressed
and whatever at the apathy
amongst students should start
taking notice of Muslims' activity
other than with the intention of
curbing and repressing our voices
of protest.
Yours sincerely

It's a shame that you feel ICU has
taken away your freedom of
speech. I hope that this does not
continue in the future, as all people
deserve the right to voice their
opinion. In conclusion, I can only
agree with your letter.
