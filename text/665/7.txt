4. Stretching your grant even further.
Most students can obtain free
prescriptions and are entitled to
refunds on dental treatment and
glasses, provided the work is done
under the NHS. To be eligible for
these benefits you must have a
s u f f i c i e n t l y l o w i n c o m e .
Claimants on supplementary
benefit have an 'automatic right'
to this kind of free treatment, and
the DHSS usually considers the
student grant as roughly the
equivalent of supplementary
benefit when assessing the right
to help with medical costs.
However, if you receive a
scholarship or other forms of
extra income, you may not be
eligible for free treatment except
during the vacation
Prescriptions
You will require an exemption
certificate, granted to those with
a low income, if you wish to
obtain free prescriptions.' Apply
for an exemption certificate now
and don't wait until you need a
prescription.
Exemption certificates are well
worth having as they also give
you an 'automatic right' to the
other types of free medical
treatment described. This means
that you don't have to wait for
reimbursement of charges
already paid, but can literally
walk out without paying for
treatment!
Exemption certificates or re-
imbursement of prescription
charges for those who have
already paid can be obtained by
completing and returning form
P l l to the DHSS.
Dentists/Opticians
Unless you have an exemption
certifcate, you will usually have
to pay for your treatment at the
time and then reclaim the charge.
T o d o t h i s , ask y o u r
dentist/optician for a receipt and
the relevent forms (which s/he
may need to stamp), and send
them off to the DHSS.
Reimbursement for glasses is
limited to the cheapest type of
NHS frames and glasses, so if you
want to look suave and
sophisticated expect to pay the
extra.
Many extra entitlements are
available to students supporting
families, such as free milk and
vitamins for young children. You
should check that you are
receiving your full quota.

exemption certificates), D l l

This week Peter Burt examines the health and
dental benefits students are eligible for. This article
also explains how people who receive no grant
whatsoever can obtain financial assitance.
Services, DHSS offices, and large
post offices. It is important to
remember that you can only
receive free treatment if it is done
under the N H S , and you should
always check beforehand that
intended work can be covered by
the NHS.
Most students manage to earn
money by working at some stage
during their course. Vacation
work, especially if course-related,
will also provide you with useful
training. Income over the
vacation is not taxable below
£ 1,785 and will not affect the level
of your grant. However, earnings
during term time are supposed to
be declared to your L E A , and
income above £375 per year is
deducted pound-for-pound from
your grant.
Obviously 'proper' holiday
jobs are becoming scarcer, and
unless you find a course-related
job through your department or
sponsor, or know of someone of
influence, you will probably have
to look hard for one. Favourite
holiday jobs, such as Christmas
work for the Post Office, are
generally less available than in
past years, as employers tend to
recruit from those who have
spent a long time on the dole
rather than by choosing students.
Persistent hunting, though, will
probably find manual work such
as fruit-picking or building work
in the summer, if you don't mind
such employment.
Term time jobs usually exploit
the market for bar staff, shop
assistants, or baby sitters etc.
This area is quite fortunate in
having some fairly large
employers for such work.
Favourites among postgraduates
include d e m o n s t r a t i n g or
tutoring. If you have any special
skills you should try using them
to earn money, eg by busking,
drawing.
No Grant?
There are 350,000 students on
further education courses in this
country who get no grant
whatsoever. Most students on
first degree courses do receive a
mandatory award, but there are a
few unfortunate individuals who
are ineligible, frequently by
virtue of their attendance on a
previous course.
Regrettably, the outlook for
such people is very poor. The first
body to turn to for financial help
is your L E A , who may consider
you for a discretionary award.
Even at the best of times
discretionary awards were few
and far between, but you may be
lucky and it is worth contacting
your L E A , especially if they are
'big spenders'.
Otherwise you may possibly be
able to apply for Unemployment
or Supplementary Benefit. To be
eligible for these benefits you
must be available for work,
which is why full time students
cannot claim them during term
time. If, however, y o u r
department is prepared to state to
the relevant benefit office that
you are in part time attendance at
college (usually less than about
21 hours per week), you may be
entitled to receive such benefits.
It is well worth contacting your
department if you face such
hardship, as it is just conceivable
that they may have 'something up
their sleeve' to help you in other
ways.
If a claim for Unemployment
or Supplementary Benefit is
successful (which will depend on
a number of factors, ot least of
which is what kind of mood your
benefit officer is in!) you must
remember that, in the unlikely
event of a suitable job becoming
available, you will be expected to
give up your course to enter
employment.
Finally, it may pay to
approach an educational charity
for assistance. The 'Grants
Register 1983-5' (next edition is
published Autumn 1984) by
Craig Alan Lerner & Roland
Turner (Macmillan Publishers
Ltd; available in most good
libraries under Dewey classifica-
tion 378.3GRA) lists organisa-
tions p r o v i d i n g assitance/
s c h o l a r s h i p s / r e s e a r c h and
equipment grants etc. The book
is international in flavour and is
written for graduates and above.
You should also consult the
'Directory of Grant Making
Trusts', published by the
Charities A i d Foundation and
the 'Charities Digest' published
by the F a m i l y W e l f a r e
Association. Alternatively you
could try competing for a
scholarship. Details of many
such schemes are to be found in
teh booklet 'Sponsorship and
S u p p l e m e n t a r y A w a r d s '
available from the careers and
occupational information centre,
Moorfoot, Sheffield SI 4PQ.
The E d u c a t i o n G r a n t s
Advisory Service (EGAS7 can
also put further and higher
education students in touch with
sources of financial aid from
trusts and other bodies when
difficulties have arisen. They can
be contacted by writing to The
Student Adviser, Educational
Grants Advisory Service, The
Family Welfare Association,
501-505 K i n g s l a n d R o a d ,
Dalston, London E8 4 A U . Phone
01-254 6251.
In general, such charities
usually give preference to those ,
who have encountered unforseen
difficulties rather than those who
have knowingly commenced a
course without financial support.
They usually provide only
supplementary assistance, which
does not take the place of a full
grant, and tend to give priority to
those from disadvantaged
groups. Trusts are very unlikely
to help postgraduates or those
looking for second degrees or
additional qualifications.
In general, most of the benefits
and schemes I have described
apply only to Home students.
They are yours by right, and if
you don't claim them you must
have more money than sense! By
now you should already have
lokoed into the possibilities of
drawing up a" covenant and
applied for a rent rebate and
prescription and exemption
certificate. Remember that there
is usually a long wait before you
receive most benefits, which can
seldom be backdated, so the
sooner you apply the better.
As far as I know all the details
above are correct, and I have
made every effort to ensure that
they are accurate. They are only a
guide, however, and if you want
more help, please go and consult
Student Services (I must thank
Karen for her help in writing
this). Student Services know
more about these things than
most people, and should be able
to fill in any outstanding details.
