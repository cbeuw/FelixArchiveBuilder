NEWSP 1 OF I ERIAL COLLEGE U
NOW UC THEM. NOW YOU DONT!
Imperial College was raided by a mascotry team from University College
yesterday morning. The group of about 20 students disrupted a lecture in
the Chemical Engineering department and stole 22 honours shields from
outside the City and Guilds Union Office. The group consisted mainly of
students from U C L ' s Chemical Engineering department. Their first
target was a lecture theatre in Chemical Engineering building where they
showered Chem Eng 2 with flour, eggs and stink bombs for about half a
minute.
The remainder of the U C L
students .left the Chemical
Engineering building and rushed
along the walkway to Mechanical
Engineering. Here they pulled 22
shields from the wall. These
shields, each valued at £200, have
the names of Guilds Union
Officers on them. Professor
Husband, head of Mech Eng,
described the incident as 'quasi-
criminal'. One of the raiding
party was captured by IC
students and was later subjected
to a rag 'torture' in the Beit Quad.
The student captured, U C L
physicist Adrian Head, was taken

Security Officer. Although M r
Reeves wanted to call in the
police the heads of the
departments involved, Professors
Sargeant and Husband treated
the matter as a mascotry raid and
decided not to press charges. M r
Reeves decided to give Adrian
Head to the RCS mascotry team
to deal with as they saw fit. They
raised money for Rag by having
him covered in motor oil, wood
chips and a Mooney lasagne.
U C L Union denied knowledge
of the event saying that it was.
organised by the Engineering
Society. ' Mike Stuart, Guilds'
President, contacted them and
demanded the return of the
shields since they are not violate
mascots. Their response was to
set a ransom of £8 per shield, but
M r Stuart refused to consider
paying any ransom and threat-
ened to inform the police if they
were not returned by 5.30pm
yesterday. This deadline was
later extended to 2.00pm today,
and at the time of going to press
the shields had not been ret-
urned.

In his speech M r Bnttan
discussed the causes of increased
crime, pointing out that these
were of such a deep-rooted
nature that only long term
measures have any effect. As
Home Secretary, his more imme-
diate task was to reduce and
mitigate crime by incresing the
effectiveness of the police force
and the judicial and prison
systems. SDecifically, he high-
lighted the importance of the
relationship between the police
and the community. In discussing
police powers, and the necessity
for protecting the public against
the abuse of them, M r Brittan
ren rred to the Police and
Criminal Evidence Bill, currently
being passed through parliament.
Here, he said, the powers of the
police and the rights of the
individual had been very clearly
defined. The Bill also sets out a
system for dealing with com-
plaints against police, including
the provision of an independant

supervise investigations of com-
plaints.
I During the subsequent ques-
tioning, M r Brittan was asked to
! expand upon the causes of
j increased crime. In response, he
stressed that the critical factors
were social ones, such as the
decline of the family unit, and
that he did not believe there was a
direct correlation between high
unemployment and a high crime
rate.
When questioned about the
passing of excessively lenient
sentences in some recent rape
cases, he said that it would in
future be possible to refer such
cases to a court of appeal, which
could indicate what a more
appropriate sentence would have
been.
To nobody's surprise, the
question of hard-core porno-
graphy films was twice raised. M r
Brittan spoke initially of the
'more horrific material* which it
is iliegal to sell, and then
discussed the argument as to
whether certain types of film,
normally shown only in private
clubs, should also be available in
video shops. He indicated his
support for an amendment ban-
