Fridges on Southside landings
will have to be removed within
the next two weeks after an
inspection by G L C fire officers.
Since it is unlikey that all the
fridges can be suitably re-
positioned many of them may
have to be taken out of use.
During the summer Southside
was used as a hotel under the
Summer Lettings Scheme. This
encouraged the G L C to take a
closer look at the fire precautions
in the Southside Halls. The major
criticism was that the fridges,
which areelectricalappliancesand
contain large amounts of plastic,
are sited in the escape routes.
Originally it was hoped that
moving the fridges from the
landings to the lobbies would be
sufficient. However the G L C
have now told Bob F o g g o n
College Safety Officer, that he
must have the fridges moved in
two weeks.
Falmouth/Keogh warden, D r
Paul Jowitt has suggested several
possible solutions. In the short
term he thinks the easiest way to
deal with the problem is to put
the fridges in the cleaning
cupboards. However in the long
term he would like one room per
s t a i r c a s e t u r n e d i n t o a
kitchenette with fridges. The
other alternative he has suggested
is that each resident should be
supplied with a fridge. Dr Henry
H u t c h i n s o n , S e l k i r k / T i z a r d
warden, said these suggestions
were 'only scenarios'.
What is certain is that few if
any residents consider the fridges
a fire hazard. They would also be
extremely upset if there was a
reduction in the number of
fridges.

Last Thursday a thief entered two
unlocked Southside rooms and
stole the occupants' handbags.
The first incident occured at 7:45
when a man entered room 523
Tizard Hall while the resident
Vanessa Yates was asleep. When
she woke up the man apologised
for being in her room and left,
taking her handbag with him.
The thief then went to room 558
and took a handbag. Neither
resident was able to give a clear
description of the thief.

Nearly 100 people filled Read
Theatre to hear Conservative M P
John Carlisle and former I C U
and N U S President Tevor
Phillips, debate trade and
sporting links with South Africa
at an IC Debating Society event.
John Carlisle stated that the only
way to change apartheid was to
encourage links with South
Africa and that the 360 British
companies were benefiting the
black community who would be
the first to suffer from any
boycott.
Trevor Phillips countered M r
Carlisle's views by arguing that
changes in South Africa were
merely cosmetic and that
segregation broke the most basic
human rights, making it distinct
from other countries such as
Chile and the Soviet Union. M r
Phillips described some of the
arguments forwarded in favour
of links with South Africa as
'bollocks', feeling very strongly
about the issue. He concluded
that the only way to change
South Africa was by boycott and
even by s u p p o r t i n g a r m e d
struggle. Trevor Phillips won the
day by a 2:1 majority.
