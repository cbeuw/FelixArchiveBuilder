Dear Pallab
So Michael Newman has led
his crusade through the pearly
gates of Beit into the intellectual
much read, well balanced Daily
Express. As I flick through the
pages every day in checking my
Millionaire's Club number. I
cannot help judging the
political bias of the Express.
Therefore I'm sure the Express
would like to know what else
Saint Michael gets up to at
College. I'm sure they'd be
really sympathetic to his C N D
views for a start!
If Saturday's parable was
based on facts given to the
Express, then FELIX's ability
to distort facts pales into
insignificance alongside the
Express. C a n a national
journalist give the impression
that these 'sexy sessions'
happen fequently. or did our
knight in shining armour
simply forget to tell them it was
an annual occasion and not a
twice weekly gang bang?
The Express might like to
know the range of activist
groups funded by U G C grants
through student unions.
Perhaps Monseigner Newman
could continue his series next
week. At least no student union
money funded Hon Porn's
Night.
I can now hear howls of
protest from groups all over
C o l l e g e . ' F r e e d o m o f
expression!" and so on is their
war cry. This has been ICU's
viewpoint too. The Newman
block vote has been defeated
several times by a majority of
students using their (let's fact it)
democratic right to preserve
freedom of expression.
I have not attended Hon
Porn's Night, as is my right, and
have no intention of ever going.
It is not my right to force my
opinion on others who have
obviously made a democratic
decision to allow the freedom to
organise such an event.
The periodic whinings from
Mr Newman and his cronies
have led to open debate on his
'moral' issues in F E L I X and in
debates. I C U and students in
London will have little chance
to refute his allegations in the
national media. Thanks again
M r Newman. The student
image needs your actions like a
hole in the head. •

Postgraduate
Covenants
Dear Pallab
I would like to bring to the
attention of your postgraduate
readers a ^ i n t which Peter
Burt O' . r ' o o k e d in his
otherwisi excellent feature
'Stretching Y o u r Student
Grant' ( F E L I X 663).
In the SERC studentships
handbook sections 15.24 and
15.25 detail the position with
respect to covenants. In brief,
these state that no deduction
will be made from the award to
take account of the first £375pa
of income from any source and
that no deductions at all are
made in relation to gifts
(including money received from
parents) unless made under
covenant. Thus covenants
which would yield in excess of
£375pa merely serve to transfer
some of the financial burden of
your grant from the SERC back
onto your parents.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
1 am writing to express my
concern about my brother.
Having left IC 12 years ago, he
still uses the refectories as a life
member and is a self-confessed
Mooneyholic, unable I believe
to kick the habit.
Furthermore, I having left IC
2 years ago also continue to use
the refectories and am worried
about also have an addiciton.
Please adivse me if there is
any known cure.
Yours frettingly

Dear Pallab
Gosh, yes IC Union does it
again; organising a U G M to
which only 180 people turned
up. So the meeting was
inquorate wasting, time,
money, paper etc.
There can only be two
reasons for this: either the
meeting was i m p r o p e r l y
publicised or the content bored
people stupid.
Can I suggest a remedy.
Either have 25 semi-naked
nubile Philipino dancing girls
free fall onto Queens Lawn to
publicise U G M s ; or drop
motions which bear no
relevance to the affairs of IC
•like those on Grenada, and S
Africa, etc, and only call such
meetings when more pertinent
motions arise.

Dear Mr Ghosh
As the Hon Sec of the Selkirk
Hall disco appreciation society.
I should like to express our
annoyance to the fact that M r
'Cheapskate' Mooney has
stopped the weekly Stan's
disco. It would seem that the B—
has spent all the annual budget
on very slightly improving the
quality of the baked beans,
which less people consume than
attend the disco. We should
attend the disco.
Yours sincerely
Selkirk Hall Residents
Bums!
Dear Pallab
Michael Newman really
d e s e r v e s c r i t i c i s m f o r
contacting all the national
newspapers. Even people, like
me, who support M r Newman's
campaign must realise that he
has demolished one of his most
effective arguments.
It has been argued that by
banning Hon Porn Night, IC's
sexist image would be reduced.
This would hopefully increase
the number of women at
College. Now what ever the
Union does, in the eyes of Daily
Express IC students will always
be connected with porno-
graphy. If this prevents one
woman coming to College,
Michael Newman will be
responsible for increasing the
main origin of sexism at
College, the sex ratio.
The only argument advanced
by M r Newman to support his
cause is that students should be
proud of their Union. This may
be true but M r Newman has at
the same time demolished his
cause.
In my opinion there is little
Mr Newman can do to rescue his
cause. However perhaps ne
might like to apologise to
G a y n o r Lewis who was
pestered by journalists all
Friday. *
M r Newman has also shown
an alarming lack of respect for
the processes of U n i o n
democracy. A l l students have
the right, which M r Newman
has often exercised, to present
motions to a U G M . However
when they are not passed one
must accept that as democracy.
It is extremely childish to act as
Mr Newman has. He has started
using undemocratic methods
because democratic methods
have failed.
Yours sincerely

Dear Pallab
I'm told you're short of
letters. May I suggest the
E n g l i s h alphabet w h i c h
contains quite a few. If this is
not enough perhaps you may
care to investigate a 39 letter
alphabet pioneered by my
fellow country man George
Bernard Shaw.
Yours
