Thugs
Mascotry is one of the great traditions of L o n d o n University, particu-
larly in IC with the three C C U s . It provides lots of fun and
excitement and raises money for charity.
W h a t we witnessed yesterday c o u l d o n l y be d e s c r i b e d as
institutionalised vandalism. The University College thugs made no
attempt to find the Guilds mascot Spanner and Bolt but merely
wreaked havoc all over campus and stole 22 of the Guilds U n i o n
shields. These shields are not mascots, they are priceless to Guilds
and irreplaceable. If I were M i k e Stuart I'd certainly press charges
against those involved if the shields aren't brought back pronto.
Thefts
It seems that a group of people are entering Southside rooms which
have been left unlocked and stealing resident's cash, cheque books
and other small valuables. A s a H a l l resident myself I know what a
pain it is to lock your door every time you pop out of your room for a
couple of minutes. However unless you do you are asking for trouble.
There are no descriptions as yet of these walk-in thieves so if you see
anyone acting suspiciously in Southside inform security at once.
Fridges
The Southside Wardens are faced with a real problem as to what to do
about the landing fridges. The G L C regulations are in a way a
blessing in disguise since they will force College to convert some of
the Southside rooms in to snared kitchenettes, something that has
been long over due. The problem is what to do in the short term since
no work on reconversion can be started until the summer break. The
options open to the Wardens are to either put the fridges in the
cleaning cupboards (something that won't be popular with the
cleaners) or to have the fridges in a resident's room or, perhaps most
realistically, put all the fridges in a communal area on Gallery level.
Print Unit
The Union Print unit coexists with the F E L I X Office and is there to
print U n i o n societies' posters, booklets and other publicity. The print
unit is also available for students to have private jobs done: headed
notepaper, business cards, publicity for outside events, etc. Rates are
much lower than commerical printers and soon the print unit will be
introducing paper plates which are half the price of the metal ones we
use now. This will make small print runs even more economical than
before * m available most M o n d a y and Friday afternoons to assist
with ction of artwork.

Perola's Return
Those of you who read this column last year when it
I was written by Pinocchio will probably remember
I the fiendish puzzles set by Perola. Well, just when
you thought it was safe to go back to the puzzles
column, she has returned, and naturally enough, so
have General Reisenschein and Heidensieck
General Reisenschein has been getting very
worried about security recently, so, in his foolproof
disguise as a shop steward, he creeps into the
offices of his chiefs of staff and reads their reports.
H o w e v e r , he a l w a y s has p r o b l e m s with
; Heidensieck's reports, since the chief of the secret
I service uses a code.
Can you help our intrepid hero with this message?

Solutions, comments and criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday please. Â£5
from Mend-a-Bike for the randomly selected winner.
Last Week's Solution
The conversation shows that there are two other
tens, the ten of hearts, and a black ten, the ten of
spades say. When Ben says 'I knew you wouldn't,' it
shows that there are at least two diamonds (call one
the nine) and that for each diamond there is another
card of the same face value, but a different suit (so
the nine of spades will be there). When Bill says that
he knows its colour, it shows that there must be a
spade which doesn't have any other suit of the same
value, eg the eight. When Ben says that he knows
what the card is, it shows that the ten must be the
only card to appear in both red suits, since no
deduction could otherwise be made. So at least
three tens, two 'nines' and an 'eight' are there,
though the nines and eights are purely arbitary. So
the selection here is 10D, 9D, 10H, 10S, 9S, 8S.
Therefore, there is a minimum of six cards, of which
one is a heart.
Only six correct solutions, and the randomly
selected winner is Philip Milne of Physics 2, who can
collect his cheque from FELIX Office after 1:30pm
on Monday.
