I
C a r e e r s Pick-up
The job prospects for students
graduating from IC arc improv-
ing, according to College Careers
Advisor Dr Neil Hams. Onl\
6.49r of last year's graduates w ere
still unemployed at the end of
December and Dr Harris expects
this year's figure to be lower still.
It seems IC students have a head
start when it comes to getting
jobs since the unemployment
figure for graduates nationally is
twice that for IC.
The pick-up in recruitment is
most noticeable in the electronics
and computing industries, with
banking, accountancy and retail-
ing also showing improvements.
In electronics there are generally
more jobs available than there
are suitable applicants, the first
time such a situation has existed
in any industry for several years.
Retailing companies such as
Dixons, the consumer electronics
chain, and MacDonalds ham-
burgers are now starting to
recruit graduates where they
previously took A-Level qualifi-
cations.
Most engineering industries
have still to show signs of real
Neil Harris
improvement but the decline has
largely stopped. With little re-
cruitment for the past few years
companies are now finding it
necessary to recruit to avoid their
staff age distribution becoming
too top heavy. The oil industry is
still depressed along with chemi-
cal and mechanical industries,
but IC graduates have always
done well in comparison to other
university graduates in these
industries. The message from the
Careers Office is that for nearly
all IC graduates there will be a
job this year, but that you must
be prepared to be flexible in your
choice of career.
Invasion of
Toast Racks
New bicycle racks have appeared
around College in an effort to
reduce the problems caused by
lack of facilities for cyclists.
There will be 32 racks in total
when they all arrive, each holding
up to six bikes.
The new racks were designed
by the L o n d o n C y c l i n g
Campaign, who offered last year
to give two racks to College as a
result of a donation by Martin S
Taylor, last year's F E L I X Editor
and trick cyclist extraordinaire.
Subsequently College Domestic
Manager M r Iuan Thomas
ordered 30 more of the racks at a
cost of about £100 each.
Initially there has been some
reluctance on the part of IC's
cyclists to use the racks. This is
widely believed to be because few
people realised what they were
meant to be. However, gradually
more and more people have been
using the racks. M r Thomas is
anxious to point out that the
racks can be moved around and
he would welcome suggestions
from cyclists for suitable sites.
•After a hard day's work sweeping out his rat infesteddungeon
College Secretary John Smith likes to relax by playing FELIX
Bingo. This is because he knows that it has to be the biggest
bingo bonanza ever!
•Mr Smith is as keen as anyone to win the weekend in |
Amsterdam.
•Whether this is because he wants to see Rembrandt's
nightwatch in the Ryksmuseum or discover moreabout Gouda
cheese or just spend a pleasant weekend admiring the
attractive scenery (nudge nudge).
•What is certain though is that Mr Smithwillhave a good timeif |
he goes to the Hotel Cok.
•Beat him to the prize by checking off the numbers each week I
on your ULU card.
•When you have a full house come to the FELIX Office and I
claim your prize.
