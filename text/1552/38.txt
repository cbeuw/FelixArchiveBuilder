statement, let’s just say there’s a block
button for a reason.
Still here next year? Dare you attempt
to get a head start on your future
workload? Manage it and be hailed an
eager hero of our time. Or you could
just take a break and be hailed a hero
of taking breaks. Tough call.
If you’re relaxing at home for the
next few weeks there may come a
time where you’re bored – daytime
TV may have nothing left to give.
Judge Judy might be showing repeats
that you’ve already seen, or Doctors
might be taking its summer break.
When that time comes, it might be
worth at least having a glance over
some of the material you’ll be tack-
ling next year. It’d be more produc-
tive to channel your energy into that
instead of trying to work out Dr. Has-
key’s motives in the BBC’s premier
daytime soap.
Or you could take advantage of the
hot weather. Go on a trip to the sea-
side instead. Have an ice cream, get
stung by a jellyﬁsh, all that kind of
stuff. Who needs science when you’ve
got mildly painful life experiences?
nd so we come to the
end of another year of
fervent education. Sum-
mer’s around the cor-
ner; for those not con-
strained by academia, no doubt you’ll
be chilling by a pool in some exotic
location like Machu Picchu or Brent-
wood. And then there’ll be those of
you ready to dive into the world of
work for some reason, spending your
days and nights at internships or, if
you’ve graduated, “real jobs”. hat or
unemployment, because actually get-
ting a job is currently about as diﬃ-
cult as, well, getting a job.
But wait, there’s more! We still have
some pertinent advice to impart be-
fore you set off for the summer.
Yes, if you’re trapped in the web of
social media, there’ll be no avoiding
those eager to share their degree re-
sults with the world. Fair play, they
can put it down as a ‘life achieve-
ment’ on Facebook, e.g. “June 23
– Announced my degree results on
Facebook”.

As you glanced at me across silent study,
My heart leapt like that of a war buddy,
Under fire in a bunker of unrequited love.
My hand would fit yours like a glove.
I must gain your attention, not through talking,
But I would much prefer not to resort to stalking.
You were in need of a shave, as revision often dictates,
As I saw you pen a dissertation on cell states.
How I wish I could invite you for a jacket potato,
It would put an end to this lovelorn tornado!
As summer approaches, I know this is the end of times.
I dread you will never appreciate my weak rhymes.
