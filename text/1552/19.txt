We assemble our cheap ingredients – because we’re organized
*SQUAWK*erslikethat.Wegoteggsforprotein.Mushroomsbe-
cause they’re hip. Cheap-*SQUAWK* pak choi from North End
Road,becausenoteatingsomeofyour5adayisfor*SQUAWK*.
Bacon strips? Bacon strips are for mainstream *SQUAWK*ers.
Not wannabe bankers. Good bacon’s pricey – we’re skint. Basics
Bacon? More water than the Atlantic Ocean – *SQUAWK* no.
This week – we get broke from eating out all the time during exams. *SQUAWK* being domestic gods or goddesses, we’re tired. And
skint. We don’t got “YouTube money” to blow on real food like Harley and that lot – we need cash for the post-exam booze. So we buy
cheap like *SQUAWK* instant ramen and pimp it with *SQUAWK*ing leftovers to silence our *SQUAWK*ing stomachs.
We get our instant ramen. We like Shin Ramyun/Ramen because
it’s *SQUAWK* spicy and we’re tough like *SQUAWK* after all
thoseexams.Andit’s120g.DoublethesizeofBasics,stillcheaper
than two *SQUAWK*ing Basics packs. Available in Chinatown/
Bayswater. And it’s from Korea – Asians know their *SQUAWK*
ramenandflavors.Korea,Japan,China–they’reallgoodchoices.
You don’t *SQUAWK*ing mess with Asians. And their ramen.
We boil our ramen with seasoning and included extras like the
*SQUAWK*ing packet tells us to. Because we’re smart people
and can follow *SQUAWK*ing instructions. We’re just tired.
But we chop and prepare the rest of our ingredients while we
wait. Because we’re productive like *SQUAWK*. All that work
in exam season ain’t for nothing.
We add our mushrooms and eggs in midway through. Two
eggs, for two times the awesome. Not too early with the eggs
because we don’t eat tyre rubber. If we had leftover chopped
meat or SPAM, we’d put it in for more protein. You could. But
we *SQUAWK*ing don’t – we’re skint.
Pak choi leaves and pak choi leaves and pak choi leaves. We add
ourpakchoiinthelast30secondsbecausewestilllikeitcrunchy.
Limp and soggy pak choi is for *SQUAWK*. We then take it off
the *SQUAWK* heat. Because we’re *SQUAWK*ing hungry.
Weeatoutofthepotbecausewe’relazyas*SQUAWK*towash
a separate bowl. We use the pot lid as a plate for maximum
ghetto student factor. Just like the *SQUAWK*ing Koreans do.
We couldn’t find or afford a hot girl to eat our epic ramen like
in the EMT videos, so we settled with a *SQUAWK*ing Food
Editor. But it’s okay – we’re skint.
NEXT TIME:
We eat overdrafts.
A GlaDOS-approved list of ramen-
pimping additives:
- Leftover chopped meat (if chicken
breast, toss with a bit of cornﬂour to
keep meat moist.)
- Mixed frozen vegetables.
- Cabbage leaves.
- Lettuce leaves.
- Processed cheese (famous in Korea
and Japan for some bizarre reason.)
- Lime juice (think hai.)
- [Leftover] hard boiled eggs - if you’re
too chicken(!) to poach the eggs whole
like we do.
- Miso paste (because we like umami
and depth, not pure salt. Duh.)
- Extra spices (try star anise when
boiling broth, remove before eating.)
- Fish-shaped crackers.*
- Fish-shaped candies.*
- Fish-shaped solid waste.*
- Fish-shaped dirt.*
- Fish-shaped ethylbenzene.*
- Pull-and-peel licorice.*
- Candy-coated peanut butter pieces
(shaped like ﬁsh.)*
- Alpha resins.*
- Unsaturated polyester resin*
- A 20-ft thick impermeable clay layer*
(* We’re obviously pulling your leg.)
