Imperial’s cash
reserves rival
this chap’s
wrote an article last month
about how Imperial College is
run like a business. his busi-
ness doesn’t have the interests
of the students or its academ-
ics at heart. he week after my article,
a letter from Ian Howgate, hockey
player and former Imperial College
Union President, followed up on this.
Both of these articles caused a little
bit of a stir; I received an email from
Debra Humphris, Pro-Rector (Educa-
tion) and Neil Mosley, Head of Sport
Imperial, voicing their concerns and
asking to discuss things further. Fol-
lowing this, I set up a meeting with
Paul Beaumont (Union President), and
several other people who are involved
in College life from undergrads, post
docs and through to senior academ-
ics involved in designing courses. he
following spread hopes to expand on
where I think College and the Union
is going astray, what they are trying to
do about it, and if this is enough.
I don’t know all the solutions; if I did
I would have run for Union President
(there’s always next year folks!), but
hopefully this can be a starting point
– something to kick a conversation oﬀ
at least.
All of the numbers presented here
are easily obtainable by a (not that
quick) trawl through publicly accessi-
ble documents on the internet. All the
ﬁgures are there. I have edited the on-
line comments so they didn’t consume

an opportunity.
Imagine what we could do if College
aimed to only make 4% proﬁt next
year; we’d have an extra £30 million
to pump back into teaching, research
and that other key buzzword, the ‘Stu-
dent Experience.’
What is the ‘Student Experience’? I
can’t deﬁne it exactly and I’d challenge
anyone else to. However, with the in-
creasing commercialisation of higher
education in the UK, universities
across the board are trying to improve
it, trying to draw the best students to
their institutions. he people making
the decisions, the College Manage-
ment Board and the vast majority of
College Council generally have lim-
ited contact with students, which
hinders their approach to improving
it. Some large strides are being made
trying to make this right; the idea of
talking to us to ﬁnd out what we want
and need is starting to take hold, but it
is far from across the board.
Our one link is the Sabbs; the Union
President sits on the highest board in
College, the College Council. his is
quite a rare privilege, and one that has
been revoked previously, but we do
have a voice here. A voice that could
be used by everyone; those who want
a moan or to make things better. But
how can the average student get his
view across? Supposedly the Union
Council; anybody can go to one of
their meetings and have their say. You

should care
Very little. Very few people had any idea
what College Council is, what they did or
who they were. “Rubber Stamp College
policy” was probably the most insightful
comment.
They have the final say on everything.
They decided on Acton and Life Sciences
cuts; every major decision goes through
them. The Union President is the stu-
dents’ lone voice here.

than they are, what are we doing with
this extra cash? It’s certainly not going
to the Union, which received a lowly
£1.4 million last year, nor is it used to
give extra time to ailing Departments
while they sort their ﬁnancials out.
(See Life Sciences who reportedly had
a deﬁcit of 1.5 million.) So where is
this money going?
Maybe we’re short of money and
don’t hold enough reserves? If we
paid oﬀ all of our outstanding debt to-
morrow, College would still be sitting
on a cool £96 million.
Flexibility is an issue with all large
corporations. Imperial is no diﬀer-
ent; red tape regularly obstructs novel
projects or ideas. Imagine if £50,000
was set aside to pay for ﬂights for 50
students to do an IROP in the US,
and another £50,000 to let 200 keen
students go to conferences; to show
them oﬀ to the rest of the world and
to actually further their learning. So
far we’ve spent £100k, 0.16% of the
surplus last year, made a huge diﬀer-
ence to 250 people (3% of undergrads)
and shown our best and brightest oﬀ
to academics around the world. But
there are massively limited resources
currently available for opportunities

the whole two pages, and have drawn
several conclusions from a non double
blind straw poll of about 30 students
in the Union on a hursday night.
here are big changes on the hori-
zon in higher education. Degrees have
evolved from being direct precursors
to employment to being a tool to go
into an unrelated, high paying job
where the academic skills you spent
four years of your life slaving away
on mean nothing. I’m looking at you,
Mr Management Consultant. To try
and keep up with what students need
from their time at university, College
is going to have to start listening to
us more seriously and more often; no
longer can they aﬀord to use consult-
ing students as a box ticking exercise.
We as students, adults and mem-
bers of this university do actually have
a voice. Most people don’t realise this,
but at the highest levels there are peo-
ple who are willing to listen and peo-
ple that do care. he problem comes
in bridging the gap between what the
average student wants and needs and
what these people hear. Communica-
tion, that overused buzzword, is again
the key.
We, the student body, were not con-
sulted on Acton. I’m not suggesting, as
one academic did, that commercially
sensitive information be leaked, just
that the consultation with the student
body (and the oft overlooked academ-
ic body) should have occurred well
before money reared its ugly head.
#AgainstActon was too little too late
and there was nothing we could do to
stop it. he campaign did, however,
manage to get a response out of the
College Management Board. No idea
who they are? No I didn’t have any ei-
ther; they are the people that make the
day to day decisions and ultimately
run Imperial. Why does nobody know
who this extremely powerful group of
people are?
his response was more than all
those vociferous campaigns against
the Life Sciences cuts got. An actual
response from senior management
seems to have acknowledged that this
was a mistake. Although they will
never admit this in those words, they
are at least trying to put it as right as
they can at this late stage by conduct-
ing a review. I love reviews. A detailed
review of Evelyn Gardens and Garden
Hall to actually see what condition
they are in? Perfect. But why were
decisions made before this detailed
information was known?
he Union website also states that
negotiations over Evelyn Gardens’
lease are also ‘too commercially sensi-
tive’ to be widely consulted on – surely
this is the perfect time to listen to our
representatives, and avoid a repeat of
the Acton ﬁasco.
Commercial priorities seem to
take precedence over many aspects
of College life. hey are obviously an
important part of any business; es-
pecially one as large as Imperial. he
College had an income of £765 million
last year, with a surplus (read: proﬁt)
of £63 million; a surplus to turno-
ver ratio of 8.3% (the percentage of
the money made that is proﬁt). his
number is high compared to other
institutions – though not as high as
the year before when it was 13%. A
brief search of other similar organisa-
tions yielded some interesting results
(shown in the bar chart over the page);
the going rate seems to be about 2-4%
with no-one else coming close to our
margin. So if we’re outperforming our
competitors by making more money
won’t get a vote, and you won’t know
what they are discussing until you go
along. he ﬁles are online and availa-
ble but this is not the same as advertis-
ing the agendas. Only one paper this
year was submitted by a non Council
member while 93% were submitted by
the Sabbs. Is this representation?
So what happens during a meeting?
he Union Council vote on papers
covering a wide range of topics in-
cluding recommendations to College.
hese papers then allow the Sabbs to
take the “Oﬃcial View” of the students
to their other meetings throughout
College and lobby the people with real
power to make changes. College can
and do ignore our recommendations;
particularly on some of the more
contentious issues, as is their right.
Generally however they do listen and
want to make changes as they want us
to be happy. It’s in their best interests
both ﬁnancially and academically. he
“You Said We Did” campaign ran by
the Union this year is trying to high-
light the steps that we are making and
trying to make Union Council seem
more than just a lobbying group.
It is slightly more than this. We do
have the power to make changes to
things that directly aﬀect the Union.
Consider this example: I present a pa-
per to Council resolving to never have
another Summer Ball. If this passed
then the Union would never have
another Summer Ball. (It would have
to pass the Imperial College Union
Trustee Board ﬁrst but assume they
rubber stamp it.) To reiterate: anyone
can present a paper and everyone on
Council gets a vote. his suddenly
gives more weight to every position
that comes with a seat on the Council.

Your comments
45% of students don’t

for students
Or does it? Are we all that apathetic?
I can’t believe this. We do care; high-
est election turnouts in the country
do not scream apathy. I think we just
need to feel that we can actually make
a diﬀerence. I think that it is that peo-
ple feel powerless against ‘he Union’
or ‘he College.’ We don’t get a lot of
power but we could use what we have
a lot more eﬀectively.
Without trying to sound too hacky
or desperate, I implore you to get in-
volved. Stop moaning and make some
changes. If only by writing a moany
article in Felix, make the administra-
tors sit up and listen. hey control
your time at College but they need us
to be on side. Call their bluﬀ occasion-
ally, make them think – this is the only
way to improve the ‘Student Experi-
ence’ here – they’ve shown they can’t
do it by themselves.
