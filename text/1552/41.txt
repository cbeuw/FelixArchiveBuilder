This week you decide it’s time
you learnt to deep-throat, as
you reckon the ability to give
fantastic blow-jobs could
make up for all your facial
and personality flaws. You
find a willing recipient and
suck enthusiastically. Your
gag reflex takes over and you
vomit all over his penis. Prac-
tice makes perfect…
This week you develop a cut-
lery fetish. You visit your grand-
parents so you can get randy
with their best silverware, but
become jealous when you see
your granny licking jelly off a
dessert spoon. So you turn
to your trusty spork. It may be
flimsy, but at least you have
a choice between probing
prongs and smooth scraping.
This week you perfect the art of
lucid dreaming. Now you can
have an intense foursome with
Ryan Gosling, your personal tu-
torANDtheRector,andstillgeta
good night’s sleep. Plus, there’s
no morning-after awkwardness,
spaffy sheets or chafing! One
problem: when you nap in lec-
tures everyone hears you sleep-
moaning about ‘Keith’.
This week you visit your
childhood rabbit’s grave.
You tenderly dig him up and
gently slide your thumb into
his anus; it’s cold and mag-
goty but still strangely com-
forting. You reminisce about
the good times you had with
bunny in the raspberry patch
when you could fit 3 fingers
in… He taught you so much.
This week you are curious to
know what your clitoris tastes
like. You can’t reach it as it
is, so hack a bit off and fry it
up with some lady juices. It’s
curiously salty and you wish
you’d showered off the sweat
beforehand. Nevertheless,
it’s not unpalatable and there
are plenty more folds left to
try…
This week it’s the end of
term. Why don’t you get em-
barrassingly drunk, take as
many drugs as you can get
your hands on and sleep with
all your friends? Everyone will
have forgotten how badly you
gurn by week 3 of their mind-
numbing internship and a
few more notches to your
bedpost. Nothing to lose!
This week you are celebrat-
ing the end of exams at the
Union when you see the girl
you are in love with. You
down a few more pints to
give you the courage to ask
her out, but forget what a
lightweight you are and pass
out at her feet. She ignores
you, but that’s better than re-
jection, right?
This week you are desperate
for drugs but are not ‘street’
enough know any dealers.
So you buy a tracksuit and
‘swagger’ over to your nearest
estate. You approach the first
person you see and politely
ask if ‘they’ve seen Mandy any-
where?’ Turns out their daugh-
ter is called Mandy and they
think you’re a paedo. Nice one.
This week you’re so hungover
you can’t get out of bed, so
you puke over your teddy bear
and cuddle their sticky fur in re-
morse. It turns out you’re semi-
blind from alcohol poisoning
and you just vomited all over
thehairygirlyoubroughthome.
She wakes up and voms over
you too, and you spoon in your
mingled stomach contents.
This week you become allergic
to your own penis, and it be-
comes red and itchy as the au-
toimmune disease develops.
On the plus side, the inflam-
mation has added considera-
ble girth. Soon starts to slough
off and eventually all you are
left with is a few pubey scraps
of dangling dead skin flapping
redundantly by your balls.
This week you hide in a cup-
board in your course exam-
iner’s office, waiting for an op-
portune moment to correct the
exam you fucked up, but you’re
desperate for the loo. Well, they
already smell of piss and you
can’tfaceretakes,soyoubrace
yourself for the warm trickle
down your trouserleg and onto
their favourite lab coat.
Thisweekyoumustchoosebe-
tween sucking off a blue whale
and having barnacles for skin.
The whale penis would dislo-
cate your jaw and the whiplash
from the force of its ejaculate
would break your neck. But the
barnacle skin would leave you
rigid, immobilised, and forever
ostracised from society. What’s
it going to be?
