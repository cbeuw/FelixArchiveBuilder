SPONSOR
NED
Ned has just ﬁnished Ironman Wales
2.4 mile swim, 112 mile cycle, then a
marathon. ALL IN ONE DAY
He did it to raise money for the Cystic
Fibrosis Trust, so please dig deep
and spare a few of your pennies. The
person who gives the most will be
allowed to touch his tan lines.
You can sponsor him by visiting www.
justgiving.com/NedsIronman OR by tex-
ting 'IRON66 £x' where x is the amount
you'd like to give to 70070. Both ways
of donating go straight to the charity.
If you send the text, the amount will be
taken out of your phone bill.
The rugby boys all love a
good tackle.
All they want is for you
to be part of their scrum.
