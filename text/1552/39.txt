W
ell know
for not be-
ing very se-
rious when
d e a l i n g
with Union matters, Paul died
of exhaustion on a treadmill in
Ethos when someone pointed
out it stated in the Constitu-
tion that he had to run for 5000
hours on the highest setting
before being allowed to ﬁnish
his Presidency. Others would
shy away from such a chal-
lenge. However, deciding the
Constitution was the most im-
portant document to ever exist
in human history (“FUCK THE
MAGNA CARTA” was his bat-
tle cry), Paul took the challenge
on.
Paul did manage an impres-
sive 24 seconds until the hun-
ger pains started setting in. By
the end of it, his body was only
identiﬁed by the note in his
pocket saying “is aﬀordable and
close housing that much to ask
people. Really.”
He was known for campaign-
ing against halls being built in
Acton and also bringing the stu-
dents an open bar Summer Ball.
Although the bar was only open
to staﬀ who would be behind
the bar selling drinks to people.
His ﬁnal request was to be
buried near to the university
that he cared about so deeply.
Top dons at College therefore
have laid him to rest in Man-
chester, for a small but explain-
able fee of £10 million. hey
didn’t tell anyone until after it
was done.
A
lways known for
his incredibly
working class ac-
cent and scruﬀy
appearance, Shiv
Vorha was a big character in
the Medic world at Imperial.
Shiv met his sticky end in a
literal and metaphorical way.
He just couldn’t handle be-
ing away from medicine for a
year, so he started to practice
surgery on himself. He decid-
ed that the best place to start
would be the scrotum. So he
used a chainsaw to attempt
to delicately shave himself to
prepare for the operation. Un-
fortunately, at the time he was
in Reynolds and the disgusted
crowd’s chants put him oﬀ. He
slipped and the rest, as they
say, is a costly medical bill in
a private hospital as the A&E
units in all of the local hospi-
tals were being closed to save
money. At Reynolds someone
shouted asking if a doctor was
in the house. Everyone looked
sheepishly at the ﬂoor saying
“we don’t do that sort of thing
until 5th year, sorry”.
Staﬀ at Reynolds had to use
industrial strength bleach to
remove the semen and blood
that spewed out. hey have
been paid treble overtime for
the trauma that they have re-
ceived. His last words were, re-
portedly: “On second thoughts,
I should have just gone with
the scalpel”. He was buried in
a t-shirt, stockings and with a
stethoscope around his neck,
as per his request.
N
ow he is mainly
remembered for
conquering the
stage lighting,
which he viewed
as his main task for the year. As
a DramSoc techie there was
only one way that Henry was
ever going to depart this Earth:
autoerotic asphyxiation. Or,
to give it its scientiﬁc name:
chokewankmishap.
he alarm was raised when
he was not seen ﬁddling with
some kind of light for two
weeks. By this stage his corpse
had several mice living in it.
he student that found him
died from shock and arousal.
Henry is survived by thou-
sands of hours worth of paper-
work to do and an inbox full
of unreplied emails asking for
help with everything from get-
ting dressed to buying a small
island in Greece, which, due to
the economic crisis, is actually
something that 99% of clubs
can aﬀord nowadays.
DramSoc have decided to
script and rehearse a tribute
play to him. hey have enlist-
ed the help of Keanu Reeves
to play the title character of
Henry. he play will be based
on scripts found in Henry’s
draw. hey are all set in a ‘uto-
pian vision of the future’, where
the Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) gets to order death
by ﬁring squad to those that
ﬂaunt the rules in place. Keanu
Reeves said that he was “really
out of work and can’t believe
it’s really come down to this”.
K
angaroos and
other animals
giddily bounced
on Stefan’s limp,
lifeless corpse
making it only recognisable by
the expression on his face.
Long know for his high-spir-
its and cheery outlook on life,
Stefan occasionally rubbed
people up the wrong way by
being too smiley all the time.
He risked getting smile lines,
which, at his ripe old age of 92
would have been permanent.
he tale of how he came to
end up in Australia is a strange
and baﬄing one. After tasting
the Union food, he decided he
needed to ﬂee the country so
he wouldn’t be associated with
it. He nearly changed his mind.
He tried having a vodka coke
to calm him down. Unfortu-
nately he had to wait 5 minutes
for the tap to pour some mixer
into the plastic cup. By then he
was just to annoyed to change
his decision to ﬂee the coun-
try. Using a stolen passport he
made his way to the airport.
he alarm was raised soon
after when someone wanted
to buy something and so sent
a ‘polite’ email to him as a
reminder that there is some-
thing to approve. On the run
from the law he tried to hide
amongst the wild life down
under. His costume hadn’t ar-
rived as he was waiting for
himself to approve the ex-
penditure. He was spotted as a
fraud and stampeded. His last
words were “Bah Humbug”
E
ventually the dildo
penetrated deep
enough to cause
damage to the in-
ternal organs. hat’s
what the oﬃcial report says.
here are doubters who believe
it could be a conspiracy theory.
Perhaps killed by a Depart-
mental Representative who no
longer gave a fuck about how
many people did SOLE.
Doug was found in the bath-
room of the Library by a stu-
dent who did not wish to be
named. His face was apparently
twisted into “a mixture of relief
and terror”. he student is now
being treated for post trau-
matic stress syndrome, and has
been given extra time to resit
her exams. Ironically, there is
now ﬁnally an example of a stu-
dent that has found a Deputy
President (Education) to be ac-
tually useful in their role.
A Hangman reporter showed
pictures of his corpse to friends
to get a reaction. After they
stopped laughing, they said
that they were upset to hear of
his demise.
It took over ﬁve weeks for
Doug’s rotting corpse to be
found. Most people saw his
Facebook status updates had
become spare and were glad
about it, deciding to not raise
the alarm.
Doug was a lover of many
things, mainly dildos. Although
his demeanor means he will
not be missed by many people.
Actually, that sentence didn’t
need the fourth “m” in it.
R
arely did Becky
Lane ever touch
alcohol. She was
noted for her t-to-
tal attitude. In fact,
she used to faint at the sight of
vodka. However this wasn’t the
way that she met her end.
Becky brieﬂy ran for Union
President, meaning she would
be a sabbatical for two years
straight. his was classed as a
sure-ﬁre sign of a serious men-
tal health problem, and was, in
all likelihood, a cry for help.
She was known for want-
ing to reduce stress in stu-
dents’ lives. What most people
don’t know is that there was a
lengthy legal battle after the
massages given to students in
the Library turned out to in-
clude happy endings. It was
a shame that it rained when
there was a bouncy castle on
Queen’s Lawn, and an even big-
ger shame that she slipped and
died. Unfortunately for her eve-
ryone was bouncing so much
that nobody noticed. hey
eventually bounced so much
that she fell into a crevice.
Fast forward three months
and nobody has realised. Ex-
cept for the company that hires
out bouncy castles. hey were
terriﬁed and scared they would
lose their livelihoods. So they
hatched a brilliant plan. hey
hired a replacement to stand in
for her, like that stupid Eliza-
beth I rumour. he trickery was
discovered last weekend when
everyone realised Becky wasn’t
originally a 6 foot 2 black guy.
