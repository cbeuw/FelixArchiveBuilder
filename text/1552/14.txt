FRIDAY 21 JUNE
Rupert Neate
Rupert Neate was Editor in 2005-06. I
met him on a Friday at the Guardian
headquarters. He currently writes for
the economics section of the Guard-
ian.
TA: How did you get involved in Fe-
lix and why?
RN: Started writing some news sto-
ries in my third year. hat was really
fun. I liked it so I wanted to stand for
election, which I did and became the
Editor for next year.
Campaigning was great. Our cam-
paign was very gimmicky. I dressed
up as Rupert the Bear and had loads
of Rupert the Bear stickers. Had slo-
gans like ‚ÄúVote Neate It‚Äôll be Sweet‚Äù
that my friend Iain Heaton came up
with, and wrote that in chalk every-
where around College. College secu-
rity told us oÔ¨Ä for doing that but we
continued doing it anyway. hen I got
banned from the election for defacing
College property. (pauses)
TA: Wait? What happened then?
RN: I then appealed.
TA: And won, presumably?
RN: Yeah. After we were told oÔ¨Ä I
only wrote on the pavements and not
in College. hey were quite serious,
because they didn‚Äôt really want me to
win. hen they didn‚Äôt really like me
when I was in oÔ¨Éce.
It‚Äôs good not to be liked. You know
how they give Honourary Life Mem-
bership? hey voted not to give me
one. (laughs). Which was after I won
the awards [Guardian Student Media
Award].
TA: Did you think as Editor it‚Äôs bet-
ter to be liked or not liked?
RN: Not liked. Generally. Especially
not liked by College. If you‚Äôre liked
by College you‚Äôre doing something
wrong.
TA: What are the memorable sto-
ries you did?
RN: We were very campaigning. Col-
lege were trying to introduce a dress
code. hey were going to ban the hi-
jab, the muslim headscarf. So we ran
a campaign against that and got a lot
of coverage on it. Like on ITV News
and that sort of thing. So they had to
back track on that. I was quite pleased
with that.
Did a lot of things about Ethos. hat
was all going to be really unfair. It
wasn‚Äôt going to be free and the pre-
vious ones were free. We did a thing
about College in Charing Cross Hos-
pital ‚Äì you know how they have the
yellow bags of clinical waste? he
were just leaving it in corridors ‚Äì so
did a thing about that. Did a thing ex-
posing how many robberies there are
from halls.
A thing about security on College.
Because on the back of that dress
code thing they were saying they need
security. So I asked them why they
needed that. You know they‚Äôve got a
little nuclear reactor. We did a piece
on that. hat was fun. It was very fun.
I liked causing trouble.
TA: What
were the
high points
of your year?
RN: he
highs were
when we have
the amazing
stories and
campaigning
stories. We
did a story
about the As-
toria banning
some club
or society. It
was basically banning them because
they were all black and they‚Äôve got a
ban on black music. So we got them
to u-turn on that as well. hat was
fun. We re-introduced Page 3 [now
the centrefold]. Someone had done
it like 3 years before us. I liked doing
that. Appeared in it twice. Have you
done it?
TA: I‚Äôve done it twice, yeah. So what
were the lows?
RN: he lows were when we had no
one to write for us. And I didn‚Äôt ever
sleep on Wednesday. Every week be-
cause no-one had written anything,
no one would Ô¨Åle on deadline. So you
end up staying up all night, writing
the front page. hat‚Äôs always the bit
you leave till last when you‚Äôre knack-
ered, so that is stupid. hen all layout.
hat was low.
TA: hat‚Äôs interesting. Because I
always leave the front page till last.
And my own editorial.
RN: Yeah I know - I did the editorial
even behind that. Get everyone else‚Äôs
shit out of the way. hat‚Äôs a good edi-
tor though.
TA: Yeah. I think so‚Ä¶ I like to think
it‚Äôs selÔ¨Çess, but I like to tell every-
one as much as possible..
RN: Good that you‚Äôre still having an
editorial. here wasn‚Äôt an editorial
when I started one. I think there deÔ¨Å-
nitely should be one.
TA: You‚Äôre working at the Guardian
now. What are the big diÔ¨Äerences
between being at Felix and a real
newspaper?
RN: Lots of diÔ¨Äerences. Well. You‚Äôre
not in charge. I liked being in charge.
I liked being able to tell people what
to do. Although you can‚Äôt do that
much because otherwise they won‚Äôt
write for you. I had a few of those in-
stances. I liked being able to just have
ideas and then just do them. I liked
the stress because it was
fun. It was the most fun
I ever had. Working in a
proper newspaper is dif-
ferent, because you can‚Äôt
be all over the most im-
portant story all the time.
You can occasionally, and
that‚Äôs great, but you can‚Äôt
do everything. You have
to do your bit. Obviously
it‚Äôs a lot more profession-
al. And then it‚Äôs good to
be around so many other
people who are amazing.
TA: Did you ever have
any slow news weeks?
RN: Yeah we did have some that
weren‚Äôt that great. I was looking
through last night. here was only one
or two that I‚Äôm not proud of. I tried to
keep some stories back. If we had a big
week I‚Äôd keep a story back in case the
next week we didn‚Äôt have one.
TA: Shit‚Ä¶ hat‚Äôs a really good idea.
RN: Yeah, some weeks you‚Äôve got
loads of good stories and that could
splash the paper so you save that one.
You‚Äôve got to make your news I
think. hat would be my advice. All
of our big stories we made ourselves.
Find some shit out. I always wanted to
Ô¨Ånd the monkeys. here were always
rumours that College were using them
for clinical research. We never did
that. You should deÔ¨Ånitely do that!
TA: Did you have many complaints
about the paper?
RN: We had complaints about Page 3.
Like a lot. We did a poll and then basi-
cally everyone wanted Page 3. So we
said we apologise if we oÔ¨Äended any-
one. We had a warning thing on the
page before saying nudity was on the
next page.
You talked to Pallab Ghosh. What
did he say, did he like doing it? Did he
still remember?
TA: He told me he tried to annoy
people. And a Ô¨Ågure in College he
didn‚Äôt like he did a running cartoon.
He seemed that he would always try
to Ô¨Ånd something scandalous.
RN: hat‚Äôs good. I like that attitude.
We did that with the sport guy. Af-
ter we did lots of negative stories
about Ethos I went in there to reÔ¨Åll
the bin. here were no papers in it
and the bin wasn‚Äôt there. Basically, he
had taken the bin for Felix and put it
in the cupboard as he didn‚Äôt want it.
So we did a whole story about press
censorship and freedom and all this.
And we got all of these people the bu-
reau on censorship to give us quotes
about this. About how he shouldn‚Äôt
have taken away the issue because he
didn‚Äôt like it. So that was brilliant. We
did a whole story about them trying to
censor Felix, which they hated. And
then did a cartoon of him as a dragon
eating Felix. Apparently he got some
money from College for damages or
something. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true,
but that‚Äôs what I heard. He never com-
plained at the time.
TA: Of all the aspects of Felix, which
did you enjoy the most?
RN: Writing the stories.
TA: he least?
RN: Laying it out and spell checking it.
I didn‚Äôt really bother for lots of pages.
You can‚Äôt fucking read all those pages.
I used to send a copy to my dad each
week. He rang me up one time and
was like ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got lots of ‚Äòcunts‚Äô in
the sports pages‚Äù. Someone had writ-
ten a review with basically ‚Äòcunt‚Äô all
the way throughout. I was like ‚Äúdo we?
I didn‚Äôt realise that‚Äù. I did not read it.
TA: I read everything before it gets
sent oÔ¨Ä! I still do get that from my
parents though. Each week my mum
Ex-Editor interviews
texts me to point out a spelling er-
ror‚Ä¶
RN: Felix was brilliant. he only thing
in my career afterwards that has bet-
tered it since was the Liam Fox story
that made him resign that I did. hat
was when it was like being at Felix
again. I was working ridiculously hard.
Every day until like midnight every
night, so I could be above all the com-
petition. hey were all my sources, so
I had control and could do whatever I
wanted and getting loads of stuÔ¨Ä out
and it was very trouble making and
very much like Felix but on a massive
scale.
TA: So I guess I‚Äôve got the general
aim of your year was tear shit up!
RN: It should be. Imperial is a diÔ¨Äerent
university to others. It‚Äôs not fun. Peo-
ple are very willing to just do whatever
College says. he Union weren‚Äôt will-
ing to stand up to College as they were
too busy getting friendly with College.
And I think it‚Äôs important that you
have people there who can hold Col-
lege to account, because no one else is.
Especially the Union.
TA: How about the internet?
RN: Internet was changing back then.
One of our editions was when we Ô¨Å-
nally were allowed Facebook. It was
originally American universities. hen
American universities, Oxbridge and
LSE. We did a big double page spread
on it. Loads of people at LSE had Fa-
cebook and it was a known thing, we
were jealous. here was a massive
thing about Facebook. Like how to
take your proÔ¨Åle picture. All this stuÔ¨Ä.
hat‚Äôs how long ago that was. Not that
long ago‚Ä¶
