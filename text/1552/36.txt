FRIDAY 21 JUNE
40
Felix-ception. BWWWAAAAM!
Good old E3. Every year, hundreds of
game developers and publishers, out-
line what it is that’s going on in the
world on gaming at the moment, and
what’s upcoming in the year ahead. Be
it the latest technology or the games
themselves, us gamers are treated to
a literal feast of information, being
packed into exciting press conferenc-
es, high-action trailers and impressive
demonstrations.
his is great, but I feel there is a
problem. As hyped up as E3 is, or
rather tries to be, I feel that it’s lost
some of its original excitement lately.
he event feels too similar each year;
we’re greeted with a lot of sequels,
nearly all from the same developer or
publisher powerhouses, and overall I
get the impression that not much is
changing. And while I’ve always pre-
ferred to play games on my PC, the
new consoles from Sony and Micro-
soft don’t appeal hugely either.
So what is so disappointing about
the show this year? Let’s start with
the obvious ‘anti-star’; Microsoft’s
new console, the Xbox One. Al-
though revealed almost a month in
advance of E3, it has already met with
harsh criticism. he requirement of
an “internet veriﬁcation” every 24
hours for oﬄine play, restrictions on
the resale of used games, and the re-
quirement for the use of Kinect to be
permanently attached to the console
have already caused a lot of contro-
versy. his apparent slow erasure of
consumer rights has provoked a lot
discord from gamers. Whilst anti-pi-
racy measures are understandable, it
seems a shame that many companies
still opt for draconian DRM meas-
ures.
Sony’s latest device, the PlaySta-
tion 4, doesn’t feature any of these
requirements thankfully, receiv-
ing many cheers at their conference
when this was announced. Indeed
the “Oﬃcial PlayStation Used Game
Instructional Video” is an excellent
piece of marketing. Not only this, but
Sony have shown a lot more support
for independent developers, allowing
self-publishing on their new console.
However, I ﬁnd it still fails to appeal.
hat multiplayer play on the PS4 can
now only be accessed as part of the
paid “Playstation Plus” subscription
service seems to be an odd choice,
especially as it was a key selling point
for Sony’s previous console. Also like
the new Xbox, there doesn’t seem to
be much variation in the games an-
nounced for the new consoles.
As one would expect, there are a
lot of sequels announced at E3 for the
already well-established franchises.
Call of Duty, Mario Kart, and FIFA
are three particular examples which
come to mind. No doubt these games
sell well enough, however for a con-
ference which aims to show the latest
in gaming, it seems somewhat ironic
that we are greeted with such a simi-
lar selection of titles each year. I can
probably guess that next year’s con-
ference will involve many more of the
same names. I’m not against sequels at
all, but a lot of the focus could be said
to be around so called “shovel-ware”.
hese are releases which are perceived
to be more-or-less the same game in
a long line of sequels from consecu-
tive years. Is this really anything to be
excited about? Some more variation
would be nice; there have been other
interesting concepts for games which
have appeared in the past few years. It
would be good to see something other
than the standard array of sports ti-
tles, modern/futuristic military shoot-
ers and fantasy RPGs.
Perhaps this is nonsense though. I
suspect my view of previous years is
clouded by some nostalgia of teenage
excitement for what was then the next
big thing. hat and my prolonged wait-
ing for Valve’s ‘Ricochet 2’ means that
surely anything I say should be taken
with a pinch of salt? Maybe so, but I for
one was not particularly enthused by
much at E3 this year. hat’s not to say
I’m not looking forward to anything.
here are of course of lot of interesting
new games out there –Watch Dogs and
Mirror’s Edge 2 to name a couple. he
overall spirit of the conference seems
to be missing, however.

E3 – I am disappoint
As new Editor for Food section, I want
to share with you favourite sandvich.
Sandvich ideal for pushing kart
or having break b e t w e e n
crushing puny spines. Cake best for
celebration.
his sandvich recipe was handed
down through family, and very good.
You need: bread, meat, salad, cheese,
plus olive and toothpick. To make,
put ingredients on plate, and eat. If
your friend is sad, you can drop
sandvich on ﬂoor, and friend feel
happier.
Cake is masterpiece. Made
from tears of enemy, mixed
with their fear. Tastes like vic-
tory. Many little men try to
take cake, but unable to eat, because
of broken bones. I break, because
cake for winners. Unlike sandvich,
cake recipe is national secret. No-
one to be told recipe. If anyone ask,
cake is lie.

he weather outside was lovely yes-
terday. I saw a deer. I drew a painting
for you, I hope you like it more than
your parents ever liked you. hat isn’t
hard though. Even looking at it the
painting counts as a win in my book.

It’s a tenuous link to news, but as you
might have noticed, from the hearse-
delivered copies of Felix this week, this
is the last issue of the year.
Wow, I can hear your crying from
here – tone it down a bit.
All joking aside, it’s been a great
year for gaming, with the next gener-
ation of consoles revealed (for better
or worse), and a great array of games
that threaten to blow the cobwebs
out of the works. We’ve got he Last
of Us, Borderlands 2 and Bioshock: In-
finite leading the charge, but backed
up by a slew of smaller releases, such
as Dead Space 3, Monaco, FarCry 3
(plus Blood Dragon) and Dishonored.
I just wish I had more time and space
to talk and play about more of them.
As always, the casualties of war are
young and the killing blow happens
suddenly. Aliens: Colonial Marines
had so much promise, but shot it-
self in the foot with a smart-gun, and
SimCity, well... ‘nuff said.
he Games section of Felix would
have been way more boring and sar-
castic, if it wasn’t for the rest of the
Games and Felix teams, so I extend
my heartfelt thanks to them, for
keeping these pages relatively clean
(it’s surprisingly easy to start compli-
menting a game, and then quickly slip
into describing the developer’s moth-
ers in a less than desirable light...),
so to you guys, I raise my glass (of
Ribena).
his year, being Games Editor has
been a great experience, and I’ve had
way too much fun procrastinating
from the life of an Imperial student, it
should be illegal. I’ve gone to BAFTA
viewings, gaming conventions and
had review copies thrown at me, all
in the name of ‘journalism’.
I don’t know who is going to be my
replacement, but I know that the next
year promises all the goodies (and
baddies) we’ve seen from E3, and
whoever feels like taking up the man-
tle as Editor, is going to have a great
year ahead of them. If any of you are
interested, drop us a line!
It was a triumph! I’m making a note
here: huge success....
A most spectacular journey
