If your idea of fun consists of Mar-
lon Wayans dry-humping three cute
stuﬀed animals for an extended pe-
riod of time in various positions, you
should go right ahead and watch this
horror movie spoof that pretty much
does nothing right.
he Paranormal Activity franchise
and he Devil Inside are the two main
ﬁlms that this gets its ideas from; we
see a couple (Wayans and Atkins)
move into a new home and ﬁnd su-
pernatural occurrings haunting their
everyday life.
We get fart jokes, sex jokes, defeca-
tion, misogyny and homophobia, and
no matter how hard everyone tries,
it’s Wayans’ constantly over-the-top
performance that gets quickly tire-
some and a long list of jokes that nev-
er really stick. Forte has moments as
the Hispanic maid, but not enough.
Much like the ﬁlms it wants to
make fun of, there’s too much time
lingering over nothing, and often you
want the ﬁlm to just get on with it
and make us laugh.
Sadly the laughs never do come,
and thankfully when it’s all over in
86 minutes, you’ll want to avert your
eyes and attention to something of
more quality. Let’s just say, it’s worse
than the Scary Movie ﬁlms – now
that’s a pretty new low.
his year’s Bridesmaids? Not quite,
but it’s a wedding comedy that can
proudly stand on its own two feet. It’s
funny, ﬁlthy, and bold, with quirky,
unlikable but redeemable charac-
ters played by actors who can handle
comedy.
High school best friends Regan
(Dunst), Gena (Caplan) and Katie
(Fisher) are shocked to hear their
plus-sized “friend” Becky (Wilson) is
getting married, before any of them.
hey all come together, not hav-
ing grown up one bit since their high
school days, wanting to get drunk and
high living up to their glory years.
What’s diﬃcult is that the world
has moved on and they haven’t. It’s
diﬃcult to see just how these three
navigated their way through life after
their teenage years, but when such
dynamic characters come together,
you know you’ll get trouble.
A stupid, drunken evening leads
to a ripped wedding dress, which is
every bride’s worst nightmare. he
good news is, Becky has no idea, and
they have until the next morning to
get this ﬁxed.
hey ﬁnd new love and renewed
friendships along the way, and per-
haps ﬁnally, the three will snap out of
their fantasy lives and grow up. And
there’s fun to be had getting there.
Released from prison after almost
spending three decades locked up,
Val (Pacino) is looking for some good
time (i.e. sex, drugs, guns) with his
buddies Doc (Walken) and Hirsch
(Arkin). What complicates his night-
out is that Doc has been tasked with
killing Val and delivering his body to
a crime boss.
With a cast this good, it’s a shame
they don’t have anything better to do
than visit a brothel three times, take
a few too many viagra pills, go to a
bar, and a diner. We’re asked to be-
lieve this may be Val’s last ever day
on Earth and yet there’s nothing re-
motely interesting about what these
three old timers get up to. here is
the predictable running gag that hint
at the fact that these guys are “too old
for this shit” and the script doesn’t go
any further to equip these fantastic
actors with anything better to say.
Awkwardly stirring up false senti-
mentally to bring about closure for
the characters doesn’t really work,
as proper links are never established.
And so both a sudden death and in-
troduction of family members feel
incredibly forced.
But despite the mind-numbingly
dull script, it’s always worth sticking
around for some banter between Pa-
cino, Walken and Arkin.
Japanese director Kitamura’s second
English-language feature is as bloody
and shocking as his previous ﬁlm he
Midnight Meat Train, but also just as
shallow. here will be blood, tons of
it, with all the gore very stylishly han-
dled, although when it comes to ex-
plaining the characters themselves,
the ﬁlm falls massively short.
A gang of violent thugs meet their
match when a man they kidnap for
money is far from a helpless city
worker they ﬁrst thought he was. In
fact Driver (Luke Evans) has secrets
of his own (i.e having a woman locked
up in the trunk of his car) and pos-
sesses skills that make it instantly
obvious that they messed with the
wrong man.
Evans is a convincing anti-hero of
very few words, and his sharp charis-
ma is enough to dominate the screen.
here’s also a certain amount of sat-
isfaction to be gained seeing so many
vile individuals meet their deserving
gruesome ends.
Brieﬂy glossing over the psychol-
ogy of the Driver and his relationship
with his captives makes the audience
wonder, but our curiosity is never
properly addressed after its hasty
wrap-up of all things violent.
Everything is very slickly put to-
gether but the content is barely there.
Halle Berry is a 911 operator hav-
ing undergone a traumatic event six
months beforehand of listening to
a young girl get murdered, Abigail
Breslin is a girl who’s kidnapped and
calling her now from the boot of the
car, and the two communicate trying
to ﬁgure out the best solution to this
little problem.
Here’s an expertly made thriller,
one that cleverly makes use of its
tight, claustrophobia-inducing space,
and a highly probable scenario.
Berry is very convincing at portray-
ing the concerned helper, whereas
Breslin, making a successful transi-
tion from a child star to a potentially
successful adult actress, is an excel-
lent victim, crying and screaming at
all the right moments and selling the
sheer terror. Eklund is the suitably
creepy villain who has his own rea-
sons for what he’s doing.
hings only get problematic in the
ﬁlm’s third act, when there is an at-
tempt to turn Berry’s character into
a lone female detective and an even-
tual action heroine. She does her own
investigation piecing things together,
coming to conclusions based on the
most ridiculous and absurd clues.
he ﬁnal scene does open things up
for a potential sequel: and to this, we
say hell yes, go for it.
Nope, that wasn’t a fart
I’m as mad as hell and I’m not
going to take this anymore!!!!
Yeap, I swallowed...
What was I thinking,
accepting Catwoman..?
We like to drink with Al...!!
