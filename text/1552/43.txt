Against the picturesque backdrop of
Windsor Castle and loyally donning
the club’s apparel, Imperial 1st XI
put out one of its strongest line-ups
to play against Windsor Cricket Club.
Captain Jayanth Ganapathy, a former
player for the opposition, elected to
bat ﬁrst on a good batting wicket with
a fast outﬁeld.
here were high expectations for
ex-Windsor veteran Vishal Nair, hav-
ing scored a century on this ground
just last year, but was sent back to the
dressing room for just 10. Lomas Per-
sad, deprived of the strike and eager
to get oﬀ the mark, was sent back in
the very next over nicking an away-
swinger through to the keeper. Two
overs later, current Windsor 2nd XI
player Mohit Kulkarni provided an
action-replay of Lomas’ dismissal to
continue the poor start for Imperial.
With his side in trouble at 18 for
3, Jayanth joined Iain Stobbs for a
momentum-shifting partnership of
54. Iain smacked ten fours in his au-
thoritative 47 oﬀ 45 balls before be-
ing removed by one that darted back
into his middle stump. he scoring
rate stunted, Jayanth played a cap-
tain’s knock to rebuild and anchor
the innings, well supported by Joe
O’Gorman who contributed with
31. Both played smart cricket, ro-
tating strike constantly while at the
same time putting away the bad balls
when they came. However, disaster
struck when he was on 81 and given
out to a very dubious LBW decision
– just as he was looking to acceler-
ate towards his century. With wickets
tumbling at the other end, Vignesh
Venkateswaran, the last of the ex-
Windsor players, struck some lusty
blows including a couple of ﬂicks for
six in his quick-ﬁre 32 oﬀ 20 before
holding out at long-on on the penul-
timate ball – Imperial 209 all out.
Action resumed immediately in the
second innings with club president
Sid Kohli opening the bowling with
his oﬀ-breaks. Leggie Arvind Raja-
gopalan shared the not-so-new ball,
a move that seemed to surprise the
opposing team. It turned out to be
a good call in the fourth over when
Arvind got a ﬂighted delivery to dip
drastically, clean bowling the wild-
swinging batsman. However, runs
continued to ﬂow from both ends
even after Vignesh was introduced
into the attack, his ﬁrst two overs go-
ing for 16 runs. Nitin Nihalani had a
mixed start to his spell giving away
11 runs in his ﬁrst three deliveries
before ﬁnally producing the break-
through on the fourth.
Making up for his poor start, Vi-
gnesh produced a wicket-maiden in
the very next over to put the pressure
back on Windsor. An entertaining
period of play ensued with Vignesh
giving nothing away at one end but
Windsor CC too easy for IC
Nitin giving away a boundary an
over but also producing a chance for
a wicket every over, most of which
were dropped. Nevertheless, Wind-
sor collapsed, losing three wickets
including two to Vignesh in consecu-
tive balls in the ﬁnal over of his spell.
Joe and Lomas were brought in to
complete the all-spin attack and ﬁn-
ish oﬀ the innings. Windsor strug-
gling at 6 wickets down for a little
over 100 countered with a few bound-
aries before Joe got the breakthrough
in his second over and Lomas rattled
through the tail to give Imperial a
solid 50-run win.
