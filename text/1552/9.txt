FRIDAY 21 JUNE
Trinidad and Tob-away-we-go
During the end of 2011, when Europe
suﬀered the worst economic crises in
decades, the Republic of Trinidad and
Tobago was removed from the list of
Developing Countries by the OECD.
Last month, I was one of the 40 stu-
dents from Imperial College London
who headed to Trinidad and Tobago
to discover ﬁrst-hand the magnitude
of this development. We are grateful
to our sponsors and hosts; Schlum-
berger, Petrotrin, Tucker Energy Ser-
vices, University of Trinidad and To-
bago, Total S.A., BP, Challenge Energy,
iPoint LLC, Royal Dutch Shell, Hess
Corporation, OPC and SPE for their
generosity in making this trip a huge
success. Also, we are thankful to Impe-
rial College London Earth Science and
Engineering Department and Imperial
College London Mechanical Engineer-
ing Department for helping us procur-
ing PPE.
Having just completed the highly in-
tense MSc taught course and ﬁnished
our ﬁnal exams (with only the thesis to
follow), we departed on our transatlan-
tic journey from London Gatwick Air-
port on Sunday morning. We crossed
the pond and arrived in the beautiful
city of Port Of Spain later the same
evening.
Early the next morning, we met a
Petrotrin representative who led the
way to the Petrotrin Learning Cen-
tre. Here we were given an overview
of Petrotrin’s complex organisational
past and the history of petroleum in
Trinidad and Tobago, which links back
to the Pitch Lake discovery. his was
followed by a drive-through tour of the
Pointe-à-Pierre Reﬁnery and a visit to
the Pointe-à-Pierre Wild Fowl Trust.
he Wild Fowl Trust is a not for proﬁt,
environmental, non-government or-
ganisation dedicated to environmen-
tal education and the conservation
of wetlands and waterfowl. We were
fortunate to be welcomed there by
Petrotrin’s President (also the son of
the former President of the Republic of
Trinidad and Tobago) who described
his journey from the university class-
room to his post at Petrotrin. We were
given a fascinating and enlightening
guided tour of the grounds, which
incorporated a number of nature-in-
spired life lessons, including one based
upon the existence of the simple lily
pad. his wetlands plant begins life
growing underwater and then eventu-
ally emerges to the surface, where it
can ﬂourish. his represents the senti-
ment that: to really succeed you must
keep trying, never give up and eventu-
ally you will ﬁnd success in your en-
deavours.
he next day we visited the Trinmar
base, to visit two live oﬀshore produc-
tion platforms. After attending the
safety brieﬁng at the base, we boarded
the boat with full PPE and headed to
the oﬀshore. his was a great experi-
ence as we could see live production
of hydrocarbons and witness the sepa-
ration processing facilities ﬁrst hand;
something that we had been study-
ing only a few short days before! One
of the key take-away learnings from
this experience was the importance
of safety in the oil industry, which is
maintained not only at the ﬁeld but in
the oﬃce as well.
Upon arriving back on dry land, we
immediately went to he University
of Trinidad and Tobago campus in
San Fernando; where we met with the
university SPE representatives. he
evening allowed all of us from Impe-
rial College to meet our future indus-
try colleagues from Trinidad in an
informal setting and to learn of UTT’s
Petroleum/Reservoir Engineering pro-
grammes and the current SPE activi-
ties in Trinidad.
Our third and last day with Petrotrin
was spent at the Beach Camp, where
we were treated to a drive-by tour of
some Petrotrin onshore facilities – in-
cluding steam ﬂooding and water in-
jection.
We were then ready to visit our next
host, Schlumberger. he day began
with an arrival and safety introduction,
and a presentation about the company
by the region’s General Manager. his
was followed by other presentation
about few of the service lines in the
company by their respective repre-
sentatives, including D and M (Drilling
and Measurements), SIS (Schlumberg-
er Information Solutions), DCS (Data
and Consulting Services), WG (West-
ernGeco) and WL (Wireline). During
the tour of the base we were able to
see and learn about the various equip-
ment run downhole, thousands of feet
subsurface. Seeing the equipment up-
close excellently complimented the
classroom theory.
Next stop: Pitch Lake, the largest
natural bitumen / asphalt seep deposit
in the world. he Pitch Lake is located
in southwest Trinidad in the village of
La Brea, consisting of black and vis-
cous liquid asphalt with a semisolid
surface, which we could walk on. he
guide described that it was possible
for an individual to slowly sink if they
stood on the surface too long, credit-
ing how soft the asphalt is! I, person-
ally, had the opportunity to put a stick
through the asphalt and remove the
liquid tar. However, only a few days
later, I noticed that my show was dam-
aged permanently, as the tar had dried
up.
Our ﬁnal day in Trinidad was spent
with Tucker Energy Services. he
group was split into two; with half of
us going to the Wireline facility in Ota-
heite and the other half to the Cement-
ing facility in Chaguaramas. his was
a real-life experience with no veneer,
which included a tour of the cement-
ing laboratory, the chance to climb in-
side a cased-hole wireline truck and to
handle the equipment used during the
perforation process.
Having thoroughly enjoyed our week
in (highly industrial) Trinidad, we
then hopped on the ferry and sailed to
beautiful Tobago. Here we were able to
spend a couple of days relaxing, explor-
ing the picturesque island and meeting
some lovely local people. In this short
time many of us were able to go snor-
kelling, enjoy the water sports, scuba
dive, go deep-sea ﬁshing, kayaking and
even jump (safely!) from a waterfall.
he trip was an overwhelming suc-
cess and on behalf of the entire SPE
Imperial College student body can say
that the experience really did succeed
in strengthening our classroom knowl-
edge through ﬁrst-hand experience of
how the petroleum industry works.
I would like to unreservedly thank
our hosts and primary sponsors for
making the trip possible!
Last, but not the least, I would like
to thank the two bus drivers, Bas and
Frankie, who were full of joy and made
our journeys entertaining!
Help Soup Run feed London’s homeless
Homelessness is probably London’s
most visible social problem. We all
see it daily, in the men and women
who spend their days with a paper
cup, begging for spare change in the
capital’s allleyways. Some of us ignore
them – after all, we can’t possibly
help them all. Some of us give them
a smile, which always meets with kind
words, yet somehow this always leaves
us feeling unfulﬁlled.
he Soup Run, however, have de-
cided to do more. A small group of
committed students, I discovered,
spend every Sunday evening gather-
ing and distributing food to the home-
less on the streets. No one is quite sure
how many homeless people there are
in London – estimates vary but gen-
erally fall in the range of 250 to 700.
Not all of them sleep rough, but many
do; exposed to the elements and the
abuse and the poverty that seems far
too common on the streets. On a giv-
en evening, the soup run might feed
somewhere between ﬁfty and eighty
people, representing a sizeable frac-
tion of those sleeping rough.
he homeless in London have a rep-
utation for being rude, obnoxious and
uneducated. None of those stereo-
types could be further from the truth.
Having been on many soup runs this
year, and having spoken to people who
have been doing the runs for many
years, it’s safe to conclude that many
of them are amongst the kindest and
most genuine people that you could
meet.
If you handed a surplus, slightly
squashed sandwich as dinner to most
people, they’d probably be insulted
and give you a funny look. But to
someone who can’t even aﬀord the
bread to make that same sandwich,
the smile on their face is often enough
to make the entire evening’s eﬀort
worthwhile (the sandwich would be
even better with soup – but giving
that out is not allowed for safety rea-
sons. Talk about H&S gone mad!)
It’s not all that rosy though.
Understandably, the
people who use
the runs be-
come upset
when we run
out of food,
which is an
all too com-
mon occurrence.
For many of them,
a small sliver of cake
from PAUL’s South
Kensington bakery would
probably be the nicest thing they’d get
to eat all week.
Sadly PAUL, for some undisclosed
and confusing reason, stopped supply-
ing the run with food, leaving it strug-
gling. PAUL’s surplus food went a long
way to making sure that everyone got
at least some carbohydrates to make
it through the freezing winter nights
on the streets of Holborn. Without
this essential supplier, Soup Run must
simply hope that they see how impor-
tant their contribution is
and once again begin
donating their un-
sold food whilst
a t t e m p t i n g
other desperate
means of pro-
curement.
his, coupled
with the recent (de-
feated) proposal by
some management group
representatives at the last meet-
ing of the Clubs and Societies Board
to cut the Soup Run funding to zero
was deeply worrying. he committee
remain concerned about how they will
be able to fund the project, and pro-
cure the necessary amount of food.
he hope is that in the ﬁnal week of
term, students will be able to donate
their unused food to the project and
perhaps be encouraged to volunteer
over the summer if they are around, or
over the course of the next year; giving
the club the support that it needs.
It does seem a shame that the future
of a club that contributes so much to
the local community should have to
worry about its most basic funding
and supplies, given that it helps those
in society who are amongst the most
vulnerable and open to exploitation.
My only hope is that by raising aware-
ness of the work that the Soup Run
does, we will be able to secure a com-
fortable future for the society and the
people we help.
If you would like to get involved with
the Soup Run, or have any materials
(sugar, plastic cups, chocolate powder
etc.) that you’d be interested in donat-
ing, please email icsouprun@gmail.
