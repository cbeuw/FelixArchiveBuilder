HOLLAND CLUB
REDEVELOPMENT
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
On Wednesday I had a tour of the
area that used to be the Holland Club.
he space is called Level 0. At the mo-
ment, extensive work is still going on,
and there is much left to do. It is deﬁ-
nitely, for all intents and purposes, a
building site; you have to sign in and
out and wear a high vis jacket and a
hard hat.
First of all, the entire inside has been
stripped down to the bare bones. he
internal walls have been knocked
down, the toilets removed, and the bar
taken out. When you ﬁrst walk in it is
hard to get your head around where
everything used to be. Once you’ve
got your bearings you notice that the
space looks quite large now. How-
ever, the area where the Holland Club
used to be looks a lot smaller than you
would expect.
he Project Manager explains where
everything used to be and what the
current plan is. He has given up his
time and ensured the space is safe for
us to look around, and for that I am
grateful. he entire layout will be ﬂex-
ible allowing it to be multifunctional.
he layout that patrons of the Hol-
land Club remember will not remain
the same. he bar counter will be
moved to the side that is straight in
front of you as you walk in. Perhaps
the largest change is that there will
be a divider, which will allow for the
aforementioned multifunctionality,
about half way across the room. he
room will be primarily an open space,
however there will be the ability for
the room to be divided when needed.
What could be worrying about this is
it being always left in just one position
and so being obsolete – it would be
quite an eﬀort to always be opening
and closing it. he main access point
will be moved to inside the Sherﬁeld
building, and the current entrance will
serve as a ﬁre exit.
here are also extensive renova-
tion works being done on the space in
general. he windows will be double-
glazed for a start; there will also be
the addition of new windows for more
light. he ventilation, which used to be
mechanical, is going to be upgraded.
his isn’t all that is going on. here
will be new activity spaces in the base-
ment, which can be booked by post-
graduates. At the moment I couldn’t
be taken down to see them as they are
still being worked on extensively. he
redevelopment of the Holland Club is
part of a bigger project to redevelop
Sherﬁeld Level 0. Perhaps this hints
that the decision was already made
well before the campaign to save the
Club. his could be supported by the
fact that members of Properties Man-
agement and Campus (formerly Com-
mercial) Services were found looking
around at 7am before the space had
been put out to tender; they said it was
to update records, which is normally
done at 7am without asking anyone’s
permission I assume...
I do get the sense that there are peo-
ple who are working hard to make
sure this is a going to be a
great space that postgradu-
ates can enjoy. hey do seem
to be thinking about what
will be a good facility, and
so it doesn’t look like it will
be all doom and gloom. hey
stress to me that the priority
is to make an attractive facil-
ity for staﬀ and postgradu-
ates.
It is just a shame that the
Holland Club couldn’t have
allowed to keep running the
bar, and generally a bit more
involved in the process. Say-
ing that, the mood boards re-
ﬂect that a pub feel is wanted
and there has been involve-
ment from the GSA and the
Union.
Holland Club Closure
he Holland Club was, in practice, a
pub on campus that postgraduates
and lecturers would frequent. It had
been inside Sherﬁeld for many years.
Although the only way for people who
didn’t know of its existence to tell
where it is was the discrete “Youngs”
sign outside, which has now been re-
moved.
Last academic year, the space that
the Holland Club occupied was put
out to tender after a feasibility study
into the use of the space. his eﬀec-
tively closed the Holland Club. his
caused widespread dismay and anger
in the postgraduate and staﬀ commu-
nity. here was a petition started to
save the Club. After bids from Impe-
rial companies (of which the only real
heavyweight is Taste Imperial, which
is the catering arm of Imperial College
London and run by Campus (formerly
Commercial) Services) the space went
to Campus Services. he Holland
Club started bidding but pulled out
at the second stage, hinting that the
main crux of that phase was catering
and not running a pub. College said
that their reason was the need for ex-
tra space to meet demands as the food
services could not cope with demand
and that postgraduates wanted extra
social space.
Holland Club now
he Holland Club was essentially a bar
and not a club or society. his means
that taking away its only facility could
have made it no longer exist. It was self
governed and run on a not-for-proﬁt
model. he Club has moved locations
before, but College refused to ﬁnd it
space, saying it could book space like
any other club. Of course they would
need something that is completely
diﬀerent from other clubs’ booking
needs (a dedicated bar area etc) as
they were a club whose raison d’être
was a friendly pub for staﬀ and post-
graduates to relax in. Kevin Young,
the bar manager who is aﬀectionately
known as Kev, has since started a pub
in Spain. he Holland Club has also
been on tour, taking over various pubs
in the South Kensington area.
