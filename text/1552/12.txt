FRIDAY 21 JUNE
Michael Llewellyn-Williams
Michael Llewellyn-Williams was Edi-
tor of Felix 1974-75. He has had a fan-
tastic life since being Felix Editor. He
has travelled the world, “made a tonne
of money” on the dot com wave, helped
create Archie the Scotch Skeleton,
worked with everyone from Carling
Black Label to NatWest to Visa and
BMW, written a book, and has had his
own company since 1998. He currently
lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, so I
had a conversation on Skype with him.
TA: How did you get involved in Fe-
lix?
MLW: I was Chemistry Dep Rep, so
I got involved in the Union that way.
In my third year I was a ﬂoor rep on
Council. I made a fuss about internal
communication or lack of it. hat led
me to stand for position of Editor. One
guy called Charlie Wrigley who was a
Guildsman opposed me; and interest-
ingly he withdrew the night before the
elections. So I got elected with no one
standing against
me.
TA: Why did
you run for
Editor?
MLW: Well
there was some-
thing about it. I
was interested
in writing, I
was interested
in working with
creativity and
deadlines. hat
found expres-
sion later in my
career when
after my PhD
I went straight
into advertis-
ing. Which was
again working
with creative
people and working against deadlines.
TA: As the Editor of Felix were you
then interested in the design aspect
as well as the writing?
MLW: I was always interested in the de-
sign aspect. I was just never very good
at it. I was more interested in writing. I
had kind of a feel for how I wanted the
pages laid out and the diﬀerent permu-
tations, but in terms of actually creat-
ing art from a blank sheet of paper it
was one of those things I would love to
do but I just wasn’t very good at it.
TA: Looking through it I think it
looks quite nice!
MLW: hanks. Understand that in my
year it was a big change. Previously
the Editor got all his copy together,
did a rough layout, then sent it all to a
printer in Dursley in Gloucestershire.
hey ﬁtted the copy to the space that
was there. hen the stuﬀ got delivered.
It really was just writing and editing in
those days, not production.
hen in 1974 suddenly the Editor had
to not only do the writing and the edit-
ing and put it all together, but he had
to physically lay out, print, fold, collate
and distribute the whole aﬀair as well.
hat was a huge change. I don’t know
if you saw the year before mine. It was
a much bigger format and it was pro-
fessionally printed. Mine was the ﬁrst
year where we were printing it our-
selves. We had a professional printer
guy called Kyrle Gillespie. He ran the
machine and we had a lady called Gill
who did the typesetting. But even the
typesetting was mechanical, so she had
to type everything twice: once to get
the measure of the column width; and
then type it again so it became justiﬁed
– ﬁtting evenly to the column width.
So it was very time consuming and the
problems we had with just the printer
were a nightmare. We had to just get
on and make
the best of it.
TA: Yeah
I saw you
said how it
was the ﬁrst
time you
changed to
i n - h o u s e
production.
Now we’ve
s w i t c h e d
back. We do
the design
and send it
oﬀ to print-
ers up in
Cambridge.
MLW: Well
I can say I’m
very envious.
TA: Yeah, we
have a luxury. We do it on a screen
and the next day it’s delivered.
MLW: hat’s fantastic. It was all glue
and scissors for us.
TA: Any standout moments and
achievements from your year that
you’re really proud of?
MLW: I guess several things. When I
ﬁrst came into the oﬃce there was this
cupboard with lots of old issues of Felix
lying around. I thought who the heck is
taking care of all these? And there was
no rhyme or reason as to why they were
there. So I decided to create a library
of all the past issues and it was then I
decided we needed to get these things
preserved. I even had to go to the Col-
lege Archivist. And ﬁnally put together
a complete thing, and I had it bound in
the black buckram with the gold letter-
ing. So that actually started in my year.
It also started a tradition where people
working on the newspaper collected
their own issues for that year and had
them bound in black buckram as well.
I’ve still got my own copy and three or
four copies for the years after that as I
was still there until 1978.
Also during my year it was the 25th
anniversary of the newspaper. So we
had a big 25th anniversary dinner. I
remember Hargreaves who was the
second Editor came over from Hol-
land. He spoke at the dinner but he
didn’t really know what he was doing
- I think he’d had too much sherry. He
was ﬂoundering a bit. I had to help him
out and that was kind of fun.
It was also during that time that one
of the past Editors wrote back that he
couldn’t attend the anniversary din-
ner – I think he was in South Africa. In
his letter he talked about keeping Felix
free, as it used to have a cover price of
six (old) pence. hey had fought for it to
be free to students so it got subsidised
by the Union. Anyway, this past Editor
signed oﬀ his letter with “Keep the cat
free”. It was something that stuck with
us. At that point it was about the cover
price. And that’s where the motto came
from.
he other things were instead of just
reporting the news, we tried to create
some news. I don’t know if the Felix
Motor Rally is something you still have
but we started that. hat was enor-
mous fun.
We also had a Felix photo competi-
tion, which was fun too. he other
thing we decided to do was to create a
club. So we created the Felix Club. And
somehow mixed in with that was crea-
tion of the Felix coat of arms.
TA: One that is now relevant. Don’t
know how it was then. With the in-
ternet now, Twitter etc. Every year
there is something that explodes a
lot. How about complaints, did you
get many?
MLW: Oh God yes. One of the guys
who was working for me; he actually
became Editor a few years later. He was
a bit of an opportunist. An assistant
editor but wanted to do his own thing
instead of being part of a team. A pain
in the neck really. here was some rea-
son I had to let him go. Hoped he did
well as he was helping setting up IC Ra-
dio, but he just went oﬀ the deep end,
big time. He wasn’t a happy bunny. He
wrote these vitriolic letters every week,
which we all sat around and laughed at
in the Union Bar. He was a one-man
hate mail machine. It got very silly
(laughs). Just went on and on and on.
he other thing was we were getting
criticised for not having enough news
content in the newspaper. his was
particularly in the ﬁrst term. As the
printing production was such a night-
mare. here were several times when
we didn’t think we could get the news-
paper out.
he big production night was hurs-
day. One of those hursday nights I re-
member it being 2am and the printing
machine had broken down. he printer
was saying “it’s the spring, it’s broken,
and we can’t ﬁnd another spring at
this time of night.” I was despondent
and looking at my desk, and it had an
angle-poise lamp on it. hey operate
with springs. So I said, “Hold on a min-
ute, what about this spring here?” He
said, “Let’s have a look” and then we
ﬁtted this spring from the angle-poise
lamp into the printing machine and it
worked. So ﬁnally we were able to ﬁn-
ish printing and at 5am we were deliv-
ering newspapers at the diﬀerent drop
oﬀ points around the college.
TA: Same hours now, just in a slight-
ly diﬀerent way. In front of a com-
puter not a printing press! Did your
year as Editor prepare you for your
future career at all?
MLW: I think it did have an impact on
what I subsequently did. I recall at the
end of my 3rd year in chemistry, I had
three choices: either doing Felix as the
Editor; accepting one of the jobs I’d
been oﬀered in marketing departments
in various companies; or doing a PhD
in polymer physical chemistry. I re-
member thinking “Which one should
I do?” In the end I said why not do all
three? So that’s how it worked out.
After Felix and the PhD, I then
looked at advertising as a career as I
thought it might be fun and I might be
able to hook up with nice looking girls,
which, er, I did – a lot. One ad agency
was called BMP. hey were trying to
bring some science to advertising. So I
remember contacting them and I guess
I was lucky. hey had something like
3500 applicants and only hired 3 peo-
ple. I was fortunate enough to be one of
Ex-Editor interviews
those. he rest they say is history.
I do freelance work for various cli-
ents now. Huge project I’m working on
right now is going to launch next year.
It’s so conﬁdential I can’t even tell me
wife!
I don’t think I’d have done any of that
had I not had the experience of Felix.
It gave me some real life experience
working with mad, creative people.
Working to deadlines because (to para-
phrase Dr Johnson): “Nothing concen-
trates the mind quite like a hanging”.
I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be where
I am now if it hadn’t been the time I’d
spent at Felix.
TA: A quick word about what you do
now and what BrandMechanics is?
MLW: What I do these days is mostly
focused on brand strategy and work-
ing with clients mostly in the U.S. and
sometimes in Europe and Asia. hree
years ago, I was doing a brand essence
workshop in China and half the par-
ticipants had to have translators from
Mandarin into English and back again
– great fun! Basically I help companies,
big and small, to deﬁne how they want
to be perceived in the future, and then
turning that into reality.
I’ve found over the years that I’ve de-
veloped a good balance between left-
and right-brain thinking, between ana-
lytical and creative thought processes.
And you know I think my time at Im-
perial was very helpful in both those
areas: the science itself and the creative
craziness of editing Felix!
TA: hank you so much for giving up
so much of your time!
MLW: Check out my website when you
get a moment: www.brandmechanics.
