14 FRIDAY 21 JUNE
Pallab Ghosh
Pallab Ghosh was Felix Editor from
1983/84. He is currently a science
correspondent at the BBC. I met him
in the BBC oﬃces. When he was Edi-
tor they printed in their in house print
shop and the Editor was also the man-
ager of the print shop, who printed
club leaﬂets.
TA: Something I’ve noticed is that
there is a general underlying tone,
but there are changes from year to
year. One year it’s a bit more light
hearted, then the next year it’s a bit
more serious. How did you choose
that?
PG: Yes it tends to go like that. I took
my inspiration from a guy called Ste-
ve Marshall, who was Editor when I
was a ﬁrst year. He had this certain
approach (humour). he Editors
who followed him were a bit more
straightforward. hey wanted to kind
of distinguish themselves by not hav-
ing the same approach. You only get
one shot at it and it’s great fun. So you
shouldn’t have any regrets at the end
of it.
TA: How did you get involved at Fe-
lix?
PG: I didn’t think of journalism or
newspapers as my thing. I was quite
keen on athletics. I went along to a
meeting of University of London Ath-
letics Club and there was no one there
– I probably turned up at the wrong
place. So I thought, I’ll have to ﬁnd
something else to do.
here was a guy across the hall from
me who was involved in the student
newspaper. So I got involved. he
Editor at the time lived in the same
halls, and he was nocturnal. So Pat-
rick would say “come along and meet
Steve”, and we’d go along to his room
and they’d get chatting and then he
said “come along and work on Felix
and do some collating”. I was very un-
der conﬁdent about my writing. I was
more there for the crack – as in the
Irish term, rather than something un-
toward going on. hen I got more into
it, did a bit of photography. When it
got to the end of my third year I hadn’t
been involved in that Editor’s Felix,
because he was far too straight laced
and whatever and not part of what Fe-
lix was about. So I decided to put my-
self forward as Editor, because I really
liked the layout and design.
TA: My lecturer Alan Armstrong
told me that you produced the halls’
newsletter actually.
PG: Yes. It was this thing called the
Wellsian. he newsletter of the H. G.
Wells society, which we created while
I was there. It just gave me a taste
of doing layout and design, which I
loved. Back then, the production was
one of the main things that the Edi-
tor did. Obviously, he gave it an edito-
rial direction, but I thought if I got a
staﬀ of writers I could manage. hen
when I got elected I redesigned the
paper and I got other people to write
the news stories. I hoped that my
girlfriend at the time would write the
editorial. She was too busy so I had
to do it myself. It was with one hour
to go and I wrote it and it was ﬁne.
It was just this thing in my head that
made me think I couldn’t write, then
I found out I quite enjoyed writing. I
thoroughly enjoyed it.
So I just drifted into it [being Editor]
and because I enjoyed Felix and liked
the journalism I decided to become a
journalist.
TA: Did
you do the
h e a d e r
yourself?
PG: I com-
missioned
someone to
do it. I was
into lay-
out myself
but with
the logo it’s
good to do
that. It was
s o m e o n e
who wanted
to be a pro-
f e s s i o n a l
g r a p h i c
d e s i g n e r.
We had a
chat and it
was just something bright, and a new
dawn, and I wanted the cat on.
TA: he logo changing so much is
really weird. I remember my broth-
er trying to give me advice and tell-
ing me I shouldn’t change the logo.
I said look at the issue archive they
change the logo every year.
PG: here’s the sense that he Times
you don’t get them changing the logo
because it’s the brand. But that’s the
biggest way you can make your mark.
TA: I think with Felix the name is
the brand. What it looks like chang-
es year by year, and that’s almost
part of the brand that it changes
year by year.
PG: Yeah, because you don’t get Edi-
tors changing at he Times every year.
TA: Any standout moments from
your year? News stories or features
that you think came oﬀ well?
PG: Well. I’m the only Felix Editor
that riled the Rector so much that
they brought out their own newspa-
per against me! It was just generally a
body of work that rattled lots of cages
and got a reaction. Everyone was in-
volved in Felix in one way or another.
hey’d rush to open it to see who had
been slagged oﬀ, who hadn’t been.
You know, obviously the news is im-
portant, but with a student newspa-
per it should be part of the commu-
nity. If I were to describe what I felt
proud of it would be that everyone
was engaged in it. We couldn’t print
more than a certain number of copies
as we’d exceed our budget, but they
were gone by 9:30 – ﬁrst lectures.
TA: Looking back on stories that
seemed to be
very important,
how important
do they seem in
hindsight?
PG: Well, there
was a story
about a student
who had com-
mitted suicide,
which was a se-
rious story. We
produced a spe-
cial issue on that
– I don’t know if
it made it to the
bound editions
[which are big
editions that has
every paper in
one place]. Most
of the time it was
reporting the
news. here were
no big standout moments. My Felixes
were more magaziny. here was a bit
of news, which was reported.
We ran a campaign to save a tea
room. It was the Head of Biology who
was trying to shut it down so we por-
trayed him as Hitler.
TA: So what stories stand out as big
stories from your year?
PG: So there was the student who was
shot dead. It turned out he had killed
himself. So that was challenging to re-
port that.
here was a pornography show that
the RSM used to show. And one of
the students campaigned against it.
It doesn’t bear thinking about these
days that the RSM used to invite
these strippers along and show por-
nographic ﬁlms, some of which were
kind of very hardcore, involving ani-
mals and so forth.
TA: hat was allowed?
PG: Exactly. It seems bizarre. One of
the students campaigned against it.
So that was a
good running
story. I had
some good
running sto-
ries I think.
Stories that
matter to peo-
ple. You’re at
the mercy of
that happen-
ing. Quite a
lot of the time
the news can
be slow or un-
interesting, so
you’ve got to
make sure that
the rest of the
newspaper ’s
entertaining in
some way.
TA: Did you do that with the rest of
the paper? Make sure it’s entertain-
ing so there’s always something fun
for people to read.
PG: Yeah there’s always something fun
for people to read and it looked good.
You know, whether there was good
news or not. But news is the thing that
people care most about.
TA: Were people ever upset by what
was in the paper? Did you ever get
any complaints?
PG: Oh I got loads of letters of com-
plaints, which I published (laughs).
Some of them were written in the right
spirit – a bit of banter back – but I got
complaints, and I published them. It
made for a lively letters section.
TA: At the time did you feel upset,
I mean, I can’t imagine you found it
fun to receive those?
PG: Oh it was! I deliberately set out
to upset people and it was sort of
great satisfaction to me that they were
(laughs).
TA: Did Felix prepare you for your
career in science journalism? Is it
diﬀerent how you do things now
compared to back then?
PG: he process is the same. You have
a sense for what people care about and
you talk to them about it and you re-
port it. hat’s the same now as it was
hundreds of years ago. One of the
things Felix does teach you at an early
age is the stories. Once upon a time
people used to leave school and work
on the local paper and work for the
local radio stations doing the basics;
they’d learn what stories were. Now
Ex-Editor interviews
people do journalism courses it’s all
about the academia of impact of news
and that sort of thing. Many editors
complain that people don’t know what
stories are. If you’re an editor, you’ve
got a community, you know what
works, almost instinctively.
TA: Do you think working in Felix
gives you a sense of what students
care about and what they don’t
care about? And if they should care
about it, how to make them care?
PG: To be honest I think it was in-
stinctive. I just wrote about stuﬀ that
I found interesting and it worked. It
got a reaction and went to plan. So. I
think you know what you’ve learnt in
retrospect.
TA: Do you feel science journal-
ism and communication are going
through a renaissance period?
PG: Well ﬁrst of all I’d make a distinc-
tion between science journalism and
science communication. Communi-
cation is what NASA and CERN do.
hey feel like they have an obligation
to put on their websites – and I feel
the web has changed things a lot –and
also through the media explain what
they’re doing. But, at the end of the
day, it’s still propaganda. It’s for them
to show that they are doing the right
thing, that it’s important. I think even
with things like explaining the Higgs,
what science journalists need to do is
to ask awkward questions: has it really
been worth the money? Do these re-
sults really stand up? Is it all that it’s
cracked up to be? Unless science jour-
nalists do that there’s no reason for the
public to get their science news from
any other place than the NASA web-
site or Wellcome Trust website.
