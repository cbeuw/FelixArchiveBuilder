FRIDAY 21 JUNE
18
o, it has come to the end of
an era, well a year-long era.
Goodbye Tim and hello…
me. I’m sure the Supreme
Editor himself is feeling bit-
tersweet; it’s the end of a very tiring
year, but also the end of a year of fun
and boundless creativity.
As next year’s editor I’m already
feeling nervous, after all, only next
year’s incoming students will be free
of expectations, while the rest of you
will judge me by the standard of my
forebears, a worrying thought. I’ve al-
ready had a few ideas for next year’s
Felix, so watch out, this cat’s on ﬁre!
I’ll endeavour to uphold the high level
of Union scrutiny and clubs & society
involvement that Tim has propagated
over the last year, as well as debate on
key student issues such as the new
halls in Acton, the closure of the Hol-
land Club, the closure of Garden Hall
and the changes to the Union’s consti-
tution.
Next year I plan to bring in new sec-
tions to showcase local events (on and
oﬀ campuses) and provide careers in-
formation. I’ll hopefully be welcoming
some fresh blood on the editorial team
and pushing for more people to con-
tribute. Felix will be looking for copy
editors, section editors, online editors,
music reviewers, regular comment
writers and more. It could be you…!
Felix is also happy to start new sec-
tions, so if you think there’s a certain
missing element to the paper, email
me or drop down to the Felix Oﬃce in
the Beit Quad West Basement.
Another part of Felix I aim to im-
prove is the paper’s online presence.
Felix’s new online team will be provid-
ing news and entertaining information
during the week and over the holidays
so you don’t need to bother with the
Tab anymore. hrough Felix Online
you’ll also be able to read news, listen
to IC Radio and watch content pro-
duced by Imperial’s own STOIC TV
as well as take part in debates in the
comments section.
Felix could not be put together with-
out contributions and support from a
fantastic team of students. I’d like to
thank the team this year for the out-
standing content they’ve produced for
us to read and I only hope that I can
keep the legacy of Felix intact for an-
other year.
You Say Goodbye, I say Hello

2012 University Complaints (England & Wales) in 2012
kid you not. he title high-
lights a rise of 25% in com-
plaints lodged to the Oﬃce of
the Independent Adjudicator
from academic institutions in
England and Wales.
Numerous academics, journal-
ists and opinionated individuals ally
this increase with the inaugural year
of the £9,000 fee tariﬀ. One has to
consider the possibility that this is
a cop-out. You might even choose
to lament the fact that some people
are insistent on interlinking money
and cost with education. Some pos-
tulate that rising student antagonism
has spawned from the myopia of the
coalition Government, who choose
to view third level education as a hin-
drance rather than a help.
69% of complaints, as cited by he
Huﬃngton Post, related to academic
status, originating principally from
Business students and those aligned
with medical faculties More than half
of these (59%) were deemed ‘unjusti-
ﬁed’ by the OIA. he seventh succes-
sive annual increase was attributed to
challenges related to the profession-
alism of students and staﬀ regarding
misconduct and plagiarism.
he subtleties of the statistics prove
most intriguing. In my opinion fees
are only one component of the mat-
ter. Granted, the media coverage of
fee hikes awarded legitimacy and
even acted as a vehicle for student
antagonism and (as seen on London
streets a couple of years ago) acted
as tinder for the ﬁre. It signiﬁed the
Government’s oﬀ-loading of respon-
sibility (of their own volition) for pro-
viding a technically and intellectually
adept proletariat in the trivial pursuit
of a doomed policy of ﬁscal austerity.
TO WHAT END? All they have
produced is an unhealthy competi-
tion between prospective students,
whereby a ﬂawless set of A-Level (or
equivalent) grades may not guarantee
their place at university. Furthermore
a more anxious, apprehensive student
body has evolved from the wreck-
age, preoccupied with examinations
as the end-product of their studies
rather than the value of the education
they received. his has set the tempo
for the exponentially morphing grade
inﬂation whereby a 2-1 just doesn’t
cut it. Arguably we are already there.
London South Bank University
was, forgive me, named and shamed
by the OIA for failing to comply with
recommendations regarding the han-
dling of complaints and the associat-
ed mechanisms of compensation. To
quote a Mr. Behrens of the OIA, “We
go through quite a rigorous process
of alerting Universities to what they
have to do to avoid being named for
non-compliance”.
Avoid? AVOID? Here is a prime ex-
ample of the crux of current student
antagonism. All the rhetoric com-
ing from both the Government and
its associated bodies is negative and
debasing, conveying that the student
body is a nuisance that must be man-
aged rather than engaged.
I believe students as a whole (across
England and Wales) feel underval-
ued, merely ushered through the sys-
tem, like cattle to the abattoir. If the
Government were to wholeheartedly
proclaim academia as a cornerstone
of economic recovery (with convic-
tion), a national bastion of conﬁdence
in its bright young minds, those com-
plaints might just recede in future
years. It may just pass down from
the level of governance into the grass
roots.
