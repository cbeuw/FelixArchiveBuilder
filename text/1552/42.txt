Slitherlink Ophis
I convinced myself not to include Hashi for this issue, but I think removing the old
Slith’ would probably bring forth Ragnarok, ushering an era of doom for us all. Rules:
draw a single closed loop by vertically and horizontally joining the dots so that the
numbered squares are surrounded by the corresponding number of lines.
Answers to Riddle Time:
a) 942+942+942 b) 7

Fill the cells with a continuous line that does not pass through a cell twice, doesn’t
intersect with itself, and passes through all white boxes. The numbers show you
how many times the line turns in the corresponding row or column. The snake
enters and exits the grid at the shown points (and only those points). The two
grey squares have the same component.

Hitori
You’ve seen enough Hashi (or, as those who aren’t totalbaka gaijins call it,
Hashiwokakero), so the last issue for the year is as good a time as any* to
introduce another Japanese puzzle that only weeaboos care about: Hitori.
The rules: eliminate numbers so that every remaining number appears ex-
actly once in each row and column. The non-erased numbers must be all
be connected orthogonally (i.e. vertically or horizontally, but not diago-
nally), and erased numbers can’t be orthogonally adjacent. *no it’s not
