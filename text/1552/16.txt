FRIDAY 21 JUNE
FEBRUARY
Spring seemed to have sprung in sci-
ence, if not elsewhere during Febru-
ary, with flowers and butterflies re-
vealing their secrets to the biologists.
Flowers were proved to have a nega-
tive electrical charge to attract posi-
tively charged bumblebees in an ef-
fort to encourage pollen interactions.
Meanwhile it was found that migrat-
ing monarch butterflies use tempera-
ture to dictate flight
direction, monitored
by their internal
clocks.
Chemists discov-
ered a process for
extracting hydrogen from the fuel
methanol, which, due to being liquid,
allows it to be easily transported and
stored. hey also managed to produce
elastic, ultra light carbon foams with a
density lower than air; a busy month
for chemists if not for the love lives
of students at Imperial with a record
high of those residing in the library
rather than out on February the 14th.
Excitement for
physicists peaked this
month with a meteor
strike in the Russian
city of Chelyabinsk,
although the same
can not be said for the
city’s residents with
over a thousand people
injured. he explosion
was the equivalent of
around half a mega-
tonne of TNT and
is believed to be the
largest object to strike
Earth since 1908.
MARCH
March was a busy month for science
and students at Imperial alike. Neuro-
scientists, continuing with their pre-
vious success in research, discovered
the source of migraines. In contrary to
popular belief that these were caused
by repetitive hounding from Union
hacks badgering you to vote in the Big
Election, they were actually found to
be due to waves of cellular depolarisa-
tion in the cortex.
With the approach of ﬁnal year pro-
jects and exams for third year biolo-
gists also came a paper determining
how sleepless nights can aﬀect gene
activity, much to their dismay. Genes
concerning immune and stress re-
sponses are in particular negatively
aﬀected by sleep deprivation; again
yet another
reason why
maybe some-
times it is ok
to sleep on
the library
floor during
tedious revi-
sion sessions.

that mice pre-
formed bet-
ter on learn-
ing tasks and

gation when

brain cells,
so at least we
could claim
we are cleverer than the rodents this
month.
As biologists were slogging away in
the library, chemists were having a
APRIL
MAY
April was an exciting month for Im-
perial – researchers from the De-
partment of Medicine identiﬁed new
mutations in the bird flu virus, H5N1,
that allow for it to replicate more
readily in mammals.
Meanwhile, at Imperial’s National
Heart and Lung institute, a study on
stem cells allowed for the identiﬁca-
tion of possible treatment for those
suﬀering from the bleeding disorder,
von Willebrand Disease (vWD). vWD
is caused by a malfunctioning clotting
factor, but using stem cells, research-
ers were able to pinpoint exactly what
defects were present in diﬀerent pa-
tients, and hopefully develop tailored
therapy.
Such ﬁndings may have come at a
price however; this month saw the
BUAV posting ﬁndings of animal mis-
treatment within the labs based at the
Hammersmith campus, causing our
own golden boy, Brian May, to im-
plore Imperial to stop animal testing.
With students more engaged with
their revision than the video of mice
being guillotined however, this blip in
Imperial’s scientiﬁc history went wide-
ly unnoticed; with even the College
itself oﬀering a half-hearted investiga-
tion into the matter, this has not been
heard from since. It is presumed the
undercover BUAV protester working
at the lab was ﬁred, although again
no one seemed to be too bothered to
check up on this fact.
On a happier note however, biolo-
gists found a new hormone within
the liver that spurs the growth of in-
sulin-secreting cells, which could be
manipulated for future treatment of
diabetes.
he hormone, named betatropin,
influences the beta cells of the liver
and alters their gene expression to
give them characteristics of their
neighbours, alpha cells, that already
make insulin.

c a mp u s
with its
usual fluid, unbroken sweep across
the library, bringing student activity
to a halt. Fortunately the same can’t
be said for scientiﬁc development in
May.
he 3D printer delivered results for
one particularly lucky six year old pa-
tient, with a windpipe produced using
the new technology. he windpipe
was printed in a biocompatible bio-
plastic and allowed Kaiba Glonfriddo
to breathe again without diﬃculty.
To the relief of both culinary con-
noisseurs and the historians out there,
the pathogen that was the cause of
the Irish Potato Famine was ﬁnally
identiﬁed as a strain of Phytophthora
infestans. Identiﬁcation of the DNA
of this pathogen was done using 11
historically preserved specimens, al-
though they can gladly say that the
strain that caused the famine may now
be extinct.
It also seemed this month that
BUAV really didn’t have a lasting ef-
fect in their campaign to stop animal
testing, with 4,00 people signing an
online petition in May to support the
scientists in the University of Milan.
Research facilities were invaded by ac-
tivists (not the BUAV) in April, with
them taking around 100 animals and
delaying research substantially, and it
being predicted that it will take years
to redo work.
hese are only a few of the great sci-
entiﬁc advances this year, and, with an
increase in the technology available, it
is likely that such scientiﬁc landmarks
are only going to be coming thicker
and faster than ever. he same may or
may not be said next year’s Freshers.

P h y s i -
cists too
were getting very excited this month,
with evidence of the Higgs Boson be-
ing found in CERN. he Higgs Boson
may be able to provide a way in which
particles gain mass, although its nick-
name of he God Particle is mislead-
ing – with the boson unable to shed
any light on the existence of any sort
of omnipotent entity. Regardless of its
weaknesses concerning religious out-
pourings, it can still be beneﬁcial to
many elements of theoretical physics.
An infant was also successfully
cured of HIV in March using antiviral
drugs, after being born with the ret-
rovirus. he secret to the treatment
was the speed at which it was ad-
ministered, with drugs taken from 30
hours after birth. Unfortunately, this
progress into HIV research was some-
what counteracted when an anti-HIV
trial failed due to subjects not actually
taking the drug being tested, leading
to an inconclusive determination of
whether the drug tenofovir actually
works.
