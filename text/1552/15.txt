OCTOBER
Biologists took the lead in October
by constructing a Tree of Life con-
structed for all 9,993 living bird spe-
cies, discovering spitting fish that
catch insects from the air and teach-
ing three bears to count.
It is less likely biologists at Imperial
were as active, however with the first
years undertaking their first practical
of feeding the ducks in Hyde park.
hat’s not to say biologists have
been perfect in the past – “penis
worms,” or priapulids, as they are
Blue whales seemed to be the stars of
November with a study showing that
they actually pirouette underwater
before lunging at patches of krill from
below. Such moves displayed more
grace than those oﬀered by freshers
when they ventured across London to
go to Fabric for the first and last time
this month, with many finding they are
still not prepared for the wider world
It was found out how life emerges
at hydrothermal vents in December
with a hypothesis formulated about
how the vents could form rudimen-
tary proton gradients. Such a gradi-
ent is thought to form as the oceanic
water meets the alkaline water from
vents within mineral walls in the
2013 seems to be the year for neuro-
science; January kicked oﬀ with the
identification of the loss of cells within
the cortex being responsible for de-
creasing sleep quality and a poorer
long-term memory. his was actively
displayed in those sitting January ex-
ams, although was oﬀset by certain
students thinking it was appropriate
to nap in the Library between study
sessions.
To further torment the minds of
more commonly referred
to in the lab to avoid break-
outs of sniggering, may
have thrown previous evo-
lutionary work into disre-
pute.
Analysis of the gene expression of
the penis worm in October showed
it developed diﬀerently than once
thought, meaning it may have to
be renamed (upsettingly) and also
moved about in the phylogenetic tree.
Meanwhile, a model predicted that
the Moon was probably created from
a collision between the Moon and
another orbiting body; this was also
supported by the fact that the Moon
and the Earth have a very similar
chemical composition.
A more accurate carbon-14 clock
sample was extracted from the Lake
Suigestu in Japan, whilst Archae-
ologists demonstrated that the stone
statues on Easter Island may have
“walked” across the hills as opposed
to being built on site. Structural fea-
tures of the statue indicated they
were rocked back and forth across
the island before settling them down
in their final location.
And finally, here in Britain, the
badger cull was delayed by the gov-
ernment, despite badgers causing is-
sues via their transmission of bovine
tuberculosis, which was harming
cattle. Not only that, but a survey re-
vealed that only 63% of people sup-
port animal experimentation in the
UK, and this is on the decline.
Surprisingly, the survey was not
ran by Imperial’s friends the British
NOVEMBER
outside of
Metric.
A newly
d i s c o v -
ered black
hole was
found to be the equivalent mass of 17
billion Suns, although it has seemingly
squeezed its way into a galaxy only a
quarter of the size of the Milky Way.
Such a ratio of mass to size was also
quoted within a chat up line by a rath-
er desperate, zealous third year in 568,
although results remained inconclu-
sive in its eﬀectiveness.
In Chemistry, na-
noparticles that can
absorb sunlight then
reemit it as heat were
found to convert water
to steam when sub-
merged. Not only that,
thinner endoscopes
were developed using
single optical fibres,
with researchers at
Korea University dem-
onstrating their use by
making a map of a rat
intestine.
DECEMBER
rocks of the sea-
bed, allowing for
the conversion of
carbon dioxide
and hydrogen into
the basic building
blocks for life like nucleotides.
Christmas cheer came early this
month for virologists as it was an-
nounced that H5N1 research was to
be resumed, after lifting the mora-
torium placed back in January 2012.
Meanwhile, even ecologists seemed
to be making headway in their sci-
entific endeavours with the identi-
fication of the benefits for ﬂocks of
birds that are composed of diﬀerent
species.
Biologists in general seemed to be
having a productive month, with sec-
ond years at Imperial in particular
showing advanced
courtship skills at
the Christmas din-
ner and the RCSU
Ball afterwards.
JANUARY
those studying hard, se-
vere outbreaks of the fun-
gus that usually plaques
coﬀee plants ranged
across Central America.
Although the fungus He-
milia vastatrix doesn’t generally kill
coﬀee plants, it can halve the harvest,
and the Costa Rican government this
month enacted emergency legislation
to increase funding towards research
to combat the fungus.
Further government action in sci-
ence was seen in January, with Obama
renewing his commitment to climate
change in his second inaugural speech
and hoping to decrease greenhouse
gas emissions.
Still across the
pond, the US Na-
tional Institute of
Health (NIH) was
advised to retire
its 360 chimpan-
zees and shut down
half of its ongoing
animal experiments
due to suggestions
that only 50 should
suﬃce. Imperial re-
mained oblivious
to this, and heartily
continued its own
animal experiments,
whilst BUAV pre-
pared its assault.
Union Abolition Vivisection (BUAV),
but by the more creditable Ipsos
Mori, although this should have pro-
vided warning signs for the animal
testing facilities here on campus.

Again however, results remained in-
conclusive as to how inﬂuential such
skills were on the final copulation
probability.
In physics, a potential source of lo-
cal comets was identified on the edge
of the Solar System, known as the
Kuiper Belt, whilst the US meteorite
that crashed in California in April
was identified as the fastest on re-
cord. Physics did also take a sad turn
with CERN stopping the proton-pro-
ton collisions within the Large Had-
ron Collider, and the twin spacecraft
mapping the gravity field of the moon
coming to a halt in a controlled crash.
