LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.

The Editor of F e l i x .
Dear S i r ,
As chief executive of the Union, I must protest at your
e d i t o r i a l on the question of the November the f i f t h f i n e s .
It is l a i d down i n the Union Bye Laws that the executive
committee s h a l l concern i t s e l f with domestio matters and matters
of urgency only. The sum oollected by subscription up t i l l
January the twenty t h i r d was only s u f f i c i e n t to cover l e g a l
expenses incurred. The question of whether fines should be paid
out of Union funds was therefore one that should be referred t o
Council, f o r t h e i r decision or f o r t h e i r reference to a Union
General Meeting should they consider this necessary.
There i s considerable weight i n favour of the argument
that the fines should be paid i n part or i n f u l l by those who
were f o o l i s h enough to be caught, and who should therefore pay
more than those who steered clear of the p o l i c e .
Since further subscriptions have now come i n , i t seems
l i k e l y that this amount, together with the p r o f i t from increasing
the price of our Saturday night 'hop', w i l l be enough to cover
the f i n e s as well as the other expenses. Had this not been so,
however, your misguided and i l l - t i m e d e d i t o r i a l would s t i l l have
misled the members of the Union. As 1 have stated above the question
was s t i l l 'sub judice', and had been referred to the appropriate
authority.
F e l i x can play a b i g part i n b u i l d i n g up the s p i r i t of
unity i n the Union. It w i l l not do t h i s , however, by s t i r r i n g up
dissention between the members of the Union and t h e i r elected
o f f i c e r s . Your a r t i c l e may well have given the impression that
certain members of the Union are being harshly treated by a set
of t y r a n n i c a l Union o f f i c e r s .
In wishing F e l i x every success i n the future, I am,
s i r , your obedient servant,
PAUL CUMMING.
President, Imperial College Union.
We f a i l to s ee how our E d i t o r i a l could *Â° described as
misguided or misleading, since the f a c t s It stated are confirmed by
Mr. Cumming's l e t t e r .
We c e r t a i n l y had no i n t e n t i o n of s t i r r i n g up dissention, and
we cannot believe that our readers construed the a r t i c l e i n this
way.
