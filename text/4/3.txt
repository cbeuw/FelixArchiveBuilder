FUTURE OF I . C. HOSTEL.
TROUBLE IN THE HOME.
L a s t term the h o s t e l committee, e l e c t e d from the h o s t e l
r e s i d e n t s , found themselves c o n f r o n t i n g a mass meeting of t h e i r
e l e c t o r a t e who d.emanded to know why they had proposed a new r u l i n g
l i m i t i n g r e s i d e n t s to a maximum of two y e a r s i n the h o s t e l . A c t u a l l y
the r u l i n g was not new; what was new was the d e c i s i o n of t h e
committee to enforce i t .
Arguments came f r o m b o t h s i d e s ; the more a l t r u i s t i c and
highminded (or perhaps they were l e a v i n g t h i s y e a r anyway!) spoke
f o r the enforcement on the l i n e s ' o f f a i r shares f o r the maximum
number. T h e i r opponents - and they were i n the' m a j o r i t y - took the
l i n e t h a t the h o s t e l housed most of those who worked h a r d e s t f o r
U n i o n a f f a i r s , and these people should be encouraged by b e i n g
a l l o w e d t o l i v e i n the h o s t e l . I n a h o s t e l accommodating 100, they

w o u l d be n e g l i g i b l e - a "drop i n the ocean as Mr. Coomber s t y l e d i t .
A f t e r many speakers had argued along t h e s e l i n e s the
committee r e s i g n e d as a body and were promptly r e - e l e c t e d , but
w i t h a w a r n i n g - no Two Y e a r r u l e .
THE GENTLE VETO.
T h i s , b r i e f l y , was the s i t u a t i o n u n t i l t h r e e weeks ago
when the R e c t o r took a hand and a d m i n i s t e r e d what was p r o b a b l y
