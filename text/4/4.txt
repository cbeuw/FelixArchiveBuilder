Then I had a l u c k y b r e a k , and got i n t o u c h w i t h a man #
near here who owns and operates a 44 f o o t f i s h i n g s c h o o n e r . I went
i n t o p a r t n e r s h i p w i t h him on a percentage b a s i s , and have been
f i s h i n g f o r the past two months, u n t i l the season ended a week ago.
They were two of the b e s t months I can remember - i t was
hard work, but I enjoyed b e i n g a f l o a t a g a i n , and I have seen more
c o u n t r y than I had ever hoped. I n those two months I have f i s h e d
salmon o f f A l a s k a , and chased t u n a - f i s h down the P a c i f i c t o M e x i c o .
We s a i l e d out of the S t r a i t of Juan, de Fuca on 1st September
and headed N o r t h f o r salmon. Then we h e a r d t h a t the tuna were coming
i n o f f the C a l i f o r n l a n coa3t, and set h e r head S o u t h . F o r f o u r days
and n i g h t s we s a i l e d S o u t h , k e e p i n g 3 hour watches between u s , out
i n t o the warm b l u e waters of the Japanese C u r r e n t where the t u n a -
f i s h run. about 100 m i l e s o f f s h o r e , u n t i l we got onto the f i s h o f f
the N . C a l i f o r n i a n c o a s t .
I n the f i r s t few days h a u l we put 6 tons of f i s h on b o a r d ,
a l l p u l l e d i n by hand i n 15 t o 40 l b d o l l o p s '
. In the r e a l l y heavy
f i s h i n g i t was n o t h i n g t o see a l l 9 l i n e s l o a d e d at once. Oh boy!
What e x c i t e m e n t ! On the b e s t day we were up at 4.30 a.m. and had
p u l l e d 1"! tons of f i s h on b o a r d by -the time we had b r e a k f a s t at
11.30 a.m.
That was r e a l l y the f i r s t and l a s t f i s h of the tuna season.
F o r the next 5 or 6 weeks we spent our time f i g h t i n g the weather-
c o n t i n u a l g a l e s and near gales' from t h e N o r t h West.
S t i l l t r y i n g t o ' f i s h a t every' o p p o r t u n i t y , we were
s t e a d i l y blown down the l i n e , as we c o u l d o n l y r u n b e f o r e i t when i t
got r e a l l y bad. We put i n at San F r a n c i s c o ( t h r o u g h the Golden G a t e ) ,
Monterey and San Pedro as we were d r i v e n South w i t h each g a l e . Then
we d e c i d e d we s h o u l d have t o head back N o r t h , or we s h o u l d be u n a b l e
t o make i t b e f o r e the w i n t e r weather s e t i n . So back we came,
l i t e r a l l y c l a w i n g our way up the c o a s t , b u c k i n g ' N o r t h Westers a l l
the way. And how', s a f e l y back a f t e r " b u c k i n g " our way up n e a r l y 1000
m i l e s of P a c i f i c Coast, I f e e l I can at l a s t almost c a l l m y s e l f a
