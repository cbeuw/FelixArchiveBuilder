FELIX
Si # • #
H^e have just had the pleasure
of having lunch at Westminster
Technical College. At this College
there is a Catering department,
and the meal was prepared by the
students for their own canteen.
The price, at 2/2d., covered the
cost of food, but not, of course,
the cost of cooking. Their menu
was: —
Thick Vegetable Soup
Lamb Chop
Spagheti, Roast Potatoes,
Mixed Vegetables
Syrup Tart and Custard
Which was hot and delicious.
For a similar meal in Southside
(self service) the cost would have
been about A/6d. i.e. 2/3d. for the
food (as at Westminster) and
2/3d. for the cooking and service
(?)
Much less is spent on service
in a self service canteen than in
other refectories, yet the cost of
meals differs only by a few cop-
pers. Could it be that the amount
which each student pays in South-
side (lower refec.) for his service
is used to subsidise the cost of the
extra service provided by the
waitresses in the other refectories?
If this is not so, we wonder
why, with such a large proportion
of the cost of the meal due to ser-
vice, etc., the standard of Mr.
Mooney's meals is so incredibly
low. It is clearly possible to do
much T>etter.

Political
Bias?
Dear Sir,
We wish to strongly protest at
the misrepresentation of the lun-
cheon of the Association of Scien-
tific Workers at Imperial College.
In their latest hand-out they say
that " the basic reason for the ex-
istence of the Trade Union move-
ment is the continual defence and
improvement of their members'
living standards." In contradiction
they follow this with- a clearly
political motion on Vietnamwhich
has no relevance to the above
statement of function.
Another directly political mo-
tion advocates wholesale na-
tionalisation. In view of their
statement last term that they are
a non-political association we call
upon them to observe their in-
tentions.
Yours faithfully,
J. REMMINGTON

Students
irrational
and intolerant
Dear Sir,
In the course of education one
learns many things, of which ra-
tionality,and tolerance must come
high on the list. It thus disturbed
me to see, and hear, members of
the Union at the E.G.M. last
term, showing complete intoler-
ance of personal views. The
climax of bad manners was
reached when an lewarian got Up
to speak. If such childishly be-
haved speakers continue to utter
forth from the floor of I.C. meet-
ings, I suggest we don't deserve
women at this College.
Yours,
B. MAIR.
