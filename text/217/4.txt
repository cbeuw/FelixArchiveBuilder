Are you prepared to train for
International Management?
We are one of the leading Diesel engine companies
in the world with manufacturing plants in all
hemispheres and with over 120 countries having
Cummins distributors. In the TJ.K. we have links
with both Jaguar and Chrysler and our major
International Offices are based in London. We
are anxious to give full and vigorous training
to a small number of top flight engineering and
arts graduates in order to sustain this expansion
and provide a ready trained nucleus of young men
to accept the future challenges of International
Management. Training will consist of 6/9 months
rotational work spent in all international
departments followed by specific junior management
assignment. Good opportunities exist for
overseas travel and for residence. The company
can confidently offer above average prospects and
rewards for men capable of high achievement.
