R.C.S. UKION.
Who w i l l lead R.C.S. next year?
A f t e r almost a week nobody had been
nominated- however at the 11th hour
MIKE SCOTT of Zoo 3 has been pro-
posed f o r the job. Mike, a respected
member of the Late News s t a f f , w i l l
be a F.G. next year, and aims to
succeed i n promoting s t r e n g t h and
u n i t y w i t h i n R.C.S. On t h i s p l a t -
form he w i l l be a s s i s t e d ( p o s s i b l y )
by KEN WEST„. who i s at pie sent un-
opposed as the V i c e - P r e s i d e n t a l
candidate. I t i s understood that a
1st year chemist has been nominated
f o r the post of P r e s i d e n t ; the Late
News s t a f f wonders whether he has
considered the g r a v i t y of the t a s k
which he i s preparing to undertake,
unless of course i t turns out to be
a hoax. Anyway, we s h a l l have t o
wait u n t i l the hustings on F r i d a y .
