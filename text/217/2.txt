Gateway to Industry
There are several good reasons for buying I.C.,'s Carnival Record
—which is only 7/6. Anyone who has heard the Peter Sellers skit
on American Travelogues will undoubtedly recognise from where
the original idea came, but the I.C. version is every bit as good—in
fact, it almost out-Sellers Sellers!
On the first side we have the four college chants, with the " Hey
Vivo, perhaps the most vigorous. A somewhat falsetto "Kangela"
telis us which college hcs the greatest percentage of women.
If anything lets the record [ companying music is delightful.
The climax in terms of sheer
entertainment value, is definitely
Chris Wright, who talks his own
singing blues composition, self-
accompanied on his autoharp.
This work deserves to reach a far
wider audience than a carnival
record could ever achieve, and
is almost worth 7/6d. on its own.
The content is not all that ex-
cells. In terms of technical quality,
much credit must go to Terry
Morrow, who has made a superb
job of producing this impressive
down, it is the " Minesman's
Drill." The musical backing is
excellent, but the singing is not a
pleasure to listen to. The words,
taken in the context of the remain-
der of the record, are undoubtedly
of questionable taste, which might
tend to lower the whole tone of
the record.
I thought the first side was
good, and. if it was, then the
second side is " n " times better.
It is hard to imagine the (in-
famous " Why was he born,"
being sung so well, and the ac- record. M E L V Y N OWEN

She once wrote an article about smelly
old grannies. In her time, she has defended
vests, aunts and sluts (amongst which
she included herself). Although her style
is quiet she sometimes provokes quite
nice people into writing angry letters.
(Many of them forget to sign their names.)
Read her column in The Observer next
Sunday. You may find you agree with her.
If you don't, please sign your letter. The
unsigned kind go straight into the
waste paper basket.

F O L K SONG CLUB
RECORD DISAPPOINTS
By D. I. WILLIAMS
The second LC. Folk Song Club long-playing record—released
this week—is interesting in the professional appearance of the cover,
but disappointing in the overall lack of clarity in speech on the record.
I think it only fair to compare this disc with the one I was con-
cerned with 12 months ago. It was good to hear backings that were
fuller and stronger, but unfortunate that they tended generally to
drown the voices.
G R E A T ECHO MOUNTAIN BOYS
Their most exciting piece is of their own composition—Greenwood
Rag. This instrumental fairly bursts with life and provides a terrific
opportunity to appreciate the virtues of solo folk instruments. Re-
grettably, their diction tended to be poor, especially Salty Dog Blues.
I was glad to see Derek Hall's Sadie at last recorded for posterity,
but it is a pity that it is marred by the poor timing of his singing.
Geordie is not the type of song that I normally associate with him,
but I was pleasantly surprised by the way he tackled it.
Ivor Grayson-Smith is an up-
and-coming lad and bids fair to
being next year's Folk Club Presi-
dent. But I hope that McColl's
industrial ballads will not set the
pattern for next year's club reper-
toire. His diction remains poor
on The Butcher's Boy, though his
guitar work is delightfully nimble,
but the fluctuations of volume and
tone spoil this track.
The Wayfarers disappointed
me. In spite of the fabulous sound
Christ Wright has created on
autoharp in Barbara Allen, singer
Anu Hay gave a rather uninspired
performance. But this track at
least makes a clean sound, in
strict contrast with the ununited
mush of their follow-up number
—reminiscent of a wax recording
of the 1920's plus bar-balladry
finale.
For the record, a limited edition
of 99 copies have been pressed
and are on sale for just £1 each.
For this money the quality of the
record is all that can be expected.

CHANTALONG
An event definitely not to be
missed in the Carnival calendar is
the Carnival Revue being pre-
sented by members of the I.C.
Dramatic Society on Friday, 14th
May.
This revue features sketches and
material by kind permission of
some of Britain's leading script-
writers (Frank Muir and Dennis
Norden, and Johnny Speight), to-
gether with several musical and
novelty items.
This revue, under the title of
Chantalong, is being produced by
the capable and talented Miss
Brenda Chant, with musical direc-
tion by Mr. Peter Long.
What more can I say?
Surely a must for Carnival
Week.

C A T M E A T A T KING'S
There was a scare at King's
when forty tins of Whiskas were
found in a waste bin near the
Refectory. Despite rumours that
it was part of a plan to make
students stay livelier and live
longer it was later confirmed that
the food came from the Physio-
logy Department, where cats are
kept for use in medical research.
D U R H A M R A G
Several Durham students had
their names taken by the police
whilst trying to suspend two cars
beneath a bridge.
CRIME A T SOTON
A notice to " a fraudulent bas-
tard " has appeared on one of the
Southampton Common Room
notice boards. Two cheques were
stolen from a student and cashed
in London. One was for £20 and
the other for £35. The signa-
tures were forged so well that
the bank had no hesitation in
cashing the cheques.
SHEFFIELD AND T H E PILL
Sheffield, University medical
authorities wjfi prescribe contra-
ceptive pills to couples who can
satisfy the medical officer that
they intend to marry eventually.
(Sheffield has the highest univer-
sity illegitimacy rate—12 babies a
year among 7,000 students.)
AUSSIES CONDEMN
CONSCRIPTION
Sydney students have declared
" unequivocal opposition" to
overseas conscription. They say
that conscripts are being used as
mercenaries, sent into Asia to
support crumbing Dictatorships.
Obviously some are a little yellow
in more ways than one.
P I L L A K B O X CLIMBEVG
Cambridge claims to have
broken the world record for pillar
box climbing. Twenty one stu-
dents succeeded in climbing onto
the largest pillar box in the city
and staying there.
