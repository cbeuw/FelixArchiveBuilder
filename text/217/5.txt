FELI X 5
Guildfinger
by Brian King
The last term is the least active
socially, and yet the most impor-
tant. For this is the term of the
elections. The hustings were held
on May 6th, at the Union Meet-
ings. All the candidates for the
various positions accounted them-
selves well.
However, it is the duty of every
Guildsman and Guildswoman to
register their vote at the election
on Thursday, May 20th. Surely,
an hour, even at this hectic time
of the year, is a small price to pay
for a good Union next year. You
have a vote. Use it, use it well,
and use it wisely.
Countdown
Monday, May 2nd was the date
of theGuilds " take over bid " for
the Countdown Club in Glouces-
ter Road. Only some thirty
couples assisted in the coup, but
all agreed that it was an excellent
evening. It was a pity that more
did not come, for this was an
ideal opportunity to impress the
new bird at the start of the term.
Film
At long last we have all had
the opportunity to see the long
awaited, and much talked about
Guilds Film " Only a Game in a
Guilded Box." The Union should
be grateful to Nick Coope for the
excellent photography (especially
the dream sequences), and to
Dave Bishop for editing the result
and adding the sound track. The
resulting film is something of
which the Union can be proud.
R.C.S. DINNER
The first " Annual R.C.S. Dinner " was held on the first Friday
of term. The choice of Guest Speakers in Professor Levy, who has
retired, and Professor Hills, from Southampton—both ex-staff of
R.C.S.—was commendable.
Professor Levy, after a history of toasts, asked what a Union was.
He said it was a complete abstract—a point which was disputed by a
noisy gentleman on the middle table, who had frequent comment to
make. Professor Levy got as far as say ing the buildings were concrete
(the dinner was held in South Side) and closed his remarks. Apparently
he intended to say more but cut short his Speech " as he could see the
meeting was getting boorish."
The comments were often amusing, but should have been curtailed
during the guests' speeches. For some the comments livened the
dinner up, though others would have preferred a more formal evening,
obviously there's a balance, we can enjoy ourselves without insulting
our guests. In my opinion a boisterous evening was to be expected
and the guests should have been warned. Professor Hills seemed to
expect it and enjoyed it, and his speech was pure amusement.
It all depends on where your bias lies; this is a vague concept de-
pending on the square of the number of sherries knocked back
beforehand. I personally was not embarassed by the audience reaction,
though it was suggested the top table were.
I was more embarassed, some might say guilt-stricken, by the
sermon we had on our attitude to the money we're given (I think that
was it, I was sinking fast by this time). 1 didn't think this was the time
or place—having just spent a pound we were entitled to enjoy our-
selves. Anyway, taken all in all, the evening was a success and should
continue to be so in future years. ^ ^ g y ^ ^ S

GENTLEMEN OF MINES
Professor H . Levy speaking at .he
R.C.S. Dinner
The year is winding to a close
and it is time that I gave an
account of the achievements and
sins of our Union. I am happy
to record that there are no sins
but many achievements. Mines-
men have good reason to hold
their heads on high this year.
We started it comparatively
quietly by coming second in the
boat races, and swimming and
water polo events; but this was
only the beginning. From this
point onwards Mines swept aside
all opposition and carried off all
but one of the available trophies.
The onslaught started with the
Hockey Club winning the Stephen-
son Cup for the first time in 10
years and were rapidly followed
by the Rifle Club who won the
Court Shield for the first time in
28 years. The Soccer Club then
astounded everyone by winning
the I.C. Six-a-side Competition
without conceding a goal. Pride
of place, however, must go to the
Rugby Club who have brought
back four trophies to R.S.M.
They started with strong and con-
vincing wins over R.C.S. and
Guilds to win the Sparkes and
Engineers Cups.
In a more leisurely fashion, the
Rugby Club entertained the Paris
School of Mines for a'weekend,
beating them at rugby and then
taking them to the France-Eng-
land International Match. But
the highlight of the season was
the hard and tense game against
Camborne School of Mines when
R.S.M. triumphed by 9-6 to keep
the " Bottle," where it belongs in
London for the third year in sue
cession.
In the non-sporting fields,
Mines have also shone, tying in
the Debating competition with
Guilds. The Motor Club have
been active keeping Clementine
ever present this year and taking
her twice to Brighton, on Rallies.
The Mines-Guilds Carnival was
a success and the Mines Ball went
to even greater strength.
In December we entertained 11
students from foreign mining
schools at the R.S.M. for 5 days,
climaxing their visit with a splen-
did array of Icwarian girls at the
Mines Ball. The visit was enor-
mously successful and we trust
that it will go from strength to
strength in coming years.
This has been a great year for
the Royal School of Mines union.
Spirit, has been as high as if not
higher, than in previous years and
Minesmen have achieved their vic-
tories as much on spirit and en-
thusiasm as on native ability.
I believe that the spirit will
strengthen and Mines will con-
tinue to lead Imperial College.
We have a unique and special
position in being so small a col-
lege and so successful. Let us
strive to maintain this proud posi-
tion.
