felix loses heavily
In his report delivered on 28th April the Felix Sales Manager
announced that the newspaper loses about £2 per edition through
dishonesty among its subscribers. Apart from money actually being
stolen from the tins—which is infrequent, but did happen on at least
three occasions (in each case involving sums of around £1) .last term
—people are in the habit of taking free copies or under-paying for
their editions.
GATES
During the Easter Vacation,
gates appeared on the two con-
crete stairways from the South
Side Balconies. These gates will
be locked between 11 p.m. and
7 a.m. This is stated to be a
security measure, to prevent entry
to the Halls. The gates will auto-
matically unlock on the ringing of
the fire alarms.
It seems strange that hours be-
tween 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. are not
considered a security risk. Surely
it isjasier to enter rooms without
arousing suspicion during the day
than at night. Also, why aren't
the locks similar to those on the
lift entrance hall doors, which can
be opened by residents' keys.
N.J.W.
Sales figures for the last two
terms show that Civil Engineering
are more often than not among
the dishonest Departments in this
respect, whereas Maths and Aero
r
* -
e consistently honest.
UNION AND SOUTHSIDE
WORST
About half the money lost on
each edition goes from the Union
and Southside, where Felix re-
mains on sale longest, and more
stringent precautions are to be
taken in the future to guard
against this.
Reduced receipts must of neces-
sity lead to a smaller size of Felix,
as we are answerable to a Board
of Dire ;tors for any losses incur-
red dur'ng the year.
Column
The next four days will be your last chance to take any part in
Carnival activities for 1965. So far, we are doing well—our income
to date is just over £1,000—but there are several large bills to be
met including one for a Hillman Imp—the raffle competition prize.
If this Carnival is to be a success we need your support more than
ever in these last four days, when 90 per cent, of the profits are made.
// you haven't already done so, please hand in your raffle tickets to
one of the Carnival stalls before Saturday at the latest.
To-night there are two events—the Southside Stomp, and after
that the Midnight Film Festivalt where the Guns of Navarone and
Waltz of the Toreadors are being shown. Don't worry if you haven't
got a ticket for the Southside Stomp—they are on sale at the door.
To-morrow evening is the Folk Song Club's night, with a
Hootenany held in the Concert Hall, including Tom Paxton among
the guest singers, and on Friday, there is the Revue.
Saturday is of course, the big Tickets for all these events are
day of the week. It starts on on sale at the Carnival Stalls,
Friday evening with groups of
magazine sellers camping out
along the route of the procession
—which does not go along Old
Church Street, as shown in the
magazine, but the next street west.
At 12 o'clock Saturday, the pro-
cession leaves Imperial Institute
Road and will take between an
hour-and-a-half and two hours to
get round the whole route.
At 2.30, the fete starts—we still
need -stalls, so go to the Carnival
Office if you want to help. At
about 4.00 the Carnival Queen
will draw the raffle winners, and
the contents of the whisky bot-
tle full of sixpences will be an-
nounced.
In the evening is the Grand
Finale, when 1,500 people will
crowd into the Union to dance
and drink till midnight —the
official end of Carnival 1965.
where you can also buy Carnival
Records, and, if by any chance,
you haven't got an " Etc.", you
can get that too.
If you want to help with general
collecting throughout these four
days, see Bruce Copper, or your
year rep.
We hope that you will support
these last events, and make this
year's Carnival an even greater
success than last years.

REGGIE
Kings appear to have lost all
interest in their Lion, for they
have failed to solve half of the
thirteen clues. Why not call it
quits, admit I.C. are too good for
Kings, tell them to sell 200 books
of raffle tickets and let them have
their blasted lion back.
