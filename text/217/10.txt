10 FELIX
Sports Day
Little ToAttract
Sports Day was held on Wed-
nesday, 5th May, at Hurlingham
Park. After a non-existent Na-
tional Anthem, the proceedings
v/ere started by " the man in the
red hat" (to quote Mr. Jenkins).
There were no outstanding per-
formances, although the general
standard of performance was
quite high. Bishop of C&G, com-
pleted the treble during the after-
noon by adding victories in the 1
mile and the steeple-chase to his
win in th^ three miles last term.
C & G seemed to have a slight
advantage over R.C.S. on the
track, but R.S.M. did very well in
the field events, notably the Pole
Vault and Javelin. The match was
very close the whole way, the final
result depending upon the last
Tug-of-War between C & G and
R.S.M. In spite of combined
R.C.S. and Mines vocal support
in the latter, C & G won the event,
and apparently the competition.
Lady Jackson, wife of Sir Willis
Jackson, head jof the Electrical
Engineering Department, pre-
sented the cups ably assisted by
Norman Price.
Final Result :
1st City and Guilds College 138 pts,
2nd Royal College of Science 137 pts.
3rd Royal School of Mines 88 pts.

Diving club
enjoys warmer
water
In past years, the club has held
Easter training dives in Great
Britain, inevitably, bad weather
and poor diving conditions have
meant that very little time was
spent diving and only a maso-
tihist could regard it as a pleasure.
Last term the club committee de-
cided that this Easter's dive
should be held in the Mediter-
ranean.
Despite fears that the new com-
pressor, 1irst promised for delivery
last August, might not arrive in
time, a party of twelve set out in
the club van on April 8th. Two
private cars also went on the
trip, each taking three people.
Four of the party were members
of Cambridge University who
travelled on an exchange basis, to
the diving site at L a Ciotat, mid-
way between Marseilles and Tou-
lon.
The club had hoped to use the
van to travel to nearby diving sites
but, almost on arrival, a crack in
the cylinder-head Opened up and
a replacement had to be flown
from England. Sincere thanks are
due to Mr. F. G. Irving who
towed the equipment trailer to
diving sites with his Rover and
also collected the new cylinder
head from Marseille airport.

The actual diving was superb.
Even on the windiest days, under-
water visibility was between 30
and SO feet This is much better
than the best conditions in British
waters. The water was atso ten to
fifteen degrees Fahrenheit warmer
than in Wales at Easter. A very
good site was found at Cassis ten
kilometres along the coast. The
diver could step straight off dry
land into thirty feet of water. In
places there were fifty foot under-
water cliffs honeycombed with
small caves and teeming with life.
In nine days at La Ciotat, most
people had eight dives of up to
half an hour. It had been hoped
to do more than this but lack of
transport caused some time to be
lost. A lot of colour slides were
taken and also some underwater
cine film. It is intended to show
the films at a meeting open to the
whole college in the near future.
All those who went consider
that the trip was well worthwhile
at a cost of only twenty pounds.
A similar trip is being planned
for next Easter. R > L > yraef..
IN T O U C H
Kearns Achieves Results
A little storm broke last Wednesday over the normally friendly
but ill-supported College Sports Day.
This year, the competition between the Constituent Colleges was
a very close-run thing and after several recounts C & G beat RCS by
1 point. However, the result of the cross-country race (held at the U.L.
Champs, in the Autumn Term) has during the past been included in
the Sports Day results, and would this year have given RCS victory
by 3 points. But Mr. Kearns, President of Mines has been responsible
for a few sparks flying at this " College event," which normally passes
unnoticed outside the Athletic Club.
After gate-crashing a meeting and getting no satisfaction (R.S.M.
weren't informed in sufficient time of the X-country) this industrious
gentleman then " cons " Sadhvani into an appeal to the Sports Day
referee to delete the X-country result from the day's events. The
referee (Mr. Cutcliffe) concurs and thus Kish has thrown away a cup
(he probably doesn't give two hoots about it anyway) but those poor
devils who've pulled their guts out running up Parliament Hill for the
glory of R.C.S., obviously take exception to all this underhand politics.
Kearns, really hadn't a leg to stand on, R.S.M. didn't even have
an Athletics Captain at the time of the X-country, and surely the
captains of the constituent athletic clubs should have been invited to
see Mr. Cutcliffe.
Still, this little affair can't do any harm and besides being a giggle
may even help to bring reality to the pretence that Sports Day is a
major College event.
Hockey
By E. Needham
The Imperial College Hockey
team entertained the Forward
Hockey Club of Gronigen, Hol-
land during Easter week. The
week consisted mainly of enter-
tainment with a dinner on the
Tuesday evening and celebrations
continuing until the early hours.
Also l.C. played and beat the
Dutch ieam in a game at Harling-
ton.
However, both teams spent the
Easter weekend at the hockey
festival at Lowestoft. Socially, of
course, a successâ€”the Royal
Hotel treated the teams as resi-
dents, and are still regretting it.
Forward played 6 games and
won one. I.C. played 5 and won
two. Outstanding in the I.C. vic-
tories were the forwards Hough,
Stenning and McKenzie. Out-
standing in the defence was Sten-
ning, who seemed to suffer from a
drastic loss of stamina. Naturally;
the defence of Needham, Phillips,
Peters and Castell remained firm
and an inspiration to the rest of
the team. The fact that I.C. drew
the last two games surely indicates
the part these four have played
in the team during the whole
season.
Thus, although the results were
not particularly nattering, this
trip was indeed an excellent finish
to a wonderful season for the
Hockey Club.
Water Polo
Staple/ Picked
for B.U.S.F.
By S. H. Rowe
The term ended with a strong
flavour of success for I.C. Water-
Polo team. I.C. was selected to
form the nucleus of a London
University " B " team at the
British Universities Champion-
ships at Crystal Palace. The " B "
team succeeded in crushing the
highly rated combined C.A.T.'s
of Great Britain and also scored
two victories against the combined
Irish Universities and the Welsh
Universities. It was unfortunate
that the London " B " team did
not rank officially in the competi-
tion as they were clearly the only
suitable opposition, apart fron
U.A.U., to the London " A " team
which won the competition. The
highlight of the B.U.S.F. meeting
for I.C. was the selection of
Stapley to represent the British
Universities against the German
Universities. We wish him luck
for the England under 21 trial
later this year.
I.C.'s next battle ground is
down in the West Country where
they have tour matches against
Fowey, R.N. Manadon, R.N.
Dartmouth, Torquay and Ilfra-
combe.
