I.C.WA Lose Trophy
College Athletics in
Sorry State
By Frank Hobson
Helen launched a thousand
ships but she must have known a
trick or two that I.C.'s combined
beauty didn't because despite "at-
tractive " efforts by Misses Cur-
tis, Youle, Hay, and others,
I.C.W.A. lost possession of the
U.L. Women's Athletics Cham-
pionship to Chelsea C.S.& T. at
Motspur Park on May 1st. No
longer, it seems can the women's
cups be won simply by fielding a
full team.
Hall Wins High Jump
In the men's events the I.C.
team wasn't even a shadow of its
old self.
The only successes were in the
High Jump where I.C. filled 1st
and 2nd places, Leon Hall reap-
ing the benefits of a dedicated
winter's training by winning him-
self the championship and a trip
to Paris with the U.L. team; and,
of all events, the two mile walk.
Here at last I.C. have two people
who take the event seriously and
gained 2nd and 3rd places.
"Fings ain't what
they used to be»»
Apart from the walk, the Col-
lege gained no points at all in the
track events—a far cry from the
days when the track section of the
U.L. team was almost an I.C.
club. Otherwise, highlights of the
meeting were an exciting 3 miles
won in 14m. 9.4 s. by Nick Barton
(Kings) from Pete Ya'es (U.C.),
a cross country internailonal, and
the 440 yds. won in a fast 49.8s.
by N . Palmer an England Schools
champion.

As the last car arrived at the
R.V. in Gloucester, the situation
was not quite as expected;
ffagins were only twelve and
theirfixturehad been changed to
" Stow-on-the-Wold," 26 miles
away.
The eventual kick-off was 4.30
p.m. (1 hour late) with 16 men a
side on a sloping pitch In a farm.
The many spectators witnessed a
weak start by ffagins, and a half
time score of 15—0 against.
However ffagins' will to win came
too late, the final result being
23—12 against.
As ffagins left the field to return
to the " Unicorn" they noticed
a large barn. The entertainment
was good; at eleven,ffaginsfound
themselves sitting in the rather
comfortable lounge of the Unicorn
Inn, thinking that no digs had
been arranged, but they would
sleep in the changing-rooms. It
was up to one of the brighter and
hardier members to suggest the
barn.
Lousy Night
Sleep was interrupted abruptly
at seven the next morning, by
the milking of cows. Alas, the
recumbent figures were discovered
when the farmworker, Meadows,
came for a bale of straw. Dressed
in rags, casually chewing a piece
of straw, he skewered a handy
bale with a two-pronged fork.
John Hall narrowly escaped in-
jury as those two long prongs
entered the bale adjacent to his
sleeping position in a pile of loose
straw.
Although Meadows had obvi-
ously noticed most offfagins(he
had stared Tony Phillips in the
eyes) he had not batted an eyelid.
It was only when greeted " Morn-
ing " did he reply, " Mornin,'
rats bite, boy?" as he slung the
bale over his shoulder and walked
off.
Many Injuries
The next three days were
equally action packed. However,
it will suffice to say that by Mon-
day, when ffagins were due to
play Weston United before an
appreciable crowd, five men had
been injured either on or off the
field. Pete Dunn and Tony
Phillips had beaten lips, sustained
when they had been dragged from
their car and " roughed-up " in
Cheltenham. It is interesting to
note that in this same incident,
Hall had been thrown to the
ground and was kicked several
times in the ribs, but not hurt.
Richardson had seen the disad-
vantage in numbers and run away.
The position at Weston was
desperate; ffagins had lost three
fixtures played, and were due to
play a higher team than Merthyr
Cross Country

Hurlingham, March 24th
1st A . Bishop (C&G) 15m. 37s.
2nd H . Dickson (C&G)
15m. 55s.
3rd D. Reaves (C&G) 16m, l i s .
Team Results: 1, Guilds—38 pts.
2, R.C.S.—40 pts. 3, Mines—
93 pts.
The individual race was expec-
ted to be a close tussle between
Howard Dickson and Tony
Bishop, but Dickson failed to pro-
duce his best form and Bishop won
the race with an ease reflected in
the slow time. This was a deserved
and popular success as Bishop,
this year's captain, has worked
hard to produce a reasonable col-
lege team out of the limited talent
available.
R.C.S., who were without their
three fastest men, did well to get
within two points of Guilds' win-
ning total. All credit to Mines for
finishing a team.
Although the College 1st team
has hit a lean spell, the club is
still flourishing as was shown by
the good attendance at the
A.G.M. and those elected were—
President: Dave Penfold (Phys.)
Captain: Howard Dickson (Elec.
Eng.)
V. Captain: Alan Cope (Chem.)
Secretary: Alan Walker (Phys.)
Treasurer: Dave Holmes (Phys.)
Congratulations must go to
Dave Bonham (Phys.) who was
awarded the Petersham Pot for
the most consistent member of
the club.

Tydfil. The reason ior this blun-
der was that the Weston Com-
mittee thought that ffagins was a
team from St. Ffagins in South
Wales, who were surely a powerful
team. This matter was put right
when the Captain of Ffagins was
introduced to the Chairman of the
Committee. It was explained that
ffagins were from London, to
which the Chairman replied
" Where's that?" anyway a Com-
mittee Meeting has to be held in
order to reverse the fixtures, the
result of which was never dis-
closed.
Richards To
The rescue
Meanwhile, Tony Richards had
arrived and though ill, had
brought a large friend. The
other places were filled by mem-
bers of Weston's rival club, Hor-
nets. The game was exciting and
enjoyable. For some reason the
crowd were unbelievably biased
towards ffagins and with theii
tremendous encouragement, the
visitors won 11-3. Although
victory would have been impos-
sible without the Hornets, the
players who were outstanding in
this game, were pure blooded
ffagins.
