Felix FELIX, Wednesday March 18th 1987 6
Christine's
The letter from a group of civil
engineering postgraduates (FELIX
11/3) seems to have caused
widespread consternation around the
College. It is most ironic that it was
printed when it was. Last Friday the
Governing Body of Imperial College
approved a plan to offset a large
projected budget deficit. As well as
increasing revenue from research
contracts, the aim is to 'lose' one
hundred staff and to recruit one
hundred extra overseas students over
the next year. Some of the one
hundred staff will be academics
transferred onto research grants but
the majority it seems will be real job
losses from academic, technical and
non-technical staff. Since the
academics hold the balance of power
at College it is not difficult to imagine
where most of the job losses will
actually come from. It's worth noting
that there is nobody on Governing
Body to represent the non-academic
staff; it seems to fall to the Students'
Union and those external governors
with Trade Union sympathies to
attempt to put forward their
viewpoints.
As for recruiting a hundred extra
overseas students, it would be
ludicrous to pretend that this extra
Bits
increase in numbers (regardless of
nationality) is not going to put
considerable strain on central,
departmental and accommodation
facilities.
The plan approved by the
Governors may be felt to be essential,
but its effects are likely to be
damaging; fewer "teachers", even
more emphasis on research; less
technical support; more
overcrowding; even worse
accommodation shortage. Sad day
indeed.
Was it Worth it?
In today's financial climate it is
inevitable that students (especially
from overseas) are seen more and
more as Income to the College.
Recruitment has to be done, but there
should at least be some honest about
the situation.
How many students here feel they
were misled by IC's recruitment
drive? Most of the recruitment
literature I have seen is pretty honest
about things like accommodation but
how true a picture it paints of the
academic life in departments it is hard
to say. (Incidentally this is why the
Union's Alternative Prospectus is so
necessary) I can only hope that the
complaints outlined in the letter in the
last FELIX are not too widespread.
As for those particular complaints,
they have not gone unnoticed by the
College, but if some of the students
concerned would contact me (int
3501) or Gareth Fish, the Union's PG
Academic Affairs Officer (via Union
Office) we will follow up your
specific problems as far as possible.
This applies to any other postgrads
with academic grievances.
Alternatively you could contact your
department's PG tutor—who is
supposed to deal with problems like
this.
Information and Publicity
It seems I owe everybody an
apology for my part in failing to
publicise the big NUS march a few
weeks back. This was not due to any
wish to keep Imperial as insular as
possible. As the NUS send IC Union
no information we (ie, Union
Officers) learn about such matters in
much the same way as anybody else.
It is most unfortunate that none of us
who were vaguely aware of the event
remembered to put it in FELIX.
There does seem to be a separate
information problem here, though.
Take the ULU 50% cuts situation for
example. If we can have 4000 leaflets
distributed in FELIX, several articles
in FELIX including a front page
headline, two UGM motions, a guest
speaker and a poster campaign—and
still be told that the Union had not told
the students anything about it (letters,
FELIX 6/3) then I wonder where the
problem really lies. Unfortunately
four sabbaticals can't be omnipresent
to tell everyone about everything in
person. After the sabbaticals and
staff, a students' union is only as good
as the students who get involved in
it, after all. Constructive suggestions
and practical help are more than
welcome from anyone who thinks we
should be doing better.
Norman's Lives On
The good news is that the Union
Snack Bar will be open as usual
during the day time over Easter. So
anyone who's still around can get real
food, real coffee, etc, etc, at probably
the cheapest prices in London—
without those awful term-time
queues. Ground Floor, Union
Building, Beit Quad—for anyone
who's not discovered it yet.
Finally
A request for volunteers
(particularly women) to work for the
Women's National Cancer Control
Campaign. WNCCC produces
information about cervical and breast
cancer detection and organises seven
mobile screening clinics. They are
flexible about hours and are based
near College, off Park Lane—so if
anyone can spare them a few hours
a week, let me know and I'll give you
further details.
That's all for now, have a good
Easter break...
Love Christine.
Opinion; Bedtime for Democracy?
M a r k C o t t l e
Having been severely disillusioned by
the recent fiasco of a Presidential
election I am convinced that the
Union Constitution needs re-
examining. It is apparent from student
reaction to Union General Meetings
that the Union is failing to attract the
interest of its members to important
matters which may affect their
facilities, welfare and rights. In this
situation it is clearly possible that the
Union could eventually end up being
run by anyone who cares to be pushy
enough, with no regard for anyone
who disagrees with them.
The most important part of the
Union in terms of whether it serves
its members or tries to make them
serve it, is the Executive. A poor
Executive will impose its own
opinions rather than represent other
people's. Last year's President and
DP were severely censured for this
attitude, but little could be done to
actually make them take any notice.
We can either pray for saintly people
to be elected or look at the whole
Constitution to find ways in which the
flow of opinion from students to their
representatives can be made more
effective.
One obvious thing to do is make
sure you are electing the right people.
It is unfortunate that all electors in
College-wide elections have to judge
candidates on the information
produced by those candidates. There
are UGM speeches and questions but
these are very limited. I would like
to see some way for candidates to be
personally challenged. At least in
national elections we can see
politicians being grilled by
interviewers. Of course there are
problems of media bias. There is also
a good case for restricting questions
to keep out spiteful personal attacks.
But the electorate has a right to
challenge those who seek to lead it.
I find it very worrying when I
encounter people who try to clamp
down on freedom to speak out and
question as happened at the beginning
of the Hustings UGM.
My second point about elections
concerns the role of the returning
officer and the election committee in
interpreting the election rules. This
year Dave Colley has been zealous in
his enforcement of the rules.
Unfortunately he has also been rather
erratic in his interpretation of those
rules and has occasionally come close
to allowing his own personal opinion
to override them. It has always
seemed to me that if something is not
specifically and explicitly laid down
in such rules then it is not up to one
person to decide "the spirit of the
rules" and effectively decide a new
one. I realise Dave was trying to be
fair in his own mind but I still find
his action disturbing.
Finally on a more positive note I
want to suggest that the representation
system in the Union is overhauled.
Most people do not want to have to
sit through long and boring meetings
just to take an interest in one or two
points. Therefore I suggest we come
up with some way to cut down the
amount of bickering on political
issues that occurs at UGMs. If there
was an alternative forum for debate
of all types to which interested parties
could go, then only more meaningful
business could be sent on to a UGM.
This would cut out irrelevant motions
such as those concerning national
political issues un-related to students
and joke motions. I hope the Union
Planning Group might consider ideas
along these lines with particular
attention to the future role of Council
and the Exec.
Additionally, I don't think the
system of elected reps of all sorts is
necessarily the best way of gathering
the views of students generally. I
would like to see a better use of
surveys and referendums to try to get
a response from people who would
not normally attend committees. This
year's survey which I helped produce
has shown that it is possible to get an
extremely useful response in such a
manner. The survey inevitably had its
flaws which are now revealed, I hope
whoever is around next year will learn
from this experience. Ultimately if
student unions won't try to be
experimental models for new
democracy what hope is there
elsewhere?
