• It seems that naughty FELIX has been misleading you again
with a few inaccuracies. Not only will the overall winner be
picked on Saturday 9th May but we won't be publishing any
of the answers until after that date. All the questions will be
repeated again in FELIX (May 8th issue) and all answers must
be in by 5.30pm that Friday. If you choose to answer the
quetions each week and get the answers in by the following
Wednesday your name will be placed into a weekly draw of
entrants with a prize of a £10 travel voucher.
• The first winner of the draw was Mark Ball of Chemistry
3 who correctly answered both questions.
• All entries should be addressed to the FELIX Office, and must
be marked "STA Competition". For further information contact
either FELIX or Mark Fletcher, in the STA Office on level 2
of the Sherfield building.
Answers to the FELIX Office by 1.30pm on Monday April 27th.
