AIDS results
IC Union has instructed the Executive
to oppose discrimination against
AIDS sufferers and HIV carriers. A
motion passed at the Results UGM re-
quires the Exec to allow any AIDS pa-
tient or carrier equal access to Union
and College facilities. In addition, the
Exec will be writing to the College
authorities and the Health Centre, re-
questing statements on the official
position*on the AIDS issue.
Most sections of the motion, pro-
posed by Robert Daniel, were pass-
ed without opposition. There was
some discussion on the sections
relating to policy on access to spor-
ting facilities. Guilds President-elect
Dave Tyler pointed out that the Rugby
Football Union had banned carriers
from taking part in that sport. An
amendment, proposed by Guy Perry,
limited the 'equal access' policy to
those sports where the ruling body
had not issued a directive to the con-
trary, and this section was passed in
this form. The only section of the mo-
tion not to be carried denied the right
of employers to demand that any per-
son take an HIV test. This section was
defeated on the vote. Quorum was
then called.
Rerun
The election for ICU President will
have to be rerun. Bill Goodwin, the
only candidate standing for the post
following the sudden withdrawal of
Ian Howgate, decided not to appeal
against Election Committee's decision
to invalidate the election. ICU Hon
Sec Dave Colley gave a report in his
capacity as Returning Officer at last
Thursday's results UGM. He explain-
ed that he had permitted Messrs
Goodwin and Howgate to use their
'joint' posters when they had been
presented to him already printed. His
original decision had been not to
allow them. When the matter was
discussed at Elections Committee it
was decided to follow the written
rules as clearly as possible and Mr
Colley's ruling was overturned.
Next year's non-sabbatical Union
Officers were also elected at the
Results UGM. As none of the elec-
tions were contested, each of the
following were returned unopposed:
Adrian Johnson (Internal Services Of-
ficer), John Noble (Entertainmments
Officer), Alistair Seymour (UGM
Chairman), Lindsey Wishart
(Women's Officer), Neil Motteram
(External Affairs Officer), Pippa
Salmon (Welfare Officer) and Nigel
Baker (Rag Chairman).
Zeebrugge
Members of the Chem Eng
department organised a raffle and
cake sale for the Zeebrugge ferry
disaster appeal last Monday. The
event took place on the JCR and
Chem Eng Concourse and raised over
£500. The organisers would like to
thank everyone who supported the
event. Any donations can be made
through the Nat West Bank who will
provide a special credit slip for the
purpose.
Not boring
The last of the Constituent College
Union elections took place yesterday
in Mines G20. A well-attended Mines
UGM listened to speeches from can-
didates for the posts of President,
Vice President, Honorary Secretary
and Foreign Students' Officer.
The election drew College-wide in-
terest due to the candidature of Jane
Spiegel (Geology) and British high
jumper Geoff Parsons (Min Tech) for
the post of President.
The final result was Geoff Parsons
(President), Paddy Coleman (VP),
Chris Davies (Hon Sec) and John
Riding (Foreign Students' Officer).
Conman
again
The conman who has stolen hundreds
of pounds from IC students was near-
ly caught by police last Friday. The
man approached a Chinese student
who realised his real identity and at-
tempted to set a trap. On being asked
for £1000 the student said that he had
no money with him, but arranged to
meet the man at 5pm in front of the
Royal School of Mines. He then
alerted the police who rushed to the
scene, but arrived a few minutes too
late to apprehend the man. Police are
now trying to trace the owner of the
car, a Fiat Uno, which the man was
driving.
The conman is still using the same
story to get foreign students to part
with money. He claims to be a French
airline steward and always asks for a
substantial sum, offering a fake gold
watch as surety. Anyone who is ap-
proached by this man should contact
College security immediately on
3370.
Pot-bellied
Monday's IC Union Council meeting
voted to 'award' a flower pot to the
holder of the post of Haldane Library
Record Buyer, currently held by
Adrian 'Jelly' Johnson, The motion,
proposed by Pete Wilson and Mr.
Johnson, originally sought to award
a pot for the Record Buyer to sit
behind the Union Bar, but was
amended by Alan Pose to the final
form. Mr. Wilson accepted this
amendment, and Mr. Johnson, being
absent, could not do a lot about it.
Tortured
Between 9.00am last Thursday and
9.00am the following Friday, most of
IC Amnesty Group interned itself in
a 'camp' in the JCR, on a diet of
bread, water and IC Radio. This was
done in aid of prisoners of conscience
throughout the world, with particular
emphasis on Ivan Starovoit, IC
Union's adopted prisoner.
Not at all boring
A student from St Mary's was elected
sabbatical President of the University
of London Union (ULU) at the annual
meeting of U L U General Union
Council (GUC) last Saturday. John
Tilsead, current Societies Council
Chair at U L U , beat Dermot
D'Riorden, also a medical school
candidate, by 54 votes to 33 at the
Council which has delegates from all
the colleges in the University of
London.
The two other sabbaticals were also
elected at the meeting. Peter
Robertson, current GUC Chair, was
returned unopposed as Vice President
(Finance & Administration) and
Lachie Stewart (UCL sabbatical) beat
Susan Moyse (SSEES) for the Vice
President (Services) post.
All the candidates promised to try
and increase involvement in ULU, but
said that it would not be easy. They
pledged to keep the 3Rs campaign
against the 50% cuts in ULU, and Mr
Stewart promised that ULU would
a more campaigning
become
organisation.
ICU President Christine Taig said
she was disappointed at the number
of IC delegates that turned up. Only
three official delegates and three
stand-ins actually attended, out of a
usual delegation size of nine. This
was after all the sabbatical candidates
had attended a hustings at IC
especially for these delegates to ask
questions.
