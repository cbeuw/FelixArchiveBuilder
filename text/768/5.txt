Felix FELIX, Wednesday March 18th 1987
Obituary
J o s e M o l i n a
On Monday the 9th of March Jose
Molina, a Mexican PhD student in the
Department of Mathematics, suffered
a fatal accident at approximately
1.30pm when riding back home from
Imperial. His death has deeply
saddened his close friends and the
whole community at Imperial
College, especially the Latin
American community, the Choir and
Chamber Music societies and the
Overseas Student Committee. Jose
was a very bright and active student,
with an endearing personality,-
extremely friendly and was greatly
involved in many activities at IC.
Jose read Physics at Universidad
Automnoma Metropolitana in Mexico
City. He joined IC Physics
Department in October 1981 to do a
one-year MSc course in Applied
Optics. During this course he showed
a great potential to undertake
research. He started his PhD in
October 1983 under the supervision
of Dr John Elgin and was, at the
present moment, in the writing up
stage prior to undertaking
postdoctoral studies. Besides being a
very capable student (he had already
published four papers and given some
seminars at Cambridge), Jose had
great musical talent and organising
skills. He was the Chairman of the
Choir society from October 1985 to
1986 and the treasurer of the Overseas
Students Committee for three years,
and still had the energy to perform a
guitar concert with the Chamber
Music society on the 2nd of March.
Restless and unstoppable he was
always ready to help and offer the best
of himself to everybody. We have no
doubt that with this great charm,
intelligence and energy Jose would
have achieved great things in his life.
He will be greatly missed by us all.
May he rest in peace.

"The usefulness of an engineer
is proportional to the square of
the number of people he knows"
Sir Harold Harding
Cynical at first glance, but don't get us wrong. A
nod, a wink and a funny handshake won't get even
an O C onto the Board of Directors. That isn't what
we are about. However, look at it this way. If you
try to learn everything for yourself from scratch you
will never learn enough. Much better to have
access to other people's knowledge so you can
take short-cuts.
Who was Sir Harold Harding? Well if you don't ask,
you'll never find out.
