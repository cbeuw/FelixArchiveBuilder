Not Jelly-roll
Morton
Dear Dave,
All pop and other non-classical
recordings in the Haldane Library are
bought by an annually-elected Student
Record Buyer out of Union funds, and
not. as many users believe, by the
Library. This session students have
every right to complain about the lack
of new recordings since this year's
Student Record Buyer. Adrian
Johnson (Aero II). has failed almost
totally to carry out the job for which
he was elected, in spite of efforts by
us and Union officers to get him to
do so. He has bought only 33
recordings so far compared to the
normal average at this time of year
of about 150. and he has ignored our
requests to get on with the job. He has
also taken away request cards and
kept them so that we have no idea
who has asked for what. To those of
your readers who are rightly
complaining to us (and blaming us for
what Johnson has failed to do), I have
to say that the Library can do
nothing—it is the Union to which he
is answerable.
Why should Johnson be permitted
to get away with behaviour which so
insults the Union and those of its
members who elected him? And why
should your readers have to wait until
next year (when many will have left)
for their requests to be satisfied? I am
not aware that Union record funds can
be carried over from one session to
another, so money not spent this
session will presumably be totally
lost.
Yours sincerely,
Richard G. Williams,
Haldane Librarian.
Voice of the
Union?
Dear Dave,
During my time here at Imperial
College of Science and Technology
I have been led to believe that the
Union is a non-political body
concerned with the non-academic side
of student life, as well as student
welfare; FELIX, being the voice of
the Union should, presumably, reflect
this.
Accordingly, I was very surprised
to find that the article about the
address by Tony Benn should merit
a front page position, whilst a talk by
Sir Clive Sinclair (a true pioneer in
the fields of Computing and Electrical
Engineering) to over 300 students, did
not even receive a mention.
I trust that this omission was merely
an oversight by the Editor and not an
attempt to bias our political judgement
(talks by Sir Geoffrey Howe and Cecil
Parkinson also did not receive a
mention).
Yours sincerely,
Michael van Messel, Phvsics III.
Voicing
Objections
Dear Dave,
Once again sabbatical elections are
upon us, and once again interest in
ICU is at such an unprecedented level
that there are less candidates than ever
for the four posts and the Hustings
UGM was numerically inquorate
(despite some creative accounting).
However, the STV system of
proportional representation allows for
the populace to register its
dissatisfaction with candidates by
abstention so that where the
abstention vote outnumbers the total
votes for all candidates, the election
must be re-run from scratch with new
candidates being allowed to take part.
But lo! We already have one
candidate 'elected' unopposed. Was
the populace allowed to register their
dissatisfaction here and require a re-
run? (No comment is intended here
about the actual candidate concerned;
the same situation has arisen almost
every year I've been here and has
always seemed equally iniquitous).
No vote is taken on single candidates,
and yet the method by which
candidates can essentially be rejected
works just as well whether there are
one or more running for a post. Why
aren't we allowed to make our voice
heard just because apathy was so rife
that someone had no opposition?
Yours sincerely,
JA Fagandini, EE IV.
NATO
offensive
Dear Dave,
I read the article on collective
defence by David Burns in last week's
FELIX. There were some major
inaccuracies in what he reported.
When Tony Benn spoke at Imperial
about two weeks ago he did indeed
advocate the withdrawal from NATO
but he stated that his views on defence
differed from those of the majority of
the Labour Party in that he wanted a
strong nuclear deterrent outside
NATO. The 'opinion' by David
Burns implies that Mr Benn wanted
no nuclear deterrent. I think most
people in Britain would clearly argue
that if there is a nuclear armoury on
this soil then it should be controlled
totally by this Government. It is the
opinion of most of the people with
whom I have discussed this that at
present this is not the case. It seems
to me that this is what Mr Benn
wanted. The article then goes on to
imply that only the Soviets train their
forces 'in a highly'offensive role' but
in Eastern Africa (Kenya) the Marines
are trained in offensive roles to attack
the Soviet forces in Ethiopia and they
maintain unnecessarily large bases in
Mombasa and Malindi. Mr David
Burns needs to research his articles
more clearly in future so as to avoid
giving his readers a biased inaccurate
view.
Yours sincerely,
W Murambu.
Counsel for
the defence
Dear Dave,
I am sorry that Mr Murambu finds
my research inadequate. As far as I
know Tony Benn MP has of recent
years stood on an entirely non-nuclear
platform and I am amazed that anyone
should suggest otherwise. As for
Kenyan Marines in Ethiopia, after
extensive additional research, I am
unable to find a single reference to
Kenya ever having been a member of
the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, and it was NATO to
which my article was devoted.

Second
thoughts
Dear FELIX,
Reading Mr R.Brown's letter in
FELIX 6/3/87, one is left with the
impression that he is guilty of the
narrow-mindedness of which he
accuses the respondents to his original
letter. He seems to assume that since
the respondents do not agree with him
they have not "listened with open
hearts." I'm sure if they re-read it
carefully a thousand times over they
would still come to the same
conclusion, as would Mr Brown.
What's the big deal in having "friends
who are or have been prostitutes,
heroin addicts, alcoholics or
tramps"—a friend is a friend is a
friend.
Yours sincerely,
Vijay Kumar
Another man
speaks
Dear Dave,
One can't help feeling that Clare
Murphy's concern (FELIX March
~6th) for the rights of women is a bit
misdirected.
I would think that there are few
people on either side of the argument
over abortion who would fail to have
compassion for the woman who finds
she has conceived a child and faces
the prospect of nine months
pregnancy and of birth with dread.
If indeed, then, the solution is to
allow the woman to "choose what is
going to happen to her body" should
we not, before pushing this too
strongly, allow and encourage her to
know what the facts relevant to this
choice are? That the foetus, as shown
for instance by the technique of In
Vitro Fertilization (as well as medical
evidence and human experience) is
not her own body but that of another
individual; that the abortion operation
is not as simple as having an appendix
out—perhaps films of what actually
happens to the woman's body and the
foetus should be shown more widely,
in the cause of women's rights; that
many, probably the majority, of
women who have had abortions suffer
great mental traumas (Post Abortion
Syndrome—see the current issue of
The Spectator).
But perhaps more importantly, it
does appear that Ms Murphy's advice
(along with many others) belies a
rather dangerously cavalier attitude
towards sexuality and the creation of
life. Is it really helpful to advocate
abortion as a long-stop to
'contraception failure," suggest
wilful conception as "wrecking good
prospects" of being a "baby
machine" and, indeed, derogate a
father attempting to care for and take
responsibility for his and his partner's
child as dastardly "daring"? Does all
this not, thus, dicourage the woman
from regarding her womb as it is, an
inherent and positive part of her
sexuality through which new life is
carefully and magnificently fostered,
but rather encourage it to be seen,
almost, as just a dustbin of desire?
Does this advice not, indeed,
discourage us from regarding this new
life as the good and valuable thing
each of us knows it is, but rather
encourage the woman and society
(and the father of course please) to
regard it as a silly disease?
It is perhaps no wonder to find,
where such attitudes are prevalent,
distraught and confused unexpectedly
pregnant women; so distraught and
confused as to go through with an
abortion.
Yours sincerely,
Hugh MacKenzie, Civ Eng RA
