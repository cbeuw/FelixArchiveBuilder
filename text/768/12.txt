Rowing, Saturday March 7th; Reading Head
IC beat Oxford
Rowing success
Imperial College beat Oxford's
Boatrace crew. But Imperial's
extraordinary coach Bill Mason was
far from happy. Make no mistake,
however, Imperial has now proved
itself superior to Oxford.
The confrontation took place at
Reading Head. Imperial were
contesting the inaugural race for the
Mackintosh Trophy, awarded to the
fastest university crew. Conditions
could hardly have been worse:
sporadic snowfalls and a strong wind
conspired against the competitors.
The wind whipped up large waves
and the snow dampened everyones'
enthusiasm for a fifteen minute race.
In a head race crews row over a set
course, one team following the next
after a gap of around fifteen seconds.
Hance, the result cannot be assessed
immedidately. Bill Mason (once
Olympic silver medallist) saw his first
eight row past three places behind
Oxford. IC Looked to be performing
so much below their usual potential
that Bill hardly recognised them. The
crew felt the same way about their
row and were utterly disconsolate.
Imagine their surprise the, when the
results were announced. Despite so
obviously failing to perform as
expected, IC beat Oxford and ran
away with the Mackintosh Trophy.
The second eight were likewise
frustrated with their performance.
But, their disappointment also belied
a magnificent performance. They
came second in the Mackintosh
Trophy and also second in the Senior
A division. Perhaps only four other
university first crews could perform
as well as this.
Imperial's success extended to the
two other crews racing. Imperial stole
the Senior C pennant and also won the
novice category. The Novices in
particular performed extraordinarily
well. They rowed in a thirty year-old
wooden boat, which looked quaint
and ungainly beside the modern
lightweight boats used by all their
adversaries. Despite this disadvantage
the novices, who all learned to row
at IC this year beat their nearest rivals
convincingly.

Pistol Competition, Wednesday March 4th; UCL,
Kings College, LSE and IC
Pistol over the opposition
Rifle and Pistol Club
It was 6 o'clock on March 4th when
the teams arrived at the range for the
ULU pistol competition, four teams
of four people were competing from
UCL, Kings College, the LSE and of
course IC. Each team member was to
shoot ten shots at each of two targets
giving a maximum team score of 800.
There was also to be an individual top
ten competition. As the competition
progressed it quickly became obvious
that only two teams would be in
contention for first place, IC and
Kings.
Although the scores were only
announced at the end, King's had
evidently been out-psyched by a
superb IC team performance. It began
when our first shooter S Considine
dropped one shot due to running out
of time and still scored more than
their best. Our next two both scored
very highly, tying for top score. The
honours went to P Deeks over S
Brooker on the number of inner bulls.
Even the supposed 'weak link' in the
form of last minute sub R Winskill
came 4th individually. When the final
scores were announced the expected
IC domination was confirmed. The
final scores were:
Team scores Individual comp.
IC 701 1) P Decks 180
King's 548 2) S Brooker 180
LSE 405 3) S Considine 174
UCL 327 4) R Winskill 167
Forename "nickname"

Once again, for the second season in
succession, RSM lsts have emerged
victorious, this time finishing as
champions of Division One by a
massive margin. The side maintained
its superb early form after the mad
beer-drinking excesses of Christmas
to vanquish the mealy-mouthed
opposition to all-comers, and earn the
right to hammer IC lsts into
submission next season, while at the
same time packing the yokels and
inbreeds of Camborne and Cardiff
back on their way by scores of 4-2
and 7-1 respectively.
The main deciding factor in the
team's triumph has to be its
consistency and lack of any one weak
link; everybody is equally crap! The
goalkeeper and singularly uninspiring
captain Andy 'Elephant Bottom'
Reeves had twenty six shots to save
all season, and twenty five of them
went in, the full backs Dave
Conneybeare and Tim Hardwick are
always steady (a.k.a. useless) while
the central defenders, Alex 'Chopper'
Wardle, Keith McScotty, Old Man
Nige Owen and Trevor Watkins are
all noted for leaving silvery trails
wherever they may go.
The midfield comprised Martin
Brook, Andy Lett, Steve Woodward,
Phil Fury, Gurel Turk and Dave
Bumzdoggs and they constituted the
most foul-mouthed, unpleasant,
unwashed, slovenly group of raving
homosexuals ever unfit to grace
God's clean earth. The attack scored
occasionally but was generally to be
seen disappearing over the horizon or
waving to the crowd. Still, Amin
Jafar Cake and Tim 'if it moves kick
it and if it doesn't, glass it' Fisher
made up the numbers and were
always good Canadians.
Eddie Gadd played once and got
cramp after twenty minutes. And
here, for the record, are the vital
statistics:

Football, Wednesday 4th March; IC 2, St George's 4 (Cobham)
Moral victory
After last Wednesday's victory over
St George's at Harlington, a slightly
different IC sixth team departed for
Cobham on 4th March for their last
game of the season.
The sixths were immediately
disadvantaged (not just by missing the
train) since this week's three mystery
players went by car and never
arrived. So, cruelly reduced to eight
men, the sixths, with a combination
of teamwork and an outstanding
performance in defence from Brian
Radukic, battled well and were
unlucky to be 3-1 down at half time.
The St George's goals all came from
penalty-area scrambles when the man
to man-and-a-half marking system
broke down.
In the second half St George's
scored after ten minutes to go. Irwin
Chin playing his last game for
Imperial again narrowed the deficit
with his second and better goal of the
match and season. Having rounded a
defender from Mike Harper's through
ball, a delicate chip beat the oncoming
goalkeeper, to make the score 4-2.
Swapping goalkeeper Mike Kemp
with the now cramp-stricken Irwin
Chin didn't produce any more goals
and so with a moral victory the sixths
retired to the bar to make the most of
a surfeit of tea tickets.
Thanks to all 36 players who have
made intermittent appearences this
season and have shown a level of
commitment and enthusiasm worthy
of any team in the club making my
job far easier. I hope they have
enjoyed playing as much as I have
enjoyed captaincy.
The team: M Kemp, I Chin, M
Harper, B Radukic, C Knight-
Evans, H Shah, A Bamford
(Capt), A Gamble. Missing
presumed dead: M Radley, R
Dark, K Hillier.
