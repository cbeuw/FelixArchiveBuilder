Letters FELIX, Wednesday March 18th 1987 4
Cwis wites
Dear David,
I must reply to Ian Howgate's
'Press Release' in FELIX 767, and
give the point of view of those
involved in the abstentions
'campaign'—something that was
noticeably lacking in the last issue.
The abstention 'campaign', by the
way was only started after it appeared
that the self confessed joke candidate,
Bill Goodwin, had a reasonable
chance of winning. We took it to a
UGM (the sovereign body of the
Union) which backed us in believing
in the right to abstain and the
necessity for publishing it.
What of the campaign itself? On the
scale of election campaigns, it was
tiny. No knocking on doors, no
leaflets, no harassment of the
electorate, just a couple of badges and
a handful of posters. I am surprised
that Ian blames this for the large
number of abstentions he found. The
first papers were put up on Thursday
evening, following the UGM. Ian
realised that abstentions might win the
following weekend, after the poster
had only been up for one day. A
successful campaign indeed. Perhaps
a more likely reason for the number
of abstentions would be the almost
complete lack of a campaign by either
of the candidates. They didn't even
bother to produce a handout (although
Ian did produce a large number of
copies of his 'Press Release' giving
his reasons for pulling out). It is rather
arrogant to suggest that students
should vote for you, if all they know
about you is a short speech to a UGM.
It was this complacency that lead to
the abstentions, the abstain campaign
only put the views of a large number
of students into words. The candidates
have only themselves to blame. Ian
might have his own reasons for
standing down, but looking for
scapegoats fools no one
Finally, it is rather presumptious
for Ian to assume the students do not
realise the consequences of
abstaining. If this is so they were
equally not aware of the consequences
of electing someone. Students are
rather less naive than he supposes,
and it is insulting for him to suggest
that we do not understand what we are
voting for if Ian had taken the
campaign as seriously as he took his
withdrawal, we might all be better
off.
Yours in reply,
Chris Martin, Doc PG.
Open door
Dear Editor,
With reference to the letter in
FELIX, Wednesday 11th March
1987, if the "group of civil
engineering students" wish to discuss
any greivance concerning the
Department, my door is always open.
Yours faithfully,
Patrick J Dowling, Head of
Department of Civil Engineering.
Look at me!
I'm the
President!
Dear Dave,
I'd like to comment on FELIX's
recent coverage of elections and
hustings. We all know how apathetic
IC is about things political but using
headlines like "Boring Elections"
and "More Boring Elections" would
seem to encourage the apathy.
Certainly the coverage was unduly
cynical.
The turnout for the RCS elections
may have been poor but 250 people
bothered to vote. How many will do
so again after reading the derisory
coverage in FELIX? The elections
and hustings were almost portrayed
as a standing joke.
The piece on the RCS election
results wasn't even factually correct
(Fiona Nicholas is Life Sci not
Physics). Union elections are news
stories and deserve to be covered as
such—accurately and without bias.

RCS President Elect

Election Blues
Ian Howgate's decision to withdraw
from the election for ICU President
has got to be one of the most childish
acts by any sabbatical candidate. No
doubt he feels that the meagre abstain
campaign was directed at him
personally; he is quite right to think
so. The students who advocated
abstention had been very unimpressed
by his histrionic performances at ICU
Council. Though none of them were
prepared to oppose him, it was
grossly arrogant of Ian to opt out of
serious campaigning in the way that
he did. I agree it is difficult to
approach elections in a positive
manner when there is only a half-
serious candidate standing against
you, but this is no excuse for
degrading the election procedure by
adopting a half-serious approach
yourself. It was this action which
precipitated the abstain campaign.
Ian's argument that neither he nor Bill
Goodwin would be in a position to run
again after a 'victory' for abstentions
just doesn't wash; he is in a far less
credible position to stand a second
time after pulling out once, much in
the same impulsive manner as he is
given to storming out of Council. The
onus is always on the candidate to
prove his or her worth. The
emergence of a (limited) abstain
campaign should not affect this.
inconvenienced by the College

IC cannot afford to drain more
resources away from teaching. UGC
cuts and the Government's education
policies have already contrived to
overemphasise the value of research
work. If this trend is allowed to
continue, the College Governers can
expect to read far more FELIX letters
like the one which caused such
concern last week.
Note on letters page
The talks by Messrs Howe and
Sinclair were not covered because I
forgot about them (again). Cecil
Parkinson's address was not covered
because he said nothing of any
significance.
Earlier this term FELIX was
attacked for giving too many column
inches to Leon Brittan and Peter
Goosen of the South African
Embassy. Our policy is to cover as
much news as we can as accurately
as possible. If there are any more self-
righteous bigots who are thinking of
writing in they can save themselves
the trouble; I have no interest in this
sort of correspondence.
And nowfor the good news Credits
Last Friday Governing Body
announced a cut of 100 jobs, to be
spread across all areas of staffing.
Where this is to mean a drop in the
number of academic staff (and it is a
possibility that this will be where
major reductions are made) the policy
will be to transfer staff to research
contracts, and take them off the
payroll. Hence there will be more
staff engaged solely in research work,
and fewer teaching students.
At the same time Governing Body
have "noted' the College policy to
increase the number of overseas
students by an additional 100 in
October 1988. This is on top of
increases which were already
planned. The general attitude at
Governing Body was that "it has to
be done," which, I suppose, is a
practical view. Once again, however,
it will be students who are most
