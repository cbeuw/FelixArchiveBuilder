Clubs FELIX, Wednesday March 18th 1987 1 3
Water Polo Saturday 28th Feb; IC in 4th position
Refreshing game
IC waterpolo team's first match in this
year's U A U national finals in
Shrewsbury was a comfortable 14-6
victory over Sheffield. The result
made IC overnight leaders with the
evening's other two matches,
Birmingham vs Liverpool and
Liverpool vs Bristol ending in draws.
IC's first game on Saturday, against
our arch-rivals Bristol, was closely
fought as expected. For 3 Vi quarters
there was nothing to choose between
the sides at 5-5, but with about 2
minutes left Bristol edged ahead.
They added another in the closing
seconds as IC threw everything
forward in an attempt to equalise.
IC's next game against Liverpool
was another hard fought contest with
neither side giving anything away.
However, a loss of concentration in
the 3rd quarter saw IC slip from 5-4
up to 10-5 down. A spiritedfightback
in the 4th quarter ensued but with time
on their side Liverpool finished 11-8
winners.
As IC entered the last game of the
tournament, against Birmingham, we
knew we could only finish 4th.
However, Birmingham needed to win
to take the trophy, a draw or loss
allowing Liverpool overall victory.
So Birmingham won the trophy
again. As for IC, we won much praise
for our play, the quality of which is
not reflected in our overall position
of 4th. The whole 13 played their best
in this fine team performance but
special praise must go to the first 7
players whose resilience and
determination took us "so near—and
yet so far!"
The team: D Wall (C), R
Pearson, P Richardson, A
Langman, S Davis, J Street, N.
Irland, M Dixon, N Mayall, P
Jackson, N Rothwell, P Dunne, J

Hockey Sunday 8th March Stephenson's Cup
Inter CCU competition
Last Sunday at Harlington the three
CCU hockey teams met to play for the
Stephenson's Cup. The first game
was between RSM and RCS. RSM
finished the first half leading by only
1-0 despite much pressure. The
second half was very hard fought, the
final score being a 2-2 draw. The next
game between RSM and C & G saw
a relatively uneventful first half but
within 30 seconds of the second half
RSM had taken the lead thanks to
Mark Rayfield. This was to set the
tempo of the rest of the game, the
final score being 4-3 to RSM.
This left RCS with the task of
beating C & G by two goals to be sure
of winning the cup. They began well,
taking a 2-0 lead fairly early on
against a slightly tired looking C &
G. However, C & G did not give up
by any means but battled back to draw
the game 2-2, their second goal
coming from a short corner within
seconds of the final whistle. As a
result RSM retained the Stephenson's
Cup for the second year, thus
rounding off a very successful season
in which they also beat Camborne and
almost certainly gained promotion
into the ULU first division.

Bridge too
far
The intrepid bridge club team made
a trip to the frozen wastelands of Bath
to meet the country bumpkins in the
quarter finals of the Portland Bowl—
the premier knockout universities
teams competition.
Having brilliantly trounced Reading
University in the last round by turning
up, we prepared for the next round
of battle by pitching camp in Bath,
flying the IC flag. After arduous
discussion of bidding and tactical
strategy, the team lost the
psychological advantage by playing
Black Maria to the early hours of
Sunday morning.
This may have accounted for being
31 International Match Points down
at the half way stage—equivalent to
being 1.0-0 down to Liverpool. Inspite
of.. .look, you lot, this bitjust doesn't
make any sense at all...put up a
valiant rearguard action to spin off
three small slams in a row to pull back
25 IMPs in the next quarter.
After this breath taking comeback
from the brink our heroes go forward
to the finals of the Portman Bowl at
the Cafe Royale over Easter.
FilmSoc presents...
Walt Disney Double Bill
This Thursday (March 19th) IC Film
Soc presents a Walt Disney double
bill starting with The Sword in the
Stone and followed by Winnie the
Pooh and Tigger Too in Mech Eng
220 (doors 7.30pm).
Walt Disney: American animator
and executive whose name is a
household word all over the world.
Formerly a commercial artist he
produced his first Mickey Mouse
cartoon in 1928, using his own voice.
He then went on to make some of the
best movies ever and managed to pick
up four Special Academy Awards and
twenty-one (to my knowledge)
Acadamy Awards for shorts. We have
picked two of the best examples of his
work available on 16mm
The Sword in the Stone is set in the
dark ages. A young forest boy named
Wart becomes King Arthur. This
feature Cartoon with several excellent
sequences was one of the last of a
dying breed. Soon after, economy of
draughtsmanship showed up in a
flatness on the screen.
Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too—
this classic tale needs no introduction.
If you have seen it you no doubt will
want to see it again, and if you
haven't seen it then don't waste this
opportunity of seeing this classic
cartoon.
£1.00 non-members, 50p members.

Thank you
The Environmental Society would
like to express its thanks to all those
who gave their support to
Environmental Week, which was held
in the College from March 6th—J 1th.
The money raised through donations
to the JCR stall and by the sale of
books and posters will be donated to
a Third World charity, so the week
has been of benefit to the needy as
well as an important step towards
increasing environmental awareness.
Particular thanks are due to the
many people who gave up their spare
time to help organise the events, run
the stall, and write articles for
FELIX; also to the College authorities
and IC Union for giving financial and
material support.
Finally we must congratulate Stuart
McFarlane, who has invested a huge
amount of time and effort, on a
mission accomplished. Without
Stuart's hard work and dedication,
Environmental Week would never
have got off the ground, let alone been
such a success.
Wise Owl
Sir Geoffrey Howe came to IC two
weeks ago and spoke to almost 200
people about the Government's
foreign policy and the benefits of free
market economies to developing
nations. He explained how "London
School of Economics Socialism" has
failed to help particular African states
combat famine and disease, while a
free market approach has enabled
poverty to be overcome in
comparable nations.
The Foreign Secretary put forward
an alternative view of scientific
developments and new technology to
those of Huxley's "Brave New
World," saying that modern
communications are forcing
totalitarian states to become more
open, as has been observed in Russia.
As to the West's approach to
countries "East of the Iron Curtain"
Sir Geoffrey reminded us that the
Government's policy of negotiating
about arms from a position of equality
has resulted in Mr Gorbachev making
proposals to reduce the number of all
intermediate range missiles. Sir
Geoffrey was certainly not advocating
indiscriminate building of nuclear
weaponry; he explained how a
dialogue between the two sides of the
Iron Curtain must be developed to
create greater understanding and
respect between the nations.
