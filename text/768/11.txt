Opinion FELIX, Wednesday March 18th 1987
Glad to be gay, sad to be hated
In the past month or so a great deal
of attention has been devoted to the
subject of Gay and Lesbian people at
Imperial College, with the co-opting
onto Council of Robert Daniel as
Lesbian and Gay welfare officer
leading to a healthy level of debate in
the FELIX letters page.
The above decision has been
criticised, albeit constructively, by
many who in my opinion do not fully
understand the situation. I must admit
that the atmosphere at Imperial
College towards minorities is
improving, however slowly. I don't
think that this is nearly enough.
One of the functions of any
education should be, as the cliche has
it, to prepare the individual for life. My
interpretation of this is that the
childhood or teenage prejudices
people entertain when they arrive
here should for the most part have
vanished by the time they leave,
hopefully producing a generation of
responsible and open minded adults.
I believe that with respect to the
average attitude to homosexuality,
Imperial is failing, and badly.
For Gays and Lesbians, the
atmosphere here is not good. The
degree of hostility and ignorance
displayed by some has to be seen to
be believed. All the old cliches which
I thought had gone for good have
been trotted out in conversation by
people who I had previously regarded
as being intelligent and aware. Lines
like:
"Of course, when queer men do it,
there's so much blood about"
"While you are setting up a Gaysoc,
why don't you set up a Child Molester
soc for good measure?"
"Most Of these homos are commies
you know."
"Hitler may have been rough on the
Jews, but he had the right idea about
pansies."
—and one which really made me
laugh:
"I don't mind you being..er..gay, but
you'd better keep away from my
daughter!"
No, I don't understand that one
either.
Seeing these stupidities in cold print
does make you realise that society in
general, and Imperial in particular, has
a problem. People don't seem to
realise that such statements can be
extremely hurtful. Even the best we
can expect is not great. Several people
have said to me:
"It's OK by me if you're gay, as long
as you don't mess with me."
I suppose this is well meant, but I still
find it rather insulting. Why should I
want to mess with them anyway? As
for the other sentiments above, I can
assure readers that 1 am not a commie
or a child molester, and if there really
was a lot of blood about when I 'did
it' I certainly wouldn't 'do it' atall.
Mind you, remember that this sort
of thing is about the best we can
expect from a lot of people. The worst
can be very bad indeed.
I spent my last summer vacation at
home in Cornwall, and towards the
end of the holiday I was attacked by
three men with knives; despite my
best efforts I wound up in hospital. The
reason for the attack was simple: They
had discovered that I was gay. This
was the only reason. I had neither
robbed them, assaulted them or
threatened them. 1 didn't even know
them. I am sure you can understand
my wish to promote a society in which
this doesn't happen.
How can this be done? Obviously,
people have to be shown that their
fears and prejudices are groundless.
Gays and Lesbians need to stand up
and say:"Look, here I am. I'm not so
bad really, am I?"
1 realise that this is the hell of a step
to take. I should know: I have.
Encouragingly, at least at Imperial, I
have had very little hassle...yet.
Having said that, it is not for me to tell
people to 'come out of the closet' at
Imperial. This is a decision which can
only be made by the individual. I do
feel, though, that the more who do
this, the better it will be for all of us,
gay or not. Remember that many here
have never met anyone who has
declared themselves homosexual:
How can they know what we are like?
In years to come, 1 would like to be
able to write about this subject without
using the words 'us' and 'them'. If this
is to happen, the change must come
from everyone.
Let's try, shall we?

UROP '87
The 1987 Directory for the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Programme is now available from your
Departmental Vacation Training Officer. About 120 members
of staff are offering undergraduates the chance to join in their
research and the Directory gives the details.
The name of the game is participation and undergraduates
joining the scheme will be working, in their own time,
alongside postgraduates and research assistants, on an actual
research programme. Whilst you can start at any time, the
main activities are in the vacations. In the summer, many
of the supervisors are able to offer payment for your efforts.
The scheme is organised so that the payment is in the form
of a bursary, so you don't pay tax or NH1 contributions and
foreign students do not need a work permit. Whilst the
amount is negotiable with your supervisor, the recommended
maximum is £75 per week for ten weeks.
This year the Old Centralians are offering some summer
bursaries for City & Guilds students to work in UROP.
Applications have to be in by the end of term.
After a successful try-out last year, the University of
Delaware in the States is offering five UROP places for IC
students this summer. Details are given in the Directory.
To get your copy, see your Departmental Vacation Training
Officer or contact Professor J C Anderson, Room 713,
Electrical Engineering Department.
