Bar Accounts
Dear Martin
Since you have mentioned my
name in your last editorial as
pressing for bar accounts to be
available to the Bar Committee I
would appreciate the opportu-
nity to say why.
The Bar Committee's terms of
reference which we assumed
valid, and were never challenged
were provided by M r I Thomas
(Domestic Manager and Secre-
tary to the Refectory Committee)
who had them since he joined
the Bar Committee. No other
terms of reference have ever
reached the Bar Committee.
Section 3 of these terms of
reference reads as follows:
3. The duties of the Sub-
Committees are:
a) To report on all matters of
p o l i c y a n d f i n a n c e to the
Refectory Committee.
b) To advise the Refectory
M a n a g e r on the day-to-day
running of the bars and the
c o n t i n u a l s u p e r v i s i o n and
finance.
My interpretation of these
duties of the Committee was that
they could not be fulfilled
without access to the accounts—
especially with the word "fin-
ance" appearing twice.
Yours sincerely
Roy Francis.
Mary Freeman
Dear Sir
As an ex-student who took a
keen interest in the workings of
the Union, may I offer a few!
comments on the resignation of
Mary Freeman. While the short
term effect—an increase work-
load on the President and the
permanent staff—may appear to
be of no real concern to the
'average' student, the long-term
effects are. While clubs, societies,
etc, depend, in the short-term,
on the enthusiasm of their
members, some areas of Union
activity (eg the allocation of the
ICU grant from College, insur-
ance) need to be c e n t r a l l y
administered (whether this is by
sabbaticals or permanent staff is
another question).
Mary Freeman, was according
to London Student, elected on a
'breath of fresh air' platform,
Page 61
i m p l y i n g that by h a v i n g a
sabbatical who, in some way,
was not part of 'the system', the
Union could be run in a way that
would prove more satisfactory
to its members. I would criticise
this idea on two grounds: firstly,
I disagree that ideas are 'fresher'
for h a v i n g been d e v e l o p e d
outside the system (or that they
must be staler for having been
produced 'inside') and, secondly,
because this idea fails to recog-
nise the reality of a bureaucratic
organisation such as IC inevit-
ably is. Anyone who has ever
taken part in a c o m m i t t e e
meeting will realise that discus-
sions are far from being dis-
passionate and objective but,
especially when the members
present are there to represent a
particular interest or viewpoint
(as occurs on I C U Council for
e x a m p l e ) , d i s c u s s i o n s c a n
sometimes degenerate to the
point where they become attacks
on individuals and not the issues
involved, as anyone who has
heard a debate in Parliament will
know.
To sum up, I would say to
anyone considering standing for
a sabbatical post—be sure to
develop a thickish skin, and to
people voting—you would not
choose someone who said that
they had never seen a newspaper
to be the next F E L I X Editor.

Dear Martin
As residents of one of the
Head Tenancy flats in Hamlet
Gardens, we wish to draw the
attention of your readers to the
disturbing discovery we have
made.
By chance, we have found
that keys to at least two other
flats in Hamlet Gardens (one of
which is not a student flat)
unlock our front door; and that
our key unlocks at least one
other flat.
When we visited the Student
Manager for the flats, M r James
Donaldson, to request a new
lock, we were told that it was
very unlikely that anything
could be done about it in the
near future, and that we would
be heavily fined if we fitted a
new lock ourselves.
We protest very strongly
about this unsatisfactory state of
affairs.

Bo Belle
Dear Mr Taylor
I was appalled at last week's
article concerning myself written
by M r Greenstreet. I found it to
be an insulting travesty of the
truth.
I was amazed at the 'gentle-
man's' extra-sensory powers of
perception in making such astute
comments about Bo-Belle. Just
as well that Mr Nathan and Mr
Stein were u n a v a i l a b l e for
comment, otherwise they would
have been branded as 'hunky Mr
Universe men' who had for
weeks been 'wowing the lasses of
RCS'.
As you are obviously unaware,
Guilds and Guildsheet are non-
sexist o r g a n i s a t i o n s unlike
yourselves.
I remain, sir, the 1982 Bo-
Belle selected by open and fair
competition based purely on the
knowledge of Bo!
Yours disappointedly
Miss Miranda Bellchambers
Dear Sir
I am writing to you concerning
the inaccurate ideas portrayed
by the 'Bo Belle' news item.
To begin with the article
appears to be a protest on
Miranda's behalf for not being
able to travel in Bo to Brighton.
C o n s i d e r i n g that a l t h o u g h
disappointed she accepted the
reason why this could not be so
and that this article presents her
as a sex symbol and not as a
young lady engineer keen to
encourage more interest in Bo.
For these reasons I am in no
doubt as to the embarassment
this article must have caused
Miranda and I hope Phil Green-
street has the courtesy to
apologise.
M y other c o n c e r n is the
reference to the four seater car
being full of Guilds hacks. Phil
obviously knows little about the
car and the facts concerning
those who travel in him. Bo is in
fact a five seater but due to his
age only four people travel in
him on a long journey such as.
that to Brighton. Two of these
seats are taken by driver and co-
d r i v e r and a t h i r d by the
President of C & G Union for
whom Bo is official transport.
The f o u r t h place o f f i c i a l l y
belongs to Sir Hugh Ford in
whose name the ownership of
the car is registered. If he should
decide not to travel in the car
then it is up to the discretion of
the driver to decide who else
should travel in the car. Gen-
erally this person is someone
who has knowledge of and
experience with the mechanics
and electrics of the car should
such expertise be required in the
event of a breakdown.
Yours factually
Nigel Simmonds
Dear Sir
I take exception to the small
misleading parts of Mr Green-
street's article on 'Bo Belle': 'full
of Guilds hacks'. To concede the
only possible fragment of truth I
myself was one of the four;
hence possibly one seat was
occupied by a 'hack'. Though it
should not be surprising or
objectionable that the President
travels on Bo; as with all the
motorised mascots he is the
President's official transport.
The other three seats were
occupied by: the Bo Driver, this
is a skilled job and cannot be
substituted; the Co-Driver, it is
necessary for someone with
experience as Bo needs two
people to drive him. On the
Brighton Run two Co-Drivers
were used, to involve more
p e o p l e ; the m e c h a n i c , any
complaints?
Apart from myself the other
four people could not be con-
sidered hacks, their involvement
and resulting trip to Brighton is
based on the long hours they
spend Working on Bo, and the
expertise they possess. I would
prefer articles in the new look
and large edition of F E L I X to
refrain from personal coloura-
tions except where applicable:
editorials, Below the Belt, Soap
Box, etc.
Yours faithfully

The President's
Hat
November 12,19821
Dear Sirs
I wish to p o i n t out the
following referring to your
Below The Belt column of last
week concerning the hat.
1. I was not at the time of the
incident, wearing the now grey
hat. My (unnamed) ladyfriend
was.
2. We (my ladyfriend and I)
were not h i d i n g in a shop
doorway but we were standing
on the pavement of Earls Court
Road heading towards Cromwell
Road having just passed two
officers of the Met, when the
incident occurred.
I hope (we hope) that this will
surpress any malicious rumours
about me and the unnamed Miss
.X.
Yours faithfully
Gareth Fish
