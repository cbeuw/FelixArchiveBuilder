One of the very great pleasures of the
National Gallery is that the collection there is
such a superb one. Unfortunately, that is also
its great drawback. Y o u are almost bound to
k n o w the pictures, from mediocre repro-
ductions the size of postage stamps—seeing
them 'in the flesh' may force you to rethink
some cherished preconceptions; and, being
one of London's major tourist attractions, it is
jam-packed full of conducted tours which
surge round in disordered fashion, en route
from the Changing of the G u a r d at Bucking-
ham Palace to Westminster Abbey!
The day I was there, the Gallery was full of
Russians; they were all wearing bright group
badges, were being counted in and out of each
room by solidly-built 'guides' and were to be
escorted back to the South C<->ast, to spend
the night on their ship...the temptation to
defect apparently becomes harder to resist the
longer one is exposed to Capitalist city life.

National Gallery occupies the north side-of the
square and, today, looks very much as it did
when first opened to the public on April 9 1938.
Extensions have since been added behind the
original building; the first in 1876, designed by
E M Barry, architect of the Royal Opera
H o u s e , C o v e n t G a r d e n . C u r r e n t l y , a n
extension to the west of the original building is
planned, and will occupy what is now an N C P
car park.
Britain's Golden Age
T o d a y , t h e T a t e h o u s e s t h e N a t i o n a l
Collection of British Painting; since 1946 more
than 300 pictures, previously at the National
Gallery, have been transferred there. The
pictures of the British School which remain in
Trafalgar Square are almost all of the great
period, the century and a quarter that lies
between the first works of Hogarth and the last
of Turner.
Throughout the 18th Century a growing
class of wealthy and cultured people created a
demand for portraiture. This was the age of
G a r r i c k a n d D r J o h n s o n , of p e a c e a n d
prosperity under the reigns of the Hanoverian
Georges, the age which saw the birth of the
Romantic movement. Thomas Gainsborough
(1727-1788) was not only a highly successful
portrait-painter, but an excellent, romantic
landscape painter—a form which he himself
preferred. In Room 39 hangs Gainsborough's
joint portrait of ' M r and M r s Andrews.' It is a
s u p e r b c o m b i n a t i o n of l a n d s c a p e a n d
portraiture. M r Andrews looks serious, but is a
little smug: his pretty wife and his fine estate
are pictured together for all to admire. The
c o u p l e is y o u n g a n d u n s o p h i s t i c a t e d .
G a i n s b o r o u g h ' s obvious sympathy for his
subject makes it a very charming picture.
Quite different is his style in the portrait of
M r s S i d d o n s in R o o m 38. G a i n s b o r o u g h
p a i n t e d t h e a c t r e s s in 1785, i n a r i c h ,
expressive manner. She is elegantly dressed;
her clear, powdered skin and smooth shining
silk dress contrast with the dark, glowing
background and with the fluffy textures of hair,
fur and feathers. She is not a classic beauty
(her nose is too long!) but is compelling, and
embodies all the grace and apparent ease of
the 18th Century.
A couple of steps from M r s Siddons, but
socially all the way to the East E n d , is
Hogarth's 'Shrimp Girl'. H e r smile, under the
b r o a d b a s k e t p i l e d w i t h s h r i m p s a n d
measuring cup, is delightful. The sketching is
vivacious, and what the face lacks in firmness
and solidity is more than made up for by its
animation.
Maria Ana de Pontejos ,
The Marquesa de Pontejos, by Franciso de
G o y a (1746 1828), is on view in Room 41.
What is interesting about this picture of the
S p a n i s h S c h o o l , is that G o y a ' s style of
fashionable portraiture is very reminiscent of
Gainsboroughs. G o y a painted the Marquesa
in about 1786 with an idyllic landscape as a
b a c k d r o p . H o w e v e r , unlike M r a n d M r s
Andrews, she does not belong in her setting
and stands rather stiffly, showing-off her
fashion-plate clothes.
The National Gallery has provided a good
sheet of background blurb about each picture,
which you can pick up in Room 41.

PINCCCMIO
Perola's Puzzle
A s you may have noticed, last week saw the
timely demise of the folding machine. That,
however, was the least of our problems! The
printing machine was upset by a gremlin, and
many of the sixteen pages were printed in the
wrong positions, so that the page numbers
were all mixed.
The first person to notice this was Andy
Mann, who had been taking the pages from the
folding machine while it was still working.
"Each sheet has been folded like this," he said,
holding up a page as in the diagram: A , B, C
and D are the page numbers. "In every case,
the page numbers are arranged in ascending
order; that is, A < B < C < D , each page number
has been p r i n t e d exactly o n c e , a n d the
numbers on any one sheet add up to 34, as
usual."
' " A h . y e s , " said the E d i t o r M S T (Mildly
Shocked Team-leader) when he spotted the
mistake, "but there are no two consecutive
numbers on any sheet, in any position, not
even in the wrong places! Fortunately the front
page, back page and editorial (page 5) are in
the right positions, so perhaps nobody will
notice."
"If we weren't just about to distribute this, I
could use this as a puzzle," I said, "although I'd
have to add that on the sheet with the editorial,
no one page number is twice another."
Luckily, at this point the matter was put
right by a magician who just happened to be
h a n g i n g a r o u n d t h e office ( a l t h o u g h he
couldn't do anything with the folding machine!)
so I have set this as a puzzle—what was the
original order of the pages?
I am indebted for this little gem of a puzzle to
my good friend Perola, who has also given me
a puzzle that you're going to be faced with
when I feel evil enough.
Solutions, comments,criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. £5 from
Mend-a-Bike and an evening out with the
folding machine (special prize!) for randomly
selected entry.
Last Week's Solution
Alright, I admit it! T h e r e were several
correct solutions to last week's puzzle and
here's the proof of those solutions:
If we take the two abaci shown, which show
364 and 561, and let x, y, x' and y' represent
the number of spare balls on the rungs shown,
any spare on the top rung being irrelevant,
then equating the numbers on the abaci,
3 (6 + x + 1)(4 + y + 1) + 6(4 + y + 1) + 4 =
5(6 + x' + 1)(1 + y' + 1) + 6(1 + y' + 1) + 1
3(7 + x)(5 + y) + 6(5 + y) + 3 =
5(7 + x')(2 + y') + 6(2 + y')
105 + 15x + 21y + 3xy + 30 + 6y + 3 =
70 + iOx' + 35y' + 5x'y' + 12 + 6y'
10x' - 15x + 41y' - 27y + 5x'y' - 3xy = 56
which is solved by:
x = y = 0; x' = y' = 1; no. = 139
x = 1, y = 0, x' = 2, y' = 1; no. = 154
x = 2, y = 0, x' = 3, y' = 1; no. = "169
x = 3, y = 2, x' = 2, y' = 3; no. = 256
x = x' = 0, y = y' = 4; no. = 247
There were only two people who found all
five solutions; the winner chosen was P G
Bevan of M e c h Eng 1, but commiserations to
Leann Jones of Maths 2, the unlucky loser. P
G Bevan can collect the £5 cheque after
1:30pm on Monday.
Hopefully, the solution to this week's puzzle
is unique, and I have checked it (but then
again, I thought I'd checked last weeks!).
Cheques are still awaiting collection from
the F E L I X Office by the following prize
winners: K e n Morrison, Sandra Gould and
Song F u .
