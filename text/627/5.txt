Biochemistry Society
Last week F E L I X printed a
story about the Biochemistry
department under the headline
'We've been ripped off!' Com-
plaints about this article were
received from senior staff in the
Biochemistry department, from
the Biochemical Society and
from R C S U , and in view of
these, some e x p l a n a t i o n is
needed.
The article was criticised as
factually inaccurate, both by
Karl Schmidt and Chas Fuller of
R C S U who complained that 'a
lot of the facts were incorrect'
and by Dr Dickerson in the
department who described the
article as 'almost wholly er-
roneous'.
M r Schmidt in his letter
quotes F E L I X as saying '...with-
out the c o m b i n e d f u n d i n g ,
( B i o c h e m Soc) w o u l d have
overrun their budget by Christ-
mas' and goes on to say 'This is
grossly incorrect, as will be
verified by either Chris Bruton
R C S U Senior Treasurer or Tony
Lai President of Biochem Soc'
Tony Lai was our original
source, so we checked with him
and he agreed that, while it was
difficult to be precise about
hypothetical future financial
dealings, the facts as reported
were broadly correct.
D r B a r n a r d , H e a d of the
Biochemistry Department states
in his letter that '. . . (the
department) has never, in the
past two years or at any other
time,...required our postgrad-
uates to attend...lectures pro-
vided by R C S U . ' Yet a letter
circulated by D r Dickerson to
postgraduates two years ago
states 'All graduate students are
expected to attend...the IC
Biochemical Society lectures.
Questions on these may be put
to the student...at the PhD oral
examination'. D r Dickerson has
since told F E L I X that this
demand was orally withdrawn
six months after the letter was
issued (although several post-
grads we questioned seemed
unaware of the fact); this was
• done in response to a complaint
by one Nick Morton, ex-ICU
President.
When F E L I X stated that 'for
the last two years lectures
arranged with R C S U funds have
been used as part of post-
graduates' examinable course'
we were taking i n f o r m a t i o n
f r o m D r D i c k e r s o n ' s (still
current) letter; we had no way of
knowing that the offensive
clause had been orally with-
drawn. But nevertheless, in view
of the initial six months, D r
Barnard's letter is shown to be
incorrect.

EDITORIAL
Apart from this, though, no
one has indicated any errors of
fact in the article at all.
The other criticism levelled at
F E L I X was that the wording of
the article endorsed the (in-
corect) ideas exposed in RCSU's
Broadsheet. This criticism is to
some extent justified, and we
apologise to all those who felt
that the negotiations between
R C S U and the department were
prejudiced because of what was
written. It is going too far,
though, to suggest as K a r l
Schmidt does that F E L I X is
lowering its standards to that of
The Sun or even (heaven forbid)
The Daily Telegraph. The point is
worthy of some comment under
a new heading.
FELIX and The Sun
F E L I X caters for Imperial
College students, who are, by
and large, of above average
intelligence. We therefore try to
write articles i n t e l l i g e n t l y ,
coherently and straightforward-
ly, sticking to established fact as
far as possible, and attempting
to m a i n t a i n a style w h i c h
c o m b i n e s interest with the
dignity of clear, concise English.
With a news staff of one and
much of the important news
happening on Thursday lunch-
times, this is difficult, but we do
our best. If anyone feels that
F E L I X does read like The Sun, I
suggest they firstly compare the
two papers' style a little more
carefully, and consider how we
could write up some of our news
if we tried, ('It was a red-letter
day for top IC boss Lord F when
he got the plum job on the
college bosses' committee') and
secondly that they join the news
staff and try to change things. It
is not stooping to sensationalism
when we report on various
p e r s o n s ' or o r g a n i s a t i o n s '
misdeeds ('exposure' is the
tabloidese for this) provided, of
course that we get our facts
right.
There are exceptions. We
occasionally deliberately parody
The Sun, as we did last week with
the ' B o Belle' article. M o r e
importantly, in our headlines we
tend to less formality than
serious national papers, and for
a variety of good reasons. Firstly,
we feel the average student
prefers a succinct and witty
headline to a longer, more
detailed one. ' N O F L O W E R S
BY R E Q U E S T ' is more fun than
' U G M refuses to buy M a r y
Freeman roses as parting ges-
ture'. Secondly, when the news
isn't exactly earth-shattering
(and it frequently isn't) a longer,
serious headline appears un-
bearably pompous and dry.
' W H E R E W E R E Y O U ? ' puts
much more interest into a dull
story than ' U G M Inquorate
Again'. Thirdly, the purpose of a
headline in, say, The Times, is to
briefly inform you of the point
of the story so that you can
choose whether to read the
details. In F E L I X there are only
a dozen or so news stories at
most, and nearly everyone will
read all of them anyway. Fourthly •
and lastly there is the visual
argument. F E L I X (and The Sun)
have small pages—that's what
'tabloid' means—and to take up
space with l o n g e r , serious
headlines in smaller print looks
ridiculous.
But apart f r o m ' s p l a s h '
banner headlines, we do seriously
try to report the news in an
intelligent and concise manner
which will appeal to the reader-
ship of a university newspaper,
and we resent allegations that
F E L I X reads like a newspaper
designed to appeal to people
with lazy minds who appreciate
emotional phrasing of the news.
In general, we succeed in these
aims, but if you disagree there's
plenty of room on the news staff.
Bar Accounts
(Second Canto)
As the U G M motion is carried
on Tuesday instructing the Exec
actively to campaign for open
bar accounts, more people are
taking sides, and taking them
more vehemently, and an inter-
esting distinction is becoming
apparent. People such as Stephen
Goulder, D r Bob Schroter, and
Karl Schmidt, who have access
to the accounts, want to keep
them secret. ( M r S c h m i d t ,
although he does not have direct
access to the figures, claims to
want them withheld because he
has 'discovered the main trends
through discreet enquiries').
People who do not have access
to the accounts, such as Deputy
President J o h n M c C a l l i o n ,
H o n o r a r y S e c r e t a r y A n d y
Grimshaw, myself, and, in view
of last Tuesday's vote, the
electorate at a U G M , are all
'seeking either open accounts or
a sensible reason for withholding
them. It is particularly ridiculous
not to show M r McCallion the
account, since as a student
r e p r e s e n t a t i v e o n the B a r
Subcommittee he has to advise
the Refectories Committee on
matters of finance. How they
can expect this without showing
him the accounts defies explana-
tion.
But do they expect this? What
are the Bar Subcommittee's
duties as outlined in the Terms
of Reference? Stephen Goulder
November 12, 1982
and Roy Francis disagreed when
they were q u e s t i o n e d (not
surprisingly) and each insisted
he was right and the Terms of
Reference supported his view-
point. One man's word against
another, so they were asked to
check exactly how the Terms
were worded. U n f o r t u n a t e l y
each has a different copy of the
Terms of Reference worded in
just such a way as to support his
own viewpoint
But M r G o u l d e r ' s ' o f f i c i a l
position on the matter is quite
interesting, too. The motion
c a r r i e d at T u e s d a y ' s U G M
instructs the Union Council to
ensure that its nominees to
College committees will cam-
paign for open bar accounts as
Mr Goulder has been quick to
point out, the Union represen-
tatives on the Subcommittee are
J o h n M c C a l l i o n a n d J o h n
Passmore. As an appointee of
the Refectories Committee, he
says, he himself is not a student
"representative. Is this why he is
not representing the students'
views?
Meanwhile the excuses from
the closed acounts lobby get
sillier and more desperate: 'Open
bar accounts will make it too
obvious if the bar staff aren't
working efficiently' or 'Why ask
about bars anyway? Wouldn't it
be better to start with refec-
tories?'
No, the longer D r Schroter
a n d M r G o u l d e r keep the
accounts secret, the more it will
make people wonder what is
being c o v e r e d u p . C e r t a i n
rumourmongers are already
alleging specific irregularities,
and the only way to stem their
gossip is to publish the accounts. -
U n l e s s , of c o u r s e , there is
something which the p u b l i c
mustn't discover.
F E L I X Dinner
The ad with all the details is on
page 2, but the most important
detail is missing, namely that
everyone is welcome, not just
F E L I X hacks.
Feature Articles
There are ideas and invitations
in abundance for F E L I X feature
articles. How would you bike
to...make a parachute jump, fly
in a balloon, be shown round the
laserium camera, test commer-
cial sex aids...? A l l these and
more (at the expense o f the
companies concerned) to anyone
who will write an article about
the experience for F E L I X .
A p p l i c a t i o n s to the F E L I X
Editor, any Monday or Friday.
Impossible Without
All the people who usually help,
and also John Lyle who came to
mend the folding machine so
promptly.
