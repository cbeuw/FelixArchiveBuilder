Biochem Lectures: Who's Paying?
Impartiality in
FELIX News
Dear Sir
Regarding your report on last
week's Debating Society motion
to abolish private education:
Y o u r correspondent uses the
phrase " Sir Ashley (the pro-
poser) betrayed his position as
socialist chairman of the G L C in
a n a t t a c k o n C o n s e r v a t i v e
Government educational p o l i -
cies."
M y own impression was that
Sir Ashley's well argued attack
(on this government's appallingly
short-sighted, ill-considered, and
m e t h o d i c a l d e s t r u c t i o n o f
Britain's education system at all
levels) did in fact honour and
credit Sir Ashley's position as
C h a i r m a n of the G L C . (The
G L C is, inter alia, charged with
providing education for residents
of Inner London.) Perhaps your
correspondent has 'betrayed' his
p o s i t i o n as a ' r e a c t i o n a r y
c a p i t a l i s t bent o n d e f e n d i n g
privilege, and lowering standards
of education' (and of journalism
as well, if that is possible!).
I a m aware of F E L I X ' s short-
age of reporters and stringers
(and that there is no tradition of
i m p a r t i a l i t y i n t h e B r i t i s h
p r e s s ! ) , but I w o n d e r i f y o u
could include, if not a full byline,
then at least the initials of those
responsible for each item. Even
the Daily Telegraph does not fill
every page with unattributable
'editorials'.
Yours attributably

From the officers of Biochem Soc
Dear Editor
We are writing with regard to
the f r o n t p a g e h e a d l i n e i n
F E L I X November 5 issue in an
effort to clarify the incorrect
i n f o r m a t i o n p u b l i s h e d i n the
article.
F o r the last few years, depart-
m e n t a l l e c t u r e s h a v e b e e n
organised by the biochemistry
department in response to the
s u g g e s t i o n b y t h e r e s e a r c h
councils ( M R C , S E R C etc) that
p o s t g r a d u a t e s s h o u l d receive
some k i n d of formal training
outwith their own specialised
research projects. That is to say
the research c o u n c i l s ( w h i c h
f u n d p o s t g r a d s ) are p u t t i n g
pressure on departments to have
p o s t g r a d s a t t e n d a d v a n c e d
lecture courses and seminars to
be formally examined on them.
The department therefore initi-
ated a series of lectures of which
six had to be attended (from a
choice (i not many more).
In the past, lectures were
organised without consultation
with the postgrads, were poorly
a t t e n d e d , often u n i n t e r e s t i n g
a n d h e a v i l y c r i t i c i s e d . T h e
postgrads' complaints were met
this year by the department's
offering to match the R C S U
support of the students' B i o -
c h e m i c a l S o c i e t y ; this w o u l d
e n a b l e the B i o c h e m S o c to
organise more lectures of greater
v a r i e t y a n d interest t h a n the
departmentally-organised ones.
This offer has been discussed by
this year's Biochem Soc c o m -
mittee a n d , a l t h o u g h it was
thought that more departmental
money should be made available,
we d e c i d e d to s u p p o r t t h e
arrangement on an experimental
basis for this year.
Yours faithfully

Dear Editor
T h e letter f r o m a l l o f the
officers of the Student Biochem-
ical Society, which I have seen
after they sent it to you on their
own initiative, is entirely correct
and represents accurately the
results of the friendly discussion
we have been having with them
o v e r a l o n g p e r i o d o n the
q u e s t i o n of lectures for o u r
postgraduate students. I need to
add two points not covered by
them, which I ask you to bring
to your readers' attention by
printing this letter with theirs.
Firstly, you relied extensively
o n an a r t i c l e i n the R C S U
Broadsheet, w h i c h was i t s e l f
w h o l l y i n a c c u r a t e . It is n o
defence for you to say that you
merely quoted another source,
since you appeared to state those
claims as facts, and since the
President of our Student B i o -
chemical Society, M r Tony L a i ,
told you on the telephone when
you enquired in advance that the
claims in the Broadsheet were
entirely mistaken. Y o u r article
has a p a r a g r a p h that negins
" T h e d e p a r t m e n t ' s d e f e n c e
is...", but no reporter asked in
advance either myself or other
academic staff concerned what
this " d e f e n c e " w a s , a n d the
s t a t e m e n t s p r i n t e d as t h a t
"defence" give a garbled version,
w i t h w h i c h t h i s d e p a r t m e n t
would not associate itself. I feel
that before printing a front page
a r t i c l e u n d e r a s e n s a t i o n a l
h e a d i n g a b o u t b e i n g " r i p p e d
o f f , you should have checked to
find that the story was false.
S e c o n d l y , the s t a t e m e n t s
made, apparently given as a fact,
that "for the last two years,
lectures arranged by the B i o -
c h e m i s t r y S o c i e t y w i t h f u n d s
from R C S U have been used as
part of postgraduates' examin-
a b l e c o u r s e " a n d t h e y a r e
"officially examined" on them
are false. It is correctly stated in
the letter f r o m the S o c i e t y ' s
officers that we did, for good
reason, put forward a scheme for
requiring our postgraduates to
attend six lectures. However, to
make it quite clear, I should
point out that we have never in
the past two years or at any
other time, put this into effect
f o r the l e c t u r e s f u n d e d b y
R C S U . I can state categorically
that no postgraduate has been
required to attend any of the
latter lectures, nor do we have
a n y a r r a n g e m e n t to c h e c k
whether they do so.
We did organise some of our
own lectures, without reference
to R C S U f u n d s , as we a r e
entitled to do. We have been
trying to bring our students into
the organisation of those that
will be required academically,
rather than dictate to them, and
I w o u l d h a v e t h o u g h t the
Students' U n i o n generally would
a p p l a u d this. W e have been

discussing a proposal for the
f u t u r e , b u t t h i s a t t e m p t at
s t u d e n t p a r t i c i p a t i o n is n o t
h e l p e d by u n f o u n d e d c l a i m s
a b o u t the past, a b o u t w h i c h
they, and I, are now complain-
ing.
Yours sincerely

From the President of R C S U
Dear Martin
In furtherance to your leading
article "We've been ripped off!"
in F E L I X no 626„ I write to
complain that the only people
that have been ripped off were
your readers.
Firstly, the article stated that
f o r the l a s t t w o y e a r s the
b i o c h e m i s t r y d e p a r t m e n t h a d
been using our U n i o n funds.
Fact: F o r the past two years
there have been proposals for a
joint venture in this area.
Secondly, it said that without
the c o m b i n e d f u n d i n g , the
s o c i e t y w o u l d h a v e h a d n o
money by Christmas. A g a i n , this
is grossly incorrect as will be
verified by either Chris B r u t o n ,
R C S U H J T or T o n y L a i , Presi-
dent of Biochem Soc. N o r has an
R C S U officer complained to me
about the quality of the lectures
a n d as for the m a t t e r b e i n g
discussed at General Committee
last M o n d a y , I was merely going
to make a statement endorsing a
decision taken at G e n C o m m on
M a r c h 23, which said "...This
w o u l d be a c c e p t a b l e i f the
s o c i e t y c a n s t i l l c h o o s e the
lectures freely," which is going
to be the case—the Biochem
dept are paying the Biochem Soc
for organising lectures of their
behalf.
A s it was, we did discuss it on
M o n d a y a n d the C o m m i t t e e
gave me permission to sign a
document to that effect, with a
few other conditions as well, one
of which includes a review of the
s i t u a t i o n at j o i n t G e n e r a l
Committee in M a y 1983, where a
decision shall be taken as to
w h e t h e r or not we ought to
extend the agreement. Yours
G E K Schmidt
R C S U President
A letter was also receivedfrom
Dr A Dickerson, Postgraduate
Tutor in the Biochemistry Depart-
ment, which echoed the views of
the three letters above. This letter
has been omitted, and Karl
Schmidt's letter slightly edited
(with the permission of their
respective senders) for reasons of
