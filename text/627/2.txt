ICU
New
Hon Sec
Three weeks after Mary Free-
man's resignation, I C U has a
new Honorary Secretary. Andy
Grimshaw was the only candi-
date for the post when nomina-
tion papers were taken down at
5:30pm last Friday, and was
duly ratified by the Elections
Committee.
Mr Grimshaw was (until Fri-
day) a third year zoologist, but he
has taken the post as a sabbatical
officer and so has interrupted his
studies until next year. He will
not be taking the room in Keogh
Hall that traditionally goes with
Andy Grimshaw - the New Hon Sec
the post, as he has already paid
his rent for a Head Tenancy this
term; instead he will be offered a
room next year.
Stephen Goulder informed
Tuesday's U G M of the appoint-
ment and wished M r Grimshaw
luck in his new appointment.
Beit
Burglary
There were three more thefts
from students' rooms last week,
all of them from Beit Hall, with
jewellery and personal posses-
sions being stolen. It is believed'
that the crimes were carried out
by a number of different people.
The rooms, all of which are
occupied by female students, are
in the old hostel. One, on the
first floor, was broken into last

cassette tapes were taken. Police
believe that the door was opened
with a credit card.
Two days later, between 8:45
and 9:30pm someone scaled a
drainpipe and climbed through a
window into another first floor

empty-handed.
Chief Security Officer Geoffrey
Reeves would like people who
saw anyone behaving suspicously
around Beit Hall last week to
contact him. He also outlined
the d i f f i c u l t i e s inherent in
maintaining security in Beit
Hall, which has badly fitting
doors and windows, numerous
fire escapes a n d drainpipes
which seem to be purpose-built
for cat-burglars. Security mea-
sures are at present being
improved.

wallet (presumably hoping to
find a cheque book inside) and
jewellry valued at £80, although
Hall insurances will only cover
£50 of this. Police officers did
not find any fingerprints, but
several footprints were left on
the windowsill and desk.
The fourth floor room, which
had a better quality lock, may
have been opened with a master-
key. The thief searched the desk

student of the biochemistry
student of biochemistry, parked
his car d i r e c t l y under the
windows of the departmental
library at half past ten. When he
returned an hour later, it was
gone and another vehicle was
parked in its place. He had
locked the car, which had an
integral steering immobiliser,

may have used a.key.
The car is a red Triumph 2000
saloon with a broad white stripe

investigating the case, and would
like anyone who was using the
library at about the time reported
and who saw someone tampering
with the car or driving it away to
come forward with information.
24 Hour
Rag
The Royal College of Science
Union has been granted a 24hr
street collecting licence by the
B o r o u g h of Kensington and
Chelsea. This was after they were
refused permission to stage Rag
stunts throughout London.
During the summer vacation,
R C S U officials applied to the
M e t r o p o l i t a n P o l i c e for a
warrant to raise money for
charity in the City of London.
After several months of delay
and i n d e c i s i o n , they were
informed on Tuesday morning
that their application had been
turned d o w n , but that they
might obtain a more local permit
if they were to approach the
Mayor of Kensington. As this is
none other than D r Brian Levitt
of the Chemistry department,
they had no difficulty in doing
this and on Wednesday morning
they were authorised to collect
for charity on Saturday Novem-
ber 20.
Having obtained the licence
the R C S intend to use it for the
full twenty-four hours, so they
will be distributing collecting
cans to teams of collectors from
11:00pm on Friday 19.
