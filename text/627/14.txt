City Carnival is definitely one of the highlights of the IC
social calendar. This year City and Guilds Union have
arranged for four rock bands (the Passions, the Go-
Betweens, the Questions and one other) a Jazz Band and a
Steel Band to play. In addition three films (Assault on
Precinct Thirteen, Rollerball, and Lemon Popsicle) will be
shown. There will be a bar until 4:00am, food, and fairground
stalls. So if you want a really good night out, the City
Carnival will provide it. Admission £4 in advance or £4.50 on
the door.
