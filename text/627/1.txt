OPENING TIME!
IC Union is to actively campaign
for more open bar accounts,
following a motion that was
c a r r i e d at T u e s d a y ' s U n i o n
General Meeting. The motion
also instructed the Union to
oppose the changes that would
allegedly weaken student repre-
sentation on the Bar Committee,
and to remove any I C U repre-
sentatives to the Refectory and
Bar Committee deemed not to be
representing the students' beliefs.
The motion stems from the
r e a c t i o n to R o y F r a n c i s ' s
removal from the Bar Subcom-
mittee where he held the post of
secretary. M r Francis, who had
Imade h i m s e l f u n p o p u l a r b y
'campaigning for a less secretive
attitude towards bar accounts,
was dismissed by the Academic
S t a f f A s s e m b l y w h i c h w a s
reviewing its representation on
various committees. The subse-
quent publicity in F E L I X over
the last two weeks created some
i n t e r e s t i n the m o t i o n , a n d
a l t h o u g h the m e e t i n g w a s
i n q u o r a t e , q u o r u m was n o t
called until after the vote.
C o l i n Cooper proposed the
motion, quoting verbatim long
extracts from the minutes of bar
committee meetings. In opposi-
tion, Stephen G o u l d e r (who is at
p r e s e n t the s u b c o m m i t t e e ' s
chairman) denounced the whole
motion as 'absolute fiction and
meaningful hogwash'. Heclaimed
t h a t so l o n g as he r e m a i n s
C h a i r m a n of the Ba r Committee
and is a l l o w e d t o see t h e
accounts, the Union's interests
are sufficiently well represented.

received for the post of U n i o n

were received. However, after an

boredom from N i c k Pyne, the
meeting refused to allow J o n
Barnett, the Welfare Officer, to
give his report.
