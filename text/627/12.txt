The first of the newly formed
men's Sth team matches is next
week.
Members should note that the
club has the use of two courts on
Friday evenings now. One word
o f w a r n i n g : c e r t a i n Sports
Centre staff show no sympathy
to players who cannot produce
both their membership card and
season ticket.
The Squash Club 'night out' is
on Thursday November 18 and
anyone is welcome to come
along—see Sports Centre (or
F E L I X ) for details.
Finally, the club has a number
of rackets for sale—see small
ads.

During the first week of the
summer vacation, the IC Water
Polo team flew out to Korula in
Yugoslavia for its annual tour.
We had only just arrived (or so it
seemed) when Steve threw up
and A l got the first legove.r.
During the week we ate a lot of
grilled food, tried to drink yards
of fizzy Yugoslav beer(?) and
played three matches all of
which were lost: 11-2, 13-7,12-2.
The first two were against Red
Star, Belgrade Juniors, and the
final match was versus the local
side who a c t u a l l y charged
spectators admission. We re-
turned to the rain of London
spending six hours in Zagrab
airport rest camp on the way
having had more than enough of
Yugoslavian airport officials.
M a n y thanks to Richard for
organising everything. This term
we have had two matches in the
Middlesex League, both against
Penguin 3. The first of these was
won 10-8 despite some very
scrappy play by almost everyone.
A week later however, Penguin
emerged with a much stronger
team to meet ours' which was
depleted due to absentees. We
lost the ensuing farce 10-2, but
we have since found that we
have won the league this year
anyway. Future events are the
U L U swimming competition on
N o v e m b e r 15 and the U L U
Water Polo knockout (which we
won last year). Anyone inter-
ested in playing polo or swim-
ming should come along to the
p o o l in Princes Gardens at
6:30pm on Mondays or Fridays.
Snooker
Three matches were played this
week. IC A team drew 6-6 with
the G & J Club in the Shipping
Companies LEague, Davis and
Jennings each winning two
frames to make up for the earlier
lapses by Hurford and Gaskill.,
. In the U L U League, Paul
Holt's powerful B team crushed
Q M C by four frames to one.
Star of the show as the semi-
paralytic Barry Franklin whose'
appearance attracted a larger
than average c r o w d . H o l t ,
Thomason and Powell won their
frames with some ease, but the
consistent Lawrence lost.
The C team was less successful
against the same Q M C oppo-
n e n t s , ~ w i t h o n l y G r i n d a l l
m a n a g i n g to win a frame.
However, there was an encour-
aging display from Gardener,
and Kenny Jarrett addeda bit of
c o l o u r to the o c c a s i o n , if
nothing else.
Finally, don't forget the Pot
Luck Doubles tournament this
Dunday, starting at 12:00 noon.
Also, entries are invited to the
open and handicap tournaments
—details in the Snooker Room.
New match-sec Gordon Bowser
experienced considerable diffi-
culties getting home since
someone had inconsiderably
built an exhibition hall in the
middle of the road. Last week
Mark Bourke spearheaded the
club's assault on the Browne-
M a r t i n trophy, the attempt
being thwarted by Gordon's
inability to count to ten. How-
ever Gordon is showing fine
progress with a new personal
best of 99. Jonathan's new hair
cut is the envy of the club—
where did he catch it from?
Tennis
IC vs Templars B 4-0
IC all stars played their first
winter league match last Friday
under floodlight at Templars
L T C . Transport courtesy of
Ralf's pus yellow tonka toy.
F i r s t p a i r R a l f D a u d a n d
Christian Langevin slaughtered
their first pair 6-0, 6-0, with
suprmeme style. The second pair
John Sear and Mike Shepherd
had a few problems with. the
i n i t i a l f o r e p l a y but p u l l e d
through to a fine performance 6-
4, 6-0.
C o n v i n c e d the h a l f - t i m e
d r i n k s had been l a c e d , I C
prepared to screw the opposition
into the ground. "I thought I'd
overcome my premature prob-
lem," said John referring to his
net play. Mike's serve seemed to
be going like a bullet 'til John
pointed out that it^was the
fireworks nearby. They defeated
the first pair 6-3, 6-4 and Ralf
and Chris somewhat incapaci-
tated by their orange squash
wokn 6-2 6-1.
Rifle & Pistol Q Hockey
The club editorial board apolo-
gise profoundly for the absence
of last week's epic literary
installment. Incidents unreported
include a tough shoulder-to-
shoulder match against Middle-
sex Hospitals, won narrowly by
1128 to 964. Star performances
included 197 from Noel and 195
from Geoff. Notable failures
,were Club Captain Steve Har-
rison (contact via the Elec Eng
letter-racks) who notched up
178, thus being eliminated again.
Afterwards the club held its first
ever bender featuring Tim and
Gary in a tight point-for-point
(first one to 40) competition.
G l a m o u r was added to the
occasion by the delectable Julia
who held Jonathan spellbound.
Firsts
Ding ding.
Round 1: Sharpe is starting
well with some good strikes to
the mid body. But the ogre is
fighting back and...yes. First
blood to him with a neat weave
and kick on the left knee, and
both ankles given 'the treat-
ment'. Imperial supporting well.
Dong dong.
Round 2: And Sharpe comes
straight out to the ogre with
another couple of ankle jobs (as
only he knows how) with a quick
need in the kidneys and stick in
the chest. But wait. A free hit to
Imperial and Sharpe really takes
advantage of this one. Ducking
and weaving round his opponent
who's resorted to swearing.
Apparently Sharpe's going to
'lose his block'. If he does that
again.
Ding ding.
Oh and did you see that!
S h a r p e u p e n d e d whilst the
umpire was looking the other
way. Not seen! Real aggression
as Imperial strike twice more:
and the Ogre's submitted.
IC vs Old Greightonians
It's been well over a year since
the first have won a Saturday
league game. However morale
was high as we left a quaint little
pub half a mile from the ground'
having administered Franklin
with his medicinal pre-match
G u i n n e s (or two). U n f o r t u -
nately the captain arrived late at
the ground and had to start the
game 'dry'—maybe there's still
hope for the firsts.
The ground was, as last year,
terrible but Imperial played well.
After a tentative start good
running at the midfield and
constructive use of the wings left
the 'cretins' on the receiving end
of many good moves although
the forwards failed to convert
many tok goals. Good defensive
work by Tony and Andy at the
back gave the team a good base
on which to build our game. A
handful of short corners were,
once again, wasted (we most
work on that), but Imperial
finished the game two deserved
goals ahead.
IC vs Middlesex Hosp 6-0
Another victory. What on earth
is g o i n g on? Last year we
struggled against them, and this
year...well four goals in the first
fifteen minutes squashed what
little pride they might have had,
with even Peter 'Rapier' Sharp
showing the potential for (dare I
say it) stick work.
They were large and deter-
mined but four swift attacks
from the initial whistle gave
Imperial two lousy goals and
two 'bunders'. We then eased off
allowing Middlesex more of the
possession although they never
looked like scoring. Imperial,
p l a y i n g a man s h o r t , were
w i t h o u t a right w i n g , but
Middlesex never capitalised on
this weakness and left right
midfield Bell the run of the
pitch. In the second half two
more goals were neatly slotted
by a bemused 'Sex' goalie
leaving a frustrated Middlesex
team.
Team: your favourites.
