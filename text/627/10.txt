[OPINIONI
This week's Soapbox is provided by Imperial
College Friends of Palestine, a newly formed
society about to become members of OSC. In
this article they outline their ideas on the
Palestine problem.
The Palestinian
Holocaust
The Need to Act
The outcome of the Israeli invasion o f Lebanon a n d the siege o f
Beirut has added another sad chapter to the long and never ending
strife between A r a b a n d Israeli. T h e Israeli venture, which was
originally launched under the false pretext of 'defending' Israeli
settlements i n the Galilee, began with the Israeli semi-destruction of
several towns a n d villages i n the South o f Lebanon (and the total
demolition of Palestinian refugee camps, such as E i n Hilweh south
west of Sidon), and led to the horrific siege of West Beirut and the
massacres at Sabra a n d Chalilla refugee camps. Israel has thereby
managed to successfully a d d to its long list o f malpractices a n d
breaches o f international law and the United Nations Charter (such
as annexing the G o l a n Heights, building more Jewish settlements o n
the occupied territories, refusing to award the prisoners of war status
to Palestinian prisoners a n d torturing them, enforcing collective
punishment e t c . ) . T h e measure o f materialistic destruction is
beyond description, with tens o f thousands o f civilians killed and
hundreds o f thousands made homeless.
P L O Peacemakers
Once again, the events i n the Lebanon have come out with a
strong and clear message about the need to find a solution to the
Palestinian question. Israel's approach towards solving the problem
is to ignore the rights o f the Palestinian people as has been reflected
in Israel's past a n d present policy ( G o l d a M e i r at one time denied
that the Palestinians existed. Begin and Sharon have come up with
an up-to-date version with the ridiculous claim that Jordan provides
a national home for the Palestinians.) Israel has to realise that
reconciliation is better than confrontation. U n l i k e the P L O who has
always sought towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, the
Israelis have c h o s e n to c o n t i n u e to i g n o r e the rights o f the
Palestinians a n d even directed a policy o f oppression against the
Palestinians in the West B a n k . I n 1974, the chairman of the executive
council of the P L O , Yasser Arafat, called for a n establishment of a
secular democractic state i n Palestine (Israel), where Arabs and
Jews could live i n peace side by side. M o s t Palestinians accepted
the idea of a secular state but sadly the Israelis rejected it. Later o n ,
the P L O s h o w e d f u r t h e r m o d e r a t i o n b y c o n t e m p l a t i n g the
. establishment of an independent Palestinian state i n the West Bank
and G a z a strip but Begin has recently referred to the West Bank as
"Western Eretz Israel" thus reviving the revisionist notion that the
historical land o f Israel also included the east bank o f the river
J o r d a n . It is encouraging though, to see that some Israelis such as the
'Peace N o w ' movement have spoken openly for Palestinian rights
a n d have opposed the extremist policies o f the Begin government. It
is o n this understanding that peace i n the M i d d l e East could be
achieved.
Israeli Torture Camps
M o s t Palestinians i n the Lebanon, of w h o m there are 237,000
refugees registered with the United Nations Relief a n d W o r k s
Agency ( U N R W A ) and probably as many again not registered, have
had their lives disrupted in one way or another in the recent fighting.
L i k e fellow Lebanese who had their homes destroyed, they are now
living in partially demolished buildings with as many as twelve
people living in one small bedroom in some cases. U N R W A is setting
up 13,000 tents to accommodate the huge number of homeless
people. This is however not to be thought of as a permanent situation
where everything has gone back to normal. The situation is very far
from n o r m a l and the problem o f Lebanon is even more complex than
it ever was before. A s for the Palestinians in Lebanon, they now find
themselvers under the mercy of Israel, w h o have detained almost
every male between the ages o f twelve a n d sixty-two at the Ansar
c o n c e n t r a t i o n c a m p i n t h e S o u t h . H o r r i f i c m e m o r i e s o f
concentration camps in the Second W o r l d W a r are now being
revived with the Israelis beating Palestinian prisoners to death and
using varied methods of torture.
Maronite Butchery-
The Israeli operation has been given A m e r i c a n blessings if not full
support right from the beginning. United Nations resolutions calling
upon Israel to withdraw from the Lebanon were initially vetoed by
the U S , who d i d not attempt to exert any kind of military nor
economic pressure o n Israel (the U S being Israel's main supplier of
military equipment and economic aid). A t a time when Israel was
besieging Beirut (and was using highly destructive weapons such as
cluster, phosphorus and vacuum bombs, in the small a n d highly
civilian populated area), the U S a n d a l l the Western press, were
calling upon the P L O to evacuate Beirut, as if the P L O were the
aggressors. T o prevent the Israelis from bombing Beirut until total
destruction, the P L O has agreed to be evacuated, doing so at the
risk o f leaving Palestinian w o m e n a n d children i n the camps
undefended. Everybody (some more than others though) came to
regret that, as the familiar nature o f Begin and his fascist allies rose
to the surface and the genocide at Sabra and Chatilla was committed.
The men who butchered the Palestinians in the camps were not a
r a n d o m b a n d o f mercenaries. A c c o r d i n g t o reports they were
members of an organised unit of the Lebanese Froces, the Maronite
militia built up by Bashir Gemayel with Israeli help and equipment.
Cooperation at a high level was proven to have existed between the
Lebanese Froces and the Israeli army who even provided flares to
illuminate the scene of the crime during the night. The massacres
were carried out i n order to cause the Palestinians to flee out o f
Lebanon. The same ruthless policy was carried out by Begin in 1948
at D e i r Yassin when the massacre there caused panic and led to the
mass exodus of Palestinians out o f Palestine. (This tied in very
conveniently with the Zionist aim of creating an exclusively Jewish
state i n Palestine).
Victims of Oppression
The facts and statistics mentioned above, and other facts which
have not been mentioned, depict the desperate need for positive
action. T h e Imperial College Friends of Palestine is a society,
c o m p r i s i n g Palestinian a n d n o n - P a l e s t i n i a n students, with the
objective o f promoting the understanding o f the facts about the
M i d d l e East problem. It aims towards introducing Palestinian
culture explaining the effect the diaspora has had on Palestinian way
of life a n d the emergence o f the P L O as a movement o f national
resistance. In its General Meeting, the society managed to attract a
large number of students who showed particular interest i n , and
regular enthusiasm for learning about the Palestinian question. T h e
society believes i n the right of the Palestinian people to live in
security ar.d i n peace within an independent state of their own. T h e
society also believes (in accordance with the belief o f the majority o f
Palestinians), that the P L O is the sole and legitimate representative
of the Palestinian people and that any solution to the conflict cannot
be a c h i e v e d w i t h o u t the active p a r t i c i p a t i o n o f t h e P L O as
representatives o f the Palestinian people. T h e society views with
great concern, the present and future condition of the victims of war
and o f oppression, and will participate in making more bearable the
tragedy to which they have been subjected.
