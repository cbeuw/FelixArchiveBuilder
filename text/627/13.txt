Cross Country
A s predictably as the seasons
pass t h r o u g h t h e i r e t e r n a l l y
changing phases, so once again
did the I C Cross C o u n t r y team
venture forth to distant G u i l d f o r d
in pursuit of a relay race.
W i t h the threat of a downpour
posed by clouds rolling across
hill and dale towards the course,
our two mens' and one ladies'
teams paused a while to consider
their task ahead—a three kilo-
metre sprint.
A n hour and six legs later and
everyone was back safely from
their ordeal. We finished some-
where in a field of many, and
past grievances were forgotten as
we tucked i n to our fodder.
M u c h the same thing hap-
pened on Wednesday at M i d d l e -
sex Polytechnic, except that the
distance was 8 k m , there were
more people and ten was no-
where to be found.
The next race with a ten is
ages yet but come along to the
B a t t e r s e a P a r k F r i e n d l y o n
Wednesday anyway.

I C vs Wye 1-8
A disappointing day out in the
country for the seven ladies that
bothered to turn up ended our so
far unbeaten run i n the league.
W e conceeded the game to
Wye College and opted to play
a friendly which turned out to
be quite enjoyable although I C
certainly missed the presence of
a couple of key players.
The 8-1 scoreline in Wye's
favour was really only a true
reflection of the fat that the
u m p i r e h a d n e v e r u m p i r e d
before in his life.
Thanks to those who did turn
up: A n n , Alice, R u t h , N a n d r i k a ,
Sara (1), K a r e n , Sara.
I C vs Q E C 8-1
A i m : D e f e a t i n g Q E C b y the
scoring of goals without con-
ceding any.
Method: Eleven I C ladies were
taken and added to eleven from
Q E C o n a h o c k e y p i t c h . A
catalyst (Sara?) was added to
a d d the e s s e n t i a l d r i v e a n d
e n t h u s i a s m r e q u i r e d f o r the
reaction to proceed.
The reaction proved to be very
exothermic and a lot of tension
and excitement was evolved. A s
the r e a c t i o n t i m e p r o c e e d e d
goals were scored by A l i s o n (3),
A l i s o n (2), K a r e n (2) and Sara.
Result: I C won 8-1.
C o n c l u s i o n : T h e r e a c t i o n
favoured the Imperial side and
the desired result was obtained.
Error: One goal was conceded
due to a defensive misunder-
standing. However this had little
effect on the.overall result.

I C vs Police no 2 A r e a 41-7
Saturday saw I C at home to a
rathe"r weak p o l i c e side. T h e
game started late due to the
police arriving four short (on
call up for Brixton) and thus
borrowing a few of our players.
The game itself was scrappy due
to no back-row and some niggle
i n the p a c k . E v e n t u a l l y I C
settled d o w n and ran the ball
w e l l , t h o u g h c o n c e n t r a t i o n
lacked at times and resulted in a
few dropped passes and missed
tackles. Despite this I C only
conceded one try, dubious at
that, and scored seven them-
selves. These were M Simmons
(2), P E d w a r d s , H i n m e r s , J
Boucher, D D o w n s , G Pike with
M Winsor getting five conver-
sions and one penalty.
Team: P Eastland, NBrummel,
M Simmons, G Pike, D Downs, J
Boucher, M S Winsor, M Naylor,

A n d y Page is now regretting his
s t a t e m e n t : " I ' l l j u m p off the
Queens Tower if we lose three
games." The rest of the team,
however, have guaranteed h i m a
trip to the top should he change
his mind.
A s y o u may gather, we came
second. It was close thoueh (2-
1). R i c k a r d scored. After the
long journey from Goldsmiths
the suicide squad, Dave D e a n ,
G r a h a m R i c k a r d , J o h n Burns,
and new member Paddy M c -
G u c k i n set about a circuit of the
C o v e n t G a r d e n p u b s . T h e
suicide squad was accompanied
by Britvic Boys A n d y and J o h n .
The latter pair had kept the rest
of the team (and the community
in general) on their toes with
s t r a t e g i c a l l y p l a c e d bangers. '

Whatever happened to the good
old days? Imperial winning the
first race by guile, luck and gear
failure, then go on and lose the
second race, and finally lose the
m a t c h i n a n e x c i t i n g 1-2-3
victory by the opposition. N o t
that I'm complaining, because,
a n d y o u m a y need to brace
yourselves for this information.
Imperial College Sailing Team
won their first league match of
the season. I mean won. A n d i n
the time it took U L 2 to decide
who was going to shout ' B A N G '
at the start.
This is not a l l , three teams
dared to challange the might of
I C , City (see above), Oxford and
Essex.
Oxford put up more of a fight
and won the second race of the
three race series, which consti-
tutes a match. B y this time it had
been deemed impractical to shout
start times on the water and the
'Le M a n s ' starting procedure
had been adopted, watches being
synchronised ten minutes before
the s t a r t — o n the j e t t y . T h i s
procedure lead to a fairer start
and in a close contest I C won the
f i n a l race a n d therefore the
match. Another feather in the I C
bobble hat.
T h i s left o n l y E s s e x to be
sailed. Problems, bad starts all
round which left the captain at
the b a c k , he t h e n , t o m a k e
matters worse, hit a mark and
was t h e n to be seen c i r c l i n g
aimlessly. In an amazing " Y o u
win this one and I'll go out and get
another o n e " manouevre. I n -
stead of, in the best traditions of
team racing, slowing d o w n the
o p p o s i t i o n ' s b o a t s , t h e r e b y
leaving the opposition i n fifth
a n d s i x t h p l a c e , t h e t e a m
successfully let the boats through,
leaving themselves in fifth and
sixth assuring the opposition of
fourth.
The second race ended i n a
win for I C and so the match was
not lost—until the third race.
A n o t h e r b a d s t a r t , a n d a n
opportunity missed due to lack
of experience i n a luffing match.
N o reproaches, the team is
still young and still managed to
win two of its three matches. It
was also a magnificant day for
s a i l i n g , t h e w i n d w a s n e a r
perfect, the r a c i n g was g o o d
natured and it all amounted to
an enjoyable day.
