ICLUBS & SOCIETIESI
Mines
Well, I hope that everyone has recovered from
the various parties etc last weekend. Don't
forget we're going to C a r d i f f t o m o r r o w
(coaches leave at about 8:45am outside RSM)
Cardiff take this match very seriously and
therefore we want to take as many people as
possible to show them what we're about.
A l s o please r e m e m b e r O p e n D a y o n
Monday. This is our one chance of the year to
impress employing companies a n d future
undergraduates. W e need help on Friday and
Sunday (to move stuff) and we want everyone
to act as a guide on Monday (free meal and
booze to all helpers). Please sign your name up
outside G20.
There is also a Bathrobe and Pyjama Party
in the J C R on Friday 19 (band and disco).
Dancing
A great chance to practice your steps. U C L
and City Dancing Clubs will also be coming to
make it a great social occasion.
There will be competitions through the
evening for beginners (waltz and chacha) and
for any students (waltz and jive) and open
(quickstep and rhumba).
These competitions are great fun to enter
however good you are, so get practising. Entry
for them by 7:30 on the day.
For those not competition minded, there
will be general dancing with spot prizes. There
will also be a demonstration couple to show us
all how to do it.
T h e date for y o u r diary is S a t u r d a y
November 20 at 7:00pm in the J C R . Tickets
available from all dancing classes.
Photosoc
Sometime next week, or perhaps the week
after, we a r e going to have s o m e new
laboratory type benches installed i n the
darkrooms. One for the old darkroom and two
for the new darkroom to replace the replicas of
the wreck of the Mary Rose we have down
there at the moment. W e will let you know
when these have arrived, because we will need
someone to help install them.
Our next lecture will be on December 3 at
6:00pm (somewhere in Physics) and is entitled
'The History of the Photographic Lens' by Dr
Speer.
Finally, the person or persons who stole the
'Goolies' posters from the darkrooms at the
end of last year should note that this regulation
still applies.
Mopsoc
It must always be remembered that Charles
Dodgson was a mathematician.
Charles Dodgson, for those ignorant enough
not to know, is better known as Lewis Carroll. It
is quite simple for instance to show that Won-
derland is in complex vector space (remember
the mushroom-induced transformations); the
white rabbit, naturally, being the square root of
minus one.
This is, however, only tenuously connected
to t h e f o r t h c o m i n g M O P S O C l e c t u r e :
'Through the Looking Glass', by D r Robert
Spear of the Physics Department here at
Imperial College. This lecture was recently
given at the Royal Institution, and was received
with much acclaim. It will be at 1:00pm on
Tuesday (t'will be forty-five hours after brillig),
in Physics L T 2 (no sundial being available).

With reference to a certain librarian and I Hate
Sex £1.95 to those of you hoping for a brief
glimpse of his/her coming to me to do a deal, it
has all been arranged through the internal
system. Only I know the true identity and alas,
I cannot be bought.
T o those of y o u waiting for copies of
Managers Guide to Information Technology
or This Is It by Eaton & Smithers £8.95, it is
now in stock.
If I may appeal to J Yaskey Esq to come and
make himself known to me, we have a small
matter of bouncing cheques to discuss. O n
October 22 he purchased items to value of
£23.25 a n d claimed his department was
Industrial Sociology (?). O n October 28, he
purchased items to value of £20.00 and he had
changed his department to Management
Science. If he has not appeared by m i d -
November, the matter will be handled by the
gentlemen of the Law. The outcome of this is
to ask that you all carry your cheque cards, so
we may note the number.

Wellsoc STOIC
A couple of people, it seems, just couldn't
handle the pressure of being a high flying, jet
setting Wellsoc Committee member. It is quite
understandable, after all once you decide to
stand for stewardship of the society you have
no life you can call your own. People are
c o n t i n u a l l y s t o p p i n g y o u i n the s t r e e t s ,
p e s t e r i n g y o u for a n a u t o g r a p h , insane
groupies lusting after your body, etc. Yes sir,
it's tough at the top.
But seriously, it can be very rewarding.
Many of you have enjoyed Wellsoc through its
lectures, but it can be even more fun if you
participate a little more. Y o u meet many
distinguished speakers and get to know a great
many lively and interesting people.
By its very definition the aims and objectives
of the society are vague and intangible, which
means it is not restricted in its activities.
People with imagination and a lively sense of
fun will get a lot out of the society.
Elections will be held at 7:00 Monday before
the film Doppelganger.

Dear I B A
A s a p r o s p e c t i v e a l t e r n a t i v e c h a n n e l ,
S T O I C promises that our transmissions will
not include any socially relevant material, such
as mentally handicapped people being sexually
assaulted by midgets (they're all too busy
behind the cameras) or films on the morals of
vivisection and factory farming (our production
team is far too squeamish).
Instead, we promise to provide entertain-
ment for IC students, w h o clearly aren't
interested in the above. News will be included,
but only to enable the audience to see how
good the rest of our programmes are (a sort of
high class commercial break).
We also give an undertaking to keep our
material politically unbiased. This will be easy
as our left-wing journalists (who are pretty ace
lads) will simply be trampled o n by those who
actually know how to edit videotape.
The biggest argument for giving S T O I C an
IBA franchise is that Southside can't receive
Channel 4 properly and even if they could, we
own the T V Lounge set and can turn it over to
S T O I C anyway.
Yours responsibly

While sneaking a cheese sandwich in the Lyon
Playfair Library behind the 'New Aquisitions'
shelf, it came to me! Concealing my mouth
with my hand, I glanced furtively around. Yes,
the place was full of them—students. O n
sudden inspriation I thought, 'They need
something to enliven their deadened lives, to
bring sparkle to those sad, dull eyes'. A n d so
was borne into the world
The SF Soc Quiz
It was reported in the New Scientist that one
of the huge stone slabs had fallen to the
ground revealing the following inscription:
. ' A B C D E F G A B H D I A J C D K L H A J H D M N O P M
N O P M N G M L C . So what does it mean?
Obvious! A n d a prize for the first correct
answer presented (on hands and knees) to the
President (grovel) in the Green Committee
Room on Thursday at 1:00pm.

Islamic
Peace be upon those who follow guidance,
who believe in G o d and His Messengers, and
affirm that there is no Diety who is worthy of
Worship except the O N E and who fear the
inevitable day of Account.
In the Islamic Society we try to create the
environment and facilities for people believing
in the above creed to put into practice the
Islamic Duties arising from the same. Thus we
have established regular prayers and the study
of the Koran, plus classes for those interested
in learning Arabic.
F o r f u r t h e r i n f o r m a t i o n r e g a r d i n g the
activities of the Islamic Society, contact either
Tippy C h e m U G letter-racks or Yassir on 2666
(a reminder that congregational prayers today
will be in the Great Hall, Sherfield).
