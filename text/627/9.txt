Dirty Linen
The s a d fact that eight out of every ten
youngsters who are put in detention in borstal
'training' centres are on the slippery slope to a
life of crime makes such institutions perennial
subjects for examination.
In Scrubbers, the director, Mia Zetterling,
attempts to do this through the eyes of the
inmates of a closed women's borstal: their
fears, their motivations.their reactions to the
alien environment they find themselves in. This
effect is enhanced by clever lighting of the
building interiors to give them a flat, lifeless
feel.
C o m p a r i s o n s are b o u n d to be made
between this film of a closed women's borstal
a n d Scrum, its n o t o r i o u s p r e d e c e s s o r
portraying the equivalent male institution. This
film is far less patronising to the audience and
more believable. In Scrubbers, the institution
is not run along mob lines with violence and
homosexual rape common occurrences while
the impotent authorities try to keep some
semblance of order. This film is compassionate
and at times humorous. Lesbianism a n d
violence do occur, but these are an undertone
to a study of c h a r a c t e r s under stress
attempting to get through their sentances. The
B B C ' s Porridge series would be a better
simile than Scum, although it never degener-
ates into sitcom humour.
It is this, probably unconscious, similarity
that is interesting. For an institution supposed
to be geared to the c o r r e c t i o n of t h e
delinquent youngster rather than the 'old lag',
the only training going on appeared to be for
prison. Just another penal dustbin for society's
dirty linen.
It is a pity that in the rush to make sanguine
points about penal reform, the poor old prison
warders or 'screws' get sadly neglected. They

are the personificiation of authority against
which the girls must unite. Were the screws to
show one streak of humanity, your feelings of
affection for a bunch of wildcats that most of
us would go a long distance out of our way to
avoid, would be lessened.
This affection is a credit to the convincing
acting of the whole cast, for the most of whom
this is their first film role. Chrissie Cotterill was
particularly fine as Annetta, a woman with a
rather overdeveloped maternal instinct and a
ipenchant for truck drivers. Amanda York also
mastered a difficult part as Carol, a complex
mixture of toughness and vulnerability.
The British Film Festival is on for the next
fortnight at the National Film Theatre (see last
weeks Walkabout Looksee for location) and is
well worth a visit. It includes many rare and
interesting films, as well as a posthumous
tribute to Werner Fassbinder showing many
films from his tragically short directing career.
