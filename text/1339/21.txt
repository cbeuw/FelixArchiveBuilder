On a cold Sunday morning, the IC
Football ladies set out for Harlington.
After a late arrival of Chin, aka cap-
tain Planet, the team walked out on
the frozen astro. All nine of us, as
one unreliable girl had not showed
up and another had cancelled last
minute. The players were, however,
ready for the clash against the 11
RUMS girls.
The game started as referee
Richie P
, aka Zippy, blew the whistle.
IC started strong, keeping the ball
mostly in the opponent’s half. Pav
and Yoke flew up their wings, help-
ing the midfield and, more occasion-
ally, dropping back to defend. The
opposition made few runs, and did
not worry Chloe and Jools much
in the centre and left Muna almost
bored between her goal posts. The
domination of the IC ladies during
the first half was impressive, despite
their low numbers. Half-time came
fast however, and honours even.
The second half began well as
the pitch started thawing. The IC
Ladies interpreted this as a good
omen as they walked back on. The
trio Mo, Chin and Poppy won the
ball, wherever it went, and sent it to
Liz further up, who shot it with her
powerful kick.
The ref finally started calling
the bad throw-ins of the opponent,
giving back the advantage to us
several times. The IC ladies truly
seemed to be everywhere on the
pitch. The defence was impenetra-
ble and gave RUMS great difficulty.
Their defence, however, seemed to
be leaking, allowing IC to perform
several shots on goal. After several
attempts, the ball finally touched
the back of the net, thanks to Chin.
She ran all the way up the pitch,
determined and as though nothing
could stop her and shot, leaving the
RUMS girls deeply disappointed as
the score became 1-0.
The game went on, but as time
passed by, the IC ladies started to
become tired. They still maintained
an excellent performance however,
letting RUMS come close to scoring
only once. For this one shot on goal,
Muna was however ready and saved
us all by plunging after the ball.
What a save! A badly called corner
almost gave the opposition another

Following promotion from division 3
of the Middlesex league last season,
Imperial Chess team is again coast-
ing in division 2 after an unbeat-
en start to the season. The best
moment so far was the demolition
of Ealing 2. Coming after a dis-
appointing draw away to an aver-
age Albany, our team was seriously
psyched up. IC’s shrewd captain,
Peter Levermore, carefully outlined
his inspired master plan: win every
game to thrash them 8-0.
Things started well, with Ealing
failing to put out a full team, imme-
diately forfeiting on last board to
put us one up. With their board 6
yet to show and strong positions
on all boards, confidence was high.
So high, in fact, that when Ealing’s
missing player finally did turn up, his
opposite number, Imperial’s Qingyui
Chen, turned down the option of an
automatic win before calmly crush-
ing his tardy opponent.
Violent victories from Moritz
Reuter and Ed Leung, and more
serene successes from Robin Nandi
and the skipper soon followed, leav-
ing us 7-0 up with just my board
left to finish. With team Imperial
impatient to get down to the pub,
my opponent’s obstinacy was frus-
trating, but despite my best efforts
it was only after 3 hours play that
my foe finally failed, and resigned
his tormented team to the inevita-
ble whitewash. No sympathy was
shown, however, and we duly turned
down ailing Ealing’s offer of drinks
together in favour of our own, more
gloat-orientated, drinking session.
Meanwhile, Imperial’s ULU team,
captained by Robin Nandi, is also
getting on well after kicking off the
season with a satisfying victory over
UCL. Thanks should go to all those
involved in the successful Imperial
Chess teams for what has been a
stunning start to the season. Look
out for a blitz tournament later this
term and the Mestel challenge in
January, where you get to take on
Imperial’s own Grand Master.
and 4th places (out of 6). After our
success, it went a little downhill as
the previous nights drinking began
to wear off, and Stew managed to T-
Bone another boat after an amusing
aim in front, aim behind, hit middle
sequence.
“we set off to show
the new members how
much fun it can be!”
Towards the end of the day, the
initial round robin was over and we
had managed to make it into the
Silver League, however the wind
had dropped and our final race of
the day involved the smallest course
possible. This meant that more
than the usual 90% of the race was
determined by the start, and our
starts were not improving. Then
disaster struck. Light faded before
we managed to start the second of
our final afternoon races, meaning
we would have to pack up the boats,
reducing the chance of having a hot
shower when we got back to the club
house. It also meant we would have
to rig the boats before our first race
in the morning at 9, making it an
even earlier start than on Saturday.
The Saturday evening is what the
Loughborough sailing competition
is known in the sailing calendar for,
and we were not disappointed. That
is until we had to get up in the morn-
On the 3rd and 4th December, the

Loughborough Laser Team Racing
Event 2005, where we competed
against 14 other teams. This year’s
team consisted of Islay Symonette,
Ian Preedy, Stew Edge, Helena
Hamlyn, Thomas Dormenval, and
(Captain) Tom Sibley, and although
we did not have much team racing
experience between us, we set off to
show the new members how much
fun it can be!
After an early briefing on the
Saturday, it was straight into racing.
The weather in the morning was
looking good, with a blustery wind
but showers on the horizon. Most of
the team were happy that they had
brought their dry suits with them;
the others were feeling the cold.
The first capsize happened within a
few seconds of leaving the shore, and
all spectators couldn’t stop laugh-
ing at them, even to the point that
another boat ended up in the water
too. During our first few races we
improved steadily, proving that the
best way to learn some sports is by
throwing yourselves into a competi-
tion (as the other teams had already
been to several competitions in the
last few weeks along with substan-
tial practice for the events).
Several races were led by our
boats, and the afternoon climaxed
with our first team win by having
our boats cross the line in 1st, 2nd,

opportunity, but the ball was rapidly
cleared. As the IC ladies continued
their struggle against exhaustion,
Richie P saved the situation as his
watch skipped a few minutes, allow-
ing the IC ladies to forgive him for
his doubtful corner. The game there-
fore ended in a happy atmosphere,
as the IC won once again. Special
thanks to Yoke’s parents who came
from Singapore to watch us (our
first international supporters) and
to the boyfriends, Garo and Tim,
who “willingly” came to cheer the IC
ladies on this cold morning.

ing for our incredibly early start.
(Our tactics from the Saturday of
doing the team race as a fleet race,
then possibly trying some team rac-
ing manoeuvres if necessary, had
not been working at the end of the
day. So we decided to stick with
them on Sunday.) We didn’t have
as many races on the Sunday, and
were finished by lunchtime. Our
final race was the best one we had
all weekend: the wind was very light,
and we managed some good starts.
The course was not as small as on
the Saturday, and we managed to
use some of the manoeuvres we
had learnt over the weekend. This
resulted in some fierce team racing,
with all boats finishing within a cou-
ple of boat lengths.
Unfortunately, we were just pipped
to the mark, but both teams agreed
that it was some of the most exciting
team racing we’d had that week-
end.
“a fantastic time,
and proving that we
were good sailors by
not capsizing once
throughout the whole
weekend”
After that, it was back to the
warmth, and a good laugh at those
who still had round robin races to
complete. We left with only a few
victories behind us, but after having
a fantastic time, and proving that
we were good sailors by not cap-
sizing once throughout the whole
weekend.
