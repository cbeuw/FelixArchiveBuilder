Next week, one of the most excit-
ing photographic exhibitions of the
year will close at the V&A. Diane
Arbus Revelations contains nearly
two hundred of her most important
and iconic photographs, and is the
biggest retrospective of her work
ever presented and has raised many
questions about the ethics of her
photography.
Arbus’ work is very unsettling to
view and at time even disturbing.
Obsessed with the idea of catalogu-
ing the people of New York, she
approached every social taboo
unashamed and apparently uncon-
cerned as to the effects of her pho-
tographs.
Her photos, though in ordinary
settings and of ordinary subjects,
are stark, cold and harsh on the eye.
Arbus somehow manages to make a
normal scene seem sinister. From
a young boy proudly displaying a
‘Bomb Hanoi’ badge to a peeping-
Tom style photo of naked women
sunbathing, each photo gives off the
feeling of something being wrong,
although it is not always easy to
pinpoint why.
Her subjects are varied and inter-
esting. The most interesting are of
the normal people she captured out
on the streets of New York.
These people are ordinary and
unimportant, but Arbus picks up
on the tiny details that make them

“Who killed the chicken guy?” is
a truly contemporary and experi-
mental play written by one angry
Welshman, two angry black men
and a black feminist. These are four
of the ordinary writers from the
Oval House Theatre, and with direc-
tor Karena Johnson, have presented
an incredibly intricate comedy.
The play is an ironic blend of pas-
sion, anger, tears and, above all
laughter. A humorous and mad brew
of death, politics, confused sexuality
and disdained love, fermenting in
the oppressive setting of a locked
apartment. The result is explosive
in every single sense of the word.
The play reflects London’s current
cultural variety, scratches the sur-
face, digs deeper, and tells us how
the past can come back to kick you
up the arse.
The action spins around the 15th
floor of a flat in South London where
a “bent” politician, an ambitious
journalist, a hopeless dad, and a
really disturbed bag lady find them-
selves trapped. This provides the
right environment for the plot to
develop, and the real nature of the
protagonists to come out of the clos-
et, and find out unimaginable things
about each other.
The structural design of the
Oval House Theatre provides an
exceptionally close and cosy set-
ting for the audience to get com-
pletely engulfed into the action. The
emotional connections between the
characters start as crazy separate
stories. However, they start con-
necting together and making sense
as the plot evolves, with a big twist
at the end.
The deranged bag lady is one of
the neighbours in the building. She
speaks an utterly crazy African lan-
guage and chants around the flat
Rafiki-style.
The play takes place in the jour-
nalist’s new flat, when her dad, a
womaniser electrician, comes to
install the electrical appliances. At
the same time, her work colleague,
who is actually her lover, is finding
major issues about the compatibility
of his political career and his rela-
tionship with the journalist.
Father-daughter issues, an ambi-
tious political career against rela-
tionship issues, sexual confusion,
all full of guilt and puzzlement, get
stirred revealing a very dark story
behind it all, making you cackle
throughout the entire play.
And in the end, who kills the chick-
en guy? The play is much more
complex than that; it talks about so
many different things. The question
becomes much deeper.

unique and exciting. She gives them
in their fullness and asks us to view
and judge what we see.
Apply for a grant, Arbus said of
her aims, “I want to photograph
the considerable ceremonies of our
present, because we tend, while liv-
ing here and now, to perceive only
what is random and barren and
formless about it...
“These are our symptoms and our
monuments. I want simply to save
them, for what is ceremonious and
curious and commonplace will be
legendary.”
These photographs tell as much
about Arbus herself as they do about
the subjects. Walking around the
exhibition, you get the feeling that
she was a very self-obsessed artist.
search of ‘freaks’ of society to pho-
tograph. Starting innocently enough
with oddities such as female imper-
sonators and fat naked women, she
progresses onto more controversial
subjects, as in The backwards man
in his hotel room, 1961.
The image is distressing, not only
because of its freak-show qualities,
and because it is such an intru-
sion of privacy, but also because of
her patronising attitude. She photo-
graphs the man haggard and tired,
facing away from the camera. In
doing so she is asking us to feel his
shame, and take pity on him.
Not stopping there, Arbus con-
tinued this trend by photographing
a group of people with mental dis-
abilities. Her Untitled series cap-
The one self-portrait in the collec-
tion, Self-portrait pregnant shows
her attempt to scrutinise herself in
the same way, but instead results in
a soft and dream-like photograph.
Indeed, Arbus’ obsession leads
her to disregard all propriety in
tures these people in such a gro-
tesque way, that it is hard to look at
them for a sustained period of time.
Although the scenes are apparently
of enjoyment, Arbus manages to put
on such an air of blunt monstrosity
that you cannot but help feel her
subjects are unwilling victims of a
pitiless mind.
However, it is certainly clear that
Arbus shaped our attitudes towards
photography drastically.
In her unrelenting attempt to
record the fringes of American soci-
ety, she has created a time warp; a
flawless but delicately cruel collec-
tion of images that at once inspire
and haunt the mind.
