Sagittarius (Nov 22nd – Dec 21st)
2006 gets off to a good
start but don’t forget
to slow down and take
time to enjoy it - else
you might end up
missing out on some
fun. Did I mention that you might
soon have bull on your hands? Silly
me.....
Capricorn (Dec 22nd – Jan 19th)
Things will perk up
this year, so grab life
by the horns and look
forward to some fun
and frolics with an
occasional pleasant
surprise.
Aquarius (Jan 20th – Feb 18th)
Did nobody mention
that 2005 was so last
year?! Stop living
in the past and look
forward to a busy year
with lots of new faces.
Pisces (Feb 19th – Mar 20th)
Take a few moments
to reflect upon the
many successes of
your last year before
you jump-start this
one. Remember - one
step at a time.
Aries (Mar 21st – Apr 20th)
Lady luck has always
been your friend but
it would be wise to
ask for her continued
blessings even if you
think you don’t need
it. The road ahead isn’t looking as
smooth as you might like.
Taurus (Apr 21st - May 21st)
How many of those
resolutions have you
managed to keep?
A few, I bet, as your
stubbornness (umm, I
mean determination)
means you’re much more likely to
see things through.
Gemini (May 22nd - Jun 21st)
This will be a some-
what make-or-break
year for you. Your
laid-back attitude may
have made you friends
but does little for you
at work. A little thought and you
may achieve more than expected.
Cancer (Jun 22nd – Jul 22nd)
You start 2006 fo-
cussed and in control
of matters, be sure
to maintain this
and you’ll reap the
rewards in more ways
than one. Don’t be timid now.
Leo (Jul 23rd – Aug 22nd)
Your social status
climbs high this
year, but be sure to
stay true to yourself.
Romantic offers may
come your way but
think before you act.
Virgo (Aug 23rd – Sep 22nd)
Time to take it easy
now, as this is the
beginning of the year.
You need to recharge
your batteries so you
can deal calmly with
situations which may tempt a blown
fuse.
Libra (Sep 23rd – Oct 22nd)
Life has its ups and
downs, and deals out
unexpected situa-
tions. This year could
see your experiences
change you for the
better, just maintain some perspec-
tive.
Scorpio (Oct 23rd - Nov 21st)
The dawn of the year
is barely broken and
already you have
regrets. You may want
another new start,
but regrets are so last
year! Don’t waste your precious
time, there’s so much for you to
enjoy.
Aw, bless...
Dear Miss C,
Two weeks ago I gave my
boyfriend a blowjob and swallowed
for the first time. Recently, my
stomach has been feeling a bit
strange and I have still not had my
period. My boyfriend says there is
nothing to worry about but I just
have to know - could I be pregnant?
Ms Take
Dear Ms Take,
Ok! Let me clear this up for you
once and for all! Having spoken to
my medical student friends, I can
confirm you cannot, let me repeat,
cannot get pregnant from oral sex!
Whether you’re pregnant from
another night or a split condom
or something, I dunno, but you
are definitely not pregnant from
swallowing! Now, it’s possible
that your stomach is feeling funny
because you’re allergic to semen
and are hence feeling a bit sick.
Doubtful, but if that’s the case, then
just spit next time - it’s acceptable.
Now, if you’re still feeling the need
for reassurance that you’re not
pregnant, go to the nearest Boots
or visit a doctor or the NHS walk-in
centre and get a pregnancy test,
but please, for your own sake, stop
telling people it’s because you
swallowed. People will laugh, in
a cute bless-her kind of way, but
laugh they will...
There goes another one...
Dear Miss C,
I lost my virginity not long ago
but ever since my first time, every
time I use a condom, it splits. I
have tried using x-tra strong but
it has made no difference. What
could be causing this to happen?
My friends say I have a funny
shaped knob. Could this be true?
Need Reassurance
Dear Needs Reassurance,
Ok, before this goes any further,
I need to stress I am a girl, and
obviously have no experience in
this area, but I will try my best.
Now, as I have never seen your
package, I can’t really comment on
you having a weird shaped knob.
You can send me a picture if you
want, but I can’t say I’m dying to
have a look, although it may provide
amusement for the Felix office.
Now, as to your query, I don’t think
you having a weird shaped knob
is the problem, unless of course
it’s the shape of a Christmas tree,
in which case - get yourself down
to the nearest urologist and see
if they can fix you before you do
some serious damage to one of
your partners. Why your mates
felt the need to look and analyse
does scare me slightly. Don’t give
me any of that shit about having to
look in the locker rooms, you really
don’t. Girls manage without, why
can’t you? My associates and I have
discussed your problem in detail in
order to find a possible explanation
and we suggest that you try a larger
sized, higher quality condom, or
search for alternative methods
of contraception, i.e. warn your
partner, as, if they are female, you
may end up with more than you
bargained for.
Where did all the balls go?
Dear Miss C,
A few nights ago I shagged a girl on
the pool table in my halls. I noticed
that there is a CCTV camera in
there and I was wondering if you
thought it would be acceptable to
ask if I could get the recording?
Ya Ma!!!
Dear Ya Ma!!!,
Mate, do you have a death wish?
Sending me that question when
there really is only one conceivable
answer? Well, this is good for
me, it lets me start off this new
year with a fully deserved rant
about the world of men! No, it is
not acceptable for you to ask for
that film and it’s obvious why,
although for someone with some
insane exhibitionist streak, I’m
surprised you even took the time
to ask. Before I totally lose the
plot of this question though, I have
a few questions for you. Why the
pool table? In the centre of the
common room? Are beds no longer
comfortable enough? I’m sure the
sofa would have been a bit easier
on her back! How on earth did you
get the girl to agree to that one?
Methinks someone slipped a bit of
Rohypnol into the eggnog! Now,
back to your initial question. I
really don’t approve of you asking
for the tape. But boys will be boys
and will want to gloat, and I’m sure
that tape will win you awe from the
other boys, but I doubt the security
men will return it to you. Now, as
much as I’d like to hope that the
tape has been erased, I live in the
real world, and it has probably been
put in the CCTV tapes Cupboard Of
Fame, and might possibly be on the
way to some candid camera show
such as idiotic drunken students,
or being posted on a porno site as
we speak. I hope you’re ready for
some publicity. Sheer decency says
you warn the girl, and mate, in the
future, 3 words – get a room!
Dear Miss Conﬁdentiality...
Happy new year! Hope you
enjoyed your Christmas break,
but just in case you didn’t enjoy
the family festive fun, remember
I’m here to answer all your
worries at agony.felix@ic.ac.uk.
I came back slightly disturbed
to find these 3 X-rated presents
in my inbox. Methinks some of
us defiantly enjoyed the festive
season and felt the need to share,
or, in some cases, gloat! Enjoy...
Miss C
