Naked Centrefold
The opening of Imperial’s new
Ethos sports centre has been hit by
further delays. The centre, which
will be largely free for all students
and staff, was originally scheduled
to open in October 2005. Last spring,
the Rector himself assured students
and staff that the new centre would
open on time and would not be sub-
ject to the building delays that have
plagued other College projects.
However, over the summer
the opening was postponed until
Monday 9 January. Felix was told
the Rector’s estimate had been
“too overambitious”. Students were
again assured that there would be
no further set-backs and gym and
swimming pool would be available
at the start of this term.
Nevertheless, the opening has
been put back an additional three
weeks until 30 January. Paddy
Jackman, Head of Commercial
Services told Felix that the delays
were the result of “problems in com- Leader, page 19

missioning systems”.
Students and staff were only given
three days notice of the postpone-
ment in a college-wide email sent on
Friday 6 January. It seems bizarre
that students weren’t given more
than one working day’s notice if
there are three weeks worth of
building work to be completed.
Sameena Misbahuddin, Union
President, described the delay as
“annoying, especially for students
who’ve cancelled their gym member-
ships ready for the opening... With
half the year already gone before
it opens, College should extend the
free gym and swim trial at the very
least, better still – keep it free on a
permanent basis. It is going to be
an excellent facility, when it finally
opens.”
Disgruntled student, George
Stephenson, told Felix “that at a
prestigious university like Imperial,
I expect honesty not lies and excus-
es”. Jackman told Felix that the
“severity of the problems was not
apparent until a walkaround inspec-
tion last Friday.” The centre will
now fully open on 30 January, rath-

The number of British minorities
studying at Imperial has been called
into question by Melanie Thody,
Head of the College’s Student
Recruitment Office. Thody stat-
ed that there is a “lack of British
minorities studying at Imperial”,
and told Felix that white middle
class students are over-dominate at
Imperial.
“Imperial select on ability. In
some faculties there are concerns
about how few white students there Leader, page 19

are. Jane Gibbs, our (Imperial’s)
Widening Participation Officer, has
said in some instances the white
working class male is in the minor-
ity,” said Thody.
The Guardian recently disclosed
figures from the Higher Education
Statistics Agency (HESA) which
it stated “reveal a deeply worry-
ing racial divide amongst British
universities”. The report singled
out Imperial as having very few
students of Afro-Caribbean origin.
Imperial has one of the highest pro-
portions of ethnic minorities (most-
ly international students), however
ally planned. However, the squash
courts have suffered more serious
problems and are not expected to
open until mid-February.
A quick tour of the facility reveals
a considerable amount of work still
needing to be completed. It’s hard to
imagine how the centre could ever
have opened early this week. Even
the pavement outside has yet to be
laid. Steve Howe, Assistant Director
of Estates, said “the pavement is
not essential for opening, and is the
responsibility of Westminster coun-
cil, who promised to complete the
work before Christmas”.
When it finally opens, Ethos will
be the only University sports centre
in the country to offer free workout
and swimming to students. The
£17.5m centre is part of Imperial’s
drive to reverse its reputation as
“not a university you want to go to
if you’re sporting”. The four-storey
centre houses a 25-metre swimming
pool, fitness gym, squash courts,
spa, sauna, sports hall, climbing
wall and a Costa Coffee shop.
