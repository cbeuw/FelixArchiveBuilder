A team of scientists in the UK has
developed a new technique that is
able to crystallize a wide range of
different proteins. They claim that
this method is possibly a major step
towards the “holy grail” of crystal-
lography – the development of a
single technique that would be able
to crystallize any given protein. The
discovery could significantly speed
up the development of new drugs
and treatments.
Proteins are usually present in
aqueous solutions, such as blood
or the gem of an egg, which makes
it impossible for scientists to probe
their chemical structure due to their
amorphous state. When crystallized
the proteins assume a solid three-
dimensional structure that can
be probed by shinning X-rays into
them. By knowing their structure,
biologist can tell what function the
protein performs in the machinery
of life.
However, the crystallization of
proteins usually results in tiny and
disordered crystals which perform
badly with X-ray crystallography
and techniques vary from protein
to protein, depending on its charac-
teristics such as electrical charge or
size. Therefore, scientists have been

by an equally sized pore present in
the material.
They tested the idea using

est number of proteins ever crystal-
lised using a single substance.

Scientist’s embryo cloning
faked
An investigation into the work
of discredited South Korean
cloning scientist Hwang Woo-
suk has found further fabri-
cations in his research. Dr
Hwang’s landmark claim to
have cloned human embryonic
stem cells was false, a uni-
versity panel concluded. But
the panel, which last month
rejected other research by
Dr Hwang, has accepted that
he did create the world’s first
cloned dog. Dr Hwang has
admitted errors, but claims
his work was sabotaged. State
prosecutors are now expected
to look into the case. bbcNews
Human bird flu spreads in
Turkey
Five new human cases of bird
flu have been confirmed in sev-
eral Turkish provinces, pushing
the number of people infected
up to 14, officials say. The
cases, identified as being of
the deadly H5N1 strain, mean
the virus is now present in the
east, north and centre of the
country. At least two Turkish
children have died, and cor-
respondents say fear is spread-
ing rapidly across the country.
Health experts say there is no
sign the virus is passing from
human to human.
The two siblings confirmed
to have died of bird flu in the
eastern town of Dogubeyazit
had close contact with poultry.
Tests are still being carried
out on their 11-year-old sister,
who also died, to see if she was
infected with H5N1. bbcNews
João Medeiros of 7. Of course, we can only say
that we have an universal technique
once we crystallised hundreds and
hundreds of proteins using this
technique. However, the fact is that
these proteins are all very different
– different charge, different size, dif-
ferent families of proteins – and that
is a great indication for the future.“
This discovery may have consid-
erable implications to the pharma-
ceutical industry. Since the advent
of the Genome Project that drug
design is mainly aimed at the pro-
teins encoded by the genes rath-
er than the genes themselves, for
instance trying to block the proteins
responsible for AIDS, or engineer
proteins in order to enhance their
particular function in the body. To
do that, scientists have been trying
to determine the structure of all
hundreds of thousands of proteins
in the human body. The new method
of protein crystallization may there-
fore prove to be the fast track solu-
tion to achieving this goal.
The developments are to be pat-
ented by Imperial Innovations, the
College’s technology-transfer spin-
off company. The new method of
crystallisation is likely to be very
popular and faster structural eluci-
dation will mean subsequent activi-
ties, such as drug development, can
be performed sooner.
Imperial’s Professor Simon
Donaldson, known for his work in
‘exotic’ 4-dimensional spaces, has
been awarded the King Faisal
International Prize for science.
The prize recognised Professor
Donaldson’s contributions to pure
mathematics which have been
instrumental in strengthening the
links between maths and physics
and have helped to formulate better
descriptions of the laws of matter at
the sub-nuclear level.
Professor Donaldson shares the
prize with fellow mathematician
Professor M S Narasimhan, an hon-
orary fellow at the Tata Institute
of Fundamental Research, India.
Each will be presented with a gold
medal and will share prize money
of USD200,000 at the ceremony in
February in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Professor Donaldson said:
“I deeply appreciate the honour of
this award and am humbled to join
the company of outstanding scien-
tists who have received it in previ-
ous years. It is a special pleasure to
share it with Professor Narasimhan,
since much of my research career
has been devoted to extending a line
of work begun by him in the 1960s.”
The King Faisal Foundation was
established in 1976 by the eight sons
of the late King Faisal ibn Abd Al
Aziz, a son of Saudi Arabia’s founder
and the Kingdom’s third monarch.
It is awarded annually to reward
and encourage outstanding
research. Other areas recognised
by the Foundation include medicine
and Arabic language and literature.
As the President of Imperial’s
Institute for Mathematical Sciences,
Professor Donaldson is now focused
on applying his mathematical exper-
tise to understanding and tackling
global scientific problems such as
climate change and disease. He
says:
“Mathematical ideas make a vital
and fundamental contribution to all
branches of science, and the input
from other sciences continually
enriches maths. The human genome
project, the control of infectious dis-
eases, the search for the unified
theories in physics and countless
other problems drive this many-fac-
eted interaction, and stimulate the
research of hundreds of mathemati-
cal scientists.”
Professor Donaldson is also the
recipient of a Field’s Medal (the
equivalent of a Nobel Prize in math-
ematics). Already in his second year
of graduate studies, he had proved
a result which stunned the math-
ematical community.
This result, together with the work
of Michael Freedman, implied that
there exist ‘exotic’ 4-dimensional
spaces which although equivalent
to ‘standard’ 4-dimensional space
in some fundamental way were nev-
ertheless structurally different. In
other words, 4-dimensional space
had more than one such ‘structure’,
a remarkable result which only
holds for 4 dimensions.
Professor Donaldson’s work is
also remarkable in that it reverses
the usual trend by using ideas from
physics to solve problems in pure
maths. He used instantons, special
solutions to the Yang-Mills equa-
tions, which are generalisations of
Maxwell’s electromagnetic equa-
tions, in order to study general prop-
erties of 4-dimensional space.
