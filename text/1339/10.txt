Rabbit, rabbit
Well, the first term has gone and
what a hoot that was. A few bits of
information first: nightlife will be
running every other week now, as
I am being a bit wanky and have
decided that evenings before exams
should be spent revising and not
going and getting minging. Don’t
quite know what the picture is
about, but it seemed like a good
idea at the time, along with biking
around London. It is very easy to
forget your bike helmet by the way,
it’s only when you realise your head
is colder than usual that you notice
it’s missing.
Since last issue, we had the holi-
day period, and all I can say is: God
bless Valium. I don’t think I could
have got through my time at home.
The big thing was New Year’s Eve,
the focus of this weeks nonsensical
ramblings.
Well, we have white rabbits, the
mad hatter and a giant toadstool,
Alice in Wonderland theme if you
hadn’t already guessed. I kid not; it
was a very interesting evening. The
review is my New Year’s Eve at
Pushca. More details in the review,
but first I have to make a few com-
ments about the general public’s
behaviour. At the time it seemed
like a good idea to get public trans-
port to King’s Cross dressed as
the white rabbit. I think it was the
effect of a bottle of champagne and
the fumes from the spray hair dye.
That stuff is very potent, I don’t rec-
ommend using it in a warm room
– you get a little bizarre to say the
least.
Oh yes, the public. Not only did
we get heckled and shouted at,
some random guy on the tube start-
ed taking pictures of us. I wouldn’t
have minded, but he didn’t even ask
and was trying to be sneaky about
it. I suppose we did ask for it when
I had white hair and white skin. Oh,
and the ears as well. I had to keep
those on, otherwise I just looked a
big randomer.
I hope everyone had a good time
during the festivities and hasn’t
turned to prescription medication
at the thought of coming back to
Imperial. If you have, I can recom-
mend a few, just drop an e-mail and
I will send you a list.

I can’t imagine those gloves stayed white all evening
“White rabbits, mad
hatters and a giant
toadstool”
Pushca:
Making plans for Alice
New Year’s Eve comes every year
and sometimes it’s good, sometimes
it’s a bit rubbish. This year I was
determined to have a good time.
Having never spent it in London, I
wasn’t sure what to do. I had heard
of Pushca through some randomer
covered in bodypaint. The thing with
Pushca is, it is essential to dress
up and get into the theme. This
time it was a dark take on Alice in
Wonderland.
Having spent a long time deliber-
ating about what to go as, I opted
for the White Rabbit and my friend
Trish decided on the Mad Hatter.
When you buy your tickets, they are
very adamant that you have to get
into the theme. If you do not they
will turn you away at the door, which
would prove a very expensive and
rubbish night. I apologise for my
lack of vocabulary, I think I killed
a few brain cells over the holiday
period.
Now, the evening started with
painting my whole upper body
white and trying to drink a bottle of
champagne. The really sad thing is
that you couldn’t tell the difference
between the make up and my skin
in some parts. I am that pale. I’ll tell
you something else I didn’t know:
that corsets are a lot harder to do
up than I thought; feet were put into
use as well.
Where did she hide that balloon?
The location of every Pushca
event is kept a secret until the last
minute, we didn’t find out until the
night. Once ready, we then travelled
by public transport to King’s Cross.
This was the one place where we
didn’t receive much heckling at all, I
suppose they’re used to all the hook-
ers, so a pair of Alice in Wonderland
characters doesn’t even register
with them. Trying to find the venue
was a bit of a nightmare, it was
round the back of Russel Square in
Mary Ward House.
I’m glad she was wearing pants
“Greeted by a
caterpillar on a giant
toadstool”
When we entered the venue, we
were greeted by a caterpillar on a
giant toadstool. She was a very nice
lady, she gave me a little kiss on
the cheek. The entrance hall was
absolutely rammed. The coat check
was stupidly in a tiny corridor. So,
of course, when everyone arrived
it was just a huge jam of people in
various forms of undress, and that
was just the start.
Instead of buying drinks, we had
to buy tokens from different charac-
ters near the bars. For New Year’s
Eve, the drink prices weren’t too
obscene, but they weren’t cheap by
any means, but when your bar staff
are as hot as they were, you don’t
mind paying a little bit more. A rule
for future nights out, attractive bar
staff = high drink prices.
She ended up getting tied up

There were several rooms play-
ing a huge range of music. I haven’t
been to a party where there was
such a huge range. Each room was
different but each DJ in each room
played completely different sets.
Each room also had a different
theme; from a garden wonderland
to a tea party.
What was nice to see was that all
the crowd had made such an effort,
there wasn’t one person who had just
turned up with no effort. Some had
tried slightly harder than the others,
to be fair. This one gentleman came
dressed as the Cheshire cat, I had
to keep running out of the room as
soon as he entered as he looked so
disturbing. It was like those evil cats
you see in horror films.
One of the best costumes, I have
to say, was the woman in full 16th
century garb including big wig. How
she danced, I do not know, she must
have been sweating her tits off. She
was going for it though. In fact,
there wasn’t a single person who
wasn’t enjoying every minute of
the evening. The amount of people
I just found myself talking to was
unbelievable, and everyone was so
friendly. I guess this may have had
something to do with the amount of
chemicals in their systems but still,
they were all great.
She was such a lovely lady
Where is my pint for that shelf?
“She should get a
doctor to take a look
at that”
At 11.30pm the most bizarre stage
show started. It involved a naked
woman covered in gold glitter and
a woman with a rabbit head grind-
ing metal on her crotch. It looked
like one of the craziest STI’s I’ve
ever seen. She should get a doctor
to take a look at that. The gold lady
was a whole different ball game,
she proceeded to finger herself on
stage, bend over, pull a gold balloon
out of her arse, matching darling,
and blow it up. She then popped it
over the crowd covering the first few
rows with glitter. Nice.
Anyhow, that was my evening, I
hope you enjoyed it.
