Yes, Prime Minister! - Whilst in the PM’s chair I pressed a big red but-
ton on his phone, alarms went off. I hope I didn’t declare war.
Kuwait: is it all about oil?
This Christmas, nine British students swapped cold England for sunny Kuwait
T
o say people were sur-
prised when I told them I
was going to Kuwait this
Christmas would be the
understatement of the
year. The general reaction I got was
why? “Why on earth are you going
there?”, “Why would you want to go
there?”. When we were disembark-
ing from the plane, the steward-
ess asked where we were going.
“Kuwait” I replied. “Aren’t you con-
necting to anywhere else?”.
The Kuwaiti Government and
Kuwait University wanted to send
British students to foster rela-
tions between the two countries.
Hundreds of Kuwaiti students come
to study in Britain every year, but
the travel has definitely been one-
way until now.
I like to think of myself, perhaps
without justification, as a somewhat
knowledgeable kind of guy, but my
knowledge of Kuwait was woefully
inadequate. Jot down all the facts
you know about Kuwait. I came up
with the following;
.It has a lot of Oil
.It’s small, in the desert and next
door to Iraq
.The 1991 Gulf War was fought
between Kuwait and Iraq
.It’s quite a wealthy country
Family members I told about the
trip seemed to have an even more
limited knowledge than me. My
Gran said, “Well I guess it would
be good to see it for yourself, they
can’t all be terrorists”. It’s this
sort of misinformed view that the
Kuwait Government is desperate to
reverse.
Recent events and the media’s
portrayal of them have tarred the
whole of the Middle East (and Islam)
with the same brush. Although there
obviously are similarities between
the Middle Eastern countries, there
are also many stark differences.
Though I knew Kuwait was a mod-
ern Middle Eastern country and had
been told to expect a “mini-Dubai”,
I was still shocked by the degree of
Westerness. The first meal we had
was KFC.
We were met at the airport by a
fantastic group of Kuwait University
students who were going to guide us
around their country for the week.
Before leaving, I had been contem-
plating what to wear. I wasn’t really
sure if the lazy-arse standard jeans
and T-shirt (polo neck for some-
where smart) would be appropriate.
At least I’m not a girl. Jenni, a genet-
icist from Cardiff Uni had specially
gone shopping to buy long-sleeved
and long-skirted “granny clothes”
only to be met by our three guides
Dalal, Shahad and Zamzam, who
looked like they had just stepped
out of the pages of a UK style maga-
zine.
Zamzam, who chose to wear the
khamir, still had a contemporary
ahead-of-her-time Covent Garden
fashionista style. The attitude of the
girls was also a lot more Western-
orientated than I had been expect-
ing, they were a cool bunch. I guess
all young people have the same

You will spend
87407.6 hours
at work during your life.
Ever thought about how you could
make them count?
If you thought working for peace, social justice
or the environment was something you only did
in a gap year, think again.
Picture yourself developing renewable energy
sources for communities in the developing
world. Or working with government to improve
public transport networks. Imagine setting up a
social enterprise, re-investing your profits in the
local community.
The Ethical Careers Exhibition will take place on
1st February in the Great Hall. We’ll be
showcasing a huge range of viable, challenging
careers like these in the public, private, non-
profit and academic sectors, along with
practical information and advice on how to get
started on your ethical career. See the website
for more details, and watch this space.
