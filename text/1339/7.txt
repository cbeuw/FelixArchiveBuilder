Woody Allen:
From the silver screen to a stage
near you. Huh?!
W
oody Allen? Heard
of him? I’m sure you
have. He has done it
all, from directing,
writing, to even act-
ing. He did not just revolutionise
the world of romantic comedy with
Annie Hall, brought the world to its
knees from laughter with Sleeper
and created perhaps box-office
defying beauty in Manhattan. He
taught the world to find laughter in
neuroticism.
Two-time Academy Award winner,
and obviously millionaire (despite
the slightly screwed-up family life),
he obviously hasn’t had enough
victories yet. For the first time in
theatre history, Woody Allen’s short
stories have been adapted into a
play entitled ‘Woody Allen’s Murder
Mysteries’. And no, you don’t have
to bleed out of your sockets to pay
for the tickets (like you would have
at the West End theatres). Being a
student, you can get a ticket for less
than 10 pounds at the Warehouse
Theatre in East Croydon. Hooray!
Now, here’s the scoop. The play
is set in the 1940’s New York state
of mind, which is just rife with sex,
seduction and scandal. The lead of
the story is Kaiser Lupowitz. The
first mystery of the night is a search
for proof of the existence of God.
And in detective stories like these,
there is always the busty, short-
skirted blonde, Lucy. Oh god, such
a bore isn’t it? You go for a play and
you expect a detective story but you
get a religious diatribe.
Hold it right there. As with all
Woody Allen stories, the key is to
not take it too seriously. The play
is hilarious and entertaining, to say
the least. Led by a stellar cast, who
do not just act, sing and dance, they
play a multitude of musical instru-
ments as well. Perfectly suited to
a cosy theatre such as Warehouse
Theatre, prepare to be touched
by the nostalgic rendition of love
between Kaiser and his secretary
and to be tickled by the extreme
shallowness of Mendel, who visits
his dying friend in the hospital to
meet the hot new nurse.
Being a big fan of jazz and the
blues, I was absolutely wowed by the
fantastic music and saxophone-play-
ing. And if you are a fan of jazz, you’ll
fall in love with the raspy, husky voic-
es and the almost-dull but captivat-
ing monologue of Kaiser Lupowitz.
So was it a successful transition,
you ask, from movie screen to real
life acting? Put it this way, I’ve seen
a lot of high-end musicals and plays
but this was the only one that almost
brought me to tears. Enjoy!

Jarhead: Touch down to reality
I
t is rare to find a war movie
aimed at depicting the real-
istic details of a soldier’s life.
Jarhead, an exception to the
rule, aims to tell the real-life
story of former U.S. marine Anthony
Swofford (“Swoff”), based in Saudi
Arabia in the days leading up to and
including Operation Desert Storm.
If you live with the idealistic notion
that war is about honour and glory,
this movie might just change your
mind.
Unlike other war movies, there
is no obvious political agenda as
the movie neither supports war nor
condemns it. Instead, Jarhead is
just a story of a marine, not some
super-soldier who manages to defy
all laws of common sense to miracu-
lously survive unscathed in a major
battle. The movie starts off light
with the minor trials Swoff endures
in enlisting but the realism strikes
you in the first 30 minutes after a
recruit is shot and killed in a train-
ing accident.
However, there are some breath-
taking scenes that give the view-
ers a break from the treacheries of
Desert Storm, such as when Swoff
takes a break from digging a grave
for a deceased Kuwaiti amongst
all the burning oil fields and has a
chat with Staff Sgt Sykes (Jamie
Foxx), and when Swoff meets an
oil-drenched horse amidst the same
oil fields.
Swoff and his fellow marines are
initially excited when they are sent
to Saudi Arabia. However, excite-
ment quickly turns into boredom as
they wait to enter Kuwait to fight
the Iraqis. The marines even start to
show signs of eccentricity and insan-
ity, such as when Swoff threatens
and almost shoots another marine
when the latter gets Swoff into trou-
ble, or when Troy, Swoff’s sniper
partner, almost loses his mind when
an officer deprives him of a chance
to assassinate an Iraqi high ranking
officer.
Though there are a couple of
scenes where we see the marines
cleaning and aiming their rifles, not a
single shot was fired by the marines
in the whole movie (until they cel-
ebrate the end of the war), which
is another reason that makes this
your atypical war movie. However,
director Sam Mendes still manages
to make Jarhead one of the best war
movies around. Despite the eccen-
tricities of the marines during their
days in the desert, the foul language
used, and the less than subtle hint
that the marines are obviously sexu-
ally deprived, Jarhead is definitely a
movie worth watching, and it may
even change your impression of sol-
diers in the armed forces.
Daryl and I have both gone
through 2 years of military train-
ing in Singapore before we entered
university. The movie was a realistic
summary of our own experiences
and we both felt for the characters.
