Flights of Fancy
books.felix@imperial.ac.uk
My two pence: If you need to read
something feel-good, you could do
a lot worse – the world is an inter-
esting idea and it is original. Any
Martin fan should avoid this as
it is nowhere near as good as his
later works.
As I wander back into the sea
of unremitting unpredictability and
confusion that is Imperial College,
I can’t help but wonder where it
was that I had last felt this way.
Was it some drunk encounter left
over from my scholarly days at IC
or some other drunk encounter
during my days of convalescence
(from too much drinking). No, dear
readers, this sense of déjà vu, elu-
sive yet persistent, has a far more
poignant origin. Fans of the Fantasy
style is a mere shadow here and
his characterisation and depth is
non-existent, meaning also that he
fails to make the reader care for
his characters as he can in other
books. Not for lack of trying, I might
hasten to add, as it’s quite obvious
that Martin is attempting tricks to
put across all these feelings – but to
someone who’s more accustomed
to the polished style and poise of his
later books, he fails miserably.
“If I had never heard
of Martin before, I
might have enjoyed
this novel...”
There’s nothing specifically poor
or even sub-par about Martin’s
novel – the idea is very original,
the plot is water tight, the writing
is intelligent and the whole story
plays together perfectly. So why am

genre amongst you will recognise
the name George R R Martin as one
of its heavyweights, and the majority
of you will be familiar with his hard-
hitting, explosive writing in A Song
of Ice and Fire. This novel, then,
penned by the same author, can
be assumed to be the same mix of
story, action and pace that has made
Martin such a huge success – or so
one may be forgiven for thinking.
This stand-alone novel shows us
Martin flexing his creative muscle
for the first time as he ventures into
the realms of storytelling earlier on
in his career. The simple story of
a girl with a dream to rise above
her station dictated by society is
weaved into an epic battle of wills
in a fictional world. Ultimately, a
feel-good story in a Fantasy wrap-
per, this novel is quite blatantly a
stab at writing from someone who
is inexperienced and still feeling his
way forward. Fans of Martin’s other
works will be dismayed to discover
that the hard and fast pace of his
books
I condemning it? Let me just put it
this way – to someone who’s tried
Pralines and Cream, Vanilla will
never be good enough. I have seen
Martin at his best and to witness
this piece of work next to them sim-
ply makes it pale in comparison.
Which brings me to my final point
– if I had never heard of Martin
before this novel came to me, I
might well have enjoyed it. So I’m
perfectly happy to recommend this
to anyone who’s never heard of
Martin before. And, if you happen
to be a fan, take this book out only
if you wish to see Martin practising
for the future, as there’s very little
else here for you.
As this novel stands, it is far from
perfect, and yet Martin’s skill, tal-
ent and, above all, imagination are
evident even early on in his career.
And, stacked alongside other stand-
alone novels by rival authors, this
work still stands head and shoul-
ders above the rest.
and would therefore stay at home
and revise. Yes, Miss Delaney has
been living in tracksuit bottoms for
the first two weeks of the Christmas
holidays. However, in the last week
this changed when I emerged from
my room to buy a few birthday
presents for friends. After nearly
5 hours, I bought enough to clothe
a small island (some items I don’t
think even the local charity shop
would want) but failed to buy any
presents. Alas, I may have to go back
into town and go shopping again. At
least I get some exercise.
Beauty for men has always been
a taboo subject. Well, just in the
company of straight men that is. But
are men’s moisturisers any different
to women’s? Although I frequently
borrow my boyfriend’s cream (it’s
Nivea for Men, nothing gay about it
I’m told) I always wonder if my face
will be covered in thick facial hair
the next morning.

As I write this article, I have just con-
sumed three packets of mince pies.
Consequently, I’m feeling decidedly
fat and disgusting. My mother has
a bad habit of buying in threes;
now as there are three members in
my household, a complete parental
unit and myself, it seems logical
that three packets of mince pies are
adequate. However, my father is a
Diabetic and my mother doesn’t like
sweet foods.

Shopping of course!

nounced effect on the skin,” says
Clinique dermatologist Dr David
Orentreich. “They make it stronger
by improving or enlarging the mid-
dle layer of the skin, the dermis,
with collagen. Also, the epidermis
tends to be thicker. Men’s skin is
oilier though, because male hor-
mones turn on oil glands.” But
aremen’s moisturisers any differ-
ent to women’s? “The basic con-
cept of cleansing, exfoliating and
moisturising twice a day is just as
important for men. In fact most men
will find that their shaving routing
improves when they start cleansing
and exfoliating regularly.” So that’s
a no then.
Here’s something that I thought
would amuse you while sitting in
lectures. No it’s nothing to do with
fashion.
The following was asked on a
University of Washington chemistry
mid-term:
Bonus question: Is Hell exother-
mic or endothermic?
Answer: First, we need to know
how the mass of Hell is changing in
time. So we need to know the rate
that souls are moving in and the rate
they are leaving. I think that we can
safely assume that once a soul gets
to Hell, it will not leave.
Some of the religions in the world
today state, that if you are not a
member, you will go to Hell. Since
there are more than one of these
and since people do not belong to
more than one religion, we can
project that all souls will go to Hell.
With the current birth and death
rates, we can expect the number to
increase exponentially.
Boyle’s law states that in order
for the temperature and pressure
in Hell to stay the same, the volume
of Hell has to expand as souls are
added. This gives two possibilities:
1 If Hell is expanding at a slower
rate than the rate at which souls
enter Hell, then the temperature
and pressure in Hell will increase
until all Hell breaks loose.
2 Of course, if Hell is expanding
at a rate faster than the increase of
souls in Hell, then the temperature
and pressure will drop until Hell
freezes over.
So which is it? If we accept the
postulate given to me by one Ms
Teresa Banyan during my freshman
year that “...it will be a cold day in
Hell before I sleep with you”, and
take into the fact that I still have
not succeeded in having sexual rela-
tions with her, then #2 cannot be
true, and thus I am sure that Hell is
exothermic and will not freeze.
The student received the only A
given.
