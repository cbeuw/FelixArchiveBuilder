avoid any added sugar. Alcohol can
be limited to one glass with a meal if
not following the diet strictly.
Next week we’ll focus on energy
boosting foods and foods that help
your concentration.
If, like me, you love your food, but
would rather pay someone else to
cook, then going out to restaurants
is a must. But, have you ever won-
dered what it’s like to dine out at a
renowned restaurant?
After watching Jamie Oliver strug-
gle to teach fifteen disillusioned
youths to cook, get a life and work
as a team, I decided that this was a
place that had to be seen.
You have to book your table several
months in advance, but, depending
on what you have, the prices can be
reasonable. For £25 you can have a
3-course set lunch menu.
The staff were very pleasant and
Jamie had even signed some bot-
tles of olive oil (£10 each) which you
could buy - my mum was extremely
impressed this Christmas!
The purpose of Fifteen is to inspire
disadvantaged young people to
believe that they can create for
themselves a career in the restau-
rant business. The restaurant has
had thirty-seven young people grad-
uate and many of them are now
working full-time in some of the
world’s best restaurants. It is now
three years since Channel Four’s
show, ‘Jamie’s Kitchen’, followed the
trials and tribulations of Jamie’s
attempts to open a restaurant and
create chances for young people. It
has been thirty six months of tre-
mendous ups and downs. Fifteen is
now supporting their fourth group
of young people - all of them unem-
ployed when first recruited, many
of them homeless or in care, oth-
ers living with learning difficulties.
All profits from Fifteen go to the
Fifteen Foundation (the charity for-
merly known as Cheeky Chops), to
provide these young people with the
working environment in which to
expand their knowledge and practi-
cal experience.
“Students at Fifteen do a 14 month
course, which costs about £18,000
and includes work placement at res-
taurants and sourcing trips abroad.
In the words of Vicky Sharpe, London
PA Restaurant Review:
“A restaurant certainly worthy of a
visit to sample simple but delicious
food and service that is slick and
unpretentious”.

increases in insulin have actually
now been shown to encourage the
body to burn fat.
Each plate of food you have should
roughly be made up of 1/4 low GI
carbs, 1/4 low GI protein and 1/2 veg-
etables or salad. You shouldn’t feel
hungry between each meal because
hunger pangs should be curbed by
steady blood glucose levels, but if
you do feel peckish, tuck into some
fruit or a low GI snack in the morn-
ing and afternoon.

A
s we’ve once again sur-
vived the indulgent fes-
tive season, it’s time for
new gym memberships
to soar and fad diets to
be taken up, only to be dropped
after a few months. Forget about the
Atkin’s diet, eating according to your
blood group or laxatives; everyone
now agrees GI is the way forward.
There’s no faddy theories involved;
simply basic nutritional theory. Not
only will it help you lose a kilo a
week when followed strictly, but will
help you maintain a constant healthy
weight without being a burden if you
want to follow it loosely.
The plan basically involves eating
foods with a low glycaemic index,
which are high in complex carbohy-
drates. These provide natural, slow-
ly released energy after each meal,
meaning your blood sugar levels
stay steady. Foods rich in glucose,
on the other hand, cause a surge
in blood sugar levels and subse-
quent insulin levels which remove
glucose from the blood. This leaves
you feeling lethargic, hungry and
craving another glucose hit. Low
GI foods will instead cause steady
rises in glucose, leading to a small
and gentle increase in insulin. Small
The festive season has taken its toll on the nation’s waistlines. Make a New Year’s resolution
you can keep – lose weight, banish tiredness and boost your energy with the G.I. diet.
