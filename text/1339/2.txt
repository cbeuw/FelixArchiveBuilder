Imperial and the Science Museum
have resolved a long-running dis-
pute over the Science Museum’s
collection in the central library.
The future of the museum’s col-
lection had been uncertain since it
transpired that College had raised
the rent payable by the museum to
affordable levels (Felix 1317).
Under the terms of a new agree-
ment, announced on 16 December,
the Science Museum Library’s most
important and frequently used items
will remain within Imperial’s Central
Library in South Kensington. The
less frequently used items, including
some periodicals held jointly with
Imperial, will move to a newly creat-
ed library repository at the Science
Museum’s site in Wroughton, near
Swindon, Wiltshire. The materials
stored there will be made available
to users in the Central Library with-
in 24 hours using a “modern docu-
ment delivery system”.
Imperial College plans to redevel-
op a large part of the existing library
building to provide upgraded stu-
dent study facilities with improved
access to digital library materials.
There will also be a separate room
within the Science Museum where
researchers can consult special-
ist Science Museum archives and
library material. The three locations
will be electronically connected to
ensure efficient management.
Implementation of the proposal
begins this month and is likely to
take around two years to complete.
The process will include refurbish-
ment of the library at Imperial,
increasing study space for students
and using digital and wireless tech-
nology to improve the learning
environment. Parts of the Science
Museum’s Wroughton site will also
be refurbished to meet its new role.
The agreement is supported by the
Rector, the Chairman of the Science
Museum and by the Department
for Culture, Media and Sport, the
Science Museum’s major funding
body.
See the Union President’s column
on page 16 for further details.

Noisy students face eviction
Imperial Islamic Society’s ‘Islam
Awareness Fortnight’ (IAF) begins
on Monday 16 January. The Islamic
Society believe that through aware-
ness and understanding they can
create better relations, develop tol-
erance, respect and harmony in our
society as well as promote better
cross-cultural understandings on
the Imperial campus.
During the coming two weeks, the
Islamic Society will host a series of
seminars with opportunities for you
to bring questions and have them
answered.
It will kick off with an exhibition
and a grand, festive bazaar pre-
senting art, food and culture from
various Muslim countries across the
world. Where else can you pick up
‘samosa’ and ‘falafel’ for lunch at
Imperial for free!?
Next, there will be a talk on ‘What
does it mean to be Muslim?’ and
‘What is Islam?’ Hot topics with the
Muslim perspectives are to follow
in our talks on the medical ethics of
cloning and the equality of men and
women in Islam, which many of you
have requested as a topic of discus-
sion. Is it really the case that women
in the Muslim world are oppressed?
How are women viewed in Islam?
To all you scientists out there
(practically all of you!), they will
be addressing whether science sup-
ports the existence of God. Does
science provide any evidence?
Last but certainly not least, the
week will close with a discussion on
‘sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll’, and a
general discussion on the social cul-
tures that we find here in Britain.
Seminars will be held in the
Sir Alexander Fleming building,
Lecture Theatre 2 at 5:15pm. Also,
please come and explore the exhibi-
tions on Mondays and Wednesdays
between 12 and 2pm on the walkway.
Please contact us for further details
(islam@imperial.ac.uk).
The coming fortnight will present
a fantastic opportunity to learn some
of the more questioned aspects
of this rapidly growing way of life.
Express yourself! Let Imperial know
what’s on your mind! Come and get
your questions answered and see if
it’s all you expected it to be. It will
be an excellent chance to meet new
people. Hope to see you there!

This Week
A new action plan to be passed by
Tony Blair could result in excessive-
ly noisy students being evicted from
their home for up to three months.
Eviction can only be enforced with a
court order, and would be reserved
as a “last resort” for the more seri-
ous offenders, which includes drunk
students shouting or listening to
loud music, said the government.
Part of Tony Blair’s “respect agen-
da”, the action plan would also give
police constables the power to fine
lawbreakers on-the-spot, as pros-
ecution is costly both in terms of
money as well as time. The new
plan would mean offenders can be
fined immediately without the need
to waste resources on prosecution,
thereby helping to curb small crimes
that can often go unpunished.
Despite the fact that the action
plan is not solely aimed at students,
it seems the effect on us will be
profound. Many-a-time fellow hall-
mates have gotten off with warnings
after a drunken night out. What fun
is drinking without the customary
ranting on the way home? Does this
mean there is a chance we will wake
up in the morning not only with a
hangover, but also out in the cold
with a fine to pay?
