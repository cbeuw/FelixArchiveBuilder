yJoshing! Ahem, only kidding. But
my, my, my, it’s been a while, hasn’t
it friends? Especially considering
the cock up with the final issue of
2005. Sigh. Nope, we didn’t really
think the Hicks review was so good
you should read it again, there was a
boo-boo somewhere along the pro-
duction line; my apologies. Get your
microscope out and you should be
able to read it slap-bang in the
middle of this page. Basically, it
consisted of a Teachers Series 4
review, which will be back next
week, and an extreme rant on
Lost, which will also probably
be back next week because
the finale is tomorrow! Er, of
course I mean, the finale is
yesterday! No, no, the finale
w[Shut up – Editor].
The actual festive period
was a bit crap for telly, but
either side has been superb.
Probably a good thing, considering
we were all playing Trivial Pursuit
or winning Monopoly in my case; it’s
all about the browns. Space Cadets
landed shortly before the Christmas
holidays. Taking reality TV to new
extremes, Channel 4 conned a col-
lection of people into believing they
would be the first UK “space tour-
ists”. Johnny Vaughan was perfect-
ly cast as presenter, with comedy
improvisation harking back to his
funniest days on The Big Breakfast.
The cadets were carefully selected
simpletons but still, the creators

W
ait for it! Wait for it...
When my girl Sky Mangel
Gave her titties a little jangle
I cracked my fat
My load was spat
And it ended in a court hearing,
followed by a lifelong restraining
order.
G’day you old bastards! I’ve been
as busy as a one-legged bloke in
an arse kicking contest, over the
merry season. That show pony Paul
Robinson knows what I’m on about.
Any Joe Blow will tell you, if you’re
going to live with a Sheila on drugs,
Rohypnol is the good oil. His daugh-
ter knows how to slip pills into a
drink too.
Now, let’s get to the duck’s guts!
Erinsborough’s becoming a danger-
ous place, with the robbery at the
bikini shop and some galah holding
up the servo. I reckon some good
old neighbourhood watch is in order;
make the punks feel like pork chops
at a bar mitzvah.
I bet that Timmons bunch is
involved, seeing as they ain’t got
brass razoo. Janelle thinks she’s in
Playdays, bringing up a family on a
tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk
had a tough job on their hands. For
these lucky, lucky people space was
squeezed into an abandoned airbase
in silent Suffolk. After some educa-
tion, some bullshit, some training
and a bit more bullshit, the cadets
were sent to a shuttle simulator.
Despite correct suspicions and near
revelations, the mission was a suc-
cess.
Channel 4 pitched the show per-
fectly; building suspense with
every episode. So much effort was
ploughed into it and the stooges were
hilarious. Russian crew commander
Yevgeny, a.k.a. Alex Humes should
be given the Best Actor Oscar
next month; one clas-
sic line: “If
y o u
meet space slug,
it will mate with you, you w i l l
make beautiful babies.” Moral issues
were called into question though.
Was the hoax too unkind on the “cos-
monauts”? Blasting into space is an
adventure few experience. The illu-
sion was meticulously and convinc-
ingly constructed. I felt part of the
gang, in on the joke; then the cadets
“saw” Earth and I felt very guilty
indeed. Channel 4 argued they still
felt the thrill of seeing Earth, even if
it was false. I’d agree to some extent
but the feeling of humiliation and
disappointment would probably rule.
£25k on the other hand – fair enough
to me! However, Space Cadets was
the next step towards more extreme
reality TV; caution needs to be taken
otherwise execution, not eviction,
will be voted for. Blimey, 400 words
gone, just like that. Excellent show
though.
Christmas came and went,
making way for 2006. New series
Balderdash and Piffle began
last week. The BBC asks viewers
to find out the earliest origins of
phrases and words. Some blonde
woman also goes around investigat-
ing, correcting the stubborn diction-
ary writers that their “ploughman’s
lunch” definition is ten years out
of date. Trust me though; it
was more interesting than I
do it justice!
Invasion started on Sunday;
another American, mega-
budget, 20-million episode
long series. It was pretty good.
Coming across as a less serious
X-Files, a show I loved; it should
fill the sci-fi void created when
Lost finishes. Thankfully, Invasion
doesn’t trudge along stuck in the
sand like Lost and the excitement
is continued through the episodes!
Huff. Huff! Save it for next week
Tomo.
Finally, Celebrity Big Brother
began last week. Another wonder-
ful show set to consume the 9 to 10
slot. The lowdown: Jodie is a moron
trying to prove she is not a slapper,
unsuccessfully. She just confirms
media speculation. Pete Burns: “I
don’t try to look like a woman, I just
have no choice.” Whatever, moron.
Galloway is likeable by me. Rodman
equals womaniser. Maggot to win!
Oh no! I just realised I forgot
Derren Brown: The Heist. Quickly,
before I’m dragged back into the
cupboard! Another fantastic show
but… please… forgive me master
Derren, I’m not... worthy! Vote…
Jo… die! Byeeeee!

Christmas TV!
bus. Bloody gippos will be the ruin
of the area.
Don’t even mention the yellow
belly duo. Stone the crows! Davey
boy couldn’t even tap along to the
White Stripes. And turning down
my $800 Scotch, he’s becoming a
religious fairy like his old man.
Although I see some tough times
ahead for the bloke, so a bit of faith
is grouse.
Now before I crash and burn, I’ll
leave you with the words of a true
blue, “Come on you cunt, lets have
some Aphex acid!”

Strewth!

Teachers - Series 4 (Cert. 15)
HHHHI
B lah, blah…
sod the
attempted witty
intro.
Lost was especially shit
last week. It was crap
the
week before so I
omitted it, but it was so awful last
week I must write about it.
Hurley was under the
micro-
scope. A microscope constructed
on Jupiter or something, but that’s
beside the point. It turns out Hurley
won the
lottery back in America
and has since been jinxed. Back
on the island, he is eager to find
the “French chick”. Hurley sheds a
few tons in the process as he walks
with intent to find her. He locates
her but, oh. Suddenly she’s a nice,
understanding woman who pours
her heart out to him. No savagery or
torture, she just tells how the win-
ning lottery numbers were the rea-
son her ship ended up on the island
and why her whole crew died. Great,
so there goes any excitement of find-
ing anyone else on the island? The
foreign transmission was due to her
too, no surprise there. But that’s my
beef; the episode was so uninspiring,
��
A s a pupil, you
have pre-
conceptions that teach-
ers are blank, with little
or no personality; they
don’t have lives outside
of their sorry, underpaid exist-
ence. Teachers are almost robotic
machines that operate Monday to
Friday, 8 till 6. They only know how to
shout and strike their red ball-points
in a crossing motion, or stroke in an
“F” motion if they’re the US model.
Once the end of school bell has rung
they return from bus duty, in single
file of course, to their corner of the
staff room and mark books. After
sticking down the very occasional
golden star, they walk on the left
hand side of the corridors to their
store-cupboard and power down for
the night.
Going out, smoking and drinking
aretreatsreservedfortherarelunch
down the
local on teacher train-
ing days, but not for the teachers
of Summerdown Comprehensive. A
new term and a merger with anoth-
er school means the
old tobacco
chimneys:
fatty Lindsay,
blonde
sex-pot Penny and “fucking fucker”
Bob are joined smoking in the bogs
by new recruits. Ewan is likeable,
handsome and gullible; Ben is a
neurotic RE teacher but “not a fuck-
ing Christian” and Damian is a sar-
castic loser. This bunch of booze
guzzling twenty-somethings are far
from the Demon Headmaster. They
walk through corridors swearing
like troopers, whilst in the
back-
ground little Bobby, little Freddy
and tiny Timmy are all getting the
shit kicked out of them. School is lit-
erally a riot for these kids. Children
fight with medieval swords and
another set of pupils even fire off a
military mortar! But, if there was
a school award
for most childish
member, the teachers would win it
every time here.
At Summerdown, the bell is cer-
tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk
is it worth watching the rest. Finally,
something was revealed but it was
like expecting Family Guy DVD for
Chrimble and actually unwrapping
King Of The Hill: “Uh, oh… ohhh:
well, I s’pose it’ll be good”.
To top it off, the creators decided to
show the numbers were also on the
side of Locke’s mysterious hatch.
Of course! Er… what the
fuck?!
How random and tenuous a link is
that! It’s like the pilled up writers
have been making this shit up as
the series progressed. God knows
what’s in the hatch. Well, I doubt
even He does. Maybe we’ll find out
that it’s a gateway to another dimen-
sion, or better still everything is just
a dream!
What also pisses me off is all the
interesting story lines that have just
disappeared. Why did Ethan kidnap
Clare? Why did that man warn Clare
she mustn’t have the baby? What
about the polar bears? How come
Locke knew about Clare’s birthday
and Walt burning the
raft? What
about Walt’s gift? Fair enough to
keep the suspense, but are
these
ever going
to be resolved? The
writers will have to cram them in
and I can envisage the
final epi-
sodes being horribly overblown. The
entire series could easily have been
halved. Lost was exciting, but the
pacing has been terrible. Maybe
Hurley’s bad luck affected the script
too? Whatever, this program needs a
miracle to save it.

G ’day you old bastards!
I’ve been as busy as a
one legged bloke in an
arse kicking contest,
this week. But I still got
time to read the Felix. All I’m saying
is, Dongo Geraldes you lairy galah,
get off the grass. Another bad word
against neighbours
and I’ll make
you
feel like a pork chop in a bar
mitzvah.
Now let’s get to the duck’s guts!
Any Joe Blow will tell you, a kiddy
fiddlers place in society is down the
morgue. The doc’s been a bonza
bloke ever seen I’ve known him, but
if the quack touched my Sky I’d cut
off his balls and feed ’em back to him
through his nose. But I don’t like to
go berko at a bloke before I know
the good acid, so fair go. Plus that
Timmons bunch are ones to tell a
porky. Gippo’s on the herb I bet!
Talking
about junkies, Izzie’s
got herself into a load of cactus.
Handcuffed on the counter of the
Scarlet Bar; cripes! But that’s exact-
ly what she wanted, especially by a
spunky young cop
like Stu Parker.
Just imagine
the
‘Basic Instinct’
moment down the cop station.
Now I’ll tell you whose not putting
on a good show; the yellow belly duo.
Stone the crows! Dave Bishop needs
that tuba stuffed up his fat date. Talk
about brown sound.
With all that racket going off, and
Lou’s new punk rock lifestyle, all I
can say is ‘Rave on!’ Or I the words
of a true blue, “Come on you cunt,
lets have some Aphex acid!”

tainly a signal for the teacher, not
the pupils; a signal for them to rush
to the
bar at ‘The Orange Tree’.
Here, they rip the piss out of each
other, constantly. Lindsay is “not
pregnant, just fat!”; Bob has applied
for a Thai bride on the
internet;
Ben becomes obsessed
with OAPs
and there’s gay awareness week
in which head teacher Claire tries
to discover “what exactly is it that
Lesbian’s do”. It’s good to see Claire
has survived
from previous years.
Cod-eyed Carol’s clapping signals
Claire’s entry into the staff room:
“Shut the fuck up” she announces
to begin the new term. No changing
the
ice-queen then. Carol, on the
other hand, has turned into an even
angrier, twisted version of Golum.
She grunts abuse at people, sprays
disinfectant on old people’s seats
and particularly hates lesbians.
The old cast is still excellent and
the new faces fit in pretty well too.
But, I couldn’t help feel that the
creators were using Ewan, Damian
and Ben to replace Simon, Kurt and
Brian from earlier series. Damian
and Ben are the idiots, several cans
short of a six pack each, and Ewan is
the attractive, slightly sharper pen-
cil in the draw. This is a harder task
than getting away with insulting a
French teacher by calling her “une
salope”, to her face. Still, Teachers
is still as stylishly edited and well
scripted as ever, sharp and funny.
