The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, has
been awarded a two and a half year
extension in his post. Imperial
College Council is “unanimous in
its appreciation of the Rector’s
achievements for the College during
the past five years” and have agreed
to extend his term until the Summer
of 2008.
Sir Richard was initially appoint-
ed Rector in January 2001, retain-
ing his famed chairmanship of
GlaxoSmithKline until early 2002.
Since starting at Imperial, his
actions have brought considerable
controversy, including the rebrand-
ing and streamlining of Imperial
College, his stance on top-up fees
and instigation of the College dress
code. Throughout Sir Richard’s
term, Imperial has retained a pos-
tion in the upper echelons of uni-
versity league tables. Recently the
Sutton Trust report placed Imperial
above Oxford University as the sec-
ond best UK institution.
Union President, Sameena
Misbahuddin, told Felix, “In my
opinion, with the College Centenary
approaching, and new projects being
embarked on in Wye, it’s obvious
College feel it’s best to extend the
Rector’s contract.”
Meurig Thomas, a third year
Rector’s term extended
Materials Engineering Student, told
Felix “I think he’s done a good job.
Like anyone though, he’s not per-
fect. Yes, there have been some con-
troversies and he’s geared Imperial
to be acting more like a business
than a traditional university - as far
as research is concerned, the lec-
turers and academics act more like
consultants.
For the students, gone are the days
when you can go into a Lecturer’s
office and ask for advice. They seem
to be bogged down in their own
research and personal targets and
the focus has shifted away from
undergraduate to postgraduate stu-
dents. Sir Richard is obviously a
very ambitious person and he’s got
plans for the place but I think it’s
important for him not to lose sight of
Imperial’s traditional strengths.”
Oliver Todd, a fourth year Medical
Student, didn’t have quite such a
pleasant account of Sir Richard’s
achievements, “We’ve tasted the
legacy - every penny sucked out of
undergraduate teaching whilst cool
pin-stripes in vacuous glass houses
scheme the new Imperialism and
it’s global domination. The dream
goes on, Sykes’ dream. And let’s be
frank, there was never any choice.
Sykes will stay. Forever.” It’s appar-
ent, at least to students such as
Todd, that Sir Richard’s success
comes at a price.
In the words of Bloc Party; “Two
more years, there’s only two more
years”.

Only 15 Afro-Caribbean students at IC
Imperial College have decided to
update and revise the controversial
dress code after drawing complaints
and protests from students, fear-
ing it would violate their rights on
campus.
The new revised dress code states
that students are no longer required
to have their College ID card on
display around the neck at all times,
and clarified its position on hoodies
and Hijabs, explicitly pointing out
that these are also not banned; how-
ever it has not reversed its decision
against offensive dress.
Part of the revision of the college
dress code states that “At all times
while on campus staff, students and
visitors must be able to present
their ID card for inspection”, whilst
noting that it is no longer a require-
ment that the ID card should be
worn around the neck, but instead
suggesting that “In most circum-
stances it is recommended that the
card is visibly on display, for exam-
ple clipped to a waistband or breast
pocket, or worn on a lanyard”.
After the furore that erupted over
misleading newspaper reports sug-
gested that Hijabs and other reli-
gious dress was banned, the revised
dress code goes to great pains to
point out that this is not the case,
stating that “The wearing of items
arising from particular cultural/ reli-
gious norms (including…hijabs…)
is seen as part of this welcome
diversity”.
The dress code continues to state
that anything that covers a persons
face (except for obvious health and
safety reasons) is not allowable, but
points out that hoodies and scarves
can still be worn, but not in such a
way so as to “not promote effective
security”.
The College’s position on offen-
sive dress remains, the wearing of
“obscene, racist, sexist or sectarian”
slogans “can result in a disciplinary
offence”.
The reversal has come as a shock
to some students. “I’m surprised at
the news, since [the original code]
was never really enforced” said
Owen Parsons, first year physicist.

What Not To Wear! Imperial’s verision of Trinny and Susannah won’t like you wearing a scarf, hoodie or “offensive clothing” (left).
You could be escourted off campus if you don’t wear your swipe card around your neck (right). Imperial plc, here we come.
Imperial College have announced a
strict dress code for its students and
staff. Failure to comply could result
in students being “removed from
the College’s premises”.
The dress code states that “at all
times while on campus staff and stu-
dents must wear their College iden-
tity cards”. On top of this employees
and students are told to “refrain
from wearing clothing that obscures
the face such as a full or half veil,
hooded tops or scarves worn across
the face”. The rationale behind
this is that it will “maximise our
[College’s] chances of detecting the
presence of anyone who shouldn’t
be here”. According to Imperial, this
dress code has been implemented
“in light of security concerns raised
by the terrorist incidents which
occurred over the summer”.
The ruling appears to be quite
unenforceable as there are numer-
ous entrances to the College, and
there is a public right of way straight
through the middle of College along
Imperial College Road, connecting
Queens Gate to Exhibition Road.
It is clear that College also have
doubts about the enforceability of
the ruling. An Imperial spokesper-
son told Felix, “It’s not a question
of it being enforceable – rather it
is a question of College security.
We expect all students to take their

dress code was a success!
(CRE) and Imperial Alumnus, said
“This survey gives new meaning to
institutionalised racism” and it is
“beyond doubt” that segregation is
taking place between universities
in Britain.
Thody referred to the comments
made by Trevor Phillips as “naive”
and said “it’s a simple fact of life
at the moment that some of these
minorities who’ve been talked about
are not making the grade at second-
ary school; it’s not that we’re refus-
ing them.”
Michael Bajomo, Vice President of
the Imperial College Union’s African
Caribbean Society (ACS), criticised
the figures provided by HESA. He
Continued from page 1 told Felix that the ACS had over 300
members; although they weren’t all
of Afro-Caribbean decent, he said he
knew more than 15 students person-
ally. He questioned the validity of the
UCAS-derived statistics as students
are under no obligation to declare
their ethnic origin when applying to
university.
He believes the real problem
at Imperial is the “lack of British
minorities” and believes there is a
predominance of white middle class
students. “The number of black
British students at Imperial must
be in single figures” he continued.
Imperial seriously considers wid-
ening participation, some staff are
recruited with the sole purpose of
raising aspirations and conduct-
ing mock interviews with under-
represented groups. Lindi Galloway,
Imperial’s Director of Access, said,
“Our strategy is to reach as many
people as possible, particularly from
non-traditional areas including peo-
ple who are not used to applying,
to show them what’s on offer and
help raise aspirations. It has been
highly effective in terms of gain-
ing applications from students who
might never have come to Imperial.
We’ve been working on it solidly for
six years and are starting to see
the first students come through the
system.”
Controversially, Cambridge
University has introduced a positive
discrimination quota system in an
attempt to widen access to minority
groups. Thody told Felix, “Imperial
College have not operated quotas,
that was a very high level decision.
It’s quite a dangerous game to get
into; Cambridge and LSE have been
doing it. LSE have been secret-
ly playing with quotas, in certain
areas they’ve taken a lot of black
students.” She assured Felix that
at Imperial, admissions are based
solely on ability and are open to all.
There is some leeway at Imperial
in the hands of admissions tutors,
“Supposing you’ve got a straight
‘A’ student from Winchester and a
student from a poorly performing
school with ABB both going for the
same place, then it’s really up to the
admissions tutor to make that deci-
sion. There’s a very good chance
that the latter will be given a fair
opportunity. But I don’t think it’s
reasonable to say it will always go
in favour of the poorly performing
school,” said Thody.
Galloway believes the “problem
is in secondary education” and that
“we can do nothing about it. We lose
large amounts of particular groups
because they give up on their own
secondary education at a very early
stage.” The government have set
targets for Careers Advisers in
school, notably for low achievers, so
there is no longer such a focus on
widening particpation.
The last word from Galloway,
“unless the government increases
funding, the Rector will increase
international recruitment.”
Imperial’s student executives have
given the go-ahead to fund a charity
concert organised by students at
the College. The concert, known as
MedXstock, hopes to raise public
awareness and educate others on
the issues of HIV and AIDS.
Two years ago, I came up with the
concept to organise an annual out-
door concert to raise awareness and
funds for HIV worldwide, in particu-
lar - Africa. It has taken this long to
finally get the message out. Due to
the recent LIVE 8 concerts staged
around the world, when our voice
was heavily muted, it felt that now
is an appropriate time to restart
the campaign. MedXstock is associ-
ated with the International Student
Imperial students organise 20,000 people AIDS concert
field reaching 400,000 young people
each year at an annual cost of just
£5 per child. Communicating life
saving information will bring about
improved livelihoods for young peo-
Imperial students aim to emulate Bob Geldof and Live8
Shiv Chopra ple including lower HIV infection
rates and better health outcomes.
The event will be headlined by sev-
eral famous acts from around the
world. The unsigned bands will be
selected through a nationwide com-
petition already under way called
Rock Idols, set up by Imperial
student Arjun Panesar. There will
also be an opportunity, through our
MedXstock representatives at all
other associated universities, for
bands to send their demo CD’s and
be in for a chance to play at the
festival.
There will also be a comedy arena,
a DJ tent and a chill out zone to
add variety on the day. African and
Asian acts will also be performing
throughout the festival to empha-
size which people the concert will be
truly benefitting.
Currently, we have applied to sev-
eral councils to host the concert in
London for the summer. An update
of the venue and date will be con-
firmed by the end of the month.
Through the concert and national
media coverage, issues surrounding
HIV and AIDS will be brought into
the spotlight. Finally, MedXstock
will illustrate the dynamic, versa-
tile and high-achieving capability of
Imperial’s students in both an aca-
demic and organisational environ-
ment.
I am going to need a great commit-
tee and a massive support network
working alongside me. If you agree
with the concept behind the concert
and are willing to help in any way
then please contact me. Even if it is
to tell me that I am not crazy, I need
to know.
