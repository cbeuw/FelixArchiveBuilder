Mission Impossible 3 What’s
with the sequels, you say? Two
words, Tom Cruise. Special
agent Ethan Hunt is back, with
perhaps a very Photoshop-edited
face or just a thick set of makeup.
Because, from the trailers, he was
pretty much wrinkle-free! Gasp.
Don’t you just want to know what
anti-wrinkle cream he uses?
Anyway, back to the story. Mission
Impossible 3 is pretty much the only
action film series that can garner
as much attention as James Bond.
Who’s the babe this season you say?
It’s the lovable Keri Russell, who
rose to fame with TV series Felicity.
And apart from the babe, what rea-
sons do we have for watching the
show? Firstly, it’s been 5 years since
Mission Impossible 2. Hence, imag-
ine the amount of technology that
has been developed in this number
of years.
The second reason is, of course,
the lead actor, Tom Cruise. He might
be getting on in years but he defi-
nitely knows how to stick around.
What with the ‘You complete me’ in
Jerry Macguire and the helicopter
moment in Mission Impossible 2,
any movie with him in it has got to
be cool and worth a watch. The third
reason is definitely the fact that
we’ve been facing a serious lack of
edgy and cool action thrillers. (Yes,
we have.) It’s coming out in May, so
don’t miss it!
S
tart the year right by
making the right choices.
Here’s a list of films Film
Felix pretty much can’t
wait to see (or have seen
and think are fabulous):
1
Memoirs of a Geisha Okay,
pardon my scepticism, but
I usually refrain from recom-
mending adaptations. It’s usually a
letdown. But ‘Memoirs of a Geisha’
is definitely the exception that dis-
proves the rule. In this edgy film,
Zhang Zi Yi assumes the lead role
as Sayuri, the geisha in the making.
To help her along is Mameha, played
by Michelle Yeoh. Mameha herself is
one of the most sought-after geisha
with a heart.
Unlike her, Hatsumomo, the most
beautiful geisha in the district,
(Gong Li) is determined to destroy
Sayuri. With a stellar cast consist-
ing of the three beauties of the east
and a handsome lead actor, Ken
Watanabe, could this movie even be
a flop? Into the Blue was a letdown
and it had the abs of Paul Walker
and the Coke-bottle figure of Jessica
Alba. Hence, this movie could still
be a flop.
Fortunately, it wasn’t. In fact, it
was beautiful and poetic. Never had
a movie used beauty to such effi-
ciency to express the more intricate
of human emotions i.e. desperation,
jealousy, insanity, jadedness, resil-
ience and falling in love. It’s released
tomorrow, guys! Don’t miss it!

Ice Age 2 Remember the poor
ancient squirrel, Scrat? He’s
back and he’s just as resilient
as ever to get his nut! For some
reason, I pretty much refused to
watch Ice Age when it came out.
But I was shocked to discover that
a story of prehistoric animals trying
to return a human baby to its parent
was actually entertaining. I know, I
know. And ever since then, I’ve been
in love with Sid and his extreme lack
of brain cells, which seems to work
out for him somehow.
Surprise, surprise! Because Ice
Age is back with a sequel entitled
Ice Age 2: The Meltdown. Okay, I
have to agree, the title lacks a wee
bit of imagination. But then again,
what an animation requires to suc-
ceed is a really cute but dumb char-
acter like Sid, a few humanized but
comedic animals such as Manny the
Mammoth (voiced by the hilarious
Ray Romano) and a family-friendly
script.
Okay, maybe not, but then again,
let’s stick to the story. In this sequel,
the Ice Age is coming to an end,
and, you’ve guessed it, (no prizes for
guessing) – the glaciers are all going
to melt and flood every other animal
to kingdom come. Sounds dull? I
don’t think so. Because not only do
they have to save the world with
their hilarious antics, Manny starts
to date as well. And it’s a girl mam-
moth, voiced by the lively and viva-
cious Queen Latifah no less. Hence,
Ice Age 2 is the animation to watch
out for this year. Kick ass, Sid!
I know I am
Looking forward to the New Year?

The Da Vinci Code Yes, it’s
the movie that everyone who
has read the book has been
waiting for. And yes, they could defi-
nitely have used a smoulderingly-
sexy man for the lead, such as Paul
Walker. But no, they are using the
most talented man in showbiz, Tom
Hanks, instead.
Like I’ve said, I never like to rec-
ommend adaptations. But this isn’t
just any adaptation. Why? Seriously,
if you do ask this question, you are
either a) surrounded by people who
don’t read or b) you imbecile, why
haven’t you read the bloody book?
To cut the long story short, it’s con-
troversial because it challenges the
traditional opinion of Jesus Christ.
Get this, Jesus Christ has a wife. Is
that possible?
As with every movie and every
story, I advise a little caution. Keep
in mind that theories are really
nothing but theories. Then again,
I’ll leave you space to form your
own opinion. Why watch it, you say?
Apart from the sensational sto-
ryline, there’s the talent of Tom
Hanks and the many beautiful views
of Rome and the Vatican City to look
out for. In a nutshell, it is definitely
popcorn-worthy.
Say what? Only four films to look
out for, no way! Of course not, more
to look out for in the next issue of
Felix. Until next week, people!

Cherry blossoms, a geisha and a unifying bridge of harmony. Sometimes cliches can be beautiful too.
Ice Age returns with the faithful Diego, the dependable Manny and air-head Sid!
