mentality regardless of geography.
We dropped the British girls off at
their University dorm and crossed
to the other side of town, over two
big motorway crossings to the boys’
hall. Yes, it was designed this way
specifically, there is to be no hanky-
panky. In fact, some of the lectures
in the university are carried out in
parallel single-sex streams.
It wasn’t always this way; the
University, at the behest of the gov-
ernment, is tending toward segrega-
tion rather than integration. This
seems to be a step backward, sys-
temic of the increasing influence of
more hardline Islamists in parlia-
ment.
Before I left, friends generally held
the view that Kuwait was repressive
in its attitudes towards women. This
is far from the truth. At present,
Kuwait has more registered women
voters than men. Granting women
the vote had been a contentious
issue, with parliament first voting
against, but the Amir (the leader of
the royal family, who has ultimate
power in how the country is run)
pushed the motion through. Women
haven’t actually voted yet but they
will in the forthcoming elections, in
which a number of female candi-
dates will be standing. Everywhere
we went, from the Stock Exchange
to National Science Centre, women
held high positions of authority.
Contrary to the accepted wisdom
that Kuwait just rose from the desert
after oil was discovered, there is evi-
dence suggesting Kuwait dates back
more than 500 years. Kuwait came
to fruition during British territo-
rial rule as a trading post between
Europe and India. Kuwaitis as a
trading people date back further
still, to when dhows (traditional sail
boats designed for calm waters)
sailed between Kuwait, East Africa
and the Indian subcontinent.
The next big boom was pearl
diving, which ended when the
Japanese invented the cultured
pearl. Incredibly fortunately, oil was
The devastation of the oil fields brings to life the horror of war; bullet-riddled metal litters the desert. Left

discovered at almost the same time.
Oil really is what Kuwait is all about.
The country just wouldn’t exist if
it wasn’t for oil. Kuwait has to be
one of the most inhospitable places
in the world, its pure unadulter-
ated desert stretching for mile after
mile, one of those luna landscapes
with absolutely no elevation. The
country has to import water, mak-
ing crop production an impossibility;
thousands of pounds alone must be
spent on keeping ornamental flower
gardens alive.
The 1991 Gulf War resulted from
Saddam Hussein’s thirst for wealth;
Kuwait has one third of the World’s
oil reserves. The memories of the
Gulf war are still vivid in the minds
of Kuwaitis, who mostly tried to stir
clear of the subject. But those who
were probed a little further clear-
ly held a deep resentment toward
Saddam.
During the war, Kuwait’s oil fields
were a sea of flames as millions
of dollars worth of oil was burned
every day. Although there are few
obvious signs of the ravages of war,
the burnt out oil distribution centres
are one stark reminder. Saddam’s
invasion had elements of the recent
US military’s shock and awe tactics:
silver was stripped from the top of
the iconic Kuwait towers.
Although Kuwait is said to have
at least 100 years of oil left, they are
looking to the future and other forms
of income. The Kuwait Centre for the
Advancement of Science is spend-
ing considerable funds on research,
including a grant to the Kuwait
Centre for Studies of Research into
aquaculture. They have so far suc-
cessfully bred Zubaidi, a popular
species of fish in the Middle East,
which had never been made to breed
in captivity before.
The Kuwaitis themselves will be
my abiding memory of the coun-
try. You really couldn’t ask for a
kinder, more hospitable bunch. We
were taken as friends into people’s
homes and were generally treated
fantastically. Zamzam, one of our
guides, even invited us to celebrate
her son teething with her extended
family at the beach. Yes, that’s right,
while you were cold and miserable I
was swimming in the sea and hav-
ing a BBQ. The food throughout
the trip was superb; shrimps big-
ger than your hand, succulent goat
and kebabs that you don’t need to
be totally off your face to consider
eating.
Which was fortunate, as there was
no way of getting even slightly tipsy.
After you collect your luggage at the
airport, you have to pass it through
another X-ray machine. We debated
the pointlessness of this: what’s the
point in checking your luggage after
you’ve been on the plane? It sud-
denly became clear when looking
under the counter to see bottles of
Whiskey. Kuwait is totally dry, its
not like Dubai where you can get
it if you pay through the nose for it.
Isn’t it convenient that there’s a pub
at Heathrow. Lovely.
