C
ompromise is a dangerous
notion, but so too is stub-
bornness. In today’s ever
changing world there are a
myriad of solutions to an infinitude of
differing problems, ponderings and
“situations”. One need not go into
the details of world conflict, peace
processes or devastated regions to
realise this. Nor is it necessary to
plunge into many of the complicated
discourses concerning the (compar-
atively) mundane events of our lives
that are beautifully small yet sweet,
stable and happy. Ah, to be of the
lucky few. Yet, what awaits ahead for
our society is as frightening as that
which has daunted our predeces-
sors. It seems that although Utopia
was in reach, with resources easily
distributable and huge technologi-
cal know-how, a world of uncertainty
remains, and the visage of Utopia
burns in ruin.
I am not being pessimistic, and
I am not simply giving in, saying
that “its too hard, no more, let me
out.” But no matter the technol-
ogy, knowledge or experiences of
humans in their individual nation
states, there will not be any mytho-
logical “Justice”. Compromise is
the sanctification of such a time.
It is the product of lengthy dis-
cussions, whether over children’s
packed lunches being nicked by
one runt or the other, or peace
negotiations of any kind. Neither
party involved in a disagreement
has full acceptance over terms, yet
both agree to “the best possibilities
for now”. To carry on with previous
demands on either side is deemed
foolish, costly and most uncertain.
You could lose your lunch, look
stupid in front of your mates, lose a
war, lose a people. I am not a gam-
bling man, but life is certainly not
a game. Are there any decisions in
life that are not debated between
men to be diluted or forsaken for
petty gains simply due to a power
interplay between the concerned
parties?
The simplicity of fairness
At face value

Imperial lacks
minority students
At face value Imperial looks very
multicultural, but a quick probe
beneath the surface reveals a
different story. At 41% Imperial
has one of the highest propor-
tion of ethnic minority students,
Cambridge and Oxford have only
12% and 9% respectively.
Although a high proportion of
students are from ethnic minority
groups, they are almost exclusively
international students.
There is wide agreement
amongst the students and the
College that the vast majority of
home students here are all white
middle class. Felix believes that
this is something that needs to be
addressed with haste.
Places should be granted solely
on academic merit, and Imperial
should not introduce positive dis-
criminatory measures. But College
needs to work hard to discover why
so few British students from eth-
nic minority backgrounds are not

Compromise does not induce
Justice, rather it can enshrine the
opposite. It is compromise that
shuts up someone of meagre stat-
ure in the hope that the mugger
will be appeased, and it is compro-
mise that allows forced marriages
and consequent rape because the
girl cannot adequately fend for
herself. Whenever a new opinion
presents itself, no matter how fair,
solutions must be compromised.
Yet there appears little else that
we can do. A constantly shifting
set of goal posts to accommodate
ever changing interests, we are a
people who think of the short term
possibilities and not of fanciful ide-
als. And it is for us that we think,
with the rest of humanity a bliss-
fully distant second. Too right too,
I do not want my provisions com-
promised. If Utopia cannot exist
everywhere, then let it exist for
us here for the privileged few. Has
it not always existed somewhere
in the world, at the expense of
the rest? It is the nature of man,
his selfish gene, that leads me to
think that there will always be the
strong and the weak. His nature
has not changed, and nor have our
problems despite the advances in
science. I’m not sure if there is any
way to tell if we are a truly better
off society globally than in the past,
considering the potential that we
have squandered in front of us.
Next week, see how much you
have to compromise. Of course,
my guess is that most of it is just
politeness. But do go find a good
cause, and see what you can effect.
And don’t be superficial, but see if
the system works against you to
thwart your little idea. Perhaps
that would convince you of the
impossibility of idealism. What
would it take for a man to not com-
promise, to risk that little extra
and not be bought off or sidelined?
More than food or money I’m sure.
I hope you all had good holidays.
Welcome back to Imperial.
studying here.
Michael Bajomo, Vice President
of the Union’s African Caribbean
Society (ACS) told Felix that some
black students tend to apply to
Universities with a well established
black community. If this is the
case, Universities that have large
minority populations will continue
to strengthen in diversity while oth-
ers, such as Imperial, may flounder.
The problem is not unique to
Imperial, the situation is similar
in all of the UK’s more established
universities.
Sports centre delayed
How long are we going to have to
wait for the sports centre to open?
This extra delay is extremely
aggravating to all, but giving us one
working day’s notice is completely
unacceptable!
Many students, including the
editor of this newspaper, cancelled
private gym memberships in the
anticipation of the new centre open-
ing and now have nowhere to train.

Hello again.
One of my colleagues made me
aware of your reply
To my previous email concerning
the low profile page 3
Of the student magazine.
Firstly I am from math depart-
ment and secondly I am quite
sceptic
About the success of this page as
you state in your reply.
I am pretty sure of something.
There are students that work
hard for the prestige of this
Institution
But there others, like you in this
case, that lack of this feeling of
bringing additional positive contri-
bution
To Imperial College.
It’s much easier filling 2 pages
with naked girls or boys than write
few more articles on science or
social life or technology.
You could think about dedicate 1
or 2 pages on outstanding past or
contemporary academics.
Reading about their lives and
achievements would be a better
inspiration for your readers than
Just looking at photos of naked
students.
Thirdly people do not complain
because they devote their time to
more serious things.
Please try to appreciate the time
I spent to write this email and most
important
I look forward to see a different
page 3 in the next future.
