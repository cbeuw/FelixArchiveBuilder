In typical cheeky style, the miners
hitched a ride on the IC hockey
coach heading out to Harlington.
After a last minute bail from one
team member, we were left with
10 men until Alice bravely volun-
teered to play in a men’s match (it’s
legal – check the rule book), then
promptly missed the coach. Never
fear, the rugby coach was only too
happy to let the belle of the RSM
hockey club have a seat on their
coach, as you might imagine. After
a surprisingly quiet ride with the
opposition, we set about watching
the IC 1sts match before us while
IC 4ths hit their warm-up routine.
At one point they were all doing
communal stretches in a circle and
we thought for a minute they might
burst into song. We were, however,
spared. After plenty of pre-match
banter with their captain on the
sidelines, we took to the pitch facing
ever-increasing bad light with the
floodlights out of action.
The IC 4ths started at a blistering
pace and had the run around of a
particularly lethargic RSM defence
for the first 10 mins. However, after
a few last ditch tackles from Mikey
and plenty of ‘organising’ (shout-
ing abuse) from the goalkeeper
Sam, the situation stabilised and
the miners began to play. Pikey, our
defender, was by this point injured
as tradition now dictates and played
an entire match in agony, hence the
special mention. The midfield was
a battlefield’s worth of carnage in
what would turn out to be a very
scrappy and gritty game. Tim, Alice
Nick and Mikey never really being
able to find the space they needed to
play properly in midfield, resorted
to a war of attrition. Neither team
managed to take an upper hand
in the first half but IC had clearly
spotted our danger man, Charles
P having to deal with two or three
markers at any one time.
At half time the score was 0-0 and
there was no certainty of victory.
In fact, the IC 4ths had matched us
in every department and given us
a good scare in the opening min-
utes. After introducing the midfield-
ers to the backs at half time, they
started (finally) to work together
and the second half was slightly less
scrappy. The 4ths were still match-
ing us all over the pitch but when
our chances came we took them.
Charles Thornton being the first to
open the RSM account with a very
tidy goal. After that, the miners saw
off a very reasonable attempt by the
4ths to score and Nick decided to
put another one away for safety. By
this point our opposition were still
fighting tooth and nail but Charles P
managed to slot another goal away
and give us a rather flattering score
line.
This was certainly not a case of
beautiful hockey but we showed we
could scrap it out with the best of
them and get three points on the
board. And Alice floored her mark-
er, much to his surprise. The post
match celebrations were every bit
as messy as the game itself; we wish
Charles P a swift recovery. Quote of
the day/champagne moment goes
to an anonymous IC 4ths player for
replying to Nick’s post-match hand-
shake with that well known sports-
manlike adage: ‘f*ck you’. Thanks
IC 4ths for a tough game and well
done to RSM.
Regular readers of Felix’s outstand-
ingSportsectionwilldoubtlessrecall
that back in October, IC’s favourite
pirate-themed football team hand-
ed the dirty, cheating medics a 7-1
spanking. With the memory of the
Harlington massacre still weighing
heavy on the minds of both teams,
the Mighty Mighty Sevens had sev-
eral questions that needed answer-
ing: Could the medics really play
as badly again? Would they have a
kit? Were they going to give up on
football mid-way through the first
half and start another kick-boxing
tournament? Only time would tell.
The air was tinged with anticipa-
tion as the battle-lines were drawn.
Sam deliberately lost the coin-toss
and the medics fell into his trap
of changing ends, an early mental
victory for the Sevens. The game
began with the kick-off, in the tradi-
tional fashion. Early medics pres-
sure suggested that IC may have a
tougher challenge on their hands
this time round, although the Sevens
almost pinched a goal on the coun-
ter attack after Sam chipped the
ball over the medics’ centre-back
and lobbed the keeper, only to see
the ball fly inches wide. Eventually,
the IC defence took the sting out of
the medics attack, and the Sevens
began to get a foothold in the game.
The first goal came when Sam’s
corner was headed in at the back
post by a suspiciously unmarked
Szczczczczesiak for his first IC goal.
Unconfirmed reports indicating that
he may have been hiding behind the
goal prior to the corner being taken
remain unconfirmed at the time of
going to press.
Sam made it 2-0 to IC with a
screamer (see diagram), a curl-
ing first-time strike from 25 yards
into the bottom corner. That was
the way the score stayed until half-
time. The Sevens finally clicked
into top gear after the restart and
threw everything they had at the
medics. Debutant Matias scored
the third after skinning his marker
and placing the ball into the far
corner, and the Sevens fourth goal
came after another piece of comedy
medic defending when the centre
back chested Pete’s cross into his
own goal, 4-0 IC.

Well, we’ve been somewhat quiet
recently, but don’t worry, we’re still
rucking, mauling, drinking and cre-
ating our usual brand of chaos! As
for a quick summary of the term
so far:
We picked up record numbers
of freshers at the start of term
and headed off for our first match
against GKT. We have quite a his-
tory against GKT and this year was
no exception (we even pinched one
of their best players, she defected to
IC this year!). We came through vic-
torious, 12-5 with virgin tried from
Tumbles and newbie The Flash. St
Mary’s were second and a slightly
different story. A bedraggled vir-
gin squad (and two rather plucky
lacrosse girls that we managed to
snaffle) battled hard but lost 55-0.
The third match saw us run out 27-
10 winners against Wye and again
gave us virgin tries, this time from
Cherry P and GKT.
So, onto the matter in hand:
Roehampton. This was a home
match and we arrived at the pitch
(or should I say sand pit) and won-
dered if Roehampton had brought
any backs. Faced with an opposition
composed almost entirely of props,
some of our slimmer players looked
a bit worried!
We kicked off and found that
appearances hadn’t been deceiv-
ing and Roehampton weren’t the
fastest opposition we’d ever come
up against! What they were good
at, however, was mauling, commit-
ting a sheer force of bodyweight
that the virgins couldn’t match.
So despite spending a lot of time
in the Roehampton half, we spent
most of it in futile mauls going
nowhere and knackering the for-
wards! It was then that the main
feature of the game started happen-
ing – scrums. And more scrums.
Oh, and some more scrums. I’m
not sure if we had a scrum that
worked first time throughout the
whole match! The virgins have a
We’re still here, just less
vocal than last year!
At 4-0 up and with everything going
swimmingly, the Seven’s pirate ship
suddenly sprang a leak. A long ball
(surprise, surprise) from the med-
ics keeper was uncharacteristically
missed by the otherwise outstand-
ing Seven’s defence, and cheating
ex-IC player John Scott scored with
a neat, if somewhat Judas-esque
finish. Another almost identical goal
followed shortly after and the pirate
ship had entered uncharted, stormy
waters. With captain Sam setting
a fine example by losing his head
while all around him were also los-
ing theirs, IC began to panic and a
nervous 20 minutes ensued. A cou-
ple of let-offs and near-misses later,
however, the storm subsided and
IC’s pirate ship emerged battered
but unbowed with a 4-2 victory.
A cut-out-and-keep guide: How to splaff on medics à la Sam
7th XI end 2005 on a comical note fairly experienced scrum and can
hold their own against most teams,
but Roehampton had some, shall we
say, interesting scrum techniques!
Twisting, collapsing, wonky, injuries,
badly fed balls, balls coming straight
out, you name it – it went wrong!
Still, when the scrums did even-
tually lead to play, Spandex made
some awesome steals to put us back
on the attack. Then our advantage
really came into play. We may have
been down a player compared to
Roehampton, but our backs ran
rings around them! Storming runs
from pretty much all of them gained
us valuable ground. The Flash man-
aged to skip round three of them to
score our opener. We hadn’t learnt
though and were still taking it into
mauls, then either losing ground
or the ref deciding nothing would
come of it. Roehampton fought back
after going down in the scoring and
crashed over the line just before
half-time to even the score.
After a team talk, we went into the
second half with a different tactic
and saw almost immediate results.
It seemed Roehampton were not
familiar with the concept of rucking
(kind of just standing there and look-
ing at us) and going to ground four
times in succession took us almost
to their try line. After the usual
5 scrums, the ball was spun out
to the backs where a blinding run
from GKT nearly gave us our second
try, but unfortunately the pass to
Tumbles on the line was forwards
and we were denied. GKT shortly
afterwards went off down the pitch
again (towards the bar, apparently
she could smell the beer!) and this
time got through to make it 10-5. We
continued to ruck and pushed our
advantage. The Flash was held up
on the line, but we came back again
and Tumbles sprinted round several
players to extend our lead. We spent
most of the rest of the game reset-
ting scrums again and despite some
good kicking from Roehampton,
managed to avoid our half entirely.
Forward of the match went to our
new girl Ali (so new she doesn’t have
a bar name yet!) who gave cracking
support throughout. Back went to
GKT for general fabulousness. A
special mention should also go to
Monkey, continuing the virgin tradi-
tion of kicking props!
