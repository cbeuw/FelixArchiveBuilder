The last time I remember an article
about ICMC in Felix was when a
wheel fell off our minibus. Come to
think of it, the time before that was
when we rolled another one. Since
then, Kev has left and the quality
of Union minibuses has improved
dramatically, so I’d like to correct
this potentially negative impression
of the club and persuade you that
getting out of London and climb-
ing is the only way to spend your
weekends.
When I ask most people why they
don’t climb, I get the answer that
they don’t like heights. In fact, nei-
ther do many climbers. Although
the sport was originally the domain
of Victorian gentlemen looking for
exotic ways to die, it has evolved
now into many different disciplines.
Traditionalists still seek adventure
in long difficult routes, but many of
us prefer to stick to leisurely sports
climbing. “Boulderers”, another
breed, concentrate on technique,
building up strength and skill on
short, intense, and well protected
(safe) climbs.
There are plenty of opportunities
to try these styles of climbing, and
more, on our fortnightly weekend
trips around the UK. Peak District
gritstone and Dartmoor granite
provide technical short routes and
bouldering, and anything from long
rock routes to frozen waterfalls can
be found in Wales. However, my
favourite areas are the limestone
sea cliffs on the coasts of Pembroke
and Swanage. There is no feeling
like standing at the base of a rock
face, belaying a climber with waves
lapping at your feet as the tide slow-
ly but surely advances towards your
ledge. There are plenty of less scary
spots in England, but none are as
atmospheric and special as the sea
cliffs.
With the variety and quality of rock
only a few hours drive from London,
you may ask why we ever go abroad.
As you can imagine, the weather is
our enemy. Swanage may be glori-
ous on warm sunny days, but warm
sunny days are in short supply in
England. Therefore, during the holi-
days, we head off in search of drier
climes and warmer temperatures.
Last year, club members climbed
in the US, France, Thailand, Spain,
Croatia and, most recently for our
summer tour, a very successful trip
to Lake Garda in Italy, organised by
our untiring president Herman.
During the summer, Lake Garda
itself is filled with people sailing,
waterskiing, windsurfing and doing
every other kind of watersport
imaginable, but surrounding it are
a series of low altitude mountains.
These constitute the southern end
of the Dolomites, the chain that runs
north through Italy, becoming the
Alps. You won’t find any snow or ice
at such a low altitude, so the area is
packed with a variety of warm and
spectacular rock routes.
Despite my addiction to the local
pizzarias and gelaterias in Arco (the
town in which we were staying),
the highlight of the trip for me was
“Placche Zibrate”, a collection of
routes up an unbroken 500m slab of
rock. This area is also popular with
BASE jumpers, who throw them-
selves off an overhanging buttress
just above the routes. Taking advan-
tage of the thirsty outdoor folk is a
small bar at the base of this crag.
It even had binoculars so we could
enjoy a cold drink at dusk while
watching our fellow climbers’ head
torches as their relaxed route turns
into a night-time epic.
Unique to the Dolomites are “Via
Ferrata”, “Iron roads” of guide-
rails and ladders bolted to the rock
through the mountains. They were
originally constructed so that the
Italian army could move quickly
through the Dolomites, but recently
they have been restored and extend-
ed for visiting walkers and climbers.
Whilst never as hard as the normal
climbing, they give the opportuni-
ty to move fast and safely through
stunning mountain scenery, with lit-
tle effort.
Another high point was climbing
by the lake itself, for many of us our
first attempt at deep water soloing.
This involves climbing up the rock
face to around 40 feet without a rope,
and then jumping into the lake. It’s
the most wonderful feeling – to be
able to climb without a harness on
a hot day and then cool off in fresh
water. All in all this year’s summer
trip was a fantastic success.
Unfortunately, London isn’t sur-
rounded by sunbathed mountains,
but it does contain some of Europe’s
biggest and best climbing walls.
These may not be the same as real
rock, but you can build up strength,
stamina and technique in safety and
comfort during the week. We also
use climbing centres to teach fresh-
ers the basics of climbing, before
they go on the weekend trips. We
have new people joining us through-
out the year, many of whom have
never even seen a rope before. So
if you are interested at all in climb-
ing, want something to take your
mind off work, or are looking for
something more exciting than jog-
ging around Hyde Park, then come
along and join us. We meet in Beit
Quad, by the Union entrance, at
1pm every Wednesday. All you need
to bring are comfortable clothes to
climb in, so come and get involved!
