Emile Hirsh charms as the wild one but old Americana overshadows him
The Wild Ways of Mr Sean Penn
SeanPennisoftenadmiredasthegreat-
est actor of his generation, endowed
with a knack of longevity despite play-
ing characters that are not particularly
well-liked. This isn’t the same as the
likes of Christopher Lee where recur-
ring villainous roles fill a filmography
out nicely, but rather that of espousing
an acting ability so strong that an audi-
ence can get past his characters’ flaws,
even be they rape and murder. This is
not to say that audience likeability ap-
pears to bother Penn, and in fact, as
an actor, he appears bothered that the
audience is even part of his work. As
he returns to directing however, the
burden of the audience and the con-
veyance of a story would seem to rest
much more on his shoulders, so what
really is Sean Penn’s problem?
Penn doesn’t appear to be a media
fan. He spends the entire conference
we have sat cross-legged, with arms
folded and speaks quickly and quietly,
almost mumbling at points sending a
worry around the room that nobody’s
microphone would even pick it up.
The only time he seems to have a real
interest in the event is when he listens
to star of his new film, Emile Hirsch,
who is sat next to him, fit in a few
words, breaking a smile like a proud
father. This isn’t too big a surprise giv-
en the typical banality of these things
compared with being on the set of his
latest film, Into The Wild, carving out
a gorgeous slice of old Americana, but
you think he’d give us something to
work with.
The impression that is given is one of
love for his work, rather than the publi-
cising of it, a standard for anyone with
the credibility he has attained. His dis-
taste for the media since his marriage
to Madonna in the eighties seems to
have stuck with him while she has sim-
ply turned to playing them like an eight
year old girl manages Barbie dolls. But
with a body of work like Penn’s,
it is easy to understand why
it is of more interest than
how he’s living his per-
sonal life.
After a string of
roles from the
early eighties,
he solidified
his talent in
the early
nineties
with Brian
De Palma’s
Carlito’s
Way and
then got
the Acad-
emy talk-
ing with
Tim Rob-
bins’ Dead
Man Walk-
ing by 1995.
The latter
performance
saw him receive
his first nod for
playing a man on
death row fight-
ing for life with the
help of a nun, Susan
Sarandon, who walked
away with her own statu-
ette. From there, Penn moved
into a different stream and in
the early part of this century
seemed to develop an inter-
est in documentaries but
still turned in outstand-
ing performances in the
likes of I Am Sam, 21
Grams and Mystic
River, the latter
of which se-
Oscar winning actor and former Mr Madonna talks to Felix about acting, LA love and passion for directing.

Being selected as the Kyoto Planet
Gala in this years festival is definitely
not beyond the scope of reason where
this film is concerned as its celebration
of nature is unmatched amongst the
other selections this year. In fact, the
true story of Chris McCandless and his
voyage into the wilderness of the Unit-
ed States has such breathtaking images
of nature that it’s hard to believe a large
part of it wasn’t funded by the Alaskan
tourist board. Fifteen years after the
story first unfolded, Sean Penn gives it
the big screen treatment it’s been wait-
ing for, with a backdrop that you just
don’t find in a studio.
Chris McCandless was a university
graduate back in the early nineties who
took off to explore his country away
from society, donating all his money to
charity and leaving his family no way
to contact him. His transformation
into his alias Alexander Supertramp
saw him travel between Mexico and
Alaska, living on the road and meet-
ing various characters along the way.
With the voyage transferred to a cin-
ema screen, its hard to imagine why
America established its greatest cities
in places such that nobody would ever
see these wonders. Thankfully Penn
was on hand to show them what they
were missing.
Emile Hirsch throws himself into the
central performance with the convic-
tion and look very reminiscent of an
early Penn. Without such a perform-
ance the film would not work, and
Hirsch proves a treat to watch on his
adventure. The supporting cast of
characters that Chris/Alex meets along
the way is full of comfortable perform-
ances, including the Vince Vaughn and
the ever malleable Catherine Keener,
here a hippie on the road with her
boyfriend in some very touching mo-
ments. It is without doubt the mo-
ments of interaction with these people
that surpass the films potential as an
advert for America and make the story
the real biographical journey of human
interest that it is.

tunate parents whilst Jena Malone’s
infrequent voice-over as the sister ex-
periencing various feelings about her
brothers disappearance reminds the
audience that this is a human story
rather than just an adventure yarn.
Sean Penn, being a particularly out-
spoken detractor of the war in Iraq and
American foreign policy in the post-
9/11 age, expresses with conviction the
desire to escape a society controlled by
material possessions and hollow pre-
occupations. His direction seems more
fluid than previous outings and raises
his skills towards those of his acting
abilities, but with so much passion for
this particular piece it will be interest-
ing to see if this can be carried over to
other projects in the future.
The primary criticism of Into The
Wild would have to be that it feels
slightly overlong. The episodic nature
of the journey is broken up by cutting
between pieces in Alaska and the rest
of the quest, and then the scenes of the
family left behind but as it moves from
one set of characters to the next, it be-
gins to get weighed down under the
burden of time. Whilst each person
has something to add you can’t help
but wish they did so that bit faster.
This doesn’t stop it being a largely
enjoyable film however, and the cin-
ematography will no doubt sweep
the boards come award time. If Penn
makes it as well, then he could join the
hallowed halls of the select few who
can call themselves ‘actor/director’
with any degree of credibility.
Actually, it doesn’t take an award
to recognise the talent that this film
shows.
Yes, “wild” doesn’t begin to cover it...
cured him the Oscar. It is
Sam however which of-
fers possibly the best
look at his range as
an actor though,
especially com-
pared with River
and Dead Man
Walking, as his
portrayal of an
autistic father
desperately try-
ing to keep cus-
tody of his child
(a young Dakota
Fanning, before
she became the to-
ken child in every
film that required
it) displays an inno-
cence and character
skills far removed
from the violent per-
sonae of the other
two.
Into The Wild
doesn’t star Sean Penn
however, it’s directed
by him. The attempt
at direction by stars
can be a mixed bag
though; for every Clint
Eastwood success story
(well, if success is judged
on awards over integrity),
there’s another handful who
just thought that it looked
too easy and were just hushed-
up. Previous directorial efforts
from Penn himself have received
mixed response since his de-
but in the chair back in The
Indian Runner (1991)
and little known
subse-
quent works, The Crossing Guard and
The Pledge. With Into The Wild, Penn
has certainly improved his talent as a
storyteller along with his visual eye,
but will it be sufficient to break free of
the actor tag?
Here’s hoping so, for his sake, as
Penn has a slightly surprising view
of acting: “Most of why I acted in the
last ten years was to steal film school
time from these guys. Those were the
choices I was making, looking at direc-
tors that I could learn from.” Whatever
that says about the wider view actors
hold of their profession, it’s surprising
to hear such an opinion from someone
near the top of the pile in terms of act-
ing talent using it as a stepping stone.
On direction he states: “If what you’re
looking for is love and you’re looking
for it every night in bars in Los Ange-
les, you’re lucky if once every five years
you find what it is and then you’ll have
affairs. In moviemaking, an affair with
a piece of material is not going to cut
it cause you gotta stay in love for years
to get through it. I think I know more
what I’m looking for in that love than
before.”
It shouldn’t really come as such a
surprise that Penn wants more than
someone else’s words to work with.
He’s had a very strong voice of his
own in terms of politics, appearing
quite publicly to denounce the Bush
administration and their war in Iraq,
so transposing that eloquence of opin-
ion to a storytelling perspective would
seem appealing. He certainly seems to
display a real enthusiasm for accuracy
in the detail he refers to in recreating
the true story of Chris McCandless in
this latest picture. Penn has had access
to the greatest directing talent in Hol-
lywood and beyond as he says, and it
certainly seems he has plenty drive to
focus his attentions on direction rather
than acting. Could he be the next Clint
Eastwood? Not if he wants to remain a
rogue maverick.
