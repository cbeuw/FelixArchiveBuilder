GSA Chair resigns in dramatic style
Union left to prop up the GSA after Jon Matthews resigned at Council on Monday
On Monday night, the second Council
meeting of the year took place in the
Union Dining Hall. The evening pro-
gressed with the usual mix of policy
and report rubber-stamping until the
final moments when the meeting fin-
ished in unexpectedly dramatic fashion
as the Graduate Student’s Association
(GSA) Chair, Jon Matthews, resigned
and subsequently exited the building.
Mr Matthews had to produce a re-
vised report to Council because the pa-
per he submitted earlier in the month
was rejected. The general feeling was
that Mr Matthews’ original report
didn’t justify the £2000 honorarium
payment he was given for being GSA
Chair, hence the need for a rewrite.
The first Councillor to voice his
opinion on Monday night about Mr
Matthews’ latest report was ICSMSU
President, Tim Wills, who took objec-
tion to his work with graduate-medical
students. As the discussion continued
more and more people began to raise
questions, giving an indication that Mr
Matthews’ wouldn’t be getting off quite
so lightly this evening.
After an initial round of voting, four
people voted for the report with an-
other four voting against, whilst the
remaining Councillors abstained. Cou-
rageously, Mr Matthews called for a re-
count of the vote, probably hoping that
the votes would fall in his favour, how-
ever it was to be his undoing; Council
voted 6-5 to reject his report (with
over 10 abstentions). The result meant
that Council would automatically have
to vote on whether to censure Mr Mat-
thews or not; a censure is effectively an
official slap on the wrist or a way of say-
ing: “you’ve been a naughty person.”
However, before the Councillors
even had a chance to wave their vot-
ing cards in the air, Mr Matthews stood
tall announcing his resignation, before
walking out of the Union Dining Hall
leaving the GSA committee with pre-
cisely zero members.
Rather ironically, Mr Matthews’
was involved in a successfully passed
censure motion in February this year,
when he instigated disciplinary action
against the former Deputy President
(Graduate Students), Shama Rahman.
By taking on the role of GSA Chair
over the summer, Mr Matthews ef-
fectively took over from Ms Rahman
as the figurehead for postgraduate
representation, since the DPGS posi-
tion was scrapped at the end of the last
academic year. At the time, the censure
passed against Ms Rahman was the
first in twenty years, but the boot was
on the other foot at this week’s Coun-
cil and Mr Matthews was firmly on the
receiving end.
Critics believe that Mr Matthews
could have done much more to help the
GSA’s cause over the summer. The ex-
Deputy President has been condemned
for the lack of a GSA stall at Freshers’
Fair, no postgraduate parties or events
and a seemingly non-existent push to
get people to stand for the empty po-
sitions on the GSA committee during
the recent elections period. Mr Mat-
thews has reiterated that he has found
it difficult being the only member of
the GSA, having to be the point of con-
tact for postgraduates all by himself.
His reasoning for not having a Fresh-
ers’ Fair stall is more dubious however.
He stated in his report that he felt it
would be better for postgraduates “to
spend the day looking at the clubs the
Union has to offer.”
Also brought into question recently
was the manner in which Mr Matthews
received the £2000 honorarium pay-
ment. It’s not known how exactly the
money was awarded to the GSA Chair
and the Union has repeatedly asked for
an audit trail to be provided, but Mr
College
getting set for
Green Roof
Earlier during Monday’s Council (be-
fore the dramatics discussed in the sto-
ry to the left), a policy was tabled and
successfully passed detailing the plans
for a new Green Roof to be built on one
of the College’s rooftops.
Readers can rest assured that the
Green Roof isn’t simply an aesthetic
accompaniment to the pink Bessemer
Building. Instead a Green Roof is in
actual fact a trendier name for an envi-
ronmentally friendly garden rooftop.
The idea was brought to Council by
the RAG Chair Karandeep Dhanoa
who sought the Union’s backing. Vari-
ous staff members on campus have
already taken a keen interest in the
Green Roof project and College has
said it will foot the bill.
If all goes well and the final propos-
als get the go ahead, the Green Roof
should have a number of functions.
Hopefully it will act as a social space
for students making up for the other
green areas that are being replaced
by redevelopment projects; fingers
crossed that College’s army of mar-
quees doesn’t invade the rooftop too.
Furthermore, less heat will be lost from
the roof, runoff water will be recycled
and it will have a longer life span than
conventional flat roofs.
Interestingly, students will be re-
sponsible for designing the Green Roof
as part of their coursework. Biologists
will be required to design the ecosys-
tem, Mechanical Engineers will be
tasked with producing a watering sys-
tem and Civil Engineers will need to
ensure the roof doesn’t cave in.

Matthews has claimed to be otherwise
occupied and unable to provide the
necessary details. Although Mr Mat-
thews was rather publicly mauled on
Monday night, his lack of communi-
cation with the Union on this matter
didn’t help his case.
The incident on Monday night has
highlighted problems beyond Mr Mat-
thews’ resignation though. Firstly, why
did so many of the Councillors abstain
from voting? Was it for personal rea-
sons, having to work with or attend
College with someone they wanted
censured? Or did the Councillors not
fully understand the situation? Was in-
experience the cause?
Secondly, and of more immedi-
ate concern: where does the GSA go
from here? The current GSA election
has been suspended, although only
one person was running for any of the
positions anyway. At the moment, the
Union Presidents are taking on the du-
ties performed by the GSA until it can
establish an interim board. Yet more
GSA elections will have to be held and
it will be at least a month, if not longer
before the committee is reformed. This
is all assuming postgraduates want to
get involved with reviving the GSA an-
yway. Felix has approached a number
of postgraduates asking them for com-
ment in the light of Monday’s events
and the response has mainly been:
“What’s the GSA?” Or, “I don’t really
care.”
The Union is going to have to work
hard if it wants to bring back the GSA
properly, plus it’s going to need to put
in even more effort if it wants to im-
prove the association’s currently dis-
mal profile. The election for the next
committee will be the fourth within
a year and the Union will need to put
together a strong campaign to elect
someone for the cursed position of
postgraduate student representative.
The GSA needs a motivated leader and
the Union needs to work closely with
that person whilst ensuring that an ef-
fective permanent member of staff is
employed to work alongside the part-
time Chair.
