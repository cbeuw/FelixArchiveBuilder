Fun & Games
Virgo
On Monday you will
hear a sheep sneeze
violently. This is
extremely fortuitous
and slightly out-
weighs the intense
emotional rollercoaster that having Mars
orbiting your sign produces. Gather some of
the sheep snot and keep it as a talisman for
good luck in the future. On Wednesday you
will discover that you have a genital wart.
Scorpio
Due to the near
collision of Jupiter
and the asteroid
“Arsticus” your week
will be somewhat
mixed. Your socks
will melt and stick your feet to your shoes
on Tuesday. Avoid riding mechanical bulls at
sex-toy parties. In fact, avoid sex alltogether
this week, especially as you can’t remove your
shoes.
Libra
Your recent letter
to the campaign
against curtains
society has been
returned unopened.
This is a sign from
the heavens. Give up your hatred and learn
to accept curtains into your life. Embrace
blinds instead, and don’t forget to water your
catapillars.
Sagittarius
This week you are
fat! Yes, you have
gone over your ideal
weight and everyone
hates you for it. The
only solution is for
you to vomit yourself into nothingness. That’s
it, shove those fingers down your throat and
HEAVE, HEAVE, HEAVE! With every heave
you are achieving more social acceptance. Peo-
ple might start talking to you again.
Capricorn
This week you read
the above horoscope
and complain.
BECAUSE THAT IS
WHAT YOU DO!
You take any sort of
amusement out of any situation and whinge,
whinge, whinge, whinge until even your
kidneys are lashing out condemnation. That or
you are bulemic. In which case, sorry.
Cancer
With Mercuy ris-
ing through your
sign in the celestial
heavens, make sure
that you start many
arguments. Avoid
large men in hats. Also this week represents
the best chance you have for the next 20 years
in which to have a threesome. Good luck and
use rohypnol if necessary.
Gemini
As Saturn is moving
retrograde you will
feel the need to
gorge on cheese and
mince pies. This is
not the time to start
new pieces of coursework as you will just end
up writing shite. Wait until next week when
Uranus will be rising and inspiring you to
great feats of literary genius. Avoid red doors,
they will lead to unconrollable hiccoughs.
Leo
No you are not cool
for thinking that you
look awesome in
your new track-
suits. When I am
king, tracksuits will
be outlawed and you will burnt alive in your
extremely flammable attire. Yeah, you, I am
talking to you! It is a tracksuit, not ‘running at-
tire’ and you will die die die die die die die die
die die die die.. DIE!
Taurus
The recent full
moon means the
spotlight is on
you and you must
perform and recite
the entire works of
Wordsworth through your nose before your
kneecaps turn into Coco Pops and explode.
Think carefully before you eat anything
hairless this week, and watch out for falling
coconuts.
Aries
After your en-
counter with the
Grundfuttock last
week, your bottom
has been strangely
sore and rather red.
I told you to run away and hide, but oh no, you
don’t listen to horoscopes because they aren’t
“scientific”. Well you’re paying for it now! Re-
peat after me, I will heed the horoscopes!
Pisces
You will meet your
anti-matter self
wandering around
somewhere in Chem
Eng. You will then
disappear in a blid-
ing flash of logical impossibility, taking most
of Chem Eng with you (what a shame). Note
that this is not an excuse not to hand in your
coursework on time. Lack of existance is not
an excuse!

Wordoku is identical to sudoku;
we’ve just replaced the numbers
with letters. Once you’ve
completed the puzzle, there
is a hidden word or phrase to
find. Email in your answers to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
The winner of the Wordoku
1,384 was Louis Tsang.
The hidden phrase was
“ZYGOMATIC”.

Aquarius
You will wake one
morning next week
with a massive
growth on the side
of your face. Then
you will discover
it is in fact the kebab you were eating when
you fell asleep last night. On to more positive
news, you will find that kebab makes quite a
good breakfast, although it is written in the
stars that you will see it again later in the day...

How to rate yourself:
Under 10 words: I’m surprised if you have
the ability to read with this score!
10 - 18 words: I dispair of you.
18 - 24 words: Now we’re getting there,
but don’t get complacent!
25 or more words: You cunning linguist!
Your grasp of English is turning me on
baby... oh yeaaaah...
Last week’s solution:
The only seven letter word was:
SATSUMA
Congratulations if you got this.
Other words included:
amass, mass, mast, masts, mats, muss,
must, musts, muts, smut, smuts, sums,
tams.
How to play:
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up with
must include the central letter. Capitalised
words, conjugated verbs (past tense etc),
adverbs ending in “-ly”, comparatives and
superlatives are disallowed.
An example of a word you can’t do in
this particular Polygon is “virgin”. Clearly,
this is not possible because you are miss-
ing the letters “v”, “i”, “r”, and “g”.
