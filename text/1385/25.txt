Buscemi on getting it wrong
S
ince the late eighties, Steve
Buscemi has been one of
the most instantly recog-
nisable faces of the Ameri-
can indie scene. His roles
in such films as Reservoir Dogs and
Ghost World along with his many col-
laborations with the Coen Brothers
in classics such as Fargo and The Big
Lebowski have cornered him a niche in
the market playing oddball characters.
Now stepping up to the mic at the
NFT to deliver one of the festival’s
eagerly awaited screentalks, Film
Felix asks whether or not he can
captivate without his characters.
Buscemi has made it surprising-
ly big in cinema considering that
he is known best for supporting
roles. He intersperses appear-
ances in independent produc-
tions with a couple of big mon-
ey deals in the likes of Con Air
and Armageddon to “ensure
the smaller films get paid for”
as he puts it, and you’d be hard
pushed to ever call him a sell
out.
With Interview included in
the official London festival
selection though, it is his role
as director and lead actor that
bring him to our glorious city,
and whilst not his first stab
at directing, the attention the
film has already garnered would
seem to suggest that this is some-
thing he may want to consider
again in the future. Yet, depite
being selected for a screentalk,
Buscemi doesn’t seem to have that
much to say for himself.
His anecdootes tend to fall way
short of the strangeness you ex-
pect from his character. For
example, when asked about
his collaborations with
the Coens he
lays
Taking over NFT1, Steve Buscemi headlines the TCM screentalk with a unique style
the foundations for a great story only
for the punchline to be “I read the
script fastest and so I got the job” in a
nutshell.
He seems to show a certain amount
of impatience throughout as well. The
talk was not given in the form of a lec-
ture but an on-
stage
Delicious digging up of much more than just dirt in interview with a vamp
The genesis of Interview has an appeal
more intriguing than its own concept.
The film itself is a remake, the original
being the work of Theo Van Gogh, a
Dutch director little known outside of
his own country until his murder at the
hands of an Islamic extremist, unhappy
with the portrayal of religion in one of
his films, attracted the attention of the
film world.
In conflict with many European film-
makers, Van Gogh did not shun the
Hollywood machine and dreamed of
making films there, a dream that his as-
sociates did not want to break just be-
cause of his passing. Instead of letting
his legacy lie in the Netherlands, they
took three of his films to Hollywood
for him and set about having them re-
made with Hollywood stars, the first of
which was to become Interview.
The premise of the film is simple
and much less Hollywood. Steve Bus-
cemi switches sides of the camera to
both direct and star here, helming the
role of the interviewer, Pierre, a poli-
tics journalist sent by his office to in-
terview soap starlet and tabloid bait
Katya, the ever-so-appropriate Sienna
Miller. Katya, as is described early on,
is not exactly the Hilary Clinton-style
catch Pierre wishes he could sideline,
but rather a fluctuating bust with a
very public love life. Is Miller really so
unaware that she didn’t see her name
all over this?
Interview strives beyond simple stunt
casting though to question its subjects,
and thrives on the assumptions of the
audience. Sienna seizes the screen with
a sexy, strong performance that leaves
you astonished. An audience unaware
of her talent react with shocked awe,
parallel to that which Pierre experi-
ences at the hands of Katya’s surpris-
ingly eclectic attitude. An intellectual
tête-à-tête between the pair twists and

turns to form the basis of the story,
poking delightful fun at the media
perception we have of modern starlets
and also the underlying similarities
that people from completely different
walks of life hold.
If the concept sounds tedious, rest
assured that it is not. The central per-
formances are both fantastic with Bus-
cemi managing to direct himself be-
yond the scope his normal supporting
roles allow him, and Miller simply glit-
tering with a stunning range. The two
leads explore themselves much more
than any real interview would allow,
and the script dazzles with humour,
emotion and wit. The primary setting
of Katya’s loft apartment allows the
camera crew to waltz casually around
the action that plays out like dialogue
driven theatre.
Interview is a film that within the
first half hour wipes clean your pre-
conceptions and admiration floods in
to fill the vacuum instantly. At the in-
credibly short running time of 82 min-
utes it doesn’t have much time to work
its magic, but it manages with reels of
film to spare. The Van Gogh original
may still remain obscure with such a
fantastic remake looming over it, but it
has done something to bring his name
and work to a larger audience. It is per-
haps the rehabilitation of Sienna Mill-
er’s image that stands to be the greatest
achievement of this film however, and
all this in spite of the films clear mes-
sage that there is always much more
than what you see on screen…
It takes two to tango
interview, resembling a press confer-
encewith a live studio audience, espe-
cially when they open up the floor to
questions. In this environment, his im-
patience is easily understood however.
When invited to talk about your
work, anyone with a sense of integrity
might expect to discuss the artistic
merits on which they are judged,
not “How do you feel about
being voted sexiest man alive
by US magazine?” or “How
would I deliver my script
into the hands of some-
one of such stature as
yourself?”. Brown
nosing and selfish-
ness rarely make
for a crowd pleas-
er. In this sense
it is hard to get a
true view of an
actor trying to
express a more
personal voice
as a director.
On topics of
suitability how-
ever, Buscemi
is a man full of
praise for any-
one he deems
worthy of it. He
isn’t shy about
telling of the talent
of the Coen broth-
ers as writers and direc-
tors but at the same time he
avoids gushing uncontrol-
lably. When asked about his
influences in moviemaking
style, he is similarly quick to
point to the influence of the
grandfather of American
indie cinema, John Cas-
savettes and the
new
style that he brought to film at the
time.
“The thing I like about Cassavettes
is that I saw a retrospective of his
works after he’d died and what struck
me about them was that it was okay to
get it wrong. As a writer I was always
told you have to have your beginning,
middle and end before you start writ-
ing and that was something that had
always got me: I would have a begin-
ning but I could never define where the
middle would bulk out. What I saw
from Cassavettes is that you don’t have
to always know where you’re going and
in so many of his films you don’t know
where you’re going to go next so it’s al-
right to be uncertain of that and for me
that was just such a blessed relief that I
really admired him.”
This is a feature not glaringly obvious
in Interview, although the constantly
meandering dynamics of the principal
characters’ relationship does invest a
certain amount of fun into his nar-
rative stylings. However, even when
asked about his message in Interview,
about the media and its portrayal of
celebrity these days, he dismisses it as
unimportant to the film. “I don’t think
Interview is essentially about celebrity
and the culture surrounding it. The
way I see it is as a film about two peo-
ple from completely different worlds
who find that beneath the surface they
have a lot more in common than is ob-
vious”. So, no scathing comment there
then, at least not consciously. He’s also
quick to shoot down the other stand-
ard suggestion of credible subject mat-
ter: “I certainly don’t feel I need a turn
to politics to justify myself”.
Perhaps this is what may lead to Bus-
cemi’s failure as a director over time.
To retain credibility, you have to have
something to say. Judging from this
particular interview, that looks like it
might be a problem.
Let’s just hope that he finds a clearer
voice amongst some better questions
soon.

T
his week sees the end of
another year at the Lon-
don Film Festival, so as
cinephiles readjust to nat-
ural sunlight, we at Felix
have chosen a small selection of what
we thought was worth catching.
It hasn’t been an easy choice decid-
ing what to bring you, but we made a
few educated guesses at what you’d like
to follow and hopefully there’s enough
to cover something for everyone. As-
sumptions in place, this week’s bumper
film section includes profiles on two of
America’s most interesting filmmak-
ers, Steve Buscemi and Sean Penn,
both making the dangerous leap from
acting in front of the camera to get-
ting into the director’s chair. These are
even supplemented by reviews of their
two great additions to the festival, both
of which are on general release this
month.
Don’t think that sounds up to much?
Well don’t be so hasty, because the Fe-
lix Film team have managed to acquire
200 free tickets to a preview screening
of Into The Wild with details follow-
ing over the next few pages. As if that
wasn’t a good enough offer, we also got
in touch with Rough Guides to bring
you ANOTHER competition giving
you the chance to win a copy of the
new Rough Guide to Film. Just don’t
say that we never give you anything.
Finally, we’ve had word of a screen-
ing of the award-winning oil documen-
tary A Crude Awakening in the Renoir
Cinema in Brunswick Square at 1pm
on Sunday 4th Nov with discounted
access for Imperial students and staff
so be sure to check it out.
Maybe we’ve spoiled you just a tad
too much.
