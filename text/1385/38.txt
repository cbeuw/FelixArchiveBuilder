How to train the abs, Part II
Andy Mitchell
Energia Fitness Instructor
Sports league
Last week we looked at reasons not
to crunch. So, what exactly should
you be doing to train your abdominal
muscles?
When all is said and done, there are
certain times and certain reasons why
you would add crunches into your
workout, though these are generally
due to rehabilitation purposes. If hav-
ing read this you still insist on doing
crunches then at least do them on a
SwissBall rather than the floor and also
come and ask an Instructor how to
do the exercise properly, as I see very
few people in the gym performing the
technique correctly.
Leg-raises are also a problem abdom-
inal exercise, but are often performed
in the gym. Most people believe that
this exercise will work their lower abs
and this is true, as long as you perform
the exercise correctly. Unfortunately if
you go to the gym and observe most
people performing this exercise, they
are doing it incorrectly resulting in
them over exercising their hip flexors
(which can lead to lower back injuries)
and placing large amounts of pres-
sure on their lower backs. The lower
part of the rectus abdominis inserts
into the pubic bone of the pelvis and
does not connect to your legs. There-
fore swinging your legs up, down and
in any other direction, does not work
your lower abdominal muscles. The
only way you can exercise the lower
abs through the leg-raise exercise is
by maintaining a neutral pelvic posi-
tion (from activation of the lower abs)
against the pull of the hip flexors on
the lumbar spine (the origin of the hip
flexors). As I have said, from observing
people performing the leg-raise exer-
cise in the gym you can clearly see that
their lower backs are coming up off the
floor showing no sign of lower abdom-
inal activation. Furthermore, if you like
getting your mate to throw your legs
towards the floor to enhance the exer-
cise, you are only adding further pres-
sure to your lower back increasing the
risk of injury. Many people will claim
they can feel their abdominal muscles
working in this exercise, in most cases
it is the hip flexors that you can feel as
they originate from the lumber spine
below your abdominal muscles. Hav-
ing tested hundreds of people on this
exercise only about 1% has ever been
able to maintain neutral pelvic posi-
tion whilst slowly lowering their legs
down, let alone anyone who can do it
with a friend throwing the legs down!
If you would like to test the strength
(or sadly in most cases the weakness)
of your lower abdominals drop by the
gym and an Instructor will be able to
show you how strong they really are!
So what exercises should you be per-
forming in the gym to get functionally
strong abdominals? The oblique mus-
cles (the side of the stomach) are the
most used stomach muscles in every-
day life and sporting activities. There-
fore these should be trained more
often than the rectus abdominis. Exer-
cises such as Russian twists and wood-
chops are ideal ways of developing
strength and power in these muscles.
As I said earlier the rectus abdominis
is designed to work as a stabiliser of the
lumbo-pelvic region and so are actu-
ally best trained with an exercise such
as the plank (a great exercise but com-
monly performed incorrectly, again
see an Instructor to learn to do them
properly) or through other exercises
such as cleans, squats and deadlifts.
Explosive exercises using Medicine
balls and Tornado balls are also a great
way to develop strength and power in
all of the abdominal muscles.
Sadly there is not enough space to
write about all these exercises in detail
and this article only touches the sur-
face of an area of training that is highly
complex. Even to go into how many
repetitions and sets to perform would
take up a whole article! I can only sug-
gest that if you would like to know
more about abdominal training or ask
any questions related to this article you
come and see me some time on the
gym floor where I can go further into
the topic.
Week 4 and a lot more results are in,
most of which are wins.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) – (L*4).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year.
With this week’s results in, Netball
1sts are again top of the league, with
squash men’s 1st and tennis men’s 2nd
also winning their games. Football
Men’s 3rd and 2nd teams are having a
tough time tho, lying at the bottom.
