Logic Puzzle: Rugby match
Using the clues and logical deduc-
tion alone, work out how all the
people involved in the match relate
to each other. The puzzle can be
solved without guesswork. Make
use of the grid to cross off and tick
the combinations that you have
worked out.
Read through each clue and make
any obvious or stated
deductions. Find the
corresponding row
and column on the
grid and place a tick
for ‘Yes’ in the box,
and a cross for ‘No’ in
the cells next to this
one vertically and
horizontally.
Ensure that you read the clues care-
fully. They can sometimes reveal
multiple hints! Remember that
elimination of alternatives is a key
method. That is where the grid is so
important - it allows you to see the
possibilities left with ease.

1. The player with the odd-sized feet
was a prop. He isn’t Anjit, who was sin
binnned.
2. Anjit isn’t short ot squidgy. The
player who is tall and fleckled wasn’t
the hooker.
3. Owen wasn’t the prop and didn’t get
Man of the Match or Scare the Oppo-
sition like one of his teammates with
his amazing haircut.
4. The player who was squidgy didn’t
have a ball to the balls. Neither the
squidgy player or the tall, freckled
player was flanker.
5. The player who was Man of the
Match isn’t short or squidgy.
6. Joe (who isn’t squidgy or freckled)
scored a try.
7. The fly half was Luke, who wasn’t
squidgy or freckled either.
Slitherlink 1,385
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is simi-
lar to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw lines be-
tween the dots to create one long, and most
importantly, looping line. It should have no
start or finish; just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many lines
should be drawn around it, for example:
Cells which don’t contain a number can be
surrounded by any number of lines.
Remember, the line must form a loop, so
the line cannot branch. The following situa-
tions are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There are
never cells containing the number 4 in
Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most com-
mon place to start on a Slitherlink grid is by
drawing crosses around any zeros. Drawing
crosses is purely done to so that you know
where there can’t possibly be a line. So, take
the pattern below as an example. Begin by
drawing crosses, then by filling in some
lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the fol-
lowing directions:
Ha, ha! We’ve sprung a gigantic 10x10 on
you this week. Enjoy and keep linking!
