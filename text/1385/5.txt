Introducing canoe juggling
S
ome historic manuscripts
suggest that canoe juggling
started as early as 1737 in
a small rural town in south
Sweden, though the 1870
World Canoe Juggling Champion-
ships, at which 18 countries were rep-
resented, is recognized as the first of-
ficial contest by the Guinness Book of
Records.
Perhaps unsurprisingly the Swedes
dominated the championships, held
every three years, until the infamous
1888 championships in Budapest, at
which there was significant outcry
regarding cheating in the Lithuanian
and Paraguayan teams. The Swedes,
pulling rank having invented the sport,
required that the canoes be sea worthy
whilst the Lithuanians and Paraguay-
ans, entering the championships for
the first time had assumed the canoes
were simply aesthetic. Incidentally, the
Mexicans were disqualified outright
for using ‘canoes’ a mere two feet in
length, despite demonstrating their
skills with full size canoes at the previ-
ous WCJC. Thus began the standardi-
sation of the juggling canoe and the ad-
ditional requirement for teams to enter
a 100m sprint in a randomly selected
canoe.
Since those early days however, sig-
nificant advances have been made in
the sport. At the 2002 WCJC, 5 times
world champion Esben Krister as-
tounded judges with a 4 canoe ‘Mill’s
Mess’, whilst the runner up Rafael
Romero, an unlikely Mexican candi-
date standing only 5’ 3” tall, attempted
a 3 canoe ‘Rubenstein’s Revenge’. Sadly
Krister died in late 2005 of internal he-
morrhaging shortly after his seventh
WCJC victory in which he performed
an unimaginable 5 canoe half shower.
The Swedish team now wears spon-
sor’s logos to the value of £3.4 million;
a testament to the impact of the sport
on the world population despite its
dangers. Crazes have hit many schools,
particularly for one reason or another,
primary schools, though after numer-
ous reports of significant injury, death
and the Colchester incident of 1998, it
is now banned in most British educa-
tional establishments. If however you
are still interested in taking up the
sport professionally you might want to
think again.
Following the advances in material
technology most championship teams
now juggle carbon fibre or Kevlar ca-
noes, so a basic set of three canoes
will cost you about £4000. Practice
and budget canoes are however, avail-
able for a reasonable cost and canoe
juggling societies often provide rental
equipment for their members. The Ca-
noe Club here at Imperial can be seen
practicing the sport in front of Beit
quad on a regular basis, though they
are not very good at it.
Pspelling: The future of spelling
David Stewart
I
t is a continuing concern to the
British citizen that the auster-
ity of British English is being
eroded. More precisely, letters
are being lost from words. En-
cyclopædia has become encyclope-
dia. Diarrhoea has become diarrhea.
Through is often misrepresented as
thru. Clearly action must be taken un-
til we are left with words with no let-
ters remaining in them at all. By way
of demonstration, we include below an
artists impression of the word flocci-
naucinihilipilification in two hundred
years time:
fn
It is clear that we must not let such
a situation arise, for the benefit of our
children, and our children’s children,
who could find themselves recon-
structing polysyllabic words out of
single letters. As is well understood
in academic circles, it is impossible
to hold back progress; however, there
is something that can be done. Since
words are generally either shorted
from the middle, or the end, we pro-
pose the following strategy to conserve
word length: we must add new letters
on to the beginning of words. This way,
we may preserve their length.
We take inspiration from words of
already quite prodigious austerity. Psy-
chology, Psalm and Psalter are amongst
those we are interested in. The ‘p’ is in
each case not at all necessary to the
pronunciation of the word in question,
and so can reasonably be added to the
beginning without disturbing speech.
Below we include a table displaying a
selection of words as they stand and
the modified versions as we propose:
It is stressed that none of these words
will change in sound. This will facili-
tate the transition; those who are ad-
justing to the new system will be able
to have perfectly normal conversations
with those who have already adjusted
while those in the know will be aware
that they are adjoining ps to an ever
increasing quantity of the words they
use.
We have investigated many exten-
sions to this. Addition use of the p-
prefix can be motivated from ptero-
dactyl to yield such new words as ptick,
ptruck and ptoss-pot. Experimenting
with other words has also proved fruit-
ful. Gnome gives us gnut, gnever and
gnude. Knit additionally provides kn-
incompoop, knag and knude. Wrench
would suggest wrandom, wrickety
and wrollick. Moreover, what, why
and when imply modifications such as
Old Word
stupid
sick
scry
so
school
spoon
sun
shit
New Word
pstupid
psick
pscry
pso
pschool
pspoon
psun
pshit
whood, whinkie and whank.
When one drops the necessity for
inspiration from pre-existing English
words, one can make more creative
modifications. Garden could become
ngarden, kiddy-fiddler would be fkid-
dy-kfiddler, and cunt alters to rcunt.
As the degradation of words contin-
ues, it would be necessary to repeat
this procedure. We could imagine new
words such as pspspecial being neces-
sary, or gkpaper. In the example men-
tioned above, we can therefore predict
floccinaucinihipilification eventually
begin represented by qpygjncdrfn.
While personally we may find this
depiction of such an apocalyptic state
of affairs at best distressing, at worst,
sufficient to induce suicide, the des-
perate position we are put in by the
current degradation renders this pro-
cedure necessary. It will be a test of our
nation in the years to come, whether or
not we are able to live up to the chal-
lenge posed and relearn our pspelling.
T
he Ancient Greeks were
a remarkable bunch. I’ve
left that sentence on my
screen for the past three
days, and the more I look
at it, the more pathetic an understate-
ment it seems. A quick scroll through
Microsoft Office’s usually helpful the-
saurus shows how woefully inadequate
adjectives are in an attempt to describe
real, unparalleled genius.
Our Western society owes its very
existence to the Ancient Greeks, and
a list of all we have to be grateful for
would read like an encyclopaedia. Far
simpler to mention all those everyday
things that owe nothing to their re-
markable discoveries; a list which, over
the past few hours, I have been wholly
unable to make.
Where would we be, for instance,
without Hippocrates, father of mod-
ern medicine? Were it not for him, we
might never have come to realize that
our health is controlled by the balance
of our four humours (phlegm, yellow
bile, black bile and blood, for all you
non-medics out there). It was thanks
to this remarkable insight that doctors
through the ages knew to use leeches
in their practices; just imagine the suf-
fering that would have gone untreated
in the millennia since Ancient Greece
Gilead Amit
What the ancient Greeks did for us
had surgeons not known to bleed their
patients. It hardly bears considering!
Surely the most remarkable of their
contributions, however, were to the
field of science. Aristotle, perhaps the
greatest of his contemporaries, real-
ized without making a single obser-
vation that the Sun, planets and stars
all revolve around the Earth in perfect
circles. His model was later extended
to include Anaximander’s vision of the
Earth as a cylinder with a height equal
to one-third its diameter.
Though many scientists since have
attempted to claim his insights as their
own, Empedocles must remain the one
true father of elemental cosmogenesis
(a slightly more technical idea that im-
plies that the Universe is made up of
four distinct elements: earth, fire, wa-
ter and air). He and Ocellus Lucanus,
who first proposed that the Universe is
eternal, with no beginning or end, set
the framework for the next two thou-
sand years of research. I could go on
and on, but I think that my point needs
no further pressing: the science we
know, teach and learn today is almost
entirely based on the work of the An-
cient Greeks.
Of course, not all their ideas were
right. Heraclitus came to the laugh-
able conclusion that random chance
controls the workings of the Universe,
almost as if God played dice with the
Universe! His proposal goes hand in
hand with one of Anaximander’s less
brilliant ideas, that multiple universes
might exist in parallel, with differ-
ent futures being lived in each. Hip-
pasus of Metapontum dared to defy
the genius of Pythagoras by claiming
that the square root of 2 is irrational.
While some may claim that his being
drowned by his colleagues was a little
excessive, I think we can all agree he
was worthy of ridicule.
It is hard to reconcile the two aspects
of Greek society, where every idea,
both right and wrong, seems to have
seen daylight for the first time. It’s all
very well to be amazed at the farsight-
edness of some observations, but one
has to look at the other side of the coin,
and be equally amazed at their period-
ic myopia. Instead of praising them for
what they got right, or ridiculing them
for where they went wrong, we should
praise what really deserves praise – that
one civilization, in a few generations,
could come up with so many wildly
original, entirely heterogeneous ideas.
What will we be remembered for?
