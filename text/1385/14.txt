Those of you who were here last year
may recall that 12 months ago a rather
heated debate was being had as to
whether or not Imperial College Union
should affiliate to the National Union of
Students (NUS). After a hectic week of
campaigning from both sides the student
body narrowly voted for us to join again
after 30 years of not being members.
Both sides of this debate recognized
that the NUS requires significant reform.
No one here wants to pay £44,000 a
year to a basket case of an organisation
which is poorly managed and loses
money year after year, so the Union is
fully supportive of the attempts being
made by the current NUS sabbaticals to
remedy some of these problems.
At Council on Monday a motion was
passed mandating me to write to the
NUS President to add our name to the
list of Unions requesting an Extraordinary
Conference so that the new NUS
governance proposals can be passed
by the end of this academic year. The
motion passed can be found on the
Committees section of our website;
although there
was one minor
amendment made
to it.
I spent 2 days
last week at
a conference
in Coventry
discussing this
and I would
like to pass on the outcomes. The full
governance proposals are available in full
on the NUS website but in short they are
seeking to ensure that the organisation
is in future run on a professional basis.
If this reform process does not succeed
then it is unlikely that the NUS will have a
long term future or will have the benefits
of Imperial College Union’s membership.
I appreciate that governance is not the
most exciting topic but it is important
so if you have any views on the future
direction of the National Union of
Students then please pass them on so I
can communicate your concerns to their
leadership.
