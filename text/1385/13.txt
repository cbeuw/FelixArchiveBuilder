Trading is not just a numbers game
Over the past century trading has
evolved from being just a profession,
to a whole academic subject in its own
right. Louis Bachelier, a young mathe-
matician, was the first person to bridge
the gap between the two worlds that are
seemingly at odds. He achievied this by
publishing his “Theory of Speculation”
in 1900. Much theory now abounds
and many times it borrows ideas from
the most unlikely places. From phys-
ics and mathematics to what can only
be described as cheap mail-order psy-
chology courses.
Many speculators, good and bad
alike, have written extensively about
trading over the last century. The fa-
mous Jesse Livermore and the infa-
mous currency breaker extraordinaire,
George Soros, are perfect examples.
They have all shared some of their
views and doctrines on trading with
masses of eager, hungry, foolishly un-
educated buffoons.
None of their ideas are truly original
or propose the reader undergo radi-
cal changes of thought in an absolute
plan. It is however, quite interesting to
to see how they are metamorphosed
and adapted to the highly volatile com-
mercial plane – especially the financial
microcosm.
While most authors present relative-
ly different topics and ideas from one
another, each of their texts contains a
few links that connect their supposed
wisdom to someone else’s philosophy
– be it merely of speculation or life in
general. It is obviously possible to
extrapolate these beyond com-
mon sense and identify a
plethora of associations that
might not really be there in
the first place.
If, on the other hand, one
is familiar with some of the
more widespread ideas about
trading, one can quite eas-
ily synthesize and identify a
few key ideas, placing them un-
der four loose (almost esoteric)
headings:
• The relationship between
confidence and humility
• Self-perception
• Discipline and authority
and most importantly,
• The human condition
There is something to be
said about the attributes
of a good speculator.
No one trader will
have all the desir-
able traits for a

in the industry. It

ones and is

able to dominate and reduce exposure
to his weakest.
Confidence and humility
This is a relatively tricky one. Most
of the greatest traders of all time agree
that one of the main traits moulding a
good speculator, is a relatively high lev-
el of confidence, sprinkled with a good
dose of humility. By this, I mean hav-
ing the conviction of putting on a trade
and opening a position without the ar-
rogance of taking too much risk. This
is an idea that is seen in most trading
theories – either in an abstract way
where it is only implied, or in a more
narrative and pedagogical sense where
the author might tell a story of how a
grave lack of balance between hubris
and serenity has led to a devastating
loss. In a way, an excess of confidence
on the money manager’s part can be
seen where he/she is no longer curious
about every little detail of the trade. As
soon as all the questions cease, there is
a serious flaw in execution that will in
some way, lead to a loss.
Self-perception
Having a good idea of who we are, how
we work and what our strong and weak
points are, is absolutely vital for specu-
lation. It is postulated by a majority of
investors that beginning speculators
and trad- ers fail
and
suffer
mas-
sive losses
due to a lack
of self-knowl-
edge or an in-
credibly high
degree of dif-
ficulty in
accepting
character
flaws and
overcom-
ing these.
Trading
history tells
us the story of
countless trad-
ers who firmly
believe their gains
are a by-product
of their intelligence
exclusively and that
no external conditions
have come into play. This
completely alters their
behaviour and mindset
in the financial markets
and, thinking themselves
invincible, they almost inevi-
tably fall in a tragic manner,
worthy of an epic poem. A
reluctance of acceptance of
our relative inferiority to
almost perfectly behaving
markets leads to results
that fall short of most
expectations.
Discipline and
Authority
For exterior reasons,
most traders, even
successful ones have
discipline problems
and flaws. As long as
these issues are very
sporadic and some-
what minor, it is almost acceptable to
err; one does after all learn from mis-
takes. A grave lack of discipline how-
ever, will most likely lead to a down-
fall of character, or most importantly
in speculation, positive alpha. When
a speculator opens a position he/she
must know exactly why this is being
done. Many beginning traders howev-
er, seem to be completely disconnected
from this notion of discipline and seem
blinded by their own accidental suc-
cess. It is suggested by veterans that
newbies should take a relatively sys-
temic approach to their trading, where
their criterion are validated by more
than one metric.
Some traders are also of the camp
that one cannot do everything alone
and still beat the benchmarks and
hence, delegation of authority is a
must. This stems from a good manager
having the discipline to recognise that
human beings, while good at multi-
tasking, will over time have diminish-
ing returns if the work they do increas-
es almost exponentially. Success at this
stage depends on the choice of people
according to competencies.
The Human Condition
The most abstract idea is without a
doubtthemostwidespreadandprevail-
ing one in any theory of speculation. It
deals with the deepest emotions felt by
traders during market hours. Any spec-
ulator is almost completely overtaken
by the primordial emotions of fear and
greed. It makes for an interesting study
to observe the shifting focus of these
during the day, and what factors other
than market activity, make the balance
tilt from one end of the spectrum to
the other. A concept that is usually per-
ceived to have a negative influence on
human beings is that of social and peer
pressure. In the financial markets, this
becomes a very important part of per-
forming well. It is inevitable to bench-
mark oneself against a peer group. In
a strangely Darwinist survival-of-the-
fittest scenario when this group is do-
ing well as a whole, it is only normal
that one wants to perform at the same
level or better to everyone else.
And that is all that markets are about.
The perpetual quest to be the best; to
know you are on the winning side of a
trade; to know your view is superior to
that of a million other players; to assert
yourself as the leader of the pack.
Veni, vidi, vici... suckers.
