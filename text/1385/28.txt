So, here we have what is perhaps one of
the rarest phenomenons ever to come
out of Hollywood – an action thriller
with depth. Sure, the Bourne trilogy
had great introspective characters, but
this film deals with hard-hitting sub-
ject matter that genuinely hits closer
to home.
The film begins by showing the au-
dience a civilian compound in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, suddenly coming under
attack by suicide bombers under the
cover of the National Guard. With the
violence explicit and indiscriminate,
it left several poignant, horrifying im-
ages lingering around my mind for a
considerable duration of time.
Whenever US Citizens are killed
abroad, it apparently falls to the FBI to
investigate, and after getting past some
political bureaucracy, Jamie Foxx and
his small team of agents are dispatched
to the region.
Now, this could easily have been
another terrible jingoistic film involv-
ing American killing machines mow-
ing down the clear, definite enemy of
freedom, as it were, but fortunately,
and to be honest, surprisingly, it most
certainly isn’t.
With the Muslim characters in the
film getting as much screen time and
character development – perhaps
more so – than the American leads,
there is a clear push by the director to
emphasise the fact that despite distinct
cultural differences, we are all humans
in this world, and that anyone is capa-
ble of anything. A minor role in the
film encapsulates all the stereotypes
many people around the world hold
today, by expressing his views that the
entirety of a race and religious collec-
tive is responsible for the actions of the
few, and one that the film very success-
fully attempts to debunk.
Despite the political weight this
film carries, it never once attempts to
thrust it in your face; instead, it deli-
cately portrays a human drama unfold-
ing before your eyes, one that is both
thrilling and meaningful enough to
keep you hooked right until the clos-
ing credits.
It is labelled as an action thriller, so
do not go into the cinema expecting
a full, in-depth analysis of the current
situation on the so-called ‘war on ter-
ror’. I despise the view that a film can
either be an action flick or an intelli-
gent eye-opener, and this film exists to
throw out these archaic rules set down
by hundreds of draconian film critics.
The Kingdom is indubitably an eclec-
tic, pleasing mix of a thriller based on
current events, and it most certainly
handles everything intelligently. Noth-
ing seems out of place or biased. This
is a film about retribution, loss, and
showing that everyone, no matter what
age, race, or religion, is capable of evil.
Most of the action sequences occur
during the final third of the film, and by
this point you will find yourself almost
cheering on the US-Saudi team rapidly
gaining on the terrorists responsible
for the heinous crimes perpetuated a
few hours earlier. I genuinely wanted
an eye for an eye by this point – to see
those responsible killed in swift retri-
bution. This played into the film’s mor-
al core perfectly: essentially, what this
film aims to do is show the audience
that many people’s actions are based
on the most primal of instincts, and
in this sense the epilogue is as chilling
as the opening scene, with an all too
similar mentality being put forward by
both sides of the same coin, leaving the
audience with a provoking thought to
dwell on.
An excellent score and some terrific
leads – most notably the endearing
SaudipoliceofficerportrayedbyAshraf
Barhom – make this a film worth more
than the asking price. With no stupefy-

ing twists or unrealistic plot progres-
sion, it is entirely believable and is
something that no-one can justifiably
claim is offensive or Americanised.
So there you have it: an intelligently-
handled, emotionally in-depth thriller
that is not afraid to show you the dark
side of humanity and the cost of follow-
ing – and fighting against – extremism
in the world today. More than your av-
erage American thriller, no?
