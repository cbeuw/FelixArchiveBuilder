Imperial Team of the Week
This week, Sports Partnership along
with Felix Sport have chosen the
Rugby 1st team as Imperial’s Team
of the Week. The side pulled off a
nail biting 20 - 19 win over Hertford-
shire 1sts, who could have won it in
the last second had one of their Sa-
racens Academy players not missed
the penalty. Oh well!
Currently lying 2nd in their table,
they have won three out of their
four BUSA games and continued
their winning streak at home against
Portsmouth this week, with the final
score being a respectable 31-0. Full
match report can be found on page
36.
Well done lads and keep it up!
A new partnership has been formed
between Sport Imperial and Hyde
Park which allows all students and
staff at Imperial to benefit from dis-
counted rates for the tennis facili-
ties, with additional benefits such as
booking in advance and receiving
discounted rates at the on-site shop.
Aside from the benefits being of-
fered, this partnership has been ar-
ranged to allow our IC Tennis Teams
Alissa Ayling to play their BUSA fixtures on a
Wednesday afternoon within a short
walk from the college.
The courts are situated in Hyde
Park at the top of Exhibition Road
and also provide viewing facilities
for those who want to support Im-
perial in their BUSA competitions.
If you have any further questions
about the Hyde Park partnership

The Developing Excellence Scheme
(DES) aims to provide a range of
support mechanisms for our elite
athletes and to aid sporting develop-
ment whilst studying at Imperial.
The support is available to indi-
vidual athletes and teams. DES may
cover coaching, equipment, entry
fees, travel costs, support services,
nutrition, physiological testing and
more.
In 2006-07 DES made awards to
athletes across ten sports including
Ice Hockey, Tennis, Cross-country,
Fencing, Cricket, Sailing, Rugby and
Trampolining.
Support of up to £2,000 or the
equivalent in services, is available to
current Imperial students who;
• are performing to a high stand-

sport.

sions on awards will only be made at
the quarterly Panel Meetings. These
meetings normally take place in Au-

There is a story of a man who, when
charged with a crime he had commit-
ted some years ago, had as his defence
that since every cell in your body dies
and is replaced that he could not have
possibly been the same man he was
seven years ago and thus was not guilty
of the crime. While I’m not sure how
true the story is, it illustrates the point
that the body is continually undergo-
ing a process of cells dying and being
made
So what are we making these new
cells with? The stuff we eat everyday
of course!
The process of your body recover-
ing, repairing and getting fitter due to
your hard work in the gym will be sig-
nificantly increased by having the right
post workout meal – whether you’re
sweating it out on the treadmill, work-
ing ‘the guns’ in the free weights area
or working your ‘abs of steel’ on what
looks suspiciously like an old space
hopper, get the post workout meal
right and you’re onto a winner.
Before we get into the nuts and
bolts of the meal, let’s talk about sup-
plements. The use of supplements is
contained in the word – it should be
supplementing what you’re getting
from your food, not replacing it. So be-
fore you go spending your hard earned
student loans on the latest “evolution-
ary ionised whey protein with cell vo-
lumisation” have a look at what all your
meals of the day consist of. In most
cases once you create the right balance
with all your meals, you won’t have the
need for supplements. Remember you
can always ask the Energia gym team if
you are unsure.
The ratio and amount of macronu-
trients (carbohydrates, protein and
fat) in the after workout meal will dif-
fer according to what you have done
in that session, your lean body weight
and other variables but a good guide is
to have a 2: 1 ratio of carbohydrates to
protein.
What it all means
I’m a big advocate of making your
own post workout meal, whether that
be bringing it with you to eat after the
gym or going back to your digs and
rustling it up there and then. In addi-
tion to the meal being full of the right
things it also needs to be consumed
within an hour of your workout finish-
ing - your body is in need of that food
to start the recovery process so don’t
hang about! A good tip is when you
prepare your evening meal to make
double the amount of the meal you will
be eating so you can eat one lot then
and save the other for after your work-
out the next day, but remember not
two lots of curry and chips please!
Don’t stick to the same thing all the
time! Different foods have different
amounts of vitamins and minerals
necessary for recovery and growth so
change around the ingredients to op-
timise this. Below are two examples of
meals which would be good post work-
out meals enjoy!
Tuna sandwich
1 can of tuna
2-3 spoons of mayonnaise
4 slices of wholemeal bread
Spinach salad
Spinach leafs
Ham (both the spinach and ham are
chopped up)
Mushrooms
Tomatoes
(at the end of frying the mushrooms
you can add the spinach and ham for
a short while)
