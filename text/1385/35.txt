Pre-season training a hit
As many of you know, this year saw the
first Pre-season Training Week for the
sports clubs taking place from Monday
24 to Friday 28 September.
The week was set up to allow ACC
clubs the opportunity to get fit and
ready for the upcoming season after the
relaxing summer break. Approximate-
ly 65 people from different clubs such
as Rugby, Hockey, Netball, Volleyball,
Badminton and Swimming, signed up
for a week of gruelling circuits, agility
training, and sports specific warm-up
exercises, as set out by the Energia fit-
ness team.
The athletes were not only put
through their paces indoors at Ethos
with some tough circuit training but
outdoors too, in Hyde Park.
“As a first attempt at running a pro-
gramme of this type, the week was an
unprecedented success,” commented
Luke Taylor, ACC Chair. “The Train-
ing Week was a great inspiration for
the ACC clubs to adopt a more profes-
sional attitude to their sport, and also
to have a bit of fun before term started.
Hopefully for next year we can adjust
the content of the Training Week pro-
gram to better reflect what the sports
teams want to see included, but the
turnout of over 30 members from the
IC Rugby Club proves that there is the
desire in the ACC for something of this
sort to be offered to clubs.”
All in all this was a positive week for

those involved, as they have all start-
ed the season very well and are ben-
efitting from the time and energy they
spent in preparation for the start of the
competitive season. The results from
BUSA and ULU competitions over the
last 3 weeks have reflected their hard
work and determination.
The organisation, funding and prep-
aration for the week was a joint effort
by the ACC and Sport Imperial and as
a result has created some great links
between students and the Energia staff
in Ethos. This will no doubt benefit the
future development of sport at Impe-
rial and provide students with the op-
portunity to gain professional advice
throughout their university sporting
careers.
Running in Hyde Park, some of these girls really have a weird way of running

After last weeks impressive perform-
ance against Hertfordshire, Imperial
were ready to take on Portsmouth at
Harlington. Building on last weeks
performance, only one change was
made to the team.
The game started a little slowly for
Imperial’s liking, with the forwards
being shooved back a few times in the
scrums, however Portsmouth were un-
able to stop the free flowing style that
the 1sts also have. This became evident
when Flannan O’Maoney slid through
the defence and then off loaded the ball
the prop forward who gained 30 me-
ters before going to ground and win-
ning a penalty. Winger Rob Phillipps
happily went across the try line to give
Imperial the lead.
Portsmouth did not take to this too
well and their tempers started to fray
with late, high and dangerous tack-
les happening all over the place, and
eventually a fight. This only spurned
on the Imperial pack who turned over
a Portsmouth scrum which Joe Brown
pounced upon and scored a try, leaving
the score at 10 - 0 at half time.
In the second half, you could sense
that Imperial had a point to prove, and
they did. The forwards started to rum-
ble the ball, setting up rolling mauls
with Alex Johnstone and Tom Zeal
scoring a try from it. The backs were
running tremedous lines, especially
Tom Carroll, but it was Alex Johnstone
who charged down a kick and scored
another try, leaving the score at 31 - 0
at full time.
A tremendous performance from a
team who, according to the coach, still
haven’t gelled fully! Man of the Match
went to James Petit for his outstanding
performance, and Twat of the Match
went to Terry Addo for his camoe sec-
ond half appearance.
