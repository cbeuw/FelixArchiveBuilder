Sacrificial cheeseburger, my Lord?

y now we’ve all heard the
bad news – eating meat is
bad for the environment.
More bad news; it will never
be regulated enough to be
an expensive preserve of the wealthy.
Yet more we are too disenchanted
these days to sanctify livestock and in-
fuse them with holy spirits, which is a
shame. This would have been the obvi-
ous solution for most of human history
and effective too, as it harnesses a total
belief system of the sort we evolved to
live with. Chronic meat shortage has
played a fascinating role in shaping
some of the more bizarre religious be-
liefs. Hopefully we can avoid the expe-
rience of Ancient Mexico where, lack-
ing the large game of Africa and Asia,
meat became exclusive to the ruling
Aztec classes whilst at times common-
ers had to make do with the spirulina-
algaeskimmedfromLakeTexcoco.The
solution was to cannibalise the victims
of human sacrifice – as many as fifteen
thousand people per year. The priest-
hood said that human sacrifice was
approved by the high gods, and
they sanctified it with elaborate
rituals performed amid statu-
ary of the gods on imposing
white temples.
So let’s do a little experiment
on ourselves. Say somebody is
suggesting you eat less meat,
how does this make you feel?
Self righteous like you would need
acknowledgement? And if nobody
would ever know your choice? Like
you want to rebel and have more
for yourself because you feel you
deserve it as you are a winner?
Irrespective of how we consciously or
sub-consciously justify it to ourselves,
somewhere in that psychology is what
is known as the Tragedy of the Com-
In light of the increasing awareness of the meat industry’s bad environmental credentials, Noel Forrest
explores the virtues of meat and dairy-free eating. Be warned, this article contains cannibalism
This is a cracking recipe that gives a
far-better sauce for pasta then any-
thing bought ready made.
Cheese = cows = methane = 23
times worse than carbon dioxide…
but what about the farmers?
Optional cheese topping, let’s say.
1. Get a good glug of olive oil in a
moderately heated saucepan.
2. Throw in two roughly chopped
cloves of garlic (flattening them with
a knife blade makes peeling easier).
Let them sizzle briefly, but just as
theystarttobecomecolouredbrown,
pour in Italian tinned chopped to-
matoes (one tin for two people
with pasta), a generous handful of
chopped parsley, salt and pepper.
3. Simmer it for 15 minutes and
you’ll end with a rich and thick sauce
that clings well to pasta.
4. Finish it with another glug of olive
oil, off the heat.
If you’re having with spaghetti,
best get the sauce going first, and
then they’ll be ready together.

mons. Because the costs of your ac-
tions are diffuse and spread across
many others (i.e. the negative impacts
of climate change, mainly affecting the
poor) but the benefits of your actions
are personal, people decide to overuse
resources to the
point of
collapse.

Some vegetarian recipes to cleanse your meat-riddled conscience
This looks like an exact recipe but
almost any veg will do, and the cous
cous does not need to be so fancy.
500g cous cous
750 ml boiling water
1/2 tsp bouillon powder (or crushed
stock cube)
1tbsp oliveoil
1 onion diced
1 tsp mustard seeds
1 garlic clove crushed
salt and pepper
1 red pepper cut into 6
1 yellow pepper cut into 6
1 bulb fennel cut into 6
2 med courgettes cut into 5 cm chunks
on diagonal
3 red onions peeled ,cut into 6
2 med aubergines cut into 5cm
chunks
4 tbsp olive oil
dash tabasco
1tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 clove garlic crushed
salt and pepper
1. Heat oven to highest setting.
2. Place the cous-cous in large pan and
pour over boiling water and bouillon
powder. The cous-cous will be soft
as soon as all the water has been ab-
sorbed (follow the instructions on the
packet if you’re unsure).
3. Meanwhile heat oil and fry the on-
ions until golden brown. Add mustard
seeds, crushed garlic, salt and pepper.
Mix with the cous-cous and set aside.

cal sense it might make to say, “sod
it let’s just enjoy the moment”, it’s far
more profound to appreciate that it
is our programmed human nature to
think in this way. With apologies to
the academic disciplines skipped
genetic heritage when you ask why we
do anything we do in the first place.
Seeking status and having children,
sport, religion, altruism, aggression,
phobias, all our most intense emo-
tions… in my opinion our lives are
screaming out our evolutionary his-
tory and it gives me a huge kick to see
that so clearly, when I know that others
don’t.
As a minor aside, am I really the only
one with an internal dialogue of con-
stant judgment? I would go so far as to
say that it is basically what it means to
be a human – expressionlessly choos-
ing the best course of action, while our
minds are swirling though various op-
tions and calculating the self-interest
factor. A human face is a poker face
– we do or say one thing, and think
something completely different. I say
that we are selfish, no matter how we
justify it to ourselves or what we think
of ourselves, and reason follows pas-
sion anyway.
Of course we shouldn’t fight this, as
it is our nature, and we have nowhere
else to go, but how can we break that
circularity for the necessary preserva-
tion of our environment? Maybe that’s
why government regulation needs to
play a part – but that’s short sighted
too through the four-year term system
which forces excessive voter pander-
ing. In my view, the answer is tribal-
ism. We need to recapture those spirits
in a system of branding and labelling
upon which, as a group, we can heap
moral significance and push the con-
formity onwards, providing that ac-
knowledgement and recognition we
all seek. What about corruption? Can’t
we design a system around that? It’s
not enough to rely on good people, we
know people are conniving and deceit-
ful (sorry to say!) so we need it to be
acceptable to check our neighbours
are in line if we all did this it would be
fine. Why isn’t it acceptable for us all
to invade our neighbours’ privacy and
check they’re not making bombs in
their attics? That’s a pretty dark ques-
tion in my view, and an important one
too.
Well actually, there is one place
where it happens every day and it’s also
the place where most meat is bought.
It’s the supermarket. Oh, how the
housewife frets over her see-through
basket! Are those chocolate biscuits
peeking out between the wires just too
naughty? Should I have really gone for
organic muesli? It’s the perfect exam-
ple! And Grannies are the exception
that proves the rule. They’ve garnered
respect and so can get away with their
tartan fabric trolleys, and fill them up
with dog food and hairspray. But here’s
my point: we need more see-through
baskets in our lives and we need to be
seen to be putting the right things in
them. Follow some of the meat-free
recipes on this page and you’ll be on
the right track, plus you won’t have
to eat dog food; for while this may be
equally cost-effective, I fear it may also
explain a fair portion of all those tartan
trolleys.
“The solution
to chronic meat
shortage was to

victims of human
sacrifice”
in between, our
moral compass is
short-sightedinthe
self interest of our
genes. We only tend
to look a few genera-
tions into the future (before
our own genome will become
fragmented in successive halv-
ings) and we make selective altruism
towards our closest kin, with whom
we share most genes (I’m thinking of
Christmas presents), or make altruism
in expectation of reciprocation.
It’s easy to see the relevance of our
4. For the roasted veg, mix all the veg
with olive oil, tabasco, balsamic vin-
egar, garlic and salt and pepper and
place in an oven-proof dish. Bake in
preheated oven for 35 mins or until
charred and tender. Serve piled on
the cous-cous.
5. To finish, garnish with a sprinkle
of chopped mint or coriander if you
fancy.
