Dear Sir. I hope that it is possible
to print this letter even though it
doesn't argue the merits of
abortion, homosexuality, sexual
discrimination or the bible.
I would like to reassure
members of the R S M Hockey-
Team, especially Steve Gatley
(who is next year's captain), that
my sylph-like frame will not be
leading them into battle on the
green and pleasant land of
Harlington. I will, however, try to
maintain the superiority of Mines
Newsletter over Gluidsheet and
Bedsheet in my capacity as
Editor.
I admit I wrote the R S M aticle
in the 1st J u n e issue but. unlike
someone on the staff of F E L I X , I
got it right.
Cheers,
Bob Holding

D e a r Sir, - I would like to
comment on a couple of points in
M i k e Elkin's letter of last week
concerning insurance in student
residences.
I do not feel that publicising
changes of policy in F E L I X is
sufficient as one cannot guarantee
that everyone gets a copy. H a l l
and House Wardens should have
been informed directly, by the
U n i o n , as it is the U n i o n who
holds the policy.
M r E l k i n states 7 would have
informed the Wardens ... except that I
thought Residence Office would do
that.' H o w was the Residence
Office supposed to find out about
it? D i d the U n i o n inform that
Office? - I think not.
Surely members of the U n i o n
Office have the ability to
communicate directly with the
Wadens and M r E l k i n should not
'pass the buck' of his own
negligence onto persons not
concerned in the matter.
H e also points out that the new
p o l i c y w o u l d n o t c o v e r
replacement value. However,
under that scheme M r Bambridge
would certainly have recovered
more than the 30% of his loss that
he has now received.
Yours sincerely,
Sue Kalicinski,
Warden, Southwell House.
Dear Sir, - O n the 17th of M a y ,
the IC India Soc held its A G M to
elect a new president for the
coming year. There were two
candidates for the post, M r
Chakravarty (Mech Eng) and M r
Satinder Purewal (Chem Eng).
T h e election was preceded by the
candidates making the usual
sincere blah-blah. M r C h a k r a -
varty pointed to his wide
experience in this sort of thing
while M r Satinder Purewal did a
lot of handwaving and said
nothing in particular. Election
was by a show of hands and M r
Gujral (Chem), the outgoing
secretary, did the counting. The
result was a win for M r
Chakravarty by three votes.
It now seems that M r Satinder
Purewal is suffering from lack of
sleep over the result; he is reliably

The latest is that M r Satinder
Purewal lias been fervently trying

Dear J o h n , - I feel I must correct
the errors in the letter from
Richard Archer in last week's
F E L I X regarding a news item the
previous week a b o u t R C S
Smoking Concert.
Firstly, the report did not say
that the motion had mentioned
the stripper. However Chris Fox
said that the motion passed would
almost certainly result in the
dropping of the stripper and the
report highlighted this.
Secondly, M r Archer said he
would like the chance to explain
why the name of Smoking
Concert will be changed to the
'Head lights Revue'. Unfortun-
ately readers must r e m a i n
u n e n l i g h t e n e d as he o n l y
proceeds to explain why it will no
l o n g e r be c a l l e d S m o k i n g
Concert.
Thirdly, it was Chris Fox who
r e f e r r e d to u n d e m o c r a t i c
minorities in answer to a question
as to whether the change had
come about because of protests by
women. I do not see how M r
Archer can say that M r Fox
meant something different to
what he said, and it is surely clear
from M r Fox's answer as reported
that he was referring to the
women making the protests and
not to any others. T o my
knowledge nobody other than
Rich Archer has considered that
M r Fox might have meant all
women.
As for his statement about 'those
people who go to Smoking Concert to
disrupt and drink the free beer' it
would be interesting to know to
whom he is referring. Those who
protested outside the Concert
firstly did not get any free beer,
and secondly were not disruptive,
their protest consisting of holding
placards, handing out leaflets and
peacefully trying to persuade
people not to go in.
Those who got free beer had to
have been legitimately inside the
Concert, in other words they had
b o u g h t a t i c k e t or w e r e
performers. They were therefore
as entitled to the free beer as
anyone else.
I personally was not aware of
a n y d i s r u p t i v e a c t i o n by
protesters either inside or outside
t h e C o n c e r t . T h e y o n l y
disruption which occurred came
from some members of the
audience who were not prepared
even to start listening lo the
Executive sketch.
Yours sincerely,
Sonia Hochfelder
