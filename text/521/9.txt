andthegraduate.
Views about industry, especially among graduates and others not actually engaged in it,
have a tendency to be both dramatic and odd. For example:
S C E N E : Back m the Manager's Office after a special meeting
L "Braithwaite, as your depart-
I man head I wain to tell you
â„¢ that my colleagues and I were
very proudof the way i u which
you stood up to the Director
this morning. It takes courage
andconfidence to tell the lead-
er that his facts are wronqand his
conclusion illogical, and I must tell
you that we were all extremely
impressed by your-own incisive
grasp of the factors involved.
It's that kind of fearless, clear-
headed thinking that renews tin
faith of all of us old hands in the
up-and-cominggeneration. In
the final analysis, it is not too
much to say, that your kind
of new approach makes all
the difference between
success and failure in tin
intensely cut-throat world
of business.
I am sure that your next
employer will appreciate it
to the full."
