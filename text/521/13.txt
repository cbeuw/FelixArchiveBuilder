ICRICKET
Rain Saves UC
U C 213 all out
IC 91 for 2
The remains of the selected IC lst X I numbered 5 and
arrived for U C ' s bus at Gower St with the news that they
wished to borrow the home sides kit.
O n arrival at Shenley we were lent 2 second X I players plus I
rabbit.
IC lost the toss and opened the bowling with 2 iirst change bowlers.
Wickets fell intermittently until at 150 for 4 Furnish made the astute
decision of putting on Mahers who immediately took a wicket. H a d he
been a real tactician he would then have removed Mahers from the
attack as 26 were taken from his second (final) over.
U C eventually made 231 with the help o f a non run out decision to
give them their last 15.
IC's 7 players included 5
opening batsmen and M y l v a -
ganam and A Guest were chosen
to do the honours. These 2 gave
IC a solid start until A Guest fell
to a bad decision from umpire
A . N . Otherguest.
This brought Davis to the
crease. The opposing captain
thought that this pair were bad
enough to get out to some slow
near donkey droppers. Davis and
M y l v a g a n a m thought otherwise
and proceeded to carve the
bowling until a proper spinner
was brought into the attack to
remove M y l v a g a n a m .
Davis continued to strike
fiercely until torrential rain
stopped him (on 47 n.o.) from his
50 and prevented fourth opener
Furnish (8n.o.) from his second
advent into double figures this
season.
At 91 for 2 off 17 overs and with
19 overs remaining it was
generally agreed that with these
two fine batsmen at the crease it
was only rain that saved U C .
T o decide the drawn match
U C challenged IC to a boat race
in the bar afterwards which we
won in style, (you try boat-racing
with Abbot ale).
Team: Furnish, Mylvaganam,
Turner, Davis, Mahers, A Guest, AN
Otherguest.
TENNIS CLUB
On Saturday, IC tennis were due to play a men's doubles against
Gower and a mixed against International Student House.
On Friday, O'Boyle was in the bar unaware of what lay in store.
Morning came and a dozen racquet-wielding hopefuls crowded in GCP
and sped towards Harlington. Sean and Julia who had hogged the front
seat payed dearly for it by sticking most uncomfortably (to the seats).
After a 5 minute delay, changing rooms were located and one of the
team waltzed out in tennis shorts a la RCS AGM, the latest thing so I'm
told. The rest of the players dressed some what more sedately knocked
up.
In due course the opposition arrived:
'How d'you do?'
'Fine thanks mate, how do you?'
'Nice weather for it.'
'Probably piss down later'
The courts themselves were in fairly good shape, if a bit slow, it had
been raining earlier on. Rich Jenner, last year's captain turned up late,
the team was complete. The match started.
'These two don't look much good'.
'Naa probably thrash 'em'.
1st round finished.
'Better than they looked weren't they?'
'Not bad at all'.
'Perhaps the others won'
'No we got hammered, bet you beat their third pair though, didn't look
much good'
O'Boyle and Jenner exchanged withering glances. And so it went. A
break for tea. Perhaps they'll slow up a bit after tea, flash gits, mused IC
to themselves over sticky chocolate biscuits and tomato sarnies.
3rd round after tea: no change, but with truegrit I C d i d manage to win
the odd game or two.
The mixed didn't fair much better; they could hardly have done worse!

IC 1st IX vs Westfield 1st XI
In the absence of M e l Kinkie this week, IC could only raise
nine perverts.
Toplis, still wearing his wellies after a h a r d m o r n i n g on the
sheep f a r m , managed to lose the toss again. Westfield elected
to bat which left IC to chase around in the tropical heat.
Toplis ignored Morton's advice to bow) his off-breaks and bowled bis
normal straight up and down rubbish. Somehow he managed to take 5
for 22 and this included a splendid catch behind the wicket by M o r t o n .
This surprised everybody as M o r t o n had spent most ofthe afternoon
lusting after women footballers in tight shorts, white socks and P Y C
shirts.
Ellacott claimed to have a
head-ache. This had two effects -
firstly he was unavailable to the
rest of the team and secondly he
only managed to bowl one
straight ball all afternoon. The
straight ball so surprised the
batsman it claimed Ellacott's only
wicket. M y l v a g a n a m and Slator
downed their whips and turned
their arms over. Both were
successful by their n o r m a l
standards returning figures of 1-
29 and 1-27 respectively. A s .
usual, IC used one joke bowler.
Today was the turn of Acford who
is due to appear in court next
week charged with exposing
himself in Hyde Park. Westfield,
with no perversions amongst the
whole team, finally declared after
tea at 122 for 9.
M o r t o n and M y l v a g a n a m
opened for IC. The latter looked
quite classy until playing on a
wide ball after scoring 28. M o r t o n
showed an uncharacteristic lack
of talent and scratched around for
a lucky 14. Furnish did not last
long as he was distracted by a
passing school-girl. However he
did improve his batting average
by scoring one run. Pickles
remained at the wicket for al least
two minutes and was given out for
self abuse when he had scored 9.
Slator looked like swinging the
game IC's way by scoring 0.
Toplis (still in his wellies) scored
an agricultural 10. and Mahers
(inspired the night before by his
i n f l a t a b l e r u b b e r w o m a n )
achieved a life-long ambition and
actually scored some runs. H e had
reached the amazing total ol 3
before a harsh umpiring decision
sent him back to the pavilion.
This left Acford and Ellacott
(complete with headache) to try
and play out the last few overs.
Acford's forward defensive lunge
was very prominent and he
remained not out 1. It was
Ellacott who generously dollied a
catch to short extra-cover oil the
penultimate ball of the day to
lose us the match. IC finished
with the impressive total of 79 and
two rape victims.
After the match we could at
least enjoy dirty films and an orgy
in the bar, even though we had
been defeated by eleven straight
men.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE
CROQUET CLUB
The croquet season has
begun. That's why you may have
s e e n i d l e p e o p l e h i t t i n g
multicoloured balls around the
Queen's lawn to no apparent
purpose. We are the IC Croquet
Club. Actually Croquet is a game
r e q u i r i n g skill, finesse a n d
t h o u g h t a n d n o t a l i t t l e
deviousness.
If you think you might like to
play, why not come along to an
i n t r o d u c t o r y s e s s i o n f o r
beginners at 1pm on Wednesday
13th June beneath the Queen's
Tower, where our resident expert,
Prof Neal will demonstrate the
basics of the game.
For those of you who already
play, and would like to join the
club (you need to be a member of
use the equipment) the man to
contact is Julian Radowicz, Maths
II. Come along on Wednesday,
anyway, and meet us.
After being accosted in bar afterwards and relentlessly teased all the
way back, (we only won 2 games all afternoon) I was quite glad to get
down to some Fluid mechanics revision, which I probably failed
anyway.
There's always next time.
Team: Barry Witts (Capt) Noori, Sean and Rich, Larry and Sydney.
Mixed: Julia and Richard, Sara and ?, Hazel and Rob.
