elsewhere.

c a m e .
' A n d to think I left my children for you!' At
this Sue ran out of the room, momentarily
forgetting the pain her stomach.
Halfway down the stairs, she doubled up in
pain. It was funny, though. She had come to
associate it with her children. She saw it as a
kind of punishment for abandoning them.
A n d how querulous Peter had become!
Lately, she had been repelled by his very-
touch ... it felt like an icy wind. If only V i r g i l
would have her back. Earlier in the day,
when they had met so providentially in the
street, she and V i r g i l had discussed the
possibility of a reconciliation, though only
briefly.
After a while, someone passed her on the
stairs, and helped her to her feet.
As she reached the foyer, she sat down by
the manager's office to await the 'phone call.
A t that moment, V i r g i l came striding in
through the door. Although he lacked a
certain air ol sophistication, a certain
gentlemanly grace, his swave appearance
and athletic physique made him glow with a
masculine prowess Susan admired in men.
T h e first thing she wanted to now was where
the children were.
'I left them in the hotel ... have you ever
seen a Greek baby-sitter:1
M i n d you, they
can't all be like her. She must weigh over
seventeen stone, the folds of flesh around her
belly are like the waves of the Aegean on a
stormy day.' Susan laughed: Virgil's
bubbling humour and nonchalant manner
was like a cool, refreshing breeze on a hot
summers day. H o w different il was to Peter's
crass intellectualism, and the assault of his
barbed innuendos. She pressed his hand in
hers, and kissed him lightly on the lips.
V i r g i l ordered some ouzo and water. The
conversation flowed. They spoke of past
regrets and future hopes. It wasn't long
before Susan broached the subject which was
uppermost in her mind.
Upstairs, Peter was pacing the floor with
the impatience of a lion at feeding time. Life is
so ironical, he thought to himself. If only
Susan had told h i m that he was Augustine's
father before she had announced her false
pregnancy to him, ... he would never have
b e e n m o t i v a t e d to act w i t h s u c h
vindictiveness, and the whole rueful episode
with L u c y never have transpired. As soon as
they returned to L o n d o n , he would begin
legal proceedings to gain the custody of his
daughter Augustine. T h e n he wondered if
V i r g i l knew.
W h a t was he up to, anyway?
After a prolonged discussion, Susan and
V i r g i l had reached agreement. She had
assured her ex-husband that she was willing
to forsake Peter, and return to V i r g i l for the
love she now realised that she had never lost
for him. Secretly, they planned an absurd
elopement. That same night, V i r g i l was
leaving with J a d e and Augustine for
Kusadasi, a resort on the T u r k i s h coast. They
were to meet on the quayside at ten o'clock.
T h e n again, Peter mused, perhaps Susan
was lying to him. T h e n what? Yet deep in
himself, he felt a trust for her which bordered
on devotion. She would always stay with him,
through the direst misfortunes, just as he had
unselfishly given her his moral support
during and after the operation. H e was
genuinely shocked and hurt by her vicious
outburst. H e sorely regretted losing his
temper in the first place. W h e n he had time,
he would apologise to her. But look at the
time! T h e telephone call should have come
an hour ago. Peter decided to go downstairs.
By the time Peter arrived, in the foyer,
V i r g i l had departed. H e had so m u c h that he
wished to discuss with his wife, that all he
could ask her was whether the children had
come yet. Without batting an eyelid, Susan
replied that she had telephoned V i r g i l and
suggested that he postponed his visit until
another day.
Just then, the manager beckoned them
into his office. In fact, the caller was Peter's
brother A l a n . D u r i n g the course of the
conversation, Peter, in his usual reticent
manner, said very little. Absorbed with
romantic thoughts, Susan didn't notice the
colour suddenly drain from Peter's face. He
replaced the phone, staring vacantly into
nothingness.
'What's the matter? Peter, tell me; you
look as if you've seen a ghost.'
' H e said it was a sudden stroke ...
unforseeable' Peter covered his face with his
hands, trying desparately not to weep. Susan
put her a r m round h i m a n d begged him to tell
her what had happened.
' M y father is dead!'
' O h ! N o ! '
' M y brother has booked us a return flight
.from Athens leaving tomorrow. I'm sorry,
Susan,' Peter continued, wiping away a lone
tear.
'So a m I, Peter. So a m I.'
