BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER
Wednesday, 13th is Snooker Club
Day!
On Wednesday, 13th June, at
1pm in the snooker lounge, the
new committee will hold its first
meeting (open to ordinary
members). We will be discussing
next year's plans, and if you have
any ideas, we will be only too glad
to hear them (after all, the new
booking system was the brain-
child of Kit Nair, who is not a
committee member, and it is the
best thing to happen in the
snooker club for a long time!)
In the evening, there will be the
first snooker club bar-night! Meet
in Union Bar at 7pm.
So make a point to come along
to at least one of the above events.
The new committee (cordially
known as pitch black and the
seven twats) are:
President: Me. the tinted one as
Maghar puts it,
Vice-President: Martin (leaning-
tower of Pisa) Proudiove (who
loves ya, Tracy)
Hon Sec : Steve (You've got
strong hands, haven't you Alex)
Jeans, who has astounded us all
by swearing the most since he was
elected,
Treasurer: Dave (Nuts) Nuttall.
Everyone's a fruit and nuttal case.
Publicity Officer: Gareth Machin,
but we all call him machine.
Ordinary Committee Members :
Geoff Keymer, our hero, Chris
Calvert, who keeps us all sane &
level-headed by his calmness
(even if he does have a funny
accent), Alice Cameron: Alice is
tall, blond, blue-eyed Quote: Why
dont you come up and see me
sometime?"
So these are the loonies who are
running the club. We're all very
approachable (don't take that in
the wrong sense), and we are here
to serve you.
Sanjit Teelock
(President for life)
Which might not be very long
after this article.
Gaysoc
W i t h the considerable oppression o f gays i n society a n d the
law a n d the continuous misrepresentation of gays i n the m e d i a
and education it is likely that m a n y people who are really gay
w i l l never realise themselves or only after they have other
c o m m i t m e n t s , eg marriage, children, etc, leading to
considerable conflict a n d misery.
Please think about the following points
(1) Although it is likely that a sexual preference is established early in
life, there is no evidence that this preference can be permanently
changed by heterosexual or homosexual experiences, eg why are there
so many married gays who only realised their true nature after
marrying. Do not lie afraid of suddenly being fixed as gay - it's just a
myth to try to frighten bisexual and gay people into conforming by
suppressing their true nature.
(2) The Christian Churches are by no means convinced of their
attitude towards gay people; Catholic, Methodist and C. of E.
Churches are all holding considerable investigations to try to
understand the situation of gays in their respective churches. Indeed
over 40 clergymen have signed a petition specifically repudiating the
masquerade of anti-homosexual prejudice as Christian morality.
(3) The stereotypes of gays spread by the media are completely false;
gays have the same spread of personality and jobs as heterosexuals, and
it is certain that you have met many gay men and women without even
realising it.
(4) Involving yourself by coming along to a gay organisation, eg.
U L U discussion groups, requires no commitment whatever, you come
along just as an observer. You can involve yourself as much or as little as
you like - it is entirely up to you.

SOCIAL EVENTS
A bar night held in Stan's real ale bar last Thursday evening was very
successful with a large attendance.
The new Committee will be organising a trip to Cambridge probably
on Thursday 19th July. The local beer festival starts on 19th July- what a
coincidence! Last year's trip was definitely not to be missed and proved
a welcome relief from the worries of thesis writing. Further details will be
available soon from the new Committee.
