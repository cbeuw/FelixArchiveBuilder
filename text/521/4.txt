W l j a t MEET ANNE TURNBULL:
IPs SOCIAL SECRETARY
Hello, I a m Anne T u r n b u l l ,
aged 19, a n d the new Social
S e c r e t a r y l o r t h e I n s t i t u t
Francais.
Reading the local newspaper
over the Bank Holiday at home I
came across an article on a court
case which rather amused me. A
nineteen year o l d , h a v i n g
committed a series of robberies in
Bosham, West Sussex, my home
village, was being questioned on
his latest attempt. T h e evidence ol
the prosecutor had already been
given, describing the arrest oi the
culprit. A man and wife had been
asleep upstairs when the wile was
awoken by strange noises below.
She then heard someone coming
up the stairs, and being somewhat
forceful a n d unflappable she sat
up in bed and called out "who's |HHHH
there?". W h e n the accused was
asked to give his evidence he
admitted his guilt. A t this point
the judge asked his reaction on
hearing someone shout out from
the bedroom.
"I couldn't believe it. I jumped
out of my skin. O n hearing the
woman shout at her husband to
chase me I dropped everything
and ran like a rabbit down the
stairs and out into the road." H e
was fined a considerable sum of
money.
As social secretary I would like
to break up the apathy at IF and
increase the number of active
members of the college. Being
S o c i a l S e c r e t a r y o i l e r s a
particularly good chance to do
this.
I, myself, being conveniently
situated in South Kensington, in a
hostel where I am not quite under
lock and key, enjoy a good social
life, and I would like to see a good
deal more social events organised
at IF. I enjoy parties, going to the
theatre or concerts, classical or
Otherwise, films, and particularly
sailing and playing the piano.
H o p i n g to see some of you
down at 13a C r o m w e l l Mews, lots
of love, A n n e x x x

This is one o f the disadvantages of
being elected F E L I X Editor before the
end o f session. Y o u see that funny guy
with the permanent leer who seems to
grow out o f the paste-up b o a r d on the
right, was getting worried. It was only
five hours to copy deadline time and no-
one h a d submitted any m o r e than a
filled i n What's O n f o r m and a creased
exam paper.
I was sitting over a meal of pie and hall
baked chips m u n c h i n g a paper cup when my
dream world of account books and cleaning
loam was destroyed by the words, ' H o w do
you fancy I looked up ... 'writing an
Editorial this week? Y o u can have a whole
page if you like.'
N o r m a l l y I would have j u m p e d at the
chance; w h o wouldn't? (shutup and read!)
Today was different. Today I had just walked
out of'an extremely exhausting exam, yes you
know what I mean, a n d I just did not exist.
T h e strange thing is here I a m writing
about why I wasn't going to write what I'm
writing.
Lots of people seem to be asking me lots of
questions. This doesn't often happen to me so
I've been a bit slow to realize just whafs going
on. I gather that some of you understand I am
producing F E L I X next year, and organising
all your posters a n d party tickets etc. O f
course you wish to know when my copy
deadlines are and il you can break them. I do
not yet know if it is going to be possible to
mail a F E L I X to prospective Freshers and
whether I can produce one if it is, but if I do
then I will only include copy in my possession
by 5.30pm on M o n d a y 23rd July. C o p y for
the Freshers Issue, which will appear on 1st
October, should be in bv 5.30 Friday Sept.
21st.
I must warn anyone that calling me nasty
names behind my back wont make me any
more flexible than I chose, which is not very.
While I'm warning people - If you want
posters done lor Freshers' Fair then I advise
you to get the artwork in as soon as possible. If
you come in the week before term starts I can
oiler no guarantee that the work will be
completed i n time.
Just before you all write me poison-pen
letters. I had better make m y peace. There
will be a new Cartoon Book on sale next term.
Drake's 7. the strip which [proved so popular
this year, is going to the presses in book form
with a completely new and original story i n
which o u r heroes travel ....enough said.
Some of you who are societies in disguise
will have received bills for litho work which
you have not payed for yet. If you do not
believe this come and see either me or the
other funny bloke a n d explain why you
distrust o u r accounting. I have very much
appreciated everyone who has co-operated so
far. I a m sorry to say that the unit is not
available to anyone who owes us money and
has not come forward.
Summer time is nearly with us again when
some of you will be thinking about getting
bound editions of F E L I X . If you haveasetof
this year's paper w h y not fork out the
extortionate sum of money that we must
necessarily charge and have them bound into
a nice thick, black and heavy volume that is
ideal for keeping all those pretty coloured
covers nice a n d clean. M o r e details of this
next week, ii John's short of copy again.
Publications board just managed to ratify
the eight lesser-spotted Committee members
and for those of you with short memories: if
you wish to take exotic photographs for
F E L I X next year get in touch with Ian
Prosser in the C h e m E n g exam. ' E r i c ' J a r v i s
is not only Phoenix Editor but F E L I X News
Reporter (confusing isn't it?) If you're into
social events make a date with J i l l Dawson
who stars on page 5 (The one on the left) and
help her organise something, somewhere,
sometime. M a n of all seasons and also heading
Page 5 M r C o l i n 'Feather Duster' Palmer is
looking after the media bother in College and
around the other L o n d o n slums. Lars
Wernburg-Meller is still trying to teach me to
spell his name when he takes time oil" from
being F E L I X H o n Sec. Ian Alvey runs the
sport section and M a r k Smith makes sure
we're all kept up to date with reviews and
reviewers.
This only leaves me to mention Dave
H a d d o n who does more than he has to, and is
our extra O r d i n a r y Member.
If you are at all interested in working on
F E L I X just come along to the F E L I X Office
and tell someone. Y o u could live to regret it.
Stay cool,
John
