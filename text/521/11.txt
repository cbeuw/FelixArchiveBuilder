The joint RAG committee for
this year was held on Wednesday
23rd May. The main business on
the agenda was to choose the
charities to benefit from RAG
activities next year.
After much debate on the merits
of various charities, a vote was
taken with the result that most of
the money raised next year will be
used to buy a kidney machine (or
m a c h i n e s ) , a n d the m i n o r
charities to benefit will be
G i n g e r b r e a d and A l c o h o l i c s
anonymous.
Following this, there was a
discussion about new types of
slopp shirts to be sold next year.
The meeting then passed on to the
appointment of the new R A G
Treasurer and Rag Secretary.
These two posts were filled by
Ruth Langford, Maths 1, and
Kirsten Pratt, Maths 1 respect-
ively.
After this, o u t g o i n g R A G
Chairman Graham Cox handed
over to Raechel Snee, R A G
Chairman elect, and the meeting
ended with the customary barrel
of beer.
MARANATHA
Seek and you will find.
This, then, is the spirit in which our search must be conducted. W e
must cast aside apathy, pride, prejudice and sin, and seek G o d in scorn
ofthe consequences. O f all the hindrances to effective search the hardest
to overcome are intellectual prejudice and moral self-will. Both arc-
expressions of fear, and fear is the greatest enemy of the truth. Fear
paralyses our search. We know that to find G o d and to accept
Jesus Christ would be a very inconvenient experience. It would
involve the rethinking of our whole outlook on life and the readjustment
of our whole manner of life. A n d it is a combination of intellectual and
moral cowardice which makes us hesitate. W e don't find because we do
not seek. W e do not seek because we do not want to find, and we know
that the way to be certain of not finding is not to seek.
So be open to the possibility that you may be wrong. Christ may in
fact he true. A n d if you want to be a humble, honest, obedient seeker
after G o d , come to the book which claims to be his revelation. Come
particularly to the Gospels which tell the story of Jesus Christ. Give him
a chance to confront you with himself and to authenticate himself to
you. Come with the full consent of your m i n d and will, ready to believe
and obey if G o d brings conviction to you. W h y not read through the
Gospel of M a r k , or John? Y o u could read either through at a sitting
(preferably in a modern translation), to let it make its total impact on
you. T h e n you could re-read it slowly, a chapter a day. Before you read,
pray-perhaps something like this:
'God, if you exist (and I don't know if you do), and if you can hear this prayer (and
I don't know if you can), I want to tell you that I am an honest seeker after the truth.
Show me if Jesus is your Son and the Saviour of the world. And if you bring
conviction to my mind, I will trust him as my Saviour andfollow him as my Lord.'
No-one can pray such a prayer and be disappointed. G o d is no man's
debtor. H e honours all earnest search. H e rewards all honest seekers.
Christ's promise is plain: 'Seek and you will find.'

Elk's Last Stand
If you want to park in
College over July and you
haven't filled in an applica-
tion for a temporary parking
permit for July yet, then you'd
better shift your 'arris and
get over to the Union Office
pronto and fill one in, as the
closing date is today (5.30pm).
Right that's the serious bit
over.
As the end of term approaches
and the Elkin dynasty reaches its
conclusion I get less and less to
write about. M y life seems to be
sublimating into a sexual fantasy
where fact and fiction cannot be
told apart, and a misplaced step
and a weak link in the fragile
fa b r i e of t h e s p a c e - t i m e
continuum can combine to create
a world unknown outside of
personal dream and nightmare;
where fragmented shapes exist in
a chaos of m a x i m u m entropy (he's
talking about the union office
again) like a huge wet dream ofa
nineteenth century physicist.
Enough of this, I'm beginning to
.;ound like Justin Newiand.
Anyway, what I'm really trying to
say is that there are only a limited
no. of events left at IC this year
(I've certainly been saying it in a
funny way). The major one of
which is the Exec Party which is
taking place on the last Thursday
of term (21st June) and which is
bound to be a stormer. Everyone
left at college is invited, bring a
bottle, so put it down in your
diary (along with the optional
Wednesday 1 o'clock one), it's
usually an excellent party. The
other one, of course, is Joint
Council. Another event that is.
This marvellous meeting starts at
2 p m on M o n d a y 18thjunc in the
U n i o n D i n i n g H a l l and if you'd
like to witness great statesmen /
women / persons at work then
pop along and observe the
meeting.
O h well, as my brain's gone
blank-no more elections, no more
U G M s , no more heroes - I'll stop
my inane rambling and get down
to the rope, leather cord and my
friend Nige Nob. Cheers,
M i k e The Elk
