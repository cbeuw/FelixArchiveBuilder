This important post is still unfilled. Anybody interested in taking
over next academic year, please get in touch with Roy Attwood, Elec
E n g 808, int. 3113. The work involves managing the U n i o n lleet of 3
Transits and 2 Landrovers. A strong committee has already been
elected to look after finance, maintenance and tests so the role of future
chairman will be largely that of co-ordinator.
The post carries the option o f a room in hall.
