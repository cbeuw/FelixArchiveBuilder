N O T SATISFIED
The Rector is not satisfied with
Refectory Committee's recent
recommendation for a 0.25 per
cent monthly wages regulator and
has asked the U n i o n President to
collect inaccuracies in her paper
which led to the decision.
The Rector would like a 0.5 per
cent monthly rise to compensate
for wage cost increases with a 5
per cent adjustment in July. But
M a r y Attenborough says that
even alter amendments to her
original calculations only 0.26 per
cent is needed with a 2.5 percent
rise in July. She has accepted the 5
per cent proposal for July.
The annual wages settlement is
paid from lst December. T h e
disagreement between the Rector
and the U n i o n President arises
over how the increased wage costs
should be spread over the whole
year.
M s Attenborough says that the
Rector's calculations are based on
the wage rise taking place on lst
August which she considers is
a b s u r d . Discussions are to
continue at the next Refectory
Committee meeting before the
end of this term.

S t u d e n t s C o m m i t t e e i s
considering ways i n which
overseas students benefit Britain
and investigating a way o f
quantifying this in cash terms.
College is hoping to use this
information to counter arguments
about allowing overseas students
to s t u d y i n B r i t a i n . T h e
Government sets the fees for these
students basing them on the
running costs of the university
divided by the number o f
students. The Overseas Students
C o m m i t t e e says that this
calculation is unrealistic.
At its last meeting the O S C
agreed to consider holding a
conference about small scale
energy sources i n the T h i r d
W o r l d at Imperial College. T h e
conference would be a sequel to
one held at Reading in January.
The Committee also discussed
E n g l i s h l a n g u a g e tests f o r
overseas students. A t the moment
there is no clear definition of the
standard of English required and
some students are finding that
their knowledge o f English is
inadequate.
The Committee decided to set
up a test which will be known as
T O E F L - teaching of English as a
foreign language. A l l overseas
students will have to take this test
and reach a set standard. If they
fail they will be able to retake it
the following year.
WUS S C H O L A R S H I P
T O G O A H E A D
The College and U n i o n have
agreed a means of going ahead
with a W o r l d University Service
scholarship to enable a T h i r d
World student to study at the
College.
College is to find the money
initially but the U n i o n is to
launch an appeal next term to pay
the money back to College.
The U n i o n will have to raise
j£2000 which they hope to raise
from students during registration
and from academic staff by
donations o r covenants. T h e
Union raised £500 for W U S last
October by asking students to
give 50p each.
W U S already runs schemes for
overseas students at other British
universities a n d will add the
Imperial College scholarship to
their list of places advertised i n
T h i r d W o r l d countries. T h e
Rector and U n i o n will have the
final say in selecting the student to
benefit.
The appeal, which will be
signed by the Rector and the new
Union President, Chris Fox, is to
be advertised i n the I C U n i o n
Handbook.
NEW N U R S E S
College is to allow two male
nurses to live in the flat above the
Health Centre. In return for free
accommodation they will be
required to be available to look
after sick patients in the sick bay
at night.
They will replace the three
agency nurses hired by the Health
Centre, making an annual saving
of £9000. T h e nurses will come
from the Brompton Hospital.
The change will mean that
students i n the halls of residence
will no longer be able to call a
College nurse if they are sick at
night but will have to call a
doctor.
M E S S M U S T G O
It is rumoured that Roger
'Tidy' Stotesbury, I C U Secretary
elect, is to be seconded to the
Royal College of Science U n i o n
to tidy up their U n i o n Office.
This course of action has been
suggested by U n i o n President
M a r y Attenborough following
complaints from College about
the mess which can be seen from
the road. The office is close to the
College's Summer Accomodation
Centre office and College fear
that the summer visitors will get a
poor impression of IC.
One o f the promises Roger
Stotesbury made during his
election campaign was to keep the
U n i o n office tidy so it looks like he
will have an early opportunity to
prove his worth.
