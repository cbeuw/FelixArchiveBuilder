T H E N E W S P A P E R O F I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E UNION
Lars Hermansen, the Chairman of Chalmers University Students'
Union in Gothenburg, Sweden, is spending a week in London as a guest
of IC Union.
The visit, which is mostly being paid for by Imperial College, is in
return for the visit made by Union President Mary Attenborough to
Chalmers University at the beginning of this term.
Also in England is Mian who is the Administration Officer of Chalmers
Union. She is on holiday but is taking time off to visit IC Union
About twenty students from Chalmers University study at IC each
year and Lars' visit is aimed at fostering a good relationship between the
two universities.
Lars and Mian are two of Chalmers' six sabbatical Union officers. The
University has a similar number of students as IC and is a centre for
Science and Technology.
Lars arrived on Wednesday and is to stay a week. While over here he
hopes to see Imperial College, meet students including the Swedish
students here this year, and see London, though he is not interested in
the usual tourist attractions but wants to see London life.
Swedish Sabbaticals
Visit Imperial
Swedes have the reputation of
m a k i n g t h e m o s t of t h e
opportunity to consume as much
alcohol as possible when abroad
as it is very expensive in Sweden.
Mary Attenborough and FELIX
Editor John Harris gave them an
early opportunity to quench their
thirst - on the tube journey to
South Kensington from the
airport. There then followed a
sherry session in the Union Office
and a hurried visit to the Queens
before lunchtime closing for a pint
of Lars' favourite, Guinness.
In an attempt to give them
experience of English cooking,
Mary invited them to a dinner
party at her new flat where she
served roast beef and Yorkshire
pudding cooked by herself.
However, Mary admitted that she
had never cooked Yorkshire
pudding before and at the time of
writing it is not known whetherthe
Swedish guests survived her
attempt.
Lars is expected to have an
opportunity to meet the Rector
and the Union is hoping to
arrange a trip to Silwood. On
Monday the visitors will meet
Union Officers over a wine and
cheese party in the Union office.
Lars will also be able to get a true
picture of life as an IC student as
he will be staying in a hall of
residence and will doubtless
experience several moonies.
Mian will be staying on another
week in the British Isles and hopes
to visit Ireland. External Affairs
Officer John Passmore, who
comes from Northern Ireland, has
been explaining to her how to
avoid the bombs.
FELIX hopes they will enjoy
their visit and hopes that relations
between these two Universities
will continue to prosper.

NEWS IN BRIEF
H E A D T E N A N C Y O P E N S ?
College is asking students what
they t h o u g h t of the n e w
a c c o m m o d a t i o n i n L e x h a m
Gardens with a view to taking on
flats for up to 60 students from
next year.
Nineteen students have been
housed in the new L e x h a m
Gardens head tenancy scheme
this term. If they arc satisfied
College will extend the scheme.
BIG C A T S E X P E N S E
College has estimated that it
will cost £750 to clean the two
stone lions at the foot of the
Queens Tower painted blue by
students of Queen M a r y College
earlier this term.
The Vice President of Q M C
U n i o n has promised to make a
contribution to the cleaning and
IC U n i o n are to ask College to
deal directly with Q M C U as I C
U n i o n consider that the problem
is nothing to do with them.

The new Publications Board
C h a i r m a n is to be Jon Firth of I C
Radio. H e was elected at thejoint
Publications Board meeting last
M o n d a y , defeating C o l i n Palmer
by seven votes to six. J o n Firth
will sit on I C U n i o n Council and
replaces J o h n Allen, also of I C
Radio, who held the post this
year.
Earlier the meeting elected
Dave Fuller and C o l i n Palmer as
o r d i n a r y m e m b e r s o f the
Publications Board following
Roger Stotesbury's insistence that
the election should be by paper
ballot on the single transferable
vote system 'lo give me practice for
nextyear'. As I C L'nion Honorary
Secretary Roger will have to run
all U n i o n elections.
The meeting went on to discuss
the printing of the IC 1 nion
Handbook and Phoenix, which is
several weeks behind schedule.
Because FELIX's finances
turned out to be sound £400.
o r i g i n a l l y a l l o c a t e d to the
Handbook to pay F E L I X for
printing before F E L I X was
forced to drastically reduce
charges, was transferred to the
Board's account along with £60
from Phoenix. Publications Hoard
was therefore able to meet claims
by the student television service
S T O I C and I C Radio for new
equipment.
D u r i n g the meeting Deputy
P r e s i d e n t M a l c o l m B r a i n
surprised everyone by leaving
earlv to do some work.
