Arthur Michael brushed back his
coiffured hair, wrapped his cloak
around him and left the building.
Pushing aside all those citizens who had
come to seek advice, he strode out into
the cold evening air, making those
short, tip-toe like steps which
characterised his walk.
Meanwhile, another of the Baron's
employees was finding Christmas a
somewhat unpalatable thought.
"Christmas—umbug!" snorted John
S e c t r e t a r y , thinking of all those
functions which he would have, to
attend with the Baron. "If he starts
rambling on about the politics of his
unimportant fellows I shall probably
vomit."
The typist, whom John Secretary
was addressing, remained unimpressed,
and continued to file her nails. John
Secretary, reluctantly concluding that
his work would not be done for some
days yet, returned to his self-imposed
exile, in a dungeon in the very depths of
the Surefield Building. And it was with
considerable belligerence that he
perused his planning of the move of the
citizens' building to a basement in
Southside.
"Let me see, with a Citizens' Office of
that size, Mrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks is
bound to agree to all my other demands
without question," he thought. John
Secretary was well aware of whose
opinion counted for something. "With
all that room, the President's Office can
be kept well away from the citizens'
entrance. All that fraternising just
confuses her as to whose interests she's
there to represent. And there'll be an

even larger table for Jo Herawhatser-

newspapers at once. They're bound to

John Secretary locked away his plans
from prying eyes, donned a thick black
coat and sneaked into the dark of the
night, frequently glancing skywards,
wary of falling tiles.
Blissfully unaware of John Secretary's

President of the Citizens' Association
was chattering away to her closest
aides at the end of the Christmas party
for a select few of the citizens'
representatives.
"I do so enjoy Christmas,"announced
Mrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks, "It's yet
another excuse to eat, drink and be
merry at someone else's expense."

excuse to eat drink and be merry at someone else's expense.'
"Not that you ever need one,"
thought Sawnoff Levis as he tried to
mend a Gestetner. It had yet to recover
from the day when Mrs Sticks had filled
it with sherry instead of ink.
"You'd think that she'd remember
what false labels she puts on the damn
bottles," said Sawnoff to his friend. But
he received no reply, for that friend was
the heir apparent to the presidency, the
megalomaniac Ian Balls. He was all too
well aware that, if his election was to
succeed, he must not offend the all-
powerful Mrs Sticks. The memory of
how she had connived to evict a
previous representative, claiming that
she had 'a sleep problem' was never
far away. Ian Balls knew when some
things were better left unsaid.
"Time to go, darlings," declared the
somewhat merry Mrs Sticks as she
tumbled head over heels down the
stairs of the citizens' building. She was
not used to the office being open after
four in the afternoon and was still just in
sufficient control of her senses to know
that, with a few drinks inside them, the
representatives might start examining a
few filing cabinets and their contents.
But they all meekly obeyed and Mrs
Sticks firmly locked the door behind
them.
As the citizens slept, and Mrs Sticks
meandered towards home, Pristine, the
wicked witch of Southside, was to be
seen on her broomstick hovering over
her small domain. With her baggage
swaying in the wind, she gleefully stared
over her Empire, from which she was
about to depart. Turning her broom-
stick in the direction of her far away
castle, she cried out:
"I will return."
Cackling with laughter, she sped
across the buildings. And return she
would for, despite many hopes and
prayers, she always found an excuse to
come back.
