At 11:30pm on Friday 2 Dec,
C&GMC once again took over a
sizeable chunk of the Home
Counties for their third thrash
this term, the Detour Rally,
organised by 'Boy Racer of '83*
and Mac. Once again the first
stage proved the most testing, so
much so that about six cars had
to play 'folio"' the leader' until
they got to "liii.e Control 1. At
this point an ectncal short in
the map-reading light in the Imp
decided to make its presence felt.
Five minutes and two fuses later
the repairs were complete when
the navigator managed to smash
the light bulb so it was back to the
torches. Further along the route a
concealed 90° left down a hill was
missed by a five cars, including
course opening, which meant
they ended up in someone's
driveway. One naughty crew
managed to do a three point turn
in one go by using the front lawn
and then making a relativisit
getaway before the occupants
woke up. Nick Anderson con-
firmed his fears by impaling his
Mini on a tree, the effect of which
was to place a front wheel on his
navigator's lap. All this rushing
around led to every crew being
'Over Time Limit' at half-way
where despite being kept warm
by her driver, the Herald
navigator found the freezing
conditions too much especially as
she'd already been sick twice, so
they trundled home at 4:00am.
On the second half of the rally
the marshals at TC6 just
happened to be standing next to a
patch of black ice. When they
flagged down what they thought
was a . competitor, the
unsuspecting person jammed on
the anchors and stopped only
when he'd made contact with the
bend 50 yards up the
road—that's how C&GMC deal
with any unofficial entries. The
battle for first place was mainly
between Will and Graham's
Davrian, the Beetle of Spam and
Frank and Guy and Victor in the
Imp with the latter holding on by
a margin of one fail.
STOIC
Five...Four.. .Three.. .Two... One.
....Run VTs. Hello and welcome
to the last fun-packed instalment
of STOIC this year, the (now I've
found out what that word means
I can get on with producing it)
FELIX • • • • • • •
Christmas programme. Follow-
ing last year's massive success
(the viewer in the JCR woke up)
we have been whipping our brains
to cream to make the sequel. We
can't guarantee it will prevent
hair loss, or kill 99% of all known
lecturers—but remember 8 out of
10 cats said their owners prefer it.
Be there—1:00 and 6:00pm in the
JCR and Halls—or be square.
SDP
SDP Soc is now official.
May I thank all that have
helped to re-establish it, and may
I welcome all who are interested
in it.
So far this term, we have had
meetings on various policies: PR
and Human Rights. We have
been visited by Stuart Maxwell
(Chairperson of SDP Students
and we have visited Kensington
and Chelsea Area SDP general
meeting. We have also connected
up with Westminster area SDP.
Next term we will be going to
see Charles Kennedy MP (the
youngest member in the house) a
few area meetings, internal meet-
ings and a visit to the House of
Commons.
So please come along to are
four events and suggest a few
ideas for more.
Finally, Merry Christmas and
a happy new year with the SDP.
Not much more to go before the
turkey and sherry vacation; but
tomorrow night we have the
Chemistry & Physics party in the
Union Concert Hall costing £1 to
get in from 8:00pm 'til very late.
Things you might care to keep
an eye out for over the Christmas
hols: Spanner & Bolt and other
university mascots (pump your
friends for information and
report back to the VP).
Looking back through the
office diary I can see some of the
events RCSU ran or organised
which may have been lost to your
memory in mists of alcohol and
time:
Trips to Laserium, Ferret &
Firkin, Lewes Carnival, Run For
Your Wife, Rocky Horror Picture
Show, Richmond for Jez
pumping and down to Brighton
on the old crocks van.
Raising money for Rag on
Tiddleywinks, Monopoly, Dawn
to Dusk street collection, Rag
Mag selling at Guildford and
London, the Beer Festival,
Smoking Concert andl06
+ l
Darts.
Many more things to put down
but Pallab keeps complaining
that my bits are too big. (Tut, tut,
boasting again-Ed.)
Watch out for three day old
roast turkey.
Merry Christmas and Happy
New Year from RCSU.

Despite public demonstrations
against siting cruise missiles
in Britain, such as 22 October, the
government, against the views of
the majority of the population,
are going ahead with the
deployment of the missiles. It is
no longer enough just to wear a
CND badge to show support for
nuclear disarmament, direct
action is now required up and
down the country and we can still
do our part.
Final details of what we are
doing will be put up around the
College on Friday 9 December,
so please watch out for them.

THE PHO^IX.
The Phoenix is the official
Union magazine published
once a year around March or
April. It is supposed to be
'artistic', but don't let that put
you off. All 'artistic' means is
writing, from real life or from
the imagination, about what
interests you or moves you.
I'd like the general theme to
be Death and the Super-
natural, but this is only a
suggestion I hope especially
to see many horror, murder
mystery and ghost stories
arriving c/o The FELIX Office
after Christmas. The copy
deadline is 26 January 1984
and all length pieces will be
considered. Remember, the
Phoenix is your magazine—it
relys entirely on student
contributions. The best one
wins £30!
