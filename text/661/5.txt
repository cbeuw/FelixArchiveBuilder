London Student Screwed Up
The London Student newspaper
(previously known as Sennet) is
still without an Editor following
the inquoracy of the meeting last
Tuesday at which teh election
was to have been held. Only five
college delegates turned up for
London Student Council which
has a quorum of fifteen. The
paper is still b~iub "dited by the
Editorial Board, oniposed of
students working on London
Student.
The editor for the present
session should have been elected
last term but th emeeting called
then was also inquorate. A
meeting arranged earlier this
term was postponed amidst
claims of electoral malpractise as
reported in FELIX no 659 and
the meeting was rearranged for
last Tuesday. Two candidates
were standing for the post Chris
Ward (last year's Editor) and
Michael George of Kings
College.
The post of London Student
editor is sabbatical, but due to the
/ amend that

U G M Sketch
This amendment business really is
getting out of hand and this
column is partly to blame, having
explained it in clear English so
that anyone can understand.
Accordingly during the motion
on freedom of choice at last
week's Union General Meeting
an innocuous amendment was
put forward. The proposers of
the motion, the Royal School of
Mines' dynamic duo Tim
Williams and Chris Crownshaw,
were about to accept it when
someone clearly of an nervous
and anxious disposition jumped
to his feed' in the crowd and
screamed* 'Can't you see what
they're trying to do—the motion
will pass over to them and they
will withdraw it.' NO, NO and
NO again.
The amendments accepted—
that the Union is a non-arty
political body and that social
intercourse is promoted through
Social Clubs Committee which
includes political and pressure
groups—were not substantive, in
other words they were cosmetic.
Having cleared up • that little

precarious financial position of
the paper the editor only receives
an undergraduate grant for thirty
weeks during his term of office.
As a further economy measure
the paper is only being produced
every fortnight next term.
Rumours of London Student's
imminent demise are once again
circulating.
Reeves Does
It Again!
A stolen bicycle belonging to an
IC student has been recovered
and an arrest made by the police.
The bicycle was postcoded'in the
recent campaign to cut down on
bicycle thefts from College and
this was the reason that it was
returned to its rightful owner. Mr
Geoffrey Reeves, College
Security Officer, stressed the
importance of all. bicy' s in
College being postcoded.
Thrills and Spills at the UGM
No observers were sent by ICU to
the NUS conference last weekend
following a motion passed at the
U G M last Tuesday which
prevented Union money being
spent on their expenses.
It had been agreed at Council
to send three people to Blackpool
at a cost of between £200 and
£300. None of the three people
chosen, Eric Derbyshire, Peter
Burt and Roger Preece, will now
be going since they would have to
pay their own expenses.
However, a small sum of
Union money is being spent by
the Liberal Club subsidising their
Chairman on a visit to a hurriedly
arranged 'conference' of Liberal
students at non-NUS colleges
which just happens to be in
. Blackpool at the same time as the
NUS Conference.
The other motion passed at the
UGM means that CCUs will be
able to organise any type ofevent
they like on Union premises,
effectively overturning the
motion passed amid controversy
at the last U G M banning
pornographic shows from Union
premises. Michael Newman was
too upset to comment.

amendments were not allowed to

the motion was passed on a show
of hands and best of all iaa paper

upon by someone as a delaying
tactic)—the voting being 312 forj,
187 against.
Naturally the freedom of

have to look at who is proposing
and opposing a motion to know
what it's about and how you're
going to vote.
