of the plughole and enter the various orifices
of the heroine. In Videodrome, James
Woods plays a soft-porn cable T V
programmer who tries to tape a priate
transmission which specialises in perverted
sex and torture. Instead he finds himself
sucked up into the TV screen via the loving
embrace of his girlfriend with S/M tendencies
(Debbie Harry trying to kill her Blondie
image). From this point onwards lots of
special effects are used to persuade you that
something funny is going on, whilst you slide
quietly into total apathy. The plot, script
and acting exponentially decay to the lowest
level I've slept 'hrough in a long time. The
original idea was quite good—how do you
know what is Yr
- jl and what isn't?—but it's
totally mishandled.
It seems the latest trend is to put failing film
ideas into 3D to try to revitalise them. Not
only will there be a 3D Star Trek next year,
but now we have Jaws 3D (Plaza).
Unfortunately the Jaws idea really has been
flogged to death, and this film adds nothing
new. Apparently a lot of care and money was
spent in making the wounds and the shark
look super-realistic, but so what? The
frightening thing about a shark is the
psychological effect it has on people, not the
realism of the blood and gore. 3D adds
something, but without the back-up of a good
plot, script and acting, it's not enough to
spend £3 on, especially if you've seen Jaws
already.
A scene from Parade, starring Jacques
Tati'
Parade (Barbican) along with two short
sketches is a celebration of the French comic
genius, Jaques Tati. 'Who?' was exactly my
response at first. In fact Tati is rather like an
accident prone Eric Sykes and brilliant at
mime. Parade gently examines eccentricity
amongst the audience of ageing hippies and
the performers at a Scandanavian circus
There are a series of acts, some good, some
pathetic, but mostly you're twiddling your
fingers waiting for Tati to come back on. The
film is too long and the individual acts just
don't hang together, but Parade is worth
considering if you're in London and have to
entertain some bored young visitors one
afternoon over Christmas. On the other
hand, The Jungle Book (Odeon Leicster
Square) \c probably better, because
everyone enjoys that.
Tony Atkins
Daniel (Notting Hill Gate from 12
January). Considering the weak fictional
framework around which his book is based, E
L Doctorow, author of The Book of Daniel
and in charge of screenplay for the film, has
made a very brave effort indeed. Originally
written in 1971, 'Daniel' is "the story of two
generations of a family whose ruling passion
is not success or money or love, but social
justice."
Daniel is a graduate student when, after
a nervous breakdown and attempted
suicide by his politically active sister, he
decides to uncover the facts surrounding the
trial and execution of their parents, Paul and
Rochelle Issaacson, who were found guilty of
conspiring to steal US atomic secrets for the
Russians.
Visually, the film has much potential.
Susan's agonising breakdown at the
beginning of the film contrasts with the
powerful execution scene of her father and
mother in the electric chair. All too often
however, the film is spoilt by sterile and over
sentimental imagery. Daniel, at the age of
eight, looks like some child prodigy of Elvis
Presley, and his father looks like Clark Kent.
You're supposed to be watching "a search
for self-discovery", but this film often seems
instead to be the very last remake of Hair.
Because the scope of this film is so diffuse,
it is impossible to commit it to any particular
category. As a documentary it is (self
confessedly) historically quite inaccurate and
as drama it fails , , D _1,
