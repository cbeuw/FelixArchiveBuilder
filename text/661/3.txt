from the depraved unicellular
intellect centre of Jonathan
Gerson in the last issue of
FELIX.
We would like to point out
that our point was the
pointlessness of the points
pointed to by the (eurgh)
human societies pointing to all
the points of the religio-socio-
politico-economo-flymo com-
pass.
We would like it to be known
that due to our immensely
enlightened and sympathetic
outlook ootaincd through the
countless Eli' nhia of natural
universal domination, we bear
no more (or less) malice for this
pathetic entity than for a
harmless tribble beneath
hobnails.

Since the publication of my
letter in last week's FELIX,
several Veg Soc members have
asked me to apologise for my
comments about them, and
have told me that they are not
Communists. They showed me
their positive vetting certificates
to prove it...Talking of vetting,

I also accused its members of
being 'animal lovers and cor-
rupt Union officials'. I admit
that this was going a bit far.
They are actually just animals,
and one corrupt Union official.
By the way, did you know
that the other Liberal Club
member (not the loony who
hangs around the FELIX Office
and follows J Martin Taylor
around) has gone over your
head and written to the editor of
Private Eye. His letter (Eye 573)
explains how M i c h a e l
Meadowcroft, Liberal MP
spoke at IC to an audience of
seven people, including the
organisers of the talk. This
proves that lefties don't mind
making their own party look
foolish, just to get their names
in print. I of course remain loyal
to FELIX, and to the Consoc
members who look forward so
much to my letters/articles. I
hope that these good people will
not suppress their urge to
deluge me with compliments,
Christmas presents , solutions
to my assessed coursework.

article in last week's FELIX
quoting me as saying that the
benefits of INCOST to ICU are
'none'. This seems to derive
from a conversation I had with
Sean Davis (Irishman) and the
delectable Miss Lewis about
conferences in general. My
opinion at the time (and still is)
was that although INCOST was
not financially beneficial to
ICU the contacts made and
information exchanged with
other student officers were very
useful. As a college we are
highly respected in all fields of
technology and as such should
be seen to take part in a
collective European student
organisation.
Perhaps you should have
consulted me rather than rely
on biased opinions such as that
of Sean. The suggestion that my
answer was 'laconic' shows
that, in fact, the article was
probably a complete fabrica-
tion, as the well-meaning but
nevertheless rustic Mr Davis
would not use the word
'laconic'!
Other points need to be
corrected. It is not only the
sabbaticals who attend
conferences. Although Ian Bull
may appear a sabbatical due to
his sherry intake and
attendance at freebies, he and I
have attended Engingeering
conferences while remaining
mere non-sabbatical mortals
(although he may have different
ideas!).

Ithe rest of the time was spent on

Goulder dragged me away from
my problem sheets, forcing me
to drink heavily and generally
make a fool of myself. This side
of life was HELL: the food, the
drink, the smell of the canals! If
anything we should pay our
delegates a subsistence
allowance to cover the essential
of life!
The cost of this year's
conference is potentially high to
ICU. Last year's cost £160 for
the week excluding travel, but
the Dutch were trying to obtain
sponsorship to cover some if
not all of the cost—it is perhaps
a reflection of their ability that
they couldn't. Through my
meetings with the Finns it seems
that their contact with Industry
is exceptionally good so the cost
should be lessened significantly.
We can halve the cost by
sending only one delegate. The
point to remember is that the
delegate should be able to make
a reasonable contribution to the
technological discussion, with
drinking and hack credibility
being secondary considera-
tions. No doubt the Organisa-
tion of Bald Presidents will
make a further statement
through its famous leader, but a
more detailed scrutiny of all
Union expenditure (CCU and
Clubs) will reveal all sorts of
wastage, fraud and duplication
of effort.
Yours etc
