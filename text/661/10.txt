The Sabbatical
Credibility Game
Next term the sabbatical race will start in
earnest. There are many pitfalls along the
road to your free room, free sherry and
postgrad grant, and also there are many
unexpected ways to increase your
sabbatical credibility. It would be tiresome
just to list all these, so learn for
yourself—play 'Estates and Scaffolding'.
Rules
Men start at the beginning of the game.
However, women should determine their
starting position as follows: take your chest
measurement (in .inches) and subtract from
42. Then divide your measurement by the
result of the subtraction. (Note: if your
measurement is 42 or above, congratula-
tions—you have already won!). Deduct 1 if
you have hairy legs and 2 more for a face like
a horse, then position your counter on the
square number closest to the result and
start from there. If you land at the foot of a
piece of scaffolding, follow it up to the top. If
you land on the head or hands of any of the
Men from Estates, go down to the foot.
(Upper foot for an odd throw, lower foot for
an even throw.)
Instructions
Get your mummy (or another grown-up) to
cut out the tokens. (You can do this yourself
with round-ended scissors, if you are uery
careful.) They can be made nice and stiff if
you stick them to pieces of card with
sellotape or glue. You can draw your own
face on the blank one if you like. Then find a
pair of dice and off you go. Have fun!
