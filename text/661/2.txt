Letters
Fremantle
Allegations
Dear Sir
After reading your article on
the 'resignation' of Andrew
Walker, the Fremantle Hotel
warden. I feel that the story as
presented has been engineered
by Mr Walker to reflect his
views and not admit that any
blame lies with him. 1 have first-
hand knowledge of several
incidents that helped him to
lose what little respect he ever
had from the residents in the
last year.
on one occasion a resident of
the Fremantle wrote a letter to
Michael Arthur complaining
about his abuse of his room
pass keys and called for
disciplinary action. Mr Arthur
then reprimanded Mr Walker
and told him that an apology
was in order. Mr Walker then
wrote an apology but unable to
face the victim, used his passkey
again to enter her room, placing ,
the note and some flowers on
her desk.
Later in the year, myself and
the same resident had left a bag
containing our cooking
implements in the kitchen. Her
keys were inside the bag. When
we returned the keys were
missing. After a protracted
search we were informed by
another resident that Mr
Walker had taken them from
the bag and had said that if we
wanted the keys, we would have
to get them from him. By this
time my girlfriend felt unable to
even speak to Mr Walker and so
I retrieved the keys from him.
When I asked how he had come
by them, he told me that
someone had handed them to
him after finding them in the
sink.
In addition to this, on several
occasions Mr Walker made
comments concerning our
relationship freely to other
residents some of which I was
informed by those Who heard
them were quite offensive.
In my opinion, Mr Walker
has been sacked more because
of these, and other, complaints
against him, than because of
any attempted whitewash by
Student Services.
I am not writing this letter to
spite Mr Walker, but hopefully
to draw attention to the fact
that proper procedures for
appointing wardens must be
adhered to; even if this means
leaving a wardenship empty i
for a short while, and also to |

speak up for those who had a
less than pleasant stay in what
was the friendliest place in
which I have ever lived before
these incidents occurred.
Yours in concern (and anger)

Gripes
Dear Pallab
I would like to draw your
attention to several errors in
your reporting of the Fremantle
Hotel during the summer.
First the condition of the
Fremantle was only of concern
to me during the summer, and
only those parts that affected
my residents and staff. Second,
I was asked to phone the fire
inspector by Mr Andrew
Walker so that the positioning
of some new fire extinguishers
could be ascertained.
Something that none of my staff
or myself are qualified to do.
Finally, I was not given a
stern dressing down from
Michael Arthur (if I was- I
wasn't there when it
happened!).
From these above errors it
may lead the reader to question
how many more there are in
your articles.
Andrew Barron
Ed's Apology. Sorry Andy. I
would just like to make it clear
that you were not in the least bit
concerned about conditions in
the Fremantle or its residents and
you didn't call in the fire
inspectors. We fully and
unreservedly withdraw any
credit we gave you in the article.
PS: You're bound to get your
subwardenship now.
Clean Slate
Dear Pallab
The front page article in
FELIX of 25 November 1983
entitled 'Estates Slated in Tiles
Fiasco' included errors of fact
and drew false conclusions.
The Electrical Engineering
Building was completed in 1961
and like many buildings of that
time is suffering from an
inherent constructional defect.
In 1977 it became evident that
the tiles cladding the building
were in danger of falling off and
a scaffold fan was erected to
protect passers by. The College
sought professional and legal
advice with a view to obtaining
recompense from the architects
and builders. Since then there
has been a complex, legal
process during which the
College has followed the
guidance of its legal advisers.
Initially it was necessary that
the evidence of failure be
retained for inspection by the
architects and contractor.
By 1982 negotiations had
reached a point where Counsel
advised that inspection from a
scaffold was required, including
the removal of tiles and
thereafter reinstatement could
p r o c e e d . The C o l l e g e
negotiated with the UGC for a
loan to cover the large part of
reinstatement cost.
Legal cases of this kind are
complex and the College would
have been negligent if it had
taken decisions on the remedial
works without following legal
advice. To those not aware of
the facts, the delay in correcting
the defects of the bulding may
well have seemed inexplicable.
Yours sincerely

Human Rights
Week
Dear Pallab
As joint organiser of Human
Rights Week, I would like to
counter points forwarded by
Mr Jonathan Gerson in the last
issue of FELIX.
I personally sent invitations
to all OSC and SCC societies
inviting them to take part in the
Human Rights Week. If these
societies choose to respond by
examining Human Rights
abuses outside the Soviet
Union, they should be free to do
[Wednesday, 14 December, 19831
so without being accused of
hijacking the week for political
purposes.
I made it clear in my letters
the societies that Human Rights
Week was to be used to
campaign for Human Rights,
not for propaganda, or merely
to promote a College society.
Of all the participating
societies, only one expressed an
interest in abusing the spirit of
Human Rights Week by asking
for an extra table in the JCR
solely for the promotion of that
society's literature and
ideology. Mr Gerson happens
to be Chairman of that society.
It is beginning to become
clear that Mr Gerson has some
confusion about what Human
Rights are, or that he is just
plainly hypocrtical.
Perhaps it is understandable
that Mr Gerson, as a strident
capitalist and a Jew, sees the
worst violations of Human
Rights as occuring behinJ the
Iron Curtain.
If he were not so blinkered by
his own political rantings, he
may realise that if he were a
non-white in South Africa, or a
Liberal in Chile, he would
suffer absues every bit as
abhorrent as those occuring in
the Soviet Union.
Dismissing Anti-American
feeling as 'trendy' isjust as short
sighted when considering the
role of the US in upholding and
extolling repressive regimes
throughout Central and South
A m e r i c a , and indeed,
throughout the whole world.
The philosophy here is that
there cannot be an abuse of
Human Rights if done in the
name of anti-'Communism'.
It is people who are prepared
to put Human Rights second to
political doctrines who betray
the world.
Far be it from Mr Gerson's
job to accuse others if not
caring about Human Rights at
all.

Dear Pallab
As representatives of some of
the more puny insignificant
demi-deific mega-beings of the
multiverse, we find ourselves
obliged to attract the attention
of the populace to the heretical
rantings and un-informed
gobbledy-gook spewed forth
