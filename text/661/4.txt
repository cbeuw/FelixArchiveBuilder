Bot Zoo to Open!
The Bot-Zoo tea room is to re-
open next term following
pressure from FELIX and Life
Sciences students led by the Dep
Rep Tim Wilson. It is not yet
clear whether the Biology
Department or the Union will be
running the service, which will
only be available in the mornings.
The room itself is a Union
room but because of a long-
standing agreement it is under the
control of the department during
the day, originally because of the
department's tea service.
Professor Wood, head of the
Biology department, was anxious
that with the demise of the service
the room should still remain
under his control as before. He
wrote to Union President Gaynor
Lewis asking her to confirm the
agreement, saying that it was
necessary to preserve the
arrangement in case the
department ever re-started the
tea service. This Miss Lewis
refused to do unless there was a
firm commitment to re-starting
the service.
Professor Wood replied saying
that he hoped the department
would be able to re-open the tea
room next term, and promised to
give a definite decision before the
start of next term.
Meanwhile, the Union has
been planning to re-open the tea
room. Internal Services Officer
Hugh Southey has carried out a
costing analysis of the service and
concluded that it could be run on
a self-financing basis. Deputy
President Christine Teller has
agreed to oversee the financial
side of the operation. If Professor
Wood does not re-open the tea
room then it appears the Union
will step in to provide the service.
No Nonsense NOS
The Imperial College mainframe
has been running on a new
operating system since Monday.
The main purpose of the new
system is to bring into operation
the new Cyber 855 that arrived in
summer. This machine is three
times more powerful than the
Cyber 174 currently in use and
offers users an increased core
memory of 80k decimal words
after 6:00pm. There is also a new
category for batch jobs with up to
131k decimal words available.
The immediate differences for
undergraduates are the new
logging in procedure and the
greatly increased line speeds on
some terminals (2400 baud rather
than 300). There are minor
changes in some of the
commands and other, major
changes for more advanced users.
A total of over 200 people
attended Dramsoc's Christmas
production The Unknown Soldier
and His Wife last week. The play,
written by Peter Ustinov, proved
to be a humorous evening's
entertainment with the comical
aspects of the script being
portrayed to the full by a cast of
varying experience, some of
whom were appearing on stage
for the first time. The production

used a minimum amount of set,
relying more upon the
costumes—many of which had
been made specially for the
show—and a variety of props to
portray images. The show's
director, Ian Lacey, was said to
be pleased with the way it went
although he spent much of the
first performance in the bar and
was too tired and emotional to
comment further.
Student Dies
in Sports Centre
A student was drowned in
mysterious circumstances in the
College swimming pool on
Monday. He was discovered on
the bottom of the pool by
members of the Water Polo Club
who were practising in the pool.
The swimming pool is open for
general swimming on Mondays
until 6:15pm, when it is cleared
by the attendant. Then at 6:30pm
the Water Polo Club have a
prviate session until 8:30pm,
when the Swimming Club take
over. It was whilst the Water
Polo goals were being taken
down and replaced with rope lane
markers at the change over time
that the body was noticed at the
bottom of the deep end of the
pool.
The body was recovered from
the pool and members of the
Water Polo and Swimming Clubs
attempted to revive the student
using artificial respiration and
heart massage but to no avail. It
was apparent that the body had
been in the water for a
considerable time.
It is known that the student,
Christopher Darkes of Electrical
Engineering 1, left a lecture at
5:30pm and went to the Sports
Centre. It is also known that he
was fond of swimming lengths
underwater. What is still unclear
however is exactly when he
entered the pool. If he was lying
on the bottom of the pool at the
end of general swimming at
6:15pm then he should have been
discovered by the pool attendant
on duty, although because of the
shape of the pool bottom it is
possible that he wasn't seen at
this time.
The most likely explanation,
however, is that he entered the
pool (probably for the second
time that evening) at between
7:15 and 7:25pm when two girls
who were watching the water
polo remember seeing a stranger
enter the pool room. They did not
notice him again, but they think
that the body removed from the
pool (when they were still
present) was the person they saw
entering just over an hour earlier.
OBITUARY
Christopher Darkes
It is with deep regret that we report the death of
Christopher Darkes, a first year Electrical Engineering
student and resident of Falmouth Keogh Hall. He was
drowned in the College swimming pool on Monday 5
December, despite the valiant attempts to revive him by
staff and students in the Sports Centre.
Although at College for less than a term, Chris
contributed a great deal to Hall and College life. He was a
most popular and friendly student who was always
willing to help others. Chris will be sorely missed by us
all.
Our deepest sympathy is extended to his family,
girlfriend and many friends in Hall and Department. His
funeral took place on Monday 12 December at Stanford
Rivers, Essex, but a short memorial service is being held
at 9:00am on Thursday 15 December in Southside Upper
Lounge for anyone who wishes to attend.
