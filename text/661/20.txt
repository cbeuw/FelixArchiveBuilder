FELIX Fabulous Free Gift
Just the thing to brighten up any Christmas tree-your
very own Michael Arthur 'Good but Not Very Useful'
Christmas Tree Fairy, complete with Mike Stuart pink
dress. All you have to do to construct your Fairy is
follow the simple instructions below.
1. Cut out carefully around the Michael Arthur body
(how carefully you cut around his private parts is
entirely up to you) and the Mike Stuart pink dress.
2. Fold the Mike Stuart pink dress round into a cone
and glue the tab marked 'A' to the dress. Hold together
with a clothes peg until completely dry.
3. Cut carefully down the two slits marked 'B'.
4. Slot the body into the dress so that the head sticks
out and the arms stick through the slits.
5. Ram a Christmas tree up it as hard as you can!
Have fun!
