This is probably the hardest puzzle I've ever
seen. Anyone who solves it will have earned
their fiver, as well as my eternal admiration. If
no one solves it, the fiver will go to the winner
of the other division puzzle, so send answers
in for that as well. The object is to fill all the
spaces correctly, and the answer is unique,
given that the last nine digits of the answer
form a recurring decimal. In fact if anyone
can do it I'll give them a fiver of my own!

In response to several people asking for a
chess puzzle, here is one donated by
Anatoly. Spanner (white, to play) and Bolt
' were playing chess the other day. One of the
white pawns was knocked off the board, and
Spanner tried to replace it in its previous
position. He couldn't remember whether it
was B2 (shown), C2, D2 or E2 but as it turned
out, it didn't matter since if he replaced it on
any of these four squares, he could still mate
in two if he was to play next. How would he
manage that in each case?
