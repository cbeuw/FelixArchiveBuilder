Knocking
Off
It seems that with his
forthcoming marriage Gary
Turner, Michael Arthur's
o b n o x i o u s s i d e k i c k , is
looking for somewhere larger
to live since his room at Earl's
Court Square isn't large
enough for.two. Now that
Michael has successfully
kicked out Andy Walker from
the Fremantle there is a
vacant honeymoon suite all
ready and waiting for Gary's
big day.
Both Gary and Andy were
good mates of Michael Arthur
when he appointed them to
the Fremantle last year.
However, Gary had to be
moved to Earl's Court
Square, a real pit of a head
tenancy, where he has since
been feeling the heat due to
his failure to get the place in
any sort of order. Now with
Andy having fallen from
favour and Gary having been
busy arselicking all year it's
Gary's turn for the cushy
number.
Talking of cushy numbers
Michael has been knocking
off other members of his
staff. Yes sir, they're all one
big happy family at Student
Services. It seems the man
will resort to any thing to
keep a united and loyal staff.
Gaynor Lewis!!!
Dontcha love her?!?
With her ever so tight wee
jeans and her big nose she's
like a red rag to a BuW.U
(Geddit?!?) (Everyone else
does!!!)
Grimwash
half-baked
The College T V Studio boss
Mr Colin Grimshaw really is a
dreadful person.
He was invited to an
excellent U n i o n freebie
recently, only to announce
that he could have organised
it better himself!
"My microwave baked
potatoes would have gone
down a treat," he moaned.
Mr Grimshaw-, 62, is a
confirmed bachelor.

Commemoration Day is
typically a grand occasion at
Imperial College. The best
food is hoarded up for weeks
beforehand by Mr Mooney.
Brightly coloured academic
gowns are brought out of
m o t h b a l l s by a g e i n g
professors who ought to have
better taste.
And it's amazing to see
what lengths people will go to
in order to ensure that
nothing mars the celebra-
tions.
I'm thinking in particular of
Lady Flowers. A few years
ago she threw a party at 170
Queensgate on Commem
Day. Among the large retinue
of celebrities present was one
aged lady who had the
misfortune to kick the buc-
ket during the party.
Lady Flowers was faced
with a dilemma. O n the one
hand it was unthinkable to
allow doctors into the house
on Commem Day. O n the
other, it would be unseemly
for a prostrate figure to be
removed, by stretcher, from
the party.
Lady Penny, a guest who
had some medical experience
(she was a nurse during the
war), advised Lady Flowers
that there was no hope for the
patient. Suddenly the solution
to the problem occurred to
the two venerable peeresses.
Between them the ladies
m a n a g e d discreetly to
manhandle the patient to the
cupboard-under-the-stairs in
170. She was propped up
beside some old mops and
buckets and the door was
locked. The heroines were
then able to return to the
party to socialise and so forth.
After the other guests had
left, the corpse (for by then it
was such) was tidily disposed
of in the usual way.
Aren't we lucky to have
such a quick-thinking and
resourceful lady as our
Rector's wife?
Oats
Dave Parry hasn't been
getting his oats recently! After
a particularly heavy night's
drinking recently, he and
Sean Davis made their way
back to Dave's girlfriend's
room in Southside. (Follow-
ing it so far folks?)
As they stood outside her
room, a coin was tossed.
"Heads you win, tails I
lose," said Dave, who is really
quite clever when he's pissed.
A dejected Dave Parry was
later seen sulking in Princes
Gardens. Mr Sean Davis was
too busy to comment.

There are five rooms on a
landing in Telmouth/Sizkirk
Hall. The rooms are normally
occupied as shown in the
diagram.
Picture the scenario on the
landing one night a couple of
weeks ago. Steve Goulder
slept alone in Ian Bull's room,
Sean Davis's room was
empty, Dave Parry slept
alone in his own room, Sean
slept in Dave's girlfriend's
room and Gaynor slept (not
necessarily alone) in her own
room. Where did Ian Bull
sleep? Answers on a postcard
please, to reach the FELIX
Office before Gaynor has a
chance to read this issue.
