abseiled into small chambers, we
had reached the pushing front; a
rope disappeared through the floor
where a team had been a few days
previously, but the rock corridor
that led of horizontally had never
been visited.
Easily passing along the passage
and down a few climbs – we were
eventually paused by the presence
of a triangle of black space in the
floor needing a rope. A natural lime-
stone sofa had formed next to this
drop, which we took turns to rest
upon while the other was hammer-
ing the rock. There was a lot of
quartz in this limestone, each blow
threw off a shower of bright red
sparks.
Anchors driven into the rock, knots
tied; I abseiled down into a chamber
Jarvist Frost
Over the summer, Imperial College
Caving Club went to Slovenia on
expedition. Camping with special
permission in a national park at
1880m, eating dehydrated food
cooked with snow melt, we have
worked with the local Slovenians
to discover over 17km of cave dur-
ing the last decade. This is a short
description of a single ten-hour trip
amongst dozens that went on during
that time.
Once you start abseiling, all the
unease drains away as autopilot
takes over; but if you do look down –
there’s simply nothing to see but the
vertical wall disappearing into the
distance, the depths being simply
too great for your light to penetrate.
After some twenty meters down, you
come across a rather startling dis-
covery – the enormous tennis-court
of a ledge that you had been happily
standing on is nothing more than
a rock-bridge; a random assembly
of boulders that fell from the roof
aeons ago and wedged themselves
together halfway up the pitch.
Further down I came upon a junc-
tion in the ropes. The old rope starts
a trail that leads down vertically
another 600m, past two abandoned
campsites, before zooming North
in undulations that takes it below
& beyond the neighbouring moun-
tain chain – three years of effort
to explore its full extent. I took the
sideways fork – bouncing myself
diagonally across the rock in a style
that earned this new development
the name ‘Kaptain Kangaroo’.
After a few more hours of mean-
dering, gradually getting deeper as
we stomped along passages and
he Descent
Imperial Cavers Plumb he Depths
with a beautiful mud floor – cracked
up & lifting in enormous curled din-
ner plates of dried clay.
Waiting to leave on the rope, I
looked around once more at the
chamber. The delicate floor had
fallen fowl of our heavy wellies
and abrasive knees, it may take
the retreat of the glaciers of the
next ice-age before it reforms. We
leave the rope in situ – a potential
passage leads off higher up, but its
never certain whether future teams
in future years will ever find the
motivation to come back – an inter-
esting, but modest, branch line in
one of many cave systems on that
mountain alone. Nearly a thousand
miles away, a mile up into the air,
deep within a mountain, that rope is
hanging perfectly still in the dark.

Sports Editor
Greetings and a warm welcome to
what promises to be another excit-
ing year of college sport. For those
of you returning I am sure you are
all looking forward to catching up
with team-mates to plot the downfall
of those unfortunate enough to come
up against the might of Imperial’s
sportsmen and women, aided by
either rigorous training in our brand
spanking new sports centre or just
plenty of team bonding sessions in
the Union Bar. I will not fritter away
my inaugural column preaching to
the converted so for those of you
who are either new to Imperial or
elected not to take part in organ-
ised sport last session I urge you to
attend the freshers fair and sign up
for whatever sport interests you. In
addition to shamelessly cheerlead-
ing for IC sports teams part of my
remit as sports editor is to extol the
virtues of being a member of a club
so here goes.
First and foremost being a mem-
ber of one of our numerous clubs
is one of the best opportunities for
meeting new friends that college
life will present. In general due to
sports people being better balanced
due to their wide range of interests
they are far more fun than the stu-
dents who could be accused of tak-
ing their studies a little too seriously.
By all means work hard but ask
yourself is getting straight A’s really

worth being transformed into an
introverted geek? In addition there
is also the benefit of regular exer-
cise. Your first year away from home
will probably involve pigging out on
junk and /or copious quantities of
alcohol. I mean do you really want
your friends back home to kit you
out in a “I went to Imperial College
but all I got was a fat arse” t-shirt
next summer?
The other question some of you
may ask is “am I good enough?”
The answer is a resounding yes. All
abilities are catered for from com-
plete beginner up to outrageously
talented so no matter where you
are on the sporting spectrum you’ll
soon find your niche. One of the
benefits of union-subsidised sport
is you have the chance to try things
that you may not have encountered
before either due to the require-
ment for expensive equipment or
just plain old regional unpopular-
ity. Even if you only have a passing
interest in a sport most societies
run initial trial sessions so have a go
and at the very least you’ll be able to
walk away knowing for sure that it
wasn’t for you.
So go forth ladies and gentlemen
and sign up for your chosen cause.
With any luck some of you may even
feel the urge to share news of your
exploits through the pages of this
esteemed journal. Contributions to
the above address please and best
of luck in all your sporting endeav-
ours.

reviews and reports to
