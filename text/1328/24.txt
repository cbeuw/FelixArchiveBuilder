E-mail felix@imperial.ac.uk with
the answers to the intro questions
above, and we'll set you up a date
to remember.
26 October 2005: Rich & Angela
blind date felix@imperial.ac.uk
Each week Felix plays match-maker and sets up two of Imperial students in the
hope they’ll ﬁnd love, or at least have a laugh.
Describe your ideal partner?
My ideal partner would be sensitive, big-
hearted, generous and kind. I would have to
find him physically attractive (this doesn’t
mean he has to be the world’s greatest
looker), he has to have a sense of humour,
he has to be able to talk about a wide
breadth of topics. And, yes he has to be
taller than me, no mean feat as I am only
5ft 2!
Which famous person would you say most
resembles you?
A famous person that resembles me
(laughs), thats a bit far-fetched. I don’t
think I have the X-factor. Oh, well personal-
ity-wise I would say Meg Ryan – I’m whim-
sical, a bit fickle-minded, and I just have
weird demands sometimes.
What is your favorite type of cheese?
My favourite type of cheese (laughs)? I
don’t really like cheese – but for the heck of
it – I would say Camembert.
Describe your ideal partner?
My ideal partner will have a youthful com-
plexion, but the vigour and experience of a
strict upbringing and good schooling. She
shall have child-bearing hips and a submis-
sive manner and be no stranger to the kitchen
and the bedroom. She shall be respectful
and diligent and shall speak only whenst
instructed.
Which famous person would you say most
resembles you?
I am famous!
What is your favorite type of cheese?
Bitto della Valtellina, a rare cheese, produced
above 4,000ft in Italian alpine pastures. It’s
made from a blend of approximately 90%
cow’s milk and 10% goat’s milk and aged up
to one year. It has the most divine tangy and
wonderful flavour, while its aroma is sweet
and botanical. As the cows are grazed so
high up, they don’t produce much milk, so not
much cheese either, making it really difficult
to get hold of, but I have a supplier in London
Bridge who sorts me out.

Angela’s Verdict
What where your first thoughts when you
saw Rich?
He looked like a normal guy.
Did you fancy him?
(laughs)
Did you enjoy yourself?
Yes, good fun and good conversation.
What did you eat?
Lamb Rojan Josh, I don’t normal enjoy
Indian food, but, this was great.
So is Rich funny?
Yeah, very funny.
Will you be seeing him again?
We haven’t made arrangements yet, but
hey, you never know.
And, finally, the question everyone wants
ask, did you kiss?
No, I don’t normally kiss on a first date.
Rich’s Verdict
What where your first thoughts when you
saw Angela?
Umm, oh god, how to put it into words. A
very distinct emotion. Possibly, her lack of
courteousness. She ignored me knocking
on the door, while I was trying to get into
the Felix office.
Did you fancy her?
She was a delightful and enigmatic girl.
But, I’m not one who falls in love at first
sight.
Did you enjoy yourself?
I had a pleasant evening. The food was col-
ourful, tasty, and the service was excellent.
Will you be seeing her again?
Sadly, due to current circumstances the
chances of us managing to meet again
will be down to the dice of fate. However,
should the oppurtunity arise, it would not
be a displeasure to recieve the offer. But,
let’s just say I won’t jumping over the
moon.
So you didn’t kiss?
No, we didn’t.
