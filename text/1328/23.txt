I
t’s a new Imperial year, and
without Southside bar I don’t
know how I’ll survive! I write
this article to the new Impe-
rial students in the hope that I
might influence the way you always
behave, and mould you into normal
human being. It’s odd that I feel like
have I tell new students how to act,
but it is “gimperial!”
First of all, if you are a girl do not
get spit roasted in the first week.
This has actually happens every
year in Freshers week, everyone
always finds out (normally via web
cam), and you will be labelled a
cheap whore for the rest of your life.
If you don’t mind the names (union
S__) go for it, just make sure it is
two good looking guys.
If you are guy don’t write a di-
ary (the blue book), and leave it
lying around in halls. Especially if
it depicts your penis size against
time, maps of where your pubes are
growing and your innermost sexual
fantasies.
To be more serious, I beg, in
fact I plead with you, please do not
make yourselves look like a bunch
of prepubescent wankers… guys
please don’t all flock over the same
girls, it is sickening! You see it every
year ten guys crowding around one
girl, who is not even particularly
good looking. To be honest none of
you have a chance if you all treat
her like a god, because within two
Dear Readers,
Welcome and welcome back to the
wonderful world of Stormy Woods!
I trust you all had an amazing
summer without me? Well, some-
one had to, given that the deities of
conscientiousness decided to pay
*me* a visit - to shoot me a cupid’s
bow full of assignments and revi-
sion! The fifth year is not fun when
it comes to getting my most exqui-
site nose down to the grindstone,
despite the increased responsibility
shadowing at an outer London GP
practice brings….
..and added responsibility in an
affluent area of London is certainly
a bonus when the catchment area
contains twenty-thousand tanned
and built South African men under
the age of thirty-five. I don’t mind
doing over-time just this once…or
twice. It’s best I don’t get greedy,
since my friends in areas with high
concentrations of males of the per-
suasion they don’t find attractive,
fight amongst themselves to depu-
tise at my practice. Their fervour is
heightened especially when a viola-
tion of the doctor-patient relation-
ship isn’t covered in either of our
medical defence policies! Students
are a grey area, and whilst ethics
may dictate one set of rules whilst
you’re playing doctor, hormones
dictate another!
And boy, does it feel good to
finally relieve some frustration! GP
surgeries are wonderful - just ripe
for the picking, given that the young
patients who visit aren’t chroni-
cally ill, and the medical equipment
(including the all-important couch)
is ready and waiting!
Most importantly, I am ready and
waiting, for the freshers – it’s rude
not to offer them living anatomy tu-
torials as and when they see fit (and
if they are fit – males of the surfer/
goth persuasion are preferred, al-
though I wouldn’t be rushing to kick
a cute skater/indie-boy out of bed!).
Unattractive males and females
need not apply, offer subjected to
terms and conditions of the Stormy
Woods safe sex act of 2005.
Legalities and formalities aside,
my summer was not all doom and
gloom. The trip to the Big Apple
went very well – with Stormy’s
previous top-ten best looking men
being shunted down another ten
places for an exclusive selection of
American hot-like-woah! Regret-
fully for me, the bleeding fanny put
a stop to my efforts, and I left New
York with a suitcase full of clothes,
shoes, make-up and CD’s and an
array of cultural experience on a
non-sexual level. Positively-speak-
ing, sex on my own has never been
better; I thank the men of New York
profusely – I can see how the SATC
girls got inspired ;)
Naughty also had a second
holiday whilst the rest of you were
getting down and dirty at the
Carling Weekend and the Notting
Hill Carnival! An old friend took
me to Budapest, where we had a
very civil girlie weekend admiring
the architecture, classical music
and the cuisine. Coffee and cake is
definitely the way to this girl’s heart
– especially with a little kink the
way they do in Covent Garden! Hun-
garian men are very charming with
a rustic ruggedness. They’re very
refined, and appear to be grossly
misrepresented at Imperial College
by a very horny, churlish chappie
every female I’m friends with has
had the misfortune of meeting.
*sighs*
I better leave you now – I need
both my beauty sleep and verve for
tomorrow’s patients.
Until next time….be good ;)
weeks she have her head so far
stuck up her own ass she won’t be
able to hear you.
Girls, get over the fact that you
get so much attention, it’s not
because you are pretty, it’s not
because you are cool, its just there
aren’t any other girls to compete
with.
I hope as my new readers you will
end up sympathising with at least
some of my views. For example, I
do not understand those that come
to uni with girlfriends/boyfriends
from school or home. It is not going
to work! You are too young… go
out and enjoy yourselves, you are
missing out on the best days of your
lives.
Girls don’t sleep with someone
within at least the first month. They
may seem nice, but get to know
them first, if you sleep with the
wrong person straight away your
reputation might never recover.
However, if you sleep with someone
after this period and he’s still an
idiot, 1) you probably deserve it and
2) well done to the guy for either,
getting her so pissed or being able
to pull the wool over her eyes.
Well thats about it for this week,
but I have been told to tell you a bit
about myself. I am not particularly
good looking, very unpopular and
have an extremely small penis, so it
is up to you if you ignore my words
of wisdom, but be warned.

Southside bar
This will be the first year of
Imperial without Southside bar.
For those Freshers amongst you
Southside bar was arguably the
most popular bar on campus.
It was a dingy little place in the
basement of Southside halls in
Princes Garden. Its decor was in
need of replacing and the furni-
ture was falling apart.
But, it was still the best place
to go for a drink on campus, and
its going to be a sad year without
it. College did suggest re-hous-
ing Southside in Linstead hall,
but last year’s Union President,
Mustafa Arif, thwarted this plan.
In doing so he also caused the
closure of all hall bars. So if your
sitting around halls wondering
why you can’t get a cheap drink,
you know who to blame.
This issue might not have been
quite as important if there were
any suitable local alternatives. If
you haven’t discovered the local
prices yet, lets just say you’ll be
lucky to get a pint for under £3.
UNITE halls
What happened in Liverpool hap-
pened, but its in the past now.
Its important that Freshers are
aware of the previous problems,
but these halls should be judged
on their future performance.
Piccadilly court is a long way
from College, but student accom-
modation in London is scarces
at the best of times and this
appears to be the optimal solu-
tion. Southside had to come down
and the new building promises to
surpass even Beit in luxury.
But, are luxurious halls what
students want? The new ensuite
Southside rooms are likely to
cost in the region of £130 a week,
compared to the previous £90.
At a time of the introduction of
top-up fees and spiralling London
living costs. Should priorities not
be focused on providing more
affordable, if more basic student
accommodation?
Letters
To be the become a better news-
paper Felix needs to know whats
going on, and issues are impor-
tant to you.
The best ways you get your
views heard by everyone in
College, including Sir Richard, is
to write a letter to Felix. We will
endeavour to publish every letter
received from students, staff and
those from outside Imperial.
Previous letters in Felix, par-
ticularly those about the Library
situation, have brought ‘the pow-
ers that be’ to attend issues that
affect you.
Don’t just whinge to your
friends and colleagues write to
Felix.
To encourage letter writing, the
‘star letter’ received each week
will win £10 or a prize of their
choice from the Felix freebie pile.
