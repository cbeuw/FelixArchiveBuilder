irected by David
Cronenberg, A History
of Violence is a film that
covers the “inescap-
able situation” theme
the director has dealt with before.
Starring Viggo Mortensen (best
known as Strider from the Lord of
the Rings trilogy) as the go-lucky
family guy Tom Stall, this is one of
Cronenberg’s most accessible films
yet.
Settled happily in a small com-
munity, Tom runs his own average-
joe “Stalls” diner, and is married
happily to very American wife Edie
(Maria Bello), who together parent
their son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and
daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes). Tom
leads a respectable life with a good
standing in the community.
However, this peaceful present
is shattered when Tom thwarts
an attempted robbery at his diner,
unwillingly allowing his past to catch
up with him. The media praises
him as a hero, but his actual history
could not be further from this, and
now Tom, his family and his commu-
nity have to discover the ugly truth
the hard way. An interesting, but
imperfect, look at a person’s History
of Violence.
The film is well executed and
directed, but contains a few unnec-
essary scenes, especially in the
introduction where there are many
Land of the ‘senseless’ dead
Zombies past their prime
Land of the dead by George A.
Romero is deader than the zom-
bies it has in it. The story is sim-
ple. Several years ago, dead people
rose from their graves in search
of human flesh. Like vampires, the
zombies turn the live ones into zom-
bies by biting them. The humans
who managed to escape the terrible
curse barricaded themselves in the
city, fending the zombies off with
barbed electric wire. What makes
things bizarre is the fact that there
is still status division in such dire
times. There are the rich ones who
stay in the nice high-rise building
and then there are the poor normal
people whose lives are limited to the
basement and the ground.
Every night, the humans organ-
ized raids into zombie-ville for food
and medicinal supplies. All they had
to do were to release fireworks in
the sky (which apparently stupe-
fies the zombies), ransack the aban-
doned grocery stores and shoot any
zombie that dares to cross their
path. However, one of the ‘smart-
er’ zombies was infuriated by the
humans’ intrusion into their world.
He led the zombies into the ‘live’
city, using guns and other ‘life one’
tools against the humans. ‘Zombies
Bite Back’, you get the picture…
Frankly, you do not buy tickets for
‘Land of the Dead’ and expect an
enlightening experience. However,
it is not wrong to at least expect
the film to be entertaining. To be
fair, Romero did introduce a new
concept of zombies. The zombies
in this movie are smart and have
the capability to evolve (the hor-
ror!). However, he didn’t expand on
this aspect and focused his film on
lengthy displays of gore. It’s defi-
nitely not a film for the easily-dis-
gusted because despite my frequent
run-ins with Quentin Tarantino pro-
ductions, this is just gross.
Granted, there were a few shock-
ing scenes as expected in a film
with a ‘horror’ title. There were
also a few attempts at humour with
vague references to George Bush.
However, I think the director must
have been confused when he made
this film. The movie is neither a
‘horror’ film nor a comedy. The
storyline was simplistic and would
have reached the audience better as
a comedy but the scriptwriter tried
to make the characters deeper than
they should have been. Hence, he
ruined the movie’s potential to be a
good comedy.
The acting skills of the cast were
wasted in this movie. Simon Baker
is a talented actor and he should
have known better than to have
included this movie in his portfolio.
He did a very good performance
of a misunderstood and ‘shut off
from the world’ hero but this char-
acter is simply misplaced in a movie
of such lack of depth. Cholo (John
Leguizamo) is the cowboy among
the team of raiders who is bent
on getting things his way. He’s a
good-looking fellow and his charac-
ter would have been better placed
in a more thought-provoking film.
The only actor who doesn’t deserve
any honourable mention at all in this
horrible movie, is Kaufman (Dennis
Hopper). His acting was stilted and
jarred with the rest of the cast.
Perhaps if he had been more menac-
ing with his lines, the whole movie
might have been saved. However,

due to his stupid accent, the villain
in this movie is simply more repul-
sive than hate-inspiring.
In a nutshell, ‘Land of the dead’
is simply a waste of money. Readers
should avoid the movie like the
plague unless of course, they are
strangely inspired by scenes of
extreme disgust and mindless vio-
lence (that is worrying). The actors
in the show must have had the fun
of their lives messing around in all
that gore (like children in the mud-
pen) but a fun-to-watch, this movie
is definitely not.

“family guy” portrayals. However,
fifteen minutes into the film, the
plot tightens and the atmosphere
thickens.
For those who have seen the trail-
ers, A History of Violence is not as
action packed as the trailers sug-
gested. It dwells mainly in the char-
acters reflections and relations, built
around abrupt but dispersed gun
totting scenes. The action though,
when it happens, is realistic, fast
paced and brutal, with the audience
being drawn into the intensity of the
real time gore scenes, left to piece
together what they just witnessed in
the blink of an eye.
Credit must go to Mortensen
for accurately playing a character
caught between two personalities
and two lives. The viewer’s sympa-
thises clearly sense the hurt Tom
is going through as he protects his
family both from danger and from
being hurt by the truth. Yet, at the
same time, the no-more-mister-tom-
stall challenges this sympathy and
simultaneously questions the safety
of the family.
The changing relations between
the characters as the plot develops
are well played throughout, with raw
emotions and gritty realism mak-
ing the acting believable. For the
whole length of the film, Mortensen
oozes the “normality” his character
needs to gain the audiences sympa-
thy. Bello is fantastic as the wife in
doubt, and performs her role with a
certain vulnerability that gives her
character importance and appeal.
It must be said though that her
script is rather straightforward and
narrow.
Ed Harris also brilliantly stars in
the rather short lived role as Fogarty,
the man with the key to Tom’s past,
in a quirky and eerie role, suited to
his acting image and his make-up in
film. William Hurt makes an unex-
pected appearance (one to watch
out for) in a simultaneously hilari-
ous but dangerous role.
The biggest failing with this film
though is, in my opinion, the way
the storyline is adapted to the film.
Although the plot contains a few
twists, it is all somewhat predict-
able, and the intro and the end-
ing leave some refinement to be
desired. A little more attention to
detail and a tiny bit more unpredict-
ability would have gone a long way
to make an already very good film
great. Other than that, A History
of Violence is a recommended film,
with very engaging acting and a
satisfying plot.
