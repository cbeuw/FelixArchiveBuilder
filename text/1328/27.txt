Dear Miss Confidentiality,
I
don’t know what to do. I’ve
I
Ifallen in love. No its not a good
I
Ithing. He's a geek, I mean a
I
I
proper NHS specks geek! I'm a
cool chick, not conceited, just you
know... normal. I obviously haven't
acted on these feelings yet, what
would my friends think!? What
should I do, do you have any tips
on how to fall-out-of love?
Jill, 18
Dear Jill,
Have you ever thought that perhaps
fairy tales do come true and that
this could be your frog and with
one kiss he may turn into a prince
charming? However in this case
instead of being the princess who
may have just found her happy
ever after you’re in total danger
of becoming the wicked witch! So
what if he wears NHS glasses, and
is a geek, babe you’re at IC what
were you expecting?? Sorry I don’t
have any magic potions around this
week to make you fall out of love,
it’s just not in my job description. If
you’re really that embarrassed by
his glasses and evident geekiness,
either try a makeover, or dump
the guy. You both will probably be
better off. If you really care about
him and want to make amends, I’d
start being more fair and giving him
a chance, maybe things will work
out and you’ll learn to ignore the
geekiness within. Then again don’t
forget that freshers’ week tends to
heighten emotions, then things will
just fizzle out, you can go your way
and he can happily hop along his.
Dear Miss C,
I
’ve done something a little stu-
I
Ipid. You know everyone says
I
Ithat when you go to university
I
I
you can reinvent yourself. Well
that’s exactly what I did. I’m pre-
tending to be this druggy muso.
The idea was to create this image
that would attract the girls, look at
Pete Dotherty and Kate Moss. The
thing is I’m not really like that at
all, I’m actually quite a shy geeky
guy. I don’t know what to do I’ve
kinda gone too far, and don’t know
how to backtrack, everyone will
think I’m a weirdo. Any ideas?
Matt, 19
Dear Matt,
Oh dear, what have you got your-
self into? Now you say you’ve done
some dumb thing, just how dumb
I’m wondering? If you’ve become
some hardcore druggie and are
regretting it and want to get clean,
there’s plenty of help available, the
national drugs helpline for one! Just
remember when temptation strikes,
its always best to just say no! Don’t
stress. Or if you ended up with a
room full of groupies and did some-
thing you regret? It’s easily sorted,
unless you now have a stalker, in
which case I’d advise a restraining
order. If you’ve not quite gone that
far and are just regretting the trans-
formation? Well mate there’s only
one option, turn back to who you
are. Your first mistake was to rein-
vent yourself, the only time turning
into a stranger will attract girls is
if your James Bond, and only Sean
Connery can really pull that role off.
The best thing to do is to put it all
behind you and be who you’re com-
fortable with. Blame it on the booze
if you must! One of the best things
about uni is that it is a pick and mix
of all sorts of people, and I’m sure
that you’ll find friends’ amongst the
great variety of different sweets.
Don’t worry about people finding
you weird, everyone’s different, and
I’m sure they’ll give you a chance
and find out you’re a great guy who
just went slightly off the rails, but
hey everyone’s allowed a mistake,
don’t punish yourself too much and
just get back on the uni train!
Hey Miss Confidentiality,
I’ve got an itch, an itch down
I
Ithere. I’m scared it might be an
I
I
STI. What should I do?
J
Hey J,
Well well well, look who’s been
misbehaving! Umm, I’m not really
qualified to tell whether that itch
down under, is just because you’ve
been too busy during fresher to
shower and so are just plain gross
or whether you’ve caught some-
thing from someone, no judgment I
promise. I think the best thing is get
down to the GP
, or the NHS walk in
centres and get some tests done. Or
if you’re feeling really open I’d try
chatting to some of the IC medics
around. Now to be helpful I might
just give you a few tips on what to
do in future, it doesn’t take a genius,
whatever and whoever you do, try
and stay clean, it’ll defiantly help
you to attract members of the oppo-
site sex, and secondly… use protec-
tion, I hate to sound like your mum,
but still, it’s you who’s gonna suffer,
that and whoever else you’ve been
fooling around with, I’d watch out
for angry ex partners banging down
your door!
Dear Miss C,
I’m a fresher, who came to uni be-
ing the envy of all her school mate
when they heard about the boy to
girl ratio. Only I find myself severe-
ly disappointed. Where are all the
hot guys hiding, or am a doomed to
spend 3 years in geekland? What do
you suggest?
Cathy
Dear Cathy,
Welcome to the real world? Didn’t
it seem slightly unrealistic that
fate could hand you a 2-to-1 guy to
girl ratio and a roomful of fitness
to take your pick from? Take those
rose coloured glasses off sweetie,
its time to face facts. Unfortunately
you’re not the first to have these
opinions and no you won’t be the
last. Bear in mind IC is known more
for its brains than its brawn which
isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Hey
it give you a chance to either prac-
tise your feminine charms, if you
haven’t already got them perfected
or make some really great mates
who are guys, giving you a chance
to get closer to solving the mystery
that is the male mind. Give the guys
a chance, they aren’t that bad and
maybe they just haven’t shown off
their true Adonis like qualities as
they lost that tan by spending all
their time in library. I spy a makeo-
ver on its way, what better way to
relieve your frustration than by
shopping? What I will say is, that
even in a roomful of geeks you will
always find a diamond amongst the
rough, just get ready for some com-
petition, because most of the female
IC population will be charging the
same way you are. Remember alls
fair in love and war.
Dear Miss C,
I’ve moved into flat with some
friends from halls. My flatmates
are great friends, but bad flat-
mates. I mean they never pitch in
with household chores leaving me
with a clogged sink full of dirty
dishes and nothing to eat off unless
I spend hours scrubbing. I think
what bugs me most is though that
they also never buy any toilet roll,
and use all of mine, it’s beginning
to drive me crazy and I’ve only
been living with them a few weeks,
what do you suggest?
Nisha
Dear Nisha,
Firstly? Calm down and breathe, it’s
only been a few weeks. I’m guess-
ing that you haven’t tried talking
to them about it? The thing is that
if you continue to do their washing
for them and buy them toilet roll,
they probably won’t see a problem,
it’s just like being at home, you may
have just found yourself appointed
flat mum. If you keep going this
way whilst silently plotting their
demise, things aren’t really going to
get much better. The best thing is
to try setting up a cleaning rota and
make everyone pitch in. No one like
chores unless you’re a close rela-
tive of Mr Muscle but hey it’s better
than living in a room full of empty
beer cans and month old MacDon-
ald’s. If you guys are really as close
as you say then I’m sure they’ll
understand and will make some
changes. If not, you could always
go army camp on them giving them
one plate, one fork and one knife
each until they get the point. You
could also try using toilet roll as an
accessory to your outfits, that’s way
you always have some around when
the need arises.
Dear Miss Conﬁdentiality...
Hi kids, welcome to uni! Now
the fun starts, but fun spawns
problems. I’m here to help you
with all the worries you might
have about life at uni and beyond.
Please don’t hesitate to email me,
agony.felix@imperial.ac.uk. I look
forward to hearing from you!
