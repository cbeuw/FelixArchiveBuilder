Greetings one and all and welcome
(back) to Imperial. I trust that you all
enjoyed your summer holidays and are
now keen and eager to begin those
wonderful lectures. What’s that you
say? You’d rather be having fun trek-
king through Snowdonia or playing in
the symphony orchestra? Well, I can’t
say that I blame you; with more clubs
than you can shake a snooker cue at
Imperial is deﬁnitely the place to be if
you want to try something new. For
your delight we have organised Fresh-
ers’ Fayre; a six hour extravaganza
where all 250 clubs and societies are
gathered together, competing for your
attention, all of whom would much
rather that you spent your days with
them rather than wasting your time
in dull, boring lectures, listening to
octogenarians with enormous beards
droning on about Advanced Quantum
Field Theory.
Of course, with so many clubs to
choose from you’ll have to wander
around a bit. On the Queen’s Lawn
you’ll ﬁnd many of the sports type clubs
along with the motor clubs and the
London Fire Brigade’s display team by
the Queen’s Tower (chip pan ﬁres are
really spectacular) and just inside in
the Main Dining Hall there are yet more
sports clubs. Across the road the Sir
Alexander Fleming Building is full of the
Medics’ Union clubs, although anyone
can join them. Upstairs your choice
becomes even wider with the overseas
clubs in the Great Hall, the religious
and political type societies in the Junior
Common Room (JCR) – they serve
a good breakfast in there by the way.
Further along from the JCR (or up the
ramp from the lawn and carpark) is a
wonderful area known as Upper Dalby
Court wherein lies all of the City and
Guilds’ clubs (again anyone can join).
Over in the Union building in Beit, we
have a plethora of recreational, social
and arts clubs ranging across three
ﬂoors and the Quad outside. With
everything from Canoe to Jazz Big
Band via Science Fiction (we have the
largest student run library in Europe)
taking in our television studio (STOIC)
and radio there is sure to be something
that you want to do. As if that wasn’t
enough we also have a stage which will
be teeming with clubs determined to
show you just how great their activ-
ity is; ever fancied ﬁre juggling? And
there are BBQs in the Quad and on the
Queen’s Lawn just in case you get a bit
peckish.
You’re all pretty much spoiled for
choice so don’t waste the opportunity
because “all work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy”. Enjoy the day, relax,
meet some clubs and take pleasure
in the fact that you’ve got no lectures
and by the weekend you’ll be running,
swimming, playing, jumping, reading,
debating, singing or whatever with the
nicest bunch of reprobates that you
ever did meet!
