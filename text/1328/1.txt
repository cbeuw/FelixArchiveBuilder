Due to the demolition of Southside,
Imperial College have leased two
private halls from UNITE, a com-
pany with a patchy record when it
comes to student accommodation.
The £50m redevelopment of
the Southside building in Princes
Gardens had left College short,
some 364 rooms needed to guaran-
tee all first years a place in halls.
College have secured the use of
two private halls for two years, while
building work takes place. Luckily,
given the delays to other building
projects, Imperial have an option for
a third year should building work
be delayed.
The UNITE housing group owned-
halls,arelocatedsomedistancefrom
Imperial’s main South Kensington
campus. Piccadilly Court, is on New
Caledonian road, North London.
The other, Orient House, is locat-
ed in the Imperial Wharf complex,
Chelsea.
Some Imperial freshers are con-
cerned that they may be subjected
to the same “appalling levels of
customer service” experienced by
students in UNITE’s Grand Central
Complex in Liverpool.
The situation in Liverpool was so
dramatic that the story featured in
the national press and on the front
page of Liverpool Student (see page
2).
Felix was assured by UNITE
that “the problems UNITE faced
in Liverpool are a thing of the past,
nothing of the sort will happen at
Piccadilly Court”.
Vasa Curcin, warden of Piccadilly
Court told Felix he “was very pleased
with the new hall and was looking
forward to working with UNITE to
provide the best hall experience”.
No officers from Imperial College
Union made the trip to the opening
of Piccadilly court on 31 August.
Sarah Khatib, Deputy President
(education & welfare), told Felix she
“wasn’t going because it was just
too far away”.
Felix did make the, 43 minute door-
to-door trek from College to the new
hall. Although this is not a statisti-
cally valid estimate, it is likely that
students will spend at least 1 hour 20
minutes commuting everyday.
The hall is fitted out to a high
standard throughout with all mod-
cons. The highlight of which is an
absolutely massive flat screen TV in
the common room.
The hall is arranged in the increas-
ingly popular ‘cluster room’ forma-
tion. This arrangement is similar to
that of the student accommodation
shown on the popular soap opera
Hollyoaks. Each cluster flat con-
tains four or six rooms behind their
own front door. Every flat also has a
open plan kitchen and lounge with
satellite TV.
Despite being so far away, the
rent is comparable to Beit Quad.
Although students in Picadilly court
will have to fork out for a very nec-
cassary travelcard
The private rental costs are con-
siderably more than our students
are paying. College have failed to
respond to numerous requests from
Felix enquiring as to the amount
of subsidy Imperial are paying
UNITE.
Students might not feel as safe
in New Caledonian road as they
do in genteel South Kensington.
There were a total of 3,164 recorded
crimes in the borough of Islington in
the month of August 2005 compared
to 2,445 in Kensington & Chelsea.
Robbery and violence against the
person, crimes which particulary
affect students, are also consider-
ably more common in Islington.

more common in Islington. During
the same period there were 550 inci-
dents of violence against the person
compared to 366 in Kensington.
Also, as Imperial continues to
become a more multicultural envi-
ronment it is worrying that rac-
ist attacks are more than twice as
prevalent in Islington compare to
Kensington.
The crime issue was highlighted
when during the editors brief tour
of the area, he was offered illegal
drugs.
Students will also be neighbours
to Holloway Prison, which houses
soem of the most high profile female
prisoners in the country. Including
Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Ian
Huntley notorious for the Soham
school girls murders.
Although, most students are sure
to be delighted with the facilities of
their new hall. The distance from
College and the Union are likely
to cause some students consider-
able problems. One could imagine
students from these halls finding
it much harder to drag themselves
out of bed for lectures compared to
those who can fall out of bed into
lectures from Beit.

In May 2001 Imperial College
applied to the Privy Council of the
University of London to have its
own degree awarding powers. This
lead to a review by a QAA committee
set up by the council, which in turn
assessed Imperial College’s suit-
ability by carrying out a review.
A paper submitted by Andrew
Smith Deputy President (Education
& Welfare, 2002-03) to Imperial Union
Council on 12 May 2003 discussed the
possibility of setting a policy on the
issue. The paper discussed issues
such as the influence of UL and
the students attitude to receiving
degrees from Imperial College rath-
er than UL. Sameena Misbahuddin,
Imperial College Union President
said “We want student opinion on
this, we will take whatever the stu-
dents want to College”. She said that
the issue would be taken up in the
next meeting of Senate.
The issue has recently become
more important as other Univerisity
of London colleges, including LSE,
Kings and UCL have also applied to
have similar powers and this could
lead to a break up of the University
of London. Kings College student
newspaper ‘ROAR’ has carried a
story on Imperial’s degree awarding
powers, citing that Imperial could
trigger the collapse of the university
of London.
Sir Richard Sykes, the Rector of
Imperial College has said that no
decision has been made yet about
using the powers that have been
awarded, and if any decision is made
it would only affect students enter-
ing Imperial in 2007. An alternative
plan of action could be a compro-
mise where the college has a special
understanding with the University
of London, allowing Imperial to use
its powers yet remain a part of the
UL.
