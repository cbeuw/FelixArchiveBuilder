During the same period there were
550 incidents of violence against
the person compared to 366 in
Kensington.
Also, as Imperial continues to
become a more multicultural envi-
ronment it is worrying that rac-
ist attacks are more than twice as
prevalent in Islington compare to
Kensington.
The crime issue was highlighted
when during the editors brief tour
of the area, he was offered illegal
drugs.
Students will also be neighbours
to Holloway Prison, which houses
soem of the most high profile female
prisoners in the country. Including
Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Ian
Huntley notorious for the Soham
school girls murders.
Although, most students are sure
to be delighted with the facilities of
their new hall. The distance from
College and the Union are likely
to cause some students consider-
able problems. One could imagine
students from these halls finding
it much harder to drag themselves
out of bed for lectures compared to
those who can fall out of bed into
lectures from Beit.
500 students were left
stranded without prom-
ised rooms, food and
laundry services after a
private accommodation
provider failed to com-
plete a hall of residence in
Liverpool city centre.
The UK’s biggest private
landlord, UNITE, were due
to complete its ‘Grand
Central’ complex well
ahead of the autumn influx
of students. Despite Paul
Whitingham, UNITE’s site-
Manager, telling the
Liverpool Student on the
25th July 2003 that the
completion date for the site
is “on schedule”, a combi-
nation of unfinished
rooms, roads and a
builders strike resulted in a
lengthy delay.
Initially, students were
dispersed at various loca-
tions around the city.
Then, on the night of
Saturday 20th September –
a week after students were
supposed to be booked into
their accommodation –
there was an attempt to
move some students into
the incomplete building.
FLOODING
Yet, within hours stu-
dents were evacuated after
the second floor flooded.
Pipes burst and showers
flooded with sewage. Now,
students are living in hotels
in Liverpool, Knowsley and
even Haydock, some 20
miles away from the city’s
universities.
150 students from The
University of Liverpool
(UofL) and 350 students
from Liverpool John
Moores University (JMU)
have been affected by the
calamity, which UNITE has
put down to ‘unforeseen
problems’.
Nick Porter, UNITE Chief
Executive, tried to console
those who have been
affected. “We have learned
from the mistakes made by
others in the past, and we
have put in place plans for
these circumstances. We
apologise to our customers
who have been temporarily
affected and we are doing
our level best to ensure
that our customers come
first and any disruption is
minimised.”
However, those senti-
ments were not enough to
satisfy students and stu-
dent representatives, who
met the awful events with
furious condemnation at
an organised meeting at
Liverpool Students’ Union.

UNITE moved Liverpool students into unfinised halls, September 2003

Despite government targets to
increase the number of state school
students, successful applications
nationwide have fallen since 2000
for the first. Conversly the number
of applicaticates to top universities
from the state sector has increased.
Despite government pressure to
reach benchmark figures the state
school intake has fallen across 16 of
the 19 Russell group Universities.
The Russell group contains the
UK’s leading research-lead univer-
sities, including including Imperial
College.
Thetotalnumberofstudentswitha
state school background at Imperial
has dropped 3% to 59.6% last aca-
demic year. Oxford and Cambridge
have dropped by 1.6% and 0.7%, to
53.8% and 56.9% respectively. With
targets of 75.2% and 75%, current
figures are significantly short of
expectations.
Sir Peter Lampl, a government
advisor on widening participation
has expressed concerns “3,000 stu-
dents from state schools who should
be going to top universities are
not”.
This issue is compounded by the
news that Imperial College intends
to increase the intake of overseas
students. During the top-up fees
debate last year Sir Richard Sykes,
Rector of Imperial College, told
Felix (1323) that the number of over-
seas would continue to increase.
But, he did state that meaures woud
be taken to encourage state school
applicants.
There are arguments that the
benchmark figures are unrealistic
as they are based on the new UCAS
points system. Whereas previous
systems have been based on A level
grades.
Three straight ‘A’ grades at A level
are equivalent to 360 UCAS points.
State school numbers fall
Tanaka cafe open
for business?
Yu Lun Tang
News Editor
Non-business school students have
been been denied access to the cafe
area of Tanaka Business School for
security reasons.
Over the last 12 months, there
has been a persistent and recurring
problem with the theft of computers
from the area. Susie Haywood, Public
Relations Officer for the Business
School told Felix that “as the demand
for computers is continually growing,
it has become increasingly difficult
to replace stolen computers, there
is no other alternative but to restrict
access to the cafe area.”
She stressed that the restriction
is only for security purposes and
there is no secret agenda. The move
has prompted fierce opposition from
the City & Guilds Union. The deci-
sion has been received as another
attempt to distinguish the Business
School from the rest of the college.

Although most students think its a
good idea for Imperial to award its
own degrees, the ramifications are
less clear. Most students believe that
Imperial is more popular than the
University of London and hence bet-
ter recognised.
A Senior union officer speaking to
Felix said that leaving the University
of London Union (ULU) would leave
Imperial without any influence on
the issues that might affect students
nationwide, including an increase
in the tuition fees for home stu-
dents. This might result in Imperial
College Union with little choice than
to join the National Union of students
(NUS) to get it’s voice heard.
UL pullout
The problem arises, becuase there
are a wide range of qualifications
that can tally-up. Students who col-
llect points in this way may not be
as equipped for top universities as
those with three A grades.
A spokesperson for Imperial
College has suggested that it is
not the role of universities to lower
entry requirements to increase
social diversity as this would be
unfair. “The problem lies much ear-
lier in the system. Universities can-
not be expected to address issues of
schooling, peer pressure and fam-
ily expectations that are the main
barriers to participation for many
young people.”
The statement also mentioned
entrance to College solely depends
on academic merit regardless of
background, though efforts have
been made to accommodate those
who are from the poorest back-
grounds, offering scholarships on a
sliding scale according to the stu-
dent’s received fee support. “We run
a number of initiatives aimed at
encouraging aspiration and achieve-
ment amongst young people who
may not otherwise consider higher
education and have well-established
links with local schools, overseen by
the recently appointed Director of
Access.”
