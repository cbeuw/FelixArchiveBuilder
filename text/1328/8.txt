alone.
Firstly, ‘Pride and Prejudice’ is
a period film that would not have
benefited in any way from the new
technologies that have appeared
in today’s movie industry. Granted,
the cinematography in the latest
version is breathtakingly beautiful.
The shots of the English moors and
the countryside were nothing less
than inspiring. However, ‘Pride and
Prejudice’ is more than a discovery
programme. Amazing cinematogra-
phy is not an excuse to remake this
movie.
The second question we should
address is the apparent dearth of
literature in today’s world that must
have led to the exhausted remake
of ‘Pride and Prejudice’. Have we
simply lost our story-spinning touch
since the invention of the Internet?
Granted, ‘Pride and Prejudice’ is a
classic and the remake has probably
helped keep it from disappearing
from the literary world.
Jane Austen, like Oscar Wilde
firstly fools the readers into decid-
ing who the bad guy is from the very
beginning only to be proven wrong
when the plot unravels. However,
there are also new pieces of lit-
erature with amazing new plots and
angles such as ‘The Time-Traveller’s
Wife’. Why are we looking in the past
for inspiration when we have inspi-
ration right here?
‘Pride and Prejudice’ is a brilliant
satire of the ridiculous customs and
worries that plagued the female spe-
cies in that period of time. However,
what worries me is the fact that
none of the female population of
today’s world gets Jane Austen’s
P
ride and Prejudice, eve-
rybody has heard about it.
Guys hate it but the girls
love it. In fact, the old plot
of the misunderstanding
that soon clears up to allow true
love through is recurrent theme in
romantic comedies. Just to name a
few, there is ‘How to lose a guy in 10
days’ and the ever-popular ‘Bridget
Jones’ Diary’. The original version
of ‘Pride and Prejudice’ (which was
3 hours long) which followed the
exact sequence of the story written
by Jane Austen shot Colin Firth to
stardom. The latest one must have
been expected to blast both Keira
Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen
to stardom as well.
However, the question that
plagues me is not the quality of the
remake but rather the point behind
the remake. The story of Mr. Darcy
and Elizabeth Bennet was written
more than a hundred years ago and
despite the fact that it still strikes a
chord with today’s audience, has it
simply been overdone? In our gen-
eration, where scriptwriters look to
novels for inspiration, (remember
‘Lord of the rings’?) perhaps ‘Pride
and Prejudice’ should have been left

arts.
Pride and Prejudice gets another makeover...but does it really need one?
message in this movie. Just look at
this month’s cover of Cosmopolitan
for proof. I’d like to believe her real
message was not the love story but
the female species’ ridiculous obses-
sion with betrothal. Why must we be
in such a hurry to get hitched? Is it
only through marriage that women
become complete? We have come
such a long way since the women
of those times. Why do we still look
at betrothal as the only way we can
be accepted in today’s society? Has
nothing changed at all?
To be honest, this remake of ‘Pride
and Prejudice’ was the best remake
I’ve ever seen. Keira Knightley

brought a softer, more vulnerable
side to Elizabeth Bennet’s character
that helped endear her to today’s
audience. Matthew MacFadyen was
definitely more ‘lost’ than Colin
Firth was ‘uptight’ in this remake.
However, MacFayden is a dear and
he has the cutest puppy-dog eyes.
As he strides across the moor in
his semi-transparent white shirt
and billowing black coat, there is
no one that has better screen pres-
ence than he does as Mr. Darcy. If
I had not seen the original version
and have not been a fan of the book,
I would have been totally awed by
the on-screen chemistry that flowed
between the two of them.
‘Pride and Prejudice’ is but over-
done beef, tough and hard to swal-
low. What we need in today’s film
world is a new angle and possi-
bly a full stop to women’s obses-
sion with getting married. We are
women, hear us roar! And if you are
not yet inspired, take some time off
to listen to Natasha Bedingfield’s
‘Single’. Maybe once we actually
cease our obsession with marriage,
Jane Austen will cease to turn over
in her grave.

All hail the new Stiﬀmeister!
Tad Hilgenbrick speaks up about American Pie 4
The wedding’s over so what’s
left of the motley crew? This
time around, the focus is on Matt
Stifler (Tad Hilgenbrick). Matt
Stifler is the younger brother of
Steve Stifler (Stiffmeister) and
he gets sent for the ultimate
‘band camp’ experience. To live
up to his reputation as the next
Stiffmeister, Matt attempts to
wire the camp with hidden cam-
eras to turn it into the set for
his own “Girls Gone Wild”-type
video. However Cupid’s arrow
strikes Matt and he falls for fel-
low campie Elyse. American Pie
4 is the next set of gags in this
famous series as Matt tries to
stifle his Stiffmeister urges in the
name of true love.
What was your first reaction to
the making of a fourth American
Pie film?
I knew there was a lot of pressure
for the film to fill the shoes of the
first three but I thought it was a
great idea to continue the legacy.
It was something which I grew
up with and the whole purpose of
the film was to make people laugh
hard so I jumped at the opportunity
to continue this legacy and I think
most people will agree after watch-
ing the film that it was a success.
The film set up cussing in its finest
sense and it really is very funny.
In the film you play Stifflers broth-
er, how was it trying to work as a
character expected to live up to
Stifflers reputation?
Everybody who loves the American
Pie films will definitely have a love
for Stiffler so trying to create a
character similar to his was obvi-
ously going to be very difficult. I
had to study the Sean William Scott
‘s classic films to try and work on
some of his quirks, there is a love
side of the story but a lot of Sean’s
mannerisms are still there.
Do the American pie films give a
good representation of student life
in America?
There is a surprisingly large
amount of work but there is a big
party aspect to it. I think its more
of either one extreme or the other.
People are either working really
hard or going out and getting com-
pletely wasted with beer bongs.
The women aren’t all as gorgeous
as these films make out but some
are really really hot. Guess it’s like
anywhere really.
How does the American youth
imagine typical British students?
I dunno, posh? Playing Polo?
Hanging out with Prince William
(laughs). No, seriously, I studied
acting in London for six months at
a school near St. Pauls and it was
six of the best months of my life.
There was a place in the neigh-
bourhood called the Duke, it was a
fantastic pub and every night you
would see exactly the same people
in there. I even went back recently
and recognised the bar man. I’d
love to come back to London and
spend some more time here, its
such a great place and the nightlife
is awesome.
Rock on Matt Stifler!
