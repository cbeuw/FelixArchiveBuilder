BY ALEX FEAKES
St Mary's Hospital students have
called upon I C U to make a rep-
resentation to Kensington and
Chelsea Borough to try to block
planning permission for the new
Basic Medical Sciences building.
They are continuing to raise
objections over the small alloca-
tion for student social space in
the new centre.
However, representatives of
St Mary's, including President
Sarah Edwards, said at Tuesday's
Union Council meeting that they
were keen to avoid antagonis-
ingthe College by making an
appearance at the planning meet-

Emily Baldock.
In a letter sent to every uni-
versity's union in the country,
Miss Baldock urges students
everywhere to oppose any move
toward top-up fees by universi-
ties. The fees are proposed by
some institutions as a means to
claw back some of the money
cut in last November's budget.
The cuts commonly amount to
about 7% of a university's
income, and could mean up to
Â£500 being sought from stu-
dents.
The DSU's President goes
on to say that the aim of the
action day, scheduled for 29th
February, is to 'establish a
national campaign to get the
recent budget cuts into the news
and make the general public
aware'. She has suggested vari-
ous non antagonistic methods of
achieving this, including organis-
ing demonstrations, collecting
signatures for a petition from
the public and lobbying the non-
