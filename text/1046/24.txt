Italians storm OSC basketball
The joint Italian-Spanish team
slaughtered all of the opposition
in Saturday's first-round O S C
basketball tournament.
The size of the Union gym
limited teams to play only four a
side, but the decaying backboards
and rims did not stop the teams
from enjoying the tournament.
All the games were highly com-
petitive and even aggressive at
times.
The Italian-Thai game was
finely balanced, with many suc-
cessful outside shots from the
Thais. But with the help of Alex
Cinelli's re-direction and fancy
moves, the Italians made an
amazing come back and won. The
Indians put up a brave fight, esp-
ecially in their last game against
the Italians who were by now
unstoppable. Credit must also be
given to the Mauritian attempt.
The Thai and Italian teams
will now pass to the next round.
The most interesting game may
be the Italy-Greece game: both
are strong teams, and although
the Greeks have a little more
experience, after this round's
performance the Italians look
capable of anything.

When the game eventually
started we dominated the first
half, with brilliant football and
only excellent defence by the
not so 'old' boys kept the score
to 2-1. The second half saw a
missed penalty (by Keith) and
some tired legs. They capitalised
and scored to give the game a
deserved 3-3. We would like to
thank the old boys for an enjoy-
able Sunday
R S M I 4 - 2 Q M W III
After being 1-0 down for
sixty minutes, all of the team
gave 120% to pull the game back
to 4-2, with a hat-trick (Keith
again), and one for Digger.
We dominated both halves
and were the rightful winners,
however Q M W kept the game
alive and certainly deserved
more for their efforts.

RCS win again! A combination
of good scrummaging, especially
in the second half and superb
play by the three-quarters led to
a half-time lead of 8-0 (try by
Ben, penalty by Justin). Despite
domination in the second half,
in both possession and territory,
several tries went begging,
although Simon managed to
ground one. Overall, the score
did not reflect the pattern of the
game... but we still won!
A big hand to John Savery at
hooker (man of the match), and
Hunter (Harvey) for his impres-
sive Christmas pectorals.
