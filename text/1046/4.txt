Rag Chair owns up to poor Rag Week total
BY A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
IC Rag said this week that they
raised £920 from last term's Rag
Week. According to Rag Chair
Jon Lambert, the R C S U Beer
Festival broke even, and the
Slave Auction, organised in con-
junction with the C & G Union,
raised £180, "despite there being
none of the sabbaticals". The Pub
Crawl raised £50 lor Leukemia
research. They also collected
£690 from collections after con-
certs, which will go to breast can-
cer research, the deaf/blind char-
ity Sense and Mencap. However
the total was well down on last
year's of more than £5000 (Felix
1011).
Although this year's top col-
lector, Andy Southern, raised
£362.71, M r Lambert himself
said that this time last year he
had raised around £1000 by him-
self.
On being asked whether he
was disappointed with Rag's tak-
ings this year, he told Felix,
"We've done as well as we could
have under the circumstances
due to a bad start last term, and
being without a chair up to the
Beer Festival." He took over the
Rag chair after the previous
incumbent, Richard Willis,
resigned amidst allegations of
"bringing the Union into disre-
pute" for serving spirits at a Rag

event.
"All things considered, £920
is a very good total for a week."
He added that there had been
organisational problems with the
Beer Festival. Attendance was
lower than last year, due to a
clash with a major sports event
on the Wednesday afternoon. Jon
did admit that a "bad press" may
have helped cause this. "It went
as well as could be expected," he
insisted.
Forthcoming events include
the City and Guilds Carnival and
the Rag tour, where copies of the
Ragmag will be sold at other uni-
versities. He stated that this
year's edition was not as contro-
versial as last year's, which pro-
voked a storm over its notorious
photographs of mutilated geni-
talia: "It doesn't have the pictures
of last year but the humour is
better... the shock factor isn't
there."
