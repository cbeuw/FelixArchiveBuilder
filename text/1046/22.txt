Dear Editor,
The Government of this
country has recently gone to
great lengths to inform us that
British beef is safe to eat. The
medical profession seem to be
divided on this one, some say that
they themselves steer clear
(excuse the pun), others claim
the evidence is insufficient to
convince them that beef is
unsafe. What does the public do?
Largely, it ignores the Govern-
ment and finds solace in agree-
ment with some medical people
and stop eating beef.
The Government of this
country has recently informed us
that it is safe to drink more alco-
hol than we have been. The med-
ical profession seems unaminous
on its disagreement with this
statement and clearly tells us that
it is a poison to the liver and
should not be drunk in anything
like the quanaties the
Government now stipulates as
safe. What does the public do?
Largely, it ignores the medical
people and finds solace in agree-
ment with the Government and
goes and gets pissed.
The Government of this
country has recently reinformed
us of the dangers of taking drugs,
even the popular youth drug
ecstasy. The medical profession
seems to wholeheartedly agree
with this line. The police also
strongly encourage abstention
from drug taking, as the dangers
to the user have been graphically
highlighted, and the immoral
activities that drug money funds
are becoming more apparent.
What does the public do? Well it
seems divided on this one.
Parents seem worried about
drugs and try to educate their
kids, but many young people
ignore the Government and the
medical people and go out and
get stoned.
Do I have a conclusion? Well
I suppose it shows that people do
whatever they like, but try. to
look to an authorative voice to
justify their decision, and if one
can't be found then they just
place themselves on superior
ground and assume nobody else
knows what they are talking
about. Do I have a recommenda-
tion? If you drink in excess then
stop! If you are doing drugs then
stop! Beef? no comment!

A bit of a mouthful just to come
to a point about not doing drugs,
don't you think?

Dear Felix,
RE: The positive net benefits
of working with radioactivity.
Without the use of radioac-
tive tracers research in the bio-
logical, biochemical and medical
fields, our understanding of dis-
eases and the ability to cure
would be severly hampered.
These can be used in minute
amounts and they can be targeted
to specific molecular sites.
Radioactivity can also be used in
hospitals as a cure in cancer treat-
ments and as a diagnostic tool.
Natural radioactivity is with all
the time: it is present in the
