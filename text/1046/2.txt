News in brief
R C S U anger
over office move
BY A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
The Royal College of Science
Union has been voicing concern
over its move to the Civil
Engineering Department. The
old office was located at the back
of the Old Chemistry Building,
which is due to be demolished to
make way for the new B M S
block. A temporary office was set
up in the Biology department
before Christmas, but this must
be vacated at the end of the
month. They R C S U will then
move to new offices, currently
being prepared in Civ Eng.
The R C S U President, M o
Dulloo, said that initially the
plans for the move had been well
organised. "Estates figured out
the plan last term, and the plans
for the office [in Civ Eng] were
pretty damn smart... on the
whole it was good." However, he
was concerned that College was
proceeding very quickly with the
development at the expense of
full consultation with the R C S U .
Problems first surfaced over
their Motor Club garage, in
which their fire engine, jez, is
stored. "At that particular point
in time, they assured us that Jez
wouldn't have to be moved," Mo
said, and added that on the last
day of term, the college Fire
Officer, Graham Cox, told them
that they would be able to move
the vehicle to a Chelsea garage in
January.
Then on December 19th
they were told that Jez would
have to be moved the iollowing
day: "they pulled a fast one on us
big time... It took a whole day
with a dozen people, and at such
short notice... it was fucking stu-
pid." He added that some ex-stu-
dents had taken the day off work
to come and help out.
It has also emerged that dur-
ing the Christmas Holiday,
Deputy President (Finance &
Services) Matt Crompton, was
asked by the Estates Division to
move the RCSU's equipment
out of storage in Southside,
although they later relented on
the grounds that there was
nowhere else to put the equip-
ment and that the storeroom
would require "at least 12 man-
days" to clear out.
The R C S U office is set to
move out of its current premises
at the end of the month. Initially
uncertain of their office's new
location, M o said, "My impres-
sion is that we'll be homeless",
though he has since learned that
work at the Civ Eng site is pro-
gressing well and may be com-
plete by the the time the R C S U
office is required to move.

the site were keen to complete
the garage area by this Friday,
and the office itself in a couple of
weeks.
The R C S U President never-
theless remains angry with the
manner in which the Estates
Division have handled their
move. H e said, "We'll move,
we'll move again, my concern is
that we have a working office."
He assured Felix that the
RCSU's administration and
organisation of events had been
unaffected.

Security deputy-
Kenneth Weir, who took the job
of Deputy Head of Security at
the beginning of this term after
Terry Briley had to take an
extended leave of absence, has
urged students who have lost
property to check with them.
Items waiting to be claimed are
kept for three months before
they are disposed of, and there is
a lot of property yet to be
claimed which will soon reach
the disposal date.
Mr. Weir also stressed that
lost swipe cards are liabilities
until they are deactivated. H e
added that security should be
informed at the earliest opportu-
nity after losing one - if found,
cards can easily be reactivated at
security control.
Student survey
A student survey conducted at
the beginning of last term could
form the basis for how the South
Kensington campus looks in a
few years time. The survey ques-
tioned returning second year stu-
dents on their opinions regarding
various aspects of life at IC. The
survey asked questions on the
quality of the student accommo-
dation, and the services provided
around college.
The results of the question-
naire have been released to Felix
and make interesting reading, the
sample of approximately 700
students representing a return of
39% on the survey.
Although the majority
thought that student rents in
west London were too expensive,
they were unwilling to share
rooms in order to save money.
However, most of the students
wouldn't mind doing their own
cleaning if it meant paying less
rent, and most would want to
live in halls again in their second
year. 60 students even preferred
not to clean their rooms at all!
The college catering service
did not come in for as high praise
as the halls, a considerable pro-
portion having used neither
Basics nor Southside Bar.
However, the ex-Linsteadians
amongst the group wholeheart-
edly condemned the service in
Linstead's dining room.
Clearly most students here
keep their money under their
beds, as a high proportion rated a
bank as being the most important
retail outlet to have on campus.
Surely "that Bank"'s advertising
can't have been so low-key?
After the bank, a chemist and a
Post Office were the most popu-
lar amenities.
Students were offered an
incentive to reply to the ques-
tionnaire, in the form of a prize
draw for a £25 gift voucher. Felix
can reveal the winner as P
Linkshwaran from C i v Eng.
Congratulations, P.
IC Prof on TV
Professor Michael Rowan-
Robinson of the Physics depart-
ment was on television on
Tuesday evening talking about
the Hubble Space Telescope.
The telescope had been left on
for ten days pointing at the same
place, and had caught an amazing
1500 galaxies on film. Professor
Rowan-Robinson was called on to
explain some of the features of
the photograph, and its relevance
to his research group's work.
Dropout rates up
National newspapers reported
this week that student drop-out
rates across the country were up
by 10% on last year, and those
leaving due to failed exams grew
by 20%.
The main reason for the
increase was said to be financial
pressures, which forced students
to work to raise extra cash and
therefore spend less time on
their studies.
It's... YOU!
Someone, somewhere at IC has
won an awful lot of money
(£90k) on the lottery. It seems
that scientific method might be
the best way to choose those
numbers.
Fancy buying us all a pint?
