Top-up fees face student opposition
continued from front page
academic world through various
media.
Although Imperial College is
set to be £2 million worse off
next year, it is unlikely to charge
top-up fees to its home students,
having calculated that it could
match the funding loss by attract-
ing more overseas students.
However, the fact that the
College has done its homework
on this matter suggests that they
are taking the threat seriously
and have been looking at the posi-
tion thoroughly. Also, last year is
thought to have been a good one
for the College, leaving it in a
financially strong position this
year.
Others in the Russell Group
of universities and colleges have
not been quite so lucky, Imperial
being the only one to come out
strongly against top-up fees. For
example, Manchester will almost
certainly have to introduce some
form of additional funding, much
to the dismay of its Student's
Union. Speaking to Felix, Simon
Webber, General Secretary of
Manchester SU, outlined their
opposition to the scheme, saying
that they would prefer the uni-
versity to take fewer students
next year, in order to leave some
slack for the system to take up.
He stressed that although this is
intended to reduce the burden on
the student, it would also be nec-
essary to establish an "equitable
and fair system of student finan-
cial support for, the long term
future" to meet the challenge,
and they would be working with
the university to achieve this.
Mr Webber stated that a let-

A spokesman for the Association
of University Teachers has
likened the reduction of universi-
ty funding to to the closure of
seven major universities or the
loss of 6,500 lecturers' jobs.
The cuts are based on the
government's assumption that
universities can increase their
efficiencies, but according to the
A U T , this was an attempt to
deceive the general public and to
disguise the scale of the cuts. The
A U T also condemned the two-
pronged push toward private
funding of higher education,
namely capital for university
development and maintenance
and student loan privatisation, as
a 'double disaster'.
The government also
expects Universities to recoup
the cuts through private funding.
However, the A U T believes that
the cuts are so severe - over 50%
in the next three years - that this
would be impossible. It also
believes that a private company
run in this fashion would quickly
go bankrupt.
The funding cuts are widely
expected to lead to lecturer
redundancies and pay freezes.
However, lecturer's unions,
including the A U T , say they have
little choice but to push for "sub-
stantial" pay increases, in order
to reduce the growing pay differ-
ence between their members and
those in comparable jobs.
Tom Wilson, assistant gener-
al secretary of the A U T , said: "If
this, or some other token of
goodwill, is not forthcoming then
we will not take it lying down."
ter had been drafted, to be sent
to the Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) in time for their next
meeting, and that he hoped it
would be signed by the
Presidents of all the SUs in the
Russell Group. The letter sets
out the student's objections to
top-up fees, pointing out that
there have been few issues which
have united Student Unions to
such a great extent, which
demonstrated its importance to
those in higher education. This
move is unrelated to that of
Durham's S U ; Manchester,
although supportive, prefers to
encourage the lobby of the
C V C P , seen as the only body
which might persuade universi-
ties not to introduce top-up fees
and thus escape the corner into
which the Government has paint-
ed them.
Sarah White was uncertain
of the action day's possible
impact, commenting that it was
"not really our style." However,
she did emphasise ICU's strong
opposition to top-up fees, and
agreed that something really
ought to be done about it.
Thieves in computer centre
BY M A R K BRIDGE
The new year started badly
for Mech Eng when thieves broke
in on the 12th and helped them-
selves to valuable computer com-
ponents. The thieves systemati-
cally removed chips from
machines in the Workstation
Systems Room on the fourth
floor Computer Centre at about
6pm. The stolen parts have been
valued at around £5000.
The Deputy Head of the
Computer Centre, Arthur
Spirling, said that the main tar-
gets were memory chips. These
are compact and can cost up to
£100 per Mb chip, making them
extremely attractive to thieves.
An SGI-1 type and three other
Iris type machines were dam-
aged. The SGI was polled at 6:05
but failed to reply, timing the
incident around then (machines
are polled at intervals of just
under five minutes). The proces-
sors were also removed along
with the boards in some
machines. The large L-shaped
room was occupied by one work-
er at the time.
Kenneth Weir, Deputy Head
of Security, said that the perpe-
trators entered and left through
the room's fire escape door. Mr.
Weir said that Closed Circuit
Television does not cover the
area at the moment and so other
avenues of investigation are in the
initial stages of being pursuit.
The SGIs may have been tar-
geted because they have more
memory than PC's. Additionally,
the PC rooms are more likely to
be occupied during the evening.
Security Success in
Southside
Yesterday lunchtime an intrud-
er was discovered in Southside
halls. A n Asian man in his
twenties was seen by a number
of students, who discovered
soon afterwards that one of
their stereo systems was miss-
ing.
They quickly notified col-
lege security, who found the
man in another part of the
halls. As Felix went to press,
police were on site and the
stereo system, found in a near-
by bathroom, was waiting to be
fingerprinted.

understanding" why students are
complaining so much now, insist-
ing that the provision for student
space was agreed with I C U dur-
ing the summer of 1995. He
maintains that the project is still
on schedule.
Planning permission will be
considered at a Kensington and
Chelsea Borough meeting later
this month. College say they are
confident that there will be no
problems with their application
for demolition of the old chem-
istry building.
The medics have had consid-
erable success raising awareness
about their concerns with staff at
St Mary's, as well as among alum-
ni of the school and the governors
of Imperial College, and they
insist that this will strengthen
their cause.
