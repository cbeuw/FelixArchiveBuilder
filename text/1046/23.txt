ground as uranium and thorium
and it is in our bodies as potassi-
um-40. If the use of radioactivity
is potentially beneficial, how are
we to regulate the resulting dis-
charges of very small amounts
into the environment?
Public concern arises from
the current view that the radia-
tion effects are linear down to
the smallest dose and can be
harmful. This must, however, be
seen in perspective with other
risks and with the percieved ben-
efits. There are more data on the
effects of radiation than for any
other pollutant and this allows
discharges to the environment to
be strictly regulated. A risk
assessment for the discharges
must be made for the research
before the regulator (HMIP) will
issue an authoristaion. Each dis-
charge route must be assessed
individually.
The safest means of disposal
is storage of solid wastes (tissues,
glassware etc), contaminated
with short-lived activity, to allow
the activity to disappear by
decay. However for liquid waste,
the safest approved disposal
route is by the drains since in
this way the trace radioactivity is
dispersed and diluted while it
decays. Risk assessments might
lead typically to an exposed indi-
vidual receiving less than 1% of
their average annual background
dose. You might say that this is
more than it should be, but do
you worry when you travel from
the Cotswolds to Aberdeen and
increase your radiation dose by
300%? It is a matter of perspec-
tive and risk versus benefit.
Margaret Minski, IC Rad-
iation Protection Advisor.
Yes, but what about the report
in Time Out? You infer that IC
has a licence to dispose of radio-
active waste, but the College
has denied dumping any. I think
we should be told...

I was really pleased to get a
phone call from Ian Caldwell's
office first thing on Monday
morning. We are now to meet up
on a regular basis, and I shall
endeavour to keep up to date
with the state of play of the great
Imperial house extension.
It's really hard to know what
to make of it all: I feel I should-
n't say this, but it's quite possible
that the Director of Estates is
actually quite a reasonable man.
That doesn't seem to be the cur-
rent viewpoint of the St Mary's
medics. But I can't help feeling
that we're rather letting our-
selves down, that our 'too little
too late' protestations come over
as being complaint for the sake
of it. I wonder if we just sound
faintly petulant, and whether the
incoherent voice of the Imperial
Student actually has any credi-
bility at all.
We are in serious danger of
having a real shortage of student
facilities in a couple of years'
time. College wanted to build a
sizeable new area of social space
in the Sherfield Building. It
would have had bars, restaurants,
and meeting rooms, as well as
shops and welfare offices. Okay,
so the location wasn't great, but
quite frankly it would have been
a sizeable improvement on stick-
ing with the decidedly tatty run-
down facilities that we have at
present. They are already unable
to cope with the size of the pre-
sent population, even before we
have hoards of beery medics
descending upon us.
The unspoken attitude
amongst the College decision
makers seems to be that they
tried, and we rejected it, and
that embarrassed them, and so
we don't get another chance.
Although that's quite clearly an
unreasonable attitude, because
they, simply couldn't afford the
'Sherfield option', it really does-
n't look likely that I C U will be
able to expand in Beit Quad. The
massive financial undertaking
that is the current estates strate-
gy quite simply has to be
financed by revenue from con-
ferences over the summer.
Bedrooms equals cash - some-
thing of the order of Â£2000 per
year per bed. So they simply can-
not afford to sacrifice bedspaces
in Beit Quad for the sake of a
larger student bar. I think we
should worry.

Who the hell was it who
took my underwear from the

Have you any idea how much
