Comedy
Finally, Corky and The Juice Pigs are touring
the universities of the U K . One can't help
but wonder why they waited so long? We
asked Sean Cullea, member of the group, to
shed a little light on the subject:
"It comes down to fear really. I'm afraid
of leaving the house. A n d I'm afraid of
people coming into the house. Sometimes I
sit weeping on the toilet, afraid to flush it for
fear that it will break down and I'll have to
call the plumber and the plumber will scare
me."
Greg Neale had a different opinion:
"I am stupid and I don't like the idea of
smart intelligent people looking at me. Also
I'm a chronic bed wetter."
Phil Nichol was the only one who had a
positive view about universities:
"I'm certain they exist. What form they
might take is anyone's guess. Probably
vaguely humanoid with a large cafeteria."
Although the Juice Pigs have opinions
about colleges and universities in Britain,
one thing is for certain, they will soon be
visiting this one, bringing their own brand of
surreal satire in a duffle bag woven of
children's dreams. See them now before
they drink the potion and become invisible.

Tamil Society
The International Tamil Society are holding
their annual cultural event for the third time
this year on the 26th of January at 7pm in
Great Hall, Sherfield Building. Amongst the
many programmes to be performed by
talented artistes are Dance, Music and
Drama. A brief description of the evening's
performances is given below:
Karnatic Vocal - Classical Music
This is a form of singing normally
praising the Lord or the Tamil Language and
expresses one's feelings towards the piece
being sung. It involves the interaction of the
voice with instruments such as the violin and
miruthangam.
Bharatha Natyam
The dance of the Tamils is known as
Bharatha Natyam. The word signifies 'Bha'
for Bhavam (expression), 'Ra' for Raga
(music), 'Tha' for Thalam (rhythm) and
'Natyam'(Dance). It was originally a temple
dance and dates back to 2nd Century A D
Most of the themes for this dance are
selected from Hindu mythology.
Drama - Santhathigal (Generations)
This describes a typical Tamil family
like thousands of others who have fled their
homeland Jafflia, Northern SriLanka since
1984. They have left behind their
knowledge, culture, talents, dreams and
come to a strange land under the title
'Refugees'. 'Generations' shows how one
such family has adapted to life in the U K .
This drama has proven to be a great success
and is staged here for the Tamil Society for
the sixth time!
Music Band - Chitralaya
A feast of eastern and western
instruments will accompany the young and
talented Tamil singers in the U K as they sing
some of the most popular cinema songs.
A lot of effort has been put in by our
members to make this event a great success.
We hope to send the money raised to
the displaced people - especially children
who are suffering from lack of medication
and sanitation in the Northern province of
SriLanka. You too can contribute. Tickets
are available at the door and from all society
members.
