Exhibit your talent!
(sounds promising...)
On the 26 February we are having our
Annual Photographic Exhibition at Imperial
College, held in the anteroom of the
Sherfield Building.
We are planning to show you our
different contemporary ideas through our
photographs. There will be a variety of
photographs (black & white as well as
colour) on display, incorporating a wide
range of techniques.
It is a chance for you to see the world
(literally) through our eyes!
For those of you who wish to exhibit
photographs with us or just socialise, it is not
late to join the photographic society. You
can come and meet us in the Southside
Lounge on Tuesdays at 1:00pm.
