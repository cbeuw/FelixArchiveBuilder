Study Criticises Exam Marking Thefts in
Physics
Building
BY MIKE INGRAM
Students' degree levels can be
affected simply by who marks their
papers, according to a study by two
psychologists from Plymouth
University.
The study, conducted by
Professor Stephen Newstead and Dr
Ian Dennis, found significant
differences in the marks given by
individual examiners to the same
essays. On one essay, their verdicts
ranged from 50% to 85% (ie from a
third/lower second to a first class
degree). The smallest range of
marks given to an essay was 46% to
59%. Even this represents the
difference between a student getting
a third or a borderline upper second
class degree.
The study was carried out using
tests on fourteen university external
examiners from all over the country.
The examiners were asked to mark
six papers by third year psychology
students. They were given clear
instructions on what to look for and
how marks should be allocated on a
specific scale.
The study report, published in
the Bulletin of the British
Psychological Society, criticised the
differences in assessing students'
work: "The results are disturbing. It
seems clear that the markers disagree
as to what individual pieces of work
are worth."
Although the report acknowl-
edged that the effect of inconsistent
marking diminished when three
essays from each student were
assessed, it questioned the use of
external examiners to ensure
consistent standards across
institutions: "The research suggests
that we may have put greater faith
in the external examiner system
than it warrants."
These examiners are the
guardians of academic standards so
it is reasonable to expect some
consistency in the marks awarded."
The external examiner system is
an integral part of student
assessment at Imperial College.
Students' papers are marked by two
separate examiners, who are chosen
by departments. Markers are issued
with University of London
guidelines on how examinations are
run, as well as marking schemes for
the papers. Although there are no
College or University standards for
marking schemes, all written papers
must be approved by external
examiners.
The external examiners are
appointed for periods of 3 years by
the College Board of Studies on the
recommendation of departments.
They must also be approved by the
University. The examiners sit on the
College examining boards, as well
as examination subcommittees (eg
in departments). They also have
access to any individual pieces of
students' work. Marks must be
approved by several levels of
examining committees before being
finalised. This is intended to ensure
fairness.
In an interview with Felix,
Vernon McClure, Academic
Registrar, said that the College
examination system ensured
adequate protection from inconsis-
tent marking.
He admitted that "marking is
subjective. There are no two ways
about it", adding that "there are
checks and balances" within the
system to ensure fairness.
A female member of staff was
injured in a robbery in the Physics
department last Friday.
An assailant grabbed the staff
member's handbag and, after trying
to wrench it from her grasp, kicked
her in the leg. He then ran off,
dropping the bag.
The assailant is described as a
white male, about 6ft tall, with a
slim build and blond-ginger hair.
Any suspicious activity within
College should be reported
immediately to Sherfield Security
on extension 3372.
A second theft took place in the
same building on Friday afternoon.
It happened in an office that had
been left unlocked and unattended.
College Security are reiterating
their advice that all offices in
College should be locked when left
unoccupied. Posters giving crime
prevention information have also
been placed around College.
