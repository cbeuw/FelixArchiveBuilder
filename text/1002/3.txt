Student
Debt to
Increase
Rector Replies to Petition
Halls in Evelyn Gardens, where some residents are protesting over lack of common room space.
Many students will fall into debt as
soon as they arrive at university
this year, according to the National
Union of Students (NUS).
The NUS has predicted that
many universities will raise accom-
modation fees by more than the
current rate of inflation. This may
push fees above the level of the full
student grant, meaning students
would have to have other funding
to be able to pay them. Some
observers have predicted that large
numbers of students will be forced
into taking out an overdraft or loan
in order to survive throughout the
early part of the year.
The predictions come after the
Government's announcement
earlier this year that it is to cut the
level of student grants by 10%
annually, starting from September.
Jim Murphy, the NUS
President-elect, sees the problem as
getting worse: "With a further grant
cut of 20% over the next two years,
some students will soon be lucky if
they can even afford two terms'
rent without borrowing."

The Rector has replied in an open
letter to protests from residents of
two Evelyn Gardens halls over lack
of common room space.
Residents of Holbein and Willis
Jackson halls organised a petition in
protest at the inadequate combined
common room facilities for both
halls.
The petition came after the
College failed to act following
complaints to the Housing
Committee and a letter of protest in
Felix 996.
The Rector's reply has been
described by one student as promis-
ing, but as yet no definite action has
been taken by the College.
Funding Cuts Attacked
BY MIKE INGRAM
The Government's higher education
funding policy came under fire
from employers this week.
A report released on Monday by
the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) warns the
Government that Â£3 billion must be
found to increase the number of
university places.
It says that the Government's
target of 33% of young people
going into higher education must be
raised to 40% if British business is
to compete with the rest of the
world. "Economic success depends
more than ever on the brainpower
and creativity of the workforce."
The report comes after a paper
published by the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) in May detailed a drop in
university funding (Felix 1001). It
said that funding per student has
been cut by 25% over the last four
years, and predicted a further
reduction of 14% during the next
three.
The CBI has criticised the
reduction: "It means higher
education is being rationed and -
though we appreciate the
Government's motives - in our
.view it is a mistake."
The report also suggested that
universities could sustain an annual
4% "efficiency gain" until the end
of the century.
This view is not shared by the
Chairman of the CVCP, Dr Kenneth
Edwards. Speaking to a CBI
conference on higher education on
Monday, he said: "it would create a
system with high dropout rates,
unable to give the individual
attention needed to ensure that
students develop not only agile and
creative minds, but also core skills
and a commitment to continuing
self-learning."
The Association of University
Teachers has controversially stated
its opposition to any further cuts:
"Unlike the CBI and the vice-
chancellors we are willing to say
publicly that the quality of the
learning experience available to our
students has suffered as a result of
under-resourced expansion.
It is time to drop the pretence
that it is possible to reduce funding
per student year after year without
any effect on the quality of
education they receive. The damage
that has been done to our universities
is a national scandal. It should be
the subject of an independent
review so that the true condition of
our universities can be properly
assessed before we embark on any
more cut-price expansion."
