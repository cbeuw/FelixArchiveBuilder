His
Lordship's
Fancy
The theatre, situated conveniently above a pub,
was small, cosy and a strange shade of pink. We
stepped out from the busy streets of the city into
the warm rural countryside of Italy and felt
immediately welcomed by the singing and
dancing cast. The stage was in the centre and
could be effectively viewed from both sides. The
audience sat amongst props (such as underwear
drying on washing lines). The atmosphere was
excellent right from the start.
The play, an English adaptation of an Italian
script, was set in the village of Montefosco. It
concerns the misfortune of the beautiful,
melodramatic Rosaura, who fights to claim the
estate which rightfully belongs to her. However,
she has no money to bring the case to court.
Enter Beatrice and the young Marchese, a
dominant mother and a feeble, womanising son
of noble status who believe the land is theirs.
Beatrice, realising the threat that Rosaura brings,
decides to marry her off to her son. Meanwhile,
the young Marchese is upsetting the male

villagers by sleeping with their wives and
daughters. Accompanied by a village committee,
three tarts and an alternative Manuel from
Fawlty Towers, the production was fun and
humorous with a hint of politics. All the cast
was superb apart from their peculiar Italian
accents and frequent spitting(!).
It was highly entertaining and well worth
watching.
