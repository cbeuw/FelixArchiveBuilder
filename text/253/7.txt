Hints on how to
INCREASE
COOKING
YOUR
POWER
Is it possible to prepare good wholesome meals in an economical
and speedy fashion ? To avoid using the can opener and the frying
pan and to eat food which doesn't taste of colouring,flavouringand
monosodium glutunate ?
The answer is a little flavour-
ing and careful buying. Wise
shopping is without doubt the
basis of good cooking. Buv things
which are cheap because thev are
plentiful and not because of poor
quality.
If you can't afford a steak buv
a fresh herring. Dip in flour and
fry gently in a little marg. or oil:
When cooked sprinkle with salt
and squeeze lots of fresh lemon
on it. Served with a crisp salad
and some brown bread it makes a
splendidly cheap meal.
Salads are a welcome addition
to almost any dish. You can have
them with grilled meat, with a
bought pie or with a cheesy dish.
Here are two recipes : one for
summer and the other which you
can prepare in the winter months.
Summer Salad
You will need:
One crisp lettuce
Tomatoes
Cucumber
Some chopped green pepper.
Wash and shake lettuce well.
Mix two tablespoons olive oil
with one of malt vinegar, add salt
and pepper. Whip all these in-
gredients with a kitchen fork
until mixture becomes a little
thick and is thoroughly emulsified.
Mix the roughly chopped lettuce
into your seasoning and toss
gently with a spoon or fork. Add
other vegetables on top.
Winter Salad
One small head chicory
One Cox's apple
One medium carrot
One hard boiled egg
Cook the egg for ten minutes.
Meanwhile wash and chop
chicory. Peel and grate (with a
coarse grater) carrot and apple,
chop egg.
Whip together (with a fork) one
tablespoon olive oil and one of
lemon juice. Add salt and pepper,
mix with chopped ingredients. A
little chopped raw celery goes well
with this mixture. This salad im-
proves if it is allowed to macerate
in its seasoning for about ten
minutes or so.
These salads can often replace
the vegetables which are more
elaborate to prepare—especially
the winter ones. The carrot (that
most underrated vegetable) is an
exception. Carrots are always
available and can be deliciously
cheap when cooked like this :
Peel and finely slice one pound
of carrots. Have some hot water
ready in the kettle. Put a table-
spoon of marg. or dripping into
a saucepan. When hot add car-
rots. Mix with a wooden spoon
until carrots are coated with fat
then add half a teaspoon of flour
and some salt; go on stirring for
a minute or so, then add enough
hot water to cover carrots. Cover
with a tight-fitting lid, turn down
the heat and cook till tender. You
might have to add some more hot
water during cooking time (about
half an hour) especially if the
carrots are aged ones.
Here is a recipe for good
tomato and meat sauce. Served
with rice, spaghetti or noodles
(and followed by one of my
salads it makes a complete meal.
For two : use—
One small onion
One tin peeled tomatoes
One ounce marg. or dripping
\\b good minced beef
One small green pepper
when available
Salt and pepper and a
teaspoon of sugar
Fry the onion gently in the
marg or dripping; do not allow
to brown. Add minced beef; allow
to cook for two or three minutes
while stirring with a wooden
spoon. Add chopped green pep-
per and tomatoes. Squash toma-
toes with your spoon ; add salt,
pepper and sugar. Add a little
hot water, cover and allow to
cook gently for half an hour. Add
some more hot water if sauce
becomes dry during cooking time.
A dash of inexpensive cooking
sherry (about a tablespoon) added
about half way through the cook-
ing time gives this sauce that
little " je ne xxu.t critoi." Serve
hot on your cooked spaghetti
with lots of finely grated cheese.
I am told that the best way to
decide whether the spaghetti is
properly cooked is to take a piece
and fling it onto the kitchen ceil-
ing. If it sticks it is well cooked
and ready to eat. I advise you to
avoid this method of testing as I
suspect that landladies strongly
disapprove of such culinary ex-
periments.
Here is a list of things to have
in your larder which are needed
for these recipes.
Bottle olive oil (Boots have a
good one in many sizes)
Malt vinegar
Italian peeled tomatoes
Margarine
Carrots (Keep well for a few
days)
Green peppers (Keep well for
a few days if they are good)
Cheddar cheese
The olive oil seems a little ex-
pensive but lasts a long time if
only used for salads. The other
kinds of oil are not really nice
enough to have with raw vege-
tables.
Bon appetit.
