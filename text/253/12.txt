Dear S i r ,
Due to health reasons I had to give up a l l my ENTS work only four days before RCS
carravala This could easily have resulted not only in a chaotic Carnival, but also to
large f i n a n c i a l loss to RCSU, The fact that i t did not was due to the very generous
oifer to take over by a few people. May I thank these people through your columns, as
l am indebted (as i s the Union as a whole) !*>' them* Mike Tait, A l l a n Wilde, Jan Laine,
and Dave Milf ord a l l pat i n a h e l l of a lot of work, making Carnival a b i g success. I
cannot convey my appreciation enough to these four i n particular, and the many others,
who helped me out when I was i n trouble,
lours f a i t h f u l l y

m e t i n g of the ICU council was held i n the reading room on Monday
evening. As a study i n boredom i t would be hard to surpass - there wasn't even a decent
staff,' The meeting f u l l y attended with the exception of the three old student reps.
_ The reports of sub-.cornrtdttees were discussed and passed with l i t t l e comment except
i n the case of the RCC report; Council directed the executive to look into the affairs
of Jazz club, with particular reference to stomps and other dances.
Under "AOB" there were two items of interest. F i r s t l y Steve Mallinson proposed
that a subcommittee of f i v e council members be set up to investigate ways to make the
External Affairs and Welfare oomrrdttees o f f i c i a l sub-committees of council and to suggest
methods of evolving their chairman and n embers. This motion was passed unanimously.
Rex Lowin then proposed that those members of council who on sub-committees were
ICU reps on college committees ex~officio should i n future be elected by joint c o u n c i l .
This motion got t o t a l l y lost i n Ruhenacratic bickering about a r t i c l e n of the
constitution and was f i n a l l y defeated,

LORD TENNYSON'S GRANDSON.
S i r Charles Tennyson, spoke at Tuesday's general studies lecture; "A biographical

This interest was gained by reading books i n his father1

i n poetry also dated from an early age but none of his early volumes were successful.
He went to Cambridge but l e f t without taking a degree. Several scientists including

On Monday evening a joint meeting of the S o c i a l i s t s and Communist Societies heard
a tljlk by George Matthews, Editor of the "Morning Star" about the l e f t wing press. A
Parliamentary Laboufc Party Candidate, George dealt with the problems of the press.
He f e l t the "Morning Star" not only acted as a place where s o c i a l i s t s from the l e f t
of the Labour Party, Ccrammists and other minorities, students for example could state
their views but i t s mere exLstance forced the Press Barons to publish news they -would
.otherwise leave unreported. He advocated a newsprint levy fund as a possible way to
prevent the closure of even more national and provincial newspapers.
