Creat I.C. Cup Win
Last Saturday I.C. scored a magnificent cup victory over King's
College by three goals to nil. This was thefirstI.C. win over King's
for five years and it's true merit is shown by the fact that King's are
unbeaten in league matches this season.
I.C. began unsteadily, gradually took control andfinallyoveran
the opposition. The game was won in midfield where Wallace, making
full use of the space given him, created panic in the King's defence
with telling passes. After 20 minutes, Keer's centre from the left was
cleared to Squire, who calmly lobbed it over the goalkeeper only to see
it palmed away by a defender. Wallace made no mistake from the
spot.
The second half continued with the I.C. defence winning every
loose ball, their efforts being soon rewarded when in a move involving
six players, Keer beat three men before crossing for O'Donnell to slot
the ball home. i
The third goal followed when Squire intercepted a loose clearance
and sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from just inside the area.
This was a memorable victory based on good teamwork and spirit
and a similar performance in the next round should see I.C. in the
semi-final.

The club on a whole this term
has not been winning many
matches, but on the other hand
neither has it suffered the re-
sounding crashes it has endured
in previous years.
The 2nd XI is showing tre-
mendous promise, the side settled
down quickly and despite the
usual changeover in players due
to movements in the 1st XI and
mavoidable absenteeism. The side
has won 3, lost 3 and drawn 1
and if the improvements in team
play especially by the forwards
continue, the side can look for-
ward to better results in the
future.
The 3rd and 4th XI's are even
more strongly hit by the move-
ments of players in the ist and
2nd XFs and they have both
managed to produce records
better than those for this
time last year. So the 3rd
XI can look forward to a bright
future and if there is the demand
by members of the club for the
4th XI to continue in the next
term, they too can look forward
to a good season.
The 2nd XI in their cup match
overwhelmed King's 4th XI as
was expected by a margin of 7-1,
Brian Hall got three goals to add
to the incredible number he is
building up this season for his po-
sition as wing half.

On December 2nd, the ladies of
ICWA played at New Cross
against Goldsmith's in the 2nd
round of the U.L.U. Knock-out
Tournament. ICWA opened the
scoring with a good goal, but
Goldsmith's rapidly retaliated
with an equally good one. Two
more goals came in quick suc-
cession, and the half-time score
stood at 2 all. At the beginning of
the second half, an immediate
breakaway by Goldsmith's from
the bully resulted in a goal, giv-
ing them the lead. Although IC
attacked consistently throughout
the second half, they were not
rewarded with a goal until two
minutes before the end of the
game, ft being too dark to play
extra time, it was decided to have
a replay the following Wednes-
day.
Goldsmith's duly arrived at
Harlington on Wednesday, 6th
December and battle commenced
again. The match was very even,
with many attacks by both sides,
and excellent work by both defen-
ces. The half-time score was 1
all, and although both sides
fought keenly, no addition was
made to the score. Only 10 mins.
of extra time could be played
because of failing light and it was
decided to count corners. Lo and
behold, both sides had scored 2
short corners and 1 long.
The re-replay will be held on
Wednesday, 17th January at
Goldsmith's and lots of support
would be appreciated, so that we
get a conclusive result.
NETBALL
I.C. 15 — Chelsea 12
The match started late with
I.C. understrength in the attack
without their regular goal shooter.
I.C. was playing the better game
tactically from the first centre-
pass; marking fairly well, and
passing tightly, and in spite of
praiseworthy efforts by the
shooters, the half-time score was
6-5 to Chelsea.
The second half saw some close
marking and faster play by I.C.
The superbly co-ordinated de-
fence kept play within Chelsea's
half, enabling I.C. to gain a lead
which they then never lost.
Thanks are given to Weeks
Hall for their support.

spread the IC runners held their
positions well and finished 2, 4,
10, 14, 16 and 18.

ceedingly well and finished
fourth, the highest a second team
has ranked for many years.
The winning team were (Barry
Jones. Nick Barton, Howard
Smith, Ashley Deans, Tony
Mason and Ian Jones).
Squash
The Club as a whole is doing
very well in its competition
matches and the strength of the
second and thirds is very grati-
fying.
The League results so far are :
The Firsts have won four out
of eight (4/ 8) and with the recent
addition of a decent No. 1 player,
Dr. Collin Wall (Staff, Mines)
they are in a much better position
to make a comeback in the second
round.
The Seconds are leading their
Division handsomely with 8/8
wins and one match to go in their
first round.
The Thirds are very near the
top of Division III with 3 /4 wins,
while the Fourths (Ladies) in the
same Division have won 1/4.
Though they have fewer successes
on the court, it seemes that the
Fourths enjoy the matches as
much ,if not more, than the rest
of us.
During November, IC compo-
site " A " and " B " teams went
to Cambridge for a weekend of
squash against College teams.
The " A " team lost to Christs,
St. Catherine's and Queens, while
the " B " team defeated Corpus
Christi and Pembroke but lost to
St. John's.
The Firsts upheld their position
in the Challenge Match of the IC
Seconds, much to the relief of the
IC Squash Establishment.
