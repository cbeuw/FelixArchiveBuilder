FOOD
SURVEY
To find out just how satisfied in general students are with
"Mooney," on Friday, 1st December, at lunchtime, FELIX carried
out an elementary sample census. In each refectory about 50 people
were asked the following three questions:
1. Do you enjoy a Mooney meal!

Dirty Cutlery and Excessive Queues?
A surprisingly large number of people were, in fact, satisfied
with the food and the price but it must be remembered that this is
an analysis of people who are using the facilities. Interviewees were
also asked for any brief comments. By far the most common com-
plaint was about the excessive queues, although one FELIX reporter
did comment that people were being served quicker than he could
interview them. A lot of people said the cutlery was dirty. Surprising
is the difference in the numbers of people in the two snack bars who
enjoyed their meal. The figure for the number of people who only
sometimes enjoy the food in S.S. snack bar is high; surely the quality
and variety is constant in the snack bars. A few people in both South-
side refectories commented that the food ran out long before refec-
tories close and that in both these places, it is not possible to get tea.
One person claimed that in the snack bars, ham sandwiches cost more
than from British Rail. Many people indicated that the choice of
food was too restricted.
There was one isolated comment of praise; the remainder were
complaints, and most were not trivial. Among the constructive criti-
cism was a common complaint that there are no eating facilities
available other than during limited hours and a suggestion that a snack
bar should be open during daytime and evenings was made by several
people.
Who is Mooney ?
A number ot people had never heard of Mooney—dare I suggest
that these were not from college, or is it possible for a fresher to have
existed a term without having come across this expression?
One person complained of being disturbed by FELIX reporters
and another said Mooney more than twice a week upset his stomach.
One person seriously refused to answer the three questions.
MOONEY TELLS
A L L
Mr. Victor Mooney has been I.C.'s catering manager since he
took up the job at the age of 30—" for my sins." This truly Hercu-
lean task was the culmination of a long post-war career in hotels and
kitchens up and down Britain. During the war he served in the Navy.
He still sails for pleasure in his spare time ; a large navigational map
of the Solent hangs in his office. He answered the varied criticisms
of his catering, put to him by FELIX, with a direct and keen desire
to get the facts straight
"Cutlery is too dirty **...**do you call this lamb's muscle or
lamb's chop?" . . . " can we have more variety, please?" . . . " When
did the last Mooney meal disappear down the last Mooney gullet?"
. . . these are just a few quotes from the gastronomic graffiti of the
refectories complaint book.
Mr. Mooney answered the main serious criticisms point by point
beginning with complaints about slow queues. Part of the reason for
this, is that new students take some time to settle down to the
system and hence slow up the queues in the winter term. A lot of
time is wasted by people hesitating when faced with a choice between
one succulent dish and another. The situation is not improved by the
fact that most people come for these meals during the peak periods.
Two cashiers per exit had been tried in most overloaded refectories
to cope with this, but was not found to be really effective.
Next — dirty cudery? Mr. what appears to be dirt on cutlery
in fact commented that Mooney
food is far superior to that pro-
duced by refectories at such
places as Manchester University,
Warwick University (" atrocious
. . . abominable"), and University
College. If a meal seems particu-
larly bad, it can always be ex-
changed. Mr. Mooney did how-
ever promise to look into com-
plaints of dry carrots and poor
chips. He also felt that complaints
of little variety were not really
justified. If people come along
just as refectories are closing,
obviously there will be little
choice; but in general all the items
advertised on the menu (and
there are quite a few) will be
available.
Mr. Mooney admitted that the
salmonella scare which hit Man-
chester University earlier this
term—fifty people were taken ill
with food poisoning—worried
him, as it must any large catering
establishment. There is always
a risk of infection, and it is al-
most impossible to remove it in
large hard-worked kitchens.
On the matter of increase of
prices ,it seems that this was
planned to net a surplus of
£13,000 this session. Whether
this will in fact come to pass is
" in the lap of the gods "—and
perhaps also, the Exchequer.
Since the refectory calculations
were first mooted, the' price of
meat, for example, has risen by
some 10 per cent, due to devalua-
tion. The refectories are sup-
posed to break even in the long
run, but if this cost escalation
continues then prices may have
to rise again to cope. As the
FELIX survey confirms, most of
I.C. considers Moaney meats to
be value for money—at present.
The Chip
Problem
Mooney is concerned about this
complaint and is thinking of
changing dish-washers to improve
the situation. One of the chief
problems, however, is that the
water in the London area is
"hard." Because of this, much of
is in fact deposited scale.
The food is badly cooked? " I
don't accept that," said Mr.
Mooney, " We are continually
being complimented on the stan-
dard of our food by external
customers." Several people have
A final word on tne vexed
question of the Mooney chip.
" Chips are very difficult to do,'*"
said Mr. Mooney. " Even Lyons
haven't really cracked the prob-
lem yet. . . " And, oh boy, what
a problem!
EIGHT TONS

F SPUDS
IC is noted as a college keen
on the facts and figures of the
situation. Herewith some of the
more interesting details concern-
ing Mooney's emporia: —
In just one day the refectories
use:
200 lbs. of peas
100 lbs. of b^ans
100 lbs. of carrots
200 lbs. of cabbage.
When meat pie is on the menu
in Southside lower refectory,
150 lbs. of mincemeat are used
at one sitting.
Eight tons of potatoes are
needed each week, making a total
of about 280 tons used in a ses-
sion. Most of these potatoes are
converted into the notorious
" Mooney chips." If all these
chips, eaten each year, were laid
end to end, they would stretch a
distance of about 700 miles, i.e.
6,000 times round Southside, or
from here to Gretna Green and
back again. To those statisticians
accustonied to Pan Am passenger
seat miles stretching forty times
round the earth, this is pretty
small potatoes (ouch!), but it
nevertheless represents a lot of
eating.
The kitchens possess five dish-
washers, three in Southside and
two in the Union. Between them
they consume £780 of detergent a
year.
1,600 people eat in IC refec-
tories at lunchtime. Of these
about 600 go to Southside's lower
refectory; most of these go within
the peak half-hour.
The total turnover of IC refec-
tories (this does not include Bar
and Cellar figures) was £177,553.
The net takings were only
£170,852. As the refectories are
planned to break even, this is the
reason for the increase in meal
prices. Catering purchases total
£111,152, the bulk going on food
•—2nd a sum of money that big
buys an awful lot of food. It's
not mentioned exactly how much
was spent on replacing stolen
cutlery.
The surplus for the b#rs last
year was a mere £72. The Rugby
Club must try harder.
