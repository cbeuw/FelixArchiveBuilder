CARNIVAL SUCCESS
Once again Carnivals showed that they are the best value in the
Lr.ion calendar. Where else for M)/- double can you get The Action,
Savoy Brown Blues Band, 1984, Cat Ballou, The People, 2 meals (?),
coffee, punch, folk, jazz ?
But to get to specifics : The Action were not at their best in the
first session but were much improved in the second; The Savoy
Brown's were good without being outstanding, 1984 were, well, 1984.
A stroke of genius put the film in the lower refectory permanently
and had three showings, thus avoiding disruption caused by furniture
moving and the big squeeze at one showing. The choice of film—
" Cat Ballou "—was an excellent one, satisfying both those who had
seen it before and those who had not.
Cabaret
The cabaret was good in places,
embarrassing for some in others.
This was the first time a com-
pletely professional cabaret had
been used at an RCS Carnival for
some years, and by comparison
with last year's was well worth
the expense. Entitled " The
People Show " it consisted of a
series of sometimes hilarious
sometimes disturbing sketches in-
volving three men and a woman
on the theme of motherhood, de-
flating some of the more fatuous
interjectors on the way.
Surprise Guest
An unpublicised performer
was Gary Farr, who, since leav-
ing the T-Bones, has been song-
writing and folk singing. He
sang for about twenty minutes
Coffee was continuously avail-
able in the upper refectory, and
folk and jazz on tap in the Senior
Common Room. The only
trouble with the potent punch was
that it ran out before most people
even knew of its existence.
Food Fiasco
The one real criticism which
can be levelled against it—and
that is hardly the fault of RCS
Ents—was the food. After one
had stood and been pushed
around by the animals waiting for
their feed, whilst numerous fed
specimens squeezed themselves
through the hungry masses,
The Carnival only made a
small loss of about £30, due
mainly to RCS Ents Chairman.
" Spooks" Duckett's economy
measures.
But let us not carp on this
point; it was truly a Carnival
which lived up to Carnival ex-
pectations.

D YOU
A BOUTIQUE?
Admittedly the electronics industry isn't every
graduate's cup of tea, but for the able, intellectu-
ally curious, technically minded, and reasonably
income conscious, it is a possibility that is well
worth looking into.
STC is one of the largest British industrial
employers of graduates. We take oh well over 100
new graduates each year—mainly electrical
engineers, mechanical and production engineers,
physicists and other scientists, but including a few
Arts people as well.
We think we have a lot to offer—interesting
problems, well equipped labs, large scale but
decentralised management, early responsibility,
international associates, high Investment in re-
search, a lively atmosphere.
And we pay rather well.
We will be visiting your University on January
19, 22,1968. In the meantime our booklet 'Informa-
tion for Graduates' is available from University
Appointments Boards, or directly from:

MONSTER
Mr. Dinsdale, an aeronautical
engineer who has made an ex-
tensive study of the Loch Ness
monster phenomenon, gave a
convincing and well illustrated
talk to Wells Soc. on Monday,
4th December.
He, himself, has seen a monster
and is quite convinced of the
existence of a colony of these
giant beasts in Loch Ness. From
the material he has collected the
average monster appears to be
40 ft in length with a reptillian
head, a serpentine neck 8 ft long,
a massive body and a long tail
presumably used for steering—•
whether they have flippers or feet
has not been established. This
description would seem to fit a
descendant of the Pleiseosaur, a
theory which Mr. Dinsdale per-
sonally supports, but other sug-
gestions include an invertebrate
like a giant slug.
Mr. Dinsdale showed the evi-
dence to le» the audience decide
for themselves. This included still
photographs from various sources,
most of which were very hazy
and dubious, filmed interviews
with eye witnesses and Mr. Dins-
dale s own cine shot of a monster
swimming out across the iocb
leaving a nugh " V " wake.
Mr. Dinsdale is a founder
member of the " Loch Ness Phe-
nomena Investigation Bureau"
which is now supported by funds
from the States. " Monster Spot-
ting " holidays under the auspices
of tbis society can be enjoyed by
anyone for the very reasonable
charge of £7 10s. Od. per fort-

Last Thursday's Union debate,
"that this house would join the
brain drain," provided lunchtime
entertainment for the large audi-
ence, but one would have ex-
pected a much more serious and
useful discussion in Imperial Col-
lege. There was much fine
rhetoric but little else.
R e s t r a i n e d
A t t a c l c s
Professor Anderson, of the
Electrical Engineering depart-
ment, in proposing the motion,
made the usual points about the
grass being greener on the Other
side, and then gave a case his-
tory (from his own experience)
of lost opportunities, in thin film
transistors. Dr. Jeremy Bray,
MP, began with remarks about
viable and sensible microelec-
tronic projects and then went on
to give afineWilsonite speech to
the effect that British industry
needs reorganising into larger
units and that this was being
done, but takes a little time. One
felt that Professor Anderson
could have been a lot more
damning of the Ministry of Tech-
nology and that, in turn, he was
lucky to get off so lightly at the
hands of a professional politician.
G r e e n P a i n t
In seconding- the motion,
David Robert, a PG from Aus-
tralia, seemed mainly concerned
with pointing out the advan-
tages of Australia. Malcolm
Duckett's main contribution to
the opposition was that the grass
was only painted -green on the
other side.
The voting was 93 for emigra-
tion and 42 against. The debate
was academic in more sense than
one, however, as only that morn-
ing we had heard news of the
drastic new American immigra-
tion law.
LITSOC
FAIRIES
The Literary Society held its
third meeting of the term in the
reading room of the Union build-
ing last Monday, December 4th.
on " Fairytales, Legends and
Myths." The speakers were five
I.C. fairies; Mike Edwards, Maia
Wallis (
"

h
o popped in from
Icwaland and then tropoed out to
sing jazzl. Mike Mansfield, J. P.
Connerade and Chris Eriksson.
Mike Edwards opened the dis-
cussion with the Arthusian le-
gend. He recalled the excellent
reason for the existence of King
Arthur and the Round Table, the
committing of chivalrous acts,
such as rescuing fair maidens in
distress. (Tcwarians are not recom-
mended to wave handkerchieyes
out of Beit Hall windows as
M.R.E. is develonme chivalrous
characteristics). Perhaps omi-
nously, he told the society that
King Arthur will come again,
according to legend.
Maria Wallis introduced the
society to the Greek horses, who
supported both sides in a battle
(after all they had not T.V. then),
and who came down to earth when
they felt like pleasure. She told us
that the Greeks separated their
religion from their mythology.
Perhaps that is something else
our science-worshipping society
can learn from the Greeks.
Mansfield Lord
Gnome ?
The discussion continued with
a convincing Mike Mansfield tel-
ling, the society of the life with
elves and gnomes behind leaves.
The meeting was also informed
that fairies are not people but the
place where fairies live; (can we
be assured that this important
piece of information will be
passed on to the Rector for aca-
demic dissemination, and to the
students at the next Union meet-
ing?) He endad by informing the
meeting that fJIMPCS were not
really nasty people since they al-
ways come to the rescue in the
end!
Speaking next was Chris Erik-
son on Old English and Norse
Gods. He passionately recalled
the English and Scandinavian
Gods of war, Thor, Frig, Balder
etc, and the story of the Bleeding
God. The society was informed
from the Niblungenlied of King
Gunther was beaten up by
his disinterested wife Brunhilde
on the wedding night and sus-
pended by his pyjamas on a wall
nail; (anybody with a similar ex-
perience please see Doc. Grey).
Sadism
The discussion ended with J. P.
Connerade, in typically excellent
form, recalling Grilles de Paris'
adventures with sadism in his
castles, and how this developed
into the myth of Bluebeard.
Discounting the absence of
Hans Christian Anderson and the
Arabian Nights, the meeting
proved successful.

This article will be of great
interest to those who find diffi-
culty in getting down to work.
The Southside Halls' lifts are
noted for their tendency to oscil-
late when the passengers jump
around inside. In addition they
are liable to stop and not restart
if this exercise is overdone.
About a week ago, two resi-
dents of Tizard Hall discovered
this phenomenon and decided that
the lift was the ideal place for
doing problem sheets. They made
one mistake: they rang the alarm
bell and were rescued wihin half
an hour.
This method of " getting away
from it all" is still in the early
stages of development. Next time,
they intend to take along thermos
flasks and borrow some hall
cushions. The legal aspect of
this exercise is not clear. Does
being stuck all night in a lift with
a non-resident constitute intro-
ducing an overnight guest?
