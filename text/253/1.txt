A.Sc.W. Parking Row
At a recent General Meeting of the College Branch of the
Association of Scientific Workers, the technicians union, it was
decided that individual members should write to the Chairman of the
Board of Governors, Lord Sherfield, to request the opening of nego-
tiations on parking, between the college and the A.Sc.W. The union
believes that the college's parking proposals have not been properly
thought out and that they have a scheme which is fairer, more
practical and less costly to operate. They are determined that the
college plan shall not go through and intend to use all possible means
at their disposal to stop it.
An A.Sc.W. agreement with IC outlines procedures for neg6tia-
tions on terms and conditions of service—but the Rector, Lord
Penney, does not consider this covers amenity questions, such as
parking, and has refused to negotiate separately with any section of
the college.
Last vear the Parkin" Commit-

should be no charee for narkine
places and that a central com-
mittee should allocate places on
the basis of greatest need, re-
gardless of whether the applicant
was staff, student or technician
and regardless of which depart-
ment he belonged to. Sir Own
Saunders, who was then acting
Rector asked the parking com-
mittee to reconsider his recom-
mendation for an annual £5 park-
ing charge and they threw it out
again. Perhaps it is significant
that the student and A.Sc.W.
members, representing nearly
4,000 people, were particularly
against a parking fee. When Lord
Penney took up office as Rector
this term he reconstituted the
parking committee, pushing
through plans for departmental
allocation of parking spaces and
the £5 charge.
Superior plan
Mr. Harrv Fairbrother. branch
secretary of the A.Sc.W. and a
tectum in the Maths department,
and Mr. Sic-s. A.c
c.W.. repre-
sentative on the parking commit-
tee, are understandably annoyed
at this undemocratic action, and
intend tofightit to the end. They
are particularly incensed that the
charge does not cover the cost of
providing parking places but will
go towards other amenities, and
are taking legal advice on whether
the college charter permits such
charges to be made for amenities.
The provision of the Prices and
Incomes Bill—invoked frequently
by the college during negotiations
on wages and holidays—are also
being studied. Other universities
throughout the country—includ-
ing Aberdeen, Essex and South-
ampton—are said to be introduc-
ing charges for parking, and Go-
vernment pressure is suspected.
Mr. Fairbrother, who was a
member of the A.Sc.W. Traffic
Committee, has vast experience
in the field of parking control and
traffic flow and is confident that
the A.Sc.W. parking scheme,
which includes plans for a one-
way traffic flow around the Col-
lege Block area, is superior to the
official college plan and has few,
if any, faults. His union is also,
working on a scheme for time-
controlled parking which should
increase the effective number of
parking spaces by 20 per cent.
In an exchange of letters with
the Rector, Mr. Fairbrother has
outlined his plans and pressed for
serious consideration of them, but
so far to no avail.
" paris-in "
In actual fact, the difficult
over provision of parking spac
should never have arisen, as GLX
planning regulations require on
car space to be provided for ever
2,000 square feet floor space c
new office block. In the case c
the new college block, this wuulc
have meant that 900 space;
should have been available to
car owners in the college, and a
there are only about 850 car users
the problem would have been
solved for many years to come.
However, Mr. Fairbrother has
ascertained that, under pressure
from the UGC, the college asked
for, and was granted, exemption
from this requirement. As a
result, only 400 spaces are avail-
able, a number totally inadequate
for a college of this size, and when
the Architectural Association
come to IC the problem will get
worse rather than better.
In view of the A.Sc.W.'s wide
knowledge of parking problems,
through their traffic committee,
it seems odd that greater atten-
tion has not been paid to their
proposals. The main body of
A.Sc.W. members willfightthem
all the way with a number of
measures they have worked out,
culminating, in the very last re-
sort, with a mass descent on the
parking spaces, which they will
occupy, more or less permanently
without paying. The A.Sc.W.
have heard that the college has
taken legal advice and found out
that if cars occupy parking space
without permission or without
paying, they are powerless to
move them. This may well be
wishful thinking, but the techni-
cians are willing to risk it.
As a footnote, it is interesting
to examine the real reason for
having parkina meters in South
Ken. If the proposed computer-
controlled traffic scheme border-
ing the area breaks down and
traffic jams result, it is necessary
to have some roads available on
a Fail-safe basis for dispersing
these holduos. Queenseate and
Exhibition Road are two of these
and the parkins meters are heinc
introduced to clear them rea^v
for the eventuality of a break-
down!

Selkirk Search
The Warden of Selkirk Hall, Mr. Seaford, has at last carried out
his threatened early Sunday morning " cushion hunting " raid on the
Hall residents.
On Saturday 2nd December there was a party on a landing in
Selkirk Hall. At about 1.00 a.m. while it was still going strong Mr.
Seaford came down and warned those present that he would have a
"cushion hunting" expedition early the following morning having
previously warned residents that he would inspect rooms without
warning if cushions continued to disappear. Two of the residents
were, according to eye witness accounts, so intoxicated as to be not
responsible for their actions—and two girls stayed the remainder of
the night in their rooms.
tour de farce
At 6.20 a.m. Mr. Seatord woke George Assimakis, Secretary of
Selkirk Hall Committee, requesting him to accompany him on an
inspection of residents' rooms, searching for the missing cushions.
Surprisingly enough, no cushions were found. However, the two girls
were; although in one case the couple were fully dressed.
Committee over-ruled
At a Hall Committee meeting
on the following evening it was
suggested by the residents that the
two boys should be barred from
Hall tiH the end of term and for the
vacation andfined£5. Mr. .Sea-
ford overruled them and said that
the boys could remain in Hall till
the end of term, but would not
be allowed Hall residence after
that for the rest of the session.
They would of course be con-
sidered on equal terms with other
applicants for next session.
They had a chance of appeal to
the Secretary of Halls of Resi-
dence Committee who happens to
be the Domestic Bursar, Mr.
Seaford.
Once the discovery had been
made, Mr. Seaford seems to have
acted in the oYily way possible.
He has, in fact, done more than
he need, for he had made sure
that the two residents have ac-
ceptable accommodation for next
term.
Tizard Beware
Dr. Cameron, Tizard Hall
Warden, has now said that he too
may make cushion hunting expe-
ditions, but would give residents
three days notice.
Guilds
at
Play
Tuesday's meeting of C&G
uirriii members opened late as
tradition c'eminds. There were
the usual proftit ion of paper
darts nvi shouts of Up, Up, but
no Selkirk cushions. After the
unptessaittnes; of the minutes of
the previous meeting and Morphy
Bav had been read, the treasurer
proudly claimed that C&G had
m: tic a substantial loss during
the previous year, mainly due to
the president's large capacity !
Then followed the election of
the ICWA rep. All candidates
were proposed by Dermott Corr
in order to dispel doubts about
his sexual leaning. In the ensu-
ing riot Randy Niandy's hair
tipped the balance against
Mysza's figure and she was intro-
duced to her duties during the
.nsuing darkness. When the
victorious Morphy and Lowry
boat crews had been awarded
their colours, Dick James an-
nounced that the carnival collec-
tion had totalled more than RCS
& RSM's together and added that
anyone who had not heard his
voice should join the carol sing-
ing party on Friday. Chris
ODonncii followed this up by
pointing out that the unplanned
series of non-events for non-
enjoyment had betn a complete
success, particularly since IC is
now banned from all London
swimming baths.
There then followed three ex-
O uonnell Drunken Drama group.
The first portrayed a controver-
sial ogre being seasick over his
spiral beanstalk through over in-
dulging in gin. The foulmouth
claimed it was his first bite for
weeks, but those who peep
through key'oles find tis'ard to
believe. The second was way
above most people's heads and
the third; a trial of two " span-
ner " bearers accused of losing
their tool was beautifully obscene.
They were aauitted much to the
surprise of all present especially
the " Ioveable" vice-president,
whose self-incriminating evidence
during the trial resulted in his
hair being rather forcibly curled
by the new ICWA rep. and her
assistant.
Mooney reported
to W.C.
On Monday morning, 3rd year
Physicist, Dave Bowater, and
Union refectory complaints officer
Roy Allen w it to st*. Mr
Mooney, the lefectory manager,
to get an explanation of why
there was on one of the spoons
a mould-like substance. Mr.
Mooney said that this was nickel-
oxide and was caused by con-
tinued contact with mayonnaise.
He said he did not know how the
spoon had escaped the normal
burnishing process and that the
whole system of cutlery was being
improved.
Dave Bowater, who said that if
he had not received satisfaction
from Mr. Mooney he would have
taken the spoon to the Westmiri
ster City Council public health
department, his since found a
fork in similar condition.
