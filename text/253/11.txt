IMPERIAL COLLEGE SURVEYS ITS PAST STUDENTS
The feedback of comment from past students of I.C. forms a significant contribution
to reviewof academic courses and standards, so the college i s circulating a questionnaire
to past undergrads and postgrads of the years 1925-62+-.
The survey embraces B r i t i s h students wherever they now l i v e and Overseas students
s t i l l i n the country, but despite extensive checks on addresses, the college has 'lost1
many students and these are invited to contact Professor E.M. Goodger i n E l e c t r i o a l
Engineeriug. (Tel. 01-539-5111 Ext.465). The college hopes f o r a good response, as this
determines the whole value of the operation, and also hopes that the preliminary report
w i l l appear by Summer I968.

COST OF PURPLE REDUCED
I t appears that by means of an a l l night f i l t e r i n g operation, the b i l l f o r throwing
potassium permanganate into the Marshall Street swimming baths before the swimming gala
was only £6 - this i s a great r e l i e f as i f the pool had had to be emptied and cleaned the
cost to ICU would have been i n excess of £80, I t has not yet been discovered who
actually threw the chemical into the pool,
UNION MEETING-
Yesterday's Union Meeting v/a3 a classic f o r those connoisseurs of constitution
juggling and general s t i r r i n g .
The last Union Meeting of October 19th was re-opened, obviously short of a quorum
by about 100. After various people had been persuaded not to challenge the quorum Dr.
Weale, the Union Senior Treasurer, presented that accounts f o r the previous year and
explained the items on i t lucidly. The most important points were that expenditure had
risen by £1,600 to £18,264 whilst income had f a l l e n , although subscriptions were up by
£750. There was a negative balance of £2,497 on the year. After s e l l i n g nearly £1,700
worth of investments there was a nett d e f i c i t of £1,100, which i t i s hoped w i l l be
refunded by the college, which has given the Union 17/6 per head. He finished with his
perennial excuse that the Union fee was not b i g enough.
In 'Any Other Buisness1
President P h i l l i p s informed the meeting of a collection f o r
Charlie Parsons, to buy a plaque i n the Union Dining H a l l , the remainder to be given to
his widow, and Howard Cheshire, head Union barman f o r many years, for a g i f t ; reportsof
SCG, RCC, AGO and Executive minutes are to be published i n Southside and i n the Union;
and he i s negotiating a fee with the college f o r Union membership f o r 'disguised students*
who are registered as i n t e r a l students of London University but are not e l i g i b l e to belong
to the Union at present.
In Question Time the rumour that no foreign students w i l l be allowed i n Linstead
Hall was dispelled. The anonymous donor stipulated that no more than 20$ overseas
students should live i n i t , compared with a 'norm' at the present time of 15$•
Rory Redmayne asked why no agenda was posted, to which Dave Harris replied that i t ;
was an experiment to t r y to attract more people, despite the fact that i t stipulates
that i t should be done i n the Union Blue Book,
Rex Lowin gave an account of the a c t i v i t i e s of the Welfare Committee, The grants
survey so f a r lias a 66$ reply from undergraduates and 25$ from postgraduates. The results
should be out at the beginning of nextterm. They are also looking into the p o s s i b i l i t y
of opening a nursery f o r married students with children and he asked f o r names of anyone
who would be able to use the service, particularly undergraduates, to contact him, A
coffee bar i n Southside, a West London Colleges accommodation bureau, student houses and
appeals to the Rents Tribunal are the other matters being looked into by this Committee.
The f i r s t meeting was now closed and another one opened amongst a l o t of argument
and passed straight onto the issue of parking.
Two motions were put forward, one deploring the charge f01* parking and asking f o r
a referendum throughout the college, the other deploring the charges, the Rectorfc*
decision to reconstitute the parking committee and the: method of selection of those
allowed to park. Rory Redmayne, r e t i r i n g editor of FELIX opposed both of these, but
before votes could be taken Stewart Barnes t r i e d to put everyone out of their misery by
challenging the quorum; the number of people present by this time had f a l l e n to about
eighty. However, this was a'vain hope since i t was decided to vote on the motions as an
u n o f f i c i a l group of students,. Both were passed, the second i n separate parts.
