Well, despite suggestions from
Mr. ICWA, the " why just go for
girls, why not go for blokes ?"
the general committee has deniea*
it is feasible to have a girl open
day and has set up yet another
committee to handle it. That's
two this term (there's one looking
into the constitution), we should
manage at least halt a dozen when
we get going.
Jez
I'm sure everyone will be
pleased to know that Jez has been
saved. The plans for the " Save
Jez Fund" have been abandoned.
A surprise windfall in the form
of a £50 donation from the
printers of the RCS Handbook.
It seems they had this spare after
they'd collected the advertising
money, and decided their con-
science would be easier if they
gave it to us. Nice of them—
we just had to promise to use
them for the next three years.
Sexmania
It seems that some RCS girls
have got the wrong idea about
Bob's invitation to anyone to go
and discuss things with him. He's
not complaining but I think he
finds it a little wearying.
On the subject of Bob's women
he assures me that he is not en-
gaged to Betty, but don't get too
hopeful, girls, he still claims her
as his only true love. For those
who don't know, Betty hibernates
at Sheffield University, so you
probably won't have seen her.
More Gossip
It seems that the RCS Union
Officers are quite a romantic lot.
With Hon. Sec. Rog Webb en-
gaged to Asst. Hon. Sec. Linda,
Ents. Chairman Spooks engaged
to Viv and Pete Hall, Chairman
of Clubs and Mr. ICWA, in the
role of Don Quixote. But all
things considered Linda must
take the credit since Rog Webb,
IC Rep. Stew Barnes and Physics
Department Rep. Pete Dolwin all
claim to know a girl by that name.
Mackman defended
Guilds seem to be getting afraid
of our personable president. Andy
Jordan a Guildsman and founder
member of the Pooh Club has
started a " Deflate Mackman"
campaign. When will they learn
they can't get a good man down?
Anyway as the term draws to
a close on behalf of tbe Exec.
I'd like to thank all those who
have helped organise or simply
supported RCS efforts. Whether
it's by Morphy Day, R.C.S. Car-
nival, street collections, or carol
singing.
IC Words
O n omen
So much has been said lately about enticing women to IC that I
thought I would have my say. Open days for girls schools will be very
ineffective and will probably only encourage a few who are impressed
by the engineering and Physics buildings; show them the Chemistry
buildings and they'd run a mile. They never were very auspicious
and now in their half demolished state even less so. (The demolition
is however great entertainment as a change from lectures). The
Maths building is not much better—it gives one the impression that
it was built around a lift shaft.
Arts Bias
The heart of the trouble lies in
the courses given in science in
school and the attitude of school
staff to science. In girls Gram-
mar Schools and others the policy
is pro-arts and science ta"kes
second place. Many headmistres-
ses consider scientists ignorant
and uninformed. Many who do
recognise scientists as intelligent
girls persuade them not to come
to IC as this will "narrow " them,
being completely scientific. They
must be told IC broadens any
girl's mind of necessity. Even
if these visits persuade girls to
apply to fC how many will be
able to fulfil the requirements?
With bias against science in girls
schools the teaching will be much
better on the arts side. After all
a good arts graduate hasn't a lot
of choice as to a job but a good
science graduate has a great
choice most of which are more
rewarding financially.
More trouble
It is difficult to say how we
can get more girls to come to IC,
but I am sure that open days for
girls schools will be more trouble
than they are worth.
ICWA's Old Folk
Last Wednesday, ICWA held
its annual Old Folks tea party.
Unfortunately only nine were able
to come of a possible thirty who
were visited. However the party
was a great success and was
thoroughly enjoyed by old folk
and Icwarians alike. The guests
were served tea the cakes for
which had been made by Icwar-
ians in Mooney's kitchen the pre-
vious day. After tea carols were
sung, led by members of the
choir, and all the old folks were
given Christmas presents.
Poem
Pete Hall and Mysza deserve a
medal for getting up at 5.30 a.m.
(when's that?) to go to Covent
Garden to get the Christmas tree.
At the end of the party a vote of
thanks was given by Mr. Mill-
man, one of the old gentlemen
who recited a lo;ig poem. The
old people were then taken
home by volunteers from college.
The party was a great success and
it is good to know that so many
Icwarians will turn out to help
such a worthy cause.
G U I L D S P O T
The prophet spake and sayeth:
" There shalt be a Swimming
Gala;" and lo and behold on the
first day of December in the year
of our Lord nineteen hundred and
sixty-seven there was indeed a
swimming gala within the boun-
daries of the college named Im-
perial; and the three great tribes
of this college, being exceeding
wrathful with each other, did pro-
ceed to the water of combat in
specially armoured 43-seat cha-
riots, whose drivers did control
the many horses with much dex-
terity; and lo and behold they
made much use of that ritual
known since (he days of James
and Browne as the " handbrake
turn." Whereupon the other road
users did cry with many tongues
" Hallelujah" which is to say
" Thou f . . . ool chariot driver."
And after they abode for forty
minutes in WC2, they did
rive at the promised land, which
is known as Marshall Street
Baths.
And thereupon did battle com-
mence; and the waters were
parted as the high priests of the
three tribes were hurled in cere-
monial dress into the engulfing
waters; and there was great con-
fusion among the people. But
suddenly, there came upon the
assembled throng a silence for the
waters were turning purple! Then
quoth the prophet: "Yea, verily,
it is the great god, Permanganate
of Potash." And thus it was—
and the bath manager on seeing
this did cry aloud to the neavens
" L o and behold, thou hast
worked a miracle here with
heathen gods. Therefore depart
from here ye cursed ones into the
exterior darkness."
And thereupon the tribes did
depart from that sport for ever,
but no gnashing of teeth was ob-
served whilst investigating the
local hostelries.
So who said the pool was in-
violet?
Carnival
Apart from the non-event of
the swimming gala, action con-
tinues in Guilds right up to the
end of the Christmas term. Dick
James has organized a succession
of Carnival collections to try to
reach £1,000 before the end of
one term—almost a third of last
year's Carnival total. Congratu-
lations and many thanks to all
who were involved.
C. & G.U. Meeting
The final Union meeting of the
term was well attended by a noisy
and responsive audience who saw
the presentation of colours to the
Morphy and Lowry crews for
victories on Morphy Day. Some
of the more well known Guilds
personnel were then involved in
the portrayal of the situation in
a nearby castle, and finally a
suitably innocent person was
found guilty in the trial of the
Spanner bearers and punished
appropriately.
Soccer
Finally, congratulations to the
Guilds Soccer team who beat
RCS 2—0 in the first round of the
Tech cup—let's make sure we re-
tain this trophy in the next round.

O F M I N E S
Mr. M. von Kimmelman wishes to express his apologies to all
Minesmen for ruining the last issue of Felix by forgetting to write the
Gentlemen of Mines column and causing the editor to print that
libellous comment.
Freshers Falter
A major talking point among the old lags in Mines has been
the poor response of freshers in attending the various functions orga-
nised within Mines. We appeal to one and all to come along to
any of these occasions and you will realise the true spirit which exists
in Mines and which makes us unique in IC.
Foreign Miners at RSM
This week we are entertaining about twenty celebrated gentlemen
from various notable mining schools in Europe including some from
such far off countries as Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. An
extremely good programme culminating at IC's most splendid event of
the year, the Mines Ball, has been arranged by our foreign students'
officer, Charlie Savage, and it is up to everyone to support him so that
we can give our guests a truly memorable visit. Representatives
from Mines have been to Delft, Trondheim, Prague and St. Etiennc
this term and they have all been treated magnificently so we must
ensure that our visitors are treated equally well.
of Trophies and Pots and Mascots
At the union meeting last week the MacCartney Trophy, for
sporting prowess, was presented to cross country runner Howard
Smith (Met. 3) and the Freshers' Yard Pot was presented to I. Burgess
(Met. 1) for a time of 11 seconds. The venue for next term's MiniV
night was also fixed and although Phil Hopwood's suggestion was
unanimously accepted it was deemed impractical so that the outing
will be the Queen's Club for ice skating.
The meeting was told that Mines has acquired, out of Guilds
union, a yellow lion suffering from an impediment which could well
be foot and mouth (probably contracted from Dick James). A rather
large cardboard replica of a spanner was picked up in Southside last
week by two Minesmen and this has now been suitably decorated by
the Hon. Pornographer in preparation for public display in Mines
building. The yellow teddy bear which was Camborne School of
Mines' mascot has been removed from the union office and nothing
has been heard of it for several weeks, so if anyone knows anything
about this creature could they get in touch with anyone on the
union committee?
Blackmail or Blackcoat ?
Since appearing on Morphy Day in very poor garb Ian Wells has
been campaigning for a presidential coat and his demands have now
been met. The ladies of Mines have offered to create, in suitable
colours, a coat of similar design to, but more resplendent than, the
presidential coats of Guilds and RCS. In return for this deed the
ladies are asking for representation on the union committee and it is
rumoured that the leaders of this suffragette movement may soon be
seen chained to the railings outside Mines.
Black Memorial
A new award has been set up in Mines this year in memory of
the late Professor Black, of the Mining Department. Under this
award scheme, proposed by Mrs. Black, an RSM tie will be presented,
at the committee's discretion, each year to the coloured African
student who contributes most to the union in any non-academic field.
