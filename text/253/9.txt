Did anything happen to YOt/ last weekend? This was the sight
that greeted one Hall Resident on his return early one Monday
morning. If it takes one man one minute to crush one Newspaper . . .

" I suppose it's a sort of ill-
ness really—a sort of advanced
form of self-destruction. Per-
haps it stems from the intensity
of our work ; or the lack of fe-
males ; or absence of an arts
faculty, or something. Oh, please
help me. doctor. I must tell
someone. I must get it off my
chest—it all seems so pathetic,
but; well — it happened like
this . . .
. . . it was the night of De-
cember the first—-you remember?
The Friday of the RCS carnival.
It seemed funny they should ar-
range the swimming gala on the
same evening; but then the
whole thing had been a bit dis-
organised anyway.
About 80 of us went. They
laid on coaches which left from
the union at 6.30, or there-
abouts. We went to the Marshall
Street baths—we've been there
before and I think they're the
only ones in London that'll let
IC in.
It's a nice pool, doctor. When
we'd all sat down the swimmers
jumped in to practice—you see
IC's made up of three colleges
and the galas meant to be the
'yearly swimming competition.
We enjoy it usually, because we
can't resist the opportunity to
push our college committee into
the water—they all dress up for
this; and so that makes it even
more fun.
It was just after 7.30 that they
pushed Dick James in (he's the
Vice-President of our college).
Then some one at the back of the
Guilds stand threw a sort of
white packet into the water. I
didn't know what it was ; but no
one seemed very bothered so 1
ignored it. Anyway, about ten
minutes later the water suddenly
turned purple—must have been
that packet, I suppose—perhaps
it held potassium permanganate.
Soon after that the manager told
us to leave. It was a pity, really;
it looked as if the gala might
have been fun.
Each of the colleges went off
for a drink —• we all went to
different pubs, of course. It
wasn't the same, though. I had
been looking forward to the gala
too.
You see, doctor, it is rather
pathetic, isn't it ?
THE Y O U N G
TRADITION
" Like having a bath with your
socks on." This was how Royston
described singing through a
microphone. The Tradition—
Royston, Peter and Heather—
gave a polished performance of
unaccompanied singing. Their
songs are collected from varied
sources—many of them from
Harry Cox, and the Copper family
of Sussex. During theirfirstset,
they sang sea shanties and other
songs, and on their re-appearance
gave their excellent rendering of
the "Lyke Wake Dirge," amongst
others.
Since their visit to the Folk
Club last year, they have made
two LPs, and have appeared at
the Albert Hall and the Cam-
bridge folk festival ; wc hope to
see them again before tqo long.
Another guest was Gary Farr,
(formerly of the " T-Bones"), and
a friend Kevin. Farr was disap-
pointing : he is technically able,
and obviously sincere, but per-
haps he has yet to find the style
that suits him. He also played
at the RCS Carnival on Friday.
There is a wealth of players
within the Folk Club, and they,
as always, supported the guests.
Guilds
Punch up
On Friday night a section of
the Guilds party collecting for
Carnival became involved in a
fight in Leicester Square. The
trouble started about 11.20 after
BO had tun out of petrol, when
some of an approximately fifteen-
strong gang of drunks tried to
climb on to BO and started to
bend the headlamp.
Although there were about
fifty Guildsmen present, they
seemed to come off worst, at least
eight of them getting hit, includ-
ing Guilds President Chris
ODonnell and secretary Paul
Bradley, another lost his watch.
All the attackers got away, and
it is thought that only three of
them can bear any mementoes of
their evening.
It is believed that no Carnival
money was lost, but this is not
certain as the tins were not
counted when they were given
out. The proceeds of the even-
ing were £111. The damage to
BO, if any, was very slight.
M ines
Meeting
A Royal School of Mines
Union meeting was held in the
Mining Lecture Theatre on Tues.
5th December. Mr. Ian Wells
presided over the meeting as well
as a funny yellow lion and a
certain piece of engineering equip-
ment now painted yellow and
black. Claimants for the yellow
lion to Mines Union office, also
for the Guild's Spanner! Reports
from the Minesman who went to
Delft and Trondheim were heard.
Phil Hopwood urged support for
the charity collecting sessions and
said that Mines could collect
£1,000 for this year, as opposed
to last year's £400. A motion
for women students to have repre-
sentation on the commitee was
considered to be a constitutional
change and so could not be voted
on, as no advance notice had been
given. A vote was taken on where
to hold the next Mines night,
skating being favoured over the
dogs and Battersea Fun Fair. Mr.
Ian Wells asked for support for
the foreign students week and re-
minded Mines women that part-
ners were needed for the foreign
students at the Mines Ball. The
meeting ended at 2.35 p.m. with
Cats.
Ruhemann Resignation Rejected
At the last S.C.C. meeting, a
letter was received from Soc. Soc.
claiming that the lack of Union
meetings held this term was
restricting the activities of the
Clubs. They suggested that S.C.C.
should press for more meetings
in future. Chairman, Pete Ruhe-
mann, declared that in his opinion,
this was not S.C.C.'s business,
and it was beyond his scope to do
so. The ensuing discussion culmi-
nated infiveother clubs agreeing
with Soc. Soc. and a motion being
carried instructing the Chairman
to press for more meetings. The
Chairman immediately offered his
resignation, still claiming that it
was beyond his scope. After a
a tremendous vote of confidence
had been passed, he withdrew his
resignation. He is still mandated
to press for more Union meetings
in future.
