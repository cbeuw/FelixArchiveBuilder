LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
CULTURE
Dear Sir, I
I hope your editorial of last ~
tenn falls on fertile ground, to-
gether with Tony Hodgson's inspired
3uuporting viewpoint in the following
i33ue. for too long now, the problem
of producing cultured and responsible
students has been hedged around by
such questions as: Do the narrow-
minded scientist? need better Union
facilities? Or bigger halls of resi-
dence? Or more General Studies
lecture3?
Of course we need these things,
but let us keep our sense of proportion.
An average student spends le3s than a
quarter of his time i n Union activi-
ties. Living in a purely internal
hall at an all-science college like
I.C, is hardly going to help students
adjust to society i n general. And
General Studies lectures s t i l l bear
for most, however deplorably, the
stigma of being either, 'potted' or
trirj : upon them.
Most of a student'3 active l i f e
(for good or i l l ) is spent i n study.
Obviously, i t is academically that the
student must be reached by the arm of
'culture'. How can this be done? Kow
can we acquire a 3ense of vocation, a
feeling of responsibility - things
wnich storm from a real and fundamental S
respect for our subjects? Not by the
present method of ten lectures a week,
then go home and read i t up.' Or frcm
the idea that science is a set of facts
alone, which must be temporarily absor-
bed and then unburdened in the next
examinations.
What is required, first and fore-
most, is decent teaching, not lectures
by cast-off researchers copied hurried-
ly out of text-books. We nav- enough
specialist research workers on the
staff. Why not a few specialist
teachers? They could give a l l but the
most advanced courses, and they would
bo chosen for their enthusiasm and
humanity. Human inspiration is the
stuff of l i f e , science included. No
amount of impersonal talk can replace
the influence of the natural teacher,
particularly in the early years at
College.
In this way proper unity could
be given to the present sets of dis-
jointed, unrelated courses. And in
this way, methods of thought may be
stressed, instead of facts alone
being rammed down our throats.
As support for such lecture-
room improvements, there should be a
much enlarged tutorial system, and
perhaps also junior colloquia for
vigorous discussions amongst under-
graduates. A l l the staff, professors
included, should give tutorials, while
a student should have more than one
tutor, and more tutorials than the
present quota of one shared hour every
week or two. Only through constant
personal contacts can students get an
impression of the real nature of scien-
t i f i c thought and research, and only by
first-class teaching can they develop
any sort cf maturity.
It is from this maturity in our
daily thought and work, the closest end
strongest influence on us, that real
culture can spring.
Let us set this present state of
affairs in order first, and worry about
our recreation later. We'll even tackle
this much the better as a result.
Yours etc.,

PLASTIC SANDWICHES
Dear Sir,
I am amazed and appalled at the
gross stupidity of whoever i s res-
ponsible for installing the plastic-
coated counter in the Sandwich Bar.
Surely a purely passing observation
of the conditions in that pigsty would
show that the money frittered away on
a powder-blue Formica top could be much
better spent.
Why is there no room to eat in
comfort? Why do we have those bulky
moth-eaten sofas, Union rejects? Why
are there no plates, no glasses for
milk, no milk boiler? Furthermore,
the cafeteria atmosphere induced de-
tracts considerably from the useful-
ness of the room for other functions.
Do not imagine that we are un-
grateful for having money spent on U3,
but we are not impressed by pretty
colours and fancy woodwork.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
Sandwich.
'<ot Lord Sandwich.
UNSUPPORTED
Dear Sir,
Once again the I.C. Dramatic
Society has given us an entertaining
play, well anted and produced with
considerable s k i l l , and providing a
very pleasant evening's entertainment.
But once again, on Tuesday evening,
the House was less than a quarter f u l l ,
which is extremely poor reward for the
hard work put in by both the actors
and production staff: not only is a
f u l l house essential to create the
best atmosphere for a comedy, but i t
also helps the actors to become more
confident in their parts.
If more members of I.C. would
take the opportunity to 3ee one of
these productions, they would be
assured of f u l l value for their money
and would help to make the effort of
the Sooiety more worth while, and they
might even be tempted to go again i n
the future.
Yours faithfully,
P.J. Crabtree.
Editor's notes
This agonising plea for bigger
audiences for the Dra-a. Soc. has be-
come a biannual institution at I.C.
It i s about time that the Society
stepped moaning and asked itself why
i t happens to them and not to the
Musical Society, for example.
Now, the Musical Society's
activities are a part of daily Col-
lege l i f e for many people. The lunch
time concerts, record recitals and
lectures keep people, including non-
performers, interested and sympathetic.
The Dramatic Society on the other hand
produces its two plays a year in
a manner reminiscent of a chicken lay-
ing an egg, only an occasional gallery
party relieving the intervening tedium._
There are many more things that
the Dram, Soc. could do to attract
interest and support. A well known
author, actor or producer, for ex-
ample, would be a great draw for a
lecture or demonstration of his art.
Again before the performance of a play
the author might be induced to come
and talk about i t . Long-playing
records of plays by Shakespeare and
others, new techniques i n writing and
performing plays - a l l these afford
scope for original and enterprising
ideas, and i t is about time that
advantage was taken of them.
SENIOR COMMON ROOM
IDear Sir,
^ Hon much longer are the members
of the Union going to stagnate i n their
apathetic stupor and allow a gross mis-
carriage of bureaucracy to continue in
the building designed for their own
convenience? I refer to the fatuous
situation that i s now present in the
Senior Common Room. How much longer
are we to l e t a small group of coffee
drinking, cheaply fed, inhospitable
Senior Cotnnon Poom members monopolize
a room whose importance in the Union
building needs no explanation?
Negotiations recommended by the
Union last year appear to have reached
a deadlock through the inflexibility
of the Senior Common Room in their
endeavour to segregate themselves from
the student body even though there are,
as we a l l know, more lounges for the
staff members only than for the two
thousand or so students.
It recently happened that a group
of students was unable to watch the te-
levised F.A.Cup semi-final replay, in
the Reading Room. Naturally assuming
that the staff are human, and recipro-
cate the tolerance shown by students
to them, they went into the S.C.R. to
watch there. However this so provoked
and enraged a member of the S.C.R. as
to demand i f a l l were Union members
and to go so far, quite beyond his
rights which appeared incidental, as
to ask far Union cards.
Assuming that originally the
hope was to encourage free contact
with student and staff, as was Hall
Dinner, then i t has failed miserably.
Only i f we see the S.C.R. as a con-
venient coffee lounge near cheap food
for S.C.R. members, a facility which
is not available to the students who
are without doubt of prime importance
in that building, is i t a success.
If the members of staff who use
the Union building want to be apart
from the students let them go elsewhere;
the Dining Hall is pleasant enough,
the students give the place atmosphere ,
which impresses visitors, but we are
not a zoc, we are not a showpiece, we
are a living organism that must be
operated efficiently and so oannot
afford luxuries such as the S.C.R.
By a l l mean3 l e t us have members of
staff to dine, wine, lunch and munch
but not to slink off and drink i n
isolation.
Yours, Benediotus Benedioat.
NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT
Dear Sir,
At lasti I.C. has i t s own Commit-
tee far Nuclear Disarmairent - a matter
which i s surely the particular concern
of I.C. students since 30 many of us
will eventually help to produce nuclear
arms. The committee has the support
of people with widely differing r e l i -
gious and political views.
A meeting i s to be organized for
the evening of the 8th May when several
prominent speakers will propose the
case. On the 20th May, a delegation
will be sent to the National Peace
Lobby at the House of Commons where i t
is hoped a large contingent will re-
present I.C.
If you are dissatisfied with the
present trends i n Nuclear Policy, you
are invited to get in touch with any
of the signatories below, and lend us
your support.
Yours sincerely,
