About seventy people turned up for
trials and practices at Harlington this
y ;ar. Many of the newcomers were of
quite high standrrd, making team selec-
tion a difficult task.
The season opened successfully
for the l s t XI who beat "Hye College by
nine wickets, on a difficult r>itoh.
One of the most pleasing features was
the fielding of the I.C. terjn, which
was a vast improvement over last year.
The trip to Wye was an outstanding
success, due in part to the fact that
the team were accompanied by the I.C.7/.
S.C. tennis team. It was noticeable
that on the downward journey one team
sat at tin. back of the coach and the
other at the front, on the return
journey positions were shuffled, prov-
ing that Sport brings people closer
together.
The 2nd XI had a less haopy time
at Harlington against the Institute
of Education and only managed to draw
the match.
The third eleven, however, started
the season with a fine win over W
e
m
-
bley 3rd XI.

On Saturday 29th March 290 crews
entered for the London "Head of the
Hiver" race from Mortlake to Putney,
of these, seven were I.G. crews who
had stayed a week after the end of
term to row in the gruelling l£ miles
race.
The conditions were quite good
apart from a fierce head wind on the
final stretch from Hammersmith Bridge
to Putney. This was the downfall of
many crews, including the I.C. 2nd
VIII, who were only a few seconds
3lower than I.C. l s t VIII at Hammer-
smith but ended up some 50 places lower.
The I.C. l s t VIII did very well
to move up from l6th to 12th place.
They caught the crew in front near
Chiswick Syot but that crew would not
move over to allow the I.C. boat to
pass (as is the rule in rowing) and the
I.C. boat was forced to go wide out
of the stream, thus losing valuable
seconds.
Due mainly to increased opposi-
tion the only other I.C. crew to better
its position was the 6th VIII, com-
posed of freshers with some previous
rowing experience, who moved up about
30 placeJfrom l&Vth.
However, a l l the I.C. crews enjoyed
their Head Night Dinner. The Coxes
hod also supped with coxes from various
clubs at the annual I.C. Coxwain3'
Society Dinner the previous Thursday.
The Boat Club hopes to reap the records
of i t s winter training in the coming
regatta season.

The triangular meeting held at the
end of last term resulted in a com-
fortable victory for I.C.(68 pts.)
over L.S.E. (48) and Q.M.C. (46).
Star of the match was Alan Brown who
achieved 2nd. place in the pole-vault
with 2' l£".
This term's activities began with
the Trials and a Pentathlon competit-
ion. In the former, "Gorb" Newman -
an old hand at the field events - won
both the discus and shot events. Many
athletes entered our Pentathlon, in
which five events are chosen from nine
track and field events. The result was
unexpected, as a trackman, Keith Ludlam.
proved victorious with a total of 2427
points. His performances were: 100m,
(11,4s.)768pts. 400m,(52,6s.)666pts.
HJ (4'6n
) 372 pts. LJ (18'3") 415pts.
Shot (22'3") 206 pts.
A.Abbott, spurred on by the prize of
5 cigs.,was second with 2341 points.
On April 26th. I.C. athletes upheld
the prestige of the College in the
University Trials. Outstanding perfor-
mers on the track included B.Curtis
(220), K.W.Ludlam (440), P.Rayment(880),
J.S.Evans (mile), J.H.Collins (2 miles),
and V/.Melbourne (hurdles). Dave Smith
dominated the field events with a mag-
nificent HSJ of 45'7".
On the same day, an I ,C. team beat
Westminster Hospital by 75 pts. to 55,
Great promise was shown by fresher
J.B.Breckon who won three field events,
HJ, LJ, and HSJ.
Sports Day
Two events of the annual Athletic
Sports have already been held. The
three miles was held at Parliament
Hill on 19th. March. This event has
for long been a most interesting struggle
between H.C.S. and Guilds, who this
year were again very evenly matched,
and the result was extremely close,with
Guilds winning by 28 pts. to 30.
Unfortunately, illness prevented several
athletes from running but the two Coll-
eges were equally affected. Three
B.C.S. men finished in the f i r s t four
positions, but Guilds then packed in
a bunch of five runners which decided
the result.
Individual results:
1. D.Briggs (ECS) 14m. 50s.
2. J.Conway (C&G)
3. J.Collins (RCS)
4. M.Barber (HC8)
5. K.Wall (C&G)
6. G.Tilly (C&G).
An Innovation this year waa the
Steeplechase, won by Guilds with B.C 1,
second - Mines not entering a team.
The early pace was set by K.Wall, who
built up a considerable lead, but J-F.
Jaeger closed the gap In the last few
laps and, finishing with a strong sprint,
won by several yards.
All the other events in the ST>-ts
will take place on MAT 14th. at
M0TSPUH PARK. Why not come to Sports
Day - you are given an official Coll-
ege half-day for this purpose. Coach
tickets (2/- ret.) may be purchased
from the Bookstall.
