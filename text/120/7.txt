The Musical Society sprang into
the public ear towards the end of
last tern with two presentations -
a performance of Bach's Mass in B
Minor by the College Choir, followed
a week later by Gilbert and Sullivan's
"The Mikado.1
'
Both the Mass and the Savoy Opera
drew f u l l houses, the latter for four
nights running, enhancing the already
considerable reputation of the Society.
To quote THE TIMES;
"It is the aim of the conductors
of most university choirs that
every student-member should sing
Bach's B Minor Mass during his or
her university career. Many of
those taking part in the performance
by the Imperial College Choir on
Wednesday evening must have been
singing this work for the first time,
and i t is greatly to the credit of
their conductor, Dr. Eric Brown,
that they sang with sureness and
conviction. Responding well to a
clear and steady beat, with perfect
intonation throughout, they pro-
duced some exciting moments, but
were not yet able to sustain this
excitement."
The singing in "The Mikado" too
was of a high standard, and under the
expert direction of Mr. Prank Kennard
the hardworking oast gave a very
spirited performance. Stafford Dean,
as the Mikado, and Michael Amos, as
Ko-Ko, were outstanding â€¢ However, a
l i t t l e more care could have been taken
with the props. The backed.oth was
that used for the Guilds carnival, and
showed i t , while reflection from the
sellotapo holding Katisha's fan to-
gether was no less obvious.
These sucoessful productions of
the Musical Society underline once
again the strong musical tradition of
+he Colletre. Incidentally, i t is a
fact that performers queue up to give
lunch-hour conce ts at I.C., apprecia-
ting the "civilised audience and atmos-
phere," before going on to broadcasts.
I.C. occupies an accepted niche in
London's musical world and i t i s ob-
viously vital to maintain our musical
facilities. It is to be hoped that
during the expansion of the College
and after, these facilities will be
carefully safeguarded.

Prom the day we arrived i n Groningen
this tour had the promise of success.
W
e arrived during a snowstorm but the
weather quickly changed, giving us fine
sunny days for the rest of the tour,
enabling us to complete a l l our fix-
tures.
However, these were of minor import-
ance, sines the main purpose of the
tour was to meet Dutch students, to
learn their ways, sad to teach them a
few Old English customs. We were
fortunate in that there were no lang-
uage dlfflenities, our hosts being
eager to practise their English
In Groningen our hosts were the m

-
bers of Forward Hookey Club, a student
society of the Univ. of Groningen. The
highlight of our stay was a feast, i n
eelebration of Forward winning the
Forth Netherlands Hookey Tournament.
As at a l l other feasts, our team dis-
played great ability i n the art of
alcoholic imbibition.
Two matches were played in Groningen.
The first, against Groningen Catholic
Students, was drawn 1 - 1; our goal,
the f i r s t of the tour, was appropriately
scored by the Captain, H.G.King. The
second match, against Forward, was also
a draw 1 - 1 (soorer R.Lee). Our stay
in Groningen was concluded with a
dinner given by us for our Dutch friends

followed by a dance, the highlight of
whioh was a Jive display by our goal-
keeper 'Sham'.
Unfortunately, the following morning
we had to take the road to Utrecht at
6:00 am.,where we played in one section
of the Dutch universities Hookey Tour-
nament. W
e won our seotion, but we
retired to let the runners-up play i n
the final, whioh they won. Our thanks
are due to the Dutch Universities
Athletio Association for allowing us
to play and for entertaining us after-
wards.
And so to Delft, famous for Delft
Blue China and for Engineers (6000 of
them), which is a typical University
town and is an ideal touring centre.
Here we played our hardest gams when
we drew 2 - 2 with Delft Studentum.
The Delft side contained one of their
two internationals, and were favourites
to win the Netherlands Club Champion-
ship. However, thanks to fine goals
by Lee and Holmes and a splendid effort
by the defence, we managed to maintain
our unbeaten record.
Our last game waa against Delft
Sanetus Yirglllus, in which the team
rounded off a fine tour by winning
6 - 1 .
Tour record:
P 8 1 4 1 4 L O F 15 A 5 .
From Delft we visited the Hague , and
later Amsterdam, where, with spokes-
man Bhatnagar persuading the proprietor
to allow us a cheap rate, we toured the
famous canals by barge, seeing many
places of repute. After a farewell
party at Delft, there followed much
merrymaking on the overnight oroasing.
Our thanks are due to our hosts for
their hospitality, the Union for i t s
support, and Messrs. King and Rees for
their hard work in organisation.
This waa a fitting end to a most
successful season, in whioh the Club
has lost only 17 matches out of 55.
W
e have regularly turned out three
teams, and with a l i t t l e more support
i t should be possible to form a 4th.
