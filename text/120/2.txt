VAC Q U I R K
An article on Vacation Work
recently appeared i n our oontemporary
THE TIMES. The opinions expressed
were, surprisingly enough, not those
of students, hut of professors and
tutors.
It i s most revealing to find that
we do not apparently need the money we
earn - we save up"for a car, or a
radio, or even a dinner jacket* accord-
ing to a Yorkshire professor, who
added that most of us come "from work-
ing-class families where a lusty young-
ster was expsotsdto contribute something
to the home . . . where in many oases
brothers and sisters had been doing so
since they were 15". From Scotland we
are told that we work "for the prestige"
from Oxford "undergraduates like t a l l
stories to t e l l . " Everyone agreed
that finanoe did not usually enter
into the matter but " i f you hunted,
around you might find a hard case or
two, especially among the older stu-
dents."
How very naive! The maximum grant
of a student ia of the order of £270
p.a. - It i s rather absurd to think
that this alone can suffice to main-
tain a student for a year, without re-
course to earning.
"Some dons heartily disapprove (of
vac. work).... arguing that i f under-
graduates stopped using the vacation
for serious study there must be a f a l l
in standards" and "with a three year
course...the heavy spade-work must be
done i n vacation or not at a l l . " On
the other hand one of our own tutors,
presumably referring to approved vac.
work "had a further idea: 'most of
the younger tutors here don't like to
see their students going off to work
at a l l ; there i s a general feeling
that this is the time far that broader
education everybody says the techno-
logist should havel"
At last the powera-that-be have
seen a l i t t l e light, and have come
round to the inevitable - that i n gen-
eral I.C. i s producing relatively
narrow-minded graduates. Agreed, the
vac. i s an excellent time to broaden
our minds but working w i l l not pre-
vent this as long as the Job i s con-
sidered as a means to an end, and not
an end in itself. Many I.C. students
travel to Canada and Europe through
Mr. Newby's Offloe - this can surely
have no narrowing influence. Most
jobs, either directly or indirectly,
afford the opportunity of increased
personal contact and travel, two
essential prerequisites of a broad
mind.
Finally: "The Association of
university Teachers decided cautiously
(in 1956) that undergraduates should
be allowed to work, but not for too
long." So i t looks as ifwe shall be
free . . . to peddle bathing beauty
contests, when we might be brushing
up our Plato."

This Easter a party of about
twenty students,mainly from I.C. and
Bedford College, embarked on the 100
mile canoe trip down the Wye from
Glezbury to Tintern", a l l but two
finished the course. Despite b i t -
terly cold nights, leaking canoes and
very wet water, there were no regrets
and true to their training the I.C.
men found a camping site within a
few minutes walk of a pub every evening.

a man of very wide interests, one of
his hobbies being the dismemberment of
old taxi-cabs.
EUROPEAN UNION DEBATED
The Union Debate Was held on
March 11th with John Chadwiok in the
chair. The motion was an elongated
version of "That this House i s i n
favour of Britain's participation i n
a European Economic Union." Mr.
John Briggs-Daviea, M.P. spoke i n
favour, dwelling, chiefly On the
necessity of using the European
aarket i f our industries are to survive.
He was apposed by Mr. Martin Madden
M.F. who feared that Britain might lose
much of her independence under such a
scheme. Of the seconding speakers Mr.
Robert Finch impressed particularly
by his obvious sincerity and good
command of the problem.
The floor speeches showed that
moat I.C. men have not really the
sped si 1 sod-knowledge for this kind
of motion and only Mr. David Stevens,
speaking against the motion, and emphas-
izing the direct threat to Britain's
livelihood from the rapidly develop-
ing German industries, suggested that
there was anything l e f t to say after
the paper speeches were over. The
House divided, and the motion was
carried by a small majority.

This was of course doubly convenient,
although there was one near disaster
when i t was found that the pubs don't
open i n Monmouthshire on Sundays —
however the border was only a few miles
away.. The night l i f e of Monmouth was
livened up the following evening whan
one I.C. man of strong olliWng
instincts found himself suspended
several feet above the bald head of
the local publican.
Despite two people get-
ting wet on the f i r s t day, i t
was not long before people
were anxious to test their
s k i l l (and oanvaa) at every
rapid. However one elec-
trical engineer managed to
deposit his canoe half way up
a tree and a gallant Miner
had to dive into ten feet of
near freezing water to save
his lady passenger from being
forever marooned on a tree
trunk i n aid-stream. He later
set fire to his tent, but this
was quite accidental and noth-
ing to do with his desire to
get dried out.

At Kerne Bridge the station-
master became enraged at the steady
stream of canoeists making use of his
station facilities, siaoe ha was
obliged to pump the water up from the
river by hand. He must have spoken to
the local bobby, who created near panic
that evening by telling the party that
water vas being released from a reser-
voir upstream and that the water level
was expeoted to rise 15 f t * overnight.

"Some hou3e3 of lioensed prosti-
tution i n Kyoto are now going to be
turned into student hostels as the
new Anti-Prostitution Law will be put
into effect on April 1 and ^e red-
light districts are to be closed con-
sequently. The project was born when
same representatives of the universi-
ties i n Kyoto talked with members of
the Kyoto Women's Association. It i s
now studied by a committee oompoaed
of two students, two representatives
of the Women's Association, and two
public accountants who have to con-
sider problems concerning rent, hostels
for women students and the improvement
of rooms."
