Ths General Studies Gcromittee is
sparing no effort to secure visiting
lecturers who are authorities in their
fields and can he relied upon to he
interesting and lively. Five have
been appointed for next session, and
will form the nucleus of an extreme-
ly varied programme.
C. Day Lewis and L.A.G. Strong,
neither of whom need any introduction
will give between them a series on
Modern Poetry and the Poet in theory
and at work. Dr. David Thomson,

CLIMBING ON
B O N N Y T Y N E S I D E
Like many Southerners I used to
think that England finished somewhere
roundabout Yorkshire, so when I was
persuaded to take my climbing holiday
there, i t came as a surprise to find
that Tyneside i s not in Scotland.
The Consett Climbing Club,at which
I stayed,lies about fifteen miles
from Newcastle,and one finds the olub
camp as an inconspicuous cluster of
Nissen huts nestling under the steel
works.
One does not appreciate
that Tyneside i s suoh an excellent
climbing region until one sees t he
thousands of conical pit-heaps decora-
ting the countryside. Like Mount Snow-
don, many of these have railways to the
summit, allowing the less energetic to
see a wonderful panorama of the coal-
field.
The climba for the most part are
for novices, and for the more experien-
ced olimber the olub arranges "pot-
holing" expeditions to disused coal-
mines. It i s one of the ambitions of
the Consett Club to emulate the feat
of their rivals - the Shotley Miners
Welfare Sub-Terra Club, who a few years
ago discovered a hitherto unknown seven-
foot coal seam in a disused mine. The
National Coal Board in a moment of
weakness awarded them £500 for their
disoovery.
Beginners usually take about four
or five days to graduate to the stiffer
pit-heap ascents and after about a week
are allowed on their first trip under-
ground. The main shafts are as a rule
uninteresting and the more commer-
cialised mines run special l i f t s to
get to the best climbs.
Once a week a coach trip to
Newcastle is laid on to see the morality
play 'Cinderella on Toast'. These
trips are very popular, not only be-
cause of the show but also for the a l -
most forgotten benefits of modem
sanitation. A l l i n a l l despite the
language difficulties the climber i s
sure of a cheap open a i r holiday with
good food and the opportunity to make
a judicious collection of rock speci-
ments to reduce the winter fuel b i l l .
Europe, will lecture on "Europe since
1900", while A.J. Taylor, an up-and-
coming lecturer at U.C. and a f i r s t -
class speaker, will discuss "England
since 1851." The inimitable Antony
Hopkins will continue his series on
"The Enjoyment of Music? Individual
lectures being arranged include
"Education in the U.S.S.R.", "Science
and Crime" by L.C. Nickolls, and
"Modern Marriage" by a member of the
National Marriage Guidance Council.
At the request of the Staff
Christian Association, a short series
of lectures on the problem of nuclear
weapons has been arranged, and several
well-known personalities have accepted
invitations to take part. Professor
J. Rotblat, Michael Howard (lecturer
in Military Studies at King's College),
Sir G.P. Thomson and Professor Dame
Kathleen Lonsdale will take part. It
was hoped that the latter two would
speak against each other, but Sir
George declined on the grounds that
time would be so short that a duet
was not justified. Nevertheless, i t
is hoped that a thorough airing and
interchange of views will take place.

On Monday and Tuesday April 21-
22 the Railway Society combined visits
to Swansea and Wolverhampton with jour-
neys over some of the many scenic lines
in the mountains and valleys of South
and Central Wales.
The South Wales Pullman conveyed
the party to Newport where the only
diesel train which could not be ex-
cluded from the itinerary was Joined
for the trip up the valley to Ponty-
pool. From there the route was via
Quaker's Yard to Merthyr and thence
to Swansea where, after a ride on the
Swansea and Mumbles Railway, the
travellers spent the night.
The second days 3 i hour journey
to Shrewsbury over the heavily graded
ex- L.N.W.B* Central Wales line (noted
more for the beauty of i t s scenery
than for the frequency of i t s train
service) was very exciting, especially
on the steep and sharply curved descent
from Sugar Loaf Summit. The engine
crew knew there were enthusiasts on the
train and their memory of the speed
restrictions appeared an-occasion to
lapse.
The return from Shrewsbury to
London was broken at Wolverhampton for
a v i s i t to the Stafford Road Works of
the Western Region where locomotives
were seen undergoing various types of
repair.
Although this excursion was not
so well supported as those of the
last two years, i t was every b i t as
successful and the Visits Secretary i s
to be congratulated on the efficiency
of the organisation.

WHAT MANNER OF
sH
IS THIS?
The effect of the new photo-front
Phoenix will only be equalled when the
refectory starts serving fish wrapped
up i n five pound notes. It says a
great deal for the design and lay-
out that over thirteen hundred m
e
m
-
bers of the Union were sufficiently
interested to investigate further.
Was i t the same old ood — or perhaps
a ooelaoanth cutlet ?.
Attention was inevitably fooussed
on the "Anthology on Women," occupying
as i t did one third of the issue. Un-
fortunately, i n such a prominent po-
sition i t was not an unqualified suc-
cess, due mainly to the ohoioe of sub-
ject and i t s frivolous treatment. An
eight-page anthology on a less worn
topic might provide a more suitable
vehicle for the talent of the Phoenix
staff. Virtually the only counter-
weight to this lightheadedness was
Dr. Weals's serious note and the dis-
cussion of the Imperial University.
The Editor and his staff have obviously
put a great deal of work into this
Phoenix, and deserve congratulation,
but their efforts merit a mora bal-
anced display.

On the morning of 12th April,
eleven members of the R.C.S. Motor
Club left the College on what proved
to be one of the most adventurous
journeys yet undertaken with Jezebel
She behaved perfectly, as is ex-
pected of her, until Edgware,when a
mysterious coughing started on the
numerous up-grades. This was stopped
by keeping her petrol tank topped up
but this remedy soon proved insufficient.
However, air was blown through the pet-
rol feed system to clear a partial
blockage.
By the time Silverstone was
reached the day had warmed up and the
crew^ thinking a l l their troubles
ended, settled down in the paddock
to enjoy a good day's racing.
Later, however, a slight leak
was noticed i n Jezebel's radiator.
Enough chewing gum was bought to
chew the way home, but this pre d
ineffective, as did R.dw.ld. After
numerous stops far water and one due
to a police warning that "your
museum piece i s trailing water," the
fire-engine reached home. She has
now been restored to f u l l health.
