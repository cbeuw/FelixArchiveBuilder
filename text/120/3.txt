TOUCHSTONE
F E L I X
F R E E D O M A N D S E C U R I T Y
The guest speaker on this occasion
waa Maurice Cranston, a frequent con-
tributor to the MANCHESTER GUARDIAH and
a prise-winning biographer. The in-
clusion of two guests from L.S.E. was
a further guarantee of an interesting
weekend — i f such a guarantee he need-
ed.
Mr. Cranston discussed three basic
problems - political, social and econ-
omic. Mill pointed out i n the 19th
Century that i n addition freedom from
State intervention, one needed freedom
from social conformation and from the
pressure of public opinion up to the
point where one is interfering with the
freedom of others. Thirdly economic
freedom was required, for in Victorian
The last Carnival of the year,
•Kimono My House" by R.C.S., was rather
disappointing. It started promisingly
enough and went with a swing until the
cabaret. The ensuing chaos was mainly
due to the presence of drunken insurgents
from the Rugger Club, presumably s t i l l
celebrating their victory over Kings,
and the positioning of the bar on the
stage did not help matters. The cabaret
was potentially quite promising but,
due to obvious lack of rehearsal, did
not come over at all well. It opened
with an epic of the Wild Hast: Wynot
Burp i n "That's Rioe in them thar h i l l s "
- the story of how a one rickshaw town,
transformed into a bad city overnight
by a rich strike nearby, was cleaned
up by the hardhitting sheriff Wynot
Burp.
The next turn was a Chinese
defective story entitled "The Case of
the missing Chopstick", whioh went
completely astray, and was mercilessly
barracked by an impatient audience.
After an unecessarily long inter-
val, due to the microphones being
broken by drunks, the band started
playing until the early hours of the
morning; but the music they produced
was very disjointed, with long gaps
between the numbers totally spoiling
the atmosphere; as one g i r l put i t
"Just as you get i n the mood, the
b y band stops." The I.C. Jazs
Band, whioh had been playing upstairs,
took over at about five o'clock,con-
tinuing in t i l a l l the weary bodies
had retired to bed.
H.P.K.
GUILDSMANS EYE VIEW
Carnival cabarets are never blesse
with good behaviour, and regular inter-
jections from the revellers are usual.
However R.C.3., in addition, had to
suffer attacks from their rear flanks.
At times i t seemed that everything
would end in disorder, at one stage
the lighting gallery was beseiged by
two drunken rugger players, however,
the programme was i n the main completed
and thanks are due to the bar staff
far rt/rrting an ugly situation.
Daring a back-stage fracas, a group of
drunks assailed the bar stocks,
helping themselves to beer and other
drinks, including a half bottle of
whisky. It is no wonder that the
bar made a loss when suoh behaviour
was taking place. The shams i s even
worse when one considers that a mem-
ber of Union Council was standing
talking to the niaoreants.
Footnote: The whisky was paid for
later when the thief had sobered up,
other than that, none of the other
drinks were paid for.
J.K.T.
gnp/i *nA domestic servants and others
were i n Marx's words 'wags slaves'.
The only answer was socialism with
the degree of security and economic
freedom balanced against a loss of
political freedom. More contro-
versial was the teaching of Rousseau
who considered that the freedom to de
what one should do mas all-important.
The speaker further pointed out i t i s
probably an Anglo-Saxon illusion that
a l l people want freedom.
On the subjeot of democracy' Mr
Cranston questioned whether the
"Peoples' Democracies" or the Western
democracies are a good approximation
to true government by the people.
Democracy cannot be government by the
majority as this tends to neglect
minority interests, whether the min-
ority be religious, social or economic.
He believed that the essence of democ-
racy lay i n the interplay of ideas in
free discussion. However, when this
point was considered along with censor-
ship and other questions i n the later
discussion, many believed that the
freedom tc change the government oc-
casionally is, after a l l , the best
safeguard of democracy.
HOSTEL RENTS GO UP
Next session w i l l see an increase
in the rent of most rooms in the Old,
New and Garden Hostels. An extra £1
a term i s to be charged, raising the
rent of a room in the New Hostel, for
example, from £19.10.0 to £20.10.0
for the Autumn and Spring Terms, and
from £18.0.0 to £19.0.0 for the
Summer Term. Vacation rents and charges
for visitors w i l l also go up, but there
w i l l be no change in the rents of the
shared rooms i n the Garden Hostel.
The reason for the increased
charges i s the oost of the recent re-
decoration of the Hostels, and the fact
that much of the bedlinen will shortly
need replacing, to say nothing of some
well-known beds.

CONGRATULATIONS on their recent

NELSON hears that the authorit-
ies at Les Angeles City College
and at Michigan State University,
both co-educational establish-
ments, have stopped girl students
from attending classes in shorts.
They said i t was "too distract-
ing." Lecturers should learn to
oontrol themselves.
A suggestion for Hr.mboney.-
There is now available some new
hotplate equipment that gives,
among other things, a top plate
and a hot oloset, each with
three degrees of heat. Every
whim of the kitchen staff is
thus catsred for.
ON the first of April Dr.Sparkes,
Godfather of the new Union build-

STATUE
THE SOLTJTIOH T
T H E W R E C K E R S M O V E IN
In preparation for the erection
of Weeks Hall, the Job of demolishing
noa. 16-18 Prince's Gardens has recent-
ly been started. This Hall i s expect-
ed to be completed by October 1959.
No authority has yet been received
from the University Grants Committee
to go ahead with the demclition of the
houses on the South Side of the square.
In the meantime, the proposed designs
for the hostels i n Prince's Gardens
will be on view at the Sumner Exhib-
ition of the Royal Academy, together
with those far the Island site.
Observant members of the Union w i l l
have noticed that several changes have
taken place recently i n the College's
gardens in Prince's Gardens. Nov look-
ing much tidier, and with considerably
fewer laurel bushes, they are begin-
ning te take on a new lease of l i f e .
Changes have also been made in the
Victorian statuary adorning the centre
flower bed. The original figure of a
bashful nude has been removed from i t s
place of honour and now surveys the
scene from the back of the American
School. In i t s place i s a large stone
Urn that i s said to have oome rVcm the
collection of relics of the 1851
Exhibition. The advantages of this
change arc not yet apparent, but time
s i l l doubtless t e l l .
