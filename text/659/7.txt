Last Saturday, 'Silly Sports' outside
Harrods was a great success with about
£1011 being collected and about the same
number of people being annoyed.
And of course on Sunday, Guilds stuffed
RCS and Mines at the raft race across the
Serpentine and back.
Don't miss the Guilds Carnival tonight,
the last and best event of Rag Week.
Tomorrow, Saturday, the Guilds 135
club, which is a club that intends visiting all
139 Youngs pubs (not in one evening
though) to gain a tie, free barrel of beer and
brewery trip each, is having its first trip, to
Wandsworth, the fatherland of Youngs
pubs. Meet in the Union Bar at 6.30pm.
Finally on Wednesday is the famous
Morphy Day so we need lots of people,
suitably dressed, to turn up at the Guilds
Office at 12.30pm.
from the flames, Morphy Day. If you want
to come and fling crap at Guilds and Mines,
or want some bits of an oar, or just want to
watch RCS stuff the others in the boat race,
then meet in the office, 12.30-lpm for
equipment. It will cost you the return fare to
Putney.
The street collection raised £1118 and
with Silly Sports, a total of £1600 was raised
on the licence. The highest RCS collector
was Matt Smith with £89.19

Now we've reached the end of Rag Week,
or nearly so, we still have for your
delectation and delight, A Million and One

down darts, all weekend in the Southside
Lower Lounge (next to the bar) and then on
Wednesday we have, rising like a Phoenix
The floor collapsed and we hit hard
vacuum. The ship spiralled away below
me, fatally wounded and bleeding air to
the stars. Jolenta, unsuited, screamed
silently as blood exploded from her
nose and mouth. She would die shortly,
as her lungs exploded and spliied their
red harvest. Shit! i thought, now I
couldn't take her to the SF Soc Call My
Bluff against FAUX on Monday, 28th
November in the Upper Lounge. I
consoled myself with the fact that I
could drown my sorrows in Section 10.
It was then that I noticed a sharp pain in

Dear Readers,
Pete is felling a little sick this week and
has asked me to step into the driver's seat to
tell you all about something very special.
From December 1st, IC Radio will be
FIVE YEARS OLD, which means it can
now dress itself, blow its own nose and write
in joined up letters. To celebrate, we are
having a BIG PARTY in Southside Bar with
lots of beer and free cake to yummy. It starts
at 8pm on Friday 1st, so come along and eat,
drink and fall over with the rest of us.
There's a 'whole new look to IC Radio'
(retch) between 7 and 8pm during the week,
too. If you missed 'Roundtable' on
Saturday, you can hear it again on Monday;
on Tuesday, I climb into the cockpit and
burn my way to Funkadelic Freedom with
the new Sould Sounds from the UK and the
US of A; on Wednesday, Chris Yates plays
music from the 50's and 60's and on
Thursday, Aidan Kirkpatrick opens his Old
Record Club, looking at the charts of years
gone by.
hugs and kisses,
Captain Scarlet (Ms).
