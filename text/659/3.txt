Beer Money for students
A threatened increase'in the price
of a pint in College bars has been
averted at least until Christmas
thanks to timely action by
Deputy President Christine
Teller.
The Refectory Committee
planned to pass on a two pence
per pint price increase from the
brewers directly to students, as
has long been their policy,
regardless of the financial
position of the bars.
A well informed source
reported that Victor Mooney,
refectory manager, whose loss-
making operations are subsidised
by the bars, was a supporter of
the planned increase.
However, Miss Teller argued
that discounts obtained last year
had not been passed on, and that
the bar accounts were in such a
mess that the financial necessity
of the increases could not be
proved. She insisted on a full
review of bar financing before
increases were introduced and a
review of the policy of
automatically passing on
increases.
London Student
Election Fiddle
Allegations of electoral
malpractice have resulted from
the re-opening of the nomina-
tions for the post of editor of the
'London Student' newspaper.
The U L U Vice-President, Kim
White, mistakenly closed the
nominations a day early with
only one candidate having been
nominated. When the error was
realised the election of this
candidate was declared invalid
and nominations re-opened
allowing 'London Student' hacks
who had missed the original date
to get their names put forward.
The single candidate orginally
nominated Michael George of
Kings College, described the
events as a left-wing manoeuvre
to prevent the election of an
editor who represented the views
of London students.
March Keeps Going
Till December
The Rector of the Royal College
of Art, Lionel March, is still
clinging to his post despite his
resignation in July. It was thought
that his successor would be
appointed quickly and that he
would then step down, but the
College has been dragging its feet
in interviewing potential
candidates and there are now
moves to reinstate him.
The RCA is presently a hot bed
of controversy and dissent, not
least over the Albert Exhibition
which is losing money heavily.
But the deep-rooted problem is
the professional power blocks
who make the college almost
ungovernable since they are able
to do pretty much as they like
including, it is rumoured, a lot of
private work in college time. The
result of this is that the RCA has
attracted attention from the DES
resulting in larger cuts than might
otherwise have been expected.
CND Shocker
Ruddock Romps Home
One of the Debating Society's
major meetings of this session
took place on Tuesday evening
when Peregrine Worsthorne,
Associate Editor of the Sunday
Telegraph and Joan Ruddock,
CND Chairman, were the main
speakers for and against the
motion tha) 'CND undermines
our deterrent and thereby
threatens the peace and defence
of this country'.
Mech Eng 220 was only half
full as Mr. Worsthorne professed
the belief that although CND's
proposals were admirable, they
were dangerous to the security of
N A T O and B r i t a i n . Mrs
Ruddock opened by remarking
how little had changed since she
was at IC, including FELIX's
inaccurate reporting, then went
on to condemn the arms race
and defend CND's role in trying
to end it. The motion was
defeated by 78 votes to 27.
New Phones for Old
Continued from front page
users will mourn the passing of
many of the antique phones
littered about college, as a
quarter of the present phones are
due to be replaced. All phones
will be able to receive outside
calls, and selected extensions will
be able to dial out without
having to go through the ex-
change staff as at present.
With the introduction of the
new exchange, the amount spent
by individual users can be
monitored. The method of
payment will have to be chan-
ged. Instead of the present
flat rate per phone system
imposed on individual depart-
ments, each department will now
be responsinble for its own
phone bill. This decentralisation
of responsibility will mean that
the decision on whether to
continue the present ban on
morning calls will be made by
individual departments. There
was some confusion as to
whether the the Union would
have to pay for its own phone
calls like departments, but it will
be easy for college to find out
how much is being spent on
Union calls.
What is happening to the
extension numbers is still
uncertain, but it is likely that
there will be much confusion as
people get usd to the new single
phone system.
Club
Grounded
The Hang Gliding Club has had a
once in a lifetime opportunity
turned down by the Union
Finance Committee. The club
were offered an almost new
microlite engine for Â£600, half the
usual price. They needed extra
money from UFC so that they
could still purchase a hang glider
later this year as planned, but
now they will almost certainly be
unable to do this.
It was noted by some observers
that the sum requested by the
club was identical to the amount
being spent on a weekend holiday
for three Union hacks in
Blackpool (see last week's
FELIX).
Fremantle
Rumours
Students living at the Fremantle
Hotel, a college head tenancy,
have been told by one of the
subwardens that the warden,
Andrew Walker, is about to be
sacked. However, all official
sources refuse to confirm or deny
the story, with the Union and the
Student Services Office both
refusing to make any comment.
It seems that the prolonged
controversy surrounding the
condition of the Fremantle and
the mistakes made during the
summer letting scheme, and the
treatment in FELIX of these
matters, is at last coming to a
head. FELIX will have further
details next week.
