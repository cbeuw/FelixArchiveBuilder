PHEW!
WHAT A
PHONE
BILL
Surprised Union officials reacted
strongly to the news that in future
Union phone calls may have to be
paid for from the Union Subvention
from college.
This is just one of the many
possible changes caused by the
replacement of the present dual
telephone network (separate
internal and external phones)
with a new computerized single
phone system.
The old outdated telephone
network has been under review
since 1976, but due to the cost of
replacement, then estimated at
over one and a quarter million
pounds, the plan was shelved.
Since then the price has dropped
to three quarters of a million
pounds. British Telecom has
now been contracted to supply
Imperial College with the new
system by the start of next
session.
Work is starting in February,
but no disruption to the present
system is anticipated until
August, as the new network will
be developed in parallel, leaving
final connections until the last
moment. College expects to save
at least £50,000 a year through
lower running costs, and despite
the need to lose over half the
staff running the present switch-
board, assurances have been
given that no redundancy
notices will be served.
The new exchange, while not
presenting anything particularly
new in exchange technology
nevertheless represents a major
step forward for Imperial
College. The new system will be
able to carry data from word
processors and computers, a
facility unavailable on the
present network. Internal phone

T E A ' S U P !
There was an overwhelming
response to the call for a Bot Zoo
tea-in yesterday morning. About
three hundred and fifty people
turned up to show their support for
the reopening of the tea-room,
which has been shut since April.
Professor Wood, Life Sciences
Head of Department, was
unable to attend, but sent a letter
expressing his regrets, for being
absent, and offered to see a
delegation next week.
Tim Wilson, Life Sci. Dep.
Rep., hoped that this demonstr-
tion would make Professor
Wood think again about finding
money for the tea-room. He was
however doubtful about getting
the tea-room opened for both
morning and afternoon tea, but
hoped to see limited opening in a
few weeks time.
The sticking point seems to be
Professor Wood's insistance that
the tea-room be self financing.
Mr. Ian French who used to
organise the tea-room, felt that
this would make the tea-room
unworkable in its previous
informal and relaxed manner. A
Hordes of thirsty
qualified person would be
needed to keep the books and
audit the accounts.
The closure of the tea-room
has left a social vacuum in the
department. Previously up to
250 students and lecturers were
able to relax between lectures
drinkers at the 'Tea-in'
there in a friendly environment.
Peter Burt organiser of the
protest would like to thank the
kitchen staff, and all those who
make this event possible, raising
£30 for Rag, and opening the
door for further negotiations.
Estates Slated in Tiles Fiasco
The College has been loaned
£770,000 by the UGC to carry out
long overdue repairs to the tiles on
the exterior of the Electrical
Engineering Building. The addit-
ional scaffolding which was
erected three months ago is
expected to remain at least until
May whilst loose tiles are removed
and new cladding sheets are
installed.
It became apparent more than
six years ago, shortly after the
building was put up, that all was
not well with the tiles. Several
came loose and some even fell
off, so protective shields were
erected in 1977 to prevent tiles
hitting people on the head. The
College has been involved in a
legal action against the builders
since the problem became
apparent, and final judgement is
not expected for another year at
least. The College needs to have
the work carried out in order to
know the cost of the repair
which it then hopes to recover
from the builders through the
courts. The UGC has agreed to a
special loan to pay for most of
the necessary work in the first
place.
The question remains as to
why the College have waited
until now to start the work. It
was widely thought that they
were waiting for the legal action
to be completed first, but it now
appears that the legal action
cannot be completed until after
the work has been carried out. In
the meantime there has been the
annual cost of hiring the protect-
ive scaffolding for six years, and
the presence of an ugly eye-sore
in the middle of College.
The reasons for the delay are
unclear, but reasons offered such
as that deterioration has only
recently made the work necess-
ary, or that the delay is due to
Council planning hold-ups left
experienced observers of the
college administration uncon-
vinced.
