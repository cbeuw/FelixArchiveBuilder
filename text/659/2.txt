Storm in
a Teacup
Dear Pallab
With reference to the
continuing saga of the Bot/Zoo
tea room, why is the Biology
department expected to
subsidise what has always been
a facility used by people from
all departments? Surely the
Union should be responsible for
running the service in what is
after all a Union room.
Students at Imperial are
beiijjg trained in technological
skills vital to the future of Brit-
ish industry. If our so-called
leaders cannot manage to run a
tea bar between them what
.hope is there for British
; industry? If they do not feel up
to this onerous task then they
should resign.
Yours sincerely
J Martin Taylor
One President
to Another
Dear Pallab
I have just been reading
Gaynor's letter of 8/11/83 on
Nicaragua, and I think it's
actually quite good. What
worries me much more is the
use of the word 'literally' in that
week's issue of FELIX. If one of
my PR men did that I would
literally chop his balls off. I
think that what Mr Peter
Rodgers must have meant to
say was 'unilaterally wiped the
floor with the speakers'.
Yours very very sincerely

Taken
'Literally'
I am writing concerning the
article appearing in your
magazine of 1
1 November. It
appears that students of
Imperial College are quite
blatantly coming j n t 0 my
premises and are using the word
'literally' with neither prior
consultation of my staff, nor
returning the word after its use.
I would point out that
Sainsburys has a very limited
supply of this word and if
people do not discontinue using
it immediately. I shall be forced
to take immediate legal action
against offencers.
Yours irately
(and literally)

RefectoryBoycott
Dear Sir

since no one else is organising a
refectory boycott, / shall be
boycotting the refectory myself
from Monday 28 November.

Dear Pallab
I have long known that there
are some real wallys at IC, but
Neil Martin's letter of two weeks
ago really scaled heights of
inanity! I am, of course,
referring to his assertation that
the Government has "already
made the decision to shoot the
unarmed Geenham Peace
Women if they get in the way".
The truth of this matter is
that, in an attempt to
manufacture controversy, a
Labour MP asked the Defence
Secretary to give an assurance
that no so-called 'Peace
Women' would be shot if they
penetrated the secure zones
within the Greenham base, a
statement that he knew Mr
Heseltine could not make. The
question was quite disin-
genuous, since the challenger
was well aware of ihe,strict rules
of engagement followed by the
soldiers guarding all Military
installations (rules which this
government has not changed)
rules which, indeed, were in
force under the last Labour
Government. Perhaps they
were Fascists too!
Yours scathingly
Herr Richard Monkhouse
Blatant Untruths
Dear Pallab
It just makes me wonder to
the credibility of FELIX when
it prints letters which contain
blatant untruths. I refer of
course to last week's letter from
Alison B Mew extolling the
virtues of RSMU.
How she claims to be 'setting
the records straight' is certainly
a travesty, and all that follows
amounts to propaganda.
Although she claims to be a*
member of RSMU she seems far
removed from the reality of that
union.
Anyone who has read RSMU's
own publication following the
last UGM will see the absurdity
of her claims. In an article
entitled 'Hon Porn Night' the
mines block vote is recognised
and actively promoted.
The voting at the UGMs was
handled rather ineptly. This has
been used in argument against
the validity of the result, but
what must be remembered is the
way in which the mass exodus
(and subsequent return) of
miners was responsible for this
degeneration of order.
The final outcome, however,
shows a certain credibility, as it
correlates well with the voting
on the amendment (both in the
margin and the number of votes
cast).
The porn motion was passed
by members to whom this issue
is of direct concern and who
care for their Union's
credibility. All these people are
extremely fed up with Ms Mew
and her like in R S M U
perpetuating the image they
think Imperial College Union
should have. The result of the
voting speaks for itself!
