RAG WEEK REVIEWED
THE AWFUL TRUTH REVEALED
Friday
The most ambitious Rag stunt of
the week was the 'Drink a Bar
Dry' event a daunting task which
even Imperial College, with its
large numbers of latent
homosexual beer swilling louts,
could not achieve. Even after 250
people had downed over 2,000
pints at the Great British Beer
Factory on Brompton Road two
putnps remained open.
Saturday
Saturday saw the 24hr street
collection and Silly Sports rag
stunt. A record total of £1,750
was collected despite some sore
heads from the previous night.
Hon Sec Sean Davis narrowly
missed being arrest whilst
collecting drunk in Leicester
Square, out of the area covered
by the licence.
Another record profit was
made that night when 200 people
attended SCAB light and raised a
total of £300. The highlight was
Dramsoc's piss-take of an
amateur operatic society which
directly followed Opsoc's
highlights from HMS Pinafare.
Sunday
Sunday proved a day of daring
and downright silliness. Despite
the bitter cold all three CCU
Execs paddled or in Mines case,
swam, across the Serpentine on
rafts disguised as bundles of
rubbish. City and Guilds won for
the first time in five years but
wree heavily defeated by RCS in
the ensuing tug of war. That
evening a fireworks display was
held in Beit Quad followed by an
ICU Bar Night in the Union Bar.
The following morning the ever
drunk Hon Sec Sean Davis went
for a bath and promptly fell
asleep, waking up in cold water
two hours later.
Tuesday
The Mines Dirty Disco on
Tuesday saw the Exec come
out of their closets. Sean Davis
appeared in a black dress, one of
the more slinky little numbers

from his wardrobe, but star of the
evening was Gaynor Lewis
attired in just an airforce jacket
and suspender belt. (What, no
knickers?-Ed).
Wednesday
On Wednesday the threeCCUs
competed with each other to win
some of the several prizes
offered by selling the most Rag
Mags in the Inter-College Rag
Mag Selling event. Most of the
London Colleges had given their
permission for 1C students to
invade their campuses with
copies of Carl Burgess' highly
original and downright dis-
gusting Rag Mag.
Thursday
Despite all the alcoholic Rag
events earlier in the week, a
number of students still managed
to make the Monster Boat Race
event where the three CCUs race
to finish off their allocation of
pints. The event was won as
usual by Mines Union, with
Guilds second and RCS third.
The Guilds' Custard Pie Men
have been busy all week. FELIX
Editor Pallab Ghosh was woken
on Wednesday morning and
promptly custard pied five or six
times in the first flanning of Rag
Week. Today is your final chance
to ensure all your favourite
people get their just
people get their just desserts—
orders can be placed in the Guilds
Office.
All-in-all this year's Rag Week
has been the most successful for
many years, with the biggest and
best event still to come tonight.
