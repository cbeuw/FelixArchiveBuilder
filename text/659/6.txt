FREE NHS PRESCRIPTIONS, DENTAL
TREATMENT AND GLASSES.
Although students are not auto-
matically entitled to free pre-
scriptions, dental treatment and
glasses, most students can get
them free on the grounds of low
income.
During Term Time
Eligibility to these benefits is
based on your weekly income.
There are two ways in which the
DHSS can treat the student grant
for these purposes, with the latter
being the most common and the
most likely to afford eligibility.
The first is to deduct the
vacation, travel and books and
equipment elements from the
grant and then divide the remain-
ing amount by 30 weeks to get a
term time figure. The second is
simply to assume the basic grant
to be roughly equal to the single
person's rate of supplementary
benefit. People receiving supple-
mentary benefit have what is
known as an 'automatic right' to
free prescriptions, dental treat-
ment and glasses, so unless the
student has any additional in-
come such as a scholarship which
takes their income above the
supplementary benefit level, they
will be eligible to reclaim charges.
Fortunately, individual stu-
dents need not worry about
these calculations as questions
concerning your weekly income
on the claim forms for these
benefits can be sufficiently an-
swered by stating that you are a
full-time student living on a
studen; grant. Any additional
income should be declared and in
the case of scholarships you
should make it clear how many
weeks the money is supposed to
cover so that the DHSS can
calculate your income properly.
However, to quote one DHSS
official to whom I spoke recently
"We don't usually take much
notice of what's on the form, we
just pay them."
Falling ill can not only be miserable but expensive
too. Karen Stott, Student Services Officer,
attempts to ease the pecuniary agony by writing
about the tricks of the trade in the ill health game.
During Vacations
During the short vacations the
position is much the same as in
term time except that in the case
of undergraduates the weekly
income figure is lower, thereby
possibly extending eligibility to
some whose incomes may be too
high in term time. As there is no
element in the undergraduate
grant to cover the summer
vacation those who do not find
vacation work are eligible to sign
on for supplementary benefit. As
mentioned above this will give
you the 'automatic right' to free
prescriptions, dental treatment
and glasses. If you have the
'automatic right' simply tell your
dentist or optician and ask them
to arrange the forms for you. For
prescription charges, get a receipt
when you pay the charge and take
it to your local DHSS who will
give you a refund.
Capital
There is a capital limit of £2,500
on these benefits so you will not
be eligible for any refund if your
savings and other capital exceed
this figure.
Prescriptions
Prescriptions now cost £1.40 per
item so it is worth investigating
your entitlement. Don't wait
until you need a prescription, get
form PI 1 now and apply for an
exemption certificate. If you are
successful in getting a prescrip-
tion exemption certificate on the
grounds of low income, this will
give you the 'automatic right' to
free dental treatment and glasses.
One of the main difficulties here
is the length of time taken by the
DHSS to assess your claim. It is
therefore quite likely that you
may need a prescription before
you received your exemption
certificate, In this case get a
receipt when you pay the charge
and send the receipt with a
covering letter to the DHSS
office dealing with your PI 1.
If your claim is refused and you
think you may need a large
number of items on prescription
over the next few months then it
may be worth getting a pre-
payment certificate. These cost
£7.50 for four months and £21.50
for a year and they cover any
number of prescriptions needed
in that period. To apply get form
FP95 from your local chemist,
post office or DHSS.
Dental Treatment
Dental charges can only be
claimed back for treatment avail-
able under the National Health
Service. No help is available for
private treatment. The Student
Services Office and the Health
Centre have lists of dentists
willing to provide NHS treatment
to students, but it 'is always
advisable to check with the
dentist that the work s/he intends
to do can be covered under the
NHS or you could end up facing a
substantial bill.
Some dentists will arrange the
reimbursement of costs for you,
most will expect you to pay the
charge yourself and claim it back.
Ask the dentist for form FID, fill
it in and send it with a receipt for
the charge to your nearest DHSS
office.
For those not eligible the most
you should have to pay for a
course of routine dental treat-
ment under the NHS eg fillings, is
£13.50 and for a course of non-
routine treatment (including

£95.
Glasses
As with dental charges free
optical treatment can only be
claimed for work available under
the NHS. This includes NHS
glasses (frames and lenses) but
not contact lenses. There are six*
types of frames available under
the NHS however, reirpburse-
ment is limited to the cost of the
cheapest frame. If you choose
one of the more expensive frames
you will have to make up the
difference between the cheapest
frame and your choice. Sight-
tests are free to anyone but you
must tell the optician you want a
NHS not a private test.
Check with the optician before
you start that any intended work
can be covered under the NHS.
As with dental charges you wil
have to pay first and claim back
later. Ask the optician for form
Fl and collect form F6 from the
DHSS. Fill them in and send
them both to your nearest DHSS.
If you are not eligible for help
with optical charges the most you
will have to pay per lens under the
NHS is £8.95 for a single vision
lens and £15.50 for a bifocal lens.
NHS frames range from £2.05 to
£13.05.
Students with Families
If you're supporting a family on a
student grant it is essential that
you know your free entitlements.

More Information?
Leaflets Pll for prescriptions,
D l l for dental treatment, G i l
for glasses and MV11 for milk
and vitamins are available from
the Student Services Office,
Health Centre, your local DHSS
and most central Post Offices.
These leaflets explain more fully
what you can claim and in the
case of the Pll and MV11
contain the necessary forms for
you to complete and send off.
Remember it is easier to apply
for a prescription exemption
certificate now than it is to try
and claim back prescription
charges once you've paid them.
Also a prescription exemption
certificate gives you the 'auto-
matic right' to free dental treat-
ment and glasses and saves claim
ing for each visit you make.
If you have any queries or
problems with your claim, call
into the Student Services Office,
15 Princes Gardens, any weekday
between 9:30am and 5:30pm
