P r o p s a l s for devastating
increases i n tuition fees for
1977 were announced by Mrs
Shirley W i l l i a m s , Education
Secretary, i n the Commons last
Thursday (25 Nov). T h e new
proposals modify those made
last J u l y by F r e d Mulley,
benefiting some home students
but adding to the fees of
overseas students.
.Originally the D E S advocated
increases i n fees from £182—
£650 for university first
degrees and £416-£750 f o r
postgraduates. However Mrs
Williams s a i d she h a d been
persuaded this would c a u s e
' e x c e s s i v e d i f f i c u l t i e s ' for
Universities and c o l l e g e s a n d
self supporting students —
therefore the fees for home
students would be £500.
But she s a w no necessity
in reducing fees for overseas
undegraduates particularly
bearing in mind the fall i n the
pound. A l l postgraduates are
subject to m a s s i v e increases
- £750 for home and £850
for overseas students. Some
of the worst hit w i l l be the
two thousand home postgrad-
uates who are self-supporting.
F e a r s are growing that
these increases w i l l result i n
closures both of university
research departments a n d
further education c o l l e g e s ,
because of falling student
numbers. B y increasing fees
the Government may w e l l be
denying the p o s s i b i l i t y of
further education of financially
poorer students. A l o n g s i d e the
recent proposals drawn up for
closures of further education
c o l l e g e s it would appear that
the Labour Government has
(temporarily at least) aband-
oned its s o c i a l i s t principles
of freely a v a i l a b l e education.
E v e n before the increases
were announced, Governors
of several London C o l l e g e s ,
including Bedford a n d Queen
Mary had written to Mrs
Williams opposing any i n -
c r e a s e s , and i n h i s annual
speech to the Union C o u n c i l ,
the Rector, S i r B r i a n F l o w e r s
a l s o deplored the proposals.

73% of university a n d
c o l e g e students do not have
their grants fully made up by
their parents, according to
D E S figures, published this
month. Students are forced to
rely o n vacation earnings,
averaging £167 p a , and even
this does not cover the £250
deficit of some students. Mr
O a k e s , Minister of E d u c a t i o n
expressed concern.

£100,000 less for Rents
£100,000 i s being witheld
by Loughborough students in
the biggest U K rent strike o n
record. 850 students have put
their residence fees into a
fund s e t up by a rent strike
committee.
Students want hall f ees
reduced s o that they are i n the
same proportion to the grant
as they were last year. That
means reducing the £170 for
full board and lodging to £158
a term with a similar reduction
for self-catering students. The
Committee i s a l s o demanding
more student involvement i n
the formulation o f residence
fees.
The rent strike was e s c a l -

U n i v e r s i t y authorities persuad-
ed people to pay their greatly
inflated hall fees a s they
c o l l e c t e d their grant c h e c k s ,
before receiving their b i l l s . A
mass meeting of University
residents was c a l l e d and over
300 people voted overwhelm-
ingly to go on a rent strike
and to s e t up a 'rent fund'. A
Union General Meeting voted
unanimously to support the
residents d e c i s i o n , indicating
that the C o l l e g e s i n Lough-
