Inconsiderate
societies
Dear S i r , — I am sorry if this
article consumes a precious
page of your already stuffed
magazine. B u t I find t h i s
paper a suitable mouthpiece
to express some o p i n i o n s ,
w h i c h I think need immediate
attention.
Every year, when the
C o l l e g e re-opens in October,
we w i t n e s s many functions,
exhibitions, e t c N e w students
become aware of various
s o c i e t i e s e x i s t i n g in this
c o l l e g e The organisers of the
many s o c i e t i e s show much
interest in e n r o l l i n g new
members; but how many of
them take the care of letting
their new friends know about
the s o c i e t i e s ' forthcoming
e v e n t s , so that the latter may
participate?
Of course, one c a n see
posters hung up here and
there; but these are few and
far between* Is it not p o s s i b l e
to send individual invitations
to every member in his
department; after a l l it costs
nothing? T h e Indian Society
is one, w h i c h doesn't care to
notify its new members of
their a c t i v i t i e s . Such organis-
ations should cease to e x i s t .
My second request is for a
common room for a l l P o s t -
Graduate students where they
can watch the T V or read
newspapers^ both from home
and abroad, while having their
lunch or enjoying d r i n k s . Of
course, the Haldane L i b r a r y
keeps newspapers, but then
we c a n ' t eat food there. I w i s h
the respective authorities
would be kind enough to
consider this.
F i n a l l y , I would l i k e to
mention something about the
exorbitant tuition fees to be
imposed upon the overseas
students from next year. Will
not it affect the international
nature of this world famous
C o l l e g e ? We a l l know that one-
third of the students are from
overseas. I hope IC U n i o n w i l l
not remain a p a s s i v e spectator.

needed for
Dear Sir, - On Sunday the 21st
of November w h i l s t attending
the " S C A B E v e n i n g " - a
suitable name for what wa« to
ensue — it was my misfortune
to w i t n e s s the most revolting
d i s p l a y of perverse, not to
mention warped, sexual
a c t i v i t i e s it has ever been
my misfortune to c r o s s paths
with. I am of course referring
to the organised 'Blue Movie'
showing which was part of the
above mentioned evening,,
I am unaware as to what
extent the Union may interject
into organised showings of
this type, but a case clearly
e x i s t s for the censorship
by some neutral body of s u c h
depraved filth. Commonsense
on the part of the organisers,
coupled with a modest amount
of responsibility and a modicum
of good taste, would have
made censorship obsolete.
None of these q u a l i t i e s was
evident, so I consider it a
necessary and prudent step to
rid the C o l l e g e of any future
threat of obscene showings.
T h i s aim should be strived for
with a fabian z e s t !
I am aware that the def in it ion
of obscene varies greatly from
person to person, but under no
circumstances would I concede
that S C A B ' S blue movies
served a useful purpose to this
c o l l e g e , except to corrupt the
minds of the supposedly
intelligent students here. I
v i e w beastiality and mastur-
bating — these were e x p l i c i t l y
shown — w i t h the utmost
contempt.
I conclude by stating that
i n retrospect I f e e l hard done
by at paying 25p to be present
at s u c h a degenerate d e b a c l e .
The money may be going to a
good cause but a means t o
an end doesn't transform
into right.

Prophetic Felix?
Sir, - Is F E L I X prophetic, or
am I c o n f u s i n g c a u s e a n d
effect? I am referring to the
apparently c o n t r o v e r s i a l
C o l l e g e i s s u e s you keep
r a i s i n g ; for example the latest
one being the rejections of the
Linsteatt extension p l a n s .
U n l e s s we c a n mobilise
our friends, the student body
and other members of I C , it
seems p o i n t l e s s to protest
at • the p l a n ' s rejection. A l l
Students with whom I have
instigated a d i s c u s s i o n ' on
this topic either believe' it to
be no c o n c e r n of theirs or
f e e l .that they are powerless
to do anything.
the same we must remember
that the benefits of new h a l l s
w i l l be future students, a b l e
to work in reasonable
accommodation, at a fair rent,
c l o s e to C o l l e g e .
Perhaps P r o f e s s o r Wiggins'
blocks c o u l d be rearranged
around the s i d e s of a square
to give a decent, better l i t
area with tennis courts and
car parking space in the open
part of the square. So a c h i e v -
ing high student numbers and
fresh air and light for everyone.
Yours faithfully
