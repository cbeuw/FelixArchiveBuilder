NEWSPAPER O f IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
The chance for everyone to vote
on our continued membership of M S
i s to be welcomed. UGM's have come
to be regarded a s farcial a s far a s
representation goes; a college-wide
ballot decision i s the only true way to
judge opinion.
The move, on Monday, to ensure
that the A P i s not reliant on funds
directly from C o l l e g e i s , I b e l i e v e ,
the right step. The A P should present
the student view and feel able to
put this across forcefully, without
having to seek C o l l e g e approval. L e t
us hope that this year the A P becomes
a true alternative.

eager to regain their lost
mascot, Izzy — a s i x foot high

The first signs of this
were when G u i l d s a r c h i v i s t

By this time the van h a d
been loaded, locked, but not
driven away. T h e P o l i c e

taken from the Guilds store-

had been p i c k e d ,
A different method w a s
used to search the. Union
building for Izzy t h e same
night; the Union believes that
a C o l l e g e master key w a s used
to open the locks here. T h e
search w a s first discovered
when the D P noticed many

T h i s i s not the only occurence
of this type o f incident
recently.
