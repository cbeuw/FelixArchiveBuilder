Congratulations on s t i l l actually being
with yourself somewhere within your
brain c a v i t y .
G o d , what a R a g Week! I'm exhausted!
However, I do have one teensy weensy
little complaint and that i s that Morphy
Day just wasn't dirty enough. There w a s ,
nevertheless, the consolation of n o t
only getting into Harrods unharrased, but
also being served on the fourth.floor (!)
restaurant — the perfumery department
w i l l never be the same a g a i n .

LIES

IC Union Hon.Sec.
I hope you a l l enjoyed yourselves; my
p i c k l e d brain i s s t i l l bubbling away to
rythmic pleas of " w h e n c a n I have some
s l e e p ? "
Notwithstanding a l l this, back to
reality and —
Student Residence Officer a
n
d
Hon Junior Treasurer.
At the moment two major areas of
concerji to us a l l , namely Accommodation
and F i n a n c i a l Control of Union R e s o u r c e s ,
are i n desperate need of some form of
permanent overseeing.
The former post, that of Student
R e s i d e n c e Officer, i s concerned directly
with accommodation matters. H e i s
chairman of the IC Union Accommodation
Committee, and sits on the Union F i n a n c e
Committee, and the Union Welfare
Committee. F o r h i s sins he a l s o sits o n
the following College Committees:- the
Student H a l l s Committee and the Student
H o u s e s Committee. A s p a n be s e e n , the
post does entail a fair amount o f
committee work but nevertheless most
of the work i s done at grass root level ie
dealing with people.
The latter post, that of H o n Junior
Treasurer, i s a post not i n direct control
of the overall financial picture of the
Union — this control i s vested with
the Union F i n a n c e Committee a n d
implemented by the Hon Senior Treasuer,
Dr K e n Weale (who is a wonderful person,
a really great guy and please sign that
cheque for my Christmas break in the
S e y c h e l l e s , K e n ! ? ) . K e n would currently
like to know where h i s Junior Treasurer
a c t u p ' l " i s '
The j o b generally entails a s s i s t i n g
the I C U Senior Treasurer i n many ways
and, more s p e c i f i c a l l y , keeping a
watchful e y e over the expenditure of
Union Committees, co-ordinating the
preparation of the annual Union estimates
for submission to the C o l l e g e , maintain-
ing the inventory of Union equipment,
c o l l e c t i n g and banking of money, and the
committee work too (only Union F i n a n c e
Committee i n h i s c a s e ) .
If anyone is interested i n either o f
these posts (please note that despite
my phraseology, you don't have to be a
" h e " to take up either post) then p l e a s e ,
please contact me as soon as p o s s i b l e .
NUS Discount Cards
T h i s scheme has not been involved
in the current crash of N U S T r a v e l a n d
is s t i l l functioning. The second batch of
cards have in fact arrived. F o r a l l those
lovely people down at Silwood (I know
you're there but you s t i l l haven't sent me
a postcard) I have sent y o u down a
conseignment of Discount Cards a n d
these are a v a i l a b l e from your Committee
( I C U S P C ) . See John Mumford (Chairman)
or Martin H a l l (Hon Secretary) for d e t a i l s .
NUS and its Service Companies
Alter the N U S Executive d e c i s i o n
the current state of affairs i s :
(i) N U S Travel L t d has c e a s e d trading
and is being wound u p .
(ii) E n d s l e i g h P r i n t i n g Services ( U n i -
print) h a s c e a s e d trading and i s being
wound up.
(iii) Soate a n d B l a c k w e l l L t d (Photc-
mech) has gone into liquidation.
(iv) E n d s l e i g h Marketing L t d ( N U S
Marketing i s continuing trading.
(v) E n d s l e i g h Insurances (Brokers) L t d
is continuing trading.
Matters w h i c h would seem to be l i k e l y
to be of direct relevance to IC students
w i l l , I hope, be covered by the following:
(a) If you have booked with N U S T r a v e l ,
they w i l l try a n d get y o u out on the
same scheduling but may not be able to
do s o . Should you not wish to travel by
the new scheduling y o u c a n c l a i m a
refund.
(b) N U S Marketing — calculators,
sleeping bags, etc are s t i l l going, as
(iv) states, however in a main mail from
N U S it s a y s : ' / f is our belief that it was
too early to a s s e s s the current viability
of Marketing, and therefore that it should
continue as normal." T h e decision over
this must therefore by yours. T h e forms
for Marketing are s t i l l available i n ' t h e

(c) E n d s l e i g h Insurance i s s t i l l v a l i d

T h a t ' s a l l for now, take care and s e e
you around.
Over the last two years, if not for a
much longer period, I C Union has been
looking very critically at its o w n
structure. 18 months a g o the (Working
Party on Union R e s o u r c e s ' , chaired by
Gordon J a c k s o n , proposed the creation
of a new sabbatical post, replacing the
present Deputy President. T h e new
officer would be chairman of both House
and F i n a n c e committees.
Then last year we s a w the 'Working
Party on Union Response % T h i s looked
c r i t i c a l l y at the present committee
structure, and rejected the i d e a of
enlarging Union C o u n c i l to form a
'Student Representative C o u n c i l ' a s
advocated by Pete Teague.
T h i s year we have the new Permanent
Working P a r t y , a revamped F l o o r R e p s
committee, which is looking further a t
the Constitution and Structure of the Union.
That structure has evolved over half
a century, but the form summarised in
the diagram below has remained almost
unchanged since the late 1960's, the days
of P i e r s Corbyn, and of the referendum
on Union Structure, which decided to
affiliate to N U S and not to disband
the C C U s .
So here's a quick rundown, a s one
hack sees it of the present arrangement.
The sovereign body is the Union Geneial
Meeting, at which a l l F u l l (ie current
student) members may vote, a n d L i f e
members may speak but not vote. It
decides a l l major policy matters, in
particular our p o l i c i e s o n external
affairs, residence and refectory p o l i c y .
The format, for those of you w h o
have never attended (slap your w r i s t s ,
you naughty people) is E x e c u t i v e
reports, e l e c t i o n s , motions, a n d any
other b u s i n e s s . If y o u want to complain
about F e l i x (say), or Refectory p r i c e s ,
or the reduction in cleaning i n h a l l s , dr
or to c a l l for my resignation for w r i t i n g
such drivel i n F e l i x , —(Verbal Diarrhoea
- T y p i s t ) — t h e n this is the forum in which
to do it.
The execution of these d e c i s i o n s i s
then up to (I) the President, who may
delegate matters to other members of
ORANGE

Everett
IC Union
Deputy President
the Executive: and/or (ii) Council, i n
particular regarding the financial
implications of the decision.. C o u n c i l
may only refer a matter back to a U G M
once, and is analagons to the House o f
Lords in this respect. U s u a l l y C o u n c i l
w i l l refer matters for further debate to
one of its sub-committees.
If the decision of U G M or of C o u n c i l
affects the use of Union rooms, e g
organising a conference or a jumble
sale or whatever, arrangements are
d i s c u s s e d by House Committee.
T h i s committee a l s o d i s c u s s e s the
redecoration and furnishing of the
Union areas, the booking of rooms a n d
the allocation of rooms and equipment
for maximum e f f i c i e n c y . B y its very
nature it controls a large chunk, (on
average about 8%) of the Union's
income.
More generally. C o u n c i l may refer
matters for fuller d i s c u s s i o n to (i) the
Permanent Working Party, ( i i ) the
E x e c u t i v e Committee, or ( i i i ) an ad
hoc Working Party.
Various sectional interests are
represented on C o u n c i l by the chairmen
of the four (perhaps soon to be s i x )
major sub-committees, the President of
ICWA, the chairman of the Postgraduate
Group and the Academic Affairs Officers
of the C C U s . T h e dept reps a l s o
represent, to some extent, C C U interests
on C o u n c i l , a s do the P r e s i d e n t s of
C C U s . T h e latter comprise half of the
E x e c u t i v e Committee.
Between them the chairman of the
jiiajor subcommittees reprent about 100
S o c i e t i e s , the part of the Union w i t h
which most readers w i l l be most familiar.
It would be impossible for one person
to co-ordinate the running of a l l these
s o c i e t i e s , although other large Unions
have created a sabbatical post for this
purpose.

major subcommittees by means of the
