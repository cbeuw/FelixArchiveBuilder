IG contain airborne medics
IC 1st XI 1 v London Hospital 1st XI 1
London H o s p i t a l , fielding
half a dozen strapping s i x
footers, proved stiff opposition
for this lightweight but
tenacious I C s i d e .
The medics arrived at
Harlington with a w e l l earned
reputation of being one of the
more robust and effective
college sides in L o n d o n . So
it was with some apprehension
but a large measure of resolve
that our lads went out onto
the f i e l d .
I C — notoriously slow
starters — weathered the early
storm where London exploited
their aerial superiority with a
series of high curling c r o s s e s
into the • box. But for the
bravery of Brabbin a n d the
effective love of Huntingdon
IC may w e l l not have survived
this early onslaught.
Survive it they d i d however,
and slowly gathering composure,
began with some deft inter-
changes to set up their o w n
attacks. A brief s k i r m i s h o n
the edge of the L o n d o n area
involving Bates and Baker s a w
the older m a n , with t y p i c a l
nonchalance, slot the b a l l in
the net. A n unexpected w i n d -
f a l l for a hitherto bewildered
I C s i d e .
The second half s a w the
game develop into a fast
exciting struggle for dominance,
with IC growing in stature with
every minute. In midfield the
blond, elegant captain of I C ,
Grimwade, contended the
rights with a l l the verve a n d
mastery of a n a c c o m p l i s h e d
star. A d d to this the dogged
determination of h i s midfield
support and the persistence
of L i n d o n a n d Frampton up
front and it is not difficult to
see why I C — i n terms of team
work a t least — emerged
slightly the better s i d e .
In terms of goals however,
London H o s p i t a l came off
winners i n the 2nd half with
an inevitable header. A
lapse o n the part of the I C
defense was punished severely
almost c l i n i c a l l y , with a
remarkable example of how to
head the b a l l . A n d s o the
game ended i n a stalemate.
T h e game proved to be a n
interesting forerunner for the
forthcoming c u p c l a s h between
the two c l u b s o n Saturday,
IC at least c a n draw some
small comfort from the
encounter. T h e forte of their
opponents l i e s , s o to speak,
in the a i r . If I C c a n stifle
this undoubted talent then
they w i l l be half w a y to
regaining the coveted trophy
w h i c h , incidentally, w a s last
in our p o s s e s s i o n during the
halcyon days of Smith & C o ,
in '72 - ' 73.
Team:- K Allen, C Howley, I
Huntingdon, D Brabbin, R

Flying start
The G l i d i n g C l u b has had a
very s u c c e s s f u l term s o f a r ,
with about 2 0 new members
progressing with their training,
some of them nearing s o l o
standard. F o r these people we
w i l l be organising a c o u r s e
during the Christmas v a c a t i o n ,
which weather permitting,
w i l l produce the first crop of
s o l o pilots for this s e s s i o n .
A group of ex-student mem-
bers of the c l u b have just been
on a very s u c c e s s f u l trip to
Scotland, one of them climbing
to over 20,000 feet in l e e -
waves off the Scottish
mountains.
We have at last taken
delivery of our new high
performance glass-fibre glider
and work i s progressing
rapidly to get it flying as soon
as p o s s i b l e .
If anybody wants to join or
simply to find out more about
the c l u b , please come along to
one of our meetings i n A e r o

5.30pm.

performance
IC 2 v Bank of England 2
The game started quite
w e l l for I C , w h o managed t o
absorbe the pressure that
Bank put on them without
conceding a goal. On the
offensive they produced some
good moves a n d were unlucky
not to score off some of them.
L a t e in the first half I C d i d
manage to take the lead when
captain B o b Middleton knocked
a cross from emeritus captain
Dave Balderson into the back
of the net.
U n t i l half-way through the
second-half I C looked like
increasing their lead. T h e n
tradgedy struck when I C
sweeper Malcum C a l l u n was
injured and had to leave the
f i e l d .
The ensuing confusion in
the defence allowed the Bank
to score twice. I C sorted
themselves out and produced
a hard fight back i n the
attempt to e q u a l i s e . T h e
energy the team put in during
this period was rewarded when
Dave Balderson scored after
an excellent move down the
right wing. T h i s provided a
fitting end to a hard fought,
even and enjoyable match.

I C were not looking forward
to this game a s , they had
arrived with a team which w a s
two men short and were left
with a daunting task. T h e r e
was little time for reflection
and soon everyone had their
work cut out ( e s p e c i a l l y the
six-man pack who began to
show superior s k i l l and
managed to contain the
C o r n i s h pack.)
IC held back the C o r n i s h
attacks with some great
covering and started to look
dangerous themselves when
the backs received p o s s e s s i o n .
A l — though the IC pack w o n
a fair share of ball from l i n e -
outs and loose-rucks, it
needed a l l the team's energy
and determination to defend
w e l l against the continuous
Cornish pressure, which
mainly came from set scrums
where their two man advantage
was most t e l l i n g .
E v e n t u a l l y the C o r n i s h
scored from a penalty k i c k ,
given for a n infringement i n a
ruck. Showing great r e s i l i e n c e ,
I C went straight back at
C o r n i s h w h o proceeded t o
gave away a penalty, w h i c h
w a s duly put over by P a t D u n -
leavy to make it 3—3 at half-
time.
Although I C were beginning
to feel the pace they never-
theless took play into C o r n i s h ' s
half for long periods i n the
second-half. After a little
difference of opinion with an
I C player one of C o r n i s h ' s
forwards w a s sent .off. T h i s
gave I C added impetus a n d
after staying i n C o r n i s h ' s
25—line for a long s p e l l they
were rewarded with a try by
Ronnie Howard, who crashed
through a crowd of defenders
to put the b a l l over the l i n e .
P a t Dunleavy converted to
make it 9 - 3 for I C .
C o r n i s h came back i n a
last effort to salvage some-
thing but it was too late a n d
they s t i l l could not penetrate
I C ' s defence. T h e score
remained 9—3 at full-time.
T h i s w a s a really fine
performance by the whole
team but particularly the
forwards who played a s
though there w a s no tomorrow
and provided the backs w i t h
a chance to run with the b a l l .
They ' often threatened to
break through a n d were
unlucky not to score a couple
more times.

IC take off
in airport
competition
T h e C o l l e g e ' A ' T e a m came
third in the 2nd round of the
Airport B o w l ' s Inter-League
Tournament last Saturday. T h e
competition included teams
from Brunei U n i v e r s i t y , A v i s
Truck H i r e , H o r i i c k s , a n d
B r i t i s h A i r w a y s . T h i s put the
team 4th out of the 36 teams
entering, therefore, w e w i l l go
into the final oh thp 4th
December.
Simon Spurrier a n d P a u l
Bartlett rolled 495 a n d 4 9 4
respectively; a n d were w e l l
supported by Graham H i l l m a n
and Effendi A - R a h m a n . Simon
only just failed to gain
' N a t i o n a l 2 0 0 ' recognition
with 199!
E a r l i e r i n the day hangovers
from the G u i l d ' s C a r n i v a l were
noticeable during a match
against Southampton U n i v e r -
sity. T h e 2nds & 3rds each
took a game from Southampton,
but the l s t s were narrowly
beaten when the C a p t a i n h i t
only 5 pins i n the last frame to
leave the score at 621 against
622.
, T h e L a d i e s , with a depleted

overwhelming o d d s . More
L a d i e s would help the c l u b
to be more competitive i n
future matches.
