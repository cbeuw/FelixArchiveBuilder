Gutteridge hopes fade in last minute burst
It was an e x c e l l e n t l y struck
30—yard penalty k i c k , just o n
full-time, that finally robbed
IC of victory i n the second
round cup-tie at Harlington.
Up until that moment
the C o l l e g e side had looked
much better than G u y ' s
H o s p i t a l , and. the crowd went
away fully entertained 6y the
afternoon's rugby but certainly
bemused a s to how G u y ' s h a d
been able to snatch the game
away.
After some good attacking
play at both e n d s , the v i s i t o r s
scored first when a quick heel
at a scrum enabled their
winger to find room a n d dive
over the line, I C gradually
fought their w a y back into the
game and h i t a purple patch
that lasted throughout the
first half.
Their dominance at scrum,
ruck and maul, the powering
runs of L i p s c o m b e and the
splendid support work of
A s p d e n , Turley a n d M c L e a n
meant that I C were continually
going forward a n d exerting
pressure on the G u y ' s half-
hacks
Guy's break IC dominance
Colter, k i c k e d a penalty
after a forward had handled at
a ruck, A few minutes later
Parkinson ran in a try c l o s e
enough for Cotter to convert.
A t this stage I C threatened to
run away with the game. How-
ever, o n a quick attack the
visitors were rewarded w i t h
a penalty when Waugh w a s
adjudged to have struck t o o
early for a ball In the scrum.
Then, iowards half time,
I m p e r i a l C 1 9 v G u y ' s H o s p i t a l 2 0
Cotter k i c k e d another 40 yard
penalty to make the score
1 2 - 7 ,
From the restart I C k i c k e d
long a n d Forbes found touch
just 10 yards out. T h e ball
was wo'n at the line-out and it
went right along the three-
quarters before P a r k i n s o n w a s
tackled, just short o f the l i n e .
From the scrum, C o l l e g e
harassed the f l y half whose
clearance w a s caught by
Dunleary on the 25, He chipped
across-field a n d Gregory beat
the cover defence to the
touchdown by a fingertip.
Guy's keep fighting
16—7 then, yet somehow
G u y ' s continued to contest the
game and fully deserved to
score the try which they
created by a q u i c k l y ' taken
penalty midway through the
half. The result seemed beyond
doubt when Dunleary k i c k e d a
marvellous drop goal w i t h only
fifteen minutes to go.
Further pressure nearly
produced another try for I C
but, unfortunately G u y ' s broke
quick out of defense, their
backs burst through two t a c k l -
es a n d their right winger
sprinted up to the 10 yard line
before cutting inside to score
under the p o s t s ,
5 minutes to hang on
With the conversn>i .i more
formality, I C had five minutes
to hang onto a iwo point
lead. Our luck ran out when
the referee became very
unhappy about the feed into a

scrum and he p e n a l i s e d the
C o l l e g e to give the winning
points to the H o s p i t a l ,
So I C must wait another
season to bring back the
Gutteridge C u p , a n d the side
is left to consider what might
have been. It was a tremendous
performance from a team greatly
trouble by injury and although
in the end perhaps there w a s
a lack of maturity, one hopes
that the enthusiasm and
commitment c a n be maintained.
Team:- Cotter, Gregory,
Gilbert, Forbes, Parkinson,
Dunleary, Hobbs, McLean,
Waugh, Pullan, Lipscombe,
Aspden, Siomiac, Turley

Invasion gets mixed response
IC Water-polo team invaded
the Malet St pool last Tuesday
night to take part in the U L U
Handicap Knockout Competi-
tion with a n all-time record of
three teams. A t one stage it
seemed a s though the London
Underground would not be able
to cope w i t h the I C c o n t i n -
gency.
T h e F i r s t s
H a v i n g finally settled down
to play water-polo, I C 1, who
started play against U C L with
a five-goal deficit, gradually
made up the goal difference.
T h e teams were level a t full
time; I C w o n the penalty
competition, but just failed to
repeat the performance i n the
second round.
The Seconds .
I C 2 were not quite s o
s u c c e s s f u l . T h e y met and f e l l
to a strong G u y s 1 team, which
contained some familiar f a c e s .
Nevertheless the I C team d i d
have their moments, Sam made
his own contribution to the
game, and w a s sent out twice
in a row. T h e n , to the delight
of the crowd, he scored the
only goal for I C 2 . A n d Z e i n ,
in goal for the s e c o n d h a l f ,
produced a save that would
have done j u s t i c e to a n y
goalkeeper on dry l a n d .
and the Thirds
The honours of the night,
however, went to the I C T h i r d s .
T h i s team w a s composed of
the c l u b ' s new members (with
one exception), many of whom
were playing i n their first
match, Bu,t the handicapping
did not reflect this, and I C 3
went i n l e v e l . T h i s d i d not
perturb the team, w h o fought
for every b a l l and came away
having conceded a single
g o a l . A g a i n , there w a s some
outstanding goalkeeping, this
time from B r i a n D a v i e s , and
J i m Williams looked w e l l at
home i n attack.
