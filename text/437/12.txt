IC 'perversion' - fact
or fantasy?
COLLEGE NOTICE'
The Rector a n d C o l l e g e
Administration are i n for quite
a shock when they see next
month's press cuttings (for
IC), if this month's edition of
Lovebirds i s anything to go by.
F o r sandwiched in between
the stuck pages of this new
bastion of light-porn i s a n
article on the s e x life of us
students at I C . N o t that I
mind when someone does a
feature of my private f a n t a s i e s ,
but when the lady concerned
c a l l s the resultant article
' T h e imps of perversion pop-
ping it off in South K e n ' , then
I do start to take notice.
In point of fact I didn't
have anything to d o with this
article, our ex-printers just
happened to drop F E L I X a
copy. However, if y o u c a n
identify 'Horny J i m ' you may
be able to shed some light o n
this amusing story.
Jim i s the only IC student
interviewed i n L o v e b i r d s ,
although publisher and editor
Mary M i l l i n g ton says that she
talked to more students when
she came here 18 months a g o
( E d s note — The magazine i s
new and hence works a fair
bit in advance).
What prompted her to write
about the sex life of students?
" W e l l , most students are
pretty articulate and interest-
ing people, and I wondered
why nobody had bothered to
find out what their sex lives
were for,'
In the 2 page article we
learn that J i m is tall a n d
dark with a wiry body. H e
comes over as a conceited
stud, 'When word got round
that 1 was hot stuff you should
have seen the numbers of
girls that flocked around me.
1 was the screw of the year as
far as some of them were
concerned and I never lacked
a girl to take to bed with me',
says J i m .
Then something changed
his attitude to s e x and he
became a 'maute male, with
plenty of kinky sex habits'.
U p t i l l then J i m had had
'straight sex', but now
started dabbling i n group s e x .
The rest of the article is a
rather graphic portrayal of
J i m ' s first group sex experience
at Romford, E s s e x , with two
bisexual girls — one a n e x -
girlfriend who a l s o goes to I C .
'Well that was horny Jim
...students are sexy', says
Miss Millington a t the e n d .
But is the article genuine.
' Y e s ' said the former nude
model when contacted by
F E L I X . Certainly the photos
outside the new Huxley
B u i l d i n g of Miss Millington
are genuine, although s h e
neglects to mention the I C
male/female ratio — but puts
in that we have 4,000 students
— a n d mentions no bars, etc
where she met students.
• There just remains the
question of who 'Horny J i m ' i s .

Excessive Absence
Due to the e x c e s s i v e number of absences during the p a s t
year, it has become necessary to put the following new rules and
procedures into operation immediately :-
1. S i c k n e s s
No excuse — the Department Heads w i l l no longer accept
your doctor's certificate as proof. We believe that if you are able
to go to your doctor you are able to attend work.
2. Death (Your Own)
T h i s w i l l be accepted as a n e x c u s e . We should like to have
two weeks notice however s i n c e we feel it is your duty to train
someone else for your job.
3. Death (Other than your Own)
T h i s i s no e x c u s e . There is nothing you c a n do for them and
henceforth no time off w i l l be allowed for funerals. H o w e v e r ,
incase this should cause some hardship to some employees, there
are those who might care to note that on your behalf the company
has a s p e c i a l scheme in conjunction with the L o c a l C o u n c i l for
lunchtime burials, thus ensuring that no time is lost from the job,
4. L e a v e Of A b s e n c e F o r A n Operation
We w i s h to discourage any thought you may have of needing a n
operation and henceforth no leave of absence w i l l be granted for
hospital v i s i t s . T h e management believes that a s long a s you
are an employee here, you w i l l need a l l of whatever you already
have and should not consider any of it being removed. We en-
gaged you for your particular job with a l l your parts, and having
anything removed would mean that we would be getting l e s s
than we negotiated for,
5. V i s i t to T o i l e t s
F a r too much time is spent i n this practice. In future the
procedure w i l l be that all personnel shall go in alphabetical order
For example, those with their surname beginning with the letter
' A ' w i l l go from 9.30 to 9.45am, ' B ' w i l l go from 9.45 to 10am e t c .
Note
T h o s e of you who are unable to attend at your appropriate
time w i l l have to wait until the next day when your turn comes
round.
