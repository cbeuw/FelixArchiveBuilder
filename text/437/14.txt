Dear
Mickey....
The Head of one of t h e
country's bigger educational
institutions, a man o n £14,000
a year, calculated the other
day that he might be better off
out of work.
The sum, he admits, i s
fairly rough and ready, and
there are no doubt complicated
administrative p r o v i s i o n s
tucked away i n the small print
which would thwart h i s p l a n .
But it works roughly like this.
He h a s three children. N o w
suppose h i s wife and the
children a l l go to university.
A n d suppose he gives up h i s
job and goes to university.
H i s wife and children would
grants of £675 each — assum-
ing they l i v e d at home. H e ,
as a mature student, c o u l d
perhaps expect grants totalling
£2,165. A d d it a l l together -
and it comes to £4,865, and
oveir
"the thirty-week university
year, that works out a £650
a month. A t the moment, after
tax a n d superannuation h e
gets £620 a month. A l l he
had to d o , he reckoned, was
count i n the cost of having to
buy business suits and
travelling to work — and he
would be betjpr off a t the
head of a family'of students.
