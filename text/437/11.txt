Comparison with other colleges
L o o k i n g a t the Unions of other
c o l l e g e s , we find a number of differences.
Many arise from our C C U structure, w h i c h
is almost the same as the J C R s y s t e m
at R e a d i n g , Y o r k or L a n c a s t e r , although
the p h y s i c a l delineation of the C o n -
stituent C o l l e g e s has almost disappeared
(look at New Huxley). Our E x e c committee
is much smaller than at most other
U n i v e r s i t i e s and has l e s s power.
We have fewer sabbatical U n i o n
officers p e r capital than other U n i o n s ,
and s o matters are s t i l l delegated b y
C o u n c i l to a Plethora of sub-committees,
and effectively to their chairmen.
One consequence i s that fewer
officers are elected by campus-wide
ballot (4) than at most other large Unions.
Another i s that the representatives o n
one C o l l e g e committee a r e often i n
ignorance of events at other committees
until the.next C o u n c i l meeting. Perhaps
more power in fewer hands fs the answer
— i t would a l s o make greater competition
for posts, most of which are unopposed,
and so produce a more representative
C o u n c i l .
There are three areas w h i c h , i n many
large U n i o n s , are represented on the
C o u n c i l and often directly o n the
E x e c u t i v e ; these are Entertainments,
P u b l i c a t i o n s , a n d Transport. A t I C ,
probably for h i s t o r i c a l r e a s o n s , t h e
E n t s Committee has been treated a s a
society and h a s little ' p o l i t i c a l '
weight.
P u b l i c a t i o n s i s a n area that the
U n i o n i s just beginning to notice, a n d
through P u b l i c a t i o n s Board the media
are coming c l o s e into the Union structure.
Transport i s a thorn i n the U n i o n ' s
s i d e , since it has never been organised
centrally in the U n i o n , alway being left
to one of the major subcommittees (or
two of y o u include coach hire). T h e r e
are many problems in this area — a s k any
member of C o u n c i l or of rfte A C C a n d
R C C general committees!
I hope that this article h a s g i v e n
some of my readers (hello — has anyone
reached the end of the article?) (thank
the good chap above - y e s T y p i s s s t ) ,
an insight into the U n i o n which runs
the s o c i e t i e s to which they belong, a n d
which publishes this newspaper.
I now hope y o u ' l l put your pens t o
paper and make a few c r i t i c i s m s of the
Union either direct to the Permanent
Working Party, or through the letters
column of F E L I X . (May they please be,

Nights at
Waterloo
Miss P a t Simmons retired last F r i d a y ,
having answered 430 million 'phone c a l l s
in the last thirteen years. A t the Young
V i c in The C u t , near Waterloo Station, a
double bill of plays by T o m Stoppard
has opened.
The connection between those two
sentences is the play // You're Glad,
I'll be Frank, which opens the Y o u n g
V i c evening. Based on a clever i d e a ,
whose force i s spent in the opening
minute, and a contemplation of the
nature of time, the play h a s , a s its
central character, the girl who tells y o u
the time if y o u dial T I M (or rather 123
in these days of technological s u c c e s s ) .
Natash Pyne plays G l a d y s , presiding
over the multiple s e t from her perspex
booth, musing about the differences
between time measured in seconds a n d
minutes and TIME measured in ages and
aeons. Roy Hudd appears a s her husband
Frank, a bus driver, chasing up the
echelons of the Post Office to the F i r s t

Lord, w h o reveals the secret of T I M

Originally a radio play, Glad/Frank
serves a s a curtain-raiser to the main
boat of the evening — T h e Real Inspector
Hound, a glorious send up of those
pretentious c r i t i c s w h o e n d l e s s l y
compare performances ( " T h e finest
cynthia since the w a r " ) .
Mr Hudd appears again a s the c r i t i c
Birdboot, ever lasting after the leading
lady, whilst h i s companion Moon (Geof-
frey Hutchings) dreams of becoming t h e
first string critic of h i s paper. The play
they have come to s e e is a splendidly
ham performance of a thriller in the
"Who killed thing; noone w i l l leave the
h o u s e " v e i n . Mysteriously the c r i t i c s
are drawn into the performance in a way
which it would be churlish of me to
reveal. Suffice it to say that the double
bill is delightfully presented and w e l l
worth a v i s i t .
Meanwhile back at the ranch-house,
or rather the Lyttelton auditorium at the
National Theatre, Thomas Bernhard's
The Force of Habit is playing in two

Satre tradgedy
Eric Stovell previews the forthcoming
Dramsoc production ' T h e F l i e s '
On four nights next week (Wednesday
December 8th to Saturday December 11th
at 7.30pm in the Union Concert H a l l )
Imperial C o l l e g e Dramatic society are
presenting Jean-Paul Sartre's 'The
Flies'.
The plot is loosely based on the
Greek tragedy of Oresters, who returns
home after an absence of fifteen y e a r s
with high ideals of avenging h i s father's
murder. But the hosti le reception he gets
from the diffident townsfojk and, indeed,
from h i s sister E l e c t r a , change his mind.
emptier. T h e play is s e t in the decrepit
caravan home of a c i r c u s Ring-master.
Outside the caravan the characters a r e
Juggler, Tight-rope dancer, C l o w n and
L i o n tamer, but inside, with the R i n g
master, they are to perform the Trout
Quintet of Schubert; or rather rehearse
it, s i n c e the Ring master's only hope
is to keep h i s troupe together long
enough for them to become proficient
m u s i c i a n s .
What improves the second a c t i s that
the instruments are out and the actors
show themselves to be not at a l l b a d
musicians. Oliver Cotton's C l o w n
dolefully draws the Trout theme out on
his bass, whilst Warren C l a r k e ' s L i o n -
tamer goes through agonies on the
piano, h i s hands bandaged after a
mauling from a lion. Imperturbably in
the middle is the Ring master, P h i l i p
L o c k e , full of legends of h i s hero P a b l o
C a s a l s , reminding h i s players that a l l
w i l l be better " i n Augsburg tomorrow".
The ingenious setting, designed by
Timothy O'Brien and T a z e e n a F i r t h
contains, besides the open-sided
caravan, a large lorry and an enormous
number of empty beer-cans, which a r e
kicked about mercilessly by the departing
actors.
Thomas Stevenson
flies back to IC
T h i s story was of particular interest
to Sartre because he wrote it during t h e
early days of the last war when F r a n c e
had been overrun by H i t l e r ' s troops,
but had not yet formed an underground
resistance.
Satre's version of the story reveals
some of the ideas to be found in h i s
other plays and books, particularly i n
Orestes struggle for freedom from t h e
influence and control of the god Z e u s .
