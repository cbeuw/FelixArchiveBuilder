Xmas Social Security
Their has been a certain
amount of confusion over the
present situation regarding
vacation benefits. When the
new grant came into effect in
September '76, the composition
of the grant w a s changed,
increasing the vacational
element, which is only payable
during the Christmas and
Easter vacation, to £11.35,
this amount being deducted
from any supplementary
Benefit claim made.
How to Claim:
Claims c a n only be made
when y o u are available for
work, s o you must try and find
work; go first to your local
Job Centre where they w i l l try
and provide you with employ-
ment. It w i l l be considered
unreasonable if you turn down
general employment, but you
wouldn't be expected to under-
take heavy phsical work or
unsocial hours.
If you fail to get a job
after having made an effort,
you should a s k the clerk at
the J o b Centre to register you
unemployed. He w i l l then
direct you to the Unemployment
Benefit Office to register. A t
this stage a s k for form B 1 ,
as without this you w i l l be
unable toreceiveSupplementary
Benefit (ie you w i l l get
nothing).
When you have completed
form B 1 , post or take it to
your local Department of
Health and Social Security
(DHSS). A l s o make an appoint-
ment for an interview there.
When you go to the interview
make life easy a s p o s s i b l e by
taking along documentary
evidence of your a s s e t s ,
bank statements ( s a v i n g s
up to £1200 won't affect your
claim), together with your
expenses such as rent books.
If your claim is satisfactory,
payment commences on the
pay day after your form B1
has been received. T h e amount
and duration of your benefit
w i l l be printed on forms B
2 / 3 when you next sign on at
the Unemployment Benefit
Office.

h Will you get?
The basic a l l o w a n c e is for
£10.15 per week if you are not
a householder; to this a rent
allowance of £1.20 i s added.
Rent is paid in full if you are
residing at your permanent
address. If you go home but
s t i l l have to pay for your
term accommodation, you should
claim an Exceptional C i r c u m -
stances Addition towards this
c o s t .
A s the single non house-
holder s c a l e rate i s the same
as the vacational element of
your grant, it is unlikely that
you w i l l receive any benefit if
you go home and are not
paying for your term accommo-
dation (ie a s IC halls and
houses\. Nevertheless, •the
important fact is that y o u
should s t i l l claim a s the
DHSS have made no compen-
sation for the parental
contribution.
The situation c a n be
difficult to comprehend s o if
you have any problems, please
contact the Welfare Centre
any lunchtime between 12.30
and 1.30; the Centre is on the
3rd floor of the Union B u i l d i n g .

I'm getting s i c k of writing
this
And I daresay you don't
find it scintillating
reading
either, s o I'll stop trying t o
make things rhyme. My muse
isn't exactly raining inspira-
tion down on me at the mo,.
There must be a blockage on
the C e l e s t r i a l A i d L i n e . I
hope you've a l l got the gist
Are you able to cope
with a rape crisis?
Imagine a situation; y o u
are at home on your own, and
a c l o s e friend comes i n . She
may be hysterical and inco-
herent, or she may be s o calm
and c o l l e c t e d that y o u have
never seen her that way
before. Y o u give her a coffee
and eventually s h e tells y o u
that she thinks she has been
raped, and she does not know
what to do.
So now you have to h e l p
her; but do you know what she
should do? Should s h e go to
the P o l i c e Station and report
it, or should s h e go directly
to a doctor? If so, how soon?
If she goes to the P o l i c e , she
may have to go through hours
of questioning, and y o u c a n
see that she i s in no state to
be able to cope with this.
B e s i d e s , s h e only s a i d that
she thought she had been
raped. A s she is reluctant to
talk about what actually
happened, how do you find out
if it really was rape?
Well there is a group that
you can phone up, and talk to,
called the Rape C r i s i s Centre.
They w i l l talk to y o u , share
experiences, give y o u legal
a d v i c e , go to the P o l i c e
Station with you. If you decide
to press charges, w i l l go t o
court with y o u .
Most of the women at the
centre have themselves been
through this experience, and
try to help other rape victims
by operating a rape hotline
(emergency no. 340 6145)
On Tuesday December 7th
at 7pm Kathryn Muller w i l l be
coming to talk about the centre
So if you are interested come
along then to the ICWA Lounge.

in retaliating to IF O n l i e s .
They go under the false name
of T . P . — obviously trying to
impress by shielding them-
selves under the initials o f a

With the re-appearance of

certain rather sordid column
creeping back into F E L I X .
Now for a i l of you who don't
know what I mean, y o u w i l l
doubtless discover within the
next few w e e k s , that there
are certain young men at IC
issomewhat lacking, e s p e c i a l l y
in the E n g l i s h language, there
is a certain " j e ne s a i s q u o i "
about their a r t i c l e s .
We're a l s o thinking of a
new name for this 'ere literary
masterpiece IF R U 1e seemed
a good idea ^Institut F r a n c a i s
du Royaume-Uni-Premier for
a l l the monolinguists who are
unaware of our title), but there
was some e x c u s e mumbled
about no raised letters on the
F E L I X headliners, s o that
one's out. We've had sugges-
tions of I F U d o , I F U don't,
P r l F a b r i c a t i o n , and, of course,
a l l the sundry crudities that
always seem to crop up from
certain s e c t o r s . W e l l . . .
