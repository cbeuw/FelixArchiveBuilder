A significant stage towards
making the U n i o n ' s Alternative
Prospectus ( A P ) editorially
independent of C o l l e g e w a s
reached at C o u n c i l on Monday
evening. The c o u n c i l gave the
A P an additional £1,300 .to
ensure that next year's edition
is completely Union financed-
In doing so C o u n c i l rejected
a proposal by the A c a d e m i c
Affairs Officer ( A A O ) P a u l
Ekpenyong that the extra
finance should be sought from
the^College's S o c i e t i e s ' F u n d .
The need for more c a s h
(£2,600 instead of £1,300)
came a s a result of p o l i c y
changes i n the printing
industry.
C o u n c i l felt that by going
to C o l l e g e for the money it
would put next y e a r ' s A P i n
an editorial stranglehold,
similar to that w h i c h troubled
this year's (and debut) edition.
Then the C o l l e g e A d m i s s i o n s
P o l i c y C o m m i t t e e .(APC)
ordered that the P r o s p e c t u s
be re-edited mid-way through
printing.
Next year's A P w i l l be the
first one to be fully circulated
to s c h o o l s , since last y e a r ' s ,
which arrived two w e e k ' s ago,
is — due to the A P C ordered
reprint — only for internal
distribution.
Copy deadline for the next
edition is F r i d a y January 14th.
A l l entries should be sub-
mitted to A A O P a u l E k p e n -

referendum on whether to remain affiliated to NUS. The

COPY DEADLINE
FOR NEXT ISSUE -
MONDAY 2pm
It was a l s o decided at the
U G M by a 3 to 2 majority,
that I C U should not. reaffiliate
to the London Students
Organisation.
Uproar
The d e c i s i o n to organise a
referendum was reached after
a noisy debate. Thig resulted
from a n attempt to move
straight to a vote on the
main motion (to have a
referendum) immediately after
the proposer's speech without
any opposing speech.
T h i s procedural motion
(that a vote be taken) w a s
carried by a large majority,
but uproar followed with c r i e s
of 'not democracy' and claims
for the right of opposition
speech.
Mr N i c k B r a y s h a w , I C U
P r e s i d e n t , pointed out that
by right the procedural motion
should stand, but sensing the
mood of the opposition,
quashed it, and allowed a
reply to the proposition.
The reply took the form of
an attack o n the railroading
' t a c t i c s of the right w i n g ' by
an unidentified speaker. T h i s
prompted R C S U V P Steve
Braud to c a l l for a card
check of U n i o n members. A
check was then h e l d .
T h e meeting then calmed
down and" the vote resulted
in a c l e a r majority i n favour
of a referendum.
LSO debate
A t the L S O debate Mr Trevor
P h i l l i p s , L S O secretary,
(and ex-President I C U ) spoke
against withdrawal from L S O ,
pointing out that L S O was a n
organisation designed to
to help smaller c o l l e g e s
develop through a i d supplied
by larger members.
He emphasised that L S O
was a young organisation and
that large c o l l e g e s w h i c h
stayed outside last year have
now j o i n e d . H e s a i d 'ICU
would be going against the
trend' if it withdrew and that
'we owe it to smaller organ-
isations to play our part'.
Despite h i s eloquence,
'ICU has little to show for
membership of LSO' s a i d Mr
Hugh Barrett (proposer).
' O b j e c t i v e l y - we put £500 a
year i n and what do we get?
Trev P h i l l i p s a n d not much
e l s e ' .
T h e motion not to reaffliate
was carried by 210 votes to
141, with 26 abstentions.
I C U has been a member of
L S O since its formation two
years ago, a n d joined during
Mr P h i l l i p s ' term a s I C U
P r e s i d e n t . H o w e v e r the
question of I C U ' s affiliation
had. never been put to a U G M ,
this w a s rectified at yester-
day's meeting.
Benefaction
given new life
The anonymous benefactor
who offened I C £350,000 to
build an extension to L i n s t e a d
H a l l has extended the deadline
on h i s benefaction to January
1978.
A n original condition o f
the gift was that the C o l l e g e
be 'in a position to start
building on the (extension site
by January 1977'. T h i s became
impractical when Westminster
C i t y C o u n c i l rejected a
C o l l e g e plans for the site
five weeks ago.
After debating the i s s u e
at a Governor's meeting o n
November 1 9 t h , the C o l l e g e
has decided not to appeal
against the d e c i s i o n , not to
oppose the ' a l t e r n a t i v e '
Knightsbridge Residents A s s o -
c i a t i o n ' s p l a n s , a n d to con-
sider commissioning a new
design for the e x t e n s i o n ,
dependent upon the view of the
F i n e A r t s C o m m i s s i o n ,
Dep.Reps.
to stay
A proposal that the Depart-
ment Representatives be
removed from C o u n c i l w a s
defeated by the latter a t i t s
meeting o n Monday. T h e
proposal came from the
Union's Permanent Working
Party ( P W P ) , whose s p o k e s -
man R o s D a r l i n g s a i d the
Reps were superfluous a n d
presented no useful b u s i n e s s
to C o u n c i l .
Opposing the recommend-
ation External Affairs Officer
Hugh Barrett s a i d that D e p
Reps were more representative
of students than the P W P , who
along with O l d Students reps
and Constituent C o l l e g e
Academic Affairs Officers
should be struck off C o u n c i l .
C o u n c i l rejected the P W P
proposal but d i d not vote o n
any other proposals to d i m i n i s h
C o u n c i l ' s s i z e . A more s u c -
c e s s f u l resolution from t h e
P W P , that the U n i o n - E x e c -
utive — a s the D i s c i p l i n e
Committee — must s i t w i t h i n
10 days of a n a l l e g e d d i s -
c i p l i n e offence instead of .the
present 2 , w a s adopted a s
