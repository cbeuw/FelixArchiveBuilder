6 - F E L I X , D E C E M B E R 3rd 1976
A somewhat gloomy picture
for Imperial C o l l e g e was
painted by the Rectof, S i r
Brian F l o w e r s , in h i s annual
address to Union C o u n c i l on
Monday evening.
The C o l l e g e , like other
educational institutions, had
been led to believe that its
grant from the Government's
University Grants Committee
( U G C ) would be cut by 40%
for next year. The Rector s a i d
that this cut would probably
materialise a s 6%, and that
this could be expected t o
last until 1980.
Although the exact value
of I C ' s grant from the U G C
w a s unclear, the Rector
reiterated the need for
economies; new ventures w i l l
w i l l only be started at the
expense of o l d .
However, a 6% cut would
Invited q u e s t i o n s from
C o u n c i l . In answer to one on
' I C U ' s effectiveness' by R o s
Darling, S i r Brian commented
'The Union has become a step
more effective every year I've
been associated with it.' H e
a l s o praised S T O I C and F E L I X
who got better and better each
year.
No Sabbatical DP
Later on in C o u n c i l Nick
Brayshaw announced that the
Rector had turned down a
Union request for another
sabbatical officer (to look
after I C U ' s buildings and
finance work — ie a sabbatical
D P ) . In a letter to the I C U
President the Rector s a i d
that he thought the Union
already had a generous a l l o c -
ation of sabbaticals (at
present three).
kouncil kapers
A report on Monday night's Council meeting
impose a need for redundan-
c i e s greater than the normal
wastage. T h e paradox here,
was, said the Rectop, how
could c o l l e g e s make staff
redundant — s o paying them
redundancy money — whilst
cutting back on overall
expenditure. T h i s problem was
faced by a l l universities and
would have to be solved
nationally.
Fees disappointment
Sir Brian went on to express
disappointment at the new
course fees for next year. The
Government's d e c i s i o n w a s
'the worst possible c h o i c e ' ;
both he and the Committee of
V i c e - c h a n c e l l o r s and P r i n c i -
pals were against discrimin-
ation a g a i n s t overseas
students. They would rather
see discrimination between
undergraduates and post
graduates. Now the Govern-
ment had both.
The only note of c o n s o l a -
tion w a s that the drop in
value of £ might lessen the
effect of fees increases to
overseas students.
Afterwards the Rector
Other matters d i s c u s s e d at
Council were:- T h e s i z e of
council ( s e e front page)., a
new Overseas student major
sub-committee (see front
page); a proposal that the ICU
Bookshop or the Union s e l l
quick turnover goods such a s
s l o p shirts and sports equip-
ment w a s referred to the
Permanent Working Party.
Fees letter
Council heard that a letters
opposing the new fees increases
would be sent to E d u c a t i o n
Secretary Shirley Williams on
Friday. T h e letters would be
duplicated by IC U n i o n ,
signed by students and
deliever in bulk to Mrs
Wi I liams.
A proposal from the Honary
Secretary that main U n i o n
officers submit interim reports
(on their work s o far) to t h e
next C o u n c i l was carried.
At the meeting R C S Union
were awarded £400 t o cover
overspending on last year's
handbook, R S M U n i o n ' s P G
Group w a s given £120 and
S T O I C £100 to cover i n -

V.I.P. plus kilt
Joan of A r c , Newton,
Faraday and Darwin have
something in common (apart
from being dead, that i s ) .
They are a l l very important
Persons — to Prof. Scorer
of the Maths Dept at any rate.
At last Monday's Wellsoc
lecture he tried to s h o w that
his V I P ' s are only produced
by avoiding the established
educational process — the
only way that people can grow
up to ignore traditional
authority and thus to break new
ground in their chosen f i e l d .
Prof Scorer — dressed in a
red, blue and green kilt,
matching t i e , sporran etc (but
NO dirk!) — included a
survey of the Earth's history
and showed how vital the
presence of life is to the
composition of the atmosphere.
He then looked at Homo
Sapiens himself, and tried to
justify his label of ' C l e v e r
Morons' by pointing out that,
although science and tech-
nology are a l l very w e l l ,
Society engages in only short
term views of the world.
Hence the population,
mineral resource and energy
c r i s e s . Indeed, by comparison
with locusts, he suggests
that the Earth is suffering
from a plague of humanity. The
reaction to this shows up in
politics a s demands for
devolution in this country and
separatism in Quebec, Bavaria
etc a s the individual becomes
increasingly swamped by the
exponentially increasing pop-
ulation.
Even for those who d i s -
agreed with some of his points
this w a s a thought provoking
talk. Further talks this year
include 'Extraterrestial life,'
' C u l t s of Unreason', ' V i k i n g s
and Martions' and ' C l i m a t i c
change; Global Catastrophe?

Due to the lack of response
we have decided to cancel
the ICWA Treasure Hunt and
return a l l entry fees. F o r the
sake of the ignorant I s h a l l
explain the c l u e s and a l s o
give y o u the fourth clue a n d
see if you can manage to solve
that one.
1st Clue:- T h e capital w a s
L i s b o n whose money is
escudoes. Not black but white
means swop the B for W;
confused gives Wilson who i s
a l s o the M P w h o i s invest-
igating the dealings of the
c i t y . So simple, it makes
you feel a fool doesn't it.
2nd Clue:- T h e answer w a s
Bowers which w a s s o simply
I can't really s a y any more.
3rd Clue:- Well unless y o u
never went to school before
you came here the answer
was simple — Scott A s h
Madeleine to explain.
If anybody has any con-
fidence in their own ability
left then here's the fourth
c l u e : -
For what you seek you all
can find opposite a temple,
unless you're blind beside a
Wellington - (not Paddington
bear's) Its there to see for he
who cares.
Judging by the answering
ability on the previous c l u e s
I'll give y o u ' T i l l E a s t e r t o
think about it and until summer
to think about the answer!!!
