It's difficult to write a review of G u i l d s C a r n i v a l , there's so
much and so little you can say — so much good entertainment
and bugger a l l to grumble about.
Alan White made me glad I'd gone to C a r n i v a l ; it wasn't
that his songs are original — they're not — but it was the
enthusiasm and character he put into them that counted.
Broadly speaking he's a folk artist that enjoys having a good
time, jokes around a fair bit, and takes the p out of xxxxxxx
like Dave Lord. He went down extremely well and warmed
everyone up with the odd 'chorus'.
Squeeze were a different kettle of f i s h . U n l i k e A l a n White
they didn't have to ad-lib to chants & in-jokes of e e l s and
a l s a t i a n s . They're a down to earth band — not so much as the
Feelgoods — who could justifiably fit into the respectable
end of the punk rock s e c t i o n . B a s i c & unpretentious, they had
many people dancing before the end of their set.
By the time Sassafras came along I was really into the
party mood, courtesy of the d i s c o and the general crowd at this
extraveganza.
More sophisticated and talented than their predecessors,
Sassafras proved worthy bi 11-toppers. I'd seen them down at
Reading in the summer, when I thought they were just brash and
abraisive enough to Hearten a festival audience.
Last Friday they were somewhat tamer. There was more
attention to the fine grissly detail, and I could hear the v o c a l s
for once. Their repertoire was a mixed bag of intellectual rock
and hard hittin' trucking m u s i c . A lot of it came from the band's
latest vinyl effort 'Riding High' on C h r y s a l i s .
A s the night progressed Sassafras boogied a lot more,
taking with them a now gullible crowd. T h e y finished up with
a couple of Beatles numbers - a pity s i n c e their own material
is quite original.
Apart from the films, the beer, the d i s c o etc, that was
C a r n i v a l . It came over rather well and there was certainly a
fair whack of good organisation behind it. T a very much G u i l d s .
