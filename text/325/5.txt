Massive cut backs in
living standards were an-
nounced by M r . Heath i n
what he called a "fair
deal". Commenting on the
reasons behind these
measures he continued,
" O w i n g to the present
World crisis i n capitalism
we, as the executive of the
ruling class, are forced to
lower the standard of liv-
ing of the working class in
order to lower the value
of labour a n d thus main-
tain our profits—whoops,
what a give away!" N o
one can expect a rise of
more than £5 per week
over the next three years
in the totally new wage
negotiation structures pro-
posed in the Government
White Paper issued last
Wednesday.

However inessential
commodities such as food
will have no restrictions
on price rises, likewise
anything from abroad,
anything subject to seas-
onal or externally caused
price fluctuations or whose
price is fixed by interna-
tional agreement, or any
manufactured g o o d s
whose price rises are due
to "unavoidable" cost in-
creases. This leaves . . .

Downing Street, etc.
Daft
" I ' m not as daft as you
think, ejaculated M r . A n -
thony Barber, Chancellor
of the Exchequer, his fing-
ers tightening on a copy
of the " N e w Humanist",
although 1 admit it has
taken over 2\ years since
we took office to think up
a suitable name for the
plan that would succeed
Phase 1."
Silly
In a typical altruistic
move, which we have
come to think of as the
hall-mark of the Heath
administration, the present
rent allowance for lower
paid workers will be in-
creased slightly so that in
three years time they
"would normally pay no
more than now". " B u t
these are not normal
times," stressed M r . Bar-
ber. "They are times of
great stress. A s we have
made all strikes and
threatening to strike illeg-
al, and we're working on
a thinking about beginning
to start to maybe conceive
of threatening to strike
bill to be incorporated i n -
to our conspiracy laws".
Sillier
Lists of sycophantic ad-
jectives have been rushed
to a l l the main newspaper
offices i n time for a criti-
cal analysis of the govern-
ment's every move over
the next few months.
Promises have been given
by the leaders of all major
trades unions to put up a
short-lived indignation at
this latest attack on the
living standards of the
Working class. "Strictly off
the record, old boy," con-
tinued M r . Barber, "1
simply have no idea how
much longer their grass
roots membership will
allow itself to be fobbed
off with this kind of hog-
wash."
Silliest
In a statement on Divi-
dends, M r . Heath said
"This is the crux of our
moves, dividend increases
will have a ceiling twice
that of wage increases.
A n y profit over and above
the ceiling, we shall
plough back into the firm
and so increase our share
values."
Talking about student
grant increases, he con-
tinued, " N o t a chance,
they are no different from
workers. I said this is a
fair deal and we're going
to be fair; we'll screw
everybody."
When questioned on
inflation, he replied, " O f
course these moves will
cause inflation, hence they
will lower the standard of
living of the working
class, and so lower the
value of labour and thus
we can maintain our fall-
ing profits, which is the
sole point of our moves.
No, the only way the
working class can stop us
now is to kick us out and
r e t u r n a government
pledged to socialist poli-
cies, but they're much too
stupid to do that!"
Departmental meeting o n the issues
affecting the U n i o n can be effective i n
strengthening our democracy.
The first one, on the grants cam-
paign, Chemistry, proposed that I C or-
ganise a mass write-in to the Dept. of
Education and Science and a demonstra-
tion on Wednesday, February 7th, so
that we can deliver them in large sacks
to the stuffed shirted civil servants and
send i n a deputation. The idea is firstly
to get mass involvement of students in
something that can be done on a college
basis, get some publicity for the grants
claim and build up a little more of the
pressure that will be needed for victory.
If I C gets moving and does something
we can prove that we aren't just talkers
and compensate to some extent for the
way we let the other colleges down over
the rent strike.
Our neighbours Queen Elizabeth Col-
lege have decided to go on rent-strike as
well as organising refectory boycotts.
Refectory Boycotts
The last U G M mandated me to report
back about catering boycotts. The most
effective way appears to be to publicise
that there will be one on a certain day
but keep the particular ref. a secret until
just before opening. Then set up pickets
to persuade people to go elsewhere.
In this way the maximum impact is
made with minimum hardship to our-
selves.
A Vindication of Militancy
The statement by Prof. Gower, Vice-
Chancellor of Southampton University
that the government is heading for a
major confrontation with students if it
does not concede our claim quickly and
recognising the justice of our claim is
a result of the acute pressure being put
on the Vice-Chancellor by the rent-
strikes and catering boycotts.
This sort of statement can do us i m -
mense good in trying to win over public
opinion. In fact, the support the rent
strikes have won in this way refutes
completely the argument that rent-
strikes upset "public opinion", overall
the opposite has been the case.
In this situation it is sad that L o r d
Penney will not commit himself pub-
licly to our case. Informal chats along
the corridors of power will not change
this governments policy. Massive ac-
tions by students a l l over the country
plus support from as many sections of
the public as possible, can!
Drivel!
Finally, one misconception spread by
the Felix editorial last week should be
cleared up. N U S have every intention of
negotiating on higher grants — the delay
is from the D E S side. The part to be
played by the V C ' s is simply a pressuris-
ing one. W e would in no sense allow
them to negotiate for us.
M r . Dowson knows this perfectly well
as M r . Dowson attends every N U S con-
ference going.
The rest of the drivel i n his editorial
isn't worth commenting o n !

Linda Quinn (pictured left), President
of Stirling University, was suspended by
the university last week.
A meeting of the university disciplin-
ary committee voted by a majority of
three to two to suspend Miss Quinn for
four months for her alleged part in the
demonstrations during the Queen's visit
last October.
She inlends to appeal against the sen-
tence and claims there was a lack of
evidence. She told reporters that she was
being punished for organising the demon-
strations, not for taking part in them.
