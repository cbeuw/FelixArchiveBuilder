w i t h o u t r e a l l y d y i n g
This week, FELIX F I N A N C I A L L Y departs from its
normal format. S i n c e the inception of the page last
term, our financial adviser, D E R E K E. C U M M I N G S ,
insurance broker a n d iconoclast, has been asking
s o m e pertinent questions on behalf of students w h o
are thinking about the w o r l d beyond their finals, and
also making some fairly strong comments o n the
financial scene in general.
Next week, however, he reverts to h i s original
role in Imperial C o l l e g e — t h a t of a General Studies
lecturer. O n W e d n e s d a y , January 3 0 , he w i l l be
giving the first o f four lectures on financial subjects.
S o n o w , FELIX is about to cross-examine Derek
C u m m i n g s about that lecture, w h i c h i s to be entitled
" H o w to Lose M o n e y without Really D y i n g . " W e l l ,
the title is intriguing, so let's find out more.
F E L I X :
W h a t exactly is the title of next week's lecture
meant to mean?
C U M M I N G S :
It means this. That unless y o u are careful about
what kind of insurance policy you buy, you stand
to waste a lot of money. If you examine the w a y
most insurance companies operate, y o u will see
that most of the policies they sell to people w i s h -
ing to take out life assurance are endowment
policies — the sort where you pay premiums for
a fixed number of years and collect a lump s u m
at the end. If you d i e in the meantime, the c o m -
pany w i l l , of course, pay out. But if you live, you
will find y o u are actually losing money on the
deal.
F E L I X :
You're saying that insurance companies are con-
men, then?
C U M M I N G S :
I have said this before, a n d I'll s a y it again.
Insurance companies mislead the public into be-
lieving that endowment-type policies are best
for the public, w h e n in fact they are merely best
for the insurance companies. These policies very
skilfully entangle t w o factors concerning insur-
a n c e — t h e protection factor and the savings fac-
tor. W h e n it comes to providing for your
dependents in case of your death, insurance c o m -
panies are very good. But if y o u live, a n d your
policy becomes an investment for later life or
retirement, then endowment policies are dia-
bolically uncompetitive.
F E L I X :
If this is true, w h y have the insurance companies
been so successful in misleading the public?
C U M M I N G S :
Because insurance is an emotional business.
Everyone needs insurance of some kind. But the
insurance companies spend fortunes on promot-
ing only those kinds of policy w h i c h will be most
profitable to themselves.
F E L I X :
Y o u say w e a l l need insurance of some k i n d ?
C U M M I N G S :
Yes. If you o w n a motor car, the law obliges you
to have insurance. If y o u marry or have other
dependents, it's a pretty unreasonable man w h o
doesn't think to b u y insurance as protection for
them in case of his death. In both cases, it's a
matter of finding the best possible policy to fit
the circumstances. A n d endowment policies are
not it.
F E L I X :
A l l right, but w h y d o y o u say insurance c o m p a -
nies give the public a b a d deal on endowment
policies as a form of investment?
C U M M I N G S :
Because the very best of the insurance companies
take something like fifteen years to double your
money. But this country is currently taking only
eight to ten years to halve the purchasing power
of the pound. O n that scale, the insurance c o m -
panies are on the best end of the deal by a very
long way.
FELIX:
H o w d o y o u substantiate that argument?
C U M M I N G S :
A n Economist survey dated 18th J u l y 1 9 7 0 shows
that the top s i x insurance companies take about
fifteen years to pay back double what a policy-
holder pays in p r e m i u m s on a n e n d o w m e n t
policy. M e a n w h i l e , a Central Statistical Office
report dated M a r c h 1 9 7 2 states categorically
that the pound is halving its real value in about
8 or 9 years.
FELIX:
Are y o u saying that any insurance is a waste of
time a n d a potential waste of m o n e y ?
C U M M I N G S :
Let m e put it this way. If y o u have no financial
obligations, forget a l l about insurance. O n the
other hand, it is m y firm opinion that young
people should d o a l l they c a n to save vigor-
ously for some objective, w h i c h m a y be a long
way short of retirement. B u y i n g a house, for
example. A s for life assurance, it's fine a n d very
useful — providing there is a need for protection.
FELIX:
W e l l , y e s , I suppose w e a l l agree in principle
that saving for the future is a g o o d thing. W h a t
w o u l d y o u suggest as the best form it should
take?
C U M M I N G S :
Put your money into a building society. It costs
only a couple of quid to open an account, a n d
you get interest on it. Furthermore, it puts you, as
an investor, at the top of the list w h e n it comes
to getting a m o r t g a g e — a n d that's something y o u
w i l l be very likely to want in the future. Just c o m -
pare t h e t w o methods of saving for a moment.
Insurance companies take your valuable pounds
today a n d your gradually less valuable pounds
over, say, the next fifteen years. A t the e n d of
the period, they'll maybe pay y o u back double
the paper value — but in very m u c h devalued
currency. W i t h house purchase, y o u reverse the
process. Y o u borrow s o m e b o d y ' s valuable pounds
today and repay them with devaluing money. A t
the same time, you're buying a c o m m o d i t y w h i c h
is always increasing in real value. Furthermore,
that increasing value is more than enough to off-
set the interest y o u pay for your borrowing.
There's no question about w h i c h is the best value.
FELIX:
But what about the protection factor in insur-
ance? W h a t advice w o u l d y o u give about that?
C U M M I N G S :
S p e n d as little as possible to achieve the maxi-
m u m possible cover. It c a n be done cheaply. I
know it can, and every insurance company in the
land knows it can. But there is a w o r l d of differ-
e n c e — n o t to mention profit—between knowing
about it and telling you about it. W h y should they
tell you? They're on to too g o o d a thing w i t h the
old endowment policy. N o , they won't tell y o u
unless y o u press them very h a r d — a n d neither,
for that matter will most insurance brokers.
FELIX:
But you are an insurance broker. Aren't you con-
demning your own profession?
C U M M I N G S :
Yes, I a m . O n e cannot really quarrel with the
insurance companies if they spend most of their
time putting forward the best possible proposi-
tion for themselves. But brokers are supposed to
be unbiased in putting the interests of their clients
first. But I a m afraid that is not often the case.
M o s t take the easy w a y out. It's in their interest
to sell you the type of policy the insurance c o m -
panies want to sell, since the broker's c o m m i s -
Page 3
sion is a percentage of t h e p r e m i u m paid. T h e
more you pay, the more the broker gets.
FELIX:
So h o w d o y o u justify your o w n position?
C U M M I N G S :
Because I take a rather different view of the job
I a m doing. I think m y c o m p a n y ' s long-term
interests are best served by giving the best pos-
sible service a n d thereby gaining our c l i e n t s '
respect a n d trust. Certainly, I c o u l d talk a client
into taking out a policy w h i c h w o u l d bring i n a
fat c o m m i s s i o n , but that outlook i s , in m y view,
a short-sighted one. I gain more by taking t h e
trouble to think about a client's real interests,
both at the present a n d in the future. I w o u l d
hope, for example, that what I have s a i d here
w o u l d make a n y student stop a n d think for a
moment before he runs out and buys insurance.
But I think I have said enough for the moment.
I have a w h o l e lot more to say at m y General
Studies lecture next week a n d I shall be more
than happy to answer any other questions at that
time.
obsessed w i t h the number of pages it carried i n
