O n the 28th January, the City and Guilds College
M o t o r C l u b will be holding its first major event; a
Production C a r T r i a l . This consists of a series of tests
on A r m y L a n d , some involving climbing as far as
possible up a steep dirt hill, whilst others involve short
timed tests around plastic pylons. The accent with this
type of event is on fun, but there will be serious
competition especially from members of other clubs.
A n y type of car is suitable for this sort of event:—
there are classes for most types of car. Y o u r ordinary
road car is a l l you need. Entry fee is £1 (to club
members). Spectators, are of course, very welcome.
The event will be held at Normandy H i l l , A s h , which
is near Aldershot. Full details may be obtained from
Jim Briggs, c/o City and Guilds U n i o n Office. Dept.

A r o u n d the end of last term, you may remember,
there were some people wandering about on the moon:
at about the same time a similar event took place
in Richmond Park when the Cross Country C l u b
descended upon it to hold their A n n u a l Handicap.
With brilliant handicapping by R o b Parker, eight
runners finished within a minute led, after making up
a quarter of a mile on Pad Donnelly in the last two
miles, by Dave Payne in an Actual Time of 31m. 57s.
Our first three matches this term were also in Rich-
mond Park. In the first we took on Sandhurst and
Vets, and lost scoring 33 points to Sandhurst's 14 and
Vets' 32. R o b Parker did 28m. 35s. and Kaliray 34m.
26s. Then we soundly beat L S E 54 to 90 (counting 8)
by finishing the first two, R o b Parker and Joe Keat-
ing together in 28m. 56s., and by packing in 10th—
14th. Last Wednesday, with a team robbed of its
strength by the injury to R o b Parker, we easily beat
a combined London Hospital-Kings team but lost
somewhat to the Met. Police who had five in the first
six. Allison was 4th in 30m. 30s. and Dave Payne
(31m. 50s.), Steve Webb (31m. 54s.), Neil Boag (32m.
15s.) and P a d Donnelly (36m. 40s.) all got personal
bests. F o r his services to handicapping, and to the
Flour Industry, R o b Parker was dubbed " 2 7 t h " and
given the honorary time of 44m. 55s.
Noticeable at these matches were three frozen scorers,
J i m Bathurst, H u g h Culverhouse and l a n Isherwood
and ceretain runners not so far mentioned: Pete John-
son, R o b Maddison, Andrew Baxter, Stuart Littlewood,
and of course(!) Paul Clarke.
This week's motto: a m a n without a smile shouldn't
keep a shop. Follow that Victor!

Last Sunday 1C first 15
played Wasps at Sudbury.
In the face of a far more
experienced side with an
estimated 2 stone per man
weight advantage I C put
up a respectable game but
as expected Wasps won
through to the next round
of the Middlesex cup at a
final score of Wasps 25,
I.C. 3.

F o r the first match of
the N e w Year the intre-
pid I.C. team ventured
into the uncharted wastes
of Tooting C o m m o n to
commence battle against
the apparently strong
Hillcroft Lacrosse team.
The insistence by t h e
referee o n the denuding of
Ian Guilford's knees
marred the start of the
game, but this was soon
forgotten as I.C., i n their
quest for the league title,
began to pressurise t h e
Hillcroft defence. Straight
from the face-off the mid-
field powered i n . The de-
termination of a l l i n the
team was evident, p a r t i a l -
Early of Lionel Clarke who
occasionally emerged with
the ball from almost i m -
possible situations. The
attack ably drew out H i l l -
croft's defence leaving a
few gaps which Whizz K i d
Spooner was always grate-
ful to utilize and, slipping
past his opposite number,
blasted i n five goals i n
the first quarter.
Hillcroft showed that
they were not to be easily
dismissed by replying with
two goals i n the first half.
Two goals by Tony H a l -
lett, the first from an am-
azing angle, and three
more from Whizz K i d ,
(but the less said about
that the better or he won't
be able to get his helmet
on next week!) showed
that the game was a l l
I.C.'s. N o w Hillcroft resor-
ted to bodily attack, lay-
ing out Pete Drury by a
vicious swipe at his ank-
les. However, Pete w a s
soon hopping about, after
he had been deposited i n
a nearby icy pond for
some improvised treat-
ment.
Throughout the game
the defence had been ex-
ceptional with some good
tackling and tight mark-
ing. B o b Strange way and
Sam Henry playing as
well as ever. Only nearer
the end when the defence
began to slacken did the
opposition manage to
come back with two more
goals. T h e final score:—
Imperial 10, Hillcroft 4.
A l l this was managed
with two last minute 'vol-
unteers', Pete M c D o n a l d
and Graham Clarke who,
despite having not played
before, soon settled into
the game remarkably
well. This shows that any-
one wanting to take up a
good, fast game with a
successful team should
consider lacrosse (what a
subtle plug!!).
Row Flares
Over Room
Charges
Social Clubs Committee is heading for a
major confrontation with college administra-
tion over hire charge for rooms used for SCC
club's meetings.
The row flared when M r . Victor Mooney, college
catering manager, asked for a £50 fee for the use of
the Senior C o m m o n R o o m , Southside, for a Chinese
New Year Dinner, due to be held on February 9th.
M r . Mooney claimed
that a condition of the use
of rooms was that no food
or drink could be impor-
ted into them, Gordon
Jackson, S C C Chairman,
told a F E L I X reporter.
The Chinese Society wan-
ted to bring their own food
— M r . Mooney could not
in any case supply it, on
his own admission.
However, according to
Mr. Jackson, no such con-
dition appears on the
booking form, and there is
no mention of a levy for
"flouting a regulation"
S C C met urgently on
Thursday to discuss the
matter, and passed a
strongly - worded motion
opposing "the principle of
charging College societies
for College rooms" and
"seeking clarification of
the role of the catering
manager i n obtaining
rooms, when no catering is
required from h i m " .
Mr. Mooney has also
asked for a fee of £25
from the South-East A s i a
Society for a Malaysian
Cultural Evening in the
SCR/Ante Room, College
Block.
A report has been sub-
mitted to Council next
Monday, and heated dis-
cussions are taking place.
In the meantime, S C C has
undertaken to pay the fees
if they are levied.
