If you are an undergraduate, you
are entitled to a grant of £480 a year.
Next year this will be raised to £500.
If you are lucky enough to live in hall
or student house, and your parents pay
you the full parental contribution, you
are probably not all that badly off. The
"notional element" in the grant for
board and lodgings is £275 in L o n d o n
(£240 elsewhere). Supposing that you
eat. chez Mooney three times a day,
it probably only costs you in the re-
gion of £230 - £240 — including £11 a
year new halls levy.
Only 1,200 students live in hall or
house. What about the other 2,800 of
you? L i v i n g in a digs with breakfast
provided costs, say, £6.50 a week dur-
ing term, and £2 a week retainer during
vacations. So between October and June
you pay £218 just for lodgings—add
Mooney food (about the cheapest re-
fectories in the University) and we arrive
at a figure of roughly £330 — £55 more
than allowed for in the grant.
Live in a flat, and you can expect to
be lucky to pay £6 a week right through
vacations, too. That's £234 — £345
with food, and £70 more than the no-
tional element. This is equivalent to
a cut of one-third in the amount al-
lowed for clothes, books, travel and
everything else.
The current grant level was negotiated
in 1971. This allowed for a rise i n
three stages: to £465 for 1971-72, £480
for 1972-73 and £500 in 1973-4. These
figures were based on previously ex-
perienced rates of inflation.
A "Student Cost Index" has been
calculated — pretty much the same as
the ordinary cost index, but leaving out
thinks like carpets and cookers and
other things that don't affect us, and
weighting everything that does correctly
(more or less). According to this, the
rise in costs in 1971-2 (academic year)
was 7.9%. The rise in grant was 2.9%.
When the grant levels were changed
in 1971, so was the floor of the parental
means test scale. This had an interest-
ing effect on the increases in the total
amount paid in grants by Local Educa-
tion Authorities. Whereas their pay-
ments increased by 1 2 % , the total
Action for Higher Grants
NOW
T e n days ago Imperial College U n i o n rejected a rent strike. Never-
theless, a substantial motion on grants w a s passed almost unanimously, a n d
the union executive is still pushing for action. Posters based on this photo-
graph a n d slogan are already going up in all U S K colleges. T h e N U S is
organising demonstrations a n d a " D a y of A c t i o n " .
W e l l , w e a l l k n o w that every year, w i t h monotonous regularity, the
politicians amongst us organise a C a m p a i g n . Last year is w a s over the
autonomy issue. T h i s year it's grants. But before y o u go off into a corner,
curl up, cover your face with F E L I X a n d go to sleep over what might appear
to be the inanity of it a l l , forget the " a c t i o n " a n d examine the facts. A worth-
while exercise. I hope y o u ' l l agree, s i n c e most of us rely solely on grants
for our livelihood during the a c a d e m i c year. No propaganda, promise: just
facts. Here they are.
parental contributions increased by
69% — or, at least, the amount that
should have been paid in parental con-
tributions did.
Not everyone is lucky enough to get
£480 a year, even in the university sec-
tor. If you're female and a student,
and thinking of getting married, the
government's advice would seem to be
"don't". A t least, not unless your in-
tended spouse is a student too. Because,
if he isn't, you only qualify for £275 —
subject to a means test on your parents.
That figure was fixed in 1965, and hasn't
been raised since.
O f course we in universities are
greatly privileged under the grants
scheme, for there is a mandatory rate
of grant.
Every undergraduate (not living at
home) at Imperial College is entitled
to £480 (subject to parental contribu-
tion), regardless of where he comes from
or where he lives in London. This is
not the case for students in further (as
opposed to higher) education — for
example, technical and art colleges.
These students are on discretionary
awards. The discretion is that of the
Local Education Authority, and it is
their decision how much (if any) grant
is to be awarded. Since each L E A acts
differently, geographical inequality also
occurs.
Most grant-receiving students are liable
to parental contributions, as assessed by
a means test. It has been estimated
that only about 2 5 % of students quali-
fying for parental contributions receive
them in full. The average parental
contribution, leaving aside students on
the minimum award of £50, is approxi-
mately £90. Evidence suggests that
students not obtaining the full parental
contribution receive on average some
5 0 % of this figure in cash and kind.
Only students with parents having a
"residual income" (after allowances) of
less than £1,100 get the full grant with-
out deduction from their L E A , and they
pay £1 for every £10 they earn over this.
A n d , of course, parents lose 10% of
any pay rise they may get.
That is a thumb-nail sketch of the
grants situation. Grants have lost £80 in
value since 1971 in London.
Married women are very much the
poor relations of their spinster counter-
parts. A n d even they are better off
than students in F . E . colleges. M a n y
students in all sectors are losing money
through the parental means test.
The N U S , hardly surprisingly, has
thus decided to mount a campaign to
change the situation.
