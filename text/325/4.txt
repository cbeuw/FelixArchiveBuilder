Sir,
My letter "Sir, Up Yours"
did not attain the impact I
expected it to. The reason is
simple. I wrote four letters
to Felix, asked you if you
were printing them and you
said yes. I'm afraid I could
call you a liar, or at best
short sighted. I remind you
you that the four letters were
on one piece of paper, so I
think it hardly likely that you
lost one. The third and most
important letter ran thus:—
"Why are there 1000 cop-
ies (out of a total 2000 print-
ed) of the Christmas issue of
Felix still in the Felix office
in four bundles of 250 from
Baileys, the printers. Also
250 copies of each of
four other editions of last
term's Felix. Total cost to the
Union—£90."
I see from the line spacing
on the Letters Page, that you
weren't exactly tight for
space in the Letter column.
I therefore would like to
point out, if not to you then
to the rest of the, readership,
that my letter 'Sir, Up Yours'
appeared "slightly" out of
context.
For once, I admire your
magnanimity in listening to a
reader's views i.e.: "Jobrot".
I hope you will pay equal at-
tention to readers who re-
quest its continuation.
I remain, HMJS.

Sir,
I feel compelled to write
in support of Mr. Parker's let-
ter. Just think of all those
unemployed. Perhaps if we
were all as public spirited
as Ron we would see the
solution staring us in the
face. All that is required is
for every student in the coun-
try to have his own personal
cleaner, valet and gentle-
man's gentleman. Mr. Brad-
bury, how could you be so
thoughtless? I only feel a
little disappointed that the
Union decided not to have a
rent strike. With all that ex-
tra money we could all em-
ploy our own manservant (or
maid perhaps). Just think, all
the unemployed swallowed
up, at a stroke (whoops!).
I look forward in eager an-
ticipation to Mr. Parker's
forthcoming announcement
that he will forego his next
few pay rises so that the col-
lege can afford to employ
more cleaners. Congratula-
tions in advance, Mr. Parker,
O.B.Es. have been won for
less than that.
Yours sincerely,
Kim Warren.

It was with great distress
that I heard of the proposed
termination of that well loved
serial "Phosphorous the Job-
rot and Ferocious Din". I
have followed the serial av-
idly and consider that it must
go down in literary history as
being a classic. Its style is
reminiscent of the great Sing-
halese writer Abalan Mats-
ridaxxiovy. As we all know
he founded the great Bombay
School of Literature. Other
eminent authors belonging to
this worthy group included
Richard F. Hungstein whose
"Malayan Mysteries" was
widely read at the turn of the
century and is now as a set
book in Eire, and Luigi Lun-
ettes, who coined the phrase
Monty Python, and Herbert
Westcott Dabbe, who died
tragically at the tender age of
three when struck on the
head by a passing porcelain,
early neolithic lavatory cis-
tern. Pondering over the per-
plexities preoccupying the
petty and puerile puny and
pathetic past president of
that Priceless Princely Public
body Guilds I became quite
paranoic, Paul, Piss off
please.
Much more serious how-
ever is the effect the loss of
this article would have on
my dear friend Frederick
(alais Mary) Ponsoby Smy-
the. I need not tell you who
he is, but when "Men Only"
was seized he suffered acute
wthdrawal symptoms which
he only recovered from when
he took up making minestrone
soup out of the collected
remnants of the article cop-
ies of the recipe were pub-
lished in the 1918 edition
T h e L a n d s n a p p e r S n e e z e
of "Boys own World" fifth
edition.
Anyway must scrub the
ceiling.
Yours,

Sir,
We view with deep con-
cern your published propos-
als regarding the discontinu-
ation of Phosphorous the
Jobrot and Ferocious Din.
We feel that the deep and
lasting psychological effects
of this decision on the great-
er part of the student populus
cannot be ignored. We there-
fore take this opportunity to
point out the folly of this
action requesting that you re-
appraise the situation and
publish the remaining four
episodes.
Your failure to do so can
only result in a prolonged
suspense, culminating in the
eventual total breakdown and
decay of society as we know
it today.
Yours worried,
P. J. Jeans
C. J. Lewis
S. F. Moult
C. W. F. Lamont.
Space
wasting
Sir, — / whole-heartedly
agree with the suggestion to
remove Phosphorous the
Jobrot and Ferocious Din
(PJFD) from Felix. I cannot
but feel however that this
will only highlight the lack
of material that the paper
has.
A few calculations reveal
this week, 159 sq. ins. or
one complete page of PJFD,
and in very small print "Ad-
vertising Feature" followed
by 108 sq. ins. of Life Assur-
ance — surely we have en-
ough forms of Life Assur-
ance stuffed down our
throats through letter racks,
etc., without Felix jumping
on the bandwagon? There is
another 62 sq. ins. of adver-
tising, so altogether well
over a page of advertising. I
realise financially advertise-
ments are necessary, but in
such profusion?
Landsnapper Sneeze
seems to have grown and
now takes up i page and
finally a 10 sq. ins. block on
the culture page announces
"Felix Culture" where surely
the 16 sq. in. of film review
if reduced to single spacing
could have gone?
In fact with a little re-
arrangement and the removal
of the above we are left with
4 sides of Felix (of which 7
articles are double-spaced)
plus Felix Diary — the most
useful part of the paper.
Surely if Felix could be
produced with less pages it
would be more economical?
I expect that with the return
of Sports Page the paper will
again grow and all the bet-
ter, but referring again to
this week, wouldn't we
rather have quality than
quantity of newsprint and
have a compact Felix rather
than one which appeared to
be trying hard to find make-
shift articles?
Yours sincerely

"Students
are not
Workers"
Sir,— Last week's Felix
editorial showed a complete
misunderstanding of the
three slogans quoted:
"Solidarity with the work-
ers"
"Workers and students for
the struggle"
"Workers and students ag-
ainst the state"
Marxists analyse society
by arguing that there are two
classes within capitalism
which have a direct relation-
ship to the means of produc-
tion workers (those people
who enter into a wage agree-
ment with their employer on
their ability to do work) and
capitalists (employers who
buy the commodity the wor-
ker sells, i.e. ability to
work). The rest of society
(including students) are not
directly related to the means
of production, so are neither
capitalists or workers. Stu-
dents represent a transient
section of our society, most
of whom will tomorrow ob-
tain or expect to obtain the
'plum' jobs in our society.
Marxists argue (which his-
tory very much substanti-
ates) that the motor of social
change is the balance of
class forces, i.e. the strength
of organised labour against
the owners of the means of
production.
The working class is the
only progressive class (the
other class — the capitalists
— cannot be, as no ruling
class in history has ever ad-
vocated fundamental social
change within its society so
as to dispossess itself from
power). In a real sense
there is no third class for, in
the last analysis, the middle
class (that unorganised sec-
tion of privileged workers
and small business men)
are confined in the other two
classes.
Hence the above slogans
crystallise these ideas with
students should side with
the most progressive class in
the class struggle and at
same time to combat the
machinery of the state (the
Army, police force, prisons
and places of coercion, etc.)
which, under the pretence of
working in the interests of
society at large, in the final
analysis defends the status
quo and upholds the old
order.
In the interests of brevity
I will refrain from com-
menting on any other mis-
conceptions in the article.
JOCK ME ALL
P.S. How are "well-educated
gentlemen like us" going to
obtain any substantial grant
increase by showing how
"reasonable" we are? Per-
haps the Tories might make
exception to a section of
"well-behaved" students to
the wage freeze! Note the
success of those "well-
behaved fellows" in White-
hall!
