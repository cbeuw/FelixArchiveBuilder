" S O N G A N D D A N C E M A N — t h e art
of B o b D y l a n "
by M i c h a e l Gray
(Hart-Davis M a c G i b b o n , £2.50)
M i c h a e l G r a y is twenty-five, he is not
a folk music fanatic, nor a hippy, and
says he is neither American nor a pro-
fessional academic. Thus he stands a
fair chance of having written something
interesting. I like Bob D y l a n — o n rec-
ord, but even so this book makes a brave
attempt to put some real thoughts into
those magically candid photographs on
L . P . covers. It tries to show where those
magical words from "Tonight I'll be
staying here with y o u " come f r o m —
" T h r o w my ticket out the window,
Throw my suitcase out there too,
T h r o w my troubles out the door,
I don't need them any more,
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here
with y o u . "
M r . G r a y tries very successfully to
show where this magnificent performer
gets his energy, his dynamism and,
above all, his poetry from. T think he
manages to hold the reader's attention
by carefully interposing snatches of
song between his statements, by calling
on the comments of others and by
charting Dylan's evolution from his very
beginning to the mass media product he
has become. The book shows the influ-
ence people like Holly, Presley, Ritchie
Valens and most important of all the
atmosphere of Nashville had on Bob
Dylan.
It is sometimes quite easy to lose the
lyrics i n a song sung by Dylan, but when
they are before you on the page there
is no mistaking the simplicity and
beauty.
" A l l the tired heroes" is an excellent
example—a no voice Dylan and an
ultra-simple lyric leaves us with a three-
line song:
' A l l the tired horse on the sun
H o w ' m I s'posed to get any riding
done?
M m — m m — m m — m m . . .'
The book is really finished off with
full details of all Dylan's work and a
complete catalogue of his albums—
including bootleg ones.

" B r i l l i a n t " , K u b r i c k at his best", " A
Masterpiece" screamed a l l the critics
here and i n New Y o r k , hustling and
jostling each other foor superlatives, all,
that is, except the film critic of the
"Village V o i c e " who with great per-
ception and critical analysis drew our
attention to the only aspect of film-
making in which one can say K u b r i c k
is brilliant — K u b r i c k the technician.
In such a capacity K u b r i c k merits every
accolade so far accorded to him, witness
the mind-blowing sets and scenes in
" 2 0 0 1 " which he also directed. Likewise
" C l o c k w o r k Orange" is a treat to the
eye, for K u b r i c k has the ability and
imagination, coupled with capacity for
physical detail, that makes the infra-
structure of the futuristic films he has
made a perfect extrapolation of present
day trends.
O n the surface " C l o c k w o r k Orange"
is the tale (based o n the book by A n -
thony Burgess) of the leader of a bunch
of "super-skinheads", set ten, maybe
twenty years i n the future, grotesque
in their white trousers and shirts with
bloodied eyeballs sewn to the cuffs and
huge fibreglass jock-straps worn out-
side their jeans, they indulge i n "ultra-
violence" with the passive, the weak and
the frightened. Speaking i n a slang de-
veloped mainly from Russian words they
beat upon old dosser and a rival gang
"indulging in a bit of the old in-outs",
before the leader played by M a l c o l m
M c D o w e l l (who was also in "IF") re-
tires home for the evening of listening
to his beloved Beethoven.
One day, however, M c D o w e l l , looking
for ultra-violence in a break-in of the
"cat-women's" house (an ageing leotar-
ded cat-lover) hits her over the head
with an enormous plaster penis and kills
her accidentally. Caught and sentenced
to prison, he becomes an angelic pri-
soner as the only way to get out, mean-
while, the government is looking for
volunteers for its new cure for criminals
and M c D o w e l l agrees to this treatment,
which is based on the axiom that too
much of a good thing starts to pall. H e
is forced to watch endless scenes of rape
and violence with background music of
Beethoven's 9th until he is physically
nauseated by any thought of his pre-
vious hobbies.
H e is then released and rejected from
his home, (his parents let his room and
can't throw the new lodger out just
'cos he comes back unexpectedly), he
roams the streets of London, a tearful
figure of pathos, not understanding why
he is ostracised for committing crimes
which, as far as his new personality
goes, were committed by another per-
son.
H e ends up in the house of an author
he once crippled by kicking his stomach
in while dancing to "Singing i n the
R a i n " . During an orgy of "ultra-vio-
lence" he is locked in a room with the
9th at full volume and feeling nauseous
to the point of suicide he jumps from
the 2nd storey window and arrives in
hospital to be congratulated and spoon-
fed by the prime-minister, obsequiously
grovelling to the television cameras, on
the success of the cure and his return to
"normality".
It is in the seemingly schizophrenic
combination of opposites that this film
has its main impact — t h e ultra-violence
and Beethoven, the nice young man and
the pathological case in our body, the
sickness and sadism of the scene of the
crippling of the author coupled with the
lighthearted humour of kicking h i m in
time to singing "Singing in the R a i n "
which made almost all the audience
laugh.
No, it is in dealing with people and
society that K u b r i c k is a non-starter;
in " 2 0 0 1 " the characters were in a com-
pletely changed environment and yet
their society was identical with the pre-
sent one, he had made no predictions
and answered no questions, indeed not
even asked any, about the form of soci-
ety in 2001. Although he has attempted
to show possible present trends in Clock-
work Orange, it is on a vague and
confused basis that he has done so,
and all the (albeit little) satire in Bur-
gess' book has been lost.
One is left with a feeling of exploita-
tion, of lack of fulfilment after this
film, for it is all too obviously just
another money-winner of the giant film
industry with its sex, violence, and hints
of seatalogical humour. But what ans-
wer can one give to the man who, com-
ing out of the cinema after seeing Clock-
work Orange, while I was queueing to
go i n , said to me " M a n , if you don't
appreciate that film, you sure don't ap-
preciate A r t " .
A L A S D H A I R C A M P B E L L .
The best reason for going to see Peter
Ustinov's " T h e U n k n o w n Soldier and
his W i f e " (New London Theatre) is to
see the theatre in which it resides, for
the New London Theatre is the first new
West E n d theatre for about thirty
years. It really is a very impressive
building, with a fine curved auditorium,
a very adaptable stage (thanks to Sean
Kenny), comfortable bars, an escalator,
a restaurant, car park, shop space and
council flats all included.
Inevitably the first production in such
surroundings is slightly disappointing—
as were the first productions of the
National Theatre, the Shaw and the
Y o u n g V i c in their time. Perhaps the
cause lies in the mutual nervousness of
the cast and the audience. The play is a
series of episodes in the history of war-
fare, with similar characters appearing
in each episode—the two antagonists,
the U n k n o w n Soldier, his wife, the
Archbishop (Peter Ustinov complete,
initially, with U L U scarf), the soldiers,
O l d Uncle T o m Cobley and all. Each
time the U n k n o w n Soldier gets called
up, leaving his pregnant wife, and gets
killed in turn fighting for the Romans,
the Crusaders, the Puritans, the French
aristocracy, and the Somme.
The problem with the play is that it
falls fatally between the stools of good
humour and pathos, for dialogue like
"I saw .you last at Colossus, didn't I ? "
"Yes, I think so" said with grave sever-
ity fits badly with some of the superb
comedy created by, for instance, the
perennial Inventor who, with the A r c h -
bishop, always comes through the con-
flict on top. There is so much that is
good, that the flaws are dreadfully
highlighted, and the actors playing the
Unknown Soldier and his Wife are seen
to be colourless and pallid beside the
other characters.
M u c h of the play is funny, and the
intended, and rather facile, dramatic
points are trotted out well enough.—
the Church changing its position as the
wind blows, the paradox of the chivalry
between leaders against the cruelty of
the war itself, the changeless nature of
warfare with its unthinking soldiery.
These points emerge, but there is none
of the humorous strength of " O h ! What
a Lovely W a r " , nor the convicting
savagery of Brecht or Brook's " U S " .
The play is just a rather pale image of
what it might have been.
In fact, it's just the sort of play to
open a new West E n d theatre. Come
back Peter Brook, l o a n Littlewood,
Bertholt Brecht—all is forgiven.
B O B C A R T E R
Island of the Mighty
L i k e L o n g Day's Journey into Night;
this play is 3} hours long; however,
Island of the Mighty is weak, seem-
ingly incoherent, and deadly dull.
The subject of much controversy,
what with the Irish authors (Alden
and D'Arcy) objecting to the set, pro-
duction, music and a l l — I came away
with the view that, were I the author,
I'd dissociate myself from the play,
too!
Set on an essentially bare stage, the
legend of K i n g A r t h u r is (supposedly)
given new dimensions. A r t h u r is an old,
decrepit cripple left by Rome to fend
off invading English. H e has a rag-tag
pseudo-Roman legion, but spends more
time coping with wild, marauding Brit-
ish bands than fighting English. A great
deal of the play's time is, in fact, taken
up by Wildcat Worshippers; only at the
end does this make sense, and then only
little. Merlin, here a poet, spends his
time cavorting with fellow sages; his end
is strange. But then, I consider the whole
play strange.
The three acts are of almost equal
70 minute length. After the first, I was
totally bewildered, sensing no direction
to the action. The second seemed un-
related to the previous; only i n the last
act is it tied, however loosely, together.
The action, or lack thereof, set a new
low water mark, in my opinion, for
the R o y a l Shakespeare Company. They
tried gallantly, i n an excellent attempt
to bring life into the corpse. They failed
appallingly.
A m o n g M s . D'Arsy's many criticisms
was the music. I found the unusual score
interesting and refreshing; it alone liv-
ened the dead play enough to keep me
from walking out of the old, cold,
draughty A l d w y c h Theatre along with
a hundred or so others.
If you sympathize with the author's
fight, you will want to boycott this play;
if you want to see a good play, you will
want to miss this. In either case,
avoid it.
