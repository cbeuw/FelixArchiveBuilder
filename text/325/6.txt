It seems that a large proportion of
R.C.S. enthusiasts and guildstwats are
unaware of the active rivalry that took
place, more or less continuously,
throughout last term, between the unions
of these two constituent colleges. So i n
the Broadsheet opinion column, this
time folks, I thought I'd relate the saga
of friendly (?) rivalry actively portrayed
by the dubious antics of factions from
R.C.S. and guilds.
Well, it all started one afternoon when
a herd of guildstwats attired for some
outdoor sporting activity or other
stormed into the R.C.S.U. office, made
various mumblings and groanings (not
entirely dissimilar to a herd of Gumbies
reading out the telephone directory —
well attempting -to pronounce the first
word in the directory), and then wan-
dered off again. Shortly after their de-
parture a keen-eyed member of the
R.C.S. exec, noted the union office sign
that used to prop up the corner of the
office was mising. A t once a deadening
hush fell upon the assembled multitude
when the devastating horror of it came
home — I T H A D J U S T ( B E E N
N I C K E D !
Revenge was called for, and a couple
of days later the R.C.S. Revenge Squad
M k . I returned the compliment of a n
inter-collegiate union office visit a n d
not being able to find our office sign
(the cowardly guildstwats not having
dared to store it in their office i n M e -
chanical Engineering), they returned
with a large " L o n d o n W a x Works
M u s e u m " notice board that had been
filched during the filming of " O u t
Damned Spot!" (see a past Broadsheet
for review of events) i n Prince Consort
Road. Pretty this notice was not, how-
ever it was some form of trophy now
and so lay gathering dust i n our office
for some weeks until a second large
squad of guildstwats repossessed it on
the night of the R.C.S. Smoking Concert,
there not being many people i n the
office at the time as just about everyone
of course was at the Concert. ( A n d a
splendid event it was too).
Once again revenge was called for and
so the R.C.S. Revenge Squad M k . II, i n
the form of a solitary masked figure
gained access to the guilds office and
still not being able to find our office
sign decided to relieve guilds of a col-
lection of half a dozen flashy yellow
plastic shields. Five of these then
adorned our hallowed shrine for some
time during which we were paid curious
visits from individual guilds personages
who were still trying to work out h o w
they had lost the shields.
N o w one quiet lunchtime our hard-
working duplicating officer was bringing
vast quantities of paper into the office
all on 'is tod. This paper having been
ordered for us by a M r . O. Dowson was
all the wrong colour, but be that as it
may, some observant guildgumbies saw
their opportunity, and despite the brave
efforts of our gallant reproducing
chappie, managed to retrieve their
shields.
Y u p ! Y o u guessed it, R.C.S. Revenge
Squad M k . II, i n the late hours one
night got into the guilds office and found
it even more smelly than usual. A c t i n g
on a hunch they began a search for the
inebriated body of tariq (guilds vice-
pres.) but soon found the
source of the obnoxious stench
to be the puny collection of
rotting M o r p h y D a y fruit guilds h a d
stored in one corner. O u r lads being
in a benevolent mood decided to re-
move this muck from guilds office and
left only a small amount behind. N o w
it seems guilds didn't want this either
since it was found the following morning
in a heap i n front of our office door.
Threats were also issued that if their
fruit was not returned the R.S.C. office
would (in the usual elegant and sophisti-
cated style so often associated with
guilds "be done over by o u r
lads like". N o w since a
carnival committee meeting was
due to be held at 1.00 this was a n i n -
teresting state of affairs. T h e meeting
was held elsewhere at the last minute
and those of you who wondered w h y
a crowd of gum hie impersonators were
staggering about Southside on M o r p h y
Day, swaying their arms and groaning
"there's nobody there!" now know the
full story.
More developments, if and when they
happen, i n future Broadsheet/Felix
columns folks. See you in a couple of
weeks. R O N A P P L E B Y
