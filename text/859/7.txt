The RSMU are the Pits
Last week's edition of 'PIT', the Royal School of Mines
(RSM) newsletter strongly re-affirmed the RSM's
appalling reputation in its attitude to women.
This is not an attack on PIT's editorial group, this
article aims to illustrate the chauvinism of the RSM,
why the way in which women in the RSM are
perceived is wrong and why both men and women
found PIT offensive.
PIT's page three had a picture of a woman lying
naked on a beach-the caption read 'She's waiting
for it'. The implication is obvious and should be
thought through. The message was clear-if you are
female and you are nude it is a clear invitation for sex.
If you think a woman sunbathing naked on the beach
is asking for sex, then do you think a woman wearing
a short skirt is asking to be raped? And do you think
that if your mother/sister/girlfriend is out late at night
alone she is asking to be attacked? If you accept even
the first of these scenarios it is indicative of the way
you perceive women.
Women and men are sexual beings, but women are
not just sexual beings-they are not sexual objects.
The picture on the beach showed women in a very
submissive light, it showed a woman as an object, as
just a receptacle for sex.
I do not find all images of nude women offensive-
only those showing women in submissive roles would
I call pornographic. As in the world outside Imperial,
much has been made of the fact that men too feature
in pornography. In last week's edition of PIT, in
perhaps an attempt to disarm those who would
criticise the three pictures of women either nude or
semi-nude, two pictures of nude men were also
included. One picture was a back view of a bronzed,
muscle clad male. The image was one of strength and
control-unlike the woman on the beach-this human
being appeared in no way submissive and indeed was
not shown in a particularly sexual light. The picture
held much respect for the subject, unlike that of the
woman with its accompanying caption 'She's waiting
for it'. The comparison is clear. The inclusion of the
male nude in an attempt to balance or excuse the
female nude only served to further underline the
difference between the perception of male and
female. The female is submissive, the male is all
powerful.
I felt deeply offended by the use of pornography in
PIT. Why is it that some women appeared not in the
least bothered by the newsletter? Within the RSM the
'traditions' of beer swilling, pornographic songs and
a uniquely offensive departmental newsletter go
unchallenged. Within the undergraduate population
the pressure to conform to these 'traditions' is strong
for both men and women. Women who are not
offended by, for example PIT, have, of course, a right
to that view. I question the foundations on which
these views are based. Women are in a minority in the
department and are thus more vulnerable. I believe
that for women to accept the uniquely chauvinistic
atmosphere of the RSM is the result of a natural wish
to be accepted - t o be part of their department. I ask
these women to stop and think what they are
accepting in a personal sense and in the sense of their
whole gender.
The male chauvinist atmosphere within the RSM is
not just offensive to women but to men also
Chauvinism is not just about a negative attitude to
women, it is about the pressure on men to conform
to a male ideal. What gives the RSM sports officers
the right to pressurise sportsmen not to play for their
College but only to play for their Union. RSM is
synonymous with excessive, mindless drinking. RSM
bar nights only further affirm the ethos; 'The best
shape for a miner is to be in is a beer barrel.'
Why is chauvinism within the RSM so strong? Is it
because of the macho image of 'geology'-is this
macho image justifiable? How many graduates will
ever actually do the ultimate macho thing and dig a
mine? Very few I suspect. There is a strong sense that
hand-in-hand with the pressure to conform is the
feeling: it's not what you do as much as who you
know, that really counts. This is an illusion. The B in
BSc does not stand for beer and bravado.
The chauvinism of the RSM is archaic. It is deeply
offensive to both men and women. The patterns of
behaviour regularly displayed within the department
are those of a time long gone by. The year is 1990
not 1890. Friday's De La Beche (DLB) Society lecture
was on seismicity. The poster, a 'seismic trace' of a
female nude. A DLB Officer when asked how he
thought the professor giving the lecture would feel if
he knew of the publicity issued on his behalf replied
'We're going to take them all down before he sees
them'. The RSM is ashamed and knows it is wrong.
