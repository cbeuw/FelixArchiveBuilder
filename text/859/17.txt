Afro-Caribbean Society
On reflection, I regret the inclusion of the phrase 'Afro-
Carib Drug Frenzy' in last week's Whats On. I have
apologised to the society and its members in a letter
and there is a formal apology in the whats on page
this week. I have no regrets over the news story or
editorial, however.
This week's FELIX contains a number of letters on
the subject of the Afro-Caribbean Disco and its
coverage in FELIX. I accept some of the points
contained within them but not all of them. I found the
views of A Jegede and B Brito disturbing. To say that
people should hand in their valuables if they go to an
Afro-Caribbean Disco or they will pay 'the
consequences' is tantamount to condoning mugging.
A group which organises an event is responsible for
the safety of those attending. A Jegede and B Brito
have shown an irresponsible attitude which I find
abhorent and beneath contempt.
The President of Afroc has taken a blind-eyed
approach to the subject. He still refuses to condemn
the violence at the event in question and seems happy
to deny that anything illegal ever took place. Now he
has used this week's International Night as a chance
for blackmailing the Union into allowing further room
bookings for Afroc. Afro-Caribbean Society
threatened to pull out of International Night last Friday
and have been out to get all they can from the
situation ever since. The Union is wrong to have
backed down in this way. There will be an Afro-
Caribbean Disco at International night, tonight but
Union Card checks will be enforced.
Harlington
It is a long time since the conniving git award was
made. This week has seen the honour fall upon Sir
Eric Ash for the third time. I now intend to acquire a
small trophy and have it engraved. As a three times
winner, Sir Eric will now have the honour of keeping
the award.
Sir Eric has seen fit to try and dip his hands into the
Harlington Trust for the purposes of residences. It
would seem that he has made a deal with the Dean
of St Mary's with money which belongs to the
students of Imperial College Union. Of course, his
memory is blurred on the exact details (his age you
know), but it seems that the students at St Mary's
have offered £ '/a million towards the cost of a new
hall. Well that's what Prof Richards said, or something
like that. Funnily enough, it's not what the St Mary's
student Union said. I just wish I had the power to play
around with so much of other people's money.
The question of the hockey pitches at Harlington
may be related to this. Perhaps a stop has been placed
on the plans to help pay for this new hall. What is
certain is that Imperial College's Hockey players will
not have anywhere to play next year. The quotes
obtained by the college now seem to be for a new
Wembley Stadium at Harlington, rather than an
Astroturf pitch. Either the College has employed a two
year old clown who can't count to obtain quotes for
this work, or they have obtained excessively high
quotes in order to stop work going ahead on the new
pitch. At present, the College is in credit at the bank
because of funds like the Harlington trust. Now they
seem eager to realise these assets before it is too late.
Letters
Last week's issue contained a letter from 'Rachel
Stone.' The letter, which criticised the news coverage
in FELIX was accepted in good faith through the
internal mail. Ms Stone came into FELIX on Friday to
explain that the letter was not from her. At present,
FELIX trusts people to put their own name on letters.
Whoever the spineless shit was who sent the letter;
you didn't bother me, but you upset Rachel, I hope
you're happy.
Sabbatical Elections
I hope that this year's candidates have read the
deadlines for publicity production. Copies are available
from the wallet by the papers on the stairway to the
Union Office. So far it seems that a lot of people are
not planning on much in the way of publicity. This is
great by me, since I have to arrange production and
printing. Keep up the disorganisation folks!
