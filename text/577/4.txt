The Definitive Guide
to Farting
As a new year starts and Moonie
rummages through the dustbins of
S o u t h K e n s i n g t o n l o o k i n g for
i n s p i r a t i o n , many people are
d i s c o v e r i n g the e m b a r r a s s i n g
rectal explosions that inevitably
follow a Southside or Refectory
meal. Whilst some may consider
this a devastating faux pas, others
prefer this organic form of non-
verbal communication to ordinary
conversation; in fact, the Rector
has made a career out of it.
There are of course many differ-
ent types of fart. The Morse Fart
requires strict sphincter control
and years of practise amongst
d e v o t e e s , a n d s h o u l d not be
confused peeps and squeaks of an
ill-concealed fart emanating from
the tightly clasped cheeks of an
amateur.
The SBD (Silent But Deadly) is the
inevitable conclusion to lingering
afterburn from a previous Moonie
beef risotto. Powerful enough to
paralyse a skunk at fifty paces, it
ranks with bestiality, flagellation,
and IC Ents as the lowest form of
human existence. A n ill wind may
blow good however; whilst waiting
endlessly for photocopy ingmachines
in the L y o n P l a y i a i r L i b r a r y ,
dropping one's guts will not only
shorten the waiting list but might
also clear a path to the delectable
Janice at the check-out counter.
One word ol warning though — to
avoid suspicion always be the first
to sniff the air briefly and then
exlaim loudly "Strewth, someone's
really dropped a brick!".
The Postern Blast is the piece de
r e s i s t a n c e of f a r t i n g , a n d is
commonly caused by drinking
Stan's Sam Smiths without sterilis-
ing it in Detol beforehand. II
performed correctly it will bring
rapturous applause from cog-
nescenti and a writ from the Noise
Abatement Society. Refrain from
carrying out this manoeuvre in
confined spaces, for although the
Postern Blast is totally devoid of
odour, it can perforate the eardrum
of the unsuspecting. It is also
advisable to wear reinforcements
on the backs of trousers, and
nearby windows should be taped
over or covered with a net curtain.
Nonetheless the Postern Blast can
be a favourite party trick, such as
blowing out birthday cake candles,
or igniting the wind and making a
sheet of flame scorch out across the
wallpaper.
One of the more distressing farts
is the Wet One (also known as
'dropping coconuts'). Often caused
by pre-exam stress, or the anticipa-
tion of a nurses disco, the Wet One
is difficult to prevent, but the more
embarassing side effects can be
minimised by wearing absorbent
underwear. Persistent farting of
this nature may need medical
attention, or a good sized cork
bung.
So there we have it — love it or
leave it, the fart is no passing phase,
and should be appreciated in all its
glory. But until the social stigma of
letting rip is overcome, the fart will
r e m a i n the b r e e z y secret of
hundreds of devotees.
