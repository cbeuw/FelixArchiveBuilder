Contemptable little snot-rag
I see that 23,000 g r a d u a t e s of L o n d o n
University with brains positively bulging with
three years of higher education have seen fit to
elect a stupid stuck-up little bitch whose only
education has been on the back of a horse as
Chancellor.
W h i l e I c o n c e d e that the c h o i c e for
Chancellor left a lot to be desired, electing
Princess Anne (a woman with the intellect of a
cabbage and ability of a slug) devalues any
degree obtained through the University.
Why didn't someone as gifted and sensitive
as Lord Flowers stand for election.

Come and see prospective sabba-
ticals make promises they're bound
to keep. Don't forget, an informed
vote is a right vote.
Students at Primelia College have to manage
on a grant, just like the rest of us, so it was
h a r d l y s u r p r i s i n g that four e n g i n e e r i n g
s t u d e n t s i n n e e d of an e v e n i n g ' s h e a v y
drinking found they could only afford one
cylindrical can of beer between them.
Not having any kind of measuring vessel,
they shared it out in the following way.
They started by removing the circular top of
the can. Next, they tilted the can until the level
of beer came to halfway down the inside of the
tilted can. All the beer which was poured out of
the can during the operation was caught in a
glass and given to the first student.
The can was then tilted until the beer level
just reached the bottom of the tilted can; again
the beer poured out was caught in a glass, and
this was handed to the second student.
Then they tilted the can again, this time until
the level came to halfway down the circular
bottom of the can. This measured the third
student's share, and of course the last student
drank what was left in the can.
It doesn't take very long for an engineer to
drink that much beer, so they had plenty of
time a n d sufficient sobriety to consider
whether the beer had been divided fairly, and if
not, what proportion each had received. C a n
you help them?
Solutions, comments and criticisms to me
c/o FEUX Office. There is a prize of £5
(donated by Mend-a-Bike) for the correct
entry randomly selected at 1:00pm on
Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution
Mrs F to H , Mrs G to I, M r s H to G and Mrs I
to F.
This week's prizewinner is Say Wei Foo,
Elec Eng P G who can collect his prize from the
F E L I X Office.
In the past, we have paid prizewinners out of
petty cash, and this has often meant that
prizewinners have had to keep calling at the
office until there is enough money in the cash
b o x to pay t h e m . I'm s o r r y a b o u t any
embarrassment caused by this; in future there
wil be a cheque payable to the prizewinner
available on the Monday afternoon after the
solution is published.
Each week in this column I invite "Solutions,
comments and criticisms." I always publish
the solution, so this week I felt it would be fun
to publish the comments and criticisms I
received.
" . . . seems easy to me, judged by the
standard of recent puzzles . . ."
"I've probably got this wrong, can't you
make up some easy ones?"
" A 'nice' puzzle."
"Doesn't seem very difficult — have I made
a mistake?"
"Five minutes in lecture. If this isn't trivial
what is?"
"If you substitute 'slept with' for 'received a
Valentine from', it sounds like an evening at
H P H . . ."
So you see what I have to put up with.
Where's H P H ?
