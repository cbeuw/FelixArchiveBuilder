Dear Steve
In your editorial last week you
o f f e r e d t h e v i e w t h a t w i t h
education of the general public
on matters nuclear (presumably
along the lines of 'Protest and
Survive'), a nuclear war need not
have the horrific consequences
depicted in 'The W a r Game'.
O n this matter, the Minister of
State for H o m e Affairs estimated
( M a r c h 16, 1980) that following
the measures set out in 'Protest
and Survive' might reduce the
death toll (in "the sort of nuclear
attack which we think we can
expect") from 40m to 25m.
In addition to this, shortages of
uncontaminated food and water;
destruction of energy supplies
a n d s a n i t a t i o n ; m i g r a t i o n of
desperate refugees; would result
in violence, disease epidemics,
and perhaps starvation — more
deaths and mass misery.
Thus, whilst education on civil
defence is of vital importance, it
is a d a n g e r o u s d e c e p t i o n to
b e l i e v e t h a t it c o u l d e n s u r e ,
anything but a shattered and
brutal existence for those remain-
ing.
Tragically, the government's
present utterances on the subject
attempt to hush people into a
resigned acceptance of nuclear
w a r , a n d t h e i r ' c i v i l defence'
preparations have more to do
with maintaining martial law,
than saving lives.
A s ever, the only insurance
against the effects of nuclear war
is never to have such a war.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
O n Thursday, February 12, I
a t t e n d e d the M o p s o c l e c t u r e
given by D r M a g n u s Pyke on the
"Understandability of Science"
Approximately twenty minutes
into the talk I noticed that the
person in front of me appeared to
be writing a report on what D r
Pyke was saying. Being naturally
curious I read some of it and
concluded that it was factually
accurate but very badly struc-
tured.
O n Friday I read the F E L I X
lead article which was exactly the
same report I had seen being
written during the talk. I will
repeat that lor emphasis written
D U R I N G the t a l k . T h i s is
extremely bad practice and a
reading of the article reveals it to
be an appalling piece of reporting
characterized by adjacent sen-
tences which have absolutely no
relation to each other. The piece
did not appear to have been
revised or rewritten and it seerm
questionable if it had ever been
r e r e a d b y t h e i n c o m p e t e n t
reporter who wrote, nay hacked,
this piece of illiterate drivel.
If your newspaper can do no
better than publish such verbal
garbage as the main article of the
week then I humbly suggest that
it gives up all such reporting and
confine itself to the puerile gossip
c o l u m n s m o r e suited to y o u r
reporter's prose style.
Tours sincerely

Dear Sir
Included in F E L I X 577 was a
letter written by myself and three
others, which you credited to
R u t h H i l d e b r a n d only. Perhaps
one has to be a ' U n i o n person-
ality' to have a letter published in
F E L I X , or would the inclusion of
two other names have ruined the
effect of your snide editorial note?

Dear Sir
I am writing against the R o y a l
School of M i n e s being allowed to
put on their "adult entertain-
m e n t " o n I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
ground. Both women and men
a t t e n d this C o l l e g e a n d b o t h
should be allowed the same rights
and status. Presenting women as
mere sex objects is degrading and
insulting to the women at this
College who certainly do not
a t t e n d it i n this role. M i n e s
pointed out last year that a male
s t r i p p e r was i n c l u d e d i n the
event, which could thus not be
viewed as sexist. However, from a
W I S T survey previous the event
last year, we found out that the
audience was very predominatly
male and the male stripper was
considered as a " b i t of a joke".
W e are well aware that the
men to women ratio is rather
large but would like to suggest
t h a t t h i s p r o b l e m w i l l n o t
diminish if I C continues to offer
services which undermine the
i m a g e of w o m e n . M e n w h o
cannot cope with the problem on
a personal basis should go and
get r i d o f t h e i r f r u s t r a t i o n
elsewhere. After all L o n d o n is full
of o p p o r t u n i t i e s . H o w e v e r , a
w a r n i n g against this k i n d of
opportunity: it is debasing for
men to have to actually pay to
see a woman naked.
If anyone feels strongly enough
to protest against this event, they
are welcome to come and join the
picket on February 27 at 7:00pm.
Other people are invited to think
of the implications of this "adult
entertainment" and to try and
see further than being "one of the
lads". O f course, I would be very
interested in the reply of anyone
who can justify the event on
other than selfish grounds.

Dear Sir
If it only costs £10 for I C U to
affiliate to C N D ( F E L I X 576)
t h e n w h y c a n ' t we h a v e a
collection around College (which
would without doubt raise the
a m o u n t v e r y q u i c k l y ) . T h i s
would surely be a simple solution
to the ' U l t r a Vires' problem since
then the money would be coming
out of ' p e r s o n a l ' r a t h e r t h a n
'trust' funds and this would be
allowable as far as I can see from
your account of the 1972 court
case. Is it really that simple or
have I misunderstood some vital
point?
I can't help thinking that the
more militaristic and conserva-
tive members of our U n i o n are
o n l y too pleased to see such
c o m p l i c a t i o n s b l o c k i n g t h e
realization of what was after all a
U G M d e c i s i o n to affiliate to
C N D .
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
I should like to take this oppor-
t u n i t y to p u t s t r a i g h t a few
erroneous details contained in
the a r t i c l e w r i t t e n by I C M C
N e w s A g e n c y i n last w e e k ' s
F E L I X . In particular, I should
like to point out to the M o u n -
taineering C l u b that since it was
they who followed us into the
petrol station, then this would
indicate that it was S & G who
first had the idea to visit Wales,
and Mountaineering C l u b , short
of ideas, and reading F E L I X the
week before, seized on the idea
themselves, and followed us to
Wales.
Continuing to correct further
details of the article, it should be
p o i n t e d out t h a t the " p u n y
j a l o p y " was i n fact G G P , a
U n i o n m i n i b u s ( A n n i e t a k e
note), and that it had been fitted
with a new engine, and was thus
being run in. Indeed, Annie had
given explicit instructions not to
exceed 60mph, and the tacho-
graph fitted proves this to be the
case.
After what can only be des-
c r i b e d as a piece of reckless
driving in order to prove some
point in overtaking whilst other
vehicles were approaching from
the opposite direction, M o u n -
t a i n e e r i n g C l u b d i d not p u l l
away, nor did S & G give chase at
all, but rather merely continued
at a sedate pace, keeping up with
Mountaineers with perfect ease
and control. W e were, however,
surprised at their route, choosing
the A 5 instead of M 6 . W e chose
the latter, and arrived back at
the U n i o n at 12:30am. M o u n -
taineers, what were you doing?
As to the allegation of follow-
ing them, what went wrong this
weekend, or didn't you know we
went to Mendips?

The Government is at present
bulldozing through Parliament a
bill to reform Nationality L a w .
It seems that the indecent haste is
to take the minds of the faithful
off the economic position by an
appeal to primitive racism.
C i t z e n s h i p of t h e U K or
Colonies was recognised under
the 1948 N a t i o n a l i t y A c t as
conferring considerable rights on
peoples exploited by Imperial
B r i t a i n w i t h r e g a r d to future
r e l a t i o n s h i p s w i t h i n the new
Commonwealth. However the
increasing conciousness of black
immigrants in this country of
civil rights and cultural needs
being openly or tacitly denied,
a l l i e d w i t h a m i s g u i d e d a n d
misunderstood racism on the side
of many whites, has led to the
immigration acts and increasing
harrassment of blacks who are
legally present in the U K —
which is now being cynically
l e g i t i m i z e d i n a b i l l w h i c h
amounts to a policy of induced
repatriation of black people —
many of whom have served their
new adopted ;community more
than adequately.
It is proposed to introduce
three classes of citizenship —
o n l y one of w h i c h gives real
rights to residence and services in
