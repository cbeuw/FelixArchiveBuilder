Episode Eight
The local policeman, P.C. Hartley, cycled unsteadily
home. It was after all the prerogative of the
constabulary to ensure that law and order was
observed and hospitality could not, after all, be
denied. The ditch had been in the village for some
while, indeed, local historians (Brigadier and Mrs.
Charlesworth) considered that it had been a part of
the community since the Middle Ages. Whether or
not this was so, P.C. Hartley made it his unfailing
duty each evening to ride his bicycle into the ditch.
Such constancy could not long go unrewarded - but
it was.
On the train the conspicuous party had apologised,
but the air was still charged with discontent.
Really, it just was not done. Telegraph poles sped
past the window and still Aunt Deidre sat and
looked displeased. Under the seat a black beetle
crawled and cared not one whit for the conspicuous
party.
