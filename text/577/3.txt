this c o u n t r y . A c c e s s to this
'British Citzenship' is by carefully
designed, hereditary and loyaly
qualifications and effectively for
a n y o n e w i t h o u t B r i t i s h b o r n
grandparents is entirely at the
H o m e Secretary's discretion.
Hence a series of fundamental
objections to the proposals can be
made
1. By defining the classes of
c i t i z e n s h i p , access to basic
civil rights in the U K will be
c o n t r o l l e d t h r o u g h a pass
system which will inevitably
be more zealously applied to
blacks.
2. The Ancestral qualifica-
tion for citzenship and a pro-
posed difference in treatment
between even the first class
citizens who acquired the title
through naturalization or by
birth will be essentially racist
in practice.
3. T h e ill-defined principles
by which the H o m e Secretary
w i l l exercise his d i s c r e t i o n
over q u a l i f i c a t i o n for first
class citizenship will be simply
a r b i t a r y c o n t r o l o v e r the
destiny of black immigrants.
4. T h e o v e r a l l i n c r e a s e d
c o n t r o l of b l a c k s t h r o u g h
these measures pander to the
worst fascist instincts of a
minority in Britain and are
aimed at inducing repatria-
tion of black immigrants.
T h e relevance of all this to I C
students is:
a T h a t it c o u l d s e r i o u s l y
affect any C o m m o n w e a l t h
overseas students here who
may wish to- stay in the U K
after finishing.
b N o n - o p p o s i t i o n o f a n y
section of the community to
these proposals implies ac-
ceptance of and collaboration
with racism.
c Legislation like this lays the
basis for pass laws and more
and more state control of the
individual in Britain.
A l l the black organisations in
Britain are fighting the proposals.
It is the duty of everyone to join
with them and strongly demon-
strate that we condemn racism in
all its forms; and to remove this
cancer from our society for good.

H R H Princess Anne, who once
claimed that "going to university
is a much overrated pastime" is
the next Chancellor of L o n d o n
University. V o t i n g closed at the
end of last week and the result
was announced on Tuesday. The
total votes for each candidate
were Princess Anne, 23,951, Jack
Jones, 10,507, Nelson M a n d e l a ,
7,199.
This is the first time in the
U n i v e r s i t y ' s h i s t o r y that the
election has been contested. After
Princess Anne was nominated,

Packed Out
T H E R E C E N T showing of the
c o n t r o v e r s i a l f i l m " T h e W a r

this week. O n Tuesday, Physics
Lecture Theatre 1 was crowded
beyond lire regulations which
w o u l d have resulted i n some

f o u r - m i n u t e w a r n i n g h a v e
sounded. As a result of this the
film was repeated on Wednesday
and also relayed to R o o m 213 in
the Huxley Building by monitor.
" T h e W a r G a m e " was made
in 1965 and was banned by the
B B C . T h e C N D G r o u p has
organised a petition to get the
film shown on televsion.
Jones and of black nationalist
leader Nelson M a n d e l a were also
put f o r w a r d , a n d these here
caused some controversy. Jack
Jones was described by Bernard
Levin, .writing in the Times, as a
"knackered T U C workhorse", as
L e v i n declared his support for
Princess Anne. Also in the Times,
a leader article last year suggest-
ed it would be no loss of face for
Princess Anne if she lost. M a n -
dela has been in prison in South
Africa for seventeen years, but his
n o m i n a t o r s s t a t e d t h a t his
candidature was a serious one.
The position of Chancellor is
mainly formal including such
things as participating in degree
awarding ceremonies.

held earlier this week in Princess

entered the competition, and the
winners will receive a trophy for
their efforts. There were some
hair-raising incidents during the
racing, however. In one heat, a
group of school children walked
across the track, and in another a
lorry with a skip dumped its loap
in the middle of the course. T h e
peddle-car driver avoided it by
swerving into the road. However,
no one was hurt, and no damage
done.
