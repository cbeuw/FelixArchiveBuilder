To enter the Field Cup give your team's names

Camborne is now only one day away and I hope
everyone has bought their "value for money" day
tickets. The tickets cost £4.50 and includes travel
to and from Harlington with a meal and beer in
the evening. Even if you haven't a ticket come
along to the games, coaches leave 10:00am
outside R S M .
Remember only seven days to "The Mines
Review" which is at 7:30pm on February 21 in the
J C R , and if you are thinking of standing for a
Union post the papers go up on March 2.
T H E I N T E R - C C U Monopoly takes place next
Saturday commencing at 10:00am in the I C U
Office. This is a sort of treasure hunt around the
various sites on the Monopoly board. Teams of
three or four people must answer clues at each of
the sites and collect money for Rag also. Points
are won for correct answers and for money
collected. Extra points can also be gained by
having the best mascot.
The first three teams win prizes of a case of
Swan, a bottle of whisky and a bottle of wine
respectively. Alternatively winners may have the
cash equivalent.
Only public transport may be used on the
Monopoly. Tube fares cannot be refunded but the
cost of a Red Bus Rover can, if competitors
return it at the end and also collect over £3. It is
not necessary to visit all of the sites but at least
two thirds of them must have been visited if the
team is to be considered for a prize.
Monopoly provides an excellent chance to see
parts of London you wouldn't normally visit and,
incidentally, is a great deal of fun. Copies of the
rules are available from Paul Johnson in the
R C S U Office.
The other big College Rag event is the Great
Imperial College Rag Mag Race 1981 on the
weekend of March 6-8. Competitors leave the
Union Building any time after 2:00pm on the
Friday afternoon and must return to the bar by
closing time on Sunday evening. In the meantime
they travel to all parts of the country and try to
sell as many Rag Mags as possible. Prizes are
given for a) most Rags Mags sold, b) most Rag
Mags sold per hour, c) the furthest distance
travelled from IC and d) the most unusual or
original method of travel. To be considered for
any prize, competitors must have sold at least 150
Rag Mags. People can travel on their own or in
teams but prizes are awarded to individuals. Of
course, no one can win more than one prize. The
prizes for each category are a bottle of spirits and,
in the case of (a) fare refunded or a cash prize
whichever is greater. In the case of (c) adequate
proof must be provided. Entries for the race can
be made via your V P or Soc Rep. Good luck!

Thirty colour prints and fifty slides were entered
in last week's Photographic Society Competition.
The winner of the print competition was P
Minoli (Biochem) and I Hodgson (Mech Eng)
s u b m i t t e d the best s l i d e . N H u s e m was
congratulated for getting in the top three for both
B & W and colour. The judge was M r s N
Batchelor.
Photosoc have asked FELIX to encourage
members of the society to come to the New
D a r k r o o m this Sunday, at 2:00pm, to help
construct a cabinet.
Many good natured comments were made on
why the FELIX photographer had not entered the
colour competition. Mr Palmer replied that his
camera only takes black and white pictures.

J U S T A BRIEF reminder that Giles Shaw, MP,
will be in College on Tuesday, February 24, to talk
on The Last 18 Months in Northern Ireland. As
Junior Minister for N Ireland until the recent
C a b i n e t Reshuffle, he is most qualified to
comment on such controversial issues as political
status for inmates of the Maze Prison, and the
Rev Ian Paisley's "Private Army".
The meeting will take place in Room 139 of the
Huxley Building. Follow the signs from the main
foyer.
Tight Lines
A N INTREPID few of the soon to be official
Angling Club set off incredibly early to Richmond
(the advertised trip to the Serpentine was called
off — the Department of Environment is only
accepting permit applications for next season,
which will be allocated on April 1).
The lines were wetted in the Thames by eight
o'clock and what a prolific session it turned out to
be — see last week's Anglers Mail. Victor
B u t o r y s . o n his home river, was s o o n into
unexpected bream. His swim was alive for well
over an hour, the float having no time to settle
before diving at an incredible rate. Firmness on
the strike was able to ensure a thirty pound plus
bag with just ten fish.
Andrew 'We should have gone shopping'
Powell, fishing a large eddy pool, was after club in
the finest traditions of M r Crabtree (and Peter).
Legering live frog, a cunningly disguised maggot,
on 31b test line, he was to be rewarded with the
finest specimen to be seen on the Thames for
some years. At 71b it was just an ounce under the
Thames record of 88 years standing.
John 'the rivers are much cleaner in Wales,
boyo' Davies started the first in an unusual set of
experiments for Thames Water. He's after the
British R e c o r d rod Caught S a l m o n . M o s t
others would have been chuffed at his 231b 4oz
6dr pike. But not our John. Back it went just
before the photographer arrived.
Van Scott (Victor's protege) decided that he
would be an honest fisherman for the rest of his
life. Unfortunately he drew a blank on Saturday.
After such a good first meet, liquid celebration
s h o u l d have been the o r d e r of the d a y .
Unfortunately there was an hour and half left
before they opened . .. for the lunchtime session.
We hope to have some more trips in the near
future. Tentative dates are February 21, March 7
and March 14 (end season special event!); venues
have yet to be decided. Come along to our
meetings on Thursday lunchtime (12:30pm,
Southside Upper Lounge) or contact Dave
Kelsall, Chem Eng P G (room G05) to find out
more details.
ICYHA
T H E TRIPS to Beachy Head and the Peak
District both went very well, despite the lack of
the van for Beachy H e a d , and this evening
(Friday) we shall be off to Somerset, which is
followed in two weeks time, by the Lake District
weekend, where we shall be camping.
The program for the rest of the term is: March
6-8 L a k e District; M a r c h 12 A G M ; Easter
Holidays Scotland.

ICCAG
A F T E R O U R FIRST trip last week, draught-
proofing the homes of elderly people, we now
have a small core of experts, eager to pass on
their new-found skills to others. Do you have a
way with sticky tape? O r with old ladies? D o you
know the difference? Well, it really doesn't
matter. All you need is an atom of common sense
(or just "common" will do), and some free time
this Wednesday afternoon, February 25. Meet
Beit A r c h (surprise!!) at 12:30pm. A l l fares
refunded.
For more details contact Sean Coyle, Elec Eng
2, or be daring and come to our meeting on
Monday, 12:30pmish, in the I C C A G Room (top
floor Union — turn left at top of stairs and keep
going!).
