l trovatore is a classic
opera by Verdi, one
of the most regularly
performed in the operatic
repertoire today. It is the
sort of opera that has
fuelled the caricatures of the
art form – it is confusing,
extravagant, and filled with
impassioned singing, known
as much for its convoluted
plotline as for its musical
beauty.
Based on the 1836 play
El trovador, Il trovatore is
a story of high melodrama
and conflict that spans two
generations. Originally set
in Aragon in the 15th
century,
the Count di Luna is madly in
love with the lady Leonora.
Years ago, the previous
Count had a 'gypsy' woman
unjustly burnt at the stake
for allegedly bewitching di
Luna’s infant brother Garzia.
With her dying breath, the
gypsy woman commanded
her daughter – Azucena – to
avenge her by throwing the
infant Garzia into the flames.
In the heat of the moment,
however, Azucena mistakenly
casts her own child upon
the pyre and raises Garzia
as her surrogate son. Now
known as Manrico, he is a
knight outlawed for pledging
allegiance to a rival prince.
Bringing the story full circle,
Manrico and Leonora are
lovers; meanwhile, di Luna
searches for Azucena to
avenge his brother’s
death.
The opera
revolves around
these four
characters,
each with their
own intense
passions.
Inspired by
the boldness
of his charac-
ters, the parts
Verdi wrote for
them are difficult
and require great
technical skill. As
Enrico Caruso, the
great Italian operatic
tenor, famously said,
“All you need for Verdi’s Il
Trovatore are the four great-
est singers in the world.” I
would stop short of such high
praise of the Royal Opera
cast, although they make an
admirable attempt to rise to
the challenge. Maria Agresta
as Leonora faltered on the
high notes of her arias such
as Tacea la notte placida
(The peaceful night lay silent),
though she did improve as the
night went on. As Manrico,
Najmiddin Mavlyanov played
the chivalrous knight to per-
fection with his melodic voice
but did not quite bring out the
fervour needed in the scenes
of conflict. I enjoyed Quinn
Kelsey’s rich baritone; his solo
Il balen de suo sorriso (The
light of her smile), in which di
Luna expresses his undying
love for Leonora, was deeply
moving.
The indubitable star of the
show, however, was Anita
Rachvelishvili as Azucena.
Azucena is the character on
whom the tension of the plot
hinges; though she has the
power to reconcile the two di
Luna brothers at any point,

her desire for vengeance
hinders her from doing so,
and the story ends in tragedy.
Verdi saw her as the principal
character, going so far as
to claim, “If I were a prima
donna (a fine thing that would
be!), I would always rather
sing the part of the Gypsy in
Il trovatore.” With such big
shoes to fill, Rachvelishvili
embodies the part of Azucena
impressively. Her smouldering
voice made for a breathtak-
ingly intense Stride la vampa!
(The flames are rising!), while
her duet with Mavlyanov in
Non son tuo figlio (I am not
your son) was one of the best
pieces of the evening.
Director David Bösch’s
production premiered in July
earlier this year to largely
lukewarm reviews. Personally,
I found it quite aesthetically
pleasing; the bleak, snow-
filled landscape contrasts with
the flames of the pyre that
are an ever-present threat.
The anachronistic elements
– di Luna’s military tank, the
gypsy band transformed into
a travelling circus – detracted
from rather than improving
the production, but were easy
enough to ignore. Maybe I’ve
been desensitised after too
many avant-garde operatic
productions, but this really
wasn’t so bad.
Conductor Richard Farnes
led the ROH orchestra in
Verdi’s dramatic and
captivating score. This
is the first opera by
Verdi I’ve seen, and
the music made
it immediately
apparent why
he has such
a legacy as
an operatic
legend. A
classic opera,
with an excel-
lent cast and
ambitious direc-
tion – definitely
recommended.

The Little
Matchgirl and
Other Happier
Tales
E
mma Rice has
encapsulated
the spirit of the
season in the
Sam Wanamaker
Playhouse’s
Christmas production of The
Little Matchgirl and Other
Happier Tales, and it’s not as
jubilant as you might expect.
The artistic director has baked
together several of Hans
Christian Anderson’s tales
to create a composite piece,
which in her own words is a
"theatrical Christmas pudding
of many flavours". The
stories take us on a turbulent
emotional journey; the play
opens with Thumbelina, a
heart-warming tale of triumph
in the face of adversity. The
miniature heroine is delicately
puppeteered by Bettrys
Jones, and the adventure
is flecked with comedy by
the double act of Kyle Lima
and Jack Shalloo who we
encounter as garrulous
toads and later as pompous
beetles. There are moments
of genuine fright, none more
so than when Thumbelina is
taken hostage by a depraved
mole; the caprices of the plot
are unexpected and leave
you at the edge of your seat.
Next is The Emperor’s New
Clothes. This is a light hearted
take on the parable; keenly
aware of its audience in
cosmopolitan London and full
of references to Shoreditch
designers and EDM. We all
await the final twist, as the
mesmerised child in front of
me whispered, "he’s not going
to go out naked is he?!" but
it’s still magnificent when it
comes. Luckily for Paul Hunter
who plays the emperor (and
the rest of us no doubt) there
is no full frontal nudity here,
Ezra Kitson
instead, the Emperor wears
a luridly detailed onesie, it’s
a reveal so unexpected, so
filled with kitschy whimsy that
the room explodes into laugh-
ter and applause.
The third story is The
Princess and the Pea, and in
this interpretation, the plot
has been changed slightly.
Instead of the happy ending
that I was told as a child,
here the insecure prince loses
the princess due to his lack
of faith. This reworking of
the narrative, brought the
atmosphere to a sombre level

appropriate for the show’s
tragic end. Throughout the
performance, the overarching
tale of The Little Matchgirl
provides the crucial link in
the narrative as we pass from
story to story. She is always
with us on stage, alone and
shivering in the cold London
streets, dreaming up vibrant
tales to pass the night. There’s
a warmth in story telling that
she has shared with us, but it
will only help so much; as she
strikes her final match and
the flame begins to fade she
is discovered prostrate and
lifeless by a passing police-
man. The finale is deeply
moving, the shift from Victo-
rian to modern day London
conveyed through costuming
and in dialogue by the actors
remind us that poverty is not
just consigned to storybooks;
as Emma Rice concludes in
her introduction: "if only this
were just a story".
It’s a message of hope, not
despair that Rice wants to
send. At the performance's
end, the audience is reminded
of the ongoing work of organ-
isations such as Crisis and The
Salvation Army. We leave the
theatre with a festive appreci-
ation of the privileges that we
often take for granted, and
a powerful warning of the
dangers in being blind to the
indigence of those who aren’t
so lucky.
