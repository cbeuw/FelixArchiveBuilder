Zayd Alhaddad
performance to shutout
Swansea and end the game
with three easy outs, with
first-baseman Lucas convert-
ing the out at the last moment
to wrap it up as daylight was
fading.
With Imperial in the lead
heading into the new year
the morale is high in the
clubhouse and on the training
field. The team performance
is improving with every game
and much to Zayd’s delight,
the team is showing a lot of
hustle, a major element in the
sport of baseball. 2016 may
have had its struggles for
Imperial baseball but at the
rate things are going 2017
will be our year.
A
fter two
rounds of
university
baseball in
the inaugural
National
League, the Imperial
Immigrants are top of the
South with three wins and
one loss. Splitting the double-
header against Essex in the
first round, the Immigrants
wanted to establish control
of the league against
newcomers Swansea.
However, technical difficulties
involving Harlington meant
that the games had to be
played elsewhere. Croydon.
Nine Imperial players
managed to show up to
south London compared to
Swansea who brought more
than double that number.
The first game of the double
header had some fearful
moments, with Swansea
getting a base-clearing triple
in the top of the first; three
on the scoreboard. But in the
bottom of the first, the Immi-
grants would not be outdone,
scoring six to put them ahead.
The second inning showed
the true spirit of IC. After
letting two players on base
from an error and a walk,
third baseman Zayd caught
two out to take the pressure
off and let IC get the easy out
to end the inning. Stepping
up to the plate was Swansea’s
star player who hit a ball
hard into center field and with
the base runners going hard,
rookie centre-fielder Joe
turned on the hustle to make
an incredible inning-ending
catch, saving two runs in the
process and giving pitcher
Justin a no-hitter inning. The
Immigrants picked it back up
in the third to score another
five runs, assisted by rookie
Stevie’s impressive RBI hits
and solid base-running by
newcomer Abdul and veteran
Matt. The game ended 8-11
to Imperial.
The follow-up showed
the improvements the team
has gone through since the
start of the year. In the first
inning, the Immigrants got
five runs on the board, a lead
cut down by the end of the
inning. Not to be left in the
dust, the Immigrants turned
on the jets to score another
four to take a 9-5 lead. Team
captain Eduardo came on
with a Zach Britton-esque

n a recent fixture, the 5s
netball team smashed
the Roehampton 6th
team
beating them 50-7. It
was an interesting away
game as the umpires
seemed particularly clueless
and uninterested in the game.
Unfortunately, the captain
Sheethal Jethwa couldn’t
play in the match but made
a great cheerleader by
the side, keeping the team
vocal and motivated. The
highlight of the match was
watching Puja Dodhia pick
up the ball (which everyone
knew had gone out but the
umpires seemed blissfully
unaware), as it slowly rolled
across the court, to shoot
and score while everyone
else stood around not really
understanding what was
going on. The game ended
with the highest score and
biggest goal difference of
the season for the team, a
notable achievement. The
player of the match was
awarded to Shen Yin Ga. The
decisive victory for the team
is an indication of how strong
this year’s group of freshers
are, with the support of
returning players, as well as
the progress being made in
training. The netball 5s have
racked up another impressive
win against the LSE and
Roehampton’s 5s as well.
The Imperial netball 1s also
triumphed with an impressive
performance against the
Imperial Medic 2s at a
packed match in Ethos. Used
as a varsity showcase match,
both teams came determined
to win in front of a loud
crowd. The match was intense
from the offset with both
sets of shooters ensuring the
match stayed close. Despite
the Medics initially taking the
lead, the first quarter ended
with the Imperial 1s leading
by seven goals, but with it all
still to play for. The Medics
showed a lot of fight in their
play, contesting every ball in
the second and third quarters.
However, Imperial 1s stayed
calm and, using mid-court
and defensive players Fi
and Beth, as second options,
allowed the team to convert
the vast majority of turnovers
and centres into goals. Feed-
ing into the shooting circle
also improved, with Emily and
Amelia’s passing into Char-
lotte being fast and accurate.
Some very much needed fresh
legs in both the defensive and
centre court enabled Imperial
to keep the pressure on and
widen the goal difference
further. Special mention has
to go to both Jasmine, the
coach, and the Haribo Filippa
brought for keeping the team
motivated and focused into
the last quarter. The end of
the match saw impressive
play, especially from the GD
and GK who kept up the pres-
sure despite tiredness. The
final score was 59-31 to the
Imperial 1s, with player of the
match going to Emily Calam-
ita. The netball club would
like to thank everyone who
turned up to support them.
Imperial College has six
netball teams who play on
Mondays and Wednesday
day at Heston and Ethos.
Needless to say, recent form
makes a compelling case
for a varsity headlined by
Netball. People are welcome
to come and support our
players at any match. Voting
for netball to headline Varsity
closes this Friday.
