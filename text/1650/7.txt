The people who
travel on long-
distance buses are
all freaks
Tessa Davey explores what it is about
coach travel that makes people so
inconsiderate.
T
here are three types
of people who take
overnight coaches:
the stupid, those
trying to fulfil a
stereotype, and the
desperate.
This seems like a bold
statement, I know, but let
me explain. You see, I fall
into one of these categories
(stupid, certainly), lured in
by Megabus’ £11 ticket to
Amsterdam, and I always
observe the same things.
It seems like a great deal.
You’ll get on a coach in the
evening, read a book, fall
asleep, and wake up the next
day in a European city of your
dreams, having spent less
than the price of two drinks in
a central London bar. You’ll
arrive rested, rejuvenated,
and ready to explore. What
will actually happen is that
you’ll arrive (inevitably, at
around 6am) at a foreign bus
station which will invariably
be miles from the centre of the
city, in the roughest possible
area imaginable. You’ll be
freezing (no matter what
time of the year it is), and will
almost certainly be stiff and
grumpy from the journey, and
exhausted from having spent
the night awake, enraged at
your fellow passengers. Plus
you’ll probably really need
to pee, the toilet having been
out of action for the second
half of the journey, causing
distress both to everyone’s
bladders and nasal passages.
I’ve never had a successful
first day after this, and I’ve
never failed to swear never
do it again – a promise that
lasts until I get excited about
the next European destination.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is
why I am one of the stupid.
Maybe the bus journey in
itself would be bearable were
it not of the people on the bus.
And yes, if you’re travelling
on a long-distance coach, you
are one of these awful people.
There’s something about
bus stations that removes all
sense of normal decency.
Nowhere else would the level
of aggression and selfishness
be acceptable, and each
person’s sense of boundaries
changes so dramatically in
response to this. In Victoria
Coach Station two weeks
ago, a man spat at me and
another deliberately hit my
shins with his umbrella while
I was waiting patiently to get
on a bus. Even I’ve been know
to take off most of my clothes,
have a wash with baby wipes,
and put on new clothes, all
while viciously defending my
place in a queue to get on a
Flixbus in a Paris bus station (I
may have snarled at someone
– I take my right to first dibs on
a window seat seriously).
This isn’t something that I
do in Sainsbury’s while I’m
waiting to pay for my weekly
shop, but it feels perfectly
normal and acceptable in a
bus station in the middle of
the night. Yes I know, I am
contributing to the horrible
experience of bus travel.
But yet I am somewhat
considerate: I have the
decency to make sure that I
am fresh and clean (at least
as much as possible) before
embarking on twelve hours
packed like sardines with
fifty other people, one whose
personal space you will violate
just by existing in the space
next to them. But not everyone
does this, be it because they
don’t care to, or they can’t.
And these are the desperate.
The ones who need to make
this journey and can only
afford to do it by bus. They’re
travelling to see loved ones, or
to achieve their dreams. I can’t
really blame the desperate
for their unpreventable
contribution to the hell that is
international coach travel, but
I can place some sort of blame
on anyone who demonstrates
an avoidable lack of personal
hygiene and respect for their
fellow passengers.
What about the poor
students, I hear you cry?
Where do they come in? Well,
if they really can’t afford an
extra couple of tenners for a
much more pleasant budget
flight, then by all means, stick
them on a coach, and maybe
send them a link to a money
management guide. Usually
though, they’re taking the
coach out of some desire to be
the image of what they think
a student should be: creatives
travelling on a shoestring,
wearing thrift store bargains
they picked up in Budapest,
sporting silly haircuts, reading
Kafka and listening to Kate
Bush. They have a romantic
idea that they are building
character; their pretentious
sullen faces as they sulkily
wait at passport control
at Calais tell you that they
think they’re better than you.
Their misguided arrogance
is amusing for about five
minutes, but no one wants to
be stuck in a confined space
with them for 24 hours.
In other countries and
continents, bus travel seems
to be more tolerable and
less dominated by this kind
of degenerates, but as soon
as there’s an long-distance
coach passing through
London Victoria, the quality
of the clientele plummets. So
why bother? It’s literally not
worth it when you could pay
an extra £30 to be there in
a tenth of the time. Do me a
favour and fly, so that when
I’m stupid enough to take the
bus, I at least have a bit more
space.
