Turner Prize
2016 winner
Helen Marten’s
work? "Baffling"
claim some
critics, "Poetic", others –
Michael Gove, former
Education Secretary
went so far as to tweet
"#Turnerprize2016 -
congratulations to Helen
Martin but #honestly is this
= to Turner, Ruskin, even
Holman Hunt – of course not
#modishcrap". Never mind
the misspelling of Marten's
name from the self appointed
spelling and grammar
'saviour' – Marten's work
is far from 'modish crap'
(whatever that means) and in
fact, her work may be closer
to J.M.W. Turner's than it first
appears.
Turner's brushwork was
loose, evocative rather than
representative, similarly,
Marten’s sculptures are free-
form – transforming everyday
objects into object salads that
look like daydreams forced
into three dimensions. Speak-
ing to Charlotte Higgins of the
Guardian, Marten has said
she reads and researches
without “any specific end
goal in mind”, her reading
matter is diverse, from philos-
ophy to poetry by way of the
news. It’s stream-of-conscious-
ness poetry that most comes
to mind when encountering
Marten’s work; steel is tacked
onto timber, cloth is draped
like discarded clothing,
spoons are bent out of shape
and hammered onto a corner,
elsewhere matchsticks are
threaded through the work.
It’s as if Marten has emptied
out her half-formed thoughts
into the physical world. We
are left to follow the trail of
associations, the flights of
fancy, the abrupt changes of
mood – sometimes they lead
nowhere, sometimes they
strike a chord with our own
thoughts.
The Turner Prize judges
nominees not for the work
they create for the Prize exhi-
bition, but work displayed the
preceding year. For Marten,
one of these was her show at
Greene Naftali: Eucalyptus,
Let Us In. The mediums list
for one piece in the show,
Brood and Bitter Pass, should
give some indication of the
breadth of materials Marten
draws inspiration from: steel,
aluminium, model board, ash,
cherry, chipboard, sprayed
MDF, blown glass, glazed
ceramic, screen printed
Latex, bucket, cast resin,
cast jesmonite, stones; so
the list continues, including
everything from magnets,
concrete, cotton, and lace, to
2016 has been a year of
unmitigated success – last
month she won the Hepworth
Prize for Sculpture, another
hugely prestigious award.
and now it is the Turner, she
is also holding a solo show at
the Serpentine Gallery. The
artists nominated alongside
her were Anthea Hamilton,
Josephine Pryce, and Michael
Dean. For some, Michael
Dean was the dark horse
in the race, who could’ve
bagged the top prize. Dean’s
exhibition was an installation
representing the poverty
line – a pile of over 2 million
pennies, just one penny less
than the £20,436 that the
government believes is the
minimum two adults and two
children could survive on in a
year.
Last year, the Turner Prize,
which celebrates the best
artists under 50 of that year,
went to the architectural
group, Assemble, who won
for their transformation of the
housing estate Granby Four
Streets. It was a departure
from the norm to award
the prize to a project that
was ostensibly not 'art'. No

The list of materials alone
could be a sort of free-form
minimalist poetry.
What is perhaps the most
noteworthy of Marten’s
work is that despite her use
of everyday objects, almost
nothing is a ready-made –
this is not simply hordes of
found things tacked together.
Instead, objects appear as
if from a half-remembered
dream – that there could
almost be fire hydrant, almost
but not quite, in another
sculpture, the end could be
scraps from a rocket, or a
giant bullet blown apart
and stuck back together. In
another work, Packed for
Perdition, in the right corner,
a curve hangs like a sickle
moon against a night sky.
Underneath, a tiny keyboard
is drawn on a grid, and
beside it it’s raining on a
cardboard cut-out of a house,
only the rain seems to be
acid rain, and falls like the
patterns of Braille. Despite
the seemingly absurd nature
of her work, Marten carefully
considers the placement of
each detail, finding acute
clarity in her work. Certainly,
the shapes she creates look
considered, they flow – one
object melting seamlessly into
another, look closer and there
are eye-catching details – a
sudden drop of rope, a spike
jutting out at precisely the
right angle. These are works
that, once seen, are not easily
forgotten.
For 31-year-old Marten,
stranger to controversy, the
Prize will no doubt raise eye-
brows, (at least the eyebrows
of the public – the critics by
and large were fans) again
this year for their celebration
of Marten.
That Marten’s work defies
explanation was a strength
for this year’s judges. The
chair of judges, Tate Britain
director Alex Farquharson,
praised Marten for her poetic
sculpting technique, saying:
“The judges were impressed
by the complexity of the
work...how it often suggests
meaning, but those meanings
are all in flux somehow. One
image, one form becomes
another.” Marten’s work
is unlike that of any of her
contemporaries, that it sparks
conversation about art, and
the forms it can take can only
be a good thing.
Marten has said she finds
the whole idea of winning
prizes “embarrassing”, she
has gone so far as to say that
she will share her winnings of
£25,000 amongst her fellow
nominees. There is a true
spirit of originality in Marten
work, the Turner has elevated
many of its winners, Chris
Ofili, Tracey Emin, Damien
Hirst to name a few to lasting
influence in the modern art
world – Marten will hope that
this new accolade will encour-
age more people to engage
and attempt to understand
her vision.

T
he story of Peter
Pan, popularised
by Disney in 1953,
hardly needs
any introduction.
However, not
everyone knows of its
darker history. J.M. Barrie
first invented the character
in 1902 in The Little White
Bird, a semi-autobiographical
story about a small boy who
is befriended by a lonely
London bachelor. In actual
fact, Peter Pan was based on
the five boys of the Llewelyn
Davies family who Barrie
came to know. There have
been some questions raised
about the exact nature of
Barrie’s interest in these boys;
at any rate, he went on to
become their guardian after
the successive deaths of
their parents. The final Peter
Pan was a “demon boy”, a
devilish character who Barrie
originally specified as the
villain of the story.
Like the boy himself, Peter
Pan has been adapted into
a multitude of shapes and
forms. But from the moment
Nana steps onto stage – a
burly man dressed in a frilly
nursemaid’s outfit – one gets
the idea that Sally Cookson’s
production will be a touch
unconventional. Casting the
middle-aged Paul Hilton as
Peter is a masterful stroke
that brings out the paradox
of Peter’s stubborn refusal to
grow up. The discon-
nect between Peter’s
physical and mental
maturity is jarring;
despite his reced-
ing hairline, he
has no idea
what a kiss is,
and curls up in
his old peram-
bulator with a
teddy bear.
There is an
underlying
theme of mater-
nal affection
that few produc-
tions of Peter Pan
manage to pick up.
Barrie’s troubled child-
hood was overshadowed
by his mother’s love for his
elder brother David. When
David died at a tragically
young age in a skating
accident, Barrie strived to
replace him, dressing up in his
dead brother’s clothes so that
“even [his] mother should not
know the difference”. Perhaps
it is not such a surprise that
Barrie’s Peter Pan returned
home only to find the window
barred and another little boy
sleeping in his bed. The first
title for Peter Pan was Peter
Pan, or The Boy Who Hated
Mothers. Startlingly, Captain
Hook and Mrs. Darling were
originally meant to be played
by the same actress, throwing
Peter and the mother figure
into direct conflict.
Sally Cookson, the director,
returns to this original casting:
Anna Francolini tucks her
children lovingly into bed as
Mrs. Darling, but makes a
frightful Captain Hook who

unhesitatingly disembowels a

As with the other characters
in the play, Captain Hook
is more than just a one-di-
mensional bad guy. For all
her piratical swagger and
bluster, she is really a balding,
desolate woman pursued
by Tick Tock the crocodile,
a thinly veiled metaphor for
the closing jaws of Time. Her
obsession with Peter Pan is a
twisted version of maternal
love. And while Peter triumphs
over Captain Hook, he ulti-
mately fails to take Wendy
from Mrs. Darling at the end
of the play.
For the many children in
the audience, such ideas of
growing up and abandon-
ment probably went right
over their heads. But there
was no shortage of things
to keep them entertained.
Flashing lights, floating
planets, thrilling fight scenes
and the suitably buccaneering
Captain Hook made for a
riveting two hours that lived
up to the wild imagination of
its author. Best of all, if you’re
going to have characters that
can fly, you might as well
make good use of them. As
Peter and Wendy soared out
across the audience on their
“fairy strings”, the cheering
audience certainly agreed.
Sally Cookson’s take on
Peter Pan is refreshing, if only
because bowdlerised ver-
sions so rarely attempt to
capture the essence of
J.M. Barrie’s “terrible
masterpiece”. As
with the original
incarnation,
Cookson’s
production
retains a frolic-
some energy
despite the
melancholy
at its heart.
This bittersweet
production is
definitely for
grown-ups too –
even if, like Wendy
at the end of the
play, we have already
“forgotten how to fly”.
