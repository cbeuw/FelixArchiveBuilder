Qasim Mahmood gives the dirt on the development of two widely anticipated games and why
they’re only being released now
\\ Disaster struck
as the game
unexpectantly met
with severe delays
during development

franchise. The develop-
ment team was changed
and reshuffled, with
Hajime Tabata taking
over as director, and
development started from
scratch. Amazingly, after
multiple delays, the game
was finally released last
Monday and from reviews
and my own impressions,
it is fantastic!
The Last Guardian is
T
en years is a very
long time. Ten years
ago in 2006, the
Xbox 360 had been
out for a year and
both the Wii and
PS3 were released. Call of
Duty 4: Modern Warfare
released the following year,
thus starting the boom of first
person shooters. The original
iPhone didn’t even release
until 2007; instead, the
newest portable Apple device
was the iPod 5G. NASA also
launched their New Horizons
space probe to perform a
flyby of Pluto, which it just
completed in October 2016.
Ten years is not only
enough time for the
gaming landscape and
very special games: Final
Fantasy XV and The Last
Guardian.
Final Fantasy 15 began
development back in
2006 as part of the
Fabula Nova Crystallis
Final Fantasy – a trilogy
of games based upon the
mythos of crystals being
linked to deities. The three
games were Final Fantasy
XIII, Final Fantasy Versus
XIII and Final Fantasy
Agito XIII, though over
the next few years this
changed significantly. Of
the three games, the one
most important to this
discussion is Final Fantasy
Versus XIII, as it was ini-
tially named.
As Final Fantasy Versus
XIII, it began as a spin-
off title that was darker
in tone and allowed the
development team to take
a different approach. The
development was led by
Tetsuya Nomura, famous
as lead director for the
much-lauded Kingdom
Hearts series. Then dis-
aster struck as the game
unexpectedly met with
severe difficulties during
development, and over the
following six years it sadly
only appeared in small
fragments. The decision
was then made to shift the
game from the PS3 to the
PS4 and Xbox One, so
they switched from their
original game engine
to their newly-designed
engine, Luminous Studio.
Then, at E3 2013, came
the monumental moment
where the game was pub-
licly announced as Final
Fantasy 15, rebranded
as a mainline entry in the
another extremely interesting
game. It started development
in 2007, just after the release
of the PS3, by Team Ico, the
minds behind Ico and the
critically-acclaimed Shadow
of the Colossus, considered
to be one of the best games
released on the PS2. The
Last Guardian was planned
to release early in the PS3’s
life and was shown off in
both 2009 and 2011, though
after this, word on the game
ceased completely.
Over the next few years,
many assumed the game to
be dead, buried because
of its incredibly troubled
development. The game was
considered to be progressing
extremely slowly by Shuhei
Yoshida, president of Sony,
and other studios were
brought in to improve the
code and game performance.
The decision was then made
to switch to the PS4 and even
more teams were called to
help adapt the code to suit
the PS4.
Another major factor was
the decision of Team Ico, spe-
cifically the director Famitsu
Ueda, to leave Sony in 2011,
due to “a sense of crisis” on
hearing about the game’s
delay. Many left to join other
companies and work on other
games. Despite leaving and
forming a new studio, gen-
DESIGN, Ueda still remained
as the main developer of the
game and worked alongside
The release of two giants
Sony to finish development.
Four years later at E3 2015,
the gaming landscape was
shaken when the game was
officially announced to be
coming to the PS4 in 2016.
The rumours that it was dead
were silenced and after the
announcement the excitement
was palpable. The game will
release this Friday and much
like Final Fantasy 15, early
reviews are very positive.
E3 2015 was dubbed “The
E3 of Dreams” by the former
team of GameTrailers, cur-
rently Easy Allies, and I must
say I agree. Final Fantasy 15
and The Last Guardian were
both stuck in development
hell for almost 10 years, and
looking back it is a miracle
they are being released at all,
proving that dreams really
can come true.
