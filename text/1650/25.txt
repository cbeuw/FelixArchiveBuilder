CANCER
VIRGO
This week you buy a
bomb vest and plan to
detonate it at the crying
at the queens lawn
event. It’s a jagerbomb
vest because it’s almost
Christmas and you just
don’t care anymore.

ARIES
This week you get
seriously smushed
while playing rugby.
You’re temporarily
paralysed, but you’re
most upset about your
broken finger. It’s your
favourite finger. It’s
your fingering finger.
This week you’re the
editors questionably
minor concussion and
you want to make it
clear that this shit ain’t
your doing. The paper
has always been a
clusterfuck, with brain
damage or without.
This week you finally
discover that Queen’s
Tower is in fact a giant
mood ring. Turns out
the blue lights at night
means its students are
tired and stressed.
No wonder it’s not
changed all year.
This week you decide to
stage a protest because
the library cafe keeps
running out of your fave
energy drink and I mean
it’s almost exam season
and you’re you need
your source of sugar
or you’ll have a mental
breakdown.
This week you become
highly politicized and
encourage your fellow
students to join in with
union council. 2hrs of
union council later you
are returned to your
nonpolitical equilibrium.
This week you tried to
look cool while cycling.
You will never look as
cool as you did right
before you smacked
your head on the cold
wet asphalt.
This week you finally
make sense of all this
university crap. It’s not
about this sort of degree
or that sort of degree,
It’s about a red white
and blue degree. Duh.
This week you’re flying
home for Xmas only you
realise you’re going to
miss some important
lectures and tutorials and
a secret Santa you signed
up to. Who needs marks
and a social life anyway?
This week you’re still
trying to look cool while
cycling. Your stupidly
long scarf gets caught
in the back wheel and
almost strangles you.
Beauty is pain.
This week you ignore
the advice of medical
professionals and continue
in your editorial position
despite severe head
trauma. You slander
yourself, sue the paper and
win! At least now you can
pay for the lasting brain
damage
This week you’re
stressing over all the
deadlines that are
coming up and all the
work you haven’t done.
T. Oh well, maybe UCL
will take you with open
arms when you fail.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m writing to you as a last resort. I know you’re not
particularly helpful. I know you find it hard to focus
sometimes, but I’m really angry and no one is taking me
seriously, so I hope at least you can find it in you heart
to lend this stranger a helping hand. Long story short,
Someone keeps steeling my bike accessories. It’s nothing
major. It all started with my bell. Such an inexpensive thing
to steal, I thought maybe it just fell off. But then my mud-
guard went missing, then my front light followed suit and
yesterday they took my fucking bike seat! I mean come on!
They even peeled a sticker off the frame! Pls advise.
Best,
Psych Lis T.
HOROSCOPES
Dear Psych,
Firstly, wow. Just wow. The nerve of some
people. Reaching out to you to ask for help
ONLY to put you down and criticise your work
in a very, VERY non-constructive way. I mean
do you see me coming into your (I’m going to
take a wild guess and assume you’re a com-
puter scientist) computer lab and talk shit about
your... your... GIFS or floppy discs or whatever
it is you computer nerds do?
I mean you don’t even know me! Of course I
find it hard to focus! I have multiple snacking
disorder. I literally need to get up every twenty
minutes to procure a snack or I die (inside).
Thankfully you’re wrong and I’m a Professional
so I’ll proceed by leaving your attitude behind
me and answering your question.
Now I’m not a bike specialist but it sounds to
me like you probably have a really shit bike
with really expensive non-essential parts. I
mean if I was a bike thief I’d just take your
whole bike. Unless it’s obviously worthless. Is
you bike obviously worthless? If yes, then just
invest in a better bike you pleb.
If not then clearly someone doesn’t like you. I
can’t blame them. If the first thing you do when
you introduce yourself to a stranger is shit all
over their work, then you’re really just asking
for your bike seat to be stolen. So maybe you
just need to look within. Ask yourself “Who
hurt me?” and as soon as you have your
answer, track them down and hurt them back
because I don’t want to be the receiver of all
these bad vibe. Nope. Deal with your shit.
Stop being so angry.
Big luv,
Chris xxxxx
O
bviously I’m not
well versed in
queer-speak, so
I had to send
a telegram to
the nearest
trading post in order to get one
of those Indians to research on a
computer for me. It seems that,
sadly, many of today’s children
are deluded and are making
up words like ‘intersectionality’,
‘tweet’, or ‘transsexual’, and it
is just sad to see their grip upon
reality slowly disappear. Frankly,
if the word isn’t in the Bible then it
isn’t actually a word and shouldn’t
be featured in a newspaper, but
since this newspaper is edited by a
known homosexual, I believe that
all traces of credibility have truly
been lost.
Let’s face it people, multicultural-
ism just doesn’t work. I will dumb
this idea down into an idea that
you stupid millennials will under-
stand: If I have a WKD and I piss in
it, you can still taste the WKD, and
in fact it may initially taste better,
but after a while you will realise
that the original WKD you had
is now just a warm bottle of piss
and unless you are stranded in the
jungle liked I was in Vietnam, you
will not want to drink it. Still can’t
believe it was over 50 years ago. I
can still remember looking for the
Viet Cong. Darkness. The smell of
blood. FLASHING. PAIN. KILL ALL
VIETNAMESE. GLOBAL WARM-
ING IS A CHINESE CONSPIRACY.
Sorry. Furthermore, intersection-
ality can’t work mostly for the fact
that all of the browns seem to eat
strange food. How can we decide
where to invade if their food
is completely unpalatable to a
normal palate. Also what is it with
their lot and covering their women?
I mean, don’t get me wrong, I
haven’t suffered a brain injury and
awoken a feminist. I only wonder
as to why they want to cover
women when what they want is
to be looked at by men. You see,
women thrive on attention and
when you deprive them of it they
become inconsolable and start to
cry. Why can’t these Islamists dress
normally like Christians? I mean
apart from nuns, we don’t force
women to cover up at any point.
If you speak another language,
please keep it private. I can’t
bear the thought of our children
being exposed to other cultures
and languages, slowly becoming
indoctrinated into the fundamental-
ist culture of the Islamic Caliphate
of Birmingham. In fact the other
day I heard a white child say the
phrase “salaam alaikum”, and I
was seconds away from shooting
it in the face before someone told
me it was sand-speak for hello. If
we are to have a culture where
we can trust everyone, then all
the non-white people need to
start speaking in English so I can
understand what they’re saying.
Otherwise you can’t get annoyed
at us for stopping you at customs.
I
ntersectionality. Sundry.
Cajole. All three of these
words are ones that I did
not know until I quickly
googled them, and despite
only skim reading the
definition on dictionary.com, I now
believe I have a sound enough
understanding of them in order
to write a portentous think piece.
Intersectionality comes from the
roots ‘Inter-’ and ‘-sectionality’
and means if you put two things
together they should fit together,
even if you need to force one of
the tabs into the other slots to get
them to coexist. I hear from my less
eco-aware friends that this is how
Ikea furniture works; however, I
refuse to have any furniture in my
flat that isn’t made completely out
of reconstituted Brazilian elephant
faeces. I just feel closer to the
animals that way.
In times of struggle I often look to
our Lord and saviour Owen Jones,
and indeed dear readers, as I was
standing in the hummus section
of Whole Foods, did I need to
look upon his boyish face which I
keep in my wallet. It was at Whole
Foods that I came across a travesty
upon our society. It turns out that
rich people are actually allowed
in Whole Foods now and I can’t
believe that we would allow this
mix of diversity. This is the wrong
type of diversity. The diversity we
should have should be of all the
nationalities of the world, as long
as they speak English of course,
as I simply don’t have the time to
interact with another culture on
their own terms.
I was on High Street Kensington,
and for some reason a woman
wearing a large fur coat thought
that she could mix with me, a
person who has rejected the
consumerism of the modern world
(apart from smoothies because I
fucking love them) as it didn’t suit
my artisanal vegan cheese and
poetry lifestyle. You see I can’t
tolerate rich people because, well,
they’re just not like me. They have
often grown up in an environment
and a culture that they had no
part in choosing; however, this is
different as to what I grew up with
and so naturally I must resent them
for this.
If anything, the one branch of
intersectionality that I think we
are not exploring deep enough is
that of the relationship between
man and sheep. Why is this a joke
to people? Historically the Welsh
have always had this sort of inter-
sectionality that I wish was deemed
acceptable within English society.
Only can we be truly free and
accepting as a society when we
accept that a relationship between
a man and a sheep, maybe even a
lamb, is as natural as freshly made
baba ganoush. Wait a second.
Apparently intersectionality isn’t
spelt inter-sex-tionality? I hope the
copy-editors pick up on that.
We need diversity,
but I shouldn’t have
to change

acceptance of those he deems
acceptable

doesn’t work, they
