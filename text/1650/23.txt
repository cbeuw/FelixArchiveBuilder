DRUGS
DRUGS
What makes you more likely to take drugs?
A
ll people are
the same.
Or are they?
When it comes
to drug use it
appears they
are not, especially according
to the catchily-named Home
Office document Drug
Misuse: Findings from the
2014/15 Crime Survey for
England and Wales. Second
edition.
Some of the key findings of
the report are particularly
surprising. Surprising, that is,
if you’ve lived in the Siberian
wilderness your whole life.
The report proudly claims
to have uncovered that
“Younger people are more
likely to take drugs than older
people”. Yes, this is an actual
finding. It makes you wonder
how much taxpayers’ money
was spent on this valuable
piece of information. Fifty
grand? One hundred grand?
I’m sure I’d have been able to
churn out the same informa-
tion for a fiver.
Further exciting discover-
ies include that “Men are

more likely to take drugs
than women”. Apparently
around one in eight (11.9%)
men aged between 16 and
59 had taken an illegal drug
in the past year, compared
to around one in eighteen
women (5.4%). Furthermore,
there have been no notable
changes regarding gender
between the 2014/15 (this
document is produced every
year?!) and the 2015/16
surveys. With the discrepan-
cies between sexes you would
think the infamous male-fe-
male Imperial ratio would
ensure we’d all be awash with
illegal substances.
Another of the findings is
dependent on lifestyle factor.
This fascinating document
proclaims that “illicit drug use
varies by lifestyle factors such
as frequency of nightclub
visits and alcohol consump-
tion”. Seemingly, the use of
Class A drugs by persons in
the twelve months prior to
the research was around ten
times higher in those who had
visited a nightclub more than
three times in the past month.
The drug of choice for these
individuals is mainly cocaine
and ecstasy, which makes
perfect sense to me. I mean,
who wants to take ketamine
in a club? Similarly, if you
visit a pub or bar more than
eight times, statistically you
are 26 times more likely to
use cocaine than those who
had not visited a bar or pub
at all in the last month. To
me these findings appear to
make sense. Basically, this
means that if you’re one of
those stereotypical Imperial
students who’s allergic to
Ministry of Sound then you’re
less likely to enjoy some good
coke on a Tuesday evening.
Seems legit.
The area in which you live
also has an effect. The “use of
any drug was higher among
those living in urban areas
compared with those living
in rural areas”, with 9.1%
of people in urban areas
having used a drug in the
past year, compared to 6.5%
of those in rural areas. So
we London-living students
should have no problem
finding someone to supply
those illegal study drugs. In
conjunction, information is
also provided on those living
in “deprived areas”. The use
of any drug is more wide-
spread in areas considered
to be the most deprived by
the government. With 10.2%
of these people experienc-
ing drug use, as opposed
to 6.9% in “non-deprived”
areas. It should seem simple
then for the powers-that-be to
implement drug rehabilitation
centres effectively (if they
were competent). But judging
by the current stance of polit-
ical elites worldwide, drug
addicts are unlikely to get
little more than a polite wave
and maybe a jail cell from
their friendly neighbourhood
politician.
It seems that people of
differing gender, age and
geographical location have
varied habits when it comes
to drug use. Basically, if
you’re a young male living in
London who visits a pub nine
times a month then you’re
more or less guaranteed to
be a crack addict.
