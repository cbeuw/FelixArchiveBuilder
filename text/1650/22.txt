unch at somewhere
outside of university is
‘the thing’ nowadays,
but who has time
for that with all the
lab reports and
homework and tutorial sheets
and so on? Besides the money
it saves, eating in school
seems to be a pretty good
idea, especially if you have to
stay in pretty late: socialising
(some) and working (less) at
the same time as you eat. Win
on both (actually three) sides,
right?
And with the choice to lunch
in at university, you probably
have two options: one of
the college’s restaurants/
cafeterias (you actually can
go around the world’s cuisine
in just one or so week, with
no stress and on a moderate
budget) or the never expiring
sandwich (which can also
come in a lot of varieties).
But have you thought of
being ‘the difference’ and
bring lunch that is not a sand-
wich? The ‘be the difference
you want to see in the world’
and eat healthier and better?
Changing people’s eating
habits? Kind of the same thing
I try to do here, but in your
friendship group.
So, yes, you’ve probably
guessed right when you
assumed that I am going to
guide you step by step (hold
your hand, if necessary, or
wipe out your tears when
your Asian friends tell you
that the rice is not cooked
properly) through lunch box
making – the best edition
you can have without waking
up hours earlier. It takes me
30 minutes, but I can easily
prepare some bits the evening
before so I can sleep in ten
extra minutes.
requires extra time you don’t
actually have).
In the morning
Preheat a pan with a knob
of butter.
Preheat the oven to 230C
Take the chicken breast and
cut it into strips (or really, any
other form you want; if you
want it heart-shaped, go on
– have some fun!). Salt and
pepper it. Maybe you want
to add some extra chilli or
anther spices that you fancy.
Fry the onion with the
carrots in the butter until
they become soft. Be careful
not to overcook the onion.
Remove the inside of the
mushroom(the gills and stem
- for all the biologists out
there), chop them and add
to the pan along with the
onions and carrots.. Mix all
of the veggies and the diced
plum with the rice and fill the
mushroom cap. Try to make a
small well in the middle of the
rice, to hold your egg.
Put the mushroom in the
oven and cook it for five
minutes. Give the pan a quick
wipe and return to the hob,
with some more oil. When
hot, add the chicken and fry
on a high heat.
Take out the mushroom and
put the egg in the well that
you left in the centre. Be care-
ful not to spill it (too much).
Add some grated cheese on
top of it (the more the better)
The night before (just if you
are as lazy as I am and you
prefer to sleep in)
Cut the carrot and the plum
into small cubes and slice the
onion and put in the fridge
in separate containers. Cook
some rice (½ of a cup is
more than enough, but you
can cook more for multiple
and cook it in the oven for six
more minutes. By now, your
chicken should definitely be
done, so don’t forget to check
it. Remove it from the pan,
and reserve,
Meanwhile, you should
prepare the healthy part of
the meal: the salad. Chop the
tomato and slice the cucum-
ber. Mix them with the salad
leaves and the peas. Dress
it with olive oil, vinegar and
lemon juice.
Put everything in a pretty
lunchbox: the stuffed mush-
room, chicken strips and
salad. I prefer putting the
corn in a corner, not mixing
in with the salad, but you can
do if you prefer. Add the
yoghurt in a small container
and try not to forget it.
Now, you are all set up for
lunch – and what a better
way to impress that girl/boy
than by showing them that
you can actually cook? Basic
needs, people!
P.S. Don’t forget to brag
about it. It’s essential.

meals). This is the step where
you can just cheat a bit and
buy some instant rice (I defi-
nitely do that, but according
to the experts, it is not prop-
erly cooked).
Don’t forget to take the
chicken breast out of the
freezer and put it in the
fridge (so you won’t have to
defrost it in the morning - that
