Problematic faves | Nico
Sometimes artists we love have
characters that we don’t. In our new
weekly feature, we examine some of the
artists whose antics regularly embarrass
their fans. Can we separate the music
from the artist? First up is German singer,
Nico.
Fred Fyles
M
y
problematic
fave is the
German-
born singer
Nico, who
found fame as a Warhol
Superstar, working with
The Velvet Underground
on their debut album. She
then went on to discover
the harmonium and make a
series of experimental albums
that have only recently
begun to be recognised for
the masterpieces they are.
Nico’s work is Gothic in the
true sense of the word: her
icy, deep vocals, chillingly
accented by the sound of
slow progressions on the
harmonium, feel like a cold
wind blowing through the
crypt of a cathedral, all dust
and rust and power.
Nico was also, unfor-
tunately, deeply racist.
Journalist Danny Fields, who
helped Nico sign to Elektra
Records – with whom she
would make the 1968 LP The
Marble Index – described her
as ‘Nazi-esque’, saying that
‘She had a definite Nordic
Aryan streak, [the belief] that
she was physically, spiritually
and creatively superior.’ Her
behaviour supports this opin-
ion: at a Berlin concert she
angered the crowd by singing
the German national anthem
‘Das Leid der Deutschen’,
including the verses usually
omitted for its nationalist
connotations; and – accord-
ing again to Fields – there
was an incident in the early
1970s when Nico smashed
a glass in a mixed-race
woman’s eye, whilst saying ‘I
hate black people’. Nico died
in 1988, at the young age of
49, missing the internet age
of ‘problematic faves’, but
any admirer of her music must
confront her racist worldview.
However, I think it is remiss
not to look at how Nico’s
racism developed. She was
born Christa Päffgen in
Cologne in 1938, a mere
five months after Austria
was annexed. Her father
sustained head injuries after
being enlisted in the army,
and ended his life in a psy-
chiatric hospital. Christa and
her mother fled to the suburbs
of Berlin while Cologne
was hit with bombing raids;
its population decimated.
Following the fall of Hitler,
her early Nazi-informed
worldview inevitably came
up against the blunt reality
of life in Allied-occupied
Germany. At the age of 15,
when working as a temp for
the US Air Force, she was
raped by an African-Ameri-
can GI, who had also raped
a number of other employees;
originally keeping quiet about
it, the crime was eventually
discovered, and Christa was
made to give evidence. He
was sentenced to death, and
shot.
And this is why I think the
term ‘problematic’ is a poor
choice to use when describing
Nico. How can it encompass
the entirety of her traumatic
upbringing? A war that left
her father dead by his own
hand; a childhood spent in
bombed-out cities; an adoles-
cence marked by being raped
and then indicted in her
rapist’s killing. While these
factors don’t excuse her racist
behaviour, they can explain
it in a way that merely calling
Nico ‘problematic fave’ can
never do.
The word ‘problematic’ has,
like ‘liberal elite’ or ‘will of the
people’, today just become
another meaningless buz-
zword in our online lexicon.
It smooths away all the tricky
complexities of the power
structures inherent within
society, leaving no room for
nuance; by calling someone
or something ‘problematic’,
what we are really doing,
deep down, is emphasising
that we are not. We place
the onus of responsibility for
\\ I think it’s remiss
not to look at
how Nico’s racism
developed \\
behaviour entirely on the
individual person, and refuse
to critically examine the struc-
tural issues at hand.
To me, calling Nico a ‘prob-
lematic fave’, and leaving it
at that, is a double injustice: it
doesn’t do justice to her tragic
life story, one pockmarked
by suffering and strife, and
it doesn’t do justice to those
most affected by racism, since
it refuses to challenge the
status quo at a level higher
than the individual. It exoner-
ates us from the responsibility
of interrogating the structural
problems that lead to some
parts of society profiting at
the expense of others.
Can we separate the artist
from the art? I’m not really
sure if this is possible or not.
But what I am sure about is
that I will continue to enjoy
Nico’s work, despite her
‘problematic’ aspects. I will
continue to feel chills down
my spine at her raw inter-
pretation of The Doors’ ‘The
End’; I will continue to skip the
tracks on ‘The Velvet Under-
ground and Nico’ that don’t
feature her teutonic vocals
(soz Lou Reed); and I will con-
tinue to feel a discomforting
mixture of sadness and hope
during the beautifully-sim-
ple song ‘Afraid’. Nico’s art
stretches far beyond a couple
of songs on a Warhol-pro-
duced LP, and the structural
racism that is entrenched in
society stretches far beyond
the short pithy syllables of
‘problematic’.

So it’s Sunday; I’m tending
to some life admin, such as
paying rent, doing laundry,
binge-watching Gilmore Girls,
you know, the usual. All of a
sudden an amazing cover of
I Drove All Night (originally
by legendary Céline Dion)
comes up on the radio and I
just have to know who it’s by.
So I whip out my phone, open
Shazam and… well shazam
the shit out of the song until
it’s registered and BOOM:
I Drove All Night (B Side)
\\ The Maccabees \\ 129
shazams.
Content once again, I put
the phone back in my pocket,
when it hits me. I NEVER
ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING
WITH THIS INFORMATION.
So I immediately open
Shazam again and realise
I’d fallen into this pattern
over a year ago. There were
dozens of great songs that I
had successfully identified but
never purchased or actively
incorporated into a playlist.
Things like Swedish folk
(My Silver Lining by First Aid
the Twin Peaks soundtrack
with Aphex Twin, Beyoncé,
and smack in the middle,
Feist.
I’ve listened to this mix
dozens of times and half
of them I’ve rewinded and
broken the flow of it just to
hear Feist’s divine, smooth,
melting voice call to my soul,
encouraging it to keep itself
afloat. I once even stepped
out of the shower just to
rewind the mix back to Feist.
And now, finally, I can just
put it on repeat and I can
refer to it by more than just
that little bird song (But why
didn’t you just shazam the mix
when Fe – Shhhhhhh)
So don’t be an idiot like
me kids. If you’re gonna be
the guy that walks up to a
speaker, phone first, while
asking an entire room of
people to shut up so that you
can shazam something, at
least put that song in a play-
list at some point.

A
waken,
Gambino is
back! Apart
from doing
his regular
mixtape
releases it has been a while
since Childish Gambino
has released an album to
the public. It can be said
that Gambino has evolved
into a completely different
artist since his 2013 debut
of Because of the Internet,
which was heavily rap based,
with standard R&B backbeats
rhythm and the instrumental
role. The sound, although
new and fresh, reminds of
70s disco due to the heavy
funk influence, especially Boo-
gieman, where I can clearly
hear sounds which remind
me of Kool and the Gang’s
Open Sesame. You can
clearly tell that Gambino has
taken inspiration from several
artists throughout the creation
of this album to achieve the
complexity of sounds that he
has. From rock and gospel
influences in Me and your
Mama to heavy synth sounds
in Redbone, which sounds
similar to something you
would hear from Daft Punk,
I believe Gambino takes you
on a musical journey through-
out this album.
Many of the track titles seem
to be directed at Gambino’s
son, with many referring to
the boy’s mother and some
directly to him. The lyrics of
the track Baby Boy speak of
the relationship Gambino
hopes to have with his son
as he sings, “Don’t take my
baby boy”, which may be a
listener to interpret the mood
of the situation without the
bias of spoken lyrics.
From acting roles to screen-
writing to musical creator,
Childish Gambino excels
throughout, and this album
is no different. Awaken, My
Love! takes us through a
whirlwind of funk exploration,
which I gladly embarked
upon.

Kit and yes it’s exactly what
is sounds like), electrodance
(Forever And Ever by Boogie
Belgique) and English art rock
(Worst Band in the World by
10cc). The list goes on and on
and on. I discovered new (to
me) artists like Bauhaus and
Jenny Hval (give her a listen,
she cray) and found gems
that had somehow escaped
me by artists I love, like Kate
Bush’s Houdini – how had I
never heard this masterpiece
before?! I even found some
Buena Vista Social Club
in there (and a Nick Jonas
Song. I ain’t proud).
But possibly the greatest
‘discovery’ was a song I love
by an artist I love, Caught A
Long Wind by Feist. Now the
reason why I’ve used single
quotes is because this song is
part of the Nicolas Jaar BBC
1 essential mix from 2012 that
I listen to almost on a weekly
basis. The mix in itself is a
masterpiece. In two hours it
somehow seamlessly blends
