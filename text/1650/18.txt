T
he Little Matchgirl
is a show populated
by people and
puppets, of which
the eponymous
c h a r a c t e r ,
masterfully operated by Edie
Edmundson,isone. Ourwriter,
Ezra Kitson, was fortunate
enough to speak with her after
the performance.
Edmundson was drawn
to puppetry by a National
Theatre production of Phillip
Pullman’s His Dark Materials
where she realised the power
of puppetry in storytelling.
"Puppets require the audience
to use their empathy" and "do
away with the ego" of con-
ventional performance. After
pursuing a drama degree
where she cemented her love
for the theatre, Edmundson, a
graduate of Queen Mary’s,
undertook a a ten week
course at the Curious School
of Puppetry, an institution
she believes “will have an
enormous part to play in the
growth of puppetry in the
UK” . Since her time at the
Curious School, she has taken
shows to Edinburgh Fringe
and honed her craft on the
Movingstage Marionette
Theatre on the Puppet Theatre
Barge, a barge moored in
Little Venice.
Her previous work has
tackled complex issues that
you may not associate with
puppetry. Earlier this year
she staged The Old Woman
Made of Stardust at the N16
Theatre, a story about a
young girl struggling to navi-
gate her grief after the death
of her grandmother, based
partially on a letter Edmund-
son’s grandmother wrote to
her before she passed away.
Along with other puppeteers,
she has been involved in
Wondering Hands, a puppet
company that staged a show
of the same name at the
Brainchild Festival in July this
year. Wondering Hands, the
show, is a piece that aims
to fill the void left by lack of
relevant, useful sex educa-
tion provided by schools. It
explores "consent, gender
and sexuality", using puppets
as an "accessible edge" into
a subject that is often either
veiled in analogy or misrepre-
sented in explicit, exploitative
pornography.
The Little Matchgirl at the
Sam Wanamaker Play-
house is perhaps the most
mainstream attention she’s
the themes in the play are
too dark for a Christmas per-
formance? "Not at all, these
stories have a very important
message, particularly to hear
at Christmas. The tragic end
[of The Little Matchgirl] is still
relevant to our modern world,
with issues of homelessness,
child poverty and refugees.’
There’s a lot to be learnt from
these tales, and the takeaway
message shouldn’t be one of
gloom, but rather thoughtful-
ness and hope."
Given the extraordinary
range of her achievements
since becoming a full-time
puppeteer, we might expect
her star to rise further: “the
dream is to make a living
from puppetry one day! I'd
love to be able to combine
working as a professional job-
bing puppeteer with making
my own work as a writer,
director and performer”
she says of her plans for the
future. Might the Wondering
Hands company be part of
that? She hopes so, adding

received since entering
the world of professional
puppetry in 2015. Given the
finesse of her performance,
it’s hard to believe she is in
such an early stage of her
career. I ask her if it was
daunting to be part of a show
where her puppet is required
to be on stage the whole time,
especially given the intimate
atmosphere of the Sam
Wanamaker. "It’s physically
tiring," she admits; "your
attention has to be fixed on
the puppet's movements, but
at the same time you have
to constantly watch with
peripheral vision to dodge
the flailing limbs all around
you." The candle lit stage
also adds an incendiary risk
– especially when holding
a wooden puppet with long
dry hair – but despite this,
Edie finds the whole thing
very exciting: "a great feature
of the Sam Wanamaker is
that the lighting is the same
for both the performers and
the actors, and this creates
a shared experience: it’s
lovely to be able to see the
audience and together enjoy
these vibrant stories."
Of the stories that are told
in the show, The Princess
and the Pea is her favourite.
On the surface it’s "funny,
ridiculous and sad" but
there is also a rich moral
aspect, "dealing with trust in
relationships. Does she think
that she is interested the role
puppetry can play in distilling
complex issues, especially in
therapy situations. Edmund-
son’s puppetry is innovative,
and she is on a mission to
make sure the “artform gains
respect and recognition” and
the puppeteers are acknowl-
edged for the skills and
training they must acquire.
“I’ve been incredibly lucky to
get this part” she says of her
Little Matchgirl performance,
not all her colleagues are so
lucky. “Many skilled, trained
puppeteers lose out on jobs
to actors with little or no
puppetry experience.” That
may not be the case for long
though: “puppetry is having
a bit of a renaissance at the
moment thanks to shows
like War Horse”, she says.
Edmundson aims to be part
of that renaissance, working
with Wondering Hands to
bring the Victoriana artform
to the 21st
century – you read
it here first, the puppet revolu-
tion starts now.

The Duke |
Innovative

theatre
S
hôn Dale-Jones’
The Duke is about
what we are
willing to pay
for the things we
treasure. What
is the value of a collectible
piece of porcelain, of a script
you’ve been working on for
ten years, of a seat on a boat
that is as likely to plunge
you into the sea as to deliver
you to safety? In the one-
hour, one man show, Dale-
Jones explores these issues,
both personal and global,
with humour, empathy, and
considerable power.
Dale-Jones greets each
audience member as they
arrive at the relatively small
venue of Jerwood Theatre
Upstairs with a handshake
and a word of thanks, when
everyone has taken their seat,
he takes his own place at a
desk set up on stage. In The
Royal Court, the desk is at the
front of a timber box, not his
own set, Dale-Jones tells the
audience, but that of the show
that will be following him; it is
this spirit of frugality of stag-
ing, this camp-fire story vibe
that characterises the rest of
the performance. Dale-Jones
voices all his characters of
which there are few; himself,
his mother, his script writing
instructor, as well some others
who appear fleetingly in the
retelling. From a laptop, he
also adds a soundtrack; a fun
mix of pop music that sets the
scene, as well as a dramatic
score for a the more tense
moments of the story.
‘The Duke’ Dale-Jones
tells us, refers to a 'Royal
Worcester limited edition
porcelain figure of the Duke
of Wellington on horseback',
one of a set of four, a figurine
that was bought by his late
father as an investment at a
sum of £750 (over £8000
in today’s money), when
Dale-Jones was young.The
Duke remained bound in
sponge under the bed, the
focus of father-son bonding
throughout Dale-Jones’ child-
hood.This is the background,
the audience are told. The
story proper follows that of
Dale-Jones deciding whether
to make crucial changes to
a script that he has been
working on for a decade –
changes that would offer a
chance to get it turned into a
film. The changes demanded
are outlandish; Anglesey
must become Manhattan,
the principal character must
change all of their distinguish-
ing features, and the script

should heavily feature Audi
TT coupes. In the midst of this,
a phone-call arrives from his
ageing mother in which she
admits to accidentally break-
ing The Duke. Thus begins a
tale recounting the recovery
of The Duke of Wellington,
Dale-Jones’ realisation of how
treasured his time with his
mother has become now he
sees that it is limited.
“I am no longer able to see
the world I once did," admits
Dale-Jones at the beginning
of the performance. The
audience is sombre, none
of us can. Throughout the
retelling of The Duke, new
reports of Syrian refugees
haunt Dale-Jones as he waits
for an work email, he hears of
several families drowning off
the Greek coast, and thinks of
how much they must've paid
for a chance to get on the
boat in the first place: their
entire life savings perhaps,
at one point he encounters a
young refugee mother, and is
lost as to how to reply when
she tells him she does not
know whether her husband is
alive or dead. In one of the
most emotional scenes, at the
end, he watches his elderly
mother who has joined a
rowing club, get into a boat
– a moment of empowerment
for her – and thinks of all the
mothers for whom the action
is not a matter of staving off
loneliness, but of life and
death.
The story, simple at its core,
has fantastical flourishes.
Dale-Jones explains these
with a Louis Buñuel quote
at the start of the perfor-
mance: "Fantasy and reality
are equally personal, and
equally felt, so their confusion
is only a matter of relative
importance." In this spirit,
imagination and truth are
blended in the retelling of
Dale-Jones’ accounts; some
details are far fetched, but
each new twist is told with
such clarity, such earnestness,
that it doesn’t matter, it is
indistinguishable from what
may actually have happened.
The Duke is a tour de force
performance, revealing
Dale-Jones as a consummate
storyteller, able to conjure up
scenes and characters out of
thin air before the audience’s
eyes. He is persuasive too;
the need to urgently do
something about the crises
the world finds itself in is
made clear; but Dale-Jones
isn’t lecturing from the top
of his “liberal elite” ivory
tower; tickets to The Duke are
free, after the performance,
collection buckets for Save
the Children are handed
around. The Duke is about
the worth of things; objects,
experiences, it shows us the
worth of art – the power it
has to spin something out
of nothing and create real
change in the world. Real
charity, Dale-Jones tells the
audience is "when it hurts just
a bit." Dale-Jones could've
charged market price for
the tickets and donated his
earnings, instead he uses The
Duke to ask each audience
member personally: what are
you willing to pay for chance
to make the a world a little bit
better?
