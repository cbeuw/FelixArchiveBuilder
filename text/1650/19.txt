version of Top Gear. The
hosts retain their signature
irreverence, although they
do seem a bit more haggard
than usual. Thankfully though,
despite going international,
Clarkson, May, and Ham-
mond retain their Britishness
and British sense of humour.
At first, it seems as if they’re
struggling to adapt to the
new format, but they quickly
fall into the old grooves that
made them so successful in
the first place.
Despite its flaws, The Grand
Tour is an amicable successor
to the Top Gear of old. It
certainly blows Chris Evans’
monstrosity out of the water.

It’s always nice to see a
vibrant and energetic adven-
ture, especially considering
that Snyder’s upcoming Jus-
tice League movie is expected
to have his usual dark and
gritty style.
As in any superhero team
up, the real fun is seeing the
different characters interact
and watching their person-
alities clash. Whether it was

aving four shows
set in a shared
universe and
on the same
channel meant
a crossover was
inevitable. It was certainly
ambitious, especially on a TV
network budget, but I’m glad
to say they were able to pull
it off.
With a diverse range of
characters from DC comics,
the crossover is essentially a
Justice League movie. They
even have their own Hall of
Justice! The plot was fairly
and Heatwave’s brief but
hilarious interactions, or
Flash and Arrow drinking
together and bonding over
their experiences, there was
never a dull moment. One
critique was taking the focus
off Supergirl in the later act of
story. I hope that, later down
in the road, the producers
make a smaller scale crosso-
ver, just to see more banter
between the heroes.
A problem with crossovers
is that they usually put the
heroes’ individual stories
aside to focus on the larger
picture. While the invasion
was the major feature here,
the episodes were still written
to allow some individuality
in each of them. Arrow’s
episode in particular barely
featured the crossover,
instead telling the usual story
of the hero being placed in a
perfect life scenario. The epi-
sode worked better for it, with
some tear jerking scenes and
a great look at seeing how
far the characters of Arrow
had come.
The overarching invasion
storyline starts off a little slow
case. The action sequences
were on point and impressive
during the climactic scenes,
with dozens of heroes and
aliens fighting while Flash and
Supergirl raced across the
Earth. Just seeing a massive
line-up of DC icons standing
together was thrilling, in and
of itself.
Though there might have
been a few hiccups along
the way, the crossover ulti-
mately made great use of the
premise and exceeded all
expectations. The only thing
you’ll be wondering once
you’ve watched it is when the
next one will be.
but kicks into gear in the final
act. The aliens are actually
given motivations and aren’t
just portrayed as stereotypi-
cal bad guys, as is usually the
Invasion!

as the show still seems very
much geared to a traditional

Also, I hate the new track
driver. Clearly brought
on board in some sort of
vain attempt to draw in
the American audiences,
this ex-NASCAR driver’s
grating feigns at comedy are
frequently frustrating and
always atrocious.
However, The Grand Tour

T
op Gear is dead. Long
Live Top Gear? Following
Jeremy Clarkson’s, lets
face it, rightful dismissal
from the BBC and the
subsequent decline of
Top Gear’s quality, fans have been
hanging their hopes on The Grand
Tour. Thankfully, the new series
does not disappoint. Well, mostly.
The series begins with an
extended, tongue-in-cheek
segment that sets the tone for the
show: bigger, more expensive, and
just a little bloated. No attempts
are made to disguise the fact that
it’s meant to be a Top Gear killer.
Even the logo itself is a ‘GT’, a
reversal of Top Gear.
The new shtick is essentially an
attempt to emulate the successes of
the Top Gear specials, with each
episode taking place in a different
country, and having a different
theme.
That’s part of the problem. A
large part of the charm of those
specials was organic, coming from
the hosts interactions. Here, too
much scripting is used in a hollow
attempt to replicate those highs. As
a result, jokes often overstay their
welcome and clearly staged
interactions become obvious
and unfunny.
The team are starting to
show their age a bit as well,
