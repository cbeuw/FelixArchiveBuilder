O
n a frosty
December
morning,
two teams
of Imperial
sailors set
out for a weekend of racing in
Bristol. With time to spare for
the journey down we enjoyed
a leisurely first leg, including
a pleasant stop at one of the
M4’s finest service stations.
Unfortunately, the stop
quickly descended into ICSM
rugby-style carnage, as Joe
wrenched the sliding doors
off their rollers. With yet more
brute force the problem was
solved and we continued on
our way.
Some time later and the
first day of sailing got under
way. This consisted of a
‘round robin’ with the two

F
rom Friday the
25th
November to
Sunday the 27th
, the
streets of Sheffield
were invaded by
ninjas. More than
650 jitsukas (the name given
to those that practice JiuJitsu)
from all over the UK gathered
during the weekend for the
Atemi National Competition.
First of all, what is JiuJitsu?
It’s a super-awesome Japa-
nese martial art which is all
about taking your opponent’s
balance and controlling it.
You start as a novice (white
belt), then level up through
the colours of the rainbow to
brown. If you’ve made it that
far you can become a scary
black belt! You learn numer-
ous ways to throw somebody
on the floor and completely
dominate them with locks on
arms, legs, ankles, wrists –
anything really.
The weekend was split
between training on Saturday
and Sunday morning (for
those who can jitsu their way
through a hangover) and
competition in the afternoon,
with a video game themed
party on Saturday evening
and a massive 650 person
Mannequin challenge to top
it all off. All the participants
were divided into their respec-
tive belt colours, and each
participant had to demon-
strate their technique in a
‘Gauntlet’ and a ‘V’:
The Gauntlet: walk between
two lines of people, who
are going to attack you
(with punches, blunt knives,
wooden sticks and swords)
one after the other. Fun. This
is where you show off how
beautifully and safely you can
apply a technique.
The V: two lines of people
standing in a V, an instructor
at its end is going to send
people to attack you at the
pace they seem appropriate:
fast and furious (no relation).
This is where you demonstrate
how you deal with pressure,
and how fast you can subdue
an opponent, it’s kind of scary
but you get used to it.
Saturday morning, survi-
vors (everybody except the
President and VP of the club)
Imperial teams sailing against
randomly selected teams
from other universities, before
being placed into bronze,
silver and gold leagues for
the next stage of the com-
petition. The well-practiced
Imperial Blue team had a
great morning, getting mul-
tiple wins under their belts,
with the afternoon following
a similar pattern. For the less
experienced Imperial Whites,
highlights included our soli-
tary win of the day against
Bristol White, and lunch,
during which Calvin and I
shared a deliciously filled
pie. The first day also saw a
grudge match between the
Imperial Blues and Whites,
with the Blues coming out on
top by only one place.
Heading back to our over-
night accommodation both
teams bore witness to some
of Bristol’s grimiest student
houses, before leaving again
for a night of Indian food and
cheap booze. The next day
saw the Blues put in some
very strong performances.
Due to the stiff competition
they faced in the gold league,
the Blues ended the day
unable to add to their tally
of wins – though they more
than deserved to. For the
Whites, it seemed our luck
had changed. Placed in the
bronze league, we finally
got to sail against teams
of a similar standard (half
our team had never sailed
in a competition before).
We narrowly missed out on
beating our training partners,
the University of London
1s, and after switching up
crews, secured two wins – we
destroyed UWE by crossing
the line in first, second and
third. A narrow victory over
Solent Red by one place
meant we placed 3rd
in our
group.
A fantastic weekend
was had by all, with some
top-quality sailing. If we’ve
inspired you to give sailing
a go, get in contact with us
on Facebook or email us at
sailing@imperial.ac.uk. We’ve
got something for everyone,
regardless of ability!
Fraser Goldsworth
trained and competitors who
made it through the two
rounds on Friday got to go
through the final round in the
afternoon, where one of our
green belts beasted her way
through to Gold. The highlight
of the weekend was watching
a junior grading. Nothing like
seeing five year olds throwing
people twice their size.

T
he IC Football 3s
finally settled who
the best of the
bunch is in ICUAFC
with a deserving
3-2 win in a club
friendly over the 2s.
Even though this game was
of little importance to anyone
outside of the club, the pres-
sure was on for both teams as
pride was at stake for the 2s
captain, Fraser Read, should
his side have failed to get the
win. The current league posi-
tions are shown below.
The opening exchanges
were dominated by the 2s,
trying to establish an early
hold on the game. Although
the 3s knew they had quality
on their side (well maybe not
Loic Alix-Brown), they per-
haps did not have the belief

C games versus the
Medics are always
fierce contests and this
was no different. The
game started off pretty
cagey with little quality,
a bit of a West Bromwich
Albion and Hull City game,
both sides didn’t want to give
anything away. The game
needed a bit of spark and
that was provided when Jack
Nicholls slid a ball through
to Ryan Jude who sent the
defender for a bag of hot
chips and a sausage roll and
then buried the finish. The 6s
then turned from West Brom
into Barcelona and turned
on the charm. We won the
ball back from kick off and
Ryan had his man on toast
again, got to the by-line and
forced an own goal. Charlie
Powell then pinged a corner
in and Jack punted one from
the edge of the box low and
hard and beat the keeper,
3-0 and in complete control.
Then in the aftermath of a set
piece, Neil Leisner wrapped
his Mr Tickle leg round a
loose ball and hit a half volley
into the top corner that was
arguably better than Marco
van Basten’s volley against
Russia in 1988 – absolute
belter. Medics then pulled
one back but the goal
difference was restored soon
after. A ball was headed out
from a corner and the last
man back, left-back Elliott
Boyes unleashed an absolute
netbuster from 30 yards that
ripped into the top right bin.
Different gravy. We walked
into half time feeling like
millionaires and the game felt
killed off at 5-1. To be fair to
them, the Medics did turn up
in the second half to pull two
back; it was a bit of a backs
against the wall performance
but Paolo held it together and
we saw out the game at 5-3.
The introduction of Omar
Inuwa with 20 minutes to
play added a bit of pace and
strength to the attack but his
to transfer this skill to the
game. There were few clear
cut chances and most of the
early efforts on the 3s goal
were speculative from range.
As the half continued, the
3s grew into the game and
kept more possession of the
ball, looking stronger going
forward.
As is the way with many
a big game (looking at you
United) the first half had
promised much, but delivered
little, ending 0-0.
With the half time break
and Andrew Miller’s usual
inspirational speech over, the
second half began.
Disaster struck almost
instantly for the 3s, with right
back and all round good guy
Douglas Paterson falling fowl
to a dodgy hamstring and
being forced to come off.
Who knew that this would
spark an outpour of goals in
the game: the 2s struck first
with a smart finish to take the
lead. The 3s showed strong
resilience and bounced back
with 2 goals in quick succes-
sion, the second of which
was heavily disputed by the
opposition due to what they
felt was a foul on the keeper.
It would appear that some
cosmic force was in play,
because shortly after, the
2s levelled the game with a
similarly dubious goal where
the keeper appeared to be
fouled.
With the game poised at
2-2 there was no room for
error. A couple of chances
came and went for both sides
and the game was as open
as it had been since the start.
With just minutes remaining,
the ball fell to Loic’s feet, who
masterfully beat his man and
sent a beautiful delivery into
the middle. Waiting to knock
it home was star striker Stan-
ley Ho to make it 3-2.
Euphoria for the 3s.

Doug Paterson
lack of game time in recent
weeks showed. From his first
touch you would think he had
lego bricks for feet. In all it
was a good win in a derby
game, with the 6s now easily
ahead of the Medics in the
league.
