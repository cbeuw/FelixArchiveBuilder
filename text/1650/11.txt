David Lynch’s Blue Velvet, being
reissued for the 30th
anniversary
this month, introduced the world
to the themes that would run
throughthedirector’sworkforthe
next three decades. A stunning
worldofglamourandgrime,Blue
Velvet is a masterpiece.
D
egraded,
slapped around,
humiliated and
undressed in
front of the
camera” wrote
Roger Ebert, esteemed
American film reviewer,
of Isabella Rossellini’s
performance in David Lynch’s
1986 film Blue Velvet. “When
you ask an actress to endure
those experiences, you should
keep your side of the bargain
by putting her in an important
film.” Ebert’s feelings on
the film – which were
resoundingly negative – were
unchanged up until his death
in 2013, but clearly many
people disagree: last week
saw the re-release of the 30th
anniversary edition of Blue
Velvet. Today, Blue Velvet
stands among one of the
greatest films of the 1980s,
and marked a turning point
in David Lynch’s illustrious
and beguiling career. Call it
masochistic, pretentious, or
even misogynistic if you want
– just don’t call it unimportant.
Blue Velvet revolves around
the duality of everyday life,
inviting us to take a peek
underneath the surface of the
Reaganesque fantasy of the
American dream. In its much-
loved opening sequence, we
are introduced to a world of
white picket fences, smiling
firemen, and lush green
lawns. This is dramatically
interrupted when a man
watering his front garden
suddenly collapses; the hose
spurts serpentine arcs of
water as the man lies helpless
in the mud.
We find out that this man
is the father of Jeffrey Beau-
mont, played by long-time
Lynch collaborator Kyle
MacLachlan, who is made to
return to Lumberton, North
Carolina – a town whose
radio station welcomes us
with a dawn chorus of “logs,
logs, logs!”. On the way back
from the hospital he stumbles
across a severed human ear,
and this is the point where his
troubles begin. Pretty soon he
finds himself trapped between
two different women: the
sweet girl-next-door, Sandy
(Laura Dern), daughter of the
local detective; and Dorothy
Vallens (Isabella Rossellini),
an abused nightclub singer,
whose husband and child
have been taken hostage.
Jeffrey soon finds himself
tripping down a rabbit hole
of secrets, unearthing the
dark elements of society that
lurk just beneath a well-to-do
façade, and running into
Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper),
a vicious psychopath who
huffs on amyl nitrite and vio-
lently abuses Dorothy. While
another director may take a
straightforward approach to
the plotline, Lynch eschews
easy resolution, instead
subverting the film noir genre
to create a finished piece
where nothing quite adds up.
Certain characters pop up in
a single scene, and then are
never seen again, while some
loose ends remain untied by
the time the credits roll, in an
intentional attempt to chal-
lenge the viewer.
From the very beginning
of Blue Velvet, Lynch sets out
a template of themes that
he has followed over the
last three decades: the ugly
underbelly of of violence
lying behind polite society
that’s running through 1990’s
Wild at Heart; the portrayal
of dichotomies. In Blue Velvet
we have the two protag-
onists, Jeffrey and Sandy,
who exude an all-American
charm, a tremendous vitality
that seems to come from a
diet of red meat, milk and
wholesomeness. They are
contrasted dramatically with
the sleazy, sad coupling of
Frank and Dorothy, a rela-
tionship defined by rape and
abuse. There’s even a schism
spatially, with Lumberton split
right down the middle by
Lincoln Avenue, which marks
the meeting points of the
calm suburban world of wine
and roses, and the run-down
apartment blocks and aban-
doned factories that mark the
other side of town. But while
the first half hour of the film
sets up these archetypical
characters, Lynch spends the
remainder of the film demol-
ishing all boundaries between
the two worlds, bringing
them crashing together in a
disorientating maelstrom. It’s
the same technique he uses in
Mulholland Drive, when the
two separate plotlines begin
to coincide with each other,
or in Twin Peaks, where the
lines between the natural and
supernatural bleed into each
other.
Similarly, Lynch sets up a
visual dichotomy, with the
deep blues of club interiors
playing off against the red
curtains that would become a
signature element of his films.
Darkness and light play key
roles in the film: when we are
first introduced to Sandy, she
comes shining out of the dark
like a beacon of hope, while
the film’s seemingly happy
conclusion is marked by a
brilliant flash of white. For
Lynch, visual motifs are more
than mere aesthetic elements,
but instead reflect a deeper,
symbolic meaning, that
has made his work ripe for
interpretation – from Michael
Atkinson’s Freudian take on
Blue Velvet to Laura Mulvey’s
argument that the central trio
of Frank, Dorothy, and Jeffrey
represent the Oedipal family
unit. Like the French director
Alain Resnais, Lynch’s work
refuses to conform to a single
explanation, making it all the
richer.
Where Blue Velvet is
perhaps most important,
however, is in its soundtrack:
the film marked the first
collaboration between Lynch
and composer Angelo Bada-
lamenti, with whom he would
work again and again. Bada-
lamenti composed half of
the tracks on the soundtrack,
which create an eerie sound-
scape that weaves its course
throughout the film, never
overplaying its hand; for
the remainder of the tracks,
Badalamenti chose a series of
vintage pop songs, which per-
fectly accentuate the physical

or about the first
90 minutes of The
Unknown Girl, I sat
rather unimpressed
in my leather chair
in one of the small
theaters at Soho Screening
Rooms. Then, as the last half
hour unfolded, directors Jean-
Pierre and Luc Dardenne tied
together multiple plot lines
like a beautiful bow on a
Christmas present.
Without spoiling the ending,
the film centres around Dr.
Jenny Davin, played by actor
Adèle Haenel, who hears
someone knocking on her
front door to her practice.
Because it is late at night,
Davin feels uncomfortable
answering. The next day,
at a nearby river.
Davin, feeling immense
guilt, makes it her mission to
find out who this girl was,
and for the rest of the film
the Dardenne brothers take
us through a strange roller
coaster of a story – except
that coaster splits up on to
multiple tracks, until the last
30 or so seconds, when the
cars join to finish on one line.
The film’s main strength,
besides its satisfying finish,
is how it is always focused
through the lens of Davin’s
character: we are with her
throughout every step of her
journey to find out who this
‘unknown girl’ is. And boy, it’s
a strange, unpredictable and
exciting ride.
The initial reviews of The
Unknown Girl, however, have
not been kind, with many
critics citing a predictable
narrative and a lack of
excitement. Perhaps this is
due to the fact that many
English-speaking critics
expect much more from for-
eign films, but for me – while
these criticisms are certainly
fair enough for the first 90
minutes – the ending is so
well-orchestrated that I real-
ised why the rest of the movie
was made the way it is.
One of the main themes
\\ The Dardenne
brothers tie together

present \\
throughout the film is truth.
At first, multiple characters
do not wish to disclose what
they know, where they were,
or what they were doing
the night of the girl’s death.
Meanwhile, in a separate
case, Jamie’s intern Julien –
played by Olivier Bonnaud
– tells Jamie personal infor-
mation, as an explanation for
why he quit his dream to be a
doctor.
It is in these closing scenes
that we feel a sense of
intimacy, and step deeper
into these people’s lives. I
felt like I was right there with
Davin, hearing their stories
and becoming emotionally
exhausted, despite the fact
this is a fiction.
Again, I won’t dive too
much into the plot, because I
don’t want to ruin the delayed
gratification that you may
experience if you do choose
to invest just under two hours
to watch this movie. But I will
say that if you want a movie
that makes you think about
the importance of telling
the truth, The Unknown Girl
articulates it in an interesting
way. And, being a reporter
by trade, finding the truth is a
theme I can appreciate in any
movie I watch.

go on to work with Lynch in
five of his films and – most
notably – in his TV series Twin
Peaks, whose soundtrack
has since reached cult status,
and was reissued this year on
Death Waltz records.
While David Lynch’s career
may have properly gotten
started with Eraserhead,
his first feature film, made
in 1977, it wasn’t until Blue
Velvet that he set down
the off-kilter template he
continues to follow to this
day. Navigating between the
worlds of surrealism and natu-
ralism, Lynch’s work achieves
a sense of unease that no
other director working today
can match. Blue Velvet is a
stunning film; beautiful, mean-
ingful, and most definitely
important.
