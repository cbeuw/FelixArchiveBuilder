ranscranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) is
a technique currently
used in the treatment
of migraines and
depression. It
involves stimulating the part
of the brain that is linked
to reward and pleasure.
Patients undergoing treatment
for depression may receive
numerous sessions of TMS, but
it is unknown as to whether
their sex drive is altered as a
result.
A new study directly looking
at libido suggests that this
may be the case. The area of
the brain involved in pleasure
was stimulated in 20 people
for 20 minutes. This involved
strapping a vibrator to either
the penis or clitoris of the
volunteer, and monitoring the
strength of alpha brain waves
via electrodes attached to
the individual’s head. Alpha
waves are generally weaker
during sexual arousal. This
group was split into two: one
received excitatory TMS, and
the other inhibitory. In other
words, the excitatory group
had the pleasure region of
their brain stimulated while
the other did not.
The researchers then mon-
itored the effects of sexual
arousal on the level of sexual
desire. Each volunteer was
left alone in a room, with
a vibrator that they could
control themselves. They
had to press the button as
quickly as possible when a
shape appeared on a screen.
Depending on their speed
of response, they would be
stimulated after a pause.
The strength of the alpha
waves during this waiting
period were the most impor-
tant find. Individuals that were
part of the excitatory group
had weaker alpha waves
than those that were not. They
were more sexually aroused
with the expectation of stim-
ulation. Therefore, the brain
waves can be seen as an ana-
logue to sexual desire, and so

or most, a visit to
Hyde Park engenders
feelings of tranquility
and relaxation.
Going for a walk in
this urban wilderness
at the heart of London
would provide anyone with
the “escape” that we city
dwellers crave, whether we
know it or not. As a biologist,
I certainly identify myself as
a regular park visitor, always
admiring the flora, observing
wildlife and I’ve come to
familiarize myself with the
ecosystem. However, nothing
could have prepared me for
what I witnessed a few weeks
ago.
I had just arrived at the Ser-
pentine Bar when I stopped
for a bit of bird watching.
After some time, a lone
seagull stealthily approached
one group of pigeons on the
shore. This did not seem
out of the norm until the
gull suddenly sprinted
at the smallest of
the pack, dragged
the poor creature
into the water and
began viciously
pecking at it. At first,
this seemed like a
territorial attack, but
as the assault persisted,
it became clear the inten-
tion was to kill. It felt like a
horrific scene out of Planet
Earth. The encounter lasted
for around ten minutes. Unex-
pectedly, the seagull went
on to eat its victim, which, as
you can imagine, did nothing
to help my now greatly dis-
turbed psyche. It felt like I’d
just witnessed murder. None-
theless, my scientific nature
was curious to know why this
was happening.
A local birdwatcher, Ralph
Hancock, had also taken notice
of this notorious creature, having
first spotted it over five years
ago. As it turns out, seagulls
are known to develop new
hunting strategies if their
existing methods are
unsuccessful, however,
in this case, there was
no clear motivation for
change in eating habits.
Due to their webbed
feet, they do not have the
strength to hold, let alone kill,
a pigeon on the ground, hence
drowning them in water. This gull
started out by diving onto prey
flying below from the top of the
Serpentine Bar. This technique
was, however, insufficient, lead-
ing the bird to switch to running
at prey on the shore and drag-
ging them into the water.
Interestingly, some North

American gull populations

neighboring chicks, because
fish, their main food source,
have followed plankton to
deeper colder waters in
response to rising temper-
atures. In our case the true
reasons behind the violent
cannibalistic behaviour may
remain a mystery. If you
would like to tackle that
question yourself or simply
have an interest watching
in mother nature in her full,
merciless force, head over
to the Serpentine and keep
a sharp eye. The Seagull
you’ll be looking for won’t
be too hard to spot, as it
has an unnaturally muscular
physique.
the sex drive of the excitatory
group was increased.
However, it is not known
whether there were any
changes in the sex lives of
the volunteers after the study.
Their sexual responsiveness,
however, did increase. The
number of orgasms experi-
enced rose over the next few
days.
Whether this also occurs
with depression patients is
unknown. The researchers
are keen to find out, given
that this outcome may be a
factor in the effectiveness of
treatment.
