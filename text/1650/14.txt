L
ast year, I wrote
about Pirelli turning
over a new leaf; its
2016 edition had
come on the heels of
Playboy announcing
that it would no longer
feature nudity. What a
winter of discontent, I said,
for the meninists, won’t
someone please think of all
those poor men fighting for
a world where old white
dudes can hold more power
economically, socially, and
politically? It seems the
universe is not a fan of gentle
sarcasm; the meninists have
had the last laugh.
They might’ve taken Amer-
ica, but by Jove, they won’t
have Pirelli. Last year, the tyre
company's annual calendar,
which has become a fashion
photography touchstone,
theretofore known as a
bastion of soft-porn, shifted its
focus from the perfect body
to perfect accomplishments.
The 2016 edition featured
Serena Williams (a great
mix of perfect accomplish-
ment and perfect body), Ava
DuVernay, Patti Smith, Fran
Leibovitz amongst others.
"How would they top this?" I
wondered, then – surely the
only way would be to feature
Ruth Bader Ginsburg as Miss
July? Peter Lindbergh, this
year’s photographer, may not
have taken all my advice to
heart, but has stuck with the
general theme of not objecti-
fying women set last year. He
features a roster of actresses
including Julianne Moore,
Helen Mirren, Robin Wright.
All are fully clothed, shot
in tasteful black and white;
according to Lindbergh not
a single wrinkle or blemish
has been magicked away
with a blender brush-happy
touch-up artist.
Lindbergh claims that he
has replaced nudity with emo-
tional nakedness, saying, “it’s
another kind of naked, more
important than body parts.
What is more than being
naked is to show yourself the
71-year-old Helen Mirren
– where’s my prize?" The
fashion industry shouldn’t be
getting pats on the back for
being shining beacons of pro-
gressivism for such lukewarm
actions. Pirelli has done well

way you are.” The sentiment
is laudable, and certainly
the fashion world could do
with less Photoshop, but the
softly lit images of extremely
beautiful actresses (and
Anastasia Ignatova, a lecturer
at the Moscow State Institute
of International Relations)
aren’t nearly as revolution-
ary as Pirelli imagines them
to be; Lindbergh may think
his photographs are “a cry
for beauty today against
the terror of perfection and
youth”, and to be fair to
him, a wide diversity of age
ranges are represented, but
there are not what many
consider 'imperfections' to be
found here. All the women
featured are classically beau-
tiful, slim, cis, able-bodied,
and the overwhelming major-
ity are white. Zhang Zhi, and
Lupita N’yongo, who to the
cynical seems sometimes to
be the only black woman the
fashion world will acknowl-
edge (okay, Naomi Campbell
too) are the only ones to
represent women of colour.
Lindbergh’s pictures are
blandly pretty, they are also
smugly self-satisfied. The
calendar seems to say "I
dared to print a picture of
\\ Classically
beautiful, slim, cis,
able-bodied, and
overwhelming
white \\
Uma Thurman \\ Peter Lindbergh/Pirelli Calendar
to not revert back to their
hyper-sexualised, objectifying
images of yesteryear, but if
we were waiting for Pirelli’s
feminist revolution, this isn’t it.
