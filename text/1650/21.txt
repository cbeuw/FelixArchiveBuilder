Chocolate, Christmas and Cheese
felix visits Rococo Chocolates for a
night of chocolate making paired
with cheese and whiskey
I
f rolling in cash
and taking baths in
champagne in a mansion
in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat
is your lifetime goal,
may I suggest a better
alternative: earning an OBE
for “services to chocolate”.
Why did I suddenly draw
light to this matter? All after
an inspiring evening of choc-
olate with Chantal Coady
OBE, the creative director
and founder of Rococo
Chocolates, a proudly British,
London based chocolate
company.
It started off with a perfectly
unexciting Wednesday in
college, struggling to keep
my eyes open in front of a
handful of lecture recordings.
After an additional few hours
of messy doodling (which was
supposed to be an engineer-
ing drawing of a pressure
vessel), I wrapped up,
marched past the glittering
Harrods, a few shiny cars and
an array of luxury brands on
Sloane Street, and around the
corner to the quiet Motcombe
Street where the doors of
Rococo Chocolates stood.
By then it was already
six o’clock. The skies had
darkened and the navy blue
doors blended in with the
cold December blackness. Yet
the display window shone like
a warm, bright star: boxes
of chocolates laid across the
window sill in their signature
white-and-blue patterned
coat, tied around by bright
orange ribbons. A small
Christmas tree stood dressed
in red and gold baubles
amongst a string of glittering
fairy lights.
I pushed open the door
gently and entered the shop.
It felt like stepping back in
time – from the street of
modern, soaring house prices
into an old fashioned, country
cottage of a chocolate shop,
reminiscent of those I’ve read
in those wonderful stories
by Roald Dahl. Wooden
cupboards lined up against
the pastel blue coloured
walls, balancing bars upon
bars of chocolate wrapped in
colourful paper. Glass shelves
were stocked full of chocolate
buttons, jelly babies, dainty
pieces of ganache which you
can purchase by the piece.
A few wooden tables stood
by the window, with glasses
of champagne, plates of choc-
olate and platters of mellow,
earthy chocolate tapenade
(yes, CHOCOLATE tapenade)
spread on crackers, ready to
kick off the night.

It took 2 rounds of cham-
pagne for everyone to arrive.
Fashionably late, as bloggers
call it. We were introduced to
the team of young, friendly
team behind the daily
operations of the brand, and
of course, the mastermind:
Chantal. She stood at the end
of the table, smiling in her
clean apron with Rococo’s
signature pattern (taken from
an antique French choco-
late mould catalogue), her
blonde hair cut short, ready
to share her story of Rococo
Chocolates.
The story began with a vivid
excerpt of her childhood
dreams: running around val-
leys of chocolate (think Willy
Wonka’s Chocolate Factory),
collecting chocolates and
sweets in her skirt, then hiding
them under her pillow. She
would then wake up, reach
under her pillow and be dis-
appointed by the absence.
The story quickly jumped to
her days as a squatting Fine
Arts student in the late 70’s,
when she was offered a Sat-
urday job selling Mars bars at
Harrods (and yes, Mars bars
were a luxury back in the
day). She later graduated to
the luxury chocolates section,
wrapping up boxes of creamy
Leonidas to the wealthy, and
on one occasion, Sir Michael
Caine.
After being let go from
Harrods for coming to work
with emerald-coloured hair
and spending a few months
of boredom at an office job,
she set her mind to create
her own magical paradise of
chocolate. Armed with her
strong passion, business skills
from Margaret Thatcher’s
Youth Training Scheme, and
a hefty bank loan (with the
family house as the collat-
eral), she opened the doors
of her first shop on King’s
Road in 1983. Her shop, com-
plete with a sugar chandelier,
fitted into the then rebellious
vibe of Kings Road, fulfilling
the imagination of chocolate
lovers who had come on pil-
grimages to escape the stale,

suffocating, stuffy, depart-
ment stores.
The first ten years wasn’t
easy. They had their ups and
downs, picked themselves up
and continued on their jour-
ney. Their first products were
chocolates produced by small
Belgian and French compa-
nies, until when she came
across Valrhona (a French
specialist chocolate manu-
facturer) which influenced
her to start producing her
own chocolates in 1990. She
got more and more involved
in the chocolate industry,
pushing to remove hydrogen-
ated vegetable fats, artificial
vanilla and excess sugar, and
also founded the Chocolate
Society in 1991, determined
to inject real chocolate into
the market.
A major event in her 25
years in industry was the
bond between Rococo
and Grenada Chocolate
Company. Recognising how
special their chocolate were,
Rococo began importing
small quantities to sell in their
shops in London. When two
hurricanes hit the island of
Grenada in 2004 and 2005,
destroying the majority of
cocoa and nutmeg, Rococo
reached out to GCC, pro-
viding support, funding new
solar driers and building new
bridges. In 2007, they finally
purchasing a small, nine-
acre cocoa farm, naming it
Grococo, where it harvested
fine flavoured, organic cocoa
beans.
Our minds were snapped
back to the present with the
end of the story. But that was
just the start of something
exciting – a chocolate
masterclass!
We were led downstairs to
the small workshop, filling in
the space around the shiny,
marble tabletop. Aprons (in
that gorgeous print of course)
and gloves were distributed,
and the truffle-making half of
the session began. Chantal
quickly rolled out the squares
of chocolate ganache into
spheres, dolloped a spoonful
of warm molten chocolate
in the palm of her hand,
covering the ganache with the
chocolate and placed the ball
into a tray of cocoa powder.
The molten chocolate cooled
to formed a crisp layer
around the cold ganache. We
were urged to follow, rolling
our individual trays of truffles.
The second part was a
more advanced technique –
tempering. By bringing the

Chantal took a large ladleful
of glossy, molten chocolate,
pouring it on the cold marble
table. The chocolate formed
a smooth, flowing ribbon
from the ladle to the marble,
spreading to form a giant,
perfectly circular chocolate
button. She took her shiny
steel scrapers, scraping the
liquid gold from the edge to
the center, working around
the circle with skill and
speed. The temperature had
to be precise, meaning the
mixture had to be warmed
up by adding more molten
chocolate or cooled down by
adding solids. With the tem-
pered chocolate, we made
our own chocolate buttons
and lattice work, using some
silver transfer she had made
before.
With our fingers sticky
with chocolate, we were led
back up to the dining table
for another unique experi-
ence – cheese and chocolate
pairing.
Cheese? Why not? Platters
of chocolate slabs with their
paired cheeses were passed
around: Lancashire with
cardamom white chocolate,
Berkswell with a sea salt,
almond and rosemary milk
chocolate, and Stichelton with
their single origin Dominican
Republic dark chocolate, plus
a sneaky sip of a ten-year
Hazelburn Speyside whiskey.
We nibbled on the combina-
tions, concentrating on the
thrilling palette of flavours
on our tongues. It was a
surprising match, especially
the Lancashire with the sweet,
milky white chocolate and the
exotic hints of cardamom.
We also tried other fla-
voured chocolates they had,
with the most memorable one
being George’s Marvelous
Medicine. Sound familiar?
Yes, the name of one of Roald
Dahl’s most loved books. They
had collaborated with Roald
Dahl in his centenary year
and came up with a range
of chocolates inspired by his
books. The creatives had stud-
ied the stories back to front
and front to back, picking up
sections, sentences, pictures
and words for inspiration.
And for this particular bar,
they exchanged the Golden
Gloss Hair Shampoo, tooth-
paste and Superfoam shaving
cream with an enticing mix of
aniseed, liquorice and fennel,
creating a marvelously medic-
inal taste.
With our minds full of new-
found chocolate knowledge,
and stomachs full of cheese,
quality chocolate and tons
of creativity, we left the shop
(with more chocolate) feeling
much more inspired than the
previous Wednesdays.
Time for me to start recon-
sidering my goals in life.
