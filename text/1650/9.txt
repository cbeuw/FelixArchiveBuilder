A promising future for sustainable transport
Sara Hamilton discusses solutions
that may contribute to a increasingly
clean and green ways of getting
around in the future

emember having

those brick-sized

which generation
upon generation of iPhones
have now replaced? It’s no
news really, that technology
is revolutionizing our lives
everyday. Three news
features this week illustrate
how technology is also
changing the way we
think about something that
has remained relatively
unchanged in our lifetimes:
urban transport.
On the second of December,
the mayors of Paris, Madrid,
Athens and Mexico City
confirmed a joint plan to take
diesel cars and vans off the
roads of their city centres by
2025, in an attempt to tackle
air pollution and reduce
global warming effects.
Although the effects of air
pollution are something we
are all vaguely aware of, not
until recently has the full mag-
nitude of the problem become
uncovered by research. In
fact, as stated by Helena
Molin Valdés, the head of the
United Nations’ climate and
clean air coalition, more than
nine out of ten people world-
wide live in areas where the
air pollution exceeds World
Health Organisation safety
limits, and 3 million premature
deaths are caused by dirty air
yearly, as well as a number
of illnesses, especially among
children. Diesel vehicles have
been rising in a number of
countries for the last couple of
years due to the fact that they
are more economically viable
and burn fuel more efficiently
than petrol engines. However,
these engines produce nitro-
gen dioxide, a detrimental
gas, and small particles that
can remain in the lungs and
are responsible for the major-
ity of air-pollution related
illnesses.
As these cities pledge to
remove diesel vehicles from
their roads, and urge other
leaders to follow suit, the
question that many of us have
is what these diesel free cities
that we might expect to live in
10 years will look like? Elec-
tric cars? Bikes? Clean fuels?
A few major retailers,
including John Lewis, Argos
and Waitrose appear to have
found what could already
become a short-term solution.
They confirmed earlier this
week that some of their
long-distance lorries will
utilize an innovative green
gas to deliver their Christmas
parcels. It consists of a renew-
able biomethane fuel that is
derived from food waste and
can only be used in trucks
with gas engines, less pol-
luting than traditional petrol
and gas ones. CNG Fuel has
reported that not only is it
less polluting and emits 70%
less carbon dioxide than the
current options available on
the market, but it is also 40%
cheaper than diesel. It is the
first biomethane approved for
use under the government’s
Renewable Transport Fuel
Obligation scheme (RTFO),
which has recently been
revisited to include proposals
to incentivize the use of biom-
ethane in transport sector.
Waitrose and John Lewis have
already invested more than
£1m in CNG trucks, and have
already reported a positive
opinion and significant cost
savings.
While clean fuels therefore
present a promising alterna-
tive, others have chosen to
tackle the problem from a
different angle: incentivizing
other clean forms of transport
and aspiring to remove the

need for cars altogether.
A few days ago, London’s
mayor, Sadiq Khan, promised
to spend £770m on cycling
initiatives over the course
of his term, indicating that
he wants to make the bike
a “safe and obvious” form
of transport for Londoners.
This investment amounts to
£17 per day, per person,
per year, which nears that of
predominantly cyclist nations
such as the Netherlands and
Denmark. This sum has associ-
ated with it proposals for two
new cycle super highways,
separated from motor traffic,
one of which would go from
Tower Bridge to Greenwich,
and the other from Olympia
to Hounslow West. This
spending represents 5.5%
of the transport budget for
London, and would also
be extended to expand the
superhighways planned
under Johnson. Maybe the
possibility of Londoners
cycling their daily commute
safely is not far-fetched any
longer.
With the effects of air
pollution becoming imminent
in cities all around the world,
the happy dreams of many
green activists of cities’ parks
replacing highways and all of
us roaming around in electric
cars, might not be so much
a wishful aspiration but a
necessity. It appears that the
eyes of the leaders of cities
worldwide have been open
enough that the realization
of the importance of taking
action has struck. It is now the
time for renewable and clean
technologies to shine and to
partner with businesses to
make them affordable and
available to governments
worldwide. It seems that per-
haps the reality of clean cities
is not that far into the future
after all.
Alexandra Lim questions whether eating burnt food
poses a risk to health, and how these could be avoided
T
he perennial
question. You notice
that slightly-too-
blackened edge of
your fried chicken
thigh during a
friend’s thanksgiving dinner,
and hesitate just a little,
but eat it anyway because
nothing can take that peri-
peri pleasure away from
you. I guess it’s common
knowledge that burnt foods
can be carcinogenic, but did
you know that different burnt
foods pose different levels of
danger?
Foods cooked at high
temperatures for too long end
up harbouring a molecule
called ‘acrylamide’. Although
it is known to be a toxin, the
link between consuming it in
food and developing cancer
is less clear. Acrylamide
itself is formed in a reaction
between the naturally occur-
ring amino acid asparagine,
and carbohydrates. It does
not matter whether or not the
food is organic, but there is a
definite correlation between
high temperatures and acryla-
mide formation. That aside,
a review in 2015 showed
that “dietary acrylamide” is
not related to the risk of the
most common cancers; but
a modest association with
kidney, endometrial and ovar-
ian cancers in people who
had never smoked, couldn’t
be ruled out. Interestingly,
recent studies have proven
that acrylamide formation
is associated more with
carbohydrates rather than
protein-rich foods, such as
we grill and fry because these
foods just taste better, flavour
deepens with the smoky kiss
of the flame, but this doesn’t
mean you should eliminate
these methods from your
Saturday night repertoire
altogether. Heavens no.
The general rule of thumb is
to stop grilling or barbecu-
ing once food has turned
golden-brown– at this point
the meal is cooked enough
to stop you getting food
poisoning, but not cooked too
long where potential cancer
risk could increase. Since
acrylamide does not form in
fruits and vegetables, that are
furthermore less likely to have
these adverse reactions pop
up when in contact with direct
heat anyway, perhaps there’s
a silver lining to all this, and
all you have to do is eat more
of the (healthy) rainbow.
That way, things are easier.
It’s up to you to find the right
balance.
pasta, bread or potatoes, that
are fried, baked or roasted
at temperatures above 120
degrees Celsius.
Hold on just a second,
though. Although acrylamide
is more likely to occur in these
foods, it has also been shown
that meat tends to harbour
other more dangerous com-
pounds. These generally fall
into two classes: PAHs (poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)
and HCAs (heterocyclic
amines). Studies have shown
there could indeed be a link
between frying or barbecu-
ing meat and a higher risk of
cancer, because these cook-
ing techniques increase the
formation of PAHs and HCAs.
The takeaway from the
jumble of acronyms and
acrylamide? Watch how you
cook, be it carbohydrate, fat
or protein. Turn your meat
on the grill regularly, and try
roasting or microwaving your
food more often. Of course
Does this look burnt?
O
f the many

have been
sweeping
off your
balconies and terraces,
cosmic dust particles could
have found their way in
your dust pan. Cosmic dust
grains are minute particles
measuring around 0.01
millimetres in size and are
remnants from the time our
solar system was born. They
contain traces of minerals and
analysing it can help scientists
to solve the puzzle of how
the entire solar system was
formed.
Until now, scientists
collected cosmic dust from
easier for them to separate it
from dust of less extravagant
origin.
Nearly five hundred cosmic
dust particles were retrieved,
and not only that, but they
were also found to vary in
size and structure from the
ones previously recovered
from Antarctica. The cosmic
dust collected from the cities
contained fewer feather-like
structured crystals than those
found in samples collected
from Antarctica, that accu-
mulated a million years ago.
This change, the scientists say,
is due to the slight shifts in
the orbits of the planets over
the last one million years.
Though the changes in the
orbits appear to be small,
the frozen areas around
the ice caps and deep in
oceans, as these places
hardly experience the kind
of terrestrial disturbance and
pollution cities do. However,
for the first time, Dr. Matthew
Genge from Imperial College
London, and his associate
amateur researcher Jon
Larsen from Project Stardust,
Norway, have demon-
strated that it is possible to
collect cosmic dust particles in
cities. The science duo went
through the mammoth task of
sifting nearly 300 kilograms
of debris from rooftops of
buildings in Paris, Oslo and
Berlin. Using the magnetic
properties of minerals found
in the cosmic dust made it

act: We contains
more DNA that
makes viruses than
DNA that makes
humans.
No, this isn’t
talking about Mr Smith’s
famous quote about how
humans are more like viruses
than mammals. 5-8% of all
human DNA contains genes
that make virus proteins,
while only ~1.5% of human
DNA contains genes that
make human proteins.
This is because viruses like
HIV (called retroviruses)
shoe-horn their DNA into
ours while infecting us. How-
ever, sometimes this DNA
‘forgets’ how to leave the
genome, and so gets stuck in
amongst our DNA.
Occasionally, this will
happen in a sperm or an
egg, and even more occa-
sionally that sperm or egg
will be fertilized and make
a whole new human. That
child will therefore have
that virus DNA in every
single cell in their body.
Crucially, they will have it
in their sperm or eggs, and
so if they have kids they will
definitely pass it on.
Ancient viruses have done
this millions of times, and
so many of them are still
kicking around that we are
at least 5 times more a virus
than we are a human. Luck-
ily, they are all stuck where
they are, so the chances
of you dying of some
million-year-old plague or
something are pretty slim.

they cause disturbances
in the gravitational forces
exerted by the planets. This
in turn changes the trajectory
and the speed at which the
cosmic dust particles whizz
through space. As cosmic
particles enter the earth’s
atmosphere, they get heated
up and changes occur in their
shape and size. This helps
in calculating the speed at
which the cosmic dust parti-
cles travel. Genge and Larsen
believe the cosmic particles
they collected from the cities
travelled at a speed of 12
km/s, making them the fastest
particles on Earth.
