Ongoing investigation into Acton stabbing
College offers support to any students feeling affected

T
he Metropolitan
police are still
searching for a
minicab driver they
believe played a
role in the fatal
stabbing of 18-year-old Khalid
Safi on December 1st
– which
occurred near Woodward
Buildings, one of Imperial
College’s residence halls.
Safi, who was living in
Southwark, was stabbed in
the heart following a fight
between two men at 6:30
last Thursday, the Evening
Standard reported.
Detective Chief Inspector
Sam Price, who is leading the
investigation, said there were
a lot of people in the area
when the stabbing occurred.
“Whilst we have spoken with
the woman we had previously
appealed for, I believe that not
everyone has come forward
at this time,” he said.
Several international
students told the Evening
Standard they were scared
but that police were giving
them limited information.
Dr. Julia Hillier, Imperial
College’s Director of Student
Tutoring, emailed students
following the attack.
“I know that many of you are
living in Woodward Halls, and
this incident may be a shock,”
she wrote. “I encourage you
to contact your tutor or one of
the senior tutors if you need
support at this time.”
According to the email, a
support meeting for students
took place Monday at 4pm in
Study Room 1 of Woodward
Halls.
Woodward Halls is the
newest residence hall,
standing 19 stories high and
housing 690 beds. Prices
range from £98-145 per
week.
Several people tweeted
about the incident, including
@hostileholly5w: “Another
aspiring rapper dies on
Londons crime filled, third
world streets...”
Others called on minicab
licensers and politicians to
solve the crisis, including @

T
he union was quite
literally painted
blue last week after
another successful
ACC. The makeover
was a result of blue
face and body paint runoff
which was part of the costumes
men’s rugby had selected for
the occasion.
The rugby players, who
attended as ‘Smelves’ (the
hybrid of a smurf and an
elf, which roughly translates
into half naked blue men)
left a trail of blue paint in
several union spaces (and
on several people) with one
College source describing
the mess left in the restrooms
resembling “a battlefield only
everyone was bleeding blue”.
The mess didn’t go unno-
ticed by Union officials.
As Rachel Blythe, Deputy
Finance and Services, told
felix, “we are aware that sev-
eral groups of students were
dressed up for the ACC event
last night [sic], some of whom
were wearing face and body
paint. After the night ended,
there was paint left in the
sinks and on some of the tiling
in the East Wing male toilets.”
Following the night’s cele-
brations, men’s rugby offered
to help clean up according to
Blythe.
“The group of students
responsible volunteered the
following day to clean up the
space without complaint. By
the afternoon the toilets were
clear.
Overall, the ACC night was
very successful, the Union
having taken steps to reduce
door and bar queuing times.”
Perhaps the ACC night was
a bit too successful though, as
it saw a Union staff member
floored after a collision with a
drunk student.
“I’m not sure if it was on
purpose or an accident. I pro-
tected my camera and phone
but got up quite quickly while
the drunk guy was still on the
floor”
We approached Dan
Green, Union Bar manager
for comment.
“When they were leaving
their shift, one member of
staff noted that they were
inadvertently knocked over
earlier in the evening by a
guest, but there was no indi-
cation that this was malicious
or intended, so no further
action was needed at that
point.”

Crying epidemic hits Imperial
Students break down as term nears to an end
Lef Apostolakis
I
mperial students
have finally cracked
under the pressure
of university life, if
the South Kensington
mass crying events
that have been popping up
on facebook are anything
to go by.
As of yet, over 4,000
students have exhibited
interest in attending at
least one of the three
mass sob sessions that are
scheduled to be taking
place next week in various
campus location across
London.
The first event, which
will be taking place on
December 12th
at UCL’s
Main Quad, might see over
2,500 students attend. The
event organised by Peter
Agorioge and Zahra Ahmed
laments “the approaching
winter holidays [being]
overshadowed by January
exams and/or deadlines,
second term and just life
in general. It’s time to start
procrastinating, stress-
eating and crying.”
A similar event will be
taking place at Queen’s
Lawn in solidarity with our
UCL brethren on the 14th
of
December.
According to organisers
Paul Balaji and Kelvin
Idialu-Ikato, “2016 has
been one of those years.
We are now undergoing a
red, white and blue Brexit,
Apple have decided to
kill the Headphone Jack,
and we’re gonna have
an Oompa Loompa in the
Whitehouse.
To top it all off, our dear
friend Harambe is also no
longer with us.
The world is weeping,
and we should too.”
Of course if there’s one
thing Imperial students are
renowned for not doing,
that’s wasting time when
they could be working.
So in recognition of the
complete lack of any social
life during these festive yet
hard times, a week long
crying marathon has been
Keep your hands off our mascots
Council votes against declaring all mascots inviolate Lef Apostolakis
organised by Charlotte
Pickering, and will be
taking place in the Central
Library throughout next
week.
As the budding
mathematician says, this
is an event “for those of
us who can’t take time off
from studying to cry, so
have to multi-task.”
So if you’re still on
Campus next week, maybe
pack some Kleenex.
A
controversial
paper was
p r e s e n t e d
at Union
Council last
Wednesday
which suggested the
creation of a Masctotry
Policy that would protect
the student body from
violence that occasionally
manifests itself during
mascot stealing raids.
The paper presented by
Council Ordinary Member
(Undergraduate Faculty
of Engineering), Andrew
Olson, and seconded by
Lloyd James, RCSU Pres-
ident, argued that many
Constituent Unions are
guilty of ‘irresponsible
mascotry’, which often
descends into physical
violence, and puts Imperi-
al’s historically invaluable
mascots in danger.
Some of the more
stealable mascots include
Bolt (a 68lb wheel nut), its
sibling Spanner (a 64lb
brass spanner manufac-
tured to perfectly fit the
bolts on London Bridge),
Davy (a three-foot high,
132lb (60kg) brass and
aluminium mining lamp)
and Theta (a seven-foot
long steel thermometer –
imagine sticking that up
your butt). Yes, Imperial is
a fun place.
If you weren’t aware of
them you’re probably not
alone, as the mascots are
rarely wheeled out due to
fear of inter-constituent
union theft.
The presentation stirred
a lively discussion, with
many Council Members
protesting the ban on
the year-long tradition of
mascot stealing.
Constituent Union mem-
bers found responsible
for allowing their mascot
to be stolen would in
the past be penalised by
downing a yard or writing
an apology article in felix
(which we would like to
point out is not a right but
a privilege). But Olson
argued that “these tradi-
tions that do not represent
the current image and
student body of the Con-
stituent Unions of Imperial
College.”
At one point he sug-
gested that in the future,
an appropriate measure
for stealing a mascot
would be calling the
police, but his proposal
was met with outrage by
several of the attendees.
In the end, although
Council agreed on the
value of Mascotry to Impe-
rial’s culture and the need
for appropriate conduct
during any events where
mascots are revealed to
the eager public (because
who doesn’t love a
seven-foot long rectal
thermometer?), declaring
all mascots inviolate was
not passed and Olson
apologised for wasting the
Council’s time.
