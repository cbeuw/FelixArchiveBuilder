his is a very special editorial, a very special
issue even. Partly because I started writing
it after smacking my head on the cold, hard
asphalt just past Kensington Gardens (I
know it looks cool to have your flowy hair
trailing behind you as you cycle, but don’t
do it kids. Don’t cycle without a helmet like this idiot).
But more importantly because it’s our first proper
THICK issue, a good 48 pages long. Now I will be
the first one to confess that my minor concussion may
be partly why I decided to push for 48 pages rather
than keep it to a comfortable 40, but the fact remains
that this is the longest issue I have personally been
responsible for putting together. I’m also completely
aware of the fact that you have absolutely no interest
in this but I also have a minor concussion which is why
I will pat myself on the back thank you very much.
Now, as you might have noticed, I started writing this
while waiting to be seen at A&E. I honestly really wish I
had finished it then because, in the words of the doctor
that flashed a flashlight in my pupils and asked me to
follow his finger as he waved in front of my confused
face “Everything will hurt a lot more tomorrow”. And
you know what kid? It’s almost like he could see the
future. Long story short it hurts. A lot. Ouch.
Yet here we are once again, persevering for your
entertainment.
This week we are running an issue on intersectionality.
Because we love pushing our mental capacity to
its limits, championing causes, trying to think of
appropriate #content that will push the agenda
without offending too many people.
Joking aside intersectionality is an important issue to
address. Imperial is so very diverse. In this tiny bubble
people of all religions, class, sexuality, genders, ages,
and ability converge. It’s easy to look at all these
elements individually and try tackling oppression on
a case to case basis. However it’s only through the
realisation that all oppression is linked, – sexism,
classism, homophobia, they’re the same – that we can
effectively tackle it.
Having said that, next term we’ll definitely be taking
a break. I cannot keep this up you guys. So get ready
for the potato issue, the watching paint dry issue and
the CBA issue. They will be great.
Until then enjoy. If the quality of the paper makes
you want to cry save it for next week’s sob-fest at
Queen’s Lawn.
And remember, always wear a helmet. Even when
you’re just walking. Even in bed. Always.
