ack in November,
when the trailer for
Chi-Raq dropped,
the reaction was
swift and brutal.
A modern-day
adaptation of Aristophanes’
comedy Lysistrata, Spike
Lee’s latest film uses rhyming
verse and bawdy humour to
debate the ongoing homicide
crisis in Chicago, Illinois – a
city with a murder rate that
identifiable colour, and they
spend much of the film hang-
ing around the downtown
streets, angling for street
cred and committing drive-by
shootings.
It’s such a shooting which
accidently kills a little girl,
that sets the spark of resist-
ance in Lysistrata. Bringing
together her female friends,
she makes peace with the
Trojan women, and they all
agree to withhold sex from
their gangster partners. “No
peace,” they cry, “no pussy”.
The movement quickly catches
on: first the women of Chi-
cago, then the United States,
and then the women of the
world don chastity belts and
take a vow of celibacy. The
action is frequently marked
with set-pieces, such as the
women taking control of a
national armoury by seducing
a Confederate-flag-loving
racist general, or the absolute
howler of a scene where the
army try and get the women
in the mood by blasting out
slow jams by The Chi-Lites.
The mood, however, is
importantly – organise.
The script, by Lee and
Kevin Willmott, is stellar,
somehow managing to veer
from rip-roaringly funny to
achingly tragic in the space
of a few stanzas, and retain-
ing rhyming verse for the
majority of the film. They may,
perhaps, let things run away
a little bit sometimes – there
are a number of subplots
that don’t really need to be
there, and the whole thing
could probably benefit from
being 20 minutes shorter
– but overall the film feels
both joltingly contemporary
and true to the original. The
classical choruses of old men
and women are replaced by
the Knights of Euphrates and
a group of female elders,
respectively, with the women
led by Angela Bassett. Lee
retains the stichomythia (the
short punchy alternating
lines) of the original, and the
parabasis (the address to the
audience) is given by Samuel
L. Jackson, who is clearly
having a ball chewing on
these delicious lines.
After the early furore that
surrounded its announcement,
Chi-Raq goes far beyond
what we might expect, deliv-
ering a film that manages to
shed a light on the unsettling
undercarriage of American
racism whilst also remaining
hugely entertaining – no
mean feat. For all intents and
purposes, it signals a return
to form for Lee, combining
the daring vernacular aspects
of Do the Right Thing with
the sweeping epic feel of
Malcolm X. With one foot in
the past, and the other firmly
in the present, Chi-Raq is a
tour-de-force of bleak humour
and righteous fury.

Chi-Raq marks a return to form
for Spike Lee, and its breathless
anger is urgently needed in these
troubled times.

never wholly light: Lee
ensures that the script goes
deep into the issues that
currently pervade the US,
forcing viewers to confront
the continuing legacy of
slavery and white supremacy.
Rising incarceration rates,
private prisons, gentrifica-
tion – nothing escapes the
glare of Lee’s cool fury. The
script name-checks not only
those who have been killed
by police over the last several
years, but also more recent
developments, like the Black
Lives Matter movement and
targeted killings: “That evil
young Klansman / Dylann
Storm Roof? / He’s the proof.
/ Post-racial... poof” – in four
lines Lee destroys the myth
of a ‘post-racial’ America
that was supposed to have
heralded in the inauguration
of Obama. Lee doesn’t let
anyone get off lightly: while
the oppressive circumstances
that drove many of the young
men to crime in the film are
explored, the gang mem-
bers are also made to take
responsibility, both for their
own actions and the gradual
degradation of gangs’ moral
code over the last 30 years.
But the film is not exclusively
set on the mean streets of
Chicago: they are vilified and
celebrated in equal measure,
with each shooting offset by
a view of a beautiful street
mural, but Lee also focusses
on the interior lives of his
characters – both metaphor-
ically and literally. A large

The sound
and the
fury of
Spike Lee
is higher than NYC and LA
combined. Chicago trauma
physician Amy Ho wrote in
The Chicago Tribune that Lee
‘has managed to trivialize the
suffering of the men, women,
and children of Chicago’s
West and South sides’, and
many were quick to agree.
Combined with the fact that
‘A Spike Lee Joint’ doesn’t
promise radical politics in
quite the same way it did in
the 1980s and 90s, Chi-Raq is
a pretty tough sell.
What a joy it is, then, to see
a film that delivers both quick
humour and biting satire,
whilst also marking a return
to form for Lee. Chi-Raq is
an urgent film, desperate-
ly-needed in today’s troubled
time of mass incarceration
and police brutality. Teyonah
Parris, perhaps best known
for her role of Dawn in
Mad Men, plays Lysistrata,
girlfriend to Demetrius ‘Chi-
raq’ Dupree (Nick Cannon),
who is leader of a local gang
called the Spartans. In a
Bloods/Crips-style feud, they
are at war with the Trojans,
whose leader ‘Cyclops’ is
played by Wesley Snipes.

proportion of scenes take
place within central hubs of
the African-American commu-
nity: gospel churches, barber
shops, reading groups. They
are shown to be the beating
heart of the African-Amer-
ican community, places
where individuals can meet,
debate, and – perhaps most
I
n the world’s current
situation, a film that can
make you laugh, cry, and
leave with a warm, fuzzy
feeling is desperately
needed. The newest
Disney princess film, Moana,
is the answer.
The storyline follows Moana
Waialiki (Auli’i Cravalho),
daughter of Chief Tui
(Temuera Morrison). Growing
up on a South-Pacific Island,
she is forbidden to ever ven-
ture further than beyond the
confines of the reef. However,
when her homeland begins to
wilt and die, she must accept
the ocean as a new comrade
(yes, they really made the
ocean a cutesy sidekick), set
out to find demi-god Maui
(Dwayne Johnson), and save
the world. Along the way,
they encounter dangers rang-
ing from entirely ridiculous
little coconut/pirate/demon
things, through to a mildly
terrifying shiny crab and the
misunderstood (but no less
dangerous) lava monster.
Although the storyline seems
a little bizarre, it is based
on genuine legends from
several South-Pacific Islands,
providing a marvelous oppor-
tunity to revel in the stories of
sun-drenched beaches, and
escape the drizzly realities of
2016.
One of the most notable
alterations to the usual Disney
Princess offerings is the total
lack of romantic storyline –
this is wonderfully refreshing.
The heart of the film instead
comes from the relationships
between Moana and those
around her. The storyline
with her parents delicately
walks the line between loving
her family and following her
own path – she does this,
surprisingly, without a single
utterance of “YOU DON’T
UNDERSTAND ME”. Her
grandmother, played by
Rachel House, gives wonder-
fully eccentric relief, being the
don’t-give-a-damn OAP that I
think we all aspire to be. The
relationship between Maui
and Moana stays platonically
teacher-student, with a sweet
development and a high level
of personal growth. Although
the trope of ‘arrogant, mus-
cled lead learning to open up
and care for others’ is a bit
old, the moments of vulnera-
bility are touching, and the
interaction with another cute
sidekick in the form of a mini
tattoo version of himself make
it less stale.
Another notable difference
is the soundtrack: in a move
away from traditional Disney
films, the songs are not stand-
alone belters, but instead
there is more of a feeling of
a real musical, with melodies
introduced in the beginning
weaving throughout – with
the exception of the horribly
creepy crab song. The pres-
ence of Lin-Manuel Miranda
(of Hamilton fame) is heavily
felt, and all for the better.
The stunning backdrop
as they sail across the
oceans, combined with the
heart-warming storyline
and enjoyable music, means
a successful evolution for
Disney princesses. The
music, message, and lead
princess’ body proportions
(she actually looks human)
are very welcome changes. If
you want a serious highbrow
movie, then this isn’t your film,
but if you want a warm hug
of a film with a few tears,
messages of self-love, and
acknowledgement it’s okay
to get fired up every so often,
then you will love this film as
much as I did .

S
ometimes a perfect
opportunity can just
present itself to a
director. Citizenfour
is a film whose
mere existence
is incredible. Based on the
drama of Edward Snowden’s
whistleblowing on the mass
surveillance being performed
by the NSA in America,
Citizenfour is the final film
in director Laura Poitras’
America After 9/11 trilogy.
What makes it so unique is
the privileged access that
Poitras had to Snowden
(codename: Citizenfour) as
he decided to pull the trigger
on his leak. Poitras and
journalist Glenn Greenwald
are the two people Snowden
personally reached out to
via encrypted emails to help
him get his message out,
awarding us a much more
personal look at Snowden
as a person. Speaking as
someone relatively ignorant
to the entire situation, I
found his portrayal deeply
humanising: Snowden comes
off as a deeply humble,
intelligent, and responsible
man. We leave the film with
an understanding of his
character and his values
which would be unachievable
through any interview or
other piece of media.
It is in this personable
aspect that the film finds its
biggest strengths. Poitras was
not afraid to take the time out
at various points to focus on
little things such as Snowden
hurriedly flicking through his
laptop or nervously doing his
hair. Time is also set apart
to allow Snowden to set out
his views and philosophies
in a series of spontaneous
interviews in his hotel room,
allowing him to outline why
this documentary is so impor-
tant. The film is also not afraid
to raise a number of its own
questions, mostly through
select clips from debates and
lectures, from the balance
of privacy vs. security to the
meaning of sovereignty
From a technical standpoint
Citizenfour is near perfect. It
hits all the marks that a good
documentary should: it’s
thought provoking, relevant,
and attention holding, with
a perfect balance between
tension-building slower
moments and a steady driving
pace. Only in Citizenfour
could a hotel’s routine fire
alarm test get my heart nearly
pounding out of my chest. The
massive depth of research is
wonderfully presented in a
way which gets across a lot
of information without being
overwhelming. Citizenfour
definitely displays a great
deal of intelligence, as well as
the journalistic passion which
shines through with Poitras
and Greenwald.
