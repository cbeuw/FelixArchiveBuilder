The Looming
Climate Crisis,
COP 21, and the
Will to Survive
Jawaad Farooq looks to the future of
combatting climate change.
T
his week a
positive 20°C
air temperature
anomaly has been
recorded over the
Arctic Ocean. With
sea temperatures averaging
around 4°C higher than
is usual for October and
November, it looks like we are
set to see more extreme effects
of climate change in the near
future.
With these alarming indi-
cators and the Paris climate
change deal where 200 na-
tions reached an agreement
to limit global warming to
2°C, you would assume the
world is moving in the general
direction of taking this threat
seriously and putting more re-
sources at the disposal of the
agencies that are equipped to
deal with this.
With Trump’s decision to
strip NASA’s earth science di-
vision of its funding, however,
we are seeing the first signs of
his anti-climate change stance
coming into play. Following
on from his other tentative
reversals, he has conceded
that there may be some ‘link-
age’ between climate change
and human activity. That is
a big jump from it being a
Chinese conspiracy against
American businesses, but his
actions are more important
than words here. The focus ap-
parently should be on ‘deep
space research’ according to
Bob Walker, a senior Trump
advisor. While deep space
may provide a distraction to
the general populations from
woes closer to home, a focus
on the earth and its functions is
essentially important if we are
to manage our impact on the
planet.
The USA has been the world’s
policeman for some time, and
a word from the US is taken
seriously; however, Trump’s
actions may signal a shift from
leading the fight against cli-
mate change towards a more
apathetic stance. This is not
what the world needs. The US
along with Chinese cooper-
ation made the Paris climate
talks a success. The $100bn
climate fund the UN promised
to make available to poorer
countries to spend in combat-
ing climate change is a vital
asset. Only 8% of this pledge
has been funded, however,
with the US contributing only
$500m of its $3bn pledge so
far and there is worry that fur-
ther funds will not materialise
under a Trump government.
The idea of political will is im-
portant. For the Paris climate
talks each country submitted
a plan called a Nationally De-
termined Contribution (NDC)
which outlined the part their
country would play in miti-
gating climate change; how-
ever, the global sum total of
these contributions far over-
reached past the 2°C thresh-
old that was agreed. Each
country must therefore submit
a more ambitious plan every
five years. For these plans to
be followed through, political
will is necessary. When there
is momentum, people are will-
ing to join the cause. When it
dies down, countries may not
feel the need to devote time to
something others do not care
much about. A joint statement
was released by 47 countries
most vulnerable to climate
change stating that by 2050
they would attempt to get all
their energy from renewable
resources. Some may specu-
late at whether this is realis-
tic, but what it does represent
is the political will. A pull out
from the cause of a major
country like the US could po-
tentially damage the will to
deliver.
Although, maybe we don’t
need to worry as much. There
are obviously those who think
that the best kind of restrictions
on fossil fuel burning are free
market forces. When cheaper
alternatives are found natu-
rally, they will supersede fos-
sil fuels as the fuel of choice.
Economic barriers stick while
government rules and carbon
taxes are an inefficient way
of enforcing limits on carbon
emissions. With that said it is
necessary for us to limit the
emissions to below 2°C warm-
ing in any way possible. Reo-
pening coal mines, as Trump
has suggested, does not make
sense economically as cleaner
alternatives become cheaper.
In 2015, emissions were down
12% from what they were in
the previous decade, and this
has been attributed to the in-
creasing use of shale gas over
coal.
At the same time renewable
technologies are becoming
cheaper and more accessible.
The cost of batteries is one-fifth
of what they were in 2008,
while efficiency has quadru-
pled. And with China looking
to become a powerhouse in
producing renewable technol-
ogies, the possibility of China
leading the way is potentially
a real one. It has its own rea-
sons as well. Pollution in major
Chinese cities is a pandemic
causing around 1.6m people
to die each year.
One writer in the Guardian
had a more pessimistic tone.
Not only is the economic
model of the world outdated
with blue collar jobs heading
towards automation, but our
frame of mind to deal with
this problem is outmoded and
thus disaster is a certainty. We
should all prepare for war.
My thoughts are ambiguous:
countries across the world are
waking up to the understand-
ing that things need to change
because for the most part it is
a matter of their own survival.
The argument really is wheth-
er we are working fast enough
and right now, we are not.
Once certain climate tipping
points are reached, there is no
going back.
Trump’s climate policies cer-
tainly take us backwards, but
the rest of the world will not
simply give up on the idea of
limiting climate change. Until
then, however, a lack of gla-
cial water feeding into dams is
causing drought in Bolivia and
Arctic ice continues to melt
away. We must not let our will
for change melt away as well.

Fake news: you
won’t believe
what I think!
Steve Bohnel is opinionated about fake
news
I
f you’ve read my comment
pieces in this paper
around the time of the
American election, then
you know two facts: first,
I’m American, and second,
I’m pretty opinionated about
our political landscape and
how polarized it’s seemingly
become.
Now, during recent weeks,
more articles have been writ-
ten about the rise of one of
the main areas that may have
drastically helped Trump win
the presidency: fake news.
While there is a political con-
nection, I’m here to argue
that, while it has become
more inflated during the past
year, this phenomenon has
been a problem in the past.
For instance, Alex Jones,
the host of his own radio
show and a founder of the
website Infowars, spends a
lot of time presenting ‘fake
news’ to the general public.
Jones has more than a mil-
lion likes on his Facebook
page and over 490,000 Twit-
ter followers, so it seems he
has a decent following. Of
all the craziness that this man
comes out with, nothing may
be worse than his belief that
the Sandy Hook shooting –
where 20 schoolchildren and
six staff members were shot
at a Connecticut elementary
school – was a hoax, staged
with actors. It’s disturbing
and insensitive to those im-
pacted by the shooting. And
it’s downright scary that peo-
ple believe what Jones is say-
ing.
To explain to you how dan-
gerous this mindset is, I’ve
had an extensive reporting
background, writing more
than 200 articles for my
school paper back home,
along with interning for Phil-
adelphia’s two major papers
for nearly seven months. As
a journalist, I will confirm
that mistakes are made –
and when they happen, I’ve
felt pretty crappy. But it’s one
thing to make a mistake. It’s
another to intentionally mis-
lead the public by reporting
without any conclusive facts
or evidence.
We’re not rocket scientists.
But reporters have the great
privilege of being granted
access to interviews with
prominent public figures,
along with the excuse to
knock on random doors on
the street to try to uncover a
story. ‘Fake news’ is not only
a disservice to the public, it
also damages the credibility
that honest reporters strive
for on a daily basis. On the
other end of this issue, we as
consumers must be mindful of
what we are seeing on social
media, and whether it is cred-
ible or not. As a reporter, this
admittedly comes as second
nature, but even I have been
duped from time to time be-
cause of how credible an
article may appear. And un-
fortunately, kids my age do
have a tough time decipher-
ing what is credible and what
isn’t.
A couple of weeks ago, NPR
reported on a study complet-
ed by researchers at Stan-
ford University investigating
whether middle school, high
school and college students
could identify different fac-
tors differentiating fake news
reports from real ones. The
researchers were “shocked”
at the results, one of which
showed that more than 30%
of high schoolers thought a
fake Fox News Twitter ac-
count was more credible
than the real one carrying
the blue verified tick next to
its name.
It should be noted that this
was only one study at one
university. But if those results
are reflected in even a minor
way across the United States
and other first world coun-
tries, that’s scary. What’s
perhaps most troubling about
this rise of ‘fake news’ is why
audiences are seemingly de-
manding it. Is it because they
like what they are reading?
Does it reaffirm their beliefs?
If so, when did basic journal-
istic principles like checking
sources, reporting facts, and
trying to be as objective and
balanced as possible stop
mattering to the general pub-
lic?
As cynical as I am, I do
believe there are enough in-
telligent people out there to
realise when they are read-
ing an illegitimate source.
The problem is that some of
these fake articles are really
deceptive. For example, na-
tive advertising appears like
a general article at first, un-
til the end when you realise
what you’ve been reading is
focused around a specific TV
show, product, or service.
Perhaps more important-
ly, I do not think ‘fake news’
swayed our election, as some
people say. Trump got a con-
siderable amount of free air-
time, and as I said before,
some voters just hated Clin-
ton so much they decided
Trump – as irrational as it
seems – was the lesser of two
evils.
‘Fake news’ does deceive,
though, and news sites like
Breitbart and Infowars are
extremely dangerous when it
comes to the freedom of the
press of my country. Our first
amendment is a great privi-
lege in my society, and seri-
ous journalists don’t take that
responsibility lightly.
And yes, while the sites I
listed are both right-wing,
I will admit the media does
lean left. That being said, we
don’t have the nerve to sug-
gest that the shooting of 20
schoolchildren was staged.
That part of this issue is some-
thing I will maybe never com-
prehend.
