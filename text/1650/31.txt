B
oth the IC women’s
first and second
teams have got
off to good starts
in their respective
BUCS and LUSL
leagues.
The first team’s opening
game was away to London
Metropolitan. A comfortable
game saw Imperial come
away with an outstanding
9-0 victory, with goals from
Jess, Rhian, Charlotte K and
Hayley. A mixture of old and
new faces coming together to
produce a dominant display.
The next fixture was away
to Kingston in the cup,
who sit two leagues above
Imperial. So when it was all
square at 0-0, IC were quietly
optimistic. It was a hard
fought second half with great

Y
ou wouldn’t
have expected
a two hour
coach journey
to Southampton
to be fun. But
when you’re surrounded by
your friends, the revision
you haven’t started yet
fades into memory. Fuelled
by Oreos and cranberry
juice, the valiant team
arrived at the glorious hotel.
Dinosaur onesies? Check.
Full body blue paint? Check.
Dishclothes? ... Damn.
Whilst searching for food
and beverages, the team
were distraught to discover
Sainsburys closed. Solution?
Kebab shops and ‘offies’.
With sustenance secured, it
was time to allocate ‘tasks’:
some secret, most Jurassic
Park themed. Some were glo-
riously executed with many
Velociraptor poses taken,
kinder-eggs eaten, and one
start-up ... started. Others
failed miserably, with mask-
ing-tape eggs hidden at the
bottom of sleeping bags and
the phrase “Skene’s gland”
uttered once too many.
Tasks allocated, we arrived
at Oceana and danced the
night away on the famous
rainbow- lit dancefloor whilst
almost gaining access to
‘special rooms’ before leaving
in search of pizza. The next
day the team were ener-
gised for the match against
Southampton, with the fitness
officer shouting constant
encouragement. It was a
game of breakout runs from
all, forward Laura plowing
through the defence like a
plastic tub melting through
a grill and Joe making some
spectacular runs to secure
a hatfull of tries. 12-19 at
halftime, however after a
great combination of scrums
and runs, Southampton’s last
minute try before the end of
the game was superfluous to
secure victory. However they
did join us in a spectacular
Velociraptor moment.
While the rugby game was
lost, the costume game was
won, as rugby prepared for
a Jurassic Park themed night
at Jesters. With an increase
in Southampton buddies to
party with, it was a magical
night of green and red
drinks, fire code violations
and double-toilet cubicles.
Returning home once again
to the joy that is pizza, it was
a wonderful end to the 20
hour long day. Exhausted but
proud of all we’d accom-
plished, rugby indulged in
the customary IKEA Sunday
breakfast, with a few players
venturing into the children’s
sections to buy a stuffed tiger
performances across the pitch
and looked to be going to
extra time until a Kingston
striker scored a soul crushing
goal, finishing 1-0.
The first team went back
to their winning ways in the
next two games with a 2-0
victory against UCL 3s (two
from golden girl Lorraine)
and a 17-1 thrashing of King’s
College. The highlight of this
match saw Anna breaking
through from centre half to
score two very good individ-
ual goals.
The second team have
had a very similar start. The
first match was a solid 6-1
victory over SOAS. Goals
from Jess, Sorenza, Camille
and Megan. Their second
game was a thrilling away
fixture against the veterinary
college. A couple of last
minute drop-outs meant that
Imperial were down to ten
players and it was going to
be a tough game. But by
taking the few chances they
were given IC went into the
break 3-0 up. Pressure from
the eleven players of royal
veterinary college eventually
paid off and they drew level
part way through the second
half. Goals were exchanged
between the two sides until it
was 5-4 to Imperial with ten
minutes remaining. Imperial
almost had it wrapped up but
gave away a penalty in the
last few seconds of the game.
Fortunately the veterinary
player hit it over the bar and
Imperial were well deserved
winners after a tremendous
effort from all. The match ball
when to hat-trick hero Jess,
with the remaining goals sup-
plied by Rachel and Camille.
The 2s team did slightly
better in the cup than the 1s,
winning their first round game
18-0 but unfortunately going
out in the second round with
a loss to UCL 1s (we only had
ten players!).
