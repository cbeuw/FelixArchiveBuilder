2015 bursary scheme criticised at Council
Union to request reimbursement of unfairly underfunded students
Lef Apostolakis
U
nion Council
voted to put
pressure on
College to
i n v e s t i g a t e
the legitimacy
of the 2015-2016 bursary
scheme which has been
criticised for not providing
adequate funding to
students of higher income
brackets.
The decision was made
based on findings presented
by second year physicist
Rhidian Thomas.
Currently, financial
support is awarded annually
to Home undergraduate
students with a household
income of up to £60,000.
The sum awarded depends
on the income bracket,
and varies depending on
which bursary scheme the
individual is on.
Depending on the year
of enrolment at Imperial,
students are put on
different bursary schemes.
Over the last three years,
bursary changes between
different schemes have
been negative, with no
extra funds being provided
to any income bracket, and
higher income brackets
(from £35k to £60k) seeing
a sharp drop in funding.
Rhidian looked and the
total amount of funding
received by students from
each income bracket
eligible for the IC bursary
(loans and grants from
SLC, as well as IC bursary)
and also estimated the
total annual living costs at
Imperial (at £11,522).
for the bursary would be
receiving substantially
(£2-4k) less than the living
costs.
The discrepancy between
the funding received by
lower versus higher income
bracket students is limited to
2015 as the following year,
Imperial College changed
the bursary scheme yet
again increasing the
bursaries of higher income
bracket students and
decreasing those of lower
income bracket students.
One student in the
audience pointed out that
while currently, due to him
receiving funding under the
2015 bursary scheme, he
only received a few hundred
pounds worth of financial
support, his bursary
would have amounted to
a few thousands if he had
enrolled in 2016 instead of
2015.
Rhidian believes that
there are roughly 200-
400 students at imperial
who are receiving an
inadequate bursary solely
as a result of their year of
enrolment.
The paper was put to
a vote and passed. The
union agreed to the need
to support these students,
as while they’re on the
higher end of students
eligible for bursary,
their households are not
necessarily particularly
well off. A household
income of £50,000
corresponds to two workers
each earning less than the
average Imperial graduate
starting salary. Currently
these students are victims
“of a system College
themselves acknowledge is
inadequate.”
In the future we should
expect a thorough
investigation into the
numbersofstudentsaffected
by this issue. The Union
will work in conjunction
with and lobby College to
make sure existing students
are not overlooked. A
request will be made for
additional funds to be
made available for students
in the “squeezed middle”
£35,000 - £60,000 income
brackets who are currently
on the 2015-intake bursary
scheme – both to reimburse
them for the 2016-17
academic year, and to
guarantee this funding
for the remainder of their
degrees.
