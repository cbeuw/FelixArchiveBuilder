KEEPING OCCUPIED
I must admit to being absolutely delighted
when the decision was taken to occupy part
of College block, not just because I thought it
was the right thing to do, but also because I
thought it would be great fun. It was a chance
to do something different, to get out of the rut
of life at IC, and also a matter of personal
pride because I was jealous of friends at other
colleges who had taken part in sit-ins.
The atmosphere on the first afternoon can
only be describe, as euphoric; it was a thrill
just to be in the S D R at that time surrounded
by so much enthusiasm and optimism. The
early hours of the morning arrived and the
place was still active - who were those two
guys playing table-tennis at 4am? Those with
foresight had grabbed sleeping bags and
camp beds (although, considering the
number of people w h o found their beds
folding up underneath them during the night,
I think I was better off on the carpet).
Next morning I awoke to the sight of bodies
strewn all over the place, J o organizing
people into clearing up and Pat playing table
tennis. Christ, I thought, my room is Beit isn't
usually like this. Then cleaners came in,
looked around in surprise, exchanged a few
comments in Italian and went away again.
The staff didn't all accept it quite so readily,
when they arrived for their lunch - we
explained the situation and only a couple
seemed put out by it.
Their was a sigh of relief from some
quarters when table tennis club reclaimed
their table on Wednesday afternoon, so Aftab
tried to get people to play bridge with him
instead; not a lot of hope, really, gambling on
three-card brag was far more popular. Life
was beginning to become organized; for a
while music was limited to five arbitrary
cassettes because Malcolm kept forgetting to
bring his S e x Pistols tape (cries of 'Thank
God!' from Ian) but he did bring in a kettle and
a hacksaw (a Hack-saw? - in case of fire, he
assured us). Eric replenished our food
supplies by going out busking and buying
with the proceeds. Mary provided a couple of
pounds of carrots - Waitrose Class J carrots
at that!
I felt sorry for two guys who came over after
seeing the E N T S film on Thursday evening;
they had to watch it for a second time, as we
had a free showing of it. It was bad enough for
them having wasted thirty pence, but they
didn't like 'Emmanuelle 2' thefirsttime. There
was always the telly to watch, if we felt really
desperate for something to do. Out of
solidarity with the ITV Unions it only picked
up B B C 1.
During the daytimes most people sat
around reading Asterix books and Beano and
there was the occasional conscientious
person writing up lab reports (Caroline). Eric
and Mick slept in the corner; a good reason
for continuing this occupation indefinitely
is that it w a s the most permanent and
comfortable place either Eric or Mick have
had to live for ages.
Nightimes were far more interesting - say
no more - although Chris insists that this is a
respectable sit-in. It is an acquired art to learn
how to get to sleep before three, when there's
more activity going on around you than in
Stan's on a Saturday night (Strip Snap'? - the
mind boggles!). It's nice (!) to wake up on a
Friday morning knowing that there are still
hundreds of F E L I C E S to be collated,
somebody (no names mentioned) was still
collating them on Friday afternoon.
At the end of my most interesting and
entertaining week at Imperial College I would
like to offer thanks to the following people:
1. The kitchen staff for providing us with the
occasional plate of sandwiches and pasties.
2. Chris for giving me the satisfaction of
thrashing him at table tennis.
3. Joe for making innumerable cups of tea
and allowing herself to be insulted.
4. Eric for the dulct tones of his guitar and
anagrams.
5. Mick for his even better anagrams-did you
know that an anagram of Charles Philip
Arthur George Windsor ( H R H Prince of
Wales) is 'Harrow Sloth Craps Huge Pile
Grinder'!
6. West London Chaplaincy for the lunch on
Sunday.
7. Archie for the music centre - a vast
improvement on a crackly cassette recorder.J
8. The majority at the U G M who gave us the
opportunity to miss lectures with a good
reason.
9. Mick also for losing to himself at table
tennis in a needle match with his other half at
1:30am on Wednesday.

Dear Sir,
I would like to raise a few
points with regard to the
amendment to the occupation
motion proposed by Sholom
Godsi. Unfortunately there
was insufficient time available
for this amendment (which
supported the government's
policy) to be discussed; some
people have described this
decision as 'undemocratic',
but I should point out that the
procedural motion that it be
not discussed was passed by a
large majority.
Most of this amendment was
concerned with arguing that
e d u c a t i o n c u t s a r e a n
economic necessity; to the
contrary, I would argue that a
high standard of education is
vital to Britain's economic
future. We are a small country
with too high a population
density to be able to provide
enough food for ourselves,
and precious few mineral
resources, except for a drop of
oil, which will run out in
twenty years. So how is it that
we retain such a high standard
of living and are still one of the
w o r l d ' s m o s t i n f l u e n t i a l
nations?
The answer is obvious; we
rely upon the high degree of
expertise s h o w n by o u r
t e c h n i c i a n s , e n g i n e e r s ,
sceintists a n d admistrators,
which is respected through-
out the world, and upon the
trust and goodwill with which
we are viewed by foreign
countries as a result of the
numbers of their people who
were educated in this country
(and thus increasing our
trade). Obviously, all of this is
based upon us maintaining a
high standard of education
which is freely available to
everyone, whether they live
and work in Britain or abroad.
Of course in the short term
cutbacks in education will
save money (or rather give
Thatcher more to spend on
'defence') and may make a
minor contribution towards
economic recovery, but it will
also cause unemployment in
the education sector, many
courses will probably have to
be closed down, and less
valuable research work will be
able to be done. Also, at the
moment many of the best
students in the world come to
Britain to do research for their
PhD; will they still be able to
do s o if the government
introduces fees based upon
the 'full economic cost' of a
course? I doubt it and we
would therefore lose students
who are potentially among the
world's best scientists.
I would therefore argue that
the present government's
education policy is the most
ridiculously short-sighted of
all time, and is purely aimed at
providing a small temporary
benefit to the economy in
order to help themselves get
re-elected in four years' time,
a n d g i v e s n o r e g a r d
whatsoever to the jeopardy in
which these policies may put
the e c o n o m y . i a twenty or
thirty years' time. Education is
a sound long-term investment
and Mrs Thatcher can't see
past the end of her nose.
