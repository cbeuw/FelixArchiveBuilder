ALBUM REVIEWS
BY CHRIS WATTS
DAVID WERNER
(EPIC)
Once upon a time, in the mid-seventies, in
the days of the dinosaur rock bands, there
lived and gigged a band called the New York
Dolls, who used to dress up in ladies clothing
and go on stage and play heavy rock. They
weren't very good.
However, there is a happy ending to this
story. David Werner was one young
gentleman that used to play in the afore-
mentioned outfit (sic), and has now produced
a solo album, which is probably the best that
I've heard since March of this year. " A h , " I
hear you say, "it's all very well extolling the
virtues of this masterpiece, but how do you
classify the music?" Well it seems that you
can't classify it, Werner appears to have
ignored all trends towards disco or punk,
neither has he grabbed onto the recent
respectability of 'pop', but produces songs
that could have been laid down on a forgotten
record by David Bowie in his 'Man who Sold
the World/Ziggy Stardust' era, an almost
uncanny example of this is 'Every New
Romance', which was mixed by lan Hunter.
The LP opens with a very fast track, 'Can't
Imagine', which is almost like a Motorhead
single in its speed, but totally superior in kthe
resolution between each distinct chord from
the lead guitar, but leaving the emphasis on
the drumming, care of Tom Monney (no
relation).
This is followed by a couple of songs that
sound as though they were at least produced
by Bowie, five or six years ago, although all
the material was written by Werner himself.
Perhaps the strongest feature of the album
is the immense variety of style, ranging from
Kinks softies to heavy metal, with an
exceptionally competent band the music
does not need to rely on one particular
player/instrument to carry the songs
through, for instance on 'Every New
Romance' the vocals and bass are all that are
recalled, whereas on 'Eye to Eye' the slicing
lead guitar is all that is remembered. Mark
Doyle plays it like he could have had tuition
from Pete Townsend.
Unfortunately for Mr Werner, I don't think
that there is a track from the record that is
very suitable to turn into asingle, and without
the air play, that asingle would bring, nobody
is going to buy the album. Better luck next
time.
DREAM POLICE
- C H E A P TRICK (EPIC)
Cheap Trick have found a successful
f o r m u l a for s e l l i n g t h e i r r e c o r d s ,
consequently this album sounds irritatingly
like their last studio album.
The band have been going for some time
now. Tom Peterson and Rick Nielson started
together in the late sixties then split the band
to play with Tom Mooney and Stewkey, the
remnants of Nazz after Todd Rundgren gave
u p o n them to go solo; then after another split
the present line-up got together in the early
seventies and have been doing the rounds in
the U S for five or six years.
Since then they have cracked all the
single/album charts necessary to make big
money, and I expect that they'll do it again
with this offering as it sounds an equally
unispired, heavy-metal rip-off as the last.
But onto the good points. The eighteen
months old promotional blurb that came with
the album held that, as far as I could translate,
the great strength of the music must be the
great inventiveness and variety of chords
coming from Tom Peterson's bass. If you
want imaginative bass playing then buy a
Status Quo record instead of this.
As for Zander's "amazing voice", it sounds
on 'Need Your Love' like Donna Summer's 'I
Need Love' single played at 33 1/3rpm and I'd
agree that "it's a just indication of what an ace
rock singer he is". (Quotes in the above
paragraph are from the promotional text).
Probably the best thing about this album is
that it is not even catchy. My copy is up for
grabs
LASER LOVE
- AFTER THE FIRE
(CBS)
Now we come to After the Fire and their first
long player, which is quite a relief after having
listened to Cheap Trick three or four times.
You've heard the singles, they came to IC last
year so most of you have had the chance to
see them live.
The album is very much like the singles in
that it is professionally played, catchy and
revolves around the keyboards. The whole
album is eminently suitable for airplay from
that great network in the sky, Radio One as it
is well played, well produced and contains
neat 'pop' tunes. However, the material from
which the songs are fabricated just does not
come up to scratch. Although producer, Muff
Winwood (who,in part, was responsible for
the phenomenal success of Dire Straits) has
made the best of mediocre material. Although
fun and bouncy, every song sounds as
though it was meant to be a single, which is
no badthing (remember'Parallel Lines'?), but
just did not come up to scratch and so got laid
down as an album track.
But apart from anything else the single
'One Rule for You' is included on the album,
which must be a bonus for the LP. If you like
keyboard music then you will probably enjoy
this record immensely, as most of the songs
revolve around the keyboard player, Peter
'Memory' Banks, who is a highly proficient
player.
