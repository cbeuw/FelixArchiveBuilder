FELIX me III cry
As you may or may not know, depending on
whether you managed to grab one of the
rationed copies of last week's FELIX, ICU has
been in occupation in the senior dining room.
This was intended to, and did illicit a
response from the outside world. Other
student unions, the college authorities,
politicians and the media have all reacted to
varying extents. It was intended to increase
awareness amongst students of this and
other colleges.
The attendance in the occupation
obviously varied from time to time, generally
it was fair, sometimes it was either good or
bad. I am heartened by the number of 'non
hacks' who care but, obviously not satisfied.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals (CVCP) upon which such people
as our own rector sits has reacted with
unprecedented swiftness and firmness
against recently published plans to charge
this legendary full economic cost to overseas
students, and to deduct the appropriate sum
from universities' budget.
Indeed the CVCP seem much more
concerned than many student unions,
perhaps indicating that the situation is not
just in the minds of anti-Tory commies. To
quote Sir Alec Merrison, Chairman of Vice-
Chancellors Committee: "....the government
proposes to remove a substantial part of our
income under the fallacious belief that it
corresponds to the 'subsidy' to overseas
students, leaving universities to recoup
whatever they can by charging so-called
'economic fees', which would have to be at a
level far in excess of anything charged to
students anywhere else in the world.
"The effect of these policies upon our
universities and their students - both from
home and overseas - is potentially disastrous.
They will undermine institutions which are
vital national assets of international renown.
Whatever the pressures to reduce public to
reduce public expenditure the government
must sustain such institutions; to do less will
cause grave damage to the country's ability to
survive in an increasingly competitive world.
My committee implores the Secretary of State
to think again."
Once again that is not some 'whining lefty'
but someone at the top of the educational
administration and not given to over-
reaction.
People have complained that they voted for
a balanced president and this action is
somehow unbalanced. In my manifesto
whilst speaking out against politics in student
unions and whilst being a non-political
person, I did say that there are educationally
politic issues and I cited overseas students
fees and grants as such issues. I hope by a
balanced president they did not want
someone who was prepared to fiddle while
Rome burned.
