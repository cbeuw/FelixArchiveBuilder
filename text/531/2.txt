Dear Sir,
ICU does it again! Any credibility
still left, must surely have floated
out of the window now with the
news that ICU is fighting the
government. How spectacular a
method. A n occupation! Sit-in in
the senior dining room. What
disruption - what chaos! The
government trem bles - surely with
such a convincing opposition, it
must fall. Yes, the government will
be brought to its knees by ICU's
occupation.
Like hell! The only lasting effect
this farce is going to have will be
to make this college the laughing
stock of the education system. If
ICU is going to protest at
anything, then for Pete's sake -
M A K E T H E M S E N S I B L E P R O -
T E S T S - ones which actually
stand a chance of working.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,
Apparently IC Radio announced
in their news bulletin last week,
that Colin Palmer had not been
proposed for the sabbatical post
of FELIX editor. O n Friday,
October 12th, at 11:00am, I signed
the nomination papers as his
proposer. I have several witnesses
to this. Roger Stotesbury has
verified that Colin had twenty
seconders (not fifteen, as stated
on IC Radio).
Yours,
Jill Dawson
Dear Sir,
Last year we voted for a balanced
union under Chris Fox. However,
the evidence of the last union
meeting suggests that we were
badly misled. At the time of the
election, Mr Fox made it quite
clear, implicitly if not explicitly,
that the union should represent
the true wishes of the majority of
students at IC.
Does Mr Fox really believe that
this majority wishes to be
associated with such a pointless
and self-indicting action, as the
occupation of the senior common
room.
While agreeing with the general
feeling of the motion, we feel that
the action proposed can only
damage the reputation of IC and
can have no useful outcome.
Yours sincerely,
D Cornwell and A Gardam

Dear Colin,
We are disgusted! We were
sitting in our flat on Saturday
night and we read about a concert
in the concert hall, so we went.
We paid two pounds each forthis
'pleasure', when we could have
gone to any number of London
pubs to hear a far better band in a
far better environment.
We respectfully suggest the
sacking of IC E N T S committee or
a maximum price of seventy-five
pence for any concert in future.
This was a rip-off!
Yours sincerely,

Dear Colin,
As a customer of the Nat West
bank in college, for many years
now, I have noticed thatifs getting
increasingly difficult to use this
facility without having to wait for
excessively long periods. Even
the introduction of the quick
service till and the mail box have
failed to improve the situation.
This is particularly noticeable on
Friday afternoons and lunch-
times, when it is exceedingly
difficult to get in the doors. I feel it
is about time the bank's premises
were extended to cope with the
increasing demand.

agreed with Mr Whitehouse's
comments.)
Dear Editor,
I am writing to you concerning
the report on the U G M , which
appeared in last week's FELIX. I
shall not comment on the general
quality of this report, but I am
however, very concerned about
the paragraph, which referred to a
heckler. The reason is, that I was
in fact, the heckler mentioned,
and I most certainly did not say or
imply what was reported. I know a
number of people did not hear all
of what I actually said, so for the
record, for those who did not hear
the full text of my statement, here
it is: "I wonder if the Irishmen who
put bombs under cars would
agree." I never used the word
racism and certainly did not
imply, that the troubles in Ireland,
give us the right to make fun of the
Irish race. The reason why I in fact
made the statement in the first
place is that, to me, racialism is
independent of the actual race in
question, so an Irish joke is also
racialist, like a joke about an
Indian or a Jew. Therefore I could
not understand why the speakers
seemed to accept the Irish jokes
and not the other racialist and sick
jokes, that appear in this year's
ICU Rag Mag. I did vote in favour
of it being banned and feel the
Editor, in the future should be
answerable to the Union Exec. As
what he produces, will help to give
a good or bad name to IC
students.
I feel for too long, the British
have aimed a large proportion of
their jokes at the Irish and if this
stopped, perhaps it could help
remove the anti-British attitude,
that occurs in some Irish people,
both inside and outside Ireland.
Then, with a bit more under-
standing between both peoples,
the tragic troubles in Northern
Ireland could be solved, much
earlier than seems likely at
present.
I apologize to anybody who
might have misunderstood the
part of my statement they heard
and been offended by it. I will, in
future, keep"my mouth shut and I
hope that FELIX reports, contain
only accurate and not misleading
sections, as this one failed to do.
Yours sincerely,
Ian Prosser

Dear Colin,
Re the letter by J C Pearson on
foreign student's fees (sorry to
labour the point, but....). Guys
with ideas like Pearsons are the
most depressing thing about IC.
Take the first paragraph, he
makes it quite clear from the start
that his first concern is himself
and that "matters of direct
concern to students" are the only
ones worth worrying about. It
seems to me that many, if not most
IC students seem to care about
little more than the size of their
grants, because this directly
affects the amount of beer they
can pour down their alimentary
canals on pub crawls and pub
nights. Most rag stunts are
glorified open air parties where
sundry idiots can pratt about to
their hearts content, and , except
for a few great guys who reason,
the students who go on the four-
legged races etc., see the raising
of money as a side issue of little
concern to them.
I cannot comment on the 'facts'
about student fees, as most
sources seem to be out to bend
them to suit their point of view.
But talking on issues only:
compare the few millions spent
on or gained from foriegn
students with the thousands of
millions spent on foreign aid, so is
overseas aid wrong?
How many people recently have
said in one sentence what a
shame it is that the people of
Zimbabwe and many other third
world countries cannot run their
own societies due to lack of
education, and in the next
denounce the supposed financing
of overseas students.
And lastly Mr Pearson say's that
this all comes out of taxpayer's
money, but I don't see too many
taxpayers dying of malnutrition or
sleeping twelve and thirteen to a
one room shack. C o m e on,
college is not an ivory tower, nor is
Britain for that matter. Third
World future is our future. Let's
see more overseas aid, more
overseas students, but most of all
more A C T I O N .

Dear Colin,
Re Mr Pearson's letter about the
student fees. I would like to point
out that there are two views
r e g a r d i n g t h i s p o i n t : t h e
g o v e r n m e n t s a n d t h a t of
U K C O S A and N U S . M r Pearson's
view is based on the government's
view of the 'full economic cost'.
The view taken • by N U S and
U K C O S A is that o v e r s e a s
s t u d e n t s s h u l d be c h a r g e d
marginal costs. This is based on
the concept that the education
system is designed for the home
students and that the overseas
element represents extra students
'on the margin' and it is logical to
use marginal rather than average
costing in the fees analysis.
According to this, overseas
students bring in £50million per
year to subsidize the British
economy.
I think it is about time the two
opposing parties got together and
decided what the full economic
implications are for housing
overseas students in Britain.
At the moment universities'
grants are going to be cut in direct
proportion to the number of
overseas students that they take
in, thus forcing universities to
charge the 'full economic cost'.
This would lead to a drastic
reduction in the number of
overseas students (and govern-
ments) who would be able to
afford these fee levels (£2,350 per
student).
Yours sincerely,
M Fernando
Dear Colin,
Having seen an approximately
4"x4" photograph of Professor
Abdus Salam, semi-pasted onto
your prototype cover last week
(two days before printing), I was
disappointed, nay disgusted to
find that only the four and a half
line article appeared on the final
print.
I sincerely believe that the great
achievement of an IC professor
being awarded the Nobel Prize for
Physics, should have been given
more coverage in what is, after all,
IC's most widely read publication.
With two pages of letters and a
large advert for IC's 'news
service', I am sure that alternative
space for the eventual bottom-
right corner article could have
been found.
Yours, until I unify the strong
nuclear force with gravity,
