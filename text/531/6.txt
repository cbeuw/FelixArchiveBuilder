Dear Colin,
Here's another letter about the
Frank James controversy (did he
really write his letter just to get a
correspondence going in the
FELIX letters column?).
I'm a fresher and like S D Goulder
in last week's FELIX, I have made
up my own mind. However, I
disagree with Frank James main
conclusions in that, while I think
that some of his criticisms are
valid, the solutions that he
suggests would not, in fact, work.
Students seem to need some way
of 'letting off steam' and how this
is done varies from one student to
another; some listen to loud
m u s i c , o t h e r s d r o w n t h e i r
academic worries in beerand play
the most trivial of childish games
until the early hours of the
morning.
Nothing can change this facet of
human nature; so it is only
reasonable that some form of
organization is present in college
t o s u p e r v i s e ( a n d e v e n
encourage) such recreational
activities, and furthermore, to
ensure that they do not get out of
hand. The C C U s fulfill this
function admirably while at the
same time coordinating academic
problems and raising a very large
amount of money for charity. I feel
that a single central organization
would not be able to do this nearly
as efficiently; because by the
nature of their purposes the C C U s
are each a 'personal' organization
to which each student can feel
that he or she 'belongs'. A large
body such as ICU is too immense
for the average fresher (et al) to
identify with.
The C C U s provide a lot of
enjoyment for their members, and
while being far from perfect (is
anyone, even Frank James?), I
believe they should be retained,
even if perhaps 'cleaned up' a
little.
Sincerely,
Jeremy Nunns ( E E 1 )
PS - Re the infamous comment: I
don't particularly like beer, and
have the usual male inclinations.
Dear Sir,
I a m i n d e e d d i s a p p o i n t e d
(though not altogether surprised)
that the U G M , last Tuesday saw fit
to reject the motion calling for the
banning of the Rag Mag. I found
its contents polluted with obscene
and sick 'jokes', and as a member
of t h e o v e r s e a s s t u d e n t
community here, I was very
o f f e n d e d a n d m o r e o v e r ,
disheartened by its racialist
overtones. Despite those cynics
who may smirk 'tough' or 'too
bad', I wholeheartedly agree with
Mr Gujral's condemnation of it.
May I also point out that Lord
F l o w e r s h a s e x p r e s s e d h i s
disapproval in this matter. In fact, I
would be amazed if other IC
students are not themselves of the
same opinion.
The arguments presented by
the motion's opponents struck me
as being contradictory, facetious
and even hypocritical. Substan-
tially they were as follows:
i. The Rag Mag is published with
the intent to raise money for
charities (a most commendable
cause which no-one can surely
begrudge) and therefore a certain
degree of licence in its contents is
to b e p e r m i t t e d ( w h i c h
p r e s u m a b l y is a s e q u a l l y
commendable).
ii. T h e magazine had already been
s o l d ( d e s p i t e s o m e l e g a l
aberrations) and to withdraw or
ban it w o u l d c a u s e s o m e
inconvenience, especially as the
money raised could be spent
profitably by the charities.
S o m e of m y s u b s e q u e n t
comments may appear to certain
factions of the student populace
to be a trifle unrealistic and
moralistic, but I feel they are
necessary to the issue.
"The hallmark of her work has
been respect for the individual
human being, for his or her dignity
and innate value."
Firstly, the above quotation is an
extract of a tribute paid by the
chairman of the Nobel award
committee to Mother Theresa, the
recipient of this year's peace
prize. It stresses the respect one
human being ought to have for
another, a respect which should
not be d i m i n i s h e d by any
affliction a person may endure.
Clearly many of the 'jokes' are
hardly respectful of a person's
race, creed, colour or situation. It
is all very well saying, "no harm
intended" or "it's only a joke,"
but such phrases only belie the
essential cruelty and insulting
behaviour inherent in these jokes.
One does not have to suffer from
paranoia to dislike being ridiculed
or laughted at. I am somewhat
mystified then, that IC students,
albeit not saints, do not share
Mother Theresea's respect for
individual dignity, and have
permitted and even condoned the
free licence granted to the
compilers (the term editors is I
feel, rather inappropriate) of the
magazine.
S e c o n d l y , p e r h a p s I a m
confused, but I am under the
impression that we students are
first and foremost human beings.
It is idiotic to suppose that people
are not offended by certain jokes
merely because they are students
and can therefore adopt such an
enlighted status and conde-
scending attitude towards this
Rag Mag.
It was also noticeable that many
people at the U G M believed that it
was too late to act after the 'horse
had bolted'. This appears to imply
that some saw the Rag Mag as
potentially obscene etc., but
nevertheless believed it was more
expedient to proceed with its
circulation. Is this then not
an irresponsible and hypocritical
attitude?
Unfortunately, it seems that the
m a t t e r h a s b e e n s e t t l e d
irrevocably and the proceeds
heading for a deserving charity. I
wonder, would it be a fair
assumption on my part to expect
the rag committee to donate a
copy of the mag to the recipient
charity as a substantive memento
of their efforts. I am sure it will be
greeted with great interest. I
would also hope that IC students
will ensure that all future Rag
Mags be subject to more stringent
editorial control to prevent the
present situation repeating itself
and causing further embarrass-
ment.
I must finally add that it is
unfortunate that in the same week
as Professor Abdus Salam of the
p h y s i c s d e p a r t m e n t w a s
honoured by a Nobel Prize, the
name and prestige of our college
will inevitably be tarnished.
Yours respectfully,
Rumar SingaRajah
