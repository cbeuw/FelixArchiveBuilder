Dear Sir,
J o n Marsden and J o n Fewtrell
might be interested to note that,
contrary to 'heir misguided
assertion in FEL.X last week, not
all who supported the occupation
motion did so as they suggested
(ie by preparing themselves to
miss lectures for as long as
deemed necessary), but that for
many it was a spontaneous
response to a most critical issue. I
l i k e m a n y o t h e r s , h a d n o
preconceived notions of the
meeting's outcome, but felt
compelled to react in this way to
the Conservative assault on our
country's educational values.
However, the brunt of my
disapproval must fall on Richard
Wormsley whose attack on Chris
F o x ' s a c t i o n c a n o n l y be
construed as vociferous support
for these intolerable government
policies. I would ask him; does
any mandate, regardless of size,
give any government, regardless
of politics, the right to wield its
legislative axe unchallenged,
even if it does so with the blind
t h r a s h i n g of t h e p r e s e n t
government. The answer is simply
a vigorous NO, for otherwise a
path would be laid conducive to
dictatorial leadership.
We have been confronted with
policies which are founded in
s o c i a l injustice rather than
economical necessity. Educa-
tional elitism has found a
resurgence initiated by sweeping
educational cuts opposed only by
a financial influx into the private
e d u c a t i o n s e c t o r . F o r e i g n
s t u d e n t s are l a m b a s t e d by
proposed massive fee increases
as Britain slams shut the door on
educational advancement on
anything other than on a purely
introspective, national level.
Those cuts threaten to erode the
British educational system whilst
juxtaposing it with one founded
on privilege. The economics of
the cuts are ridiculed by the
insidious and massive proposed
increases in defence expenditure.
If in the light of these proposals,
the students of this college still
feel indebted to apathy, then on
their own conscience is this
c o u n t r y ' s f u t u r e . O t h e r w i s e
support our Union's attempts at
mobilizing student and public
opinion. IC may yet catalyse
feelings that this government
cannot suppress and successfully
force them, by popular opinion, to
step down on the issues in
question.

Sir,
Re: The current Rag Mag.
As editor of this outstanding
entity, I was shocked, nay mildly
stunned, to witness the total
collapse of sensibilities within this
college. Some particularly nasty
individuals seem to have leapt
upon the bandwagon: "Let's ban
this sexist, racist and depraved
p u b l i c a t i o n , e s p e c i a l l y the
volkswagon joke."
Firstly, I disagree that this label
applies and secondly, I have
neither the time nor the biro ink to
spare on the subject of Rag Mag
material; after all, some of us have
excellent degrees to work for.
A subject worth far more
consideration is the intervention
of the college solicitors in
connection with the fact that our
Rag Mag did not boast the
printers' imprint.
T h e s e i n d i v i d u a l s , in their
c o n c e r n for t h e f i n a n c i a l
wellbeing of our union, saw fit to
warn our union of the possible
consequences of distributing
such an illegal document. A wise
move, I say, as they seem to think
(I have been told that they are not
absolutely certain, however) that
such an offence carries a fine of
five pounds per copy sold, both to
the publisher and the printer. I
know not whether this be true or
false; I would appreciate some
c o r r e s p o n d e n c e f r o m s a i d
college solicitors upon the matter,
as I have not had the time
(pressure of academic work) to
travel to H M S O in Holborn to
obtain the relevant printing acts
â€¢ H o w e v e r , i n m y S o u t h
Kensington based search for the
truth, I telephoned the managing-
director of Chamelion Press (the
printers of such publications as
the 'Alternative P r o s p e c t u s ' .
'Spanner' and collators of the 'IC
Union Handbook'), obviously a
very distinguished company, who
refused to print our Rag Mag and
who very nearly always put their
i m p r i n t u p o n their p r i n t e d
material. Off the top of his head,
he informed me that the fine was
twenty pounds per copy sold,
both to the printer and publisher.
He did say, however, that he was
not sure of this.
I next telephoned Private Eye
(who have contributed to the Rag
Mag) to speak to their legal
department, but he had gone
h o m e . H o w e v e r , a n o t h e r
gentleman from the Eye said that
he was pretty damn sure that you
could be imprisoned for such an
offence, but he was not that sure.
So there we have it: a five pound
fine (College), a twenty pound
fine (Chamelion) or imprisonment
(Eye).
N o w , d o y o u r e m e m b e r
'Jamrag'? This was our Rag Mag
two years ago. Imagine my
surprise when I discovered that
the printers' imprint was absent,
thus making all ten thousand
copies distributed quite illegal. If
only college solicitors had been
so efficient two years ago, the
union would have been saved a
possible prosecution resulting in
an almost .certain fine of fifty
thousand pounds or perhaps two
hundred thousand pounds or
maybe imprisonment.
I tremble at the thought that if
some particularly nasty individual
were to take this year's Rag Mag to
court (number distributed : six
hundred) then obviously the
Jamrag would have to be cited as
a major previous offence. Gosh!
How terrible!
Also, isn't it a pity that colleges
such as the South Bank Poly,
Coventry, Edinburgh (Patron:
HRH, alias 'the Duke' ) and
Shoreditch (to name four that I
have personal knowledge of) do
not have such an efficient team of
solicitors.
However, two years ago, ours
weren't particularly efficient
either. Boy, O h Boy! A m I glad that
they've sharpened their wits over
the last two years. Mind you, with
college taking such an active
interest in this year's Rag Mag in
general, especially its detrimental
effect upon overseas students'
fees, not to mention the fact that it
renders the occupation as totally
meaningless, this is understood.
Finally, anyone wishing to come
and help stamp ten thousand Rag
Mags with the printers' imprint,
using rubber stamps that the
printers, Minstral Press, have
s u p p l i e d us with (financial
setback of fifty pounds to
themselves) will be welcomed
with open arms.

Dear Colin,
I would like to apologize to Rae
and Steve for saying the Rag Mag
was sexist It should have read
'blatantly crude and racist' as
elsewhere in the letter. I do not,
however, withdraw anything else
There are also inaccuracies in
Rae's letter which I would like to
point out:
i. Raesaidthatthereareonlyeight
Jewish jokes and that the word
wog' appears only once Since
Rae took the trouble of counting
all the jokes, I felt that I could do
no less. She has got both of these
figures wrong. There are also
other racist jokes or words, which
do not fall in these categories, but
are no less racist for that. Having
read previous IC Rag Mags and
those of other colleges I consider
it to be more racist than most.
There are too many Irish and
Jewish jokes and it is the quantity,
as well as the quality, which
makes them offensive.
ii. If Rae read the letter carefully,
she would notice that nobody
accused her of making excuses -
only the exec. If Chris and
Malcolm had felt that strongly
about the mag, they would have
acted more decisively, instead of
opting out by disassociating
themselves from the Rag Mag.
The exec is the caretaker
government of the union during
the holiday and it was up to them
to act.
iii. Nobody in the letter used their
official position to 'give power to
their personal opinions', apart
from myself. I had the full backing
of my committee, chairtnen of
several national societies and
several students had expressed
strong opinions about it. The
others in . the letter signed
themselves as ordinary students
at IC which I thought was their
privilege, if they so wished to do
so.
According to Rae's motion at the
U G M , the Rag Mag is for
'broadminded' students. If that is
the case, then since Rae, Chris
a n d M a l c o l m d i s a s s o c i a t e d
themselves from it does that mean
that they are not broadminded? I
personally prefer to think that
they have some standard of
decency that they think should be
maintained.
IC already has a bad reputation
with other colleges about its Rag
Mag and this is not going to help
to improve that image.
Yours sincerly,
A Gujral
Dear Colin,
When will the officers of IC
Union finally realize that they do
NOT have the support of students.
As we are all aware at the last
Union meeting the motion on
education cuts was railroaded by
the U n i o n e x e c u t i v e . T h e
amendments which basically said
that we do not believe in an
occupation was defeated by the
n a r r o w e s t of m a r g i n s . A n
amendment (which I believe a
l a r g e n u m b e r of s t u d e n t s
supported) asking the Union to
support the cuts in increased
expenditure was not even allowed
to be discussed True democ-
racy?
We have been told that Ihe
occupation of the SDR was
d e s i g n e d not for m a x i m u m
d i s r u p t i o n o l C o l l e g e , but
'maximum publicity' Who rnnlly
believes that a few linos in the
Guardian and a brio! mention on
R a d i o . L o n d o n is m a x i m u m
publicity? Even Sonnet the
newspaper of London students'
does not mention the occupation
