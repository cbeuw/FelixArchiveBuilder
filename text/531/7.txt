persuade his local council that he and his
family are running a food and research
centre, trying to build a model of farming

machines and chemicals. The council

of the planners' definition of a farmer, since
his project is not commercial.

insist that Mrs Thatcher is indulging in
brinkmanship in demanding that other
countries pay more, so that the UK payments
would be roughly no more than what Britain
gets from the EEC.

Germany from Nato and East Germany from
