ICU OSC TUITION CUTS: THE FACTS
FEES ISSUE
In 1977-78 tuition tees tor overseas
students were raised by 60%. Figures ranging
Irom £ tOOmillion to £120million were quoted
as annual resource costs of overseas
students. Though these figures have been
quoted frequently there is no apparent
agreement as to how they were arrived at.
However on the basis of the available figures
the arithmetic could be: total gross cost of
overseas students to education budget -
£153million less overseas students' fees -
£30million which leaves a cost of £123million
on 1976-77
'"gures.
A report undertaken by N U S and U K C O S A
used marginal costs as the logical starting
point rather than gross costs. The basis for
this is the premise of the DES that the UK
educational system is primarily for home
students and that the overseas students
represent extra students 'on the margin'.
They also considered the benefits which
might reasonably be deducted to produce e
fairer net figure; benefits such as research
input, long-term trade benefits and foreign
exchange brought in by the students, none of
which were considered in the government's
calculations. There are other unquantifiable
benefits, such as cultural and educational
advantages derived from their presence,
w h i c h are n e i t h e r u n i m p o r t a n t or
insignificant. Using monetary arguments,
this report refutes the assertion that overseas
students are 'subsidized'.
There are some who hold the view that
education is a commodity and it should be
charged according to what the market would
stand. If this view is to be put forward then it
should be done bluntly and honestly, not
camouflaged or rationalized by baring the
discussion of overseas students fees on a
supposed subsidy. The principles behind the
'market-value' argument are different but
equally reprehensible.
Lord Ashby wrote: "At universities fees for
overseas students are much higher than
those for British students - a deplorable
policy, a sorTof intellectual import control."
Pratt, Travers and Burgess have written in
'Costs and Control in Further Education':
' T h e D E S has been simply, visibly and always
wrong." Their policies towards overseas
students is another example of this.
The government recently increased tuition
fees by 33% in 1979-60, adding to the
imbalance, claiming that 'at least 60% on
average of the total cost on tuition will still be
met from public funds.' Until the government
acknowledges the marginal cost concept and
benefits of overseas students as recipients of
subsidies whereas all the evidence suggests
that overseas students are a benefit to the UK
even on monetary terms.
More recently and worryingly. the U G C
sent a letter to the Vice-chancellors of
Universities stating that it is the government's
intention to move towards a position in which
overseas students meet the full cost of their
education and to reflect this in the U G C grant
with respect to overseas students admitted in
1980-61 and subsequent years. For example,
the U G C grant for IC, includihg all fees, is
£22.37mi llions at present and for the next
three years the grant decreases from
£20.34million (in 1980-81) to£17.29million in
1982-83, which includes fees for time
students and overseas students starting their
courses before 1980-81. In 1983-84 it will be
the same figure and this will include no fees
for overseas students, ie, they will pay the 'full
economic cost'.
The committee of Vice-chancellors and
principals reacted quickly and strongly to this
criticising the governmet for threatening the
financial future of universites whose finances
are already in a state of grave uncertainty'. Sir
Alec Morrison. Chairman of the C V C P . said
that the government proposed to remove a
substantial part of our income under the
fallacious belief that it corresponds to the
'subsidy' to overseas students, leaving
universities to recoup whatever they can by
charging the so-called 'economic fees' which
would have to be at a level far in excess of
anything charged to students anywhere else
in the world. In the opinion of the C V C P . the
effect of these policies would be potentially
disastrous and undermine institutions which
are vital national assets. The committee also
requested the Secretary of State for
Education and Science to think again.
If the fees are raised to the cost suggested
by the government, there will be a drastic
drop in numbers of overseas students in this
country as they will go to other countries,
such as America or decide to stay at home.
Only the very rich people or governments will
be able to afford the full economic cost. This
would be rather a pity as overseas students
take an active part in academic and solid
activities and provide a valuable glimpse of
their cultures. Only by living together witl we
be able to solve the problems which face us
today.
Quoting from the London conference on
overseas students report: "Universities have
always been international communities of
scholars; academic freedom has meant
freedom to share knowledge and ideas as if
national frontiers did not exist If
governments and educational authorities
generally accepted such a philosophy today
such a paper would be superfluous and
irrelevant".
A t t a b Gujral
1. A reduction in rate support grant of
£300million approximately, 50% of which is in
the education sector. The total amount spent
by local authorities on education is about
£6.500m''lion.
2. A reduction in * central government
expenditure of £55million, of which £8million
is in the university sector.
3. The dropping of the pilot scheme to
introduce mandatory awards for 16-19 year
olds and the loss of many discretionaty
awards.
4. A cut in the nursery scnool education from
£5.9million to £4million.
5. The increase in school meals by 5p to 30p.
6. The reduction in the youth opportunities
programme by £28million.
(These cuts were announced in the budget;
the details may, be found in the DES press
notice (12th June, 1979).
These cuts are only the beginning of a long
programme by the government. T h e
Secretary of State for Education and Science
has said that local authorities should be
prepared for at least a further 5% cut in rate
support grant in 1960-81 and a possible'
71/2% cut which would mean:
i. A loss of 70,000 teaching staff.
ii. Cuts in books and materials etc.
iii. Changes in statutory regulations in
schools.
iv. Changes in grants.
The R S G affects schools, polytechnics and
institutes of higher education and the
proposed cutbacks will affect the latter two
items regarding reduced intakes, possible
closure of undersubscribed courses and a
reduction in overseas student numbers.
Discretionary awards will also be badly
affected in that LEAs do not have to pay them
and as such will be cut back immediately. The
authorities cannot offset losses by raising
rates as the government has stated that it will
take action against the authorities who do
raise rates, etc.
The reduction in nursery school education
is important as many parents going to post-
secondary education and leaving a child at
the nursery may not now be able to do so,
thus causing further discrimation and
hardship.
In the university sector, the U G C have
propose a 6% decrease in home student
intake in 1980-81 from the present figures.
Prospective entry for October 1980 was to
increase above that of October 1979 from
78.000 to 79.000 A 6% reduction would leave
intake in 1980 at 73,320 which is actually
92.8% of the expected intake for that year.
Total university student population would
only decrease by 1.89%. However, in order to
preserve present standards a decrease of less
than 1.69% would be necessary in grant
allocation as many of the costs remain static
'eg 1.89% of a Rector cannot be removed).
Thus marginal costs must be used. The U G C
and C V C P calculate the short-term marginal
cost at about 50% of average costs, ie 5 x
1.89% equalling .95%. The smallest cut
considered by the U G C in recurrent grant is
21/2%. This would require a 5% reduction in
total university student numbers to maintain
standards, ie 1980-81 intake would be 80.7%
of 1979-80 intake.
However from the U G C letter (15th
October, 1979) it appears that overseas
students beginning courses from 1980-81
onwards will be asked to pay the 'full
economic cost' and by 1983-84 the U G C
grant will only cover home students.
In reply to this the C V C P have stated that
they are disturbed that the recurrent grant
will be held constant in real terms over the _
next four years less approximately 13% which
is regarded as the cost of overseas students.
Home-student numbers are projected to
increase in the n^xt few years and the 13%
lost due to overseas students may not be
recovered at all for recurrent grant to stay
constant in real money terms, it will be
impossible to continue to provide an
opportunity to qualified school-leavers to
enter into university education. Inflation and
prices are not considered.
The nation's future depends on these
students and to hinder their education in this
manner can only hinder the nation's
development. The contribution of research to
the nation is vitally important especially in
medical, scientific and technological areas
and reduction in research grants in particular
and in the university sector as a whole can
only do serious damage to the country in the
future.
Many have said that the cuts are necessar/,
but the government was elected to cut waste
in all public areas, ie £60million to help bright
pupils into assisted places in independant
schools and £200million increase in the
defence budget, it is necessary to ask if these
expenditures are essential.
So the occupation has ended on
Commemoration Day, but that does not mean
that everyone goes away and thinks that it is
all over and that they have done their bit,
because this is not the case. The occupation
has only provided a springboard from which
to start an educated college-wide campaign
against the cuts in education. It is necessary
to continue with more action, eg writing to
MPs, lobbying MPs, taking part in the week of
action in November. The next major step is to
organize that campaign effectively. This will
begin at the open meeting on Wednesday,
31st October at 1pm in the Union. Do you
care about the future of the education system
in this country?

OCCUPATION ENDS
The Occupation of the Senior
Dining Room ended at 12:15 on
Commemoration Day. THose who
Commemoration Day. Those who
took part in the occupation
together with many others
carrying placards and wearing
black armbands joined in the
"Funeral March" following the
black coffin, bourne aloft by six
students from the meeting in the
Junior Common Room outside,
through Beit and on its journey
around the Albert Hall. Students
were already leafleting the
parents and other visitors to the
ceremony in the Albert Hall.
The decision to end the
occupation on Commemoration
Day was taken after a majority
vote at Tuesday's meeting.

Students at Bradford University
went into occupation on Tuesday
after it was decided at their Union
g e n e r a l m e e t i n g t h a t a n
occupation would be a good way
of gaining publicity for their
opposition to the proposed
education cuts. Approximately
one hundred students are now

embassy, on Tuesday, in protest
against the imprisonment of six
human rights activists. The
demonstrators included several
MPs, and three students from IC.
The jail sentences ranged from a
two year suspended sentence to
four and a half years for dramatist
Vaclav Havel. The two day trial
was the biggest Czech dissident
trial since 1972.
