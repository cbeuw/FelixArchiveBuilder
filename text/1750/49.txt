What is this thing?
Our intention this year was to do more graphs and properly visualize the data while cross
comparing different categories. We did not want you to have to read much as we
know you are all too busy hanging out with your 6 closest friends in the pub until 10 pm.
Despite sex being a bit of a taboo subject, Imperial students love divulging their sex
lives on anonymous online forms with over 2000 of you putting it all out there for the
Felix team to see. What we concluded overall, is that we are having sex and there is
no right or wrong way to do it, except for maybe the small minority of you who put feet
stuff as a kink. When it comes to sexual health whether it be STIs or harassm-
ent, there is still some way to go with bringing these issues to light amongst
our community. We hope you are excited for the next few pages which
are busting at the seams with fun analysis of
the sex lives of the Imperial students.
