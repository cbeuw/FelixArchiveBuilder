On the surface, the Oatly boycott
appears as though the action is sim-
ply to ‘cancel’ the company. However,
delving deeper into the conversations
held between those in sustainability
communities online we see how people
feel like this boycott is to keep the
company to account to their commit-
ment for climate and social justice and
promise ‘to be a good company’. Oatly
claims that they are the most ethical
and environmentally friendly option
of milk-type beverage. Therefore, these
customers expected more from the
company, but they would be willing to
support Oatly again if they were to do a
U-turn.
Oatly recently published their accept-
ance of investment from the private
equity firm Blackstone, the part-owner
of 2 Brazilian firms contributing to the
destruction of the Amazon rainforest,
responsible for the forced evictions
of families after the 2008 economic
crisis and with a CEO donating to the
Trump administration. The boycotters
are not just against the acceptance of
money from such a firm which profits
off exploitation and injustice, but also
the fact that Oatly’s customers will be
creating profit for Blackstone through
green business. Plus, Blackstone is
using this investment as an opportuni-
ty to greenwash their company. Oatly
could have chosen a better investor con-
sidering their efforts on sustainability
reporting and marketing, but they have
been forthcoming on the possibilities
this investment gives them to grow and
globalise the business. So, should we
oat-drinkers boycott Oatly if we care so
much for the future of the planet? We
here at Felix sustainability are not going
to tell you what to do. This is something
you must figure out. Does Oatly align
with your values? Maybe you would like

Back in July, Oatly, the oat milk
company that’s been popping up in
every supermarket and coffee shop ac-
cepted a $200 million investment from
Blackstone, one of the biggest private
equity firms in the world. Soon after,
the climate activist @LessWasteLaura
urged her twitter followers to boycott
Oatly. She discovered that Blackstone
funded a Brazilian infrastructure
project which involved deforesting the
Amazon rainforest. Frustrated, Laura
claimed that she doesn’t “want my mon-
ey going to the destruction of the planet
and putting people’s lives and land at
risk just so that I can have a creamy
coffee in the morning!”. The twitter
thread went viral, and suddenly, Oatly
was ‘cancelled’.
It’s true that Oatly’s goal is to ‘deliver
products that have maximum nutrition-
al value and minimal environmental
impact’. Accepting this investment
seems like the last thing a plant-based,
sustainable company should be doing.
After all, aren’t they putting money in
the pockets of the evil Blackstone that’s
destroying our planet, one tree at a
time?
What we must understand when
we read stories like this, is that there’s
always a bigger picture when it comes to
sustainability - it requires compromises.
By boycotting com-
panies like Oatly, the
only thing we’re doing
is holding back the
progress of sustainable
businesses.
Oatly could have
found a different inves-
tor with a clean track
record. But unfortu-
nately, most prominent
investors are linked in
some way to projects that contribute
to the destruction of our planet. It
would’ve been an enormous challenge
for Oatly to find an investment size
sufficient to reach their large-scale goals,
without an initial trade-off.
According to Oatly, the company
needed funding to meet its growing
global demands. Using the money from
Blackstone, as well as a $200 million
green deal bank loan, they’re planning
to build more factories in Asia, Europe
and the US. The result of this will be
that Oatly, a producer of the most
environmentally friendly milk alter-
native, will
be on more
supermarket
shelves than
ever. Oat
milk will be
accessible
to a broader
audience,
and every
pint of dairy
milk that is
replaced with oat milk is a step towards
a smaller impact on our climate. Isn’t
this what we want?
Blackstone’s decision to invest in
Oatly also encourages and pressures
both big and small investors to put their
money into ‘greener’ projects (which
is how Oatly justifies this decision in
a statement on their website). This
approach diverts these huge investments
away from companies that don’t view
sustainability as a priority and sets a
precedent for said companies to change
this. Oatly’s explanation sends exactly
this message: “With global private
equity working toward a green future,
we actually have a chance of saving the
planet for future generations”. If finan-
cial institutions are to consider compa-
nies’ environmental footprint in their
investment decisions, we must start
speaking their language: profit.
Of course, companies that claim to
be sustainable should be held accounta-
ble for the decisions they make. I think
if society accepted all the decisions that
sustainable businesses made without
question, we would be setting ourselves
back in the fight against climate change.
But to create real, long-term change,
instead of immediately ‘cancelling’ busi-
nesses like Oatly, we must allow them to
learn while growing- only this can show
investors and corporations that sustain-
ability is the future.

Oatly should be

In light of recent events
many oat fanatics
have lost hope in there
being a truly sustaina-
ble oat milk option in
the supermarket. Yes,
that’s right, in a capi-
talist world there is no
such thing as ethical
consumption. Who
would've thought?
However, a way of re-
ducing emissions relat-
ed to the transport and
production of putting
oat milk in a carton is
to make your own at
home. The post-milk
generation have decid-
ed to drop the drama
and make their own
oat beverage seeing as
the process is relatively
simple and cheap.
Here is our recipe that
hopefully won’t come
out too slimy for you:
1. Blend together 3
cups of water and a
pitted medjool date.
2. Add ½ cup of rolled
oats to the mix and
blend all together with
a pinch of salt for 30
seconds (for a powerful
blender). To make oat
milk for a foamy latte
add in a teaspoon of
coconut oil to the mix.
3. Strain the mix
through a fine sieve
tapping the sides to
let liquid through and
careful not to push
through with a spoon.
4. Use milk straight
away or store in fridge
for up to 4 days.
5. Don’t over blend as
this will cause it to go
slimy. Don’t heat up as
it will thicken, less if
you add in the coconut
oil to make it suitable
for coffee. Don’t pre-
soak oats because this
will also make the milk
drink a slimy texture.
