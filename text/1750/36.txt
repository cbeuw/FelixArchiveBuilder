Lockdown has become an incredibly
controversial step which was taken
in hopes of flattening the curve and sav-
ing lives. The high cost of this strategy
was seen in the steep GDP fall in the
second quarter of 2020 – worse than
any other G7 country. Yet, this nosedive
doesn’t show the full picture. Not all in-
dustries were hit the same. It’s obvious
how the hospitality industry was going
to be dealt a more damaging hand by the
restriction due to the very nature of their
work but the government’s poor oversite
was the nail to the coffin for many food
businesses,forcingthemtocloseupshop
or stop serving in the UK.
In late March, Boris Johnson ad-
dressed the nation and embedded into
ourcollectiveconsciousnessthecostume
changing slogan while mandating the
closure of all non-essential shops – the
beginning of lockdown. Yet, before this
speech, he had already been addressing
thenation,attemptingtosoothethepeo-
ple of their fears and give the direction
the so dearly sought. In these addresses,
he struck the first blow. He ever so po-
litely encouraged that people stay away
from pubs and restaurants yet not in-
structing the businesses to close. Restau-
rants were put in their first uncomfort-
able situation. Overnight their clientele
plummeted. Keeping their door open

would be closing their door of their own
volition, they wouldn’t be able to collect
any insurance money to allow them to
pay the fixed costs that
would be pilling on no
matter their serving
status.
Restaurants did
what they could to
mitigate for this be-
fore the lockdown
started and some in-
ventive projects and
new normals were
born that are showing
staying power even as
restrictions ease. They assured their cus-
tomers that they would be taking all the
precautions they could while handling
food. It’s common to put one’s life in
their hands in mitigating for allergies
after all. Quickly, you saw servers wear-
ing mask and forcing people to use hand
sanitiser before it became cool. Still the
numbers were dwindling.
Once lockdown hit, they also found
some inventive ways to build commu-
nity, sharing recipes on Instagram and
Facebook live. Restaurants and food
stalls even found a way to bring your fa-
vourite dishes home with you outside of
delivery. Meal kits became the food fad
of lockdown. At a click of a button, you
could have the restaurant quality ingre-
dients from the places you were craving
delivered to your door to make with
your family once you became tired of
banana bread. You quickly become a star
chef (with the help of some very thor-
ough instructions) to wow
your family or entertain
the household after
the third New
Girl binge by
trying to
make sense
of the in-
struction
togeth-
er and
all be-
come line
c o o k s
trying to
meet the
demands of
the dinner time
rush.
At this point,
things weren’t ideal, but
they were getting there.
Those that made I out of the
other side of this tri-
al by fire were com-
ing back stronger
than ever. Places were
opening for delivery
and were able to di-
versify their audience
while spreading their
reach. And it looked
like things were really
changing for the better
once the Eat Out To Help Out Scheme
was introduced. It sounded too good to
be true. Half off all eat in meals up to a
£10 off per person. No voucher needed.
AsmanytimesasyouwantedfromMon-
day to Wednesday all
through August. All
the restaurant had
to so was sign up for
the scheme and they
could claim back
the discount from
the government
so it could be used
on conjunction
with any deals they
would be running
themselves on those
day. Suddenly they could entice people
to restaurants by offering them whole
restaurant meals for little over the price
of a Tesco meal deal. Everybody hopped
on this wave. Even the bougiest restau-
rants in town like Novikov
were getting involved
because they had
nothing to lose.
Or so they
thought.
In real-
ity. the
t i m e
frame of
M o n -
day to
Wednes-
day of
the deal
meant that
e v e r y o n e
would pack
themselves like
socially distanced
sardines to any restau-
rant that would take them. After
so long of people being out of work this
was a logistical nightmare for owners.
Restaurants aren’t just about the food
but also the service and if that faltered,
their reputations would take a hit. They
knew so many were using the scheme as
a way to try out new restaurants. They
need they had to ensure retention. In
order to maintain quality, restaurants
had to put more people on their payroll
and work them to the bone to come out
the other side of those three days a week.
Yet they also had the problem of ghost
towns for the rest of the week, now with
too much staff and nothing to do with
them. Outside of the scheme days, res-
taurant floors were so barren, you could
see a tumbleweed rolling by if you
squinted. This was not sustainable
business.
A deal like EO-
THO also meant
that the perceived
value of restaurant
food fell in the
public view. Let’s
be real, lockdown
has taught us that
are cooking skills
aren’t what we
may hype them up to be when left with
no other options. At a restaurant, you
pay for the experience, ease and quality.
But with EOTHO, the line of thought
quickly became why would someone pay
full price for a meal at a restaurant when
you know it can be gotten for £10 less.
Many restaurants caved to this pressure.
Fearing that their sales would plummet
due to people not wanting to fork up the
extra cash for something they were get-
ting half off just a day ago, they extend-
ed eat out to help out into September.
Some again in October. And this was
all without Rishi’s big pot of unlimited
money but rather this already struggling
businesses taking it on the chin them-
selves and paying the £10 out of pocket
for each diner. Some just couldn’t han-
dle the heat. Even some world famous
restaurants like Dominique Ansel Bak-
ery had to close up shop after August be-
cause they knew that they couldn’t keep
doing business without the help of the
scheme. No one was safe.
Yes, this scheme helped restaurants,
but it wasn’t just for their benefit or
else the deal wouldn’t have only applied
to eating in. If take away was included,
restaurants would not have to put their
staff at risk to ensure they made a profit.
The deal could have had more days. They
could have even This was about getting
people outside of their house where they
would be using public transport, shop-
ping and stimulating other sectors of the
economy that were affected by everyone
being shut in. So all the problems for the
restaurants were acceptable if it meant
that everyone else was getting this boost,
leaving restaurants to pick up the pieces
themselves once again.
