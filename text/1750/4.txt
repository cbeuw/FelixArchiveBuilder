The situation is now very bad. Hun-
dreds of students are locked down
in their flats. The questions on every-
one’s mind is could the students or the
university have put in place measures to
avoid this or is the fate of Murano one
that will be replicated in halls across the
country including at Imperial.
With lectures, societies and sports all
online, Dan explained that it was diffi-
cult to get a sense of community. “It’s ei-
ther you sit in your room, and waste the
first week of fresher’s when you’re meant
to try to meet people and get some form
of a social group going so that you’re not
alone during the first part of uni or you
just don’t get sick. So it really is no com-
petition in people’s eyes.” Coupling this
with the fact that social distancing was
just not possible in student halls, Dan
told Felix that everyone accepted they
would get the virus saying it was “mu-
tually agreed upon” and “unavoidable”.
Social gatherings in halls which were
definitely the big spreader had to hap-
pen as there was “no other way to meet
people” as online events did not work in
practice.
Some efforts were made by police to
enforce social distancing, with about 30
officers patrolling the hall every night,
according to Dan, breaking up social
gatherings. The lack of consistency in
the actions of these officers hinted that
no official guidance had been given to
them with how to deal with the unique
situation presented to them by the halls
of residence.
After about a week, students in the
hall started developing symptoms, these
would usually last just a few days and
they would feel better. When some stu-
dents did go and get tested and returned
a positive test the whole flat would have
to self isolate with the accommodation
services plastering a “do not enter” sign
on the flat door. In Dan’s case, it took
him 3 days to get a test after developing
symptoms and the walk in center was 40
mins across town (there has since been
a mobile unit set up outside the hall).
Once in self isolation, students could use
their kitchens and bathrooms, and some
neighbouring flats which were both in
self-isolation would hang out together.
In flats with high risk people, the other
flatmates took extra precautions.
The mental toll of this was quite hard
Dan explains, “It’s it’s very much sort of
everyone in the same boat kind of men-
tality, but it’s also quite dim because
everyone’s aware that this was not what
the beginning of university is meant to
be like and that we’re sort of missing out
on this really enjoyable, fun experience
where kids are really meant to come out
oftheirownshellsandreallyexplorenew
territory and meet new people.” There
is no longer the sense of FOMO which
was around during the first week as
everyone was self isolating and students
were looking forward to putting this all
