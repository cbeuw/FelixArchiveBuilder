Socks, the most unobtrusive and most disregarded
item of clothing. This simple piece of attire is oft
hidden behind dastardly shoes and sly trousers. Kept
out of sight and out of mind. Yet, these
nylons play a most pivotal role in our
everyday lives. Without socks how
could we brave the world? How could
we escape the chilly floors underfoot
or the rough innards of our shoes?
Bereft of socks we’d be as feeble as
a wee babe, still coddled by a moth-
er’s embrace. We were born without
them, but we shouldn’t have to live
like that! I myself was granted the
gift of covering myself with these
feet coverings mere moments af-
ter my birth. They say my rapture
for socks at a young age was a
clear sign that I was of a boy
destined for greatness. Or
perhaps, a boy destined to
enlighten the world on the correct method of
sock maintenance, wear and style?
But I digress. Whether you’re a worker, a
scholar or a leader, we are all beholden to our
socks. For without them how could we protect
our delicate toes from the harsh realities
of the modern world? Shoes? No!
Shoes could not exist without socks.
Society could not exist without
shoes. And mankind could not
exist without society. (QED) It
does not matter whether you
wear cotton, silk or wool-
ly, prefer sports, boot, or
thigh-high. Embrace
mismatched socks, or
even the ones adorned
with little avocadoes -
a personal favourite of
mine. By clothing your
foot in fabric tubing,
you are upholding a tradi-
tion as ancient and magnifi-
cent as mankind.
And for this, I
salute you, my Good
Sirs, Madams and
those that are neither
of the two. But alas,
my time here comes to a
close. While I must go I
hope that you remember
me in each foot and in
the warmth offered by
my undergarment of
choice. I pray you’ve
managed to understand
the underlying importance and
value of socks. Not to mention the
array of designs, we really are spoilt for
choice. And as we stand strong together
during these troubled and uncertain times, I
hope you can find happiness in the small things.
For its often those things we miss that can provide
a spark of joy, even if it is just a simple pair of odd
socks.
