FELIX SEX SURVEY 2020
MASTURBATE? WATCH PORN?
How often do people...
15.05% of virgins never masturbate
6.08% of non-virgins never masturbate
Virgins are 2.48times more likely to never masturbate
25.46% of virgins never watch porn
18.52% of non-virgins never watch porn
Virgins are 37%more likely to never watch porn
What porn do people watch?
Interestingly, there are significant differences
in masturbation and porn frequencies when
broken down by sex.
Females tend to masturbate and watch porn
significantly less than males. This is in line
with many scientific studies which observed
that females have lower sex drives or experi-
ence sexual desire less frequently than males.
However, many of these studies do not consider
the various psychological and contextual factors
that may influence sex drive, and neither have
we.
When it comes to watching porn and mastur-
bating in the LGBTQ+ community, there are some
clear trends. First of all, asexuals by far are the
least likely to do any of this which makes sense
as asexuality is defined as the experiencing little
to no sexual attraction. Amongst the rest, of the
community, the habits are quite similar to straight
people with the slight exception of homosexuals
who watch more porn and masturbate more.

When it comes to watching porn and mastur-
bation, aero and computing are the champions!
These champions often had masturbated within
the last hour, and while Felix does not know when
each respondent answered this survey and thus
cannot know if the deed was done between lectures
or whether reading Felix is their masturbation
routine at home, it does recommend a heavy
dose of hand sanitizer after shaking hands with
them. On the other extreme are the life sciences
students, watching almost half the porn and
masturbated almost half as much as aero and
computing. Results were normalised for
department size (of course) so this could be down
to the gender differences across these courses.
