As we’re all heading back to uni and the weather
turns colder, we’re back in fashion’s best season
for layering! Read below for a little overview of what
pieces and styles will shine this season!
This iconic piece has been around for several seasons,
but it is still there and evolving with interesting addi-
tions and a twist! This season, they are seen oversize
(of course) and belted, but also – and this is fresh and
striking: cropped! Yes still oversized fit on the shoul-
ders but cropped slightly above or at the waist! This
cool twist, gives such an edgy and distinctive shape!
Like the original blazer, it works well as a matching
2-piece suit, however you can also style it with high
waisted jeans. This will emphasise nice pants and high-
light your waist or even show a bit of tummy on
warmer days!
Another hot trend
incorporating the
blazer is the 2-piece
suit with a skirt. It
has been seen a lot
recently! Careful it
is not a workwear
pencil skirt, but a
shorter and straight
skirt, that can look
like the extension
of the blazer for a
perfect preppy and
stylish look.
A lot of amazing
leather pieces were
seen on the runways,
and many were not
in the classic black!
The brown palette
tones like beige,
caramel, maroon,
rust are per-fect for
autumn! Trousers
are an easy piece to
use for this trend, in a loose and straight cut, and work
well with all other materials like knitwear and coats.
Also, shirts made of lovely leather have been seen
quite a lot, worn open as a
second layer or closed as a top.
PS: a shirt/ jacket is called a
shacket (yes it is a thing ap-
parently!). Long leather boots
were seen in all shades, boldly
overtaking the basic black. To
conclude, the full leather look
is welcomed and even encour-
aged. For the most daring of
you, try in a sleeve-less jacket
and bermuda or a full-length
dress with boots.
After the focus on sleeves in previous seasons, it is
collar time. This season they are large, embroidered,
asymmetric… This is seen in an array of materials
(crisp white poplin,
knit, leather, hint
hint…) and the collar
becomes the centre
of attention of the
look. It is a very work
appropriate trend, on
the more chic side,
especially on a white
shirt. If you’re more
of a casual style you
can try the knitwear
version, which is also
much warmer for those
chilly autumn days!
The cardigan worn
as a top was already a
big trend last season,
and it’s still here this
autumn, incorporating
the collar addition or
some frill detail!
Seen everywhere since
the autumn collections
have been released
from catwalks to high
street brands, some-
thing I had seen creep-
ing last season is now fully entering the fashion scene:
vests aka sleeve-less, but on jumpers. It gives a totally
different look from the full sleeve ones, and it’s perfect
for layering! With
a nice plain shirt
for a monochrome
combination
(looking so chic
and effortless
in whites and
creams) or with a
trendy pattern to
elevate that look
with pieces that
grab attention.
They can give you the full preppy look that we love!
They are seen paired with wide legged trousers or cig-
arette pants. The only issue in this trend for me in our
not so warm climate… is potentially getting cold arms?
Oh well it’s all for fashion, right?
Shoes wise, boots are always the star of the show in
autumn/ winter. This year, they are flat, mid-rise,
rounded boots with a thick sole! I think they look like
a mix between combat boots and Chelsea boots. The
original is by Bottega Veneta, but now many other
brands have taken up the style and they will be every-
where this autumn. They are more versatile than com-
bat boots as you can still use them in a chic look. You
can style them beautifully with a girly baby doll dress
to break the look or with a blazer dress and a mini bag
(yes, as with the few previous seasons the tinier the
better with bags!). Another way to style the boots, in
a more rock or street style, is paired with boyish pants
or jeans tucked into the boots, yes, we want to be bold
and really elevate the looks this season.
Been loving this trend on runways since it arrived!
The chains are big and gold and adorn everything
from handbags to jackets to jumper collars and not
forgetting jewellery. For a more chic and minimalist
style, dainty little chains work and for a more daring
and bolder look, a chunky chain will be the star of the
outfit. My favourites were the Stella McCartney chain
on handbag look and the Balmain oversized chain
single earring.
