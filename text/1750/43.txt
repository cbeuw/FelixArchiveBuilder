Airlines have felt the pain of the
coronavirus more than other com-
panies. Almost overnight, the bulk of
their business ceased. But in mid-2020
there was at least hope
that Covid might not
be as virulent as first
thought; that warm-
er months would
bring some respite;
that travel corridor
agreements allowing
passengers to fly be-
tween two countries
without quarantine
might not get people
back in the air.
Now, almost eight
months into the
pandemic, with cit-
ies re-entering lock-
down and likely vac-
cine months away, it’s
apparent there will
be no quick come-
back. International
air traffic in July was
92% below 2019 lev-
els, International Air
Transport Associa-
tion figures show. More than 400,000
airline jobs have been cut since February,
according to data compiled by Bloomb-
erg. People are not going to get back and
travel as they did before until there’s a
vaccine that’s been widely distributed.
British Airways CEO says the air-
line is “fighting for survival” and said
it’s restructuring or die. Airlines in the
U.S. are expected to layoff thousands of
additional workers when the coronavi-
rus aid expired at the beginning of this
month- with over 29,000 already laid off
by United Air.
In Europe, a pickup in air traffic in
July and August, as vacationers sought
to escape monthlong lockdowns, has
abruptly gone into reverse. Lufthansa
is preparing for more in-depth job and
fleet cuts. According to IATA, 25 mil-
lion jobs are at risk. More staff reduc-
tions are coming.

small. That would indicate Asia may be
on the cusp of a torrent of cuts. Gov-
ernment aid has
helped, but there
may not be more
thy a do. Carriers
in Europe alone
received $29 bil-
lion in aid, state-
backed-loans, and
other forms of
support through
Aug 27.
With airline
stockpricesplung-
ing, attracting
new investment
is getting harder.
Warren Buffet has
completely exited
his stakes. Richard
Branson’s Virgin
Atlantic is under-
going a £1.2 bil-
lion rescue built
around a loan
fromahedgefund.
The pandemic is
pushing airline Virgin Australia into
the hands of private equity. In the U.S.,
Delta was able to raise 49 billion in the
industry’s largest-ev-
er debt sale. America
airlines sold $6.8 bil-
lion of debt in June.
Aircraft is in a crisis
of their own. A third
of the world’s 26,000
passenger jets remain
grounded, packed
in deserts or lined
up in rows along the
tarmac, aviation data
provider Cirium says.
Fleet reductions
are squeezing plane
makers. Airbus re-
ceived only one order in August, and
Boeing is fighting to stop cancellations
of its 737 Max, which was grounded
after two fatal crashes. Airlines are also
seeking to defer previously ordered
planes. Corporate travel may never re-
cover as businesspeople everywhere real-
ize they can close deals and get the job
done over Zoom and from home even.
Leisure travel is expected to spring back
once there’s an effective vaccine, but
tourists will probably be more cautious.
Jaunts to far-flung places where medical
help is remote may hold less appeal.
Wizz Air Holdings relaunched ser-
vices more aggressively than any other
European carrier but has since hit the
brakes, freezing capacity plans for the
fourth quarter at current levels. Norwe-
gian Air Shuttle ASA has dumped its
signature model of low-cost transatlan-
tic flights until at least next year.
After cutting planes, pilots, and crew,
airlines are tearing into ground services
such as baggage handling as well as fixed
costs such as property. Qantas has said
it might require shiftiest Australia-wide
property review.

An investment
bank is a financial
services company
that acts as an in-
termediary in large
and complex finan-
cial transactions.
An investment bank
is usually involved
when a start-up com-
pany prepares for its
launch of an initial
public offering (IPO)
and when a corpo-
ration merges with
a competitor. It also
has a role as a broker
or financial adviser
for large institutional
clients such as pen-
sion funds.
Global investment
banksincludeJPMor-
gan Chase, Goldman
Sachs, Morgan Stan-
ley, Citigroup, Bank
of America, Credit
Suisse, and Deutsche
Bank.
An investment
bank can act as a fi-
nancial advisor to
large institutional
investors; an invest-
ment bank may pro-
vide strategic advice
on a variety of finan-
cial matters, work in
mergers and acqui-
sitions by providing
estimates of the value
of a potential acqui-
sition and negotiate
a fair price for it, and
provide research ser-
vices on companies
that institutional in-
vestors can use.
I am too embarassed to ask... What is an investment bank?
