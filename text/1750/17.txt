New world order scientists gave a press conference
today in which they expressed their sadness and
disappointment in announcing the postponning of
COVID-20.
The highly anticipated sequel to the already iconic
COVID-19 had been in the works for several years
and had recently passed its final clinical vaccine tri-
als. New world order lead scientist Feil Nerguson told
NegaFelix that it was a huge disappointment to the
team. “We had already made the vaccine, had a brand-
ing campaign and the early access microchip free
vaccines were ready to ship to all the billionaires that
had ordered them. But because of social distancing
we can’t get to them and are having to watch years of
work go down the drain. It is heartrenching”
With the major New world order labs shut down
due to the social distancing requirements there has
been a rethink of the architecture.
An unnamed source told NegaFelix that the pre-
vious preference for narrow corridors, huge pits and
limited ventilation had really hurt their profit margin.
“It is really frustrating to
see the non evil labs getting
on with work because they in-
cluded ventilation and didn’t
use up floor space on piranna
pits. Mr Gates is furious”
Other leaders of the Bil-
derberg group also agreed to
speak to us.
George Soros told NegaFe-
lix that the fall in commercial
air travel was playing havock
with his chemtrail program
to sterilise the population and
turn everybody gay. “If there
are no planes then there are no
trails. I have had to get onto
the Tube with a little aerosol
hidden under my jumper and
spray it when no one is look-
ing. And everybody is wear-
ing a mask so they aren’t even
breathing in the fumes! It is
enough to make me cry!”
Mark Zuckerberg was similarly
disappointed.HeandJeffBezoshad
been planning on moving beyond
stealing your data and over charging
you to actually stealing your phones
and your wallets.
Their new initiative promises
“non consensual removal of wal-
lets and phones, extortion, drug
trafficking and lots of other really
exciting business opportunities to
investors.
They have already raised several
billion in venture capital funding.
