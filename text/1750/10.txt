Typically produced by anaerobic
bacteria in oxygen-starved envi-
ronments such as
sewers and wet
soils, phosphine is
generated via the
reduction of phos-
phates. It has been
foundongasgiants
such as Jupiter and
Saturn, however
these planets host
the somewhat ex-
treme conditions
required to pro-
duce it physically;
these happen to be
closer to the cores
where high temperatures and pressures
exist, and it is brought to the outer layers
of their atmospheres post-production by
convection.
Theseconditionsdonotexistonrocky
planets like Venus, leaving the scientists
who first discovered the presence of Ve-
nusian phosphine perplexed. The James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), situ-
ated in Hawaii, collected the initial data
fromobservationsof VenusinJune2017
where a blip in the spectrum at
a wavelength of 1.23mm
was first spotted. Light at
this wavelength was no-
tably lacking, creating what
is called an ‘absorption line’ in
the spectrum. This wavelength
corresponds to a specific tran-
sition in phosphine - the fact
that the absorption line
was at this wavelength
indicated that there
could be phosphine
in the atmosphere,
absorbing those pho-
tons to gain energy, taking
them away from the light spectrum that
would eventually reach the JCMT. Fur-
ther confirmation of this absorption line
was sought with data collected at the At-
acama Large Millimetre/submillimetre
Array (ALMA).
This data was astounding - any phos-
phine in the atmos-
phereof Venusisex-
pected to react and
oxidise to become
phosphates, par-
ticularly due to the
energy provided by
the ultraviolet radi-
ation from the Sun,
leading to a decay
rate in the amount
of phosphine. The
fact that a detect-
able amount of
phosphine exists
in the atmosphere
indicates that the decay rate is matched
with a production rate, i.e. an equilibri-
um has been reached, in this case at an
abundance of 20ppb (parts per billion).

phine production.

chemistry or geochemistry, or possibly
life.”
Venus has not
been a major
candidate in the
search for life, pri-
marily due to the
incredibly hostile
surface conditions
– hot enough to
melt lead, and a
pressure 90 times
that on the surface
of the Earth. “Carl
Sagan called Venus
hell” remarked Dr
David Clements,
one of the Imperi-
al astrophysicists who co-authored the
paper. Despite these surface conditions,
other regions of Venus could be more
hospitable to life; mainly droplets in its
clouds. But ‘more hos-
pitable’ is still a far
cry from the rela-
tive luxuries we ex-
perience on Earth.

made of wonderful
substances – sul-
furic acid!” joked

Phosphine (PH3
), a toxic gas produced by microbes, has been found in the atmosphere of Venus with no known non-biological
explanation. Felix discussed this with the two Imperial astrophysicists who co-authored the paper on this fascinating discovery.
