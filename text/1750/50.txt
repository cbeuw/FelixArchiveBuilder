Over 2000 people took the survey
this year! We broke down the
basic demography of our survey
respondants by looking at depart-
ment, gender, age, and status.
Females make up 40% of re-
spondants, which is a slightly
optimistic representation of the
actual Imperial gender ratio.
Our data is most represenata-
tive of Undergrad life - possibly
because our advertising didn’t
reach as many Postgrads/Alumni,
but probably because they also
have better things to do than fill
out a sex survey.
21% of respondents overall
identify as non-heterosex-
ual. This is much higher
than the rate reported by the
National Office of Statistics,
who found in 2017 that 2.0%
of the UK population identify
as lesbian/gay/bisexual, and
4.2% of those aged 16-24.
Interestingly, Felix Sex
Surveys over the past 5
years have all reported that
around 20% of respondants
are not straight.
To further look into sexuality and its fluidity, we
decided to ask respondents to rate their sexual
depositions. This analysis is known as the Kinsey
scale, invented to demonstrate that sexuality
cannot be strictly categorised.

Compared to Felix Sex Survey data from previous years, we found
that relatively high percentage of respondents are virgins. However,
the dataset we gathered this year had the largest number of respond-
ents by far (up to 150% larger than some years!).

We now see a higher propor-
tion of respondents who aren’t
100% heterosexual. A 2015 YouGov
analysis found 56% of those aged 18-24
in the UK were not 100% heterosexual.
