The worryingly warrow wustainability
concept of many ‘Green’ Companies
The main reason for green compa-
nies accepting large investments
is to scale-up and sell in more markets
across the world. Yet, there is a strong
consensus for the incompatibility of
capitalist growth and sustainability. You
could say the same for globalisation and
sustainability. According to the scholar,
Vandana Shiva, the development of the
market can’t solve the crisis as it creates
it. Therefore, having goals such as dom-
inating the global market show a lack of
true care for the crises, we have put our-
selves in. Instead of trying to dominate
the world market, a more sustainable
option would be to help support local
collectives across the world and starting
these where there is already demand.
Many green companies focus on en-
vironmental impact of production but
evade the importance of social impact
for sustainability. For ex-
ample, Oatly’s
sustainability
re-
ports
do not
account
for ex-
ternalities
of pack-
aging post
it’s consumer
usage, yet they
claim the ‘climate
footprint from
our production is
virtually non-exist-
ent’. The packaging can
be ‘easily recycled’ with
the correct facilities, but
this puts the responsibility
onto the consumer to recy-
cle properly, which depends
on the local authorities having proper
facilities and practices.
There is a lack of advanced recycling
services across the globe and so a lot of
packaging is not recycled and goes into
landfill; in 2018, 16% of Oatly’s cartons
were recycled in the USA and 35% in
the UK. The dependence on recycling
in this way is not a circular
business model, and the
reliance on customers
to recycle is not for-
ward-thinking. Focusing
on recycling sustains
and bolsters the dis-
posable culture driving
ecological collapse. Plus,
many authorities send
their landfill abroad to
MAPA (Most Affected
People and Areas), plac-
es that were colonised
and historically margin-
alised in the globe. Due
to a variety of factors,
one being structural
adjustment policies,
often these countries do not have the
same capacity to recycle or process the
enormous amount of waste shipped to
them creating hazardous health risks
for communities and environmental
injustice.
Taking the word ‘sustainability’ to
solely mean environmental footprint
is a common but dangerous mistake to
make. If production is not fully circu-
lar, it cannot be considered sustainable
since waste is a modern human creation.
Celine Semaan, the founder of the
Slow Factory, says that sustainability
shouldn’t just be about making cleaner
production, it must be about reducing
consumption.
A hotly debated topic within sus-
tainability communities online is the
symbiosis of capitalism and sustainabili-
ty. Marx’s metabolic rift theory explains
that capitalism disturbs the metabolic
interaction between human bIeings
and the planet on which they live, for
example, large-scale industry impover-
ishes workers and large-scale agriculture
deteriorates the soil. For this reason, his
writings describe the only lasting path
to sustainability being the consideration
of land as communal property. For-prof-
it companies are required to act selfishly
in the capitalist context so they cannot
be depended upon to ‘save the world’,
even if they are ‘green’. Greening also
only focuses on one
aspect of
sustainabil-
ity, leaving
out ethics,
social justice
and circular-
ity.
Since
capitalism is
inherently
designed to
destroy and
extract from
nature, there
is no ethical
consump-
tion under
capitalism,
and some argue that reforming the
system is not enough; instead we need
re-design and re-construction. There-
fore, green capitalism doesn’t solve our
current situation of ecological and cli-
mate breakdown. Power and greed char-
acterise our system, so even in a greener
context, there is still profit being made
through exploitation and injustices.
It is worrying to see companies like
Oatly claim that our future can be saved
by sustainable business and that we can
trust green capitalist companies to be
enough. The climate crisis is happening
now; people are being affected right
now, and these new flavours of capi-
talism, be it green or vegan will stop it.
Green business models are often less
harmful to the environment than tra-
ditional models, yet they are still rarely
actually beneficial to the earth.
The ongoing dominance of individ-
ualism manifests itself in a focus upon
green business and green growth. More
radical changes and models should be
adapted to reverse climate and stop
ecological breakdown, such as shifting
to a post-growth economic world with
a major scaling down of resource and
energy use in the Global North. So-
cio-economic relations will need to be
radically transformed to heal the fissure
between humans and nature. To release
the exploitative burden off MAPA, we
need collective shifting towards local
food sourcing, regenerative systems and
land reparations to allow for recovery of
pillaged communities. In this way, the
Global North may be able to re-learn
the finite extent of resources and recon-
nect with local methods of production
depending on the environmental condi-
tions. Focusing on ecological growth in-
stead of economic growth is needed for
more equitable well-being and health of
all organisms.
