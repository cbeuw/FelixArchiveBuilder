ever more pronounced in the early twentieth century.
As industrialisation and the invention of new tech-
nologies like photography and phonographs gave the
masses an increased access to artistic media, it got a lot
harder to gatekeep the institutions of Art. Decrying
certain artistic principles as “lowbrow” or, god-forbid,
“popular” became a powerful tool in preserving the
status quo and controlling discourse around the arts.
What is particularly baffling is how transparent this
technique is, yet the concept endures. One only has to
look at the terms highbrow and lowbrow themselves
to notice the connection to questionable skull-based
studies and the way the labels are applied further
makes a mockery of the distinction. Shakespeare, with
its bawdy genital-based humour and cloying melodra-
ma was the Elizabethan equivalent of today’s Holly-
wood blockbusters and yet is quoted and performed
today as the height of sophistication. The Mona Lisa,
with her hairline plucked back and eyebrows suspi-
ciously absent was the epitome of highbrow art, and
yet its popularity would prove to be its downfall. It is
decidedly highbrow to study Da Vinci and his con-
temporaries but to name the Mona Lisa as a favourite
or an inspiration is decidedly lowbrow and common,
like calling Call Me Maybe a musical masterpiece. It
isn’t so much the content of the work which confers
status – by all accounts, Call Me Maybe is a gen-
re-defining moment of pure genius – but the way it is
viewed and the audience who views it. In a post-mod-
ernist landscape of blank canvases, Tracey Emin’s My
Bed is lauded as ground-breaking fine art and my
unmade bed is reported to Public Health England as a
public health hazard.
In The New York Times, Pankaj Mishra, award-win-

the enduring rejection of common art, especially
in America. European artists and influential

Highbrow vs Lowbrow:
An Arbitrary Divide
There’s a hierarchy in the world of art.
Opera sits on a lofty perch, high above its
modern counterpart, musical theatre, fan-
ning itself with its 17th century orient-in-
spired decorative hand fan. And if opera is at the peak
of the pyramid and musical theatre its body, the un-
derbelly is a writhing mass of Disney movie musicals
like High School Musical and Frozen, feeding on the
rotting carcass of public appeal. A similar hierarchy
exists for books: books about straight, white Ameri-
can men trumping graphic novels and comic books.
Mention manga and the art world collectively shrugs
as if to say “Manga? I don’t know her.” Put
simply, Art is divided
into “highbrow”
and “lowbrow”
forms, the for-
mer a byword
for art that is
intellectually
stimulating and
boundary-pushing and the latter a
condemnation of art that appeals to
the masses.
The separation of art into
“good” and “bad” has
occurred through-
out history with
works judged
on mastery of
the craft, divine
talent, and, as is
always the case,
social curren- cy.
The ability to arouse feeling through
a sensual medium was seen as a gift,
whether it be divine or otherwise but
sometime in the 18th and 19th century,
with the post-Enlightenment fixation
on the measurable and the rational,
the way the arts were judged began
to change. The Age of Enlight-
enment ushered in an era of
hypothesis, reason, and experi-
mentation – what would grow
into what we call the scientific
method - and its effects trickled
through all layers of society and
culture. Royals and the clergy,
their status given by God and
conferred by blood, had their power and position
questioned and sometimes stripped away. Under this
new system, one would expect art to be released from
the shackles of class and pretension, and for all artistic
forms to thrive in a field levelled of its snobbery. After
all, how could you apply objective judgement to a sub-
jective medium like the arts? However, society abhors
a vacuum, and while paradigm shifts may change the
way the world is viewed, it rarely makes an impact
on the world itself. Those with the money and influ-
ence simply changed their vocabulary and were able
to re-establish their station – the poor were deemed
biologically degenerate and other races inferior with
prejudices now ‘scientifically’ supported by pseudosci-
ence such as the study of skull shapes or phrenology.
According to this particular branch of
pseudoscience, a high brow or forehead
signified intelligence and
an aptitude for the
sciences and art.
Unfortunate-
ly, anyone who
wasn’t basically a
Caucasian male,
was seen as having
a significantly low-
er forehead and
therefore lacked
the necessary de-
velopment to succeed in
these fields. It really goes
to show the lengths to
which white men would
go to justify their receding
hairlines.

Looks like I did Whistlers mother a favour. She is low brow now!
