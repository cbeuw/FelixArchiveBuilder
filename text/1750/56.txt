FELIX SEX SURVEY 2020
KINKS
SEX SONGS
Whether it be the founding of Kink Klub or the
noises coming from your flat mates room at 2
am, Imperial students are definitely kinky! Over
2% of male respondents included BDSM type
kinks in their bedroom routines. Females how-
ever seem even more interested in BDSM, being
about twice as likely to be excited by the chains
and whips than the males. A surprisingly small
minority of females included praise as one of
their kinks, which is unusual as most Imperial
students are still yearning for praise from their
parents.

ple listed The
