Earth.” stressed Dr Clements. “It’s also
way drier – 20 times drier than the Ata-
cama Desert, which is the driest place on
Earth, and water is by and large thought
to be an essential component for life to
operate.So–howdoes[anypossiblelife]
cope with that? We don’t know.”
“There is no reason to assume that
something that evolved separately on a
different body is going to use the same
biochemistry that we have – that it’s go-
ing to use DNA, RNA, the Krebs cycle
for metabolism... So that’s why it’s sur-
prising. We need to know whether that’s
the case, because if it does turn out to
have DNA then the chances are that life
evolved once in the Solar System and
spread to other planets through asteroid
impacts... But if it turns out to be a sepa-
rate origin of life,
then you’ve got
two planets, bang
next door to each
other, and life has
happened twice,
entirely inde-
pendently. What
does that say
about the distri-
bution of life in
the universe? It
means it’s going
to be really com-
mon.”
On the possi-
bility of there being a biological origin
forthephosphine,DrClementssaidthat
his co-author Dr William Bains “still
thinks there’s a 90% chance that this is
just chemistry that
we haven’t found –
some strange photo-
chemistry that the
weird environment
of Venus was able to
do.”
“Obviously, we
would all love for it
to be biological, but
if there’s a particular
result that you would
like to be the case,
you have to be that
result’s worst enemy.
That’s how responsi-
ble science is done. But I still really want
it to be life.”
So what next? The paper concludes
that next steps would be to conduct in
situ measurements or to do aerosol re-
turn, i.e. sending a probe to Venus to
study a sample. Mission concepts to visit
the Venusian clouds are being discussed
at NASA but space missions notoriously
take years to launch. However, Dr Mu-
eller-Wodarg remains optimistic: “Some-
times surprises happen, like the Venus
Express mission. It was developed over
the course of two years because it was
made from flight spares from several oth-
er missions, so a Venus mission is doable
over a shorter amount of time.”
He chuckled. “Maybe this is the clos-
est we’ll ever get to a Nobel Prize – how
about that?”

Trump treated with experimental
antibody cocktail
Donald Trump, adept science denier
and alternative facts authority, has
become an unwitting participant in the
scientific method.
After testing positive for COVID-19
on early Friday morning, President
Trump was flown to Walter Reed
National Military Medical Centre as a
“precautionary measure”. Disclosed in a
public memo, the President’s treatment
included the prescription of an 8g dose
of experimental polyclonal antibody
drug, REGN-COV2.
Developed by Regeneron Pharma-
ceuticals, REGN-COV2 is currently
undergoing clinical trials after showing
promising results in reducing levels of
viral particles and improving symptoms
in those infected. The drug combines
two potent monoclonal antibodies:
man-made proteins like those produced
naturally by the immune system that
bind to specific protein sites on vi-
ruses. As antibodies are so exactly
specified, any change to the pro-
tein through a viral mutation will
render the antibody ineffective.
This is called ‘viral escape’ and it is
this mechanism that REGN-COV2
acts against. The drug’s antibodies bind
to two distinct sites on the SARS-CoV2
spike protein – in turn meaning that
two simultaneous viral mutations of
the protein would be required for viral
escape. In this way, when the drug is
administered, the likelihood of
‘escape mutants’ and thus
the infectivity of the
virus is reduced.
While allergic
reactions to for-
eign antibodies are
typical of similar
treatments, any
potential side-ef-
fects of REGN-
COV2 are
yet to
be
confirmed.
It’s early days for this new drug, but
with $450 million to support clinical
development, signs of great promise in
pre-clinical trials, and the chance of a
ringing presidential endorsement, the
future looks hopeful for REGN-
COV2 and the patients it
could treat.
Editor’s note: Since this
article was written, the
President was discharged
from Walter Reed on
Monday.
Legacy system
causes 16,000
unreported
coronavirus cases
Over 16,000 coronavirus test cases
between September 25th and Oc-
tober 2nd went unreported due to the
Public Health England’s (PHE) use of a
13-year-old Microsoft Excel document
format (.xls) to store data.
This format, which dates back to
1987, has a fixed capacity of 65,536
rows, whereas the new one (.xlsx) re-
leased in 2007 supports up to 1,480,576
rows. Test results were initially popu-
lated in a CSV file (which has no fixed
size limit) and then automatically fed
into an Excel template file. During this
automated process, the number of rows
reached the maximum limit, leaving the
remaining data ignored. A temporary
fix to this problem has been issued,
which involves splitting up the data into
smaller batches, and several people are
calling for a replacement. However, it is
a source of national embarrassment that
such critical data, used by the NHS test
and trace system and the PHE reporting
dashboard, is managed through an Excel
spreadsheet.
