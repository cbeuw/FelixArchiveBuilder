RELATIONSHIPS @ IMPERIAL

Almost a quarter of Aero respondents claim to have had sex on
campus, the most out of all departments. This is nearly triple
the percentage of Materials respondents who have had campus
sex, which is the least out of all departments. There is no indi-
cation of how likely a department is to have had sex on campus.
Students in relationships at Imperial meet in various ways but
student halls really seems the place to find that special some-
one. Dating apps are by far the least likely way of finding a bae
with slightly more luck being afforded to LGBTQ+ respondents.
These same LGBTQ+ respondents were also much more likely
to meet at society events, maybe due to the success of IQ, the
Imperial Queer society, at fostering a sense of community.

66.30% of those currently in a relationship have
one with someone who is/was at Imperial
Dating within departments is clearly the pref-
erence amongst the student body with med-
ics having a particular interest in each
other over any other course. If you are
one of the 66.3% of people who have
you ever dated anyone at Imperial,
check to see if your pairing is a
popular one or you and your
partner explored new territo-
ry together.
Who’s dating who?
This graph shows the likelihood (not probability!) of inter-department dating. For
example, this box shows the likelihood of someone from Computing dating some-
one from Civ eng. The warmer the colour, the higher the likelihood.
