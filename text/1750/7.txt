Over 500,000 cases. More than
40,000 dead. The largest recession
on record. The UK’s response to the
coronavirus pandemic has left much
to be desired, and with the start of a
second wave already exceeding the
recorded case numbers of the first peak,
time is running out for the government
to act decisively with evidence-based
policies. How did the government get
this so wrong, and what, if anything, did
it get right?
In 2016, a secret government drill
called Exercise Cygnus was carried out
to test the pandemic preparedness of the
UK. Specifically, the virus it looked at
was influenza, not a coronavirus, howev-
er there were many similarities between
the simulated disease and COVID-19,
namely that they were both fast-spread-
ing acute respiratory diseases.
Cygnus told the Government some-
thing it did not want to hear: that the
UK was woefully unequipped to deal
with a pandemic. At a time of austerity,
simulations predicted the overwhelm-
ing of an underfunded NHS that was
lacking enough ICU beds and personal
protective equipment (PPE). However,
rather than act on the findings of this
drill, the report was buried on the basis
of national security.
Flash forward to 30th January 2020,
when the World Health Organisation
(WHO) announced to the world a
Public Health Emergency of Interna-
tional Concern occurring in Wuhan,
China. Despite the WHO warning
governments about the severity of this
issue, the current Prime Minister, Boris
Johnson, missed five consecutive emer-
gency COBRA meetings at the start of
the crisis; already putting the country’s
response on a weak footing.
On the 3rd March, more than a
month after the initial WHO warning,
the Government announced its plan to
“Contain, Delay, Research, and Mit-
igate”. By this time, the situation was
developing quickly in Italy, which was
deemed to be a ‘few weeks ahead’ in the
pandemic, and thus was hit particularly
severely. Italy entered a national lock-
down a week later on the 10th March,
with the crisis serving as a warning to
other countries, including the UK. Yet
the Government pursued a different
strategy, known infamously as the ‘herd
immunity’ strategy.
Revealed by the Government’s Chief
Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick
Vallance at a press conference
on 12th March, the public
was told that the Govern-
ment was not trying to
stop them from catching
the disease. “It’s not desir-
able, because you want to
get some immu-
nity in the
population”,
said Val-
lance. The
aim of this
strategy
was to
let the
virus
spread, allowing the surviving popu-
lation to build a degree of immunity
post-recovery, and putting an end to any
further COVID-19 transmission in the
UK. This would rely on the phenome-
non of herd immunity: when a critical
proportion (thought in this case to be
around 60%) of the population have
immunity to an infectious disease, it can
stop spreading. And yes – letting 60%
of people get infected is as crazy as it
sounds.
Why was the Government pursuing
a strategy of letting a deadly virus tear
the population, potentially causing the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of el-
derly and vulnerable people? It claimed
to be “following the science” – yet later
developments of premature reopenings
over the summer implied that their rea-
soning could be more ideological than
scientific.
Meanwhile, experts such as Richard
Horton, editor of prestigious medical
journal The Lancet, and Antho-
ny Costello, professor of
global health at UCL,
were urging the Gov-
ernment to act and
bring about tougher
measures to ‘flatten the
curve’. On
March 15th, the discrepancies between
the UK and European strategies were
also highlighted by then Leader of the
Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, to no avail.
On March 16th, Imperial College
modelling that showed the UK was on
track for 250,000 deaths was released
by Professor Neil Ferguson, one of the
epidemiologists sitting on the Scien-
tific Advisory Group for Emergencies
(SAGE). Modelling was also conducted
with an alternative strategy of inter-
mittent restrictions, showing a reduced
death toll of 20,000 – on the same order
of magnitude as our current death toll.
It was this modelling that, when pre-
sented to the Government, caused an
immediate change in strategy, with case
isolation and social distancing measures
introduced on the same day. Mass gath-
erings were also banned, but this was
too little, too late, and Johnson would
end up declaring a full-scale lockdown
merely seven days later.
How did we go from a full-scale
lockdown to a foreboding second wave?
All shall be answered next week, in the
second part.

TRIPPING AT THE
STARTING LINE
Editor’s Note
The public backlash to the herd
immunity strategy was inevitable,
however it was met with derision
from the liberal commentariat.
Bizarre tweets the day after the an-
nouncement, such as from former
Ed Miliband adviser and commen-
tator Ayesha Hazarika calling the
backlash “hipster analysis”, and
from BBC comedy show Have I
got News For You, mocking the
opinion of a man-made pandemic
expert ‘Dave from Wigan’, served
to tell the public one thing: shut
up and let the Government do
what it wants. Why did the media
discourage criticism of this Gov-
ernment at the height of a crisis?
