sive compact object at the centre of our
galaxy.”
Penrose’s work was theoretical, and it
set a generation of experimental astro-
physicists to work to find these myste-
rious black holes. Reinhard Genzel and
Andrea Ghez were two of those astro-
physicists, and they
have been awarded
the Prize for their
discovery of a super-
massive black hole
at the centre of the
Milky Way, known
as Sagittarius A*.
Since the early 1990s, Genzel and
Ghez have each led a group of astrono-
mers who have spent years working with
the world’s largest telescopes to map the
orbits of stars closest to the middle of
our galaxy. The orbits of these stars sug-
gest that there is an invisible mass at the
centre of the galaxy, four million times
heavier than our Sun. This provides
convincing evidence that a supermassive
black hole sits at the centre of the Milky
Way.
Additionally, Ghez is only the fourth
woman in history to be awarded the
Nobel Prize for Physics.
All three sci-
entists who were
awarded the prize
this year have
helped to prove
that there can be
no doubt about
the existence of the black hole. Their
case was further supported by the
successes of the scientists who cap-
tured the first image of a black hole
using the Event Horizon Telescope
last year – perhaps a future Nobel
contender?
In these uncertain times, when we
are over-
whelmed
every day
with alarm-
ing new
science, it
is nice to
be remind-
ed that sci-
ence can be
filled with
mystery,
wonder
and ex-
citement.
Today we
have Roger
Penrose,
Reinhard
Genzel and
Andrea
Ghez to
thank.

This Wednesday, the Nobel Com-
mittee announced that it had
decided to award the 2020 Nobel Prize
for Chemistry to Emmanuelle Char-
pentier and Jennifer A. Doudna “for the
development of a method for genome
editing”. This marks the first time in
history that two women have shared the
prize.
During her studies of a harmful
bacteria known as Streptococcus pyogenes,
which is responsible for infectious dis-
eases such as tonsillitis and scarlet fever,
Charpentier discovered that a previous-
ly unknown molecule called tracrRNA
was used in the bacteria’s own immune
system to disarm unknown viruses by
“cutting out” sections of their DNA.
Charpentier and Doudna then worked
together to recreate and simplify these
so-called “genetic scissors” in a test tube.
Finally, they reprogrammed the genetic
scissors so that they could be controlled
and used to cut out any DNA molecule,
not just those from viruses.
When these DNA molecules are
cut out, cells will try to fix the damage
caused, often disabling the gene in the
process. This allows harmful genes to
be “switched off”. Mutated DNA could
also be replaced with a healthy section
of DNA to combat genetic diseases.
Genome
editing has
become
something
of a contro-
versial topic
over the past
decade, with
many fearing
that it may
lead to the
creation of
“designer
babies”. Last
year, scientist
He Jiankui
was sentenced
to three years in prison for creating ge-
netically modified twin sisters using the
CRISPR-Cas9 procedure, in an attempt
to make them immune to HIV. Doudna
has herself expressed feelings of concern
about the use of the technology she has
developed, and, in a 2015 interview
with the New Yorker, even recounted
a dream in which she had to present
her work on genome editing to Adolf
Hitler.
This is not the only controversy that
surrounds Wednesday’s announcement.
The invention of the CRISPR technol-
ogy has been the centre of an ongoing
five-year long patent battle between the
groups led by Charpentier and Doudna,
and a group led by Feng Zhang who
published evidence that the CRISPR
system could be used as a genome editor
just 7 months after Charpentier and
Doudna. A team led by biochemist
Virginijus Siksnys also independently
developed CRISPR genome editing and
published their results around the same
time, and Siksnys was jointly awarded
the 2018 Kavli Prize with
Charpentier and Doudna.
Despite all this, the No-
bel Committee for Chem-
istry clearly felt that there
were just two scientists who
were responsible for the
discovery. Charpentier and
Doudna have pioneered
a new technology that
has already transformed
research in life sciences. The
potential applications of
the CRISPR-Cas9 “genetic
scissors” seem limitless,
from genetically engineered
plants to the development
of new cancer treatments. And as
Professor Göran K. Hansson, Secretary
General of the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences, noted at the start of the an-
nouncement, “it is important, and well
worth the extra effort, to keep awarding
the most important discoveries and cel-
ebrating scientific progress, even under
these difficult times”.
