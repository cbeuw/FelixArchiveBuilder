While the fight against COV-
ID-19 continues, this year’s
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
recognises the decisive contributions of
three scientists in identifying the hepati-
tis C virus.
Harvey J. Alter, Michael
Houghton and Charles M.
Rice have been joint-
ly awarded for their
seminal research that
led to the discovery
of the hepatitis C
virus. The virus,
as indicated in its
name, causes chronic
hepatitis, a scourge
across the globe that
precipitates cirrhosis
and liver cancer, and is
responsible for over one
million deaths annually.
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, is
chiefly caused by viral infections, the
two main types of which were previ-
ously known to be hepatitis A and B.
Between them, the blood-borne hepa-
titis B is significantly more dangerous,
remaining asymptomatic for many years
until serious complications arise.
In the 1970s, blood tests for hepatitis
B had reduced cases of transfusion-re-
lated chronic hepatitis. Despite this, the
significant number of remaining cases
caused concern for Harvey J. Alter and
colleagues working at the US National
Institute of Health, who suspected an
unknown infectious agent. Using chim-
panzees, the only viable host
besides humans, and
rigorous methodi-
cal investigation,
Alter demon-
strated the
transmission
of a charac-
teristically
viral agent,
distinct from
both hepatitis A
and B.
In the wake of
Alter’s research, great
efforts were made to
identify this mysterious agent, yet
the novel virus failed to be identified
for over a decade. Researchers at phar-
maceutical company Chiron predicted
that a small fraction of the nucleic acids
present in the blood of infected chim-
panzees would be derived from the vi-
rus, and so set to work collecting DNA
fragments. Then, using sera taken from
hepatitis patients
containing the an-
tibodies against the
virus, Houghton and
colleagues were able
to identify cloned
DNA fragments
encoding viral pro-
teins from the elusive
infectious agent. Fur-
ther research showed
that this belonged to
a novel RNA virus
from the Flavivirus
family and it was
named hepatitis C.
The last step was
to determine wheth-
er the hepatitis C
virus alone could
cause hepatitis. Scientists set about in-
vestigating the virus’s ability to replicate
and cause disease. By observing genetic
variants in hepatitis C samples, Rice and
colleagues at Washington State Univer-
sity noted a region on the viral genome
that they suspected was important in
virus replication. Acting on this hypoth-
esis, Rice engineered a special RNA var-
iant of hepatitis C devoid of potentially
deactivating genetic variations. When
the RNA was injected into chimpan-
zee livers, Rice
observed patho-
logical changes
symptomatic
of the chronic
disease caused by
hepatitis C. This
acted as the proof
that hepatitis C
caused the unex-
plained cases of
transfusion-trans-
mitted hepatitis,
finally concluding
the decades-long
journey of scientif-
ic endeavour.
The discoveries
of this year’s three
Nobel Laureates
have revolutionised the fight against
hepatitis across the globe. Highly
sensitive blood tests can now mitigate
the risk of transfusion transmission
and effective anti-viral drugs have been
developed.
While hepatitis C remains a global
health concern, thanks to the work of
these scientists, work towards eliminat-
ing the disease is now possible.

Over the course of three days this week, the 2020 Nobel Prizes for science were announced online. Felix reports on the researchers
deemed worthy of the most prestigious prize in science, and why their work was so significant.

The announcement of the 2020
Nobel Prize for Physics was quieter
than most years, without the back-
ground noise of cameras clicking and
mumbles from a room packed with jour-
nalists. Professor Göran K. Hansson,
Secretary General of the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences, opened the an-
nouncement with an acknowledgement
of the strange times we are living in and
an apology to those journalists who had
not been able to attend in person.
But this did not take away from the
astonishing achievements of this year’s
recipients. The Nobel Prize for Physics
was awarded jointly this year, with one
half going to Sir Roger Penrose “for the
discovery that black hole formation is a
robust prediction of the general theo-
ry of relativity” and the other shared

Ghez “for the discovery of a supermas-
