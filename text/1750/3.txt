Hundreds of academics and re-
searchers at Imperial College
London have signed an open letter ad-
dressed to the College’s senior leader-
ship team calling for the repealing of
a new application fee for taught post-
graduate courses. Signatories accuse
the College of “financial gatekeeping”
and claim that the introduction of the
£80 fee will “act as a direct barrier for
underprivileged students”. The move
comes just weeks after the University
of Oxford resolved to scrap their post-
graduate application fees, which had
been in place since 2007, with the con-
gregation there specifically citing “the
undermining of diversity efforts” and
“discrimination”.
Many are surprised by the timing
of the decision, especially given Im-
perial’s specific context. According to
the most recent Times Good Univer-
sity Guide, Imperial ranks 5th lowest
in the country for social inclusion,
with a particularly low percentage of
state-school-educated students. The
introduction of the fee puts Imperi-
al squarely in the minority of Russell
Group institutions – although such
fees are more common in London. The
open letter also stresses that the deci-
sion is “important to consider in light
of the recent work by the college to im-
prove equality, specifically in response
to the #BlackLivesMatter movement”,
noting the “co-correlation of socio-
economic class
and ethnicity,
and associat-
ed disadvan-
tage”.
In an inter-
view with Fe-
lix earlier this
week, Profs
Ian Walmsley
and Emma
McCoy of the
senior leadership team explained the
reasoning behind the implementation
of the fee, saying that “appropriate”
management of postgraduate appli-
cations is a “considerable cost”. They
maintain that the measure won’t dis-
courage anyone from applying, with
Prof Walmsley saying that “we have
funds which we can use as waivers if
people aren’t able to cover the fee.

McCoy

ed that
funding
availabil-
ity should
stretch to
any appli-
cant “who
meets our
criteria for hardship. I don’t think this
is about the College profiteering”.
Some members of academic staff
disagree. Dr Dave Clements, depu-
ty director of Physics MSc programs,
shared his “distress” over the decision.
“This will be a heavy burden for disad-
vantaged students. Even with waivers,
these students will still be disadvan-
taged – they will have to go through
the extra process of applying, which
will further delay their application,
and they could miss
their place on high de-
mand courses”. One of
the authors of the open
letter, Dr Ben Britton,
expressed surprise over
the timing of the move,
particularly in light of
the University of Ox-
ford’s recent resolution
to abolish their fee and
the COVID-19 pan-
demic, saying “COVID restricts access
to universities… When there is an im-
minent recession, education is turned
to, and immediately we’re putting up
a financial barrier to people even ap-
plying”.
Prof Chris Jackson, another of the
authors, described what he thought
the two-fold impact may be: “One part
of it is inward-looking; I think a lot of
staff and students will find it hard to
trust Imperial when they make state-
ments about BLM, or widening partic-
ipation. And another part is to do with
the external reputation, and impact
on people applying”. He added that
the College may miss out on “huge
amounts of intellect and character”
from dissuaded applicants.
It’s not just staff who oppose the
measure: along with the academic sig-
natories of the open letter are many
students and alumni. Among them is
Ben Fernando, who led the successful
campaign at Oxford earlier this year
and has organised a petition for Impe-
rial alumni to voice opposition to the
College’s move. He said “it’s incredi-
bly sad that Imperial have taken this
decision at a time when we should be
reaffirming our commitment to equal-
ity and inclusion within the college. I
hope fellow alumni will stand together
on this issue and make clear that it’s
not OK.”
The move has also called into ques-
tion the transparency of the College’s
decision-making processes. Dr Brit-
ton says that he first heard about the
fee in a tweet of a colleague mere days
before its introduction, and Prof Jack-
son recalls speaking to “passionate
people at Imperial [involved in] wid-
ening participation” who were “com-
pletely blindsided” by the decision: “it
clearly hadn’t been discussed as widely
as it should have been”. The final de-
cision was made at President’s Board,
for which minutes are not made read-
ily available and whose process is de-
scribed as “opaque”.
The College hopes to prove these
fears unfounded, with the official web-
site promising that the waiver applica-
tion process will be “swift and simple”
and a pledging that it will “monitor the
impact closely over the coming year”.
