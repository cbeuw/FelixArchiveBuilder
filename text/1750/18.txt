LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Dear sir,
I am writing to you to inform you that there was
a mistake in your last issue. In the issue (1749)
you published, on page 18, column 3 line words
6-7, the words Union Jack. As an educated man
you must surely know that the words Union Jack
can only ever apply to a flag flown from a ship.
The word Jack refers to how the flag was flown
from the front of a warship and should not be
used to refer to the Union FLAG, in any other
context. Please let me know when the retraction
and apology have been published.

Dear sir,
I am writing to complain about a recent shipment
of yours. I definitely did not intend to order 400
bags of your Felix Finest Delicate meats cat food,
yet this was what appeared on my doorstep this
morning. On top of that, from what I have seen,
the first 200 appear to be mostly air with hardly
any delicate meat inside! You should be ashamed.

Dear sir,
I would like to apply to become your webmaster
(my CV is attached below). I believe that with
some minor changes we can make Felix Git com-
patible allowing us to roll back any errors in the
paper. This would also allow us to become more
sustainable by rolling back Felix into its constit-
uent ink and wood pulp components every week.
Let me know what you think.
