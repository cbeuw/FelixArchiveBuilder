Two weeks ago, after a
summer of preparation
I experienced the
greatest failure of
my life. Despite
my preparations,
I failed to get the
Felix pages to the
printers in time and
we were unable to print
that week. This did not in
the long term mean a lot. We had
left a buffer week between our first
issue and the second for precisely this
kind of eventuality but it was shock-
ing none the less. I left the office that
night lower than I believe I have ever
felt. I tied my self worth to that paper
and when it did not arrive I saw that
as my own total failure. It is easy to
give excuses for the lateness and if
you find me in the bar I will go into
detail as to why it was not at all my
fault and that if anything I should be
praised for what I had done.
But I did fail. And when the
pages didn’t arrive on Fri-
day it hurt all over again.
This week I write to
you, hopeful that what
happened last week
will never happen
again. We all got up and
got back to work.
I am incredibly proud of
the team. I would like to men-
tion the Science section in particular
this week. They have really taken my
request to put multiple articles on
a page and if you have a look today
I hope you will agree that the pages
look better for it.
When the papers did arrive the
following Wednesday, the rush that
I got made the whole summer of
toil and frustration worth it. We,
the Felix team had made something,
a huge, beautiful paper. We look
forward to continuing to do so as the
year goes on.

The trials of long distance
and the feeling of failure
The Felix Editor on
Union council oversteps
itself
I condemn, most strongly, the ac-
tions by the Union Council in chang-
ing the name of the De la Beche soci-
ety. I have no issue with the changing
of the name itself, I believe a culture
reckonning is upon us and Britain
must reap what it has sown.
When we as a nation failed to make
members of the Windrush genera-
tion feel welcome and forbade them
from integrating, how can anyone
expect them to value and want to
uphold the status quo when it so
completely failed them.
However, the actions of the Council
are not appropriate by any measure.
When a significant portion of the
voters check the Re Open Nomina-
tions, there is clearly a need for fur-
ther dialogue within the department
and the society.
Why have members not accepted the
name change? Do they have valid
concerns?
This did not occur, however. On the
basis of 62% of the vote in an elec-
tion that achieved a 22% turn out, it
was felt that a ‘majority of students’
had shown their support from the
name change.
I call on the members of the Union
Council to take their positions more
seriously or else they will become a
rubber stamping body. Last year, the
only bills brought to Council were
by Officer trustees and the Council
Chair. Let us hope that this sad state
of affairs does not continue.

Statement
of Intent
We here at Felix believe that it is al-
ways in the interests of the students to
know. That cover-up and paternalistic
obfuscation is never right and that
as intelligent people students should
be treated with respect and given the
ability to make up their own minds.
Therefore, I, the Felix Editor, on be-
half of the team promise that:
We will to the best of our abil-
ity tell you the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
We will keep your confidence
and will only publish something
you say to us if you have explicitly
said that we can.
We will work to expose unfair-
ness and discrimination in all
forms that it takes both at the
College and elsewhere.
We will treat fairly any article
sent to us, regardless of point
of view and do our best to work
with you to prepare it for publi-
cation it in our pages.
