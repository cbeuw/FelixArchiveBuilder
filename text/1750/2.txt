calibre that you would expect for any
Imperial programme”.
Students complaining that their fees
are being spent on a ‘streaming sub-
scription’ will be dis-
appointed to hear that
the College has no
plan to offer reduc-
tions in tuition fees.
The interim VP
(Education), a sta-
tistics lecturer, ex-
plained that in the
past the College
had been ‘outdat-
ed’, by being over-
ly focused on lec-
ture-based teaching
and that the COV-
ID enforced change
was merely “an ac-
celeration” of a trend that was already
occurring.
She pointed out that given much of
the information conveyed to students
over the course of a degree was availa-
ble on the internet it was more impor-
tant that academics worked with stu-
dents to help them learn to apply their
new knowledge.
When pressed on how distance, mul-
ti-mode, learning would teach students
the same practical skills that in person
teaching would, she gave the examples
of the Lab in a Box
parcels and having
students wear cam-
eras during practi-
cals.
The Lab in a
Box parcels have
been mailed to stu-
dents unable attend
in-person practicals
and contain equip-
ment intended to
allow students to
simulate some parts
of a practical exper-
iment in order to
gain vital skills.
McCoy insisted that all learning ob-
jectives would be met despite these
changes as a result of the major invest-
ments that had been made over the
summer.
While some departments have told
students that they must return to cam-
pus in January, others intend to offer
fully online courses beyond that.

Union council push through
vote to change De la Beche
Society name
The Union council voted to change
the name of the former De la Beche
Society to the Geology Society. Union
trustee, Chris Carter brought a paper
to the Union Council meeting on 22nd
September which asked for the Council
to change the name of the society.
The members of the society had al-
ready voted previously on a name change
but there was no concessus reached on
what the name would be with the most
popular option (Geology society) only
gaining 62% of the votes, several below
the supermajority of 66% required by the
constitution to change the name.
Carter brought the paper to Council
because he felt with the full support of
his successor as RSMU President, the
current and former Geology Society
President’s and committees, members of
the Union Leadership team and mem-
bers of staff in the Department of Earth
Science and Engineering that it would
be better to go to Council rather than
rerunning the vote.
A sabbatical officer, when asked if they
felt that this was an appropriate use of
Council powers agreed that there was
little precedent for the action but said
“Who is going to defend a slaver?”
The name change was originally pro-
posed in response to De la Beche’s links
to prospecting and slavery in Africa.
