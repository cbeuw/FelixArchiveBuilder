People who identify as asexual
and experiences little to no sexual
attraction are the most likely to be
satisfied with being single and yet
the least satisfied with being in a
relationship. This is probably down
to their partner not being asexual
and thus a huge dilemma occurring
when it comes to having sex. Despite
damaging stereotypes about bi and
pan people being dissatisfied and
disloyal, they were in fact by far the
most satisfied with being in a rela-
tionship, around twice as much as
the breeders. Overall, there was not
much difference between heterosex-
uals and homosexuals when it came
to these categories of satisfaction.
DesEng and ChemEng are the two extremes when it comes to infidelity in relation-
ships. ChemEng are the most likely to be cheated on while they themselves are also
the least likely to cheat! DesEng on the other hand are the least likely to have been
cheated on and second only to CivEng when it comes to being loyal to a partner.
The age old question of what counts as cheating was posed
to the student body. Unsurprisingly, people who had cheated
before where a little more relaxed with the rules. The biggest
disagreement between the cheaters and the non-cheaters is
was when it comes to flirting with someone with cheaters less

for using data apps, sexting someone else and even sex which
amazingly is seen as some as not being a form of cheating.
