Average attractiveness
(Imperial scale)
When asked to rate their own attractiveness compared to the
general public and the rest of Imperial, people were more likely
to think they were pretty hot compared to their fellow sweaty stu-
dents in Metric on a Wednesday night, but not as much when rub-
bing shoulders with the wider London population at Ministry on a
Tuesday. Non virgins, differed a bit from this and thought the com-
petition at Imperial of whoâ€™s hot or not was actually higher than in
the greater population. The people having the most sex out there
also thought of themselves as being the most attractive, a clear
link between sexual confidence and self-esteem can be seen.
Yellow = non-virgins
Green = virgins
More red = more sex
More orange = less sex
