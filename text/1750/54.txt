By a slim majority, the preference of Imperial stu-
dents is to never get an STI test. Despite the stereo-
type, this is not because the majority are not having
sex which means a large percentage of people are
having frequent sex without getting a test. There is
still a lot of shame surrounding STIs which may ex-
plain this figure but as most of these infections are
easily curable and not serious unless left undetected,
it makes sense for everyone to get tested.
Reading about sexual harassment in the news over the last few
years has been shocking for many but even more shocking is that
this isnâ€™t just happening to people in the entertainment industry but
also to students attending Imperial. Two out of every 15 females
has been sexual harassed once, with one of those saying it has
happened multiple times. Males are much less likely to be sexually
harassed, around 5 times less. Despite a low number of non-binary
respondents, one shocking result was that all the non-binary people
who had been sexually harassed reported it happening multiple
times.
There was general
agreement across differ-
ent demographics about
the types of actions which
qualify as sexual harass-
ment. It is possible that
more discrepancies could
be found, for example be-
tween male and female
respondents, had more
subtle forms of sexual har-
assment, such as catcall-
ing and unwelcome com-
pliments from colleagues,
been included
51.45% of respondents have never been tested for STIs
19.88% of respondents have been tested in the last 6 months
14.82% of respondents have been tested in the last 12 months
13.85% of respondents mostly recently tested over 12 months ago
Getting tested has never
been easier with Sexual
Health London offering
free, discreet and con-
venient home testing kits
(before Covid made it
cool) for a wide range of
STIs. Check out www.shl.
uk for more.
Chlamydia seems to be
the most common STI to
be tested for, almost dou-
ble than for other diseas-
es like HPV, Hepatitis and
Herpes.
