New NHS contact tracing app released
- a hopeful second attempt
After a partially failed first attempt
back in June, the second NHS
COVID-19 contact tracing app, re-
leased on 24th September, has garnered
over 10 million downloads.
An automated contact tracing app pe-
riodically monitors and registers a user’s
contact with another individual (either
known or unknown) by broadcasting
and receiving a key code composed
of a random set of characters through
Bluetooth Low Energy. This key code
is changed regularly to maintain the
anonymity of the user, and a list of past
key codes is stored locally. Additionally,
an encounter list tracks the codes of
registered contacts. Users can log their
COVID-19 test results in the app, and
if the result indicates a positive, then
an alert is generated for those on the
encounter list, who are then instructed
to self-isolate to limit transmission.
The new NHS app takes a decentral-
ised approach and uses the Exposure
Notification API, a toolkit collabora-
tively developed by Apple and Google.
This approach aims to prioritise
user privacy and anonymity
by processing user in-
formation locally
to generate
exposure
alerts.
In con-
trast, the first
attempt took
a centralised ap-
proach where user
data is uploaded to
and processed by a cen-
tral NHS server. While
this allows the NHS to
accumulate a rich dataset
that could be analysed by ep-
idemiologists, privacy concerns
and security vulnerabilities were
felt to outweigh the benefits. Inter-
estingly, the first app has been shown
to work on a greater number of older
devices and is more accurate in measur-
ing the contact distance. However, the
app was forced to circumvent Apple’s
privacy measures to avoid background
Bluetooth activity, but even this custom
solution had a few bugs. Considering
Apple’s strict App Store policies,
this app was at a high risk of being
rejected for publication regard-
less, so the UK government set
to work on the development
of the second application
in parallel that used
the Apple-Google
toolkit.
Accuracy
while respect-
ing privacy
is the main
aim of
decen-
tralised
contact
trac-
ing apps.
However, recent
reports have shown the
app to sacrifice the accura-
cy aspect with false readings of close
contact and disappearing exposure
notifications caused by bugs in the Ap-
ple-Google API.
The effectiveness of this second appli-
cation in slowing the pace of the virus is
yet to become clear. Experts have mixed
opinions on how automated contact
tracing can help reduce transmission.
For example, a study from Oxford
indicates that even low levels of app
adoption would help save lives, whereas
one from UCL found that large scale
adoption of the app and integration
with a public health response is crucial
for any significant impact. However,
both studies agree that automated
contact tracing can indeed complement
manual contact tracing.
Despite an unsuccessful first at
tempt, it is commendable that the NHS
immediately began work on a second
app in parallel with instead of in oppo-
sition to technology giants. If it were
the latter, it could’ve potentially led to
a much worse situation. With COV-
ID-19 cases on the rise in the UK we
can only hope that this new app will
make a significant difference.
In order to put an end to the glob-
al coronavirus pandemic, researchers
around the world are working tire-
lessly to develop a vaccine to protect
against COVID-19. While vaccine
production usually takes multiple
years, a coronavirus vaccine is hoped
tobedevelopedwithin12-18months.
Vaccine testing can be split into 5
stages:
Pre-clinical – animal testing to see
whether the vaccine elicits an immune
response.
Phase I – healthy human volunteers
to determine safety and evaluate im-
mune response.
Phase II – hundreds of volunteers to
identify correct dosage.
Phase III – thousands of volunteers
to confirm safety and efficacy vs. a
placebo.
PhaseIV–studiesonadverseeffects,
long-termmmunityandvaccineusage
following the approval and licensing
of the vaccine.
The WHO is currently tracking the
progress of over 170 candidate vac-
cines; at Felix, we’ve chosen 5 of the
most promising candidates to follow,
so watch this space!
New Update: Last week, new results
of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine clin-
ical trial were published in Nature,
showing that the vaccine can induce a
robust immune response.
