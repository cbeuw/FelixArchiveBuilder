Since Covid first made its appear-
ance earlier in 2020, most of us
have seen far fewer people than we’re
used to. Families have been at home for
months. If you’re a student, you may
have been in your dorm room with your
mates.
But as humans, we’re sociable crea-
tures. Even introverts need some social-
isation, and many of us are desperate to
get out of the house and do something
(anything) with friends. If you’re won-
dering what activity would be fun, chal-
lenging, and socially distanced enough
to be safe, why not try golf? Here’s why
it would be a great way for students to
socialise in the time of Covid.
If you’re an avid golfer, you may have
been playing at home or in your dorm
room throughout lockdown. But if you
think about it, golf is the perfect social
distancing sport. There’s no high-fiving
and bum-slapping like there is in other
sports. It’s known as the gentlemen’s
game (or gentlewomen’s) and it’s much
more chilled with the physical contact.
That’s not to say there are no happy
congratulations when one of you sinks
a tough putt or gets an elusive hole-in-
one. They’re just more
like an appreciative
nod than a raucous
team hug.
Golf is a leisurely
sport that promotes
health and fitness,
gets you out in the
fresh air, and allows
you to do some-
thing enjoyable
with a group of peo-
ple whose company you like. To add to
that, the relaxed nature of golf makes it
one of the best sports to do with a mask
on, if you feel the need for an extra layer
of protection.
Despite the fact that golf is a one-
man game, it’s still a team sport in other
ways. If you have a caddy, there’s already
a loyal partner in your game. If not,
you’ll still be walking the course with
some good friends. Some competition
is part of the experience, but if you’re
playing a friendly game, you’ll most
likely be cheering each other on rather
than plotting to
throw your bes-
tie’s game off.
Then there’s the
19th hole - the
chance to catch
up afterwards and
chat about the
game,theday,and
whatever else you
didn’t get round
to talking about
on the course. The 19th hole doesn’t
have to be in a bar or restaurant, either.
If you can’t have a pint in the clubhouse
after a game due to Covid restrictions,
you can have a Coke and a sandwich on
a picnic blanket or someone’s tailgate
before heading home.
Are you a beginner who still needs
to learn the difference between a driver
and a putter? Don’t let that put you off
getting out on the golf course. Here’s
another perfect opportunity to social-
ise - learn from someone whose skill
level is greater than yours. If you’re an
advanced player, why not teach one
of your friends the ins and outs of the
game? Golf doesn’t only have to be a so-
cialising opportunity for those who’ve
played before or have similar abilities.
Why not get a bunch of friends togeth-
er and learn or teach your way through
a game? It’s still getting out in the fresh
air, doing some exercise, and getting
some valuable social time together.
Golf is a super way for students to get
out of their dorm room and socialise
with some friends they haven’t seen in
a while. It’s the perfect social distancing
sport, while improving health, keeping
the brain sharp, and being just good fun
all at the same time.
