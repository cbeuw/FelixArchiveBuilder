Over the course of my investiga-
tion, I spoke to to a fresher who
is just about to move into Wil-
son hall at Imperial and a slight
optimism with a heavy serving of
glumness was clear:
“I’m trying to keep an optimis-
tic mindset about socialising be-
cause there are online events and
the possibility to still hang out in
small groups, but the situation
in Scotland makes it feel like the
ability to socialise will proba-
bly disappear very quickly after
move-in. I’m also worried about
the mental health implications a
potential lockdown in halls could
have, how that could impact my
studies, work ability, and overall
university experience”
A student who was meant to come to cam-
pus has decided to attend the first term re-
motely
“I decided studying in Portugal until Jan-
uary would be the best option because this
would allow me to be home if there was a
second massive outbreak. Right now what
I am most worried about is the fact that
there will still be some practicals, and even
though the university has assured online
students that this will have no impact or af-
fect us in any way I am slightly concerned
that I will be disadvantaged. On a more so-
cial side I am also a bit worried that when I
get there in January there are already some
groups formed and everyone already knows
each other quite well and that this will make
my integration in the university harder, as
in October I would be in the same uncom-
fortable situation as everyone else.”
Two sides of the coin
bring them and being able to have some
freedom back. “Students kind of need
a light at the end of the tunnel in order
for them to sort of maintain their mo-
rale.”
New students have been moving into
halls over the last two weeks, and al-
though many of them and the College
as well have taken extraordinary cov-
id measures, Dan believes this is not
enough.
Most of the measures employed by
thetwouniversitiesareverysimilarwith
Imperial seemingly going a step further
by treating self isolating students with
more precautions by moving them to
en-suite rooms and not letting them
out under any circumstances. However,
there doesn’t seem to be much in terms
of provisions for food, laundry cleaning
or access to wellness activities. Being
cooped up in a room for 14 days can
definitely take a toll on the freshers.
Without putting in proper measures,
the risk of students not following the
proper channels and taking the self iso-
lation into their own hands is very pos-
sible.
A former Woodward resident who
also went on to be a hall senior at Pem-
bridge said the following “Whether it
be the Woodward lifts shared by hun-
dreds of students or the Wilson house
narrow interminable hallway, or the
kitchen shared by over 20 people in
Pembridge, there is no way infections
won’t spread like wildfire if Imperial
doesn’t put further measures in place.”
After a lot of media coverage and
controversy, Glasgow eventually agreed
to refund 4 weeks rent to students self
isolating and give them a bit of mon-
ey to spend on food delivery, Imperial
hasn’t made the same commitment but
a similar controversy could push the
same thing to happen.
Former Union President and anti-lockdown
campaigner Piers Corbyn comes to Imperial
Calum Drysdale Editor in Chief
On Wednesday 7th
October,
former Union President Piers
Corby, brother of former Leader of
the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn and
anti-lockdown protestor attended
Imperial on the invitation of a stu-
dent to hold a rally accusing Imperial
academics of being in the pay of Bill
Gates and working to establish a ‘new
normal’ and a ‘new world order’.
Invited by Marwan Riach, himself a
stauch anti-second lockdown advo-
cate he took the opportunity to look
around the Union and reminiss over
his experiences at the time. College,
Union and students were, howev-
er, united in opposition to his visit.
College security were in large attend-
ance with security and police officers
together outnumbering the small
number of protestors.
Corbyn gave a speech on Queen’s
lawn in front of a banner calling on
the government to take down 5G
masts, end mask wearing and social
distancing and halt any work on
vaccine development. Mr Corbyn
studied physics when he attended
Imperial College.
In an interview Corbyn explained
that the dictatorial style of govern-
ment that Britain was currently
experiencing was intended to weaken
our immune systems by limiting so-
cial contact to make us vulnerable to
other attacks and population control
measures. He quoted Orwell a num-
ber of times asking students sitting
on Queen’s lawn to consider whether
they could ever have tolerated the
restrictions put on them a year ago.
When Mr Corbyn went to the
Union to try to get a drink he was
blocked by members of Union secu-
rity that shut all the doors and barred
him entry.
There was also a confrontation be-
tween students in the
quad and Corbyn and
his fellow anti-lock-
down protestors.
One student, Pierre
Vivier, a 3rd year
Maths student said
that it was outrageous
that College and Union
security had allowed
Corbyn onto College
grounds. “What if
there was someone
with asthma?” he
asked.
The group of pro-
testers left Beit and
dispersed after this.
They handed out flyers
as they left advertis-
ing a “Drink against
the Lockdown” to be
held at 10pm on Old
Compton road.
