T
he Proms
concerts are an
annual tradition
dating back to the
late 1800s, when open-air
‘promenade concerts’
had become popular in
London’s pleasure gar-
dens. Rather than sitting
stiffly down to listen
to music, concertgoers
would stroll, or prome-
nade, through the gardens
while enjoying fresh air
and the outdoors.
Back then classical
music had a bit of a
reputation for stuffiness
and inaccessibility that
still dogs the genre even
today. Robert Newman,
the then-manager of the
Queen’s Hall, had the
bright idea of offering
indoor promenade tickets
to the public, advertising
low ticket prices and an
informal atmosphere
where eating, drinking
and smoking would be
permitted during the
concert.
Much has changed
since the inaugural Proms
concert in 1985. The
original Queen’s Hall
was destroyed during the
London Blitz in 1941,
with the Royal Albert
Hall having served as
the venue for the Proms
ever since. The BBC took
over organisation and
direction of the Proms
after Newman’s death in
1927, adding new inno-
vations such as lunchtime
chamber concerts, Proms
in the Park, and live broad-
casting of every concert.
And while the informal
atmosphere remains,
smoking is of course no
longer permitted during
the concerts!
So how does one join
the ranks of ‘Prommers’?
The Proms run every
year in summer from the
second weekend of July
to the second weekend
of September. Over 1000
promming spaces are
available for each concert
and cannot be pre-booked,
meaning that promming is
an excellent (and cheap)
way to get tickets to
concerts which are other-
wise sold out.
Traditionally, the done
thing is to queue for
tickets outside the Royal
Albert Hall on the day
itself. The £6 promming
tickets are given out from
2 hours before the start of
a performance, although
keen concertgoers may
start queueing much
earlier. Perhaps to save
people from dessicating
in the heatwave, this year
‘skip the queue’ number
coupons were also given
out from 9am on the
morning of the concert
itself. This essentially
holds your place in the
queue for later on in the
evening; you just turn up
with your queue number
and shove your way in
front of everyone else
who has a queue number
after yours. Worth it if
only for the resultant
feeling of smugness. For
those who would prefer to
avoid social interaction al-
together, a limited number
of online tickets are also
available from 9am on the
day of the performance,
with an additional £1.12
booking fee.
Regardless of how
you get your tickets, the
scene when you actually
arrive outside the Royal
Albert Hall is usually one
of organised chaos. Lots
of different queues at dif-
ferent doors (day tickets,
pre-purchased, gallery /
arena, season passes…)
and everyone apart from
you seems to know where
they’re supposed to be
standing. Personally, I
couldn’t figure out the
logic of the queues even
after my seventh time
going, so it’s best to ask
one of the stewards rather
than standing in the wrong
line for half an hour.
There are two areas
reserved for promming
at the Royal Albert Hall:
the arena, on the ground
floor right in front of the
orchestra, and the gallery,
located up in the gods
near the ceiling of the
concert hall. Which is
better? Each has its own
charms – the arena has
indubitably better sound
quality, but is rather
more formal. Expect to
stand for the entirety of
the evening; even if you
try to sit down, ushers
will come by and chivvy
you to stand up so that
more people can fit in at
the back. In contrast, the
gallery is very far from
the orchestra and sound
can be a bit muffled, but
it commands an excellent
view of the stage. The
gallery is also much less
formal – people bring
cushions, picnic mats and
even inflatable mattresses
to lie on. Anything goes
really as long as you
don’t disturb your fellow
concert-goers by eating
crisps noisily during the
wild melodrama of ‘Night
on the Bare Mountain’ (as
happened to yours truly).
Whether at the arena or
gallery, there is no dress
code for proms – wear
whatever you like!
What can one expect
out of a night at the
Proms? Despite its evo-
lution over the years, the
main aim of the Proms is
still to make world-class
classical music accessi-
ble to all. Each night’s
programme is often
thematically arranged,
with pre-show talks held
at Imperial’s very own
Union Bar. Expect the
usual popular repertoire
but also contemporary
composers and less-
known works, a practice
which dates back to when
Sir Henry Wood conduct-
ed the Proms in the early
1900s. While the BBC
Symphony Orchestra is
the main orchestra, a wide
variety of world-famous
guest orchestras, soloists
and conductors make
their way through the
Royal Albert Hall for each
year’s Proms. Highlights
from this year include the
Berlin Philharmonic con-
ducted by Kirill Petrenko,
and Seong-Jin Cho
playing Chopin’s Second
Piano Concerto.
Finally, the Last Night
of the Proms is always
a boisterous and wildly
popular affair. It’s been
described as “classical
music’s biggest party”.
The atmosphere is festive;
balloons and party
poppers abound, as does
much enthusiastic waving
of Union Jacks. Regular
tickets for the Last Night
are allocated by ballot,
while only prommers who
have gone for 5 or more
shows in the season are
able to get £6 promming
tickets for the Last Night.
Usually a combination of
crowd-pleasing classics
and British patriotic
pieces, it’s always a night
not to be missed.
An evening at the
Proms is a magical expe-
rience. Bring that special
someone – or meet them
in the ticket queue! This
year’s season is sadly
over, but it’s definitely
something to look out for
come next July.
