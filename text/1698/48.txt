S
port has been for
myself, and many
of my friends, an
integral part of
university life. Being at
university can be stressful
not only because of aca-
demic pressure, but also
because of moving away
from home, dealing with
finances, making new
friends and stresses from
home, as well as being
pushed outside of your
comfort zone daily. Sports
can help to alleviate this
stress as well as give you
a sense of belonging and
achievement. Different
sports offer different
positives at different
commitment levels and
“...‘Give it a Go’
sessions... are
put on by clubs
to give a taste
of what the
club can offer.”

at Imperial there is a
huge range available to
get involved in (over 60
clubs), from more tradi-
tional rugby, netball and
athletics to some you may
timed stops at each sport
club stall. Implementation
of finance algorithms
within Excel is necessary
to ensure that your budget
can withstand sport’s
membership, match fees,
tour, networking events,
transportation, and per-
sonalised garments.
In honesty, my advice is
to enjoy freshers week but
do try to take advantage of
the opportunities availa-
ble around freshers’ week.
Personally, I fumbled a
through my first week in
a drunken stupor, missing
my American Football’s
(my chosen sport until
injury forced me to quit)
trial sessions. I regret not
making more time for
“give it a go” sessions,
which are put on by clubs
to give a taste of what the
club can offer. I encour-
age you to try as many
as possible. Imperial has
such a vast range of sports
that I had never heard of
prior to university. I’ve
tried American football,
ultimate frisbee, futsal,
underwater hockey,
lacrosse and mountaineer-
ing to name a few, all of
which have been very en-
joyable, and everyone was
very welcoming. Many
recruits only pick up their
sport in university. You’ll
be sure to find the sport
right for you.
As there are many
different sports there are
many venues too. Training
occurs across west (near
Heathrow) to more central
London. With most sports
that are played on grass or
3G, training is at Harling-
ton or Heston. It is worth
noting that trips to-and-
from Harlington are about
2-3 hour round trip via
public transport from the
main campus. The cost in
time and money is sub-
the cost. Indoor sports are
mostly played at Ethos,
Imperial’s sports hub, and
rowing takes place at Im-
perial’s own boathouse in
Putney. Training sessions
can also take place in local
parks (such as Hyde Park
and Lillie Park), Union
rooms, and non-imperial
gyms. Imperial has two
gyms, one in Ethos and
one in Reynolds building,
both with strength condi-
tioning rooms that often
hold sessions for sport’s
teams with qualified
coaches. Sports teams are
also split broadly between
IC (Imperial College) and
ICSM (Imperial College
School of Medicine).
Pick your allegiances
as you wish. The main
difference is the location
of sport’s nights, IC being
at the Union and ICSM at
Reynolds.
If you have queries
about any club, the best
place to ask is during
Freshers’ fair or get in
contact with the club
directly. If you’re inter-
ested in writing, be sure
to get in touch at fsport@

never have even heard of,

bee, futsal and kabaddi.
For freshers and returning
students alike, it can be
confusing to try and find
your preferred sport. Even
within each sports club
there are different teams
which play at different
levels, with mixed or
single-sex teams, contact
or non-contact.
With all this choice
it is difficult to find
a sport you like. You
