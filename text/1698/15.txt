ollowing Apple’s
10th anniversary
iPhone X that was
announced last
fall, the now trillion-dol-
lar company returns to
announce a slew of new
devices that fully embrace
the notch-life; with the
three new iPhone models,
the home button is now
officially dead and new
devices going forward will
start using Face ID as the
security unlock system.
There’s also an updated
Apple Watch available
later this month. Let’s get
right into the details.
The event that was held
in The Steve Jobs Theatre
in the Apple Park campus
was highly anticipated,
mainly because this was
the first opportunity for the
world to see where Apple
would take it’s new gener-
ation of iPhones (starting
from the iPhone X last
year) that are markedly
different in design than
iPhones 6 through 8.
Apple confirmed essen-
tially everything that was
leaked in the days leading
up to the event – it intro-
duced three new iPhone
models: the XS, XS Max,
and XR.
The XS comes with
a 5.8-inch Super Retina
OLED display, while the
XS Max bumps the screen
up to 6.5-inch. Both have
an new and improved
IP68 waterproof rating
(compared to the IP67
rating of last year’s
iPhone X), the new A12
Bionic chip that improves
processing power and
touts the new “neural
engine”, and is offered
in configurations up to
512 GB. It’s got a 7MP
front-facing camera, a
12MP dual main camera
with a new Smart HDR
sensor to help prevent
blurry photos during
action shots and enhance
lighting based on facial
and subject mapping. You
can also adjust the depth
of field after the photo
has been taken, which
reminds me of the Lytro
(RIP).
Compared to the iPhone
X, the XS and XS Max
get up to 30 minutes and
one hour more in battery
life, respectively. The new
devices will support dual
SIM and users can set up
primary and secondary
numbers to know specifi-
cally which of the two is
being contacted.
When it comes to price,
the iPhone XS will start at
£999 and the XS Max will
start from £1,099.
The iPhone line-up is
“The home
button is
now officially
dead and new
devices going
forward will
start using
Face ID as the
security unlock
system”
also being expanded, with
a 6.1-inch LCD phone
called the iPhone XR.
Apple says its screen,
which is liquid retina,
is the first edge-to-edge
LCD handset available.
Like the iPhone XS and
XS Max it has the A12
bionic chip, FaceID, and
no home button. It has the
same TrueDepth Camera
on the front. However,
the XR only has a single
12MP wide-angle camera
on its rear and it doesn’t
have Force Touch.
The XR is being made
available in new colours
– white, black, blue, coral
and yellow. Apple is also
making a Product RED
version of its phone.All of
the versions are made of
an aluminium band with a
glass rear. The iPhone XR
is set to start at £749 and
come with three different
storage options: 64GB,
128GB and 256GB.
However, it’ll only be
available for pre-order
on October 19 and start
shipping on October 26.
Also leaked prior to the
event, the Apple Watch
Series 4 is official. Key
improvements include
a larger display, louder
speaker, slimmer body,
and a red ring around the
digital crown instead of a
solid red circle from the
Series 3. The crown now
has haptic feedback, and
the device hardware uses
a new body that Apple
says improves cellular
connection. It uses a new
S4 chip that should double
the processor speed, and a
new gyroscope sensor that
can detect falls and alert
your SOS contacts of an
accident.
Improving from
watchOS 4’s heart rate
spikes alerts, the new
watch will offer new
health features that detect
unusually low heart rate,
irregular rhythm sympto-
matic of atrial fibrillation,
and take electrocardio-
grams. Users can measure
their ECG by holding their
fingertips to the digital
crown for 30 seconds.
Apple says the device is
cleared by the FDA.
There are also a couple
of new interactive watch
faces, such as a health-fo-
cused one that is designed
to help users through
breathing patterns for
meditation. The Apple
Watch Series 4 starts at
£399 for GPS, £499 for
cellular, and preorders
starting on Friday, Sep-
tember 14th.
While I personally am
not a fan of the clunky
naming of these new
models, there’s no doubt
as to whether the new
iPhones will sell like
hotcakes. They always do.

“The new
Apple Watch
will also offer
new health
features ...
Apple says
the device is
cleared by the
FDA.”
