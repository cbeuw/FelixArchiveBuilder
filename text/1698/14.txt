Does reciting the Ten Commandments reduce cheating
behaviour?
“It is unclear
whether moral
reminders
can reduce
dishonest acts”
Farewell summer,
and welcome to a new
academic year! On the
bright side, Halloween
and Christmas are upon
us, and you get to catch up
with all your friends. On
the downside, however,
is the university-associ-
ated stress: coursework,
presentations and exam-
inations. Even for the
post-graduates amongst
us, the amount of stress
we face upon assessments
and deadline is tremen-
dous – you either sacrifice
sleep or your social life to
maintain your academics.
Nevertheless, there is
always a mischievous way
to dodge the problem:
cheating. While we all
know it is wrong, and
this article is by no means
promoting cheating, one
question had baffled
psychologists around the
globe for years: why do
people do it?
OnetheorybyLawrence
Kohlberg suggests that we
establish moral reasoning
during development. With
education, we would
mature and gain a rational
reasoning capability,
which allows us to make
the right choice with a
morally-correct motive.
Others suggested that
cheating is a choice, where
people would weigh out
the pros and cons of the
act to determine whether
to cheat or not. Other
psychologists suggested
that the decision is not
entirely by choice, as it
is subconsciously influ-
enced by the environment,
where experiments had
shown that people tend to
cheat more in a darkened
room, as compared to a
brightly lit room. It has
also been suggested that
body posture can influ-
ence whether a person
would cheat: as a person
who assumes power poses
(taking as much space as
they can) is more likely
to cheat on a test or park
illegally.
Understanding why
people cheat can allow
school and universities
to prevent cheating. It
had been shown that
placing mirrors within
sight can alone lower
rates of stealing in stores,
as it serves as a tool
for self-reflection upon
doing the deed. In 2008,
a study even showed that
writing down the Ten
Commandments prior to a
test can reduce the rate of
cheating, whether you are
religious or not. All these
suggested that upon the
reminder of moral rules,
people are less likely to
cheat. In practice, perhaps
this is why students are
recited the rules and reg-
ulations prior to taking an
exam.
However, a recent
study proved otherwise.
In a sample size of 4674
participants across 19
labs, participants were
asked to recite the Ten
Commandments, or titles
of 10 books that they
recently read, before
conducting a series of rea-
soning tasks. At the end
of the test, participants
would be asked how many
tasks they accomplished.
If the experiments in
the past hold true, those
that memorised the Ten
Commandments would
have a lower score than
the ‘book-title’ group,
since they should be less
likely to exaggerate how
many tasks they answered
correctly.
Contrarily, the par-
ticipants in the Ten
Commandments group
had a higher prob-
lem-solving rate than the
other group, suggesting
a moral reminder is not
useful in preventing
cheating. Nonetheless,
other factors could have
affected the results. For
one, the culture of the
participants may influ-
ence the outcome, as the
Ten Commandments may
not activate participants’
moral sense in some coun-
tries. Furthermore, the
presence of cameras may
affect the level of honesty
in the participants. Since
it was proven in the past,
that the sense of being
watched can reduce dis-
honest acts – the environ-
ment can certainly have
an effect on the outcome.
Otherwise, the size of the
session may also impact
on the level of dishonesty.
While the outcome of the
experiment is anonymous,
a larger group may give
a sense of security to the
participants, where there
is a less chance of others
discovering they were
deceitful. As a result,
a smaller experiment
session may promote
honesty and vice versa.
To conclude, it is
unclear whether moral
reminders can reduce
dishonest acts, so there
is no rush to printing the
Bible verse and placing it
in your significant others’
wallet, or taking it inside
the exam halls. The next
logical step from this
study would be to collect
more empirical data to
unravel the complexity
of this problem, taking
into consideration of
different factors such as
environment, ethnicity
and upbringing, group
sizes, and religious belief
into consideration when
repeating and validating a
study like this.
