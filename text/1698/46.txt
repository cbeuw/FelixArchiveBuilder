mperial’s Cross
Country & Athletics
Club became the
largest sports club at
Imperial last year, and to
celebrate both the end of
a fantastic season and the
start of another the club
travelled to the north coast
of Wales for their summer
tour in the second week of
September.
The destination was
a 34-bed house in the
slightly odd town of
Colwyn Bay. The club
converged on the barber’s
haven (at least ten hair-
dressers were spotted
in the small town) from
across the country and
beyond – members flew
from Czechia, Tanzania
& Hong Kong to make
the annual ICXCAC
Following a run to
scout out the local area
upon arrival, the first big
group activity was a trip
to the local 5km parkrun
on Saturday morning. The
club’s usual parkrun desti-
nation is at Fulham Palace
which can tend to get
rather congested on the 3
laps of Bishop’s Park, so
Conwy’s out-and-back
route was a welcome
change for the group’s
spot of parkrun tourism.
Amazingly, 3 members
decided to run 20km to
get to the start line of the
weekly community run in
Conwy, whilst the remain-
ing sensible members
opted for the relatively
short minibus hop down
“The game
saw all manner
of atrocities
committed;
the brutal
crushing of
a satsuma, a
spatula used as
a toothbrush,
and one calf of
the incoming
club captain
mercilessly
shaven.”
the dual carriageway. Fol-
lowing a special shoutout
and the usual spiel from
the race director, the
runners were away with
Imperial claiming seven
of the top ten places and
receiving a good deal of
support from locals and
teammates alike along the
course.
With their competitive
appetite not suitably
quenched, the squad
journeyed back to their
mansion for another pres-
tigious event – the Great
ICXCAC Bake-Off.
The club’s long tradi-
tion of offering copious
amounts of baked goods
for ‘degustation’ after the
season’s races meant this
was equally important
training for the year ahead.
The entries included a
wide range of bakes,
from Rice Krispy cakes to
lavish vegan/gluten-free
creations.
Outgoing women’s
captain and tour organ-
iser Anna Lawson was
crowned star baker after
a Mentimeter poll was
used to survey the expert
tasters and despite strong
indications of vote rigging
and corruption (private
browsers apparently allow
you to vote an unlimited
number of times), the
other competitors grace-
fully acknowledged the
deserving champion.
The evening’s enter-
tainment saw a game of
the children’s birthday
party classic: pass-the-
parcel. With ‘challenges’
hidden within each layer
of the mystery package,
the game saw all manner
of atrocities committed;
the brutal crushing of a
satsuma, a spatula used
as a toothbrush, and one
calf of the incoming
club captain mercilessly
shaven. This was followed
by karaoke into the early
hours on the outrageously
loud speaker provided
in the large open-plan
lounge.
The runners were
rudely awoken the next
day by an unpopular
alarm of pan-banging,
and eventually the squad
departed for Snowdonia
with the aim of scoring
as much elevation gain as
possible. The group split
into various paces and
distances and remarkably
managed to converge on
the car park where the
minibuses were left with
astonishing synchronicity,
with only one grazed knee
on the list of casualties.
Before long the week-
enders (PhDs, employed
graduates, long summer
interns, and others with
better things to do on
weekdays) were back off
to the capital.
In the following days
the itinerary was more
relaxed, with the remain-
ing squad of around 20
taking a trip to the local
zoo where they marvelled
at large camels, gazed
up at a well-concealed
red panda, gaped at an
enormous alligator, and
were abused by a red-
faced monkey.
Despite the local athlet-
ics track being closed for
the BBC Proms, the team
were hungry for some
athletics, and so travelled
to Wrexham athletics
track on one of the days
for a mini-Olympics style
set of events in which
four teams competed
over 100m, 200m, 400m,
800m, 1500m, shotput,
discus, long jump, and
4x100m relay. It was a
hotly contested series with
strong potential to make
a return for the club’s
Athletics Taster Day on
October 10th.
The most picturesque
run of the trip took place
on a visit to Llandudno
where the team circum-
navigated the headland
in glorious sunshine with
stunning views of the Isle
of Anglesey.
The Club is already
making plans to return to
the country of dragons,
sheep, and daffodils with
a trail tour heading to
Imperial’s Mountain Hut
in Snowdonia for the first
weekend of November.
There are also plans to
head a tiny bit further
north before the end of
October where the team
will be taking a minibus
up to Manchester to enter
three teams in the univer-
sity club’s cross-country
relays.

The purpose of the
week was to begin to
rebuild fitness after a lazy
summer spent abroad, at
home, or in a stuffy office
serving time at various
internships. Other aspects
of the tour focused on
team-building, and just
a little bit of relaxation
with the team making
amble use of the house’s
entertainment facilities
including a home-cinema,
a surprisingly bass-y
speaker, and various
table-top games including
table football, pool, and
table tennis.
