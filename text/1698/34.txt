Freshers’ 10 under £10

F
reshers is upon
us and you know
what that means
– time for our
bank accounts to hate us.
So you keep tapping that
contactless on every night
out – if you don’t see the
money leaving, it’s not
really gone, right? If only
it worked like that. It can
be quite tempting to splash
out during freshers and go
out to everything – nights
out, greasy breakfasts the
next morning to cure your
hangovers, brunch with
your newfound friends,
takeaway coffees – and it
all seems well and good
till that mini heart attack
hits you when you check
your bank balance. But
rest assured – we’ve
rounded up our top ten
picks for eating out under
£10. You might already
be familiar with some of
these, but we’re sure there
are a few new gems in
there:
1
Elan Café
This little gem of a
coffee shop is just on our
doorstep, being within a
10-minute walk from the
main Imperial College
campus. The décor of this
place has made it one of
the most Instagrammed,
featured cafes in London
and the exquisite pastel
colour theme has put it
on every blogger’s list.
Though it is on the slightly
more expensive end,
there’s some great dishes
you could have for under
£10. They do to-die-for
Acai Bowls for £8.50,
jam-packed Tropical
Bowls for £8, and chia
porridge – your morning
favourite with a twist
for only £6.50! If you do
decide to spend a little
more, their coffees are
worth a try, with all kinds
of lattes from beetroot and
ginger to turmeric and
saffron.
Where? Brompton Road,
and Park Lane.
What? Acai Bowl, or the
English Muffin.
Which meal? Breakfast,
definitely. Or maybe
brunch depending on what
time you’re up.

Nando’s

of those cheesy teen mov-
ies. But alas, it is true.
This Afro-Portuguese
restaurant chain has tru-
ly won everyone’s heart
over – especially on our
student budget. Keen for a
nice, fat burger? They’ve

The Breakfast Club
There’s a reason that
this place has often
been named the ‘best
breakfast in London’
- the diner-style décor
of the place will make
you feel like you’re in a
classic American movie,
and the food from across
the Atlantic will make
you forget about gloomy
English weather. And
who’s to say they only
serve breakfast? Perfect
for hangovers - now give
me that grilled cheese
sandwich.
Where? Soho, London
Bridge, Battersea, or Spi-
talfields
What? Avocado Eggs
on Toast, Salted Caramel
Banoffee Pancakes or the
Breakfast Burrito

Lunch

ASK Italian
ASK has recently
become more and more
popular, and chances
are, you’ve heard of it
or probably frequent one
nearby. Almost every
ASK Italian has to-die-
for interior décor, which
makes having meals
there feel like you’re at
the poshest of restaurants
for a fraction of the
price. Whether you’re
after classic Italian pasta
dishes, pasta or even a
typical breaded chicken
and chips, they’ve got it
all.
Where? Gloucester Road
Arcade, Oxford Street,
The O2, and others
What? Spaghetti Al
Pomodoro, or the oh-so-
yummy Vedure pizza
Which meal? Dinner
