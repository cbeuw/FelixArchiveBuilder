This week, you move
into the Costume Store
without a duvet thinking
ASDA has plenty in stock.
Unfortunately, everyone’s
thought the same thing as
you and you end up using
your Fresher’s guide to
keep you warm at night.

I
t is the end of June.
The sun is blazing,
Love Island has
captivated the
hearts and minds of
the nation and football
is still coming home.
In the depths of South
Kensington, Imperial’s
Summer Ball draws to a
close. In the early hours
of the morning, a lonely
second year takes a seat
outside the Union. His
attempts to woo the girl
of his dreams in Metric
have proven futile and
he’s now having a rare
moment of quiet clarity
and reflection. His friend
approaches, interrupting
the comfortable silence
to reassure him, saying,
“Don’t worry mate… new
year, new talent!” Thus, a
shark is born…
The Oxford English
dictionary defines shark-
ing as “the active pursuit
of first years by third years
(or older) who should
know better”
University is a jungle
and, unfortunately, fresh-
ers are at the bottom of the
food chain, like plankton.
The only way to survive
is to take the necessary
precautionary measures.
It is relatively simple
to identify a shark... they
are always the sweatiest
males in the testoster-
one-infused dungeon that
is Metric. Fourth year
medics are also notorious
sharks.
Like a scene from Jaws,
the sharks will circle their
prey, performing a frankly
uncomfortable mating

Shark Attack!
This week you get lost
at Fresher’s fair looking
for the Christian Union
and somehow end up at
the KinkSoc stand. The
Lord works in mysterious
ways.
This week, after weeks
of posting begging on
the FB group, you finally
manage to swap your
Woodward en-suite single
for a basement room in
Wilson(?), only to realise
you played yourself.
This week you discover
the joys of the Union
curly fry – your life has
been forever changed.
You attempt to revamp
your wadrobe for uni,
and in the process spend
half your student finance.
Unfortunately, your plans
to be the Regina George
of Chem Eng are thwarted
by ‘those meddling inter-
national students’. Better
fish out them receipts…
This week, you experi-
ence your first encounter
with a sweaty underarm
on a packed Central line
train. May this be the first
of many.
This week you rewatch
your friends’ snaps from
their party universities in
eager anticipation of all
the wines you’re planning
on collecting at Imperial.
Ignorance, they say, is
bliss.
This week you buy yet
another Freshers pass to
events around London,
meaning you’ll be attend-
ing 26 events in ten days.
Given that you have acute
FOMO, this complicates
matters.
This week, you try to
win some BNOC points
talking about your ‘gap
yah’ with the ‘common
folk’ in Malaysia. Sadly
this doesn’t go down too
well as you’ve ended up
at the Malaysian Society’s
Meet and Greet.
This week you sign up
in excitement for your
Ethos induction, but can’t
shake the feeling you
might never end up going.
This week you discover
just how thin your room
walls are. Apparently it’s
never too early to start
Biology coursework.
This week you end up
caught in the crossfire as
the Union once again puts
the Israeli and Palestin-
ian Societies together at
Fresher’s Fair. Baklava
and kunafa are launched
across the Great Hall.
“... they are
always the
sweatiest
males in
Metric.”
“BEWARE OF
THE SHARKS!”
dance. If you are able
to evade their awkward
movements, you should
be safe for another night.
