While you were away...
It was, as it very often is, a turbulent summer for music. In this, the first edition of the new academic year, our
music editors take you through some of their personal highlights (and lowlights) of the past few months’ releases.

The third full-length
effort by this indie pop
quartet packs all the
wholesome family-friend-
ly goodness that fans have
come to expect, but not
without a wicked sense
of humour and a quirky,
sci-fi inflected glaze. A
new crisply produced
electronic vibe replaces
their traditionally gui-
tar-led sound, but their
eminently off-kilter
style is still recognisable
behind the spiralling
synths. The record serves
tenacity and tenderness
in equal measure, making
for an all round sublime
experience. They’ll be
coming to London’s Oval
Space in early October,
which is sure to get some
feet stomping and hearts
racing. - AL
If you’re looking for
some stellar music from
the most undeniably
harmless Beatle, stop
reading now. Much of this
album plays like an advert
for a waterproof camera.A
pretty young blonde leads
you through a crowded
room as someone back-
flips off the roof, backed
by the cheers and red cup
raises of all those at the
pool party. You know the
thing. Twee sing-alongs
are interspersed with
overproduced, bassy,
dance tracks and, very
occasionally, glimpses
of brilliance. Age is just
a number – an arbitrary
metric perhaps, but one
that Paul McCartney
happens to be excelling in.
Despite this, he earnestly
tries to sound young and
relatable which, for the
most part, is endearing but
sadly all too often comes
off as vacuous. At its
worst it’s plain creepy (“I
just wanna fuh you”).The
overall tone, however,
is one of positivity. But
I guess optimism isn’t
really the millennial way.
The last few tracks bang
tho. - AL
“a montage
of sounds,
samples,
refrains and
references”
BROCKHAMPTON’s
explosion of fame off the
back of last year’s Satura-
tion trilogy coupled with
the understandable trauma
of the whole Ameer situ-
ation has clearly weighed
on them. This communal
stress lends a certain
cohesion to the themes
explored on this new effort
(it gets deep(er)) as well
as a certain meticulous
and often spectacular dar-
ingness in sound derived
from a fuck-giving-fatigue
(‘TAPE’, ‘WEIGHT’ and
the outro on ‘DISTRICT’
are particularly beautiful).
Nevertheless, the theme
of fame-induced depres-
sion teeters on repetitive
at times, and a handful of
songs or moments sound
turbulent to the point of
jarring or disorientating.
Take ‘HONEY’ for
example. The yo-yoing
bass spliced with sound
effects and weird, low
pitched “uhuh-uhuh”
vocals is fine, but the
switch up, though pretty
at first, ends up feeling
frustratingly suspended
mid-metamorphasis. Joba
goes ham throughout the
album though. - AR
On his last album,
Freetown Sound, Blood
Orange founded a formula
to his sound that he clearly
has a natural inclination
towards. Accordingly,
he uses the same style
on Negro Swan, now
focusing in on black de-
pressionandisolation.The
style is hard to describe:
it’s a unique, delicate,
instrumentation-guided
montage of sounds,
samples, refrains and
references that seeks to
collate vibes, leaving the
listener with a narrative
experience as nuanced,
honest and deliberate as a
long diary entry. Which is
ironic because, especially
on this album, we don’t
get many direct, divulging
verses. Yet you never find
yourself lost. - AR
Death Grips returned
in late June. True to form,
the album was teased with
a picture of Shrek director
Andrew Adamson in the
studio. And true to form,
the entire feature is “I’m
in the studio working
with Death Grips on their
new album.” The album,
sporting track titles like
‘Linda’s in Custody’ and
‘Shitshow’, is exactly
what you’d expect. It’s a
slightly poppier move for
Death Grips (if DG is ever
‘poppy’), but otherwise,
it’s par for the course; a
paranoid-schizophrenic
landscape populated
by MC Ride’s frenetic
screaming and Zach Hill’s
manic drum-spam. New
territory is DJ Swamp’s
scratching and Justin
Chancellor (of Tool fame)
playing bass. Overall,
the album felt somewhat
unmotivated; along with
2016’s Bottomless Pit,
this gets stacked on the
DG ‘meh’pile. If you like
Death Grips, you’ll like
this album. Otherwise, eh,
go check out Exmilitary.

Everything Protomar-
tyr touches turns to gold.
Singer Joe Casey has
zeroed in on a unique
brand of image-rich
lyricism and half-singing,
half-shouting baritone
delivery that is at once
entirely individual and yet
evocative of bygone punk
rock eras. Combined with
the clashing dissonance
of the rest of the band,
the reified post-punk
sound has been revived
and reshaped into a mood
more suitable for the
Rust Belt dystopia that
is modern-day Detroit.
The band first broke into
the big-time with 2015’s
fantastic Agent Intellect
(my very first Felix
review), and carried their
momentum with the criti-
cally-acclaimed Relatives
in Descent, which made
many a top-of-the-year list
last January. Protomartyr
sound fresh and original
as ever here, arguably
soaring to new highs on
the especially-fantastic
‘Wheel of Fortune’. Don’t
miss this fantastic album.
