O
n the last
S a t u r d a y
of the term,
the Imperial
Falcons descended to
Farnham Park for the
National University
Baseball Championships.
The inconvenient date
of the event meant many
club members could not
attend the tournament.
Thankfully, we were able
to field a full team due to
Abrar Masud joining last
minute, even though he
was ill and had literally
chundered in the morning.
who was much larger than
him. It doesn’t take Jake’s
knowledge of momentum
and collisions to tell you
that it would end badly
for him. Jake ended up
with a concussion and
was in hospital for the rest
of the tournament. Fortu-
nately, he has recovered.
Unfortunately, he is still
studying Physics.
Playing more than eight
hours of baseball is tiring,
and even more so when
the team is a man down.
Imperial struggled for the
rest of the tournament.
Highlights of the day
include Joseph Koulson
striking out most of UEA,
Markkkk’s curveball
being filthier than Edo,
Jonathan Cheung finally
scoring a run, Andrew
Counsell getting hit by a

pitch almost every game,
and Bryan Chong’s at-
tempted bunt.
Durham 2s were kind
enough to lend us Brad, a
spare player, for our game
against them. Brad volun-
teered himself to pitch an
inning for us. Brad talked
the talk and then walked
every batter he faced. He
threw zero strikes and
even hit a batter. The team
hasn’t decided if Brad was
bad, or Durham had just
played 4D chess with us.
By the end of the day,
everyone was exhausted.
Jonathan, the back-up
catcher, had never
squatted for so long in his
life. Asked to describe the
team’s performance in one
word, Abrar commented
“participation”. Regard-
less, Imperial had just
placed 8th in a national
tournament*.
Shoutout and farewell
to the following graduat-
ing members:
Edo Lisi, who has been
a member of the club for
four years. He brought
great fun and chat to all
the training sessions.
Justin Chu, another
veteran of the club, who
would always appear
out of nowhere to nail a
diving catch.
Daniel Zarasua, who has
flown back to the States.
His equipment donations
were much appreciated
and his passion for the
game will be missed.

The first game was
played against Durham’s
first team. Being the only
university to field two
teams, Durham looked
to be the favourites.
Nevertheless, the game
was fought closely in the
first few innings thanks
to a huge line drive home
run by Mark Skopec,
Edo Lisi’s knuckleball
pitching and an acrobatic
double play by Daniel
Kok. Unfortunately, when
it looked like Imperial
were gaining momentum,
Jake Lee decided to hustle
his way home on a wild
pitch. Jake, a second year
physicist, ran into a pitcher
Joe Ronan, who has
snaked us for LSE next
year, will be remembered
best for playing two
games of baseball with a
collapsed lung.
Daniel Kok, who brought
versatility to the team
with his switch hitting

hitting left), and brought
even more laughs with his
attempt to “switch field”.
His attempts to relief pitch
will not be missed.
Mark Skopec, who shared
his national team expe-
rience with the club and
made huge offensive con-
tributions to every game
he played. His largest
contribution to Imperial
Baseball is still the game
Pepper.
