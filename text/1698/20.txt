iterally trans-
lating to “And
Your Mother
Too”, Y Tu Mama
Tambien is a coming-of-
age film set in Mexico
about two young men and
an older woman searching
for an invented beach
called “la Boca del Cielo”,
or “Heaven’s Mouth”.
Two teenagers, Tenoch
and Julio, entice Luisa
to accompany them on a
journey that challenges
their friendship. It is in la
Boca del Cielo where the
boys become men, as the
raw and rural landscape of
Mexico seduce the trio in
ways the city couldn’t. We
ride along on this bitter-
sweet road trip with these
characters and become
nostalgic ourselves, as the
film leaves plenty of room
to ponder. The film is
beautifully photographed
by frequent collaborator
Emmanuel Lubezki, and
Cuaron’s trademark long
take is a perfect way into
the socio-political sub-
text within the film. The
frame gracefully wanders
around the scene – the
camera movement is ro-
bustly choreographed like
that of a dance routine.
Using these devices,
Cuaron maturely depicts
immaturity in a way that
is neither exploitative
nor sugar-coated. It’s
an important film in
the back-catalogue of
Cuaron, who went on to
direct Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban,
Children of Men and
Gravity. Y Tu Mama
Tambien is masterful in
its vibrant portrayal of the
cusp of adolescence and
adulthood.
“Cuaron
maturely
depicts
immaturity
in a way that
is neither
exploitative
nor sugar-
coated.”
“John Keating
is the mentor
we all hope
we had, a
mentor who
encourages
us to do the
things we
want before
time runs out”
“This is not based on
a true story,” the movie
opens. Then the “not
based on” disappears,
leaving “This is a true
story”. American Animals
is about four friends
who plot a heist to inject
excitement into their
otherwise mundane lives
– it is based on the events
that took place in 2004,
in Lexington, Kentucky.
Their target? $12 million
worth of rare books
housed at the University
of Transylvania library,
only guarded by one
old librarian. Contrary
to the great tradition of
glitzy and glamourous
caper movies, American
Animals juggles into the
mix a more somber com-
ing-of-age element. What
starts off as a harmless
attempt in making their
lives ‘special’ quickly
twists into something
nastier; all spawning
out of the shared feeling
of wanting more than
mediocrity. Writer-Di-
rector Bart Layton uses
interview footage of the
real people involved in
the heist throughout the
film, which is a device he
has used before. Layton’s
directorial debut, The
Imposter, similarly
interweaved re-enact-
ments with documentary
footage; the reverse has
been done in American
Animals, where the narra-
tive is mostly told through
actors with interjections
from the real criminals.
A hugely enjoyable true-
crime film, perfect for fans
of Making a Murderer and
American Vandal.
Arguably one of the
greatest high school
dramas, Dead Poets
Society tells the story of
how English teacher John
Keating (Robin Williams)
inspires his students to
live their lives to the
fullest. Carpe diem, or
‘seize the day’, a phrase
volcanically popularised
by the film, perfectly
encapsulates Keating’s
philosophy and the film’s
central theme. Bolstered
by resounding perfor-
mances and an impec-
cable screenplay, Dead
Poets Society remains
infinitely relatable up to
this day. High school, the
time when limitless hopes
for the future intersects
with the impending reali-
sation of adulthood. How
many have wanted to lead
extraordinary lives, and
how many have given in
to reality? John Keating
is the mentor we all hope
we had, a mentor who
encourages us to do the
things we want before
time runs out. And at the
end of the day, it does not
really matter whether we
had a John Keating in our
lives; Dead Poets Society
implores us to be the John
Keating of other people,
to be the captain to those
who are lost, simultane-
ously enriching our own
lives. Carpe diem, every-
body, carpe diem.
