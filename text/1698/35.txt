Wagamama’s
This Japanese restau-
rant is so many people’s
favourite and we can
definitely understand why.
With such a wide variety
of items on the menu, an
authentic Japanese setup
of tables in the restaurants,
and an endless supply of
green tea, this is a student
haven for yummy food.
If you can get past the
(mediocre) service and
slow waiting, having a
meal here is 10000%
worth it. Their juices and
smoothies are also so re-
freshing and complement
the spicy cuisine perfectly.
Where? Pretty much
anywhere. High Street
Kensington,
What? Chicken Ramen,
or the popular Chicken
Katsu Curry.
Which meal? Dinner.

Franco Manca
Three words: Best.
Pizza. Ever. Franco
Manca’s pizza is not only
affordable, but also really
tasty as it’s made on a
sourdough base, which
gives it a cool, slightly
chewy texture. Sounds
weird, but basically, it’s
like eating tomato sauce
and toppings on really
good bread. Plus, some
venues have good student
deals and all have a vegan
option – it will definitely
become one of your staple
pizzas!
Where? Everywhere.
South Ken, Covent
Garden, Soho, Fitzrovia,
King’s Cross, Shepherd’s
Bush, Fulham and others
What? Classic Tomato &
Mozzarella, or Courgette,
Mozzarella & Ricotta
pizza

BAO
Have you seen the
Incredibles 2? Well, the
short film that precedes
the movie features a little
baby dumpling – a bao.
Bao are round, soft, fat
steamed buns originating
from Taiwan, filled with a
stuffing commonly made
with pork. BAO amps this
basic bun up, with fillings
including chicken, beef,
fish or vegetarian options,
as well as other Chinese
specialties for the bao-hat-
ers (we see you). Comfort
food with a Chinese twist.
Where? Soho, Fitzrovia
What? Classic, Fried
Chicken or Black Cod
Bao

Wasabi
It’s our personal
favourite (and our bank
account’s favourite),
Wasabi. Famous for their
sushi dishes, the seafood
Wasabi has to offer is
top class. Their sushi
always tastes fresh as it’s
made daily, as is their hot
food. Their Katsu Curry
is a crowd favourite, as
is their sweet and sour
chicken, which comes
either served with rice or
noodles. Also, about half
an hour before closing
time, most Wasabis
reduce everything to half
price, so you can stock up
for lunch the next day too!
Where? South Kensing-
ton, High St Kensington,
Hammersmith, and
around every other corner
What? Katsu Curry,
Wasabi Rainbow Set, or
the Salmon Nigiri Set
Which meal? Lunch

Flat Iron
Good quality and de-
cent price are words that
never really come togeth-
er when it comes to steak.
At Flat Iron, you can or-
der a tasty (!) steak with
an included salad for £10,
allowing you to eat a fan-
cy meal out with your new
friends or SO without be-
coming broke. If you so
desire, various chips and
veggies are also available
as sides. And did I men-
tion the complimentary
cup of popcorn?
Where? Soho, Covent
Garden, Shoreditch
What? Classic Steak
