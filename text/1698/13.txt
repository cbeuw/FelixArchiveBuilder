Take a deep breath: Biologics are set to change the
global treatment of severe asthma

magine being a
young woman, who
is told that the drug
you are prescribed
by your doctor is going to
cause you to gain weight,
and have uncontrollable
mood swings. Or perhaps,
a young man who is aware
that your medication may
cause cataracts in your
eyes, changes to the shape
of your face, or your
blood pressure to increase.
However, not taking the
drug will mean that you
cannot climb the stairs to
your attic, go for a swim
with your kids, socialise,
or even work. This is the
unfortunate dilemma for
many young people diag-
nosed with severe asthma,
which affects around 1 in
20 asthma patients world-
wide; and is often treated
by steroids such as pred-
nisone – which results in
nasty side effects.
The causes of severe
asthma are not always
known, but in some
patients, it is thought
that inflammation of the
airways may be trig-
gered by high levels of
a particular white blood
cell called an eosinophil.
A new class of drugs is
now being developed for
these patients, that may
change the way they are
treated – biologics. These
drugs target the under-
lying cellular changes
which cause asthma,
either by targeting im-
munoglobulins to combat
allergic asthma, or by
targeting cytokines such
as interleukins and thymic
stromal lymphopoietin, to
work against eosinophilic
asthma by lowering eosin-
ophil levels.
With a range of new
biologics coming onto the
market, this is an exciting
time for respiratory cli-
nicians – if one biologic
does not work for your
patient, fear not – there
are other options. Clinical
trials are still required to
make direct comparisons
between these drugs as
we are uncertain which
are more effective and in
which patients – but what
we do know is that these
drugs offer a great deal of
hope to patients who do
not respond to or cannot
tolerate the side effects of
standard treatments such
as steroids and beta-ago-
nists.
One concern that has
been raised is that eosin-
ophils play a role fighting
infection caused by par-
asitic worms – so could
drugs that lower eosin-
ophil levels increase in-
fection rates in patients in
tropical countries? We do
not yet have the evidence
to show this, but it has
been highlighted that this
potential issue should be
considered as these drugs
become more widely
used. Nevertheless, this
remains an exciting time
in the respiratory therapy
field, with biologics set
to revolutionise the treat-
ment landscape for severe
asthma over the next 5–10
years.

designed an experiment to
understand why the couch
attracts us so much more
than a good workout. The
group led by Matthieu
Boisgontier discovered
that the human brain
might innately prefer the
lack of physical activity.
The human kind would
not have survived without
energy conservation
mechanisms. We had to
prioritise our basic needs:
water, food, shelter or re-
production, so any unnec-
essary activity would lead
to the waste of precious
energy. Boisgontier’s
group studied whether
this evolutionary adapta-
tion could be blamed for
the fiasco of numerous
campaigns encouraging
physical activity.
Young adults participat-
ing in the experiment were
asked to control an avatar
on a computer screen, by
moving it towards flashed
small images representing
physical activity, and
away from physical inac-
tivity, as quickly as they
could. Later the task was
reversed: the avatar had
to move towards inactive
images, and away from
active ones. Throughout
the whole experiment
researchers measured the
brain activity of partici-
pants.
Participants acted
faster in the first case,
which confirmed the
results of previous studies
conducted by the groups.
“The exciting novelty of
our study is that it shows
this faster avoidance of
physical inactivity comes
at a cost - and that is an
increased involvement of
brain resources,” Bois-
gontier reported. It might
mean that our brains are
just wired to keep us lazy!
The results explain
why we struggle so much
to choose jogging over
Netflix. Can we change
our brains preferences?
“Anything that happens
automatically is difficult
to inhibit, even if you
want to, because you do
not know that it is happen-
ing,” Boisgontier warned.
But he also reassured that
awareness of this process
can help us act against our
innate laziness.
So, if you don’t feel
like sweating today,
remember: it’s not your
fault!

Did you skip that gym session again? Blame evolution – it made us lazy, a new study from University of British
Columbia indicates.
