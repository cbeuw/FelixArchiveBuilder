Well, here’s a little
Kavfefe that’s been
dominating the US news
cycle recently (anyone
remember those kids in
concentration camps?
They’re still there for the
record). Brett Kavanaugh,
potential appointee to the
Supreme Court of the
United States, has had
a rough few weeks. The
media circus was brewing
over (possible gambling)
debts paid off by shady
campaign-finance groups
to the tune of $150k and
non-answers to basic
legal questions about
precedent-laden cases,
and he had a peculiarly
Zuckerbergesque imita-
tion of human behavior
that just kinda put people
off; we like our lizards
with scales unvarnished
by having your daugh-
ter’s softball team in the
fucking room during your
nomination hearing. We
were primed for Kav to
be squirted along like so
much impacted stool -
motility, that’s the power
of ex-lax - then Feinstein
showed up.
Here’s a curveball:
activist judge for “family
values” (i.e. fuck gay
people and women) turns
out to be a nympho. Who
raped people. Sorry, “al-
legedly,” - that is, alleged
by multiple credible and
corroborating witnesses
begging for the FBI inves-
tigation the Kavster seems
to really not want - one
under threat of perjury.
Sorry, investigation? The
elephants in the room
(the Rs) declined to use
that Federal Bureau. And
for the record, the set of
allegations keeps building
and building.
The GOP knew about
Kav being a perv last
week. That’s why didn’t
want to go through with
him, and why Grassley’s
been such an ass to the
unfortunate Dr Ford.
Ultimately, the fault lies
at 1600 Penn Ave - Trump
wanted him because it’s
an assured vote against
criminal prosecution,
potentially allowing him
to weather the storm of a
constitutional crisis with a
stacked SCOTUS (recall
their taking the nuclear
option, evading conven-
tional bipartisanship in
the process, to confirm
Gorsuch). Cretinous
parasites they are, senate
Republicans coddled up
to Trump and tried to
ram Kavanaugh through,
full-well knowing the
accusations against him
before news broke (for
the record, Ford’s letter to
Diane Feinstein goes back
to July).
It started to look like
the Rs wouldn’t get
over the hump. Mon-
ey-bomb funds arrayed
against Sens. Collins and
Murkowski if they vote
up on Kavanaugh were
amassed for their next
elections (how’s that
sound for Citizens United
v. United States). Kav’s
polls started to suck more
- lowest for any Supreme
Court nominee of recent
memory. The Dems finally
grew something approx-
imating a spine, and it
appeared that maybe, just
maybe, they could edge
out this play and send him
packing.
Not so fast. Trump
would never pass up the
opportunity to do some-
thing egregiously stupid.
Here’s the thing
about Ur-fascism: its
proponents are dumb.
Really dumb. Trump, as
of Tuesday’s writing, has
absolutely fucked it. He’s
of staff John Kelley.
Rosenstein again referred
to the matter as fabri-
cation. Trump’s rumor
mill churned, but nobody
ended up confused. We’re
in prime position for an
immaculate self-own.
Oh, and wasn’t it
sweet. Trump’s Neander-
thal staffers leaked to the
media that the whole thing
had been a show staged
to distract from the Ka-
vanaugh hearing, hoping
the GOP could stuff
Kav through. And in the
process, they put them-
selves in legal jeopardy
for a much clearer ob-
struction of justice case.
What a fucking idiot.
If we were playing
normal politics, Trump’s
laid all his cards and
tried to put out a ten-
alarm fire with a nuclear
bomb. Amateur political

leaking that in private
conversations he “didn’t
like Kavenaugh,” oozing
away with all the deter-
mination and presence of
mind of a common garden
slug fleeing salt. Rewind:
he tried to fire Rosenstein.
It didn’t work. Rosenstein
called his bluff. Trump
blinked on Tuesday.
Rewind again. The slug’s
multi-function orifice
wheezed a noxious cloud
in the process: rumors
circulated that Rosenstein
was going to resign.
Rosenstein rebuffed; the
lie was doubled-down
on when the rumor

bravado and sheer stupidi-

confrontation with the
deputy attorney general in
charge of a probe posing
an existential threat to the
administration (as of the
day before publication
- ha, print deadlines).
As of publication, we’ll
have seen whether Trump
blinks a second time.
Knowing Trump, he
almost assuredly will.
