New term, hoo dis? The 2018 album prospectus
Some albums are destined for greatness. I treasure the rest, and hoard them in my squalid flat.

I
t’s no secret that
music is released.
But figuring out
what’s coming out,
and when, can be a bit
of a chore. I’ve curated
a list of albums over the
horizon our readers might
care to listen to (if only
for jokes).
Coheed and Cambria.
Vaxis – Act I: The Un-
heavenly Creatures.
2015’s The Color
Before The Sun was an en-
joyable but strange album
for the Coheed corpus.
Their first non-concept
album, set outside the
universe fleshed out in
Claudio’s comic-book
side project was well-re-
ceived but left diehard
Coheed fans wanting for
the epic scope and breadth
of their previous works.
This return to the Coheed
stomping ground may
possibly fare better with
the palates of Coheed
fans.
Electric Six. Bride of
the Devil.
I wanna take you to a
gay bar, gay bar, gay bar!
Electric Six is an instant
classic among seventh
graders. Danger: high
voltage!
Kurt Vile. Bottle It In.
Kurt’s classic. Your
favorite dissociative
performer is back,
presumably with more
lovely guitar tone and
dazed delivery. If you’re
unfamiliar with his work,
I’d recommend a dive into
his previous output – I
swear I only noticed a few
weeks ago that ‘Wakin’
on a pretty day’ is nine
minutes long.
Eric Clapton. Happy
Xmas.
IT’S NOT FUCKING
CHRISTMAS THOUGH.
IT’S FUCKING
OCTOBER. OCTOBER
FUCKING TWELFTH
IS WHEN THIS ALBUM
DROPS. I thought the
common cultural con-
sensus was that mid-No-
vember is the sanctioned
start to the season, though
those of you with dignity
will tend to put off the
eggnog-swilling until at
least December 1st
. I swear
to Christ if I catch any of
you spinning Christmas
jingles before first frost I
will name and shame you
in these here very pages.
THIS. MAKES. ME.
UPSET.
Twenty One Pilots.
Trench.
HAHAHAHAHAHA.
Just kidding.
Haken. Vector.
Haken has done some
pretty twisted stuff. The
London-based prog-metal
group has diddled in
virtually every movement
and time signature in the
genre. Their superfluous
technicality is evident
throughout their corpus;
a brief peruse on Spotify
is essentially mandatory
for all you so-called met-
al-heads out there.
Pentatonix. Christmas
is here.
IT’S STILL FUCKING
NOT. How many
goddamn times do I have
to rehash such an extraor-
dinarily banal point? If
Halloween hasn’t passed
yet, I’d invite you to cram
your Christmas spirit up
your ass.
Yoko Ono. Warzone.
I’m nominating
everyone’s favorite
pseudo-Beatle on the
off-chance she brings the
screaming back, like that
art-gallery performance.
That was punk as fuck.
Ty Segall. Fudge
Sandwich.
Well, it’s an album of
covers, but it’s a Ty Segall
album nonetheless.
Sun Kil Moon. This is
My Dinner.
The first time I heard
Sun Kil Moon I got the
impression that Brad
Nowell didn’t really die
of a heroin overdose – he
wandered off to Tibet, did
lots of drugs, mellowed
out, and chainsmoked his
way to a baritone. I can’t
really explain why – obvi-
ously this is pretty distinct
from punk ska – but the
Long Beach vibes Brad
and co. captured so effec-
tively pervade Sun’s opus.
Jeff Goldblum. The
Capital Studios Sessions.
Holy shit, really?
Mark Knopfler. Down
the Road Wherever.
I mean, he is the sultan
of swing. As a diehard fan
of fingerpicking (nylon
strings all day baby) I am
obligated to recommend
anything Marky-Mark
puts out.
Muse. Simulation
Theory.
It’s 2018. I don’t really
see anyone getting super
jazzed-up about it.
Mumford and Sons.
Delta.
This better be on your
radar, my dudes. The
Church youth group is
never gonna know what
hit ‘em. It’s basically a
crime to deprive them of
these soon-to-be bangin’
jams.
Smashing Pumpkins.
Shiny and Oh So Bright,
Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No
Future. No Sun.
Billy Corgan, my
beloved, my beautiful
baby boy. That guy sure
loves his cats. I guess
they’re still making
music as the Smashing
Pumpkins too. Judging
from that clusterfuck of a
title, I’m sure it’ll all work
out just fine.

T
he Windows
boot sounds are
unknown gems
of the music
world. Brian Eno was a
collaborator!
12. Windows 98 Plus!
Legitimately awful. I can’t
believe the marketing
theme thought this was a
good idea. If I heard this
noise out of my computer,
I’d try to put it out with a
fire extinguisher.
11.WindowsXPHome
Edition. God, they really
couldn’t be bothered with
this one, could they? Just
slap four random keys and
call it a day. No grandeur.
No triumph.
10. Windows 8. The
slight syncopation and
more percussive feel adds
a bit of spice and fresh-
ness to the world of boot
sounds, and yet the piece
is as joyless and corporate
as the company making it.
9. Windows Vista.
Nearly worse than the last
one, except that the up
ending reflects the feeling
of success one feels when
Vista finally fucking
decided to boot for once.
I’m still mad that this was
generously given the label
of “operating system.”
8. Codename:
Whistler. The clashy,
jangly vibe this pulls
is downright repulsive.
I wouldn’t wish use
of a computer running
Whistler on my worst
enemy in the unlikely yet
still terrifying scenario
that, while in mortal
combat, we end up falling
into a time machine and
get dropped 20 years in
the past.
7. Windows Vista
Beta. Techno-future
garbage. But at least the
harmony is a little more
ambitious. Sounds like
something a shitty club in
Berlin would play.
6. Windows NT
Workstation 4.0. Still
trash, but this is much
less objectionable; after
all, this is a legitimate
product of the mid-90s.
And there’s something
mighty appealing about
the swirling synths, the
mellowed near-pure sine,
and the innocence with
which this was clearly
composed.
5. Windows 98. The
vocals are simply angelic.
4. Windows NT
Workstation 5.0. Talk
about cacophony. When
those synths actually kick,
it’s a pretty slick feeling.
Damn, was 5.0 ahead of
its time.
3. Trident. No, not the
bomb. Convention-break-
ing and legitimately
futuristic. Fantastic.
2. Windows 95. What
a tremendous blend of
future and past. The
synths sweep in, soft,
delicate – filtered glock-
enspeil greet the airy
composition. Tension is
introduced to the piece
when the last glockenspeil
strike is repeated in tripli-
cate – perhaps startling the
unwary user, causing them
to believe their computer
has hung yet again. The
slight fade reassures the
more alert and/or caffein-
ated. And just when you
thought it couldn’t get
any better, we are greeted
with a pleasantly familiar
entity, the warm embrace
of an old friend. I speak of
the next entry in this very
ranking...
1. Windows 3.1. If it
ain’t broke, don’t fucking
fix it.
