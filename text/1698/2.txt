We got this!
I
’ll try to keep this
brief and not too
cheesy.
You and I have some-
thing in common; today
marks a new beginning.
You'll have just moved
into your new halls and
had the exciting taste of
freedom for the first time.
I am putting the finishing
touches on the first issue
of Felix for the year!
Casting my mind back
four years, I remember
my own move-in day
being nothing short of a
disaster. Despite living
about 40 minutes away in
North West London and
quite literally being given
the whole day to arrive, I
somehow still managed
to arrive half an hour
late to Gabor Hall. After
promptly moving my
stuff into my room and
checking out my kitchen
cupboard space, I was then
mistaken for a cleaner by
the first of my floor mates
that I approached to intro-
duce myself. They must
have thought it was “bring
your family to work day”!
My swift transformation
into a social pariah wasn’t
helped by my decision to
skip the floor meet-and-
greet. Instead, I opted to
go for a cheeky Nando’s
trip, simultaneously
succeeding in isolating
myself and inadvertently
adhering to two black
stereotypes: being late
and loving chicken.
I must admit it has been
very bizarre and feelt
almost surreal for me to
have technically finished
university but still be
coming back to the same
campus I just spent four
years at, on a daily basis.
I’m often tempted to
resume my normal routine
of napping in my usual
spot at the back of LT 2
in the Chem Eng depart-
ment. For me, this role
presented an unmissable
opportunity to cling to my
youth by prolonging my
stay at university (in some
capacity) and deferring
my entry into the "real
world" for another year. If
four years at Imperial has
taught me anything, it is
how to procrastinate and
plagiarise effectively.
As a serial procrastina-
tor, it should come as no
shock to anybody that I
am currently writing this
editorial four hours before
the looming print deadline
and I'm desperately
waffling to fill up space.
What better way to waffle
than to explain my route
into Felix in painstaking
detail?
I first got involved in
Felix two years ago, as
a music writer. I am a
massive fan of hip-hop
(Kendrick Lamar, Drake
and J. Cole being my three
favourite artists right
now), and regularly found
myself writing album
reviews and discussing
hip-hop culture in general.
Felix was an easy way for
me to express my views
for anybody that fancied
a read. The natural
transition was to become
a Music Editor, a role
I fulfilled last year and
thoroughly enjoyed.
This year, I bid
farewell to my beloved
Music section, leaving
it in the capable hands
of Simran, Asad, Adrian
and Henry. My amateur
music journalism has bled
out into my podcast, "2
Gs in a Pod" (shameless
plug!). This is something
of a passion project of
mine but please give it a
listen on SoundCloud and
iTunes if you ever want to
hear me debate music and
hip-hop culture with my
co-host, Isaac.
This year, I embark on
a new challenge as Edi-
tor-in-Chief. Although I
trytomaintainacool,calm
and collected exterior, as
the print deadline edges
ever close, I'm internally
feeling the same nerves
I expect many of you are
feeling as you start this
new chapter in your life.
Let's encourage eachother
to wreck-it like Ralph and
make the most of these
new beginnings; we got
this!
