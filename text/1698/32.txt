Best of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2018
Every year during the month of August, culture vultures flock to Edinburgh for the annual Fringe Festival; the
largest arts festival in the world. Here are some of our comedy highlights – watch out for London dates!

Linda
S
eated in a cosy
Underbelly venue,
we are told the story
of Linda, an average
57-year-old woman who
is selected to travel to
Mars. We hear not from
Linda herself; instead
her story is told through
the people around her,
showing us some of the
challenges she faced and
revealing why she might
want to leave her town in
the first place…
I wasn’t quite sure
what to expect from a
one-woman show, but
comedian Freya Slipper
did not disappoint. Her
impressions are uncanny
and amusing, from a dis-
organised Spanish Zumba
teacher to a blundering
politician nodding her
way through a television
interview. These carica-
tures, though absurd at
times, are highly relatable
and consequently very
entertaining. Favour-
ite moments include
side-splittingly funny
audience participation,
a disastrous episode at
Brownies, and voicemails
from demanding children
(as I said, relatable –
sorry Mum!) The overall
message celebrates simple
kindnesses by ordinary
people, who put their own
dreams to one side to help
those around them. We all
know a Linda. #GetLinda-

Enter the
Dragons
T
his play is all
about the ageing
woman, exam-
ining societal
pressures and making
sense of them through the
form of a mythical quest
in pursuit of Kronos, who
represents ageing. As we
journey through mystical
lands we encounter a
number of quirky char-
acters, from Sirens in the
Sea of Apology, to Seers
who give advice and help
to guide us towards our
destination.
We face a number of
challenges, from sorting
items of luggage that
are too heavy to cross
the Bridge of Tears, to
solving confusing riddles
and escaping mad doctors.
Do we make it to meet
Kronos? And what does
he have to say for himself
when we meet him face
to face? You’ll have to
find out yourself. And as
winner of the Best Show
at the Brighton Fringe
2018, it’s definitely worth
a watch.
Hot Gay Time
Machine
Q
ueuing with my
ticket, I hear a
commotion behind
me. “Out of the way, V.
I. Gay coming through.”
Turning around I see two
hot, gay men pushing their
way through a delighted
crowd. After the success
of their award-winning
Fringe debut musical
Six, creators Zak Ghazi-
Torbati and Toby Marlow
are back with Hot Gay
Time Machine. The
double act exude energy
from start to finish, joking,
dancing, and singing their
way through this highly
enjoyable cabaret.
Self-conscious in the
best kind of way, the boys
use their time machine to
take us back to moments
in their lives, from making
friends at university to
coming out to their mums.
Along the way they
explore – through music –
a variety of topics such as
identity and consent, bal-
ancing serious messages
perfectly with moments of
genius comedy such that
the final product leaves
you reflective, uplifted
and entertained. With their
crowd-pleasing numbers,
effort to include the whole
audience (even passing
the Bechdel Test…),
and clear adoration for
Beyoncé, you can’t help
but love this show. Sensa-
tional.
Craicling
I
f you enjoy sketch
comedy, then Foil,
Arms and Hog are the
Irish trio for you. Their
highly polished sketches
had me in stitches, inter-
spersed with seemingly
ad-lib impressions and im-
provisations which were
a hit with the audience.
From lessons on how to
hold a baby, to a day in the
life of a monk, Foil, Arms
and Hog find comedy in
all walks of life. I’d love
to take them home and
introduce them to me
Mam but in the meantime,
I’ll have to make do with
their Facebook videos.
Look ‘em up!
