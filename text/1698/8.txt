The Labour Party does not have a problem

T
he ancient
Chinese had a
curse: ‘may he
live in interesting
times’ – well these are
interesting times when the
president of the United
States claims there are
good people on the side
of neo-Nazis and with
the electoral success
of far-right neo-Nazi
political groups all over
Europe and America. But
as Aesop’s tale of the boy
who cried wolf reminds
us, it is ultimately danger-
ous and counterproductive
in cheapening the accu-
sation of anti-Semitism.
The most successful
British Jewish politician
in recent times has been
Ed Miliband, the former
leader of the Labour
Party. Before him, it
was his brother David
Miliband the former for-
eign secretary in a Labour
Government. Of course,
there are fringes within
the Labour movement
who are anti-Semites
– with individuals who
fixate all their attention
on the human rights viola-
tions by Israeli state (and
blame Israeli citizens for
the actions of their gov-
ernment) whilst ignoring
the far more numerous
crimes of other countries
in that neighbourhood.
But the claims made by
some Blairite MPs of
widespread anti-Semitism
within the rank and file of
the labour party is nothing
more than an attempted
propaganda campaign
to protect themselves
from deselection and
to overthrow Jeremy
Corbyn.
Let us be clear, the
Labour party has accepted
the full International
Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance (IHRA) defini-
tion of anti-Semitism and
seven out of the eleven
illustrations. The entire
claim of Jeremy Corbyn’s
supposed anti-Semitism
rests on the partial rejec-
tion of these four named
examples, thus it’s para-
mount for the other side of
the argument to be heard
without being labelled an
anti-Semite.
Now this is not to say
that the Labour leadership
has not muddled a political
soft-ball and exasperated
the issue unnecessarily. Of
the four initially rejected
examples, three of which
should have easily been
accepted:
1. Accusing Jewish
citizens of being more
loyal to Israel, or to the
alleged priorities of Jews
worldwide, than to the
interests of their own
nations.
2. Applying double
standards to Israel by
requiring of it a behaviour
not expected or demanded
of any other democratic
nation
3. Drawing compar-
isons of contemporary
Israeli policy to that of the
Nazis.
Thesepoliticalmistakes
should not be confused
with anti-Semitism, as
they are centred on the
nation state of Israel, and
not on the Jewish religion.
Just as having a dispropor-
tional amount of criticism
of Saudi Arabia does not
make one an Islamophobia
nor does claiming British
Hindus have a greater
loyalty to India make one
anti-Hindu. However, it is
important for the Labour
leadership to look beyond
its own intentions and
understand the very legiti-
mate fears of British Jews.
Comparing Israel with the
Nazis is deeply moronic,
and accusing British Jews
of being more loyal to
Israel is deeply misguid-
ed. The national executive
committee (NEC) was
right in later accepting
these examples on Sep-
tember 4th. However, it is
unfortunate that in a rush
to resolve this PR disaster,
the Labour party aban-
doned its initially rightful
opposition to the notion
that claiming that the ex-
istence of a State of Israel
is a racist endeavour is an
example of anti-Semitism
and contradicts the right
of Jewish people to their
self determination.
The Labour party was
initially right in recognis-
ing that by adopting this
noted example it would
stifle criticism of the state
of Israel. Were Mahatma
GandhiorNelsonMandela
anti-Semites for opposing
the forcible seizure and
expulsion of Palestinians
form their native lands
because of a colonial fiat?
Arthur Balfour, speaking
for one country promised
the land of another
country to another people.
In the original 1948 UN
partition plan, the Jewish
state received 56% of the
land mass of Mandatory
Palestine whilst Jews
made up less than 32%
of the population. Oppo-
sition to the UN partition
plan and the succeeding
land grabs by Israel
because of war outcomes,
as espoused by the likes
of Noam Chomsky is
not rooted in anti-Sem-
itism but against racial
colonialism. And this in
not merely a historical
debate, but very relevant
in today’s politics in Israel
– with the passage of the
controversial ‘Jewish-na-
tion state law’ in July
which in effect rendered
Arab Israeli citizens to
second-class citizenship.
By not recognising
the deep-rooted racial
prejudice in Israel’s foun-
dation – it minimises the
struggles and pains of the
Palestinian people. Thus,
it is a pity that the Labour
Party has succumbed to
the onslaught of negative
and unfair press coverage
by abandoning its moral
objection in stifling debate
on Israel’s racist policies.
Jeremy Corbyn has
fought against racism
all his life, from fighting
against apartheid in the
1970s and 80s to his
historic commitment to
the Palestinian people
which reflect the actions
of a warrior against
racism. Jeremy Corbyn
(whose ideological heroes
Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky
and Rosa Luxemburg
were great historical
Jews) has always proudly
stood shoulder to shoulder
with his Jewish social-
ist comrades like Jon
Lansman, the founder of
Momentum.
Dame Margaret
Hodge’s hyperbolic claim
that the Labour Party’s
disciplinary process
against her is reminiscent
with 1930s Nazi Germany
belittles the true horrors
of the holocaust. And the
opportunistic Frank Fields
bogus claim that he left
the Labour party because
of anti-Semitism doesn’t
hold its weight when one
looks at his historically
xenophobic opposition to
immigration – this is not a
champion against racism
but a politician who was
facing deselection and
trying save face.
For thousands of years,
Jews have faced untold
misery and suffering,
and it is absolutely right
(and far overdue) that the
Labour party disposes
any anti-Semitic elements
within the party to the
dust-bins of history.
However, it’s vital that
great Jewish faith not be
reduced to a monolith,
consequently criticism of
the state of Israel not be
confused with anti-Semi-
tism. Let us not confuse a
small disgusting minority
with the overwhelmingly
progressive majority.
