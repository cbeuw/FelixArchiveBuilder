In a statement made to
The Guardian, Andrew
Hunter, co-founder of
Adzuna, had this to say:
“Students concerned with
getting the best bang for
their buck should look
outside the traditional
league tables and should
not automatically assume
Oxbridge to be best. For
savvy students looking
ahead to their career these
resources can help make
an informed decision, not
just for their university
enjoyment, but for their
future success.”
All ten of the top
universities for graduate
earnings were Russell
Group universities.
Adzuna’s research is
based on analysis of
155,000 graduate CVs
posted on its site, detail-
ing the average salaries
of these graduates in the
first year after graduating.
Adzuna also claims to
supply labour market data
to the Office of National
Statistics.
