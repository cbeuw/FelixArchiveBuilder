n 2015, David
Cameron achieved
by surprise what no
other Conservative
leader had accomplished
since 1992: he returned to
Westminster with a major-
ity of six. The Tories had
warned the electorate of a
‘coalition of chaos’ aris-
ing around Ed Miliband
if voters returned again a
hung parliament. Three
years later, Labour isn’t in
government, but the chaos
is very much here.
We all know what
happened later. Brexit; a
premiership that looked
solid but was badly
damaged by the supposed-
ly useless Jeremy Corbyn
in an ill thought snap
election; the deal with the
right wing Democratic
Unionists to maintain
power, and the slow death
by a thousand cuts of the
May government. We
left them last June with
the Brexit negotiations in
stall, as the Tories were
deeply divided on the
future relationship they
wanted this country to
have with the European
Union: from the softest
of Brexits advocated by
backbenchers like Anna
Soubry and Dominic
Grieve, to a clean cut
breakup with everything
that ties us to the European
institutions, a position
championed by the likes
of Jacob Rees-Mogg
and the remnants of the
Monday Club.
Since then, the
tribulations inside the
Conservative party have
been centred around the
so-called Chequers plan,
which was designed by
May as compromise
between the two sides
presented above, an
agreement that the now
united Tories could sell to
the EU in order to achieve
an orderly transition and a
negotiated exit. Needless
to say, it proved fruitless.
The EU could never
accept a deal that curtails
one of the freedoms (that
of movement) almost
completely, while schem-
ingly retaining the other
three to variable degrees.
Indeed, the heads of gov-
ernmentoftheEUmember
countries told May quite
bluntly that the plan was
unworkable a week ago.
On the other side, the hard
Brexiteers in Parliament
saw the concessions in
trade and justice issues as
a step too far and refused
to stand by the document.
The problem for May was
that among the Tories
that saw the proposed
agreement as treason to
Brexit voters was her
main negotiator with the
EU, Secretary of State
for Exiting the European
Union David Davis, who
promptly resigned citing
that the UK was yielding
‘too much, too easily’ and
stating that he couldn’t
defend those proposals in
good faith at the negotiat-
ing table. Sensing blood
in the water, Foreign
Secretary Boris Johnson
also announced his resig-
nation soon after that of
his colleague, sinking the
cabinet into disarray.
Johnson has been
seeking the top position
for years, and his latest
tactic in a long history of
political zig-zagging is
drifting hard to the right to
seduce the most extremist
wing of the party, in the
hopes of toppling May
once and for all. Soon
Nonetheless, Johnson
should be wary of other
pretenders to the keys of
Number 10. This summer
several candidates have
been rumoured as May’s
possible successor. The
most talked names have
been those of the new
Foreign Secretary, Jeremy
Hunt, who is known for
leading the Department
of Health during the
austerity driven Cameron
years, and Defence Secre-
tary Gavin Williamson, a
rising star among the Con-
servative ranks who has
been frequently compared
to Frank Underwood, the
Machiavellian character
played by Kevin Spacey in
Netflix’s House of Cards.
As the party grandees head
to Birmingham for their
yearly conference, May’s
position looks shakier
than ever. In addition to
having to fight against a
Labour party that has been
reinvigorated after its own
conference, Chequers is
effectively dead, no matter
what her loyalists say, and
the post conference period
is predicted to be a race to
the top as the different as-
pirants scramble to claim
the unofficial position of
May’s heir presumptive.
Indeed, by this time next
month we may very well
have someone else as the
leader of Her Majesty’s
Government. These are,
indeed, turbulent times for
the Tories.

“Johnson
should be
wary of other
pretenders
to the keys of
Number 10”
after quitting his cabinet
position, he caused con-
troversy by weighting
into the burqa debate with
his characteristic tact by
comparing women that
wear the clothing to ‘bank
robbers’ that look like
‘letter boxes’. He was
condemned by May and
other senior members of
the Conservative party,
but it could arguably be
said that he did not receive
enough criticism from the
media. He cunningly dis-
activated them by offering
tea to the reporters that
were waiting at his garden
for an explanation, while
dressed in a carefully
crafted casual attire. The
row slowly died off as
Johnson continues to plot
against his party boss.

but the chaos
is very much
here”
