Imperial has to offer

Editor-in-Chief
Beit Hall
Beit Hall is a highly
desirable hall mostly due
to its proximity to the
university. Students can
feasibly roll out of bed
with five minutes to spare
and still turn up in time for
lectures. Needless to say,
this almost never happens
and instead most Beit Hall
residents appear at least
10 minutes late, wrapped
in a duvet and rubbing
sleep from their eyes.
Eastside Halls and
Southside Halls
An Eastside student
was recently witnessed
surreptitiously carrying a
carafe of caviar, wiping
blood off their Versace
slippers, having kicked
a commuter on the Pic-
cadilly line for getting
to close to their shoes.
They passed a Southside
student with a chalice of
Champagne. A violent
display ensued when the
Eastsider got caviar on
the Southsiders original
Yeezys. They were last
witnessed prodding one
another’s butlers to fight
whilst screaming, “kill,
kill, kill.”
Parsons House
Parsons House is an
attractive option for many
students due to its excel-
lent amenities. There is a
shopping centre, excellent
travel links to the rest of
London, and plenty of
medics around to look
after you should you
injure yourself on the way
back from sports night...
Pembridge Hall
Pembridge hall is
essentially student battery
farming. There are 96
beds to two kitchens. For
those of you studying
biology, that’s 48 students
per kitchen. In the jungle
of Pembridge, only the
strongest 8 students may
use the hobs at a time,
leaving the rest to furtive-
ly scurry about after the
resultant scraps. Speaking
to a survivor, they claimed
that the experience made
them stronger, despite the
obvious growth defects.
Putney Boathouse
Unfortunately, due to
the extremely broad nature
of the students living at
Putney boathouse, out-
lines of previous residents
can be seen in all of the
doorways. In order to
avoid damaging the boat-
house further, it is rec-
ommended that students
walk around sideways, to
avoid additional drafts.
Wilson House
Unfortunately, there
are no solicitors studying
at Imperial. Soliciting
in general can be found
commonly outside Wilson
at around three in the
morning. Students are
advised not to seek legal
advice from this source.
See a doctor instead.
Woodward Buildings
Costume Store
According to other Im-
perial students, occupants
of Woodward and the
Costume store live so far
away so as to be totally
inaccessible. Residents
of Woodward and the
Costume store report
being treated like social
lepers by residents of
Southside Halls // Imperial College London
other halls. One resident
said “I don’t understand
it, I thought that the
40-minute commute on
the overcrowded Central
Line in temperatures
high enough to kill cows
wouldn’t be a barrier to
our friendship.”
Xenia
Xenia has Woodward to
thank that it is not the fur-
thest away from univer-
sity. Unfortunately, there
is little much else to say
about students at Xenia.
One student reported, “I
met someone from Xenia
once, but I don’t remem-
ber their face. Just a sort
of grey mush.”
