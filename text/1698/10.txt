and the state
itself exist due
to their ability
to marshal large forces
of people to achieve
a common goal. The
modern state was inexora-
ble in its ability to extend
its influence around the
globe, to the point that
where there are humans,
there are now states to
govern them. The nation
state has the capacity to
care and protect or punish
and persecute its citizens.
It is the potential for gov-
ernment tyranny over its
citizens that motivates op-
position to the expansion
of the state. The idea of
what constitutes tyranny
by the state is broad and
can range from actual
physical force being em-
ployed by the state against
its citizens to the act of
taxing a citizen’s wealth
or income. However,
this potential for tyranny
allows states to provide
many vital functions, such
as the enforcement of the
rule of law, the provision
of a safety net for those cit-
izens that are unfortunate
in their circumstances,
and the provision of vital
public goods.
The degree to which
you trust the state, there-
fore, depends on by how
much you think that the
state’s tyranny has the po-
tential to provide benefit
to you and yours, as well
as how the application of
the state’s tyranny aligns
itself with your values.
Nearly everyone ac-
knowledges the potential
of states to produce large
changes within society,
but there are questions
over whether state inter-
vention makes problems
worse, as well as the extent
to which it is the state, not
other social forces, such as
market economics, solve
the problems instead. In
my opinion, despite the
capitulation of many pol-
iticians to market forces
in the modern day, it is
evident from the historical
record of the power of
the state to force social
change. Just looking at
the history of the UK,
obvious examples of state
driven social change come
to mind- redistribution of
clergy lands, provision of
mass education, provision
of a unified infrastructure,
the development of an
independent judiciary, as
well as countless other
small but significant
developments that shaped
the development of the
UK we see today.
In terms of modern
social change, the market
economy is firmly in
control, leading to the
force that is increas-
ingly driving political
resentment and political
re-evaluation: inequality.
The difference between
the wealth held by the
richest and the poorest
has sky-rocketed over the
last 40 years. Despite the
fact that the growth of the
world economy has led
to decreases in poverty
in absolute terms (ish),
the growth in wealth ine-
quality is fundamentally
dangerous to the contin-
ued functionality of the
world’s political systems,
particularly democracies.
In oppressive political
systems, populist move-
ments can be repressed, as
has occurred in many of
the countries involved in
the Arab Spring, as well
as in Hong Kong.
However, in democrat-
ic countries, populism
is a force that can be
utilised for political gain.
They can be seen gaining
momentum everywhere
against the status quo,
whether it is Duterte in
the Philippines, Erdogan
in Turkey, or most sig-
nificantly, Trump in the
US. Populist politicians
are dangerous by dint of
their power base, as the
mob is capricious and will
support policies that may
be viable in the short term
but are unsustainable in
the long term. An excel-
lent example would be
that Trump has simulta-
neously lowered taxes and
prosecution for those that
had driven us to the crisis
point in the first place,
whilst austerity policies
were enacted across many
nations in order to balance
the books. 10 years later,
and the effects of auster-
ity are still being felt by
the most vulnerable in
society, fuelling populist
movements around the
world.
In order to correct this
imbalance in wealth, and
therefore the respective
powers of the masses and
the elites, governments
must become far less
laissez faire. They must
raise taxes to pre-1970s
levels (~70% for the
highest level of income)
and regulate markets
effectively in order to
reduce corruption. They
must stop the privatisation
of areas vital to the public
good, such as education
and healthcare, under
the illusion that it makes
these services better and
more efficient. The only
consequence of privatis-
ing these industries is to
make them more efficient
at generating profit for
the owners, as a perfect
market for these services
cannot develop.
Democratic govern-
ments should no longer
be afraid to lead the
way in redistributing
wealth from the richest
to the poorest. Instead of
relying on charity, which
is reliant on fickle human
kindness at the best of
times, we should choose
to use existing political
structures to shape our
society to be more fair
and just. We can no longer
afford to do otherwise if
we want out democratic
institutions to continue
into the future.

increased spending. The
rise of a populist party can
be prevented by the im-
plementation of sensible
economic policies that
distribute wealth fairly
amongst its citizens.
The fact that this has not
happened is an example
of the consequences when
the elites in a society are
capable of disproportion-
ately influencing govern-
ment economic policy.
The disproportionate
influence of the elites was
never more evident than
at the time of the global
financial crisis. Banks
that collapsed were bailed
out, with limited or no
