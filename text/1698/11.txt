It’s Freshers week and it wouldn’t be right if Grumpy Bastard didn’t welcome you all to

I hope you understand
that when pronounced
correctly, those words
sound “you’re not smart
anymore,” or whatever
“you’re not smart any-
more” is in the language
of your choice. We are,
after all a hugely diverse
community of individuals
from countries all over
the world. You might
have been the best in your
school, at the top of your
class, but you are now
mixing with individuals
that are truly your equal.
Most of you will adapt to
this fairly well, but some,
probably indirect contrib-
utors to r/iamverysmart,
will continue to persist in
the fallacy that they are
still clever. Learn fast, or
it will crush you.
Following this sage
advice, I hope that you
have exploited your fresh-
er’s week to the best of
your ability and mingled
with your peers at the uni
halls of your choice. If
you are a student with the
dubious honour of pos-
sessing a name that is hard
to pronounce, be prepared
for one of two reactions:
either people will butcher
it, and continue to butcher
it for the rest of your life,
or some pedant will insist
on pronouncing it perfect-
ly. The best way of getting
round it is to never tell
anyone your name, and
be eternally referred to as
either that guy or that girl.
For all freshers, I hope
you are fond of the people
that you’ve met over the
last week. Prepare to
abandon them and give
them an embarrassed nod
of recognition every time
you pass them in a small
corridor or rub up against
them in Metric. If you’re
particularly unlucky,
they’ll have taken their
shirt off and rubbed their
sweaty nipples all over
your body. If they’re par-
ticularly unlucky, you’ll
enjoy it.
Ah Metric. That unique
place where collective
social-awkwardness,
either not enough or far
too much alcohol, and not
enough space interact to
produce one of the worst
experiences of your life.
You’ve hopefully had your
first Metric experience
at some point this week.
I’m not sure if they’ll
have unleashed the older
years at the same time as
you yet, but as a Fresher,
beware of sharking. Going
to Metric can occur in a
similar manner to serious
drug abuse. Initially you
will attend out of sheer
the following morning,
the main emotion will
be self-revulsion, but the
hooks are in your brain.
Repeated use will occur,
in some cases creating a
dangerous dependency.
Overall, your expe-
rience of Imperial will
not be determined by the
course you have selected
or the place you live, but
by the people you meet
and the friends you make.
With that in mind, I can
almost guarantee that your
experience will be terrible.
That is the environment
that you create when you
cram all that ambition to
be an investment banker
in one place.
“Use of Metric
will, in some
cases, result in
a dangerous
and highly
destructive
dependency”
social pressure and a
sort of excitement at
experiencing such illicit
pleasures for the first
time. When you wake up
