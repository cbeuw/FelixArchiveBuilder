I’m sure you’ve heard
this enough by now
but, welcome! This is a
difficult university to get
into, and you’ve done
tremendously well getting
this far.
There are many benefits
to studying at Imperial:
it’s a rich, prestigious
London university with
a strong research culture
and some of the world’s
leading academics.
Some of the educational
provisions, such as the
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Programme
(UROP) and the Horizons
Programme, are either
completely absent or far
weaker elsewhere.
Unfortunately, there are
also plenty of issues at our
university. Our student
satisfaction is among the
lowest in the country,
while our counselling
service is so severely
underfunded that some
students have had to wait
over 15 weeks before they
can be seen. Other student
services, including the
cooked breakfast in the
Senior Common Room
and the swimming pool at
St Mary’s hospital, have
been cut, while the mem-
bership cost at Ethos Gym
has been hiked up. At the
same time, Imperial runs
a huge surplus, exceeding
£78m every year for the
past five.
I don’t say any of this to
demoralise you, but rather
to make a point: we can
do something about this.
Very often, we feel pow-
erless when faced with
issues, whether within our
departments or across the
university. You probably
noticed problems at your
school or college that
you had no power to
improve, but university is
different. Students can be,
and should be, more than
passengers in their own
education.
There are so many
ways you can get involved
beyond your studies. You
can join a club and help
foster a sense of com-
munity. You can work
with your department’s
society and get involved
with activities and events
outside your course. You
can also run for election
as a rep (nominations
open September 29th)
and represent your fellow
students on the issues that
matter to you most. The
last of these can often
seem daunting and point-
less, but they can result in
real, tangible changes for
students. As an academic
rep, I was able to in-
troduce undergraduate
teaching assistants to lab
and computing sessions
in my department, in
addition to the existing
postgraduate demonstra-
tors. This means fourth
year students now have
the chance to earn over
£14/hour and freshers
have more support. That
year we also pushed the
university into ending its
zero-tolerance policy on
late coursework, wherein
work submitted even a
minute late would result
in a student losing all the
marks for that assignment.
Rather more excitingly,
a rep in Physics was
recently able to organise
a Pizza Vending machine
for students, which should
be arriving on campus
soon. Students also made
a huge difference during
the nationwide pensions
dispute earlier this year,
where our support for
academic and support
staff helped strengthen
their action, and eventual-
ly helped force Imperial’s
Sciences) which currently
do not have common
rooms. In addition, we’d
like to see wide-reaching
academic decisions that
affect all of us being made
more by students and
academic staff, and less
by senior management.
Finally (for now), in line
with other London uni-
versities, we will also be
pushing the student union
to start paying its bar staff
the London Living Wage.
These are my priorities,
but they needn’t be yours.
Whatever you want to do
at Imperial, you owe it to
yourself to be more than
just a passenger. Whether
there are issues in how
we’re being taught, in
events that are being run,
or just in the vending
machines, rather than
thinking “this sucks! I
wish things were better,”

management to compro-
mise.
These kinds of achieve-
ments might seem out of
reach – that they’re too
ambitious or require some
special knowledge or
ability, but they don’t. All
that’s needed is the belief
that things can change,
and the motivation to see
it through.
This year we – myself
and likeminded people in
theUnion–willbefighting
back on the cynical cuts to
student services discussed
previously. We will also
be working on improving
student space, with a
particular focus on those
departments (such as Life
I believe our refrain
should be “what can we
do to change this?” We
have the power to make
Imperial a better place; if
we truly want to, we can
work together to make it
happen.
