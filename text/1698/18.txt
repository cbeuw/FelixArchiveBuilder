Welcome to the pleasuredome
My friend Kunal from
Singapore calls me the
grime guy. I like the way
that sounds so I don’t
correct him. In truth, as
far as grime or UK rap
goes, I consider myself a
semi-casual listener (you
won’t catch me listening
to anyone less niche than,
like, Ghetts). Though I
stay open to most genres,
US hip-hop is my forte,
while indie rock, electron-
ic and RnB always stay
in heavy rotation. Top 5
bands/artists? Probably
something like Kanye,
OutKast, Frank Ocean,
Radiohead, The National.

Despite growing up
listening to Queen, Bowie
and Duran Duran, my
first album was Beautiful
World by Take That, and
my first gig was Example.
Not the greatest start, I
admit. For Christmas in
2012 a friend of mine gave
me three CDs he thought
I’d like: The Queen is
Dead by the Smiths,
Whatever & Ever Amen
by Ben Folds 5, and The
Velvet Underground &
Nico by, funnily enough,
the Velvet Underground
and Nico. It would be a
cliché to say they changed
my life, so instead I’ll say
they rocked my fucking
world and I never looked
back. - AL
When I was five, I
proudly learnt the words
to ‘21 Seconds’ by So
Solid Crew, and when I
was six I was given my
first album: Stripped by
Christina Aguilera. I don’t
think my musical tastes
have changed much,
except for an angsty
teen detour that had me
explore older English
music and fall in love
with The Beatles, then
David Bowie and finally
The Smiths as I made my
way through the decades.
Now, I just listen to Drake
to be in my feelings. - SK
As much as I pretend
to enjoy whatever’s on,
I only listen to drone,
Mongolian throat singing,
and post-mariachi. I’m
not like these normies.
My appreciation of music
extends infinitely across
the imaginary span like
a Nyquist contour. One
time I heard a car crash and
stopped dead in my tracks,
stunned by the beauty of
the F#dim7add9minus17
the impact screeched out.
jk tho I only ever listen
to Ke$ha. - HE
Get the strap! 50 Cent storms O2 arena
T
he crowd who
turn out to see
the O2 arena stop
of 50 Cent’s Get
Rich or Die Tryin’15th
an-
niversary tour is probably
the most diverse I have
ever seen at a show. Aside
from the Power theme
tune or 50’s Instagram
feed, I’ve been largely
out of touch with his
work for about a decade.
Despite this, tracks from
this album: ‘21 Questions’
and ‘If I Can’t’never stray
far from my most played,
and few songs get a dance
floor filled quicker than
‘In Da Club’ or ‘P.I.M.P.’.
Get Rich or Die Tryin’
is a classic – perhaps
the greatest album of all
time. You take what you
want from it – it has been
praised as a damning
exposé of gang life and
culture, but also criticised
for including misogynis-
tic lyrics and glorifying
violence. Since the album
was released in 2003, its
fans have included those
that have misunderstood
the lyrics entirely. This in-
cludes me and my friends
in the playground at seven
years old trying to work
out where the ‘Candy
Shop’was. Whatever your
perspective on the explicit
content, it is difficult to
argue against the impec-
cable production, flow and
lyricism on the album, or
its colossal legacy.
The show is a party
right from the start. Lethal
Bizzleopensassupportact
and gets eight moshpits on
the go within 10 minutes,
and when 50 Cent makes
his entrance even those sat
at the back of the stadium
are stood up. 20,000
strong, the entire arena
is heaving with energy.
50 Cent is no exception,
and any concerns he may
be too old for this finish
before they have time to
start. It’s a bit awkward
when too many people
don’t pause and instead
scream the n-word at the
top of their lungs, but for
the most part the atmos-
phere is light hearted and
fun despite the subject
matter. 50 wishes he could
play guitar like Prince. “I
can’t do that,” he says,
“But I can do this.”, and
launches into ‘21 Ques-
tions’. There’s little time
to pause and chat – 50
has so many hits he plays
shortened versions of
most songs, only deviat-
ing from his work to play
Bob Marley’s ‘Is This
Love’ and encouraging
the audience to ‘light up’.
Things take a sombre turn,
however, when he halts
the show for a minute’s
silence to honour the
victims of the Grenfell
Tower fire. The minute
is touching, and the O2
is illuminated with green
stage lights and thousands
upon thousands of phone
torches. He segues into
‘Patiently Waiting’, and
the bright spots begin to
sway. I’d be surprised if
any of the audience got
home not feeling like
they’d really enjoyed
themselves. Even I felt
cool, and I’m more ‘Gee,
you knit?’ than G Unit.
Still nifty at 50 //G Unit
