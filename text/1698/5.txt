#LoveNotLandfill has
enlisted the support of
anonymous street artist
Bambi to redesign clothes
banks and encourage
recycling of unwanted
clothes.
The #LoveNotLandfill
campaign, co-funded
by the EU and London
Waste And Recycling
Board (LWARB), aims
to educate young fast
fashion fans on the perils
of throwing unwanted
items of clothing into the
rubbish bin. The cam-
paign will position bright
and eye-catching clothes
banks in busy shopping
locations around London
to make them particularly
accessible for young
fashion lovers.
Hannah Carter from
#LoveNotLandfill says,
“We want people to stop
throwing clothes away
and pass them on instead
to slow down the pace of
fast fashion. We’re not
telling them to stop loving
fashion. We want them to
enjoy their outfits but then
dispose of clothes careful-
ly, because all items have
a second hand value.”
At Freshers' Fair, Felix
will be offering one lucky
fresher the chance to win
a custom tote bag de-
signed by Bambi! Bambi
shot to notoriety when she
created a controversial
mural of Theresa May and
Donald Trump dancing
together, called ‘Lie Lie
Land’. She has created a
striking image of a young
girl holding up a dress
with disdain! This image
has been sprayed onto a
limited number of banks
placed in TopShop’s
Oxford Circus store,
Beyond Retro in Dalston
and Ealing Broadway
Shopping Centre, plus
two more coming later in
September in Westfield’s
shopping centres in Shep-
herd’s Bush and Stratford.
The image is Bambi’s
characteristically tongue-
in-cheek way of encour-
aging young people to use
the clothes banks.
When it comes to
fashion, young Brits love
to shop. Each week, they
buy approx. 4.1 million
items of clothing to stay
up to date with the latest
trends. However, whilst
they grow ever more
stylish, the flip side sees
a massive 35 million
fast fashion items end
up in landfill each year.
The #LoveNotLandfill
campaign recently com-
missioned a nationwide
poll to better understand
the attitude of 16-24 year
olds towards clothing dis-
posal. The results prove
that more must be done
to help them change their
recycling habits.
The majority do not
realise they can put
damaged/stained/faded
clothes into clothes banks,
all of which can be recy-
cled for industrial use.
A massive 63% of under
24 year olds said they
were unaware you could
donate stained clothes and
40% do not recycle faded
items.
Bambi says, “I think
people will be shocked
how many clothes end up
in landfill…. Someone
else may love the clothes
you no longer want.”
The poll also uncovered
a general misconception
of what clothing items
can go into a clothes
bank. For instance, 70%
of respondents assumed
bras would be unwanted,
when in actual fact they
have a high resale value in
many of the international
destinations that UK
clothes are sold to, such
as Africa and Eastern
Europe. The same goes
for fancy dress.
The #LoveNotLandfill
clothing banks will be in
place for a minimum of
six months to Jan 2019.
Additional #LoveNot-
Landfill clothes banks
will be popping up around
London over the coming
months. For updates on
new banks and locations,
