It’s Been a Long Summer in British Politics
Brexit will be a defining moment in British Politics and what has happened over the last few
months could define the outcome of the UK’s negotiations with the EU.

I
t’s been a crazy
summer in the world
of politics with
both major political
parties in major turmoil.
The Conservative party
and the Labour party have
been in open warfare over
Brexit with each other and
within their own camps.
The start of the summer
started well for Theresa
May,shesufferednomajor
defeats in the House of
Commons over her Brexit
plans and was able to get
her Chequers plan agreed
by her Cabinet with little
blowback. The Chequers
plan was designed to be
a compromise between
remain and leave support-
ers with regulatory agree-
ment over goods allowing
frictionless trade whilst
solving the Irish border
problem, however; it has
failed to appeal to either
side of the Brexit debate.
Whilst Cabinet members
Johnson and David Davis
have resigned over the
Chequers plan, this has so
far had few consequences
on Theresa May’s Brexit
plans and it is still the
agreed position of the
Cabinet with both remain-
ers and Brexiteers in her
Cabinet publicly backing
the plan.
This was as good as
it would get for Theresa
May. She’s been facing
open revolt over her
plans from the European
Research Group, a group
of Eurosceptic Conserv-
ative MPs, who believe
the deal would leave the
UK in the worst possible
position on accepting
EU rules on goods but
unable to influence these
rules after leaving the
EU. This group would
prefer to see the UK
leave with a simple free
trade agreement where
both countries agree to
reduce tariffs over goods,
but this could reduce
overall trade with the EU
compared to the current
settlement. However, this
would make it easier to
strike new trade deals
with other countries such
as the USA, which would
be much more difficult
under the Chequers plan.
The European Research
Group (ERG) is about
40-60 MPs strong and
would in all likelihood be
able to scupper any deal
that Theresa May brings
back to Parliament that
even vaguely resembles
Chequers if they were to
vote against it. There are
only two ways Theresa
May could get her plan
through Parliament; one
would be to appeal to a
select number of Labour
MPs to vote for her plan
in order to avoid leaving
the EU without a deal.
The other way to garner
support is to turn any vote
on May’s Brexit plans into
a vote of no confidence in
her government. It would
then be a choice between
triggering a general
election where Corbyn’s
Labour could win power
or vote for the deal.
Theresa May’s plans
were also dealt a heavy
blow by the EU. They
have come out to say that
they believe her plan to
be unworkable and that
it would undermine the
integrity of the EU single
market. This was a much
stronger rebuke to her
plans than she had antic-
ipated and provoked a
pointedly angry response
from the PM. The
EU’s plans for the Irish
backstop have proved
unpalatable to the UK
government as they would
see Northern Ireland enter
into a different arrange-
ment so that there would
be no need for border
checks on the island of
Ireland. This would result
in checks being made
between Northern Ireland
and the rest of the UK if
there were no deal and ac-
cording to some would be
the economic annexation
of Northern Ireland from
the rest of the UK; this
would most significantly
include unionist DUP
MPs who May relies on in
order to gain a majority in
Parliament following her
botched general election
of 2017.
The Labour party’s
position on Brexit is as
divided as the Conserva-
tives. In this way Labour
are fortunate they do not
have to deliver Brexit
as these divisions would
become all the more
apparent under the kind of
scrutiny any government
would face over Brexit.
This has been exemplified
by the recent row over
option to remain could be
one of the options on the
ballot paper but Labour’s
Shadow Chancellor cate-
gorically ruling this out.
Labour have spelled out
six tests which any Brexit
plan must meet in order
for them to vote for it; one
of these tests state that the
UK should have the same
benefits after Brexit as we
do before it. This is clearly
unachievable under any
Brexit deal. Beyond these
six tests Labour has failed
to give much more detail
as to their Brexit plans
and Labour’s solution to
Brexit thus far has been
to be as ambiguous as
possible on their Brexit
policy. With Brexit
nearing and the Labour
conference under way
this position will become
harder and harder to
maintain.
Where we will be come
March 2019 when we
leave the EU is anyone’s
guess. If Theresa May is
able to convince the EU,
remainers and Brexiteers
in Parliament to agree to
her deal then this would
be bordering on mirac-
ulous. Both Labour and
the Conservatives have
been severely challenged
by Brexit and how they
manage the next few
months could shape the
future of the UK for a
generation.

there has been agreement
