Flutes, Flights and Fire-Breathing Dragons

ragons, lakes,
and music.
These three
words defined
the event of the summer
that everyone in IC Wind
Band had been looking
forward to. This year,
Wind Band went further
than we’ve ever ventured
before, touring in the
(mostly) sunny land of
Slovenia.
Slovenia’s capital city,
Ljubljana, was a welcome
sight for the poor souls
who volunteered to drive
for two days to get there.
Luckily, it wasn’t just
because they’d spent two
days in a sweaty minibus
– it was a lovely sight for
the clever people who
decided to fly there, too.
We arrived at the hostel,
unpacked our instruments
and equipment into our
rehearsal room, and got to
exploring.
Ljubljana, we discov-
ered, was originally a
Roman city. It has all the
obligatory ruins to go with
it, mostly housed inside
their city museum. It also
has a strong association
with dragons, specifically
a dragon that was slain
in the Ljubljana marshes
by Jason, of Argonautical
fame. This means that
various dragon-themed
decorations – bridges,
statues, plushies – are
pretty commonplace
throughout the city.
Ljubljana is a castle
town. The castle sits on
the top of a fairly steep
hill, though exactly how
steep differed based on
whether you asked the
people who walked up the
hill or the people who took
the funicular. The castle
itself is medieval, with
a tall viewing tower that
gave us splendid views of
the city and surrounding
area. Some of us even
attempted the castle’s
‘escape room’, in which
we successfully saved the
Ljubljana dragon from the
abyss beneath the castle.
Aside from the castle,
and the impressive
Dragon Bridge over the
Ljubljanica river, we also
admired the Prešeren
square, St. Nicholas’s
Cathedral, and the oldest
McDonald’s in Slovenia.
Overall, we agreed that
Ljubljana was a pretty
ace city, especially when
accounting for their tasty
food, ice cream, and €3
bottles of rdeče vino.
Despite all the sightsee-
ing, we managed to fit in
some excellent rehearsal
time for the three concerts
we had lined up. Two of
our concerts took place at
a bandstand in Congress
Square, a small park
located in the city centre.
We played a selection of
film themes including
Pirates of the Caribbean
and The Incredibles, as
well as modern concert
band tunes, all of which
were incredibly well-re-
ceived. The rain during
our second concert didn’t
perturb our devoted
audience, simply prompt-
ing some listeners to sit
on the grass under their
umbrellas. Our final per-
formance was cut slightly
short by a thunderstorm
partway through Moment
for Morricone, scaring off
even the most tenacious
members of the audience.
Overall, the reception at
Congress Square was ex-
cellent, and it was a lovely
place to play.
Our third concert was
at Bar Prulček, a cool
live music venue. Wind
Band played fabulously
there too, albeit on a
very cramped and stuffy
stage! The concert was
live-streamed out into the
beer garden where the bar
customers enjoyed the
music at a more bearable
temperature. After a short
interval, the Swing Band
(a sub-group of our band)
wowed the crowds with
some jazz classics, and
had more than a few on-
lookers tapping their feet.
Finally, we took a day
off to relax and visit the
beautiful Lake Bled. At
only an hour’s bus ride
from the city, Bled was
absolutely worth the visit.
The water was stunningly
blue, and the sun shone
all day long. Some of us
rented rowboats to reach
the island in the centre
of the lake, while others
enjoyed a refreshing
IC Wind Band takes Slovenia by storm!

swim on the west side of
the lake. We all agreed
that we’d never been
swimming in such a
beautiful setting. Drying
off in the sunshine, sur-
rounded by clear water
and hilly mountains, was
the perfect cherry on top.
Ljubljana was a fantas-
tic place for Wind Band’s
tour this year, and well
worth the journey. Our
three concerts were a huge
success, and – if tour was
anything to go by – Wind
Band is set to have the
best year of music, perfor-
mance, and fun that we’ve
had so far.
