U.S. Yield Curve Analysis
A
new analysis
predicts that the
U.S. Treasury
two-year bond
yield is set to overcome
the U.S. Treasury ten-year
bond yield between the
beginning of November
2018 and the end of
January 2019 - most likely
in December 2018.
This analysis suggests
that, with a 95% con-
fidence interval using
simultaneous observation
bounds, an inversion of
the U.S. yield curve is
likely to happen between
31 Oct 2018 and 25 Jan
2019 if the current trend is
maintained. The thinnest
confidence interval,
using non-simultaneous
functional bands, predicts
an inversion of the yield
curve between 09 Dec
2018 and 17 Dec 2018.
The x-intercept is set for
13 Dec 2018.
The U.S. yield curve
corresponds to the U.S.
sovereign bonds’ yields
against their respective
maturity. A normal yield
curve shows that short-
term bonds have lower
interest returns than
long-term bonds, while
an inverted yield curve
exposes the fact that
short-term bonds have
higher interest returns
than long-term bonds.
You can find below the
four possible bounds used
for this research. The blue
dots represent the spread
between the U.S. Treasury
ten-year and two-year
bond yields, data courtesy
of the St Louis U.S.
Federal Reserve.
The fitting line was
found with a correlation
coefficient squared of
r2=0.9234, this is adjusted
to the degrees of freedom
generated by the model.
The inversion intervals
are given as follows
according to the different
bounds: Note that these
intervals work provided
that the trend since
February 2018 is holding
until inversion.
The data also provides
an average rate of change
of the spread between the
ten-year and two-year
yields, given at -0.58%
on a daily basis, proving
inversion.
Some argue that the
quick inversion of the
U.S. yield curve is due
to the U.S. Treasury’s
decision to stop extending
the weighted average
maturity of its issuance,
the anchoring effect of low
long-term global rates,
and the ability for U.S.
corporations to currently
deduct pension contribu-
tions at the 2017 tax rate
of 39% rather than the
new 20% tax rate, leading
to a rush to buy long-dated
bonds. Others believe that
it is mainly due to the U.S.
government and corporate
debts which have reached
peak levels of 2007.
The yield curve is a
powerful indicator of U.S.
recessions, including the
subprime mortgage crisis
in 2008-2009. Investors
are more willing to switch
their investment to risk-
free assets since short-
term bonds offer higher
yields when the curve is
flat or inverted. There has
always been a recession
within 17 months fol-
lowing the inversion of
the U.S. yield curve - the
most significant being
the 2008 crisis as it was
made late due to the huge
insurance bond market
(which products include
the Collateralised Debt
Obligations and Credit
Default Swaps) which
was 20 times bigger than
the underlying bond
market.
Commercial Cannabis: Bitcoin Bubble?
O
n Tuesday 18th
S e p t e m b e r ,
the US Drug
Enforcement
Agency gave the
Canadian cannabis pro-
ducer Tilray permission
to export its cannabis
to the United States for
medical research. The
next day Tilray Inc. shares
were halted five times
from trading in less than
one hour as the market
neared its close. After
being the first marijuana
company to go public on
the NASDAQ Exchange
earlier this year with an
opening share price of
$17, the company was
trading at a record high
of $300 that Wednesday
– a daily gain of 94%
and an increase of more
than 400% in the past
month! The company
is now worth more than
a high number of large
cap companies including
American Airlines and
pharmaceutical company
Mylan. The Vancouver
based company, accord-
ing to its website, “is a
global leader in medical
cannabis research,
cultivation, processing
and distribution”.
This type of activity sig-
nals great investor expec-
tation of future growth in
this lucrative industry. Even
Coca-Cola is researching the
market for cannabis-related
products. ArcView Market
Research and its research
partner BDS Analytics see
that over the next ten years
the legalisation of marijua-
na will see much progress
around the world. Despite
Tilray’s revenues of just
$20 million in 2017 the up-
coming legalisation of mar-
ijuana in Canada means its
business potential has dra-
matically increased. Addi-
tionally, consumer spending
on legal cannabis in North
America is expected to rise
from $9.2 Billion in 2017 to
$47.3 billion a decade lat-
er. However, the worldwide
recreational cannabis market
remains contained by the
U.N.’s Single Convention
on Narcotic Drugs. ArcView
think that not much can be
done to change U.N. attuides
until the US Government
federally legalize the drug,
which ArcView’s CEO, Troy
Dayton, believes will happen
potentially after the 2020
presidential election. Never-
theless, there is still a huge
potential market for medical
use of marijuana especially
in Europe. With a health care
spending budget of $1.3 tril-
lion, European government
subsidised health care insti-
tutions can potentially bring
the medical cannabis market
to become the largest in the
world (Italy is expected to
have $1.2 billion in sales by
2027).
Don’t think though this is
risk free, investing in canna-
bis remains precarious. Til-
ray’s recent market activity
has drawn comparisons to
the swings Bitcoin expe-
rienced at the end of 2017.
“It’s like the supply and de-
mand that drove Bitcoin up,”
Jason Spatafora says, “it’s
just limited supply and over
demand”. Leslie Bocksorm,
who has invested in multiple
cannabis companies, thinks
that from a fundamental fi-
nancial perspective there is
no justification for Tilray’s
current valuation. Howev-
er, he said the short sellers
could have it wrong and Til-
ray may be the Amazon of
the cannabis industry; “Only
time will tell”.
