College Union
announced it would now
be serving breakfast in
FiveSixEight, ahead of
the new academic year.
A year on from the
widely unpopular decision
to scrap breakfast in the
Senior Common Room
(SCR), students and staff
alike can now enjoy a
delicious breakfast in the
Union. This change comes
amongst a slew of recent
changes to the Com-
mercial Services offered
on campus, including
changes to the cost of
access to Imperial's sports
centre, Ethos (as reported
by Felix in July).
The Union breakfast
menu is divided into
two sections, a “Grab
& Go” menu and a “Sit
& Graze” menu. As
the name suggests, the
“Grab & Go” menu is
intended for students
who want to “grab some
food quickly before they
go to lectures”, while the
Sit & Graze menu allows
for those with spare time
to “sit down… chat with
their friends, socialise”
and more.
The whole menu is
available for anyone
sitting down to eat, i.e.
food from the “Grab and
Go” menu is still avail-
able to eat-in. However,
anyone wanting to order
food to take away will
only be able to do so from
the “Grab & Go” menu.
Felix caught up with
Claudia Carabello, the
Deputy President (Fi-
nancial Services), who
explained the Union’s
decision to start offering
breakfast:
“We started breakfast
because SCR stopped
breakfast; that was a
College decision… it was
making a big loss, yet
students really wanted
11.30 am and “Grab &
Go” items available from
8 am to 11.30.am. As the
breakfast is still on a trial

breakfast provision. We
looked into whether it
was reasonable for us to
do it, which it was, so we
started it!”
Plans for the Union
to offer breakfast began
back in March with the
chef and Julia Mattingley,
the Head of Commercial
services.
The “Grab & Go”
service is allegedly much
quicker than normal
service. Claudia con-
firmed this, commenting
the following:
“I ordered a breakfast
muffin, which I would
highly recommend;
delicious! That took
me 7 minutes to get my
order and apparently that
was one of the slowest
orders of the day. Others
were getting theirs in 2-3
minutes… I was really
impressed with how quick
"Grab & Go" works.”
The Union breakfast
is being offered on a trial
basis, with items from
the “Sit and Graze” menu
available from 10 am to
