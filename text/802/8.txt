Yes! The Saturday of the FA Cup
Final is upon us once again where two
teams and their respective faithful
gather by the shadows of those
famous twin towers to battle out the
'Final Tie' of the greatest and oldest
football competition in the world.
This year it is the turn of Liverpool
and Wimbledon to step out onto the
Wembley turf and savour the
atmosphere of a lifetime.
Liverpool
So much has been said, seen and
written about Liverpool this season
that a few paragraphs can't really do
them justice. They are already league
champions and Wimbledon alone
prevent them from completing their
second double in three years. In goal
is the extrovert Bruce Grobbelaar,
sometimes brilliant, sometimes
reckless. The defence will be chosen
from such blockers as Scottish
international Alan Hansen, Gary
Gillespie, Nigel Spackman from
Chelsea and a man who has come
through the ranks (shock, horror,
surprise) Gary Ablett. The midfield
and attack is where Liverpool really
show their class. Ray Houghton, a
£700,000 buy from Oxford and a
once free transfer from West Ham,
looks confident. Big scoring
sharpshooter and penalty man John
Aldridge has filled the gap left by
Rush. England man Peter Beardsley
has been a revelation, who will forget
that goal against Everton? New
master Steve McMahon, a midfield
genius with a new lease of life.
Footballer of the year John Barnes is
pure class. He had been living on his
goal against Brazil for years but is
now an England certainty. Craig
Johnston, the curly Aussie and Jan
Molby the scouse Dane are also in
contention. With players like Barry
Venison and Ronnie Whelan as back-
ups, the squad looks very strong.
The man in charge is Kenny 'sorry,
can you repeat that please?' Dalglish.
He is down as a player-manager but
is now content to sit on the bench
while his men do the business on the
field. They haven't had an easy
passage to Wembley with victories
over Stoke (after an away scoreless
draw), Everton, Aston Villa (away),
Manchester City (away) and a tough
tussle with Nottingham Forest at
Hillsborough. The main man to watch
is Barnes. If he conjurs up his magic,
they could be unstoppable.
Wimbledon
Twelve years is a long time in football
and a progression from non-league to
Division One and now Wembley is
quite staggering. It is their first FA
Cup Final and nerves will be jangling.
In goal is the captain and all four
divisions man Dave Beasant, a highly
paid player who leads from the back.
In defence they have ex-Argyle man
Clive Goodyear, little Terry Phelan
and ex-Brighton player Eric Young
who recently reduced Pompey
goalkeeper Alan Knight's face to a
disaster area. There is also the Psycho
Vinny Jones, the man-to-man marker
who Paul Gascoigne of Newcastle got
very intimate with. Under 21 star
Andy Thorn completes the rearguard.
The midfield and attack mixes flair
with true grit. Alan Cork has been
there since the beginning of time.
Terry Gibson, the ex-Coventry and
Man Utd man, plays his part after a
record £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 transfer. There is
Lawrie Sanchez from Reading and the
class little 5'6" Denis Wise, the man
with little hair and a big heart. The
hit man (no pun intended) is John
Fashanu, the £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 ex-Millwall
front man and amateur boxer. The
back-up men include Brian Gayle,
Carlton Fairweather (let's hope it is)
and ex-England, Real Madrid and
WBA star Lawrie Cunningham.
The men in charge are Bobby
Gould, the much travelled player
turned manager, and his sidekick Don
Howe, with a club who appreciates
him now. Their route to the final has
been a mixed bag. Victories over
WBA (a later goal burst), Mansfield
(away), Newcastle (away), Watford
(after being down at half time) and
Luton at White Hart Lane after also
being 1-0 down. (Denis Wise netting
the winner.) The main men to watch
are Wise and Fashanu, if they sparkle
the Wombles could pull it off.
On paper it looks a very good final
with the perfect match of Champions
and underdogs. The second string
love Wembley, who can forget
Sunderland, Southampton, Ipswich,
West Ham or last year's wonder
heroes Coventry? This may tip the
balance and as I predicted the Dons
to win from Round Three and the fact
that they have the guts required, I am
going for a Wimbledon victory after
extra time or even a replay. Sit back
in your armchairs this Saturday, open
a can of your favourite tipple and
savour the atmosphere. You can even
throw a toilet roll at the TV to feel
that you are really there! For overseas
students, this is our big day so join
in and sample the true English way
of life.
Yours for the last time,
Adrian A B Grainger.

It's the middle of May on the French
Riviera. Film stars, directors,
producers and Barry Normans are
looking for something to do on
Sunday afternoon in between
watching the latest offerings at the
Cannes Film Festival. Why not nip
down the coast a few miles to Prince
Rainier's place and watch some motor
racing?
That is, in essence, the story behind
the Monaco Grand Prix, or is the
racing the story behind the posing?
Monte Carlo in May is one of the
places to be seen on the European
social circuit and as such attracts a
different type of crowd from the
normal Grand Prix. The sponsors
love the place and bring guests galore,
all hoping to see their cars succeed.
This puts extra pressure on teams and
drivers—not as if they needed any
more, for this is the oldest surviving
street course on the World
Championship calendar. The circuit
winds its way around the principality
in a tortuous two mile ribbon, past the
famous Hotel de Paris, the Casino,
the Mirabeau Hotel, through the
tunnel under Loews Hotel, around the
harbour and the hairpin at La
Rascasse Restaurant.
There are two schools of thought
about the relative performances of the
turbos and atmos on this very slow
(85mph) circuit. One is that the
greater agility and lighter weight of
the atmos will give them the edge,
whereas some think that the low fuel
consumption on this circuit will free
the turbos to use more of their power.
I'll go for a compromise—the best of
the atmos will be better than the
turbos—except the McLarens. The
big question is: can anyone end the
McLaren domination of this season so
far?
Alain Prost leads the Championship
on fifteen points with team mate
Ayrton Senna next up on nine. Prost
won three consecutive Monaco GPs
but Senna won last year in the actively
suspended Lotus-Honda. It should be
a classic struggle—two great drivers
in clearly superior cars fighting
amongst themselves. Qualifying and
the start will be all important. If one
of them gets through the Virage Ste
Devote first with the other behind
other cars then the race will be as
good as over. The most likely
inteloper is Nigel Mansell, always
heroically fast on the streets, but with
a question mark over the reliability
of his Judd V8 engines. His Williams
team mate Riccardo Patrese (winner
in '82) should also be well up, but I
don't expect the Benettons to show as
well as they did at Imola. Rory
Byrne's chassis have never gone as
well on street courses as on road
courses and drivers Routsen and
Nannini have yet to show any
outstanding streetcraft. Expect the
Marches of Ivan Capelli and Mauricio
Eugelmin to be the other leading
atmos.
Head on the block time again: Prost
to win, Patrese top atmo. After the
BBC's debacle with the San Marino
GPI am assured that the race will be
shown live on Sunday Grandstand,
starting at 2.30pm.
Over in the States, motorsport and
the month of May mean one thing—
the Indianapolis 500. This Sunday
sees the start of qualifying when pole
positions will be decided. The race
itself on May 29 will be watched by
400,000 people making it the world's
biggest sporting event. More details
in two weeks time.

Firstly, Shan sends his apologies.
Unfortunately, he has been hit by the
love bug, leaving me to write his
column.
Saturday saw Kalyasi win what was
supposed to be a Derby trial.
However, the main contender,
Alwuhush was withdrawn before the
off. Apart from the Derby, the other
classic which looks exciting is the
Oaks. One of the nags fancied is
Diminuendo. This left the field
standing at the two-furlong marker,
and was slowing down as it passed the
post.
This weekend, the Irish 2000
Guineas sees a showdown between
two of this classic's top horses;
Caerwent, who was disappointing in
the English equivalent of this
prestigious race; and Emmson who
will not be suited by the soft ground.
Hopefully, next week I can give
you my tip for the Derby. Until then,
this week's tips appear in the news
pages.
