C&G MOTOR
Last Friday thirty members of the
City and Guilds College Motor Club
took the Cooper Racing Services
introductory course in motor racing
at the Castle Combe circuit in
Wiltshire.
First of all dirvers attended a
briefing in the circuit control tower,
there the instructor showed the correct
racing line around the circuit,
indicating breaking, turning in and
gear change points. It was emphasised
that the key to a quick lap time was
smoothness and using the full width
of the circuit.
Then it was onto the track for
individual attention. The instructor
drove you around for two laps in a
Ford Escort XR3i or Orion 1.6i,
demonstrating what had been
explained earlier. The pupil then took
over the controls and had three laps
to learn the circuit and prove his
competence to progress. The
instructors were very helpful in these
laps, pointing out faults as they
occured enabling them to be corrected
straight away. Then came the
highlight of the day—seven laps in a
race-prepared works Formula Ford
(FF) 1600 car. This is the type of car
used by almost the very junior drivers
as they start their motor racing
careers. As the name suggests, they
are equipped with Ford 1600cc
engines, producing about 105bhp,
four speed Hewland gearboxes, a
tubular spaceframe chassis and
Dunlop control tyres. Top speeds
were about lOOmph because we were
asked to keep to a 5000rpm limit, but
the impression of speed is much
greater because of the directness of
the steering and the stiffness of the
suspension.
Everyone thoroughly enjoyed
themselves and another trip will be
organised next year, anyone
interested should get in touch with
C & G Motor Club via the Guilds
Office.
IC RADIO
Starting from Monday May 9, from
8am to 9.15am, a new era starts in
IC Radio broadcasting history. The
immaculate partnership of Spenser
'Fast' Lane and Neil 'Trouser' Press
is sure to bring an element of mirth
into your Monday mornings. So, by
tuning into 999kHz on the medium
wave band (which is even audible
from Garden Hall, so who is
spreading these vicious rumours about
not being able to get it in Southside).
ICSO
Robert Manasse, a 3rd Year Applied
Biology student, is probably one of
the most talented people ever to study
at Imperial College. He was born in
New York in 1932 and at the age of
21 discovered the secret of eternal
youth.
Apart from being an excellent
biologist, he has also composed the
soundtrack for, arid starred as
Harrison Ford, in such films as 'Star
Wars', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and
'ET'. He represented Wales and the
British Lions at full back for ten years
and he knits his own jumpers.
This evening, at 8pm in the Great
Hall, IC Symphony Orchestra is
privileged enough to have Robert
performing Reinecke's Flute
Concerto with them. He will be
playing a flute presented to him by
Winston Churchill in recognition of
his service in the Battle of Britain.
The Orchestra will also be performing
three of Robert's pieces: Music from
'Star Wars', 'Carmen' and 'Peterloo'
which he wrote at the age of eight
months. Tickets are £ 1 . 5 0 ( £ 1
advance) for students and £ 2 . 5 0 for
grown ups.
MICROLIGHT
Have you ever wanted to fly? Have
you ever had that urge, drawing you
to the open skies and wondered what
it's like being up there? Unfortunately
normal powered flight costs so much
as to be out of reach of most people's
pockets. Microlight aviation is cheap
and fun. Microlighting is also not
very hard, if you can learn to ride a
bicycle you can learn to fly a
microlight. This is helped by the
inherent stability of the weight shift
control trainers: one of the weirdest
sensations is taking your hands off all
of the controls and finding nothing
happens (microlights are less affected
by weather than other forms of light
aviation). Nothing can beat putting
full throttle on charging down a field
and then disappearing off into the
heavens.
The most expensive part of
microlighting is the licence, which
costs a few hundred pounds spread
over a few months but after that
microlighting is the second cheapest
form of powered transport after the
moped. Microlighting at Imperial's
first job will be renovating the
College microlight to an airworthy
condition and as the end of exams and
the summer months come up it should
be a lot of fun. Anyone interested in
microlighting at IC should contact Hal
Calamvokis (Aero 1 or Rag
pigeonholes) or Chris Tipper (EE1).

TENNIS
U A U 1st Round
Saturday May 7
IC vs City at Harlington
Hopeful to improve upon last year's
quarter final place in the U A U , the
Imperial College 1st team got off to
a good start this season defeating a
strong City University side 5-4.
City's American 2nd pair took time
in adjusting to the superb grass courts
that Imperial boast at Harlington,
dropping the 1st set to Hill and
Lavelle before narrowly winning in
3 sets. At the end of the first round
Imperial were down 2-1 as Jones and
Roberts lost to City's strong 1st
couple and Morcos and Skipworth
won against City's 3rd pair.
The match score stood at 3-2 to
Imperial when Morcos and Skipworth
lost a marathon match against the City
1st couple 3-6, 6-4, 15-13 after
holding a match point. In the final
round, needing to win 2 out of the 3
remaining matches Imperial scraped
home victorious.
Julian Jones and John Roberts look
like developing into a very formidable
pair, although their combined height
of 11 feet leaves them vulnerable to
tactical lobbing. The new partnership
of Hill and Lavelle demonstrates the
depth of talent in the IC Tennis Club,
coasting against City's equivalent
couple before losing narrowly to the
vociferous American 2nd couple. It
was left to Morcos and Skipworth in
the deciding match of the day against
the Americans to demonstrate the
finer points of grass court tennis and
take the match 6-2, 6-0.
The result guarantees IC a place in
the U A U knock-out rounds regardless
of the result of our match this
Wednesday against UCL.
RIFLE & PISTOL
Always in search of new challenges
the pistol team took up standard
pistol, an Olympic discipline not
normally shot at IC. As some match
practice was needed before the
BUSEF competition at the end of term
we challenged the Central Polytechnic
of London to a match on March 4.
Standard pistol is a timed discipline
with a string of 5 shots taken in 150,
20 and 10 second. These are repeated
4 times for each time period. This
gives an individual score out of 600
and in this competition the best 4
scores out of 6 were to count.
The teams, in the order they shot,
were:
IC Central Poly
Paul Deeks Michael Wolf
Ian Draper Rob Silverstone
Andrew Jones Robin Razzel
Mike Lacey Pete Kershaw
Andrew Lane Adrian Mitchell
Roger Winskill Ross
After introductions, and a late arrival
by Ross (who didn't have time to tell
us his other name), tha shooting
began.
Some good scores were shot by
Central Poly, their best by Siberstone
at 331, gave them an overall score of
1209. These were, however, well
beaten by an impressive IC total of
2050 with the best score of 521 from
Roger Winskill. A bout of eratic
shooting meant their best was almost
as good as our worst but a good team
performance gave counting scores all
over 500.
After such an emphatic win (again)
we look forward to a return match
soon. Finally we are still looking for
members and welcome anyone, come
down to the range any lunchtime to
join. Also if any of our members
know of any reasonably good clubs
around London we can challenge
come down and let us know.
