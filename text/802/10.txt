Classical Music
Hello again! Due to the overwhelming
indifference shown to my first article
I had to plead, wheedle and buy
drinks for the FELIX hierarchy
(where was mine?—Ed) to be allowed
to write another and to stop being
replaced by an article on the spawning
habits of the Mongolian tree frog.
Right, now for the music. Now is
a great time to go to hear classical
music in London. The great part of
the world's top fiddle players have,
or are about to, descend on the capital
in conjunction with the L S O
International Violin Series.
In the week ahead you will be able
to hear Beethoven, Creig, Elgar,
Tchaikovski, Rackmaninov and
Debussy.
Tonight at 7.45pm at the Barbican
the LSO have a rich bill—the star
attraction of which must be the
Tchaikovski Violin Concerto in D
Major.
This is a major work with a
wonderful, intensely sad subject in its
first movement and all kinds of
breathtaking scales. The second
movement is full of retrospection and
wistfullness. It is typical
Tchaikovski—even its happiest
moments are introspective and
regretful of what might have been.
The third movement flies along and
requires nimble and quick
fingerwork.
Sunday May 15 sees another great
Tchaikovski/Mussorzky/Rackmani-
nov programme at the Barbican. The
LSO play Night on the Blue
Mountain. The all famous
Rackmaninov Piano Concerto No 2
and the real star Tchaikovski's
Symphony No 6 in B minor.
It is impossible to preview all the
concerts but I have highlighted the
best. The star concert this week is the
LSO performance of Beethoven's
Triple Concerto in C major featuring
the brother/sister/sister trio of Myung
Whun Chung, Kyung Sha Chung and
Myung Wha Chung. The piece was
an unprecedented achievement in
orchestration, allowing all
instruments to be heard irrespective
of their very different tones. The
orchestra is almost redundant in some
places as the three solo instruments
play as a trio in their own right and
in places trying to outdo each other
in the first movement. The second and
third movement blend wonderfully
into one another with 'cello starting
and finishing the second.
Also appearing on the same bill is
Mahler Symphony No 1 'Titan'
which in my opinion is brilliant.
Matthew Salter.
