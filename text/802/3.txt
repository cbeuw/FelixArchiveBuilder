ULU Library
occupation
success
The University of London Library at
Senate House was occupied overnight
on Tuesday by students from several
University Schools. The
demonstration, organised by the
University of London Union (ULU),
was in protest against plans to
severely cut central library facilities,
and had the support of the library
staff.
The University is considering
moving all Science and Medicine texts
from the Senate House library and
turning it into a reference-only, Arts
and Humanities library. It was felt
that this would not, as claimed, save
the University money, and would
mean undergraduates would lose
access to a considerable number of the
University's books.
24 Imperial students attended the
'work-in' of which 15 stayed all
night, including ICU President
Sydney Harbour-Bridge, External
Affairs Officer Neil Motteram and a
STOIC film crew. IC was the best
represented of all the colleges present.
The 'work-in' began with a meeting
of around 150 students addressed by
ULU Chairperson-elect Randall
Smith and U L U President John
Tilsed. There were guest speakers
5
from Middlesex Poly who are
presently in indefinite occupation of
several of their sites. The meeting
passed a motion declaring support for
Middlesex action. During the night
attempts were made by some, more
extreme members of the U L U Exec,
to extend the protest or to take some
radical action in the morning, but
these were defeated by the organising
committee.
ULU President John Tilsed called
the protest a '...resounding success'.
He thanked students from Imperial for
their support and asked them to attend
a lobby of Senate over the issue next
Wednesday at Senate House, at
3.30pm
Birbeck College Union opened its
Snack Bar for the protester's breakfast
at 7 o'clock Wednesday morning. The
protest ended with a considerably
smaller meeting at 8.00am which
voted to support the lobby of Senate
and to look at other ways of keeping
the campaign running.

The Department of Employment has
started a new campaign encouraging
small firms to employ graduates with
a strong strain of individuality. The
campaign is associated with the
Manpower Services Commission
initiative to persuade higher education
institutions to introduce a more
enterprising approach to the
curriculum so that undergraduates of
all disciplines gain experience in skills
relevant to the business world.
As part of the campaign three
booklets have been published which
are available from the Department of
Small Firms Centres, Jobcentres and
Enterprise agencies.
STOIC
censured
The Student Television of Imperial
College, STOIC, has been censured
by Publications Board following the
purchase of a new camera. The Board
agreed that STOIC had misled a
previous meeting so that it would
allow the camera to be bought.
Bursaries still
available
There are still some Old Centralian
bursaries available for summer
employment under the UROP
scheme. These are restricted to City
& Guilds students but can be held for
work in any department. Each
bursary pays half the cost of your
employment up to a maximum of
£375. The usual UROP research
project lasts for ten weeks during the
summer vacation and the
recommended maximum bursary is
£75 per week. No tax or National
Insurance contributions are
payable—you get the full amount and
overseas students do not need a work
permit.
To apply for a bursary you need to
find yourself a Supervisor who is
looking for a summer student. The
UROP Directory lists all the projects
on offer and you can get a copy from
your Departmental Vacation Training
Officer or from Mrs Wendy Ibsen,
Room 713, Elec Eng.
There are no similar bursaries on
offer for non-Guilds students, due to
the lack of interest shown by the RCS
and RSM alumni associations.
However, it is possible for a
Supervisor to apply for a Nuffield
Foundation grant. If your potential
Supervisor pleads poverty try
suggesting that he makes a Nuffield
application—details available from
Prof J C -Anderson, Elec Eng.
