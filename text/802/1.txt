LIFE SCIENCES STUDENT SERIOUSLY ILL
Meningitis Scare
New RCSU Exec initiated
A Life Sciences student was taken by ambulance to St Mary's Hospital
on Monday with Meningococcal Meningitis after having been found
unwell at home. Meningitis is an inflammation of the brain lining which
can affect the brain, being caused by several different types of germs.
One of the most serious bacterial types is Meningococcal Menningitis,
the strain in the recent outbreak in Gloucestershire, which caused 158
deaths in the 1,090 cases reported in 1987.
The germ lives naturally in the back
of the throat and is spread like colds
by droplet transmission when
coughing, leading to flu-like
symptoms, a severe headache
worsened by movement, a stiff neck,
discomfort from bright light and
sometimes a rash from associated
septicaemia. Treatment is immediate
hospitalisation with intraveneous
antibiotics.
The present case is most likely to
be an isolated one, according to the
Health Centre, as most secondary
cases are reported within four days,
though the incubation period is two
to ten days. Who catches the disease
is dependent on an individual's
susceptibility with household contacts
only slightly more in danger, and
social contacts such as classmates no
more at risk than anybody else.
As required by the Public Health
Act the case has been notified to the
Local Medical Officer for
Environmental Health. The Health
Centre has spoken to the affected
student's class and distributed a notice
throughout the College. Four to five
people have discussed the symptoms
with their doctors but none were
found to be infected, and it is felt
there is no need for concern.
The Life Sciences Office is in
contact with the intensive care unit at
St Mary's and was told there had been
a slight improvement in the student's
condition on Thursday although he
was still very ill.
