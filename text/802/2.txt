FELIX
I was listening to a report on the radio
yesterday which detailed the results
of an extensive survey into the values
of 18-28 year olds. I think that most
of us fit into that category. It
concluded that Mrs Thatcher's
'Victorian' values are back and that
we were all being far too sensible
about life.
The average 18-28 year old
practises safe sex and believes in
monogomous relationships: his views
are slightly right of centre and he
sounds as boring as hell. 'Today's
young has turned its back on the
Sixties', proclaimed the reporter.
'Today's young plays it safe'. I had
to agree with him and I had to identify
with Mr Average 18-28 year old. But
aren't we all missing something.
I always believed that growing up,
maturing, call it what you will, was
something that you did by your own
experience. We all have to burn our
fingers before we learn not to touch
the fire. Our generation, however,
has grown up to be the unquestioning
generation. We believe what we are
fed by the Government, media and
even our parents, then we make our
own conclusions from the information
we have been given. All we want out
of life is enough money for luxuries,
our own homes and somebody to
love. We may occasionally collect a
little money for Rag, go to a charity
concert, give to the RSPCA, but we
don't seem to care for others or give
them our precious time.
I don't remember much about the
Sixties but I certainly prefer their
values to those of the Eighties. I feel
I've missed something while
practising safe sex and planning for
my future. Do you?
Puppet on a string
I feel really sorry for Sydney
Harbour-Bridge. He tries so hard to
make everybody like him. A few do
until they find out how easily led the
poor dear is. All this year he has
allowed himself to be manipulated by
a few key people who make all his
decisions for him, give him his ideas
and tell him what a naughty boy he
is if he talks to FELIX.
Last week I received a telephone
call from one of the Union Bar
Licensees. He said that he would
appreciate it if nothing was published
concerning the Snack Bar or Union
Bar losses and that he was asking on
behalf of Mr Harbour-Bridge. But
Syd gave me an hour and a half
interview that night where we
carefully went over exactly what I
could publish. I checked every fact he
gave me twice. I also spoke to Alan
Rose. I then published the story in the
FELIX flysheet.
Next day Syd was severely
reprimanded by individuals who have
no place to give advice, or to say that
they speak in the best interest of the
Union. He has decided not to tell any
member of FELIX staff any more
details concerning this; unpleasant
situation.
However, last Friday he^Mye a
very detailed interview tp Broadsheet
Editor Dave Smedley on whifcjwave
based his lead story this week. The
story, purporting to bethe actual truth
was entirely the 'truth'; according to
Harbour-Bridge. I have spoken to
most concerned and they all say that
they were never approached by Mr
Smedley for an interview'. How can
RCSU allow their newspaper to be
used in such a blatant propoganda
campaign? And why was Broadsheet
covering an Imperial College Union
news story anyway?
Dave accused me in his editorial of
'effectively create(ing) news at the
expense of people'. Strong words but
are they really justified? I asked the
people who I'm accused of using.
None of us could see any news that
I had 'created' at their expense. So
what's Dave getting at? I shall in turn
accuse Dave of distorting viewpoints,
printing one-sided news stories and
being used to further the aims of the
puppet and his puppet masters.
Annual Reports
I was very disappointed that neither
the President nor the Deputy
President presented annual reports
this week. I hope that the Annual
General Meeting next Thursday will
insist that both reports are circulated
in FELIX at a date in the near future
so that we can all see exactly what
both sabbaticals have done for us this
year.
Turn Up!
Please come to the Annual General
Meeting of the Union next week and
question your Union officers about the
past year.

got a U in Physics? I didn't until
Wednesday night.
