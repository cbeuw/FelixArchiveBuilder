Executive
relieve Deputy
President
Imperial College Union Deputy
President Alan Rose has been relieved
of his duties relating to the running
of the Union Snack Bar and Bar
following a decision made by the ICU
Executive. The meeting found Mr
Rose to be 'responsible for gross
mismanagement with relation to a
number of his duties as Deputy
President relating to Union trading
outlets'.
Mr Rose has responded to these
allegations of mismanagement in an
open letter which has been distributed
inside every copy of FELIX. In it he
states that 'the decision of the
Executive Committee to back the
recommendation of the self-styled
'investigation committee' in the
removal of the Bar and catering
activities from my (his) remit implies
an instrumental responsibility for the
apparent stock shortages, experienced
by both outlets. This is a position
which I (he) cannot accept.'
The Executive Committee has
decided that Mr Rose should not have
any more to do with the Union's
trading outlets. Mr Rose is still
looking after the Union's finance, the
Union Building and Mike, the IC
mascot.
Both Snack Bar Manager Norman
Jardine and his deputy Mark
Anderson decided not to turn up to
their Union hearings earlier this week
following legal advice. Mr Anderson
told FELIX that both he and Mr
Jardine are still unsure as to why they
are being aslced to attend the hearing.
He said that he wasn't being
uncooperative with the Union, he just
wanted everything in writing before
he attended any inquiry.
Union President Sydney Harbour-
Bridge has arranged another meeting
for this afternoon but Mr Anderson
says that he will not attend until he
has a written list of questions and
allegations so that he can in turn
provide a written statement regarding
his actions during his time working
in the Union Snack Bar.
Mr Harbour-Bridge was too busy
to comment on the situation when he
was approached by FELIX yesterday.
New Union Barman appointed
The Union's new Bar Manager, John Greaves, working hard in the Bar
after his appointment this week. Mr Greaves, a Bristol City supporter,
is a graduate of SSEES and was formerly Head Cellarman at the Savoy
Hotel. He has also worked for ULU and the DHSS.
Richard has
his balls
pinched
Snooker Club Chairman Richard
Wiles is fuming following the
disappearance of his balls. Mr Wiles,
almost 21, told FELIX yesterday that
he had lost two sets of balls this year
alone.
Last year Mr Wiles locked up his
balls in the Snooker cupboard but
when he unlocked it this year 'there
were only two sets of balls!' He had
assumed that the Club Treasurer, a
postgraduate, could have been playing
with his balls over the Summer but
the Treasurer naturally denied this.
Mr Wiles said that each set of balls
cost in the region of £40 to replace.
He has appealed for his balls to be
returned and has promised that 'no
questions will be asked'.
AGM togo
ahead
The Imperial College Union Annual
General Meeting will take place at
1.00pm Thursday in the Junior
Common Room despite attempts to
postpone it at last week's Executive
Committee meeting. Union President
Sydney Harbour-Bridge wanted the
meeting to be put back until the matter
of the Union trading outlets had been
resolved. The Committee decided,
however, that next week was the best
time for an A G M and that it would
interfere with most people's exams if
it was postponed.
Waller wins
election
Mr Andrew Waller, a first year
Physicist, has been elected to RCSU
Bookshop Representative by a
landslide victory over current SCC
Chair David Clements. Dan Pluta and
Paul Wilmott were returned
unopposed as Theta Bearers.
