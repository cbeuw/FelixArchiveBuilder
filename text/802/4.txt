Guilds
May Ball
Balls and Dinner & Dances are some
of the more dignified events held at
College. The annual Engineers'
Dinner & Dance held at one of
London's top hotels always sells out
(in this year's case in 36 hours). It
was decided last year that City &
Guilds should hold a second Dinner
& Dance, out of the West End, on not
such a large scale as the Engineers'
Ball, which would mean it would be
substantially cheaper. Our aim was to
cater for those members of IC who
feel that Dinner & Dances are just a
little too expensive, and for those who
missed out on getting a ticket to the
Engineers' Ball.
The result of our aim is the May
Ball. The Ball is being held on Friday
May 20 at the Carnarvon Hotel,
Ealing Common. This is a four star
hotel where the food is excellent.
The itinery for the evening is:
Friday May 20
5.30pm Sherry reception.
6.00pm Coaches leave.
7.00pm Coaches arrive. Hotel
bar open.
8.00 Sit down.

A gastronomic
survey of the world
This week's column is guest written
by Olivier Waser who is studying
at Imperial but lives in France.
It is often said that eating in Paris is
expensive; now let me show you that
it is not true. The first spot which
comes to everybody's mind is the
Latin Quarter, a place where you will
find most Parisian students. Lately the
place; has become invaded by
fashionable shops but you will still
find great places to eat especially near
the Metro St Michel where all the
North African restaurants are located.
Go into one of them and ask for a
'couscous', a really stuffy dish
composed of semolina, chilly sauce,
vegetables, veal, chicken and chilly
sausages, in fact it is so substantial
that you will get chock-a-block quite
easily. While we are on the 'Arab
orientated' food try the Lebanese
restaurant situated in the Rue Sauton
(Haubert Hautualite tube station). It
is a take-away restaurant but instead
of taking-away soggy French fries
you can enjoy great local food. Even
if it is not French food you can't
ignore it because Paris is a multi-
racial city. Now let's talk French
food! If you have 'un creux' (empty
stomach) then go to a Boulangerie
(you'll always find one within 5
minutes walking distance from where
you are) and eat croisants aux
amandes, pain aux raisins, tartelettes
aux fruits, eclairs au chocolat or a
selection of savouries such as
sandwiche erudite or quiche lorraine.
If you want to find a good cafe with
a nice 'ambiance' and local people try
'le Marais' in the 12th
arrondissement. Try to avoid modern
brasseries especially those near 'Le
Champs Elysees where everything is
expensive. Now to finish here is a list
of some great inexpensive restaurants:
Chez Chartier: Rue Montmartre.
Here you will get 'cuisine familiale'
for about 30 Francs, but be careful-
meals are not served after 9pm.
La Fresque: 100 Rue Rambuteau
(near Les Halles). Only for lunch, for
about 50F you'll get a main course
with meat and sauce.'
Le Petit Vatel: Rue Lobineau
(behind St Germaine market). The
story goes like this: Vatel was the
cook of Louis XVI and he killed
himself because of a sauce that he
made which that tasted horrible. The
restaurant's like a big kitchen and
there's only one table so it's easy to
make friends. You might have to
queue to get a seat but it's worth it
because the cost is 50F for a whole
meal.
Les Artists: At the corner of Rue de
Siene. Just ask for Tarte Tatin it is the
greatest in the world.
Now remember that service is
included in the bill.
Bon Appetit,
Olivier Waser.
