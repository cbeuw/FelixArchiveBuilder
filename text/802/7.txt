FILM
A Prayer for the Dying (15)
The major problem with making films
about Northern Ireland and its
troubles is how not to side too
heavily, and hence avoid alienating a
large part of your audience
immediately.
This is overcome in A Prayer for
the Dying, the new film from Mike
Hodges (director of Flash Gordon and
Morons from Outer Space), in the
very simple and effective way. The
Irish connection is left very low key,
almost as subtle background to the
events which the film portrays.
Starring as the IRA partisan Martin
Fallon is Mickey Rourke {Barfly,
Angel Heart), cast brilliantly in the
part which could have been written
for him. The film opens with Fallon
inadvertantly killing a bus load of
schoolchildren—the single violent act
which convinces him to leave Ireland
for good.
That's where Alan Bates (The
Entertainer) comes in. He plays
London gangland boss Jack Meehan,
operating a drugs and prostitution
syndicate using a funeral director's
business as a cover. Meehan offers
passage to America, a passport and
cash, but only if Fallon will carry out
a hit on one of his rivals.
Fallon agrees reluctantly and wipes
the guy out while he is visiting his
Prince of Darkness (18)
God exists, and it can be scientifically
proved. This is the stunning
revelation presented to us in the new
film by John Carpenter The Prince of
Darkness. God exists in all things at
a subatomic level, and this results in
the strange concepts of Quantum
Physics. Also, just as there are
particles and anti-particles, there's a
God and an anti-God.
A priest (Donald Pleasance)
summons a group of graduate students
and scientists to an abandoned church
to probe the secrets of a mysterious
cannister. With the cannister they find
an alternative bible (like an alternative
prospectus) which tells things as they
really were. Apparently the bible we
all know, was just something for those
simple people who didn't know what
calculus was. But now 2000 years
later we know about Quantum
Mechanics and so the real truths can
be explained to us.
mother's grave. The murder is
witnessed by Father DaCosta, an ex-
SAS officer turned priest, played by
Bob Hoskins (Mona Lisa, The Long
Good Friday). From then on the story
plods along at a steady pace,
developing into quite a thrilling
climax.
The film is based on a book by Jack
Higgins (The Eagle Has Landed,
Exocet) and the author claims a
hidden narrative in all his books—
the eternal questions about the nature
of man. This theme is clearly evident
in A Prayer for the Dying as the
emptiness which appears when
you've reched your peak. Mickey
Rourke shows this in his character,
revealing himself layer by layer in a
display of fine acting. He explains his
thoughts to Bob Hoskins from the
pulpit in a short exchange which is
The manuscript explains that Satan,
the Prince of Darkness, is entombed
within the cannister, and it sets out
to prove scientifically with a series of
differential equations that what Jesus
said 2000 year ago was true. This is
a bit much for the students to take in,
but they also have to contend with
being individually killed off or
zombified because it just so happens
that Satan, after seven million years
confinement, decides that this is the
time to escape and so effect the
coming of his father, the anti-God.
Prince of Darkness marks another
venture into horror films for John
Carpenter (Halloween, Christine),
and here he takes his science very
seriously. But in the end the use of
the strangeness of Quantum Reality
as a basis for supernatural behaviour
serves as just a vehicle for a rather
routine horror film. There are some
nice spine-tingling touches, but the
delivered with a sad finality. 'There's
nothing worth killing for, and there's
nothing worth dying for, but the real
truth is there's nothing worth living
for either.' The confusion in.** le the
character is much like that of Harry
Angel in Angel Heart.
Bob Hoskins is not my first choice
for a priest (typecasting perhaps?) and
inevitably his performance is not
equal to his part in Mona Lisa but he
does well playing a character very
similar to Rourke's. Alan Bates is
quietly menacing as Meehan.
Younger brother Billy Meehan,
sadistically and psychotically
portrayed by Christopher Fulford,
provides a character who you'll love
to hate, and enjoy the sickening way
Rourke deals with him.
The other characters, father
DaCosta's blind niece Anna, and two
IRA members sent to catch or kill
Fallon provide a little more depth to
the plot if not to their roles.
A Prayer for the Dying is quite a
sad yet enjoyable film, not being
heavily political, and is worth seeing
if only for Mickey Rourke. It opens
tonight at the Leicester Square
Theatre.
acting is mostly dreadful and
unconvincing (or is it that scientists
really do act that way?).
Ultimately it is in the silly physics
and theology that the fun in the film
lies as it happily explains away life,
religion and....everything, in one fell
swoop.

MUSIC
Aliens Ate My Buick
Thomas Dolby
Aliens Ate My Buick is the sort of
thing that could easily achieve cult
status if enough people get to hear of
it. It is, in fact, the latest album from
Thomas Dolby, and is definitely the
sort of album that reaches out and
grabs you. The cover is a mixture of
sixties style film hoarding, Monty-
Phython style cartoons, and Flash
Gordon style melodrama. One of the
unchanging features of rock groups
is how seriously most of them take
themselves and their music. This
criticism certainly stops short of
Thomas Dolby, whose latest album is
a series of musical send-ups, with
hilarious lyrics, and a wide variety of
musical styles. The Key to Her
Ferrari sounds like big-band jazz,
sending up people who fall in love
with their car, whilst Airhead and Hot
Sauce have a viciously funky bass,
and are about women who just refuse
to be liberated. Ever heard a road-drill
on a record before? Rounding up with
the aetherial Budapest by Blimp, here
is an album which displays more
imagination than anything I've ever
bought before.
