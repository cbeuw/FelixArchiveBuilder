THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 6th, 1956
E V E R Y FORTNIGHT
??? U N I O N OPENING ???
As non-freshers are already aware, the
Union i s awaiting eagerly the opening of
new premises i n Prince Consort Road. Last
June the Union was informed that the hulk
of the building would he ready by October
1 s t , but i t soon became apparent to those
watching the progress c l o s e l y that there
would be some delay, caused (we are told)
by labour shortages and t e c h n i c a l
d i f f i c u l t i e s .
The l a t e s t news concerning the
opening Of the new b u i l d i n g i s subject to
such incredible and nerve-racking
f l u c t u a t i o n that i t i s impossible to
publish a d e f i n i t e schedule at t h i s
stage.
At a "take-over meeting" on 25th
September, attended by the Rector, the
Pro-Rector, the Clerk to the Governors,
the Head of the Planning Department,
the Refectory Manager and the present
and past Presidents of I.C.U. i t was
decided that the Lower Refectory could
be opened on Monday, October 8 t h and
the remainder of the b u i l d i n g (except
the gymnasium and Upper Refectory) on
October 2 3 r d . The President of I.C.
was asked to impart this happy news to
the studentsj and the f r o n t page of
F e l i x was o r i g i n a l l y devoted to t h i s .
Yet, such i s the apparent
d i f f i c u l t y of adhering to a b u i l d i n g
schedule, that s i x days l a t e r t M s
programme had to be r a d i c a l l y altered.
Not only d i d the contractors declare
that i t had become impossible to open
the bulk of the building on October
23rd but, f a r more serious, the
scheduled opening of the Lower
Refectory was endangered.
Fortunately a f r a n t i c journey
across west London enabled the front
page of F e l i x to be re-captured from
the p r i n t e r s and s u i t a b l y amended.
At the time of writing (.October
4th) i t i s s t i l l not known whether the
Lower Refectory can be opened on the
f i r s t day of term. Meanwhile the
following r e f e c t o r i e s w i l l do t h e i r
very best to cope with increased
numbers:-
1.
2.
Ayrton H a l l (Unwin B u i l d i n g ) .
Refectory under the Imperial
I n s t i t u t e b u i l d i n g .
3. I.C.Snack Bar (Beit Building).
Notices w i l l be posted i n every
department and i n the temporary (!)
Union giving the l a t e s t news about
the Lower Refectory and the r e s t of
the b u i l d i n g . Meanwhile the Union
centre w i l l have to remain i n the
Unwin b u i l d i n g .
Those who went away i n June
expecting to f i n d a shining new
Union on t h e i r return w i l l be
disappointed at the delay,which
we can only hope w i l l not be
prolonged. A r e a l i s t i c guess at
the date of moving into the bulk
of the Union building seems to be
about mid-November.
The completion of the Union building
w i l l represent a big step forward towards
bringing a proper U n i v e r s i t y atmosphere
to the l i v e s of I.C.students. However,
only when living- near college can a
student obtain the f u l l b e n e f i t of a
University career, and plans f o r an
even more important advance - the
p r o v i s i o n of more hostel accommodation
- have now matured. The College has
acquired three sides of Prince's
Gardens (adjoining E x h i b i t i o n Road).
Demolition of the existing structures
of the East and South sides should
begin shortly and i t i s hoped that
accommodation f o r about 450 students
w i l l be ready i n three years' time.
Meanwhile, a small but very welcome
extension of the present h o s t e l -
involving 25 extra rooms - should be
f i n i s h e d by Christmas.
