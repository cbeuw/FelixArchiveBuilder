An athletic team from I.C. toured the Oslo area of
Norway during the vacation. At the time of going to
press a f u l l report had not been made available to our
Sports Editor and what we know of the tour we have
gleaned from scraps of conversation.
As with all I.C. tours abroad, this tour was most
successful, both from the athletic and social point of
view. To publish the assorted tales we have heard would
detract from the value of a first hand account whioh
should appear in next edition.

The Mountaineering Club holds a strong position
in I.C. sporting and social life. At present some of
this strength may be attributed to the interest cre-
ated by the projected Karakoram Expedition next Sum-
mer. Everyone in the Karakoram party, whioh is being
led by Eric Sbipton, will need mountaineering ability.
We understand that there will be a General Meet-
ing and Illustrated Talk by Dennis Kemp on Monday Oct.
15th. The title will be "Mountaineering, Climbing and
Caving." On the 20th. and 21st. of this month there
will be a Freshers' Climbing Meet in North Wales.

Owing to the delay in completing the Union gym-
nasium, the Boxing Club will be holding joint meetings
with the University of London Boxing Club at the U.L.U.
gym. in Malet St. Training sessions with tuition by
Charlie Elliot are held at the following times:
Monday: 8.00 - 9.30 p.m.
Thursday: 5.30 - 7.00 p.m.
and will oommenoe on the 11th. October. Novices of a l l
weights are welcome and will no doubt be amply reward-
ed, for, as freshers will learn to their costs, folk
are apt to be press-ganged into competing in the Rec-
tor's Cup tournament whioh is held at the end of the
Spring Term.

The Boat Club have sent us no report for
this issue. We can, however, divulge that they
did not do as well as usual at Henley this
Summer. Also, we regret to report that the
Captain-Elect, Paul Harding, pranged once more
and has l e f t us for good.

The Rugger Club has worn the U.L. Oup four times i a
the last five years. This year, as well as winning the
Line out in last year's cup final when we beat
U.C. 6-0.

p again (we hope), we are touring Cornwall at
Easter when we are playing Penryn, Fz, & N.and Falmouth.
We hope to maintain the high standard of the olub by
blending the talents of the freshers with the experience
of the 'old lags'. Apart from their prowess on the
field, the rugger olub are seoond only to the Cricket
Club in their sociability after the game.
We run six Fifteens, so there is room for all who
wish to play. - If i t is sport you want, join the
Rugger Club - and the I.C. definition of 'sport* will
become more apparent as your stay in I.C. lengthens.

stay considerably S)

The soccer club hope for an improvement on last
season, when I.C.'s record was only moderate although
we were only narrowly beaten i n the 3emi-final of the
U. L. Cup. This improvement can be achieved i f players
make a 3erious endeavour to get themselves match f i t .
Competition for positions in the 1st. XI w i l l be keen
and fitness w i l l be necessary f o r selection
It i s hoped that as many freshers as possible
will turn up to the trials at Harlington. Selection
of outstanding players from about 100 freshers is
very difficult after only two trials and therefore
anyone who believes he should have an immediate place
in the tst. XI should not be discouraged i f he is
selected for the lower teams initially. The Club
will run four teams regularly throughout the season,
each competing in the University League.
This year i t is the turn of the Soooer Club for
a foreign tour. The destination has not yet been
decided, but all participants will be assured of an
enjoyable time.
