"The best time to influence
Government policy is before
it's been decided."

"Top-up fees? It's a really bad
idea - I'm against it."
Clare Short MP
Top-Up Fees. Maintenance Grants. Student Loans.
The Government is currently trying to work out a new funding
system for university teaching and student support - the results
are due to be published in January 2003.
If you feel strongly about increased tuition fees, a graduate tax or
the re-introduction of student grants, the best way to have a posi-
tive effect on the Government's new policy is to write to your local
Member of Parliament (MP).
