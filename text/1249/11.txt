Your Letters
King James Managed...
Dear Will,
I note that Sir Derek Roberts,
the current UCL Provost, has
decided to give up on academia
and go back into retirement.
Maybe our Rector should apply for
the UCL job and simply run both
institutions from Sherfield?

PS. Let's not forget that Sykes
didn't manage to merge
GlaxoWellcome with SmithKline
on his first attempt - maybe we'll
see the second installment of "IC
Attempts to take over UCL" in
about three years.
Stop Yer Whingin'
My go for a bit of a rant!
I am writing this in response to
the letter in your previous issue
slating the union and it's posters. I
feel that many of those comments
were unjust and that perhaps the
author if they have such a prob-
lem with the union should reveal
themselves and speak to the
Entertainment and Marketing
teams in the Union Offices...(hint
hint).
Yes, I work at the Union. Yes I
am a DJ there. And yes, there is a
cheese night once or twice a
week. However... there are also
other nights which are not cheese
and if you read the posters you
would know this. This Friday is
the launch of the RnB, Garage and
Hip Hop night, and next term will
hopefully see the start of the
Thursday Drum and Bass/Dance
nights. And the Christmas
Carnival will have a big name DJ
down and a large dance room.
There is a retro 70s Disco night
(which actually plays a whole
night of retro disco) and the
Paradise Bar has been completely
rebranded and is worth checking
out if you ever get the time - with
funk, jazz and soul playing or good
chilled-out dance. There are
theme nights (school disco and
james bond hopefully) and the
occasional pop charts nights.
I understand my bias towards it
is obvious, however, we are all
working towards one goal here
and that is to give people what
they want from their Union. If you
have suggestions or ideas for
nights your comments are more
than welcome - speak to the Ents
team - but slating nights is coun-
terproductive, as you achieve
nothing by it. We seriously wel-
come your suggestions and would
appreciate constructive criticism.
If you have the time to slate sure-
ly you have the time to come up
with good suggestions!
I am only a first year so do not
know what the union was like in
previous years but it has a new
manager - a Drum and Bass DJ
who runs a room at Bedrock @
Heaven who is slowly trying to
rebrand the Union and change
things for the better. I see that you
can get annoyed if your posters
are taken down but the Union's
posters are put up in such large
quantity because so many people
tear them down or put posters
over them. The people who put
11
them up are specifically asked not
to cover recent posters and 9
times out of 10 this is the case!
(well, we all make mistakes...) It
is usually other societies that pull
down posters and the clearance of
the walkway is not done by us (a
lot of our posters get taken down
too...)
And as for minibuses... there
would be more if people didn't
keep running them off the road...!
The marketing budget has no
bearing on the money required to
fix them!
If you do have CONSTRUCTIVE
criticism please send your ideas to
ents@ic.ac.uk Thanks!
Nikki (IC Union DJ)
And Finally
Will,
Are you dumb or something?
Everyone with any ounce of sense
clearly knows that Bo' is a boy car,
and not a girl car. Distinguishable
due to the infinitely more phallic
exhaust pipe.

Ray Peacock was born last centry in Yorkshire where he still lives. After
being made redundant in the late eighties he open his own butchers
shop, where he became a master butcher despite having no knowledge
to this day of 'which bit he is cutting'. He retired from Butchery in the late
90's (leaving the shop in the charge of his son Darren who was unable
to gain employment elsewhere on account of being 'backward').
He sprung into to public prominance in his notorious bid to become
mayor of London, With his campaign slogan "Bringing warm Northern
sensiblities into **** Southern lives".
Ray started in the Comedy Zone, which was a sell-out show at this
year's Edinburgh Festival and now tours the length and breadth of the
land with his unique, informal chats - playing to sell-out crowds. Always
controversal - always unpredictable - and always - telling it like it is....
