You're at University! You're free,
anything is possible, no parents, no
family, none of the shackles of that
place that you used to live. This is
London, Baby, land of opportunity,
most happening centre on the plan-
et, place of freedom; kick off your
shoes, relax your feet and lay back.
It's different now, you make the
decisions, you write the rules.
Question: where does church fit
into all of this? Actually, more
importantly, where does God fit into
all of this?
Lots of people reading this proba-
bly call themselves Christian in
some way shape or form, and as
such, God and therefore Church
play or have played some part in
their life.
So where does this fit in your
'new' life?
An often spoken phrase is 'Show
me your friends, and I'll tell you
who you are'. This can also be said
like: 'Show me your five closest
friends / the people you spend most
of your time around, and I'll tell you
a lot about the life you are living'.
And that says a lot about what
church is.
If you call yourself a Christian,
you can't do it by yourself. You need
other Christians around you in a
real way. To read and pray is not
enough, and what's more, you
become like the people you hang
around with. Not to say you only
ever hang around Christians, but
you need to be around them.
All this said, church does not
make you Christian, it however pro-
vides a family. We as Christians
need a family. Someone to pray for
us, to encourage us, to pull us up
when we are down, to make us see
more of how great God is.
Hopefully you know now why you
need to be in a church, and more
importantly, you feel the need. You
want to be in a church.
The second problem is actually
choosing a church to go to. In truth,
London has got many brilliant
churches, so what to do? How do
you choose one? Do you have to
choose one?
Here's a couple of pointers:

Do look around, but don't look
forever. The temptation can be to
stick with the first place you come
across, don't settle for convenience,
look at the different ones you could
end up in. On the other hand,
spending your time at university flit-
ting from church to church will get
you nowhere. You eventually have
to choose one place.
When looking, look for Family. A
place where you feel at home. Ask
yourself: are there people at this
church that you feel you can get
along with? After all without people
the church cannot exist and that
can be one of the biggest contribut-
ing factors to whether or not you
feel at home.
Pay a lot of attention to the teach-
ing. Look for teaching that you
agree with, a good start is to exam-
ine their statement of faith. This
always reveals a lot.
Think Vision! Does the church
have vision? i.e where they are
going and what they intend doing.
You will be going where the church
is going, so it is important that you
know whether that is where you
want to go.
Check out the worship. What's
your flava? Happy clappy,
Hymnbooks and Organs,
Somewhere in between? Do you
feel comfortable in the way the
church expresses worship to God? If
not, would you like to? Worship is a
very important part of our walk with
God, and the church you join can
have a great effect on your worship.
And the most important factor:
go to the place that God wants for
you. It is worth looking and holding
on for. God doesn't force you, he
will not send you to a place that is
going to do you no good, he will put
you where you will find out the
most about him and get closer to
him, so ask him to show you.
Don't join some cult (there's
some out there). What do we
mean? Some churches have char-
acteristics like claiming to be the
only true Christians, an "If you're
not in our church, you're going to
hell" attitude. Another trait is a
reluctance to let you go.
The following is Daphne's story of
finding the church God meant for
her in London. This illustrates many
of the points that have been raised.
See if you can spot them.
After coming to England to study,
I got involved with a church. A
bible-based, definitely Christian
church, passionate about living for
God. I got involved, made a lot of
friends. The church I was in back
home then informed me that there
was another church in London that
was of the same family as my home
church. This wouldn't have made
much of a difference, but I knew
that my church back home was
where I had been put by God for his
reasons. The knowledge that the
family I had was extended over here
left me with a dilemma. To stay
where I was: I had friends, I was
involved, I loved it, or to go to where
I felt God was calling me to. I mean
after all, one church is as good as
the next, it's the same God we
serve, why does it matter which one
I go to? Also, if I left where I was,
what would happen to all the
friends I made? Would they under-
stand? Would they think I was just
betraying them? It was all too
much, and so for a while I did noth-
ing. I just kept on as usual, but I
didn't feel entirely happy. I knew
there was something I was ignoring.
After speaking to my close friends
about it, I eventually attended a
service at the other church. From
the moment I walked through the
door, it felt like home. This is where
I belonged. I knew this is what I'd
been bothered about, and I knew
what I had to do. So, I am now in
the church that I believe God has
put me in, and it's wonderful. As for
my fears about my friends, they
were not founded. They are still my
friends, they are happy that I've
found the place God wants for me.
All in all, I'm glad I took the step
and went where God wanted me.
We hope this has been helpful to
you. If you need to speak to some-
one about finding a church or any-
thing Christian, contact: john.her-
mes@ic.ac.uk (His People), chap-
laincyÂ©^.ac.uk (Chaplaincy), con-

(Christian Union).
We pray that you will soon be in
a church enjoying everything that
God brought you to this great city
for.
