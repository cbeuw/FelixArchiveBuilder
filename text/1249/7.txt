Wye 'Sup
Charity Week 2002
Greetings again Londoners. Since
I last did a little article, I've had
exactly... let me count... one item
sent to me to put in and even that
didn't reach my email. I think this
must be tainted. Anyway, before I
get started, I have some ranting to
do. The last article I wrote didn't
have my name attached to it. And
that annoyed me somewhat. So
this time, instead of waiting to be
missed out again, I'm going to tell
you who I am. I am Beci. There
we go! Wasn't that difficult now,
was it? There's a good little
Editor.
Right. Down to it. We've just
had our Charity Week (or Rag
Week to some). This year it was
for two fantastic causes, namely
Kent Air Ambulance and the
Cambridge University Department
for Brain Tumour Research. Both
of these causes have supported
ex-students of ours, one of whom,
Ed Notts, sadly passed away
recently.
The week started with a rather
wet bang. We had our traditional
Bonfire and Fireworks. This took
place on the Crown, a (yes, you
guessed it) crown carved into the
North Downs. This was complete-
ly lit up with hundreds of
scrounged industrial-sized baked
bean cans, that Sarah (our Union
Vice President) had been trying to
get hold of for days. As you've
probably realised from the first
sentence though, the weather
was complete pants. The Torch
Procession was a soggy traipse up
the hill, watching people set trees
and each other alight, then we all
huddled together in the name of
charity to watch the fireworks.
Having said that, they were good
and our thanks go to the guys
from 153 (Ben, Henry, Charmer
and Adam) as well as Dave (!)
and Mike (Hunt) West in the fore-
ground, as well as all those little
people in the background. You
know who you are.
Monday night was our Charity
and Salve Auction (Muhahaha!!!).
The highlights had to be JT's
chest waxing (we know it hurt
really), Charmer buying his bat-
tered old car back for Â£1.5 mil-
lion and the (lucky) slaves being
auctioned for a bit of dosh. Good
going guys.
Tuesday's Tug of War was
rained off (I wasn't going out in
that if someone paid me), but we
probably wouldn't have made it
anyway (well, I wouldn't have).
This is because of Tuesday morn-
ing. Champagne Breakfast. What
a wonderful idea. Having been to
a car park for last year's, we did-
n't have a lot to beat. But, none
the less, it was bloody brilliant. At
6 in the morning, we were all
piled on two coaches with no idea
where we were off to. Turned out,
we were headed to a dry ski
slope, so by 7o'clock we were
sledging down the piste, cham-
pagne bottles in hands. The best
had to be the JSF (dressed as
Santas for the week) going down
butts open, the Garters (dressed
as Superwomen) flying down
cape open or Fish going down in
full James Bond stylee, legs
crossed, drinking champagne and
coming to a gentle stop at the
bottom. Best injury for this week,
goes to Hettie who broke her toe
and giggled the whole way to hos-
pital in an Ambulance.
Accompanying her was Adam
Hansen who attempted to slash
his wrists on the slope, but failed
due to our faithful First Aider in a
luminous jacket (yes, Lee, that's
you as he reads this over my
shoulder). Special mentions have
to go to Little Bex and Sarah for
organising it and coming back to
pick up yours truly when the
coaches left me behind, also the
canteen ladies in Withersdane for
doing all the egg and bacon
sarnies which were lovely at that
time after a good bottle or two of
champers.
Tuesday night was Band Night
and the Hog Roast, the remainder
of which Andy (our Pres) was still
munching through at the end of
the week. The Band (Karl, Lucy
Locket, Pauline and Yaz) were
fabulous (as always) and it was a
very well deserved, relaxing
evening.
Wednesday evening saw the
infamous Canterbury Pub Crawl
and, although I didn't go, I'm told
it was a pretty boring one, so
there's not a lot to write about.
Except, Miranda Warren pulling a
local pikie and telling everyone he
was "very intellectual". The words
"beer" and "goggles" come to
mind. Oh well.
Thursday. Oh, Thursday. I
would say it was the Druids disco,
but the Druids don't exist, as I'm
constantly reminded, it was the
Meterological Society Disco.
Basically, an excuse for a group of
nutters (I can say that as "noone
knows who they are") to dress up
in balaclavas, dirty labcoats and
get absolutely wasted. A very
messy evening and very cold
(speaks she who was shivering
behind the bar wearing 7 layers of
clothing) but a damn good laugh
and enjoyed by all. Well, most. I
do have to mention one stupid
sod that was given a glass of chilli
vodka, drank it trying to be hard
and then ended up throwing up
and crying in a corner. Don't know
who that could be, eh Ned?
Friday saw the first kidnapping
of a lecturer, sorry, two lecturers.
They both seemed to enjoy it and
I ought to thank the kidnappers.
You know who you are.
Friday was also the Charity
Ball, this year with a 1920's
theme. As your illustrious author
was working again due to a des-
perate need for money, she didn't
see many of the goings on.
However, being a bit of a nosey
cow, I find most things out any-
way, although many of them I am
unable to scrawl here out of pure
sympathy and fear. We played
host to a group of strange Agrics
from Reading who didn't under-
stand the "no more snakebite"
routine. Once again, everyone
was out in their finest, and full
respect to the Garters and the
Beaus, who were still in their
week old costumes at the ball.
Saturday saw us being beaten
by the Reading lot in a Rugby
match and I was hoping to have a
review of the match from one of
the lads, but, as you can tell, my
hoping is to no avail, so they're
going to have to put up with what
I write. At the end of the match,
we (the intrepid supporters) reck-
on only two of our team weren't
injured. Not a good tally. You
could almost sing "Heads, shoul-
ders, knees and toes" to the team
and get a response for each bit.
Considering the fact they all
limped off, I thought they battled
damn well, although the captain
(Adam) will no doubt disagree
with me as he was out injured
and jumping up and down like a
lunatic on the touchline. Yes, they
lost, but they turned out and gave
it a shot. Well done fellas.
At the end of the week, we'd
had a good laugh, drunk loads
and, most importantly raised
shed loads of money for two good
causes. Thanks to all those who
helped out and I haven't men-
tioned, like Heena Patel, John the
Porter, Emily Williams, and every-
one else I've missed off. Thanks
guys. Beci
