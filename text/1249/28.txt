Ok, here I am. While I'm here I'd like to point out that the dog food
only has one 'a' in the name, meaning that I must be the hunky
tanned warrior Mummy Huffwell talked about last week. You'll just
have to take my word on that one though since the medium of
crossword is not very good for conveying how generally wonderful
I am!
Whilst on the subject of names I thought I'd leave my name nice
and short so you can fit lots of insulting words too naughty to print
in a sentence without having to stop for breath mid-rant over a stu-
pid clue. Aren't I kind?
Now on to the real business. The winner of last week's cross-
word is Paul Kirk, Maths III. Give your answers for this weeks puz-
zle in at the Felix office or email to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk and you
too could have your name printed in big bold letters on this page
too, just like lucky Paul. Real business is now over and I still have
far too many lines of mindless babbling to fill. Errrr... Oh yeah, by
the time this is printed you will have no doubt heard about that
fantastic piece of theatre taking place this week in the UCH. It's
called 'And Then There Were None' By Aggie Christie and is really
very good - but hurry it ends on Saturday.
Ah, now I have a problem. I've exhausted all my creative ability
crafting this crossword and have been left spent and unable to fill
the rest of this box with words so I'll leave you now to give the
crossword a go or even, god forbid, actually listen to your lecturer.
That wasn't too bad was it? Hope you enjoy the crossword.
