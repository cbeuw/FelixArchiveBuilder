Shifty Disco -They Actually Like the Records They Release
And so we come to this, a compi-
lation album, by a label that
"loves its work" and "the records it
releases", or so we are informed.
Which seems strange as I would
assume all labels like their records
because they make money from
them in almost all cases.
Shifty Disco seem to think they
are unique in this attitude and so
pack their compilation with such
revolutionary, forward thinking
and fabulously well known artists
like Jackdrag(?) and Schwabd?).
Despite being a quite obviously
independent label from the mecca
of astonishingly cool nu-music
that is, Oxford, they manage to
put together a pretty solid album
that you could easily pass off as
Mutations-era Beck only with
more shoegazing, Quaaludes and
a touch of elctroclash. Sounds
bizarre? Its amazing how right
most of it sounds.
We kick off with AM60, presum-
ably named after a road some-
where in the midlands, who start
off with a promising drum roll but
then become the Beach Boys
singing songs by N'Sync. They fol-
low this with a "tune" that would-
n't be out of place on an episode
of Andy Pandy (Younger readers
may not understand this refer-
ence. Ask your grandparents). A
pleasant enough start, but we
want something a bit meatier.
So we get Jackdrag, who appar-
ently enjoy getting high with Jesus
and sound much the same as you
imagine the twelve disciples
would have done just after the
crucifixion and some good strong
herbs. Note good use of the elec-
tronic wobble board here.
Following them we get Elf
Power, who in between fighting
for the rights of the magic
munchkins among us and having
afternoon tea with hobbits, man-
age to sound exactly the same as
the last two bands. Amazing !!
Next up Beulah, who appear to
have been named after a vomit
and claim they had their hearts
stolen by punk rock.
Unfortunately, unsubstantiated
claims like that won't hold up in a
court of law and neither would the
music, especially if the case was
"The artists featured on Shifty
Discos' compilation versus Beck
and Brian "Hey everybody I've
gone insane" Wilson". Onwards
then...
To The Young Knives, who win
the award for "Artist most unlike
Beck on this album". Bizarrely,
they sound a bit like the Sex
Pistols, only much friendlier, and
better at playing instruments.
Extra points for getting in the
lyrics to Nick Nack Paddywhack
as well (people from the South,
don't even try and understand this
reference). All in good fun. Dom
Cave In
Tides of Tomorrow
Picture the scene, you're a young
band in Methuen, Massachusetts,
you've been playing with your
mates for a few years now, doing
it the hard way, gigging constant-
ly, taking your music to the mass-
es and trying to build up some
kind of loyal fanbase who will buy
your self released EP's.
Eventually, you sign to an inde-
pendent label and put out an
album that is welcomed with
open arms.
People start to listen to your
spaced out, dizzy, prog-hardcore,
emo and talking about it in a flat-
tering light, things are going good.
Then, all of a sudden, Dave Grohl
announces that you are his new
favourite band and invites you to
support the Foo Fighters on a tour
of Britain's arenas. Wham!! There
you are, straight into the public
2/5
consciousness, people outside
your home town start talking
about you, people in the media
want to do interviews and start
hyping you as the saviours of
music. In short, you become
famous overnight.
So what then? Where to go?
Do you make an album for the
fans or the record label? Luckily,
the decision faced Cave In after
they had finished recording this -
their third album. Otherwise
things could so easily have been
different. You feel like they're
doing it because they want to get
their message (whatever it is) to
the kids, they just love playing
music and they don't want the
hype or attention. "We just got
lucky. Don't shoot us!". It's a very
mature sounding album for ones
so young though, kind of like
Rival Schools doing King Crimson
but through a Yes filter.
While they may have been hit
by the press' "prog" stick, it's pos-
sibly slightly unfair to burden
them with that career-killing term
at this stage. Sure, they don't
sound like your average run-of-
the-mill emo band, but then who
wants to listen to something aver-
age. Of course, it can be a dan-
gerous game this being different
thing and its one they don't win
convincingly. There isn't enough
passion in what they do or say
and sometimes they just fall flat
on their faces, getting bogged
down with being clever instead of
playing with the passion and hon-
esty that they are capable of. Mr
Grohl, time for a new favourite
band.

Singles
Nu - Disco Hurts
Clever name, snappy title and a
blistering song. Everything is in
place for this 4-piece champi-
oned by Lauren Laverne and
Claire Sturgess. Riding along on
a resurgence of (that's right)
new-wave, an electronicback-
beat gives way to a chugging
Blondie-esque tale of nightlife
lowlife before we hit a wall of
sound and chorus which many
thought had been copyrighted
by Bellatrix. Factory Girl is a 2
minute trash in the style of The
Hives - ragged guitar breaks
and howling harmonies. No
doubt this lot will fit in well with
the current scene. The thing is,
with the likes of the excellent
Yeah Yeah Yeahs around, is
there any need for them? We
can only wait to see how they'll
follow this up.
4/5 Deepesh
Corrigan - We're The Wire
Predictable riff-driven action
from new Irish lads Corrigan.
Pounding bass and crunching
chords drop to an insistent and
barely restrained verse of dark
lyrics sung through clenched
teeth, before leaping headlong
into desperate bouts of frantic
shouting, mangled guitars and
venting of spleen, repeated until
tedious. Quoting obvious influ-
ences like Jesus Lizard and the
less expected Johnny Cash,
whose dark lyrical humour is
reflected in Corrigan's own,
they have the frustrated energy
of teenage youth confined to
small town life, and have found
an outlet for it in the cathartic
rebellion of garage punk. Not a
bad idea, but probably more for
their benefit than for ours.
