IC Radio Gold
Mission Impossible, IC Radio's
premier talk show, has won the
gold award in the "Best Speech
Based Factual Programme" cate-
gory at the national Student Radio
Awards 2002.
The show, put together by
Imperial's Science Communication
students, was nominated at a
regional party at LSE Students'
Union last month, as reported in
Felix 1245.
The main ceremony took place
last week at Goldsmiths College,
in the presence of such radio lumi-
naries as Steve Lamacq, Kevin
Greening, Tim Westwood, Andy
Parfitt and Jon Holmes. For the
third successive year, Emma B
hosted the event in front of a
packed audience of students and
industry insiders, and provided
her now customary selection of
terrible jokes. Gold, silver and
bronze awards were handed out in
each of the ten categories, ranging
from "Best Newcomer" to "Best
Marketing and Promotions".
Cardiff's Xpress Radio were par-
ticularly successful, with Vicki
Blight winning "Best Female
news.felix@ic.ac.uk
Presenter", and Priority scooping
the prize for "Best Show". The
highly sought-after "Student Radio
Station of the Year" award was
won by Surrey University's GU2,
whose prize includes a two-hour
broadcast on Radio 1.
The gold award for "Best
Speech Based Factual
Programme" was presented by
BBC Radio Five Live's Julian
Worricker, and collected by
Mission Impossible presenters
Derek Thorne, Frances Beckerleg,
Georgina Mason and Gareth
Mitchell. The silver and bronze
awards were won by Newslink
Special (LSR, Leeds University)
and Stars of the Musical
Underground (Birst, Bournemouth
University) respectively.
The students behind Mission
Impossible will be rewarded with
work experience at BBC Radio
Five Live.
After the gold award (actually
made of glass) had been safely
escorted back to the studios by
the station manager, the IC Radio
delegation thoroughly enjoyed
mixing with other student sta-
tions, and celebrities, at the after-
show party. It was reported that a
presenter of ICR's infamous Ben &
Jerry show shared a dancefloor
kiss with Steve Lamacq, presenter
of Radio l's Evening Session.
Sadly, no photographic evidence
could be obtained.
Past recordings of Mission
Impossible can be found at
www.icradio.com. The show
returns to the airwaves in January.
