Bjork
Greatest Hits
Bjork's not the first artist you'd
think of, when it comes to releas-
ing 'Greatest Hits' albums, and
this surprising move from the
adorable Icelandic pixie has
raised the age-old question -
cash-in or definitive collection?
With less than a hint of bias,
I'm gonna go for definitive collec-
tion. It's been nine glorious years
since she left the Sugarcubes and
punk behind her, and since then
she has continued to make beau-
tiful and challenging music, a
tricky mix by anyone's standards.
The record opens with the
uplifting All Is Full Of Love.
Fleeting strings merge with subtle
keyboards, the ambience perfo-
rated by a heavily filtered drum-
beat. Then Bjork starts singing.
And you float. The music is
4/5
densely layered and yet it feels so
light and airy. Her vocal style,
unparalleled, unmistakable, inim-
itable, is particularly strong on
the anthemic Play Dead. Opening
with a scream/sing/thing of unbe-
lievable emotional intensity, she
goes on to whisper, sing and
growl her way through the track -
aspiring female vocalists take
note. Her stirring and evocative
lyrics couple seamlessly with the
theatrical orchestral arrangement.
Add this to the impressive percus-
sion and bass lines and you have
a song that is very hard not to feel
a part of.
Bjork is indeed the complete
artist and she shows her ugly side
on the merciless Army Of Me. A
distinctly vitriolic tune composed
of dark bass lines, lo-fi metallic
beats and distorted guitars.
"If you complain once more,
you'll meet an army of me". One
angry pixie.
Every song on this album
stands out like a neon sore
thumb. Despite the fact that the
tracks all have very different
strengths they do have unifying
factors. Firstly and obviously, her
voice; secondly and somewhat
ironically, their eclecticity (made
that up). Bachelorette is tango
with electronica beats - awesome,
but honestly, where did that come
from? Hidden Place is another
example; Inuit choir + strings +
beats + Bjork = Stunning. You
know a record is good when an
artist claims that All Is Full Of
Love, and you start to believe
them. Dr Monkeez
TLC
3D
3/5
Let's get right to the crux of the
issue - TLC's new album 3D -
released a few months after the
death of member Lisa 'Left Eye'
Lopes - is thankfully low on sen-
timent and high on beats. With
men of the moment The
Neptunes on board, they look
forward to reclaiming the title of
World's Best Girl Group from
Destiny's Child.
Their mission gets off to a good
start - Quickie takes the sass of
Crazysexycool and welds it to the
musical innovation of Fanmail, in
the form of twisting, spiralling
R'n'b mini-epic. Forthcoming sin-
gle Girl Talk does a good job of
matching its billing as "the new
millennium female anthem" with
its funky chorus and clever
hooks; it picks up where No
Scrubs left off, and is the kind of
thing Ashanti, Maya et al. would
do if they were any good.
The obligatory tribute to Lopes,
Turntable, comes from the pen of
schmaltz king Rodney Jerkins -
so no need to describe what that
sounds like. However, it is cer-
tainly a heartfelt song and
deserves respect.
In Your Arms Tonight is the
track produced by the current
rulers of the pop landscape The
Neptunes, and is completely dif-
ferent to Turntable. It's cutting
edge and sexy, thanks to the
trademark synths that did so
much for Britney, Justin and
everyone else riding the coat tails
of Pharrel Williams and co.
Damaged is what Turntable
could've been - essentially
"Unpretty - version 2". It's just a
very sweet pop song.
3D is far from perfect. Dirty
Dirty is a below par shot at the
Missy Elliot sound, and Hands
Up is plodding and dreary, as is
the tail end of the album, which
unfortunately lacks fresh ideas.
Artists such as Alicia Keys and
the aforementioned Elliot are
reinventing the urban female
sound originally pioneered by
TLC. Where they were once the
leaders of a movement, they are
now merely worthy disciples -
this is the ultimate conclusion
drawn from 3D. That said, Lopes
would be proud of the girls - for
this is a strong and admirable
statement in the face of fierce
adversity. Robin Som

A - Something's Going On
Listening to A is a bit like
watching (old) repeats of The
Simpsons. You pretty much
know what to expect; but that
doesn't stop it being great.
Although the band have
stressed that their current
album is a more serious affair,
that still hasn't stopped them
being labelled as the fun-lov-
ing scamps of rock. They're
certainly not helping their
cause by releasing bouncy
pop-punk like this.
A chugging base line is fol-
lowed by Jason Perry's trade-
mark squawk, and the rest is
as you'd expect from A; name-
ly, an instantly memorable
tune that you'll need an indus-
trial sized crowbar to remove.
They say familiarity breeds
contempt: If this is contempt,
I'd like some more!

SI Futures - Eurostar
The 3rd single from the Mark
Radcliffe favourites sees them
ditch their ultra-minimalist
approach for something that
you could actually foresee
people taking notice of.
A floaty, vocoder tinged
vocal is laid over the top of a
beat that is close to drum 'n'
bass proportions. It's sort of
what you'd expect if Air and
Frou Frou mixed up their mas-
ter tapes.
The track bounds along
with intent but is missing that
spark which made debut sin-
gle We Are Not A Rock Bond
such a pleasure. Their singles
show that the duo are full of
ideas. Hopefully, with the suc-
cess of contemporaries My
Computer, they'll be able to
put them on a great album.
