It was 2.58pm and I was on my
way to a Physics tutorial which
started at 3pm. I pushed the but-
ton for a lift and then waited for
27 minutes until, finally, a lift
came that was both heading in
the right direction and wasn't so
full that I would likely suffocate.
Twenty minutes later and we'd
made it as far as level 9, where
everybody else got out, leaving
me alone. The doors shut. Then
there was a thud. Then a wallop,
a bang and a clang, followed by a
shudder. Then a kind of wibbly-
wobbly boinging motion that
doesn't really have a good word to
describe it. The doors opened,
and I found myself on level 9Vz.
Finding all of this rather too odd
for a Tuesday afternoon, and see-
ing as I'd missed my tutorial now
anyway, I decided to go down
again, but this time I thought it
would be a good plan to take the
stairs. Heading towards the
Physics common room, I couldn't
help but think that things looked
a little different to usual.
I'm not sure whether it was the
old woman serving gruel from a
large cauldron, or the stagecoach-
es passing outside, or the stu-
dents sitting around writing with
quills onto parchment, but things
machine, sounding very much
like an old man with a cold.
"Cappuccino please."
A sneezing sound came from
the coffee machine. "That'll be
four guineas, six farthings, two
crowns, three pounds, eight
groats, five shillings, sixpence
ha'penny please."
Machines!
seemed to be a little more old-
fashioned than normal, even for
the Physics department.
I sat in the common room on an
oak chair, near to some students
wearing top hats. Somebody was
fighting with what looked like a
clockwork coffee machine.
"Please, sir, I want some
more," said the student.
"More what?" said the coffee
The student handed a coin to
the machine, which then gave
him back his change in a wheel-
barrow. Several whirrings could
be heard and then an elderly
hand reached out to give the stu-
dent his coffee. He sat down near
me.
"Why, this coffee, I liken it to a
foul broth of intestinal fluids," he
said.
TH€ RETURN OF TH€ 40% DISCOUNT II
"Pray yes, of that it doth remind
me also," said another student,
with a large boil on his nose.
"Verily, for much displeasure
hath this coffee brought upon my
insides", I replied, which was odd
because I don't normally talk like
that.
The student with the boil
looked at his pocket watch. "I
shall now depart for the type-
writer suite, for I must send a let-
ter to my lecturer via carrier
pigeon. I have vainly tried to pit
myself against a difficult problem
sheet," and he left.
"Away we to the union this fine
eve, for a night of idle pleasures?"
said a girl to the student who had
acquired the coffee. He appeared
to be itching to get into her corset
- or was that just because of the
fleas?
I left, to try to find a way back
to the twenty-first century.
