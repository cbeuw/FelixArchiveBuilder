3 0 S P O R T F E L I X
Level at LSE
IC I 1 - 1 LSE
We were really fired up for the
game - LSE had beaten us 10
days previously - and couldn't
wait to get into it get ours back.
They decided to turn up half
an hour late, which pissed us off
even more, so as soon as the
game started we showed our
intentions. Going totally into
every challenge, we established
our superiority, from the start.
We looked solid at the back,
good going forward, were creat-
ing chances and looking more
likely to score. Joss's volley went
just wide, and his header deflect-
ed off a defender. Then they
started coming forward and got a
penalty when their striker stum-
bled on to Hendrik. Carlos
though knew where their man
was going for, making a great
save in the bottom right corner.
After about 5 minutes a great
piece of play by us, involving
about 6 players, switched play to
the left, for a spot-on cross by
Ant to Joss who headed it coolly
past the keeper. Almost straight
after a cross came in from the
left, but Dave put it wide, then
Hendrik's header forced their
keeper to a magnificent save.
We decided to keep the lead at
half time, we stepped out again,
not looking as sharp though for
the first 15 minutes which
allowed them to settle for a bit
then after a blatant push on
Alan,which the referee never saw
their striker managed to score.
That woke us up, and we
started battling, and missed even
more chances. Oli's shot going
just wide, when everyone
thought it was in, Mark's free
kick that their keeper just saved,
pushing the ball on the bar, and,
following some great football by
us, Mark one on one with the
keeper, putting the ball just wide.
Don't think he can miss that
again, even if he tries.
Well, sometimes, some things
are just not meant to be.
RH Cut Down
IC 135 - 87 RHUL
A relatively small but perfectly
formed fencing team made their
way to deepest darkest Egham -
in the dark heart of Surrey - to
thwart the threat of the 'almost
london' wannabes.
Due to careers fair and some
extremely strange fixture plan-
ning this was the first match
that we had played for four
weeks, since our trouncing of
the novice Sussex team 135-53,
which is a massive margin in
anyone's estimation.
After arriving - and just about
on time too - we were greeted by
what seemed to be a seriously
under-strength Holloway team.
And so it indeed proved to be, as
we managed to win the first
weapon, sabre, without a single
sabreur. Big Daddy Rob, Yugo
Hugo and Handbag Hughes all
turned their hands to an unfa-
miliar weapon and their winning
was clearly a good omen.
Even better than these first
steps to victory was the crippling
head shot dished out by Yugo
halfway through the second
weapon that reduced their
already seriously under strength
team to a mere pair of freshers.
This left a victory in the foil
inevitable, with Yugo, Handbag
and Genius Phil ensuring a wide
victory margin.
After an deeply uncharacteris-
tic surge of compassion on our
part, we decided to let them
substitute on the only other
fencer present before the epee
encounter took place.
Unperturbed by the uncharac-
teristic pair of X chromosomes
that were on offer, we stuck to
the task at hand, as we were
eager to get to the pub as quick-
ly as possible.
Solid performances all round
again from Big Daddy, Yugo and
Handbag sealed the victory and
it was off down the bar to eat,
drink and prove our ignorance of
general trivia.
Kent Defeated LSE Thrashed
IC I 2 - 0 Chichester
After practising our cricket skills
outside the union we headed
off, once again, to defend our
seemingly impregnable fortress
at Harlington.
The IC Cavaliers started like
an absolute bunch of muppets,
but fortunately for us Kent were
even worse. The early
exchanges seemed to go to us,
with Stinky, Toadfish and
Boyzone looking imperious in
the midfield.
The - much better looking - IC
team continued to improve and
a period of immense pressure
resulted in two penalty flicks
being awarded in our favour.
The first stormed past the keep-
er, skillfully glancing off the
inside of the post. The second,
however was an absolute and
total ballmonkey of an attempt
going wider than anyone ever
thought possible.
sport.felix@ic.ac.uk
With the score at 1-0
Geography Teacher put Gump
through, who slipped it to Star
Wars on the flick spot. The Kent
keeper went down quicker than
Star Wars' bird, allowing him to
make it 2-0.
With Boyzone and Trailer no.
2 screaming like girls we some-
how managed to let two goals in
to let them claw it back to 2-2.
After Star Wars put IC back on
top in the last few minutes nut-
megging the keeper from three
yards, Villager decided to pass a
kyrder straight to their centre
forward - twat - on the top of the
D with a double hit/slap. He
also managed to collapse on the
astro, though we have no idea
how. Luckily the Ump blew for
time just as he was striking the
ball but he still missed - lucky
Villager.
So, despite the Fortress being
Violated twice we came away
with a legendary win - the leg-
end continues.
IC I 11 - 0 LSE I
Well, today the IC goal machine
was well and truly up and run-
ning, hammering LSE 11-0. We
were unstoppable from start to
finish, and LSE really had no
clue how to stop a legendary
performance.
Boyzone bundled past the
odd defender before unleashing
a legendary reverse-stick effort
to nudge the well oiled machine
into a deserved lead. Zoolander
then came up with two of his
trademark looping drag-flicks to
put IC into a commanding 3-0
lead. Some more seriously slick
build up play led to star wars
getting a shooting opportunity.
He duly let fly and such was the
power of the shot that
Zoolander could have flown to
Poland before the ball 'hit' the
back of the goal. Boyzone then
mashed another from the edge
of the D to make it 5-0.
After the half time break and
Villager's bunch of bananas the
pace was kept up and some
astonishing moves were put into
play. Boyzone led the band by
example, and knocked another
reverse stick shot into the goal
to complete his hat-trick.
The next deposit into the IC
gold card account came from
Star Wars who simply walked
round the keeper. Gump decid-
ed to fight back, putting one
shot straight under the keeper
and 'square cutting' his second
to assure us all that he should-
n't get a jug for not scoring.
Then LSE somehow managed to
miss Stinky's stench, as he
unleashed Hell from the top of
the D and neatly into the top
corner.
Finally old GT managed to fin-
ish from his third attempt and
score from three yards and the
match was complete. Wonder if
they'll bother to turn up next
time... the legend continues.
My brain is the consistency of semolina...
