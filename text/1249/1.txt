The plans for merging UCL and Imperial have
been cancelled only four weeks after they were
first proposed. The rector sent a letter to all
students and staff on Monday outlining his rea-
sons for the collapse of talks at this preliminary
stage.
While Sir Richard claimed that "it has
already become clear that the best interests of
our two institutions are not served by a formal
merger", he went on to say that this had been
a useful exercise, hinting that informal collabo-
ration with UCI may still be a very real
prospect.
This break may have come as a surprise to
some, since many of the papers presented by
academics at Imperial have seemed quite posi-
tive. However, Felix has learned that many sen-
ior academics claim that the papers were moti-
vated far more on a political level, than by true
representation of the average staff member. On
top of this, upon reading several of the papers
that Felix acquired, it was clear that they were
Artist's Impression of Merger Breakdown
being written within the framework of an
Imperial takeover rather than a true merger.
It would seem, however, that the real reasons
for the breakdown are mainly within the execu-
tive of UCL. One senior academic source
described the situation as "More of a rape than
a marriage", and it is clear that this feeling was
echoed all the way down through the college
hierarchies.
One reason for the different feelings between
the two academic bodies may be due to the rel-
ative stability that Imperial enjoys compared to
the scientific departments within UCL: if the
merger was attempted and failed, Imperial
would suffer considerably less.
In the past UCL academics have been instru-
mental in the ousting of a provost, and it is
clear that whatever the true situation at this
end, they were not happy with the idea of a
merger, and thus presented a serious risk of not
taking this lying down. Rumblings within
College have suggested that Sir Richard decid-
ed that going against such strong opinion may
not be worth the effort, when a more subtle
approach may yield better results.
If this is true, we can expect to see much
greater collaboration between the two universi-
ties' departments, and this may well be just the
beginning of something that will happen over a
much longer time scale.

Felix Website Launch
After eight weeks of intensive pro-
gramming, the Felix website is
going to be launched on Monday.
The new site will be a compre-
hensive web version of the paper
issue, and will have many added
features as well.
While the site has been up for
some weeks now, it has been
mainly a reproduction of the paper
issue, and was being used prima-
rily as a testing ground for new
ideas.
The new site has been built by
Alisdair Wren, a final year com-
puting student. It has been con-
structed with ease of use for both
readers and editors in mind, and
many of the features are back
end, allowing editors to enter their
content in both the weekly issues
and in web-only sections. With a
search engine, it will soon become
the first place to find information
about the Union, College and stu-
dent events.
The online nature will also allow
Felix to publish news instantly,
allowing Felix to keep up to date
on a daily basis. In the past news
has always been at least a day
old, due to printing constraints.
One of the main features of the
new site is a system for comment-
ing on news stories. Previously
there has been no way to reply to
the news, or indeed to any other
article, and the hope is that this
will allow students to get more
involved in what they read, and
therefore also hopefully the deci-
sions that are made within the
Union.
Future updates to the site will
involve including the puzzles
pages and crossword, and online
article submission.
