Victory on the Cam
Imperial College rowers descended
on the river Cam last Saturday for
this year's Cambridge Winter Head
with encouraging success in what
was, for many, their first rowing race.
The 2.5km distance was a time trial
with crews set off at intervals to try
to be the fastest in their division.
In spite of getting up long before
the sun, the women's novice eight
was on top form as their 'machine'
took on various Cambridge and
London colleges in a dominant fash-
ion. With enough time to admire the
scenery (and repaint the hull too),
they spectacularly creamed the
entire field, finishing a whole minute
and ten seconds ahead of Pembroke
College, the second-place finisher.
The men's experienced novice
eight took sixth place in a race with
the frontrunners split by seconds, fin-
ishing just nine behind the second-
place runner. Meanwhile, the two
beginner novice eights took promis-
ing second and fourth places, the W
team finishing just five seconds
behind the winners and the 'B' team
over fifty seconds clear of the rest of
the field.
In the student Senior-4 Four
event, the men took second place
losing out to Magdalene College,
Cambridge by a small margin but
finished well clear of the rest of the
field. The women's student four had
enough time for elevenses, easily
seeing off Peterhouse College to win
their event.
The men's ARA 'senior 4' eight
were flying that day, finishing well
ahead of Winchester College to take
the top spot in their division and dis-
turbing Cambridge with a sonic
boom as they put in the second
fastest time seen on the river all day.
As it is the first race of the season,
all of the rowers would like to thank
our coxes, who steered us all the
way as well as motivating us without
turning the air too blue - we hope all
of those early morning outings were
worth it. Thanks also to Stu, who
looks after the boats so patiently,
even when we attack the trailer with
their rudders.
The novices would like to thank
Ian, Roger and Tom, who have tire-
lessly coached us for six weeks (even
if they may have 'real' jobs or PhDs)
and who energetically cheered us on
near the finish, fuelled by KitKats,
sandwiches and half a burger stand.
Last, but very definitely not least, we
would like to thank Bill, who made
us get up at ungodly hours, get wet,
do things that could only be
described as masochistic and who
Hockey
IC Ladies 1 2 - 0 Chichester
Without a warm up we dressed in
pink pillowcases and set out to
knock the league leaders off their
perch. Our new captain Claire 'the
Don' gave us an inspirational team
talk as she lead us out. We domi-
nated straight away, although Buffy
was forced to slay a Wishy monster.
The back was solid with Bubbles
and Yoda using their lightsabre
hockey sticks to perfection. Towards
the end of the first half Lady P
crossed a beautiful ball into Jo 'Bing'
Chandler who 'megged the keeper to
get the first goal.
In the second half Wishy came
back at us and gave embryo a hard
time, forcing a telling off from Wishy
and getting Jo's magic moment. We
fought hard with a strong attack
from Spell Check and Kiwi Boot, but
the second half goal came from a
forced pass from Anti Climax to
Rachel 'Swear Word' Lennon and
she sent it home with class.
got us hooked.
For the novices, the weekend's
event, their first, bodes extremely
well for the Allom Cup on Saturday
23rd November. The Allom cup is
primarily for Beginner novices and is
on home turf/water too; it can be
viewed on Eurosport and Sky Sports
2 with extended highlights later on
ITV or you can wander down to
the University of London boat club at
10am and see IC novice rowers take
on the rest of UL (and win). You can
then read about it here next week.

The man of the match had to go
to Flush who worked hard at the
back. A great afternoon finished
with a long coach journey home-
with no food, because Wishy ate it
all - luckily John was on hand to
provide entertainment and keep us
happy.
IC II 20 - 0 St Bart's
If ever there needed to be proof of
medical students' lack of sporting
prowess then this was it.
Oddjob - our keeper - got so
bored that he spent most of the
match trying to chat up some ming-
dog footballers who were glad to be
separated from him by a big fence.
Even Butthick had enough shots
to register with his awesome 1%
conversion record. Harvester got a
quality hat trick, including the goal
of the game followed by a Kevball
celebration, obviously trying to get
on the early bus home.
Muff, we missed you about as
much as syphilis!
