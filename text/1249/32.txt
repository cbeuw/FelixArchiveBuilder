IC Virgins 1 5 - 5 Sussex
We are lush, very very lush. Our
first win of the season was,
unfortunately a friendly, but has
given us a lush base on which to
build many many more lush
wins. And all because of the
MONKEY.
Sussex, an unknown quantity
to the Virgin's, turned up early,
in numbers and with a couple of
big fat props, but nothing too
scary.
Kick off led to the first 15
minutes or so, and we were
camped firmly in their 22, giving
us time to build up essential
confidence. Eventually, after
many scrums both ways due to
lots of poor handling skills giving
way to knock-ons galore, the
ball made it out to our right
winger, Trev. She ran down the
side-line and, when she was just
about to put it over the line was
tackled, resulting in spillage and
lost ball trauma. But all was not
lost, when Ling with some lush
insight kicked the ball in the
direction in which Priya was
running. Priya scooped up the
hobbling ball and put it over the
line for her first try of the sea-
son. Yeah baby, lush.
In between our moments of
glory, they slipped one past us to
score. Off the back of a scrum,
their fly half received the ball
and after a couple of mis-tackles
and some good palming off, she
made it to the line. Luckily due
to some lush intimidation, their
kicker could not convert the try.
Our next try involved lots of
speed and agility. Helen - our
lush fly half - took the ball into a
maul, this resulted in Ling get-
ting the ball out to Charlotte in
the line. She quickly passed it to
Jess at outside centre, who got it

RSM 4 - 2 Holloway
No one needed reminding that the
we are steely competitors with
brass balls, and expecting victory
to feather the nest they had creat-
ed at the top of the league, Tailing
had watched his vaunted defence
get torn apart in the first half.
Then came the resurgence. The
mighty wind of justice swung in
favour of RSM wiping the smiles
off the Holloway faces. On the
52nd minute Kan bent one in from
long range. Cashback.
Soon after El Gringo penetrated
forcefully and popped up
unchecked to finish calmly at the
back post. RSM continued to
press with dangerous Dino remov-
ing the aerial threat throughout
the midfield. On 67 mins he
struck with a finish reminiscent of
David Piatt's goal against Belgium
in Italia 90.
Despite the referee's ineptitude,
with the last kick of the game Paul
exploited the moist box by plant-
ing his 'seed' deep within the rap-
tures of the gaping net.
Dirty B bought a bit of French
composure to the back line, with
Ben and James providing support.
Toby was sacrificed for Dingo
whose enormous towering frame
instilled fear into the averagely
heighted opposition back four.
IC I 17 - 3 GKT
From next week there will be
notices up throughout the Union
Building, in Beit Quad, for all
teams to write their scores on.
These will come down when the
bars close on Wednesday
nights, for publication in the fol-
lowing Friday's Felix, so make
sure you add them before then if
you want to see your team's
scores in print.
Just remember to add your
team's details, those of the
opposition, and the result.
out to Priya who ran at least half
of the pitch avoiding numerous
defenders to score under the
posts. The conversion didn't
quite make it, but let's face it,
we can't all be perfect.
The second half led to them
managing to hold us up more
but they still didn't manage to
put any real pressure on us. This
brings us to out last try. After a
good afternoon of back's work,
credit must go to the good quick
hands down the line. The ball
was passed from the back of the
scrum ending up in Priya's
hands, yes she was there again,
but she was deprived of a hat-
trick by a tackle, the ball went to
ground but was picked up by the
agile Ash who put the ball right
in the corner. Lush.
As usual, the outstanding
players of the match have a
mention, back and forward of
the match goes to Dan and Priya
for putting themselves about and
seeing lots of action(l). Those
not rewarded, by downing a
pint, include Monkey and Ella,
whose tackling was superb,
absolutely first class. Also,
Aoife, the poor bugger played
out of position at fly half, and
had a pretty blinding match
regardless.
People thirsty for gossip, will
probably be pleased to know
that the tradition of inter-rugby
team incest is not dead. A cer-
tain curly haired Virgin got it on
with a certain Brummy first
team captain. Also, Ash the
Animal has been getting jiggy
with a member of the second
team. Oh and just in case you
missed it, the incest gets a little
closer to home with the infa-
mous Dappy and Pete (that's a
bar name) having lots of drunk-
en snogs and they're not the
first, I'd like to point out.
