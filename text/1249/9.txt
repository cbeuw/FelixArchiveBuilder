Ray Peacock is vicious, antagonis-
tic, "I go on, banter and try to
start fights, I love it". Not just
amongst the few to have provoked
glassware to fly stagewards, but
possibly the only performer to
have caught the offending
objects. His act is solely about the
generation of anger, within him-
self and his audience by "that
thing of saying unsayable things".
To an American in the audience:
"They (the twin towers) used to
be the tallest buildings in the
world, well now they're the
widest". The only other notable
aspect to Ray Peacock is his arro-
gance, "I do talks, public speak-
ing,... I educate people. It's my
duty as an intellectually superi-
or being". He is as one-
dimensional as he sounds,
with reason.
Ray Peacock was created
by Comedian Jon Williams
as an alter-ego for his friend
Ian Boldsworth. It's clear that
Williams used little imagination,
Boldsworth often displaying the
staggering lack of self-awareness
that Ray Peacock thrives on. "You
can't teach it" this former
drama student says of act-
ing, missing the irony.
For such an unreserved,
almost aggressive per-
son, whose comedy is so
confrontational, his influ-
I ences are surprisingly
I placid. His hero is Les
I Dawson. Boldsworth has
penned both his official biogra-
phies, book and film. More
recently his inspiration has been
Johnny Vegas, whose passion he
particularly admires "Johnny just
hits it. He puts his heart and soul
into it, which is really important".
It was perhaps this emphasis on
commitment that led Boldsworth
to enter Ray Peacock as a candi-
date to be Lord Mayor of London.
His campaign slogan: "Bringing
my warm Northern Sensibilities
into your cold fucked up shit
Southern lives!!" was predictably
robust. Typically though he didn't
capitalise on a promising start
and Peacock failed even to gain
any meaningful publicity, let alone
votes.
Boldsworth has other high
ambitions for his character, hop-
ing that Ray Peacock will soon
emulate the "brilliantly per-
formed" exploits of American
Scott Capurro. With what might
charitably be called misplaced
confidence, he has put little effort
into developing any depth to Ray
Peacock - he's Northern, cross
and supercilious, that's all - and a
transformation of some propor-
tions will have to occur before he
possesses even half of Capurro's
wit and skill. Boldsworth's tech-
nique is simple "I jig people up in
a funny way,., they get giddy, and
you get them giddy, and you're
keeping control on stage, but
looking like you're giddy, and you
get a really good feeling in the
room, and then you can say any-
thing to anyone." As such, an
evening with Ray Peacock is at
it's best when he garners a strong
response. Most comedians do not
risk this total reliance on circum-
stances beyond their control, and
Peacock's hit-and-miss perform-
ances show their wisdom.
This act is not a smooth pro-
gression building laughter along
the way, it fluctuates severely,
Peacock never managing to sus-
tain the energy he creates with his
sudden outbursts, perhaps just an
inevitable penalty of their extreme
nature, but a drawback nonethe-
less. Ultimately this man's per-
formance depends on the volatili-
ty of his audience, so if you go see
him, don't hold back, he loves
nothing more than a heckle and a
knifing.
