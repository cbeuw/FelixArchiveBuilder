Sammy
Theatre Royal Stratford East
If like me, you go expecting the
story of Sammy Davis Jr to be
told in chronological order you
will be surprised. The story
telling tool used is unconven-
tional and revolves around the
audition process for a forthcom-
ing fictional musical about
Sammy Davis Jr. At times the
lack of actual story line can
cause your attention to waver as
there is no suspense or intrigue.
It is however an inventive idea.
The facts, where you learn
about his life, are from the snip-
pets of conversation exchanged
between the hopefuls who are
auditioning for the main part
and the passionate man, Hillard
Elkins (portrayed by Peter
Straker) who is putting them
through their paces. You learn
what Sammy Davis Jr meant to
black performers at the height of
his fame and what his memory
means to a new generation of
performers.
His songs, including 'Rhythm
of Life', 'Mr Bojangles' and 'That
Old Black Magic', and the tap
performed by this young group
of actors gives you an insight
and understanding of the mind
of a man who has been credited
by some with inventing the
blues.
At times the voices chosen
may not give these amazing
songs the justice they deserve.
However, Peter Straker has an
amazing blues voice which
transports you to a different time
and place.
The skills of the pianist and
flutist/saxophonist, which are on
the stage and as much a part of
the action as the actors, are also
amazing. There is a particularly
interesting scene where Lolade
Falana (portrayed by Ngo Ngofa)
and the pianist have a tap-
piano playing battle - it has to
be seen.
This all paints a picture that
allows you to see how Sammy
Davis Jr battled against conven-
tion to achieve what was consid-
ered at the time unreachable:
fame as a black performer to be
enjoyed by black people.
Despite not learning many his-
torical facts you gain something
more important, hearing his
legacy of amazing songs, brings
alive the mood and culture of
the time and illustrates how one
man can change provide inspira-
tion across generations.
Showing from the 11th
November 2002.

Masters of Colour: Derain to Kandinsky
Royal Academy of Arts
Quick, quick, quick! Although you
don't have much time left to catch
this exhibition it is definitely worth
rushing for.
The exhibition includes out-
standing examples of European
and North American painting and
sculpture from Impressionism to
Abstract Expressionism, concen-
trating on the work of painters who
were chiefly concerned with colour
and its effect. Indeed the domi-
nant theme of the entire collection
is the development in the way
colour was used in twentieth cen-
tury art. The exhibition is a clear
demonstration of how vibrant
colour can be used for a direct
transcription of light, as a vehicle
for powerful emotions, or as a
means for conveying abstract
ideas.
It is interesting in itself to see
nearly a century of artwork, by
many different artists brought
together under one heading, and
with each of the four galleries
devoted to the work of a different
group of artists you can piece
together the historical context of
each work.
Gallery one features the
Impressionists, who were the first
to take full advantage of the many
bright pigments that had recently
become available. Artists like
Monet and Sisley endeavored to
capture the vibrations of light by
applying these bright colours
unmixed, this spontaneous style
changed the definition of a fin-
ished work of art.
Gallery two is dedicated to the
Fauves, the best known of whom
are Matisse, Derain, Vlaminck and
Braque. All employed colour
which was unnatural, aggressive
and even savage. This gallery also
contained the painting that has
stuck in my mind was 'Form of
Yellow (Notre Dame)' by Frantisek-
Kupka, it is a highly abstracted,
exciting work which can be read in
many different ways and is per-
haps reason enough to go and
experience the flood and wash of
colour which will surround you.
The last two galleries contain
work by Der Blaue Reiter and
German Expressionism.
Splitting the galleries into par-
ticular artistic movements pro-
vides a brief introduction to art
history for those who are unsure,
as well as providing clarity to what
could have been an over whelm-
ing experience.
Showing from the 27th July until
26th November 2002. You have
to be quick!
