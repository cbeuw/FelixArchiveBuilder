J.I.Z. is about to erupt onto the coffee-break section like a molten hot
volcano spewing lava across a once happy land. An intelligent (and I use
that term loosely) quiz playing algorithm which will compete with you in
GFQQ, LQ and the Ultraleague. Why J.I.Z.? What does it mean? It
means that Fudge and I have less work to do, we simply use the power
of J.I.Z. to come up with meaningless rubbish instead of our rather cre-
ative minds. What does J.I.Z. stand for? Jubilant quiz playing Intelligent
Zealot no less. Tenuous? Definitely. A waste of precious time?
Affirmative. Such is life in the bowels of Beit. J . I . Z .
T H E L Y R I C S
1. "We'll get some overhead lifters, and four barrel quads, oh yeah.
(Keep talkin', whoah keep talkin') Fuel injection cut off, and chrome
plated rods, oh yeah. (I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money)"
2. "The game of life is hard to play, I'm gonna lose it anyway. The
losing card I'll someday lay, so this is all I have to say."
3. "There are scratches all around the coin slot - like a heartbeat, baby
trying to wake up, but this machine can only swallow money."
4. "Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter. Little darling, it
feels like years since it's been here."
5. "Or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns, our nothing places and
our cellophane sounds....maybe it's our looseness."
6. "If fashion is your trade, then when you're naked, I guess you must
be unemployed."
7. "You've read Karl Marx and you've taught yourself to dance."
8. "I drove my tractor through your haystack last night (ooh aah ooh
aah). I threw me pitchfork at your dog to keep quiet (ooh aah ooh
aah).
9. "Pot the red and screw back for the yellow, green, brown, blue, pink
and black."
10. "You two scousers are always yapping, I'm gonna show you some
serious rapping "
