Editorial
Burble burble burble. I've just
been informed that I always end
my editorial by spouting bollocks
for the final few sentences, so this
time I thought I'd save us all the
time and get it out of the way at
the start. Then I can write what-
ever I want to my heart's content,
without fear of retribution.
I've been away, editorial-y
speaking, for the last few weeks,
and now I'm back. I feel rather like
a rapper who has just released
their second album, the title of
which is obviously Rap-Attak. The
first song would probably have
lyrics along the lines of:
"Big up to my bitches, and big
up to my boyz: with top up fees
and mergers, it's time to make
some noise. To get all yo' atten-
tion, I don't even have to cough;
I'm white, I went to Eton, and my
name is MC Toff..."
Not that this has any bearing on
anything, of course, but I feel it
important not to ignore my artistic
side. I'll say something useful in
this column, though, don't you
fret.
So yes. You may have read or
noticed or been informed that this
merger is now off. I personally
think this is a great shame,
because I was getting all sorts of
advertising and letters and stuff
(which means I have to write less
myself), and I was also very excit-
ed to see that students actually
cared about something. It's a
shame, admittedly, that we all
have to be so negative: I have
never seen such a level of reac-
tionism in all my life. "Merger?
With UCL? I'd rather eat my per-
sonal tutor" I heard. "We know
what's best for students. We are
students!" Was another classic.
This from the demographic of indi-
viduals who class a double shot of
vodka as the best cure for a hang-
over.
But anyway, it's all over now. I
quite liked the idea: the only way
it could have worked, as far as I
can tell, is that each college would
have gone on very much as
before, and we would have only
been the same uni from an admin-
istrative point of view. What does
that mean? Well, if you'd decided
that you should have been doing
English Lit as opposed to Elec Eng
(and a lot of people do), you could
change without having to change
uni, whereas now the best you
can do is go to Materials.
But as I say, that's all gone, and
so we can now all close ranks and
fight the evil oppression of top up
fees. Unusually for me I do agree
with the masses that they're a bad
idea, although I don't think that
free university education is neces-
sarily a right: I like graduate tax
more, or even free education to
those who agree to do something
useful (like become a teacher) for
a couple of years after graduation,
and those of us who go to the city
can pay graduate tax.
There's an interesting story
associated with this, actually. I
was talking to one of the heads of
the 'No To Top Up Fees' protest
that happened a few weeks back,
and he (that's all you're getting
out of me) was telling me that
what he called 'vocational
degrees' such as media studies
and fitness should be charged,
and that 'academic' studies
should be free. The justification,
apparently, being that physics and
engineering are practical, whereas
these other degrees are not.
Therefore all these people who do
physics and then go and work in
the city (nothing to do with
degree) have a right to free educa-
tion that those who do media
studies and then go and work in
the media (everything to do with
degree) do not. Call me old fash-
ioned, but it sounded like intellec-
tual fascism to me. If someone
can reasonably explain this to me,
please do write in.
My point? Well, be careful
under whose banner you protest,
basically. And also: you're proba-
bly not cynical enough.
