Millionaire
100 Club, Oxford Street
Siamese make you want to join a band there and
then. That, or simply pogo insanely around your
room. With alternating female and male lead
vocals, dressed in purposely uncool self-cut jeans,
they provide the simple passionate rhythms of King
Adora and the raunchy strength of Elastica.
The band enjoys the short set unfathomably
more than the crowd and dance manically across
the stage. They transmit Brit-pop energies with a
twist of more original concepts among their songs.
The love for what they do powers the excitement of
their set. The band is so together, so neat; it's easy
to imagine them spending every weekend in their
dad's garage until they get it right. Bless.
Span are also a band who love what they do but
unfortunately all they do is play over-used chord
sequences and bash away at a defenceless drum
kit. They have a rock bass which could make your
slightly inebriated self scream out to your metal
soul but standing sober it's not all that impressive.
Signs of hope do rise at points with promising
guitar riffs and gentle vocals, but in all honesty, this
is nothing new. Here are another group who think
that louder plus faster automatically equals better;
3/5
and like all who think that way, they're wrong.
By the time headliners Millionaire approach the
stage, Span has managed to frighten off half the
crowd. It's just wrong.
The deliciously droning melodies, simple (and
rightly so) drum beats and utterly delectable elec-
tronica combine to produce a work of rock funk art.
And a beautiful one at that. The six Belgians on
stage are full of power, spirit and the knowledge to
entertain. An amalgamation of rousing voice distor-
tions, a Cooper Temple Clause-esque drum
machine and vigorously dynamic bass create a near
perfect sequence. The classic guitar and drums
combination develop into layers of rock mayhem
and electronica madness.
The lights, the front, and the sound all work
incredibly well together to give what remains of the
tiny 100 Club crowd a real treat. Such a treat that
a guy notices me frantically making notes and
comes darting over. "Just write 'BRILLIANT' in big
letters!" he screams, before running back to swing
his stuff to the funk metal act that is Millionaire.
So there you have it. BRILLIANT.

Imagine if you will a great big
ROCK, a really, really big ROCK,
something like Gibraltar is about
the right size.
Now imagine this large ROCK
being stuffed full of high explo-
sives and blown into the next
dimension while you stand 20ft
away. Got that image? Good.
Now multiply the experience by
about... lets say 20. That should
now be pretty close to the general
feeling of a Queens of the Stone
Age show.

They are PHENOMENAL, to put
it in simple terms, phenomenal.
They play with enough power
and force that, if channelled prop-
erly, could send a small country to
the moon and back via Valhalla
and still have enough left over to
beat James Dean Bradfield in a
race for the pies. Not that there's
an ounce of extra fat in the show:
everything is stripped down to the
essentials (except - unusually -
Nick Oliveri who remains fully
clothed throughout), ie. lots of
guitars, big drums, flashing lights
and an occasionally screeched
vocal. They sound like Thor and
his mates jamming with Pete
Townshend after Led Zepellin
popped round with some Black
Sabbath records. Yes, that heavy.
But heavy in a good way.
They manage to maintain a very
raw rock sound without losing
much of the sheen from the studio
version. Current single No One
Knows keeps its tunefulness and
melody yet still feels like it could
bring a venue twice the size to its
knees and give it a good beating.
Crowd favourite Lost Art of
Keeping a Secret shows why it
will continue to be a favourite as it
stampedes its way through the
collective psyche like a raging bull
in the proverbial china shop, while
Feel Good Hit of the Summer
takes on behemoth proportions as
it is stripped down to its birthday
suit and given a good flogging in
front of a few thousand crazed
fans. Even the cello accompanied
Mosquito Song feels enormously
bigger than its two acoustic gui-
tars tonight.
Everything is held together in
astonishing fashion by Joey
Castillo, the replacement for Dave
Grohl. Attacking his kit like a man
possessed, he truly looks like he
could kick Dave's ass with his
hands tied behind his back, and is
actually the driving force behind
the juggernaut.
In fact, forget bombs, send in
the Queens and the sheer brutal
force, passion and volume should
bring Iraq to its knees. Dom

Someone remind me what
month it is. People keep trying
to tell me that it's winter but
I'm sure that can't be right.
There's just so much sunshine
everywhere. Honestly.
Summery happy sunny tunes
making people smile and
dance madly: that's what
everyone should be listening to
now. It doesn't matter that it's
raining outside. It doesn't even
make me sad that the days are
long, dark and grey. Not with
the sunshine that keeps play-
ing from my stereo.
You may think I'm mad. The
eighth wonder of the world,
aka The Polyphonic Spree,
have enlightened my philoso-
phy of our dreary winter
nights. They dance, they smile,
they shine. How could 25 peo-
ple in white tunics shouting,
"Hello to the sun!" exist any-
where but summer?
Lemon Jelly are also spread-
ing the joy using their latest
box of happy treats, Lost
Horizons. It truly is an album
to make you warm inside.
Gentle electronica and rolling
instrumentals will have you
back in a summer meadow in
no time.
Then there's Athlete. Aw,
lovely little Athlete. "We
should be laughing about it,
making the most of the true
British climate", the cheery
Londoners advise. YOU MUST
BUY THIS. It will make you
smile; it will make the world
seem right. The hailstorms will
cease, the clouds will part and
the sun will shine down. Trust
me.
Don't be fooled by what
everyone says: now is the time
for summer. Thanks to the
likes of Simple Kid, A Million
Sons and Nightmares On Wax,
we need never be afraid of the
snowy months again.
