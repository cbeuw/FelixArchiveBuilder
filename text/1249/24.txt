It's been a tough week for your favourite edi-
tors. Deadlines, vivas and a distinct lack of
Felix editorial drinks have taken their toll,
which may explain the slightly shorter film sec-
tion. But I did manage to drag myself to an art-
house cinema. I'm not entirely sure about such
places. They always seem a little weird. The
Gate in Notting Hill is no exception. All the
beautiful people of Notting Hill queue up out-
side for ages before paying full London prices
for the privilege of sitting in an uncomfortable
seat positioned directly behind unnaturally tall,
wide men with hats on. There's no doubt the
theatre itself is beautiful, in that kitch gold-
spangly way that many auditoriums are, but
frankly when I'm paying 7 quid a pop I would
like to see more than half the screen, so a lit-
tle angling of the floor wouldn't go amiss. The
screen was smaller than your average Odeon,
and the sound system was the country bump-
kin cousin of Dolby Surround Sound, but since
I wasn't watching a blockbuster it didn't really
make a difference. However, as far as cinema
audiences go, they were fantastic. More used
to the kind of crowd who are smoking spliffs
before the trailers are through and laugh
throughout regardless of what's on, I was very
pleasantly surprised by the posh, wannabe-
Bohos. And they clapped at the end! I have
experienced this before, but only with Star
Wars, and that's different. Maybe there's
something in this arty lifestyle thing. I'm not
planning to move to Hoxton just yet, but I
might consider the occasional return to an art-
house cinema. Now I just have to find one
showing something I might actually want to
see... Liz
BFIeugh. This Week has been far too much
like hard work. I promise far more content next
week, but for now BOBBINS! Many thanks to
Liz for saving our asses two weeks running.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a bed to crawl
back into.

whether to take the piss out of the Yanks for
being that dumb or cry because these are the
people who populate (and run?) the last
remaining superpower.
Michael Moore could be seen as the equivalent
of our own Mark Thomas, a quirky bloke who
uses political satire and documentary-style
filming to get laughs. Except, this bloke is actu-
ally funny, and what's more, he says some pret-
ty important stuff in his new, Special-Jury-
Prize-at-Cannes-winning documentary on
schoolyard shootings in America.
The idea of going to see a 2-hour documen-
tary at the cinema (and a poncey art-house one
at that) did not inspire me that much, but I fig-
ured a 15-minute standing ovation at the
world's premier film festival must count for
something, so off I trotted. And I have to say, I
have never been so glad I ignored my gut
instincts. The film was utterly fantastic.
It began with a series of clips and interviews
establishing the ridiculous nature of America's
gun culture. Moore waltzed into a bank offering
a free gun with every account opened, where
the staff did not seem to share his concerns
about arming strangers inside a building con-
taining vast sums of money. Then he went for a
haircut, and got something for the weekend at
the same time. No party poppers here, nor con-
doms for that matter - the barber handed over
bullets for Moore's newly acquired gun. Cue
some footage of the "Michigan Militia" who
touted guns but couldn't do up their own belts,
and an interview with the brother of one of the
Oklahoma bombers (who himself was ques-
tioned, but let off for lack of evidence), and we
were all squirming in our seats and laughing
with that slightly incredulous, embarrassed
laugh. You know the one - you're not sure
An American. With a gun.
The laughs kept coming - a blind man with a
gun licence?! A man accidentally shot by a
dog?! Surely only in America. Well, yes, actual-
ly. That's the point Moore is making - only in
America. What the rest of the film tries to
answer is why America has over 11,000 gun
killings each year when other countries rack up
less than 200. He uses video footage, inter-
views and news clips to suggest the currently
favoured reasons behind such a huge death
toll, expertly, wittily denouncing each one,
mainly through reference to other countries
who face the same sociological evils (video nas-
ties, computer games and the beast everyone's
parents love to hate, Marilyn Manson). They
don't go around killing each other, why should
the Americans?
Combined with the sharp and humorous
social commentary is a more harrowing ele-
ment - the schoolyard killings of Columbine and
Buell. The use of actual CCTV images and real
911 calls is crushing - the audience's laughter
was quickly reversed to tears, and I actually felt
that cold wave of horror ripple through me.
Going from side-splitting to tear-jerking is not
easy, but Moore manages to do so smoothly,
retaining the narrative framework he has estab-
lished through the juxtaposition of images and
music. There is a little use of narration - the
expert editing and weaving together of snippets
of film from Moore's own investigation, news
reports and vox-pops requires little in the way
of augmentation.
The ideas and theories Moore presents are
generally sound and always thought-provoking.
There are a few instances where he seems to
lose his edge and appears to be almost playing
for laughs, something which detracts from his
otherwise precise comedy. There are also a few
cringe-worthy moments, including the inter-
view with pro-gun lobbying Charlton Heston,
who is stooped and frail as he dodders away
from an increasingly ardent Moore. Some
would argue that if Heston is to continue to head
the National Rifle Association, he ought to be pre-
pared to take on such discourses, but it was
uncomfortable to watch, especially in light of the
difficult emotional ride Moore had already orches-
trated. Nevertheless, a similar scene, where
Moore took two Columbine survivors to the con-
venience store where the bullets were bought,
was satisfying and heartening, a far cry from the
irritating guerrilla documentary making so often
seen.
Moore's film is intense, and a difficult cinema
experience, but it is also important and funny and
moving. Perhaps the laughter was harder and
louder because of the uncomfortable subject mat-
ter, the tears silent and shocking because of the
humour. I don't know, but I do know that this film
is spectacular. No special effects, no famous cast,
just a guy with something to say. And everyone
should listen.
