Comrades! J.I.Z. is alive. Alive and... calculating. Let's hope DHF does-
n't find out or he'll flip faster than an electron's spin in an applied mag-
netic field. Not that I haven't witnessed Fudge's alterego before... the
moon was brighter than a magnesium flare, and the blade was as cold
as Captain Birdseye's satchel; but that was another time, another place.
For now I am safe here in the bowels of Beit, nervously typing away this
rubbish until something comes to distract me. You will notice that J.I.Z.
has changed name from last week (it was originally G.I.Z.) under the
request of DHF, who asked, no, demanded that our artificial quiz play-
ing algorithm be more controversial to you sensitive readers. B.C.
Well Cyclops has spent the last week busying himself in the basement
of Bobby's boudoir. He claims he is creating J.I.Z.. I daren't ask. I'm
sorry for the incredibly nerdlinger-esque vibe that has taken over these
pages in recent weeks. I'm sure it was just you guys who used to be the
freaks. I've tried to stop it, but that big ball of puss and dandruff just
keeps gathering momentum. Ever since I went away I've noticed a
change in Cyclops. I can't quite put my fudge-finger on it, but there's a
definite stink in the air, and I'm not just talking about the stilton factory
in my underpants. Anyway, enough of this dribble and J.I.Z, just keep
sending in your answers and your pleas for bonuses and we'll keep ignor-
ing them. See yeh. H.F.
