Levellers
- T & C
Rain
— IC Union
T h e Sandkings support. The
Sandkings are early PWEI,
complete with megaphone, a
penchant for throwing drinks at the
crowd, and Definition Of Sound. I
didn't get where I am today without
knowing a good riff when I heard
it. M r . Sandking, seriously nuts.
The Levellers are like Waterboys
on speed, and make The Sandkings
seem restrained. Songs like Carry
Me and World Freak Show drive
the crowd wild. In fact every song
drives the crowd wild. A n d what a
crowd. Disgusting, dirty grebos,
one of them possessing a K e n Dodd
poster. M y kind of people. M y kind
of band. G o and see them, buy their
album, or failing that, lock up the
entire population of Hay wards
Heath.

River City People
—This is the World
The River City People's debut
album, Say Something Good,
preferably in its original format
without T H A T cover song, is one
of my favourite albums ever. Heaps
u p o n heaps o f g o o d songs,
Huskisson St., Walking On Ice,
Carry The Blame, makes it a
veritable classic. Search it out at
once, or any of the singles from it,
and believe. A s for the new album,
it's crap.

A s for elephants, they trumpet.
I think I'll stop now, and take one
of my pills. See you later.

Consolidated
—This is Fascism
Only once before have I felt this,
and now is the time for a dance
record to rumble along like a
Skorpion tank and viciously destroy
the mentality of the dance floor
a f i c i o n a d o s . Consolidated,
promoted as a 'White Public
E n e m y ' , take a good, long look at
their subservients and, as the fascist
floorshow ensues, squashes them
like beetles (Keep dancing to the
beat, say nothing, ask no questions,
G E T IN L I N E ! T h i s is Fascism).
Their line, a hard, burning
groove, etches itself around the idea
that fascist aggression is reborn, to
a certain extent, in dance culture.
It is by no means short of a
frightening vision of people so
subservient that they are sublimated
so easily. B u y i n g this c o u l d
maintain your self-control. Dance
to it, and you're lost.

Marc Cohn —Dominion Theatre
'the exquisite pain of being female',
from which I need a break.
M a r c C o h n , with his K e v i n
Costner life philosophy and James
Taylor concert technique will go far
because he embodies the best of
both and adds musical inspiration.
(Apologies to J T fans.) C o h n ' s
voice carries a thread of silver,
which along with its flexibility
makes him the best new male
vocalist for ages. M o r e variation in
his accompaniments would help -
both in style and media, but I like
what he does and I suppose he
knows which way his music is
going. A s long as he avoids the trap
of p a n d e r i n g to his current
audience's wishes he will be one of
this decade's true musicians.

Is it more blessed to praise than to
slag off? If the truth be known I
enjoyed the concert more than most
for the sheer melodicity of it.
I'll mention the support, T o r i
A m o s , mainly because I heard one
of her tracks played on Radio One
yesterday. She's more marketable
than I imagined. O K , she can sing,
but only 'in the style o f . Shut your
eyes and you could be listening to
Kate Bush, but her material is
restricted to the worn out topic of
Hole
— Teenage Whore
Oh goody. A spectacular vision of
anger, and I've always got a lot of
time for angry people. A s Teenage
Whore is taken from the album
'Pretty on the Inside', this writer
feels compelled to comment on the
irony h e r e i n . A l u m b e r i n g
avalanche of fucked-up noise guitar,
the caustic scream of venom like T
seen your repulsion and it looks real
good on y o u ' , and the rusted iron
touch of Sonic Youth's K i m Gordon
conspire to make a c o c k t a i l
s o m e w h a t lethal. T w o parts
h y d r o c h l o r i c a c i d , one part
mercury, ring the glass rim with
quick-lime. The stereo's playing
Hendrix and Sabbath slowed down
to 12 R . P . M . With L y d i a Lunch on
vocals. Sounds about right - Jesus,
it's bitter; the other songs are pretty
ugly too, more grim, monstrous
savagery from a strangely beautiful
woman called Courtney L o v e . She
used to sing with Faith No More,
you know. Sod the irony. Hole are
fucking with my head.
