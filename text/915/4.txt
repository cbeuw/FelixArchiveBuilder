Ents Bit Odds and Stuff
First of all—sorry to anyone who
was disappointed by the early finish
last Friday. Unfortunately we had
to close the disco door to avert
further violence after a couple of
fights broke out in the foyer. There
seems to be a core of people at IC
whose enjoyment of an evening is
not complete until they have picked
a fight with somebody. Sad people
indeed.
A n y w a y , it's Welfare Week,
which means much packing in of
smoking, cutting down on drinking
and renouncing of casual sex.
Amongst this general doom, gloom
and despondency, however, is a
small point of light—the Ents
Firstly, thanks to Bobo and the rest
of the band who played in the Union
L o u n g e B a r last S a t u r d a y .
Everyone enjoyed it and they are
invited back anytime. Next, what's
happening this coming week? There
are cocktails in the Union Bar from
7pm until 9pm tonight along with
the usual Ents evening. Tomorrow
sees the final of the Rugby W o r l d
C u p b e t w e e n E n g l a n d and
Australia. So the big screen will be
in the Ents lounge for anyone
wishing to see England romp home
to an astounding victory.
O n Thursday evening there's the
good old U n i o n General Meeting
( U G M ) . This is the major forum for
students policy at Imperial College
Union. It is held in the Concert Hall
at 6pm, not as listed in the
Handbook as the lounge (due to the
lounge having a fire limit 50 below
quorum—hopefully this should be
explained at the meeting if you
don't understand). T h e sabbaticals
and other officers give reports so if
y o u haven't seen a sabbatical yet
and want to then the U G M is a
pretty good bet. Other than reports
we have motions. These allow
students to set policy and mandate
the officers to do some work. They
are usually set out as three sections
1) I C U Notes—a list of facts
concerning the motion.
2) I C U Believes, and
3) I C U Instructs—a list of actions
to be carried out.
F o r example:
1) I C U N o t e s — T h e D e p u t y
President is small and annoying.
Welfare Week Comedy Club. After
all, what better way of feeling good
to the depths of your soul than by
having a right good laugh? The
Comedy Club features a whole load
of acts, from experienced T V
performers to nervous, gibbering
wrecks who have never been on
stage before in their lives. So you
know what that means—turn up and
give 'em hell, kids. Doors open at
9pm for a 9.30pm start—it's in the
U n i o n Lounge so seats are strictly
limited. Prices: £3, £1.50 to Ents
cardholders. A s usual, there's a late
bar and disco.

2) I C U Believes—The Deputy
President should be a strapping six
foot 2 inches with dark hair, so that
the President can get off with him.
3) I C U Instructs—The H o n Sec
(Events) as returning officer to
endeavour to implement I C U
Believes without breaking too many
election rules.
There is more to it, but that covers
the basics. Motions should be
submitted to the U n i o n Office by
2.30pm on Wednesday afternoon.
They should be proposed and
seconded by full members of the
union. Please bring your union card
or registration slip to the U G M .
O n Friday night there is the
Silwood Bonfire Party which costs
£4, and £3 for the coach there and
back. Tickets should be available
from the U n i o n Office by the time
you read this.
The following Saturday seems to
be another R a g D a y with a
Maidstone poppy day collection and
Leukaemia Research Pub C r a w l ,
check out today's Rag Meeting
(12.40pm U n i o n Lounge) for
details from Penguin.
Finally thanks to the C C U s for all
the free dinners last month and
putting up with my crap jokes.
Apologies to all the people who
turned up on M o n d a y for the Blues
Night, but the band didn't show due
to circumstances beyond the control
of the H o n Sec. I hope you enjoyed
the Sol promo though.

College D a y
A s you will have seen from last
week's Felix article, the working
party on the college day submitted
its final report to Board of Studies
last Wednesday. Although the
report c o n t a i n e d no
recommendations, it did contain
details o f a framework for a day
which involves starting at 9.00am,
lunch at 12.00pm, finishing at
6.00pm. Therefore the whole day
will be increased by one hour.
A l o n g with the framwork a set of
guidelines were included which
effectively prevented departments
from increasing the workload by
limiting the number of contact hours
in a day. It also recommended that
the longer day need not be taken by
all departments, those which have
no timetabling problems can choose
to have a day running from 10 'til
6 or from 9 'til 5. A s was not
reported last week (!?) the Board of
Studies did actually pass the
working parties framework along
with the relevant guidelines.
However, the agreement is that no
decision on timetabling can be made
until the students in each department
are consulted. That means that a
staff student committee will be able
to negotiate the method of use taken
by each department.

research students' which contains
details about your life at I C as a

given out when you first arrived but

distribution. It is very useful as it

F o l l o w i n g lengthy negotiations
between V a l Straw ( C o l l e g e
Facilities Manager) and Jonathan,
the sports centre has returned the
Canoe and D i v i n g club to their
relative correct times of using the
swimming pool. However, there
are still plans to improve the
facilities although no decisions have
been made yet. What we need is
your opinion on what changes you'd
like to see implemented so that we
may represent everyone the best
when it goes to a committee. There
isn't enought space in this Felix for
the questionnaire, so please come
