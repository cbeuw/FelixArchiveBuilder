Accident Prompts
Vehicle Ban
A l l vehicles are to be banned from
mascotry, it was decided o n
Monday. A meeting o f various
m e m b e r s o f the U n i o n a n d
Constituent College Unions ( C C U ) ,
including the executives decided
that since vehicles are 'harder than
even rugby players' they should be
totally excluded from mascotry.
The meeting was arranged before
the motor accident reported last
week, but it has figured largely in
their proposed future rules for
mascotry, designed to improve the
sport rather than ending it, as the
Rector, Sir E r i c , had proposed in
a letter.
T w o other major changes are also
mooted: firstly, mascots should be
put on inviolate display in college
departments. This means that they
may not be-stolen in a raid, but must
be taken to a minimum o f two C C U
events per term, and secondly,
during rag week the mascots will be
taken out every day. If stolen they
will be returned by midnight to
register one 'capture'. These will be
totalled at the end o f rag and a
mascot exchange effected (when
they will be inviolate). T h e most
stolen mascot will be awarded an
extra fine, payable to rag.
Other suggestions include a fixed
sum for violation o f a mascot. This
would be scaled relative to C C U
sizes. T h e R S M U is to be made
inviolate since their numbers are
depleted, and a complete set o f rules
are to be displayed in each C C U
office. This would be designed to
make sure participants realise that
they are responsible for their o w n
safety.
The proposals are to be discussed
this evening (Friday) at a meeting
of bearers, C C U V i c e Presidents
and C C U Presidents.

year. Posters advertising the
W e l f a r e W e e k a r r i v e d last
Thursday after problems arising
with the artwork, but they were not
put up until Monday and Tuesday
of this week.
Play Stopped
After Rain
Violence broke out in the U n i o n
Building last Friday night, after the
band ' R a i n ' played in the U n i o n
Lounge.
Graham Lawton, Ents chairman,
said a long running dispute between
students and people attracted to the
Union by Bar extensions had caused
the recent outburst o f violence. H e
continued by saying that security
will not intervene in disputes, but
will call the police. T h e individuals
involved are to face a disciplinary
committee next Friday.
Pyrotechnic
Party
T h e r e will be two fireworks
displays next week in Battersea.
T h e traditional display will take
place in Battersea Park S W 1 1 ,
while another will occur in K i n g
George's Park (off Garratt Lane)
simultaneously. The K i n g George's
P a r k display has h a d m u s i c
specially commissioned for it,
which was successfully used in
the Tooting firework display last
Saturday. Both bonfires will be lit
on the 5th November at 7.30pm
with the fireworks starting at
8.00pm
Lord
Mayor's
Show
O n Saturday 9th November, City
and G u i l d College U n i o n will be
participating in the L o r d M a y o r ' s
Show. This annual event marks the
change from the old to the new
M a y o r .
T h e show will start at about
11.00am at L o n d o n W a l l and will
follow a route through the City
passing St. Paul's, the Guildhall and
will stop at the Monument for lunch
at approximately 12.30pm. T h e
float will then return by a more
direct route to the starting point.
This year's float has models o f a
communications satellite and a
building from C a n a r y Wharf.
Traditionally, City and Guilds are
allowed a float for free whereas the
companies taking part have to pay.
Access to the route can be obtained
from either M o o r g a t e , Bank,
M a n s i o n House or M o n u m e n t
underground stations.
New Hon Sec
City and Guilds College U n i o n
( C & G U ) have a new Honorary
Secretary, following an election
held last Tuesday. Kate Dalton was
elected over Joanne B r o w n by 48
votes to 35.
T h e election could have been
declared void as the manifestoes
printed in Guildsheet broke election
regulations. T h e two contestants'
entries were not put in alphabetical
order, but as no objection has been
raised, the result still stands. J i m
Shaw, Guildsheet Editor, admitted
responsibility to printing the
manifestoes in the wrong order but
said that he felt it had not affected
the election and that, to his
knowledge, no action was being
taken by Joanne Brown to annul the
election.
No Parking
N o parking will be allowed on the
7th, 8th and 9th November from
Prince Consort road northwards to
Hyde Park. Loading, unloading and
setting down o f passengers will be
p r o h i b i t e d . T h i s is b e c a u s e
Remembrance Sunday events are to
be held nearby.
