Arson Alert Union in Dispute
A tire started in a lift in Southside
at about 2.00am last Saturday is
being treated as arson by the Police.
The arsonist is beleived to have lit
a small bonfire of plastic beer skiffs
in the lift at the bottom of its shaft.
A letter from D r . John Hassard,
warden of Southside Halls, said
forensic police beleived that had the
fire been discovered five minutes
later it would not have been put out.
A s it was, one end of the building
was filled with plastic fumes.
'According to one police expert
Southside would have been lucky to
escape without some people dead'
it was noted.
Residents are said to be 'furious'
at the lack of safety in the hall,
including faulty break-glasses,
missing fire extinguishers and only
one security guard instead of the
agreed two.
M r Terry Briley, of IC security,
said that the event was 'in no way
accidental... the toxic fumes could
have carried off residents'. T h e
Police are still investigating the
incident and M r Briley told Felix
that he hoped peer pressure would
bring the culprit forward. T would
be grateful for any information', he
said.
Daniel Shields, the treasurer of the
Social, Cultural and Amusements
Board ( S C A B ) , has resigned after
a dispute with the U n i o n . S C A B is
one of the major sub-committees
( M S C ) of the U n i o n , and the
executive of each M S C must sign
a document in which they are held
liable for fiscal losses incurred by
the M S C ' s constituent clubs.
Without a S C A B treasurer, no
S C A B society can buy equipment
or deposit money. Some societies
have refused to give cash to the
Union until their banking priveleges
are returned to them. Societies

Linstead Food Fight
Student residents in Linstead Hall
are complaining about the price of
their evening meal, provided by the
hall. The warden, D r Jan Bradley,
told Felix that she considered the
meals to be much better than last
year, although the students do not
feel that the improvement in quality
merits the 40 pence price increase
imposed. T h e meals now cost
Â£2.95.
T h e warden said that students are
not able to opt out of the system if
they wish to eat a meal ouside the
hall. They have no means of
recouping the money lost on these
meals, and their meal is cooked
regardless. A c c o r d i n g to a recent
poll in the hall, about 2 5 % of the
food is wasted during the term
because of people not being there
to eat it. T h e students have an
option of taking a pack lunch with
them, but this option is only offered
on Wednesdays and Fridays. T h e y
would much rather be recompensed
with money.
The residents have sought redress
for this p r o b l e m by sending
c o m p l a i n t s to C o l l e g e
administration. D r Bradley said that
students 'are not getting terribly far
with the administration,' and
according to one student they have
'contacted everyone possible.... and
sent loads of letters,' but have been
given the 'run-around'.
affected include F i l m S o c , Jazz and
R o c k C l u b , the Orchestra, the
Operatic Society, and the Dramatic
Society.
M r Shields claimed that U n i o n
bureaucracy held back his role as
treasurer and during a heated S C A B
meeting yesterday, both M r .
Shields and Jonathan Griffiths,
U n i o n Deputy President, defended
their positions. Zayeed A l a a m ,
S C A B chairman, hoped that M r .
Shields would act as treasurer until
a replacement could be found and
that he could be persuaded to
withdraw his resignation.
Zoe Hellinger, U n i o n president,
has offered a compromise, in that
M r Shields can write his own
declaration and submit it for
approval to the Union. M r Griffiths
told Felix that he had not heard of
this, and that as all other M S C
treasurers had signed it, why should
M r Shields be different? Steve
Newhouse, Chair of the Social
Clubs Committee ( S C C ) told Felix
that he had not been asked to sign
the document, and nor had his
treasurer, M a r k Randall.
