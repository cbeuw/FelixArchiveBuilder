T w o weeks. It's now only two
weeks. O n l y two weeks until
college is plunged deep into chaos,
with the long awaited arrival of Rag
Week.
Seeing as there is a good chance
that you probably don't know what
all of the events are, even if you
have been here for more than a
year, I'll give you a quick run
down. T o start with, you must
realise that because it's Rag Week
none of the events are named very
well, maybe that's something to
alter for next year. Regardless, find
out what they are. D o n ' t just rely
on the name, you could miss out on
a storming event. A n y w a y the
largest events are as follows:
• Friday 15th - Guilds Carnival. A s
a kick off to R a g W e e k we couldn't
really do better than this. Taking
over the U n i o n Building in a
manner similar to that at the end of
Freshers' W e e k , the C a r n i v a l
promises to be huge this year. It's
nof really a carnival, it's an event.
L i v e bands, casino and disco. It's
going to be big.
• M o n d a y 18th - Mines Dirty
Disco. T h e less you wear, the less
you pay to get in. A n d yes quite a
few get in for free. However it is
up to you. If just wearing a tie to
a disco isn't your thing, then wear
the whole suit. At the end of the day
the choice is yours, but make sure
you come along as it's always a
great laugh.
• Wednesday 20th - R C S Beer
F e s t i v a l . T h i s event is self
explanatory. Loads of people come
into the Junior C o m m o n R o o m
(JCR) in Sherfield and drink loads
of different beers. It's the largest
n o n - C A M R A beer festival in
Britain and it's deliberately on
Wednesday so everyone can spend
all afternoon and most o f the
evening drinking. Y o u ' l l have to
buy the beer glass with this year's
logo on and it'll also be your first
chance to buy one of this year's Rag
Mags, they're great. T u r n up, if not
to buy beer then to buy a Rag M a g .
• T h u r s d a y 21st - H y p n o s i s
Lecture. It's amazing. Every year
we pack the Great H a l l (it's the
biggest room we can find). If
you've been before you'll know to
come again, if not come because
there's nothing like it. A g a i n , it's
nof really a lecture, it's a Hypnosis
Show. It's a show in two halves (so
you can grab a quick pint from the
U n i o n in the middle). Firstly,
R o c k S o c , D r a m a t i c Soc and
Operatic Soc as well as cabaret and
novelty acts from other keen
participants. It's an excellent
evening, really enjoyable and well
worth going to.
This isn't all that's happening
during Rag Week. O n Saturday it's
the giant Rag Raid and on Sunday,
the hopeful trolley race around
H y d e P a r k (still a w a i t i n g
to do a sponsored something, come
to the Rag meeting today in the
Union lounge at 12.40pm and we'll
authoris.; you a sponsorship form.
This includes the S N K P J (see
above).
As it's now only two weeks
away, we arc obviously getting
frantic. A n y help that you can give
would be greatly appreciated, be it
from manning a door at a major
Two Weeks To Go
Martin S Taylor, a professional
hypnotist, gives a humorous talk on
hypnosis in general, then in the
second half demonstrates just what
he's been on about.
• Friday 22nd - The Smoking
Concert Cabaret. W e just couldn't
close Rag Week with an event better
than this. It's a refined combination
of the best that IC students have to
offer. Including acts from Jazz and
permission); on Tuesday it's the
Slave Auction, the Charity Auction
and Bar Quiz and on the Saturday
after it's the Sponsored Nude
Kamikaze Parachute Jump. If you
don't know what this is yet, find out
by phoning 3402 and ask for
Gordon. There are already a great
number of people doing sponsored
events during the week and if you
see them, sponsor them. If you want
event or just helping with the
stupidities. Just give your name and
dept to your Soc Rep, Hall Rep or
put a note in my pigeon hole in the
Union Office. So now's the time to
Be M a d , Be Silly & Be Part of It!

C h a i r 91/92.
Last weekend saw I C U R a g raise
another thousand pounds or greater
for charity, as was managed in the
three weekends previously. The
amount raised, £1,330.76 came
from two independent collections.
The first was on Friday afternoon
when students from IC headed off
into the prosperous part of the city
on the City of London Pub C r a w l .
It was shown that the decision to
collect from the city's business
community in the afternoon was a
wise one, when at the end of the day
£655.72 had been raised for
U N I C E F , the U n i t e d Nations
Children's Fund. T h e day's top
collector was Tamsin Braisher who
raised £270.78. Her collecting
partner, Stuart Rison, attributed this
to 'the rich businessmen putting the
money in her Rag C a n instead of
mine saying that they'd rather give
it to the girl with the nice legs!'
The second collection was on
Sunday, when students, all in fancy
dress, went amongst the buskers in
Covent Garden Market and raised
£675.04 for I C U Rag's chosen
charities. This year these charities,
who also benefit from the money
raised during Rag Week, include
Multiple Sclerosis, B I B I C , W W F ,
Turning Point and a selection of
Local Charities.
These two collections were then
added to by the £83.53 brought
back by a team of three selling old
Rag Mags while on a week's tour
of Britain's other universities. This
takes the weekend total to an
amazing £1,413.87, making the
overall total for the year so far a
staggering £14,146.64. Last year
Rag raised in the region of £32,400.
There are three more major
collections before Rag Week:
A n o t h e r c o l l e c t i o n at C o v e n t
Garden on Sunday; a Poppy Day
c o l l e c t i o n in M a i d s t o n e next
Saturday and a Leukaemia Research
Pub C r a w l on the same afternoon
and evening. This means that
reaching half of last year's total
before Rag W e e k starts is a very
realistic target.
This year Rag is very big and
loads of fun. So get involved now
and give them a hand on one of their
collections, especially the Pub
C r a w l .
