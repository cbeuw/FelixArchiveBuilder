Selective questions distort sense
Dear Editor,
Re. T h e College D a y
A s chairman of the working party
whose report was discussed by the
Board o f Studies o n 23 October,
may I correct some factual errors
in the report in your issue o f 25
October?
1. W e (the working party) reminded
the board that 'last session student
opinion was strongly opposed to an
extension of teaching hours' (which
shows that we were aware o f the
various referenda), but said that 'we
know o f no systematic expression
of students' views this session.'
W e also wrote that 'students (and
indeed staff) will need to be
consulted about the details o f the
implementation'. Y o u r selective
quotations distort the sense of what
we wrote.
2. The main reason for considering
the change was to make it easier for
departments to arrange the choice
of subjects that many students want
and/or need. Last session, the board
was inclined to make the change,
but deferred a decision until it had
the best estimates that could be
made o f the cost.
3. T h e Managing Director, who
assured us that the cost would be
'next to nothing', is Angus Fraser;
Gordon Marshall is the Director of
Estates.
4. T h e board d i d not defer a
decision until 11 December or any
other date; it decided that the new
hours will operate from October
1992 (subject to various conditions
stated in our report), and that each
academic department should consult
its o w n students about the
introduction o f the new hours.
Yours sincerely,
S. A. V. Swanson.
Some points are worth making
concerning the above letter.
1. I'm glad you're 'aware' of
the various referenda. It rather
begs the question as to what the
point of such referenda are since
the College intends to ignore their
outcome. Also, claims that you

'know of no systematic expression
of students' views this session' are
irrelevant. This makes no
difference to the meaning of the
quote. Are you saying that despite
knowing the views of last year's
students, this year's students
suddenly think differently?
2. Have a l l staff been
consulted? Have the trade
unions? They will have to work
longer hours.
3. True. Sorry, though I think
that commenting that Gordon
Marshall is the Director of Estates
rather than M D is rather petty.
The sentence may be ambiguous,
but it isn't wrong.
4. True. This is a factual
inaccuracy for which I apologise.
In our defence, we tried to
confirm the story with a number
of people including the Union
Office none of whom were in. The
story was based on a slightly out
of date document, but none of us
are prescient so without
independent confirmation
mistakes are made.

Sports centre
Dear Sirs.
I am writing to you to draw your
attention to events concerning the
Sports Centre over the past six
months.
F i r s t l y the plans f o r the
rebuilding of the Sports Centre and
Southside G y m were not made
available to the South Kensington
Sports C o m m i t t e e until the
architects had presented version 6,
despite the fact that the South
Kensington Sports Committee is the
body set up by the Governing Body
in 1968 to be the management
committee of the sporting facilities
at South Kensington. T h e brief
given to the architects by Valerie
Straw still has not been made
available for discussion or comment
despite the fact that it is obviously
of interest to the S K S C and
originally included the removal o f
the Rifle Range. This idea was only
scrapped after I suggested that
Valerie Straw look at the college's
obligations under the 1954 Landord
and Tenant A c t and the 1938
Defence o f the Realm Act.
Secondly at the joint meeting o f
the college athletics committee and
S o u t h K e n s i n g t o n Sports
Committee the architects plans were
finally shown and a great deal o f
disquiet shown to the proposed
changes. T h e reasoning behind
these changes, we were informed
by Gordon Marshall, was 'to appeal
to the middle-aged executive' and
when I pointed out that the Sports
Centre was for the students here, he
said ' O h , I a m sure they will like
it as well'.
Because o f a lack o f time the
paper tabled by Valerie Straw on
new a d m i s s i o n c h a r g e s a n d
membership had only a brief airing.
W h e n I questioned the need for a
'membership' charge and that the
revenue gained thereby would be
better a n d f a i r l y r a i s e d b y
increasing existing charges using
the existing structure the only reply
I got which could be considered as
having the same argument as the
counterargument was 'well, I like
it' (membership). W h e n Harry
Knutton ( C . A . C . chairman) decided
a m e e t i n g to d i s c u s s this
m e m b e r s h i p issue w o u l d be
necessary and would be called in
September, G o r d o n Marshall said
'we are going to do it anyway'.
I have written to the Rector twice
on the issue o f 'membership' at the
Sports Centre and the only reply on
who is empowered to make such
decisions, Valerie Straw as facilities
manager o r the Governing B o d y ' s
Committee, was that the college had
not yet broken the law.
The final straw of this saga is the
cancellation of the joint C A C S K S C
meeting on M o n d a y 28th October
by Valerie Straw to allow a
complete rethink o n the plans. I
thought that it was the j o b o f the
secretary, John Vandridge-Ames to
convene and cancel meetings not
hers. It may be coincidence but
another architect, M r Geoffrey
D a r k e s o f G e o f f r e y D a r k e s
Associates, a well respected and
award winning practice, was due to
have his feasibility study and plans
tabled at this meeting. This means
that when the final plans are decided
upon there will be very little
discussion because the deadline for
contracts etc is the e n d o f
December, if work is going to start
in the summer o f 1992.
I a m willing to make available
both architects plans and all other
correspondence on this matter in my
possession to any interested party.
Yours faithfully,
Nick Roy all, Non-Teaching Staff
Rep,
South Kensington Sports
Committee.
