Quit
Biackett Is there anyone
blackened there?
Dear Adam,
C o n c e r n i n g the P h y s i c s
Department's smoking p o l i c y ,
revised at the beginning of this year.
Before I start a torrent of abuse
from poor, oppressed smokers and
from other students who believe
they have a right to avoid passive
smoking, let me say that (a) I
smoke, (b) I agree that no one
should have to inhale my second-
hand smoke.
It used to be the case (last year)
that all of Biackett was non-smoking
apart from one of the two c o m m o n
rooms (and I use this term in a fairly
broad sense—it was a room with
one table, some padded chairs and
ashtrays). But it served the purpose;
you could cut the atmosphere in
there with a chainsaw but with the
exception of one or two blind and
deaf individuals who couldn't see
the signs, no one smoked anywhere
else and so all the smoke remained
in a confined area. If you didn't
want to passively smoke you just
didn't go down there.
O v e r the s u m m e r , w o r d
processors were installed down
there—a valuable facility, useful to
all students and not one which the
department wishes to have fag ash
sprayed over. Perfectly reasonable,
then, to move the smoking area. It
is now in the foyer on level 2, a
completely open-plan area which
everyone must walk past to get to
their c o m m o n room. T h e smoke
Dear Adam,
Is there any intelligent life out
there?
I am not talking about the
universe as a whole, but IC in
general. A s you know, one of your
lead stories (Super Plug: Issue 914)
was false. W e l l , I knew it was
because I helped create it, but was
Felix inundated with complaints,
queries or requests for patent
details, no!
This didn't surprise me because
I thought IC as a whole had seen
through this blatant journalistic
ruse. However, during the last few
days I have found more people who
have been taken in by it.
I can only draw two conclusions
from this: Everybody in college has
forgotten their ' O ' Level Physics or
that p e o p l e b l i n d l y b e l i e v e
everything they read in print. I
honestly don't know which of these
is more worrying, a complete
breakdown of secondary school
science teaching or the jaded minds
now drifts all over the place.
Smoking may be out of fashion
and we may be in a minority, but
trying to eradicate it by stopping
people smoking in Biackett is not
really going to work.
In their defence, I will say that I
haven't a clue where else a smoking
that don't think about what they
read.
Felix is never 100% accurate
(sorry A d a m the truth is out), but
neither is any other newspaper,
journal or similar publication. News
and research can be biased by
opinions or just plain wrong and
should always be approached with
healthy scepticism.
M a n y graduates from IC will
either do research or take up jobs
where the assessment of written
reports is a crucial part of the
d e c i s i o n m a k i n g p r o c e s s .
Considering the number of people
fooled by a story made up in thirty
minutes, what hope have they of
spotting a deliberate scientific hoax
when one next comes along?
Yours sincerely,
Steven Newhouse.
P.S. W h o would believe that an
Electrical Engineering graduate
could look like A l e c Baldwin
anyway?
area could go in Biackett, but we
are now only one step away from
shoving every smoker out onto
Prince Consort Road for a quick fag
between lectures. I suppose it is a
nice, big open space.
Yours,
Paul Davison, Physics 2.
Dear Editor,
W h y is nothing at the Q T priced?
Is it asking too much to know how
much we will be asked to pay. The
o n l y items p r i c e d are the
sandwiches and hot foods. W h y are
there not prices for the large range
of crisps, nuts, flapjacks and
confectionery?
I am not suggesting that every
item should have a price tag, just
the boxes that the products are
presented in.
I presently p u r c h a s e quite
frequently from the Q T , but this
lack of pricing is getting to me. I
think that in future I will purchase
less flapjacks, crisps and drinks
than I do at present, since I feel that
the price that I pay at the till varies
from day to day.
T h e union image has certainly
improved over the last year or
two—especially the bookshop and
Q T . The improved service provided
is very much appreciated—could
this improvement be extended to
pricing the products you expect us
to pay for.
Yours,
Dave Amin.
The Union doesn't run the QT
snack bar. Thus the reason for no
prices is because College wants to
pull a fast one on you again.
Legally all items should have a
price on them or there should be
displayed a price list with a
description of the item and its
price. The item should be easy to
identify from the price list.
—Adam.
Invent a
The Hub Office
invites you to
invent a toy.
This term at IC you have three B i g
C h a n c e s . T o M a k e a C h i l d
Happier. T o M a k e a M a r k at IC.
T o M a k e some money when you
need it most.
H o w to do it? Enter the IC
Christmas competition to invent,
make, create a toy. Entries are
accepted in two categories: funny
or serious. The First is for a toy that
will make a child laugh or purr with
pleasure. T h e Second is for a toy
that will demonstrate how some part
of the universe works—that's
right—a scientific principle. There
is a prize of £200 for each category.
The toy must be a finished object,
robust enough for demonstration at
the Christmas Caper and in local
primary schools in the Pimlico
project by I C students on
Wednesday afternoons next term.
A n y o n e who needs access to
workshop facilities can contact
Chris Gerrard on Ext 6122. He's at
the student's workshop where the
model club meets on Tuesday
evening.
Entries must be submitted by
Thursday 28 November, 6pm at the
H u b Office, Sherfield, or by
midnight to the messenger desk on
S h e r f i e l d G r o u n d F l o o r . A l l
students and staff are eligible to
enter as an individual or as a group.
Judging will take place at the
C h r i s t m a s C a p e r on S u n d a y
afternoon December 1st in the
Consort Gallery. Entrants must
attend to watch children test drive
the toys and to answer questions
that the judges may ask. The judges
will be Professor Richard Gregory,
Founder and Director of the Bristol
Exploratory, Professor Helen Haste
o f B a t h U n i v e r s i t y , a toy
m a n u f a c t u r e r a n d , weather
permitting, our alumni announcer,
Breakfast T i m e ' s Frances Wilson.
Y o u could make money even if
you don't win because all the
competition entries will be exhibited
the first week in December in
Sherfield and may be priced for
sale. In any case you'll have a
personal critique with one of the
country's leading lateral thinkers
and the director of an internationally
famous toy maker.
