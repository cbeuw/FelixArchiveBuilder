Footballing Heroes
O n S u n d a y O c t o b e r 2 7 t h ,
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e A s s o c i a t i o n
Football C l u b fielded two sides in
the U L U 6-a-side tournament at
Motspur Park. T h e y got off to an
electrifying start with Stuart Watson
playing some good football down
the line - the express training really
showed!
The 1st team took a little time in
getting accustomed to the 6-a-side
tactics, and went down 3-0 in their
first game against the Royal Free
Hospital. However all hope was not
lost since the qualifying groups
were the best of three matches. So
against Middlesex, the performance
improved, with a hammering 4-0
win. A fine header from Watson
opened the scoring, with additional
goals from Telis Boltioz, Ruban
Ranachandran and M a r v A b d o .
Paul Nelson can feel unlucky about
not getting on the score sheet after
his header was saved on the line by
the opposing centre-back. T h e
resulting penalty was taken by
Nelson himself, and although the
divot was unstoppable as it rocketed
into the top corner, the ball
unfortunately proved a formality for
the Middlesex keeper.
The final group match for the
lst's was against St Georges and
was won 2-1 by Imperial, both
goals coming from A b d o , who
really shone as the low sun caught
his forehead. Merciful Martin
Atherton tried very hard to bring St
Georges back into the game by
throwing the ball into his own net,
but to no avail.
The 2nd's had a more convincing
start to their group, beating Charing
Cross easily 2-0, with fine goals
from Chris Collison followed by a
gem of a dig by new boy Richie
D i x o n , who had a brilliant day in
midfield. (The message is - mind
out!) New College (the eventual
winners) provided stiffer opposition
and the 2nd's were narrowly beaten
1 -0 due to a Rax Muthoo error and
some blistering New College pace.
However the 2nd's secured their
place in the knockout stages by
stuffing S O A S 2-0, with Collison
getting his second for the day and
one from A n d y Stanniland.
So onto the quarter-finals with the
lst's playing Baits. A very tight
contest settled by a single goal from
an even tighter player, Annan
Galloway, who finally opened his
account. A l l credit to Watson who
got tired towards the end. The 2nd's
quarter-final was a thriller against
Goldsmiths, with Stanniland getting
a timely goal with Muthoo also
troubling the scorers. A great deal
of praise should go to Steve
Shilling, who made hundreds of
match winning saves to secure the
2nd's semi-final place.
In the semi-final Imperial lst's
played New College who had
previously beaten our 2nd's 1-0 in
the qualifying stages. B y this time
fitness was telling and the New
College extra pace and organisation
ensured a 2-0 lead. Imperial were
unlucky not to get one back as
Galloway thumped the cross bar
and T o m R o b s o n was really
smokin', but sadly things didn't go
our way, and the game ended 2-0
to New College.
The 2nd's semi-final against U C L
was a real nail-biter as we took the
lead from a Collison penalty,
however a Muthoo error allowed
U C L back into the game. It then
took another fine performance by
Shilling to keep the scores level
until full time. T h e game went
straight to penalties which was a
thrilling contest, and eventually
g o i n g U C L ' s way 6 - 5 . O u r
sympathy goes out to Willie John
M c K n i g h t who missed the deciding
penalty but had proved to be a good
6-a-side tactitioner previously that
day.
The U L U 6-a-side tournament
was a great success for Imperial
who can take much pride in getting
both their sides to the semi-finals,
and providing some great football
on the way. W e all learned a lot
from the day, in particular that
E a m m a n M c C a n n and P h i l
Caldwell run funny, and that the
K h y b e r Pass is b e t w e e n
Afghanistan and Pakistan; in fact
the only unanswered question is
how can Galloway be so ugly when
the rest of his family are not? W e
needn't toss a coin to acknowledge
Shilling as IC's most important
player, although everybody played
extremely well, and have given the
rest of the league a lot to think about
when they play us this year. M a r v
A b d o and R a x M u t h o o , the
respective 1st and 2nd team
captains, must be very confident
about the forthcoming season.
Talkback
Well after much grovelling, I finally
persuaded A d a m to give me a
column of my own, to express my
own views on life, and fill your
minds with more interesting drivel.
Hopefully, this may become a
regular item in the Clubs and
Societies pages, allowing me to let
off steam.
O K , for starters, last M o n d a y ,
there was I, sitting in the Felix
office, hoping someone would walk
in and place something in either of
the 'Sports Results' or the 'Clubs
and Societies' pigeon holes. Getting
rather fed up by the lack of input,
especially by the A C C clubs, I
ambled back to my o w n room, and
wrote out a letter directed towards
these clubs. However by the time
I had mailed all the letters, my
telepathic thoughts seemed to have
had the desired effect, with a deluge
of results and reports being handed
in.
So, if you received a letter, but
have handed me some info, then
ignore it. Otherwise, if you are the
captain/chairman/commodore/se-
cretary of a club, then please try to
let me know of any forthcoming
events or the results from previous
weeks. This is after all the magazine
for Imperial students, and it would
be nice if we could report on the
happenings of clubs affiliated to
Imperial. A n d furthermore, this is
the fastest, cheapest and easiest
method o f getting a message
through to a large audience
(membership).
Sometime in the future, I would
like to bring back the results table
that (for those who remember) used
to be a regular feature a few years
back. This would involve all the
teams f r o m each A C C c l u b
submitting their individual results,
p r e f e r a b l y b e f o r e M o n d a y
lunchtime (that's 12.30-1.30pm
folks, if you've forgotten). N o
detailed report is necessary,
although this may be a good idea for
a major event such as U A U
matches. A n d a favourable result
need not be the only occasion that
a result be submitted. However, if
the response of the rugby captain is
anything to go by, (several invisible
p r o m i s e d s u b m i s s i o n s - still
forgetting huh?) this may be a long
term prospect, rather than one
happening very soon.
Felix has at its disposal, several
photographers, who are very
willing to accompany Clubs to any
event. S o , if y o u r e q u i r e
photographs for any occasion,
please get in touch with either
myself or A d a m , and we'll see if a
photographer is available to tag
along. This also spices up the rather
drab look of the recent Clubs pages,
which have been rather sparse of
photos.
With the end of the first month
of term, and the beginning of
November, it seems that these pages
have mainly been aimed by Clubs
to advertise for greater
membership, especially among the
female p o p u l a t i o n . C e r t a i n l y
activities such as shooting, ten pin
bowling and snooker require no
extra physical ability - so come on
girls, get your act together and join
in. These Clubs are there for
Y O U R benefit, to enable Y O U to
enjoy yourselves and relieve the
tension from all those lectures and
course work.
If you have any comments about
this, or any other issue regarding
the clubs and societies of Imperial,
then please don't hesitate to write
to me or A d a m , and we'll print the
more eloquent letters. Finally, with
England playing Australia in the
R u g b y W o r l d C u p final this
weekend, I'd like to wish the lads
all the best, and hope they hammer
the Aussies.
