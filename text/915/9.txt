Tenpin
IC Tenpin Bowling C l u b began
their season with a 7-3 match
victory over Essex University at
Colchester. Helen Adams battled
bravely in the ladies team, despite
being o u t n u m b e r e d 4 : 1 , but
eventually had to concede defeat.
T h e C team p r o d u c e d a
m a g n i f i c e n t p e r f o r m a n c e by
winning, despite being a man short.
Both Matt Bell (400 series) and
Dave Williams (385) bowled above
average in carrying the team to
victory. The B team rallied well
after losing the first game to
t r i u m p h 3 - 1 , w i t h W a y n e
W h i t e m a n p r o v i d i n g the
inspiration. Congratulations to D o n
Taverner for avoiding the ignominy
of bowling below a blind score with
his final game rally.
The A team recovered well to
snatch a 2-2 draw with the last
frame of the match. The match was
clinched with a gutsy last frame
performance by super Captain Pete
Sharpe, obtaining his first double
strike of the day to nose ahead of
the opposing team.
The team now go on to play Kent,
away, on the 16th November. If
there are any female bowlers out

Boat Club
Last weekend saw the first major
competition of the boat club's
calendar, which took place at the
infamous regatta course of Henley-
Upon-Thames. The event, termed
the 'Upper Thames Head O f The
River', was entered by 8 fours and
produced a fair amount of success
for Imperial. In particular wins
were recorded in the Senior 3,
Senior 2 and Novice classes, with
a further 3 second placings attained
as well.
The Novice-coxed four (Myers,
Puttick, Florence and Chadia)
repeated the success of last year,
and in all we had quite a successful
day out. H o w e v e r , any new
members are still welcome to join
the club - whether they are
beginners or national squad rejects!
For more information, please get
in touch with the captain, Lawrence
Morgan, M e c h E n g III.

Rifle Club
Wedne day 23rd of October saw
this years first "fun shoot", a skittle
blasting competition. The object
was to shoot 5 ten pin bowling
skittles off a table as fast as
possible. This was many people's
first chance to try the big (.44) guns
and much fun was had throughout
the afternoon. The winner was
N a t h a n with a time o f
approximately 15 seconds and if he
comes down to the range sometime
he can collect his prize of a double-
edge sword.
This was the first of many fun
shoots we hope to run which will
include skate blasting, clay pigeon
shooting (with a difference), more
skittle shooting and possibly even
a b u g hunt (you k n o w ,
biomechanical alien monstrosities
with acid for blood). A l l events are
held in the rifle range which is in

This was another of those games
that we should have won, but in the
end were lucky not to lose. T h e
most enjoyable aspect from a
spectators point of view must surely
have been watching the captains
hand grow in size!
The complex looked like a building
designed by a mad architect. It

walkways, glass passages and lifts
piled up on top of each other with
other pieces o f c o n s t r u c t i o n
rammed halfway into the mess.
Kerplunk before the marbles fall.
' C o m e on in. T h e executives are
waiting for y o u . '
They walked into the entrance
and the guide pulled out an
electronic box.
'What's that?'
'It's an execdetec, an executive
detector. Due to security reasons it
is impossible to find anyone you
want in this building. The signs are
misleading and will only lead to
confusion and anyone you ask will
be subconsciously triggered to stare
blankly at you, mumble something
and walk off. The only way to find
someone is by using this.'
The guide displayed the box to
Stress. A pretty pattern of buttons,
embellished with logoglyphics sat.
underneath a small circular radar
screen. The guide turned the box
away, pressed a button and strode
off down the corridor. T h e y
followed its mazelike path until they
reached the bottom of a spiral
staircase and ascended into the heart
of the complex.
The staircase spiralled up among
boxes, platforms, walkways and
tubes that receded into the distance
in all directions. Light filtered
through the frosted glass of the
dome and lit up the construction like

' U h , thanks.'
'It's wonderful of you to visit us.'
'Yeah, I wonder if y o u . '
' A n d I'm sure y o u ' l l be happy to
help us with a good cause.'
' W e l l , uh, certainly. What is it?'
' W e ' d like to experiment on
y o u . '
'What!'
see our humanitarian, caring society
won't allow cruel experiments on
its citizens. But you'll do fine!'
'I'm human!'
'If you were you wouldn't object
to the self sacrifice and if you're not
we don't need your permission. D o
what's required, P s D L m C Q s T . '
The guide grabbed Stress with his

for a while, rising up above the
mess via tunnels and stairs and
bridges until they arrived at a small
door. The guide knocked.
' C o m e i n . '
T h e y walked into a plush,
windowless office with unholstered
leather chairs and a large oak desk.
Sitting behind it was a man of
similar make to the guide, another
model with greater mileage.
'Welcome, visitor, to the central
complex.'
The executive was wearing an
enormous smile that extended right
across his face. Stress had visions
of the edges meeting at the back and
severing his head.
'Not very nice experiments but
it's for a good cause.'
'I don't think I...'
Stress backed away from the
executive and bumped into the
guide.
' Y o u mean you don't want to
help save lives?'
'It's not that.'
' Y o u ' d rather be selfish and
cowardly and let others die to
protect yourself!'
'But why me?'
' O h , well. Y o u see you're not
human. Y o u may look pretty human
but we know you're just an
unimportant creature. W e ' r e pretty
lucky you turned up actually. Y o u

towards him, holding a needle.
Naval chemical inducers in Stress's
body, triggered by the panic
signals, suppressed the cerebral
a c t i v i t y and s i g n a l l e d a
subconscious reaction maneouvre.
Stress snapped forward and down,
sending the guide over his head to
crash into the executive. H e
grabbed the execdetec off the desk
before turning around and escaping
out the door.
