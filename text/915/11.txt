—Tin Machine II
This is upsetting. Having hated
virtually everything yer man David
has p r o d u c e d since 1980's
marvellous Scary Monsters, I found
myself longing to like this, to be
astonished by the thrilling and
unprecedented return of a primal
genius. I was about six or seven
when the re-released Space Oddity
went to N o . 1; a role model for
every alienated kid, the name Major
Tom was enough to send shivers
throughout my head. A n d keep
them there. T i n Machine 11 is
diabolical.
So maybe I'm the last in the
queue to kick Bowie's mynstrelles,
I did want to be objective, fair, all
that - until now, that is, now I've
decided to administer boot to groin
in time-honoured fashion. Yeah, it's
sad, but this record stinks. It's
bloated p o m p - m e t a l - g o t h and
sounds too smug by half. N o matter
how many favours I could try to
give it, there is very little here that
rises above the level of atrocity, and

The Other Way To Work
Right then. If y o u ' d been listening
to me in last week's issue, then I'd
have seen you at the Falcon last
Wednesday. I didn't see you, did I?
If I did, please ignore the next piece
of the review. Y o u bastards, why
do you never listen to me? I tell you
that they're the best new band I've
heard in six months, and you ignore
me. Well, I went to see them, and
they were better. Yes, better. What
do you mean, you don't like good
bands? I don't care. Get along to the
East L o n d o n poly on the 9th
November, and see them then. I
demand a sell out gig.
Through a seven song support
set, Herb bring light into one of the
dingiest, most well hidden venues
in London, (yes, even more so than
the Borderline). A s for the songs,
my p e r s o n a l f a v o u r i t e s are
Marzipan, and Popsicle, but no
song could really stand out from
such a great set. G o and see them,
right now!
GNE7 Stop picking such a good
support band, and you'll appear
much better.

so accordingly, I will not waste
space on shit like Baby Universal,
Big Hurt. Goodbye Mr. Ed, on the
other hand, is just about the only
good yardstick by which to judge
the piss-poor. Shopping for Girls,
Amlapura You belong in rock n 'roll
simply fail to end decently, too
much is bluff embellishments on a
very insubstantial carcass, yet
Goodbye Mr. Ed is quite lovely,
Dave deadpanning with an almost
moving gentleness. But that, as such
as it is known, is 'it'. A n d there's
nothing more to be said.
So now you know what happened
to the man who haunted himself and
millions of others, the man who can
lay claim to punk/goth and synth-
pop/new romantic. When it was his
time, Bowie was ahead of it. N o w ,
he sounds like a regressive, twenty
years too late, an ailing, tired, and
very, very old sod. Die quietly,
David.

World of Twist
— Quality Street
Quality Street has its moments, and
I'm going to resist making a remark
about a noisette whirl, but one o f
them is the current single Sweets,
which is, well, sweet. One glaring
omission is She's A Rainbow,
which is criminal, as is the cover
artwork. About the music ? T h e
first track is like Electronic, and the
rest is like World Of Twist, which
isn't really like anything.
It's a real pick ' n ' mix selection,
really, a whole variety of dancey
chocolate flavours, a menagerie of
many musical delights. Happiness
is a zoo.
