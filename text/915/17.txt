Admission of Guilt
One o f the front page news stories
of Felix last week was entitled
'Super Plug'. There was not much
in the way of truth in it. I could bore
you with a f l a w l e s s m o r a l
justification of why it was done, but
I'll take pity. T h e picture was o f
Alec Baldwin, by the way, so in
addition to apologising to the
general populace for the joke,
whoever it was that phoned up the
Felix office insisting that the picture
was o f ' a famous Hollywood actor'
was right.
There was a factual inaccuracy in
the story called ' A D a y T o o L o n g '
on the back page. T h i s is covered
in response to a letter on the
following letters pages.
General Idiocy
W e appear to have a psychopath on
the loose in college. A n d for a
c h a n g e , i t ' s not w o r k i n g i n
Sherfield. Apparently there have
been three attempts to light the lift
shaft in Southside since term began.
Unfortunately I did not receive this
information until it was too late to
research it fully, though I know that
the fire in the lift at the east end o f
Southside last Saturday morning is
believed to be the one attempt that
was successful. A l s o , security
cleared an armchair from one o f the
main fire exits at that end o f the
building minutes before the fire
alarm went off.
Call me old-fashioned, but I take
personal offence when some person
or persons unknown try to murder
me and 400 others while we are
asleep. Setting light to a lift is an
incredibly effective way o f killing
as many people in a building as
possible in a short time and I hope
A n y o n e interested

the culprit is found and dealt with
severely, because they may decide
to attempt mass murder again.
It seems to have b e c o m e
acceptable amongst some members
of the student body to resort to
violence when they don't get their
way. This is not acceptable, and
when it o c c u r s under U n i o n
jurisdiction it should be made clear
that it is not acceptable by the
U n i o n . There is no excuse for
letting o f f a student for hitting
somebody because o f 'high jinx' or
inebriation - it is a criminal offence
and must be treated as such.
Far less seriously, but equally
criminal, many o f the new gold
lettering door signs in the U n i o n
building have already been stolen.
This is partly because the company
that put them up did not use security
screws, but mainly because many
students seem to have an odd 'open
season' attitude on other people's
property. Similarly, i f I find out
who stole the b o g roll from the
Felix office, their life will not be
worth living.
Sex Orgy in Concert Hall
There will be a U n i o n General
Meeting ( U G M ) next Thursday in
the U n i o n Concert Hall at 6.00pm.
Motions should be submitted to the
U n i o n office by 2.30pm next
Wednesday. This is your chance to
direct U n i o n events - by not
attending you are declaring that the
U n i o n is running superbly and
needs no changes. So i f you want
to no-confidence me or any other
sabbatical, get cracking. See Steve
Farrant's article on page 4.
Union Office Deadlines
This is positively the last time I
consider making space for any
articles coming in late from the
Union Office. T h e Felix office is
not exactly far from the U n i o n
Office, and merely telling me that
an article is on the way is not good
enough - 1 had to severely edit two
articles lor the U n i o n page to make
it all fit. Next time I shall burn the
article in front o f the sabbatical in
question. I know that they are busy,
but so am I and I don't see why I
should make exceptions for them.
I will mention no names but she
knows who she is. Rant over -1 feel
better now.
