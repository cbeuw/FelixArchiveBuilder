Flirting
This is John Duigon's second film
in a trilogy that began in 1987 with
The Year My Voice Broke, I didn't
see that but you won't be lost in this
movie, set in 1965 in fucking
kangaroo land. D o n n y E m b l i g
(Noha Taylor) is in form five at a
boy's boarding school. L i k e that
Dead Poets movie. However this is
no soppy propagandist A m e r i c a n
shite film, this movie is on a higher
plane.
Donny has a slight stutter and a
biggish nose—so he pretty well
qualifies as the butt o f pisstakes and
pranks. However, all those other
kids are so wrong, for Donny is the
coolest motherfucker in the world
(a bit unrealistically cool actually)
and intelligent too but obviously not
in the scientific sense. Across a
river, staring across at the boy's
school, is the girl's boarding
s c h o o l ; w e l l , it h a d to be
somewhere. A new girl, Thordive
Adjeua (Thordie Newton), the
daughter o f an African nationalist
a c a d e m i c w h o is a v i s i t i n g
professor. Being black, she suffers
some racism but makes a couple o f
good friends. A t a rugby match,
Donny meets Thordive. Well, y o u
know what, but that's only part o f
it. Although, this movie has no plot,
it doesn't need one; it's well
directed, produced and acted. F o r
a boarding school movie, I have to
rate this one very highly, I know
cinemas are now shit expensive, but
if you can, see it.

Holy Terror
This is a handily sized semi-
paperback which costs a bit too
much and doesn't last quite long
enough. It might have been better
the other way round.
Holy Terror is the second o f
D C s Elseworlds series, which
began with the interesting-idea-but-
below-par Gotham By Gaslight.
The intention is to place D C
characters in alternate histories and
see how they run. This one's about
Batman in a world where the
Puritans stayed in power after the
Revolution and society is pinned by
heresy, blasphemy and other words
that end in y. It's more or less an
origin story in disguise, and the plot
is fairly flimsy, most o f its attraction
coming from novelty value and
spot-the-cameo entertainment; the
art's nothing special and you could
say the same about the book. I'd
wait for Batman meets Bambi.

Other People's Money Hunting of the Snark
Danny DeVito is back and he's bad.
In a character cross between that o f
his role in Twins and War of the
Roses he plays a doughnut loving,
sex crazed, violin playing (?!!?),
money loving, lawyer hating,
doughnut loving, doughnut loving,
doughnut....honestly he can't get
enough o f them good o l ' dunkin'
doughnuts for breakfast, board
meeting, bedroom, ballroom (and
everywhere else that begins with a
'B'), he even sends flowers with the
bloody things. A n y w a y where was
I, oh yes, well basically he's a Wall
Street cowboy, rude, crude yet
undeniably brilliant, rescuing dying
companies and carting them off to
slaughter. A l l for enormous profit,
but mainly for fun.
The film centres around his sights
on snapping up a debt free, 81 year
old N e w England W i r e & Cable
C o m p a n y . F o r ' L a r r y the
Liquidator'. It's the perfect target,
piece o f cake (or should that be
doughnut?), but this is one he's
going to have to fight for.
I had very mixed feelings about
this movie, as did most who saw it.
It starts like a second rate slot on
an Imperial College comedy night,
with Danny boy coming out with so
many one-liners, bloody corny ones
too, that the film looks desperate for
laughs. I ' m glad to say, however,
that it does improve immensely in
the middle with the ending being
both completely unpredictable (I
mean, how did they come up with
air cushions?) and very original.
There's a hell o f a lot crammed
into this film, with love rearing its
ugly head, soppy, tear jerking bits
aplenty, laughs by the lorry full,
and an excellent supporting cast,
namely Gregory Peck, Penelope
A n n M i l l e r , Piper Laurie and D e a
Jones. It's worth seeing, but not
worth wetting yourself over. This
must be Danny at his finest. It opens
at the Cannon, Shaftesbury Avenue
on 15th November. B e there o r be
a doughnut.

Ever since Lewis Carroll put pen to
paper and wrote The Hunting of the
Snark and then refused to explain
what it meant, if anything, it has
remained one o f the greatest
'nonsense' writings. M i k e Batt's
dramatisation o f the poem is as
great a piece of theatre as the poem
was o f writing. T h e story concerns
an eclectic group of" 19th century
stereotypes sailing away to find a
Snark. Through brilliant songs and
aweinspiring stage effects the
travellers tell o f their reasons for
going and hopes. David M c C a l l u m
(Steel, Invisible Man) as the
narrator, Lewis Carroll, and Kenny
Everett as the Billiard Marker head
an extremely competent cast. If, as
the show tells, each gets what they
deserve then this show should run
and run.
