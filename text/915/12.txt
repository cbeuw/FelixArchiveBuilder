Boyz 'n' The Hood Mannequin on the Move
Boyz 'n * the Hood is the debut fdm
written and directed by 23 year-old
director John Singleton. Born and
raised in the South Central Los
Angeles ghettos, this also provides
the subject matter for the movie.
The film is based upon the coming
of age of three boys subjected to the
drugs and violence that comes with
the territory, and the friendship that
develops between them. T h e three
boys are played by e x - N W A rapper
Ice Cube. M o r r i s Chestnut, and
Cuba Golding Jr as Tre, with Larry
Fishbourne, of Spike Lee's School
Daze fame, as T r e ' s father.
This film is not an action movie
about rival crack warlords staging
gangster shoot-outs in C o m p t o n
alleys, nor is it a depressing three
hour arty epic about life in the
American slums. T h e film is,
moreover, funny, real, entertaining
and thought p r o v o k i n g . John
Singleton demonstrates how racism
works in Western society and
provides some of the means and the
hope to escape from the situation.
O n the advertisements for this
film you might see the slogan
'Increase the Peace'; this is the real
message intended.
Cutting through the bullshit this
is quite possibly the best film you
could see this year. But don't take
my word for it; beg, borrow or steal
the money to get a ticket and see this
film. Splendid.
Bob.
Although seriously lacking in every
department, not least credibility,
with minimal characterisation and
a plot of such mawkish and
saccharine sentimentality that even
Snow White w o u l d b l a n c h e ,
Mannequin on the Move was not
entirely without hope.
Redemption came from some
delightfully choreographed scenes
reminiscent of the M a r x Brothers at
their best. The producers made a
conscious decision to use unknowns
in the lead parts and whilst this may
be commendable their rough edges
rendered a very amateur finish to
the film.
W h i l s t d e v o i d o f b l o o d ,
gratuitous violence and virtually
everything that makes films like
Terminator the hits they are, this
film will appeal to the hopelessly
moonstruck amongst you and good
luck to you, and it. Y o u ' l l need it.

The Reviews Editors wish to point

This film received one and a half
lines in the Sunday Times. Barry
Norman ignored it. Draw your
own conclusions.
Earl's Court Motorfair Street Asylum
Cars! Cars! Cars! Is that all there
is ?
In fact, yes, that is all there is
(apart from a bit about the B B C ,
some in- car stereo displays and
L y n n F a u l d s - W o o d f r o m
Watchdog) and that's what makes
the Motorfair such a bizarre idea.
Granted, a car's the second biggest
purchase most people will ever
make, but even so, it was quite
terrifying to see the excess of
(expensive) shiny metal and the
incredibly sad visitors mingling in
autoerotic fantasy. A n average
stand costs half a million pounds,
which is probably why B M W chose
not to attend this year; they
probably felt it wasn't worth having
greasy boy racers and sandalled
Enthusiasts clamber over their
i m m a c u l a t e l y s h i n e d
vroom-vrooms.
So what is there to say? After the
first few hundred cars they all start
to look rather similar (probably
because they do anyway) and
attention wanders irrevocably to the
displays. V o l v o had an upended
crash-car; Peugeot chose to flog
their wares with some hideous
M O R shite and drove me to the
Reliant Robins, where a shiny blue
three-wheeler tried, against the odds
and the competition, to look like a
superlative willy-substitute. N o
leggy blondes (except L y n n Faulds-
W o o d , of course) this year;
presumably they're reserved for
photocalls. A l l around there were
sad people having the greatest
moment of their lives as they
photographed each other sitting in
Mercs; as they encountered the
excitement of Renault and drooled
appreciatively at cars groin-high,
twenty feet long and with bulbous
heads (hmm.. so what do you think,
D r . Freud ?). A s for green issues,
forget 'em; all you get is (yesss)
V o l v o and the Royal College of
Art.
The show's not very interesting,
the cars are O K , most of the people
are crap.
The Flying Gerbil
A i m e d straight at the heart of the
Dirty Harry exploitation market this
film is remarkable in the fact it isn't
crap. It is poor but it isn't crap. Not
very crap anyway.
Wings Hauser as the good cop
who joins the elite Special Squad
who crack down on crime H A R D ! !
This squad consists of people who
look like the bad guy extras in the
A - T e a m or M a c G y v e r and who
polish guns and spit and swear like
wot real men do. Out on patrol the
sensitive Wings notices his partner
seems to be on the verge of
homicidal psychosis, twitching and
sweating like a guinea pig in a
microwave, when the guy appears
to have E S P and they bust an
innocent looking apartment finding
a rapist and blowing the mother
away. Unfortunately an innocent
gardener also gets killed and that
night the partner 'commits suicide'.
T w o points of interest!! E S P and
mysterious suicide!! Not only is
Wings disturbed by the actions of
the others but also by his own
increasing violence and awareness.
Being a true genre video there are
a few gratuitous scenes of black
leather female domination (whips
and chains), unnecessary deaths,
guns and knives appearing regularly
and the reasons behind the mystery
coming directly from 1950's Sci-Fi.
A l l this said, there is a rather
disturbing right wing message
coming through this film. Granted,
the story is about a man against the
scheme, but the message that the
only way to fight the increasing
crime is by extreme force is rather
frightening. The opening scenes
show a vide-cam view from a car
of a street and all the acts of violent
crime that they pass; murder,
robbery, bag snatching, fighting,
drug selling etc.
This film is the kind that is on
T . V . late at night and is a bit too
interesting to turn off. Get a few
cans in and sit and enjoy (if the
video shop has nothing better).
