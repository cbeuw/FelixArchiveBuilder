In the coming 12 months the far most important issues f o r students at IC w i l l be
union autonomy, graduate employment, the environment nd r e p r e s e n t a t i o n . Thesese are
a l l important t o students i n IC and are issues through which students can involve
thsmselvesin the world outside c o l l e g e , because of the folowing l i n k s .
The r e s u l t of the present attacks on our union would t o break up the body i n which we
can work wuthin s o c i e t y . The unemployment w i l l d i r e c t l y affect a l l of us i n a short t i m e .
The environment affects a l l people whax a l i k e but scoonce stuents have s p e c i a l r e s -
p o n s i b i l i t y . Representation at decision-making l e v e l nould mena that students and
s o c i e t y together shape the future of u n i v e r s i t i e s . At the present SU's only have
vauge r i g h t s , these must be stated c l e a r l y and no these there can be no compromise.

groups wuch as c h a r i t i e s whos p o l i t i c a l v o i c e i s stopped by f i n a n c i a l s t r i n g s .
Many graduates l a s t year d i d not get jobs because of the governments p o l i c y of mass
unemployment. This i s due t o weak B r i t i s h p r o f i t s and the overseas competiion. S t u -
dents now must affirm the r i g h t of a l l t o a decent l i v i n g and work w i t h these t r y i n g
t o acheive t h i s . This means working w i t h trade unions i n t h e i r f i g h t t o c o n t r o l
redundancy, t o help b u i l d claimants unions (unions organising the unemployed) and
through HUB f i g h t i n g at a n a t i o n a l l e v e l .
The many people who do r e a l i s e the problems that man i s c r e a t i n g f o r himself i n the
environment have two main obstacles - a l a c k of knowledge and an a t t i t u d e of p r o f i t s
before people-. To remove these, thes system of p r o f i t s must be replaced and and
education work done, t o i v e s c i e n t i s t s a greater say i n the d i r e c t i o n of research.
To provide t r u e r e p r e s e n t a t i o n , a long rem perspective of d e c i s i o n taken by students,
academics, c o l l e g e a u t h o r i t i e s and s o c i e t y i s needed. To work towards t h i s and xbesk
remove dissil&usionment the system can be made more e f f e c t i v e . The importance of rep'
resentstiori at department l e v e l must be increased, union meetings should make demands
t o the board of governers, representatives should be e l e c t e d at union meetings and
then report back t o them.
"17IJ.Y I 17ANT TO BE HON. S E C . " by Brenda D i l l e y .
I want t o do the job because during the three years I have been at c o l l e g e I have
"been involved i n a v i a i range of c o l l e g e a f f a i r s and union a c t i v i t i e s and have con-
s t a n t l y been made aware of the f a u l t s and f a i l i n g of the c o l l g e ana the union. I f e e l
I have a good a p p r e c i a t i o n of the d i f f i c u l t i e s f a c i n g IC students and I have a true
desire to f i n d s o l u t i o n s .
Over the past two or three years the union has made great progress i n a few areas
*~e now have some representation on c o l l e g e committees and some influence i n academic a f
a f f a i r s , and we must continue pressing f o r more. Three are however many facets o f the
c o l l e g e and the l i f e o f a student at IC t h a t are s t i l l VERY bad. I t i s there things
that I am p a r t i c u l a r l y concerned about. We must develop a p o s i t i v e approach t o the
problems of involvement and communication and t r y t o f i n d a means by which the union
has something to fiffer t o a l l students and i s not just run by the "few".
The job of Hon. Sec. MUST "involve c o n s i d e r a t i o n of a l l these p o i n t s . I am t r u l y
i n t e r e s t e d i n them and I b e l i e v e I am capable of c o n t r i b u t i n g t o t h e i r s o l u t i o n .
Please come t o the h a s t i n g and/or read my manifesto t o f i n d out how I intend t o
t a c k l e these problems.
