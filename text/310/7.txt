Ist XI Reach Final
The I.C. team must have
been considered to be the
under-dogs of this U . L U .
Cup semi-final, with Gold-
smiths fielding five U.L.U.
players, but their thought-
ful preparation which had
taken place off the field
was well rewarded.
The opening minutes of
the game were true to cup
tie tradition with both
teams trying to establish
their superiority. Play was
fast and possession was
keenly contested with the
sides evenly matched.
However, it was Gold-
smiths who eventually took
the lead, when the ball
was hammered across the
I.C. goalmouth. P. Worth-
ington stopped it but as he
stretched to clear he sli-
ced the ball into his own
net. This seemed to kindle
the extra determination
which was required from
the I.C. team and from
this point onward they
didn't look back. Their de-
termination began to bring
the just rewards as they
began to pressurise the
Goldsmiths defence and
after three very near mis-
ses in scrambles around
the Goldsmith's goal-
mouth Ian Rodgers even-
tually put the ball into the
net to make the half time
score 1—1.
In the second half I.C.
began to play with much
more confidence, the ball
was played swiftly and pla-
yers were beginning to
find space up front whilst
at the back P. Worthing-
ton, S. Wells, M. Pearson
and P. Maslin seemed to
have the Goldsmiths attack
well under control. The
sheer determination of B.
Smith, B. Milne and I.
Rodgers up front was re-
warded when B. Milne put
I.C. ahead and soon after-
wards the same player
made the score 3—1. How-
ever, Goldsmiths had by
no means conceded defeat
and but for some very
courageous goalkeeping
from M. Whitham they
might have pulled a goal
back. P. Bartlett substitu-
ted J . Kelly in midfield and
this seemed to steady the
I.C. team, who had lost C.
Willcock, their captain, af-
ter an incident in the Gold-
smiths penalty area. How-
ever, to clinch what must
be regarded as a great vic-
tory, I.C. scored twice
more before the final
whistle. N. Fryer made no
mistake from the penalty
spot and B. Smith steered
a great through ball, which
had caught the Goldsmiths
defence flat-footed, past
the groping goalkeeper.
This victory now puts
I.C. into the final at Mot-
spur Park on March 11th
when they meet Q.E.C.
On the same date the
I.C. 2nd XI meet Gold-
smiths II and will be keen
to retain the Reserve Cup
and complete the double
of cup and league once
again.
HYDE PARK RELAY
Saturday, 19th Febru-
ary saw a multitude of run-
ners from various parts of
the globe converge on the
Union building. The rea-
son was the cross country
clubs big event of the
year: the Annual Invita-
tion Hyde Park Road Re-
lay.
Entries this year were
well over the 90 team mark
and with six runners in
each team (each running
one lap of the 2 mile 1740
yard course) that meant
there were over six hun-
dred people present, when
the markers, officials, hel-
pers and supporters had
been included.
With 10 minutes to go
to the start, at 3.00 p.m.,
the 80 runners for the first
leg were ready waiting at
the start, pushing and
shoving to get a good posi-
tion. With 4 minutes to go,
the race was started as
the pushing at the start
was getting violent.
On the command of get
set go 80 athletes shot off
down Rotten Row at break
neck pace; the organisers
bore no responsibility for
prams, horses, dogs, old
ladies etc. in the way.
With a mile gone Bir-
mingham University took
the lead which they were
JP
never to lose, through
Andy Holden. He finished
this lap in a remarkable
time of 13 mins. 53 sees.
At the change-over Bir-
mingham had a lead of 6
seconds over P. Varney of
York University. I.C.'s first
leg runner Rob Parker
came in 31st with a time
of 14.56, the best time in
the race by an I.C. run-
ner.
Throughout the race Bir-
mingham built up their
lead and finished in a re-
cord time of 84 mins. 19
sees., 1 min. 20 sees,
ahead of the second team
and breaking the record
that they set up last year
by 35 seconds. Leeds
University finished second
with a time of 85.39 and
Sheffield University fin-
ished third with 86.17. I.C.
finished first among the
London Colleges, one
place ahead of University
College, but 34th in the
whole field with a time of
94.22.
Despite Birmingham's
record breaking run they
did not run the fastest lap.
This went to John King
from Alsager Training Col-
lege with a time of 13
mins. 39 sees. However, 4
of their runners came with-
in the fastest 10 laps and
their slowest runner did a
time of 14.19.
After the race, a tea of
sandwiches and cakes was
ravenously consumed by
all while awaiting the
results. At 5.30, dead on
time, they were ready and
Mrs. H. Jones, the Pro-Rec-
tor's wife presented the
cups and medals. Medals
went to the 1st 3 teams and
to the runner of the fastest
lap. The Lady Roderic Hill
Cup went, for the second
year running to Birming-
ham University although it
was not actually presen-
ted to them, as they had
the cheek to leave it at
home (perhaps in anticipa-
tion). The Imperial College
Union Cup went, for the
nth year running to Bor-
ough Road College, the
first team in with under 500
men in their college. They
came 4th in the overall
field.
I would like to express
my thanks to Mrs. H. Jones
for presenting the prizes,
the officials who kindly
gave up their time to help
and to numerous members
of the Cross Country Club
and Imperial College,
whose help was greatly ap-
preciated and without
which the whole thing
would not have been pos-
sible.
Cricket
The season that you
have all been waiting for
is almost upon us, and I
trust that you are going to
play for the College at cric-
ket. The College runs at
least 3 teams and so caters
for all types of ability
(even yours!). We are
holding trials on the first
Wednesday of next term
(26th April), and if you
wish to come, sign on the
Cricket notice board in
the Union. I hope to see
you during the season.
Rugby
On Wednesday, 23rd
February, I.C. 1st XV play-
ed King's College in the
semi-final of the Gutter-
idge Cup and emerged vic-
torious by 20 points to 4.
I.C. won the toss and elec-
ted to play into a stiff (?)
breeze in the first half. The
referee was of "I know
you Powell" fame and
was soon awarding num-
erous penalties to I.C. as
King's did not know about
his eccentricities. This en-
abled I.C. to take the lead
from a James penalty.
King's however came back
into the game when from
a loose ruck near the I.C.
posts, the ball was sent
out to the winger who
scored in the corner —
the conversion failed. This
score seemed to spur on
I.C. to greater heights and
the King's full back was
caught in possession un-
der his own posts. He
failed to release the ball
and so James kicked an
easy penalty to put I.C.
back in the lead 6—4. I.C.
managed to hold out and
turned round confident
with the wind now behind
them. King's task was
made more difficult as
they had lost a centre in
the first half with a finger
injury.
A long kick-off pushed
King's back into their own
25 and here they were to
remain, except for brief
breakaway attacks, for the
game. Whenever they
managed to get into the
I.C. half they were driven
back with long wind-assis-
ted kicks by the I.C. de-
fence. Being pinned in
their own 25 it is under-
standable that all the pen-
alties awarded to I.C. were
from kickable positions.
However, true to form,
Tebbett only got one but
made amends by getting a
dropped goal as well. 12—
3 up, I.C. now began to
throw the ball about.
Kings' supporters began to
point out that I.C. had not
yet scored a try and so to
prove how "easy" it was to
score we let Roy Matthews
trundle over. This try came
EDITORIAL
For those not in the Union bar on Wednesday,
February 23rd, the Rugby 1st XV won their semi-final
against Kings 20—4 and the Football 1st XI hammered
Goldsmiths 5—1 also to reach the final.
This is a great chance for I.C. to go down to Motspur
Park and support these two teams on their respective
Saturdays. The Rugby played L S E , a side they had
previously beaten, last Saturday, 4th March so the
result should be known — see Felicity. The teams were
rumoured to be training hard before the match at their
seaside hideaway near Balham, but they should be in
a relaxed state of mind after visiting the movies on
the Friday evening.
If you missed last Saturday, then you have another
chance this week, Saturday 11th March when both the
1st XI and 2nd XI play at Motspur against Q.E.C. and
Goldsmiths 2nd's. The 2nd's play in the morning and
must be favourites but the 1st's have lost and won
games with Q.E.C. Q.E.C. are a small College but I
expect them to be supporting their team in force so we
can show up our neighbours by filling the FREE
coaches which will be leaving the Union.
The Football Club, living on a shoestring budget,
have been unable to go pre-match training to Lilleshall
but are nevertheless confident.
Next term, I.C. has a few unimportant academic tests
but there are excellent facilities for cricket and tennis
to be used. The new captain of tennis is Pete Dunning,
Falmouth 141 and he would welcome anyone interested
in playing, to contact him.

A scene from the Gutteridge Cup Final which I.C. won
(see FELICITY).
from a ruck won by Ken
(get the beer in) Horse-
man who fed Bill Baines
in the centre. Baines gave
Jim Hunt room in which
to move and he in turn
drew the full back before
feeding inside to Roy Mat-
thews who flopped over.
Kings' were now demor-
alised and I.C. scored an-
other try through Jim Hunt.
Neither of these tries were
converted, needless to
say. I.C. might have had
another try but the I.C.
linesman Kitty Marriott de-
cided to be honest and
tell the ref that the ball
had gone into touch —
and so the score stood at
20 points to 4 until the
final whistle.
Many thanks to our
numerous supporters —
your vocal help was much
appreciated.

Boat Club regain Dixon Bowl
Imperial College 1st VIM
won the open division of
the University of London
Head of the River to re-
gain the Dixon Bowl. The
race held on the Tideway
over the 'reversed boat
race' course was a gruel-
ling affair, due to a gusty
wind and an ebbing tide.
The water was very choppy
down to Hammersmith,
and the wash from a tug
coming upstream caused
consternation to a few
coxes.
The start was staggered
with I.C. going off second,
they passed Guys Hospital
and on the final timing
won by a comfortable mar-
gin of \ minute, over St.
Thomas Hospital. Tyrian
(U.L II) had the fastest
time but were not eligible
for the open division. I.C.
II in spite of some jostling
by their cox, had a disap-
pointing row, and dropped
a couple of positions.
In the Senior C (Junior)
division I.C. Ill were bea-
ten into second place by
U.C. & H. who came up
from the back of the field
to finish in 5th position
overall and win the Senior
C medal.
The most encouraging
results of the afternoon
were in the Novice division
in which the 5th and 6th
VIM's came 1st and 2nd
respectively with just 5
seconds between them.
The crews put up a really
good show and complet-
ely outclassed the rest of
the Novice entry. These
crews which will form the
basis of the club in fu-
ture seasons have shown
keenness and rivalry, the
result of the dedication of
their respective coaches.
