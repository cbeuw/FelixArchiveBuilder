"JUMPERS" — Michael Hordern and Diana Rigg in an
arrowing tale.
Even now I cannot really make up my mind about
Tony Richardson's new production of 'The Three-
penny Opera' (Prince of Wales). Bertholt Brecht used
the main story of John Gay's eighteenth century 'The
Beggar's Opera' as the basis for this politically orien-
tated Ballad Opera, and despite the length of time
since writing (1928 or so) much of the flavour of
Brecht's convictions still comes through strongly.
Blind Capitalism is much the same in Seventies Brit-
ain as in Twenties Berlin.
There is a great deal that is
very effective in this production,
Kurt Weill wrote the original
music that consists largely of
sleazily dreamy melodies in the
Jazz style of the Twenties (the
play is set in Soho in about
1925), and the tunes are finely
evocative. The set consists
largely of a macabre Merry-Go-
Round in a loosely defined junk-
yard environment—corrugated
iron proliferates. And the whole
tone is downbeat as we are led
through the Brechtian Under-
world. Joe Melia is very good
as the gangster Macheath ("All
Macheath has/Is his flick-knife/
And he keeps it/out of sight")
and Vanessa Redgrave is enter-
taining as his Polly Peachum.
The best singing comes from an
extraordinary menacing Annie
Ross as the Whore Jenny—in
fact all the acting is first class.
But, I am sorry to say, there
is, inherently, a certain coher-
ence lacking in the show. We
are rather used to Musicals in
which the songs-arise out of the
action as smoothly as possible,
but here the ballads are kept
distinctly separate as the actors
come downstage, sing their
song, and the broken action is
resumed. The production is, as I
PLAYS
have said, good, but in such a
variety of ways that it makes
the whole business very 'bitty'.
The 'ensemble' feeling is not
there.
But given the original mater-
ial I do not really see how this
production could have been im-
proved upon, and the standard
social points come across well.
Most impressive of all was Lon
Satton's sinister Narrator snarl-
ing his way through "The Ballad
of Mack the Knife" with the clos-
ing, poignant words "You can
spot those/In the limelight/
Those in darkness/You don't
see".
I could not get to "The Bal-
cony" (Royal Shakespeare Com-
pany, Aldwych), so I sent An-
other. From what I have gather-
ed from him, the play (by Jean
Genet) is very bizarre (some-
thing about illusions being
worked out in a brothel!), and
the excellent acting creates a
powerful atmosphere. My sister
did not like it—so it sounds
very much a matter of taste.
Have fun folks.

MUSIC
THE S T R A W B S " G R A V E NEW W O R L D " (A & M)
The concepts of "Folk-Rock" and "Electric Folk"
have been bandied about so much in the last couple
of years (every time a reviewer got his hands on an
album by Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span or the
Strawbs) that this sort of music has come to be accept-
ed as a form of music in itself, like folk or rock. But
electronic folk? Very freaky. A bit like kippers and
custard, quite acceptable separately (if you've got
nothing else) but not together, etc., etc.
On this album Dave
Cousins and co. prove
otherwise. Their electron-
ics don't have the brute " " " ^ • " • " • " ^
force of the Soft Machine down to the ground, es-
or the spacey quality of the pecially as his replacement
Pink Floyd but they will Blue Weaver is playing the
doubtless surprise you all same instruments Wake-
the same. Apart from being man now uses with Yes.
the best album the Strawbs Although his roots are in
have made, "Grave New folk Dave Cousins can
World" shows that " n i c e " blow a mean electric gui-
Olde Worlde lyrics sound tar (on "Tomorrow") and
good when played over a at other times they can
reverse tape backing or play in an Indianesque
any other musical backing (what a ghastly word — I
for that matter. I wonder just thought it up) style
why it was that Rick Wake- with sitar and tablas, or
man left the group. He with a string arrangement
hated folk, he said, but so provided by the mellotron
many styles are incorpor- or even with a brass band
ated here I think the music (The Robert Kirby Silver
would have suited him Band and Tony Visconti's
Old Tyme Dance Orches-
tra) or with just acoustic
guitar accompaniment —
songs on which the
Strawbs built their reputa-
tion.
That's the music then,
and now for the words.
This is yet another concept
album and the title track is
a rather despairing protest
song, very depressing,
with Dave Cousins grunt-
ing "May you rot in your
grave New World' (clever
pun, what) as if with his
dying breath. Not all the
songs are so morbid but I
think the general idea is
that things now aren't what
they used to be and God
knows what they'll be like
in the Future. It also seems
to represent a journey, as
the first line of the first
song, "Benedictus" is "The
traveller has far to g o " and
the last track is called
"The Journey's E n d " .
"Benedictus" could be a
song for progressive
churches to adopt to at-
tract the younger genera-
tion; the tune reminds me
of a hymn but as I haven't
been to church for a while
I couldn't say which one.
"Ah Me Ah My" features
Tony Hooper on vocals,
backed by Tony Visconti's
O.T.D.O. and I can imagine
Maurice Chevalier doing
this one. "I'd like to live on
a farm again like I did for
part of the war/I've got a
few happy memories
though we were rather
poor". Mon Dieu!
Some people may dis-
miss this album, with its
heavy religious overtones,
as the most pretentious
rubbish since " Jesus
Christ Superstar" (see
J E R U S A L E M ) but I don't.
My only regrets are that I
missed the Strawbs' recent
tour—these numbers must
sound great when per-
formed live — and also
that I am only borrowing
this record because I
couldn't get it off the
record company. The al-
bum, by the way, comes in
a nifty thrice-folding pack-
age and the booklet with
the lyrics is illustrated with
a medieval art form which
I can't name but which I
rather like.
Will there be room in the
New World for The
Strawbs? I hope so.
F I L M S
In the beginning there was the 'Jazz Singer', films
had found a voice and the first thing they did was to
sing. Singing and music has been featured in many
hundreds of films since then.
Then came rock 'n' roll and
we saw the gyrations of 'Elvis'
in 'Love Me Tender' (1956) a
very old story with songs, this
was the first in a long string of
very, very trite films (the not-
able exception being the in-
telligent 'Change of Habit',
never released over here but
shown on television last sum-
mer). There were other so-
called 'pop' films featuring many
artists and groups which were
just show cases to promote their
latest LP (the only exception
being the Beatles' films which
were much more different from
the standard pop film). The
mid-sixties saw the vogue for
cinema-verite. The first films
were 'A Hard Day's Night' (al-
though there was a large
amount of fiction involved in
the film) and Pennebaker's
'Don't Look Back'—a factual
documentary of Dylan's tour of
Britain in 1965 which was very
good and very perceptive. Pen-
nebaker was also responsible
for the first 'Pop Festival' film
with 'Monterey Pop' which, I
understand, is the best of the
Festival films—more than that I
can't say, but Michael Wad-
leigh's 'Woodstock' is the festi-
val film that everyone has heard
of—an easily likeable film; the
sheer grandeur of seeing the
200, 300, 400 or 500 thousand
in the audience is certainly awe-
inspiring—I tend to get the
same feeling when seeing any
film with 'a cast of thousands',
but I also tend to get the feeling
of isolation—I want to know
what the people in the middle
of it all think about the situa-
tion, there was no point of iden-
tification in the film—there was
no one person or group of per-
sons with whom I could identify
—but 'Gimme Shelter', this was
the best of the bunch. I hope
that some enterprising cinema
owner runs 'Gimme Shelter'
and 'Woodstock' in one pro-
gramme. In 'Gimme Shelter' we
see the reaction of one group
(i.e. the Hell's Angels) to a
'Woodstock' type situation (i.e.
free concert, large gathering,
aggressive music) and the re-
sult is very, very terrifying.
The next film is the latest in
the genre and to me perhaps
one of the worst of the films,
I've been looking at. 'JIMi
PLAYS BERKELEY' is shoddy.
It neither makes any point nor
says anything, other than Hen-
drix was a great musician and
I doubt whether many people
would disagree with that. The
film is a rip-off, a deliberate at-
tempt to cash in on Hendrix's
death. The film lacks any artistic
merits, being a very average
film of one of his concerts with
some stock footage of riots in
Berkeley. The music played was
good and this version of 'The
Star-Spangled Banner' was bet-
ter than that in 'Woodstock',
mainly because it had a very
good close-up of him playing it
(in fact the camerawork was
very static). But overall it lacked
taste and I doubt whether Hen-
drix himself would have allowed
the film to be released if he
were alive.
