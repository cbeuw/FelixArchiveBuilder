Today you have the op-
portunity to question the
proposed candidates for
the three main Union
Posts, i.e. President, Dep-
uty President and the Sec-
retary. Felix gives you the
chance to read what they
have to say.
As far as can be ascer-
tained, three are standing
for President, these being
Chris Sheppard, Bill Ger-
rard and . . .
Chris Sheppard is a
relative newcomer to the
game of high-power poli-
tics. Although he has been
on Council as Civil Engin-
eering Departmental Rep.,
he has avoided any con-
troversial issues until re-
cently.
Bill Gerrard is probably
better known since he is
President of R C S but this
by no means makes him
the obvious choice. Quite
often it is the people in
the background who wield
most influence. As far as
we know . . . is also think-
ing of standing and we
apologise for not includ-
ing his manifesto.
However, the first two
have produced manifestos
for publication. It must be
said, though, that a 400
word limit was imposed
which resulted in Chris
Sheppard's article being
cut — from an original
called
" A N INDIVIDUAL
PERSPECTIVE"
W. Gerrard
In choosing the president
for the coming year, I believe
one should not pick someone
with too fixed a point of view,
and who will, therefore, bend to
the will of the Union (not as has
happened in the past). He must
have a large knowledge of the
relevant facts so that each mem-
ber of the Union may make up
his own mind on a subject. In
order for this to happen, he must
have a good understanding of
how to run a Union meeting, and
the relevant standing orders.
Further, he must have the I.C.
students at heart before any
social or political commitments.
Although the above may seem
difficult to carry out, I hope to
fulfil the role of president with
that basis. As R.C.S. President
for the past year, I have learnt
a lot about running a Union, and
also a great deal of information
about the various committees of
I.C. Union.
Several items I foresee as im-
portant in the coming year are:
1) Information—too few stud-
ents understand fully what Aca-
demic affairs, Welfare etc.,
really do—hence no one cares.
I would encourage all commit-
tees to issue information, not
lengthy, but containing informa-
tion in such a form that a Fresh-
er could understand it.
2) Continue our struggle for
better accommodation—starting
on the long overdue new halls
of residence; a university-finan-
ced local lodgings bureau, etc.
3) Co-ordination between
I.C.U. and the C.C.U's. to pro-
vide not only an effective 'poli-
tical side", but also a better
social side.
I hope that this will encour-
age everyone to take an interest
in I.C.U. elections, and especi-
ally in
Yours truly,

The many inadequacies of
pre-university education provide
us with a predictable stereo-
type Imperial College Fresher.
None of us is him, but all of
us know him. He has had no
reason to question the nature
of direction of his education,
and one who has been subject-
ed to an academically biased
and intellectually very narrow
course of education since the
age of fifteen. Yet within the
confines of the college and its
already narrow influence the in-
dividual is still further isolated
from any diversity of stimuli, in-
tellectual or otherwise.
The college fails to either rec-
ognise or accept its responsibi-
ties to its students as individ-
uals. The college insists that
placing the burden on the indi-
vidual is all part of the 'chal-
lenge' of university life, vital in
a process of character building
and essential in producing the
sort of good moral fibre that in-
dustry demands. It assumes that
secondary education has been
successful in producing an an-
nual supply of 800 well-balanced
individuals. That is the only sort
of student that IC really caters
for. It must be shown otherwise.
Any individual has the right to
an education that caters for his
needs as a person, and not just
the needs of external industry
and governmental interests.
And so how does the Union
fit into this iniquitous picture?
How can it play a valuable role
when in the eyes of many a
cynic it is regarded merely as
a playground for extreme politi-
cal activists and a handful of
others who like the sound of
their own voices (sic). The first
step is to remove that image
and then by a process of re-
structuring and clearly defining
its role, develop an entirely new
approach to its relationship both
to the college and to its mem-
bers. The Union should be seen
to be primarily concerned with
the interests of its members (in
every sense of the word), with
going some way towards offer-
ing that which the college does
not. It must take the initiative
to work for a better community
than that which exists at pres-
ent. Or in one sentence, the
creation of a real educational
COMMUNITY.
As late as last Sunday
there was no opposition to
Mike Griffiths as Deputy
President. It is as well that
such an important post
will be contested and not
go the way of many minor
places in the Union. Too
often, people get elected
unopposed. This can bene-
fit no-one, the students feel
left-out (even though it's
their fault!) and the candi-
date is never forced to
think out his policies in
any great detail.
Admittedly, the post of
Deputy President lacks the
glamour of the other two
and all credit goes to Mike
Griffiths for standing first.
However, Paul Jowitt is
planning on standing as
well and s o : —
Mike Griffiths
The Deputy President has an
uncertain position in I.C. Union.
Officially he is number 2 in the
Union; in fact the Hon. Secre-
tary and President are the two
sabbatical officers, so he tends
to be number 3 for most practi-
cal purposes. Besides being in
this general position of respon-
sibility he has certain specific
commitments: he is in charge of
the Union building and discipline
in the bars. By tradition he is re-
sponsible for almost anything
domestic, such as the Union's
dealings with the refectories.
By the end of this year I will
have been the academic affairs
officer of the RCS Union for
nearly two years. It is not a
glamorous post, so you may
never have heard of it or me.
However it is not a trivial job,
and in fact it puts me automati-
cally on thirteen committees
from the college Board of Stud-
ies to the RCSU General Com-
mittee. One of these committees
is ICU Council, the body that
effectively runs your Union. Over
the last two years I have taken
plenty of opportunities, both on
these committees and outside
them, to see what goes on and
participate in it.
I think I have the experience
and ability to do the job of Dep-
uty President. At the time of
writing my nomination is not
contested. If it is, I hope you
will vote tor me—// you're not
convinced, come to the hustings
today to ask questions. Whether
I'm opposed or not, if I get in I
hope I can justify your vote.
Will you give me the chance?
Paul Jowitt
Deputy President:— ...
Q1. What does he do?
Q2: What ought he to do?
Q3: What did he do?
Q4: What should he do?
05; What will he do?
A1: Debatable.
A2: Debatable.
A3: Questionable.
A4: Arguable.
A5: You tell me, that's the
general idea.
You see, the job has never
been defined. The D.P. usually
has to deal with Union disci-
pline, the refectory committee,
the bar committee, security and
maintenance of the Union Build-
ings, etc.
I know enough about the job
to know that I can do it, I know
enough about it, to want to do
it. I don't know too much about
it to be straitjacketed complete-
ly by it and resistant to change.
To most people the Union
must improve its facilities, its
ideals and its involvement. It
constantly needs new ideas. Its
fairly easy to just keep the
Union with its head above water,
but that would leave it as a
stereotyped soft-boiled egg, de-
void of any activity of new
concepts.
As far as I am concerned,
the Unions' own discipline pro-
cedures are totally inadequate
and archaic. Compared to the
Union/College discipline proce-
dures, they tend to resemble the
Spanish Inquisition.
Looking at other Universities/
Colleges of comparable size and
Union Fee incomes, the Union
Building and its facilities are
abysmal. I have some ideas in
mind for the Lower Lounge; they
need some feedback to see if
you like them, and checking
out to see if they are practical.
There are more loosely de-
fined roles the D.P. can play.\
There is mixed thought whether
or not he should involve him-
self in the policy forming, policy
implementing of the Union. I
believe he should be involved.
To cut himself off from NUS,
Community Action, Academic
Affairs, etc. is just like burying
his head in the sand. It's ironical
that the Union is always cajoling
people to get involved, and
when they do, to shut them up
and send them away to be a
good boy.
So there it is, I don't know
all the answers, but I am recep-
tive to ideas. So between us, I
think we can go places, I hope
so.
And now we come to
what many people con-
sider the most difficult job
of all, that of Honorary
Secretary. To date, only
two people are seriously
considering the post; Mairi
Waddington and Martin C.
Black (Secretary of R C S
and Floor Rep).
Both have produced
documents.
M. C. Black
/ am standing for the position
of Hon. Secretary of Imperial
College Union because I know
that I am capable of doing the
job and doing it well.
I am not going to publish long
manifestos full of promises be-
cause, rather than having poli-
cies of his own, it is the duty
of the Hon. Secretary to be the
servant of the Union and he
exists to carry out the wishes
of the Union Meeting as well as
organising the efficient adminis-
tration of the Union.
I see my role as an adminis-
trator of Union Affairs. Through
my experience of various Col-
lege Committees and therefore
my knowledge of procedure and
College Administrative staff, I
see myself as a strong link be-
tween the Union and the Col-
lege.
i
/ have some ideas for sorting
out the bureaucratic tangle
which exists in and almost en-
gulfs I.C.U., but rather than
bore readers of Felix, I hope
that anybody who is interested
in these will come and chat to
me.
Thus, MARTIN C. BLACK "you
know it makes sense".
Mairi Waddington
With all the present publicity
about women in the Union Bar
etc., may I first assure you that
this is not another women's lib.
assault on the Union.
Yes—women in the Union Bar
but the best suggestion I've
heard is a reciprocal arrange-
ment of a take-over of the ICWA
lounge for a new snooker table
and/or pin ball machines!
Over the past two years I've
been Social Year Rep, on RCS
Ents committee, Assistant Secre-
tary of ICU Academic Affairs and
I've sat on Council as Maths
Department Rep., so I have con-
siderable expeirence in Union
Administration.
Basically I see the position of
Hon. Sec. as being an apolitical
one (politics are best left to
Presidents) and as being con-
cerned with the internal struc-
ture and running of the Union.
Although communication has
started to improve a little there
is a tremendous amount still to
be done. How many people
came away from the last Union
meeting feeling helpless in the
face of steam-rollering by those
who knew the suitable proced-
ural motions?
Improvement should start at
the bottom with the year reps,
becoming much more involved.
Each department should have a
publicity officer (one of the year
reps, perhaps?) to keep every-
one informed about what's going
on.
However hard work and a real
interest are needed and I am
prepared to put that hard work
into the job if you will vote for
me next Thursday. (After all,
think how safe your Union Fin-
ance would be with a Scot!)
This ought to be the
closest of all the elections
since both candidates
have much to recommend
them.
Anyone who has been
to a Union meeting cannot
have missed seeing Martin
Black. A women secretary
on the other hand will ap-
peal to a lot of people,
especially one who wants
to get things done.
Felix intends to remain
completely impartial in this
whole election. Owing to
the fact that nominations
did not have to be in till
yesterday, it is possible
that some people have not
had anything printed in
this article.
In order to prevent any
allegations of bias we
have decided to give
space in Felicity for any-
one not included before
and so I refer you to the
last ever Felicity!
