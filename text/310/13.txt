I am standing as your a l t e r n a t i v e candidate. A l l p o l i c i e s are b a s i c a l l y the
same. No one s e r i o u s l y wants a c o l l e g e d i c t a t o r s h i p , massive unemployment under
the present system, net: fio they want the country covered with motorways and heavy
chemical p l a n t s . Thus to the ordinary student the x b s s ± ± $ only d i i f e r e n c e among
the candidates i s what they are thought to represent. I f there i s no candidate with
whom the student can i d e n t i f y then a l l that r e g i s t e r s i s apathy, the bane of I C .
However, I b e l i e v e everyone i n ICU can understnad me and what I stand f o r - a per-
sonal union. To t h i s end I wish to introduce a new concept i n t o the e l e c t i o n arena
- a restructured u n i o n .
So f a r , l i t t l e d i s c u s s i o n has taken place i n the general student body, although
two reports have been submitted to c o u n c i l , jgjty m a i n p o l i c y i s t o attempt to b r i n g
ICU i n t o the present i n which i t i s l i v i n g . . . . w i t h two s a b b a t i c a l a f f i c e r s i t i s
ludicrous t o run i t on o d l ideas. However, t h i s would not be a p o l i c y imposed from
above but one e v e l v i n g from the student body under my gudiance.
I might add that I do not intend t o meddle i n academic a f f a i r s , e x t e r n a l a f f a i r s
or the number of other a c t i v i t i e s which should be the domain of t h e i r respective o f f -
i c e r s - I do i n t e n d t o c o n t r o l the channels i n t o which these a c t i v i t i e s are d i r e c t e d
so that they say be relevant t o you',.
