SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY - A IEW COURSE Chris Sheppard
For the past s i x months the I n d u s t r i a l Sociology Unit has been working i n close
conjunction with I . C . U . Academic A f f a i r s Committee to prepare a completely new
course i n ' S c i e n c e , Technology and S o c i e t y ' . The course has been devised i n
response to expressions of an i n c r e a s i n g awareness among students, academics
and p r a c t i t i o n e r s i n the various f i e l d s o f scinee and technology of the need
to emphasise i n courses of study the s o c i a l and personal consequences of the
a c t i v i t i e s of s c i e n t i s t s and t e c h n o l o g i s t s . The o v e r - r i d i n g o b j e c t i v e of the
course, t h e r e f o r e , i s t o help students t o become more aware of, and p e r s o n a l l y
concerned with the nature and wider i m p l i c a t i o n s of science and technology,
through an educational experience r e l a t e d t o t h e i r f e l t needs.
From i t s i n c e p t i o n students have been involved i n the preparation of the course,
and i t i s the needs of students that have been of prime consideration, throughout.
The course has gained 'academic approval' from the Board of S t u d i e s . The College,
h e w , remains as non-committal as ever, the Rector saying t h a t times are hard
and r e f u s i n g t o give i t any r e a l support. The College seems t o t a l l y unmoved by
the fact that a number of academics, both w i t h i n the c o l l e g e and o u t s i d e , have
shown tremendous i n t e r e s t i n the course (both Physics and E l e c . E n g . are already
wanting i t for next year) and i t has u n q u a l i f i e d support from the Union. For the
course t o get o f f the ground a minimum amount of around £2,000 i s r e q u i r e d
(with a maximum of around £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 ) . In terms of the number of students who could
b e n e f i t , and the educational value of the course, t h i s seems a r e l a t i v e l y small
p r i c e t o pay (the C o l l e g e ' s e l e c t r i c i t y b i l l i s £i+00,000 p . a . ) . The only way that
the College can be persuaded t o give any r e a l support t o i t s vague approval of
d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n i s by generating i n t e r e s t among s t a f f and students f o r courses
of tikis type. This must come through departments.
I f you want t o have a chance of t a k i n g t h i s course, i f you are at a l l i n t e r e s t e d
i n the broader relevance of the narrow d i s c i p l i n e that you are s t u d y i n g , then
f i n d out more about the course from your department rep. or from the Union O f f i c e .
Make sure that your voice i s heard i n your department and i n the College. Let
them give substance t o t h e i r support of the ' s p i r i t of d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n ' .

C0L FLETCHER
I f e e l that the best way that t h i s union can work for i t s members i s to give more
power t o the constituent c o l l e g e unions. Each constituent c o l l e g e union represents
o n e - t h i r d of the membership o f l C .
The v i c e - p r e s i d e n t s of IC (Presidents of the CCU's) are far more representative
of students than most members of c o u n c i l , therefore i t i s studpid t o t r y take them o f f
c o u n c i l when they can i n fact be mandated to b r i n g and represent before c o u n c i l the •
majority wich of o n e - t h i s d of ICU's members.
Can most members of c o u n c i l honestly say that they represent the members of u n i o n ,
c l u b , committee or department that e l e c t e d them?
ICU can work much b e t t e r i n t h i s way as i t can act as a b e t t e r f o c a l point for
student opinion by mailing sure that IC c o u n c i l IS representative of a l l students,
undergraduate and postgraduate, and not j u s t t o act as a loudspeaker for i n e f f e c t u r a l ,
petty p o l i t i c i a n s , who l i k e the sound of t h e i r own v o i c e s .
L e t ' s keep p o l i t i e s out of the u n i o n , and l e t the union f l o o r t e l l i t s e l e c t e d
representatives what the students want.
