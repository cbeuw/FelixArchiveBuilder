W H I T E W A S H :
Following the publication of her books, "Clean Up TV", and "Who
Does She Think She is?" and recent viists to "Disgusting Den-
mark". Mrs. Mary Whitehouse, Hon. General Secretary of the National
Viewers' and Listeners' Association (NVALA), attended a Touch-
stone gathering at Silwood Park last weekend. She addressed the
meeting on the dangers of declining moral standards emphasising
the immense effects of the broadcasting media, and was later
available for an exclusive FELIX interview on some of the wider
issues on which she has expressed views.
The address that Mrs. White- rarely comes into it. Two years
Mrs. Mary Whitehouse
at Touchstone
house gave consisted mainly of
an explanation of the work in
which she is currently engaged
and the fields in which she has
campaigned for the past eight
years. It was a great pity that
there was very little said with
which any but the most extreme
could disagree — this being
largely due to Mrs. Whitehouse
avoiding most issue of contro-
versial interest. She felt that a
stand for censorship ("no, I pre-
fer the word control") was
essential on all areas of life for
a free society.
Religion is undoubtedly the
basis of all Mrs. Whitehouse's
arguments. Against a back-
ground of comments such as
"Man is more than man — man
is a spiritual animal," spirtual
and religious points were con-
sistently used for justification.
The following morning two
FELIX staff conducted this inter-
view :
FELIX: Do you feel that occa-
sions such as this (Touchstone)
give you a feedback of peoples'
opinions and do you modify your
views accordingly?
MW: I think meetings such as
this are a good idea and I have
been impressed by the serious
attitudes of the people here.
Three years ago when I first
spoke at Cambridge Union I was
regarded as an outsider, a Phil-
istine, but now, with defences
down I think we are all sur-
prised just how much we have
in common.
FELIX: Would you say your work
could be summarised into being
a fight again pornography?
MW: Heavens no! Pornography
ago 24 Hours covered the shoot-
ing of a blue film in Denmark,
naturally we were concerned
about this. Basically my concern
is with TV but I do feel the. media
are indivisable. I am not on Lord
Longford's committee, but i do
work closely with him. With re-
gard to news broadcasts I do
feel that our first requirement
should be fair representation.
FELIX: You quoted in your talk
the claim that "Civilisation and
unbounded sex are incompat-
ible". Have you any experience
of this in modern society?
MW: Evidence at present is diffi-
cult to find. If we look back
through history, even modern
history, we can see the use made
of pornography by the Nazis and
Communists. Even in terms of
simple mathematics they are in-
compatible and I must say that
this is self-evident to me. Natur-
ally affairs between a man and
wife are nothing to do with me
but it is something to be aware
of. I think that couples should
not give only unto themselves
but also to others.
FELIX: Do you consider the work
of Martin Cole and Richard Nev-
ille to be sincere?
MW: These are two different
people. Dr. Martin Cole is inter-
ested in Dr Martin Cole full stop.
Publicity to Martin Cole is al-
most sexual satisfaction. He has
said publicy, "I do what I do to
purge myself".
Richard Neville is politically
motivated. He is committed to
his political beliefs.
FELIX: How great an extent do
you think broadcasting has in-
fluenced the standards of Mod-
ern Civilisation compared with
other social pressures?
MW: Why have drugs had such
power? It is certainly not sep-
arable from Broadcasting al-
though again I do feel that an
increasingly more responsible
attitude is being taken by the
BBC. Lord Hill has recently put
out a directive saying, "Drugs
Out".
FELIX: Do you know why the
ITA is composed in such a dif-
ferent form to the BBC.
MW: I suppose that the structure
is to reflect regional feelings.
TWW lost their licence because
of bad policy in Wales. I don't
agree with the ITA policy to-
wards London (i.e. LWT).
FELIX: You have spoken a lot
about a Broadcasting Council.
Could you say something about
its proposed constitution.
MW: We hope to produce a
paper on this later in the year.
FELIX: What responsibility to you
think magazines such as Pent-
house and Cosmopolitan should
feel?
MW: You may know that I was
used in a Cosmopolitan adver-
tisement as an obvious non-
reader. I am. I am disgusted by
suggestions portrayed in these
magazines, especially the wo-
men's ones.
FELIX: Could we ever return to
Status Quo?
MW: I see three definite courses
open to us:
1. Unbounded sex sowing its
own seeds of disaster.
2. Dictatorship.
3. Making Democracy work.
I would very much like to see
the latter.
On this note Mrs. Whitehouse
ended She will be returning for
an Associated Studies lecture
next year. After the chance of
seeing "Growing Up" I think she
should be worth seeing.

Gilbert Longden's (he is
a Conservative back-bench
MP) private member's bill
calling for a Student Union
Registrar ran out of time
when it was being dis-
cussed in the House of
Commons the Friday be-
fore last.
It was second on the
Order Paper that afternoon
but its debate didn't start
until about 3.45. The Par-
liamentary rules state that
a vote can't be taken if a
member still wishes to
speak at 4.00 p.m. Sure
enough this happened — a
Labour front bencher so
I'm told.
This means that on the
following Friday the bill
went to the bottom of the
order paper, giving it al-
most no chance of reach-
ing discussion and with
future bills coming in for
their second reading as a
higher priority, Mr. Long-
den has had his day.
Thus another short term
victory and one from which
a few points can be gained.
Firstly the Government
front bench took a non-
committal line, which
means it couldn't have
been so far away from their
idea of a Registrar as all
that. Secondly, MP's c a n
be very usefully lobbied —
the NUS Exec, had briefed
five Labour MP's to speak
for 26 minutes each if nec-
essary and the many tele-
grams sent to the Labour
Front Bench (including
one from ICU) might have
helped them to make up
their mind to speak at 4.00
p.m.
Two interesting a n d
alarming points that were
slipped into Longden's
idea of a Registrar were
firstly a clause with regard
to registration saying that
an application could be
made on behalf of a Stu-
dents' Union, i.e. meaning
a Governing Body could
register a Union with a
Constitution none of the
Union agreed with and sec-
ondly a clause saying all
monies must be spent to
directly benefit the indivi-
dual members — a warn-
ing light for such things as
Community Action, Rag
equipment, etc.
Anyway
day again.

WOMEN I
N UNION BAR
LIB AND B(R)AR
Unfortunately for the preserva-
tionists, Women's Lib seem to
have gained the upper hand in
the continuing fight for the
domination of the Union Bar.
A short while ago, Betty Gar-
butt and Co., Dave Hobman
(still smarting from his recent
expose in Felix) discovered that
there was no rule in the ICU
Constitution banning women
specifically from the Union Bar.
This news was quickly conveyed
to a clique led by an aggressive
youn gal named Betty who de-
cided to exploit the situation.
A newcomer to the IC political
scene, Betty is believed to be
engaged in 1st year Zoology
and resides in Beit.
Betty's plan was to invade the
Union Bar every day for a week
with a group of 'Women's Lib'
people. This plan was inaugur-
ated last Thursday and Betty
with such strange, but not un-
expected fellow or the cause as
Piers Corbyn and Dave Hobman,
along with several women and a
number of 'Heavies' presented
themselves at the Union Bar.
The IC lads, sensing trouble, lit
the fire in the Bar and retired
gracefully. After a successful
attempt to extinguish the fire by
the Heavies they were ignored
and normal activities were re-
sumed in the form of a drinking
match between Pete Earl and
Hilary.
The next night, Friday, proved
to be more interesting. The girls
returned again, this time in a
random fashion, to the bar, but
this time met heavier opposition
in the form of a Chap's Club
Dinner. Brendan, sensing trou-
ble, gradually persuaded the
women to leave in his normal
smooth way. Betty, however, not
aware of this, was doused with
a pint of beer for not moving,
although she had not yet been
subjected to Brendan's smooth
action, and has been so ob-
sessed with the darts playing
that she couldn't have been ex-
pected to have noticed anyway.
Betty continued playing darts
unperturbed until the treatment
was repeated. Whereupon the
familiar Union Bar chant was ini-
tiated and Betty was placed on
a table with a yard of beer and
given the choice of getting it or
them down.
Betty, not to be beaten, took
two sips and poured the remain-
der over a certain Mr. Mark
Woods (RSMU President), who
was standing close.
Finally, at this point, our atten-
tion moves to one of Betty's male
associates, who claims that dur-
ing the above festivities ad-
vances were made to Betty. He
was disgusted with the, and we
quote, 'horny old perverts pre-
sent in the Bar.' (Thinks, maybe
this is why we keep women out
of the Bar).
Dave Amos, the duty officer in
the Uinon on Friday night was
unfortunately unable to save
Betty from the clutches of the
Union Bar since he was just
about to move into action as she
was evicted after the incident
with Mr. Woods.

Start reading the bumph —
see the Candidates, ask ques-

Read the next issue of Snap-

be any? — keep fighting the
Green Paper) and many more.
What should we say at NUS? —
come and see me, let's have

Help Rag — they've got to
break even point on Rag Mag

one night — Any pre-selected
group can win a beer prize for
the most sold per capita — the

some home for Easter.
Should council spend £100 on

off. But do they do anything.
Start making yourselves heard—
don't accept the Union trash, the

you care.
