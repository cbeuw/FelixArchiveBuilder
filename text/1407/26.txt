CASHLESSBARS
In order to speed up serving times at our bars on the evening we will be
using a cashless bar system.
• Come with enough cash for the evening
• On arrival, go to one of our token stations
• Purchase as many tokens as you think you will need for the evening, we will
be selling them in multiples of 5; 1 token = £1
• Exchange your tokens for drinks at the bars without the worry of carrying
round change all night
Tokens can be purchased using cash or cards, we advise you bring along cash to
avoid unnecessary queuing. Tokens are valid at all bars in the Summer Ball including
da Vinci’s, dB’s and the Union Bar on selected drinks. Tokens are valid from 17:00 21
June 2008 until 10:00 22 June 2008.
