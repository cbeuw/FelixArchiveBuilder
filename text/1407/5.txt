S
tudents feared it for years, but even-
tually Tony Blair’s Labour
government got its way, and
in January of 2004 the latest Higher
Education Bill was passed by a a
margin of just five votes.
The Bill which allowed universi-
ties to charge variable Top-up fees
of upto £3,000 per year was success-
ful with 316 votes to 311. These votes
were accompanied by 18 very signifi-
cant abstentions.
Back in 2004, ICU greeted the pro-
posals with protests, and when the Bill
was finally passed the Union remained
resolute. “There is still plenty to fight
for” commented ICU’s Deputy President
(Education & Welfare).
University officials welcomed the re-
sults, and the Rector’s hopes became re-
ality. “I’m extremely pleased that attempts
to derail this vitally important bill have
not succeeded,” Sir Richard told Felix. “I’m
convinced that it will prove to be a positive
move both for universities, which desperate-
ly need extra funding to maintain standards,
and for young people ... who will have access
to the world class teaching we provide.”

hilst criticisng the government’s target to ensure that 50% of school leavers
carry on into higher education, Sir Richard managed to single out Luton
University as a “third rate” university. The Rector said that “third rate” insti-
tutions are a drain on better universities, stating that “a penny spent [at Imperial] is a
hell of a lot better than a penny spent at Luton for the economy.” He gave further criti-
cism saying that “it costs more to teach those kids [at third class institutions] because
they’ve never been taught.”
The comments landed Sir Richard in a spot of bother with university heads from
around the country, not just Luton’s Vice Chancellor. Some Vice Chancellors called
for him to resign from his position on HEFCE (the Higher Education Funding Council
for Education).
However, Sir Richard later retracted the comments and wrote to both HEFCE and
Luton’s Vice Chancellor, apologising for his “ill considered and clumsy” comments.
S
ir Richard climbed into a small, orange me-
chanical exoskeleton and chiselled away at
the old Southside complex, marking the
beginning of the end for the fondly remembered
halls of residence.
The ceremony signified the realisation of two
things: firstly, the Rector delivering on his prom-
ise of a reconstructed Southside, and secondly,
the beginning of Imperial’s status as a permanent
building site.
The building was scheduled to finish construc-
tion in October 2007, at a cost of more than £50m.
College almost delivered on this promise, but their
record of finishing nothing on time actually remains
intact. Many rooms lacked furnishings, toilet seats
were left unattached and some students still had
their windows boarded up with dust sheets.
E
thos eventually opened its
doors, four months after
it was originally sched-
uled to finish. Students flocked to
make use of the free facilities lead-
ing to a huge waiting list for gym
inductions.
The opening was very well re-
ceived, although some unfortunate
students had to be evacuated, drip-
ping wet, during the first week after
the fire alarm was activated.

C
ollege decided it would be sensible to introduce a
dress code, applicable to all staff and students, to
help “maximise our chances of detecting anyone
who shouldn’t be here.”
Members of Imperial were required to wear their swipe
cards at all times, and to refrain from wearing clothes that
obscured the face such as veils, scarves or hooded tops.
The decision, which attracted worldwide media atten-
tion, was one which the College has never really lived down
since. Only recently, the issue was raised at Union Council.
College later revised the code, explicitly stating that cul-
tural or religious garments were allowed and that students
only need to be able to present their swipe cards.

Imperial College have announced a
strict dress code for its students and
staff. Failure to comply could result
in students being “removed from
the College’s premises”.
The dress code states that “at all
times while on campus staff and stu-
dents must wear their College iden-
tity cards”. On top of this employees
and students are told to “refrain
from wearing clothing that obscures
the face such as a full or half veil,
hooded tops or scarves worn across
the face”. The rationale behind
this is that it will “maximise our
[College’s] chances of detecting the
presence of anyone who shouldn’t
be here”. According to Imperial, this
dress code has been implemented
“in light of security concerns raised
by the terrorist incidents which
occurred over the summer”.
The ruling appears to be quite
unenforceable as there are numer-
ous entrances to the College, and
there is a public right of way straight
through the middle of College along
Imperial College Road, connecting
Queens Gate to Exhibition Road.
It is clear that College also have
doubts about the enforceability of
the ruling. An Imperial spokesper-
son told Felix, “It’s not a question
of it being enforceable – rather it
is a question of College security.
We expect all students to take their
