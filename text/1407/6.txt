C
ollege had been discussing
moving towards independ-
ence from the University of
London (UL) for years. In 2006, talks
finally became reality when Imperial
felt it was big and ugly enough to fly
the UL nest.
Confirmation that IC would leave
UL came at the University of Lon-
don’s Council when the terms of
the withdrawal were agreed.
Students who started univer-
sity whilst IC was part of UL were
asked whether they wanted a de-
gree from Imperial or the Univer-
sity of London, the main differ-
ence apparently being the colour
of your graduation gown. Oh, and
continued admittance to some of
UL’s facilities such as the library.
Postgraduate students who
began in October 2007 are now
only eligible for Imperial de-
grees. UL degrees will no longer
be available to any students en-
rolling as of next year.
ICU soon followed in IC’s
footsteps by leaving UL Union,
saving itself around £80,000 per year.

ollege marked its 100th birthday with a year’s worth of
celebrations, beginning with the Rector cutting a very
tasty birthday cake.
Later on in the evening Sir Richard gave his Centenary lec-
ture in which he talked about the history of the South Ken-
sington campus. He even managed to slip in a small gibe about
Felix. When holding up a copy of the paper from 1957, he com-
mented: “This was back when Felix was a good newspaper.”
We love you too Dickie.

espite most recently ranking 5th in the Times Higher Education Supple-
ment’s World University table, Imperial still can’t resolve the perennial
problem of an unsatisfied student body.
Back in August 2007, the Good University Guide (GUG) published its latest data,
revealing Imperial as the third best university in the country. However, taking the
student satisfaction criterion out of the results pushed Imperial into first place.
Conversely, taking out all the criteria except student satisfaction placed Imperial
in 68th place.
Since then, students have become even more miserable, with Imperial slipping to
87th place in the student satisfaction stakes, according to the GUG 2009 statistics,
which were published in
April of this year. Reduc-
ing the student satisfac-
tion weighting to zero in
this latest data sees Impe-
rial in second, compared
to the previous year’s first
place.
In comparison, Cam-
bridge ranks first place
for student satisfaction
this year, with Oxford in
6th and UCL in 33rd.
Whether Oxford or
Cambridge are better
institutions than Impe-
rial is debatable, but the
dissatisfaction amongst
Imperial’s student body
is clear to see.
S
ir Richard continued in his out-
spoken manner in October of
last year, when he slammed the
UK’s education system, not for the
first time.
The Rector criticised so called
“Mickey Mouse” courses (ie: David
Beckham studies), saying that “the
system has to change. It will then
make people think twice before
they go off and do those damn silly
courses that are no good to them and
won’t get them a good job at the end
of the day. It would mean university
is not just a nice four years off.”
He also made clear his support of
increasing Top-up fees to £5,000 af-
ter the 2009 review.
