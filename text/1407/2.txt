The Church of Scientology’s UK headquarters based in London
The Church of Scientology’s anti-psy-
chiatry sub-group, the Citizens Com-
mission on Human Rights (CCHR),
will be coming to Exhibiton Road next
month, to picket an event being held at
Imperial.
The event in question is the Royal
College of Psychiatrist’s Annual Meet-
ing, which is being run on campus
from 1st July until the 4th July. It’s cur-
rently not clear whether the CCHR will
be protesting for all four days of the
conference.
The Royal College of Psychiatrists
is the professional and educational
body for psychiatrists in the United
Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The
organisation gives representation to
psychiatrists and aims to improve un-
derstanding of mental health problems
through research and education, ac-
cording to its website.
According to Scientologists, how-
ever, and more specifically its founder,
L. Ron Hubbard, “psychiatry is making
people insane.” This belief has been
held within the Scientology com-
munity for decades, and in 1969 the
CCHR was founded as a sub-group
of the Church of Scientology, in order
to investigate and expose “psychiatric
violations of human rights.”
Now it appears the CCHR’s lat-
est investigation will bring them to
Imperial.
An official from IC has said that Col-
lege is liaising with police to ensure
that protestors do not enter the uni-
versity’s premises. The police are being
supportive and any protestors will be
kept on the opposite side of Exhibition
Road away from the College’s main
entrance.
If members of the CCHR do turn
up, they can expect a heavy counter-
protest against their own rally from
members of anti-Scientologist group,
Anonymous. News of the CCHR’s pro-
test has spread quickly across internet
forums and many Anonymous mem-
bers have already declared that they
will be making an appearance at Exhi-
bition Road on 1st July.
Rumours that the new Rector, Sir
Roy Anderson, will spend his first day
in office out on the street protesting
against the CCHR, whilst wearing a
‘V For Vendetta’ mask are completely
unfounded.
