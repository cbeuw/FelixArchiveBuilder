Sir Richard Sykes has only three weeks
left of his seven and a half year term as
Rector of Imperial College, succeeded
by Sir Roy Anderson who officially
takes over in July. He leaves behind
him a very different College to the in-
stitution that he took over in January
2001. This week, Felix examines the
impact that he has had during his time
in South Kensington.
When Sir Richard was appointed as
the thirteenth Rector, Imperial faced
an uncertain future. Although IC was
well respected academically, and reg-
ularly placed second or third in the
league tables, College’s finances were
in a mess, governmental subsidies
were under debate and facilities were
in great need of modernisation. Col-
lege Council made the surprise choice
of appointing not an academic, but a
business leader to take care of these is-
sues and plan Imperial’s future: Sir Ri-
chard, then CEO of GlaxoSmithKline,
was picked to take control after Lord
Oxburgh’s departure.
The changes that he brought with
him were immediate, and his stated
aims were clear. Sir Richard’s vision of
the future of Imperial College was of
an internationally competitive “uni-
versity business” (as he referred to it),
a world famous centre of lucrative re-
search, modelled on the biggest suc-
cesses in the US. As these pages show,
he has more or less succeeded in these
aims: Imperial is now fifth in the THES
world rankings; the profile of College
has indeed been raised worldwide, es-
pecially in Asia (he even appointed a
Pro-Rector (International Relations));
College’s finances have expanded; out-
dated campus facilities are being refur-
bished and replaced; and research is
nowImperial’smainstrength.Butthese
achievements have not come with-
out price, and many have questioned
whether the direction that Imperial
has taken under Sir Richard serves the
university’s primary purposes.
Sir Richard himself has been almost
constantly surrounded by controversy
over the past 7 years, both within IC
and nationally, due to his outspoken
views and “authoritative” style of re-
form. He has attracted criticism from
College staff, academics and students
for his approach; ‘absence’ of consulta-
tion with the members of the univer-
sity; his business focus (Sir Richard is
also Chairman of the ‘Reform’ think-
tank: a lobbying group that pushes
for more private sector involvement
in public services); support for top-up
fees; and the magnitude of his salary,
which at £348,000 is the UK’s largest for
the head of an educational institution.
To get the full picture of the changes
that Sir Richard has made since 2001,
one needs only to look at the differenc-
es in College statistics between then
and today.
Since 2001
The most obvious changes that Sir Ri-
chard has made are in the student body
and departmental research. It is in
augmenting these aspects of the Col-
lege that he has increased the income
so greatly and safeguarded IC’s finan-
cial future. However, the changes are
drastic, and have almost certainly had
unforeseen repercussions.
The number of full time students at
Imperial has increased by 22% over
the seven years, from 9975 students
in 2001 to 12129 students last year – a
massive change in number. In addition
to this, the makeup of those students
has also changed drastically.
In 2001, 20% of full time students at
Imperial were Overseas students, com-
ing from countries outside of the UK
and EU. This was similar to the pro-
portions within comparable universi-
ties such as Oxford, Cambridge, UCL,
Harvard and Yale. Last academic year,
however, the picture at IC was very

different. 30% of full time students
are now from outside the UK and EU
combined, a massive proportion for
a relatively small student population.
UK students make up only 40% of the
total, and according to statistics, stu-
dents from China now make up ap-
proximately 15-20% of the students at
Imperial College. IC now has a larger
proportion of Overseas students than
all of the comparable UK and US insti-
tutions by a significant amount.
Similarly, when we examine the in-
crease in the total number of students,
we find that there are 2154 more stu-
dents at IC now than when Sir Rich-
ard entered as Rector, but of these new
places only 514 have gone to Home
and EU students combined. The rest
have gone to Overseas students. Over
the last 7 years, for every Home/
EU student place created, there have
been more than three Overseas places
created.
This trend is reflected in the bal-
ance sheets, and thus the financial
planning of the College. In 2001 fees
from Overseas students accounted for
5.6% (£22m) of College’s income, and
in 2007 this increased dramatically to
10.1% (£56m) of the total income. This
suggests that Imperial’s financial sta-
bility now relies almost twice as heav-
ily on Overseas fees. This sum has not
just been increased by recruiting more
Overseas students though. The fees
charged have also increased dramati-
cally, with an increase in the average
from £11,055 to £15,427 between 2001
and 2007 (compared to the average
Home/EU of £1,578 to £1,894 – prob-
ably largely due to Top-up fees).
However, this 22% increase in the to-
tal number of students is not matched
by a proportional increase in spend-
ing on teaching. The number of aca-
demic staff has decreased since 2001
from 3531 Full-Time-Equivalent staff
to 3067 FTE staff. Similarly the aver-
age academic’s proportion of teach-
ing time has decreased from 22.6% to
roughly 18.5% in 2006. This is again
significantly lower than either of our
main UK competitors, Oxford (23%)
and Cambridge (21.5%), especially giv-
en the distribution of teaching load per
subject. This is especially significant
since science subjects require far more
teaching time than the humanities
which will certainly affect the Oxford
and Cambridge averages.
It would appear that our academics
are, under Sir Richard, spending far
less time teaching than they used to.
This decrease is matched by a mas-
sive rise in the average amount of time
spent on research, increasing from 44%
to approximately 53% over the 7 years.

Worth it?
As was previously stated, Sir Richard
has undoubtedly achieved his aims as
Rector of Imperial College, rebranding
and all, but the statistics lend weight to
the arguments of his critics. Whether
his business-like attitude and focus on
the corporate nature of the College is
best suited to its primary purpose of
education and research is still very
much under debate.
From the experience of being a stu-
dent here, and from the statistics them-
selves, it appears that criticisms of this
approach are valid. Students seem to be
paying more for their degree, but receiv-
ing less and less teaching. The support
structures and social aspects of the Col-
lege appear ill-equipped to cope with
such a radical demographic change,
leading to a divided and isolating cam-
pus which feels, to many students, re-
markably impersonal and uncaring.
What is certain is that the focus
at Imperial is no longer on students.
Whether this trend spreads across
the country as universities struggle to
compete for funding and elite status,
or reverses with the incoming Rector
and his more academic experiences,
remains to be seen.
