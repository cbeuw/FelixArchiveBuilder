O-Bitch-uaries... Why God, why?!
Not that you’ll miss these chumps pictured below. Maybe their families will put these obituraies to good use
sometime soon. I give the Sabbatical Officers 10 minutes in the real world... maybe 15 for Tomo, if he’s lucky
From left to right: Alistair Cott (DPChuffSucker), Stephen “Destroy the Unions” Brown, Kirby... I mean Kirsty Patterson, Chris Larvin (it up), Don Tomash Roberts
Alistair Cott
Cause of death: Auto-erotic as-
phyxiation... look it up
T
was as a child that Alistair
Cott was shunned by his
peers due to the scien-
tific anomaly of being
born with that rather im-
pressive animal latched onto his chin.
Needless to say, the foreign object
fused with Alistair’s facial area within
his first year upon the planet, and then
the two became one. He still referred
to it as Vladimir Kostnidov up until his
finals days on this great planet.
Alistair’s successes in life have been,
well... minimal. He did one time win
the chicken wrangling contest at the
local parish fair. His childhood dream
was to spend his adulthood living
amongst the cannibal tribes of Papa
New Guinea... sadly it was not to be.
It is a sad day, my friends when a
man passes away while doing, well, you
know... what he does... Er...
For Alistair Cott, this day came when
he realised that the entirety of his time
as DP (Clubs & Societies) encompassed
nothing but the Fresher’s Fair.
Alistair spent the duration of his
Imperial degree perfecting his ability
to store his worldly possessions in his
‘Beard’ and playing shuffleboard with
an imaginary friend.
The news of his death has prompted
his friends to send in photographs of
Alistair’s ‘Beard’ glimmering in sun-
light from 82 different angles.
“OMFG... I Just sent this text and it
appeared on the newspaper! How the
fuck? Lemme try again”
Condolences from
the Student Body
“Oh shit! It worked! I’ve got to tell
someone, this is amazing! Hey you!
Check this out! What’s that you’ve got
in your hand? What are you so pleased
Stephen Brown
Cause of death: Choked on his
accent
W
ay before you jump
to any conclusions,
any correlation
with Alistair Cott’s
death is purely co-
incidental. Mr Brown was in no way
watching Cott, exclaiming in that rus-
tic Scottish brogue: “That’s it Alistair,
give it what for!”
When asked as a child what he be-
lieved his future held for him, Stephen
promptly replied: “I will become the
next Margaret Thatcher! There were
nothong wrong with Maggie, uhh yeah,
she were alrite.” Stephen spent many
a weekend prancing in his mothers
high heels, wearing her make-up and
flouncing around in her best dresses.
Stephen “The Boy Wonder” Brown
has accomplished many feats through-
out his obviously interesting life. He
learned to speak at age 6, hold a spoon
at age 7 and was oppressing the masses
at age 9. However, his ultimate achieve-
ment was beating Rector Sykes in the
best thumb-war he’d ever had. The
video was watched on YouTube over
7.4 billion times by one person.
The death of Stephen Brown has come
as a surprise to everyone except the Ant
Kingdom, which was plotting his assas-
sination from the moment he could hold
a spoon. This man was loved by few, re-
spected by even fewer and is guaranteed,
in death, to make everyone’s day.
Kirsty Patterson
Cause of death: Heart attack
caused by steroid abuse
A
lmost always full of ad-
venture, Kirsty spent her
childhood whiling away
her summers playing
with little Tiffinay. Tragi-
cally this ended when little Tiffinay
was diagnosed with motor neurone
disease. Kirsty swiftly went from chav
to emo, falling into a downwards sprial
of sex ,drugs & rock ‘n’ roll emo.
In an attempt to rid herself of her
negative image, Kirsty went to Imperial
College London to start afresh. Whilst
at IC, Kirsty didn’t hesitate to make
NO friends, choosing to flirt outra-
geously with certain highly placed Un-
ion representatives to finally become
DP (Education & Welfare). During her
time as Deputy President, Kirsty made
revolutionary changes to IC welfare
with triumphs such as S.H.A.G week
(admit it you had fun).
Kirsty was found last week in the
women’s changing room in Ethos,
where she had been living since her
well documented break up with Hugh
Jackman... The staff and regular users
are said to have believed she was mere-
ly taking a prolonged nap. Her death
was caused by the overuse of steroids
causing vital bodily fluids to build up
in her muscles, eventually collapsing
upon themselves.
Kirsty will be sorely missed... I
couldn’t keep a straight face either.
Chris Larvin
Cause of death: Ink poisoning
related suffocation
T
he Hangman team are
genuinely upset about this
one. He was our favourite.
Chris is one hell of a
party animal. He did not
let the fact that he is a half man, half
gnome stop him from being a real hit
with the ladies/men, although at Impe-
rial, there’s not too much to tell them
apart... let your imagination run wild.
Known for being able to down a yard
in 0.000009 seconds, Larvae’s reputa-
tion amongst the gnome community
was immense, earning him the title of
Beit Hall Gnome-in-Chief.
The now, sadly, former DPFS is
said to have died slowly and painfully
screaming for forgiveness for that one
night of passion he so desired with a
7-year old.
Chris’ death from ink poisoning was
caused by over-zealous use of the Un-
ion entry stamp... He was said to have
been heard screaming; “It’s not the
Easter Carnival anymore you incom-
petent morons!”
He was found lying in a paddling
pool full of Union money with polaroid
pictures of himself making out with a
cash register... Yeah that’s right, that
tight one in da Vinci’s.
We would like to pay tribute to Chris
Larvin and honour his memory by re-
fusing to attend the Summer Ball as a
sign of protest. RIP.
Tom Roberts
Cause of death: Chronic allergy to
sunlight
S
wahili Felix Editor-in-Chief,
known to his enemies as Don
Tomash, and his friends...
well, as Tom the Bomb, is a
complete moron, and quite
frankly we’re glad he’s dead.
Abused as a child by the neighbour’s
cat, Tomo had a perpetual fear of the
Felix mascot and a disturbing tendency
to watch German shisha porn on full
volume when the rest of us were trying
to work.
Tomo made many promises in his
time at Imperial, lying and cheating to
get to the top. However, being such a
spaff stain on the bed sheets of life, he
died having accomplished nothing but
a scarily pale demeanour and dishev-
elled appearance.
To pay for his coke habit, and the
welfare checks of his numerous chil-
dren, Tomash became an underground
crime lord. Beating up many an old
woman and relieving small children of
their mobile phones, Tomash started
out small. He recently ran the larg-
est drug syndication this side of the
Thames.
A pool of human flesh was found
in Beit Quadrangle early one morn-
ing. Information was hazy, but since
then witness reports have clarified that
Tomo was unable to scurry back to the
Felix offices before the sun rose.
May he never rest in peace.
about? Aargh! No! You’re stabbing me!
Oooh mmm, I mean ouch!”
“I will never forget your beaming smile
Kirsty.
Love, XXX (Triple X).
xxx (Those are the kisses, not my
name...)”
