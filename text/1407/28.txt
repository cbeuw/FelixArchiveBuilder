Fun & Games
Virgo
This week,
everybody has
finished their
exams except
you. You stupid
fucking biologist/
biochemist/retard. Everybody else is drinking,
partying, enjoying the sun, being attractive
and socialising you are stuck in your room
learning the equation of a line. I did that for
GCSE you cunt! When you finish your exams
everyone has left Imperial, no fun for you! HA!
Scorpio
Now that I’m
relaxed, I then
begin to remove my
trousers slowly and
steadily all the while
feeling the sexiest
I have ever felt. I then begin to feel my penis
becoming tumultous, almost a homing beacon
for all eroticism in the room. I then grabbed
my penis and begin to stroke it violently until
climax. What?! Why can’t having a wank be
romantic? You fucking prude.
Libra
Tonight is gonna
be the night. It’s
all gonna happen
tonight. I got the
Candles lit, I got
my Barry White
on the CD player and I’m wearing my clean
underwear. Things are hotting up, I put on
some nasty Eastern European grade porn. I
unzip my trousers and then get comfortable
sofa, drink a bit more wine so I am relaxed.
Sagittarius
This week you
feigned interest
in the Euro 2008
soccerball league
cup in order to win
the respect of your
peers. They however find you out when some
team or other scores a goal you shout, “COME
ON EILEEN!” You then realise that dummie’s
guide to football was published in 1986 and
you look a right prick. It’s okay because foot-
ball is a pile of shit anyway.
Capricorn
Would you like a
cider or a cock in ci-
der? You could have
a picture of a rooster
and a bottle of Mag-
ners or something
Can I have some chew gum please Mr poker
shark... Ok, so this was sent in by one lovely
reader and it makes absolutely no sense to me,
whatsoever. It did when she said it verbally, but
now I realise she’s totally batshit crazy.
Cancer
If you recognise
yourself in the
photo below, then
PLEASE CALL
07777777777777
Gemini
I’m nearing the end
of my tether, want
to see my tether?
Well, get a fucking
microscope because
that is the only
way you can see I am so far near the end. You
make me want to swallow a child’s skeleton
and then butter up a camel’s tongue whilst
cross-dressing into a Albanian milkmaid. That
is how fucked up I am right now, I could just I
don’t know, FELCH A FUCKING TADPOLE?
Leo
Whoa, sorry about
Cancer’s entry, but
I saw this cute little
hottie in the club the
other day and I just
gotta know where
she went. She was a pretty little thing who
smoked constantly like a Hollywood starlet.
And best of all, when I went to go give her
some international aid south of the border, she
had the biggest dick and balls I’ve ever felt. I’m
onto a winner here.
Taurus
I hope you enjoy
your summer like I
enjoyed pounding
on your gonorhea-
riddled mother last
night. Oh yeah, she
was like filling a festering teenager boil with
small meat packets. Is this offensive enough
yet? No. Okay, well what can else can I say?
Well, have you ever had sex with a corpse, that
would be infinitely preferable to mowing the
diseased sore that is your mother.
Aries
Pi is exactly equal to
3. Deal with it you
prick.
Pisces
You are the worst ex-
cuse for a human be-
ing I have ever seen.
You are the kind of
person who actually
makes a conscious
effort to litter the streets. I hope your colon
fills up with fire-breathing ants and they slowly
blister you from the inside until all the doctor
can do is pop you in a giant iron lung and then
get the cleaners to mop you up and reconstruct
you using a jelly mould and a fridge.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week after 8
weeks in the library,
you snap. That guy
who has sat behind
you for the past two
months who kept
clicking his pen has pissed you off no end.
You jump from behind your desk and then
grab that pen from his filthy fingers and get
the nearest piece of paper and write him the
angriest note ever. You feel somehow your
Britishness has let you down again.

Needy McNeedy: speaking on iPhone since ‘54
H
ave any of you guys tak-
en my advice to heart?
I’ve been noticing an in-
flated mood this week;
students were seen par-
tying in the quad, and a general air of
summer joy seems to be creeping in
to Imperial. Either that, or you’re all
getting high off the hayfever drugs.
Summer’s started kids! Email agony.
felix@imperial.ac.uk to tell me about
the amazing time you’re all having. Or
not.
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I’m really worried about finding a
house next year. I’ve got a group of
mates that I’m planning to share with,
but there are quite a lot of us and no-
body actually seems to be searching for
houses to view. We haven’t had experi-
ence with this kind of thing before and
people are beginning to argue over lit-
tle things. How do I choose the right
people to live with next year?
Distressed
Dear Distressed,
Don’t live with anyone who has the fol-
lowing character traits: any bad habits,
crazy sleeping patterns, and adversity
to cleanliness. You know that guy who
you go out with quite often, and think
is really fun? Imagine getting up to go to
an exam and finding that in a drunken
haze he came home and vomited in
your clean laundry. You can still meet
up with him for nights out. Secondly,
and most importantly, live with a small
number of people. You get to know them
better, you’ll have more space to share,
and there’ll be more love and kindness
between you, which, as avid Needy fans
will know, is what I’m all about.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I’ve finished all my exams but now
I’m left with a floor full of paper: revi-
sion notes, exam papers and the like.
I’ve been ignoring them for a while: I
usually wade through them to get to
my bed but the other night I heard
some buzzing and I fear there might be
dirty crockery under there (plus some
assorted home grown wildlife). Do
students really burn their notes after
exams?
DirtyFloor
Dear DirtyFloor,
Yes, my friend, yes they do. Get a large
black bin liner and scoop all flammable
items off your floor, and turn them into
a barbeque for your friends and fam-
ily. No, seriously, I saw it on Blue Peter
once. You can grill chicken on them, but
make sure to marinate it first in some
soy/chilli/spice, so that it’s extra tasty.
I learnt that from TV as well. It’s full
of all the best tips, especially the stuff
they show in the daytime when all those
people who can afford barbeques are
out at work.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I applied for a few internships over
the summer, but as I’m generally in-
competent I didn’t get offered any and
I’ve decided to go travelling instead. A
couple of friends want to come along,
and we’re looking for something really
out of the ordinary to do, as it’s our
last free summer before the end of our
degrees. What exciting things can I do
with my summer?
ExtrepidTraveller
Dear ExtrepidTraveller,
What do you think I am, a travel agent?
Why the hell would I care that you and
your obviously well minted mates are
confused as to which beautiful beach to
visit and get that inevitable “I’ve been
travelling” photo of you in front of the
azure sea/rainforest. For God’s sake, go
to a European city and try to visit some
art galleries or something. It might just
knock some culture into you.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
My boyfriend is really close to one of
his female friends, and I’m convinced
that he’s cheating on me with her. I
read a text on his mobile in which she
said “see you at 8 xxxxx” and then he
told me he was going out with some of
his other friends that night. How can I
find out the truth about my boyfriend’s
relationship with this girl?
Crying
Dear Crying,
Nobody wants to go out with a paranoid
freak that checks their text messages. I
think he’s well shot of you.
