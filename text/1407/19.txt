Arts
Be Inspired: sketch, doodle, create!
Not content with what the standard colouring-in books have to offer, Felix Arts is offering you a chance to
unleash the creative genius lurking behind that logician’s brain of yours, and even have the chance to win
a free hug from the editor of your choice! Let your imagination be carried away: using the picture below as
‘inspiration’, bring your pieces of art down to us in the Felix dungeon or email them in. Or simply use this as
an opportunity to dispel any boredom that the end of exams has brought on. Ready, steady, draw!
