I t may seem s t r a n g e t h a t n e t b a l l matches o t h e r t h a n
those rough, and tumble games w i t h the men a r e p l a y e d by a
v e r y e n t h u s i a s t i c team. Indeed, these mixed matches, w h i c h
have caused so much i n t e r e s t , were i n t e n d e d p r i m a r i l y as
p r a c t i c e . T h e i r u s e f u l n e s s can be measured by t h e successes
s c o r e d by t h e women, who have l o s t o n l y one of t h e i r 4 league
matches and one of t h e i r 3 o r d i n a r y f i x t u r e s .
The S o c c e r Club a r e always dangerous opponents and they
were chosen f o r t h e f i r s t mixed match. I n i t they r a n r i n g s
round the women and s c o r e d an easy w i n (This may be due t o
the f a c t t h a t t h e g i r l s do n o t f l o u r i s h on c a r r o t s a t h a l f

i t was p l a y i n g t h e Rugger C l u b , t h e Wanderers o r . t h e P h i l a n d e r e r s
but was sure of i t s w i n . Prom a s p o r t i n g p o i n t o f view, t h e
b e s t games were p r o v i d e d by t h e Hockey Club and the h o s t e l .
In s p i t e of b e i n g unused t o h a n d l i n g a b a l l t h e Boat Club
gave a good game, b u t at h a l f time seven t h i r s t y women watched
