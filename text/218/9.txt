Really Mr. Williams!
Dear Sir,
Why must lan Williams set himself up to slay everything he
criticises in "Felix." After last term's slamming of " Pheonix " he
now turns the full blast of his bigoted and self-opinionated views
on the new Folk Club L.P. This in itself shows monumental irresponsi-
bility on his part, since we have 100 copies to sell and Mr. Williams has
given it such a great recommendation at the outset.
The most infuriating aspect of his review however, is that it is
totally unfair and misleading. Everyone who has heard the test
pressing is agreed tliat it is the best record produced in this College to
date, both musically and in the quality of recording. Even Mr.
Williams- must agree that it would be downright stupidity to expect
absolute perfection in a record of this nature so why must he be
so uncharitable. Minor flaws there are, of course, but for someone of
Mr. Williams' limited knowledge
of Folk Music to accuse Derek
Hall of poor timing is absurd.
Neither are his remarks about the
Echo Mountain Boys ' diction
valid, the words are perfectly
clear and audible. Perhaps Editor
Walker's record player needs a
new stylus. As for Ivor Smith's
"fluctuations in tone," perhaps
Editor Walker needs a new record
player. Or perhaps lan Williams
should stop trying to build himself
an image as a super-critic and a
perfectionist and come down to
earth.
Yours sincerely,
BRIAN BULL,

Tepid Water
Dear Sir,
The only non-alcoholic beve-
rage that the staff would serve at
the buffet of the recent May Ball
was tepid water. For such an
important Union occasion this
just is not good enough. I am
sure that my partner and I were
not the only teetotalers present,
and on behalf of those attending
future functions, could something
please he done to ensure that in
future sufficient variety of liquid
refreshments is provided.
Yours sincerely,
MELVYN OWEN.
A REPLY
Dear Sir.
I write, in a personal capacity to reply to the criticisms of the
I.C.A.Sc.W. voiced in a letter in Felix of May 12th. These criticisms
implied that the A.Sc.W. Branch was adopting resolutions outside its
terms of reference and by our Rules, I, as secretary, am charged with
the responsibility for seeing that this does not occur.
The present Branch Rules were drawn up by a sub-committee of
four academic staff members in 1950 and they wrote into the Rules
the " Right of members to raise any matter relevant to the aims of
the Association at a General Meeting." This right we cherish and
hence any motion can be brought forward.
The aims of the Association under which the motions were
brought forward were:
(1) To secure the wider application of science and the scientific method
for the welfare of society;
(2) To watch over promote and
protect the common and indivi-
dual interests of its members.
As always it is for our members
to decide at a general meeting
whether they do or do not support
these resolutions or any others
that may be brought forward. I
find, as Secretary, that for every
"National" topic there are
twenty more brought forward
dealing with working conditions,
salaries, safety, grants etc.
Yours sincerely,
H. Fairbrother.
Ed.â€”The above letter has been
condensed due to lack of space.
It originally contained the exact
wording of the two motions that
were criticised in a letter (see last
issue of Felix.)
Wall daubing
Dear Sir,
The College has very evidently
been suffering of late from the
depredations of a plague of wall
daubers. This crude and ugly
method of gaining publicity is
normally associated with colour
prejudiced urchins and the flotsam
of the C.N.D. Perhaps next time
the gentlemen concerned might
remember that they have left the
sixth form and exercise a little
of the wit and sense of responsi-
bility which, rumour has it, made
them undergraduates.
Yours sincerely,
DAVID A. B. PEARSON
