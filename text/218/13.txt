YOG AT LARGEI
Last Sunday, Wonderful Radio
Tizard was again linked by E a r l y -
worm, the underground cable . to
Radic Beit. There was a 3-? hour
interchange of programmes, with
Beit Sunday Show from 8.30 to 10.0
and Ten to Twelve u n t i l midnight.
Under the directorship of Guilds
President, Yog Bishop, WRT v i s i t e d
Soho on Friday night. They took a
number of recordings, which i n -
cluded a stree side punch-up,an
interview with a f i s h and chip
shop man, interviews outside the
Compton Cinema commenting on the
photographs displayed, and a l i v e
recording of a s t r i p show. They
managed to record one whole sequ-
ence, recording the reactions of
the audience. The management did
not seem to mind, as long as they
didn't do i t again. A l l t h i s was
broadcast on WRT on Sunday night.
The WRT remote unit has prev-
i o u s l y v i s i t e d Battersea Fun F a i r ,

NUS AND A L L THAT.
"So the men of NUS i n t h i s Col-
lege would have us believe that the
mighty Imperial has no voice i n the
world outside? Well then, I would
humbly recommend that they read
Friday's D a i l y Telegraph, where the
suggestion that students have en-
ough beer money already, quoted
from. Thursday's IC Union meeting,
received as much space as the rant-
ings of NUS saying " I t ' s not en-
ough" and a l l t h e i r usual c l i c h e s .
Forget not George's y^0
Brothers!

UNION ELECTIONS.
As we go to "press, the following
have been nominated f o r posts i n the
Union: Adrian Fletcher, the Walter
Lippmann of IC, has been nominated
and f u l l y seconded for the post of
President - to be decided by council
on June 10th. He i s a t h i r d year
Physics student, ex-chairman of
RCS Entertainments, and an ex-RCS
rep. on council. He has even rowed
i n the head of the r i v e r race, and
i f he had not come to IC would have
made a copybook army d r i l l sergeant.
There are so f a r two nominations
for Secretary - Chris Molam, already
having been elected Vice-President.
These are P h i l Dean of RCS, t h i s
year's Chairman of IC Ents., and
John Taylor, ex-Vice-President of
Mines. Also the only nomination f o r
Chairman of ACC i s Kerry Peters,
ex-everything, a most deserving
winner of the IC Union general
award. Ted.
DAYLIGHT ROBBERYI
Thanks to the incompetence of the
ex-Vice-President of IC Union,
Barry Mair, Miss Irene Riding's
Triumph Herald car was towed away
to the Car Pound from the back of
the Union. The p o l i c e had decided
to s t i c k no parking notices a l l
round the Albert H a l l at 11 o'clock
one morning, and l e f t a message i n
the Union f o r a l l cars to be r e -
moved by 1 o'clock. Mr. Mair en-
trusted with t h i s d e l i c a t e task
could not have taken the trouble
even to have v i s i t e d Jock Henry to
f i n d out who Miss Riding was, f o r
no message ever reached her, with
the r e s u l t that the poor g i r l had
to cross London and pay £2 to
r e t r i e v e her car.
