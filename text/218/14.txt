The record features: the Way-
f a r e r s , Derek H a l l , Ivor Grayson-
Smith and the Echo Mountain Boys,
and s e l l s a t a mere £1.
I f you have any doubts about
q u a l i t y , please note that Derek
H a l l , Anne Hay and the Echo Moun-
t a i n Boys have a l l been offered
recording a u d i t i o n s and contracts
on the strength of t h e i r perform-
ances on t h i s LP.
This record i s by f a r the best
amateur production of any musical
s o c i e t y i n Great B r i t a i n , despite
comments made by c e r t a i n people.
Note that Derek H a l l has turned
p r o f e s s i o n a l , and can be expected
to become a well-known a r t i s t e i n
a few months' time. Thus t h i s disc
may w e l l be a c o l l e c t o r ' s item i n
the near f u t u r e . B.B.
Nudism i n B e i t ,
I t i s "re'ported that during the
l a s t week the E d i t o r of F e l i x took
a bath! A c t u a l l y , he took i t no-
where, but placed himself i n i t ,
f o r the purpose of washing. At
one stage, we are l e d t o b e l i e v e ,
he found i t necessary t o leave i t
to v i s i t another 'room', being a
well-brought-up l i t t l e boy. Un-
f o r t u n a t e l y a young lady, l e a v i n g
the 'room', was confronted w i th the
naked torso of Mr, W a l k e r . Leaning
backwards w i t h surprise Nick beat
a hasty r e t r e a t . He seems t o have
suffered no i l l e f f e c t s from h i s
ordeal. The young l a d y , however,
has never been seen again.
A Candid Eye,
IC TAKE LONDON BUS.
During the course of an outing
of a c e r t a i n College s o c i a l club
l a s t Thursday evening, an unfor-
tunate s i t u a t i o n arose, whereby the
conductress f e l t i t necessary t o
stop the bus on which v a r i o u s
club members were t r a v e l l i n g .
One member, enraged a t the thought
of l o s i n g h i s fourpenny bus r i d e ,
climbed i n t o the d r i v e r ' s seat
and was a l l ready t o d r i v e away,
when he r e a l i s e d one v i t a l t h i n g -
he had no idea where the s t a r t e r
was ! ( a c t u a l l y i n the r o o f ) . He
was eventually ejected, and the
bus, a f t e r a considerable delay,
f i n a l l y ambled o f f .
EDITORIAL.
Ex-Late News E d i t o r , Ted
Needham, wishes t o thank a l l h i s
s t a f f f o r t h e i r a c t i v e co-operation
throughout the year. Few people
r e a l i s e that i t " t a k e s us at l e a s t
four hours t o produce t h i s rubbish
on Monday night, and as i s pain-
f u l l y obvious, people i n the
College do not come forward with
reports of clubs, s o c i e t i e s and
other functions, so we g e n e r a l l y
have t o concoct i t ourselves.
T h i s , Ladies and Gentlemen, i s
a proud admission, f o r people t e l l
me they sometimes a c t u a l l y read
Late News, why I don't know.
Also, I must thank the people
who seem t o make a l l the news, i n
t h i s College. I must s i n g l e out
four people whose names have
appeared more times than any other:
Dave Bishop, Adrian F l e t c h e r ,
E d i t o r Walker and myself. Without
these four, t h i s paper simply
would not have been p o s s i b l e .
F i n a l l y I wish a l l the luck i n
the world t o Tim (knocker) Doe, of
Zoolcgy, who w i l l be t a k i n g over
the Late News c h a i r next term. He
i s already equipped with one c f
the best i n v e n t i v e minds i n the
business, and has already a rather
b e a u t i f u l t y p i s t J
