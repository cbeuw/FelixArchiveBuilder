KIDNAPPING
A scries of kidnappings of prominent constituent college per-
sonnel took place a fortnight ago. On 19th May, Keith Cavanagh,
who had been proposed for the RCS Presidency, was taken into cus-
tody by Guildsmen about 9 p.m. to a hideout near Gloucester Road.
Later that night news leaked out that Cavanagh's opponent, Mike,
Scott, of Zoology 3, had won in the election. At 2 a.m., therefore,
Scott was roused from his sleep at Silwood to be taken, clad only in
pyjamas, to the same address.
Meanwhile Cavanagh had escaped wearing a blanket in lieu
of his trousers. Greater care was taken to secure Scott, who spent
the night tied up in an armchair. Under the cover of a blanket,
however, he manager to free himself and made a valiant but futile
run around 5.30 a.m. to the front door.
T A K E N FOR A RIDE
Later that morning he was taken for a run in a Guilds van, but
was unable to attract the attention of the police force to his plight.
At 11 a.m. Scott was hustled into the Guilds Union Office.
In retaliation a group of RCSmen had captured David Bishop,
the President of City and Guilds, who had obligingly spent a late
morning in bed. He, too, was trussed up and taken for a ride.
Hasty consultations ensued which led to Bishop's return to
C & G and Scott's to RCS—just in time for the official announcement
of his success to the RCS Union Meeting.
