Union Meeting opposes
Grants structure
By D. I. WILLIAMS
A letter is to be sent to the Ministry of (Education and Science
in protest against the failure of the Government to abolish the Means
Test or promote annual reviews of student grants in relation to the
cost of living index. This action, in response to last week's announce-
ment of increased awards to undergraduates, came as something of
a surprise in a Union Meeting last Thursday that was otherwise
almost exclusively an occasion for electing representatives to next
Council and mutual back-slapping
The most deserving winner of an IC Union General Award was
Mr. Coomber, now retired from the Athletic Grounds Committee,
who has been largely responsible for giving IC some of the best facili-
ties in the country. Other UGA winners were: Nick Walker, editor
of Felix; Brian Bull, president of the Folk Song Club ; Christopher
Tye, one of the mainstays of IC Union ; Kerry Peters, " an all-round
club-man"; and Barry Mair, the Union's first Deputy President.
Norman Price, the President, and Barry Utting, Secretary, received
their awards ex-officio.
Chris Molam was elected unopposed as Deputy President. RCS
will be represented on Council by Peter Finch and Kith Cavanagh.
T.vo recounts led to Fergus Kerr and Pete Ray representing RSM,
a.id Barry Mair and Warwick Farille C & G. The charge in the con-
stitution of the Entertainments Committee was endorsed ; for the first
time in many years here will be no women on the committee.
The annual reports of the chairmen of ACC, RCC, and SCC
were lively and at times entertaining. Mr. Anand's " ICSFRE "—
whatever that may stand for" provoked some amusement. In pro-
proposing a vote of thanks for all that President Price had done this
year, Chris Tye exposed the little-known fact that he had carried
out his duties in spite of no grant.

implemented, this scheme would,
of course, hit worst those who
have difficulty in extracting the
remainder of their grants from
their parents.
Mr. A. Stephenson, the Senior
Warden, is expected to present
some concrete proposals to indi-
vidual halls committees before
the end of term. But, before im-
plementation, any such proposals
will have to be approved by the
Halls of Residence Committee.

SOUTHSIDE SUNNERS
On Tuesday, 25th May, there
was a fracas at the back of the
Sou*h Side Halls of Residence.
Several young ladies were sun-
ning themselves on the roof of a
mews house, when they became
the centre of attention of certain
gentlemen resident in Tizard
Hall.
Using a battery of loud-
speakers attached to the Radio
Tizard Network, the girls were
inv'.'d across to South Side. The
onlv one fool enough to accept
this invitation was last seen enter-
ing a South Side lavatory, osten-
sibly to drink a cup of coffee.
For some unknown reason,
water was thrown from the Hall
windows, which appears to have
dows, which appears to have
same time, four drunk men
emerged from the mews, shout-
ing obscenities up to the Tizard
residents.
A woman also emerged from
the mews—to complain that the
noise had woken her baby. In
consequence, Mr. Stephensen
was informed, and was going to
investiaate the whole incident.

Selected by Chris Lampard
I.U.S. Blackball Israel
The International Union of
Students, so eloquent in their
fight against racial discrimination
and prejudice, have once again
turned down the National Union
of Israeli students application
for membership.
All other applicants were ac-
cepted but, due to fierce Arab,
Chinese and Soviet opposition,
Israel was refused membership.
The application was part of an
attempt, backed by the National
Union of French students, to
break the Sino-Soviet domination
of I.U.S.

Rag Suspicions
The Rag president at Sunder-
land Tech. was asked fo " help
the police in their enquiries
when it was announced that the
rag week had raised £3,500—the
same amount as was stolen from
a local bank and five times more
than the p 3vious rag had raised.
The Prerident had been seen
driving round the block near the
bank which was robbed. His
suspicious actions were explained
by the fact that he was waiting
for a friend in a no-parking area
and thus could not stop his car.

Q.M.C.. Students Assaulted
At the end of last term two
Q.M.C. students were violently
attacked by a gang of thugs at
Leytonstone Station. They were
grabbed, thrown down some
stairs and beaten up for several
minutes. The attack was unpro-
voked and both victims were
taken to hospital for treatment
for head injuries.
One of the assailants was
trapped in a tube train by a guard
who had witnessed the incident
and was subsequently taken into
custody by the police.

Chain Letters at London College
There has been an outbreak of
chain letters at Q.M.C. and U.C.
These letters promise £729 for
an initial outlay of £2, but a close
mathematical analysis of the pro-
position showns that for, say, 16
people to complete the process,
over 43 million people must par-
ticipate !
The present chain is believed
to have started at Emmanuel Col-
lege, Cambridge.

South African Students Condemn
East Germany
The National Union of South
African students has passed a
resolution on East Germany stat-
ing, among other things: that the
government violates the demo-
cratic and constitutionally guar-
anteed rights of the citizens in
order to control all this ; that the
regime has subordinated all
aspects of education to the fur-
therance of a totalitarian ideo-
logy ; that the regime denies
people the right of self-deter-
mination and that the regime ex-
pects all professors and students
to follow the official ideology.
In the tracks
of Lawrence
It is hoped that in summdr
1966 an I.C. expedition will re-
trace Lawrence's travels across
the Arabian desert. To travel the
whole distance by camel as Law-
rence did, would take several
months, but by using a Landrover
it will be possible to both cover
the 1,200 route and have time to
do useful scientific work.
The most promising field is
geophysics, but there should also
be scope for botany and zoology.
Anybody interested in these de-
partments or who professes to
be a Landrover mechanic or
Saudi Arabian/Jordanian na-
tional, please contact me as soon
as possible via Phys.-dept. or
BAY 5400 evenings.
