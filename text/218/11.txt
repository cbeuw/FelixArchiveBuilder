FELIX II
Lawn Tennis
Rowing
Regatta
The L C . 1st VIII won the
Allom Cup for open VIIIs in the
U.L. Summer VIIIs Regatta for
the third year running on Satur-
day, 15th May, and followed this
up on Saturday, 22nd May, by
winning Junior-Senior VIIIs at
Wallingford Regatta.
In between these two events
the crew lost in the final of the
Vesta Dashes by 3ft. to London
R.C. This record accumulated
after a shaky beginning to the
term, marred by illness and a
period without any coaching, is
an indication of the potential of
the VIII being realised. Wail-
ingford Regatta marked the first
win by an I.C. first VIII in an
open regatta for four years ; in
this event the crew lowered the
previous best time by 27 sees
from 5 min. 11 sec. to 4 m. 44
sees.
Second Eight
Successes
The second VIII have also
been rowing well, and, in fact, got
off to a faster start than the 1st
VIII, having reached the final
of Junior-Senior VIIFs at Putney
regatta, winning at Twickenham
regatta and performing quite
creditably at Thames Ditton and
in the Vesta Dashes.
The third VIII as yet have no
silverware to show but under the
astute care of Tony Blench they
are improving steadily and are
expected to win in the near
future. The 4th VIII novices at
the beginning of the session
rowed very well to win the novice
VIII's division of the U.L. Sum-
mer VIII's regatta.
Chess Club
Promotion won
in London
League
The College Chess teams have
had their most successful season
ever. The highlight of the sea-
son was the winning of Division
II of the London Chess League,
thus gaining promotion to Divi-
sion I . The London League Di-
vision I is the strongest in the
country, with a high proportion
of Britain's leading players tak-
ing part. As the College was
only promoted from Division III
three years ago, it makes the
achievement all the more note-
worthy. The final record was
P.9, W.6, D.2, L . l .
As usual the College won Di-
vision I and II of the University
Leagues, both teams winning all
Triumphs
In the next few weeks the Boat
Club will be represented at Wal-
ton, Brent, Reading, Marlow and
Henley regattas, and the crew
will be training five days a week
—a degree of participation which
is not exceeded by any other
sport in the college. The average
student having reverted to an
exam conscious, brown bagger,
may think that this is academic
•suicide, but results prove other-
wise, in fact they indicate that
relaxation and exercise improve
upon the students working effi-
ciency during working hours.
their matches. The 1st team de-
feated their closest rivals Univer-
sity College — 1 | in the final
match of the season. At the end
of season, Imperial College
played the Rest of London Uni-
versity over 20 boards, and the
probable result is a 10—10 draw,
two games have gone to an adju-
dicator for a decision.
The Club was aided towards
the latter end of the season by
the Italian Chessmaster S
Bouzzie who came to the College
after Christmas.
Special mention must be given
to J. Pearce who had an out-
standing record going through the
season undefeated. A. Whitbread
won the I.C. Individual Cham-
pionship. Team spirit has been
kept high by the energetic presi-
de::! K . P. Neat.
I.C. Ixiwn Tennis Club which
has always had a reputation for
being one of the best college clubs
in London is, if anything, even
better this year.
The 1st V I has so far played
8 matches, won 6, drawn 1, lost 1.
Of five matches played, so far
this season, the 2nd V I has won
4, lost 1, and drawn 1.
In the U.L.U. Cup, which I.C.
won last year, the 1st team has
already won the 1st round against
Q.E.C., and prospects for retain-
ing the cup are excellent.
In the 1st team, Mike Fitz-
gerald (Durham) and Keith Long
(Gloucestershire) have been out-
standing amongst very good com-
pany.
Rifle at Bhley
In the Pafford Cup .303 riflle
match, held at Bisley in glorious
weather on 12th May, I.C. " A "
team were second to Battersea.
This is I.C.s highest position in an
inter-college match, for many
years.
I.C. " B," contrary to the tradi-
tion of beating the " A " team
were 14th and last. In defence
of this low position it should be
stated that the team used a hired
rifle, the bolt of which tended to
come open every time a shot was
fired. It appeared that the bolt
would eventually embed itself
violently into the firer's cheek.
This imposed a certain psycho-
logical disadvantage.

Club in
Ambitious
Form
Fitzgerald, with his fast serve
and accurate touch play, and
Long's excellent volleying, backed
up by C. Sones' power forehand
have shown themselves to be real
assets to the team.
This year the Club proposes to
make the most ambitious summer
tour ever, by playing a club cir-
cuit in the South of France. It
has been impossible to pick the
six best players from the top
eight, so high has been the stan-
dard this year, and consequently
the Captain has selected all eight
to allow for sunstroke victims.

Hockey
Out of Season
There is a growing interest
in playing mid-week hockey
matdhes during the summer. Tlie
College club is especially lucky in
Ixaving a pitch always available
and could have a full fixture list
were there no exams. This is the
third year that I.C. has played
summer games and on on Tues-
day, 18th May, played the first
match this term, versus the
ELIZABETHANS. The pitch at
Harlington was in very good con-
dition despite recent rain and the
game was played at a fast pace,
the final result being 2—1 to the
visitors. I.C.'s goal was scored
by the inside left Mackenzie,
whose reverse stick shot was just
inside the post. This was unfor-
tunately the visiting goalkeeper's
sole mistake, he made several
good saves from Hough and
Stenning, in the last quarter of
the match. It was, in any case
no disgrace to lose so narrowly
to a side containing a present
Welsh international and 2 county
players.

Value for Money?
An average year. Only three sports clubs have produced a
standard of performance expected of a college of this size. The
Badminton, Hockey and Judo clubs have swept all before them and
congratulations must go to them, both for their performances and
the excellent reports for Felix. The output of outstanding individuals
is correspondingly low. Leon Hall now high-jumping 6ft. lin.
recently won the high-jump for London University against A.A.A.
(admittedly Gordon Miller was not competing). Stapely of the I.C.
and B.U.S.F. Water Polo teams is also of potential international
class. The Lawn Tennis Club is also now emerging as a force to
reckon with—containing two County players Fitzgerald and Long.
What has happened to the " big three "—Soccer, Rugby and
Boats ? The former has won so much for so long that it will not,
perhaps, do the club any harm to have something to fight for. How-
ever, the chances of obtaining another player with the ability of
Basil James seem to get less every year. The Rugby Club has done
quite well and was a little unlucky in the U..L. Cup competition, but
there now exists the nucleus for a really great team, for which much
of the credit must go to Havard and Turner.
The Boat Club has not been particularly inspiring for the last
couple of years, but now seems to be showing promising signs.
Of the rest, only Fives shows any indication of life. To Felix
and hence the College in general the Fencing, Squash, Cricket, Sailing,
Volley-ball and Women's Sports Clubs are virtually non-existent.
The Chairman of ACC only hears from the Volley-ball Club when
financial assistance is required.
Although (as Mr. Jenkins would say) we are not a profit-making
institution we ought to be getting more returns for the £4,500 injected
annually into the ACC clubs.
