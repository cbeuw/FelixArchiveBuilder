BUCHANAN TO PLAN
THE RAILWAYS
Professor C. D. Buchanan has
accepted the invitation to be
President of the Railway Society
for the forthcoming year. This
was one of the highlights men-
tioned by the Chairman in his
annual report given at the An-
nual Dinner on May 13th.
Due to a wide range of inter-
esting activities the Society has
achieved a much increased mem-
bership. The Train Driving outing
on May 2nd was mainly respon-
sible for this.
Among the Society's other
notable achievements this year
have been a visit to the Gloucester
area—never before had the
Society ventured out as fa< as
Ross-on-Wye on a single day's
visit
The Society's 3}" gauge loco-
motive " Dymphna " surpassed
itself by covering 71 laps of the
track of the Harlington Loco-
motive Society's track—it had
only previously performed a mere
4 circuits. Recently the boiler was
tested—to reassure the faint
hearted? And now the locomotive
is resplendent in a coat of maroon

New Club
To Help
Youth
The summer term may not,
from a numerical standpoint, be
the ideal time for starting a new
society. The I.C. Youth Council
has had what might be termed a
cautious start to its life, only nine
attending its inauguration. How-
ever, this does not I feel repre-
sent the true feelings of I.C.
students on the topic of Youth
Work.
Well, why a Youth Council?
Since it will have close contact
with the voluntary youth organis-
ations in London, it can help here
by offering a full range of club
work. The Youth Council will
hold regular meetings and
through the U.L.U. Youth Coun-
cil provide short training courses
for those wishing to enter this
field of social service.
Briefly, above are some of the
reasons why I.C. should have a
Youth Council all that is now
required is your help. So, if you
intend to be around college next
year, and the idea of a Youth
Council appeals to you, write to
Phil Henser (Elec. Eng. 2 or via
Union Rack).

JAZZ CLUB
- B U S Y
PLANNING
The Jazz Club, far from being
struck by the summer apathy ex-
perienced in most clubs, is now
busy planning its activities for
next year. These will include
record recitals and talks on pro-
minent jazz personalities, jazz
evenings and concerts featuring
professional jazz groups, and, of
course, midweek jazz stomps.
Membership of the club will
again be open to non-musicians,
and generous reductions will be
available to members at all meet-
ings.
One of the biggest problems
every year in the jazz club is the
shortage of musicians—specific
musicians. In common with the
rest of Britain we are at present
very short of rhythm sections, i.e.
pianists, bass players, and drum-
mers. If you play one of these
instruments, but have been hiding
modestly, now is the time to ap-
pear (or early next term). The
present strength and success of the
Jazz Club depends on its
musicians. Whether we can main-
tain or improve our standing may
depend on you.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
