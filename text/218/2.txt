SOLVED IN THE BAR
"The Kashmir problem between India and Pakistan would be
solved in the bar of the Imperial College Union." So claimed the
Chairman of the Indian Society at their Annual Dinner on 17th May,
but it remains to be seen whether this remark will gain as much fame
as that about the Battle of Waterloo.
The distinguished guests in-
cluded the Indian High Commis-
sioner, Dr. Jivraj Mehta, and
Mrs. Mehta, Sir Patrick and
Lady Linstead ,and several I.C.
Professors.
The dinner, consisting almost
entirely of Indian dishes, was
enjoyed by all and followed by
reasonably short and interesting
speeches. Both Dr. Mehta and
Sir Patrick stressed the necessity
for Indian students to return
home and serve their country
after acquiring higher educa-
tion or training abroad.

A Success for Exec.
Riverboat Rave
by Barry Mair.
On the evening of Wednesday, 19th May, Westminster Pier saw
the arrival oE a motley crowd of 150 people all raving to go on a
"Riverboat Rave.' Much advanced speculation had been made
about this event with ticket prices crashing from 25/- to 5/- per double
on " Wall Street," I.C.
There was then a quick run on English currency and the week
ended with a £60 deficit to the union. The executive of the union
had agreed to treat this as a poor man's May Ball, and proved it by
turning UD in force. „. . , , ,
The boat drew away late at
7.45 p.m. and proceeded down-
stream towards Radio London at
a frightening speed, being passed
only by driftwood and Prices
empty beer cans. The Jazz-band
was of a very high standard and
invoked people to dance of sexual
symbolism at sporadic intervals.
At quarter to nine the whistle
went for half time when the band
and the boats changed ends. The
captain disappeared to the bar on
hearing that West Ham had
scored a second goal, leaving the
boat in the incapable hands of
President Price's girlfriend.
BAND VANISHED
At this juncture the band
vanished downstairs to avoid fly-
ing glasses projected from the
riverside pubs. A few people re-
mained on the top deck to absorb
and filter the cool night air, while
the rest sat or danced in the lower
lounge in an atmosphere of un-
restrained chatter.
As a side show, Ian Craig and
Pete Metcalfe took on all comers
at a beer-can-bending competition
and accompanied the band with
the remains. Thus the boat ar-
rived at the pier with everybody
completely satisfied with their 5/-s
worth and I am sure they would
like me to give a vote of thanks to
Phil Dean and his crew for their
efforts.

NEW PHOENIX MAKES FOR
DIFFICULT READING
by A. J. OXLEY
Surely the purpose of writing is to communicate, not to impress
the reader with the lone words the writer knows. The written word
can be entertaining and informative if it is comprehensible.
It would be unfair to say that
Phoenix was totally incomprehen-
sible to me (a simple Engineer),
but Carol Thompson seemed to
be justifying her position as Edi-
tor by using long words, and very
complex meaningless sentences.
I would like to be able to write
a criticism to compare with Joan
Lakin's book review, but I got no
inspiration from Mr. Macauley's
effort which I found unreadable.
But to be fair, the stories (with
the exception of Christopher
Dean's) were good, Mervyn Jones
deserved his three guineas prize,
but the story Waterways had too
much background and not
enough story for my liking.
OLD SUBJECT
The articles were a very mixed
bunch, " A Sunburnt Country "
is a good treatment, even if a bit
slow, of an old subject, the hot
Australian Christmas. " More a
way of life " and "Silwood Park"
were sensible and informative.
The essay about White Corpus-
cles would have gained my ever-
lasting admiration if it had been
written by an " O " level candi-
date, however, jt must have been
an interesting exercise for John
Forbes.
'' What advice do Students
get?" was a proof to me of the
uselessness of questionnaires and.
masses of figures. The only way
to present figures is in tabular or
graphical form.
The most impressive pages
were R. M. Henson's photographs
which were excellent, n is pain-
fully obvious that it was not the
Felix printer whom printed Phoe-
nix, Felix could never reproduce
such photographs so satisfac-
torily.
