Operatic Society: The Mikado
T H E I R R E S T I B L E music of Arthur
Sullivan and the precocious libretto of
W.S. Gilbert rose to grand heights last
Saturday when the Operatic Society per-
formed "The Mikado". What a stunner of a
production! In truly theatrical last-night
tradition, the ad-libs and encores were
rife with marvellous effect. Imagine cheer-
ing for an encore of the Mikado's song and
receiving a superbly «poof version which
surprised not only the audience, but the
orchestra (who understandably muffed a
few notes at the time) and the conductor
a s well to whom some of thelyrics were
jokingly directed:
"The imperfect conductor whom anyone
catches, unable to keep strict time,
He's made to stand with a second - rate
band, conducting this tedious rhyme.
This barbarons bunch of part-time play-
ers, to watching the beat they're
immune.
How can he get better at light operetta,
when the violins can't play in tune?"
(These lyrics, incidentally, were written
only five minutes before they were sung
on stage) .
A s Yum-Yum, Pat Elliot clearly starred,
Her voice was clear and brilliant without
being s h r i l l . Lin Davis was magnificent
a s the Mikado, his presence on the stage
being felt immediately. H i s outrageous en-
core brought the house down. Brian Pars-
ons a s N a n k i - P o o and Peter Mills a s K o -
Ko shone confidently with Tim Johnson
(Pish-Tush) and Sue Cochran (Katisha) in
fine support. Roger Woodward as Pooh-
Bah was a neat piece of c a s t i n g . The
subtle pathos injected into this role had
the audience in fits of laughter.
Mention must a l s o be made of Debbie
Kemp (Pitt -Sing) and Jane Stanford
(Peep-Bo), who, when they teamed up
w i t h Pat Elliot for "Three Little Maids",
showed us what v o c a l training i s a l l
about.
Producer Ian Gledhi II conductor David
Pollard and O p s o c Chairman Steve Thur-
low are entitled to be w e l l pleased with
this year's production.

Ben Webster: Ballads by Ben Webster
(Verve 2683.049)
To a few great jazz m u s i c i a n s , the
advance of years signifies a deepening of
their powers. Stan Getz is one of these,
so is Stephane Grappelli and supremely
perhaps, was the late Ben Webster. H e
seems to have had two careers, the first
centered upon his time with the E l l i n g t o n
band in the 1940's and the second a s a
s o l o i s t from the mid-fifties onwards. The
tunes compiled for this double- album are,
a s the title signifies a l l ballads (the field
of jazz where one feels Webster was a l -
ways most suited) taken from this second
period
The sound of Webster's saxophone -
the quality of tone, depth of improvisional
s k i l l s - but above a l l , his great romantic-
ism, gives his ballad style a uniqueness
that shone through on almost everthing he
did .Some of the best examples are to be
found on this record, among them, 'My
funny Valentine' 'Chelsea Bridge' and
'Prelude to a kiss.' A fine album for
people who appreciate j a z z , in particular
Ben Webster's approach to i t .

A Foot in Cold Water: Or All Around
Us. (Elektra).
A n enterprising fellow indeed must •
have conjured up this s t y l i s h name, I
mean Canadians might have thought twice
about a band c a l l e d " D e e p Uriah Sab»
b a t h " , or something.
The opener's a mini - k i l l e r , a sort of
"Honky-Tonk Women" a la Burlesque,
e n t i t l e d " / know what you need." T h e
s t r i k i n g feature i s that for a relatively
new outfit the sound is tight, and the
production suits their loud, brash style
The playing is good, and obviously
goes back a fair way, but the vocals
stamp a heavy metal seal on the music,
to its detriment, a s A l e x Machin screeches
out the lyrics a l l o w i n g little scope for
contrast or variety, and after a few tracks
the monotony begins to set i n .
Of the group the most talented appears
to be guitarist P a u l Naumann, who
provides the more inventive moments to
this competently played and s e l f - p e n n e d
set of numbers. The others seem to be
embedded in a format of turning out
repetitive lyrics to a barrage of m u s i c - t o -
bash - y o u r - h e a d -against - the-floorboards
-to.
T o be fair though, the music is inter-
esting, and this album, with the right
exposure, could do well with followers of
Uriah Heep or B l a c k Sabbath. It is loud
and heavy, and it k i c k s : s o it i s worth a
listen. Not the stuff of legend, but in the
absence of Mr Machin they could w e l l put
out something s p e c i a l .
P a u l E k p e n y o n g
Oscar Peterson, Lionel Hampton,
Buddy Rich and Ray Brown: The Jazz
Ambassadors (verve).
AS Y O U would expect from the title the
musicians on this album would be of the
highest c a l i b r e . Certainly L i o n e l Hampton
(vibraphones), Oscare Peterson (piano),
Ray Brown (bass) and Briddy R i c h (drums)
are geniuses in each of their fields.
The music on this album was recorded
on three separate o c c a s i o n s between Sept-
ember 1953 and September 1954 and though
the recording is in mono this does not de-
tract from the music.
The album k i c k s off with 'This can't be
love' with an easy going swing beat to it
and there follows 'Midnight Sun' which i s
s i m i l a r in s t y l e . ' L o v e for sale' and
'Stompin' at the Savoy' side two are superb
p i e c e s .
In the former Ray Brown performs a bass
solo of exquisiteness while in the latter we
are treated to a sample of the amazing tal-
ents of L i o n e l Hampton on v i b e s .
The next song 'Stardust' i s of a slower
tempo with piano dominating . T h i s song
really marks the quality of music which I
s h a l l leave you to discover for yourselves.
The second record (it's a two record set)
begins with 'Just one of those things' with
the c r i s p , im.maculate drumming of Buddy
R i c h , a c l a s s i c piece. 'April in Paris' i s
something you've just got to experience.
A g a i n a s indeed throughout the album L i o n -
el Hampton's playing (this time on xylop-
hone^ has to be admired and in fact he i s
the dominating influence throughout.
If youare a jazz fan and enjoy the kind
of music these guys play, then this album
has just got to be your next purchase.

Richie Havens: Mixed Bay
(Polydor 2310 356)
IN keeping with his previous albums
this album contains mainly tracks written
by other artists .In this case there is a
wider variety, ranging from P a u l McCart-
neys "Band On the Run" to N e i l Young's
"The Loner" and B o b D y l a n s "Sad Eyed
Lady" to Wandering Angus" a poem by
Y e a t s set to m u s i c . T h i s does not imply
that he tries to copy other people, the re-
verse is definitely true - Havens is uniq-
ue . H i s incredible voice is s o deep that at
times he sounds more like an urld grizzly
growling .Unfortunately his instrumental
ability lacks the uniqueness of his vocals
and he has to rely on a competent band of
musicians to drown out his repetitive
strumming .
R i c h i e H a v e n s has a very positive
philosophy on life yet chooses not to ex-p
press his thoughts to any great length in
song, indeed he wrote only one of the
tracks on the a l b u m . The first track "Ooh
Child" by Stan Vincent i s very much in
keeping with his philosophy this the story
of a father telling his son of the brighter
days ahead, in which R i c h i e s ' deep v o i c e
can be heard at its most melodic. The only
track in which he does express himself i s
"Someone Suite" aptly named a s it tells
us we a l l must have some one to turn t o .
It makes me wonder why he has to rely on
other people's work when he can write
such meaningful words himself. "Band on
