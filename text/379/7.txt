FELIX 7
S w i m m i n g
Gala
T H E A N N U A L Swimming G a l a took place last Tuesday with
victory going to Mines . G u i l d s who battled hard finished second
with R C S t r a i l i n g in third and last position.
The outstanding feature of the gala was the water-polo com-
petition which saw the staff team e x c e l l i n g with a fine display
.of s k i l l and showmanship
..which totally overwhelmed the
opposition .Amongst the C C U
teams the G u i l d s men were
most adaptable to water and
their event was indeed credit-
able .
The most amusing event, as
might be expected, was the
novelty race, T h i s consisted of
two lengths of the swimming
bath, on the first leg each com-
petitor carried an inflated bal-
loon (not tied-up which had to
be kept inflated until the chan-
ge over. On the return lap the
competitors had to.aarry a
small lighted candle on a tin
tray back with them.
The president's race was
the non-event of the evening
with Trev, Pete, Jenny and
Ron linking arms and not get-
ting very far. John Mortimer
and J u l i a n Tyson had a very
good race which J u l i a n won by
a hairs breadth .
Mr Mortimer collected the
s h i e l d on behalf of Mines and
led off with the Miners song.
G u i l d s collected the three han-
dled pot and it was then a
question of who could get to
the beer first!

R u p e r t H a r p e r
T I M E H A S come round aga-
in for my ego trip in print, but
this time I am a s k i n g for your
support so that I can carry on
being secretary of the section
next year and be able to make
a better job of what I set out
to do last year. T h e things
that I would like to see are a
good workshop and somewhere
to keep the bikes where they
should be safe, a l s o the hire
Bantam project, which is in the
hands of Dave Salisbury of the
Bent Bonnie fame, have you
ever noticed how nobody parks
outside Southside any more?
Santa Pod has got nothing on
P r i n c e s Gardens.
Progress with the Bantams
i s at the moment grinding thr-
ough the wheels of bureaucracy
A l s o I feel that the section
needs to be a meeting point for
Motorcyclists in the College;
there is nothing to stop non-
members coming to the meet-
ings in fact they would be w e l -
come..
Some bloke has nicked N i c k
Fodens C r a s h helmet. It is a
white Kangol Gladiator F u l l -
face effort and it was taken
from the Southside, refectory
one lunchtime. Apart from not
being able to ride his bike un-
til he gets another, it w i l l cost
a lot to replace, and what is
more, other peoples crash hats
provide no protection because
the shape on the inside is
wrong, so if you have it hand
it in to the messenger In the
southside main entrance or to
Don in the Keogh entrance and
no questions w i l l be asked,but
God help you if you are seen
wearing it around the college,
because you wi 1
1 need more
than just a crash hat when we
catch y o u . So s a v e yourself a
lot of bother and hand it i n , the
messengers w i l l not know that
it is stolen, so there w i l l be no
questions, promise.
