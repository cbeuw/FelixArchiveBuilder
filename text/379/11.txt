the Run" starts off sounding full of pro-
mise and the first verse is thoroughly en-
joyable bu by the time he has repeated it

The album is. well produced, the style

perhaps the content i s not up to his best.

Nothing But A Heartache
K E N J I L S A W A D A i s supposed to be the
biggest thing in Japanese Pop, and i s
about to spring on an unsuspecting Brit-
ish audience. .The song itself is very
westernised,' although there remains a
slight oriental flavour in the music .
The music i s very pleasant, although
personally I feel perhaps its too good to
make the c h a r t s . The f Upside is just an
unimpressive rehash of an old standard.

Everything That Rises Must C o n v e r g e
Don't be put off by the title, which
in my opinion i s far too clumsy for such
a w e l l written book, and has the added
disadvantage of sounding like a line
from a Leonard Cohen song. The author,
who died in 1964 at the early age of
thirty-eight, was a woman who spent
most of her life in Georgia, and this
book i s a c o l l e c t i o n of short stories
about the people who inhabit the Deep
South of A m e r i c a . She speaks with the
quiet authority of one who has absorbed
the quintessential aspects of her unique
environment; and in thse nine apologues
she has s u c c e s s f u l l y combined a con-
siderable talent for writing with an obv-
ious, probably inherent,flair for psycho-
logy. Often an element of humour creeps
into the stories, particularly in her des-
criptions, but in no way are these used
to gloss over the hard facts; the society
she describes i s not an easy one to live
i n . Many of the people are failures,
w h i l e in some c a s e s the more worldly
successful figures are shown to be both
s h a l l o w and unforgivably complacent.
The only other American writer I know
of who can portray this particular s p e c -
ies of working people with such pers-
picuity and honest accurateness i s John
Steinbeck, e s p e c i a l l y in The Grapes of
Wrath; anyone who enjoys h i s work w i l l
find much of interest here.Whether M i s s
O'Connor would have matured into as
great a writer as he is a pyhothetcal,
though interesting question. There isn't
much of her work about, and she won't
be writing any more, s o get hold of a
copy and read it before she either drops
into obscurity or acquires a cult follow-
i n g .
CROSS COUNTRY
There was a distinct sense of deja vue l a s t Wednesday when
the 4th London C o l l e g e s League race was h e l d at Parliament H i l l
F i e l d s only four days after the Southern Championships had been
held there. H a d we really gone home that Saturday night after the
championships or had we been running around through the mud
continuously during the inter-
vening period? I'm not sure,
but the terrain certainly seem
ed quite familiar.
T o add insult to injury the
elements decided the course
wasn't muddy enough and five
minutes before the start the
heavens opened and produced
a downpour.
Ian F.llis made his usual
sprint for the front at the
start of the race, followed by
the usual progressive fade,
but kept going a l i t t l e longer
After our enforced midweek lay off the hockey club returned to
the fray l a s t Saturday with a league match against Kodak. The
day started in fine style for IC when skipper T i m (a stitch in
time) Hanson won the toss and after a great deal of thought elect-
ed to play towards the end which sported a l l the surface water.
A s usual, IC attacked straight
from the bully off, but most of
the attacks broke down due to
the varying pace of the ball
through the wet patches.on the
p i t c h . Although I C left huge
gaps in midfield the defence
coped admirably with any
attack Kodak c o u l d offer. How-
ever, with only five minutes to
go to half time slack marking
allowed a Kodak forward a bit
of space and he promptly slam-
med the ball into the goal.
H a l f time arrived with Kodak
leading 1 - 0. Inspired by our
dynamic captain's half time
talk and also by the fact that
the forwards were attacking the
drier end of the pitch I C started
the second half in fine style.
With both defence and midfield
under total control the forwards
looked much more menacing and
goals seemed sure to come.
The first came from a right
wing cross which beat the
whole Kodak defence . A b r i l l -
iant run from left wing John
Latter put him in the right spot
and he only had to tap the b a l l
home. A second goal soon fol-
l o w e d . T h e events leading up
to this goal were a bit confus-
ed .However after a lew min-
utes argument " S l e e p y " B a s h -
ar awarded a penalty f l i c k . A s
the Kodak goalkeeper dived out
of the way K i m Houlden flicked
the ball over thim into the goal.
Our third goal came when, on
intercepting a hurried Kodak
clearance, " J u l i e " put " H o t -
s h o t " L o r d away down the right
wing. The resulting cross was
drilled into the goal by a div-
ing Bob Middleton. T h i s goal
was a just reward for Bob who-
se tremendous efforts had done
much in bringing about I C ' s
second half revival (watch out
Mister T a squared). Although
Kodak did score again before
the end I C deservedly won 3 -
2. T h i s was an excellent over-
a l l team performance with no-
one playing a bad game .
Team:- Roger Hutson; Jim Mar-
shall; Mike Vieyra; P J'Ace;
Welsh Wizard; Stitch (capt);
Hotshot, Julie; Bob Middleton;,
Ian McLean; John Latter;
Ump:- Sleepy
this time and wasn't p a s s e d
by Rob or Steve until after a
mile and a h a l f . R o b A l l i n s o n
feeling good after his rest in
the Southern's boy's race <
powered through to finish a
very respectable 4th in 29.36,
followed by Steve Webb in 13
th place in 30.36. T h i s rather
early arrival by Steve caused
ex-crosscountry c l u b drinking
(?) star Ian Isherwood to drop
the d i s c s he was handing out
to the f i n i s h e r s , P a u l C l a r k e
gave lan F.lli s a tun. for h i s
money but Ian just about
came out on top finishing 20th
(he might get his name in A .
W. this time) with P a u l two
p l a c e s behind, with times of
31.06 and 31.13 â€¢ respectively.
T h e big surprise of the day
then occured when Dave Hou-
lbrooke c l o s e d the scoring for
the l s t team, obviously h a v -
i n g overcome, the drive shaft
trouble that had caused h i s
premature exit from the South-
e m s . He ploughed i n respect-
able 30th in 31.55. Dave
Jones was the spacer at 39.
2nd team: A If Garnett 47th;
N.Boag 14th; R Harrington
60th; I) J'ayne 74th; M.W'el-
ford 78th.
3rd team: A.Davey 80th; Pad
Donnelly 88th; A .Fairhead
91 st; Bob Ignaciuk Wist.
B o b Igiaciuk had the dubious
pleasure of being last (again!)
The 1 st team are now 2nd
to Barts H o s p i t a l in D i v i s i o n
1 and only 13 points behind
them. With a full l s t team in
the l a s t league race we shou-
l d beat them quite easily and
also hold off the expected
late challenge from Borough
Road C o l l e g e to win the l s t
d i v i s i o n for the first time in
at least 5 years (thats as long
as I c a n remember!)
The 2nd team and the 3rd
team are l s t and 2nd in Div-
ision 2 and look certain can-
didates for promotion - we
only hope that they don't get
relegated next year!
On Saturday we competed
in a race that has now become
a regular fix for the c l u b .
L o n d o n ' s " C h a m p i o n o f cham-
p i o n s " road race, the H i l l i n g -
don ' 5 ' . It's a pity that the
changing f a c i l i t i e s do not
match up to the standard of
the race - 200 athletes a l l try-
ing to use two loos before the
race and two tin baths after
the race i s just not on! How-
ever the race i s o f sufficient
quality to make up for the
lack of f a c i l i t i e s to a certain
extent,
The course i s one lap o f
5 miles around the roads o f
H i l l i n g d o n and R u i s l i p , spec-
i a l l y constructed to frustrate
motorists and Saturday after-
noon shoppers . B o b Holt of
H e r c u l e s Wimbledon l e d the
field home in a time of 23.45
in front o f a bunch o f runners
that included P a u l C l a r k e ' s
sprinting partner Julian Goat-
er of Oxford. Apparently there
was a bit of a bundle up the
front and Julian Goater came
off worst but unfortunately
the author was not up with
leaders at that point and so
no further information i s ava-
i l a b l e .
Rob A l l i n s o n led the I C
team i n (again) with a great
run o f 25.39 f i n i s h i n g in 34th
p l a c e . Next was Steve Webb
in 63rd eventually beating h i s
30 minute bogey with.a time
of 27.01. P a u l C l a r k e was 80
th in 27.39 and Dave Jones,
reaching peak form just in
time for the Hyde P a r k Relay,
finished the scoring for the
l s t team in 90th position in a
time o f 28.04. The captain,
suffering from a heavy c o l d
didn't make the l s t team (un-
lucky Ian) but finished a 96th
in a respectable time of 28.22.
Two other IC runners managed
to break the s i x minute m i l i n g
barrier, namely A l f Gamett
121st, 29.29 and R i c h Harrin-
gton 130th in 29 SI. Amone
the a l s o rans were N e i l B o a g
139 in 39.16, Dave H o u l -
brooke, having tractor trouble
again, 145 in 30.47, John
Shearer 157 31.39 and B o b
Ignaciuk 183 3 5 . 5 2 . I ' m happy
to report that B o b was not
last, but actually beat 15 oth-
ers! Keep up the training B o b
and y o u ' l l soon b e i n the l s t
team!
