6 FELIX
: Brendan Clements
by R i z S h a k i r
T H E UNION B a r ' s Manager i s a
one c a n have an enjoyable chat
to be appreciated.
Brendan w a s bom i n Dublin
where he spent h i s youth a n d
took h i s A - l e v e l s . After work-
ing in the customs and e x c i s e
for nine months, he left for
L o n d o n .
H e worked in a pub for t w o
w e e k s after which he got a job
i n the Union Bar w h i l e looking
for something e l s e . However,
he stayed on and w a s
subsequently offered the job of
running toe bar, which h e
accepted. Now he likes the
j o b , the people he works w i t h ,
and he s a y s "after working
here for six and a half years,
It has become part of my life".
I asked him what d i d
Ms job entail; the answer came,
"/ work bloody hard for a start -
Oft and feel that part of my job
Is to make the bar as good a
place to come to as possible
besides the usual buying and
selling etc. It is not a nine -
to-five job (although the basic
week fs forty hours) because
n amicable character with whom
or exchange a joke which i s sure
part of the job is to cover for
people If they are sick. If I
have to work sixty hours, then
I have to work sixty hours;
there is no way of getting out
of it".
He enjoys going to dinners
because "It gives me a chance
to meet people and see the
other side of a person". Then
he jokingly adds "and it's a
lot cheaper than going outside".
H e admits that a student
environment must have some
effects on married life but in the
same breath he adds that none
of these are in any way adverse.
T h e only snag of the job i s the
long hours that he has to work
but he thinks that this could
happen in any trade.
Upon my inquiry about the
way in which the bar has
changed over the years, he
replied that the bar used to be
"cliquish", whereas now
various colleges organise bar
nights etc and it allows students
to meet other students with
s i m i l a r interests. He believes
that the Union B a r i s unique in
s o far a s "everybody seems to
know the next person".
Somewhat reluctantly he
agrees that there are some
frustrations in h i s job which he
has to put up with, "for
example, there are times when
I would have liked to have
commented on something, but I
am a College employee". H e
q u i c k l y supplements the above
statement with "but it is not
my job to say such things,
people are elected to do this
and in any case people have
started to consult me over most
of the relevant decisions taken
in recent years".
H i s big interest i s rugby
w h i c h came about a s a direct
result of working In' the b a r .
Before coming to IC he played
G a e l i c Football and basketball
but now he does not get the
time to take an active interest,
although he does say "I'm a
fairly good spectator of any
game".
H e follows the progress of
Irish Rugby with particular
interest because "it i&the only
international sport in-wlflch the
team is chosen from both the
North and the South . I like to
see them do well for that reason.
Life in Mines
B o b F i o n a
Ruminating in the balmy atmosphere of the Mines common room,
surrounded by sennet paper aeroplanes and congealed chocolate,
the assembled intelligencia i s wracking its brain for ideas for
this article when in w a l k s Superminer. Going straight to the head
of the queue for the coffee machine, he turns and s a y s : "Anyone
got tuppence to lend us?" Y e s
f o l k s , its * ? !
scrounge again!
G ) on the
Expectancy
What has this got to do with
an article for F E L I X ? A b s o l u t -
ely nothing, but it does typify
life in RSM at the moment. T h e
low ebb of morale encountered
at the beginning of term i s now
almost back to its most buoy-
ant high, and there is a tremen-
dous a i r of expectancy surroun-
ding a l l .(No, superminer i s not
pregnant!)
Brighton or Calais?
The Union elections are to
be held next month, and apart
from deciding on suitable c a n -
didates for the posts, there i s
a lively d i s c u s s i o n on whether
or not we should risk going
down to Brighton again after
the infamous dealings we had
last year with the High Sheriff
of Sussex. The only other a l -
ternative seems to be a trip
over to C a l a i s to give le fuzz
F r a n c a i s a headache for a
change, though it seems likely
that Brighton w i l l remain the
v e n u e .
Davey bearers tried
The trial of Helen Mattrass,
M i k e K i l b r i d e and the other
Davey bearers has now taken
place, and a s usual in these
t r i a l s , which are extremely fair
and unbiased (the accused are
even allowed counsel for their
defence!), the possible verdicts
ranged from not very guilty thr-
ough guilty and very guilty to
extremely guilty, though only
the latter came seriously into
consideration. T h e Judge, (The
Right Honourable Lord Mortim-
er) w a s in a lenient mood how-
ever, and the penalties award-
ed were not too severe .
Whitewash
Y o u may have noticed that
the Mines building has been
given a good W B U and i s now
once again looking the regally
superb monument it i s . It really
is amazing what a bit of soap
and water can do .(About that
denim suit M a s h . . )
Drummer fooled
Enthusiasm (something C &
G and R C S only read about), i s
In great abundance in Mines a s
can be noted by comparing the
176 at the Engineers D & D
(with Minesmen and O C ' s out-
numbering present Guildsmen)
to the 328 at the Mines B a l l .
We were glad to hear, however,
that the drummer of the band
booked for the D & D event-
ually arrived at College B l o c k
after making a tour of K n i g h t s -
bridge, (courtesy of Supen-
miner.)
Rockdrill rhythms
And now something about
miners . A miner has a natural
advantage over others doing
more conventional courses - he
knows he can readily get a job
(and more often than not, a
w e l l paid one!) on leaving the
the cloistered confines of univ-
ersity. Once you have got your
job, you a l s o have the perk of
free meais underground (if you
are fast enough to catch the
rats and you do not mind b i g ,
juicy cockroaches), though you
have to get your own steak for
a Saturday morning braai. A l s o ,
for between £10 and £25 per
month if you are working in the
right part of the world, you get
full board and lodging. On top
of this, if you train them well
enough the laundry girls w i l l
not use a hot iron to melt your
new nylon shirts, and might
even give you some of your own
clothes back if y o u are l u c k y . .
One of the major advantages of
working underground however,
is that you can get away from
nagging women for a while and
s l e e p off your hangover to the
peaceful rhythm of half a dozen
rockdrills banging away at the
stope face.
Character
Anyway, back to the R S M
where life flows peacefully on,
and the Union pays for you to
go abroad and get paralytic for
a week on a Foreign Students
trip .More emphasis was always
la id .on character rather than
academic brilliance .Some of
you may even remember John
"Batman" Mellors, a t the mom-
ent taking a holiday of conven-
ience from the rigours of R S M .
H i s latest exploit was to figure
prominently in rescue opera-
tions in a flooded mine shaft in
South A f r i c a . Such i s the RSM
s p i r i t .
A bit of news for the more
uninformed F E L I X readers is,
that RSM again wiped the board
with Cambourne. L a s t weekend,
the bottle match was again
fought and won, more convinc-
ingly than the scoreline sug-
gests, and our footballers and
squash players yet again show-
ed their supremancy over the
make - believe miners from
Cornwall . A l l in a l l , a great
weekend well rounded off in
the bar!
And now, to finish, a quote
well known to Minesmen and
some of P h y s i c s III: "If this
machine gives water instead of
chocolate, please fold the no-
tice at the back of this notice
over this notice." L o n g l i v e
RSM and a l l »vho drink in her!
