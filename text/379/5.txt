Sennet Replies
A t the l a s t c o u n c i l meeting the H o n . Sec. reported that s h e had
received a letter from Sennet i n reply to the letter she had written.
Ms Shaw, secretary to the E d i t o r i a l Board writes " ... i t i s our
b e l i e f that your C o u n c i l has been misinformed ... " and then
l i s t s three facts which council should note.
She firstly c l a i m s that while
g i v i n g information to advertis-
ers " ... w e stress our print-
run and not our circulation . . . "
and further states that " I t i s
orthodox practice to estimate
circulation by multiplying print-
run by 2.5 (national papers fo
t h i s ) " . B u t the fact remains
that Sennet i s not a national
newspaper thus a claim for
such a multiplication factor i s
l u d i c i o u s .
Secondly she states " - w e
have a distribution problem at
about 7 c o l l e g e s . T h e differ*
ence they make i s n e g l i g i b l e i'
However the evidence from the
colleges w i l l suggest other-
w i s e .
The third fact she puts for*
ward i s that " - there i s no
evidence to support the c l a i m
that Sennet i s " p o a c h i n g " ,
advertising - " , y e t on two
o c c a s s i o n s i n the recent mon-
ths advertisments which were
to appear i n F E L I X , were
c a n c e l l e d , the reason given be-
i n g that they were n o w appear"
