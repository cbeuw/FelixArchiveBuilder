individual i n a communist
country, do not seem desirable.
However, i n contrast, the
N F proposes the building of a
N a z i - style dictatorship,
wherein, like H i t l e r ' s massacre
of two m i l l i o n J e w s , we would
be encouraged to support
racialism . From the point of
view o f the immigrant to or
emigrant from this country, such
r a c i a l i s t p o l i c i e s are i l l o g i c a l
s i n c e h i s aim (unless he i s an
unfortunate Ugandan A s i a n ) i s
generally to better himself and
hence the country to which he
emigrates. Indeed, people of
any creed particularly those
holding B r i t i s h passports
should have the right to ljjve
peaceably in this country.
However, i t should be made
clear to any immigrant that our
streets are not 'paved with
gold' and that our present
economic climate i s gloomy.
F i n a l l y , for those who are
d i s i l l u s i o n e d with the N F v .
Communist battle in student
p o l i t i c s , who are satisfied with
the level o f the grant, or do not
like marching under communist
- s t y l e banners declaring w e
should bring down one or
another government, I would
emphasise that there are small
p o l i t i c a l societies which
engage , not i n student p o l i t i c s ,
but in the study o f parliamentary
democracy and it i s through
such groups that serious
p o l i t i c a l d i s c u s s i o n can be
achieved. My personal view i s
that my education at I C i s a
privilege not a right, and I am
prepared to work hard towards
a degree to prove that I am
worth spending money on to
educate. That though i s a
personal view and unfortunately
like many other moderates,
p o l i t i c a l l y speaking, my work
leaves me little time to devote
to ending the domination of
student p o l i t i c s b y extreme
elements.

to the mind of Mr P y e .
R . J . H o l l i n g d a l e , A . T i l l e , or
any of the other translators of
"Thus spake Zarathustra"
may preach what they w i s h
but I consider N i e t z s c h e to be
understood only in the con-
text of h i s contemporary
society.
F i r s t and foremost N i e t z -
sche's philosophy i s one that
epitomises a l l the horrors of
the middle c l a s s in Germany,
locked in the war-tom trials
of unification in the latter
half of the l a s t centry: terri-
fied by the emergence of the
working c l a s s as a force for
its destraction in the P a r i s
communes and Marx's agita-
tion (which led to the forma-
tion of the S . D . P .), suffocated
by the feudal power of the
German princes and Emperor,
and l a c k i n g the immense c o l -
onial wealth of France and
B r i t a i n that would enable i t to
buy off and create a labour
aristocracy, thus prolonging
its s u r v i v a l . In other words i f
ever there were a group of
people who felt they were de-
stined to rule and yet frust-
rated - i t was N i e t z s c h e ' s
stratum of German society.
T h i s i s where his ideas of
Man and Superman come from.
L i f e to N i e t z s c h e i s "essent-
ially appropriation, infringe-
ment, the overpowering of the
alien and the weaker, oppres-
sion, hardness, imposition of
one's own form, assimilation
and, at the least and the mild-
est, exploitation ."
H i s ideas on humanity
e a s i l y adapt to H i t l e r ' s Aryan
creed "At the bottom of all
nable races lies unmistakably
the beast of prey, the magnif-
icent blond beast, greedily
prowling after prey and vict-
ory ''.
T h i s outlook put him in
opposition to Bismarck who
he c r i t i c i z e d not for military
excesses but for his craven
servility to the Emperor: " /
shall forgive no one who .
makes a compromise with it"
and "Listen to the barking
commands that virtually en-
circle the German city".
N i e t z s c h e ' s views on rac-
i a l mixing were e a s i l y ignored
by the fanatical anti-commun-
ists of the N a r i s who found
their p o l i t i c s mirrored in his
hatred o f s o c i a l i s m and s o c ;
ial-Democracy .
Thus we see that N i e t z s -
che brought to a high point a l
the fears and aspirations o f
the middle c l a s s in Germany
who were to form the back-
bone o f H i t l e r ' s movement
some sixty years later and
that i s why his works were
made obligatory reading by
the N a t i o n a l S o c i a l i s t s .
Today his philosophy i s
mirrored in the poetic works
of Enoch P o w e l l - "I hate the
weak, I hate the lame, etc ."
and tomorrow perhaps his
works w i l l be appearing on
the bookshelf of the latest
leader of middle c l a s s para-
noia - Mrs Thatcher.
However to take them into
practice w i l l be a different
question compared to the
1930's, Mr P y e .
Y o u r s faithfully,
A l i Campbell
T h i s game eventually beg-

worn themselves out with half
an hours practicing before the
other team came out.
T h e ^ame q u i c k l y got un-
der way as R C S soon got the
first goal. The midfield and
attack kept up the good work
and soon had a few more
g o a l s . Croydon eventually
came back and with a heavy
a s s a u l t on the defence scored
their first goal. After a few
remarks to the defence about
technique(?) from our goal-
keeper - captain (Easy-Rider)
Strangeway, the game event-
ually restarted. B y the end o f
the first quarter R C S had a
well deserved lead.
In the second quarter R C S
kept up the attack and soon

had the goals pouring i n . With
a q u i c k breakaway from a
draw Croyden scored by run-
n i n g through a h e l p l e s s de-
fense. Soon after this the
game became quite rough with

In the third and fourth
quarters R C S forced home a
certain victory w i t h several
quick goals from the draw.
Croyden kept trying to fight
back but the defense held
them back, often more by luck

The final score was 5
