F R E E D O M O F S P E E C H i s an ideal
concept which, h i s t o r i c a l l y , has already
been impaired: censorship, the law of
l i b e l and D - n o t i c e s on the press are a l l
mechanisms designed to give.protection
to society, the individual and the gover-
nment respectively. Protection against
what? A g a i n s t obcenities & crudities,
defamatory untruths and information that
might breach national security .
It has been suggested that one's
freedom of speech should be impaired
further i n order to protect a small min -
ority, the overseas students within I C
(e*, extending i t to a national level, the
U K ' s immigrant population) from repres-
s i o n and intimidation by yet another
small minority. B u t before endorsing or
rejecting such a suggestion out o f hand,
three, criteria can be considered.
If the racist elements grow stronger,
w i l l violence become inherent in their
p o l i c i e s ? One side w i l l say no, never.
T h e other w i l l argue historically, this
is hound to happen . N o conclusions
can be drawn .Should people be allowed
to make up their won minds? One side
w i l l say yes, let's have free debate.
Don't make up people's minds for them.
T h e other side w i l l say the racists are
giving people the "soft sell"; wait for
too long and the situation will become
explosive. A g a i n , two points of view.
H o w can the vast majority of students
here make up their mind?
The third and final question i s this:
Do the overseas students in this c o l l -
ege feel oppressed, intimidated, b e l i t t l -
ed or demoralised by the racist propa-
ganda? There can be only one answer to
t h i s . It i s the answer which hammers the
s c a l e s o f the ultimately decisive criter-
ion: If a minority o f students in this
c o l l e g e i s being made to feel that they
are unwelcome, then something must be
done about i t . A t the beginning of the
session,overseas students are given a
generous welcome by the college. Is the
situation every going to arise where this
c o u l d be construed as hypocrisy?
May hell take the day when overseas
students feel that they would be unwel-
come at IC.
A t the moment i t i s not the Left nor
the Right but the overseas students who
are the losers. If the College does not
take an altitude on racism quickly, it
too could find itself among the losers
when its inlernational ties begin to de-
cay .

Dear Sir,
It was with great disgust
that I read your editorial i n the
last edition of F E L I X (no.378).
I refer, of course, to your rum-
ourmongering section concern-
ing the forthcoming e l e c t i o n s .
T h i s 1 consider to be in e x -
tremely bad taste and the cause
of great embarrassment to the
people mentioned i n your artic-
le. The art of reporting i s to
use certified fact and not i n -
dulge in the sort o f drunken
speculation more appropriate to
the environs of the Union bar. I
trust an apology w i l l be forth-
coming and F E L I X w i l l prevent
"that dastardly cur, Rumour"
from s o i l i n g his pages again .
I a l s o take great exception
to you refering to G u i l d s a s
"sparse", just because G u i l d s -
men do not engage themselves
in a s much u s e l e s s , idle goss-
ip a s yourself.
I anxiously await your re-
ply which w i l l no doubt be of
the bitchy nature we have come
to expect from the Editor of
F E L I X for anyone who has the
audacity to c r i t i c i s e the con-
tent o f his publication.
Yours faithfully

Until now both B r i t i s h and over
- seas P G ' s have been working
and l i v i n g together in an atmos-
phere of reasonable friendship.
The National Front, by being
allowed to propagate their
vile racist and fascist ideology
would poison this atmoshere.
While defending editorial
freedom, 1 would like to add
that this defence cannot be at
the expense of editorial
responsibility. Your less than
total condemnation of the
National Front, coupled with
your derogatoiy remarks about
certain sections of the left
(is the reason possibly a
paranoid hatred of the Left?)
give substance to the feeling
that you have
that you seem to have aband-
oned your editorial responsib-
i l i t y .
The only w i s h of most
overseas students i s to get on
with their work. In persuing
this aim, they tend to shy away
from any active involvement in
domestic p o l i t i c s . Thus attem
attempts to harass a peaceful
minority are to be condemned.
The harassment at the moment
is in the form of a subtle
psychological pressure being
brought to bear on them.
Unfortunately, F E L I X seems to
be acting as a vehicle for this ,

Tom Abraham

Dear Sir,
I should like to express
my disgust on behalf of the
overseas student, at the fact
that the F E L I X letters column
is being used to spread N F
propaganda. F E L I X i s partly
s u b s i d i z e d from Union funds
and is responsible through its
E d i t o r to the student body.

Dear Sir,
Prof. Bremsstrahlur.g i s
most annoyed that you have •
spelt h i s name wrongly for the
second time this term. He a s k s
me to point out that "Bremsst-
rahlung" i s spelt with a double
"s" and not as was printed in
F E L D C last week. H e sees this
as a slur on the good name o f
the family, and in particular on
grandpa Bremsstrahlung who,
as s c i e n t i f i c adviser to the
K a i s e r , gained fame by fitting
the entire German Army with
lightning conductors on their
h e l m e t s .

Dear Sir,
I have been interested to
observe the present verbal
battle between the Communist
and National Front elements at
IC . I went to the ' A n t i -
F a s c i s t ' Meeting and on reading
the refectory bumph about i t
afterwards from both parties,
have found that a reasonably
balanced view can be obtained
if both are taken with a large
pinch of s a l t .
It seems that the N F and
Communist parties do not
represent people in general,
but only particularly anarchist
groups o f society. Both
organisations have a pretty
dubious past — the Communist
party proposes to achieve i t s
aims by revolution (though it
has been said that such might
not be necessary in Britain of
America) and the s o - c a l l e d
"Crisis of Capitalism" seems
more like in this country a
" C r i s i s of Socialism" because
surely we are at least h a l f - w a y
towards a S o c i a l i s t - style
economy . The means of c o m -
munism (eg the bloody R u s s i a n
revolution, or the Stalinist
purges of 1936-38 when 8V2
million 'Trotskyites' were put
to death) do not seem to justify
the ends which, when we c o n -
