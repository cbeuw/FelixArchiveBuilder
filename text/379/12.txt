During the past few months, anyone v i s i t i n g the Putney E m -
bankment on a Thursday morning as dawn breaks, w i l l have seen 8
students braving the elements and taking to the water as members
of one o f the most unusual boat clubs in B r i t a i n . Although unknown
to probably 99% of I C students, there are no less than 6 full G.B..
internationals at IC, including
two Olympic oarsmen. T o these
can be added a Cambridge blue
and until recently the B . U . S . F .
C O X L E S S P A I R G o l d m e d a l i s t s .
F i v e of these oarsmen work for
Professor Cameron i n the L u b r i -
cation Laboratory in M e c h . E n g .
and with h i s encouragement got
together with the rest and formed
the "Lubrication Laboratory of
Imperial College. B.C." which
was registered with the A . R . A .
this year. Due to commitments
with other c l u b s and the Nation-
a l Squad they cannot row togeth-
er seriously but meet each Thur-
sday morning for a short outing
on the Thames.

were p i c k e d up by the Cambridge
launch and the work load ex-
plained. T h e outing was to con-

wed by 2 minutes rest, a 6 min-
ute row followed by 2 minutes
rest and finally another 3 minute
row. T h e crews joined up below

R a c e crew, themselves contain-
i n g four internationals, who have
been rowing together daily for
the past few months and who
wanted to get some experience
in the Putney reach before their
annual c l a s h with Oxford in
M a r c h . O n Saturday they dispat-
ched the Tideway Scullers with
ease. (The Scullers were, until
the recent formation o f the Nat-
ional Squad, generally regarded
as the National VIII.) On Sunday
they were to d o some intervals
with "Lub Lab". Unfortunately
the L a b had three of the first
choice oarsmen indisposed and
so had to boat three substitutes.
Despite the fact that one of them
was Mike Hart (Bronze Medalist
in the European Championships),
the crew was now completely
scratch and i n general gave
themsleves little chance. L e a v -

little idea of how much or o f

Cambridge, who were thoroughly
unsettled by its and at the end
of the 3 minutes the L a b had est-
a b l i s h e d a lead of third of a len-
gth . The 6 minutes interval was
rowed round the big Surrey bend
with Cambridge on the inside.
Again the L a b started down but
this time Cambridge, due to then
practice together managed to
maintain a higher rato and after
a c l a s h of oars just below Ham-
mersmith bridge, went clear and
finished 2 4 lenghts in the lead.
The final 3 minutes was rowed
off the remaining parts of the
Surry bend and up to Barnes
bridge. Cambridge again had the
better starts but the L a b r a l l i e d
and both crews finisshed the
piece at 36, Cambridge Yi in the
lead. The L a b ' s performance
considering their three subs and
one outing a week, was extrem-
ely good. When the crews meet
again in a few weeks time with
the L a b at full strength I doubt

On Saturday morning we arrived at Reading for the Southern Uni
versities Regatta to find the usual Reading conditions:- mud, rain
and more m u d .
The 1st VHI was entered in the Championship E i g h t s d i v i s i o n
Our first race was against O r i e l C o l l e g e Oxford and St.Edmund HE
Oxford . Despi te a shaky start
(someone forgot to take the
first stroke) we quickly pulled
ahead of both crews . We then
sat three lengths i n front of
St. Edmund H a l ! for the rest
of the race. Oriel were two or
three lengths behind St. E d -
mund H a l l . O u r next race was
against 1st and 3rd Trinity,
Cambridge who had previously
beaten Southampton. Since our
time i n the first round was
over twenty seconds faster
than theirs we were a bit over
confident and as a result our
rowing was not exactly b r i l l -
iant, but w e s t i l l came in s i x
lengths (24 sees) in front.
The final was against C l a r e
College, Cambridge. T h i s was
our best row of the day i n
which we pulled ahead o f
Clare fairly soon after the
start and were three lengths
up by the finish. We were pre-
sented with the Harp Lager
Trophy and individual pewter
pint tankards after the end o f
the regatta. A good start to
what we hope to be a succ-
e s s f u l s e a s o n .
The 2nd VIII were entered
in the Second E i g h t s d i v i s i o n .
Unfortunately they were beat-
H a l l
en by K i n g s C o l l e g e Cambrid-
ge and Pembroke College Ox-
ford in the first round. How-
ever I should point out that
both these crews were 1st
VIIIs s o what they were doing
in a 2nd VIIIs event I am not
quite sure.
The N o v i c e VIII (Lublab)
won their first round in the
N o v i c e d i v i s i o n against
C h e l s e a C o l l e g e and South-
ampton quite e a s i l y and in a
similar fashion beat Reading
in the second round. However
