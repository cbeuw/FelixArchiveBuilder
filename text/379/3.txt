S P E C U L A T I O N GROWS as elections hover on the IF horizon
There are n ne posts to be contested: President, V i c e President,
Secretary, S o c i a l Sec, Treasurer, Travel Sec, U s k Rep, and the
newly created post of Accommodations Sec, none of which are
sabbatical p o s t s . These elections take place at the end of this
term.
It is very important that IF
has a strong union committee.
Only with a strong union comm-
ittee can IF have any sort of
s o c i a l life. A s a secretarial
college we are more prone to
s l i p into the sort of nine to
five routine that k i l l s any (dare
I say it) community spirit and
this in turn deadens any enth-
usiasm for the academic side
of college. D i s c o s , dances and
dinners are not organised for
the sake of amusing a few
people for a few hours. Whether
they are a means of communic-
ation, a topic of conversation,
something to be approved of or
objected to, the fact remains
that the organisation of it, the
leading-up, the event itself and
the aftermath a l l create an i n -
terest which stimulate the daily
life of college.
Moreover a strong union com-
mittee is vital in order to bridge
the communication gap which
e x i s t s between the staff and the
students at I F . A b u s e s cannot
be righted until they are brought
to the attention of those con-
cerned. A t IF the barrier tends
to be more practical than psy-
c h o l o g i c a l . Most students here
have a full timetable from 9.00
am to 3.30 or 4.30 pm and they
just do not have the opportunity
to express their grievances,
which is where the members of
the U n i o n step i n . They, i n c i d -
entally, must possess a limit-
less abulity to make time.
Time is very much an im-
portant factor when it comes to
standing for a union post. E a c h
job demands more than its fair
share. Often, particularly in the
posts of President and Social
Sec at I F , it is a question of

it seems that ICWA is to be in the headlines for quite a while
yet; something which can only be welcomed, always assuming that
the publicity is good. T h i s , however, seems a little doubtful.
Hence, this a r t i c l e .
ICWA for the length of time it's existed has been a s e c i a l body,
and one which I believe valuably
contributes to the s o c i a l life of
the C o l l e g e . However, it far from
caters for everyone's tastes and
and has always had, perhaps
lustifyably, a rather genteel,
aide world image.
These very facts have promp-
ted a number of responsible, for-
ward-thinking members of the A s -
sociation to come to me to put
orward means of breathing new
ife into ICWA .Throughout the
nany d i s c u s s i o n s held in trie
past few weeks, they have emp-
hasised to me that they do w i s h
to stay part of the A s s o c i a t i o n ,
and that they are proposing an
extension of it's present a c t i v i -
ties rather than a change of the
already existing ones.
After much wrangling, I am
now prepared to act on their pro-
posals and give my support to
the 'Women in Science' group.
This group has ( and I stress
this point ), evolved from a body
of thought within the A s s o c i a -
tion, and as members have every
right to propose any change, pro-
viding it does not harm the A s s -
o c i a t i o n . It should not harm the
s o c i a l side of ICWA, as long as
it continues to recognise that
this is a valuable part of it's
existence . On the other hand, it
could do ICWA the world of good
by stimulating a greater number
of the women to take part and to
actually do something positive
to alleviate the problems, both
s o c i a l and academic, of the wo-
men in the C o l l e g e . It should
also be possible to make a s i g n -
ificant contribution towards the
Admissions P o l i c y on women,
both in making ah effort to en-
courage women into this college
and a more general basis in try-
ing to break down the barriers
discouraging women from taking
up s c i e n c e careers.

choosing between union work
and studies, and usually it is
the first which wins because it
is the most difficult to put off.
Meetings have to be attended,
letters have to be written,
phone c a l l s have to be answer-
ed, pracels have to be collected
and unfortunately one can a l -
ways obtain a few days' grace
for an e s s a y .
The most rewarding aspect
of being on the Union is that
one is made aware - aware not
only of people, plans and pro-
blems, but of petty politics as
w e l l . Intrigue, s c a n d a l , inside
information, oh it's a l l here1
Be in the know, be in the
Union!
L i k e w i s e each job demands
a lot of thought. One must have
the ability to question p o l i c i e s
passively accepted by others,
and to see a future (be it only a
short term basis) for the college
as a whole, and to have the
wi'll to influence this .Whether
one arouses favour or opposi-
tion is of little consequence:
both are signs of interest; the
big bugbear to be avoided at
all costs is apathy. The elect-
ions at the end of the term are
a unique opportunity to leave
the ranks of the apathetic and
to join the doers of this world.
