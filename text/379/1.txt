approached the Director of Trent

HAVING E X E C U T E D one o f the most daring mascotry
raids in recent years, the City and Guilds Union have now
come into the possession of 'Phineas', a 6 foot painted
plaster statue of a Scotsman, who is the mascot of Univer-
sity College London.
The mascot was in a swit-
chboard room underneath the
C o l l e g i a t e Theatre, Gordon
St. It was l y i n g in a pit, 3 ' 6 "
deep, covered with boards and
chained with a heavy duty
e l e c t r i c a l c a b l e .
The raid took place at 10
pm last Tuesday night when a
transit van and four cars arri-
ved at the theatre. A n advan-
ce group ' A ' , c o n s i s t i n g o f
five people, armed with bolt
cutters and electrical gear cut
the main gate open and reach-
ed the switchboard room via a
basement tunnel. Whilst this
was going on, an opera was
being performed on the very
stage that the mascot was
under.
The group cut the m a s c o t ' s
chains and raised it vertically
in the pit. They then c a l l e d
up group ' B ' by radio - tele-
phone. Group ' B ' (thirteeen
people) reached the location
at about 10.20 p m . A t this
point the opera finished - to
the mascoteers surprise.
Undeterred by the thought
of the crowds of people pour-
ing out of the theatre posing
the threat that they be spotted
when they tried to leave,
group ' B ' r a i s e d ' P h i n e a s ' out
of the p i t and took it back
down the tunnel (which was
only three inches wider than
the mascot itself). They emer-
ged from the basement, ming-
led with the crowds coming
from the opera, loaded the
mascot into the transit v a n
and left. Meanwhile, g r o u p ' A '
replaced the boards over the
pit and left by the same route.
Clearly, this was a superb
effort by Guilds to mark Pre-
sident Jenny Jones' birthday.
