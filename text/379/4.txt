N E X T WEEK is designated the
Week of Action. Elsewhere in this
FELIX what we plan is outlined. I
hope that we can ensure a large turn-
out on Tuesday and Friday. This is
crucial point in the campaign. It is
about now that the DES will be in its
discussions with the Treasury over
the amount of money that it gets for
the next year, particularly in respect
of the money needed to abolish the
anomalies in the grant system.
There are those who say that this
kind of action achieves very little.
However, some of us remember the
campaign on Union Autonomy of 1971-
72, which caused Mrs Thatcher, then
Secretary of State for Education, to
withdraw her proposals for political
control of Student Unions. It was
those "pointless demos" which show-
ed her the depth of feeling amongst
students (we had almost 1000 from
IC alone), and caused her capitulation
- by her own admisssion (see last
week's Sunday papers).
T h e r
e are those who say ^hat demos
alienate public op'n'on. T h i s is a com-
ment usually made by those who have
never been on one. In my own experience,
(and that includes a large number of dem-
os) public reaction on the route of a stu-
dent march i s in general sympathetic or
indifferent. There is occasional hostility,
but my own reaction has usually been to
try to explain the purpose of the demon-
stration to the person - and often with
some s u c c e s s . T h i s i s the way w e bring
home to the public the situation on both
grants and education. In terms of the ed-
ucation c u t s , I know tat parents w i l l be
behind students. The cuts made by L o c a l
Education Authorities in primary and s e c -
ondary schooling have caused near-riots
amongst parents in, for example, B u c k i n g -
hamshire (well-known centre o' militancy!)
This is the way that students will
achieve the change in the grants sys-
tem - and call for a fair deal for educ-
ation.
We are already seeing the effect of the
D E S policy for next year. The Governing
Body w i l l today be asked to approve fur-
ther cuts across the board in 1975-76,
probably followed by " s e l e c t i v e c u t s " .
Where w i l l those selective cuts fall? The
choice is either further deterioration of
academic f a c i l i t i e s , or cuts in ancillary
services - libraries, etc. It i s more than
likely that, unless we are able to transfer
to direct financing by the L E A ' s that the
Union w i l l be h i t . That means cuts to
clubs and societies, and a consequent re-
striction of student a c t i v i t i e s i n , for
example, sports.
We faced this problem three years
ago in an attach on Union Autonomy .
We face it again - but only with the
commitment and support of students
themselves.

THE GRANTS / CUTS CAMPAIGN
MRS. T.
I see that the race i s on for next year's
Union Officers. T r a d i t i o n a l l y , the " t o p
three" (Pres, D e p . Pres, and Hon Sec.)
take no stand in favour of any candidate.
However, I am w i l l i n g to give an opinion,
in private, for a small sum. Any takers,
for the backing of my massive influence?
By the way it's good to see that there are
so many candidates for the Amorary
Secretary, at l e a s t .
Congratulations to our Governor, Mrs .
Thatcher, on her election as Opposition
leader. I hope and expect that she w i l l
have a long and distinguished career in
that capacity. T h o s e of you who doubted
me when I forecast this in October, 1974,
may apologiese by post. I did make a £10
bet on her in October, but the other per-
son claims that he can't remember it!
How did I make the prediction?
The political reasoning is simple.
The Tories selected Thatcher and not
Whitelaw because they know that the
class divisions are there - and they
will do their utmost to preserve them.
HON S£C
ELECTIONS, ELECTIONS, ELECTIONS!
Nobody seems to talk of anything else these days.
By the time you read this all the nomination papers
should be up, you might even have received your first
piece of election bumph; that is if there is any oppos-
ition for any of the posts.
There are a lot of posts to be filled, but with over
4,000 students there should be plenty of people inter-
ested enough to stand. When the voting takes place,
people are needed to man ballot boxes ( £ 2 a session
during the two days of the election). More important,
people are needed to V O T E .
All that you need to vote is your nomination card,
and about five seconds. Surely it's worth it to register
an opionion and help elect someone.

NOTICE BOARD
A part of the notice-board in the J.C.R. has been
given to the Overseas Students Committee. Overseas
Students are asked to look at this notice-board for
notices concerning events organised by the Union
Committee, the Kensington Committee or the British
Council, and notices on other matters relevant to
them.
The notice-board may also be used by National
Societies, specially to advertise events of a more
general interest.

Diary o r no diary?
Multifarious preponderance encompasses the whole issue of
whether or not on IC Union Diary should appear for the 1975-76
s e s s i o n .While some students find the publication very useful,
others are totally against i t .
A very interesting suggestion comes from Richard Upton ( l n T .
dustrial Sociology Unit, PG) mentioned the p o s s i b i l i t y of produc-
ing an IC Union plastic cover for registration card, NUS card and
an IC Union information card .
What are your view? A l l comments are most urgently sought
and w i l l be eagerly considered by me.
