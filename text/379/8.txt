Disinvestment
D U R H A M University Students are continuing their fight to pre-
vent their University investing i n companies w h i c h themselves
have large investments i n South A f r i c a .
L a s t tenn the i s s u e w a s '
voted on b y the student body,
the voting being carried out i n
individual colleges following
debates. 6 3 % of votes were for
disinvestment (about 4 0 % of
students voted). A staff p o l l of-
fered the c h o i c e of disinvest-
ing, harassing companies about
South A f r i c a , or doing northing.
The majority were for harass-
ment, with one third of the staff
v o t i n g . The U n i v e r s i t y d i d n o t
consider that, this represented a
mandate for disinvestment tho-
ugh i t has been recognised that
disinvestment i s a viable p o l -

Students Union s a i d that the
University was i n effect ignor-
ing a vote it had requested.
Tomorrow there w i l l be a Nat-

sity, which i s to be attended by
students from U n i v e r s i t i e s thro-

thenational campaign to remove
University investment from
companies with large South
African interests.

refectories at least break even at the end of the s e s s i o n . T h e

of 12%.
T h i s increase which would
be effective from A p r i l 1st wo-

The price increase o f A u g -

but due to soaring c o s t s this

T h e quinquennial submiss-

TWO P O L I T I C A L L Y polarised meetings took place yesterday
in C o l l e g e block: one under the a u s p i c e s of the N a t i o n a l Front,
the other was a n impromptu meeting chaired by the president of
I C U to d i s c u s s ways of fighting r a c i a l i s m and f a s c i s m .
The
The Left wing group then
decided to enter lecture theatre
A and h o l d their meeting alth-
ough this had not been booked
for such a purpose. After a
brief d i s c u s s i o n between the
Bursar and the I C U President,
however, the meeting d i d take
place.
T h e N F meeting c l a i m e d
that their attendance w a s l o w
because of the B u r s a r ' s direct-
ive and because some o f their
supporters had shied away for
fear of intimidation.
The L e f t ' s meeting d i s c u s -
sed w a y o f combating r a c i a l i s m
and f a s c i s m and made several
proposals which i n c l u d e d est-
a b l i s h i n g a regular broadsheet
to present arguments against
racialism and f a s c i s m ; i n v i t -
ing speakers such a s Ian Mik-
ado or Steve Parry to address
future meetings; and one idea
was to organise a trip to see
an anti-fascist play being per-
formed on the South B a n k
"Adventures of Jackboot".
N F meeting, which
numbered fourteen people ( i n -
c l u d i n g guest speakers), w a s
h e l d i n lecture theatre B .
There w a s a directive from
die Domestic B u r s a r that the
meeting should n o t b e p u b l i c -
i s e d and that people should be
privately invited to a t t e n d .
Despite this directive, Left
wing factions d i d manage to
determine the time and location
of the meeting and a peaceful
p i c k e t was h e l d a t the door to
the meeting.

v/ould be a short fall of £65,000. F i r s t l y , there i s a " . . . . n e e d to
attract more c u s t o m " and
secondly that the refectories
are under-used. " I t would be
an improvement i f each o f the
three main refectories were
given some kind o f c h a r a c t e r " .
One suggestion to help achieve
this would be to partition South
side " i n such a way as to give
a series o f three-sided " b a y s " .
On the second point i t sugges-
ted that one of the refectories
be c l o s e d down and the room
u s e d for some other purpose.
It i s perhaps regretful that
i n a paper of such importance
there i s no stress l a i d on the
abysmally low quality o f food
served i n the refectories. T h e
next quinquennial may y e t s e e
a change.
