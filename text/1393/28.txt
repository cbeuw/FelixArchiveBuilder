Frets on Fire
http://fretsonfire.source-
forge.net/
Playing Frets on Fire is as easy
as starting the game, picking a
song and picking up you key-
board. That’s right, go on. Pick
it up. Now hold the F1-F5 keys
for your left hand and Enter for
your right. Got it? Good, now
you too can experience the diz-
zying sense of failure unique to
rhythm games! It’s also a great
workout – my pinky hasn’t
been this sore since my first
girlfriend!
While not a perfect analogue
to a guitar, the keyboard-as-a-
guitar idea is the type of off-
the-wall idea that makes this
Guitar Hero-lookalike work.
If you’ve never played the
original, this free game is a
perfect introduction to the
genre. It only comes with a
slim 3 songs, but a bit of goog-
ling should quickly find you the
numerous song packs floating
around the interwebs.

Synaesthete, nominated for
this year’s Independent Games
Festival, is Darwinia’s and
Dance Dance Revolution il-
legitimate offspring, combin-
ing the graphics of the former
with the rhythm game as-
pects of the latter in a quirky
third-person shooter. With an
ever-changing trance/house/
drum’n’bass track in the back-
ground, your avatar (the Zaik-
man, a three-dimensional stick
figure) destroys swarms of en-
emies by matching three but-
tons to the background beat,
all while moving around from
a third-person view.
It’s all sparkly blurred neon,
with striking similarities to
Tron’s early visions of cyber-
space. It’s definitely a differ-
ent take on the rhythm game
genre, being fresh, psyche-
delic, beautiful and fun. If you
want to try something differ-
ent, I highly recommend sitting
down for the hour it takes to
beat the game. Har har har.

System Shock 2 was the landmark title
of an era. One of the most open-ended
and atmospheric first-person games to
be released, it combined RPG and FPS
elements far more successfully than all
previous attempts at it (in Ultima Un-
derworld, no less) and had compelling
storytelling throughout. Better yet, it
was terrifying. While System Shock 1
had been a success, it was System Shock
2 that really put Looking Glass Studios
on the map. The game can be seen
as the main source of inspiration for
Deus Ex and, more recently, BioShock
– forming a trio of games that appear
on almost everyone’s “Best.Games.
Evar!” lists.
While System Shock’s gameplay was
good, it was its writing that set it apart
from the rest of the pack, most signifi-
cantly Half-Life (with which it was in
direct competition at the time of its
release). Where System Shock opted
for expositions by long-dead crew
members through audio logs scattered
across the game world (sound famil-
iar?), most other FPS games opted for
having non-player characters reveal
most of the storyline. In many ways,
it was the complete absence of other
(sane) characters on-board the Rick-
enbacker and Von Braun that made
the game feel so eerie. Every creak of
a door hinge, every footstep, every
agonized groan was hostile – and with
rapidly degrading weapons and scarce
ammunition supplies, every hostile
had the potential to be lethal.
And if that didn’t scare you, the na-
ture of the hostiles would. To start with
they were all soulless, mutated people,
still wearing the remains of their shred-
ded trousers, pierced through the neck
by a 5-foot parasitic worm. As they
stalked the corridors of the deserted
spaceship, you never knew when you
were going to turn the corner and face
a wrench swinging towards your face.
As you moved closer to the source of
the infestation the mutations grew
worse, birthing hunch-backed mon-
strosities, all flesh and sharp teeth, that
had somehow all been human at some
point. It was the kind of thing that put
Half-Life’s zombies to shame.
The similarities between System
Shock 2 and BioShock should be ob-
vious – from the method of story-
telling to the story of a society in ex-
treme circumstances being destroyed
from within. The former inhabitants’
consciousness reduced to the most
primal instincts, driven by a will not
their own. Both games recognized the
haunting nature of such a story and
embraced it fully, leaving you to wan-
der the desolate halls, paranoid and on
edge throughout.
The differences between the two are
mainly cosmetic, but do make a great
difference. System Shock 2 is set on a
spaceship, lightyears away from any-
thing resembling home – BioShock
thousands of feet below the sea in a
utopic city: a place just as alien. The
other difference, though, is one of
choice. System Shock 2 made you se-
lect a branch of the military, with each
of the three choices affecting the way
you do combat and the resources avail-
able to you. BioShock made the choic-
es more streamlined – every player
could use Psi pow..., I mean plasmids,
with the allocation of cybernetic, err,
ADAM limited to these skills and a few
minor passive upgrades. In a big way,
System Shock 2 was more open-ended
than BioShock, featuring a greater de-
gree of replayability than its successor.
However, that’s not to say that Bi-
oShock isn’t an excellent game – it is.
Its art sets the bar far higher than any
game before it, and really, recycling a
few (great) ideas from System Shock 2
is hardly a bad idea. BioShock is a very
fitting continuation to the legacy of
System Shock, and gamers are better
off to have two such fine games exist.
It is a shame, however, that both games
feature a completely throw-away boss
encounter – a final reminder that the
games truly are of the same heritage.
Similarities
Story is told through voice recordings of dead
characters
Player is guided by a seemingly benevolent
character
Player has supernatural powers
RPG elements of inventory management and
upgrades
Enemies are formerly humans
Differences
Greater choice of playing style in System Shock
Settings and environment
BioShock has a faster pace than System Shock
BioShock has the finest game art ever, System
Shock is (and yes, was) a bit meh
Higher emphasis on supernatural abilities in
BioShock
S
equels sell. Fact. You can
write whatever you want
about continuations being
unimaginative, repetitious
and plain grating at times,
but they’re the ones that unfortunately
rake in the monies.
So, it’s always encouraging in situa-
tions when sequels are usually rather
excellent and maintain a certain level
of quality and distinction. Of course,
sometimes you don’t just want to just
continue the mythos but rather build
on what was brilliant and then retain
the soul as you prepare to transfer to a
new vessel.
Such games aren’t strictly sequels but
neither are they wholly celibate, origi-
nal titles. Join us as we take a look at
some of more inspiring ones.
