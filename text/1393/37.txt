It’s the time of year for you to dig out
your running shoes, get back into
shape and get ready for the best race
of the year, the Hyde Park Relays.
This year is the 60th anniversary so
it will be bigger and better than ever
before,notonlybecausethestandard
there will be an even bigger range of
standards (first-time runners to fu-
ture internationals) and the party at
DB’s will be a blur in your memory
but also because instead of boring
baguettes with jam, there will be a
scrumptious curry with jacket pota-
toes to look forward to, as you huff
and puff your way around the scenic
Hyde Park course.
If that hasn’t whetted your appetite
there are prizes for the first internal
Men’s and Women’s teams, so you
can show your rival department/
sports team/mum who’s boss. How-
ever if you can’t quite manage this,
there is always booby prizes for the
last team in!
800 runners will be coming from
all over the country as well as France,
Holland, Germany, Italy and Poland
to name just a few. It’s a great chance
Sunday 20th January marked the start
of the IC Ladies’ 2nds’ campaign in the
ULU Reserve Cup competition. It was
to be a busy day at Harlington with two
IC Medics’ teams, four IC teams and
one RSM team playing in ULU Hock-
ey Cup matches. With the IC Men’s
2nds scaring the opposition away and
taking an early walkover, the rest of
ICHC travelled by luxury coach to
Harlington. The return of Spanner in
goal, who incidentally has never lost a
Cup match, meant that the ladies were
in high spirits and ready to face GKT
3rds, who are currently bottom of the
league above us in BUSA.
The game went underway with both
teams making positive starts. It was
clear from the beginning that this was
to be a close match, with both teams
playing a similar level of hockey. IC
had a few close chances early on, with
AA, Isabel and Brownie all seeing op-
portunities to score. Before long, some
good, smooth stick passing down the
right by Hoover and Isabel resulted
in IC drawing first blood, with a goal
neatly slotted in by Captain Ghost-
buster. GKT worked their way back
with some good play through midfield
but Spanner’s deadly habit of charging
and diving prevented them from scor-
ing. IC had another good period of
play and Spandex came close to find-
ing the back of the net. Shortly before
half time, GKT rudely secured a goal
from a short corner having just injured
our very own Unicycle from a previous
unsuccessful short corner routine.
After some inspiring team talk at
half time, IC started the second half
on fire, bursting out of the blocks with
some slick two-touch hockey and con-
centrating on moving the ball early as
well as taking advantage of the whole
width of the pitch to bypass the op-
position’s midfield. Both teams made
good chances to score but it was IC
who broke the deadlock, with Brownie
scoring a goal which originated from
a perfectly executed short corner rou-
tine. IC held on to the lead for a while
but with 15 minutes to go, GKT equal-
ised after a period of sustained pres-
sure, despite the best efforts of Span-
Determined IC ladies

ner in the IC goal.
The battling spirit of the IC Ladies
came through, with a rallying call from
3 Times a Lady in defence, spurring
the whole team on. IC kept their heads
up and after numerous unsuccessful
attacks, were finally rewarded a goal,
with Brownie scoring her second of the
match thanks to some smooth passing
through midfield.
Despite several hair-raising mo-
ments during the dying minutes of the
game, solid defending from Domina-
tor, Thombelina, Unicycle and 3 Times
a Lady meant that IC managed to hold
on to the lead and prevented the match
from reaching penalty flicks, emerging
from the final whistle victorious.
Thanks must go to our most vo-
cal supporter of the day, Mountie, for
shouting invaluable instructions, mak-
ing effective substitutions and gener-
ally spurring the team on throughout
the match.
With the mission accomplished, it
was down to the pub for some celebra-
tory drinks. ‘Man of the Match’ was
awarded to Spandex for excellent all
round effort. ‘Twat of the Match’ was
Unicycle for injuring her own team-
mate from a free hit... after the full
time whistle was blown!
to test yourself and to meet some
new people. The night afterwards
is probably the only time in the year
you will see the Union full and all
the crazy foreign teams will make it
unmissable.
So get some friends together and
put your names down for the Hyde
Park Relays. The Women’s race will
consist of 4 runners, running 3k each
and the Men’s will consist of 6 run-
ners running 5k each. Mixed teams
(any combination) can also partici-
pate in the Men’s race. The races kick
off at 2pm on 9th February by the
bandstand in Hyde Park. Registra-
tion is from 10:30-12:00noon in Beit
where you get your numbers and
maps of the course. More details,
along with the entry form, can be
found on the event website: http://
www.union.ic.ac.uk/acc/hpr
The entry deadline is 2nd February,
so don’t delay! Get your form filled
in and take it to the Union reception
(first floor of Union Building, on the
left) with an accompanying cheque.
Forms are also available in the re-
ception and in the Student Activities
Centre. So get prepared: Hyde Park
Relays, 9th February 2008.
