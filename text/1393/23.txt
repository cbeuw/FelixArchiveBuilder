Deerstalker hat
I was considering not putting
this in because I’ve seen a
few unattractive old (over 30)
people wearing them. But
then I thought, how superficial
would that be?
Pixie Geldof
Quite amusing in a nihlistic
way. Her sister Peaches looks
derriere-garde in comparison.
Horn-rimmed glasses
In an All The President’s men
style. Johnny Depp wears
them. Of course you could
never hope to look as beauti-
ful as he.
Yelle
I have no idea what she sings
about (her being french), but it
makes my ears smile.

Spring Summer ‘08
Catwalk Sounds
Here be tracklistings of songs played

walks. Whet your appetite for Au-
tumn/Winter ‘08 London Fashion
Week!
Fashion and music go together like
Andy Warhol and money. Listen to

you will be it. But you probably won’t.
