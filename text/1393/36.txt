How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is simi-
lar to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw lines be-
tween the dots to create one long, and most
importantly, looping line. It should have no
start or finish; just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many lines
should be drawn around it, for example:
Cells which don’t contain a number can be
surrounded by any number of lines.
Remember, the line must form a loop, so
the line cannot branch. The following situa-
tions are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There are
never cells containing the number 4 in
Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most com-
mon place to start on a Slitherlink grid is by
drawing crosses around any zeros. Drawing
crosses is purely done to so that you know
where there can’t possibly be a line. So, take
the pattern below as an example. Begin by
drawing crosses, then by filling in some
lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the fol-
lowing directions:
Yeah, we realised that we printed the answer
to last week’s Slitherlink in the same issue.

Logic Puzzle: Southside Sardines
Using the clues and logical deduction
alone, work out how all the people
involved in the match relate to each
other. The puzzle can be solved with-
out guesswork. Make use of the grid to
mark the combinations that you know.
Read through each clue and make any
obvious or stated deductions. Find the
corresponding row and column on the
grid and place a tick for ‘Yes’ in the box,
and a cross for ‘No’ in the cells next to
this one vertically and horizontally.
Ensure that you read the clues care-
fully. They can sometimes reveal mul-
tiple hints! Remember that elimination
of alternatives is a key method. That is
where the grid is so important - it al-
lows you to see the possibilities left.
Five students from Imperial live in a
newly rebuilt halls of residence near
college. There are twenty rooms per
floor (they really stuff them in!), so
anyone in a flat with a “higher number
than” isn’t necessarily on a higher floor.
