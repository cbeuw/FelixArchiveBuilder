Sabbatical nominations
open on Monday
Tom Roberts
Editor-in-Chief
The quest to find the next Union President, three Deputy
Presidents and a new Felix Editor begins next week
This year’s Sabbatical elections timeta-
ble was finalised at Union Council on
Monday evening.
Imperial students who fancy them-
selves as the next Union President,
one of three Deputy Presidents or
as the Felix Editor will be able to put
themselves forward for nomination on
Monday 28th January. There are also
two positions available on the recently
formed Trustee Board and eight NUS
Annual Conference delegate positions
up for grabs.
Any Imperial student can stand in the
elections. All they need to do is log on
to the Union’s website at www.imperi-
alcollegeunion.org/vote and put them-
selves forward. Nominees then require
20 “seconders”, in other words, 20 other
Imperial students or friends who must
log on to the website and recommend
you as a worthy candidate.
The nominations period lasts for two
weeks so students have plenty of time
to decide whether they want to stand
or not. In next week’s issue, Felix will
be interviewing and grilling the cur-
rent Sabbatical Officers about their
experiences so far, hopefully to give
the rest of the student body an idea of
what it is like to be in such a position of
responsibility.
Students who successfully manage to
cajole 20 people into seconding them
will subsequently embark on a month-
long election campaign. Nominees
will have to come up with an election
manifesto by Friday 15th February,
which will be published on the Union’s
website, in Felix and on Live! (live.cgcu.
net).
During February there will also be
two Hustings, where nominees will
have to give short speeches about what
changes (if any) they intend to bring to
the Union and justify why they are up
to the task of taking over their respec-
tive mantles. The second half of each
Hustings involves questions from the
floor.
Eventually voting opens on Friday
22nd February and lasts until Tues-
day 26th February. During this time,
nominees will be out and about around
campus canvassing students for their
votes.
Nominees should pencil in the Tues-
day 27th February as the Final Candi-
dates meeting where the results will be
announced. However, judging by pre-
vious Sabbatical elections which have
spiralled into theatrical farce due to
complaints of foul play between com-
petitors, this date is liable to shift into
March.
If you want to stand, put yourself
up for nomination by visiting
www.imperialcollegeunion.org/
vote from Monday onwards.
Good luck to all participants

Election results at last
Results were finally announced for
the Presidential election on Thurs-
day lunchtime, completing an elec-
tion period that has been character-
ised by Felix’s favourite five letter
word: farce.
The next Union President will be
the well-known anti-NUS figure-
head at IC and Felix Comment
Editor, Stephen Brown, who beat
the current Deputy President
(Finance & Services), Jon Mat-
thews, to take the position. Mr
Brown received 705 votes (af-
ter the transfer of preference
votes for the other candidates),
while Mr Matthews received
595 votes. Mr Brown and
Mr Matthews both re-
ceived several hun-
dred more votes
than the ‘outsider’
candidates; Diogo
Geraldes (he who
held a sign up over
Mr Matthews head
at hustings reading
“WTF?”) lead the los-
er’s field, picking up 179
votes, presumably from people
with a sense of humour. Sophie
Spillard, one of only two female
candidates standing for a sabb
position, collected 143 votes,
while the “not-really-from-South-
well Slate” candidate Julian Gian-
nuzzi picked up only 98 votes.
The position of Felix Editor was
contested by two Felix veterans,
Tom Roberts and Emily Lines, and
a new face, Ben Sinclair. Mr Sin-
clair, who had his name changed on
the ballot to ‘Felix’ as this is appar-
ently his nickname, picked up 367
votes, only 100 votes less than
Miss Lines and Mr Roberts re-
ceived. In the first round of
voting, the two well-known
Felix names were sepa-
rated by only 19 votes.
H
Mr Sinclair, Mr Roberts was elect-
ed with 625 votes, having picked
up more second preference votes
than Miss Lines (who received 576
votes).
Deputy President (Clubs & Socie-
ties) was contested by a ‘clubs vet-
eran’, Alistair Cott, and a member
of the Slate, Alexander Balikhin.
The experienced Mr Cott won
with 687 votes compared to Mr Ba-
likhan’s 300, despite Mr Cott’s lack
of campaigning.
Four candidates stood for Deputy
President (Finance & Services), in-
cluding a Slate member, an ex-Wye
President, and a relative outsider.
