Felix Festive Fundraiser results
Last term Tom Roberts and I spent a
Saturday morning begging and cajol-
ing various shops on High Street Ken-
sington to give us prizes for the Felix
Festive Fundraiser.
After an exhausting day we came
away with over £250 worth of fabulous
prizes to be raffled off to one lucky
winner. The prizes included: cham-
pagne, festive food goodies, DVDs, a
memory stick, a teddy bear hot water
bottle, games, guidebooks. a day sack,
gift vouchers, towels and chocolates!
Along with Alex Casey and Kris Till
we then spent four days badgering
most of you into parting with cash in
order to enter the competition. The re-
sponse was amazing, and some people
entered up to 10 times!
Altogether the Felix Festive Fund-
raiser raised an amazing £375 for the
Oxfam Unwrapped Campaign. Thank
you to everyone who bought a ticket
and donated to the cause!

Sally Longstaff
Fundraising Organiser Felix would like to thank the
following shops and business-
es who contributed prizes:
£50: 2 x Goats: A goat (always
bought locally) will provide peo-
ple with fertiliser to spread, milk
to drink and sell, plus kids too!
Noolarmi Kilanga bought nine
goats under Oxfam’s restocking
programme in her village in Tan-
zania, and feels her life has been
transformed. “My children have
milk, and I won’t miss food again.
And when they multiply, I can sell
one to buy things for my family.”
£48: 2 x Teach a Teacher: This
teach a teacher gift will help to
train more teachers and give
them the support they need to do
their jobs even better.
£24: 6 x Textbooks: These text-
books will be a great addition to
the community school and help
countless kids with their lessons
over the years.
£49: 1 x Reading Classes for
Seven Adults: The reading class-
es gift will give seven adults who
have never been to school the
chance to learn to read their chil-
dren’s homework, their prescrip-
tions, or anything else! Writing
skills are also taught. The picture
shows Adi Yatani of the Kalacha
Women’s Group, writing her
name during an adult literacy les-
son supported by Oxfam.
£26: 1 x Share in a Well: This
will help to bring a reliable water
source to communities and their
livestock in remote parts of the
world - with plenty left over to
water the veggie patch! The pic-
ture shows girls collecting water
at an Oxfam well in Kebkabiye,
North Dafur. “We used to collect
water from far away. Now eve-
rything in easier and safer” says
Kalton Ibrahim Deen.
£100: 1 x Medicine Kit: This
covers sanitary kits, first aid kits
and simple drugs that can help
a community health worker to
make someone’s life a lot better.
£50: 1 x “Build a Bog” Package:
This build a bog gift will provide
all the tools, training and labour
needed to built toilets for school
chldren and people in emergency
situations. Ntombizodura Maru-
fu says, “Because of Oxfam, I’ve
had a toilet for 7 months, which
means that disease isn’t spreading
to my children and the commu-
nity. It’s very beautiful, and even
has a tap for cleaning hands!”.
£28: 14 x Bags of Seeds: This gift
will help to get quality checked
seeds to the people who need
them most - so they can grow
more, eat more and sell more.
who described himself as being “well
chuffed”!
The Oxfam Unwrapped campaign
has been running since 2004. It pro-
vides a selection of gifts for people in
need, which can be purchased by the
public. Contrary to many of your con-
cerns, all the proceeds from the raffle
went to this campaign - none to Felix!
Gifts are carefully selected following
feedback from communities on what is
needed most to overcome poverty and
suffering. The impact gifts have are
monitored.
With the money raised, Felix bought
a range of gifts which can be seen be-
low, with a little explanation of how
they will help.
Thank you to everyone who helped
make this event a success, including
all of you who parted with cash to help
out others in need!
