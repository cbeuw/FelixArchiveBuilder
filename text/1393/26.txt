Checking up on the latest goings on
in Facebook or MySpace is a breeze
thanks to the Safari based web browser
and a full range of connectivity options,
including WiFi, HSDPA (3.5G) and
GPRS. Viewing these sites is no trou-
ble thanks to the 800x352 pixel screen,
showing me the full width of the web-
page. Email is also a painless experi-
ence - where a normal phone would
show an inbox for texts, I also get a list
of emails to peruse at my leisure.
However, despite this being a busi-
ness device, Nokia have thoughtfully
included a wide range of multimedia
features more akin to what one would
find on their N-series devices. I’ve got
my music player (with 2.5mm head-
phone jack) for MP3’s, AAC’s, WMA’s
and most other compression acronyms
you care to mention. I can also play the
podcasts I found whilst browsing the
web, or an audio book detailing the ins
andoutsofspeed-datingfordummies...
or whatever takes your fancy. There’s
a 3.2 megapixel auto focus camera
for those spur-of-the-moment snaps,
which can incidentally also take ‘DVD
quality’ (read TV resolution) videos, so
you can make your own home movie
- perhaps after a successful speed dat-
ing session... and finally, there is what
has to be one of my favorite uses for
this device - a video player. Whether
by chance or on purpose, Nokia have
created a screen the exact shape of
most Hollywood blockbusters. In oth-
er words, this beast will play videos at
a higher resolution than your TV and
with a pixel density greater than any
HDTV, movies will look and playback
flawlessly thanks to the inbuilt video
card. I defy you to find a media player
on the market to outperform it.
The thing is, I’m still stuck with an
enormous phone and a laptop too
small to type on with any more than
two fingers per hand. Nokia have made
appalling use of the space on the out-
side of the phone and the shortcuts on
the inner keyboard are obscure to say
the least. There is also no denying that
this is a fat, heavy, metal-cased brick...
but then on the off chance that I get
kidnapped walking home from college,
i can knock my assailant out with it and
in true Imperial fashion find the opti-
mum route home with the built-in GPS
and mapping software; and you know,
despite the drawbacks, should I choose
to I can leave my laptop at home, take
this massive phone into lectures, open
it up and make my mate’s tiny EEEPC
look, well...rather large.
So how do you pick which phone to
buy, not just from the tiny handful here
but from the whole phone market?
Well the best way seems to be to figure
what kind of contract you want. For ex-
ample, how much do you want to pay
a month and what volume of calls and
texts do you want. Once you’ve got all
that together, decide what features you
want from the phone, none of them
have everything, and see which of the
models available on your contract best
suits your needs.
T
he Tablet PC brought us
a step closer to that fu-
turistic world we see on
Star-Trek. With the ability
to use your PC as a sheet
of paper a whole wealth of options are
suddenly opened up. Midnight dead-
lines on mathematics can be handed
in, hand-written, hours after the sub-
missions office has closed without hav-
ing to contemplate who designed Mi-
crosoft Equation Editor and work out
what their grudge against the scientific
community was.
I’ve got a fairly old model of Tablet
PC; none the less, it still comes with
all the features needed from a PC. A
1.7Ghz Pentium Mobile, 512MB of
RAM (upgraded to 1GB for Vista) and,
for the time-generous, a 60GB hard-
drive with a 14.1” screen. Day to day
it’s your standard laptop with keyboard
and annoying trackpad, but obviously
it all changes in Tablet PC mode.
With a special pen that comes with
the PC, the monitor can detect where
you are pointing on the screen, so you
can use it instead of that trackpad. My
laptop came pre-loaded with XP Tablet
PC Edition with built-in handwriting
recognition, as do all flavours of Vista,
and this can be used to input text into
any area. Simply waggle the pen above
the screen and you’ll activate the input-
panel. Anything you write in this will
be translated into standard text with
impressive accuracy. Windows takes
the shape drawn and the path taken
to draw it to guess the word you’re
writing. It will then compare this to
the sentence that you’ve written and
Is it supposed to do that?
Andrew Slater explains why some people’s laptops bend the wrong way
choose the most probable word that’s
grammatically correct. By combining
these with ongoing learning from daily
use it quickly becomes smooth enough
to use for fast-response areas such as
online messaging.
There’s also a variety of tools avail-
able for Tablet PC users. Office comes
with the ability to annotate documents
with ink, Windows provides Journal as
a basic (paper-style) notepad and there
are many downloadable applications
such as PDF Annotator which allows
you to scribble on your lecturer’s notes
in PDF form, so you can always make
corrections later. There are also arty
tools available which can take into ac-
count the pressure that you press onto
the screen for smudge effects and such.
I now find that I don’t carry around
paper or a pen, if I need to scribble I
flip it into Tablet mode. Drawing dia-
grams and embedding them into work
without a scanner, the ability to correct
things drawn in pen or even copy-paste
a long equation to the next line are all
things I’ve come to use often.
So why don’t we all have Tablet PCs?
Most Tablets are at least £100 more
than their normal brothers, if not up
to £200 more for functionality that
many just won’t use. Then there’s the
screen itself, with some nifty engi-
neering to get the screen to pivot and
collapse back onto its own keyboard,
however this can be a weak point and
may be prone to break with prolonged
use. Lastly, there’s the size. Everyone
with this tech in Sci-Fi is using super-
thin screens which weigh nothing and
have huge functionality. Unfortunately
that’s not the case today, however the
situation is improving, with smaller
and lighter tablets that you would
happily rest on your arm whilst writ-
ing on them, just like a notebook or
clipboard. A MacBook Air style Tablet
would be perfect, wireless functional-
ity and extremely portable, let’s hope
the rumours of a Mac Tablet are true!
And who knows, we get lucky and not
have a Mac pricetag to weigh the thing
down.
On a side-note, tablets are increas-
ingly being used as a tool in the crea-
tive media. Greater software support
is being produced allowing you to
emulate pencil sketcing and oil paint-
ing with surprising realism. Graphic
designers also depend upon this little
tools to make their jobs possible.
To those that frequently have to scan
notes into a document, include hand-
drawn diagrams or even help a mate
with maths work over MSN, a Tablet
PC is perfect providing quick and easy
access to scribble on your PC. There
are even some gimmicky but fun games
that have been developed for tablets.
If you think these features would be
kinda cool, but ultimately would never
use them, then stick with a standard
laptop and save yourself a few hundred
pounds. Or maybe just blow it all on
something else.
Honestly, it’s meant to look like someone broke it
LG Viewty - Similiar to the iPhone but with a sensible price Nokia e90 - Just look at it. It’s huge. At least no one will steal it
