Virgo
This week you’re
accussed of being
an “infilitrating
philistine” by
the National
Government of
International Art Critics Anonymous. The
accusation leads to several High Court
appearances and also a Petty Claims Court
appearance after you lose a suit button in
a brief scuffle with your opponent’s lawyer
George Awe-Ell Van Goff.
Scorpio
“Excuse me?”
“What’s that?
“W-What?”
“That...”
“W-w-this? Er...
Well, you know. I
stumbled.”
“‘Stumbled?’ How in blue jebus?”
“You know, member... on vacuum. Shit
happens. Minor accident, nothing to see here.”
“You bloody sexual deviant you. WINK.
WINK.”
Libra
Blud, I can hear
them sirens com-
ing. BRAP. I can
here them sirens
coming. BRAP. FIX
UP LOOK SHARP,
you don’ wanna see me get up in the hills and
shizzle you with a thunderous parp. I’m just
a bizzle in the corner learnin’ me A-Levels in
Maths, English and Sciences. BRAP.
Sagittarius
This is a SUPER
horoscope. SUPER
in the sense of capi-
talised letter, SUPER
Mario mushrooms
and SUPED up TVR
automobiles. If you consume this horoscope,
you’ll be dancing on fire for the rest of the day,
shooting hoops and going for the GOAL! Now,
GO! Be young, free, frivolous and enjoy your-
self whilst you can before your SUPERpower
runs out! Huzzah!
Capricorn
Smegma. It’s been
suggested that the
next horoscope be
written about the
word in question,
however I’m going
to flat out deny this opportunity by casting my
Editorial Powers of Jupiter spell. 9 beats 6. HA!
Come back for more when you think you’ve
got enough hair on your chest.
Cancer
Haggis becomes
a worldwide
phenomenon
overnight. Critics
call it a “snowballing
success of gigantic
proportions.” The Daily Sausage Roll
proclaims it the most significant “work since
Gandhi himself devoured a Cornish Pasty.
Scotland’s coming for you. Be afraid.
Gemini
This week you
crash out on your
girlfriend’s sofa,
naked and covered
in broken silicon
chips. Upon waking
in the morning, you find your girlfriend
savagely deformed, strung up by her tendons
on the nearest curtain rail. Police lights throw
the room into a red-blue sea of muffled
colours. Do you, A: hide in the chimney, B: Eat
any traces of your girlfriend, or C: implode.
Leo
Version 6.1 of
Bilgepump 2000
turns up just in time
for your dinner.
Sneakily, whilst
your mammy isn’t
looking, you whip it out and turn your plate of
food into a banquet fit for Jady Goody. Your
cruel trick isn’t helping your mother though, is
it? Be honest. Tell her that her cooking sucks
balls. Watch her world shatter in front of you
It’s for the best. The bitch’ll get through it. Ho.
Taurus
This week your
every move is
accompanied by
a soundtrack, just
to the rear left of
your ear. Cycling
to university, Eye of the Tiger spurs you on.
In lectures, Twinkle Twinkle sends you into a
soft slumber and talking to the lady who works
behind Union reception, Al Green serenades
both your ears’ with his soulful tunes and
blissful words.
Aries
Your local is selling
a neat variety of
tipple that drinks
itself for you, thus
reducing crime in
your region, because
let’s face it: alcohol + piracy + global warming
+ smacking children + not recycling + lollipop
ladies + taking two penny sweets and only
paying for one penny sweet = terrorism
Pisces
That itch? Get it
sorted. NOW. Here’s
2 ccs of Shut Up
Solution – take it
now and come back
a week later and I’ll
administer you with some Silence Solution.
Swallow this: it’ll sort out that horrible rash
all over your face. What do you mean it’s not a
rash? Oh. Well, here’s the number of the finest
surgeon this side of the Mekong Delta. Tell
him your affliction and he’ll rip you up.

Aquarius
The doctor shoves

your throat, causing
you to gag quite
violently. After a
brief and sarcastic apology, Dr McGough peels
off his name badge revealing his true identity:
Dr Wibblechunder! DUN DUN DUUUN! The
worm inside you is forced deeper and deeper
until your big toe becomes a third (some
might say fourth! ZOMG!) eye.
