Winter sports, without hurt

People spend hours of winter recrea-
tion time on activities ranging from
sledding, snow-skiing and tobog-
ganing to ice hockey, ice skating and
snow boarding. However, if the proper
precautions are not taken to ensure
warmth and safety, severe injuries can
occur. This article focuses on skiing
and snow boarding.
Winter sports injuries get a lot of
attention at hospital A&E’s, doctor’s
surgeries and clinics. Injuries include
sprains, strains, dislocations and frac-
tures. At this time of year injury clinics
usually report high numbers of winter
sports-related injuries. For example
one practising physiotherapist men-
tioned that in the past she had noted
that out of 20 patients who came in
with a knee injury, 19 were likely to
have been caused by a winter sport.
However, it was also reported that the
majority of these were actually caused
by other skiers/snow boarders losing
control and colliding with them! So be
warned - you can take all the follow-
ing precautions but at the end of the
day, winter sports are dangerous so
you should always be prepared for any
eventuality, especially oncoming skier
traffic!!
The most common winter sports
injuries are sprains and strains. That’s
because your muscles never complete-
ly warm up and cold muscles are more
prone to injury. Skiing and snowboard-
ing both place heavy demand on the
knees, ankles, and feet and these are the
three most common areas for sprains.
Many winter sports injuries happen at
the end of the day, when people over-
exert themselves to finish that one last
run before allowing themselves to in-
dulge in the après ski activities. The
majority of these injuries can easily be
prevented if participants prepare for
their sport by keeping in good physical
condition, staying alert and stopping
when they are tired or in pain.
Follow these tips for preventing win-
ter sports injuries:
Keep in shape and condition mus-
cles before taking part in winter
activities
Pre-training should include aerobic
exercise to ensure fitness levels can
cope with the intensity during winter
sport participation. Make sure you
also include a resistance routine to
strengthen the muscles in advance of
the daily work out they’ll be getting.
The best thing to do is book in for a
sports specific personal programme
at the gym. You should expect to cov-
er squats, lunges, core conditioning
and flexibility. As well as having pro-
grammes of differing intensity set up
for you on the CV equipment.
Warm up thoroughly before starting
out. Cold muscles, tendons and liga-
ments are vulnerable to injury.
Just because you are off on a sport-
ing holiday does not mean basic proce-
dures you would automatically include
in a gym session should be removed.
By the way, wearing heavy duty winter
attire does not constitute a full warm
up!
Wear appropriate protective gear,
including goggles, helmets, gloves
and padding.
Invest in a lesson or two
If you’re new to the sport (swallow
your pride if this is necessary) take
a lesson from a qualified instructor
before you get started. You will have
a much more enjoyable trip (sorry,
hopefully you won’t be tripping any-
where) if you take the opportunity to
learn the ropes first. Learning how to
fall correctly and safely can reduce the
risk of injury.
Wear several layers of light, loose
and water- and wind-resistant cloth-
ing for warmth and protection.
Layering allows you to accommodate
your body’s constantly changing tem-
perature. Wear proper footwear that
provides warmth and dryness, as well
as ample ankle support.
Pay attention to warnings about up-
coming storms and severe drops in
temperature to ensure safety.
No amount of fitness training will
ensure you survive a night in a snow
hole!! Although warm clothing will
help!
Seek shelter and medical attention
immediately if you, or anyone with
you, is experiencing hypothermia or
frostbite.
Drink plenty of water before, during
and after activities.
Again, do what you would normally
do in the gym (those of you who don’t
hydrate during work outs ignore the
‘normal’ comment).
Avoid alcohol consumption.
Skiing and snowboarding do not mix
well with alcohol or drugs. Beware of
medicines or drugs that impair the
senses or make you drowsy. You can
still drink alcohol, just not at the same
time, which would be tricky anyway!
Avoid participating in sports when
you are in pain or exhausted.
If you’re tired, stop and rest. Fatigue
is a risk factor for injuries. Take this
opportunity to watch others, maybe
pick up some tips/ideas to try later, and
enjoy other aspects of the trip such as
socialising!
Winter sports are a whole lot of fun
and wouldn’t you be annoyed if you had
to sit the season/holiday out because
you sustained an injury? Be smart and
be ready for a season of adventure and
fun and leave the injuries to someone
else. Whether you are skiing or snow-
boarding, or participating in any other
winter sports these common winter
sports injuries can be avoided, well
some of the time! Good luck.

Hi there. Just dropping in to say that
the last four weeks have posed me
a real Di-Emma. Get it? That’s what
happens to you when you play with
words as a hobby. Oh well – long live
the competition!
Incidentally, this week’s winners
weren’t Di-Emma I’m afraid. The lucky
winner pulled out of the hat this week
was in fact a group of friends by the
collective name: The New Jiggers!
Congratulations! Keep those entries
coming in everyone.
Enoch
