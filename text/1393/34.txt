Play against Chuck Norris (and lose)
C
huck Norris went to uni-
versity to get a degree
in Chuck Norris. Chuck
Norris is unsatisfied.
Chuck Norris is back to
get with the young ladies, so beware.
Just the other day his good friend The
Hoff was telling Chuck that back in his
day, there used to be an IC Virgins club,
but The Hoff took care of that. Speak-
ing of virgins, did you know that Chuck
Norris once visited The Virgin Islands?
Yeah, they’re now called The Islands.
That’s right, 52 degrees are not
enough for Chuck. The 27th degree he
received for counting to infinity (the
29th for counting to infinity again),
and the 38th because he knows the last
number of π.
As some of you may or may not
know, Felix use Macs in their office,
which always poses a problem for
Chuck because his computer doesn’t
have a control button. He is always
in control. These Macs not only have
a control button, but the alt key is in
the wrong place. By the way, Apple pay
Chuck Norris 99 pence every time he
listens to a song off iTunes.
Chuck Norris heard there’s a Science
Challenge on. He was going to enter,
but then he remembered how when
he was in middle school, his English
teacher set him an essay titled “What
is Carnage?” Chuck wrote his name on
the page and got an A+. Speaking of
challenges, tarded is what you become
when you challenge Chuck Norris. Re-
tarded is what happens if you live to try
it again.
Did you know that Chuck Norris
is the reason that Wally is hiding? If
you can spot him somewhere in this
newspaper before 3pm on Friday, you
will get you a 10 point head start in
CNUT.
Chuck was very pleased by the car-
nage on Wednesday night in the Union,
especially the amount of vomit in the
toilets. Chuck Norris was displeased
by the toilet paper though. This is what
Chuck Norris uses:
Time to go drink more beer. Chuck
has a second year biology test in im-
munology tomorrow, but on his last
test, he put down “violence” as every
one of the answers and aced the test.
Chuck Norris solves all his problems
with violence. The blood test is anoth-
er test that Chuck Norris always aces.
Coffee Break is back. Hoff’s gone, Chuck’s in meaning there’s even more opportunities to get your ass kicked
Coffee Break
with Chuck Norris
Oh sweet, sweet CNUT
Welcome to the first issue of CNUT
(the Chuck Norris Ultimate Trivia).
If you think you’re better than Chuck
Norris (you’re not, not only can Chuck
Norris divide by zero, but he can count
to 20 using only 12 numbers), have a
go.
Chuck Norris has taken the role of
the lead actors in some famous mov-
ies. Seven points for guessing the
movie correctly, and another five if you
can name the character Chuck Norris
is playing.
Answers that make Chuck Nor-
ris chuckle with glee will also get you
points (but not quite as many as the
right answer).
Send your answers with your team
name to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk or texts
to 07864076057 if you’re in a lecture
theatre or not bothered to email.
First team to reply gets a bonus five
points just for being awesome. The
team with the most points at the end
of the year will receive a super duper
roundhouse kick in the face from
Chuck Norris himself (just kidding,
there is an actual awesome prize for
the winning team, and maybe even the
runners up, depending on interest). As
this is the first week and it’s more of an
interest-gauge, most are pretty easy,
but since you’re not as good as Chuck
Norris, I’ll give you a hint: two of these
are from the same movie. Also, don’t
forget to look for Wally. He’s hiding
somewhere in this newspaper.
To finish off: a fireman runs into a
classroom holding a screwdriver and
shouts: “This is not a drill!”
