Musical Theatre Weekly –
The Little Shop of Horrors
History
L
ittle Shop of Horrors is
based on the 1960 Roger
Corman B movie of the
same name. He did it as
a little weekend project
on some left over set. It didn’t seem
to do that well but obviously some
people thought it had potential.
Alan Menken and Howards Ashman
(the guys who reinvented the Disney
movie – they did all those early 90s
ones we grew up with, you know…
Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast…)
chose the story as the subject of their
first musical.
Little Shop of Horrors was the
show that started the revival in mu-
sical comedy that can be seen even
now by shows such as Avenue Q (go
see it!) but also dared to use darker
themes and black comedy. It also
utilised other musical styles such
as those of the American doo-woop
groups and rock and roll.
The show had its off-Broadway
debut in 1982 but didn’t make it to
Broadway until the 2003 revival. The
film of the musical came out in 1986
starring Rick Moranis (that geek
from Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk
the Kids…) and Ellen Greene (she’s Sy-
lar’s mum in Heroes!). The first London
revival of the show recently finished at
the Ambassador’s Theatre.
Main Characters:
Seymour Krelborn: A loveable geek
who likes plants and Audrey
Audrey: A ditzy blonde whose go-
ing out with Orin but secretly loves
Seymour
Audrey II: A cannibalistic plant that
sounds like Barry White
Mr Mushnik: Mean-spirited plant
shop owner
Orin Scrivello: Sadistic dentist, who’s
really mean to girlfriend Audrey
The Urchins: Funky Greek chorus
named after girl groups of the sixties
Plot
Seymour Krelborn is a down-and-out
orphan living on Skid Row. He’s a bit
geeky and social inept (aren’t we all?
Hang on, I’m at Imperial, perhaps I
shouldn’t answer that). He works for
the mean Mr Mushnik in his plant
shop and spends most of his days cre-
ating new plants and lusting after the
beautiful but ditzy Audrey.
The shop is about to go out of busi-
ness when Seymour discovers a new
plant during a full moon: Audrey II.
Unfortunately the only way for Audrey
II to survive is to drink blood (oops!)
Poor Seymour has to become more
and more criminal to keep up Audrey
II’s addiction, including having to kill
a few people. I won’t give away who
though, as that would spoil the story!
Songs to look out for:
Skid Row: Omg I love this song so
much. If you like overlapping harmo-
nies you’ll love it too.
Feed me: Funky ass “rock-off” between
a geek and a plant – gotta love it!
Suddenly Seymour: Ok, personally I
don’t like Ellen Greene’s voice, but it’s
such a sweet song
Where can I get it?
The DVD is really cheap; just make
sure you get the 1986 version. The
London revival is going on tour next
year. Perhaps you could go see it in the
vacation break!
If you liked this, try:
Enchanted: the new Disney movie:
because both feature music by Alan
Menken!
Hairspray: It’s got the whole sixties
thang going on. You know you’ll love
it.

Well, what else can you do when there’s a giant man-eating plant
but stand there looking desperately sexy?
How to... Get out of your house and
enjoy all that London has to offer
Rosie Grayburn would like to give you all a metaphorical kick up the backside... in a nice way, of course
I
have been putting this off for
a while in anticipation of bet-
ter weather and for Christmas-
sy things to get out of the way.
Seeing as our ‘monsoon’ season
has halted temporarily, I feel this is the
time to put forward my case in favour
of the Great British Day Out.
This series of articles aims to tear
you away from the telly and to get you
exploring in and around this great and
ancient City. You deserve a break once
in a while!
You’re right there, Grayburn.
Now, where do I start?
The ‘Day Out’ can be ap-
proached in many ways. The
meek and timid human spe-
cies may prefer to follow guide
books or crowds. On the opposite
end of the spectrum, there are uber
adventurous types who will hop on
random buses and hop off at ran-
dom locations.
Other methods include get-
ting a tube map and playing
‘Mornington Crescent’ or the very
popular ‘Find the 266 bus’. The latter is
not recommended as it requires a high
level of skill and it is extremely time-
consuming.
Sarcasm won’t get you anywhere.
Really, where’s the best place to
start?
Time Out magazine has up-to-date
events diaries and their website (http://
www.timeout.com/london/) is equally
good. Also, check out www.london-
freelist.com which has extensive lists
of events and places that are free, or
less than £3.
Good point. I’m pretty broke – I
spent my entire loan on sex,
drugs and drink. Oh, and blow
and hookers. Bugger.
Days Out don’t have to be expensive.
Buses are cheaper than chips and walk-
ing around always does you some good!
Make sure you enjoy the free things
in life. Use the above website. Most
museums and galleries are free in
London except for some special
exhibitions.
Unfortunately, some venues in
London are out to leech all the cash
they can from unsuspecting tour-
ists, so utilise your student card to
get a small discount. If they aren’t
advertising a discount, ask for it! It is
your right as a poor student to ac-
cept free/discounted things at
the drop of a hat.
Yey! (bounces around the page
like a little girl)
Next week we will introduce the South
Bank to you REAL ‘Days Out’ virgins.
Have you been somewhere cool and
groovy (baby) lately? If so, please tell us
about it and we will put it into a handy
guide for your fellow students. Get in
touch: arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk and
do something useful today! These kidlets are out having fun in London – why aren’t you? We promise the shorts are optional
