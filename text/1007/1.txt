Imperial To Merge With NHLI
BY MICHAEL L I l)L\M
AND ANDREW TSENG
The proposed merger with the
National Heart, and Lung Institute
with Imperial College is due, to go
ahead within a year. What is
described as an "affiliated rela-
tionship" between the two estab-
lishments is planned to start this
autumn. The amalgamation is the
first phase of a plan to make
Imperial College a medical super-
school.
In the second phase, if is
expected that, St. Mary's will
merge with Charing Cross
Westminster Medical School and
the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School to create one large medical
school at Imperial College. This
second phase is due to start, is
1996. The Basic Medical School,
to be built on the site, of the old
Chemistry building, will hopefully
absorb some these facilities onto
one site. Joint admission by the
two undergraduate medical
schools to the South Kensington
campus is expected to start, in
1997 or 1998. A merger with the
Institute for Cancer Research is
also being discussed although this
will be more difficult, as the
Institute receives much of its
money from charity.
Implant: Imperial acquires a new organ
There are seen to be four
advantages widi a merger. Firstly
a larger school would be able to
attract, bigger grants and carry out
better research than the smaller
institutions could themselves.
Secondly that the education of
Postgraduates, but, particularly
Undergraduates will be improved.
The current intake for St. Mary's
is small for future London medical
schools, increasing the numbers
wordd hopefully help it survive
into the next, century. Imperial
College will also play a part in
helping to prepare doctors for the
expanding field of medical tech-
nology. Thirdly administrative
costs will be reduced and lastly
that patient care will be improved.
Some rationalisation is
expected so that the most can be
gained from this merger. It, is seen
as necessary to make the, new
medical school as attractive as
possible, in the light, of present
government policy that is threat-
ening some London teaching hos-
pitals with closure. The medical
school that these proposals would
create would be of "world size and
world quality, something to which
none of the individual components
could separately aspire."
At, present it is unclear how
exactly the plans will pan out, but
it is clear that Imperial College is
extremely serious about expand-
ing its medical capabilities.

Superleague
BY JOE MCFADDEN
Imperial College is one of an elite
group of universities who are
planning to form a 'premier
league'.
About. 10 top universities -
known collectively as the Russell
Group - have been discussing
ways to protect, their research con-
tracts in the face of increasing
competition for funds from 'new'
universities. Ideas under consider-
ation include breaking away from
national pay bargaining so they
can offer higher salaries to attract
top staff, and opposing plans by
the, Government to share out lim-
ited research funding more evenly
with former polytechnics.
