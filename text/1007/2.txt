RCS Pot Lost and Found
BY ANDY S1NHARAY
"3.H.P. Missing, feared snatched
by Guilds!" was the headline that
screamed out at readers of the
Royal College of Science's (RCS)
newspaper, Broadsheet. The
Three I landled Pot, known affec-
tionately as 3.H.P. went, missing
on Sunday 2nd, but was found
eight days later.
Mr Charlie Bell, President, of
the RCS Union, said that one
attempt to remove the pot. had
been thwarted by RCS members.
However, later in the, evening it.
disappeared, apparently without,
trace.
Usually kept in the Union
bar, 3.H.P. has been in RCS pos-
session since the mid-sixties.
Engraved with the names of RCS
executive, members past and pre-
sent, it was originally believed to
have been stolen by members of
the City & Guilds College Union
(C&GCU), despite there being
what was described as "a strong
[Royal School of] Mines presence"
on the evening of its disappear-
ance.
Charlie Bell said he had con-
sulted both Fiona Grandison and
Vinod Fernandez - Presidents of
the C & G C U and RSM Union
(RSMU) respectively. The RSMU
President located the missing
tankard in the Mines Office. It.
was the morning of Monday 10th
when he returned it. to the Union
bar, safe and sound.
"I'm glad we got it back,"
said the RCSU president, but. he
stressed that that the Three
Handled Pot is not. a mascot, and
therefore exempt from the usual
rigours of mascotry. "Any future
theft will be regarded as such,
and will be dealt with according-
ly." He added, "it's worth a lot. in
terms of sentimental value to the
RCSU... to whoever borrowed it,
thanks for the sleepless nights,
guys."
Newsagent Nirvana

BY REBECCA MILE HAM
Sales of canned drinks from
Union outlets, doubled in a suc-
cessful first week's trading at.
Imperial College's newsagent.
"I think people, may be com-
ing into the newsagent rather
than going to the JCR" says man-
ager Jill Gibbons, a view con-
firmed by students emerging from
the newsagent with their purchas-
es.
"I used to go to the JCR, but
it shuts at 4.30", says Nat Price, a
computing PhD student.
The Financial Times sold
over 70 copies a day under a new
scheme, which reduces its price to
15 pence, while all three issues of
Woman's Own sold on the first
day of opening. Of the tabloid
newspapers, previously unavail-
able in the bookshop, only the
Sun clocked up significant sales.
"It looks great," says Miguel
Santos, a second year computing
student who claimed to live on
chocolate. "You used to have to
go all the way round the book-
shop to get cigarettes and drinks".
As yet, few clubs and societies
have taken advantage of the
opportunity to order specialist,
magazines from the newsagent.
Smoked
Out!
BY DAVID COHEN
Freshers' week has proved that
the dope detecting fire alarms
work. A first, year student has
been heavily fined after being
caught taking illicit substances .
The incident, took place on
the Wednesday. Fire alarms were
set off in the Old Hostel of Beit
Hall. Security guards were alerted
to the source of the alarm and
promptly apprehended a student,
smoking marijuana. The student,
whose name remains confidential,
was cautioned and fined by the
warden of Beit Hall, Jon
Marangos. Dr Marangos would
not. comment on the incident.
Posters around Beit. Hall
have been put. up to reiterate the
fact, that the College smoke
alarms, though relatively insensi-
tive to tobacco smoke, are very
sensitive to most other forms of
smoke.
Superleague continues
RAGged
Tiddlywinks
BY ANDY S1N11ARAY
The Annual RAG Tiddlywinks
Down Oxford Street took place on
Saturday, raising nearly £400 for
ActionAid. The amount raised was
£200 down on last, year's figure,
RAG chair Ian Robertson said
that those, attending "collected
excellently...and had a great
time." Having four minibuses full
of participants (as well as using
RCS and BSM mascots Jez and
Clem) he said he would have pre-
ferred a better turnout, but was
optimistic that RAG's next event.
— Monopoly around London
would be better attended. Anyone
wishing to take part should attend
the RAG meeting on Friday,
immediately after the U G M
(which starts at 12) or they
should sign up at the event on
Saturday at 10am, at. the ICU
building.

Russell Group (named after the
London Hotel they meet in) are
Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial col-
lege, the London School of
Economics, University College
London, Manchester, Warwick,
Edinburgh and Birmingham.
Other universities are fearful
that, if the, Russell group decided to
'break away' and form a super-
league they would attract the best,
students and all die most lucrative
research contracts from both the
public and private sectors.
Sir David Williams, Vice-
Chanccllor of Cambridge Univer-
sity, insisted in an interview with
F E L I X there was 'nothing sinis-
ter' about the plans: 'there is no
super-league and none envis-
aged...we are an informal group
with similar interests, set up for
the protection of the research
strengths of leading universities.'
Members of the Russell Group also
point out. that funding for centres
of technological excellence must be
kept high if the UK is to compete
internationally.
Vice-chancellors from new
universities have reacted by form-
ing their own pressure group, to
guard against what they see as the
beginnings of a two-tier system.
They are concerned that, members
of the Russell Group super league
will be the only universities able to
afford the rising costs of research,
while the rest are forced to
become teaching-only institutions.
Clarifcation
FELIX would like to make clear that the damage caused to Da
Vinci's at, the beginning of term was not, the responsibility of Imperial
College staff. Imperial College staff were not involved at, any stage. The,
plumbing carried out in the Union building was undertaken by an
external contractor.
