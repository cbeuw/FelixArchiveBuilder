OSC Elections
Open letter to all International
Students,
Now that you've all more or
less settled down, you've listened
to all the welcoming speeches and
survived Fresher's Week, it's time
to get you informed about what
the OSC is and what it does to
keep you happy. OSC or
"Overseas Students' Committee"
deals with all the international stu-
dents of Imperial College (EC and
Occasional students included), it
organises events (Disco Night,
Cultural and Food Fairs,
International Week, International
Nite and more). For the freshers
and occasional students I shall
explain that "International Nite" is
the largest event of Imperial
College that occurs in the second
term and attracts more than a
thousand spectators every year. It
includes cultural shows and dis-
plays of various countries, food
fairs, disco, live bands and more
fun than you could possibly imag-
ine.
Apart from organising events
the OSC also takes active part in
all Union decisions, protects and
promotes the interests of interna-
tional students in the College and
finances the running of all the indi-
vidual national societies.
Naturally, all this takes a lot of
work, and many more people than
just the members of the executive
committee take part voluntarily.
However, due to unforeseen
circumstances during the elections
last term, the executive committee
has not been formed in full, there-
fore there will be new elections on
Wednesday 1 9th October in the
Union Concert Hall (2nd floor
Union Building) at 1 pm for the
posts that have been left empty.
Anyone can stand, fresher to post-
graduate, as long as he or she has
one proposer and five seconders.
The name of the candidate, the
post, as well as the names of the
proposer and seconders should be
written on the candidate papers
that have been put up in the
Walkway and the Union building.
The papers will come down on
Tuesday 18th at 2pm. Each pro-
poser will have the right to speak
for three minutes and each candi-
date will be able to give a short
speech for five minutes. In order to
vote or stand, you have to have
your swipe card (or some other
form of College ID) with you.
It is essential that every foreign
student comes at least to vote,
because it's your committee deal-
ing with your interests and prob-
lems and you wouldn't want the
wrong people to take the decisions
for you...

Hmmmm, that finished in the nick
of time Andreas. Good luck with
the elections...
Confusion
Dear Felix,
Let me tell you about what hap-
pened on the night of Wednesday
the 5th of this month. A few of my
friends and I had decided just after
ten o'clock, to see if all the events
at the Union had finished yet. We
had heard that there would be a
hypnotist, and wrongly thought
that once he had gone, entry
would be free. However, on enter-
ing the archway, our esteemed
President informed us that we
could only stand in the Quad, if we
didn't pay £3 to get into the Union
proper. Having more sense than a
stunned lemming, we decided that,
while an hour and a half of board
games would be amusing, we did
not want to pay £3 for the privi-
lege. And so she grudgingly let us
stay in the Quad while muttering
that we should "Get a life".
So, while a friend already there
got drinks from inside the Union,
we sat outside drinking, not taking
part in the disco (which, at the
time, had all the life of a dead
sloth on Valium), or the board-
games. And this seemed as rea-
sonable to us as the ICU people at
the doors of the Union to whom
we were in full view. But, in an act
of incoherence brought on, we
speculate, because it was her
'Time Of The Month', she declared
us a security risk and ordered us
removed from the Quad. Which
was strange, since when we got to
the archway, the doorman seemed
to think that it was perfectly within
the rules for people to stand in the
Quad of their Union. But our all
knowing President stated otherwise
and ordered our drinks be confis-
cated and that we be kicked out.
To this day, we still do not know
whether it was the kindness in her
heart, her generous personality,
the doubt on the face of the door-
man, or the fact that we were four
1 9/20 year olds who had imbibed
alcohol that made her relent and
let us down our drinks before we
were forced to leave.
And what is the point of all
this? It was no skin off our collec-
tive nose since we ended up hav-
ing quite a good time at our
friend's flat dancing the night away
while laying into his collection of
booze. The point is, if the Union
wants us to cough up pound coins
and notes to get into the Union, it
should provide something that's
worth it. I would gladly have paid
a fiver to see the hypnotist, but £3
for board games?

Glyph is Sad?
Dear Owain,
Quite an impressive start to the
year, issue 1006 had news, fea-
tures and only 7 pages of ads, and
what an interesting piece by
Glyph. Still I guess that many peo-
ple didn't get past the first column
of his diatribe and so didn't endure
the continued rantings of this twist-
ed soul.
Well I read the whole page, I
read it twice in fact, the reason
being initially I had no idea what
the piece was about, but gradually
it dawned on me. First he slagged
off the "anorak brigade", whatever
that is, then he touched lightly on
overseas students before descend-
ing upon rugby players and such
like. Not only did he try to put
down the beer drinking males of
IC, he also had a go at the women
too, which apparently are fat,
bearded and bigoted, yet it would
appear that the author is perhaps
more bigoted than his subjects.
This is backed up by his next
attack, this time on Rag. No origi-
nality here either, as he, like
everyone before him who chose to
put down Rag covered his back by
saying that "collecting money for
charity is a reasonable past time",
well this is exactly what Rag does
so his argument seems a little con-
fusing. However, a little further lies
the real reason for his comments
on Rag as he mentions that "the
Edited this week by
Owain Bennallack
last two rag chairs have been les-
bians". What, are they no longer
lesbians? Were they only gay for
their time as Rag chair? So the
message obviously is - don't do
Rag, it'll turn you homosexual. This
is, however, not true, as there
have been recorded cases of
unashamed heterosexuality in Rag
for many years.
Well then it's on to drugs and
how no-one is wistful and enig-
matic, they're just pricks, whereas
he etc...(?).
But he hadn't finished. Just a
quick blast at people in relation-
ships, which is apparently a fate
worse than death. However he
implies that if you're not in a rela-
tionship then people will wonder if
you're gay. Funny that, I would
have thought that people would
assume you were gay if you were
in a relationship, but just with
someone of the same sex.
Yet now we come across the
real message in this article... beat
the system by going out with
someone from the outside world.
Not a Star Trek fan, an overseas
student, rugby player, beer
drinker, Raggie (they're all gay), or
"drugs prick". Hey, but what does
that leave you with, why, yes of
course, Glyph, the man who put
pen to paper in such a wonderful
caring way. But it looks like the
page long lonely hearts ad has
failed as he forgot to put a tele-
phone or box number at the bot-
tom of the page. So all the inno-
cent freshers who were so
impressed by his literary talents
are going to have to settle for a
beer drinking, rugby playing
Raggie, or similar. I don't know
why the article was titled "The
Docker's Fist", but I'm sure Glyph
will get to know his fists quite well
as they become his only friends,
after all he is an IC male and obvi-
ously really quite dull.
Thanks,

The feedback has been pretty fair
on this article: we've had some say-
ing how good it is and a few
loathing it to pieces. I have to play
Mr Democrat, but thanks Helen for
a reasonably coherent response
rather than a "you printed that
scum?!?!" My line is going to be
'free speech' in all these issues...
