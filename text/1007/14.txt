Lay Down The Law with ICSF
On Tuesday 18th October, IC
Science Fiction Society will be
showingRobocop 3 in die Concert
Hall, Union Building at 7pm.
Although it doesn't quite match
the brilliance of Robocop, it cer-
tainly beats the first sequel as
seems to be the way with film
trilogies.
Packed with big guns, big
explosions, Arnie style one-liners,
crazed revolutionaries and clone
robot ninjas there's something for
everyone here as Robocop (not
played by Peter Weller this time,
though you can hardly tell) joins
the uprising against OCP, gains a
surrogate family (well, the crazed
revolutionaries) and goes for a
spin in a jet pack.
Admission isJust £1.50 to IC
Science Fiction Society members
(membership being £3 including
yourfirstfilmfreeplus access to
our library of over three thousand
books and videos) and£2 to non
members.

Dribblers 'Hammered' by USA
Cobham (American Community School) vs. IC Dribblers (11-1)
The ladies' football team had a
friendly match against an
American School, on Saturday. We
had only just signed some people
on from the Fresher's Fair. Early
on Saturday morning we set out
to Cobham and eventually found
the ground, but we were early as
for some reason the A3 road works
did not hold us up! So, we went
back up die motorway and had
lots of breakfast. Eventually, we
started the match. Completely
new players in a completely new
team! We held out well for fifteen
minutes or so, but they then got
two in. We pulled one back, but
then their four times-a-week
training paid off and they com-
pletely hammered us in the sec-
ond half, in the unusual heat.
However, it. was a great display of
effort and will on our behalf. We
should have a good season ahead
of us! Thanks to all those who
played, even the 'old girls'!
FilmSoc: Four Weddings
and a Funeral
The film that emerged from
obscurity to take the world by
storm, arrives at ICU Cinema on
Wednesday at 8pm. As well as
breaking numerous records this
film has also broke a few hearts
along the way. I high Grant's stir-
ring performance and naked sex-
ual charisma has been responsible
for "wooing", what seems like the
entire female community. The
male audience will be more than
content with the elegant charms
of Andie MacDowell. The four
happy occasions are split by the
unfortunate death of one of the
group. However this lighthearted
trip is bound to have you killing
yourself with laughter.

Exotic: All wrapped up for the icy cold waters of... the Queen's Lawn.
An Underwater Experience
Why learn to dive? Why not, was
my thought this time last year as I
contemplated joining the Imperial
College Underwater Club
(I.C.U.C.). To be truthful, the
thought of going underwater for
any period of time longer than 30
seconds did bring me out into a
cold sweat. So why did I join
I.C.U.C? Because I had seen pho-
tographs of people diving in exotic
locations all over the world, and I
wanted to do the same. Also it is
relatively cheap to learn at college.
Good enough reasons, so in I
plunged in - literally.
The course consisted of a lec-
ture every week and a practical
lesson in the pool every two weeks
(sometimes, if lucky, every week)
for the first two terms. The lec-
tures covered diving safety, equip-
ment, use of decompression
tables, and different types of div-
ing (night diving, wreck diving,
drift diving). The pool sessions
begin with snorkelling. It wasn't
long before we were using an
aqualung, which to my pleasant
surprise worked — yes, you can
breathe underwater.
Finally, after all the lectures
and pool sessions, you're ready for
your first open water dive. By this
time you're feeling confident and
you just can't wait to get in the
water. And what an experience it
is. Especially when you see your
first, wreck.
This year I went on weekend
dive trips to Swanage/Weymouth,
Liltlehampton, Cover (Wales) and
Plymouth. Each dive trip consist-
ed of leaving as early as possible
on Friday and returning late
Sunday evening. Diving takes
place all day Saturday and all day
Sunday. Everyone usually has two
dives on both days. The first dive,
probably being a wreck dive and
the second a scenic dive. The
evenings consist of food, beer,
more beer, and if you really want,
more beer.
So, if you have any inclina-
tion to dive, don't hesitate, come
along and give it a try. I can guar-
antee you will have no regrets.
The training programme
starts Tuesday, IHlh October,
6.30pm in W2/W3just inside Beit
Arch. Ifyou bringyour swimming
gear, you can liy aqualung that
evening (fi-eef). Any questions,
please contact Douglas Donaldson
on ext. 48237 or on email
did@doc.ic.ac.uk, or Ian Russell
