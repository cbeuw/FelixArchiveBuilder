Yeah there were bands, six in
total. Some people got on down,
and others just moshed. The
highlights? Well it. must have been
Salad even alter their dodgy start.

Monday. What with the all-girl
support band, Frantic Spiders,
and the photogenic Marijne
singing for Salad, someone
somewhere was doing their best
to raise the frustrated hormone
levels of IC's male population to
even higher planes. Mission
accomplished!
As for the music, well they
recovered from a shaky start to
carve out some almost,
memorable, upbeat indie toons,
made all the more palatable with
the odd keyboard wash and some
state of the art crooning. And with
song titles like 'Elegy in B minor
for the dying swan' can we really
criticise?
Headed by a crafted lead
guitarist blessed with the shy wit
of the streets, the Frantic
Spiders crashed through tempos,
stopping and starting, weaving
tunes. When she said "if any of
you fancy any of us, you have to
talk to the drummer" there were
laddish cries from the assembled
lads until - "but one of us is
married and the other two aren't,
that way inclined". One lad
shouted back "it doesn't matter to
me", but we knew that he was
out of it. Haaha, not only were
they good they were unavailable.

Quite what this word meant no-one was quite sure until the time came
to glide onto the floor, partner in hand. There were just enough women
to go round thanks to the transforming powers of the dramsoc dressing
up box and make-up facilities. Amazing what a couple of 15 stone rugby
players can be turned into.
