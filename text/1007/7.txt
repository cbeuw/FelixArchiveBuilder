DOC HARRISON SOUNDS THE ALARM
MORE EQUAL ACCESS?
Netculture is infill rating mainstream culture like an
accelerating juggernaut: cautious at first, but. utterly
unstoppable once moving. The Internet in 1994: wel-
come to a 100 mph screaming turbo-charged 18-
whecler! In the first of our special reports, the S-Files
unlocks the internet, at IC, and demands access for all.
Over the past four years, the S-Files have watched while the net
awoke. Phis year, it has reached critical mass. With over 20 million peo-
ple on-line and a growth rate of 10 percent per month, the jump into
non-proprietary, virtual culture represents one of the largest mass-
migrations since WWII, wildly outstripping its plain, simple beginnings.
You were hoping to come to a nice, technical university where you
would learn about maths,
physics, biology, whatever, in "i
the cool, calm comfort of a
cloistered college. Right?
Wrong! You're switched on by
technology, popular culture, his-
tory, art, people, travel, London,
language and the future.
Log on. Join us.

Isn't the Internet all just a lot of hype?
If we think that we're one of the fore
most technological universities in the
the world and you wanted to know about
opportunities in, say, the Rock Mechanics
research group here at Imperial, you could try
phoning or emailing, but you might not. know
the right person to contact. It. would be much
better to simply rustle up (TloSdlcQQ and start
browsing. At the moment, you
wouldn't, find anything.

The Internet is like a shop window. The

needs to be involved, the computer centre
needs to be involved. I don't see why we

Aren't there a lot of fears that the Internet
will cause problems?
I don't think we can afford to wait for commit-
