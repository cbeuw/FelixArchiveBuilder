Frater liam
Writes
It would seem that the anal reten-
tives have a g a i n put their foot
down in an attempt to remove the
fumigating minions from the JCR.
Your Frater observes with pleasure
the fact that those who choose to
inhale nicotine have ignored the
petty signs and continue to follow
their will. Smoking may be haz-
ardous, but only an imbecile could
deny its benefits. N i c o t i n e , that
c u r e r of c o l o n i c c a n c e r , that
expander of mental capacity, that
bringer of pleasure, is a chemical
which brings aid to an enlightened
m a n y a n d only afflicts those of
mean intolerance. "Smoking is an
art form", once saith 'Random', an
occasional associate of mine. He
g l o r i f i e d it as an aspect of the
sculpture that was his life, and its
dangers were merely an inherent
part of that aestheticism. Oft would
he curl the delicate tube of a ciga-
rette around his fingers to show me
its beauty.
T h o s e w h o w h i n e a b o u t
addiction are equally misguided.
Addiction is the fairest of delights,
without which life would collapse
into the most deadening banality.
The Frater's own life consists mere-
ly of a l o o s e - k n o t t e d string of
obsessive needs, the highest of
which is the glorious correspon-
dence with the G u a r d i a n A . For
those who wish to avoid the 1000
pollutants that a c c o m p a n y their
nicotine fix, I would heartily recom-
m e n d p a t c h e s , n a s a l sprays or
aubergines, which contain a suffi-
cient concentration of the intoxin.
The Frater himself is under-
going a period of ritual preparative
asceticism, for which he had been
obliged to deny his need for the
cigarette. But such abstention, or
'giving up' as it is appropriately
dubbed, is not necessarily a good
thing. Don Juan warned Castaneda
that abstention is merely self indul-
g e n c e - That is a statement that
should be contemplated for some
time.
The more astute among my
readers may have noted the subtle
alteration in my title. The unfortu-
nate typo of the previous w e e k
cunningly shifted its cabalistic sig-
nificance. Such mysterious changes
could be avoided by instilling com-
puters w i t h a s e n s e of the
Qabalah: an idea suggested to me
by a m a t h e m a t i c a l g e n i u s with
w h o m I h a d the f o r t u n e to be
acquainted. He suggested that it
may also be a route to achieving
A.I.
POLITICAL
SCIENCE
My thesis is very simple: Imperial
produces 'well behaved engineers'.
Let me explain the vocabulary first.
'Well behaved', is an adjective that
indicates a particular attitude to
w o r k i n g on a p r o c e s s . A w e l l
b e h a v e d e n g i n e e r w o r k s o n a
process, going from start to finish,
without thinking about the wider
consequences of the process.
I s u p p o s e the m e a n i n g of
being well behaved comes from
the difference between the words
'academic' and 'intellectual', which
are not equivalent. More specifical-
ly, well behaved engineers are not
a w a r e of what s c i e n c e d o e s to
society. The ability of science to
alter the structure of society within
5 0 - 1 0 0 years is awesome: robots
have replaced entire communities
of work forces; the car has altered
the way Western society thinks and
f u n c t i o n s ; c o n t r a c e p t i v e s h a v e
given w o m e n a large degree of
f r e e d o m . A n d yet the g r a d u a t e
who comes out from Imperial is not
aware of these issues. He does not
know what sociological effect his
science has. W h e t h e r this igno-
rance c o m e s f r o m not b e i n g
taught, or whether it is because the
engineer is deliberately ignoring
the other, 'wider' issues is another
question. Imperial College's prod-
ucts, its graduates, are enamoured
with the idea of technology. They
are rigid in the belief of science as
an end in itself.
W h y a r e t h e s e e n g i n e e r s
well behaved? Why are they acad-
e m i c g e n u i s e s a n d intellectual
b u f f o o n s ? The m a i n r e a s o n , I
think, is the way in which the engi-
neers are taught. The engineer
works with 'nice' theories. Theories
which have premises, conclusions,
reasons, a n s w e r s , connections,
measurements. (This is the scien-
tific culture that Kuhn talks about.)
T h e r e are two p o i n t s to m a k e
about such a training. Firstly, the
student is not taught about science
in some context at all. 'Humanities'
courses are a rarity. Courses cover-
ing the philosophy and history of
science should be compulsory first
year o n e s , not a d d e d on as an
after thought.
S e c o n d l y the student has
been trained, brain washed even,
to work with objects that fit into a
scientific s c h e m a . To be m a d e
aware of any bad effects of the
entire structure would cause him to
question his very existence! The
w a y out of this d i l e m m a is to
ignore anything that lies outside
the schema.
Of c o u r s e , b e i n g w e l l
behaved suits the market: Industry
requires well behaved engineers;
Imperial produces them. Imperial
requires funds; Industry produces
them. But such a link, an implicit
link, w o u l d serve all parties
involved: Imperial gets finance and
students; Industry gets products
and labour; graduates get jobs.
Everyone wins?
