1974), Sir Ralph Robins
(Chairman of Rolls-Royce pic),
Professor Abdns Salam (Professor
of Theoretical Physics at, IC 1957-
1993), Professor Roger Sargent
(Head of the Department of
Chemical Engineering at Imperial,
1975-1989 and Director of the
Centre for Process Systems
Engineering, 1989-1992) and Dr

Barter Bypass
Local Exchange Trading Schemes
(Lets), the cashless barter schemes
that operate across the country,
have reportedly begun to target
Britain's first year students at
events like Freshers' Fair.
A directory lists the services
members can provide and the
work they do is collected on a
central computer. Running totals
keep track of 'credit and debt' but
unlike some major high street
banks there is no charge for
becoming overdrawn. Services can
be nearly anything, from window
cleaning to saxophone playing.
Students remaining with the
conventional loans system face
bleak statistics. According the the
NUS they can hope to graduate
with around £8000 of debts
(Sunday Telegraph, 9/10/94).
Succession
Professor David Southwood,
(Professor in the Space and
Atmospheric Physics Group) has
replaced Professor Blow as the
head of the physics department.
Professor Blow, who was also
Professor of Biophysics, retired on
the 30th September 1994.
He had been at the helm for
18 years, from 1976-1994.
Travel to Israel
Candidates arc invited to apply for
one of the 1995 Bessy Emanuel
Educational Trust, Israel Travel
Grants. The bursaries, worth up to
£500, are provided to students
interested in undertaking a
personal project, in Israel. These
could such things as studies of
ethnic communities, eduction of
gifted children or the care of the
aged in the, kibbutz.
Candidates are invited to
submit a brief outline of their
project idea by February 1 1995.
Those interested can obtain
application forms from John D A
Levy, Academic Study Group, 25
Lyndale Avenue, London, NW2
2QB. Tel: 0171 435 6803.
Flat Update
Several kind readers have
managed to bypass the heavily
doctored photograph hurdle
above to recognise me and to
enquire, as to how my domestic
life (Re: Issue 1005) is going. Well,
we have, managed to move into a
flat, that, (we believe) is actually
owned by our landlord. It is a
converted 'hotel' (Calcutta style)
with two bathrooms, at least one
of which works at any time. We
are living in the Polynesian style,
with low beds and furniture. In
fact, the furniture is a door based
arrangement and our clothing is
placed in vertical piles in a 'Last,
In First, Out' queuing system. (We
have no drawers but, boy do we
have good acoustics).
We also have a nice space in
the kitchen for a fridge, currently
located in another space,
unknown, and our old friend who
had lodged himself in America has
returned to bargain the rent,
down, swap rooms and move into
the FELIX office.
Flats: Can't live in them,
can't squat without: them.
Postcards from Nowhercsville
Could Anna of Biology please
come into F E L I X and confirm
her authorship of two letters I
received this week. All letters must
be brought to the FELIX office
with a Swipe card, by the author,
as unfortunately there have, been
cases of fraud in the past.
Best a brick in the face?
I went to the anti Criminal Justice
Bill march on Sunday, shortly
before it turned into a club 18-30
smash-and-scream shopping trip
down Oxford street. Basically, we
saw something bad going down
and so we got out of there. Fifteen
minutes earlier I had read a
communist leaflet telling me to tell
the pacifists to 'push off and all
along Piccadilly black clad figures
with scarves wrapped around
their mouths had scarpered in rat
like packs. There were clearly
elements out to cause trouble
(cither that or they were highly
susceptible to traffic fumes...)
I hate the Criminal Justice
Bill on many levels and I thought
too that I hated the police, or at
least the concept of a police force
(although at a Trafalgar Square,
mini-riot I almost vomited to see
one booted in the head five, feet
from my feet). But this summer I
visited Paris and saw thousands of
the French Police line the roads
for a tourist procession, gun on
hip and snarl on face. I saw the
anti-terrorist units in packs of six
kick in a fruit, stall in a Metro
station screaming abuse and I've
seen a British constable, stand in a
road surrounded by people
screaming 'Kill the Bill', unarmed
and patient. So I don't hate them
anymore.
The point of this long winded
intra? After the, march/riot (believe
the press or the police) people
were saying 'the police just,
charged in' and 'they came in
huge numbers'. They talk about
the police starting the trouble
when generally I think it is that
the police are simply the first, to
have to make a decision. Despite
the undeniable miscarriages of
humanity that have been
perpetrated by the police, the fact
is that they will be the first, ones to
risk injury in any situation. One
docs not generally feel on the
point of being assaulted when
walking in a demo, but they
continually face that, threat
unarmed and in smaller numbers.
In many countries, people dressed
in terrorist, garb and masked
would be shot on sight, not left to
sit planning on the steps of
fashion stores. The police, have to
go in en masse when they do: if I
had men and women doing their
job and threatened with severe
violence under my command I'd
be tempted to send the tanks in.
The police don't make the
laws: the government, you and
me do (by actions or inactions)
and no-one deserves to take a
beating for another mans laws.
Constitution
So today sees the first submission
of the new constitution to a UGM,
a body it. seeks to make near
extinct. My feelings are mixed. On
the one hand I mourn the passing
of regular UGM's (which just a
few years ago attracted many
hundreds of students) and I doubt
the ability of SRC to achieve the
necessary level of 'openess' and
communication. I dislike the
argument, that, the officers sitting
on it actually represent, the
students their position denotes
and if that is true then some are
more represented than others (eg.
a female in hall who plays hockey
and dances vs. a studious scholar).
On the other hand I've been
trying to get people to read a copy
of the constitution that has been
on the F E L I X front desk all
week. No-one has. What choice do
we have?
The UGM is at 12:30pm in
Biology W2 and W3, Beit Arch.
