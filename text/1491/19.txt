F
elix is throwing another
rocking party at Imperial
College Union’s live music
venue and all around super-
club, Metric, on Saturday
11th June.
Following the success of the first Fe-
lix Music Night - 19.02 - we bring you
the most anticipated sequel of the Sum-
mer: BONED. Come gaze in awe at
our incredible roster of Imperial-based
musicians from Jazz n’ Rock and Music
Tech, who will perform for you along
with our very special guest, Becoming
Real.
The line-up for the night is an exciting
one, only rivaled by the line-up we had
for the original Felix Music Night.
Special guest
BECOMING REAL
(Ghost-Step)
Alongside James Blake and Mount
Kimbie, Becoming Real is defining
the landscape of post-dubstep British
electronic music, and we are extremely
proud to have him perform at the Felix
Music Night. If you are looking for the
future sound of London’s nightlife, look
no further than this brilliant artist. Do
not miss it! His unique live performance
is unlike any other ‘dance’ artist you wil
see this side of Venus.

... And you could play too!
Are you in a band? Or are you an ama-
teur beat poet? We are still looking for
one last act, so give us a shout if you
want to take part in BONED!
We have purposely incorporated many
eclectic musical styles in a single night,
so as to appeal to as many tastes as pos-
sible, but we assure you it all fits togeth-
er just right. Each set will be kept short
and sweet, and the set-up times in be-
tween acts will be minimal, giving you
a real bang for your buck.
It is to be a celebration of our local
musical scene and an opportunity to
bond with other music-lovers, share a
drink and make new acquaintances. We
want this to be a cross-society bonanza
of tasty vibes and sweet music.
If you have ever strolled into Imperial
Union on a Jazz n’ Rock jam night,
chances are you’ve been paralyzed by
the sight of Inescapable Fate’s mem-
bers tearing shit up with an admirable
disregard for authorized decibel levels.
Inescapable Fate (IF) is Imperial’s
foremost death metal band, and they
will get the place they deserve in the
limelight at BONED, the second Felix
Music Night, taking place at Metric
on Saturday 11th June. We spoke to
IF about their story and their perfor-
mance.
Who are you guys?
IF: We’re a four-piece outfit: Kiran
plays drums, Sean takes bass and
vocals and Laurie and Will play guitar.
How did IF get started?
IF: Laurie and Sean first played togeth-
er at a barbecue in 2006, covering ‘For
Whom The Bell Tolls’. After that, Kiran
joined them and Inescapable Fate was
born. After seeing the band live at a Jazz
and Rock event, during which perfor-
mance several fans were nearly ejected
from dB’s just for enjoying the show a
bit too much, Will was invited to join
the band, and the lineup was complete.
How would you describe your music?
IF: It’s a good mix of thrash and death
metal – we try to keep it catchy enough
that everyone can enjoy it, whilst mak-
ing sure that no-one can understand
what Sean is saying.
What are some of your influences?
Laurie: There are too many to name,
but the likes of Carcass, Cave In, En-
tombed, At The Gates and The Smiths
are as good as any.
Sean: For my bass playing it’d be
Steve Harris, Cliff Burton, Martin
Mendez and Marcus Miller. For vo-
cals, I’m a big fan of Tomas Lindberg,
Mikael Akerfeldt, Jeff Walker and
Randy Blythe.
Will: It’s tough to say, since I’ve listened
to so much over the years. I like most
things – anything from Judas Priest and
Ozzy to Queen, or from Sting to Dream
Theater or Opeth – it’s all good. Most
recently however, I’ve really gotten into
the “djent’’ movement: bands such as
TesseracT and Monuments. It’s basical-
ly what happens when you mix groove
with metal.
Why do you believe there’s still a
place for metal in modern music?
IF: Metal is an extremely adaptable
genre that combines aggression, melody
and sheer volume with a cornucopia of
different (and sometimes unexpected)
influences to produce rich and varied
music with few boundaries. And every-
one loves a good mosh.
What is the best live performance
you’ve ever seen?
Laurie: Bolt Thrower at ULU in 2010.
Classic West Midlands death metal. Bo-
nus points for doing the “death’’ voice
even between songs.
Sean: Iron Maiden at Twickenham Sta-
dium in 2008.
Will: It’s not all about how fast you can
play, but I do tend to enjoy the more
technical gigs. I recently saw Symphony
X play at Scala and it was phenomenal.
Their talent is difficult to replicate on a
good day, but they were playing above
tempo and really working the crowd. It
was fantastic.
Why do you think people should
come see you play?
IF: Because we’re passionate about our
music and aim to put on a loud, energet-
ic, and entertaining live show that can
be enjoyed by metalheads and anyone
with an open mind towards music.
Now all you have to do is come along
and support Inescapable Fate as they
rock the living crap out of BONED.
Most importantly though, come and
headbang your heart out.
Inescapable Fate are bringing the noise to BONED... in a big way

So that’s 3 bands and 5 DJs: a total of
8 incredible acts, playing all night long
for your listening pleasure, and all for a
mere £3. Seriously, what more can you
ask for?
We chose the date specifically be-
cause the vast majority of you will have
finished your exams, so there is no ex-
cuse for not turning up to a night of fun,
kick-ass tunes and great performances.
Bring all your friends and their friends:
the event is open to everyone, not just
for Imperial students. This is the last
showcase of Imperial’s musical talent
this year, and it is set to be a spectacle of
epic proportions.
Come one, come all, to BONED at Met-
ric on Saturday 11th June 2011.
A statement by Operation Mid-
night Climax:
In the 1950s, the CIA spiked
unconsenting individuals with
LSD in whorehouses across
the U.S. Now, we’re not saying
we’re going to drug you or vio-
late your civil liberties. We will,
however, blow your mind with
the sheer ecstasy of progres-
sive ska music. Let midnight
come so our bodies may unite.
