BUSINESS
I
f you are a young, aspiring en-
trepreneur, with an idea that will
earn you millions (or at least
enough money to pay for drinks
on a night out), you are likely
to eventually receive a speech from an
older, more experienced entrepreneur
on the importance of writing a business
plan. A business plan describes the busi-
ness, its objectives, its strategies and its
market, allowing you, the entrepreneur,
to give answers to the questions you are
bound to have.
Is it profitable? What am I risking?
Do I really believe in this or is it just
another excuse to avoid revision? The
research involved in writing up a busi-
ness plan will allow you to give a realis-
tic, objective answer to these questions,
and will allow you to spot problems and
work on them before they escalate or
before any investment is made.
Business plans should start with a
persuasive summary that entices the
reader to take the plan seriously and
move ahead with it. Investors, who read
business plans every day, will be able
to tell whether a business might have a
future or not just by reading the open-
ing paragraph.
Next, you will have to write a de-
tailed description about your product or
service. It is important for the reader to
thoroughly understand the product you
are planning to offer or the service you
are planning to provide. At the same
time, do not overwhelm the reader with
technical explanations or words that he
or she may not be familiar with (you
never know, maybe they went to UCL).
Make sure you also discuss any barriers
that you face in bringing the product to
the market, from development costs to
possible legal issues.
Once you have explained how awe-
some your product is going to be, you
have to talk about your target market.
You have to convincingly explain who
you are aiming your product at and why
those people will want to buy it. It will
also allow you to evaluate whether the
market you are aiming for is big enough
to actually generate a profit; a product
that improves the lives of Mech Eng
students at Imperial might help your
friends but is unlikely to land much
money in your pockets. This section
of the plan is extremely important, be-
cause if there is no need or desire for
your product or service there will not

be any customers. If a business has no
customers, there is no business. This
part of your plan establishes whether
your idea is just a fun project or an ac-
tual business from which you can make
serious money.
Once you have identified what your
market is, you will need to explain your
strategy for reaching it and distributing
your product or service. Potential in-
vestors will look at this section careful-
ly to make sure there is a viable method
to reach the target market identified
at a cost that does not jeopardize your
potential for profits. Developing an in-
novative marketing plan could play a
large part in your success, as investors
look favourably upon creative strate-
gies that will put your product or ser-
vice in front of potential customers.
Another important part of the busi-
ness plan is the part where you show
that you understand who your competi-
tion is, and what its strengths and weak-
nesses are. You need to give arguments
for why there is room for another player
in the market, and why you think your
product would be chosen by customers
over your competitorâ€™s.
No matter how good your product or
service, it is very likely that someone is
already offering something similar, so
it is crucial that you explain why yours
is better. Find flaws in the competition,
and explain what your product has that
prevents it from having those same
defects.
Now that you have had an opportu-
nity to really sell your idea and wow
potential investors, the next question
on their mind is what you need in order
to get it on the market. What resources
and processes are necessary to get the
product to market? How much capital
is needed for launch and what are the
various upkeep costs?
If the goal of your business plan is
to obtain financing, you will need to
generate financial forecasts. The fore-
casts demonstrate the need for funds
and, more importantly, why the inves-
tor would rather give the money to you
than spend it on a new car or a bathtub
filled with champagne (you can now
see why your arguments must be very,
very convincing).
Finally, end your plan by discussing
long term growth plans for your prod-
uct. Once you have triumphantly con-
quered your first customer segment,
how will you grow your business?
What new market or product will you
develop that will allow you to further
increase the now obscene amount of
money you (hopefully) have?
Once your business plan is complet-
ed, you will have a much more realistic
idea of what your business is and what
it could grow to become. Your business
plan should be constantly developed
and improved together with your idea,
and once you are swimming in your
pool of money you will be grateful for
having spent those few hours planning
your business rather than improvising it
on the spot. Or revising.
It never fails...
