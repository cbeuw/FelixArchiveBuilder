COMMENT
I
t’s late. My eyes are red from fear
and concentration. The only light
in the room comes from my desk
lamp as I burn the midnight oil,
stooped over my desk. The floor
around me is littered with scrumpled
wads of paper. Discarded ideas. Each
one would have worked, they would
have worked fine. But fine isn’t good
enough – this has to be perfect. My girl-
friend’s birthday is coming up and ev-
erything must go just right.
I’ve been at this for fourteen hours
now. Maybe the alternative, to close my
eyes tight and hope everything works
out alright is also an option. Perhaps
the best way is to be found in a happy
compromise, as a famous soldier of for-
tune often declared, “I love it when a
plan comes together.” But I find it hard
to agree with Mr Hannibal; by combin-
ing spontaneity with precision of fore-
thought, I fear we risk losing the best
parts of these different strategies.
For example, the first method of
meticulous planning is, admittedly, a
lot of work. The best strategists lose
countless nights of sleep as they toss
and turn worrying over the smallest de-

people are less sure, things are gener-

as long as we control enough of the vari-
ables, we can control the outcome. To a
large extent this is true, so long as we’re
not working with atoms. Or anything
made of atoms. We may have a slight
problem.
Conversely, the issue with the hands-
off approach is not one of control but
responsibility. You can’t sit back and
let things happen by themselves if you
weren’t in a position to control things
to begin with. You are still responsible
for the consequences. If things eventu-
ally go tits-up (which there is a strong
probability for them to do), people will
invariably come to you for answers. In
this scenario, it is wise to either have a)
a good explanation or b) a better escape
plan. If you only ever plan one thing,
make sure it’s this one – always have a
get-out clause.
Maybe I will just let things unfold...

and five-past with flowers in hand.

tails. However, this effort and anxiety
is rewarded when it comes off without
a hitch. The moment when everything
comes to fruition in perfect harmony
can only be compared to watching all
the gears, cogs and sprockets of a most
marvelous watch click into place for the
first time. It’s beautiful.
This euphoria is lost when you sit
back and let things unfold around you.
However, this method lacks the agonis-
ing hours of hard work and worry – a
decidedly stress-free experience. That
in itself is a plus. Consequently, though
it is not guaranteed, there is a small but
real chance that, without external inter-
ference, everything will come together.
If a perfect plan realised is like a watch
in perfect metre, then when things sim-
ply work is like watching as a million
parts are thrown together at random –
yet produces a watch that reads the ex-
act time. Certainly unexpected but not
unwelcome.
A problem with the planned approach
is that it offers us the illusion of con-
trol. The majority of motorway acci-
dents occur during the day, when people
think they are in control. At night, when
T
wo years ago, on a January
afternoon, an Israeli shell
hit Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish’s
home in Gaza, killing three
of his daughters and his
niece. Nothing can replace the hole left
in his life by that shell. Yet the Harvard
educated gynaecologist stood in front of
the Imperial College Israeli Society in
March and proclaimed that “good deeds,
wisdom and good works” were the only
weapons he wanted. His war wasn’t
against those who took his daughters
away, but with himself. “Hate”, he said,
“hate was my greatest enemy. I knew I
would only drown in it; I had to look
beyond”.
This was one of the most affecting
and inspiring events I have ever attend-
ed at this college. The calm prose of this
bereaved father confers a soft eutha-
nasia on the anger of armchair Hamas
supporters, who too often dominate the
Israel-Palestine debate in this country.
“We must understand the radicals, and
show them compassion. It is for each
individual to understand that justice for
them can only come from justice for the
other side.”
Abuelaish’s call for an abandon-
ment of “labels” and an acceptance of
“human, universal values” resonates
across all conflict areas. How curious,
and telling, that from apartheid South
Africa to Troubles-ridden Northern
Ireland, it is those who have lost the
most who refuse to return eye for eye.
Abuelaish’s daughter is blind in one eye
and has had to learn to write with her
left hand, the right paralysed. But after
seeing her struggle, and succeed, he has
determined to provide scholarships for
young girls, both Palestinian and Israeli,
to complete their education. This Nobel
Peace Prize nominee’s story provides
hope for those despairing that Gaza is
stuck in a spiral of revenge.
In refusing to bow to ideology,
Abuelaish stands for the revolution that
isn’t summed up in a slogan or fought
with guns, but humbly grounded in hu-
man experience and waged in the heart.
His belief that honest experience should
be placed before ideology stands in
stark contrast to the suicide bomber or
soldier who values his own life and that
of his victims less than some principle.
“The most Holy thing in the world”,
Abuelaish told his audience, “is human
freedom”.
At the start of the Easter break, a
Catholic police officer was killed by
dissident republicans in my home coun-
try of Northern Ireland. In the past, an
attack like this would be followed by
revenge attack after revenge attack. But
this Easter was different. Politicians
from all parties attended the funeral. For
some, this was the first Catholic mass
they had ever attended. The parents of
the dead officer were unequivocal in
their response; this death must be the
last.
Mercifully, none of us is ever likely to
be called upon to express quite the same
degree of forgiveness and compassion
as Dr Abuelaish or the parents of PC
Kerr but the same spirit can inform the
way we live our daily lives.
For two weeks from the 8th June, the
Chaplaincy will host an exhibition enti-
tled “Forgiveness” in Sherfield. Featur-
ing photographs of people from conflict
zones all over the world, from Northern
Ireland to South Africa, covering people
of all religious faiths and none, the ex-
hibition will be a powerful testimony
to forgiveness. All are very welcome to
attend.
Although he is a devout Muslim, I
hope Dr Abuelaish wouldn’t mind my
expressing the core of his belief with a
quote from the atheist and existential-
ist philosopher Albert Camus, discuss-
ing the search for an absolute ideology;
“What need had I of so many efforts?
The soft lines of these hills, and the
hand of evening on this troubled heart,
teach me much more”.
So the news that our Cheryl
has been fired from American
X-Factor has left us feeling
saddened and betrayed.
Solution? Suck up:
Dear the America,
Please keep Cheryl Cole.
Please.
Um, who?
Good question, I’m not entire-
ly sure what she is famous for
but still she’s cute and you
like accents and stuff, so
keep her in your X-Factor?
Hmm, we do like Scooby Doo
and X Factor does seem to be
lacking in that je ne sais quoi...
It ain’t got nothing on your
British shows, like the Made
In Chelsea and the Geordie
Shore. They are like California,
only sexier. Ok, we’ll keep the
Cherry.
Cheryl. Actually since you
mention Geordie Shore, she
is in fact from Newcastle.
We love the castles. The Brit-
ish castles are awesome. In-
ternets says she was in band
called Girls Aloud. We have
something similar – Pussycat
Dolls. Then we realised that
hot dancing girls who don’t
sing are just hot dancing girls
so now we have the Nicole
Scherzinger.
By jove, Lewis Hamilton’s girl-
friend! It’s a small world, isn’t
it?
Who?
International racing driver?
International? You mean like
the World Series.
The what?
Like the Superbowl for
baseball.
Yeah we have that too, we
call it rounders. Who knew
we had so much in common?
Yeah, like OMG.
As overheard by Alex Nowbar
Dear USA: You
can keep Cheryl
Cole
