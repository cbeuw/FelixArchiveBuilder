Glee: It‚Äôs time to start believing
Matt Allinson relented, watched the damned show, and found out he liked it
A
lthough difficult to ex-
plain in purely logical
terms, especially when
one takes into account
the stratospheric amount
of money produced by this show, its
world tour, album sales and branded
lunchbox tie-ins, I think that Glee is
underrated. Undoubtedly if you haven‚Äôt
already stopped reading this article it‚Äôs
safe to assume that your eyebrows are
raised so high right now they‚Äôd be shot
down over Libya, so allow me to justify
such an outrageous claim.
Straight off the bat I feel the need
to declare that I live with two women,
women who watch videos of kittens on
the internet and insist on the flat having
weird things like fluffy cushions, blan-
kets on the sofa, and a clean shower.
Furthermore, my beloved girlfriend is
an active member of Imperial‚Äôs fantastic
Financial Times pointed out, it makes
good financial sense to appeal to teenag-
ers who feel like outsiders. It also makes
good financial sense to produce brilliant
pop music, so by combining both, Glee
is on to a total winner.
All the above can be confidently
stated without seeing a single minute
of the show, but what took me by sur-
prise and pulled me into the show was
the little-commented-on fantastic sense
of humour. Sue Sylvester, the cheer-
leading coach bent on the destruction
of the Glee club, is the best example
of a comedy arch-nemesis character on
television at the moment. The rate at
which the scriptwriters have attempted
to include story lines about every single
aspect of teenage life, coupled with the
fact that the show has to fit in at least
3 full-length musical numbers, leaves
Glee with a plot about as subtle as
Pippa Middleton‚Äôs arse. However the
frantic pace of the show adds breath-
lessness to the comedy which makes it
funnier, helped by some expert timing
from the all-singing and dancing cast.
So yeah it‚Äôs auto-tuned in places and is
single-handedly responsible for Journey
reforming and bringing out a new al-
bum, two crimes which it takes a lot to
compensate for. However through sheer
hilarity coupled with pure old-fashioned
sing-a-long and a story so unashamedly
feel-good that it actually makes you
feel good, Glee somehow manages to
pull everyone along in its appeal. I‚Äôm
no diehard ‚ÄúGleek‚Äù, and have no inten-
tion of rushing off to buy the DVDs and
tickets for the live show, however in the
likely event that it‚Äôs on in my flat, I‚Äôll
watch it and have a good time; and if
you haven‚Äôt seen it yet I recommend
you give it a try.
Musical Theatre Society, and as a result
it was only a matter of time before I was
exposed to the most potent piece of com-
mercial entertainment of the decade. As
