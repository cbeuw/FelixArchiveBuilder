Imperial cuts CaSE subscription

in winning concessions for researchers
in the government’s immigration strat-
egy.
CaSE director Imran Khan, an Impe-
rial alumnus, said that it was not for
him to judge the College’s decision,
but expressed his frustration that Impe-
rial had not expressed any prior dissat-
isfaction with CaSE’s efforts: “What’s
frustrating for us is that it hasn’t been
conveyed to us if there are specific
things they feel we’ve got wrong, or
have not delivered on. All the direct
feedback has been positive, which
makes their departure all the more puz-
zling.”
An Imperial spokesperson said that
Imperial regularly reviews its sub-
scriptions to “ensure they compliment
and add value to the College’s activi-
ties” and that it was felt that the sub-
scription fee could be “better directed
to support Imperial’s core activities.”
Imperial declined to say who had
made the decision or if there was any-
thing specific about CaSE that Impe-
rial was unhappy with, however the
spokesperson did say that they con-
tinue to support the group’s “aims and
objectives.”
The Times Higher Education maga-
zine has reported Imperial’s subscrip-
tion to be £3,000, a sum that Mr Khan
declined to confirm or deny, except to
say that it “isn’t far off.” CaSE’s mem-
bership fees range between £1,000 and
£5,000 per year.
Imperial receives the most research
funding from public sources of any uni-
versity in the UK except Oxford Uni-
versity, which it ties with. In 2009/2010
it received almost £100 million in re-
search council grants and reported a
total annual surplus of around £40 mil-
lion.
Jonathan Adams is the security officer
who chased down and caught a campus
thief last week. He has worked at Imperial
for the past ten months and modestly said
that his efforts were a “team effort”, call-
ing it “a positive outcome for security.”

Imperial joins £600 million
medical research centre project
Imperial and King’s College London
are set to become involved in the con-
struction and development of a London-
based ‘world-leading’ medical research
centre, the Francis Crick Institute.
Currently being built at Somers
Town in North London, the institute
will bring together researchers from
its academic partners and its founding
research institutes, which include the
MRC National Institute for Medical
Research (NIMR) and the Cancer
Research UK London Research
Institute (LRI).
Opening in 2015, the overall goal
of the centre is the prevention and
treatment of various diseases, including
cancers and influenza. Having signed
a Memorandum of Understanding in
April, thereby signifying their desire to
join with the current partners, Imperial
and King’s are now each contributing
£40 million to the project, matching the
amount from founding academic partner
University College London.
With a founding investment of £600
million, the scheme has received
support from Parliament in a recently
published report, but concerns have also
been raised with regards to the location
of the project.
Published on the 25th May, the
Commons Science and Technology
Committee concluded an investigation
into the proposed location by praising
the “strong case for locating the institute
close to leading hospitals and academic
institutions” before considering that
there may be a “premium to be paid for
locating the institute in central London”,
citing higher costs and in particular the
notion that the location of the institute
will reinforce the concentration of life
sciences in the “golden triangle” in the
south-east of England.
The Institute’s response to the report
has, in turn, been largely positive.
“We are pleased the MPs on the
Science and Technology Committee
have described [the Francis Crick
Institute] as impressive and clearly
in the public interest. We particularly
welcome their conclusion that the
two existing London-based institutes
The centre will be based near St Pancras International

Matt Colvin
(NIMR and LRI) which are joining [the
Institute] should be located alongside
universities and hospitals and good
transport links. This is a key part of the
vision for the institute and fundamental
to its success.”
In response to the criticism over
the location of the Institute, CEO and
Director of the Francis Crick Institute
Paul Nurse reinforced the importance
of its intended location, arguing that
it is “at the heart of an immensely
powerful cluster of academic and
medical institutions.”
He also praised London as “an
international magnet for the highest
quality staff from the UK and
overseas”, that will prove advantageous
in the institute’s aims to “attract future
scientific leaders”.
