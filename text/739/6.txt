Dairy farmers.
The problem with B G H is
that it works too well.
According to the Journal of
Dairy Science, injecting
cows with the hormone
over a long period leads to
'a remarkable increase in
milk production', up to 41%
more milk. But the cows
also eat more. Feed
effiency goes up by 15%.
In the 1970s Genentech,
the US Biotechnology
company, spliced B G H into
E coli (A bacterium usually
found in the human large
The US dairy industry has
become so productive that
cattle are having to be sent
from the dairy to the
slaughter-house for meat
packing. The US Office of
Technology Assessment
predicts that dairy output,
which has been rising by
about 2.6% a year for the
last 20 years, will increase
by 3.9% a year through the
introduction of new
technology.
In particular there is
bovine growth hormone

worldwide market for the
hormone is estimated at
about $1 billion (£650

that 90% of New York dairy
farmers will us the drug

down milk prices even
more, and reduce the

evfci further.
B L ! the farmers will have
to make sure that the cattle
do not graze on tall fescue,
a common forage grass in
the US, or they may
contract fescue
foot—which can lead to
gangrene—or summer
syndrome, with weight loss,
increased temperature and
respiration, and roughened
coats.
These conditions are
caused by ergot alkaloids,
produced by a fungus that
infects the fescue. The
fungus seems to produce
the alkaloid more
effienciently when nitrogen
fertilizers are present.
Ergot alkaloids also
affect man. In the past, rye
has been infected with
ergot, and a condition
known as St Anthony's Fire
resulted. This has very
similar symptoms to those
produced by the
hallucinogen LSD.
Baldness Cure
A new baldness cure,
from the Upjohn
pharmaceutical company,
has performed well in
clinical tests in the US. Of
the 619 patients who
completed a recent test,
26% rated their hair growth
as moderate after four
months. After eight months
the figure rose to 36%, and
after a year it was 40%, by
which time 8% described
their hair growth as 'dense'.
The scientists running
the study said that 76% of
patients had grown non-
vellus (normal) hair after 12
months. The study also
showed that 65% of
patients enjoyed a
reduction in the size of
their bald patch.
Much the commonest
kind of baldness arises not
from shedding hair, but
from a change in its
character. In baldness, the
adult hair follicles regress
and instead of producing
normal hair produce vellus
or baby hair, which gives
bald heads a velvety look.
Until now it has been
thought that the changes is
irreversible.
Upjohn has filed an
application with the FDA
for approval of the
baldness cure, and is
already constructing plants
in Michigan and Belguim to
produce the drug when
approved.
The cure may be of
considerable interest to a
certain ex-president of
Imperial College Union
(namely S D Goulder Esq)
and a certain S C A B
chairman (namely N
Shackley Esq).
Black Hole Discovered
Astronomers have
recently come up with the
most likely black hole
candidate yet. It is the X-
ray transient known as
A0620-00 (Nature, 321, 1
May 1986, 16) X-ray
transients are a sort of X-
ray binary systems,
consisting of a faint red
star and an attracting
compact object (for
example, a black hole).
They are transient because
they only emit X-rays for
relatively short periods,
which recur over timescales
of years.
Astronqmers J E
McClintock and R A
Remillard have been able to
determine the radial
•elocity curve of the red
star to the dense object by
measuring the periodic
Doppler shift of its
absorption lines. The
amplitude found was 457
km/s, very large for a
binary with such a short
period (only 8 hours). This
means that the dense
object must be at least 3.2
times as massive as the
sun. This is above the
maximum possible mass for
a neutron star: the object
must be a black hole. Or so
the theory goes.
It is no use the sceptical
arguing that A0620-00
might be a triple, rather
than a binary, by the way.
This argument does not
hold up given the small size
of the system implied by
the short 8-hour period.
