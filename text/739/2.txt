Charity
Anyone who looks at this
I week's Guildsheet will see
| an article on charity. The
I article was entitled 'Live
| Aid: Was It A Con'. This set
| me thinking—is charity a
I con? This year Rag will
I raise in the region of
I £15,000. To do this
I students will have
I
. humiliated themselves in
| every imaginable way. They
I will have embarrassed the
I College by producing a
| Rag Mag that bought the
| College large amounts of
I negative publicity.
An interesting fact: I was
I reading the other day that
1 world leprosy could be
I eradicated for £50 million,
I the price of one Phantom
1 jet. That means that the
I money IC Rag raises is
I 3
/ioooo of the money needed
| to eradicate leprosy. Don't
| get me wrong. I'm not
I criticising the amazing
I efforts of Rag Committee to
| get apathetic IC students
| involved. What I'm saying is
| charity stops people
| concentrating on the real
| solutions to the world
| problems. Even an amazing
| effort like Live Aid can only
| achieve a fraction of what
| could be achieved by a
! concerted effort from the
1 world's governments. If
| public opinion was such
.that governments were
|; forced to take the Third
World seriously hunger
|j could be eliminated. Next
|l time you donate to charity,
why don't you also write to
your MP encouraging him
to campaign for increased
and better aid to the Third
World?
St Marys
The proposed alliance with
St Mary's is a great
opportunity for Imperial
College. The academic
departments at St Marys
compliment rather than
duplicate those at Imperial.
Socially another group of
people (possibly another
C C U ) couldn't fail to
improve the social life.
Obviously it's difficult to
say much more than this as
very few of the details of
the proposed alliance have
become clear yet.

South Africa
Blues
Dear Hugh,
Congratulations to John
Martin for coining the
phrase 'ethnic socialism' to
describe the apartheid
system (FELIX 738). The
South African government
has been trying for years to
conjure up an innocent-
sounding description for a
system that denies black
South Africans all political
rights and power. Their
organisations are outlawed,
their protests brutally
suppressed and their
leaders are imprisoned,
tortured and occasionally
murdered by the security
forces. I think that a more
accurate description of a
system, whose military and
police drive around the
townships in unmarked
lorries and shoot dead
stone throwing kids, would
be 'a crime against
humanity', as described by
the UN.
As to Mr Martin's charge
that the A N C is a violent,
Marxist terrorist
organisation, how would he
describe a regime that has
launched countless military
attacks against its
neighbours (Lesotho,
Swaziland, Zimbabwe,
Botswana, Angola and
Mozambique), not to
mention its illegal
occupation by 100000
troops in Namibia. The
A N C is an organisation
whose constitution is based
on the Freedom Charter of
South Africa. The
document states that South
Africa belongs to the will of
the people, black and white
together, equals,
countrymen and brothers.
Surely Mr Martin, as a
guardian of democracy,
accepts that democracy
should be based on the will
of the majority of the
people and not just on the
few who are 'privileged'
enough to be born with a
white skin!
Finally, since we are in
the season of brain-teasing
questions, could Mr Martin
answer these few?
1) Which bank is the only
British high street bank
with a major stake in South
Africa, controlling 30% of
all banking there?
2) Which bank in South
Africa has assets in South
Africa that come to a
staggering £6 billion,
including £145 million in
government securities?
3) Which bank takes part in
massive loans to the South
African government and its
state corporations?
4) Which bank purchased
£6 million of Government
Defence bonds in South
Africa in 1976, but was
forced to sell them a year
later after a massive
international outcry?
5) The director of which
bank was a member of the
South African Defence
Advisory Board, which
advised the armed forces
on arms procurement, until
it was disbanded in 1982?
6) Which bank operates
branches in Namibia, on
South African army bases
and regularly advertises in
South African Defence
Force magazine?
7) Which bank has helped
finance arms sales to South
Africa (although the bank
says unknowingly), despite
an international arms
embargo?
8) Which bank plays a key
role in channelling profits
from Namibia to South
Africa?
9) Which bank sacked a
black employee after he
had put up a poster
commemorating the dead
of the 1960 Sharpville
massacre in which 69
unarmed blacks were shot
dead (the majority, in the
back!)?
10) Which bank insists that
its continued presence in
southern Africa is a
liberalising influence on the
apartheid regime, and is
beneficial to the black
community, although it has
been named by the UN as
one of the multi-nationals
making a 'substantial
contribution to apartheid'?
11) Need I go on....?
Yes, Mr Martin, B A R C L A Y S
National.
I think IC students
should be discouraged
from opening accounts
with a bank that is
financially supporting a
country whose constitution
is based on a system of
institutionalised racism. For
this reason, a motion
calling on the Union to
cease printing adverts has
been submitted (again) for
discussion at the A G M . I
hope you will come and
support the motion.
Yours etc.
