Cycling
It's been a busy few weeks
since Easter. In a 25 mile
T T in Essex, John Gilday
and Peter Hartigan did well
to beat the hour barrier.
We're all looking forward to
the National Student '25',
where we have 9
representatives in this
Oxford University
promotion.
At Eastway, the purpose-
built cycle circuit at
Stratford, E15, Peter
Hartigan and Scott Heyhoe
rode the 32 laps event in
the May Day meeting. In
wet and cold conditions
with several crashes on the
tricky circuit, Peter excelled
in gaining 8th place overall,
as well as winning one of
several 'Hot Spot Sprints'.
Don't forget the A G M !
Christian Union
As world terroism increases
and people search for
solutions it must be said
that independant of any
party political view volence
can never be repayed with
violence.
IT was wrong of Thatcher
and Reagan to retalliate
and bomb Libya and wrong
for any one to similarily
retalliate.
In Northern Ireland the
violence between supposed
Catholics and Protestants
is wrong. One can never
justify ones cause by
premeditated and
deliberate violence. In our
own lives how do we treat
those around us. We
cannot just blame politians
and leading figures for the
violence in society as we all
belong to society and are
therefore responsible for its
conduct whatever our views
and affiliations. I close with
Jesus words from his
teaching on love of
enemies (Matt 6vv 43-48) 'I
tell you love your enemies
and pray for those who
persecute you' If we all did
this the world would rapidly
become a better place to
live in.
Bookshop News
Hundred of bargains in our
annual booksale, academic
and general books, diaries
and calenders.
The window display for the
next three weeks will be
courtesy of John Wiley and
Sons publisher. All books
will be aimed at student level.
If you wish to see any book
ask any member of the
bookshop staff and they will
get it for you.
Any book recommended by
lecturers that you cannot
find in the shop tell me; it
so often happens that
lecturers tell you but not
the bookshop. Most English
publications can be got
quite quickly.
The Sportshop has a
wide range of Helly Hanson
jogging socks. T shirts,
both long and short
sleeved, and their new wet
weather jogging suit
comparable to the gortex
version but cheaper. A
selection of speedo
swimwear, towels and bags.
Hopefully by the time that
you read this we will have
in stock a range of Inter
Sportshoes plus squash,
badminton and tennis
rackets.
The new style
mountaineering club tie is
now available. Don't forget
club T-shirts to your design
•are in stock.
Continued from page 9.
I could only find one
Indian detective-whether
because there aren't any or
whether our shops just
don't stock them-and
anyway these books were
written by an Englishman.
In spite of the fact that H R
F Keating wrote nine of his
novels about Inspector
Ghote, an Indian police
detective, before he even
visited the sub-continent,
his books are surprisingly
full of details. I doubt that
Mr Keating has managed to
fully involve the
consciousness of an Indian
mind however and in .
Inspector Ghote draws a
line, the plot is similar to
the familiar English country
house (the butler did it)
mysteries.
In a family mansion a
retired Indian Judge Sir
Asif is receiving typed
death threats which imply
he will be killed for an
unpopular sentence of
hanging passed thirty years
oreviously. The only people
vho could have sent the
notes are his daughter,
Begum Rosham,
harbouring a grudge for
her father's prevention of
her marriage, Father Adam
an unlikely sounding
socialist Priest, Amand
Baba, a saintly Hindu
n;ystic, and the editor of a
(very) provincial
newspaper, The Sputnik,
Mr Dhebar. In this sense
the book is conventional;
its real interest lies in the
tensions it explores
between Raj and Indian,
Moslem and Hindu,
educated and uneducated,
landed class and aspiring
middle class, and
labourers, and men and
unemancipated women.
The book could have gone
Chinese anthologies in the
Haldane, which contain
novels to similar detective
stories but I have not yet
seen a Charlie Chan book.
Well, I hope that's
convinced you the
detective in fiction is not
tacky and cheapskate
unfortunately in fact the
modern detective is most
a lot deeper into these, but
remains rather superficial-
but a good try for a
W.A.S.P. author.
There are not many other
Asian detectives, a few
likely to be hanging round
seedy hotels trying to get
grounds for divorce
evidence. Alas an ignoble
decline of a once noble
profession. S arah Kirk.
