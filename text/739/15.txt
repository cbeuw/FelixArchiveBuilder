IC Win National Wine Competition
Imperial College Wine
Tasting Society won the
Peter Dominic Inter-
University Wine Tasting
competition for the second
year running at the Naval
and Military Club in
Piccadilly on April 30th.
Imperial beat Cambridge
(who were second), Exeter,
Edinburgh, Southampton
and Newcastle in the final.
Team members, Mark
Masento, Anthony
Broadbent, John Craven,
Keith Russel and Julian
Wilson, had to identify the
country, region, district,
grape, variety, vintage year,
name of wine and producer
for 4 white and 4 red wines.
Their individual scores
were then counted and
added together to give a
team score.
Mark Masento, IC
Captain, won the prize for
the highest individual score
in the competition, a bottle
The winning team
of Macallan Single Malt
1967. Each team member
received a Magnum of
Chateau Lafite-Rothchild
1982 (at present worth
£180).
Mr Masento said later
'Last year we just
competed, this year we
were the team to beat.' The
pressure was almost
unbearable especially as
the results were being
announced" a la Miss World
in reverse order. It was a
splendid team effort'.
UROP Swop
An exchange of students
under the Undergraduate
Research Opportunities
Programme (UROP)
scheme has been arranged
with the University of
Delaware, who run a similar
programme to our own.
The idea is that Delaware
students doing research
under the U R O P scheme
may work at Imperial
College and IC students
may work at Delaware
during the summer
vacation. This year is a trial
run and Delaware are
offering to take one student
'guinea pig'. We are taking
a Delaware student in
return.
The particular offer is for
a penultimate year student
in Physics or Electrical
Engineering to work with
Prof Allen M Barnett, who
leads a group whose
interests are solar cells and
heteroepitaxial silicon-
gallium arsenide devices
for optical
interconnections. He is
offering $1500 for 10
weeks' work. The student is
required to find his own
fare to the States but, just
to start things off, we are
offering £100 towards this
cost from U R O P funds.
Anyone interested should
contact Prof Anderson,
Electrical Engineering
Department, as soon as
possible.
Jobs For The Scientists
Colours Change
A motion concerning the
award of competitive
colours is to be put before
IC Union Council next
Monday. It is propsed to let
bodies other than the
Athletic Clubs Committee
award colours for success
in competitions. At present
acheivement in non-athletic
competitions, for example
wine-tasting, have been
acknowledged by the
award of social colours.
Women's Rep
The University of London
Union may appoint a
Women's Officer. A
constitutional change to
create this post is to be
discussed on the 3rd June.
Tim's Crash
Tim Palmer, Recreational
Clubs Committee
Chairman, sustained minor
injuries in a road accident
on Tuesday night. While
cycling along Fulham road
Mr Palmer was hit by a car
and flung over its bonnet.
He needed eight stitches.
Big Brother
Security cameras have
been installed in the
Sherfield Building. When
FELIX contacted security,
they were unable to say
why the cameras had been
installed as Mr Reeves, the
College Security Chief was
on holiday.
Dirty Washing
The Southside laundry is
likely to be out of action for
two weeks from next
Monday while the drains
are unblocked. Sources
claim that two weeks
closure is needed so that
workmen can dig up the
floor to get to the drains.
Iraqi Worries
Iraqi students at Imperial
College are worried that
they may be attacked by
supporters of the present
Iraqi regime. This follows
an attack on an Iraqi
student at UMIST. The Iraqi
students demand the
expulsion of the National
Union of Iraqi Students and
Youth, who they allege
have organised the attacks
on behalf of the Iraqi
Embassy. They also urge
the Home Office to
investigate the activities of
the Iraqi Embassy and to
provide protection for Iraqi
students opposed to the
Ba'ath dictatorship.
Science and Engineering
students are more likely to
be employed in industry
than their Art and Social
Science counterparts,
according to a poll
conducted by the Sunday
Times. 71% of the
companies surveyed last
December also support the
Government's.bid to
• increase the quality and
intake of science subjects.
The opinions of the
companies involved are
confirmed by the actual
figures for graduate
employment in the most
popular disciplines. Applied
Science and Engineering
lead convincingly with 88%
employment, followed by
Pure and Social Sciences
with 56% and 54%
respectively. Humanities
subjects trail at 39%.
Based on experience,
employers give priority to
Engineering, Science and
Computer Science coupled
with qualities such as
communication,
resourcefulness, initiative
and independence.
However, most are only
'fairly satisfied' with the
graduates they recruit. A
quarter of the employers
questioned regard
communications skills as
the ability most lacking
among graduate
employees.
NUS At IC
NUS President elect, Vicki Phillips, was at Imperial
College on Wednesday for a STOIC interview.
