Double Vision
Dear Sir,
Have any of your readers
noticed the extraordinary
similarity between Student
Counsellor Don Adlington
and Managing Surveyor
Peter Hallworth? I wonder
if they are by any chance
related?
Yours faithfully,
Aretha Franklin. Don Adlington Peter Hallworth
The Right
To Choose
Dear Hugh,
I was annoyed to read
the petition in issue 738
presumptuously signed 'the
students and staff of
Imperial College'
demanding that Waitrose
must stop stocking South
African produce. I was
further dismayed to read in
'Whats On' that there was
to be a demonstration on
Saturday outside
Sainsburys to 'persuade'
them to stop stocking
'South African fruit and
other goods'.
I am sure that most
reasonably minded
students at Imperial are
opposed to the apartheid
system. The difference in
opinion (as so elequently
expressed by Dunlop and
Martin!) is over the
question of whether
sanctions on South Africa
are constructive or not. In
this country we are,
thankfully, free to choose
our own view on the
matter. By the same token
we are free to choose
whether or not to buy
South African goods. Since
Wfeitrose and Sainsburys
still sell South African
produce it stands to reason
that there must still be a
demand, if reduced, for
them. If we want to buy
these goods we are free to
do so; if we don't, we don't
have to.
We students value our
individual right to make our
own choices. How can
these petitioners and
demonstrators cry out for
freedom and in the same
breath attempt to deprive
us of it.

Dear Hugh,
I was surprised when
reading the article on Star
Wars research in a FELIX
two weeks ago. My surprise
was due to fact that I find it
very hard to believe that
the Americans would invest
1 million dollars let along
20 million dollars in
Imperial, considering the
appaling state of our
security. Perhaps the
Americans don't know that
we have security guards
who are almost totally blind
and deaf, their age often
too damn old and the
number often far too small
to do the jobs set for them
properly. Anyone who
looks like a student can get
into just about any
department past the
security officer and if they
don't they just have to use
the tunnels. Shouldn't the
College be thinking of the
fact that a reasonable
percentage of any money
we get should be used to
increase security at least in
the areas concerned.
Yours
A concerned student.
