and retirement at 30.
Unfortunately Ms Duke and
Lord Sutch were both
remarkably unfunny. Both
candidates ran in Fulham in
an attempt to boost their
rather unsuccessful
showbiz careers. Ms Duke's
main claim to fame seems
to be that she appeared on
a Pepsi ad or another
equally boring and trite ad.
Lord Sutch's music career
had also been very
unsuccessful and he was to
be seen gigging at various
Fulham pubs during the
campaign.
The saddest type of
candidate are the genuine
candidates who have a
serious message for the
electorate but haven't got a
hope in hell of beating the
massive publicity machines
of the three main parties. (I
mean who wouldn't vote for
a party like the SDP who
were touring Fulham with a
van playing Boney M's
greatest hits). Boyd Black
of The Democratic Rights
for Northern Ireland Party
was running in an attempt
to persuade the main
political parties to
campaign in Northern
Ireland. He argues that the
British Government will
always be Labour,
Conservative and Alliance.
As these parties do not
campaign or nominate
candidates in Northern
Ireland, the Northern Irish
people cannot vote for their
government. Mr Black is
intelligent and articulate.
He admitted that he didn't
ever think he would get
elected, he was trying to
get some publicity for his
cause, he said. This he did
with well-attended public
meetings. He also got a
message of support for his
campaign from the winning
candidate.
Reginald Simmerson (All
Party Common Market
Group) was a former
Conservative councillor.
When he spoke to FELIX he
sounded like some ancient
country squire as he said
'you have to face facts, the
frogs don't like us. The
northern Europeans are
alright but frogs just don't
like us'. Mr Simmerson
believes that Britain must
leave the Common Market
as France and Italy take
advantage of Britain's
membership. He quotes
battles where we beat the
French which he feels left

the French hating us and

The Humanist Party, who
fielded Jon Swinden as
their candidate, are a new
party. Their policies are all
about devolving power to
the grass roots. They rely
on Gestetnered publicity to
get across their message of
increased participation by
youth in government.
Despite having a very
credible message that
should have appealed to
students etc, they hardly
polled any votes because
they only budgeted £750
for the campaign (which
included £500 lost deposit).
The final serious fringe
candidate was Geoffrey
Ralph (Fellowship Party)
who is a superintendent
minister of the
Hammersmith and Fulham
Methodist circuit.

in when FELIX phoned (it's

likely that it was because
he was campaigning
because nobody seemed to
see him during the
campaign) so I haven't a
clue what his policies are
but he was described by
another candidate as
feeling strongly about
things but being totally a y
incapable of
communicating his ideas.
These serious candidates j t k
all seem rather sad about * ™
the fact they didn't stand a
chance of winning. Several
of them said that they
might not stand again
because they'd had enough
of wasting money on a lost
cause. This seemed rather
a shame as they do give
the voters another choice.
As some of them have
stood in over ten by-
elections I'm sure they'll
keep going though.
Should fringe candidates
(loonies and all) be allowed
to stand? Most of the
voters of Fulham couldn't
care less. They seemed to
ignore all the fringe
candidates. Those who
FELIX asked said they
thought that fringe
candidates were a waste of
time. One of them
expressed surprise, though,
that he had seen Lord
Sutch campaigning and
looking very concerned
about a shopkeeper's
problems, (incidentally
when FELIX tried to
contact Lord Sutch he was
unavailable for comment as
he was in bed. John
Creighton told FELIX that
he thought it was a total
miscarriage of democracy
that he could run for
Parliament to promote his
company. "If other
companies follow my
example," he said, "I can
see the government
outlawing this". It's difficult
to see how the government
could do this, though,
without banning all
commercial support of
political parties, something
the present Conservative
Government would
obviously be reluctant to
do. The other fringe
candidates obviously feel
they are exercising their
democratic right. Indeed
some like Lady Birdwood
feel they have a duty to 'the
young of the country' to
warn them before it's too
late. The person who
probably really wished that
fringe candidates were
banned was probably the
Head Postmaster/mistress
who had to deal with the
estimated half milllion
pieces of election mail
mailed for free by the
fringe candidates.
