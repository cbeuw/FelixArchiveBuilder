Working Party To Look At Merger With St Mary's
IC May Merge
Imperial College and St Mary's
Medical School are to set up a
joint working party to look at
the possibility of creating a
college of science, technology
and medicine by amalgamating
the institutions. This follows an
approach by the Dean of St
Mary's. The merger, if it
happens, is unlikely to occur
before October 1987.
The proposed merger was
discussed by both Imperial
College's Board of Studies and
St Mary's Academic Board on
Wednesday. Both groups of
academics were in favour of the
merger.
Professor Eric Ash, the
Rector, told FELIX yesterday
that he hoped the merger would
take place. He said that the
'academic case for it is very
strong'. He added that he hoped
that bringing people to Imperial
who had direct human concern
would improve the social life.
Keith Lockyer, secretary of St
Mary's said that academics at St
Mary's were excited by the
possibilities of the merger. They
thought, he said, that it would
create an institution unique in
the United Kingdom.
Union President Carl Burgess
said that personally he didn't
think it would affect students at
IC.
St Mary's is based in
Paddington. It has an
undergraduate intake of about
one hundred a year. It also has

Academic Staff at Imperial are

for Starwars Research. If
accepted, it is estimated that
each contract will be worth
Â£60,000 per year.
Mr Labbett of the Research
contracts office told FELIX that
the response was not as high as
anticipated. He felt that
academics were being detered
by the complicated applications
procedure and by the fact that
there would be 'few rewards'.
Pr Rector Dr Phelps told
FELIX that academics were
already fully committed with
projects. He felt that people had
been detered by uncertainties
over 'classification'.
