Some films are very
enjoyable but then have an
ending that leaves a bad
taste in the mouth so that
the overall feeling is of not
having enjoyed the film too
much, and then there's the
opposite Clue may well be
the opposite.
I came out of this film
based on the board game
Cluedo thinking that it had
been quite fun, but I
suspect that may have been
because of the pacy ending
and the good title music at
the end. In retrospect,
although the film has some
very funny lines, often
pretty silly, somehow the
timing and delivery don't
always live up to the
material written by the
author of YesJMinister.
However the wonderful
Tim Curry who plays the
butler (yes there are a few
additional characters to the
board game) holds the
whole thing together and is
rewarded with some of the
funniest lines. It is his job
to receive the guests, all of
whom have pseudonyms to
preserve anonymity, and to
explain why they have been
invited to an island house
on a stormy night.
The characters provide
the scriptwriter and actors
the chance to create

stereotypes, Colonel
Mustard is a slow,
blustering army officer;
Professor-PI urn is a
lecherous academic; Mr

propriety are all; Miss
Scarlet, a vamp, what else;
Mrs White, blackhearted
widow.
Jonathan Lynn is both
writer and director and
unfortunately his direction
doesn't really do justice to
his material, this may well
be because his experience
is largely in theatre and he
has only previously
directed one short film. The
costumes and sets are
excellent and the actors
give the impression of
having enjoyed making the
film and if you need a
reason to go and see this
film then it's probably
worthwhile for Tim Curry's
hectic summary of the
story—so—far towards the
end of the film.

The plot centred around
Shirley, played beautifully
by Lesley Sharp, and her
1
1 mother Audrey, and dealt
with their mutual problems
of loneliness and an
inability to communicate.
Appropriately, the play
started with Shirley and hei
boyfriend/jailbird Eddie in
bed either in the process
of, or between sessions of
wild passion. This was a
recurring theme with the

Shirley by Andrea Dunbar-Theatre Upstairs. Royal

majority of the characters
obsessed with the
process of procreation, a
notion summed up by
Shirley's T-shirt which had
a picture of two tortoises
eyeing each other up
summarised when he
comments that: 'It's all that
I'm good at'. John and his
slimy glue sniffing mate
Simon, played by Edward
Tudor-Pole (Tenpole Tudor
and Absolute Beginners)
saying 'I would..but I'm too
tired!'.
Eddie is arrested and
despite the fact that he and
Shirley have spent two
years living together, she
quickly finds a replacement
to fill her sexual
(emotional) void in the
form of John, whose
attitude towards sex is

have a double date with
Shirley and her virginal
friend Karen. However later
on it seemed that Simon
might not really be as
interested in the opposite
sex as his friend John,
illustrated when he
commented: 'I'd rather have
a tin of glue than have her'
on the suggestion of a
night with Shirley's Mum;
and when a drunken John
tried it on with an all too
sober Karen, he was met
with lines like: 'I'd rather sit
on gorilla's' and 'I'd rather
go with a pig'. These
encounters were extremely
funny and caused repeated
explosions of laughter from
the audience.
In one scene Audrey is
woken by John and Shirley,
interacting, she listens
jealously to the goings on
and exclaims to her soft-
touch boyfriend, Roy: 'I'm
surprisedthey're not
knackered, that's the fourth
time I've heard them!'" The
ensuing encounter, caused
by the untimely interruption
of daughter by mother was
accompanied by a rich
vocabulary of verbal abuse.
This was followed by the
return of Audrey to her
own bedroom and the
proposal: 'Do you fancy a
bit?'. Susan Brown plays
the frustrated Audrey
perfectly and Shirley
continued in much the
same humourous vein, but
revealed much more about
the characters involved.
Finally, following a bar
room brawl and heated
words, Eddie who has
returned from prison,
discovers that Shirley has

As a result of her success
with Slumber Party
Massacre (great title, huh?)
Amy Jones has been given
greater freedom with her
latest project, Love Letters,
and.hence it is a serious
film which gives Jamie Lee
Curtis her first real grown-
up role.
Anna Winter, Jamie Lee
Curtis, is a programme
director for a radio station
who in the course of her
work becomes involved
with an older, successful
married photographer
against all better
judgement. The major
catalyst in her decision to
pursue this fatal course is
the discovery of letters
written to her mother by an
extra-marital lover. The
intensity of the passion
contained in these letters
leads her to try and find the
passion that has been
missing in her previous
relationships, with the
married photographer,
Oliver Andrews, James
Keach. The film is unusual
because it shows the
relationship from the point
of view of the 'other'
woman and all the trials
this causes, knowing that
her lover sleeps with
another woman every night,
not knowing when he'll be
free to see her. This point
of view necessitates that
the character of the wife is
poorly sketched and it is to
the credit of the acting that
the pain of discovery, that
the wife feels when she
finds out, is very real and
one of the few moments in
the film that actually
conveys the passion that
the film ought to. In spite
of the excellent and very
naturalistic script the
intensity of the relationshi
is never really conveyed
convincingly and as a
result some of the
behaviour resulting from
this passion comes as
surprising.
It is a sad film, the
bitterness that her father
has felt since his discovery
of his wife's activities is
very apparent as is the
shock of Oliver's wife when
she discovers the ;
relationship. Extra—marital
relationships are portrayed
as fated tragic affairs in
which there are no winners,
only losers.

been unfaithful and
immediately packs his bags
to leave, as does Roy who
seeks only the quiet life.
Shirley and Audrey are left
alone and realising that
they have only each other,
they talk for the first time
about how they really feel.
Shirley offers Audrey a
cigarette as a gesture of
friendship and
understanding...
Andrea Dunbar has at
times managed to escape
the all too familiar
problems of more than two
people talking by using
dialogue in parallel. This
device succeeded fairly
well but was perhaps
slightly overused and
occasionally difficult to
follow.
It would be wrong to
think that the involvement
of sex within this play was
either advocating it or
sugggesting total restraint.
The sub-text of Shirley
implies that verbal
communication and
friendship are ultimately far
more important than 'a bit
of flush1
; that the
involvement of two people
should be judged by their
friendship and not by how
far they have got 'in the
sack'. Sex is the icing on
the cake, alone it is too
sweet. S.L.
Delhi Brasserie
134 Cromwell Road (in the
row of shops in front of
Sainsburys).
For the last two years the
Kwality has been the Indian
restaurant that serves IC. In
that time the quality of the
food has declined. The
quality of the service has
declined (possibly because
the waiters have become
fed up with students). The
decor has remained as bad.
The Kwality has become
the sort of place that one
only visits when one has
had a few drinks.
At last there is an
alternative. The Delhi
Brasserie should, if there is
any justice in the world,
become the Indian
restautant for all IC
students who enjoy good
curries. The food is
reasonably priced,
interesting and good, the
decor is attractive and the
service is attentive but not
intrusive.
The starters are fairly
standard. Particularly
recommended are the
samosas (£1.20) which are
crisp, tasty and hot but not
greasy (unlike most
samosas). Also
recommended is the relish
tray which comes with all
the starters. There certainly
seems to be ample mango
chutney unlike every other
Indian restaurant I've been
to.

The range of main
courses is very imaginative.
How many restaurants offer
tandoori quails (£4.50) or
brain massala (£3.50)? The
quails are very tasty and
make a nice change from
the standard chicken
madras that most students
seem to order. For those of
you on a budget or with the
imagination of a cold cup
of tea the restaurant offers
standard madrases and
vindaloos (I wonder if it
should be madri and
vindali) at £2.90. The rice,
bread etc are all up to the
standard one would expect.
If you want something a
little different to the water
you probably usually have
with your curry, I
recommend the Indian
Lager which is one of the
istrongest lagers I've tasted.
I know most of you won't
get as far as the desserts,
but for the record they are
Iworth eating. The kulfi
(£1.50), a type of ice cream,
is very nice as, I am told, is
jthe rasmalai (£1.50). .
The Delhi Brasserie is an
excellent restaurant. It's
.worth going to if you want
a meal after a few beers.
It's worth going to if you
want to take your
girlfriend/boyfriend for a
reasonable meal out. There
are few places in this price
range (approx £10 a head)
where you can say that.
