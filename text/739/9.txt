Two other detectives well
worth mentioning are Gervase
Fen and Father Brown. Father
Brown by G K Chesterton walks
into mysteries like I walk in to
lamposts, and has one of the
best understandings of
characters and uncluttered
logical minds that I've read of. In
The Wisdom of Father Brown-we
meet a mystery brother the
custodian of the family Roman
coin collection, and the
enigmatic blackmailer with a
wax nose who exhorts money
from his sister for the theft of a
coin. There is also a weird sun-
worshiping cult,
whose chief
temple is in an
office block, and
a Cornish family
with a legend
that their wooden
home will
burn to the ground,]
having been
cursed by a
prisoner from the,
Spanish Armada.
Gervase Fen is almost the
complete antithesis of Father
Brown; a Cambridge Don who
loves the limelight, fast cars and
pranks. In Buried for Pleasure
Gervase is an Independant
Parliamentry Canditate (the
result is tied) for Sandford
Angelorum, where amongst the
nutty yokels, non-doing pigs and
bedridden (but totally healthy)
neurotic innkeeper a poisoning
has occured. A bit superficial
but all Chrispin's works are very
charming with plenty of oddball
characters, such as the retired
major of cavalry in Glimpses of
the Moon who dreads riding a
horse because of the statistical
probability that he will fall off. In
this, later, novel a vicious pervert
who tortures animals to death
(suffocating puppies in plastic
bags and snipping up kittens
with scissors) is found
dissmembered and his head
propped up staring at the local
battery-hen owner while she eats
breakfast. It almost ends happily
ever after (not for the murderer)
but not before another body is
found in a tent at a village fete.
This can be found in the
Haldane Library in a nasty
yellow cover.

eyes, created by Raymond
Chandler and being published in
omnibus editions by Picador.
These books are set in the 1930s
and '40s; just post prohibition
days, but read suprisingly
modern. The plots are very
intricate; don't expect to solve
these, their main joy is the vivid
style, keen character
descriptions and witty dialogue.
You can also have sweepstakes
on how many corpses are to be
found/lost/dumped—in The Big
Sleep there's a cyanide
poisoning and four shootings,
and at the beginning of The
Lady in the Lake a pretty grisly
corpse floats to the surface,
followed by more and more
bodies. In The Big Sleep a
seemingly respectable family

suburbs, gamblers have their
winnings nicked by the casino
owners and bodies are found in
all kinds of odd places—for
instance in cars crashed off

stuck into these, whether or not
you've seen the Bogarde movies.

" 'Look here,' cried the young

French detectives certainly are
not over emotional either-a bit
on the morbid side. George

entirely different. Despite
appearing to support the
capitalist myth (her detective is
vice-President of the third
largest American bank) she is a
very good writer, who gathers in
the threads of her story
judiciously. Her books are set in
