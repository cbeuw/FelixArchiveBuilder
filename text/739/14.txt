The main problem with the
summer term is that
everything winds down as
people descend into nervous
breakdowns over their
impending examinations. They
wander round claiming that
they can do nothing but
revise, and then sit at home
watching the zombie box with
a can of lager. For what
reason? Because they've all
been conditioned to think that
exams will eventually be the
cause of the end of the world,
and a nuclear winter has
nothing on an 'F' in Maths. It
wouldn't be so bad if this
phenomenon were confined to
the insular quarters of
Shadow at the Hayward. The
selections at both of these
showcases are depressingly
predictable, with Art and Time
possessing an inordinate
amount of clocks. However,
an old favourite has stepped
in to save the day for the
Barbican in the shape of Print
'86. It features 200 prints by
contemporary British artists in
aid of the Printmakers'
Council. The selection of
styles is incredibly wide-
ranging, taking in satirical
cartoons by the like of Gerald
Scarfe along with the work of
Howard Hodgkin. The
exhibition is in the Concourse
on Level 5.
by the City of London Anti-
Apartheid Group, which has
been going on for ages
anyway. Anybody is welcome
to serenade the Embassy with
Spitting Image's rendition of
'Never Met a Nice South
African'.
More traditional, if less
credible, activities include the
theatre with all its bourgeois
connotations. Play of the
moment appears to be Double
Cross transferring to the
Royal Court Theatre tonight.
It's an odd oeuvre, linking the
lives of two Irish ex-patriots
— one who wormed his way
into becoming Minister of
Information in Churchill's
Imperial College, tucked away
behind Hyde Park.
Unfortunately this insidious
disease of apathy about all
things involving the outside
world has spread to the
corners of London. Because
now, there seems to be bugger
all to do.
This is fine if all you want
to do is enthuse over the next
problem sheet on 'Advanced
Quantum Custard Mechanics',
but if your idea of fun is
something entirely different it
can get really depressing. To
this end, this column attempts
to print all the things perhaps
you might like to do but
hadn't thought of before —
unfortunately this entirely
generous concept has been
scuppered by the fact that
there's precious little to do in
the city this week. However,
undaunted by this, we try to
bring you a potted selection
of ways to avoid revision.
Giving art exhibitions
pretentious titles for thematic
shows appears to be the kiss
of death these days. Two
remarkable examples of this
phenomena are Art and Time
at the Barbican and Falls the
Meanwhile at the Tate, the
prolific David Hockney has
turned his attention to
Cubism, albeit 50 years later
than everyone else. Given his
current mode of progress he
should reach Pre-Raphaelitism
by at least 2018.
Musically speaking,
London's a pretty quiet place
until Tuesday when the
Church, the Waterboys, and
Les Enfants all decide to play
on the same night. Superior
Aussie band, the Church, go
on at one of the best small
venues in the city, namely the
Marquee. In the meantime,
the Waterboys play one of the
best bigger venues in the
shape of the Hammersmith
Palais.
Funnily enough even the
ticket prices are the same, at a
steady fiver on the door. Les
Enfants, on the other hand,
play at the 100 Club in
Oxford Street for the
knockdown price of £3.
Quietness even extends to
the domain of the political
demo this week, with one of
the few events of interest
being the non-stop picket of
South Africa House organised
War Cabinet, and the other
who chose the name Lord
Haw Haw to broadcast
German propaganda to the
British from Berlin.
, Where would Capital Ideas
be without mentioning films
to fill a little space, and this
one is going to be no
different. There's some real
crap out there, featuring
amongst other things a
musical about a snooker game
with a vampire (I kid you
not), and a film based on a
board game — fortunately,
not The Trivial Pursuit Strikes
Back or Revenge of the Killer
Monopolies. But there is
Vagabonde, this week's token
trendy French film to pose
around talking about for the
next month if you've nothing
better to do. It plays at the
Minema and the Renoir
Cinemas — which are also
very good for impressing
those who don't know the
difference between the words
'good' and 'pretentious'.
And with that note I leave
you to your problem Sheets
and the remains of your
lecture notes, because you
won't take any notice.
Nobody ever listens to me.
