THERACEAGAINST TIME
The Race Against time is organised by Sport Aid, for African Famine Relief.
The race is a fun run of 10km (approx. 6 miles) and everyone taking part gets an
Official T-Shirt.
You don't have to take part in a staged race.
If you like, you can organise your own sponsored run, and you'll still be an
official runner.
