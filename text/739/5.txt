Laibach Die Llebe 12 inch
single Cherry Red.
You probably won't have
heard of Laibach, and
almost certainly won't have
heard this single. Laibach
are Yugoslavian, and the
single is good. 'Die Liebe'
(Love) sounds like Art of
7"ne winner of the Laurie Anderson Album was Dave Lock
of Physics 3 who correctly answered that the B side of 'Oh
Superman' was 'Walk the. Dog' and said that he liked
Laurie Anderson because 'she loves her mom. (Hi mom!)'.
Reviews
Noise on speed, heavy on
drums and guitars, yet
possessing the simplicity
and intensity that the title
implies. If you like the
sigle, There is also an
album titled 'Nova Atropola'
on Cherry Red.
Momus C i r c u s Maximus
Cherry Red.
One man's martydrom is
another man's mantinee. Or
so it says at the top of the
press release. Circus
Maximus is nine songs on
biblical themes, but not
once do they degenerate to
the 'Jesus is nice, and 'I'm
so happy' brand of
Christian music. In fact
listening to this record I get
the impression that Momus
(alias Nicholas Currie)
spent his childhood
listening to rather too much
Leonard Cohen and Bob
Dylan. The result is very
listenable album, made up
'variously of songs, strong
lyrically, and of musically
mostly acoustic giutar and
voice, Maybe he'll make a
lot of money. I hope so. I
know nothing of its
religious significance, I
tend to think it may be
tongue-in-cheek, but
Circus Maximus is a record
I'll listen to again and
again.
Various Artists Raging Sun
Rouska
A Compilation of Northern
talent from the Leeds based
FtQuska Label, and why
not? Who can argue with a
track called 'Toxteth
Ablaze'? Who can fault the
Shop Assistants' 'All That
Ever Mattered'. This
compilation, if anything
needed to, would re-affirm
my faith in independent
labels. Alo included in the
tape are The Cassandra
Complex, Third Circle and
The Wedding Present
among others.
This cassette is available
as of May 1st and the
album will be repackaged
and re-promoted before the
end of the year. It is a
rivetting compiliation from
start to finish.
Dodgy Dice
My friend, Cal Kewlass, and
I were recently visiting
Gamble Soc's secret
casino, well hidden in the
maze of tunnels underneath
IC. After giving the secret
pass phrase 'The President
is sober', we were allowed
entry.
Inside, at one of the
tables, there was an
interesting dice game. The
'dealer' had four dice in
front of him. They were'nt
normal dice though, since
they did'nt have each of the
numbers from 1-6 on.
Instead each dice had a
different arrangement of
numbers, with some
numbers repeated on
different faces and no two
dice being alike. This
meant that some of the
dice had a greater than half
probability of throwing
higher than some of others.
In the game the player
would stake as much
money as he liked, the
dealer and the player would
then choose a dice, and
whoever threw higher
would win. What was
interesting was that the
player was allowed to
choose his dice first, so
that he could apparently
choose the 'best' dice and
have a better chance of
winning than the dealer.
After playing for a while
though, I found that I was
consistently losing money.
I tried changing my
strategy and picked dice
randomly, still I lost. I tried
picking the dice that the
dealer had last thrown and
still, even though I
sometimes won, on the
average I lost. Eventually I
ran out of money.
'It's a cheat,' I said to Cal.
'They must be switching
the dice when they see
which one I've chosen. I'm
not coming back here
again!'.
'It's not though,' Said Cal,
who had been watching
closely, 'and I think if you
look at the dice closely,
you'll see what I mean.'
I looked, and found that
he was right-there had
been no cheating.
This week's problem is to
design four dice (using the
numbers 1-6 arranged in
any way on the dice) that
the Casino could have been
using without having to
cheat. Answers, for the £5
prize, plus comments,
criticisms, etc, to the FELIX
office by 1.00pm
Wednesday please.

Angry digits-solution
My sincerest apologies
about this one, by what
seems to be a giant
coincidence there are three
possible solutions. They
are:-
F ^ SEE
BED
mn HE
! £2EEE
E WEB
If you'd known how I
constructed the problem,
though, you'd know that it
was not a coincidence but
that the part of the problem
that I thought was the
cleverest fell flat on it's
face! Clue 8 was badly
phrased, if it had said 'First
digit minus last digit equals
2nd digit minus 3rd' then
the 8329 solution would not
have been allowed and the
solution would be unique.
A few people spotted this,
although I'm obviously
counting any one of the
three as a correct entry.
The winner was Nayan
Raval,Chemistry 3,who
solved it on a computer.As
a general point you're all
welcome to use computers
to solve my problems, but
I'd be grateful if you'd
provide a copy of the
program with your answer-
so Mr Raval, please drop a
copy of your progam into
the FELIX office (perhaps
when you come to collect
your prize, which you can
do after 1.00pm Monday).
This was very popular so I
may try setting a more
devious cross number later
this term.
