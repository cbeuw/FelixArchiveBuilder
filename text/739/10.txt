"You Can't Fool 'em
While Nick Raynsford was
toasting his victory in the
recent Fulham with
Champagne, the other ten
candidates were facing up
to the fact that after two or
three weeks of public
attention they were
nobodies again. For the
Conservative and S D P
candidates things weren't
too bad; they still had the
odd TV appearance ahead
of them where they
attempted to explain their
parties' poor performances.
They had also avoided
losing their £500 deposits.
Eight candidates, though,
had lost their deposits.
It wouldn't have taken a
professional political pundit
to predict that none of
these parties stood a
chance of retaining their
deposit or winning the seat.
Yet all these people were
prepared to spend
significant sums of money
so that they could stand for
Parliament. What made
them do it? Some did it for
the publicity and some did
it because they believed
passionately in a cause.
John Creighton of The
Connoisseur Wine Party
ran for Parliament as a
publicity stunt for the
company he works for,
Connoisseur Wines of
Fulham. He worked out that
for your £500 deposit you
get '67,000 first class
stamps' so that you can
mail every voter in Fulham.
The company had just
opened a warehouse selling
wines in bulk to the public
so entering a candidate in
the election seemed an
easy way of contacting all
the local residents to tell
them of this new service.
Companies are not
allowed to advertise on
election publicity so Mr
Creighton couldn't mention
the warehouse directly. He
did, though, use the
company logo with the's'
of wines deleted as the
party logo. He invited
constituents to contact him
between 11am and 6pm
(the opening times of
Connoisseur Wines) at an
address that turned out to
be the warehouse of
Connoisseur Wines.
Nobody but an idiot could
fail to realise that his
In Fulha
The FELIX Guide To Fringe
Parliamentary Candidates
election leaflets were an
advert for a wine company.
Mr Creighton's
campaign was apparently
successful (although he
only polled 127 votes). Not
only did he leaflet every
voter in Fulham (the cost of
which was £1500 including
the deposit) but he also got
a lot of publicity in the
trade press, something
that's important as
Connoisseur Wines deal
primarily with the wine
trade rather than the
public. He also received
three job offers because
other wine companies were
so impressed with his
marketing strategy.
Incidentally if you want a
case of wine, Connoisseur
Wine are based at 27
Carnwath Road.
The candidature of
people like Mr Creighton
does make one wonder if
the electoral system should
be changed. For £500 and a
small number of
nominators anyone can
stand spreading any sort of
loony philosophy. The
Dowager Lady Jane
Birdwood of England
Demands Repatriation was
easily the most obnoxious
II
Lisa Duke
and most loony. Dressed in
a v-necked jersey with an
England logo on the breast
she looks like everyone's
ideal grandmother.
Unfortunately in
publications with slogans
like 'Racialism Is Patriotism'
she demands forced
repatriation for everyone
she doesn't regard as
English, whether they have
been born in England or
not. She doesn't say if this
will mean that Prince
Phillip (a Greek) will be
sent back. Lady Birdwood
has to work harder tham
most of the other
candidates involved in the
by-election because the
Post Office refuse to
handle her racist
publications.
The most worrying thing
about Lady Birdwood's
campaign was the fact that
she came fourth with 226
votes.
In addition to the
candidates promoting
racism and the candidates
promoting private
companies, the other class
of candidate who appear to
waste the electorate's time
and patience are the 'joke'
candidates. At Fulham Liza
Duke ran for the Captain
Rainbow Universal Abolish
Parliament Party and Lord
Sutch ran for (surprise,
surprise) the official
Monster Raving Looney
Party. Ms Duke and Mr
Lord David Sutch formed a
last-minute alliance. As a
result the glamourous Ms
Duke complete with skin
tight green trousers
(designed to grab the votes
her policies couldn't) was
seen pounding the streets
of Fulham telling people to
vote for Lord Sutch. Her
campaign slogan 'You
Can't Fool 'Em in Fulham'
was proved true when she
polled an amazing 37 votes
and Lord Sutch managed
an amazing 134 votes.
Ms Duke invested an
amazing amount of money
in her campaign. Campaign
workers were situated
throughout Fulham
handing out glossy full
colour leaflets advocating
such loony policies as
replacing Parliament with
home computers on which
everyone would vote on
