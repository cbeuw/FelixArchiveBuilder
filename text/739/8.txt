The world of the Detective can vary from the terrorists' London of
the 80's to gentle south-east villages in the '20s. The one thing they
tend to have in common is a dead body and one person who can
find the murderer before mere mortals have recoverd from the
shock. Novels about 'tecs, dicks, eyes or G-wo/men range from the
wacky and ridiculous to the cognitative and intellectual, with every
spectrum of humour and tragedy between. Detectives can be
Chicago hard men, poetry writing Police Inspectors, old ladies,
Catholic priests, Dons, nurses and travelling port and spirits
salesmen.
While not being a totally
Anglo-Saxon tradition, most
stories are English or American;
many of the non-American
foreign investigators being
created by English or American
writers, a pleasant exception
being George Simenon's
'Inspector Maigret'. English
detectives are noticably more
snobbish then American ones;
Dorothy L Sayers bases most of
her books around a Duke's
brother, Sherlock Holmes
compared the common police
force to 'a herd of buffalos', and
one of the ultimates in fiction is
Gervase Fen, a Cambridge don.
The dissimilarity between
British and American gun laws
results in most trans-Atlantic
murders being by the bullet,
while the ones back home
involve air guns, plastic bags
poison tipped blowpipe darts
filled hypodermic syringes and
saucepans full of cyanide-
impregnated wax. Murder is
what everybody wants, of
course, and the more of them,
and the juicier they are, the
better. Cheating at cards or the
odd jewel robbery might fill a
gap, but as a nation we like
nothing more than to mentally
wade into the gore, and
Americans even more so.
The books themselves vary
enormously in style, content and
quality. There are the old
favourites - the Sherlock Holmes
stories, by Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle, which can be found in
just about any bookshop. Most
are imaginative short stories,
with Holmes sniffing out clues
like a truffle-hound, but always
urbane, and usually witty, with
the faithful Watson at his side as
the perfect stooge. The ideas for
the plots are ingenious: precious
sapphires hidden in a goose
crop in the Blue Carbuncle
heiresses being murdered by
snakes descending fake
bellropes (The Speckled Band)
In another story trunks of
precious stones and pearls,
stolen from an Indian Prince
were fought over by convicts
and cannibals and dumped in
the mud of the Thames, not to
mention a one legged sailor, a
tugboat chase scene with an
Indian firing poisoned blowpipe
darts at his pursuers, (who had
tracked him down by covering
his wheels of his carriage in
aniseed). And all in the same
tale, I kid you not.
Another couple of old faithfuls
are The Moonstone and The
Woman in White by Wilkie
Collins, which both take the
form of series of narratives; by
servants, onlookers, even by the
criminals themselves, opening
up not only the story but the
wonderfully diverse characters
as well. The Moonstone centres
around the theft of a famous
(and cursed) diamond, which is
followed by three Indian
Brahmins who seek to return it
to the forehead of a sacred
statue. The stone passes
through a pawnbrokers before
the body of the thief is found in
discuise. The Woman in White is
more complex; a question of
identity. A young wife is locked
in her room by her bounty
hunting husband, an eccentric
Italian villain, a sane person
imprisoned in a mad-house and
then rescued â€” but by then
insane herself; all the elements
make it seem like a macarbre
nightmare, and even though it is
126 years old the book was not
one that I could put down.
More up to date but nowhere
near as good are the
Professionals books by Ken
Blake; basically extended and
boring accounts of the TV
series. The hunky heros dazzled
me with their cliched wit-
staccato sentences proving that
when only seconds away from
death they can still play to the
gallery. This tough-guy stuff
may push the ratings up but in a
book it falls very flat and there is
no plot, no character
development, nothing.
It is noticable, however, how
good women murder writers are-
all that frustration has to go
somewhere. Josephine Tey is
one of the most brilliant crime
writers I know of; she gives clear
personal portraits, a plot that
flows nimbly and credible
crimes. Brat Farrar is a rather
incestuous mystery about a
family literally brother against
brother in pursuit of an
inheritiance, with unexpected
hidden secrets and hatreds
which was on the goggle-box
last year. Other good stories
include The Franchise Affair and
The Daughter of Time, both of
these published by Penguin. The
setting for The Daughter of Time
is very limiting; a hospital bed,
but Ms Tey ingeniously uses all
the material she can, libraries,
history books, amazing
characters and sheer
imagination to develop a superb
who dunit. Or rather
whodunn'em, the 'em' being the
Princess in the Tower. 'Passe' I
hear you yell, but when this was
written everyone automatically
condemned Richard III - who
didn't have a hunch back, by the
way. The arguments in this book
are still fresh lively and human,
and the fifteenth century comes
so close you can almost smell it.
Richard is completely
exonerated and the real villain
O i -
shown to be the usurping Henry
VII. The Franchise Affair
concerns two women accused of
kidnapping and beating a fifteen
year old girl, and again Ms Tey
turns a story with what appears
to be little material into a
gripping and spellbinding book.
P D James and Dorothy L
Sayers are two other women
crime writers that I'd class as
very distinguished. In The Black
Tower by P D James,
Commander Adam Dagliesh,
iMetropolitan Police officer and
poet, goes to see an old friend,
Father Baddeley, chaplain at a
Dorset home for sufferers of
debilitating diseases (such as
multiple schlerosis). Adam
arrives to find his friend dead
eleven days previously; not long
before, one of the patients had
fallen off a cliff top in a
wheelchair, and four more
deaths are to follow: a
smothering, a faked suicide, a
shooting and a real suicide, not
to mention attempted murder by
arson. Wot larks - the story is
crisp, even though the fecundity
of corpses is a bit unbelievable,
and her other books are just as
good: Unnatural Causes, Cover
Her Face, Shroud for a
Nightingale (where a nurse dies
after being fed neat
disinfectant), An Unsuitable Job
for a Woman (introducing
Cordelia Gray, woman
detective), Death of an Expert
Witness and Innocent Blood.
An Unsuitable,
Job For A.
Woman!
In the Teeth of the Evidence is
a collection of short stories by
Dorothy L Sayers, which are
prodigiously varied and
interesting. For example, one
story concerns a dentist whose
faked suicide was detected by
his using the wrong type of
filling paste in the corpse's teeth,
another is a puzzle verging on
the psychological, as to whether
a writer murdered an actor by
switching blood transfusion
samples. In this volume Mr
Montague Egg, travelling
salesman for Messrs Plummet
and Rose, sellers of fine ports
and wines, is introduced. He
discovers a professor who is not
a weird and batty Prof, as he
may seem, but a missing
financier with badly fitting false
teeth. In many of her other
books Lord Wimsey features
prominantly, the foppish brother
of the richest Duke in England
and a cross between Holmes
and Bertie Wooster. He even has
a faithful butler.
