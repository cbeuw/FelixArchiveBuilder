Imperial plumps for a new election
Over 1,000 Imperial College stu-
dents voted in this week's Sabbatical
Elections to reopen nominations for
the post of ICU President, the highest
vote for New Election ever recorded.
Sam Baker, the only candidate for
the post, lodged an official complaint
detailing her grievances with certain
aspects of the elections.
In the most hotly contested race,
that for Deputy President (Finance &
Services), Rob Clark overcame a sig-
nificant deficit on the South
Kensington campus to win with
almost 300 St Mary's votes. The
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) was similarly decided
when Smita Chaturvedi won despite
a deficit of over 100 votes south of
Hyde Park. Jeremy Thomson was
elected as Felix Editor (and Print
Unit Manager) with the help of St
Mary's votes, despite suffering at the
hands of the well organised New
Election campaign.
The two candidates for DP(C&S)
proved to be the most conciliatory of
all, with Sarah Thomas insisting that
her opposing candidate would prove
successful. Smita was almost speech-
less after her victory, saying "I'm
very happy" and that she was "going
straight to bed now, I'm very tired."
Chris Ince, SCC Chair and senior
member of the Elections Committee,
spoke to Felix about the appeal from
Sam Baker saying that it was "under
consideration." He went on to say
that "the points that it made will
probably come up in Council next
Tuesday" and that it would "Sam
made it quite clear that she had no
objection to how the results went this
year."
The New Election campaign itself
has come under scrutiny with allega-
tions that its budget was never
approved by ICU Council, the prac-
tice of previous elections (Felix
1018). There has been no official
statement as to how much money the
New Election campaign has spent.
Sarah Thomas, who is also ICU
Council Chair, denies that the expen-
diture of Union money was approved
by Council.
Nomination papers for the position
of President will be posted at the
beginning of next term.

Bomb Squad defuses Queen's Lawn hoax
MARIA IOANNOU
A bomb scare disrupted Wednesday
lunchtime when a parcel, believed to
have been an explosive device, was
placed on the front desk of the
Sherfield Security reception. The
incident, described later as a "silly
student prank", necessitated the
mobilisation of the Bomb Squad.
The drama began when at 1.25pm
when a student, claiming that a man
in Queens Gate had given him £10
to deliver the parcel to Security,
deposited the item together with a
"special message of apology". The
circumstances were enough to raise
the suspicions of the security guards
as this ploy is known to be typical
terrorist tactic. There were fears that
a former Northern Ireland Minister,
visiting College at the time, might be
in danger.
The parcel was "extremely heavy
for an item of that size" said Ken
Weir, Deputy Head of Security,
which further heightened his anxiety.
Mr Weir went on to say that "It was
a plastic bag with a vinyl case inside
and a handle sticking out of the top, I
wasn't about to open it."

Security in action! Local Police, Imperial College Security Officers and
the Bomb Squad acting in concert to defuse a bomb hoax.
Acting quickly and efficiently,
Terry Sweeney, who just last week
revived an inebriated student when
he stopped breathing, picked up the
package and moved it to the doorstep
of the Sherfield exit facing the
Queens Lawn. With remarkable
presence of mind Ken Weir, worried
that the package might explode,
moved it to the centre of Queens
Lawn. Fortunately there were several
police officers on campus barcoding
bicycles and after a quick discussion,
PC Clive Coleman called the Bomb
Squad.
When the team of experts arrived
they cordoned off the Queens Lawn
area and evacuated students from the
vicinity. The windowed areas of the
buildings adjacent to the lawn had
already been cleared at the orders
Keith Reynolds, Head Security, with
the help of Ken Weir and the
Emergency Response Team. The
Bomb Squad then proceeded to
examine the parcel and needed two
X-rays to fully ascertain the object's
nature.
Coming to the conclusion that the
parcel was in fact an inoffensive arti-
cle the team decided to open it.
Inside they found an over head pro-
jector that had been stolen last Friday
during ICU International Night from
the office of Ian Gillet, IC Safety
Officer.
Security notified students of the all
clear and staff were allowed to re-
enter their buildings at 2.14 pm after
nearly an hour. A fatigued Mr Weir
expressed his disdain saying "It
seems to have been a silly student
prank ... which has caused a major
incident and wasted large amounts of
police time and money." The local
constabulary have asked IC Security
to aid them in their search for those
behind the incident. Criminal charges
for wasting police time are being
considered.
