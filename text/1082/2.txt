Elections Analysis
P H O T O S : L I L I T C H E A N G
Next year's sabbaticals: from left to right Rob Clark (Deputy President
for Finance & Services); Jeremy Thomson (Felix Editor); Smita
Chaturvedi (Deputy President Clubs & Societies). The post of President
was won by New Election (aka Re-Open Nominations).
EDWARD SHIRMAN
The most outstanding feature of this
year's sabbatical elections was the
40% increase in turnout over the
1996 results. Almost four hundred
extra South Kensington students
voted, marginalising the St Mary's
vote, which stayed static at just under
three hundred, from one third to one
quarter of the total votes cast.
While their influence on the
results decreased significantly, the
medics ballot papers were instru-
mental in getting both of the success-
ful Deputy Presidential candidates
elected, despite their unpopularity in
South Kensington. Mr Clark's case is
the most dramatic since he received
the lowest vote of all four candidates
south of Hyde Park, not even manag-
ing 20% of the poll. He would have
been the first to be eliminated were it
not for the 287 votes that he received
from the Mary's students.
With this block vote, Rob Clark
was able to lead from the first round
through all three votes, despite
receiving slightly less second and
third preference votes than Duncan
Tindall. While Mr Clark received a
total of 92 transfers from John
Savery and New Election, Mr
Tindall's 101 transfers were not
enough to trouble the Mary's vote.
The latter achieved the highest per-
centage vote of any of the candidates
from a single ballot box, when
almost 80% of the Civil Engineering
voters came out in his favour.
The medical influence on the
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) election was even more
marked as the winning candidate
received the lowest South Ken. vote
of all three candidates, but was saved
by 285 votes from the northerners.
Smita Chaturvedi eventually
squeezed home despite losing out 2:1
on the New Election transfers to
Sarah Thomas.
While the election of Felix Editor
was considerably more consensual,
Jeremy Thomson would not have
been successful if St Mary's had
voted against him. The sole candi-
date received over 60% of the South
Kensington votes but the 279 med-
ical votes could have scuppered his
hopes.
The Presidential race was the only
clear cut decision, with a phenome-
nal 802 votes being cast in South
Kensington for New Election. With
Sam Baker receiving a derisory 124
first preferences, even the medics
could not have saved her from
defeat.
Considering the results on a box
by box basis, the most notable
change was the extra 100 students
who voted in Huxley. This group
increased from their previous 120
votes to become the largest South
Kensington group with over 220
expressing their views. Elsewhere an
extra 60 voted in Electrical
Engineering, an extra 40 in the Royal
School of Mines and another 40
extra in Civil Engineering. With 11
ballot boxes this year, one more than
last year, the shared polling station
between Blackett and Chemical
Engineering netted 70 more votes.
Notably if the elections had been
carried out in a manner similar to the
US Senate Elections some rather dif-
ferent results would have been pro-
duced. Leaving aside Silwood and
the NHLI, Sarah Thomas topped the
poles in six departments, New
Election in three and Smita
Chaturvedi in just two. Duncan
Tindall did even better, coming first
in six areas, New Election did so in
two with John Savery and Rob Clark
gaining one each. Jeremy Thomson
was only beaten in one of the ballot-
ing areas, with the JCR coming out
in favour of New Election. The
Presidential race was as clear cut as
ever under this system, with Sam
Baker failing to top the poll in any
department.
