Interested in a career at the nerve centre of
global investment banking? Then come and
meet the NatWest Markets' team. We'll be able
to tell you about career opportunities available
and how you can make a high-profile impact in
either Operations or IT.
You should expect to gain a first or second-
class degree in an IT-related, engineering,
economics, business or management science
discipline. If you've already applied to us, the
presentation can be seen as the initial stage of
the selection process; if you haven't, it's not too
late but please bring your CV with you. If you
are attending, please give your name to your
Careers Service. Refreshments will be provided.
