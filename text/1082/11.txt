Since this article is well behind
schedule, I am able to pass comment
on the Election results. Not Wirral
South (allow a man his private grief)
but our own little shindig. All in all,
you, for the most part, voted sensi-
bly. Congratulations to Smita, Rob
And Jeremy, whom I know will do a
sterling job next year. As for the
Presidency, the result was hugely
relieving. I have now seen four cam-
paigns, and this has been without
doubt the most pathetic. The two
candidates (I suppose that should be
three, including New Election, who
behaved impeccably throughout) left
us in doubt that they were running for
no other reason than to shore up
decidedly soggy CVs.
Suggestions to turn ICU into a
brothel, for example, are fine as
slightly jokey asides, but in the
absence of any real ideas and propos-
als, one is left feeling that this is a
major plank of the manifesto. In the
light of this and other examples of
outright stupidity, mitigated only by
one of the candidates having the
good sense to throw in the towel, it is
hardly surprising that New Election
won by a landslide. IC does not have
the most sophisticated electorate in
the world (witness the pathetic herd
instinct at Mary's), but to suggest
that Felix unfairly coaxed students
into voting this way — . T > 1
is laughable. As one M m o n baker
of the great philoso-
phers once said, we may
be daft, but we're not
stupid.

for your devastating honesty, Mike,
saying that you are not particularly

science is com-
pletely clear on

front, someone
in your depart-
ment is con-
cealing a lot
from you.
The piece on
ccommodation
is very interest-
ing. Since there
were few rich pick-
ings in the SCR this
week, I followed the
responding to this
sort of rubbish, particularly given
that the moron that wrote it remained
anonymous, so I shan't. I loved the
interview with Mike Hansen, which
colleague Don on
IC Dystorter and climbed up Queen's
Tower to spy the rubbish rustling
around down below, looking for
anything useful. I was in luck. Simon
Wistow stated that halls of residence
suffered from a crippling lack of
funds. This is not strictly true. The
money is there, but Estate's seem
loathe to spend it. Among the crisp
packets blowing in the wind, I saw
something that said Estates under-
spent on residence annual mainte-
nance contracts by 53% in the year to
31st July 1996. Mr Wistow and his
investigators will be delighted to
hear that this is not afflicting all
walks of College life; £164,500 was
spent when Suite Five was beauti-
fied. As of the 31st September 1996,
there was £1.2 million in the resi-
dences long term maintenance capi-
tal account. Also, as I heard in the
foyer of Sherfield, 23% of the resi-
dences budget goes on cleaning,
almost as much as the 31 % spent on
premises themselves. Given the huge
number of cleaners I remember from
my days in Linstead, this does not
surprise me. Bearing in mind that
14% of the total budget goes on their!
wages alone, this is an issue which
must be tackled. A shortage of cash
is not the problem. A willingness to
spend it and spend it wisely is the
problem in this case. Plus ga
change...
Afua Osei asks why national voters aban-
don those who stole their policies for the
ambiguities of the main parties
The "New Election" result for IC
president was a joy to behold; one
could only dream about this kind of
result happening in the national
arena. Imagine it, the entire British
electorate voting "New Election"-
wishful thinking as this option is
unavailable on national ballot papers.
However the British public could
still choose rebellion from the appar-
ently amorphous, indistinguishable
Labour and Conservative parties in
favour of a party who at least have
the honesty to give us a defined set of
absolute promises of their plans for
power.
This result would dynamically
shatter the whole foundations of the
Labour party, as well as totally oblit-
erating the careers of Blair, Brown
and Harman. Labour would have
nowhere to turn, it would have sailed
the tides of socialism, liberalism, and
now left wing conservatism. Labour
would be relegated to the political
archives.
Meanwhile the bullying
Conservative party whips, courtesy
of Gorman, Howard and Portillo
would grab that party by the horns
(with the inevitable ousting of John
Major) and veer towards the extreme
right. They would embrace absolute
extreme free market economics and
nationalism. They would even have
the disastrous, transient flirtation
with fascism; alienating the prosper-
ous ethnic business communities
who Major has taken pains to woo.
They would lose a significant per-
centage of their loyal business com-
munity, who accept total British co-
operation in European integration as
a painful necessity, if London is to
become the financial centre of
Europe.
Amongst others, the Liberal
Democrats are at present attempting
to force themselves into this mould,
with their pledge of a lp increase in
income tax simultaneously destroy-
ing their electoral chances and mark-
ing them out as the one major party
to offer a realistic, believable mani-
festo. At the same time, the Scots and
Welsh Nationalists, and even Jimmy
Goldsmith's bunch of weirdos, are
able to pick-up a multitude of voters,
as their supporters can at least rest
assured that they know what policies
their vote is mandating. And
although many people would claim
that a vote which did not go to a
Labour or Conservative candidate
constitutes a pointless, worthless
protest, surely last Tuesday night has
taught us all that if the disenchanted
and the downhearted band together,
then the sum total of their feelings
can (and will) be heard.
London Bridge to Waterloo
(East)
Across the river, monsters,
Giant Godzillas groping.
For pride of place in the pile
That lives upon an ocean
Of floating finance food
For business suited sharks.
Money grows on trees
In these 1990's parks.
The past is on my side,
Coronation Street chimneys rising,
Brown bricked buildings falling down
Like London Bridge, but hiding
In the ancient alleyways,
Grimey shirted gravelmen,
Returning home to terraced tears
That people wept in 1910.
Separate sides of London live,
Across the deep and dirty Thames.
The rich and poor, the old and new,
Are both on view from travelling trains.
And as I watch this timewarp tell
A tale of different destinies,
My mind is split apart in two
By river, time and empathy.
