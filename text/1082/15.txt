It's the pits for the lady miners
We played Charring Cross earlier
this term. We didn't like them then.
We really don't like them now.
Their act of generosity in donating
a player to strengthen our side to an
impressive count of nine partici-
pants, was soon forgotten as the
umpiring became blatantly biased.
The umpire was instructed by one of
their players and some extremely
weird rules were introduced. It was
only fifteen minutes into the match
when Sarah intervened, and left the
pitch to the umpire.
In the second half, our guest
Charring Cross player took over the
umpiring and Sarah returned. Thanks
go to Maria (our supporter) for help-
ing us out by playing hockey for the
very first time in the second half.
The extra space on the pitch elim-
inated confusion and co-ordination
developed in our game, chiefly
between Alex, Roz and Selina.
Estella and Maria cleared the ball
quickly and effectively following
more cunning saves from Emma.
Sarah worked easily up the pitch,
facing only inaccurate and pathetic
opposition. This resulted in several
beautiful shots across goal by Roz
which had great potential for scoring.
Unfortunately the goals didn't quite
happen - there were just too many of
them.
It's tough to win with a full team
and one referee opposing.

Chess checks in
Imperial College played Crowthorne
in the national handicapped rapid
play championships. With an
Average ELO of 2250 we were heav-
ily outgraded, and therefore needed
only 2.5 / 8 to win. Imperial College
scored exactly 2.5 / 8 and so go
through to the next stage. The results
were:
Matt Piper 1.5 12 vs. ELO 2370
Dom Goodwin 1/2 vs. ELO 2270
Dave Tang 012 vs. ELO 2225
Lloyd Kilford 012 vs. ELO 2145

Runners rule the roost
A generally good performance from
IC cross-country, enhanced by the
hot pants worn by the King's College
women, was marred by the retire-
ment of Gaffer at the start of the sec-
ond lap. His pink dress was too
uncomfortable.

Sports Eds] and Flasher, enjoyed a
pre-race drink at the bar before turn-
ing in their best performances of the
year. The Rolling Stone put in the
greatest sprint finish, event though
there was no-one around him!
Gaffer surrendered his pink dress
to Slapper and Dumpster who fought
over the rights to it after they failed
to turn up to the bar afterwards.
The women sealed victory in the
league even though Jennie jogged it,
and Dawn missed the finish.

IC football in not crap shock
Yet again the conditions were against
IC, playing away to league leaders
LSE in the usual windy conditions.
The weather made it difficult to slip
into the slick passing style that we
have so successfully copied from the
second team.
The first half was tending to a
draw until five minutes from half
time our smooth-talking and inspira-
tional captain Donal passed to
"Pretty boy" Alex who successfully
took on the keeper, dancing around
the stranded goalie and making the
score one-nil to IC, a due reward for
our domination, sturdy play and
sheer good looks.
The second half commenced in a
fiery fashion with Chris "Psycho"
Solberg regaining form and sending
an LSE player to hospital with torn
ligaments - although when the ambu-
lance turned up Chris ran off as they
thought the men in white coats had
come for him.
Following this incident a pass
from our Nordic Nightmare
Germund resulted in a second goal
for Spanish Superstar Alex. LSE
heads dropped and our professional-
ism set in as we defended like Italy.
This was one of our better perfor-
mances with particular mention to
the mighty Robo (for midfield
strength), Jamie (who learned from
his mistakes) and Alex (who had
pretty hair). A good performance and
with a few more like this the league
should be ours. We have now beaten
every team in our league and have
won 5-2 and 6-2 when fielding our
three first-choice strikers Alex, Amo
and Ike. Our title challenge is in the
balance with the league leaders need-
ing to drop points if we are to tri-
umph and bring the league title to
where it belongs.
