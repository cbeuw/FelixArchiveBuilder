Record International Night draws acclaim
A L O K J H A
A record sixteen societies came
together under the banner of the
Overseas Societies Committee last
week for International Night 1997.
The event consisted of, as usual, a
food fair followed by a cultural show
and a disco.
International Night has long been
the most popular social event in the
college calendar with people from all
over the country, as well as London,
attending the festivities. This year
provided no exception with events
that lasted a total of over seven hours
enjoyed by all that attended.
The evening started with punters
sampling food from all the participat-
ing societies in the dining hall. This
lasted longer than expected and the
cultural show in the Great Hall was
delayed by some three quarters of an
hour in the end. The show was well
worth the wait, however.
Each society performed a short
and highly entertaining piece to
demonstrate their culture both tradi-
tional and modern. Of particular note
were the Malaysian society who did

a traditional song known as 'Dikir
Barat' which involved a twenty-five
strong chorus performing synchro-
nised hand and body movements
whilst singing. The Bangladeshis
treated the audience to a day in the
life of a 'rickshawalla' whose various
passengers provided an insight into
his culture. No International Night
would have been complete without
the Lebanese belly dancer and there
was another this year in full force
providing much entertainment for the
male populace present.
The audience seemingly enjoyed
the entire show and their support was
always evident not only in their
appreciation for each act but their
willingness to join in with an
impromptu 'Macarena' lesson given
by the Tamil Society. The two com-
peres, Gaurav Misra and Zahira
Zainudin, handled the proceedings
very capably and provided an amus-
ing touch to the evening with their
mock bickering at the end of each
item.
The show went on well past mid-
night, demonstrating that there had
been a great amount of work put into
it. The finale unleashed thousands of
pieces of silver paper onto the audi-
ence as well as many balloons,
accompanied by the arrival onto
stage of the national flags of all the
participating countries.
The party then carried on in the
SCR well into the small hours of
Saturday morning. Commenting on
the whole event, one member of the
audience simply said, 'This is the
best International Night I've ever
been to.'
