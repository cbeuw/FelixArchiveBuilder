Birkbeck closes physics
J E R E M Y C L A R K E
The closure of the Physics depart-
ment at Birkbeck College is immi-
nent according to Michael de
Podesta, one of the lecturers in
physics. Birkbeck College, a college-
of the University of London, is pri-
marily a night-school who's long-
term future is uncertain due to its
lack of funding.
The total spending of Birkbeck is
approximately £33 m of which
around £20m is spent on the academ-
ic departments and the rest on over-
heads including the administration,
registry and various publications.
Projections of the College's budget
indicate that without the Physics
department, Birkbeck will break
even next academic year, but will be
in debt from then onwards with an
estimated debt of £2m by the year
2000. One member of staff stated the
feeling in the physics department
was one of "despondency".
The shortfall in funding is mainly
caused by an increase in expenditure
from academic salaries without a
corresponding increase in funding.
At present the department costs an
estimated £lm to run each year, but
only £500,000 is available to fund it.
Further cuts are to be made by amal-
gamating several departments. Of the
8 academic staff in the department,
U C L proposes to take on four, the
remainder are to be laid off. The four
staff are likely to move into the new
Condensed Matter group at UCL.
The academic board has recently
recommended the closure of the
physics department as long as there
are "sufficient safeguards for student
interests". However, it is the respon-
sibility of the governors to finally
decide whether the department is to
go, but this is expected to be a for-
mality.
Despite the problems involved, the
outlook for the students is less seri-
ous. University College, which
already works closely with Birkbeck
has agreed to take over the present
undergraduates, offering a two-
streamed approach to the physics
courses, with new Birkbeck students
essentially following the U C L
physics courses. Current second and
third years will be able to continue
their present courses, but the first
will be required to change their
approach. It is not clear where, in
future, the lectures will take place,
and the viability of science at
Birkbeck is in serious doubt.
Birkbeck College offers a unique
place in the University of London
and doubt about its future means
there will be a further gap in Higher
Education provision. As funding for
courses and living costs becoming
ever more difficult for students to
meet, Birkbeck enables people with
commitment to obtain a degree
whilst earning their living during the
day. That Birkbeck has no firm
assurance of a future implies that
even fewer students will be able to
obtain a degree and the shortage of
suitably-trained graduates in the
workplace will become even more
acute.
Exam policy
aired
N E W S T E A M
It has been confirmed this week that
students will be represented on
College committees which consider
examination policies. Past com-
plaints over the introduction of a
College wide calculator policy has
led to acceptance that student reps
must have input on these matters.
Mr Vernon McClure, Academic
Registrar, explained to Felix that in
accordance with the continuing del-
egation of powers from the
University of London to IC, the two
old Examinations Committees are
being disbanded. They last met in
November and with their imminent
departure they will never have had
student involvement.
Mr McClure insisted that "they
are University of London commit-
tees and there is no provision in the
approved constitution of each for
student membership." The examin-
ing committees' work is due to be
taken over by the existing
Engineering Studies Committee and
Science Studies Committee, both of
whom will continue to have a signif-
icant student presence.
Final confirmation of the exami-
nation committee changes will be
taken at the Board of Studies meet-
ing on the 18 June.
Southside barred
KELLY ROBINSON
Regular patrons of Southside Bar
who were dismayed to find their
usual haunt closed last weekend will
be relieved to learn that the bar
should be back on stream by Friday.
The bar was forced to close last
weekend, during what is usually their
busiest period, whilst contractors
carried out emergency work to meet
Licensing Authority standards. An
Authority safety officer, who visited
the premises on 27th February, ruled
recent building works illegal and
demanded the bar close immediately.
His decision came after refurbish-
ments to Southside basement in
preparation for the new health centre
caused an alteration to the bar's
emergency exit. This route would
have meant students crossing the
training room, a plan which the
inspector felt involved unnecessary
risk.
Whilst the changed route had
recently been approved by the
District Surveyor, the licensing offi-
cial disagreed and also stipulated that
a door leading to a set of stairs,
which formed an integral part of the
escape route, was too narrow.
Ian Frame, Imperial College's
Projects Manager, spoke to the con-
tractors working on the new medical
centre and an alternative route was
devised. According to Mr Frame all
involved, including Ian Caldwell, are
"a lot happier with the new route."
He further commented that "It will
simply involve people walking
straight up the stairs and out of the
building, allowing no confusion."
To make way for this diversion an
existing wall had to be knocked
through. If this wall had been a parti-
tion, the building work would have
been finished in time for Friday night
opening. However, the wall proved
to be constructed from solid concrete
and so the premises remained closed
until Sunday evening.
Mr Roger Pownall, Southside Bars
Manager was unavailable for com-
ment as Felix went to press.
News in Brief
IMPERIAL TOTTY?
According to Cosmopolitan maga-
zine "Imperial College is Britain's
ideal courting campus" with 71.4%
males. The article includes a map
showing places that provide supreme
meeting/matching/mating opportuni-
ties. What they don't take into
account is the quality of the male
specimen. One female IC student
commented, "We have quantity, but
quality - well, that's debatable. The
Cosmo article was obviously penned
by someone who hasn't been to the
campus to see the sorry state of
affairs."
R C S U ELECTIONS
Amongst a set of immaterial votes
for uncontested RCSU Executive
Committee posts, the contest for
Royal College of Science President
stood out as the only ballot with a
majority of less than 140. The effect
of single-transferable voting was
demonstrated to the full when Karl
Stand turned an eight vote deficit to
Charlie Joynt into a five vote majori-
ty in the second round. First round
totals of 132 for Joynt and 124 for
Stand became 135 and 140 votes
respectively on the second count.,
when the 39 counts for New Election
were redistributed. This pushed Mr
Stand two votes past the 138 quota
necessary for victory. Returning
Officer Duncan Robertson described
the turnaround as "One of the most
surprising results I've ever seen".
Elsewhere, first years Poppy
Buxton and Mo Mansoori took land-
slide victories as Academic Affairs
Officer and Honorary Secretary
respectively. Nick Swain took 214
out of 295 votes cast to be re-elected
as Honorary Junior Treasurer for
97/98, and Rob Park and Eric
Wratten combined to take the post of
RCS Vice-President by an over-
whelming majority of 186. However,
with all these posts uncontested and
none of the candidates expressing
extremist opinions, the victors were
never in doubt.
