Mary's sucked dry by vampires
The scene is set - one of the oldest
rugby competition in the world and
St. Mary's are in the final, as they
have been for the last twenty years
(having won the thirteen of them).
The crowd was hyped and in good
voice for the match of the season for
St. Mary's, and their opponents
Guy's and St. Thomas's. Mary's did-
n't seem too worried by the vampiric
habits of the Guy's players especial-
ly after the first match of the day, in
which the Mary's Thirds had beat the
Guy's Thirds in a closely fought 17-
14. The match kicked off and Guy's
took an early lead with some consec-
utive penalty kicks, but fly-half
Clifford pulled back with a penalty
kick. The Guy's fly-half took an
amazing penalty kick from the
halfway line with only a slight fol-
lowing wind to put them ahead by a
margin of six again.
Half an hour into the match and
Jim Piatt scored a beautiful try set up
by Simon Rogers in a constructive
run which looked to have the Guy's
players floundering. Unfortunately
the try was not converted. The match
at this point was looking fairly even,
but without any change to the score,
until with a few minute remaining,
the stronger looking Guys' backs
scored a try and converted it, shortly
followed by a penalty kick. Half-
time score to 22-11 to Guy's.
The second half brought a tighter
defence to both sides and for the
most part the Marys' side spent a lot
of time in the Guys' half, without
being able to show anything for it,
despite some good runs by Rogers
and Elliot. After twenty-five minutes
with no score change Guy's scored
(again with two penalty kicks in a
couple of minutes).
Another Rogers run led to a flour-
ish of rucks which were Mary's
dominated and so moving them from
their own half deep into the Guy's
defence, but to no avail. The Mary's
players tried to keep their hopes up
but with five minutes remaining they
battled on. With a failed penalty kick
from Guy's, Mary's touched down
the ball, which led to a scrum, where
there was a Guy's try, but there was
no conversion. Full-time, and the
blood-bound Guy's team had won.
In all the match had a great buzz
about it, and in particular it seemed
that great attention had gone by
Mary's into practising their line-outs,
as Tremelling won a vast majority of
line-outs for them. Mary's may not
have won it this time, but will be
back next year in the final as they
have won the event twenty-nine
times in it's 122 year history.

Sedentary sport spectacular
A tense Saturday afternoon of card
play crowned the resurgence of IC
Bridge Club. ICBC has come second
for the past 2 years in the annual
London intercollegiate teams com-
petition, The Chelsea Cup, making
victory this year especially sweet.
Congratulations to the first team of
Dom 'the Bat' Goodwin, Joynur
'Planet' Rahman, Brian Wong and
Mark 'Zebby' Schaffer, who beat
LSE 1. by 21 VPs over 12 rounds.
This success is a sign of the
strength of the whole club, not just
our top players. IC's bridge club is
now more active than any other col-
lege's, fielding 5 of the 13 teams
competing in this event. For the
uninitiated of you, bridge is nothing
to do with old ladies' tea parties and
everything to do with skill, judge-
ment, beer and merriment (not nec-
essarily in that order). Anyone inter-
ested in this socially vibrant club -
come along to the Clubs Committee
Room on the top floor of the union
building 6pm any Tuesday night, or
contact g.cope@ic.ac.uk for details.
Beginners are always made wel-
come.
Finally, a special mention for the
5th team, who whopped the 4ths in
every way (except in the beer stakes
after the match...).
A sports editorial
This week's sports pages see a wel-
come contribution from the chess
and bridge clubs. Perhaps this will
encourage more of the "alternative"
sports clubs to write material as well.
This weekend sees the swordsmen
going for national BUSA glory, and
the football firsts and fourths further-
ing their respective title challenges.
See you next week, possibly.
Miners gotta lotta bottle
After five years of trying, the R S M
rugby team brought "The Bottle"
back to the union bar. The game was
a fiercely fought contest from the
start, Cambourne literally fighting
for the ball. The weight of the R S M
pack always meant that Cambourne
would struggle in the scrums, with
favour.
RSM took full advantage which
led to a try from Man of the Match
Stuart. Cambourne were quick to
come back with a forwards' try in the
corner. R S M replied from the kick-
off, after the first maul, the ball came
back to them. Jeff, the fly half, took
RSM taking several strikes against
the head early on in the game.
Special mention goes to our two
props Jamie and Murray for their
efforts. Lineouts were another of
RSM superiority, with Omar catch-
ing everything that came his way.
After twenty minutes R S M
opened the scoring with a try in the
corner from Matt. At half-time only
the one try separated the teams, but
now RSM had the wind in their
the ball and delivered a killer blow,
with a superb drop-goal from half
way.
With victory assured and with
hordes of cheering supporters wet-
ting themselves, it only remained for
the RSM to hang on for five minutes.
"The Bottle" was finally held aloft
by the R S M captain Martyn, and
now it sits proudly behind the union
bar.

Football fourths' title charge
After going a goal down as early as
the second minute, ICFC fourths
dominated the game. Although only
one-all at half-time we should have
been leading and the reasons for this
were bad misses by Pete, Darren and
Morgan. Darren came good in the
second half, completing his hat-trick,
and Adam put us four-one up. A
penalty was controversially conced-
ed late on in the game which keeper
Stu' almost saved. A good win for
IC, nearly confirming promotion.
