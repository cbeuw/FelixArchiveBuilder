Madness?
The G L C presents a
'Christmas Party for the
Unemployed'on the 21st
December from 3-11pm. The
G L C are subsidizing your
ticket by £6 so that you can
see the likes of Gregory
Isaacs, Imagination, Madness,
Marc Almond and Frank
Chickens all for the incredible
price of £2! All you have to
do is make your way to
Finsbury Park and find a
space in the Big Top there.
It'll be heated with the
necessary bars and food so
why not have one last fling
before they get rid of the
G L C next year. Tickets are

HaH-remember your Union

ifH And College...
Tomorrow sees perhaps the
best Christmas party around
College and despite the name
it's open to every IC student.
It features two bands
'Scrodingers Cat' and 'Duo',
which are both highly
recomended. The former
earning an unprecidented 3
encores at the recent RCS
Smoking Concert. Afterwards
there's the legendary IC Radio
Disco led by Ed Cartwnght
and Captain Scarlet hot off
the streets of New York. I
don't know how many of you
went to the Freshers Party
after the Life Sci Dinner in
October but most agreed that
it was the best party around
College for a long time. This
one promises to be in the
same mould. Don't miss it.
Tickets are only £1.50 in
advance from the RCSU
Office.

afford the air fare!
