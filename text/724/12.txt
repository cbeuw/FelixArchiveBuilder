The ICOrg""
FELIX has been the newspaper of Imperial College since 1949. In that time it has developed
from a tatty broadsheet Into professional newspaper. In the last 36 years it has reported on
everything from new halls to President's streaking arround the Albert Hall. In a special feature
Jane Spiegel describes the work required to produce FELIX every week.
FELIX first came out in
1949 as an alternative to
the Phoenix. Since then it
has developed from a
'sheet' to the weekly
students newspaper of
Imperial College.
Today, the paper has a
permanent staff of three
people. Firstly, there is the
editor, Hugh Southey this
year, who is elected on an
annual basis and has
sabbatical status. Then
there are Tony, the Printer,
and Rosemary, the Type-
setter. The rest of the
I FELIX Staff is made up of a
random assortment of
students from a wide cross-
section of the College.

Numbers fluctuate from
about twenty to thirty. The
amount of involvement and
contribution of individual
time vary considerably.
The paper is completely
independent of the Union.
In effect, this means that
the editor has the final say
in the paper's content and
cannot be dictated to by
Union Officers or College.
Obviously, there are the
legal obligations regarding
such matters as libel and
obscenity.
Folding
Before describing the
goings-on in the FELIX
office, it may be necessary
to explain a few terms,
which will crop up
repeatedly, for everyone
unfamiliar with the process
of producing a printed
piece of paper.
Some Jargon:—
Original copy—scraps of
paper with illegible scrawls
on them which accumulate
in unseemly little heaps all
over the place.
Typesetting—converting
the written material from
the original copy into a
typed form ready for
printing.
Proof reading— checking
the typeset for spelling,
punctuation, margins, size
of type etc.
Pasting up— chopping the
typeset into little bits and
glueing them onto a piece
of paper (extremely messy).
This is then imaged onto
an aluminium plate which
goes into the printing
press.
Folding— loading,
unloading and watching the
folding machine and
hoping it won't chew up
too many pages.
Collating— sitting at a table
putting the pages into each
other, end result—FELIX
with all pages in the correct
sequence.
FELIX is divided into a
number of different
sections. Responsibility for
certain pages, such as,
News, Arts, Reviews, Sport,
and What's On is given to
individuals. Often it is the
same person who is in
charge of a given section
each week. Normally, they
wil ask other people to
write parts of their page or
pages. However, it is up to
them to ensure that their
section is typeset, proof
read and pasted up in time
for printing.
Proof reading is always
done by someone other
then the writer. Most items
are proof read at least
twice by different people.
This is done by whoever is
in the office and isn't doing
anything else at the time.
The pasting up of Clubs
and the What's On Diary
gets foisted upon anyone
willing to do them.
Whenever there is an
event on in College or
outside which could be of
interest to students,
someone is sent out to
cover it. This can be a
debate, talk, play, meeting,
gig etc. Since the FELIX
office also has several
cameras, a keen
photographer will also be
despatched to try and get
some interesting pictures.
Though, depending on the
event, this may not always
be possible. The films are
developed by FELIX Staff
themselves.
The existence of the
Features section and the
occasional appearance of
Opinions and Specials
depends very heavily upon
individuals. The editor
keeps a file with ideas and
suggestions for features.
Some of these are planned
weeks in advance and
involve a great deal of time
and effort on the part of the
writer. Compared to many
other student newspapers,
FELIX has a large number
of articles relating to
scientific matters. It is
presumed that, as Imperial
is a College of Science and
Technology, this will be
agreeable to the majority of
its readership and cater for
their interests.
Occasionally, every now
and then, rarely, an opinion
article is handed in by
someone who has no
involvement whatsoever
with FELIX. These
extremely rare items are
received with great
excitement and are always
published (basically, it
means the staff have a
page less to panic about).
So, anyone out there who
has an obsession, a
passion, a need to put pen
to paper or just an axe to
grind—all donations will be
gratefully received.
The deadline for Letters,
Clubs, Societies, What's
On, Small Ads and Sports
(except Final Results) is on
Monday at 1.30pm. This
part of the paper relies
entirely on members of
College handing in their
original copy (those scraps
of paper). Predictably (?), it
seems to be always the
same Clubs and Societies
who present items for
inclusion. This is a shame,
especially since this
College has such a large
and varied number of active
clubs.
It should be pointed out
the the editor will not
accept anything handed in
anonymously. However,
anyone not wishing to have
their name published, only
needs to let the editor
know, and their name will
not appear.
