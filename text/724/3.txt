Sex Appeal
Dear Editor,
In a whole issue of FELIX
dedicated to sex, I was
rather disappointd to see
the rather marginalised way
in which homosexuality
was dealt with I also felt
that the subject was treated
somewhat inaccurately and
lacked sensitivity.
Prejudice against
homosexuals does not, as
your authors suggest, 'stem
from grossly misleading
impressions gained from a
small proportion of the gay
community'. It stems from
the fact that we live in a
society which consistently
suppresses and distorts the
images of lesbian and gay
lifestyles, and from the fact
that our society does not
validate any alternatives to
heterosexual, reproduction
orientated sexuality.
What in my opinion the
article fails to put across is
the sense that being gay in
London can be a most rich
and varied experience and
that despite the problems
of being 'out' in an
essentially traditional and
male-dominated
environment such as IC,
much support and
company can be gained
from getting involved in the
organisations that exist. No
matter how unsure or
unconfident you are about
your sexuality groups such
as ours provide a
framework for you to
explore your feelings. I
would like to welcome
anyone along to our
Thursday meetings at ULU
in Malet Street, WC1.
It is ironic that, in an
article intended to
represent homosexuality in
the 'sex special', there is no
mention of lesbians
whatsoever. If it is hard for
men to come out at IC due
to the male-dominated
males atmosphere, the
problems for lesbians must
be greater. Failure to even
acknowledge their
existence only serves to
reinforce the difficulties
faced by lesbian women
and to reconfirm the way
that straight men
consistently fail to realise
tha women can be
homosexual too.
I look forward to a more
postive and constructive
representation of lesbians
and gay men in your paper
in the future.
yours,
Jonathan Sheldon
Chairperson ULU Lesbian

Dear FELIX,
(This letter had to be
written in a very short
space of time to meet the
FELIX deadline. Please
excuse its brief and maybe
confusing nature).
At the end of October
Balloon Club asked
Quentin to book a Budget
van for the weekend of 30
Nov/1 Dec since all Union
vans had been booked out.
A simple enough task(?) Q
replied 'No need to book a
Budget, I can let you have
the 17 seater green minibus
by swapping with other
clubs'. Leaving the task in
Q's hands I go away
foolishly thinking all will be
well for our late November
trip and organise all the
other fiddly bits one needs
to.
As Nov 30 draws closer I
go and check with Q that
BC will definitely be able to
use B97 OLE (the green
van). 'YesT
, says Q 'The
green van will be yours,
don't worry'. I check with
Caving Club on Weds 27
Nov (the original bookers
of B97 OLE) to make sure
they know of the changes
Q has planned. Of course,
Caving knows nothing of
Q's plans, but are
agreeable to doing a swap
anyway since they can
make do with a smaller van.
On Thurs 28 Nov, with
only one day to go until the
weekend, Q tells me
Mountaineering must take
the green van and we will
have to make do with a
Budget van.
Confused by now? I was
bewildered! On the
morning of Friday 29 Nov I
call Q to check we have a
van. Q says, 'Yes, I've got
you a transit, but not a
Budget one.' This sounds
ominous! 'You will have to
go to Old Kent Road to
fetch the van I've booked
you'. By now I had realised
it was definitely going to be
'one of those weekends'.
Later, on Friday
afternoon after a two hour
expedition across half of
London to fetch the van I
discover Ford have brought
out a new type of Transit
disguised very cleverly as a
VW Van. Being much
smaller than a Ford Transit
we just managed to
squeeze the balloon into
the van and off we go.
Just outside London, on
the M1 the water
temperature gauge shoots
off into the red. The AA
man comes to our rescue
and disovers a faulty
temperature gauge. Off we
go agains determined to
enjoy our weekend. Luckily
we had no more trouble
with the van apart from the
drivers windscreen washer
that did not work.
Conclusion
Balloon Club asked
Quentin to book a van four
weeks before it was
needed. We were left
wondering which van we
would end up with and it
was Rugby club who used
B97 OLE on 30 Nov/1 Dec
so goodness know what
Mountaineering or Caving
used as transport.
I wasted four hours
collecting and returning the
van. A van which delayed
our journey and, in my
opinion, was an awful thing
to drive.
• Which club will the
phantom van swapper
strike at next? It could be
your club.
Mike Carpenter
Balloon Club Chairman
QT
Dear Mr Thomas,
I would like to take the
opportunity, on behalf of
QT Soc, to reply to the
criticisms you voiced in last
(week's letters page. It is all
to easy to sit back and
moan about something you
don't like; rising up off your
backside and doing
something positive about it
is considerably more
difficult. Even so here is an
opportunity for you to do
so.
As you would have
realised, if you had actually
bothered to read the QT
pieces, the society accepts
articles from anyone —
including non members. In
fact we are currently
holding 'write for QT'
competition. The best
submissions will be
published in FELIX.
With the sense of humour
you displayed in your letter
and your well thought out
ideas, it seems strange that
you have not yet submitted
an entry. However I look
forward to receiving your
submission with
anticipation on a similar
note, if you are unhappy
with the contents of FELIX,
there is nothing to stop you
making your own
contributions to the
newspaper.
Yours sincerely
W R Goodwin
