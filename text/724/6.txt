More On
Women's
Officer
IC Union is to have a
Women's Officer. A motion
to create the post was
passed at the IC UGfvl on
Tuesday 23rd December.
Proposing the motion,
Debra Exall said the
election of such an officer
would be the first step
towards an improvement in
conditions for women at IC.
Alan Rose, proposing an
amendment to the motion,
felt that the idea of a
special Women's Officer
would lead to the problems
in question being ignored
by the other officers, and
suggested that an inquiry
should be set up instead,
the results of which would
be presented at a future
UGM. When the
amendment was rejected, a
further amendment was
proposed, 'recommending
that there should be both a
Women's Officer appointed,
and an inquiry organised'.
This amendment was
carried.
Another motion to deal
specifically with sexism in
educational was passed
without question. Proposed
by Union President Carl
Burgess, the motion
supported the efforts of the
campaign for Women In
Science and Engineering
(WISE). ICU resolved to
press the University of
London to operate a
scheme in the city, with
each College Union
promoting the study of
engineering subjects by
schoolgirls in it's own
adopted borough.
The final motion to be
passed at the meeting
listed women students as
one of four topics to be
investigated under the
banner of Academic Affairs.
Dealing with a wide range
of subjects, J Martin
Taylor's motion was initially
accused of over-
generalisation. However, a
procedural motion forced
the meeting to an
automatic vote, and the
motion was carried.
Two further items on the
agenda remained
undebated by the end of
the meeting, including
Michael Newman's motion
on Union organisation held
over from two previous
UGM's. Tuesday's UGM
was called to a close as the
debate on this motion was
about to start.
A Question of Degrees
Graduates of the College's
four year engineering
courses will be awarded
Master of Engineering
(MEng) degrees as from
1987. Most three year
engineering courses
leading to BSc(Eng)
degrees will be
redesignated BEng degrees
at the same time.
The University of
London's Academic
Council has agreed to the
necessary change in the
University statutes. The
changes are now at a
consultative stage as
required by the University
of London Act 1978.
Following acceptance by
the University Senate the
statute changes must then
be ratified by the Privvy
Council. This long process
means that the changes will
not be in time for 1986
graduates to be awarded
the new degrees.
The delay in getting the
changes approved will lead
to some obvious anomalies.
Students graduating from
four year courses in 1986
will get a BEng, whereas
those graduating from the
same course the year after
will get a MEng. At the
same time those on three
year courses will get a
BEng which went to four
year course students the
year before.
Very Extremely Guilty
President Roger Preece
was tried at the Guilds
Christmas U G M in Mech
Eng 220 last Tuesday. In
his absence, Mr Preece was
accused of many crimes,
too many for the
prosecuting Council to list
but including; missing a dip
in the sea at Brighton,
refering to Boanerges, the
Union's mascot, as a 'she',
calling Mrs Ash, Mrs
Flowers and forgetting Mrs
Ash's flowers. Due to a
schedule clash, Mr Preece
was not available for the
trial, but in his absence, a
jury of six bad men and
false found him 'very, very,
very, extremely guilty'. He
was then sentenced to a
ducking in the serpentine.
An amendment to the
sentence suggested that
ICU Deputy President Dave
Kingston was equally
quilty. The judge agreed
and conferred the same
punishment upon him.
After the close of the
meeting, most of those
present moved to the
Senior Common Room and
bodily removed Mr Preece
from a Union Finance
Committee meeting. Mr
Kingston was left behind as
the Guildspersons felt he
would not be able to
control his temper. Mr
Preece was then carried to
the Serpentine and thrown
in. Despite frequent protest,
he was not too upset by the
experience and managed to
lead a resounding
boomalaka.
No Chance of Success
Last week the controversial
subject of President
Reagan's Strategic Defence
Initiative (SDI) was debated
in the Physics Department.
Speaking in favour of the
project were Dr Haines and
Professor Southwood, both
of Physics, and speaking
against were Professor New
and Dr Moss of Physics
and Computing
respectively. All of the
speakers agreed that the
so-called 'Star Wars'
project had virtually no
chance of success, and that
the idea of a defence shield
which could protect a
whole nation was sheer
fantasy. It was
acknowleged that there are
other reasons why the
American military are
interested in pursuing this
initiative, among them the
need to support the
defence industry.
Those against the project
said that it should be
vigorously opposed on
principle due to the
political instability which it
had already caused and
would continue to cause as
work progressed. Other
worries about the project
were based on the
restrictions which might be
put on groups in College
for security reasons once
military money had been
accepted, and the worry
that research done in the
name of defence might in
the end be used for
offensive purposes.
One More
for the
Road
Acting Union Bar Manager
Dave Brennan resigned last
week following the theft of
over £100 of bar takings
which were in his
possession. The money
was stolen at around
2.30pm on Thursday, after
Mr Brennan had left the
money poorly guarded for
a few minutes. He
submitted his resignation
after discussing the matter
with Refectory Manager
Rob Northey on Friday.
Mr Brennan was on his
way to deposit the takings
in the safe in Beit Arch
security office, after locking
up the bar. He stopped
briefly in the games room
to speak with a friend and
left the money on a shelf,
in a sealed plastic bag,
having removed it from his
pocket to get out a packet
of cigarettes. A few mintues
later he noticed that the
money had disappeared. Mr
Brennan immediately
checked the money had not
been picked up by any of
the Beit security guards or
cleaners, and then alerted
the Sherfield security office
and Assistant Refectory
Manager Martin Parsons.
Mr Parsons and Chief
Security Officer Geoffrey
Reeves rang the police at
2.45pm.
Mr Brennan was
interviewed by police on
Friday. He told FELIX that
the police were chiefly
concerned with discovering
whether he had taken the
money himself. He agreed
that the theft had been
largely a result of his own
negligence, but expressed
severe displeasure over the
attitude the police had
taken. They had thought it
unusual that he had
borrowed a sum of £50
from College as an advance
on his wages earlier in the
week.
Mr Brennan spoke with
Mr Northey later on Friday.
Mr Northey expressed no
ill-feeling towards Mr
Brennan but explained
sympathetically that he
could not overlook the loss
of the bar takings. Mr
Brennan was given the
choice of resigning or
being sacked, and chose to
resign. He is now working
in the refectories.
