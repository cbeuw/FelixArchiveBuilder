The Baker Perkins group has exciting career
paths starting next summer.
If you believe you have the ability and the will
to become a senior engineer in manufacture;
in mechanical, chemical or electronic design;
or in plant commissioning, then come and talk to us.
We design, manufacture and commission
market-leading automated process plant and
machinery for the food, printing, chemical and
packaging industries throughout the world: 75% of
our sales are overseas. We're growing rapidly; our
sales have more than doubled in the last four years.
Our success is based on a commitment to
meeting the total needs of our customers. This
involves research and development into products
and processes, supported by comprehensive test
facilities; design and manufacture (we're leaders in
the development of computer-aided design and
computer-integrated manufacturing systems);
we install and commission throughout the world.
We have a policy of continual investment in new
products; in advanced design and manufacturing
techniques and facilities. We invest heavily in our
people to stay at the leading edge of technology.
All this creates a wide range of challenging
opportunities for engineering graduates.
Let's talk.
