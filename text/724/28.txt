Deputy President's
Discourse
Rape Alarms
So far this term over 200
personal rape alarms have
been issued and are still
available from me in the
Union office, free of charge
to women students.
On the same subject
those of you who have
been in the ladies toilets in
the Union building will
have noticed a series of big
red buttons. These are
alarms and are connectd
into the Union Office Beit
Security desk and Union
Bar. The siren is a
persistant and nagging two
tone affair. If you hear it go
off DO NOT HESITATE to
go and investigate.
Room Bookings
These can be a pain in
the arse at times. When you
book a room, for heaven's
sake read what's on the
back of the booking form,
and allow time after the
event to clear up.
Personal Security
A number of people are
having their property
stolen. Quite frequently this
is because things are left
unattended. Don't leave
your bags, wallets,
calculators etc alone or
your room unlocked when
you are out. I came across
one case of a student who
had left his door wide open
for at least on hour. What
an idiot!
Security Guards
The Union Building
security guards generally
do a good job which is
surprising considering the
amount of shit they get
from some idiots. People
cause the guards no end of
hassle when they are going
about their business yet
still expect them to help if
it is needed. The security
guards look after your best
interests. Respect them for
that and help them.
Christmas
Finally I move on to a
happier note. Christmas is
coming up soon and no
doubt you still have some
presents to get. Why not
buy someone a book from
the Bookshop or some
regalia from the sports
shop. Both of these shops
are owned by you, the
students, this helps you in
the end.
Happy Christmas.
Dave Kingston.

Wine Tasting
On Wednesday 20
November the (Wine
Tasting) Society hosted the
IC heat of the Macallan
Junior Malt Taster
competition, a prestigious
annual inter-university
scotch whisky tasting
competition, which was
won last year by one of our
member.
The event involved a talk
and slide-show give by an
internationally known
i whisky expert, Mr Wallace
Milroy, followed by a blind-
tasting of 5 malt whiskies
whose region of origin and
brand name were to be
determined.
The heat winner was
Nick Battersby (EE1) who
received a bottle of 18 year
old Macallan malt whisky
and goes forward to the
national final, to be held in
Janaury at a top London
Hotel, there he will meet
the winners of 15 other
University heats.
The final prizes will
include 6 bottles of whisky,
a substantial cash prize and
a visit to the Macallan
Distillery in the company of
the Production Director.
Amnesty
International
The forgotten prisoners—a
campaign to release a
prisoner of conscience.
Who is going to defend
you if a totalitarian state
decides to imprison you
without trial, tortures you,
threatens you or your
family with violence or even
death, just for speaking
your mind? Who is going to
fight for the thousands of
men, women and children
who 'dissappear', murdered
because they did not
happen to agree with their
governments' opinions? In
nearly half the countries in
the world, some or all of
these things happen. It is
the responsibility of
everyone to stand up and
fight for human rights: If
people do not, they are
liable lose them.
At present, the IC Group
of Amnesty International is
campaigning for the release
of one such prisoner, who
is serving five years in a
'corrective' labour colony in
the USSR. Ivan Starovuit's
only crime was to
peacefully exercise his
right of freedom of
religious belief guaranteed
under article 18 of the
United Nations'
International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights
which was ratified by the
Soviet Union in 1973.
While a lot of pressure
from a ten persistent
individuals can be very
effective in improving the
condition of prisoners like
Ivan, governmente respond
much more when many
people write in to complain
about human rights abuses
against particular
individuals. For this reason
the IC group of Amnesty
International is launching a
campaign to get everyone
in College to write one
letter to the Ukrainium
authorities, mentioning
article 18 and asking for
the relerease of Ivan
Yakoulevich Starovoit. It
need only be a short letter.
If you want to find out
more about the case before
writing an information
sheet can be obtained
either from the FELIX
Office, Union Office or by
telephoning Charles
Penman 5777.

'Hey, Shei, you seen this?'
'What is it, Bobby?'
'ICMAC want to wish
everyone a Merry
Christmas and a Happy
New Year—even us in the
Close'
'Isn't that nice—look
especially those who have
paid their membership
subscription.'
'Look, Shei, why don't we
get Karen and Damien
membership for
Christmas—they'll like
that..."
'I'm sorry Tom, you have
power, wealth—everything I
could possibly want, but
ICMAC have more to offer
me'.
'Heather, I can get you fuel,
third party insurance and
even a six-channel
transmitter—just marry me'.
'I don't need your help—I
want to try to fly by

'Hey, Harry, look—'ICMAC
wish everyone a Merry
Christmas'—that's nice'.
'Huh! Students—I own two
houses in the close you
know. They don't mean us
old folk—they didn't send
Edna or me a card last
year, and I'll bet they gave
one to them theiving
Corkhills. They only really
mean the members of
ICMAC—I know—I worked
on the railways for forty
years and all that students
want is discounts and
freebies. It's me, the
taxpayer, who pays for
them to get drunk every
night and...'
