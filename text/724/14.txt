FELIX is not renowned for its generosity
when it comes to free gifts. Last year we
didn't give you one. The year before, you
got a cardboard cut-out Michael Arthur.
In the years before that, you had a
contraceptive smartie and a piece of
seaweed amongst others.
This year we are changing the
tradition! For once, we have come up
with a completely new idea. We are
giving you a present that will keep you
occupied throughout the Christmas
holidays....

AUSSIE'S No.l LAGER.
Have fun with him!
At least you can no longer complain about your Union President being inaccesible - you
can carry him with you everywhere! If you're that way inclined you can blow him up at any
time, though the attention might make him a little big-headed!
Your Blow Up Carl will behave just like the real thing. Blow him up and tie him to a broom
handle. Then tell him he has an important meeting to go to and he will fall over - just like the
real thing!
Fill him up with Lager and stick a pin in him to wake him up. He will piss all over your room
- just like the real thing!
Try to open him up so that he will talk to you. The only response you will get is a steady
stream of hot air - just like the real thing!
We are so confident that you will enjoy playing with your Blow Up Carl, that we are offering
a Â£5 prize to the person who suggests the most interesting/witty use for him.
Suggestions must reach the FELIX office before Wednesday 8th January.
