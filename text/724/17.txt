If It's Job security that you're after then don't become a
Father Christmas In a chain store when you graduate.
You'll be unemployed for 46 weeks every year, to say
nothing of the chance of catching measles or having tome
6-year-old throwing up on your false beard. Surely no-one
in their right mind would sit In a draughty grotto listening
to an apparently endless queue of children reeling out
their Christmas present lists (approximate value typically
£15,600), would they? Gren Manuel went to Debenhams,
Harrow, to interview two of their red-suited experts, and
also to try the Job on behalf of FELIX.
I hope Father Christmas
isn't in decline, but I can't
be sure. Some stores have
a no-platform for Santa
policy. Thankfully this isn't
the case at Debenhams
branch in Harrow.
Admittedly in previous
years old FC has arrived at
the store for the first time
in a horse-drawn carriage
accompanied by a
marching band, but may be
that is just a little too
much.
Certainly his Grotto is a
delight this year. They have
a teddy bear jazz band
standing, wrapped in
mufflers, in a snow covered
forest playing the Basin St.
Blues. Their arms, heads
hips and even cheeks move
as they strum and blow
their way towards the 25th
of December, illuminated
by a tasteful light display.
And at the end of the
grotto? Well, it's the man
himself, old Father
Christmas, grinning behind
his whiskers and yo-ho-ho-
ing, dispensing little gifts
and reminding children that
if they're not good little
boys and girls then they
won't get any presents.
John is an expert Santa.
He's been behind those
whiskers for four years at
this store alone (although
not without breaks,
obviously), and also does
other Santa—ing. He's
dispensed coal to
pensioners for the National
Coal Board, and when he
was in the RAF he used to
arrive at airbases with his
sack to find queues of little
scrubbed faces: the
children of the airmen. He's
obviously at ease with
children and they love him
for it.
Eric has been Father
Xmas for nowhere near as
long. He turned up to
Debenhams a few weeks
ago trying to get a little
temporary work on the run
up to Xmas, and was
offered the red suit. He
admits to being 'surprised'.
He was not formally trained
for the job, but
commonsense goes a long
way: don't talk down to the
children; when one Santa
goes for lunch arrange the
transfer so it is impossible
for any child to see two
Santas at once. He soon
got all but the most
petrified children out of
their shells.
And what of those chain-
store-Santa myths? Do
children attempt to pull the
beard off? Well, they .
couldn't if they tried. It is
attached by a piece of
elastic, and this means it
requires a gently guiding
influence to stop it from
riding up your face. With
one hand resting gently on
the whiskers no brat is
going to reveal the bare
flash beneath.
The other legend is that
of cantankerous Santas; the
job being given to a nasty
old man who drinks far too
much at iunchtimes and
arrives late only to breath
beery fumes all over
innocent, angelic four year
olds. John had worked with
one before. 'They had to
get rid of him, of course.'
Although some children
run giggling into Santa's
arms, this is not as
common as you might
think. After all, parents are
rightly concerned that their
son or daughter should not
talk or accept gifts from
strange men: Santa Claus,
giving out presents wearing
a ridiculous fake wig, fits
that description very well.
Thus many children,
especially younger ones,
are hesitant. However Eric
and John proved masters at
starting the youngsters
talking, sitting them on
their knee and getting them
to take their thumbs out of
their mouths (the child's
mouth that is). I sat and
watched these pro Santas
during the morning and
they had few very scared
children, and none cried.
Of course very young
children (two or less)
understood very little, but
they loved the teddy bear
jazz band (I defy you to go
and not tap your feet).
They were asked what
they wanted for Xmas, and
then always told that Father
Christmas would do his
best, and reminded to be
good. And what do these
budding capitalists want?
The class of 1985 want
Transformers, A La Carte
Kitchens, 'My Little Pony',
A-Team figures and
Cabbage Patch Dolls.
Whither Meccano?
They were always asked
their name and age. As the
gifts were in age and sex
categories Santa needed to
know whether he was
talking to a little boy or a
little girl, and as well as
being good Santa Claus
technique to call the child
by his or her name, it also
tells you the sex (almost
always). After just three
weeks Eric was able to
guess age with a 95%
success rate, but up to the
age of seven he still found
telling the sex tricky.
Neither Eric nor John did
much yo-ho-ho-ing. The
little ones are quick to spot
a lack of sincerity, and
natural yo-ho-ho-ers are
few and far between. Pity.
A little boy specifically
asked Eric to yo-ho-ho, but
that's the only time he's
done it. The presents were,
for 75p, remarkable value;
Plasticene, building bricks,
dolls, writing sets, all
packaged in big red
envelopes with teddy bears
on, and put into big toy
baskets. Much to my
disappointment no metal
badges were given and I
thought the Teddy bear
stickers were a pretty poor
substitute. I wouldn't take
£10 for my 'I saw Santa at
Shepherds Store,
Gateshead, Christmas 1972'
badge.
So I spent the morning
watching the professional
Santas at work, helping to
keep the toy baskets full,
and trying not to get in the
way. During one
particularly quiet period a
large group of streetwise
13-year-old refugees from
one of the local schools
drifted through. Like
everyone else they were
charmed by the teddy bear
jazz band, and after
watching that they had a
bit of a banter with FC, Eric
coping perfectly. After
giving a 'See you round,
Santa', all but one breezed
out. One precocious girl
remained; 'Ere Santa, why
didn't yer ask us what we
wanted fer Christmas'. Eric
grinned, 'I can't bring you
what you want for
Christmas...' .he said.
Lunch was my first
hurdle, and I nearly made
my first mistake. At the
Debenhams canteen I
almost ordered a cheese
and onion plel The effect of
this on my afternoon's
activities doesn't bear
thinking about. Fancy a
Father Christmas with
smelly breath?
Ready for battle, I
checked my equipment.
The tension on the belt
seemed OK; the red fluffy
suit fitted fine; the beard
itched slightly, and it had a
tendency to attempt to
crawl up my nose, but it
seemed reasonable.
Desperately trying to
remember Eric and John's
advice I placed my festive
bum on the big armchair at
the end of the grotto, and
prepared to wait. During a
Saturday maybe 400
children pass through the
grotto, but today,
Thursday, 100 would be
more usual. Thus there are
the occasional periods
where there are no victims
in the gunsights, and I had
time to adjust the toy
baskets and let my eyes get
used to the light. Then,
from behind a tuba-playing
teddy bear appeared a fee
paying customer, and with
Eric in mufti standing a
discrete distance away in
case of trouble, I beckoned.
I asked 6-year-old Lisa
what she wanted for
Christmas, told her to be
good, asked her to leave
me some milk and a mince
pie beside the chimney and
sent her, blinking, into the
main store again, her tiny
hands clutching a gift
suitable for her age and
sex. Seems easy. Then
trouble. I had my first
experience of a child
crying, something that I
had not seen Eric or John
having to cope with. He
started off toddling towards
me perfectly OK, I bellowed
'Hello young man, have you
come to see me?'( an
obviously rhetorical
question, as who else
