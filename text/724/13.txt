The news—that most ».
fickle of creatures—can be
a bit of a headache. The
sources are haphazard,
random and variable. Many
news items originate from a
rumour or a garbled
version of something which
could have happened, but
then again perhaps it
didn't. This term has been
dominated by the
continuing saga of the
Union Bar. The process of
covering this story is not
very different from any
other item which is
considered to be
newsworthy. A lot of time is
spent telephoning people
who never seem to be in. If
they are in, it can be
extremely difficult to get a
coherent answer to
questions. At other times .
when a budding reporter is
sent out to speak to one of
the 'stars of the story',
conflicting replies are
brought back to the office.
However, most people are
very helpful when it comes
to answering quesitions.
Finally, the headlines have
to be written. The
suggestions invariably tend
from the ridiculous to the
absurd, with not much in
between. Once the
headlines are done, the
office receives its weekly
tidying up followed by the
last print run, folding and
then collating.
The people working on
FELIX cannot be placed
into nice, neat categories.
Their involvement varies
from a couple of hours a
week to those individuals
who are permanent fixtures
and have become part of
the office furniture. Their
interests and opinions on
politics etc differ
considerably. What makes
them do it is a mystery.
One suspects the
availability of tea and
coffee has a crucial role to
play and that the
withdrawal of this
sustenance could lead to
industrial action of the
most severe nature (Ed,
take note!). This would be
an undesirable state of
affairs.
The contents of FELIX
can be divided roughly into
two halves. One half is
determined by the editor
and the people who work
regularly on FELIX and is
decided at staff meetings,
the other half is solely
under the control of the
rest of college. All students
have the opportunity of
contributing to their paper,
either with articles etc or
suggestions. This way they
can influence the contents.
and ensure that FELIX
contains things of interest
to as large a number of
people as possible.
Making coffee.
Concentrating over a paste up.
