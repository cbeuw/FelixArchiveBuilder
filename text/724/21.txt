Yes, it's that time of year
again. Not only is it the
season of good will, but it
is also the season of peak
cinema attendences in
Britain and as such the
time for the distributors big
releases, often big summer
hits in America (summer
being their peak time). This
film is not one held over
from the summer, it's the
highly seasonal Santa
Claus, the Movie (Odeon
Leceister Sq). (The movie
presumably being added to
avoid confusion with any
other Santa Claus).
This 'movie' is a fine
example of American
cultural imperialism,
extolling the delights of
capitalism, and even
portraying Coke and
McDonalds as desirable
commodities. Santa Claus
himself is a large,
benevolent American ruling
over a
kingdom
populated
to the North Pole to enable
them to deliver toys to all
the children in the world.
But as the population
increases this task
becomes harder and Santa
chooses a helper, Patch,
cutely played (as ever) by
Dudley Moore. Patch's
attempts to help go wrong
and in his self-imposed
exile he teams up with the
unscrupulous BZ. When
once again things go
wrong, largely due to the
evil BZ (boo, hiss!!) it is up
to Santa Claus, Joe, an
orphan, and a nice guy, to
save the day.
Unspecial Speilberg
The remarkable Steven
Speilberg has his name
associated with two major
recent releases, Back to the
Future, reviewed later, and
The Qspnies. His
obsession with
kids has
by small
subserviant British
Elves and the deprived
child in the story is, of all
possible kids in the world,
a healthy, white ,
intelligent, American child.
The music is often sickly
supermarket songs and the
sets and costumes are
I largely twee. That's the
intellectual response, the
emotional response casued
! me to sit through the film
I with damp eyes, a lump in
I my throat and a stupid grin
on my face. I'm sorry I
i couldn't help it.
The story in this case
i concerns a childless
toymaker and his wife who
are magically transported
finally let him down; the
children who star in this
story, and who are meant
to be seen as cute, only
come across as annoying
and even frequently crude.
Because their parents
have seemingly given us
hope of saving their
dockside homes, it is left
up to their offspring to do
something about it on their
final weekend together. The
seven saviours are: Mi key,
the fairly weak leader,
Brad, his sadistic brother;
Chunk the lovable, clumsy
fat one; Mouth, fast talker;
Dale, resourceful would-be
James Bond and token
ethnic minority, oh and I
nearly forgot two token
girls, Andy and Stef, whose
only purpose is to provide
the sexist cinema
stereotypes as the
screamers and the love
interest. (Actually that's not
quite fair, the writers have
graciously allowed Andy
some musical ability, well I .
suppose that's sufficiently
genteel for girls to do).
Fortunately for the
Magnificent Seven, Mikey's
father, the local museum
curator happens to have a
treasure map in the attic,
which then leads them off
on the trail for One-Eyed
Willie's booby trapped
treasure and across the
path of the baddies (Who
are not only adult, but also
foreign, oh dear, oh dear). I
kept finding myself wishing
that the evil Fratelli's would
catch Indiana Junior and
the assembly of goons.
A scene early on sets the
standard of humour for the
film when the gang
desperately attempt to
replace the genitals that
have broken of a small
Greek statue. This then
leads to more below the
belt jokes as the bad guys
are repeatedly hit in that
region, hysterical. To
summarise, it I haven't
â€¢ already made it clear, The
' Goonies is neither funny
nor exciting, and I'd like to
think that if it wasn't for
Speilberg's name it would
never have been made.
Steven Speilberg has also
produced Back To The
Future, an infinitely better
film about a time travelling
boy. The problems of
causality, so much enjoyed
by writers of science
fiction, are used largely for
comic effect as Marty, t
Michael J Fox, is
transported in time to 1955
when his parents first met.
This choice of time not
only opens up all the
possibilites of affecting the
future, but also allows for
some interesting Freudian
ideas as Marty's mum
fancies him.
No time like the present
The comic ramifications of
this situtation are
effectively, but not
excessively, exploited and
the final climax is very
excitingly portrayed by
director and co-writer
Robert Zemeckis
The particular pleasure of
this film is the balance;
between character acting
and believable reaction,
and between the credible
and the incredible. This is
