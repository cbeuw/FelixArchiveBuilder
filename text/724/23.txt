Mexican scenery is
described with clarity -the

and bright green cultivated
valleys. There is no climax

' P r r ^ f W v e m t j e r 1939,
underlined byjhe presencf-
of German submarine
officers, and all the way
through run subtle threads
of tension and fear. The
alcoholic ex-Consul dies
falling down a ravine on the
Day of the Dead, when the
Mexicans take food to the
graves of their departed
While his ex-wife, Yvonne,
and his brother-in -law are
looking for him during a
thunder storm, the Consul
in delerium releases a
panic stricken horse which
charges at Yvonne and kills
her. With a perculiar sense
of deja vu you realise that
the same horse entered the
story earlier, and that all
later events are
forshadowed by former
decisions. The Consul
shooting wooden ducks at
a fair is the same man who
kills his wife, the same who
never had the guts to say 'T
can never forgive you
deeply enough' to her.
Stream of consciousness
takes over as the Consul
collapses into drunkeness;
the mescal that he takes is
also a narcotic and used as
a drug by Indian mystics.
Towards the end the story
is that of the Book of Job;
no-one can observe the
suffering of man who hates
himself and remain silent.
The various strands of hate
and love, sexual imagery,
drunkeness, black magic,
death and damnation are
drawn together as the
Consul crashes down
towards the trees.
This wonderful book is
published by Penguin,
costs £3.95 and is well
worth reading.
Well Christmas time is here ;
again, and for some of you
that may mean being
invaded by hordes of
screaming nephews, nieces
and cousins. I suppose you
could escape by taking
residence in the bar of your
local pub, but if your
mother wants some peace
and quiet while she's
stuffing the turkey why not
take the little brats to see
The Secret Diary of Adrian
Mole, Aged 13?/-f ?
I know what you're going
to say -something along
the lines of 'but that's
bleeding kids stuff, all that
pantomime/and secret diary,
of Adrian whatsit.' Well, I'd
tend to agree about the
THEATRE
pantomime -I mean, who
really wants to watch
Russel bloody Grant
poncing about on stage
wearing someone else's
dress? But the fact remains
that you'd be wrong about
'Secret Diary'. It does
appeal to both kids and
adults (and even students!).
Even my parents, who only
usually like anything that's
about four hours long and
happens to trace the
history of the British
Empire from start to finish,
enjoyed it. So there you go.
I suppose that's enough
about my parents, so how
about the play? Well, for
those of you who haven't
read the book,, basically it
tells the story of a year in
the life of Adrian Mole -
how he copes with falling
in and out of love, spots,
his dog running away, his
parents splitting up and his
poetry being rejected by
the B B C . The observations
on the problems of
adolescence are incredibly
acute, so at times you'll be
left squirming with
embarassment as you
remember the time when....
The script follows the
book fairly faithfully, so it's
extremely funny. Some of
the musical numbers made
me cringe a little (the only
accompaniment being a
poky little synthesiser), but
the set and cast are very
good.
All in all a very good time
to be had by all the family.
