Look Back In Anger
Overworked FELIX reporter Bill Goodwin takes
another look at this term's news.
The news in this term's
FELIX has undoubtedly
been dominated by the
Union bar. Strong feelings
were first aroused when
Refectory Manager Rob
Northey miscalculated bar
price rises. Two weeks later
Bar Manager, Doug
Armstrong and barman
Brian Ellison resigned after
an argument with Mr
Northey. Mr Northey was
critical of their
arrangements for the bar
facilities during the freshers
New Year's Party; he felt
that an extra can bar was
needed. Mr Armstrong and
Mr Ellison said they had
put a lot of work into the
bar and pointed out they
had taken almost Â£3374,
which was a record for the
New Year's Party. They felt
that Mr Northey's
comments could only be
taken as a vote of no
confidence and thus they
felt obliged to resign. Ugly
scenes followed when
students in the Union Bar
learned of the resignations.
At the next UGM it was
decided to organise a
seven day bar boycott to
demonstrate the Union's
dissatisfaction. The boycott
proved very successful and
College Secretary John
Smith agreed to plan a
Union takeover of the Bar
with IC Union President
Carl Burgess. Later it
transpired that he wanted
the Botany-Zoology
common rooms and the
Lounge for conversion into
lecture theatres. The
Biology Department
required the rooms so that
academics from Ashurst
Lodge could be
accommodated when the
Lodge is sold.
Meanwhile another
barman, Tony McVey,
failed to open the Union
Bar one Saturday and was
promptly sacked by Mr
Northey. Mr McVey claimed
that his absence was due to
a mild form of food
poisoning.
Agreement was finally
reached between the
Rector, Professor Ash, and
Mr Burgess over the Union
bar's future. The Union will
be taking financial control
of the bar on January 1. In
FELIX
return the Bot-Zoo
Common Room will be
converted into a lecture
theatre, and the Union
Dining Room and Senior
Common Room are to be
hired out in the mornings
to the Biology department.
Professor Manny
Lehman's decision to
accept a contract for
research into software for
the 'Star Wars' project was
more than a little
controversial. Many
members of the Computing
Department believed that
the software required
would either prove too
complex to work, or that it
would be unsafe; the
greatest danger coming
from the errors in the
program which could
remain undetected until the
program was executed.
Head of Department,
Professor Bruce Sayers
was concerned that work
on SDI would divert scarce
resources away from
current projects such as
the Alvey program.
Professor Lehman agreed
that SDI would not work,
but explained that the
politicians would not
believe this until it had
been proved.by research.
He took the stance that SDI
research was essential and
would have enormous
benefits for society.
The exploits of the
'Phantom Soaker'
dampened many an ego
this term. The Soaker is
reputed to have tipped bin
liners of water over more
than 30 gentleman as they
sat in cubicles in the
College conveniences.
Among those caught "with
their trousers down' were
IC Union President Carl
Burgess and Chief Security
Officer Geoff Reeves. Mr
Reeves made unprintable
threats against the Soaker,
when and if he should be
caught. Two letters signed
by the Soaker were
delivered to FELIX. They
were in different styles of
handwriting; only the
earlier letter is believed to
be genuine. Despite Mr
Reeves' attempts to analyse
the hand-writing, the
identity of the Soaker
remains a mystery.
Southside hit the
headlines once more this
term. Strong feelings were
aroused over the kitchen
facilities. Residents
complained about the
modification work in
progress. The original
intention was to install
kitchens on each stairway,
replacing the old kitchens
on the gallery level with
bedrooms. These proposals
had been agreed by the
Student Residence
Committee the previous
year. The Southside Hall
Committee claimed that the
residents had not been
consulted enough, and
expressed their concern
that noise and smells from
kitchens would interrupt
the Hall's social set up.
Residents of Southside
signed a petition
supporting an alternative
idea, proposing to extend
the original kitchen by
placing the tables and
lockers elsewhere. Carl
Burgess supported this
petition, which was
delivered to Peter
Hallworth, the Managing
Surveyor of Residences. Mr
Hallworth eventually agreed
to its proposals. Falmouth
Keogh Hall, however,
elected to opt for the
stairway kitchens.
Much uproar was caused
by the Union's ban on this
year's Rag Mag. It was
described by Mr Burgess as
'shocking, disgusting and
appalling'. The president of
City and Guilds, Roger
Preece, warned that
Imperial could become
'more renowned for its
obscenities than for its
excellence' if the Rag Mag
were released.
The ban was imposed
because of doubts as to the
legality of the publication,
from which the printer's
name had been omitted,
and the dubious nature of
its contents.
During the UGM the
Union sabbaticals were
criticised for not checking
the contents of the Rag
Mag before it was printed,
as they are empowered to
do. It was agreed that a
censorship committee
would be formed for next
year's magazine.
The ban was ultimately
lifted in the interests of
Rag. The Rag Mag
appeared in its original
form, apart from the
addition of printer's name,
which was stamped in.
Reactions from many
students were positive.
Wacky Education Minister Sir Keith
Joseph appeals for the return of
his false teeth, during his visit
to IC this term.
