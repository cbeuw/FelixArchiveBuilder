would someone go into
Santa's Grotto to see?), he
burst into tears, did a 180
degree turn, and ran
bawling back into the folds
of his mother's coat. It can
be difficult enough to stop
a young boy from crying,
without being prevented
from communicating with
him by a fake set of white
whiskers and an ill-fitting
wig.Later, after a little
advice from Eric, I coped
much better with my
second cryer. Give them
the present, start the
conversation and keep it
going, on your own if need
be. Natural curiosity soon
surfaces (why does he look
so funny?), and soon
enough they'll be telling
you what you ought to be
dropping down their
chimney.
Again another pause.
You can't get out a book,
or have a quick game of
darts during these lulls, you
just have to drum your
gloved fingers against the
arms of the comfy chair.
Next was a group from a
nursery school, 15 of them
lining up in their little blue
pom-pom hats - some
brash, some not, one
crying, and two teachers
straight out of Joyce
Grenfell record. They sang
me We Wish You a Merry
Christmas and I shook
them all by the hand.I liked
that bit especially.
Sometimes the children
were outgoing and
extrovert, their parents
standing well back. I could
sit them on my knee, talk to
them, ruffle their hair;
great. 'Thank you Father
Christmas', after I gave
them a gift, 'Merry
Christmas Father
Christmas'. 'Merry
Christmas Nicola', I'd say.
Some were less sure,
looking at their mother and
hiding their face in their
hands. All the children
thanked me for the gift,
though some required a
little prompting from their
parents.
FCs work one hour on,
one hour off (it says so in
the Elf and Safety at Work
Act), so it wasn't long
before John knocked on
the plywood of the grotto
wall. I waited for a pause
and then darted into a side
door, with John appearing
seconds later to resume the
task... I removed the
whiskers and asked Eric
how I could improve. My
main problem was
confidence, or the lack of
it, as Santa is supposed to
be big, bouncy and
bombastic. Even though I
was not nervous my lack of
confidence in my ability
sometimes showed,
although at first when he
told me this I was surprised
that anything could show
through the nylon whiskers
that covered 85% of my
face.
My spare hour was spent
looking round the toy
department at some of the
toys I had been asked for.
Most were TV advertised,
made of plastic, and
expensive. Not a single
child had asked for a board
game, or a train set;
strange. My hour as a
sabbatical Santa passed
quickly, and soon I was
back in the whiskers. I
thought that being wrapped
up in all that rig would
make me hot, but this was
not the case, although if
the grotto was full of
people then presumably the
temperature would rise
considerably. However I
have a genuine (non-nylon,
non-removable) beard, and
maybe FCs with no facial
hair of their own find the
whiskers less easy to wear..
As my confidence rose I
felt I became a better
performer: 'Do you know
what reindeer eat?', 'My,
you have a nice red scarf
on'. One little girl even
kissed me.
I gave one little chum the
wrong sex present, but Eric
was on hand to do a swap.
Then, as I got into the
groove, Eric left, and I was
on my yo-ho-own as the
children crept, strolled and
ran into my Grotto, though
none attempted to pull my
beard. Surprisingly I never
once felt that the parents
were being dragged into
the grotto unwillingly. If
both parents were there
then they typically stood
holding hands, grinning, as
I told little Martin what it
was like to live at the North
Pole. Once or twice I got
hints from the parents what
to say. Some parents
wanted me to give more
specific guidelines on the
spherey of behaviour upon
which modificaion must be
enacted, prompted and
mouthed, about going to
bed on time or eating
cauliflower. I was asked if I
was going to be at a
particular school party. The
parent nodded furiously,
and so I felt confident in
saying that, yes, I would be
there.
And what were the
clients like? The age range
I had to deal with was from
8 months right up to 11
years. Obviously those of 8
months didn't get much
more than a hairy grin and
a present, but some older
children didn't have english
as their mother tongue, and
I felt rather helpless as they
looked up at me, expecting
me to say something. After
all, a Father Christmas who
couldn't speak English
would have confused me
when I was seven. Soon
(maybe too soon) my stint
was over. I returned to
normality by removing the
red coat and white beard,
and trotted round the
grotto entrance where I
chatted to Santa's friend
operating the till at the
entrance to the grotto.
They do get occasional
complaints that the teddy
bears don't play very festive
tunes, but I was pleased to
find out that no-one had
complained about my
conduct, though one
mother had commented
that I did look rather young
for a Father Christmas. As
Eric has a daughter older
than me, and John is
retired I suppose that my
only-slightly-older-than-
teenage looks don't quite fit
the bill. Just wait until I get
a nice long white beard
though, and I'll be first in
the queue for jobs next
Christmas.
W*4
You could say that chain
store Santas are a cynical
gimmick reinforcing the
capitalist consumer ethic in
impressionable children.
You might even believe it.
More fool you. I don't think
that the Le Grot de Santa
comes even close to
making a profit for
Debenhams once all the
overheads have been added
up, but they aren't a
charity, and I guess that
they believe that it justifies
itself in the increased toy
sales. However I believe
that this is at the expense
of other stores, and doesn't
arise from children putting
more pressure on their
parents for more expensive
presents. I certainly saw no
signs of anguish on parents
faces when their pride and
joy reeled off a long list of
wants, though I don't know
whether it was because the
parents had cooly decided
not to get little Crispin a
full size slate bed billiard
table or they thought that
the Â£1500 was quite
reasonable for a Christams
present. Things might have
been different in this
respect if I had been a
santa in Liverpool instead
of Harrow.
FC at Debenhams,
Harrow, provides a good
service. Surely only a real
Scrooge would deny
children and their parents
10 minutes in Santa's
Grotto once a year?. Merry
Christmas..
FELIX would like to thank
Santa Eric, Santa John and
all of the gnomes and
fairies at Debenhams.
