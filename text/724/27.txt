Mega-Brain in league with Energise Spock Campaign have
produced six puzzles to titilate your intellect. The Electric
Nightmare and the crossword are prize puzzles. £5 will be given
to the sender of the best solution to each. In the unlikely event
that you finish them in time, send your answers to the FELIX
office on or before January 8th.
Electric Nightmare
Here's a problem that'sbeen
causing some sleepless
nights in the Physics
Department recently. Given
an infinite grid of 1 O H M
resistors, as shown below,
what is the effective
resistance across any one
resisitor?

f=3

Although this would
seem like a complicated
electronics problem, its
solution requires no
knowledge above a-level
Physics, but is so clever
that I thought it demanded
publication. Please provide
your entire solutions as I
could do with a good
laugh.
Punctuate the following so
that it makes sense:

TT Soc
This puzzle concerns one
of IC's most secretive and
elite clubs, of which there
are known to be at least 13
members. I speak , of
course, of teetotal soc. The
president, Ann, and the
secretary, Bob, were
recently heard discussing
how many members of TT
soc the were in Bob's
Department, which had
1300 people in all.
'Is it over 500?' asked Ann.
Unfortunately, Bob had
sneaked down to the bar
at lunchtime and was prone
to lying while under the
influence, so he did.
'Is it a perfect square?' She
asked, again he lied.
'Is it a perfect cube?'
This time he told the truth.
'If you now tell me whether
the second figure is a one,
I'll be able to tell you the
number', said Ann.
Bob told her, and she told
him the number, but she
was wrong. How many
people in Bob's department
were in TT Soc?
