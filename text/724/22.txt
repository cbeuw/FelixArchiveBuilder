the Christmas film.
(Empire, Leceister Square
Plaze)
The man who was
responsible for the highly
stylish Bladerunner and
Alien, Ridley Scott, has
done a great deal of
research into mythology for
his latest film Legend
(Leicester Sq Theatre), an
epic fairy tale. This
research concentrated
particularly on the
Living legends
occurence of a Jack o'the
Green character in
Northern European
mythology. However all this
effort is wasted as Ridley
Scott appears to have
expended all his effort on
creating the right visual
style, albeit an
astonishingly beautiful one,
and very little effort on plot
and characterisation, a
point not helped by the
casting of the rather poor
Tom Cruise as Jack.
The main thrust of this
tale, like all good fairy tales
is that the battle of good
and evil, embodied in this
case by the Lord of
Darkness, played by the
marvellous Tim Curry
whose gorgeous voice is
suitably demonic for the
role. Because the Lord of
Darkness is fatally allergic
to sunlight he plans to rid
the world of the unicorns
that maintain the harmony
and light and plunge the
land into darkness.
Unfortunately not enough
care was taken
over the development of
these characters or the plot
so the film comes across as
vacuous, but a sumptuous
feast for the eyes. Although
this is due largely to the
remarkable visions of Scott,
it would be remiss to fail to
mention the impressive sets
and incredible make-up
particularly on Tim Curry
and Robert Picardo as Meg
Mucklebones.
Finally of the films aimed
largely at children is an
unusual one, Tuff, Turf. It
is unusual because it
alienates the audience that
it is obviously aimed at and
to whom it would appeal
most by virtue of the
graphic violence at the end
and the subsequent 18
cetificate. The violence is
the precipitation of the
designs of the new kid in
town, from a rich
background, on the local
gang leader's girlfiend.
Although it is a well-worn
story and director
incorporates some clever
ideas, and some of the
Tough enough?
scenes are very involving,
but there are also some
truly dire moments, such as
when our hero serenades
the girl at the country club.
It's an average sort of film,
but unfortunately for it's
normally imaginative
distributors, Blue Dolphin
Films, it is likely to be
unfairly ignored in the face
of Christmas competiton.
Happy Christmas, all.

Elem Klimov has recently
received a lot of publicity,
in the film world at least,
for his recent anti-Nazi film
Go and S e e shown at the
film festival. But until that
film is released it is
possible to see some of this
talented film maker's work
in the form of the nine year
old Agony (Camden Place,
Chelsea Cinema). It has
taken so long to reach the
screen here because the
Soviet authorities felt that
this story of Rasputin
portrayed Tsar Nicholas II
too sympathically.
The film is set in 1916
when Russia was a
particularly corrupt and
unjust society, with
merciless exploitation of
the workers, police tyranny,
hunger and devastation.
Against this backdrop, the
Tsar felt that only a miracle
would save the Empire and
enable the generals to
crush the rebels as they
had done in 1905.
Enter Rasputin, powerfully
played by Alexi Petrenkov,
an illiterate Siberean
peasant, ex-horse thief, and
wandering monk. Curing
the sick and uttering
strange speeches he
rapidly acquires the
complete confidence of the
Tsarina and hence wields
great influence in the
Russian court.
The film uses a mixture of
documentary footage, black
and white and colour film
to intelligent effect, and the
Ra Ra Rasputin
shots of faces particularly
are impressively composed
and lit. A film with a title
like Agony readily lends
itself to abuse by critics
and I'm sure that alot of my
colleagues will make some
witty comments about it,
probably in reference to it's
length, two and half hours,
but I didn't find that time
dragged and I was quite
impressed, though I don't
expect that this will be
everyone's idea of a good
night out.
David Hare usually writes
very intelligent works,
Wetherby, Pravda, and his
recent adaptation of his
own stage play, Plenty
(ABC Shaftsbury Av) is no
exception. It contrast's the
desire of it's impatient lead,
Susan, to move on against
the unfulfilled optimism of
post-war Britain. Through
the use of some cleverly
sketched characters the
insidious class-
consciouness and snobbery
of the British is brought to
light. An example of the
high quality of both the
acting and also the writing
is the charcter of Sir
Andrew Charleson, whose
brief, but brilliant
appearance epitomises the
restraint and sense of
propriety that Susan finds
so frustrating.
Following her experience
with the French Resistance
in the War, a time when she
felt that she could see the
Lie back and.
best of people in an hour,
she longs for a change that
she feels can happen in the
new Britain. But failing to
fjjpd any change or the
passion she felt with Lazar,
Sam Niell, during the war,
she settles for the
sympathy and comfort of
the diplomat Raymond
Brock, Charles Dance.
Hare's decision to
concentrate on the world of
diplomacy emphasises the
qualities in the British
...think of Britain
which so annoy Susan and
in which, as Sir Andrew
says, the British lead the
world.
The characters are all very
well played with John
Geilgud as a senior
diplomat, Tracey Ullman as
a friend providing some
laughs, and Sting, as the
lower class sentimental
lover, very capably
delivering the epitaph, 'You
people are cruel and
dangerous. You fuck
people up'. This is a
shrewd observation as the
characters are largely
unpleasant and
unsympathetic, giving the
audience little to identify
with. But inspite of this the
wonderful photography and
skillfully understated
direction by Fred Schepisi
manages to involve the
audience in this fine film.
