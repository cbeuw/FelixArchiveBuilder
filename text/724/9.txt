Somewhere in this article it
would seem appropriate to
express some seasonal
sentiments. So without
further ado may I suggest
that this Christmas you
uphold the spirit of IC in
carrying on ancient
traditions and go down to
Stonehenge and sacrifice a
virgin/hippy/sabbatical or
whatever else takes your
fancy.
One of ICs oldest centres
of tradition, dating back to
the early twenties, is the
Union Bar. Trust this
erstwhile institution to
come to the aid of sweating
news editors this year by
supplying plentiful
controversy. And if I'm not
mistaken there's more
brewing in the pipeline. It
would seem that at long
last the Union will be
running Its own bar, and
rightly so. The question
now is how it will run in
future. Even the most
experienced union hacks
seem at a loss to provide
answers. It seems that
rather than being wrested
from the grip of a
draconian college
authority, Sherfield were
almost glad to be rid of the
bar, and, further, that they
might see it as a way of
foisting some of their other
problems on to the Union.
With the Union due to
become responsible for the
running of the bar in early
January there is little news
available on how this will
be achieved. It was
reported by witnesses that
at a recent bar committee
meeting refectory manager
'Honest Rob' Northey was
seen chortling at Union
deputy president Dave
Kingston about the way he
was 'running circles'
around the hapless
sabbatical. It seems that
when the Union takes
control it will be
responsible for all aspects
of the bar, and that at
present Mr Northey is
preparing to run the bar
down to a minimum level at
the end of term. This little
problem is nothing to the
one of finding someone to
run the bar. Rumours
abound about old barmen
and friends of union hacks
being selected before the
job is even advertised to
such an extent that I
cannot even dream of
suggesting any one of them
Is true. At the moment the
bar is in a sad state, the
system of taking union
cards for pots still breaks
down, there seems to be
regular vandalism and
• some of the people who
might revive the
atmosphere seem to have
forsaken the place totally.
The more unkind among us
have suggested that the
whole business has less to
do with sound economic
reasoning and a lot more to
do with the pseudo-
freemasonry that surrounds
certain tie clubs. Further
than this I do not intend to
comment lest I be struck
down by the 'curse of the
bar' or found stabbed in the
heart with my left trouser
leg rolled up.
On to more mundane
matters. After a while
rumours about who's
'bonking' with who get
remarkably tedious, and
anyway I mustn't let the
tone of this article fall too
low. However there are
exceptions, especially for
people with cleaner-than-
clean reputations. One
such is genial Guilds
president and notorious
self-promotionalist Roger
Preece. This is not to judge
Mr Preece in any way, for
as he says in the recent
FELIX Sex special, it is the
Christian way to follow the
biblical teaching to the best
of one's ability not to imply
any absolute judgement.
However the extent of Mr
Preece's latest infatuation
must raise some questions
of a moral nature. The
object of his attention is a
young lady in Mines but
beyond that it is not polite
to be more precise. Friends
have let slip that our hero
has been making
clandestine enquiries after
the young lady for a
considerable amount of
time, although he called off
trying to take her to an
army dinner when he
discovered to his dismay
that she had a current
boyfriend. However the
course of true lust held
strong and the dashing
lieutenant persisted in his
quest at every possible
opportunity until he was
recently disturbed by a
close friend of mine with
some of his clothes a touch
awry, shall we say (this
phrase is approved by the
Felix Sex Editor as suitable
for the general public).
However the matter which
has really brought this case
to my attention is the
prestigeous cocktail party
being thrown by Guilds to
promote itself to
(potentially generous)
parties from outside
college. The guest list has
'been limited to a very
exclusive list of Guilds
students who are to be
there to act as hosts to the
various mayors, MPs and
captains of industry.
Surprise then to find that a
certain friend of our
illustrious president
appears on the same list for
what is 'a serious occasion
for the promotion of the
image of Guilds union and
in no way a freebie for
hacks'. When questioned
about this Mr. Preece said
he had decided that there
was room for 'other
students' to help out in an
assisting role. Believe
nothing on the basis of
public image
Speaking of misleading
public image, IC closet
romeo Dave Kingston has
been letting himself in for it
again. Apparently his life is
being made difficult by the
number of complaining
students being sent to him
by student services. It has
been suggested by people
with connections in that
part of college that Dave's
troubles are due to the fact
that he has recently jilted
one of the female
employees. Not content
with ignoring advice over
the bar, it seems that
sabbaticals are not aware
of the well known sayings
about 'women scorned'.
As this is a special
edition I think it's about
time some of our esteemed
editor's excesses were
brought to light (especially
as he tells me to write
some of this stuff). Hugh
has recently begun playing
hockey for the IC 3rd team
which may well explain
some of the content of the
sports pages these days.
But before you jump to any
conclusions about our
man's sporting skills I
should comment that, from
personal experience, 3rd
team fixtures are very much
a social activity. Now jovial
Hugh is not one to shy
away from being the life
and soul of the party and
has been seen on several
occasions to be well
'refreshed' after matches.
More interesting still is
the'regard in which Hugh's
driving is held by the team.
After driving the team
minibus to a recent fixture
in Reading it was
unanimously decided that
IC Hon. Sec. Quentin
'would you buy a used
transit from this man'
Fontana should take the
wheel on the return journey
for the benefit of all present
(including the minibus). Mr
Southey is not rumoured to
be thinking of a career
running his own coach
company.

Congratulations are in
order for RCS Hon. Sec.
Tom Melliar-Smith who has
recently been told that his
health has improved
sufficiently for him to enjoy
life to the full again (this
follows a serious head
injury he sustained during
the summer). It would seem
that Tom has taken full
advantage of his new
freedom for not only was
he heard wandering around
college last week claiming
he had been raped but on
Friday he was asked to take
part in a police identity
parade. Tom's friends
would like to say welcome
back and take it easy as
you've got another eighty
years at least.
And finally, a late news
item has just come in
regarding RCS Ents
Chairman and champion
degenerate Guy Perry. Mr
Perry is famed in RCS for
his ability to consume a
pint of human urine, which
he did to raise £10 for rag
earlier this term.
Unfortunately common
alcohol appears to have a
rather more serious effect
on Guy. I am informed he
has just spent a night in the
cells of the Metropolitan
police following his arrest
on the R C S carol singing'
evening somewhere in the
vicinity of Leicester Square.
The officers of the law were
kind enough not to bring
any charges, being content
to advise him to be more
careful what he drinks in
future.

Hapless DP, Dave
Kingston, really seems
incapable of making a fool
of himself. Several weeks
ago FELIX ran a story
entitled small is beautiful.
FELIX threatened to expose
Mr Kingston in all his glory
if he failed to make a
donation to Rag. We can
now reveal that Mr
Kingston was conned.
Unfortunately in the photo
Mr Kingston's private parts
are covered.
