PRESIDENT
How can I sum up why Carl should be President in
about 100 words
He has shown his ability, to take on any job and
do it excellently, as Rag Chairman and Rag Mag
Editor he has revrtabsed Rag and wifl do the same
for ICU as Prestdenf He has done a lot for IC,
edited the RCS Handbook, was one of the
founders ol IC Wing Chun Club, represented
I C U ai U L U and college committees and has
been the I C observer at the NUS conference
But havmg sax! thai he still exhibits the
charac terbtics of the average student

The job of President needs not only experience in

and Executive needs exact knowledge of the
students' case because the President will be facing
experienced negotiators A strong President who
will nol be intimidated by sue h people is needed 10
put forward the students' case
I believe lhat many students do not get involved
in the Union because there is a gross lack oi
communication between ihe Union and (he
geneial student body Consequently many
decisions are made by a small body self interested
parlies behind closed doors The excuse given is
thai if anybody wanted to find out. the information
is Ireety available I believe lhat students should be
told what is happening about all matters before key
derisions are made which affect them, in order for
iheir views to be heard

'Many decisions' wrote
Union President, Carl
Burgess in his election
publicity, 'are made by a
small body of self-
interested parties behind
closed doors. The excuse
given is that if anybody
wanted to find out, the
information is freely
available. I believe that
students should be told....in
order for their views to be
heard.' Carl was right to
» attack the way decisions
are made. Very few
students know or care
about what the Union does.
On Monday Council made
decisions that could affect
the clubs of which you're a
member, your residences
or your academic course.
FELIX attempts to tell you
about the decisions that
have been made, but you
really need to know about
the topics for discussion so
that you can influence the
decisions.
Carl has failed to carry
out his promise to make
decisions taken by the
Union more open. Many
Union officers, FELIX hacks
etc have found it extremely
difficult to keep in touch
with what Carl is doing.
They have been refused
documents about the Bar
takeover, for example. I
think Carl has made some
bad errors this term in his
dealings with College and I
am convinced that some of
them could have been
avoided if Carl had told
students what was going
on so that others could
have advised him.
Dave Kingston has also
tried to prevent students
finding out what be is
doing. He can be extremely
aggresive when people
question his actions. I
asked him a question a
week ago about the bar
takeover which he refused

to answer. I then rang Rob
Northey who gave me the
answer. It turned out that
Dave hadn't made the cock
up that I had feared.
Both Dave and Carl have
been heavily criticised this
term by Council and FELIX
so I can understand their
reluctance to answer
questions which may result
in them being criticised
again. They should realise,
though, that in the long
term ignoring students will
cause them more problems.
Rob Northey
Rob Northey has certainly
shaken up the refectories.
The Union Bar has lost two
popular members of staff
but Southside Bar has
gained an excellent new
refectory. The refectories
were in a terrible state
when Northey took them
over. Mr Mooney had run
them down. They needed
firm management and Mr
Northey has certainly
brought them under
control. Unfortunately, he
has also irritated a lot of
people in the process.
Perhaps people should
think about all the bad
Mooney meals they've had
before criticising Northey.
Don Ferguson
Student Services was in a
appalling mess when Don
Ferguson took over. Very
few students had any
confidence in the service
being provided. Don
appears to be a little less
arrogant with 'ordinary'
students than Michael
Arthur was. Unfortunately,
though, he is doing a
degree two days a week.
This means that he is a
