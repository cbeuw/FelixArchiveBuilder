Boring But True
IC Union has finalised
arrangements for the initial
takeover of the Union bar.
At the meeting of Bar
Committee last Wednesday
it was agreed that the
Union would assume
control of the bar on Friday
January 3 1986. Sabbatical
Officers Carl Burgess, Dave
Kingston and Quentin
Fontana presented the
details of the first stages of
the takeover to Monday's
meeting of council.
The date has been
chosen to coincide with
Refectory Manager Rob
Northey's monthly
stocktake. Once this has
been completed the
financial management and
day to day running of the
bar will become the Union's
responsibilites. A separate
account will be set up for
the bar and the initial float
will be funded by means of
a loan from the Union's
own account. ICU Deputy
President Dave Kingston
said that he expected this
sum to be of the order of a
few hundred pounds only.
He explained that most of
the stock would be sold
before it had to be paid for.
Money would not be
needed to pay for a large
quantity of stock at the
outset. Some of the bar
surplus will be fed back
into the Union's own
account by introducing
charges for management
and administration. Mr
Kingston and Mr Burgess
also intenu that profits from
the bar be set aside for
refurbishment of the
Lounge bar area and the
bar itself.
Until the Union has
obtained its own licence,
bar staff will be recruited in
consultation with Mr
Northey and Mr Iwen
Thomas, who will remain
the licencees. At
Wednesday's Bar
Committee Mr Northey
advised the Union Officers
to appoint a bonded
barman as manager.
Mr Kingston said on
Monday that the
Sabbaticals had been
looking out for a bar
manager for the last few
weeks, but that no
appointments could be
made until Council had
agreed to the detailed
proposals for the takeover.
Mr Northey told FELIX
last week that he would
expect that float for the bar
to be in the region of
Â£5000. He also commented
that the comparison of the
profitability of the Q M C
and IC bars, as reported in
FELIX on November 29,
had been highly misleading
since the QMC prices were
substantially higher.
The first joint paper by
Mr Burgess and College
Secretary John Smith was
not included on the agenda
for governing body on
Friday, following Mr
Burgess' request that ICU
Council should first
approve the document. The
paper had been passed at
the meeting of House
Committee on November 6,
but Council later instructed
Mr Burgess to ask that it be
temporarily withdrawn. Mr
Burgess and Mr Kingston
are hopeful that Council
will be able to agree any
amendments in time for the
paper to be re-submitted to
House Committee on
March 5.
Nearly 400 people, including Professor and Mrs Ash and
College Secretary John Smith, saw Dramsoc's production
of Alan Ayckbourn's 'Bedroom Farce' last week.

Faulty Finances
Hamlet Gardens residents
are complaining about a
mistake by Student
Services Finance Officer,
Dave Parry, that means that
they have recently received
additional bills for this
term. The students say that
they have not budgeted for
the extra rent.
Mr Parry forgot to bill the
residents for the Christmas
vacations, when he sent out
this term's bills at the start
of term. He also billed
some students living in
single rooms as though
they were living in doubles.
Mr Parry said that
Student Services would
wait for payment until the
students could afford it. He
criticised the students,
though, saying they should
have known how much
their rent was. He also
warned third year students
that their degrees would be
stopped if they didn't pay
by the end of the year.
Comfortable
Chemistry student Andrew
Healey was 'fairly
comfortable' in Charing
Cross Hospital on Monday,
two weeks afer he was
admitted with Thallium
poisoning. His condition is
understood to be improving
gradually, but he is still
unable to move or to talk
and has been breathing
with the aid of a ventilator.
Road Closed
Princes Gardens was
sealed off for over an hour
last Thursday after a
suspicious package was
reported outside No 3
Ennismore Gardens. Police
were alerted at around
7.45pm and immediately
closed the road to all traffic
and pedestrians. The
package, a brown suitcase,
was later discovered to
contain only rubbish.
Women's
Officer
Christine Taig was co-
opted by Council as
temporary Women's Officer
on Monday evening. This
follows the motion passed
at the U G M last week
calling for a change in the
bye-laws, to create such a
post. The change in the
bye-laws is likely to take
many months as it requires
a two-thirds majority at two
consecutive UGMs which
are not less than 28 and
not more than 40 days
apart.
Regalia
The Union Sports
Equipment and Regalia
Shop is now losing money,
with a drop in sales of 5%
from last year.
Internal Services
Chairman, Alan Rose, has
said that unless the
situation improves the shop
will have to close.
Hockey
IC men's hockey first
eleven were beaten 4-0 at
Harlington in the last
sixteen of the UAU
competiton. Club Captain
Jim Ward told FELIX that
the team didn't take its
chances. This is the
furthest IC have got in the
competition.
