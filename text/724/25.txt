Hockey
Ashford 0 IC 1sts 1
The first half saw IC
dominating the midfield
and excellent moves down
the right wing created
many chances. However
the attack, led by goal-shy
Justin 'Bullet' Brooking,
found the finishing touch
elusive. The defence played
superbly and achieved the
remarkable feat of
conceding no short
corners. Special mention to
Paul Smith's stopping
ability which stood out
from the rest of the
defence. In the second half
IC threw everything
forward desperately
seeking the winner. Even
Jon Stonham meandered
into the oppositions 'D'
before resisting the
temptation to shoot. In the
dying seconds, Ian Parker
showed a momentary flash
of brillance and scored a
blinder.
IC 2nds 0 Harrow Town 3
Things looked grim for the
Seconds when HTS turned
up having gained 13 points
from 15 in the league so
far. They looked much
worse when the opposition
managed to go one up in
the first 7 nanoseconds of
the game.
Not to be deterred by this
very early set-back the
Seconds promptly gave
away a penalty! However,
the gods of chance smiled
benignly down upon team
captain Phil Choudhury
who pulled off a somewhat
fortunate save. The ball
ricocheted off various parts
of his body in a vaguely
random order without
encroaching over the goal
line.
Throughout the game the
Seconds seemed to be at a
bit of a disadvantage in so
much as certain members
of the team found it very
difficult to stop the ball
This was in fact due to
certain gravitational
anomalies in the curvature
of space. These
phenomena were
particularly in evidence
around the region of space-
time occupied by Jim
Ward. It appeared that
whenever a Hockey ball
entered this zone at a fairly
pedestrian vel6city it
underwent an infinite
acceleration whilst its
volume shrunk to zero. This
was apparently the reason
why Jim found it almost
impossible to stop the ball.

IC got back to winning
ways beating LSE for the
third time in competitive
matches this season. With
conditions very slippery
underfoot it was always
going to prove hard for
defences with the LSE
keeper having a first half he
would want to forget. With
LSE reduced to 10 men
after a sickening clash of
heads (Lawrence Covill 3
stitches, LSE defender 6
stitches) IC began to make
their one man advantage
play, controlling the
midfield and playing one
touch football.
IC's first goal came when
the LSE Keeper was
deceived and wrong-footed
by Tom Dutton's 20 yard
drive. A second was added
when full back Chris
Engberg joined the attack,
again beating the LSE
keeper at the near post
from the edge of the box.
LSE's substitue finally
appeared at half time and
they came out a
rejuvenated side pulling
one back after 10 minutes.
IC regained their two goal
advantage almost
immediately with Tom
Dutton firing home from 18
yards for his second goal
of the game.
With 15 minutes
remaining a goal mouth
scramble following a corner
led to LSE again pegging
back the defeat to one
goal.
Water
Polo
After a high spirited trip to
Bristol, the Imperial
College water-polo squad
started their first round
tournament of the UAU
Championship poorly going
down 5-4 to Surrey
In the second game
against Southampton
University IC played to
their full potential putting
in four goals before half-
time. In the second half
several substitutions were
made with Johnston
replacing Eastman, Mayall
replacing Richardson and
Jackson and Crowther
going in in place of
Langman and Davis
respectively. The final
score in this confidence
boosting game was 11-2
which reflected Spooner's
wise decision to rest his
tired first seven players.
The crucial game of the
tournament for IC was
played against the other
favourite team, Bristol
University. Paul Richardson
gave away an early goal
but vindicated his place
with some solid defending
later in the first half. Strong
pressure from IC resulted
in a 7-3 win with goals from
Nigel Williams, Nick Ireland
and Eastman.
With this hard match out
of the way a win against
Bath University was
required to qualify as
leaders of the regional
group and this was
obtained with a 4-0 result.
Midway through the
season, the Cross-Country
club are maintaining a
slender lead over Surrey
University in the London
Colleges League. This is
thanks to a good turnout at
the last race at Shooters
Hill, where IC had enough
for 2 mens' teams and
(amazingly) a full ladies'
team. Bryan Gamblin ran
well to finish 9th and the
rare appearance of Paul
Brooks-Johnson and
'megastar' Mike James
ensured a solid first team
performance. Sue Waters
ran well again in the ladies
race, which also featured
the IC orienteering captain
getting lost!
At the Stag Hill relays, IC
came a very creditable 4th,
just failing to beat
University of London. In
the recent G L C
championships, the IC
Captain and bar race world
record holder, Jon Lea,
managed to get us
disqualified before the
start.
See the noticeboard for
next term's fixtures, which
include the Hyde Park
Relays and terminate (sic)
with the Holland trip.
Badminton
IC 10 Chelsea 1
Trying our best to ignore
the rain dripping on to the
side of the court, the mens
singles with Philip (Tan)
against the (legendary) JK
Wong (Chelsea) got under
way. This turned out to be
a very good game, indeed,
with superb badminton
from both sides, but with
HK Wong just managing to
win eventually 12-15, 15-3,
15-12.
Unfortunately for
Chelsea, their brilliant start
didn't last long. IC ladies
polished off their ladies
doubles to win all 3
rubbers. The men followed
suit winning all 3 men's
doubles, and the mixed
doubles were won by IC.
So, the final result was a
10-1 victory for IC, putting
them into the 2nd round of
the KO Cup, where they
will meet LSE on Saturday.
