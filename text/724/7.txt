LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR
FUTURE
You didn't choose your university without checking it
out carefully first, so why not come and talk to us about
that vitally important first step in your career and about
the advantages of taking it with Kodak.
We need electronics engineers, physicists,
chemists and bio scientists for research. We need comput-
ing, marketing and accountancy trainees. In return we
can offer an exciting working environment, plenty of
challenge, a chance to make your mark - and all the
benefits you'd expect from an international company
with a household name.
We'll be interviewing at your university on
February 17th, so check with your career service first,
pick up our leaflet - and let's talk about it.
See youthere!
