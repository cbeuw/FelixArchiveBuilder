IC dominated most of this
game on a very wet
Harlington pitch. West
London found it very
difficult to penetrate a well
co-ordinated IC defence,
whereas the IC defence
penetrated WL's with ease.
This lead to Jon Stoneface
scoring his annual goal, the
second half was much of
the same with Nick Hope
converting a much
deserved goal.
IC 3rds 0 Reading 3rds 3
An understrength IC team
went to Reading at 9am
and were beaten
comprehensively. Despite
this everyone enjoyed the
day. The only
performances of note were
those of Judith Hackney
and Mark Cottle who were
persuaded to turn up by an
extremely pissed captain
(despite not having played
hockey for several years) at
the previous evenings
FELIX dinner and played
with commitment.
QEC 4 IC Mixed 0
Fresh from our singing and
dancing (?) activities the
night before, the IC mixed
team were beaten by Q E C .
Their first goal was a
brilliant set-piece. Our
centre-back Chris Harrison
passed a beautiful ball to
Ann Jackson who slotted it
home nicely in her own net.
After that QEC scored 3
dubious goals; the only
consolation being that our
result looked good
compared with the 1sts.

Not a lot to say except they
were very, very good
(Southern Premier League)
and we weren't. Result was
Paul Smith (3 penalty flicks
against), J Stonehenge (1
against) and goal keeper
Chris Jones (1 missed).
Rugby
Hooray! I'm sure that word
says it all for all you Virgins
out there. Yes—we've
finally lost our virginity and
we won a match—infact,
we've won two! This epic
event occured on Sunday,
December the 8 when we
played in a mini-
tournamant in Cobham.
Our first match of the
day was against Surrey,
who we creamed, 12-0. It
was a proud moment for
Vicki (Foghorn) Williams
who scored her first try
ever. Jackie (Shorty) Peirce
also scored a try, as did
Kate the Nurse (a visiting
player).
Our second match was
more competitive, but the
ball was in our possession
most of the time and the
only try of the match was
scored again by our dear
Foghorn (with the help of
about 5 nameless others,
Thanks to all the people who have written sports reports
this term. Hope you have a happy Christmas. Don't get too
pissed
Richard Ellis, Sports Editor
who helped push it over the
try line). St Georges came
very close to a try in the
opening moments of the
match, but one of our
clever lasses touched it
down, thus saving the day.
The tournament (which,
incidentally, we won), was
topped off by a
communal bath, into
which Captain Anne made
a dramatic entrance. We
were most entertained by a
rousing version of
'Paradise by the
Dashboard Light' sung to
us by Sue, Annette, and
Dina, and also by darling
Sue losing her soap (we
don't know where).
Anyway—Merry Xmas
virgins, and a sordid new
Year! See ya in a couple of
weeks.
Badminton
IC Ladies 5 Bristol 4
the closest game the IC
Ladies have played so far,
with the 2nd pair having an
extremely tense game
against Bristol 3rd pair,
which they eventually won
15-8, 7-15, 15-12. Thanks tc
Robin Martin, Sarah
Threadgold, Sarah Yates
(Captain), Helen Gregory,
Anne Pedley and Julie
Hutt.
RSM 4 RFH 1
RSM go marching on!
Imperial College's top
football team extended
their unbeaten run to
thirteen games (ten wins
and three draws) from the
start of the season. To kick
off the fortnight we got a
valuable point away to 2nd
placed Guy's, Amin Jafar
grabbing the goal, then
drawing 1-1 with LSE in the
quarter final of the ULU
cup, Pete Seddars scoring
and the game being
abandoned in extra time. It
was a magnificent
performance by RSM
against some rather
dubious tactics and we
would surely have won had
it not gone dark. Any
chance of ICU providing
floodlights at Harlington?
Any road, we stayed top of
the table as we won our
last game before
Christmas, 4-1 against
RFH; our goals came from
Amin Jafar, Big Head
Brook, Chopper Wardle
and an own goal, and only
a ridiculous penalty
awarded by fat stupid
G. .ran beat Andy Hands.
Many thanks to all the
team—don't come back too
fat after Christmas and
we'll win the League and
Cup.
Squad: Andy Hands,
Oyster Olsen, Tim
Hardwick, Chopper Wardle,
Keith McScotty, Bob, Ged
McTurk, Brook, Curly
Woodward, Steve Riding,
Chris O'Brian, W O Wen,
Amin the Pak, Pete 'Bullet'
Seddars and Byran the
Tree.
All you 2nd team lads
keep turning up as well,
we'll try and get a few
games for you next term.

Imperial College's new
Cave Canoe Football
Society begins its trials
next week. As many of you
will know this popular
Welsh sport played by two
teams of canoeists in a
cave using a leather
football and various caving
gear (lights etc). Will

event please contact either
