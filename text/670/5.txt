Travelling Light
The Government has announced
how it intends to revise the
arrangements for refunding
students with their travel
expenses. At present students can
claim back on a 'pound for

daily travel into College and for
the journeys to and from their

only a restricted choice of where
to study.

been rejected by the Scottish
Education Department because
of the severe hardship they would
cause. Ministers themselves
admit that they will involve
'rough justice' for students. A
relatively small amount of money
would be saved if they were
introduced in England and
Wales, yet many students would
lose out badly in financial terms.
