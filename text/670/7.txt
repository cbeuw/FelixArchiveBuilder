Galileo was right!
Reviews
Three hundred and forty-two
years after his death, the sub-
ject of Dramsoc's production is
in the news again. "Galileo's
so called heresy does not seem
(o have any theological or
canonical basis" admits an
inquiry by the Vatican after
three years study. Galileo was
condemned in 1616 and again
in 1633.
The play 'Galileo' is by
Bertolt Brecht, author of
'Baal', a recent T V prod-
uction starred David Bowie
and the 'Caucasian Chalk
Circle'. It telL the story of
Galileo and his struggle to get
his ideas accepted by the
Church authorities. L i k e
G a l i l e o , B r e c h t was no
stranger to c o n t r o v e r s y ,
fleeing Germany in 1933 when
Hitler came to power. Even
the translator from the
original German, Howard
Brenton, was threatened
with prosecution by Mary
Whitehouse for his own play
'The Romans in Britain'.
"It shows how difficult it is
to get new ideas accepted,"

Galileo
The play begins in 1610
when Galileo is working in
Venice a n d presents his
development of the telescope
to the Doge. Already known
for his works on falling bodies
and mechanics, he uses his
telescope to examine the
heavens and finds proof for
the theories of Copernicus.
The Church authorities had
previously based their teach-
ing on Aristotle and the
P t o l e m a i c system o f the
universe, which agreed with
the Bible and placed the Earth
at the centre of the universe.

Galileo's teaching and his
position as champion of the
new theories attracts the
attention of the Church and
his work is suppressed.
In his 'Dialogue on the two
Chief World Systems', the
Ptolemaic Copernican, he
tried to prove that Copernicus
was right and used a character
called Simp/icio, a simpleton,
to put the Ptolemaic view. The
Pope, Urban VIII recognised
the arguments as ones he had
personally put to Galileo, and
the inquisition took its cue.
Galileo was condemned and
spent the rest of his life under
house arrest.
The story also contains
hope and heroism. " T h e
blood runs cold with fear
when one thinks o f the
courage men and women find
to carry truths over borders in
our day", writes the trans-
lator. G a l i l e o ' s realistic
attitude is as relevant today as
when witches were burnt in
the seventeenth century.
M O N K : Won't the truth, if
it is the truth, prevail with or
without us?
G A L I L E O : No, no, no. As
much of the truth will prevail
that we make prevail.
