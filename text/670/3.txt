CCUs Make Waves
The RCS and Guilds College fought a close battle in the
Swimming Gala last Thursday with Guilds just getting the
edge in the relay events. The final result was Guilds 136
points, RCS 109 and Mines 67. Mines Union, however,
completely dominated the water-polo event, easily beating
both the other CCUs.
Rag Week Flop
Last Wednesday, Paul Cronk, a
Sabbatical Officer of University
College Union, was kidnapped
by m e m b e r s o f the R o y a l
College of Science as a stunt for
the m i n i - R a g Week. After
several hours of negotiation,
during which they convinced
U C L U n i o n that L S E h a d
kidnapped him as part of the
hunt for Bruce the Beaver, he
was released in exchange for a
case of Fosters and £5.
This stunt was the only high
spot in an otherwise disapp-
ointing Rag Week. Tuesday's
S i l l y Sports event was not
successful, raising only £10, and
the Hypnosis Lecture scheduled
for Tuesday evening had to be
p o s t p o n e d o w i n g t o t h e
hypnotist, M a r t i n S T a y l o r ,
falling ill. It is hoped that the
street collections held tonight
and tomorrow morning will be
more of a success. The Royal
C o l l e g e o f Science w i l l be
collecting outside Harrods at
5.30pm today and will be leap-
frogging down Kensington High
Street tommorow morning. C'.ty
and G u i l d s College will be
having a Pyjama Rag outside
Harrods on Saturday morning.
Those wishing to take part
should turn up to their C C U
Offices at 10.00am.
UGM Sketch
I C U had a brainstorm at
yesterday's Union General
Meeting and passed several
'trendy left-wing' motions with a
minimum of fuss after refusing to
hear them for months. However,
despite all these near-miracles the
meeting stopped just short of
voting for the second coming -
Michael Newman will not be next
year's External Affairs Officer.
Michael was not present for the
start of the election but briefly
flustered in during Jo Claydon's,
his opponent's speech. Miss
Claydon's speech was 'unevent-
ful' and even prompted J. Martin
Taylor, F E L I X News Editor and
FELIX H n H M H
widely believed to be the most
boring speaker in the history of
this college, to utter T was never
as boring as that'.
Total lunancy then prevailed -
usually revolving round Mines
V P T i m Williams who made
several speeches - usually totally
irrelevant - and always carrying a
package the size of a video tape,
probably something porno-
graphic about animals and
coloured people down South
African Mines. M r Williams'
major success however was in
c o m m e n d i n g a m o t i o n ,
subsequently passed, that
Gaynor Lewis should write to
Ronald Reagan ordering him to
name one cruise missile Imperial
College Union.

Aussies Move in
A new travel agency is to begin
trading at IC at the beginning of
next term. They are Student
Travel of Australia (STA) and
will operate under the name
ULU Travel at IC.
STA, who are presently based
on the Old Brompton Road, will
build an office at IC during the
Easter vacation. The old corner
bar in the J C R will be adapted
for this purpose at a cost of
around £5000. S T A will pay for
the conversion themselves. The
building plans are at present
awaiting approval by Estates
expert, M r Hector Cameron
Clark.
The contract with S T A is still
under consideration, but it seems
that it will be of considerable
benefit to IC Union. They will
receive 1% of all takings with a
guaranteed minimum income of
£2500 per annum.
STA will probably be here for
a minimum of five years, but
they could be given a year's
notice to quit before that time, if
necessary. They already operate
successfully at U L U and Queen
Mary's College and negotiations
are under way with Royal
Holloway.
The new travel agency
replaces London Student Travel,
who left IC during the summer
after a storm of protests from
students about poor service. One
student successfully sued L S T
for selling him an over-priced
ticket.
The redundant bar in the J C R
will be little missed. It was
chiefly used for 'after-hours*
bars using cloakroom tickets, a
practice that was discontinued
after warnings from the police.
