Editorial
Last week has been one of the most
successful ever for IC sports clubs. As
reported in this week's hallowed pages, Water
Polo have won the U A U Championships.
Hang-Gliding have also won the U A U
Championships. There will be a full report
next week, but seeing as thay've done so well,
I'll print the team list, against my moral
principle:—
Dave Rusby
Dave Evans
Karl Briers
Mel Barton
Dave Thomas
Pete Edwards
The Volleyball Club have also won their
U A U Championship, though I haven't got
any details as they couldn't be bothered to
submit a report.
Congratulations to all these teams and all
the others who will win (or else!) in the next
few weeks.

Basketball
Imperial 164 London Hospital 56
There is a basketball expression, American of
course, called going for a Bill. (A Bill being a
dollar being 100 cents bieng equivalent to 100
points—see?) IC went for a Bill. They banked
a Bill fifty and got compound interest. L H got
the change out of two Bills.
In a close, tense match both teams
employed fast break tactics except IC tended
to score and L H tended to miss.
Finito Benito.
Hi scores were Walter 'the Dude' Morgan
46; Alex 'Suger Hog' Mackenzie 44; 'Sweet'
Ken Jarret 25; Homan ' H ' Haghighi 24.
Special mention to Captain Tim 'the grin'
Vink for excellent defence.
I rest my case j?ld boy!
Team 1 continued in the same vein by losing
again, but against a good team this week.
However they are so confident that they have
won tonight's (Monday 5) game 7-2.
Conformation of the fact next week.
Team 3, with John playing for the first time
for ages, pulled off a classic victory against
Gainsford IV. The only problem is that they
now face Gainsford III and Etessa II in the
next few eeks, who are both in a position to
pip us for the Division 4 title—should be fun!
Team 4 pulled off another magnificent feat
of improbability by winning again, 6-3
against London Hospital who are well placed
in Division 5. Well done lads, especially
Kevin McKoen who surpassed all previous
performances.
Team 5 in the words of their Captain
'cruised to a 6-3 victory against Trinity House
Youth Club'. Congratulations to Shing Hing
Man for winning all his after a particularly
unlucky run.
Judo
k
Last Sunday, the cream of IC Judo Club went
to a grading at the London Judo Society, in
Stockwell. In a good display of Judo,
everybody won constants and so increased
their grades. Sarah Parker and Paul Mellor,
at their first grading, did very well, and both
got organge belts. Andy Binding and Graham
West turned their green belts into blue ones.
Ian Nevitt changed his junior blue into a
senior blue. Gabby Sheilds got her brown,
and Tim Stockings (nee Binding) got his top
brown.
A reminder that today is the inter-colleges
competition and we meet at 4:45pm in Beit
Quad. Reserves are likey to be needed. If
there are any 15 stone plus neolythic men (or
women) types wanting instant fame and
stardom they should turn up as well.
Finally, congratulations to Mark Smith
who got his black belt at the end of February.

Orienteering
Last Sunday the Orienteering Club travelled
to Five-Hundred-Acre Wood in Ashdown
Forest, home of Christopher Robin and his
friends.
The event was the venue for the delayed
London-Cambridge match, in which IC
runners helped to reach a close result—we're
not sure who won! The contest saw valient
performances, as many in the club 'ran up' a
class to count in the match. Of particular note
was Andy Shoreman who coped well to reach
Gold standard; and Les who wins the Eeyore
award for being out an awful long time!
Captain Coke limped around valiantly on his
gammy leg—still beating some of us who
winnied around a bit and had a Poohr runs.
On looking back over my (bloodstained!)
map it occurs to me that Winnie and his
chums must have been tough little critters to
romp around in such a rough'n'tough'n'
mean'n'greeen areaf
Punchdrunk
IC 959 Kings 957 (Away)
In a nail-biting return match against Kings,
IC demonstrated their superior match
capability by winning with a two point lead
out of a possible 1,000 points. Both team
captains showed how easy it is to make
complete fools of themselves by failing to
break 190 ex 200. Matthew Guille of Kings
got the highest score of the day with 199—a
rather disappointing score for him (he won a
silver medal at the last Commonwealth
Games for 3 positional rifle). Gareth Jones
and Tom Gigs both shot 195 for IC. One of
Tom's cards was possibly the most dubious
ton ever shot!

Steve Harrison showed his class in the
prone rifle handicap cofhpetition by beating
Andrew Hamilton, thus taking frist place
(nett scores were 198 against 197). When
Steve gets his new high scoring weapon (an
Anschutz Supermatch) he should be unassail-
able. We look forward to seeing his increased
scoring rate which has been flagging recently.
This Sunday we are going down to Bisley
for the inter-CCU practice full-bore rifle day,
with the actual match in a week's time. If you
are unsure of travel arrangements, please
come down at lunch time today to check the
notices.
Important dates for all ICRPC members:
on Wednesday 14 election papers come
down, elections barnite starts at 6:30 in Stan's
followed by the club dinner at Chompers. The
club A G M will be on Thursday 15, so if you
have any bright ideas how IC's top sporting
club should be run please come along to the
range at 1:00pm.
