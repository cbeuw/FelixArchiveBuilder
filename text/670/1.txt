fSP 1 OF COLLEGE U
Cruise On!
The results of the Sabbatical Elections were oficially announced at the
Results UGM yesterday. The full results appear on page 3. Also at the
meeting elections for non-sabbatical Union Officers were held
following which no less than five motions were passed. Union President
Gaynor Lewis was mandated to write to Ronald Reagan to request that
a cruise missile be named 'Imperial College Union'.
The election results were as
reported in the special F E L I X
news sheet on Wednesday. Ian
Bull, Dave Parry, Eric Darby-
shire and Dave Rowe were
elected President, D P , Hon Sec
and F E L I X Editor respectively.
O f the e l e c t i o n s h e l d at
yesterday's U G M only that for
External Affairs Officer was
contested, with Jo Claybrain
(Shome mishtake shurely - Ed)
beating Michael Newman for the
post. Other Officers for next
year will be Graham Thorpe
( A c a d e m i c A f f a i r s ) , James
Benbow (Rag Chairman), Dave
Allen (Ents Officer), J Martin
Taylor (Internal Services) and
Mike Stuart (Welfare). The post
of Community Action Group
Chairman remains vacant. Sean
Davis was elected unopposed as
U G M Chairman.
The meeting then moved on to
motions. A motion proposed by
Simon Neild that observers be
sent to the next NUS conference
was passed. Papers for two
observers, to be elected by
Council, will go up on Monday.
Next on the agenda was a
motion on Grenada and the
Lebanon but the meeting voted
not to hear this. Then the
motion on Cruise missiles was
heard. The motion called for
protest by the U n i o n about
C r u i s e b e i n g s t a t i o n e d i n
B r i t a i n , but an amendment
proposed by T i m W i l l i a m s ,
R S M U VP, which instructed the
Union President to write to
Ronald Reagan asking for a
missile to be named after I C U
was carried overwhelmingly, as
was the amended motion.
Two serious motions, one
opposing the abolition of the
ILEA and the other calling for
collections to be held for the
W o r l d U n i v e r s i t y S e r v i c e
scholarship fund, were then
passed with little opposition.
Michael Newman's motion on
Pimps was then considered but
received no votes at all. Finally
an emergency motion that all
present be bought a pint in the
Queen's Arms by the present
sabbaticals was passed with only
three votes against.

The consequences of further cutbacl s in Government funding would be
disasterous for Imperial College, according to the Pro-Rector.
Speaking at an open meeting called to discuss the College's response to
the recent University Grants Committee questionaire on the future of
higher education, Professor Alan Swanson said that the result jof
assumptions required by the questions would be that the College would
have to close 'a medium-sized department'. He severely criticised the
Union for its poor and unconstructive reply to the questionaire, twice
stating that there had been 'very little response' from the Union despite
his invitation to all interested bodies in College to contribute.
The meeting was called so that running through the College's
EAO Peter Burt and Pro-Rector Professor Swanson
No 670 WmmWMMWKBWWBUWUWMKWmWMWMM
the Pro-Rector, who is co-
ordinating IC's response, could
explain its main points to
interested members of College.
The U G C has asked 28 quest-
ions, to all of which College is
replying. The first three quest-
ions are, however, the most
fundamental.
Question number one asks for
the College's plans if over the
next five years there is constant
funding with student numbers
remaining static. The second
question supposes a cut in
resources with constant student
numbers, and the third asks for
plans for the subsequent five
years (1990-95) if student
numbers decline by about 15^>
as suggested by demographic
trends.
The College would face
difficulties even in the first of
these scenarios, said Professor
Swanson. Already maintenance
of buildings has been cut back to
extremely low levels and this
could soon result in serious
problems. Staff cuts by early
retirement have left many
departments with no scheduled
retirements for up to four years.
The situation if there were to be
further cuts following those over
the last five years would be such
that the College would have to
close a 'medium-sized depart-
ment' according to Professor
Swanson. He hoped sanity
would prevail and that the
Government would not seek to
impose such damage on Imperial
College.
One of the main themes
response is the need to give
priority to technological subjects
at the expense, if necessary, of
less vocational subjects. Whilst
the College believes there should
be academic activity concerned
with 'everything which human
beings have thought about',
useful or not, it is concerned
with producing trained scientists
and engineers upon whom the
nation's economic health dep-
ends.
In repyling to a question
from a student in the audience
who asked if the College would
include in its response the view
that students would be dis-
c o u r a g e d f r o m g o i n g to
University if the value of the
student grant was further
reduced. Professor Swanson said
he felt that it was up to the
Union to push forward such
contributions. The Union has, in
his opinion, failed to respond
adequately to the questionnaire,
giving excuses about being busy
with other matters.
It was reported in FELIX
issue 663 that the Union's
response to the questionnaire
would not be taken seriously by
College because it was badly
written and wishy-washy. It
seems that this assessment of the
Union response is shared by the
Pro-Rector. Union President
Gaynor Lewis, one of the
authors of the Union response,
was reported after the meeting
to be 'hopping mad' about the
Pro-Rector's comments.
