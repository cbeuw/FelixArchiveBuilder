It was shortly after dawn, o n a cold,
windy morning in Cheapskate. A few
citizens were making their dreary, daily
trudge up Baronsgate. A n d as the
cleaners cleaned away the tattered
posters which were strewn all over the
k i n g d o m , J o h n S e c r e t a r y sat in
h i s o f f i c e , d e e p w i t h i n t h e
bowels of the Surefield building. U p o n
his desk lay a thick document, bound in
leather. It was the latest of his cunning
schemes, designed to bring absolute
control of the citizens hovels to him
alone. 'Within months, the rents will be
so high that all the citizens will have left.
Then I can fill them with stupid A m e r i c a n
tourists,' he mused. 'All I need is a weak
President '
M u c h later that day, secure in the
anonymity of a dark, romantic corner in
Southside tavern sat the subject of J o h n
Secretary's machinations: Gormless
Layon. A n d at her side, as ever, was
'next year's president' Ian Balls. G o r m -
less gazed longingly into his eyes, pouted
her lips a n d whispered, suggestively,
into his ear: ' O o h , you're s o able a n d
experienced, Ian. It's enough to sweep a
simple girl like me off her feet.'
Always most amenable to flattery,
Balls nodded sagely and took a further
sip of his mead. For he had achieved the
ultimate confidence trick: he believed his
own publicity!
Already his thoughts were moving to
more ambitious projects.
'The problem is that a year is such
short time,' he m o a n e d to the ever
attentive Gormless. 'What is needed is
c o n t i n u i t y — y e a r s , d e c a d e s of u n -
i n t e r r u p t e d r u l e . ' T u r n i n g t o f a c e
Gormless, Balls prepared to reveal his
wildest dreams. M u s t e r i n g the most
statesman-like voice that his grating
n o r t h e r n t o n e s c o u l d m u s t e r , h e
declared ' Y o u and I Gormless—toge-
ther we c a n form a dynasty to last a
t h o u s a n d y e a r s . N o m o r e s o r d i d
elections, no evil F A L I X Editors to cope
with. A life of perpetual luxury—sherry,
pate and unfettered power. For just the
two of us, Gormless.'
' O h , and Pristine,' replied Gormless,
wisely realising that someone would
have to d o the work. B u t G o r m l e s s '
response fell o n deaf ears for Balls was
lost in a flight of fantasy, his imagination
already h a d h i m , wreathed in laurels
sitting majestically in front of chanting
citizens.
However, Balls flight of fantasy came
to a sudden end. F o r a tall shadow fell
upon both Balls a n d Gormless. Their
hearts filled with fear and trepidation as a
tall man, donned in a long black coat and
carrying an old canvas bag at his side,
approached. A n d their worst fears were
realised—'Ere, will you sign this petition
I've got Gormless?'
Y e s , it was Peter B u r p the citizen's
representative whose job it was to plead
with the Baron's seniors for a few more
groats. N o o n e w a s safe from the
clipboard and pen. A s Balls turned away
Gormless resisted the easy way out ' O h
can't I sign it later Peter? I was having a
break from my affairs of state.'
T h e astute Peter B u r p noted the
grandeur of G o r m l e s s ' reply a n d
guessed that Balls' influence had begun
to show. Shrewd as ever, Burp pressed
home his request in a way sure to get'
results.
' O h , please sign now Gormless—Pris-
tine has!' Gormless hurriedly placed an
' X ' ot the bottom of the page and a now
smiling B u r p shuffled off o n his way.
Gormless a n d Balls were left in their
romantic solitude.
What do Gormless and Ian get
up to in their romantic solitude?-
Find out in the next exciting
instalment of The Baron of Cheap-
skate.

M r J F D Lauwerys, Senior Assistant
Secretary
Some people who are featured in this
column are relatively uriKnown to the
vast majority of students at Imperial
College yet are important within the
College. However, J o h n Lauwerys has
been in the public eye for some time yet
is a minor cog (infact rather a rusty cog)
in the I C machine. H e has a profile
without substance as the report he
prepared rather cruelly pointed out.
O n e could almost say that his report was
that of a n automiton manipulated from
elsewhere o n level 5. Few people w h o
quote the report have taken the trouble
to read it a n d to discover that it is
unimaginative and badly argued. It gains
a credibility by quotation that it does not
deserve.
It is pertinant to remember that the
points at issue now are those devised by
J o h n Smith justified by the invocation of
report. A report that was poorly
prepared and published several months
late was less widely discussed than it
should have been. It generated a n
acrimony that has obscured the very
real and important problems that face
the College.
Since the report J o h n Lauwerys has
been attached to the estates section. It is
difficult to decide who is being rewarded
or punished by such a move. It is difficult
not to have some sympathy for the man
now that his life is pure tedium
interrupted only by anticlimax. It is
reminiscent of the life led by the ex-Kings
and royal pretenders who clutter up the
Sherfield building in some hope of the
return to the life of grandeur led by their
ancestors yet and of grandeur led by
their ancestors yet are desinted-to be
trumped by filing clerks for the rest of
their lives.
In a previous article D o n Clark and
Hector C a m e r o n - C l a r k were termed
'Laurel a n d Hardy'. Perhaps with the
addition of J o h n Lauwery we are
witnessing the debut of 'the Three
Stooges'.
