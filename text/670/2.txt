Dear Pallab
I hope you will prove your
editorial integrity by printing
this.
Here are a few words about
my recent involvement in the
election for F E L I X Editor,
which I feel are in order at this
time. I still believe I did not
infringe the Union publicity
rules in any clearly obvious
way. Further, I believe the
vigour with which some people
in this College regard rules and
constitutions as sacred in some
way, as a general malaise which
affects the whole structure of
ICU. It seems as if, in too many
situations, doing things as
conventions says or as they
have always been done, is
regarded as a sure fire formula
for success. IC has a tradi-
tionally moderate union, but
too often these days this
appears to translate as bureau-
cratic, pompous and apathetic,
such an attitude will not be of
much use in preventing College
doing drastic things to rents.
I should point out before I go
any further that at no time was I
consulted by the elections com-
mittee, in any way, about the
article in Guildsheet I am held
responsible for, and in which
my principle involvement was
the typing. M y only crime as far
as I can see is that I did not go
out of my way to prevent its
publication. I suggestion that
the election committee may
have been less correct than they
believed, as a result of their
enthusiasm.
As far as certain letters of
appeal are concerned I wish to
make it clear that they were
forged. I had intended until the
day of the U G M not to appeal
further in order not to extend
already overlong proceedings.
I would also like to make a
few points about my object in
standing as a candidate. I did
not particularly want to be
F E L I X Editor. I chose the post
to be a joke candidate far as
there were already too many for
the presidency. This all arose as '
a result of a number of people
expressing the following views.
First and most obvious that
most of what is presented to the
'average student' is a load of
total rhetoric and bears the
same relationship to the truth as
page three of the Sun does to
investigative j o u r n a l i s m .
Second, that no one should be I
L e t l e r ^ - t o ^ e - J E d i t o r
I3J
under any sort of illusion about
the type of person standing. The
truth is that people like Aidon
Jennery are probably more
realistic about themselves than
the likes of messrs Bull and
Simion. The College adminis-
trators are professionals at their
jobs (catering excluded of
course) and it will require more
than experience of sitting on
hack committees to influence
them greatly on matters such as
residence and control of Union
bars. Remember if John Smith
makes a concession the first
reaction should be to question
his motive rather than claim a
victory.
Having said all this I parti-
cularly wish Dave Parry luck
with his stated intentions and
cannot stress too strongly that
everyone should try to get
involved on these matters.
Lastly I would like to make
clear that none of the comments
which I personally am respon-
sible, should be regarded as a
criticism of what you have
tried to make of F E L I X . We
have seen promises made for
next year, and it will be
interesting to see how practical
reality compares. Certainly
anybody wishing to make the
sort of attacks, which have been
levelled against F E L I X should
be very sure they could do
better. This said I am appalled
at last week's letters page, and
in particular the fact that you
chose to print a religious advert
as a space filler, while stating in
the manifesto section that I did
not submit any material. This is
not quite true as I placed a short
letter stating my position into
the copy tray while it was not
more than three feet from your
face, I will admit however that it
was four minutes after the copy
deadline (most important if
things are to be correct to the
letter). Nevertheless I was de-
nied any voice at all and you did
not do yourself justice. I wish,
to repeat here one point from
•that letter, that the section of
Paul Simion's manifesto attri-
buted to me, was not in any way
my work (I seem to have a big
probem with this sort of thing).
I hope those people who

regarded me as a mental retard
will see their way clear to give
me a chance to revive my
credibility.
Yous sincerely

(After such a profound and well
written letter Mark I cant imag-

Dear Pallab
With regard to the sabbatical
elections, not yet knowing the
results of course, could the
elections committee -ask Ian
Bull if he obtained copyright
from Schulz; and if not has he
broke the election rules?

Physics 3
Nose
Nonsense
Dear Ed
Just the other day I remarked
to quite a close associate
that I had been blowing my
nose on frequent occasions
recently. They replied that they
didn't tell me every time they
blew theirs! Well! This led me to
ponder the subject of social
intercourse with in depth
analysis on bogey subjects of
our time and culture(s).
I reasoned that my colleague
must surely have been
embarrassed by the stinging
honesty of the remark, and,
unused to such an open attitude
became slightly offensive,
which was obviously a reaction
they could not help and, which I
sympathise and understand.
My point is that we should all
try to embrace each others
quirks a bit more and not limit
ourselves to just certain parts of
the body. Remember, noses fit
into things too. Now, if you'll
excuse me I'll have to blow—
Aaaachoooo

Bible
Vindicated
Dear Pallab
I was very interested to read
in your last issue M r T Sheriffs
letter concerning the existence
of God. On this point M r
Sheriff and I are totally in
agreement. However, I would
like to clear up a misunder-
standing. In his letter he asserts
that the Old Testament and the
Gospel are not intact in their
original form. In the British
museum there are manuscripts
of the Gospels that date from a
time only shortly after the Life
of Christ. These are the manu-
scripts used in translating the
English Bible. It is interesting to
note that there are about 100
manuscripts of the N e w
Testament, whereas undisputed
Greek poetry such as Homer's
Iliad have very few reliable
manuscripts.
Also, when the dead sea
'scrolls were discovered it was
found that they corresponded
almost exactly to later manu-
scripts, and if such a standard is
maintained then the O l d
Testament is trustworthy. (The
Dead Sea Scrolls predate
Christ.)
Perhaps M r Sheriff would be
interested in attending his de-
partmental Bible study, where
he would be welcome to discuss
these things in greater length.
Yours sincerely

Dear Pallab
I'm writing to thank F E L I X
for dispelling the misappre-
hension I'd been under for the
last nineteen years that my
name was Simon Redlich
I was relieved to discover at
last that my name is in fact
'Paul Richardson, as reported in
last week's F E L I X under the
picture of the new RCS Exec.
My only remaining fear is
that perhaps my name is Simon
Redlich but I have a long lost
identical twin called Paul
Richardson walking around
College who is to be RCS H J T
next year in place of myself.
Could your team of ace
investigative reporters resolve
this quandary for me?
Yours
