Feature
Cuts: The Crisis Continues
IC Under Attack
Imperial College has recently
been informed by the University
Grants Committee (UGC) of its
recurrent grant for the 1984/5
session.
The College is to receive
£ 2 8 . 0 6 m f r o m the U G C ,
compared with £27.29m for this
year. However, in real terms this
represents a cut of 2'/2 %
(assuming Retail Price inflation
of 5.5%), despite Government
promises of level funding over
this period.
What will this mean for students?
In the words of one department's
Director of Undergraduate
Studies, 'if we have a cut of 2'/2 %,
the effect on the teaching budget
will be 10%, as the salaries bill for
the College must firstly be paid.
This will affect the quality of
courses.' Departments will be
unable to take any initiative in
modernizing courses. There is no
money to spend on new
equipment; students will be
unfamiliar with new techniques
and applications. A l l other things
being equal, IC students will be
less attractive to an employer
than you would have been had
you graduated three years earlier, j
Since departments are having
to fight for money for academic
purposes, there will certainly be
nothing to spend on subsidising
C o l l e g e services such as
refectories, and, as we have
recently seen, residences. This
will lead to even more price
increases with the effect of
squeezing your grant still further.
• Libraries and Welfare Services,
both important to students, are
also 'soft targets' for College to
constrict when saving money.
' Things look bad for students.
The prospects are even worse for
others when we consider the
effect of jobs losses.
The Government Looks to the
Future
The recently published Public
Expenditure White Paper gives a
few hints as to how the Education
sector can expect to fare over the
next couple of years. Education
as a whole will receive a cut in
provision unless inflation and
wage increases are held at levels
generally considered to be
o p t i m i s t i c a l l y l o w . T h e
Universities are told that 'the
cash available will require a
measure of increased economy if
standards are to be maintained'.
This is because a half per cent
'efficiency cut' is to be made in
their funding.
Page 4 ^BMUUMMMMUWSSBGBk
Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer,
chairman of the U G C , has
confirmed that the Universities
can expect 'nibbling away' of
their resources over the next few
years.
Efficiency cuts sound laudable
in principle, but in practise many
feel that efficiency within the
Universities will not be improved
by the understaffing which
usually results from such cuts. At
a time when demand for higher
education is rising and inflation
and wages are beginning to creep
up, it seems that inefficiency is
not all that will be cut.
Colleges Looks to the Future
Imperial College has by now
drafted a document, yet to be
ultimately approved by the
Governing Body, in response to
the U G C ' s '28 questions'
consultation. The report explains
how the College intends to adopt
to the changing forces in Higher
Education into the 1990s, and is
clearly of major importance in
subsequent planning.
The response paints a grim
picture for the future even if level
funding is granted. It states that
'if the present depressed level is
maintained for both recurrent
and equipment funding, new
initiatives in teaching and
research will be very severely
restricted, the quality of both will
suffer, and opportunities to do
research which would be valuable
to the community will be turned
down, because the College will
not be able to provide the
necessary facilities.' We are also
told that 'no major expansion of
activity would be possible, and
the resources for even small
initiatives would have to be
found by contracting other
activities'.
The consequences of further
cuts would be disastrous,
requiring abandonment of all
academic initiatives, reductions

Dear
As a student at Imperial College, London, I note with
great disappointment the recent Department of Education
and Science (DES) proposals concerning Student Awards
for the 1984/5 session.
The DES plan an increase in the student once again face
a cut in their real income. Increases in the parental
contribution and halving of the minimum grant means that
students will be even more dependent upon the goodwill of
their parents. Plans to reform the present system of travel
payments will undoubtedly place students who live some
distance from their college at a severe disadvantage if
implemented.
The wider issue of cutbacks to Higher Education as a
whole is of major concern to me. Local Authority Higher
Education is facing drastic pruning this year and the
Univerrsities have been asked how they would react to a
further drop in their resources. Imperial College itself, an
internationally respected college of science and technology,
faces a 2y2% cut in funding over the next academic year in
real terms. Whilst I am aware that the government is
committed to reducing public expenditure, I would point
out the importance of skilled graduates as an investment
towards the long term wellbein of the country.
I would be very grateful if you would reply to me outlining
your opii is on these matters. If you share the concern of
students I should be grateful if you would raise the issue as
a Parliamentary question, or directly with Mr Peter Brooke,
Under-Secretary of State at the DES and by calling for a full
Parliamentary debate on the education cuts in general.
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Yours sincerely

in academic staff and, in extreme
cases w o u l d leave some
departments unmanageable and
some buildings unsafe. The
report comments that 'it is a
matter of considerable regret that
the 'great debate' is being
conducted under the shadow of a
suggestion of less than the level
funding which the universities
had been led to expect from 1984-
5 following the period of
contraction. The damage to the
universities caused by the general
trend of government policy could
be incalculable'.
On the whole, the draft report
makes a series of constructive
comments on a range of issues.
However, it takes a disappointing
stance on the question of
expanding student access to the
college. Imperial College would
not be prepared to take on bright
i n d i v i d u a l s who do not,
unfortunately, have the necessary
formal qualifications. Due to the
advanced nature of courses
offered at IC, A Levels are felt to
be necessary if students are to
cope with their studies. However,
the College is dismissive of
'conversion' courses, which
could allow suitable unqualified
students to reach the necessary
level of understanding for entry
to degree courses. This is,
perhaps, surprising in view of
press reports following rioting
such areas as Brixton and
Toxteth which suggested that
Imperial College would be
prepared to take on just such
underprivileged youngsters. The
College does, however, call for an
i n c r e a s e in the o v e r a l l
participation rate in Higher
Education, and this is to be
welcomed.
The College could also be
accused of taking an unduly self-
interested view in calling for a
shift of students towards science
and engineering courses. College
knows full well that the
Government is likely to use any
excuse to further attack the
teaching of Arts and Humanities,
thus restricting student choice of
courses in what is, after all,
supposed to be a free country.
The response fails to point out
that degrees in scientific and
engineering subjects cost
approximately twice as much as
degrees in Arts subjects.
The College feels that no useful
purpose would be served in
reducing degree lengths to two
years or by lengthening the
academic year to accommodate
this. It also favours an increase in
