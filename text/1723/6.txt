time for our
third instalment! Having
laid the correct framework
for your ideas and per-
formed your background
research, we now discuss
how you realise your
ideas in practical terms....
Funding
Having validated
your idea, your primary
concerns will be
economic. Where do you
get the funds to realise
your app? If you are in a
position to self fund, fan-
tastic! Greater risk equals
greater reward. If you
are not, you have several
options. These include
obtaining grants, angel
funding, venture capital
and even crowdsourcing.
There is a wealth of infor-
mation online regarding
each of these avenues. It
is important to remember
that you will be giving up
equity in your business to
obtain these funds (suc-
cessfully obtaining a grant
being the exception).
Most app start-ups go
through multiple rounds
of fundraising to cater to
their different stages of
growth. As you become
more successful, the
amount of equity you give
up reduces as the risk to

ups at different

investors is minimised.
Many universities and
financial institutions offer
incubators where accepted
start-ups are mentored
through the entire process
and introduced to poten-
tial funders. These are
powerful tools for a young
start-up but do remember
that you will probably be
giving up equity and po-
tentially IP rights too. In
fact there are programmes
in place that cater to start-
ups at different stages of
their growth, scalability
awards being a prime
example.
Getting it built
First question, do you
have someone capable of
building your platform?
If you or a partner are a
computing whizz and are
able, wonderful! Failing
that, there are several
things to consider (and
these typically revolve
around simple eco-
nomics). If you’re well
funded, you can approach
a local company to build
your platform for you. If
you aren’t, you can source
a partner capable of doing
so. This will again involve
giving up equity in your
company. Another option
is to outsource. There
are many websites which
allow you to put your
ideas out to tender. Devel-
opers will then compete
for your job. Having a non
disclosure agreement here
is valuable. You can find
simple templates for these
online although most
freelance developers will
already have their own.
There are always success
and sob stories when
dealing with developers,
regardless the route taken.
Dealing with devel-
opers overseas is notori-
ously challenging. Being
able to relay technical
information to someone
who speaks English as
a second (third, or even
fourth) language is not
easy. Culture can also
dictate branding and the
way your platform may
look. Hence, a hybrid
approach might be the
most sensible option.
Many UK based develop-
ment houses will offer a
cut price prototype service
where they provide high
res mock ups of how your
platform should look and
function. They may also
have input to colourways
and branding. All this IP
belongs to you and you
can then hand this over
to someone overseas who
can code at a fraction of
the cost.
No matter the route you
decide, it’s important to
frame the project correctly
and to ensure that payment
is made based upon com-
pletion of milestones or
deliverables. This will be
worded into your contract.
It is important to ensure
that you own the rights to
everything, especially in
the unfortunate instance
of this relationship turning
sour. You must also
ensure that your platform
is not shared with anyone
else without your express
permission.
Marketing
You obviously want
your core audience to
download and use your
app. In most cases the
key to success is market-
ing. Not just in terms of
having a healthy market-
ing budget but having a
targeted marketing plan.
Utilising social media
is immensely powerful.
You can advertise on
Facebook and Instagram.
This is more sophisticated
than most would think
and allows you to reach
specific audience demo-
graphics and locations.
The price for this service is
also not prohibitive. Local
advertising campaigns
(think leaflets, posters and
placards) and trade shows
are also helpful.
As you grow, you
may want to seek the
assistance of a marketing
specialist who will help
you get your message to
your target audience.

be detailing our app
‘Impromptu’ and its back
