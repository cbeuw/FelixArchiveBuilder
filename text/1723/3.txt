O
n Friday 17th
May, Men-
tality hosted
a talk from
Rosie Dutt (BSc, MSc,
MRes) on Mental Health
Systems in the UK and
Abroad. Rosie came in
to discuss her Mental
Health placement that
she will be undertaking
over this summer in a
psychiatric facility in
Bali; as well as to talk
about the differences in
the mental health sys-
tems in the UK, the US
and south eastern Asia.
Thereafter, Rosie will
A comparison of mental health systems in the UK, US
and Asia
go on to study for a PhD
in the US with a focus
on imaging applications
within mental health.
The talk addressed
the differences between
private and public mental
health services, with
respect to the whole
referral process from GP
appointment through to
a patient’s first therapy
session in the UK, com-
pared to using the private
system in the US, which
involves multiple return
visits and the trialling
of various medications,
often due to the push for
pharmaceutical profit
in private healthcare.
However, Rosie stressed
the idea that both of
these developed nations
have established and well
organised, albeit slightly
different guidelines for
diagnosing and treating
mental health disorders.
She went on to compare
the mental healthcare
systems in the UK and the
US to those in Bali, ex-
plaining that the outlook
on mental illnesses
remains outdated. Rosie
showed images of a
technique they use in Bali
called “pasung”, which
entails the shackling of
people showing signs of
psychological disabilities
in order to restrain them
in isolation. Although
banned in 1977, she ex-
plained that the practise is
not well regulated in rural
areas and that it remains
regularly carried out, both
in formal institutions and
in a domestic setting.
Rosie’s talk went on to
show a case study of a man
who underwent Pasung
for 12 years, before his
family were approached
by community workers
and taught how to better
approach mental health
illnesses and the treat-
ment for them, including
therapy and medication.
The man went on to be
the breadwinner for the
family after successful
treatment, proving that
community schemes are
improving the wellbeing
of mental health patients
in Bali.
Rosie will be heading
to Indonesia herself this
summer to undertake a
PhD placement in a psy-
chiatric facility in Bali,
and is currently raising
funds for this. Mentality
is supporting Rosie in this
venture, and would like
to invite Felix readers to
help her out through her
fundraising page.
For anyone who is
interested in being more
involved in hosting
talks similar to Rosie’s,
as well as continuing
to raise awareness for
mental health awareness
and wellbeing around
Imperial, Mentality is still

[Hannah Bannister] is
planning, so there’s defi-
nitely a lot of support from
above”. However, this in-
creased financial support
for the service has failed
to translate to increased
support for the students
due to the persisting issue
of finding increased space
on campus for the service.
Claire explained this
to Felix, stating: “Last
summer, we were allo-
cated in the budget three
full-time equivalent coun-
sellors, which is positive;
but, consequently, we
weren’t given or allocated
the space to go with the
resource.” Claire went
on to describe how the
service has attempted to
navigate these challenges:
“We tried to think crea-
tively and we went ahead
and we’ve recruited. We
couldn’t recruit for the
three full-time because
we haven’t got the space.
We rented some rooms in
SALC [the Seminar and
Learning Centre], which
aren’t ideal because…
they’re meeting rooms.
They’ve got meeting room
furniture, counsellors
up there are constantly
interrupted by people just
walking into the rooms,
and you might have dis-
tressed students in there.”
The importance of an
adequate, professional
space in which both the
student and counsellor
feel comfortable can’t
be overstated, as Claire
and Mark stressed to
Felix: “Just like a doctor
needs a consulting room
or a surgeon needs an
operating theatre, mental
health professionals need
a professional space that
respects the student in
supporting them. It’s
about us feeling that we
are grounded and can offer
that professional support
because we’re talking
with students about what’s
distressing them or what
they’re concerned about
and you don’t want to be
interrupted.” However,
the vital importance of
such a room is often
“misunderstood” because
counselling and mental
health advice is often seen
as “just a chat”. This is
vehemently not the case.
Speaking specifically
about the Mental Health
Advisory service, Mark
contested: “We offer a
skilled conversation with
a mental health profes-
sional. We refer people on
if we need to or we liaise
with GPs. I think the main
thing we do is try to see
people through their time
here and offer a check-in.”
The requirements for a
professional counselling
space, which include
soundproofing, privacy
and natural light, as well
as somewhere that is
consistently available, so
students “know the same
space or room they’re
turning up to”, and some-
where that feels safe for
the students that’s not
directly in their academic
faculty where they can be
seen going in or accessing
support. Claire explained,
“if you’re with a student
that’s very distressed or
very depressed, being in a
basement or a windowless
room is not good”.
is very difficult”, Mark
told Felix. Another diffi-
culty that has presented
itself is the fact that,
despite the fact that the
service is part of Imperial,
it needs to “sot a little
bit separate”, in order
to provide students with
some separation from
their day-to-day routine.
This spacing issue has
effectively left the service
down on resourcing,
despite being allocated
extra resources. As Mark
concisely puts it, it’s akin
to having “more surgeons
but no more operating
theatres”. Despite com-
promising by making
use of meeting rooms in
SALC in an attempt to
“put the students first”,
this has done little to
improve the situation for a
counselling service facing
ever increasing footfall.
Recent research suggests
that there has been a
50% UK-wide increase
in student demand for
mental health services and
Imperial is no exception.
Claire told Felix, “we’ve
so far seen just over 1300
students – that’s combined
with both teams – this
academic year." These
students are "across all
faculties, all departments,
all levels, from under-
graduate to postdoc to
research". This is already
an increase on the 1013
students that accessed
the Student Counselling
and Mental Health
Advice service in the
2016/17 academic year
and represents alleged
12% and 50% increases
in the number of students
accessing the Counselling
and Mental Health Advice
services, respectively,
compared to last year.
“By the time we get to the
end of this academic year,
it’s going to be 60% up on
last year”, predicts Mark.
This increased demand,
coupled with the restricted
resourcing, has had a pre-
dictably detrimental effect
on waiting times. Students
accessing the Counselling
Service will have an initial
assessment, following
which they will receive
counselling, if deemed
appropriate. Students
then have access to seven
counselling sessions for
the year in what is referred
to as a “brief therapeutic
model” – the majority of
the students will make use
of four of these sessions,
which is in line with
the national average for
universities. Last year, the
wait time between initial
assessment and counsel-
ling was reported to be
seven weeks. This year,
that is up to eight weeks.
The service determines
who to see first based on
need, ensuring the most
vulnerable students are
seen the quickest; time
spent on the waiting list
is also taken into account
to prevent those with
lower-level problems
being left indefinitely. It
is also important to note
that, if a student discloses
risk – which they can do
via email or on the online
Counselling Referral form
– there is a duty counsel-
lor that works to expedite
said student’s assessment,
if appropriate.
Although the system for
the Mental Health Advice
service is very different,
its similarly disappointing
waiting time is also a
reflection of the increased
student demand and inad-
equate resourcing. Mark
explained to Felix: “Staff
often phone us, so we talk
to staff about students a
lot, often anonymously.
We do that continually;
there’s obviously no wait
for that but, if a student
is referred, we always
endeavour to see the
student within a working
week. However we’re not
achieving that, we’re just
absolutely not. These are
quite important referrals;
it’s important enough for
a student to have gone to
their tutor and it’s impor-
tant enough for the tutor to
have been concerned and
feeling that they can’t sort
it, that it needs someone
with some mental health
expertise, so they are all
quite urgent”. Again, it is
important to note that, in
this case, if a referral flags
up significant distress,
there will often be a
response within 24 hours.
There are many theories
behind why there has
been an observed increase
in student demand for
mental health services, in-
cluding a reduced stigma
“It's a
containing
anchor space”
around mental health
leading to people being
more comfortable talking
about it. Claire concurs,
saying: “Mental health is
becoming less of a taboo.
It’s being spoken about,
it’s in the press, the stigma
is greatly diminishing and
that’s healthy and that’s
how it should be. With
the media talking about
mental health more, it’s on
everybody’s agenda. With
that, there’s an increase
in demand.” One factor
that could also explain
the increase observed at
Imperial is the introduc-
tion of the Counselling
service’s online self-refer-
ral form. This came in at
the start of this academic
year and allows students
easier and quicker access
to the service, leading to
an inevitable increase in
the number of referrals.
Another contributing
factor, and perhaps the
largest, is the academic
pressure and widely
perceived competitive
culture that exists at
Russell Group universi-
ties like Imperial. Claire
explained: “This College
draws a certain type of
student that is very gifted
or very academically able
and talented and, with
that, a lot of students want
to do well and are used
to doing well; that’s part
of their identity, it’s part
of how they see them-
selves. When you have a
whole cohort of students
coming, that are all very
gifted and very bright and
very driven… you get
this culture where there is
academic competition and
that then creates internally
within students a pressure
to compete. Sometimes,
when that gets a bit dis-
torted, they can become
quite self-critical and
quite punitive.” Shervin
Sabeghi,incomingDeputy
President (Welfare) for
2019/20, told Felix: “It’s
hard to deny that there is
an air of competition but
I think it’s more about the
way people respond to
that”. When the question
of whether it is the univer-
sity’s duty to tackle this
culture was put to them,
both Claire and Mark
agreed that considering
it a “dual responsibility”
is the “healthy way” to
approach the issue. “It
should be both the student
taking ownership and
responsibility for their
own mental health and
psychological wellbeing
and obviously the College
has a duty of care as well”,
Claire added. “What they
are trying to think about
is what they are in control
of in terms of adding extra
pressure. Conversations
around when exams are
sat, how many should be
put into a week, the stuff
that the university is in
control of”. The example
of the College taking
measures so as not to exac-
erbate pre-exam and exam
time pressure and stress is
particularly pertinent as
the Counselling service
sees spikes during these
periods, often made worse
by the exam schedule.
It’s easy to see the
issues facing the Student
Counselling & Mental
Health advice service as
a problem which only
affects students but, with
recent research showing
that employees are three
times more likely to
discuss physical ailments
over mental health issues
at work, it is important to
also highlight the affect
that these persisting issues
have on staff. Mark ex-
plained to Felix: “We’ve
got a very experienced,
professionally qualified
team here with huge
amounts of experience
in dealing with students’
mental health and hugely
experienced counsellors.
We’re passionate about
what we’re doing, we
want to provide the best
care and to not be able to
do that in a timely way
is very frustrating for us;
the biggest effect on us
is frustration. Our overall
feeling is frustration
because we can’t quite
do what we want to do
and what we’re able
to do.” This effect has
been noticed by students
interacting with these
staff, particularly those
involved in the Union’s
Wellbeing Representation
Network.
through in the provision
for the Student Coun-
selling & Mental Health
Advice service. Accord-
ing to Claire, Hannah
Bannister [Director of
Student Services] has been
“really endeavouring and
working hard to try and
find space”. At the time of
writing, a potential space
on the Hammersmith
campus which could be
converted into two very
small consulting rooms
is under site review. If
the space is found to be
viable, the process will
be expedited such that it
is made available for 1st
August. Question marks
stillsurroundtheprovision

across campuses, particu-
larly with the College’s
expansion into White
City, but this development
could mark the start of an
upturn in fortunes for the
counselling service.
Claire ended the dis-
cussion with Felix with
the following important
message: “One of the first
things I say to a student
when I’m with them in
that kind of session is
it takes a lot of bravery
sometimes to come and
sit with a stranger, albeit
a mental health profes-
sional, a counsellor in a
confidential space, it takes
some courage. Accessing
mental health or coun-
selling support is a sign
of strength. It’s a sign of
strength because you’re
actually prioritising
yourself”.
Although the wider
issue of how space is
managed within College
persists, there may have
been a recent break-
Claire went on to
explain that, when
booking rooms, priority
is given to the academic
schools, especially with
meeting rooms. As a
result, the choices left
available to the Student
Counselling & Mental
Health service is limited.
“I think the difficulty
we’ve encountered is each
faculty feels it owns its
own space… and to break
