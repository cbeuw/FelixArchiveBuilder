T
he exhibition
‘AI: More
Than Human’
(explored in
the previous issue of
Felix) is taking place at
the Barbican right now,
where visitors can explore
the topic of artificial
intelligence and machine
learning, spanning back
to the Middle Ages, then
jumping to 1940’s Alan
Turing to today’s newest
gimmicks in the field. In
my eyes, the exhibition
gives rise to more ques-
tions than it does answers.
In an attempt to answer
some of these questions, I
spoke to Takashi Ikegami,
professor at the University
of Tokyo and one of the
main (human) brains
behind Alter 3.
Hi Takashi! Your
background is a
doctorate in Physics,
and today you have
your own AI lab in
Tokyo, Japan. How
come your career took
this turn, were you
always interested in
AI?
Basically, I am interest-
ed in what life is. People,
or even physicists like
Schrödinger, the father of
quantum mechanics, want
to know why some matter
becomes life, and some
matter doesn’t, and what
the distinction between
the two is. Then came the
personal computer back in
the 80’s, and now every-
body has a computer.
There’s still so many
things to discover, and
that’s how I started doing
systems studies. We didn’t
call it AI, we call it “A(r-
tifical) Life”, life comes
first, intelligence might
come as a by-product or a
side effect.
What would you
define as life?
Well it’s a difficult
question, but humans are
the ones who decide what
is and isn’t life. We came
up with the Turing test.
The Turing test is a more
language based distinc-
tion between human and
non-human. You interact
with an android and judge
how human-like they are.
It’s based on a lot more
than just appearance,
but once you think you
could be in love with her/
him, and you don’t care
whether it’s a machine or
not, that’s when we’ve
reached the goal.
Would you say there is
artificial intelligence
that meets this
standard already?
Well, people don’t
really know what artificial
intelligence is. Already,
computers can calculate
much faster than humans,
but people shouldn’t
call it AI. It’s difficult
because people call what
is essentially just machine
learning AI. So we’re not
at that level yet.
Do you think we’ll
know when we get
there?
Hopefully. But I’m
not sure. Like I said, on
some level people don’t
care what something is
made out of, whether it’s
a computer programme
or not. When you become
friends with someone,
you don’t just suddenly
stop liking them or stop
being friends with them
because they consist of a
programme. That’s why
artificial life is more im-
portant than artificial in-
telligence. Artificial life is
more about how you can
interact with the mind, if
there is such a thing as the
mind. Mind can emerge
on top of computational
processes and chemical
processes.
You are part of the
team that created
Alter 3, which can
be seen here at the
Barbican right now
as part of the “AI:
More than Human”
exhibition. Would you
describe that as life?
We don’t call it life,
but we do think it is a
different type of robot. It’s
an alternative robot in the
sense that it is not based
on the task, it’s not based
on computational func-
tions, instead it is based
on artificial life principles.
Alter 3 has been given
the basic task to mimic a
human being. If a person
steps up in front of Alter
3, he will try to mimic the
person, but also to consult
his memory of behaviours
to try and pick up and
match the human in front
of him. He will try to
retrieve past behaviours
from his memory.
So Alter 3 shows
machine learning?
Alter 3 shows machine
learning, yes, but the basic
processes behind it we
call Darwinian evolution,
picking up one pose and
making a variation of it,
attached to the memory.
So a memory organisation
is built. The personality of
Alter 3 arises from these
complex memory-tree
structures.
Do you feel like you
have a personal
relationship with Alter
3?
Yeah, I do think so. The
more time you spend with
Alter, the more you start
to like him. I feel like I
want to know more about
him.
Takashi, you are
obviously a scientist,
but do you consider
yourself an artist as
well?
Yeah I consider
myself an artist after 5
pm. When you conduct
scientific research, you
have to produce papers
for journals, and that’s
what everything revolves
around. However, there’s
a lot of things you can’t
show through simple
figures and numbers. Art
is a totally different way
to present these ideas to
people, and can be easily
understood.
In your work you’ve
stated the theory that
the mind emerges
from mass flow of
data. Would you
say this school of
thought makes you
different from other
researchers in the
field that might take
a more reductionist
approach?
Yeah, usually people
think life emerges from
neural networks. One of
my theories is based on
the work of artist Nam
June Paik. Usually you
build a robot in a laborato-
ry-setting and you experi-
ment on it there. But Paik
took the robot to the city.
And in the city the robot
was hit by a car, and then
became the first robot to
ever have been involved
in a traffic accident. The
world is so messy, so
complex, and that’s the
challenge you’re really
facing in all of this. I think
the difference between
Alter 3 and other robots
has to do with its complex
environment. Autonomy
is not performing random
acts regardless of what’s
going on in the environ-
ment, life-like autonomy
is interacting with your
environment. The mind
is not encapsulated in the
body, the mind is con-
stantly interacting with
the environment. Alter 3
is not trying to stop the
massive data flow, instead
to receive it all and be
more adaptive towards it.
Where do you see
artificial intelligence
going in the next
decade?
The market needs more
robot-to-robot interaction.
It might be interesting for
creating a new kind of
mathematics. I always
think of the human as a
bottleneck. With big data,
AI don’t need to visualise
and write down equations
like we do. They just go
from big data to big data,
bypassing the rest. They
can therefore create their
own mathematics and
own languages. How
we understand things is
different from how AI
understands things, so
we need better translation
between these two.
After talking to
Ikegami I’m left pon-
dering about AI and the
definition of life. Could
the future really contain
some sort of Ex Machi-
na-style androids for us
to fall in love with? Will a
version of Alter 3 one day
be someone I come home
to find on the couch,
eating Ben & Jerry’s and
watching Love Island?
I can’t help but view
Takashi Ikegami as a bit
of a Victor Frankenstein,
perhaps a misunderstood
genius, but so devoted to
his craft of creating life
that this might not be the
last we hear from him.

exhibition’s humanoid robot: Alter 3.
