o you want to
play Smash
with sass and
style? Perhaps
you’re a swordfighter,
looking for a change up in
weaponry, maybe some-
thing with a bit more brute
force, maybe a mallet? Do
you wish to infuriate your
opponent by living to the
most obscene of percent-
ages, coming back each
time to serve a mightier
clobbering than the last?
Most importantly, do
you want to summon the
image of ultimate perfec-
tion, simply by holding
down on the left-stick? If
you answered yes to any
of the above, the King of
Dreamland has it all.
On the ground, Dedede
has numerous options
to pile on pressure and
keep his rivals out. Most
notably, his forward tilt
makes him reach out with
a spinning mallet, and it
outranges most characters’
swords or close quarters
combat options. His up
tilt is good for covering
the air, keeping airborne
fighters in check and
creating aerial follow-ups,
and his down tilt makes
him roll into his oppo-
nents, setting up consist-
ent tech situations and jab
lock combos. To finish up
his grounded arsenal, dash
attacking will send this
flightless fellow into an
all-in dive across the stage
- a high-risk high-reward
option which can also kill
at higher percentages. The
hitbox also lingers for a
while, enabling two-frame
punishes at the ledge.
While he may be a
penguin, Dedede’s aerial
game is nothing to sneeze
at either. On top of strong
aerial attacks, he has a
total of four jumps, giving
him strong recovery
and makes him a huge
threat (figuratively and
literally) vertically. His
jumping jack-like neutral
air comes out extremely
fast, trading favourably
with aerial opposition in
almost all instances, and
fast falling out of n-air
(normal air) also allows
you to combo into grabs,
jabs, tilts, or even another
n-air, making it a decent
approach option. Looking
at his other aerials, his
back air swing is his go-to
aerial option when going
for a knockout thanks to
its high knockback. His
n-air, fair and up air are
all good followups to his
down throw, allowing you
to tack on damage early in
the game.
The real flair in
Dedede’s gameplay
comes from his Specials.
His neutral Special, the
Inhale, sucks anything
from projectiles to
whole opponents into his
stomach, doubling as both
a command grab and a
projectile reflector. This
move is also the source
for some of the funniest
and most undeserved
stocks you can achieve
in the game. In a rough
spot off-stage and your
opponent is too close to
the ledge? Simply hold
down that B button as
you descend, suck your
opponent in, and spit them
under the stage leaving
them sweating to make it
back to stage, or simply
drop gracefully into the
void of the bottom Smash
Box and take them with
you.
This goes hand in hand
with his own projectile,
the Gordo - a sentient
spiky bouncy ball that can
“I do not like this painting Charlie, it’s smug aura mocks me” // Nintendo + IASIP
“He shines
most in
dealing with
his victims
off stage -
possessing
some of the
best edge
guarding”
be thrown with his side
special, and can cause a
lot of damage, and even
has the chance of sticking
to the ledges to give recov-
ering fighters hell. Combo
this with the Inhale to
send the Gordo at your
opponents with even more
speed and stopping power.
His Up Special, the
Super Jump, sends him
flying upwards, and
eventually crashing
downwards to devastating
effect when landed on
an opponent on stage.
This does have immense
end-lag and is by far the
most punishable move in
his arsenal however, so
it is best used to simply
make it back to the ledge.
The insane vertical gain
on this move, along with
multiple jumps, serves as
the basis for his recovery
and allows him to make
it back from seemingly
anywhere. Lastly, his
down Special, the Jet
Hammer, is a chargeable
mechanised swing of his
already hefty hammer,
which has super armour
and the ability to break
shields when charged
up. This can be used in
combination with Gordos
at the ledge to force your
opponent into unfavoura-
ble get-up situations that
can give you the lead.
In terms of overall
gameplan, Dedede is a de-
fensive heavy, best played
by keeping approaching
opposition out with his
disjointed tilts and strong
aerials, while also creating
openings and condition-
ing the opponent with his
projectile and multiple
jumps.
He shines most in
dealing with his victims
offstage-possessingsome
of the best edge guarding
and ledge trapping tools
in the game, he’s able to
maintain this advantage
state to ensure a stock.
Unlike his other heavy
peers, Dedede excels in
the air thanks to his four
jumps and high-reaching
Up Special. This allows
him to chase deep off-
stage, while being able to
make it back from what
would be unreachable for
most of the cast without a
scratch.
He is an exceptionally
solid mid-tier pick. Re-
gardless of his strengths, it
doesn’t save him from his
lack of approach options,
making patient play and
zoning against him very
effective and difficult to
break. His rotund body
habitus also makes him
pretty difficult to miss,
further making him sus-
ceptible to lengthy combo
strings when in disadvan-
tage, allowing rush-down
characters to quickly rack
up free damage on him.
All is not woes for this
merry monarch though
- even with his glaring
weaknesses, playing with
patience, foresight and
active planning will gain
you the most mileage with
this character. Use his
heavy status and amazing
recovery to live to really
high percents, and this
will give you more inter-
actions to partake in and
study, buying you the time
to download and adapt to
the other player’s habits,
and capitalize in ways
nobody else in the cast
can.
Despite his flaws,
you can’t really knock
self-proclaimed perfec-
tion. If you are interested
in learning more about
this engorged, flightless
bird, YouTubers such as
D3nsity produce dedicat-
ed content, with detailed
matchup guides and tech
tutorials. The Dedediscord
on Smashcords also has
a plethora of guides and
resources, including a 9
page document dedicated
to Gordo tech alone. So
what are you waiting for?
Pick up the mallet and
find the true King within
yourselves!
