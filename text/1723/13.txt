Ground-Breaking Hackathon to make meat without
animals
SUSTAINABILITY

alling on all
s c i e n t i s t s ,
e n g i n e e r s ,
business stu-
dents and hackers! Do
you want to harness the
power of technology and
join the revolution? You
are invited to use your
skills and passion at the
world’s first “Cellular
Agriculture Hackathon
at Imperial”
Cellular agriculture is
the process of growing
cells to make agricultural
products. Growing meat
and milk without using
animals is not only an ex-
traordinary feat scientif-
ically, but also addresses
some of the major issues
of our generation: climate
crisis, antibiotic resist-
ance, resource scarcity
amongst others. Cur-
rently, meat production
is responsible for more
greenhouse gas emissions
than the entire transpor-
tation sector combined.
It is also the main driver
of biodiversity loss and
deforestation. As well as
being unsustainable, if
considered pragmatically,
meat production is highly
inefficient. For example
chickens only convert
11% of what they eat into
mentors who are experts
in the following domains:
cell culture, engineering,
marketing and innovation
management.
If you are looking to
network with other driven
hackers or dive into the
field of cellular agricul-
ture this event is for you!
Here’s what you will gain
contribute to solving the
greatest challenges of our
time, dive into the field of
cellular agriculture and its
opportunities, show off
your talents, network and
meet people as passionate
as you are, get a chance of
winning large cash prizes,
and finally, with a free
book and food to top!
The hackathon will
begin with a launch event
on Monday 3rd June at
the Advanced Hackspace,
at Imperial White City
campus, with talks by sci-
entists, entrepreneurs and
influential actors in the
Imperial College to to host first Cellular Agriculture Hackathon from Monday 3rd June - Tuesday 4th June. Limited
places open to students from all disciplines

meat, yet this is the highest
caloric conversion rate for
any land-based animal.
This suggests there is
room for invention!
With your help, we
could achieve a sustaina-
ble process of meat pro-
duction which can meet
the growing worldwide
demand for food, with a
fraction of the environ-
mental impact and animal
suffering.
The field of cellular
agriculture began in 2013
when the first cell-based,
“lab grown” burger was
made by Mark Post. It
is currently facing four
main challenges: reducing
costs for resources such
as growth mediums and
cell sources, engineering
tissue scaffolds to mimic
the in-vivo myogenesis
environment, scaling up
into commercial scale
bioprocessing, and finally,
marketing to aid customer
adoption. You will be able
to choose which of these
issues to tackle.
This hackathon is not
limited to meat only. It
is open to any potential
application of cellular
agriculture even leather!
We are recruiting talent
from all academic areas to
facilitate collaboration.
It will be guided by
Benjamina Bollag, the
CEO and founder of
Higher Steaks, a UK clean
meat start up. There will
also be a large team of
