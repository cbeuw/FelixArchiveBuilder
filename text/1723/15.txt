#WhiteSexLivesMatter movement gains traction after
white Europeans black-balled from sex survey
HANGMAN
The annual NegaFelix sex survey has drawn criticism after failing to include a major ethnic group in the data collection.

P
artakers of
white European
descent were
incensed when
they found themselves
unable to identify
themselves in the survey
questionnaire.
Question 4 of 69, which
asked for the individual’s
ethnic background, failed
to acknowledge the
existence of non-British/
Irish white people, with
the only white ethnicities
acknowledged being
those indigenous to these
islands.
Montplaisant, who spear-
headed the campaign, was
adamant in his campaign’s
decision. “This is cultural
erasure, pure and simple,”
he exclaimed in irritation.
“We refuse to be made
into token whites, we are
people who have sex too!”
he said, speaking on the
gaffe. “I really couldn’t
give a shit whether or
not they had sex with a
custard crème tart, I’m
just trying to get content
for next week. Plus, why
are they even talking?

“I’d love to
say I did it on
purpose but
that’s giving
myself too
much credit”
“We refuse to
be made into
token whites,
we are people
who have sex
too!”
As frustrated students
vented on social media,
the hashtag #WhiteSex-
LivesMatter was started
by the Facebook page ‘Im-
perial College Indecently
Exposed’ over the per-
ceived slight. The move,
however, subsequently
evolved into a full-blown
campaign, looking to raise
awareness of the struggles
faced by Caucasians in
their sex lives.
Guillaume du
Liberation Officers
have moved to rally
behind the campaign,
gaining funding to
support it from the Union.
John Smith, White and
Majority Ethnic (WAME)
Students Officer, told of
his disappointment at the
survey, stating that they
were symptomatic of a
much larger problem at
Imperial. “As someone
whose family has had to
endure historic oppres-
sion, I find this to be com-
pletely unacceptable,” he
thundered. “Life doesn’t
come easily to people like
me - do you know how
hard it is to have an ethnic
name like mine? There are
so many assumptions that
come with it.”
Calls for an apology
from the NegaFelix
editor, Akim Djamba, was
met with nonchalance.
“I’d love to say I did it on
purpose but that’s giving
myself too much credit,”
I swear Brexit means
Brexit; who cares about
them anyway.” Mr
Djamba has previously
been alleged to support-
ing questionable fringe
groups on campus, most
recently a campaign to
replace Pieminster with
a Caribbean takeaway
under the guise of diversi-
fication.
The annual sex survey
was initiated in 1998,
after mass hysteria during
an STI epidemic dragged
the already low sexual
activity at Imperial to
near zero. The hope had
been that doing so would
encourage Imperial stu-
dents to get frisky with
one another.

A concept to connect
diseased patients
with desperate
students has been
awarded £10,000 by
the Business School to
develop their business
plan.

T
he platform,
Sickr, aims to
help students
in need of
mitigating circumstances
connect with infectious
patients, in order to avoid
exams or submission
deadlines.
Diana Rhea and Seb T.
Semia, both on the MSc
Innovation, Entrepreneur-
ship and Management
course, received the
funding after participating
in one of the money-grab-
bing schemes available to
Business School students
last week.
“Sometimes we go into
the library, to see how the
other half live,” Ms Rhea
said, “and we always hear
people sobbing and saying
‘kill me now’ or ‘why
couldn’t I get tetanus too’.
So we thought, this is a
captive market that will
always be refreshed and
importantly will move
on before they suffer the
worst of the side effects ”
desired infection. For a
small additional payment
preminum members
secure acess to required
medication once the
deadline has passed.
The Dean of the
Business School, Frank-
incense Velocirapto,
praised the students for
their ingenuity. “Imperial
means Intelligent Bullshit,
and that’s exactly what
these students have done.
They’ve spotted an oppor-
tunity and built a business
to exploit it to its full
potential. This is the kind
of entrepreneurship we
breed here at Imperial.”
Concerns as to the
ethics of the venture were
dismissed by the Col-
lege’s CFO (Crusty Fiscal
Opening), Mair Patterson.
“Stop fucking asking me
dumb shit,” he snapped. “
As long as they pay their
goddamn fees I don’t
care what happens to the
damn students - they’d
probably be waiting for a
Counselling appointment
anyway..”

Why does somebody not

DIS-GOS-TANG!!
This week you finally
say hi to your library

Turns out he’s actually

This week you’re worried
about filling out the Sex

because really, how many
Mongolian non-binary
polyamorous people in
Earth Sciences can there
possibly be.
This week you’re Boris
Johnson.
That’s it. You’re the joke.
This week you smuggle
hot food into the library
a-la-cartel.
It tastes like ass.
This week you’re the
Union cameraman asked
to capture Imperial’s
diversity.
The cameras flash.
The rugby lads remove

You’re terrified of tiny
