Dog Without Feathers
T
ransport yourself
to the dried-out
Capibaribe River
in north-eastern
Brazil, where ‘crab men’
covered in mud desperate-
ly try to survive the harsh,
violent environment,
where water is scarce and
life is returned to its primal
origins. Dog Without
Feathers is a virtuostic
dance production by the
award-winning choreog-
rapher Deborah Colker.
Based on Joao Cabral de
Melo Neto’s poem Dog
Without Feathers, the
experimental dance-cum-
film embodies the poem
in movement, whilst
combining classical, con-
temporary and ritualistic
dances in an intense and
passionate manner. It
brings even the desolate,
cracking landscape into
motion, in a spectacular
fashion I did not know
possible.
The visceral perfor-
mance immerses the
audience into life on the
edge, with the mythol-
ogy of people living on
Brazil’s Capibaribe River
seamlessly intertwined
with suffering and
tragedy. With the dancers’
skin-coloured costumes
and mud-slicked hair,
their dehumanisation is
embodied through their
primal passion. Their
contrasting anguish and
exuberance speaks of our
dependence and careless
disregard for nature and
our environment, whilst
also highlighting the
inequalities of Brazilian
life. Through this, Colker
effectively conceptualizes
both geographical and
human nature. The perfor-
mance speaks to a deeper
part of the audience’s soul,
asking us to contemplate
the inconceivable and
unimaginable aspects of
the human condition.
We were brought on a
journey from the dried-
out river banks, to a lone
crab, to the sugarcane
plantations, and to a
mangrove teeming with
life. The simple set design
and black-and-white
film reflected the empty
and deprived landscape,
allowing us to focus on
the dancers themselves.
This was exemplified by
the lighting design that
cast brilliant and effective
shadows, transporting
us into a different world.
Within each movement,
the dancers were intense
and powerful, moving
in perfect synchrony to
embody the scene and
bring the audience on an
adventure as the poem
was transversed.
The beautiful, fluid
shapes created by the
dancers were deliberately
contrasted with their
perfectly timed and harsh
movements, highlighting
the guttural nature of these
communities that were in
perfect synchrony with
the raw beauty of nature.
Whilst filled with
passion and drama, there
were points where some
of the intense energy lost
its way and seemed to
drag on. Perhaps this was
intentional, reflecting the
people’s return to basic re-
quirements and the loss of
energy as their struggled
to survive the long days
and months. However, it
also took away from the
captivating world they
had worked so hard to
transport us to. Nonethe-
less, the world created is
one that leaves you con-
templating human nature
and our environment.
Overall, I was pleas-
antly surprised at how
effective dance is as a
communication tool that
transcends all languages
and practices, and gave
me a newfound apprecia-
tion of the ways in which
we can express ourselves.
The performance beauti-
fully combined cinema,
poetry, music and dance to
transport the audience into
a different, enthralling
world. At the same time,
it effectively delivered
a pertinent message on
humanity and nature, and
left us reflecting on our
own lives and practices.
Operation Black Antler
S
itting alone in the
dark, on a bench
in a South London
park waiting for a
text from my ‘handler’, I
felt as though I had found
myself at the blunt end of
the biggest practical joke
since the admin team at
the 2017 Oscars switched
the winner’s envelopes.
Instructed to remain vig-
ilant for any ‘suspicious
activity’, it’s fair to say
that I was absolutely
bricking it! Eventually,
however, the rest of my
team arrived and after a
brief introduction we did
indeed receive instruc-
tions from our handler.
Operation Black Antler
is an immersive theatre
experience, and this really
was whatever you made of
it. You are talked through
how to come up with an
effective false identity
and told to construct a
back story explaining how
you and your team know
each other. The more you
throw yourself into your
new alias, the more fun
you have… And you’ll
be surprised how hard it
can be to remember your
alias’ name in the heat of
the moment - I certainly
messed it up at least once,
ironic since you keep the
same Christian name!
Not only does this alias
have to have a history,
they also have to possess
some pretty strong views
on immigration and
Brexit, all in order to get
closer to your targets.
I found myself making
some very inflammatory
claims and statements in
a South London pub to
people I had never met,
all in the attempt to gain
some ‘intelligence’. By
the end of the evening, I
had sympathised with a
Luton based Anti-Islamic
protester and arranged
a meeting the following
Saturday with the head of
the EDL – not my usual
Thursday evening out!
As a piece of theatre,
this evening was faultless.
I spent the entire evening
unable to differentiate
between actors, members
of the public and fellow
guests.
If you are someone
who feels uncomfortable
talking to strangers, who
is overly cautious about
what you say, or who is
uneasy about breaking
into fenced compounds
behind gymnasia, then
perhaps give this a miss.
However, if you are
the sort of person who
reads MI5 biographies
and watches Line of
Duty thinking ‘I wonder
whether I could do that?’,
then this is certainly for
you! Not your standard
trip to the theatre, this ex-
perience requires concen-
tration, nous and above all
the ability to completely
suspend reality for one
sensational evening.
