n an economically
uncertain environ-
ment subject to
policy-driven volatil-
ity, the underperformers
would be high beta stocks
such as the technology
sector. The friction and
tension surrounding the
US-China trade war un-
certainty has dampened
the forecasted earnings
of technology companies
such as Apple who re-
cently revised their first
quarter earnings forecast.
This redection in profita-
bility has had its roots in
the trade disruption which
has had a direct impact on
the operating costs of the
company. The increased
trade risks and risk pre-
miums are reflected in the
equity prices of technolo-
gy stocks.
Nevertheless, the two
main economic indicators
of recessions – rising
unemployment and yield
curve inversion - are still
valuation in a Next Twelve
Month (NTM) outlook.
This stock pitch held true
in the Oct 18 stock sell-
off, during which there
was an equity self-off of
technology stocks, with
the tech heavy NASDAQ
benchmark having its
worst quarterly loss since
the 08-09 Global financial
Crisis.
I would like to talk
further about the highly
volatile Technology
sector. Let us use the
Tech-heavy NASDAQ
index as a benchmark to
measure the aggregated
performance for the Tech
sector.
Observing the
NASDAQ index, you will
see three major equity
sell-off periods – Feb,
October and December.
Comparing this with
the VIX index, you will
observe that the same
3 periods stood out as
periods of high volatility
and high market fear.
Overall, the
performance of the
Tech sector suffered,
particularly due to the
existing trade war between
the U.S. and China, where
tariffs have been enforced
on tech goods.
The February sell-off
originated from increasing
wage pressures (inflation),
where investors expected
the Fed to raise interest
rates. The fact that the
seemingly positive news
of rising wages would
be treated as bad news,
is a sign of a late-stage
bull market. Investors
began suspecting that
the financial conditions
would tighten and this led
to a harsh equity sell-off,
particularly for tech stocks
due to the commonly held
view that tech stocks are
overvalued.
The October Tech-
stock stemmed from the
Fed increasing its funds
rate (conversely interest
rates). Coupled with
lowered earnings due to
the trade war between
U.S. and China, where
operating profits of tech
companies took a hit.
Similarly, the Dec sell-off
stemmed from the rise in
Fed fund target rates. This
sell-off may have been
due a change in investor’s
views regarding the
conditions, investors are
vulnerable to fears of
an impending downturn
and often turn to equity
with a record of strong
performance in terms
of sustainable growth,
clean balance sheets and
good cash flows. One
sector which may meet
these conditions may be
the Telecomm sector.
Firstly, the Telecomm
sector has an increase in
growth potential due to
the 5G data plan which
Telecomm giants such
as AT&T and Verizons
are investing heavily
in. Beyond that, the
consistently high dividend
yields (5.5%) in 2018
attract investors who are
looking for stability and
sustainable returns amidst
increasingly chaotic
economic conditions.
In June 2018, I did
a stock pitch on AAPL
(Apple stock) during
which I proposed shorting
the AAPL stock due
to how overvalued it
was. Taking the results
from a Discounted
Cash Flow (DCF)
analysis and a Canonical
Correspondence Analysis
(CCA), along with the
lowered sales figure for
the latest iPhone and
iPad models, I concluded
that AAPL was likely to
underperform and drop in

Which sector will prevail in the current market?
U.S. economy (i.e. it has
reached a peak).
The 2019 outlook for
technologycompanystock
will likely be turbulent,
depending on which
part of the tech sector a
company is involved in.
The performance of tech
stocks will depend on
their innovation and their
ability to keep up with
investor’s expectations of
high earnings.
“Trade friction
has a direct
impact on
the operating
profits of
technology
company
[Apple]”
absent with the yield
curve remaining flat and
unemployment falling, it
is reasonable to assume
that the U.S. economy
will not, barring any
major eventualities go
into recession in 2019.
