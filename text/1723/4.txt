While this harmed the
cause of the reformists
in 1988, complete mar-
ket-pricing system was
still implemented. This
caused waves of cash
withdrawals, hoarding
and further economic
woes.
At the time, the country
was led by Hu Yaobang
a prominent reformist.
Hardliners, hating his
modernising attitude,
ousted him in January
1987.
When HuYaobang died
suddenly on 15th
April
1989, students came out
onto the streets celebrat-
ing him and his legacy.
They called for a return
of the liberalism that his
time as General Secretary
had represented and for
broader reform, including
more democratic rights
and investigations into
the corruption of Party
officials. Small gatherings
of students around the
Monument to the People’s
Heroes in Tiananmen
square spontaneously
started to form and grew
over the next couple of
days.
Hu’s state funeral was
held on 22nd
April. Over
100,000 students came
to Tiananmen square just
next to the Great Hall
where the funeral was
being held, despite orders
from the government not
to. The funeral was broad-
cast to students outside
and many felt it was
rushed and disrespectful.
Frustrated students started
a class strike and rioting
broke out round the
country.
After this, Deng
Xiaoping endorsed a firm
response and, on 26th
April, an editorial in the
party’s official newspaper,
entitled, “It is necessary
to take a clear-cut stand
against disturbances” was
published. Rather than

arly Western
explorers to
China returned
telling stories
about a land of silk, jade
and dragons. A whole
artistic movement was
birthed, Orientalism, that
imagined the East – in
particular China – as a
semi-real land more out of
story books than realism.
The ruling Communist
Party seems determined
to do the same thing in
modern China. However,
unlike the past, the party
wants to make its people
believe the myth as well.
A modern visitor to
China could be forgiven
for thinking that 4th
June
is no different from any
other day: the predictable
rush hour roar of people
heading to work or the
shops belies the immense
suppression of thought
that is going on online.
In the past, suppressing
ideas in a populace was
difficult for a government.
How, other than breaking
down doors and confis-
cating dissident material,
could you modify patterns
of thought? With the
advent of the internet,
the Chinese government
gained the ability to filter
a large proportion of
communication that goes
on between its citizens.
Crucially, however, this
is not done through heavy
handed laws preventing
assembly. Instead, words,
phrases and images can
simply be plucked out of
the information stream
and prevented from ever
bent over backwards to
accommodate the desires
and whims of the Com-
munist Party. Google, the
company whose informal
motto used to be “Don’t
be evil”, has quietly
dropped that commitment
and invested significant
time and money into de-
veloping a search engine
that conformed to Chinese
censorship standards.
China is currently
fighting an internal battle
against the will of its
own people. The events
of 1989 prove that the
desires for democracy
and accountability exist
and are powerful impulses
present in China that are
being supressed, rather
than simply a quirk of
Western life. The active
suppression of the
memory of Tiananmen
Square reveals a country
terrified of its own people
and its bloody past. Whilst
they have successfully su-
pressed the memory of the
last upspring of democrat-
ic will and pacified their
people with economic
bounty, the events of 4th
June 1989 will be repeated
until China acknowledges
its sins.
This week, we
remember the people that
died at Tiananmen square
in defiance of the govern-
ment
What Happened
In 1976, Mao Zedong
died, ending the Cultural
Revolution that killed
anywhere between
400,000 to 10 million
people. Spearheaded by
him as a way to rapidly
modernise China, it
resulted in widespread
poverty and economic
ruin.
Tentative efforts
through the 80’s were
only partially successful
and were exploited by
corrupt Party officials.
The effect of this
excising of history is
similar to the effect of
a stroke on a relative:
suddenly their behaviour
seems to make no sense.
They are scared of things
of no consequence, grow
angry without provoca-
tion and refuse to believe
that their view of the
world is wrong. They are
working off a different
set of memories and ex-
periences and processing
them differently to us. In a
situation like this, no one
in their right mind would
set aside everything that
they knew, remembered
reaching an audience.
The difference is akin to
that between a boulder
lobotomy and modern
neurosurgical techniques.
Nowadays information
regarding the Tiananmen
Square protests in 1989,
of which we are now
commemorating the 30th
anniversary, is almost
impossible to come by in
China. In previous years,
censorship has been so
fervent in erasing any sug-
gestion of the event, they
have prevented even the
word ‘today’ being used.
The effect of this on the
population has been col-
lective amnesia. Without
any information available,
children not alive at the
time have no awareness
of their history. Parents
choose not to teach their
children because it is too
complicated a burden to
place on them, and those
who were there live under
the Sword of Damocles
– always at risk of being
pulled off the street
and being disappeared.
Former student leaders,
such as Chai Ling, often
chose to flee the country
rather than risk imprison-
ment.
this is what we are at risk
of doing. Britain during
the Cameron years courted
China furiously, inviting
Xi Jinping to come and
dine with the Queen,
inviting Chinese compa-
nies to purchase stakes in
our nuclear power plants
and, in our particular
case, inviting ever more
students to come to study
in our universities. George
Osborne, at the time,
talked about the unique
connection that Britain
and China shared and
about the exciting future
projects we shall under-
take together. All this was
based on the assumption
that engaging with China
would encourage it to
become more western
in its outlook and more
liberal in the treatment
of its people. This has
proven to be false.
President Xi has not
moved to liberalise his
country. Instead, he has
doubled down, consolidat-
ing power and reaffirming
the repressive messages
of the past. Instead, we
in the West have moved
towards China in outlook.
Our companies have
“The difference
between
a boulder
lobotomy
and modern
neurosurgical
techniques”
and believed and join in
the delusions of the sick.
Unfortunately, I believe

C
a m p a i g n e r s
across the world
have brought the
issue of sexual
misconduct into the spot-
light in recent years and it
has become apparent that
itisaproblemeverywhere,
including at Imperial. In
an institutional culture
report about Imperial from
2016, researchers found
that: “Despite Imperial’s
‘no tolerance’ stance on
harassment and bullying
(…) women in particular
reported being silenced in
various ways.”
Imperial College
London is currently re-
viewing their policy for
how sexual misconduct is
dealt with in a designated
working group, after
having sought advice and
recommendations from an
external expert - a com-
mendable step. However,
there are no permanent
members of this working
group who are students
or sabbatical officers, and
this limits student input.
In November 2017
Felix brought an article
that, among other things,
highlighted that a person
had been found in breach
of Imperial’s sexual
misconduct policy but
was allowed to remain in
a position of responsibil-
ity within a society. The
Union’s policy has since
been changed (by us), with
>95% of Union Council
voting in favour of the
rule changes. However,
despite vigilant efforts,
it was only in January
2019 that the new by-law
clauses were finalised, 14
months after the issue was
initially raised. We must
find a solution to prevent
these delays.
We believe Imperial
should have a campaign
group dedicated entirely
to raising awareness and
ensuring that the student
voice is heard on this
important issue, while
making the path from
idea to action easier -
something that is clearly
needed.
That’s why we’re
starting PAARRY: Polit-
ical Action Against Rape
Required Yesterday. In
case you’re wondering
about the name, it’s a play
on words: parry is a term
from fencing which means
“to ward off an attack with
a countermove”.
We want to:
• Arrange events across
Imperial to decrease
prevalence and
increase awareness of
sexual misconduct on
campus.
• Ensure that the
College’s new disci-
plinary framework
has the students’ best
interest in mind, by
creating a forum for
students to discuss
it and collective-
ly campaign for
changes.
• Influence the adapta-
tion of the College’s
new framework into
the Union.
• Get involved in the
nation-wide debate.
In order for the idea
to become recognised
as an official Imperial
Campaign group we need
your support! if you agree

cowing the students, it
enraged them and protests
only grew larger. The next
day 50,000 – 100,000
students marched through
Beijing to Tiananmen
Square and received wide-
spread public support.
This march was
hugely successful and
the government’s tone
turned conciliatory. In a
speech, the government
called the movement
“patriotic”, negating the
message of the 26th
April
editorial. This pacified
many students who began
to lose interest.
In order to regain
momentum the student
leaders organised a hunger
strike. It was widely
popular and, by 13th
May,
there were 300,000 people
gathered in Tiananmen
Square. By 17th
May, over
a million Beijing residents
had demonstrated solidar-
ity with the protesters and
400 protests of various
sizes sprung up in other
cities. Foreign journalists
also began sending news
of the protests to the rest
of the world, causing the
leadership to worry about
how it looked abroad.
On 19th
May Deng
Xiaoping made the
decision that martial law
would be declared. By the
next day, 250,000 soldiers
were sent to the capital.
When they tried to enter
the suburbs they were sur-
rounded by crowds that
made any further advance
impossible. Demon-
strators climbed on the
vehicles and soldiers were
given food and shelter.
On 24th
May, the troops
were withdrawn to the
delight of the protesters.
However, across the
country, plans were being
drawn up for an assault.
By 3rd
June, plans were
finalised. While they
did not contain explicit
orders to shoot-to-kill,
At about 10:30pm,
the army was halted at
Muxidi where a bridge
had been blocked with
burning busses. 36 people
are confirmed to have died
here, though this number
is thought to be low.
Troops advanced
further into the city, firing
indiscriminately, killing
both demonstrators and
onlookers. Doctors that
went to treat the wounded
were also shot and killed.
Demonstrators tried to
form barricades, human
chains, negotiate or fight
back but, in each case,
they were pushed back
with armoured personnel
carriers running over bar-
ricades and demonstrators
and negotiators, such as
Duan Changlong, were
shot as they tried to reason
with troops.
Between 10:30pm and
midnight, news began to
trickle back to the dem-
onstrators in the square.
At this point, there were
between 70,000-80,000 in
the square.
By 2:00am, the square
was sealed off with
soldiers blocking all en-
trances and firing on any
reinforcements that were
attempting to enter the
square.
Despite the clear
threat to their lives, the
students didn’t renounce
non-violence. The leaders
of the movement even
confiscated sticks, rocks
and guns in an effort to
prevent further escalation.
At 04.30, after nego-
tiation between student
leaders and government
forces, the troops marched
up to within ten metres of
the students and set up
machine guns pointing at
the students.
There are reports of
troops firing into the
crowd, though this is
unconfirmed. What is
known is that, at 5:00 am,
students were allowed to
move out of the square
through a corridor opened
by the soldiers. Again,
though hotly disputed,
some have alleged that
these students, who
thought they had been
given a chance to live
walked into prepared
machine gun nests.
While this marked the
end of the main incident,
students walking near the
square later in the day
were shot at and killed and
an ambulance was caught
in the cross fire.
The next day, 5th
June
the famous photo of tanks
leaving Tiananmen square
being blocked by a man
carrying a shopping bag
was taken.
The death toll remains
controversial.TheChinese
Red Cross has estimated
that 2700 people died but
this number is contradict-
ed by a British diplomatic
cable, which has alleged
that the number was at
least 10,000.
“Troops were
told to‘use
any means
necessary’”
troops were told to “use
any means to clear im-
pediments” which was
interpreted as permission
by many units.
At 10pm on 4th
June,
troops moved into
Beijing. While they ini-
tially only fired into the
air, when soldiers came
up against barricades,
they turned their guns on
the demonstrators. Troops
used expanding dum-dum
bullets, so called because
they expand upon hitting
a body causing massive
internal trauma.
