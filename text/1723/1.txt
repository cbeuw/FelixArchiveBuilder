T
he other week,
when they had
the big marquee
on the lawn [for
Postgraduate Graduation],
one of my colleagues was
up here quite late and
two or three international
students were up here. My
colleague said, ‘there’s
nobody here, everyone’s
gone home’, and they
said, ‘I just want to take a
photograph of the door’;
they wanted to take a
photograph of the door
of the room where they’d
had counselling, with
the counsellor’s name
on the door, because the
counselling had got them
through.” This anecdote,
shared by Mark Collinson,
Imperial’s Senior Mental
Health Advisor, during
a recent discussion with
Felix about Student
Counselling & Mental
Health Advice, perfectly
illustrates the major issue
faced by the service this
year. “It was such a timely
picture”, Mark continued,
“because my response to
that was: to have a door,
we need a room.”
The Student Coun-
selling & Mental Health
Advice service, located
on the fourth floor of
the Sherfield Building,
is divided into two
branches: Student Coun-
selling - which is a student
self-referral service – and
the Student Mental Health
Advice Service, which
sees “students who the
staff refer”. Speaking
to Felix, Claire Fox, the
Acting Head of Student
Counselling & Mental
Health Advice explained
that “the strength is it’s
an embedded, integrated
service”. Last year, Felix
reported on the increasing
pressure faced by the
Student Counselling &
Mental Health Advice

service, due to the in-
creased student demand.
In response, in July
2018, the counselling
service received increased
funding. This was ac-
knowledged by Becky
Neil, Imperial College
Union’s Deputy President
(Welfare), who told Felix:
“Alice Gast [Imperial's
President] has just
put some money aside to
put into the mental health
strategy that the Director
of Student Services
Imperial's team of Mental Health First Aiders (MHFA), recognisable by their green lanyards (see above), also provide support by helping anyone
(staff or student) experiencing a mental health problem, before professional help is obtained. // Imperial College London
Despite increased funding for Student Counselling & Mental Health Advice, Imperial College's service has been stifled by
spacing issues
