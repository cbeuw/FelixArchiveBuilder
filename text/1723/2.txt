I told you I would do it
T
his week, I find
myself particu-
larly struggling
to write this.
I've finally run out of
things to say, not that
I've used these Edito-
rials to say anything of
profound note anyway.
I asked my sister for
advice and she said I
should write about the
fact that I'm approach-
ing the end of my tenure
- after this issue, I will
only have three left - and
how it is a bittersweet
moment. Although I am
in a reflective mood this
evening, I'm not yet at
the 'assessing my tenure'
level of self-reflection
yet (give it a couple
weeks!) Instead, I re-
membered a promise I
made at the start of the
year. I promised that
one day this Editorial
would almost entirely
consist of pull-quotes,
and there's nothing you
can do about it. Today
is that day. Desperate
times call for desperate
measures of course.
Before I do that, I will
jot down the little I do
have to say. This week's
issue of Felix features the
delayed follow-up to my
predecessor Fred's piece
on the Student Counsel-
ling & Mental Health
Advice service. I'm
currently still compiling
over 30 pages of notes,
research and transcribed
discussions with involved
staff and students into one
coherent two (and a bit)
page article so we'll see
how it turns out. To briefly
summarise the article,
although the service has
been allocated additional
funding, it is now faced
2
with an issue of spacing
and, as a result, has been
unable to increase the
resources available to stu-
dents in the last academic
year. This is a disappoint-
ing state of affairs but the
issue could soon be some-
what resolved and there
is hope to be found in the
recent developments.
The Augur Review of
tuition fees was released
earlier today and will have
the full Felix coverage in
next week's issue of the
paper, so be sure to look
out for that!

The grass on Queen's
Lawn has seen better days
// Imperial College Library
Patchy Queen's Lawn causes complaints
NEWS
Jason Murugesu

T
he grass on
Queen’s Lawn
has been suffer-
ing greatly due
to an excess of events
being held on the space,
resulting in student
complaints. In recent
months, it has hosted
the drinks reception for
Imperial’s Postgraduate
Graduation. Heavy rain-
fall has also caused the
grass to be waterlogged.
Ultimately the grass has
been left patchy and
complained to the univer-
sity’s Estates team about
the poor maintenance of
Queen’s Lawn, and told
Felix that the huge tents
had “ruined” the grass. He
complained that there was
“not enough space when
the sun comes out.”
Nic Dent, Acting Head
of Soft Services at Impe-
rial College London, told
Felix that the maintenance
of Queen’s Lawn has been
more difficult this year,
as the grass was already
in a poor condition due to
last summer’s heat-wave.
Dent is currently waiting
to find out how much it
would cost to improve the
lawn.

Unfortunately, the longer
period of hot weather
last year has made this
more of a challenge than
usual. The College will
be working to re-establish
the lawn and is currently

out the best method and

disruption the works may
have on staff and students.

Pablo Duran Millan, a
firstyearDesignEngineer-
ing student at Imperial,
told Felix: The Queen’s
Lawn is used to hold
events such as Graduation
receptions for students,
which has an impact on
the condition of the grass.
We appreciate that the
lawn is a valuable green
space on campus and
we make efforts where
It's funny that I've
managed to actually eke
out an almost complete
Editorial without yet
using a pull quote. I
would scrap everything I
put in the first paragraph
but (as the countless
spelling and grammatical
errors confirm) I have a
never look back policy
when it comes to writing
these. Anyway, Section
of the Week goes to
the Comment Section.
Shoutout to Copy Editor
extroadinaire, Calum
Drysdale, for making a tri-
umphant return to putting
his opinions on paper
instead of just spewing
them in the office.
