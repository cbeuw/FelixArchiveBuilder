UK tour of Tim Peake’s Spacecraft attracts 1.3 million
visitors
T
he Soyuz TMA-
19M spacecraft
carried Russian
commander Yuri
Malenchenko and US
and UK flight engineers
Tim Kopra and Tim
Peake to the International
Space Station (ISS) on
15 December 2015, and
returned the same crew
to Earth on 18 June 2016
(expeditions 46 and 47 to
the ISS).
Soyuz TMA-19M is the
first human-rated, flown
spacecraft in the Science
Museum Group Collec-
tion. The module weighs
approximately 1.5 tonnes
and its outer surfaces have
been charred by temper-
atures of around 1,500
degrees Celsius - experi-
enced during atmospheric
re-entry. It goes on
permanent display at the
Science Museum after at-
tracting 1.3 million people
while touring venues in
Bradford, Shildon, York,
Manchester, Edinburgh,
Peterborough, Cardiff and
Belfast, on the National
Tour of Tim Peake’s
Spacecraft presented by
Samsung and the Science
Museum Group.
Sir Ian Blatchford,
Director of the Science
Museum Group says:
“The tour of Tim Peake’s
spacecraft to museums
in all four corners of the
UK has been a testament
to the power of culture
to inspire. With Russian,
European and UK space
ingenuity all contributing
to the success of Tim’s
mission, the importance
of international collabora-
tion in achieving progress
for us all is more starkly
obvious than ever.”
As the world heralds
half a century since the
successful Apollo manned
moon landing, the Soyuz
has been joined on display
at the Science Museum
by the original Apollo 10
command module simula-
tor console; a key object
in NASA’s contribution
to the space race, and one
which has never been seen
in the UK before.
On long term loan
from the Smithsonian,
the control panel goes
on display alongside the
Apollo 10 command
module ‘Charlie Brown’,
which still holds the
record for the fastest
crewed vehicle in history
having reached 39,897
km/h during its return to
Earth on 26 May 1969.
The Apollo 10 mission
took astronauts Gene
Cernan, Tom Stafford and
John Young on two suc-
cessful orbits of the Moon
in a dress rehearsal for the
historic Apollo 11 Moon
“It’s wonderful how the
Science Museum Group
and Samsung have come
together through this tour
to extend the Principia
Mission’s impact in inspir-
ing the next generation of
scientists and engineers.”,
said ESA astronaut Tim
Peake. The emergency
space suit worn by Peake
during his descent to
Earth, the Sokol KV-2
space suit, joined the
Soyuz TMA-19M on tour,
and will go on long-term
display at the National
Space Centre, Leicester,
from this summer.
Also accompanying
the Soyuz TMA-19M
spacecraft on tour was
the Space Descent VR,
a stunning virtual reality
journey voiced by Tim
Peake himself, enabling
nearly 50,000 people to
experience in first-person
the high-speed descent to
Earth from the Interna-
tional Space Station.
The VR experience
was produced especially
for the Science Museum
Group and is powered by
the latest Samsung Gear
VR technology. It was
also incorporated into a
three-strand Education
Outreach Programme
developed by the Science
Museum Group and
Samsung, which reached
over 20,000 students. The
Education Programme
involved a combination
of in-school sessions
with the Science Museum
Group’s Explainer team,
special visits to see the
Soyuz, and a bus designed
to replicate the setting of
the International Space
Station with headsets
showing Space Descent
VR. The bus also visited
communities across the
UK, welcoming over
21,000 onboard.
The Space Descent VR
experience, and an oppor-
tunity to try on a replica
suit of Tim Peake’s Sokol
KV-2 space suit, will
be open to visitors this
summer at the Science
Museum.
The Science Museum
will be marking the 50th
anniversary of the lunar
landing with a dedicated
Summer of Space, includ-
ing the Museum’s biggest
ever sleepover: the Apollo
Astronights featuring a
lunar rover workshop and
other special activities.
IMAX screenings of
Apollo 11: First Steps,
which uses never before
seen footage that tells the
incredible story of the first
moon landing, will also be
part of the programme.
Other events include
a conversation on space
travel with Brian May
and Astronomer Royal
Lord Martin Rees, a
special preview of BBC
Two’s new docu-drama 8
Days: To the Moon and
Back and a screening of
Smithsonian’s Apollo’s
Moon Shot film, with a
live score by Teeth of the
Sea, introduced by former
NASA astronaut Wally
Funk.
Culture Secretary
Jeremy Wright has
expressed, “the record
number of people who
saw Tim Peake’s Soyuz
spacecraft highlights how
science and space travel
continue to inspire us. The
tour’s success underlines
why we make our world-
class culture accessible to
everyone in all corners of
the country”.
