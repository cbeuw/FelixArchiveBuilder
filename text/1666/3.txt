Atomic funding pours into Imperial
The nuclear sector has contributed £9.36 million Joanna Wormald
T
he Atomic Weapons
E s t a b l i s h m e n t
(AWE) has long
been responsible
for the UK’s
nuclear deterrence
programme. In addition
to providing the nuclear
warheads for each of the
Vanguard submarines that
make up Trident, the AWE
contributes significant amounts
to the coffers of Imperial.
Imperial is one of five British
universities to have a ‘Strategic
Alliance’ with the AWE and
as such is the beneficiary of
a five-year investment. How
beneficial is this exactly?
Between 2010 and 2012,
Imperial received £7.7million
— more than the other four
universities with Strategic
Alliancescombined,according
to figures in a report published
by the Nuclear Information
Service (NIS) and Medact,
a non-profit organisation
affiliated with International
Physicians for the Prevention
of Nuclear War. A Freedom
of Information request by
Nouse, the newspaper of the
University of York, reveals
exactly how much Imperial
has gained from this alliance
since that time.
Since 2012, Imperial has
received £9,358,488 from
the AWE — substantially more
than any other university that
responded to the FOI request.
Almost half of this amount has
gone to the Institute of Shock
Physics (ISP) and the Centre for
Inertial Fusion Studies (CIFS)
as “research expenditure”.
There is no mention of any
work on nuclear warheads
in research currently being
carried out by the ISP or CIFS.
So why invest in the College?
Although Imperial might
not be directly involved in
the development of nuclear
weapons, research carried
out here is still useful for the
AWE — specifically that of
the Plasma Physics Research
Group (members of which are
also involved in work by the
ISP). For example, a gas gun
installation jointly funded by
Imperial and the AWE allows
researchers to investigate
the behaviour of materials
under extreme pressures and
temperatures — the same sort
of conditions that are found
in the middle of a nuclear
explosion. Then there’s the
work on hydrodynamics,
which can be used to model
conditions and behaviour
inside a nuclear warhead.
Since the UK is prohibited
from testing nuclear weapons
(it has been a signatory of
the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty since 1996) all of this
is essential for the AWE to
be able to provide safe and
efficient nuclear deterrents.
In addition to spending
on research, the NIS report
found that between 2010
and March 2012, Imperial
received financial aid from the
AWE for consultancy work,
PhD scholarships, contracts,
courses, publications,
conferences and staff support.
Aside from this funding,
there are also non-pecuniary
advantages to be gained on
both sides. The partnership
between the ISP and AWE
provides a “two-way transfer
of technical expertise and
equipment”. The AWE
provides training for students
and academics and interacts
with ISP collaborators to foster
a “network of knowledge and
technology”. In return, the
AWE benefits from being able
to access expertly-trained
individuals, being able to
conduct research in the public
domain, and publishing joint
research papers in peer-
reviewed journals. It is not
unreasonable to conclude
that the alliance also allows
the AWE to scope out
potential future employees;
of all the FOI requests made
by Nouse, Imperial was the
only respondent to explicitly
promote employment
opportunities at the AWE by
hosting career events and
displaying relevant marketing
materials.
AWE priorities are clearly
focussed on the continuous
maintenance of current
nuclear warheads and the
development of a successor
system. The AWE also
supports the Non-Proliferation
Treaty, though it is not obvious
what form this support takes
beyond the tight security
measures in place to prevent
non-nuclear states getting
hold of sensitive information.
Away from the military sector,
the AWE is part of the national
emergency response when
nuclear accidents occur in
the UK. According to the ISP
webpage, working with the
AWE allows the public to
enjoy safer manufacturing
methods, stronger vehicles
(both civilian and military
grade), better protection
against acts of terrorism and
natural disasters, and more
reliable satellites.
The research carried out
at Imperial in conjunction
with the AWE has plenty of
potential benefits. Work on
the effect of explosions on
human tissues could be useful
in treating blast injuries for
instance. There is, however, a
less cheerful prospect. The NIS
report highlights the potential
‘dual use applications’ of
university research — i.e.
the ability to use the results
of research for “military
purposes contributing to the
development of weapons
of mass destruction”. For
Imperial, this could mean
the weaponisation of studies
involving wave propagation
or shock processes. When
dealing with sensitive areas
of research, projects are
referred to the Research
Ethics Committee, though
the NIS report could not find
clear evidence of how the
Committee makes decisions
as to whether research should
go ahead or what guidance it
provides for handling sensitive
topics.
This is by no means the
first time Imperial has
worked closely with military
organisations and looking
at the financials gains to be
made, it is unlikely to be the
last (Imperial has previously
worked in association with
the Ministry of Defence,
Department of Trade and
Industry and QinetiQ,
a multinational defence
company, on guided weapons
technology). If it is to continue
with these partnerships and
alliances, Imperial needs to
be more transparent about
where its funding is directed
and what impact its research
may have. When approached
by felix on the subject of
Research and Consultancy an
Imperial spokesperson said
“that is subject to a security
classification above Official
Sensitive [and] is not permitted
to be undertaken by College
staff on any College campus.
“Relevant Imperial
Departments flag employment
opportunities at AWE to
students as part of the
College’s efforts to promote a
broad range of career
paths“
