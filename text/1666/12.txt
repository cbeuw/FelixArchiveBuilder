S
ince the surprise
of 7th
May 2015,
the NHS has fallen
into its darkest
times since its
inception. As a
medical student, seeing my
colleagues here and across
the whole medical profession
has, frankly, made becoming
a doctor look the least
appealing it’s looked since 14
year-old me decided it was
the route I was going to take.
And I’m not alone in thinking
this: since 2014, applications
for medical school have been
in constant decline. The most
recentfiguresreleasedshowed
that (from UK applicants) the
number of students applying
in 2016 compared to 2014
had fallen roughly 13.5%,
with one of our fellow London
medical schools, St George’s,
offering clearing places for
the last two years running.
However, it goes beyond
just the beginning of training.
The staffing crisis has only
been exacerbated by the
Conservatives. With the
infamous Junior Doctor
contract imposition, the
number of Junior Doctors
choosing to stay with the NHS
after their foundation training
(the first two years after
graduating) fell to record lows
in 2015 to just 52% (down
from 71.3% just six years ago).
And it doesn’t stop with
doctors, I don’t have enough
words to go into detail, but
a simple ‘nurses food banks’,
‘nurse’s strike’, ‘below inflation
pay rise’ (for it’s sixth year
running) in your chosen
internet search engine will
give you a sense of the gravity
of this NHS-wide crisis.
I’ll obviously be prioritising
the NHS on June 8th
, but I
strongly urge everyone do the
same. The NHS brought you
into this world, it’s what’ll see
you out, and it will be there
for every broken bone, mental
health problem, and ailment,
no matter how large or small,
in between. Even without
the statistics and endless
Terrestrial TV documentaries,
it’s plain to see the NHS is at a
breaking point, and you don’t
need to dust for fingerprints to
see who’s to blame.
Personally, I’ll be voting
Labour. In Hammersmith
they’re the only hope we
have against a Conservative
gain (with only a 6.8% swing
needed for such an outcome).
But while this is the case, what
I think is best for our NHS is
stopping the Tories. Thus I’m
taking the typical millennial-
F a c e b o o k - s p a m m i n g
approach of promoting
tactical voting.
Honestly? I’m not sure who
would handle the NHS best
anymore. The Blair years
saw waiting times slashed
and resource availability
skyrocket, but also saw A&E
and maternity services closed
in around 60 local hospitals.
The Lib Dems’ plans look
promising but we all know
how easy they are to bend
on promises. The only thing I
can say for sure is as a future
health care professional, me
voting Tory is like a turkey
voting for Christmas.
Whoever you are, you will need the NHS at somepoint \\ NHS

oft on security,
denying the deficit,
and incapable
of addressing
concerns over
i m m i g r a t i o n .
These sound like the sort of
accusations the Conservatives
levelled at the last Labour
government not too long
ago, and yet, after seven
years in government, these
are all areas in which the
Conservative party have
failed by their own metrics.
To anyone who even vaguely
follows politics, the election on
the 8th
of June seems to be a
forgone conclusion. Of course
Theresa May will win in a
landslide. Of course Labour
are going to haemorrhage
seats. But should this really be
the case?
Consider Brexit, currently
being pursued with reckless
abandonbytheConservatives.
It seems they’re keen not only
to close the door on Europe,
but throw away the key. Not
only are they threatening
to withdraw us from the EU
without an agreement, which
could be extremely damaging
to our economy but they’re
pulling us out of European
organisations we don’t even
we champion at Imperial:
values we hold not out of
sentiment, but because we
know fruitful results are borne
out of cooperation. For all
their lines about left-wingers
and the economy, here the
Conservatives are clearly
putting populism ahead of
economic credibility.
Consider that national debt
is the highest it’s been in fifty
years, the NHS is extremely
vulnerable and underfunded,
and that doctors (doctors for
Christ’s sake!) have taken to
the streets against Jeremy
Hunt, who nonetheless
has retained his position.
Consider that the Education
Maintenance Allowance has
been scrapped, fees are set
to rise indefinitely, that local
government funding (which
covers things like libraries,
housing and adult social care)
has been slashed. Consider
that the party of small
government and national
security has passed legislation
specifically to invade your
privacy and cut tens of
thousands of police jobs.
Recall the repeated failures
to reduce immigration and
control spending. Non-EU
migration alone, which can be
controlledbyUKgovernments,
exceeded the promised total
amount. They’ve failed to
keep their promises regarding
the deficit, assuring us it would
be eliminated by 2015, then
2017, then 2020 and now
2025. Whether you think
these promises were sensible
isn’t important here: they
were made, and it is therefore
entirely fair to criticise the
government for failing to keep
them.
Consider their own
manifesto, which included a
policy that would strip you
down to your last £100,000
of assets after death, an
extremely regressive form of
inheritance tax, should you
require care while suffering
with a degenerative disease
(dubbed the “dementia tax”).
Theresa may have half-
heartedly backed down on
this – the first time a party has
broken a manifesto pledge
before an election – but she’s
made clear a similar policy
might yet survive and don’t
forget, the Conservatives
thought this would be a
sensible idea in the first place.
Labour have put forward
a more optimistic manifesto.
Unlike that of the Conservative
party, it was fully costed at the
point of publication. People
can disagree about the
specifics, but all the numbers
are out there. In stark contrast
with the Conservatives, Labour
have pledged to restore the
EMA, abolish tuition fees,
recruit 10,000 police officers,
invest£250bnininfrastructure,
renationalise rail and mail to
improve efficiency and lower
consumer costs and undertake
Brexit in a responsible manner
that puts the economy first.
For this, Jeremy Corbyn’s
party is being painted as
radical, but why? None of
them are out of step with the
rest of Europe, and indeed
many (abolishing tuition fees,
renationalising Royal Mail)
are merely a restoration
to the balance that existed
under that great socialist
Margaret Thatcher. On the
economic front, the Tories
and tabloid press tell us that
the Labour party cannot be
trusted, and indeed they must
be on shaky ground if their
underlying ideas are only
endorsed by two recent Nobel
Prize winners and a diverse
group of other high profile
academics (who cares about
experts these days, anyway?).
Those of you worried that,
for example, taxes on the
wealthy might drive them
abroad should note that the
Conservatives are a) driving
junior doctors abroad at a
time when the NHS is short-
staffed and b) pursuing a hard
Brexit which might be a lot
more damaging to business
than a few extra pennies of
tax on the most successful. The
small income tax increases
suggested are very much
in step with our European
neighbours, and the suggested
corporation tax would still be
lower than that of most major
European countries and the
United States of America.
Throughout this campaign,
the Conservatives have chosen
to focus on personality instead
of policy, pitting the “strong
and stable” Theresa May
against Corbyn’s “coalition of
chaos,” but the British people,
and certainly those of you at
Imperial, should be intelligent
enough to see through that.
Ideas have to come first
– if you don’t believe me,
ask yourself where David
Cameron is right now. Even
engaging with their argument
about leadership reveals their
weaknesses: a strong leader
wouldn’t refuse to debate
their opponents, hide from the
public at carefully managed
events, or abandon any policy
that meets the slightest hint of
resistance.
Trusting the alternative to
the establishment is never
easy, but ask yourself if, in
the face of all the evidence
presented here, you can
support the Conservative
party in good conscience.
Rather than voting for a party
that’s hinted it’ll bring back
fox hunting and doesn’t seem
to have education, healthcare
or international cooperation
high on its list of priorities,
vote to challenge Theresa
May’s vision on Brexit. Vote
to challenge the notion
that we need to build walls
between ourselves and the
rest of the world. Vote for a
more inclusive, tolerant, and
optimistic society. Vote Labour
on the 8th
of June.

Ain’t no party like a Parliamentary Labour Party \\ twcuddleston
have to leave, such as the
European Atomic Energy
Community. This is just one
case where the Tory line on
Brexit is not only hurting our
country’s research capacity,
which is crucial to Imperial,
but attacking the sort of “red
tape” that keeps people
safe (forgive me, but I don’t
have faith in a Conservative
government regulating
pollution in the air and sea,
leave alone nuclear power
plants). A Tory “Hard Brexit”
is at odds with the values
of diversity and openness
