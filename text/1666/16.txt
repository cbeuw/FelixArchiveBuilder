SEX
The near-peg experience
The ultimate feminist sexual act and a culture’s fear and obsession with butt stuff
I
went home last week for
a few days over the bank
holiday. As always when
I go home, I opened up
Tinder and began to
swipe. I mostly use it as
a way to keep track of who
from school is single, but
sometimes use it to shark on
hot students and locals.
I swiped right on a few
people before I ran out of
candidates (it’s a very small
town). Being the very fussy
Tinderer that I am, I only
had two matches: Ben* and
Adam*. Shortly, Adam mes-
saged me.
“Wanna peg me?”
It was a charming message
that really appealed to me.
Such a careful message, so
considerate of my profile,
acknowledging that I was a
woman with a brain as well
as fantastic good looks. I was
already enamoured with this
Adam, but best to play it cool.
In my classic girl-on-Tinder
way, I didn’t reply.
Having drinks with my best
friend the next evening, I
showed her the message.
“Oh my God,” she said.
“You have to do it!” Instead
of being put off by the for-
wardness of the message, she
thought I should be keen.
Sure, I was curious. Pegging
has always been something
that I’ve wanted to do, but
finding a man willing to let
me peg them has proven
nearly impossible. Pegging
was the only thing that my
last boyfriend decreed as
a hard no, an attitude that
seems to be all too common
among men that I bang. And
so here someone was offering
me the holy grail of sexual
acts, a fucking black swan of
an opportunity. The chance
was being presented to me to
get this pegging experience
under my belt so that we
could all move on, no strings
attached.
And so I replied.
“Do you have the
apparatus?”
He did. We established
more details on the situation.
He lived a five minute walk
away (really, a very small
town), wasn’t a local (so
hopefully the small town thing
wouldn’t be a problem), and
was willing to let me, a total
pegging noob, fuck him in the
arse with a strap-on dildo. I
mean really, what could go
wrong?
Well, it turns out, I could.
Plagued with one of the
worst coughs of my adult
life, I knew there was no way
I would be able to pound
someone’s ass without collaps-
ing into a hacking, choking
mess on the floor. I needed to
stall a couple of days.
So under the pretence of
wanting to see if he was a
serial killer, I asked him more
about himself. Striking the
balance between feigning an
interest and really wanting
nothing more from this man
than to, as he so delicately
phrased it, make him my
bitch, let me tell you, is chal-
lenging. Honestly, I’m not sure
I got it quite right. Maybe I
used too many puns. Is there
such a thing as too many
puns? It wasn’t a complete
boner-killer, but I can’t say it
didn’t put a bit of a dampener
on things.
Regardless, we agreed
to meet the next night. The
evening came around, and
with rare warning before
I have sex, I went to the
effort to shave my legs and
everything. I was feeling
empowered; this was going
to be the night that I lost my
pegging virginity, and really
it was going to be a metaphor
for my whole life as I finally
got to assert my dominance
over a man.
As the time ticked closer,
he stopped replying to my
messages. What had been
rapid-fire enthusiastic flirting
became silence, and with our
arranged time impending, he
tragically unmatched me on
Tinder.
My pegging dreams came
crashing down around me.
Disappointment aside –
what struck me most about
this experience, beyond the
fact that poor Adam was
clearly kink-shaming himself
for his desires to be pegged,
was that my female friends
were so taken by this idea –
some went home to discuss
it with their boyfriends, so
enthusiastic they were about
the idea. What is it about
pegging that strikes the imagi-
nation of so many women, yet
strikes fear into so many men?
There are plenty of men –
straight, gay, or anything in
between – out there who love
to be pegged. Whether it’s
the change in power dynamic
or the stimulation of the
prostate, once you get a taste
of it, you’re bound to go back
for more. A new experience
can create greater intimacy –
if you’re already in a sexual
relationship – and switching
up sexual habits can really
stimulate the appetite.
But for a lot of men,
whether it’s internalised
homophobia, fear for their
precious buttholes, or not
wanting to relinquish power
to the weaker sex, it’s a total
no-go. Pegging is the ultimate
feminist sex act: to make a
man the receptive partner,
whether it’s in a submissive or
dominant sense, in our world
that worships the phallus,
putting on an artificial penis
inevitably causes a shift in
power.
So women, don’t be afraid
to ask if you want to take
control over a man, and men,
open up your minds and anal
sphincters to the idea of being
pegged. It might turn your
world upside down.
P.S. Sorry this is all so het-
eronormative but you know
what, this peg-o-phobia is
really only a straight person
problem, queers have got it
down.

protect the privacy of these
