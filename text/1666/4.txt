Party candidates come to Imperial
A
hustings of local
parliamentary
c a n d i d a t e s
was held
yesterday in
Blackett which
saw Victoria Borwick
(Conservatives), Cllr Alan
De’Ath (Labour), Bridget
Fox (LibDems), Richard
Braine (UKIP), and finally Bill
Cashmore (Green), engaging
in a debate on Education,
Public Health and Brexit.
Borwick, has served on
the Science and Technology
Committee in the House of
Commons and chaired the
Health and Public Services
committee at the GLA. She is
committed to supporting The-
resa May’s strong and stable
leadership to secure the local
economy in the future.
De’Ath is focussed on human
rights, in particular those for
LGBT+ people and women
suffering domestic violence.
Fox is firmly against a hard
Brexit and has accused Con-
servatives and Labour alike
of failing to listen to Remain
voters. She has promised to
fight for liberal values and
stand up for civil liberties.
Finally Cashmore owns
a business with an annual
turnover of £2 million per
annum, thinks there’s need for
a second EU referendum and
promises hope, creativity and
persistence.
Braine is one of the more
seemingly sane UKIP can-
didates. His website and
campaign leaflets offer accu-
sations of a “fake Brexit plot”
and mentions a “LibLabCon
surrender-cartel”... wut? His
priorities include cutting immi-
gration, funding the NHS with
money taken from the Foreign
Aid Budget, and helping immi-
grants to integrate.
Students and locals joined
for a chance to grill the keen
politicians on matters close to
their heart. Before entering
the space, attendees were
given the chance to submit
questions to the organisers.
The panel was chaired
by Union President Nas
Andriopoulos who promised
he’d stay apolitical. Opening
statements were well received
(Yes, even Braine’s which
included the characterisa-
tion of judeo-christianity as
mankind’s greatest engine
for prosperity, and even Bor-
wick’s who insisted she cared
about North Kensington
despite it being outside her
constituency) and generally
reflected parties’ general
views. As the discussion
progressed though the
mood shifted. The discontent
and frustration in the room
became palpable as Braine’s
consistently inflammatory
remarks started being met
with jeering, Borwick was
heavily criticised by fellow
panellists and audience
members alike, and even Fox
took a hit when an audience
member accused the LibDems
of betraying ‘The People’ who
had loudly voted Leave.
Generally responses
mirrored party manifestos,
and demonstrated which
parties and candidates had
done their homework. The
discussion kicked off with
education with De’Ath and
Cashmore being proponents
of tuition fee abolishment.
On the other side of the
spectrum Borwick maintained
the system works perfectly
fine and fairly (though she
admitted interest rates could
do with some adjustment),
claiming that more students
from disadvantaged back-
grounds have been going to
uni than ever before (though
that might be because there’s
more of them). Somewhere
in the middle Fox didn’t
explicitly say what her
stance on fee scrapping is
though she did imply tuition
fees are a necessary evil,
and instead LibDems were
dead-set on doing something
about student maintenance
costs. Also somewhere in the
middle Braine echoed UKIP’s
infamous stance of scrapping
tuition fees but only for STEM
subjects, causing an outburst
from English Literature gradu-
ate Cashmore.
Questions on education
from the floor were mostly
centred around concerns for
the funding of STEM. How
would parties fund STEM and
Research and Development
(R&D) without international
students or tuition fees?
The only serious response
came from Labour who have
pledged spending 3% of
the GDP on R&D. Braine’s
response was reallocating
the Foreign Aid Budget and
Borwick went on a tangent
talking about her visit at
CERN.
Next came the NHS and its
privatisation. Fox started by
reinforcing her commitment
to a universal NHS. She did
however distinguish between
hardware and clinical ser-
vices, claiming she’s open to
privatisation of the former.
Borwick returned to the
favoured party message of
no money, no honey. A strong
economy is necessary for
proper investment in health
services. The Conservatives
have already provided
£10 billion to the NHS, she
claimed, and would release
an extra £8 billion over the
next parliament (though if
you have kept up with anal-
yses of the manifestos, you
will be aware that this money
will actually come from cuts
in other sectors). Skirting
around the controversial
Conservative social care
policies, she merely said that
social care and health care
should be integrated and
care should come first when
it comes to a growing and
ageing population.
UKIP promises to put
another £6 billion into the
NHS again from the magical
Foreign Aid Budget. They’ll
also bring in some 35,000
GPs and nurses (though
it’s unclear if there will be
any willing takers of these
positions).
The Greens promised even
more – £20 billion – from
scrapping Trident (which
Cashmore says is pointless
and costs £3.6 billion per
annum) and Financial Trans-
action taxes.
Finally, De’Ath attacked the
Tories’ “appalling” record. He
highlighted the 24,000 nurs-
ing vacancies and criticised
the uncosted Conservative
manifesto. Borwick returned
fire, criticising the unsuccess-
ful PFI scheme under the
Labour government (even
though the idea was first
implemented by John Major’s
government). She claimed
it was easy for the other
candidates to make promises
but the Conservatives had
presided over an increase in
doctors, operations and care.
Question once again started
coming in from the floor, with
audience members chastising
the current government for
health cuts, hospital closures
and the recent ‘Dementia tax’
plans.
Fox started by calling out
the irony in the conservatives
who have presented non-
costed manifestos criticising
the costed manifestos of their
opposition. She acknowl-
edged that current LibDem
plans would not bring UK
healthcare spending in line
with the EU average but that
it was “a step in the right
direction”.
De’Ath and Cashmore
also jumped on the
offensive criticising the gov-
ernment for health cuts and
short-sightedness.
On the defence, Borwick
returned to the idea of social
care, this time mentioning
the manifesto promise that
people would be left with at
least £100,000 after paying
for their social care and made
a vague reference to the
successful rolling out of pilot
schemes.
Last came the issue of Brexit
which was always going to be
important given that 33-40%
of Imperial students aren’t
British. The question specifi-
cally referred to what each
party would do to guarantee
the rights of EU students.
Borwick and Braine both
maintained that contrary to
“tabloid drivel” internation-
als in the UK did not seem
worried.
Cashmore quickly came to
the offence citing the feelings
of fear and discomfort many
non-UK nationals were
feeling.
In another dig at the Tories,
De’Ath proclaimed that
Borwick had just won the
“Theresa May award for not
answering the question”. His
answer was simple: the rights
of all nationals would be
guaranteed. Fox also agreed
that guaranteeing the rights
of nationals was the right
thing to do. She also stressed
the importance of making
ordinary internationals feel
at home, not just the Chelsea
elite. In response Borwick
asked “Why are you saying
that all plumbers must be
Europeans?” despite nobody
having asked that question.
At that point the discussion
lost focus and quickly moved
on to Environment.
Unfortunately there were
only five minutes left to
discuss environmental policy
which gave candidates a
thirty second window to air
their green views. Unsurpris-
ingly everyone’s main focus
was London’s appalling air
pollution. Notably Borwick
and Braine did not mention
climate change, with the
UKIP candidate additionally
going into a tangent about a
German diesel conspiracy.
That concluded the event
which was surprisingly civil
and an overall success.
Now go vote.
