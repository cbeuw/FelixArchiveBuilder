could have a major impact
on Imperial). All EU nationals
living in Britain will have their
existing rights guaranteed with
the hope that the EU will pro-
vide the same for all 1.2 million
UK citizens living in Europe.
But what about students? In
2015, Ed Miliband vowed to
reduce tuition fees to £6,000
a year. This time Labour have
gone further and will abolish
tuition fees altogether (includ-
ing those who start university
this autumn) and reintro-
duce maintenance grants.
Another welcome move is the
exclusion of students from
immigration numbers (which
the Lib Dems promise too)
and to ensure Britain remains
part of the Erasmus student
exchange scheme after it
leaves the European Union.
Corbyn and Labour have
also found an unlikely ally
in the form of the UK Grime
scene with #grime4corbyn
being used by some of the
UK’s biggest and best MCs
to show their support. If
nothing else, Jeremy’s got a
new career to fall back on if
it goes awry on June 8th. A
Jme/JC collaboration has got
Mercury Music prize written
all over it.
Fun Fact: Largest manifesto, I know because Diane Abbott told me. Prediction: Second largest party, possibly enough to form a Lab/Lib/everyone else coalition.
LiberalDemocrats|TimFarron
T
he Liberal
Democrats know
there is a less than
small chance of them
becoming the largest
party, and are
campaigning instead to
become the main opposition
party. Their key manifesto
pledges revolve around them
holding the Conservatives to
account on issues such as the
NHS, education, and most
prominently, the EU.
The Lib Dems have pledged
to have a second referendum,
this time not on whether to
leave the EU or not, but on the
deal that the government has
got at the end of it all. With
regards to EU negotiation,
the Lib Dems are fighting to
retain membership of the
single market and the customs
union and want the rights of
EU citizens in the UK to be
maintained (naturally with the
converse happening too).
Economic policy wise, a ‘1p
in the pound’ on income tax
will raise £6bn for NHS and
social care services. The IFS
predict that this rise in income
tax would bring in more money
than Labour plans, and in a
more forecastable manner,
but would affect the top half
of households rather than the
top 2% that Labour would
target. This NHS spending will
also accompany a £100bn
package of additional
infrastructure investment
on various
p r o j e c t s ,
(300,000 more
homes, £7bn
into education,
£300m to
p o l i c i n g )
along with
championing
both the ‘Northern
Powerhouse’ and ‘Midlands
Engine’ (yes, the latter is now
a real thing too).
Another stalwart of Lib Dem
policy, and one which features
again this time round, is the
legalisation of Cannabis. The
party want to bring in a legal
market for the currently Class
B drug, cutting
down the load
on police forces
as well as
increasing the
tax revenue (as
seen in some
US states).
Reinsta ting
university maintenance grants
for the poorest students, as
well as bringing back student
nurse bursaries, is also in the
manifesto but they’ve steered
well clear of any promises
on reducing tuition fees. WE
HAVEN’T FORGOTTEN,
NICK.
Aside from policies, there’s
alsotheirpledgetorefrainfrom
forming a coalition with any
other party. This is something
that caused them to lose great
swathes of their 2010 voters
after they compromised some
of their key policies while in
power with the Tories from
2010 to 2015. Whether
leader, Tim Farron U-turns on
this in order to get some of his
key manifesto points enacted,
remains to be seen.
Fun Fact: Tim Farron is up against ‘Mr Fish Finger’ in his constituency. Seriously. Prediction: Around the same as last time, 10 MPs-ish.
Greens |CarolineLucas&JonathanBartley
T
he Green Party
are the party that
are pushing the
most towards a
utopian society
with their manifesto,
championing animal rights,
environmentalism, and a
united Europe (in the form of
the EU).
The Greens, similar to the
Lib Dems, want a second
referendum on the terms of the
Brexit deal with the EU and
another final choice of staying
in the union (we might actually
have to leave and rejoin, it’s
all a bit unclear as we’re the
first).
One big shakeup would be
enacting a four-day working
week, a policy which the
manifesto tackles in half a
bullet point. All I want to know
is what day they’re actually
going to turn into a weekend,
Fridays currently feel more
like weekends but everyone
loves a good Bank Holiday
Monday. It’s a toughie. Other
changes to the working world
include the banning of zero-
hours contracts and steps
towards a universal basic
income as well as a minimum
wage of £10 by 2020.
Students may be glad to hear
of their proposed tuition fees
scrapping, and fully funded
student grants, bold promises
but ones which you shouldn’t
bank on. Students looking for
work in the oil/gas/nuclear
energy sectors will be less
happy though, as the Greens
aim to replace these entirely
with renewables.
The environment is at the
heart of the agenda too, with
a keystone of it all being an
‘Environmental Protection Act’
to restore and safeguard the
environment. Although this is
a bit vague in the manifesto,
there are plenty of policies
which detail things from
cancelling airport expansions
to increasing protections on
environmental zones (Green
Belts, National Parks etc.).
In complete opposition to
UKIP (as most of their policies
are) is the increase of the
overseas aid budget from
0.7% to 1% of the GDP.
All in all the Greens face an
uphill struggle to be a viable
force in Westminster as the
current voting system doesn’t
work in their favour at all. They
only gained one MP in 2015
(one of the two co-leaders of
the Party, Caroline Lucas) and
likely won’t gain a whole lot
more.
Criticism has been drawn
over the lack of concrete
figures in the manifesto but
this may be due to the brief
planning period that the snap
election has caused. Imagine
you only had three hours to
complete your lab report,
you’d be a bit hazy on all the
figures too. And remember,
as their arch nemesis UKIP
showed, you don’t actually
need MPs to start a revolution,
you just need public support.
Fun Fact: Shortest of the manifestos (26 pages). Very environmentally friendly. Prediction: Likely just the one MP, the flaw of FPTP.

Manifestobreakdowns|Thepolicyheadlines
The following pages break down the main party manifestos and summarise a few
key policies. This is by no means a full and in-depth analysis of each party. Mainly
because the manifestos are long and complex, and it’s exam season. [Insert tinfoil
hat theory that the timing of the election coincides with the time when young voters
are away from their constituencies/too busy to fully engage]
These should be brief guides, and the manifestos themselves should be consulted
before you vote (or at least the impartial and bullet-pointed BBC synopses of them).
Another good resource is uk.isidewith.com, a website which asks your opinion on
policy points and, within a degree of error, gives you an idea of who best fits your
views. Aside from all this, the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) is an impartial body
who have looked into the main party manifestos and given their verdict of the eco-
nomics behind it all, well worth a look too. Also visit yourvotematters.co.uk to find
your local candidates as well as theyworkforyou.com to see how the incumbent
has performed.
Whatever you do, don’t let felix be your sole source of political information (or
any other publication/party website for that matter), you need to be fully informed
when you cast your vote (or spoil your ballot) on June 8th
.
Conservatives |TheresaMay
T
he Conservative
party started this
election campaign
with the sole intent
to claim a larger
majority and
strengthen their position when
it came to negotiating the
future of Britain after Brexit.
When the snap election was
called by Theresa May back
in April it seemed a full-
blown conclusion that a large
Conservative majority was
inevitable, but that lead in
the polls (of around 24%) has
begun to slide in recent weeks.
Just how confident was May
of winning a majority? Well
she announced her support
for the return of fox hunting
last month, a policy that 78%
of the public disagreed with.
Whatever your feelings on the
matter, to back a policy that
less than a fifth of the public
agree with was a ballsy move.
The issue of the moment,
Brexit, is one which the Con-
servatives aim to facilitate as
smoothly as possible, lead-
ing to a “strong
and stable
economy”. The
manifesto sets
out plans to
leave the single
market and the
customs union
with the EU,
whilst seeking a
“deep and spe-
cial relationship”
with it. It almost sounds roman-
tic. Almost.
With this exit from EU, the UK
will be able to pursue trade
deals more openly with the
wider world. May believes that
this is now the way forward,
despite backing the Remain
campaign.
The NHS is a non-Brexit
topic that is discussed by all
parties, with the Conservatives
pledging £8bn
extra fund-
ing. The Tories
have chosen
to tackle the
rising costs of
social care by
i n t rod uc i ng
a plan which
alters how
much people
pay towards
their own care. These plans
will raise the current threshold
at which people start paying,
from £23,250 to £100,000,
but the exemptions that meant
(usually) houses wouldn’t count
as assets could be scrapped.
These rules will also now apply
if you get care in your home
(for illnesses such as dementia,
hence why it’s been nicknamed
the ‘dementia tax’). This means
more people could be forced
to sell off their home to pay
for their care, albeit not while
they’re living. These care costs
seemingly had no limit in the
manifesto, until May U-turned
and said that there would be a
cap on lifetime care costs. No
concrete figure has yet to be
put on that limit though.
The economy also features
heavily in the manifesto, with
the ever recurring pledge to
‘balance the books’ (make
sure government spending =
government revenue) which
will now not occur until 2025.
Plans to raise personal tax
allowances to £12,500 and
cut corporation taxes to 17%
will be maintained from the last
general election. Basically ‘we
promised to do this by 2020
and we’ll keep going towards
that’. Increases in VAT have
also been ruled out, fantastic
news, as I can barely work out
20% of prices as it is, let alone
some other decimal value.
If you’re hoping to see May
discuss these policies directly
with the other party leaders
then you’ll be sadly disap-
pointed, she chose to ‘meet
voters’ directly up and down
the country rather than debate
with the other leaders on TV.
Amber Rudd, current home
secretary, did however take
her place in the BBC debate
on Wednesday.
Fun Fact: In the manifesto, ‘strong’ appears 86 times and ‘stable’ a mere 20 times. Prediction: Around enough MPs to form a majority, could go either way though.
Labour|JeremyCorbyn
A
t the start of
the General
E l e c t i o n
c a m p a i g n
with 24 points
b e t w e e n
the two major parties in the
polls, a massive Conservative
landslide on the 8th
of June
looked all but inevitable. It was
meant to be an election about
leadership of the “strong and
stable” kind, not one fought
on policy. But the popularity
of Labour’s manifesto and
key promises has surprised
many. They have offered a
manifesto, which while large
swathes of the press might
label as extreme, is in tune
with a large proportion of the
population.
The slogan “for the many, not
the few” is at the core of many
of the document’s proposals.
The party have promised to
increase income tax for the top
5% of earners, or those earn-
ing over £80,000, with new a
new 45p rate as well as a 50p
tax rate on all money earned
over £123,000. An arguably
more extreme measure is the
increase of corporation tax
from 19% to 26% – Labour say
that this will raise up to £19.4
billion a year – but others warn
that companies will move busi-
ness away from the UK as a
result (especially in an uncer-
tain post-Brexit climate).
The most transformative
measures in the manifesto look
at bringing back many private
services into public ownership.
Railways will be run by the
government when franchises
expire (at a cost of nothing to
the taxpayer) and a fare cap
will be introduced. The mani-
festo also includes the promise
of at least one publicly-owned
energy company in every
region of the UK, a return to
public control of the national
grid, and a ban on fracking.
Britain’s unions will be very
happy with Labour’s manifesto
as it includes the creation of a
Ministry of Labour to enforce
workers rights as well as the
repeal of the Trade Union Act.
Unpaid internships and zero-
hours contracts will be banned.
And workers will finally be
paid a Living Wage with the
Minimum Wage rising to at
least £10 by 2020.
On Brexit, the manifesto
outlines what the party hopes
to achieve in talks with the
EU. Single market and cus-
toms union benefits are to be
retained as well as membership
of many R&D groups (which
