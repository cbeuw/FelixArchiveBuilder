UKIP, the right wing
mainstream party, are present
in the fray as more of an
ideology than an actual force
in Westminster, with their
12.7% of votes eventually
leaving them with no MPs.
This doesn’t mean they aren’t
important though; they ran on
a platform to get out of the
EU in 2015 and because they
got so many votes, they were
able to force David Cameron
into holding a referendum
(because Dave was scared
of losing some of his MPs to
UKIP). Long story short, they
accomplished one of their
main policies, and brought
about a massive change to the
UK, while having fewer MPs
than the Lib Dems. Currently
they’re led by Paul Nuttall
but Nigel Farage, their ale-
drinking, cigarette-smoking,
EU-hating figurehead is never
too far from the picture.
This is because at the end of
the day you are voting for a
local representative, albeit
one who’ll be somewhat tied
to a national agenda, and
they may have particular
policies or beliefs that either
align or clash with your own
views.
And what’s the likely
outcome?
Honestly, it’s getting less and
less clear by the minute. When
the election was called by May
in April, some polls had her as
far ahead as 24% over Labour
but as May (the month) went
past, May (the Prime Minister)
and the Conservatives had
their lead cut (despite local
election losses for Labour) and
now June may be a disaster
for May (the Prime Minister).
This has been largely in part
due to a surge from Labour
rather than a demise for
the Tories – although May’s
‘U-turn’ on social care and
how it would be funded didn’t
help them. Local elections
have also thrown an extra
indication of the mood of the
country into the mix, with them
occurring just a month before
the general election, not
halfway through a parliament
like normal.
Local-level governance is
very different to the roles that
MPs have and often votes
are cast with local issues
in mind, but general trends
are probably not too far
off the pace. Essentially the
Conservatives did well, Lib
Dems did okay, Labour did
poorly (although this is still
a moving picture), and UKIP
were annihilated (this doesn’t
do their losses justice).
Any hopes for a Labour
win on June 8th
looked to
be further diminished, as a
party that was going to make
a surge would most likely
have made gains rather than
losses like they did. However,
turnout is always lower for
these local elections and the
demographic of who votes is
different (not all parts of the
country vote too).
As of going to press though,
the Conservative party will
likely be the largest party but
won’t have gained the massive
majority that they were hoping
to achieve. This all depends on
how good an indication the
local elections were, whether
the current Labour surge in
popularity continues, and
whether the ‘shy Tory effect’
comes into play. And besides,
if we’ve learnt anything
recently, the polls are always
wrong anyway.
Turn to the end of the pull-out
to see how Imperial students
are planning to vote in our
reasonably scientific poll.
What to look out for on
June 8th
Voting opens at 7am
on Thursday June 8th
and
continues until 10pm the
same day, but the general
rule of thumb is that if you’re
in the queue by 10pm you’ll
be eligible to vote (don’t use
me as your lawyer in court
though). During the day
there’ll actually be a weird lull
in the election HYPE as once
the polls are open, all the
news can report is that “voting
is underway” as they aren’t
allowed to influence voting
one bit.
As soon as the clock strikes
10pm then all hell breaks loose
as the ‘Exit polls’ are released.
These are opinion polls
conducted as people leave the
voting booths and are roughly
a representation of the results
ahead. As the voting closes

BBC’s coverage. Be prepared
for his sleep-deprived sass
when spin doctors try and spin
the unspinnable. BBC, ITV,
Sky News, and Channel 4 all
have coverage of some sort,
the BBC is usually the more
serious and formal outlet with
all the big names and Channel
4 have Jeremy Paxman, David
Mitchell, and Gogglebox for
a bit more of a light-hearted
take. The BBC also includes
Jeremy Vine in his virtual
reality hell (you’ll know it
when you see it) and the stats
guru Professor John Curtice,
the only man who can keep on
top of literally every vote and
what it means. Flick between
all four channels during the
eight-plus hours of coverage
for best effect.
By morning, a pretty clear
picture should have emerged
and later in the day, if a
majority party is present, a
government will be formed
(provided The Queen lets
them). If there’s no clear
winner, that’s when the ‘fun’
begins. Parties will have to
try and form a coalition (very
hard after the Conservative/
Lib Dem coalition in 2010
didn’t go swimmingly) and if
that fails we’ll either end up
with a minority government,
which will find it hard to pass
laws and bills, or we might
end up with another election.
And nobody – and I stress,
nobody – wants that.
Regardless of your politics
and regardless of whether
you’re voting in a safe seat or
not, go out and vote. Take the
little bit of time out of your day
to exercise your democratic
right, and even if you don’t
vote for a particular party, just
spoil your ballot in a hilarious
way.

The Green Party represent
the opposite end of politics to
UKIP, being the party which
mixes environmentalist and
left-wing economics with a
dollop of progressive politics.
Jointly led by Jonathan Bartley
and Caroline Lucas (their only
MP), they are often amongst
the top-four parties vote-wise,
but due to the electoral system
they find it hard to win seats.
The largest regional parties,
the Scottish National Party
(SNP) and Plaid Cymru,
represent Scottish and Welsh
interests respectively. The SNP
does considerably better out
of the two and has amassed
56 MPs as opposed to Plaid’s
three.

Here we go again...
D
ing ding ding,
it’s election time
again. No, you
haven’t woken
up from that nap
in 2020, they’ve
called an early election. Do
you have no idea who you’re
voting for? Well, you’re in luck
my friend, because we’ve got
a whole pull-out complete
with manifesto breakdowns,
and personal views on who
fellow students are voting for.
But before all that, let’s have
a look at the overall state of
affairs.
What’s happening?
On June 8th
a general
election is being held to
determine the makeup of the
United Kingdom Parliament,
in particular the political party
(or parties) that form Her
Majesty’s Government (yeah,
the Queen still runs it all, on
paper).
“But didn’t the Fixed Term
Parliament Act get passed
which meant general elections
would be held every five
years (2015, 2020, 2025
etc.)?” I hear you cry – well
yes, kinda. While this is still a
law, there’s a loophole in the
act which means that if two
thirds of MPs vote for an early
election, an early election is
called. But why did the Prime
Minister, Theresa May, call an
early election, and why did
the other parties support her?
May decided to try and
capitalise on her high in the
polls in order to increase the
number of seats her party
has, and in turn make passing
decisions through parliament
easier. May could’ve held out
until the end of the fixed term
but with Brexit ever present
she likely couldn’t see what
the political landscape would
be like in three years time – I
guess she didn’t have 2020
vision. The other parties voted
for this early election because
they had to; if they wanted to
put themselves in power the
only way they could do that
would be by an election. Even
if they knew they were going
to lose, if they didn’t even
try then they’d look weak
(and certainly not strong and
stable).
So how does the UK
political system work?
The whole of the UK
(England, Wales, Scotland,
and Northern Ireland) is
split into 650 constituencies
who each vote for a single
Member of Parliament (MP)
to represent them in the
House of Commons. The vote
in each constituency takes
place via a ‘First Past The
Post’ system, whoever gets the
most votes wins. This system is
criticised as it can lead to vast
misrepresentations of how the
UK as a whole voted in the
number of seats awarded to
parties. For instance, UKIP
garnered 12.7% of the total
votes cast but only ended
up with one MP in the 2015
election (until that MP left the
party), roughly 0.2% of the
number of seats in House of
Commons. The opposite has
also been seen with the SNP,
they achieved 4.7% of the
vote but gained 8.6% of the
seats.
Whetheryou’refororagainst
the policies of these parties, it’s
not an accurate representation
of the electorate’s views and
changes to the voting system
are constantly advocated.
Changing this system to a
(sorta) proportional one was
put to a referendum in 2011,
but it was a bit of a farce and
it never got close to passing.
Further changes to the
system were to be enacted by
the 2020 election, the number
of MPs was to be dropped to
600 and the boundaries were
to be redrawn so that each
constituency had roughly the
same number of people in it
(something which currently
varies wildly) but these
changes obviously didn’t take
place in time.
Another quirk of the
system is that there’s a slight
difference in what an actual
majority is. A majority, when
it comes to votes in the House
of Commons, actually means
needing slightly less than 325
MPs (half of 650). This is due
to some MPs not voting, either
by choice or by design.
Sinn Fein MPs from Northern
Ireland choose not to take
up their place in Parliament
as their core belief is for a
united Ireland, one which
isn’t overseen by a British
government. The Speaker and
Deputy Speakers of the House
(the ones who you see shouting
ORRRRRRDDDDERRR) are
only allowed to vote in a
tie, and even then they have
to vote a certain way. This
is because even though the
Speakers are elected MPs they
have to renounce all political
stances once they take these
roles to remain impartial,
which sucks if you live in their
constituency as you lose your
elected representative.
So who are the main
parties?
The current party in charge
is the Conservative party
(nicknamed the Tory party),
led by Theresa May. May
inherited the position by virtue
of being the only one left in
the Conservative leadership
election, and is aiming to lead
her party to an even larger
majority of MPs than the one
she currently commands.
Aiming to spoil her party’s
party is Jeremy Corbyn,
Labour party and opposition
leader. The Labour party
are the ‘opposition’ party
as they got the second most
seats and votes behind the
Conservatives. Broadly
speaking Labour are left-
leaning on the political
spectrum and the Tories are
right-leaning. These positions
are then dragged further
toward or from the centre
depending on the political
climate, the leader of the
party, and the issue that’s
being discussed.
The Liberal Democrats are
somewhat in the mix too,
collecting 7.9% of the votes
in 2015 but getting only eight
MPs. This is a huge step down
from their 2010 result due to
the backlash from the coalition
that they entered into with
the Tories, which is univerally
believed to have been a bad
move for the LibDems. Their
position as the minority party
in the coalition deal meant that
they really didn’t have much
sway and had to backtrack on
some key 2010 policies which
clashed with the Conservative
stances *cough* tuition fees
*cough*. They’ve switched
leaders since then, from Nick
Clegg to Tim Farron, but the
north remembers.
