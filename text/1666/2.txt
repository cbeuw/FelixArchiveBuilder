F
un fact: we originally had big plans for
issue 1666. We were gonna do a ‘pagan
issue’ dedicated to religion, with a graphic
illustration of the Devil splashed across the
front cover. But then in April May announced
a snap general election and we were like
‘God damn’. We forfeited the pagan issue for a
GE2017 issue, because if we don’t get political who is?
There’s only a week left until the general elections.
If you haven’t given up all hope and aren’t just tired
of being made to exercise your democratic right, well
you’re gonna love this issue. We’re talking idiot’s guide
and manifesto analyses, we’re talking comment and
NHS, we’re talking Imperial poll results, we’re talking
bingo. Seriously, you’re in for a treat.
And even if you’re sick and tired of democracy,
maybe flicking through issue 1666 will motivate yo ass
to roll off the sofa and down to the polling station and
cast your vote.
Us younger voters are often perceived as
complacent, indifferent, resigned (often all three).
These are the attributes that seem to be summoned by
our disappointed forefathers to explain the low voting
rates amongst their offspring in recent years. Yet this
latest general election has acted like a call to arms. On
the 22nd
of May, the last possible day for registration,
almost a quarter of a million under-25s registered.
Now, just over a week later and a week before the
8th
of June, the latest YouGov poll is predicting a hung
parliament – a parliament wherein no single party has
achieved majority – which would be an unexpected
blow to May and the Conservative party.
The poll has come under scrutiny, as YouGov
employed a new questionable methodology to arrive
to these results, but the reality is that until the very last
vote has been cast and accounted for, everything is
up in the air.
Regardless of my political beliefs, I want to say that
it doesn’t matter whether you’ll vote Conservative,
Labour, LibDem, Green, Ukip or Women’s Equality
Party. It might not even matter whether you decide to
vote at all (despite the centrefold urging you to). As
long as you read up and make an educated decision.
As long as you make your voice heard. As long as
you’re not just giving up your rights.
So read up and above all, enjoy.
