T
he Old Vic's
Woyzeck is a
retelling of a play
left unfinished by
playwright George
Büchner at the time
of his death in 1837. In this
version, the setting is moved
to Berlin in 1981, before
the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The titular character, Frank
Woyzeck, is a young British
soldier stationed in Berlin,
struggling to provide a home
for his girlfriend, Marie, and
their child. As they aren’t
married they cannot live in
the barracks, but Woyzeck’s
meagre salary can barely
afford their tiny apartment.
Desperate for money,
Woyzeck agrees to take part
in a mysterious clinical trial
of an unknown drug. Here
begins his descent from a
struggling young man into
desperation, delusion and,
eventually, insanity.
The story retains many
of the elements of Büch-
ner’s original – Woyzeck is
struggling with poverty and
insecurity, and is manipu-
lated by people in power: his
sleazy army captain engages
him in menial tasks, whilst the
mysterious doctor engages
him in the trial without any
information. However, this
adaptation heaps additional
trauma into Woyzeck’s past.
We are told he was aban-
doned by his mother, later

only to be forced to watch
his mother have sex with
a customer. He has been
plagued by rejection from
potential foster parents and
deemed to be ‘difficult’. The
play also makes allusions to
an ‘episode’ during a pre-
vious assignment in Belfast,
that leads to Woyzeck being
shunned by many of the other
soldiers. These additions are
somewhat excessive. Büchner
intended the original to depict
the struggles of the working
class – Woyzeck’s troubles
are results of financial pres-
sure and abuse by those in
power. However, the multiple
tragedies almost remove this
message. This Woyzeck is so
troubled that what happens to
him seems almost inevitable.
The change in setting to
1980s Berlin adds little to
the story. There are some
attempts to connect the
divided Berlin to what is hap-
pening to Woyzeck. However,
these references carry no
weight and the attempt itself
seems disingenuous. This is a
real pity as everything else
really comes together. The
staging is immersive, with
the use of shifting walls that
add depth to every scene.
Moments where Woyzeck
rips into the walls to reveal
blood and flesh are powerful,
especially as those walls
remain on stage, forming an
increasingly bloodstained
backdrop.
The real strength of this
adaptation is the cast. John
Boyega (of Star Wars fame)
is truly compelling as the
titular Woyzeck. He captures
a delicate vulnerability that
makes Woyzeck an endear-
ing character and ensures the
audience is undoubtedly on
his side. As Woyzeck begins
to fall apart, Boyega keeps
the audience invested in his
emotional journey and, in the
final scenes, brings an almost
surreal intensity to the role
as Woyzeck’s life collapses
around him. There are strong
performances from the rest
of the main cast, including
Sarah Greene as Marie and
Ben Batt as a fellow soldier,
although it’s clear that
Boyega is the star of the show.
All in all, the strong produc-
tion and cast are somewhat
let down by the story.
Woyzeck contains so many
compelling elements, but
the overly tragic backstories
pull the audience out of the
narrative.
