L
ast season, when
Emma Rice was
appointed artistic
director, the Globe
seemed to set a new
course. Her tenure
would mean the company
would no longer be focused
simply on conservation of
Shakespeare but on mutation
and adaptation of the
classic texts for a modern
audience. Yet, this, only
her second season, is also
Rice’s swansong – she will
be stepping down in a few
months, and if her adaptation
of Twelfth Night is any
indication, she is making it
count.
In Rice’s production we’re
transported to a parallel
1970s, a world in which
Shakespeare’s verses are cut
with disco anthems, glitter,
bright lights, and enthusiastic
dancing. Twelfth Night, for all
its fun is a text shot through
with melancholy. These
subtler, darker emotions get
lost in Rice’s production; what
it lacks in nuance it more
than makes up for in sheer
entertainment. The audience
packed into benches and
standing in front of the stage
were buoyed by the dazzle
and spectacle of the produc-
tion, which more than once
felt like a raucous panto; able
to capture wonderment and
joy in equal measure.
A lot of things happen in
Twelfth Night: after a ship-
wreck, the twins Viola and
Sebastian are separated; the
heroine Viola finds herself
washed up in Illyria, a far-off
country that Rice imagines
as a seventies Scotland. In
Illyria, Viola disguises herself
as a man, Cesario, placing
herself in the service of Duke
Orsino who is trying to win
the favour of the wealthy
Countess Olivia. Viola as
Cesario goes to woo Olivia
on behalf of the Duke but
finds that she has become
the object of Olivia’s affec-
tion whilst she herself has
fallen in love with the Duke.
Meanwhile, Olivia’s steward
Malvolio, is tricked by others
in Olivia’s household into
thinking Olivia has fallen in
love with him, and proceeds
to act so inappropriately that
he’s carted off to solitary
confinement. Things come to
a head when Sebastian, not
dead after all, also washes up
on Illyria and is mistaken for
Cesario.
It can be a challenge for the
cast to effectively convey to
an audience who may not all
be familiar with the plot. In
particular, Olivia’s fool, Feste,
can be a tricky character to
translate in most productions.
Here, he has been trans-
formed into something of a
one-man Greek chorus: Le
Gateau Chocolat, drag act
extraordinaire, holds court
onstage, baritone soaring.
John Pfumojena as Sebastian
and Anita-Joy Uwajeh as
Viola are both assuredly char-
ismatic, Uwajeh, who has the
meatier role, is particularly
so. It is however, Katy Owen
as the uptight steward Mal-
volio, who steals the show.
Owen is afforded plenty of
opportunity to show off her
comedic chops, her physical
comedy in particular, is pitch
perfect, teetering always on
the edge of the truly ridicu-
lous. In the latter scenes when
Malvolio comes to realise
that he has been tricked,
Owen really shines, letting
the veneer of his control and
self-possession fracture to
reveal his needy vulnerability.
Owen chooses to play the
role straight, giving no hint
in the performance that she
is a woman playing a man.
Twelfth Night is a story of
subversion, and rightly, Emma
Rice has put reinvention of
interpretation and diversity of
cast at the centre of her vision
for the play. In many ways,
this was the play everyone
had been looking forward to
from her, Rice has consistently
pushed at the boundaries
accepted at the Globe.
She’s drawn her fair share
of criticism for her produc-
tions as well as admiration.
I was offered something of
a window into the former
last week when I was seated
next to a rather elderly white
gentleman for the perfor-
mance. It was clear from the
outset, he was not going to
be a fan. He sat stony faced
as the magnificent Le Gateau
Chocolat, resplendent in
gold, belted out the opening
song. Magnanimously, I
gave him the benefit of the
doubt – drag acts can be

a shock to the uninitiated,
perhaps he’d warm to the
performance. But it was
already too late: by the time
he’d composed his face into a
rictus grimace of 'tolerance',
Tony Jayawardena, and then
in quick succession, Theo St.
Claire, Kandaka Moore, and
Nandi Bhebhe were on stage
in their kilts. This simply was
not on - he’d come to see
Shakespeare, who were these
brown-skinned interlopers?
“Black and Scotch?!” he
muttered, incredulous, as if
the thought that anyone with
skin darker than the colour
of weak tea might ever wear
tartan had never occurred
to him (clearly, he was not
a fan of chef extraordinaire
Tony Singh). He waited a few
more moments, presumably to
determine whether this really
was happening in front his
own eyes, when the cast did
not turn any fairer, he gath-
ered up his jacket and left, all
before ten minutes were up.
This worked out excellently
for me and the reviewer next
to me, we shuffled into the
space he’d vacated, and
proceeded to enjoy the show,
view no longer impended by
a pillar.
Nothing quite brings up
identity politics in theatre
like Shakespeare. Though
originally devised as enter-
tainment for the masses,
these stories are often seen
as the preserve of the elite,
his fierce progressivism is
forgotten behind the fug of
outdated language. Who gets
to tell these stories, and who
consumes them? Rice’s answer
is that muscular adaptation
of the text and inclusivity are
the best ways to maintain
the Shakespearean legacy,
in her tenure she confronted
the Globe’s establishment,
pushed at the accepted
boundaries in much the
same way that Viola’s arrival
shakes up the puritanical soci-
ety in Illyria. Not all of Rice’s
experimentation has hit the
mark, but at least she tried,
and it is a great shame she
will no longer be afforded the
opportunity to explore some
more.
