This week you take
a page out of Theresa
May’s book and
refuse to show up at
your exam. Unlike
Theresa May you fail.

This week you
spend a fiver on an
overpriced ‘farmer’s
market’ burger. Three
months later you’ve
starved to death;
unable to eat shitty
library cafe food but
also unable to afford
posh nosh.
This week you’re
News Editor Matt
Johnston and you’ve
singlehandedly made
a pullout. You emerge
from the felix office
pale, hungry, and
dehydrated. It was the
worst of times. It was
the blurst of times.
This week je suis
covfefe.
This week you’re that
one audience member
at the BBC GE2017
debate who claps
when everyone else
boos and jeers at Paul
Nuttall. You don’t even
know who this guy is
you just like standing
out.
This week in a freak
accident you fracture
your right wrist. Now
you finally understand
what a long distance
relationship feels like.
This week you get drunk
and talk your tattoo-gun
owning friend (also drunk)
into tattooing ‘inperial4lyf’
on your chest. You’re trash.
This week you decide
that unlike Paul Nuttall
you’re gonna flip-flop.
You haven’t told your
Labour friends but
you’re now a Tory.
This week you win
Union colours. You
wish they’d given you
a Nandos voucher
instead.
This week you
discover a packet
of discontinued
McDonald’s Szechuan
sauce in your dad’s
sock drawer. You
refrain from asking
burning questions and
put it up on eBay.
This week you’re studying
in the library when you
see someone naked in
a red kimono looking at
you from the Chemistry
building across the road.
You’ve been working too
hard. Or have you?
This week you decide
to drop out of Imperial
and follow your
dream of becoming
an international drag
superstar. Sadly your
Marie Curie drag
doesn’t prove a success
and you end up in
investment banking.

CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I am writing to you on this monumental occasion because
for the first time in my life I think maybe, I am about to decide
that it could be a good idea to potentially vote if I’m not
otherwise inclined.
See I’m 25 and though I’ve been able to vote for quite some
time I haven’t. Not entirely sure why, though my therapist has
hinted that maybe, it could be in part the suspected indeci-
sion that some people have suggested plagues me and the
subsequent pathological need I perhaps have sometimes felt,
of keeping as many options as possible open.
So yeah, I might be voting. Or not. But if I do, who should I
vote for?
Best,
Justine Mabe (but you can call me Tina. Or Joy. Or Jodie)
Honey,
I totally feel ya. I struggle with decision
making as much as the next person. This
morning for example I was debating whether
I was going to have chocolate or banana
weetabix minis for about an hour. In the end I
just barged into my housemate’s bedroom and
berated her for a good quarter of an hour
for not making better cereal choices. I mean
where are the Coco Pops, the Crunchy Nut,
the selection of exotic muesli?
Needless to say that by the time I was done it
was lunchtime and I just ended up reheating
some leftover Sunday roast and having that
instead.
Anyway you get it, I’m indecisive AF. I
remember last time I had to vote, at the EU
referendum, I spent the day prior on my
HOROSCOPES
bedroom floor in foetal position, with my
thumb in my mouth doing breathing exercises.
When I finally made it to the polling station, I
spent probably a good 30 minutes staring at
my ballot. My palms were so clammy, when I
finally made up my mind I had to get another
ballot because my first one was soaked and
had basically disintegrated in my hands.
The EU referendum however was a tremen-
dously valuable experience that really helped
me make decisions more confidently and act
a bit more impulsively. Despite me personally
voting Remain, the UK still voted Brexit.
So go vote and don’t overthink it, ‘cos if the
universe is dead set on fucking you over there’s
nothing you can do to prevent it.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
