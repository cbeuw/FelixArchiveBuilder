WhyI’mvotingConservative
A
nyone who
thinks that this
election is not
about Brexit,
is out of touch
with the reality
of the task ahead. Brexit will be
looked upon as a turning point
in this country’s relationship
with its neighbours. Some
argued that this was the worst
political choice this country has
ever made. For a long time, I
was one of those people. I
found economic security in
the status quo and certainty in
the confines of a dysfunctional
EU. However, the way Britain
has been treated after Brexit
by the EU highlights the
divergences in the core of the
European project. For Europe,
the EU was an emotional
peace project after WWII and
the end of the cold war. For
Britain, it was all about trade
and never about giving up
sovereignty. In the light of this
disturbing EU tone, we must
forge new trade agreements to
secure our future. This country
was always a merchant
trading country. We need to
be where the buyers are and it
is not Corbyn who is going to
deliver these trade deals.
Therefore, the upcoming
snap general election
constitutes a larger threat to
the welfare of this country. The
outcome will not only dictate
what kind of future we get
after the negotiations, but also
define what sort of country we
for nothing. We’d be tied down
to trade deals with the slowest
growing block of nations in the
world, unable to sign any with
India, the US and China. The
British people would also have
to accept continued freedom
of movement of EU nationals.
This sort of political speech
might displease a large part
of the readership of this
newspaper. After all, Corbyn
is offering a manifesto that
promises a lot to students
including scrapping tuition
fees. But Britain cannot
afford his social economic
programme.
This election offers a real
settlement Theresa May gets
will become law.
In contrast, a Labour
government would certainly
include an SNP alliance,
guaranteeing a second
Scottish referendum and
effectively breaking up this
country. This portrays a weak
and divided Britain.
Theresa May has made
her strategy clear and her
party has supported her.
Commandeering a large
majority will give her a
mandate to walk away
from Europe if the Eurocrats
want to punish this country.
Meanwhile, Corbyn lacks
any political nous, leaving
us exposed to a European
project that wants increased
federal rapprochement. He
is adamant on a Brexit deal,
stating that no deal “is not a
viable option”. This increases
EU leverage, raising the final
‘divorce bill’ beyond £60
bn. Theresa May could very
well walk away and leave
the EU with a massive hole
in its budget. Here lies the
difference: she is ready to go
to extreme extents to secure a
gooddeal.Hewillcompromise
to what’s on offer.
The EU’s attempts to
interfere in this election
through the Downing street
dinner leaks just show the
This is guaranteed with a
Labour implemented 26%
corporate tax, up from the
17% promised under the
Conservatives. Multinational
businesses are already
considering relocation, this will
be the final nail in the coffin.
Failure to keep businesses will
make us look desperate for
a deal and that is the wrong
approach.
This country has achieved
so much since the 1970’s. Ask
your grandparents what that
era was like, union strikes,
unemployment. A vote for
Corbyn is a vote to return to
a bygone era of socialist folly.
Theresa May offers something
more familiar, a more British
Britain, rather than a divided
one. It is now my firm opinion
that a hung parliament will be
the most catastrophic political
and economic decision of
our generation. The rise and
fall of this country is on the
ballot box and I am voting
for pragmatism over blinding
socialist idealism.

The only way of making a
disaster of Brexit would be
electing Corbyn. He will most
certainly compromise with
the EU and sign an EEA type
of agreement, like the one
Norway has in place.

choice and two radically
different visions of Britain. The
Corbyn choice is to renege
the economic achievements
of the post-Thatcher era, and
build a country based on the
most socialist manifesto ever
proposedwhilesimultaneously
negotiating Brexit – something
he will never be able to do.
Brexit will be a big enough
transition and will require a
united team with front bench
political experience. I simply
fail to see this successfully
happening with a Labour
party with tumultuous divisions
on both Brexit and the Corbyn
leadership.
Theresa May can deliver
the best outcome of what is a
difficult situation. She needs
the strong mandate, a 400+
MP landslide that would offer
her flexibility to displease
Eurosceptic MPs. This will be
key when parliament votes
on the negotiation outcome.
Delaying the next general
election from 2020 originally
to 2022 guarantees that the
survival instinct that EU
leaders have exhibited. They
want to prevent any future
exits and set a disturbing EU
precedent. They want a weak
Labour government, one weak
on Brexit, as Britain must not
thrive outside the EU.

UKIP|PaulNuttall
U
KIP, the United
K i n g d o m
Independence
Party, to give it its
full name, has for
the last decade
or so been essentially Nigel
Farage and friends. He was
the leader that led the party to
the fulfilment of their primary
goal, for the UK to leave
the European Union, before
(eventually) handing over
the reins of the party to Paul
Nuttall. The manifesto this time
around focusses on making
sure the government, whoever
that may be, is pressured into
a full and swift cutting of ties
with Brussels.
This comes in the form of
leaving as soon as possible
(2019), paying none of the
‘divorce bill’ from the EU (for
our “share of the financing of
all the obligations undertaken
while it was a member”), and
quitting pretty much all of the
EU initiatives and unions (the
jurisdiction of the European
Court of Justice, the EU single
market, and customs union).
Oh, they also want “full
maritime sovereignty” too.
Rule Britannia, Britannia rules
the waves, and all that.
Migration, or lack thereof,
is also a pillar of UKIP policy
and they pledge to cut net
migration to zero i.e. one
in, one out. This is in tandem
with unskilled and low-skilled
migrant labour being banned
for five years, with skilled
workers and students needing
visas to work/study in the
UK. There is also a pledge to
restore university maintenance
grants but also one to end
student loans for EU nationals
after Brexit.
Foreign aid is also to be
slashed and funnelled into the
struggling NHS, contributing
to an extra £11bn for NHS
and social care combined.
Headlines have also
been drawn to their policy
surrounding the ban on
wearing a burqa or niqab in
public. As an addendum to
their views surrounding the
barrier to communication and
the risk to security UKIP feel
the garments pose, they are
also concerned at the lack of
Vitamin D that wearers may
be getting from decreased
exposure to sunlight. The
burqa and niqab masks
people’s faces, much like the
Vitamin D excuse masks UKIP’s
true intentions. No news yet on
whether their sympathies also
extend to those of us stuck in
the library revising all day.
And just when you think we’d
had enough of them, UKIP
also pledge to hold a public
referendum on something
(literally anything) every two
years based on public opinion.
Fun Fact: The manifesto namedrops U2 frontman, Bono. Prediction: Their vote share will tumble and they will likely have no MPs. Poor Paul.
SNP|NicolaSturgeon
T
he Scottish National
Party (SNP) rose to
prominence in 2015
after they swept 56
out of the 59 seats in
Scotland, solidifying
themselves as the voice of
Scotland in Westminster.
Chunks of SNP policy, as
is the same with Plaid Cymru,
focusses on topics which are
‘devolved’ and aren’t voted on
in Westminster. Despite that,
the manifesto does actually
lay out how the SNP would
vote in some cases (essentially
they’d vote as they would if the
matter involved Scotland).
The keystone of SNP policy
has been the fight for Scottish
Independence, a case
which they fought for in the
independence referendum
(#indyref) back in 2014. After
Brexit they now want a second
referendum (#indyref2).
Sturgeon and the SNP were
originally planning to have
this referendum before Spring
2019 but it’s now been pushed
to sometime after the final
Brexit negotiations go through.
With regards to Brexit, the
SNP want to protect Scotland’s
place in the EU single market
as well as actually getting
the Scottish Government
(themselves) a place at the
Brexit negotiations.
Similar policies to Labour
pop up here and there in the
manifesto, including a £10
minimum wage, no increase in
National Insurance/VAT, and
triple lock on pensions.
Another point of note is
that it’s the deputy leader,
Angus Robertson, who
would represent the party in
Westminster. This is because
Sturgeon is the Scottish
First Minister and that job
comes with its own Georgian
townhouse. I’d probably send
my deputy to Westminster too.
Fun Fact: Scotland or Scottish is mentioned 515 times in the manifesto. Predicted Seats: Scotland’s largest party by far, they’ll probably lose a seat or two.
PlaidCymru|LeanneWood
A
gain, due to
d evo l u t i o n,
Plaid isn’t
really up
against the
bulk of the
main party policies. The
devolved Party manifestos
are so removed from the
‘Westminster’ policies that
the Llafur Cymru (Welsh
Labour) manifesto doesn’t
once mention Jeremy Corbyn.
Some parts of Welsh life
are inevitably governed by
Westminster but the Wales-
specific policies can make all
the difference when casting
your vote.
Wales is set to be one of
the areas hardest hit by the
loss of EU money, and one of
Plaid’s key policies is ensuring
that Westminster promise to
replace every penny. Plaid are
also promising to guarantee
rights for all Europeans
currently in Wales, and aim
to secure a strong Brexit deal
for Welsh agriculture and
industry.
£7.5 bn would also go
towards infrastructure
investments in hospitals,
railways, schools, roads,
and housing, as well as vast
investments in health, social
care, and policing. They would
introduce an independently
verified living wage and
living pension, and invest
significantly in education at all
stages, including increasing
the availability of Welsh
language education.
The manifesto promises a
new Welsh legal jurisdiction
and human rights charter.
They pledge investments in
renewables and a new Climate
Change Act, and promise
to fight to scrap Trident and
oppose military action without
UN and parliamentary
approval. Their key pledge
is to continue to fight for an
independent Wales, elevated
from “a minor English region”
as it currently stands. They
promise further powers for
the Welsh Assembly, including
having an independent
commission examine the
distribution of funding across
the UK to ensure Wales gets
the best deal. They would
have the Welsh Assembly
take a more prominent role in
national decisions that have
implications within Wales.
Fun Fact: Dydw i ddim yn siarad Cymraeg. Prediction: Around the same as last time, three, maybe four MPs.
