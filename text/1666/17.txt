ow that raging
socialist retard has
completely lost it.
For him to even
think that Labour
can possibly win is
absurd! It’s just a case of how big
the Tory majority is. My bet is on
over 9,000.
Here’s the truth about the parties
fighting for your vote:
Labour: Deluded commie scum
Lib Dems: Ha ha we screwed
them over in Coalition
UKIP: We gave you Brexit so
vote Tory
SNP: You had your referendum
so shut up
Greens: Flower people
Tories: For rich people (you)
As a loyal Tory, I begin my day
chanting “Strong and Stable” mul-
tiple times until my flatmates tell me
to shut up. May is a great leader!
It’s no matter that unlike Thatcher,
she is for turning, she’s completely
uncharismatic, is stiff and uninspir-
ing and runs away from a debate.
We called this election despite
May’s constant denials, expecting
this to be in the bag. Instead, we
messed up royally and Labour may
actually win this. How could this
happen when we control all the
newspapers and TV news? Unac-
ceptable! That is why I am here to
canvass for your vote with bland,
boring sound-bites.
The Conservatives are the party
for working people. We say that
with a straight face while we cut
your healthcare, your education,
your lunch, your benefits, your
jobs. We will also cut your hair,
your nails, your arms, your nose,
your ears etc. We will alienate the
elderly by cutting pensions and
imposing a dementia tax. Also,
let’s ignore young people who are
the future of this country.
We will help you by focusing our
attention on legalising fox hunting
while nurses and teachers use food
banks. Pooh pooh it’s their fault
for being poor. They didn’t work
hard enough, unlike me who was
born into wealth, went to a private
school and used all my papa’s
connections to get my job.
The Conservatives will grow
the economy. Only rich, well
connected people will benefit
but the wealth will trickle down,
eventually, somehow. We will give
you the right deal for Brexit, under
a Prime Minister who campaigned
against it in a referendum we
badly miscalculated. In order to
distract the masses we will then just
blame everything on immigrants,
which we have failed to limit.
Remember, the Conservative
party is for you, unless you’re
poor, homeless, disabled, young,
in university, not in university,
working class, middle class, work-
ing, unemployed, old or dead. In
which case, fuck you, you useless
deadbeat.
S
o Mrs Thatcher 2.0 is
finally quaking in her
boots. Her 20 point
lead in the polls has
shrunk fast and now
we are on the cusp
of a new dawn. No more will
the people accept a corporatist,
aristocratic, unequal society built
by and for the rich. No to cuts in
the NHS, no to tax cuts for faceless
corporations, no to the lunch
snatcher!
If you are still undecided here’s a
rundown of all the parties:
UKIP: Fascists, racists, Islamo-
phobes, everything-phobe
Tories: Evil heartless scum
Lib Dems: Oh you poor thing
SNP: Please don’t vote for them,
please
Greens: Who?
Labour: The saviour of mankind
Seriously, Corbyn is like your
grandfather whom you can drink
with at the pub while everyone
around him starts moving away.
May is a vampire who feeds off
the blood of the miserable. Like
really, how has no one figured that
one out yet?
Labour has a plan for you. We’ll
throw money at everything, at the
NHS, at schools, at old people, at
babies… it doesn’t matter that we
can’t pay for it, and the rich people
will bugger off when the taxes go
up, we’ll just print money because
we don’t know basic economics.
After all, John McDonnell has
promised solidarity with Stalinists,
and they’re paragons of economic
genius. We’ll keep you safe by
abolishing MI5 and the army,
while we throw billions at Trident
and then never use it. What could
go wrong when we’re friends with
the IRA and Hamas?
It doesn’t matter than 80%
of Labour MPs oppose Corbyn
and that he has never had any
leadership experience. Put aside
your horror at the thought of Diane
Abbott as Home Secretary (and
you thought Boris was bad). The
House of Commons won’t be a
mess and we will negotiate any
Brexit deal even if we don’t know
what we’re doing and those EU
twats rip us off. After all, a bad
deal is better than no deal.
Under Comrade Corbyn, we
will unleash a new society. This is
only phase one. After we nation-
alise the railways and the Post
Office we’re gonna nationalise
everything, the supermarkets, your
favourite restaurant, your parents’
shop, your cat… with no business
acumen, our state-run economy
will then collapse while we blame
everyone but ourselves. Finally, we
will have true Communism. There
will be no need for government,
people will just arrest themselves.
Comrade Corbyn is
finally going to lead us
to a red revolution
