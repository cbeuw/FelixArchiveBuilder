Scrummy noodley goodness
Step away from the Pot Noodle... Take refuge in Tampopo for some funky fast food.
Wel-
come
Fisherites,
Southwelli-
ans and all new
Evelyn Garden
dwellers! You are now
a resident in SW7, surrounded
by yuppies and may find it daunting
to venture beyond Sainsbury’s to find
grub. But I emplore you, Fresher, to
try the fantastic noodle emporium just
around the corner from halls.
Tampopo is anything you want it to
be. It is a pile of healthy, tasty stir fry
when you can’t be arsed to cook or
it is an affordable hot date with that
Physicist you pulled the other night.
Not only this, but they are friendly to
students – all shout HURRAH! The
nice people at Tampopo give students
20% off the whole bill Sunday-Thurs-
day. It’s incredibly good value which
is a rarity in SW7. Also, takeaways are
on offer if you don’t fancy a restaurant
environment.
Hungry Accomplice and I went down
to Tampopo the other night. At 9pm
Tampopo HHHHK
140 Fulham Road
Phone: 0207 370 5355
www.tampopo.co.uk
Best: A student friendly 20%
discount Sun-Thurs. YEY!
Worst:Expensive drinks
Go for...: If you go before 7pm
you can partake in the amazing
value Eastern Express. Choose
a main and accompaniment
for £6.95 e.g. Mee Goreng and
Gyoza (dumplings).
Takeout: Take a look at the menu
on the website, call up and
order. The restaurant does not
deliver but you can pop round
the corner to pick it up.
Price: Under a tenner per head

on a Monday night the place was buzz-
ing with a mix of bankers and students
sharing huge tables, scoffing noodles
or slurping at soup.
Hungry Accomplice was ravenous
so we opted for 2 courses. If you are
feeling thus, Tampopo do a vast shar-
ing platter with satay, dumplings and
other tasty morsels… but a healthier
option is to share a salad. We shared
Gado Gado, an Indonesian salad. The
egg, al dente veg, fresh tofu and prawn
crackers were presented like crudités
centered around a bowl of satay sauce.
This version was suitable for sharing
and gave us a real chopstick work out,
but I’d have preferred the street food
version for shovelling purposes where
the whole lot is mushed together and
smothered in sauce.
Our main courses were Chicken Pho
and Kway Teow. My Pho was Pho-tas-
tic. The Vietnamese soup noodle dish
Cafe Forum - Gooey pizza galore!
A
s we settle down to this
academic year we all
make that fatal mistake
of signing up to ALL the
clubs and societies at the
Fresher’s Fair. You are rushing about,
crashing from this induction to that
initiation... lectures fit in somewhere.
It’s time for fast food. You have to use
your loaf.
Toast can be transformed by even the
biggest nonce into a scrummy snack or
dinner. You can use any bread you like:
brown, white, seeded, rye, pitta, nan,
bagel…Have a try of these nutritious
ideas for the simplest and cheapest
ingredients.
Sardines: Toast your bread and but-
ter heavily. Open a tin of sardines in
tomato sauce and mush with a fork.
Pile on top of the toast and eat. I rec-
ommend one tin per slice of bread
for greediness. For the more demure
among you, half a tin per slice. If you
prefer sardines in oil, give the sardines
a squeeze of lemon before devouring.
Sardines are very very good for you as
they contain a lot of omega 3 and es-
sential oils.
Bruschetta: Chop a tomato and sea-
son with salt and pepper. Add a dash
of olive oil and mix. Tip onto our toast
and VOILA a homemade brushetta!
If you have any parsley or basil lying
around, add that too. Boys – pay atten-
tion to this recipe. Tomatoes contain
lycopene which is incredibly good for
your sperm/your little soldiers.
Fish fingers: Cook 3 fingers of fish as
per instructions and sandwich between
two slices of toast. Smother in ketchup
and munch. Bird’s Eye now does a val-
ue version of their fish fingers – HUR-
RAH for student budgets!
The alternative bacon sarnie: Fry a
rasher or two of bacon and add a couple
of tinned plum tomatoes to the pan to
warm through and pick up some of the
juices from the bacon. Tip the contents
of the pan onto a slice of toast and add
another slice on top. PHWOAR.
Beans and Egg: Beans, beans, good
for your heart: the more you eat them,
the more you… This simple dish of
baked beans topped with a poached
egg has been proven to be the cheap-
est and most nutritious meal you could
possibly eat! Fibre, protein, carbs.. the
whole kaboodle! To poach your egg,
boil about 2 inches of water in a pan of
your choice. Crack the egg carefully in
the water so the white doesn’t spread
too much. Turn off the heat and leave
the egg to cook for 3 minutes. Scoop
the poached egg out of the water and
place it on top of your mound of beans
on toast. Mum would be proud.
If you have any ideas for this year’s
food section please do get in touch.
Seeing as we’re in the winter months,
I am looking for comfort food for us to
slurp at in bowls with a hunk of bread
- stews, soups, a hug in a bowl. Send
us your recipes, restaurant reviews and
articles to food.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Also, if you live near a cheap and fab-
ulous greengrocer, friendly butchers or
market we’d like to hear about them to
pass on the know-how! Besotes xx
was presented in a trough-like bowl
and there was no shortage of chicken!
The broth was flavoured with star an-
ise and red chillie and was so fragrant
it should be in competition to be the
next Herbal Essences. Hungry Accom-
plice’s Kway Teow was a lip-smacking
sit-and-shovel dish. Happily, there
was no short-changing of ingredients
among the pile of noodles. Tampopo
never fails to fill up our bellies and put
a satisfied grin on our greedy gobs.
Tampopo is super-fast, fresh food
and with a bill of less that £20 for 2 it’s
amazing value too. Give it a try, fresh-
er, and let me know what you think. It’s
also a brilliant place for pre or post-
cinema munchies as it’s right next door
to the pictures! And don’t forget your
student card for that all important 20%
off. Isn’t it fun being cheap?
Yummy yummy noodles... down they go... down into my belly.
this place, however such was its legend
status that the old name has held firm.
Café Forum is a must for any fresher,
or indeed student of any age for that
matter. It is a fantastically unpreten-
tious place where students are wel-
comed alongside many of the South
Kensington locals and lost-looking
tourists. Café Forum is a traditional
Italian style café serving good quality
coffees and other hot drinks, freshly
prepared juices, as well as a host of dif-
ferent delicious snacks. However, in
addition to this, Café Forum also acts
as a brilliant one-stop shop for lunch
too. In addition to its home-made pas-

tas and generous salads it also serves
up those legendary pizzas
The pizzas are out of this world. The
bases are gooey, crunchy and extreme-
ly addictive. You choose 4 from a whole
host of veggie, meaty or fishy toppings
and you have the freedom to choose
your base size, depending on your ap-
petite (small belly £3.75, medium tum-
my £4.95, large stomach £5.95). Order
you toppings, size and 10 minutes later,
and perfection is served in front of you.
And if the pizza wasn’t enough, their
desserts are tasty too. Try the apple
strudel and cream for £3.20.
The value for money of this heavenly
caff is almost the best bit. Café Forum
is very cheap indeed. A HUGE regular
£1.40 for a cup of sweet, sweet nectar in this quirky little cafe.
coffee is freshly prepared for you for
just £1.40, and you get a free croissant
with it in the mornings. If the pizzas
don’t take your fancy and you go for a
salad, you can get a large bowl of in-
credibly tasty chicken salad for £3.95.
So as you can see the prices are good.
For me, Café Forum was a great post-
rugby match destination on a Wednes-
day evening. However, it offers such
variety that it can be what you want – a
quick stop for lunch, or a great place
to sit and chat in the evenings – all the
paninis and pastries are reduced after
11pm. Café Forum is a must for stu-
dents, I highly recommend you give it
a try!
Forget the SAF or the JRC: venture out to Cafe Forum. Map provided

Café Forum, or should I say, House
of Coffees, is a legendary pizza-house/
café situated at the top of Gloucester
Road near the tube station. It is my be-
lief that Café Forum is the old name of
