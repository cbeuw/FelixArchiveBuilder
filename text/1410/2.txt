NUS call for nationwide ban
on initiations
Jovan Nedić
Editor in chief
Late last week, the BBC revealed a vid-
eo showing first year undergraduate
students at the University of Glouces-
tershire taking part in an initiation
ceremony, which lead to the National
Union of Students (NUS) calling for a
nationwide ban of initiations.
In the video, the students are seen
lined up against a wall with plastic bag
over their heads, whilst a male in a
Nazi style uniform shouts at them and
encourages them to drink, leading to
vomiting. A university spokesman said
a formal inquiry was being launched
into alleged “bullying and intimida-
tion” during initiation ceremonies.
Student initiations have been in the
media spotlight in the past. In 2003,
18-year-old Alex Doji died in an initia-
tion ceremony at Staffordshire Univer-
sity after choking on his own vomit.
Another student, 18-year-old Gavin
Britton died after attending a golf ini-
tiation ceremony at Exeter University
in 2006. Following these unfortunate
incidents, as well as the recent BBC
report, NUS President Wes Streeting
told the BBC that: “We are totally op-
posed to student initiations. They put
students at serious risk and exclude
students who don’t want to take part in
that binge-drinking culture.”
Imperial College Union [ICU] have
had initiations banned for several
years. In the 2007 Clubs and Socie-
ties Policy, point 63 states that; ‘Initia-
tion ceremonies, or other compulsory
(or effectively compulsory) degrading
rituals, which affects the physical or
mental well-being of members, are
not permitted. Such behaviour may
result in severe disciplinary action be-
ing taken against the club or society,
its committee and any others involved,
and may result in the dissolution of the
club or society.’
In light of recent events, Imperial
College London have also informed
their staff at Harlington and Tedding-
ton Sports grounds to keep an eye out
for any initiations taking part. Neil
Mosley, Head of Sport Imperial, re-af-
firmed this publicly in my presentation
at the sports captains event.
In order for a club to receive union
funding, they have to ensure that any
person may join that club, regardless
of ability. By having initiation ceremo-
nies, clubs were being selective and
would therefore not be entitled to Un-
ion funding. ICU President Jenny Mor-
gan commented that “Our members
are encouraged to enjoy themselves
and celebrate club achievements at the
Union, however, they are also encour-
aged to behave and drink responsibly
whilst doing so. Any profit made by the
bars is ploughed back into the services
provided to our members, for example
through club funding. The best in-
terests of our members are our main
concern and so the Union does not
serve alcohol to anyone who is drunk
and therefore incapable of rational
thought or action because the safety of
our members is absolutely paramount.
We are a charity, and so while our com-
mercial outlets are there to raise funds,
doing so is in no way worthwhile if
our students are at the slightest risk of
danger.”
At universities nationwide, initia-
tions are mainly associated with sports
teams, with many viewing them as a so-
cial bonding tool, whilst others view it
as a form of bullying. Claims have also
been made in the past that initiations
have actually deterred students from
taking part in sports teams, which was
one of the main reasons for ICU to ban
them in the first place.
Back in 2006 [Issue 1346], felix re-
ported on initiations after the death
of a student at Hull who fell down
some stairs after consuming excessive
amounts of alcohol.
Although fears have been raised in
the past over this matter, the main ar-
guments for and against remain. Real-
istically, can there ever be an effective
ban, or will the ban simply cause them
to go underground.

New library
opens, officially
Daniel Wan
News Correspondent
Despite being open and readily avail-
able to students for weeks now, the
‘new’ Central Library was officially
opened last Thursday afternoon. After
a noisy two years and £11 million of
renovation, the Library sees an entirely
refurbished ground floor, whilst the re-
maining floors have been freshened up
with a little more than a paint job.
The provision of a further 150 com-
munal desk spaces, 90 new computers
and a 30 seat capacity training room
goes some of the way in making up for
the years of cramped and sweaty mis-
ery students have had to endure in past
years.
Amongst the stock of numerous
corporate soundbites, official College
releases push the idea of a ‘modern
twenty first century’ library that will
become the ‘cultural hub’ of College
life. Around 50 decorative canvases,
seemingly blank or unfinished, have
been donated by Sussex-based artist
Bob Brighton.
College further boasts of ‘walnut
joinery’, a ‘glass stairway’ and a ‘semi-
transparent think-tank area.’ So,
wooden floor skirting, a perspex ban-
nister and further segregation.
felix went along to cover the official
opening ceremony on the 2nd of Octo-
ber, but were told to “stay out the way’”
of official photography. felix were fur-
ther encouraged to use official photog-
raphy in our coverage of the Library
opening, as to avoid our seemingly
dirtying presence at the ceremony. Im-
perial’s student television station stoic
tv were also turned away, have been in-
formed that filming of the event would
be ‘inappropriate’. felix wonders how
explicit a library opening can be to be
deemed inappropriate for filming. Stu-
dent media was sparse with only Live!
attending.
College delightfully promise that
renovation will continue in aim to im-
prove the upper floors. This includes
the much reported temperature prob-
lem felix covered during the last aca-
demic year. For now though, students
can still be seen to be cooking their
full English breakfasts on fourth floor
desks.
