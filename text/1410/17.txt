Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
Photoshop Competition - 2
Ravi Pall
Coffee Break Editor
H
ello again. Welcome to
another damn fine edi-
tion of Coffee Break.
Honourable mentions
go out to Team Joseph
Gobbels who won last weeks pho-
toshop competition. That picture
made many of the guys and girls down
in the felix office cry hysterically with
laughter. Well done, have a gold medal,
and your on your way to winning an
iPod. I would also like to make a spe-
cial note about this weeks RAW image
of the Live! stand. Live! is one of our
big rivals within the Imperial College
student media. A big shout out to our
friends over there. Keep up the good
work, even though the picture of an
empty stand is somewhat amusing. I
have hope that next weeks entries will
bring the picture to life.
A bonus point will be given to those
Photoshop masters who to manage to
write something amusing in the do-
main name banner.
In a more personal matter, I would
like to say something to the freshers.
“Please stop being so unhealthy!” As a
hall senior I’m surrounded by freshers
everywhere I look. All of them are sick
with freshers’ flu. All it takes is a few
square meals or a vitamin tablet and
you’ll be sorted. You guys are conta-
gious and I’m getting ill. Now I have my
suspicions that it’s all the drinking I’ve
been doing this week but I’m going to
stick with blaming it on the freshers.
Another rant, I’d like to defend cur-
rent felix editor, Jovan Nedic, for last
week’s issue of felix. Sure there were
grammatical errors. Maybe even a few
spelling mistakes, but I am disappoint-
ed with the individuals who have slan-
dered the issue. Most of the student
body understands that it’s the first is-
sue of the year, and there are bound to
be mishaps along the way.
Why then are there some people who
call for the editor to rethink his ideas,
some even stating the newspaper is
going down. It’s a student newspaper
people. Not The Guardian. All the
news, games, sports and comments
are intended for the general student.
So please a little understanding this
week?
As what to look forward to... Snakey
B makes an appearance this week, with
next week seeing the start of Sikh MC.
The FUCWIT league continues and is
going strong. I’ll lay out a league table
when the competition really fires up.
If anything in this or its associate
sections offend you in any way,
please bear in mind I’m not
responsible for the Hangman
team. Those guys are crazy and
as a result don’t blame me.
3. Apple Mac:
You’re sitting in the library. You look
to the left of you. You look to the
right. Apples everywhere. No not the
delicious kind, the knob kind. There’s
even a job at apple to be a campus
rep, but only if you’re a huge mac su-
per freak. However, and it makes me
sad to say it, macs are awesome. Heck
we have at least 8 down here in the fe-
lix office. It’s like a mac mega dream.
Who needs lots of video games.
Spore is all you need right? We’ve all
seen the students sitting around the
JCR on the sofas; drinking their cof-
fee. Some even reading the student
newspaper. The evidence is there, if
you want to look like a smug fucking
git, grab yourself some California de-
signed - Chinese assembled gadgetry
and think of the geeky possibilities.
Also you get to feel superior because
‘macs don’t get viruses’. IT’S NOT
BECAUSE THEY’RE GOOD IT’S
BECAUSE NOBODY MAKES VI-
RUSES FOR MACS.

This weeks winner. Team Joseph Gobbels. Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
This weeks winning entry is a beau-
tiful piece of art. Stop for a moment
and examine it. This team flipped
the face to match the lighting ef-
fects in the imposed picture. With a
magical flourish, they made the eyes
all squinty so he’d look vulnerable.
Finally in a move that clinched the
prize, they opened the mouth, giv-
ing him a baby like look. Opened the
mouth in such a way, he could only be
portraying an innocent baby.
Drink with me, I’m Snakey B
and this week I’m dressed as Muhammad Ali
Joe Gobbels has certainly set the
bar high and if you want to get a shiny
gold medal you are going to have to up
your game. This weeks image provides
a blank slate for all Live! related jokes
so go wild. The high res picture can be
found online at www.felixonline.co.uk.

tab. Email your entry to coffee.felix@
imperial.ac.uk with your team name
with your photo and you’ll be entered
into the FUCWIT league.
I
get no respect at Imperial. I
get nothing. Every night drunk
douche-bags chug me down but
there’s never any care. Some-
times I get spilled, you know
every now and again I even get thrown
back up! It’s disgusting I tell ya, I get no
respect. No respect at all.
Things are about to change though.
Snakey B is back, as Muhammad Ali.
You know me, I float like all those pot-
heads at the back of Sherfield and I
sting like the daily rejections meted on
Imperial guys by members of the op-
posite sex.
And let me say something to all those
haters out there. I am the greatest drink
in the world. No I’m not the greatest
I’m the double greatest. Not only do I
knock Medics out but I pick the bucket
in Reynolds Bar for them to vomit in
and then drink from.
I’m so fast that last night, an engineer
took off a girls clothes and came in his
pants before they hit the ground.
Snakey B, as Muhammad Ali, peace
out Imperial. Who will I be next week?
I really don’t know what to think.
Virgo
There’s a lady whose
sure all that glitters
is gold, and she’s
buying a stairway to
heaven. When she
gets there she knows
that if the stores are all closed with a word she
can get what she came for. It isn’t you. All the
sins you have committed this Freshers, such as
abusing innocent students with your barf, have
landed you into the Second Circle of Hell.
Scorpio
Does anyone except
for the Americans
give a shit about
your star sign?
Apparently so. The
reason you are
reading this is because you are thick enough
to forgo the scientific method that you should
have sworn your life to, after being accepted
by Imperial.
Libra
Okay, so you’re one
of those guys that
thinks that Aber-
crombie is cool.
It’s not. Let me tell
you why. Firstly,
it starts with “Aber”, and that sounds Welsh.
Welsh is most definitely not cool. Second, it’s
not even Welsh! It’s like an Australian whose
great-great-grandauntie was Scottish, and who
therefore thinks he can wear a kilt.
Sagittarius
Imperial College
London, currently
recruiting women.
Unsuccessful much?
Let’s brainstorm:
perhaps we should
have merged with UCL. No, wait, then we’d
have arts students. Barftastic. Them with their
varied interests and presentable clothing. We
could never let them taint the hallowed, unin-
teresting, and highly pretentious halls of IC.
Capricorn
When I said that I’d
do this I thought it
would be easy. Just
think up 12 random
paragraphs and job
done. Turns out that
its much harder. You noticed? Turns out I’ll be
needing 12 more next week...... This is really
hard. I need to find a flaming hot Polish lesbo
to help me out. With writing the horoscopes,
that is.
Cancer
So you’re a Cancer,
you think you
know everything
about God. Damn
everything; well
you’re full of shit!
Anyway this week you’ll probably find out
you have a terminal disease or something
... whatever. That sounds like cancer. Like
I care. I’m not even the guy who writes the
horoscopes.
Gemini
The fact you even
belong to a group
called Gemini
means you should
probably end your
life in a horrible
horrible way. Perhaps by provoking a crack
addict in the early hours of the morning.
What are you like a cheesey pop/rock group
from the 80’s? That’s probably quite mean, but
whatever, I detest you all. Peace!
Leo
This week, does
anyone know what
the best (Blackthorn
excluded. I’d
rather drink from
a chunderpuddle)
alcohol percentage to price ratio of beer in the
Union? Reply to Felix editor Jovan Nedic who
wants to get drunk. Prizes are available in the
form of a free pint of that beverage.
Taurus
This week you
will reaise that
that girl you have
been wooing for all
last year, working
your magic on the
dance floor and buying all those drinks for
still doesn’t know your name. Worse still she
thinks you’re called Kevin. Might as well fuck
off me thinks.
Aries
Trust me on this,
all the Aries guys/
girls absolutely rule!
You will almost
definately find your
true love by the end
of the coming week and even if you don’t you
will at least have an interesting moment with a
flaming hot Filipino homo. You know you love
that shiz, you Rice Queen! Give him a try. He’s
great fun, and fits in a suitcase, to boot.
Pisces
This month you will
fall deeply in love
with a Fresher. You
will dance, sing,
drink and chunder
all over DB’s floor
(in that order) leaving her not very impressed.
Then she’ll leave you for a PhD student who
has been slightly too close to the Nuclear
reactor. She’s gone forever, you fucked up bad
my friend.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
I would like to
point out that these
Horoscopes are
definitly not done
by a half-pissed
student. Felix takes
pride in the fact that each week a professional
clairvoyant is kidnapped and in order to write
them. Claims that she is then released back in
to Imperial gen. pop. are unfounded.

Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced numbers with letters. Once
you’ve completed the puzzle, there is a hidden phrase to find. Email answers to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
The winner of Wordoku will be mentioned here. This is the first one, therefore
there is no winner from last time. Thanks to Chaz for coming up with the words!
Tamara Slutatapova
H
ello, I am Tamara Slu-
tarapova. The Felix
editor asked me to help
guide you through the
inevitable emotional
and social disasters of the coming year.
For the boys – to advise you on how
to woo and secure a decent looking
girl at Imperial. I am concerned be-
cause, from my personal experience
of Freshers’ week, your shortcomings
(ha!) both in conversation and wallet
size leave much to be desired. Perhaps
it is a lost cause and by the end of the
year I will have to simply direct you to
the nearest art college for easier and
prettier conquests. For the girls - I will
help as much as I can. You must un-
derstand, I struggle to imagine your
position. Evidently, you are not pretty
or generous enough to have secured a
man before uni. Instead, you have infil-
trated the male world in order to cap-
ture one off-guard. I look forward to
reading and empathising as best I can
with you over a skinny non-dairy decaf
organic Fairtrade latte.
Dear Tamara,
I met a lovely boy in Freshers’ week and
he took me to his room to watch Sleepy
Hollow. Everything was going great. So.
I was really excited about seeing him
the next night so I put on a really cute t-
shirt from Camden and some sexy jeans
from Topshop. However, when I went to
his room, he started acting really funny
and started getting out trashy under-
wear that he suggested I wear. What’s
going on?!
Confused Camden shopper
Dear Confused Camden shopper,
This all sounds very familiar to me. I
used to go out with a hunky-looking
footballer until I found some suspend-
ers and crotchless pants (suspiciously
labelled “XXL”) and size 13 stilletos.
I’m not sure which was worse, the sti-
lettos being from Shoe Zone or the fact
that my man of the month wore it all on
weekends. However, perhaps your man
has just been picking up bedroom eti-
quette from Hangman. Any man trying
to accessorise an outfit with a piece of
rope is not to be taken seriously.
Dear Tamara,
Instead of picking up Freshers’ flu, I
seem to have picked up something of the
red and itchy variety. What do I do?
Itchy & Scratchy One Man Show
Dear Itchy & Scratchy One Man Show,
I assume you are a sports player and
have participated in Snakebite-fuelled
incestuous Wednesday night at the
Union. You only have a few more days
when you’re contagious so I suggest
you call all those girls from school who
laughed at your big calculator and air-
plane magazines and pay them back.
Good luck and enjoy.
Dear Tamara,
I was always the best in my school and
my teachers had me down to win a
Chemistry Nobel Prize. However, after
a week of Imperial, I ahve realised that
I will never belong in the front rows of
the lecture theatre and never be one of
the clever people here. What can I do to
improve my self esteem?
Back Row Fresher
Dear Back Row Fresher,
Your first year at university is a time to
better yourself and grow as a person.
You must concentrate on the more im-
portant things in life - your looks and
your social status. You will find the two
go hand in hand. If you cannot beat
the kids sitting in the front rows, show
them why they wish they could sit with
you in the back rows (but never allow
them otherwise it loses its mysterious
appeal). Frequent Ethos to meet other
like-minded people and steer clear of
carbs.
