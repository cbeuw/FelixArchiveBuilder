Live from Bosnia and Herzegovina
Lucy Harrold joins “homos and hen nights” for Eurovision-based fun, frolicks, fisting and a singing turnip
A
s I entered the theatre,
not even having a ticket
at that time, I was greeted
by smiley men urging me
to take a badge and a bar-
rage of women who looked like rejects
from the Claire’s Accessories bargain
bin advising me my night would not be
complete without a flag or a clacker or
a strange glowing hooter. Once I finally
got my ticket and found my seat I be-
gan to feel rather apprehensive about
the evening, not helped by the sounds
of said clackers and strange glowing
hooters, and people generally shout-
ing at each other. My companion, Dale,
and I both agreed this would be a night
at the theatre unlike any other as we
compared the countries we would be
representing according badges given at
the door; I had Sweden and my friend
had Italy.
I don’t know why I chose Sweden, I
guess it has something to do with my
love for Ikea, meatballs and ABBA
(but NOT Mamma Mia, if any of you
mention that film I will not be happy).
I have always loved Eurovision and so
wanted to see if this “Almost Eurovi-
sion” would live up to the reality and
my friend, although a fan of musical
theatre, had never been impressed by
Eurovision so needed to be converted
to this most tacky of art forms.
So far so much like a night at the un-
ion, but as the curtain raised to reveal
the stage, crammed with as much glit-
ter as is humanly possible, I realised
perhaps this won’t be so bad after all.
Then our hosts for the evening entered:
Boyka, an ex-Olympic pole vaulter
cum lifestyle programme presenter
played by the hilarious Mel Giedroyc,
and Sergei, a children’s TV presenter
played by Les Dennis and his hilarious
toupee. This set up was all to make us
believe we were part of the audience
for the Eurovision Song Contest taking
place in Sarajevo, Serbia-Montenegro
and it worked! They even had Sir Terry
Wogan appear in a video intro, thus
giving kudos in the eyes of the Eurovi-
sion fans.
And so to the show itself; the general
premise of the Eurovision Song Con-
test (in case you didn’t know) is that
each country presents a song and then
all the other countries vote for their fa-
vourite, or their neighbour, or anyone
but the UK. The Eurovision Song Con-
test is well known for its cheesy dance
routines, dodgy lyrics and removal of
clothes part way through routines. Eu-
robeat has this and much more. Also
like the Eurovision Song Contest, Eu-
robeat had some songs that I found re-
ally dull, such as Iceland’s take on Bjork
and Germany’s attempt at a Kraftwerk
cum performance art type piece which
Dale found uproarious but I didn’t get
at all.
Then there were some songs that
were absolute genius, my favourite
being Poland - the eventual winner of
the evening. Poland’s entry was “To-
gether Again” performed by Toomas
Jerker and the Hard Pole Dancers
(great name, I know) and is probably
the campest thing I’ve ever seen. This
production number included every-
thing you could ever want: men danc-
ing with briefcases then stripping off
their business suits to reveal spandex
unitards, a cute lead singer and a danc-
ing routine that involved fisting (Dale
almost had a fit at this point).
We both decided we were in love
with Toomas Jerker and would be vot-
ing for the Poles, having the chance to
do so just before the interval. The Eu-
to cast your vote. I, of course, man-
aged to cock this up by trying to vote
for Sweden and genuinely felt a bit of a
twat given that this was make believe.
We returned after the interval to
find out the results and to see the half
time entertainment, which was a side-
splitting tale about the joys of Sarajevo
sung by Boyka dressed as a turnip. By
the time we reached the live results I
was actually really excited. The results
were given via a large video screen
with the ensemble members as the
different correspondents, from the
incomprehensible Irish reporter to
the Russian reporter being forced to
change the results by the KGB. There
were also regular visits to the ‘Green
Room’ featuring whoever wasn’t in the
process of changing costume to give
the results (as each ensemble member
plays many different parts). As previ-
ously mentioned, Poland won causing
me to whoop so loud I still haven’t got
my voice back, but also meaning we
got to see their amazing performance
again. This time the lead decided to
remove his shirt halfway through and
run around the auditorium topless.
Sigh. The things I have to see for you,
dear reader. We left the theatre on a
high and spent the entire walk to the
tube humming along.
The show itself had very few negative
points but was let down by some tech-
nical aspects. Throughout the first half
sound was a major issue with the show
being stopped for 10 minutes to fix mi-
crophones. Even after that it was still
difficult to hear what should have been
some very funny lyrics over the back-
ing tracks. These are issues that should
have been sorted out during previews
and so I was disappointed to see that
safety curtain lower half an hour in.
The cast did cover this up well, mak-
ing it feel part of the show with a very
funny comment about Lehman broth-
ers providing the electricity funding.
I also found that a bright, raucous
production didn’t sit well in ornate
Novello theatre and the atmosphere
just felt strange. We were encouraged
to talk after the productions, discuss
our views, interact and generally make
lots of noise; something that disagrees
with my theatre-going etiquette. I was
fine once I got over the fact that I was
allowed to whoop and laugh until I
was hoarse. The audience was also a
strange mix of both traditional theatre
goers and what my friend referred to as
“homos and hen nights”.
This is one of Eurobeats’ charms;
managing to captivate everyone with
a genuinely intelligent, topical humour
brought out spectacularly by our hosts
Dennis and Giedroyc, who came out
with the classic “loosen your geni-
tal cuffs”. The humour also works on
many levels from the subtle to the sen-
sational, from slapstick to political hu-
mour and word play (much of this fo-
cused on bad pronunciation of English
- arms/arse etc.). The ensemble did a
fantastic job of making us believe these
ridiculous characters could actually be
real, but without taking the show too
seriously. The songs are catchy and
well written, each sounding individual
yet all somehow encapsulating that feel
of Eurovision.
Eurobeat manages to combine clever
dialogue with completely over the top
production values to give something
that will appeal to everyone from “ho-
mos to hen nights” to drunken Fresh-
ers’ nights out and even your Mum and
Dad. Eurobeat is Eurovision at its good
old-fashioned best and is one of the
best nights out I’ve had in a long time.
In fact, I think Eurobeat might actually
be better than Eurovision itself.
Eurobeat ends on 15th November
at the Novello Theatre. Go see it -
it’s glamorous, glitzy and gay!
Hmm, we love the smell of sequinned spandex in the morning. Yes, they keep their socks on throughout
You might have guessed that a Eurovision musical was going to be a little bit camp and these sexy, young
Polish chaps provide conclusive evidence of that fact.
