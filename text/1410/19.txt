Although the domestic rowing sea-
son had finished for the summer,
keen members from Imperial College
Boat Club could still be found for-
lornly hanging around the boathouse
in Putney. We could only be shifted
with Tom Sutherland’s solemn prom-
ise of +2000 metre climbs and high
speed descents through the Pyrenees
in Southern France.
And so last August boats were switched
for bicycles and oars replaced with
pedals, all disassembled and loaded
into the mini-bus for the long drive to
the picturesque village of Luz-St-Sau-
veur for some tough pre-season cross
training.
The first four days were spent as-
cending and descending the surround-
ing terrain including past Tour de
France climbs such as the infamous
Hautacam. Road signs are placed at
every kilometre mark detailing the dis-
tance to the summit and the average
gradient until the next sign. Conditions
were misty intially, veiling what must
have been spectacular views resulting
in chilling conditions at high altitudes.
Less steely-nerved cyclists were nurs-
ing their hand cramps and requiring a
change of more than just brake blocks
after particularly steep descents. A
minor respite on day 4 ensued with a
vist to Lourdes and a brief stop-off at
Lac de Lourdes where Winny, who gets
very distracted when within a five mile
radius of a lake, and his speedos, made
their first of many appearances.
On day 5 basecamp was shifted and
the route for the day involved climbing
and descending the highest mountain
road pass in the Central Pyrenees: Col
du Tourmalet towering at 2115m. The
climb to the peak is 19km from Luz St.
Saveur with an average gradient of 7.4%
and reaching 10.2% near the summit.
Regrouped at the peak we realised this
was only as high as the road went. We
had to get to the very top. And touch
it. Bikes were ditched and after an hour
of hiking we arrived at Observatoire du
Pic du Midi de Bigorre at 2877m.
Ben Anstiss and I were less than en-
thused about the lake that Winny had
earmarked for a swim on the way up,
and so we inadvertently smuggled our
way down on the ski lift ending up
on a different mountain, and having
to hitch our way back to the bicycles.
ICBC Own Pyrenees on Cycling Camp
With bicycles and cyclists reunited, a
speedy descent left the troops at the
foot of yet another mountain, and after
climbing Col d’Aspin it wasn’t long un-
til arrival, albeit destroyed, at the cha-
let in Estarvielle.
Taking advantage of fatigue and the
lack of an ability to think rationally,
Winny managed to convince Chewy
(Rachael Davies) and Nick Ablitt to join
him the following day after excitedly
spotting yet another lake on the map.
Will Todd had already annouced his
undying love for Winny and would not
be parted so the foursome headed off
in high spirits the following morning.
After cycling beyond Col du Peyre-
sourde, the road ended turning into a
steep and rough track. Lac de Borderes
ou de Bareilles was the destination,
and while other professional climbers
struggled with hiking boots and climb-
ing sticks, our four heroes, donned in
lycra and flip-flops, shoulder pressed
their bicycles to the summit.
Will and Winny suddenly saw the
lake and although in a state of near
hypothermia they did what they had
come to do. Then the eyes of both
were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves
together and made themselves aprons.
Well sort of… they got dressed again.
Fueled by carefully rationed cereal
barsandonlyahandfulofraisinscondi-
tions continued to worsen and morale
was low. Hallucinations started kicking
in after surviving a viscous bull attack,
some dangerous stumbles and the sud-
den drop in temperature resulting in
an emotionally broken Chewy asking a
distant rock to take their photograph.
Top navigation from Nick eventually
brought the crew safely home. It was,
apparently, ‘Epic’ and the saga was re-
lived over and over and over, and over
again during the drive home in the
mini-bus. Which we couldn’t get out of
for 17 hours. Sigh.
Meanwhile back at basecamp it was
BBQ night. The girls & Ben prepared
the food while the boys stood around
prodding the coals and discussing the
best method of ignition. Sargeant Iain
Palmer assumed control of the cooking
and soon burgers, kebabs and sausages
were being savaged. It was approaching
darkness when our four very exhausted
adventurers made their way back to the
chalet, who were only too delighted to
be bombarded by fireworks upon their
arrival.
Following a tough week on the legs
it was with great relief that the local
lake were offering canoe rentals and
we could give the quads a rest on our
final evening and get some upper body
workouts. But they were too expen-
sive, so we got pedalos instead. After
repeatedly nailing each other up and
down the lake we finally but briefly re-
laxed to catch a few rays.
The minibus was on call all week
for those finding themselves or their
bikes broken half-way up a mountain.
Luckily there were no emergencies
with only a few punctures and a bro-
ken gear cable reported over the week.
Thanks to all our drivers who helped
out. Praise is well due to svelte athletes
Clarice Chung and George Addams for
their ability to tear over the mountains
in impressive style.
Other noteworthy cyclists were John
Davey who ‘owned’ himself all week
and Tom Sutherland, who not only or-
ganised the entire week and planned
the routes but showed impressive
endurance covering as many cols as
possible.
Aching and sunburned, but fit as fid-
dles, we celebrated a very successful
trip upon our return to London.

Following on from the success at the
BUSA Regatta in May, the Boat Club
qualified 5 crews for the European Uni-
versities Rowing Championships held
in Zagreb over the last week of August;
the Men’s and Women’s Lightweight
Double Sculls, Men’s and Women’s
Lightweight Quadruple Sculls and a
Women’s Pair. However, due to logis-
tical issues and increasing costs, only
a small women’s squad made the jour-
ney to Croatia with Head Coach Steve
Trapmore leading the way and hoping
to inspire us all to victory with tales of
how he stroked the GB eight to Olym-
pic glory.
Arriving late Tuesday afternoon,
there was just enough time for a quick
tour of the rowing lake and its asso-
ciated nudist beaches before settling
into our home for the next few days,
the student halls of Zagreb University.
Their kitchens had clearly been well
briefed and were over-zealously ply-
ing us with large amounts of pasta,
potatoes and mystery meat. However,
with the weigh-in imminent, the light-
weights were left to indulge in some of
Slimfast’s finest products whilst eve-
ryone else tucked into their 4 course
meals.
Wednesday morning saw us rising
early for a paddle to make the most of
the cooler temperatures. This was, in
theory, a good idea but it did leave us
with nothing to do all afternoon. With
the sun beating down on us and bore-
dom setting in quickly, Steve had no
option but to agree to our demands of
a trip into town after lunch.
And so off we headed for the delights
of the Botanical Gardens for a relaxing
afternoon, or so we thought. No soon-
er had we driven our way through the
pedestrian zone in the centre of town
and managed to park when Chewy
realised that she’d misplaced her bag
(complete with wallet and passport).
It dawned on us that this was a regu-
lar occurrence and that she would be
ICBC Women Represent GB
threatened with investigation by the
Passport Office and that we really
should try and relocate her bag. It was
also at this point, that Chewy chose to
remind us that she was about to go to
Cambodia to ‘look’ after orphans for 2
months – we wish them luck.
Thursday saw the start of racing
(heats or race for lanes) and the hor-
ror that is the sweat-run for the light-
weights. We piled on the layers and
ran and ran and ran, eventually mak-
ing weight just over an hour before
our race. Without sufficient time to re-
cover, our race was unsurprisingly not
great, but we managed to stay within 2
lengths of the winning Polish crew.
Claire and Chewy were then sup-
posed to race the Lwt double but the
prospect of 5 weigh-ins (and hence 5
sweat runs) in 3 days was too much
to bear and the decision was made to
scratch the doubles entry and focus our
efforts on winning the Quads. The race
officials, however, weren’t so keen on
us pulling out of the race, until Chewy
faked near-death and got the medical
team to declare her unable to race that
afternoon…
The pair of Jenny and Erica raced
well, putting up a good fight for second
place but were unfortunate to be over-
taken coming into the last 500m.
There was no racing scheduled for
either of our crews on Friday, so it was
all about the pre-lunch nap, the after-
noon snooze and the post-paddle kip.
Oh and there was a little bit of loitering
about coffee-shops playing the ‘point-
ing’ game. Which actually involves no
pointing at all. Don’t ask. I don’t get it
either.
The Quad’s Final was on Saturday
morning so it was another early start
as we set about our last-minute weight
loss, which can be summarised as: put
on every bit of kit you own, maybe a
plastic bag if you’re really desperate,
run, strip down and check weight, put
horrible, damp, stinky kit back on,
run…. repeat as many times as neces-
sary. It is as much fun as it sounds. Ste-
ve briefly contemplated documenting
the joys of the sweat run then common
sense got the better of him and decided
that it wasn’t worth risking his life an-
gering the hungry dehydrated skinnies
by sticking a camera in their faces. Oh
and it would seem that in most other
countries, their lightweights actually
are light and don’t do the whole ‘sweat
off 2 kg in 2 hours’ thing. In fact, they
think it’s just silly!
Having learnt from our previous
race, the quad got off to a good start
and were leading coming into the 500m
mark, much to the surprise of Stevie
T. However, that wasn’t to last much
longer as the neater bladework of the
Polish crew took them past and onto
a 2 length winning margin over us and
the 3rd placed Italian crew a further 2
lengths behind.
It was then time for us to indulge in
a much deserved lunch to celebrate the
end of a 3 month diet with cake o’clock
lasting well into the afternoon, whilst
we waited for the Pair’s final. They
raced hard all the way and were chal-
lenging for the Silver medal at half way
but were eventually worn down by a
bigger, more experienced crew.
Drinking commenced in earnest af-
ter dinner to prepare ourselves for the
Euro-pop that we would have to endure
at the ‘Athletes’ party’. Having sent our
intrepid Captain off in search of some
wine, we joined the Glasgow boys for
a few games of 21, which resulted in a
lot of love being declared for Dr Nigel
‘Killer’ Atkins (former Glasgow now IC
coach) and a bit of nakedness.
A bucket of mystery alcohol (with a
hint of Lucozade sport) made a surprise
appearance with its bearer proudly an-
nouncing that he’d ‘pimped out one of
the IC girls to a Polish guy for a bot-
tle of cheap red wine’. Said Polish boy
turned out to be persistent… far too
persistent in claiming his wares. Much
to my embarrassment and the amuse-
Clarice Chung
Imperial College Boat Club
As the rest of College slept soundly
through their final night of term, one
intrepid band of sportsmen set out ear-
ly on a quest to make Imperial proud.
By lunchtime they were waiting in a
traffic jam of what turned out to be
parked cars and driving the wrong way
round the Paris ring road.
We met at 7am, with enough methyl-
atedspiritsinourhandluggagetoexcite
even the most sedate sniffer dog, and
proceeded to smuggle our cooking ap-
paratus through Eurostar security. We
were headed towards Le Mans, France,
home of the famous 24 Hour Touring
Car and Motorbike races, where we
were to compete against 6000 fellow
skaters in one of the biggest amateur
skating events in the world.
The race takes place on the actual Le
Mans circuit, with skaters sleeping and
eating the pit lane. We had arrived the
day before and camped in a field over-
looking the course, preparing both
mentally and physically for the gruel-
ling challenge ahead of us by eating
burnt burgers and drinking.
The following morning was spent
perusing the various skating stalls and
displays while being accosted by vari-
ous larger than life skating Duracell
bunnies (the not-so-subtle sponsor of
Le Mans 24 Hour Skate 2008
Ian Beer the event). At 2pm we were let in to
the track to set up our space in the pits
underneath the stands. Those same
garages you see F1 mechanics spilling
oil in were now full of blow-up beds,
chocolate croissants and skaters dis-
cussing team tactics.
24 hours is a long time to skate, and
while some will inevitably attempt to
do it alone without a break, we had dif-
ferent plans: We had decided to organ-
ise ourselves into a shift pattern with
two groups. We would all race together
during the day, taking one lap each at
a time, but during the night we would
take a rest with one group of us taking
a well-deserved 4 hours uninterrupted
sleep while the others raced on with
more frequent laps, swapping over
about 4am.
The rules of the race were simple;
three categories (Singles, Duos and
Teams) of competitor all skate on the
same track in a relay fashion. Those
with the most laps after 24 hours win!
The course provides excellent skat-
ing, 4.2k with a wonderful smooth sur-
face (a welcome change from our Lon-
don training). As you left the pits there
was a fairly steep 600m climb before a
very tight downhill corner, which the
pros would take tucked over with their
chin almost on their knees while some
of the less experienced skaters strug-
gled to stay upright at all! Rochelle was
forced to employ a rather novel braking
technique, but there were medical staff
close on hand! From there you opened
on to a series of smooth turns and long
gentle straights back to the start.
The race began at 3pm with clas-
sification, a short 300m sprint to al-
locate your team a place along the
starting area, much like in the Racing
car equivalent. We managed a healthy
mid-field placing and Josh was chosen
to race the first lap while those of us
further down the order climbed the
stands to watch.
To start the race everyone found their
allotted position along the start-finish
straight, put their unbuckled skates on
one side of the track and walked to the
other. When the starting orders were
given they then had to sprint barefoot
across to their skates, put them on and
skate off as quickly as possible. The
real pros were able to skate off with
unfastened skates, waiting for the first
descent to tighten them, while others
valued their ankles a little more and
decided it might be better to tie them.
Only a couple of our team had done
this sort of skating before, it was up to
the rest of us to learn the techniques
and etiquette from others as we raced
round the track. As in cycling, swim-
ming and even running you can gain
an enormous advantage by racing in
someone else’s slipstream. In skat-
ing this is taken to the extreme, with
groups of up to 10 skaters all racing in
tight formation, each crouching down
in an aerodynamic tuck position and
grabbing hold of the person in front
for the corners. After a few laps we
realised that the way to get fast times
was not purely by skating hard, but by
being able to latch on to one of these
‘pacelines’ as they are known. There
was no hope of keeping up with the
lycra-clad teams, who were completing
laps in under 7 minutes, but there were
plenty of slower lines which formed
and disbanded all round the course.
Unfortunately, this has its price: since
you had to be skating fast enough to
join any paceline which might pass
you with a short effort, you always ran
the risk of starting one yourself, where
someone may latch on to you and you
have to drag them around the whole
course with no help at all!
Having worked this out a competi-
tion emerged between the faster skat-
ers in our team to see if we could break
the elusive 9 minute lap. This may not
sound like much, but we had all spent
the last month revising in the library
and may have let our intensive training
schedule slip slightly. After an tough
few hours, and more than his fair share
of the communal chocolate, Ian did fi-
nally manage it after 7 or so laps with a
time of 8:52.
As we slowly approached the 20th
hour things were starting to get tough!
The feet preparation rituals were get-
ting more and more involved (carbon
speed skates are not designed to be
either the least bit comfortable nor to
be worn for 24 hours) and our Vaseline
and blister plaster supplies were get-
ting low. Some of the team had decided
to call it a day and we decided to let the
faster skaters take more frequent laps.
Down to 40 minute rotations now
there was just enough time for a 10
minute nap and another croissant be-
fore forcing your feet back into the
skates and limping back to the track!
As the clock ticked ever closer to
4pm things started to get tense for the
ment of all others present, I turned out
to be the object of his affections. Even
stern words from Erica (practising her
best Terminator look) and Stevie T
pretending to be my dad (!?) and slap-
ping him with his gold medal did noth-
ing to dent his determination and I was
forced to make an early retreat to bed.
Judging from the sore heads and feet
the next morning, I gather that a good
time was had by all.
It was a highly enjoyable and suc-
cessful week of racing with IC being
the only squad where every member
won a medal and the lightweight quad
were also the highest placed British
crew, winning the only silver medals.
Many thanks to Stevie T for not only
organising everything, securing sub-
stantial sponsorship which allowed us
to go on this trip but also for a sterling
effort looking after us all and dealing
with all the hunger-induced tantrums
from the Lwts.
teams at the top who were tied on laps.
The final rounds had to be taken by
the same person, traditionally waving
their flag behind them and treating the
last laps as more of a procession than a
race, the top teams however continued
sprinting right down to the bitter end.
Being tied on laps it was down to the
first over the line after the 24 hour bell
had rung. We climbed up to the stands
again to watch the teams come home,
for the first time noticing the varied
fancy dress that some had worn, one
team choosing to race the entire event
in leather jackets, another in dresses
and (looking at the photos online)
someone dressed as a giant battery.
Erika brought our team in for a very
respectable 7th out of 15 university
teams, managing 131 laps. The over-
all winners completed an astounding
206 laps, the fastest recorded lap time
being 6:17 (an average speed of over
45kmh!). We averaged a more sensible
average of around 11 minutes.
No doubt the exhaustion-induced
hallucinations of skating baguettes
shall haunt us forever, but if you still
think all this sounds like a whole lot
of fun and want to join in then come
along to our skating sessions in Hyde
Park every Wednesday afternoon and
have a go!
GB was represented by universities across the UK with IC highest placed.
