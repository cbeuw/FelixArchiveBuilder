Henry Whittaker
I
’m Henry Whittaker, a 4th year
Civil Engineer. I would like to be
your DPCS next year. I have been
heavily involved in clubs since my
first year and have worked with
Union staff on many events, helping
to deliver years of fresher’s weeks
and summer balls. I have experience
of a range of club activities and events
through my role as Dramsoc technical
director.
Through my role of Arts and Enter-
tainments Board Treasurer I have
tried to look after the A&E club fi-
nances and guided the A&E clubs
through budgeting, including working
with Union staff to improve eActivities
and solve problems brought to me by
my clubs.
I feel my experiences from Dramsoc
and A&E has given me essential
knowledge of how the Union works
and ways to improve it.
I would like to:
- Bring financial power to club officer
and Management group level
- Create a training website that can be
searched and students ca contribute
to
- Overhaul club finance system, and
improving eActivities
- Create an online Volunteering
database
- Better system for annual Budgeting,
using realistic budgets
- Create a new union shop, with an in-
house developer
- Make metric a usable space for clubs
- Have transparency on expenditure
on new staff
Please vote for me putting an enthu-
siastic, experienced and committed
student in charge of your clubs and
projects next year. If you are interest-
ed in my plans, find out more or share
your own ideas at my website:

T
hroughout my time at Im-
perial I have been heav-
ily involved with the Union,
primarily chairing Cinema
and the Arts & Ents Board.
Sitting on many Union committees,
including Council and the Executive
Committee, I have already made fi-
nancial decisions at every level. In
past summers I’ve worked in private
equity and at Citigroup, which has
granted me a great deal of extra busi-
ness experience. Last year I used this
knowledge to resurrect the dormant
Cinema Society, and can do the same
now for your bars.
I have 10 key policies; each is a re-
alistic solution to the problems and
complaints the Union has repeatedly
faced. The Union is here for you, and
my policies will make your experience
less expensive and life more enjoy-
able. I will provide you with opportu-
nities for flexible employment and will
make the bars extra money, which will
then be used to support Welfare and
Clubs and Societies.
I will:
1. Remove entry charges to the bars
2. Employ more student staff & im-
prove their training
3. Stock a regularly changing selec-
tion of well-kept ales
4. Introduce a separate, quick ser-
vice, lunch menu
5. Sell better value evening food for
longer
6. Introduce catering quality control at
the point of service
7. Give student DJs a chance
8. Bring back barnights
9. Simplify club officer finance training
10. Strip out bureaucracy in club fi-
nance procedures

I
have worked for ICU as a Senior
Steward/Entertainments Offi-
cer and have been involved in
Clubs and Societies, from RSM
Vice-President to GSA Treasur-
er, as both an undergraduate and
post-graduate. I feel I have the best
all-round knowledge and experience
for the DPFS role. On top of this, I
have external financial experience
from working in consultancy.
Having managed ICU events on
a weekly basis, I know what does
and what doesn’t work at ICU. I
know where money is being wasted
that could be better utilised for the
benefit of students. I want to give
students free entry to their own stu-
dents’ union by reviewing staffing
costs, the entertainments budget
and the products ICU sells. Utilis-
ing sponsorship will help reduce the
costs of Union events and also drive
down mini-bus hire costs.
Being both a sportsman and pas-
sionate about arts, I want to give
sports teams the ability to ‘take
over’ Sports Nights and open up Fri-
day nights to Arts and Ents societ-
ies so they can use their own ideas
and creativity, removing the expen-
sive entertainments people don’t
want to see and changing the music
policy. I will overhaul the Summer
Ball, We Are Metric and Bar Night
templates to make them viable and
more appealing to students.
I want to see entertainments
lead by student input, pushing for
the reintroduction of the Entertain-
ments Sabbatical position. Vitally,
the finances saved through these
changes will allow budgets to be
improved, and costs to be cut, for
Clubs and Societies.
