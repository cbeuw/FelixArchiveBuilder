ELECTION PULLOUT
8
Abdul Patel
T
he sabbatical officers are
here to ensure that your
time at the college is as
pleasant as it could be,
and, if elected, that’s ex-
actly what I intend to do.
As Student Trustee, I sit on the
highest board in the Union, over-
seeing Council, Executive Commit-
tee, Court and all Faculty Unions. As
such, I am well aware of the Union’s
finances and operations. Being the
most senior student ambassador, I
represent the college both domesti-
cally and internationally in addition
to holding many other posts such as
the Union’s Court Advocate. Com-
bined, this makes me one of the
most experienced candidates going
for this position.
If elected I will ensure the
following:
-Putting constant, active pres-
sure on the college to address is-
sues such as poor teaching quality,
inadequate feedback and lack of
resources
-Pushing for a podcast system
(audio and visual recordings of all
lectures)
-Implementing a cashless card
system to be used around college
which can be topped up (similar to
an oyster card)
-Driving the Union to provide great-
er transparency, accountability and
reduced bureaucracy
-Greater involvement and inclu-
sion of underrepresented groups
such as post grads and internation-
al students.
-Generating additional revenues
by renting out facilities over summer
The most important part of any
union is its students and this is
the only time you really/ truly have
your say. I will ensure your voices
are heard and promise you better
representation.
Vote experience, Vote dedica-
tion, but most importantly, Vote for
someone that listens and cares.
Vote Abdul.
Henry Abbot
A
s the current Athletics
Clubs’ Committee Chair
I represent a fifth of Im-
perial’s students at vari-
ous Union committees
including Council and the Clubs
and Societies’ Board as well as
several College committees. The
Union President’s job is very similar
to this; being the public face of the
Union, helping and directing the run-
ning of the Union and representing
the student body on lots of College
committees. I have both the neces-
sary knowledge of the Union’s run-
ning and the experience of dealing
with College to get students what
they want. This is why I am the can-
didate best suited to being your
next Union President.
If elected I will:
- Use my integrity and experience
to effectively represent the student
body, rather than myself
- Trust students more. Employ-
ers know how great Imperial’s stu-
dents are, but it doesn’t seem the
Union does. I will give student of-
ficers more power and reduce the
red tape, as well as providing new
UROP-type placements for students
to work at the Union over the sum-
mer to help prepare societies for
the new year
- Restore the funding to Club and
Societies for 2013/14 to at least
the level available in 2011/12
- Remove regular entry charges to
the Union. It is unfair for the resi-
dents of Beit to have to justify their
existence to the union staff and
paying to get into the bar because
the nightclub is open doesn’t make
sense. Let’s give the Union an inclu-
sive ethos and allow people to casu-
ally drop by.

O
ur Union needs some-
one with realistic ideas
and improvements. I
have the experience
and dedication to be
President from roles as RCSU Vice-
President, the Union’s System Ad-
ministrator and Finance Society
Vice-President. I have worked hard
this year organising events and rep-
resenting scientists to their Faculty:
now I want to use this experience.
• I promise to revise the new Re-
sponsible Drinking Policy to follow
the law, whilst putting the fun back
into our bars.
• I promise to stop door charges for
entry to our own Union.
• As it’s financially viable (RCSU
does it), I want an ‘open bar’ Sum-
mer Ball.
• I promise to spend time with stu-
dents: currently hardly anyone sees
the people that represent us.
• I promise to improve our online sys-
tems, saving time for club officers.
• I promise to put money back in stu-
dents’ pockets by introducing more
student jobs in the Union.
• I want the Union to become a place
students go to relax throughout the
day – using Metric as a break-out
space by day, and as a club at night.
• I want to make the Union more
transparent and better communi-
cate the work it does for students.
As the only candidate from a Fac-
ulty Union, I have experience in
dealing with representation to Col-
lege. I promise to battle for fairer
exams, better feedback, affordable
halls’ rents and reinstating the hall
senior subsidy.
I have more manifesto points on
my website: icpaul.com. If success-
ful, I will make the necessary chang-
es to take our Union from strength
to strength.
PRESIDENT
