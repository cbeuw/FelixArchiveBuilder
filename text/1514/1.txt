country submitted bids for the award
which were judged based on the qual-
ity and volume of medical research
they support, and the strength of their
partnerships with universities and in-
dustry. The award will fund research
nurses and technician posts as well
as support studies into treatments for
conditions including cancer, diabetes,
stroke and obesity.
Martin Wilkins, director of clini-
cal investigative sciences at Imperial
College Healthcare NHS Trust and
head of experimental medicine, said,
“This is a very prestigious award and
is a testament to the excellent clinical
research already happening in Impe-
rial College Healthcare Trust.
“This funding, and the strong part-
nership between Imperial College
London and our Trust, will ensure that
we are well placed to translate the lat-
est research discoveries into clinical
practice to benefit our patients.”
Set up in 2001, the McMichael
Clinical Research Facility has recent-
ly reopened on the ground floor of the
Imperial Centre for Translation and
Experimental Medicine at Hammer-
smith Hospital. It specialises in the
design and implementation of early
phase clinical trials including first-
time-in-human trials.
