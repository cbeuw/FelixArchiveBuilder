ELECTION PULLOUT
James Tsim
T
he RCSU needs a president
with great ideas and the mo-
tivation and ability to make
them become reality. The
RCSU is here to inspire stu-
dents to embrace opportunities, and I
have the enthusiasm to encourage stu-
dents to get involved.
There is so much the RCSU can do
for you. Vote James Tsim because I will:
• Work to ensure a full set of past
papers and answer schemes in all de-
partments are available and the oppor-
tunity to view your exam papers after
results.
• Introduce recorded lecture mate-
rial on Blackboard, so students can
review past lectures.
• Provide students with sufficient
printing credits.
• Organise inter-university social
events, so you can network with stu-
dents on your course from different
universities.
• Open up a vast array of opportuni-
ties to students who want to gain expe-
rience and join the teams in the RCSU.
• Provide you with top-class work-
shops and career talks, helping you
take the first steps towards a success-
ful career.
• Strive to make Social Events better
than ever before, keeping them cost-
effective, fun and a night to remember.
• Improve student feedback on as-
signments.
I am friendly and experienced individ-
ual: I am a RCSU Faculty representa-
tive in the council, so I know what the
RCSU wants and needs. I am also Trea-
surer of Artifact Imperial, Pimlico Tutor
and sit on the Union’s Entertainment
Strategy Group, working to improve the
entertainment at Imperial.
I am posed to take on new chal-
lenges, and now want to turn my full
attention and efforts to developing the
RCSU.
John Xin Zhan
I take great pride in the fact that
we have such an enthusiastic stu-
dent body at RCSU, which is the
foundation for the success of our
Union. Having been a member of
RCSU, I would absolutely love the
opportunity to step-up my contribu-
tion by becoming the next President!
As RCSU President, I will ensure
to:
• Improve your overall study expe-
rience
• organise more non-banking
events for the scientists and keep
up the good work of other events
such as the Winter Ball
• introduce more interactive
events, such as the Science Chal-
lenge
• host more talks on internships
and how they work, increasing stu-
dent awareness
• Improve the buddy scheme
Above all, it would be a great hon-
our to serve you because you make
RCSU everything that it is!
