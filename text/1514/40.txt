Imperial Fairtrade Fo
Ingredients
For the cake:
50g walnut pieces
225g Fairtrade light brown sugar
225g soft unsalted butter
200g plain flour
6 teaspoons Fairtrade instant espresso
powder
1 teaspoon of Fairtrade cinnamon
2 1⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
1⁄2 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
4 eggs
2 x 15ml tablespoons milk
For the espresso buttercream frosting:
350g Fairtrade icing sugar
175g soft unsalted butter
2 1⁄2 teaspoons instant espresso powder,
dissolved in 15ml of boiling water
Others:
25 g walnut halves, or enough to decorate 20
cm cake tin
Method
Preheat the oven to 180 Degrees Celsius/ gas
mark 4. Bash walnuts to a rubbly powder
(leaving little bits and pieces will be fine)
with a rolling pin and mix with the rest of
the dry ingredients.
Cream the butter and sugar together,
and beat in the dry ingredients and eggs
alternately.
Finally, add in the milk slowly
while constantly beating the mixture. The
mixture should give a smooth consistency
(add less or more milk depending on this).
Pour the cake mixture into the baking tin
and bake in the oven for roughly 30 minutes,
or until the sponge has turned brown or feels
springy to touch. A sharp knife can be used
to pierce the cake layer to check whether the
baking is done.
After baking, leave the cake to cool on a
wire rack.
Start making the buttercream frosting by
boiling some water in a small saucepan and
adding the espresso powder.
Sieve the icing sugar in a bowl and beat
in the butter with a wooden spoon. Add in
the hot coffee liquid mixture slowly and mix
well.
Once the cake has cooled down enough,
spread the espresso buttercream frosting on
top of the cake and decorate with walnuts
and some cinnamon powder.

8. Equally distribute the batter into the cases
adding a few blackberries into the cases as
this is done so that they are in the middle of
the muffin.
