The final main competition winner, Faye Thomsit, fired up the fruits and created a Foxy
Fairtrade Sunshine Soufflé, winning a copy of Just Desserts: 50 sweet surprises using Fairtrade
ingredients
3RD
12g Tate & Lyle Fair trade Gran Sugar
1kg
Free Range Egg separated
(or one white, to ½ yolk if scaling up)
Method
For the Soufflé grease the ramekin with
oil, then finely grate the chocolate into
the ramekin and roll it round the sides.
Place 25g of dark chocolate in con-
tainer in warm/simmering water (make
sure the container does not touch the
bottom of the saucepan, or the choco-
late will burn), alternatively melt the
chocolate in the microwave, using short
bursts, checking and stirring regularly.
Whisk the egg yolk to firm peak (bit
stronger than soft), then whisk the yolk
and the sugar together. Drizzle the
melted chocolate into the yolk mixture.
Add the whites bit by bit into the yolk
and chocolate mixture; then fold the
whites in gently, without losing any air.
Spoon the mixture into the ra-
mekin and cook for 25 minutes.
Do not open the oven door
during this time, as this will
cause the Soufflé to collapse.
Dressing the plate; Use the spare ra-
mekin to mark the centre of the plate;
then lay the papaya cubes round the ra-
mekin in a circle. Next lay the mango
slices out like rays of the sun, spreading
from the papaya. Between each piece
of mango, place a round of banana,
then sprinkle on the coconut if desired.
Place the honey and lime in the
saucepan, 5 minutes before the souf-
flé is cooked, warming into a dress-
ing, and drizzle over the fruit sal-
ad. Take the soufflé from the oven,
place on plate, serve immediately.
Enjoy with a partner or a friend.
