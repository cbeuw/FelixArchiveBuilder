Sudoku with words, it’s
that simple. Every row,
column and 3x3 box must
contain the letters in the
grid once and once only.
Along one of the rows or
columns, a chemically rel-
evant word or phrase will
appear. Nine-letter words
are hard to find, you know.

An old favourite returns, as ever: the Nonogram! The cells in a grid have to be coloured or left blank according to numbers at
the side of the grid. The numbers measure how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.
The overall solution should yield some sort of picture, or as good as a picture can look in monochrome on a 15x15 grid. As
usual, answers to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Having trouble with the Felix cryp-
tic crosswords in the sports sec-
tion? No idea what it all means
or would like to know why some
answers are as they are? Contact
puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk
with the subject line “Cryptic
Help”. You’ll be sent an introduc-
tion to how cryptic crosswords
work and what to look out for.
Each week you’ll also receive
complete explanations to the an-
swers in the previous week’s Fe-
lix cryptic crossword.
