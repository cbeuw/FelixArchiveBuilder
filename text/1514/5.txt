Break-in at Beit Hall
Student residence Beit Hall was dis-
rupted on Wednesday 29 February
following a series of thefts that took
place during a fire alarm. Following
the alarm, which began at 1am and
lasted for 45 minutes, students who
left their doors open during the com-
motion returned to find items such as
cash, jewellery and personal items
missing. Concerns were soon raised
as to whether the fire alarm was set
off with the express intent of creat-
ing the opportunity to raid students’
rooms.
Due to room doors in Beit requir-
ing keys to be locked, many affected
students were already used to leav-
ing their doors open, which resulted
in them being more vulnerable in a
situation such as this. It is assumed
that the thief travelled from room to
room, checking for unlocked doors.
The thief was later caught by secu-
rity.
A student, speaking to Felix anony-
mously, said: “it was 1am and I was
so tired that I didn’t think twice
about locking my door,” adding, “I
got back to find my cash had gone, it
was shocking”. Felix contacted Neil
McIntyre, warden at Beit Hall, who
said that the “thefts are being inves-
tigated by the police”.
Halls in Prince’s Gardens such as
Eastside and Southside and their con-
stituent sub-halls have mechanisms
to automatically lock doors when
students leave their rooms. This,
although resulting in an increased
amount of people being locked out,
helps to protect their assets. Most
other halls require physical keys to
open and lock doors.
After the thief was caught, the sto-
len items were retrieved and students
were urged to declare if they had any
items missing to the wardening team.
The team aims to successfully return
all the items to the students.
“I didn’t think twice
about locking my
door [...] it was
shocking”
