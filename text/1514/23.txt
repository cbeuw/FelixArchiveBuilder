ELECTION PULLOUT
Douglas Hunt
A
s Deputy President (Edu-
cation) I will:
- Work towards achiev-
ing personalised feed-
back on exams through
personal tutor meetings.
- Improve graduate prospects by
creating an Imperial student forum
for internships and year in industry
placements.
- Encourage faculties and de-
partments to set up exchange pro-
grammes with other world class uni-
versities outside Europe.
- Increase SOLE participation
rates across the college and make
sure the results are acted upon.
-Raise awareness of student rep-
resentation.
- Carry on the current DPE’s work,
which includes campaigning for lec-
ture podcasts and improving the
buddy system.
As Chemistry Departmental Rep-
resentative I fully understand the
role and responsibilities of being
DPE, whilst currently having a con-
tinuous dialogue with Jason Parmar
(current DPE). Furthermore I am
used to dealing with teaching staff
that resist change, I know what im-
provements students want and I ap-
preciate that issues can take more
than one year to solve.
I have shown a strong interest
in education from working in nurs-
eries, inner-city London schools
and being one of Imperial’s Teach
First Brand Managers. Additionally,
I have actively shown a passion in
the education Imperial offers by
working with the current DPE on
Notebox and being involved in the
buddy system for the last two years.
I am not doing this for my CV,
as I have already secured and de-
ferred my dream graduate job. The
only reason I want to be DPE is to
improve the quality of education at
Imperial.
So don’t be a mug, vote for Doug!!!
Alexander Karapetian
F
rom the first day I started
at Imperial I knew I was
going to dedicate myself
to Felix. Since then, I’ve
served the paper for three
years undertaking various roles in-
cluding News Reporter, Photogra-
pher, Copy Editor, Web Editor, News
Editor (2010-11) and Science Edi-
tor (2011-12). Having always had a
keen interest in writing and journal-
ism, I’ve worked hard to stay on
top of issues at Imperial, providing
you with weekly news and relevant
features.
A vote for me is a vote for Trans-
parency, Stability, and Professional-
ism. We’ve been your voice since
1949 and we need to stay true to
this in an open and social manner.
If elected, I will set up and man a
Felix stall in the JCR every week to
give you a platform to approach us,
ask questions, get involved, or sim-
ply voice your criticisms.
As your Editor, I will bring back
Hangman and make sure Felix is
kept humorous by introducing two
new subsections to it to keep you
entertained. We need more comics,
more wit, more investigative journal-
ism and more satire, and I mean
Mock The Week style repartee lo-
calised to Imperial.
I love Felix, and with the experi-
ence I’ve gained, I’ve been able to
ensure my sections were produced
to the highest standards in both
content and coverage. I aspire to
bring this rigorousness to the whole
paper. Felix is an award winning
publication, and your vote can keep
it that way. Vote Alexander Karape-
tian. For full details of my ideas,

I
stand before you, possessing
the finest qualities of two in-
fluential men - the integrity and
honesty of Rupert Murdoch,
combined with the power and
popularity of Nick Clegg. Actually,
hold up - best ignore that.
Transparency in politics is impor-
tant - no one appreciates secretive
politicians. Should I become editor
I would use my place in the Union
to report on as much Union politics
as allowed under the constitution,
in order to inform fellow students of
what goes on and why, as well as
keep the Union on its toes.
Regarding recent controversies, I
believe that whilst Felix should aim
to conform to the standards set by
the British press (minus the phone
hacking) Hangman deserves great-
er freedom of expression. Should
Hangman still be cancelled I will
bring it back, as I know the sec-
tion has the potential to offer up
good, satirical humour. I won’t im-
pose hard and fast rules upon the
section, and will judge each piece
on its own merit. I will continue to
encourage new writers to write for
the paper, emphasising its more
relaxed nature - Felix isn’t an exclu-
sive society!
Over time I wish to refine the num-
ber of issues printed each week, re-
ducing wastage. This will be through
discussion with the printers and
weekly assessment of the number
of wasted copies. Likewise, I hope
to reduce the number of adverts
found in the paper, though only if
this does not come at the cost of
reduced quality.
Laurence Pope - for a phone-hack
free Felix.
DEPUTY PRESIDENT (EDUCATION)
FELIX EDITOR
Timothy Arbabzadah
I
’m currently the Comment Edi-
tor and love writing for, editing,
and reading Felix. My plan for
Felix is the following:
• A fun and more enjoyable
Felix, without sacrificing the serious
side. I’m aiming for a perfect bal-
ance of the two.
• More investigative reporting to
get news stories, and exposés on
all aspects of student life. Ranging
from the social life to things that im-
pact your degree like feedback.
• Ensuring the College, the Union,
and those in positions of power are
held accountable for their decisions.
All while explaining what decisions
taken by senior figures mean to you
the students.
• Cheaper adverts for Clubs and
Societies. They shouldn’t feel priced
out of advertising their events, espe-
cially when there are other streams
of revenue.
• Adding another page of purely
comedy content to make lectures
that little bit more bearable.
• Redesigning the paper to make
it more visually appealing and keep
it fresh. At the moment it’s very
professional but it sometimes has
a wall of text feel. I would train the
section editors to fully use Photo-
shop as well as InDesign to make
sure the paper looks great each
week.
• Personally handing out copies of
Felix every Friday during lunchtime
by the JCR, so I can instantly get
your thoughts on the paper.
• Felix office parties, open to all,
with free drinks and food. If elected,
you’ll hear that there “ain’t no party
like a Felix office party”.
