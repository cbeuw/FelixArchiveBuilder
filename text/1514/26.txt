ELECTION PULLOUT
6
Temi Ladega
T
he role of the President of
the CGCU is to ensure that
you, the engineers of Impe-
rial have the best academic
and social experience that
this faculty can provide and if elected
I will do this to the best of my ability.
In the past two years at Imperial, I
have served as a Year Rep, Hall Se-
nior, Sports Captain and a Dep Rep
allowing me to build my experience of
working with students, society mem-
bers, CGCU execs, faculty staff and
Sabbs to better the student experi-
ence. I am aware of and embrace the
history and the traditions of the CGCU
and aim to continue the good work
that has been done to build our faculty
union back to its former glory.
If elected I will endeavour to see the
following fulfilled:
- I will work towards building a great-
er interdepartmental cohesiveness
through working with events officers
and others to provide a greater diver-
sity of events and opportunities.
- I will work towards supporting and
developing engineering societies to
bring back the fun in being an Imperial
engineer and provide opportunities for
all students to network with Alumnus.
- I will work to increase faculty trans-
parency in terms of academic affairs
and will endeavour to make the CGCU
work for its students, so that you can
get the support you need when you
need it.
I believe in supporting students,
working for societies and building this
union because I care.
Let’s work together to make the
CGCU great.
Vote Temi.
Jialin Li
I
am Jialin Li, and I’m delighted
to announce to run for the
CGCU President for the coming
year.
We engineering students are
the future of the world! What we gain
from the university will determine
what the society will gain from us,
so everyone’s wellbeing matters!
I know you expect more from this
college. You want your hard work to
be seen and rewarded; you want
your suggestions not only to be
heard but also to be fulfilled; you
want the faculty to support your
dreams as well as supporting you to
become a successful engineer, and
you want to make a difference dur-
ing the most wonderful 3 or 4 years
in your life but just need someone
to help... Yes, I know all this. What
I need is a chance to make this all
come true for you.
I’m running for the CGCU Presi-
dent because I care about our fac-
ulty, and I care about you. For any
suggestions or complaints from any
of you, I would never say “no this
cannot be done or changed”, even
you want to have lectures on the
Moon, I would always tell you that
“let’s push it forward together, to
see how far we can get”. You know
that unlike scientists, there is noth-
ing impossible for engineers! (No of-
fence! :D)
I’m young but experienced. I
founded China’s only national stu-
dent union for international schools,
and it’s still expanding and develop-
ing. Vote me for change, and I’ll de-
liver you promises.
Shiv Vohra
I
take great pride in the fact
that we have such an enthu-
siastic student body at ICSM,
which is the cornerstone for
the success of ICSMSU.
I’ve been immersed within IC-
SMSU for two years, and I would
absolutely love the opportunity to
step-up my contribution by becom-
ing the next President!
As a current Academic Officer,
I’ve forged close working relation-
ships with Faculty staff, which is
vital for ensuring that the voice of
the student body is heard and that
there is an effective channel of
communication between students
and Faculty.
Education
Ultimately we’re at ICSM to be-
come some of the best doctors in
the world. Final year is undergoing
fundamental changes next year,
which will impact on virtually all as-
pects and year groups of the medi-
cal school. This is exactly where my
experience lies, so I firmly believe
that I can effectively oversee the
implementation of these changes
to ensure an effortless transition.
Careers
Our students consistently excel
in the UKFPO applications. I will do
everything to ensure that our stu-
dents are fully equipped to continue
to succeed, in the face of upcoming
changes to the UKFPO system.
Biomedical Sciences (BMS)
With BMS now entirely part of the
Faculty of Medicine, I believe that
this is an excellent opportunity to
fully integrate BMS students into
ICSMSU.
Welfare
Welfare support is paramount to
the wellbeing of our students. I am
very eager to operate an open-door
policy, and to continue with welfare
campaigns.
Finances
With inevitable funding cuts, it’s
imperative that we increase our
self-generated income in the im-
mediate future by looking for new
sponsors.
Alumni
Our Alumni will play an increasing-
ly important role in sustaining our fi-
nancial security in the longer term,
and it’s essential that we continue
to develop and expand the relation-
ship with our Alumni Association.
Clubs & Societies
Clubs & societies are the life-
blood of ICSM. I will strive to en-
sure that their budget is protected
as far as possible. I’m also commit-
ted to ensuring that clubs are kept
fully informed regarding any devel-
opments with the ongoing BUCS
issue.
Entertainments
The timing of RAG week, STFYD
and the Summer Ball needs a fun-
damental rethink, primarily due to
final year restructuring.
Sites & Services
I will endeavour to continue the
fantastic work of the current SU
regarding Reynolds redevelopment.
Above all, it would be a great hon-
our to serve you because you make
ICSM everything that it is!
