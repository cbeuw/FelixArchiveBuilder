With the formal greetings from both
universities swiftly over, the Hitotsub-

Kendo

Kendo club recieve visit
from Hitotsubashi
in the Union gym, we put our guests to
the test. Nothing says welcome more
than running through training drills,
sparring and demonstrating your “Kiai”
(war cry used to both intimidate/domi-
nate the opponent & psyche up your-
self) to your opponent. Well, nothing
except for a few rounds of drinks after-
wards. However, this was only a small
glimpse of ﬁne Kendo. The main event
was still to come.
That following Saturday the students
from Tokyo were greeted by a much
larger crowd with members from do-
jos around and outside London making
a total of 60 “kendōka” (person who
practises kendo) on the day. The day
began with a performance by Chida-
Senpai himself and one of his students.
The demonstration was of an ancient
form of “kata” (the essence of Japa-
nese swordsmanship linking modern-
day kendo to the teachings of the many
early kenjutsu schools) passed down
through generations of pupils from the
jikishinkage-ryū school of combative
swordsmanship founded in the mid-
16th century. Each stage of the per-
formance symbolises each of the four
seasons, ranging from explosive and
intense movements to represent Sum-
mer, to the more slow, reserved pace of
Winter.
This was followed by the moment
we had all been waiting for. When we
strapped on our “bogu” (armour) and
fought in a friendly individuals compe-
tition versus the Hitotsubashi students.
The traditional rules being the ﬁrst
player to score two clean hits on the
other within a two minute match is de-
clared the winner. After the ﬁrst seven
matches we were in the lead, though
the students from Japan quickly turned
things around in the later rounds. Both
sides fought valiantly till the end with
the ﬁnal match lasting well over 10min-
utes with neither side showing any sign
of defeat.
The day was rounded off with an hour
of sparring and a great social meal in
Eastside Bar with our new friends from
the East. After waving our ﬁnal good-
byes we quickly wrote plans in our dia-
ries to hopefully meet again, though this
time it will be on their side of the world.
