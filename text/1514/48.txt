aturday the 3rd of March
marked the first Imperial Col-
lege Wakeboard competition
of the year. Held at Princes
Waterski club, west of Lon-
don, the Imperial Wakeboarders decided
to show their unity and team strength by
arriving en masse in a union minibus.
Unfortunately certain members of the
club hindered this impressive arrival by
valuing either sleep or sightseeing (read
– getting lost) above the targeted 11am
arrival. Team morale was not particularly
high, as one member voiced his displea-
sure with “I hope you die in a car crash”-
type sentiments.
Once out on the water, the sun came
out and the general good will prevailed.
First up was the men’s beginner category.
Unfortunately the warm-up session had
claimed its first victim as Oli pulled out
due to illness and injury. Being the true
student representative of Imperial, he
then strategically set about earning back
his competition entrance fee in cans of
energy drink – which were offered by
one of the event’s sponsors. Meanwhile,
Tom Jones and Jake Gillespie set out to
show last year’s winner and team mem-

the judges’ eyes. Jake a.k.a. “Guy in the
Hawaiian shorts” came through after two
group heats, to earn a place in the 5-man

Club president Danielle Barnes was
“in it to win it” in the women’s inter-
mediate group, showing that style and a
certain degree of risk taking can be re-
warded over riders with a more cautious
approach. It took the eventual winner a
360 spin on the fun-box to snatch the
first-place victory from Danielle’s hands.
A minor disappointment once you con-
sidered the awesome (?) synthetic wallet
awarded for second place (right, Dani-
elle?). As Oli pointed out, at least there
were the free cans of energy drink to
award yourself as you deemed fit.
Straight out of the starting dock, and

Clare Desmet reports
that he wasn’t letting his injured collar
bone or absence of training for the last
two months hold him back. Whilst Gary
showed his ever-present calm under pres-
sure through textbook sliders and switch
skills, it was the flamboyant Tim that
made it through to the final four. Fellow
wakeboarder Antoine described Tim’s
run in the finals as “simply flawless”
and it wasn’t long before he was grin-
ning on top of the podium. And why not,
considering that Tim, 1st place men’s
