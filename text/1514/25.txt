ELECTION PULLOUT
Cora Xydas
B
eing a student trustee
is a great responsibility;
it means having a vote
in the most important
decisions taken by the
Union. From dealing with the budget
to supporting the various depart-
mental unions, the Union trustee
Board does everything. In my view it
is essential that students are repre-
sented by tough people to make the
Union hear their voice. I am commit-
ted to strongly supporting decisions
ensuring
• A fair split of the budget be-
tween under/postgraduates and
postdoctorates
• Greater activity of clubs and so-
cieties in cooperation with UK and
worldwide charities to involve stu-
dents in broader challenges!
• Closer solidarity between students,
a stronger “academic welfare” to
support them in their hard times
and increase student satisfaction!
I believe that I not only have ideas
and strong enough convictions to
make other members of the Board
respect my views, but also that I am
open-minded enough to consider
other opinions and find the best
agreement, as I did as a member
of trustee boards before I joined
Imperial.
As a second year biologist, closely
involved in many of Imperial’s music
and sports societies, I know stu-
dents from all courses and all years,
and discussing my university experi-
ence with them has made me real-
ize what changes ought to be done.
Giving ME a place among the stu-
dent trustees assures you YOUR
points will be heard, because the
reason I’m campaigning is to reach
a position where I can make a
change for you!
So remember : vote for Cora!
Daniel Stoddart
D
o you want someone
who will always listen
to you? Someone who
is not afraid to fight for
your right to be heard?
Someone who will do their best
to make sure that what is done is
what the students want, not what is
easy?
I am that person.
I believe that the Union needs
to be more transparent, more ac-
countable to the student body. We
are still feeling the consequences
of last year’s costly summer ball,
but who is fighting for you, the stu-
dents, to make sure that in saving
the Union’s finances we do not de-
stroy all that is good about it?
I will be open to any suggestion
or idea that students have about
how we can make our Union better.
I will make sure that these ideas are
heard by those in power, and that
those in power know that they must
take these views into account.
The Union is run by the students,
for the students. Vote for me if you
want someone who will fight to
make sure it stays that way, and
make sure you get YOUR say!
Nicolas Massie
T
he Trustee Board had three
broad functions. It over-
sees the Union’s long-term
strategy, it approves BIG
decisions (i.e. things that
could have legal or serious financial
implications) and it is the ultimate
board for appeals against certain de-
cisions. As a member of Union Coun-
cil for three years, Union Executive
Committee for two, and having sat
on Trustee Board as a permanent
observer for this past year as Deputy
President (Welfare) I feel adequately
prepared to provide an informed,
useful and representative voice.
Over the years (this is my sixth
year here) I’ve seen things that
needed doing and done them. As
Social Clubs Committee Chair I in-
creased funding to cash-strapped
clubs and improved the Union’s
online club management system.
As Community Action Group Chair I
pushed for support for student vol-
unteering and we now have a staff
member who works on that full time.
As DP Welfare I spend every day
tackling the issues facing us and
have already achieved five of my
seven manifesto points.
We will soon have to register as a
charity. This is a complex procedure.
I’ve been involved in preparations for
over a year - we need trustees who
know what they’re talking about.
I want to spend one more year
making the Union everything it can
be.
I care about the Union
I care about us
I have the experience to exercise
good judgment
I will stand up for clubs and stu-
dents in a fair trustee board
Vote Massie, your trusty trustee.

Lin (Tracy) and I am a
2nd year Mathemat-

ee of the Student Union.
3 objectives:

student body always come first
when making decisions.
3 ways to make our work more ef-
ficient, transparent and representa-
tive:
• Survey students before the board
making decisions
• Create a database of the commu-
nication between students and the
board
• Annual report on the work we
have done
3 ways to share your ideas and
make complaints:
• Focus groups for students to
share their ideas
• Email contact for students to get
to the board at any time
• Student Opportunities Page on
our website that highlights key op-
portunities which students can get
involved with.
It is your union. Vote for me to
make your voice better heard and
shape the future of the union.
