Reuben Margerison
W
hy should you vote
Reuben for Deputy
President (Welfare)?
Because YOU’RE
worth it.
There are three main points that I
would fight for:
1. Better CCTV
When people think of South Kensing-
ton, they don’t usually think ‘crime’,
but a large number of thefts occur on
campus, and one of the main reasons
that so few of these items are recov-
ered is the poor quality CCTV. There’s
no point in having CCTV if you can’t
see anything! Better quality CCTV is
absolutely necessary around campus,
and something that I would fight for. It
is a great shame that it is not already
in place, to act as a deterrent to all
crimes, including theft and sexual
assault.
2. Fairer Accommodation
Accommodation charges have in-
creased across the whole of Impe-
rial’s halls at a rate way above mar-
ket value. This is especially important
following the tragic announcement of
the closure of Clayponds. If elected, I
promise to fight for the best value ac-
commodation available, for both Post-
graduates and Undergraduates, an
issue which as a hall senior is close
to my heart.
3. Better Catering
Food is a basic requirement, and on
campus there does appear to be a lot
of choice. A closer look, however, re-
veals that the same sandwiches crop
up in every café. A vote for me secures
a look at how we can improve the food
across campus, with exciting and im-
portantly varied menus that cater for
all tastes and dietary requirements.
The future’s bright - the future’s Reu-
ben for Welfare.
Rebecca Lane
M
y name is Rebecca
Lane and I am a
third year physicist.
I have had first-hand
experience of many
of the problems faced by Imperial
students and feel that I can build on
existing welfare policies.
We all know how much of a high
pressure environment Imperial can
be, and I am committed to making
sure that students receive the high-
est possible level of pastoral care
across every department. There
needs to be an effective feedback
mechanism regarding personal tu-
tors and there should be staff in
every department committed to
student wellbeing. I think there also
needs to be a more uniform peer
support service from department
to department. Some faculties have
buddy systems; I think there needs
to be a robust model rolled out
throughout college.
Aside from departmental pastoral
care, I will campaign to further in-
crease the resources of the Student
Counselling Service, meaning any
student feeling isolated gets help
as promptly as possible. I will also
raise awareness about help avail-
able to students to reduce the stig-
ma attached to asking for support.
I will also campaign to find a so-
lution to the lack of bike storage,
to provide basic bike tools in all
lock-ups and continue to rally for a
prepay top-up college card system
for purchasing food on campus.
As a third year student, I feel that
I have the experience to represent
undergraduates, but also the level
of maturity to represent the voice of
postgraduates at Imperial.
Support my welfare campaign,
vote for Rebecca Lane.
Jack Hewitt
F
or the last year, as RAG
chair, I’ve chaired a man-
agement group of projects,
represented them at the
Clubs and Societies Board,
and been an active member of Union
Council. I’ve chaired the New Proj-
ects Committee (overseeing the cre-
ation of new student-run projects),
written for Felix regularly, organised
metric nights, a successful Jailbreak,
bike auctions with the current DPW,
worked with all the Sabbatical Offi-
cers and Faculty Unions, significantly
reduced RSMU’s storage issues and
sat on the Entertainments Commit-
tee. I’m both very experienced and
committed to the cause, having
faced massive problems with hous-
ing and as an international applicant
who’d been to London twice before
uni.
If elected I will-
- Provide a housing guide giving
information on basic housing law,
contracts and a blacklist of landlords
and estate agents known to mistreat
students.
- Hold an alternative careers fair,
giving a different look at employment
- Hold termly hall meetings, in every
hall, to stay connected with Freshers
and the problems they face
- Make Smoking Quit-Kits readily
available to students
- Hold monthly ‘Sabbatical Surger-
ies’ - Ensure buddies are assigned
before Freshers’ week, especially for
International Students
- Write regularly for Felix about the
Union, how it works and what it can
do for you
- Set up a gym buddy system for the
gyms on all campuses, both for Halls
and course-mates
- Reinvigorate Imperial Home Solu-
tions to get more on there, photos
and floorplans
- Provide a list of student discounts
on the Union Website and in pre-arriv-
al information, and budgeting advice
Binayak Basnyat
C
ourse: 3rd year Computing.
Project Leader of volun-
teering group Project Ne-
pal, IC Football team and
Department of Computing
Society.
Having spent the past three years at
Imperial, I have had my share of prob-
lems. The welfare system has helped
me get through the intensive course
that all of us face. This has strength-
ened my belief to stand up for this
position to improve the system where
needed and take new initiatives to in-
troduce preventive measures so that
everyone can have an overall enjoy-
able experience.
“Departmental Responsibility for Stu-
dent Welfare”
Leaflets and posters are not enough.
- Senior tutors to chase up students
lagging behind which could be a result
of various issues other than academ-
ic. All students come here with 3 or
more A’s and there should be no ex-
cuse for lagging behind.
“More Volunteering Opportunities”
Volunteering can be one of the most
rewarding ways to make a difference
in local or international communities.
I want to:
- Make it easier for students to initi-
ate new volunteering societies. (From
few months to 2 weeks)
- Build new partnerships with volun-
teering organisations to fast track our
students.
- Promote new opportunities avail-
able via dedicated website.
- Organise charity fundraising sports
tournaments.
“Tackle academic issues as preven-
tive measures”
- Reading week for every course.
- Scrapping midnight deadline. (You
will still receive equal expected work-
ing hours for completion of each
coursework but you don’t have to skip
social activities.)
- Recorded lectures.
- Term Exams instead of all exams
in May.
