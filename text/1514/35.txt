Today your diary entry will read: “took a
prozzie hostage and was shot by three armed
bastards!”
My name is Alex Drake, I’ve just been shot and
that bullet has sent me back to 1981. I may be
one second away from life, or one second away
from death. All I know is that I have to keep
fighting: fight to live, fight to see my daughter,
fight to get home.
Alex Drake (the smoking hot Keeley Hawes)
is a trained police psychologist and negotia-
tor who has recently been researching the case
of Sam Tyler, an officer who claimed to have
been sent back to 1973 after being hit by a car
in 2006.
In the first two of the five series (Life On
Mars), Tyler was in a coma for some time after
the car accident. On regaining consciousness,
his accounts of DI Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister),
DS Ray Carling (Dean Andrews) and DC Chris
Skelton (Marshall Lancaster) were dismissed as
fantasy, but for Alex, it’s all about to get very
real.
Lured into a disused
shipping container by
a seemingly mentally
afflicted man with
a revolver, Alex
is shot in the
head and wakes
up to find her-
self in a brothel
(and dressed as a
top-class prosti-
tute, phwoaar)... in
1981. The red
Audi Quat-
tro comes screeching
to a halt and out steps DCI
Gene Hunt. Screw forms and
bureaucracy, Gene is a cop-
per from the good old days of gut i n -
stinct and steel-toecap boots. Alex Drake is his
new DI.
Over three series (and twenty-four one-hour
episodes) as the team
punch, kick, shoot
(and subject to
psychoanalysis)
most of Lon-
don’s crimi-
nal low-life
scum, Alex
and Gene de-
velop some-
thing of a
l o v e - h a t e
relationship
with each oth-
er. But is
Alex still
alive?
At the
end of
s e r i e s
two, Alex
wakes up
in 2008, having
accidentally been shot
by Gene during the foiling of
a group of corrupt officers – but there’s
no bullet wound on her forehead. Is she dead?
When she returns, it’s 1983 and the increasing
bureaucracy in the force arrives in the shape of
DCI Jim Keats (Daniel Mays) – there to investi-
gate Gene’s conduct.
The exquisite aura of evil which manifests it-
self around Keats is of Rickmanian proportions,
which, combined with his fantastic socially-
awkward deport-
ment, is more
scary than

the whole of The Woman in Black. All of which
is rather fitting, but we’re already far enough
into spoiler territory!
All in all, Ashes is brilliantly thought out and
some of Gene Hunt’s witty quips will have peo-
ple surrounded by armed bastards and firing up
imaginary Quattros (or should that be Quattri?)
for some time to come. Watch it!
