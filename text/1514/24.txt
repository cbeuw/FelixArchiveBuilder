ELECTION PULLOUT
4
Lejon Chua
T
he call to becoming a stu-
dent trustee requires utmost
integrity and prudence. I be-
lieve strongly that my past
experiences have shaped
these two cardinal values in me and
empowered me to want to commit to
the few yet highly crucial roles that a
student trustee undertakes.
Previous Experiences:
1) Armoured-Infantry Platoon Com-
mander in the Singapore Armed
Forces. Responsible for the lives of
30 men under my charge and charting
directions and plans for the unit as a
whole.
2) Took on a professional multifaceted
role in TUV SUD, a german certifica-
tion company (i.e. admin, laboratory,
on-site).
Motivations:
1) ICL has a highly international com-
munity. Yet, year after year, there is
a lack of international representation
within the union. I desire to be the
unique international voice as part of
the independent body within the union,
spurring constructive changes that
would affect the larger community.
2) Having relished the university expe-
rience that the ICL and its community
has granted me thus far, I want to fur-
ther enhance it for others in a position
that draws the most out of my abili-
ties and attributes. In particular, the
job of a student trustee fits my driven,
shrewd yet stolid nature and my keen
interest to provide checks and bal-
ances pertaining to finances. It also
taps on the key strengths I possess
as follows:
a) A calm confidence to be able to size
things up within a short time, make
sound judgements and decisions that
would impact at the large scale, yet
possessing a ...[word limit reached]

W
hy should anybody
vote for me as a Stu-
dent Trustee? Well,
that is a good ques-
tion and I will answer
that at the end.
But first I thank every one of you
reading this manifesto this instant
because it means so much to me
that you are. Not only that you all
are thinking about who to vote for,
you all care where your votes go to.
So I stayed up all night, for days,
thinking about what to write here so
that you all get an accurate descrip-
tion of who I am.
I am a fresher (like 1500 others
here), studying computing (like 150
others here). I am also an Asian
(like 100000 here) specifically Ko-
rean (like 100 others here), but
what distinguishes me is that I want
this Student Trustee more than any-
one and I know I can do this.
Do you have what it takes? Some
people ask me. Do I have what it
takes? I ask myself sometimes. I
know that I am not perfect. I know
this and you have all the right to
criticize me for who I am not. But at
the same time, acknowledge me for
who I am.
If you vote for me, I promise you
that I will do all I can to make the
Imperial College Union better, more
enjoyable place for all of you. With
what I have, for better or worse, I
will try my best.
Nathaniel Bottrell
H
ello! I started Imperial
in 2004 and next year
will be my final year as
a PhD student. This year
I am a student trustee.
If elected for a second term, I know
I can serve the union’s major stake-
holder, YOU, with the confidence the
role deserves.
I believe a student trustee should
have a good understanding of the
union, and I do. I have held a num-
ber of positions in a variety of roles,
which include Treasurer and Presi-
dent of two clubs, and chair of the
Recreational Clubs Committee (a
Management Group of the union).
As RCC Chair, I sat on both Coun-
cil and Exec, which has given me
a great understanding of the union
(including knowing the constitution).
A vote for me, is a vote for experi-
ence.
The union is undergoing a major
change, one of which students may
not know about. The union is apply-
ing for charity registration and by
law is required to register with the
Charity Commission. Having already
served a term as a student trustee,
I have the background knowledge to
put forward an opinion from the stu-
dent’s perspective. Vote for me to
keep continuity through the charity
registration process.
The 5 year strategic review, start-
ed last year and reviewed at the
last trustee board meeting, is soon
to be published. If elected, I would
ensure the targets set by this docu-
ment are met by the union. Vote for
me to ensure the union remains on
target.
Hitesh Hassani Chandershekh
H
ola Que pasa! I’m a
Spindian (Spanish-Indi-
an) ChemEng guy and I
want to be your Student
Trustee.
The most important part of a uni-
versity is its students, and it is my
belief that students should have
a greater say in decision making
within the college and union, I be-
lieve your voice must be heard! The
governing board of the union needs
someone who is not afraid of step-
ping outside the boundaries in or-
der to do what is right for you; I am
the person.
I will always strive to support stu-
dents in whichever which way I can
and I assure you that if I were elect-
ed I would wholeheartedly bring for-
ward your ideas and relay these to
the governing body so that all stu-
dent needs and desires are met.
I believe that students matter and
I feel that this simple truth is some-
time forgotten at Imperial College. If
elected I will guarantee that this will
not be the case.
So to make your voices heard;
Vote Hitesh Hassani for Student
Trustee!
