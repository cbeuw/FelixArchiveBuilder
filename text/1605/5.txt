Student Academic Choice Award
winners announced
The Imperial College Union
Student Academic Choice
Awards (SACAs) award
ceremony took place on Monday
evening at the Union Concert Hall.
Eight awards were featured that
evening, with six shortlisted members
of staff per award.
The SACAs, now in their third year,
were set up to recognise staff for their
contributions to education and the
student experience at the College.
The evening was presented by Pascal
Loose, Deputy President (Education),
who said: “The aim of the SACAs is
for the students to say thank you to
the academics and the staff, thank
you for being such a great teacher,
thank you for giving so much support
and for inspiring those they teach
every day.”
808 nominations were received
from 568 students when nominations
opened in November on the
Union’s website, making that the
highest number to date. The
nominee shortlist was curated by
a judging panel of various student
representatives, before deciding on an
eventual winner.
The award for Best Teaching for
Undergraduates went to Dr Steven
Cook from the Department of Life
Sciences. He told Felix that he was
“so grateful to all those students who
nominated me for this award, and
to all those colleagues and friends
without whose support I couldn’t
teach at all. I’m also very grateful that
I was allowed off the stage before Ben
the cameraman could capture my
Paltrow-esque blubbing for posterity.
Thank you!”
Best Teaching for Postgraduates
was awarded to Dr Mick Jones from
the Department of Medicine, who
is also one of four College Tutors.
“The award was a bit of a shock, but
a very nice one. The Mol Med MSc
is a fairly small course compared to
some other Masters programmes in
College and I really do feel honoured
by the students’ support. I see every
year how hard the students work on
the course, their enthusiasm, their
determination to succeed, and that
makes me do the best I can for them.
Also, there’s the fact that I haven’t
really stopped being a ‘student’
myself!”
The award for Best Innovation
went to Dr Elizabeth Hauke from the
Centre of Co-curricular Studies, who
teaches both Science Communication
and Horizons courses. She said that
she “was very moved to receive
my nomination, and grateful to
the students that took the time to
nominate me. This award is very
special as it recognises a course
that was designed to be delivered
in partnership with students, thus
allowing them to make decisions
about their learning. It has been
amazing working on this course
with the students this year, and I
have learned a massive amount from
them. Massive thanks to the Union
for all their hard work organising
and coordinating these awards – and
for their extremely professional
presentation of the awards at the
ceremony.
Claudia Schulz from the
Department of Computing took
home the award for Best Graduate
Teaching Assistant. “The only thing
I could initially say when being
presented with the award was ‘wow,
I really didn’t expect this.’ It was an
absolutely overwhelming moment
and I am most grateful to the
students who nominated me. I love
teaching and genuinely care about
my students; seeing that the thought
and effort put into my teaching is
appreciated by students is invaluable.
All nominees for Best GTA were
passionate about their teaching, and
their students highly appreciated
this - so really all of them are winners
too!”
Best Tutoring went to Martin
Holloway from the Department
of Bioengineering, who was also
a shortlisted nominee in the first
SACAs (2013) for Best Support
Staff. He described it as a particular
honor to receive this award, “as it
is based on student nominations.
I find it genuinely rewarding to
help students overcome anything
that gets in the way of their studies,
and my door is always open in the
hope that a student will help me
avoid having to do spreadsheets.”
Aside from tutoring, students in the
department who nominated him
were also full of praise for his “quirky
sense of humour that he brings to
lectures, or his significant talent in
the department as a drummer and
goalkeeper.”
The award for Best Feedback was
presented to Dr Paul Mitcheson from
EEE, who was unable to attend the
ceremony; Professor Peter Cheung,
the Head of Department, collected
it on his behalf. Students lauded his
mentality on strict feedback cycles
and the importance of continual
feedback, praising his contributions
as third year course organizer.
Speaking to Felix, Dr Mitcheson said:
“We restructured the third year of
EEE to accommodate industrial
placements and to introduce more
practical engineering via all-
coursework lab-based courses to
further enable students to develop a
passion for applying theory to real
engineering problems. This method
of teaching relies on high quality and
timely feedback - and it is rewarding
to see the students highlighting the
work of myself and colleagues in
achieving this goal.”
Anup Jethwa from the Department
of Medicine, based at Northwick Park
Hospital, received the Best Support
Staff award. She describes herself
as being “thrilled that I have been
recognised by the students for this
award”, and praised the event as being
well organised.
Best Supervision was awarded to
Dr John Pinney from Life Sciences,
who told Felix how the long journey
of a PhD can be tough going at times.

Carol Ann Cheah finds out which staff get the student’s vote
"I find it
genuinely
rewarding
to help
students
overcome
anything
that gets
in the way
of their
studies"
"I really
do feel
honoured
by the
students’
support"
I do my best to encourage a positive
working environment within the
research group. I think it is important
to be there to challenge when needed
and to give individual support
throughout the PhD programme,
bearing in mind that every student
will have different needs and
expectations.”
Closing the event with a speech,
Professor James Stirling, Provost of
Imperial College London said: “This
evening we have seen some wonderful
examples of great practice. Our task
now will be, with your help, to spread
this great practice right across the
College so that together we can create
a community of people with the
passion, ability and commitment
to secure our position as one of the
world’s great universities.”
“The SACAs are not only an
important event in Imperial
College Union’s annual calendar;
they are an important event in the
College’s calendar too... I would like
to personally congratulate all the
nominees for tonight’s awards and
particularly, of course, the winners.”
