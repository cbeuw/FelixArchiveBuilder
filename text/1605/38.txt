success. Additionally, Isaac reached
the milestone of 100 jumps, which
was celebrated in fitting style with
what can only be described as aerial
chaos (involving a Power Rangers
morphsuit, a potato and a “hotdog-in-
a-blender” configuration).
After Hassan had popped off for
breakfast, our AFF students were
going to get their morning refresher
briefing, before doing their first
jump! All of our beginners got 3
jumps in this day! Day two was also
trip officer José’s birthday! He forgot
all about it though, as he was too busy
jumping (we reminded him later on
in the bar).

Askydiver’s greatest enemy,
especially in the UK, is
inclement weather. So for
the first ever international tour of
IC Skydiving we followed the sun
to Skydive Algarve in Portugal,
which like our own club has recently
expanded to new levels of successful
operation with the acquirement of a
new plane and procurement of a new
team of world expert instructors and
dropzone managers.
The dropzone was nice enough to
even provide us with discount rates
for both beginner AFF (Accelerated
FreeFall) courses (300€ off a 1800€
course) and individual jumps (28€
instead of 30€) for our licensed
members.
Of course, while the main
intention of the trip was to improve
our skydiving skills and get
people progressing through their
qualifications, we started the trip with
a day of sightseeing in Lisbon to get
our bearings and get to know each
other, apart from novice member
Hassan starting off a trip tradition
of wandering off and disappearing at
crucial moments.
However, once he’d gone on treks
for swimming shorts, socks and
chewing gum, we headed south to
the dropzone. It was jump after jump
for every member, and most nights
ended with exhausted skydivers
passing out by the house pool
after dinner. Trip officer José even
managed to miss his birthday – too
busy jumping!
Along with a regular core of club
jumpers, we were accompanied by a
small number of guests of the club
– namely, two alumni who could
provide assistance and training, for
no cost, in things like formation
skydiving and license progression,
and four members of our allied
skydiving club at the University of
London, including their current and
future presidents, solidifying our
growing partnership.
We were all super sad to say
goodbye to the dropzone and all the
skydivers. We could have been sadder
though, as we’d had beautiful weather
almost all week and the forecast for
the following week was atrocious. So
the schadenfreude kept us all a bit
happier.
By the conclusion of the trip, 5
people had earnt their A license,
everyone had rapidly growing jump
numbers by everyone and we had
participated in the first official team
training jump in Imperial history!

Arrival in Lisbon
We landed in Lisbon at lunchtime,
before checking-in to a hostel in the
“nightlife” district. Guided by locals,
we had a traditional Portuguese meal
followed by a night on the town,
where everyone properly got to know
each other and formed a convivial
spirit that would be carried forwards
through the rest of the trip. After a
late breakfast of the world-famous
Portuguese pastry, Pasteis de Nata,
we drove 4 hours south in convoy,
to move in to our shared villa in the
Algarve, only 15 minutes’ drive from
the dropzone.
José enforced a tour playlist of garage
and dubstep music in his car, and
Lucy Marriott went from detesting
the genres at the beginning of the trip,
to aggressively demanding them after
a couple of days. Pippa countered by
playing rock and metal in her car,
while Isaac’s car had Tchaikovsky and
Debussy.
The group was pressed for time
to finish breakfast and get to the
airport to collect the hire cars when
we realised that Hassan had wandered
off to find swimming shorts. He
ended up buying socks. Later, at the
airport, he disappeared again to find
gum, starting a tradition that would
continue throughout the trip.
In the Algarve, after the boring but
necessary registration process, and
with the day’sjumping finished before
we could get there, a barbeque feast
was provided by the group’s more
culinary members, followed by an
early night, ready for a week of non-
stop skydiving.
Hitting the dropzone
The five student skydivers spent the
first day doing their intensive ground
school training, while some of the
experienced members got a taste of
the incredible things the dropzone
had to offer by landing on the beach,
at sunset!
Many milestones were reached
on the second day.with Jonny
successfully completing his
formation rating, the first team jump
ever in Imperial College Skydiving’s
history was completed with great
