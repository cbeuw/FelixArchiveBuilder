Social media has driven Conservatives to keep their views quiet

“Well
done Great
Britain,
Another
five years of
oppression!”
The General Election has come
and gone, and the United
Kingdom has democratically
elected the Conservative Party into
power for the next five years. 36.9% of
the country voted for them, but if you
look at the articles being plastered all
over the internet and social media,
you would have no idea that this was
the case.
The Felix poll suggested that 35%
of Imperial students were planning
to vote Conservative. I’ve spoken to
a lot of people about this election,
and only one person has admitted to
me that they voted Tory. But, they
added as a caveat, it was because the
Conservative MP in their Fulham
consistency was really good. In
Hammersmith, they told me, they
would have voted Labour.
And this is at Imperial. It’s no secret
that Imperial is one of the more
conservative universities. Imperial
was one of the only universities
whose student union did not protest
against the tuition fee rises, going
so far as to voice support for them.
The students themselves largely let
the marches pass them by, probably
out of a combination of apathy and
right-wingedness. Although my
only impression of the Imperial
Conservative Society has been
watching from the next stand at
Fresher’s Fair as many people came
along and bitched them out, we
didn’t even have a Liberal Democrat
counterpart until recently.
I grew up in a part of Wales where
the Labour-Conservative battle
seems very distant. Each of these
parties takes no more than around
10% of the vote, with the remaining
fight being between the Lib Dems
and Plaid Cymru; voting Labour or
Conservative is not a done thing. I
remember in the 2010 election, as a
second year Imperial student, I was
surprised to find my friends were
extremely vocal in their support of
Labour. For me, the young person’s
party was the Liberal Democrats, and
it didn’t occur to me that you would
vote for anyone else. In this election,
it’s been a bit different. Obviously the
Lib Dems have fallen out of favour,
but I’m again surprised at how much
everyone seems to have picked up
Labour as their go-to party.
I watched the results of the General
Election with a group of people
from Imperial who all had different
political ideas. One classed himself
as a Conservative (but he voted Lib
Dem, I’m not really sure how that
works), some others still hopefully
carried the Lib Dem banner, several
were die-hard Labour, and one person
voted Green. No one admitted to
any support of the Conservatives,
but given the general reaction to
such confessions on social media, I
wouldn’t admit it either.
I’ve seen people be torn to shreds
for suggesting that rich people
probably pay a bit more tax than poor
people, I’ve seen statuses like, OMG
all Tories unfriend me, Well done
Great Britain, Another five years of
oppression! Shops have displayed
signs suggesting that Conservative
voters should declare themselves
and pay more tax. There have been
protests and riots outside Whitehall.
But this isn’t a few hard-right EDL
or BNP supporters they’re protesting
against here, it’s the largest single
group of supporters in the country.
Some people I’m friends with on
Facebook have been organising
demonstrations against the current
method of democratic selection.
Under the first past the post system,
everyone knows how it works, and
votes accordingly. Under a different
system, who knows if people would
vote the same way? It’s true that FPTP
has its flaws, but all the left-wing
advocates of a more proportional
representation seem to have forgotten
that this would give us 82 UKIP MPs
(if we kept the number of seats the
same), and actually the “right-wing”
Tories plus UKIP would still have
about the same proportion.
Labour would lose seats, and we
would have a much more fractured
government. The Greens and Lib
Dems would gain seats, of course, but
at what cost? We would have a more
liberal representation in Parliament,
for sure, but what is going to be passed
under that parliament? Surely true
proportional representation, and the
government that would result from
other voting systems, will only lead to
the passing of bills to be slowed and
dragged out. This might prevent some
really stupid things from happening
– I think we can all agree that we
want to keep the death penalty in
the past and stay in the EU – but this
might also prevent good things from
happening, like the legalisation of gay
marriage.
My News Feed is absolutely
plastered with articles about how
the entire country is going to go to
the dogs now we have a majority
Conservative government, how all the
poor people are going to starve/suffer/
commit suicide, and how every single
person who voted Tory is an awful
selfish human being who only cares
about themself and their aspirational
ideas of moving up the class system.
Surely this can’t be true, a group that
is nearly half the country must be
diverse, and the policies which drew
them must have some appeal.
I’ve seen articles about the rise of
the ‘shy Tories’, who apparently hate
themselves and are ashamed to admit
their greedy, self-centred leanings.
Charlie Brooker has compared voting
Conservative to masturbating – you
probably do it, but you definitely
don’t talk about it. But is it because
people are just shy and embarrassed,
or has the barrage of self-righteous
hate driven them to keep their views
to themselves for self-preservation?
Has being a Conservative voter
become the ultimate taboo in our life
of first world problems?
Or is all of this Facebook’s fault?
It’s no secret that Facebook curates
your News Feed, showing you exactly
what they want you to see, based on
interactions you’ve made with other
posts. Even just hovering over an
anti-Tory article while you read the
headline might be enough to make
Facebook think that you want to see
more, and so you’re eventually hit
with more posts than you can read
about how the Conservative agenda
is evil, demonising the poor, disabled
and mentally ill. Maybe there are
other posts on social media, you’re
just not being shown them. Perhaps
your social circle isn’t actually quite
so homogenously angry lefties.
Unfortunately, this social media
censorship only feeds into the
impression that the parliament
is unrepresentative, and drives
discontent and frustration among
those who are not in support of the
elected government, who feel their
voices aren’t being heard.
Ultimately, we have the
government that we voted for under
the system that we knew about going
into the polling booths. It can’t be
the case that everyone is happy with
the result, but there is no denying
that it represents the electorate in
the way it was designed to. While you
may disagree with the way people
have voted, the angry holier-than-
thou attitude is attacking a huge
proportion of the country, and
serves no purpose in improving this
country. For this country to drift
back to the centre, which – for the
better or worse – I have no doubt
that it will, more people need to be
on board with their policies, and
this isn’t going to happen if the
current supporters of these ideas
are constantly berating them and
denouncing them as reprobate and
loathsome.
“Or is all
of this
Facebook’s
fault?”
