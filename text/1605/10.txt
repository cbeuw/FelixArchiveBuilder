Joshua Renken interviews the Labour MP who is representing
your views in Hammersmith
“I think the Liberal Democrats behaved
totally dishonestly and they’ve got
exactly what they deserved.”
The Labour politician Andy
Slaughter was elected as
Member of Parliament for
Hammersmith in 2010, and was re-
elected last week with 50% of the vote.
Previously the MP for Ealing, Acton
and Shephard’s Bush from 2005 to
2010, Slaughter has been the Shadow
Justice Minister since 2010, serving
on the Labour Party’s front bench.
Joshua Renken interviewed Andy to
talk about constituency matters and
national politics.
Joshua Renken: What are
your priorities over the next
parliament for your Hammersmith
constituents?
Andy Slaughter: There are a lot of
issues which I wish to get help with
and they are issues like the proposed
demolition of Charing Cross
hospital, the development of the
HS2 site which is one of the biggest
development sites in London, and
others.
It also looks far more likely that
we’ll get a third runway at Heathrow,
which we are opposed to.
Those issues are campaigning issues
which are not new issues, but which
we hope to have a more positive
outcome because we can spend more
time campaigning on them. That’s the
defensive side if you like.
On the positive side, there is a
limited amount that you can do as
an opposition MP without support,
but I do have support from the local
Labour council. The Tories are now
saying they’ll devolve powers and
budgets a lot more to cities like
Manchester and devolve the health
budget.
JR: What do you think of
Osborne’s city devolution plan for
England?
AS: I’m suspicious of their motives
but I think the principle of it is
perfectly sound. If the Tories are
only going to do it to fragment the
NHS and slip in privatisation, which
they want to do, then I oppose it.
If however they were genuinely
devolving power and budgets to a
local and regional level then that’s
a thing we would support, so long as
you don’t get that postcode lottery
effect. If they are going to end up
giving more money to the east shires
and less to inner city areas then that
is something we have got to watch.
But the principle of it is perfectly
sound, and if they are prepared to
do that with London, it gives us
an opportunity to argue for more
sympathetic environment for what
the health needs are.
JR: Do you think Labour were too
leftwing or not leftwing enough to
win this general election?
AS: I think that’s not just a stupid
question, but it’s a really pointless
question. I think Labour put forward
a series of sensible policies but there
was a lot of misrepresentation. I’ve
never seen a campaign in which
either the party leader Ed Miliband
was vilified so much by the majority
of the press who were very keen to
secure another Tory victory, or a
campaign where there was so much
misrepresentation of policies. So
if you look at the sort of policies
that were supposedly left-wing like
implementing a price freeze or
getting rid of zero-hours contracts
and raising the minimum wage.
They are pretty mainstream social
democratic policies.
JR: Before the decision about
the timeframe of the Labour
leadership race was made, did you
favour a quick leadership race or a
slower, more introspective one?
AS: I think there were three options
and I was very much against the
longer option that would have
stretched it out into the autumn. But
I don’t think there is much material
difference. The only disadvantage of
going slightly longer is that you don’t
have the sort of new team. You have a
sort of transitional team in place and
I think people were concerned about
that. In reality it’s a decision between
making the decision at the end of July
or the middle of September, which is
would be two weeks into parliament
sitting time. But I don’t think it
makes much difference to be honest.
JR: As Shadow Minister for Justice,
what are your thoughts on Michael
Gove’s plans to replace the Human
Rights Act?
AS: Well that’s just abhorrent really.
I think the only positive thing is that
it’s already running into difficulties.
The Scottish government has said
that they won’t do it. There are equal
issues with Northern Ireland, in
terms that they will have to find an
agreement. But they are issues to do
with the European convention itself.
This is something that the Tories
have said as a crowd pleaser to certain
constituencies but particularly their
own back benchers, that I think
they’ll have great difficulty doing.
Either it will be a cosmetic thing,
i.e. they’ll call it something like the
British Bill of Rights but effectively
they’ll have to keep it the same, much
as they are. Or, they will be trying to
make a fundamental change, in which
case, effectively they’ll have to leave
the convention and I don’t think
that’s really sustainable so I think
there a huge difficulties.
JR: Do you think, if the EU
referendum goes ahead, that the
UK electorate will vote to leave?
AS: No, and I don’t think that’s what
Cameron wants either. He will try and
manipulate it. I’ve always thought
this was just about managing the
Conservative party.
He might find it slightly easier now
that he’s got a majority but I think
there are enough headbangers who
will cause him problems, but I’ve
never had much doubt that Cameron
himself and the leadership of the
party do want to stay in, and then
you’ve got the leadership of most of
the main parties. It will probably be a
re-run of what happened in 74 where
it will be a closely fought campaign
but I think that the majority of the
opinion will then be for staying in.
JR: Do you believe that Nick Clegg
put country before party during
the coalition talks in 2010? Was he
right to go into coalition with the
Tories?
AS: I think the Liberal Democrats
behaved totally dishonestly and
they’ve got exactly what they
deserved. I was in the 2005-2010
parliament when they positioned
themselves to the left of Labour, their
economic policy gains in that election
was broadly the same as Labour’s,
and then within 24 hours they
effectively said “No, no we support
the full on austerity that Osbourne is
advocating.”
I think there’s never been a political
U-turn of that order and that’s before
we get to issues like tuition fees. So
no, I think they put self-interest and
Clegg and the other right-wingers in
the Liberal Democrats managed to
carry the day and they’ve got what
they deserved.People are very cynical
of politicians I think, partly because
of this sort of behaviour. In reality,
there has to be certain standards and
I think Clegg fell well below those
standards.
JR: Do you believe in free
education?
AS: In an ideal world yes, but I don’t
think that it’s sustainable anymore.
JR: So what is the magic number?
AS: Well the magic number for us
was £6000 a year. It really is the
difference between when 5-10% of
people went to University and when
it’s approaching 50%, and then asking
the 50% of the population who don’t
go to heavily subsidise those do go.
So there has to be some payment
I’m afraid. I wish it wasn’t the case
because I do value free education,
it’s just that you’ve got so many
people going to University, which is a
good thing, but there has to be some
payment back.
Graduates do earn more money
overall, but I do think it could have
been fairer and the debt is too high
overall. There was a lot of pressure on
us not reducing tuition fees, but we
are always going to be talking about
It also
looks far
more likely
that we’ll
get a third
runway at
Heathrow
We are
quite
likely to
see an
attack
on civil
liberties
