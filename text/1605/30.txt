Support for the Supporters
This is the mental health
awareness week and I’ll focus
on a slightly different but
related angle today. In welfare,
mental health is a much discussed
issue with ever-increasing helpful
resources, but there is a group of
people often left out from the media
spotlight. These are the friends who
support friends with eating disorders,
those in relationships who lighten up
their partner’s depression, or parents
who calm their child with anxiety, to
name a few examples.
Considerate friends and family
make every effort to understand
and accommodate their loved ones
with mental conditions. Unlike
professional supporters, they often
have little to no training themselves,
willing to learn by patient trial-and-
error, consulting online forums or
call centres, just so they can help their
loved ones however they can.
It’s not easy and can be quite
taxing for the friends and family.
Outsiders might think it’s simply
about “listening” and “being there”
for those who need it. But that’s a
huge over-simplification; mental
conditions aren’t like “feeling down”
where a good heart-to-heart talk
can fix everything. It’s a sustained
commitment, helping the sufferer
through the ups and downs of the
condition, trying to be understanding
even when they don’t quite
understand what’s asked from them.
Especially as friends and family, they
know that their loved ones rely on
them.
So to help the supporters, I’ve
compiled a list of tips and things
to bear in mind in order to make it
easier.
It’s not you, it’s not me
Sometimes, supporters can be hurt by
what their loved ones say during their
phase. For depression, the sufferer
might go silent for days until you
think that you’ve done something
wrong. During an anxiety attack,
they might burst out with insensitive
accusations because they’re feeling
overwhelmed by their emotions.
What makes it particularly sting is
because they’re so unlike their usual
character.
You should understand that this is
the condition talking, not them. And
don’t feel guilty too because it’s not
your fault. The sufferer will often
come to their loved ones to apologise
after the phase, for it is never their
intention to hurt the people they
also love (perhaps even more than
themselves in the worst of times).
Depression, anxiety and bipolar
disorder cloud the mind, crippling it
with hopeless or a rush of thoughts
that couldn’t be turned off. Even
subtler conditions such as eating
disorders can plant doubts and false
assumptions in your head, making
it feel like it’s the most obvious
truth. They’ve got their hands full
to overflowing dealing with the
thoughts in their head.
Therefore, distancing yourself
from the disruptive condition might
be the best way to prevent yourself
from getting hurt when trying to
help. It can be as simple as attributing
the hurtful things said to the illness
itself, trying not to get your feelings
involved as you comfort them. By
doing this, you don’t care less about
them. In fact, it makes you a more
effective supporter, because you’ll
focus on the issue at hand.
Know that they are suffering
Going through the lows of the illness
is not something they’d choose to
feel if they could help it. They are in
the grips of their thoughts, driven on
by the condition, and it is a horrible
feeling that they can’t control.
As you support your friends
or family members, it helps to
remember that it is not a choice
or overreaction, but something
involuntary. Sometimes, they would
communicate that they need help
with it when it is too much for them
to bear alone, but sometimes it is
possible that the sufferer prefers to
stay quiet and cope with it themselves
so it wouldn’t become worse.
Regardless, I want to remind you
that by sharing their vulnerabilities
and suffering, they are placing a
lot of trust on you on a sensitive
topic, which shows how much they
appreciate you.
It will pass
Mental illnesses usually come in
phases. For example, depression
oscillates between normal and relapse
periods. For some people, these occur
every week for a few days at a time.
For others, they last for weeks but
occur only once every few months.
As someone close to the sufferer,
you’ll know this better than most or
begin to notice patterns that aren’t
yet confirmed. So even when you feel
worn down, do remember that it is
not always this way.
Don’t let it define your
relationship
There’s a misconception about living
with people with mental illness
where it’s believed that the supporter
has to spend all of his or her time
supporting the sufferer. This is far
from the truth, as you’ll probably
realise from the ‘it will pass’ section.
It will only be a small part of the
relationship, such as how a couple

and resources
where one person is suffering from
depression can hang out and travel
just as much as everyone else, and
is in need of support every once in
a while. Sure, you might not be able
to do certain things when one is
suffering an episode, but the intimate
understanding and trust make the
relationship special in its own way.
Plus, despite the fact that these
conditions stay with a person
throughout their lives, things don’t
always have to be the way it currently
is. Loved ones can significantly help
in developing mechanisms that helps
sufferers to cope. As they are familiar
with the onset, they can remind the
sufferer that a phase is coming in so
they can stop the onset of an anxiety
attack before it spirals out of control.
It will be a constant fight against this
illness, but you both can get better at
beating it.
I hope the tips are helpful to the
kind friends and family supporting
their loved ones through their
personal struggle.
If you have specific questions, there
are a lot of guides available online
that are geared towards supporters
More importantly, the call centres
listed on the side can also be helpful
for the supporters as well as sufferers.
Remember that people on the other
end of the phone are also supporters.
It’s their job. So they could truly
understand and sympathise what
you’re going through.
