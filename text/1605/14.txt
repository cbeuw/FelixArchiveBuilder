Cecily Johnson doesn’t want to set a precedent of censorship
On continuing to Keep the Cat Free
Last weekend, the College played
host to 15,000 guests at this
year’s Imperial Festival. With
alumni events running alongside,
the festival seeks to raise Imperial’s
profile by dragging its scientists and
engineers out of the laboratory to
share their research with the public.
But this year, one regular campus
fixture wasn’t being presented to
the ImpFest audience: the student
newspaper, Felix.
Unfortunately, our front cover
last week featured the story of Nur
Fitri Azmeer Nordin, a former third
year mathematics student who was
recently convicted of making and
distributing child pornography.
Subsequently, the Imperial College
Communications and Public Affairs
division (Comms) made the decision
to remove all copies of Felix from
public access for the duration of the
festival, after we’d already distributed
the paper around campus.
The Felix team was able to
compromise and move some Felix
distribution bins inside the Central
Library in the hope that some
students would still be able to access
the paper. However, against our
wishes, Imperial Estates Facilities
employees were sent to remove the
papers before the end of the day,
meaning that large numbers of
students leaving lectures, labs and
tutorials after this time were unable
to access copies of Felix.
When initially informing Felix of
their decision, Comms indicated that
they did not think our front cover
was suitable for children; they later
cited fears that they might receive
complaints from parents attending
the festival if the papers remained
accessible. However, it is my feeling
that there was nothing on the cover
that children couldn’t potentially see
any time they walk past a newsagents
or glance at a television showing the
evening news.
Since the limited distribution was
announced, the question of whether
it amounts to censorship has been a
hot topic in the Felix office. A quick
Google tells us that the definition
of censorship is “the suppression
of speech, public communication
or other information which may
be considered harmful, sensitive...
or inconvenient, as determined by
governments... authorities or other
groups or institutions”. College’s
action to restrict Felix’s distribution
channels certainly falls within this
remit, in my opinion.
Even among our own ranks,
there was a wide range of reactions
to Comms’ decision. There was
universal sympathy for the position
that College were put in: a campus
decorated with the phrase “extreme
child pornography” at the same
time as it was being flooded with
young visitors (and their parents).
However, there was a lot of anger and
frustration at the way they responded.
Many of us felt that was overkill to
remove Felix distribution bins from
areas of campus that were not hosting
Festival talks, booths and events.
The clearly designated festival
entrance was on Imperial College
Road, and the vast majority of
visitors would likely not stray
further than the Queen’s Lawn, Sir
Alexander Fleming Building or the
Sherfield Building. Despite this, our
distribution bins were also removed
from the Business School entrance
and City and Guilds Building, areas
not directly involved in the festival
but visited mostly by our regular Felix
audience.
I am by no means accusing College
of attempting to silence this story
altogether. There was no attempt to
restrict access to the online version
of the article, and some students were
still able to get hold of physical copies
of Felix from the bins we put in the
library and in Beit Quad. However,
withdrawing distribution from our
most high-traffic areas so early on a
Friday afternoon directly resulted
in readers not being able to access
the paper that a team of around 50
students put hundreds of collective
man-hours into producing.
College’s intention may not have
been to restrict Felix’s content
from its normal audience, but they
inadvertently did, and their action
also kept Felix out of the path of
prospective students and alumni.
Felix contributors attending ImpFest
have relayed stories of alumni
asking festival volunteers what had
happened to Felix and why it was
missing from campus. If Comms
had voiced concerns about the story
sooner, we might have been able to
work with organisers to make copies
available on request.
I picked up my first issue of Felix
while attending an Imperial open
day as a prospective student, and it
was this that inspired me to seek out
the team during Freshers’ Fair last
October and get involved. While Felix
is a newspaper made by students, I
don’t think it is necessarily only for
students. We count many members of
the College and Union staff amongst
our readership, and our online
presence enables us to reach alumni
and non-Imperialites too. It saddens
me to see our distribution restricted
from any audience.
Felix is in a unique position among
student publications in the UK in
that we have independent editorial
control over all our content. We are
very fortunate — and proud — not to
have to send our paper to anyone at
the College or the Union for review
before going to print each week.
However, of our own volition we
frequently work with Comms and
the Union where appropriate to lend
insight and balance to our articles.
The phrase “Keep The Cat Free”,
first adopted as Felix’s motto in 1974,
has always represented both the cost
of the paper and its tradition of free
speech. There have been attempts
to infringe on this freedom in the
past — some of them successful — and
it is vital that we publicly recognise
and consider the consequences of
such actions. We must not allow a
precedent to be set for College to
squirrel student media away from
the public view whenever they take a
disliking to our content.
In a world where our own
government is seeking to introduce
wide-ranging powers to ban citizens
from broadcasting and require
them to submit communications
for ‘approval’ before circulation,
it is more important than ever for
us to be aware of matters of free
speech. Moving a few distribution
bins out of public view is not a great
transgression, but it is toeing the line
of censorship and — to my mind —
that is a very dangerous thing indeed.
