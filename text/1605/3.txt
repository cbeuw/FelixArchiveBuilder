Society’s first public debate of
the year saw students debate
Lord Professor Robert Winston
and Bioengineering Senior Lecturer
Dr Jennifer Siggers on the motion
“This house believes that religion is
harmful to the progress of science” in
front of a packed lecture theatre.
Speaking first in proposition of
the motion was James Clough, a
PhD candidate in the Department
of Physics and a World Universities
Debating Championship quarter-
finalist, who made the case that
certain widely held religious
views such as the Biblical account
of creation necessarily caused
people to reject science as a way of
understanding the world.
In opposition, Dr. Siggers argued
that religious belief, in particularly
monotheism, leads to the idea that
the universe is governed by natural
laws, and that religion spurs on
scientific understanding of these
natural laws as a means of better
understanding God.
Final year Physics undergraduate
and Debating Society President Niall
Jeffrey replied that the majority of
scientists have no religious beliefs
and that there are other motivations
underpinning scientific endeavor.
He went on to elaborate historical
examples of religious orthodoxy
holding back scientific progress,
such as the suppression of Galileo’s
proposal of a heliocentric solar
system in Renaissance Italy.
Speaking last, in opposition to the
motion, Lord Winston argued that
humans have an innate religiosity,
drawing on Paleolithic cave paintings
to support this point. He spoke about
his work in the field of embryology,
and how his religious background
made him more able to engage with
critics of this controversial research.
He told the audience that the sense of
wonder that comes from religion has
been a source of great motivation for
him; and that his grandfather, a Chief
Rabbi, was one his inspirations for
pursuing a career as a scientist.
The debate was opened up to
members of the audience, who
raised a variety of points ranging
from the relationship of Eastern
religions to science to the possible
effect preconceptions due to religious
belief having an effect on the lines of
enquiry that scientists may take.
Debating Society President Niall
Jeffrey told Felix, “we are extremely
pleased to see so many people coming
to watch and get involved in the
debate, which has been our most
successful public event to date. We
hope that people will have many
more chances to join our debates in
future, and on behalf of the debating
society and everyone present I would
like to extend my thanks to Lord
Winston and Dr. Siggers for their
participation and for helping make
this such a stimulating and enjoyable
evening.”
Car flipped over on
Exhibition Road, two injured
Two women were treated for
minor injuries after their car
was flipped onto its roof due to
a collison with a lorry on Exhibition
Road. The incident occurred on
Tuesday afternoon outside the
Natural History Museum, which also
saw a Rolls-Royce take damage.
Speaking to the London Evening
Standard, businessman Mohamad
Ridha, the owner of the Rolls-Royce,
described the dramatic moment when
the hatchback was thrown into the air
and almost crashed on top of his car.
“I was behind the two women as the
hatchback waited in traffic”, said the
30-year old.
“A truck came round the corner and
had forgotten to close his back door.
Everyone was waving and beeping to
try and warn him. The metal ledge
that was hanging down, it banged into
the car and got stuck under its front,
dragged it a little way then lifted it up
in the air and threw it on to the floor.”
Ridha estimates that the damage
caused the the hatchback hitting
the front of his car will “cost about
£20,000 or £30,000 in repairs. It all
happened so fast, I was very shocked -
we were thinking the car was going to
come through the window.”
He also told how he and other
bystanders rushed to the aid of the
two women in the car after the car
flipped. “They were banging on the
doors and windows asking for help.
We got them out. They were shocked
and didn’t believe what happened.
I’ve never seen something like this in
my life.”
Emergency services were called
to the scene shortly after 2pm, with
footage captured showing the London
Fire Brigade righting the overturned
car with manpower. A spokesman for
the Metropolitan Police said officers
were called at 14.22pm to reports
of a car flipped on to its roof, with
paramedics treating two women for
minor injuries.

Amazon soon to
deliver to Sherfield
Anew Amazon collection point
has been installed on campus,
allowing staff and students
to receive their parcels from South
Kensington instead of waiting in at
home.
The locker system, based on the
Sherfield Walkway, has 84 units of
varying sizes that can hold parcels for
three days before they are sent back
to the original sender. When students
place an order online, they will be
given a code to access the goods.
Although the lockers are not ready
to use quite yet, they will soon be
set up and will also be accessible by
members of the public.
The preparation costs to install
the lockers were covered by College
Estates, but Amazon has covered the
gross cost of the lockers as a whole.
Imperial has seen an increasing
number of parcels being delivered
to campus. In December, over 2,000
packages were sent to campus, whilst
another 1,800 were sent in January.
Felix spoke to Estates, who are
responsible for the lockers. A
spokesperson told us: “The lockers
will hopefully take the pressure of
the post room, and deliver a great
service that both staff and students
can enjoy.”
Estates will publicise when the
lockers are available for use later on
in the term.
