There’s not much change at the
top in Cameron’s cabinet reshuffle,
but in the‘bottom’half there are
far more young and fresh faces,
including more women.
It seems there have been
rewards for loyalty in the reshuffle,
and many of the promotions have
been given to people close to
George Osbourne,which is good
news for his leadership bid when
Cameron steps down before the
next election.
Below is some of the key members
of the first all conservative Cabinet
for almost 20 years:
also be out of Parliament.
Leadership elections will soon
take place for both parties with
the former Care minister Norman
Lamb and former President of the
Lib Dems Tim Farron looking like
the two most likely candidates for
the Liberal Democrats. Options are
understandably rather more limited
after the party lost a staggering 49 of
their 57 MPs.
Labour’s leadership election
is comparably more open, with
candidates including the interim
leader Harriet Harman, Shadow
Health secretary Andy Burnham and
Shadow Business Secretary Chuka
Umunna.
Boris Johnson, the current Mayor
of London, is also back in parliament
as MP of Uxbridge, and despite his
infamous notoriety, has promised
to be a “truly local MP.” He is widely
tipped to take over from David
Cameron over the course of the next
parliament, possibly taking over as
prime minister as soon as 2017 (after
the promised EU referendum).
