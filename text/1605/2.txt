This week we are covering the
aftermath of the elections,
and what has unfolded in
the seven days since we woke up
to a Conservative majority. A lot
has happened as a result of this
unprecedented result, including
thousands taking to the streets
to show their disdain for the new
government.
Closer to home, we elected
Conservative MPs in all the local
constituencies except Hammersmith,
which saw Andy Slaughter retain
his Labour seat for another five
years. We’ve interviewed him this
week, to see what his plans are for
the local area, how he feels about the
Conservatives ruling the roost, and
his thoughts on free education.
In our esteemed Comment section,
we pick apart the attitude to those
who voted Conservative, who seem
to have retreated from social media
at a speed proportional to their seat
gains last Friday morning. It is being
said that “it was the shy tories wot
won it”, but perhaps they are acting
more cautious than coy regarding
their voting choices. Vitriol is being
flung left, right and centre on social
media, showing that despite the party
gaining a political majority, they may
not have obtained the approval of
many of those with a twitter account.
In better news, this week has
been great for celebrating the best
of Imperial; we have covered the
Student Academic Choice Awards,
which showcased our incredible
teaching, support, supervision, and
tutoring. We have also covered
Imperial Festival, which proved to
be a delightful day of sharing our
experience of science with the wider
public.
However, the big discussion in the
office this week was the removal of
Felix issues in publicly accessible
spaces, something that has left
the editorial team Felix divided.
Our last front page was considered
“inappropriate” for the large amounts
of children visiting the festival, and
College removed it from campus for
the duration of the weekend. With
visiting alumni noticing the absence
of the paper from around campus, it
was disappointing that we couldn’t
have had such a positive issue to give
out and show off ourselves the great
things Imperial are up to.
With news being time sensitive, the
story being within the public interest
(in our opinion) and the nature of
front page being the place to print
our most prominent story, it seemed
simply an unfortunate coincidence.
Check out our news editor’s comment
piece on the matter and hear her
point of view, and see if you have
another view on what happened.
Regardless of last weekend, we will
always strive to fill these pages as if
the cat will be always free, although
will do so with the lessons learnt in
the back of our minds.
Unlike other student newspapers,
we are not subject to editorial control
by the Union or College. We do not
need to send proofs to either before
going to print (evident by the amount
of typos that sneak through), and
despite last weekend we have never
been censored completely and hope
we have always managed to get the
news that matters to you, straight to
you as soon as possible.
With that in mind, there is still
time for you to get involved. There
may only be five issues to go, but that
is plenty of time to put pen to paper
and get your message out there too. It
may be late in the year, but it is never
to late to send us your thoughts and
share them (as far as possible) across
campus.
