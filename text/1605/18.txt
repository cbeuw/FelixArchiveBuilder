Boyhood? Not for these girls

This week in Film: Terminator Genisys
The latest film in director Celine
Sciamma’s ‘Trilogy of Youth’
is Girlhood (Bande des Filles),
a coming-of-age story set on the
housing projects bordering Paris.
The title of this French-language
film directly translates as Girl Gang
– but the English film title knowingly
references Richard Linklater’s
critically lauded 2014 film, Boyhood,
which similarly focused on issues on
adolescence and identity.
In Girlhood, Karidja Touré plays
sixteen year old Marieme, a quiet
schoolgirl who cares for her two
younger sisters.
Life isn’t easy; having been refused
the opportunity to attend high school
on spurious grounds, Marieme must
quickly decide what to make of her
life when the only other options
appear to be becoming a cleaner,
a drug dealer, a young mum or a
prostitute.
Her own mother is largely absent,
working long hours at a cleaning job
which must provide for four children;
and for a father figure she has only a
bullying, older brother.
Marieme’s life seems to be void of
friendship or relief, revolving solely
around family duties.
It is at this point that she is adopted
by a group of three fearless, rowdy
girls Fily (Mariétou Touré), Adiatou
(Lindsay Karamoh) and their
enigmatic leader, Lady (Assa Sylla).
Unusually for French cinema,
the cast are predominantly black
actors. In interviews, Sciamma has
mentioned the paucity of black
students at French drama schools,
which resulted in her using street-
casting to bring her characters to life.
All of the performances are
magnetic; the four lead actresses
had no previous experience yet their
charisma and on-screen presence
carries the film.
Karidja Touré is captivating as
Marieme, whose outwardly shy
demeanour masks a quick witted
and resourceful survivor. You only
ever want Marieme to be alright, but
like so many other young people, her
dazzlingly depressing set of prospects
leaves her clearly vulnerable.
The boys on the estate also travel
in packs. They sit on low walls and
stairways like sentries, watching
everything, ready to shame the girls’
appearance and behavior.
When they are in their own bubble,
shielded from the male gaze, it
seems that the girls can do anything.
They are funny, loud and charming,
when they want to be. They’re
also fearsome, bitchy and violent:
Definitely not the sort of people you
want to be pissing off.
Dance is used repeatedly to show
them at their most ebullient and
carefree. There are some beautifully
shot dance scenes, particularly the
one to Rihanna’s ‘Diamonds’.
The tight shots focus on the actors’
faces, lingering on their skin, which
appears in rich shades of blue and
black. The actors are really good
dancers so at times it’s frustrating
that the shot-framing doesn’t reveal
The marketing campaign for
the latest reboot/revival of the
Terminator series continues
rolling, with a new batch of character
posters hitting the web this week.
Posters for Terminator Genisys* have
arrived, featuring looks at Arnold
Schwarzenegger returning to one of
the roles that made him famous, as
well as Emilia Clarke’s take on Sarah
Connor (originally played by Linda
Hamilton).
There are also posters for John
Connor (now played by Jason Clarke)
and Kyle Reese (Jai Courtenay),
leaders of the human resistance
in 2029 as well, with one proving
potentially more spoiler-ific than the
other.
The spoiler-ridden posters are
typical of the whole campaign for
Genisys, truth be told, with the two
trailers for the film (so far) already
managing to reveal the majority of
the film’s plot.
Several potentially big plot
surprises are already common
knowledge (but won’t be spoiled here).
The film initially follows the
plot of the original Terminator film
(as written and directed by James
Cameron), with John Connor sending
Reese back in time to 1984 to prevent
Skynet’s eponymous Terminator
from murdering Sarah Connor.
From there, it all goes off the rails,
as Reese finds himself in an alternate
timeline where Connor was orphaned
by a Terminator, and has been raised
by a very familiar cyborg in her
parents’ place.
Directed by Alan Taylor (of Game
of Thrones and Thor: The Dark World),
and also starring the likes of Matt
Smith (Doctor Who, obviously),
Terminator Genisys is due to ruin
spelling across the UK from July 3.
*Yes, that is the real title. No, that’s
not a misprint.

GIRLHOOD
Director: Celine Sciamma
Screenplay: Celine Sciamma
Cast: Karidja Toure, Assa Sylla,
Lindsay Karamoh, Marietou Toure
more of this.
However, these scenes have a
purpose: to show the character’s
personalities, their group dynamic
and to move the action along.
It’s more important and impressive
that Sciamma avoids the music
video clichés of black girls as
hypersexualized twerk-a-holics,
instead she celebrates their beauty
and personality.
It is rare to see such an honest and
joyful depiction of female friendship.
Girlhood passes the Bechdel test
with flying colours, presenting well-
written, complex characters who are
rebellious, outspoken, determined
and tender. More like women that
you or I might know.
This is definitely one to watch with
friends. It serves as a bittersweet
reminder that there is more than one
kind of true love.
