This week, you are Hangman
again. You’ve managed to get
your job back by insisting
you don’t even know what
a “standard” is, let alone
how to have them, but your
horoscopes writer submits
another dodgy one and you
censor it.
The Editor has you shot to
prevent further problems.

This week your friend asks you
how sexually frustrated you
are as a consequence of your
most recent horoscopes. You
then proceed to look far into
the distance whilst “The Sound
of Silence” by Simon and
Garfunkel plays in your head
for a couple of minutes.
This week, joyed by the
election of the Tories and the
subsequent legalization of fox
hunting you decide to lead a
brigade of your chums across
Hyde Park; however you are
out a little too late and you
have to boost your horse over
the fence because the peasants
locked the gates.
This week you are the
horoscopes writer. Embittered
by Hangman’s censorship of
one of your horoscopes last
week, you try and sneak a jab at
editorial censorship into this
week’s horoscopes. You think
Hangman won’t notice.
You are wrong.
This week you are reminded
just how infertile you are by
Lord Professor Sir Dr Robert
Winston, causing you to have
a midlife crisis at 23. Perhaps
you should freeze some eggs,
find a life partner, or even
buy a cat? You instead decide
to carry on doing Buzzfeed
quizzes to find out which West
Wing character you are.
This week you are still
embittered by the fact that
you bought 50 Dip Dabs,
angry that the money didn’t
go somewhere more useful.
you actually hate the taste of
them now – like the idea of
consuming another one makes
you physically sick. Honestly,
if you want one just ask. I don’t.
Fuck Dip Dabs.
This week you decide to go
for a cheeky Nandos after
perusing through your local JD
sports, planning to get fucking
mashed at the local ‘Spoons
afterwards; however you, being
a fucking ledge, go for the extra
hot option. This unfortunately
causes your tongue to peel off.
Peak times.
This week in a shock decision,
Chris Kaye is elected as
leader of UKIP, meaning
he unfortunately has to
resign as Deputy President
(Finance). His first act is
deporting all non-fresh pizza
bases back to Iceland due to a
misunderstanding and he is
forced to return to Imperial.
This week due to the increased
stress from your exams you
decide to go to a petting zoo to
alleviate some stress; however
you accidentally pet a puppy
a bit too hard and kill it. You
sneak it out in your jacket
potato container from the
library and try to forget about
everything.
This week due to the toilets
in your halls being clogged
up, you are forced to defecate
in a bucket whilst trying to
maximise your revision time.
After it has festered for a few
weeks you then give it to the
Tate Modern where it wins
several Pulitzer prizes.
This week you are the CGCU
President. You decide to climb
the statue of Prince Albert
outside the RAH while off
your face, but mid-climb you
slip, fall, and break most of
your important bones.
You demand a horoscope as
reward for your stupidity. Well
done. We’re judging you.
This week you are still in shock
and gutted over the most
recent election result as you are
such a lefty, you’d probably
bang Tony Blair. As a result,
you launch a revolution against
South Kensington by painting
yourself red; unfortunately
there was lead in the paint and
you are hospitalized. No NHS
for lefties though.
Diary Of a Fresher, aged 19 0/4
Sunday 8th May
I’ve given up on revision, it just all seems a bit pointless. I’ve just started surfing the internet. stuff on there, it
turns out. I’d never really thought about looking at those kind of websites before, but once you actually get going
it gets really addictive. I found one site where you can pay to get the really good stuff, I’m still wiaiting for my
student loan to come in, so I don’t have enough money for it at the moment,
Monday 9th May
My student loan for this term came in! Finally. Now I actually think I might jsusthave enough money to pay for
access to the rest of the website, especially the pages where and also if you pay a little more you can get into
the really good bits, which have a ton of really dodgy shit, and it’s so good. I can’t get enough of it right now.
Am I addicted?
Tuesday 10th May
I’m definitely addicted. This is probably really bad. I saw a news story in Felix about someone who got caught looking
at some really dodgy pictures on the internet, and it sounds like some of the pictures that I had to pay for may
have been dodgier than I expected.
Wednesday 11th May
Okay, now I’m really concerned that the Police are going to come through my door. I really hope I’m just paranoid.
Thursday 12th May
OH NO IT’S THE POLICE OH GOD OH GOD WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME I HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING
