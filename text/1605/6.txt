The MPs that are now
representing you
Jo Johnson,newly elected MP
for Orpington in the London
Borough of Bromley,has
succeeded Greg Clark (a former
economist) as Minister of State
for Universities and Science.
Questions have been raised
about his credibility for the role
considering he has no formal
science education,whilst others
are concerned over his reduced
influence within the cabinet.
However,his pro-EU stance
and favour for international
students may prove beneficial,
and for Imperial students in
particular.
Currently the role of Science
Minister is not a cabinet minster
position,although those
previously in the roles have
attended cabinet meetings in
the past.However,Cameron has
not chosen Johnson to sit in such
meetings this time around.
This decision is raising
concerns over the lack of voice
for science during decision-
making by the government’s
most senior decision-making
body.
Naomi Weir,acting director
of the London-based Campaign
for Science and Engineering,has
said:“It will be really important
to make sure that science has
a voice at central government
level,and previously that has
been maintained by the science
minister attending cabinet.”
His lack of scientific credibility
has also come under fire,with
his father,no less,stating
during a radio interview:“Good
Heavens.I don’t think he knows
anything about science!”
Despite this,Johnson has
been praised for his previous
statements of support of EU
membership and international
student provision.
Johnson has stated that he
plans to keep International
students out of the steep curbs
on immigration levels that
Cameron has proposed.
Johnson is the younger
brother of the London mayor,
Boris Johnson,with a similar
educational background.
After two years as an
investment banker at Deutsche
bank,he then joined the
financial times.As of the 2010
election he has been the MP for
Orpington.

Universities
and Science
Areas around South Kensington
saw the expected election of
several Conservative MPs,
although popular student haunt
Hammersmith did see the re-election
of their current Labour MP, Andy
Slaughter.
Chelsea and Fulham saw the
re-election of conservative Greg
Hands, who held a majority with
25,322 votes. He powered past Labour
Candidate Alexandra Sanderson who
only commanded 9,300 votes exactly.
Hands also acted as the Conservative
party Deputy Chief Whip during the
campaign.
During campaigning, Hands had
stressed the importance of increasing
the number of “excellent” state
schools in the area, and was keen to
point out that under his previous five
year tenure unemployment in the
area has fallen by half.
When asked about the demolition
of Charing Cross hospital before his
election, Hands had said that the
Conservatives do plan to demolish
the concrete tower block, but only
after the introduction of a brand
new hospital, with an Accident and
Emergency.
“The rebuilding will leave it capable
of providing even better services in
the future, becoming a leading centre
of excellence for elective surgery.”
Hands has also led a long-running
campaign for more frequent and
upgraded trains on the District
Line, focussing particularly on the
Wimbledon branch.
After he was announced as winner
in the early hours of Friday morning,
Hands said: “We have won well across
the country. People have shown
confidence in David Cameron and
the Conservatives and our long-term
economic plans.”
The Kensington conservative safe
seat saw the election of the former
deputy mayor of London, Lady
Victoria Borwick.
Borwick won the seat with 18,199
votes, surpassing Labour candidate
Rob Adouharb’s 10,838 votes. Lib
Dem candidate, Robin McGhee
received only 1,962 votes in total,
although still managed to beat Green
and UKIP candidates.
Borick said to local paper
getwestlondon: Lady Borwick said:
“I’m honoured to be elected.
“Kensington is not just home to the
rich and famous. I live here and grew
up here. I know there is a lot of people
here who need help. I will make sure
they get everything they need.
“The key areas are the best health
provision, excellent schools and
housing.
“I’m a seven-day-a-week councillor.
I do not disappear off to Scotland
every weekend. I’m going to make
sure I am here for the people as much
as possible.”
Borwick opposes the mansion tax,
and whilst campaigning she vowed to
fight the proposed taxes on high value
homes.
She does support the renegotiation
of the conditions of the UK’s EU
membership, and states on her
website that: “Maintain the sense of
family and community that makes
Kensington such a special place to
live.”
The Hammersmith constituency
saw the re-election of Andy Slaughter,
a Labour MP who has represented the
area since 2010. Slaughter won with
23,981 votes, beating Conservative
candidate Charlie Dewhirst, who
received 17,463 votes, with the Lib
Dems coming in third ahead of
Greens and UKIP.
Slaughter’s previous campaigns
have included petitioning against
hospital closures in the area, opposing
the proposed third Heathrow runway,
and addressing the “Hammersmith
Housing Crisis.”
Imperial’s South Kensington
campus is actually split between
two constituencies, with half of
the buildings residing in the Cities
of London and Westminster
constituency and the other half
falling under Kensington.
All buildings north of Imperial
College Road, which runs in front
of SAF and the chemistry buildings
are in the Cities of London and
Westminster constituency. These
include halls of residence in Princes
Gardens and Beit quad.
The Cities of London and
Westminster constituency saw the
re-election of Conservative Mark
Field, who commanded 54.1% share
of the vote.
Field received 19,570 votes, beating
Labour Candidate Nik Slingsby who
received 9,899 votes and Lib Dem
Belinda Brooks-Green, who received
2,521 votes. Field has been MP for
the constituency since 2001, and the
Cities of London and Westminster is
very much so a conservative safe seat.
Field has previously been involved
with securing the future development
of Bart’s hospital and also St Mary’s,
part of Imperial College. He was a
vocally opposed the “tent city” of
anti-capitalist protesters that camped
outside of St Paul’s in 2011.
In 2014 he launched “Conservatives
for Managed Migration,” a working
group designed “to promote a calm,
reasoned debate about immigration.”
Although turnout in this General
Election stood at 66.1%, the highest
turnout seen since 1997, turnout
in parts of west London was
considerably lower. 43.2% of those
registered to vote in Kensington
failed to make it to the polling
stations, whilst 33.4% of those in
registered in Hammersmith didn’t
cast their vote either.
Nationally, if those who did not
vote formed a party, the “Did Not
Vote” party, they would have won 343
seats overall.
