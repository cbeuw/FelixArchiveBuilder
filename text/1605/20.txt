Documentary TV: The Theroux Effect

Jonathan Masters finds himself questioning the aims of TV docs
"Is this
anything
more than
voyerism,
or does
it have a
positive
effect?"
Those of you that have a TV
Licence, or have had a look at
BBC IPlayer recently (much
more likely), will have seen that
Louis Theroux – the mild mannered,
inherently awkward, bespectacled
documentarian – has a new series,
of which three episodes have already
been broadcast early, due to the
Clarkson-shaped hole in BBC Two’s
Sunday scheduling. My question is, is
it anything more than voyeurism or
does he have a genuine positive effect?
Theroux has been making
documentaries since 1998, starting
off with the often comical Weird
Weekends series, which varied from
him spending time with Black
extremists in America, to trying to
embark on an admittedly short lived
gangsta rap career. The humour of
this series was then slightly lost in his
next endeavours, which consisted of
numerous interviews with various
personalities, including the infamous
episode where he interviewed Jimmy
Saville, an incredibly uncomfortable
piece of television to watch now
with the knowledge of Saville’s
history of abuse. The next series was
to become Theroux’s template for
many to come: a much more mature
and confident portrayal of issues
such as the crystal meth culture of
Fresno, or institutions specifically for
rehabilitating paedophiles.
His current series has focussed
on firstly a two-part piece on a
psychiatric hospital for criminals that
have committed crimes by reason of
insanity, an extremely interesting
watch that portrays seemingly
placid inmates who have committed
horrifically violent crimes. There
is an uncomfortably intriguing
sequence where it is uncertain if
one inmate is falsifying his mental
condition in order to bypass serving a
longer jail sentence, highlighting the
uncertainty of mental health within
the judicial system. The third episode
focussed on transgender children, the
youngest interviewee being a 5 year
old who, although born Sebastian,
now identified themselves as Camille.
Also an extremely interesting
watch, especially highlighting the
dilemmas that the parents of these
children face in whether or not to
dismiss it as a phase, or encourage
it to the point of seeking hormone
therapy for the child. Quite
interesting also for the fact that it
evoked a moral ambiguity in myself,
making me consider if I would allow
my (hypothetical) child to make the
same decisions at this age that the
other parents had allowed
At its best, documentarian film-
making can induce this sort of moral
introspection, but one has to wonder
where you draw the line between
portrayal and voyeurism – whilst
watching the first two episodes based
in the psychiatric hospital, I found
myself drawn to not so much the life
of the inmates in the facility, but to
what crimes they had perpetrated,
and I think that the documentaries
themselves are structured in a
way that it leads the audience into
wanting to know what heinous crime
they committed, and almost enjoying
the knowledge of it.
Louis Theroux as a documentarian
is unparalleled in his curiosity,
frequently asking extremely personal
questions, even questioning his
interviewees’ fundamental beliefs,
such as in an episode where he visits
the controversial hate-inciting
Westboro Baptist Church, leading to
his trademark long awkward pauses,
and cringe inducing stares. In an
interview with Sophie Heawood
of The Guardian he stated that his
greatest fear was that he “is not
helping” the situations that he
portrays in order to draw attention
to them and provide greater public
knowledge; however, this begs the
question: Is greater public awareness
helpful, or just a passive act?
This is a question that I believe
must be asked by not only
documentarians but journalists as a
whole. It’s all very well writing about
the stagnant state of British politics,
but perhaps only writing about it
is just shifting the responsibility to
someone who is willing to actually
make that change.
If that is the case, then what is the
point? Surely it would be far more
effective to try and be the change
that you want to see in the world
(I apologize for the shoe-horned
quote). This issue also came up in the
Question Time appearance of Russell
Brand and Nigel Farage, where an
audience member asked Brand why
"What does
promoting
awareness
do if not
simply pass
the torch
along the
line?"
he has never tried to stand if he
thinks that the current selection
of candidates are homogenous.
Now although I am in no way an
advocate for Farage nor Brand, I
do think it’s an interesting point:
what does promoting awareness do
if not pass the torch along the line?
Perhaps eventually someone will do
something, but what about now?
The Guardian interview with
Theroux then ends with Heawood
questioning why he does not
intervene in places, such as young
boy in the Westboro Baptist Church
who had a vitriolic hatred of
homosexuals, taught by his mother.
Theroux replied with “No, I go in
to tell stories, to reveal the truth
and to try to understand. Not to set
people straight,” he says. “I don’t go
into this with the agenda of saving
the world.” It’s possible that this
passive approach, rather than the
authoritarian world-policeman one, is
a more worthy position to take.
