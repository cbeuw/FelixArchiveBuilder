how much, rather than whether, from
now on I think.
JR: Do you not think it’s wrong
that it was Labour that introduced
tuition fees in 1998, Labour that
increased them in 2001, the Tories
that proposed to increase them
again but it was the Lib Dems that
got punished for it?
AS: I think the issue with the Lib
Dems is one of trust, because it was so
blatant, and they did get elected on
signing that pledge.
For good reasons or bad, politicians
don’t keep their promises sometimes.
But I don’t think there is any other
example of anything quite so horrific
as that, where you pledge to abolish
something you then triple the cost of.
JR: But in the 2001 election
Labour’s manifesto stated that
you would legislate against anyone
raising tuition fees, and then Blair
tripled them from one to three
thousand pounds a year in 2004.
AS: Well yes, I mean the Tories
promised they weren’t going to
increase VAT and they did and
so on and so forth but we’re not
so much talking about the issue
here. We’re talking about what the
Liberal Democrats did and what the
consequences were for them and
the apology for that which was an
apology for making the promise in
the first place, and I just think they
got themselves into a terrible mess
over it.
JR: The Labour manifesto put
cutting the deficit as a priority.
Does this mean that the economic
argument has been won and the
Keynesian model of debt-financed
socialism is dying?
AS: No I think the fact is that most
responsible people think we have to
balance the books and it’s a question
of how and over what period and
what criteria we work to in relation
to that. But what the big difference
between Labour and the Tories on
this was the flexibility of how we
pay it off. Are you factoring in the
relationship with economic growth,
so we have the ability to borrow still
to fund investment? That’s where the
argument was I think.
JR: Would you not agree that the
SNP swept the board in Scotland
because of their anti-austerity
position in comparison with
Labour?
AS: Yes but if you actually look at
their proposals they were more
restrictive than Labour’s so I think
it made for a good headline but you
didn’t have to dig very deep to realise
that it just didn’t add up.
JR: As a former councillor, do you
believe that it’s very important for
politicians to have experience in
local government?
AS: I think it’s helpful but I don’t
think it’s essential. I think people are
realising that you want people from
a whole variety of backgrounds to get
involved.
There are certain things that are
the same; representing people, doing
casework, campaigning and so forth,
but lots of other experience is useful
as well.
JR: What are your key concerns
over the next parliament?
AS: I’m concerned that you’ve
got a very right wing Tory party,
which is concealed somewhat by the
presentational skills of Cameron. I’m
concerned about everything, from
restrictions on trade unions to cutting
welfare benefits.
This is going to be a very harsh
agenda that is aimed at the people the
Tories see as its enemies: poor people,
organised labour etc.
And with the crying social
problems that we have, for example
the housing shortage, are not going
to be addressed, and market forces
are going to dominate without any
proper mitigation.
We are also we are quite likely to
see an attack on civil liberties; we’ve
talked about the human rights act,
the snooper’s charter and so forth.
It’s a very right wing agenda and I’m
not sure the public quite realise what
they’ve voted for.
JR: In 2010 you voted for Ed in the
Labour leadership election, who are
you backing this time?
AS: I genuinely, genuinely haven’t
decided. We haven’t even seen the
full field yet and one or two of the
candidates I don’t know that well.
I do know well candidates like
Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham.
It’s difficult to make a complete
assessment and I think you really
want to give people a fair chance to
set up their stall so I will reserve my
judgment on that for now.
