David Cameron proposes to
plug this funding hole by asking
private parties to step up to the
plate. The ‘Big Society’ pledges come
directly after the arts pledges in the
manifesto, suggesting a growing
reliance on private philanthropy
and privatisation to sustain the arts
in the face of falling government
subsidy. This has been the party line
for some time now. Back in 2010,
the then Culture Secretary Jeremy
Hunt said “if you said to me what
is the one thing I could do […] that
would make a real difference to the
arts, I would say it would be to help
foster an American-style culture of
philanthropy to the arts and culture
here in the UK.” Critics of this policy
point out that the tax system in the
UK does not encourage philanthropy
in the same way as the US, where a
culture donating to the arts has been
built up over decades. Placing all of
the funding power in the hands of
private philanthropists instead of
centralising to some degree such as to
Arts Council England poses the risk
of supporting only a narrow range
of artists, stifling creativity that
currently thrives despite being on the
peripheries of mainstream culture.
Silencing this group of new artists
still finding their voice would further
reinforce a chronic lack of diversity
that has already taken root in this
country’s artistic landscape.
More and more, young artists may
find themselves relying on charities
such as Arts Emergency which seeks
to provide opportunities for young
people in the arts via inclusion in
the ‘Alternative Old Boy’s Network’.
Privatisation, on the other hand, has
already led to chaos at the National
Gallery. When management chose
to outsource two thirds of its gallery

staff to a private security firm earlier
this year, the union representing
them, PCS, organised two 5-day
strikes. A third is planned if a new
pay cannot be negotiated.
These strikes have meant closing
off gallery spaces housing some of the
most important art in the country
– including Vincent Van Gough’s
Sunflowers – behind huge black doors;
school trips were cancelled, tourists
were left disappointed. Citing this
example as a possible harbinger
of worse to come, Jonathan Jones,
art critic for The Guardian, wrote
this week that “five more years of
Cameron will reduce the arts to a
national joke”.
Not everyone is so pessimistic.
Newly appointed chief executive
of Arts Council England Darren
Henley claimed that Conservatives
understand the value of the arts,
telling The Stage that the Tories had
been more supportive of the arts in
the previous parliament than they
were of many other sectors. Certainly,
Labour’s plan for the arts didn’t seem
to differ much from their opponents’:
when a Tory dossier emerged earlier
this year claiming that Labour would
reverse £83m of spending cuts to the
arts, the Labour press team took to
Twitter to simply say “we won’t”.
Although under fire from all sides,
the country’s cultural capital is
perhaps one of the strongest exports
we have. The creative industries
generate £76.9bn annually – that
equates to £8.8m per hour and
accounts for over 5% of UK jobs. Last
year, as productivity fell, the creative
sector actually grew by 1%. Speaking
to The Guardian John Kampfner, CEO
of Creative Industries Federation,
says “[success in the arts] has not
come by accident or in isolation, but
is the result of several decades of
smart investment and policy-making.
To make any further cuts in arts
and arts education budgets at a time
when we have irrefutable evidence
of their economic value (let alone
their social value) would be to bite
the hand that feeds us.” Jane Webb,
director of studies at Manchester
Metropolitan University adds “art
and design is about changing the
world, not just producing more
images, objects, or working within
jobs that already exist.” The July
2013 report Humanities Graduates
and the British Economy: The Hidden
Impact conducted by the University
of Oxford has found that 80% of all
Oxford humanities graduates go on to
be employed by key economic growth
sectors such as finance, law, media,
and education. This is a trend that has
been replicated across universities.
The arts are often referred to a ‘soft
subject’, which to politicians can too
often mean code for ‘easy target’, but
the new government must look to
the long term when deciding where
the cuts should fall. Being too short
sighted and caving to the pressure to
cut the arts budget in order to protect
others may do more harm than
good all round according to David
Pountney, the chief executive and
artistic director of Welsh National
Opera, who wrote last month “well-
being is not something that can
be segmented into physical health
alone. A lively mind stimulated and
nurtured by cultural experience is
one very important kind of health
– a kind of health that can inspire
and energise a new generation.” He
added that unless the government
could recognise this fact, the “new
generation [could become] the lost

generation”.
In a typically eloquent address
in the Arts Council England (ACE)
Annual Report for 2013-14 published
last month, Sir Peter Bazalgette,
the Chair of ACE, wrote “we do hear
the question asked, “Can we afford
to fund the arts?” The answer is
simple: “We can’t afford not to”.
And the tougher things get the
more important our cultural life
becomes.” He goes on to cite a 1945
radio address made by John Maynard
Keynes, who established public
funding of the arts in Britain: “[arts
funding is] to replace what the war
had taken away”. The case for survival
of the arts is has never made more
clearly than by Donbass Opera in
Donetsk, Ukraine, which remained
open to give performances even as
tanks rolled down the streets. Deputy
Director Natalia de Kovalyova said
“tickets were free and there were
hundreds of people queuing, we
crammed in as many as we could. Two
old ladies were in tears, on their knees
and kissing his hands in gratitude
that he had opened the season”.
Nothing so dramatic is likely
to happen here, but there is still
something to be said for escaping
into art when life seems hard. We
should be encouraging people to come
together and enjoy and participate
in the arts, not starving it of oxygen.
Ultimately, the new government has
a choice to make; they could view the
arts in a purely economic sense in
the short term and cut further into
the arts budget, or see the arts as an
opportunity to invest in the creativity
and the talent of its citizens and reap
the rewards in the long run. I know
which one I would choose.
