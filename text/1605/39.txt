Rain, showers and fruit theft
Wednesday saw continued
progression by everyone, particularly
from the students, with Hassan and
Iulian successfully reaching fully-
solo standard, with the minimum
requirement of 7 jumps.
Three members departed the group
on the fourth day to return home.
Back at the dropzone, a passing front
meant unfavourable weather for
beginners after the morning, which
slowed progress for the students. The
remaining experienced skydivers
managed to get a few jumps in
between showers. Later on in the
day, both Lucys completed level
7 and went solo standard! Hassan
wandered into Alvor town and found
a fruit he hadn’t seen since he was in
Jordan around this time last year, and
brought some back to the dropzone
to show us. He told us he had
“borrowed” them from a Portuguese
farmer. Pippa hit 100 jumps, and
Isaac liked Lisbon so much he missed
his flight. Oops.
Solo Jumping
By Friday, all of the novices were
onto jumping solo, which meant no
more waiting around for available
instructors. This put them at a
stage that allowed them to jump in
any dropzone around the world!
Nicole decided that landing on the
designated landing area was too
mainstream (high winds forced her
to drift off) and so landed (safely!) a
couple of miles away, on the other
side of the river next to the dropzone.
Friday was the main social night
of tour – we went to the skydivers’
local haunt, which that night was
overwhelmed by hordes of skydivers,
and had a great time.
Once we’d all pulled ourselves out
of crippling hangovers the next day,
we go straight back to jumping (with
a few members taking it a bit slower
than others). José and Pippa were
on the first jump of the day at 09:00
sharp and smashed through 8 jumps
each. Iulian and Hassan completed
their 10 consolidation jumps and
achieved A-licence status, making
them officially qualified skydivers!
Members got a couple more jumps
in on the last day before having to
leave in the afternoon for Lisbon. We
slept over at the airport as we had a
stupidly early flight in to London.
Hassan took the opportunity for one
last wander around when everyone
else was asleep.
IC Skydiving were the only university
society at the skydive event
(otherwise known as a boogie) in the
Algarve, and our attendance there
secured international recognition
in the skydive community, as well
as creating a fantastic bond with the
dropzone to ensure a continuous
partnership for the future. We also
earned a reputation for giving cured
ham to the masses, thanks to Pippa
buying a whole leg of ham and
bringing it to the dropzone, feeding
everyone around her. You have to
look no further than the constant
Facebook updates the dropzone were
publishing to the wider world on
our students and their progression,
to see how much they liked us! We
will be returning there every year
with guaranteed discounts for our
members!
