Joshua Renken covers the key events of
#GE2015, and brings you up to speed
with what you may have missed
A generalised guide to the
General Election
In the midst of exams, projects,
deadlines and dissertations, you
can be forgiven for allowing the
General Election to pass you by in
a delirium of red, yellow, blue and
purple. For those of you that didn’t
brave last Thursday night, we’ve
clarified the developments so far, and
highlighted what you need to know
about your next government.
Firstly, the basics
We woke up to a somewhat surprising
Conservative 12-seat majority last
Friday. Meanwhile, Scotland saw a
landslide victory for the SNP, Wales
remained majority Labour and
Northern Ireland’s DUP defended
their share of the seats. The Liberal
Democrats suffered a catastrophic
election result across the United
Kingdom, and UKIP only won one
seat despite winning nearly four
million votes.
The Conservatives increased their
share of the vote by 0.8%, while
Labour won 1.5% more votes and
the SNP surge resulted in 3.1%
more votes amongst all of them in
the UK. The Lib Dems lost 15.2%
of their votes. It is incredibly rare
for governments to increase their
parliamentary representation after
re-election.. No one was expecting this
kind of result.
The voting turnout of the registered
electorate was 66.1%, a modest
improvement on 2010’s 65.1% across
the UK
This election was a big one. The
stakes were incredibly high; with
the size of the state, the union
of the United Kingdom and our
position in the European Union
on the ballot, and with the added
nuanced policy debates around the
NHS, immigration, housing, our
nuclear defences, the continuation of
austerity and political reform, there
was certainly something for everyone
to sink their teeth into.
But for all the impact that the
results will have, you would be
forgiven for thinking this was a
pretty standard issue election. All the
parties ran remarkably risk averse,
sterilised and sometimes downright
dull election campaigns, with no real
stand-out moments.
Playing it safe
To top it all off, after all the sound
and fury, the polls didn’t seem to
budge after more than a month of
campaigning, much to the annoyance
of journalists looking for a headline.
The Conservatives were edging it
in the polls for the last few weeks of
the campaign, during which time
the various party leaders universally
opted for a very stage-managed
appeal to voters through the media,
with virtually no walkabouts among
the general public and a great deal of
backroom spin.
“It was the shy Tories that
won it”
Immediately after the polls closed at
22:00, the exit poll indicated a huge
surge for the Conservatives. The
prediction stood at: Conservatives -
316, Labour - 239, SNP - 58, Liberal
Democrats - 10, Plaid Cymru - 4,
Greens - 2, UKIP - 2, Other - 19.
If this was the case, all the polls
leading up to the election were
seriously off. However we soon
found out that even this poll didn’t
highlight just how comfortably
the Conservatives were to take the
majority.
Soon after the results for each of the
650 seats started trickling in, it didn’t
take the nation long to realise Labour
was about to suffer crushing blow
after crushing blow. Labour’s election
campaign chief, and shadow Foreign
Secretary, Douglas Alexander lost to
a 20-year-old SNP candidate, shortly
followed by the fall of Scottish Labour
leader Jim Murphy.
To add huge insult to injury, the
Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who
would have become the second
most powerful man in a Labour
government, lost his Morley and
Outwood seat. His wife, Yvette
Cooper, won her nearby constituency.
Nick Clegg retained his seat in
Sheffield Hallam, but in a shock
result, Vince Cable, who was the
Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills from 2010 to
2015, lost his Twickenham seat to
the Conservatives. Former Liberal
Democratic leader Charles Kennedy
was defeated by the SNP up in
Scotland, while Danny Alexander,
who had been Chief Secretary to the
Treasury since 2010, was also defeated
for re-election at the hands of the
Scottish Nationalists.
The Liberal Democrat minister
David Laws lost his seat to the
Conservatives, leaving just eight
Liberal Democrats in parliament.
Ed Davey, also a minister in the
last cabinet as Secretary of State for
Energy and Climate Change, didn’t
manage to retain his Kingston and
Surbiton seat.
Esther McVey, who served as
Minister of State for Employment
since 2013, stands out as one of
the very few surprise losers in the
Conservative party. She lost to Labour
by just 400 votes in Wirral West.
George Galloway of the Respect
Party lost to Labour in Bradford
West, ending a parliamentary career
spanning four decades.
Big Names in Parliament
drop like flies
Later on in the day, we saw Nigel
Farage fall short of a win in South
Thanet by some 3,000 votes to the
Conservatives. As promised, he has
resigned as UKIP leader, although
it seems his party ‘has rejected’ his
resignation.
Nigel Farage offered his resignation
to the United Kingdom Independence
Party’s National Executive
Committee (UKIP’s ruling board),
which was rejected on 11th
May.
Many believe this bizarre scenario,
which saw the deputy leader of UKIP,
Suzanne Evans, act as interim leader
for a long weekend, will only bolster
support for Nigel.
He is even being heralded as the
new Messiah – on the third (or fourth)
day he rose again...
The party board judged that, given
the EU referendum that Prime
Minster Cameron has promised to put
to the British electorate before 2017,
it would be damaging to lose their
‘start player’ just as the campaign to
exit the EU begins.
UKIP was founded in 1993 with
the primary objective of securing the
UK’s withdrawal from the EU, but has
fleshed out in recent years as more
than just a pressure group, with a self-
described “democratic, right-wing”
policy platform.
Farage’s continued support by the
party faithful only serves to support
the idea that UKIP is a ‘one man
band’.
Both Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband
Constituencies show how widespread the Cons
"All the
polls
leading
up to the
election
were
seriously
off"
"you would
be forgiven
for
thinking
this was
a pretty
standard
issue
election"
