Swap out those burgers for beans!
New research from a team of scientists, involving some from Imperial College London, suggests that a Western diet, high in protein and fat, can lead to an increased risk of colon cancer

Lauren Ratcliffe reports on lowering your risk of colon cancer
"Gut
bacteria are
thought to
be the key
players in
the effect
diet has
on colon
cancer"
Those late night burgers and
sloppy kebabs may be doing
far more dangerous things to
your body than just expanding your
waistline, research from Imperial
suggests. A diet swap between
American and African volunteers has
indicated that one nation’s dietary
habits leads to a greater risk of getting
colon cancer.
The Western diet, which is typically
high in protein and fat but low in
fibre, is thought to raise colon cancer
risk compared with African diets,
which are usually high in fibre and
low in fat and protein. Gut bacteria
are thought to be the key players in
this effect.
The study, published in Nature
Communications, involved 20 African-
American volunteers and another
group of 20 rural South African
volunteers from KwaZulu-Natal
swapping diets for two weeks. Rural
Africans ate a diet of sausages, hash
browns, burgers, and fries. African-
Americans, on the other hand,
switched to plates of corn fritters,
mango slices, bean stew, and fish
tacos.
The study involved an international
collaboration of researchers,
including some from Imperial
College London and the University
of Pittsburgh, teaming together.
Volunteers within the study all had
colonoscopy examinations, where
they examine the inner lining of
your large intestine. The researchers
also measured biological markers
that indicate colon cancer risk and
examined bacterial samples taken
from the colon.
Before the experiment, almost
half of the American volunteers had
polyps – abnormal growths in the
bowl lining that may be harmless
but could develop into cancerous
growths if left unchecked. Subjects
within the African group had no such
abnormalities. After the study, the
research team discovered that the
African volunteers’ cancer risk had
dramatically increased, whilst the
American volunteers were found to
have far less inflammation in the
colon, as well as reduced biomarkers
of cancer risk.
“The findings suggest that people
can substantially lower their risk of
colon cancer by eating more fibre.
This is not new in itself but what is
really surprising is how quickly and
dramatically the risk markers can
switch in both groups following diet
change.” Professor Jeremy Nicholson,
the team leader from the Department
of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial
College London elucidates.
Colon cancer is the fourth
commonest cause of death from
cancer in the UK, and overall the
second leading cause of cancer death
in the Western World, attributed
to over 600,000 deaths per year
worldwide. However, colon cancer
rates are regionally heterogeneous,
with rates being much higher in the
Western world than in Africa or the
Far East, and greatest in the United
States.
The major reason for these
differences in colon cancer risk
seem to be due to differences in
the types of bacteria in the gut
microbiome. The rural Africans
had more carbohydrate-fermenting

fibre diets

cancer risk"
microbes, and others that produced
the chemical butyrate, which has anti-
cancer properties. The Americans on
the other hand had more microbes
that break down bile acids, which can
increase cancer risk.
This study supports other work
that has shown high-fibre diets
are linked to reduced colon cancer
risk. Although their study can’t
definitively say whether the change
in diet would have led to increased
cancer rates in the African group and
lowered rates in the American group,
there is good evidence from other
studies that indicate the changes
observed were signs of cancer risk.
The findings highlight a serious
concern about the potential
consequences of the current
progressive Westernisation of
African communities, which could
lead to a spike in colon cancer rates
and become a major health issue. On
a more positive side, this study can
also provide vegetarians with some
more ammunition when defending
their principles in front of fiendish
carnivores.
