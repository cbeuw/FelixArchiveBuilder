Jingjie Cheng on the ROH’s new ballet, based of Virginia Woolf’s work
Celebrating the Queen of Modernism
From the very opening moments
of Woolf Works, the audience
realises that what they are
about to experience will not be
anything one would expect from
a conventional ballet, but a bold,
mixed-media theatrical experiment
with dance as its main act.
We are greeted by a recording of
Virginia Woolf’s own voice, musing
on the intricacies of language, as the
stage fills up with a cloud of projected
words, and Alessandra Ferri’s Mrs
Dalloway stands alone on the centre
of the stage. Split into three acts, the
Royal Ballet resident choreographer
Wayne McGregor’s first full-length
ballet corresponds to three separate
stories by Woolf – Mrs Dalloway
(1925), Orlando (1928) and The Waves
(1931).
Called back from retirement at
52 to carry the central character of
the first and third acts, Ferri is a
commanding presence on stage, her
dark hair and eyes and beautifully
expressive body embodying the
melancholy of Clarissa Dalloway, the
eponymous upper-class housewife
from what is arguably Woolf’s most
famous work. It is clear, however,
that the ballet is as much about the
characters as the author herself, as
we feel her presence shift in and out
of Clarissa, weaving her personal
narrative into her heroine. In the
third act when Ferri returns, she is
Woolf herself, both an outsider and
participant to her own story as she
dances around her struggles with
mental illness and eventual suicide.
Ferri delivers a performance that is
both technically superb and intensely
emotional, lending a deep sincerity to
McGregor’s choreography.
The first act follows the narrative
of Mrs Dalloway closely, and it is
possible to identify the heroine
dancing with her husband while
observing her younger self. The stage
is anchored by three large wooden
frames that the characters dance in
and out of, gliding through the past
and present, through fiction and
reality. In a parallel world, mentally
disturbed war veteran Septimus,
played by a captivating Edward
Watson, tries to free himself from
his own shell-shocked mind while
holding on to his wife, who is all that
is left of his tenuous link to reality.
It is a sparse act, with not more than
five dancers on stage at any one time,
but the result is an intensely affecting
one, helped by Max Richter’s
beautifully flowing score.
It is unfortunate that the three acts
were not more connected to each
other – it seemed instead like three
separate mini ballet performances.
After the very moving first act,
the second, supposedly based on
Orlando, came as a surprise, with
laser beams slicing through space
and time and troops of androgynous
dancers marching up and down the
stage in golden bodysuits complete
with ruffs and tutus. It was more of
an impression of Orlando’s time-
travelling narrative and gender
fluidity, rather than a faithful
interpretation. McGregor, known
precisely for such post-modern takes
on ballet, seemed to use energetic
movements both individually and
collectively to capture the relentless
pace of the novel. While interesting
at first, the act got repetitive
quickly, and seemed to try too hard
to be avant-garde. All the fancy
embellishments only distracted from
the dancers themselves. At times,
the score here also bordered on
unpleasant, with whirring electronic
notes and techno beats that, together
with the flashing neon beams made
the theatre feel like a giant club.
The Waves is one of Woolf’s most
experimental novels, revolving
around the narratives of its six
characters from childhood till old
age, exploring their individual stories
but also their collective experience of
life. Weaving in Woolf’s own story
into this act was apt, I felt, especially
since the novel was said to be inspired
by the lives of those around her. The
act begins with a poignant reading
of Woolf’s suicide note, as a slow-
motion movie of waves crashing onto
the shore plays atmospherically in
the background throughout. Young
dancers blended in with older ones,
creating a fabric of the journey of
life, moving across the stage like the
motion of the tide. Ferri’s Woolf
occasionally joins in their dance, and
even dances with the characters, but
mostly we feel her troubled presence
being tossed around the human
waves around her, as she decides,
eventually, to drown herself, just like
the character Rhoda in her story.
Woolf was known as a literary
innovator of her time, part of the
influential Bloomsbury group of
artists and intellectuals. The three
stories chosen in this ballet were all
radical in their own way, whether
it was the all-in-a-day stream of
consciousness narrative of Mrs
Dalloway, the gender non-conforming
and time-travelling Orlando, or the
interwoven narratives of The Waves.
In a way, the unconventionality
of Woolf Works captures this spirit
of challenging boundaries with its
interesting use of words, recordings,
movies, sets, and lighting. Ballet is
also a very technically demanding
art form requiring precision, which
makes it a fascinating medium
to experiment with freedom and
originality within structure.
An enjoyable, albeit long,
performance with an interesting
take on the author and her works,
Woolf Works indeed has moments of
brilliance, but it still has some way to
go in being tastefully experimental
without overwhelming the senses
with attention-seeking gimmicks.
Woolf Works is on at the Royal Opera
House until 26th
May. Tickets from £4.
Available online.
