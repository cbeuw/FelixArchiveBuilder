Your annual chance

The 2015 Student Academic Choice
Awards (SACAs) Ceremony was held in
the Union Concert Hall on the evening of
Monday 11 May.
The SACAs are Imperial College Union’s
flagship event for empowering students
to recognise, reward and celebrate
excellence amongst College staff.
This year there was a record breaking
number of nominations, with 407
members of staff receiving at least
one nomination. The total number of
nominations received was a staggering
808! Over 120 students & staff attended
the ceremony, where eight SACA
Trophies were awarded.
Closing the event, Prof James Stirling,
Provost of Imperial College London, said
“The SACAs are not only an important
event in Imperial College Union’s annual
calendar; they are an important event in
the College’s calendar too... I would like to
personally congratulate all the nominees
for tonight’s awards and particularly, of
course, the winners”
Thank you to all student nominators and
staff nominees, and congratulations to our
SACAs 2015 winners!
