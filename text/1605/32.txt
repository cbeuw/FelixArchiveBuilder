HANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk
One of Felix’s most recognisable
faces was arrested last
night when police officers
discovered the many violations of
public indecency laws undertaken
when posing for the newspaper’s well-
known Centrefold spread.
Investigators’ suspicions were
aroused when they were searching the
Felix basement following anonymous
reports that the Deputy President
(Hugs and Tampons) had been
kidnapped by the Felix Editor-in-
Chief.

further reporting on the rumours of the
Deputy President (Hugs and Tampons)’s
kidnapping by the Felix Editor, as she’s

Felix withdrawn from campus over
Imperial Festival weekend
Copies of Felix aren’t going to be on the South
Kensington campus during Imperial Festival. What

Fuck dis bullshit man, fight da power! KEEP THE CAT
FREE GUYS
-@UNGAGTHECAT
This is literally censorship, I can’t believe this is
going on. How can anyone stand for this? It’s so
unacceptable. Has someone told the Union about this?
-AFreePress_IsTheOnlyPress
This is the best possible decision anyone could have
made. I’m so glad someone had the common sense
to think of the children. The material printed in Felix
was not fit for anyone under the age of 18, and it was
extremely irresponsible of the Editor to run the story
without considering the consequences.
-JustCommonSense
Is it coming back after the Festival?

W8 guiz duz dis meen Felix iz cancelled 4eva? Dats not

We shouldn’t fight the power. This isn’t censorship, it’s
just displaying common sense. Get over yourselves and
move on.

BELLO. Thought they loved a bit of Hangman.

Great stuff guys! - Felix Editor
Deputy President (Hugs and
Tampons) ruins everyone’s day
There was outrage across
campus today as the Deputy
President (Hugs and Tampons)
announced an additional day of bell
ringing from Queen’s Tower.
The move caused controversy
almost immediately, with the
majority of students responding
negatively to the news.
Said one student, who asked not
to be named: “why the fuck would
anyone want to do this? Nobody cares
about the bells. I didn’t even know
the bells existed. Why do they have to
make noise?”
Similar sentiments were heard
across the campus, particularly in the
Central Library, which is famously
located next to the Tower in question.
Hangman initially tried to
interview several students on
the Fourth Floor of the Library,
struggling boldly against the
oppressive heat in the name of
reporting the news.
Sadly, the only comments
Hangman was able to get off was
“fuck off, I’m trying to revise you
massive wanker” and “why the shit
are you wearing a morph suit in this
heat? Who do you think you are,
Hangman?”
(Ed: we do indeed think we are
Hangman. No existential crises here,
thank you very much.)
After being ejected from the
Library by a staff member for
“harrassing the students”, Hangman
hung around outside the Library,
asking passing students for their
opinions.
An anonymous DP (Hug and
Tampons) gave us the only positive
response to the news, telling
Hangman that “I’ve always looked
up to Kris and his big bell, and I’m
delighted to hear that we wil be
getting more of both.
“I personally can’t wait to hear all
about Kris’ bell in Felix.”
In other news, Hangman has now
received a lifetime ban from the
Library for “being a massive perv.”
Hangman is appealing the charges.
sitting right next to us and she’s glaring
at us right now and I’m a bit worried.
Send help.)
Once they entered the basement the
officers discovered the News team’s
‘wank bank’ of past Centrefolds
plastered over the walls.
The suspect was discovered sitting
in front of their many Centrefolds,
semi-naked and rocking gently.
When they reached the station
and went to take a mugshot, further
uproar erupted as the suspect began
to disrobe entirely.
The confusion was resolved after
the station chief, M. Asterbate
explained that it “wasn’t that kind
of picture” and advised the suspect
to “keep that kind of thing for the
weekend”.
However, further twists in the tale
were to emerge when the suspect sued
the police force for what they claimed
to be “sexual harrassment” while they
were in custody.
The suspect alleged that when they
attempted to strip for their mugshot,
they overheard one of the officers
remarking “phwoar, what a nice
arse. Think I’ve seen that one before
somewhere.”
These allegations are yet to be
substantiated, and no court date
has been set for the suspect’s claim
against the police.
More to follow as it happens.
