We’re going to miss the Lib Dems

GEORGE BUTCHER
COMMENT WRITER
The Liberal Democrats have
had the number of their MPs
slashed from 57 to just eight.
Members of Parliament who have
been in government for 30 years
are no longer. Part of their downfall
can be attributed to their support of
raising tuition fees, part to supporting
the Conservatives, and part of it
because, apparently, Lib Dem voters
don’t actually want them to do
anything.
The Liberal Democrats entered
government at a time of great
uncertainty. The thirteen year long
Labour rule was ending, we’d just
entered the most severe recession
since the 1930s, and the Eurozone
was about to implode. We needed a
secure government and we needed it
soon; the Lib Dems took a risk, and it
paid off.
Voters don’t seem to have given
them credit – they allowed a
Conservative party into Number
10, implementing some deeply
unpopular policies such as the
bedroom tax and raising tuition fees,
but they also stopped the Tories from
being right-wing enough to hold a EU
referendum. It’s the classic problem
that faces the smaller party in any
coalition.
However, I think the electorate is
mistaken. We will all miss the impact
of the Liberal Democrats over the
next 5 years.
David Cameron is now beginning
to enact the policies that the Lib
Dems had prevented. The new Bill
of Human Rights will require you
to seek appeals in Europe before
the British Supreme Court, making
it harder to reach justice. The
‘snooper’s charter’ gives the police
wide-reaching powers, including the
power to prevent someone accused
of “extremism” from publishing
anything without their permission,
including a public defence. This is
likely to impact peaceful protestors.
They are re-drawing the constituency
boundaries, making it harder for
Labour to win seats, all in the name of
‘fairness’ whilst ignoring the inherent
unfairness in the electoral process
already.
The Liberal Democrats wanted
to build more homes so that we
could afford to buy one. The Tories
want to inflate prices so you can’t.
The Conservatives are going to risk
taking us out of Europe and threaten
existing strong links in science and
industry.
ÍThe Lib Dems wanted to defend
that. George Osborne wants to drive
further cuts – needless when the
Government can borrow at around
0.5%, whilst the Liberal Democrats
wanted to cut slower and use the
economy’s growth and accompanying
tax receipts to move from a deficit.
They’ve pulled the government into
the centre ground; in fact both the
Financial Times and The Economist
Magazine supported the continuation
of the coalition.
So why the loss of seats? Many
people I speak to are upset that
the Liberal Democrats “got into
bed with the Tories”. Why? These
are the same people who also call
for a more proportional system
of representation. If you want
a government that represents
the majority, you have to accept
coalitions. The last party to get half
the vote in a general election was the
Conservatives in 1930.
I don’t have a particular party
loyalty. I’ve only been able to
vote in one general election so I
barely have a voting record. Like
many, I want a government that
is fiscally responsible but that also
recognises the social importance of
the government. Thatcher brought
the economic reform we now all live
with, but we need to use the wealth
we create to reduce inequality and
improve the public services we all
depend upon.
The onus is now on David Cameron.
The Conservative Party will not
survive another election if they
cannot meet the demands of the
electorate. The Tories may have the
economic high ground, they may
appeal to the ‘aspirational class’,
but if they can’t present a fair social
policy for Britain, they will have no
future from the moment Labour or
the Liberal Democrats regain their
credibility.
When Tony Blair won in 1997, he
didn’t settle back into old Labour.
He pushed further forwards, whilst
alienating many in his party, gaining
the support and trust of the public. If
David Cameron wants another term,
he’ll need to move to the centre too.
This is what he promised to do when
elected Conservative leader in 2005.
There are some signs of this
happening, he spoke of “rebalancing
our economy,” and “giving the
poorest people the chance of training,
a job, and hope for the future”. Now is
the best time.
If he can genuinely work to reduce
inequality and improve public
services, he’ll leave Labour with
nowhere left to stand.
We will miss the central ground
that the Liberal Democrats offered
us all, whether you voted for them
or not. We’re now getting five
years of unrestrained Conservative
government and it remains to be seen
whether they learnt anything from
their coalition partners in the past
five years, or whether they’ll return
to their home ground and be pushed
aside by the centrists.
“If you
want a
government
that
represents
the majority,
you have
to accept
coalitions.”
“they
allowed a
Conservative
party into
Number 10...
but they also
stopped the
Tories from
being right-
wing”
