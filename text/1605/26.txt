When Satire Starts to Age

"While the
satire on
the film
industry is
funny, it’s
also most
definitely
facile"
Afilm about a successful, rich,
lonely businesswoman who
falls in love with a handsome,
dangerous jihadist she meets on a
plane. She’s a 9/11 widow; he’s an
Al-Qaeda terrorist. Scenes of torrid
sex followed by moments of rising
hysteria, as the full extent of the
jihadist’s plans are revealed. Will love
win? Or will Western righteousness
triumph over terrorism? She’s torn
between her irresistible animal
attraction to him and her strong
sense of morality which tells her that
stuff just shouldn’t be bombed. What
a dilemma.
This is the script that a B-movie
Hollywood producer (Olivia Poulet)
is trying to pitch to a famous actress,
in the hope that she’ll agree to star as
Amy, the protagonist. The script is
terrible and she knows it, but she tries
desperately to sell it in the hope of
redeeming her career.
To do so, she acts out the whole
script to the listening actress,
peppering it with comments (“you’re
wearing a gorgeous Versace suit,
Versace are on board”). The script
she’s trying to pitch is uncomfortably
cringe-worthy, starting with the awful
title – Mohammed and Me – right
through to the predictable scenes, the
repetitive script, and the outrageous
plotline .
Product, written by Mark Ravenhill
in 2005, is a one-woman show, and
Olivia Poulet is fantastic at carrying
the audience through the hour-long
monologue, alternating between her
enactment of the script, full of false
flattery for the actress, and comments
about the lighting and the body-
doubles.
As the scripts get more ridiculous
the actress becomes unconvinced, and
the producer becomes increasingly
panicked at the thought of missing
this shot.
The pace quickens and, just as
the farce of the plot rises, Poulet
abandons all restraint and becomes
more and more dramatic in the
reading, desperate to get the actress
to agree. The result is hilarious and
utterly convincing.
While the satire on the second-rate
film industry is funny, it’s also most
definitely facile. Product-placement,
hysteria, stereotypes, and easy morals
are rife in rubbish movies – but did
we really need a 50-minute show to
point this out to us?
This dig at the callous, shallow
and poor-taste film industry ends
up feeling almost overegged, not
only due to the script, but also
because of the dated nature of the
topic. Although the global terrorism
paranoia that followed the September
11th
Attacks is still very much in full
swing, the fact that it hasn’t (yet) been
a butt of a disrespectful film makes
a weird choice for satire. Product was
written ten years ago as a fresh, edgy
comedy for the Edinburgh Fringe
festival. Topical satire of this type
doesn’t age well.
The play’s funny, and Poulet is
great, but essentially it’s a prolonged,
scripted stand-up routine, and it’s
starting to show signs of age. Product
is a great vehicle for Olivia Poulet’s
enormous capacity for humour,
and she’ll keep you squirming and
laughing throughout the play; but
ultimately topical satire just isn’t as
funny more than a decade after the
events.
Product is on at the Arcola Theatre,
Dalston, until the 23rd
May. Tickets from
£12; available online.

SECTION EDITORS
For those of you who have been
following Felix Arts,you should
know that each week we theme
the issue.We look at what
articles we have that week,and
then think of how we can link
them together,drawing together
different strands to weave a rich
tapestry of culture.
We will not be doing that today.
This week’s issue,if I wish to
speak from the heart,would
probably be The Uncertainty
Issue.Or perhaps The All-Change
Issue.Or maybe simply The
Grief Issue.That would be most
appropriate given the new UK
government,and their plans for
the future of British art.
For the 63.1% of the population
who didn’t vote Conservative,I
empathise.My Thursday night
was spent googling various
permutations of the question
“how accurate is an exit poll?”
before I went to bed,waking up
to a Tory majority that none of us
ever thought was possible.
For those of you who did vote
Conservative,congratulations.
Your party of choice made it into
power,and now–without the
Liberal Democrats to temper
their more radical policies–are
free to pursue whatever aims
they wish,unimpeded by an
opposition.For the moment,it is
difficult to tell what the future
will bring,although we can make
predictions: Michael Gove will
continue to repeal the Human
Rights Act; Nicky Morgan
will continue to campaign for
equality by voting against LGBT+
rights; and the cuts to UK arts
funding will continue,most
likely at an accelerated pace.
It is this last point that I am
most worried about.While the
election talk centred around
immigration,the electorate
have failed to realise that a
multicultural society is what has
birthed such incredible writers
as Zadie Smith and Bonnie Greer.
Politicians are obsessed with the
economy,but failed to mention
that each pound invested in UK
arts gives a return of £4.The
phrase‘British Values’has been
thrown around,but people
have failed to understand that
so many of our values revolve
around our arts industry.
The future is uncertain,but it
certainly looks bleak.
