Joshua Renken on the protests across the country, and how the biggest are yet to come
“Anti-austerity” riots break out in
Whitehall and beyond
Hundreds of anti-austerity
protesters took part in
impromptu protests
across the UK on Saturday, with a
London rally starting outside the
Conservative Party headquarters.
Protestors threw traffic cones,
smoke bombs and other objects at the
police in central London, angry that
the Conservatives won the general
election.
Thousands gathered in the
impromptu protests, where Officers
in riot gear clashed with a “minority”
of protesters who were demonstrating
against further austerity cuts to
public services. The police described
the protest as an “unplanned”
demonstration.
A police investigation is also
under way after the phrase “Fuck
Tory Scum” was graffitied onto
the Women’s War Memorial in
Whitehall. This comes just as
the Queen attended a service of
thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey
to mark the 70th
anniversary of VE
Day – the end of World War Two in
Europe.
A Downing Street spokesman
condemned the graffiti as “a
despicable display of disrespect for
those who fought and died for their
country”.
In a statement, the Met said that
12 people were arrested on suspicion
of violent disorder and three for
assault on police. Of the 15 arrested,
14 have been bailed pending further
enquiries including a full review
of CCTV footage and a 24-year-old
man remains in custody after being
arrested on suspicion of assault on
police.
Two officers were treated at hospital
after the clash with protestors, while
three other officers were assaulted
but did not go to hospital. There
have been no reported injuries to any
protesters.
Chief Superintendent Gerry
Campbell said the vast majority of
protestors had taken part peacefully,
but added that a “small minority” had
been intent on causing disorder.
“We have launched an
investigation into criminal damage
to the Women in World War Two
Memorial. This is particularly
abhorrent considering we are
celebrating the 70th
anniversary of VE
Day,” he said.
A similar, albeit smaller, rally
against austerity took place in Cardiff
over the weekend. Roughly 200
people were protesting, including the
singer Charlotte Church.
In Bristol on Thursday, thousands
also took to the streets in a more
peaceful anti-austerity demo.
Campaigners turned out in droves
to oppose the £12bn welfare cut the
Conservative party plans in a bid to
eradicate the deficit by 2018.
Although there were no arrests,
major traffic delays were caused
around the centre of Bristol
throughout the evening.
The former leader of the
Conservatives on Bristol City Council,

Peter Abraham, told the BBC he was
disappointed the march was taking
place.
“I don’t accept this word austerity,”
he said.
“This is the far left and the rag-tag
and bobtail of protest groups coming
together and just making a fuss.
“Perhaps they are doing it because
they don’t like the [election] result
but the people spoke and that’s
democracy.”
More protests are being planned
for the following months, with The
People’s Assembly against Austerity
hosting events online to encourage
protesting in May and June. The
group is also thought to be behind the
London protests that took place last
weekend, although that hasn’t been
confirmed.
The People’s Assembly against
Austerity have posted an event
on facebook for May 27th
, calling
for a protest starting outside of
10 Downing Street and moving
down to the Emmanuel Centre in
Westminster during the evening of
the Queen’s Speech.
They have also called for a National
Demonstration on June 20th
, starting
outside the Bank of England. The
group states: “With the Tories going it
alone in government we know exactly
what to expect.
“More nasty, destructive cuts to the
things ordinary people care about –
NHS, the welfare state, education and
public services.”
