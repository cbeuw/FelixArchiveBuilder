Falling for The Falling
The Falling is written and
directed by Carol Morley,
whose first feature film was the
moving docudrama, Dreams of a Life.
Set in 1969, The Falling centres on
a bizarre fainting epidemic at an
English girls school.
Although this is a fictional account,
there are records of similar episodes
throughout history and Morley based
this drama on such events.
Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones)
plays Lydia Lambert, the confused
and angry teenage girl at the heart of
the outbreak.
Talented newcomer Florence Pugh
is Lydia’s charismatic and precocious
best-friend, Abigail Mortimer.
Whether for a modest skirt
length or meticulous punctuality to
lessons, rules at the girls’ school are
tyrannically enforced.
This is not an environment tolerant
of mass hysteria. Most of the scenes
are quiet and intense, hinting at
repressed emotions that could surface
at any time. Lydia clearly adores
Abbie and there is a suggestion of
lesbianism to their relationship.

Last week in Film: Suicide Squad
In the face of Marvel’s continued
success with their Cinematic
Universe, DC have begun
throwing out early glimpses of their
upcoming slate, kicking off with a
trailer for Batman vs Superman: Dawn
of Justice*, and now the first image of
the Suicide Squad all together.
David Ayer posted the group shot
to his Twitter account, giving fans
their first glimpse of Margot Robbie’s
Harley Quinn, alongside Will Smith
as Deadshot, Jai Courtenay as Captain
Boomerang, and a heavily made-up
Cara Delevigne as Enchantress.
This all follows on from the first
image of Ayer’s Joker, as played
by Jared Leto. That image caused
some controversy (as all these things
are bound to do), with some fans
decrying the tattoos sported by
this new iteration of the character.
The backlash wasn’t that far off
that caused by the announcement
of Heath Ledger in the role for
Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight, so
until actual video of Leto in the role
judgement can probably be witheld.
The group shot is an interesting
one, though. It’s mostly composed
of Ayer’s trademark gritty, grungy
style, with the characters’ appearences
reflecting that. It’s all dark greys and
greens and not much colour.
Harley Quinn looks like the only
one to have actually sprung from a
comic book, so seeing her play off
the other Squad members, as well as
the Joker (and Ben Affleck’s Batman,
who’s making an appearence) could be
the real highligh of the film. Robbie is
one to watch, after all.
*Again: yes, that is the real title.
This week
at Imperial
Cinema
This week at Imperial Cinema
we’ve got a trio of cinematic
treats for you,from a sci-fi classic
to a new masterpiece of horror.
First up,it’s Ridley Scott’s Blade
Runner,as part of this year’s
re-release of the 2007‘Final Cut’
by Scott.
This is the definitive version of
the classic film,starring Harrison
Ford as Rick Deckard,a retired
Replicant Hunter.Forced out of
retirement to hunt four escaped
Replicants,he encounters the
mysterious Rachael,and starts to
question his own existence...
Next,we’ve got Disney’s latest
film,BigHero6,based on the
Marvel comics of the same name.
Hiro Hamada is a prodigy with
robotics,but he spends his days
participating in illegal bot fights.
Rescued by his older brother,
and introduced to a world of
possibilities,he gets to meet the
lovable nurse robot Baymax.
When tragedy strikes,Hiro
must track down a whole new
kind of threat.
Finally,we’re also showing It
Follows, a brand new horror film.
To say too much about it would
spoil it,but it might just rival The
Babadook for‘best horror this
decade’.

"It’s odd and
disturbing,
exploring
themes of
repression
[and] sexual
curiousity."
"This is
not an
environment
tolerant
of mass
hysteria"
many strengths is that she writes her
minor characters with the same care
that she would give her protagonists.
Greta Scacchi gives a confident
performance as Lydia and Abbie’s
snarling form tutor; and the
wonderful Maxine Peake plays
Lydia’s affectionless mother.
The spooky and downbeat film
score is composed by Tracey Thorn,
of Everything But the Girl.
The instrumentation is sparse,
mainly relying on acoustic guitar, a
low, clear singing voice, and the kind
of instruments you might find in a
school music lesson.
The result is a soundtrack that
doesn’t intrude on the drama,
signposting what will happen next;
it is a part of the atmosphere itself,
heightening the action at times, but
not afraid to lapse into silence.
The Falling is a great
accomplishment by Morley. It’s odd
and disturbing, exploring themes of
repression, sexual curiosity and the
grey areas between what is and is not
real.
The performances are engaging,
particularly from Pugh and Williams;
and the scenery is beautifully shot,
the country landscapes looking like
paintings.
There’s nothing else like The Falling
in cinemas at the moment so don’t
miss out. It’s a haunting film which
will stay with you for days after
you’ve watched it.
