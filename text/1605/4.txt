Campus was swarmed by 15,000
visitors last weekend as the
fourth annual Imperial Festival
took place.Hosted by Imperial College
London, the festival is a celebration
of all things science, technology
and arts, featuring interactive
exhibits, workshops, talks, tours and
performances.
The goal of Imperial Festival is to
showcase the work of Imperial College
scientists, enabling visitors to engage
with them directly to learn about
their research.This year’s Festival ran
over the whole weekend for the first
time on Saturday 9th
and Sunday 10th
May.
Over the weekend a number of
scientists gave talks presenting
their work, including Dr Robin
Carhart-Harris from the Department
of Medicine who spoke about his
unconventional research which
involves studying the effects of
psychedelic drugs on the brain in
order to develop new treatments for
conditions like depression.
Dr Rebecca Bell gave an engaging
talk about earthquake science,
explaining how modern technology
like GPS is being used to investigate
new types of earthquakes which
release energy over a long period,
potentially triggering larger
traditional quakes like the one which
devastated parts of Japan in 2011.
Work from the Robot Vision
Research Group and the Dyson
Robotics Laboratory was presented
by Professor Andrew Davison,
who showed the audience the latest
developments in Simultaneous
Localisation and Mapping which
could someday be part of domestic
humanoid robots.
There were also talks on genetics,
government science funding,
performance anxiety treatments,
pandemics, economics and frogs. On
Sunday the Business School presented
a series of short talks featuring
“snippets of contemporary business
insight”.
Tours of the Civil Engineering
Structures Laboratory, the Hamlyn
Centre for Robotic Surgery, the in-
house recycling plant CompPod and
the industrial Carbon Capture Pilot
Plant.
Visitors were also able to have a go
at flying on Imperial’s full motion
flight simulator, which is used to
study aircraft performance.
Almost 1,000 Imperial alumni
and their guests took part in the
annual Alumni Weekend, which
ran alongside the festival providing
opportunities for alumni to reconnect
with classmates and explore what
Imperial has to offer today.
The Festival relies on a large
number of student volunteers, who
"Imperial’s
fleet of
antique car
mascots
were out on
show near
the Festival
entrance"
"The
Band of
Household
Cavalry
were one
of several
musical
acts to
perform
at the
festival."
help run interactive exhibits, greet
and direct visitors, guide tour groups,
hand out leaflets and get things ready
behind the scenes. “I looked after
the Band of Household Cavalry on
Saturday and it was amazing to have
such prestigious guests to open the
festival!” says volunteer Michael Yat
Kit Chung.
“It’s great to see so many children
around as well – hopefully we
have inspired them to be future
scientists and engineers!”. The Band
of Household Cavalry were one of
several musical acts to perform at the
festival, alongside Geekpop songster
Johnny Berliner and two of Imperial’s
student a cappella groups, The
Imperielles and The Techtonics.
Splitting events up into multiple
themed zones, the campus was filled
with interactive exhibits for young
and old visitors to enjoy. In the
marquee on Queen’s Lawn there was
the Research Zone, where many of
Imperial’s departmental research
groups set up stalls with games and
opportunities to see new technologies
in action.
There was the Brain Zone in
Sherfield Building, the Robot Zone in
Sir Alexander Fleming Building, the
Light Zone in the Great Hall and the
popular Superbug Zone in the Flowers
Building, where visitors could learn
about everything “from ancient
bacteria to toxic fungi”.
The College invited a team of
‘Science Buskers’ led by Dr Simon
Foster to entertain crowds with on-
the-spot demonstrations alongside
balloon performers, bubbleologists
and a cast of famous historical figures
from science who roamed the festival
campus.
Imperial’s fleet of antique car
mascots were out on show near the
Festival entrance, with volunteers
from the Motor Clubs explaining
their history; George the Mechanical
Dragon was also parading around
campus, amusing visitors.
The Food Zone featured stalls
from the London Farmer’s Market
and a College-run barbeque, and
drinks were available at Imperial’s
“pop-up pub”, the Haemo Globe Inn.
The College also sold merchandise
including limited edition Imperial
Festival T-shirts and bags.
