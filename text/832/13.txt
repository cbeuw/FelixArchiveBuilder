Easter
For Christians, the Easter stories are
the stories of how Jesus Christ rose
from the dead and showed himself
to his followers. But the word
'Easter' comes from the name of a
germanic pagan goddess Eostre or
Eastre. Her name means 'the dawn'
and her festival, that took place
every spring, was about light and
waking up to new life.
It was probably Saint Bede ( A D
673-735) from Jarrow in the north-
east of England who first joined the
two festivals together. It was one
way of converting the pagans to
Christianity. This was the beginning
of Easter as we know it.
The Easter Egg
\ o w a d a y s chocolate eggs are
probably favorites for Easter, but
this is a relatively recent addition.
For thousands of years people have
given hard-boiled or 'blown' eggs to
one another as gifts in spring.
Especially in Eastern European
countries, a lot of time and care goes
into decorating these gifts. They can
last for many generations, some
becoming family heirlooms.
For Christians they quickly came
to have a special meaning. They are
a sign of new life which is just about
to break out. On Easter morning the
rolling away of the stone was like
the breaking of an egg.
In the Middle Ages it was the
custom not to eat eggs during Lent.
The custom of boiled eggs for
breakfast on Easter morning still
goes on. For a long time it was
literally a breaking of the fast.
The Easter Bunny
In many countries the Easter Bunny
is said to bring the Easter eggs.
These are h i d d e n in various
locations in the home and children
go on an 'Easter Egg Hunt'. This
might be the most enjoyable Easter
past-time, however the use of
young rabbits as a symbol for Easter
is probably based on a mistake.
Traditionally it was the hare, not the
rabbit, which was associated with
Easter.
Some may have come across the
Easter hare in the Hare Pie
Scramble. The story of this custom
is about a lady who, many centuries
ago, was chased by a bull whilst
crossing a field. She was only saved
from being gored to death when a
hare ran across the path of the bull
causing it to hesitate. In gratitude
the woman gave some land to the
church on condition that the rector
of the parish should distribute two
hare pies to the parishioners every
\ ear;
â€¢ J
Making hare pie seems a strange
way of showing gratitude to hares,
but does not stray far from the
original reason for their presence in
Easter. The hare was almost
certainly used as the festival sacrifice
to Eostre.
The Empty Tomb
By far the largest part of the Easter
week centres around an empty
tomb. W h y is such colossal
importance attached to this tomb?
Because the body of a man called
Jesus Christ was meant to be in it,
and because this event causes
Christianity to stand or fall.
So what is said to have taken place
on that first Easter Day? Jesus had
died, executed on a Roman cross
two days before. He had been taken
down from the cross shortly before
the Jewish day of rest (the Sabbath)
by Joseph of A r i m a t h e a a n d
Nicodemus, who had hurriedly
placed his body in a tomb.
Once the Sabbath was over, a
group of women made their way
down to the tomb to complete the
last funeral rites. They found the
stone sealing it rolled away and the
body gone. Not wanting their
expensive funeral spices to go to
waste they tried to find out where
the body was.
Jesus later appeared to two of his
friends as they were walking down
the Emmaus road. N o one believed
them. Then Jesus appeared to all the
disciples apart from Thomas.
Thomas didn't believe them. (Here
is the original 'doubting Thomas'.)
Then Jesus appeared to Thomas.
A m o n g s t apparations a n d
resurrections most of us just get lost
or consider it non-scientific
nonsense, but many have spent
much time and effort, trying to
prove or disprove the Easter Tomb
Story. In the end they almost all
come up with four main alternatives
that have to be considered. They are
as follows:
1) A Swoon by Jesus
After being whipped, nailed to a
cross, speared in the side, Jesus was
registered as dead by the Romans,
although he only lapsed into
unconsciousness. Then after three
days in the tomb, he got out of his
grave wrappings, pushed away the
stone blocking the tomb entrance,
gave the Roman guard the slip and
sought out his depressed disciples
to successfully persuade them he
had risen from the dead.
2) A Fraud by Others
(Well if the Pharisees had taken the
body, they would have doubtlessly
produced it at the claims made by
the disciples of the risen Christ. So
most consider if a fraud, then the
disciples did it.)
After beating back the Roman
guard, the disciples rolled away the
stone, took Jesus' grave clothes off
to leave them behind, and then
went and d u m p e d the body
somewhere. Later they were to be
seen beaming with joy and saying
Jesus Christ was alive.
3) Hallucinations by Bereaved
Followers
The depression of Jesus' friends
caused them to start hallucinating.
None of them ever got to the right
tomb, they just thought it was his
in their mental confusion. Others
then had hallucinations of Jesus
appearing to them. These were so
i'real' that even the unbelieving
Thomas got caught up in them. A n d
ithen s u d d e n l y all their
hallucinations stopped.
|4) A Miracle by G o d
The story is as told in the four
Gospel accounts, and G o d raised
Jesus from the dead.
Chuck Colson was an associate of
former US president Richard Nixon.
He was involved with Nixon in the
Watergate scandal of the seventies,
and along with other conspiritors,
he was sent to prison. After prison
he spoke about Christianity and the
iforty years in which Christ's
disciples never backed down on
their witness to the resurrection.
Colson knew from Watergate, that
the truth has a way of slipping out.
;'We couldn't hold our stories
^together for three weeks under the
.pressure.' he said,' I was around the
"most powerful men in the world,
.but we couldn't hold the lie. If the
resurrection wasn't true, those
idisciples could never have held out.
Someone would have dug out the
tape or s o m e t h i n g ! '
But why spend any time on Easter
ibothering about an empty tomb?
!Surely there are more interesting
(things to do centred around Easter
:?ggs and bunnies.
