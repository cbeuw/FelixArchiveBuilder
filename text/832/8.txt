N e p a l is the h o m e of the
Abominable Snowman, hashish,
Buddha, and of course Mount
Everest, which rises majestically
from the snowy Himalayas. The
country is small and rectangular-
shaped. Squashed between the
hulks of India and China it wisely
adopts its foreign policies to
compromise between the two
countries.
When I first arrived in Kathmandu
I reeled with culture shock. The
airport steps were covered with spit
and the crowds of people who had
come to greet the plane filled the air
w i t h violent and drawn-out
hawking.
Kathmandu is noticable for its
wide ranging ethnic background;
there were the slightly Mongoloid
Newars, the original inhabitants of
the Kathmandu Valley, the dark,
Caucasian peoples f r o m the-
Ganges, and the strongly
Mongoloid Tibetans, but do not be
surprised to see roughly clad aging
hippies walking the streets - the
hangers on from the 1960's Tibetan
day dreams.
Lurching about in the back of the
Landrover feeling queasy from jet-
lag, I discovered that the roads were
primitive and that most drivers had
not heard of a traffic code. Cyclists
and sacred cows were everywhere
and whenever a cow felt the urge to
cross a road, all traffic stopped.
The streets of Khatmandu were
filthy, narrow, splattered with spit,
animal and human excrement and
rotting garbage; they were always
packed with people.
Here pagoda-shaped temples,
with the ever-present pair of blue
eyes painted on their golden towers,
a Nepali-type number one painted
under them to remind the people of
their faith, shocked me with their
erotic wooden carvings on the roof
supports. I learnt more from them
than I ever did in school.
The predominent religion of the,
people is Hindu; the other main
religion being Buddhism. Some of
us could learn something from the
way people of such divergent value
systems live in harmony; there are
specific H i n d u and B u d d h i s t
temples in Nepal but most temples
contain images or statues sacred to
both religions.
The architecture retains much of
the old Newar influence with small
Sitting astride an elephant is as
uncomfortable as it looks, I
discovered the next day as we went
tiger-spotting in the jungle.
Unfortunately, elephants being
large, they tend to crash through the
dense undergrowth, and all we did
succeed in sporting was a rhinoceros
with her baby.
In Pokhara (about 200km west of
Kathmandu), we had just about
enough time for a row on the largest
lake in Nepal and a cup of tea at the
Hotel N e w Crystal, w i t h a
magnificent view of the Annapurna
range of mountains behind it, before
we hit the runs again. This time we
could identify the culprit. At an
hotel, shortly after ordering our
dinner, there was a power cut. The
resultant dim lighting meant that we
failed to notice that the food was
half cooked.
Many people travel to Pokhara to

shops on the street level, living
quarters on the upper overhanging
floors—not unlike the Rows at
Chester—with highly skilled wood
carvings surrounding the narrow
doors and windows.
After a miserable Christmas when
we all spent the day in bed,
shouting encouragement or voicing
despair to each other as we took it
in turns to crawl to the loo (I have
never heard of a visitor to Nepal not
getting the runs) we set off for the
Chitwan National Park. This is
about 110km south-west of
Kathmandu.
The steep terraced hillsides
outside Kathmandu are a joy to
behold, but rounding sudden bends
to be confronted by a fast moving
bus can be un-nerving.

Jomosam or the A n n a p u r n a
Sanctuary. Along most paths are
chautana (stone benches in a square
around a pipul tree) to rest at, and
tea houses selling, if you're lucky
tea from a pot boiling away with
milk and excessive quantities of
sugar for about 2p. You can stay at
tea houses for about lOp; a twin
foam mattress, blanket and wooden
shelf all inclusive.
I did return to Nepal, and no
doubt I will again, for despite Nepal
being one of the least developed
nations of the world, it has a lot to
offer. Although people are intensely
curious, they are generally friendly
to the same degree and the old
Oriental mysticism pervades the
atmosphere everywhere.
