Food
^ltta Bread and
Circuses
Once again FELIX is proud to present exotic
recipes from our erotic culinary expert Yishu.
Below is a complete meal as an example of Arabic
cookery. We cannot promise the same effects on
you as happened to Yishu (see dedication at the
end of this article) or perhaps there is a secret
ingredient in Egyptian food.
It is always a joy to invite someone
to demonstrate a few interesting
dishes from their national culinary
diet or dishes which are their
particular favourites. I have
captured the magic of a meal with
Arabic and especially Egyptian
flavour in this article so that it may
inspire you to arrange a meal like
this yourself.
The guest chef, Reem Bahgat, had
decided that she wanted to grace my
table with 'Fattet Makdous' (a fried
aubergine dish served on a bed of
crisp pitta bread pieces) and 'Foul'
(pronounced fool; an Egyptian bean
dish). A little coaxing soon
convinced her to use the green
pumpkin that I had brought to make
her childhood favourite of 'kara-
assal' as a dessert.
The Fattet M a k d o u s is a
Palestinian dish which makes good
use of contrast to give it character.
The soft aubergine flesh sits under
a layer of hot mince meat sauce but
above a layer of cool but nutty
yogurt and above a bed of crunchy
pitta bread. A masterpiece
p r o v i d i n g contrast of both
temperatures and textures. The Foul
is a heavy bean dish that would be
seen served on Sunday afternoons
when one has nothing more to do
than have a siesta and digest the
lunch. Unfortunately the foul did
not excite me after the beauty of the
Fattet Makdous. I have provided
recipes which are based on the
observations that I made in the
kitchen while the food was being
cooked, they were not provided by
the guest chef.
The three dishes below provide a
good meal for six people:
Fattet Makdous
Ingredients:
4-5 medium size aubergines
1 pint whole milk set yogurt
8-10 cloves of garlic
1 Ms tahina (sesame seed paste)
lib minced beef
1 this tomato paste
3 Ms pine nuts
5 medium pitta bread segments
2 medium size onions
Method:
1. Crush 5 cloves of garlic and
combine with the yogurt and tahina
paste. Set aside.
2. Cook the mince beef in the
normal way by frying the onions
and then adding the beef and
tomato paste. A d d some stock,
black pepper, ground coriander, salt
and cook to completion. The mince
beef should not be too dry when
cooked.
3. Fry the pine nuts until lightly
browned. Set aside.
4. Place the 5 leaves of pitta bread
in the oven at gas mark 5. Heat them
until they are dry and crisp enough
to be cracked into pieces. Set aside.
5. Stir a half tablespoon of tomato
puree into half a cup of water. Heat
a little bit of oil and the tomato
preparation. C o o k for a few
minutes. Set aside.
6. While the mince is cooking, skin
the aubergines and cut them into %
inch thick slices. Soak the
aubergines in salted water for 15
minutes so that they will absorb the
salt. Dry them on paper kitchen
towels. Wait until the mince is
cooked. While the mince is kept
warm fry the aubergines on both
sides until cooked.
Serving
Place the crispy pitta bread pieces at
the bottom of a deep serving dish.
A d d 5-6 tablespoons of the tomato
sauce over the pitta pieces, followed
bv the yogurt paste. Spread the
aubergine pieces in a layer over the
yogurt and finally pour on the
mince. Garnish with the fried pine
nuts.
Serve the dish straight away. Eat
on its own or with some pitta bread.
The Foul
Ingredients:
3 cans of cooked 'Foul' beans
1 medium can of plum tomatoes,
chopped
2 medium onions finely chopped
6 cloves of garlic finely chopped
Fresh or dried parsley
Ground coriander
3-4 fresh green chillies, finely
chopped
Olive oil
Method:
1. Fry the garlic i n olive oil
2. A d d the onions and continue
frying until the onions turn brown.
A d d the chillies and tomatoes.
Continue frying for several minutes
on medium heat.
3. A d d the beans from the cans.
Salt, pepper and ground coriander
to taste. Simmer until beans are well
heated or transfer to an oven proof
dish in a hot oven to be heated.
4. Garnish with freshly chopped
parsley and serve.
The dessertâ€”Kara-assal
Ingredients:
1.5lbs of green pumpkin, skinned
and cut into small cubes
1 cup of water
'A cup caster sugar
3 Ms raisins
2 this walnuts, chopped
Ingredients for bechamel sauce
without the salt (milk, white flour,
butter, sugar)
Method:
1. Place the pumpkin, water and
caster sugar in a pan and put over
a low flame.
2. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally.
3. Mash the pumpkin into a pulp
and add the raisins.
4. Spread the mash into a 6 inch
square tray.
5. Prepare about half a pint of
bechamel sauce.
6. Pour the bechamel sauce over the
pumpkin layer in the trav and
garnish with chopped walnuts
and or almonds.
7. Cook under a grill or in a very hot
oven (gas mark 6) until the
bechamel sauce develops a rouge
colour all over its surface. Be careful
not to burn this.
Serving
The Kara-assal is normally chilled in
the refrigerator before being eaten,
but I found it very enjoyable straight
from the oven.
I would like to dedicate this article
to Reem for being a temptress of the
palate. After enjoying such an idyllic
lunch at the hands of a lady I can
only end this article with a rhetorical
'will you marry me, Reem?'. Thanks
for the material for this article and
when will you come and cook
again?
