Focus on women
FELIX interviews three women who deal with issues directly concerning women at IC
Gill Knowles-ICU Women's Officer
Gill Knowles is a fourth year Mechanical Engineering student and has
been ICU Women's Officer this year.
What do you see as the central
aspects of your job?
I sit on Council and represent
women's points of view. This
basically means ensuring that
nothing sexist or derogatory to
women is made into Imperial
College Union (ICU) policy. Also
I'm responsible for providing such
things as rape alarms and transport,
home for women after Union
events. In addition I'm here if
anyone has any problems and fee?s
that they can't approach a member
of staff or Sandra Dawson (the
College Senior Tutor for Women).
My job is essentially to do
whatever the women at IC want me
to do, which unfortunately doesn't
seem to be very much. I have tried
holding 'surgeries' and would be
happy to hold one once a week, but
I don't get much response.
What were your aims for the year
when you took up the job?
I actually took up the job at the last
minute because nobody else had
stood and I felt it was important that
someone did the job.
What do you feel you have achieved
so far?
The organisation of transport and
rape alarms has been going well.
I've also had some success in
ensuring that reports to Council are
not worded in a sexist manner,
because I believe language can
underline sexual stereotyping.
What other things would you like
to see happening?
â€¢ I've been trying to organise self-
defence classes but again I've not
had enough response to make it
possible to run a course.
What do you see as the main
problems facing women at IC?
Firstly let me state that my remarks
are generalisations: they certainly
don't apply to everyone and
everything. I feel that the attitude of
College and the Union is very 'male-
dominated' and that the C C U
activities are 'male-orientated': the
'ten pints of beer in the Union bar'
sort of social event.
College as a whole, but women in
particular suffer from the lack of an
Arts faculty, which is w h y the
merger with R H B N C might have
been a good thing, although I don't
believe it was good from the point
of logistics. I've also heard
comments like ' O h , they won't fail
you because you're a girl', although
I don't think that attitude is so
prevalent any more.
I think women have difficulty
finding other women who think the
same way, as there are not so many
women to choose from, and so they
don't get the support they need.
The basic problem is 'the ratio' and
what it does to the social life.
A lot of women are obviously
happy, since they haven't come to
see me.
Do you think men at IC have
similar problems?
I think that because of the ratio,
some men do. IC has a reputation
for high flyers which attracts people
who work all the time, and it does
nothing for the social life. Women
are put off at school because they
see IC as either hard work or hard
drinking. When men graduate they
can have difficulty relating to
women because they've hardly
dealt with them for three years.
Do you think ICU needs a 'Men's
Officer' to cope with these
problems?
No, I don't think it does. M e n
already have support because there
are so many of them, so at least they
don't need help in finding each
other.
What do you feel the attitudes of
the Union as a policy making body
and administrative structure are
towards women and their
problems?
I think they're pretty good. I've had
a lot of support and help over things
like organising transport home and
rape alarms, particularly from Nigel
Baker, Ian Morris and Jen Hardy-
S m i t h . N i g e l was also very
supportive when I suggested that
there should be at least one female
subwarden in each hall of residence
when the future of subwardens was
being discussed.
I do feel very wary of bringing up
'women's' motions at Council
because I have the impression that
Gill Knowles, ICU Women's Officer
Council would regard them as
trivial.
I feel that the C C U ' s do have a
bad attitude, that they are Tittle boys
playing at games', but as I haven't
been to any C C U events since my
first year, I don't really know what
their attitude is. I also don't approve
of tie clubs, but as they're not really
under Union control and as block
votes have prevented their abolition
in the past, I don't feel there is a lot
I can do.
What do you feel the attitudes of
College towards its women
students are?
I think that College are aware that
women students can have special
problems and that they are trying to
attract more w o m e n under-
graduates. They have a College
Senior Tutor for Women and there
is a Women's Tutor in Mech Eng.
They are certainly aware of the
things they could and should be
doing. I think there is still a latent
sexism because College is male
dominated and things change
slowly.
I don't feel there is any reverse
sexism i.e. positive discrimation,
although perhaps when they have
a number of candidates who are
equally able they will take a higher
proportion of women. I think that
can only be good.
From which people or organisations
have you received most support?
I have had a lot of support from
Sandra Dawson, Linzi Wishart (last
year's Women's Officer), Jen Hardy-
Smith and Kathy Tait in the Union
Office, Nigel Baker, who has had a
very thoughtful and positive
attitude and Dave, the I C U
Transport Officer, who has helped
enormously with the transport after
events.
Do you class yourself as a
'feminist'?
Do you mean in the dictionary sense
or in the 'popular' sense? Actually,
I'd say probably both. It really
irritates me when people say they're
not a feminist. The definition is,
after all, 'one who believes that men
and w o m e n are e q u a l ' and
everybody should believe that.
