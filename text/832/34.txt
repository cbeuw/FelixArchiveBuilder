INTERVIEW
Rain Man
They made for an unlikely-looking
trio—the grey-haired, bright eyed
director and the two actors, one
youthful and sporting a crew-cut
hairstyle and permanent smile; and
the other middle-aged, lacking
something in inches and hiding
(rather unsuccessfully) behind what
may very well grow to be a beard.
A n d yet the common sense of
contentment and relief shared by
Barry Levinson, Tom Cruise and
Dustin Hoffman was there for all to
see, and the reason for this might
just have something to do with the
somewhat s u r p r i s i n g but
u n d o u b t e d l y emphatic and
commerical success enjoyed to date
by their new film Rain Man.
Comfortably seated in a plush
suite in London's Mayfair Hotel,
Director Levinson, sunglasses and
all, betrayed none of the fatigue that
he must now be feeling after a
rigorous promotional tour prior to
the film's British opening this
month. He spoke in a relaxed
manner about the problems and
anxieties which plagued the making
of the film—he was the fourth
director to join the project, and he
confessed that 'If it had been one
week later, I would have had to say
no'; such was the pressure of time.
He acknowledged that there were
always going to be inherent
problems involved in making a film
about autistic behaviour, but
stressed that 'the movie does not
pretend to make a clinical study of
autistic savants', and it was with
obvious delight that he described as
'one of the most pleasing things
about the movie' the very many
complimentary letters he had
received from parents of autistic
children.
However, Levinson reckoned that
the hardest aspect of making the
film was 'trying to see if an audience
would be involved in two characters
in a kind of evolution without any
sort of plot-stuff, and he was
unreserved in his praise of his two
stars. When 1 asked whether he had
been wary of working with an actor
of Hoffman's 'reputation' he smiled
and admitted 'I'd heard all the
stories', but nevertheless remarked
that 'It was never a difficult
situation.. . i n terms of a
collaboration it was great.' More
interestingly, while acknowledging
Hoffman's greatness in the role of
Raymond Babbitt, he refused to play
down in any way the contribution
of Tom Cruise; 'The two of them
make the great performance—it
couldn't have worked without Tom
just as it couldn't have worked
without Dustin.'
This view was echoed by Dustin
Hoffman himself; 'It wasn't just me
playing the part. Tom was playing
the part, the director and the crew,
too.'. When asked how he had
' f o u n d ' the part of Raymond
Babbitt, Hoffman replied simply,
'Just with a lot of help!', I had a year
of research—not because I wanted
it, but producers kept turning it
down!'. It was clear nevertheless
that his preparation had been
meticulous—he spoke with feeling
and knowledge about the problems
experienced by autistic individuals
and about his many discussions
with leading medical experts'on this
subject; he emphasised that
everything in the film (for instance,
R a y m o n d ' s a s t o u n d i n g
mathematical powers and ability to
instantaneously count a pile of
toothpicks) was based on fact, and
lamented the fact that T know that
most of those who see the film don't
believe it!'.
The rapport between Hoffman
and Cruise is crucial to the film, and
it seems to extend to the actors' off-
screen relationship as well. When I
tried to suggest that they might have
experienced difficulties in regarding
each other as brothers (at 51,
i i i i i i f t '
Hoffman is twice Cruise's age),
Cruise (also wearing a pair of dark
glasses—do all Americans share the
same misconceptions about British
Februaries?) merely laughed at the
suggestion; T told him I didn't think
he looked that old!', while Hoffman
denied that it had posed any
problems, although he did admit
that T first thought ' H o w the hell
can we be brothers?". Certainly, the
results are most convincing.
Neither actor (both had been
involved in Rain Man from very
early on and had to suffer the
frustration of constant set-backs and
several changes of director)
disguised the fact that they had been
far from optimistic about the film's
chances of success—as they both
declare in unison 'We thought we
were going to get the shit kicked out
of us!' Of course, such panic is now
only a distant memory, and over
$110 m i l l i o n and 8 Oscar
nominations on, they can afford to
laugh about their previous
nightmares. A s H o f f m a n
remembered, ' W h o the hell
expected a blockbuster? Three
directors walked out, and we kept
saying 'Well, we've got two guys,
•one is physically autistic, the other
is spiritually autistic...!'.
O n the question of Oscar
nominations, I tried to provoke a
response from Barry Levinson, but
he refused to deviate from the
standard, guardedly-modest line;
'I'm so pleased I got nominated, but
I can't feel myself getting
competitive...you do not sit and
think while you're making the film
'Gee, I'm going to w i n some
awards!'. Hoffman was rather more
original in his response; obviously
annoyed that Tom Cruise was not
on the Academy short list, he put
this down to his good looks!—'Tom
should have been nominated; he
knows why he wasn't, I know why
he wasn't.. .If he had had this nose
(indicating his o w n rather
prominent proboscis) he would
have been nominated!'.
However many golden statuettes
Rain Man collects on March 29 (and
I would guess that it will pick up a
handful at least), the future looks
distinctly bright for Messrs.
Levinson, Cruise and Hoffman.
After Tin Men and Diner, Rain Man
should have the effect of finally
establishing Barry Levinson as one
of the top filmmakers in Hollywood
today, whilst also serving as proof
that yes, Tom Cruise can actually
act. A s for Dustin Hoffman, whose
status as a silver screen legend is
already assured, he is looking
forward to his forthcoming West
End appearance as Shylock (hence
the blossoming bristles). I asked him
about the comparisons between the
two mediums of stage and screen;
he said that he relished performing
in front of a live audience, while at
the same time he preferred the
permanence of the cinema as
opposed to the immediacy of the
theatre—he concludes, however,
that overall 'It's just nice to work!'
So much is true, but then again if
you are Dustin Hoffman (or Barry
Levinson or Tom Cruise for that
matter), it's also nice to know you
don't have to.
