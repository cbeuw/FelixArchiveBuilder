Heart Attack and chips
Take-away foods have a b a d
reputation—but is it really deserved?
The short answer is YES!
Today we spend almost as much
money on fast-foods and take-
aways as on cooking at home. After
all, they are quick, convenient and
cost little in time and effort. A n d
there's so much choice! There are
nearlv 7,500 fast-food outlets in the
U K , not counting fish and chip
shops. Fast-food often gets a bad
press—but is it really all that bad for
you? Can you still eat the occasional
hamburger if you're trying to live a
healthier life?
T H E L O W D O W N
The reason most fast foods have a
bad reputation is because they're
high in fat. A n d eating a lot of fat
can increase your risk of heart
disease. Government guidelines
recommend that fat should make up
no more than 35% of your total daily
intake of calories. For example, if
you eat about 2,150 calories a day,
that shouldn't include more than
84g of fat. If you eat a portion of
chicken and chips (which contains
between 45-56g of fat) or fish and
chips (42-52g) you're getting
dangerously close to your full day's
allowance. You might think pizza is
a better bet. Not so. It's high i n
calories and because of all the
cheese, the fat level can creep up to
40g a portion.
What about fibre? Will you get
enough if you eat a lot of fast food?
Sadly not. Y o u only get 3g i n your
fish and chips, l g in chicken and
chips and about 5g i n hamburger
and chips—not very good when you
should be aiming for 30g a day of
fibre. Fast food often contains large
amounts of salt. The World Health
Organisation recommends an intake
WHAT'S IN A QUARTER POUNDER
WITH CHEESE & CHIPS?
Junk-Food Company Cals C/hydrate Fat Protein Sodium
McDonalds (279g) 784 71.9g 42.3g 33.5g 1.546mg
Wimpy (320g) 850 80.8g 44.4g 34.5g 1.495mg
Burger King (326g) 938 7ig 50g 35g 1.324mg
Casey Jones (258gl 663 66.4g 31.8g 32g n/a
of less than 5g a day, which is
equivalent to one teaspopnful.
Hamburgers, fried chicken and hot
dogs contain between 3-5g, which
is very close to your daily limit. A n d
how about that delicious milkshake
vou are drinking?
T H E H E A L T H Y A L T E R N A T I V E S
Fast food companies are gradually
becoming somewhat more health-
conscious. Wimpy and Casey Jones
now produce a bean burger with
more fibre and less fat than normal
hamburgers. If you are trying to slim
you cannot go far wrong with a
jacket potato with a low fat filling
such as cottage cheese. If you get
occasional cravings for an Indian
meal, don't worry be happy. Curries
aren't as damaging to your diet as
you might imagine—chicken korma,
pilau rice and an onion bhajee is
under 800 calories. Indian food can
be high in fat, so choose dishes like
lamb tikka and tandoori chicken
which are grilled in spices and
yoghurt rather than cooked in oil.
You might also think Greek. A large
kebab and salad is low on calories
only about 500—and has about 16g
