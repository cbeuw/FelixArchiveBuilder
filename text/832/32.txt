Twins
Hands up everybody who has been
on the underground recently but
hasn't seen a poster for Twins. What
were you both doing? This movie
has more hype attached to it than
Arnie has muscles. There is a good
reason: films this bad don't sell
themselves.
Julius Benedict ( A r n o l d
Schwarzenegger) is the perfect
specimen, and man of learning,
strength, vitality and inexperience.
A product of genetic
experimentation, with all the good
bits stuck together. He even walks
like Frankenstein.
Vincent (Danny DeVito) is his
younger twin, composed, it seems
of the genetic garbage. Taken away
from his brother at birth, Vincent
has lived a lonely life, through an
orphanage, and now steals cars to
pay off the loan sharks who are after
him.
Julius arrives, looking for his
family, and while his innocence and
naivety allow a couple of jokes
based on American culture, in the
vain of Crocodile Dundee, they also
give Vincent an opportunity to
exploit his new found sibling.
A c c o m p a n i e d by girlfriends
Marnie and Linday Mason (Kelly
Preston and Chloe Webb), they
embark on a journey to Texas. Julius
is looking for his mother, Vincent is
looking for money, the women are
looking for love, the mob are
looking for Vincent, the hitman is
looking for Vincent, money and
probably a little love too—he
probably never had a mother —and
the audience are looking fruitlessly
for a halfway decent plot with some
humour.
Twins was written especially for
DeVito and Schwarzenegger. The
idea came from director Ivan
Reitman, w h o also made
Ghostbusters and is now working on
a sequel. The pairing of the two
strikes an instant feeling of comedy,
the prospect of such opposites
starring together as brothers is too
attractive for the public not to flock
into cinemas everywhere. The
characters are even modelled on the
actors to such a degree that the film
proves to be exactly what you'd
expect, except funny.
The message which the movie
gives is the importance of family ties
to a full and happy life, and the film
is at least successful on that count.
You can't fail to notice Arnie's hefty
arm shoving that down your throat.
Everyone concerned has achieved
much better in the past, and
consequently this film is a
disappointment. If vou really need
a lesson i n brotherhood then
Rainman is on around town, and far
superior. Those of y o u w h o
succumb to the hype, I hope vou
enjoy it more than I did.

Crazy Love
Now showing exclusively at the
Metro, is the startling debut of
Belgian director D o m i n i q u e
Deruddere. Crazy lave consists of
three episodes, based on the short
stories and writings of Charles
Bukowski, known to most as the
character who inspired (and wrote)
Barfly. The narrative concerns itself
with the sexual escapades and
failings of Harrv V o s , during
varying stages of his life.
Vos is initially seen in a cuttingly
accurate, but highly amusing, tale
of a young naive teenager who
believes everv mariage is like in 'the
movies', with princes fighting
valientlv for their princesses. The
mood is pacv and light, as the film
follows the attempts of Vos' older
and more experienced friend to
educate Vos about the 'other sex'.
A moment of sheer gripping terror
as Vos makes his initial tumblings
towards the first kiss, is brilliantly
captured. The tone becomes more
despondent though as his dreams
are slowly shattered.
Vos next appears as a sensitive
adolescent, who is suffering from
the most horrendous case of boils.
It follows his progress during the
evening of his school prom. He is
almost totallv w i t h d r a w n a n d
rejected, bar o n e friend w h o
manages to instil hope in Vos,
despite his desperate situation. In a
scene where Vos manages to finally
From m
y point
of view
By Stephen Berkoff, M a n i n the
M o o n Theatre Club, 392 Kings
Road, till March 25.
Somebody give these people a
decent script! The Volcano Theatre
Company erupt with guts and
power. Thus its is a surprise to find
them squandering red hot larva into
Berkoff's shallow a n d m u r k y
waters. W h y such storm troopers
should be mounting a mercy
mission to rescue this mortally
wounded piece was a puzzle I
couldn't solve. The vigour with
which Fern Smith and Stephen
Fisher expand this play beyond its
false promise leaves the impression
of t w o d o b e r m a n pinchers
ravenously devouring a slice of wet
quiche. This is kissogram delivered
by the S A S .
Billed as a piece which presents 'a
strong u n c o m p r o m i s i n g a n d
assertive image of women', what we
get are the bitter recollections of a
sadly exploited tart. Her's is the
voice of the major role and the voice
of the narrative, (The two being
contrasted as colloquial slang
against a weakly scripted
heightened authorial comment.) In
the first half of the play Fisher acts
a caricature of a wide boy and Smith
plays the abrasive young woman.
She takes us through the contrasts
of love's aspirations and the sordid
and disappointing realities of her
own experiences: waiting hopefully
by the phone for 'someone nice' to
ring; screwing surreptitiously
standing up in the hallway.
In the second half of the action
Smith plays a woman's eye view of
a wide boy and Fisher acts a
caricature of a shy wall flower.
Smith swaggering menacingly as
Fisher loiters hopefully in the stale
and boozy twilight of a Mecca disco
night. A l l of which is carved out
brilliantly in a stark choreography of
carnal lust and gender conflict.
But the rumble of the verbal
assaults is robbed of all capacity to
shock since this is an unintentional
portrayal of the woman-as-victim. A
habitual victim with the backlash'
bitterness to match. She is the girl
with a reputation. She is Mary from
Eastenders. She is the girl who
wants only love and who gets only
sex. A n unhappy 'adolescent' who
has failed to get a grip on her life,
who has failed to grow up.
The thing about a play concerning
a woman who has failed to grow up
is that it has no audience. A n adult
will only vaguely recall such
pubescent traumas and at best will
respond with backstage offers of
' p r o b l e m l i n e ' counselling
telephone numbers. A youngster,
unless a victim of equally disastrous
sexual first experiences, is unlikely
to sympathise with the woman's
point of view unless out of some
melodramatic sense of adolescent
comradeship The show is also billed
as 'unsuitable for children', in a
deluded over estimate of its ability
to shock, thus excluding the final
age group. (Although a few blasts
of dinosaurs Gary Glitter and T-Rex
which punctuate the action should
perform that task quite adequately.)
This is not the feminist play it
might seek to be. Women with more
character, resourcefulness a n d
independence have lived i n the
most patriarchal of times a n d
civilisations. It is a terrible thing that
some women find themselves
within a life which fits with
Berkoff's pessimistic 'Point of
View'. A n unintended conclusion
might be drawn that the kinds of
progressive thinking typified by
women's liberation are painfully
slow to take on a reality amongst the
working classes whose intellectuals
were their original champions. For
women in such a situation a note of
optimism is the least that Berkoff
might have offered in his ill-advised
blunder into difficult cross-gender
territory.
D o n ' t cancel a n y pressing
appointments for this one but if you
find yourself near the Kings Road
then both the venue a n d the
company deserve your support. The
play is only an hour long and gives
you the measure of this enthusiastic
and energetic company. The Man in
the Moon itself is a lavish, relaxed
and friendly pub and venue twenty
minutes along the Kings Road from
Sloane Square. Membership i n
advance for only 40p. Obtain all
