Planted 'shoplifters' show up poor security
Union loses £7k+ over
bookshop deficit
Losses i n Imperial College
Bookshop have left the Union out of
pocket by over £7000. The losses
were announced at a meeting of the
Bookshop Committee last Thursday
when it was revealed that the shop
had made a deficit of £16,771 last
year.
A n auditors report o n the
bookshop alleges theft of goods by
staff a n d customers; collusion
between staff and customers leading
to goods being undercharged, theft
of cash by staff or customers and
overpayment of suppliers by
mistake or ' i n consequence of
collusion between staff a n d
supplier.'
Security has been highlighted as
one of the shop's weak areas and
security cameras i n the store are
reported to have been inoperational
for the past 5 weeks. The extent of
the problem was demonstrated at
Thursdays Bookshop Committee
w h e n U n i o n Manager, Dave
Peacock produced a collection of
goods which had been stolen by
students on the Union's behalf.The
cameras are now in the process of
being repaired.
Bookshop Assistant Manager,
Ann Toudup told FELIX that she felt
a great deal of the loss was due to
'carelessness on the tills.' She added
that the Bookshop Manager, Roy
Hicks, had attempted to implement
all of the orders sent to h i m by
Union Manager, Dave Peacock after
the auditors report.
Cashiers are now required to 'sign
on' and 'sign o f f their till rolls and
tills are 'cashed u p ' every day.
Despite the more stringent controls
Monday's tills were short by £50.
In answer to criticisms by the
auditors that the Bookshopp carries
an excessive amount of stock, Mrs '
Toudup told FELIX that the store
orders lecturers' recommended texts
and tries to judge its ordering on
past years. Tt isn't easy to judge'
she added. The auditors claim that
the shop's bank overdraft of £18000
could have been reduced by better
stock control.
Speaking on the Bookshop's loss,
Union President, Nigel Baker said
Tt is a problemm and we've got to
get in there and sort it out. With the
expertise we now have in this office,
we believe we have the ability to do
just that.'
The Union now intends to change
the Bookshop layout to incorporate
tills at the exit and a better view
across the shop. A n Electronic Point
Of Sale till system has also been
agreed to. Cashiers will be able to
enter sales with a light pen, allowing
for more accurate till operation and
better stock control. The system is
expected to cost i n the region of
£5000.

Monday Night saw Imperial College
Union Council head off to Silwood
Park for its annual token gesture to
Postgraduates. After much um-ing
and er-ing and delegation of proxies
there were enough C o u n c i l
members to make the meeting
quorate. Sensibly, the
Postgraduates at Silwood stayed
well clear of the proceedings.
The meeting kicked off with the
President who reported that, in the
wake of moves by Imperial College
Union, the N U S were considering
taking legal action against the
Association.
'Perhaps we should invite the
N U S to join us' suggested a drunk
Dave Williams.
The meeting proceeded with
Council mandating Nigel Baker to
seek legal advice on wether it was
possible to take out an injuctioh on
lecturers to force them to set
examinations.
The Unions decision to charge tie
clubs for the use of the Union as a
mailing address was vigourously
opposed by 22 club chairman David
Burns. The motion was put forward
by Math's Dep Rep Athos Ritsperis
w h o suggested that it w a s
hypocritical for the Union to charge
the Christian Union (CU) for this
service when they did not charge
other non Union Clubs. After a
great deal of debate, during which
the FELIX Editor cast aside his
traditional neutrality to defend the
C U , it was decided that clubs would
be allowed to use this facility free
provided they brought in more than
£300 revenue to the Union.
Two new clubs were ratified by
council with little debate; University
Christian Outreach and AISEC, a
student business organisation.
It was then that S C A B chairman
Roger Davies decided to play his ace
card by censuring the FELIX Editor
for forgetting to print his article in
two consecutive issues.
Unfortunately Council was totally
disinterested and the move was
defeated by abstentions after five
people uoted in favour and five
against.
A motion to re-establish the Wine
Tasting Society grant which had
been cut by the Union Finance
Committee on the grounds that the
Union should not fund 'a bunch of
pissheads' caused a stir amongst the
now sloshed members of Council.
Union President Nigel Baker
argued that Real Ale Society was not
funded and said that Wine Tasting
should therefore not be funded. It
was the Council Chairman, Neil
McClusky who came to the rescue
by pointing out that Wine Tasting
Society could claim for entering
students in competitions if they
wanted to and that this would
probably cost the Union more than
their subsidy. The motion was
unanimously carried.
'You've written a blank cheque'
said Nigel Baker shaking his hands
in disbelief before heading back off
to the bar.
'Fine, I'll have a double' retorted
22 president Dave Burns.
As the meeting consumed more
and more alcohol the debate became
most protracted and less coherent.
A motion calling for Social Colours
to become the responsibility of
individual Major Sub Committees
(MSC) was however passed despite
Nigel Baker's assurances that the
M S C ' s would receive no money to
buy Social Colours Ties.
'That's just tough shit,' he said,
but by now Council had had too
many to care.
By far the low point of the evening
arrived when H o n Sec Ian Morris
presented h i s report, w h i c h
consisted of 65 policies which were
due for renewal or binning. By now
it was 11.30pm and to expect
Council to wade through all 65
policies w a s perhaps a little
optimistic. A number of Council
members made their feelings known
as they stormed out of the session
and into the bar to play pool.
Shouts of q u o r u m were
fastideously ignored by Council
Chairman Neil McCluskey w h o
pointed out that as there was no
way for Council to get back from
Silwood without the Mini-busses
they might as well finish the
business.
Thirty six policies later, amidst
much shouting from all and sundry,
the meeting degenerated
completely. By now most of Council
was i n a complete state of
inebriation which prompted Deputy
President Elect, Dave Williams to
pull himself from under the table
and present a final m o t i o n .
'I think w e should limit the
numbersh of drinksh that Council
membesh drink because itsh just
ridiculoush.'
Thank heavens its only three
times a term.
