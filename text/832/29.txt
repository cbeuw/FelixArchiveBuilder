Prize Long Division
This is probably the hardest puzzle I've ever seen. Anyone who solves it will have
earned their fiver, as 'well as my eternal admiration. The object is to fill all the
spaces correctly, and the answer is unique given that the last nine digits of the
answer form a recurring decimal. In fact if anyone can do it I'll give them a fiver
of my own!
