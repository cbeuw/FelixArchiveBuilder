Feature
A Room
With A
View
This week FELIX
was lucky enough
to obtain an
exclusive insight
into the character
of Chas Brereton,
Union Deputy
President. Chas
has been kind
enough to write a
few words about
his room in Beit,
something that
we must all have
wondered about
at some time.
Opera, literature and fast women; such is my life
A person's room reflects the inner
depths of their psyche. From the
decor, the subtle arrangement of the
furniture, the focus of attention, the
pastel shades of a room, one can
learn what a person is really like. I
am boring. M y room is boring.
The first thing that people notice
when thev walk into my room is the
impressive poster of me on the wall
in my Marks and Spencer suit
(which is standard issue in the
Union Office). Beneath my fine bust
is the caption 'working for the
Union, working for you.' Obviously
there are some very gullible people
at IC who believed this and voted
for me.
I am very handsome, but for some
reason the girls think otherwise. Just
in case one of them ever does find
me attractive I keep a packet of
Mates handy. They're lots of fun to
play with in your spare time, and
that's something that I've got a lot
of this year. For example, you can
put them over your head and then
puff them up full of air so that you
look like a spaceman, but if you fill
them too much they explode -
B A N G ! ! ! The other thing I like to do
with condoms is put them over the
end of the tap and fill them full of
water. Then I tie a knot in the top
and throw it out of the window of
my playroom in the Union office
into Beit Quad - S P L A S H ! ! !
M y desk is very important; that's
where I play grown-ups. I have lots
of files, and sometimes I take them
all out and lay them out on the desk
in front of me. There are ever such
a lot, and they're all as boring as
each other. I have a file for every
facet of my gloriously boring life,
such as my Passport File, which
contains my passport. There is a
technical receipt file for technical
receipts, a contracts file, a tax file,
an investments file number one and
an investments file number two.
There's even a file for filing
accessories. But the most interesting
file of all is m y 'unusual exam
writing paper' file in which I keep
all manner of fascinating and bizarre
paper.
By the side of my bed are a
collection of my favourite books.
Usually I read the telephone
directory, but when I don't feel like
being excited I read Geoffrey Archer
novels, such as First Among Equals.
I have a keen interest in the
production and biosynthesis of
p s e u d o m o n i c acid ' A ' f r o m
Pseudomonas Flourescens with a
sideline in competitive blocking of
N-methylation in ergot alkaloid
biosynthesis.
Last year I was a bit of a lad.
That's why you can see three social
colours awards hanging proudly on
the wall. I earned them by my
boyish pranks i n the year of
Harbour-Bridge. I also have severe
dandruff, so I use Head a n d
Shoulders shampoo as you can see
in the picture. M y coiffure is
something that is very important, so
I start each day with a shampoo, set
and blow dry. But that's what being
a sabbatical's all about; boredom.
