Opinion
S a t a n i c v e r s e s
There is an uproar in the media and
the public alike, about the novel
called Satanic Verses, although very
few people seem to understand the
fact that we have been addressing
the wrong issue so far i.e., the
freedom of speech. The fact of the
matter is that it is not the right of the
freedom of speech per'se that has
been contested by those who
condemn Satanic Verses; in fact it's
just the opposite ie, the abuse of this
so-called freedom, which has met
with the most severe confrontation,
and understandably so. The
question we have to address is; does
anybody have the right to speak
w i t h o u t due regard to the
consequences?
Do we have a n y t h i n g like
complete freedom? Why do we have
laws of blasphemy and a race
relations Act in this country, all of
w h i c h curb the freedom of
expression? Is there any prcedent in
this country where books have been
removed from the shelves in the
public libraries?
Of course, without laws there
would be complete anarchy. A l l
speakers, actors, writers etc must
have a responsibility in what they
are doing. It's disheartening to
know that the law of blasphemy in
this country is based on
discrimination without due regard
to faiths other than the Christian
faith. This needs immediate
attention, and the right of everyone
to be free from abuse and insult
must be respected, irrespective of
their faith. Clearly the government
have shown double standards in
dealing with the issue of Satanic
Verses. Does the establishment who
sacked her minister because she said
'the eggs are contaminated' and
who spent millions to silence Peter
Wright have the right to lecture
about freedom of speech?
As for Rushdie's book, it is not
about satanic verses. It is an attack
on Islam in the guise of a novel in
which he insults the muslims and
tries his utmost to give a distorted
view of history and Islam. He
ridicules the religious consciousness
of m u s l i m s and is guilty of
blasphemy. Based on his book and
his comments, both on television
and the newspaper, he is guilty of
apostacy. This is an extreme form of
'treason' and carries the retribution
of Capital Offence according to
Islamic Jurisprudence. There are
other books critical of religion but
they are objective. This one is
abusive, racist and slanderous. For
example he refers to one of the
Prophet's black companions as a
'black monster'.
So disgusting is the style that an
English speaker, while commenting
on the book, said T would like to kill
him for his appalling use of
English!'.
Mr Rushdie and his associates
were invited to the Central Mosque,
in London, in October to discuss the
contents of his book. He completely
declined to accept. A Sikh leader
had also advised him not to go
ahead with the publication but he
paid no heed. It was clear to the
publishers that the material will be
highly offensive. So clearly, the
stake was financial. This is therefore
a case where the writer has not only
ignored but deliberately slandered
and insulted the faith of 1.30 billion
people.
Let me take this opportunity to
offer the respected reader a quote
from the letter of the Provost of
Birmingham Cathedral, M r Peter
Berry, who wrote in The Times,
'The West has become used to
religious feelings being 'optional',
'extra', 'marginal'. M a y God's
peace and blessings be with M r
Peter Berry, as he has spoken the
truth in a world of widespread
moral laxity. After all, the real
common ground that the people of
East and West may have is in the
recognition of one G o d .

Is the Oath on the Bible inherently
blasphemous?
'Will you take an oath on the Bible?'
they say, though even the most
ardent blasphemer, long since
grown out of being ticked off with
supernatural cautions from his
elders and betters lest he tell a
porky, feels himself shunted into a
corner and thinks he does his
honour a disservice by allowing
himself to bow down to taking an
oath which they proffer to him. He
rightly sees no ease in refusing for
the extra nuisance it will cause is
something he can well do without
and there is no dignity to be gained
by contravening himself by
protesting he is an atheist simply
because his view of G o d is not a
view they share. So what is he to do
if he is not to be reduced to the
taking of empty oaths?
Here is my considered opinion.
If his demeanour is nothing which
will work to his disadvantage or the
disadvantage of anyone close to his
heart he should vyelcome the
opportunity to take the Oath, he
should grin broadly and say 'Sure!
Pass that Bible over. I'll most
certainly take an oath on it! Why I'll
even spit on it if you would like me
to.'
A n d if his demeanour is
something vital then let him request
that the Court be adjourned for at
least three weeks to give h i m time
to read the damn thing, small print
an' all, before he signs his Pact with
the Almighty. Is there a Court in the
Land which could afford to refuse
such a simple request?
M y point is, of course, that the
Court itself treats an Oath on the
Bible with the most contemptuous
triviality. A n d this is proven by the
law of Perjury, which, I contend, is
a blasphemous law by all noble
definitions of the word 'blasphemy'.
A n d there is little point in any
definition which is not noble. The
Law of Perjury assumes that the fear
of G o d is sufficient to enforce the
telling of the truth but G o d is not
sufficiently mighty to chastise those
who lie. A n d so I say that the Oath
on the Bible is a wicked extorting of
the truth by a legal pressgang which
cruelly manipulates the honest faith
of simple folk and wishes upon
them all manner of neuroses unless
they allow the State to stick its nose
into their business.
A n d to cap it all, this truth the
Court perfidiously expects will not
be freely given unless a threat of
divine wrath is brought o bear, a
threat which the Court itself
believes to be empty or it would see
no need for a Law of Perjury.
A n d even if the truth be freely
given and under Oath still the
Court undermines the position of
the individual with regard to the
position of the State by retaining for
itself the right to disbelieve what is
said, whether under Oath or
whether on your Mother's Grave,
blatently flying in the face of the
faith they expect us to put in its
authority in the first place. They
demand we place our trust in them
but do not extend the same trust to
us and yet at the same time they
have the gall to claim to be the
upholders of Justice. There is more
honesty of intention in a
straightforward Kangeroo Court.
Even so, if I am to be hauled up
in front of one or the other then
every time give me a kangeroo court
which does not see itself as such and
I will hurl my contempt for it in like
manner so they cannot ever afford
to see it as contempt as such.
