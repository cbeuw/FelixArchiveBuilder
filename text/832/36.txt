News Review
Marches to mascotry
Finance, not surprisingly, is the stuff
of which College news is made.
Anti-Loans marches, A U T action,
rent strikes, ceaseless computer
thefts and successful Rag raids all
verify this.
Undoubtedly the most publicised
events of this term have centred
around the battle against loans.
Term started with a lobby of
Parliament by 170 IC students. The
action was not only a notable
success in the area of external affairs
but was supported by the College's
Governing Body, the Rector and
most Heads of Departments, who
rescheduled lectures for the
afternoon. A lobby of the DES,
some weeks later, saw the three
Union Office sabbaticals holding a
seven hour vigil, and leafleting
eminent members of the education
hierarchy including M r Kenneth
Baker M P .

With tedious repetition we have
read about the N U S march in
November, the 'non-organised'
march on February 1st: a notable
success despite the withdrawal of
the National Union of Students
(NUS), the University of London
Union (ULU) and our own Union,
the educational shutdown on March
16th and finally the two-mile long
N U S demonstration which included
a large contingent from the
Association of University Teachers
(AUT).
The A U T themselves have
stimulated the pens on the FELIX
newsdesk on numerous occasions
this term. Exam disruption was
threatened in the first issue of the
year, followed by threats of not
marking work and not grading
marked work. The Rector said little
on the matter to F E L I X but
expressed his disapproval of the
action in a letter to The Times. The
Union investigated the possibility of
students sueing the A U T , a n d
barristers felt there w a s a
worthwhile case on the students'
part.
From external politics to internal
politics and the biggest 'stir' of the
term came i n the form of a
seemingly innocent motion at
C o u n c i l w h i c h suggested the
abolition of Union General Meetings
(UGMs), thus leaving Council the
top decision-making body i n the
Union. Council voted to take the
motion to a U G M and all hell was
let loose. The aim of the plan was
to produce a body of people with a

fair representation from St Mary's,
who claimed they were unable to
attend IC U G M s . The U G M which
ensued saw the highest attendance
of the year, and the 'abolition'
motion was crushed by 150 votes.
A s soon as one drama is over,
another one begins. After months of
speculation a n d rumours, the
sabbatical candidates finally
revealed themselves, a n d the
election battle began. With twelve
candidates standing for the four
posts, the battle proved to be a
tough one. St Mary's votes were
disqualified on the grounds that
their Executive had 'deliberately
biased the elections'. After IC votes
were counted it became evident that
the St Mary's vote would not have
been capable of changing the
election results, and members of the
Union expressed fears that the
decision would have a detrimental
effect o n the already fraught
discussions between the t w o
Unions. In one term St Mary's had
lost their fight to abolish U G M s and
their voting rights. Discussions on
a merger between the two Unions
were dropped.
The internal relationship between
FELIX and Union President Nigel
The appointment of a
new Welfare Adviser
has been unanimously
applauded
Baker remained equally fraught.
After several heated arguments an
agreement was reached, which was
passed at a U G M . Next term the
FELIX Editor and the President are
to 'swap' jobs for a week, i n an
attempt to enable each to
understand better the pressures of
the other's job.
The Union have received credit for
a number of achievements this term.
The appointment of a new Welfare
Adviser has been unanimously
applauded. The Union Building has
received a large upgrade in security,
with the installation of a new lock
system, and the opening of a new
security lodge at the door of the
building. The issue of the new keys
was so limited that the FELIX Editor
had to fight hard to receive a key to
the FELIX Office.
The term's most unproductive
upset involved heated talks and
endless reams of writing about the
possible merger of Imperial College,
which has recently merged with St
Marys, and Royal Holloway and
Bedford New College, which itself
has just merged. A working party
set up to discuss the advantages a
merged institute w o u l d enjoy
decided in favour of the plans, but,
in the light of the difficult financial
situation of the two colleges which
face a joint deficit of £6.5M by 1992,
the entire discussions merged into

nothing when a meeting of Heads
of Departments rejected the plans.
External forces have provided
more dramatic upsets in the latter
half of term. Bristol University had
its main administration block
bombed by Animal Liberation
Activists, and shortly afterwards
security at IC reported that they had
received a number of 'suspect'
phone calls. Biochemistry rapidly
increased their security but Applied
Biology felt there was no need.

College Secretary, John Smith, who
FELIX reported on an
outbreak of Legion-
naires Disease
is rumoured to be leaving at the end
of the year, wrote to all students
informing them of the dangers and
symptoms, and ventilation cooling
towers were closed d o w n
throughout College and the Science
Museum as possible sources of
infection.
The Union has witnessed more
financial upset, this time from the
College bookshop which is £16,000
in debt, with little explanation for
the lost money. The College has lost
vast quantities of money in the form
of computer thefts, though whether
this is now news is dubious. Rag,
however, have seen a highly
successful year financially, though
they look set to face legal fees after
threats to take the Editor of the Rag
Mag to court over the 'offensive'
material it contains.

Shocking story of a
roof collapsing
Politics and finance aside, FELIX
found space to bring you those
unique news stories that tell their
own tale, like the 'woman stripper
in the Sports Centre' story, and the
tale about eight members of IC
Amnesty International Group who
trapped themselves behind barbed
wire in the JCR and ate bread and
water for twelve hours. Finally,
there was the shocking story about
a roof collapsing...Do things ever
change?
