Eating In
EAT IT!
Refectory Guide
There are many food outlets in
College, and they all cater for
different tastes. The outlets also vary
greatly in price, food quality, and
quantity. It is therefore advisable to
shop around, and pay careful
attention to the price lists, as it is
possible to eat on less than a pound,
but also easy to spend upto three
pounds on food which has little
difference in nutrition, or quantity.
Below is a summary of the major
food outlets, along with indications
of their cost, quality, healthiness,
and portion sizes. The star system
is from one to five, with five
showing the highest merit.
Gardens
This is the main refectory under
Southside, and serves meals of the
'school dinner' type. Food served is
of the meat and two veg type during
weekends, but during weekdays
overpriced salads can be obtained.
The food quality is generally poor,
but the quantity is good, and the
prices although high, are not
extortionate.

QT (McNortheys)
Situated in the JCR, this is the worst
food outlet in the whole of college,
combining high cost, small portions,
and low quality. This is a take-off of
the large fast food chains, and sells
burgers, baps, fries and a selection
of cakes. Unfortunately water is not
provided at this outlet so you will
also have to buy a drink.

M a i n D i n i n g Hall
This is o n the ground floor of the
Sherfield building, and is split into
two main areas:
1) Main Food Bar
This serves food of similar form to
Gardens, and has roughly the same
cost and portion size. The food does
tend to be fresher than in Gardens,
due to a faster throughflow of
people.

2) Pasta Bar
Next to the main food bar, this
serves a large range (usually four or
five) of different pastas. This outlet
is notably cheap, and the food is
filling. O n the other hand eating a
full plate of pasta can prove to be
monotonous. The pasta is generally
both hot and fresh.

Belushi's
Situated in Southside Bar, this
outlet serves pizzas, salads, and
potatoes. The outlet is open during
bar opening times, seven days a
week, and proves very popular with
both drinkers and non- drinkers
alike. The pizzas and salads are
fairly expensive, but the potatoes
are notably good value.

Caterpillar Cafe (Union Snack Bar)
The only union food outlet, situated
on the ground floor of the union
building. The food presentation is
poor, and portion size is small, but
the quality can be quite reasonable.
This outlet doesn't provide water,
although this fault could easily be
rectified, but drinks are reasonably
priced. Unfortunately the vegetarian
food is overpriced, and sometimes
is more expensive than meat based
meals. This outlet is run in a similar
way to Belushi's, and has a fairly
variable menu. Unfortunately it fails
to attract as much custom as it
should i n the evenings, probably
partly due to the unpopularity of the
Bar.

For the future
Union Outlets
Hopefully the Union will keep
learning from it's mistakes, and
expand the caterpillar cafe, maybe
enlarging the custom of the newly
formed M T V lounge. Also portion
size could be increased without
large increases in cost. Although the
Bar has been refurbished it is still
very synthetic, has no corners to
hide in, and no confortable seating.
The lighting is too strong, and either
dimmed lighting or spots would
improve the atmosphere. Also I
would say the lowering of the
ceiling was badly done as it is still
very high. Hopefully these will be
changed in the future, so as to
improve both trade, and viability of
the Union outlets. The way to turn
tosses into profits, is to have a
decrease in cost per meal, increasing
custom and therefore maintaining
'current expenditure.
College Outlets
The College outlets could probably
decrease their prices further, and
they have regular custom, so
wastage should be low, and they
have bulk buying power. Gardens
refectory needs to take a look at the
food it is providing, as it is no longer
popular during evenings a n d
weekends. Perhaps more food of
the 'bangers and mash' type could
be provided so as to use the obvious
market for cheap food that exists in
the halls. It is important that the
outlets cater for the people they
could potentially seve, otherwise
the massive advantages of bulk will
soon be lost.
