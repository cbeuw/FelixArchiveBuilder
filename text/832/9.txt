1 T I Revenge of the
\MZ killer eggs
'Much of the egg production in this
country,' said the minister, 'is,
sadlv, infected with Salmonella'.
These words, broadcast country-
wide, led to an unprecedented
nationwide panic attack, the
destruction of thousands of hens
and the paying of hundreds of
thousands of p o u n d s i n
compensation to d i s g r u n t l e d
farmers.
The incident will go down i n
political folklore as a classic example
of starting the mouth before
engaging the brain. But the ill-
starred Edwina may have done us
all a favour: most of Britain now
knows that Salmonella is highly
virulent, c a n quickly evolve
resistance to treatment, and has
been found in 80% of poultry flocks.
In the U K during 1987 there were
about 18000 recorded cases of
Salmonella poisoning, an increase of
over 20% on the year before. People
have been known to fall ill after
digesting as few as ten bacteria.
The bacteria is a mutation of the
'useful' Escherichia Coli (E. Coli)
bacteria, part of the digestive
system, and like E. Coli it lives in the
guts of many species of animal. The
bacteria finds the gut the ideal place
from which to attack the host and
from which to spread back into the
environment and into other food.
One Salmonella carrying chicken
can easily and rapidly infect a whole
flock.
Corpses of slaughtered animals,
and even the milk from infected
herds of cattle can contain living

Picture this: the scene, a dingy
laboratory full of large machines and
flashing lights. In one corner stands
the m a d scientist, g i g g l i n g
manically, about to perform some
hideous experiment on the helpless
heroine. He reaches for a large lever
on the wall and pulls it down.
Machines buzz and sparks fly. In
thirty seconds, she will be beyond
help.
Suddenly, in rushes the hero, his
bacteria, bacteria w h i c h c a n
eventually find their w a y to
humans.
The key to the bacteria's survival
is adaptability. There are many
different species each of which
infects food in a slightly different
way. Salmonella enteritidis, the one
held responsible for Currie's eggs,
is the most common iti this country.
There have also been recent
outbreaks of the rarer Salmonella
paratyphi and Salmonella saint-
paul, the latter affecting one
hundred people who had eaten
contaminated beansprouts. There
are few foods which cannot contain
salmonella.
This may explain how people
become infected, but in recent years
the number of cases h a d
dramatically increased. There must
be some change i n the nation's
eating habits which makes us all
more vulnerable. Many researchers
now believe that it is the fault of the
fridge.
In recent years the number of
people buying a n d then cold-
storing food h a s increased
dramatically. This, like all other
food, is susceptible to Salmonella
infection. The difference is that such
meals are often keptforlong periods
of time, all too frequently where it
is warm enough for the bacteria to
grow. Edwina's eggs are as prone
to infection as anything: the inside
of the shell is an ideal breeding
ground.
If the food is thoroughly cooked,
as per the governments post-panic
smile glinting. There is a fight: the
hero gets the upper hand, the mad
scientist fights back. There are just
seconds to spare. In a last desperate
to save his true love, the hero strikes
the scientist who staggers back, trips
over a chair and falls into a vat of
sulphuric acid. The hero rushes
across the room, pulls the lever just
in time. The heroine is saved and
the world is again at peace.
O K , so it wouldn't win an award
for originality. In fact, the above
could be a scene from any one of
hundreds of films, books, plays and
the like, and is typical of the bad
press scientists seem to receive.
How many celluloid scientists have
advice, most Salmonella should be
killed. However if, as normally
happens, the meal is stuck in the
oven or on the cooker, left for half-
an-hour and eaten, enough may
survive to make someone ill.
There are no guaranteed ways of
stopping animals becoming infected
with Salmonella. Researchers are
working on 'cocktails' of organisms
which colonise the gut to the extent
that no other bacteria can gain a
foothold. This is not without its
flaws, Salmonella are rapid adapters
been mad, bad or misguided? H o w
many have planned to take over the
world? The list is endless.
FvÂ°n when the scientist gets to be
the g./od guy, he, and it is almost
invariably a he, either spends the
whole film working on the antidote
to a mysterious alien disease or
h a v i n g h i s m i n d drained b y
invading green blobs while some
hunk with the brain of an amoeba
fights off the menace. The worst of
the lot are the happily-married-with-
son brigade from 50s American

We have been typecast. H o w can
the general public trust anyone who
seems simultaneously to want to
rule and save the world. Scientists
must learn to communicate and,
here's the plug, one way to do this
is by writing. The FELIX science
page will accept articles from
anyone o n a n y t h i n g vaguely

essays, if they are interesting, will
be lapped up. So if you want to
write something, anything over
