AUT action
to face
lawsuits?
The Association of University
Teachers (AUT) decided to continue
with their boycott of examinations
at a meeting on Saturday, after they
received an increased pay offer of
6% on Friday. The A U T now
intends to ballot its members on the
pav offer and the result wil be
released i n m i d - A p r i l . Vice-
Chancellors have insisted that there
is no more money available for a
higher offer.
Threats of legal action by parents
and students whose examinations
may be disrupted by the dispute
have spurred Vice Chancellors
throughout the country to consider
any action they may take against the
A U T . One Vice Chancellor pointed
out that if Universities did not take
action against staff boycotting
exaninations, they would have little
defence in court against any student
suing them. Vice Chancellors have
previously considered lock-outs,
suspension of pay and dismissals for
staff taking part in the action.
RHBNC
makes new
plans
Roval Hollowav and Bedford New
College (RHBNC) has published a
report outlining its plans for
academic development's i n the
1990's. The report assumes that
R H B N C will "stand alone" within
the University of London and not
merge with IC and that any increase
in resources will be generated by
R H B N C itself.
Courses at R H B N C will be
changed to reflect the more diverse
qualifications brought about by the
new A/S level examinations. This
will entail more joint a n d
multidisciplinary courses which
may involve increased co-operation
with IC in the areas of Science and
Engineering. Greater European
integration by both colleges will be
further stimulus for combinations
involving European languages,
especially with science subjects. ,

1 Students from the Royal School of
Mines attempted to batter down the
door to the Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) Office on Friday
night after the R C S U mascotry team
succeeded in stealing the Royal

Davy.
The three feet high outsize Davy

as several months of
reconna:.sance.
Mr Williams told FELIX that the
R S M Union General Meeting at
which RCS students had previously
been caught with forged Union
cards had been part of the planning.
He added that R S M will now have
to raise £1000 before they recover
their mascot.
'There has been a much better
spirit within the RCS than there has
been for a few years. Who knows
what the future holds? ' he said.
Fire!

large red paper nose to the tower
with the aid of a 'trained abseiler.'
T laughed so much I nearly wet
myself,' said FELIX Editor, Bill
Goodwin afterwards.
