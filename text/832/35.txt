This week I have been investigating
the subject of Dog biscuits. A s many
of you will know, Dog biscuits are
important for strong teeth and a
shiny coat. They contain valuable
minerals such as iron, calcium and
preservatives such as sodium
benzoate w h i c h increases the
natural lifespan of our four legged
friends.
There are many different types of
dog biscuit, for example bonio
which takes its name from Borneo,
which is a country. Spillers produce
two types of biscuit; ovals and
shapes. The shapes are particulary
valuable because they improve a
dog's spatial awareness. They come
in several colours and the following
shapes; diamonds, bones, ellipses,
and squares. But if you want to keep
vour dog's coat very shiny there are
no substitutes for charcoal biscuits.
It is a little known fact that King
Alfred invented the dog biscuit in
870 A D . The story is very long and
boring which is why I must tell it
here. The King, under threat from
the Vikings was in hiding in a hut
in a forest. N o w , the lady who
o w n e d the h u t , M r s Spiller,
happened to be baking some cakes
and she asked the king to look after
the oven for her. But the King

Vikings let the cakes burn. M r s
Spiller was so annoyed that she
threw the cakes on the floor. But
amazingly, her pet Sausage Dog
swollowed the cakes with great
gusto.
This incident marked the
beginning of a Cottage Industry

revolutionise the world.
Dog biscuits should always be
served with water.

Life is full of dilemmas. Should I
accept a £20,000 a year job with
Mogul O i l or an £18,000 a year job
with the Territorial Army, bearing
in mind that it includes a free
company armoured personal carrier.
1 have had so many offers, but I
have no opinion on the matter. It is
up to you to decide and I will be
raising these questions at the next
Union General Meeting.
It's becoming rather tedious, the
number of interviews I've had.
Companies are practically falling
over themselves to seduce me into
their evil empires. I just tell them to
go away; I don't want power, status
or money. I just want to save the
whale. There will be a march i n
protest to the number of job offers
I have recieved next Saturday. Meet
underneath the arch at 10am.
