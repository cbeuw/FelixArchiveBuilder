As we near the end of this second decade of the twenty-first century, it
is a fitting time to look back. What has happened to all those people who
controlled our lives thirty years ago? The obvious answer, and the correct
one, is that they are all dead. So, instead, we w i l l concentrate on those
ordinary people, the complete non-entities of 1989 as Tempus Futura
continues his series:
Thirty years on
Nigel Baker
Nigel D . Baker was in what he
believed to be the important job of
'Union' President back in 1989. To
us, living in these enlightened days,
this may seem strange. Many of us
still remember the banishment of
Scargill, the last of the Union
Presidents, by the Great Maggie in
1993. But the Union Nigel ran was,
of a different sort, it could be
Labour Party the night before the
vote and the subsequent, valiant
decision b y the government to
struggle on with the debate without
them. The vote in favour was
unanimous, and Parliament, the
bane of generations of Britons, was
never to be seen again.
But Nigel's political triumph was
also to be his downfall. With no
Parliament, he was without a job
described as the 'students's social
club of what is n o w 'Imperial
College of Science, Technology,
Medicine, Arts a n d Star Wars
Research pic'.
Historians are unsure of exactly
what the 'Union' did: many of its
records were destroyed when it was
forced to close by Sir Kenneth Baker
after a later president, Red Nicola
Fox, was found guilty of communist
subversion.
At the close of his presidency,
Nigel took a highly paid job with
Mogul oil, but his true destiny lay
elsewhere and within a year he was
standing for parliament.
N i g e l w a s selected as
Conservative candidate for the Safe
Tory seat of Ridley on the Oouse
â€¢ and was so successful that he was
eventually elected after the
boundaries had been moved twice .1
He soon became a'favourite of the
Prime Minister and indeed it was
Nigel who was chosen to pilot the
bill to abolish Parliament through
the Commons. The rest is history.
Children today are taught of the
accidental mass arrest of the entire
and after Lord Norman Fowler
finally removed the last of the
scroungers and abolished the Dole,
he had no means of support. Nigel
now lives in a cardboard box on the
roof of what was, before the Thames
flooded, the Royal Festival Hall.
We at FELIX sent our ace reporter,
Sez Wilkinson Jr., to find M r . Baker
and ask h i m how he feels after all
these years. She found him in his
favourite spot on the far side of the
building and offered him a bottle of
meths as an incentive but with no
avail. Nigel would only mutter
vaguely about 'Bloody Goodwin'.
A doctor, Dr. Philip Drew, was
asked to examine M r . Baker o n
behalf of FELIX. His diagnosis was
not hopeful, before our money ran
out, we were told that M r . Baker
had a severe mental problem
m a k i n g h i m a n 'undesirable
vagrant'. We had no choice but to
call in the Police and we are sorry
to announce that Nigel D . Baker,
former president of Imperial College
Union was officially put down last
Tuesday.
Bill G o o d w i n
William Robin Goodwin was one
of the last of the so-called
' i n d e p e n d e n t ' F E L I X editors.
Indeed, it was just two years after
his term that Rupert Murdoch
bought u p the newspaper and
replaced the editor with a computer.
Bills career had a less auspicious
start than Nigel. His first jobs with
Alpen and the Pregnancy Advisory
Service were both terminated
suddenly and he was forced to
return to the one job he was really
capable of.
As tea-boy on the Chipping-
Sodbury Gazette, Bill met many
interesting people all of whom were
going to later be better paid than
himself. He was, however, dogged
and persistent and within a few
years he was making the coffee.
Bill's big break came when, on a
fact-finding visit to Johnson's
Breweries, the papers entire news
staff fell into a vat of lager and
dissolved. The paper's owners, in
desperation, asked Bill to stand in.
It was a stroke of luck that Bill
happened to be in the 'Tebbit Arms'
that day, the very day1
that it
collapsed into the Channel Tunnel.
He was just leaving the pub when
he heard what he later described as
a 'colloshal crash' and turned to see
the building and half the village
disappear down a hole.
He was thus, the first reporter in
the country on the scene and the
only one to file his report before the
military sealed off the area. His fame
was thus assured and he was soon
offered jobs with the Guardian,
Independent, Times and, the one he
finally chose, with the Sun.
As the Sun's Arts and Culture
correspondent he travelled the
country writing, in his o w n unique
style, of great events such as the Bob
D y l a n ' W a l k i n g Frame a n d
Harmonica Tour' of 2001. It was
after this piece that Rupert Murdoch
sacked him.
Bill returned to the Chipping-
Sodbury Gazette to the post of tea-
boy cum features editor where he
remains to this day. Our reporter,
Sez Wilkinson Jr. tracked h i m
down.
Sez Wilkinson adds:
I found Bill Goodwin i n the
Chipping-Sodbury Gazette offices
just off Saachi Street. It was a
pleasant change to get out of the
town: to see the great rolling
expanses of concrete that make up
the beautiful British countryside, the
vast mock-georgian housing estates
and even the occasional tree.
Chipping-Sodbury is a typical
Kentish village: a small community
of stockbrokers and accountants
living traditional country lives i n
traditional country ways, their only
means of c o m m u n i c a t i o n the
traditional Fax machine.
The Gazettes offices are o n the
fifteen floor of Lawson Towers and
Bill's desk takes pride of place in the
far corner, just behind a row a filing
cabinets and next tothe loo. When
I met him, he was asleep i n his
chair, silly hat covering his eyes.
' M r . G o o d w i n , ' I said. He woke
with a start. ' M y name's Sez
Wilkinson Jr. of FELIX'.
For a second he seemed engrossed
in thought.
'Wilkinshon, you shay. Didn't I
know your mother.'
With that, he offered to buy me a
drink and I'm afraid that was his last
intelligible statement.
Ian Morris
Ian Morris was Imperial College
Union's 'Honorary Secretary' at the
time of Nigel Baker's presidency. As
far as the historians can gather was
some k i n d of entertainments
organizer a n d it was into the
entertainments business that Ian
went at the end of his year in office.
His film company 'Wicked Wendy
Productions' achieved both fame
and notoriety with its original
interpretations many great works.
FELIX obtained copies of many of
Ian's early works. However, the
office was recently raided by the
Whitehouse-Rees-Mogg Thought
Police a n d t h e material has,
unfortunately, been confiscated.
Ironically, it was a raid by the
same police squad that finally closed
down Wicked Wendy's for good,
five years ago. Ian now works as a
doorman at the ' L a Maison' in
Soho.
Chas Brereton
Chas Brereton was Nigel's deputy
in the late 1980s. His progress since
that time is shrouded in mystery.
He was reported to have first
obtained a 'job in the City' but from
then on, no trace of him can be
found.
Some historians were beginning
to doubt that he had ever existed at
all and one went as far as claiming
that he was a fictitious character
invented by FELIX as an object of
ridicule.
However FELIX have traced him
to a small company called 'Cosa
Nostra Properties' which appear to
specialise in import and export. The
reporter we sent to interview him
disappeared and was later found as
part of a bridge on the M1276
m o t o r w a y . Since then three
typesetter operators have lost their
hands in mysterious accidents and
two printers have been found
entangled in the press.
FELIX regrets any inconvenience
we may have caused M r . Brereton
and wishes to announce that it is
abandoning this line of research.
