Focus on women
Women at IC
Where girls become men?
by Liz Warren
There are roughly five times as many men at IC as women. How does
this imbalance of the sexes - 'the ratio' - affect life at IC? Can things be
said to be improving and what are the opinions of the women currently
studying here? Liz Warren investigates.
Women have attended courses at
the various colleges and institutes
which were the forerunners of
Imperial College almost since their
foundation.
Annabella H o m e r i a Pollock,
accompanied by her father, and a
Miss Woolston attended classes in
Natural History in 1851.
There were one or two women
students i n subsequent years,
i n c l u d i n g Elizabeth Garret
Anderson, who went on to become
the first woman doctor to practice in
Britain.
The first woman to actually obtain
a qualification was Elizabeth Healey,
who became an Associate of the
Royal College of Science (ARCS) in
1884. By 1907, when Imperial
College w a s f o u n d e d , about
eighteen women had taken the
A R C S and there were about nine
women still studying at the college,
all in the RCS.
IC has thus never been an entirely
male preserve, but it has certainly
been a male-dominated one. The
first woman to gain a degree i n
Mining was Julie A n n Wilson i n
1963; first class honours in Electrical
Engineering were only awarded to
a woman, Susan Crease, as late as
1975. Yet in other ways Imperial has
been very advanced in encouraging
women scientists throughout its
entire history. D r Annie Whitely
w o r k e d for 36 years i n the
Chemistry Department, having
reached the position of Assistant
Professor upon her retirement i n
1934. She was instrumental in the
invention of new methods of drug
synthesis during the First World
War, and was also a founding
member of the Imperial College
Women's Association (ICWA).
I C W A existed to promote social
contact between women at Imperial.
It had its own room in. the Union
Building (which is now part of the
Union Office) and its President sat
on Council to represent women's
views to the U n i o n . It w a s
disbanded in 1981, its functions
being taken over by Women i n
Science and Technology (WIST), a
Social Clubs Committee Club. WIST
has never really replaced the
functions of ICWA, being viewed as
a much more radical feminist
organisation and not appealing to
such a wide range of women
students. The loss of representation
of women in the Union was felt and
resulted in the post of Women's
Officer being created i n 1985. A n
interview with its current holder,
Gill Knowles, is included in this
feature.
Despite these efforts by the
Union, it will perhaps surprise
many students to learn that women
were not allowed into the Union bar
until as late as 1972, when a group
of women students discovered that
there w a s no actual bye-law
preventing them drinking there and
proceeded to 'invade' the bar every
night for a week, much to the
Some boys and girls
disgust, it seems, of the m e n
drinking there.
The number of women students
continued to increase slowly, from
about 25 in the thirties to about 70
in the fifties, with the number of
full-time women students (under-
graduates a n d postgraduates)
exceeding 100 in 1959 and passing
500 in 1977. There has been a rapid
increase over the past ten years and
this year saw the number of women
students top 1000, an increase of
about 10% on the previous year.
This rapid increase is almost
certainly due to the College's strong
attempts to recruit more women
through efforts such as the IC
W o m e n into Science a n d
Engineering (ICWISE) courses for
sixth form girls. ICWISE is described
by its current organiser, Margaret
C u n n i n g h a m , i n an interview
elsewhere in this feature.
One of the great steps taken by
College in acknowledging the need
for more women at IC and in
recognition of the special problems
they will encounter as a minority
group was establishing the College
Tutor for Women. Sandra Dawson,
who has held the post since it was
created, was interviewed bv FELIX
and describes how she sees her role
in College.
So much for history. H o w do the
women of IC see themselves todav?
What do they think of the social life?
More importantly, would they
encourage other women to come
here? Perhaps one day there will be
equal numbers of men and women
here and the issue of women at IC
will no longer be an issue.
Editorial
When I first thought up the idea for
this feature, I h a d an initial
hypothesis that IC somehow made
women more 'masculine' through
being in such a male-dominated
environment - hence the main title
of this feature. I had been brought
up on the diet of 'oh, with the ratio,
women must have problems; they
all become either honorary men or
token women'.
What I have discovered is that IC
attracts women who seem more
assertive than most, almost certainly
as a consequence of the science-
based nature of the College, but it
is also something that is true of them
before they arrive. College does not
seem to have any effect on them
beyond what might be expected
from attending any other university.
I do worry that College, in its
desperation to attract w o m e n
students to IC may paint too rosy a
picture of life here. Women may not
have problems because they are
women, but they are still likely to
have problems because thev are
students.
A friend of mine who was helping
on the ICWISE course last year said
that when he talked to the girls
during mealtimes and explained the
problems of high rents in London
and high academic pressure at IC,
he was taken aside bv some of the
lecturers and told, 'Don't tell the
girls that, we don't want to put
them off.' Do we really want to lure
women, or indeed any student, to
IC under the pretence that
everything in the garden is rosy only
to disillusion them with the realities
of student life in London when they
get here?
Having said that, I don't want to
discourage anyone from coming
here if they're fully aware of what
it's like. I've certainly enjoyed my
time here.

Richard Williams for all his kind
help in the College Archives, all the
people who gladly gave me their
time to be interviewed and Bill, who
helped and supported me while I
wrote this feature.
