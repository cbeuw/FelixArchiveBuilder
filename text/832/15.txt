The first heat of the Peter Dominic
University Blind Tasting
C o m p e t i t i o n took place o n
W e d n e s d a y , with Imperial
regaining their previous form and
sailing through to the final as hot
favourites. A lack of time had meant
intensive practise over the last few
weeks for the team and this seems
to have paid off with Chris Edwards
gaining the-highest individual score
of 51 points.
The rest of the team (Claire
Rulten, Nick Battersby, Steve
Ciargeft and Kevin McKoen) all
picked up good scores. This was in
the face of difficult and unusual
wines, especially in the whites
where a tricky Alsace was thrown
in. The reds, although easier didn't
include the usual Gamay, which
proved upsetting, especially for the
Cambridge team.
Overall, IC got 170 points with
Cambridge trailing behind on 110
points, and not a bit pleased with
second place.
Thjis win comes as a welcome
boost to the Society, currently under
threat of having its grant withdrawn
by IC Union for the purchase of
wine, proving to those who doubt
the Society's integrity that they are
a w o r t h w i l e a n d educational
organisation.
Winning competitions such as this
increase the Society's already high
standard in the trade. The aim of the
Society is to give all its members a
chance to taste a wide variety of
wine, reflecting the many difficult
styles of wine available. Only by
purchasing quality wine can the true
characteristics of a region or grape
variety be shown, so the Society is
heavily dependent on its grant. (It
should be noted that the practise
tastings were funded independently
by the small number of'members
who attended.)
If the Society loses its grant, it
could mean the end of a prestigious
Society whose reputation i n
university wine tasting is second to
none.
Kevin Barker of Peter Dominic Wine
Merchants interviewed by Jens
Peterson.
The Imperial Wine Tasting Society
has bought wine from Kevin Barker
at Peter D o m i n i c o n several
occasions. 1 would like to stress that
I'm totally independent of the
Society and have not participated in
tasting sessions.
Do you believe that this quantity is
a large amount for a Society like
this?
For thirty students who only taste
a small amount of each wine? Well
yes, that should be about right.
Out of interest. What quality wine
does the Society buy?
It's rare that they buy cheap wine.
They tend to go for slightly more
expensive wine which, by most
people's standards, is in the upper
end of the market.
Do y o u beleive that Imperial
College Wine Tasting Society is an
excuse for a party?
Definitely not. It's costing them
something. It's not exactly as if
they're guzzling wine down.
Do you recognise the importance
for students to sample wines?
Of course.
If students want an alcoholic drink
they could go to the pub. W h y
should College give them the
chance to drink wine?
They're not drinking wine, they're
tasting it. It's useful to discuss the
properties of wine. I could open a
bottle now and taste it myself, but
I'd be far wiser to share it and find
out other opinions. That's what
makes it interesting. The wine
market constitutes a massive trade.
It also has become a hobby for many
people. It really is a recognised
• trade.
Do you find that trie present
committee are incompetent?
The three girls that come in, you
mean? They have asked me for a
discount and I've given them one,
7% I think. However, I don't think
they know the power that theii
Society holds. They could probably
get an even larger discount if they
came forward and put forward their
case.
Are you surprised that Imperial
College Union finance have plans
to withdraw some or all of its grant
to the Wine Tasting Society?
I hadn't heard about that. But yes,
I am surprised. There are probably
other areas within your university
which are not so important as the
Wine Tasting Society.
Thank you very much for your
time.
