Anti-NUS
The Government is planning to take
legal action against the National
Union of Students' (NUS) 'closed
shop' after jts survey of student
unions earlier in the year. Secretary
of State for Education, Kenneth
Baker announced the plans at the
Conservative Central Council i n
Scarborough last weekend, after a
group of M P s tabled a resolution
deploring the automatic N U S
registration of students' at N U S
affiliated student unions.
The last Union General Meeting
(UGM) saw the election of next
year's Union Officers, with a large
number of posts remaining vacant.
Sez Wilkinson was elected as
External Affairs Officer, H a l
Calamvokis as Rag Chair, Adrian
Pagan as Accommodation Officer,
Nocola Fox as Women's Officer and
Stephen McCabe as Ents Chair.
Although there were candidates
standing for the posts of House
Committee Chair and U G M Chair,

A recent cut in the funding of IC's
G e o l o g y department b y the
U n i v e r s i t y Grants C o m m i t t e e
(UGC) has caused severe staff
cutbacks. The cuts have resulted in
a reduction in the number of subject
options Imperial can offer Geology
students.
In an interview with FELIX, the
Head of the Geology department,
Dr Richard Selley, said that the
department will lose 10 academic
and 13 non-academic support staff
between June 1988 and October
1989. The loss may reduce the
.number of options available to
second year Geologists from 7 to 3.
The 4 courses due to be axed have
a low number of students. The
option cuts are due, in part, to staff
cuts a n d the need for the
department to improve its strength
in the field of research geology for
future U G C assessments.
If an option cannot be offered by
Imperial's Geology department, it
is hoped that students will be able
moves
Speaking at the meeting, M r
Baker said the action would be
guided by the basic principle that it
is wrong for State money to be used
for political campaigns when it has
been provided for students' welfare
and support.
Dismissing reports that his top-up
loans scheme had been rejected by
the banks, M r Baker also insisted
that legislation for the loans will go
ahead in the Autumn.
both cases. These posts will be open
to re-elections, as will a number of
other posts for which no candidates
stood. These include Academic
Affairs Officer, Internal Services
Officer, Post-Graduate Affairs
Officer, Industrial Relations Officer,
I C C A G Chair and Welfare Officer.
Anyone wishing to stand must sign
the papers on the board in the
Union Building and must have five
seconders who are current members
of IC Union.
to attend courses in other University
of L o n d o n colleges, primarily
University College, Birkbeck College
and Royal Holoway and Bedford
New College. The students' tutors
are to organise the restructuring of
the courses.
When interviewed by FELIX,
second year Geology students said
that they were only recently
informed of the reduction i n the
number of options. Of the 40 or so
members in the second year, 10 are
taking the Mining Geology course,
with a fixed set of options. The
remaining 30 were asked to fill in a
form expressing their respective
choices. With the forms processed,
the second years have been
informed that only three of the
original seven options are to be run.
The decision has upset a number
of the Geology staff as well as the
students. A petition has been
organised to express the students'
opposition to the line of action. A t
an informal lecturers' meeting, the-
Comic Rag
Imperial College Rag raised £430 for
Comic Relief last week. £120 was
raised by cleaning minibuses, £260
by selling copies of FELIX, £50 from
selling red noses whilst £70 was
raised by the Imperial College
Symphony Orchestra.
Parachute
Death
A parachutist was killed last
weekend after she collided with the
propeller of a light aircraft at the
parachuting centre used by IC
Parachuting Club. The 28 year-old
woman was an experienced jumper,
on her 35th jump at the club, but
died instantly when she struck the
Britten Norman Islander plane, 600
yards off course.
A number of students from IC
expressed worries at the proximity
of light aircraft to the parachuting
ground at the Headcorn Training
Centre in Kent. A full investigation
is likely but a spokesman for the
centre told F E L I X that the
probability of accidents is 'minimal'
and stressed that it is the first
accident to happen at Headcorn in
the 10 years it has been open.
majority of the G e o l o g y
department's staff said that they
would run lecture courses i n all
options if there was any demand.
The feeling i n the Geology
department is that the U G C grading
and subsequent cuts in funding, are
unfair since the review of the
department was primarily carried
out on the basis of pure research
Geology, as opposed to applied
Geology, where Imperial has its
greatest strengths.
Imperial's Geology department is
one of the largest and best equipped
in the country and is one of the few
with facilities for carrying out
strength testing on rocks. The
department also nurtures close links
with industry. In the face of the
U G C ' s cuts, the department is
managing to build up its applied
geology section w i t h the
appointment of three new industry-
funded lectureships.
