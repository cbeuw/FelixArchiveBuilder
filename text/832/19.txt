Focus on women
Sandra Dawsonâ€”College Tutor for Women
Sandra Dawson is one of two College Tutors who has special responsibility
for women, she is a lecturer i n the School of Management and has held
her post as College Tutor for the past two and a half years.
What do you see as the central
aspects of your job?
When I was first appointed two
years ago I felt that my main
responsibility was to ensure that the
needs and concerns of women
students were acknowledged and
met.
A lot of my work is seeing
individuals with particular causes of
concern and I've also tried to set up
networks of women students, so
that some of the isolation
experienced in some departments
can be overcome by introducing
women students to women in other
departments and other years. I think
there is a great tendency, with the
exception of some of the more active
societies, to become locked in a
group such as one's year in the
department or one's hall.
I've also been concerned to try
and attract more women to come to
College through working with
schools and also through the IC
W o m e n into Science a n d
Engineering Courses, which I think
are excellent.
Do you feel you have had any
success?
At the individual level, as I've
become more experienced in the
job, I've been able to provide help
for the minority who have problems
of particular concern, which have
varied from personal relationships
and harrassment in the broadest
sense.
At the group level, it's been much
more difficult. The meetings I've
organised have only attracted
minority support, but I think that's
true of anything at IC.
In previous years there has been
an informal postgraduate women's
group and we're now trying to
establish one on a more settled
basis. This should allow more
involvement of women postgrads
and they will be holding their first
meeting, which will be advertised to
all women postgrads, next term.
In the area of working with
schools and trying to attract women
to I C , we've found that the schools
are very pleased to receive both the
students and myself. I think the
major problem is the educational
system in this country where
children have to make choices at 13
or 14, but we're usually invited to
talk to the sixth form.
I think it's very important to
encourage women students to go
back to their old schools (we can pay
their travelling expenses and
provide them with literature and
videos). I think that women just two
or three years out of school talking
about their experiences is
immensely valuable. M a k i n g
students into ambassadors is far
more effective than me, Margaret
Cunningham, or anyone else talking
to them.
What specific events have you
organised for women at IC?
Well, basically the work I've
described above. I've also invited
new women students to meet me
and other first year students and
I've tried to bring the activities of the
student group Women into science
and technology to the attention of
women students.
What do you see as the main
p r o b l e m s facing w o m e n at
Imperial?
I think that in some departments it's
still very much a man's world,
particularly because there are so few
women members of staff. The issues
of career choices and life after
graduation are very important and
I don't think there is a big enough
variety of role models. The work of
HUB (run by the Rector's wife,
Clare Ash) is vital in contacting
female ex-members of the
community (both staff and students)
and organising lunches w i t h
discussion of women's careers.
There is also the possibility of setting
up a Women's Alumnae Group,
which could help in introducing
women students to the range of
opportunities facing them after they
graduate.
I think that some women students
are isolated to a degree, whereas
men are less isolated. Statistically
there is more chance of men
encountering staff and students
with w h o m they can discuss their
concerns. I think there's now quite
a sharp split between departments
such as Life Sciences in the Royal
College of Science and the
Engineering Departments.
I don't want to stress the negative
side. I think Imperial College can be
an exciting and interesting place for
women to be. We take intelligent
and interesting women students
who want to make a go of it and I
don't want to be an agent of doom
and gloom about it.
Do you think IC needs a Tutor for
Men?
Most of my work as a College
Tutor is not actually concerned with
women, as I sit on committees such
as Admissions Policy, Students'
Residence Committee and
Undergraduate Studies, although I
do chair the Day N u r s e r y
Committee and I sit on the Rector's
Working Party on the Recruitment
of Women Students. I see myself as
a College Tutor, just with a special
responsibility for women.
1 am persuaded that it's important
to have the special designation of
'College Tutor for Women' because
of issues like sexual harrassment
which may make many women
worried about who they actually go
and see, so it's a bonus for
individual work.
What do you feel the attitudes of IC
towards its women students are?
Many are positive, a few are
negative. I hope that by taking up
specific issues and by trying to stop
isolation we can make it an even
better place.
Some departments have a
Women's Tutor, but in most cases
the departments with w o m e n
members of staff try to make them
take responsibility for the women
students. The basic problem is that
we need more women staff, so that
we don't have to set up these special
arrangements. After all, if there is
one female member of staff there is
no guarantee that she will be
concerned with pastoral or welfare
issues.
Do you feel it is a disadvantage that
you didn't study a science-based
subject?
No, I don't. I've worked in the area
of industrial studies for so long I feel
I'm a member of IC, I don't think
it's a matter for concern or
comment.
Do y o u class yourself as a
'feminist'?
I'm someone who shuns labels. I
think they lead to more difficulties
than solutions. Personally, I think
that domestic life and professional
life are both important and I'd like
to encourage women to see that
they can have a strong positive
combination of both. The critical
thing is both individuals and
organisations response to issues
such as childcare: IC are extremely
good in that respect.
I do beleive passionately in
equality of opportunity, and I
believe that with the contribution
women have to give to science,
industry or politics and the number
of women who figure in significant
positions in those areas, that a lot
of talent is being wasted.
