Focus on women
Margaret Cunningham-running ICWISE
Margaret Cunningham is the organiser of the Imperial College Women
into Science and Engineering (ICWISE) courses which aim to allow sixth
form girls to find out about studying science and engineering, and also
to find out more about Imperial College itself. She is currently the Senior
Tutor in the Department of Computing, has previously been College
Senior Tutor for Women and has successfully combined both a career and
a family. She studied at IC both an undergraduate and as a postgraduate
and after spending some time in industry returned to IC as a lecturer.
How many women were at IC when
you arrived?
There were just over 100 full time
undergraduates. Everyone was very
excited about that. There were about
40 fresher females.
Were you yourself encouraged into
Science?
I was neither encouraged nor
discouraged. I was just allowed to
follow my o w n mind.
Where did the idea for the ICWISE
courses come from?
They were an idea dreamed up by
the Rector's Working Party on the
Recruitment of Women Students,
which discusses a lot of general
issues but has mostly concentrated
on running these courses.
They were inspired by the Insight
into Engineering courses which we
ran here every year they were held
except the first. In 86 we ran both
Insight and ICWISE, and we've run
ICWISE for 87 and 88 as well. I've
done the planning for this year and
the preliminary booking for next
year. The course may or may not
happen after that, and I will
probably step down as organiser
anyway.
The 'thing about the ICWISE
courses are that they're shorter than
Insight. We've aimed to optimise
the length of the course with the
number of women on each course,
as it is all additional work above
their ordinary duties for the
lecturers who take part. The courses
last two days and there are 45 to 50
women on each course. We ran four
courses in the first year, eight in the
second year and four residential and
one non-residential course last year.
That gave the opportunity for more
girls to be involved as we didn't
have to accommodate them and a lot
of them were women who either
wouldn't want to live in hall or
would be mature students. This
year all the courses are residential.
The courses, i n c l u d i n g the
a c c o m m o d a t i o n are free, to
encourage as many women along as
possible.
During the course there are talks
and discussion on careers in Science
and E n g i n e e r i n g , Laboratory
Sessions in the Departments and
tours of College and London, as
well as the chance to talk to students
and members of staff.
How many subsequently study for
science-based degrees?
I think that the number who come
to IC each year is several dozen. It's
.certainly not all of them, as I think
the courses have a far wider appeal
and are more general than simply
recruiting into science. I do think it
has been instrumental in recruiting
to IC, though. We've seen the
biggest single increase, 10%, in the
number of women students at IC
this year. I think the course helps in
as much as many girls are reassured
about what this part of London is
like. There's a small proportion who
are put off simply because they
don't like London.
Do you think it is a good idea to
encourage women to come to IC?
I think it is, partly for the parochial
reason that it makes it nicer for the
girls who are already here, but also
in the long term because industry
needs more qualified people.
I t h i n k that girls are still
sometimes put down when they get
interested in science and the
reassurance of an all girl course
helps - they're meeting girls with
the same interests, possibly for the
first time.
What do you see as the problems
for women entering on science
based courses and science based
careers?
If you ask the careers people, I think
they'll tell you they're the same for
women entering any career in which
they are outnumbered, for example
the City.
I think individual prejudice is
probably still a problem, but
certainly the corporate view of
w o m e n is i m p r o v i n g , simply
because of the need to employ
w o m e n because of the labour
shortage. Companies are realising
that they need to provide things like
day nurseries in order to keep their
female staff. There still seems to be
a lot of prejudice about bringing the
two halves of women's lives, career
and motherhood, together.
What do you think are the attitudes
of IC towards its women students?
I think there are lots of different
attitudes. There is still the big social
disincentive of the 'beery, tribal
social life'. The line from College,
f r o m the Senior Tutors a n d
Admissions Tutors, is that they are
very keen that women here should
fulfil their potential and they
definitely want more w o m e n
students.
What is more disturbing is the lack
of female staff. There is still a greater
drop-out rate among women than
men because a career break can be
critical for women. There are only
about 35 to 40 women staff herr
There are quite a lot of contract
research staff but they don't have
security of tenure.
How do you think attitudes
towards women at IC have changed
whilst you've been at IC?
I think there has been a realisation
that we need more female staff. I
d o n ' t t h i n k this was even
considered when I first came here.
I think it's sad that when the
Imperial College W o m e n ' s
Association went it wasn't really
replaced, as it filled a need for social
contact. Women students have
always held more visible positions
proportionately than men. That's
probably because they're more
motivated and more individual than
the men who come here. They've
had to answer the question ' W h y
are you doing engineering when
you're a girl?'
From whom have you received
most support in your work?
Because of this scheme there has
been collaboration between all the
departments for the first time. Each
department has had one member of
staff who has co-ordinated that
department's action, so I'm grateful
to them and also to the Research
Assistants who've helped with the
practical work. We have female staff
staying during the courses and as
there aren't many of them that
means there's been very good
support from them.
Terry Whodcoat, the Assistant
Admissions Registrar, has helped
with the administration, particularly
while the courses have been
running, and there have been
several students who have acted as
receptionists and helped with the
day-to-day running of the courses.
There are also all the staff and
studenst who've helped by coming
along to meals and talking to the
women on the course.
Do you class yourself as a
'feminist'?
Yes, I do, recognising that that
covers quite a wide range of views.
I believe in equal rights and equal
opportunities, but the word has
connotations and overtones put on
it by its critics and it can imply
extremism without pragmatism.
