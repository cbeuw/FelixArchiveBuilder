Focus on women
Laying myths to rest
H o w do the current female students at Imperial College (IC) see
themselves? What do they think of the men at IC and what do they believe
the men think about them? Liz Warren interviewed some of them to find
out.
H o w do you see yourself?
A choice of several adjectives was
offered. Almost everyone saw
themselves as intelligent, which is
probably not surprising as they are
studying at Imperial. Most of them
felt they were quite self-confident
and s t r o n g - w i l l e d : o b v i o u s l y
unconfident women do not come
here.
More than half saw themselves as
talkative, which at least goes to
show that when men accuse women
of this fault women are aware of it!
Perhaps most surprisingly, in a
place where women are supposed
to have problems, all of them felt
that they were on the whole happy.
A l t h o u g h all the w o m e n
interviewed believed in equal
opportunities, less than half would
describe themselves as a feminist
('one who advocates equal rights for
w o m e n ' - C o l l i n s English
Dictionary). This is undoubtedly
due to the connotations of
extremism and indiscrimate man-
hating that the word has acquired
over the years.
Finally, one myth should be laid
to rest: women do not come to IC
because there are five men to every
woman. A l l the replies to the
question, 'What were your reasons
for coming to IC?' mentioned the
academic reputation of the College,
together with some women who
said they wanted to study in
London, but nobody gave 'the ratio'
as a reason.
Women in the Union Bar-in their traditional role?
Social Life
Everybody seemed to have more
male friends than female friends,
and most of them seemed to think
they had more male friends than
they would have done outside IC.
Given the imbalance in numbers
this does not seem strange. Most
women didn't seem to notice 'the
ratio', certainly not academically.
Some of them felt it could make
Union parties unpleasant, whilst
others felt that as the women tended
to be more sociable it was less of a
problem than the basic numbers
might suggest. It was also suggested
that 'it would be less of a problem
if it wasn't discussed so much' and
'there are more men than women
here. So what!' Life scientists said
they certainly didn't notice it.
Most women felt the social life
was on the whole good, but that it
wasn't really provided by the
Union, and that one had to either
be in a good hall or make one's own.
Most women felt their was little
strain in socialising, but some of
them felt that some men could
become 'desperate' and very
'predatory'.
A l m o s t everyone felt that
contraception was the responsibility
of both partners, while most felt that
abortion was the responsibilty of the
woman only, although a large
minority felt that both men and
women should be involved in the
decision.
Do women still see IC like this?
Work and Career
Most people felt that men and
women treated each other equally
academically, although there were
a few who thought that perhaps
both sexes had an overinflated view
of the other's ability. Certainly
nobody thought that men looked
down on the women at College.
There was a feeling that women in
general performed better than men,
but only because they were more
highly motivated when they applied
to IC and also perhaps because 'they
have more to prove'.
Many felt that some women
exploited their feminity in an
academic environment, but that
'fortunately, they are in a minority'.
Everybody wanted to get a job
after leaving College, with a number
wanting to do research. They were
split evenly on whether they
wanted to get married, although
nobody would give up work simply
because they had got married.
O n the question of whether or not
they would have children, a third
said yes, a third said no and a third
said they weren't sure. Those who
did want children still wanted a
career and most of them would only
take a career break of about five
years. N o b o d y expected their
husband to give up his career for the
sake of the family.
It was pleasant to discover that
almost no-one had been
discouraged in wanting to study
science, though those that were
seemed quite angry about it. A large
proportion of w o m e n had
attendended some sort of sixth form
course to encourage girls into
science, and most said that that had
been very encouraging.
Women at IC are self-confident and strong willed
S h o u l d w o m e n come to IC?
Quite a number said that it would
depend on what sort of personality
she had and that if she was 'arty'
she should go elsewhere. There
were a few emphatic no's, but the
reasons given were mostly to do
with the high cost of living in
London and the academic pressure
at College, which they felt was
responsible for turning out rather
odd people anyway. Half the
w o m e n questioned said yes:
London was a good place to be, and
that the degree was well respected.
There's hope that one day 'the ratio'
won't be discussed because it'll be
one to one.
