Music
M c C a r t h y i s m
This interview was conducted at the
Fulham Greyhound in late February
1989, and first broadcast on IC Radio
on Monday March 13. I spoke to
Malcolm (singer) and Tim (guitarist)
from the band.
How do you see yourself these
days?
McC...I think we're trying to change
pop music in some way, trying to
make it a bit more relevant to
people's lives, trying to relate it to
the world and not cut it off like it is
at the moment—most pop music is
pure escapism and has no relevance
lo anybody's life, so we feel we're
quite a campaigning group now,
we're trying to say something a bit
more intelligent in a pop song.
Most of your song titles have some
kind of obvious
message...presumably the lyrics are
developing these ideas?
Tim. Every record we've released
has had overtly political lvrics, but
we think that everything is political
around us—we don't consider
ourselves similar to other 'political
bands'. There's a policy running
throughout everything we do, and
the music is just a framework for
what we have to say.
(To Malcolm.) Are the whole band
behind your lyrics...it's not just you
'crusading'?
Tim. It's Mai's specific ideas—none
of the rest of us contribute to them,
but we all agree to protest about
what we don't like in the world and
what needs to be changed. None of
us is unpolitical, though we have
differences of opinion in solutions.
Would you classify yourself as an
indie band?
McC. Well w e are o n an
independent lable, but as a form of
music...we don't think about being
any particular category of
music...we avoid overtly rock
cliches and so on, and we have our
own idiosyncratic brand of music,
which can't easily be put in any
other category, which leaves the
horrible 'indie' tag.
I don't think we have any more
in common with any group on an
indie lable than we have with
anyone on a major label.
Mai. O u r influences are not
generally musical influences—
they're from art, or literature
particularly from the 1920s: Berthold
Brecht, John Hartfield, George
Cross, people like that. We think
they have a similar way of going
about things to us. A much higher
vision.
Someone was telling me that you're
making a video next week—is that
true?
Mai. Dreadfully true, yes. It's not
something that I find particularly
natural to do..We feel reasonably
confident about making records
now, but it was a long process of
learning.
The video is for our new record
(Keep an Open Mind or Else). It
involves a liberal, arguing with
somebody. A t first he's very
tolerant, saying yes, you're entitled
to these opinions, but gradually as
the song goes on he's getting more
and more wound up by what this
other person's saying, so by the end
he's threatening him with violence.
We wanted to illustrate this in some
way in the video. 1 though the most
obvious way to signify tolerance was
to give someone a kiss, so I'm afraid
someone's going to have to kiss Tim
on the cheek in the first verse—and
in the third verse they're going to
have to spit at him, Tim's not
looking forward to being spat at.
It must be quite exciting—do you
think you're about to launch off
into major things?
Mai. Into space? Probably into
space. Once people find out what
we're saying, perhaps they will
come to our houses and stone the
windows. I hope so! That would be
the ideal reaction.
Well you'd certainly get an
exclusive with the Sun then...You
still seem quite idealistic—so you
haven't been embittered by the
'pop world' yet.
McC. N o , I dunno why that is. It's
a very embittering thing, obviously
all just for money. But we're very
sure of what we want to do in the
group, and what we want to see
happening i n the world, so we've
got a lot of resiliance.
You're all Londoners—have you
toured much outside London?
Tim. O h yeah, In fact, we don't play
much in London. We play round
Europe quite a bit.
Where's your favourite place in
England to play?
McC. Edinburgh's always good
Tim. Well I like London—I have to
have a big city, I can't stand
anything rural.
Mai. A l l the countryside should be
built over immediately and be made
useful—I mean it's completely
useless just sitting there doing
nothin in particular—I think it's got
far too good a press up to now, in
the history of m a n k i n d !
I think you've just lost a lot of
Green fans.
Mai. G o o d , good! G o o d b y e !
Actually... you do Math's don't
you?
Yes.
Mai. Because it occurred to me that
a lot of my songs are meant to be
like mathematical propositions...
(?*@*)
Mai trying to get all the feeling
and vague-mindedness out, they're
meant to be very cold, logical and
precise, very accurate. 1 say a
proposition in the first verse, and
someone will have to go along with
that, another in the second and so
on, and then 1 hit them with the
conclusions, and they're usually
horrified by the conclusions, but
because they've agreed with the
propositions earlier, they're in
trouble.
I can't fault that. 1 hope you don't
lose the poetry though.
Mai. Well....I'm not that bothered
about poetry. Mathematical is what
I want really...The music Tim writes
is very emotional most of the time,
and the lyrics are always playing off
against the music in some way.
You have a new album coming out.
Mai. Yes. 'The Enraged Shall Inherit
the Earth', due out in March.
Oh. That'll be good!
Mai. It's from the Bible—I'm always
reading my Bible.
Smashing
McCarthy s new album is out
now—and the gig was dead good!
Love from Susan xx.
IC Radio have been scuttling about
interviewing pop groups these last
few weeks. Two Mondays ago saw
the broadcasting of a conversation
with McCarthy and also with Jesus
Jones, recored at their recent gig at
our very own gorgeous Imperial
College. We have taped interviews
with Birdland and also the legendary
Gaye Bikers on Acid—both to be
broadcast early next term—and in
the pipeline are the Rose of Avalanche
and Spaceman 3.
For further transmission times,
write to Tom Cunnington or Susan
Appleby, c/or IC Radio, and keep an
eye out in the 'What's O n ' column.
Keep listening—999KHz Medium
Wave, 97.7FM test transmissions.
We're all having a mega-happy
time.
Big Bov T o m a t o - U L U
Big Bov Tomato have dimples. Punk
packaged in cute cladding. Fronted
by a d i z z y gal w h o peers
endearingly through a frizzy fringe,
tassles, odd socks, oversized t-shirt
and baseball boots. She grins and
adore-me dimples appear i n her
cheeks. Surely this is not the face of
post punk nostalgic music. It is!
As with most modern fast pop
performers they shoot through a
funnv set paying more attention to
energy than technical mastery. The
drummer (I'm convinced he was
one of the great train robbers) beats
and bashes baldly. The 78rpm
rendition of Summer Loving gets the
crowd smiling.
They certainly have the right idea.
The only way to revive punk is
tongue-in-cheek. In this way> there
is no prospect of artistically
'spoiling' any piece because there is
no pretention involved and no one
takes it seriously.
They were a guitarist short tonight
but it didn't matter, with or without
they were worth £0 of anybody's
money. See them or eat ketchup.
