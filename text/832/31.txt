The doubles tournament has been
won, in a gruelling and hard fought
final, by Saif Ghouse (Chem Eng 2)
and Clive Roberts (Physics PG).
Their opponents took a 25 point
lead in the first frame but a timely
break defeated them on the pink
ball.
The next two frames were lost
convincingly b y the eventual
winners, with the balls being badly
placed for break-building.
After composing themselves, S G
and CR came back determined to
win their £24 (wow!) prize money.
Thev played no frills, sensible
snooker and kept their noses in
front. In the end, both frames were
won comfortably.
Sailing Club
Last weekend IC Sailing Club sent
a team to one of the premier
University team racing events of the
year: The Bradford Barrel. After a
warm reception i n Bardford on
FridaV night, the teams arrived to
start racing on Saturday at a time
considered by most teams to be far
too early.
The IC team sailed consistently
throughout the w e e k e n d .
Highlights included a win over the
strong horn team Bradford, a
confrontation with Edinburgh when
we came out with big guns blazing
and a victory over the University of
London team i n one of the most
exciting races of the series. We did,
however, narrowly lose to the
eventual winners, Southampton,
whose team included two Olympic
trialists.
After the prize giving a n d
celebrations, including the sharing
out of the prize (the 'Bradford
Barrel') and a dip in the lake for
several people, the team set off for
home after a very enjoyable
weekend.
Boat Club
Ladies Head of the River
O n Saturday March 3, the Imperial
College ladies eight competed in the
Women's Head of the River. Almost
200 crews were timed as they raced
the 4
V
2 miles from Chiswick to
Putney Pier (the Oxford-Cambridge
boat race course i n reverse). In a
closely fought competition, the
ladies came tenth out of 47 crews in
their category.
Kingston Head of the River
Imperial crews from all squads
entered the Kingston Head race last
Saturday, the punishing course
stretches along the Thames from
Hampton Court to Teddington
Lock.
The men's first eight, despite
being given a start position low
down in the running order, put in
an impressive performance, coming
second overall in the event.
Two days before the race, the
second eight's boat, k n o w n
affectionately as the 'Eric Bash', had
undergone drastic remodelling with
the help of some iron railings and
a freak gust of wind. Bandaged up,
he carried the crew to second place
in their category. A trail of steam
was left hanging over the course as
the novice men's eight raced to
victory i n their category. The
phenomenon was later put down to
the animated conversation between
numbers five and six, rather than
the speed of the boat.
The ladies eight finished third in
their category.
University of London Head
Last Sunday, boat crews from all the
London colleges competed in their
own head race; from Hammersmith
Bridge to the U L clubhouse near
Kew.
The men's first eight did not race
after their exersions of the previous
day. However, their strokeman and
club captain, Steve Pearson, defying
those who thought the stroke seat
was the most powerful position that
he could occupy, turned his hand to
coxing the 2nd eight, they did not
disappoint, coming first overall. The
men's novice eight came i n close
behind i n third place overall,
winning their category by over two
minutes. This takes their total to ten
consecutive wins this year. The
ladies had an unlucky race and only
managed fourth place i n their
category.
IC lsts—3
U C - 0
Skipper Nigel Collier was once
again the hero of the day, bagging
his second hat-trick in consecutive
games, as IC swept aside a spirited
U C side to clinch their first ever
University of London Division title.
Playing into the fierce wind and
driving rain in the first half IC found
it hard to establish themselves and
it was U C who made the early
running, playing the ball about with
some confidence and forcing several
brave saves from S H o l d e n .
However, Franz and the boys at the
back held firm and IC began to grow
in confidence. Inspired in midfield
by the return of Si Cole and by the
blistering pace of Mick Plummer
down the right flank (aided, to his
own surprise, by Ivan Parkin), IC
began to impose themselves and
took the lead on the half hour when
Nigel slid the ball home from a
narrow angle. The goal of the game
IC III—12
Goldsmiths II—2
In their final game of the season, IC
got off to a great start, when A d a m
Thomas made it TO after only 2
minutes. IC then started to play
some neat football but failed time
and gain to beat the offside trap. The
pressure continued and IC were
rewarded when Gary Mahoney
went through to score. Soon after
Wendal Charles scored with an
excellent 30 yard shot, and by half-
time IC were 4-1 up.
In the second half IC tore
G o l d s m i t h s apart w i t h some
devastating midfield play from
Christ Hargreaves, Toni De Leon
and Neil Bond who scored with a
brilliant solo r u n through the
defence.
A l t h o u g h hard pressed
Goldsmiths occasionally managed
to penetrate the IC half, but were
easily contained by IC defenders
Ivan Parkin, Sean Cary and Paul
Neville. Right full-back Mike Wilks
elected to play u p front for the
second half and managed to score
2 goals, coming close to a hat-trick,
as d i d Gary Mahoney. A d a m
Thomas went on to score 4 and
Teixeira got one after replacing Toni.
Goalkeeper Gary Hastings had an
excellent game—counting planes
landing at Heathrow.
came ten minutes before the break
when Nigel intercepted a clearance,
beat two defenders and dummied
the keeper to leave him on his arse
as Nigel gleefully slipped the ball
home.
With the wind behind them in the
second half, IC exerted almost total
domination but even with the
addition of Pip Peel, could not break
down the resolute U C defence until
20 minutes from the end when Nigel
fired in a low shot to complete his
hat-trick and put the result beyond
doubt. Despite effectively losing the
services of Phil Evans after a head-
butt from Pip Peel, Guy Hattersley
covered superbly at the back and
indeed IC nearly added a fourth
when Byron Wood's late effort was
ruled offside.
This w i n over the third placed
team leaves IC three points clear
with one game remaining and thus
guarantees them the
Championship.
