Reviews
get a dance with the girl of his
dreams by embalming his head in
toilet paper, Deruddere manages to
combine the humour and humanity
of the situation to an inspiring
degree before letting reality flood in
again as the girl leaves him after one
dance, and Vos realises that in order
to notch up this minor victory he
had to wrap himself u p i n
'shit-paper'.
In the final chapter, Vos has
degenerated into the mould of fully-
fledged adult. Devoid of any
commendable morals, he still seeks
his princess, unable to see h o w
bankrupt his soul has become
during the pursuit.
Throughout the film Duruddere
manages to-bring Bukowski's text to
life, injecting wit, pain, anguish and
an overall sense of the impossibility
of innocence.
The film examines and exposes as
false, the ideas we have about how
sex should be embarked upon and
also that classic of modern cinema
narrative 'The male friendship'.
Despite being involved in three
close mle friendships, Vos is rarely
comforted or helped by their
intervention. He is only made more
aware of his shortcomings.
Unfortunately, the advertisers
have sought to increase this
excellent film's success by
proclaiming that it is 'sexually
explicit' and 'strictly for adults only'.
The explicitness of the film is
emotional, not sexual, and the
capability to endure this is not
governed by age.

The Adventures
of Baron Munchausen
Baron Munchausen told stories. So
incredible were these stories that a
play was written about them.
Munchausen lived in the 18th
century and fought for Prussia
against the Ottoman Empire; for
Munchausen fighting the Turks
involved flying to the moon, talking
to the gods in Mount Etna and
surviving being swallowed by a
giant fish.
The film starts in a besieged town
ruled by an elected civil servant. In
the middle of the town is a theatre
where a performance of
Munchausen's stories is taking
place. The public love the play,
except for the one Baron
Munchausen. The Baron stops the
play a n d tells it h o w it i s .
Munchausen insists that he started
the war by enraging the Sultan and
that only he can stop it. In order to
beat the Turks, M u n c h a u s e n
escapes the town in a balloon made
of knickers and sets out to find his
old servants. The Baron has a
stowaway—the ten year o l d
daughter of the theatre boss.
Munchausen and the girl, Sally,
bring together a gang of four nearly
super-human men who are now all
old and weary. All is not lost though
and their adventures give the Baron
youth so he and sally can inspire the
little band of men. The Turks are
defeated and the town is saved.
Ex-Python, Terry Gilliam, directs
this lavish, comic and theatrical film.
The expense (£43 million) is always
evident in the sets, costumes and
effects. The style of the film is
reminiscent of the theatre where the
film starts. Similarities to both Brazil
and Time Bandits are clear; Gilliam
sees these two and Munchausen as
a trilogy. It is all good to look at,
especially Venus.
This film ponders a little on the
link between fantasy and reality,
being the story of an old man who
lives forever though his fantasies.
Essentially-it is a comic adventure
which, although not a laugh a
minute, is sometimes hilarious and
always sumptuous.

PREVIEW
The Dead
Pool
Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint
Eastwood) is back on the streets of
San Francisco, dispensing his usual
mix of justice and violence, as ever
on the edge of trouble with his
superiors and City Hall.
Harry is now a media celebrity
and if something should happen to
his well-being the ratings are liable
to soar. Bored movie director Peter
Swan (Liam Neeson of Prayer for the
Dying and Suspect fame) draws up
a list of the ten people least likelv to
survive the year, and Callahan is at
the bottom.
As you might guess, there follows
a series of violent murders as the
members of the list are eliminated
in sequence. Swan is prime suspect.
Harry sets out to find the real
culprit, but it is only a matter of
time, before he will become the
target.
'•The Dea4 Pool is the fifth of the
Dirty Harry films, and the first since
Sudden Impact five years ago. Once
again it is set and filmed entirely on
'location i n a n d a r o u n d S a n
Francisco.
After his political excusions to
. secure the local ice-cream parlour,
Clint Eastwood has returned to
make just what you'd expect. The
storv includes the cliched foil of the
nervous young partner and a
romantic interest in the form of T V
reporter Samantha Walker (for once
played bv Patricia Clarkson and not
Sondra Locke). A n d of course, there
is a large measure of death and
destruction.
The Dead Pool was received poorly
in A m e r i c a , but for a l l its
o v e r w o r k e d a n d stereotvped
substance it can still claim M r
Eastwood, and he remains one of
cinemas biggest crowd pullers.
Release date April 14.
