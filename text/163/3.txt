FELIX
Letter from
the Hebrides
I
t
sftgrand evening here in the Western
I
s
l
e
s
. Here I tun down on the seashore sit-
t
i
n
g o
u the oabor that Calum the polioe-
DID practices with. I was talking to Dun-
n
o MacPherson down at the jetty this
m
o
r
n
i
n
g mid iie was saying that it would
b
e line again tomorrow because the wind
y fallowed the BUU. Just a few minutes
i
g
o old Angus the* postman was saying
t
h
e opposite. Ho said it would be bad to-
n
o
r
r
o
w because the seagulls are aJl quiet.
W
e had n grand concert in the Village
H
a
l
t a few weeks ago. Pat the piper was
w
y good, he always is when he has a
W drums of whisky. Some young men
riAjriag at the Hotel sang a song called
"
I
n
m
o Real" or something like that. We
(
H
i
n
t
'
t understand some of the words, Dun-
n
o said they were French but it was very
(
o
o
d anyway.
T
h
e film-show at the Hall was called
"
B
e
n Her". We all thought it would be
i
b
o
u
t a mountain but it wasn't. It looked
l
i
k
e the charge of the light brigade at the
b
a
t
t
l
e of Hastings to me. Anyway before
i
t started the man from Kinloch who turns
(
h
e handle of the lantern said that we
v
o
u
l
d need to put a sheet at the side of
t
h
e screen because it was in cinemascope.
W
e t
o
o
k a sheet from the washing line
it t
h
e back of the Minister's house, it was
i bit wet but the picture soon dried it
H

Y
o
u
n
g Effie-Ann MacDonald has had
m
o
t
h
e
r wee bairn. Morag MacFaydon Bays
t
h
a
t it looks like its father Hugh Mac-
D
o
n
n
l
d but I don't think so. Hugh's hair
i
s r
e
d but the wee bairn has curly hair
l
i
k
e that young geologist chappie from Lon-
d
o
n
. Besides he used to go into the house
l
o
r tea every time that Hugh was away
it t
h
e fishing until last August which
»as w
h
a
n it would have happened.
O
l
d Ewan MacEwan came down to see
m
e last night. He wanted me to write a
l
e
t
t
e
r to the prime minister for him. He
m
i
d that he wanted Mr. Gladstone to comp
and look at his now brown calf since he
thought that ho should get more subsidy
on it than the inspector from the ministry
had given him, I told him that the prime
minister wouldn't want to como all the way
from London just to see his new brown
calf and anywav his name was MacMtllan
not Gladstone. Also he wanted me to put
in the letter to the prime minister that
he wanted n grant to put a now roof on
the bothy (that's like a woe stone hut)
at the bottom of his croft. Ho said that
it was a historical monument because hnn-
nio Prince Oharlev and Robert Bruce had
talked about the battle of Oleneoo there
Ho was quite sure this because ho had
found their initials carved on the door like
this PC-RB. Also he said that the din in
the windowsill was whore bonnie Princp
Chnrlev bad sharpened his sword and the
hook on the wall was where Marie Queen
o' Scots had hung her stavs. T have put
all this in the letter to the prime minister
but I don't think it will help. Neither
Robert Bruce, bonnie Prince Charley or
Mary Queen o' Scots were anywhere near
old Ewan's bothy.
There was a bit of a commotion over
on the wee isle of Eilean Maol last week.
They telephoned through to say that the
Frasers and the Campbells were figthing
with pitchforks and scythes. Duncan went
out in his boat with Calum the policeman
and Dugald Kennedy the jetty-master.
Calum came back with a black eye and
Duncan lost two teeth. Anyway they
brought back old Campbell and old man
Fraser with them. They had been fight-
ing about who should mend the fence be-
tween their crofts.
Apart from that its been very quiet in
these parts. Everybody has been putting
up their "Bed and Breakfast" signs just
lately ready for when the summer visitors
come. I must stop writing now the cows
are at the door waiting to be milked.
Hoots th'noo,

SPRING ON THE RIVER
I C W A stays clear
of mixed bar
The new mixed bar in Weeks Hall h^s
now completed its successful first month.
Although the regulars from Weeks and
Garden appear to drink moBt of the beer,
a sprinkling of females occasionally adorns
the bar lounge. Apart from the draught
Tankard, the main feature of note has
been the absence of ICWArians, so per-
haps those who cried so loud and long for
a mixed bar in the past, basing their ar-
guementB on the Declaration of Human
Rights, were wasting their time after all.
It is hoped that ICWA's absence will not
be permanent.
Should people like to see more of Crud's
drawings, they are on display in the bar
lounge, which will be open until the end
of term.

UNION
A* G* M.
The President's dream came true at last
on Fridav, May 19th when we had a quo-
rate Union Meeting. This was notable for
Jim Carter's long and hilarious minutes,
and for the resignation of the College Mas-
cot. This was not accepted by the house,
though the joke is Bomewhat worn by now,
and the static mascot collapsed at the news,
though rather belatedly. The non-static
static mascot took the rejection of his re-
signation rather badly, throwing one of his
shoes at the President: but his aim was
poor and he did not recover his shoe for
some time.
The election results are given elsewhere.
M'nes representatives on Council were
elected unopposed.
In the report of the Chairman of A.C.C.,
Paul Davies outlined our considerable sport-
ing achievements this year, and he was fol-
lowed by Dave Wilbraham and Bob Finch
with the R.C.C. and S.C.C. reports re-
spectively. Dave Wilbraham set a good ex-
ample by making his report last only six
minutes, and the reports were adopted.
As the hall was emptying rapidly by
then the President closed the meeting.
E L E C T I O N S
— Bed loose •
in the quad
Strange influences were at work in Beit-
Hall laet Thursday night iwhen a bed,
no doubt feeling rather lonely at having
to spend all its life alone in a hostel room,
got up and went for a walk. Having
walked across the Quad, it finally came
to rest in Room 61, New Hostel, after
an apparently vain attempt to reach the
Third Floor. This room was empty at the
time, the occupant, who shall be name-
less, not returnig until many hours later,
and so the thirig responsible decided to
occupy its time decorating the room.
Comments from the two, occupants
were, from Room 61, "That sure was the
most comfortable night I've had in this
country." And from Room 17 not a twit-
ter was heard.

Even the great have their troubles.
The eighteenth century essayist, Steele,
when editor of the 'Spectator', was driven
to plugging up one issue with some of
his own love-letters, which he passed off
as written by a gentleman of the Restor-
ation. The present Editor of J?elix has
no intention of following Steele's example
In this, however, Bhort of material he
may be. So that when Felix, two cent-
uries hence, is read with Design and
Which? is the intelligetsia's stamping
grounds, such as the National Film
Theatre, set in Eric Gill's Joanna, and
the Editor is beseiged with brilliant and
wittv contributions and not writing col-
nmn-bottom-stoppers like this one, no ir-
reverent college newspaper will be able
to poke fun at it on this score.

N O T E D . . .
Congratulations to Frank Irving for his
exquisitely worded notice displayed on
the Hostel's notice-board [in the Union
side-entrance, concerning the presence or
otherwise of Refectory crockery and cut-
lery in the hostel. The delicate phrasing
and perfect choice of words bear the stamp
of an accomplished man of letters, and
Felix has no hesitation in awarding Frank
the Award of the Year for Elegant Notice-
Writing.
AND IT SHOWS...
Nevertheless, it must be faced that
Imperial College, in one afternoon,
raised £ 200 more then the whole of
Saturday's fete, in spite of the Whitsun-
tide crowds.
Can this simply be .explained as the
difference between Clapham Common and
Princess (sic) Gardens?
