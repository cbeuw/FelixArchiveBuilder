CLUB
At last I.G. batsmen have been scoring
runB. The weather has been dry enough
to provide some hard, fast wickets, and
the First XI have scored in the region
of two hundred runs in two hours in their
last four games. The first four batsmen
have each scored fifty, the openers White
(75 n.o.) and Moore (62) taking the score
to 140 for no wicket against Q.M.C. on
Wednesday,, while Brough, the Captain
scored 114 n.o. in ninety minutes on
Saturday against South How.
The bowling has been considerably
strengthened by the acquisition of Flynn,
a very quick pace bowler who has
taken twenty-eight wickets already
this season. However, a good spin
bowler is still desperately required.
The team's performance so far is:
Won — 4
Brawn — 3
Lost — 1.
The Becond XI started the season with
on eight wicket victory over Institute of
Education but have suffered mixed for-
tunes since. They had two heavy defeats
whilst considerably weakened over Whit-
sun. However, back to full strength on
Saturday, they recorded a fine win over
R.S.M., T. Bland scoring 100 not out
and R. Williams taking 7 for 35. Their
performance to date is:
Won _ 3
Drawn — 1
Lost — 3.

JUDO
BOAT CLUB
U.L. FIRST T i l l BEATEN TWICE
A great deal has happened in the row-
ing world sinoe the last report of
I.O.B.C.'s activities appended in Felix.
The Head of the River race at the end
of Maroh gave a good indication of the
increase in the standard of the I.C. crews.
The first three eights rowed in the Read-
ing Head, all three moving up a [substan-
tial number of plaoes, and the First Eight
coming fourth, beating every other college
eight in the oountry as well as the Uni-
versity of London Purple boat. In the
Tideway Head, the Second Eight finished
27th several places higher than last year,
the First Eight came 10th, just failing to
best the University.
The regatta season started on the first
Saturday of term with the Third Eight
losing in the seoond round of the Mortlake
Maiden Regatta to a powerful Thames
crew. At Hammersmith Regatta both the
Third and Fourth Eights aquitted them-
selves well in the Maiden event, while
the second Eight won the Junior Cup con-
vincingly, beating University College
8chool, Vesta Rowing Club and Thame*
in oonsecutive raceB. They followed this
up with a good performance in Putney
Amateur Regatta in whioh they were very
unfortunate to lose to St. Paul's School,
the eventual winners, by a canvas in the
Junior-Seniar Eights.
I.C. T. R.M.A. Sandhurst.
This was hard tfought matich against
s very strong Sandhurst side which re-
sulted in another I.C. win, thus keeping
up our 100 percent record. In the first
contest Cohen fought the smsllest man
in the match, a five foot Malayan, man-
aging to avoid tripping up over him, and
the contest resulted in s draw. Robin
Bedding then set about his opponent with
great gusto, and with two strong attack-
ing movements quickly disposed of him.
A black mark was recorded against third
man Warne, who suffered one of his rare
defeats, but a few well-chosen words from
the Captain made (sure that the next
two men in the team,- Downing and
Simon, won their contests in convincing
style. The second black spot was recorded
whom Colin Barry was thrown by a bald-
ing gentleman wearing an orange belt.
A good laugh was had by all when Bowles
went out to meet his opponent; John is
only a mere six foot two inches and he
was dwarfed by (he gigantic Sandhurst
man, but the contest resulted in a draw.
The I.C. Captain, Ramsbottom, of neok
fame, then gave one of his usual brilliant
displays, beating the Sandhurst man in
about thirty seconds flat, and Shepherd,
our tame Black Belt, surprised himself
and the rest of the team by beating an
opponent only two grades lower than nim-
selves.
In the return match at I.C. we were
without Shepherd and Ramsbottom, the
latter, so he says, having turned over in
bed rather quickly and bent his neck in
tihe process, to consequence he has to
wear a large clerical collar. However, the
team again won quite convincingly. The
Captain did not know whether to be
pleased by the result or disappointed that
they could still win without him.
The Third and Fourth Eights met in
the semifinals of the Maiden Eights, the
former getting Jiome bv half-)a-length
after a great battle. The Third Eight lost
the final to Ibis by a canvas after another
neck-and-neck race.
The first three Eights were st Thames
Ditton Regatta on Wbit-Saturdav and once
ngoin did T.C. credit. The Third were un-
lucky to lose, once again in the final,
this time of the Junior Eights, to Quintin.
whilBt the First Eight lost the final of
the Thames Eights Cup to the London
Grand Eight by two feet. This crew had.
a few days earlier, beaten the Thames
Grand Eight bv the Same distances in
the Vesta DaBhos, a 500 yd. sprint held
st Putnev.
Chiswick Regatta last Saturday proved
to be a triumph for the First Eight. In
the Thames Cup Eights, in the Senior
event they beat Thames by one length in
the first round, and the University crew for
the second time and Quintin by a can-
vas and one-and-a-half lengths respect-
ively in the final. This is the first Senior
event the club had won for eight years,
and the prospeots certainly look bright
for the rest of the season.
Next weekend the U.L Regatta is be-
ing held, and I.C. is hoping to make s
clean sweep. In the following weeks, the
crews will be making their way up-river
via Walton, Reading and Marlow Reg-
attas to Henley, which is the first week
in July. The First Eight will be entering
the Ladies Plate and should acquit them-
selves well, and it is hoped to be able to
send the Second Eight to represent us
in the Thames Cup.

EDITORIAL AFTERTHOUGHT...
The success factor was 945 divided b
y
1500, the target, that is 63 percent f
o
r
the I.C. Carnival. The corresponding fig-
ure for the U.L.U. Carnival was 3
5
0
0
divided by 20,000, which gives 18 percent.
There is a difference you know.
