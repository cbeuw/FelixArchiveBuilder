NEW SPANNER FOR GUILDS INTERNATIONAL
STUDENTS CLUB
Union Meeting held on R.C.S. roof.'
AT I.C.
On Thursday May 25th a Guilds Union
Meeting was hold on the roof of the R.C.S.
Chemistry Building. Tt was thought that
this unusual location would give rise
t
o s
o
m
e sport with the inmates, but they
wro all hard at work and did not notice
t
h
e two hundred or so Ouildsmen walking
through the building.
The meeting was opened with due cer-
e
m
o
n
y : Norman Greaves declared the
meeting open, the house roared the trad-
itional response "Late!" and the Vice-
president hoisted an article of ladies*
underwear to the top of the flagpole to
appreciative applause.
Assisted by the President and en-
c
o
u
r
a
g
e
d bv the house the Secretary de-
ciphered the minutes written in the
Pnder-seprettirv's illegible scrawl, gave up
hnlf-wav. and they were passed as rend.

h

With moving eloquence the President
recounted 'lie adventures of the old wood-
e
n Spanner and bade it farewell, and then
t
h
e n
e
w Spanner was introduced to the
Union, This is of metal, cast and engraved
w
i
t
h the name of the College, and
weighing between 20 and 200 lbs. ; the
e
x
a
c
t figure cannot be disclosed. Tt is an
e
x
a
c
t replica of the wooden Spanner which
w
a
s used as a pattern, and considerably
leu portable, indeed the President could
hardly lift it. T
t was baptised with a bottle
of Final Selection, and strong men were
seen to weep as the beer dripped to the
ground.
The now Spanner was put to good use
right away, n swoop being held to guess
St* nMtnet weight in pennies, and this
raised £3.15.0 for OXFAM. The weighing
desitrnod and built by the College and
was done on a special portable balance
consisting mainly .of a plank and a bottle.
The President attempted to explain the
scientific principles behind this instru-
ment, but thp house remained invincibly
ignorant of these, despite his visual aids
in the form of band-waving, etc.
The President closed the meeting with
the traditional Boomolaeka. and in at-
tempting to wave ttie new Spanner as he
had been wont to wave the old one, he
nfearly "overbalanced backwards off thej
roof. The Vice-president then pnoposed
John White as Guardian of the Spanner,
as he seemed to be the only man capable
of carrying it. To this the President in-
sisted that he .had already closed the
meeting, in spite of attempts to convince
him that he had only adjourned it, so
that this had to be held over until Tues-
day's meeting.
On the way out, the Guildsmen were
pleasantly surprised to find some mem-
bers of the R.C.S. Executive holding the
door open for them, assisted by a Black
Belt Judo, a very courteous gesture which
was much appreciated.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The R.C.S. annual general meeting was
h
e
l
d on Thursday May 18th. The Presid-
e
n
t
, Alan Logan, opened the meeting and
a
e
k
e
d the secretary to read the minutes.
This the secretary refused to do and tend-
e
r
e
d his resignation, which was accepted
w
i
t
h acclamation by the house. Reading
t
h
e minutes was pointless anyway as type-
written copies of them were provided for
ali present, who showed their contempt
for such trivialities by making them into
p
a
p
e
r darts and bombarding the officers
w
i
t
h them throughout the elections.
The Entertainment Committee were el-
e
c
t
e
d by ballot papers, but the election of
y
e
a
r reps, and one or two other officers
w
a
s on more unusual, though doubtless de-
mocratic lines. During the Trophy Officers'
elections one candidate was asked, if he had
just had four pints set up for him and
Theta was removed, what course would he
follow? With true scientific insight into the
problem, he said that in view of the potent-
ial energy contained in the four pints, he
w
o
u
l
d consider it his duty to drink them
b
e
f
o
r
e pursuing the abducted mascot. He
was elected. It was announced that Pete
Young had been elected Vice-president by
a small majority in the previous day's bal-
lot, and that votes had actually been re-
ceived from Silwood. The passing round of
the beer in loving-cups at this point caused
some disturbance during the presentation
of reports, thoBe at the back of the theatre
being uncertain of the quantity of beer
available and the cubic capacity of those
nearer the front. Our reporter, though a
Guildsman, showed _Jris impartiality by
drinking the health of the R.C.S. Union
with the rest.
The President's Report contained an in-
teresting passage about the formation of
i European Cultural Community . He had
received a long-distance telephone call from
Paris on this subject, R.C.S. having been
recommended by the British Embassy there
as a college suitable to form part of this
Community. No doubt feeling that further
explanation was unnoegsary the President
did not elaborate on this, but reveali 1
that he and some of his officers had at-
tended a week's conference in Paris, on
which he could not report as the minutes
of their sessions were not yet available.
The house showed its scepticism of this
explanation by screaming "Lies!" and fir-
ing a further salvo of paper darts in his
direction.
At the of his report, Alan Logan handed
over the coat of office to the new Presid-
ent Finlay, D. MacPherson, who had been
elected unopposed. Having dealt swiftly
with Any Other Business, Finlay con-
ducted the closing Kangella during which
Theta fell apart. The newly-elected
Trophy Officers were blamed for this
mishap, and narrowly escaped losing
their trousers.

Many of you reading this article will
have been to foreign countries and received
in some form or other the regal hospitality
usually accorded to British people, partic-
ularly from student to student. In Stock-
holm especially, all foreign students are
made very welcome at a club which
has now been running for 5 to 10 years
for the purpose of providing a social atmos-
phere in which students who are working in
or visiting the city are able to meet
talk, argue, and in fact do all (yes, A L L )
that students enjoy doing to the full. This
is run by students, for students, and is*
entirely self-supporting.
This summer we are holding a similar
club for all visiting foreign students, dur-
ing the month of July. The programme will
consist of a, dance every Saturday (to be
held in the Concert Hall) and a social even-
ing (to take place in the Snack Bar) at
which talks or films of topical interest
will be provided for everyone's entertain-
ment. The start of this whole scheme will
bo on Saturday evening, July 1st at 7 p.m
when we will hold a reception to which
several notable people are to be invited,
and the first dance of the club will be
held afterwards.
In order that this whole scheme shall
be a success as we intend, help is needed
in one or all of three categories. First,
in the planning of the programme, final-
ising arrangements and advertising through-
out the University and abroad as well,
before Julv 1st. Second, in running the club
during July. Third, in attending the club,
using the facilities and acting as hosts to
our visitors. Everyone who is in or around
London is welcome.
We are also going to rim a few tours
or visits for our foreign friends during
the week and at the weekend. Ideas in
hand at present are a coach tour around
London with a guide, visits to Chiswick
Works of London Transport, the Royal
Mews at Buckingham Palace and the Cer-
emony of The Keys at the Tower of London.
Can you think of any other places of in-
terest to visitors? Call in at Room 17 (Old
Hostel'. Coffee will be provided in return
for useful suggestions.
To a Briton, our Capital City can be
extremely lonely place; even more so to
a foreigner on his or her first visit to this
country. Every day half a dozen foreign
students call at the U.L. Union in the
summer vacations wanting to meet British
students, and to find out what we do and
how we live. That is why this scheme is
so deserving of your support. It should
have- been done years ago.
This year, the scheme is experimental
lasting only for the period of one month
and if it succeeds, a much bigger scheme
will be possible (and required) next year.
An example of this is the Stockholm club
which "Snowballed" solely because it was
a success and people who had been there
advertised it to their friends. So if you
cannot help this year, at least tell your
friends (both at home and abroad) ; there
will be a far greater need in 1962. We have
some duplicated circulars if you wiBh to
send some abroad it saves you writing!
There is a notice in the union Entrance
Hall; please read it (if you have not al-
ready done so) and attach your name if
you can support. If you have any queries,
questions or want any further information
contact Peter Hills (3C) at Selkirk Hall.
50, Holland Park (PAR 7041), or Brian
Manton (3C) at Room 17, Old Hostel
(KEN 5111, ext. 445).
