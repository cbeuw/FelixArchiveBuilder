FELIX
Editorial comment
Because of tin* dearth of student activity
that prevails at this time of the year this
will be the last) Felix this session. As usual,
Felix wishes till its readers the very bent
of luck in thoir examinations; with you.
we hope that there will be sufficient quest-
ions on the half of the syllabus 'hat vmi
revised to ensure that the authorities will
allow you to return in October. However,
if all the energy that was not expanded
on writing articles for your newspaper is
divprted into revision, you should all get
Firsts. We hope to see all of you back in
October, tltough previous experience in-
dicates that this will not be fulfilled.
The Editor would like to thank all those
people who have helped him this term;
those students who in response to appeals
and threats have produced contributions,

THE PSEUDO-
INTELLECT
It never ceases to amaze me that I.C
can turn out such a large number of rav-
ing morons. Heading the list of this re-
markable crew are the pseudo-intellect-
uals.
Let me draw you a little pen portrait
of one of them. He stands, or perhapt-
droops is a better word, about five feet
six inches tall. His face is not very pre-
possessing, being white and pasty, and
sometimes spottry as well. He is thiin
and for some reason* unknown to me al-
ways looks as though the next force two
breeze {will blow him over. He weflrs
strange clothing, sandals, jeans, sweaters,
(usually with a C.N.D. badge pinned on)
iong hair and an expression of intense
thought.
What does he like? He likes Brubeck,
Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Picasso.
Ionesco, PirandjeUo, coffee houses and
coffee. (But he cannot stand Brahms
Bach, Beethoven, El Greco, Shaw. Shake-
speare, pubs or beer.) He likes going to
parties and drinking foul, cheap Algerian
wine (possibly as a gesture of solidarity
with the forward-looking, counter—react-
ionaries with whom that unhappy country
is-pestered). He will always give you his
opinion (always a very low one) of our
country s leaders.
In fine, he likes everything new and
dislikes everything old. His reasons,
should you be so misguided to ask for
them, will be long, sonorous and mostly
nonsensical. The truth of the matter is
that he likes everything new because it
is new, and dislikes everything old be-
cause it is old. He knows not, neither does
he understand.
One other thing of note. He hates any-
one who plays Rugby and drinks beer.
The possibility of a beer-drinking Rugby
player having an original thought, or even
being able to think, does not exist for
him. "Mens sana in sano corpore." is
to him a diabolical attempt to keep the
masses in subjecting. (Or rather it would
be, if he believed in a Devil.)
This then, is our man, the new man
of twentieth century England. This is
the descendant of those great Englishmen
of old. I'm sure you will all agree that in
this context descent is the right word.
It is written in the Bible, a book of
which he has never heard, that '''The
3ins of the fathers shall be visited on the
children to the third and fourth generat-
ions." I think that some of our fathers
must have committed some real whoppers.

Dear Sir,
Following the general discussions and art-
icles on nuclear disarmament with mild
interest, I am slowly coming to the con
elusion that Mr. Peter Young, amongst
others is getting slightly confused with his
t.wn ideas. In one article (FELIX, Friday
May 19th, under Letter to the Editor) he
says, about British nuclear weapons,
"...our bombB can make little difference
to the situation..." and "...the renouncing
of nuclear weapons by one of the three
nuclear powers; Russia and the U.S. will
not do it..." The inference is obvious. I
am sure that Mr. Young would be more
convincing in his arguements if he omit-
ted contradictory statements from his art-
icles. All the same, nuclear disarmament
would not solve any problems, for cosider
the consequences. Does Mr Young want
this country deprived of all forms of milit-
ary retaliation in the event of serious ag-
gression? Can he really imagine this coun-
try tucking in its tail and running to the
U.S. for protection? No!!! If t;e is half a
man he will admit he cannot, and if he
had any pride in himself and his country
he would not write "...our bombs can make
little difference." Someone else said some-
thing very similar once, and he was ver*'
wrong. Did^, not a handful of our men ta"
on, fight, and utterly defeat that invincible
power, the all-conquering masters of the
sky, the German Luftwaffe. Does that not
aptly illustrate that a small power, with
limited resources, but with infinite guts and
determination can be victorious against
heavy odds? Perhaps it would be a different
situation in a nuclear war, but it is still,
always has been, and always will be, better
to die fighting, knowing that you have at
least wounded your opponent, than to die
running away to hide "behind Mummy's
skirts" so to speak: for die we must in the
event of nuclear war. Because if this it
is necessary that Britain keepb iier nuc^ar
arms. As for keeping a minimum num-
ber of convencional forces, what does that
achieve? Nothing. It would simply be a
half-hearted attempt at showing some lim-
ited force of arms, which would gain ab-
solutely and precisely nothing.- The whole
idea is ludicrous. The' only alternatives
to nuclear arms for this country are not
conventional forces, but a force of highly
skilled saboteurs. Their operational power
was aptly demonstrated during the last
war.
Until that is reaslised I suggest that the
C.N.D. packs its bags and retires grace-
fully, for the only thing they are doing at
the moment is providing an excuse for
semi-hysterical half-wits 'to go traipsing
about the countryside at Easter, making
a nuisance of themselves to others more
civilised human beings.
Yours sincerelv,

The Editor would like to point out that
the Peter Young referred to in this letter
is not the Pete Young who is Business
Manager of this newspaper and Vice-pre-
airW-eler^. nf R OS.
Dear Sir,
In replying to Mr. Young's "impulsive
reaction" to Mr. Finch's article in
Scrutiny", I make no apology for put-
ting what I hope is a less spontaneous,
more, careful thought-out point of view.
Unilateralism is a very important issue,
meriting considerably more than the
blind, hysterical "Ban the Bomb" attit-
ude which so many Unclear Disarmers
seem to have.
My own view is that nuclear weapons
are an appalling horror, and that the use
of them against Japan was one of the
worst atrocities of the last war. However,
it is foolish to shut out eyes to the fact
that they do exist, the knowledge is there,
and one country after another is going
to make them, and possibly use them.
It is quite possible that if Portugal were
a nuclear power, she would use the Bomb
in Angola.
Bearing t'.iese circumstances in mind,
it is hard to see what good could be ach-
ieved if Britain threw away her nuclear
weapons. In the first place we would have
to leave NATO, for the Western defence
syatom, like the Eastern, is inevitably
founded on the possible use of nuclear
weapons. There may be a case for relying
on American weapons rather than mak-
ing our own. but this has been Liberal
and Labour policy for years and is not
a unilateralist point of view. How can
Mr. Young reconcile his plea for unilateral
disarmament with his own fatuous state-
ment that "if we must have nuclear pro-
tection we can have America's"?
Having left NATO, we would become
a neutralist country like India and Sweden.
But this is entirely incompatible with our
present position as a world power of con-
siderable prestige and influence, with still
remaining responsibilities for large areas
of the world. Britain is at the moment
in a position to encourage world peace.
The only ultimate solution for the nuclear
problem is World Government, and I hope
this country will be able to make a lead
in furthering this aim.
Would Unilateral Disarmament have
the slightest effect in inducing other nu-
lear powers to follow our example? I do
not believe this is any more possible than
it was possible for the widespread pac-
ifism in Britain in the thirties to quell
the rising militarism of Germany, or for
the present abstinence from nuclear
weapon testing by the three major powers
to impose a similar abstinence on France.
Eventually we would be left in a ridicul-
ous position as the only country without
nuclear weapons, and would be under
the heel of whatever country chose to im-
pose her will on us. t
No, Mr Young, the C.N.D.'s "bold, im-
aginative plan" is nothing but a recipe
for the biggest national— and possibly
international — disaster this country has
ever known.
Yours sincerely,
I.N. Guy
ATTACK ON THE
TWO-WHEELERS
The Oonin Bill at present in the pro-
COSH of going through Parliament, will if
brought tntn force virtually kill motor-
cycling as we know j*7 by making thin
form of transport probitively expensive.
Thin Bill, the Motor Vehicles (Pasflengcr
Insurance) Bill, nooks to make p
a
H
H
e
n
g
c
r
itiKtirancc compulsory for all vehicles. Let
UH examine the implications of this Thf.
insurance companies, who are opposed to
this measure, estimate that this will in-
crease premiums by £ 1 5 to £20, HO Unit
instead of the five pounds or so which
the rider pays at present for third party,
fire and theft cover, he will have to p
a
y
twenty-five pounds. Inevitably, this will
prevent the large majority of those w
h
o
ride motor-cycles and scooters from con-
tinuing to do so, as one of the great ad-
vantages of the two wheeler at present is
its cheapness and low running costs.
The incredible thing about this is that
at present, passengers can insure them-
Helves at premium of about thirty shill-
ings per thuosand pounds compensation.
No cnae can l

comparable to that for
pjirf.v insur-
ance. The "third party" is tue innocent
victim of an accident that he could d

nothing to .prevent, but the passenger

perfectly free to refuse the lift, or to in-
sure himself against accident, so w

y

this very heavy finacial burden on the
rider?
The Ooverment has ',an open mind"
towards this Bill, but because there h
a
s
been so much opposition to it they have
introduced a clause allowing solo riders
who undertake not to carry passengers to
be excluded. However, fair this appears
at first, it is merely a sop, and a rather
deceitful one at that, for if the Bill i
a
passed we can be certain that this clause
will <
b
e repealed very soon. A similar
clause in the 1930 Road Traffic Act en-
abled solo riders undertaking not to carry
passengers to obtain third party cover at
reduced rates, but was repealed in 1934,
because riedrs so covered did have ac-
cidents while carrying passengers ilegally
and their policies were of course invalid.
This Bill is both unnecessary and dis-
criminatory. It will affect the motor-
cyclist and the scooter rider unfairly b
y
imposing a penalty on him which h
e is
the least able to bear. Students who ride
two-wheelers for pleasure, convenience o
r
economic reasons are adviced most strong-
ly to write to their Members of Parliament
telling them that they are opposed to the
Cronin Bill instructing them to prevent
its passage through the House, or at least,
tu quote one reply received to such a let-
ter by a student of this College, "not to
let it pass, on the nod, as it were."
WHY?
Why is it that the normally articulate
person when faced! with the prospect o
f
making a telephone call makes a complete
mess of it? It is difficult enough to g
e
t
through ; the arguements with the operator,
the pressing of Button B in order to get
back into the right sequence of events,
the eventual connection, the frantic bel-
lowing "hello" on both sides (the p
o
o
r
fellow must be deaf) until you remember
you haven't pressed Button A. The call
is important, asking the girl for a second
date, you had worked out what you w
e
r
e
going to say, it sounds fine, only you don't
say it. Instead you make some inane a
n
d
damning remark such as "Are you doing
anything this week?" If she wasn't s
h
e
is now.
The instruments make no allowances f
o
r
captivating smiles and flashing teeth, it
even twists vour voice round and minces
it before delivering it at the other end in
a minced-up condition. Surely closed- cir-
cuit television is the answer to the probl-
em ; one would be able to see the effect
of one's remarks and would prevent one-
self from ploughing deeper into the mire,
It would be all visual, thus doing a
w
a
y
with the magnificent sound effects the tele-
phone is blessed with at present: the var-
ious "tones". Their efficiency cannot b
e
denied, they baffle completely. You're
never quite sure whether the girl is in, en-
gaged, or just playing hard to getl
If we are to live in an age free from
frustration, fear and worry, then society
will have to find a better instrument for
communication than the telephone, the
woman's friend and the devil's disciple,
the fruit machine with no prizes, the gad-
get that musses up so many romances; but
whv?
