PROFILE
THE EDITOR
Paul Ekpenyong Riz Shakir Richard Waring
Michael John L l e w e l l y n Williams was born and e d u c a t e d . He
came to IC in 1971 to study Chemistry and having passed h i s
first year, was promoted to Dep. Rep. S u c c e s s at this brought him
to the elevated heights of floor rep. to ICU C o u n c i l . He participated
fully in C o u n c i l affairs and made his presence felt, raising the
status of the floor rep from i t s previously inoperative depths.
However, parallel to his more serious pursuits, he was the E d i t o r
of the R a g Mag — notable for its infamous " d e a d baby j o k e s " .
Progressing " n a t u r a l l y " from being the Chairman of the
Working Party considering the future of F E L I X , he subsequently
became its E d i t o r . A job to which he devoted a l l his energies
and has followed with a single-mindedness which has lead to the
rediscovery of s k i l l s lost during the letterpress era. The dedication
with which he has tackled the minumerable problems w h i c h faced
him a t the outset resulted i n his being awarded a thoroughly
deserved U G A.
H'is year in office has, however, not been without controversy,
for while his reviews have caused no comment, the introduction
of the page three photograph has drawn the comment; "He is a
male chauvinst s"t." A t times, he has voiced doubts about the
job and on a S T O I C interview s a i d , "You have to be a dildo to
do this job". H e can only but be praised for his attempts t o
integrate F E L I X into the IC s o c i a l life; the F E L I X A N N U A L
M O T O R R A L L Y and the F E L I X P H O T O G R A P H I C C O M P E T I T I O N
being prime examples of t h i s .
On getting to know him w e l l one soon realises h i s true
character. Behind h i s durable authoritative exterior lurks a
nostalgic sentimentalist. Whilst producing the 25th Anniversary
Issue his desire to bring back the past and put F E L I X above
everything else manifested itself g r e a t l y . T o be fair one must
quote him, "Not all of us are in it for the ego-trip",
Mike tends to be a bit of a lone wolf but after knowing him for
a while his i n i t i a l l y reserved attitude changes to one of a good
friend. H e is a keen sportsman, rifle and pistol shooting being
his forte for which he has won various medals.
Mike w i l l now be directing his abundant talents to research
into the properties of polymers. H e w i l l no doubt be prominent
in the Union and w i l l express his views on the various topics of
the d a y . It only remains for the Editor-elect to gather up the
pieces of the F E L I X staff and fill in the necessary gaps to
proceed on another year's publication o f this outstanding
newspaper. V i v a W i l l i a m s !
