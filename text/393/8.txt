8 FELIX
T H E E P I L O G U E
(Continued from page 7)
suddenly a l l of C o u n c i l was buzzing
about it . When the time came for the
d e c i s i o n to be taken, the majority of the
Executive were quite rightly undecided:
They had not sufficient informal ion upon
which to base a decision .The. recommend-
ation to re-allocate the F E L I X sabbatical
to the as yet uncreated post of F i n a n c e /
Buildings Officer was rejected in favour
of a move to create a non-sabbatical
Junior Treasurer and a working party to
investigate, gather the facts and make
recommendations on the workings of the
F E L I X o f f i c e a n d t h e c e n t r a l
administration. U is gratifying to state
now that the working party report which
i s to be presented to J o i n t C o u n c i l next
Monday has independently confirmed
practically everything that I said and
argued at the time when the topic was
first broached.
The situation with regard the F E L I X
sabbatical was potentially dangerous: a
re-allocation would have far-reaching
£ disastrous consequences in my view.
The complex arguments involved made
the whole thing very vulnerable to
misconception. A working party was
e s s e n t i a l for a meaningful outcome.
"Complexity breeds vulnerability" is an
axiom which I coined last summer. Whilst
some w i l l always d i s b e l i e v i n g l y sneer at
it, I nevertheless fee! that it is applicable
to a wide variety of situations . How many
of us were vulnerable to the misconceptions
created on either side due to the
complexity of the arguments used during
the recent Referendum campaigns?
The second term saw the brunt of the
N F v . The Left saga, much of which was
approximately tiresome . P e r s o n a l l y I was
unable to endorse the attitude of either
side, my main concern at the time being
in terms of what the overseas students
at IC felt about the s i t u a t i o n . Many of
them seemed quite unperturbed. I found
the N F ' s racist attitude unpleasant and
the Left's tactics s i l l y . I should have
thought that the Left would have realised
by now that to try and muzzle another
group's view w i l l only increase that
group's morale which is the last thing that
the Left w a n t . B e s i d e s the concept of
"freedom of s p e e c h " is a sensitive one to
toy w i t h . John Stuart M i l l , a 19th Century
philosopher, once wrote: "We can never
be sure that the opinion we are endeavour-
ing to stifle is a false opinion; and if we
were sure, stifling it would be an evil
still..." A n d more recently, a computing
P G s a i d : "The Left say 'We must stamp
out Fascism'. But that's about as fascist
as you can get!"
March saw the first F E L I X Annual
Motor R a l l y . The three C C U ' s fielded a
total of seven teams (poor show R C S ! ) .
Apart from disrupting a service at St
P a u l ' s and brushing with the P o l i c e at
Trafalgar Square, a l l went fairly smoothly.
Ironically enough, if looks could k i l l then
the eventual winners of the R a l l y Pot
would have been responsible for my demise
several times over!
Next came the E a s t e r vacation. The
NUS Student Journalist conference was
interesting and propounded certain ideas
about the National Press s a y i n g that many
national newspapers deliberately gave
student a c t i v i s t s distorted coverage just
because they tended to be left-wing. Lies,
I thought, sheer fabrication. T h e n came
along the NUS National Conference at
Llandudno where I compared what I had
seen and heard with what the National
Press had to say the following day.
Needless to say, my attitude to those
particular reports went something l i k e :
"Lies. All lies." C l e a r l y my hitherto
moderate credentials were slightly
nudged to the left.
The vac a l s o saw the second V a c a t i o n
F E L I X produced under my E d i t o r s h i p (the
first was F E L L X N o . 361, a twelve-page
issue produced during the summer last
year). The feedback I have received has
formed the basis for the belief that the
concept of V a c a t i o n F E L I C E S presents a
very real opportunity for the Union to
involve its postgraduate membership. The
status of the P G not only academically
but within the framework of the U n i o n
a l s o is currently a sensitive i s s u e . Who
indeed can best represent the interests of
PG's ? The IC PGG or ICU? The sooner
this question is faced up to and resolved,
the better .
The third and final term menacingly
poked its cranium over the gloomy horizon
bringing with it the r e a l i s a t i o n that most
of the F E L I X Staff would be zapped to
smithereans by impending e x a m s . I
imagined myself attempting to write the
whole newspaper myself and doing the
collating on Thursday night a l l on my
todd. (gob, s o b ) . That left me feeling
semi-uncomfortable-It was something that
I had anticipated last term and so I came
up with the idea of producing two four-
page issues per week. E a c h edition would
require just folding with no collating . The
practical side of this innovation worked
fine, but my enthusiasm for the size (four
pages as opposed to the usual twelve)
left me slightly j a d e d . The last straw
came when someone told me that there
just was no longer enough in the Friday
FELIX to get them through their first
morning lecture. My dutiful conscience
could take no more, so weekly eight-
page issues returned to finally eclipse
the s e s s i o n . Nevertheless, the point has
been now unquestionably proven that two
F E L I C E S per week can be done . It w i l l
be up to future Sabbatical editors to decide
whether such an idea be further exploited.
The result of my final project is what
you are looking at now: a multicolour
F E L I X . I expect this idea to become an
annual event. The very real problem
however with colour work is that it takes
much longer to dry (as opposed to using
black ink) thus paste-ups have to be
produced well in advance. A s far as I'm
concerned, the novelty of multicolour work
was just gasping to be tried out, so there.
I would like briefly to turn my attention
to one or two aspects of the Union. I have
been seriously concerned that too many
good p o l i t i c a l ideas have been thrown out
of Union meetings simply because the
proposers of these ideas have had
negligible grounding in t h e a r t of
communicating complex arguments to a
s c e p t i c a l audience. The concept of
presentation comes up once a g a i n . Few
people recognise its potential.
In one respect NUS is divorced from
the grass root students: many of the
s p e e c h e s made at the L l a n d u d n o
conference were theatrical performances
of preaching to the converted which would
have been laughed out of the Great H a l l
here at I C . P o l i t i c a l awareness has a
very low coefficient within this Union,
but to make anyheadway the powers that
be must crawl before they can w a l k . This
is a point which I believe the current
leadership has missed. (Over to you, Mr
Teague). T h i s now raises the subject of
perspective since we are constantly being
exhorted to consider the wider species of
this almost metaphysical a n i m a l . I think
it is true to say that to maintain a narrow
perspective on a controversial issue be it
abortion, c a p i t a l punishment, women's
lib, the education cuts whatever, is to be
a reactionary of the first order. Thus the
progressive trend is to try" and grasp the
wider perspective. But consider a l s o that
wider a perspective becomes (eg looking
at a national conflict in the context of
the current international situation), the
more difficult, in general, it becomes to
v i s u a l i s e (and hence the more difficult
for someone to convince others of its
validity); and once that happens, one's
p o l i t i c a l education becomes susceptible
to unscrupulour d i s t o r t i o n . It is the
" o o m p l e x i t y breeds v u l n e r a b i l i t y "
argument a l l over a g a i n . But I do not w i s h
to d w e l l on this for too much longer.
It is often said that "facts speak for
themselves". T o that kind of naivety I
would add "occasionally". F a c t s can
e a s i l y be lost by a mumbling speaker and
exaggerated by an eloquent orator (after,
shrewd s e l e c t i o n , naturally). The recent
Referendum campaigns have clearly shown
us that distortion, whether by exaggeration,
omission or skilfull appropriation of
emphasis is part of politicans' lives and
anyone aspiring to such status would be
hypocrite to deny this. Y e s , it would be
true to say that I am a p e s s i m i s t i c c y n i c .
It r e f l e c t s t h e e x t e n t o f my
disillusionment.
T h i s Epilogue wculd not be complete
without a few words about the I C U P r e s -
ident. Trevor P h i l l i p s has been a
formidable adversary this year, often
proving himself the master of procedure
and debating strategy . He has o c c a s i o n a l l y
publicly appeared to be very cool w h i l s t
private reports have indicated that his
anger over a particular issue raised by
F E L I X has been i n t e n s e . He has worked
extremely hard, consistently and determin-
edly; his near-infinite capacity for being
shrewd has held him in good stead in his
negotiations at College l e v e l .
Trevor was concerned at the beginning
of the s e s s i o n that any kind of defence or
favourable connection with F E L I X might
be construed by his " o p p o n e n t s " as ref-
lecting our then close friendship — such
was his anticipation of possible friction
within the Executive . Happily, such a
situation was peremptorily precluded fol-
lowing certain personal events which
appear unlikely ever to be resolved fully.
Trevor has not had an easy year. After
much vehement letter-writing to F E L I X in
past years on the "Crisis of leaders hip"
within the Union, he took office having
stormed home in the elections with a
massive 919 votes, only to find the UGMs
as badly attended as before, rarely (if
ever) broaching the 200 mark; NUS Demo
contingents never exceeded 70. H i s
broadly-based ' a c t i v e ' support had sudd-
enly become ' p a s s i v e ' , almost tacit: an
embarassing situation to be in.
I s h a l l always remember Trevor P h i l -
lips for his ambivalence (a vestige of
things to come?) Whilst on the one hand
he has been a major inspiration as re-
gards my own personal p o l i t i c a l education
and the persuance of thoroughness and
diplomacy, he nevertheless, from my point
of view, cast an uncomfortable shadow on
F E L I X . I was extremely unhappy with the
attitude which he adopted over the quest-
ion of F E L I X ' s s a b b a t i c a l . I can now
reveal that I have read the confidential
d i s c u s s i o n paper which Trevor presented
to the E x e c u t i v e prior to the C o u n c i l mee-
ting when the decision regarding the
F E L I X sabbatical was t a k e n . Some of
the assertions which he made left me in a
state of supreme and total anger. Never
before had I been forced to question his
integrity. I hope that I shall never have
to do so a g a i n . I am s t i l l curious as to
why Trevor awarded me a U G A , because
he and I have often begged to differ on
irreconcilable grounds, sometimes in the
most vehement terms. Thus my initial
reaction to receiving this s l a p on the back
was to reject it. But such a gesture, even
a refusal to wear the tie, would only have
been considered as irrational tokenism.
Suffice it is to say that I remain unhappy
about the award and curious about the
criteria which were used for awarding it.
