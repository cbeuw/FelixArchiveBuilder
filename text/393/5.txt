T O S U M U P , in so few words, the many
achievements of s o many people would be
impossible and any attempt infinitely
boring to the majority of F E L I X readers.
A year of involvement with IC Union has
convinced me that student power at I C
van be defined as one of two things; either
the output and annoyance value of a stereo
system or the a b i l i t y of elbow and forearm
to perform c y c l i c operations for periods
normally ranging between 1 and 24 h o u r s .
So disappointed was I at one stage,
with the level of student participation
that I, self styled opponent of P h i l l i p s i a n
left w i n g subversion, found myself
proposing such unsporting ploys as
"executive walkouts" and "withdrawal
of facilities". However, my daytrip to the
Left E n d soon ended on r e a l i s i n g that the
Union a l l o c a t i o n of funds was on a per
capita b a s i s . It occured to me, in a
balance restoring f l a s h , that the fewer
people making use of the U n i o n ' s resources
and services the more that remained for
those who enjoyed participating. A s I was
amongst this number, it therefore seemed
intelligent to ignore the whole i s s u e . My
normal imbalance having been therefore
restored, I tried to come to terms with
student apathy with respect to IC Union
and never quite s u c c e e d e d .
Of course it is not so difficult in M i n e s ,
where an average of about 50% under-
graduate participation can be achieved,
and it is in this spirit that our strength
in Mines l i e s .
Despite a few set backs during the
year, notably the removal of our Davy by
G u i l d s , a charitable opposition would
not deny the quality performance of our
small section of the c o l l e g e . The success
is attributable to the Mines Spirit (mostly
alcohol), i t s ' members and the organisers
of the years s o c i a l and rag c o l l e c t i n g
a c t i v i t i e s . E v e n taking account of
inflation, our contribution of £2350 to
rag gives some indication of the very
hard work put in by Pat Gorman and the
S o c i a l Reps .
The relationship of Great B r i t a i n to
the Common Market is paralleled by the
Constituent College/Imperial College
relationships. In the search for unity and
efficiency the constituent organisation
combine, exchanging services and sharing
f a c i l i t i e s . A s a natural consequence
some right to self determination is
sacrificed and this has been accepted.
I suspect, however, that to many, the
value of their group identity within the
system is of utmost importance. Is it
impossible to be pro B r i t a i n and pro
Europe? Is it possible to be pro C C U and
pro Imperial College? Put like t h i s , the
answer is simple. C l e a r l y , there need be
no conflict. In my opinion conflict arises
when the tesue of identity is forgotten.
In Mines we are proud of our C o l l e g e ,
as indeed are members of lesser institu-
tions proud of their own, and rightly s o .
The reason conflict arises lies in the
failure of Imperial College U n i o n to
recognise and u t l i l i s e the identity of the
C C U ' s to the community advantage.
Rather, they choose to ignore it, creating
a fourth unit rather than a combination of
three.
The strength of Imperial College is the :
pride that we have in our i n s t i t u t i o n s .
The reason Imperial C o l l e g e ' s reputation
is high is because of the reputation it has
in the field of mineral and metal production,
of engineering and of s c i e n c e . Imperial
College is nothing if not a combination
of these.
The C C U system has been attacked
before and w i l l , no doubt, be attacked
again. I believe it is the right and proper
way to make use of the spirit w h i c h e x i s t s
in the constituent C o l l e g e s . T o do so,
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e U n i o n should be
structured as a pyramid. Put simply for
mathamaticians and s c i e n t i s t s : -
3 x C C U S I C U
N B : Depending on complexion of power,
I C U may be placed on the left of the
e q u a l i t y . However, this may produre an
inequality,
I C U <• 3 x C C U .
It was for this reason that I opposed
the I C U E x e c u t i v e position for the P o s t
Graduate Affairs Officer. Over the years,
I C U posts have become entirely indepen-
dent of C C U ' s and this makes I C U a
weak and ineffective machine. Our strength
is through the C C U ' s . I hope that next
year the situation may improve and that
the recent s o c i a l s u c c e s s e s may continue.
In this I w i s h you a l l the very best of
l u c k .

DRAMSOC

IT HAS been a very s u c c e s s f u l season for IC Dramsoc. We
began the year with a tour of As You Like It to schools in the
south of England (see F E L I X No. 363); we a l s o performed to
public audiences at Lymington and Winchester.
The new s e s s i o n saw an influx of keen new members (not a l l
of them freshers) and this was
perhaps the main cause of our

FOLK CLUB
Anon
T H E 1974-75 s e s s i o n has been a full and varied program at
, the c l u b , from the extreme traditionalism of Martin Carthy — who
pulled a vast audience on the opening night of the year — to the
dedicated lunacy of Fred Wedlock — who a l s o managed to f i l l the
Union Lower refectory with an e n t h u s i a s t i c audience. There have
memorable
been many other
evenings with such people as
Magic Lantern { and ' their
Shadow Puppets), Gary and
Vera Aspey and Trotto to
mention a few.
A s a change to the regular
club there have been three
c e i l i d h s during the year, a l l
w e l l Jttended. The last of these,
earlier this term, started with
a Morris display by Albion
Morris Men, in the Union quad
and then moved up to the
conceit hall for more Morris
dancing, parlour ballads from
Mr Gladstone's Bag and a
couple of hours, during which
assorted combinations of
'Swinging partners' 'Promen-
ading', 'left and right hand
stars' etc were to confuse a l l
those who ventured onto the
floor.
The c l u b sees a lot of people
coming in from other c o l l e g e s
a l l over London, something
like 25% of our members are
from c o l l e g e s other than IC.
There has been a steady flow
of v i s i t i n g floor-singers, on
occasions from places outside
of London.
We are a l l set to continue
the past s u c c e s s of the club In
the autumn term. The first day
of next term sees Mike Harding
who c l a i m s that he was too
poor to be born and had to be
knitted by the WVS. There Is a
full programme of guest artists
at the regular Wednesday
evening c l u b , except Rag-week
when there w i l l be a R a g -
C e i l i d h .
We are a l s o arranging a folk
concert, featuring Frog Morton
— an increasingly popular
electric folk band — plus
support. D e t a i l s about this and
a l l other events w i l l be
