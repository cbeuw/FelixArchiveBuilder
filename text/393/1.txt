IT'S BEEN A
BITCH OF A YEAR !
THE ACADEMIC session 1974-75 will surely go down
in the annals of IC Union's history as one renowned for its
spasmodic outbreaks of "bitching" ie criticism verging (on
occasion) towards hostility.
T h i s does not mean to
suggest that a l l the hostile
c r i t i c i s m s which have appeared
have been ill-founded. Indeed
hidden amongst much of the
r h e t o r i c c a n be f o u n d
fundamental debating points
which reflect a genuine concern
with regard to a particular
topic .
The issue to be raised i s
this: Recognising firstly the
bad feeling which "bitching"
will inevitably create and
secondly the fact that in the
majority of instances, in the
past year the controversy was
settled amicably, then is it
always necessary to raise the
dispute in public?
There is evidence to support
the view that it i s the " p u b l i c "
aspect of the dispute coupled
with the hostile terms i n
which a n otherwise " f a i r "
comment i s sometimes couched
which i s capable of doing the
most damage.
During the pas t year the
F E U X Letters Column h a s
been the scene of c r i t i c i s m s
both c o n s t r u c t i v e a n d
destructive, mild and vehement.
Whilst undoubtedly the Column
has been l i v e l y a n d enter-
taining, the question has tobe
asked "A t what cost?"
B y a l l means let us have
controversies, but next year at
least, may the almost Satanic
rite of " b i t c h i n g " c e a s e .
Here endeth the lesson
from the gospel according to
St. FELIX.
S T O I C D O E S I T A G A I N !
STOIC, IC's own student television service, has managed to scoop
the national media yet again by an exclusive interview with B A R R Y
HUMPHRIES, the creator a n d co-star of the latest Barry Mckenzie
film "Barry McKenzie Holds His O w n " . Mr Humphries arrived at the
STOIC studio yesterday in drag and created pandemonium. The
interview is to be broadcast next Tuesday in the J C R , Southside and
Union. Watch out for posters .
WHAT A SCORCHER!
A T L A S T , it has happened. After much wheeling and dealing
it was finally announced last Monday that the final plans,
incorporating the original suggestions which had been agreed
upon, are to be fully implemented " i n the very near future".
T h i s announcement, made
by the Editor of F E U X , Mike
W i l l i a m s , comes a s a great
shock to many senior Union
officials who were last night
expressing "grave concern"
about the p o s s i b l e effects
this unexpected move might
have on the future of F E L T X
and indeed the Union i t s e l f .
Speaking on behalf of the
U n i o n , Trevor P h i l l i p s the
I C U President s a i d , "I have no
doubt that it is Mike Williams'
intention to create within the
broadly-based framework which
has been built up around
FELIX this year a more
fundamental style of approach
to solving the more
troublesome aspects of the
newspaper which have been
difficult to overcome in light
of inflation and the Government
cuts in educational
expendure."
