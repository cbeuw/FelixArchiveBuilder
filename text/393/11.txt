Rugby Review
IC H A V E had only a moderately s u c c e s s f u l season this year.
The l s t X V won more games than they lost, but only just, and the
best way to sum up the year would be " i n c o n s i s t e n t " . The team
frequently showed promise, but suffered far too often from
cancellations w h i c h disrupted team c o n t i n u i t y . A s a result,
from: tennis, horse-riding,
crazy gold, table-tennis, volley-
ball and snorkelling — many
included in the price . A

CROSS-COUNTRY REVIEW

In a n attempt to increase the
standard of the c l u b , we w i l l
be running a n Extras X V on
Wednesday as w e l l as Saturday
next season. T h i s should
provide greater competition for
l s t team p l a c e s , and provide
Extras witha greater opportunity
to develop a good team spirit
and raise their standard to that
of a real reserve X V .
The Extras and the " A ' s "
both had good seasons, each
losing only two gamas. However,
both teams suffered from lack
of support due to the fact that
many good Constituent College
players did not turn out for I C
on Saturday. Nevertheless,
those that d i d play were
eventually moulded into a
happy side both on and off the
f i e l d , and it is only a pity that
more people i n a college of
some 4,000 students do not
play rugby for IC on Saturday.
Although this season has
been far from satisfactory i n
many respects, I am confident
that next season could be a
really s u c c e s s f u l one for the
whole c l u b , and, for the sake
of the many dedicated people
who put i n a lot of work, both
on and off the f i e l d . For the
good of the c l u b , I hope I am
proved right.
