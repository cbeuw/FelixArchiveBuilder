MIKE WILLIAMS PROUDLY PRESENTS:-
THE EPILOGUE
OR: Reflections on the past year
The past year for F E L I X has been one of inexorable change . A new method of printing
has been adopted and the a s s o c i a t e d hassle to e s t a b l i s h the new pattern of production
was anticipated, encountered and finally conquered i n the difficult and protracted birth
of what i s , i n essence, a new kind of F E L I X . But the newness does not stop at the
physical appearance of the newspaper. My major criteria for the future development of
FELIX are rooted in the past, hound in black buckram and are currently sitting on one
of the shelves in my office quietly representing twenty-five years of student life at IC,
warts and all. Insofar as an innovation (as opposed to a gimmick) i s a vestige of progress,
then it follows that F E L I X has made giant strides since 1949 hence true to tradition I
have been at pains to encourage innovations this year such a s the V a c a t i o n Issues, the
Careers Supplement, the Motor R a l l y , the Photographic Competition e t c s o that F E L I X
not only looks new but is new. But to begin at the beginning.

I S U P P O S E some people spend the
weekend before their exams d o i n g r e v i s i o n
but for a few of us this i s impossible
because the annual Manchester to B l a c k -
pool Veteran and Vintage R a l l y falls on
the first Sunday of June; B o ' always
insists on going and has to be accompanied
(he i s not yet old enough to be trusted
alone).
T h i s year we were given the daunting
task of attempting to retain 80% of the
available trophies . O n arrival at the start,
so much time was put into the p o l i s h i n g ,
in a n attempt to retain the Concourse
Trophy, that we forgot to read the
regulations a n d this resulted i n our
receiving three time faults: one for being
a minute early at the first time control,
the second for not being the same amount
early at the second, and the third for
being a minute early (again) at the end.
Confused? So were w e .
A t the P o l i c e H Q a t Hutton a l l the
vehicles were put through a driving test,
Which a s far as B o ' was concerned was
test of his rather minimal lock, since i n
order to get round the tight corners i n
time, even at the hands of the intrepid
R a i n e , a certain amount of rear-end slide
and opposite lock was in evidence. E v e n
so we were s t i l l 313 seconds over time
which placed us about 10th out of the
175 or s o entries.
Although the rules suggested that
veterans should be loaded onto trailers
at Hutton, we decided that it would be
quicker to drive B o ' the remaining twenty
miles to B l a c k p o o l v i a the vintage route,
rather than have to load up and then
observe the 40mph trailer towing limit.
Some of the marshalls took quite a lot of
persuading that although we were still
driving, we were no longer competing.
Most of this part of the journey was spent
waving at spectators who seemed to have
taken the opportunity of the fine weather
to come out in force. Next year, a n
automatic waving arm w i l l have to be
installed, a s i n Her Majesty's v e h i c l e s .
After a n excellent buffet luncheon on
the telegraph at the Norbreck C a s t l e
Hotel i n B l a c k p o o l , we were expected
to take part i n a n exceptionally s i l l y
procession w h i c h involved attempting to
make a couple of hundred elderly v e h i c l e s
travel a couple of miles at less than a
w a l k i n g pace. Suprising though it may
seem, the older the v e h i c l e , the more
difficult this i s ; B o ' was the second most
senior entry and he registered his objection
by sooting his plugs but at least he d i d
not totally loose his cool (a phenomenon
to be noted amongst some of his juniors
like the 1913 A l l d a y s & Onions which
was boiling vigorously).
We returned to the hotel at a suitably
plug-cleaning spped to arrive first i n a
thoroughly unofficial race back for the
evening gathering a n d our cutomary
trophy c o l l e c t i o n .
A n hour later, and for the next five,
the D o l l y Sprint tender c a r with B o ' i n
close pursuit (what's that damned veteran
car doing on my tail? I'm doing 60!) was
to be seen heading down the M6/MI with
"/ spy with my little eye" being played
into the early hours of the morning and
getting increasingly devious, (we had to
keep awake — honest!)
The triumphant team with i t s two
trophies, (only two??) arrived at B o ' s
garage at 1.30 am and without further
ado went to bed (not i n the garage s i l l y .
What exam at 9.30?).
Thanks to Tony Raine (tender behind)
and R i c h Gundersen (Navigator — "Where
and w e ? " and mostly B o ' (What 30 limit?)
for a great weekend.
August l s t last year s a w a n enthus-
iastic Chemistry graduate taking the
helm, confident of being at least able to
stay afloat after being thrown i n at the
deep e n d . It d i d take me a while to
determine that the previous year's
regime had inadvertantly encased my feet
in concrete (and to my misfortune, not the
high alumino-stlicate kind). / swammeth
not. I didst flounder immeasurably and
found it grotesquely unfunny.
The offset-litho a n d its retinue of
associated machinery had a n almost
infinite absorption coefficient i n respect
of the weirdest spectrum of unwelcome
gremlins imagineable. In hindsight, I
realise it would have been a hedge
against inflation h a d I invested in a
firm which manufactures a s p i r i n s . B y
the time the s e s s i o n was about to begin,
with the production of the Diary having
practically done me to death, I w a s
prepared to jack it i n , throw i n the towel,
resign, k i c k the Union up the bum and
laugh a l l the way back to the polymer
labs. Sadly, some heroic demon caught
me unawares. / was going to see it through
come hell or high water.
The first term as i n any kind of self-
perpetuating, connected series had its
unusual even extreme b e g i n n i n g s . T h e
F r e s h e r s ' Issue w a s a total pain i n the
naus. Imagine the scene at midnight the
Friday before the beginning of t e r m . T h e
litho-operator is hanging around waiting
to run the last plate w h i c h happens to be
the cover. T h e front page i s a headline,
one story ("Refectory Prices Up 17 Per
Cent")and the rest b l a n k . I am frantically
varityping another story ("Copulation: a
Union Discipline Offence?"). I'ts done,
titled i s letrasetted, i t ' s a l l pasted-up
and i t ' s 2 am. There's s t i l l a nice b i g
space i n the middle to f i l l . T h e litho-
operator i s getting impatient. Suddenly a
flash of gross inspiration: "How about
space-filling with FELIX WELCOMES
FRESHERS'?" P a u s e . Sound effects
denotes severe h o n k i n g . But there's no
other c h o i c e . So it goes i n .
Elsewhere, egoes were strutting
(especially when drunk), grand postures
were being s t r u c k a n d haughty affectations
of status glibly glided from bubble to
bubble. T h i s was I C at its most entertain-
i n g . The competitive spirit was fresh and
aggressive a n d morale w a s h i g h . N e w
ground w a s effortlessly being covered
daily. A n d there w a s the E d i t o r , h i s
concrete socks only just beginning to
chip away, down at the deep e n d .
Say aloud i n an a c c u s i n g voice: "Why
is FELIX such an insignificant size?
Why are the photos so crummy? What do
you mean, there's been machine trouble?
What are the so-called production
difficulties? Why the hell haven't you
printed our sports reports? What does
'opportunist' mean? Just what do you do
with your sabbatical time, eh? What do
you mean you haven't got time to produce
and distribute those UGM posters? The
Union Publicity had better be done by
tomorrow — or else!" A g g r e s s i o n was i n
the ascendant .Delete ' letterpress'; insert
' o f f s e t - l i t h o ' ; now consider the
ramifications of producing a publication
yourself on the p r e m i s e s . Don't think too
hard, your brain w i l l get zapped through
severe overwork. I am unable to avoid
being angered by the concept of intolerance
on such a wide s c a l e .
The first term s a w F E L I X celebrate
its Silver Anniversary . B a r r i n g the banana
fritter (titter titter) the commemorative
dinner was a great s u c c e s s with seventy
people attending, eight of w h i c h were
past E d i t o r s .
The 25th Anniversary issue w a s a n
ambitious project w h i c h only just made i t ,
but it nevertheless paid off handsomely .
The intention was to make it a c o l l e c t o r ' s
item with the s i l v e r banner and trimmings,
twenty pages, gold heavyweight cover and
with plates containing photographs being
made professionally i n Chancery L a n e .
The fact that every one of the approx-
imately 2,800 copies produced disappeared
in record time i s some measure of
achievement.
The second term started off innocuously
enough with the hassle of producing a
Careers Supplement. T h i s w a s only a
moderate s u c c e s s i n terms of advertising
revenue but the feedback on the idea has
been very encouraging. Two other notable
things happened during J a n u a r y .
F i r s t l y , after the U n i o n finally s a w
sense and relieved me of my duties as
P u b l i c i t y Officer, the subject was raised
at the following C o u n c i l . T h i s provoked
a subsequent d i s c u s s i o n where a l l and
sundry eagerly expressed their discontent
with my handling of the Union publicity.
But more importantly it highlighted
certain prejudices and areas of total
ignorance which 1 immediately became
determined to overcome.
B y now my concrete socks were
showing signs of cracking .Sooner or later
I would be able to hold my own i n the
d e e p e n d . It w a s bound to h a p p e n
eventually, but would it happen in time?
Secondly, the controversial topic of
the T h i r d Sabbatical w a s ominously
r a i s e d . The I C U President understandably
tried to underplay the idea ofre-allocating
the F E L I X S a b b a t i c a l by briefly
introducing the topic a s a kind of post-
script to the President's b u s i n e s s . Indeed
his words at the time were: " . . . a n d
C o u n c i l may have to take a d e c i s i o n on
this matter." (My emphasis i n i t a l i c ) . T h e
effect of that announcement was e l e c t r i c ;
