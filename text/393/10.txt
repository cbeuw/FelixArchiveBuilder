the same again next year.
A l o n g s i d e the news programme, S T O I C
has provided light e n t e r t a i n m e n t ,
d i s c u s s i o n and interview programmes.
It Is the interviews of recent months that
viewers may remember. These started in
December 1974 when Lord George-Brown
v i s i t e d the C o l l e g e to give a General
Studies l e c t u r e . T h e interview which took
place after the lecture has made a very
interesting a n d welcome addition to
S T O I C ' S a r c h i v e s .
Before we s a y more about other guests
to S T O I C , w e must mention the unique
s i t u a t i o n in which w e now find o u r s e l v e s .
We mean of course the regular spot w h i c h
we now have on the C h a n n e l 7 network.
T h i s Educational C a b l e T e l e v i s i o n
system, which broadcasts over most of
London, i s run by the Inner London
Educationa I Authority and c a n be received
by 93 institutions, not counting I L E A
s c h o o l s . S T O I C i s the first student
t e l e v i s i o n service t o be given a c c e s s to
the C h a n n e l . T h e interviews shown s o
far have been with Lord George-Brown,
Professor L a i t h w a i t e , Professor Swanson
and Mel B r o o k s .
Readers of F E L I X w i l l know that the
Met ( B l a z i n g Saddles) Brooks interview
took place during the E a s t e r v a c a t i o n ,
when S T O I C managed t o scoop B B C
T e l e v i s i o n a n d R a d i o . We must thank
F O X - R A N K films for being s o helpful
with the early arrangements for the
programme.
A t the end of A p r i l we interviewed the
Director, and scriptwriter of the F O X -
R a n k f i l m , 'Paper Tiger'! T h i s programme
included film c l i p s , a s d i d the one w i t h
Mel B r o o k s .
Our most recent venture i s with E M I
films and Barry Humphries, of 'Aunt Edna'
fame . H i s new film 'Barry McKenzle Hold
His Own' is due for release s o o n . T h i s is
the first time that w e have had a guest in
drag, in the studio; the Interview w i l l be
broadcast over the I L E A T e l e v i s i o n
Network during October.
Interest in S T O I C i s not only growing
w i t h i n the C o l l e g e , ' the B B C are a l s o
interested in the interviews that w e are
arranging. L B C (London B r o a d c a s t i n g ) a r e
a l s o taking the opportunity t o come t o
certain recordings a n d interview our
guests.
We feel this past year h a s been our
most s u c c e s s f u l and w e look forward to
the 1975-1976 s e s s i o n when w e hope to
receive further support from students at
Imperial C o l l e g e .
