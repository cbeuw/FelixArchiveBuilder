F i n a l l y , a few miscellaneous comments.
It has been for me a great priviledge to be
the E d i t o r of F E L I X . I nevertheless look
forward to p a s s i n g on this burden. During
the first term I got through 100 tablets of
' H e d e x ' . It was no joke when I fell a s -
leep one night trying to solve a lay-out
problem: I woke up the following morning
still thinking about i t . The worst part of
the E d i t o r ' s job occurs when he has to
find enough enthusiasm to write up a very
trivial story. T h i s year has been intens-
ely interesting and extremely challenging,
but I cannot, in the true sense of the word,
say that I have enjoyed this year. Indeed,
a sabbatical year is not there to been-
joyed; it is a year of hard work and
rightly so.
I am not a male chauvinist pig: I just
cannot stand those i n s i p i d females who
believe that they are God's gift to IC;
they do no good to the cause of women's
equality whatsoever. One big regret that
I have had over the past year has been my
dismal and unforgivable failure to recog-
nise the potential of sports articles as
possible front-page leads. I believe that
F E L I X is in a good position to encourage
spectator attendances at important
matches. Unfortunately, I have only just
come to that c o n c l u s i o n ; there is s t i l l
next year though.
After nearly 4000 words, I think I had
better s t o p . Take care and remember:

A R E S I D E N T of Garden H a l l is gravely
i l l in h o s p i t a l today following a 60ft f a l l
form his window on Tuesday night.
B r i a n Metcalf was standing on his
balcony as a friend went to the door.
When the friend returned he had fallen.
When he was reached he was concious
with his head resting on some plastic
guttering w h i c h he had brought down with
him.
A n ambulance was immediately c a l l e d .
F i v e minutes later three fire engines
turned up. The ambulance appeared about
ten minutes after t h i s . It took a further
half an hour to remove him so as not to
exacerbate his injuries in any w a y .
The police were a l s o at the scene
and it was they who measured the height
of his f a l l , as w e l l as bringing down some
plastic guttering he is believed to have
struck some wire netting.
On a r r i v a l at St. Mary's H o s p i t a l
Paddington B r i a n was placed in the
intensive care unit where his condition
was said to be c r i t i c a l . H i s injuries
include a d i s l o c a t e d p e l v i s , a broken
thigh, several broken ribs, a collapsed
lung, and internal bleeding. The latest
bulletin indicates the location of the
internal bleeding has not been found and
is s t i l l s e r i o u s l y i l l .
B r i a n is a first year P h y s i c i s t and had
already completed his e x a m s . He had
b e e n u n d e r t o t a l a n a e s t h e t i c
at the dentist on Monday and had drunk
four pints on Tuesday e v e n i n g . It is
thought that this resulted in a d i z z y s p e l l
or temporary blackout which caused him
to fall.

T H E F E L I X E d i t o r i a l of 30th May,
whilst questioning my "quasi-martyrdom"
in not awarding myself a Union General
Award on somewhat spurious grounds,
does however raise the question of
whether our ways of recognising particular
service to, contributions to the a c t i v i t i e s
of the Union are adequate. Had the E d i t o r
of F E L I X deigned to attend the A G M at
which I awarded him a U G A he might have
had more constructive comments to make.
(Some of us have to work almost single
handedly on a Thursday in order to
produce a Friday FELIX - Ed.)
1 would contend that the award system,
for ICU certainly, and possibly the
C C U ' s , is inadequate. There is no
accepted policy on the award of ICU
S o c i a l Colours or U G A s , except the
C o u n c i l minute that lays down the
composition of the Colours Committee,
and says that C o u n c i l may award s o c i a l
colours after the S o c i a l Colours Committee
has made its list of recommendations.
The manner in which selection is made
is governed by convention only; and those
conventions have changed with virtually
every year.
For instance in the case of S o c i a l
C o l o u r s , this year we conducted a secret
ballot amongst the members of the
Committee, after having had an explanation
of the merits of each person nominated.
T h i s ensured that the list was much more
selective than hitherto, and, I would
argue, more meaningful. There was a
larger number of nominations than last
year.
In the case of U G A ' s , the conventions
have changed much more rapidly, from a
point where the President awarded them,
after consultation with the Hon Sec and
D P , to the present situation where the
President has absolute discretion and
gives awards to whom he likes, and for
what reasons he alone sees fit. U G A ' s
are effectively a President's A w a r d .
There is no question of his " a c c e p t i n g "
or " r e j e c t i n g " one, as implied by F E L I X .
It has tieen argued that he should receive
one ex-officio, to save him the embarrass-
ment of awarding himself one. T h i s Is
absurd. How can anyone receive an award,
presumably for outstanding service in his
office, simply by virtue of having held
that office? By definition most Presidents,
say* wi II be mediocre, not outstanding.
Worse yet, can one award oneself " t h e
supreme a c c o l a d e " ? Of course not; this
would be behaviour reminiscent of the
most pompous and self-important tinpot
banana-state rulers. It is behaviour that
I would not w i s h to emulate.
However, the worst aspect of it a l l is
that U G A s are awarded on the d e c i s i o n
one person only, and the one person with
probably the most biased opinions on the
U n i o n ' s priorities. In my case I gave
U G A ' s to people who really could not be
denied them by any reckoning. They were
a l s o personal tributes to people for whose
work I have a great deal of admiration, in
different w a y s .
However is it acceptable that the
U n i o n ' s premier award should be made in
such a way?. I think not. E v e n the C o l l e t p
only award F e l l o w s h i p s through the
Governing Body — on recommendation of
the F e l l o w s h i p s Committee.
The question must be asked as to why
I did not end the system myself. The
answer is simply that the reorganisation
of awards has not been my major priority
this year; whether we give U G A s or not is
unlikely to change the price of cheese.
However, I do think that changes should
be made. P e r s o n a l l y , I would prefer to see
C o u n c i l or UGMs awarding Honorary Life
Membership, and I am taking steps to
introduce this.
F i n a l l y , it must not be assumed that
I oppose awards in principle. I do not. I
do believe that people deserving of them
should have the satisfaction of knowing
that the widest possible cross-section of
Union members recognised the value of
their contribution. For me, at least, that
is the pleasure to be gained out of any
kind of award. I believe that the people
gaining U G A ' s and S o c i a l Colours this
year can rest assured that they do have
that recognition, and steps w i l l be taken
to formalise that s i t u a t i o n .

WITH R E G A R D to awards, can anyone
think of a s o c i a l l y acceptable substitute
for a tie, for women to wear/use?

I A P O L O G I S E if hackles were raised
at IF by my letter to F E L I X last week.
C r i t i c i s m was not directed at the Institute
generally nor particularly at the author of
"IF Only" but at a particularly fallacious
view held by many people, about student
a c t i v i s t s . It Is a view that must be nai led.
It may not have been directed at me
personally. However, unless students can
view their leaders/servants with c o n -
fidence, not c y n i c i s m , the potential of
the potential of student unions, and
indeed, the movement itself is immensely
reduced.
