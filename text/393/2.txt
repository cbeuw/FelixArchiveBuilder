S p e c i a l thanks must go to Jen Hardy-Smith lor her u n f a i l i n g moral
support when it w a s most needed; Sue, A l i c e and D o l for ensuring
that F E L I X did not fall apart at the seams by managing to wake me up
each morning w i t h the best cuppa in S o u t h s i d e ; G i l l M c C o n w a y , our
v a r i t y p i s t , whose work has gone from strength to strength and whose
newly acquired pasting-up s k i l l s has aided me immensely; Ian Morse,
our litho-ope: a tor, for h i s unflagging committment to printing F E L I X
and h i s tenacity i n ensuring tha t F E L I X c omes out on t ime; P a u l
E k p e n y o n g , R i z Shakir and R i c h a r d Waring, without whom F E L I X
would not have e x i s t e d this year; and finally to the F E L I X Staff in
general (both student and permanent} who have suffered my arrogance,
e x c e s s e s , id i os y nc ra c le s and morbid sense of humour with the
minimum of d i s s e n t .
It has been a good year.

What a scorcher!

Waring, the News E d i t o r . R i z
Shakir, the Features Editor and
next year's Deputy President,
was even vehement: " / think
it's silly." P a u l Ekpenyong,
the Sub-Editor and Editor-
elect of F E L I X , summed it a l l
up s u c c i n c t l y . " / think it
ref heels a certain amount of
desperation on the Editor's
part when, in an attempt to
cheer up those people who
have had a near-fatal dose of
exams, he feels he has to
write a meaningless front-page
•space-filler with a title more
suited to a national news paper
during a hoi summer when there
is nothing else to make the
headlines.''

A S Y O U w i l l probably have already noticed, each member of
the IF Union E x e c u t i v e is taking it in turn to write an article for
F E L I X , s o I suppose I should first introduce myself: I am the
Social Sec for IF (Social Sec, some of you might say who as yet,
does not seem to have organised any s o c i a l events). Although I
have only had this post of
Social S e c . for a few weeks I
have discovered that organising
social events for the summer
term is not exactly e a s y .
Amazing though it may
sound, I am in the process of
"The Taming of the Shrew".
Originally this was to be at the
Open A i r Theatre (Regent's
Park for those of you«who are
so ignorant) but I have just had
a letter from the company
saying that due to the bad
spring weather the building of
the new auditorium complex at
the Open A i r Theatre has been
delayed. S o , to avoid d i s -
a p p o i n t i n g y o u a l l the production
of "The Taming of the Shrew"
is having a s p e c i a l season at
the Round House, C h a l k F a r m .
T i c k e t s for the evening
performance on June 30th are
s t i l l a v a i l a b l e , s o anyone
wanting tickets please come to
the IF Union any week-day
between 1 pm — 1.30 pm a n d
hopefully someone should be
there.
Social events for the rest
of the term (what there is left
of it) seem to be almost non-
existent, but next term's events
are bound to be s u c c e s s f u l and
well supported. ( L e t ' s hope s o
anyway).
LETTERS
The Referendum
Imperial College,
1st June, 1975.
">ear Sir,
Unfortunately when this
otter appears the referendum
v i l l have come and gone but
nevertheless 1 feel I must
omment on Mr P h i l l i p s ' fervour
in urging us to vote which
ippeared in F E L I X 392. H i s
a s s u r a n c e that "It is a
historical decision", paral leled
by C a p i t a l R a d i o ' s "This is
the most important decision of
your life" and HM Government's
It is possibly the most
important choice that the
British people have ever been
asked to make" is misplaced
enthusiasm . In fact the choice
we have is between industrial,
corporate c a p i t a l i s m ; and
anything further is purely
i l l u s o r y .
However it is salutary to
see Trotskyists. supporting
national sovereignty and rather
unusing to see fellow cabinet
ministers at one another's
ihroats but that is where my
interest ends .
Econometrics is a young and
highly imprecise s c i e n c e . It is
certainly not possible to s a y
whether leaving the E E C w i l l
aid our economic development
or not, nor whether the E E C
has cushioned or exacerbated
our national c r i s i s i n the past
two years. In any case our
major raw materials, e s p e c i a l l y
o i l , are not under European
control s o we s t i l l pay d i s -
proportionate prices on the
world market.
1 would contend that the
referendum is largely irrelevant.
Indeed Mr P h i l l i p s analogy
with the European c u p final
was peculiarly opposite — one
side may have the superior
arguments, the other side may
win but the b a l l has no real
say i n the matter; it just gets
kicked around.
Power of the people!

IF Only Again
L'lnstitut Francais,
2 nd June 1975
Dear Sir,
I feel I must reply to the
letters headed " I F Only
C r i t i c i s m " i n last fortnight's
F E L I X .
F i r s t l y to s e t Mr P h i l l i p s '
hunted mind at rest. He has
hitherto been nothing more than
a name on paper, to me. There-
fore I cannot see how he can
accuse me of directing a n
attack at him p e r s o n a l l y .
However, the I F Union would
be delighted to make h i s
acquaintance and lend him a
sincerely friendly ear any time
he cares to vis it u s .
Secondly the letter from I F
ex-President Katie Makinnon:
at the risk of sounding petty
myself, I c a n only s a y her
c r i t i c i s m strikes a rather
shallow note. If she is s o
concerned about the organisation
of next year's R a g a c t i v i t i e s ,
I suggest she consults the R a g
Co-ordinator who w i l l no doubt
set her inquiring mind at rest.
Yours faithfully,
Lorna Thomas
Rag Rep, IF
