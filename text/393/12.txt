12 f t l l X
RUGBY TOUR
C A S T Y O U R mind back to the final day of last term when
twenty ex-rugby players joined the new elite C o l l e g e society,
Mafiasoc. T h i s happy family set off to B r u s s e l s for five days of
drinking, honking, drinking and chundering, with the odd game of
rugby which had unfortunately been arranged before h a n d .
A r r i v a l at Ostende was
uneventful except for three
people being s i c k opposite the
duty free bar and one person
who s h a l l remain nameless
climbing over the passport
control barrier s i n c e he d i d
not want a nasty blue stamp
on his brand new passport. At
last our feet had hit B e l g i a n
s o i l a n d t h e r e w a s a n
uncontrollable urge to embrace
a n d w e l c o m e t h e l o c a l
peasantry. Whereupon our
heroic nameless person rushed
onto the B r u s s e l s train and hit
the first person he could see
for s i t t i n g i n our s e a t s . In no
time at a l l we piled out of the
train at B r u s s e l s Midi only to
find we should get off at
B r u s s e l s N o r d . In the ensuing
panic to reboard the train, D.
Hart thought of a novel way of
helping by collapsing in the
doorway.
A r r i v i n g at the correct
station at last, half the party
managed to obtain taxis to
take them to what appeared an
old converted fortress, Hotel
L i t o . The other half of the
party decided to walk as the
hotel was only around the corner
A t l a s t b l i s s f u l sleep
decended and there was time to
lay b a c k and take a count of
the day's proceedings. It was
decided that Big Lipscombe
was in the lead with 5 chund-
ers and one unconfirmed.
The next day saw our
herioc band heavily defeated
on the fie Id of combat by B r i t i s h
B r u s s e l s R F C . The least said
about this game the better but
mention should be made of M.
Cotter, known to his friend as
the H o g , and A . Williams for
his fine t r y . Sorrows were
q u i c k l y drowned with bottles
of S t e l l a and the B e l g i a n
populace subjected themselves
to stout renderings of N e l l i e
H a w k i n s .
The evening after match
celebrations were virtually
e x c e s s i v e with many people
only just managing to stagger
the fifty yards from cafe
R o y a l to the hotel. A t 1.00 pm
the hotel doors were locked
and barred but S. C h u d y ,
suffering from a fit of c l a u s -
trophobia, left v i a the window
and the a i d of a drainpipe.
Unfortunately when twelve feet
from the ground on his return
entrance a s p e c i a l angled
section of the drainpipe allowed
Chudy to return q u i c k l y to
ground l e v e l by coming away
in his hands. The resulting
dive into the concrete pavement
was given nine out of ten marks
for stupidity.
The next day, Sunday, was
deemed a day of rest and by
mid-day appetities were running
high due to the fact that there
was virtually no restaurant
open by the hotel. A n unsus-
pecting tour member who
ventured into the room of
Lipscombe was immediately
told to get out and only return
if he was between two s l i c e s
of bread. Soon strength was
back to normal and meetings
were held in various cafes in
the B r u s s e l s centre to elect a
leader and boss of Mafiasoc,
Mr B i g .
The first candidate was
U . G . L y b o o t h whose every
command was to be obeyed
e x p l i c i t l y . He was soon
sacked as Mr B i g for walking
more than one hundred yards
to the next cafe. Lipscombe
(hen stepped forward to accept
the title of B i g and with the
aid of a chronic attempt at a n
Italian accent deputised M .
Sergot as his L u i g i . T o cries
of "Wheresa ma sphaghetti"
the cafe crawl commenced with
the rule that when B i g drinks
everybody d r i n k s . Cement boots
were prepared forpeople failing
to obey L u i g i or B i g and S .
Booth, known to his victims as
S s s s s T . was given the job of
contract man.
Monday followed Sunday, as
expected, andafterthe evenings
standard refreshment several
people paid a visit to the hotel
they stayed in last year. They
were so heartily welcomed that
the owner gave them a few
pillows and some other various
items suitable for placing under
a coat. Meanwhile B i g and
L u i g i together with Jeffs,
Sutton and Wrigley who formed
L e Grand C i n g had returned
after the hotel was locked and
decided to stay in more
spacious accommodation in the
form of a partly built office
block. Bedding was sparse and
Lipscombe exercised his
authority as B i g and slept in a
cardboard box they had found.

R E V I E W
THIS Y E A R the C a p t a i n c y of the C r i c k e t C l u b has been split
to some degree in that the Sunday XI has been captained by
Graham Webb ahd Tom G h o s h ; the official C a p t a i n being Andrew
H a l l
For the 1st XI the season s o far, has been moderately s u c -
cessful with a record of 3 w i n s ,
1 draw, 3 lost and 5 matches
c a n c e l l e d due. to rain. The
exams have, as usual, taken
their toll of players and the
impossibility of s e l e c t i n g a
regular first team has been
rather frustrating.
The season began with two
excellent w i n s . In the first,
Heston were d i s m i s s e d for
only 40 (G. Webb 6-6) and IC
made the runs for the loss of
two w i c k e t s .
A f t e r a poor b a t t i n g
performance against South
Stanmore when IC were a l l out
for 88 (A. Ghosh 31), the
match was won by IC in an
e x c i t i n g finish in which
S . Stanmore were d i s m i s s e d for
84 (A. H a l l 4-12) only 4 runs
short!
A t S t . Johns, Cambridge on
May 3rd the 1 s f s were w e l l
beaten; St. Johns rather
laboriously compiled 175-5
then having given IC just over
2 hours to make the runs bowled
us out for 8 8 .
Next weekend (after a
c a n c e l l e d mid-week fixture)
against Magdalen Oxford it
At last the final day of the
tour arrived and everybody set
off to B r u s s e l s U n i v e r s i t y to
see IC thrash their opposition
by over fifty points to n i l . The
game was played at midday
thereby a l l o w i n g the whole of
the afternoon for s u p p i n g . A
mammoth singsong against our
friendly B e l g i a n entertainers
provided a fitting c l i m a x , w e l l
almost for G . Clement, for the
tour.
Everybody enjoyed them-
selves and I wish next years
organiser every success and
pity.

was IC's turn to laboriously
compile 169-8 ( D . Millard 48,
M. Taytor 44, J . England 29)
emulate St. Johns
but failed to emulate St. Johns
and lost by five w i c k e t s .
The first league match
against Whitton was cancelled
because of rain, each side
taking 5'points.
The next Wednesday the
f irst tra ve I led down to Haywards
Heath to play M i d . Sussex C . C .
where another poor batting
performance left the opposition
to make 88: which they did for
the loss of eight wickets
(A. Ha 1
1 5-30) after a concerted
attempt at redemption of our
batting failure.
Our second league match
was ca nee I led by the oppos i t i on
Motspur Park because they
would not raise a team, s o IC
took the maximum 15 points.
A seriously depleted 1st XI
met Hurlingham Oddfellows at
Harlington on May 28th where
they made 184-3 after 5 catches
had been dropped by our
recognised cricketers! A
generous declaration by the
opposition was not fully
explored when nearly a l l our
batsmen appeared to be
mesmerised into donating
their wickets.by a ridiculously
' e a s y ' slow bowler. However
IC held on to draw the match
finishing with 126-8 (A. H a l l
47 n.o.).
On Saturday 31st May,
probably the best IC 1st X I this
season batted miserably on a
fast wicket at C h u r c h i l l ,
Cambridge and were a l l out for
88 (yet again). However an
excellent bowling performance
by the medium paced bowler
kept C h u r c h i l l within our
meagre total and were a l l out
for 69 ( J . Bashar 5-20).
The season s o far has been
characterised by poor batting,
giving wickets away and
dropped catches. The wickets
have been lost by impatience
to score runs, e s p e c i a l l y to
ostensibly gentle bowling and
the catches have been dropped
due to lack of concentration.
However there is s t i l l much of
the s e a s o n , to come and of
course the tour!
