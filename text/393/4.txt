THE P A S T s e s s i o n has seen the R o y a l
College of Science Union continuing with
all of i t s traditional a c t i v i t i e s a n d
venturing into several totally new fields.
O v e r a l l , it has been a r e a s o n a b l y
s u c c e s s f u l year and it is hoped that a
firm foundation has been laid for next
years officers to build upon.
Our Sports C l u b s have a l l had very
good seasons, e s p e c i a l l y the Rugby and
Hockey c l u b s . R C S Rugby l s t X V did not
lose a match before Christmas and only
failed to regain the Sparkes C u p because
in the event of a tie, the holders retain i t .
RCS Hockey lost only one game out of
fourteen i n their s u c c e s s f u l campaign to
win the Stephenson C u p and to gain
promotion to the l s t d i v i s i o n of the U L
league. The T e c h C u p is the main reason
for the existence of R C S Soccer C l u b and
this was won by hammering Mines 5-2 and
Guilds 6-0. Rifle and Boat C l u b s both did
better than expected and have the basis
for good teams in the future .The academic
societies have continued to attract
interest i n both their lectures and brewery
trips. C h e m s o c a n d Biochemsoc have
been particularly a c t i v e .
The R a g effort reached its peak with
the Departmental C o l l e c t i o n s , in which a
barrel of beer was offered to the year that
collected most per h e a d . T h i s bait resulted
in the phenomenal sum of £1100 being
collected i n O N E d a y . T h e last stunt was
the most ambitious, a round-London
Treasure Hunt based o n the sites of the
'Monopoly' b o a r d . Other profitable
collections included a mock football
match outside Harrods and the alcoholic

THE R E - E M E R G E N C E of P H O E N I X
after an absence of some three years,
left me wondering (after reading it from
front to front) if the contents depicted
the genesis of budding young contemp-
orary artists or the w o r t h l e s s
meanderings of adolescent p l s s - a r t i s t s .
How would I know? I'll drink Watneys,
Tartan or a n y other liquid refreshment
provided I d o not have to pay more than
1p.
Anyway, I found the artwork in general
was down on previous i s s u e s , exceptions
being 'The Lost Cause' a n d N i c k
E u s t a n c e ' s piece. T h e poems of Messrs
Appleby a n d C l i m o -show that they
probably get their inspiration from
outside I C . ' The Audience' was obviously
the work of a genius.
Were the short stories (together with
'Art of Computing') the most worthwhile
inclusions? On balance, they probably
w e r e .
O v e r a l l , I suppose it would be fair to
say the Editor did a remarkable job getting
anything published at a l l , considering
4,000 eligible 'artists' seem to be
suffering from the 'apathy rules' syndrome.
Let us hope more than a handful of
students contribute material for the next
issue, and s o hopefully, raise the
standard.
S t i l l , it seems s o far to be a most
popular publication, by the way people
were buying it in the Union bar. B i l l
Gerrard going around like a Sdvation Army
Officer on a Saturday night s e l l i n g copies
of ' W a r c r y ! ' . . . or w a s it 'Young Soldier'?
carol s i n g i n g and these helped us to our
final total of £3700, the best for many
years.
The dinners, organised by R C S U , have
been characterised, for the first time i n
many years, b y efficent, smooth a n d
reliable organisation. T h e F r e s h e r s '
Dinner ' g a v e the newcomers i n each
department a n insight into the Union and
an opportunity to meet some members of
staff. T h i s run of dinners culminated i n
the one for the new D i v i s i o n of Life
S c i e n c e s , attended by the Rector, Dean,
no less than four Heads of Departments
and about 200 lesser mortals. During the
year two other formal dinners were he Id.
The first was a quality dinner to celebrate
the christening of the new Theta, which
occured, amid the popping of Champagne
bottle c o r k s , at 1930 hours o n Thursday
13th F e b r u a r y . T h e A n n u a l Dinner was
held early i n the summer term, attended
by some hundred people.
The U n i o n ' s Entertainments Committee,
after running a very popular Smoking
Concert, entered sketches in the other
C C U Revues and then experimented with
"Voluptuous Variety",an old Time M u s i c
h a l l . A lot of hard work was put into this
and despite the s m a l l audience it was very
w e l l received a n d there are plans for
another Music H a l l next year. The A n n u a l
B a l l was again held at Silwood Park and,
despite minor friction withsome residents,
was enjoyed by a l l attending. A d i s c o
was provided a s w e l l as the usual dance
band, cabaret, coffee lounge and bar. A n
extension of E n t s was to provide a regular
'Night Out' in the second term. T h i s grew
out of an idea used in R a g Week and these
events included ice skating and trips to
Cinema and Theatre.
Jezebel went, as a n observer, on the
V C C Brighton R u n in November and one of
the big-end bearings disintegrated. She
was towed back to C o l l e g e , arriving in
the very early hours and was off the road
for six months. After only 200 miles the
new bearing i s showing signs of wear and
so J e z i s , once again, i n pieces to
determine the cause a n d apply some
preventitive m e d i c i n e . After the loss of
Theta to G u i l d s and its subsequent
recovery following a protracted 'treasure'
hunt, construction of a new Theta was
begun. It now c o n s i s t s of a s t a i n l e s s
steel bulb with s i x feet of hydraulic
piping attached. T h e whole weighs over
1 OOlbs and the bulb is engraved with an
RCS C r o w n , a c a p i t a l ' T h e t a ' a n d the
year ' 1 9 7 5 ' . T h e stem has a logarithmic
scale from zero to infinity.
On the publicity a n d retail side,
Broadsheet has continued to be published
and the range of R C S goods available has
been extended. Broadsheet appeared
fortnightly for the first two terms and i n
the last issue contained several pages of
lithoed photographs, the quality of which
e a s i l y r i v a l l e d F E L I X . (Who is Mike
Williams anyway?). R C S S l o p p a n d T-shirts
have been s e l l i n g w e l l and new lines
include s i n g l e t s , long-sleeved T - s h i r t s ,
RCS H o l d - a l l s a n d Theta s h i r t s .
The year has marked a distinct
improvement in R C S U / R C S A (Old Students
Association)co-operation and co-ventures.
The two organisations have shared a
handbook for several years and, to enable
present students to meet past ones, R C S A
ran a series of sherry parties for second
year students .
The past year has seen the start of the
end of an era for the U n i o n . R C S U goes
into s e s s i o n 1975/76 having — hopefully
— moved into a suite of offices i n the
newly completed W2 and a l s o equipped
with a new mascot, unviolated to date,
thanks to the efforst of Dad's Army. The
Union must cater for a l l tastes and thus
its officers must make a l l possible efforts
to find out the views of the Union members
and the U n i o n members must tell their
officers what they want done. This is
necessary in order that the R o y a l College
of Science Union may continue to play its
role in college life .

1974-75 H A S seen many changes i n
Guilds Union some temporary, like a
female President, others like the improve-
ment of the E x e c e t c not hopefully just
a one year thing.
We started off the year with a very
s u c c e s s f u l if exhausting Freshers week
when we seemed to entertain the freshers
to beer, and yet more beer. The first bar
night w a s very good with Chem E n g 3
staking their c l a i m to the crown of
champion boat racers!
Freshers Dinners went off very w e l l
too, apart from Dave's and my grey hairs
at the Chem E n g Dinner when we fully
expected a fierce battle with R C S having
previously 'borrowed' their mascot from
the Maths Freshers Dinner. Which very
neatly brings me on to that topic very dear
to the hearts of a l l of us this year:-
mascotry. T h i s year we have suceeded in
taking three mascots, Theta from R C S
Davy from R S M a n d Phineas from U C .
Apart from the terrific prestige and glory
it has given to G u i l d s I hope that we have
started up the mascotry war again, which
I think is a very important part of beling-
ing to a C C U . Already R C S and R S M have
made them new much more nickable
mascots. F i e l d cup happened(?) again and
much to our surprise, a s shame on us we
were not too sure w h o Management
Science were, the trendy executives in the
pin striped suits w o n by drinking vast
quantities of beer wine whiskey g i n . . . .
honest guv I didn't let them bribe me!
B o went down to Brighton yet again,
(even though we did not have an official
entry) and has a l s o just come back from
the Manchester to B l a c k p o o l Run with
just a couple of pieces o f silverware!
The pedal car c l u b went off to B r i s t o l
again, and although they had scrapped the
event that we normally win without t e l l i n g
us we managed to win one prize. Motor
C l u b too has been organising r a l l i e s ,
treasure hunts and auto-tests. Its very
nice to see the 'Old Lags' turning out for
these events.
C a r n i v a l did not happen as usual in the
first term, but eventually we held it in the
first week of the spring term. At long last
the saga of the damage is now over and
we have paid £100 towards alleged
damage. I think that C a r n i v a l w i l l not be
in College B l o c k for a while. The Dinner
and Dance, although an outstanding
s u c c e s s , was not very w e l l attended and
I c a n see there being problems i n the
future organising the more formal type of
event within the students pocket.
Revue was the other traditional event
that happened and this too was s u c c e s s f u l
with apparently a pretty ropey stripper.
We tried some G u i l d s outings too this
year: we went on a pub crawl and to the
cinema and hopefully they w i l l be extended
and improved ne.xt year.
Sportingwise too we seem to have
been fairly s u c c e s s f u l : we won the
sparkes C u p (just) a n d the Courtman
Shield (overwhelmingly).
Our Union meetings have not been
very w e l l attended, partly due to the
rather rowdy affairs that they have become
but we have had a couple of very amusing
ones the best being I think the handover
meeting at the Albert Memorial where
apparently we broke every rule i n the
book.
A s I said I think that we have had a
good year this year despite many setbacks
and I hope that next year C i t y and G u i l d s
Union w i l l go from strength to strength.
