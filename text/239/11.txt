STUDENT-HOUSES AT IC?
I n view of the f a c t that only a t h i r d of the students at IC ever spend a year $n
one of the H a l l s of Residence, a group of students conducted a survey at the
beginning of t h i s term i n t o the l i v i n g c o n d i t i o n s of students i n digs, f l a t s , etc»
The organisers were concerned about the remoteness and poor q u a l i t y of some of the
accommodation which was o f f e r e d to IC °t"dentr
- by the lodgings Bursar. They a l s o
bore i n mind the recommendations of the Robbins report i n i t s preferences to
students accommodation and H a l l s of Residence.
The main recommendation of t h e i r report on the survey was that C o u n c i l should
investgate the establishment of student-'houses,, These are b u i l d i n g s which are
run s o l e l y by students and might also be owned by the Union. Student-houses
already e x i s t i n London and H u l l , I t would cost of the order of £30,000 to buy
and convert such a house and i t i s hoped that i t w i l l be p o s s i b l e to g6t f i n a n c e
from outside the College to help y/ith thife. Council approved the report and asked
the Welfare O f f i c e r to look i n t o the f i n a n c i a l s i t u a t i o n ,

A proposal to introduce 'guest' membership of ICU S o c i e t i e s was discussed at the l a s t
Union C o u n c i l meeting, Mr Prank Echs was continuing h i s aim of b r i n g i n g about
co-operation between IC and the Royal College of A r t , He suggested that clubs
should change an 'Economic' membership fee to students from other c o l l e g e s which
might be equivalent to the subsidy which clubs r e c e i v e from the Union. He emphasised
that the c o l l e g e s e l i g i b l e f o r membership would have to be approved by C o u n c i l - IC
would not want to be swamped by l a r g e numbers of e x t e r n a l students.
The proposal, was d i s c u s s e d at length, brlnghg i n reference to organisations such as
the Dramatic Societyoar the Opera Group, which depend on e x t e r n a l memoers f o r t h e i r
productions. The aim was to n a t i o n a l i s e the present s i t u a t i o n where some clubs had
u n o f f i c i a l members from other colleges and were u n c e r t a i n of the status and l e g a l
p o s i t i o n of these people. The p o s i t i o n of such members as regards insurance i n such
s o c i e t i e s as the Underwater Club was viewed w i t h concern.
The matter was•referred to the e x t e r n a l a f f a i r s Committee and i t was decided to set
up sin ad hoc committee to i n v e s t i g a t e tn. l e g a l aspects.
