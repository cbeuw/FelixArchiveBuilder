tendency to eulogise t h e interpreter
of a w o r k of a r t , rather than t h e

of a piece o f music rather t h a n t h e
composer, or t h e newspaper a r t

papers use their journalists as ' c u l t -

Management amateurs-

British management is 'disreput-
able, nepotistic, conservative, and
amateurish compared to that in
the USA and Germany. This,
according to Mr J.P. Carruthers,
a lecturer at LSE, has been the
fact, that has been responsible
for the Trades Unions' continued,
association with the Labour
Party.

The exploitation of nuclear energy clearly necessitates the application
of the most advanced knowledge to ensure satisfactory performance
from the materials involved. Similarly, in conventional generation systems,
significant improvements in the performance of traditional materials can
be achieved through basic and applied research. The demand for
electricity doubles every nine years and at present the daily capital
investment is around £1,500,000.
Scientists of the highest calibre are required to investigate problems such
as the creep of metals, irradiation effects, corrosion and fracture processes.
There is therefore a requirement

MATHEMATICIANS ENGINEERS
AS WELL AS
METALLURGISTS
Young scientists with relevant research experience are particularly
welcome. Much of the work is comparable with that carried out in
universities and close links are maintained with laboratories doinq
similar work. Publication of research is actively encouraged as is the
implementation of its results in the operational field. There are excellent
and progressive salary scales, conditions and prospects
