FOURTH XI
SCRAPE HOME
T H E F I R S T G O A L was not scored until the fourth minute and
by half time it was only 7-0 to I.C. A minute before the end of
play the 4th's had just celebrated the twentieth goal with the twenty-
ifirst, and extra-time now seemed impossible.
Through the match I.C. played excellent football, although the
opposition were clearly sub-4ths standard. Only the Guy's goal-
keeper and centre half put up any resistence—without these the
score might have been much different. However, I.C. had to be
content with 21, of which Brian Hall got 9, and Atkins, at centre
half, got one valuable goal (the 17th, it is thought).
I.C. failed to conceed a goalkick or corner, and Bill Caruthers
in goal, started to look for another job. The 4th's now advance
to the quarter-finals, and play U.C.III (away) on January 21st.
Its the early team that gets wet
T H E 7 t h X I IS p r o b a b l y tAe most p u n c t u a l of teams in the Soccer C l u b .
T o p l a y a c u p game against West H a m , w i t h a k i c k o i l at 11 a.m. Saturday
10th D e c e m b e r , the players were asked to meet i n the U n i o n at 9.15.
A t 9.00 they w e r e a l l present a n d correct, t h o u g h soaked . from the rain,
a n d trailed off into the r a i n once again on their journey to W e s t H a m .
H o w e v e r , the game was postponed a n d the t h i r d attempt to p l a y it
w i l l soon occur. T h e i r spirit, if not dedication, to the g a m e is an example
that the rest of t h e c l u b s h o u l d note.
It's a pity that keenness does not always b r i n g its' deserved r e w a r d —
but p e i h a p s it does, even though it's cleverly hidden.

RUGBY FIVES SHOOTING-
A l t h o u g h h a p p i l y active this year,
the R u g b y F i v e s C l u b is suffering
from a distinct lack of experienced
players. T h i s has been clearly
brought out b y o u r poor m a t c h r e -
c o r d of w i n n i n g o n l y o n e of o u r s j i
fixtures.

to make predictions, b u t late enough
to express confidence.
