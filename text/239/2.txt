Memories of Wells
by Lord Snow
The H . G . Wells Centenary Lecture organised by the National
Wells Society was given by Lord Snow. Lord Snow gave an in-
formal lecture, as he said Wells did not approve of formally, and
spoke of his personal impressions of Wells.

In Unilever,
management is more
than a career...
. . . it has acquired the status of a profession and, as such, requires
highly developed skills - skills that are never found ready made. For this
reason we have evolved a comprehensive system of management training and
development for young men and women of outstanding calibre.
Unilever is the sixth largest company in the world, with about 300,000
employees in 80 countries. We make and sell consumer products which are
household names and produce raw and manufactured materials for other
industries.
A high proportion of the management of this widely diversified company
are graduates. For 40 years we have been systematically recruiting students
from Universities.
Challenging Opportunities for Scientists and Arts Graduates
In Unilever, we do not simply accept change, we play a large part in
creating it. Keeping the company in the forefront of its field means many
intellectually exacting and satisfying jobs for scientists and technologists,
for economists, mathematicians, sociologists and all types of Arts graduates.
No matter what your discipline at University, you have a wide choice of
career in Unilever. A physicist might well turn to Market Research. Or a
Zoologist to running a factory. The direction you take is largely up to you.
If you are interested in a career in Unilever, our booklet on the Unilever
Companies' Management Development Scheme gives simply and factually
much of the information you will require - the structure of the Company,
prospects, how training is carried out and an indication of some of the things
you mightfindyourself doing if you joined. It also contains details of the
selection procedure and how to apply.
If you would like to know more about the U.C.M.D.S., and about
Unilever, ask your Appointments Officer for our booklet,
"Careers in Unilever 1967", or write to: C. R. Stewart, Personnel Division,
Unilever House, London, E.C.4.
A manager from Unilever will be visiting your University during the
Spring Term to interview students. Details of his visit can be had
from your Appointments Officer.
