FELIX 7
An Open Letter to Congregat-
ion of Oxford University and
Cambridge University Senate...
Sirs,
In the national interest I m u s t
urgently ask y o u to a b a n d o n this
year's B o a t R a c e a n d a l l t h e others
to come. There's n o need to p u t
J o h n Snagge or the rosette-sellers out
o f business. A l l I w a n t y o u to d o is
otter tbe racci to L i v e r p o o l a n d M a n -
chester Universities on the M e r s e y ,
E x e ' e r a n d Bristol on the Severn or
to Y o r k a n d L a n r ^ s t e r on some
stream on the Y o r k s h i r e moors (it
just means using smaller boats).
M y o w n choice is a race b e t w e e n
E d i n b u r g h a n d St. A n d r e w ' s on
the F i r t h of F o r t h because there are
strong offshore currents a n d t h e
nation likes its boats to sink at least
once i n a generation. I see n o v a l i d
reason w h y these t w o u n i v e r s i t i e s —
or the others I l i s t — s h o u l d have to
continue to d e p e n d solely o n their
fine a c a d e m i c records for their i m a g e
i n the w o r l d .
Y o u k n o w , gentlemen, the i m p o r t -
ance of h a v i n g a n i m a g e today. B u t
O x f o r d a n d C a m b r i d g e h a v e m o r e
than a n image. T h e y have a legend,
a m y t h w h i c h often has n o t h i n g
to do w i t h the facts. A n d I t h i n k its
getting out of control.

The Oxbridge Myth
by Joshua O'Keefe
T a k e this t e r m . O n e Saturday
m o r n i n g the B B C ' s 2 a . m . news bul-
letin took it for granted that l i g h t -
housekeepers, nightshift workers a n d
anyone else still a w a k e w o u l d n e e d
to k n o w that : ' T h e O x f o r d U n i o n
still has a m a n as president'. T h e
f o l l o w i n g W e d n e s d a y they were t o l d
that the election h a d been a n n u l l e d
a n d the first-ever g i r l candidate,
Janet M o r g a n h a d a second chance.
O n T h u r s d a y , w h e n the suspense o n
s h o p floors was assumed to be near
b r e a k i n g - p o i n t , c a m e the news that
she w o u l d not stand again.
N o w gentlemen, y o u a n d I k n o w
that a w o m a n president wouldn't
m a k e a scrap of real difference to the
O x f o r d U n i o n ' s m a i n l y m o d e r n teen-
agers. T h e O x f o r d Student C o u n c i l
quietly elected a s p l e n d i d girl c h a i r -
m a n t w o years ago. Nevertheless,
M i s s M o r g a n was g i v e n the d r a m a t i c
image of a girl s t o r m i n g a k i n d of
talkative monastery. O r take the
U n i o n mini-skirt debate w h i c h a
national newspaper columnist f o u n d
u n w o r t h y of this shrine of great t a l k
w h e r e great m i n d s have forged r i n g -
i n g phrases a n d unleashed waves of
w i t on the issues of the day...'
E m b a r a s s i n g , isn't it ? Y o u a n d I
k n o w that w h e n the U n i o n wants
r i n g i n g phrases it invites Q u i n t i n
H o g g a n d w h e n it wants w i t it asks
M i c h a e l Beloft. W e also k n o w t h a t
only a h a n d f u l of people i n a n y
O x f o r d generation are great a n y -
things. T h e rest are l e a r n i n g to be
brilliant, clever, competent, (crooked
or arrant nincompoops at life. T h e
stirring of a great talent, in the
U n i o n or at a tutorial is still a rare
a n d t h r i l l i n g event.
B u t w h a t counts is that people be-
lieve the m y t h . F o r i m p l a n t i n g this
belief I t h i n k w e c a n thank t h e B o a t
R a c e . I h e a r d m y first one at the
age of five a n d it was m a n y years
before I realised that Britain h a d
a n y other universities. B y the t i m e I
d i d , I was too mesmorised to care
about t h e m . I h a d graduated to the
other O x b r i d g e m y t h s — J o w e t t ' s
O x f o r d , R u p e r t Brooke's C a m b r i d g e ,
C h r i s t C h u r c h M e a d o w . M y brother
w o r r i e d m e b y c o m i n g out of
Leicester U n i v e r s i t y w i t h a better-
trained m i n d than anyone I k n e w at
C a m b r i d g e but perhaps that was just
a personal accident.
W h a t I suggest is that O x b r i d g e
is n o w so b u l g i n g w i t h myths that
she m i g h t start b e l i e v i n g t h e m herself.
S h e s h o u l d get r i d of at least one f a b l -
e d institution. T h e gift of the B o a t
R a c e , one of the great p r i m e v a l
clashes of British life, w o u l d give an
enormous leg-up to a n y other t w o
universities.
A n d the G o v e r n m e n t w o u l d b e so
grateful to y o u that it m i g h t at last
stop m u t t e r i n g about setting u p
R o y a l C o m m i s i o n s to find out w h a t
y o u get u p to b e h i n d a l l those myths.

H i s h a n d then appears to have o n l y

partner has opened the b i d d i n g , E a s t
wants to be i n at least a g a m e
contract. T h e direct b i d of 3 N T e n -
