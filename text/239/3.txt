S e l w y n L l o y d recently visited a l u n c h - t i m e meeting of C o n S o c to give
a general talk on the present p o l i t i c a l scene. H e opened his talk on the
subject ot V i e t n a m , stating that this issue is the most important i n foreign
affairs. H e thought that the eontliet could only b e settled around a c o n -
ference table w i t h the A m e r i c a n s a n d the Chinese negotiating a joint w i t h -
d r a w a l to leave V i e t n a m as a flabby, central p a d between these rivals.
H e also telt, though; that the A m e r i c a n s should keep u p their offensive,
i n c l u d i n g b o m b i n g raids, until negotiations start, as the C o m m u n i s t s are
no respectors ot weakness'. H e d i d not otter a m e t h o d of achieving
negotiations other than g i v i n g the C h i n e s e a full seat i n t h e U N security
c o u n c i l .
C o n t i n u i n g w i t h foreign affairs,
he thought that a settlement of t h e
Rhodesian situation w o u l d c o m e
more easily f r o m negotiations than
from sanctions w h i c h w o u l d affect
the Z a m b i a n a n d British economies
a n d w o u l d solidify the w h i t e
Rhodesians b e h i n d the S m i t h
government. H e felt that the colour-
ed citizen of R h o d e s i a s h o u l d not b e
given a n i m m e d i a t e vote b u t
Britain should send a 'large s u m ' t o
Rhodesia to be spent o n a massive
educational drive to fit t h e c o l o u r e d
citizen for a vote.
C o n c e r n i n g t h e role of B r i t a i n i n
the defence of t h e free w o r l d , h e
said that w e h a v e t a k e n too m u c h
on ourselves a n d w e s h o u l d h a n d
over m a n y of o u r responsibilities to
other nations. H e d i d n o t , h o w e v e r ,
say h o w w e w e r e to get r i d of these
commitments.
T u r n i n g t o domestic issues, h e
spoke of his surprise that w e d i d
not have a m u c h worse balance of
payments crisis i n v i e w of t h e w a y
industry has b e e r u n since the w a r .
A s for the present balance of p a y -
ments crisis, he gave n o real solution
but he w a r n e d against devaluation
of the p o u n d .
C o n t i n u i n g , he criticised the pre-
sent government for increasing th<
p o w e r of tlie state i n five sectors of
the economy. H e slated the nation-
alisation plans for steel a n d t h e set-
ting u p of the n e w national author-
ities for freight, l a n d etc; he dis-
a p p r o v e d of the a b a n d o n i n g of his
o w n N a t i o n a l E c o n o m i c D e v e l o p -
ment C o u n c i l , the introduction of

D u r i n g question time, he said
that h e w o u l d like to see a revision
of trade u n i o n l a w t o set u p a r e -
strictive practices court for the
unions a n d to increase the p o w e r of

T h e m e e t i n g h a d to b e w o u n d u p
through lack of t i m e at 4.30 a n d the
enthusiastic applause reflected t h e
