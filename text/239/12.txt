BRA l l â€¢ CASHING- AFP VOODOO
That no normal person can withstand i n d e f i n i t e l y the methods of brainwashing
or Voodoo was a large p a r t of the message i n Dr "'f.W. Sargent's address t o Wellsoc
on Monday night.
He introduced the mechanics of brainwashing by comparing the r e s u l t s of h i s own work
on war neuroses during the second world War with e x t r a c t s from John Wesley's j o u r n a l
d e a l i n g with h i s methods of conversion t o Methodism. He then went on t o given a
b r i e f o u t l i n e of Pavlov's theory of psychology, and explained the c o r r e l a t i o n between
Pavlov's work on dogs and the e f f e c t s of war neurosis.
Using f i l m s and s l i d e s , he demonstrated the various states of b r a i n i n h i b i t i o n
p r e d i c t e d by Pavlov, p a r t i c l u a r l y with reference t o Voodoo and C h r i s t i a n Revivalism.
He showed that the main processes i n t h i s type of ceremony- are rythmic oxorcisos, t o
drums or clapping hands, and overbreathing. At the same time ho showed examples t o
demonstrated that people with chronic mental i l l n e s s e s were unaffected by these
methods. He l a t e r quoted extreme f a i t h as the ether p r o t e c t i o n against those
methods, saying that a person who possessed f a i t h , and could net be angered by
the brainwashor, would hold out lengest.
Dr Sargant gave i n t e r e s t i n g l e c t u r e which must have given the 120 people present
p l e n t y t o t h i n k about.

requested that such property that has been 'borrowed' bo returned immediately t o

SIR
I t d i s t u r b s mo t o know t h a t , i n a c i t y with such a crime r a t e , even a group of
amateur c r i m i n a l s can enter our Union b u i l d i n g , 'work f o r an appreciable time with an
cxy-acetylene c u t t e r and then leave undcte. ted.
Surely the Union should bo able t o a f f o r d bettor p r o t e c t i o n than t h i s f o r the
b u i l d i n g and i t s contents.
