World Government
in two generations:
Federalism
Speaking on 'Federalism—a System of World Government' Russell
Johnston (Liberal MP Inverness) said he found it entirely consistent
that he was in his lecture apparently advocating a massive central-
isation of Government and that next Wednesday (30 November) he
was asking to introduce a Bill giving Home Rule to Scotland.
These w e r e b o t h part of F e d e r a l -
ism, a system in w h i c h a c h a i n of
decision m a k i n g bodies dealt w i t h
problems w i t h i n t h e i r areas w i t h
k n o w l e d g e , concern a n d involvment.
Problems w o u l d be dealt w i t h by
representatives of the p e o p l e to
w h o m they really m e a n t something.
T h e regional authorities a n d the
w o r l d authority w o u l d be e q u a l p a r t -
ners w i t h their o w n sharply d e n n e d
area of G o v e r n m e n t . T h i s m e t h o d of
G o v e r n m e n t , a c h i e v i n g freedom for
individuals a n d groups was a p a r t i c u l -
arly liberal one. It recognised the
existence of nations a n d c o m m u n i t i e s
w i t h i n states, each w i t h its o w n w a y
of achieving l i b e r t y a n d justice for
its members. T h e r e must obviously
b e universal standards of justice for
people regardless of race, c r e e d or
w e a l t h a n d these must be safeguard-
ed by the W o r l d A u t h o r i t y , however,
maintenance of these standards c o u l d
best be affected b y those w i t h i n t i m -
ate kowiedge of the particular abuses
to w h i c h their region was most prone.
T h e r e is n o easy f o r m u l a for
the reduction of friction b e t w e e n
states, or i n fact, b e t w e e n nations
w i t h i n states. S h o u l d a major block
w i s h to go against the rest of the
w o r l d , it w o u l d still need to be c o n -
fronted b y another large block.
T h e r e is, however, the chance that a
statutory system of international re-
lations (such as E E C or U N O ) d r a w n
up in the presence of t h i r d parties
w o u l d be better adhered to than the
eixsting a d hoc system of treaties a n d
p o w e r blocks. T h i r d parties c a n
often see solutions to w h i c h the
quarrelling parties are b l i n d .
UNO
T h e basis for such an organisation
is obviously U N O . T h e fact that so
m a n y people in E u r o p e have m a n a g -
e d to forget T'^eir nationalism to
t h i n k as E u r o p e a n s and m o v e -
ments such as U N O and O A U have
f o r m e d means that at last people are
l o o k i n g b e y o n d nationalism. M r
Johnston was confident that such a
system of W o r l d G o v e r n m e n t was
feasible w i t h i n two generations.

W i t h the p r i z e - g i v i n g o n F r i d a y
9 t h D e c e m b e r , the A r t of Science
exhibition put up the shutters for a n -
other 2 0 years, w h e n the "guess the
changes" competition w i l l be judged.
T h e p r i z e - g i v i n g , a quiet, respect-
a b l e affair i n M e c h E n g concourse,
was effected in the m i n i m u m of time
a n d f o l l o w e d b y sherry for the 25
p e o p l e present.
In converse w i t h the D e a n of
R . C . A . , w h o gave a w a y the prizes,
it emerged that although impressed
by the h i g h standard of the " A r t "
exhibits he thought that on the
w h o l e the science-inspired w o r k s
tended to w e H e a t h R o b i n s o n a n d
u n t i d i l y executed. T h e exhibit he
p i c k e d out as being p a r t i c u l a r l y g o o d
was P h i l l i p Painter's p r i z e - w i n n i n g
music entry, (ocmposed b y r a n d o m
selection from telephone numbers),
w h i c h he said was consistent w i t h
the modern-art opinion that a r a n d -
om-process creation was often m o r e
beautiful than one m a d e by selective
thought.
T h a t the p r i z e g i v i n g should have
been h e l d i n such an open area a-;
M e c h E n g concourse was unfortunate
as it m a d e the atmosphere very i m -
personal, b u t otherwise this was a
pleasant e n d to W e l l s Society's m e m o -
rial to H . G . W e l l s .

R . S . M . U n i o n made a loss of £ 5 0 on the Freshers' D i n n e r s . T h i s was
the b a l d statement made by President M o l a m w h o cast some of the b l a m e
on the G e o l o g y D e p t . for their poor attendance at their d e p a r t m e n t a l dinner.
T h e deficit c o u l d have been e x p l a i n e d more fully.
V i c e -President O ' R e i l l y suitably
h u m b l e , apologised for the presence
of R . C . S . a n d G u i l d s at the Prospect
of W h i t b y on M o r p h y D a y . H i s
h u m i l i t y was quite gone, however,
w h e n he tongue-lashed the gathering
for the apathy s h o w n towards the
collection for the M u s c u l a r D y s t r o p h y
Research F u n d . H e urged support
support f r o m more t h a n just the
hard-core w h o always support these
functions. M i n e s m e n w e r e also u r g e d
to support the F o r e i g n Students' visit
this week.
T h e 'Stevenson letter' was read to
the m e e t i n g a n d M o l a m c o m m e n t e d
that M o r p h y D a y should be retained
"as the o n l y t i m e d u r i n g the year
w h e n the students, as a b o d y , c a n
let their hair d o w n i n p u b l i c " . C o m -
ments from the floor substantiated
this attitude, it w o u l d be interesting
to k n o w the private views of m e m -
bers of the U n i o n on this issue.
T h e C l e m . A u c t i o n was squeezed
into the r e m a i n i n g part of the meet-
ing, b i d d i n g was sluggish a n d the
highest price fetched was 32.6 for
one article. I n a l l about £ 1 3 were
raised, the meeting ran late so that
not a l l the items w e r e sold.

referendum
It seems likely that as far as R C S
U n i o n is concerned, the N U S issue is
dead. Despite the close result i n last
Tuesdays' r e f e r e n d u m , there is little
doubt that R R C S G e n e r a l C o m m i t t e e
w i l l accept the results as final.
T h e referendum was h e l d to de-
cide w h e t h e r R C S U n i o n s h o u l d
again a p p l y for m e m b e r s h i p of N U S .
T h e final vote was 349 F o r ' a n d 392
Against w i t h 45 abstentions a n d 10
spoilt papers. T h i s represents a
majority of 43 against w h i c h is less
than the abstentions. T h e total v o t e
of nearly 800 shows that only just
over h a l f R C S U bothered to vote on
this important issue.
T h e general feeling seems to be
that this is the e n d of the issue for
this year. T h e proposers M r . B o o t h -
m a n a n d M r . F u c h s both accepted
the referendum vote as final. M r .
F u c h s said that the referendum show-
ed that R C S has some interest i n
external affairs, a n d that he w o u l d
be t u r n i n g his attention to other is-
sues.

TheStevenson'
letter
T h e 'Stevenson letter' referred to
in the report on the M i n e s ' U n i o n
m e e t i n g comes as a result of M r .
Stevenson's visit to the towpath on
M o r p h y D a y . M r . Stevenson, the
Senior W a r d e n , is responsible for
the behaviour of I C students w h e n
not on C o l l e g e or U n i o n property.
H e was extremely annoyed w i t h what
he saw at M o r p h y and at one point
threatened the combatants w i t h the
demise1
of M o r p h y D a y if thev cros-
sed a bridge on the towpath. T h e let-
ter questions the necessity for the
battles; h o w e v e r , p u t t i n g the quest-
ion to a U n i o n meeting seems u n -
likely to produce a decision to a b a n d -
on t h e m .
