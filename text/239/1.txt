Alarms fail
Now at U C
MIKE, IC's new, unstealable mascot lasted just five weeks.
Beetween 1.30 and 5.30 am last Thursday it was removed from its
plinth in the Union lower lounge. The vice-jaws, which gripped the
body, were cut with an oxy-acetylene torch; the ring which circled
the barrel had been broken in an attempt on the previous Monday
by drilling and chiselling and was removed using toe torch.
It appears that one of the thieves stayed in the Union after it was
closed on Wednesday night by Acting Duty Officer Tony Duke.
The Union doors facing into Beit Quad were chained to repel de-
fenders. The other assailants entered through the back entrance
which was opened by unscrewing the lock. It is estimated that the
operation would take some forty minutes to complete.
T h e mascot was supposed to be
protected by ingenious a l a r m system
so that any tampering w o u l d set o i l
tne siren. H o w e v e r , on the night of
tiie r a i d none of these systems was
connected, the W o o d e n H o r s e O r g a n -

A l s o it is againest the rules to d a -

the cutting torch w o u l d easily melt
the brass body.

The damaged, empty plinth
Guilds at play
'We've mucked this place up'
The characteristic atmosphere of a Guild's Union meeting—4
parts nitrogen, 1 part oxygen and n parts paper darts, was well in
evidence at the last meeting and the hornblowers, tablethumpers and
chorus chanters had their usual field day. What were not character-
istic of a Guild's meeting were the excesses of the meeting which
was never fully under control. In their exuberance and recklessness,
many members, encouraged by the Union officers, exceeded the
limits of safety and decency : to set fire to a paper dart and then
•htow it into the audience cannot be excused on any grounds,
especially in the finest lecture theatre in the College.
C.E.Ms owl
T h e noise level subsided only dur-
i n g the presentation of r o w i n g
colours, after w h i c h President Pete
Roberts adjourned the meeting a n d
convened an E x t r a o r d i n a r y G e n e r a l
M e e t i n g to pass some constitutional
changes. W i t h o u t further explanation
he then declared that whatever he
w i s h e d to pass was passed. M o n o -
syllabic objections were raised to
this unjustifiably h i g h - h a n d e d attit-
ude, these were completely ignored.
S w i m m i n g G a l a
H a v i n g thus abandoned the constit-
ution, the meeting passed on to h i g h -
er matters as P h i l M a r s h a l l leapt o n -
to the stage in a neck to knee b a t h -
ing suit a n d cardboard banana horns,
w h i l e his accomplice, R o g W h i t e , i n
similar dress, b o u n d e d from b l a c k -
board to black-board scribbling sex-
ual graffiti. "You m a y w o n d e r w h y
w e are w e a r i n g this spastic gear'
said M a r s h a a l l , and offerred the forth-
c o m i n g s w i m m i n g gala as an excuse.
D e f e n d i n g himself from a hail of
paper, chalk a n d a probing lecture
pointer, by w a v i n g his helmet, the
G u i l d ' s V i c e President spent a
boisterous ten minutes alternatively
describing future G u i l d ' s activities,
a n d shouting for order. Characteristic-
ally, he placed great emphasis on
free booze in his address.
T e remainder of the meeting was
taken up w i t h children's games,
laughingly called a competition. T h e
basis oi these was an inter-year c o n -
test i n v o l v i n g the bursting of b a l -
loons by sheer l u n g p o w e r a n d
the eating of drv W e e t a b i x . It
also involved t r a m p l i n g said W e e t -
abix into the doer and smashing
one pint m u g . T h e result was
never in doubt, since R e g W h i t e ,
finding nothing better to do w i t h his
piece of chalk, wrote the winners.
C i v i l s , plainly on the b o a r d — a n d
C i v i l s it was. A l l parties cheated
vigorously, casting sporting instincts
aside, and the lure of the prize,
a largo volume of beer. was
so groat that a tti' ;le broke out in
the w i n n i n g team over the distribut-
ion of the bootv.
