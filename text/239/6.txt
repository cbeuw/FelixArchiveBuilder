Si I wood Park
The medieval assayer had a simple way of grading that most pre-
cious of metals. By rubbing a piece of gold of known purity on
the touchstone and comparing the streak with that of the piece in
question, he determined its purity and value. A bit inaccurate and
haphazard perhaps, but it served. And so does its modern allegorical
substitute, for at Silwood Park one can rub one's brains against
another's and compare the resulting parks. Touchstone provides the
opportunity, largely lost to technocrats who must deal with argu-
ments that are tor the most part cut and dried, to argue about ab-
stractions, to philosophise, to relax and baggie over questions that
nave no simpie answers, or no answers at all. The Park itself is
the ideal place for such a garthering; its serene peacefulness evokes
the kind ot emotion that must have prompted men who travelled
the world to sentimentalize about green England.
T h e t r i p f r o m L o n d o n makes t h e
transition easily. U g l y , dirty industr-
ial central megalopolis occasionally
r e l i e v e d b y i m a g i n a t i v e architecture
gives w a y to t h e u n i f o r m m e d i o c r i t y
that is s u b u r b i a w i t h its rows of semi-
d e t a c h e d d w e l l i n g s , neat s m a l l g a r d -
ens, hedges, small n e w i s h l o o k i n g
c a r s — a n d finally, t h e countryside i t -
self. N o w t h e contrast is i m m e d i a t e .
Greenness a n d brownness c o m e

stupor. T h e gates of S i l w o o d P a r k

a tree-lined drive. A once magnificent
E n g l i s h c o u n t r y estate, stands o n a
rise i n the l a n d w i t h its skirt of
l a w n s stretching majestically a w a y t o
fields b e y o n d . T h e house is s o r r o u n d -

M o d e r n brick structures h o u s i n g labs
a n d l i v i n g quarters f o r t h e residents,
unfortunately clash w i t h the more
ornate architecture of t h e house i t -
self. T o o n e side i s a unsightly
h u d d l e composed of prefab refrectory
a n d quonset huts i n w h i c h , w e are
i n f o r m e d , w e w i l l sleep. T h e majesty
of the p l a c e lessens w i t h t h e news.

ever is w a r m a n d i n v i t i n g — i n v i t i n g
too for t h e sandwiches, cakes a n d
tea spread around. H e r e , despite t h e
collection of l e a r n e d b i o l o g i c a l
journals, t h e atmosphere of the
c o u n t r v estate U retained. O n e relax-
es a n d talks easily. T h e n a r k a n d its
auiet serenity remove the tensions
of the citv. T h e m i n d shifts into

a m o r e dubious affect o n t h e m i n d .
T h e next m o r n i n g is leisurely, filled
w i t h t h e S u n d a y papers, talk, or a
w a l k a r o u n d t h e estate. F r o m t h e
w i n d o w at the b a c k of t h e house
there is a v i e w of a small neat
garden, encompassed b y lawns a n d
large trees. W a l k i n g d o w n the
lawns, o n e is o v e r w h e l m e d b y t h e
quiet solitude; there are almost
groups of E d w a r d i a n ladies p l a y i n g
croquet o n the smooth grass. T h i s

the house.
F r o m t h e w o o d s o n e comes u n -
expectedly u p o n the house, suddenly
to b e p l u n g e d again into t h e last
century. I t is raining, a n d no-one
e(se is a b o u t ; the garden is free for
the w a l k i n g a n d savouring of its
Eeace a n d c a l m . T o o b a d about the
uts a n d m o d e r n touches, too bad...
In t h e afternoon, after l u n c h , w e
gather again w h e r e w e started, a n d

great minds..., or d o a l l scientists
t e n d to c o n f o r m ?
Still, t h e return t o L o n d o n a n d
reality is a trip h o m e f r o m a spa,
rejuvenated a n d refreshed.
