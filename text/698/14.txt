• A r t B l a k e y returned to
London again last week for a
fortnight in residence at
Ronnie Scott's. It seems that
Ronnie's repertoire is taking a
distinctly perennial turn: the
same blooms come up year
after year. Blakey's line up
was the same too; featuring
Donald 'Duck' Harrison on
alto and saxello, and Art's new
right hand man, trumpeter
Terence Blanchard. Impec-
cable artists all, but after all
the pre-publicity (this year is
the club's silver anniversary)
and admission £4 a head at
student rate, I expected a little
more than jazz repetoire I had
heard a year ago. A week at
the club had begun to jade the
musicians who were given
precious little time to warm
up, playing two sets rather
than the usual three. Still the
evening produced fine alto-
ballad from Harrison—though
you had to get in early to see
it—and some tight relievedly
unobtrusive drum work by
Blakey, if a little uninspiring at
times.
• It would appear Ronnie
seems to have taken an
aversion to us 'young people'.
His house magazine, issued
free on entry, delights in
praising the merits of 'the
veterans' whilst backhandedly
taking out the young people
he's supposedly trying to
e n c o u r a g e . After B B C 2 ' s
showing of 'The Long Night of
Lady Day', about the tragic life
of Billie Holiday, Scott was
pleased to report a total sell-
out of all Billie's material at
Rag's Jazz Shop, Seven Dials:
'It shows, doesn't it' he said,
'That the media could play an
i m p o r t a n t r o l e in J a z z
particularly among young
people fed on a sustained diet
of rock and roll. But our music
remains the Cinderalla of TV
and radio'. For a man with his
finger on the world of jazz,
that's a pretty introverted
thing to say. Take a walk down
to the soul-clubs, Ronnie;
learn a thing or two: and ask
your friend Ray just who
bought all those Billie Holiday
records. Attitudes such as
these will kill off the Jazz
Revival before it has even had
time to put a horn to its lips.
• N o t so the blues. Norman
J e w i s o n ' s latest film, 'A
Soldiers's Story' has taken off
in the States (it has been
nominated for Best Film, in
the forthcoming Oscars long
before release over here), but
may well sink without a trace
in Britain despite widespread
SINGLES
David Lee Roth: California
Girls
Van Helen's Rocker has
given a remarkably faithful
reproduction of this Beach
Boys classic, but with an '80's
style production, and superb 'I
dig those guuurlls' cries I
think this could have at least
as much success over here as
it has in the states (currently
no 8).
Stranglers: Let me Down Easy
Taken from the excellent
Aural Sculpture album, this is
perhaps a surprising choice
for a single, Overly moody, the
'Men in Black' get more
o p a q u e with every new
release. They go to an awful
lot of trouble to basically say
'I am knackered'.
Prince and the Revolution:
Let's Go Grazy
Ol' Prance has been getting
a lot of stick recently. Yes he's
a prat. Yes, he's selfish. Yes,
he's hyped. But—he makes
great music. From the Purple
press publicity. The film is
b a s e d on a three day
investigation by Washington
Military Police into the murder
of a black U S officer in an
army training camp in the mid
West. It is an exceptionally
well structured film, building
suspense perfectly and using
dated theatrical production
t e c h i q u e s to p r o v i d e a
nostalgic fifties ambience to
the movie. The real strength,
h o w e v e r , lies in H e r b i e
Hancock's blues soundtrack
threading" the whole movie
together. Ignore the overclubs
and the mimed lyrics, lie back
and enjoy it for the cotton-
picking blues it is.
• O n the fearsome side of
funk, Radio London's latest
venture was to team up with
C B S to provide a mammouth
concert at the Hammersmith
Odeon called the New York
J a z z E x p l o s i o n , ( T o m
Browne, Jean Craig, Lonnie
Liston Smith and xylophonist
and M C Roy Ayers.). Those
unlucky people who missed
the Saturday set (the concert
Rain soundtrack this has a
great rock feel but is still
intelligible. Watch for the
amazing guitar break at the
end. Brilliance!
Matt Bianco: More Than I Can
Bear
Beautifully relaxed remix
with lots of 'Ooohs and
Aaaahs in the background. I
love this band and find it very
difficult to slag them off—and
I have to admit this is equally
as good as any of their
previous hits—jazz-funk—
soul—pop crossover. I still
wish they'd do something new
though.
The Firm: Radiactive
The pressure on me to give
this a good review is well out
of order. Jimmy Page fans get
very overprotective. It's O K I
guess but a little bland for my
t a s t e . W i t h s u c h g r e a t
musicians you'd think they'd
at least produce a good rock
single instead of a cheap Asia
imitation. Sorry guys!
sound upat11.30pmafterfour
hours on stage) could catch
the live broadcast on Sunday,
during which entrepreneur
and funk-fool, Tony Black-
burn was actually booed off
stage whilst closing down
T o m B r o w n e ' s first set.
Browne himself was luke-
warm to begin with, playing
only short bursts of flugel
horn over Smith's reserved
keyboard work. But of course
there was Ayers. After an
e x c e l l e n t s e t b y t h e
uncredited vocalist Duboie
Jackson, he played three cuts'
from his new LP, 'In the Dark',
before closing the show with
some old work from Jean
C r a i g , a f l a g g e d a n d
flamboyant wailer wearing
one of those glittery dresses
made out of millions of
s c r e w e d u p c h o c o l a t e
wrappers. If Ayers led the
show, she led the crowd (by
the nose). T h i s was an
explosive evening, something
London rarely sees; lets's
hope there are many more to
come.
