Fantasy Famine
The TV announcer shuffled his papers. 'And
now we move to the power cut areas.
Tonight, from 10.00pm to 6.00am, there will
be power downs in the South-West, East,
North-East and Central Zones'. He moved to
a different sheet of paper and continued.
'The remaining Northern, Western and
Southern zones will have reduced voltage.
And now back to the headlines. Rioting
continues tonight in North London,
Liverpool and parts of Manchester. It is
thought that recent food shortage, due to
transport difficulties, sparked off the
violence.
'The Carbon-dioxide bubble off the
Shetlands continues to threaten to move
inland; emergency oxygen supplies have
been issued to 30% of the population.
'Estimated deaths due to famine this year
in Africa, Asia, Central and South America
today rose to over 100 million. The
Communist Block countries refuse to
release details on how this years global crop
failure has affected them, though it is thought
that they are suffering severe problems with
food supplies.
Finally, scientists reported today that the
crop failures were probably due to high levels
of dust and ash in the atmosphere. The
abnormally high amounts of atmospheric ash
recorded recently hae been attributed to the
increased use of Biomass power around the
world'. Click. Best to leave the damn thing
off, I thought, nothing but bad news
anymore. Rioting in Birmingham—rubbish.
Might as well go for a walk before the power
down.
I got my hat and coat from the wall, and,
just in case, took down my smog-respirator.
C 0 2 readings were up twelve points today. I
locked the door and took the stairs to ground
level, the lift was probably already turned off.
I left the flats and walked past the smoke
blackened walls of the nearby buildings
towards the park. Not that it was much of a
park anymore. As with free land everywhere,
after the crop failure it had been turned
either into Biomass production or food land.
The different sections made a spectacle, the
browned—off stunted wheat, or the decrepit
willow scrub. Nothing was growing properly.
The main problem, apart from the
permanantly shrouded sun, was that since
last years failure they didn't have enough
power to produce fertilizers. What with that
and the petrol shortage I'd be surprised if
things ever got going again. The government,
as usual, was putting on a brave face and
twiddling its thumbs, hoping it would all get
better. Well this time they're wrong, I
thought, not a bang but a wimper. Our fate
was really sealed when they shut all the
nukes even after the 3-mile-Island
meltdown...
No more gloom and despondancy, help is
at hand in the form of SF SOC's own
convention Picocon. Twelve hours of fun,
films and frolics on Saturday 9 March.
Featured are famous guest speakers, feature
films (mostly, but not all, science fiction), and
the renowned SFSoc games. Who are
PPSoc and will they come out of the closet to
play Call My Bluff at Picocon? This and many
more questions will be answered
somewhere, sometime, somehow (I hope).
PS 2001 coming soon (plus the 2010 trip).

"The March afternoon, judged at the window, had blundered back into autumn; it had
been raining for hours, and the colour of the rain, the colour of the air. of the mud, of the
opposite houses, of life altogether, in so grim a joke, so idiotic a masquerade, was an
unutterable dirty brown'.
