QMC revenge
Students from Queen Mary
College immobilized an IC
Union minibus last Wednesday
as revenge for the violation of
their mascot, Mary, by RCSU.
The two back wheels of the
yellow transit van were removed
and replaced by lumps of
concrete, the rotor arm was
removed and one of the front
tyres was deflated. The words
'We want Mary back' were
sprayed in foam on the side of the
minibus.
The IC Union Executive have
reacted strongly describing the
act as pure vandalism. Deputy
President, Dave Parry is
considering calling in the police,
as minibuses are not violate
mascots.
The Industrial Society used the
minibus to transport a team to
compete in a business quiz at
QMC. They parked it within the
grounds of the College and found
it immobilized on their return.
They managed to locate the
President of QMC Union who
appeared to be more interested in
a football match and couldn't
care less about the IC students'
problems. The team left the
minibus where it was and
obtained a lift to College from
one of the other teams.

Indsoc
win
The Imperial College Industrial
Society last Wednesday won the
London Regional Heat of the
prestigious Lloyds Bank
Business Quiz. They will go on to
take part in the National Finals
to be held at IC on March 13. The
team, Tim Bird, Caroline Foers
(both Mech Eng 3) and Gareth
Rowles (Physics 2) beat nine
other student Industrial Societies
from Universities as far apart as
Cambridge and Surrey.
No-one was more astonished
at the victory than the team
members themselves, since the
Imnperial team has always
previously been eliminated in the
first round, and a number of the
opposition teams were entirely
composed of business studies
students.
In the opening round, when,
the teams play off against one
another in pairs, Imperial
thrashed Sussex 45-8, but even
more satisfaction was gained
from seeing Cambridge go down
to a scratch Westfull College
team. As Imperial was one of the
four top-scorers, the team went
on to the semi-finals drawn
against Royal Holloway College
and after a nail-biting contest the
scores were level. In the tie-
breaker, IC answered correctly
and went through to the final
round.
This remarkable evening
concluded when the mighty
Ealing College team was beaten
52-49 in another close match.
IC will now go on to compete
agaisnt the teams who won the
other regional heats for the
Lloyd's Bank trophy.
