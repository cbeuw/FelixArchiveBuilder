After months of planning, the JCR exhibition Teen 2000
was opened by the Prime Minister on Wednesday.
With one full day of Tech 2000 left, FELIX takes a look at
just a few of the more interesting and unusual exhibits.
Electrical Engineering
Skeletal maturity from X-rays A
system has been developed to assist
physicians in treating growth related
disorders by analysing X-rays and
relating them to the skeletal maturity
of the patient. The system identifies
each bone in a digitised X-ray and
makes a maturity assessment based
on the maturity of the individual
bones.
Very large scale integration
The three exhibits on this topic
illustrate its importance. VLSI
i n v o l v e s g e t t i n g m i l l i o n s of
transistors on a chip. Design on this
sub-micron scale is so complex that
computers are used to assist.
Computing
British Nationality Act
When faced with legislation as
complex as the British Nationality
Act, a computer program is the
obvious answer. Work is being done
in expressing the Act as a program in
logic which can be 'interrogated' to
determine its application in a
particular case.
Heart disease
A total contrast is the use of
computers to detect heart disease
early. Signal processing technology
can be used to resolve the complex
patterns of body surface electro-
cardiograms.
Kobler Unit
Most robots are blind. The 'Wisard'
image recognition system seeks to
put this right. The device on display
can distinguish between a smile and
frown on the person sitting in front its
camera.
Aeronautical Engineering
Wind tunnel
Increasing fuel costs make the
aerodynamics of vehicle design
much more important. A new wind
tunnel, specifically designed for
testing road vehicles, has just been
completed in the Aero Department.
The test section measures 5 x 10x30
feet and the tunnel is controlled by a
dedicated computer which also
processes the results.
Mechanical Engineering
Design engineering
The Mech Eng department runs a
joint p o s t g r a d u a t e c o u r s e in
industrial design with the Royal
College of Art. The fruit of one
student's work is illustrated in the
covered motorcycle.
Artificial joints
T h e b i o n i c s s e c t i o n of t h e
department is busy developing
artificial joints, ligaments and
tendons. The exhibits outline the
progress of an elbow joint project.
