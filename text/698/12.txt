QJ
Bilge
When faced with yet another Q T article
many people ask themselves vital questions.
1 Who writes this bilge?
2 Why do I keep reading it?
3 Who won the cup in 1911?
Today we attempt to answer these and
other important queries.
This high-quality text is written by a lone
adventuerer somewhere in IC. He then
presents the text to a lowly man, who claims
to be Q T secretary, who reads it to the
assembled committee. Such has been the
violence at these gatherings that the
secretary uses a bodyguard to protect
himself and the precious text.
The photo shows the reaction to last
week's article where the bodyguard, in the
form of QT's Publicity officer (newly released
from the Scrubs) was forced to draw his
loaded water-pistol to quell the crowd's
reaction. The look of sheer horror can be
seen as the secretary prepares to deliver the
immortal line 'the room subsided into the
basement'. (Bradford City won the Cup in
1911â€”ED).
As a follow up to the amazingly successful
'St Valentines Day Comedy Massacre' Q T is
proud to present, in association with J Soc,
'Not the St Valentines Day Comedy
Massacre'.
This show stars two stand up comdians.
Firstly, Arnold Brown, a founder member of
'Comic Strip' with many T V appearances
including 'The Young Ones'.
Secondly, Ivor Dembina, part of a long
tradition of Jewish comedians: Groucho
Marx, Woody Allen and Sir Keith Joseph. If
he becomes famous he promises not to end
up obnoxious like Mel Brooks. He points out
that there are more Jewish comedians in
New York alone than in the whole of Biggin
Hill.
This event is to be held on Thursday 7
March in Physics Lecture Theatre 1.
Admission is 30p for members and 50p for
non-members, with free Q T membership
