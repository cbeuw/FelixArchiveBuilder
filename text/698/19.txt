It's amazing what an effect a
centenary can have. You may
have noticed how minor repairs,
left undone for years, have
suddenly taken on a new
importance. Loose tiles, cracked
panes, peeling paint, have all
been spruced up in time for the
celebrations. In Electrical
Engineering half of a laboratory
was repainted because it was to
house a demonstration.
Apparently there wasn't enough
money to repaint the whole
room. Unfortunately no-one told
the organisers of the demon-
stration, who subsequently set it
up in the wrong half of the lab!
Some of you may have read the
five page feature on 'City and
Guilds at Imperial College' in
Wednesday's Times. The report
highlighted none of the problems
the College faces, and must leave
the average reader thinking that a
cut of 17% in income has left the
College not only unscathed but
facing the future with renewed
vigour and optimism.
The section on student
activities was particularly
amusing since the writer had
clearly failed to grasp the
relationship between IC Union
and Guilds Union, and gives the
impression that most students
spend time worrying about Bo
and Spanner and Bolt. We are
told that having the RCM next
door means 'there is no feeling of
deprivation about the lack of an
arts faculty', that Guilds Union is
not in the NUS, and that
'Students feel part of an
intellectual elite. They chose to
apply to Imperial because they
believed it to be the best, and
have not been disappointed'.
Really, who writes this crap!
