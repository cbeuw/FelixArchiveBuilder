I thought of this fortnights puzzle only last week whilst passing
the time with my Rubiks cube.
Such a cube, with six 'complete' sides, (sides which show
only one colour), has it's Red side opposite its Orange side. The
other sides are White, Blue, Green and Yellow. It has been
manually dissassembled and put back in the configuration
depicted below.
Draw the cube as seen from the opposite direction given that
now only one side is 'complete'.
There are eight trivially different solutions, you need only
quote one of them. The puzzle can be solved without using trial
and error, and requires no knowledge of a real Rubiks cube.

The solution to last weeks puzzle was 'George, whereas
Jason had had 'had', had had 'had had', 'had had' had had the
teachers approval. There was only one correct solution, from
Jeremy Smith of Physics 3. He was randomly chosen from the
hat and may collect his £5 cheque from the FELIX Office after
Wednesday.
Just to remind everyone of the grading system here are the
definitions.
