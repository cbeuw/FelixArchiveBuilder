New refectory proposal unveiled
College officials are considering
proposals to alter the refectory
system to be funded by up to Â£'/2
million of loan finance.
A firm of consultants, Trican,
were called in last year, and came
up with a detailed plan on
Monday. This proposal is at the
moment very tentative.
Under the new system all food
service is concentrated on level 2
of the Sherfield Building. Staff
and students will enter a central
food hall from the walkway.
There they will have the choice of
a fast take-away counter, a grill
bar, and a full meal service. On
leaving the food hall, students
will go to the junior dining room
(the present JCR), while staff will
go to their own dining room,
although there are proposals to
desegregate the staff and student
eating areas.
On level 1 of the Sherfield
Building the existing main dining
room will be divided up to form a
smaller dining room and a new
JCR, with purpose built bar.
Access to the new JCR will be
from the Queens Lawn area. New
toilets will be built to service the
JCR.

Under the new proposals all
cooking will be done at the place
of service. Raw food will be
prepared on level 1 and then
taken to the food hall for final
cooking and serving.
Refectory committee Chair-
man Dr Simon Perry said that he
hoped that the new system would
lead to a vast improvement in the
quality of food served.
'There are two or three
potential major problems with
the scheme. Even if everyone
agrees to it, we may not be able to
raise the funds required' he said.
The major objections likely to
come from students is that the
new JCR may not be satisfactory
for the same sort of events as the
existing room. In particular
Commemoration Day Ball and
The Mines Ball require the use of
the entire second level. This may
not be possible under the new
scheme.
The Union have been in on
discussions on the proposals for
some time. Union President Ian
Bull is to hold an open meeting
for all students to discuss the
proposals, and make known any
objections. The meeting will be at
1.00pm on Friday 1 March in the
Union SCR.
