ROWING
Last weekend was another
successful one for Imperial
College Boat Club. The novice-
ranked squad, fresh from their
recent sudccess at Henly Fours
Head (see FELIX passed)
entered both the Fours and the
Eights division at the Burway
Head. In the morning's race, two
Fours gained a first and a fourth
placing n the Novice category,
the first placed crew winning a
set of new oars for their club
(worth £400) which were
donated by a local manufac-
tuerer More pleasing still was the
absolute placing of their crew,
whose time was faster than that
of any in the three senior classes,
being beaten only by (some) of
the Elite crews presnt.
For the afternoon's race this
winning crew doubled up with
four fresh oarsmen to contest
the Eights division, where they
completed the double by wining
the Novice shield. The overall
placing was again pleasing,
allowing international coach Bill
Mason a wide choice of
vanquished senior oarsmen with
whom to discuss the result.
Elsewhere, Imperial's own
senior crew gained a notable
victory when they won
the—University of London Head
race hy 0.04 seconds. This was
particularly creditable since the
second placed crew, Charing
Cross Hospital, had conceded
no more than a length when
beaten by the Novice squad in
the Allom Cup last- term. Keep
telling us Bill—it seems to work!

TABLE TENNIS
The interhall tabletennis
tournament resumed in style on
Saturday 16 February, with the
top three seeds of each of the five
participating halls eager to
uncover their astonishing skills.
Falmouth's recovery from the
bottom position deserves a
special mention. Aided by the
stunning performances of G
Cant and N Ting, who won all
four of their respective matches,
Falmouth managed to amass a
total of 42 points, enough to put
them ahead of Selkirk and a
whisker before Garden hall.
Only Lam Fung of Linstead came
any close to beating G Cant who,
incidentally, is also the current
IC no 1!
Linstead, however, inspite of
their brave fight for the
championship, managed to lose
their top position to the Weeks
hall.
Talking about Weeks, two of
their lethal players, O Davis and
S Mansour, did particularly well
to break a number of balls. As
one spectator aptly put it 'You
will have done well if you could
see the ball, let alone stop their
smashes'.
It is hard to pick out the man of
the tournament since there are
several top players in the same
position. All Selkirk players,
however, have shown every bit
of their social responsibility by
actively participating in the
tournament,' without a table
being available in their hall for the
practice.
Special thanks to A Warren
(Weeks), J Downes (Selkirk), M
Thompson (Falmouth), S Sadig
(Garden), V Ibbotson (Physics
1), and E George(Computing 1)
for their valuable help in the
organisation of this sxciting
tournament.
HOCKEY
Sunday found a largely
inexperienced and experimental
side travelling down to
Portsmouth for an indoor
tournament and finding itselves
in the tougher of the two groups.
Our first opposition were
Fareham, national indoor finalist
and eventual winners of the
competition, and although they
found it difficult to penetrate our
defense at short corners was far
too well drilled and ended up
comfortable winners. The
second game, vs Camberly, was
disastrous and very little need be
said about that game our third
games, vs OPCS saw- some
resembalance of organisation
return to the team, with IC
unlucky not to win the game,
since OPCS equalised in the last
minute and IC missing a penalty
flick, The game against the hosts
team, our fourth game was a low
scoring, hard fought game with
again IC unlucky not to come out
victors. This non-winning streak
was at last reversed against
Pierelli who found our quickly
improving attack too much to
cope with. McKormick (2),
Craston (1) and Oliver (2) gave
IC an comfortable 5—2 victory.
Our final game, vs OE's was a
very entertaining game, The
opposition required 8 goals to
qualify and thus the game turned
out to be good humoured and
enjoyable. Stewart scored from a
shot corner and had another
disallowed, whilst Dubenski was
at the centre of the most amusing
incident of the afternoon when
he was sent diving in an attempt
to make a hand stop at a short
corner.
The team thus finished fourth
out of seven in their group in an
event that could be seen as very
useful experience since the UAU
indoor championships are
rapidly approaching.
CROSS
COUNTRY
The 37th annual Hyde Park
Relay, hosted by the Cross-
country Club, took place in
Hyde Park on Saturday. The
warm weather made the race
enjoyable for the spectators, but
some of the runners had
difficulty finding their way
through the crowds. Predicably,
Loughborough Students won
the six-man three-mile race for
the fourth time in five years.
London Univerisity were eighth,
with Imperial's Graham Harker
running his lap in 14:41, but
Imperial College's own team
finished well down the field. The
Ladies' race saw West London
Institute hold off Loughborough
for the team race, with London
sixth. After the race Kelvin
Acford and Clare Willson pulled
off their five-loaves-and-two-
fishes trick, and succeeded in
feeding the hungry masses
thanks to all those who helped
with the race.
