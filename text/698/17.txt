3rd XI Hockey vs National
Physics Laboratories
Once again it was left to the 3rd
XI to save the honour of IC
Hockey, with our 3—1 victory
over NPL being the only hockey
victory last weekend. The game
started scrappily and it appeared
that most of our team had not
defrosted enough after the big
freeze. NPL took full advantage
of our frigidity and after about 10
minutes managed to score after a
scramble on our line during
which numerous offences were
committed but all went
unpunished. This indignity
managed to thaw the team out
and a swift counter attack was
launched, with Dick Wellis
managing to put the ball in the
net after another scramble on
the goal line. NPL were now
subdued although it still proved
difficult to get through their
defence (mainly because of its
sheer size), but Dick Ellis
managed to get a neat touch on a
ball across the face of the goal to
put us 2—1 up at half time.
In the second half IC's game
was much more fluid (ie
unfrozen) although the defence
remained solid, thanks to Capt
Chris Harris. The game was
fairly even throughout most of
this half with few scoring chances
for either side.
The last goal come from Dave
Gott who picked the ball up on
the halfway line and ran the ball
past all of the NPL defence (and
one or two IC forwards)
knocking the ball in having
comprehensively beaten the
goalie. This proved to be the only
legal goal of the whole match.
Biggest disappointment of the
day was Vernon being unable to
break his fifth stick this season
(better luck next week) and Sgt
Pepper who, inspite of a new pair
of boots could not bring his
footballing skills to the fore.
The team: Chris Harris, Per
Dullforce, Ian Mace, Steve
Brooker, Vernon Morris, Dave
Gott, Richard (Droopus) Ellis,
Scott Fraser. Special Guest
Stars: Jonathan West, James
Ward.
