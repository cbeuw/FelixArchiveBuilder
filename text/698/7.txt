Extraction of metals
A new process has been developed
for extracting metals from dilute
aqueous solutions. Rather than
u s i n g c o n v e n t i o n a l s o l v e n t
extraction, the solution is passed
through a liquid membrane. This
leads to a higher concentration of
extract. The technique has obvious
a p p l i c a t i o n s in w a s t e w a t e r
treatment, and also has biomedical
uses.
Particle size distribution
How big are the droplets in an
aerosol spray? Using a new laser
technique the Chem Eng department
have been able to find out. The
aerosol is sprayed into one end of the
apparatus—and a plot of the particle
size distribution appears at the other
end.
Civil Engineering
Feed the world
International and UK relief agencies
have many problems in providing
safe water supplies as quickly as
possible in emergency situations. To
assist with this problem, Oxfam and
Imperial College have collaborated
on a project to research, design and
develop a series of water packs.
These comprise equipment and
materials in standard package form
for easy transport to, and rapid
installation at, the required location.
During the current relief operation in
Ethiopia, Oxfam have used many of
the packs.
Sewers
Fed up with having to replace your
worn-out sewers? According to Civ
Eng this is an expensive and
disruptive operation. The depart-
ment is working on developing
methods for renovating sewers
instead.

world's most boring student by Finian
Y'know, before I was
sent to University
Mummy made me
promise her I wouldn't
get an overdraft.
'Just lie on your bed and keep very
still if you can't afford to go out' she
said.
'You musn't live
outside your means'
she said.
I think it's about time for a little chat
with my bank manager.
