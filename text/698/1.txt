The Prime Minister, Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, was at
College on Wednesday to open
Tech 2000, the exhibition to
mark 100 years of the City and
Guilds College.
Mrs Thatcher arrived at
about 5.30pm amid tight
security, and was met in the
foyer of the Sherfield Building
by the Rector, Lord Flowers,
and the Dean of City and
Guilds, Professor Sayers.
She was also introduced to
Maribel Anderson, Guilds
President, before going on to
open the exhibition in the JCR.
About 150 demonstators
protested against Mrs
Thatcher's visit, shouting
'Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.
Out, out, out'. The demon-
strators were against the
education cuts introduced by
Mrs Thatcher's government.
Over 600 guests attended the
Centenary Banquet held at the
Guildhall on Tuesday.
The guest of honour was
HRH Prince Phillip, the Duke
of E d i n b u r g h . Other
distinguished guests included
the Lord Mayor, Masters of
livery companies, MPs and
senior civil servants.
The Duke's speech, and that
of the Dean, Professor Sayers,
were well received. The evening
ended with a resouding
Boomalaka called by Guilds
President Maribel Anderson.
