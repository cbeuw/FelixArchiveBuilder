SPORTS FELIX
On a cold but pleasant
afternoon in November it
was said that some IC stu-
dents went down to Putney
to watch a boat race or
two, and now even three.
Morphy Day proved to be
However the good, con-
stant rowing of Mines over-
came the good start of
Guilds to win by three
lengths, R.C.S. ploughed
home a gallant third! (The
idea of this race was to en-
different in general aspects
this year—the absence of
the towpath battle, the in-
novation of a third race
and the christening of the
new boat by Lady Penny.
The innovation of the
year must have been the
race between the "rugger-
eights". After practising
only in the tank, three
crews of non-oarsmen per-
formed creditably in their
first outing. Over the half-
mile course there was an
excellent strugggle be-
tween Mines and Guilds.
courage maximum use of
our facilities anywhere and
create more interest in
constituent college con-
tests?).
In the Lowry Race there
was probably the best race
for first place. Guilds and
R.C.S. were in strong con-
tention for the whole race
and only in the final 400
metres did Guilds manage
to draw away and win by
one length. The hard-
working Mines crew was
left in the wake of this tre-
mendous struggle between
Guilds and R.C.S.
In the Morphy Race the
suggestion that the condi-
tions favoured the power-
ful Guilds crew proved to
be correct. From the start
the Guilds left the Mines
and R.C.S. boats in an ex-
citing and excellent race
for second place. Through
Putney Bridge there was
nothing to choose between
these two crews with
Guilds well ahead. At the
Boathouse the Guilds won
by three lengths and
R.C.S. had managed to
creep ahead by a third of
a length from the Mines.
Under the expert guid-
ance of the Umpire Tom
Sutton, the races were
started smoothly and with-
out incident — even the
rugger-eights. The three
events provided the con-
stituent college conting-
ents with some exciting
and excellent races—con-
gratulations to all crews,
especially the rugger-
eights.
In the gathering gloom
of the evening Lady Penny
christened the new shell
cox four in the traditional
manner. May the Boat
Club thank both the Rector
and Lady Penny for attend-
ing Morphy Day.
HOCKEY
Saturday, 30th October.
On Saturday IC trekked
out to Shenley for their
match against UC. Unfor-
tunately both teams were
one player short, which
never marred an exciting
and hard game. Both teams
elected to be one toward
less, and consequently the
remaining attack became
even more determined. IC
began a little shakily, being
lucky not to have conced-
ed a goal in the first
minute, but soon rallied
despite UC actually scor-
ing early in the second
half. The equaliser came
soon afterwards and the
match seemed destined
for a 1-1 draw. However in
the last minute of the
match with one IC player
almost passing-out (?!)
from a severe clout with a
hockey stick UC forced
the ball into the net and so
took the game to 2-1. How-
ever the result could have
easily been reversed and
on the whole IC put up a
very creditable perform-
ance.

Yet again another liter-
ary masterpiece from your
roving reporter giving you,
the general public, all the
information as to how the
first rugby team are pro-
gressing. The team has
been going through an in-
different phase in the sea-
son having lost 4 of the
last 6 matches. These
were: Rosslyn Park Stags
(8-13), UC (8-12), Bedford
Wanderers (3—14) and
Twickenham (13-17); the
other two were victories
against Ealing Tech. (14—
3), L.S.E. (12—9). Some
of the matches are des-
cribed in detail below
(how boring—Sec).
Against Bedford Wander-
ers on Saturday, 6th Nov-
ember, after a riotous (?)
bonfire night at Harlington,
l.C. 1st XV turned in a
superb performance to
hold the second team of
possibly the best club in
the Midlands to a 3—14
defeat. I.C. were under in-
tense pressure for most of
the game, since the Bed-
ford attack dominated all
the possession by their
sheer physical size. How-
ever, l.C. defended their
line superbly well after suf-
fering the setback of an
early try by the Bedford
three-quarters. After some-
body cocked up a penalty
kick in front of the posts
(I wonder who??) Bedford
went further ahead with a
breakaway try. So the half-
time score was 8-0 in Bed-
ford's favour. I.C., in the
second half, were playing
in the wind and slope and
although went 14 points
down early on, came back
into the game more and
more as time went by,
coming very close to scor-
ing (especially McDon-
ough, after a wonderful 30-
yard touchline run, only to
be caught by the cover a
few yards short) on sever-
al occasions. However,
Bedford held out and Jam-
es kicked a penalty goal
right on time to bring the
score to 3—14.
Team: J. Hughes; J. Mc-
Donough; B. Baines; D.
Osborne; P. Loftus; A.
James (Capt.); C. Flana-
gan; M. Sugrue; H. Mich-
ael; C. Wrigley; C. Humph-
ries; R. Matthews; A. Teb-
bett; I. Partridge; T. Mor-
ris.
On Sunday, 7th Novem-
ber IC played Twickenham
in the second round of the
Middlesex knockout cup
and were defeated by 17-13.
Electing to play in strong
wind in the first half IC
were soon in the lead with
a penalty from James. IC
increased their lead to 9
points when Hughes made
an entry (?) into the line
to send McDonough over
in the corner—the try be-
ing converted by (what's
his name?). IC thus turned
round and faced the stiff
breeze and found them-
selves level when Twicken-
ham scored a penalty and
a converted try. Twicken-
ham went further into the
lead after a scrummage
when their scrum half
picked up to score. 13—9
down, lC came back
strongly with much vocal
support from the soccer
fans (?) of the student
houses and were rewarded
with a try right on time
when from a short penalty
Tebbett took the ball on
the burst to hand on to
James who scored near
the post. He did however,
manage to b - - - r up the
kick and so the game went
to extra time with Twicken-
ham scoring first to clinch
the game.
Team: with-held for se-
curity reasons, but known
to consist of 15 players.
Final bit of bullshit com-
ing up. This Wednesday
(or last Wednesday, de-
pending on when you read
this), anyway 10th Novem-
ber, IC played LSE and
were victorious by 12—9.
LSE won the toss and de-
cided to play into the wind.
IC had to defend for the
first few minutes but they
soon came back into the
game. IC opened the scor-
ing when from a misdirect-
ed relieving kick from the
LSE defence the ball went
to full back J. Hughes who
dropped a 40 yard goal,
much to the embarrass-
ment of someone who
shall remain nameless. Af-
ter a period of heavy pres-
sure IC went further ahead
when Pilkington picked up
a kick from James to send
McDonough over in the
corner (again!). This try
was superbly converted
from the touchline by
(you've all guessed wrong-
ly;) P. Earl making a guest
appearance for the first
team. So IC turned round
with a 9 point lead. This
was eventually whittled
down by LSE who drew
level, although in fact the
IC team had been doing
most of the attacking in
the second half. It was left
to the magical boot of Earl
to give IC a deserved vic-
tory.
Team: J. Hughes; J. Mc-
Donough; P. Pilkington; D.
Osborne; P. Lofts; A.
James (capt.); C. Flana-
gan; M. Sugrue; P. Earl;
C. Wrigley; C. Humphries;
R. Matthews; I. Rhys; I.
Partridge; A. Tebbett.
LATE FLASH
Hew Michael, celebrated
Captain of Vice of IC Rug-
by Club wants it made
known that he actually
scored another try, against
Ealing Tech. some time
ago. This must be some
sort of record since he al-
so scored against Avery
Hill to make a grand total
of two for the season so
far. Well done Hew!!
EDITORIAL
The proposed Govern-
ment's reforms on Student
Unions, will, if they are
implemented, certainly
curtail the present free-
dom that students have in
the financing of their acti-
vities The threat is that
students in future will have
no control on the amount
of money that the College
(i.e. the Government) giv-
es for student use and
there is also the possibility
that students will no lon-
ger have any say in how it
is spent.
With respect to sports
clubs within IC, a grant is
received from the general
Union funds which is ably
managed by the Athletics
clubs committees and ex-
ternally audited. This is
then divided amongst indi-
vidual clubs to subsidise
equipment, stationery and
entertainment of visitors.
In the proposals there is
no provision for any such
grant aid; in fact they
specifically state that clubs
finances must be found
totally from the member-
ship or fund raising events
which will mean that the
cost of sports to the indi-
vidual student will rise
quite dramatically.
Those clubs with expen-
sive equipment may even
have to cease their activi-
ties whilst even the popu-
lar and co-called "cheap"
sports will find member-
ship hard to come by when
we can visualise the clubs
being composed of only a
hard core of enthusiasts.
The student who plays his
sport mainly for enjoyment
will not be able to afford
the increased subscription
and consequently the cost
will be even higher for
those who can pay. Clubs
will also not be able to
plan in advance because
they will be unsure, year
by year, exactly what this
total budget will be.
It is the policy of ACC
to make sporting facilities
easily available to all stu-
dents and it would be a
disaster if the present sys-
tem in Universities which
allow students to be intro-
duced to new sports, many
of which they would be
unable to take advantage
of outside college, would
fall apart completely; the
student would only be able
to do as little as he can
afford.
The Union, at its EGM,
was almost unanimous in
condemning these propos-
als and has supported the
London College's march
on Wednesday, 17th Nov-
ember, and it was hoped
that all sports fixtures
could be cancelled so that
all members of the teams
could attend.
For notice of further ac-
tion that is to be taken,
then the Union meetings
should be attended when
the latest information on
the situation will be made
available.

Mr. W. Beauford, Chair-
man of ACC, has recently
become engaged.
1st CLASS 1st XI
KIBBUTZ
What's it all about. Stay with
us for a month or more as a
working visitor and discover
for yourself. Scheme for the
young 18-30. Apply now for
details to the Kibbutz repre-
sentative, 4-12 Regent Street,
London SW1. Please enclose
fair size s.a.e. 01-930 5151 X333.
We are now over half
way through the Autumn
Term and IC soccer teams
continue to beat the best.
Both the first and second
Xl's are still unbeaten.
It has been said many
times before that to have
a successful first team a
club must have a strong
second team, this certain-
ly applies at IC, and our
second team is good and
skilful as many other Col-
lege first teams, and most
of the present second team
have at some time played
for the first and equip
themselves extremely well.
In fact, last Wednesday
Bill Pyke made his debut
for the first XI and scored
a hat-trick in a 4—1 win
over UC—a fine perform-
ance. With potential of this
calibre lurking in an ex-
ceptional 2nd XI, the first
XI players have to put
everything into their game
to secure their place, and
with a more difficult fix-
ture programme in the sec-
ond half of this term, the
1st XI will have to pull out
all the stops to maintain
their good start to the sea-
son.
As well as the fixture
programme, the IC team
will also have their sights
set on the first round
proper of the ULU cups on
Saturday, 4th December.
Training for this has start-
ed in earnest this week,
but at present training ses-
sions are somewhat under-
subscribed, and I cannot
emphasise enough that
training is essential to a
good Cup run, as well as
success in the league com-
petitions. However, it is
not enough just to be fit
and training sessions also
provide the opportunity for
•teams to get together more
frequently, to build a good
team and club spirit. With
this in view, we would like
to see every team member
at training on Tuesday and
Thursday lunch-times,
meeting in the Union gym
at 12.30.
1st XI: N. Bakewell; M.
McGrath; R. Kill; C. Will-
cock (capt.); M. Pearson;
N. Fryer; I. Rogers; B.
Smith; B. Pyke; J. Kelly; B.
Milne.
