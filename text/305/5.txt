' F E L I X ' looks
at Beer and
Wine-making,
Longing for a drink?
Fancy a wild orgy? But
you can't afford it, can you,
not with the extortionate
bar prices (and we all
know where the profits go,
don't we folks?) and a
grant which allows for £1
pocket money per week.
Then gentle reader per-
haps it is time you started
making your own booze.
Expensive? Well, beer costs
about 3p a pint and wine
about 5p a bottle; draw
your own conclusions. Or
perhaps the idea of mak-
ing your own beer and
wine is repugnant because
it smacks of Women's In-
stitutes. In fact recipes are
regularly printed in such
groovy rags as IT and
Frendz. It requires very
little initial outlay—you've
probably got most of the
necessary materials al-
ready—and the enjoyment
you get at the end is surely
justification for the time
you put into it.
The basic materials for
winemaking are as follows:
A plastic or enamel bucket
holding at least a gallon, a
glass carboy or jar holding
a gallon (with a cork and
airlock), a length of rubber
or plastic tubing (about 3
feet), various pots and
pans, and of course bot-
tles. As for ingredients,
anything can be and is
used, ranging from the no-
risk tinned grape-juice
wines with additions of cit-
ric acid, sulphur dioxide
tablets, grape tannin and
other chemicals, to con-
coctions consisting of left-
over vegetables prepared
in traditionally repulsive
ways such as being left to
collect a thick mould. It is
true that quite palatable
wines can still be made
quite cheaply without re-
sorting to anything doubt-
ful.
These instructions are
for a fairly cheap wine with
out chemical embellish-
ment and without a mould.
Methods of preparing the
extract to be fermented, or
"must" as it is called vary
with the individual recipes
but basically, for fruit and
flower wines cut up or
break 4 lb. of fruit or a
gallon of flowers and pour
on a gallon of boiling wat-
er. Leave for about 3 days
then strain and add 4 lbs.
of sugar and a teaspoon-
ful of yeast; for vege-
tables slice about 5 lb. and
simmer in a gallon of wat-
er until tender, replacing
any water lost during the
boiling, then strain, add 4
lb. of sugar and, when the
must is cool, the yeast.
Yeast can be of any sort—
brewer's or baker's yeast
works quite well although
a wine yeast is obviously
preferable. The sweetened
yeasted juice is poured in-
to the jar until it is filled.
Any surplus is kept in a
bottle for topping up the
main bulk during fermenta-
tion. The jar is stood on a
tray in a warm room and
soon fermentation starts
and froth pours over the
sides of the container into
the tray. When froth no
longer forms, the tray is
removed, the jar cleaned
and an airlock or loosely
fitting cork is fitted. When
gas bubbles are no longer
formed, the wine is treated
as follows depending on
the type of wine required.
For dry still wines place
the jar in a cool room for
fourteen days and syphon
difficult to make except by
accident.
However carefully you
think you've made the
wine, snags do occur. The
one which bothers me
most is that wine contin-
ues to ferment after it has
been bottled even though
it looked completely dead
in the jar. There are sever-
al remedies for this; you
can bang the corks in, tie
them down and hope that
it makes a good sparkling
wine, or pour wine back in
the jar, let it ferment on
and hope you won't be
fooled again, or try steril-
ising the bottles in boiling
water. I haven't tried this
myself but I am assured it
works. Many home-made
wines won't clear and al-

off, without disturbing the
yeast deposit. The wine
can now either be bottled
and left for 6 months be-
fore sampling or alternat-
ively it can be stored in
the jar for 6 months and
then bottled for another
6 months. The advantages
of this method are that the
wine is less likely to fer-
ment in the bottle and
more likely to be clear
when drunk. For dry spark-
ling wines bottle the wine
in heavy glass (champ-
agne) bottles, add a tea-
spoonful of sugar to each
bottle before corking, and
tie the corks down tightly.
For sweet, still wines, to
each gallon of fermented
wine add f lb of sugar, stir
until dissolved, reinsert the
airlock and allow to fer-
ment once more. When
gas is no longer formed
taste the wine and if it is
not sweet add another £
lb. of sugar and referment.
This should be repeated
until the sugar remains un-
fermented. This shows that
the yeast is dead and more
sugar can be added if de-
sired without the risk of
further fermentation. Sweet
sparkling wines are very
though this has no effect
on the taste, it does seem
to detract from the aristo-
cratic feeling some
people get when sipping
their plonk. It can be av-
oided by adding a pectoly-
tic enzyme (e.g. Pecto-
zyme) to the must before
fermentation, which should
also ensure that fermenta-
tion is over fairly quickly,
or by adding wine finings
(e.g. CWS) after fermen-
tation. More serious is
when the wine picks up
mould or vinegar bacteria.
This should be prevented
by an efficient airlock but
if it does happen you might
as well throw the wine
away. Then there is the
case when everything
seems to be fine except
the wine doesn't taste
good. In that case you can
either grin and bear it or
try turning it into vermouth
by adding bitter herbs.
With a bit of luck none of
these horrors will befall
you and you will have a
wine you will be proud to
show your friends, even if
you drink it all yourself. I
should stress that wine
must take its own time and
unless you buy a grape-
extract-type wine this will
be at least nine months.
The making of beer will
probably be of more inter-
est to students because it
only takes a month at the
most to make. The major-
ity of home-made beer
comes from kits of various
sorts complete with in-
structions so it doesn't
seem necessary to repeat
them here. The equipment
required is almost the
some as that for wine-mak-
ing except that a larger
bucket may be required
and that screw-topped cid-
er bottles are much better
than corked ones. The best
of the kits is the one call-
ed "Geordie" which con-
tains a string bag of malt
and hops which is brewed
just like the real thing,
folks, other kits miss out
the brewing part and sup-
ply malt extract which just
needs to be dissolved in
water.
There are a few points
worth making which you
probably won't find in any
instructions. If you can't
find a saucepan big en-
ough to do the brewing in,
repeated dousing of the
malt and hops with boiling
water seems to work just
as well. The beer tends to
throw down a heavy depos-
it which gets into the bot-
tles when the beer is syp-
oned off, this can be par-
tially offset by syphoning
off the beer twice —
once about 3 days before
add again just before bot-
tling. There will still be
some sediment in the bot-
tom of the bottles by the
time the beer is ready, so
when opening them de-
cant carefully into a jug
before serving. And finally,
don't think you failed just
because the beer doesn't
taste exactly like Star-
bright. It's stronger for a
start.

Wide with unasked loneliness and hurt;

Immersed in sludgy gravy the "Coq au vin" arrived
And joined the cluttered cutlery
And all the token imagery
Arrayed upon the cloth
Soup plates now devoid, unseen, are hastily removed
And bare space eagerly awaits
Pure white enamel dinner plates
That fit upon the cloth
Unknown exotic veg, yes, readily paraded
But dark grey potatoes are placed
Far away that they should not waste
The talents of the cloth.
At last with winey finery the main course was served
The dinner plates were now all fulfilled
Their complacent purity killed
Sacrificed to the cloth.
'Midst undue haste starched creases have been blem-
ished
By drops of gravy I mislaid;
Strange to say fulfilment made
Sacrilege of the cloth.
