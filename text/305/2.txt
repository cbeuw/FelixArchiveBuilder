McLOOGE Expounds!
T H E W H O
One of the problems of
writing anything about a
group as popular as the
Who is that almost every-
thing has been said about
them already. In between
the times that the group
releases something new,
writers will scurry around
searching for some facet
of their music that has not
been brought to light. It
would be nice to say that
everything that the group
did when they appeared at
the Rainbow Theatre was
completely new and to de-
vote a whole paragraph to
an ambitious new opera
by Pete Townsend, per-
haps, or at least something
that hasn't yet been com-
mitted to record. Of
course this was not the
case and probably never
will be. Few groups would
dare open their show with
a song they first did seven
years ago, but the Who did
with "I Can't Explain" and
got away with it. Nothing
they did was younger than
the "Who's Next" album
and I loved it.
The Rainbow Theatre,
what used to be the Fins-
bury Park Astoria, is Lon-
don's newest and most
ambitious rock venue. It
has been heralded as the
British successor to the
now defunct Fillmore
Theatres in the States, and
is the brainchild of John
Morris, who was partly re-
sponsible for the (mis)
management of the Wood-
stock Festival and the Fill-
mores.
The resident lightshow,
Joe's Lights, has moved to
England after working at
Fillmore East in New
York. The theatre is cer-
tainly ideal for presenting
groups, holding 3,000
people, and a lot has been
spent on alterations, such
as raising the stage, to en-
hance the audiences enjoy-
ment. The view from even
the cheapest seats is per-
fect and uninterrupted, un-
like the Albert Hall where
from some seats you can't
see a thing. I hope that the
spiralling prices of top
groups do not cause the
same fate to befall the
Rainbow as happened to
the Fillmores. The only
criticism to come to light
so far is that the beer pric-
es are astronomical, but
then you can't have every-
thing.
What better way to open
the Rainbow could there
be than with the Who? The
group played there with
Quiver on November 4th,
5th and 6th, and all 9,000
tickets for the three con-
certs had sold out within
five hours.
According to reliable
sources (the group them-
selves) the Thursday night
concert was not particular-
ly successful, but on Fri-
day the Who went down a
storm. Whether they told
Saturday's audience the
same as they told us is a
matter of conjecture.
Quiver opened the show
although they were preced-
ed by a bevy of can-can
dancing girls who received
warm applause as well as
many cries of "Get em'
off". The group had im-
proved greatly since I last
saw them and now have a
flawless P.A. system. The
sound is quite country in-
fluenced and similarities to
the Grateful Dead are un-
mistakeable, particularly
during the fluent periods
of jamming featuring the
guitars of Tim Renwick
and Cal Batchelor. The
group did not get the re-
ception they deserved but
this lack of appreciation,
was I suppose, predict-
able from an audience that
came to see The Who.
They took the stage in pre-
dictable fashion, joining
the can-can dancers, and
started off at such a fan-
tastic pace that it seemed
impossible that they could
keep it up for two hours.
"I Can't Explain", "Substi-
tute", "Sumertime Blues",
"My Wife", "BabaO'Riley",
"Bargain", "Behind Blue
Eyes", a sizeable chunk
from "Tommy", "Won't
Get Fooled Again" and
"My Generation" followed
each other in rapid succes-
sion: It seems incredible
that Townsend's opera,
played continually for two
years, could still bring
such an ecstatic reaction
from the audience, unless
every one of them, like me,
had not seen the group be-
fore.
As "My Generation"
drew to a close a screen
went up behind the group
and blinding spotlights
shone on the audience—
their generation I had
never thought of the group
before as an environmen-
tal one like say, Pink
Floyd, but their light show,
working in conjunction
with Joe's Lights, was
beautifully sympathetic to
the music. And if you
thought that Keith Moon
on drums was just a show-
man and a jester, I can
now announce that he'll
wipe the floor with your
Ginger Bakers and your
Carl Palmers any day.
Everyone knows how good
Pete Townsend is as a
guitarist so I needn't men-
tion that; he was however
wearing a silver boiler suit
and did not smash his gui-
tar. There's some news for
you!
As a conclusion I shall
say that the Who are defi-
nitely the best live band in
the world but something
new would have been ap-
preciated, otherwise jour-
nalists will be losing their
jobs.

Presuming that the rest
of this paper is crammed
with news, views and
events associated with the
Government's Green Paper
(AND SO IT SHOULD BE!)
what else has been going
on?
Diversification — Your 5
reps at the Board of Stud-
ies meeting presented the
paper "Review" of First
Degree Courses at l.C.
Unfortunately the chair-
man (i.e. the Rector)
seemed to want to settle
the matter before any dis-
cussion took place. "I
think we can agree that
the Academic Director
needs to be appointed as
soon as possible, however
I feel that the former re-
commendation passed (to
approve I.C.U. policy in
diversification as college
policy) is a matter that
can't be rushed and needs
a lot of thinking about"—
thus despite a general
complete agreement en-
dorsement of the "spirit
and principles" of our sub-
mission and repeated
Union please for a deci-
sion, the Rector managed
to finish the discussion off:
"I think we can use the
minutes of the meeting as
a true record of our feel-
ings". Thus it's back to the
old slog of trying to con-
vince some departments in
the college that not every
one of their students wants
to be a super specialist.
Discipline — approxi-
mately four years ago the
college and union got to-
gether to start working out
Drring Drring, Drring
Drring,
"Good morning, Union
Office"—
Armitage answered the
phone.
"Oh!" he ejaculated.
"Perhaps you had better
speak to someone higher
up."
"Dave, would you like to
speak to someone on the
phone?"
"No" replied the weary
NUS card stamper. "Some-
one from the Granada TV"
Armitage added. "Certain-
ly!" the now not so recalci-
trant secretary shouted as
she leapt for the phone.
Perhaps that isn't exact-
ly the way things happen
when Granada Television
decided that IC had been
too long off the screen but
it is characteristic of the
way things have develop-
ed.
Last Thursday 4th Nov-
ember IC Union Office was
thronged with IQ's of
180+ (MENSA watch out)
a suitable college code of
discipline. On the morning
the green paper was pub-
lished the Rector and I fin-
ally agreed on the last
draft. Thus now the Rector
has to submit it to the
Studies and Board of
Board of Governors for ap-
proval and I have to sub-
mit it to Union Council and
a U.G.M. I believe it's a
fair document but it's also
a very important one—thus
come to the U.G.M. (18th
November, Great Hall 1.00
p.m.) and scrutinise it
closely (copies should be
available in the Union
O.S.S. (Organisation for
Office beforehand).
Community Action —
Social Service) and Com-
munity Action have got to-
gether within IC and by the
time you have read this,
we will have presented to
Union Council a draft of
their new constitution for
approval. They will be-
come a major sub-commit-
tee of the Union (like Ex-
ternal Affairs, Rag Com-
mittee) and receive fin-
ance direct from the Un-
ion. This merger fulfils 3
aims (1) To give Commun-
ity Action its rightful im-
portant place within the
Union; (2) to place it on
a more reliable financial
footing; (3) to bring to-
gether the somewhat poli-
tically oriented Commun-
ity Action people (who
basically believe the cause
of the ailment should be
removed (eg bad land-
lords etc.) and purely Soc
ial Service people (who
keep to the ailment itself.)
all fighting for the privilege
of making IC an even more
unpopular place to come
to. A quick run through 40
University Challenge ques-
tions left no doubt in our
minds—we ought to with-
draw immediately! But wily
Dave (pinball) Amos hav-
ing a quick eye for an easy
profit said "No—we keep
in 'cos the Union gets a
hundred quid".
So sometime in the fut-
ure Simon Albault, Paul
McCartney, Z. Kronberge,
M. Corney, P. Wardle get
a free trip to Manchester,
the home of Granada Tele-
vision. It is not all hard
work either, the whole
team, besides getting all
their travel and ancillary
costs reimbursed, also get
a free booze-up and hotel
for the night.
Hope and pray you don't
meet someone like New
College, Oxford, in the first
round, otherwise goodbye
fame and fortune, IC.
The team at the moment
A big membership drive
will probably start after
Christmas and close liais-
on will be maintained with
External and Academic Af-
fairs and the Rag. If you
are interested now, contact
Damion Cummins (Union
floor rep c/o Union Office
and Met P.G.) or Brian
Harris (Geophysics P.G.).
Vacation Training—Fol-
lowing the meeting of this
committee, it was decided
that a detailed analysis
should be done within
College to see if the Vaca-
tion Training Office per-
forms a function that is
wanted (a lot of people get
jobs through Depts. or
can't work for 8 or so
weeks or would rather take
manual better paid work).
Pay rates have risen well
this last year—over 55 per
cent of the jobs paid over
the Grant fare (and letters
are being sent to all those
who didn't bother to point
out this fact to them). A
lot of the work done by the
Vac. Training Board is bas-
ed on very important feed-
back—so if you want Vac.
Training this Summer and
haven't handed back your
Employee's form, please
do so as soon as possible.
Also apply early for jobs—
there are a lot now in the
office that if not filled soon
may be withdrawn. Re-
member—if you think we
are not doing our job or if
you've got any sugges-
tions—don't hesitate to
come into the Union Office
—the more the merrier.
AND LET'S SMASH THIS
GREEN PAPER!
goes into strict training, no
sex. drink, or academic
work for the next fortnight.
Each member of the team
has been chosen for his
knowledge of a specific
subject and they are all
training accordingly. One
member of the team is
locked in Queen's Tower,
where he is studying areo-
nautics by dropping large
lumps of masonry on pass-
ing students, another is
living in a Mooney kitch-
en observing flora and
fauna while another is at
Maria Assumpta watching
strange habits. The re-
mainder of the team is
avidly watching the past
230 programmes of Uni-
versity Challenge some-
where in an isolated TV
studio.
What do we get out of
it??—£100 an appearance
(i.e. £100 only) and free
coach to Manchester.
Don't miss them when
they are on—see them
crush Pamper Grassgroin!
