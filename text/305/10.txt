We've heard t h a t Ents are 'now £1.00 i n t h e red - but t h i s s i t u a t i o n i s expected
to change r a p i d l y (and perhaps f o r the b e t t e r ' ? ? ) . The main f a c t o r of t h i s l o s s

hooked f o r next term w i l l be more p r o f i t a b l e : before someone caught up w i t h

T h i s masterpiece of the d u p l i c a t o r ' s a r t , otherwise known as the 18th Nov 1971
issue, of FELICITY, was e d i t e d and produced by O i l y Dowson, w i t h Dave G r i b b l e
who helped t u r n the handle and agreed to commit s u i c i d e i n order to get the
news up to d a t e . P l e a s e n o t e : as t h i s i s o n l y the t h i r d time he has been
dug up t h i s term, we expect to see him around s h o r t l y (the ground being
r a t h e r hard i n the c o l d w e a t h e r ) . ( W e ' l l cremate him next t i m e ) . No thanks
to your very own (whose, f o r God's s a k e ? ? ? ) John S e b a s t i a n S t a r e s , who attem-
pted to cut these c r e d i t s , when t h e y ' r e about the best p a r t of the whole o f
FELIX and FELCITY put together ( j u s t because he d o e s n ' t u s u a l l y get a ment.)
P l e a s e a l s o note t h a t these c r e d i t s ( t h e r e ' s that word again) are a l s o the
e d i t o r i a l and the t o t a l s e r i o u s news content of FELICITY ( t h e r e ' s THAT word
a g a i n ) . We f e l t , a f t e r a l l , t h a t you needed some s e r i o u s news a f t e r a l l t h a t
comic rubbish on the FELIX c o v e r page's.

who by now must d i s c l a i m any r e s p o n s i b i l i t y f o r any contents contained (or not)
