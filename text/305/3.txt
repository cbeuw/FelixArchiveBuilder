E D I T O R I A L
A new leader is born and may we all rejoice!! For
the new leader was not just simply born but grew in
the style of all true leaders.
It all began with an emergency drive for economy.
Save, save and hang the cost. I speak, of course, of our
good friend Mrs. T.
Her true rise to power began, when she was appoint-
ed to lead the Department of Education and Science.
She only practised her economy drive in a small way
at first with her 'every family should keep a cow in their
back garden' campaign, and she was most unjustly
accused of penny-pinching. Shocked by these accusa-
tions, power rushed to her head and she began to
produce her master plan to save not pennies, but mil-
Ions of pounds. Indeed the whole annual higher educa-
tion bill.
The plan began with a seemingly harmless step. A
practice adopted by all the more successful business
establishments which she applied to student unions.
Giving away every facility you have, was the obvious
road to success for any business and as expected
student unions went broke and passed away quite
quickly and quietly. But wait; next came the masterly
stroke. Once student unions were removed students
don't have any entertainment and they can't fight any
further legislation. It is obvious now that as they aren't
distracted from their work they can do their degree in
two years. A brilliant idea and as nobody grumbled
(how could they without a union) two year degrees
become the thing to do.
Still, all good leaders have their Waterloo. As plan-
ned the students that haven't committed suicide have
had to leave college on mental grounds and so we have
saved the cost of all the silly universities, haven't we?
Also we've made all that money from selling the build-
ings so what's wrong? Could Mrs. T. have forgotten
that she has also a responsibility to educate people as
well as watching her budget. Complete removal from
the Department of Education and Science is the only
reward for this woman. If every student plays his part
and does everything in his power to fight this stupid
green paper, with luck she may get it.

LETTERS
M O R P H Y D A Y
Dear Sir,
Hallelujah! At last! etce-
tera.
Morphy Day was cancel-
led in all but name by the
Union Meeting on the 3th
November. Unfortunately
this was done only as a
P.R. action, we students
being told that the can-
celation was in reality just
a postponement, which (in
our opinion) is a shame.
We would really like to see
the students here waking
up to their responsibilities;
not continually pursuing
such actively destructive,
pointless and futile exerci-
ses as Morphy Day.
Let's face it, Morphy
Day and its contemporar-
ies might do more than to-
tally alienate public opin-
ion. It might even be a
factor in dear Maggie's de-
cision itself. Perhaps our
favourite government now
feels that this green paper
could now drift through
the parliamentary motions
and become law, simply
because the paper doesn't
matter to the "average
man".
"Who cares? Bloody
hooligans anyway". He
might say.
The only answer we at
I.C. could come up with for
sure is that we care. And
over this particular issue
we do. With respect, its
about time!! Students here
have been going through a
period of extreme immatur-
ity; it's about time we
GREW UP. That doesn't
mean we should all be
good boys and work, work,
work. What we should do
is try to lose our apathy,
try to become involved as
much as possible, try not
to waste our valuable non-
work time. We owe it to
ourselves, our college and
our society to do and think
something constructive.
Anything.
Sincerely,
Ian Stock
Phil Brading
Sir,
I reject the implication
published in the last edi-
tion of Felicity, that I had
not fully considered the ef-
fects of the inevitable con-
version of the City of West-
minster to Natural Gas, as
a lack of confidence in my
ability to act as a Repre-
sentative of the Union, and
to implement the decisions
of the Imperial College
Union Council, at the last
meeting of which a motion
was passed calling for the
Retention and Preservat-
ion of the Gas Street
lighting in Prince Consort
Road.
I utterly reject these im-
plications as a vile slur on
on my character and posi-
tion; I consider that my
honour has been question-
ed, leaving me little alter-
native but to call you out.
Sir, I ask you to settle
this issue in the accus-
tomed, but generally dis-
used, fashion. I refer,
should you remain in
doubt, to the ancient
science of duelling.
Naturally I leave the
choice of venue and wea-
pons to yourself: I hope
and trust that this whole
business will be settled
with the utmost speed.
I remain, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Martin C. Black
It is with deep regret
that I must inform you Mr.
Black that as the slur oh
your character, to which
you refer, appeared in Fe-
licity, I cannot accept any
responsibility for it and
can only suggest that you
take the matter up with the
editor of Felicity.
I do, however, take seri-
ous exception to the sug-
gestion that I am a man
who would lower myself to
mocking the afflicted, and
unless you, Mr. Black,
make a public apology
within the week, I, sir, shall
be forced to call you out I

Dear Sir,
As a non student reader
of FELIX I must congratu-
late you on the new for-
mat: I think it has made
the magazine more inter-
esting and has cut out a
lot of the political rubbish
that regularly appeared in
its contents.
But the main reason for
writing this is to reply to
the letter signed "Harry M.
Government". Does he not
realise there are thous-
ands of people who would
be happy to deposit their
money in ANY bank? Does
he not realise thousands

on starvation wages? Does
he not realise the plight of
the Old Age pensioners?
Does he not realise that
these people do not have
enough money to live on,
yet alone bank? These
people are not concerned
about the name of a bank.
I suggest, Harry, you have
our priorities wrong.

R U B B I S H
Dear Sir,
Although you must sure-
ly have been inundated
with letters on this subject,
I feel obliged, neverthe-
less, to express my views
on this, perhaps the most
important question of the
century. I refer of course
to the present controversy
over plastic milk bottles.
Much has been said
against these inoffensive
containers and yet they
have not retaliated in any
way. Have you ever
thought about the other
side of the argument? How
would you like to be a
plastic milk bottle?—un-
loved, unwanted, condem-
ned without a fair trial. For
some unfortunate plastic
milk bottles there is noth-
ing more we can do—they
have been melted down to
unrecognisable lumps, but
we can save others this
ignominious end. Luckily
for us these plastic bottles
are not unreasonable. It is
not too late to make am-
ends for our past undoings
—they are willing to for-
give and to forget. Surely
it is now up to us to go out
and meet them half-way?
We cannot alter the past,
but we can assure them of
a better future, and a bet-
ter tomorrow.
Perhaps there are a few
niggling doubts left in
your mind? You wonder
perhaps where we can
store these aesthetic ob-
jects? I do not refer to the
five or six hundred plastic
milk bottles every family
will keep around their
house—Five or six hund-
red that give their home its
informal "lived in" appear-
ance so greatly prized
nowadays. No. We are con-
cerned with the millions
that we will surely possess
in a few years time. You
may rest assured that suit-
able places will be found
for them where they can
spend their next million or
so years undisturbed—but
not forgotten. Even now
plans are being drawn up
for giant pyramid-like
structures made entirely of
empty plastic milk bottles.
These could be monu-
ments to the inventors of
plastic containers.
Much else can be done
on a smaller scale. It is up
to the people of this coun-
try to show they care.
Yours etc.,
Meigo "Thrip" Frobisher

Apply, in person if possible, to
the Hospitality Section, British
Council, 11 Portland Place, Lon-
don, W.1.
Dear Sir,
_ I must protest about
FELIX getting itself into
boring politics again. I
refer of course to your
malicious editorial slander
of our comrades the I.R.A.,
who, you unfortunately al-
lege, were responsible for
the recent fireworks at the
Post Office Tower.
The I.R.A. are courag-
eously struggling, along
with the working masses,
for the liberation of Ulster
and its reuniffication with
Eire, where they will be
free to spread the illegalis-
ation of birth control and
ban the books of Ireland's
best writers.
Yours faithfully,
P. R. O'Hack
