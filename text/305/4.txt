Weekends away from I.C. at which general topics of
interest are discussed
There are four Touchstone Weekends each year: two in the autumn term and
two in the spring term. They were started in 1950 by Air-Chief Marshal Sir Roder-
ick Hill as informal weekends with a set discussional topic about the same time
as General Studies were founded. Both were founded to help to restore the
balance between arts and science in an all-science college. I think that both
Touchstone and General Studies are a very important part of this college and
they offer the chance for both Staff and students to climb out of their science-
orientated shells and gain a broader outlook on life. Both are arranged by Mr.
McDowall, who lives behind a door labelled "General Studies" on level 3, College
Block.
Touchstone weekend starts on Saturday after lunch when a coach leaves from
the Union Arch arriving at Silwood Park in time for afternoon tea. Accommoda-
tion is in dormitories in huts and is of varying degrees of comfort depending
upon one's skill in choosing a bed. After tea everyone assembles in the senior
common room in the main house. Mr. McDowall then explained the history and
aims of Touchstone, these being to give staff and students an opportunity to dis-
cuss various topics that will not necessarily concern them in their work. The
guest speaker is then invited to sit on the "Soap Box of Free Speech" to give
his talk (he usually prefers to stay in his chair). The talk lasts about one hour, after
which there is general questioning of the speaker and discussion until the bar
opens for a pre-supper drink. After the evening meal three or four groups of
about eight people are formed and sets of questions are passed around which have
been thought up to help discussion.
Bo's Sunday Morning
Jaunt
For the 15th year in suc-
cession, Boanerges, the
City and Guilds veteran
car, successfully com-
pleted the London - Brigh-
ton veteran car Rally on
Sunday, November 7th,
with 4 | hours to spare.
The maximum average
speed allowed is 20 m.p.h.
and despite various stops
due to overheating (mainly
caused by the President's
interest in the outstanding
scenery) losing the Presi-
dent's hat (next to a beau-
tiful girl, by chance) and
stops for the President to
communicate with nature
(and the women along the
route) Bo managed to
average over 19 m.p.h., ar-
riving in Brighton only 7
minutes after the earliest
permitted time.
This performance was
largely due to the many
hours of hard work by Rob
Mathews (Bo driver) and
the other members of the
Motor Club, who stripped
and rebuilt the gearbox,
overhauled the ignition
system and carried out the
many other jobs required
to bring Bo to his present
excellent running condi-
tion. We are also indebted
to the mechanical engi-
neering workshop staff

'Silwood Park as it was in 19^7'
The whole evening, with a break for a drink in the
middle is spent discussing. Usually the groups split up
around 11 o'clock or midnight and people then disperse,
many to play snooker or darts.
Sunday morning is left completely free and most
people go for a walk in Windsor Great Park, reassem-
ling in the "Imperial Bar" at the Cannon before lunch.
After lunch everyone reassembles in the Senior Com-
mon where conclusions to each question are taken
separately and discussed, then the speaker sums up,
bringing the weekend to a close.
The first Touchstone Weekend of the year took place
on 30th-31st October. The guest speaker was Sir
Robert Birley, K.C.M.G., M.A., F.S.A., who talked about
"Nationalism Today". I found the weekend was cer-
tainly the most stimulating Touchstone that I have been
to.
Sir Robert started by defining nationalism, quoting
from various sources and using the basic definition of
nationalism as the feeling amongst a group of people
of a unique common heritage and possessing a country.
Having set up this definition of nationalism he pro-
ceeded to talk about various cases of nationalism
throughout history, from 90 B.C. when Corfinium at-
tempted to free itself from the ties of Rome, to the pre-
sent day where he discussed Welsh, Scots, Quebecois,
and African nationalisms amongst others. Sir Robert
also talked about the special problems of places like
Bengal and Ireland where certain minorities felt they
were being persecuted and said that it was his belief
that posterity would judge a nation by the way that it
treated its minorities.
The next Touchstone Weekend is on 4th - 5th Decem-
ber on the topic:—"America and Asia — the clash of
cultures". This is the centenary Touchstone and so it
will be a very special one.
UNION FINANCE
In most years about 85
or 90 per cent of the
Union's income is derived
from student fees, paid
automatically. This amount
in 1970-71 was £23,376.
Expenditure was about
£27,000; but the balance
was met by income from
life members, the Union
Bookshop, investment in-
terest, etc.
How was the expendi-
ture allocated? About 34%
of it can be grouped under
four broad headings:—
General Services and Ad-
ministration
16.7%
Newspapers, duplicating
and posters, repairs and
minor replacements, in-
surances, rent of TV's,
secretarial help, sabba-
tical year payments, etc.
NUS
3.5%
Half of the annual sub-
scription (the College
also contributed), stu-
dent conference costs,
legal aid sub.
Publications
4.5%
(Felix, Phoenix, and
grant to USK handbook).
Grants to various Union
and College organisations.
9.4%
(Academic Affairs, Wel-
fare, and External Af-
fairs Committee, Sil-
wood Park Committee,
ICWA, Haldane Library,
Exploration Board, and
Nightline, and the Day
Nursery).
The remaining 66%
(about £17,600) was
largely spent on the stu-
dent clubs and societies
—an area which receives
particular attention in the
DES proposals. T h i s
money is channelled in
three ways: —
Clubs Committees
(£11,300).
42.4%
(The Athletics, Recrea-
tional, and Social Clubs
Committees control 85
student clubs and Soci-
eties).
Capital Equipment
Expenditure
8.5%
The grant administered
by the Union Finance
Committee which re-
ports to Council. The
stock of equipment and
motor vehicles is worth
about £16,500 and the
1970-71 grant (£2,300)
was mainly used for re-
placement of worn-out
items.
Constituent College
Unions (£4,000).
15%
The C&G, RCS and RSM
Unions control another
40 student clubs and so-
cieties; and the major
part of their expenditure
goes to these.
Voluntary Subscriptions.
Membership of most
clubs and societies already
involves payment of sub-
scriptions, and many of
these would have to be
very considerably in-
creased if the Union
grants were terminated.
Subs now range from the
nominal (e.g. 12£p), to a
level of 75p or £1 for sports
clubs. Boat Club members
pay £2.50; and Gliding
members £10 (with very
substantial launching fees
and soaring fees as well).
Travel and other costs are
only subsidised to a limi-
ted extent. A number of
clubs pay instructor's fees,
and many are affiliated to
national organisations or
controlling bodies.
Financial Control
Union Council, the main
sub-committee, and the
Constituent Colleges ap-
prove detailed estimates at
the start of each year. The
Union Treasurer and eight
other Senior treasurers
(members of staff) aid the
committees in budget con-
trol. At the end of each
financial year the accounts
are professionally audited,
and included in the Col-
lege's annual report.
Ultra Vires payments.
Normally at least 10% of
income is obtained from
other sources than the
L.E.A. fees, so it is not pos-
sible to say that any par-
ticular single item of ex-
penditure is a direct
charge on the fees. Micro-
scopic scrutiny by the
Comptroller General might
identify one or two pay-
ments which could be held
to further political opinions
that are obviously not re-
lated to the general pur-
poses of the Union; but
these would be very small
indeed.
Increasing costs and the
Union subscription.
Inflation and the growth
of Union activities have led
to two increases in the rate
of the Union subscription
in the past 10 years. Each
of these was carefully and
responsibly assessed by
joint College/Union work-
ing groups; and accepted
by the Governors. The fee
was raised to £7 per stu-
dent this year, as an in-
terim measure: but it is
agreed that it should go to
£10 in October 1972 if the
Union is to meet its gene-
ral needs, provide ade-
quate staffing for the
office, and fulfil its respon-
sibility for the upkeep of
furniture and furnishings in
the various premises it
uses.
Hitherto the College has
been the Union's paymast-
ter only in the sense that
it has transmitted the ap-
propriate sums from the
L.E.A. fees, and has ap-
proved the a n n u a l
accounts. The new propo-
sals could change this by
introducing, for the first
time, a conflict between
the financial needs of the
Union and those of other
claimants on the College's
overall resources.
without whose help Bo
would have stopped work-
ing long ago.
This year's Brighton
run was one of the best in
recent years. Not only
was Bo sent off by 50-plus
pyjama-clad Guildsmen
boomalaka-making wildly,
but there were over 70 at
the traditional Motor Club
meal to celebrate Bo's suc-
cessful trip. However, we
want 100 next year, so
wake up all of you sleeping
Guildsmen and come
along. It's a great day out
and even if you don't like
cars there's an alcoholic
choir practice on the way
back. (I can't think of any
Guildsman who wouldn't
like that—Ed.).
For those who are inter-
ested, Bo is a 1902 James
and Browne 9-h.p. Ton-
neau. Built in Hammer-
smith, it is the elder of the
two remaining examples of
this marque. It has a hori-
zontal twin-cylinder engine
of 2.45 litres capacity
(that's 2.45 x 1027 cubic
angstroms to you R.C.S.
men or 4.32 pints if you're
in Mines). With its alloy
crankcase and gearbox,
straight-cut gears, giving
40 m.p.h. per 1,000 r.p.m.
in top, and triple-choke
progressive carb, it's per-
formance is not far short
of (nerve) shattering.
The present Boanerges
was bought by the college
in 1933 when the original
one, a Rover, was found to
have been built post-1904,
not in 1903 as was first
thought, and hence was
too young for the Brighton
run (though it had com-
pleted the run several
times before V.C.C. dis-
covered its c o r r e c t
age). The Rover had an
ignominious end when it
was pushed, minus its en-
gine and gearbox, but
with an effigy of the
Prime Minister sat at the
steering wheel, to No. 10
Downing Street, and left
to the country.
In more recent years,
Guilds has had a Bo Belle.
However, after last year's
fiasco (supposedly the 1st
Union Meeting of the year)
when Bo Belle was elec-
ted, it was decided not to
subject the ladies of
Guilds to the ordeals of
parading amidst jeers and
whistles, which tended to
produce rosy cheeks and
deflated egos.
As well as participating
in the Brighton run, Bo
also takes part in many
Guilds events, including
Carnival collections, sup-
porting the boat crews on
Morphy Day (what was
that about driving along
the bank towing some-
thing?), carol singing, The
Lord Mayors Show and not
only British but Italian
Television.
We are confident that if
the present level of sup-
port for Bo is maintained,
he will go on as long as
Guilds exists.
