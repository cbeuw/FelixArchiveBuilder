SPOT FIVE RCS PRESIDENTS on a Union Bar table and
there's a chance to take a rare picture. Wait for them
to do a zumba and FELIX has a classic front page!
F r o m left to right: falling oif the table is Sean O'Boyle ( R C S President
79-80), next is the shocked Pete Maltbaek (77-78), Chris Fox ( R C S Pres.
78-79 & I C U Pres 79-80), R i c h Archer (80-81) and Dave Thompson
( R C S President elect).
The zumba was the high point of last Sunday's R C S bar night which
was held to celebrate the election of next year's Exec.
R i c h Archer commented to F E L I X that he would be proud to see the
photo in print. Both Sean and Dave laughed when shown a copy.
Engineering Professors
want fewer students
E N G I N E E R I N G professors are to call for a major reduction in numbers
of engineering students studying at universities. At its annual assembly
this month, the engineering professors conference is expected to pass a
resolution calling for a 25% reduction in future numbers ol engineering
students, a drop from the present figure of about 10,000 to 7,500.
The move, which is being recommended by the committee of the
conference, is being put forward to ensure that the new four-year
degree courses, proposed by the national conference on engineering
education and training, can be introduced.
Professor Robert Smith, C h a i r m a n of the conference, said that if
present student numbers were kept at the university for a further year,
the present £270m annual cost of engineering education would be
raised by a further £80m. " I n the present economic climate there is
little chance of getting that money," he added.
Instead, it is proposed that the engineering student population
should be kept at present levels but would remain at university lor an
extra year. This would reduce available places by 25%, cutting
additional costs, and four year degrees to about £10m.
The engineering professors plan, which follows discussions between
them and the University Grants Committee and the Department of
Education and Science, is being proposed because of their enthusiastic
endorsement of the four-year degree plan.
Rag Chairman
& Treasurer kicked out
T H I S Y E A R ' S R a g C h a i r m a n , Ian Hodgson, and R a g Treasurer,
Eira H a y w a r d , resigned last week, after a motion calling for their
resignations was passed by the R a g Committee.
Ian Hodgson was slammed for his lack of enthusiasm and lack of
organisational ability, in particular his failure to attract sponsorship for
the deaf children's party this weekend. Eira H a y w a r d was criticised for
her continued absence from the I C U n i o n Office thus delaying
payments to charities, and her failure to order slopshirts for sale in the
U n i o n Office.
W h e n the new R a g C h a i r m a n is elected alter Thursday's U G M , he
will take over immediately from the three C C U Vice-Presidents and
A l a n Edwards (Rag Secretary) who are currently running IC Rag.
The election for R a g Treasurer will be held at the R a g Committee
meeting on Thursday, M a r c h 19.
Steve Tyson, R a g Publicity Officer, also resigned at the meeting last
week.
Mary Whitehouse
calls off visit
M A R Y W H I T E H O U S E , a
leading member of the 'clean up
The Press and T . V pressure
groups, and a campaigner against
indecent and degrading displays
and publications did not come to
Imperial College yesterday. She
was to have given a lecture on
"Twenlie/h Century Morals" as part
of a series on "Christianity Today.''
This is the second time that M r s
Whitehouse has had to postpone
her engagement at I C . Last term
the cancellation was due to illness,
but F E L I X can only speculate as
to the reason this time.
Guilds win
Swimming Gala

swim blind-folded and with lour
fully inflated waterwings, was

Rae Snee
snatch attempt
T H E O L D R I V A L R Y between
Chelsea College, Q E C and
Imperial was rekindled last week
when students attempted to
k i d n a p the I C U D e p u t y
President. Rae Snee.
T w o students from Chelsea
came to the F E L I X office, on
Wednesday night, and asked,
" W h e r e are your U n i o n officers? -
It's important." We gave them
the number of Rae's room in Beit
H a l l .
The Deputy President was
fortunately in the company of M r
Steve Tyson. After listening to a
feeble attempt to entice Rae out of
her room. M r Tyson leapt across
the floor and slammed the door.
This incident follows M o n d a y ' s
Q E C raid on Chelsea College.
T e n 'heavies' claiming to be from
Imperial forcibly kidnapped the
Chelsea President and demanded
the donation of 30 pints of blood
for his release (a paltry amount - Ed).
City University made an
attempt last term to abduct Dave
Gayer, Guilds President, but
m i s t a k e n l y n a b b e d J o h n
P a s s m o r e . R e a l i s i n g t h e i r
mistake, M r Passmore was
quickly released, which must say
something for his importance.
It seems that Imperial has been
fairly passive in the field of
mascotry and pillage so far this
year. Is the Wooden Horse
Organisation dead or merely
dormant?

NUS demand
grant rise
Student representatives met D r
Rhodes Boyson, under-secretary
lor higher education, this week to
press their case for a 21% increase
in grants amid widespread local
action in support of the claim.
Demonstrations were held in
Glasgow, Dundee. Aberdeen and
Edinburgh, while in England
students lobbied M P s and local
authorities. They want a 15%
i n c r e a s e to k e e p p a c e w i t h
inllalion and a further 6% to
compensate lor a low award last
year.
The N a t i o n a l U n i o n of Stu-
dents believes that without this
increase, some students could be
forced to abandon their courses,
and that already many students
laced hardship in meeting hall
fees well above the £835 element
allowed at present for board and
lodging. The basic grant would
go up from £1,430 to £1,740.
Since 1978 the grant has risen
by 30% in value, but prices have
gone up by 35%, travel costs by
41%, and board and lodging by
57%.
Boyson opts
for loans scheme
D i Boyson has decided on his
f a v o u r i t e o p t i o n for a m i x e d
grants and loans scheme and will
s h o r t l y put it to a C a b i n e t
c o m m i t t e e
T h e s c h e m e , w h i c h w o u l d
replace the present system of
m a n d a t o r y a n d d i s c r e t i o n a r y
grants, is believed to involve a
flat-rate g r a n t of about £500
lopped up by loans administered
by the Department of E d u c a -
tion and Science. The loans would
be repaid when the graduate's
earnings rose above a certain
level. Tuition lees would con-
tinued to be paid in lull for home
students.

disagreement with the I C Bar
Committee decision not to raise
beer prices, in a House ol
Commons speech last Tuesday
afternoon.
The Bar Committee had
decided not to put 2p on the price
of a pint of beer, but in a budget
statement to a crowded Commons
chamber, he announced that beer
prices would go up by 4p per pint,
and spirits by 60p per bottle.
Motorists will have to pay 20p
extra on a gallon of petrol, and
smokers 14p more for 20
cigarettes.
