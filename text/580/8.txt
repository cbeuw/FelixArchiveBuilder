Little Bob Story — Light of my Town
(RCA Import)
Little Bob is wider than he is tall. He is French
and is vocalist with a band who sound not
unlike Bruce Springsteen, both in the type of
music they play and the gravelly mumbled
vocals.
Eardrum distortion as a musical technique is
little used now, but at the Hope and Anchor
last week, Little Bob used it to its fullest extent
and effectiveness, rather like the guitarist uses
harmonics. Despite this, the sound was
amazingly pure with all five band members
clearly discernable. The band is over in
England for a short, virtually unannounced
tour to promote their new album, Light of my
Town, available on RCA (France).
The set featured most of the new album,
although the emphasis was on the fast
rock'n'roll songs, such as Switchboard Julie
and Rockin Down My Street. Slower songs
such as the title track of the album, relying
more on keyboards, came over less well. The
ideas sound mostly borrowed but there is a
certain freshness and variety on the album,
where the strongest songs are perhaps the
slower ones, and particularly Steelv Blue
Morning sounding uncannily Springsteenish.
They deserve support from more than the
handful of people who turned up to see them,
half of whom were French anyway.
Grace Slick — We/come to the Wrecking
Ball (RCA)
Grace emerges triumphantly from the ruins
created by D & V Wrecking Corporation,
dynamite tucked down her strides. The fact
that she remains unscathed is as amazing as
her youthful looks, considering that this is the
Grace of Jefferson Airplane/Starship White
Rabbit St Charles fame.
And the album is even more amazing
making Motorhead sound like Joe Dolce on
acid. The title track, one of only three co-
penned by Slick with lead guitarist/vocalist
Scott Zito (the rest being by Zito alone), opens
with a mindless mayhem interspersed with
bursts of pneumatic drill. The sound is
suggestive of oily denim clad BO smelling
bikers rather than the elegant, sophisticated
lady standing in the terrified 'no, please! —
don't send me to disco dance classes' pose.
Not for the nervously disposed — this album
bears little resemblance to anything Jefferson.
Only one song, Shooting Star has Starship
overtones, with Zito sounding like Paul

Scaramouche
I am a notoriousl y heavy sleeper, and
because of this I am quite certain that all alarm
clocks regard me with suspicion and hatred.
Indeed, the only clock which has ever got the
better of me was one of those sadistic Goblin
devices which squirt boiling water over you if
you don't get up in time. Happily, it drowned
itself one day when I was out; I have spurned
teasmades since.
Still, my present bedside clock nearly had
me fooled recently. What happened was this:
in the early hours of this morning there was a
power cut, and so I went to bed. Because of
the power cut, I expected the clock to be slow
the following morning, and so when I awoke I
t u r n e d on the radio to listen for a time-
check.
I was rather puzzled by the first time check;
the clock appeared to show exactly the right
time. Fifty minutes later there was another
time-check and the clock appeared to be an
hour and forty minutes slow. When the third
t i m e - c h e c k m a d e my c l o c k a p p e a r fifty
minutes slow I was wondering whether to
concede defeat; after all, there couldn't have
been another power cut, or the radio would
have stopped. Happily, just before lunch I
realised what had been confusing me. Each
time I thought I had been looking at the clock, I
had been looking at its reflection in my bedside
mirror. This was at 12:15 precisely. H o w did
the reflection of the clock appear then?

Last Week's Solution
Using an obvious notation for 'up', 'down',
etc., the following method takes 61 moves.
Two directions are bracketed together when
they refer to the same piece.

out.
From the five people who found solutions in
61 moves, Jane Williams, Zoology 2, was
randomly chosen as this week's winner.
Next week will be the Easter F E L I X with a
special puzzle page from me, with help from
Grey Spider and others. I'm not giving any
clues as to what it will contain (I haven't any
idea myself yet) but I will say that you should
brush up on your lateral thinking before next
week
