Letters
to the
Editor
Dear Mr Marshall
I was pleased with the com-
promise reached at the U G M
between a majority of opinion
and achieving your resignation.
The latter would have caused
upheaval and extra burden on
the other U n i o n officers which
also would not have been to the
benefit of the Union.
However, may I ask that you
show kindness, toleration and
c o n s i d e r a t i o n to others. T h e
following is the reason for my
recent attitudes:
' W e a r e a l l i n f l u e n c e d b y
everybody around us. Especially
by the media. F r o m reading this
year's F E L I X , it is easy to gain
the impression that M r Marshall's
a t t e m p t s at h a n d l i n g v a r i o u s
ideas a n d people are n o r m a l
human behaviour. In the years to
come, if he is to continue and set
the precedent for future editors,
we are all liable to be nastier
p e o p l e as a r e s u l t . Is a n y
employer then going to take on
anybody from IC? O r , will we be
nasty employers?
I realise that my above argu-
ment is subjective and not easy to
prove, but I fear that it may
contain truth.
I would hope that this issue
need never be raised again.

Dear Sir (Stevie baby mate)
Just a quick word about the
self-styled nutcases who are at
present trying to get rid of you on
a m o t i o n i n the next U G M ,
which if this letter is published
will have already occurred. As
you probably realise I mean that
Pinnegar fellow, the little runt.
A n y normal person with a small
enough sense of humour could
see that your editorials along the
lines of two weeks' ago are not
exactly to be taken 100% seriously!
W h i c h is presumably Pinnegar
and his smelly little friend could
not see this. I have talked to a
number of people in the physics
department of pin beggar is a
member, and the general feeling
out of about 160 people is that
this little medlomaniac gets all he
has coming to him in the form of
letters like this and promised
muggings. (No, that has abso-
lutely nothing to do with me).
O K O K , so 48 people did sign
the letter with him that appeared
in last week's F E L I X . But my
i n v e s t i g a t i o n s l e n d to suggest
that not all those signatures were
actually backed up by the people
to whom they were supposed to
belong. N o of course I'm not
suggesting the letter was forged,
but just that some of the people
on it have perhaps in some way
been misrepresented.
Also, Steve, there was a vicious
rumour going round that pin
sucker just wanted to get onto I C
R a d i o or something.

Dear Sir
As author of the article entitled
" S t u d y in the Shadow of the
G u n " ( F E L I X 578) I should like
to add one or two further points.
T h e purpose of the article was
to give advance notice of a talk
by two Palestinian students from
a u n i v e r s i t y o n the I s r a e l i
o c c u p p i e d W e s t B a n k a b o u t
a l l e g e d i n t e r f e r e n c e b y the
o c c u p y i n g a u t h o r i t i e s . T h e
article also served as a back-
g r o u n d to the t a l k a n d the
underlying M i d d l e East conflict.
T h e M i d d l e East problem is both
old and very complex and hence
to do any justice to the subject
the article necessarily had to be
long.
I do not claim for a moment
that the history of Palestine and
Israel given in the article is a
c o m p l e t e l y objective a c c o u n t ,
b u t I c a n n o t a c c e p t M e s s r s
Cooper and Axelrod's statement
in a letter in last week's issue
( F E L I X 579) t h a t B i r Z e i t
" e n j o y s c o m p l e t e a c a d e m i c
freedom". This is quite untrue.
Most universities in the world
encourage freedom of thought
and expression, and as soon as an
outside influence curtails that
freedom, the university's very
existence is threatened. Bir Zeit's
existence is being threatened by
the m i l i t a r y a u t h o r i t i e s as
reported by the student at the
t a l k . T h i s is c e r t a i n l y not
creating peace, and since the
purpose of the U N is to create
and maintain peace and justice
in the world this offensive is not
being taken lightly.

Dear Sir
I f i n d it scandalous that a
famous author should be visiting
IC without massive publicity.
The Bookshop hasn't got any ol
his books in, he's not appearing
in the Read or Pippard Lecture
Theatres (not famous enough say
College authorities), and yet this
is the man described by T o m
D i s c h as " o n e of the science
fiction field's top bananas". I
d o n ' t k n o w w h a t M r D i s c h
meant, but in any case J O H N
S L A D E K ' s v i s i t is a n event
which deserves to be more well
known. If F E L I X doesn't send a
reporter along to Physics Lecture
Theatre 2 on Tuesday M a r c h 17
at 1:30pm, I would like to know
the reason why.

Dear Sir
I would like to reply to your
j o u r n a l i s t ' s (sic) a r t i c l e (sic)
about the L a b o u r Club's meeting
with Chris Price (Labour M P for
Lewisham).
Whatever Zarathustra's opini-
on of the meeting, it was clearly
serious and did not warrant such
a juvenile report.
F u r t h e r m o r e , it m a y be of
some interest to those people who
h a v e b e e n to c o m p r e h e n s i v e
schools to know that the remarks
"simian morons" was addressed
to them and not to Chris Price. In
addition, the phrase, "addled
brained baboon", was not used
a n d Z a r a t h u s t r a was m e r e l y
quietened and not evicted.
A n accurate account of the
m e e t i n g w o u l d have been as
follows: Chris Price talked about
t h r e e m a i n areas of p o l i c y ,
n a m e l y h o u s i n g , h e a l t h a n d
education. H e concentrated on
arguments against the present
government's policy of privatisa-
tion in these areas.
He took great pains to explain
that he was not opposed to home
ownership as such (stating that
"most L a b o u r M P s own their
own houses"), except where it
interfered with housing provision
for large numbers of people. Such
a case is council housing, the
m o n e y c o m i n g i n from rents
provides the finances for the next
generation of houses and although
h o u s e h o l d e r s w i l l p a y m o r e
m o n e y d u r i n g a l i f e t i m e of
p a y i n g rent that the a m o u n t
needed to b u y theirs, this is
absolutely necessary at a time
when private sector housing is
almost at a s t a n d s t i l l a n d i n
L o n d o n alone a p p r o x i m a t e l y
30,000 people are forced to squat
short life property.
He then went on to criticise
private medicine and in parti-
cular pay beds in N H S hospitals.
It is not at all certain that pay
beds bring substantial amounts of
money to the N H S , but it is clear
t h a t p r i v a t e p a t i e n t s l e a v e
themselves wide open to corrupt
practices. Apart from the money
they pay to the A r e a Health
Authority, private patients also
pay a fee directly to the con-
sultant, based on what treatment
is given. This obviously gives an
unnecessary incentive to consul-
tants to give expensive unneeded
operations.
F i n a l l y , he l a u n c h e d i n t o
private schools, criticising the
c h a r i t a b l e status that p u b l i c
schools enjoy, and the resulting
subsidisation of the wealthy by
the poor. A small example of this
is the way in which over the last
six years E t o n College (at present
h a v i n g t h e e x c l u s i v e lee of
£ 3 , 5 0 0 p a ) has been r e c e i v i n g
butter through a charitable E E C
scheme at 32p a pound saving the
College an estimated £10,000 a
year.

Dear Sir
Last week's F E L I X contained
an article which degraded and
humilated the I C L a b o u r Club's
Chris Price meeting.
It is deplorable that any club
o r s o c i e t y w i t h i n I m p e r i a l
College should suffer such an
unwarranted attack in the U n i o n
newspaper, especially outside the
editorial or letters section.
N o doubt it provided a good
giggle for some childish Tories at
I C but I believe the sensible
majority of students here would
agree that the small, but enthusi-
astic, L a b o u r C l u b is a coward's
target for blind right-wing abuse.
I hope the writer responsible for
the report will apologize (mat-
urely) to the L a b o u r C l u b in this
weeks F E L I X .

These are just some personal
opinions on the Hustings U G M
and the candidates involved.
W h y were contentious political
issues such a central point in the
election speeches of the candi-
dates claiming to be a-political? I
make a special reference to South
Africa. T h e candidates who were
perhaps more 'political' (although
this term is generally used to
discredit people with left-wing
views) took the trouble to stress
the importance of student issues
and their impartiality to political
affairs only to have apartheid
and other essentially irrelevant*
issues dragged up by candidates
