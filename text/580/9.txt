Don't Let WELLSOC die!!!!!!!!!!!
If anyone knows anything about the H.G. Wells Society, or
would like to take it over and run it, could they please contact
Ian Hanley (SCC Chairman) via the Union Office or Steve
Marshall who would be willing to lend a hand,but would not
have time to run it (unfortunately).
Otherwise, it will be abolished - a shame for one of the most
successful societies of latter years.
IC Football
Fifths win ULU
Lower Reserve
Cup Final
IC V v L S E IV
1 — 0
T H E previous Saturday had seen ICV beat
Q M C I V by four goals to two and h e n c e
confirm them as champions of league SR.
On Saturday, March 7, ICV played against
L S E IV in the final of the lower Reserve Cup.
On the way to the final IC had beaten Q M C
IV, Charing Cross II, Goldsmith's III and St
Thomas II, while in their semi-final L S E had
beaten IC VI, but could they beat the vastly
superior IC V?
Conditions were not ideal for good football
with the ground being very heavy. IC started
confidently with Archer, Kelly and Hardy
controlling midfield but the forwards Healy,
Burns and Dhillon created few chances as
they came up against a solid L S E defence.
When L S E did attack they had the help of the
referee and one of the linesman, but the
s t r o k n g t a c k l i n g of f u l l b a c k s A u d i n and
Gohil, the controlling influence of centreback
Hatton and the sweeping of Cable left the
keeper Brown with very little to do (thank
goodness!). About half way through the first
half Archer saw his volley well and truly beat
the L S E keeper only to hit the bar and go out
of p l a y . S u d d e n l y IC f o u n d b e l i e f in
themselves, a ball by Kelly found Healy on the
edge of the L S E box, his shot was only
parried by the keeper and Dhillon running in,
knocked the ball back to Burns who buried
the ball in the net and IC were one up. It
should have been two when minutes later
Healy weaved his way passed three defenders
and with only the keeper to beat passed the
ball to Hardy whose shot was cleared off the
line.
At half-time the score was still one-nil, the
refreshments consisting of luke-warm weak
instant tea.
In the second half L S E pushed more men
forward in a vain attempt to get the equaliser
but IC h a d o t h e r i d e a s . M i d f i e l d never
stopped running, Gohil tackled as if his life
was at stake, Audin "dealt" with the winger
admirably, Hatton won everything in the air
and Cable stamped out what attack was left.
This led to an L S E player going to hospital for
stitches and L S E were again reduced to ten
men a few minutes later when Healy mistimed
one of his rare tackles. Brown made the box
his own and stopped everything that was
thrown at him. Towards the end L S E began to
tire, Audin overlapped twice down the right
only to see the forwards squander chances,
Dhillon, Burns and Hardy all come close
when put through by both Hatton and Cable.
Dhillon was about to float a long throw-in into
the L S E box when the referee blew for full-
time. IC V had become the first football team
to achieve "the double" for years.
A special mention must go to the substitute
Ken Baldwin, and the many supporters who
turned up to cheer us on, including IC's lucky
Cup Final mascot — Shirley Coarses Wellies.
T E A M : Duncan Brown, Nigel Audin, Al
Cable, Barry Hatton, Paul Gohil, Damian
Kelly, Ian Archer, Dave Hardy, John Healy,
John Burns, Bob Dhillon. Sub Ken Baldwin.
Water Polo
IC v St. Thomas Hospital
9 — 1
IN a match at U L U pool last Tuesday, IC
scored a crushing victory against St Thomas'
Hospital. With one goal against us in the first
'quarter'. Boucher scored two fine goals in
q u i c k s u c c e s s i o n to r e g a i n the t e a m ' s
collective confidence. From then on, IC just
k e p t o n s c o r i n g , m a r k i n g t i g h t l y a n d
generally passing well.
All credit to everybody involved for a fine
performance. If Westminster Hospital don't
scratch out next week again we'll try and
repeat our success.
T E A M : Boucher (2), Last (2), Kilgour (1),
Bradley (1), Leach (1), Porter (1). Ashwin (1),
Heffernan (goalie).
Tennis
T H E first match of the year took place on
Wednesday, March 4 away against Kings
College.
The result, never in doubt, was an easy 6 V 2 -
2 V 2 win to IC.
The first pair only dropping five games, and
the second pair winning all of their six sets.
Leaving the third pair with V 2 p t (1 set) to their
credit.
Thanks to Tony for driving and the reserve
for turning up.
The summer looks promising, but we will
need players with exams at different times as
the matches go on throughout the term. So
don't worry — if you want a match your
talents will be called upon if last year was
anything to go by.

Ten Pin Bowling
HISTORY was made at the Leeds Doubles
Tournament last Saturday. The IC team made
it to the semi-finals. The first Imperial team to
do so ever. There were six teams in each heat
and each team had to play all the other teams.
IC were in Group G and only lost one game
out of the five played and w a l k e d h o m e
overall on pi nf al I. The semi-finals consisted
of four teams playing against each other. The
competition here was tough and IC lost the
first game but pulled back by winning their
second game. At this stage every team stood
a chance of reaching the final from this semi-
final group. Unfortunately, after a poor third
game, IC was knocked out. Congratulations
must go to Engwell and Knight, the IC team,
for a good day's bowling.
The two other IC teams did not have such a
good day and were both knocked out in the
heats, even t h o u g h g o o d m a t c h e s were
p l a y e d a g a i n s t very g o o d c o m p e t i t i o n .
Thanks to Man, Smith, Quinn and Cook for
c o n t r i b u t i n g to an o u t s t a n d i n g Imperial
presence. Thanks again to John Knight for
providing transport.
Snooker
Y O U could have knocked me down with a
feather when it became apparent that the B
t e a m w e r e g o i n g to l o s e to L S E l a s t
Wednesday. The final result was 3-2, after we
lost the first three frames we seemed doomed
to a h u m i l l i a t i n g d e f e a t . H o w e v e r fine
performances by Bennett and myself saved
our reputation. It now looks as if the B team
will not be league champions this season,
mainly because of the upsets in the team's
structure over the last few weeks.
The A team is g o i n g from s t r e n g t h to
s t r e n g t h a n d c a p i t a l i z i n g on the p o o r
performance of its rivals. They won hand-
somely against Q M C by only dropping one
f r a m e . T h e y are on the v e r g e of t o t a l
boredom if they win the league.
The C team provided everyone with laughs
as they scraped a narrow victory over LSE's
second team. Their performance was their
usual cautionary, tactless effort.
Sailing
L A S T weekend saw the British Universities
Sailing Association Trials at the Welsh Harp.
Out of thirty-five competitors from all over
the c o u n t r y , L e w i s a n d B a x t e r , both of
Physics 2, won through in convincing form to
take two of the six places in the team.
Chris Lewis won two of the three races he
sailed. Unfortunately in the third race his
boat's mast snapped.
James Baxter won one race and came
second in his only other, and happily didn't
wreck any boats.
' W r e c k e r ' L e w i s was later a s k e d to be
Captain of the B U S A Team which is to sail the
American Universities in the summer.
Ladies Rugby
IC v Warwick 4*16
L A S T Sunday, the intrepid IC Ladies 14 set
out for Warwick just in time to stop anyone
getting a drink beforehand! We arrived to find
our opposition with 13 players — things were
looking up!
Play was very s l o w due to the m u d d y
conditions, but unfortunately they weren't as
slow as we were, and they scored their first
try after about ten minutes. Possession was
fiarly even during the first half, although
Warwick were allowed to score again shortly
before half-time. IC started the second half a
lot better, and for ten minutes we put them
under a lot of pressure, keeping play within
their 22. However, the moving mountain they
had at fly-half then got the ball, and ran the
length of the pitch to score their third try. For
the whole of the second half we had a lot
more possession, but could not seem to
score. Then in the last couple of minutes,
after yet another five-yard scrum, Mary sent
their fly-half 'flying' as she tried to kick the
ball, and Andree dropped on it to score, just
before the final whistle blew.
T E A M : Lois, Sara, Jane, Pam, Steph,
Andress, Mary (Capt), Rad, Sabs, Les, Jill,
Helen, Cathy, Ruth.
