who had seconds earlier promised
a reduction of 'political' issues at
U G M s . A m I alone i n holding
strong views on hypocrisy.
Secondly, I was surprised at
the number of candidates a n d
proposers w h o 'slagged-ofF this
years exec i n hustings speeches.
Constructive criticism is invalu-
able. If these people thought that
the U n i o n was going wrong, why
didn't they step i n a few months
ago a n d give some useful help.
O k a y , so it might have been a less
t h a n d y n a m i c y e a r f o r t h e
U n i o n , but who can cast the first
stone? T h e Exec should not be
used as scapegoats lor a l l the
shortcomings as they are not the
o n l y m e m b e r s o f the U n i o n .
Snide comments are not useful in
improving the U n i o n a n d they
are a n appalling form of election
technique.
*I say irrelevant i n the sense
that the Exec must represent the
views of the U n i o n as expressed
by democratic meetings. There-
fore their o w n views are worth
only as much as anyone else's.
By the way, Steve, where is the
article I submitted a few weeks'
ago?

Ed's Note
(Pete, I read your article written
in y o u r p o s i t i o n as U n i o n
Welfare Officer and found that it
contained absolutely no informa-
tion, so I discarded it.)
Dear Steve
As o r g a n i s e r o f t h e C o n s o c
opinion poll ( F E L I X 578) I feel I
must a n s w e r some o f M a r t i n
C a s e y ' s c r i t i c i s m s a b o u t i t s
validity.
1. H e says he fails to see how
any political group c a n get a
meaningful result from such a
p o l l . H o w e v e r , t h e first four
sections were c o n c e r n e d w i t h
i t e m s o f g e n e r a l i n t e r e s t t o
students not with party political
points, a n d the last p a r t ( o n
C N D ) was included as a response
to the interest i n the subject
b e i n g generated b y I C C N D
themselves here.
2. W e dispute his claim that
different -wording and ordering of
the C N D questions would have
given a 'quite opposite response',
the questions were worded in a
n e u t r a l f a s h i o n , a n d d i r e c t l y
prove the major planks of the
C N D argument.
3. R e g a r d i n g the U G M of
December 2, the C N D motion
was debated i n a highly charged
atmosphere, and to put it mildly,
was not opposed i n the most
informative way it could have
been, thus giving the proposer,
O w e n G r e e n e , v e r y m u c h a
monopoly of credibility. T h e
Consoc poll allowed people to
make their minds up coolly a n d
individually a n d we regard the
C N D findings as valid.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
Over the past term Consoc has
in various ways sought to curtail
or d e n i g r a t e the a c t i v i t i e s o f
Imperial College C N D Group. I
am glad they take us seriously.
U n t i l now I have been unable to
consider them in the same light,
but their tactics impel me to
object v i a your columns.
Apart from a selective ques-
tionnaire a n d a n uninformative
e d i t o r i a l i n t h e i r newsletter,
Consoc has distributed a leaflet
supporting the case for deploy-
ment of Cruise missiles. Amongst
other distortions and unsupported
emotive language, this includes
t h e a r g u m e n t t h a t R u s s i a n
military spending (17% of G N P
compared to 5.2% of U S G N P )
i n d i c a t e s a r e l a t i v e R u s s i a n
build-up. This comparison is a
nonsense. A p a r t from the validity
of these statistics (no references
are g i v e n i n t h e leaflet), the
i m p o r t a n t figure is the total
e x p e n d i t u r e ( $ 1 6 3 b i l l i o n f o r
Warsaw Pact countries against
$164.7billion for N A T O coun-
tries i n 1977 — not including
France — is quoted by the U S
A r m s Control and Development
Agency; hardly Soviet propo-
ganda).
R e g a r d l e s s o f the rights o r
wrongs of Consoc's or C N D ' s
beliefs, for a group of people
engaged i n higher education at a
scientific college to use this kind
of distorted logic to support their
case is absolutely disgraceful. It
weakens Consoc's credibility.
I question both the intelligence
and the ethics of those responsible
for this scurrilous propaganda.

Dear Sir
It w a s w i t h m o r e t h a n a
passing interest we noted the
W I S T circular, re: Mines Review,
w h i c h a p p e a r e d l i k e a r a s h
around the College refectories
last week.
Our attention was drawn to
the second paragraph that a
woman's primary role is a sex
object, w h o just .BwshEs exists to
s a t i s f y m e n ' s w i s h e s . " T h e
crossing out is W I S T ' s not ours.
A Freudian slip perhaps?
Yours sincerely

T H O S E of you around College
in the past few years will no
doubt remember Bernie Smith,
the Physics Dep Rep who "repre-
sented one filth of College", also
stood l o r I C U H o n Sec, a n d
twice defeated i n elections for
Welfare Officer.
Bernard is now a part-time
M S c student at the University of
S u r r e y w h e r e a l t e r " t w e n t y
days" in the place (not counting
this sabbatical campaign) he has
succeeded i n being elected o n
first preference votes alone as
Sabbatical Vice-President, with
responsibility for Welfare a n d
Education. H e polled 650 first
preference votes out of 1,200 cast,
beating his nearest rival bv over
200 votes.
H a v i n g achieved this he is very
likely to find himself unopposed
as Surrey area N U S convenor, a
post which invariably goes to a
Surrey University sabbatical.
