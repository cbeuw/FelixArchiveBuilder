UGM Shocker
FELIX Editor
thwarts bid to oust him
Last Thursday the Hustings UGM was held before a packed
Great Hall, and broadcast live on STOIC and IC Radio. The
meeting also discussed a motion of dismissal of the FELIX
Editor.
T h e meeting opened after 1:00pm with over live hundred people
present. The S T O I C lights glared down on the Exec table at the front,
and the first of the large number of paper planes to be thrown during
the meeting took to the air. M a r k Gillette quickly moved that the
motion on the F E L I X Editor should be discussed after the H o n See's
Business, and this was accepted on the vote. The President, D P and
H o n Sec gave their respective Exec News reports, and these
were all accepted.
Dave Pinnegar then proposed the motion against the F E L I X Editor.
M r Pinnegar relied heavily on the argument that by his editorial
comments and otherwise M r Marshall had laid the U n i o n open to suits
for defamation of character and libel. H e argued that the editor should
not have made the comments he did about Princess Anne. M r Pinnegar
received two extensions to give him four minutes speaking time. These
were readily agreed to by the meeting.
At this point, G r a h a m K i n g proposed an amendment to delete the
clause "the present F " E L I X Editor shall be deemed dismissed'' and
to insert a clause withdrawing the Editor's sabbatical grant for one
week. H e thought a "no confidence'' motion was too severe, but that the
Editor needed to be reprimanded. D a v i d Pinnegar spoke against the
amendment and it was not carried.
At this point Patrick C o l l , F E L I X Stall' Orator rose to address the
meeting. Speaking on behalf of M r Marshall, he outlined the
procedure by which a sabbatical can be dismissed, pointing out that a
motion passed at two U G M s with two thirds majority were required to
remove the Editor. It would take to the middle of next term to remove
him from office. " T h i s meeting," he said, "is probably the best
attended and most representative U G M this session and therefore it
provides the best test of opinion of the student body at this College. The
voting on this motion will be more than a test of opinion, it is a vote
of no confidence in Steve Marshall, and in F E L I X this year.
" U n l i k e the U n i o n Executive, M r Marshall is a man of definite
opinion and beliefs and does not treat this motion lightly. H e is only
willing to edit the newspaper as his judgment allows, or not at all, and
he has no wish to stay in office on technicalities. Therefore, if this
motion is passed against him by the required majority here today, he
will immediately tender his resignation as F E L I X Editor. If a motion
of no confidence is to be passed, then it should mean what it says. If it is
honestly your opinion that he should go . . then he will.
" I n that event F E L I X will be edited by the H o n Sec who cannot
realistically be expected to do two people's jobs well. The standard of
F ' E L I X will fall, and an outlet lor student opinion would be lost.
V o t i n g for this motion serves no useful purpose vote against i t " .
After this, M a r k Gillette summed up lor the motion, referring to the
libel issues, adding that D r M o n r o was considering suing the U n i o n ,
but he made no reference to the editor's threatened resignation. The
motion then went to a vote, which was a hand count as the issue was
regarded as sufficiently important. The voting was 232 lor, 227 against
with 46 abstentions. Therefore, the motion was not passed by the
required majority.
The meeting then moved on to the hustings lot sabbatical president,
deputy president and honorary secretary. Alter this, a procedural
motion was passed to allow the E l Salvador motion to be considered
next. T h e motion expressed solidarity with the people of E l
Salvador in their current situation. A n amendment, to send J o h n
Passmore to E l Salvador, was not put, and t he motion was defeated.
At this point Dare Afolabi proposed a procedural motion that the
B r a n d t R e p o r t m o t i o n be c o n s i d e r e d next. Jon F i r t h , U G M
C h a i r m a n , however refused to accept the motion, and M r Aiolabi then
proposed a motion challenging the Chairman's ruling. This was
overwhelmingly defeated on the vote. The meeting went on to pass
three B y e - L a w changes on t h e i r first r e a d i n g . These c o n c e r n e d
extending the grounds on which College staff may become life members
of the U n i o n , disbanding I C W A and placing the Ents C h a i r m a n on
Council. A t this stage, Steve Goulder moved a motion for adjournment
and this was passed 75-67 at 3:20pm.
Next year's Sabbaticals: Mark Smith (FELIX Ed) in foreground and (left to right)
Marco Ledwold (Hon Sec), Nick Morton (President), Barney McCabe (DP).
Next Year's Sabbaticals
Next year's Sabbatical Officers are to be Nick Morton,
President; Barney McCabe, Deputy President, and Marco
Ledwold, Honorary Secretary. The results were announced at
the Results UGM yesterday afternoon.
The meeting opened at 1:15pm to about 350 people in the Great
H a l l , but without ' M i k e ' , I C U ' s mascot, present.
The President briefly pointed out an article in that day's Times
which said that the University Grants Commission were going to make
representations to the Government about education cuts. T h e Deputy
President, announced that the U n i o n estimates would go in to College
for considerations next Tuesday.
The H o n Sec, L i z Lindsay, announced the retirement ol'John Fuller
a popular College Traffic W a r d e n , and presented him with I C U Social
Colours.
J o h n Passmore, as sabbatical r e t u r n i n g officer announced the
election results. These were:

The total poll in each election was 1,694. After these results, M a r k
Smith, next year's F E L I X Editor, made a short statement outlining his
plans for his term of ollice.
L i z Lindsay took over as returning officer at this point in the
meeting. Hustings were held for U G M C h a i r m a n , between Steve
Goulder and Phil M e r r y m a n . The meeting ratified the election of Ian
Greenwood as U L U Rep, M a r t i n Taylor as External Affairs Officer,
and Sean Coyle as I C C A G C h a i r m a n (the only candidates). Hustings
were held for the post of R a g C h a i r m a n between M a r k Wilkins, Bi.l
Durodie and Deborarh Nicholls.
A point of order was made asking the C h a i r m a n to tell the S T O I C
cameraman to turn his headphones down as it was disturbing having to
listen to them. This request was accepted.
Husting was thus held for the post of Academic Affairs Officer,
between Lee Paddon and M i k e Booty.
The U G M went on to the motions, and a procedural move was
made to place a motion on W i l l i a m Cortazzi (instructing that he
should be thrown in the ' R o u n d Pond') at the head of the agenda.
Before it could be voted on, W i l l i a m Cortazzi successfully challenged
Q u o r u m , showed his Unioncard and withdrew hastily from the Great
H a l l .
Most other people there though stayed on for an informal discussion
on the motion.
The results of the elections held by paper ballot at the U G M were
announced later, and Steve Goulder, Bill Durodie and M i k e Booty
were elec ted. Papers for Welfare Officer are to remain up on the Lower
Lounge noticeboard as no one has stood lor the post.
