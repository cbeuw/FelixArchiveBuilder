Some Honest Guff!
Re: Mr Pinnegar's motion of No Confidence in the
Editor of FELIX.
Some concern has been expressed over my
way of producing FELIX. While it is true that
FELIX is the "Newspaper of Imperial College
Union", I will be the first to admit that I exert a
very strong personal influence over it. FELIX is
produced by a small group of individuals. I discuss
my ideas with them — they act as a restraining
factor on my strong desire to tear this bloody
incapable Union to fragments (Ooops!). It is
always wise to get second, third and fourth
opinions on any contentious material to be
printed in FELIX, but in the end. I am responsible.
I can only produce the kind of FELIX I think I
would like to read if I were a student. I think I have
performed that task admirably. B U T , what do
other students feel? If I felt that FELIX was not
reaching its readers, I would resign now. While I
concede it cannot satisfy everyone, I think the
majority of students enjoy reading the kind of
FELIX I enjoy producing. It is interesting to note
that only those who do not will write to inform me
so.
It is important to remember that the only
connection that the "average student" (what does
that mean?) has with the Union is via FELIX. It is
therefore essential that F E L I X enjoys press
freedom. Every student should feel that he can
have his views aired in FELIX and that is why I
encourage such an active letters page. I have
used my editorial to criticise the Union, with
special reference to our President, J o h n
Passmore. Mr Passmore has not used our much
cherished "right of reply" to defend his position;
from this you must draw your own conclusions.
(I should not restrict my condemnation to the
Exec — what about the "average student'? He
too is a fully paid-up member of the Union and
should not sit back and allow the Union to
disintegrate through poor leadership. Is there
anyone out there?)
Does Mr Pinnegar want an Editor of FELIX
such as John Passmore? Does he want me to
"Hush mah mouth"? Does he really feel that the
students of IC are so impressionable? Or would
he rather that I used my position as Editor to
provoke (is this the right word? — I think so!)
discussion within this stagnant pond of bored and
boring individuals. I'm no cynic, but when I look at
the pathetic Union that used to be so lively when
it had some actual characters in charge of it, I
sincerely feel that we need to confront our plastic
President and Executive and shout: "For God's
sake, G O ! "
This Ultra Vires Business
During the discussion of the El Salvador motion at
the Hustings U G M it was pointed out that one
section of the motion asked for ICU to affiliate to
the campaign. It was stated that in view of recent
developments concerning the C N D affiliation fee,
this action would be Ultra Vires the Constitution.
(Incidentally, "Ultra Vires" is merely a succinct
way of saying "outside the powers of".)
Immediately, Mr Passmore agreed and said
that this section would be deleted. Owen Greene
disagreed most strongly to this action, and he was
right to do so. A trend that is annoying me more
and more in this "slightly right of centre" College
is to dismiss left-wingers such as Mr Greeneasbeing
out of order. Being slightly right of centre myself, I
disagree with many of Mr Greene's views, but I
find myself agreeing with him here on this point of
principle, not ideology. It is only Ultra Vires to pay
such an affiliation fee from "trust money" such as
Union money. B U T it is quite legal to raise the
money by organising collections (such as W U S
collections) to pay the fee. A N D it should be the
Exec's job to investigate all of these methods and
organise a collection at the U G M — after all, if a
majority vote to affiliate, then surely these people
are morally bound to contribute to such a fund.
It angers me as much as it does Mr Greene that
John Passmore should A L W A Y S opt for the easy
way out, and what suits his own personal politics.
He has got his little letter from the Union
Solicitors stating the Ultra Vires position and he
clings to it like a limpet. He is quite aware that
collections tor affiliation lees are not Ultra Vires.
Anything for the easy life, eh John?
C o n g r a t u l a t i o n s
To the four new sabbaticals elected for next year.
Commiserations to the losers.
It's interesting to see that they are all R C S men.
Perhaps this says something about the highly
vocational nature of courses in Guilds and Mines.
I'm sure that next year's Exec will function as a
team — they all know each other and seem to get
on well. Might be a good year. One thing though,
what is this Twenty-Two Club they all appear to
belong to? — 1 can't find it in the Union Handbook
anywhere.
Easter Issue
Next week, 1 will be attempting to bring out FELIX
on Thursday. This will be the bumper special
Easter issue. As with the Christmas issue, I hope to
have a Scaramouche extravaganza, and maybe a
few other treats. All copy should be submitted by
Sunday lunchtime. I can't guarantee anything
submitted after that going in.
Handbook & Freshers' FELIX
Paul Donovan, Handbook Editor, wants your
articles now.
I would like to point out that it's no use thinking
that if you don't have an article in the Handbook,
that you can make up for your laziness by having
one in the Freshers' FELIX — 'fraid that's just not
on! I've had a word with next year's Editor, Mark
Smith, who tells me he will only be accepting
articles which detail a Club's activities in the first
few weeks of term from those clubs kind enough to
submit to the Handbook.
Thanks to
Colin, Mark, Patrick, Steve, Phil, Caroline, Martin,
Dave, Paul, Zar, Ian and Maz.
Incidentally, I simply L O V E SF Sock articles to
be entertaining and may I say that 1 a/u;ays find
them so. Kenneth Mann, a man so talented and
dedicated to entertaining the masses through
FELIX that he couldn't spare five minutes of his
time to do so in this year's Phoenix magazine
deserves the admiration of us all. I hope the
Phoenix (out next term) does not suffer adversely
from this sad, sad omission of creative excellence.
Hard luck to those Chelsea people who tried to
kidnap Rae Snee this week. I guess that's just
tough titties.
Finally, Happy Birthday Scaramouche!
This week's puzzle is on page 8.
I think Steve Marshall is gradually taking over
the back page. Aaarrrgh!!!!!!
