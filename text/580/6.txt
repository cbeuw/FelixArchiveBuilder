Easter
Good news for those who appliea
for rent rebates last Christmas and
were turned down because their
contract with the landlord was a
l i c e n c e r a t h e r than a tenancy
agreement. From April 1 1981 the
relevant part of the 1980 Housing
Act changes all this, giving licencees
the same rebate opportunities as
other folk. It's quite in order to apply
now and have your claim pending,
s o don't be put off by any Town Hall
officials who may not be ready to
proceed yet with the new regula-
tions. This rebate cannot be back
dated so it is important to set the
wheels in motion well beforehand.
Unfortunately 'holiday' and 'com-
pany' lets and accommodation
shared with the landlord are all still
outside the range of rent or rate
rebates, but you may be eligible for
other benefits and it is always
possible to take a 'holiday let' to the
county court for reclassification
when it is obvious that the tenants
are not on holiday.
For those who haven't applied for
any benefits before and would like
some more information here's an
updated version of last term's article
on the various ways and means
whereby rent payable over the
holidays can be wholly or partially
offset.
Supplementary Benefit
For most students this benefit can
only be claimed during the holidays
when you are available for work and
can register as unemployed. The
vacation element of the grant
(£19.20) is approximately equal to
the single persons basic SB allow
ance, so these two cancel out
leaving any rent payable during this
period as the only additional sum
that can be claimed. Entitlement to
this benefit is only valid when you are
signing on regularly as unemployed
in the same area as the one in which
you are paying rent. However, it is
possible to get a holiday form,
allowing you up to sixteen days away
from your London address. Alter-
natively, if you are away for a field
trip during the vacation or remain in
London for an extension of your
course it should be possible to get
your L E A to award you a supple
mentary maintenance grant.
How To Apply For SB
1. Register as available for work on
the first weekday of the vacation at
your nearest Job Centre.
2. A s s u m i n g that there is no
suitable job available ask to be
registered as unemployed. You will
be given a card and form B l .
3. The card is taken to the unem-
ployment benefit office (often in the
same building as the Job Centre)
where you will receive instructions
about signing on regularly.
4. Form B l is taken to the Supple-
mentary Benefit Office. An appoint-
ment system is normally in operation,
s o it may save time if you phone
them first. It will also save time if you
have all the necessary documents
with you when you go to the SB
Office to be assessed. These are as
f o l l o w s : a rent b o o k / t e n a n c y
agreement/letter from landlord or
the Student Services Office if you
are in College a c c o m m o d a t i o n ,
Welfare
including proof that you are resident
at the address stated, a recent bank
statement and a students' unioncard
or other proof of identity.
The amount of benefit that you
receive may not be your total rent
bill as various sums may be deducted,
s u c h as £4.35pw if heatin g is
included in the rent, since this sum is
included in the basic SB allowance
already balanced off by your grant.
Also, if your rent has not been
registered by the rent officer or rent
tribunal and seems higher than
average the calculations may be
based on a rent more in line with
similar accommodatin that has been
fair rented. Apart from this the
D H S S (Dept of Health and Social
Security) have a ceiling of £19 for
single householders, £14 for sharers,
£24 for a double bedsit and £24 for a
one bedroomed flat. The term
householder implies someone who is
individually responsible for all
household expenses. However it is
not precisely defined, so even if you
live in a flat or house with other
students and have your own room,
meters, etc, it may be possible to
argue that ypu are maintaining a
separate household. Furthermore, if
you share a flat and will be the only
tenant remaining during the holiday
you will be a single householder for
the relevant period. A person living
as one of the family is classified by
the D H S S as a non-householder. The
way that S B is worked out for
sharers is to classify them as non-
householders with a special addition
equal to their share of the difference
between the householder and the
non-householder scale rates (see
figures below).
To calculate your own SB, first
calculate your requirements, then
your resources. Next subtract your
resources from your requirements.
The amount you are left with should
be the amount payable per week.
Requirements
Non-householder £17.05+rent
Sharer
£17.05 + (£4.25 + no. of sharers) + rent
Householder £21.30+rent
Resources
Vacation element of grant £19.20
plus any part-time earnings (£4
disregarded)
The rate for one student sharing
with four others paying£15eachwould
be: £17.05+ £1.06+ £15 £19.20 =
£13.91.
The calculations for your SB will
be sent to you and if you disagree
with the assessment you are entitled
to appeal within twenty-one days.
A n d don't forget that anyone
receiving SB can automatically get
free N H S dental treatment, glasses
and prescriptions. So if you think
you might be needing any of them
ask for an exemption certificate
while you're at the DHSS Office.
Rent And Rate Rebates
T h e s e are available for anyone
(apart from the above mentioned
exceptions) with a low income. They
do not normally offset so much of
the rent as Supplementary Benefit,
but they can be paid even while you
are away and do not entail all the
rigmarole of 'signing on'.
How Rent And Rate Rebates Are
Worked Out
As with SB the rent is firstly equated
with similar accommodation which
has been fair rented. Then a 25%
deduction is usually made for
furniture, with a further amount
deducted (up to 25%) if heating is
included in the rent. The rate
element ( a p p r o x 25%) is also
removed, but this will be subject to
its own rebate. The basic rebate will
be between 20% and 30% of the
remaining figure. The percentage
varies according to the rent payable,
shrinking as the rent increases.
However if you're income is less
than £34.90 (the single person's
housing benefit needs allowance), as
it n o r m a l l y will be d u r i n g the
vacation, then 25% of the difference
between the income and the needs
allowance is added to the basic
figure. If your income is more than
the needs allowance then the basic
rate is reduced by 17% of the
difference between the income and
the needs allowance. For those
students who apply during termtime
some additional calculations (which I
won't go into here) complicate
things further, making it pointless
applying unless your income is well
below average.
Example for a student paying a
fair rent of £15pw (not including
heating or rates) less 25% for
furniture:
Rent:£11.25.25% Basic Rebate: £2.80.
£34.90 (needs allowance) - £19.20 (in-
come) = £15.70. 25% rebate: £3.90.
Total Rebate: (£2.80 + £3.90) £6.70.
If a rate rebate is applicable this
part is not subject to any initial
reductions, but the calculations tend
to be even more tortuous without
providing a very clear indication of
the final o u t c o m e . T h e above
example may not be typical since the
rent officers stress that each
application is unique and subject to
its own variations. H o w e v e r , it
would seem that the return is well
worth a trip to the Town Hall, if
you're not eligible for Supplementary
Benefit or Unemployment Benefit,
so give it a try and let us know how
you get on.
How To Apply For Rent And
Rate Rebates
1. It's best to phone your Town Hall
first to discover their interview
procedure and establish just where
the relevant office is since it may not
be in the main building.
2. Don't forget to have all the
necessary identification, proof of
rent and bank statement with you
(as described when applying for SB)
for anything missing will mean
another visit and possibly lost rebate
since it only begins when they have
established all the relevant facts.
Unemployment Benefit
Last, but by no means least, this is
the one to go for if you can. In order
to be eligible you will need to have
paid C l a s s 1 contributions on
earnings of at least £875 between
April 1978 and April 1979 or £976
between April 1979 and April 1980.
This will give you a basic rate of
£20.65 without any other complica-
tions, indeed you may get more if
you have earnt enough to qualify for
the earnings related supplement.
T o c l a i m : go to y o u r local
Unemployment Benefit Office on the
first day of the vacation. Any earlier
than this they will turn you away,
any later and you may lose money
since payment cannot normally be
back dated. Take your P45 with
you or a note of your national insur-
ance number.
If you run into any problems when
claiming these benefits let us know
since we may be able to help and we
appreciate any information that can
usefully be passed on to others.
