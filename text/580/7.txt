Christian Union
Most people know that Jesus Christ died on a
cross 2,000 years ago, yet few examine closer
than that. Christians believe that the death and
resurrection of Jesus is relevant to us today, and
as Easter approaches the Imperial College
Christian Union takes the opportunity of inviting
you to an open service. The service is at Holy
Trinity Brompton (behind Southside) at 12:30pm.
It will consist of readings and songs, culminating
in a talk by Steve Williams looking at the death
and resurrection of Jesus and its meaning. Steve
is a curate at Holy Trinity, Brompton. We've even
got food laid on! See you there.

A S M A L L E R G R O U P than usual ventured into
the wilds of Somerset a few weeks ago, staying at
Holford youth hostel.
The weather was fine on the Saturday and we
headed for Bridgewater Bay where we followed
the cliffs for some miles, returning by a rather
devious route in the evening.
On the Sunday we walked on the Quantock
Hills as far as Triscombe and back. Last weekend
we went camping in Langdale in the Lake District
although the weather could have been better.
O n the Easter trip to the Cairngorms in
Scotland we will also be camping and plans are
underway for the summer trip to Norway.
Yesterday (Thursday, March 12) we had our
A G M with elections for next year's committee
posts and the destinations for future weekends
were discussed.

approximately fifty students from many nations.
The opening address will be given by Mr James

Technological Research and Higher Education,
setting the ground for a conference with an

To aid with these discussions, ICU has invited a

Apologies must be made for the non-appearance
of last week's bulletin. We did submit one. It was
not printed. We were told that his was due to
"lack of space". For those of you who really want
to read it, it will be serialised on Mark Jeffcock's
badge from March 16 to 20, and marketed as a
board game by TSR early ne*t year under the
name "Cosmic Bulletin".
Now, a serious paragraph. John Sladek, world
renowned S F author, will visit Imperial College on
Tuesday, March 17, as a guest of ICSF Soc. His
speech, to be delivered in Physics Lecture
Theatre 2, will be on the subject of robots (his
current obsession), past, present and future. For
those of you who don't know, Mr Sladek is the
author of The Steam-Driven Boy, The Muller-
Focker Effect, Keep The Giraffe Burning,
Mechasm, and his latest novel Roderick. He has
also written a non-fiction work, an encyclopaedia
of crank beliefs, called The New Apocrypha. So,
turn up at the aforementioned time and place for
a really interesting free event.
This is the first talk in a planned series given by
famous authors arranged by ICSF Soc. The next
is at the beginning of next term, to be given by
Christopher Priest.
Well, I'm sorry that this bulletin has contained
so much information and so few jokes, but Steve
Marshall doesn't like us to be entertaining, and we
really do want this bulletin to get printed. Don't
worry, I promise that you won't be able to
understand the next one.
