Dear Sir,.
On returning to college last
Friday I noticed that a "reminder" had
been placed on several notice boards
that the 3rd. anniversary of the Union
bar WAS to take place on the 4th.Jan.
I l a t e r found that only about twenty
people were present.
Although an anniversary i s an
anniversary and should i f possible
be celebrated at the proper time
surely much greater support could
and would have been given i f
(a) people were reminded at a
more suitable time, and
(b) i f the date were t o be arranged^
so tnat i t f a l l s during the f i r s t
few days Of term.
A f t e r a l l , to many the bar i s one
of the few places i n the college where
the body and soul can be reintegrated
in times of "distress",and a show of
appreciation f o r one of our most
important i n s t i t u t i o n s on suoh an
"unrepeatable" occasion i s surely
the essence of "good taste",
l o u r s etc.

Dear Six,
Assuming that you do read Felix, as
assuming that you do read, then you w i l l
be aware that letters were included in the
Christmas edition complaining of the
previous publication of certain anonymous
articles, as i t were. Despite the
illustrious appalationa appended to these
several •pieties, you had. Sir, the
unmitigated gall to set alongside them
a further unsigned outrage entitled
"How to Play Chease", whioh although
grossly Inaoourate factually, and childish
in its ideas, was answered by myself in an
artlole whioh was not written. You
lacked, Sir, the oourage of your eonviot-
ions (where did you get that haircut,
anyway?). It wa agreed long ago that
any individual, whether or not attached to
"Felix" should have the opportunity of
being rude to the Editor.
Let me say right away that i t i s your
anonymous contributor's right, provided
he or she i s a ohssse-psaoe, to write what
he or she sees f i t , concerning chess*.
But, I- divine in that curious tract a
calculated and vicious blow, aimed at the
morale of CHKSS-players In our (leritu*
Collage, and indeed throughout the
country. Soma dsap laid plot la Being
hatched!
Fax be i t for me to implicate any one
group (or sub-group) in respect of the
perpetration of that dastardly article.
However, the advantages to be gained in
this by a eertaim chesse-playing Bast
European country of quite unmention-
able political inclinations must be only
too obvious to us a l l . One draws the
inevitable conclusion.
So don't let i t happen againI
Please!I
Yours embarrassedly and intolerantly,
D. Gardiner

where are you going this summer?
Whatever your tastes, whether a r t i s t i c ,
academic, or even merely pleasure
.bound, there i s sure to be a sun
drenched (or perhaps' by a meteorology
i c a l error, rain drenched) location
for your a c t i v i t i e s . Think of the
South of France, bask i n the
Mediterranean climate, see the people
at work, pr oerhape, more to your
taste, at play. Do the ancient
Greeks fascinate you? Why not go to
examine the l a s t tangible remnants of
t h e i r c i v i l i s a t i o n f o r yourself.
Even though i t i s a l l Greek to you,
there are always certain things which
transcend languages.
For any thinking young man the
most a t t r a c t i v e and exciting c i t y of
the new developing Europe i s , of
course, Berlin. Why not go there .
to discuss the world's most pressing
problem - Europe and Asia - what1
they can learn from each other.
This conference takes place during
the day, leaving you the evenings
free to see the city's night life.-
As accomodation i s provided i n the
University the t o t a l cost of the t r i p
i s kept very low - fourteen days f o r
£24 to £27 including conference fees,
meals and accomodation.
I f you are bent on culture
Oberamaagau, Saltburg or I t a l y may be
your goal. I f you would prefer to .
go further a f i e l d Poland offers you a
an opportunity to go behind the-Iron ,
Curtain. You w i l l be able to v i s i t
such places as Poznan, Wislicska,
Cracow and Warsaw. V i s i t s to Univer-
s i t i e s , f a c t o r i e s , museums and even
mines (probably not the s a l t variety)
and also opportunities to meet Polish
students w i l l be arranged. This
would certainly be a holiday to
remember and one whioh your friends
would e n v
f you are desirous of quitting
not u. y the country but also the
3ontirio.it, why not go to the United
S$«efi» and see foscyaurself the much
ftSaBStssBWi " a a e r i u a way o f We".
The may Jo gst to know tne people of
any country i s to l i v e with them and
see them at t h e i r everyday chores and
t h i s i s just what you can do. Your
host w i l l also arrange f o r
v i s i t s to s u i t your p a r t i c u l a r i n t e r -

C h r i s t m a s P a r t y
ICWA gave a Christmas party f o r
some o l d people f o r the f i r s t time
t h i s year.Decorations, f a i r y l i g h t s
and a rciaring f i r e (made, possible
by ths. kindness of Mines and
Clementine) gave a cheerful appear-
ance 'to the ICWA lounge.The guests
were looked a f t e r by as many ICWA-
r i a n s and provided with an enorm-
ous tea.
An enthusiastic and very
capable choir, composed of Mines'
men and ICWArians l e d the singing
of carols.
The guests departed w i t h
presents o f f r a i t and cake, and
i t would be d i f f i o u l t t o t e l l
whether they or t h e i r hostesses
enjoyed i t the most.
May I also oomment on the
c a r o l singing a f t e r the R e s i -
dents Christmas Dinner when over
100 students r a i s e d £35 fox the
Refugee Year Fund i n just over
an hour, and thank Jim Carter
and John Cooke f o r conducting
the singing.

"What s i z e socks does Auntie Agnes
take?".....a question which i s t y p i c a l of
the Christmas season.Now that the rush f o r
H o l l y berries i s over, and I didn't see
one, and l o t s of people f^udbled,we oan
sum up t h i s season o f goodwill to a l l men.
The f u l f i l l m e n t of t h i s necessarily e n t a i l s
suspension,for a time,of goodwill to a l l
women.
Yuletide brings out the worst i n
people;who has not heard of the indiv-
i d u a l who sends a parcel l a b e l through
the post,early of course,and with the
s t r i n g s l i g h t l y frayed.This must be
done early to give friends time t o send
a parcel back "v/asn't i t good of o l d
Percy to send us a pre3ent-pity i t got
l o s t - l e t s send him some of those braces
we had from Aunt Annie" and so on.
Who wants a p a i r of braces anyway-
I don't use them,nor b e l t s come to that.
They stay up by gUess and by Godfearing
habits.
\Te spend more on the postage than
on the cards and say i t s the thought
that counts.We a l t e r the prices and pack
pairs of braces and i t s a t e r r i b l e time
of year.
We dash to the door and stand watoh- '
ing the postman struggling-to crush a p i l e
of cards through the groaning l e t t e r box.
We seize each envelope, and spend f i v e
minutes looking at the. postmarks(Post-
mortem f o r Christmas) and handwriting,
t r y i n g to guess who sent it.Then we open
i t and i t s from someone we haven't sent
to,or we can't quite remember whether we
did 'cos the dustman came f o r h i s
Christmas box just as we were doing the
cards. Then i t ' s a b r i e f glance inside
the card and another few minutes holding
the back f l a p up t o the l i g h t to look
for erasures. Then on t o the shelf with i t
and compare i t with the value of the
others, and i t ' s s t i l l raining outside and
i t ' s a t e r r i b l e time of year.
- Comes the evening, and we brave the
weather to pay the seasonal rounds t o
r e l a t i o n s and friends-in good time to
elude the carol singers crepuscular
crescendo. And Auntie Jinny t r i e s t o
•dilute the ginger wine. /
It's Boxing Day now and the
wrestling's on the television,and you're
allowed to watch because there i s only
boxing on the other channel.Then i t ' s
two rounds of cards and i t ' s turkey
again and we're down t o the dregs of the
port. And we a l l s i t around grousing
along the l i n e s of t h i s philosophy and
I r e o a l l the postmistress t e l l i n g of a
woman, who, casting out a card proclaimed
"Not that one-it's got r e l i g i o n on".
And I'm sure i t ' s a t e r r i b l e time of year.
Charles N e v i l l e .
Both these e f f o r t s required
l i t t l e organisation and were most
suocessful-it seems a p i t y that the
College does not do more f o r other
people at Christmas time.

Ed. comment.
ICWA i s under a constant
i a r r a g e of c r i t i c i s m from a l l
quarters, but I think anyone who
was at the Old People's party at
Christmas would j o i n i n and
congratulate the President and
Seoretary f o r organising such a
happy occasion.There are many
" t r a d i t i o n s " that I.C. could
w e l l do without but l e t us hope
that t h i s new one w i l l continue
Cor many years t o give enjoyment
to older people wh» are so often
forgotten.
