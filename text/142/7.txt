FELIX 7
.RCS. H i t s L o n d o n
" I t was a jubilant eras of R.C.3.
nan who carried off the Linetead swimming
cup from the stately, sober ULU. to the
sore friendly dower Arms, i n order to
eelebrate the team's fine triuaph.
Soon, the sweet taste of victory
was augmented by the more subtle, mellow
taste of best bitter, and, inevitably,
the usual songs were sung, much to the
enjoyment of a lone Chemistry Ireshette.
The Linstead Oup was f i l l e d and
emptied with alarming regularity and, as
the atmosphere became more riotous, i t
was soon obvious that this was going to
be one of those rights.
At 10.50 p.m. a seething mass of
fifty or so stalwarts, led by president.
Long John Forster, poured out into the
0001 night air} down Tottenham Uourt
Road, along Charing Cross Road, and into
sfeairtBaaury Avenue. Every person, who
was unfortunate enough to be abroad i n
thee* famous thorough-fare*, was told of
the victory.
The theatre crowds gaped i n
astonishment. Understandably perhaps,
for i t is not every day that you see a
t a l l figure, complete'with loud check
jacket and deer stalker, swinging a large,
silver cup in- one hand, and a rolled
umbrella in,the other, striding at the
head of a boiatarsHs column of screaming
youths.
They pressed on to Piccadilly
Circus, where the President paddled i n
the fountain, and, with Oupidis arrow
aimed straight at his heart, led; a
sentimental Kangella.
, By now the Police were interested
so, Foreter. unsentimental where the
boys i n blue are concerned, led the
party towards the Mall. At this stage
in the proceedings a slight brash
oeeurred between a straggler and the law.
The following conversation tells the
whole story.
The Law.(Pointing to another straggler)
Did you throw water over him? (It was
in fact beer)
Straggler. Tee.
The Law. Why?
Straggler. He's my friend.
•Uth this, the straggler pressed on
leaving the law scratching i t s head,
rendering i f i t was possible to charge
somebody for throwing water (or beer)
over his friend.
In the Mall the party became
quieter. They formed threes and sloe-
•arohed, i n step, towards Trafalgar
Square. They passed under Admiralty
Arch i n silsnca. Then the sight of
Nelson was a signal to break ranks.
With inarticulate whoops the party
clambered up the base of the column and,
clinging perilously, gave vent to an
ear-shattering Kangella.
By now the Police had organised
Lnto a small army. As they approached
menacingly, the party scattered i n every
direction, never to reform that night.
I . C U N I O N
ffiwecpita ante* •aainforaod comment to
tile oorrferaacy i t i s aabit* easy to form a
naw olub. All'that is heeded i s to prove
the "need" f o r i t , and that the Union cam
provide the "facilities". This i s easy.
To prove the "need*, one has to show that
* sufficient number of members of the
Union are aotxvaly interested enough in
the) proposed oINfc t o give i t a reasonable
ahance sY a fairly panmanent existence.
' To show that there are "facilities", one
has to show that either the Union has
already got the necessary facilities
for the proposed dub's activities (e.g.
lecture rooms, fives court, darts hoard,
etc.) or that sufficient money exists to
institute these facilities.
A few procedural rules also exist
of course. The A.C.C. or the S.C.C.
must receive notice of the proposition
and naturally i t i s useful to know who
are the supporters of any proposed club.
A l i s t of signatories, with the proposed
objects of the new olub, must appear on
the Union Council Notice Board for
seven days, in the case of the S.C.C.
A similar procedure, though not oblig-
atory, i s often followed i n the case of
a new A.C.C. olub.
The new olub w i l l oome under the
A.C.C. i f i t s activities require physical
exertoiea and i f the olub i s competitive
by nature-
. A l l other olubs oome under
the S.C.C. including olubs such as the
Sliding,Underwater and Ski olubs whioh
often take part in competitions!'J)
The S.C.C. includes olubs of widely
different interests, and often with
conflicting objects, whioh is probably
why i t traditionally runs less smoothly
than the A.C.C.
There are rarely any arguments about
fac. .ties. Either they exist or
they <i«i i. The trouble occurs over
what constitutes a "need".
Some people think that the "need"
for a club jean be proved by the number
of signatories on a b i t of paper.
However i t should be obvious that this
cannot be the entire criterion. It
could well happen, i f there were only
five Catholics in College, that only
five signatories could be obtained.
Despite this an active committee could
be formed and the objects of a Catholic
Society are such that they play an
important role i n College l i f e . On
the other hand, a hundred drunks have
been easily persuaded to support &
proposed Hedonist Club but i t i s
doubtful whether such a Club had much
future.
Consequently, no specific number
of signatories i s constitutionally
necessary. The decision on "need" i s
taken after consideration of the" number
of supporters, the objects of the
proposed olub and any outside factors
whioh may appear relevant.
The greatest,obstacle to the form-
ation of any new olub i s the tendency
of people i n the saddle to look upon
janything new as unnecessary. Frequent-
ly the arguments used against new olubs
oould equally well have been used
against the formation of a l l I.C. Clubs
at any time.
However the objeots of both the
A.C.C. & the S.C.C. include the encou-
ragement of a l l forms of Social and Ath-
letic activity. There are to the best
of my knowledge, applications for seven
new olubs pending. It i s to be hoped
that as many as possible are successful
as the newcomers must further enrich
our College l i f e . John Cox,

A Few Notes (?)
The rugger oluh i s eventually settling
down and playing some good football. I t
was thought midway through the Michaelmas
term that we would not be able to run 7
teams. We did however manage to do so
onoe and but for cancelled matches would
have done so on a number of other occasions.
The f i r s t team record i s good, having
won 11 and drawn 1 of their 16 matches.
The ex 1st team has not as yet shown itself
to be "just a l i t t l e b i t behind .the 1st
team." The 'A' team oapably led by Tom
King has won the majority of i t s matches
and with the ex 'A', skippered by St John
BjgkaLsy has provided the 'strength in the
middle' so necessary to a large club.
Dave Titley'a Bi and Hank's lot (B2)
have enjoyed themselves during the past term
with the B2 actually recording u number of
notable victories. The B1 team have
certainly been unfortunate in loosing a
number of their matches by the odd one or
two points.
Altogether the rugger has been good,
but i f we are to improve our results a
l i t t l e more work i s necessary a l l round.
Team records w i l l appear, I hope, in the
next issue.

B I L L I A R D S & S N O O K E R
The first snooker team has played
seven matches this term, five of whioh
were won, the other two being drawn.
Second team match.es have been very
difficult to oome by, and the teams
record to date is one win and one draw.
The extra balls required for the
playing of "snooker»pluB* are now .
available in the snooker room, and the
game appears to be very popular a l -
though a reactionary group whioh prefers
snooker does exist i n the olub.
The Freshers' Tournament was won
by J. Cleaton who i s a second year
Mechanical Engineer, but now to the olub.
