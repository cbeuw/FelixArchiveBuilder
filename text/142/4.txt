Controversy ranged high over
"commentary",many people expressing
the view that i t was too political in
nature. FELIX is essentially ncn-
political and non religious, as i s
Imperial College Union, and as a
question of policy was at stake, i t was
brought to a head at the Editorial meeting
at the latter end of last term..At the board
meeting i t was deoided that the columns of
FELIX should be open to views on ANYTHING
which primarily concerns students,
including both religious and political
views-provided that FELIX did not .
express an opinion and,that although
the article might be printed anonymously
that, I, as editor should.know the '
-
.
.
author's name; each case to be considered
individually on i t s own merits.
With the above reservations, controv-
ersial view points on a l l topics-even
EDITORIALS-are always welocme.However,
FELIX wishes to make i t clear that the
writers views do not, and this invar-
iably happens, coinoide with i t s own
or those of the union.

Dear Sir,
I was delighted to read in your last
but one issue the 'flea For Action' by
Randal Peart. Although I do not wholly
agree with what was written, i t was good
to see that some thought had gone into
the question of lecturing, and an attempt
had been made to arrive at practical
impr^overaents. It is, of course,
impossible to divorce this problem from
the question of what universities are
for, and why J we as students spend a
number of years experiencing the '
'University process'. If these latter
aspects had been considered, then I am
sure Mr Peart's conclusions would have
been different.
I know for a fact that quite a high
percentage of the staff at IC do buy arid
read'Felixi As yet there has bean no
answer or glimmer of l i f e from these
people, and yet another opportunity to
increase staff-student inter i
participation is likely to be lost. The
apparently ideal columns of oar fortnight
- l y paper are perhaps not considered good
enough for this function, although i t
would be a great pity i f this attitude
prevailed. As an encouragement perhaps
the editor could invite some member of
staff to write an article of his own
choosing for each issue.
For anyone who is interested i n his
or her education, I should like to steal
another inch or two of your columns, to
publicise the proposed oonferenoa i.t ULU
on 'What are the Universities For?'
The conference w i l l consist of three
evening sessions, one per week, and one
two-day session in residence, as
follows!- .
1) To* 1 liar 6.00 p.m.
'She Nature of a University.'
This i s intended to set forward the idea
and ideal of a University and what i t
should be i n a l l i t s aspects.
2) Thu 10 Mar 6.00 p.m.
* The University Today.'
i) The "Varsity ' Community - Admin
and Finanoe.
U ) Teaching Methods,
i l l ) Syllabuses.
3) Tue t5 Mar
'The State, the Student and Sooiety.'
The residential conference will take
place at Wye College in Ashford, from
Sunday 24th April to Tuesday 26th April.
Sunday 6.00 p.m. The Responsibility
of the Student
Monday 10.00 a.m. The University and
the Commonwealth.
2.30 p.m. The University's
Obligations in a
Rapidly Changing
Distinguished speakera^nlve been
invited, and delegates from other
Universities will be invited to *fa>
resident session.
Perhaps we shall see some of the IC
staff attending! I sincerely hope so.

Dear Sir, ,
Having read with avid interest
your Editorial (Fri 2?th Nov.),
oonoerning the position of IC as
a University, College, I feel that some
aspects of the problem have been omitted,
giving a rather distorted position.
Certainly IC is one-sided, though I
believe that a largely technological
college produces more acceptable members
of the oommunity than a predominantly
Arts College. However, with over two
thousand students Imperial College
together with one or two other Colleges
in the University i s comparable i n size
with many provinoial Universities, and
i s big enough to be largely self-
contained within the network of University
activities. Apart from i t s variegated
membership, ULU i s comparable i n many
ways to the Unions of the major Colleges;
and I wonder how many people knew the
name of this year's President before
reading "Sennet" (sorry for including
that disturbing word!).
The University of London is unique,
because of i t s size, and the wide
separation of many of i t s Colleges, and
hence ULU ±a also a unique institution
whose functions should be just those with
which the College Unions cannot adequat-
ely deal. This should include the
organisation of inter-Collegiate
activities, catering for minority
interests, providing Union facilities
for the smaller Colleges, and a meeting
place far students of different faculties
where this cannot be achieved in the
Colleges concerned (i.e. at IC).
The restrictive attitude of the
so oalled IC elite is inevitable w,ith
so l i t t l e hostel accommodation, and
with the existence of the "Links"
"22", "Chaps" and other clubs, a
cliquish attitude w i l l exist, although
this i n itself i s not over much to worry
about since "Potential Leaders" i n the
College always seem concerned with such
cliques. It i s perhaps as well to
remember the words of the "BARd", "If
you're one of the boys and get drunk -
you're a good chap, but i f you're not
one of the boys and have had too much to
drink, you're a drunken idiot!"
Perhaps the greatest fault at IC
is that i t is the degree that matters,
and NOT the University education, so
that there are not enough people with
non-academic time to play with.
However, I do believe that anyone who
really wants a University education
can get i t at IC.
Yours,
A.N.Other.
B O Y C O T T
Sir.
When I consider my several follies
and those of my fellow human beings, I
doubt my sanity and theirs and despair
of the future of humanity.
Hut wheh I read Mr.Barber* s comment
on the Imperial College Union motion
about boycotting certain goods from
South Africa (published in FKLTX of
December 11th 1959) I was immediately
raised from depths of despondency to
heights of hope. In fact that hope
has survived into, the New Year and I
hope i t w i l l be happy.
Now we nitwits can s i t baok and
relax while wiie men like Mr.Barber
do the thinking and the talking for us.
We can say goodbye to Union meetings
and such old fashioned practices as
discussions. Democracy is after a l l
a relic of a byegone age .and must
yield to dictatorship which is th*
mare civilised.
We children (or Peter Pans
rather) are now waiting for Kike
Barber and the other "wise adults"
to produce the solution to
apartheid. Obviously a boycott i s
not merely childish but infantile. .
