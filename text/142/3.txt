I.C.W.A. has now passed the century
mark) and a% seems to me high time to
bring into the light of day the dreadful
truth about this organisation. It i s
not too much to etate that I.C.W.A. i s
a secret society, aiming* at the gradual
enslavement of the male population of
I.C. and the eventual establishment of
an Aaacon»autoeraay. This i s a grave
charge but the fasts are undeniable.
There own meetings are secret and what
bestial orgies are indulged i n no one
knows.
What first brought my'attention to
this danger in our midst, was the way i n
which many friends of mine have so aasi
easily succumbed to that most dangerous
of feminine wiles, I allude of. soursa to
oaffee. This tori«a« sai* ham
ensnared many Union Officials as wall at
many of the Hoi-Pollei. Cms tawed to
the I.C.W.A. floor, the poor fool i s
persuaded that his young hostess i s a
poor, innocent, defiaeelees l i t t l a ' g l r l
in a roaring mailstroa of hairy rugby
plsywus, 'Fibs ha*» -oft at* gute*
and ha immediately assumes an air of
paternal responsibility towards her.
She then uses all bar charm on the un-
fortunate bloke, and before long she i s
in a position to put words into his
mouth. He i s then, as our Colonial
friends would say, sunk. One mors
recruit to the ranks of the I.O.W.A.
philea. (Naturally the women prefer
to capture officers of the tftdon, but
any other fool will do as wall).
Being hooked, does he try to eeeapeT
He does not. Whyt For the simple
reason that he doesn't want to. He
is happy (he thinks).

Men of I.C..1
The time has now
oome for us to strike our blow for
freedom. We must resist these ..
feminine machinations, outlaw coffee
with I.C.W.A., clandestine visits to
the third f l o o r , and most of a l l , when
like the plague, that terrible
initiation • - swony, which degrades
beyond belief, the I.O.W.A. Formal.
The poison has spread throughout the
New Hostel. It must be confined
there. The Old Hostel, thank heaven,
is s t i l l a bastion of male supremacy
and presents a united front against
this dangerous female ideology.
There will we stand and fight, to the
last room, to the last man, to the
last Mooney sup.
One last word. This i s leap
year. On February 29th the women's
greatest attack will be launched,
tie must resist to the last. Men of
1.0. remember your forbears, those man
of mighty muscle and even mightier
capacity. Let not the memory of them
tads. Live up to your reputation.
Fight to the last.'

A report has reached us that an
Icwarian had her trousers removed in
crowded Oxford Street. The police
say that foul play i s not suspected.
After the recent happenings i n
Western Oermany, the cry of "Herr Ving,
for king" aecomapnied by a muted jack-
boot, will probably be echoing around
Europe soon.
We hear that when a certain
lecturer was asked f o r a syxlabus,
he said "I've only got a stapi i
motor oar". The funeral is next
Tuesday.
Another lecturer was asked it
he knew where Antwerp was. He
replied that there were -40 i n his
tutor!si group.
The funeral will be next Tues-
dsy.
