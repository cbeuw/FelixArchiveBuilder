The legislation wa3 finally passed
last year. As a result, from last week
no Bore non-whites may be admitted to
those Jfciversitiea. Instead, they will
have W attend segregated institutions
based on tribal conglomerations and set
in remote areas of the country. While
any eaa/iemioian' may doubt whether any*
thing but the most elementary infor-
mation could be communicated through a
tribal language, THE GOVERNKEM HAS LEFT
NOTHING TO CHANCE!

It surprised me to learn that the
there were any residual doubts on the
need for effeotive action against
Apartheid, There can certainly be no -
doubt^qf the unpleasantmess and evil of
the ideology of racial segregation
which lies behind i t . Perhaps,
however, there a few students in Britain
who s t i l l do not realise just how much
personal harm and ^dividual suffering
i t causes in the University spnere as
well as in a l l others.
As I write this, I cannot help
reflecting on the case of Mr. Gerald
Israeltam, one of the most recent viot-
laa of Apartheid to arrive in London,
he was lecturer in Botany at the-
Univarsity College of Port Hare. A
few months ago, he was told, without
any warning, that he,was to be dis-
missed from the staff of this allt J non-
white-oollege.. No reasons were given.
Later, the Minister of Bantu
education announced that he had dismissed
Mr. Israelstaa and several others ^in-
cluding two British citizens, Sir Pulque
Agnew, registrar, and his wife Lady
Agnew, who was head of the department
of Geography) because he "would not
allow a penny of the funds under his
control to be spent on persons sabota-
ging Apartheid". He stilludid not
speoify how this sabotage had been
perpetrated. But these three people
are now out of jobs, have left their
homes and sought voluntary exile here
in England.
Why? Because they see their dis-
missal not just as an isolated instance
of governmental invasion of University
freedom, but as part of a carefully
prepared plan to capture the minds of
the non-white people. Their bodies
must already be regarded as captive
through a plathara of restrictions on
movements, nousing, marriage, speech,
worship, employments and the absence of
parliamentary representation and the
ban on the right to strike - to name but
a few of the inevitable accompanimenta
of enforced segregation.
N E V I L L E R U B I N
Underlying a l l educational policy
and practice of Apartheid is the report
of the KISSELEN Commission on "Native
Education" which led to the Bantu
Eduoation Act i n 195k. Introducing
this, the present Prime Minister, (the
Minister of Native Affairs) told an a l l
whit* legislator that the purpose of
this education "was to ensure that for
the non-whites there is no.place in the
white society above the level of certain
forms of labour"
That policy has bean applied, a l l
schools for Africans had been segregated
in South Africa, so this was not simply
a question of introducing discrimination.
The purpose of the legislation was to
ensure that i t became a paraamaaft
feature of South African Society, and
that no African was brought up to think
differently. As a result the mission
schools were told that they must either
teach government syllabuses - including,
inter alia, a new course of "Race
Studies", and a "Social Studies" course
teaching tribal myths and glorifying a
tribal system whose powers were long
ago shattered by White Domination and
which is alien to the majority of the
millions of Africans now living in
cities -,ar to give uc their schools
So far more than 5,00© 'schools have been
"Taken-
Over" i n this way.
But even that was not enough. Two
of the Universities Xth« Universities of
Capetown and Witwaterarand) s t i l l remain
unsegrated, so the,government announced a
legislation to enforce the exclusion of
non-whites from these as well. The idea
was first mooted i n 1948. It was
resolutely opposed by a l l but a few of the
students and staff members involved, both
•hits and non-white. It was feufht by
,the majority of the .Univereities and even
severely criticised by those.academics
who had hitherto supported Asarthsid..
But the government went on with i t s plan.
It has alven itself the power to
appoint the College Councils, Senates,
and Staff Members; to estaDiish the
Criteria for the selection of students;
and to dismiss Staff Members (on a variety
of so-called "misconducts", one of whlcn
is criticism of the policy of adminift:
stration of the government) and this
applies not only to the new institutions,
but also to the already segregated
College of Port Hare.
Whatever 1960 may mean for British
students, i t looks as i f i t may mean the
end of a civilised education for Af ric
Africans in South Africa. The laws w
which have brought this situation; ahoa* .
were passed in the teeth of vigorous
opposition from South African students,
British and Commonwealth students,"and
those of 65 other countries. THE TIME
HAS NOW COME TO" TRANSLATE MERE VERBAL
OPPOSITION INTO MORE EFFECTIVE AND CON
CONCRETE TERMS.
