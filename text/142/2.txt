"Huis Clos" (Paris Pullman) 1* a
film about a journey into hall guided
by M. Jean Paul Sartre - down a
screaming liftshaft into? - an iaper-
0 nal hotsl.
The eharactars find themselves
In .a well furnished room with no
reflections in the mirror and orna-
ments that can't be moved. They
know no hunger, or physical pain.
They don't sleep. In this hell i s no
respite. Initially they fear
physically the impliments of torture -
but there are none. "There are
three of them, there will be no
more* remarks the servant,
A society woman (Qaby Silvia)
murderess of her unloved illegitimate
child. A revolutionary (Prank
Villard) a ooward who has betrayed his
friends and ignored the love of his
wife, and a lesbian (Arletty). The
balance is mathematical. It is
meant to be. They gradually realise
their helli 'L'enfer c'est lee
autres' - Hell i s other people.
The argument i s exciting but not ,
always clear (to me). I was almost
afraid at one point that 'Hell is
Truth1
- may bs i t i s .
I was glad when M. Sartre brought
us back.
Go and see Oaby Silvia - she'*

coward i n search of self respect and
Arletty with her big, savage, terrify-
ing, perverted eyes.

Don't miss the privilege of going
to hell with a return ticket.
Miracle films guided by the hand
of Ood (Brond's), shews us more of
Rodin's sculpture i n fifteen minutes
than fifteen days in Paris could do.
With Musi que Oonorete, inspired
camera work and lighting they givo us
the key to Rodin's hell and his sal-
vation. (Ourson)
Por those who admire the work of
J. P. Sart:-e, go to see "Savage Bye*
(Curion) and see what hell is really
like.
This film supports the continental
view that the americana are the most
cultured European people' Think what
you will of that, this film is american
and/but magnificent.
The thought history of a divorced
woman - Judith - her death her hell and
salvation told by her poet conscience .
and her own savage eye. This is l i f e
the way you prefer not to see i t and
its hell - 'And on the sixth day the
stars declined and the sun came up and
out of a handful1 of dirt, garbage and
alcohol Ood created man' - 'He made
a bad job of i t ' says Judith.
It should ehoek you - If you laugh
you are prokably frightened. Much
of the material i n the film is shot
straight from l i f e - so the impres-
sion is thare are no actors i n i t .
This is a horrible film poetio
and true. This really is the hell
jf contact of flesh of other people

Before criticism of the play can
he made i t must be remembered, however,
that the choice of play had to be made
in some haste. One month before open-
ing night, i t was learnt that the
permission could not be granted, for an
amateur company to produce the i n i t i a l l y
planned play "Liiard on the Rook".
aaa- always meant a great deal
more than merely story telling with
actions. It "Without the Prinee" by
Philip King is or ever has been oalled
drama, then I must certainly start to
revise my ideas. This play might just
as easily been entitled "A Han plays Ham1
'
or "Quips with the Vio", a farmhouse-
domestic oomedy that the Upper Hetherwiok
Dramatis Society might certainly attempt
to produce without seeming over-*
ambitious.
For cftiS reason, I reel that the
play i s particularly unsuitable for a
college protection which should be seme-
thing of historical, intellectual or
contemporary interest. "Without the
.Prlnoe" f u l f i l l s none of these fu&attoess
which i s especially disappointing as
there is obviously a not Inconsiderable
amount of talent at hand,
It i s difficult to single est any
particular performance from what was *
very~woll balanced cast, but, Carolyn
Russel as Emma Weatherhead created a
particularly strong impression acting
with a confidence and poise that
bettered many professional performances
that.I have seen.
John Peatherstone (Rev. Simone
Peters), David Cain (Kara Weatherhead),
Andrew Chalmers (P.C. James. Hawkins),
Terenoe Wright (Wyndham Jones), and
Gillian Harold (Mrs. Peters) a l l gave
attractive performances of the nature
that one has, by now, learnt to expect
whilst Sheila Burbidge. (Mary rfeather-
head), John Webb (Robert iVeatherhead)
and Brenda Tgplin (Madeleine Rees)
a l l acted adequately in parts that,
required l i t t l e i f any interpretat-
ion.
The set was quite convincingly des-
igned giving a good impression of the
traditional farmhouse scene*
Unfortunately lighting experts were
not given a great deal of scope.
Weather Forecast
Due to a strike i n the meteor-
ological office, there w i l l be no
weather over the south of England this
weekend.

On Sunday, January 10th, some
Polish students from Danzig, presented
their "Circus1
*, as they call It.
They had presented i t earlier at the
N.U.S, drama festival, though drama is
certainly not the word for what we
saw on Sunday. Laughs came fast and
furiously, at the Qoon-like antics of
the four performers (three men, one
woman). A quotation from the pro-
gramme will illustrate what I mean -
"Princes and Beggare.' After a tour
embracing Antwerp, Venice, Kangov er-
v i l l e , Valderma, Peckham Rye and Bottom
Rigis, your once famous circus again
appears before a native audience.
Here la the sad epilogue of our ,
wanderings -

his stupendous balancing act, has mar-
ried and fathered 5 children) the clowr

beloved horse Seeseg, you may care to

and so on.
It is possible that soon the show
may be put on again at I.C., i n which
case it's certainly worth seeing.
Although of course, there is the lan-
guage difficulty, one of the organisers
telle me, that i f the show is put on,
anA English translation of the songs
will be made, and announcements made
in English. To describe the various
acts would be impossible as the humour
is wholly visual. So and see i t .
