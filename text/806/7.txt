Festival E
y
e
The festival began in 1974 when a
bunch of people calling themselves
the Wallies turned up at Stonehenge
and camped there for a few day over
the Solstice, carrying out their rituals
and ceremonies. Their leader, Wally
Hope, was later admitted to a mental
hospital in rather suspicious
circumstances and died shortly
afterwards.
The next year, 1975, people came
back with Wally Hope's ashes and
ritually scattered them in the stones.
From that time the festival grew a
little each year until at its peak, in
1984, there were 30,000 people.
The original core consisted of
people with mystical or religious
views of what the stones and the
Solstice ceremony were about. But
the festival grew to take in more and
more people and gradually it turned
into a music festival and eventually
into a general-purpose gathering for
people of all types.
Another important development
was that it became a focus for the
New Travellers, a new travelling
culture unique to Britain, consisting
of young people who had decided to
escape the depressing environment of
the inner cities by going on the road.
Many of these people now have
children and a large proportion live
on the road all year. There are several
thousand New Travellers on the road
today.
Since 1985, attempts to re-establish
the Stonehenge People's Free Festival
have led to several confrontations
with police.
In 1986, at Stoney Cross in the
New Forest, several hundred
travellers were evicted and their
vehicles impounded, for trivial faults
in many cases. The travellers
marched to Glastonbury, where
Michael Eavis, promoter of the CND
festival and owner of Worthy Farm,
allowed them to stay. Two weeks
later, a different group consisting of
several hundred walkers from cities
and towns was arrested on the eve of
the Solstice as it tried to reach
Stonehenge. Despite all this, several
hundred people turned up at
Stonehenge for the Solstice dawn.
Last year, most travellers took a
year off and went to Glastonbury
festival instead. There, in two fields
on the edge of the CND festival, the
spirit of Stonehenge was
unmistakeable. However, the year's
major success was that several
hundred walkers spent two weeks in
Wiltshire on a mobile festival that
became an amazing, and spiritual,
travelling party.
It is the walkers who are likely to
have the easiest time this year
because, unlike people with trucks,
they are not affected by the new anti-
The Stongehenge Festival of 1984
hippy law: Section 39 of the Public
Order Act. Already groups of walkers
have left from London, Coventry,
Bristol, Aberystwyth and
Southampton (for details ring 0686
848835). This weekend there will be
a big party at Calleva Roman Town,
near Silchester.
The view of the Stonehenge
Campaign is that it will be the power
of the walkers that will re-establish
the Stonehenge festival by convincing
the authorities that it will be easier to
allow the festival to happen than to
spend millions of pounds each year
trying to stop it.
And even if the walkers fail, they'll
have a lot of fun doing it. See you
there!
