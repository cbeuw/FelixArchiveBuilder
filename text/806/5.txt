FELIX
Tired! Jaded! Exams just too much!
Time out! Relax
Share and enjoy the Imperial Colle^
and Science Museum Summer Fair
Extravaganza 1988. Easily identified
by the huge striped pagodas, wafting
smells of hamburgers cooking, steam
engines steaming(l), popcorn being
popped and relish being relished on
the Queen's Lawn on Father's Day
Sunday 19, June.
You will not have seen a more
wonderous site on Queen's Lawn.
Heralded by a brass band the Fair will
commence at 2.30pm. Glass blowing,
vintage motorcars, bizarre motorcars,
a real steam train and other various
modes of conveyance! Not for those
average cuts, grazes and contusions
a London Emergency Ambulance will
be on campus, together with a vintage
ambulance. Are you a Top Gun? Try
out Aeronautic's Flight Simulator.
How high can you jump? Geoff
Parsons, poised for Seoul, will show
you how to jump higher and higher
and higher! Not as high as the
Queen's Tower which will be open
and free.
For the very first time you will be
able to see real medics (in the flesh!)
from St Mary's Hospital Medical
School who will show us what they
are made of, or more accurately, what
we are made of, in their Rocky
Horror Pathology Show. Out, Out
damned spot! Blood grouping
while-you-wait.
All of you who have not yet
suffered the humiliation of dragging
a kicking and crying child out of
Launch Pad unwilling to leave can
now have that chance. At 5.45pm the
Science Museum have scheduled a
Special Private Viewing of the hands-
on exploratorium—Launch Pad.
Designed to accommodate an end-
of-term dwindling grant all ice-cream,
popcorn and punch are all included
in the price of a natty admission badge
at £2.50. Where else could you get
all this and a trendy fashion accessory
too?
Children's charities will profit by
our profits—ICAN (Invalid Childrens
Aid Nationwide); St Mary's Open
Clinic for underprivileged B&B
children; the College Nursery and the
Wishing Well Appeal for Great
Ormond Street Childrens Hospital. So
the more money you put in, the more
money they get out!
Everyone gets involved! Why
should you be the exception?
Cookery Club
I hope you have enjoyed reading the
food column as much as I have loved
writing it. A surprising amount of
background consultation goes into
each article. This week I would like
to acknowledge the help received
from Alison Metcalfe and Valeria
Arrighi. I was unable to get you any
hot foodie tips on eating in Rome and
Florence.
If there is not enough food for
thought this week you are in for a
gastronomic climax when I make a
mystical journey from the heights of
Mughalai cuisine through to the
arousing dishes of vegetarian India.
Mama Italia
Verona
Regional culinary specialities are
worth trying in preference to anything
else that might be available in the
region being visited. The hardened
gastronomic traveller values any
knowledge about such specialities at
a premium. Two culinary
masterpieces from Verona which
must be tried at all costs are:
Polenta—made from maize flower. A
porton of polenta is eaten with either
rabbit or hare or baccala (dried salted
cod) or soppressa (a special Italian
salami) bathed in a flavoursome
tomato sauce.
Lesso—served together with 'Peara'.
Lesso is made by boiling chicken or
beef or cotechino (an Italian sausage)
or a mixture of these and is served
together with the peara, a sauce made
from graded bread and marrow
cooked in broth.
Valeria recommends strongly that
you drink a red wine with these
regional favourites.
Rome
Foodie Rome was one of the palatable
highlights of my visit to Italy last
year. The food tips I received turned
out to be gems. I made a brief
departure from the world of trattorias.
There was the novelty of going to a
restaurant serving a multi-course
surprise menu, still more refreshing
was a visit to the 'Cul-de-Sac' an
unusual establishment specialising in
cold meals. The main room doubled
up as a wine cellar with wine bottles
lining the walls from floor to ceiling.
The atmosphere was more on having
a good chat with friends over several
bottles of wine, the food being quite
secondary, I cannot remember the
area of Rome where these gems are
located.
I will whole-heartedly recommend
the ice-cream parlour immediately
opposite the Parliament Building.
Once you set foot in it you will sense
that you will be treated to a wide
choice of home-made icecream.
A day out of Rome
Those of you who have a day to spare
should take a train from Roma
Termini to Bracciano, a town located
on an inland lake. Quite apart from
the scenery the food is claimed to be
very good, and the wine flowing in
abundance. This is supposed to be a
favourite haunt of soldiers serving in
the Army Barracks near by.
Uncle Sam
I remember going for a meal in the
resort island of Block Island, Rhode
Island. A scallop starter, a pan
blackened halibut main course, a
cheesecake dessert washed down with
a sea-breeze (a cocktail) cost an earth
shattering £45. That was three years
ago when the dollar was not so weak.
This experience aside, America is not
an expensive place to eat and there is
plenty of opportunity for trying the
unusual.
Philadelphia
Pat Steaks (near Passayunk Av) is
open 24 hours a day. It is well known
in the city for its 'Hoagies'. A hoagie
is a type of sandwich that is an
institution in this city.
The Frog/Commissary (1710 Sansom
St) has been recommended. The Frog
has an informal atmosphere. A large
American salad, a pumpkin cheese
cake and a beer will cost about £10.
A meal in the Commisary will come
to about £20 a head.
Bookbinders!! Restaurant should be
tried for good seafood.
Washington DC
The whole of the Baltimore area is
famous for its soft shell crabs. Keep
a look out for the availability of this
delicacy which has a very short
season.
Maine/Cape Cod
The lobsters found here are world
famous. You will normally have a
choice whether to try boiled or stuffed
baked lobster. I have not met anyone
who prefers the latter.
I had never eaten a lobster until I
went to the States. The flesh of a
freshly boiled lobster must figure in
my top ten gastronomic experiences.
I remember picking up the live
lobsters and taking them back home.
The claws have rubber bands
clamping the claws shut.
Unfortunately, rubber bands have to
be removed otherwise they give an
unpleasant odour when boiled. The
trick is to remove the rubber band
from the larger claw first because this
claw is more clumsy than its nippy
smaller brother. Try not to lose a
finger if you end up having to grapple
with live lobsters like I did.
California
The 'Hog's Breath Inn' in Carmel was
recommended specially. There might
also be the odd chance of running into
Clint Eastwood who owns the inn.
Boston
The Oyster House cannot be missed
by anyone who enjoys eating oysters.
Silver Springs (Maryland)
Mrs K's Tollhouse in Silver Springs
is a must for anyone passing through
this town.
Special Points
The casinos in Las Vegas serve cheap
meals as a way of attracting more
people into the casinos so do not miss
out under the impression that things
will be expensive. The casinos in
Atlantic City do not run on the same
principle but the Golden Nugget
casino serves cheap 'all you can eat'
dinners.
It is mean not to give the waiter at
least a 15 % tip on the cost of a meal.
The taxman always assumes that
waiting personnel are tipped at that
level when trying to assess taxable
income.
Bye for now, Yishu.
