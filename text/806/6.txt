Earlier this year,
on March 25th, a
group of people
calling themselves
the Stonehenge
Campaign wrote to
the Minister for
Defence asking for
a piece of land on
which to hold the
1988 Stonehenge
People's Free
Festival. The
Minister said no.
The equinox (21st March) gathering this year
Three years ago a similar request was
made which was also turned down.
Then, a few weeks later, on June 1st
1985, police attacked a group of 550
travellers who were on their way to
start that year's festival. That incident
has gone down in the travellers'
folklore as the "Battle of the
Beanfield"; it has gone into the
history books as the largest mass
arrest of civilians in the UK since the
1700s, and as a milestone in public
order policing.
Ever since, the campaign to
publicise the injustice and to re-
establish a Soltice gathering at
Stonehenge has grown year by year.
The actions of the police at the
Battle of the Beanfield were a wholly
inappropriate response to the situation
A small festival taking place in the run-up to Stonehenge 1987
that existed. The police had assumed
that they would be dealing with a
bunch of thugs out for a fight, and had
formulated their strategy accordingly.
In fact, they were dealing with several
hundred travelling families who had
brought with them their possessions,
their homes and their children.
What happened that day shocked
many people. It shocked the
journalists who were there and who
tried to interfere when they realised
what was going on. It shocked the
Earl of Cardigan who had tagged
along with the travellers because they
had camped the night on his land. It
shocked television viewers when film
of what had happened was broadcast
on national television news that
evening.
Condemnation of the police action
followed: from the National Council
for Civil Liberties (NCCL), from the
Police Complaints Authority (PCA)
and from many other organisations
and individuals. In March last year,
the PCA report on the Beanfield said
that "excessive force" was used and
that prisoners at Amesbury Police
Station were not treated correctly.
Charges against those arrested on
June 1st 1985 were subsequently
dropped.
The latest development is many of
the people arrested that day have
issued writs against Wiltshire's Chief
Constable Donald Smith claiming
wrongful arrest, imprisonment,
assault and damage to property.
Despite the police action on June
1st 1985, festival-goers continue to
risk arrest, imprisonment and damage
to their property for the sake of a
Solstice gathering at Stonehenge.
Why? This is not an easy question to
answer. The Stonehenge Free Festival
meant different things to different
people. Here is one person's view:
' 'People used to come from all over
the country to be together; we didn't
all know each other but we were all
behaving as though we'd known each
other for a long time.
There was an immediacy about the
festival, an immediacy of
communication that you get nowhere
else—not in towns, not in cities.
The last few Stonehenge festivals
were vast and you'd find things going
on in every corner of the site—music,
dance, clowns,fire-eaters,jugglers.
You'd get maybe seven or eight small
stages as well as the main stage.
And then there was 'Tibet', the
Tibetian Ukrainian Mountain Troupe
(nothing to do with Tibet or the
Ukraine!) who were a sort of
travelling circus. They used to set
themselves up somewhere and do all
sorts of wonderful things. "
