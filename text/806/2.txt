FELIX
Yet another nail in Imperial's coffin
as they raise the College rents even
higher than we could have ever
imagined. College don't seem to do
any sort of long-term thinking when
they think of short-term solutions to
their financial problems. To any
moron with half an iota of intelligence
it is clear that IC has priced itself out
of the market. How many potential
students will not consider going to a
London College because they have no
money left to spend after paying their
rent bill? And they wonder why the
applications are falling!
Welfare Adviser
There's a movement growing in the
Union which would like to see a new
Welfare Adviser appointed and placed
in the Union Building as a Union
service. This would be the best news
of the year if it actually happened,
especially as I'm told that College
don't plan to appoint a Welfare
Adviser again.
Motor Rally
Due to circumstances beyond my
control. I've had to cancel the Annual
FELIX Motor Rally this year, sorry
to everybody who had got together a
team for this event.

The Oaks on Saturday saw a class
horse win in style. The favourite
Dimimendo came home by six lengths
to defeat the late run of Sudden Love
to give the Epsom crowds a treat. He
was always in the front crowd and on
turning Tattenham Corner, left the
crowd and headed for home. No other
horse had a chance from this point.
Sudden Love went with him but
couldn't find the pace of the champion
and was clear second in front of the
well finisning FrenchfillyAnamasce.
The other big news in racing was
the announcement that champion
jockey Lester Piggot is to be stripped
of his OBE. Piggot. who is serving
a three year sentence for tax evasion,
was awarded the honour in 1975 after
riding his twentieth classic winner.
Downing Street said of the incident:
'It is quite usual in cases where an
honoured person is jailed.' Piggott is
said to be very upset at the news.
On a brighter note, thefirstrounds
of the greyhound derby have now
been run, and among the highlights
were the impressive victories of Sam
Bridge. Carrinberry and Stake
Whisper. I am. however, sticking
with Killoughreigh Chris, who,
despite badly bruising a toe in his heat
on Saturday, still ran to gain third
place and an entry into round two.
This only goes to show his class. He
is now 50-1 and this is a great chance
for a big win.
Other highlights of the week
by Martin Peck
include the five length victory of
Samhaan at Yarmouth on Tuesday,
and he looks set to run in the
Bessborough Handicap at Royal
Ascot next week. There he will meet
Qannaas. one of Tom Jones' horses,
who won recently at Sandown. Jones
will also run lnaad in the Royal Hunt
Cup. Habub in the King George and
Al Mych in the Sussex Stakes. The
latter ran poorly in the Derby but is
expected to run well in this race.
The big races at Ascot are the
Queen Anne Stakes, the Gold Cup
and the Coronation Stakes all of
which look like being fantastic races.
The Queen Anne has last year's
Sussex winner Soviet Star facing the
Rogers Gold Cup second, Fair
Judgement with the French Champion
Andre Fabre also in with a chance.
Meanwhile Wednesday's Coronation
Stakes will see One Thousand
Guineas winner Ravinella back in
Action, but facing tough opposition
from Irish One Thousand Guineas
third Trusted Partner. The best
competition promises to be the Ascot
Gold Cup on Thursday. France will
hope for victory with Royal Gait and
Salco looking very strong, but they
are faced with the might of recent
winner El Conquestador, who will
also run with stablemate Sadeem as
a pacemaker. All in all it promises to
be a great racing week, and my tips
for the event are Ravinella, Royal
Gait, Al Mych and Soviet Star.
