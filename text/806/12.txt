for their rooms instead of receiving
rent-free accommodation in order to
save more money. The position of
sub-wardens was heavily debated by
the Students Residence Committee
and it was decided that the subwarden
situation would remain unchanged.
Another suggestion which was
rejected by the Committee was the
idea to suspend the internal
redecoration programme entirely for
year which promised a saving of
around £80.000.
The College Finance Section has
decided to start charging students a
handling charge if they wish to pay
their rent in instalments rather than
termly. At the moment any student
can pay by instalments at no extra cost
but, starting from the next session,
students will be charged an extra £3
per instalment. They have also
decided to charge any student who
bounces a rent cheque a penalty of £5.
Currently students are charged £15
if they do not pay their rent bill within
ten days. Next year, if a student fails
to pay his account for whatever
reason within ten day's of the bill's
issue, they will be charged £1 per
working day starting from the
overdue date.
College Assistant Finance Officer
Malcolm Aldridge told FELIX that
the present system was being abused
and that his staff had 'an
uncomfortable amount of discretion'
when dealing with hard luck stories.
The new rules could be strictly
adhered to and 'hard luck stories will
not be listened to.'
Health Centre
charges to be
scrapped
The Health Centre charge of £ 4 per
term v/hich is levied on College
accommodation bills is to be
abolished next session. This move has
been made possible as the Centre has
managed to secure alternative funning
from the Department of Health and
Social Security. .

Human
Rights go
The motion on Human Rights Week,
brainchild of Simon Bosher,
submitted by ICU was passed by
GUC on 7th June. The motion states
that Imperial has started work on a
high-profile Human Rights Week to
be held from 6th to 12th February
1989 and mandates the G U C
Executive to give its full support to
the committee organising the week.
Amnesty International. Anti-
Apartheid, the NUS (London) and the
TUC are among the groups which are
to be asked to support the Human
Rights Week officially.
It was agreed that Imperial should
act as the major host for the
'University of London Human Rights
Week'. However the item 'GUC
believes...that Imperial College are
very nice hard working people who
are not a bunch of right-wing
fascists!' was objected to and dropped
from the motion.

Sploshed!
The Union Manager. David Peacock,
was drenched last Monday evening,
when water was dropped on him
'from a great height'. The incident
occurred at approximately 5.45pm
outside Beit Arch.
Mr Peacock was particularly
annoyed because he had only just had
his jacket dry-cleaned. College Chief
Security Officer, Geoff Reeves, is
appealing for witnesses to come
forward.
The attack is in a similar vein to one
inflicted on Internal Services Officer,
Al Birch, four weeks ago. It was
thought, at the time, that The
Phantom Soaker was once again
prowling College. The japester scored
over fifty hits at College two years
ago. Mr Reeves told FELIX that he
didn't feel that this is the work of the
original Phantom Soaker as he'd
'probably left College by now'.
Alan Rose is 23.
