Judo Club.
It was an individuals competition,

to do very well, especially with a
number of its key players unable to
compete because of exams. However,
after a long hard day of fighting,
tension and nerves, we did come
away with a total of four medals,
these were:
Gold—Elizabeth Moore, ICJC
(Women's Middleweight)
Silver-David Phillips, UCLJC
(Men's Heavyweight)
Bronze—Wendy Howden, ICJC
(Women's Light-Middleweight)
Bronze—Yoke-Foong Tan, ICJC
(Women's Bantamweight)
All placed medallists from this
competition are entitled to enter the
National Finals at the end of the year,
though right now no one seems to
want to think about another major
competition.
It had been a long day for everyone,
beginning with the weigh-ins at
8.45am. and not finishing until the
finals at around 5.30pm. The London
University contingent managed to
keep their spirits high and were
suitably rewarded at the presentation
ceremony—and also by the unusual
event of the IC Judo coach (albeit a
happy one) buying a generous round
at ULU that evening!
