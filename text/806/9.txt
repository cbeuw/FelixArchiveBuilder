Suspect (Cert 15)
Justice Lowell has blown his brains
out with a shot gun. Elizabeth Quinn,
a secretary in the Justice Department,
is found floating in the Potomac. Are
the crimes related? Who can we pin
them on before Christmas comes to
Washington DC?
The most likely candidate is a
Vietnam veteran, Carl Anderson
(Liam Neeson, A Prayer for the
Dying), who is almost superficially
charged and locked up. Enter Cher
(Moonstruck, Silkwood) as public
defender Kathleen Riley, appointed as
the obligatory non-committal
attorney. Good attorneys are not non-
committal though, and Cher doesn't
let us down.
Next to join in is Judge Helms,
played by John Mahoney. His
problem is that he has no time for this
case and makes it quite obvious that
he thinks Anderson is guilty and
ought t& be fried for the murder. Or
perhaps that is Anderson's problem.
It certainly isn't his only one though,
because he is also deaf and dumb,
which makes defending him very
difficult.
There is only one thing standing in
the way of a quick guilty verdict, and
that is Dennis Quaid (Innerspace). He
plays Eddie Sanger, a lobbyist from
Capitol Hill, and one of the jury
members. Sanger turns detective and
begins hunting out evidence to prove
Anderson's innocence, passing it on
to Riley, and thereby breaking the
law.
Why should he do this? Well I
couldn't work it out. Sanger mutters
something about conscience but gives
no real explanation. It makes the plot
a little thicker if nothing else, and puts
the tiniest amount of tension in what
would otherwise be a fairly tedious
affair.
The trial continues, or rather it
drags a bit, but eventually we reach
the end and suddenly the twist in the
tale jumps out. I was certainly caught
by surprise, even though it stands out
like a sore thumb in retrospect.
Suspect is not a bad film, but it ist, i
quite complete in many respects.
Perhaps the best way to describe it is
'an almost movie'. It tries to do a lot
of things but never quite manages any
of them.
As a thriller, the only element
which is missing is the thrill, which
is fairly essential. As a vehicle for
Cher, well, Moonstruck is streets
ahead there. As a banner for social
statement—Vietnam and the
homeless, the fundamental failures of
the American Dream—the movie runs
out of steam there, since in every case
the point is briefly mentioned and
quickly forgotten.
Despite this failure to fulfill its
quota of movie requirements Suspect
does have enough addictiveness to
hold attention and keep you
wondering just what is actually going
on. Perhaps that's what really counts.
If you just want to watch Cher, then
go and see Moonstruck. If it's Dennis
Quaid you like then Innerspace
should be out on video by now. And
if you only want to see a thriller, No
Way Out and Someone to Watch Over
Me are still around, and far superior.
If you've done all that and you just
want to escape exams, and you don't
expect too much, well Suspect is on
in the West End now, and is just about
worth seeing.

Bright Lights, Big City
(Cert 18}
Bright Lights, Big City is based on a
Jay Mclnvernay novel, and stars
Michael J Fox, who acts quite well,
proving he has, at last graduated from
the Brat Pack 'trashy' film set.
Fox plays Jamie Conway, who
works for the prestigious New York
'Gotham Magazine', in the
department of Factual Verification,
under the eagle-eye of ever-accurate
Clara Tillinghurst and boss Mr
Vogler (excellently played by Frances
Sternhagan and John Houseman).
Jamie finds himself unsettled by his
mother's death from cancer (Diane
Wiest) and the desertion of his
beautiful wife Amanda (Phoebe
Cates), neither of which he can
accept.
This combination increases Jamie's
dependence on drink and cocaine, and
thus begins the worst week of his life.
This starts with being fired for
screwing up a report in work. Things
get worse from here on in. His best
friend yuppie executive Tad Alagash
(Keifer Sutherland), tries to help by
leading Jamie around the drink and
drug soaked nightlife of yuppie New
York.
Things come to a head when
Amanda comes to town and the
anniversary of his mother's death
comes near. However there is light
at the end of the tunnel, in the form
of Megan (Swoozie Kurtz) and Tad's
cousin Vicky (Tracy Pollen), who
give him the understanding he needs.
The film is very compelling and has
a good plot. The whole cast act very
well and help show James Bridges to
be a class director. Also impressive
are the scenes and locations including
discos and fashion shows and lots of
good music including New Order,
Prince, MARRS and Konk make the
film very entertaining.
The film has a bit of everything
(except a car chase) from emotion to
put a lump in your throat, to funny
scenes to make you laugh.
After, undoubtedly Fox's best
performance to date, I am left with
the notion that, after a hard day at the
bar and an even harder night at the
club Michael J Fox might have grown
even the tinniest bit of stubble! But
no!! (Who am I to talk?)
Nevertheless those of you who
thought he was just an annoying
precocious turkey might not change
your mind, but you will see some
talent.
