IC rents rocket
through the roof
Rents are set to rise drastically again next year following a meeting
of the Students Residence Committee on Wednesday. The latest
increase is equivalent to a rise of 5% plus an additional £2.50 across
the board on all College accommodation. In an attempt to reduce a
deficit of around £100,000 from the College Residence Account, College
will also be charging students for one extra week in accommodation
over the Christmas vacation.
College Assistant Finance Officer
Malcolm Aldridge explained to
FELIX yesterday that next year's
rents were increased by the smallest
amount possible and that the College
Finance Sub-committee would have
liked to have made the rises bigger.
The only thing which kept the
increase at 5% plus £ 2 . 5 0 was that it
had been agreed to with last year's
ICU President Christine Taig and they
didn't want to breach faith with the
students' union. Rents are set to rise
by inflation plus £1.83 in the 1989/90
as part of this agreement.
The new rents are shown in the
table, although these figures are still
subject to rounding and, in a few
cases, to further up-rating if
improvements have been carried out
on the property over the Summer.
The Residence Account currently
has a deficit of £ 1 6 5 , 0 0 0 but Mr
Aldridge believes that the real deficit
is currently running at £100,000 p.a.
for the next two or three years. Most
of the debt was built up when the new
hall in Evelyn Gardens was not
completed in time and £120,000 was
lost in rent revenue because of this.
The College Finance Sub-group
came up with several ways to save
£ 100.000 a year which it put forward
to the Students Residence Committee
for consideration. Of the suggestions
put forward, it was decided that
students should have to pay one
week's rent over the Christmas period
rather than letting out rooms for
conferences during that time.
Mr Aldridge said that charging
students over the Christmas vacation
would correspond with the normal
practice in the private sector.
Although this means around an extra
£35 per year per student, the extra
income generated will only be in the
region of £20,000.
A further saving that the Student
Residence Committee has agreed to
is the charge of a greater rent to
students who live in College
accommodation over the long
vacations for reasons other than
academic ones. The increased rents
will be calculated as two-thirds of the
difference between the term-time
weekly rent and the conference
weekly rate.
It was suggested by College
administration that either the number
of sub-wardens should be reduced or
they should be made to pay half-rent
