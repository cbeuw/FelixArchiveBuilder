Songs, Blackouts
and Beasts
Somewhere near half past ten last Sunday evening the old
tradition of singing in the Beit Quadrangle was once again per-
formed to the noticeable delight of the appreciative Beit residents.
Although the show got off to a s h a k y s t a r t with a mixed key
version o f " A u l d L a n g S y n e " the enthusiasm was regenerated
by the " K a n g a l a " . It was obvious that this melody had been w e l l
rehearsed and was delivered i n strong harmony with a good treble.
" G o d Save T h e Q u e e n " lacked something of the inspiring anthem
that i t ' s meant to be. Maybe the bass w a s a bit off. T h e concert
ended to my displeasure, with the c l a s s i c aria, " A m e r i c a n P i e " ,
and a l l twenty odd soloists singing at once.
I would like to have heard the R . C S . (Royal Choral Singers ?)
Messiah from Scrap or even a D e l t a B l u e s with Bottle N e c k .
The Quad lighting was poor and so I unfortunately m i s s e d the
square dancing.
E v e r tried a blackout! It seems to be a new fashion. Once
popular in war time, it i s only recently that it has been put to
good effect.
One example of note resulted in one of the most incoherent and
dramatic evenings Dave Haddon has ever had.
The occasion was at a certain notorious " H o u s e - w a r m i n g " party
last Saturday.
The amazing thing i s that he d i d not seem totally aware of what
he was doing.
" Y e s , I'm f i n e " . H e s a i d , confused when he saw the ambulance
driver.
The c l i m a x was: Dave was put to bed by a young lady whose
name I am not free to announce just yet. (i.e. H e can't remember
who it was).
Has Dr. F . H . Berkshire ever considered imaginary paper cups
I wonder. It can almost be proven that 5 i s a perfect number in the
system of "Mathematical B e a s t s " .
If interested please contact the F e l i x Office on Thursday even-
