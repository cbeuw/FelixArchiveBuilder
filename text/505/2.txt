Dear Editor, - I noticed, with
horror, that the F E L I X dinner
is this year to be held in the
" E l V i n o " restaurant in F l e e t
Street.
E l V i n o ' s have a discrimina-
tory practice against women in
not allowing women to be served
in the bar.
A woman journalist took the
management to court, with the
help of the E q u a l Opportunities
Commission. The case was one of
the most farcical in the history
of the Sex Discrimination Act.
The management claimed that
the rule had been brought in be-
cause allowing women to sit on
stools by the bar had meant that
their handbags had caused
congestion.
The judge s a i d the management
did not intend the rule to be dero-
gatory, that there was a lack of
inferior service and that it was
only a matter of courtesy as
" b e i n g served at the bar would
expose a person to the risk of
being pushed or j o s t l e d " . The
final insult was the judges find-
ing that the case was De Minimus,
i.e. too trivial to bother with.
The E.O.C- could not afford
to take the case to the High Court,
so unfortunately it has been left.
The least that people can do
who are concerned about womens'
rights is to boycott the restau-
rant, which I hope F E L I X readers
w i l l do.
Yours anti-discriminatorily,
Mary Attenborough

Ents Chairman
Resigns
At an Ents meeting last Mon -
day, there was a vote of no con-
fidence in Bob Morrison, the Ents
Chairman .There were 25 people
at the meeting.
The two new acting Chairmen
are Andy Warne and Chris Cha -
jecki and elections will be held
in two w e e k s .
Ents plan to hold two concerts
in the Concert Hall featuring
After The Fire and Punishment
of Luxury. The Great Hall will
probably be used for a concert
on March 3rd with U K .
Dear Sir, - On Saturday 6 th Jan-
uary, I bought a fountain pen at
Barkers on Kensington High
Street. It turned out to be faulty,
but when I took it back, Barkers
refused to replace it, in direct
contravention of the Supply of
Goods (Implied Terms) A c t 1973.
The assistant manageress of
the stationary department told me
company policy would not let her
offer me a replacement, although
she would send it back to the
manufacturers under guarantee, if
I wanted to wait five weeks.
I can only hope that other stu-
dents at I.C' do not suffer the
same treatment, if they still
choose to go there.
Yours faithfully,
J . Robinson
Dear Sir, - I read with interest
an article published in your last
edition which informed us that
refectory prices had risen due to
a rise of 1.9% in the F i n a n c i a l
Times Index. I had thought that
the F . T . Index was related to
city share prices and fail to
understand what bearing this
could have on food prices in our
refectories. Perhaps someone
could enlighten me on this mattes
Yours faithfully,
F . Bongolia
Eds Note - The refectory prices
are linked to the Financial Times
Retail Price Index NOT the Fin-
ancial Times Share Index which,
as you say, is linked to the City
Shares.

Dear Sir, - In the latter half of the
Christmas term I.C. M u s i c Socie-
ty presented no fewer than four
concerts, three of an orchestral
nature and one choral. Approxi-
mately 320 musicians took part
in these concerts and almost 1000
people attended as members of
the various audiences. The maj-
ority of these people have access
to the college newspaper and
would be interested to see a re-
view of these concerts, and yet
the producers of F e l i x make no
attempt to provide coverage in
any form. In one case the Society
even made arrangements for a
review to be written and present-
ed, and yet it was not published.
The Music Society has probably
the largest active membership of
all the college clubs. We do not
demand week by week accounts
of our activities, but simply ask
for printing space as and when we
give concerts. Nor should it be
necessary for the Society to
arrange their own critics - are a l l
the F e l i x minions so narrow mind-
ed that no suitable reviewer can
be found?
It i s time that F e l i x adopted a
realistic attitude to music at
Imperial and stopped revolving
around the interests of the few
students who produce the paper!
