U F O S In New Zealand r
Pictures of U F O S taken from a freighter
aircraft south of Wellington, New Zealand,
on the 30th December were shown on tele - I
vision around the world to-day.1 The film

suggestions that they were either sightings
of the moon or a reflection of one of the
planets.

nomer, said "I think it is deplorable that
whenever people s e e something in the heaven
they don't recognise, they think it has some
fantastic o r i g i n " .

Computer analysis of music
Prof. Richard V o s s , of the IBM research
centre at Yorktown Heights, New York
claims that he has discovered the precise
relationship of musical notes that makes
the difference between good music and bad,
irrespective of what type of music it i s .
He has experimented with every type of
music from Bach to Rock and has found the
answer to the ancient question "What does
music imitate?"
According to h i s theory, it imitates our
subconscious longing to observe the process
of change.
Just a s we admire a fast moving story in a
novel, so in good music the notes must be
unpredictable but closely-related.
The achievements of successful musical
composers through the ages and perhaps
also of good story tellers i s to have d i s c o v -
ered subconciously these subtle sequences.
