How to Survive the Gold
an introduction to ICU
It was very good news that college i s back to work following the
agreement with A . S . T . M . S . Now a l l you need worry about i s free-
zing in lectures (if you manage to get into them due to the rail
strike) owing to the fuel shortage. If you do get too c o l d you can
always nip up to the union office (which i s very warm).
W E L F A R E D A Y
Just to prove that the union carries on against a l l odds we are
organising a Welfare Day on Wednesday January 31st 12.30 onwards
in the Junior Common Room. There are d i s c u s s i o n s planned on
topics such a s ; Consumer Rights,for which we have invited the
Consumers A s s o c i a t i o n and West London County Court (to explain
the small claims procedure), H o u s i n g rights,for which Shelter H o u -
sing A i d Centre has been invited, P o l i c e and the law, for which the
local police and Release have been invited, S o c i a l Security,for
which the Department of Health and S o c i a l Security have been
invited (to explain their excessive bureaucracy) etc. etc. etc.
The Welfare Centre w i l l be there as w e l l as the Health Centre
and the Student Counsellor.
B E E R
If you think that you have no problems and are never l i k e l y to have
any you can s t i l l go to Welfare Day to get some free beer although
one thing that must interest everybody (except us lucky research
students) is exam, study technique, which Dr. H a i n e s , the Health
Centre Director, is an expert on and has agreed to do a talk.
S E X
If you aren't interested in beer or exams, you must be interested
in sex. There w i l l also be information on contraception provided by
the F a m i l y P l a n n i n g A s s o c i a t i o n and abortion by the B r i t i s h P r e g -
nancy Advisory Service to say nothing of the controversial sex
education film " G r o w i n g U p " . A l l this and some s i l l y games too !
(relay teams needed for condom blowing competition - apply to
Union Office for details)
Union Meeting
Don't forget is on Tuesday at 1.00pm in the Great H a l l . Among
motions on the agenda are Iran and Housing (concerning such
issues as head tenancy schemes).
Industrial Society
T h i s is a national Society to extend information on industry and
has 15,000 member organisations including industrial and commer -
c i a l companies, trade unions, nationalised industries, central
and l o c a l government organizations and employers a s s o c i a t i o n s .
The Society has eleven student societies and would like to e s t a -
b l i s h one at Imperial. It would be a great help in getting information
on various career prospects and other aspects of life outside.
C o u l d anyone interested in setting up such a society please contact
me or Sheyne L u c o c k , External Affairs Officer.(who I am trying to
pass the buck to).

A n Historic City
How did you spend your time yesterday, can you remember?
It was a Tuesday and below freezing point in London. She had
been half an hour late in meeting him, but the wait had been worth-
while for her dark shining hair was perfection and in any case, the
thought of being stood up had been too awful to contemplate.
He had brought a camera, and after a meal together took pictures
of her in B r u n s w i c k Square. They had not known each other long,
and now, as he studied her face for the best profile, the right expre -
s s i o n , he realized just how different she had seemed i n the light of
the gas fire as they had snuggled c l o s e l y together. That night, whe -
ther due to the light or, perhaps, mental a s s o c i a t i o n , she had seemed
the perfect image of a former girlfriend.
They caught the tube so as to spend the last hour together which
they spent strolling around Regents Park. It was so picturesque. Ice
covered the lake, and the cold drew their frozen bodies together for
warmth. P a s s i n g through iron gates, they climbed a knoll and sat
down. London sprawled before them.
Her voice assured him that they would meet again, and feeling
better he rested his head on her shoulder. She felt compelled to
remain p a s s i v e .
Days later their respective terms would start. For him it would be
a B S c . at Imperial, and for her a B A in French at Dumam. Their
lives contained different friends, different opportunities, different
hardships. What had made them choose such different universities?
Perhaps for one it was the collegiate system and the historic city,
and for the other maybe the academic reputation and the West E n d .
No one w i l l ever know. One can only guess at the factors that influ-
enced their d e c i s i o n s ; friends, headmasters, the college prospectus
or the alternative prospectus. Yet ask either, and they'll happily
tell you w h i c h of the above brought them together. At Baker St.,
with red tulips under her ami, she disappeared.
To help with the information given to schools and prospective
Science and Technology students, the Union publishes an A l t e r -
native Prospectus each year. Written by student representatives,
this gives a consumers guide to higher education, and Imperial
C o l l e g e . Courses, facilities, accommodation, clubs and societies
and Post-Graduate opportunities are examined with a different
emphasis from that given in the official ' g l o s s y ' college prospectus.
It is mailed out by college, along with their own, to the schools
and colleges on the U C C A list as w e l l as to individuals who write
to the U n i o n . T h i s year's edition i s being completely rewritten to
bring it up to date. A l s o , for the first time, the prospectus w i l l be
or The West End?
made more attractive and appealing to read due to the new f a c i l i t i e s
available. One part is to be devoted to students' d a i l y routines as
we are sure that this would be useful information for prospective
students.
If you .would l i k e to write half a side of A 4 detailing things such
a s your accommodation and its condition, rent, travel arrangements,
fares, lectures, work load, eating and social life, we would be very
grateful. I do ask you to spend a little of your time i n the knowledge
that your contribution would be of great help to those of us who w i l l
be spending a lot of our time working on the publication, and to
those who can only imagine what life here is l i k e .
Send notes through the Internal M a i l to, The Academic Affairs
Officer, I C U Office or hand it in to your Departmental Representa-
tive.
Thanking you in advance,
