Kings Frozen Out
i s p ii 1 in ill 2
by IC Fourths
In wintry conditions and despite the
inclusion of several Fifth team players
I.C. Fourths put up a spirited performance
against Kings Thirds at Colliers Wood.
The game began with Kings on the attack
but the I.C. defence h e l d out w e l l with Al
Cable and P h i l L a k i n performing w e l l in the
centre and Barry Witts catching anything
that came through.
A s the first half progressed, midfield play-
ers B i l l Caffyn and Adam Esberger began to
get a grip on the game. A sustained period
of pressure culminated in Steve Marten wrong
footing the keeper and scoring I.C. Fourths
best away goal of the season.
Almost immediately from the centre I.C.
were on the attack again. James Rowley
headed to Patrick O ' K e l l y who beat the full
back and then crossed superbly for Steve
Sims to score an excellent goal.
After half time Keith Rake replaced Steve
Sims to add more weight to the midfield.
Shortly after this, B i l l Caffyn was injured
after making a brave challenge foiling an
almost certain goal.
With I.C. now down to ten men and facing
uphill, K i n g s applied further pressure forc-
ing Veteran Steve Veats and strong man Pete
Walker to make some brave tackles.
With fifteen minutes to go Kings scored
from a corner, but I.C. contained further
attacks and James Rowley nearly scored on
the break but his effort was cleared from
the line.
A s the sun faded in the west referee John
Healy blew the final whistle and I.C. Fourths
had two more valuable points.

LJS.E. II 1 IC III 5
I J C .3rds started the second half of the
season with an excellent win away to L . S . E . ,
under almost arctic conditions. The pitch
was extremely hard due to frost, and was
covered by an inch of snow. Despite having
several very big men in the team, I . C . kept
their footing much better than L . S . E . and,
although failing to score in the first half,
produced some excellent football which
their opponents failed to equal.
The non-appearance of Zambian star
O l l i e P i s enabled I . C . to c a l l upon the
services of first team player Brian Davies,
who responded with some excellent play in
mid-field along with Alan Donaldson, Adrian
Clarke and Ken M c P h a i l , I . C . came close to
scoring on several occasions in the first
half.nonecloser than when Peter Twigg was
brilliantly tackled by Dave M c P h a i l on the
edge of the L . S . E . penalty area when threa-
tening to score.
However it did not take long for I . C . to
score in the second half when, in the first
attack, the L . S . E . keeper could only parry
a shot from Dave M c P h a i l and Dave Hall hit
home the loose ball. T h i s goal only resulted
in some very lethargic play from I . c. , and
L . S . E . deservedly equalized after a moment
of slackness in the I . C . defence, following
a period of fierce pressure. I . C . continue d
to live dangerously for a while but when
A l a n Donaldson rose above the L . S . E .
defence to head home a corner, the home
side lost heart and I . C . went on to an excel-
lent w i n . The pleasing feature about the I . C
performance was the all-round teamwork,
with every player making a significant
contribution to the game, and on this form
I . C . have the beating of all the other teams
in the league.
After match conversation was based on
reassuring L . S . E . that this really was I . C .
3rds and, with one exception, not a mixture
of I . C . first and second teams. Perhaps we
should thank them for the 'compliment'.
Team: George Okuniewski, Cyril Knowles,
Giles Brereton, Peter Twigg, Dec McCruckin,
Brian Davies, Adrian Clarke, Ken McPhail,
Alan Donaldson, Dave Hall, Dave McPhail.
RUGBY- Firsts Slaughter R.A.F.
I.C. 1ST 62
R.A.F. UXBRIDGE 3
After the Christmas break everyone was
bound to be unfit - and with a couple of
exceptions this was the case. What was
needed was a good hard game to tone
everybody up - unfortunately we were
playing R.A.F. Uxbridge (say no more!).
After an uneventful coach journey we
arrived at the base to find what appeared
to be brand new changing rooms - many of
the team had never seen such luxury, es-
pecially Steve Ciunn who lives in a pig
stye so we understand.
Anyway we a l l changed, ran onto the
pitch, k i c k e d off, and the slaughter began.
Scoring was so easy that it was hard for
I.C. to maintain concentration. However,
tries came at regular intervals and the score
escalated to 32-3 at half-time. Yes, they
actually scored 3 points from a penalty
beneath our posts!
The second half continued as the first
half had finished off and by full time the
above total had been clocked u p . The only
events to break the boredom being a snow
shower and M. Cotter being warned by the
referee not to make the opposition look like
fools. A t one time B a s , our travelling l i n e s -
man, was slide tackled by one of their play-
ers and ended up on his back waving his
flag - not a pretty sight!
It must be said that had we played to our
full extent the score would have been over
100- and this was not achieved because too
many tries were missed due to dropping the
ball etc.
After the game we spent a long time in
their bar (25 p per pint, 18p per short)
thanks to a great coach driver - enough said!

Fifth's Half-
Time Summary
A s Christmas approached the F i f t h ' s
pulled off two fine 2-1 wins against very
strong opposition i n the form of R.S.M.II
and C h e l s e a 3rds. These results brought
the team's record for the term to P l a y e d 16
Won 13 Drawn 1 and L o s t 2; both defeats
were incurred when players had to be loaned
to higher teams to keep them going.
In the Cup the Fifths are through to the
quarter-finals to be played later this term.
Following tough encounters against both
Charing Cross 2nds and R.S.M. II. The
latter game was particularly notable for a
" J e k e l and H y d e " performance by Stu D i l -
lon, who was unable to do anything right in
the first-half, but after a few ' R e a c t i v a n '
tablets at half-time proceeded to bemuse
the opposition defence and score a b r i l l i -
ant hat-trick. Damion K e l l y also has reason
to remember this match as he scored proba-
bly one of the finest goals ever seen at Har-
lington. T h i s result probably, along with the
victory over I.C. 3rds (sorry C y r i l ) , were the
outstanding performances of the term.
A s for players, A l a n Cable (the captain)
is probably the most outstanding and could
e a s i l y be in the F i r s t ' s if he wanted to.
When playing alongside P h i l L a k i n the
central defence looks as solid as Fort Knox.
P h i l has done a brilliant job at centre-half
and has also been forced to help out an
over-worked fourth team defence. At full-
back Steve Kaye has come on in leaps and
bounds throughout the term, with Dennis
Cooke doing a brilliant job as the replace-
ment for P a u l Gohil who appears to have
disappeared after some excellent early
season performances. The only problem at
the moment in defence is the goalkeeper's
jersey, which has been filled by eight dif-
ferent people throughout the term. The mid-
field of Damion K e l l y , Adam Esberger, Mark
Clegg, and Graham Dewart has been one of
the strongest features of the Fifth s, with
the large amount of running and tackling it
does. Up front Mark F o l l i g u e t , A l e d P h i l l i p s ,
Stu D i l l o n , and his brother Bob D i l l o n have
proved an excellent strike force and if at
times they may have failed to score as many
goals as expected this has been made up for
for in a willingness to continuously cover
back and help the other members of the team,
Commiserations to Dennis Cooke on
failing to score in the 7-3 win against
London Hospital III. He sent an accurate
shot towards the top corner, only to see it
brilliantly saved by a keeper who had moved
out of the way of far easier efforts. B y the
way, if you get injured keep clear of London
Hospital one of their players went down
injured clutching his ankle only to be infor
informed by a team-mate that it was carti-
lage trouble.
It is interesting to note that the seconds
best win last term of 8-0 was achieved
when half their team was made up of F i f t h
team players.
