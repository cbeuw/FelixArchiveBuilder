Carl Seaford Dies
It was with regret that I learned of the death of Carl Sea-
ford. Carl had been Domestic Bursar at I C from 1958 to 1975
and from then until his retirement on 30th April 1978, Domes-
tic Manager. He was probably best known by the students for
his " 3 Carl T r i c k " at the Summer F e t e . He died peacefully i n
his sleep during Wednesday night.
ICWA Ball
So just when I thought there was only one mistake on the
calendar i t turns out that the ICWA B a l l i s on Friday 2nd
March, not as advertised. I think that i t ' s still being held i n
the J C R , although the price has not yet been finalised.
Getting Wet
It i s usual to hold the ICWA V . Executive pancake race on
Shrove Tuesday February 27th this year to coincide with the
annual testing of the fire hoses i n Beit Quad. A s yours truly
referees the event, and therefore stands still the longest, I
can forsee getting very wet and cold.
News Page
Students are often accused of being very inward - looking
and cut off from the outside world. In an attempt to remedy
ithis situation, at IC, F E L I X w i l l be carrying a brief summary
jof the past week's important news items. I would like some
; response to this idea. Is i t worthwhile or do students read
newspapers anyway? Letters to F E L I X Office, please.
Election Publicity
Manifestos for the forthcoming elections w i l l be printed i n
F E L I X on the 2nd and 9th of March O N L Y . Entries should be
neatly written, preferably typed, and not exceeding 300 words
(they w i l l be cut at the 300th word). Accompanying photos
should be black and white with good contrast. I w i l l print a
reminder later on for candidates who forget/change their minds.
Credits
Everything was going according to plan until I remember the
awkward space at the bottom of page 3. Many thanks to Sheyne
for writing the article that appears below .He did so at very
short notice. Thanks also to C o l i n , E r i c , J i l l and John for
I contribution and paste-up and also to Anita for typing and
pasting-up correction and Ian for printing. Cheers,
John

A Plotting Union!
Shirley Williams, Secretary of State for Education and Science,
has announced that tuition fee levels will be increased again for
next session, but supposedly only to keep pace with inflation/Even
so, this could probably mean a 10% increase.
Our union policy i s to oppose increases in tuition fees, oppose
the fact that overseas students are charged more than home students,
(discriminatory levels are in operation), and e s p e c i a l l y to oppose
any increases for self-supporting students - such increases not
necessarily reflected by an increase in income.
For many of us who are supported financially in some way and
don't have to pay our own fees it i s very easy not to be all that
bothered about whether tuition fees go up or not. We must remember,
though, that a sizeable number of our colleagues do have to pay
their own fees - and this includes home students a s well a s oversea?
students - and a s such we should a l l a c t together a s a Union to help
them with this problem.
The most sensible manoeuvre is to try to persuade the College
not to increase fee levels for next year for self-supporting students
but only for supported students. Retaining discriminatory levels,
this would only cost the C o l l e g e about £56,000 which is a very
small sum when compared with the several m i l l i o n collected v i a tui-
tion fees. Ideally, of course, we could a s k that there be no increases
at a l l , and that overseas students be charged at the home rate, but
this would cost over £400,000 and i s perhaps a little over-optimistic.
There are several concessions which the C o l l e g e could make, how-
ever, between these two extremes.
At the Open Meeting of the External Affairs and Overseas S t u d -
ents Committees on Tuesday (6.30 p m , Union Lower Refectory) we
can a l l d i s c u s s how the campaign should be run, and what form it
c a n take, s o please come along if you have any ideas, or if you're
just interested.
A far wider question i s the Government's attitude towards overseas
students in general, and I'm at the moment preparing a paper on the
subject for U L U S R C so if anyone has any constructive comments
on the subject, I'd be pleased to hear them.
Competition
One unfortunate aspect of being a card-carrying member of the
Liberal Party (shock, horrors, gasp!) i s that I get to hear all the
Jeremy Thorpe/Norman Scott J o k e s . But, if you think you have one
.which i s really original (and most probably s i c k ) then I'd be plea-
sed if you didn't send it to me, and then I won't have to give you a
prize of a towel and a tube of stuff, (toothpaste?). If you did send it
in, however, and you did w i n , then you w i l l get.the prize. E n t r i e s
should be sent to the F E L I X office not later than Monday 22nd
!5.30 pm.
