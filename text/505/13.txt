Mary Barnes at the Royal Court
David Edgar's play "Mary Barnes"
opened at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane
Square On Wednesday 10th January
Never before having heard the name I had
no idea what sort of show I'd let John Harris
talk me into reviewing. I must confess, how-
ever, to have enjoyed an unusal, provoca-
tive and sometimes amusing drama-cum-
documentary.
The p l a y is about a " H a l f - w a y H o u s e " in
1965; then an unorthodox and unproven treat-
ment of schizophrenics based on coexistanie
and " F a m i l y " therapy, " C u r i n g i s some-
thing you do to b a c o n i " .
It was there, following a mental break-
down that Mary Barnes spent five years of
her life.
Today, the real Mary Barnes i s l i v i n g i n
Devon, where she paints and a l s o awaits
the publication of her second b o o k L , (
The calm and humdrum beginning of the
play i s exploded by the shock waves of
P a t t i L o v e ' s highly convincing performance
as the hystericall Mary.
A l s o notable i s Simon C a l l o w as the Ame-
rican psychotherapist! E d d i e . H e nurses
Mary as she crazes for rebirth and develop-
es an obsession for painting.
I got the impression that the therapists
are indeed as deranged as the patients. A s
the play progresses one loses track of the
threshold'of sanity, so much so that when
at last two " n o r m a l " characters appear 'i
they not only seem out of place, but they I
are the ones who look mad.
The absence of a proscenium curtain
brings the audience closer to the production.
I felt almost as a c h i l d playing with a toy
theatre.

The play i s punctuated by total darkness,
four lettered words and B e a t l e s ' m u s i c . The
paintings used are true originals. Farago's
direction was detailed and realistically
superb.
Don't stay away from this moving pro-
duction !

Six matches this week, not seven as I
said l a s t i s h , (four league and two cup).

Would, Kumar (if he played) or anyone,
please tell me about this match sometime,
please ??
I.C. II V . F U L H A M IV (H) 6 -3
T h i s was a good victory over a team
level on pts with the seconds, and main -
tains I.C*'s challenge in div 5. A young lad
for Fulham must be mentioned -he looked
like Desmond Douglas and was twice as
good - (he won h i s three matches and spent
the time between winning, in giving advice
to our team!).

The match of the week -1 don't t h i n k !
(no comments about that last phrase G a l -
ium!). We scraped a win - no thanks to a
dismal performance by me - but Stean and
Reed pulled us through.
I.C. Ill V. M A R K S A N D S P E N C E R (H) 4-5
T h i s cup match was given away, (as we
had only two players, and the pressure to
w i n 5 games out of 6 was too much), which
was i n complete contrast to the jammy luck
of the fourths who played the same team,
two days later, only to find that M & S were
this time a player short; (they scraped a 6-3
win somehow). I think Lambert was d i s -
tracted by his bread roll firing photon torpe-
does (chips) at him during his tea (sorry,
Mark 0Â« T h e fourths also played a home cup
tie against a team one division higher
Dept. of E M P III, the amazing Pete Ruther-
ford again won a l l his 3 sets, including one
against an opponent with an 88% average i n
div 5, and with Lambert's 2 w i n s , they
triumphed 5-4!!

Orienteering
Club
The clubs first event of 1979 was held
last Sunday over Crooksbury and Ruttenham
Commons. The combination of open heath -
land in the E a s t and forrest plantation to the
West proved very fast terrain for those who
were fit enough to stand the pace.
With the advent of a new year many club
members have moved up to longer and more
difficult courses. Despite this, performances
were above average, indicating that it could
prove a successful year for the club.
Perhaps the best run of the day was Steve
K i r k ' s 4th in M 2 1 A , less than 3 mins. behind
the current ranked British No. 1. In M19
Ken Warren was equal 4th with Gary Long-
hurst close behind, and Andy Q u i c k f a l l , K.
Pratt and M. Boyes also did well on their
courses.
The results of the S . E . Galloppen (a type
of league) were also announced on Sunday,
and congratulations are due to David Rosen
for winning M21A by a clear 21 points.
Club meetings are held every Friday at
12.40 in the Senior Common Room. A l l inter-
ested in Orienteering are most welcome to
attend. Some details are a l s o available on
the c l u b notice board situated in the Union
main entrance h a l l .
Ken Warren
Gross Country Club
The end of last term saw history in the l
making as the cross country club staged
their annual handicap in Richmond Park.
Having helped his team win two trophies in
the previous week, Maurice Wilson then
achieved the remarkable feat of winning the
handicap for the third successive year, so j
crowning what must be the greatest eight
days in his short, yet brilliant career.
Setting off over two minutes behind the
slowest runners and only just over a minute
ahead of the fastest, he s t i l l managed what
everyone had imagined to be i m p o s s i b l e .
Disregarding the threat from Acford that he
would be passed w i t h i n the first two miles,
Maurice went scorching off at the start and
soon had the slower runners i n his s i g h t s .
P a u s i n g only for a troublesome dog, and
to direct those ahead of him onto the right
path, he surged into the lead up the final
h i l l and sprinted away at the f i n i s h to w i n
by a clear 20 seconds, in a new personal
best time of 30.21. Gary Longhurst rani on
w e l l to f i n i s h second, and R i c h (ireen, runn-
ing from the back, recorded the fastest time
to f i n i s h third. Ian Morton was fourth, Geoff
Sherwood, fading badly at the end, was
fifth, and B r y a n Acford was a disappointing
sixth and l a s t for the second s u c c e s s i v e
year. Credit to Ian A l v e y for producing a
close race, but the day must belong to Mau-
rice Wilson, a truely magnificent athlete,
surely destined for greater things.
A number of hardy souls ventured to Guild-
ford on December 16th to compete in the
annual 10 mile road race along the Hogsback.
Generally treated as the start of the Xmas
f e s t i v i t i e s , the I . C team were astounded,
to say the least, by their s u c c e s s this year
in finishing I7th behind many more exper-
ienced c l u b teams.
F i r s t for I.C. was Steve K i r k , who, des-
pite having a bad race, completed the
h i l l y ten miles i n about 56 minutes to f i n -
ish 55th, beating the first woman home in so
doing. Not so lucky were R i c h Green and
P a u l C l a r k e . After being beckoned out of
the bushes by P a u l with less than a mile
to go, R i c h outsprinted him on the downhill
f i n i s h . They were closely followed by Bryan
Acford, who just failed to finish in the first
100, but neverthelsss recorded a creditable
time, w e l l under an hour.
There were a number of other s u c c e s s e s
by I.C. athletes during the vacation. Several
had very good runs i n their county cham-
pionships, and Ian Morton won his c l u b ' s
Xmas handicap and drinking competition.
The first fixture of this term was last
Saturday at the Royal Military Acadamy,
Sandhurst. Traditionally an I.C. fixture, the
invitation was this year extended to U . L . ,
who, i n their usual tradition, supplied two
runners to complement our team. Despite
Bryan's attempts to dissuade even these from
trayelling with us again, we arrived in one
piece. '
Having time to spare we explored some
of the acreage and tried our hand at part of
the assualt course, not anticipating that
worse was to come in the race. A good qua-
lity field assembled at the start for a brief-
ing of the course, by the Seargent Major, who
pointed out some of the obstacles on the
course which had to be s c a l e d . Unfortunate-
ly, he made no mention of the state of the
course, which was more suitable to ice
skates than running shoes.
Despite falling through thin ice and
other hazards everyone returned without any
broken bones. The first Imperial man back
was Steve K i r k in 11th p l a c e . Not far be-
hind was a c l o s e bunch in 18th to 20th
places consisting of Ian Morton, R i c h Green,
and Mike K e l l y . A n d these, together with the
U . L . runners, completed the team which fin-
ished a c l o s e third behind Thames Hare &
Hounds and Milocarnians, beating several
others. The other I.C. runners were Bryan
Acford (29), P a u l Clarke (33), R i c h Harring-
ton (38) and Ian Alvey (47) running his
usual captain's race, out of 74 finishers.
After the debriefing in the tearoom, R i c h
drove home to save the train fares. B u i rem-
ember, Back Straight, Head U p , and Bowels
Free Are Very Good Soldierly H a b i t s ! ! !
