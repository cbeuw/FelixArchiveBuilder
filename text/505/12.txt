TM
AM
PM
is Transcendental Meditation, a
simple, natural, effortless
technique practised:
once in the morning
and once again in the evening.
.Page 13
TM is something very ^practical and is backed up by over 600
scientific research* studies on the psychological, physiological and
sociological changes taking place as a result of regular practice.
F i n a l l y it should be recalled that the technique is extremely easy
and effortless. It is NOT a form of concentration or contemplation,
nor does it require a change in diet or life s t y l e . It is not a religion
and doesn't require faith or belief.
If you are interested and would like to hear more about TM then
please come to our talk on Tuesday 23January inl M e c h . E n g . Room
664. The talk w i l l last about 40 - 50 minutes. P l e a s e bring any
questions you have.

Both times one meditates for 1 5 - 2 0 minutes sitting in a
comfortable chair with the eyes c l o s e d .
TM produces a deep level of mental relaxation and physical
rest. A s a result of this deep rest, the mind becomes clearer,
more alert; its ability to solve problems, remember information,
and make intelligent decisions improves. A l s o the body gets rid of
deep stresses and fatigue and gains greater energy and efficiency,
mind-body co-ordination improves and we enjoy better health.
Is it worth sacrificing 40 minutes a day to relax? Isn't life hectic
enough without having to make up those 40 minutes by being busier
than ever? The point is that though meditations are pleasant periods
of profound relaxation, it is for the benefits of TM that people medi-
tate. After meditating one feels refreshed - e s p e c i a l l y noticeable
after a tough day. For example: one may get home after a busy day
(perhaps feeling a little tired), invest 20 minutes in meditating then
reap the benefits by being able to spend the rest of the evening to
the maximum advantage and enjoyment; whether it be a trip to the
cinema, an evening out with friends, this weeks problem sheet/lab
report, or whatever. So, far from losing out on 40 minutes a day, one
is able to accomplish more, more efficiently, during our a c t i v i t i e s .
Thus it is that TM is exceptionally useful to the busy life at I.C.
and the practice of it in no way involves wasting time, time which
we cannot afford to i l l - s p e n d .
£10 COMPETITION
F o l l o w i n g l a s t weeks article, there has been a change to the
conditions of the slide competition being organized by I.C. P h o t o -
graphic Society. A s college w i l l want to keep selected s l i d e s for.
their permanent' show', they w i l l take copies of these s l i d e s , and
the o r i g i n a l * w i l l be returned to their owners - i.e. everyone w i l l
get their original slides back.
A s before, we are looking for any s l i d e s (in a : 2 " x 2"mount),
related to Imperial College. There i s a £10 prize for the best s l i d e

February. I hope that two members of the Committee, who s h a l l
be nameless , are now happy and w i l l accept your entries at the
Photosoc shop (see What's On). They can also be handed in at
any Meeting, or to me, if you can find me.
Selected slides are to be used in a s l i d e show by the Rector

members of staff to take to schools etc.

Carniel Budiardjo was born and raised in
Britain, met and married her Indonesian hus-
band in Europe and in 1952 settled with him
in Indonesia. Mr. Budiardjo had a government
job and she joined the Foreign Ministry.
In 1965 there was an anti-communist
counter-coup in w h i c h , it has been estimat-
ed, about one million people were killed
and half-fi-million imprisoned. Since then
many thousands have been imprisoned
without trial or charge, many of them not
even directly connected with the communist
attempted coup or the communist party.
In the purges that followed the Budiardjos
were dismissed and Mr. Budiardjo was impri-
v soned. He was freed in late 1967 but in Sept-
ember 1968, the army arrived to arrest Mrs.
Budiardjo herself. Her husband happened to
be in the house at the time and so, despite
his carrying a document declaring h i s un-
conditional release, he was arrested a l s o .
Eventually, due entirely to efforts by
Amnesty, Mrs. Bjdiardjo was released in
November 1971 and allowed to return to
Britain, where she has been campaigning
for the release of other Indonesian political
prisoners ever s i n c e .
She is giving an A s s o c i a t e d Studies L e c -
ture at 1.30pm on Thursday 25 January,
talking about Indonesia and her experiences
- an excellent opportunity to hear a first
hand account of political oppression.

Summer Stateside

Wouldn't you l i k e to work in America this
summer and earn enough to tour around the
States? Of course you would, so why not do
it this year with the B r i t i s h U n i v e r s i t i e s
North America C l u b ?
B U N A C is a non-profit making body which
organises an exchange programme enabling
B r i t i s h university students to work in the
S t a t e s - foreign students are also welcome.
B U N A C arranges students' work permits,
flights, insurance and the first night's board
in America.They also keep a representative
in New York throughout the summer to give
help to the students when, or if, they need
it.
Students have the choice of finding their
own job or of working in a summer camp.
Those who choose to work on a camp have
the further choice of whether to work with 1
the children (it helps if you are the 'sporty*
type) or (for more pay) working on the k i t -
chen or maintenance side of the camp.
Those students who choose to work on a
camp have everything arranged for them. How-
ever, those choosing to find their own job
have to arrange everything for themselves
although B U N A C does publish a job direc-
tory later in the term.
We are the I.C. Committee for B U N A C .
Come and find out more about the B U N A C
schemes from u s . We meet every F r i d a y at
