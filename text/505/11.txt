While most I.C. students were Christmas shopping, recovering
from hangovers, or even revising (?) for Christmas tests, an intre-
pid party of four and two members of the academic staff made their
ways to Goldsmith's College in Lewisham for the Annual Conferen-
ce of the World University Service (UK). ICU is an affiliate of WUS
(UK), an organisation which actively helps the needs of students,
in particular worldwide.
WUS is an international organization which traces its roots to the
1920s to a group called European Student Relief. T h i s was mainly
concerned with the situation of war-affected academics and tried to
alleviate their problems. The group adopted its present name in the
1950s and now concentrates on projects which w i l l benefit commun-
ities as a whole. WUS is dedicated to the freedom of thought and
action in education (a term taken in its widest possible sense by
WUS) and pursues this aim by encouraging educational bodies, such
as universities, to act responsibly s o c i a l l y . Hence WUS opposes all
discrimination, exploitation and injustice in education and, where
it can, takes action.
The U K branch of WUS concentrates on the needs of overseas
students, particularly refugees in this country, and to a smaller
extent in providing information to the public, the Government and
its members. Help is given, when requested, in setting up projects
whereby say a university WUS group a s s i s t s a village in the Third ,
World independently of WUS, though with its support.
A s the 1978 Treasurer, M r . B i l l Robertson of I.e., reported WUS
(UK) is an educational charity. Approaching £3 million was spent
in 1977/8, but the importance of this money lies in the use to which
it'has been put. The Government, through the Overseas Development
Ministry and WUS, supports C h i l e a n , Ugandan, Ethiopian and Indo-
Chinese refugee students in the U K and African students at the
University of Rhodesia. Through charitable trusts and individual
donations, aid is given to Kurdish students in the U K and P a l e s -
tinian and Nepalese students overseas. I.C. collected £500 for WUS
during registration last term; simi lar col lections were held around
the country. Some university and college WUS groups even finance
scholarships themselves. College authorities a s s i s t by waiving fees
for needy students. However, Bill Robertson warned against over-
dependence on finance from Government sources, which might not
always be forthcoming.
Nebulous
Richard L u c e , M P , Shadow Minister for Overseas Development
spoke about "Human Rights and Educational A i d " . He began by
emphasising that human rights' problems are basic but " n e b u l o u s " .
Having laid down certain conditions for considering human rights,
in particular that condemnation of inhumane regimes must be irres-
pective of the political complexion of the particular regime (e.g.
Soviet Union and Iran), Mr. L u c e went on to say that human rights'
problems have to be dealt with country by country with due regard to
historical, strategic and economic factors. T h i s contradictory stand-
point was typical of a speech that asked many questions, but a n s -
wered very few; it seems strange for a Shadow Minister not to be
full of possible solutions to such basic (but " n e b u l o u s " ) problems.
However, M r . Luce made several points that are worth repeating.
In principle he expressed support for voluntary organizations, such
as WUS.Oxfam and Amnesty International, who can gain credibility
abroad by being politcally neutral. Such charities are vital since
they have the organization to bypass regimes and distribute aid and
education where needed, i.e. the people, efficiently and at short
notice. In most cases it would be difficult for the Government to do
this while working with the regime in question. At the moment,
refugee students are officially c l a s s e d as overseas students and
there is no Governmental strategy for refugees, particularly in regaid
to education.Mr. Luce suggested that human rights policy should be
institutionalised in Britain and that in the long-term refugees should
be helped so that they could return home.
Tuition Fees
The Rt. Hon. Shirley Williams, M P , gave a speech on " E d u c a t i o n
for Overseas S t u d e n t s " . After reaffirming her strong belief that theie
should be a " s u b s t a n t i a l proportion of overseas s t u d e n t s " in B r i -
tish further education, she outlined the Government's strategy in
this area. This includes, as described in F E L I X last week, that
the " h i d d e n s u b s i d y " of £100 m towards overseas student fees from
the Government should be used " p o s i t i v e l y " to help " s e l e c t e d
groups" particularly from developing countries. This would mean
the others would have to pay more, and the Minister suggested
means-testing and academic scholarships to help those less w e l l -
off. ( N B ICU is opposed to both of these).
Mrs. Williams echoed Mr. L u c e ' s point that a systematic approach
for overseas students and refugees is needed and emphasised that
admissions are the responsibility of the academic world and not of
immigration officers.
Workshops
Between speeches and conference business, three workshops took
place. Unfortunately, very little was achieved in terms of new policy
or new ideas, since most of the time was spent in defining the pro-
blem to be d i s c u s s e d . T h i s was due to the wide range of experience
(or lack of it) between the delegates. Hence the WUS workers lead-
ing the workshops tended to dominate; a position shown in the
resolutions prepared by each workshop, which on the whole,support-
ed the present work of WUS and its workers. .
This year ICU has collected about £500 for WUS and organised
an A n t i - R a c i a l i s t Week. However, there is no WUS group in ICU and
consequently External Affairs Committee are responsible for WUS
affairs in I C U . So anyone interested in WUS, and its affairs, is w e l -
come to contact Sheyne Lucock for more information.
