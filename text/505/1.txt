RCS PLAN TO KIDNAP DUKE
Is Nobody Safe from Imperial Rag Stunts?
A Royal College of Science Union meet -
ing on Tuesday voted to kidnap H R H The
Duke of Edinburgh in order to raise money
for R C S R a g .
Martin Watson, proposing the motion, told
the meeting that P r i n c e P h i l i p would be
attending the annual dinner of the A r c t i c
C l u b at Imperial C o l l e g e on Monday 22nd
January. The meeting voted almost unani-
mously that R C S U should kidnap him for a
ransom of half the Queen's annual income.
It was pointed out that the Duke might be
accompanied by armed bodyguards, but
this objection was brushed a s i d e .
R C S Union members had earlier heard
that the Duke of Edinburgh had d e c l i n e d an
invitation to attend the R C S A n n u a l Dinner
later in the year. Revenge at this refusal
was also a motive of the kidnap p l a n .

post of R C S Honorary Junior Treasurer f o l -
lowing the resignation of John Mottishead.
The candidates are Cathy Hyde proposed

meeting.

Mottishead's accident and subsequent r e s i g -
nation and would l i k e to carry on this j o b .

best man (sic) for the job if Cathy were not
standing.
V o t i n g takes p l a c e next Tuesday, 23rd
January, in a l l R C S departments.
Collection
A brief meeting of the R C S C a r n i v a l C o m -
mittee was h e l d as part of the Union meet-
ing, at w h i c h R C S V i c e President R a c h e l
Snee proposed that Â£800 be collected to buy
a phonic hearing a i d for Jerome C a n d i n , the
11 year-old deaf brother of a student i n L i f e
Sciences 1. T h i s hearing a i d enables a c h i l d
to hear h i s teacher at a distance of up to
half a mile and therefore a l l o w s the c h i l d a
much more normal life than is p o s s i b l e with
an ordinary hearing a i d .
T h e c o l l e c t i o n , which h a s to be organised
through a registered charity, was agreed by
the meeting.

S T O I C Returns
The A S T M S technicians dispute is now
over and this means that S T O I C can use the
college T V Studio equipment again . T h i s
should result in programmes of a much h i g h -
er technical standard than recent ones.
S T O I C is hoping to begin making special
programmes to be shown on Tuesday lunch-
times this term and any c l u b or society
interested in featuring in its own programme
should contact Bryan Steele or Dave Ghani
via the c o l l e g e T V Studios, as soon as
p o s s i b l e .
A t present S T O I C is investigating the
p o s s i b i l i t y of extending its network to
include L i n s t e a d and Tizard H a l l s . S T O I C
also hopes to further extend its system to
the Northside H a l l s at a later date.
A P Conference
The U n i v e r s i t y of L o n d o n U n i o n Students'
Representative C o u n c i l , meeting l a s t Thurs-
day, decided to recommend to the next full
meeting of the S R C that a L o n d o n A l t e r n a -
tive P r o s p e c t u s Conference be held under
the a u s p i c e s of U L U .
The decision was made in response to a
paper prepared by Roger Stotesbury, I C U
A c a d e m i c Affairs Officer, who thought that
other London c o l l e g e s could benefit from
I C ' s experience in producing an Alternative
P r o s p e c t u s .
It w a s agreed that Roger Stotesbury and
Sheyne L u c o c k , the U L U E x e c u t i v e member
responsible, should organize the conference
