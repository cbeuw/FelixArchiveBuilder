ASTMS- The Settlement
The dispute between the Association of
Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staff
at IC and the College, which ended last
week, is estimated to have cost the College
a quarter of a million pounds.
F o r ten weeks technicians refused to
work on almost a l l e l e c t r i c a l equipment as
it had not been inspected i n accordance
with C o l l e g e Safety P o l i c y . Because their
a c t i o n d i d not amount to a strike, C o l l e g e
was s t i l l paying up to £25,000 per week in
wages to idle staff.
T h e settlement gives A S T M S members the
extra five d a y s ' annual leave which they
were demanding, giving them parity with
academic related staff. It was the granting
of extra leave to academic related staff
last year which l e d to the similar demand
by A S T M S members. The agreement w i l l be
reviewed in the case of any future r e v i s i o n
of leave entitlement for academic related
staff.
C o l l e g e has a l s o agreed to a phased pro-
gramme of implementation of the Safety P o -
l i c y and a d e t a i l e d examination of the safe-
ty p o s i t i o n i n each department. A S T M S i s to
cooperate i n this and has assured the College
that it cannot see any future circumstances
arising in w h i c h action on safety matters
w i l l be combined with industrial action on
non-safety matters.
I C A S T M S Secretary Arthur Sier told a
meeting of the union l a s t week that the
agreement was " a considerable v i c t o r y "
for A S T M S . H e said that members must keep
up the momentum on safety and look out for
any unsafe equipment.
A s a result of the agreement normal work-
ing has been resumed.
One matter which held up the resolution
of the dispute for two days was the question
of P a m Martins, a Metallurgy Department
photography technician, whom A S T M S
claimed was being v i c t i m i s e d for her part i n
the d i s p u t e . A statement was finally signed
by L l o y d Thomas on behalf of the Depart-
ment giving an assurance that " i t w i l l
return to the status quo that existed before
the d i s p u t e . " .
The dispute over holidays started i n June
last year and is therefore probably the l o n g -
est dispute involving a whole section of
staff in B r i t i s h university history. I C
A S T M S stepped up the dispute in November
by taking action over College Safety P o l i c y .
A t an 8 hour meeting between College and
A S T M S on Friday 5th January under the
chairmanship of a C o n c i l i a t i o n Officer of the
A d v i s o r y , C o n c i l i a t i o n and Arbitration Ser-
v i c e ( A C A S ) agreement was reached in prin-
ciple on leave entitlement parity for the
technical staff. Further d i s c u s s i o n s extend-
ed the agreement to other A S T M S members
in college.
Similar disputes i n other London C o l l e g e s
have not been settled. A S T M S accepted that
the agreement would not set a precedent for
staff i n other c o l l e g e s or u n i v e r s i t i e s .

College Fires
Two small fires broke out in college l a s t
week but both were extinguished before the
arrival of the fire brigade.
The first occurred on Wednesday in the
C h e m i c a l Engineering Department. A post-
graduate in a level 5 laboratory was work-
ing with the chemical tetrahydrofuran which
overheated and caught fire causing a small
amount of damage to the fume cupboard. Two
postgraduates using hand-held fire e x t i n -
guishers managed to put out the flames be-
fore the fire brigade arrived on the s c e n e .
The fire on Friday lunchtime was slightly
more serious. Contractors carrying out re-
pairs to the lightning conductor on the roof
of Mines were using a propane gas cylinder
and torch. Gas escaping from the cylinder
caught fire setting light to a tarpaulin and
damaging a fume cupboard extractor hood.
College staff ran out a fire hose from
level 4 of the b u i l d i n g and extinguished the
flames. The fire brigade .arrived in time to
finish the job. Damage is estimated at £100.
