Apology
It has been brought to our attention that Pauline
Clerk, who was referred to as 'Conference
Organiser' in the News Review of Issue 844,
is in fact Accommodation Lettings Organiser.
FELIX would like to apologise for this hideous
slur on the Conference Centre, which is, after
all, a good upstanding organisation within
College, intent only on ripping student
residences off rather than flooding them. It has
also come to our attention that they are kind
to animals.
