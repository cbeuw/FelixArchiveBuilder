Harlington horror L e
^ b i a n
&
and
Many freshers who attended trials at Harlington last
week will have been shocked at what they saw there.
Many 'experienced' students at IC will also have been
shocked and saddened. The reason-what appears to
be the terminal destruction of our playing fields. The
explanation-money.
Harlington playing fields were built on a thick base
of gravel. That gravel is worth many millions of
pounds. Streeters, experts in the field of gravel
extraction, have been contracted to remove the
gravel. For this, someone in College will receive up
to £3 million. After much argument and debate in
Sydney Harbour-Bridge's (name changed to draw
attention to himself) year as Union President, we have
now been assured that these monies will be spent to
benefit student sport and athletic clubs at Imperial
College. Fine?
No. Streeters ARE experts in their field. But to my
knowledge, and I have inquired, they have never had
to work under sports playing fields before. Their
experience is working agricultural land. They have
won awards for the land that they have relaid after
their work. And after being given a personal tour by
our dedicated groundsmen at Harlington, of the area
that has been completed and relaid, Streeters should
certainly win an award for that too. Because we have
the flattest cabbage field I've even seen, and I've seen
a few of them. It's probably great for corn too.
However, it is rubbish for hockey and cricket, the two
sports for which that section of ground was to be
used.
The pitches already relaid were intended for use this
year. They are clearly not ready. Many student
representatives had warned Imperial College that this
would be the case for several years now. Their
comments have been ignored by those handling the
contract from the IC end. The result is the loss of all
but one hockey pitch, one rugby pitch and two spare
soccer pitches.
Streeters are clearly not meeting their obligations
with regard to the Harlington contract, and the
reinstatement of pitches has been mismanaged.
College must be made to realise that their students
are suffering as a result of the delays. I anticipate that
much of my time this year will be spent dealing with
this matter.
More fun next week.

Big Mac calls E G M
The issue of loans has reared its ugly head again after
a long time of being out of the public eye.
On Friday 20th October, the White Paper on student
loans will be coming up for discussion in the House
of Commons. There has been little change in the paper
since its introduction in November 1988, though there
have been several feasibility reports on how to run the
loans scheme.
An Emergency General Meeting (EGM) has been
called to publicise the continuing action of Imperial
College Union and to explain to those students who
don't already know the consequences of the
introduction of the present proposed loan scheme.
This will take place in the JCR on Tuesday 17th
October at 1pm.
The introduction of loans has serious consequences
for all students. Whether you're for or against the
White Paper in its present form, it will financially
cripple students in London and should not be accepted
therefore. Come along and find out.
Having had six years of the 'ins and outs' of being gay
at IC, I thought I would write a few words for all of
you arriving here unsure of how to tackle your
sexuality. Life at IC for, unfortunately, the majority
centres around the various College bars. With this
tends to go the associated sexism and bigotry of a
virtually all-male bar environment.
Such attitudes are driven by the participants own
sexual frustrations and insecurities, and should
therefore should be ignored when making decisions
about your own life.
There are many people at IC who genuinely believe
that homosexuality is unnatural. It is through contact
with lesbians and gay men who are positive about
their own sexuality that the attitudes of these people
can be changed.
In the long run it will be much better for you to come
to terms with your sexuality; accept it and 'come out'.
The feelings of inner strength, self-respect and
security that come from this seemingly impossible act
are very real indeed. Most of the excuses voiced,
internally or otherwise, tend to be of the form "What
would X do/think/say" (for X read mother, father,
friends, etc). Although it is very easy to pose and
answer these questions (usually negatively) most
friends and relatives when presented with the facts
change their long unquestioned attitudes. In some
cases there are real difficulties involved in coming out,
but whatever the case either the Union's or ULU's
Lesbian and Gay Welfare Officer should be able to
offer support and advice. At present the Union post
is vacant but will soon be filled. Until then the ULU
Lesbian and Gay Group meets on Thursdays in ULU
and is a very easy group to attend. It is also far enough
away from College for the less secure amongst you
to stand virtually no chance of meeting
acquaintances!
