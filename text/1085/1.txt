Showpiece shop goes to the wall

A B A Holdings, who recently opened
a shop offering photocopying ser-
vices on the main walkway, went
into receivership on Wednesday after
their major shareholders made a
decision to withdraw capital.
A B A moved from their old
premises on Gloucester Road after
being invited by College to take up
retail space on the walkway. The
College had hoped to provide a cen-
tral photocopying outlet on campus
which could handle the volume of
photocopying needed by College.
Mike Hansen, Director of Finance
at Imperial, commented: "We specif-
ically chose a small company that
was not Kodak, thinking that they
would be more attuned to work with
us." A B A opened in January and
aimed to take much of the photo-
copying business that had previously
been catered for by individual
departments.
Warning signs of the company's
problems were noticed by several
students, one said: "I often wondered
when A B A hoped to do any photo-
copying, I tried many times through-
out last term and always found it
closed." Mr Hansen, however,
denied any prior knowledge of the
A B A ' s financial difficulties,
expressing his disappointment that
the arrangement had not worked out,
"We find ourselves back in the posi-
tion we were in three months ago and
we are having to examine the choic-
es that College has."
A B A Holdings has been taken
over by Callprint, another printing
and photocopying company. A
spokesperson for Callprint assured
Felix that they were hoping to reopen
the campus shop as soon as possible.
Mr Hansen could not confirm this
statement, "ABA's contract is now
null and void and if the new owners

wish to have a branch on the South
Kensington campus they will have to
renegotiate with us."
Andy Thompson, ICU's Print Unit
Manager, who had initially feared
that A B A would significantly effect
his business, commented: "They had
no real effect on our business, which
is mostly from the Union Clubs and

Tea on the lawn
N E W S T E A M
The first examinations to be held in
the rigid-structured-temporary-mar-
quee took place on Monday, amidst
confusion, anger and despair. One
candidate described the affair as "an
exam tea-party," and "a complete
joke."
Since the change of venue for the
examinations was announced, a
number of students have expressed
dismay at the decision, (Felix 1084).
Although the location of examina-
tions cannot be influenced by the
University of London, Sarah White,
President of U L U , emphasised that
Imperial College had been pressured
by Senate House to provide a reason-
able examination environment. This
would include keeping Southside
bar closed in the daytime, ensuring
there were no deliveries made during
exams and the hiring of extra securi-
ty to 'keep the peace'. College have
also been pressed to provide closer
toilet facilities - at the moment, stu-
dents have to go to Southside bar. Ms
