F E L I X FRIDAY 2 N D M A Y COLUMNS 21
lan Caldwell is to be congratulated.
• His swift action in erecting a mar-
;quee in Princes Gardens has prevent-
Sed much distress and inconvenience
'befalling a large group of people. I'm
not referring to the poor sods that are
i having to sit their exams in a tent, but
the directors of the water companies,
because there has been a bountiful
^ supply of much-needed rain since its
I construction.
In all my time at Imperial, I am
i pushed to think of a bigger cockup
than this. At this rate, IC will be ele-
ivated to such a pinnacle of ridicule
: within the university sector that we
shall not be able to raise our heads.
Would any other institute treat its
students in such a disgraceful way?
They say this move will minimise
noise, though even a very senior
member of the Suite Five brigade
was heard to say that yes it will be
noisy, but it will be cheaper. But
would any other body of students
allow itself to be messed about to this
extent. Unfortunately there are too
many students here who, if told that
their exams were to be held in
Piccadilly Circus during rush hour,
would dutifully assemble by the Eros
statue, and that's the clincher. We let
them get away with murder.
Simon B a k e r
It does not take a genius to realise
that if a building project lasting more
than 12 months
is situated next
to the Great
Hall it stands a
pretty good
chance of dis-
rupting exams.
Schal realised
this. They
asked College
repeatedly for
exam timeta-
bles several
months ago so
that problems
could be avoid-
ed. Did they get
them? What do
you think.
Once they
received them a
few weeks ago,
the options
were put to our
friends in
S h c r f i e 1 d .
Either suspend
work, which
would cost about £3,200,000 as
crews were stood down, or resched-
ule exams. 'Reschedule exams!',
they cried, 'we can't do that, they've
been fixed for two years.' The Great
Voice of Reason
Hall was booked in January 1996 and
exact times finalised by March. Since
the Great Hall
is not used back
to back, all day
every day,
surely anyone
could have
foreseen that
the solution
was to arrange
the exams so as
to give Schal a
number days
| per week on
which they
could work
through with-
out disturbing
anyone, save
for the odd day-
dreamer in
E s t a t e s .
Secondly, why
was the han-
dover date for
the new build-
ing chosen as
June 16th? This
is a mere week
from the end of term and, try as I
might, I can't think of any good rea-
son for it. If the project at its incep-
tion had been scheduled to finish
later, much more flexibility would
have been gained. Still, dear reader,
you could give some people in
Sherfield all the flexibility of a
troupe of limbo dancers and they
would still snatch chaos from the
jaws of order.
This is sadly yet another example of
the conflicting agendas at IC. The:
academic departments for the most
part are world class, doing a sterling
job against a barrage of petty bureau-
cracy that flows from Sherfield
incessantly. I heard one of the
Sherfield engine room boys say that
IC would be great if it weren't for all
those academic departments. He said
it tongue in cheek, but it seems clear
that for some people in that ivory
tower teaching and education are not
the prime objectives of the College.
While departments received little
or no increase in their teaching grants
this year (2% overall), Sherfield
'headquarters' will receive an extra
5.8% next year, with the Rector,
albeit not personally, getting 11.7%.
This does not send the right message
to College. While we have the fourth
highest spend per student on central
administration and the highest on
premises, we come in at 29th on
Careers services and 15th on grants
to student organisations.
I'm all right, Jack?
