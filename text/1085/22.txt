22 LETTERS & EDITORIAL F E L I X FRIDAY 2 N D M A Y
Letters to Felix
Caldwell's Big Top
Dear Felix,
Last Friday I received a reconsti-
tuted wood-pulp information carrier
through my in-door external commu-
nications interface, bringing to my
attention the fact that my examina-
tions have been 'relocated to a rigid-
structured temporary marquee on
Prince's Gardens'. By the way, we're
doing our exams in a tent this year.
This is all part of the forthcoming
Exam Fest '97, an open-air event
which combines demanding exam
papers vital to one's future success
with the chance to see some of the
best live bands in Britain. As well as
great music there will be a motorcy-
cle rally and free helicopter rides
over the Prince's Gardens area. The
exam tent will be pitched midway
between the beer tent and the public
latrine, thus providing participants
with all the facilities they are likely to
need between events. Sales of illicit
drugs will not be a problem, as there
will be a substantial police presence
on site, who will also be on hand to
arrest anyone suspected of attempt-
ing to score 40% or more on a paper.
If all goes well, this will be the
public relations coup of the decade
for IC pic, who will then be able to
put into action the next exciting
phase of their master plan to create a
streamlined and cost-effective organ-
isation ready to proceed into the next
millennium. Draft proposals include
the renting of 'semi-permanent
weatherproof teaching blocks in
green-belt locations' (a couple of old
mobile classrooms on some playing
fields near Slough) for lectures, and
the provision of 'portable canvas-
based accommodation units' for stu-
dents.
Meanwhile the substantial savings
generated by no longer having to use
valuable college space on unprof-
itably educating students will be rein-
vested in the refurbishment of the
new South Kensington Conference
Centre. This will also allow the col-
lege to hire a professional
Euphemisms Officer to aid commu-
nication with students.
By the way, good luck with your
exams everybody!

Other suggestions for (better) uses
for the tent include Scout camps,
complete with camp-fires and
Kum Ba Ya, a touring production
of the Nicaraguan State Circus,
nightly productions of Barry
Manilow's latest musical,
Referendum Party rallies
Dear all..
I read with satisfaction the article
in Felix this morning (and was
pleased to see my letter printed at the
back). Although in fairness to the
college, the marquee is very impres-
sive and must have been very expen-
sive to hire (although obviously
cheaper than stopping building work
for a few weeks). The walls seem
solid and they don't blow in with the
wind, but the roof is still made from
some sort of material, so I hope it
isn't raining on the day of my exams
or the noise will be very offputting.
But I would like to make it clear
that I have not changed my tune. I am
still annoyed at the handling of this.
And I would like to thank the registry
for the notification I received this
morning (dated 22 April) of the
change of examination venue for
Monday. By voicing my displeasure,
I do not aim to incite bad feeling
between the student body and the
college - I strongly believe that such
feelings are counterproductive for
both parties. I just see no other way
to make the college see that its stu-
dents are unhappy with the lack of
importance assigned to them.
However, I am aware that Imperial
College is primarily a research insti-
tution, in receipt of an extremely
large proportion of the Higher
Education Funding Council's
research budget. So maybe in the
future there will be a move to convert
to a postgrad-only institution.
But at the moment, undergraduate
students do exist at IC and it would
be very nice if we could feel that we
were an important part of the college,
although with the general lack of evi-
dence of this it is far to easy to
become cynical.
While I am in the mood to contin-
ue in this somewhat political tone, I
shall now outline my own considered
opinion on how changes should be
made I believe that what the acade-
mics here really want to do is to get
on with their research. And so they
should. After all, research is extreme-
ly important. But to inconvenience
them, there's a load of students who
turn up from various places around
the world demanding knowledge.
But (for undergraduates, certainly)
they want the academics to explain
stuff which is fairly "old hat" to
them. It's boring - the academics
don't want to be wasting their time
explaining in simple terms the princi-
ples and ideas which they learnt
years ago. So what's the solution?
Well, my idea would be to employ
another level of staff - a layer of
trained educators. People whose sole
purpose within the college would be
to educate the incoming students.
These people would have to be
professionally trained as teachers, so
a certain level of teaching ability and
effective presentational techniques
would be more commonplace and the
owners of the brilliant academic
minds of Imperial College (and
everywhere else) would be able to
devote themselves to the pursuit of
further knowledge.
Anyway, if you've read this far,
thanks a lot. I must now leave and
further my knowledge of Chemistry
for my exams.
Regards,
Jon Walmsley {Chem II)
Dear Felix,
I have just left my first exam,
which was in the tent in Princes
Gardens and I would have to say that
it is the noisiest place I have ever had
to sit an exam, it is even noisier than
the hall in which 1 had to sit A level
mocks where an extension was being
built just the other side of a wooden
partition! I would appreciate you
passing on my comments to whoever
it may concern in Sherfield.

Dear Alex,
I found out about the marquee the
same way most people did, on Friday
morning. I would like to add some
thoughts to Jon Walmsleys excellent
letter in the last edition of 'Felix'. I
only scanned the letter as I was busy
phoning registry to ask the Assistant
Registrar (Exams) if this was a
bizarre practical joke. I did not at first
read the section where college says
that they will be sending copies to
peoples home addresses.
My parents were, to say the least,
less than impressed. My dad is an
academic and I imagine many other
students have parents in the 'trade' so
to speak. If my dad's reaction is any-
thing to judge by, Imperial College
are about to become the laughing
stock of the higher education sector.
This is not something any member of
college should take pleasure in, inter-
nal disputes notwithstanding.
Other Universities apparently con-
sider exam periods when planning
building work and arrange years in
advance to avoid these kind of prob-
lems. I do not believe that the estates
department did not realise exams
would be taking place during the
library work. The only conclusion I
can draw is that a decision was taken
somewhere in Sherfield, without
consultation (surprise, surprise), that
the building work is more important
than the welfare of students. If this is
the Imperial College position, fair
enough, but I feel that this should be
made clear, perhaps in the prospec-
tus....
Finally I am led to believe that one
can appeal against ones exam results
through the University of London
and that 'maladministration' [of the
exams] is acceptable grounds...
John Durrell (Physics IV)
The problem with the whole situa-
tion is that we all know that College
didn't choose the tent as the best
solution to the problem, rather this
was simply their only way out of a
horrendously embarrassing and
expensive mistake. To protect their
reputations and a huge amount of
College money, they chose to pass
the problem on to us, the students.
Now that the tent is in position, all
that we can do is to ensure that
College invigillators record all
problems (excessive noise, aller-
gies, adverse weather condi-
tions ) as they arise, and are
forced to take them into account -
otherwise they will lay themselves
open to the charge of
"Maladministration", as M r
Durrell suggests.
Change of emphasis
Dear Felix,
The response of your two main
columnists to my letter at the end of
last term, regarding Felix's political
bias, speaks volumes as to the size of
their respective egos. Hamish
Common took the honourable
approach, by exhorting students to
vote, no matter whom they favoured.
While spending considerable
amounts of his column talking about
himself, he at least accepted the idea
that neutrality was a virtuous concept
for the only universal student news-
paper of Imperial College.
Mr Simon Baker however is
another matter, unilaterally deciding
to abandon the long held reputation
of Felix as the unbiased voice of IC
students. His assertion that the politi-
cal leanings of the student newspaper
is set by its editorial is naive and
deliberately ignorant.
Even when editorials are a regular
part of a publication, its columns
always make a significant contribu-
tion to the tone of the newspaper -
and attempting to suggest otherwise
is avoidance of reality. With the rela-
tive dearth of editorials in this year's
Felix, columns contribute even more
to the journal's perceived prejudices.
It was with great sadness that I
