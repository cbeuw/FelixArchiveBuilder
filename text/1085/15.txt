There have been numerous ver-
sions of Les Miserables, Victor
Hugo's nineteenth century mas-
terpiece, but this interpretation
really stands out from the rest.
The film follows the life of a sim-
ple Frenchman during the
Second World War as he strug-
g l e s to rise from the criminal
desperation into which he has been forced. His struggle
between good and evil mirrors that which faced Hugo's
original hero, Jean Valjean. As the film develops, each
character finds himself in a situation similar to somebody
in the original book. This is cleverly directed and means
that although the film is long at over two hours there is
always some interesting theme developing. Even for
those who find subtitles a distraction the acting of the
lead is notably believable, and along with the script and
picturesque landscape this creates a memorable, high-
quality film.
V, the 1980s sci-fi series with
aliens arriving in huge flying
saucers intent on eating humans,
I was never shown in full on UK TV
due to the 1984 LA Olympics.
Now, 13 years later, is a chance
to buy the series and see if the
Resistance ever managed to rid
the world of the "visitors"...
Episode 6 - The Dissident
Alien leader Diana plans to
create a force field around Los Angeles so the Resistance
must spring into action once again. The only plot develop-
ment in this episode concerns the ongoing love triangle
between Kyle, star-child Elizabeth and her mother.
Otherwise it's all a bit tame with special effects which
were great in 1984 but now look dated.
Episode 7 - Visitor's Choice
The alien visitors have invented the ultimate human-
processing device and there's problems for rebel Kyle,
who is captured and tortured by his own father. Again,
the plot is moving along very slowly with too much
emphasis on action scenes and not enough on the
Resistance's plans to permanently defeat the Visitors.
The Birdcage tells a tale about
the introduction of a man's future
in-laws to his bizarre parents.
Whilst Val's girlfriend's father is a
US senator who campaigns for
higher moral standards, his own
parents' lifestyle couldn't be more
different. His dad, played by
Robin Williams, is Jewish, gay
and owns a drag-club while his "mother" is Albert, the
resplendent star of the club. The film is centred around
the build-up to the big meeting and there are many gen-
uinely funny moments as Albert tries to act more manly
so he can pose as Val's uncle. The campness of the
entire cast is overplayed but not so much that it's irritating
and Gene Hackman is excellent as the right-wing
Republican. The glitzy setting of Miami is a perfect back-
drop to these outrageous characters and contributes to
the overall impression that the cast are probably enjoying
themselves just as much as the audience.
Broken Arrow, made at the crest
of John Travolta's latest wave,
gives him his first real role as a
villain. As treachorous Major
Deakins in the US Air Force he
steals a stealth bomber carrying
nuclear warheads in an extortion
bid which puts millions of lives in
danger. Naturally, only one man
can stop him and this is Riley
Hale, played by Christian Slater,

Odeon Marble Arch
his one-time pupil who must use everything he learnt
from his mentor to destroy him. This is, in a nutshell, com-
plete and utter nonsense of the first degree. It's got non-
stop action, plenty of explosions and the ubiquitous red
flashing timer on the bomb and nothing else. Travolta
isn't even particularly good as the villain, seeming to just
cruise through the film rather than develop his character,
although, to be fair, the script gives hm little choice. Slater
is fine although again there's nothing for him to work
with. There's also a real risk of getting dizzy from all the
circling the camera does but thafs typical of John Woo,
the director. Still, if ifs explosions and mindlessness you're Odeon Kensington
after then this will do fine
