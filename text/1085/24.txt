IC football secure
spiritual victory
The scoreline of this game is (once
more) a poor reflection of the true
game. Our lads, clearly the superior
side were beset by horrific setbacks
throughout the match. Slough kicked
off and soon brought the ball to our
end of the pitch. There they proceed-
ed to kick it between the posts.
Staggeringly, the referee declared
this a goal, just the first of many sim-
ilar injustices that took place all
through the game. Then, no sooner
had the game resumed, than a Slough
player tackled Ed "regularly gets
drugged out of his head" and took the
ball from him. This was very mean
since Ed was clearly still playing
with the ball at the time. Yet the ref-
eree stoutly refused to blow his whis-
tle. The rest of the match continued
in this vein. Despite playing far bet-
ter football, Slough repeatedly con-
founded us with such unsporting
tricks as kicking the ball to another
of their players when we tried to
tackle them.
Our best chance came late in the
second half when Stan "takes as
many drugs as he can" cleverly
threatened to scream until he wet
himself unless we were allowed a
shot at goal. The Slough defenders
stepped aside, leaving top striker
Doug "does lots of drug(s)" a fan-
tastic chance to salvage something.
Unfortunately after last week's
match, Doug went to the "seven
days, one drum beat, no discernable
tune" party at popular rave venue
The Sewer. In attempting to kick the
ball, he lost balance and collapsed.
Witnesses report that he was asleep
before he hit the ground.
All in all an unsatisfactory result
but definitely not our fault, honest.

ULU Judo one step
short of second national
gold
On the 9th of March, the U L U judo
team defended their 95-96 BUSA
Championship title.
After a disappointing outcome in
the individual fights on the previous
day, including several injuries, the
team morale was somewhat low. But
the spirit picked up after a 5-0 win in
the first fight. Aris Tagalakis (Royal
Holloway), Khalid Faiz (UCL),
George Tsikouras, Steffen
Fredensdorf and Oyvind Fikel and
(all IC) were part of the U L U five-
men team, defeating several univer-
sities, including strong teams from
Loughborough and Glasgow. In the
final, U.W.I.C (Wales) proved to be
slightly better, winning 3-2, and
hence taking gold.
This year, U L U also had a
women's team, but was unsuccessful
due to injuries from the individual
fights on the previous day.
Despite losing valuable members
of the team since last year, good
recruiting and this important result
clearly has shown that the IC judo
squad still is maintaining its high
standards.
Well done to the U L U team and
IC players for winning Silver in what
was called "the most spectacular and
talented tournament ever seen at the
BUSA games..."
Creditable support for
IC rowers
As part of their team 2000 project,
Barclaycard are providing sponsor-
ship for four members of the
Imperial College Union Rowing
squad.
The sponsorships are organised on
a three tier system, developing
potential British sports stars for the
2000 Olympiad in Sydney, and pro-
viding for the future of British sport
into the next millennium.
Consequently, Simon Dennis,
Richard Dunne, Lewis Attwell and
Stavros Eyre, who are all currently in
training with the Olympic team, have
been awarded a total of £2800 to fos-
ter their future development. All four
demonstrated their ability last year,
when they rowed to team gold at the
Under 23 World Championships.
Football fourths return
from the dead
The performance was immaterial, all
that mattered was the result, and
thankfully after trailing 2-0 half-way
through the second-half the victory
was obtained.
The equation is now simple - our
final game of the season decides
whether we are champions, and
secure promotion, or also-rans des-
tined to languish on the scrap-heap
of football history with San Marino
and Watford.
That afternoon, we showed great
character to win. Two sloppy goals
were conceded and perhaps we
would have collapsed earlier in the
season, but we climbed out of
reverse and eventually found our
way into fifth gear. Dazzla Darren
led the fight back, dominating the
attacks, first converting a cross from
Ryan, and then lobbing the keeper in
a shot reminiscent of Asprilla at his
best. The winner was scored a few
minutes from time, with Darren
again dribbling to the bye-line and
crossing to the back post. Leaping
like a salmon in spring, Ryan (the
shortest player on the field) made no
mistake with a clinical finish.
His overall performance was mag-
nificent - after suffering an early
injury he bravely battled on and
deservedly scored the winner thanks
to his unselfish running.
Paul also played a crucial part, as
indeed he has done all season, in this
game clearing off the line in the last
minute! This was, needless to say,
caused by a mistake from Captain
Stuart, who, after losing all his kit
only just managed to get both his
brain cells into gear and direct his
team to the game.
