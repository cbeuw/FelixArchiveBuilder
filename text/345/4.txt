Church Commission
makes more homeless
The Church Commis-
sion intend to evict 20
people onto the streets,
from two of their proper-
ties—38 and 40 Formosa
Street, W 9 . The reason
for this eviction (which is
some months earlier than
the Church Commission
originally indicated to the
occupants) is so that the
Church Commission can
go ahead and convert the
property into expensive
flats. These flats will be
beyond the means of most
people i n London and will
only be built at the ex-
pense of the homeless,
since the Church C o m -
mission has given n o offer
of new accommodation to
the would-be homeless
people (which include tea-
chers, students, craftsmen
and unemployed) it i n -
tends to evict.
The building of expen-
sive flats at the expense
of the homeless must be
stopped; and where it is
not the expensive flats
should be taken over by
the homeless — as hap-
pened recently in 44 Bar-
tholomew Road, Kentish
Town. If Councils are
serious about dealing with
homelessness they will
buy-up empty properties
in the hands of specula-
tors, whether or not they
have been converted into
expensive flats, and allow
working people to use
them.
In Westminster 1 in 8
houses currently stand
empty and a large propor-
tion of these are Church
Commission property,
meanwhile there are 7,800
people on Westminster
waiting list, and G O D
knows how many more
not even on the lists. Yet
in this situation the
Church Commission i n -
tends to increase home-
lessness and build more
flats that people in need
cannot afford.
Squatters and tenants
in the M a i d a Hill A r e a
(Elgin Avenue, Formosa
Street, Walterton Road,
W9 etc.) clearly recognise
that the Church Commis-1
sion is acting directly
against the interests of
the fight for decent hous-
ing for all; and that their
eviction threats are to be
doubly opposed because
if the Church Commission
get away with their
schemes i n Formosa
Street then the G L C will
be encouraged to sharpen
its attack against the
homeless in the whole
area.

Christian Scientists
indicted for conspiracy

and J O H N E H R L I C H -
IA A N N ex White House
Domestic Adviser and
Chief-of-Staff respectively
whose infamy has spread
throughout _the world for
their part i n the Water-
gate affair are both de-
vout Christian Scientists.
Haldeman was indicted
for conspiracy to burgle
the office of Daniel Elis-
bergs' psychiatrist- H e
also set u p the sinister
task force of "plumbers"
w h o led the Watergate
break-in and contravened
every rule of bourgeois
democracy by bugging
the Democrat convention
of last year.
Ehrlichmann who was
indicted for conspiracy,
.'helped draw up the
White House '"enemies
list" containing names of
hundreds of journalists,
trade unionists, lawyers,
academics, artists and
politicians, who the ad-
ministration wanted "to
get". T h e list included
such terrifying subversiv-
es, obviously backed by
Moscow gold, as Jane
Fonda.
A Christian Scientist
spokesman said that he
could not comment on the
affair.
Presumably the First
Church of Christ, .Scientist
in opulent Boston, Mas-
sachusetts are now the
only people apart from a
few secular hard liners re-
actionaries who believed
Nixon when he astound-
ed the world with his
statement that he had
been unable to record the
discussion in the Oval
R o o m with John Dean 111
(former White House
counsel) and the phone
conversation with ex-At-
torney General John Mit-
chell just after the Water-
gate break-in.
Unfortunately for H a l -
deman as well, is this lat-
est ploy by Nixon, for
three months ago he testi-
fied under oath to having
heard the recording made
with Dean — he even said
the sound quality was
good!
These two recordings
were the only ones that
could incriminate N i x o n
in the Watergate conspir-
acy and its cover-up, and
of a l l ' the miles of tape
that has recorded every
rustle in the White House
since he took office —
they are the only two he
couldn't record due to a
"technical malfunction".
O h well, the lure of the
flesh . . .
Manfred Man's Earth-
band have been a hard-
working band, having
'been almost continually
on the circuit since they
formed over a year ago.
This probably explains
why their performance at
the Great H a l l on Satur-
day was quite different
from that of a year ago.
They opened the even-
ing with " M e r c u r y " con-
taining four shortish solos,
and capturing the aud-
ience from the start. They
continued much in the
same vein, their long
pieces making full use of
cresendoes, echoes and
volume contrast, most of
their music b;ing used to
plug (and unders.andably
so) their new a'bum "Sol-
ar Fire".
"Mighty Oviinn" was
included in their set, even
if the title was only for
sentimental value as it was
hardly recognisable as the
classic from the days of
" P o o W a a Diddy".
O n the whole they
were much appreciated,
though perhaps their use
of pre-recorded tapes of
church bells and choral
singing was not to the best
effect, and they came back
for two encores. T h e first
was a bit of a n anticlim-
ax, being only a straight
rock number, though the
second time they did in-
evitably, though appar-
e n t l y rather reluctantly,
"Joybringer", which had
hardly any alterations to
the single version:
The support band, Uni-
corn had earlier given a
competent varied perfor-
mance, clarity seeming to
be their theme, their play
not being so loud as to
distort-

Parliament and Congress
T h i s just-published
Quartet edition of Parlia-
ment and Con j . ess (1972
first edition) was written
by two clerks of the
House of Commons who
also have experience of
the U S . Congress. They
wrote it to describe 'the
working methods of each
legislature in as much dc-
tal as the practitioners
and students of each may
require" (p.3) in an objec-
tive manner not intended
to show that one system
is better or worse than
the other. They simply
felt that a comparative
study of the two constitu-
tional systems would be
useful.
The work itself is an
authoritative one using a
compare-contrast techni-
que of the major elements
of the two legislatures
such as leadership, mem-
bership, finance, and
scrutiny and control of
the Executive, T h e book
covers some 400 pages
but is not ponderous;
rather it is informative, in-
teresting and readable.
Thus, not just those i n -
volved in or students of
politics would want to
read it; it also caters to a
wider public of those who
might be interested in
finding out the' strengths
and weaknesses of each
system against an histori-
cal background.
Some of the more fas-
cinating points of differ-
ence between the two sys-
tems are listed below.
(1) Congress has a wid-
er distribution of power,
i.e. the Senate and House
have "broadly equal
powers and rights" (p9).
(2) Whereas the prime
minister is a leader of the
party winning a majority
of' seats in the House
which means the Govern-
ment can act in the "spir-
it" of that party, i.e. trans-
lating the message into
governmental terms — in
Congress the Executive is
separated from the legisla-
ture and is often at logger-
heads with it.
(3) Britain is a more
compact political unit
and ends to concentrate
on national issues while
the U.S. is more diffuse
with preoccupation for
local or state issues-
(4) The U.S. pays more
to its legislators keeping
in mind the differences in
scale of representation
and in function, i e . Con-
gressmen represent more
people and have more
duties.
Finally, the book does
have a "few weaknesses
such as repetition of cer-
tain points, a lack of con-
clusions, suggestions on
improving or rehauling
either or both systems,
and in-depth study of the
faults of these two forms
of popular representation.
But, the book is long
enough as it is and not in-
tended as a critical evalu-
ation and improvement
plan for Parliament and
Congress.

Once upon a time, people could afford to go
freely on the streets or pavements, cross them or walk
along them, relying on their own senses, instincts,
intelligence, decision making, risk criteria, calcula-
tions, etc., thus healthily exercising their faculties and
giving "private attention" to each individual situa-
ton with a m a x i m u m efficiency from the humane
point of view, both at individual and community
levels (beat that!).
Then the fast motor vehicle appeared in large
numbers in the cities bringing privilege to a few and
thus accelerating the mode of life for all those who
didn't want or couldn't afford to lag too far behind,
hence deteriorating the situation as a whole.
A s the prevailing institutions were geared to i n -
crease the privilege of the already privileged (as they
still normally are), the traffic lights were an "obvious"
result. Traffic lights facilitated the introduction of the
motor car, they contributed to increased production
of both needs and the things to satisfy them, heading
the list of which are the motor car and the traffic
lights!!, thus increasing our holy G.N.P. O n the other
hand, traffic lights obstruct pavements (instead of
roads which they're serving), obstruct the view, look
horrible, oblige pedestrians to go to the corner o f
the street and wait just to cross a road, and cost mon-
ey to the society as a whole either directly by taxing
everyone or indirectly by having to raise the salaries or
profits of those who o w n a car to allow them to pay
the necessary road taxes.
But most important, they take from a normal indi-
vidual (either pedestrian or driver) the capacity t o
decide whether or not to cross a road (or to drive
ahead in view of a pedestrian) and the responsibility
for himself and for others, hence rendering h i m i n -
capable and irresponsible; they also inculcate the
"recognition" of the "impossibility" to cross the road,
by means of an inaccurate symbol that will be wrong
many times. T h e main consequences of this are: 1
— telling the man that the machine is superior to him
and 2 — deploring the man of his right to healthily
use his senses, his intelligence and responsibility sense,
thus conditioning him, controlling h i m and making
him "addict" to the traffic lights, all this on the
grounds that only in this way can the motor car be
introduced and still be successful for part of the popu-
lation at the expense of the whole. It could be alleged
that a normal driver could not cope with the traffic
were it not for the traffic lights, but what this means
is that traffic lights are only hiding another symptom
of the impossibility of solving the transportation
problem with high speeds, privilege, and dangerous
motor cars. After some time using the new device,
the capacity of own decision begins atrophying and
the addiction increases, that is, increased control of
people at their own expense, ie. enslavement!
Proof of our addiction are the nowadays popular
traffic jams caused by the failure of a single set of
lights; and the accidents on motorways involving large
numbers of vehicles, show the inability of drivers to
cope with "unofficial" situations.
Similar analysis may be applied to most of the
"revolutionary" devices products of the industrial
"revolution". I prefer to call it the Green-Red "Revo-
lution" and define it as the systematic substitution of
man's abilities, senses and mechanisms by institutions,
organisations, machines or apparatus, that lead to the
gradual atrophy of the formers and addiction to o r
dependence on the latters with the consequent control
or manipulation of human masses and finally lead-
ing to some kind of enslavement-
The Green-Red "Revolution" (which is no revolu-
tion) includes then the "amplified muscle power" and
the "amplifying the brain power" (electronics) men-
tioned by M r . Sarnoff i n his commemoration day
speech, that, by the way, have resulted in the atomic
bomb and in the electronic battlefield used in Viet-
nam.
The G - R " R " thus leads to waste and pollution,
for it creates nothing new, but substitutes all what
exists in natural balance, for something that is worse
" b u t " inefficient.
Another typical example of the G - R " R " is the
advantage that underdeveloped countries could take
of the electronic "revolution" mentioned by M r . Sarn-
off. Those people affected would have to learn new
symbols, means, and kinds of communication thus
atrophying their traditional ones; the developed world
would "naturally" keep the patents and monopolies,
thus controlling the kind of "revolution" to their own
advantage; once a certain number of such devices is
introduced, addiction begins to play a role until the
whole thing takes the all too familiar form of
"under development".
