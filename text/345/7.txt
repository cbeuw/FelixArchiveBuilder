The Law of Freedom
Gerrard Winstanley: 'The Law of
Freedom and Other Writings', ed.
Christopher Hill. Pelican Classic
(published 25th October). 75p.
O n Sunday 1st A p r i l 1649, a group
of poor m e n collected at St. George's
H i l l , Walton-upon-Thames, a n d began
to d i g the wasteland, sowing corn, par-
snips, carrots and beans; and i n so
doing Gerrard Winstanley and his fel-
low Diggers established the first com-
munist colony. They maintained that the
feudal lords' rights to the commons and
wastelands had been cut off with K i n g
Charles' head.
The colony struggled against contin-
uous harassment from the local pro-
perty-owners. Legal attacks i n the
courts at Kingston were complemented
by more blatant raids in which crops
and huts were destroyed, animals killed,
and people beaten. A boycott was
organised to bring financial pressure
to bear, and o n more than one occa-
sion troops were called in to assist i n
the ransacking. Nevertheless the com-
mune managed to survive a full year,
with similar settlements of Diggers in at
least nine other English counties.
The Digger (or True Leveller) move-
ment, representing a growing number
of propertiless, was the most radical
within the English revolution. Their
direct actions towards bringing the land
under c o m m u n i t y ' c o n t r o l came at a
time when the radical threat to the
new bourgeois order under Cromwell
had not yet been defeated. T h e most
important group on the left were i n fact
the Levellers, a strongly democratic
movement of the petit-bourgeoisie, w h o
however d i d not o n the whole support
the Diggers' communist doctrines.
" T h e L a w of Freedom and Other
Writings" contains political pamphlets
by Gerrard Winstanley, written on
behalf of the St. George's H i l l Diggers,
as well as other major works of social
criticism. M o s t of his ideas o n religion,
the Church, education and government
are progressive b y modern standards,
and on the land question, which he
regarded central to all issues, he would
clearly be a revolutionary today. H e
wanted a non-competitive, communal
society, insisting that political freedom
is impossible without economic equality,
which could only be attained by the
abolition of private property and wage
labour.
H e writes i n a vigorous, refreshing
style, with a deep sense of justice that
can't fail to inspire the reader. The book
is wholeheartedly recommended.
Christopher H i l l , who in such books
as " T h e English Revolution 1640" has
done much to counter the school his-
tory book version of the seventeenth
century, has written a lucid introduc-
tion. Winstanley and the Diggers are put
in their political and historical context,
and Winstanley is thoroughly assessed
from a philosophical and literary stand-
point. T h e introduction itself warrants
buying the book.

NOT QUITE DEAD
The two albums reviewed below have
both been out for some time and have
faded from obscurity to total obscurity
i n the meanwhile. N o doubt they will
be deleted i n due course so n o w is your
chance to grab two brilliant albums.
M I C K E Y H A R T : R O L L I N G
T H U N D E R (Warner Bros.)
Mickey Hart was a drummer with
the Grateful Dead from 1967 to 1971
and though no longer playing gigs with
the band he has obviously kept in touch
with West-coast musicians as well as
branching out with Indian influences.
W i t h M i c k e y H a r t on the album are
most of the Dead, Grace Slick, Steve
Stills, John Cippofina, David Frleberg
and many others.
A number of star names shoved to-
gether do not guarantee excellence and
could easily degenerate into just the
opposite but M i c k e y Hart is in full
control and the music is subtly and
completely co-ordinated.
The contents are varied, ranging from
Ithe harmonies of "Playing in the
B a n d " to the brilliant tabla of " G r a n -
ma's Cookies". Side 1 ends with close
harmonies and delicate instrumentation
on " B l i n d J o h n " , Grace Slick's voice
lurks in the background merging with
both the vocals and the music. Side 2
includes "Deep, wide and frequent" fea-
turing the "Tower of Power H o r n Sec-
tion'" and Cippolina's guitar in a bright
jazzy number.. 'Pump Song' naturally
includes a pump as part of the ryhlhm
section and this works surprisingly well.
The vocals here are Bob Wier's, appro-
priately enough since it's his song and
makes an appearance on his own 'solo'
.iliium as " T h e :
Greatest Story Ever,
T o l d " . M y favourite track is "Fletcher
C a t n a b y " where distorted vocals com-
bine with horns to produce a unique
and beautiful sound.
Overall this is a tremendous album
with no track to fault it. Don't miss it
a second time round.
B O B W I E R : A C E (Warner Bros.)
Supposedly a solo album by Bob
Wier of the Grateful Dead but i n fact
includes a l l the Dead.
The immediate thing you notice about
this album is how very relaxed it is.
The musical precision is u p to the
Dead's usual high standard but techni-
cal brilliance is combined with a strong-
ly tangible enjoyment of what they are
doing.
The tracks are characteristic Grate-
ful Dead material of the current 'vin-
tage'. A l l are written by Bob Wier with
lyrics by Robert Hunter or R o n Bar-
low.
A lively version of " T h e Greatest
Story Ever T o l d " opens the album.
" B l a c k Throated W i n d " and " L o o k s
L i k e R a i n " move along in low gear and
are characteristically introspective. Side
1 ends with a beautiful and lyrical ver-
sion of "Playing in the Band", this is
what the Grateful Dead are all about.
Side 2 includes the definitely non-
bluesy " M e x i c a l i Blues" and " O n e more
Saturday Night" which blasts along full
of the party spirit. The album ends
with "Cassidy", an enchanting song
which again depends on the perfect
combination of vocal and music which
the Dead always achieve.
The addition of Keith Godchaux on
Piano makes a great improvement to
the 'sound' of the band but it is a pity
that Donna Godchaux. is not more pro-
minent, more often, on "chick vocals".
Again this is an excellent album â€”
as the song says "the one thing we
need is a left-hand monkey wrench".
R I C H A R D S Z C Z E P A N S K I
"The Naked Face"
Sidney Sheldon, P a h 30p I
Well, y o u know how it is . . I ' d '
jjust sat down after a long dreary day,
and while the macaroni cheese was
having a quick seethe in the oven I
decided to relax with a couple of chap-
ters of T h e Naked Face', "just another
deteotjive mystery story", I thought.
A t one a.m., crawling into bed with
fingernails bitten to the quick, I
thought otherwise. This book is dan-
gerous. Don't start it unless you're sure
of a couple of hours to yourself, a n d
don't give it to anyone whose company
you can't d o without for a while. It's
hot stuff, fast moving, and the best
straightforward thriller I've read this
year. ( C A N D I )
Record Review
Focus: A T T H E R A I N B O W
(Polydor 2442 118)
Side 1
(1) Focus III
(2) Answers? Questions! Questions?
Answers!
(3) Focus II.
Side 2
(1) Eruption (Excerpt)
(2) Hocus Pocus
(3) Sylvia
(4) Hocus Pocus (Reprise)
I saw Focus live about a year ago,
just as they were breaking through i n
this country. A flat mate already owned
the two Focus albums available at that
time, and so I was familiar with their
recorded work. T h e live performance
convinced me that they had a lot more
to offer than had been apparent from
their studio material, a n d I know that
this opinion is shared b y most of the
'hard core' Focus fans. Once they had
established themselves both here and i n
America it was inevitable that a live
album would be released, and here it
is. It was recorded o n M a y 5th of this
year at T h e R a i n b o w Theatre, with the
material coming from the Moving
Waves and Focus III albums.
The first side opens with Focus H I ,
a gentle track from the Focus III album.
This comes over very nicely, following
this is Answers? Questions! Questions?
Answers!, also from the Focus H i
album. This track features some furi-
ous guitar playing from J a n A k k e r -
man. T h e first side closes with Focus
II, which again comes across well.
Side two features the 'Eruption'
theme from the M o v i n g Waves album,
and is followed by a speedy version
of the favourite Hocus Pocus. O n this
track they seem to lose cohesiveness,
because they strive to play too quickly.
A burst of applause signifies the end
of the set, and Sylvia is provided as a n
encore. F o r me, this is the best track
off the album, and is superbly deliv-
ered. T h e end of Sylvia blends into a
reprise of Hocus Pocus.
T o be quite honest, I was a little bit
disappointed with the album, and d o
not think it really captured them at
their best. I a m not a n ardent Focus
fan, and hence may be a little bit too
critical.
The album is an absolute must for all
Focus fans, and anybody interested i n
them at a l l should give the album a
careful listen. A final point, for any H i -
F i buffs who may listen to the album,
is that the recording itself is not abso-
lutely first class. Suffice it to say T
have heard better recordings of live
material.

HAPPY DEATH
Albert Camus, Penguin 25p.
This book published posthumously
will be identified by many as a text i n
which Camus failed to find cohesion,
abandoned as a book but which is
very interesting is understanding the
development of the outsider.
A s i n T h e Outsider the book opens
with Patrice Mersault, whose story is
to learn of a murder and ends with his
own death.
His story is of the experiment he
makes out of his life, a search for hap-
piness, the only ideal he recognises and
which leads h i m o n a alienated journey
in persuit of this misunderstood concept.
A t no point i n the book is Camus'
creative sense i n Construction of phrase
and sentence anything but his o w n ex-
cellent best. Different scenes however
are not brought together well leaving
them, though individually highly devel-
oped, isolated a n d uncertain. This I
believe to have been Camus' own opin-
ion which led h i m to give up work o n
the book, but then later to bring the
ideas, the driving force of this work.
to fruition i n his accepted classic 'The
Outsider'.
Some of the opening scenes are indeed
identical with corresponding ones in
The Outsider, though Camus seems to
have done more than change his presen-
tation of his ideas, certainly the empha-
sis and possibly the ideas have changed
between the books.
It was interesting to find Mersault
when finally able to begin his experi-
ment having left all his connections with
the past, undergoing experiences which
have a flavour extremely close to those
tasted lin Sartres "Nausea".
It would seem the person unacquain-
ted with Camus, Nobel Laureate, would
do better to read one of his established
classics if only because they will find
more people with whom they "can dis-
cuss the book whereas this book must
hold most of its interest in being addi-
tional material to study Camus and his
literature.
