Whoops!
Dear Sir,
W i t h reference Ito your
article of Felix Oct .30th,
1973.
I profess no extra-
ordinary mathematical
powers, but surely if

Grievances
Sir,
What has happened to
Felix, or is it now the I C
Star? While it is interest-
ing to know what the
views of minority political
groups are, it is boring to
read them week after
week. Surely the job of
the editor of Felix is to
produce a newspaper that
is of Interest to the college
as a whole and not air
his own revolutionary
ideas. There is no 'What's
O n ' column and little
news of matters of
general interest other
than grants and refectory
prices. Of course we are,
cblighted to be so well in-
formed of grievances, sit-
ins etc. at other colleges
and universities, but what
about IC? C a n we not
have a paper that informs
people what is going on
here, apart from political
events? In a college this
size there can hardly be a
lack of news, so why don't
we hear it?

Amnesty
International
Dear A l i ,
Most readers of Felix
are probably unaware of
the fact that we now have
our own Amnesty Inter-
national G r o u p here in
college. Amnesty Inter-
national is an independent
organisation which cam-
paigns strongly for the re-
lease of people i m -
prisoned anywhere in the
world for their non-viol-
ent expression of political
or religious beliefs, or for
their racial or ethnic
origin. There are over a
thousand such groups
throughout the world; and
in the 12 years of its exis-
tence Amnesty Inter-
national has secured the
release of over 500
prisoners.
O u r own group (like
every group) has adopted
three prisoners of con-
science, and we are work-
ing for their release, by ap-
peals, etc. W e need more
members to help us i n the
campaign. Anyone inter-
ested should come along
to the weekly meetings at
7 p.m. on Wednesdays in
the Upper Lounge of the
Union, or should contact
one of us:

Contradiction
Sir,
Y o u appear to be get-
ting very few letters for
Felix, and since I a m not
an idealist as you sug-
gested i n your reply to my
last letter, let ithe corres-
pondence continue.
There is a definite con-
tradiction in what you
say i n your editorial and
in your reply to my last
letter. In the latter you
say you wish Ito "break
the working class from
reformism by calling for
the election of a " L a b o u r
government pledged to
socialist policies". That is,
you are backing reform-
ism in order to expose it,
for whether Labour poli-
cies are socialist or not,
Labour certainly stands
for reforms not revolu-
tion. O n the other hand
in your editorial you say
that a reformist grants
campaign (i.e. for a
grants increase not for the
overthrow of the T o r y
government) should not
be undertaken and here
you reject l e a r n i n g
through practice that-"re-
formism leads to defeat"
saying that we have al-
ready learned-this.
Surely in ithe case of the
grants campaign this is
not the case. The £20 i n -
crease was taken as an
indication that we can
a c h i e v e some gains,
though temporary, by
such campaigns and there-
fore was not a defeat W e
did not force the Tories
to resign but this was
never our aim. I agree
that one achieves nothing
in the long term by re-
formism but that is not
what you are saying.
A s for the case of the
Labour Party, I explained
two weeks ago why it was
blantantly obvious al-
ready from the experi-
ence of the last six Labour
governments that L a b o u r
is not socialist. Y o u diid
not answer these points.
So why do you, lin contra-
diction with your position
on the grants campaign,
conltinue to deceive the
working class and encour-
age reformism by back-
ing Ithe L a b o u r Party?
The capitalist class uses
the L a b o u r to deceive the
workers, why do you,
who claim to be revolu-
tionaries, do the same? If
you want socialism, why
don't you say so openly
and campaign for support
on that basis and try to
bring real revolutionary
politics to the working
Class? O r would your
membership fall?
A s for democratic cen-
tralism i n the S.L.L.,
former members of the
S.L.L. Central Committee
have said that major poli-
tical decisions had already
been made above even
that level (by Gerry
Healy?), i.e. there was no
democratic centralism on
the Central Committee let
alone i n the rest of the
organisation.
Y o u r sincerely,
K A T H L E E N

Sir,
M a y I express my
thanks to all the stud-
ents, both for the oppor-
tunity to speak at your
meeting and the cour-
tesy that was s h o w n to-
w a r d s me by all those
present. I trust that I d i d
something to clear the
air and also cemented
the g o o d relations that
exist between the
Students U n i o n a n d

During the w e e k e n d
we only managed to
scratch the surface of
the w h o l e issue of
crime, w e also managed
to d i s c u s s many other
topics and came away
wondering w h y T o u c h -
stone weekends were so
few and far between.
The weekends are cer-
tainly very" enjoyable if
only for the sake of the
food and the very beau-
tiful W i n d s o r Park.

(Union Directory)
A t laSt! The moment you've all been watting for,
specially produced at enormous expense, the U n i o n
Directory will be available this week i n the U n i o n
Office. Don't miss it. Special technicolour edition.
Pest Control
Also at enormous expense a new Pest Control firm
started work on October 1st. After a meeting last
week, they appear to be very efficient and they have
really gone to town already. Watch out for further
instalments i n later copies.
Cycle Thieves
It appears that the thieves are still hard at work
stealing new bicycles from college. A s a n addition to
my earlier warning the college security office have
suggested that all owners of bicycles have them ade-
quately insured against theft.
Complaints Officers
Three refectory complaints officers are needed.
Their job is to be i n charge of the complaints book
in South Side, College B l o c k and the U n i o n and
report o n the same. W i l l interested people please see
me in the U n i o n office.
Talking of refectory, there is a refectory committee
meeting this week. A g a i n , i f you have any complaints
you wish passed on, please see me before Thursday.
Christmas H a l l Dinner
Bookings are now being taken for the above. If
you wish to go to this excellent value meal please

regrets to have to say that it cannot serve I C students
in their canteen. This is not because they don't like I C
students; under any other circumstances they are very
pleased to get to know you, but they only have ona
very small outdated canteen and particularly at lunch
time they just cannot cope even with their own.

Please take ndtice of this — you know what the
queues are i k e at lunchtime here and they're even
worse at R C M .
