N E W S P A P E R O F IMPERIAL C O L L E G E UNION
F R E E ! ISSUE No. 345
A C C 5%
At the U G M last Thursday IC voted to accept the 5% increase in
refectory prices and that "no direct or indirect action is taken to
oppose it".
Amendments were
made by the YSSS,
the C P and the I M G
and were all defeated.
Pete Lambert, propos-
ing the Y S S S a m e n d -
ment, pointed out that
the 'inflation w h i c h
necessitated the in-
crease in refectory
prices came from the
economic crisis of capi-
talism a n d w o u l d con-
tinue to soar.
Paul W a t k i n s , propos-
ing the C P a m e n d m e n t
argued that the students
had to fight the price
rises a n d that the U G C
self - financing rulings,
w h i c h forbade subsidies
to refectories, c o u l d be
broken with a petition
and a d e m o to the
Governing Body.
M r . Corbyn, propos-
ing the I M G amendment,
said that militant action
was needed to bring
d o w n the price i n -
creases. H e caused a
certain amount of con-
troversy w h e n h e e m -
phasised the original
motion being backed by
mysterious people on
navy scholarships.
He w a s challenged by
Martin Turner over alleg-
ing support from I'CNUPE
branch.
M r . R o n P a r k e r
( I C N U P E Chief Shop
Steward) then w a s i n -
vited to speak to clarify
his union branch's posi-
tion.
He s t a t e d that
I C N U P E were against
any price increases
whatsoever, â€¢ but that
I C N U P E members were
not to conflict w i t h the
students over the change
tables. H e felt that the
college authorities were
using N U P E members as
" p a w n s " in what w a s an
affair b et w e e n the
authorities a n d the stu-
dents.
N o r m . Sayles pro-
posed that more discus-
sion should take place
w h e n a move to a vote
on the orginal motion
was called.
Ron Kill challenged
the chair but w a s unsuc-
cessful.
M r . Hobbs spoke
(vaguely?) for the mo-
tion arguing that the
majority of the students
were against any form of
action but needed higher
grants.
Trevor Phillips spoke
against the motion argu-
ing, after consultation
with M s . Attenborough,
that the U G C rules were
unworkable in a time of
inflation a n d should be
removed. Dave Sinclair
s u m m e d up and the mo-
tion taken in parts as
proposed by John Lane
was passed in toto.
M . Cooper proposed a
censure motion on S o c
Soc deploring them " a n d
their I M G c r o n i e s " (Ed.'s
note: S o c S o c doesn't
exist any more. The C P
and I M G n o w run a dis-
cussion group called
Socialist Forum) for
c a r r y i n g out union
policy.
J o c k Veall spoke
against but the motion
w a s carried. '.
The quorum w a s chal-
lenged successfully a n d
the U G M closed at 2.25
p.m.
TO ALL
I.C.N.U.P.E.
MEMBERS
A l l of y o u are no
doubt aware of the de-
cision of a section of the
student body to refrain
from paying the latest
refectory price increases.
I.C.N.U.P.E. are not at
the present time i n -
volved in this dispute
and w e regard this issue
as being o n e that con-
cerns the students'
Union a n d the I.C. Re-
fectory Committee. Most
of our members are be-
ing used as pawns in
this dispute a n d w e are
not prepared to tolerate
this. W e therefore i n -
struct all our members in
the refectories to carry
out their normal duties
and not b e c o m e involved
in this dispute. A n y
efforts on the part of the
refectory management
w h i c h w i l l involve y o u i n
any form of conflict w i t h
the students s h o u l d b e
reported to a U n i o n
officer. Y o u have the full
backing of your U n i o n i n
this matter.
