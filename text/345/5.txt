TOUCHSTONE
, Touchstone weekends
are organised to give
scientists the oppor-
tunity to think about
problems they know
they can never solve.
The weekend is spent
discussing life and one
comes away aware of
yet another insoluble
problem. The reward
comes from sharing the
sense of bewilderment,
and perhaps taking cover
behind someone else's
troubles. Some might
even be m o t i v a t e d
enough to do something.
The last Touchstone w a s
concerned w i t h ' R a d i c a l
Alternatives to P r i s o n ' .
In dealing w i t h prisons
the attitude of society
towards crime and the
nature of crime have to
be questioned. There is
no fundamental law of
human nature w h i c h can
define corect social be-
haviour. Rules against
murder a n d the breaking
of promises seem self-
evident to us because our
society depends on
them. Other rules like
the laws against homo-
sexuality, prostitution
and drug taking only
define the nature of
society a n d can be flex-
ible. If w e accept the
non - universitality of
social laws, we can go a
long way towards ac-
cepting criminals, realis-
ing the non-existence of
a d i v i d i n g line between
' u s ' and ' t h e m ' a n d try-
ing to improve our penal
system.
In dealing with the
social origins of crime
we inevitably c o m e up
against the dirty w o r d
' c a p i t a l i s m ' . W e b l a m e
capitalism for its break-
ing up of the old secure
family unit by the move-
ment of labour w h i c h it
d e m a n d s a n d by the in-
adequate town planning (
w h i c h goes with it. W e
blame capitalism for the
consumer society w h i c h
it fosters, the greater
and greater consumption
w h i c h it demands for its
own livelihood, a n d the
strain it places on indivi-
duals to achieve this
spectacular level of con-
sumption. W e blame
capitalism for the 'white
collar' crimes of today.
Gangsters have turned
from the crude violent
methods of yesterday to
the sophisticated and
legal tax evasion games
of today.
The myth of the quick
way to riches and the in-
credible jackpot stories
make fools of wage
earners reminding them
constantly of their in-
adequacy and spurring
them onto action.
What is society's solu-
tion to the problem of
people who yield to its
pressures? It removes
them for a time to a
highly artificial situation
and then puts them back
again. Perhaps our pro-
perty and lives are pro-
tected for a w h i l e a n d
our indignation satisfied,
but the heart of the mat-
ter is never reached. It
is in prison that a young
child first realises his
identity as a juvenile de-
linquent.
. He is stamped for life
and goes forward with a
set of values formed in
prison.
There does not seem
to be any alternative to
this inhuman curtailing
of personal freedom in
the case of violent
prisoners. A l l w e can do
is to try to reduce long
periods of isolation. Dur-
ing imprisonment w e
can make sure that
prisoners are doing work
w h i c h is suited to their
abilities or that they
learn something w h i c h
will keep them out of
prison. Prisoners have
been found to be very
good at social work be-
cause they understand
the difficulties
A lot can be done to-
wards successfully re-
settling released pris-
oners. At the moment
prisoners are given three
pounds to start their
new life w i t h . Even if
they do not blow it all
on drink the moment
they are released they
can still not get a room
because landladies de-
mand at least a week's
pay in advance. W i t h no
fixed abode they cannot
get social securities and
jobs are very difficult to
get. It is not surprising
that many return to pris-
on.
In a lot of cases the
difficulty of resettling
can be evaded by not
sending offenders to
prison in the first place.
M a n y non-violent pris-
oners benefit greatly
from community-based
alternatives and from
victim-offender contact.
Already prisoners can be
given up to 2 4 0 hours of
community work instead
of confinement, but this
is usually in the form of
highly unsuitable manual
labour.
In Britain the ' R a d i c a l
Alternatives to P r i s o n '
(RAP) group is fighting
for research and publi-
city for radical alterna-
tives. They are a new

8,000 PACES LATER
Following the mad fias-
co of past weeks, the
cross - country club,
against their better judg-
ment, raced around
Richmond Park for the
second time this year, in
a match against the
police last Wednesday. 1
am sorry to say that we
narrowly lost by 82
points.
The race started at a
slow pace, except for one
Keith Ahlers who at 800
metres was leading the
field by a clear 50 yards.
The police soon turned
the tables and made off
with a number of the
better positions at the
finish 5 miles later.
A special mention must
go to A l f who not only
knocked 9 mins. 10
seconds off his personal
best but also 118 places
off last week's perfor-
mance. This lad was
closely followed by R o b
who rumbled in noisily in
9th position.
It was rumoured that
the dreaded bandaged
left knee would be run-
ning again but it (the
bandage) was unwashed,
so its appearance was
postponed. Cloaked i n a
grey trouser leg the knee
remained unmoved by
the o c c a s i o n . A l s o
noticed, by his absence
was G . Imp, his non-
appearance g r e a t l y
affected the team morale.
Let us hope he recovers
from, his injury i n time
for the handicap race.
This week's races i n -
clude a run at Wye
College and the Stag H i l l
relay, a report about
them in next week's edi-
tion.
