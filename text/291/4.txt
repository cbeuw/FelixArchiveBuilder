Saga
It was on the Wasserkuppe,
one of a range of hills in
Central Germany, that glid-
ing all began, and it was to
Poppenhausen - an - der -
Wasserkuppe that two
I.C.G.C. members went to
collect their new glider.
Driving a borrowed car and
towing a borrowed trailer,
29ft. long, we covered the
1,200 mile round trip in four
days and four hours.
After collecting all the
relevant pieces of paper and
our shiny new A S K 8B
glider from Herr Schleicher,
and being shown round his
rather splendid factory, we
departed for home. By even-
ing we reached the Germany/
him our form and said ' No,
we have a form which says
we need not pay duty.' He
said we must pay duty. £133.
We laughed. Back in the
main building once more we
searched for a friendly face,
and found a Belgian Cus-
tom official, and he took us
to see Le Grand Chef. Fif-
ten minutes later we learned
his decision. We must pay
duty. So we retreated to
Aachen Jugendherbergen
and slept on it.
The next morning we sat
in the car and counted our
pennies and dollars and
Deutsche Marks and Belgian
Francs and Traveller's
cheques. We had £130 and
nothing for petrol, so we
swore. The solution as it
turned out, was simple. We
merely drove out on another
road and they let us through.
Even before we finished
our breakfast work had be-
gun on rendering the A S K
The new ASK Glider 8B
Belgium border at Aachen.
We confidently showed all
our papers to the man, who
sent us inside the large Cus-
toms building. Here, another
man told us to go to Mon-
sieur Bonnie, out the back.
And there we ground to a
halt. He looked at our forms,
including the one which ex-
cused us import duty into
Belgium, and said ' You must
pay import duty.' We showed

8B airworthy. That this only
took us a fortnight is wholly
due to the work of M r . Ir-
ving, to whom we become
even more indebted. He
claimed partial reward in the
form of the first flight, on
8th March, and the aircraft
has been flown at all possible
times since. It has made sev-
eral flights of over an hour,
which is good so early in the
year, and has been taken to
6.300ft., a gain of 4,500ft.
The aircraft is designed as
a local soaring machine, suit-
able for early solo pilots. It
has a low minimum sinking
speed and can be flown very
slowly. This, combined with
its excellent handling quali-
ties, means that it can stay
up in the most inexpert hands
and the weakest of thermals.
The greatest advantage,
however, is that it has re-
leased our Skylark 4 for the
more experienced pilots, and
already the Skylark has done
over 300 kms. cross-country
this year, and been to 7,300
ft. in cloud. It has earned
one Silver C distance, to
Shoreham near Brighton. We
fully expect the trend to con-
tinue this summer.

Yacht

saurus
(gigantic Mesozoic fossil
marine reptile equipped with
four paddles and a tail —
Chambers Dictionary).
Last year in July, I.C. Sail-
ing Club took delivery of a
' Folkdancer' class cruiser.
She is 27ft. long and 5 tons
( T h a m e s measurement).
Made of fibreglass this 5-
berth Bermudan rigged sloop
is based on the popular Folk-
boat which is sailed all over
the world. Icky (pet name)
soon proved to be a fast boat,
capable of 7 knots off the
wind and remaining well bal-
anced under any arrange-
ment of sails. She can be
handled by two crew on deck
in all-weather conditions.
Spring (?) Cleaning
Late in February, Sandy,
Pete and Henry took the
sails and navigational equip-
ment to the boat and sailed
her to the Folly Inn slipway
to be scrubbed. While we
waited for the double high
tide to go out and leave
Icky standing high and dry
we fortified ourselves with
Persian curry and Guinnes-
ses. 10.30! Armed with
torches, brooms and buckets
we removed a centimetre of
grey slime and four barn-
acles from the Icky bottom.
At 2.30 a.m. with the rising
tide lapping round our
ankles we climbed aboard
and slept till 5.00 a.m. by
when the whole boat was
covered in snow and hoar
frost and the river in (thin)
pack-ice. So . . . we decided
to go for a sail round the
Solent. Near Fawley we
sighted another boat: ' What
on earth are you doing out
Karen Gott and Geoff Cooper tripping the light fantastic
at this time of year?' hailed
we, ' We're mad, what about
you? ' ' We're just students;
have a Guinness! ' and we
passed two bottles across.
The snow had all suddenly
slid off into someone's oil-
skins so we sailed home and
moored Icky opposite the
Folly Inn in readiness for the
next weekend and Easter
cruises.
Easter Cruises
England
Messrs. Cripps, Maddison,
Stevens, Francis and Rhodes
arrived in Cowes the day
after the I.C.W.A. formal.
Needless to say they did not
set off until the next day.
The aim was Cherbourg,
Jersey and back; things
worked out differently.
On that warm and wind-
less Sunday Icky just made
Christchurch and almost
spent the night firmly
aground on various parts of
the harbour as the engine
kept cutting out.
Monday, too, dawned
sunny and warm with wind
gusting force zero. Attempt
no. 2 to reach Cherbourg
ended by motoring back to
Lymington, and an evening
kidding the local landlady
that we had just arrived from
the Mediterranean.
Tuesday: Rain. Pancakes
cooked till opening time.
The Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday were superb, and
Icky visited Beaulieu, the
Hamble and every part of
Chichester harbour. A dif-
ferent port and a different
pub every night.
France
Easter Saturday, high tide
at Emsworth we boarded
Icky bound for France. We
motored and sailed against
wind and tide to Ryde I.O.W.
where Sandy Eames anchored
Icky on a convenient sand-
bank. The tide turned at
02.30 so Jacqui Buzzard and
Him up anchored. In thick
fog off Yarmouth, Skipper
Peter Banbury and Plod
(from Hull) took over as the
last of the tide took us to the
Needles.
Dawn and good weather
forecast decided us for the
crossing. Cap de la Hoque
appeared exactly where pre-
dicted and the rising wind
gave a tremendous sail to
Cherbourg just 11 hours
from England.
We were gale bound until
Thursday while Cherbourg
filled up with English Army
yachts, a crowd from Shriv-
enham challenged us to a
' round the island' race in
May. Icky was the smallest
yacht to have crossed over
so we were anxious about the
return trip but we sailed be-
tween gales leaving two days
to recover and prepare Icky
for the next crew.

Intervarsity
Dancing
At the Annual Intervarsity
Ball and Dancing competition
held in Bristol, the I.C. Danc-
ing club retained the U.L.U.
Challenge Cup for London
Clubs entering the Varsity
competition, coming second
to Manchester in this year's
competition.
The teams consist of four
couples, dancing one of the
Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep
Cha-Cha-Cha. The individual
competition was the Jive, in
which I.C. entered three cou-
ples.
Several members of the
team distinguished them-
selves. Geoff Cooper and
Karen Gott came second in
the Waltz. Derek and Jane
Southgate came third in the
Foxtrot and Ron Foster and
Veronica Churchwood fifth
in the Quickstep.
Apart from such esoteric
delights as demolishing the
Intervarsity Competition, the
Dancing Club meets at least
once a week throughout the
session. There are two begin-
ners classes and an interme-
diate class in the Autumn
term, one beginners, an inter-
mediate and an advanced
class in the Spring term,
whilst in summer the classes
tend to lead up to one of the
many dancing competitions.
