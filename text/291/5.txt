N.U:S:
Conference
Delegates from the small
colleges went home from the
N.U.S. Conference feeling
much heartened by their im-
pact on the conference.
The plight of the smaller
colleges was much adver-
tised. John Docherty, a
Welsh delegate, called for
the small colleges to show
their strength and refused to
leave the floor until he was
assured by the exec, that
some way for the small col-
leges to express their views
could be found. He was given
a standing ovation by large
sections of his audience.
The problems of small col-
leges were highlighted by
speeches pointing out that
most of their unions opera-
ted on an income of less than
£1 per head (compared with
I.C.U.'s grant of £6 per
head).
The revolt was partially
resolved when it was decided
at a small colleges meeting
that the best way to make
sure that their views were
heard in N.U.S. was to col-
laborate with Universities
and neighbouring institutions
in their home areas. I.C. is a
pioneer of this sort of system
with the ' University of South
Kensington.' Evert more con-
tacts were made with South
West London colleges during
the conference.
Grants — Exec, defeated
The most important de-
bates were those on discip-
line, representations, South
Africa and, of course, the
binary system of education.
The debate on grants high-
lighted a change in N.U.S.
policy. Previous motions on
grants have been long and
complicated. The N.U.S.
exec, motion was defeated
and one highlighting the
worst aspects of grants (the
abolition of discretionary
awards) was passed. These
awards are awarded by local
education authorities for
non-university courses. In
some H.E.A.'s there is a
definite policy of restricting
art college and mature stu-
dents' grants. N.U.S. must
now fight harder to stop this
prejudice.
Elections — Piers fails
Piers Corbyn failed to get
elected to the N.U.S. execu-
tive. He was supported in the
election by many of the
smaller colleges but the large
block votes of the larger Uni-
versities went for each others
candidates. The London vote
was also split.
There was a small swing
to the left. The national
press highlighted the elec-
tion of the Communist Digby
Jacks as Secretary. He is in
fact not a member of the
' New Left' but an old style
communist. The other elec-
Travel
In 1970 there have been
several new developments in
the field of eligibility for
student transport.
Students wishing to use
travel facilities must be in
possession of the Internation-
al Student Identity Card be-
fore booking. This is a new
card introduced at the be-
ginning of the year by the
International Student Travel
Conference to give interna-
tionally accepted proof of
the bona fide student status
of students travelling abroad.
The blue NUS card, although
to add to the confusion it
still bears the title of Inter-
national Student Identity
Card, is only a membership
card of the National Union
of Students in this country
and it is no longer valid for
booking international student
travel facilities. Members of
tions produced a fair cross-
section of student political
opinion.
The change in N.U.S. was
reflected in the debate on
South Africa. For the first
time almost a whole day was
spent discussing a political
motion. The views of most
students at the conference
were reflected by one of the
Keele delegation: ' Liberal-
ism in South Africa is dead
—the only solution is the vio-
lent overthrow of the regime.'
the N U S receive the TSIC
free of charge and all other
bona fide full time students
can obtain one for 6/-. These
cards are available from
NUS headquarters of Local
Student Travel Bureaux.
The rules for eligibility on
student charter flights are
more restrictive than they
have been in the past. There
is now an upper age limit of
30 years for all full time stu-
dents. Past students are no
longer eligible for flights ex-
cept that they may use them
up to 31st December of the
year in which they complete
their studies. These restric-
tions on eligibility are not
laid down by NUS but by the
European Civil Aviation
Conference. Great Britain is
a member of E C A C and it
is on the basis of NUSTS ad-
hering to the conditions laid
down by E C A C that the A i r
Transport Licensing Board
grants the licences which are
necessary to operate the
flights.
Flights
In the summer of 1970
NUS Travel Service will be
operating somewhere in the
region of 1,500 flights to and
from 44 destinations as op-
posed to 25 in 1969. New
routes include London to:
New York (£61 or £65 re-
turn), Bilbao (£10 10s.
single), Bombay (£62 10s.
single), Budapest (£15 single),
Corfu (£19 single), Han-
over (£9 5s. single), Japan
(£187 10s. return), Oporto
(£13 single), Pisa (£12 single),
Stuttgart (£9 5s. single), Tan-
giers (£18 single), and Rome
to Malta (£10 single) and
Tunis (£8 7s. single). This
year the majority of flights
chartered by N U S Travel
Service will be operated by
BEA's new charter company,
B E A Airtours. Flights oper-
ated by other members of
the Student A i r Travel As-
sociation (SATA) can also
be booked through the N U S
Travel Service and during
the summer of 1970 their
members are operating a net-
work of 260 routes.
Trains
Eligibility for traingroup
travel is much wider than for
flights. In the summer of
1970 there will be 25 NUSTS
traingroup destinations. The
5 new routes are:
Belgrade — an additional
destination in Yugoslavia and
a convenient point for pas-
sengers visiting Rumania
and Bulgaria.
Berlin — of great interest
in its own right and also very
convenient for students en
route to Poland.
Rimini — centre of the
Adriatic beaches holiday
area.
Seville — a rail destination
in Southern Spain with the
chance to see something of
Paris and Madrid en route
(approx. 4 hours free in
each).
Stockholm — the cheapest
way to visit Sweden a coun-
try of particular interest to
students of economics, soci-
ology and design.
Special Note for hitch-
hikers: There is now a daily
train service from London to
any station in Belgium for
£2 18s. single.
Shipping
For students who don't
wish to travel with large
groups of other students there
are still facilities available to
cross the sea at a reduced
price — B & I ferries to Ire-
land, Hovercraft to France,
BR/Zeeland to Hook of Hol-
land and Prinz Ferries to
Germany as well as facilities
within the Mediterranean.
Holidays
For students who have
only a few weeks to spare
and who want their accom-
modation arranged for them,
NUS Travel Service has ar-
ranged a wide variety of holi-
days and tours in 21 different
countries. Some examples of
these are a 25 day tour of
India (£275 fully inclusive),
15 days in Canet de Mar on
the Costa Brava (£37 10s.),
a two centre holiday Rome
and lschia (£54 10s.), 13 day
tour of Western Hungary
(£58 by scheduled flight).
These holidays are, of course,
much more student orienta-
ted than the normal package
tours, and there is an added
incentive to male students—
the groups nearly always
have more girls than boys !
