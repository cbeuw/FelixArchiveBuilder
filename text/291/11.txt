Editorial
The last issue of Felix presents us with the last opportunity to examine the achieve-
ments of the sporting clubs this year. There are about 20 athletic clubs at I.C. and, as can
usually be expected, most have achieved a good degree of success in the University of
London Competitions and some in even wider fields of sport.
The results of some of the more successful clubs are listed below :
ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL CLUB
1st XI: U.L. Premier League Champions.
2nd XI: U.L. Division I.R. Champions.
Winners of reserve team cup.

have, however, already won the U.L. Relays Cup and come second in the U.L. Cham-
pionships.
BADMINTON CLUB
The club first team have a very impressive playing record in the U.L. Division I
whining all ten of their matches to become cthampions. The third team lost only two
{matches to become Division IV champions.
Individual members brought the club great prestige by winning the British Univer-
sities Badminton Titles in the Men's Double s and Women's Singles events.

Boat Club:
I.C. Powers On
I.C. Boat Club started the
season well with an early
win at Putney Amateur Re-
gatta, on the first Saturday
of term. The win was scored
in the premier fours event
— Junior section Ooxless
class — beating the U . L .
Wyfold four by half a
length in the second round.
Dealing effectively with the
rough water they found no
difficulty in winning the
other three rounds, in spite
of the high standard.
The list VIII made its
debut a week later at Ham-
Hockey: Successful Easter Tour in Holland
During the Easter vaca-
tion, twelve members of the
hockey club visited North
Holland. We were enter-
tained by students from the
University of Groningen
and this has now been es-
tablished as a regular ex-
change visit. The tour was
very successful, and al-
though the arrangement of
our matches by the Dutch
left a Kittle to be desired,
some very enjoyable games
were played and some good
results achieved.
Results:
v. Gronlingen lst X I D 1—1
v. Groningen 2nd X I W 4—2
v. Amsterdam University
W 3—1
Our best performance of
the tour was probably the
opening game. We arrived

in Groningen in the morn-
ing and found that we were
expected to play that same
afternoon. Having had no
sleep at all the previous
night during the crossing we
were expecting the worst
against Groningen lst X I ,
who incidentally regularly
run nine elevens. However,
I.C, took the lead midway
through the first half and
held on until a momentary
lapse in defence gave Gron-
ingen the equaliser.
Two games the next day
provided us with a couple
of victories. I.C. were al-
ways in command against
Groningen 2nd and with a
splendid hat-trick from Pete
Bates ran out comfortable
4—-2 winners. In a slightly
disorganised game against
the University of Amster-
dam, we deservedly won
3—1.
For the rest of the tour
we played mixed hockey.
We travelled to the Hague
on Good Friday and joined
farces with Groningen in an
extremely friendly and en-
joyable if not strenuous
tournament.
The touring party was
without five regular mem-
bers of the defence and be-
cause of this a 4-2-3-1-1
system was employed. This
worked extremely well and
I.C. combined really well,
;playing some splendid
hockey. Everyone played
exceptionally well and it is
perhaps unfair to single out
individuals.. However, men-
tion must be made of Julian
Sargent and Robin King who
played solidly in defence
and the forward line as a
whole which created some
excellent openings which
merstnith and lost the final
of Junior Seniors by three
feet to Auriol. They had to
fighit round the outside of
the bend on the notorious
Middlesex Station, which
also claimed another victim
in Tim Bennett making a
welcome appearance for I.C.
in Junior sculls. The eight
grabbed consolation in beat-
ing their deadly rival
Thames Rowing Club, and
received a good write-up in
the Daily Telegraph, where
the correspondent judges
their standard "at least as
high" as the senior eights.
The crew improves on every
outing and the silverware
prospects are good.
The Illrd VIII went to
France during the Easter
Vacation and came second
in the Petit Finale of the
French Colleges Regatta, re-
ceiving excellent hospitality
from the French crews.
Three Novice eights are
blasting their way into the
summer and must surely
bring home some prizes.

were neatly finished off by
Pete Bates.
Socially too, the tour was
quite a success. We had
some very enjoyable even-
ings in the Groningen
Union, playing Roulette
and drinking in the "English
Pub" which they arranged
'specially for us with free
tickets for an Ice-Hockey
match between two Canad-
ian sides. Next year it is our
turn to entertain Groningen
and it is hoped that we will
all have an equally enjoy-
able time.

Cricket
Cricket seems to have got
off to a reasonable Start mis
season. Managing to field
/about three XIs we have
met with something like
50% success.
The lst X I had difficulty
in beating a rather weak
Northern Polytechnic side in
the first round of the U L U
Knockout Cup. For this we
were indebted mainly to
Chandra Shah — who took
2—38 — and perhaps also
to Russ Smith who scored
42. The scores were 112 to
90. We also won the second
match against Merton by
about twenty runs for which
Paul Martin deserves some
credit.
The 2nd X I haven't done
quite so well. They man-
aged to beat Regency thanks
to Mike Barton (38) and
Pete Bunby (5—8), but were
well beaten by London
Transport, This was by 9
wickets. The 3rd have only
had the one game so far
against St. Paul's. This also
ended in defeat by quite a
wide margin.
In spite of these uninspir-
ing results we shall probably
be more successful later on
in the season, since there
seems to be more interest
this year than in recent years
and most players are still a
little out of practice. Having
got through the first round
of the cup (always difficult)
we must Stand a good
chance of winning lit this
year. Here's hoping anyway.
