Epilogue
If you are like some Detective story readers and have read
the first few chapters and then turned to the end of the
book, it should perhaps be emphasised that A S L U F is for
reference rather than escapist bedtime reading. It is to be
hoped that it is informative and that members of the College
will contribute to further additions by sending, or bringing,
ideas and opinions to the Associated Studies office.
Torture in the
twentieth Century
— A philosophical discussion by X
on the evolution of punitive
The time allotted draws
close for thousands of stu-
dents of all ages to face the
most evil invention yet de-
vised by man, the examina-
tion — the final distillate of
the days of Chivalry and the
Spanish Inquisition.
Facade
Cunningly connived to
sort out the new champions
of our age and to crush
without mercy those who fall
beside the way, this new
terror ignores all bounds set
by previous tortures; it'pur-
sues its nefarious path re-
gardless of age or sex of the
victim, and kicks behind the
admirable facade of know-
ledge.
The Web
The exam is more subtle
than its predecessors in the
technique
extraction of knowledge, it
demands that its victim vol-
untarily ensnare itself in the
web, that the inquisitor work
harder than the victim. Once
in the web there is no escape,
those found lacking are dis-
carded and the winners put
through again and again
until they too are thrown
aside. The ecstacy of final
success never comes, there
is always another dread exam
waiting near at hand to
snatch the luckless victim.
The names of Ghengis Khan,
Napoleon, Peter the Great
never struck as much fear
into the hearts of men as the
end of term exam. The ideals
of de Sade have been rea-
lised in a way that would
make Caesar Borgia wince.
The propagation of

The brain in question belongs to Messels,
one of the largest and longest established
firms of stockbrokers. It is an advanced
computer system which in the next few
years will be developed and expanded to
become central to the firm's management.
Work on achieving both integrated admini-
stration and research facilities in one data
processing system is intellectually stimu-
lating - and rewarding in every sense.
Messel's D.P. department has attracted
highly skilled and experienced
computer people as well as last year's
intake of lively young university
graduates.
This year, Messels can offer
more graduates from any
disciplines (and of either
sex) the opportunity to
train for
progressive posts'in programming, systems
analysis, technical support, and other
specialities. Young computer people with
Messels are educated throughout their
careers and promoted on merit. Those who
develop an interest in stockbroking are
helped to branch out in that direction.
Salaries start from £1,100 to £1,500 p.a.,
depending on capabilities. A profit-sharing
scheme in operation may well raise these
figures by a substantial amount. The suc-
cessful graduate should double his or her
basic salary in three to four years.
To be considered by Messels you should
have a logical brain, the ability to mix well
with people, and the will to tackle mind-
stretching projects. If you think you match
up, write concisely about your background,
education, activities and interests to:
