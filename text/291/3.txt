Piers Corbyn takes a drastically edited look at the
achievements of this year

G o l c u t t . . .
Does it strike you as
strange that the college auth-
orities are so worried by the
establishment o f t h e
I.C.R.C.? Professor Ball hur-
riedly writes on behalf of
the clerical workers declining
to take part in the I.C.R.C.
(If you're even in Met-
talurgy you'll recognise
the venerable professor —
he's the corpulent gentleman
in miniskirt sitting on a
typewriter key, or perhaps
hiding in a file — just an or-
dinary clerk). Fortunately the
real clerical staff are being
asked their opinion. Similarly
the A.U.T. committee, with-
out discussion among our
mandate from the academic
staff, but after strong hints
from the Rector of dire con-
sequences, shied off joining
I.C.R.C. at present, despite
their initial interest.
On issues other than the
Representative Council nego-
tiations between college ad-
min, and the various sections
of I.C. have gone well recent-
ly — A.S.T.M.S. got its 21%
payrise, I.C.U. its 5 Repre-
sentatives on B.O.S.T. In
this context the Rector's in-
transigence over the I.C.R.C.
appears misplaced The
admin, are yielding to sec-
tional demands (often only
after pressure and the par-
ticular section proved its
strength — that's tactics) but
remaining unyielding on
joint proposals. As long as
the various groups (I.C.U.,
A.U.T., A.S.T.M.S., etc.) can
be kept separated and
quiet (!) by the college giv-
ing in on pay deals and rep-
resentation (meaningless only
of course) then I.C. Ltd. can
be maintained as a graduates
plus research factory for
government and industry.
The policy is divide and
rule, so much is obvious, but
the means to overcome this
resistance to a ' comprehen-
sive critical co-adult partici-
patory academic community'
(courtesy Chairman P.C.) is
not so clear.
It is all tied up with the
Rector's insistence on the
present channels of commu-
nication (and the support
given him by Heads of De-
partments). After all just
who do they represent? Their
position of power is brought
into question by the idea of
a community. The logic be-
hind the Rector saying that
dictatorship is better than
democracy at I.C. is deep
rooted. After all you cannot
have members of a depart-
ment deciding its policy; they
might dislike the carefully
hidden defence contracts or
the mysterious private firms
run in college time, with col-
lege equipment, using college
personnel to make monies
for select individuals.
Our god of B.o.G. (Lord
Sherfield) stated that trade
and finance was above poli-
tics; although the actions of
his fellow industrialists,
fighting so hard for a con-
servative government and
suppression of the trade un-
ions, would appear 'strange-
ly ' at odds with this state-
ment. In a similar vein some
I.C. students protest that
there is too much external
politics in Union meetings,
as though politics could be
' external,' politics is the
link, the perspective. Most
decisions of the Union are
politically based. Diversifi-
cation involves taking a
stand on the role of I.C. and
science in society, not just ar-
ranging courses.
Anyway people, the year
of the great leap ends — and
the question of whether sate-
lites will ever sing the
thoughts of Rector Piers re-
mains unasked.
A tremendous amount has
been achieved this year and a
tremendous number of events
have occurred. The Autumn
Term — " the term of the
abstract nouns " — was initi-
ally dominated by policy for-
mulation/formalization and
the setting of a direction for
the Union. Later students be-
came more involved in events
as the events related to or
arising from the policies took
place. The Autumn term be-
gan the lodgings crisis — a
' sleep i n ' — on the first day
of term, our initiative on this
made the national press.
Over the summer we had
been granted observer status
on the Governing Body and
rejected by the Board of
Studies (BoSt), so on October
16 we increased our demands
and pressed again for rep-
resentation on the BoSt and

established the ICRC. 'The
Senate House Beating' of
Richard Saville brought the
Africa into the open. Form-
issues of Rhodesia and South
alization of Union policy on
Diversification set an impor-
tant signpost. The (Nov. 13)
decision to join N U S was a
great landmark in the politi-
cal development of I.C. The
(Nov. 17) distribution of
BoSt secret minutes shocked
a great many students and
staff into the realisation that
' all is not lovely up there'
and convinced people of the
necessity of a stronger ap-
proach. So, on November 27
the Queen's Visit was used
to produce a pamphlet which
was very widely publicised
in the national press. A l l this
activity polarized student op-
inions and not unexpectedly
caused some ' backlash'
against me, which was for-
tunately squashed by a M o -
tion of Confidence at the
last 8th U G M of the term
(Dec. 9).
The Spring Term — ' the
term of action' — saw some
really incredible (for IC) de-
velopments in attitude and
consciousness (bumph + Un-
ion meetings did their trick!)
Over Christmas a Sabbatical
year for the President was
successfully negotiated — a
very important step to estab-
lish a strong Union. So was
NUS finance and a higher
salary for the Union Clerk
(who typed all bumph). The
decision to allow USK to use
the swimming pool was a vic-
tory after a long battle
against College bureaucrats
and backward attitudes re-
maining among some stu-
dents. (NB. I.C.U. would
probably have opposed such
usage 2 years ago). The 4
main issues of the term were
Architectural Association,
Refectories, Board of Stud-
ies Representation and
ICRC. Right from the start
of the term it was known that
' all was not well with the
A A negotiations.' The Un-
ion had obtained representa-
tion on some of the A A / I C
discussions after the ' black-
mail — embarrassment'
politics of pamphleting when
the Queen visited on Nov.
27. People were in a state of
crystal gazing over the A A
and BoSt and were jogged
into life by an historic — and
doubly successful — refec-
tory boycott on January 20,
which hit the national press
(and soon the idea spread to
other London Colleges). On
Jan. 22 direct action was
taken for the second time in
a week when an A A / I C
special committee meeting
was peacefully disrupted by
1.C. students. On February
2, I.C. Governing Body uni-
laterally terminated A A / I C
negotiations over student
representation and on Feb.
10 ICU organized the historic
' Moratorium' which was
well covered in the National
and local press and gave
NUS a strong hand in nego-
tiations with DES.
As a result of good policies
and groundwork since the
Autumn term, I C U played
an important and essential
part in the London Region
Housing Conference; and
also in the presentation of
statements of Quinquennial
development policy to the
U G C and of Higher Educa-
tion policy to the DES.
On Feb. 19 the tedious
BoSt will they/won't they?
' decision to decide' resulted
in a serious discussion for a
sit-in. That Union meeting
incidentally, although decid-
ing on very little, marked a
watershed for I C U in that
there was clear, well-ex-
pressed, constructive and
long discussions on some-
thing.
A n awareness campaign
then manifested itself. On
Mar. 5 there was a Utile dis-
cussion about files and more
discussion of unrest (especi-
ally about non-recognition
of the ICRC) and the Rector
came before the Union for
questioning and criticism for
1^ hours. The term was roun-
ded off with an exciting elec-
tion campaign in which the
' middle ' candidate for the
presidency was squeezed out;
this was very significant be-
cause a small centre group-
ing is indicative of (com-
paratively) intense political
struggle and discussion going
on within the general student
body.
The Summer term —prob-
ably ' the term of consolida-
tion and planning' is seeing
some more achievements.
The main issues at the be-
ginning were: B.O.S.T. rep-
resentation, Deans and
Heads of Dept. representa-
tion, I.C.R.C., Cleaners
speedup, and an important
outside issue — victimisation
at Liverpool, etc. On Wed-
nesday, 22 April, 6 Union
representatives were ' inter-
rogated ' by the B.O.S.T. for
11 hours. The B.O.S.T. ac-
ceded to the Union proposi-
tion and gave more than was
asked for (a verbal one was
put for more). This was an
important victory for embar-
rassment-persuasion politics.
On May Day some I.C. stu-
dents ' took power over their
environment' and painted a
zebra crossing in Exhibition
Road. The Sec-Elect of
N.U.S. addressed a small
rally at Queen's Tower
(about Liverpool victimisa-
tions, etc.) and I.C. students
subsequently distributed
1,500 leaflets to the public in
S. Ken.
The rest of the term will
be followed by a long vac
all set for more next year. •
