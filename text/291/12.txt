Professor David Cox, Head
of the Statistics Department,
will take over as head of
the Mathematics department
in October. He succeeds
Prof. Harry Jones, who will
be taking up the post of Pro-
Rector.
Professor Cox joined I.C.
in the Chair of Statistics in
1966 in succession to Prof.
Barnard. Prof. Cox studied
maths, at St. Johns Cam-,
bridge, and graduated with
first class honours in 1944.
He spent the following two
years as Junior Scientific
officer at the Royal Aircraft
Establishment, Farnborough,
and then joined the staff of
W I R A (Wool Industries Re-
search Association^ in Leeds.
In 1949 he was awarded
a Ph.D. by Leeds University,
and in 1950 he became assis-
tant Lecturer in mathematics
at the Statistics Lab.. Cam-
bridge. Prof. Cox left Cam-
bridge in 1955 and spent a
year in the U.S.A. as visiting
Professor and research asso-
ciate at the Universities of
Princeton, North Carolina
and California. He returned
to England in 1956 on his
appointment to a readership
in statistics at Birkbeck and
in 1961 was appointed to the
Chair there.
Prof. Cox spent the latter
half of 1965 at the Maths,
and Stats. Research Centre,
Bell Telephone Laboratory,
in New Jersey. Since coming
to I.C., he has become Edi-
tor of the statistical journal,
Biometrika, and recently be-
came Vice-President of the
Royal Statistical Society.

A tragic and bizarre sui-
cide occurred last Friday
afternoon when a Physics 2
student jumped from the top
floor of Southside and was
killed instantly.
This is believed to bring
to 3 the number of suicides
at the College recently.
However, an I C Union
survey last year showed that
the suicide rate at IC is
lower than at most
other Colleges/Universities,
though the rate of mental
breakdowns is high.

Staff-Student
Consultation
The I.C. Association of University Teachers (the A.U.T.)
recently put forward some refreshing proposals for improv-
ing the effectiveness of Staff-Student consultation. With the
recent disbanding of JURGO, these proposals have become
even more relevant.
Over the past few years
considerable efforts have
been made by staff and stu-
dents to bring into being
machinery for ensuring that
the students of the College
can express their views effec-
tively on the present and
future academic activities of
the College. As a result there
exist:
Departmental staff-student
committees (in most depart-
ments).
Student Union Academic
Sub-Committee (City and
Guilds).
Student representatives on
certain College committees.
Nevertheless there exists
an explicit unsatisfied de-
mand amongst students for
further machinery.
The A.U.T. pointed out
that it may perhaps be argu-
ed by some that this explicit
demand is voiced only by a
minority of students. Whe-
ther or not this is so, it is
possible that a majority of

students would express some
kind of dissatisfaction with
their courses if they had ade-
quate opportunity to do so.
Departmental-level staff-
student committees exist in
most departments. However,
in the view of the I C A U T
Committee a further level of
contact is required, namely
that of the students of a par-
ticular department and in a
particular year; i.e. "year
level".
First Reaction
The first reaction of many
people to such a proposal
must certainly be "Not an-
other batch of commitees,
please!" A n d of course it is
impossible to prove that
sucb committees are either
necessary or desirable. It is
a matter of judgement.
Never the less in the view
of the I C A U T Committee,
"year-level" committees are,
except perhaps in very small
departments, the most pro-
mising way both of increas-
ing the effectiveness of the
existing structure and of
satisfying better the legiti-
mate demand of the student
body for more effective con-
sultation. The arguments that
the I C A U T Committee find
most persuasive are as fol-
lows :
(1) Most students in a par-
ticular department and
year are primarily con-
cerned with the prob-
lems of their departmen-
tal year group and
barely register the exis-
tence of departmental
staff-student committees.
(2) The number of staff
specifically involved in
improving staff-student
consultation is too small.
(3) The departmental staff-
student committees have
to cover a very wide
field of activity, viz. all
undergraduate (and per-
haps postgraduate) mat-
ters. They may in most
cases be successful in re-
solving the matters that
are referred to them
(although this is not
certain), but they could
not undertake to initiate
active staff-student con-
sultation in each year
group since they would
be overwhelmed if they
were successful. They
are obliged instead to
adopt a passive policy
of dealing with problems
that are referred to
them.
(4) If "year level" commit-
tees existed they could
actively encourage staff-
student consultation at
the level that interests
the majority of students.
Operation
For clarifying the proposal
it is desirable to describe the
way in which a year-level
committee might operate;
but the following detailed
suggestions are not to be
taken as firm rules for all
departments.
A t y p i c a l committee
would consist of 3 elected
students from the particular
departmental year group and
3 staff nominated by the
students from the staff who
teach their year.
The commitee would:
(1) Call together the year
group at least once a
term and discuss with
them what matters
should be referred to the
committee.
(2) Take what action it
could to clear up the
matters referred to it by
the whole group; refer
to the departmental staff
student committees, any
matter where action was
required but where it
was not competent to
act; report back to the
whole group once a
term.
(3) Draw up a question-
naire for the student
group on matters affect-
ing the group and the
staff who teach the
group.
The occasional meetings
of the year group should be
arranged within College
hours in order to ensure both
that sufficient importance is
attached to them and that
sufficient time is available.
Conclusion
The I C A U T Committee
put the present proposal for-
ward for discussion by all
who are concerned to im-
prove the effectiveness of
staff-student consultation.
The proposal is for the crea-
tion of staff-student commit-
tees at departmental year-
level. These committees will
be complementary to the
existing departmental staff-
student commitees, which,
although capable of im-
rovement, will remain im-
portant. The I C A U T Com-
mittee are hopeful that im-
plementation of the proposal
will result in more effective
consultation between staff
and students at the "grass
roots" or "shop floor" level
where much of the real busi-
ness of the College takes
place; and that any improve-
ment at this level, will have
important and beneficial
repercussions at all other
levels.
