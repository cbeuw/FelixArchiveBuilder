I.C. beat Anderlecht-
hold Brussels to a draw
by Mike Adams I.C. 14, Brussels Univ. 14
I.C. 6, Anderlect 5
A t 11 a.m. on Saturday
21st March, 17 quiet, well-
ordered members of the
R.F.C. left Victoria bound
for Brussels—little did they
know they were to return
broken men, mere hulks of
the athletes they once were!
There was some doubt as
to whether the grim-faced
customs officers at Ostend
would let us enter the
country—-this was mainly
due to the singing of various
airs to herald our glorious
arrival in poor (oh! so
poor) Belgium. After a
rather u n e v e n t f u l train
journey (there was no bar
unlike the B.R. ferry) we
reached Brussels, found our
hotel and settled down for
the night—or so the man-
agement thought!
It may be quite truthfully
recorded that a certain level
of alcohol content was
reached in the ' players'
bloodstreams that night,
below which it did not sink
for the following five days—
however, a relatively quiet
evening, we merely found
our way around that evil, oh
so evil, city.
Brussels University
The following Sunday
afternoon we managed to
turn out against a strong
Brussels University side—the
game was played on a rock
hard pitch and in sweltering
sunshine. These, more than
the opposing 15 Belgians, did
more to hold us to a 14-all
draw although the side
played some attractive rugby
after gaining their second
wind (or was it after losing a
great deal of beer through
sweat and various other
r a t h e r m o r e f o r c e d
methods ?) The University
proved to be admirable hosts
and by the time we arrived
back to the city centre all
thoughts of nursing bruised
bones were speedily for-
gotten in a night of unfor-
gettable action (some people
Still bear the scars!)
The next day was to have
been a free one in which the
city's many famous build-
ings and streets should have
been admired, however the
visit to Wielman's brewery
rather hindered this tourist
activity. Suffice it to say
that whereas various people
who set out with the in-
tention of an early bedtime
found themselves again eat-
ing breakfast, bright and
early at 8 a.m.!
Anderlecht
The second game was
played against the National
Champions — Anderlecht
R.F.C. This was played
under floodlights on the
Tuesday evening on, again a
g r a s s l e s s pitch — further
hindered by teeming rain.
However this proved a
marvellous game, the college
finally winning by 6pts. to
5pts. The standard of rugby
was exceptionally high and
I hereby verify the party
' redeemed' themselves in
the face of Union 'tax-
payers '. Anderlecht proved
to be even more riotous hosts
and I must really apologise
for the team's performance
back at Brussels that night
—everyone was in bed,
sound asleep by 4 p.m.!
A long and weary journey
back to London was suffered
the next day and thanks to
the elements for a calm
crossing or we'd have lost a
few on the way, I'm sure. A
tour to rank with the
greatest, both on and off the
field and I hope future tours
to Belgium fare so well—
even if it does take them the
rest of the vac. to recover.
Over the Easter Vacation both I.C.
Rugby and Football clubs went on
tour abroad . . . and neither lost
a single match.

Not to be outdone by the
English professional league
clubs playing Europe, April
4th saw a party of I.C. foot-
ballers assembling at Vic-
toria station eager to take on
the cream of German foot-
ball. The journey to Karls-
ruhe in the heart of the
Rhineland was, on the
whole, without incident,
though the crossing was so
calm that certain members
of the party endeavoured to
simulate seasickness by
making use of duty-free
liquor to be found on the
boat.
The party arrived in
Karlsruhe to find a blizzard
raging. However, our affable
German host, Axel Goer-
rinjer, efficient as only the
Germans can be quickly
arranged a sightseeing tour
on foot and a visit to the
swimming pool. In case this
wasn't sufficient to give
everyone pneumonia the
afternoon was spent watch-
ing a local league amateur
game on a cold windswept
ground.
After spending the first
night in a hotel in Karlsruhe
the party moved the next
day to stay at a sportschool
in Durlack a few miles out-
side the city. The sport-
school was situated at the
top of a steep mountain and
was arrived at by climbing
about 500 steps. It seemed,
at first glance, that it would
By John Darley
be completely unassailable
in an inebriated condition.
First Match
The first match of the
tour was played against a
village team Spock which
played in the 2nd amateur
division. The pitch had
obviously b e e n l i g h t l y
gravelled for the game Which
was played in the evening
under what were described
as floodlights. This was
apparently a German joke
which was lost on the
English players who could
only see six 40 watt bulbs
hanging on telegraph poles.
The only time the I.C. goal-
keeper could see the ball
was when it was lying in the
back of the net and, not
surprisingly I.C. were 5—2
down at half-time. In the
second half I.C. played with
great determination and en-
thusiasm and were able to
score 3 very good goals after
20 minutes. Although both
sides tried hard after this
there was no further score
and a draw was probably a
fair result.
After the game I.C. were
entertained to a lavish sup-
per consisting of many
varieties of German sausage.
Most of these were very
obviously unpalatable to the
English stomach judging
from the scenes of the sport-
school later in the evening—
though this condition could
possibly have been brought
on by a mixture of beer,
schnapps and wine.
The next day the party
visited a perfume factory in
the morning, a rather
arduous task considering the
state of most people's
stomachs, and in the after-
noon played a series of 5-a-
side games against local
teachers. The I.C. first squad
lost 2—1 but were avenged
by the second team who won
9—5.
The second full game of
the tour was played on the
Thursday evening on a much
better pitch and under very
good lights. A very even
game saw I.C. 2—1 up with
about 5 minutes to go but
Wiesloch equalised with a
long shot to give I.C. their
second draw of the tour.
The last full day of the
tour started With a Civic
Reception in the town hall
followed by a guided tour by
bus to Karlsruhe and the
surrounding area. In the
afternoon Axel and some of
his friends took the party by
car into the Black Forest
and a very pleasant after-
noon was spent walking in
the snow covered hills.
This short football tour
was made especially enjoy-
able by the generous hos-
pitality of the German hosts
who soon became very good
friends of all the players and
it is hoped that sometime in
the future I.C. will be able
to repay their hospitality.
