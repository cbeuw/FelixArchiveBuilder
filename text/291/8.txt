Records-by Phil Taylor
Felix Literary critic,
Barry Pywell, reviews a
new range of paper-
backs in his own inimit-
able style.
In April Granada pub-
lishers launched a new
series of paperbacks with
suitably glossy eye-catching
covers. Any I.C. student
wishing ito diversify could
do worse than cast his eye
in the direction of this new
"Paladin" range. From the
catholic selection of titles I
culled a few attractive
blooms.
Homo Ludens, by Johan
Huizinga, is described by a
more knowledgeable critic
than I, as ' the most import-
ant work in the philosophy
of history in our century'.
Following a discussion of
what play is, the learned
scholar proceeds to demon-
strate just how deeply " cul-
ture " (e.g., law, war, poetry,
music, philosophy, art, inter-
national relations, etc.) is
affected by the need to play.
The pursuit of the Mil-
lenium, by Norman Cohn, is
a beautiful book, and it gave
me the rare feeling of read-
ing some first class non-
fiction. His study of the
revolts of the urban masses
in the Middle Ages, how
they took the Biblical
Apocalypse and set about
searching for and destroying
the Anti-Christ, in the clergy
and among the Jews. Of how
the established church, al-
most submerged, had to
quash these revolts. Cohn
weaves his way through the
intricate variations in this
theme in a remarkably read-
able manner. He tells of the
touching faith of the Flagel-
lants, Brethren of the Free
Spirit, the Ropheta and the
Paupres, Whose faiths were
distorted by m e s s i a n i c
leaders who invariably re-
garded themselves as at
least equal to Christ or God.
I opened Bomb Culture,
attracted by the author, Jeff
Nuttan, who is no mean
poet, but was sadly disap-
pointed. I waded through
this turgid, personal docu-
ment as far as chapter four
before being submerged—
this book must be a hit
amongst K i n g s R o a d
trendies.
Other new releases in this
series include Crime and
Personality, by H . J.
Eysenck, a psychologist who
expounds for the layman
controversial and difficult
concepts in simple language.
On the track of Unknown
Animals, by Bernard House-
man, the biologist who re-
fuses to believe that an
animal doesn't exist until its
existence has been positively
disproved.
Van der Graaf Generator
" The least we can do is
wave to each other " CAS
1007
This album marks the re-
turn of a group who vaguely
flourished last year and then
due to several reasons split
up last June. However the
leader Peter Hammill per-
severed and reformed the
group to produce a record
that is eye opening to say
the least.
Many may have heard the
track " Refugees " already,
and I can say that initial
hearing gives a sensation not
experienced since " A Whiter
Shade of Pale ".
Every track is an indi-
vidual fable, yet the whole
record is a fable in itself.
Some may call it a pre-
monition—a quote from
Einstein is part of " After
The Flood " and predicts the
downfall of man, which cer-
tainly leaves room for
thought.
The finished result is
frighteningly wonderful—the
title is part of a quotation
from someone called John
Minton: " We're all awash
in a sea of blood and the
least we can do is wave to
each other " while the cover
design can sum up the
theme of the record.
The strength of appeal of
this record will solely
depend on the frame of
mind of the listener on the
initial hearing—that's it in a
nutshell.

Cat Stevens "Mona Bone
Jakon " ILPS 9118
During the time he has
been out of the public eye,
Cat has been both con-
valescing and pupating, and
now the newly emerged
singer has much more to
offer, as seen on this record.
None of the tracks are
brilliant, but some are close
gems. Tracks like " F i l l M y
Eyes " and " Maybe You're
Right" depict a writing
ability never revealed in his
chart days.
I would guess that one of
his biggest recent influences
has been Donovan—the
session musicians Cat uses
back up his style. One of the
worse tracks, " PopStar " is
deliberately meant to be
bad in order to illustrate the
point about his top ten days,
but most of Cat's writing
and Paul Samwell-Smith's
production make a comple-
mentary team for today's
selective muSic world.

Marsupilami Tra 213
Over the past year a few
completely new forms of
musical art have emanated
from the West Country, the
most notable being Prin-
cipal E d w a r d s Magic
Theatre.
Now from Taunton comes
Marsupilami, a six person
group. They have made few
appearances in London and
so may not have the reputa-
tion to back up this record.
A l l the same it is a
pleasing sound and the group
seems closely interwoven
musically. Jessica Stanley-
Clarke, the only female,
plays the flute with feeling
and Leary Hasson on organ
and Mike Fouracre (a truly
Somerset name) on per-
cussion reinforce one an-
other notably on " A b Initio
Ad Finem "—a miniature
opera.
My main criticism is'that
the vocals—sometimes sung
and sometimes spoken—tend
to clog instrumental ability.
They are a group that
badly need bringing to the
public eye, but whether this
record is aired enough is
another question.

At this time when badly
recorded albums like Har-
vest are costing 45/- it is
good to see that C.B.S. offer
a good double album for
29/11. Called " F I L L Y O U R
H E A D W I T H R O C K "
(SPR 39/40) it contains
tracks by many of their
artists, but judging by the
number they house, they
could easily bring out an-
other equally good double
album as well. Good tracks
on this album are by
Leonard Cohen, Tom Rush,
Laura Nyro, Chicago, Sa
tana, Spirit, and represent-
ing the British, A l Stewart,
Trees and Skin Alley (two
Nofcting Hill groups).
Easily a record for stu-
dents on short grants.
Few good singles are
issued now that L.P.'s are
flourishing, but one of the
best recently is " C A T -
F O O D " (WIP 6080) by
King Crimson, minus Ian
MacDonald and Mike, Giles,
plus Keith Tippet, the jazz
pianist (not a permanent
member).
Their L.P. due for May
release contains a longer
version of this single and
also features Mel Collins
from Circus on saxaphone.

PUZZLE CORNER
If the thought of exams
depresses you, try these.
1. Can you change C R O W
to R O O K in five moves?
(only one letter per move).
2. Rearrange the follow-
ing letters to form a Maori
nonsense word.
F F O O O F O I N G .
3. Take four moles and
arrange them into a square.
Now challenge your mate to
rearrange them to form three
triangles by moving only
two of the moles (and with-
out bending any).
4. Amaze your friends:
Get your mate to stand with
his toes touching the wall
and his eyes tightly shut.
Now, announce that you are
going to hypnotise him, but
instead, kick him in the
back and take all his money.
Notice his amazement.
5. What am I ?
My first is in string but
not in twine
My seoond is in port but
not in wine.
M y third is in fuel but not
in gas.
My fourth is in mule but
not in ass.
My fifth is in rock but not
in salt.
My sixth is in lock but not
in bolt.
Put me together and I
may puzzle you a little.
6. Strange but True.
Clench both fists tightly
and place them on the table
in front of you. Close your
right eye and stare at your
right fist for half a minute.
Now, close your right eye
(having opened your left)
and stare at your left fist for
half a minute. Repeat this
several times.
Gradually a sense of in-
tense disappointment will
come over you.
