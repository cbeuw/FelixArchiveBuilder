NUS mount massive campaign against unemployment
Teachers-3/8 face dole
Mood of militancy grows
How our graduates fare
L A S T S U M M E R , 739 people
(665 men, 74 women) graduated
from I C . Of these, 7'/2 % (50) of
the men and 9.4% (7) of the
women were s t i l l seeking jobs
at the end of last December.
The overall proportion c f grad-
uates s t i l l unemployed a t
that
time w a s 10.1%, according to
the U n i v e r s i t y of London
Careers Advisory Service. T h i s
figure includes 2.6% of those
contacted who failed to reply.
The figure of 10.1% (for 1975)
compares with 7.8% in 1974,
11.9% i n 1973 and 10.9% i n
1972.
The feedback to departments
careers advisors on job offers
and acceptances registered by
prospective graduates suggest
no marked change from previous
years.
Post Grad AGM
R I C H A R D P A R K E R , currently
ICU A A O , w a s elected a s
Chairman of the P o s t Graduate
Group at their A G M on Wednes-
day. Gabrielle D a i ley and
Kate Ducie were elected a s
Treasurer a n d Secretary
respectively.
It w i l l be the first time for
quite sometime that the P o s t
Grad Group have started with
an active executive. T h e
Group w i l l be looking for
more representation for P G s
at a departmental l e v e l , a far
more worthwhile aim in Mr
P a r k e r ' s v i e w s .
From this, he hopes that
inter-der/artmental links c a n be
developed and strengthened.
The Group w i l l a l s o be
looking into ways of making
more contact with MSc students
who seem to be out on a
limb within the Group.
They are at present awaiting
the report of the working
party looking into P G studies
and w i l l base some of their
a c t i v i t i e s around any concrete
suggestions that emerge from
it.

B A N K L I M I T E D i s pleased to
announce that the enlargement
of the Sub-Branch premises in
Imperial C o l l e g e i s due to
commence on Monday 7th June.
The work i s expected to take
approximately three months,
finishing by the end of August.
It i s envisaged however, that
some inconvenience w i l l be
felt, not only by the Staff of the
Branch, but by a l l customers
and the Bank would l i k e to
take this opportunity of
apologising beforehand for any
discomfort suffered.
During alterations, which
eventually w i l l provide more
amenable conditions both sides
of the counter, the Branch W I L L
remain open. Of the s e r v i c e s
to be made available in the
new premises a C a s h D i s p e n s i n g
machine w i l l be installed and
those customers wishing to
prepare for this service are
invited to apply for the
necessary cards before hand.
Any customers wishing to
avoid the works area may make
other arrangements to cash
their cheques a n d B o b B a i n -
bridge w i l l be happy to d i s c u s s
details with them, although it
i s sincerely hoped that such,
extremes w i l l not be necessary
and that the inconvenience
w i l l be minimal.
T H E NUS this week stepped
up its campaign to get
15,000 trained teachers into
employment in schools in
England and Wales. N U S
headquarters, at Endsleigh
Street, i s acting a s an
emergency campaign machine,
handling what NUS President
Charles Clarke described a s
"the biggest and most
important campaign N U S h a s
ever mounted'."
101 c o l l e g e s of education
and two u n i v e r s i t i e s , Heriot-
Watt and G l a s g o w , are at
present i n occupation because
of the issue of unemployed
teachers. T h e occupations,
which began in Scotland a few
weeks ago, involve a l l 14,000
trainee teachers in Scotland,
and are not expected to e n d
in the foreseeable future.
Well a t t e n d e d . meetings of
the students unions involved
have preceded a l l the occup-
ations (1600 at Jordon h i l l ,
G l a s g o w ) . T h e occupations
have brought teacher training
to a standstill in Scotland.
Only necessary activities
such a s T e a c h i n g practice
examinations and payment of
staff wages have been a l l o w e d
to continue.
The militant response from
c o l l e g e s of education h a s met
with solid backing from the
N U S E x e c u t i v e . Campaign
plans announced for this
month w i l l cost a n estimated
£6000, a n d over the next two
weeks raising money for N U S ' s
fighting fund w i l l be a major
activity. Trade unions and
student unions a l i k e are being
asked to help with the necessary
financial aid for the campaign.
T h e man i n charge of the
" a c t i o n d e s k " at N U S
Headquarters i s N U S Deputy
President, A l a s t a i r Stewart.
"/ have never known a response
like this to an NUS call to
action. Thousands of trained
teachers will be on the dole
at a cost of 55% of what it
would cost to employ them.
Even the Government must
soon see how ridiculous, and
how embittering this is.",
he says.
In addition, unemployment
information d e s k s are to be
set up in each S U i n the
country. T h e numbers of new
graduates unemployed this year
w i l l be collected and sent to
N U S , who hope to release full
figures o n graduate unemploy-
ment by June 14.
In an attempt to increase
public awareness o f graduate
unemployment, leaflets, posters,
and a s p e c i a l l y — prepared
tabloid-style broadsheet are
being prepared. T h e latter
should be ready for distribution
to students next week. T h i s
forms the backbone of a
campaign to get the facts and
f i g u r e s about g r a d u a t e
unemployment across to a l l
sections of the student
community. M P s w i l l be
lobbied as w i l l be the T U C
Special Conference on June 16.
Reaction to the campaign
has so far been favourable,
said N U S P r e s s Officer
F r a n c i s Beckett.
The campaign continues
tomorrow with a National
Conference of delegates from
C o l l e g e s of E d u c a t i o n and
education departments at
Manchester P o l y t e c h n i c . T h e
conference w i l l d i s c u s s the
campaign and the d e c i s i o n s
made for continuing it made
by the N U S E x e c u t i v e . T h i s
w i l l be followed by public
meetings from 7—11 June i n
five major c i t i e s : G l a s g o w
(7th), Manchester (8th),
Sheffield (9th), Cardiff (10th)
and Birmingham (1 Ith).
The m a s s i v e programme of
public meetings and demon-
strations culminates i n what i s
l i k e l y to be the biggest
national demonstration c a l l e d
by N U S on June 15th.
