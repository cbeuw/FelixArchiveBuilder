or not Stratford...
Y E S IT IS rte again, and no
I don't fancy myself a s some
great literary genius, but when
the editor of F E L I X marches
into the IF U n i o n , and s a y s ,
"I take it there's no IF O N L Y
article this w e e k " because
you've forgotten to a s k someone
to write one, there's nothing
for it, but to s i t down and write
one yourself. A n y w a y , I
suppose i t ' s a good e x c u s e for
a plug for the U n i o n . ( Y o u
didn't know we could sink to
those depths d i d you?) (That
was a pun.)
For those of you who haven't
seen or read the notices put
up by P a u l a , we have arranged
a day trip to Stratford-oh-Avon.
(Sorry f o l k s , Brighton and
Southend were booked up) we
have managed to procure 41
tickets for the matinee p e r ;
formance of a play by a
relatively unknown author
c a l l e d J u l i e t and Romeo (I've
just been told that my
information is incorrect. T h e
author is not c a l l e d J u l i e t and
Romeo, neither is the play. I
am confused.) We are leaving
at some unearthly hour of the
morning, like 8.30, (I wouldn't
quote me on that, and neither
would I), long before IC have
even considered getting up,
let alone starting c o l l e g e .
There w i l l be some espece
de sight-seeing trip before
the performance, and we
should get back well before
c l o s i n g timw. Not that that
has anything to do with it, of
course. T i c k e t s w i l l and do
cost £3.90 (luncheon vouchers
are not accepted), and are on
sale in the U n i o n , and do
come and buy them, a s they
are cluttering up the place.
Surely, brethren, this i s
a more worthy c a u s e than
74 kitkats, I8V2 c m s . of
typing paper, or 52 6 / 7
typing rubbers which you
might otherwise have spent
your well-earned grant/
baby-sitting money on.

LETTERS
Lacking motivation
Sir, — There have been a number
of articles and letters in F E L I X
recently, and echoed in your
editorial column last week, on
the boring nature of lectures.
When students s a y that they
found a lecture " b o r i n g " , what
they really mean,in most c a s e s ,
is that they were unable to
understand or follow it.
. When difficult material i s
encountered for the first time,
this must be expected, unless
one takes the trouble to read up
on it beforehand. T h e lectures
may then b e c o m e more
interesting! ( U n l e s s , of course,
the student has no interest in
h i s / h e r subject anyway; in
which c a s e he really h a s no
business at Imperial C o l l e g e ,
being bored to death at public
expense.)
What perhaps g a l l s many
students is that mastering a
s c i e n t i f i c or engineering
subject at an advanced level
requires hard work and long
hours of study. There are very
few short cuts, but n i c e , easy
short cuts are exactly what
B r i t a i n ' s pampered youth
want. Instead, they are given
worksheets (problem sheets)
which actually require them to
work!
I think the basic trouble
stems from the fact that
many, perhaps a majority,
of the students here have
no strong motivation for
studying their subject, or
even for being at university.
F e w sixth-formers choose
a university course out of a
strong desire to study that
particular subject, and even
fewer bother to find out what
studying that subject at
university would e n t a i l . In
these circumstances boredom i s
hardly unexpected, and while
the presentation of lectures
would certainly be a good
thing, it w i l l not s o l v e the
problem.
Yours sincerely
