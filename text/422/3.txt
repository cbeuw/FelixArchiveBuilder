NUS Response to the Grants
Announcement 1976/77
Discretionary Awards
The Grants announcement on Thursday 27th May d i d nothing f o r d i s c r e t i o n a r y awards except to c l a r i f y that one
course at one College d i d not merit a mandatory award. More than h a l f the members of NUS r e c e i v e no awards
at a l l o r l e s s than f u l l value awards because of the d i s c r e t i o n a r y powers of l o c a l a u t h o r i t i e s . The normal
excuse p r o f e r r e d by the DES for doing nothing on d i s c r e t i o n a r y awards, apart from the usual p u b l i c expenditure
c o n s i d e r a t i o n s , i s the lack of l e g i s l a t i v e time. On t h i s occasion there was no such excuse. The Education
B i l l 1975, the Comprehensive B i l l , i s c u r r e n t l y going through the House. Clause 7 of that B i l l extends
the range of designated courses to include the new higher diplomas of the Technical Education C o u n c i l &
the Business Education C o u n c i l . H i i s was a golden opportunity to extend mandatory p r o v i s i o n s t i l l f u r t h e r
to include a l l courses of advanced f u r t h e r education & to make proper f i n a n c i a l p r o v i s i o n f o r the 16-19 age
group, t h i s Government's s o - c a l l e d educational p r i o r i t y . Nothing has been done & once again increases i n
the main rate of grant have been used to mask a t o t a l l y inadequate & unjust settlement f o r the majority of
our members.
The Means T e s t
The Means Test stays v i r t u a l l y unchanged f o r another year. The DES have tampered w i t h the base of the means
t e s t s c a l e r a i s i n g i t from £2200 to £2700. But improvements i n the base w i l l do nothing to help the
majority of students whose parents earn i n excess of £4000. For parents above that l e v e l , the c o n t r i b u t i o n
has been reduced by only £20 & that i s assuming that parental income remains s t a t i c , which i s of course
u n l i k e l y . T h i s can only mean that the 57% of students now shown not to r e c e i v e a l l or part of t h e i r c o n t r i b u t i o n
w i l l be added to as the means test burden grows h e a v i e r . In the decade 1962 to 1972, the average value of
the student maintenance grant paid by l o c a l a u t h o r i t i e s has r i s e n by only 27% whereas the average p a r e n t a l
c o n t r i b u t i o n has r i s e n by 139%. This settlement w i l l continue that t r e n d . The fact that the settlement has
cost £30m, an increase on the previous grants b i l l of only 11% suggests that much of the cost of the settlement
w i l l come from the parents' pocket not the Government's.
There has been no a l t e r a t i o n i n the age of independance. Married students continue to be assessed on t h e i r
spouse's income o r worse s t i l l t h e i r parents. The concession granted on the three years earning r u l e which
w i l l mean that periods of time spent at home c a r i n g f o r c h i l d r e n w i l l count as s e l f - s u p p o r t , f o r the purpose
of e s t a b l i s h i n g independance, w i l l apply to married students o n l y , not to unmarried students. This i s
a p p a l l i n g d i s c r i m i n a t i o n against the unmarried.
The Main Rate
The main rate of grant has been increased from £740 to £875. On tlie face of i t t h i s looks to be more than
might have been expected i n the l i g h t of the Government's current pay p o l i c y . Closer i n s p e c t i o n does not bear
out t h i s f i r s t impression. We c a l c u l a t e d that students needed a minimum of £845 l a s t September i f they were to
have enough to cover t h e i r b a s i c needs. An award of £875 i n September 1976, twelve months l a t e r , goes no way
to meet that need. We asked for a grant that would meet costs i n the middle of the academic year f o r which i t
i s p a i d . Instead t h i s settlement takes l i t t l e account of the i n f l a t i o n we have already seen t h i s academic y e a r .
I n f l a t i o n i n March s t i l l stood at 21%. An increase of 18% i n a t o t a l l y inadequate grant of £740 coupled w i t h
a heavier means test burden can only mean even further reduced l i v i n g standards f o r students next y e a r . The
whole main rate settlement suggests a naive b e l i e f i n the Government's a n t i - i n f l a t i o n p o l i c y and i t s
o p t i m i s t i c b e l i e f that i n f l a t i o n w i l l be down to s i n g l e f i g u r e s i n February of next year.
The new arrangements f o r vacation support w i l l a l s o have an impact on the s t u d e n t ' s spending power. The nRS
are not going to p u b l i s h any breakdown of the grant butwe know that the vacation element w i l l be i n the region
of £11.35 per week i n the short v a c a t i o n s . If we allow for there being eight weeks i n the short vacations
t h i s puts the t o t a l vacation element at £90.80. This means an increase i n the term-time grant of 17%. (£740
minus £70 (vac element 1975/6) = £670; £875 minus £90 (vac elemnet 1976/7) = £785; an increase of £115 o r 17%.)
The DES w i l l not s p e c i f y the number of weeks the new vacation element i s meant to cover i n the short v a c a t i o n s ,
so students with short vacations of more than eight weeks i n t o t a l are l i k e l y to s u f f e r as a r e s u l t .
There are only two aspects of the settlement which can be welcomed. The f u l l cost of medical insurance f o r
students going abroad as part of t h e i r course w i l l now be p a i d as part of t h e i r grant. The r e l a x i n g of the
three year s e l f - s u p p o r t from earnings r u l e to allow students who have claimed s i c k n e s s , i n v a l i d i t y o r maternity
b e n e f i t to count those periods as s e l f - s u p p o r t should mean that more students than p r e v i o u s l y w i l l be granted
independent s t a t u s .
