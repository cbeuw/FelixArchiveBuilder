NUS Travel's New Low Fares on Eurotrain
S A V E U P to 50% of normal rail fares to more than 60
destinations this summer with Eurotrain — the first fully
integrated student rail network.
A s an added bonus N U S Travel is offering even larger
reductions on selected routes. P r i c e s include P a r i s f o r
£10.20, Madrid for £26.65, Rome for £26.45 and B r u s s e l s
for £7.85.
A s well a s students and scholars a l l young people under
the age of 21 c a n take advantage of the frequent Eurotrain
programme. During the summer months trains run daily to
most major European c i t i e s .
The Eurotrain symbol gives complete confidence and
reliability, both in this country and abroad. T r a v e l l i n g
across Europe is now easier than ever before with foreign
student train operators working together to provide this
comprehensive s e r v i c e .
One important feature to note is that Eurotrain tickets
guarantee reserved seats at no extra cost on nearly all
trains leaving London.
