Patches of pumpkins
Sophia Goldberg on how to bring out your pumpkins’ inner ghouls
For the perfect pumpkin you will need a
pumpkin (surprise surprise), a large spoon, a
pencil, a and tea light, one small and one large
knife, plus lots of newspaper. If you plan on
carving multiple pumpkins it’s best to do it
outside. If you’re cutting them inside, be sure
to cover the table properly with newspaper.
What to do with all that pumpkin post-Halloween

Pumpkin Soup
Extremely easy and delicious! (Even if
you don’t like pumpkin!)
Ingredients:
1 medium onion
1 leek
1 pumpkin (preferably onion squash)
2 tbsp olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Chopped chillies
Peel the pumpkin and chop it in small
cubes. Chop the onion and leeks.
Heat the olive oil in the pan and add
the onion and leeks. Cook for about
7 minutes on medium-low heat (or
until they are brown) and then add
the pumpkin. Add water so that the
pumpkin is covered well, add the salt
and pepper and cook until the pump-
kin is soft. Place the soup in a blender
and blend until smooth. Place the
soup back in the pan and add water
until you have the consistency you
prefer. Serve hot and add some fresh
chopped chillies to break the sweet-
ness of the pumpkin.
Draw a circle of diameter about 5 inches (de-
pending on the size of the pumpkin) on the
top of the pumpkin. Cut this out using a large
knife, ensuring that the knife is at a 45 degree
angle to the surface of the pumpkin (other-
wise the lid with fall into the pumpkin when
you replace it).
Put the lid to one side and remove the seeds
inside with a large spoon – the small knife
may also be useful for this.
Draw a face onto the pumpkin. If you want to
keep to the traditional scary face, draw two
triangular eyes, one triangular nose and a
creepy jagged mouth.
Use the markings to cut around with the
knife. Make sure you cut perpendicularly to
the surface of the pumpkin.
You can create detail using the smaller knife. Place a lit tea light inside the pumpkin and replace the lid. Enjoy your spooky pumpkin!

roast for approximately half an hour,
ﬂipping them halfway through. Feel
free to use any mix of spices and
herbs instead of paprika to make
things interesting. For a spicy ﬂavour
try chilli, or rosemary for a more mild
ﬂavour.
Pumpkin Cake
NB: Nope, this is not a dessert like
pumpkin pie – think savoury turnip
cake from dim sum restaurants, just
made with pumpkin instead! This
recipe needs a bit more elbow grease
and requires use of a steamer, but the
results are well worth the eﬀort.
Ingredients:
700g pumpkin, cubed
200g rice ﬂour
500ml water
2 tbsp cornstarch
1 tbsp dried shrimp
1 tsp ﬁve spice powder
Soak the dried shrimp in some water
for 15 minutes. Steam the pumpkin
until soft, then mash it up ﬁnely and
add the rice ﬂour, cornstarch, ﬁve
spice powder, shrimp and water. Pour
the mixture into a dish and steam for
10 minutes.
Slice and serve as-is, or lightly pan-
fry both sides to crisp it up a little bit
before serving.
