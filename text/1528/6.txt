FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER
Students use spy like stealth and
cunning to gain entry to Beit roof
toilets and kitchens. The hall was
packed with students all trying to ﬁnd
some sort of window to look out of.
There seemed to be many diﬀerent op-
tions, all oﬀering diﬀerent views, and
diﬀerent quality views. Felix managed
to perch inside the Union Building it-
self and take photos from the window
of as many people as they could. Snaps
ranging from Dame Judi Dench to JLS
being told to go round the side rather
than the front entrance were obtained,
with a varying degree of success and
blurriness.
However some students went even
further in their eﬀorts to get a peek at
the red carpet and managed to climb
up onto the roof of Beit Hall.
According to students that were on
the roof, who wish to remain anony-
mous, there was a ﬁre door that led
out onto the rooftop that was not
guarded by security on the night.
The door was on the Beit fourth ﬂoor
by the east. It said that the door was
alarmed, but it was, in fact, not. This
door was able to be opened, and stu-
dents went on to the roof from there.
Then, from the outside, there is a door
into the Union, which could not be
opened from inside but can be opened
from the outside.
Concerns were raised about the stu-
dent’s actions as the rooftop of Beit is
considered dangerous due to it being
a sheer drop, and it is unsafe for stu-
dents to be there and so close to the
edge.
The students added, “I was surprised
how easy it was to get on the roof. It
probably should be more secure but
not too secure. When we went to
security, no-one was there Security
was very low”. The student added that
“Great view! We should come up here
more often. Can’t wait for the next
RAH Premier”.
Beit Security were unable to com-
ment on the student’s presence on the
rooftop. Felix could not get a quote in
time about the incident, but is hoping
to follow up later and, at the very least,
have something online.
Once the audience had all gone into
the Royal Albert Hall, the crowds
quickly dissipated and the mission
(no pun intended) to remove all of
the structures that were created could
get underway. By 2am on Wednesday
24 October, all of the structures that
were put up were removed and the last
truck was leaving.
