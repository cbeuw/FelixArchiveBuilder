Free storage space for Imperial
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Every student at Imperial can get 8Gb
worth of free storage on the online
website Dropbox. This is part of the
Dropbox Space Race.
In this competition student race
against each other to earn more
points, which entitles them to more
space online in the Dropbox web-
site. Imperial is currently third in the
United Kingdom (table pictured to the
left), with 2,233 participants (at time
of writing).
The competition works by
students registering with
their Imperial email ad-
dress, or, if you have an
account under a diﬀerent
email address, verifying
that you go to Imperial
on the Dropbox Space Race
website. The more students
who sign up, the more free space
that every student
at that institution
gets. Currently, at
time of going to print,
Imperial students
are able to get 8Gb
worth of free space. The
maximum possible space
that an institution can gain is
25Gb.
Usually, the amount of space given
to each user is 5Gb. The extra 3Gb to
Imperial students will, however, only
be available for two years.
The competition was launched on
Monday 15 October, and will run
for eight weeks, meaning two of the
weeks have already gone.
