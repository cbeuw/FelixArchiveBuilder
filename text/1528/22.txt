22 FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER
Becky Lane tells of the issues with ephemeral initiatives
Becky Lane
The problem with “Green Week”
e are all guilty
of not being as
green as we could
be. I know for one
that I am guilty of
chucking recyclables in my little desk
bin at times when the journey to the
recycling bin (just outside of my of-
ﬁce) seems too far. Yet I just can’t help
but feel that hosting a Green Week is
not the way to combat these behav-
iours.
Traditionally a Green Week takes
the form of a series of small events
leading up to a big event at the end of
the week. This big change could be a
campus wide switch oﬀ of comput-
ers or some other green initiative. My
fundamental problem with the con-
cept of a ‘Week’ celebration whether
it’s about sustainability, LGBT rights
or absolutely anything else; is that they
aren’t fostering a change in attitude.
Surely the point of any green initia-
tive should be to embed sustainability
into the consciousness of everyone
across college both staﬀ and students.
Instead I feel we end up with grand
tokenistic gestures which do little to
change attitudes. To be completely
honest after doing some research I
can’t help but feel that Imperial Col-
lege simply isn’t doing enough to im-
prove its environmental sustainability.
Every year People and Planet publish
a green league table of universities
using a ranking system based on en-
vironmental and ethical performance.
I’m aware that all league tables have
their ﬂaws (let’s not start talking about
the NSS here) but in 2012 Imperial
College was placed at 96th, this is a
fall from a placing of 78th in 2011. The
league table looks at a plethora of dif-
ferent sustainability and environmen-
tal criteria and awards each institution
with a degree classiﬁcation – Imperial
got a 2.2. For an institution that strives
for excellence this is surely not what
we should be aiming for?
We have all heard the standard ex-
cuses when it comes to green issues;
‘Turning my lights oﬀ won’t make a
diﬀerence’ and ‘To gain excellence in
research its necessary to leave this (in-
sert scientiﬁc apparatus with high en-
ergy consumption here) on all night’.
The point of this piece is not to argue
with either of these stances, merely
just to say that I think if we want wide
scale change we need buy in from a lot
of individuals. I am not criticising Col-
lege and putting the Union on a ped-
estal. The Union recognises that it has
a way to go with green initiatives. But
this is something very much on the
radar, the Union has just received a
quote to increase the number of glass
washers further decreasing the use of
plastic skiﬀs. It is not just the direct
environmental eﬀect that this will
have that it is important, it is the idea
of establishing the role that sustaina-
bility plays in the culture of the Union.
So this is all very well and good,
but how to do go about ‘changing
a culture’ and making a diﬀerence,
well I would argue that is not for
me to sit and dictate from my oﬃce.
To eﬀect change on a campus wide
basis we need student involvement
at every level from the very begin-
ning. This is the cheesy bit where I
say WE NEED YOU. Myself and the
Environmental Oﬃcer will be host-
ing a Green Forum at the Union on
Friday 2nd November from 12.30-
13.30 in Meeting room 8, Union
building. If you agree with the senti-
ment of this article come along, and
importantly if you don’t then also
please come along to air your views
and get the ball rolling. I promise
to stop throwing my recyclables in
my desk bin, but that alone is not
enough…
Apparently being
green means we
get to have beer
in a glass!
