Conferences at Imperial
The Windows to
technology?
Aemun Reza News Editor
Two pages of Features about conferences run by students
taking place here at Imperial. Page 8-9
As a lot of you must know, because
it would almost have been impossible
to miss for even the keenest attendee
of the Library, the new James Bond
movie Skyfall premiered at the Royal
Albert Hall on Tuesday night. Prince
Consort Road was partially closed oﬀ
and access was restricted around the
area.
A massive red carpet was set up
all around the Royal Albert Hall,
Bond themes were played on repeat,
and even the banners outside were
changed to say 007.
Eager fans queued up from earlier
than 12:30pm for the event at 5pm,
and the road was packed with people
by the time it started. The entrance to
Beit was closed to the public and only
students who presented their Imperial
College ID were allowed past.
Many Imperial students took advan-
tage of their buildings and watched
the premiere from the Roderic Hill
and Bone building windows. Every
window was ﬁlled with people trying
to get a glimpse of Daniel Craig and
other celebrities at the event. Lectur-
ers could also be seen standing in the
windows and on other places.
For residents of Beit, there was a
great view from their windows,

Constitution to change?
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
The Constitutional changes that were
proposed and previously reported in
Felix, are set to be put to a vote at the
next Council on Tuesday 30 October.
Council will vote whether or not they
will accept the changes, or if it needs
to be revised more. The draft still con-
tains the changes discussed in the pre-
vious article.
The Constitution is the document
that sets up the rules and regulations
under which the Union is supposed to
be run.
Paul Beaumont, Union President,
consulted with individuals on a one-
to-one basis and is now ready to
present the changes to Council. Al-
though, over the weekend, there will
be some alterations made.
One such alteration that is believed
to be being made is in relation to the
powers that the bar managers have.
Before the alteration, an alcohol li-
censee (bar manager) would have had
the power to discipline students, how-
ever, Beaumont said that the inclusion
was an accident and that is will be re-
moved.
The proposals have caused some
friction between Beaumont and Court
over them, and to what extent changes
are being occurred and how it will af-
fect the representation that students
have in the running of the Union.
There is currently a 26 page document
up on the website detailing the Court’s
opinions on the changes, and Beau-
mont is expected to be releasing his
reply to this soon. >>3
