30 FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER
Fifty Shades Ye
6. Roger Moore
It’s about quality, not quantity, which is why, even after 7 films, more than any actor has
so far managed, Moore finds himself on the bottom of our “Best Bond” list. He lacked the
suave charisma of Connery, and turned the franchise into a bit of a camp joke. Sure he had
more potential when it came to comedy but there is no denying that he has the silliest,
most dreadful 007 films under his name. Plus towards the end of his run, he looked so old
and frail that it was simply embarrassing for him to be saving the world.
5. George Lazenby
Famous for being the only Bond who actually managed to tie the knot (although that
didn’t last very long), he’s also the only Bond actor to only complete a single feature.
The reason? He had big shoes to fill after the original Connery. And due to his lack of
experienceinthefilmindustry(heworkedasamodelbeforethis),verylittleconsideration
was given to him as a leading actor at the time. Plus the critics and audience weren’t too
keen on an Australian playing Britain’s favourite spy. So he left.
Happy birthday Mr. Bond – 50 years and you’re still going strong. God knows your stamina is u
22. Moonraker (1979)
The most embarrassing
entry.RogerMooregoes
to space to fight some
bad guys firing tacky
looking laser guns. They
couldn’t even come up
with a new villain, and
creating a love story for
Jaws was the silliest,
most unnecessary move
this franchise has ever
made.
21. A View to a Kill
(1985)
Christopher Walken
makes a mean villain,
but with the presence of
the incredibly annoying
Tanya Roberts as the
main girl and a Bond
who looks too old to
be driving around and
saving the world, Roger
Moore’s last effort is
also one of his weakest.
19. Diamonds are
Forever (1971)
Connery really should
have quit before this
one, and perhaps to
accommodate his
ageing, the film takes
on a never-before-seen
campy tone that doesn’t
settle well. The less that
is said about the awful
“Bambi and Thumper”
duo, the better.
20. OHMSS (1969)
Bond gets married:
now that’s something
that should never have
happened, and despite
the ambitious skiing
action scenes, it’s a
long, challenging watch,
with the charisma-free
George Lazenby taking
on the role, never to
come back again after
this. Good riddance.
18. Quantum of Solace
(2008)
Over-stuffed, confused
and failing at every
attempt to live up to
its direct predecessor
Casino Royale, Daniel
Craig’s second outing as
James Bond is as chaotic
as its theme song,
performed for the first
time as a duet by Alicia
Keys and Jack White.
17. The Living
Daylights (1987)
Timothy Dalton’s first
stab at a Bond film
doesn’t work out too
well. While a huge step
up from A View to a Kill,
Dalton’s attempt to turn
the series around into
something gritter never
quite succeeds due to
an agonisingly weak set
of villains.
16. Octopussy (1983)
Octopussy’s (the sultry
Maud Adams) circus
girls are occasionally
useful, the mysterious
“Faberge Egg” is pretty
to look at, but dressing
up Roger Moore as a
clown and yes, a gorilla,
is taking things a little
too far, even for the
lighter, more comic
Moore to handle.
15. The World is Not
Enough (1999)
Now this is a tricky one:
the villains are excellent:
Robert Carlyle as the
man who cannot feel,
and Sophie Marceau as
the seductive femme
fatale. But the Bond
Girl, Denise Richards, is
one of, if not, the worst
that has ever been
paired up with 007.
