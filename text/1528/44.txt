Slitherlink
Licensed to kill? (for real this time)
More slitherlinky goodness for the dedi-
cated puzzle solver. Your aim is to make a
single closed loop by joining the dots so that
numbered squares are surrounded by the
corresponding number of lines (e.g. a square
numbered 2’ can only have one line on two of
its sides).
As you can see, we are trying to phase in
all sorts of new puzzles, so do send us your
opinion on them. For instance, if you think
Knights and Knaves is horrible, tell us so, and,
although you will make me very, very sad,
we will (probably) listen to popular demand
and punt it. Similarly, if you think that varia-
tions on Sudoku are the best thing since sliced
bread, we’ll try to include more of them.
You arrive at a remote district of the Island of Knights and Knaves, and you come
across two locals, Aaron and Barbara. The following exchange takes place:
You: Are you both knights?
Aaron: Ja.
You (turning to Barbara): Is your friend a knight?
Barbara: Da.
Youimmediatelyrealisethat“ja”and“da”arethetopicaldialect’swordsfor “yes”and
“no”, but you have no idea which means what.
Who’s a knight and who’s a knave? What do “ja” and “da”mean?
If Andy is a knight, then he doesn’t know his colour and so sees one and only one white hat.
Then Bob is a knave, and he is wearing a white hat while also seeing Dan with a white hat, a
contradiction. As such, Andy is a knave, and so either sees Bob, Chris and Dan wearing either
two or no white hats. From Bob’s statement, we know Bob and Dan are wearing black, and so
Chris is wearing black as well. Dan accuses Andy of lying, and so is truthful, while Chris falsely
says he doesn’t know his colour. In summary, Andy, Bob, Chris, and Dave are a knave, a knight,
a knave and a knight wearing white, black, black, and black.

Thermometer Sudoku
It’s like the regular Sudoku you all know
and love, but with a twist. You need to
make sure that each row, column, and box
contains all numbers from 1 to 9, but the
added complication is that in each ther-
mometer, numbers must be in (strictly)
increasing order, (starting from the bulb).

EXTRA BONUS
PUZZLE
Arrange the numbers
11223344
in such a way that there is
one number between the
ones, two numbers between
the twos, three numbers be-
tween the threes and four
numbers between the fours.
Solving the nonogram is
easy: the numbers show you
the length of the groups of
black squares as well as how
many of them there are in a
row or column.
