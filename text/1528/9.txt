half way across the UK to
attend this event

a climate fo-
rum centered at
Imperial would be, where
we have a hub of scientists and engi-
neers brimming with knowledge, cre-
ativity and great ideas in one of the
most inﬂuential and cultural cities in
the world. (I’ll leave that spiel there
before I start sounding like Boris
Johnson talking about the Olympics)
So, nine months on and several hun-
dred emails later we are very happy
to be able to invite you all to the
London Climate Forum 2012.
This inaugural event will take
place on the 24th and 25th
November in Imperial Col-
lege’s
Great Hall and is coordinated by Im-
perial Hub. We are invit-
ing students
a n d
y o u n g
people from
Imperial, London, and the
rest of the UK to be part of the hot-
test student debate - pun very much
intended.
We’ve invited some incredible speak-
ers to come along to talk,
including Profes- sor Sir
Brian Hoskins, Di- r e c t o r
of the Grantham I n s t i -
tute for Cli- mate
C h a n g e ,
J a m e s
Cam-
eron
(not
he London Climate Fo-
rum is the UK’s largest
student led conference
on climate change and
sustainability. Bringing
together leading thinkers from poli-
tics, business, campaigning, media,
science and engineering, it will be
a chance for young people and stu-
dents to ﬁnd out how they can be
part of creating a more sustainable
future.
But why should you care?
Well, the consequences of a
changing climate and re-
source scarcity are set to
impact on each our lives.
Whether this is due to oil
shortages (maybe), freak
weather events (prob-
ably) or changes in food
and water supply (almost
deﬁnitely), it is becoming
clearer and clearer that
change in inevitable.
But not only will climate
change and sustainability
challenges eﬀect us, it will be
down to us, the students of to-
day and leaders of tomorrow to
help pave the way to a more sus-
tainable planet. Come 2030 when we
are the key decision makers, we need
to make sure that we are making the
right ones not just for ourselves but
also for the entire planet.
I’ve been interested in Climate
Change and sustainability for a while
now and back in February, I ventured
to Oxford on a snowy winter’s
morning to attend the Oxford
Climate Forum (see “Gate-
crashing the Oxford Climate
Forum” in the February
16th is- sue of Felix). It was
a fan- tastic day of talks
a n d discussions and
d e - bates and I came
away feeling in-
spired. As I
sat on the train
back to Lon-
don I thought
about 1: how
n i c e
i t
the ﬁlm director- although that
would be kind of cool too), Founder
and Non-Executive Chairman of Cli-
mate Change Capital, Carmel Mc-
Quaid, Climate Change Manager at
Marks & Spencers and our favorite
campus celebrity, Professor Lord
Robert Winston, Professor of Sci-
ence and Society at Imperial
College, politician, scientist,
author and t.v presenter.
The list of knowledge-
able and inspiring high
proﬁle speakers really
does go on.
The London Climate
Forum will be your
chance to hear from
the experts, learn
some more about
what we need to be
doing to confront
climate and sustain-
ability challenges, and
start to ﬁgure out how
you can play your part
in making a positive
change. Whether that is
setting up a project dur-
ing your time at university,
like e.quinox, a student-led
project that brings cost-eﬀec-
tive, sustainable renewable en-
ergy to developing countries (who
will also be speaking at the Forum),
or in your future career as a banker,
scientist, engineer, consultant, doc-
tor... Either way, sustainability is go-
ing mainstream and will
be aﬀecting us all
in some way
shape or
f o r m ,
w h i c h
means it’s time
for us all to start
paying attention to
this issue.

London
Climate
Forum
says “Sustainability is going to oﬀer
exciting and challenging opportuni-
ties to us all throughout our future
careers and lives, you actually can’t
avoid it. I think that being able to in-
teract, understand and beneﬁt from
it is of fundamental value when plan-
ning ahead. Coming to the Forum
means hearing from the best about
what’s happening at the edge of this
fascinating topic, having a vision
for the future and taking a positive
step towards being part of the most
critical discussion of our generation”
Now, you can’t argue with that.
We’ll be promoting the London Cli-
mate Forum on campus over the next
few weeks. Watch this space for bake
sales, your chance to get involved
in some lunchtime arts and crafts,
and the most ambitious ﬂashmob to
hit Imperial to date (hopefully). In-
trigued? You should be. Insa Roem-
gens, one of the publicity team leads
said “I read about the Climate Forum
online earlier this term and thought
rather than just attend, the best way
I could help to make a diﬀerence was
to help put together an amazing and
inspiring event”. If you’d also like to
get involved there’s still time, email
climateforum@imperialhub.org for
more information.
So, if you are thinking about making
plans for the weekend of the 24th and
25th November, stop right now. Put
the dates in the diary and head on
over to www.londonclimateforum.
org to get your earlybird tickets
before they end next week.
See you there!
