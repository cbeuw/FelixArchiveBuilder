Shacking up with Business
Deepka Rana talks to Unishack.com’s founder, Ben Oakenfull
e all know that estate
agents and landlords
aren’t exactly a stu-
dent’s best friend, and
many of us have personally fallen vic-
tim of pushy sales tactics, resulting in
a less than ideal but extortionately ex-
pensive student ﬂat. Such experiences
prompted Ben, a ﬁnal year student at
Bournemouth University, to start his
very own online business. Unishack.
com allows students to rate their ac-
commodation in order to help those
currently looking to rent. Felix had the
opportunity to pick Ben’s brains about
running his own business whilst still
at University.
Is this your ﬁrst shot at starting a
business, and have you always aspired
to start one yourself?
When I was 15, I started a computer
support company that specialised in
‘At Home Support’. This quickly be-
came a small successful business how-
ever after a couple of years I decided
that I would go travelling for ﬁve
months before going to University. I
have always had a keen business acu-
men and a passion for web technolo-
gies, the perfect pair for starting Uni
Shack.
Had the idea Uni Shack not taken
oﬀ, what do you reckon you would be
doing now instead?
My plan B has always been to set up
a Web Development/Design company
– but hopefully I won’t have to worry
about that!
How did you go about building your
team, and how many people work for/
at Uni Shack?
I believe a great strength is to know
your weaknesses, and once you know
them you can build your team around
that. Following that analysis, I’ve
picked up the phone and got in con-
tact with a few friends who I know
also have a passion for business. The
team at Uni Shack comprises of four
people, including myself – two in
technical and two in marketing and
PR.
How have you found balancing your
academic commitments with running
your own business?
It really helps staying organised! My
University work is quite heavy at the
moment as I’m in my ﬁnal year, so
that takes priority. However I’m really
passionate about Uni Shack, so the
majority of my spare time is spent on
that. I’m quite fortunate that the busi-
ness relies on user generated content
so most of my time is spent on pro-
motion and further site development.
How are you planning on making
substantial revenues from the website
(or what other goals do you have for
the business)?
Our business model operates on a
series of diﬀerent revenue streams,
such as standard business to consum-
er advertising, and advertising the let-
ting agents/landlord contact details.
Soon letting agents and landlords will
be able to add a plugin to their site,
this plugin will show the rating and
comments of a property.
Would you advise students to start
a business whilst still studying or wait
until they have more experience/ﬁ-
nancial security?
I believe that if you have a good
enough idea and it is realistic then
why wait? If you have a fantastic idea
bottled up until you have more expe-
rience, then another company could
come in and get the market before
you – that wouldn’t be good!
Young entrepreneurs often tend to
run before they can walk. What would
you say are the best ﬁrst steps to take
with an exciting new business idea?
I’d say that the most important step
is to do your homework ﬁrst. You
need to understand the market for
your idea, and also where your main
revenue streams will come from.
Writing a business plan from the start
is always a good idea.
What has been the biggest hurdle so
far, and have you ever considered giv-
ing up?
The development of the site was
the easy part - the hurdle was getting
people to use the site. With a limited
budget that wasn’t easy. Uni Shack is a
good idea so I knew with persistence
students would eventually start rat-
ing. With the right team on board and
using social media to our advantage,
Uni Shack started to grow.
Have you ever run into issues with
letting agents and landlords objecting
Uni Shack? How do you ensure ratings
remain fair and reliable?
It has always been our number one
priority at Uni Shack to be neutral.
We strive to keep things amicable
between the student and the letting
agent or landlord. We ensure ratings
are fair and reliable by monitoring
each and every review that is submit-
ted, we will not approve a review that
contains profanities for example. We
are currently developing a portal that
allows letting agents and landlords to
log on, and comment on the student
reviews of their properties. So by do-
ing all of this, we haven’t run into any
issues with landlords or letting agents.
Are students not running the risk of
receiving no/very poor references from
previous landlords if they rate their
properties badly?
Protecting the identity of the re-
viewer is the answer to this. We do
not disclose their email address, ten-
ancy year, or any other information
that can relate back to them. We al-
ways advise any reviewer to express
their opinion in a way that does not
identify them. Plus the student can
always rate their property once they
have left.
What do you currently love and hate
about the ﬂat you’re currently living
in?
This is probably the best rented
property that I have lived in! My girl-
friend, Faye and I had a strict list of
requirements that we wouldn’t budge
on, it helps to know what things to
watch out for when looking for a new
place. I’d say the best thing about our
ﬂat is its town centre location, the
only thing we really disliked was the
