A Merlin-gering plot line
Corrie Berry tries to find the magic in the new season
he new series of Mer-
lin started three weeks
ago, and we tuned in
(on iPlayer) with an-
ticipation. I’m not go-
ing to lie – you don’t watch Mer-
lin for the brilliant graphics, or to
learn something new about the
way that Camelot and the Ar-
thurian legends played out. The
interpretation of the legends is
pretty straightforward – but what
this adaptation does bring to the
screen is a refreshing youth that is
not associated with the tales of old
in the way you would expect.
The ﬁrst few series surround
Prince Arthur (Bradley James) and
Merlin (Colin Morgan), and his
man-servant, a young man who is
hiding his magic from the King-
dom as it is highly forbidden. The
story has been slow to develop up
till the most recent series – Lady
Guinevere (Angel Coulby), Lance-
lot (Santiago Cabrera) and some of
the other most well-loved names
and faces in the story are slow to
appear, and there are a lot of ‘busy’
episodes – episodes where Merlin
is ﬁghting beasts and other nasties
without any actual plot develop-
ment. This is hilarious in itself –
the dragon, voiced by John Hurt,
is deﬁnitely one of my favourite
characters, and these busy epi-
sodes don’t necessarily detract
from the series. King Uther (An-
thony Head) is also a character
that you love to hate, and adds a
huge amount to the show.
The new series sees the begin-
ning of the Arthurian legends.
We’ve skipped three years since
the end of the last series – Arthur
is now King, and although Merlin
is still a young man, the old wiz-
ard of old has made an appearance
as an alter-ego of Merlin, who is a
known sorcerer and has got Ar-
thur and his Knights out of a fair
few scrapes. The Knights and Mer-
lin are in the wild searching for
Lady Morgana (Katie McGrath),
while Guinevere (Gwen) is back at
Camelot ruling in Arthur’s place.
Plot development seems pretty
rapid at this stage, and there are
some new beasts and creatures
that are fairly amusing. The last
episode I watched had some big
‘sperm’ creature in it – kind of a
cross between a ghost, a cone-
head and something out of Dr
Who. A new dragon has made
an appearance and Arthur is still
blissfully unaware of Merlin’s
magic, despite having been saved
a number of times already.
There’s some confusion over the
plot – an old druid has given Mer-
lin some clues as to who is going
to be the Big Bad in this series, but
this character appears to be Ar-
thur’s saviour, while some of the
best-loved characters start to have
shady, nastier aspects to their per-
sonality. The ﬁrst episode seemed
to be a cross between Lord of the
Rings, Game of Thrones and Har-
ry Potter, and we were constantly
making comparisons to other se-
ries.
However, despite all of this, there
is something that draws me to the
series. The dynamic between Mer-
lin and Arthur is hilarious. I love
the characters because I have been
watching from the beginning – in
fact, we used to do “Merlin Night”
parties at each other’s houses dur-
ing term-time; a good excuse to
watch TV and get drunk when
we got bored of clubbing. You
deﬁnitely want to watch this with
friends. It’s always interesting to
see how the series is going to pro-
gress –whether in a positive or
negative direction, it’s deﬁnitely
an entertaining thing to watch.

One hundred episodes in and Kevin
appears to be going soft. The once
heavily-critical McCloud whole-
heartedly embraces the irrefuta-
bly crazy Lee and Graham who are
embarking on the restoration and
redesign of a central London wa-
ter tower. With a build period of
eight months, the construction
site resembles a busy commut-
er tube. With sewage workers,
plasterers and conservationists
all working at the same time it’s
a delicate jigsaw to bring the
building together on time.

sort of panoramas

penthouse of the

sanely beauti-
ful and

vistas
have
t h e
potential to make you dizzy with
a sense of awe (not to mention
vertigo). The finished article does
not fail to leave a normally shock-
proof Kevin nothing short of gasp-
ing.
A good reference to alpacas, a
dodgy lift journey and a sumptu-
ous six man bath plus his-and-his
showers add slightly more light
hearted touches to an otherwise
whirlwind episode.
Ambitious designs, limited
money and finances quickly spi-
ralling out of control, this land-
mark episode does not fail to
disappoint and is indeed a very
grand design.
