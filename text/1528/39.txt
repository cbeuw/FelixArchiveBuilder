Steakday, bloody steakday
Here during the Halloween season,
we’re more than happy to cater to all
levels of “vampirism” – and by that, we
mean we’re going to scrutinize how to
cook the perfect beef steak.
First up, pick your pieces. We don’t
discriminate on cut, but one thing
we’re certainly picky about is quality.
With steak you get what you pay for,
so get chummy with your butcher –
or, if you must, go for the fresh coun-
ter in the supermarket. Whatever you
do, don’t you DARE reach for the pre-
packed meats in the Tesco chiller cab-
inets. Dickenson’s on 365 North End
Road is one of our favourite picks for
quality meat without the crazy price
tag – it’s well worth checking out.
A good steak should be deep red in
colour and have suﬃcient fat marbling
through it (look for the faint white
lines), as this ensures great ﬂavour and
that the steak won’t dry out during
cooking. Get your butcher to trim the
fatty layer on the steak if it’s too thick
– you’ll need a bit for ﬂavour, around
half a centimetre should do.
Next must-have: ageing. Done prop-
erly beforehand by your butcher, this
develops the ﬂavor and makes sure
your meat will be tender so it won’t
turn out the texture of tyre rubber.
Ask your butcher how long it’s been
hung for – rule of thumb is that you
want it aged between 21-35 days.
So you’ve ﬁnally brought it home,
now it’s time to cook! Whether you’re
cooking it immediately or storing it in
the fridge for later, it’s crucial to make
sure you bring the steak up to room
temperature. Otherwise, you’ll be “en-
joying” a piece of meat that’s seared
outside but stone-cold in the centre.
Grab a heavy-bottomed pan and
whack it on high heat. Cast iron is
good if you can get it; but as long as it’s
got a thick/heavy bottom it’ll do – try
to avoid non-stick because it makes it
harder for a crust to form. Add a thin
layer of oil, and season your steak with
salt while you wait for it to get smok-
ing hot so it kick-starts the formation
of that lovely crust (no pepper yet, it’ll
burn!) Once you see your oil start to
smoke a teensy bit, gently place the
steak in the pan and let it sizzle.
This is where cooking technique
starts to fall into two distinct camps.
Some say you shouldn’t touch it un-
til it’s had its few minutes on its ﬁrst
side so you won’t disturb the crust,
while others say you should ﬂip it eve-
ry 15-20 seconds to prevent it from
overcooking in the centre. We’ve had
success either way without the crust
or centre being aﬀected, though we
personally prefer ﬂipping every so
often – maybe because we’ve just got
itchy-ﬁed ﬁngers and can’t be still in
the kitchen. It’s your call though.
Now, the part where things com-
monly go tits-up: done-ness. Judging
by the fact that steak thickness/pans/
types will vary, we feel it’s quite hit
and miss to give you times – a 2cm-
thick sirloin needs a diﬀerent cooking
time compared to a 3cm-thick rib eye.
There’s no need to cut into it and risk
ruining your steak though – we sug-
gest either the touch test (takes a while

to get the hang of, even for chefs), or
go all Imperial-geek-style and use a
food probe to check internal tempera-
ture.
The guidelines are as follows:
Bleu (45-49°C): Soft and squishy –
you’ll probably get some blood on your
hands after touching it. A vampire
would be proud.
Rare (49-52°C): Soft to the touch.
Medium rare (52-64°C): Yields gently
when touched. We’re impartial to hav-
ing our steaks done this way.
Medium (57-60°C): Starts to firm up
but still yields slightly.
Medium well (60-65°C): Feels firm.
Well done (>65°C): Hard to touch –
dare we say “like a rock”? Also known
as a bloody waste of good meat.
When you’re done, take the steak
out of the pan and set it aside to rest
– residual heat means it’ll carry on
cooking for a little bit, and it’s impor-
tant that you let it rest for around 5
minutes so that the meat has a chance
to reabsorb its juices. If you cut it fresh
out of the pan you’ll leak said juices
and end up eating thick leather.
And there you have it – steak cooked
simply in this way means you get to
fully enjoy quality meat that hasn’t
had its ﬂavours tampered with unnec-
essary extras.
Simply season a little more with pep-
per and drizzle the cooking and rest-
ing juices over. Serve with potatoes
on the side (we’re big fans of chunky
fries/chips), along with some greens
to knock down the guilt factor of this
sometimes-tricky-to-make treat.
Enjoy your bloody steak this Hal-
loween!
