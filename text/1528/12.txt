FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER
12
Alice Yang enters the magical world of fashion photography
here has long existed a
debate in regards to the
reasons behind fashion
photography. Do photog-
raphers pick up their Has-
selblads solely under the direction of
Devil Wears Prada-esque editors, and
do models pose nonchalantly just to
put the seemingly un-wearable cat-
walk designs to use? Or perhaps it is
just to do with amusement, allowing
some to turn a hobby into a career.
Justiﬁcations for the art, if you will
allow me to refer to it as such, stretch-
es back to the days of the invention of
the camera. In fact, fashion photog-
raphy is a medium which everyone,
whether consciously or not, appreci-
ates. From Burberry’s latest campaign
featuring the adorable Roo Panes to
the well-loved Dior Cherie advert in
which an innocent Natalie Portman
poses in her most natural form – any
advert one comes across related to
the fashion world counts as fashion
photography. And just like celebrated
artists and musicians, there are fa-
mous fashion photographers known
for their skills and expertise, or in Tim
Walker’s case, their ability to create
another world.
Tim Walker’s photography is the
type that leaves one speechless, per-
haps the natural result of having been
thrown into a fairy tale, except that
at his latest exhibition, one awakes
from the dream to discover a real-
ity. Somerset House’s East Wing has
been morphed into a mystical play-
ground of childish tales, in which the
extravagant props used by the pho-
tographer are displayed alongside his
photographs. From life-sized spitﬁres
and swan boats to giant dolls and skel-
etons, the home of London Fashion
Week is showcasing the magician of
fashion photography itself.
Accompanied by ethereal jewellery
box music and the tapping of visitor’s
heels against the exhibition’s wooden
ﬂoors, Tim Walker whisks you away to
the velvet walled room in which you
too can peer out of its windows and
witness the staggering beauty com-
monly drowned out by the grey gloom
of everyday life. It is a view so full of
vivid colour and naïve imagination, of
giant bees playing cellos and humon-
gous snails lounging on beds that leav-
ing the exhibition inspired is beyond
choice.
And for those who crave more, the
exhibition’s accompanying book Tim
Walker: Story Teller is the perfect an-
tidote. But who need drugs in Walk-
er’s world, where ﬂying saucers, race
hounds and picnic tables ﬂoat eﬀort-
lessly in glowing forests? The pages
of this book present snapshots from
within an incredible mind; pages of
Walker’s scrap-book and quotes spi-
ralling out of control. Walker endows
upon us a sugar-coated view of the re-
ality of adulthood in a chaotic mix of
pictures and emotions, with one les-
son for us all: “the lightness of spirit
allows the imagination to soar cloud
high”.
