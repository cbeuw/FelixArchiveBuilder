ith the amount of
buzz surrounding
the Royal Albert
Hall over the last
couple of weeks
or so, both for those graduating and
the outside world, it was almost in-
evitable that the Queen would end
up parachuting into the middle of
graduation while the leaving cohort
shook hands with Daniel Craig. Wait,
sorry, I’m getting a little mixed up
here.
The point I’m trying to make is that
we’ve got a road out in front of Beit
that’s prime for big events and stuﬀ.
And it should be used more often!
Who doesn’t want student accommo-
dation clogged up to the rafters every
other day while some star-studded
event goes on right by Aeronautics?
But what event could drive Imperi-
al students back into Beit for a once-
in-a-lifetime glimpse at the back of a
famous person’s head? What could
possibly match the turnout for James
Bond et al. that Tuesday night’s pro-
ceedings generated? Well that, dear
reader, is where I come in with a few
suggestions.
1) IMPERIAL BASED OLYMPICS
AND PARALYMPICS
I know it’s over, but just imagine Im-
perial 2012. Usain Bolt tackling zebra
crossings on Prince Consort Road,
and even thundering down Exhibi-
tion Road’s unique layout at colossal
speeds. He may just have ﬁnally met
his match. Throw in Wheelchair Bas-
ketball in the RAH, and you’re set.
You could probably even move the
McDonalds in Knightsbridge a little
closer. Maybe by Essentials. Every-
body wins.
2) THE ACADEMY AWARDS
Yep, move the Oscars from America
to the UK for no other reason than
the surge of Hollywood movers and
shakers that descend upon the QTR
to quaﬀ a few glasses of champagne.
The red carpet would probably have

to roll all the way down Queen’s

and/or pizza delivery people trying

3) EUROVISION
Once the United Kingdom reclaims
its rightful position at the top of the
Eurovision Song Contest (i.e. never)
where better a venue is there for ter-
rible euro-hits than the Great Hall?
Jedward would probably be a better
draw than any potential Summer Ball
could ever dream of achieving.
And there we have it, let’s just at least
have a think about bringing some
more big names down to South Ken.

perial should hold in order to rival
