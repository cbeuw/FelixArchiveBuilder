Sir,
Can I suggest that The Hon. George
Howard Esq. considers making clear
the distinction between ‘poor people’
and ‘lazy poor people’ in any future
articles.

Sir,
May I ask why the Union President is
wasting his time on purely masturba-
tory structural reorganisations of the
Union, changes which even he states
“won’t aﬀect anything practical” (p20
in last week’s edition of Felix). Surely
he should concentrate on things which

Sir,
Following a lengthy lycra-clad spin
session in Ethos a few nights back I
was feeling rather ﬂustered so made
my way out to Exhibition Road rath-
er promptly. I struggled – aching and
sweaty – to toss my banana whilst
walking the entire length of the road.
Onlookers seemed worried by my
expression of anger and disappoint-
ment but were relieved to see elation
when the happy ending was eventually
achieved. It begs the question ‘why – on
a street so heavily populated by tour-
ists – are there not more bins?’

Sir,
I’d like to express my disgust at the
revolting communist drivel that you
printed last week. I am appalled that
this paper is printing such baseless
fantastical tripe. The article in ques-
tion is a typical example of the com-
mon mentality of the left – blind to
the reality of today’s society. I can only
hope that few people have been swayed
by this misguided attempt at journal-
ism.

n Friday Andrew Mitch-
ell - the Government’s
chief whip - resigned
after a confronta-
tion with a police-
man that happened over a month
ago, involving a gate, a bike and
(possibly) the word ‘pleb’. It was
all a bit awkward; especially
since the policeman and Mr
Mitchell gave differing accounts.
Someone was lying and since Mr
Mitchell is a politician, chances
are it was he.
The best defence I heard of
the policeman was from Ed-
ith Hall, professor of classics
at King’s College London who
said that ‘pleb’ was “just not
the sort of thing a policeman
would invent”. Not sure
if I would take that
as a complement or
not. Is knowledge of
classical insults some-
thing to brag about?
What amused me
throughout the saga was
the multitude of headlines you
could get out of such a simple case
of idiocy. Search the BBC’s web-
site for “pleb” and you’ll find a huge
list of relevant headlines. Examples
of the most inciteful include:
“Is Pleb an insult?”, “ Who
says ‘pleb’ nowadays?”,
“Andrew Mitch-
ell is ‘toast’ says
Miliband” and
“Alex Salmond
c o n d e m n s
UK govern-
m e n t ’ s
‘ L o r d
Snootys’”. I counted around 30 arti-
cles on the BBC alone written over
the course of a month: a rate of one
a day. All about something that - no
matter your point of view - is largely
irrelevant to everyone. What is there
to say? What could the 24th article
possibly have said that wasn’t cov-
ered in the preceding 23? Why did
these people take it upon themselves
to say exactly the same as someone
else the day before? And that’s just
the BBC. I tried to search the Dai-
ly Mail’s website but my computer
crashed due to an ignorance over-
load.
Don’t get me wrong; no one in
politics has a nice word to say about
Andrew Mitchell. It sounds like he’s
offensive and arrogant, but the at-
tention he has been given is bizarre-
ly overwhelming.
Well it’s over now. He’s resigned.
I’m sure he’ll enjoy a lovely redun-
dancy package and everybody else
can feel rather righteous. But the
real loser is the general public; there
was once a time when if you were
interested in politics and wanted to
make a difference, you ran for of-
fice. Now, you become a journalist
and rant about the people who did.
WWIt’s so very easy to criticise; just
look at me!
I have great respect for (some)
politicians. They have chosen a pro-
fession that offers little in return, for
living away from their families and
being hated by default. If all these
journalists can do a better job, why
don’t they?
O
Gategate and the press
George Butcher gives us his plebian verdict
assumes that there is some preexisting natural entitlement to state
handouts and that it is an absolute duty of the state and of the taxpay-
er to provide them. The only duty of the state is to listen and act upon
the behalf of the majority which elected them - and if that majority
want a reduction in welfare payments, then so be it.

I’m completely opposed to the something-for-nothing culture of
thick-headed public schoolboys granted massive inheritences, social
majority of the country. For most people, beneﬁts are a social safety
net to help the least fortunate - and rightly so. But for the far left it
doesn’t matter how eﬀective the beneﬁts system is at actually provid-
ing a safety net because that’s not what they see it as; to them its an
engine of redistribution.Most people in the country realise there is
more to the debate over beneﬁts than poor people getting a handout
from the middle class, and that it’s a complex issue that needs serious
solutions. The left however *do* see it as a handout - just one they
approve of.
