FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER
Entrepreneurs ‘hail’ new app
Imperial Entrepreneurs meet the founders of the Hailo app
ast Monday, Imperial
Entrepreneurs invited the
people behind Hailo –
The Black Cab App, to
its weekly event, Startup
Mondays. Russell Hall, one of the co-
founders of Hailo spoke to us about
their success story and what makes
Hailo so popular, to a point that even
celebrities and serial entrepreneurs
such as James Caan are tweeting about
its brilliance! Russell explained how
getting Hailo to where it is today was
not easy, nor was it a smooth sailing
process. They had to get rid of a tech
team that were not delivering and had
to pitch their ideas to and convince
numerous investors that their app was
going to work. They had tremendous
belief and conﬁdence in their idea and
strived to make it a success.
Hailo is a rapidly expanding mobile
app that enables you to hail a black
cab through your smartphone and pay
for it via credit or debit card, or cash
with no extra charges or booking fees.
A brilliant yet simple idea, that brings
more business to London taxi drivers
and eliminates the need for passen-
gers to frantically hail taxis!
The app was envisioned by three
London taxi drivers, Russell, Terry
and Gary as well as three Internet en-
trepreneurs. They managed to raise
$20 million from various investors and
backers including Niklas Zennström,
the co-founder of Skype. Other inves-
tors include Accel Partners and Wel-
lington Partners, who have funded
high proﬁle companies such as Face-
book and Spotify. You know you have
something good if such people are
backing your product.
Having initially been introduced in
London, the app has now made its way
to Dublin, Toronto and most recently
Boston with plans to expand stateside
in Chicago and New York. The app is
tailored to a certain city based on its
regulations and people in order to en-
joy the most success. In London itself,
20 per cent of the black cab drivers are
registered with Hailo, a ﬁgure that is
likely to grow.
The key to this success has been the
fact that they place the same amount
of care and emphasis on their drivers
as they do on their customers. They
have a great communication system
to help drivers understand and use the
app and also listen to their feedback
to constantly adapt, change and solve
problems that may arise. Taxi driv-
ers are drawn to Hailo because of the
great driver experience that they ﬁnd
to be more sociable and proﬁtable.
Besides this, the app has also been
designed and developed by leading
designers formerly working at com-
panies such as Google. It even has a
feature that allows passengers to rate
their drivers ensuring the best service
is always provided.
What attracts the customers to the
app is its simplicity and ease of use;
you are never more than two taps
away from getting a taxi. It eliminates
the need to carry cash around for
taxis. As Russell explained, when you
have no cash in hand, you either can-
not take a taxi or are forced to go to an
ATM to withdraw. Hailo prevents this
and makes everyday activities such
as shopping much easier. Hailo also
prides itself on the fact that it charges
the customer only the taxi fare, and
this gives them a major ad-
vantage over competitors
such as Addison Lee,
where booking
fees ap-
ply.
Hailo
has re-
ceived
e x -
t r e m e l y
positive reviews from app users, with
an average 5 star rating from over 1000
reviews. With such great features and
excellent feedback from customers
who use the app there is no saying
how far this app will go and how big
it will become. Future plans include
introducing the app Far East in Tokyo,
where the taxi business is massive and
so is the use of technology and smart-
phones. It is certainly exciting times
for those at Hailo.
For those of you who
are uncertain
as to what
S t a r t u p
Mondays
are, they
are a se-
ries of
weekly
s o c i a l s
h o s t e d
by Impe-
rial Entrepreneurs, in which entrepre-
neurs are invited to give talks about
their companies to students. The at-
tendees have the opportunity to hear
how businesses such as Hailo, were
set up, organised and run to become
a widely downloaded and used appli-
cation. Those in attendance are also
given a chance to further socialise
and network with the entrepreneurs
behind London’s hottest startups at
the Eastside Bar. With Hailo, we were
lucky enough to have the drinks spon-
sored by our speakers. We can’t always
guarantee that though!
Imperial Entrepreneurs’ next Start-
up Monday event on the 29th of Octo-
ber will involve Hayley Quinn, a dat-
ing coach, who will give advice on how
to be more conﬁdent and memorable
when meeting people in diﬀerent
places such as at networking events. If
the Hailo event was anything to go by,
this one is guaranteed to be a success!
