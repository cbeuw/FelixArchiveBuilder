I saw a guy who looked like Jimmy
Savile on the Bakerloo line the other
day.

No, but he definitely looked like he
was thinking about it.

Internshit
Despite being stuck in this
job for over two months
now, last Friday was the
ﬁrst time I could bring
myself to face my co-
workers outside of the
oﬃce environment. I know that
everyone gets particularly chirpy
at the end of the week, and I ﬁg-
ured that this is because everyone
gets to spend two days away from
places and people that they hate:
the concept of bleeding into the
weekend with them seemed a little
dumb to me.
Regardless, I found myself zip-
ping along the humid tube, still
suited and booted, agitated at the
tourist stood beside me grazing on
an odious cheese and onion pasty.
We were on our way to Soho to ex-
plore some of its wonderful drink-
ing establishments, before winding
up in some god-awful club with
other teams just like ours. Thank-
fully I’d managed to bash one out
before clocking oﬀ – there was no
way I was going to risk cranking
my beer goggles up to 10 in the
company of the disgusting Sheila
without doing so ﬁrst. With empty
balls I’d be able to stay grounded
and see her for what she really is.
We arrived at the restaurant –
sub-par Japanese far served by an
irritating man in a funny hat – and,
of course, I ended up seated next to
Harry. At the “meet ‘n’ greet” be-
fore joining, when graduates were
describing the cost of rent in Lon-
don, Harry ones squawked “£550 a
WEEK?” No, fucktard, not week,
year: why don’t you engage your
fucking brain and think about it
for a second. Apparently Market-
ing is one of the few programmes
one can enter with a 2.2. Through-
out the meal I take full advantage
of the credit cards, quaﬃng Cris-
tal and disappearing to do more
lines, anything to avoid conversa-
tion. Harry won’t shut up about
how useless he is with chopsticks
and something about how raw ﬁsh
gives him the “jitters”.
When we eventually make it to
the club I have to say I’m a little
disappointed. It’s not that I don’t
like Amikahikibargovidawhites –
it’s just I can’t fucking stand those
places. Overly dolled-up women
who will squat on anything for a
cheeky line and a glossy handbag,
the utterly repugnant toad-of-a-
man and his parade of oligarchs
stood in the corner, and a dread-
ful soundtrack that I’d trade in for
some sounds of JLS any night of
the week. But I was
there, with nothing
but my charming col-
leagues and enough
cigarettes and blow
to see me through a
couple of hours.
During one of
my many outings
to the smoking area
I stumbled across a
cute blonde called
Liz. She assured me
that this wasn’t usu-
ally her scene, and that actually
she couldn’t stand the people. This
would have been more believable
had she not been so ﬁdgety, con-
stantly hinting at a need for drugs.
We disappear to the restroom
and reappear minutes later ﬁlled
with glee, and sit down at my col-
leagues’ table to plan the rest of
our evening. It’s at this point Shei-
la, my manager, tumbles over, hor-
rible meaty ﬂesh sticking out from
all edges, and a crusted patch of
teriyaki sauce glued to her face.
Pushing 40 and still hopping into
bed alone, she thinks that inter-
rupting my interesting conversa-
tion and grabbing at my cock will
improve her life prospects. In-
stead, the combination of the teri-
yaki patch, her rancid Marlboro-
stained tongue, and the general
horror of the situation all begin
to crescendo, as I feel hot, acidic
liquid climbing my oesophagus.
At this point I knew I had to make
a decision: cute blonde for one
night only, or a job to keep a roof
over my head for the next year. I
turned to Liz and projected my
sick in her general direction. It
sloshed all over her neck, and
she sat there looking stunned.
Call me Mr Squander. As a con-
solation prize I give her what’s
left of my powder, and order a
cab home. I’m thinking next week,
and for the rest of the year, I’ll give
the drinks a miss. I’d rather just
sit in and have a Pot Noodle and
a wank.
FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER

Missing man foolishly ventured off IKEA path
A police investigation into the disap-
pearance of William Claydon, 34, has
revealed that he vanished after ventur-
ing oﬀ the designated IKEA pathway
in the Croyden branch of the Swedish
conglomerate. Claydon, who last seen
browsing a modern yet aﬀordable sofa,
wandered oﬀ to look at exhibit kitchen
and was never heard from again. A po-
lice spokesman reiterated the dangers
of a trip IKEA, “If you absolutely must
ﬁnd household goods at low prices
then we implore you to stick to the
marked out trail that is there for your
own safety” before adding “most peo-
ple don’t read Swedish, but if they did,
they’d know that all those signs with
words such as ‘Lyksele’
, ‘Dvala’ and
‘Standig” are not imaginative and fun
Swedish names for otherwise dreary
household items, but signs warning of
dangerous Norse mythical creatures”.
The police went on to state that they
would be releasing pamphlets detailing
the importance of staying on the set
track as well as a list of old Norse gods
they could pray to or make a pact with
in exchange for keeping them safe from
the blood-thirsty and vicious creatures
hidden within the latest range of ward-
robes. Ikea released a statement saying
that whilst they were trying to tackle
the problem by issuing maps upon en-
trance and regular warning announce-
ments inside, they were unlikely to ever
fully rid themselves of the problem as
they had made a pact with Loki which
let him do what he wanted so long as
the company continued to have high-
proﬁle, international success.
