MICROSOFT SPECIAL
Stephen Ingram tells us his thoughts of Microsoft’s latest OS
ith the next ver-
sion of Win-
dows, 8, Micro-
soft are going
c o m p l e t e l y
overhaul the interface, with many
people wondering whether ‘the aver-
age user’ will be able to adjust to the
change (search ‘Dad tries Windows
8’ on YouTube for some examples).
The main change implemented is
that the traditional desktop is now
merely an app inside another inter-
face called ‘Modern UI’ (formerly
known as “Metro”, but following a
trademark dispute with German
Metro AG, Microsoft dropped the
name). It’s the same user interface
and graphical toolkit currently used
by Windows Phone 7 (and soon 8)
devices. This is an attempt to unify
the ‘face of Windows’ across desk-
top, mobile, and tablet.
Having tried the Windows 8 re-
lease preview on a dusty old tower
at home, I found that, while it is no-
where near as eﬃcient at doing cer-
tain tasks as Windows XP or many
Linux distributions, many of my
concerns about using a jack-of-all-
trades interface were unfounded.
Productivity
Anyone who has attempted to en-
gage in serious oﬃce or design work
on a smartphone or tablet would
agree that such devices are not de-
signed with this in mind, and it is
often said that they are purely con-
sumption devices (although the term
consumption in the context of soft-
ware is somewhat erroneous, since
digital media are not consumed
when you watch/listen to/play them,
but the sentiment is still mostly ac-
curate). The main reasons for this
are the form factor (but using Win-
dows 8 on a desktop renders this ir-
relevant, and Microsoft seems to be
keen for its tablets to have Bluetooth
keyboards) and lack of simultane-
ous multitasking. The latter problem
is addressed somewhat as you can
use multiple apps at once via a split
screen eﬀect, although it seems that
outside of what’s on the screen all
other tasks are frozen.
File Management
However, another, more integral
problem hampers work on mobile
operating systems: most informa-
tion you experience is not compara-
ble to a ﬁle in the desktop OS sense.
While you can get ﬁle manager apps
for mobile devices, the issue is that
when any two apps need to share in-
formation, it must be done through
interoperability between the apps,
built from the ground up, rather
than simply integrating with the
ﬁles saved on the device. This leads
to either bloated (resource hog)
apps that try to reinvent the wheel,
or apps that are specialised yet can
hardly function outside of a small set
of tasks.

these problems, as it retains the
traditional ﬁle explorer that can be
run in the desktop mode, which all
applications seem to interface with.
Obviously, we will have to wait and
see the extent to which third party
apps keep this up, but it seems un-
likely developers would go out of the
way to give themselves more work in
this way.
Accessibility
Over the summer I volunteered in a
library providing tech support, often
to older people with little experience
of the motifs of desktop computing.
One of their main sources of confu-
sion, and I would imagine anyone
who has helped technophobes would
agree, was what, precisely, an appli-
cation is. The idea of a program that
is separate from a) the operating sys-
tem it runs on, b) the window that
contains it, and c) the content that
is produced/relayed through it is an
extremely diﬃcult concept to under-
stand.
In light of this, I found it odd that so
many of us buy smartphones (51%
of brits now own them), devices
whose entire selling point (‘there’s
an app for that!’) seems to be this
concept. In my opinion, this is be-
cause apps are not applications for
the computer in the original sense
but another product that owning
the device allows you to buy, often
from the device vendor themselves.
This is a much easier concept to get
your head around and a very simple
way to monetise a mobile operat-
ing system. Some examples of this
include the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7
tablets, which almost certainly sell at
a loss, but whose proﬁts are made up
by subscription services oﬀered by
Google and Amazon.
The reason that I mention this is that
Microsoft fortunately does not seem
to be going down this route with
Windows 8. The model that they are
pushing to sell their own software
puts more emphasis on useful work
and not on providing every aspect
of your life and entertainment, like
Apple or Google. This is fortunate
because such software services tend
to collect your personal information
and provide their media under very
restrictive Digital Rights Manage-
ment.
Interface Consistency
This has been written about in some
detail on the website osnews.com
but I think it is relevant to Windows
8 and quite prescient considering
how just about every OS is altering
its user experience to become more
‘mobile-like’.
When you’re using an app on a
smartphone, the percentage of the
screen taken up by the OS is almost
always smaller than on a desktop,
and you hardly ever see more than
one app open on the screen at the
same time. As a result, many apps
can sacriﬁce ﬁtting in visually in a
way that desktop applications can-
not (the number of android apps that
completely follow Google’s ‘Holo’
guidelines is surprisingly small).
I can’t talk about how easy the
graphical toolkit is to develop for,
but, with Windows Phone 7, Micro-
soft are extremely strict about which
applications are let into its market-
places, and hopefully this will help
alleviate the issue of visual inconsist-
ency in Windows 8 (and some other
causes such as simply porting an iOS
application or coding your app in
HTML).
Conclusion
I have absolutely no doubt that
many people will find Windows 8
much harder to use and to get used
to using than previous versions. I
have every doubt that it will lead
computing in a more efficient and
interconnected direction, but to
my surprise, many of the practi-
cal issues the tech community (and
myself) have with using a mobile
interface on a non-mobile device
seem to have been addressed. Es-
sentially, Microsoft has converged
two paradigms in such a way that
the end product is inefficient on
either device and will almost defi-
nitely ostracise large portions of its
user base. But it’s done it in style.
A pretty edgy and cool logo for such a traditionally bland company - the only thing more creative would be something like a picture of an apple, with one bite taken out of it and using Myriad font.
