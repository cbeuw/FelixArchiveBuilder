FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER
ears of Bondage
3. Daniel Craig
Craig went through a lot of harsh criticism after his name was announced to take over
the franchise. “Boring” was one of the words he was called, and his blonde hair was also
a subject of much scrutiny. Dame Judi Dench (M) came to his defense, giving him her
seal of approval. Then came November 2006, when Craig proved his critics wrong with
the excellent Casino Royale. It was a franchise reboot, injecting a lot more brooding, and
much needed serious energy into a series of films that was getting sillier and sillier.
4. Timothy Dalton
Probably the most similar in nature to what the books, and therefore Ian Fleming,
originally intended, Dalton was the first to step in to put a fresh new spin on the series
after Moore turned it into a farce with his geriatric behaviour towards the end of his run.
Dalton himself only lasted for two films, as we suspect the audience back then wasn’t
ready for such a radical, serious, blood-splattering (his second film is still the highest age-
restricted Bond film), which is a shame.
nbeatable. And as a celebration of your everlasting manhood, we rank the films, and the actors
14. Die Another Day
(2002)
Silly in its plot and
execution, Brosnan’s
goes to North Korea,
piling up one ridiculous
idea after another (an
invisible car makes an
appearance). Halle
Berry’s savvy Jinx as well
as Rosamund Pike’s icy
Miranda Frost are great
additions to the cast.
13. For Your Eyes Only
(1981)
Without a doubt boasts
the best theme song,
but the film itself is
distinctly average,
although the crossbow-
wielding Bond Girl
(Carole Bouquet) who
does something useful
other than shag the
womanising spy is a
highlight.
12. Licence to Kill
(1989)
This was slapped on
with the highest ageing
restriction for a Bond
film due to its violent
nature. Timothy Dalton
comes off better in his
second/last appearance
as Bond, and Benicio
Del Toro’s knife-
throwing villain side-
kick is badass.
11. The Spy Who Loved
Me (1977)
Will forever be
remembered as the
film that gave us Jaws,
a hugely entertaining
villain of epic size who
could have easily ripped
Moore into tiny little
pieces. Plus Bond meets
his match in the deadly
Anya Amasova, the
titular “spy.”
10. The Man with the
Golden Gun (1974)
The Golden Gun is by
far the coolest, most
memorable gadget to
come out of the Bond
series–agunsostylishly
disguised as a cigarette
holder, lighter, and pen,
all painted in gold. Bond
getting owned by a
villain one-third his size
is also a great watch.
9. Goldeneye (1995)
Pierce Brosnan’s Bond
debut got off to a flying
start thanks to his
effortless charm and
sly humour. This is also
notable for having a
female character who
seems to love rough sex
morethanBondhimself:
the infamous Xenia
Onatopp (the hilarious
Famke Janssen).
8. Thunderball (1965)
Set in the crystal clear
blue waters of the
Bahamas,thisispossibly
the best-looking Bond
film out there, both in
termsofthemagnificent
scenery and the many,
many women Bond gets
surrounded with. This is
also famous for its epic
underwater fighting
sequence.
7. Tomorrow Never
Dies (1997)
It’s incredibly rare to
see a Bond Girl fend
for herself but Chinese
spy Wai Lin (Michelle
Yeoh) is a highly skilled
martial artist. And Teri
Hatcher has a heck of
a good slap, marking a
thoroughly deserving
palm print on the side of
Brosnan’s face.
