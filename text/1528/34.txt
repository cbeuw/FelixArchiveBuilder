Arthur Charles Clarke
Maciej Matuszewski talks about one of his favourite authors
t’s no secret that Arthur C
Clarke is one of my favourite
authors of all time. Born in
1917 he is often considered,
alongside Isaac Asimov and
Robert Heinlein, as one of the Big
Three authors of Golden Age science
ﬁction.
He had a brilliant imagination yet
always constrained himself to the
realms of the scientiﬁcally possible.
He used his lifelong interest in science
and technology (he served in World
War Two as a radar specialist and later
obtained a degree in mathematics and
physics from King’s College London)
to paint a vision of the future that even
now often remains wonderfully plau-
sible. As a result his work is often be-
loved by scientists and engineers.
As with many of his contemporar-
ies, his work has often been criticised
for its poor characterisation. While
this is indeed a problem in some of
his novels, most notably in The City
and the Stars, the fact is that in most
of his work the focus is not necessar-
ily meant to be the individual charac-
ters but rather how humanity adapts
to new technologies and unforeseen
situations that the future may bring.
There is a wonderful optimism in
Clarke’s work that, by coming togeth-
er, humanity will eventually prevail
— whether in the face of disaster, as
in The Songs of Distant Earth, or sim-
ply the unexpected, as in Rendezvous
with Rama. This is an outlook some-
what reminiscent of that of Gene Ro-
denberry, though Clarke did seem to
be somewhat less naïve in his views of
the future than the Star Trek creator.
There are no easy utopias in Clarke’s
work — just an attitude that, though
we will make mistakes from time to
time, we will probably make it through
in the end.
Clarke’s writing style is somewhat
old fashioned and certainly not for
everyone. It’s not the sort of thing that
I would want to read every day, but I
do believe that it is good writing and
can serve as some, for lack of a better
phrase, ‘light relief’ from the grittier
and more conﬂict driven ﬁction popu-
lar today.
One also cannot forget Clarke’s con-
tribution to the popularisation of sci-
ence. Not only did his ﬁction inspire
generations of scientists and engi-
neers, he also wrote numerous non-
ﬁction books and essays exploring the
possible applications of new technolo-
gies. He was the ﬁrst to suggest using
geostationary satellites for commu-
nication and popularised Konstantin
Tsiolkovsky’s ideas for a space eleva-
tor. Arthur C Clarke died on March 19
2008 and he will certainly be remem-
bered for many years to come.

In the 160 years since its ﬁrst publi-
cation, Moby Dick has become one
of the most acclaimed novels in the
English language. However, while
most people have heard of the book
and its most famous characters, few
have actually read it. Now, however,
artist Angela Cockayne and writer
Philip Hoare, both big fans of Moby
Dick, seek to correct this problem and
give people a chance to experience
this masterpiece in a new and excit-
ing way.
Their Moby Dick Big Read project,
which started on the September 16
and runs till the end of January, each
day releases an audio clip of one of
the book’s 135 chapters — each read
by a diﬀerent, well known individual.
Readers have already included Tilda
Swinton, David Cameron and Ste-
phen Fry. They are set to be joined
in the coming months by the likes of
Benedict Cumberbatch and Sir David
Attenborough. Each reading is also
accompanied by an image, inspired
by the novel, created by a renowned
artist.
The project’s creators say that they
were inspired by the novel’s continu-
ing relevance. They say: “Moby Dick is
the great American novel. … Sprawl-
ing, magniﬁcent, deliriously digres-
sive, it stands over and above all other
works of ﬁction. … Now, in the 21st
Century, a century and a half since it
was ﬁrst conceived and launched onto
a misbelieving world, Moby-Dick re-
tains its power – precisely because
we are still coming to terms with it,
and what it said. Incredibly prophet-
ic, it foresaw so many of the aspects
of the modern world which we deal
with. The abuse of power and belief;
of nature and the environment; of the
human spirit. It deals with art and ar-
tiﬁce and stark reality – in an almost
existential manner. It is truly a book
before its time – almost ancient myth,
as much as futuristic prophesy.”
All the chapters that have been re-
leased so far may be downloaded for
free from mobydickbigread.com.
