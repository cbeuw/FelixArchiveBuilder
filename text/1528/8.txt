FRIDAY 26 OCTOBER
8
rom 15 – 17th February
2013, you will see numer-
ous important looking
people in black suits and
formal dresses run around
our campus. And you may wonder
what it could be causing this invasion
of foreigners. Let me give you some
insight into the big things happening
at Imperial.
The very large university level Mod-
el United Nations (MUN) conference
will be hosted at Imperial College in
February 2013. For three days, del-
egates from universities from all
around the UK and abroad will debate
pressing international issues on the
UN agenda, representing their “home
country”, which they may have never
lived in. but whose politics they have
extensively researched during the last
weeks. So what exactly is MUN? It is
a gathering of some of the best and
brightest debaters, speakers and in-
spirational ﬁgures in the global stu-
dent community who swap identity
for 3 days stepping in the footsteps of/
taking on the role of national repre-
sentatives to the UN. It is astonishing
how realistic these simulated UN con-
ferences often turn out to be, portray-
ing the complexities of international
policy formation (change). After an
MUN weekend full of drafting resolu-
tions, sending secret notes to the col-
laborators you managed to convince
the night before in the hotel lounge to
join your policy just before going for
the International Party Night, lengthy
voting procedures, little sleep (due to
drafting papers or dazzling parties?)
and making new lifelong friendships
with people from all around the world,
you feel more than overwhelmed.
If you have done it once, you want
to do it again. How United Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
puts it, MUN is an “ex-
ercise that gives
you a full taste of
the complexity
of internation-
al relations
– the intri-
cacies of ne-
gotiating
a m o n g
d i v e r s e

The conference will be better attended than this...
LIMUN comes to Imperial
Franca Hoffmann discusses politicians-to-be coming to campus
lenges of achieving consensus, the pa-
tience required to win progress”.
Like is the case with so many other
social phenomena, Model United Na-
tions started growing exponentially
the moment it attracted the student
community. With more than 1500
delegates, 25 committees negotiat-
ing in 3 diﬀerent languages, the Lon-
don International Model United Na-
tions Conference (LIMUN) 2013 has
grown into the biggest university level
MUN conference in Europe, The oﬃ-
cial launch of LIMUN 2013, held on
Thursday, Oct 18th at HULT Interna-
tional Business School, was attended
by representatives of several higher
education institutions in London,
the British UN Association as well as
various MUN societies from around
the UK and abroad. The presentation
of the LIMUN 2013 secretariat was
followed by a food and drink recep-
tion, with the beer sponsored by the
Embassies of Dominican Republic,
Trinidad and Tobago.
Amanda Sun, Under-Secretary-
General for Logistics, heading a team
of volunteers to organise the neces-
sary provisions for the conference, ex-
plains what is special about LIMUN
2013:
“This year the topic of the confer-
ence will be the Millennium Devel-
opment Goals. We want to bring a
focus to what we as a conference are
trying to raise awareness on, and the
MDGs address the most pressing is-
sues facing our world today.” These
are undoubtedly
big problems
that politicians
and govern-
ments around
the world wor-
ry about, but
what does Impe-
rial has to do
w i t h
F
MUN?
Philippe Rival, President of the
Imperial College MUN society (IC-
MUN) tells us that LIMUN and IC-
MUN have enjoyed a very tight re-
lationship for many years. “We are
amongst the biggest delegations who
attend LIMUN. We have also sent a
minimum of one delegate per year to
chair and very often our delegates win
several awards across a wide variety of
committees.”
Now, if you say ‘Well, this sounds
all amazing, but I am an engineer,
how should I survive in the middle
of all these politicians and lawyers?’
Needless to say that as a scientist at-
tending an MUN conference, you are
something special. When asked about
your subject, people tend to look at
you with this glint of surprise think-
ing ‘What the hell is he doing here?’.
And yes, why on earth should scien-
tists be interested in MUN? This is
one of Philippe’s favourite questions.
“I can make it even simpler : Why do
we do MUN at Imperial ? We don’t
have student in PPE, literature,
law or psychology. The best way
to fully understand why it is that
MUN works at Imperial has to do
with what being a scientist actually
entails. Scientists, engineers, doctors,
all share the common trait that their
work revolves around ﬁnding a solu-
tion to a problem by using knowledge
and reasoning they have accumulated
over experience and training. People
from Imperial know what it means
to go and ﬁnd an answer to a prob-
lem, and they even go to such lengths
as giving up their night and sleep on
such problems.”
Conferences are an unforgettable
experience, and if you feel you are
not the next Churchill to come, don’t
worry, everybody had their ﬁrst MUN
experience one day. Amanda recalls
how she ﬁrst got involved with the
worldwide MUN movement. “Some-
times things happen when you least
expect them - my high school team
needed a member, at the last minute,
to replace one who could not attend
Harvard MUN in Boston and my best
friend pulled me in. It turned out to
be the best split-second decision I’d
ever made, leading me to where I am
today.”
Our very own ICMUN president
Philippe Rival ﬁrst started MUN in
high-school when he moved back to
France from Australia, but what in-
spired his ﬁrst true MUN experience
happened at the Paris Conference
of 2010. Philippe was representing
Uganda and won the Best Delegate
Award. This particular conference was
held in the actual building of the UN-
ESCO, in Paris. He received his Award
in front of 2000 people and 195 state
ﬂags, on the UNESCO stage, in front
of a handful of actual UN representa-
tives. “There is nothing more motivat-
ing than to get that feeling ﬁrst hand.”
Amanda adds that she was blown
away by how passionate LIMUN dele-
gates are, and by their depth of knowl-
edge in global and regional issues.
Besides an excellent opportunity to
build relationships across borders of
background, culture and nationality,
and inevitably – let’s be realistic – a lot
of work, there is a very important life
skill to learn: when you play with the
rules, you come up with better ways to
manipulate or go around them.
If you are interested in being part of
something great, applications for LI-
MUN 2013 are still open.
A last word from the ICMUN presi-
dent: “One thing is sure, the MUN fu-
ture is bright at Imperial.”
