This week you make eye-con-
tact with a complete stranger
on the tube. A roaring shud-
dering noise overtakes the
carriage as the seats sponta-
neously combust and the air
fills with an acrid, poisonous
gas. Damnit girl! We warned
you about making eye-con-
tact with strangers on the
tube.
This week you try to shake
off the nation’s blues by com-
ing up with a witty joke about
Jimmy Savile. You remember
that such a horrific story will
never be funny and we live in
an unbearably awful world.
You numbly play Empire To-
tal War for 6 hours and cry
weakly onto your boyfriend’s
shoulder as he sleeps.
This week you decide to bring
scrunchies back. They were re-
ally cool in primary school and
frankly they deserve a return.
Unfortunately you’re a fat man
with a lanky pony tail and a
neck beard so instead of bring
it back; you actually get a mo-
tion passed by the EU commis-
sion declaring scrunchies ille-
gal in member states. Gutted.
This week Endnote crashes
AGAIN while you’re writing a
report, wiping out all references
in your document. In a fit of fury
you throw your computer out of
the window of the 5th floor of the
library, killing the Rector pass-
ing by beneath. Due to a never-
used part of the College charter,
you’re declared the new rector.
Still get 45% on your report.
This week you’re bored queu-
ing in the JCR to buy your pan-
nini. You decide to fake having
post-traumatic stress disorder.
Lying on the floor screaming,
you realise that no one is pay-
ing attention to you. Disap-
pointed, you stand up only to
find that your legs don’t work.
Your consciousness snaps
back to in a minefield in Sudan.
This week you wake up on Sat-
urday remembering telling some
girl in metric that you wrote the
horoscopes for Felix in a feeble
attempt to impress her. She
said to write something good
for Virgo this week. You decide
instead to use the horoscope to
apologise that the evening got a
bit weird towards the end, and
for forgetting her name.
This week, you decide that Im-
perial is not for you and you’d
rather just have a baby and
live off benefits. You purchase
some artificial sperm from the
Internet and become pregnant.
However, when the child is born
it is a monstrous bird-human
hybrid: turns out you purchased
genetically engineered avian
sperm. Enjoy breast-feeding!
This week, you graduate.
You walk up onto the stage
and decide to remember it
as the proudest moment of
your life. However, as you
shake the rector’s hand, you
queef loudly. You are morti-
fied but the rector smiles re-
assuringly and asks if you’d
like to join the Queef O’Nions
club.
This week you have a network-
ing event with the prestigious
company Bullshit Consulting.
You were told there would be a
lotofarse-lickinginvolvedsoim-
mediately whip down the CEO’s
trousers and go straight for the
bum cheeks, then insert your
tongue into his anus for good
measure. You are immediately
offered a job, congratulations!
This week you decide to try
to sneak into the Skyfall pre-
miere. You firstly try offering
oral sex and money to the
bouncers. When that doesn’t
work you use the underground
tunnels under Imperial but get
lost and end up dying, disori-
entated, starving and alone
three days later as no-one no-
ticed you’d disappeared.
This week you go out for a
meal with someone you’ve
fancied for ages. It all goes
really well and you invite her
back ‘for drinks’ ;p. However,
on the walk home, you have
a sudden urge to poo. You try
to hold it in but you shit your-
self all over your new chinos.
You shouldn’t have chosen
the curry.
This week you contract an STI
from the 4th year computing
guy you slept with when you’d
lost your glasses. You confront
him about it and he explains
that it is a virus he caught from
his computer after spending
too much time surfing un-
protected on the Internet. He
prescribes you a firewall and
shuffles back to his basement.
