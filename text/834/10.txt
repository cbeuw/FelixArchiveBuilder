Nestle kills
babies!
1C Third World First is participating
in the Nestle Boycott campaign
which was relaunched this March.
This article explains why.
Four vears after the end of the last
Nestle boycott, D r Raj Anand, a
paediatrician from Bombay told a
press conference in Washington
'Bottle feeding is killing babies...say
no to Nestle.'
The initial campaign started in
1977 following worldwide exposure
of the devastating effects of baby
milk promotion. Illiteracy, lack of
hygienic conditions, clean water and
fuel for sterilisation combined with
poverty and made bottle feeding
lethal. Despite this, baby milk
companies c o n t i n u e d to use
aggressive marketing techniques to
make a killing. Massive advertising,
sales reps dressed as nurses,
sponsored babv shows and free
samples all contributed to a decline
in breast feeding and rise in infant
illness. James Grant, director of
U N I C E F , estimates these practices
caused a million extra deaths
worldwide each year.
This campaign forced Nestle to
sign an agreement with protestors
and the boycott was lifted. But today
Nestle are u p to the same dirty
tricks. Nestle continues to dump
babv milk supplies on hospitals in
over 20 countries, particularly Africa
and Asia, in direct violation of the
W o r l d Health O r g a n i s a t i o n
International Code of Marketing
Breast Milk Substitutes, adopted in
1981. These supplies inevitably get
distributed a n d impede breast
feeding. "Free samples are not
charity, they are a marketing ploy
to increase'profits: breast feeding
stops so the mothere have to buy
Nestles milk.
To make the boycott most
effective cut out Nescafe.
Other Nestle products include:
Rowntree M a c k i n t o s h , Polo.
Nescafe, Blend 37, Nesquick, Cello,
Ideal, Fulcreem Custard, Elevenses,
Sarsons Vinegar, Chambourcy,
•Darkly, Le G r a n d e , C h a m b y ,
Nouvelle, Robot, Jacky, Fox's Mints,
Milo, Mix-o-Choc, Superquick, Flo-
lite, Fine Blend, Findus, Eskimo,
Lean Cuisine, Hippopota, Bonjour,
Flamby, Fromage Frais, Creme
Vienna, Kremby, Sun-Pat, Kit Kat,
Animal Bar, Milkmaid, Flo-Mix,
Karima, Maggi, Libby, C Drinks,
Moonshine, Carnation, Coffee-
Mate, Slender, Build U p , Go-Cat
and Dog, Gales, Buitoni, Original
Cookie Co., Caro Coffee Substit.,
Tip Top, Ashbourne Water, Alta
Rica, Crosse & Blackwell, Waistline,
Branston, B«nne Cuisine, Cook in
the Pot, Rice & Things, 4 Seasons,
Pasta Choice, Dish of the Day.
As a far better alternative to
Nescafe, try Oxfam's Nicaraguan
Coffee, the profits of which go to the
people and not to Western owned
companies that exploit Third World
workers. Nicaragua has suffered
greatly because of its debts and the
US trade embargo, and Coffee
pickers have often been the victims
of attacks by the US aided Contras.
(Traidcraft also sell non-exploitative
coffee and teas.)

I am prepared to sell Traidcraft
and Oxfam's teas and coffees on a
strictly non-profit basis. Filter or de-
caff coffee is available. Tea is
available in loose packets or 120 one
or two cup bags.
SCOUT & GUIDE
Calling all
outdoor types
Scout and Guide, being generally
all-round people, decided it would
be a jolly nice idea to go to Scotland
during the Easter hols just gone
(alas!). It was therefore decided that
Glen Shiel would be the place to go
and do our all-round outdoor type
of thing. However, somewhere
along the way, someone decided it
would be a terrific idea if we were
to set off early in the morning to
travel during the day. So, there I
was, stood outside Beit Arch at 7am
on a Saturday morning wondering
where the hell I had left my brain.
Those ever-so-luxurious union vans
needed to be packed, and then the
people somehow crammed i n o n
top (why is it that the people come
last?). Then guess what? The bane of
every club trying to get away on
time, the people who turn up late.
Now we had one guy who was
coming all the way from Germany
just to go away with us, you think
he would have had the decency to
turn up on time wouldn't you? He
did finally arrive of course, not too
late in the end, and off we set. One
van was to go up the old M1/M6 (ie
the obvious route) and the other one
was to go up the East cost route.
Why? Because one of our number
had left his kag at a friends house
in Ripon, of course, it's quite simple
really! Also we were due to pick up
some 12 year-old i n Durham, a
younger verson of one of our
number no less.
Well to cut a long (oh! so very
long) story short, we eventually
arrived at our humble abode in the
Highlands at around 10pm. By the
way, thanks very much to Louise
and to Mike and Rupert's mum for
p r o v i d i n g m u c h needed
refreshments along the way! For
those of vou who aren't quite sure
of where Glen Shief is, take out a
map of Scotland, find Skve and then
move your finger down and to the
right a bit. The aforementioned
'humble abode' bv the way, was a
3-storey shooting lodge on the shore
of a verv beautiful lock. This meant
of course that we had real beds to
sleep in for a change, and that our
meals were served onto a real table
in a real dining room! The plastic
bowls and mugs which we use did
seem rather incongruous, but as
most people are simply interested in
stuffing their faces then trying to
steal somebody else's as well,
nobody complained.
Glen Shiel offers an enormous
variety of things to do, so long as it
involves walking or scrambling up
mountains! There are the Brothers
and Sisters; the Saddle and friends
which can be reached by a great
scramble; the South Glen Shief
Ridge with its seven Munros and
many other variations and routes
taking in various combinations of
these. All of these, and others, were
attempted by members of the
group, and a great time was had by
all. To be precise, two Swedish
guys, the bloke who now lives in
Germany, plus numerous other
stragglers from all reaches of the
UK.
The only problem that some of us
had all week was sunburn! Yes, you
can forget the M e d . just pop up to
Bonnie Scotland and be very, very
lucky. We went during the last week
of the hols, so there was reasonably
fresh snow on the tops of the
mountains. We also happened to hit
a sunny patch in the weather, so
walking along the tops was a really
dazzling business! Walking over
virgin snow in bright sunshine is
really rather strange, because your
eyes have a hell of a job trying to
focus on something. You have to
look at the end of your boots or at
some distant piece of rock otherwise
you are likely to fall flat on your face
because your balance goes! The
snow did, though, provide ample
opportunity for sledging or sliding
around and generally playing silly
buggers. One particular decent from
a mountain simply involved putting
on waterproof trousers and sitting
down—gravity did the rest!
As for the rest of this term,
nothing too strenuous with the big
E's and all. This weekend we have
our Annual Dinner in Derbyshire,
then after the exams a weekend of
cream teas i n Cornwall, then for
those lucky enough to be going, the
summer tour is to Norway for three
weeks!
Some of our number though have
organised an expedition to Peru for
a month or three. I would like to
wish them the best of luck on bahalf
of all the members of S & G , and to
those of vou that haven't bought a
T-Shirt from them, do so soon.
Good luck chaps, don't go falling off
anything!

Carnival
Carnival
This was a storming success with
one of the best bands we've had
at College for a long time.
Apologies to anyone who had to
wait for a long time to get the
minibus home. One of the buses
had been taken b y St Mary's
R u g b y Club w h e n it w a s n ' t
booked by them and the other
had to make an unscheduled trip
to the hospital with one of the
evening's casualties.
Many thanks to all who helped
and who've helped a l l year,
particularly M i l a n Lester f o r
driving the van practically until
dawn.
