•Cycling in India
Gary Hastings and Malcolm
McCarthy spend three months
cycling in India.
We spent a week in Dehli preparing
and planning our trip and set out on
a h o t a n d h u m i d N o v e m b e r
morning, with only a vague idea of
where we were going. Our only aim
was to experience the splendour of
the Indian Himalayas.
It took twenty minutes for the first
problem of the tour to arise: I had
a puncture and w e were i n a
crowded bazaar on the outskirts of
Dehli.
A crowd started to gather as soon
as we stopped. The crowd grew to
at least 200 people and children
pushed their way to the front only
to be ejected by adults wishing to
witness the spectacle.
The 'crowd' is a characteristic of
urban living in India. It's like living
your whole life i n a crowded
London tube station. There is n o
such thing as privacy or personal
space.
The traffic on the highway was
chaotic b u t c o l o u r f u l . Every
conceivable mode of transportation
was o n the road: rickshaws, carts,
donkeys, dogs and cows.
The only rule o n the Indian
highways is.if it's bigger than you,
get out of the way. Since the
highway has only one lane, smaller
vehicles are regularly forced off the
road into the dust tracks on either
side of the highway.
It wasn't long before we were
unceremoniously dumped i n the
dust and, since the dust seemed to
be littered with razor sharp thorns,
we were soon -repairing more
punctures.
• Tourist buses regularly drive
lorries off the road and all along the
route one can see overturned lorries,
their cargoes strewn everywhere.
Unperturbed drivers can often be
seen relaxing amongst the wreckage
and consuming the cargo (if it's
edible), presumably waiting for help
to arrive. We could not envisage the
same tranquility being shown by a
driver on the M l suffering a similar
fate.
A t midday, the heat of the plains
is unbearable, so we decided to pull
into a dhaba for much needed
refreshments.
Initially we had planned to cook
our own food but it didn't take us
long to appreciate the convenience,
not to mention the excellent food,
of the dhabas which were littered
along the highways.
This dhaba was far from the
cleanest we had ever seen; the
normally appetising Indian sweets
were covered by a layer of flies and
wasps. Dust covered everything
else, including the owners of the
establishment who were squatting
on a clay ledge which housed an
oven fuelled by slabs of dried dung.
Undaunted we entered and were
introduced to the delicious
beverage: chai. Geared to the very
sweet tooth, the beverage is
prepared by endlessly boiling
buffalo milk, water, tea and copious
amounts of sugar. Our enthusiasm
for the concoction and its energy
giving qualities were immense. We
downed five cups immediately and,
still thirsty, we tried some campa-
cola (India's answer to Coca-Cola).
We pulled into the 'Red Robin'
lodge near Sinipat at the end of the
first day. These lodges are all named
after birds and litter the highways
of the Harayana.
W e set out early the following
morning and, after stopping to
repair another puncture, we reached
P a n i p u t w h i c h , according to
Moslem legend, is the most fly
infested area i n all India.
We stopped at a dhaba and left
the crowds to ponder over our
mountainbikes. Usually, in such
situations, there is an on-hand
expert to e x p l a i n the finer
specifications to the, exclusively
male, audience. These 'experts'
assume the right to touch, prod and
tinker with whatever takes their
fancy without considering to ask
you if it's okay. This particular
expert pointed knowingly to our
water bottles and said, 'petrol!'.
Soon we reached Karma Lake
lodge ten miles outside of Kamal.
The chowkidar tried to convince me
the place was full even though it
was obviously empty. Politeness
was not going to sway this man's
mind but when I threatened to write
to the Harayana Tourist Board we
were offered a tool shed behind the
lodge. After inspecting the shed I
decided that going back to Karmal
was by far the more attractive of the
two choices.
Meanwhile, Malcolm had made
friends with an engineer who took
a great interest i n our bikes. This
man seemed to have a magical
control over the chowkidar and,
with a wave of - his hand, h a d
managed to secure us a room and
for chai to be brought immediately.
This type of incident was not
uncommon; whenever we were
down, someone always came along
and provided us with invaluable
help. People were forever asking us
if we required their assistance.
Indeed, all one had to do was look
at a map in a public place and aid
was immediately offered without
having to ask.
Despite the inaccuracy of our
Indian maps, we found the turning
for Nahan and thus began our
journey around the edge of the
Punjab and into the mountains...
