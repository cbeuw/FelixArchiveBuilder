Crisis in College company forces takeover
Biotech buyout
Imperial Biotechnology, partly
owned by Imperial College and a
world leader in the fast expanding
Bacterial products market, is to be
taken over by an Austrailian
company. Five years of world class
award winning, academic research
are likely to pass out of British
hands.
Burns Philp are to take over
Imperial Biotechnology Limited
(IBL) by the end of the month, if IBL
shareholders approve. The move
will aleviate cash flow problems
within IBL which have resulted i n
the company making an operating
loss of % of a million pounds last
year.
A letter has been circulated to IBL
shareholders detailing Burns Philp's
intention to 'buy out' IBL. Imperial
c o l l e g e , the second largest
shareholder, has already announced
its intention to sell its 88,473 shares,
worth an estimated £600,000.
Imperial Biotechnology was set up
five years ago to research a n d
market enzymes for the food
industry. The company took over
redundant fermentation units in the
Biochemistry Department and was
given office space at a nominal rent
in return for shares in the company.
The company has been making a
loss for some time. College Finance
Officer, Malcombe Aldridge told
F E L I X ' t h e C o m p a n y is n o t
insolvent in a technical sense, but if
it continues with its present staffing
levels it will need additional capital
before much longer.'
He added 'We've allowed them
fairlv soft credit. Its not i n our
interests to put them over the trunk'
Sources within College say that
the c o m p a n y owes Imperial
£150,000 i n wages for the eight
technical staff w h o operate the
fermentation unit. The College now
IBL's fermentation unit, once owned by IC
sav that they have reached an
agreement with IBL to pay back the
money in monthly instalments of
£30,000.
College Secretary, John Smith, a
member of the IBL's Board of
Directors told FELIX that company
had performed badly because the
market had been slow to adapt to
new products/The sales before
Christmas were very good' he said
'but they tailed off in January,
February and March.'
Burns Philp bought a large
number of preferential shares in
December of last year in conjunction
with Investors i n Industry a n d
Protein Technology. The deal was
said to be worth Vi million to the
Company.
IBL have recently been awarded
the DTI Small Firms Merit Award
for Research and Technology. The
award will pay for 75% of the costs
of research into the way enymes can
be used to speed the maturation
process of Cheddar Cheese.
FELIX Savs
This is a black day for British
Technology. Britain has once again
given away one of its leading
technologies to a foreign competitor.
It is a sad indictment of ten years
of Thatcherism that British firms are
unwilling to invest in an area of
research which has so much
commercial potential.
The Australians have been quick
to realise the possibilities of
biotechnology one of the most
rapidly developing industries.
The market is not yet ready to
accept the techniques developed by
Imperial Biotechnology and this has
resulted in an uphill financial
struggle for the company.
But when the market place does
catch up, those British investors
w h o refused to back the company
in its recent attempts to raise more
capital will be left in the cold.
Tube strike
hits exams
Imperial College U n i o n has
prepared emergency measures to
help students taking exams if the
threatened 24 hour tube strike by
the National Union of Railwaymen
(NUR) goes ahead.The College has
made similar plans for members of
staff.
The strike was announced o n
Wednesday w h e n negotiations
between Unions and Management
over proposed changes i n staffing
and promotion for the bus and
underground services broke down.
Bus services should run normally
on Monday but a series of one-day
stoppages on every second Monday
f r o m M a y 15 is threatened
depending the result of yesterday's
ballot.
Some departments w i l l be
rescheduling examinations and plan
to inform students of any changes
that are made whilst others are
considering allowing students to
sleep overnight. In some cases the
starting time of examinations will be
delayed with a greater leniancy for
late-comers. The College say that
individual departments will keep
students informed of the changes.
The Students' Union plan to
provide an minibus service for those
students affected. The service will
be available for the duration of the
strike for students who register with
the Union Office before 2.00pm
today.
In addition, the Green and Brown
Committee rooms i n the Union
Buiding will be set aside for use as
a 'crash p a d ' on Sunday a n d
Monday evenings.
Union President Nigel Baker
commented 'there are showers for
men and ladies in the gym loos.' He
added that the Union Snack Bar
would be available for meals as
usual but warned students to bring
their own sleeping bags.
The College has sent a circular to
members of staff urging them to
'make every reasonable effort' to
