If Fleischmann and Pons are right and cold fusion
is possible — what, asks Tony Spencer, will be
the consequences?
Cheap, clean and
doomed?

SCIENCE
The recent claims for the discovery
of fusion at room temperature by
Drs. Pons and Fleischmann raise
some interesting questions about
the future, assuming the claims
prove to be justified.
If what they have found is indeed
fusion, or even a new form of
chemical energy, then the potential
benefits for mankind could be
enormous. The process seems to
produce no unwanted by-products
such as carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, or long-term radioactivity.
Large scale use of this new form of
energy would be a lifesaver for the
ecology of the planet, giving us a
real chance to reverse the damage
already done to the environment.
It seems that we could be at the
dawn of a new age of cheap power,
something that would not only help
the development of the third world,
but would also help reduce the
American budget deficit. It would
see domestic a n d commercial
energy bills cut drastically to the
benefit of both rich and poor.
Clearly such a n e w source is
essential if the Third World is to
develop to anywhere near Western
living standards. Last year America,
with about a twentieth of the
Worlds population accounted for
43% of the World's oil consumption
- there is simply not enough fuel
available for the rest of the World to
live like this.
D r H a g e l s t e i n of the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) has already
applied quantum mechanics to cold
deuterium fusion. He claims it may
be possible to produce fusion driven
lasers, small fusion generators,
reverse fusion (What! - Science Ed.)
and new exotic fusion reactions. The
idea of suitcase sized power stations
may be exciting, but the real
revolution would be small portable
fusion generators.
Provided that such generators
were small enough, say the size of
an internal combustion engine or
less, and were relatively cheap to
make a n d service (presumably
heavy water and palladium and
platinum electrodes are not that
expensive), it is conceivable that
they could be self-contained, with
a solar panel to provide the initial
'push'. With a life expectancy in
excess of twenty of thirty years,
such generators would be essential
for the rapid development of the
Third world, enabling power to be
available cheaply, and without
transport costs or problems with the
fuel supply. This, coupled with the
environmental benefits, make it a
very attractive proposition.
As with any new radical idea,
whether or not it gains widespread
acceptance largely depends o n
vested interests. Cold fusion could
destroy some industries. O i l
companies would probably suffer
most, along with gas and electricity
generating companies. The internal
combustion engine could become as
outdated as the steam engine, and
there is the danger that a lot of
Engineering jobs could be lost and
equipment made redundant.
Large corporations wield a lot of
power and influence, a n d it is
possible that these organisations
may seek to inhibit the development
of such a revolutionary idea. A s
with the everlasting light bulb and
rust-proof stainless steel cars,
multinationals are likely to buy up
the patent and sit on it, smothering
the development of a new idea.
With so much at stake, there is a real
likelihood that there would be major
opposition to the widespread
development of this new fusion
process.
For better or worse, in order for
this new technology to see the light
of day, we may have to encourage
oil companies and other affected
parties to develop a n d
commercialise the fusion process
themselves, allowing them to
diversify. With care, this could be
handled to everyone's satisfaction:
the n e w applications could be
developed and the oil companies
could use their stocks for essential
chemicals.
Failure to take these implications
into account may result i n the
technology being ' s t i l l - b o r n ' ,
leaving the Third World, Mankind
and the ecology of the planet back
at square one, with the continued
squandering of resources and the
world taking a step backwards
rather than a leap ahead.

OSC FOOTBALL
Cyprus v
India
The inter-society indoor Football
Tournament organised by the O S C
ended last term with the Cvpriots
beating the Indians 19-5 i n a
convincing finals victory. Although
the match was one-sided right from
the beginning, the Indians put up
a gallant effort. Nevertheless, the
skills of the reigning champions
proved to be too much for the
Indians.
Earlier, i n the semifinals, the
Indians overpowered the Afro-
Caribbeans 11-8, while the Cvpriots
entered the finals bv beating the
Italians 14-12.
In total 9 societies took part in this
event. Apart from the Chinese and
the Sri Lankan societies, which
didn't even bother to turn up for
their matches, the teams put in
tremendous efforts and snowed
much anticipation and eagerness.
Despite the high standards
displayed each of the participating
teams this year, there can however
be only one.single winner, and the
Cypriots yet again emerged as the
champions.

The tennis season is upon us (so
please tell the weather!), and it is
not too late to join IC Lawn Tennis

allows play on the two tennis courts
adjacent to Prince's Gardens, and
the availability of these courts is
controlled by weekly booking sheets
at the desk of the Sports Centre.
To join the Club, send your name
