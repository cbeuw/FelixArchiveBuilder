Carnival Mayhem
Crazy
The Union building was packed as
full as fire regulations would allow
with an estimated 1200 students
present at the Carnival last Friday.
The event made a Â£200 loss which
Ian Morris, the Union H o n Sec,
claims was predicted before the
event.
There were three bands, and a
variety of comedy acts performing.
The first band to open was Stop
laughing; a concoction of heavy
metal guitars with weak-sounding
vocals. The audience judged the
band by emptying the hall rapidly.
Following this were the comedy
acts, which were not well received;
there were shouts of obscenities
throughout most of the
performances. One comedian was
narrowly missed by a full beer-can
t h r o w n by a member of the
audience.
The other bands were The
Butterfield 8, a rhythm and blues
band, which produced some good
dance music, and Bad Manners; a
band with a style of their own.
There was some doubt as to how
long Bad Manners would be playing,
since they walked off the stage
refusing to continue after they were
prevented by the Dramatic Society
from taking a bucket of water onto
the stage. After a small pause the
band took their places back on the
stage; without the bucket of water.
There were objections on the
grounds that the carnival might

This Easter, the Natural History
Museum opened an exhibition
called 'Dinosaurs Live!'. As the title
suggests, the display is supposed to
convey the impression of being in
the presence of some long dead
creatures, w h i c h have been
mysteriously brought back to life.
This amounts to a cross between a
history p r o g r a m m e , a n d a
prehistoric chamber of horrors.
The atmosphere is rather
impressive; there are jungle noises,
dimmed green lights and the odd
plastic palm. The 'Dinosaurs' are in
small enclosures, from which they
tower impressively over the human
form. The larger dinosaurs are built
to half scale, but even so, the
Tyrannosaurus manages to leer
down quite successfully.
The creatures are built from a
metal framework, and are driven by
compressed air. This is all covered
by a convincing rubber skin, upon
which is modelled the features of
the dinosaur, as guessed at by
scientists everywhere. The heads
(including eyes) and a few other
parts of the dinosaurs' anatomy are
animated, moving to the commands
of a preset p r o g r a m . These
sequences have been well designed;
the dinosaurs look down to the
place where people are most likely
to stand, and although this is not
exactly frightening it is, to say the
least, unnerving.
However, there are drawbacks to
the display. Since the automated
have a n adverse effect o n
examinations. O n e finalist
commented, T had had two exams
that day and was feeling a bit
knackered'. H e said that he had
been unable to sleep, adding that he
had also had an examination on the
Tuesday following the carnival.
Another student living in Beit said,
even though he had attended and
enjoyed the carnival, 'Nobody slept
on this landing that night'.
Ian Morris replied to this by
saying that a questionnaire asking
whether people would object to the
carnival had been put under ail
residential doors in Beit Hall, asking
if there were any objections to the
carnival taking place. This was
circulated prior to Easter, and there
were no objections to the event
taking place. Ian Morris assured
FELIX that the carnival would have
been cancelled if there had been any
objections beforehand, but none
were received.
metal skeletons are powered by
compressed air, there is an audible
hiss whenever anv part of the
dinosaurs move. This is with the
sole exception of their eyes; they
click whenever the dinosaur casts a
quick glance in either direction.
However., their m a i n fault,
occurring only with the larger
skulled models, is that their heads
are too heavy. Whenever the head
stops moving, it seems to do so too
q u i c k l y , because there is a
significant wobble whenever they
come to rest.
O n the press day, there was an
added attraction, which will not be
joining the rest of the display; an
eight foot tall w a l k i n g
Tyrannosaurus Rex. Unfortunately,
this dinosaur was not of the robotic
kind. Instead, it consisted of a man
inside a rather sturdy inflatable
rubber suit. This, to the press, was
much more interesting than the
display, and the organisers had to
threaten to take it away, to bring the
journalists and photographers back
to the display.
The exhibition also has many
spin-offs; there is a dinosaur shop
situated next-door which, if not built
specifically for the occasion, will
certainly benefit from the increased
enthusiasm in dinosaurs.
Altogether, 1 would say that the
display is an interesting part of the
museum and admission is free in
the last hour so it is well worth a
look.
Prince Philip
(nearly) visits
ICU Carnival
Last Friday, as students were
starting to turn up for the Carnival,
security cordoned off the Sherfield
Building in readiness for the arrival
of Prince Philip, the Duke of
E d i n b u r g h . T h e Prince w a s
attending the annual dinner of the
British Antartic Society held in the
Staff Senior Common Room.
In a joint secuity operation
between the Royalty Protection
squad, the local police and ICs own
security staff: the doors to Sherfield
were locked and a number of
policemen patrolled the college.
Security Chief, Geoff Reeves, said
later that the security arrangements
went 'very smoothly'.
