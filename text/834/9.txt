The
Plantagenets
Shakespearian historical soap
operas have become fashionable
theatre entertainment. After the
lavish seven-play history cycle
staged at the O l d Vic earlier this
vear, which expunged the word
anachronism' from every critic's
pen; comes a more traditional, yet
no less spectacular three-play
extravaganza, reworked bv the RSC
from Shakespeare's Henrv VI parts
I, II, and III and Richard'III.
The plays spread a colourful
length of history. Illustrating a
nation's collapse from prosperous
stability and conquering patriotism,
through the horrors of civil war, a
reign of tyranny and on to a
conclusion of harmonic optimism.
Intricate webs of political intrigue
are woven, a n d violent, bloody
battles are fought in this chronicle
of a fascinating 65 year period in
English history.
Three kings of starkly contrasting
character sit in turn upon the throne
of England: Henry VI, a pious
saintly figure, ill-equipped to tackle
the politics of power; Edward IV, a
lewd sensualist; and Richard III, a
crazed tvrant, full of malicious
intent.
Henry VI
Ralph Fiennes is superb as the
uncertain, w i m p i s h H e n r y ; a
reluctant ruler proclaimed King at
nine months old. As his realm is
split bv war, intrigue and factions,
he seeks peace and consolation in
religious books and study. The
members of his court vie for power;
the French army, headed by Joan of
Arc and the Dauphin, drive the
English out of France; and the feud
between Lancaster a n d York
intensifies, but Henry stands aloof
and innocent as chaos unfolds
around him.
The Rise of Edward IV
Much of the second play consists of
scenes of military or civil warfare, as
Richard of York strives for Henry's
throne. The ruinous feuding of the
nobility is parodied by a peasant
rebellion led by the ribald Jack Cade,
who believes himself to be heir to
the crown.
Battles ensue a n d fortunes
meander with dizzying intricacy.
We see elaborate displays of
swirling flags, glittering armour,
blood strewn fights and frenzied
motion. Unfortunately, the brutally
unsettling battlefield scene in which
Queen Margaret splatters York's
face with the blood of his dead son
is wasted in mayhem.
After York's death his sons rally
and defeat the Lancastrians, and so
Edward, the eldest, becomes king.
Immediately, the scene changes to
one of voluptuous frivolity, with a
giant golden disc hanging over a
court of loitering lovers. In amongst
this, the warped figure of Richard,
Edward's brother, stands out as a
soured misfit.
Richard III, His Death
There is an obvious difference in
style between this and the previous
plays. The bombastic vertiginous
evolution of the first two plays
contrast with a more subtle and
emotive play on greed and tyranny,
significant of a more mature bard.
The play opens with Richard in a
drunken stupor, declaring ' N o w is
the winter of our discontent made
glorious by the son of York', an
interesting twist to the more
traditional opening.
Richard schemes his way to the
crown. One by one his foes line up
for execution. One by one they exit
offstage into a corridor of light to
meet the axeman's blade, as the
atmosphere becomes greyer and
more sinister with each of Richard's
conquests.
Anton Lesser is mesmerising as
Richard. He is quirky, unpredictable
and revels i n his manipulations,
deriving a genuine sadistic pleasure
from his actions.
After a particularly gruesome
death scene for Richard, in which
one is left wondering whether the
actor would rise for the curtain call,
the Earl of Richmond steps forward
to take the throne and signal a new
era of national unity and Tudor rule.
After all the carnage and pageantry,
the cycle ends with simple
understatedness.
In general, the acting throughout
the production is of a very high
standard, although lesser roles are
not as memorable as the 'War of the
Roses' series. There is no Michael
Pennington or Sion Probert injecting
life into a minor character.
Penny D o w n i e as Q u e e n
Margaret is the one link through all
the plays. Her degeneration from
sexy young queen, to power hungry
bitch, to ranting senile woman is
impressively convincing.
Inspired set and costume design,
as well as A d r i a n N o b l e ' s
flamboyant and confident direction,
pull the production together into a
glorious tapestry of Shakespearean
drama; although nine hours may be
a bit too much.
The Plantagenets continues at the
Barbican until July 3rd, with the
whole trilogy played every Saturday
until then. Ticket prices start at £6
per play.

High Spirits
In the heart of the Emerald Isle lies
Castle Plunkett, majestic a n d
masterful, ancient and knackered.
The hotel, as the building purports
to be, is empty and under threat of
a take-over from an American who
wishes to transport the castle to
Vlalibu and make a theme park of it.
In a desperate move to save his
home, Peter P l u n k e t t (Peter
O'Toole) advertises the place as a
haven for ghosts, and is then treated
to a party of American tourists, a
mixed bunch including a nympho-
maniac with desires on a young
priest, and a parapsychologist and
family.
The castle staff e m p l o y
themselves in a bungling series of
ghostly fakes and completely fail to
impress the guests, including the
kids. Didn't you ever see Nightmare
on Elm Street? The castle is doomed.
The real ghosts meanwhile decide
to do something about this—they
don't want to live in California.
While they create mayhem amongst
the staff and visitors alike, a couple
of love-hate relationships are
becoming m i x e d u p i n the
background. But the real world and
the spectral w o r l d cannot
intertwine, except once a year.
T h a n k g o d i t ' s H a l l o w e ' e n
tomorrow.
High Spirits is amiable enough,
with a wonderful script and a good
cast. Steve Guttenberg and Daryl
Hannah play the lovers, sweetly
and innocently, the victims of
events. A m o n g s t a hoard of
ghoulish creatures, the delightfully
comic O'Toole is often the most
moribund, even without makeup.
The castle itself is convincingly
atmospheric, a n d provides an
appropriately characteristic setting
for the occasional visual effects
which intersperse the chaos. For all
its musty tincture there is a definite
glint of emerald green running
through the film, and that makes it
all the more appealing.
Well worth a look.
