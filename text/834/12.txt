Hawking at IC
Staff and students packed into the
Great Hall on Thursday evening to
hear Stephen Hawking, Lucasian
Professor of M a t h e m a t i c s at
Cambridge, give a lecture o n
Imaginary Time'. Hundreds of
others were unable to attend
because of shortage of space.
The lecture was the second of the
Schrodinger Lectures, named i n
honour of the quantum mechanics
pioneer, and was chaired by the
Rector, Professor Eric A s h .
Professor H a w k i n g , w h o is
confined to a wheelchair and is
severly disabled makes use of a
computerised speech synthesizer.
Professor Hawking said that the
synthiser give him an 'accent' which
had been described variously as
American, Scandinavian or Irish.
He is probably best known as the
writer of the scientific best-seller ' A
Brief History of Time' which has
t o p p e d both the British a n d
American best-seller lists and been
translated into 22 languages.
Professor Hawking said that he
knew the book was a sucess when
he heard that it had been translated
into Servo-Croat.
In the lecture the Professor
described the theory that time may
not be a simple 'linear' quantity
moving steadily from a beginning to
an end, but two quantities, the 'real'
time we measure or think we
measure a n d a n unobservable
'imaginary time'. By travelling i n
imaginary time we may be able to
travel into the future or back into the
past of our own universe and even
into other so-called parellel
universes. It may also provide the
key to combining relativity and
quantum mechanics into a single
theory.
IC cleared of legionella
A n independent report has pin-
pointed cooling towers i n the
Science Museum as the source of
the recent outbreak of legionnaires
disease i n South Kensington.
The report rules out towers at
ImDerial College as the source of
infection, but the Health and Safety
Executive have placed a prohibition
order o n the College's towers until
their recommendations can be
implemented.
Head of Health and Safety at IC,
Dr Hargreaves, said that the College
intends to phase out cooling towers
and install heat pumps before the
hot weather starts.
M r D a v i d Evans of the
maintenance section said this was
'impossible' and expects the work
to be finished by October. Work on
the Biochemistry tower is due to
begin within a month, followed by
the Mechanical Engineering tower; .
AUTEGM
The extremely short a n d not
particularly well attended E G M held
vesterday, discussed just three
motions s u p p l i e d b y U n i o n
President Nigel D Baker.
The first of these dealt with Union
policy towards the A U T action
which supported their aims but
criticised their policy of not marking
exam papers. The motion was
passed with ammendments from
Thomas Wyatt which noted that the
universities no longer have the
money available for the pay rise
being asked for by the A U T . Nigel
will write letters to the Committee
of Vice Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP), the A U T and the Rector
detailing the new stance of I C U
towards the A U T , and condemning
the C V C P for withdrawing from the
negotiation process.
Course changes were covered i n
the second motion especially
Geology courses which have been
changed from the description given
in the College Prospectus. It was
agreed to ask College to withdraw
the disclaimer in the Prospectus
which prevents students from
sueing them in the event of a course
change (as happened to Aston
University).

turn up to work. The circular states
that four or five mile walks are not
'unreasonable' and says that flexible
working hours, including work at
home, can be arranged with Heads
of Department.
Those staff w h o are not i n
possession of parking permits have
been asked not to bring their cars
into College, but a car sharing
scheme is available by contacting the
Registry on extensions 3309 and
3310.
A n N U R spokeswoman told
FELIX that' the Union will talk with
London Transport right up until the
deadline.' She expressed sympathy
with student examinees but added
'if you students had only a one year
contract for a job and a family, y o u
w o u l d probably feel just as
desperate.'
London Transport described the
N U R s ' action as ' s o m e w h a t
stubborn' and has gained a High
Court injunction to prevent the
strike.
The departments and years that
will be affected are: Maths I,
Geology (Mining) I, Geology II and
III, Mineral Resources Engineering
(Petroleum Engineering II, Hi and
IV), Electrical Engineering III and IV
and Chemical Engineering III and
IV.
Civ Eng students angry
Irate second year Civil Engineering
students claimed they had been
'messed around' this week when
the Civ Eng department reschedul-
ed an exam that had been post-
poned by the A U T strike.
Students were given only eight
days notice of the exam when they
returned from theEaster break. This
is despite assurances that the exam
would not be held in M a y and that
there would be two weeks notice of
the date.
A petition calling for the exam to
be boycotted was signed by about
eighty per cent of the class.
Students approached U n i o n
Honorary Secretary, Ian Morris on
Tuesday, calling for the exam to be
cancelled. M r Morris and Union
President, N i g e l Baker I C U
conducted a straw poll amongst Civ
Eng II later i n the week and were
told that the exam should be
canceled. If this was not possible,
said the students, they would like
the exam to go ahead on the original
date rather than have it interfere
with the rest of their exams.
The Head of Section, M r Chiat,
was not prepared to cancel the test,
but agreed to provide sample
questions. H e said the standard of
the exam was easier than i n
previous years, and agreed to
release the distribution curves from
this year and last year so that
students could be sure they were
being fairly treated.
M r Sharma, one of the lecturers
responsible for the course, told
FELIX that the exam was only part
of the course and that success in the
course was not dependent upon
passing it. He claimed that students
had been provided with three
unscheduled hours of help in the
week before the exam. H e went on
to say that the date had been set in
consultation with the Civ Eng Dep
Rep and said that the exam would
have been too close to the main
exams had 15 days notice been
given.
Students in the department said
after the exam that it was 'a pathetic
exam, set out of a bloody-minded
desire to have an exam at all costs'
and that they 'should have asked for
the exam mark to be reduced as a
proportion of the course'.
