Italian delights
FELIX culinary expert, Yishu Nanda continues his
gastronomic exploration of Italy. This week Yishu
samples the delights of Milan and Verona and brings you
the recipes for two authentic Italian pasta dishes.
A selection of cured meats.
Part 3
Fine food in a Milan home
The Italians have a profound love
for their food. Even in Milan the
fast city lifestyle cannot detract
from a proud display of cooking at
home. I hope to give you a flavour
of the casalinga that one could
expect to enjoy.
Staying with the Rossies in Milan
was an opportunity to see how the
lovers of food tread the compromise
between enjoying food and a fast
lifestyle in which both husband and
wife work. 1 cannot enjoy good food
without giving some in return, so I
took three home-made fruit cakes
with me to present to friends in
Italy.
On Saturday m o r n i n g I
accompanied them to a street
market to buy the cheeses, cured
meats, vegetables, fruits just as 1 do
in Chapel market in Islington. They
bought some Parmigiano, pecorino (an
ewes milk cheese), fontina,
mozzarella, scamorza, ricotta cheeses.
The ricotta cheese must be enjoyed
as fresh as possible and was bought
to be consumed at lunch that day.
The cured or cooked meats were
also bought in generous
proportions. We chose to get spek
Tyrolese, prosciutto crude, salami and
some pancetta. The cheese and meat
products are not inexpensive, but
thev give the Italians the flexibility
to feed themselves and their guests
conveniently. I was to discover that
wherever I went the Italians would
offer a platter ladden with razor thin
slices of the cured meats, another
with the cheeses on proud display
and a basket of bread.
A simple salad such as tomatoes
and capers in an olive oil and lemon
juice dressing would also be passed
around.
The home cooking that I enjoyed
in Milan included a simple fusilli
pasta flavoured with butter and
cinnamon. The timballo (macaroni
baked in bechamel sauce, tomatoes,
black olives) is an impressive pasta
dish when brought piping hot from
the oven to the table. I also admired
a simple dish of red peppers cooked
in tomatoes, onions, garlic and
herbs. It is rare that peppers are
enjoyed on their own.
The Rossi family also provided a
display of cooking which requires a
litte more effort. A visit to Milan
would not be complete without
trying a risotto Milanese so it was
prepared for me. There was also the
torta salata, a pie made from spinach,
mozzarella, fontina, parniegianno, eggs
and nutmeg.
I also enjoyed a spaghetti al pesto.
The pesto is a sauce made from
garlic, basil and pine nuts. The
Rossies make it a few times a year.
It is frozen and used a little at a time.
Another successful way of enjoying
flavoursome sauces without the toil.
Serve the spaghetti pesto with
ground pecorino cheese as the
Genovese do.
No trip to Italy is complete
without a trip to a wine cellar. I had
the opportunity to visit the enoteca
Limbardi delta Certosa di Pavia near the
Certosa monastrv in Pavia. The reds
Some Recipes
CRESCENTINE
350gr white wheat flour
1.5 wine glasses of water
25gr yeast
Itsp sunflower oil
htsp salt
Method:
Make the dough and leave it covered in
a warm place for Vi hour. Roll out apple
size balls into face size oval discs.
Shallow fry on a medium flame for
several minutes, turning a few times,
until both fides are cooked.
Zelina spoke of the revival of the use
of chestnuts in the cuisine. She gave
me her recipe to make castagnaccio,
a cake made from chestnut flour.
During the Second World War the
castagnaccio was eaten as a bread
because chestnut flour was available
much more easily than wheat flour.
C A S T A G N O C C I O

p r o d u c e d i n this region are
considered to be better than the
whites.
Eating out in Milan
I recommend going to the La
Spaghetteria di Via Solferino, 3 Via
Solferino (Tel. 872735). The chef
prepares a sauce which is served
with spaghetti. Everyone is offered
a small bowl of the pasta and the
surprise sauce. If the sauce does not
tempt you then you can wait for the
sauce of the next round. One can
carry on eating for as many rounds
as one likes. The meal for everyone
at the table is offered free if any
individual can break the record
number of rounds of spaghetti
consumed. I think the record stands
at about 45. The portion offered in
each round is not large so that one
can sample as many sauces as
possible.
Part 4
A taste of Veronaâ€”Veronesi
tutti matti!
The ' m a d ' Veronese pride
themselves for their Peru and
Polenta.
I saw the polenta made in the
traditional way. The coarse ground
maize was continuously stirred by
arm for about half an hour as it
absorbed the boiling liquid. It was
served in the shape of a mound on
a wooden platter. Slices of the
polenta were served with a sauce
made from porcini mushrooms. In
Verona they also eat it with thin
slices of salami and gorgonzola
cheese. A good polenta should be
moist but firm. A good texture of
finish can only be achieved with
years of cooking experience.
The m u s h r o o m sauces that
pervade" Italian casalinga are the
finest. Often the mushrooms have
been hand-picked in the nearbv
woodland. I was shown some
whole porcini mushrooms which
had been sealed individually for
freezing. A l t e r n a t i v e l y , the
mushrooms are sliced and dried.
My thanks to Eleo Arrighi for
presenting me with a packet of his
h a n d - p i c k e d , home d r i e d
mushrooms.
The pera, a favourite in the local
cuisine, is a sauce made from
adding bread crumbs to a broth
containing marrows. It is served in
generous proportions to accompany
bollito misto (slow cooked meats) and
vegetables.
I would like to thank the Rossies,
Arrighies and Zullos for making this
tour a great success.
