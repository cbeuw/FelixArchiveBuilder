Despite a m a n i f e s t o w h i c h didn't actu-
ally c o m m i t U n i o n President D a v e Hel-
lard t o a n y t h i n g , h e still feels h e h a s
a c h i e v e d a lot d u r i n g t h e last s e v e n
m o n t h s . H e believes h e has s w i t c h e d
the f o c u s o n t o t h e day-to-day issues
w h i c h really affect students - like Lon-
d o n Transport, t h e library a n d health-
c e n t r e , a n d d i s c o u n t s .
C o n s e q u e n t l y , h e ' d like
his year in office to b e
r e m e m b e r e d as " t h e
year t h e U n i o n c a m e
back to the students".
A l o n g s i d e this, h e ' d
also like t o b e r e m e m b e r e d for setting
s o m e l o n g e r term projects in m o t i o n -
like the e x p a n s i o n into Beit Q u a d a n d
the p r o p o s e d U n i o n Job Shop (both d u e
to begin in S u m m e r 2000). Dave has also
put a lot of e m p h a s i s o n Student Devel-
o p m e n t , a n d h o p e s to set up a "Student
D e v e l o p m e n t W e e k " for next year.
N o n e t h e l e s s , he admits that he has
m a n a g e d t o a c h i e v e far less this year
than h e had initially h o p e d , " p r o b l e m s
w i t h clubs, the C C U ' s a n d U L U s e e m t o
eat up m y t i m e " . The w o r k l o a d has also
c o m e as s o m e t h i n g o f a s h o c k to t h e
system, "the level o f administration is
h u g e , a n d , for t h e m o s t part, thank-
less".
"the year the
Union came back
to the students"
O n t h e other h a n d , Dave sees o n e
of the biggest plus points of the j o b as
the o p p o r t u n i t y for lots of public speak-
i n g a n d m e e t i n g p e o p l e . Indeed this
m a y prove t o b e only the first step o n
t h e road t o p o w e r - a l t h o u g h Dave has
d e c i d e d that he hates "Politics with a big
P", h e is l o o k i n g to w o r k in the Foreign
O f f i c e o r w i t h t h e U N
" a n d I w o u l d n ' t m i n d
b e i n g an A m b a s s a d o r " .
So w h a t m a k e s a
g o o d President? A c c o r d -
i n g t o Dave, y o u simply
can't tell w h o w o u l d d o
the j o b w e l l , " y o u just h a v e to listen t o
w h a t t h e y p r o m i s e t o d o , a n d h o p e
they f o c u s o n the issues". H e admits
that h e is far f r o m perfect "you n e e d
s o m e o n e w h o ' s m o r e responsible than
m e in t h e w a y t h e y a d m i n i s t e r t h e
U n i o n , but w h o w o n ' t let constitutional
j a r g o n get in the w a y o f d o i n g the j o b
properly".
A n d w o u l d h e d o the j o b again?
D a v e is a fervent believer in the b e n e -
fits o f a l l o w i n g sabbaticals t o run for a
s e c o n d t e r m , but w o u l d n ' t w a n t t o d o
it himself. "I w o u l d n ' t b e fully involved,
a n d I'd get e v e n m o r e egotistic than I
a m n o w . I've h a d m y c h a n c e - its time
to let s o m e o n e else h a v e their g o . "
Marie Nicholaou

Marie, h o w e v e r , readily a d m i t s that

Chris Ince was elected last J u n e o n a
m a n i f e s t o w h i c h p r o m i s e d a t h o r o u g h
r e v i e w o f U n i o n s u b s i d y levels,
i n c r e a s e d t r a i n i n g f o r treasurers a n d
proper r u n n i n g o f club finances - all o f
w h i c h are n o w in progress. Despite the
fact that problems continue to stream in,
Chris believes that the training was very
w o r t h w h i l e , "it was w o r t h
g i v i n g t r a i n i n g t o t h e
m e d i c s , e v e n if t h e y
i g n o r e d it. I just wish I'd
t a k e n a list o f w h o w a s
there".
T h e really b i g issues
this year, as far as Chris is c o n c e r n e d ,
h a v e b e e n t h e Beit E x p a n s i o n a n d
minibuses. Both o f these issues have
• s e e n a great deal o f progress (with the
U n i o n d o i n g surprisingly well In Beit),
but it will take a l o n g time for the results
to filter t h r o u g h . "That's o n e of the big
p r o b l e m s with this j o b -1 k n o w I w o n ' t
b e h e r e t o s e e t h e o u t c o m e o f m y
actions".
Chris also has t o accept that a big
part o f his j o b involves d a m a g e limita-
tion. M o r e o v e r , everything b e l o w £500
is basically d e l e g a t e d d o w n , s o h o w -
ever c o n s c i e n t i o u s h e is, " t h e r e will
always b e a big m e s s " . I n d e e d Chris
sees this as the worst part of his job, "the
"if I could do
the job again
would do"
M e d S c h o o l is a c o m p l e t e mess...l can't
b e e x p e c t e d t o p e r f o r m miracles for
t h o s e w h o d o n ' t play by the rules.
N o n e t h e l e s s , he is still p l e a s e d w i t h
h o w things have g o n e this year - par-
ticularly his w o r k i n g relationship with
President Hellard, "At the b e g i n n i n g o f
the year I w a s c o n c e r n e d that s o m e o n e
w h o wasn't involved w i t h
the U n i o n had the p o t e n -
tial to m a k e h u g e mistakes.
But h e ' s actually d o n e
really w e l l " .
So w o u l d Chris stand
for e l e c t i o n a g a i n , g i v e n
the c h a n c e ? "If I c o u l d stand again I
w o u l d d o . W h e n t h e n e w rector is
a p p o i n t e d w e s h o u l d p u s h really hard
for t h e right for t w o year sabbaticals".
M o r e o v e r there is o n e important les-
s o n w h i c h Chris h a s learnt, " i f I w a s
starting the year over, I w o u l d n ' t rely o n
a detailed c h a i n o f c o m m a n d - I'd g e t
detailed i n f o r m a t i o n t o e v e r y o n e per-
sonally".
A s k e d w h a t m a k e s a g o o d DP (F&S),
the a n s w e r is s i m p l e , "It's the o n e role
w h e r e y o u n e e d s o m e o n e really capa-
ble, yet tolerant, w h o can say m o r e than
just ' N o ' . "
A n d w h a t ' s t h e best t h i n g a b o u t
the job? "That p s e u d o s e n s e of p o w e r " .
Ed Sexton
Felix Editor
Ed Sexton's manifesto p r o m i s e d three
things: greater publicity, a higher standard
of writing and reps at every campus. Whilst
he has had great success with the first
two, Ed admits t o having
had more trouble with the
latter, "I made half an effort,
but there didn't s e e m to be
any interest". However, Ed
is very happy with t h e
improvements made in the
reviews sections this year, particularly in arts
and games. A b o v e all else, he'd like to b e
remembered for being "relaxed, approach-
able and considerate of both sides of the
argument".
Alongside this, Ed also believes that the
relationship with the Union has changed
this year. "Felix has b e c o m e m u c h m o r e
pro-Union - we'll still attack t h e m w h e n
necessary, but in general we're both o n the
same side".
So would he d o the job again? "No, but
not because I'm not enjoying it - it's just not
something you want to d o for m o r e than
"relaxed,
approachable
and considerate"
thirteen months". There are things he'd like
to d o differently If he started the year over.
A n important lesson is that people will only
d o things if you speak to t h e m personally,
face-to-face, "so I'd spend
more time out of the office,
rather than constantly emaiL
ing and phoning people".
Moreover, given the oppor-
tunity Ed believes he would
have tried far harder to keep
Felix c o m i n g out on Friday's.
O n e thing the year has taught Ed is the
myriad of abilities which the ideal Felix edi-
tor needs to embody. "You need to have
the technical knowledge; a genuine like of
student interests,- the ability to see the dif-
ference between what s o m e o n e writes
and w h o they are; and you have to be able
to write 400 words at six in the morning,
having b e e n awake for 24 hours".
A n d what's the best thing about the
job? "Walking around o n M o n d a y after-
n o o n s and seeing thousands of students
leafing through their copy of Felix."

priority as iclix Editor will

students to become
invoked through

Autumn term. As Imper-

ingly important that stu-
