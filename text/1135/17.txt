O
K OK, I'm sure there are a n u m b e r o f y o u out
there w h o are w o n d e r i n g w h e r e t h e hell in
the thriving vast expanse o f urban faeces
k n o w n as L o n d o n is t h e Hackney W a r e h o u s e . The
m o r e street wise a m o n g s t you, t h e o n e s with o n e ear
surgically attached to the g r o u n d , will b e fretting your
brows for not having heard of this v e nue . Well t h e
truth is, it's not a permanent v e n u e a n d has only just
o p e n e d for this night. It is in fact a teal w a r e h o u s e a n d
also t h e h o m e to Billy M a h o n i e ' s guitarist/bassist
Hywell. To be accurate there is n o traditional front
m a n as Billy M a h o n i e have n o singer, but m o r e of that
later.
The gig w a s t h e most u n d e r g r o u n d o n e I've ever
b e e n to, firstly it w a s invite only a n d secondly the
v e n u e w a s a f r e e z i n g w a r e h o u s e with n o bar a n d o n e
feeble portable heater o n t h e constant verge of col-
lapse. The crowd w a s mainly indie types f r o m all parts,
predominantly France a n d Japan a n d t h e a t m o s p h e r e
s o o n started to liven.
Billy M a h o n i e take their n a m e f r o m o n e o f t h e
characters out o f 'Flatliners', y o u k n o w the movie w h e r e
a b u n c h of college students experiment with near-
death by g o i n g 'flatline'. They are a four piece, with
Gavin o n guitar, Kev o n bass H o w a r d o n drums a n d
Hywell alternating between guitar and bass.They formed
at e n d of '97 a n d have released t w o singles since t h e n ,
Hoon and Whistling Sam. N o n e of Billy M a h o n i e ' s mate-
rial has h a d a w i d e distribution because they've only
released it through small indie labels. If y o u can't get
b e e n , w h e r e w e ' r e at a n d w h e r e w e ' r e g o i n g , "
explained Teddy, acclaimed architect o f the historic 80s
R&B/hip-hop revolution still globally revered as ' N e w Jack
Swing.'
Building o n the certified platinum foundation forged by
Blackstreet's debut 1994 self-titled, million seller C D ,
w h i c h s p a w n e d the t o p charted hits Bootie Call, Before
I Let Co, Joy, a n d Tonight's Ihe Night, t h e power of
Another Level is undeniable. The jeep ready a n d radio
friendly No Diggitywas the perfect funky b e g i n n i n g for
the red h o t quartets c o l d chlllin' a l b u m . Primarily
recorded at Teddy's state o f the art future Recording
studio in Virginia Beach, Virginia (where he a n d his fam-
ily also reside).
"We w o r k e d hard to give the a l b u m depth, substance
a n d m a x i m u m Blackstreet flavor," assures Riley, w h o s e
inspired musicianship, production a n d overall creative
genius is indelibly imprinted throughout t h e sizzling
hold of t h e m y o u should c h e c k o u t Moonlight Madness
o n Ride's Carnival of Light LP w h e r e t h e psychedelic
semi-instrumental m i m i c s Billy M a h o n i e ' s guitar crazi-
ness. Billy M a h o n i e a r e totally instrumental a n d this
aspect reinforces t h e interplay b e t w e e n t h e guitars.
There influences vary broadly f r o m dEUS a n d early
M o g w a i to M i l e s Davis a n d DJ S h a d o w .
There w a s a mixture o f styles to t h e s o u n d s they
produced, ranging f r o m m e l l o w jangly indie to mashed
up psychedelic m e a n d e r i n g t h r o u g h a s e a o f thrashed
out discordant guitar c h o p p i n g . T h e t e n d e n c y towards
the latter w a s o n the a g e n d a . Hywell w a s the most ener-
getic, thrashing himself a r o u n d while thrashing his gui-
tar a r o u n d a n d at t h e s a m e t i m e d r o p p e d his pick a n d
retrieved it f r o m t h e t a n g l e d m e s s o f wires o n t h e floor

For t h e future Billy M a h o n i e have a debut a l b u m

album. Outstanding tracks from the album
included: Good Lovin', a scintillating slow-
jam seductively delivered by Chauncey,
w h o equally excels o n t h e R&B Beautiful
Let's Stay In Love, Never Gonna Let You
Go, a tour-de-force romantic a n t h e m , sparked by Marks
explosive, scale d e f y i n g tenor; The Fix," a totally addic-
tive, head k n o d d i n ' Blackstreet butte track; / Can't Get
You Out Of My Mind, unforgettably p o w e r e d by Eric's
lush leads a n d Blackstreet's multi-layered harmony;
a n d Can't Buy Me Love, a serious soul remake o f the
Beatles '60s classic.
The departure o f Levi (Little) a n d David (Hollister) w a s
unexpected a n d looked as if could b e a little unsettling.
W h e n M a r k a n d Eric s t e p p e d in everyone o u t there
immediately realized t h e c h a n g e was just a blessing in
disguise. Their s o u n d b e c a m e stronger, tighter a n d
m o r e diverse, Eric a n d M a r k both s a n g incredible lead
vocals a n d harmonies.
Its no accident that Blackstreet's second long player w a s
titled Another Level. T e d d y illuminates: "from stronger
leads, to hyper harmony, to m o r e live instruments, to
e n d i n g t h e a l b u m o n a spiritual high note ( " G o d Is
Real"), " h e concludes, "this is t h e off-the-hook a l b u m
w e w a n t e d the first o n e to b e . " There's n o doubt that
this a l b u m is a pure classic skillz.
