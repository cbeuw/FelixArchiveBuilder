Two physicists at Exeter University
have reason to believe that butterflies
may o n e day be responsible for anti-
counterfeiting devices in credit cards a n d
bank notes, wide-angle liquid crystal dis-
plays or, if it takes your fancy, a n e w trend
for iridescent clothing. Peter Vukusic a n d
Professor Roy Sambles have Initiated a
rare collaboration b e t w e e n biology a n d
physics, t w o sections o f t h e scientific
c o m m u n i t y w h o are scarcely s e e n in t h e
same vicinity together, let alone por-
ing over t h e s a m e lab book.
The pair are l o o k i n g at butter-
flies a n d moths, w h o s e w i n g s pro-
d u c e t h e most striking, i n t e n s e

descent property Vukusic a n d Sam-
bles h o p e to discover t h e secrets
that lie b e h i n d their ability to pro-
duce such striking colours. They then •

effects artificially u n d e r UV, infrared |j

The iridescent nature o f m o t h s
a n d butterflies has m u c h t h e s a m e
effect as car headlights have w h e n
they shine onto a patch of e n g i n e oil
o n a wet road. In t h e s a m e w a y that
the colours in t h e oil c h a n g e as y o u
cross the road, a butterfly can appear J M j i L
in different colours, d e p e n d i n g o n I
the angle f r o m w h i c h y o u look at it.
The iridescence that w e s e e is jP
a product o f t h e light rays reflected
w h e n light hits a film that has a mirror-
like surface. W h e n t h e i n c o m i n g light
hits t h e t o p surface o f t h e film, s o m e o f
it is reflected. T h e rest carries o n travel-
ling t h r o u g h t h e material
until it reaches t h e lower
surface, w h e r e m o r e light

film affects t h e light's s p e e d a n d direc-
tion. The colours c h a n g e as t h e object or

the light.
This indicates that t h e iridescent
colours p r o d u c e d by butterflies are a

their w i n g s . Vukusic a n d Sambles have
