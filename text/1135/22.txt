Album of the Week
Coldcut
'Let us Replay"
This week's a l b u m of the w e e k c o m e s
in the f o r m of Coldcut's "let us replay",
and what a fine a l b u m it is too. It's a
weird a n d w o n d e r f u l a l b u m , a n d is the
culmination of a w o r l d tour of live
shows ( n o n e of this pre-recorded o n
DAT bollocks) in cities s u c h as
Barcelona a n d Tokyo. So what's the
album about? Well basically, it's loads
of progressive h o u s e t u n e s all o n o n e
CD; but Coldcut have had an influence
with e a c h track in s o m e f o r m or a n o t h -
er (e.g. remixing). All the tunes are
great a n d are by well-respected artists
such as Carl Craig. There are chilled
out tracks, vocal tracks e.g. the acoustic
warblings o f M i s s S e l e n a Saliva a n d t h e
Sycophants o n 'the Tale of V i g i n i a
Epitome' a n d ' Noah's Toilet) - don't ask
me what that's all about! There are t w o
CDs on the a l b u m . The first features a
d o z e n or so s u p e r b prog, h o u s e tracks,
whilst the s e c o n d features a n o t h e r six
or so w h i c h y o u can play o n your PC or
on a normal C D player. Both CDs fea-
ture s o m e tracks r e c o r d e d live f r o m
s o m e point of Coldcut's tour. Don't let
the packaging put y o u off either - it
may appear to be a happy hardcore
type a l b u m , but it's not. It is great a n d
any progressive h o u s e fans out there
should get their hands o n a copy o f this
album. O u t n o w o n Ninja Records.

'produced-in-ten-minutes-to-make-a-
fast-buck1
CDs. These CD's (and there
are loads o f them) are the current hits
that have b e e n o n the d a n c e floors in
Greece, Spain etc. Basically, they have
b e e n c h u c k e d together a n d 'mixed' (?)
by DJ Turntables (or whatever their
names are) in less t i m e than it takes for
you to pull o n your holiday, in the h o p e
that as a 'reminder' of your hols, you'll
buy the C D . Obviously if y o u w a n t to
but t h e m t h e n fine, but there are lots
of t h e m a n d c h o o s i n g the right o n e
can often be a pain in the arse since
they're g o i n g to have tracks o n t h e m
w h i c h y o u will hate.
The biggest g r o u p of CD's that c o m e
out are the o n e s that m e n t i o n Iblza in
their names, but o n e g r o u p o f CDs that
are definitely w o r t h c h e c k i n g out, is the
Cafe Del M a r series. There are three of
t h e m in this particular series, a n d Jose
Albums + Singles
Padilla himself (the f a m o u s DJ of the
Cafe Del Mar) has c h o s e n the tracks.
All the music o n the CDs are taken from
the 1992-1996 period a n d the classic
balearic tunes that have s h a p e d Ibiza
into what it is today. In short, these are
tunes that have m a d e Ibiza. All Ihe
originals are here, i n c l u d i n g
S m o k e b e l c h II by the Sabres of
Paradise, A g u a , a n d Jose Padilla the list
g o e s o n a n d o n . The tunes span the
spectrum of the classic Ibizan hits. The
melodies, soft-vocal a n d instrumental
tunes are on, as well as those tunes
with a slight beat a n d the s o u n d of
w a v e s crashing onto the beach, for
those of y o u w h o loved Ibiza a f e w ,
years a g o , then y o u could d o a lot
w o r s e than to check out this collection.
Alright, it is a f e w years old n o w , but if
y o u want a trip d o w n m e m o r y lane,
then check out these.

Single of the Week
Monica
'Inside' (Masters at Work remixes)
O u r single of the w e e k - and what a tunc
it is - is a superb track by M o n i c a w h i c h
features the M A W d o i n g the remixing.
It's a cross b e t w e e n R&B a n d garage,
since it doesn't s e e m to be in either
g e n r e , a n d it's the kind of t u n e y o u
could s m o o c h the night away to. A soft
bass line and Monica's sweet voice make
the vocal mix arguably the best mix, but
there is a stack of mixes to c h o o s e from,
including dubs, a n d a h o u s e mix. M o n -
ica's voice is great and the M A W do a
s u p e r b j o b of giving us a b o u t half a
d o z e n versions thanks to their mixes, giv-
ing plenty of variations. Great vocals,
great tune - superb. Out in M a r c h .

Faith Evans
All night long'
The q u e e n of R&B o n c e again d e m o n -
strates w h y she is just that. All night long
is a w o n d e r f u l track1
, w h i c h features the
a w e s o m e voice of Faith, as well as tune
w h i c h has a great rhythm to it. But y o u
are simply lost in Evans' wonderful vocals
a n d that's w h a t really makes the track.
The single c o m e s with three mixes, the
a l b u m version (which is the best mix), an
Instrumental (alright if y o u like the soft
tune) a n d an aceppella (great if y o u just
want to hear Faith!). The tune features
Puff Daddy and the train spotters might
pick up o n the fact that the track takes
excerpts f r o m 'I hear music in the street'.

Donna Dee
'Hooked'
A close runner for single of the week, it's
a garage t u n e by o n e of the hottest
producers about o n the garage scene at
the m o m e n t . 1998 saw the release of
D o n n a ' s s u p e r b " S p e l l b o u n d " a l b u m ,
a n d in M a r c h o f this year, she'll release
the H o o k e d cut (from the album). The
tune features a very simple, catchy beat
a n d soft vocals, m a k i n g it an ideal
garage tune. Since it's kick up a storm
o n the dancefloors, a lot of people seem
to agree. The C D c o m e s with three
mixes, the best of w h i c h is by the Ruff
Driverz.

Grant Nelson Feat. Jean McClaln
'Step 2 Me'
A g o o d soulful, garage tune featuring
the vocal talents of Jean McClain. Again,
it's a g o o d , simple track - no fancy break-
d o w n s or anything. G o o d vocals, sim-
ple, catchy tune. The track c o m e s with
four mixes, but unfortunately they all
s o u n d exactly the s a m e , with minimal
c h a n g e leaving the variation a bit thin.

Blackout
'Gotta have hope'
Multiply is a record label with a history
of p r o d u c i n g great tracks - apart from
this one. This has to be o n e of the worst
tunes I have ever h e a r d , a n d what's
m o r e plenty of p e o p l e agree (ask the
Chemistry students in the Evans lab!).
The track is simply crap. It kicks off with
a beat that is fine e n o u g h , but w h i c h is
then murdered as a w o m a n starts to ran-
d o m l y scream "gotta have hope". Not
content with that, the producers then
introduce the t h e m e from '2001 A Space
Odyssey', again, c o m p l e t e l y randomly,
! before the w o m a n , o n c e again, starts
| s c r e a m i n g again. The C D c o m e s with
j three mixes, o n e allegedly by J u d g e
I Jules, t h o u g h tragically your ears are
! subjected to exactly the s a m e tune as
the other two mixes. A n awful track,
w h i c h y o u s h o u l d avoid. It's only use is
as a present for s o m e o n e y o u really
hate.
