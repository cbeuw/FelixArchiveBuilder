O u r beloved G a m e s Editor likes to dress
up as Darth Vader - in fact he's rarely hap-
pier than w h e n clad in tight black leather,
with an e n c l o s i n g black m a s k c o v e r i n g
his visage, whilst m a n h a n d l i n g a n enor-
m o u s throbbing w e a p o n . But e n o u g h o f
that...
A n y o n e w h o ' s b e e n in a c o m p u t e r
g a m e s s h o p in t h e last five years (in fact
almost a n y o n e 'of a certain a g e ' w h o
hasn't actually b e e n d e a d for t h e last
five years) will b e familiar with t h e X-
W i n g series. In fact there m a y b e t h o s e
of y o u o u t there t h i n k i n g " H a n g o n ,
these g a m e s have b e e n o u t for at least
three years - w h y t h e hell are they b e i n g
reviewed now?" N o t to put t o o fine a
point o n it, t h e last c o u p l e o f w e e k s
have b e e n rather fallow for PC gamers .
M o s t o f t h e major releases have b e e n
saved for t h e spring schedules, w h i c h
m e a n s that w e have to fill in with c o m -
pilations a n d a certain a m o u n t o f gossip,
fortunately, a c o u p l e o f t h e g a m e s pub-
!khÂ£>rs i mderstand this a n d have released
s o m e rather g o o d compilations to help
us poor PC G a m e r s survive. Blizzard are
o n e (see last issue), a n d Lucasarts (bless
(heft cotton socks) are another.
Lucasarts have re-packaged a n d re-
i eieased all o f their Star Wars g a m e s in
the last m o n t h or so. This m a y not be
itirely u n c o n n e c t e d with t h e f l o o d o f
interest b e i n g generated by t h e
trailer for Episode 1 w h i c h w a s
s h o w i n g at s e l e c t e d c i n e m a s
recently. Most of the games have
b e e n released at budget (or at
least cheaper) prices, a n d in o n e
or t w o cases re-jigged to take
advantage o f minor innovations
such as 3D cards a n d DirectX. In
o n e case s o m e additional (and
exclusive) m i s s i o n s have b e e n put
together solely for this release.
At this point I'd better declare an
interest -1 a m a Star Wars fan. As a kid I
had t h e figures a n d m a n y o f t h e ships.
I'd have t h e m still had my mother not
sold t h e m for a measly five quid. While
I'm not totally blind to t h e faults in the
films (the unnecessarily l o n g dialoguey
bits, Leia's haircuts, Luke Skywalker full-
stop), I shall be a m o n g s t those q u e u i n g
r o u n d the block In the summer, a tenner
in m y d a m p , sweaty palm. I'm looking
forward to it, a n d I'm not a s h a m e d . O h
yes, t h e g a m e s . Right, t h e flight sims, X-
w i n g , Tie f i g h t e r a n d X-Wing vs Tie
fighter, collec-
tively k n o w n
as t h e X-Wing
Trilogy.
X - W i n g
has b e e n
k n o c k i n g
about for quite
s o m e t i m e
n o w . It has the
distinction o f
b e i n g t h e first
g a m e I actually
w e n t out a n d
b o u g h t with m y o w n m o n e y . It's best
s u m m e d u p as t h e best bits f r o m t h e
films - namely the fights. You are (natu-
rally) a rebel starfighter pilot, a n d
get to fly all the ships f r o m t h e
films - X-Wing, Y-Wing, A-Wing
and B-Wing. Broadly speaking the
missions f o l l o w t h e films, a n d
yes, y o u d o get t h e c h a n c e to fly
a l o n g t h e equatorial trench o f
the Death Star - if you're g o o d
e n o u g h . For this release it's b e e n
cleaned u p a bit, t h e graphics in
particular b e i n g upgraded to take advan-
t a g e o f current t e c h n o l o g y . It also
includes t h e t w o e x p a n s i o n packs, a n d
may well be your only c h a n c e o f getting
them. However, despite the upgrade, it's
n o w definitely s h o w i n g its a g e .
Tie f i g h t e r w a s X-Wing's s e q u e l ,
although it's more o f a c o m p a n i o n piece.
O n e o f t h e biggest criticisms levelled at
X-Wing w a s that, particularly o n t h e final
missions, it b e c a m e well nigh impossible.
Tie Fighter addressed this by having three
difficulty settings, e n s u r i n g that e v e n
non-entities like m e could s e e t h e clos-
ing cutscenes. It w a s in every w a y bet-
ter than X-Wing, plus y o u get t h e a d d e d
b o n u s o f flying
for t h e e m p i r e .
The storyline has
also b e e n
i m p r o v e d , with
an intriguing sub-
plot d e a l i n g with
a fifth c o l u m n
w i t h i n t h e
empire. This has
also b e e n
u p g r a d e d
(although not as
m u c h as X-Wing)
and includes the expansion pack. It is the
most e n j o y a b l e o f t h e g a m e s in this
pack, a l t h o u g h n o t by m u c h .
O n e feature that both X-Wing and Tie
Fighter lacked w a s t h e ability to b l o w
your friends into a t h o u s a n d pieces in a
decent multiplayer environment. X-Wing
vs Tie Fighter w a s Lucasarts attempt to
a d d r e s s this p r o b l e m . Y o u c a n fly as
either Imperial or Rebel pilots a n d in
either co-operative or head-to-head play.
The graphics are t h e best o f the three
games, a n d t h e flight control is excellent.
However, t h e g a m e lacked a coherent
set o f missions, a n d so fucasarts released
Balance of Power, a series of pre-planned
single player missions. It w a s only partly
successful, a n d overall, X-wing vs Tie
Fighter w a s not quite as g o o d as Tie
Fighter. For s o m e r e a s o n , Lucasarts
haven't i n c l u d e d Balance o f Power in
this pack (or if they have, they've h i d d e n
it well), instead p l u m p i n g for s o m e extra
"exclusive" missions.
All in all, this is pretty m u c h an essen-
tial purchase if y o u haven't already got
the g a m e s . If y o u have, then y o u have
to m a k e t h e c h o i c e as to w h e t h e r or not
the additional upgrades are worth splash-
ing o u t e v e n m o r e m o n e y . T h e g a m e s
are still a j o y to play of course, a n d these
upgrades will help fill out t h e wait for X-
W i n g : Alliance. They'll also run o n lower
spec m a c h i n e s than R o g u e Squadron,
a n d are (I think) generally better games.

Oh No Not More Previews - LucasArts' X-Wing Alliance
If X-Wing and Tie fighter set the standards
for the space fighter simulator s c e n e , X-
W i n g Vs Tie Fighter d r o p p e d t h e batton,
fell over, a n d then w a n d e r e d off for a kip
behind t h e high j u m p pit. LucasArts tried
to sort out their problem child with a n e w
pair of running shoes (Balance o f Power),
but in a classic case of t o o little t o o late,
the Decent - Freespace t e a m s n e a k e d
into t h e lead.
LucasArts has not given u p that eas-
ily a n d their plans to sprint back into t h e
lead with t h e latest release X-Wing
Alliance a r e a l m o s t c o m p l e t e . Rather
than starting off a fully f l e d g e d Rebel
pilot, y o u start as a lowly character f r o m
the family's Transport business. Here y o u
start by flying transport a n d escort mis-
sions to protect the transports from rivals
a n d their friends in t h e empire. The path
to greatness progresses to t h e secret
A l l i a n c e t r a i n i n g g r o u n d s b e f o r e y o u
finally m a k e it just in time for the battle
against t h e s e c o n d deathstar.
Y o u m i g h t h a v e
realised that this path
involves flying s o m e
n e w craft. Transports
s u c h as t h e Correllian
transports a n d t h e
f a m o u s M i l l e n i u m Fal-
c o n (Yes for o n c e y o u
t o o c a n b e Harrison
Ford).
The g r a p h i c s a n d
s o u n d s i n c e X Vs Tie
h a v e b e e n slightly
c h a r g e d up, but w h a t
will d e c i d e w h e t h e r it m a n a g e s to blast
the o p p o s i t i o n into t h e cold v a c u u m o f
space is t h e single player g a m e play. X
vs Tie w a s a delight to play over a net-
w o r k with a g r o u p o f friends but w a s a
c o m p l e t e pain to play in single person
m o d e . T h e story a n d fifty missions will
help, a n d so w e wait...and wait..and wait.
