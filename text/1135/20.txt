PATRICK CAULFIELD
Hayward Gallery
C
aulfield's still-lives are a contradic-
tion. H i s planar a n d g r a p h i c
images are reminiscent o f c o m i c
strip cells, s w a m p e d in bright, u n i f o r m
and intense colours. Each form is defined
by p r o n o u n c e d black c o n t o u r s ,
m u c h like t h e leading o f stained
glass w i n d o w s (incidentally, also
the subject o f a picture). Yet this
radical simplification is aptly c o m -
p e n s a t e d for by p r o m i n e n t per-
spective guidelines, w h i c h expand
the d i m e n s i o n s o f perception.
" M y subject matter has n o spe-
cific geographical situation, it could
be a n y w h e r e in t h e world. That's
w h y I use certain imagery rather
repetitively, such as pots. G r e e k
pots picked up from t h e s e a b e d
c o u l d have b e e n m a d e last w e e k ,
they are o f a similar form, retain the
s a m e f u n c t i o n a n d a r e equally
c o m p e l l i n g but without a date -
this is the antithesis of t h e Pepsi-
Cola bottle."
His pictures are light-hearted a n d
decorative, often depicting interiors a n d
landscapes. H e also injects insight a n d
h u m o u r into his work, parodying Stubbs
with a horse profile a n d interpreting a
Delacroix c o m p o s i t i o n . H e also juxta-
poses contrasting techniques to great
effect, clashing t h e almost abstract with
excessive photographic realism. A finely
detailed rose or wineglass is t h e
focus o f the c o m p o s i t i o n amidst a
geometric backdrop.
This major retrospective high-
lights Caulfield's distinctive style,
h o w e v e r t h e format o f his w o r k
remains, perhaps disappointingly,
static throughout his distinguished
career, a l t h o u g h in m o r e recent
paintings h e admittedly introduces
the concept of texture to otherwise
rigorously s m o o t h canvases. Cauld-
field enjoys teasing the viewer with
t r o m p e I'oeil r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s o f
matter - an invitation to an obscure
w o r l d o f fantasy issued from t h e
quotidian.

PICASSO AND PHOTOGRAPHY: THE DARK MIRROR
Barbican Art Gallery
T
his exciting exhibition - a c o n d e n s e d
version o f s h o w s f r o m t h e M u s e e
Picasso in Paris - e x p l o r e s Pablo
Picasso's relationship with photography.
The display o p e n s with a f e w classical
Spanish painters; t h e i n f l u e n c e o f El
Greco is highly noticeable, f r o m then o n ,
w e follow Picasso's work, b e g i n n i n g with
his preparation a n d research for t h e rev-
olutionary Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.
He prepared sketches f r o m p h o t o s o f
West African w o m e n taken at t h e b e g i n -
n i n g o f t h e century. This sec-
tion is very beautiful - it's fas-
c i n a t i n g t o discover t h e
m a k i n g o f such an influential
p a i n t i n g . H i s t i m e at t h e
5| Bateau-Lavoir studio in Mont-
X martre d u r i n g 1905-1909 is
t h e n d e p i c t e d , i n c l u d i n g
m a n y pictures o f his friends.
The next collection takes u s
to Horta d e Ebro in Spain
w h e r e he painted the Houses
on the Hill. Again, w e witness
the step by step creation o f
the piece, as h e uses p h o -
tography as his main influ-
e n c e a n d help. The following
r o o m s h o w s a f e w images o f
his o w n art, with an installa-
tion o f papiers colles.
Picasso captures t h e
m o o d a n d spirit o f his time
t h r o u g h p h o t o g r a p h y . H e
t o o k great portraits o f s o m e of the most
prominent artists o f the 1910s: the poets
M a x Jacob a n d Apollinaire (in hospital
w i t h his w a r injuries) as w e l l as t h e
painters f e D o u a n i e r R o u s s e a u a n d
M a r i e Laurencin (a rare contemporary
f e m a l e artists). H e e v e n m a n a g e d t o
record his collaboration with Stravinsky
o n t h e ballet Parade in 1917, for w h i c h
h e p a i n t e d t h e decor. T h e exhibition
then focuses m o r e o n other photogra-
phers' take o n his art a n d his partnership
with s o m e o f t h e m . First, w e s e e D o r a
Maar's series depicting the creation o f
Guernica in 1937. Each photo is taken at
a different stage a n d therefore consti-
tutes a p r e c i o u s d o c u m e n t a t i o n o f
Picasso's artistic technique. Other famous
p h o t o g r a p h e r s include D o i s n e a u a n d
Brassai. Both observed h i m in the inti-
macy of his art. Brassai's pictures s h o w
his inventive paper sculp-
tures of the 1940s. The final
rooms concentrate o n t h e
last 20 years o f the artist's
creative life. First, w e explore
his collaboration with A n d r e
Villers. Picasso u s e d h i s
paper cut-outs a p p r o a c h o n
Villers' photographs, giving
rise to s o m e t r e m e n d o u s l y
innovative pieces. Particu-
larly m e m o r a b l e w a s t h e
cleverly s u p e r i m p o s e d pre-
sentation of palm a n d mask
silhouettes. The last r o o m is
yet another original creation
- light or space images using
light bulbs, with Picasso
drawing a n d the photogra-
pher Gjon Mill capturing t h e
m o v e m e n t s .
Photography w a s always
a major element in Picasso's
artistic career a n d personal
life. W e g e t a delightful
insight into his captivating
world, so I strongly r e c o m m e n d this to all
Picasso lovers.
