The S t u d e n t s ' N e w s p a p e r at I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
Dobson on Health at IC
The candid Secretary of State for Health,
Frank Dobson, delivered a n even-handed,
self-effacing speech to a particularly well
attended meeting of the ICU Labour Soci-
ety on Thursday 28 January. From the out-
set he warned the receptive audience that
his public speaking w a s so soporific that it
had been known to send h i m to sleep
while he was making the speeches. M a i n -
taining this light-hearted tone h e quoted
h o w one national paper had characterised
his i n c o n g r u e n c e with t h e re-vamped
Labour Party: "He is to N e w Labour what
the Norweigian entry is t h e Furovision
s o n g contest."
Mr Dobson used his time to focus o n
the current stability a n d future prospects o f
the NHS, introducing the topic by describ-
ing the values underpinning "the most
popular institution in Britain by a very con-
siderable distance". Describing its "quality
and equality", he contended that its success
a n d incomparable c o n v e n i e n c e w e r e
derived from it being purely tax-funded,
and went o n to state the Government's
responsibility to the system "is to try to
make sure the things that are w r o n g with
the Health Service - and there are things

wrong with it - are put
righl a n d it is placed
in a position w h e r e it
can c o p e with the
various challenges
and changes of the
c o m i n g century."
The Health Sec-
retary then launched
an attack o n h o w |

such as the popula-

the N H S of t h e
future. H e insisted that the demographics
of the population indicated there can only
be an ease in the current strain o n the sys-
tem.
"To put the N H S
in a position w h e r e it
can cope with admit-
tedly new challenges,"
was h o w M r D o b s o n
assessed his current
role. To this end there
w o u l d n e e d to b e

in the system, a n d a

ronment. A b o v e all

tive measures meted
to those w h o are at
fault, h e e x p o u n d e d the virtues of ensur-
ing a high quality service from the outset.
The required standard of education a n d
training could b e achieved "by t h e sys-
tematic spread of best practice a n d the
monitoring o f that best practice."
The Cabinet Minister ended his speech
by o p e n i n g the floor to questions, where-
u p o n he was subjected to a forthright and
salient session of questioning. In answer
to the claim that the NHS survives o n a vast
amount of overtime put in by doctors, M r
D o b s o n agreed that the system is main-
tained by the hard work of all NHS staff. H e
remarked that h e in fact had a n appoint-
ment with t h e Prime Minister later that
day w h e r e he would discuss a pay increase
for medical staff next week. H e also pre-
sented the o p p o s i n g view, claiming h e
often spoke to members of the medical fra-
ternity w h o c o m p l a i n e d that there col-
leagues did not w o r k hard e n o u g h , to
which he w o u l d reply "you know w h o they
are, you d o s o m e t h i n g about it."
The Secretary o f State later found it
necessary t o qualify his stance o n the
selective administration of drugs, in par-
ticular t h e controversial Viagra. H e
reminded people that "it's the National
Health Service not t h e National Recre-
ational Service."
Chelsea Lose at Harlington
