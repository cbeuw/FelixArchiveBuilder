BUSA CUP SHOCKER!
Brunei I 0 - 2 IC I
Just in case n o o n e knows, Brunei w o n
t h e w h o l e c o m p e t i t i o n J a s t year a n d
w e r e favourites to w i n a g a i n . Until
W e d n e s d a y that w a s w h e n they c a m e
across the mighty IC first XI.
Led by our captain Jamie, playing in o d d
boots, IC put together a p e r f o r m a n c e
that will b e talked a b o u t for years to
c o m e . Regardless o f t h e fact that t h e
keeper, Eric, w a s urinating in t h e goal
and various t e a m m e m b e r s w e r e clearly
unprepared five mins before kick-off. IC
c a m e through with a heroic effort.
In the first half Brunei e n j o y e d s o m e
g o o d p o s s e s s i o n but lacked ideas o f
few to break d o w n t h e IC back line o f
Phil, So-so, chris a n d Rich.
In t h e s e c o n d half IC w e r e b e g i n n i n g to
get a lot m o r e o f t h e ball a n d c a m e
close to taking t h e lead t h r o u g h N a k
and Warren. W e finally broke t h e d e a d -
lock, Dave latched o n to a loose ball in
midfield a n d e x p l o d e d t h r o u g h t h e back
four to s m a s h t h e ball h o m e .
Clearly a n n o y e d by this, Brunei started to
throw caution to t h e w i n d a n d this gave
IC a n opportunity t o break " M a n U t d "
style.
Alex d o u b l e d our lead with about 15
minutes left. Jamie slotted a ball through
to h i m a n d Alex finished it off Spanish
style.
Brunei, w h o w e r e n o w livid with the
w h o l e situation, t h r e w forward every-
thing they h a d but IC w e r e d e t e r m i n e d
not to c r u m b l e a n d held out for a well
deserved victory.
SCOREBOARD
IC I 6 - 1 QMW I (ULU CUP)
W e started off in a sportingly b a d style
gifting t h e m (with t h e h e l p o f t h e
umpires) a n early 1 - 0 lead. This g e n -
erous habit o f giving t h e m t h e ball reg-
ularly c o n t i n u e d for t h e next 20 mins
until 11 + d e c i d e d to humiliate t h e o p p o -
sition keeper by scoring from a n obscure
angle. S o m e of the u m p i r i n g w a s poor,
but in the e n d skill prevailed. After 11 +
scored, Blue u n d e r p a n t s put a n o t h e r
goal in, m a k i n g it 2 - 1 at half time.
The s e c o n d half started as t h e first
half h a d finished with IC scoring t w o
m o r e quality goals, o n e by Pink G a s h
ICI118-0 Essex 2nd XI
C o m e o n !
The boys took to the field of dreams
u n a w a r e o f t h e challenge that awaited
t h e m . With 8 internationals a n d 11
national league I players Essex University
lis were a t e a m to b e reckoned with. But
reckon with t h e m w e d i d - a n d over-
c a m e their skill a n d fitness with 18 qual-
ity goals (even o n e from captain Jean
C l a u d e w h o is shit!) Bring o n Milton
