DREAM CITY FILM CLUB
In The Cold Light Of Morning,
Despite the fluffy name, one
band member still Insists on
looking like a menace.
T
his a l b u m is d e p r e s s i n g . If
you're l o o k i n g for s o m e t h i n g to
perk y o u u p in t h e m o r n i n g , t o
lift y o u u p w h e n you're feeling low,
don't look here. This is m o r e likely t o
s e n d y o u scuttling t o a dark corner
w h e r e y o u will want to w a l l o w in a pit o f
your o w n despair a n d insecurities. T h e
music in general has G o t h s t a m p e d all
over it. It's dark, pervy a n d m o r o s e .
Having said that, Dream City film
Club have let u p a little since their epony-
m o u s first a l b u m . That w a s a harsh a n d
depraved look at m o d e r n life, described
in t h e press as ' a discordant blob o f
s o n i c g r e a s e ' a n d ' a filthy sore o f a
record,' as well as 'pretty fucking horri-
ble, all told,' by t h e N M E . For this, their
s e c o n d album, there is less emphasis o n
grating r a w n e s s a n d m o r e o f their
m e l o d i e s a n d sensitivities c a n s h i n e
t h r o u g h .
The a l b u m o p e n s with t h e beauti-
fully poignant Killer Blow. It's quiet a n d
thoughtful, a n d h e n c e totally uncharac-
teristic o f the rest o f the a l b u m . M o s t o f
the songs are loud a n d raucous, with an
emphasis o n s o u n d i n g like a live record-
ing. Bizarrely, Track 9 Country Paranoia
has exactly the s a m e intro as Killer Blow.
M a y b e they could only think u p o n e
quiet bit a n d s o h a d to use it again.
Kerrang! M a g a z i n e voted Billy Chic
single o f the w e e k a n d it's easy to s e e
w h y with its p u n c h y power chords a n d
hard rhythm d r u m m i n g .
Singer M i c h a e l J. Sheehy's voice is
surprisingly dynamic a n d aptly suited for
this style o f music. H e often sails f r o m a
pathetic w h i n e to a full o n croon. S o m e -
times it can- s o u n d l e e r i n g a n d c o n -
temptuous, at other times frail. Guest
vocalist Victoria Benjamin adds a pleas-
antly contrasting tone o n several tracks.
There are s o m e great s o n g s here,
but not e n o u g h . D C f C could b e a great
band if they just stopped trying to b e so
d a m n grim the w h o l e time. EJ

SLY AND ROBBIE
Drum And Bass Strip To The Bone By Howie B
Sly and Robbie - back again.
A
pparently, Sly a n d Robbie have
released a ridiculously large
n u m b e r o f a l b u m s over t h e last
f e w years a n d apart f r o m their classic
single Fire, all this progress s e e m s to
have passed m e by. However, prior t o
the release o f their latest offering Strip
to the Bone, I w a s eagerly awaiting t h e
tunes to b e offered. The reason for this
can b e g u e s s e d f r o m t h e title, for it w a s
s u p p o s e d t o b e a d r u m a n d bass remix
a l b u m o f the d u o ' s w o r k by music m a n
extraordinaire H o w i e B.
The s o u n d o f Strip to the Bone is,
however, far from what I expected t o
hear. Rather than t h e scripted d r u m
and bass, Strip to the Bone has a definite
d u b s o u n d t o it. Still, this w a s probably
the most likely o u t c o m e w h e n it is con-
sidered that t h e a l b u m w a s m a d e In
Jamaica, with Sly a n d Robbie supplying
their remix chief with, as H o w i e himself
put it, 'extra strong w e e d . ' T h e bass Is
not entirely missing but the pace is slow
- o n e could say it's perfect for sitting back
a n d chilling out with a joint to. N o sur-
prises there, then.
As for m y favourite tracks, the tunes
o n the a l b u m w o r k to c o m p l i m e n t each
other a n d as such, track titles are mere
formalities as the music w a s h e s through
the atmosphere. T h e a l b u m also turns
out t o b e great music to g o to sleep to,
- more proof that this is far from d r u m
and bass.
So, all In all, the s o u n d o f Strip to the
Bone isn't really Sly a n d Robbie a n d it
isn't really Howie B. But I s u p p o s e that's
what should b e expected w h e n transat-
lantic music giants with such contrasting
styles meet. Not brilliant, but definitely
worth a listen. El
