Specimen A Review + Competition Winners!
Review: Specimen A @ IC Union
Last Friday s a w the s e c o n d g i g by Spec-
imen A at our u n i o n , a n d w h a t a success
it was. Their u n i q u e brand of aggressive
punk, a n d Prodigy-sounding tunes h a d
the 'floor p a c k e d out (it h a d to b e really,
since it was a sell out).
But a l t h o u g h IC has s e e n S p e c i m e n
A play twice, not m a n y p e o p l e k n o w
w h o they are. C l u b s c e n e m a n a g e d to
get an interview with t h e m b e f o r e t h e
gig.
So w h o are they? Well, S p e c i m e n A
are a c o u p l e of likely lads (brothers actu-
ally) w h o write, p r o d u c e a n d play the
kind of music that they w a n t to. Pretty
g o o d w h e n y o u take into a c c o u n t that
they are only 18 a n d 20 years o l d .
Their debut a l b u m , called Pulse, was
written in a year a n d fuses together sev-
eral genres o f music: hip h o p , d r u m a n d
bass, heavy techno, a n d trance - a rather
simple system of p r o d u c i n g tracks that
they like the s o u n d of. AI the m o m e n t ,
they are just building up their reputation,
so by playing a f e w gigs (a tour is d u e
soon), a n d a bit of radio play will set
t h e m o n the road to stardom. A l t h o u g h
the c o m p a r i s o n s to the Prodigy will be
m a d e , the guys are l o o k i n g to get away
f r o m that type of music - they want to be
k n o w n for their o w n brand of "aggressive
punk" a n d not as rip-offs of Flint et al.
This year, they w o u l d love to do Glas-
tonbury, or s o m e other festival a n d per-
haps even support s o m e o n e (Cypress Hill
was a n a m e m e n t i o n e d a f e w times) o n
tour, thus building up their profile a n d
getting s o m e m u c h n e e d e d publicity.
A n d with their great live shows, includ-
ing d r u m m e r s , guitarists, dancers (their
roadie!), S p e c i m e n A are g o i n g for a
"visually active, live s o u n d with plenty of
vocals and lots of synths". Ideal for a fes-
tival such as Glastonbury.
They are also getting lots of support
f r o m family a n d friends. Their dad has
b e e n o n several w o r l d tours b e f o r e
(Specimen A did not m e n t i o n w h o with
or w h a t he did), but the e x p e r i e n c e
counts. Their d a d also h a p p e n s to m a n -
age them, whilst m u m is a music teacher
(runs in the family?) and helps o n the cos-
t u m e front. For each s h o w , S p e c i m e n A
bring a h u g e a m o u n t of equipment, a n d
it's all theirs, so bank loans a n d all that
rubbish is really a p r o b l e m , all they have
to do is p r o d u c e the g o o d s . Recently,
they s i g n e d to the record giants B M G ,
w h o will release Pulse a n d the first sin-
gle in the next c o u p l e of months, s h o w -
ing that S p e c i m e n A arc a band to be
taken seriously.
Obviously this year will be crucial,
they n e e d publicity, a n d they can't afford
to let the a l b u m flop - not that it should,
given the backing of B M G . If everything
g o e s to plan, S p e c i m e n A will be a r o u n d
for s o m e time - a n d w e saw t h e m first!

Return to the Source
The Rocket, Holloway Road, N7.
Saturdays, £8/£9/£12,
10pm-6am, capacity -1,200.
Dress code - none.
"It's all a load of tree-hugging hippy crap",
as Cartman f r o m South Park w o u l d say.
That is Return to the Source for y o u . You
seriously h a v e to b e into this sort o f
thing to enjoy this night. A n d I wasn't,
and probably never have b e e n , e v e n in
my more o p e n - m i n d e d travelling days.
That's 'cos (and I'll be blunt) the music
was a b s o l u t e l y shit. W h e r e w a s t h e
swirling, dreamy, psychedelic trance usu-
ally associated with RTFS (just check out
s o m e of their a l b u m s for this)? That's
w h a t RTFS really is a b o u t . Or m a y b e
they've m o v e d on to n e w a n d shitter pas-
tures. The only way to desctlbe the music
in the main a r e n a is as m i n d - n u m b i n g .
This stuff really m a d e your brain hurt - the
dance music equivalent o f thrash metal.
To derive any e n j o y m e n t f r o m this, let
alone b e i n g able to d a n c e to it, y o u
would have to have taken e n o u g h s p e e d
to kill a horse. There was just n o t h i n g to
it - no m e l o d y to speak of, n o t h i n g to
latch o n t o . Just d e a f e n i n g kick d r u m s
a n d a lot of swaying bodies. I think this
music w o u l d have pissed m e off even o n
a p a r a d i s e b e a c h in G o a . A n d w h a t
m a k e s this even m o r e of a s h a m e is
that the venue, The Rocket, is quite g o o d
a n d to be fair to RTFS they did decorate
it well. I think it's a student union by day,
so it's a bit angular a n d functional in
places, but it does the job as a major club
v e n u e . The RTTS p e o p l e are also great.
Very chilled-out, friendly, happy, a n d
most certainly not scary. But c l u b b i n g is
not just about these things - it's primar-
ily about the music, and o n this funda-
mental criterion RTTS failed miserably
last Saturday. But I'm not g o i n g to say
never go there, because maybe I caught
RTTS o n a bad night. It was a d r u m m i n g
festival o n the night, so every fucker and
his wife had a b o n g o drum on them. And
I m e a n even/one. I actually felt quite
n a k e d w i t h o u t - I s h o u l d have taken
m i n e a l o n g with m e . Then m a y b e I'd
have got m o r e into it. But I doubt it. You
see b o n g o d r u m s are great w h e n there
is only a f e w of t h e m b e i n g played by
highly skilled performers, as an a c c o m -
paniment to the music. That's w h e n they
a d d an extra d i m e n s i o n to a club night.
But this was b o n g o drum hell. O n e r o o m
was even wholly dedicated to the little
cylindrical fellas. Imagine well over a
h u n d r e d tone-deaf, u n t a l e n t e d , a n d
u n c o o r d i n a t e d crusties trying to play (!)
their d r u m s in time with e a c h other.
Obviously they failed, but m o r e impor-
tantly they drove anyone foolish e n o u g h
to stay in the r o o m , completely m a d .
A n d what's m o r e they used up a w h o l e
r o o m w h i c h could have b e e n filled with
the h y p n o t i c Goa-trancc that RTTS is
f a m o u s for.
However, don't just take my w o r d for
all of this. Listen to o n e of their a l b u m s
a n d if y o u like w h a t y o u hear then give
the club night a go. But r e m e m b e r not
to take your b o n g o d r u m with y o u . After
all, clubs arc for d a n c i n g in, not for
p o u n d i n g away incessantly o n annoy-
ing instruments.
