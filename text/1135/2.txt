Debt Decreases Your Health: Official
Disturbing n e w research to be published
in The Psychologist shows that students
are twice as likely to suffer f r o m ill health
and reduced mental well-being as their
contemporaries w h o are not at university.
The study by Dr Ron Roberts, a psychol-
ogist at the University of Westminster, has
confirmed w h a t most students'already
feel - that there is a clear link b e t w e e n ris-
ing levels o f debt a m o n g students a n d
the comparatively lower levels o f health.
In 'Student Finance a n d M e n t a l Health',
a paper co-authored with colleagues Dr
John G o l d i n g a n d Dr Tony Towell, Dr
Roberts presents t h e results o f t h e study
carried out at t w o L o n d o n universities
(one old a n d t h e other new).
Unsurprisingly, Dr Roberts f o u n d that
students' general health, assessed o n
the basis o f physical vitality a n d psycho-
logical a n d social functioning, w a s "sub-
stantially worse than that o f y o u n g people
of the equivalent a g e a n d sex in t h e g e n -
eral population". H e linked this to stu-
dents' w o r k i n g for longer hours in order
to make e n d s . m e e t . It w a s f o u n d that
those students surveyed considering t h e
a b a n d o n m e n t o f their studies w e r e g e n -
erally likely to suffer f r o m poorer health,
both physically a n d mentally.
The study also revealed that students

in debt w e r e m o r e likely than others to
k n o w other students w h o were involved
in prostitution, d r u g dealing a n d criminal
activities in order to bolster their financial
state. Dr Roberts c o n c l u d e s that "stu-
dents w e r e o n average twice as likely to
be in poor health w h e n c o m p a r e d to
[sic] non-students o f t h e s a m e sex a n d
age".
This study c o m e s as the Government
a n n o u n c e d o n 29 January that tuition
fees w o u l d g o u p in line with inflation to
a m a x i m u m o f £1,025 for the a c a d e m i c
year 1999/2000. Figures f r o m t h e Uni-
versities a n d Colleges A d m i s s i o n s Ser-
vice (UCAS) also reveal that t h e n u m b e r
of applications f r o m mature students has
fallen sharply for the second year running
following the introduction o f tuition fees.
Baroness Blackstone, the Education
a n d E m p l o y m e n t Minister, has
a n n o u n c e d a n e w s c h e m e d e s i g n e d to
help part-time students. From the autumn
of next year, part-time students in higher
education o n a l o w i n c o m e will be enti-
tled to loans o f at least £500. With over
2 8 % o f current students b e i n g part-time,
30 million p o u n d s have b e e n allocated to
support the n e w loan s c h e m e over its first
two years.
A l a r m i n g levels o f student poverty
w e r e highlighted in a Times Higher Edu-
cation S u p p l e m e n t poll revealing that
three-quarters o f non-first year students
have cut back o n buying clothes, s h o e s
or f o o d . Almost a quarter have cut back
on book-buying, m o r e than four in t e n
students w o r k during term-time (more
than half o f these w o r k in bars); what's
worrying is that over 3 0 % o f these w o r k
m o r e than t h e official r e c o m m e n d a t i o n
of a m a x i m u m o f fifteen hours a w e e k .
Research previously published by Glas-
g o w Caledonian a n d Paisley Universities
a n d t h e Scottish L o w Pay Unit h a d
demonstrated that the l o n g hours a n d
l o w pay w e r e having a serious impact o n
the a c a d e m i c performance o f students.
This has also b e e n confirmed in research
by Lindsey B o w e s a n d S u e M o o n o f t h e
University o f Central England.
A s p o k e s w o m a n for t h e C o m m i t t e e
of Vice-Chancellors a n d Principals c o m -
m e n t e d that it w a s "each student's per-
sonal responsibility" to strike t h e right
b a l a n c e b e t w e e n part-time w o r k a n d
studies. "Harship funds are available. Stu-
dents in financial difficulties s h o u l d seek
advice f r o m the support services".
