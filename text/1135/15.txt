n o w n to Q M a g a z i n e readers as
'the u n r e m a r k a b l e 3 C o l o u r s
Red' this four-piece p u n k rock
band release their s e c o n d a l b u m Revolt
today. M o s t o f y o u will have heard o f
t h e m thanks to their recent Top 20 hit
a n d breakthrough single Beautiful Day
However, this s o n g is unrepresentative
of t h e a l b u m , w h o s e tracks are far
r e m o v e d from the string-laden rock bal-
lad.
they f o r m e d in 1995, based o n the
songwriting partnership o f singer a n d
bassist Pete Vuckovic a n d guitarist Chris
McCormack. The pair used to write songs
together via post before they had even
met and they happily boast that they
had f o r m e d a prolific partnership before
even setting eyes o n each other. O n
realising their songwriting potential they
enlisted guitarist Ben Harding a n d d r u m -
mer Keith Baxter to form a band. They
called themselves 3 Colours Red after the
critically a c c l a i m e d French film. They
released This Is My Hollywood i n d e p e n -
dently in 1996 a n d s o o n attracted record
label attention, eventually signing to Cre-
ation by the e n d of the year.
Never-ending tours a n d the release
of four singles and an a l b u m s o o n m a d e
t h e m k n o w n across the country but their
music was never accessible or original
e n o u g h for mainstream success. They
tried harder for their next a l b u m , realis-
ing that s o m e slower, m o r e m e l o d i c
s o n g s w o u l d m a k e a w e l c o m e break
f r o m the non-stop hurricane of rock a n d
punk. They gave us the single Paralyse
last October w h i c h the band describes as
'like n o t h i n g w e ' v e d o n e before, think
Pantera a n d The Pixies with a G e o r g e
H a r r i s o n m e l o d y . ' Q u i t e a n accurate
description, except for the Harrison bit.
O h , a n d the m e l o d y bit as well. Unfor-
tunately, the track is the s a m e as all their
previous songs - loud guitars a n d drums,
g r u n g e v o i c e - just with different words.
W h i c h is w h a t can b e said for t h e
majority o f s o n g s o n this a l b u m , o n e ter-
rible s o n g seamlessly rolling into another.
H o w e v e r , t h e r e a r e a c o u p l e that
d e m a n d a s e c o n d listen.
first o f f is Back To The City which
mixes J o h n n y Rotten vocals with comical
early '80's electric rock, not as bad as if
s e e m s actually. T h e n w e have a rare
slow s o n g in This is My Time w h i c h is a
s t a n d a r d orchestrally-enhanced rock
a n t h e m , despite it starting like Spandau
Ballet.
That leaves us finally with current sin-
gle Beautiful Day. It's hard to tell whether
this s o n g will help or hinder them. Whilst
it will o p e n t h e m u p t o a mainstream
audience, it could ruin their image as the
hard boys o f rock. 3 Colours Red are
that rarest o f things, a band that m a n -
a g e s t o o c c a s i o n a l l y create p o w e r f u l
uplifting s o n g s but equally as many crap
ones, unable to separate the g o o d f r o m
the bad. A bit like their record c o m p a n y
Creation, w h o for every Oasis they also
sign a 3 Colours Red. H

DESERT EAGLE DISCS
The Eagle Has Landed
I
was h a n d e d this CD, c o m p l e t e with
the n o w obligatory Parental Advisory
sticker with a rough outline o f t h e
s o u n d : 'Well, it's sort o f R'n'B.' Right-oh
then... I'm probably not the best ambas-
sador for the n e w R'n'B (because didn't
there used t o b e a n old one? Y'know,
like Jools Holland a n d his Rhythm a n d
Blues Orchestra play), considering that
my music collection is what most p e o -
ple w o u l d term 'guitar music' with t h e
o d d splash o f 01' Blue Eyes and a help-
ing o f Korn.
Well, here w e go. The main musi-
cians in the g r o u p are Syze-Up a n d Shari
J. Jules (okay so far) a n d y o u might have
heard of Syze-Up before if you're famil-
iar with Puff Daddy's Bad Boy label. H e
has released a f e w remixes o n it a n d has
also w o r k e d with several stateside artists.
Right, that's e n o u g h of w h o they are - on
to the shiny CD. That's w h y I like CDs -
y o u c a n m a k e pretty patterns o n t h e
ceiling with t h e m using a simple desk
lamp a n d your h a n d .
The chief thing that I (a novice to the
w o r l d s o f R'n'B, rap a n d hip-hop, o f
w h i c h I a m reliably Informed that this is
an amalgam) noticed is that all the songs
c o m e f r o m the s a m e formula. They start
with a rock-steady rhythm section (no fills
if possible, please), f o l l o w e d b y a n
e n e m a i n d u c i n g bass, a s a m p l e or two
and lyrics with plenty of not so vague sex-
ual references a n d m e t a p h o r s . W h i l e
this is n o t necessarily a b a d t h i n g , I
expect s o m e t h i n g a little m o r e varied
f r o m m y music. Having said that, t h e
a l b u m as a w h o l e is a very m e l l o w affair
laced with the aforementioned elements
to g o o d effect.
This is a special type o f music and I
shall attempt t o set the s c e n e in w h i c h
it may b e listened to. You c o m e h o m e
after b e i n g out (a club, the pub, what-
ever) and It's late. You might b e with
s o m e friends or a laydee or a bloke, but
I have experience with t h e former s o
we'll stick with that. You go to the stereo
a n d put s o m e t u n e s o n . That's the style,
it's b a c k g r o u n d , incidental music or, for
want o f a better phrase, it's s h a g g i n g
music. Thai's w h a t D.E.D. is a first class
c h o i c e for but it doesn't flick my switch,
float my boat, y'know. A n d The Lovers is
the s a m e s o n g as Would You kill For Me?
but without the naughty swearing. You
can't fool m e -1 k n o w . E l
