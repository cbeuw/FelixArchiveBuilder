AFRICA BY AFRICA: A PHOTOGRAPHIC VIEW
Barbican Art Gallery
T
his s h o w e x p l o r e s t h e w o r k o f
African photographers f r o m t h e past
70 years. The first display dates back
to the 1930s, portraying n u m e r o u s f a m -
ilies. M o s t o f t h e i m a g e s represent tra-
ditional aspects o f African life; t h e inside
o f houses, w o m e n in typical c o s t u m e s
and couples dressed up for special o c c a -
sions. T h e next s e c t i o n p r e s e n t s a n
incredible a m o u n t o f portraits by M a m a
Casset, A z a g l o a n d Keita. A z a g l o places
his m o d e l s o u t d o o r s , u s i n g m e n a n d
w o m e n alike. Keita, o n t h e other h a n d ,
c o m e s u p with a bril-
liant self-portrait, always
picturing groups or sub-
jects lying d o w n . H i s
funniest piece has to be
the t w o babies (pic-
tured left). These pho-
tos are t o u c h i n g a n d
very m o v i n g . The next

W e get to s e e a y o u n g
a n d charismatic N e l s o n M a n d e l a , lots of
d a n c i n g a n d singing in jazz clubs as well
as a rare, early p h o t o g r a p h of the great-
est African singer, M i r i a m M a k e b a . The
70s are typified as g l a m o r o u s partying,
revealing the influence o f Pop culture o n
Africa. S a m u e l Fosso's series captures
the spirit o f this turbulent decade. He has
t a k e n several t r e m e n d o u s l y intense,
h u m o r o u s a n d original self-portraits. H e
is dressed differently in every single pic-
ture - it looks like a fashion shoot really.
The exhibition s e e m s to skip the 80s a n d
w e land instead in t h e m o d e r n i s m a n d
wildness o f t h e 90s. Both sections are
outstanding. First, A p a g y a creates a set
of studio portraits against different back-
drops, even providing t h e gallery with
o n e . W e therefore get a n idea o f t h e
effects created by p h o t o g r a p h y from a
very basic piece o f e q u i p m e n t . The last
part o f t h e exhibition is d e d i c a t e d t o
contemporary South African photogra-
phers, with a t r e m e n d o u s variety o f work
o n display. M o f o k e n g ' s series has a very
mystic a n d haunting feeling to it. Tsha-
bangu shows the harder
side o f life in the t o w n -
ships. Finally, M t h e t h w a
injects a lot o f c o l o u r
into his photos, result-
ing in a splendidly happy
a n d optimistic outlook.
This s h o w is very
inspiring. It discloses
m a n y facets o f Africa -
the contrasting hardship
and enjoyment. W e also
discover that s o m e
artists a r e p u s h i n g
b o u n d a r i e s , p r o d u c i n g
very original a n d cre-
ative work. It is a great
s h a m e that these artists don't get more
attention in o u r W e s t e r n culture. The
e x h i b i t i o n is definitely w o r t h s e e i n g ,
especially if you don't k n o w m u c h about
African artists. Y o u will discover a world
full o f poetry.

about s e e i n g t h e glittery children's spec-
tacle that is Cinderella. Well, okay, there
was o n e attraction - o n e o f m y all-time

more than m a d e up for t h e sad lack o f

while trying to f e n d off inquisitive prods

a horde o f small children, I s q u e e z e d
myself into the pint-sized chair. I w a s
however d e t e r m i n e d t o k e e p a n o p e n

O n c e t h e play got started t h o u g h , I
was captivated. The sets w e r e consis-
tently breathtaking, a n d perfectly f a n -
tastical, w h i l e t h e c o s t u m e s w e r e
extravagant, inventive and, in t h e case o f
the t w o ugly sisters, often ridiculous a n d
hilarious.
As a p e r s o n w i t h w h a t c o u l d b e

of humour, I f o u n d myself creasing u p at

As with all pantomimes, the children

of t h e show, giving us all an excuse t o
indulge ourselves as well as t h e m . A n d

Incidentally, Kriss didn't let m e d o w n
either - he w a s witty, a n d o f course very
enthusiastic. His c o m p l e t e lack o f any
singing ability w a s cleverly m a s k e d , a n d
his role in 'Record Breakers' w a s milked
to t h e full, providing t h e subject for a
range o f jokes.
O n t h e w h o l e , t h e music w a s a little
corny a n d not very original, using songs
lifted f r o m several well-known musicals.
There w e r e h o w e v e r s o m e m e m o r a b l e
tunes as well as s o m e excellent dances.
The h u n t i n g s c e n e in particular stands
out as a lively, well c h o r e o g r a p h e d a n d
feverishly dramatic piece o f work.

wonderfully capturing t h e fantasy of the

belatedly). A great laugh. But you'll have
to wait until next year to s e e It... Sorry!
