NFL SEASON REVIEW 1998-9
by Chiron Mukherjee
The Superbowl, t h e largest a n n u a l sporting event in t h e
world, c a p p e d o f f o n e o f t h e most exciting seasons o f
NFL football in recent years. A s is s o often t h e case,
Superbowl 33, played in M i a m i , w a s a d i s a p p o i n t i n g
anti-climax. T h e Denver Broncos, t h e retaining c h a m -
pions a n d strong favourites, comfortably d e f e a t e d t h e
surprise N F C C h a m p i o n s , t h e Atlanta Falcons.
Denver started t h e s e a s o n in t r e m e n d o u s f o r m .
They just kept w i n n i n g a n d Terrell Davis, t h e r u n n i n g
back, just kept rushing. For most o f the s e a s o n t h e talk
was about w h e t h e r Denver c o u l d match t h e 7 2 M i a m i
Dolphins as t h e only t e a m s t o w i n every m a t c h o f t h e
season. They b e c a m e only t h e third t e a m in t h e history
of the NFL to g o 13-0 (13 wins, 0 losses) a n d a thrilling
match w a s in anticipation o n t h e penultimate w e e k o f
the regular s e a s o n at... M i a m i . However, in t h e m a t c h
before this (the 14th g a m e ) Denver surprisingly lost t o
the N e w York Giants. They did lose t o M i a m i as well,
and for a while Denver lost their t i m e in t h e spotlight.
But, they destroyed all o p p o s i t i o n in t h e playoffs, beat-
ing t h e N e w York Jets in t h e AFC C h a m p i o n s h i p match,
and w i n n i n g their s e c o n d successive S u p e r b o w l . T h e
main factor for their success w a s t h e f o r m o f Terrell
Davis. M a n y believe h e could b e c o m e t h e greatest run-
ning back ever, a n d h e c o n f i r m e d this by w i n n i n g t h e
league M V P award (basically Player o f t h e Year). For
almost t h e w h o l e s e a s o n Davis w a s in sight o f t h e
record for yards rushed in o n e season (held by Eric Dick-
erson ). A l t h o u g h h e m i s s e d this, h e d i d b e c o m e only
the fourth player to rush for 2000 yards in o n e s e a s o n
(the others a r e D i c k e r s o n , O.J. S i m p s o n a n d Barry
Sanders (last year)), with a n incredible average o f five

yards per carry. The other big story relating Denver w a s
their veteran quarterbackjohn Elway, o n e of the all-time
greats. Although he w a s injured for parts of the season,
a n d w a s not in his best f o r m w h e n fit, his presence as
a talisman w a s important. His display in t h e Superbowl
earned h i m t h e M V P award with over 300 yards pass-
ing, o n e thrown t o u c h d o w n a n d o n e personal t o u c h -
d o w n . It w a s felt that h e w a s g o i n g to retire at the e n d
of this season (as it a p p e a r e d last season too) but after
his match w i n n i n g p e r f o r m a n c e , it is increasingly likely
that h e will
The Atlanta Falcons, could n o t have b e e n a m o r e
unlikely choice as S u p e r b o w l contenders t w o seasons
a g o , a n d e v e n this s e a s o n n o o n e c o u l d have pre-
dicted their success. This s e a s o n s o u n d s like a typical
corny H o l l y w o o d sports m o v i e . A t e a m that has b e e n
the joke t e a m in t h e l e a g u e since their formation, with
a team full of plucky rejects (Chris 'chandelier' Chandler,
their pro-bowl quarterback has played for 6 NFL teams;
Jamal A n d e r s o n , t h e 2 n d best r u n n i n g back in t h e
league w a s a 7th round draft pick) a n d underrated pro-
fessionals defied t h e o d d s t o beat t h e San Franciso
49ers twice. They also beat t h e M i n n e s o t a Vikings, t h e
best t e a m in t h e league with only o n e previous defeat,
in M i n n e s o t a , f r o m b e h i n d . Their h e a d coach (Dan
Reeves) u n d e r g o e s a q u a d r u p l e heart bypass opera-
tion after a g a m e a n d c o m e s back only a f e w w e e k s
later. D a n Reeves c o a c h e d t h e Denver Broncos to
three S u p e r b o w l defeats in t h e 1980s, a n d fired M i k e
S h a n a h a n (the current Denver coach) for insubordina-
tion, before b e i n g sacked himself h e l p e d by pressure
from John Elway. The charismatic 'Dirty Birds', as the Fal-
c o n s call themselves, l o o k e d set to a 'surprise' victory
in this story. However, t h e plot t o o k a n 18-rated twist
w h e n t h e night b e f o r e Super Sunday, E u g e n e 'the
Prophet' Robinson, t h e Atlanta safety, upstanding fam-
ily Christian m a n a n d t h e w i n n e r o f a n award for t h e
most moral football player only a f e w hours earlier, w a s
arrested for soliciting a n undercover p o l i c e w o m a n for

f o r m e d well b e l o w their capability a n d Robinson m a d e
the error which gave Denver an 80-yard t o u c h d o w n that
effectively sealed t h e m a t c h before half-time.
