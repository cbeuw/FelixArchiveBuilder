Selective Reporting
Whilst w e appreciate that sports reports
are only received b y Felix o n a W e d n e s -
day night, a n d m a y be 'edited for length',
w e didn't realise that m e a n t e d i t e d o u t
of existence.
W e g o t o every effort after m a t c h e s
to write reports that inform a n d entertain
people a b o u t IC sport. S o w h y is it that
in last w e e k ' s issue o f Felix at least t w o
p a g e s w e r e d e d i c a t e d to films, arts,
music a n d g a m e s whilst sport received
just over a page, ignoring a report writ-
ten by IC Ladies I h o c k e y entirely.
This is not t h e only time that sports
teams have b e e n d e n i e d coverage in
felix. W e u s e valuable d r i n k i n g t i m e ,
using all of our literary skill to write these
reports, the least y o u c o u l d d o is print
t h e m .
Lots o f love

Sports reports, as with every other article
In Felix outside this letters page, may be
edited for length, breadth or content.
It Is difficult to judge how much
space to reserve for sport (usually the last
pages to be finished) - a problem that
obviously doesn't occur with the review
pages. Perhaps a mutually satisfactory
solution would be for sports teams to let
Felix know before Wednesday If they
are playing and If they are likely to sub-
mit a report (and If so, of what length).
Alternatively, If anyone wants to be a
Felix sport reporter...
Lots of love and Happy Valentines

Fire in Princes Garden
' n Sir,

idence, a n d m a k i n g n o attempt to c o n -
duct such roll calls d u r i n g actual alarms,
I have b e c o m e e v e n m o r e a l a r m e d by a
recent incident that o c c u r r e d .

At 1.20pm o n W e d n e s d a y 27th Jan-
uary I w a s returning to m y r o o m in a
Princes G a r d e n Hall w h e n I noticed that
o n e o f the kitchens w a s full of s m o k e
a n d t h e oven inside w a s still fully o n . M y
girlfriend a n d I immediately acted by try-
ing to alert t h e p e o p l e in t h e n e i g h -
bouring rooms, turning t h e oven off a n d
t e l e p h o n i n g S o u t h s i d e Security. T h e
Security Officer s u g g e s t e d that t h e fire
doors s h o u l d be o p e n e d so to clear t h e
s m o k e , despite t h e m constantly remind-
ing us not to prop o p e n fire doors. O n
realising that this w o u l d set o f f t h e
alarms h e eventually said that he w o u l d
c o m e over to deal with this d a n g e r o u s
situation. After waiting for 20 minutes
Security h a d not turned up.
I have subsequently f o u n d out that
another student w a s responsible for leav-
ing the o v e n o n after he had finished
c o o k i n g a n d had left t h e building. This
had caused a fat filled grill tray, inside the
oven, to generate the s m o k e a n d poten-
tially p r o d u c e a fire.
I believe that this w a s a potentially
serious incident that w a s s e c o n d s away
f r o m d e v e l o p i n g into s o m e t h i n g seri-
ous. I w o u l d therefore very m u c h like a
response f r o m Southside Security as to
w h a t they feel is a serious threat to our
well b e i n g in Halls a n d an answer as to
why they did not respond to a serious fire
warning.
Yours faithfully,
A c o n c e r n e d resident.
Well, security, we are waiting...

W a d e Gayed would like to explain the
events surrounding the ICSMSU Rag Dash,
which has created so m u c h contropversy
in recent weeks.
"The panic a n d upset w h i c h w a s
caused by m y actions deeply upsets me,
and M i k e Smith a n d myself appologise
unreservedly for any harm w e may have
done. However, o n the Friday evening
[immediately after the eventl, w e were led
to believe that the Circle Line Pub Crawl
and the Invasion of f o n d o n - our t w o key
events - were in danger, and were put
under pressure to take action. It saddens
me that s o m e students don't think they
were being supported - I'm always there
for every medical student, and at the time
I was led to believe that I was acting in the
interests of the students. W e ensured that
Rag Week could continue, and the student
reaction allowed the rest of Rag to g o
ahead without further incident.
