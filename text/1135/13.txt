similar.

AntzXhis film will b e spectacular with its
brilliant a n i m a t i o n a n d cute story line.
M i n d y o u , a s with all D i s n e y films t h e
trailers e x p o s e d all t h e best bits. If y o u
listen carefully y o u will h e a r t h e v o i c e s

c o l o n y f r o m t h e g r a s s h o p p e r s . After
s e e i n g this film y o u will never l o o k at
a g r a s s h o p p e r in t h e s a m e light a g a i n .
H e finds w h a t h e thinks is a t r o o p o f

W h e r e a s A n t z w a s full o f 'adult'
jokes this has a sense of h u m o u r a i m e d
at c h i l d r e n . It's definitely not a film for
all a g e g r o u p s to enjoy but g o a n d s e e
it anyway. Q

Your Friends & Neighbours * * *
Starring : Amy Brenneman, Nastassja Kinski, Jason Patric, Ben Stiller
Director: Neil LaBute
T
here a r e certain directors w h o
clearly aren't t o o h a p p y with their
lot in life, filling every m o v i e they
make with death, depression a n d suf-
fering - a n d Neil LaBute is o n e such
man.
His debut m o v i e . In t h e C o m p a n y o f
M e n , s a w t w o heartless office workers
dating, then d u m p i n g a frail deaf girl just
because they w a n t e d to hurt s o m e o n e ,
and Your Friends & N e i g h b o u r s presents
m o r e o f t h e s a m e . Consequently, t h e
cast consists o f Patric's social evil incar-
nate; a w i f e w h o w o n ' t b e t o u c h e d
(Brennerman); a quarrelling c o u p l e w h o
are cheating o n each other (Stiller a n d
Keener); a h u s b a n d w h o practices his
o w n brand o f self-loving (Aaron Eckhart);
and a drippy lesbian (Kinski).
American indie movies o f this kind -
deliberately low budget and lo-fi - live a n d
die o n t h e strength o f their cast, a n d it's
here that Your Friends shows its depth. All
CGI ten times more powerful than that used on Toy Story. Wow.
of t h e six principle actors are o n t o p
form, but its Patric w h o storms through
with a grandstanding performance, filled
with tales of date-rape and 'revenge' sex.
Like I said, LaBute is not a happy man.
Filled with g a g s w h i c h you'll feel
u n c o m f o r t a b l e l a u g h i n g at, endlessly
quotable dialogue and a warped sense of
fun, your take o n t h e m o v i e will ulti-
mately d e p e n d o n your o w n views (and
experience) of sex. [ J

The X-Files
In t h e face o f a barrage o f TV to movie
adaptations that have proved just h o w
easy it is to m a k e a b a d film, The X-Files
Movie is a refreshing c h a n g e w h i c h
stays very true to its roots. Consequently
the film plays very m u c h in the style o f
an e x t e n d e d e p i s o d e o f t h e hit scries.
The increased b u d g e t is obvious, but
sensibly utilised, a n d the m u c h vaunted
plot e x p o s e s simply leave even more
u n a n s w e r e d q u e s t i o n s . M o s t i m p o r -
tantly, M u l d e r a n d Scully don't 'get it o n '
(as Barry W h i t e w o u l d say).
The difficult bit of any TV to movie
transition is h o w to cater for both the
long-term fan a n d the n e w c o m e r , a n d
its here that The X-Files really succeeds.
A c o u p l e o f entertaining 'hello, this is
w h o w e are' s c e n e s get that out o f the
way early o n , a n d f r o m there o n it's
plain sailing into a truly breath-taking
finale.
The Avengers
To be honest, I didn't actually think The
Avengerswas that bad. There arc s o m e
nice ideas o n show; the cast aren't at all
bad; a n d (surprisingly) it struggles to
retain t h e spirit of the original. However,
I'm not o n e to walk in the face o f pub-
lic o p i n i o n o n such matters, a n d it's
undeniably true that The Avengers is a
mess. Edited to bits, it simply makes no
sense in places, a n d is utter indulgence
in others (Eddie Izzard a n d Shaun Ryder
in a mini, c h a s i n g Lima T h u r m a n and
Ralph Fiennes with radio-control wasps).
It's only r e d e e m i n g feature is t h e sight
of Sean C o n n e r y in a giant teddy-bear
c o s t u m e .
Species 2
S o m e t i m e back in July I w e n t to the cin-
e m a with a g r o u p o f friends to s e e The
Wedding Singer. O n e of the trailers was
for Species 2. If w a s so b a d w e started
to laugh. W e w e r e still laughing after
three more trailers. W e still couldn't stop
l a u g h i n g w h e n the movie itself began
to roll. W e only s t o p p e d laughing w h e n
a very well-built usher told us that if w e
didn't shut u p h e ' d t h r o w us out. As far
as I'm c o n c e r n e d , that's not a g o o d
sign. Even m y blind-desperate friends -
the o n e s w h o liked Showgirls - didn't
like Species 2. Be w a r n e d . D
