This weekwe profile Ross McKenzie's lunchtime show. Record the 'Nick-
ers and Pants' Show on Wednesday lunchtlme for next week's feature.
So, what do you do at IC Radio then?
I present the M o n d a y a n d friday lunchtime s h o w s a n d a g o o d Job t o o 'cause
I'm d a m n e d g o o d at it.
What makes the lunchtime slot so attractive?
It's a chance to s e n d out s o m e mainstream tunes a n d cheesy jokes w h e n peo-
ple in Southside are either c o o k i n g or getting out o f b e d . I've built m y illustri-
ous career o n t h e subtle yet daring art o f daytime broadcasting, Following in
the hoof-prints o f other such bastions o f quality as A n n e D i a m o n d a n d Richard
& Judy. Lunchtime is a great opportunity to c o m p e t e with the larger stations with
a similar a p p r o a c h but using t h e advantage o f that Student Radio e d g e . M a n .
Eh, yeah, fine. Where's the Ross McKenzle lunchtime show going Just now?
Kent.
What? Kent the stereotyplcally anal English county?
Eh, n o the hip y o u n g Swedish b a n d with t h e s a m e n a m e as t h e stereotypically
anal English county. But I'd always b e u p for d o i n g a r o a d s h o w event in Kent.
Or anywhere else for that matter.
So what makes a good lunchtime show?
Confidence, g o o d music, audience participation a n d regular features. A n d a g o o d
presenter o f course.
What regular features have you got then?
There's ' N a m e that Crisp' m y fantastic exciting a n d patented g a m e s h o w with
stunning prizes to be w o n . There's also a weather bulletin with Albert Hall. Eh,
I usually resurrect s o m e cliched 'guess t h e link b e t w e e n these three records'
type of thing as well. Cutting-edge broadcasting y o u k n o w .
Yes I imagine It is....
O h yeah I'm p l a n n i n g o n d o i n g m y entire s h o w f r o m t h e IC Radio toilets s o o n .
I don't think it's ever b e e n d o n e before a n d g i m m i c k s usually g o d o w n fairly
well. It's g o o d t o have a laugh o n c e in a while.
Any ambitions for your show?
Yeah I'd like t o broadcast it to m o r e than three hung-over students a n d a c o u -
ple o f pigeons o n e day, just t o s e e h o w it'd g o d o w n . O n e o f t h e d o w n sides
of b e i n g at IC is the social apathy. I'd love to k n o w h o w it'd feel t o broadcast
on Radio 1, k n o w i n g that 3 million p e o p l e are listening t o what you're doing.
Any final messages for the readers of Felix and even the odd 1C Radio listener?
Yeah there's lots o f funkincss a n d social fibre t o b e f o u n d o n IC Radio w h i c h I
think most IC students could d o with. I h o p e that if yo u can listen in to t h e s h o w
then you'll find it a g o o d student alternative t o what's o n elsewhere. Cheers.
