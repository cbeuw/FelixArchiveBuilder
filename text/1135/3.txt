Rag Pulls Out All The Stops
Rag W e e k '99 has proved to be o n e of
the most successful in ICU Rag history. A
total of nearly £5000 has b e e n raised for
this year's charities, thanks to a plethora
of events w h i c h t o o k place over the last
two weeks.
Having kicked off with the S p o n -
sored N u d e k a m i k a z e Parachute J u m p
a n d Variety S h o w earlier In the w e e k
(see Felix 1134), the fundraislng really
moved into gear with Wednesday's Street
Collection. In excess of £800 w a s col-
lected d u r i n g the day, t h a n k s to t h e
manic efforts of the C a n o e a n d M o u n -
t a i n e e r i n g Clubs. A further £200 w a s
a d d e d to the total via Thursday's h y p n o -
tism show, given by former Felix Editor
turned professional hypnotist Martin Tay-
lor - the highlight of which was w h e n o n e
poor girl was c o n v i n c e d that s h e had to
kiss a random m a n in the a u d i e n c e every
time she heard the w o r d "peanuts".
O n e of the most successful events,
however, was the field C u p , w h i c h t o o k
place on Saturday 30 January. O r g a n i s e d
by City & Guilds U n i o n , the C u p is basi-
cally a pub-crawl a r o u n d the local area.
Teams of four slowly w o r k e d their way
a r o u n d t h e g r u e l l i n g t h i r t e e n stop
course, w i n n i n g points for tasks c o m -
pleted in each pub, with b o n u s points for
fancy dress, mascots a n d 'treasure' col-
lected, fortunately, amidst the large-scale
collection of South K e n m e m o r a b i l i a
(road signs, traffic cones, police e q u i p -
ment and C C U mascots), the t e a m s did-
n't forget the real reason of Rag - raising
m o n e y for charity - and nearly £1000 was
m a d e o n the day.
N o n e t h e l e s s , c o m p e t i t i o n for t h e
main prizes was very fierce, with several
teams h a r a n g u i n g the marshals well
into the night. Eventually, however, the
w i n n e r s w e r e a n n o u n c e d by C & G U
President R e u b e n Connolly. The 'best
mascot' prize w e n t to the 'Fridgefella's'
w h o , for bizarre reasons w h i c h they
refused to m a k e clear, d e c i d e d to carry
a fridge a r o u n d for the entire day -
even bringing it into the U n i o n bar to
receive its prize. The 'best fancy dress'
award w e n t to 'Drink.Feck.Arse&Girls'
w h o came dressed as the cast of Father
Ted (complete with pet brick a n d dog-
collars). The day's t w o biggest prizes -
the most m o n e y raised, a n d the C u p
itself-went to 'Coconuts don't migrate',
w h o raised an Impressive £166.51 dur-
ing the day.
Rag W e e k culminated last M o n d a y
with another C&G organised event, the
Slave A u c t i o n . A p p r o x i m a t e l y t w e n t y
'lots' w e r e o n offer (mostly U n i o n offi-
cers of s o m e sort), selling 24 hours of
their time in return for d o n a t i o n s to
charity. A l t h o u g h the s h o w started off
slowly, with the first f e w slaves b e i n g
sold for £10 - £20, things hotted u p
after ICU D e p u t y President M a r i e
By David Roberts N i c h o l a o u w a s d r a g g e d o n t o the stage,
to face a stiff b i d d i n g war b e t w e e n her
boyfriend a n d her football t e a m . The
footballers eventually w o n t h r o u g h , bid-
d i n g £52.50 for M a r i e to s p e n d her 24
hours cleaning their boots. Bidding then
got into gear, with Felix Editor Ed Sexton,
C & G U D S O Sanella Hodzic, ICU A c c o m -
m o d a t i o n Officer N a t a s h a N e w t o n , a n d
C & G U Treasurer Ian Clifford all g o i n g for
In excess of £50.
The star item, however, was a 'job
lot' w h i c h included ICU President Dave
Hellard, C & G U President R e u b e n C o n -
nolly, Phil B u c k m a n a n d Matt Tibber. A
large g r o u p of students f o r m e d a con-
sortium a n d offered in excess of £200 for
a p e r f o r m a n c e of the Full M o n t y - bring-
ing the grand total raised by the Auction
up to nearly £900. O n M o n d a y evening,
the g r o u p duly o b l i g e d , a n d their s h o w
was received with a mixture of laughter
a n d a p p l a u s e f r o m the a s s e m b l e d audi-
e n c e .
A d d e d together, these events have
p r o d u c e d a grand total o f approximately
£5000 for the four Rag charities - Shelter,
Imperial Cancer Research, Avert a n d Trin-
ity Hospice. A l t h o u g h this figure pales in
c o m p a r i s o n with that raised by other
universities a n d e v e n the IC M e d i c s , it
represents the first step towards these
levels, a n d m o r e than trebles the amount
raised last year. A great deal of praise has
b e e n given to Rag Chair Sarah Coburn for
her efforts in ensuring that Rag W e e k was
a success, w h o a d d s her o w n note of
appreciation, "A b i g thank y o u to every-
b o d y w h o t o o k part in, or h e l p e d with,
any rag event".
