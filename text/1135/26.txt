IC IV 3 - 0 UCL V
(Sat 23rd Jan)
Well, what c a n w e say? R e d u c e d to t e n
m e n f o l l o w i n g a h o r r e n d o u s c h a l l e n g e
on o n e o f our stars, Stephen Dewar, this
g a m e w a s perhaps t h e c r o w n i n g point
of our U L U season s o far. Brave S t e p h e n
was rushed to hospital, a n d thankfully as
nothing w a s b r o k e n , h e s h o u l d b e back
playing in a f e w w e e k s time.
O u r jungle skills f l o w e r e d u n d e r the
grim sky as o u r fourth w i n o n t h e trot
accelerated us into third place, just o n e
spot o f f automatic p r o m o t i o n . Specifi-
cally, the touch o f the elephant/ lastadon
was not in o u r ranks today. Nick, Bola,
Dave, J o h n a n d Elliot h a d all b e e n
blessed with t h e skill o f t h e r a c o o n , a n d
our ever-solid d e f e n c e with t h e consis-
tency o f a yak. T h e first goal w a s born- a
vivid, joyful c o m b i n a t i o n terminated with
a clinical finish.
The s t a m i n a o f t h e m o u n t a i n billy-
goat then set well in, replaced at t i m e s
with the stealth o f t h e leopard a n d t h e
low cunning o f the fox. O u r t e a m surged
forward like a herd o f buffalo a n d over-
came t h e Shenley S c u m . A n d then t h e
s e c o n d goal w a s created...and also a
third...From there w e h e l d fast like a
b a b o o n colony a n d waited patiently for
the final whistle, with u n s h a k e a b l e c o n -
fidence. For t h e record, t w o o f the goals
were scored by A i d e n , a n d t h e other by
John, a n d thus t h e spirit o f P h a e d o n ,
the mighty m o n g o o s e , lives o n . Thanks
chief.
KCL III 2 -1 IC IV
(Wed 27th Jan)
W h e n these t w o t e a m s m e t last t e r m
Kings w o n by three goals to o n e , I wrote,
albeit t h r o u g h gritted teeth, that "they
were just that little bit t o o strong for us".
H o w e v e r in this rematch w e m o r e than
m a t c h e d the King's d o g g e r s in every
true aspect o f football, apart f r o m those
little necessities o f luck, g o o d fortunate,
a n d o f course, a " h o m e " student referee
w h o gave every important decision to his
t e a m .
M a n for m a n , every single o n e o f
our players w a s m o r e skilful, m o r e deter-
m i n e d a n d m o r e c o m m i t t e d that their
counterparts. Kings are comfortably at
the top o f the division, s o w e c a n s e e n o
reason w h y w e can't g o t h e rest of t h e
s e a s o n u n d e f e a t e d , a n d thus finish t h e
s e a s o n p r o m o t e d as either runners-up,
or perhaps, C h a m p i o n s . A n d also theres
BUSA; lets beat Reading, a n d pray w e get
drawn away to Bath- h o w I'd laugh, h o w
the o l d boys w o u l d love it! -1 w o n d e r if
their U n i o n is as sh*te as it u s e d t o be...
Back to t h e g a m e , IC d o m i n a t e d ,
w e h a d loads o f chances, s o m e badly
missed, others well saved. Kings scored
after o n e o f their players handled and w e
all s t o p p e d . A g a i n w e d o m i n a t e d
d e s e r v e d getting a equaliser with five
minutes to g o (Fred crossing to t h e back-
p e g a n d their d e f e n d e r b u n g l i n g t h e
ball h o m e under m u c h pressure). But
then in t h e last m i n u t e a streaky cross
f o u n d its w a y to an u n m a r k e d striker 20
yards out. H e s m a s h e d it o n t o t h e cross
bar, d o w n to o u r star d e f e n d e r Elliot,
w h o , in trying to m a k e a full clearance
w a s s o unlucky to s e e t h e ball r e b o u n d
off t h e b e m u s e d striker's chest into the
goal. Laugh?, w e nearly cried.
O n separate note, it w a s interesting
to s e e three u n i o n sabbaticals o n that
W e d n e s d a y afternoon, t w o playing foot-
ball a n d o n e watching. O n e rule for one,
o n e for another? -nice, ICU.
IC I 5 - 20 Aberystwyth
The W e l s h p e o p l e c a m e to Harlington
a n d they w e r e very fat. Aberystwyth is
the biggest pie factory in W a l e s a n d
s h e e p are t h e m a i n ingredient. The
Welsh h a d t w o secret w e a p o n s . As kick-
off approached, 2 m e m b e r s o f the t e a m
removed their hats to reveal their ginger
hair. Luckily it didn't rain. As t h e g a m e
progressed, it b e c a m e clear that t h e
entire t e a m w e r e related a n d h a d a
sheepish look to t h e m . Despite their
obvious deformities, their d e f e n c e c o n -
tained n o "leeks" (Ok, n o w y o u p u s h i n g
it - Sports Ed). Perhaps t h e highlight o f
the g a m e w a s Matt "these shorts can't
contain m y arse" Cockay s t a m p i n g o n
W e l s h m a n ' s "rarebit", a n d t h e n pro-
c e e d i n g to flop over for a try. U n f o r t u -
nately whilst w e w e r e trying to w o r k out
the family tree, t h e Cymru supporters
scored a f e w tries. Bring o n devolution,
w e don't want t h e m anyway.
IC II 5 - 29 Chichester II
W e faced a n u n k n o w n challenge but it
w a s quite a pleasant day. Pete brought
his v i d e o c a m e r a t o film s o m e hard-
core action, but unfortunately w e w e r e
o n t h e receiving e n d . W e got a severe
brusing instead, yet w e held our ends for
the first half. Their national standard a n d
i m m e n s e size m a d e us r e d , raw a n d
sore. O u r rear guard action held dignity
for most o f the first half. However, after
s o m e playful behaviour a n d p u n i s h i n g
penetration by t h e o p p o s i t i o n w e gave
w a y a n d y i e l d e d to their a d v a n c e s .
Score at this t i m e 5 - 0 .
After half t i m e r e f r e s h m e n t , w e
p o u n d e d a h e a d e v e n t h o u g h w e w e r e
constantly a c h i n g . Thanks to Bully's
technique w e h a d our balls constantly at
their feet.
M e a n w h i l e G o o d O l d Jim "super-speed"
Sopper scored a try that w a s t h e high-
light o f t h e match.
IC III 4 -2 Nothampton Exiles
There are s o m e certainties in life - t h e
creation, Birth, Death a n d a 3XV t e a m
f o r m i n g 5mins before t h e match! What
was unusual w a s that t h e pull o f this first
BUSA cup knockout match h a d attracted
reserves a n d lots o f t h e m !
O u r opposition were, frankly, Herculean!
Not o n e w a s under 6'2" or 17 stone. We,
o n t h e other h a n d , t o a m a n , lithe, slight
a n d smart. The match started a n d after
s o m e clumsy play by t h e o p p o s i t o n , w e
had a scrum - w e h a d little c h a n c e a n d
w e r e driven back. W e s o o n w o r k e d to
the we a k ne sses of these steroid m o n -
sters, d a m a g e broke through eventually,
a n d t h e n with characteristic co-ordina-
t i o n , l i n k e d with t h e entire back
line...leading to G u t m o u n d diving over
for ur o n l y 4 points. T h e rest o f t h e
g a m e w a s s i m p l e to-ing a n d fro-ing,
until, just b e f o r e t h e final whistle, t h e
exiles scored their t w o points.
The result w a s a testament to intelligent
play o u t w i t t i n g fat-bags with football
IQ's! Utter crap really as w e w e r e shat
o n but m o r e f u n than saying " w e got
dicked o n 44 - OH"
