High End (> £1000)
Processor – Intel Core 2 Quad. Any
model is fine, but make it a Quad
core. Equivalent AMD CPUs are
too expensive and much hotter.
Just about every AMD CPU is over-
priced and hot. Do not get AMD.
The Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 is a
good choice.
Motherboard – Get an nForce
6, S775, or a high end 965 board. It
must have all the essentials, quad-
core support, dual PCI-E, and the
like.
We’re fans of the ASUS P5NT-WS
SLI, ASUS Striker Extreme.
Graphics – Not much choice at
the high-end. Get a 768MB 8800
GTX. Or a pair of 320MB or 640MB
8800 GTSs in SLi.
Hard Drive – Raptor all the way.
Get one small (~70GB) WD Raptor
drive for installations, and a huge
(300+GB) drive for data.
Cooling – If you absolutely must
have water-cooling, get a casing
with one already installed. It’s an-
noying to fiddle around with the
pipes. For fans, get one of those
huge Zalman or Thermaltake CPU
coolers.
Power Supply – Enermax Liberty
series, 800W at least. In terms of kit
and stability, its one of the best.
Mouse – Any Razer or high end
Logitech mouse. Mostly down to
user-preference. The Razor Cop-
perhead is a good choice.
Keyboard – Up to you, really.
Whichever keyboard feels the best.
Microsoft tend to make good key-
boards. Try the new Microsoft Nat-
ural Ergonomic 4000 or the Logi-
tech G15.
Sound – Creative X-Fi. Whichever
model suits your fancy. Maybe one
of those with a ‘-pro’ or ‘fatal-one-
ty’ suffix.
Casing – Get a lovely big one from
Thermaltake or Coolermaster.
Such as the Coolermaster Stack-
er or the NZXT Lexa or even the
ASUS Vento 3600. You’ll appreciate
it later, although LAN party organ-
isers won’t.
Mid Range (£600 – £ 1000)
Processor – Intel Core 2 Duo. The
E6600 or E6700 will last, and al-
ready has lasted, a long time.
Motherboard – Get a high end 965
board such as the Gigabyte DS4, Gi-
gabyte DQ6.
Graphics – Get a 320MB 8800
GTS. These cards offer a great per-
formance/price tradeoff.
Hard Drive – Get a moderately
large SATA II drive, bear in mind
that many games are approaching
When Half-Life 2’s Lost Coast was released, showing off HDR (on the right), we thought that was the new limit. A year on, and graphical technology has leapt on even further
5Gb minimum now.
Cooling – The stock Intel coolers
are more than enough, and your
components won’t be over-running
anyway.
Power Supply – Enermax Liberty
series, 600W at least. It still never
hurts to have a solid base, however,
so consider the High End 800W op-
tion, too.
Mouse – Any Razer or high end
Logitech mouse. Mostly down to
user-preference. The Razor Dia-
mondback is a good choice.
Keyboard – Try the Microsoft Dig-
ital Media Pro. Make sure the er-
gonomics are good for you though
– many of these were designed
for other things than gaming, and
WASD feels funny on some.
Sound – Creative X-Fi XTreme
Music or XTreme Gamer. Both are
XTremely good. (Ho ho)
Casing – Again, Thermaltake or
Coolermaster. But get a cheaper
one such as the Thermaltake Ar-
mour Jr., the Thermaltake Aguila,
or the Coolermaster Wavemaster,
bearing in mind our mid-end cool-
ing options, too.
Low End (< £600)
Processor – One of the earlier Intel
Core 2 Duos. The E6300 or E6400
will be enough.
Motherboard – Get a good 965
board such as the Gigabyte DS3 or
DS4, or a low end ASUS P5N.
GFX – Wait till DX10 card prices
drop. There are good low-end cards
on the market, but you’d be wasting
money when there’s a price drop up
ahead.
HDD – Get a moderately large
SATA II drive. Storage isn’t some-
thing you can scrimp on easily,
unfortunately.
Cooling – The stock Intel coolers
are more than enough.
Power Supply – Enermax Liberty
series, 500W at least. Again, power
is power, and PCs always need
more.
Mouse – Any Razer or high end
Logitech mouse. Mostly down to
user-preference. The Razor Krait,
perhaps.
Keyboard – Any keyboard will do
fine. If you’re getting really picky,
take a look at a low-end Logitech
for sturdy, reliable components.
Sound – None required. If you
must have one, get an old Audigy
card. Many gamers find sound to be
a secondary consideration.
Casing – The Coolermaster Cen-
turion 5 is an absolute bargain.
Overall, it’s important to bear in
mind that things need to be kept
at a similar level. Splashing out on
a big graphics card because you
think that’s going to pull up the rest
of your system won’t work, because
things tend to run at the speed of
the slowest.
Above all else, make sure the
components are good quality ir-
regardless, and keep everything
balanced around the CPU. Failing
that, just phone up Dell.
Hah! Just kidding.
“Dell”.
Woooooo … “Dell” … Hoo hoooo.
The future of graphics technology – big-ass frogs.
