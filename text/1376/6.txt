It’s white guys with guitars
Only one page this week before an onslaught of pages for the term’s final issue
Saying that Babyshambles' no-
toriously chaotic front-man Pete
Doherty has a slight time-keeping
problem is like saying he might
have a tiny drug problem. Knowing
this I can't help feel that half of the
incredibly packed Brixton Acade-
my expects to be told to head home
before Babyshambles even hit the
stage tonight. Enough has been
said about Doherty's personal life
though as tonight it's all about the
music, at least for me. Whether or
not he's high doesn't really bother
me one bit, there's only one thing
I want to know. Does he cut it in
person?
Having never seen Doherty per-
form live, in either guise, I want to
get the chance to catch a glimpse of
the man that has inspired a genera-
tion of teenagers. Certainly the man
can cut it on CD, showing off his
creative abilities with The Blinding
EP, but can he hold it together in
front of a packed out Brixton Acad-
emy full of his adoring fans?
A thoroughly entertaining warm-
up was provided from the up-and-
coming I Was A Cub Scout and the
hotly tipped Little Man Tate (we
missed Brighton rockers My De-
vice, although having seen them
before, they were rather good) who
both seemed to really relish the
chance to play a venue the size of
Brixton Academy playing with tre-
mendous energy.
As the increasingly anxious crowd
awaitedthearrivalofBabyshambles
on-stage the usual twenty minute
mid-band pause seemed to take a
lifetime as the security guards pull
six or so squashed kids from the
crowd; one of whom can no longer
walk for whatever reason. Such is
the hysteria that Pete Doherty is
surrounded by that the fans don't
even scream for Babyshambles.
As they appear on-stage, an in-
stant and massive roar greets
them. A roar which lulled as they
launched into their set with crowd
pleaser Pipedown. With Brixton
full-to-bursting with fans eager to
catch a glimpse of frontman Pete
Doherty, almost inevitably crowd
troubles forced a untimely pause
three tracks in as Babyshambles
were forced to leave the stage after
calls for the crowd to move back
failed.
After their return they picked up
where they left off playing some
new material in the form of De-
livery and tracks taken from The
Blinding EP
, Beg, Steal or Borrow
and Sedative. Special mention
should go to I Wish, played towards
the end of the seventy minute set;
it stole the night and had the whole
crowd skanking along with its reg-
gae melodies.

I’ve never even been to the Border-
line before, yet I am already giving
strangers directions. Luckily I’m
not wrong, and I find this cosy ven-
ue tucked away just behind Char-
ing Cross Road. First up tonight is
the interestingly monikered Dave
House who does his best to liven up
the crowd armed only with a guitar
and his voice. He does his best, but
perhaps he is suffering from the
symptoms of the cold that he ob-
serves “everyone in England has
right now!” Taking requests from
the crowd is all he seems to do; in
fact there is no discernable set at
all, which makes for a friendly at-
mosphere in which the crowd dic-
tates what music they hear.
Next up are Tellison, a local band
for us Imperial types, coming from
Hammersmith, who have clearly
brought a sizeable support with
them to cheer them on. They take
me completely by surprise by un-
leashing a brilliant array of tunes
packed with vocal harmonies and
infectious melodies. The band play
with such enthusiasm and energy,
never without a smile on their faces
that it is impossible not to like them.
The biggest cheer comes for their
song New York New York which is
their only released song to date, but
watch out for their album too which
should be out next month.
Dartz! start their headlining show
off with a bit of banter with the
crowd, thanking us for coming out
to their ‘home show’. “Nah, we’re
from Middlesbrough actually,” says
the guitarist, and when the crowd
cheer this piece of information he
continues, “Well, you’ve obviously
never been!” This is a band who
specialise in great tunes, made
particularly danceable by the intri-
cate guitar parts and funky drums
which are reminiscent of Q and Not
U in their prime. Interestingly the
guitarist and drummer swap in-
struments for one song, and prove
themselves equally adept in each
other’s role.
The highlights include the hand-
clap-orientated Prego Triangolos
and most recent single, the awe-
some Once, Twice Again which
rounds off an immaculate set. The
band returns for an encore even
though no-one was really cheering
for it, which is always disappointing,
although somewhat inevitable. Wor-
ryingly for an album launch show,
the band doesn’t have any copies
of their debut This Is My Ship with
them, but I advise you look out for it
as it is surely a corker.

The Borderline
"duet" with Kate Moss on La Belle
Et La Bete, Babyshambles left the
crowd waiting for hit single Fuck
Forever. Proving an energetic and
moving ending that culminated in
Pete Doherty twirling freely across
the stage.

live reviews
Klaxons debut album finally reviewed
I have to admit before you start
reading this too much, I never ex-
pected to enjoy Myths Of The Near
Future, ever since the Klaxons
exploded onto the scene late last
year with their techno-punk style.
But as a fair-minded chap I had to
give Myths Of The Near Future a
chance.
Opener Two Recievers is slow
to start providing a nice intro for
the album building to the dizzying
techno influenced heights of the
Klaxons, it’s all there but for the
glowsticks and fluorescent hoodies.
Atlantis To Interzone rapidly takes
over with its catchy, if slightly re-
petitive, chorus. So infectious is the
chorus I can't help but hum it the
rest of the day.
This seems to be a repeating
theme of Myths Of The Near Fu-
ture and even though I never paid
much attention to the Klaxons'
previous hit singles, Magick and
Golden Skans they seem somehow
familiar, lyrics even seem to have
stuck. A pretty good testimony to
the sheer catchiness of the Klax-
ons’ debut album.
After everything that's been writ-
ten about the Klaxons' championing
the "new-rave" movement – includ-
ing the day-glo, smiley face laden
NME cover story – Myths Of The
Near Future isn't exactly what I ex-
pected. Tracks like Golden Skans
and Forgotten Works are a lot more
indie than I expected, lacking the
sirens and techno beats made fa-
mous by the new-rave genre.
When all is said and done Myths
Of The Near Future is a pretty good
album, not what it's hyped up to be
The Klaxons

but good all the same. Highlights
would have to be the almost too
catchy singles Magick and Golden
Skans but the less familiar tracks
such as Totem On The Timeline are
still so infectious they'll have you
dancing on the morning tube.

I
n keeping with me mention-
ing music at Imperial last
week, I thought I would talk
about some more stuff a bit
closer to home as it were.
With the recent announcement of
Stephen Brown – the guy I voted
for, but shhh, you are not to know
otherwise the losers will come
and remove my spleen – as Union
President elect, I thought I would
mention one of his policies that
stuck with me.
Aside from all the obvious stuff
such as keeping bar prices as
low as possible, being open and
honest, I stumbled across a bril-
liant point: trying new things in
the ents schedule and not being
afraid to make mistakes. From
a music point-of-view, the ents
is important because you want
tastes in music represented, and
the Union should be there for you.
Don’t get me wrong, the ents
has been successful this year
with sell-out events but Stephen
wants to improve diversity in
events, and we are a diverse uni-
versity. The current ents system
we have that represents the Un-
ion is an events/venue manager
who books and organises the
events with the occasional aid
from various sabbs or societies.
This is good in that there is a
dedicated officer who can oversee
everything and has ultimate con-
trol, but the diversity is limited by
only having one representative.
As far as I can see, there are
two practical ways in which there
can be more diversity: ‘privatis-
ing’ events by introducing more
outside promoters; or the intro-
duction of an ‘ents board’ which
shares the burden of respon-
sibility and creativity. The first
option is currently used in the
form of Oculo Garden, but could
go much further, eg. Afterskool
Klub at LSE and attract students
from across London. This brings
outsiders with their own enthu-
siasm and advertising impact.
However, the set-up at the Union
means bureaucracy involved and
a gamble on an outside promo-
tion company.
The ents board appears to be
the most viable at the minute and
it would involve those who run
events and so have a stake in its
running. The ents board can then
work with the ents manager for a
more diverse ents. Aaron Oliver-
Taylor (look him up in the College
directory) is trying to set one up,
I recommend you get in touch.
Wearing gaudy clothes all day can really depress you
