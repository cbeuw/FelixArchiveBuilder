Don’t sue surgeons!
“The ideals of treating a patient
effectively and efficiently without
causing inconvenience or harm
have been invaded by the practice
of defensive medicine: treating
patients in a way that averts the
prospect of being sued and taken
to court.”

Random snippets
Though elections have been grab-
bing column inches of late, other
things are afoot within the College
and Union.
Beit Petition
A paper is to be brought to Council
next week which proposes a major
change to the redevelopment of the
Union Building currently under-
way. Plans so far call for the sabb
offices to be moved up to the fourth
floor, and a large cafe area to fill the
first floor where the offices current-
ly are, providing an “alcohol-free
zone”.
The paper argues that the cafe
will be a waste of space, and that
the JCR, SCR, and Ethos cafe pro-
vide more than enough coffee shop
space. Instead, the paper proposes
to make the space into a multi-pur-
pose ‘dance studio’, with mirrored
walls and a sprung floor.
This would not only serve the
roughly 500 members of the Un-
ion’s dance societies, but could be
used as an alternative venue when
the Concert Hall is booked for any
other club. The paper highlights
arts clubs, martial arts clubs, and
overseas societies in addition to the
dance clubs.
The new area would be around
22m x 10m, making it one of the
largest studios of its kind in Lon-
don; this would encourage outside
companies to hire the space, pos-
sibly generating significant return
for the Union.
The paper also proposes that the
sabb offices should move to the new
mezzanine level that is being creat-
ed in the gym, placing them next to
the new Student Activities Centre,
creating what it refers to as a “one
stop shop for students”.
The paper is being proposed by
Jon Matthews (DPFS), Eric Lai
(DPCS), and Mark Flower (RCC
Chair), and has more than 250 sec-
onders, making it likely to be voted
through at Council.
Those damn drains
Apparently Felix was wrong about
the drains; the Union’s contrac-
tors can be absolved of any blame.
Investigations have shown that the
drain blockage is simply the result
of fifty years of scale buildup.
According to a document picked
up from a Management & Planning
Group meeting (a confidential sabb
and staff meeting), the repairs are
to cost £16,000, though this is re-
ferred to as “optimistic”. However,
a gleeful sabb was heard to declare
“at least we’re not paying for it!”,
suggesting the College have decid-
ed to foot the bill.
How the election got fixed
You may be wondering what hap-
pened after the Union Court met to
decide if removing John Collins as
Returning Officer (over allegations
of bias) was consitutional or not.
The Court decided it was not
consitutional, citing among other
reasons the fact that Exec was not
quorate (did not have enough mem-
bers present to be viable).
Exec therefore met again, and
the vote was split 3-3 on whether
to disqualify Mr Collins. Normally,
the chair would have the deciding
vote, but Mr Collins had passed
NUS delegates
announced
Alongside the sabb elections, eight
NUS delegates were also elected.
These delegates will travel to the
NUS Annual Conference at the end
of March on behalf of ICU to vote
on NUS policy for the next year.
Council has recently passed policy
that not only forbids delegates from
joining any political or religious
faction at the Conference, but also
forces them to vote as directed by
Council (in order to best represent
the views of IC students).
This restriction has angered at
least one candidate, who refused to
sign the declaration that the elec-
tion had been free and fair after
being told he would not be allowed
to sit with the Student Respect fac-
tion, having clearly been unfamiliar
with Union policy. This candidate
was not elected to be a delegate.
The next President, Stephen
Brown, was elected to be a delegate,
receiving the majority of the vote.
Mr Brown was the spiritual leader
of the ‘No’ campaign during the ref-
erendum last term, and has spoken
out against what he regards as the
“irrelevance” of some motions to
be discussed at Conference. Other
members of the ‘No’ campaign
elected were Ashley Brown (also
Live! editor), Omar Hashmi, and
Ed Hunt.
The leader of the ‘Yes’ campaign,
Alex Guite, was elected, alongside
the current Deputy President (Ed-
ucation & Welfare), Ben Harris, and
the DPEW-elect, Kirsty Patterson.
Camilla Royle, famous within the
Union for the ‘Islamophobia’ papers
that were destroyed at Council last
term, and the paper copied from the
Student Respect website that faced
heavy criticism at the last Council,
was also elected.
This gives the ICU delegation
four anti-NUS candidates, and four
pro-NUS candidates.
ICU President, John Collins, will
also join the delegation, weight-
ing it slightly in favour of pro-NUS
members.

Editor-in-waiting
Yes, other things have been happening besides election farces
the chair onto ex-Medic President
Danny McGuinness for the dura-
tion, who is not a member of Exec
and therefore could not vote! Rath-
er than drag the issue to Council,
Mr Collins gracefully stood down as
Returning Officer, making the end
result of all the to-ing and fro-ing
exactly null. Hurrah!
Election complaints
Rumours abound over what kept
the Presidential election results
from being announced until Thurs-
day. One suggests that another
sabb had been trying to sabotage a
Presidential candidate’s campaign,
there being no shortage of bad blood
between the two individuals.
Felix candidate Emily Lines suf-
fered systematic removal of her
posters, prompting the Elections
Committee to obtain CCTV footage
of the walkway to determine the
culprit.
Lastly, Diogo Geraldes told Fe-
lix he’d lost his entire deposit af-
ter waving his famous “WTF?”
sign over Jon Matthews’ head at
hustings.
He claims that WTF stands for
“wonderful tact, friend” and that
he is the victim of a serious miscar-
riage of justice. Felix laughed.
