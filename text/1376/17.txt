I
t’snewtechnologytime again,
with all sorts of companies
yellingnext-genthisandnext-
gen that. No matter what the
console makers claim, the PC
will always be the bastion of true
gaming and the tip of the spear as
far as technology is concerned.
However, as is the norm in these
cases, one has to build or buy a
computer before being able to ex-
perience any of that.
In this feature, we’ll be giving you
some general advice on choosing
components, and providing a look
at a range of low, mid, and high-end
builds, as well as our recommenda-
tions for the best of the best. But
bear in mind that, of course, these
are gaming desktops, nothing more
– and we can’t help you put the
thing together, either! You should
consider doing it if you’re brave
enough though, as it’s relatively
straightforward, and a lot cheaper
than paying for installation!
So, what does what? First, there’s
the processor – in this day and age it
would be pure madness not to get a
multi-core CPU. As more and more
people have multi-core capabil-
ity, more and more programs (and
games!) will provide support. And
with more supported programs,
more people will buy multi-cores
…and so the wheel turns.
Tied closely to the CPU is the
motherboard choice. I cannot stress
how important a good motherboard
is. It is the most important compo-
nent in your PC. Many people make
mistakes, spending loads on their
CPU or graphics card and neglect-
ing their motherboard. Ultimately,
your motherboard is what ties ev-
erything together and transmits
data between all your other parts. A
shit motherboard equals a shit PC,
simple as that. Remember to check
that its compatible with all your
other parts.
Since we’re gaming, let’s take
graphics next. If any of you are
planning to buy a computer in the
near future, I suggest you hold off
until the next generation of Direc-
tX10 (Microsoft’s foundation graph-
ic engine) cards arrive. Unless you
happen to have been born in a vat of
money, there’s no point in buying a
gaming card now and then upgrad-
ing to DX10 in the future.
Hard Drives are another often
sidelined component. As such I will
only bother you with this humble
collection of words: Western Digi-
tal. SATA II, 16MB Cache. Simple,
but crucial. Similarly, drives are
simple too – these are quite stan-
dard. Any old DVD-writer will do.
The technology is much the same
everywhere.
Now, the frivolities. If this was a
tropical country, I’d have suggested
you get at least 6 fans or a water-
cooling set. But in England, a cou-
ple of 12cm fans will suffice. Intel’s
stock coolers deserve special men-
tion. Though quite uninteresting at
first glance, those trusty black fans
can keep your computer stable up
to 1.5 to 2 times the CPU speed, de-
pending on your processor.
Power supplies (PSUs) are an-
other crucial part that many people
forget. A good PSU means a stable
computer (at least with respect to
power). 500W is the bare minimum
nowadays, with units that go up to
about 1100W. A nuclear explosion
to any gamer’s electricity bill, I’m
sure.
For mice – optical or laser; accept
nothing less. Go for wired instead
of wireless. Wireless devices are
(slightly) slower to respond than
wired ones, and some of them re-
quire batteries. We’re gamers. We
hunch at our desks anyway.
As with mice, go for wired key-
boards. Unless you plan on playing
your games from the next room or
across the street, there really is no
need to have a wireless keyboard.
A good sound card isn’t that nec-
essary for gaming, although it is
one of those things that would be
nice to have. Creative are a safe bet
for anything sound-cardy. Coupled
to that, go for headphones wher-
ever possible. You don’t want to be
distracted by the d00d next door or
by a car outside when trying to land
a frag. Otherwise, its down to per-
sonal preference.
Unless you happen to have a desk
the size of a bed you’ll need to go
with a TFT for your monitor. 19inch
should be the minimum size. And
always, always get a monitor with a
DVI connector – with a comfortable
viewing angle.
Aesthetics aside, a casing should
be chosen with respect to ease of
use, weight, stability, and sturdi-
ness. Aluminium is light but expen-
sive, but I’d rather have a hulking
steel behemoth any day. Air circula-
tion and ventilation is also another
important factor.
Unreal Tournament 3 – Commence eye-bleeding … now.
Pushing the envelope – the unforgiving games that’ll test your PC’s limits
You’ve taken our advice and put to-
gether something resembling a PC
– or maybe you want to test the one
you already have to check that the
video card’s still running? There’s
a variety of games both out now
and upcoming that are sure to do
the job.
The first, and almost oldest, is
probably Bethseda’s most recent
RPG release, Oblivion. Despite
being a year old now and holding
an unsteady place in 2006’s game
charts, Oblivion is a massive re-
source guzzler, still providing a
huge challenge to any computer
while wandering around the huge
vistas with lighting effects on full.
And if that doesn’t do the job, there
are mods that make the game even
more demanding, racking up the
settings even further and increas-
ing the richness of the visuals. If
you want to test large-scale graph-
ics, this is the one.
For those of you that have already
picked up a copy of the latest strat-
egy hit, Supreme Commander, or
those that took a spin on the demo
a month or so ago, you’ll already
be aware of the scale of waging
war. Huge populations of units on
screen at once, with varying levels
of zoom from global to close-up-
and-personal. This is a game that
takes whatever memory you’ve got
and then demands more – a terrify-
ingly impressive game when played
on the right system, if you can get
more than a 2 vs. 2 running smooth-
ly online, you’ve already got a very
capable machine.
It’s also worth taking a step even
further back in time and revisit-
ing F.E.A.R., now available at a
criminally low price. F.E.A.R. was
a demanding game upon release
– kicking up a fuss even on the best
hardware, with software conflicts
abound. Now, F.E.A.R.’s theatrical
lighting and fast-paced shooting
still provides a test to the average
gamer’s PC. If you’re playing this
on a resolution larger than a post-
age stamp, you’re taking steps in
the right direction.
But it’s the future that holds the
truly terrifying games. Already
we’re seeing the new Command
and Conquer – not thought to be
too demanding – putting large pres-
sure on a lot of mid-spec PCs. The
advent of Windows Vista and its
alleged focus on high-end gaming
means that future releases could
use even more of a machine’s raw
resources – but that might not be
the good news it sounds, as more
resources available means more
resources are used – leaving low-
end gamers in the dust while the
next-gen speeds off into the sunset.
It’s not all doom and gloom yet,
though, and thankfully the dreaded
Vista exclusives seem thin on the
ground – at least for the time be-
ing. Unreal Tournament 3 (above)
was one of the first sights we got of
the Unreal 3.0 engine, now power-
ing every next-gen game under the
sun. It’s all very well for console
gamers, who can rely (most of the
time) on developers to get the right
amount of power out of the plastic
box. But the prospect of games like
UT3 – with open-ended detail op-
tions ready to be scaled to christ-
knows-where and beyond – should
be making any gamer think twice
about putting off an upgrade for an-
other year.
The Unreal 3.0 engine has been
licensed by Sony, EA, and Square
Enix to name but three, and Epic
have already stated that Unreal 4.0
has been in development since ear-
ly 2004 (though not due to be seen
until 2010, such is their faith in the
third engine).
America’s Army 3.0, Bioshock,
and Unreal Tournament 3 will all be
using the engine that we’ve already
seen used in Gears of War. However
prepared you think you are for next-
gen – you’re not prepared enough.
