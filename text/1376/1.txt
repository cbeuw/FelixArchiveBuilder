Election results at last
Results were finally announced for
the Presidential election on Thurs-
day lunchtime, completing an elec-
tion period that has been character-
ised by Felix’s favourite five letter
word: farce.
The next Union President will be
the well-known anti-NUS figure-
head at IC and Felix Comment
Editor, Stephen Brown, who beat
the current Deputy President
(Finance & Services), Jon Mat-
thews, to take the position. Mr
Brown received 705 votes (af-
ter the transfer of preference
votes for the other candidates),
while Mr Matthews received
595 votes. Mr Brown and
Mr Matthews both re-
ceived several hun-
dred more votes
than the ‘outsider’
candidates; Diogo
Geraldes (he who
held a sign up over
Mr Matthews head
at hustings reading
“WTF?”) lead the los-
er’s field, picking up 179
votes, presumably from people
with a sense of humour. Sophie
Spillard, one of only two female
candidates standing for a sabb
position, collected 143 votes,
while the “not-really-from-South-
well Slate” candidate Julian Gian-
nuzzi picked up only 98 votes.
The position of Felix Editor was
contested by two Felix veterans,
Tom Roberts and Emily Lines, and
a new face, Ben Sinclair. Mr Sin-
clair, who had his name changed on
the ballot to ‘Felix’ as this is appar-
ently his nickname, picked up 367
votes, only 100 votes less than
Miss Lines and Mr Roberts re-
ceived. In the first round of
voting, the two well-known
Felix names were sepa-
rated by only 19 votes.
However, after redis-
tribution of votes for
Mr Sinclair, Mr Roberts was elect-
ed with 625 votes, having picked
up more second preference votes
than Miss Lines (who received 576
votes).
Deputy President (Clubs & Socie-
ties) was contested by a ‘clubs vet-
eran’, Alistair Cott, and a member
of the Slate, Alexander Balikhin.
The experienced Mr Cott won
with 687 votes compared to Mr Ba-
likhan’s 300, despite Mr Cott’s lack
of campaigning.
Four candidates stood for Deputy
President (Finance & Services), in-
cluding a Slate member, an ex-Wye
President, and a relative outsider.

Farce, free sweets and late results; this year’s elections are finally over, and here are your new sabbaticals
Your next Union President, Steve McQueen Brown
tions that an event that took place
while he was President lost more
than £25,000 (despite protestations
that it was not his fault), struggled
into last place with 140 votes. The
Slate candidate, Andrew Holland,
picked up only 166 votes, while Felix
Crossword Editor Hugh Mansfield
got 239 votes. The winner was Chris
Larvin, previously RSM Treasurer,
who was elected with 573 votes.
Deputy President (Education &
Welfare) was a somewhat predict-
able contest, with the heavily-cam-
paigning and all-round hackette
Kirsty Patterson being elected
with 718 votes, compared to Aditya
Narayanan’s 319 votes.
