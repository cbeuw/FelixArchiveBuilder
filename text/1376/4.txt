Helping prevent attacks on Iran
Felix: What compels you to under-
take this campaign against sanc-
tions and military intervention in
Iran?
Abbas Edalat: The Iran-US standoff
at the present time has a shocking
resemblance to the run-up to the US
led invasion of Iraq. The same Neo-
conservatives and hawks headed
by Dick Cheney in Washington, who
championed the cause of invasion
of Iraq that has brought the current
catastrophe for the people of that
country, are now shamelessly call-
ing for a military attack on Iran.
The same Israeli lobby which
pushed for the invasion of Iraq is
now pushing for attacking Iran.
The same strategy of lies, and dis-
tortions which was used to dupe
the international community and
soften it up for the invasion of Iraq
is again used to pave the way for
another illegal pre-emptive war of
aggression against Iran.
You only need to replace Sadd-
am’s non-existent Weapons of Mass
Destruction with Iran’s fantasy nu-
clearweaponsprogrammeandbear
in mind that “links with Al Qaeda”
and “support for terrorism” are lev-
elled against Iran as were against
the Saddam regime to get the exact
sense of déjà vu. The UN Security
Council resolutions, obtained by
US political coercion and economic
bribery, also play an exactly similar
role, namely to provide a veneer of
legitimacy for a criminal and ille-
gal act of aggression. What is now
of course new is that Iran is, on top
of all these things, blamed for the
failure of the US in Iraq, which fur-
nishes a new pretext for justifying
aggression.
The real motivation for the US is
neither Iran’s nuclear programme
nor its role in Iraq and fantasy links
with Al Qaeda. The hawks in the
US administration are resolved for
a regime change in Iran in accord-
ance with the Neo-conservative
Project for the New American Cen-
tury which aims to use the might
of the US military power to replace
defiant regimes in the Middle East
with pro-US regimes to establish
her control of energy resources and
power in the region.
The US has mobilized a mas-
sive armada in the Persian Gulf
threatening Iran with military ac-
tion. We need urgent mass action
to prevent a new catastrophe in the
region which will dwarf what we
see in Iraq. Only mass mobilization
can prevent this happening in the
next 22 months that Bush will be in
office.
Why does Iran need a nuclear pro-
gramme, given that it has so much
oil?
You should ask Dick Cheney, Don-
ald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz
who under President Gerald Ford
successfully persuaded the Shah
of Iran in the 1970s that his country
needed a large nuclear programme
with over twenty nuclear reactors
for energy production. You see a
great amount of hypocrisy here in
the Western media. The truth of the
matter is that Iran’s oil resources
are depleting fast. In fact, Iran is
spending billions of dollars a year to
import petrol for internal consump-
tion as its refineries were destroyed
by the Saddam regime thanks to
the support he received from the
West for his 8 year war on Iran. As a
developing country, Iran’s strategy
is to sell its oil so as to be able to
develop its basic and hi-tech indus-
tries and use nuclear power to gen-
erate its internal energy needs for
a growing population of over 70 mil-
lion. This is a perfectly rational and
cost-effective strategy.
Do you believe the Iranian lead-
ership’s claim that they are only
intent on nuclear energy? Do you
think that the crowds who show
up to demonstrations in favour
of the nuclear programme in Iran
tend to believe this claim, or are
they hoping that Iran will secretly
acquire nuclear weapons through
this program?
I do believe that the Iranian lead-
ership is only intent on nuclear en-
ergy. There is a fatwa, a religious
decree, by Ayatollah Khamenei, the
supreme leader, who is the highest
authority in Iran, against the pro-
duction, stockpiling and use of nu-
clear weapons which are declared
un-Islamic. The Western media,
which often condemn the Iranian
political system as theocratic, con-
veniently fail to let the Western
public know about this fatwa. The
crowds which show up to demon-
strations in support of Iran’s nu-
clear programme fundamentally
support the supreme leader and
therefore his fatwa.
The Iranian army and civilians
greatly suffered as victims of Sadd-
am’s chemical bombs, provided to
him by US and German companies
with the approval of their govern-
ments. Over 52,000 individuals in
Iran continue to suffer from those
chemical bombs, and many of them
take part in demonstrations against
theWest.Ibelievethatthesevictims
and those who march with them are
genuinely against all kinds of weap-
ons of mass destruction, including
nuclear weapons that the US has
unrepentantly used in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki and the chemical
weapons the US allowed Saddam’s
regime to use against Iran.
Iran’s President Ahmadinejad is
reported as having said that Israel
should be ‘wiped off the map’ and
organised a conference for holo-
caust-deniers. Is Israel right to feel
an existential threat from Iran?
It is a myth that Ahmadinejad has
ever said that Israel should be
“wiped off the map”. This myth was
created first by a mistranslation of
the statement Ahmadinejad made
and later by its deliberate distor-
tion. What he actually said in Octo-
ber 2005 is that “The Zionist occu-
pying regime of Jerusalem should
cease to exist in the page of time”.
He has also specifically said in very
clear terms that “Israel should go
through a regime change in the
same way that the Soviet Union
went through a regime change.”
The Soviet Union of course went
through a bloodless regime change.
Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the
final say on any major state and for-
eign matter, issued a statement af-
ter the mistranslation of Ahmadine-
jad saying that Iran has not and will
not threaten any country but that
it will defend itself against any ag-
gression. Of course none of this is
ever really reported in the Western
media.
In contrast to Khamenei’s state-
ment that rules out any threat by
Iran against other countries, the
Israeli and US leaders have not just
called for a regime change in Iran
but have publicly threatened, in vio-
lation of the UN charter, to launch
an air assault on Iran and have been
actively planning a regime change
by covert military operations inside
Iran to foment ethnic violence and
unrest in the country.
It was foolish to organise the
Holocaust conference in Tehran; it
played right into the hands of war-
mongers in Israel and Washington.
However its objective was not to
deny the Holocaust but to inves-
tigate how it has been abused to
justify the atrocities committed by
Israel against Palestinian people.
I am a critic of the Iranian govern-
ment in terms of its records on hu-
man rights, democratic rights and
its existing laws and treatment of
women, ethnic and religious minor-
ities. However, Iran is home to one
of the oldest Jewish communities
in the world and the largest Jewish
community in the Middle East out-
side of Israel, who continue to live
in peace with the majority Muslim
population and have their own re-
ligious establishment, synagogues
and members of Parliament.
Furthermore, Iran has not invad-
ed or threatened any country for
over 250 years. The same cannot be
said about the US, the UK and Isra-
el who in the past half of a century
alone have waged numerous wars
of aggression and occupation.
Another fact hardly ever reported
in the West is that, in 2003, with the
approval of Ayatollah Khamenei,
Iran made a major overture to the
US in which she pledged a de facto
recognition of the State of Israel
and an end to any material support
to Hamas and Hezbollah, in ex-
change for security guarantees and
lifting of US sanctions against Iran.
The US, having just invaded Iraq
and hoping for a regime change in
Iran as well, dismissed the overture
immediately and reprimanded the
Swiss Government for passing the
Iranian offer to Washington.
Thus the threat is not from Iran
against Israel but from Israel and
the US against Iran.
Israel has always been its own
main enemy, creating the existen-
tial threat against itself. By ethnic
cleansing of Palestinians, by wars of
aggression against its neighbours,

A campaigner against military intervention in Iran
by violating over 60 UN resolutions
and above all by its forty-year ille-
gal occupation of Palestinian land,
Israel has laid the foundation of its
own insecurity. This self-imposed
existential threat will certainly in-
crease massively if Israel commits
the folly of launching a military
attack on Iran and can only end if
Israel ends its illegal occupation
of Palestine and reverses its racist
policy of ethnic cleansing.
The Director General of the IAEA
(International Atomic Energy
Agency) says that Iran is not fully
complying with a recent UN Secu-
rity Council resolution. Why is Iran
not doing that?
Iran is exercising its legitimate
rights under the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) to enrich uranium
up to 3 percent grade for a fuel cy-
cle used in generating electricity,
which is far short of the 90 percent
enriched uranium required for a
nuclear bomb. Iran considers the
UN Security Council Resolution
1737 requiring Iran to halt its en-
richment programme as illegiti-
mate since there is no of evidence
for a nuclear weapons programme
in the country.
Iran is put on trial because of the
suspicions of some Western lead-
ers about the intentions of Iranian
leadership. The US is asking Iran
to prove a negative, that it does not
intend to develop nuclear weapons,
and for the US “absence of evidence
is not evidence of absence”.
Without any evidence of a nuclear
weapons programme, the referral
of Iran’s nuclear file from the IAEA
to the Security Council was politi-
