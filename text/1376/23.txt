Escaping the post-Christmas blues
for a week of scuba diving in the
blue waters of the Red Sea was
clearly a great plan. Still, landing
in Sharm el Sheikh and arriving
aboard the Bella 1 – the boat which
was to be our home for the week
– it was hard to believe we’d left the
cold greyness of an English Janu-
ary behind us quite so successfully.
The Bella itself was beautiful – all
polished wood and gleaming metal,
complete with sundeck and even a
jacuzzi for those who still deluded
themselves that this might be a hol-
iday rather than a dive trip. Plenty
of space, in fact, for all those essen-
tial post-dive activities: sleeping;
writing logbooks; more sleeping;
hunting through fishbooks for fish
that refused to be identified; perus-
ing dive photos; going back to sleep
again; sunbathing (for those dedi-
cated enough to find a place in the
sun that was also out of the wind –
next time I’m taking a windbreak as
well as suntan lotion.) And then, of
course, there was the eating (a lot
of eating). The food was great, al-
though the non-meat eaters didn’t
fare quite so well; the chef had a bit
of a thing for fried cucumber as an
ideal vegetarian dish.
Despite this packed relaxation
schedule, we somehow managed to
fit in a total of twenty dives. Our itin-
erary took us in a rough loop around
the Northern Red Sea, to include a
huge variety of reefs and wrecks –
according to our dive guides Nicole
and Thijs, this was where captains,
having navigated through the
straits of Suez, would customarily
hand over command of the ship to
their first mate, who would prompt-
ly run the vessel aground on the
nearest reef. You’d have thought
they might have learnt from the
first poor soul who did this – but no
– the same story was told in dive
brief after dive brief. We weren’t ob-
jecting, however. It gave us a lot of
fantastic wrecks to dive.
Our first was the Chrisoula K,
sunk on the edge of Abu na Has
reef in 1981, where the cargo of
granite tiles that had been en route
for Yemen were to be found stacked
in the hold, ‘Made In Italy’ stamps
still clearly visible on each; and
there was a still intact workshop,
complete with workbench and drill
affixed to the wall, perfectly spotlit
by the open hatch in front of it, as
if someone had just downed tools.
Further wrecks followed: the Car-
natic (1869), where we sadly failed
to discover any gold; the Giannis D
(1983), possibly sunk so its owners
could claim on the insurance; pe-
culiarly, a barge; the Kingston; the
Dunraven (1876), like the Carnatic,
a tramp steamer; and (most memo-
rably) the Thistlegorm. Finding
this last 4898-tonne, 415-foot ship
proved to be more of a challenge
than you might expect, given its
dimensions: still, our indefatigable
captain managed it, having left his
handheld GPS at home.
After an hour of aimless sailing to
and fro, we were forced to wait for
the next morning and the arrival of
someother(ratherbetterequipped)
dive boats. A few disgruntled faces
all round. The Thistlegorm itself,
however, was definitely worth the
wait. Attacked at the ironically
named Safe Anchorage F in the
Straits of Gubal by a German bomb-
er squad in 1941, the explosions
that sunk the Thistlegorm created
enough light to illuminate another
ship at Safe Anchorage H (sunk by
the same bomber squad a few days
later).
At 30 metres, however, there was
plenty of ship left for us to explore.
Two locomotive engines lie to port
and starboard of the wreck, blown
off by the bomb blast, with their
coal tenders still on deck. At the
stern, we found anti-aircraft guns,
boxes of shells (one polished by
passing divers, with ‘1929’ still leg-
ible its brass side), and further to-
wards the bow, a Bren gun carrier
tipped on its side. Inside, boxes full
of thigh-length rubber boots, four
intact trucks, each with its cargo of
three motorcycles neatly stacked
alongside one another, and a car-
go of small aircraft wings. Only
Louise, in determined pursuit of
the-most-controversial-statement-
of-the-week award, declared that
she didn’t really see what all the
fuss was about: ‘I think the Thistle-
gorm’s boring’. Tree had to be for-
cibly restrained from throwing her
overboard.
Exploring the wrecks themselves
wasn’t all there was to do, of course.
We were surrounded by underwa-
ter life on every dive: electric blue
parrot fish audibly chomping on the
coral; dense globe-shaped shoals
of glass fish; huge moray eels (one,
on the Barge, so accustomed to
divers that it let itself be stroked);
hundreds of flame-orange anthias,
clustered on the reefs, vivid against
the deep blue of the water; shoals of
silvery blue fusiliers; the elongated
silhouettes of cornet fish swimming
close below the surface of the wa-
ter, above us as we looked up; bright
yellow banner fish; two turtles, each
resting in their own caves, one of
them coming out to swim around
us once he’d got bored of being
photographed; huge, placid-look-
ing batfish; blue spotted ribbontail
rays; big bulbous-lipped Napolean
fish; toothy-mouthed trigger fish;
a reef shark circling the bow of the
Thistlegorm; anemone ‘Nemo’ fish
in pairs, defending their anemone
homes against over-impertinent
divers; crocodile fish, boxfish, and
unicorn fish (all three very aptly
named); on a night dive, spiny-
backed lionfish hunting in small
packs of three or four, following our
torchlight to track down their prey.
The last night of our stay onboard
was the chance for a great party.
Unanimously voted best-looking
member of the crew by the female
members of the group (Odiri, I be-
lieve, was a particular fan), Amr
gave what was allegedly a demon-
stration of Egyptian dancing – or
perhaps just an excuse to drag us
all onto the dance floor for public
humiliation! Dancing was followed
by singing and a very entertaining
round of magic tricks, and then a
midnight diving competition. Swim-
ming costumes on, in went Mike,
Ben W, Jenny, Tom and I. Never
ones to be bested, Nick and Ben T
followed close behind, with Ben T
then embarking on a piratical re-
boarding of the boat via the anchor
rope at the bow. Who needs a lad-
der, especially when you can earn
the glory of a spectacular bruise
and several scrapes by doing it the
hard way?
Meanwhile, in the water at the
stern, Mike was earning his title
of most intrepid underwater fight,
taking on a sea urchin with his bare
fists. And after all this excitement,
we still had energy for two brilliant
dives the next day in the Straits of
Tiran, on the Shark, Yolande and
Jackson reefs. The last dive gave us
our most hotly debated fish identifi-
cation of the week – was it a tuna?
a shark? Or perhaps that previous
unidentified species, a tuna-shark?
Ben T wasn’t watching closely
enough to contribute to the discus-
sion – far too busy kidnapping Jo
S’s fin from her right foot.
And so our fantastic week came to
an end, after a day of recovery back
in Sharm el Sheikh, with quad bik-
ing for some, lounging by the pool
for others, and a raucous evening
out at the Camel Bar for every-
one. Pretty please can we go again
soon?
