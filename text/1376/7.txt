Love, literature and landscaping
With Dramsoc’s latest play, an adaptation of Arcadia, there’s laughs to be had and lessons to be learned
Tom Stoppard’s play Arcadia was
described as a “masterpiece” by
the Daily Telegraph when it first
premiered at the National Thea-
tre in 1993. It is a play that encom-
passes a vast range of topics, from
poetry, philosophy and physics to
landscape architecture. It’s an am-
bitious comedy, one that educates
while it entertains – which made
putting on this the play a little chal-
lenging. How to tackle the highbrow
issues involved without without
turning the play into a lecture? God
knows we already spend enough
time listening to academic ram-
blings during the day to sit through

The Protagonists
Septimus Hodge
Tutor to Thomasina, Septimus is
the embodiment of the Regency
playboy. Confident to the point of
arrogance, his charm and cha-
risma cover a deeply intellectual
character that feels the loneliness
in being the sole reasoned man in a
world descending into the Roman-
tic madness.
Thomasina Coverly
Child prodigy and daughter of the
aristocratic Lord and Lady Croom.
Thomasina has an intelligence that
possibly surpasses that of Septi-
mus but it’s her innocent approach
to the world that gives her a true in-
sight into the happenings at Sidley
Park.
Hannah Jarvis
Successful author of “Caro” a biog-
raphy of Lord Byron’s lover, Caro-
line Lamb. Hannah is a closet femi-
nist obsessed with the idea of the
Romantic sham, the period of not
thinking but feeling.
Bernard Nightingale
Self-centred English lecturer who
comes to Sidley Park looking for
fame by proving that Lord Byron
killed a man there in a duel. Ber-
nard’s problem is that he’s not will-
ing to let anyone stop him from get-
ting his share of limelight.
Valentine Coverly
Descendant of the Coverly’s of the
1800s, Valentine is a churlish math-
ematician with a quiet cool. Valen-
tine is on hand to explain the work-
ings of God, through maths, to art’s
academics. Not that he believes
in God, but never mind.
Lord Byron
George Gordon Byron is a cen-
tral figure in Arcadia although
he is never seen or heard from
onstage. Lord Byron is probably
the most famous of British poets
and is considered the leader of
the Romantic movement.
His best known works are
“Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage”
and “Don Juan” although he is
more often associated with the
controversy he caused in the so-
cial circles of Regency England.
He lived a life of extravagant liv-
ing, love affairs, debts and was
plagued by accusations of incest
and sodomy. A forerunner to the
Modern artist, really. His lover,
Caroline Lamb once described
him as “mad, bad, and dangerous
to know.”
Towards the end of his life, By-
ron became involved with revolu-
tionaries in continental Europe
when he travelled to Greece to
fight the turks in the Greek War
of Independence. He never saw
any action though and died of flu
in 1824.
it all over again in the evening. But
it turns out Stoppard balances the
play almost perfectly.
Arcadia is as much about love
as it is about literature; there are
as many lines dedicated to Newton
as there are given to innuendoes.
The result is a play that leaves you
laughing, crying and a little inspired
to go out and learn again. I’ve spent
so much time on Wikipedia whilst
rehearsing this play that I found
myself reading about the diet of
the ancient greeks the other night.
I might try to slip that in somehow
before the opening night. Anyway,
here’s a quick run down of some
of the characters you’ll meet in the
play: The characters of Dramsoc’s Arcadia
