Film Felix: The New Generation
Film Felix has hung up the awards season tux and is ready to go for another year. Here’s looking at you, Kid
F
ilm Felix is evolving. As
the award season passes,
every distribution com-
pany starts all over again,
trying once again to churn
out the biggest hit of the year, nor-
mally trying to produce a slew of
material modelled on whatever won
last month. In order to celebrate the
end of this year’s crop and welcome
the new class, Film Felix is growing
up too, and it needs you!
We want to showcase a whole
range of material that goes beyond
what we have at the moment. The
Oscars are over, bah, who cares?
There’s more than simple awards
fodder out there and we want to
bring that to the attention of our
readers as well. If you are a par-
ticular fan of foreign cinema then
you may feel your view is underrep-
resented by our current section, or
you may think that any film made
after 1970 is just rubbish and want
to expose your peers to a back cata-
logue of classics. If you get an urge
whenever you meet someone to de-
clare your undying love for Stanley
Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Demi
Moore, or Lindsay Lohan then put
your obsession in print and we’ll try
and find you a platform to spread
that view. We’re talking real passion
pieces here.
Alternatively, hands up who
thought The Godfather was rub-
bish … Anyone? I’m not of the
mindset that it is, but if you are then
you must be sick to death of seeing
your favourites pushed down the
“X Greatest Movies of All Time” list
by it and its sequel. Trash it, and if
it’s done in a sufficiently entertain-
ing way then it’d be a great read
and I’m sure if you argue your case
strongly enough, you’ll find a fol-
lower or two.
Of course this isn’t all we’ll have,
otherwise we’re in danger of be-
coming either ass-kissing loons or
bitter old misers. There will still be
a home for current multiplex offer-
ings given that they are the most
accessible cinema around so if
you figure that your creative juices
aren’t being pumped by Imperial’s
Hot Fuzz turns up the heat in the countryside
There are few films I’ve seen
wherein people stand up and ap-
plaud the instant the credits begin
to roll. One was at the premiere of
the final Star Wars film: the end of
an epic saga no matter which way
you look at it; the other was to the
conclusion of Battlefield Earth
– indubitably the worst film ever
conceived, and the applause was
simply a self-congratulatory act by
the two people that had managed to
stay awake through the less-than-
epic drivel, thanking the heavens
that it was finally over.
However, I have found a third.
Fans of bizarre, irreverent, and oc-
casionally violent comedy, rejoice,
for the makers of Shaun of the Dead
have reunited to give you Hot Fuzz,
a film so consistently amusing it
does provoke you to stand up and
applaud, a quality only usually re-
served for the very heights or deep,
dark abysses of moviemaking.
Simon Pegg stars as Nicolas An-
gel, an officer in the Metropolitan
Police who is forcefully reassigned
to the peaceful village of Sandford
on the basis that he is making the
force look bad; with an arrest rate
400% higher than that of any fellow
officer, an expert command of ex-
treme driving and high-speed pur-
suits (including extreme biking), a
dead-eye when it comes to armed
responses, a mastery of unarmed
combat, and to top it off, two firsts in
Politics and Sociology, the audience
is not surprised the top brass are
envious of PC Angel (well, perhaps
Robert Andrews
not the Sociology degree part).
Sandford, an idyllic, tranquil, and
therefore dull, drab, and lifeless vil-
lage too far from any city to have a
mobile phone reception, is very dif-
ferent from Angel’s normal London
environment.
This village is said to be the safest
place in the country, and as such,
the small police force situated there
spend their days eating ice cream,
looking for missing swans, and mis-
pronouncing London in such a vari-
ety of ways you’d be convinced that
they have never heard of the place
before. So much for civilization be-
yond the M25 …
However, soon the sleepy town
appears to be hiding something
a lot more sinister as residents
start dropping dead faster than
your average series of Midsomer
Murders.
Alongside Pegg is his old partner
in comedy crime, Nick Frost, as the
oafish but well-meaning sidekick,
perfecting their double act in this
spiritual sequel to Shaun. Frost’s
character in particular proves the
most amusing in a sweet and in-
nocent way, ranging from the in-
evitable brain freeze that comes
from stuffing a Cornetto down your
throat at light speed to his inquiry
as to whether there’s a point in a
man’s head that if shot, explodes.
Pegg radiates the seriousness ex-
pected from his character, wonder-
fully juxtaposed by the rest of the
actors, which include some well-
cast cameos including Timothy Dal-
ton, Bill Nighy, and Jim Broadbent,
continuously providing a stream of
laughs at machine-gun pace.
The humour in the film varies
throughout, beginning with irony
and gradually moving towards the
slapstick action-packed finale with
numerous parodies, throwbacks,
and homages to various other films
and cultural reference points, in-
cluding Chinatown, Terminator 2,
Jurassic Park, and the videogame
Resident Evil 4. The pleasingly
over-the-top gore which begins as
numerous “accidents” befall the
villagers, including “falling on a set
of shears” and “blowing a house up
by cooking a pot of baked beans”
are horribly amusing to watch, as
you find yourself battling between
whether you should be laughing or
cringing in disgust.
The storyline is as excellently
twisted as Shaun of the Dead,
to which there are many nods in
this film, including the eponymous
shortcut sequence where several
members of the cast attempt to
leap over a series of garden fences
to varying degrees of success.
Even when the jokes are so care-
fully set up and you can see them
coming from a mile away, they are
still as funny as the more unex-
pected ones. Towards the end, the
film’s plot provides a delightful set
of eccentric, ludicrous twists that
will have you struggling not to cry
with laughter.
Of course there will be hundreds
of comparisons made between Hot
Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, but
although they begin in similar ways
and the cinematography is em-
ployed in the same way throughout
both films, the humour in Hot Fuzz
is so varied and well-paced that at
points it becomes a parody of itself
and its own ridiculous events, prov-
ing all the better for it. Neverthe-
less, it is perfectly valid to infer that
if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead,
you will absolutely revel in the com-
ic stylings of the second cinema of-
fering from the Spaced team.
So if you want to see a film that
gives you rural settlements full
of murderous conspirators, set-
pieces for delivering far-out action
sequences, heroic swans, sheds
full of high-tech weaponry, and old
pensioners being kicked in the face,
then this is most certainly worth
the asking price.
Thank heavens for city life.

and, well, whatever else people do
here, then drop us a line and we’ll
see if we can send you something
suitable.
For this week, we’re trying to sati-
ate your desire for what’s out at the
moment to wipe the nasty Oscars
taste from our mouths. We’ve tried
to include a little bit of something
for everyone so hopefully we’ll tick-
le your fancy. If not, then you know
what to do:
