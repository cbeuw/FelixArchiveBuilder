Iranian troops in combat – scenes of the future?
cally motivated and illegitimate. On
February15th,StephenRademaker,
the former US Assistant Secretary
for International Security and Non-
proliferation confessed that the
two crucial votes by India against
Iran in the Governors’ Board of the
IAEA which led to Iran’s referral to
the Security Council were indeed
the result of US coercion. Inciden-
tally India, like the other US allies
Pakistan and Israel, is not a signa-
tory to the NPT and has developed
nuclear bombs, which is tolerated
and supported by the US.
The main charge by the Western
leaders is that Iran concealed its
nuclear programme for some 18
years, but what is never mentioned
is what prompted Iran to conceal
its programme.
In fact, in violation of Article IV of
against non-nuclear countries.
Tony Blair’s decision to renew the
Trident system is similarly in gross
violation of the NPT.
Is it possible to tailor attacks and
sanctions in such a way that Ira-
nian civilians will not be harmed?
Absolutely not. In Iraq, thirteen
years of sanctions before the 2003
invasion, which were supposedly
designed against the Saddam re-
gime, resulted in the death of over
one million children alone. The
threats of UN sanctions against
Iran have already caused a large
flight of capital, economic reces-
sion and massive new unemploy-
ment. Sanctions will only hurt the
economy and the Iranian people.
Israel crippled Iraq’s nuclear pro-
gramme 25 years ago with an air
strike on its unfinished Osiraq
reactor. Can a similar military at-
tack ‘succeed’ against the Iranian
programme?
Iraniannuclearplantsarescattered
throughout the country and deeply
fortified underground, which makes
such conventional attacks impossi-
ble to succeed. That is why the US
and Israel have been shamelessly
considering (according to various
sources and reports for example by
Seymour Hersh in the New Yorker,
Philip Giraldi, an ex-CIA officer, in
the American Conservative and
more recently in the Sunday Times)
to use tactical nuclear weapons to
destroy Iranian nuclear plants.
How would attacks and/or sanc-
tions affect the region?
John McCain, the Republican hope-
ful for the US presidential elections
in 2008, who supports the military
option against Iran to be on the ta-
ble, was asked this same question.
His answer was simple: Armaged-
don. In fact, Iran is three times the
size of Iraq and has three times
more population with considerable
influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Pales-
tine and Afghanistan. An attack on
Iran will lead to a full scale war, a
major regional conflagration, mass
revolts against pro-US regimes that
will deeply destabilize the Middle
East further for decades to come.
What would you recommend
world leaders wanting to ensure
that Iran does not build nuclear
weapons to do?
The US should enter into direct and
immediate negotiations with Iran
on all issues in dispute without any
preconditions. Based on a grand
deal that the US should offer, in
exchange for security guarantees
and lifting of US sanctions against
Iran, an agreement can be reached
which would provide Western lead-
ers with the assurances they seek
that Iran’s nuclear programme
will not be diverted into a weapons
programme.
What is your sense of the opinion
on this issue amongst Iranian ex-
iles in general? Some Iraqi exiles
played a leading role in making
the case for the invasion of Iraq;
will we see a similar effort now by
some Iranian exiles?
The overwhelming majority of Ira-
nians in diaspora are against any
military attack on their country but
most of them remain passive and in
denial that such an attack is actual-
ly possible. It is vital that they stand
up with a united voice against an-
other pre-emptive illegal and crimi-
nal war of aggression, which will
bring a catastrophe for the whole
world.
anyone) as a confidence-building
measure for some two years during
its negotiations with the EU-3 (the
UK, France and Germany) in 2003-
05. But the US, the back seat driver
in the EU-3 negotiations, insisted
that Iran’s right under the NPT for
a fuel cycle be relinquished. That is
why the negotiations failed and Iran
reversed its voluntary decision to
suspend uranium enrichment early
in 2006. Since, as recognized by the
EU-3, the earlier Iranian decision
to suspend enrichment was a vol-
untary one, its reversal was com-
pletely lawful.
Iran has also offered an unprec-
edented proposal to invite Western
companies and governments in a
joint venture to develop its nuclear
programme, which together with
its pledge in ratifying the Addition-
al Protocol can provide the com-
plete assurances sought by the US
and the West that its programme
will never be diverted to a nuclear
weapons programme.
But this offer was also immedi-
ately dismissed by the US, which
makes one suspect that the US is
not after resolving the Iranian nu-
clear issue but is seeking a regime
change. Iranian leaders now say
they are standing up for Iran’s na-
tional rights under the NPT and are
refusing to be bullied by the US.
We also need to bear in mind that
the five permanent members of the
Security Council and above all the
US are the real violators of the NPT
as they have refused, in breach of
Article VI, to take any effective
steps towards nuclear disarma-
ment. The US has built new genera-
tions of nuclear weapons, including
the so-called mini-nukes or tactical
nuclear weapons, and has declared
in the Pentagon’s document “Doc-
trine for Joint Nuclear Operations”
that it will even use them “for de-
terrence” in pre-emptive attacks
the NPT, the US in the post-revolu-
tion years pressured all Western
and non-Western governments and
companies to cancel their nuclear
collaboration contracts with Iran.
Israel bombed and destroyed the
Osiraq nuclear plant in Iraq with
impunity. Also Saddam systemati-
cally committed war crimes by us-
ing chemical weapons, provided by
the West, against Iran with com-
plete impunity, despite Iran’s pro-
tests to the UN. Iranian leaders, as
Rafsanjani put it, concluded that
‘The [Iran-Iraq] war taught us that
international laws are nothing but
ink on paper.”.
Iran did in fact voluntarily halt its
enrichment programme and volun-
tarily enforced the Additional Pro-
tocol of the IAEA (for inspectors to

The greatest teaching point of med-
ical school is the way it splashes
reality in your face like a bucket of
cold water. As a student you have
ideals about how to practise medi-
cine and how to treat patients. Eve-
ry day spent in the wards reveals
that once upon a time consultants
shared the same ambitions that
are still burgeoning in the students.
Yet somewhere in the evolution of
medical student to consultant these
ideals and ambitions are both lost
and smothered.
The ideals of treating a patient
effectively and efficiently without
causing inconvenience or harm
have been invaded by the practice
of defensive medicine: treating
patients in a way that averts the
prospect of being sued and taken to
court. Tests and investigations are
made not out of neccesity or benefit
to the patient but to avoid liability.
This wastes money, time, and un-
necessarily puts patients at risk.
This practice exists because peo-

anymore. Patients continually seek
legal action, the Daily Mail has its
inevitable field day and the mother-
in-law of a government sticks its
malignant nose even further into
something it has no real under-
standing of. Most politicians don’t
have medical training or sufficient
experience of working in the NHS.
Patricia Hewitt is the current Sec-
ing – doctors do know what they’re
doing, they don’t need to be put un-
der the microscope. Let them get
on with their job.
This CCTV atmosphere does

how miniscule, needs permission,

retary of State for Health but prior
to that she was Minister for Small
Business and E-Commerce at the
Department of Trade and Indus-
try, roles which, besides manage-
rial experience, have questionable
common ground. Admittedly, man-
agerial experience is useful but she
hasn’t worked for the NHS at any
other level so it’s bewildering how
she expects to know what changes
to implement. Clearly though, her
main objective is keeping the voters
on her side and making them happy
and in attempting to do so she is
doing a wonderful job of forgetting
to consider the long-term conse-
quences of her ‘amendments’.
Whilst it is agreed that the NHS
is a service to the public and that
patients should certainly be satis-
fied and receiving the best possi-
ble care, sometimes patients don’t
always know what that is – they
might Google it, or think they know.
Be it at first glance a patronizing or
politically incorrect statement it’s
still true. Doctors and nurses have
trained for years and have first-
hand experience, they have special-
ist knowledge in their field and it is
about time some trust was handed
back to them.
Surely there exists an attainable
balance between having a cohort
of Harold Shipman caricatures and
doctors who are under 24 hour sur-
veillance, working to ‘cover their
backs in case something happens’,
drowning in red tape. The point is
professionals work by forcing them
to worry more about a possible
court case than what the patient
really needs. It is not essential to
X-ray every single patient with a
cough if the other symptoms and
signs are not suggestive of some-
thing sinister and if twenty years of
experience is telling you that there
is nothing wrong with the patient,
but the X-ray still has to be per-
formed and documented.
Giving autonomy back to the
people who have trained hard and
worked in medicine is what is need-
ed, not more tracking – it just puts
professionals under unwarranted
pressure. It wouldn’t be surprising
if the next set of junior doctors is to
be electronically tagged.
The public needs to accept that
doctors have not yet reached the
omniconscience and miracle-per-
forming powers of God so of course
they will make mistakes, but that
generally speaking they don’t
drive into work vowing to commit
malpractice.
More so, patients need to take
more responsibility for their health
care instead of riding the bandwag-
on of blame culture. After all, a doc-
tor’s job is not to cure, it is to give
patients the tools and information
to help them cope with their health
and doctors would be able to do that
a lot better if they were allowed to
use their own discretion without a
heavy cloud of scrutiny enveloping
them.
Doctors need to be left to work without having to worry about
impending court cases from patients intent on suing them
