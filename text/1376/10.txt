I
’m happy, really happy.
Happier even than I look in
my photo above, and I was
really happy in that. I’m not
sure why though, probably
a combination of my wonderful
page this week, my favourite DJ’s
playing at Our Disco this Friday,
and a load of other stuff I shouldn’t
really write about. It’s boring.
I’ll stay this happy if more
people write some reviews for us.
There are 12,185 students at this
college, I should imagine plenty
of you go out to bars or nightclubs
occasionally, and are capable of
spending 30 minutes writing 800
words of text in exchange for
free entry, free drinks and a free
handshake from myself.
Now that is out of the way, time
for more nightlife related news
and happenings-on. This week
we’ve got a fun packed and rather
varied selection of reviews. Taz
hung out with Andy C at the Ram
Records birthday party at The
End last week, and from what I’ve
heard it was a pretty sweet night.
Nick Simpson ventured far into
East London for the first of the
new And Did We Mention Our
Disco nights. Our beloved Alex
and I kept him company, and it
was the best night I’ve been out to
in ages!
The line-ups for the four special
Our Disco events are all secret
until you get into the place, so
we were pretty happy to discover
2ManyDJs were the headliners
that night. This Friday is going to
be even better so you should go!
Our final review is of The Roxy
on a Monday night. With the
demise of Trash this place is sure
to get more and more popular as
time goes on and quite rightly
so. Super cheap entry and super
cheap drinks with great music
make for a super cheap great night
out. Just don’t drink too many of
those £1.50 Kronenbergs or things
will get messy, as I’m sure some
people I know will confess to.
There’s one more day to enter
our competition to Danny Howells
at The End this Saturday, so if you
email in before Friday midnight,
you’ll win.
To round things up, I hope you all
have a lovely week and until next
time, enjoy the huge selection of
London nightlife. In the mean
time, feel free to mail in for any
reason, or send us letters/gifts.
My Nightlife pigeonhole is almost
always empty. Nobody loves me.

The End rammed with fans
at Ram Records birthday
Firm favourites in the Drum and Bass scene celebrate 15 years of residency at The
End club. Taz Alibadi hits the dancefloor at the Ram Records birthday party
awesome and he was spot-on
technically – it’s just a shame that
the venue was nowhere near its 800
capacity just yet. It started to fill
up in time for Sparfunk, who was
honestly a bit disappointing after
the initial high energy build-up by
Shimon. Soon enough though, it
was time for Red One back to back
with Sub Focus.
Sub Focus is one of the newest
additions to the Ram family and at
such a young age has already built
up a dedicated fan base and rightly

so. He played a few of his own tunes
including ‘Swamp Thing’, ‘Airplane’
and ‘Flamenco’ and the whole place
erupted, whilst Red One kept things
going nicely but seemed to have a
lesser impact.
The main dancefloor was filling
up nicely as Commix and Fierce
played back to back, building up to
a two hour set by Andy C. Things
really seemed to slow down at this
point, but we couldn’t help but think
it was the calm before the storm.
Appropriately, Andy C came on to
Ram Trilogy’s ‘Screamer’. The
main room must have filled up
in about two seconds flat and the
whole crowd pressed forward.
The atmosphere was electric;
everyone always has such high
expectations of the man they call
‘The Executioner’.
He played some classic tunes
including ‘Valley of The Shadows’,
‘Body Rock’ and ‘Planet Dust’ which
had everybody in the place jumping
up and down. Unfortunately
though, I thought his set ended up
being a little boring with the same
repetitive rolling bassline and not
much else. It was more the kind
of thing that I’d expect to hear at
Renegade Hardware (another bi-
monthly drum n bass label night at
The End – well worth checking out
if you like your basslines dark and
heavy).
We kept listening out for tunes
we recognised but he ended up
playing a lot of fairly uninspiring
new tunes. Perhaps I’ve come to
expect a bit too much from Andy C,
having seen him play several times.
He certainly kept my attention
for the first half of his set, but I’d
honestly have preferred to see Sub
Focus carrying on for an extra hour
instead. As a whole though, the
crowd really did love Andy C – they
always do!
It was now well past 4am and
the main dancefloor emptied out
as DJ Die had the unenviable task
of following Andy C on the decks.
We ended up missing most of his
tunes as we headed back into the
chill-out lounge to recuperate and
re hydrate. By the time we made
it back into the main room, it was
the final hour with Mampi Swift and
Fresh back to back. They played an
absolutely stomping set and Mampi
Swift, in particular, didn’t let the
fact that half the punters had gone
home stop him from sticking on
some awesome tunes and smashing
up the dancefloor.
It was the perfect ending to yet
another memorable Ram Records
at The End. Here’s to another
fifteen years of Andy C and friends.

This was always going to be a big
night. Ram Records at The End
is a firm-favourite in the drum n
bass calendar - a guaranteed good
night out with minimum attitude. It
takes place bi-monthly on the first
Friday of the month, and has a truly
dedicated following. For those of
you that don’t know, Ram is one of
the foremost drum n bass labels in
the world. It was founded fifteen
years ago by sixteen year old Andy
Clarke, now better known as the in-
famous DJ Andy C. Together with
Ant Miles, Red One, Shimon and
Moving Fusion, Andy C and Ram
Records have been consistently
producing first-rate drum n bass
anthems and dominating the global
drum n bass scene.
This wasn’t just another Ram
party; this was the 15th birthday of
the label with a line-up featuring
the Ram legends as well as few of
their friends from the industry. It
was definitely the kind of night
that required tickets in advance,
having sold out five days before
the big night itself. The queue for
those waiting to buy tickets on the
door was immense but those of us
who had luckily been a bit more
organised, it was a mere half hour
wait and after a stringent security
search, we were finally in the
doors.
We were straight onto the
dancefloor to hear the legendary
Shimon on the decks. For one of the
first DJs of the night, his tunes were
unexpectedly heavy but absolutely
