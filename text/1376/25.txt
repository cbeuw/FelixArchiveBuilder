Firstly, for those of you who missed
last week’s issue of Felix, the cen-
trefold was occupied by a shame-
less plug for the Musical Theatre
Society’s production of BatBoy
which hopefully some of you have
had/will get the chance to go and
see (last night is tomorrow). Be-
sides taking their clothes off and
getting covered in ketchup, mem-
bers enjoy rehearsing, socialising
and of course getting to perform on
stage. But it doesn’t stop there.
For two and a half weeks every
summer Imperial College Union
Musical Theatre Tour Society (aka
Tour to its members) invades the
sleepy Devon town of Budleigh
Salterton and puts on a show for the
local population. This is exciting in
that you get to perform to paying
members of the public as well as
have an incredibly fun and cheap
holiday. Last year Tour performed
“Babes in Arms” by Rodgers and
Hart having put on Cole porter’s
highly successful “Anything Goes”
and “Kiss Me, Kate” in 2004 and
2005. This year they’re planning to
take on a new challenge with West
Side Story.
West Side Story is a modern re-
telling of Romeo and Juliet, set in
the west side of Manhattan. The
show depicts the struggle of power
between two rival gangs, the all
American “Jets” and the immigrant
Puerto Rican “Sharks”. As with
Romeo and Juliet one of the gang
members (the American Tony) falls
for a rival gang member’s sister
(the Puerto Rican Maria) and the
two get caught up in the violent
struggle between the two gangs.
The music is composed by Leonard
Bernstein and includes the famous
songs “Maria”, “America” and
“Tonight”.
When not rehearsing or perform-
ing, the cast, band and crew like to
spend their time having other kinds
of fun taking on various forms.
Each performance ends with the
speedy removal of stage make-up
in order to get to the pub as soon as
possible. Here, apart from drinking
the local cider, the “Donkey” award
is given for the most of obvious mis-
take of the evening. Then it’s off to
the Scout Hut (a place that needs
to be seen to be believed) for ac-
ceptable after hours drinking. Here
there are parties, barbecues and,
despite the obvious lack of any ap-
parent cleanliness or hygiene in the
place, quite a lot of pulling. Once
out of alcohol or energy everyone
returns to the accommodation at
the local primary school to indulge
in literally as much toast as you can
eat (the drinkers among you will
understand the importance of toast
access after a heavy night).
As well as all this there are plenty
of other distractions including the
local beach, curry house and more
tea shops than you can shake a
fruit scone at. There is also a char-
ity concert followed by a black tie
dinner on the middle weekend, this
year celebrating the society’s 40th
year in Devon.
The society rehearses through-
out the summer term and the first
part of the summer holidays. The
Tour itself starting with the setup
on Thursday July 26th and finishing
with the last night on Saturday 11th
August. As anyone who’s been will
tell you, Tour is really good fun and
quite often an unforgettable experi-
ence. If you’re interested in being
involved in West Side Story then
please come along to our initial
meeting at 7.30pm on Monday 12th
March in the Union Dining Hall.
