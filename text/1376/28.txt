Middling success for IC shooters

Picture the scene… it’s foggy…
dark… we’re in the countryside…
it’s 11pm and a pair of headlights
appear dimly in the distance around
the corner. The sound of a diesel
engine roaring is the only noise
disturbing the evening stillness… a
lone figure stands in the middle of
the road, waving it down and direct-
ing it to turn off the main road…
sounds dramatic doesn’t it? What if
I told you it was the Union minibus
and it really was 11pm? What if I
told you the lone figure was yours
truly, having arrived with the ad-
vance party thirty minutes earlier?
What if I then told you that it was
that late because the navigator of
said intrepid union minibus had
taken one single wrong turn and
only realised the error of his ways a
full 35miles later? Ahh…. I see…
After all the drama of travelling
up to the West Midlands, getting
customarily lost, stopping at the
services early for a bursting bowel
(75mph never seemed slower!), fly-
ing down the M42 trying to make up
time then realising they were flying
in the wrong direction, stopping
properly at the services for suste-
nance, driving down unlit A-roads
with a truck going in the opposite
direction, we finally made it with
beers ready to open, Krispy Kremes
ready to chow down and the gener-
ous warmth and hospitality of Iron-
bridge Youth Hostel for the night.
The next morning would come
far too soon for most and far too
dramatically for all – however had
Ayman not stayed up all night (for
fear of sleeping in himself) and put
on his best Arnie impression at 6am
- kicked-in doors and everything
- we may not have got a full comple-
ment of shooters up and ready by
7:30 for the hour journey onto West
Midlands Shooting Ground, one of
the premier grounds in the UK and
host to the British Open last year.
On arrival it was straight down to
business. Just as soon as we had
a cuppa and a bacon sarnie – pri-
orities! But seriously now, onto the
business end of the trip we pro-
gressed. The shooting ground is
home to some of the best terrain
for sporting clay pigeon shooting
and with the number of entries
growing every year to vie for both
the Championship and the Trophy
it was apparent to all that this year
the shooting was going to be fast,
complicated, and hard to figure out
quickly. Nothing worries a shooter
more than a target they can’t figure
out how to hit – and this year there
were an abundance of challenges
and plenty of chances to watch
others try with almost guaranteed
mixed success.
The results were varied with the
first team filling in positions from
twenty-fourth to forty-ninth out of
about 60 Championship Course
competitors and the second team
filled positions from 29 to 61 out
of the Trophy competitors. In the
team competition the 1sts finished
seventh out of 16 and the 2nds elev-
enth out of 22 teams. The gradu-
ates eventually finished off fourth
out of 11 graduate teams and while
it doesn’t look particularly impres-
sive out of context, the scoring
was tight and all the teams were a
stone’s throw from picking up a few
more places in rank – a clear sign
we’re finally building up the much-
BUSA Championships Scores
IC 1sts 178
IC 2nds 171
IC Graduate 1sts 187
IC Graduate 2nds 154
needed momentum for a fight to the
front of the pack next year.
Finally, the author can only com-
miserate the club – who for the
second year running have lost the
Challenge Cup, a competition initi-
ated by Geoff Quint and Tim Aplin,
a challenge thrown down at the feet
of the undergraduates to take on the
best of the old boys and beat them
at it – the closeness of the scores
tell their own tale and we have no
doubt one day they will triumph
over us. Just not this year…
Guilds/RSCU paint the town red
There aren’t many things that can
get a student out of bed and stand-
ing outside of the Union at 9am on
a Sunday morning, but one thing
is for sure; the promise of pelting
scientists with 200mph paintballs
does! What is fast becoming an an-
nual tradition, the CGCU paintball
event saw the finest Guildsmen
(and women) clash head to head
with RCSU (scum). Headed by the
glorious yet petit James Fok the
engineers plenty out numbered
the scientists. Without any RCSU
executive or enough members for
a team we generously ‘leant’ the
scientists four strapping mechani-
cal engineers, while Mr. Vigoureux
took the challenge of captaining the
hodge podge team.
The weather was dull and inter-
spersed with rain but thankfully the
drizzle did nothing to crush the en-
thusiasm of the students. The first
two games were over a lumpy field
full of saplings and mounds.
Working with superior intellect
the engineers quickly out maneu-
vered, out witted and out shot the
scientists with two outstanding
flanking runs which saw Martinez
steal the flag, winning the game for
the engineers, without a single cas-
ualty. For the second round the sci-
entists tried to pick up their game
but could only muster a stalemate
and tie the match.
Next up was a car infested farm-
yard. Rescuing a mannequin from
the back of a tractor proved com-
plex for the engineers – with poorly
developed sense of humanity many
were distracted by the fine array
mechanical machines, instead of fo-
cusing on the task in had – rescuing
a lifeless comrade. The field ended
with a win to the scientist preceded
by a tie, the engineers needed a
new tactic.
But luckily, we had a unique ele-
ment, the engineering fast Fok. As
we went into the speedball game,
the nimble Guilds president proved
his worth by darting across the
field and picking up the flag in both
rounds. The following success was
slightly marred as the scientists
entrenched themselves for the
rounds and the ensuing skirmishes
saw a tie followed by a win to the
engineers.
All rested on the final map, both
teams had two wins and the game
reverted back to the hilly terrain
that boosted the engineers to an
early lead at the beginning of the
day. The fire fight was intense as
teams clashed at the extremes of
the map but the engineers found a
kink in the enemy lines and sneaked
into their base to retrieve the flag.
Lagging by one round the scientist
could only hope to draw the day and
a heavy bombardment of our base,
coupled with ammo running out
they managed a final win, ending
the day with no clear winner.
If this has whet your appetite for
CGCU events, don’t despair, the
traditional ‘Egg Race’ is coming up
on March 7th. The challenge is to fly
and egg as far across Queens’ Lawn
as possible from Queens’ Tower. We
are looking for teams to take on the
challenge after spending the after-
noon fashioning a plane out of balsa
wood, glue and tape. If you fancy a
chance then email guilds.honsec@
ic.ac.uk for more details.
