With Fairtrade Fortnight drawing
to a close the Fairtrade Society is
planning just one final party. With
over 100 bottles of Traidcraft Wine
to drink from South Africa, Argen-
tina and Chile and a plethora of ac-
companying cheeses there really is
no better place to be this evening
(unless you already have a ticket to
the RCSU Challenge that is).
The event kicks off at 8:00pm in
the Physics Level 8 Common Room
(that’s the posh one with the bal-
cony). Tickets are ony £4 for the
whole evening with a guarantee of
at least one bottle each. Other re-
freshments on offer include Fair-
trade Fruit Juices and One Water
from Cafe Direct.
You can get your tickets now on
the union website (follow the links
to the Fairtrade Society Shop) or
buy them on the door. This event
would not have ben possible with-
out the generosity of Traidcraft and
PEROS who have kindly donated
some of the produce.
Fairtrade Fortnight has seen a
new event everyday at Imperial
promoting different types of ethi-
cally traded products. High pro-
file visitors have included Robert
Ekiku, a Fairtrade Tea Grower from
Uganda; Fatima Lopez, a Fairtrade
Coffee Taster from Nicaragua; Ian
Benton, Deputy Director of the
Fairtrade Foundation; Martin Hill,
Head of Commercial Relations at
the Fairtrade Foundation, Robert
Evans, MEP for London and even
Channel Four News! Thursday saw
Fairly Traded Knickers for sale in
the Union Dining Hall along with
tshirts, jewellery and recycled
games and accessories.
Thousands of free samples have
been tasted at our stalls including
tea, coffee, hot chocolate, wine, flap-
jack, cookies, cake and chocolate.
Signatures were collected to sec-
ond the Fairtrade University Policy
submitted for Union Council on
13th March and teams of Beit Hall
residents took part in the first Beit
Hall Bakeoff, creating recipes from
scratch using Fairtrade Products.
Students and staff have had the
oppurtunity to try an entirely Fair-
trade menu in the SCR and MDH on
Fridays as part of the international
counter. The occaisional Fairtrade
Football was seen kicking around
campus but due to unfortunate
weather conditions and the inevita-
ble draining problems in Beit Quad
both Beat the Goalie Competitions
were cancelled.
Before we leave you with the win-
ning recipe from the Beit Bakeoff
there is one final chance to enter
the Fairtrade Fortnight Hamper
Competition. With a hamper burst-
ing full of Fairtrade Goodies all you
need to do is fill in the Question-
naire below with your details.
You don’t even need to get the
questions right! Just email your an-
swers to clubsandsocs.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk. or alternatively you could
leave a completed version in Ben
Harris – DPEW’s pigeon hole in the
Union before Tuesday at 5pm.
