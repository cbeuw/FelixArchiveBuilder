In the centre of London there lies a
college; a college not so dissimilar
to the one you are in. Within this col-
lege there is a club; a club of climb-
ing... Nine of those from this club
set out on a journey, a journey that
would take them far from family,
friends and home across the Brit-
ish Isles, to a land of mountains and
dragons1
, a land known as Wales or
Cymru in the native tongue.
The journey started as each
journey does, with each member
packing their bags in preparation
for a week in a small (but cosy)
hut in Snowdon. They headed for
the meeting point that had been
arranged long ago, and at the un-
ion they found their transport, the
mighty white minibus which would
be captained by Dom and Matt
through their adventure.
Tragedy stuck though before they
set sail, as the fellowship lost their
first, Katie had heeded the call of
medicine and bowed out to save
those back in London, and so with
the minibus packed the remaining
seven (for one would make his own
journey at a later time) set off wav-
ing farewell to their friend.
The music started, but it was not
time to party, they zipped up their
coats and donned their head-torch-
es, as they knew the first mission
was not far from home; they had to
acquire a Christmas tree, for it was
foretold that in their destined land,
Christmas would take place and
without a tree the Christmas gods
would not smile upon their quest.
Thankfully Christmas in their
current lands had ended, and the
streets were overburdened with
discarded trees, and so staying
true to their civic duty they ridded
the street of one of its festive foli-
age. Difficult as it was to load into
the transport, the combined might
and will of those present managed
to bring it aboard; and the journey
truly began.
The first day in their new lands
the intrepid team braved the wind
and rain, and after feasting upon
their Tesco value sausages and ba-
con [or eggs in the case of young
Timothy], they headed into the out-
doors to little Tryfan.
As the road ended and the walk
began, the wind began to pick up,
but this made them only more de-
termined to get to the rock. Each
member taking their share of the
equipment, ropes, helmets, har-
nesses and gear they marched to-
wards their destiny.
Splitting up into two groups of two
and a last of three, they began their
assault on the rock. The groups
chose their route up to the top of
the foreboding rock. Dark from the
rain and enshadowed by clouds;
they climbed.
Alex and Dom were the victori-
ous two who forged their way to the
top of the challenge long before the
others and with speed on their side
the two scaled down to the bottom
of the climb, looking to conquer it
once again. Meanwhile, the others
were left lingering half way up their
routes combating the wind and rain
that had only increased with time.
The next to arrive at the top were
Matt, Laura and Bish, followed last-
ly by Tim and Henry; but it was not
the order of which they arrived that
mattered, it was the sheer fact that
they had made it to the top. They
had fought the rock and won.
As Tim and Henry began to un-
fasten themselves from their safe
positions at the top of the rock, they
were greeted by Alex and shortly
after Dom, who had managed to
easily defeat the slab a second time.
The two teams walked down to-
ter sting, but they pushed on past
the initial stage, till they found the
true path, and the sign directing
them to the top of Snowdon.
The top was subject to the all the
air that had been pushed up by the
wind, and so a gale streamed across
it; but even battered by the winds
they were determined to reach the
peak.
Once they descended from the
peak, the weather appeased, and
it was an easy walk back alongside
lakes and hills, and awaiting them
at the bottom were the rest of the
group, although wet, they had been
given chips for free and the whole
group devoured them with ease.
However their bellies were not
filled by the chips, and so they
headed for the warmest tavern they
knew of, and there gorged them-
selves on the food of the land. This
is where the eighth member of the
group, Kunal, arrived, and regaled
the awaiting others of his travelling
tales (although they will be told in
another story).
After the stories were told and the
greetings finished, the now com-
plete group travelled to their hut.
Where the medics challenge was
set upon the new arrival. The rest
of the group prepared the mattress-
es, and watched in astonishment as
Kunal reached the bedroom in one
try, feet first.
The following day Tryfan was
tackled again; however on a much
longer multi-pitch route, taking the
teams higher and further than be-
fore. The group split into two teams
of three and one of two; and set off
on their individual journeys. Little
is known of what happened along
these journeys, apart from they be-
came epics, with many difficult ma-
noeuvres over flakes, up slabs, and
the majority off route.
One team however ran into the
gether triumphant in their achieve-
ments, but the weather turned, and
the sky opened to rain down upon
them all it had drank.
At this point the team of three
were half way through their sec-
ond route up the slab, and so it was
up to the four to save everyone’s
belongings from the rain and take
shelter in the bus. Fate however
took another turn towards death as
the journey then claimed its second
victim, all the bags were out of the
rain, but Laura’s camera was still
in active service, not sheltered from
the storm, it took its final photo in
the rain, and died.
Once the days outdoor activities
were over, the indoor trials could
begin. It was proclaimed that the
medics had laid out a challenge to
their freshers to climb the ladder
joining the living room to the bed-
rooms, feet first.
So with mattresses in place, the
feat was attempted; however it was
for naught, as try as they did, they
could not manage to get higher
than half way.
This was not the only challenge
laid forth, the walls of the hut in
which they occupied were begging
for human contact; and so a route
from the floor to the ceiling was
devised, and soon after conquered,
first by Matt, but he was not alone
and soon the others followed.
On the second day it was decided
that those on the journey being
from the Mountaineering Club,
would climb a mountain; and so
they sought out the biggest moun-
tain they could find, which took
them to Snowdon.
It was an eight mile round trip to
ascend to the top and return back
to the origin, but the valiant team
clothed in waterproofs, tied their
laces tight and started the hike.
The rain hit their faces with a bit-
most trouble. After a day of making
up their own way to the top; they fi-
nally reached the peak as night fell.
This left them with the unenviable
task of making their way down in the
dark; only aided by what light their
meagre torches could produce.
As they journeyed down however,
trouble was brewing with the oth-
ers waiting. A local man started
proclaiming profanities at those
walking in the dark; resulting in
the calling of the police, who then
sat and waited for those missing to
return.
In the meantime the team scram-
bling their way down the rocks
were blissfully unaware of the trou-
ble below, singing various march-
ing songs to keep them entertained
(most coming from Disney movies);
but as they reached the bottom their
path was lit by the powerful torches
of the police car, and with a thank
you and goodbye it then drove away
leaving them in peace to hear of the
trouble they had caused.
The climbing was not the high-
light of the final day, that was left
until the evening, where on the
twelfth night Christmas took place.
Secret Santa, Christmas crack-
ers, Roast pork (chops), old jokes
and blueberry crumble for dessert
were what spurred festivities on
the last night of the long trip.
And once all the presents were
open, the new gear placed in the
hut, and all the food eaten, there
was but one thing left to do. They
had to write their entry into the
guestbook.
Hours they spent debating on
what the best words to leave as
guidance to those who would follow
in their footsteps, but it was finally
decided, and written; and with that
the tour was over, their duty done,
all that remained was the journey
back home to their loved ones.
A feast of festive mountaineering
