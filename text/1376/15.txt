I, Gamer
F
or those of you strat-
egy fans who grabbed
the new C&C demo
when it was released
last week – I hope
you’re enjoying yourself. While
you were turning the details up
to maximum ‘just to see what
happens’, I was stuck trying
to overclock the LEDs on my
DVD drive and coax the grey
box in the corner into playing
Civilization.
It happens very quickly, with
almost no warning, but one day
you wake up and the PC that
used to play the latest games
with every setting whacked to
full, now has trouble with the
latest version of Windows Me-
dia Player. Call of Duty 2 is no
longer state-of-the-art, and you
can barely play the video trail-
ers of UT2007, let alone the
game itself.
If you’re thinking about up-
grading, or just building some-
thing small from scratch, we’ve
got some help for you this
week, as well as a quick look
at the game that’ll really push
your machine. But it’s a lit-
tle depressing to look over the
“low-end” spec and discover
that most of the components
that just about manage to keep
Oblivion ticking over are now
considered to be scraping the
barrel.
It’s always worth thinking
about upgrading around this
time, though – on the brink
of a fresh wave of games that
are designed to truly test your
hardware, and just in time for
the lectures and assignments
of the year to begin to lift away.
That, and it’s easier to spend
food money elsewhere, and go
foraging in Hyde Park again
instead.
It looks like even console
gamers won’t be safe from the
ever-present demand to up-
grade though, with hardware
plug-ins promised for most
platforms, and different fla-
vours of Playstation3 and XBox
360 on the shelves.
It’s a good thing, really, if it
stops the hubbub and pressure
of console launches and PR
bickering. And it means that ri-
diculous hardware glitches and
broken promises of launch day
can still be made good on later
on in the product cycle.
Still, you can keep your per-
pixel shaders and high-dy-
namic-range lighting effects
– I’m more than happy playing
Unreal on low detail, and pre-
tending to marvel at the water
effects.
It ripples.

This week in videogaming
A rare, beautiful chance arose
this week to actually feel sorry for
Nintendo. Following week after bor-
ing week of success that Nintendo
seemed physically unable to stop,
the internet finally found something
to call the Wii’s proud parents on
this week, as Virtual Console new-
comers SNK explained that Ninten-
do was still keeping online gaming
strictly out-of-bounds for develop-
ers, and was expected to continue
in this vein for the rest of 2007.
Not that this is going to do much,
since Wii sales hit the 5 million mark
this month, with 6 million expected
to be gone by the end of March. Nor
did it stop the Business Develop-
ment Director of iD software – iD
for chrissakes – announcing that
they thought the Wii to be “fantas-
tic” and would be looking to convert
some of their games to the inno-
vative, if underpowered console.
Frankly, Nintendo should be made
to pay for nice things to happen like
everyone else. It’s disgusting.
Sony showed us how it was done
this week, peforming a Wacky Rac-
es-style U-turn on their claim that
rumble technology was “not an is-
sue” by decided that it was an issue,
and an issue that was worth paying
$150 million to resolve. To us, that
sounds like the kind of issue you
don’t accidentally say isn’t an issue.
Whether it’s enough to save the Eu-
ropean Playstation3 from being ut-
terly shunned is yet to be seen – but
the March 23 release won’t show
much of Sony’s long-term success
in the PAL regions.
Far away from the console bicker-
ing this week, though, saw a much
more grown-up kind of bickering
– the delights of the San Francisco
Games Developers Conference
has begun, with keynotes abound,
and snide remarks fired from cor-
poration to corporation. With the
Electronic Entertainment Expo
thoroughly downsized after various
failures and arguments, and ECTS
becoming a non-starter as years
went by, the GDC now stands as
the premier gaming event that the
West still plays host to.
The GDC this year will hold the
usual variety of entertaining work-
Solving Third World poverty GDC Style – Send everyone out to collect gold coins
GDC 2007 is described as “more like a frat party” than E3’s past. E3 must’ve been something dire, eh?
shops and speeches – Miyamoto be-
ing the big hitter this year, as well
as some interesting talks on gam-
ing in the third world (not an issue
on a par with, say, AIDS, but this is
a gaming conference after all) and
sex in gaming. Cutting-edge stuff.
Oh, and a design workshop on mak-
ing a game based around a needle
and thread. As we said, a premier
gaming event.
Releases this week are hot once
again – Ghost Recon: AW2 for the
360, Vice City Stories for the PS2,
Northern Strike for PC players of
the Battlefield series – truly, blow-
ing things up for no apparent rea-
son is back in fashion.
But for those of you who prefer the
other gaming options, there’s some
of 2007’s best handheld games yet
out this week, with Pirates! on the
PSP and March of the Minis, an ex-
cellent Nintendo puzzler, out on the
DS – both superb titles that show
the innovative slant that handheld
gaming continues to take.
And finally, Sony yet again befud-
dle us with another Playstation3 ad-
vert – a DEFCON serial key goes to
the most entertaining explanation
you can send in:
