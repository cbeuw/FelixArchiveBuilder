Friday 23 February

Two Fridays ago I embarked on
a mini adventure, an adventure
into the deepest, darkest depths of
Aldgate East, in the rain, and fuck-
ing freezing, wearing a T-shirt was
night the brightest idea ever. After
trying every which direction from
the tube station I managed to find
the place I was looking for; a grim
door hidden away down a deserted
side street, with a queue of bedrag-
gled looking people waiting out-
side. In front of me and my trusty
friends were three freshers staying
in Fisher, I knew this because they
were talking about Fisher - as you
do when in a queue for a club, say-
ing that they did sport one of the six
girls at Imperial, a good turn out.
So what is this queue doing in an
ally who’s main function looked like
a venue for rape and murder? Well
it was obviously the queue for Our
Disco. Our Disco? I hear you cry,
what the fuck is that? Why go out
your way and get rained on when
there is a slew of perfectly good su-
perclubs open on Friday night, full
of pillheads shit faced and dancing
to debatable music?
Simple put, it is because And Did
We Mention Our Disco? Is one of
the little known highlights of the
clubbing circuit, it’s own flavour
of electro is unmatched in qual-
ity, diversity or originality, that and
the fact most generic, loutish club
goers haven’t heard of it.
While Chalk is the new darling
of alternative clubbing, thanks to
heavy promoting by the guys be-
hind Turnmills, top acts are lost
on the poor crowd who attend, or
the vast venue it is spread across.
The more compact Durrr is mildly
better but only if your idea of fun
is hanging around with a bunch
of fashion kids who look about as
happy as if their whole family had
just died at the hands of a savage
elephant shrew. So after a hiatus of
a couple of months and a number of
venue swaps Our Disco is back un-
der the title And We Can’t Mention
Our Disco! Glyn, Den, Rory and Na-
dia front a four week run of nights
starting a on the very night in ques-
tion, hidden away at The Hub at
London Met Union. Not only that
but the subtle name change these
nights have is thanks to four top
secret acts playing on each of the
nights, who are only confirmed on
the night, when you get inside the
club - those crazy kids.
Before I completely go off on one,
endlessly praising the DJs lets take
stock of the venue. The fact it is a
students union is at first a little dis-
concerting, but on arrival you soon
realise it is a little bit different to Im-
perial’s own bars (it isn’t a building
site for a start); The Hub (recently
renamed from the Sub Club) even
has a ticketing desk and split level
bars. Upstairs you can take advan-
tage of the £3 a pint for Grolsch and
music piped up from downstairs.
The comfy leather sofas and fast
bar service is a big improvement
over Canvas, an intermediate and
horrendously over priced venue
Our Disco visited. After a bit of chin
wagging it was time to hit the floor,
the dance floor that is, sampling the
evenings secret guests.
Anyone with more than two brain
cells would probably have guessed
the secret guests well in advance,
and all our dreams and desires
were confirmed when we proceed-
ed back downstairs to find a mam-
moth poster stating ‘2MANYDJs’
in letters about as big as your face.
The last Our Disco had made the
critical mistake of running the
headliners, Simian Mobile Disco, at
the late hour of 3:30am. Luckily the
lesson had been learnt and the Bel-
gium duo came out of hiding to the
delight of the audience at a spright-
ly 1:30. The set was immense and

NIGHTLIFE nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk
featured a gamut of music from the
ever popular Gossip remix to the
brand spanking new Justice track
with the log dance floor being inti-
mate enough to make it all a little
bit special. We even saw those Fish-
er people on the dance floor, just
not dancing so much.
It is safe to say that Our Disco is
back on form, returning from the
blip was that Canvas. With the pe-
nultimate night of the run tonight,
(9th March) and any bright spark
knowing the guests will be *******
it should be pretty fricking awe-
some, so put on your glad rags and
role over to east London for a night
of glorious music.
If those Fisher Hall people are
reading this, email in and we’ll give
you a prize. Because we love you.

Trust them this week, it’s going to be even bigger
Still win tickets!
It takes a certain type of DJ to
play all night long. Rather than
whip out your set of peak time
bangers for the last two hours
you have a whole nine hours to
fill. Not only is that one heavy
bag of records, but it means a
fair amount of genre juggling.
Even the most fervent and en-
ergetic clubber might be feeling
a little jaded after nine hours of
solid minimal techno.
Mr Danny Howells, however,
is one those DJ’s who relishes
the chance to play all night.
Equipped not only with the
stamina, enthusiasm and blad-
der control to play from start
to finish, he has a record col-
lection that can keep the most
cynical, weary club-goer glued
to the dancefloor the entire
night. Never mind taking you
on a journey, it’s a full on expe-
dition requiring tent, ice pick,
provisions and a compass!
Dig Deeper always brings
that special touch of Howells
magic to the dancefloor. With
a friendly up for it crowd who
aren’t afraid to show their ap-
preciation, and a DJ whose pas-
sion for making people dance
will never tire, Dig Deeper has
grown to be an essential night
in the club calendar.
From March, Dig Deeper is
moving to a Saturday, giving you
that extra hour to take in the fin-
est selection of Deepsexyfutur-
istictechfunkhouse™ through
till 7am. Since even Danny can’t
be in three rooms at once, up in
AKA Freak Luke Soloman will
be bringing his Little Creatures
to town.

NIGHT TO WIN TICKETS!

Book into Rehab at The Roxy

The Roxy
Mondays
It’s been a while since I’ve been to
The Roxy on a Monday night. Years
in fact, I generally only go to Panic!
on a Tuesday night but I was pleas-
antly surprised this Monday when I
gave Rehab a visit.
Therecentlyre-named(previously
called Airport) club night is exactly
what you need for a cheap, fun night
out, The DJ’s Adam, Alicat, Val(Fan
Club) and Lydia(Afterskool) play a
great selection of music all night.
On first arrival (about 11:30pm)
we were greeted by an interesting
mix of 1960’s music, not quite what
we first expected but it was great
to dance to all the same. The place
was very packed compared to what
The Roxy used to be on a Monday
night before Airport took over, the
place was as full as the super popu-
lar night Panic!
This club night is basically 100%
catered for students so it’s not sur-
prising that almost everyone in
there was either at UCL, Imperial
or Kings (apart from one really old
short dude who I met, but he was
cool). It was great, I met loads of
people I knew in there.
After getting a few beers from the
bar and much drunken chatting at
the sofas, the DJ’s changed over.
End of the 1960’s set and start of the
uberpopular and great selection
of Indie and Electropop. Perfect
tracks to spend the next three hours
dancing stupidly to. The dance floor
was packed all the way to the end, I
left at 2:30am and people were still
going.
All in all, it makes a nice change
from the supertrendy DURRR and
it’s a hell of a lot better than Metro
on a Monday night. One of the
best Monday night Indie clubs in
London.
I’ll be paying them a visit again
for sure, and you should to. A small part of the Rehab flyer
