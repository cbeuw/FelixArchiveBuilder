Why would the Fellwanderers go
to the New Forest? There are no
mountains or hills it’s just full of
trees, mud, heath and ponies. Well
let me explain and hopefully by the
end of this report you will know why
the New Forest is such an amazing
place.
So it’s 5pm Friday and it seems
that I am the last to arrive at Beit
Quad even though I have organised
this trip back to my home area (I
live in the south-eastern corner).
There stand eight eager Fellwan-
derers ready to embark on the mas-
sive journey down south to the New
Forest. In just half an hour we have
the mini bus packed with Chris ar-
riving just in time. As the questions
like “have we got everyone and
everything” are running through
my head a familiar smiling face ap-
pears at the window of the bus. Its
Tim, does he want to come, no he
just wants to say good bye which is
pretty good timing. Had he been a
few minutes later we would have
been off navigating the treacherous
London rush hour to the M3.
Okay, maybe I slightly exagger-
ated the distance since we arrived
at our gourmet restaurant known
to every Fellwanderer as the ‘chip-
py’ at 8pm. I remember this being
the best fish and chip shop on the
eastern edge of the forest and with
a group of hungry students we all
know what would happen if this
was not the case (details are too
graphic). With the queue coming
out of the door and a stack of spuds
that would make any man weak at
the knees, the prospect of surviv-
ing was looking good. One delicious
pie and chips later we did what stu-
dents do best and stocked up with
fine (yes we have good taste in alco-
hol!) ale and whiskey.
Arriving at the camp site (Acres
Down Farm in Minstead) at 9pm we
then pitched the tents after a comi-
cal effort of putting the poles in the
wrong holes. Maybe I should have
tried putting the tents up in the Un-
ion first but at least now I know how
they work. Anyway, we stand around
in this muddy field not knowing
what to do since normally we are
stuck on the motorway with numb
bums thinking “are we ever going
to get there?” We got the alcohol
flowing and started to disturb the
local tranquillity; however I didn’t
drink since I was cheekily driving
to say hello to my parents (actually
I wanted a warm and comfortable
bed) only ten miles down the road.
Don’t worry, the pleasure pain
balance was restored as I needed
to get to the camp site earlier and
turf everyone else out of their tents
(not as easy as you may think). With
a warm cup of tea or two inside us
we headed towards Bolderwood
hoping that the grey clouds would
just stay grey. After seeing a herd
of deer and ending up in the mid-
dle of the woods knee high in mud,
it dawned on me that I should have
been paying more attention to the
map. No I wasn’t lost; I knew where
we were, well sort of. Now know-
ing that I need to improve my map
reading skills, we ended up outside
the Queens Arms in Burley (what a
coincidence that it just happened to
be midday).
After a quick pint or seven with
lunch we staggered for a while un-
til we soon realised that bringing a
boat would have been a good idea
since we were faced with an under-
pass that wasn’t so passable. The
day continued through more trees,
mud, and rivers (sorry about the
wet feet!) whilst being watched by
the ponies.
All of a sudden the ground began
to shake and the rumbling of hooves
started to deafen us. We jumped out
of the way as many horses bolted
from the bushes chasing after a
pack of excited dogs. Finding our-
selves in the middle of a fox hunt,
we continued. Again our progress
was hindered as we leaped into
safety to stop ourselves becoming
flattened as the second wave of
mad rich English men and women
(don’t want to get sued for lack of
equal rights) crashed through the
vegetation. Luckily the dogs had
more sense to realise that we were
not foxes and we arrived at a com-
plete fire place in the middle of no-
where. The Portuguese Fireplace,
left from the war, gave us the per-
fect opportunity to get the banner
out and argue over who had the
best whiskey (trust me we needed
it after our traumatic experience).
We closed the walk off with an epic
climb to 89 metres to admire the sun
setting behind a landscape filled
with the silhouettes of trees. Din-
ner was then enjoyed, after a short
drive to the coast, in the moonlight
with the sound of crashing waves on
the pebbles. After a little whiskey
and beer (no we’re not alcoholics; it
was just used to keep us warm) we
were gazing at the twinkling lights
from Bournemouth in one direction
and Yarmouth in the other.
Much the same happened on
Sunday until we arrived at a river
just north of Holly Hatch Inclosure
and the desire to jump overcame
me. With the first jump a success,
I wanted to beat the distance and
continue showing off. I found a man-
ageable section, took up a run and
then... ‘splash!’, water came up to
my head and my trousers were now
dripping but somehow my feet were
dry. Once the laughter had finished
everyone jumped the river to take
a short cut across the marsh. The
ground was now violently wobbling
and a local woman waking her dog
told us that we were best off cross-
ing at the bridge. Taking her advice
we all slid through a deeper patch
of bog before arriving back on the
other side. With a few wet feet our
route took us up to the top of Hamp-
ton ridge for some well deserved
lunch looking over the forest and
enjoying the view.
The walk continued along the
ridge to the dizzying heights of 124
meters (don’t laugh this is high in
New Forest terms). Our journey
took us through some spectacular
woodland with a carpet of fallen
leaves and of course a lot of mud!
With one pissed off farmer (I assure
you no fences were harmed) we en-
joyed a local pint of Fritham ale at a
very busy Royal Oak before contin-
uing across open pastures. In the
distance we spotted an ice cream
van. Were we witnessing a mirage
or had the beer gone to our heads?
Like de-hydrated men in the desert
investigation was needed. After an,
I think it was real, ice cream we left
the van to serve its regulars (the
horses).
With a not so quick go on a rope
swing and again wading through
more bog we arrived back at the
bus ready to depart to London. Eve-
ryone clambered in and strapped
down, the bus started moving back
and all was looking good. But no,
disaster had struck as the bush was
trying to knock on the window when
we realised that just revving the
engine was not helping. The more
we tried to free ourselves the more
the back slid around into the ditch,
were we ever going to get back to
London? When we gave up trying
to push the bus out, the campsite
owner came to the rescue. As if
this had happened before, her tiny
(well in comparison) Nissan pick up
truck made light work of pulling a
sliding bus out. This comical scene
gave way to a round of applause
and a few cheers with Martin look-
ing slightly embarrassed that he
had managed to get the bus stuck.
As the night drew in our weekend
had come to a close. Having seen
enough mud and horses we were
now safely on the motorway with
half of the forest stuck to the bot-
tom of our boots.
The Fellwanderers organise four
biweekly weekend trips a term to
some of the most spectacular scen-
ery in England and Wales. We also
organise Sunday walks in between
the weekends that explore the
countryside on the edge of London.

in DB’s from 12:30.
