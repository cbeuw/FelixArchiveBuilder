This year’s Night Hike was in the
same place as last years’, around
Dorking on the North Downs.
There is a Scout hut quite helpfully
placed on the outskirts of Dorking
overshadowed by Box Hill. This
year was relatively easy for the
organisers as the route had been
planned with no need to set up any
of checkpoints.
Even so after all the maps had
been printed a slight alteration was
needed as checkpoint 2 was placed
100 metres down the road from
where it should have been. The
minibus drove out and found a suit-
able clue for the new checkpoint 2.
It then started to pour, and won-
dering whether anyone would turn
up to walk around in a downpour we
started to get the hut prepared for
the night to come.
Just after 7pm, the first runner
team arrived and by 7.50pm they
were off. After a bit more of a wait
the walker’s registration opened at
8.30pm with one team turning up on
the dot. Most of the others turned
up in the two minibuses that ar-
rived around 9pm.
The competent and novice teams
could start at 9.30pm and most
teams took the time to prepare
their routes. Each of the 20 check-
points had a question associated
with it, most of the answers were on
signs or around the area so torches
were essential.
Most teams left sometime be-
tween 10 and 11pm; however the
other two runner teams waited un-
til the last moment before setting
off into the night.
Therewerethreedifferentcatego-
ries: ‘novice’, for those who weren’t
very familiar with navigation skills,
‘competent’, for those with a little
more experience, and ‘runner’, you
can guess what they do.
Novice teams had a choice of vis-
iting up to 11 checkpoints in the
area to the West, while all 20 check-
points were up for grabs for the
competent and runner teams. Most
of the teams elected to head around
the course clockwise, as this meant
they could come down Box Hill in-
stead of going up it.
A few people had to pull out dur-
ing the night due to the cold and
wet conditions; they were all met by
a rescue minibus and a warm hut
at the end of it. All but two teams
stayed within their allotted time,
with severe time penalties tak-
ing precious points away from the
teams, everyone knew they must be
back within 6 and a half hours.
Extra time was awarded for visit-
ing manned checkpoints and with
the rain pelting down most teams
took this option as it gave them a
chance to find some cover and per-
haps get a cup of tea.
The first team back was “Team
Twelve” the first runner team who
managed 14 of the checkpoints
and collected 670 points, they then
had a 2 and a half hour wait to see
whether they had won or not.
The rest of the teams arrived be-
tween 2 and 5.30am, with breakfast
being served from 5am. The last
team aptly called “Marooned” ar-
rived at 5.30 after being picked up
by the minibus at a manned check-
point. They managed to get to 9
checkpoints but were 39 minutes
late so their final score was 315
points.
It turned out that perhaps the
course was too hard this year with
no team managing to get to all the
checkpoints and so the 1000 points;
however the winners of the compe-
tent category made a good attempt
to visit 18. This gave team “Andras
Is A Gay” a total of 895 points which
was the winning score, for the win
they received beer, the smiles that
this produced made walking some
20km seem worth it.
Second place went to another
team from the Outdoor club “Burg
Is A Gay” with an impressive 850
points. Third place went to the Fell-
wanderers team “Little House On
The Prairie” with their score of 725
points.
In the Novice category an exter-
nal team “Roxy Monkey” managed
to get to all 11 of their checkpoints
and score the maximum 525 points
available. In second place team
“Edgy People” came home exactly on the dot of 6 and a half hours with
9 checkpoints visited and 445 points.
Third place went to team “ABC” as
the only managed to visit 5 check-
points and collect 260 points, they
decided to come back and get dry
after 2 and a half hours.
One runner team “Dan Is A Lady”
managed to get round 12 check-
points in just over 3 hours then
spotted the rescue minibus head-
ing his way. After wading through
the flooded road he hitched a lift
back to the dry hut. This meant he
received 560 points and the possi-
bility of receiving one of the wooden
spoon replacements for this year.
The other runner team “Joe Is A
Gay” split up with Joe coming back
to hut after a few hours and Neil
carrying on. Neil arrived back to the
hut after visiting 13 checkpoints but
with over 2 and a half hours left.
After a quick break he ventured
up to the nearest checkpoint to
level his team’s score with that of
“Team Twelve”. This meant that
that “Team Twelve” was pushed
into second place behind “Joe Is A
Gay”, with “Dan Is A Lady” coming
in third.
There were other prizes for those
placed outside the top three, these
included the ‘best lighting device’
award this year that was awarded
to the team with Christmas lights,
and a lighted disco ball. The ‘most
random object carried round’
award went to the team which man-
aged to carry a fold-up table round
with them.
The ‘best costume’ award went
without a doubt to the team that
dressed up in ponchos, moustach-
es, sombreros, and carried flam-
ing torches. These torches were on
track to win the best lighting device
as well until they went out in the
rain; hopefully they remembered to
bring other sources of light.
This year instead of wooden
spoons there were dog food sporks.
These were a brilliant find and all
the teams which won one were
deeply honoured to receive such
an award. These three teams were
“ABC”, “The Fellowship”, and “Dan
Is A Lady”.
Special mention should go to
members of the committee which
performed above their normal
roles. Paul by getting scared by a
rubber chicken, and Phil for being
a muppet and not being able to light
his stove, keep up the good work
guys.
Special thanks must go to Mark
for driving the rescue minibus, also
to Phil, Oli, and Tamsin for manning
the checkpoints, and not forgetting
Kirsty and Paul for manning the
kitchen for breakfast [Editor: I do
anything for tea].
Also thank you to the fifty-odd
competitors who took part. I hope
you had a good time and hope to see
you again next year.
