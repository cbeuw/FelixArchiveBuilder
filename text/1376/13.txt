Clint’s project that really delivers
His name may not have been in the envelope come Oscar night, but Clint still handles Letters with skill
I’m not a fan of Clint Eastwood. For
one of the most revered directors of
the past decade or so, I generally
find he has very little to say with
his films. I slept through Mystic
River the first time I tried it and
Million Dollar Baby made me want
to scratch my corneas off. It seems
that Clint’s method (and it seems
to be admired critically) is to drain
happiness from the audience but
without any real motive and little
comment by way of a theme. Hence
I was reluctant to see this but fig-
ured I’d give Clint a reprieve. And
whether it be fluke or divine inter-
vention, it seems he’s done alright.
This is the companion piece to
his Christmas release, Flags of Our
Fathers, a film about the American
landings on the Japanese island of

Iwo Jima during World War II that
disappeared from cinemas in under
a fortnight. This is essentially the
same story but while Flags told the
story from the view of the American
side, this tells the Japanese story.
Letters From Iwo Jima follows sev-
eral soldiers of different ranks of
the Japanese army as they prepare
the island for the American inva-
sion, all the time sensing they are
going to their death.
For someone who I always viewed
as lacking in artistic integrity and a
filmmaker who made films to win
Oscars and for that reason alone,
this double bill seems to be a piece
closer to his heart. Clint sets out to
have his say on the current warring
state of the world by showing how
conflict affects everyone involved.
There are no absolute enemies and
war is simply a conflict of beliefs,
he wants to say, and you’d be hard
pushed to miss it with a subtlety
just slightly more deft than Crash.
It’s an interesting perspective
for someone of an older generation
(tolerance doesn’t always come so
easily to those who lived through
the old wars) but today seems to
be on most minds. The war on Iraq
has served to make people think
about the need for conflict and the
unfortunate people caught up on
Best of the rest: What’s worth the ticket price?
Given that we’ve been sadly miss-
ing film reviews for the past few
weeks, we understand that we have
left you, the trusty Felix reader,
completely unaware of what is on
out there. Without knowing what’s
good, without knowing what eve-
ryone’s talking about and without
knowing what is actually worth your
student loan. But put your fears to
one side now, as here’s a low-down
on some of the offerings to get your-
self along to and give that revision a
miss for another couple of hours, as
well as a couple to avoid.
First up, The Good Shepherd.
Not so good. This is the incredibly
long new film from Robert De Niro,
his third foray into directing, and
is a piece that has definite echoes
of The Godfather. This influence
seems to be quite natural for De
Niro who won an acting Oscar for
his part in the sequel, but The Good
Shepherd seems to do the opposite
to what made The Godfather so
interesting.
both sides, so does Clint’s message
come across as revolutionary?
Well, no. But the film is his best
I’ve seen so far and the impend-
ing doom of the piece is foreshad-
owed in every frame of Letters. It’s
refreshing to see a film that isn’t
saluting the Star Spangled Banner
throughout and although I missed
Flags when it was released, the im-
age I got of it was more one of an-
guish on the part of the soldiers, not
pride at defeating the Japanese. It
seems America has entered the age
of self-reflectivity and can look at
itself in a more objective way than
the air-punching nationalism of In-
dependence Day or Armaggedon.
Sounds like progress to me.
So is the film any good? Yes. Clint
is a dab hand with a camera and it’s
interesting to watch the characters
develop through the letters of the ti-
tle and careful exposition through-
out. There’s lots of blood thrown in
there for good measure and the fo-
cus is definitely on the humanity of
war, not the insanity of it that films
of Vietnam seized on (think Apoca-
lypse Now, Full Metal Jacket). The
CGI landing itself means it lacks
the realist impact of, say, Saving
Private Ryan but is necessary for
the scale of the attack.
The characters are the most im-
portant part here though as with-
out them the whole meaning of
the piece collapses, and the view
through the eyes of a young baker,
summoned to war away from his
wife and unborn child, proves to be
the most arresting despite seeming
a tiny bit contrived.
Altogether, it’s dubious how this
will stand up against the great
collection of war films out there
already, and either we believe we
have seen all the atrocities before
or we accept that we’ll never have a
true picture of life on the front line.
How much this adds to the mix is
debatable, but don’t write it off as
hollow Eastwood Oscar fodder.
That’s not to say it wasn’t, but it
doesn’t tick the same obvious boxes
as the others. Maybe that explains
the Scorsese sweep this year.
“Clint, if you make us watch Million Dollar Baby one more time …”
Letters From ★★★★✩
Iwo Jima
Director: Clint Eastwood
Writer: Iris Yamashita
Cast: Ken Watanabe,
Kazunari Ninomiya,
Tsuyoshi Ihara
Banjo Kennedy By this I mean the way in which
it portrayed organised crime as
running in an identical manner to
a business organisation. What this
film does is to show the early CIA as
operating in much the same way as
organised crime, a brutal tale that
asks how far are you willing to go
for something.
If only they’d asked it faster. In-
stead there are almost three hours
of political debate, punctuated with
scenes of domestic hell between
Matt Damon as the young CIA op-
erative and Angelina Jolie, his wife.
These moments come as a wel-
come break from the political on-
slaught that permeates everything
else, and everything seems more
dragged out so that De Niro could
wedge in more characters to be
played by an arsenal of thesps and
award nominees.
This name grabbing only serves
the film badly, despite their good
performances, as it never totals the
sum of its parts.
Much better is The Last King
of Scotland, which is still playing
in a cinema near you. This would
run and run if it were theatre, and
rightly so. With performances to
scare and endear you simultane-
ously, moments that sicken and
amuse you and a story of misplaced
power and hope that resonates in
whatever era, this is high quality
cinema.
James McAvoy shows that young
British talent doesn’t mean Keira
Knightley and seems to be hot
property at the moment, in cin-
emas again this week with Becom-
ing Jane. Let’s hope he gets back
to edgier things like this in the near
future, however.
Most people I know have seen it
on word of mouth due to a lack of
coverage in awards ceremonies
(besides Forest Whitaker) which
I feel is inexplicable. Try it and it
may prove to be the sleeper hit that
you’ve been waiting for under all
the overhyped rubbish around.
One film that may have escaped
attention by not being advertised
to saturation point is Orchestra
Seats, an easy going French of-
fering that has a lot of heart but
not much else. It’s sweet enough,
centring on a young girl whose life
weaves around three other charac-
ters who work in different art fields
but all feel slightly unfulfilled.
It’s interesting and has a light
tone that would be suited to a lazy
Sunday afternoon, so this may be
an option if you don’t fancy the in-
volved politics of the previous two
options here.
Music and Lyrics is the other
piece of the puzzle here so that
hopefully there’s something for
everyone. Well, at least there would
be if this one had something good
to offer up.
As far as chick flicks go, you pret-
ty much know what your getting
when Hugh Grant comes on the
packaging. Sadly, here the joke just
seemed to be wearing a bit thin and
he didn’t have the spark that made
him so popular in the 90s.
The plot basically sees him strug-
gling to find lyrics for some music
he’s written and it just so happens
Drew Barrymore can do that with
ease. Phew, otherwise we might
run low on story here …
For a film called Music and Lyr-
ics, the music doesn’t make you
want to throw down your handbag
and dance around it ladies, and
there are times when it just drags
on and on until you wish you were
watching MTV so you could change
channel.
This was never going to be Citizen
Kane though; it’s meant to be fun.
Sadly, the comedy aspect, whilst
providing a few laughs, seemed to
have gone AWOL for the majority,
meaning the “rom” was left sans
“com”. Not really one for the DVD
collection, but there’s plenty to talk
(i.e. complain) about afterwards if
you want a suitable, low-IQ, first-
date movie.
Other than these, be sure to
check out previously reviewed fare
such as Notes on a Scandal and
The Queen that are still bounc-
ing around. And if none of those fit
your personal tastes, then hopefully
there will be something more for
you next week. Miserable gits.
Angelina taunts a class geek; Cecile de France loses “Guess the City”; Forest wears this season’s must-have: tartan and khaki; Hugh stammers through Drew’s touchy feely crap
