300
Based on the comic book
300, about the histori-
cal event of the Battle
of Thermopylae. 300
Spartans fought against
Xerxes and his massive
Persian army. Also, there
are lots of half-naked sol-
diers. Sounds like a good
film right? Although if I
was in a massively out-
numbered army of 300,
I would at least bother
putting on armour. Just to
up the odds a little.
Giles Deacon @ New
Look
Awesome, another
designer diffusion range.
Launching on the 13th,
Deacon's "Gold" range will
include jackets, dresses,
shoes and accessories.
Gold is more substantial
than other diffusion rang-
es, at around 35 pieces.
This isn't just a limited
edition range; Deacon's
contracted to design col-
lections throughout this
year.
Excessive media cover-
age of Britney Spears
How does Britney Shav-
ing her head warrant a
front page? Although,
hypocritically, I have to
say that allegedly: after
writing 666 on her head,
she ran around her rehab
facility screaming, "I am
the antichrist". She then
allegedly tried to hang
herself with her bed-
sheets. I wish her well.

We in London are lucky to be able
to express ourselves freely when it
comes to fashion. You can't talk on
the tube, but while not talking on
the tube, you can wear whatever
the fuck you want.
Some people may think fashion is
a frivolous affair, perhaps they think
there are more pressing concerns
in life. However, in this slothful,
individualistic age, fashion is actu-
ally a useful way to burn money and
perpetuate the consumerist cycle.
Oh, I may joke about the pointless-
ness of fashion, but imagine a world
without it. We might as well walk
around blind to the beauty of the
world. Everybody has the potential
to realise their own personal style.
Express yourself and spread your
fashion memes around the world.
That said, some people need some
tips to hone their style. You can call
these people... students who go to
Imperial. Joke! Not really.
Tips for acheiving style nirvana:
Stick to your style. Once you've
defined your look, don't buy any-
thing thing not prescribing to it.
This requires a degree of fashion
will-power. No matter what a find it
is, if it doesn't go with all the other
clothes in your wardrobe, it is a
waste of money. You will never wear
it. Only celebrities can buy anything
they set their cold, dead eyes on,
because they have too much money
to burn.
Lindsay Ho-han may have a
wardrobe as big as my apartment,
but her style is also disposable.
What happened to the great fash-
ion icons like Audrey Hepburn who
kept a signature look throughout
their careers? That is what to as-
pire towards.
Don't buy items in multiple col-
ours. The more of an item you have,
the less exciting it is to wear. Like
everything in life, if you have too
much of something, you begin to
feel passive-aggressive towards it.
Think of opportunity cost (an excel-
lent fashion philosophy) two differ-
ent tops is better than the same top
in two colours.
Buy colours that complement
your skintone. Don't bother with
Autumn, Winter bullshit, it's much
easier than that. Look in the mirror.
If your skin tone looks washed out,
then that colour doesn't suit you,
you must never buy anything in that
colour again. Alternatively stop us-
ing alcohol as a social crutch, and
eat something with more nutrition-
al value than toast.
Don't follow trends too closely.
Not all trends fit all body shapes
so don't follow fashion slavishly. My
eyes are still recovering from the
horror of the cropped top trend of
Victoria Beckham, a definite lack
of personal style
Lindsay Lohan, souless style
Russell Brand, 'xciting!
Audrey Hepburn, timeless
Andre 3000, hey ya! Rachel Bilson, woof woof
The Love London fashion show,
organised by students of Imperial
College London, incorporates a
wide variety of stunning clothing
andcurrententhusiasmaboutour
city. The event will take place on
Tuesday 20th of March at 'Ham-
mersmith Palais', which is lo-
cated on Shepherd’s Bush Road,
London, W6. 'Hammersmith Pal-
ais de Danse' was opened in 1919,
making it one of the oldest ven-
ues in London, complementing
the selected theme perfectly.
This is a fundraising event with
the chosen charity being Demel-
za House, an organisation provid-
ing hospice care for over 450 chil-
dren with life-limiting illnesses
and their families, across Kent,
East Sussex and South London.
These children are not expected
to reach their 19th birthday, due
to their incurable illnesses. As
well as providing hospice care,
Demelza provide hospice care
at homes, planned short breaks,
emergency respites, therapies,
symptom control, end of life care
and bereavement support. It is vi-
tal that these children receive the
care and support they deserve in
order to ensure they are comfort-
able as their conditions worsen.
Their website can be found at
www.demelzahouse.org.
Love London's aim is to raise
an excess of £8,000 for this most
worthwhile cause; exceeding last
year’s total from a successful
outing at Pacha in Victoria, which
was held in aid of Chase Hospice.
Previous supporters have includ-
ed Voyage, TM Lewin, Jigsaw,
Ghost, Diesel, Boyd, Zara, LK
Bennett, Space NK, Pepe Jeans,
Calvin Klein, Urban Outfitters,
Paul Smith, Question Air and
Laundry Industry.
Toni and Guy aided Love Lon-
don with their creative hairstyl-
ing expertise, Space NK provided
the makeup and Deloitte and
Ernst Young generously spon-
sored the event. The evening
achieved coverage in the local
and national press including Met-
ro, Tatler, The Evening Standard,
The Daily Mail, TimeOut London
and Vogue.

the 90's. So many flabby, teenage
mother, chav guts.
Wearmake-up.ThisisfortheMs.s.
Wearing a bit of mascara doesn't
undo the suffrage. Use make-up to
emphasise your good points, but
don't paint a new face on.
Wear nice underwear. Throw
away all underwear which has no
classifiable colour or fraying elas-
tic. If you wear grey granny pants,
no matter how awesome the out-
fit on top, you know the truth. Buy
yourself happiness with some nice
pants. Aussiebum does the coolest
guy's underwear (www.aussiebum.
com/en). Of course, for women
there's always Topshop's 3 for £7.
(But don't you always get stuck on
the third pair?)
Read fashion magazines for in-
spiration. You don't even have to
bother reading the articles in most
of them! Just look at the pretty pic-
tures. I recommend Pop (although
there tends to be a high ratio of flesh
to actual clothing. Some might say
that's a good thing), i-D, Glamour,
Vogue, Vice (www.viceland.com).
For more obscure foreign fashion
titles, the Waterstones on Charing
Cross road stocks a large selection.
Know that not all high street
branches are equal. What is stocked
at each store is up to the store man-
ager, some have better selections
than others. These are the best high
street branches: Primark, Ham-
mersmith; Topshop, Oxford Circus;
H&M, 360 Oxford Street; New Look,
500 Oxford Street; Urban Outfit-
ters, High Street Kensington; Zara,
Knighstbridge.
Don't let your outfit down with
your choice of shoes. Dorothy Per-
kins is an unsung hero for decent
quality, cheap shoes. Office and
Schuh are the best for cool every-
day shoes. Size? on Carnaby Street
has the best selection of ridiculous-
ly priced, "limited edition" trainers.
Buy individuality at vintage shops.
There's practically a small village of
vintage shops around Brick Lane
and Commercial Street in the East
End. (There's also the fashion mar-
ket at Spitalfields, Sundays, 9am
– 5pm). The Seven Dials area in
Covent Garden is also a good place
for vintage shops; you can find Pop
on 6 Monmouth Street.
The most important tip; only trust
your own opinion. If you like some-
thing, then wear it. What really
matters is how your clothes make
you feel, not other people's opinion
of them.
