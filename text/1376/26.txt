6 Rook takes Bishop, heads to

It’s pronounced “Tar-co”, not
“Taco”, not “Tar-cow” and certainly
not “Texaco”. Those money grab-
bing bastards. I was so glad when
BP and Shell became the front run-
ners in the oil industry. What do you
mean they’re not? Shove it up your
ChemEng arse.
Anyway, now that’s out of the way,
I hope you enjoy the crossword as
much as I had fun typing out every
little word. As you can see, I was
rather enthusiastic with the amount
of clues I’ve dished out. 4, 5 or 6 let-
ter ones so that the editor has as
much trouble as I can muster when
he comes to format my crossword.
Oh how I laugh.

managed to work out that 27 across was ‘speiss’. But then, he’s a math-
ematician, so you’d expect him to be able to solve clever shit like that.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
(Hmm... that felt
pretty harsh...)
...
(Should I leave it... or
change the “uglier than” compari-
on to something less offensive?)
Ho hum.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
Returning to the
fashion page... if I
have to Unsharp
Mask another picture
of yet another mincing
queer fashion design-
er who is ironically uglier than a
downs syndrome burns victim, I’m
going to rape Sarah Skeete with a
coxless rowing boat.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
I think my beard is a
parasite. It’s sucking
all of the weight out of
me. Really, I’m wast-
ing away - before long
I’ll be all Beard and
no Intruder. I’m going to kill it to
death, like it deserves, the fucking
bastard. Though I’ll wait until it
takes off a few more pounds first.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
This week you actu-
ally read the fashion
page. Not only that,
you actually feel like
buying something
from the fashion page
when you really should be putting
the money towards little Timmy’s
blood transfusion operation. Oh
well, he always was a little fucker.
This Week’s Rocky Horror Show
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
This week you feel
inspired. This week
the horoscopes come
to you quickly. At-
tempts to make a sick,
puerile joke based on
the male gamete seeping from the
weave of the newspaper fail miser-
ably. You are ridiculed by the rest
of the staff.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
This week you eat
a bit too much junk
food. You discretely
attempt to progres-
sively squeeze out a
silent one... but oh!
Too far! Brown patty in the pants!
You even do a slight wee out of
your front bottom. Do you dash and
risk dribble or sit and hold the fort?
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
Oh hell yeah, that’s
the bottom line, ‘cos
Stone Cold said so!
(Cue hundreds of
wobbling, jelly bellied
Americans throwing
their hands in the air, screaming).
Ah, the days of watching WWF.
Tombstoning my younger brother
shouldn’t have been that much fun.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
This week your hair
manifests itself as
a living, breathing
entity. Awaking to
find it polishing your
Clarks shoes, you be-
gin conversing with the barnet. Oh
dear, you went there. You said the
‘T’ word. Toupee. You’re swallowed
and spat out as a fur ball.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
This week you do ac-
tually win the election.
You are so relieved
you have an angry
wank but because
you’re actually not
angry and in fact mightly pleased
it all goes horribly wrong. SNAP
GOES THE BANJO STRING.
HAHAAhaahaHAHAaha.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
There was an election
the other week. No,
not last week - the oth-
er other week. Weren’t
you paying attention,
you spanners? Any-
way, I didn’t win it, so I’m sulking
now. You bitchplates should have
voted for me, then I’d be running
this place. Like a crack-house.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Oh look, the results for
the post of President
07-08 are going to be
announced on Thurs-
day supposedly. Tune
in to the front page,
RIGHT NOW to find out whether
this is fact or fiction horoscope
fans. Or pick up your nearest
conch shell for more information.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
You lucky bastards
have the best star
sign - fuck’s sake, it’s
called “cancer” - how
fucking boss is that?
And only a virgin with
no imagination would fail to recog-
nise what’s going on in that symbol
up there. Hang on, look who I’m
talking to. Never mind. Loser.
