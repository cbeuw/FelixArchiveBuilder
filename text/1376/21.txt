Jazz and rock. And blues. And
metal. And folk, indie, alt., acous-
tic, punk... The list goes on. But it
doesn’t make a very snappy name.
Probably why our founding fathers
in their infinite wisdom shortened
it to Jazz and Rock. And hence
prompting the timeless question:
“What if I don’t like jazz or rock?”
So first off, let me assuage your
fears; any musical style is welcome
here. No really, it is. So there. We
run a well-equipped practice room
in the west wing basement of the
Union, cheap as hell and available
to all our members, and we also
regularly hold gig and jam nights
in dB’s.
Our gig nights are all about giving
talent from Imperial (and some-
times further a field) a chance to
get out there and play, any style
and any level of previous live ex-
perience are usually welcome. Our
jam nights are, somewhat more
relaxed. Whether you want to do
covers (Hey Joe and Master of Pup-
pets are usually mandatory at some
point), a 15 minute 12 bar blues jam,
or even a solo acoustic set, all you
need do is bring down an instru-
ment (be it guitar, violin, saxophone
or pizza box, yes, I said pizza box),
and make some noise and have
some fun.
We recently held Friday Night
Live, one of our larger termly
events. Five great bands took to
the stage of dB’s ‘til late, with drink
aplenty, helped what turned out to
be a great night with an excellent
atmosphere. First to the stage was
the funk-rock of Reality Cheques,
and they were followed by the
crushing heaviness of Death Pen-
alty (No one survives ©2007), who,
astonishingly didn’t empty the room
and even managed to get a mosh pit
going! Twice!
Next up came the soulful styling
of Luca Laraia who held an abso-
lutely packed DB’s rapt for his 35
minutes on stage. He was followed
by the only non-Imperial band of the
night, the up and coming melodic
rockers Cato Street Conspiracy, a
name which you should certainly
be on the look out for in the future.
To close the night were our very
own blues rockers, White Elephant,
stalwarts of Jazz and Rock, supply-
ing their own share of cool for the
evening.
Last Tuesday, 6th of March, we
had our, ahem, ‘Varsity’ Rock Off,
which you may note came the night
before a certain college event, from
which we have in no way borrowed
a name from for reasons of publicity.
Anyway, we pitted two medic bands,
being Honour Amongst Thieves
and Dirty Frank, against two of
their non-medic counterparts,
Death Penalty and White Elephant,
in a battle to find who rocked the
hardest, fastest, and most. [Editor
– from the over enthusiastic gestic-
ulations of one of my house mates I
can only assume they managed to
at least please the crowds.]
Clash of the Century
Saturday 10th March,
6.45pm – 2am
dB’s, ICU, £3 entry
Our other big event this term is
our way of celebrating the college
centenary Jazz and Rock style. It’s
on March 10th and we’ve called it
‘Clash of the Century’, and it is ba-
sically a battle of the bands equiva-
lent of the Royal Rumble. Almost 20
bands will take to the stage over the
course of the night. Some old hands
whom you’ve seen before and whom
we’ve mentioned earlier, no doubt,
and some new faces, all vying for
the title of Imperial’s greatest band.
The battle lines are well and truly
drawn, so come on down, pick your
side and get ready to make some
noise, as we try our hardest to rock
the Union to its very core.
So much more than just jazz and rock. Grown men gently weeping into microphones too

As many of you will know, the sec-
ond annual Ethical Careers Exhibi-
tion took place in the Great Hall last
Wednesday. The idea was to show-
case careers that lead to something
more than just a decent salary and
a company car, focussing on careers
that make a positive difference to
the world.
Companies included Transport
for London, the energy consultancy
ESD, and PowerPerfector, makers
of energy efficient technology, to
name just a few. There were also
representatives from student so-
cieties such as Engineers Without
Borders, with free tea and cof-
fee samples provided by Imperial
Fairtrade.
The usual stalls and freebies were
supplemented by a series of semi-
nars ranging from the potential of
fuel cell technology to opportuni-
ties for volunteering in India and

turning an entire village ‘carbon
neutral’.
Although the turnout was smaller
than last year, and the stalls were
fewer, the atmosphere was great.
A lot of the recruiters commented
on how interested and interesting
Imperial students were. Appar-
ently we came across as enthusi-
astic, thoughtful and well prepared,
which is encouraging to hear.
I was personally pretty amazed at
how many people came to the semi-
nars, since half an hour at lunch
time is a valuable thing. It was
worthwhile to many, though; two
quantum physicists who attended
the talk on Finding an Ethical ca-
reer in Science, Design and Tech-
nology told me ‘We both didn’t like
the ordinary careers fair with Brit-
ish Petroleum and the Ministry of
Defence.’ For them, like many oth-
ers, ethics is paramount in career
choice.
However, for some Imperial stu-
dents, choosing a career is about
balancing priorities. Most of us care
about sustainability and social jus-
tice, but for many this fades into in-
significance in the face of the pres-
sure to find a job – any job – that will
pay the bills.
A student from the Engineers
Without Borders stand admitted to
me that she has a job lined up from
a year in industry scheme she did
in her gap year before university,
before she had come to care about
ethics. Now her ideas have changed
– but she’s still taking the job, with-
out checking on the company’s
ethical record. It’s just too time-
consuming for a final-year student
to go job-hunting.

That is why the Ethical Careers
Exhibition is so important. There
are plenty of companies out there
doing exciting, worthwhile work,
(some of them pay pretty well too),
and they all want to recruit dedi-
cated graduates with a fabulous
science education. If you wander
through a room filled with those
companiesyou’reboundtocomeout
with a dozen possibilities that you’d
never have considered before.
So support our Ethical Careers
Exhibition! This year it was organ-
ised by students for students, and
some people worked very hard and
put in a lot of time to make it hap-
pen. Now, because of the event’s
success, the Union staff might be
lending a hand, but we still need
volunteers to make the 2008 event
bigger, better and more useful, to
help more of us find the job we re-
ally want, not the one we’re settling
for.
So, if you are interested in helping
out next year, please email us at
