After a dissappointing result the
previous weekend, IC Mens 1st XI
had a point to prove.
With previous IC records stand-
ing at a 26-0 win and having already
demolished Kings 18-0 away this
season, IC only had one target in
mind when arriving at the Fortress
– goals, goals, and goals!
Captain Harvester, having al-
ready managed numerous double
figure victories this season, made
sure the team knew the game plan
– “lets put this game away in the
first 10 minutes!”. And that is what
his troops did racking up atleast
five goals in the first quarter of an
hour.
The goal flurry came with clini-
cal precision from the tasked strike
force. The first few went in with an
unbelievable air of ease. With an
IC victory on the cards again, the
recovering Star Wars and Foetus
were given a break till half time.
Sensing an easy game ahead and
perhaps his only chance at goal
pie this season, Harvester quickly
made a tactical decision to place
himself at centre forward and with-
in a couple of minutes had excit-
edly rifled one in from close range.
Goals kept on pouring past the
Kings goalie (who was by now act-
ing as an innocent by-stander) from
Ratty, Jumanji and Toady.
The team managed to keep their
heads, moving the ball well and giv-
ing Kings absolutely no chance off
respite. Half-time was blown, which
gave the umpires the chance to
sharpen their pencils and count the
score so far – 13-0! A new strategy
was dreamt up in a matter of sec-
onds. It was time to put this game
into the record books.
Another half like the first would

bring us close to the record. Har-
vester and Ratty took a rest bring-
ing Star Wars and Foetus back into
the fray. Toady kept it tight from
behind whilst the rest of the team
swarmed the field in a frenzy of goal
hunger.
Goals came quicker than ever
in the second half; Sid notched up
yet more for this season, Shipman
slotted one in net for his first this
season and Naked Tube Rider even
put one away on his debut. Further
goals came from Foetus and Date
Rape as the magic 26th goal was
put away.
Harvester and Ratty moved back
into the mix in place of Shipman and
Krusty. With 20 minutes remaining
it was time to enforce a power play
on Kings so IC removed their goal-
ie, with Plug to increase the torrent
of pressure on the opposition.
Time to make this game histo-
ry! Up stepped Batty to the mark
putting his goal away to make it 27-
0 and a new record.
Star Wars continued the scoring
frenzy along with Krusty, crafting
some moments of hockey genius.
The final score was 32-0. Yes, they
had 11 players. Yes, this time they
had a goalie. Yes, they knew which
end of the stick to hold. No, they
weren’t blind! Great performance
from the Mens 1s to keep playing
team hockey, even well into a dou-
ble-figure victory.
Well done boys, the record books
are ours for a while yet. A devastat-
ed RSM proceeded to the Union to
drown their sorrows, and plan their
Bottle recovery mission to Cam-
borne next year.
