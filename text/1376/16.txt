Phantasy Star – Way before WoW
You think 70 is impressive? Robin Andrews was hitting level caps while you were figuring out WASD
H
ow do you kill that
which has no life?”
asks a terrified tech-
nician working at Bliz-
zard Entertainment.
Apparently someone has been play-
ing World of Warcraft for so long
that they have levelled up beyond
the boundaries of the game; as a re-
sult, this could very well be the End
of the World of Warcraft.
Don’t panic. Whereas this scenar-
io has been lifted from an episode
South Park, this is probably never
going to happen; but it does show
just how much the “online phe-
nomenon” has infected pop culture
– played by as many people in the
world as live in Switzerland.
However, long before Azeroth
was created, aeons before the first
online character levelled up for the
first time, there was another online
world which became the foundation
of all MMORPGs that exist today.
For anyone who’s ever mashed
the A-button to cut down hordes of
flying robots, fired a shot into a poor
little Rappy or electrocuted the
mighty Dark Falz with a Razonde
you will know what I’m talking
about. Phantasy Star had returned
to the (then) new generation of
gaming consoles, but with some-
thing decidedly different from the
usual role-playing fare.
Console gamers were promised
with a persistent, constantly-evolv-
ing world with thousands of players
from all around the world at any
time participating. Although this
was not the first game to have the
capability to do so, it is indubita-
bly the game that has provided the
template for many of the epic sub-
scriber-rich games one can play to-
day. Phantasy Star Online was un-
leashed upon the world – literally.
I remember my first experience
of this strange new type of game:
incredibly excited by the prospect
of an epic role-playing game online,
and being a true console gamer
through and through, I rushed out
to buy my copy and encouraged ev-
eryone I knew who could pick up a
controller to do so.
I started off as a meek Hunter,
or HUmar (a human close-combat
specialist),andafterfollowingmuch
higher level – and mostly Japanese
– avatars around the game, I start-
ed to level up, despite being repeat-
edly crushed under the feet of the
world’s multiple bosses. Eventually
I had grasped the idea of forming
a party of online gamers that I got
to “know” through the pre-voice
chat text messaging system, which
frequently littered the screen with
comments ranging from “Watch
out for the Delseban horde!” to the
less-helpful “OMG u r teh n00b.
WHY DIDN’T U HEAL!!!” Amus-
ingly the text system attempted to
reduce the level of swearing and
cursing to such an extremely
sensitive degree the word Sat-
urday appeared as Sa****ay.
The real-time combat and lev-
elling up principle was simple
even back in 2000, but fighting
alongside other people rather
than non-player characters
proved far more exciting and
interesting. The levels were
linear and the enemy AI was
very predictable but the
sheer range of weapons,
rare items, and enemies
themselves meant that
this game stood out in
the bland old guard
of shoot-em-ups and
racers.
There are four as-
pects of this game
whichformemade
it one of the most
memorable to
play and some-
thing which all
game devel-
opersaspired
to recreate.
The first is
that scary,
shaky
time you
come
across the game’s final
bosses, either Dark Falz or
Olga Flow. Usually this hap-
pens when you are a very
low level character being
protected by other, much
higher level babysitters.
You seem to stand there in
amazement at this enor-
mous creature you would
never have been able to
reach on your own, watch-
ing helplessly as it takes
cheap shots at you and
ultimately requires your
guardians to repeatedly
heal you or just ignore you.
When you come back to this
incarnation of pure, gaming
evil much later in the game with
far more experience, it is incredibly
satisfying to take it out yourself.
Only in an online role-playing situ-
ation could you attempt at taking
down a final boss just as you have
started the game, giving you an
insight as to how far you have yet
to progress.
The second aspect is undoubt-
edly the obsession with finding rare
items. Personally, I spent many
a day, night and groggy morning
grinding the virtual world with oth-
er equally-dedicated button mash-
ers trawling through dungeons and
defeating creatures on ridiculously
high levels in order to obtain a sin-
gle, incredibly rare weapon. Even
after this weapon was found I was
told of another, even more power-
ful item that I may be interested in
by a level 200 veteran of the game,
a player who had yet to find it him-
self. The days of the week blurred
into one very rapidly: you just had
to be the best; there was no ques-
tion about it.
Thenthere’stheslow,steady,pain-
ful transition from crawling to walk-
ing, as it were. When you became
strong and co-ordinated enough to
actually command a party of Hunt-
ers and take on the game’s more
difficult regions, it brought with it
an overwhelming sense of achieve-
ment: what seemed like years ago
you were nothing. Now you have fi-
nally evolved into a grown newbie.
There was still, clearly, a long way
left to go before you would see ev-
erything PSO had to offer.
But the prime reason for play-
ing this revolution in role-playing
games has to be the community
aspect of it. Not only could you talk
to people as happy to spend a large
portion of their life in a non-existent
reality as you, but the whole idea of
having a player economy for selling
and trading items, the brilliant lob-
by system, and the constantly evolv-
ing world gave you every reason to
log on every time you sat in front of
your television – the MMO ‘X-Fac-
tor’ that makes it money today.
Unbelievably, it’s true: there was
a game released prior to WoW
which ruined as many gamers’ so-
cial life as it has. The game simply
had to many levels to achieve, too
many secrets to hunt down, and
too many personalities to slash and
hack through the hordes of enemies
with. Even the little robot, your own
personal MAG, which you had hov-
ering behind you throughout the
game proved to be a source of ad-
diction in itself: it could level up,
arm itself and even enhance your
own abilities.
Phantasy Star Online’s servers
are to go offline after seven years
of providing many gamers with
the fantasy world prior to which
they could only dream of. All of the
above reasons of why this game is
so legendary are the core aspects
of any modern MMORPG, and PSO
deserves to be praised.
If you are the type of gamer who
looks back on this game with a dis-
tinct feeling of nostalgia, (in other
words refer to money as Meseta
and believe that a Rappy bears a
striking resemblance to your pet
canary), the next time you see your
neighbour stumble into his room af-
ter another WoW-induced sleepless
night, you can safely claim that you
were there from the beginning.
