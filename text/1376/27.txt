The BUSA Table Tennis Individual
Championships was one tourna-
ment in the calendar that we could
not afford to miss. Having spent the
past few only playing in the Central
London league, it was finally time
for us to get back into the midst of
inter-university table tennis.
Armed this year with the strong-
est squad to date, six of us were sent
to Nottingham to represent IC in 4
categories - men’s singles, men’s
doubles, women’s singles and wom-
en’s doubles. The tournament was
a 2-day event with the preliminar-
ies on Saturday while on Sunday;
the finals of all these events were
played. Upon arrival at the sports
hall, the sight of 18 playing tables
was indeed impressive and daunt-
ing at the same time. To challenge
with the very best of universities in
the country is something new to us.
Since it was our first entry, we did
not set ourselves any targets but
vowed to play our very best for the
college.
We soon got under way and both
our pairs in the men’s doubles
made it to the second round where
it turned into another Imperial vs.
Cambridge affair when we were
drawn with ‘those guys again’. Cam-
bridge currently sits on top of the
table in the premier division of the
BUSA league and it seemed that
they wanted us to know that as they
ended our interest in this event.
Anusha and Nan as our sole rep-
resentatives in the women’s dou-
bles put in an impressive display of
table tennis and looked unstoppable
on their way to the semi-final to win
us our first medals of the tourna-
ment. They went out at this stage to
eventual winners Embling/Brown
of Essex.
In the men’s singles event, Ko
Chi and Wei Lun faced some pretty
tough opposition in their prelimi-
nary groups and were unlucky not
to qualify. Serkan and I fared better
and made it through qualifying to
the knockout stages where I went
out to Cambridge’s Stanley Zhang.
Serkan made it to the second round
and was unlucky to face the number
1 seed Adam Bleakley so early on
and went out in the last 32.
Focus then turned to the wom-
en’s singles. First up was Anusha
who finished second in her prelimi-
nary group. We could have wished
for a better draw when she came
through another preliminary match
to set up a meeting with number 1
seed Egle Adomelyte in the knock-
out stages where she lost in three
close sets. Nan had to play number
2 seed Abigail Embling in her first
group and while leading 2-1 in sets,
was on the verge of a huge upset
when Embling staged a comeback
to take the final two sets. Nan lost
another close match 3-1 and this
placed her third in the group.
Our last chance for some med-
als was in the plate. Only Wei Lun
and Nan entered this event and we
came so close to making it a double.
Wei Lun fell at the semi-final stage
to Jade Blasse of Middlesex. Nan
looked invincible on her way to the
final where she blew away Pene-
lope Sawa of Southampton to add
some more silverware to our cabi-
net in Ethos.
It was unlucky that some of us
had been drawn against the top
seeds very early in the competition,
but we left feeling satisfied with our
performances and commitment.
Moreover, we had managed to win
silverware in our very first attempt.
Although there is still a difference
in technical skills between the best
players and us, there is plenty of
room for us to improve for next
season.
In contrast to the lack of training
facilities in previous seasons, the
presence of complete facilities at
Ethos will benefit us greatly in the
future. In addition, we would like to
thank Sport Imperial for their kind
sponsorship and continued support
for the team. We are looking for-
ward to next season as we prepare
to enter the BUSA leagues and will
return to the championships next
year hoping to bring back some
more trophies!

This year has seen the start of the
ULU mixed lacrosse cup following
the growing competitiveness of the
league involving teams from across
the London universities.
With seven teams entering the
cup, and the added incentive of be-
ing the first winners of this compe-
tition, enthusiasm and determina-
tion were high. IC lacrosse were
drawn with a very tough first round
match against Royal Holloway 1sts
who are currently sitting at the top
of the league.
After a valiant team effort they
arose triumphant (8-4) after a hard
fought match. Everybody played
an excellent game and man of the
match went to Sam Jayaweera for
some outstanding work at the back
in defence.
The second round opponents
were huge rivals King’s and this
was to be played on the weekend
of the medics Rag Dash. So with a
new look team we went apprehen-
sively to Honor Oak Park to face a
very strong opposition.
IC played some fantastic lacrosse,
with some very attacking and also
excellent defensive play, deserved-
ly ended up 4-3 winners. Man of the
match went to Hamish Dickson this
time for his impressive Goalkeep-
ing throughout the match which
saved us on occasion from losing
the tight lead.
The Cup final was held last Sun-
day against Barts and the London.
IC were unstoppable and this match
highlighted the improvement of the
team over the season as we ran
away with a 16-1 win.
The team played some beautiful
lacrosse and also battled hard de-
spite difficult conditions and were
duly rewarded with goals. Man of
the Match went to Chris Allen for
his tally of goals he notched up!
I would just like to thank everyone
who has played in these fixtures, it
has been a real club achievement to
get this cup and represents a lot of
hard work throughout the season.
We can look forward to retaining
the silver next year!
