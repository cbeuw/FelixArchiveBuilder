FROM FELIX 1985
The Phantom Soaker has struck
once more. Three plastic bags
containing water were tipped over
victims as they were seated in the
gents toilets in the Physics
department on Tuesday.
Similar attacks have been occuring
since mid-September and thirty
incidents have been reported to
date.
The 'Phantom' has concentrated
his efforts on the Sherfield building
but has also visited the Physics and
Mechanical Engineering depart-
ment.
A letter, signed by 'The Phantom
Soaker' has been mysteriously
delivered to the FELIX office:
Dear Editor,
In reply to Dr R Benodekars letter
published in the 18th October issue,
the carrier-bag in question was not
full of water as described but only
half full of water. This kind of
misleading information from so
called 'academics' should justly be
rewarded with a soaking and any
other Imperial persons who are
regarded by myself as 'snobby
nosed swots' will be duly showered.
Yours sincerely,
The Phantom Soaker.
'The Phantom has got to be some
kind of nut' said John Boroughs of
Security.
Geoff Reeves, Chief Security
Officer has expressed concern for
the Phantom's health and is
appealing for any relevant
information.

HELP!
We require people to help with the
production of FELIX. The post of
Sports Editor still remains vacant and
anybody interested in becoming part
of this small, friendly team should
come and see Bill Goodwin in the
Office (top left hand corner of Union
Building) at any time.
Recipe
By YISHU NANDA
I have never been treated to such a
display of Spanish gastronomic
wizzardry. Maria Luisa Fernandez
of Chem Eng was in total control as
she demonstrated the art of making
a paella to a keen group of
onlookers—including the FELIX
camera.
The paella, one of Spain's inter-
nationally acclaimed contributions
to the culinary world, originates
from Valencia on the East coast.
Whilst there are many variations on
the ingredients one can use, the
seafood paella must be the most
popular.
Ingredients
1 small cup Uncle Ben's American long
grain rice
Olive oil
1 lemon
1 medium size onion
2 green peppers
4oz cleaned squid
6-8 mussels in the shell
6-8 clams in the shell
6-8 prawns in the shell
6-8 oz chicken with bones
Several cloves of garlic to taste
Fresh parsley
1-2 canned tomatoes
Although a paella is not a difficult
dish to make it requires substantial
preparation of the ingredients.
Preparing the chicken stock
Place the chicken pieces in enough
water to cover them. You might like
to add any odd vegetables you have
lying around to give the stock more
flavour. Boil the chicken until it is
cooked and remove all the chicken
from the bone keeping the meat on
a plate. Throw away the bones and
reserve the stock for cooking the
rice.
Preparing the mussles
Buy many more mussles than you
are going to use because they can
always be frozen pre-cooked. Throw
away any mussles that do not close
when tapped. Wash the live
mussles thoroughly, scrubbing
them with a brush to remove any
grit that might be stuck on them.
Place sufficient water in a pan to
cover the mussles. Bring the water
to the boil, add some salt and the
mussles. Simmer until most of the
mussles have opened. Throw away
any that have not. Keep the mussle
stock in reserve.
The clams can be prepared in the
same way as the mussles. The clam
stock should also be reserved. The
mussles and clams can be prepared
days in advance. Keep them frozen
and refrigerate the stock.
Preparing the prawns
Remove the heads from the tails.
Place in a pan of boiling water.
Simmer until the prawns are
cooked. Throw away heads and
keep the tails. You might like to
keep the prawns whole for asthetic
value. Reserve the prawn stock.
Preparing the squid
Remove the backbone and the
stomach sac. Cut the squid stomach
into rings and the tentacles into 2-3
pieces. Bring a pan with a little
water to the boil and simmer for 15
minutes. It does not matter if the
squid is not tender because it will be
fried and cooked with the rice.
The rest...
After much ardous preparation, the
final act can begin. A good paella
requires a large flat frying surface so
that the layer of ingredients never
becomes too thick. Do whatever you
can—improvise by using two frying
pans if necessary.
Add enough olive oil to cover the
frying surface. Heat the oil. Add the
chopped onion, garlic and green
pepper. Fry until the onions begin
to brown. A d d the chopped
Food
tomatoes and continue frying for a
few minutes. Add the squid and
continue frying. Add the parsley
and rice. Keep things stirred so they
do not stick.
Whilst all the frying is going on
add a little bit of the chicken, prawn,
mussle and clam stock and heat
until boiling.
After the rice has been fried for a
few minutes add two cups of boiling
stock. At this point the rice should
no longer be stirred as this loosens
the starch and the rice becomes
sticky. Do not cover the pan. Cook
on low heat for 25 mins.
Five minutes before the rice is
cooked, arrange the cooked
mussles, clams, prawns and chicken
on the surface of the rice.
After the rice has been cooked
cover it with a lid and let it sit for
five minutes.
Uncle Ben rice is recommended
because it can take substantial abuse
without getting sticky although in
Spain the chefs would not dream of
using it.
As if the paella was not enough, it
was followed by a triple-barelled
dessert.
A chocolate mousse, a Tirami Su
(meaning cheer me up) and a trifle
made this culinary adventure worth
writing home about.
If you are cooking anything
outrageous why not invite FELIX to
capture the event for you. I would
|like to thank Maria Luisa for letting
;FELIX intrude into the privacy of her
kitchen.
