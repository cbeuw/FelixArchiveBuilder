Old Boy Racers
Imperial College has produced
many outstanding engineers,
scientists and industrialists, but
three in particular stand out in the
field of modern motor racing. Their
contributions are in the three basic
areas of the sport: engines, chassis
and leadership.
The most successful Formula One
engine ever is the Ford Cosworth
DFV. Designed and produced in
Northampton, it has powered 155
cars to Grand Prix victories and
spawned winning variants for
Indianapolis and Sportscar racing.
Cosworth Engineering was set up as
a joint venture between Mike Costin
and Keith Duckworth, the latter a
graduate of Mechanical Engineering
at IC. First built in 1967, the 3 litre
engine won its very first race at
Zandvoort, Holland, in the back of
Jim Clark's Lotus 25. Between then
and the takeover of the more
powerful turbo-charged motors it
provided the power for 11 World
Champion drivers. The 3.5 litre DFZ
version is currently being used by
several Grand Prix teams and will
be used by even more next year
when the turbos are banned. In
America, the 2.65 litre turbocharged
DFX version has won over 100
Indycar races, including many
Indianapolis 500s. During his time
at College Keith was Guild's Motor
Club captain and also 'Bo' driver.
A lot of old Formula One DFVs
have found a good home in Formula
3000, which is the category a step
down from Fl. One of the most
successful manufacturers of these
cars is Lola, where IC Mech Eng
graduate Mark Williams is designer.
His cars have won races in each of
the last three years but have been
denied the championship. At 29
years old Mark is one of the
brightest design prospects around,
and rumour has it that he has been
approached by Minardi to design
the Italian team's Formula One cars.
Jaguar have enjoyed fantastic
success recently, both on and off the
track. A lot of the credit for this must
go to the company's Chairman and
Chief Executive, IC graduate Sir
John Egan. Sales of road cars have
increased dramatically and this has
gone hand in hand with sportscar
racing success. Sir John has actively
supported the racing programme,
which culminated this year with the
'Grand Slam' of World Sportscar
Champion Driver, Champion Team
and victory in the Le Mans 24-hour
race.
There are many graduates who
have competed in motor sport. I
have get to find one who was really
famous, although current Guilds
HST Paul Ewing has competed on
the RAC Rally in the past.
Festival Fresher
Chris Goodwin left Imperial College in the summer
to embark on a career as a professional racing driver.
Adrian Bourne went down to meet him at Brands
Hatch during preparations for the most important
meeting of the year.
The DataCartel Formula Ford
Festival and World Cup is
considered by many to be the best
meeting of the year. 200 mainly
young drivers fight it through
qualifying, heats, quarters, semis
and a Final. The action is invariably
frenetic, and there are incidents
aplenty. The prestige of winning is
considerable, and is often the start
of a rapid rise through formula three
into formula one.
Former IC student Chris Goodwin
will be competing for the first time
and although an outright win is an '
unrealistic hope, a good
performance will make the
prospects for next year brighter.
Chris is one of the many drivers to
have started their racing careers in
Formula First, contesting last year's
inaugural championship. Some of
you may remember seeing Chris on
television last year when he was the
subject of a Top Gear documentary
which followed the ups and downs
of the season, including some fairly
spectacular in-car footage on the
way to winning the last race of the
year.
That victory at Brands Hatch was
followed by a six month break
during which Chris concentrated on
Paddock Hill Bend Druids Hairpin Clearways
A lap of Brands
The Brands Hatch 'Indy' circuit is
one of the most challenging courses
in the country. What makes it
different from airfield tracks like
Sfiverstone or Thruxton is the
incredible change in gradient and
camber that the natural bowl in the
Kent countryside provides. Chris
Goodwin describes how he drives
the 1.2 mifes m just over 48 seconds,
"Across the start'finish line you
approach Paddock HOI Bend in 4th
gear pulling about 6,800 rpm (7,000
for a really good lap), which is about
115 mph. Stay in fourth through the
corner after touching the brakes and
scrubbing off a little speed by
throwing the car into the bend. Exit
the corner with about 5,800 rpm {90
mph) Stay in fourth gear up the
hill, braking hard just before the
bridge and changing straight down
into second for the hairpin at
Druids.
"Powering out of Druids as
smoothly and early as possible,
change up to third at the bottom of
the hill just before Graham Hifl
Bend. This corner is taken without
lifting off the accelerator, but only
if on the right line. Stay in third all
along Cooper Straight approaching
Surtees with 7000 rpm on the clock.
Surtees is one of the most
challenging bends and is taken with
the slightest of lifts of the throttle,
Staighten this section as much as
possible by using the kerbs on the
left and right of the track, being
careful not to lose control as the car
is thrown slighltly sideways one
way and then the other.
"Brake hard for Clearways and
change down to second. This corner
is crucial for a fast lap and exit speed
is all important. Accelerate,
changing up to third gear whilst
negotiating the last part of the
corner with one hand. Fourth gear
is taken about one third of the way
along the straight, sticking to the
right hand side next to the pit wall.
This way you follow a slight dip in
the road and also prevent the car
behind edging down the inside into
Paddock (the favourite overtaking
spot at Brands) at the start of lap
two."
studying(!) and finding sponsors.
With the support of local office
supplier Versapak International,
Chris was able to start the 1988
season in July, by which time most
of the leading drivers had competed
in a dozen races already. The car he
will be driving is a Van Diemen
RF88, as raced by most of the
leading runners. Chris does his own
preparation and is helped at races
by his father and a few friends. At
the recent Cellnet Formula Three
Superprix support race Chris
qualified sixth, breaking the 49
second barrier for the first time
before going on to finish fourth in
his heat.
The quality of television coverage
of motor racing has been much
improved this year, mainly due to
the increased use of the on-board
camera and at the Festival the
Grandstand camera will be attached
to the roll bar of Chris's car, giving
several million viewers the chance
to travel around Brands Hatch on Photo: Ben Daniels
his shoulder. Next Saturday, 5th
November will be when the Eestival
is broadcast, so you can all see how
Chris got on, but for anyone
interested in seeing it live then why
not go along. Brands Hatch is on the
A20, about 20 miles south-east of
London. Nearest BR station is
Swanley (half hourly from Victoria)
although the bus service to the track
is very infrequent on Saturdays and
non- existent on Sundays. Taxis are
cheap and readliy available and it is
normally easy to find someone to
share with. Practice and heats are on
Saturday, with the quarters, semis
and final on Sunday. Admission
prices are available from Brands
Hatch on 0474 872331.
So, if Chris isn't going to win then
who is? Formula Ford is an
incredibly close category and there
are at least 20 or so drivers capable
of winning. The favourites are the
seven drivers who have won rounds
of the R A C and Esso senior
championships this season.
Champion in both series is Derek
Higgins, driving the works
Duckhams Van Diemen. Other
winners include Brazilians Jose
Cordova and Niko Palhares,
Portugal's Pedro Chaves and Pedro
Leita de Faria, Italy's Vincenzo
Sospiri and Britain's Richard Dean
in his Swift. Picking a winner out of
that lot, not to mention the hordes
of talented junior and overseas
runners is virtually impossible but
I'll stick with the prediction I made
in Motor Circuit News and go for
the diminutive Pedro Chaves.
As well as the Festival, there are
support races, including a Sports
2000 race in which Chris also hopes
to be driving and a round of the
Minister Pre '85 FF1600
Championship in which there is also
an IC interest. Former Guilds motor
club Captain, Steve Nixon, drives a
Lola T640E which he prepares
himself and has rebuilt extensively
following an accident at Brands last
year.
