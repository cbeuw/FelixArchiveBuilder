IC maintained their 100% record
with an emphatic victory over the
first division champions Guys
Hospital.
The deadlock was broken in the
first ten minutes when Paul
Thompson headed in via the
goalkeeper and the post, who was
sick as a parrot! Nigel Collier added
a second ten minutes later.
Then Byron Wood stepped up a
gear...into neutral, and sneaked in
a quick four to 'steal' the game.
They scored but who cares!!
By the way Tim Fisher and Paul
Olden were also on the pitch.
Pip Peel did nothing during the
game, but it was his 21st birthday
and he was saving himself for the
performance in the bar after the
match.

IC vs Kings
IC 1-2
KQC-0
An unspectacular but hard working
performance by the firsts saw them
notch up a second successive win,
against last season's runners-up,
Kings. Once again IC started
tentatively with sloppy passing
allowing King's to take the initiative,
forcing several saves from Simon
Holden early on. However, IC
regained their composure and took
the lead on the half hour after Paul
Olden was dubiously judged to
have been fouled in the box. Phil
Ewart drove the result penalty
straight at the keeper, who
obligingly dived over the ball.
King's again pulled themselves
together but were stopped in their
tracks by the stupendous goal from
Pip Peel. Beating the entire defence
single-handedly. Our intrepid
midfield man kept his cool and
calmly slotted the ball home.
Kings started the second half in
aggressive style and IC were content
to contain them and work on the
break. This they did well and could,
indeed should have, increased their
lead when Nigel Collier glanced a
header against the bar. Kings
continued to attack, hitting the post
and forcing several corners.
However they lacked initiative in
front of goal and IC's efficient back
four coped admirably. Having
weathered the storm, IC moved up
a gear and finished off a comfortable
win on top.
SKIING
Dry Slope
Racing
In the first race of the year at
Welwyn Garden City on Sunday
the Ski Club entered three complete
teams (is this a record?).
The 1st team survived the first and
second rounds undefeated, despite
some impromptu ballet by Anna,
but then faced a team who looked
as if they lived on a dry slope in the
final.
The 2nd and 3rd teams both lost
their first races (but not by much)
and then won the remaining races
in the two rounds. This led to a
thrilling confrontation of the two
teams in the play-off for 7th and 8th
places overall. Despite various death
threats and sabotage attempts, the
2nd team won to make the final
placings 2nd, 7th and 8th for IC (out
of 15).
M E N S H O C K E Y
Good Work
IC 3rd XI
Harrow Town Swans III
After three successive defeats
(including an 8-0 thrashing at the
hands of Royal Free) the 3rds looked
a glimmer of their true potential on
a pitch looking more like the Grand
Canyon than anything fit for hockey
and without goalkeeper Shaun who
broke his finger in the warm up
before the game.
Good work in the centre of the
pitch by Martin Garer, Mark
Lansdon and John Briggs led to the
first goal being scored after 15
minutes by Steve Burton and 10
minutes later good work in the left
wing produced the second goal-
scored with clinical precision again
by Steve Burton.
Early on in the second half the
opposition managed to save a rather
scrappy goal from one of their large
number of short corners but the
game was effectively won 10
minutes later when the ball was
picked up at the edge of the D by
Steve Burton who hit a fierce drive
past the advancing goalie into the
bottom left hand corner of the net
to complete his hat trick.
T H O U G H T FOR T H E WEEK
To bed or not to bed? Is this a
stupid question or just a
diabolical pun?
The advantages of late nights
do not include 'The Last Resort'
with Jonathan Ross but perhaps
the seasoned bursts of Batman
on Night Network are worthy of
staying up for.
As regards students getting up
in the morning, this seems for
many a non starter although it
may have been aided by 8.30am
lectures. Anyway who wants to
get up early just to see another
drab London morning?
Is this indiscipline in student
sleeping habits (fun though it
can be at times) a symptom of
more serious factors? Is the
zombied state that it induces due
to an obvious lack of sleep
resulting in stress and
inefficency in our woken hours,
an escapism from reality? an
anaesthetic to the pain of
student life? Moreover is it life
that is the pain or, are we afraid
of quietness and spending time
with ourselves and our
innermost thoughts. Is this lax
discipline in our sleeping habits
a result of us desiring to chase
an Utopia outside our current
existence? Conversely, instead
of lack of sleep being an escape
from life is it instead that we
desire not to sleep but to escape
from the nightmare of i t -
dreams such as appearing on
'The Last Resort' with Johathan
Woss or more profoundly
perhaps, a contemporary
equivalent of Pharoh's Cows?
