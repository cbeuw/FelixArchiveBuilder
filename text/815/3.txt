Narrow escape for student
in ceiling collapse
Editorial
Small Ads. Following the
inadvertent publication of an
offensive and sick small ad in last
week's issue, FELIX will no longer
accept ads which are not signed
with a student's name and
department.
The small ad in question was
submitted by a group calling
themselves IC Class War Group. It
contained references to the death of
PC Blakelock who was stabbed to
death in a riot. It was followed this
week by an equally sick, unsigned
letter which advocated, amongst
other things, the firebombing of
petrol stations. The letter has been
consigned to the bin.
I have spoken to the people who
submitted the ad and they assure
me that an apology will be
forthcoming. FELIX has no intention
of printing any other material
submitted by this group.
FELIX editorial policy. Articles will
be accepted for publication provided
they are interesting, attributed, and
not unreasonably offensive. The
Editor cannot guarantee inclusion of
any articles submitted and reserves
the right to edit any articles
submitted.

The Great
Tray Robbery
Trays worth £2.40 each are
disappearing from the Union Snack
Bar. At the start of term there were
one hundred and fifty trays. On
Monday, Union Snack Bar Manager
Dave Peacock, said he could account
for about one hundred. He is now
looking for some means of
controlling where the trays are
going.
A ceiling collapsed in Evelyn
Gardens last Friday. This is the
second time in two years that a
bedroom ceiling in Southwell Hall
has fallen in. The room was
unoccupied at the time. Speaking
on the incident Warden, Ken Young
predicted 'There's a chance
someone's going to get killed'.
The three by four foot slab of %
inch plaster crashed down onto the
sink and coffee table, and a one foot
by two foot chunk hit the bed. There
was dust across the room and many
items required dry cleaning, the
ceiling is now in the process of being
repaired by contractors.
Peter Leeson, Residential
Superintendent at Evelyn Gardens,
could find 'no apparent reason' for
the collapse. He said that there is
'no way of telling' when the eighty
year-old lathe and plaster ceilings
will fall down. "The ceilings sag and
get tired' he claimed, 'but they do
get checked every two years'.
Mr Leeson supported Mr Young's
warnings about the fatal potential of
the ceilings, but added 'I'm willing
to risk it'. He claims that eighty per
Divers
rescued
Two students from Imperial College
Underwater dub were rescued by
helicopter from a diving incident off
Skomer Island, West Wales last
Saturday.
Club Chairman Steve Kilmurray
and Jonathon Cunliffe were rescued
after drifting four or five miles away
from the shore for an hour and a
half. Mr Kilmurrary told FELIX 'If
it had been another half an hour, I'd
have been hypothermic'.
The two divers had aborted their
dive after encountering poor
visibility beneath the water. Upon
surfacing they found they had
drifted over two hundred yards
from their boat and were unable to
signal to it through a five foot swell
on the sea. After attempting to swim
against the strong current they tied
themselves together and waited for
the rescue services to arrive.
The helicopter which picked the
divers up was accompanied by two
inshore lifeboats, a diver rescue
group and a group of small local
craft. The divers were flown straight
to Withybush Hospital,
Maverfordwest, where they were
later discharged.
cent of houses in London have
similar ceilings and that two
occurences in two years is not
frequent enough to cause alarm.
The collapsed ceilings are replaced
by conventional plasterboard ones.
The Hall is not financially capable of
replacing all the ceilings; Southwell
'always overspends' its current
budget for maintenance.
Twenty months ago a ceiling
collapsed onto the feet of a student
who was sleeping the wrong way
round after drinking. No report of
the incident was made at the
Student Residence Committee
(SRC).
Mr Peter Hallworth, Managing
Surveyor of Residences, declared
that there was 'no real danger to
students'. He said that similar
events could occur as a result of, for
example, 'the movement of
students having parties in their
rooms' or 'leaking showers', but did
not see that this warranted a
restructuring of all the ceilings.
