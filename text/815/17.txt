Islam
(continued from page 8)
presented by Islam right in the
current of life. Heads of
governments, goverors of states,
judges, members of armed forces
and police services, elected
representatives of the people in the
parliament, leaders of finance, trade
and industry, college and university
teachers, and students alike receive
guidance to organise their lives
according to the principles of Islam.
There is no distinction in Islam
between private and public conduct.
The same moral code which one
observes at home, applies to one's
conduct in public. Every institution
of soicety and every department of
government must conform to the
laws of Islam. Politics must be based
on truth and justice. Nations should
deal with one another, on the basis
of mutual recognition of rights, and
due discharge of obligations. Even
if there has to be war, those engaged
in it should conduct themselves not
as barbarians but as civilised human
beings. When man decides to
submit to the will of God, and
accepts his law as the supreme law,
and organises his life in accordance
with the revealed moral code, on the
principle of accountability to God,
the quality and character of life
cannot be limited to the precincts of
prayer halls. It must extend itself to
every sphere of his work as a man
of God. This briefly is what Islam
stands for. This is no dream or
Utopia. The Prophet of Islam, and
his companions, developed and
established a complete model of
Islam on this earth for mankind to
follow.
