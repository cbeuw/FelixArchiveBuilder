CLUB
Last weekend the Orienteering Club
packed up their compasses, maps,
'O' shoes and the very essential
wellies and red pens and braved
British Rail to discover the wonders
of the Berkshire countryside.
Having skillfully located registration
the merry band proceeded to the
start. The question in the back of
their mind being; 'If I get lost will
I find the snakes in the out of
bounds area?'.
Nobody (who made it back) found
the snakes, and despite the dull
weather all the newcomers
completed their 4.5km course in
around 90-120 minutes, in a not too
muddy state.
This weekend we're heading
North to Dunstable or for the crazier
members of the Club to the Cheviots
for a mountain marathon.
For further details of Wednesday
evening training or weekend
fixtures, contact Andy Faza Kerley

Women
at IC
On Thursday 3 November,
Margaret Cunningham will be
speaking on 'Women at IC—Past,
Present and Future'. She is well
qualified to do so, having been an
undergraduate here when the
number of women totalled 100, and
she has now risen to the rank of
Senior Tutor of DoC. She is a past
Senior Tutor for Women, and plays
a major role in the organisation of
the ICWISE courses.

12.45pm. All welcome, admission is

K U N G FU CLUB
Wu Shu Kwan
At the Imperial College Kung Fu
Club, we practise a style called Wu
Shu Kwan, or Chinese Boxing. It is
commonly known in the West as
Fighting Kung Fu and aims at
training the body and the mind. It
involves training with and without
weapons. Wu Shu Kwan is
probably the most practical and
formidable martial art in the world.
Wu Shu Kwan can be practised by
men and women, young and old, as
an unsurpassed method of self
defence, as an extremely effective
form of physical training and health
culture and as a remarkably easy
way of achieving confidence and
peace of mind. Wu Shu Kwan
training is a sure way of increasing
one's strength, speed, coordination,
agility, mobility, flexibility and
balance.
Wu Su Kwan maintains a very
high standard of instruction and is
intended for anyone who wishes to
achieve a fuller, happier and
healthier life through proven mental
and physical training principles and
methods. Everyone, man or
woman, young or old, can benefit
from competent instruction. With
each session you will find yourself
fitter and more proficient. As a
general rule the basic skills of self
defence can be learnt in a few
months. However, the longer you
train the better you will become—
the sky's the limit.
Training sessions take place in the
Union Gym every Sunday at
4.30pm, with beginners classes
starting every week. There is also
training every Saturday at the
Southside Gym at 4.30pm and
Grandmaster C K Chang holds a
class on Wednesday evenings at
7.30pm in the Union Gym. For
further information, please contact
Steve Murray (Mech Eng 2) or
Warren Wong (Elec Eng 3), or, even
better, turn up to the Sunday
training session and see for yourself.
ULU K A R A T E
Team Trip
to Japan
This summer Sensei Andrews led a
team of six students (Osama,
Abbosh, Ling, James, Newton and
Taylor) to Japan at the invitation of
the World Champion, Sensei
Yahara, to train, compete and live
alongside some of his students from
two Japanese universities.
We flew out to Japan via
Anchorage with British Airways,
arriving 18 hours later at Narita
SB.
Airport, 65km outside Tokyo. It was
a great honour for us to find that
Sensei Yahara, his business partner
and several of his students had
come to meet us at the Airport. We
were then driven to the Imperial
Hotel, probably the best hotel in
Tokyo. Sensei Yahara had arranged
special financial arrangements, just
one example of the kindness and
consideration he showed us.
We spent two days in Tokyo, at
all times being escorted by the
captains of the two university karate
clubs we were to train with, they
met us each morning, taking us out
into Tokyo for breakfast and then
sight seeing. Sensie Yahara
honoured us by arranging for us to
watch the Instructors training
class—a privilege usually only
bestowed on visiting dignitaries.
That evening Sensei Yahara took us
all out for a Chinese meal with some
of his friends, including two
Frenchmen who were going to the
training camp with us.
The next day we went to the
station to meet the 40 students from
the Japanese Universities with
whom we then continued on to the
karate camp, after two and a half
hours we arrived at the City of
Okahoma and, transferring to two
coaches, continued to wind our way
up into the mountains. We arrived
at a small ski resort called Oze,
where we were to train. In the hotel
we slept on traditional Japanese
beds and ate Japanese food whilst
sitting cross-legged at a table. Karate
training commenced the next day,
a typical-day was as follows:
We rose at 6am, awakened by the
village siren, and were transferred
by coach to the dojo (karate hall), at
6.30 kata (karate set forms) training
was taught at the morning session
from 6.45 until 9.00am. After
training we returned to the hotel for
a traditional breakfast, this generally
consisted of rice, seaweed, cold fish,
black tea and Japanese pickles.
Lunch was at noon and the
afternoon karate session
commenced at 3.00pm and
continued until 5.30pm. Afternoon
sessions consisted of kumite
(fighting techniques) usually ending
with some 'free fighting' or a
competition. On the second day the
University of London's team beat
the Japanese Universities team in
the inter-university competition.
After training we returned for
dinner, again very traditional. In the
evenings, meetings were held
which gave us the opportunity to
ask Sensei Yahara questions, and for
him to explain some of the finer
points of the day's lessons.
At the end of the course we had
made good friends with the
Japanese students and on returning
to Tokyo spent the evening with
them whilst Sensei Andrews had
dinner with Sensei Yahara. The
penultimate day was spent sight
seeing around the extensive
markets, including those stocking a
wide variety of fish.
Although we spent only ten days
in Japan we were able to sample the
culture in a quite unique way. As we
were always accompanied by
Japanese students we had no
serious language problems and
experienced the Japanese way of
life. The karate training was very
hard and the spirit shown by the
Japanese students was frightening
at first. However, with the help of
Sensei Andrews we were able to
overcome this fear quite early on
and train as hard as them with just
as much spirit.
Sensei Yahara impressed us all by
his skill and by the generosity he
showed us, even though we were
only students. We all returned with
new values of respect for other
people and for our instructors. We
hope next year that some of our
Japanese friends will come to
England to visit us, we can then
return their great hospitality and
thank them again for making our
trip so memorable and so full of
experiences.
