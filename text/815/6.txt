The Prophet has to prescribe a moral
code, enunciate the principles of
culture and civilisation, lay down
the mode of worship, establish a
framework of belief, and define the
moral imperatives, which must
govern our life. The Prophet
determines the rules which should
form the basis of social and cultural
relationships, economic, judicial,
and political dealings, matters of
war and peace, and international
affairs. The Prophet does not
transmit merely a code of ritual
commonly regarded as 'religion'.
He brings with him a whole system
They did not succeed
because of the
prejudice and
intolerance of the
people
of thought and action which is called
Al-Deen (a complete way of life) in
Islamic terminology.
The mission of a Prophet does not
end with the announcement of this
way of life to the world at large. He
has to guide the people who follow
him, explaining to them the
implications of the Islamic creed, the
moral code, the divine injunctions
and commandments, and the form
of worship that sustains the whole
system. He has to demonstrate, by
practice, the faith he preaches, and
his life should be a model which
people may be able to follow to
organise their own lives. He must
give training to the individuals and
the muslim society as a whole to
prepare them for practical
particiaption in the evolution of
Islamic culture and civilisation. The
believers must grow under his
guidance into an organised
community engaged in establishing
the Islamic system of life so that
God's word should prevail upon all
other words.
Not all the Prophets completely
succeeded in this mission. There
were many who failed not because
of any personal fault or inadequacy.
They did not succeed because of the
prejudice and intolerance of the
people or because the circumstances
were not favourable. But every
Prophet had the same mission, and
it is a fact of history that Mohammed
succeeded in establishing the
Kingdom of God on earth, as it is
in the heavens.
The audience of the Quran and
Prophet Mohammed was the whole
of mankind form the very outset,
and those who accepted the word
acquired the status of believers
without any distinction. At no time
was the invitation" of the Quran
addressed to the people of any
particular area, race, tribe, colour or
language. The Quran always calls
upon the 'progeny of Adam' or 'the
mankind' to accept Islam. The
specific insturctions and injuctions
. are meant for those who have come
to believe in Islam and they are
always addressed as 'those who
believe'. That the message of Islam
was universal in character is proved
by the fact thatthose who accepted
the message acquired equal rights
and status as believers, regardless
of all differences of origin. The
Quran says, 'the believers are all like
brothers'. The Prophet said: 'those
who subscribe to our beliefs, and
adopt the Islamic way of life, have
the same rights and the same
obligations as we have.' The
Prophet announced, 'Listen! you
have one God as you have one
father (Adam). There is no
distinction between an Arab and a
non-Arab. There is no preference for
No one can claim to
be a law giver on
God's Earth
the black over the fair, or the fair
over the black. There is distinction
only in submission to God. The
most virtuous among you is the
most honourable in the eyes of
God'.
Among the fundamental of Islam
the mot important is belief in one
God not just the conviction that He
exists or that He is one—but that He
alone is the creator, Master, Ruler,
and Administrator of all that exists.
The universe exists because God
wills it to exist, it functions because
God wills it to function, and God
provides the sustenance and the
energy which everything of the
universe requires for its existence
and growth. All the attributes of
Sovereigny reside in God alone, and
no one else has a share in them in
the slightest degree. He alone
possesses any of those attributes.
He views the whole universe, and
all it contains, in a single
instantaneous glance. He has direct
knowledge of the universe and all
that is there in the universe. He
knows not only its present but its its
future, as well. This omnipresence
and omniscience is an attribute of
He has direct
knowledge of the
universe and all that
there is in the
universe
God alone and no other. There was
no 'before' Him and no 'after' Him.
He has been there always and will
be there always-eternal and abiding.
All else is transient. He alone is
eternally living and present. He is
no one's progeny and He has no
progeny. Whatever exists, beside
His self, is His own creation, and no
other can identify himself in any
manner with the Lord of the
Universe, or claim to be his son or
daughter. He is man's single Deity.
To associate anyone in His worship
is a great a sin as it is an act of
infidelity. He responds to man's
prayers and He alone has the power
to accept or reject them. Not to ask
of Him is senseless arrogance, and
to turntoothersis sheer ignorance.
To seek of Him, and also of others,
is to associate equals with Him.
The sovereignty of God in Islam
is not just a supernatural
phenomenon. It covers all aspects
of political and legal sovereignty also
and in these too no one other than
God has any share. In God alone
rests the rightful authority to
exercise power on this earth, and
over those whom God has created
in it. No monarch, no elite class, no
leader of any religious group, no
democracy established on the basis
of the sovereignty of the people, can
participate in God's sovereignty.
Whoever claims such a position is
a rebel, as are those who leave God
and turn to other people in
obedience. Similarly, any institution
or individual attempting to assume
political and legal sovereignty and
restrict the jurisdiction of God to
spheres of personal law or ritual
duties, is really a usurper and a
rebel. The truth is that no one can
claim to be a law-giver on God's
earth, and no one can challenge the
supreme authority of God Almighty
in any sphere. Another
fundamental creed of Islam-
complete submission to God—is
belief in the hereafter (Akhirah).
Denial of the hereafter is the dinial
of Islam even though one may have
belief in God, in the Prophets (peace
be upon them), and the Quran. Man
has not been unleashed on the earth
an irresponsible savage. He is
accountable to God for his actions.
The judgement will rest on one
question: Did man conduct himself,
in submission to God, in strict
conformity with the truth revealed
to the Prophets, and with the
conviction that he will be held
responsible for his conduct in life on
the Day of Judgement? If the answer
is in the affirmative, the reward will
be Paradise, and if in the negative,
Hell will be the punishment. Those
who believe in the hereafter in the
form which Islam represents it, do
not delude themselves that they
have nay special relationship with
God, or that anyone can intercede
on their behalf. They know that they
alone are responsible for their
actions. For them the belief in the
hereafter becomes a great moral
force. A person who has the
conviction tht he is fully accountable
for all his actions finds a permanent
guard, stationed within himself,
who cautions him and admonishes
him whenever he deviates from the
right path. There may be no court
to summon him, no policeman to
apprehend him, no witness to
accuse him, and no public opinion
to press him, but the guard within
him is ever on the alert, ready to
seize him whenever he transgresses.
There can be no greater instrument
of moral reformation nor any better
method to help man to develop a
sound and stable character. It is the
The same moral code
which one observes at
home applies to one's
conduct in public
hereafter which helps man, under
all circumstances, to conform to
God's scheme of permanent values.
A little earlier, I mentioned that
Islam represents a whole
civilisation, a complete culture, and
a comprehensive order. It provides
moral guidance in all walks of life.
That is why Islamic values are not
for the ascetic who renounces the
world, but for him who actively
participates in different spheres of
life, and works within them. The
moral values for which people look
in secluded worship places, are
