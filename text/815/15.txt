YHA Goes to Town
And Country!
The Youth Hostel Club certainly
went to town for its first walk this
year, along the Grand Union Canal
in East London, and ending in
Docklands for the 'Jean Michel Jarre'
concert.
As a complete contrast, the
following two weekends were spent
walking in the Peak District and
Shropshire.
In Shropshire we stayed at
Ludlow Youth Hostel, and walked
the areas known as 'The Long
Mynd' and 'Wenlock Edge'.
In the Peak District, Meerbrook
Youth Hostel was our base, and
walks included the beautiful valley
of 'Dove Dale'.
Youth hostelling and walking are
marvellous ways of exploring Britain
and of making new friends at the
same time. Little is required in terms
of equipment but recommended
are: walking boots, waterproofs and
a good sense of humour (necessary
when crossing the bogs and
marshes).
For further information about our
acitivities, just come along to a
meeting (12.30pm Thursdays in
Southside Upper Lounge) or contact
Brian Dorricott via the Elec Eng
pigeonholes.

We also need drivers for a
playgroup and other activities which
take place throughout the year.

FILMSOC
The Blues
Brothers
What can one say about this film?
A cult movie to rival The Rocky
Horror Picture Show in popularity, it
surely has one of the best
soundtracks of any movie. It's the
story of two lovable rogue brothers,
Jake and Elwood Blues, and their
attempts to resurrect their band to
raise enough money to save their
old orphanage. Starring John
Belushi and Dan Ackroyd, there are
some notable special guest
performances by such musical
luminaries as Aretha Franklin,
James Brown and Ray Charles (also
see if you can spot Pee Wee
Herman). The stunts, the music and
the jokes are reason enough to come
and see this film, besides the fact it
is a required part of any student's
education. So come on, and catch
some culture at Filmsoc, we'll be
projecting in Mech Eng 220 at 7pm
on Thursday 3 November' it's only
£ 1 or 50p if you're a member.
(Membership costs £5 and gets you
into your first film free.) We'll be
showing the films below this term
and who knows if there's enough
interest we may go to the Museum
of the Moving Image on the South
Bank or some similar establishment.

REAL ALE SOCIETY
Our first trip this term was on
Wednesday 19 October when 12 of
us visited Fullers' Griffin Brewery
in Chiswick. Our guide showed us
into the 'Hock Cellar', a huge,
partly-underground vault originally
used as a cask-store but now a
reception room containing many
items of Fuller's brewing equipment
on display and with a bar in the
corner. We were given a brief
description of the brewing process
and the usual 'malt grain tasting'
and hop sniffing' took place. This
is where the raw materials of beer
are passed round for
consumption—an essential ritual on
a brewery visit.
We were also given a brief history
of the company. There has been a
brewery on the site since 1660
though the original John Fuller only
joined the enterprise in 1829.
We left the Hock Cellar and
toured the rest of the brewery.
Unfortunately, much of the older
part of the brewery was not
included on the tour and closed
stainless steel fermenting vessels
and computerised control panels do
not hold the same appeal as the
'traditional equipment' still seen in
many breweries.
We returned to the Hock Cellar for
another brewery trip ritual, the free
beer and sandwiches! We were
joined at this point by the Assistant
Head Brewer who was able to
answer our numerous questions
about the brewing process. The bar
was closed at 5pm and after some
excellent beer we left the brewery
only to pause after 50 yards to visit
the Fox and Hounds and Manson
Arms to try 'Mr Harry', Fullers new
guest beer.
Our next trip will be to Kin and
Barnes in Sussex, details at our next
meeting on November 3 in the
Union Crush Bar featuring
Theakstons Old Peculiar.
IC EXPEDITION
We are hoping to run an expedition
during the three month summer
holidays to the Amazon jungle.
Anyone interested in joining the
expedition should send a note via
the internal mail to either Gideon
Smith, Physics 2 or Margaret
Aderin, Physics 2 as soon as
possible (by Thursday 3 November)
stating your name, age, nationality,
department, status (undergraduate
or postgraduate) and relevant
experience (if any).
This info plus a personal financial
contribution of £400 per party
member is stipulated by the Imperial
College Expedition Board (that's
equivalent to £34 per week—not bad
when you consider you'd be paying
at least that to stay in London and
you wouldn't get to fly half way
round the world!).
