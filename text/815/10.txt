THEATRE
The Tempest
(The Old Vic)
The Tempest is not one of
Shakespeare's more exciting plays.
It is often bogged down with long,
uninspiring conversations, and is
confined to just one set. But, the
fascination many have towards it
comes from the correlation the play
has with colonialism, and its strange
magical aura.
Jonathan Miller's new production
at the Old vie tackles the colonialism
theme head on, and possesses that
certain aura. But, on the whole it is
so complacent that it fails to
impress.
For those unfamiliar with the
story, it goes as follows:
Prospero is the unsurped Duke of
Milan, who has been overthrown by
his brother Antonio and the King of
Naples, Alonso. Prospero and his
daughter, Miranda are marooned on
a tropical island, the only other
inhabitants of which are the savage
Caliban and a spirit, Ariel whom
Prospero enslaves with a powerful
spell.
A violent storm bring Prospero's
enemies to his island, and so, using
his magic he prepares to exact his
revenge upon them.
What follows is a study in such
traits as love and loyalty, as Miranda
falls in love with Ferdinand, the son
of Alonso; of repression and
tyranny, with Caliban and Ariel
yearning for freedom from
Prospero; and of submission and
ambivalence, when Prospero
decides he cannot carry out his
intentions, but has to make his
peace with Alonso, for the sake of
Miranda.
There is also a sprinkling of
humour, in the form of other
shipwrecked characters.
The star cast includes Max Von
Sydow as Prospero, the cornerstone
of the play, and Alexei Sayle in the
comic role of Trincula.
Although an impressive and
powerful presence, Von Sydow
seems somewhat uneasy with the
text. He seems to worry so much
about the words that he fails to
project the character. On a number
of occasions he seemed to stop the
performance with an arresting jolt,
rather than keep it moving smoothly.
Alexei Sayle is a lot more
successful as a loud-mouthed
thug—a part tailormade for him. He
is there to provide some badly
needed levity to the play, and
achieves it in his typical over-the-top
way.
The acting on the whole, is of a
very high quality. Especially good
is newcomer Rudi Davies as the
naive and warf-like Miranda.
However, one comes away from
a play like this feeling unsatisfied.
The play lacks any suspense or
tension, but whether this is due to
the text or the production, I'm not
sure. Still, the director could have
made his point with a lot more
conviction. It was as if we were
supposed to think, there is a star
cast, a famous director, a renowned
theatre, so it's bound to be good.
But it stops there, and the
production doesn't prove how good
it is. Indeed, the set, which can be
described as 'Channel Four-esque'
detracts much of the attention. It
consists of two rather odd, large
slanting cubes, in the midst of a
breen desert scenery.
The Tempest may hold some
intellectual interest, but as a drama
it is rather insipid.
Student standbys are available at
£6.

FILM
Distant Voices,
Still Lives
It is rare that a film, which follows
no tangible plot, and which is
occupied by everyday, normal
people, doing everyday normal
things, can be described as totally
engrossing, but Terrence Davies'
Distant Voices, Still Lives is just that.
This detailed essay on life in the
North during the forties and fifties
is divided succinctly into two halves
(called Distant Voices and Still Lives
respectively). But it is there that the
natural order of the plot ends, as the
film consists of a series of recollected
scenes from the various characters'
lives, as if the cast's collective
conscious was reminiscing about
their lives. (The random sequence
of the scenes intensifies the feeling
of recollection—who reminisces
chronologically?)

BOOK
A Land in
Flames
David Marcus, Corgi, £3.99
Take a widow (ahh), her two frisky
daughters (ooh-er), an evil estate
manager (boo-hiss) and an
embittered peasantry (hurrah). Set
them in Ireland in the early 1920s
and light the blue touch paper.
The story, written one suspects
with half an eye on a television mini-
series, is the familiar plot of the
thousand British B movies. The once
great Odron estate is in decline and
the ambitious estate manager wants
to own it all (don't they always in
these books?), with enough love
interest thrown in to keep the
boredom levels down.
The novelty I suppose is the Irish
setting, however, the characters are
unsympathetically drawn and only
Halloran, the Sinn Fein leader,
speaks passionately for Ireland. The
other characters are walking
Cliches, the kind hearted Dixon type
Policeman, the studious socialist
and the quiet, ineffectual shitor. All
good stuff, but essentially vacuous.
The writing is literate but verbose.
For example growing a few flowers
translates to 'coaxing a meagre
quorum of lupins'.
The ending is remarkably
predictable, and tidy, with enough
room for a sequel. If a long train
journey beckons I suppose you
could do worse, but not much.
Oh, one last thing, the wild gypsy
is on page 208.
Mike Bell.
The first half opens with the
funeral of a man (Peter
Postlethwaite), and continues with
his family's various collections of
their relationship with him. The
memories are a mixture of some
idylic childhood scenes, which are
dominated more by scenes of the
father's severity and harshness,
which has been cultivated by a
Catholic upbringing and extreme
poverty. Glimpses of his tenderness
are revealed, but his rigidity and
inability to live is matched only by
his wife's immense capacity for
forgiveness and love.
These scenes, along with the
scenes the children's inevitable
rebellion against their father's
regime, are intercut with weddings,
funerals and outings to the pub,
(again reinforcing the theme of
reminiscence).
The second half continues the
lives of the family and their friends,
and turns its attentions to the
suffering women under men's
ignorance and insensitivity, which
is instilled through their
advantageous position in society. It
concentrates on the three children;
Eileen, Tony and Maisie, who are
very close (the deeper the cut, the
closer the binds?).
Basically, Davies' film is about
how people survive the drudgery of
their own lives. Through the
excellent script (which is also
Davies') which is devoid of
pretentiousness and carrion
dialogue, and the superb ensemble
playing of the cast, the film breathes
life into time-worn themes, such as
human dignity surfacing in the
harshest of circumstances, and how
we deal with our problems by
avoiding them, rather than
confronting them. It's illustrated
how mass media pills, such as
songs, radio and cinema merely
gloss over everyday pains, rather
than curing them.
The background details, such as
the dirty brown colours which
prevade every scene, the songs
which are intrinsically interweaved
with the general flow rather than
standing out like obvious set pieces,
and even the weather conditions all
serve to compliment the feeling of
the film, which, although it deals
mainly with pain and the mundane,
is an uplifting experience.
The stillness and slow sweeps of
the camera let's the eye observe in
great detail and it is a film which
demands to be observed. It is
Coronation Street with class and
clarity. It is a rare film.
