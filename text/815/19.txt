Magnetic
doors
Residents of Southside and Evelyn
Gardens have started using a
magnetic key system designed to
make the Halls more secure. The
keys, which resemble dog-tags can
be recoded each year for new
students, said College Chief
Security Officer, Geoff Reeves. They
will also be fitted to all student
bedrooms at a cost of £150 each.
Previous problems with security
have been worsened by the loss of
keys in the Summer Letting
Scheme.
Linstead Hall retains an ASSA
twin system with a key blank
unique to the College.
Computer
thefts
Thieves stole £14,000 worth of
computer hardware from a research
block in Mechanical Engineering on
Monday night. The theft is the latest
in a spate over the summer and the
work of a professional gang who
specialise in stealing desk-top
computer hardware said the College
Security Office, Geoff Reeves. He
also believes the gang has a mole
working in the College providing
keys and inside knowledge essential
to the crimes.
The Rector, Eric Ash, and retiring
Chairman of the Governing Body,
Sir Henry Fisher, condemned cut
backs in University funding at
yesterday's Commemoration Day
Ceremony for new graduates.
The Rector said that the greatest
threat to academic Freedom was not
from the Education Reform Bill but
from reduced finances. He
explained that it was becoming
increasingly difficult to keep
Imperial solvent and expressed
concern that lack of resources would
lead to the loss of aceademic talent
within Universities.
The Rector went on to say that
universities were becoming
increasingly privatised, with
Imperial now gaining 46% of its
funds from sources outside
Government.
In a speech given towards the end
of the ceremony, Sir Henry Fisher
said that Imperial had been
managinging to maintain its
standard of research and teaching,
but added that 'those in
Government do no always realise
the effect of cut backs in human
terms.'
During the ceremony, Professors
Ian Butterworth, Sir Peter Hirsch
and Sir Stanley Peart, Soichiro
Honda, Mostafa Kamal Tolba and
Sir Frank Cooper incoming
chairman of the Governing Body,
were welcomed as Fellows of IC by
College Secretary John Simth in a
series of comic speches. An
Honorary Associate was also
presented to Michael Humphrey
Robert Sandwith.
Blurred
vision?
The Student Televison of Imperial
College (STOIC), held an interview
with Kenneth Baker MP on
Wednesday as he left IC after a visit
to the College. Newshound Jason
Lander spoke to Mr Baker on issues
of Higher Education.
After their exclusive 'scoop' the
team rushed the video tape to
London's LTV stuios for coverage on
their programme 'London Plus'.
Unfortunately, the video film was
out of focus. 'Well wortl) £2,344 of
anybody's money' said Station
Manager John Denham afterwards. -
Raw deal for
foreign
students
Overseas student families with
young children are in danger of
losing their accomodation at
Silwood. This follows a College
decision last June to raise rents from
£32 to £49 per week, exclusive of
bills, which the Union at Silwood
fought and won. They succeeded in
keeping the rent down to £42.
The families live off a British
Council grant of £360 per month,
which fluctuates according to the
dollar. With bills at £220 or more per
month now, families are finding it
difficult to cope according to
Silwood Union President, Ian
Lowles.
The students' spouses cannot
supplement their income, as they
are unable to obtain a work permit
in Britain. Martin Parsons,
administrator of Silwood, has met
with John Smith, the College
Secretary on a Housing Committee.
'Everything that we predicted has
come true', added Mr Lowles,
'overseas families cannot afford to
live— we forcasted this as early as
June.'
And finally
Last Tuesday's Imperial College
Union General Meeting saw an
amazing similiarity between the
new IC Union card and Barclays
connect card.
Members and non-members of
the Union were seen voting with
Barclays Connect cards and being
counted by Imperial College Union
Deputy President Chas Brereton.
Mr Brereton said afterwards "That's
the way it goes I suppose'.
7 think people should be told. '—Andy
