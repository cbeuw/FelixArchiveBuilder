So, if we want a machine to solve
problems it must be able to do
algebra, which is the definition of a
computer. Unfortunately most
computers use numerical methods
of solution, and as Harry points out
'L can always arrange that the
answer you get from a computer is
wrong.' It's rather like Hitch Hikers
Guide to the Galaxy; the computer
will provide a numerical answer, but
there is no guarantee that it is the
correct one for the problem. For
example:
If x=l/Pfori = 1, 2...P
p
then the sum £ x i = 1 is fairly
obvious, but because of random
rounding off errors a computer will
not give this answer. As a result
new developments in computing,
such as PROLOG and artificial
intelligence, are using symbolic
solution.

creation—it all sounds just a little
incredible. Yet Harry Fairbrother
has that unnerving air that suggests
he might just know something that:
you don't. Decanting some
strawberry milkshake into a QT
polystyrene cup, he starts to explain
the intricacies of his theory.
'What I'm trying to do is give the
way of solving a problem a
structure, so that you eliminate trial
and error.'
The technique itself came from
looking at the 'totality of
everything', in particular
knowledge, which Harry considers
to have accumulated from solving
problems. This led him into
studying the structure of problem
solution, looking for a consistent
pattern, and from this he was able
to develop his theory.
The first step is that all problems
in nature can be expressed as:
P(Y) = G
where:
P is the problem
Y a set of things looking for
activities
G is the goal.
Once the problem has
formulised in this way it is then
transformed and a decision made,

Total Area = (a + b)2

= c2

The decision is then to set;
Problem has goal of proving that the (a + b)2

squares of the other two sides.
The problem is then transformed Hence solution;
thus: a2
