IN THE
PIPELINE

Some health stories gleaned from
the press over the last few months;
believe as much or as little as you
like.
Eating Muesli 'may make
you high'
Some breakfast cereals may contain
active amounts of the hallucinogenic
drug, LSD, according to the British
Nutrition Foundation.
LSD is produced from ergot
which is a fungal infestation of
wheat and rye, and particularly
affects bran, with the consequence
that the current fashion for
wholemeal cereals could result in
the consumption of enough LSD to
cause a lift in mood.
There has been a suggestion that
some of the cereals available in
health food shops carry quite
substantial fungal contamination;
this may explain why muesli has
become so popular. It is probably
not the chocolate on Hob-Nobs
which makes you eat a whole packet
at once.
Morning tea may cut vitamin
benefit
Along with your bowl of bran flakes
you will probably be drinking a cup
of tea. This, according to the
Institute of Food Research, could
reduce the benefits of health
supplements such as iron tablets.
Tea, particularly black tea,
contains free tannin which prevents
the intestine from absorbing iron.
There is also evidence that high fibre
foods can render mineral
supplements almost useless. So
your breakfast cereal may contain
fourteen different vitamins, iron,
selenium and molybdenum, but
these are not of any use to you if
they are not absorbed.
Iron is generally poorly absorbed
from food anyway, unless you take
vitamin C, or drink orange juice;
ideally orange juice should be drunk
with bacon and eggs. Normally the
iron in the egg is virtually not
absorbed at all because of interfering
substances; the orange juice greatly
increases its absorption. That is if
you are more concerned about
Derek Dash stared into the cup of
tea before him. He was a worried
man. Phallix had finally found out
about his plans to change
Cheapskate into Evencheaper-skate.
Somehow they seemed to know
even more about Royal Holloway
than he did.
He'd had to tell them that there
were plans to form a committee
which would decide whether or not
to hold a meeting to consider
whether there should be a working
party on proposals to go to a liaison
group. He didn't know what it all
meant, but Mad Dash had told him
that it was the ideal answer.
After what Willhebe Good-
foracolumninch, the Phallix Editor,
had written about him in Phallix he
wanted Willhebe's tender crinkly
bits over a red hot griddle. He
smiled at the thought and decided
that it wou!d teach him not to nod
when he was told to.
Meanwhile, Little Lord Patacake,
the Chief Citizen, was running
around the citizen's office trying to
look business-like and managerial
behind his office door. As he placed
the last pencil in the neat stack on
his desk he pressed the button on
eating iron than about your heart.
Advice from nutritionalists should
be taken with a large pinch of salt
(now that's another story in itself!).
Illness risk for the inactive
We all know that exercise is good for
us; a recent Government report
warns that large numbers of
children are taking too little exercise
with the consequence that many of
them are likely to be at risk from
serious disease and reduced life
expectancy.
Physical activity is increasingly
being replaced by a sedentary
lifestyle at home (television), going
to school (travelling by car instead
of walking or cycling) and even at
school. So get on your bike and stop
complaining about tube fares.
Risk from radioactive gas
Twice as many homes are exposed
to excessive amounts of radioactive
radon gas as was previously
thought. Radon gas, which is
produced naturally by rocks such as
granite decays into solid isotopes of
polonium and bismuth, which
irradiates the lining of the lungs
with alpha particles which can
induce cancer. The National
Radiological Protection Board
estimates that 1,500 people a year
die from radon-induced lung cancer,
out of a total of 40,000 lung cancer
deaths, which makes this a far more
serious problem than any man-
made radioactive hazard. Un to
the intercom:
'Receptionist, you may let the
citizens into my office now' he said;
somehow, he seemed to have
forgotten Kathy Why-aye-man's
name recently. She smiled at the
citizen in the front of her desk and
let him in.
As he leaned back in his throne
and looked at the citizen, Little Lord
Patacake grinned and asked
'What's your problem little
citizen?'
'Please Mr Patacake, sir. I can't
afford to live in Nibble Hall. The
rent's too high and I'm starving on
the portions in the citizen's Hack
Bar.'
'It's got nothing to do with me,
you worthless piece of cow dung'
said Lord Pattacake.'Go and see
Chas Pianoplayer.'(Lord Pattacake
had discovered that he could solve
all of his problems in this way.)
The citizen cried and Chas
Pianoplayer came in and took him
away.
'Here little citizen,' he said 'have
one of my lovely blue citizens' cards
instead.' He was really proud of his
new cards, even though they were
the wrong size for the plasticy bits
50,000 houses may be exposed to
amounts greater than the action
limit of 400 becquerels per cubic
metre of aid; these houses are
located in granite areas particularly
in Devon and Cornwall.
Blood clots in cramped
air seats
Before you decide to spend your
next summer holiday in Benidorm
rather than Torquay, here's another
problem. It is the increased risk of
developing blood clots due to
cramped conditions on economy
class air flights. A three year study
carried out at Heathrow airport
found that 18 per cent of 61 sudden
deaths in long-distance passengers
were due to pulmonary embolus
(blood clot in the lung). The main
cause is stasis (stoppage of blood
flow) of the lower limb, exacerbated
by cramped conditions, and
dehydration due to excesive alcohol
intake. Journeys as short as three to
four hours may be potentially
dangerous; the formation of a blood
clot may not be noticed until it is
dislodged by vigorous exercise after
the flight. British Airways claim that
the risks are 'infinitely small' in
relation to the number of passengers
carried; however, they recommend
frequent movement in the aisle
during the flight and stop-overs.
This could be achieved easily by
British Rail's method of selling more
tickets than there are seats.

around them.
Back in his office, Derek Dash,
was talking to one of his spies.
'What do you mean, leaving?' he
said.
The little man was whimpering as
Mad Dash tightened the
thumbscrews.
'It's true, I admit it, John
Secretary, Rob McNorthey and PC
Plod, they're all leaving,' he
screamed, 'and soon!'.
The Baron frowned and
pondered. Mad Dash would have
no work on the typewriter if they all
left, and things were getting bad as
it was...
Will John Secretary and his chums
leave?
Will Mad Dash tighten the
thumbscrews further?
Will little Lord Patacake become an
heir apparent by next time?
Is Chas Pianoplayers citizen card
really that good?
The 'Baron of Cheapskate' is a fictional story.
Any similarity between the characters contained
therein and Nigel Baker, Chas Brereton, Rob
Northey, Bill Goodwin, Eric Ash, Clare Ash,
Kathy Tait, Geoff Reeves and John Smith is
entirely coincidental.
