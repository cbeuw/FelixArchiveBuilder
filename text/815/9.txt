Hanna's War Big
(Cert 15)
Hanna's War is the story of the
wartime sufferings of a heroic young
Jewish girl. It is a true story—so
empassioned that it will surely put
the name of Hanna Senesh on the
lips of the world, as Anne Frank's is.
Hanna has grown up in a cultured
and priveleged Hungarian
environment. In the late 1930's,
with the advent of Hitler, the rise of
anti-semitism and Hanna's
emerging recognition of herself as
a jew, she foregoes a career in
writing to study at an agricultural
college in Palestine. She is
eventually asked to join a team of
volunteers, all from various
German-occupied European
countries, to be trained by the
British as a commando and spy.
Thinking she has found a way back
to Budapest to help the 800,000 jews
in refuge there, and also to see her
mother, she signs on. The team of
six are drilled by Squadron Leader
McCormack (Anthony Andrews)—
an arrogant Scotsman with an anti-
female bias.
When Hanna and a companion
attempt to cross into Hungary they
find themselves surrounded by
German soldiers with no escape.
Her partner commits suicide and
Hanna is arrested. The subsequent
physical and psychological torture
which she undergoes at the hands
of the Hungarian state eventually
makes Hanna crack. She is
remarkable in her refusal to give up
the resistance 'code'—but reveals
her true name.
^ With super-human courage
Hanna survives her sadistic
treatment, and when she eventually
has to stand trial as a traitor she
delivers a passionate speech that
stirs the concience of the judges.
When the time comes for her
sentencing, the judges decide to flee
rather than seal her fate, but to no
avail. Her Hungarian torturer, out
of his own perverse sense of justice
institutes his own punishment-
death by firing squad. Hanna, not
yet twenty-four, is executed.
On the surface of it, Hanna is a
woman who set out to do
something and, quite frankly,
failed—clearly not obvious film
material. But this film reveals a new
insight into the Second World
War—the unwavering deter-
mination and steel-strong spirit a
naive individual is capable of
displaying. It is a declaration of
freedom for jews, a total non-
acceptance of the sting of anti-
semitism. You cannot watch this
film and be unmoved.
Cert PG.
We have been blessed with the
release of a spate of extremely well
made and very entertaining
comedies in the last couple of
weeks—Midnight Run, A Fish Called
Wanda, and now Big.
Big stars Tom Hanks (Splash,
Dragnet) as Josh Baskin, a twelve
year-old boy who has been
transformed into a 35 year-old man
by a carnival wishing machine. He
wishes to be 'big' in order to woo
class beauty Cynthia Benson, but
when the wish is mysteriously
granted he finds himself suddenly
thrust into an adult world, for which
he is utterly unprepared. His
mother thinks the big Josh has
kidnapped the small Josh, and his
best friend Billy is the only one who
can help him out.
Together they go off to New York
to find the wishing machine, and in
the meantime Josh gets a job with
a toy company. He quickly moves
up to vice president, when the boss
(Robert Loggia) realises how good
Josh is at tuning in to what kids
want. With success comes a
romance with Susan (Elizabeth
Perkins) but also the emnity of a
Tom Hanks makes it Big
THEATRE
Dead Dad
Dog
Royal Cou
Royal Court, Sloane Square
A two-man show about an
'unemployed yuppie'?...whose
father, twelve years in the grave,
pops down from heaven for a day,
linked to his son by an invisible
umbilical cord which promotes
acute apendicitis if the two stray too
far apart. Which means that the not
over-welcome father has to follow
his son around to job interviews,
and to a first date with a girl he's
been persuing for months.
What can I expect?
Well Dead Dad Dog, despite its
rather cumbersome title, protrays all
these improbable events, and many
more, with astonishing panache, the
like of which this little reviewer has
rarely seen. This play sparkles with
wit, gusto and style. I went in
grouchy, thinking about a problem
sheet, and came out grinning from
ear to ear.
Dead Dad Dog follows Eck and his
dad around Edinburgh, watching
them bicker and squabble and
reminisce, and throw out
observations, almost unnoticed, on
the change of the fabric of life in this
country over the last decade.
It is extremely difficult to write
about the North/South divide
without becoming either bitter or
blase; to consider the change in
attitudes and expectations of
successive generations without
nostaligia or cliched satire. To mix
bitter, upwardly-mobile executive
(John Heard).
Buffetted by new found
responsibilities and a much more
complex emotional life than he ever
imagined, Josh begins to change.
But before long Josh finds the
machine and has to decide whether
to stay as the successful 35-year-old
businessman, or return to his lost
youth and family.
Tom Hanks has always had a
childish exuberance about him, and
so is perfect as Josh Baskin. His
performance accurately captures the
naivety, energy and innocence of
youth and elevates the
characterisation to a different
level—that of total believability. This
is a remarkable performance that
has already propelled him to
superstardom in the States.
The humour comes with a steady
stream of brilliant comic set pieces,
such as the toy shop scene in which
Hanks, without an inkling of
inhibition, experiments with the
toys; and a cocktail party scene, in
which he turns up in a white
sequined tuxedo, and delights us
with his eating habits. But there are
also touching moments like when
we feel for a lonely, forlorn Josh in
a seedy New York motel room. Both
facets to the character are developed
well.
An impressive production
ensemble includes director Penny
Marshal, a former comedy actress,
producer James L Brooks, who gave
us Broadcast News, and Robert
Greenhut, who produced most of
Woody Allen's films. The film will
leave you with a warm feeling inside
and I can guarantee that you'll be
humming 'Chopsticks' as you leave
the theatre.

in humour is hard to even
contemplate. Dead Dad Dog not only
manages all this, it triumphs in it,
dancing over the tightrope of
difficult issues with pure sparkling
joy.
The play is well written,
beautifully acted, by a duo with a
rare feel for split second comic
timing, and originally translated to
the stage. Never cliched, never dull;
contemporary to its gritted teeth,
but timeless also in humour and
touchingly detailed observation.
Dead Dad Dog neither drags its
feet, nor tries to fly way over its
(delighted) audience's head, but
runs joyfully along. Go and see it.. .1
may well see you there.
