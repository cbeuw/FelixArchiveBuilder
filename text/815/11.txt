Short, Sharp,
Shocked
Michelle Shocked
Recently there seems to have been
a spate of talented, female singer-
songwriters (Suzanne Vega, Tracy
Chapman and Michelle Shocked,
being three). Michelle's first album,
Texas—Camp Fire Tapes was released
early last year and was a live, solo
album recorded with a Walkman at
a Texas folk and country festival.
(Honest, you can hear the crickets
chirping in the background.)
Despite the rough production, the
songs shine through with energy,
wit and feeling. Ms Shocked is
clearly a talented songwriter.
Short, Sharp, Shocked is a departure
from the first album in two areas.
One, it is produced to a very high
standard and two, Michelle plays
with a backing band (ranging from
electric guitars to harmonica). What
hasn't changed is the excellence of
the songs. Quite a few of the songs
seem to be written from personal
experience as a youngster in East
Texas. Making the Run to Gladewater
tells the story of a trip out of a 'dry'
county to buy alcohol; V.F.D. tells
the story of an accidental fire set off
by a dangerous prank ("The fields
were black, the sky was grey...'n'
you know them barns they used to
store hay in?'). Many of the songs
have a very bluesy beat to them; If
Love was a Train and When I Grow Up
are pure blues. The L&N Don't Stop
Here No More is a ballad commenting
on the decline of the mining
industry whilst Graffiti Limbo is a
protest song over the miscarriage of
justice.
If you like to hear talented
musicians, down to earth lyrics and
songs which take you places, then
I would buy this album. Short,
Sharp, Shocked; Texas Campfire Tapes
and Disoriented (a 12" single) can be
found on the Cooking Vinyl record
label. A single called Anchorage has
been released and is taken from the
Short, Sharp, Shocked album.

LIVE
The Wedding
Present
Town & Country Club
I arrived at the Town and Country
shortly before the second support
group came on, at least that's who
I think they were.
It was odd, everyone was chatting
quietly amongst themselves, then
suddenly, unannounced, there
were some people on stage. They
didn't introduce themselves, they
just started playing some wishy-
washy songs which sounded like
Everything but the Girl with
something missing (the girl
presumably). The crowd started
bullying them but the band-with-no-
name put on a brave face and
trickled through the rest of their set.
I felt sorry for them when the crowd
cheered them off, but sympathy
isn't something a group should
arouse in you. Who was that
masked man?
Sometimes, when you write these
reviews, you can get tired of
thinking of appropriate metaphors
and 'clever' things to say. You run
out of cliched adjectives and you
just want to tell it straight, so here
it is.
The Wedding Present are bloody
marvellous, a 'bit cuddly' and
violently motivating. I have not seen
a bigger crowd reaction, it was more
furious than the Pogues, Motorhead
and SLF put together with still a
little room for the Damned.
It must be Dave Gedges 'cute'
smile and full Yorkshire accent that
incites the audience and fills you
with adrenalin. The songs thrash
out one after another, thoughtful
lyrics agitating the crowd into a
frenzy.
Good music, good songs, good
atmosphere, good guys. Shit hot-
go and see them.

The Stars of Heaven
The Big Dish

'.. here on the John Peel wing-ding
we throw our hats in the air to the
Stars ofHeaven'. So said He when his
band did a session for the Peel
show. My feeling is that it must
have been a slightly different Stars
ofHeaven that night. The sound was
just not quite right somehow, they
sounded scratchy and unrehearsed.
Only songs like Widows Walk could
rise above this to give us a glimpse
of the true sparkle of the stars.
The Big Dish know exactly what's
going on, they now have 20-20
vision. I say 'now' because when I
saw them play in Glasgow two
years ago they were jumpy and
amateur and seemed destined for
'also-ran' dom. Tonight they were
excellent.
The first thing I noticed was the
sound quality; record perfect. It is
obvious that the group are much
more confident now, this comes
through in their playing and stage
manner. This 'fine sound' is a trait
of many of the newer Glasgow
bands like Hue and Cry, Love and
Money or Deacon Blue, like them or
not they sound polished.
The band also looked good, which
is not always important but is so
completely to their sort of image,
The aesthetics well taken care of,
I could concentrate on the songs.
Most were from the Swimmer and all
were excellent. They have a very
distinctive sound epitomised by
songs such as Prospect Street with its
clear melody and sharp notes,
nothing smudged.
The lead guitarist (who looks like
Michael Elphic—Boon) has a
disturbing rock n roll habit of raising
his left knee and straining his face
whenever he plays a power chord.
This looks out of place next to the
subdued, modest bassist and the
confident, understated James Leslie.
They can't miss.
It is rare for a support band to merit
anything more than a passing
mention but so entertaining were
Brendan Croker and his merry cohorts
that they deserve a full review.
Croker, judging by his accent is from
somewhere up North but when he
sings he sounds reminiscent of Bob
Marley which is iedal for the light
reggae influenced music they play.
It is not pop, and I fear they will
never attain the dizzy heights or
superstardom because of this but
the reworked covers of songs going
back to the twenties were delightful
and had the attention of the
audience throughout; unusual for a
supporting act.
The voice was less effective on
some of the boogie numbers but the
5 O'Clock Shadows more than made
up for it with their skillful playing,
showcasing their talents without
showing off. If you ever fancy a
good night out this group are
warmly recommended should they
be playing at a pub venue near you.

Flesh 4
Lulu
Marquee
It's been a long time since Flesh have
toured. Whether this is good or not
is debatable. I think they have
finally shrugged off their goth image
and following for a much more
mundane audience. Gone are the
flowing black capes and white faces
smothered in eye liner and replacing
them—short hair and 501s.
Flesh only did a few old songs, but
as they haven't played for a year it's
not surprising. The 'oldies' they did
were all of the fast and furious type
from the three LPs, probably to keep
the devoted happy. All the new
songs were slower and involved
jangly or acoustic guitars from Rocco
sporting a cleaner hair style.
Even though the Flesh boys have
been together for five years now
they still haven't achieved the
notoriety achieved by some other
indi-bands, for example The Cult.
Even their so called break of doing
the title track to Some Kind of
Wonderful (called I Go Crazy) has not
catapulted them to stardom, yet.
Maybe the change in style will.
Check out the single I Go Crazy or
see them live on October 28 at the
Savoy (Tuffnel Park) and decide if
/ou agree with the title of the LP.
'.ong live the new Flesh.
