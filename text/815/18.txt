Union
'Gnoming and
Grim-Reapery'
Tonight is the last of our dinners.
The Life Science, Physics and Maths
dinner is followed by a party in the
Main Dining Hall in Sherfield. The
party is also open to Chemists who
went to their dinner on Wednesday.
There is a bar extension until 2am
so it should be good.
The Spanner and Bolt handover
is going well.
Guilds had trouble last Friday
when the police moved them along
whilst they were carol singing. They
also had trouble finding their clue
which was hidden somewhere
unpleasant! Tonight they will
receive their next clue somewhere
near the Serpentine. The total
money handed over so far is about
£500.
Ents are still looking for more acts
for the Smoking Concert in Rag
Week. Call into the RCSU Office or
contact Dave Green in Chemistry 2
if you are interested.
Rag is busy preparing for Rag
Week. Our new idea for this year is
Gnoming and Grim-reapery. You
pay us some money and a Grome
or Grim-reaper follows your victim
around for the day. Sounds like
fun? Then call in the Office and
volunteer or give us a victim.
Dave Williams, RCSU VP.

ICU and St Mary's
After the problems last year
between St Mary's Hospital Medical
School Students Union and ICU we
have now set about discussions
which should result in a merger
going ahead by August 1 1989. A
working party has been set up
consisting of four St Mary's reps
and ICU Exec less Ian Morris. (A
wise move - Ed). We have met twice
over the last month and have made
real progress. The subjects we have
discussed and come to agreement
over include; Academic Affairs,
Welfare, • Accommodation and
Sports Facilities. No insurmountable
problems have been encountered so
far, although we have yet to discuss
the thorny topics of Finance and
Union Policy. Even so, we are so
confident of eventual success that
we have started planning a massive
celebration in the Union Building for
the last Friday of next term. See you
there!
Welfare Survey
By the time you read this most of
you will have received a survey
paper. The remainder will be going
out on Monday. Please fill in these
forms and return them to your
departmental messengers since this
is one of the few chances we get to
see what the real needs of our
student are.

May I apologise to anyone who was
expecting a competent, professional
duo at the Country & Western night
last Saturday. Unable to find anyone
for less than £100, the onus fell on
myself to rope in a friend and rattle
out a small set in five hours whilst
completely blathered.
Many thanks to Jeremy and Jelly
for the help.
On Monday there is a Halloween
Party jointly run by the American
Institute for Foreign Study and
ourselves and tickets are available
from the Union Office for £1.
Elections. Hopefully the election
on Tuesday will have occurred
without too many problems
although I found myself rather lost
using election instructions which
were last updated in 1973.
In the Easter holidays I intend to
review the whole of the Union's
bye-laws which are in a terrible
state) thus making my successors
job more managable.
Posters. John Smith, the College
Secretary has issued a memo
regulating posters to notice board
areas only. I am not entirely happy
with this and hope to have a
meeting with a view to establishing
a compromise.
Ian Morris, ICU Hon Sec (Events)
Sports
shop
shock
Over the Summer the Sports Shop
moved from the Sherfield walkway
to the Union Building. During the
move a complete stock take was
completed which showed that the
Sports Shop was holding a lot of out
of date stock.
In the last few weeks the Sports
Shop has had problems with staff
illness resulting in the shop not
being open.
In order to try and resolve both of
the above problems and to bring a
lot of bargains to you there will be
a Stock Clearance Sale in the JCR
on Wednesday 2 November and
Thursday 3 Novemberfrom10am to
4pm. Depending on the success of
this sale there may be more sales in
the near future.
Warning: Some clubs in the past
have ordered stock to be sold
through the Sports Shop to their
members. This stock is moving very
slowly at present, it is very likely
that this stock will be sold at
ridiculously low prices unless the
clubs concerned contact Chas
Brereton by 5pm on Monday 31
October.
