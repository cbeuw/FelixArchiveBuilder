Man United v Liverpool (Sunday
1:30pm, Sky Sports 1):
It has all gone horribly wrong for
David Moyes this season but this
is a chance to restore a bit of pride
against United’s big rivals. Make no
mistake, this is a tough ask though
against a Reds outit in irresistible
form. Luis Suarez and Daniel Stur-
ridge look a match made in heaven
and it is actually very hard to see
United winning this even if deci-
sions go their way and they get a
bit of luck. Brendan Rodgers has a
golden opportunity to do the double
over United and I think it’s one he
will take. 1-2
Tottenham v Arsenal (Sunday 4pm,
Sky Sports 1)
he North London derby has added
spice this year, with Spurs needing
a result to maintain any dwindling
hopes of Champions League qualiica-
tion, and Arsenal desperate for points
in order to keep their title hopes alive.
Realistically, whoever loses this will
have their dreams dashed for another
year. Tim Sherwood seems to get the
most out of his players on the road and
Spurs always seem to struggle against
the big teams. hat said, the Gunners
have been blowing hot and cold of late
and after a trip to Germany midweek,
may have to settle for a point. 1-1
Hull v Man City
Even when City were scoring goals for
fun, they would have expected a big
test at the KC Stadium because Steve
Bruce has his side well drilled against
any opponent. hey have already beat-
en Liverpool and this will be tight but
by hook or crook, City need to win. .
1-3
Everton v Cardiff:
Since the appointment of Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer, the Bluebirds have shown
few signs they are capable of a great
escape. Everton have already had their
blip and with Romelu Lukaku back
among the goals, they will be strong
favourites and rightly so. 3-0
Aston Villa v Chelsea (Saturday
5:30pm, Sky Sports 1):
Villa inally produced an encouraging
home display after 4 goals in 17 min-
utes saw of Norwich last time out. By
stark contrast, the Blues’ defence has
been rock solid of late. Jose Mourinho
knows how to grind out 1-0 and 2-0
wins at this stage of the season – he
has been there and done it before
so many times – and he realises it is
simply about results and not perfor-
mances, because they do not have the
lair of Liverpool and Man City. his
has got “Chelsea win to nil” written all
over it.. 0-2
Fulham v Newcastle:
Given the Cottagers’ perilous posi-
tion, Felix Magath has had no settling
in time. He needs his irst win and fast,
but the Magpies looked back to their
best at Hull last time out; their record
at the Cottage is strong and they can
put another nail in Fulham’s coin. 1-2
Southampton v Norwich:
he Canaries badly need to start win-
ning football matches as their run in
at the end of the season is horrendous.
Mauricio Pochettino’s Saints have
been on the end of a couple of hidings
at St Mary’s Stadium recently and I
suspect they may just settle for a point
1-1
Stoke v West Ham
he Hammers are virtually assured of
survival after a brilliant run of form,
but there are few harder grounds to
pick up wins than the Britannia Stadi-
um. Yes, they managed it last season,
but the Potters are still not safe and
have the greater incentive to deliver a
result. 1-0
Sunderland v Crystal Palace
hese sides have produced some im-
portant workmanlike performances
of late and I see both surviving the
drop. Tony Pulis’ Palace side is made
up of ighters and they will push the
Black Cats to the wire. Sunderland’s
extended cup runs could take a toll.

1-1
Swamsea v West Brom
It has been an underwhelming sea-
son for both sets of fans after these
two proved last year’s biggest sur-
prise packages. Now, though, they
are battling for survival. Of the two,
Garry Monk’s Swans look better
equipped in every department and
the Baggies’ recent away form is
poor. 2-1
T
his year’s Bottle Match, the
112th since its conception,
was an away afair, battled out
in Cornwall’s looded depths. After
negotiations with staf a departure
time was settled, and at 1pm on Friday
21st February 150 excitable students
began their arduous trek to Newquay.
Despite a questionable route through
central Bristol at rush hour, and some
even more questionable in-coach ilm
choices, we made good time, arriving
at the campsite before 9pm.
After wrestling with the caravan’s
miniature cooking appliances, the
athletes among us hit the hay, with
the sensible supporters following
soon after. At 7am the coaches to
Camborne got underway, delivering
the hockey players and footballers
irst, followed by the supporters.
he irst ixture of the day was Ladies
Hockey, in which the girls fell behind
early. Soon they were 2-0 down, but
undeterred. After an encouraged
comeback the RSM drew level, and
then surpassed their opponents,
eventually claiming a historic 3-2 win
in what has consistently been a tough
ixture in recent years.
he Football team got underway at a
revisedtimeof10.30am,seeingamuch
larger crowd than they’d experienced
in recent years. his year’s squad are
currently top of their local league and
were expecting an upset against the
recently dominant Camborne outit.
However, despite a number of shots
and headers on goal, as well as a graze
across the woodwork, RSM couldn’t
ind the back of the net. he CSM boys
were more fruitful, scoring 3 goals,
though all agreed the score-line did
not relect the match.
Men’s Hockey, not to be outdone
by the female counterparts, chalked
up a strong 3-0 victory, making it the
irst time (that we know of) where the
RSM has won both Hockey matches.
Before leaving for the Rugby Club
the two Mining Schools squared of
on the netball and basketball courts.
With an RSM victory in Squash (3-
2) and a looding related cancellation
in Golf, the RSM were leading 3
matches to 1 overall. Unfortunately
the pressure was too great, and both
sides fell to their opponents, leaving
the weekend at a tie in the run up to
the Rugby.
We travelled to Penryn Rugby
Club for the inal showdown, with
all but the players looking somewhat
worse for wear (and one or 2 having
already fallen by the wayside). Despite
amiable conditions that afternoon,
the adverse weather in recent days/
weeks/months had taken its toll and
the pitch was heavy and sticky, making
hard work for the players. In the end,
the relatively inexperienced RSM
team, with many representatives from
the MSc cohort (and one Chilean
international), battled well to hold
the Camborne Miners to a 6-6 draw.
his resulted in a dead tie for the
weekend overall. hanks to a strong
win at home in 2013, the RSM were
the current holders of the Bottle, and
so retain the Bottle this year.
Following the suspense of the sport
we all headed to the Rugby Club Bar
for a jar or two, pending the opening
of the Camborne Student Union. At
6.30pm, we made our way over for a
dinner of curry, rice, and poppadoms.
Basic as the meal was, it was nice of
the Camborne committee to heed our
request not to serve pasties, which
have haunted us since 2012.
he night ended in traditional
style with alcohol and a dance-loor
takeover at the Sailor’s Arms in
Newquay, followed by a sleepy taxi
ride home to the caravan site. On
Sunday a brutal 8am wake-up call
found us all accounted for, except one
hockey player who had been waylaid at
the Camborne Union by an attractive
young lady, and upon his return we
departed for London.
After a rare weekend, the RSM
managed to bring the Bottle home
once more, to sit behind the Union
Bar for another year.
