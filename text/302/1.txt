IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, 4th OCTOBER, 1971 No. 302

FREE
P . G . G R A N T S
Following the announcement, in late spring, of a rise in
the value of undergraduate grants comes the news that a
similar rise in value of Post-Graduate Science Research Coun-
cil Studentships will be effected from 1st October 1971.
The grants will rise in three steps yearly from that date as
follows :—
1970/71 1971/72 1972/73 1973/74
£550 £630 £650 £675
Students living
away from home
Students living
at home £425 £485 £500 £520
In addition to this P.G.'s will in future be able to obtain a
reimbursement of travelling expenses incurred over a total
of £15, in any year, and the limit of other income earned by
post graduates which falls into the non-deductible category
has been raised from £100 to £175.
These are all items that N.U.S. have been campaigning for
in the past and items on which Imperial College Union has
brought great pressure, the introduction of the travel allow-
ance proving the value of such pressure. The outstanding issue
being followed at the moment is that of disparity between
P.G. demonstrating fees, and the Union feels that discrepan-
cies between one institution and another must be removed.
In the motion which Imperial College Union will put to the
N.U.S. meeting at Margate in November, they will be wel-
coming these recent successes whilst stressing the fact that
they are still insufficient. The major point which still needs
stressing is the need for a re-evaluation of the method of cal-
culating the S.R.C. grant. The method used at present has the
following structure, the amounts shown being those for 1970-
71:—£380 basic for the period of undergraduate attendance
with an addition of 17 weeks at £1 a day and a general £50
allowance on top of this, which all rounds up nicely to the
present £550.
Post-graduates still do not get a London allowance and
most important is the fact that the expenses incurred in the
production of their theses have to be taken from their main-
tenance grant which has no specific allowance for this. As in
some cases this can amount to £100, an additional allowance
in the final year's grant or a separate money allocation for
this purpose is imperative.
The whole method of evaluating P.G. grants at present does
not take into account the fact that undergraduates have 20
weeks of holiday in which to supplement their income, a privi-
lege not open to P.G.'s.
I.C.U. will be trying to highlight these deficiencies at Mar-
gate but your support will be needed to carry these proposals
through and also to check any government attempt to intro-
duce a system of loans for post-graduates.
PIERS...
College Political victimisation fails
Felix is pleased to report
that the physics department
have not succeeded in throw-
ing out Piers Corbyn, left
wing former president and
editor of SENNET.
During the summer a bat-
tle has been raging between
Piers and the physics de-
partment over the possible
withdrawal of his grant, for
the coming session. The
struggle began in July and
has involved in addition to
Piers and college, the Science
Research Council, for whom
Piers obtains his grant,
ICASTMS, Imperial College
Union, NUS and a few
others, all of whom took up
Piers' case. The battle has
involved mounds of com-
munication between the var-
ious participants and all con-
cerned must be praised for
the way in which everything
was so amicably carried
out.
Piers has been at college
for three years as a PG one
of which he spent as presi-
dent and the other two of
which he was supported by
SRC to do research.
On July 7th he was told
by his supervisor that his
"academic performance dur-
ing the year had not justified
a recommendation to SRC
that his research studentship
be continued for its third
year", but that he could fin-
ish what he was doing and
submit it for a DIC and
M.Phil this October. These
two statements were later
confirmed in writing by a
letter to Piers from his head
of department Professor
Matthews on July 13th.

PHALLUSY TIME
It has come to the notice of FELIX
that a certain Union official, during the
installation of those notorious machines
in the Union bog, received a not in-
considerable number of free samples
from the London Rubber Company.
FELIX are sceptical as to whether
these will be put to use. That is, other
than blowing them up as balloons ! We
wonder whether any Union official will
be able to negotiate a sufficient discount
on these items in order for FELIX to
arrange a free gift this Christmas.
IMPERIAL GASCOIGNE
Apparently, Granada Television have
been rash enough to invite a team from
Imperial College to participate in Uni-
versity Challenge. Four team members
plus one reserve are required. Budding
intellectuals should give their names
and addresses to Linda in the Union
Office. Granada will also arrange a free
trip to Manchester for supporters, 40 in
number, to watch the recording. Appli-
cations also to Linda.
BRUSH OFF
As the tortuous channels of com-
munication reopen, FELIX has receiv-
ed a request, via the Registrar at
R.C.A., the Domestic Bursar, and John
McCullough, in that order, that I.C.
students should not in future use the
refectory at the Royal College of Art.
Apparently, R.C.A. students object to
queuing longer, particularly since the
vast minority of I.C. students made any
effort to integrate in the minutest sense.
Freshers may be interested that R.C.A.
salads were economical, and a very
pleasant change from Mooney's.
W.L.S.A.B.
This means the West London Stu-
dents Accommodation Bureau. This
autumn in the Union Office Mike
Muller (ex I.C.) has been running a
service unrivalled anywhere in London
—an Accommodation Bureau for stu-
dents not run by a couple of old ladies
(mentioning no names). After placing
advertisements in several local news-
papers he has obtained a vast number
of addresses of flats, bedsits and digs
which he has been dishing to students
and the like at the rate of about 30 a
week. He still has many addresses
especially digs so if you are still with-
out a place to live pop into the Union
office and see him.
TENANCY SCHEME IN
RAVENSCOURT PARK
The College recently acquired the
leases of eight flats in Ravenscourt Park
(two minutes from the District line
tube station). The flats are in excellent
condition and are generally better than
those that students would normally
find.
Each of the flats has two cookers,
two sinks, two bathrooms, a refrigera-
tor and similar furnishings. Fifty-eight
students will be housed, mainly in
double rooms but there is also a small
number of single rooms.
This is only a pilot scheme and it is
hoped that if successful there will be a
large expansion into this form of
accommodation as there are no build-
ing or planning worries.
A further advantage is the complete
freedom that the scheme allows the
residents—there are no wardens or sub-
wardens.
FRENCH LETTERS TO THE
EDITOR
Complaints regarding the aforemen-
tioned machine and the contents there-
of should not be addressed to the editor
of FELIX who wishes to stress that he
is in no way responsible. He also denies
that FELIX will be running a contro-
versial "French letters to the editor"
column. Next week: FELIX Consumer
Unit reports. Coming shortly: Road
Test.
