The final loss in running the College catering services last
session is now known to be around £2,313, considerably less
in fact than had been originally feared before the various
economy measures and price rises were put into effect.
Although the College will write off the deficit this year, it is
not willing to do so next session. In an attempt to break even,
a price rise of 8 per cent in the cafeterias was agreed upon,
with effect from Ist August.
UNION LOUNGE
Well, you have got past the title anyway which probably
means you either don't know what the Union Lounge is and
are curious to find out, or you wonder what there is to write
about it, well read on.
The Union Lounge is situated in the ground floor of the
Union Building somewhere between Tarn's office and the
Union Bar. Its only purpose in life up till now has been to
house that relic from the days of I.C's. mascotry, Mike, our
ex-mascot. However since Queen Mary College decided it
would make a nice souvenir and nobody at I.C. can be both-
ered to get it back, our beloved union officials decided to find
a new purpose in life for the lower lounge.
In order to give you some-
thing to do in the evenings
and somewhere to go and do
it, they have had those old
boards listing their pre-
decessors names removed,
moved to the top floor the
old waiting room type chairs,
and repainted the lounge
with a splattering of orange
here and there amongst the
light green. The seating now
consists of comfortable easy
chairs, and low coffee tables
have been installed to prop
up the odd pint or four.
The apology that used to
be known as the ladies bar
is gone and has been re-
placed by a fully stocked
bar which is actually equip-
ped with its own pumps,
(that's one up for Women's
Lib.) The bar also doubles
as a Snack Bar selling all
the best that Mooney
minions can't ruin, with per-
haps even a barmaid for all
you lucky freshers to chat up.
The lighting level has been
decreased and lis being re-
placed partly with coloured
lights which do not flash yet
but should improve the at-
mosphere a lot, who knows
they might be able to lower
the ceiling a few feet which
would make it even better
still. Having set this atmos-
phere they decided to add
further to the attractions by
installing a juke box for those
of you who haven't got your
own record grinder, Pin
tables for you to waste your
grants on and possibly a few
more of those bar football
tables to reduce the queues
at the existing ones. In addi-
tion to all these goodies a
Mooney coffee machine is
being installed for out of
hours drinking, so why not
come along? Why not bring
a few friends? it will make
a pleasant change from the
atmosphere of Southside, you
mieht even find those new

The Catering Manager
had originally asked for a
rise of 13%, but the Union
fought this down to about
8%, on the understanding
that there would be no fur-
ther price rises within the
next 12 months.
The Union won a further
concession — that the prices
in the Union Buttery (open
continuously from 11.00 a.m.
to 6.00 p.m.) would only
rise by 5%, so that snacks
in the Union would be
slightly cheaper than in Col-
lege Block or Southside.
Meanwhile the outlook is
distinctly rosy in the Bars
— too rosy, say Union
officials, looking at the
startling £6,255 profit, repre-
senting nearly 10% of the
turnover! About a quarter
of this profit comes from the
Union Bar, an eighth from
College Block, and the rest
from Southside Bar.
Union officials are con-
cerned that Bar profits
should not subsidise Refec-
tories, though here the Union
The scheme was run this
summer by Sue Rossell, Ian
Burgess, Pete Totterdell and
Tim Russell, with the help
of other I.C. students who
acted as cleaners. Ninety-five
rooms in Linstead were let
for twelve weeks at £1 a
night or £6 a week raising
approximately £3800 for a
new hall or house. Last year
the scheme raised £3000 with
less rooms available for let-
ting; the profit this year
being not as large as expec-
ted because the cleaners
bread increased and also the
laundry bills rose.
Linstead Bar was kept
open over the summer to
provide a drinking place for
the occupants and the takings
trebled over those during
term time, the profits being
used to refurbish and stock
the bar, hence the new tables
and chairs, taped music,
coloured lights and new bar
fittings to be seen in Lin-
stead. The success of the
scheme over the previous two
years has ensured its con-
tinuation next summer.
is at variance with Catering
Manager, Mr. Mooney, and
also with the latest Univer-
sity Grants Committee memo
to Universities, which recom-
mends that the bars should
keep the refectories solvent.
The same U.G.C. memo
also advocates the 'moth-
balling' of surplus facilities,
the need to detect and follow
the trend towards cheaper
meals and snacks, and the
advisability of cutting down
over-elaborate or unecono-
mic services such as week-
end meals, and waitress ser-
vice.
A more detailed report on
the catering services offered
at I.C. was received over
the vacation. The Senior
Catering Advisor to the
U.G.C., Miss F. M . Cowell,
carried out a three day sur-
vey of I.C. refectories in
May, mainly at the request
of the Union.
Her report points out the
gross over-provision of cater-
ing in the College, which was
caused by the opening of
College Block, with eating
After a series of meetings
over the summer it was de-
cided that all rooms not
being used by conferences or
I.C. students next year will
be used either for block
bookings or for casual let-
tings along the lines of Lin-
stead this year. It was also
decided that the profits from
the casual bookings should
go to the Union for improv-
ing student accommodation,
by obtaining leases on flats
for students, for example.
The money from block book-
ings would be divided be-
tween halls and houses to
maintain their present level
of rents,
FELIX thinks that this
allocation of money to keep
hall rents at their present
level is giving gold to the
well-off. Nobody, least of all
FELIX staff, wants to see
hall rents rise but we do feel
that people in hall are well
enough off already and that
the money could 'be better
used to provide more hall-
places so that some of those
not fortunate enough at
present to get into hall will
have a better chance in
future. What about the other
3000 students not lucky
enough to get into hall —
will their rents remain
stable? Surely this is a short-
facilities for 1800, in a year
when student numbers only
increased by 100. The open-
ing of College Block was the
sign for the run-down of faci-
lities in the Union building,
and also, through an addi-
tional wages bill of £16,000,
contributed to the £30,000
deficit that session.
One obvious choice in
rationalising the Refectories
would be to close the Union
building; however, Miss
Cowell points out the un-
desiirability of this, as it
would deal a heavy blow to
the concept of the Union as
the hub of student life. Simi-
larly, the staff dining room
at 170 Queensgate loses
heavily, but this also should
be retained, as it provides an
element of gracious Irving.
However, if 170 is kept open,
Miss Cowell suggests either
finding an alternative source
of money to subsidise it, or
closing some of the other
Staff facilities.
On the management side,
Miss Cowell found the man-
agement was efficient and
the operating staff of good
calibre; but she did recom-
mend the appointment of a
Deputy Catering Manager to
ease the workload — this
has in fact already been
agreed by the College.
The report now has to
wend its way via the various
College Committees for offi-
cial comment.
sighted view. If all the money
was used to acquire new ac-
commodation then more stu-
dents would benefit from
cheaper accommodation in
the long run.
During future vacations it
is hoped to let between 100
and 500 rooms at £1.60 a
night for students. This will
include breakfast in South-
side, and thus help to keep
refectories viable over the
summer.
FELIX wishes Sue Rossell
and Tim Russell the best of
luck with the scheme next
year, but hopes that the
powers that be will have
second thoughts about the
distribution of profits.

John Halas will be lec-
turing at Imperial College
shortly, as a guest of the
Film Society.
As well as being an ex-
pert on the production of
animated films, Mr. Halas
is well known as a speaker
on the subject, and has ap-
peared at the National Film
Theatre.
His lecture will be illus-
trated with several short

from the famous feature-
length film, "Animal Farm".

theses by any fixed date at
this stage.
He also took the some-
what drastic step of submit-
ting a report of his work to
the department without one
being requested. His case
was at this stage taken up
by ICU and ASTMS. Prof.
Matthews refused to listen to
the ASTMS as he said that
they were not supposed to
take up students cases even
though they had fought on
the side of students several
times in the past.
Also at this stage a dis-
agreement started as to
whether or not SRC should
have been previously in-
formed of Piers unsatisfac-
tory state of progress in the
eyes of the department.
N O W A R N I N G
Judith Walker (retiring
President) wrote to Prof.
Matthews on July 22nd mak-
ing the points that:- Piers
had a right to be represen-
ted by ASTMS if he wished;
that he had not been given
adequate warning; trial there
is no college requirement that
Ph.D students have to satisfy
their supervisors of any par-
ticular state of progress by
the end of their second year;
and that Post Graduates have
as many rights as undergra-
duates.
On August 3rd the auth-
orities changed their position
and SRC said that Mr. Cor-
byn's grant could be contin-
ued if the department so
recommended by 30th Sep-
tember. Towards the end of
summer John McCullough,
Union president, joined the
battle by writing to Prof.

CORBYN
BUSTED
One July evening the
drugs squad payed Piers
Corbyn a visit in his shared
flat in Notting Hill. They
had a search warrant for
drugs, soon after entering the
flat they found a filing cabi-
net. So quite naturally for
them, they radioed the
Special Branch who being
just around the corner were
there within five minutes.
The FUZZ found about
£2 worth of hash — not
Corbyns he can't take the
stuff — and arrested Piers
for admitting his premises to
be used for the smoking of
hash. You might think that
was enough but not for the
special branch, they also
accused him of handling
stolen property (i.e. one
traffic cone, one roadside
lamp, and one local auth-
ority sign pertaining to dogs
fouling the footpath).
However the main event
of the night was a search of
his political files during
which the S.B.'s took notes
and asked him numerous
questions. After being kept
in jail for one hour and then
released on £100 bail, being
refused legal aid he appeared
at magistrates court on
Sept. 21st.
Piers pleaded1
guilty and
was committed for trial at
the 'London Sessions. The
case should come up some
time during the coming year.
hoped that Piers' Sennet edi-
torship would not be used to
condemn him as it was an
integral part of London stu-
dent life.
C L I V E J E N K I N S
Anyway the fight dragged
wearily on with a petition
from 24 physics PG's, and
Clive Jenkins lending his
weight to the IC ASTMS,
and Digby Jacks NUS pre-
sident joining in the fun.
Throughout the summer
Piers was working in the
physics department and try-
ing to ignore the political
machinations of IC which
was bubbling on apparently
ignorant of the vacation.
Anyway to cut a long story
short the outcome should
keep Piers out of union acti-
vities for the coming session
and has started the ball roll-
ing for student and Techni-
cal staff acting as a united
concern.
ACCOMMODATION SCHEME
This year, as last year, Linstead Hall was used as a hotel
scheme during the summer vacation. The scheme served two
purposes: to provide cheaper accommodation for students
staying in London over the vacation than otherwise available
and to raise money to be used specifically for providing a new
hall or student house for Imperial College.
