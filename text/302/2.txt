Welcome To All Felix Readers
This year sees a major change in Felix as you no longer
have to pay for it. This means that the few of you who
actually paid for it before can save your money, and the
majority who used to pinch it anyway can now do so with
a clear conscience. In order to recover our small losses' due
to lack of sales income, and a larger print order of 2000,
we are restricting each issue to an eight page format. The
editorial staff will therefore be able to exert more critical
influence on what they print, which should lead to a higher
standard of Felix during the coming year. If you have any
information about your club, society, or team which you
think is worthy of inclusion in Felix, then please drop it in
to the Felix rack in the union building, or give it to Dave
Sugden, Maths II, who will edit Felix this year. Felix at this
time of year is always short of staff and this year is of
course no exception, so if you would like to join Felix for
the coming year look out for our stand on Freshers Day or
come along to press meetings which happen on Tuesdays and
Thursdays at about 12.45 p.m. in the press room at the top
of the Union building (Int. 2881).
I would however like to point out that although the editor
always welcomes articles he reserves the sole right to decide
what articles will be included in Felix and whether an article
should be cut or lengthened to fill the available space.
Finally I would like to wish Dave Sugden and next year's
Felix staff the best of British luck because by God they
need i t
John Rogers.

Right. Now you know.
Don't blame me, you de-
cided to come here, it's not
my fault, if you'd asked me
I'd have told you, but you
probably wouldn't have lis-
tened, it's your choice, noth-
ing to do with me.
What's that, John?
Oh yeah, I forgot. Sorry.
Welcome to Imperial Col-
lege! Get yourself settled in,
have a good look round, this
is a fantastic place! You'll
have the time of your life
here! Make yourself at home
you lucky people!
O.K.?
Right, well, as I was say-
ing, what you do now you're
here doesn't make any sod-
ding difference to me, or any-
one else for that matter, so I
don't see why I should waste
my time playing silly-buggers
to welcome you, but it won't
do any good complaining or
asking you all to piss off, so
I'll get on with it, I suppose.
Have you all got some-
where to live? Easy! You
should find yourself a nice
little self-contained beauti-
fully furnished flat less than
a mile away from college for
a couple of quid a week; that
will set you up nicely for a
good year's uninterrupted
work! Of course you might
find yourself one of the small
majority of students living in
a rat-infested cupboard two
hours from college, complete
with hot and cold running
damp, with half your grant
going in deposit, but that's
your hard luck, mate, sod off
and commute from some-
where cheaper. Like Ux-
bridge. Or Brighton.
Social life? No problem!
Enjoy yourself any way you
like, indulge your every whim.
What are the Union, the
clubs, committees, for but to
help you relax as you want
to? You do like drinking and
watching T V don't you? It
don't bother me if you don't,
please yourself. Mind, doing
ten hours work every night to
keep yourself on a pass
degree might interfere with
your social life, but wait!
Your Union is there to pro-
tect your interests! And be-
lieve me, if the Union this
year is only half as effective
as it was last year, it'll be
twice as effing useless.
A go-ahead personality!
Immerse yourself in Union
politics, become one of the
people in the know! It'll bug-
ger your degree up no end,
won't make you universally
loved, but if masturbating in
public's your cup of tea, that's
your business, you won't be
alone, just keep away from
me, OK?
What else? Some people
like it here. It's got some good
points (like the end of term
—Ed.). It's near the Albert
Hall. And Hyde Park. The
welfare facilities are pretty
good, and the beer's not bad.
And remember, if you have
any problems, anything on
your mind, any worries or
complications at all, don't
hesitate, don't be afraid, go
and find someone to talk to,
anyone, I don't bleeding-well
care, just don't sodding-well
get in my way.
I don't know nothing about
it, hear, it ain't got nothing to
do with me, SOD OFF.
'Colcutf is the pseudonym under which a Union personality,
known only to the Editor, writes in each issue of FELIX.
No doubt, for freshers, your first week or two in College
will show what a lot the Union has to offer, both of a social
and Recreational and of a Service and Representational
nature.
Old lags Will know this already, but they will recognise
that there is always more to be done—some tasks concern
old thorny problems, others concern newer ones, but none
are for that of lesser importance.
Optional Diversification
This is the problem (i.e. to get it) that has been with us
the longest, and if we do not press hard will stay with us the
longest. Many of us have found ourselves trapped, not
realising the full meaning and narrowness of specialized
"education"—often a soul-destroying repetition of lectures
and praeticals and facts and figures on the same subjects
with no attempt made to relate them to the outside world
and especially poorer developed areas where such knowledge
could be put to great use. A few professors and lecturers
are trying, but this should be COLLEGE POLICY—we've
got to show our continued support for them, and aid them.
The Exam S
y
s
t
e
m
is very closely related to the above. Initiative is needed to
help move away from three hour hit-or-miss exams, and the
rigid lecture system to one incorporating assessed projects,
tutorials, open book exams, and maybe eventually continual
assessment.
Representation
is a means to getting some of the important ends listed
above. Much has been achieved, but important power
pockets of resistance, secrecy, and regression must be opened
up. A l l decisions must be taken by the college AS A
WHOLE. We must use what representation we have better,
in order to get our desired aims—make sure it's YOUR
things you want us to do. Come and tell us when we do not
—everyone to the Union Office.
Come round for a chat sometime. I'll try to definitely be
in the Union Office (Beit archway, INT 2488) every Friday
afternoon, to hear what YOU want so say. After all, that is
what is important round here.
John McCullough.
