October 4, 1971 FELIX Page 5
PROOF CHECKING
& NEWS PAGES. . .
On the Sunday before publication the
sports, features, letters and editorial pages
are returned in proof form. This is when
we realise what a mess we made of the
initial layout and articles are again ex-
panded or cut to get them to fit.
At about four o'clock on Sunday when
this stage is finally completed the work
starts on the news pages. The editorial
staff can be again seen scratching their
greying heads and asking what happened
during the week that is interesting and
printable. At the same time as this is hap-
pening, the photographic editor is busily
trying to transform the vertical pictures to
fit horizontal spaces and vice-versa.
The final pages then begin to shape up
by a process not dissimilar to that of the
first pages. One member of the staff is then
detailed to entertain the printers' repre-
sentative, our great friend Mr. Milsom,
while this process is completed with great
haste. He then transports the pages to the
printers who bring these ten days' work
to harsh reality.
The photos below show various views of
the printing machines which produce
FELIX. The process is described in the
captions below the photos.
The photo below shows in greater detail the
process of setting up the type, photos and adverts
in the frames ready for printing. Each frame con-
tains two pages so in fact this whole article has
been set in a frame as shown below. The person in
the picture can be seen setting the clamps con-
tained in the actual frame which hold the material
firmly in position during printing.
Behind the protective grill the pages of
type reciprocate under the printing cylin-
der. The cylinder, complete with sheet of
paper, is iii the centre of the picture.
Above this is a sheet of paper "queuing
up" to be printed.
Here at the back end of the machine, the
board at top holds the unprinted sheets.
Above the pile, the last sheet to be printed
is about to descend.
A battery of the German 'Heidelberg' letterpress printing machines.
When the pages have been
printed they have to be col-
lated together to form the
newspaper. The photograph
below shows the folding
machine used to fold the
double pages in half. The girl
in the photograph can be
seen feeding the printed sheets
into the machine by hand.
The photo on the right is
a general view of the work-
shop where the type is set.
The news pages thus follow
the same process as the ear-
lier pages but are not returned
for proof reading because of
lack of time, instead they are
checked for any obvious
errors at Bailey's. Greater
care is therefore needed over
i » f •
the last pages to try and
ensure they fit the available
space.
The picture below shows
the exterior of the printing
works of F. Bailey and Son
at Dursley in Gloucestershire.
The two thousand copies of
FELIX are finally completed
by Bailey's on the Tuesday
and Wednesday before pub-
lication and transported to
London by the illustrious Mr.
Milsom.
AND FINALLY f ^ - f H ^ B f f "
TO Y O U . . .
During the Wednesday
afternoon and evening the
unfortunate Editor of Felicity
works his fingers to the bone,
collecting and, where neces-
sary inventing instant news to
fill Felicity. He then embarks
on a mini version of the pre-
parations for FELIX, but as
he is also the printer things
are a lot quicker, especially if
he gets some assistance.
§§§§1
Vast quantites of paste letraset and limitless supplies of
patience are poured on to an odd scrap of paper. This is
turned into a stencil which looks surprisingly tidy by com-
parison. Now into print. The revered old Felicity head stencil
is exhumed from the archives behind the dustbin and virgin
paper is deflowered with the contents of FELICITY.
The final glowing masterpiece, still hot from the presses,
or duplicator as we call it, is collated, along with any pieces
of advertising bumph we have been given, into its parent
paper.
Bundles are now assembled in mysterious fashion, by the
circulation people, and the beautiful creation at last graces its
newsstands in the deserted hours of early Thursday.
You now give it a brief glance, before making it into a
paper dart, or if you are one of the rare ones, actually read it.
If it interests you, perhaps you will do your bit for the next
issue by contributing something from your club or society, or
even, as a last resort, joining our staff.
So if you feel gifted with writing ability, you own a camera
or have some knowledge of developing, or both, can brew tea
or fetch beer from below, then come along to a press meeting
and say so. These are on Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes,
at about 12.45. So anyone can come and do a little — there's
always plenty to do !
