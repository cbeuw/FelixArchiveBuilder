THE FUTURE OF I.C.
Probably one of the most complex of problems today is planning for
an uncertain future. Even in the simplified case of our own college, the
problem can be taken to almost unlimited depths. How does one allow
for technical innovation or the whim of some future group of school-
leavers, neither of which follow well-behaved curves. Thanks to the
writers, who in their own way, give valuable pointers as to what IC can
expect.

about developments for per-
sonal reasons . . . It was
Professor (now Lord)
Blackett who I believe
coined the title 'Professorial
Barons' and this labels some
of those who care for per-
sonal reasons. There are
those who glory in their sub-
ject . . . I have heard a sen-
ior Physics Professor say: 'If
Physics students have any
spare time, then they should
use it for doing more Phys-
ics' . . . and this affects the
development of Imperial
College. There are those who
care for Imperial College as
part of their job and the
results of their efforts are
seen in the new buildings.
Regrettably these are too
small. A size nearer to 20
stories is needed for each
technology to provide a bal-
ance in space between new
and dying points. The Safe
Loading Weight for the new
buildings is 1 cwt./square
foot and if this is forgotten
and if the buildings fill up
with persons and equipment,
it could be that one day
many of them will fall down.
It may be thought that
there are only a minority
who 'care' but this is not so.
All over the College people
show that they care by add-
ing personal touches to offi-
ces, workshops, stores and
labs . . . these are every-
where, from the pinned up
cartoon, that is pertinent to
somebody working nearby,
to the exotic plant, that
thrives on the central heat-
ing. Over the years the hier-
archical system in Imperial
College has exerted direct
and indirect pressure on in-

Felix gave me some holiday homework and
asked me to write about the future of the College.
Two methods are commonly used as an aid to plan-
ning for the future. One is to take data from the last
few years and project a growth rate. The other is to
make a "market" survey. Both methods are fallible.
Projections of total U . K . fuel demand have gone
awry; and we are all watching to see if Concorde
will achieve its predicted market.

In my opinion, the College has no future as 'Im-
perial College'. Although the name is apt enough,
since overseas students are still taught a science
more relevant to imperialism than the technologi-
cal needs of their own countries.
If I.C. is to survive as a true institute of higher
education it must go out — towards the nearby
community, to society at large to the liberation of
the Third World. A t present the College — or
rather the professors and lecturers with private
consultancies — relates very well to the outside
world of big business, the miltary and government,
but not so well to its students or to the people. Y e t
paradoxically the very graduate processed by the
Imperial College system is out of favour vs ith em-
ployers.
A market survey about
university places would esti-
mate the numbers of school
students each year reaching
present university entrance
standards. It seems to be
generally agreed that over a
decade the numbers might
double. There is little pros-
pect that the number of uni-
versity places will double
over ten years—the capital
cost is too great. Pro rata,
Imperial College could grow
by more than 300 students
per year compared with an
average of 130 per year over

the last few years. We have
been given general guidance
to plan for 210 extra each
year and sightly to reduce
the proportion of postgrad-
uates.
So the College will grow
steadily. More interesting,
perhaps, is whether the Col-
lege will change from its
strong departmental struc-
ture with highly specialised
courses. In spite of the many
changes since I was a stud-
ent, the ethos of the College
has hardly changed at all.
The majority of our stud-
ents have always wanted a
specialised course and have
been willing to work hard
for a good degree. They have
expected, and usually ob-
tained, a good job using
their speciality. There is
now, I believe, a need to
broaden the options, to have
more interdisciplinary possi-
bilities at the undergraduate
level, to integrate some of
our groups (e.g. biology) in-
to Divisions or Institutes,
with some common courses
and also, within the limits
of our finance, to provide
more carefully chosen cours-
es in some fields outside
science or technology. We
must, I suppose, continue to
have the honours degree
with its classes for the fore-
seeable future but we should
extend the basis on which
the assessment is made, in
the directions some depart-
ments are already moving.
If the national economy
deteriorates, the resources
available to the College will
be reduced but these educa-
tional changes should go
ahead. The present industrial
recession is partly connected
with changes in the pecking
order. The technical society
in which we live has many
sensitive spots where pressure
can be exerted on the sys-
tem. However, the modern
industrial state could not sur-
vive, with its population
numbers and its standards of
living, without efficient and
progressive technology. I
therefore cannot visualise the
technologist and the applied
scientist losing the influen-
tial positions they have to-
day. The College will con-
tinue to have national im-
portance. Less certain is
whether we can fill all our
places with good Students
willing to make the effort
which science and technology
demand.
The next few years will see
further liberalisation for
student participation in cen-
tral and local College affairs
but we must surely avoid the
extreme positions taken in
some other countries, where
sooner or later academic
quality is bound to suffer.
The most serious College
problem where no complete
solution is yet in sight is
Student accommodation. We
need an extra 400 places in
six years time. Money given
to the Appeal will enable
us to provide at most only
half this number. Apart
from this, the College can
look to the future with con-
siderable confidence.
EDUCATION'S
NO PRIVILEGE
Jobless graduates will
soon be used as a cudgel by
the Tories to 'regretfully'
call a halt to expansion in
higher education. But elitism
is no longer acceptable —
everyone has the right to
continue his or her educa-
tion. The degree is no job
passport, nor should it be.
Education is more than
vocational training on the
cheap for a job in big busi-
ness.
IC IS KILLING
SCIENCE
Education here should
mean the teaching of socially
related technology. Science
is anything but politically
neutral, so why should it not
be turned to the needs of the
people? (One good answer—
because capitalism does not
work like that!!) Why isn't
the College (not just the
union) helping the people of
Notfing Hill—our neigh-
bourhood, we have the tech-
nology and the people? Be
warned—diversification will
come to I.C., but there will
be no fundamental change—
no university preaches its
own destruction.
YOUR LOCAL
COM-
PREHENSIVE ?
The only form of educa-
tion which could be accept-
able as a future would have
no selection procedures (e.g.
the City College of New
York), no restricting exams,
no discrimination. Discrimin-
ation?—is that the reason
why there are so few women,
so few British black Stud-
ents, and only 30% or so
working class students? They
have had little chance, op-
pressed by the capitalist sys-
tem all along the line, to
make it to the citadel.
I.C. looks down on the
technical colleges yet is it-
self only a 'high class' ver-
sion.
In fact, relatively speak-
ing, some of I.C.'s courses
are narrower than at 'lesser'
institutions. The so-called
Binary system relegates the
technical colleges, colleges of
education, and the poly-
dividuals to prevent them
from doing anything about
the development of I.C. It is
only recently that this pres-
sure has been blocked and
the voice of those who care
about the people forming
I.C. Community has become
strong.
The future of I.C. lies
with this latter group since
they face up to the basic
need of life. Consequently
assuming this is so, it is
likely that in 20 years time,
I.C. will start to be com-
pletely rebuilt as an inter-
disciplinary college with no
clear separate departments
and centred around a central
computer complex. At some
point in time before then,
there will be a massive
change in environmental
conditions which will in-
clude re-designing the open
spaces, making the whole
precinct a pedestrian only
area with vastly improved
cultural and recreational
facilities, and cleaning the
air of the city pollutants . . .
technics (still) to a second
class status, with much less
money for many more stud-
ents, often crowded into old-
er buildings.
Equal opportunity for all
means an end to the ini-
quitous binary division
which keeps the majority of
students (in non-university
colleges) down.
IC NO:
USK YES:
USK, the student-inspired
'University of South Ken-
sington', could be the model
for the future—the bringing
together of all the institutes
in Kensington. These first
Steps towards uniting the
students have, however, been
taken by the Unions and not
the College authorities. The
comprehensive university is
a logical step, which will
have to be fought hard for.
It's students may Study full
or part time, but in either
case they should receive a
wage rather than a grant.
'The student wage assumes
that higher education is pro-
ducing an economically
desirable output i.e. the
economy needs you. 'The
loan sees higher education as
a personal consumer good'.
Student unions are becom-
ing more like trade unions
and in industry the white
collar workers (i.e. you, the
technocrat) unionise.
How can the future be
changed and I.C. destroyed/
reconstructed? The college
will not dissolve the depart-
ment structure, be governed
by a general assembly and
become a community college
by sweet reason. And re-
pressive tolerance is a British
byword—despite the present
government. Think and act.
The future lies the way of
Lennon, Jackson, Freedom
brothers.
