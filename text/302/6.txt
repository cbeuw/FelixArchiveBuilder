Boat Glub Successes
The Boat Club have been
extremely successful over the
last season, and have accu-
mulated a vast amount of
silverware for their efforts.
In the University of Lon-
don Allom Cup regatta IC
overwhelmed the other con-
stituent colleges to win five
out of eight points. In the
Open event, the Allom Cup,
a very strong IC crew con-
taining Four Purples made
easy work of Middlesex
Hospital and U.C.&H. In the
Junior division the going was
a bit tougher, the 2nd VIII
holding off Guys Hospital to
win the Roderick-Hill tro-
phy. The highest number of
entries was in the Novice
division, where IC beat the
favourites Middlesex Hos-
pital and then went on to
win in the final against
Q.M.C. and Guys. The final
was a most traumatic affair
with 6 catching a crab 30
seconds from the finish, but
IC recovered their compos-
ure to win by 2 lengths. IC
also won the coxless IV's and
the pairs.
The outstanding crew in
the club have been the 2nd
VIII who through the deter-
mination of their captain
Andy Hill won Juniors at
Brent regatta, after having
picked up U.L. Juniors two
weeks previously.
Victory also came to the
1st VIII in the Metropolitan
Regatta, where they beat
Westminster School and
London 'B' to Win the cov-
eted Forster Cup.
In coxless IV's IC won at
Cambridge Regatta. The
crew was: D. H . Bardsley,
P. Rowley, B. Mc Doual, C.
Nicholls.
The results of the internal
regatta were as follows:
Pairs: D. Sorton, V. C.
Spencer. Senior Sculls: A.
Ponsford. Junior Sculls: H.
Evans. Novice Sculls: S.
Rotherham.
New members will be
made very welcome, no pre-
vious rowing necessary —
and coxes too. B. N. Black.
ater-Polo
in Yugoslavia
The Yugoslavs won the
1968 water-polo Olympics.
They also have an exquisite
coastline bordering the Ad-
riatic Sea. What better place
could there be for an enjoy-
able holiday and an oppor-
tunity to see some very pro-
fessional water-polo. With
this in mind, the I.C. water-
polo club arranged for a ten
day tour to Yugoslavia in
mid-August.
Water-polo is a passion in
Slavic countries. In Yugo-
slavia, 5it ranks second to
football as the national

sport. Every child living by
the sea or near a pool will
eventually come into con-
tact with this sport. There-
fore it is understandable
that the quality is very high
and that much can be gained
from contact with Yugoslav-
ian teams, LC. did not win
very many matches during
their stay. However they did
learn a great deal from some
very high class players. The
advice and suggestions were
given freely and most of all
enthusiastically. Improve-
ment was visible over the
period of our short ten day
stay. It consisted mainly in
a rearrangement of our
priorities. To play good
water-polo, three qualities
are desirable in a player:
good swimming, good ball
handling and good shooting.
Over and above this, a team
must be able to play a coher-
ently and cannot rely on in-
dividual superstars. Most
British teams have good in-
dividual players but seem to
lack the skill of playing as
a team. I think this fact was
demonstrated quite clearly
to us during our stay.
On the lighter side, what
is there to be said about our
holiday? Oh the usual I
guess: blue sky, sunshine,
clear cool water, good food,
cheap wine, all that sort of
thing.
One last thing. In Yugo-
slavia, you may be surprised
to learn that it's difficult to
get a seat to watch a water-
polo match unless you come
very early.

F E L I X F I L M R E V I E W S
'Soldier Blue' is one of
those unfortunate films that
every time it opens its
mouth it lets out a cliche.
The final massacre is a mix-
ture of 'The Wild Bunch'
stylistics and crude close-ups
of amputated limbs and
dripping gore. Symbolic
massacre aside 'Soldier Blue'
is a fairly average Western
with almost two hours of
yawn producing celluloid.
It's a shame about Luch-
ino Visconti being such a
variable quantity in the
Cinema: his last film, 'The
Damned', was a very bad
film but his latest film,
'Death in Venice', is a mas-
terpiece. The excellently
filmed story of a German
composer's (Dirk Bogarde)
emotional attraction to a
young Polish boy (Bjorn
Anderson). The film is beau-
tifully photographed, acted
and directed. Dialogue is
kept to a minimum and the
attraction between the com-
poser and the boy comes
over very well even though
they never speak to each
other. Altogether the decay-
ing splendour of Venice in
191.1 is the atmosphere that
Visconti has managed to
capture in this excellent film.
I'm sure that Tchaikovsky
wasn't as troubled by sex as
Ken Russell portrays him in
his film 'The Music Lovers'.
His story attributes all his
problems to his sex life. But
ignoring the basic premises
of the script the film is very
good. It is in no way as good
as 'Death in Venice' but it
was a very good film. Ken
Russell is a relative new-
comer to films coming from
television where his films on
other composers also used
the same basic premise as in
'The Music Lovers'. His
grasp of film techniques is
excellent and he has used
them to the full. Yet his
handling of one major incid-
ent in Tchaikovsky's life (his
attempted suicide) where he
changed the attempted
drowning on a bitterly cold
night to a short paddle on a
Summer afternoon. The
music is very good (but a
little loud) and the fantasy
scene for the 1:812 Overture
was very enjoyable. Overall
a film worth seeing if only
to compare it with the pro-
posed film on Tchaikovsky
which ought to be very simi-
lar ito 'Song of Norway' and
very Hollywood-ish.
A couple of films that are
really for aficionados of
the stars: Pennebaker's
'Don't Look Back': the doc-
umentary film of Bob
Dylan's tour of England in
1965. And 'Joan' (American
title 'Carry it on') about
Joan Baez or more particu-
larly her husband David
Harris, and is a document-
ary of Joan's life just before
and after he went to prison
(for resisting the draft). Both
films are made in the best
tradition of cinema-verite.
This is where you have to
really like the artists, be-
cause you can't hear the dia-
logue for most of the time;
a lot of the dialogue ha
'Don't Look Back' was, ap-
parently very amusing, and I
didn't hear a word: a lot of
the dialogue in 'Joan' was
very meaningful and again I
didn't hear a word. I'm not
complaining about all the
cinema - verite techniques;
the camera movements can
be very effective, but it
wouldn't take too much
Summer
Conferences
Each year the main lecture
theatres in Imperial College
are let out to various noted
institutions and societies so
that they can hold their
annual get-togethers, and the
College can make some
money. Among the more in-
testing was the 2nd World
Conference on Smoking and
Health. This attracted several
noted people, including Tory
Minister of Health (what
about school milk?) At the
end of the week of lectures
an International Campaign
was launched against smoking
(retiring editor of FELIX
please note).
Another conference was en-
titled Disaster Technology. It
was run by an I.C. student
John Murlis, who had been to
Bangla Desh doing relief
work. Whilst there he felt
that there were several in-
adequacies in the work being
done by the so called relief
organisations out there, and
so he and other students
started a group called the
London Technical Group to
investigate the many prob-
lems facing these organisa-
tions.
One conference, which slip-
ped by almost unnoticed was
one sponsored by NATO. It
seemed to be a gathering of
all the world's greatest Uran-
ium geologists. In a time when
there is increasing opposition
to military research projects
at I.C. perhaps it would be a
good idea if the organisations
using I.C. facilities should be
vetted to see if their aims are
in agreement with those of
the students.

they join!) is being shown at
I.C. in February. This was
yet another film that was ig-
nored by the distributors. I
shall review the film nearer
the showdate because the
chances of seeing ait in a
commercial cinema are very
slim, but it is well-worth
seeing so go to see it when
it comes to I.C.
