In addition (to I.C., the
other Colleges involved in
this effort are Byam Shaw
School of Art and Painting,
the Institut Francais (I.F.),
Queen Elizabeth College
(QEC), Maria Assumpta
College (MA), Royal Col-
lege of Art (RCA), Royal
College of Music (RCM),
and the West London Col-
lege.
Each College will have its
own rag committee which
will be responsible for in-
dividual efforts, but in addi-
tion there will be a co-ord-
inating committee consisting
of representatives from
each College. The combined
effort will be called S.U.K.

The USK Rag Committee
will have its offices in the
former Committee Room B,
at the foot of the east stair-
case in the Union Building,

Chairman, and the USK
entertainments co-ordinator),
Pete Clark (Treasurer), and
Phil Jeanes (USK Stunt co-
ordinator). Any of these will
be pleased to welcome any
offers of help and/or new

This year in addition to
Tiddleywinks up Oxford
Street and a Channel swim
(?) There will be an excellent
rag mag to be sold as a focal
point for other activities.
There will be a Rag Fort-
night from February 19th to
include a rag walk, Ragballs,
concerts, etc. But collections
and local stunts will take
place all year to finance the
escapades of rag fortnight.
Charities
The money raised will be
split in the following way:
164% goes to each of:
NSPCC, Multiple Sclerosis
Society, Mental Health Trust,
Beauchamp Lodge Settle-
ment and the St. Mungo
Community. The remainder
will be split 2\% each to
Advise, Release, St. George's
Men's Care Unit, Notting Hill

Trust, Samaritans, and West-
minster Human Rights Com-
mittee.

Academic
Affairs
This article by Ian Mackenzie, I.C.U. Academic Affairs
Officer, is aimed at clearing up the great "What is Academic
Affairs?" mystery.
Academic Affairs is a subject of student activity that on
the whole receives very little publicity, yet it is the one area
that concerns and involves every student, whether u.g. or
p.g. In (the broadest sense, it covers everything to do with
your education here at Imperial College from straightfor-
ward complaints about a poor lecturer to fundamental
questions such as "Should we be getting a more specialised
or more general education?" or "What should be the scien-
tists' role vis-a-vis the community?"
STAFF/STUDENT COMMITTEES
One of the main concerns is collecting students' views and
putting them across to the staff. The heart of Academic
Affairs is the STAFF/STUDENT COMMITTEE (one in
each department) where staff and students discuss any
departmental matter from an unsatisfactory course to the
provision of common-room facilities. Staff are always willing
to hear suggestions for improvements and numerous changes
in courses are made yearly as a result of student opinion.
Each u.g. year has at least one ACADEMIC REP on this
committee (the first year elect theirs near the end of October).
He should be constantly probing you for your Views and
keeping you informed. In addition, there should be at least
one p.g. rep on the committee—to enable p.g's. to become
more involved—and two other students:
The first is the I.C.U. Departmental Rep (one for each
department); he (or she!) is the main organiser on the
student Side and resident 'expert' on what's what! The
second is the Constituent College Academic Affairs Officer,
Who? Why?
who sits on all the S.S.C.s in his college, and hence co-
ordinates their activities.
Finally, it's my job to co-ordinate the whole lot through
the I.C.U. Academic Affairs Committee, which has the three
Constituent College Academic Affairs Officers and all the
Department Reps on it. This is where overall student policy
is formulated.
REPRESENTATION
On a wider front, I.C.U. has gained a good deal of repre-
sentation in the last two years on important College com-
mittees. For example, the President and the four Academic
Affairs Officers are on the BOARD OF STUDIES, which,
chaired by the Rector, decides basic Academic policy for the
College. We're now beginning to use these opportunities
properly to put over student views at the highest level. And
so, albeit slowly, students are becoming more involved in
future plans for Imperial College.
The other side of Academic Affairs is to encourage you
to think more about your education, and one of the major
issues in the last couple of years has been student pressure
for the option of a less specialised education.
To try to stimulate some greater interest, we're organising
a series of three informal lunch-time discussions (tea and
sandwiches available) to be held in the UNION SCR (that's
above the lower lounge) at 12.30-1.30, on Friday 15th, 22nd
and 29th October. The first one's called "THE SCIENTIST
IN SOCIETY"—there will be two speakers. So come along,
Freshers and old lags alike!
