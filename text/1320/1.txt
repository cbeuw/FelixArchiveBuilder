Charing Cross Hospital
set to close?
By Dave Edwards
Editor
One of Imperial College’s
main teaching sites for medi-
cal students faces closure,
according to national news-
paper reports published dur-
ing the Easter break.
Consultants at Charing
Cross Hospital, in Hammer-
smith, told the media that
“closing the Charing Cross...
is the only realistic possibil-
ity” to combat the local NHS
trust’s huge debts and main-
tenance costs. The hospital’s
main services would transfer
to the Hammersmith hospital
in Acton, but no-one knows
what the future will hold for
Imperial College teaching at
the site.
According to an article in
The Observer, “consultants
at both hospitals were told of
the plans last week, but were
warned by their chief execu-
tive that it would be officially
denied if the plans emerged
in the run-up to [general
election] polling day”. The
electorate’s opinions on any
closure or partial closure
could dramatically influence
the result in the key mar-
ginal seat of Hammersmith
and Fulham, where Labour
currently holds a majority of
around 2,000.
The plans are likely to be
officially unveiled in June,
and there will be a full public
consultation before any final
decisions are made.
In a statement, Derek
Smith, chief executive of
HammersmithHospitalsNHS
Trust, announced: “We expect
to have to spend up to £400m
on renewing our estate dur-
ing the next ten years. With
that level of investment, we
have to look at all the options
available to us to demonstrate
that what we’re planning is
the best way of spending pub-
lic funds. We are looking at
options at the moment, but
as yet have no plans, so have
nothing yet to consult on, and
are unlikely to have for some
time yet.”
Professor Stephen Smith,
Principal of the Imperial
College Faculty of Medicine,
responded: “Hammersmith
Hospitals NHS Trust is cur-
rently considering a range
of options with respect to
their service configura-
tion. Imperial College would
expect that any substantial
alteration in services would
take into account the appro-
priate arrangements for any
transfer of our undergradu-
ate and postgraduate educa-
tion, and honour the provi-
sions for our research activity
and facilities.”
Lucy Pickard, President of
Imperial College School of
Medicine Students’ Union,
told Felix: “It’s difficult to say
what situation we would be
in if Charing Cross closed.
It’s understandable that stu-
dents are very worried about
it. We would like to maintain
the medical school’s facilities,
and if that means we need to
fight for them, we will.”

Union
reveals
plans for
postgrad
sabbatical
By Dave Edwards
Imperial College Union
has announced ambitious
plans for a new Sabbatical
Officer, the Deputy President
(Graduate Students).
Funding for the post will
become available from the
Higher Education Funding
Council for England
(HEFCE). Within the next
two months, the Union plans
to elect a student who will
then work full-time in the
role from 1 August, taking the
total number of sabbaticals at
Imperial to seven.
Mustafa Arif, the President,
told Felix: “Everyone rec-
ognises that postgraduate
representation is a problem,
and in our QAA [Quality
Assurance Agency] submis-
sion it was highlighted as a
major weakness. The College
has accepted that and we
have ringfenced money from
HEFCE available next year
to fund an extra sabbatical to
look over the whole remit of
postgradute activity.”
The Deputy President
(Graduate Students) will
focus on academic represen-
tation, postgraduate welfare,
postgraduate involvement in
student activities and other
issues.
The plans must still be
approved by the Union and
College Councils, but Sam
Rorke, the Deputy President
(Education and Welfare), said
he was confident of having a
“champion for postgraduate
affairs” in place for the 2005-6
academic year.
Only postgraduates will be
eligible to stand for election,
but all students will be able
to vote.
Charing Cross Hospital, a centre of learning for Imperial College medical students, may have to close
“Closing the
Charing Cross...
is the only
realistic
possibility”
