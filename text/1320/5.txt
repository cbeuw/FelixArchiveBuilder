We don’t like to talk about it.
Most of the time, we try to
ignore it. Death. To many, it
is the ultimate taboo subject.
It is said that Alexander the
Great scoured his empire in
search of an elixir of immor-
tality. At the height of his
empire, Ghengis Khan called
upon a Chinese priest to ask
him the secret of everlasting
life – right until the end, Khan
complained that death was
the only force preventing him
from conquering the world.
Throughout history, humans
have sought a solution to the
problem of death. It forms
part of our universal culture.
Today, there are some who
are attempting to find an elix-
ir. One such seeker, Aubrey
de Grey, is either a vision-
ary or a loon. Judging from
his outward appearance, he
is a bit of both. Despite his
long, wispy beard, he looks
far younger than his 42 years
would suggest. He puts this
down to a carefully planned,
wholesome diet and listening
to his mother. Sitting cross-
legged in front of an assorted
audience of experts and non-
experts at the Darwin Centre,
he outlined his views.
De Grey believes that some
humans alive today will go on
to live for more than a thou-
sand years. A ludricous pipe-
dream? Thankfully for him,
he is also an expert in geron-
tology (the study of ageing) at
Cambridge University. But De
Grey’s background is actually
in computer engineering. He
believes that the problem of
ageing can be solved and that
the elixir will take the form of
an engineering solution.
In its most simplistic form,
De Grey’s argument is
appealing. Ageing is a disease
like any other. Modern medi-
cine, taken to its logical con-
clusion, should prevent death
(or ‘deanimation’ as De Grey
likes to call it) as a result
of ageing. Once the relevant
medical tools have been engi-
neered, there is no reason
why humans would have to
die of ‘old age’.
Of course, put in such glib
terms, it is too easy to over-
look the practical difficulties.
There are a few. Despite the
progressmadeinrecentyears,
the causes of ageing have not
been fully understood. There
is no consensus on whether
accumulating DNA mutation,
telomere shortening after
DNA replication or any other
such mechanisms can alone
explain why we age.
One evolutionary theory
suggests senescence is a con-
sequence of natural selection.
The reason why we age is
because the damaging genes
that are activated in old age
are not selected against ear-
lier in our reproductive life.
These genes survive natural
selection. But remarkably,
senescence is also not univer-
sal and there are species in
which ageing has a neglige-
able effect.
Beyond the practical dif-
ficulties, Aubrey de Grey’s
vision is questionable on a
sociological level. If individu-
als were living for hundreds
of years, what consequences
would this have for society?
In a country that is already
struggling under a mounting
pensions burden, do we really
want more old people?
So, perhaps thankfully,
according to experts such
as Jay Oshlansky at the
University of California,
“nothing in gerontology even
comes close to fulfilling the
promise of dramatically
extended lifespan”. In his
view, the likes of De Grey are
weaving another “seductive
web of immortality”, one that
has been woven since time
immemorial.
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to find out wheth-
er humans will colonise other
planets, to see the moment of
first contact between humans
and an alien race? So can we
be forgiven for believing in
what De Grey has to say?
The truth is that without
any major breakthroughs, the
science of immortality consti-
tutes better subject matter
for an episode of Doctor Who
than a viable area for con-
certed scientific research.
There are two problems:
one is the sheer complexity
of the challenge, the other is
that not everyone actually
wants to live forever.
Maybe, for these reasons,
gerontologists should be more
focused on improving quality
of life rather than trying to
flog the dream of immortal-
ity... again.

As evidence for global warm-
ing stacks up, it is the speed
of change that is now alarm-
ing scientists. As a result, cli-
matologists are turning to our
geological record to investi-
gate what may have ampli-
fied global warming events
in the past and how quickly
we might expect things to
change in the future.
At the beginning of the
Eocene period, 55 million
years ago, the Earth warmed
very rapidly by an unprec-
edented amount. In some
places, temperatures rose by
eight degrees in a few thou-
sand years. In 1995, geologist
Gerald Dickens put this down
toanenormous‘burp’ofmeth-
ane released from soils and
from beneath the ocean floor.
Since methane is a green-
house gas, the trillions of
tonnes of methane that were
released into the atmosphere
acted like an enormous blan-
ket, warming things up and
causing sea-levels to rise. The
trigger for the belch, however,
is unclear; it could have hap-
pened as ocean temperatures
rose above a certain thresh-
old, or due to a comet impact
or a sea floor landslide.
The evidence for the
Eocene global warming event
comes from ocean-drilling
experiments near Antarctica.
Fossils of shells and plank-
ton extracted from bore holes
allow geologists to construct a
detailed chronology of events,
based on the carbon and oxy-
genisotoperatiostheycontain
that vary over time. The car-
bon-12 isotope timeline shows
an abrupt spike, indicating a
huge massive release of car-
bon-12 into the atmosphere
55 million years ago. At the
same time there is a sudden
leap in the proportion of oxy-
gen-18 isotope in the fossils,
corresponding to an increase
in sea temperatures of seven
or eight degrees.
The best explanation to
date, Dickens’ methane-burp
theory, ascribes the carbon
spike to methane escaping
from ice in Arctic tundra soil
and frozen stores beneath the
sea floor. The warming cli-
mate may then have affected
ocean circulation, so that
once a tipping point had been
reached, warm water was
channelled down to the crys-
tallized hydrates. This desta-
bilised methane hydrates in
the ice, which are extreme-
ly sensitive to changes in
temperature and pressure,
releasing the methane gas.
Some of this methane com-
bined with dissolved oxygen
to produce water and carbon
dioxide.
Since both carbon dioxide
and methane are greenhouse
gases, this accelerated glo-
bal warming and destabilised
more methane hydrates in a
positive feedback loop. Global
temperatures were then
reduced over the following
100,000 years by increased
amounts of vegetation, ocean
phytoplankton and erosion.
Then another rapid episode
of global warming occurred
during the Jurassic period,
about 180 million years ago.
The same underlying mech-
anisms causing these runa-
way greenhouse events still
exist today. Jan Zalasiewicz,
of the University of Leicester,
pointed out that for these
ancient global warming
events, the Earth reacted
non-linearly to environmen-
tal stresses. “A small amount
of warming triggered a cata-
strophic release of methane,”
he says. “It’s difficult to model
or predict”.
Furthermore, things can
deteriorate quickly even with-
out a methane burp. In the
last glacial ice sheet melt,
sea-levels rose by five to ten
metres in only a decade. Also
the biosphere’s ability to soak
up the damage is weaker than
that of pre-human times. All
in all, the Kyoto commitment
to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by 5% might not
be enough to avoid another
tipping point.
Fear that giant ‘burp’ could trigger global warming
Aubrey De Grey: a visionary or a loon?

Who wants to live forever?
Is ageing just another disease that can be eliminated by modern medicine or an unconquerable
force of nature? Darius Nikbin attended a talk at the Darwin Centre by a prophet of immortality
“...some humans
alive today will go
on to live for more
than 1000 years”
Is our climate poised to suddenly change?
