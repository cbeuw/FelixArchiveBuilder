THEATRE
Oh Kevin Spacey. So many critics are
disappointed in you. You swoop over
from the United States, buy yourself
a theatre, pick out a few plays and
star in all of them. Can you see how
that might look a bit pretentious?
Not to mention that when any actor
makes a move as bold as that, the
theatre community doesn’t need jus-
tification when they sit back, cross
their arms and say, “Right, let’s see
how he’s going to pull this off.”
National Anthems is set in the
1980s in a Detroit suburb. Arthur
Reed, played by Steven Weber, and
his wife Leslie, played by Mary
Stuart Masterson, are greeted by an
offish neighbour Ben Cook, played by
Spacey, as he waltzes in one evening
and introduces himself. The evening
to follow is full of absurdity, hilarity,
and fraught with emotion.
I want you to take a deep breath
before this bit of information: Kevin
Spacey has played this role before,
in 1988 when the play was called
The Party Crasher. I found that a
bit disconcerting. Let us go back
to the beginning scenario. Spacey
saunters to London, purchases the
Old Vic, picks a few plays and stars
in all of them – but one of the first
plays he chooses is something he’s
already done before?
Bravo, Spacey, way to be original.
The theatre community is smug and
awaiting your next move, now you
really have to prove yourself.
Stuart Masterson’s experience as
a screen actor was present on stage.
She made too much of an effort to
actually act. But as the perform-
ance went on, she relaxed into her
role and I became more willing to
believe her.
Spacey and Weber complimented
each other wonderfully; they carried
the performance as if it were a deli-
cate feather for all to see. Spacey’s
acting skills are not on the line here.
He is a very talented man, but with
that talent, he has a lot to live up to.
To get the credit he deserves, he
needs to work a little harder.
All bitterness aside, the play was
decent. The script was well written
and the actors delivered a proper
performance. I do think that Spacey
should have chosen a different play.
If this play was in any other theatre,
with actors of any other name, it
would have been seen as a remark-
able and delightful. But with all the
hype that Spacey has been given,
this wasn’t anything more than a
pleasant evening out.
Perhaps I’m not a fan of modern
theatre. Like modern art for some,
it can be hard to appreciate because
the issues beingg dealt with are
issues that we confront every day.
Even though the issues are impor-
tant, it can sometimes be numb-
ing, and hearing them expressed in
several different formats can either
make you more passionate about a
certain issue or wish the contempo-
rary artist would quit whining.
Wild East at the Royal Court is
set in a job interview. A delight-
fully awkward candidate, Frank, is
being interviewed by two women.
The interview starts uncomfortably
and gives the audience a good laugh.
Then strange things begin to happen
and, as time passes, the interview
worsens and any sane human being
would have found the door and never
looked back. However, for the sake of
entertaining and passing a message
along to the audience, the interview
goes on, and on, and on.
Tom Brooke, playing Frank, does
a good job of giving the audience
the best view into the world of an
estranged nerd that wants more than
anything to catch his lucky break.
The two women, actresses Sylvestra
Le Touzel and Helen Schlesinger,
compliment each other nicely, but it
was difficult to really figure either of
them out.
Wild East is a play about corporate
mongers and the awful work they
do, about masks, personas, and how
our jobs and the success of a measly
interview can give us our soul or
take it away.
As I mentioned before, I don’t
think I have the capacity to truly
understand and appreciate mod-
ern theatre that addresses present
issues. I don’t think it’s because I
don’t want to, I think it’s because I’m
still developing my craft as a theatre
critic. It’s easier to talk about issues
from the past because they have
been addressed and analysed many
times over. But since I don’t fully
understand how I feel about issues
at hand, modern plays that com-
ment on these issues feel more like
propaganda than a different way to
look at the world around us.

Modern theatre and Hollywood
Tatum Fjerstad is unmoved by Kevin Spacey
The summer term is always a night-
mare. Between revision, exams,
projects and hayfever, it’s a wonder
we don’t all end up in a variety of
institutions by the end of term. Or
perhaps it’s just me my own terrible
hayfever and nervous disposition.
Either way, a method of relaxation is
always vital to retaining some form
of sanity, and as we all can expect,
I am going to suggest some cultural
ways to relax.
Staying with the theatre theme,
as both of the productions reviewed
above have just closed, let me sug-
gest both establishments’ new pro-
ductions.
Forthoseofyouenjoyingnewplays,
the Royal Court Theatre is definitely
the place to go. Opening on 7 May
is David Eldridge’s Incomplete and
Random Acts of Kindness, directed
by Sean Holmes. The Old Vic, on the
other hand, will be going for a classic
piece, the 1939 hit by Philip Barry,
The Philadelphia Story. Perhaps
best known in its film version star-
ring Katherine Hepburn, this run will
star Jennifer Ehle (Miss Elizabeth
Bennet in everyone’s favourite BBC
adaptation of Pride and Prejudice)
as the society girl Tracy Lord. Of
course we will also have another
chance to see the ever-present Mr
Spacey, however I’d go see it just
one the strength of casting Ehle as
Lord. Both theatres have good ticket
offers, so don’t let cost put you off,
and visit their websites for details.
One service that should not be
ignored by those of you seeking
cheap theatre or musical tickets is
the ‘tkts’ booth in Leicester Square
(just like the ones in New York). Half
price tickets are available to buy on
the day of performance from 10am
to 7pm. Their website is www.tkts.
co.uk.
The Caravaggio exhibition at the
National Gallery runs until 22 May.
Having just been to see it, I cannot
recommend it enough. This exhibi-
tion is a worthy successor to the
gallery’s recent Titian and El Greco
exhibition.
The art showcased in here is rep-
resentative of Michelangelo Merisi
da Caravaggio’s (1571 – 1610) final
years. Something of a firebrand,
Caravaggio died before reaching 40
and spent the last four years of his
life on the run from justice for a
murder in Rome. The 16 works in
the exhibition are primarily on bib-
lical themes, as is typical for the
period, all reflecting the artist’s fear
of divine justice for his crime. The
change in the artist’s mood is clearly
pointed out in the exhibition’s first
room, as both of his interpretations
of the Supper at Emmaus are avail-
able for scrutiny; with one painted in
1601 and the other in 1606, the dark-
ening of the mood and more contem-
plative style are instantly visible.
All of the works are beautifully
executed with composition and
lighting being used to their utmost.
The Flagellation (1607), The
Raising of Lazarus (1608-9), The
Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (1610),
and The Annunciation (1608-9) are,
in my opinion, the highlights of the
show. Tickets can only be bought
on the day from the box office in
the Sainsbury wing of the gallery
on Trafalgar Square. They’re £3 for
students, and during the final week
the exhibition will be open late every
day.
If live music is more appealing
to you, I cannot remind you often
enough to keep watch for the London
Philharmonic’s special student
offers (www.lpo.org.uk). Also worth
remembering is that the Proms will
soon be upon us at the Albert Hall.
The Royal Opera House has now
opened public booking for its latest
productions, as well as unveiling
next season’s programme. Possibly
following criticism received for this
year’s rather ‘greatest hits’ laden
programme, the Royal Opera will be
performing numerous less famous
works in the new season.
One last recommendation would
be Orphée in the Royal Opera
House’s smaller performance space,
the Linbury Theatre. The chamber
opera by Philip Glass will put young-
er, rising artists in leading roles and
runs from 7 May to 5 June. Tickets
are £15 for students (www.roh.org.
uk). Paola Smith
