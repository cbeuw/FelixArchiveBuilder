Einstein was right. God
doesn’t play dice with the
universe. Perhaps he plays
poker.
Our universe is governed by
laws of chance. Sub-atomic
particles, the very stuff of real-
ity, can only be measured in
terms of probabilities. Albert
Einstein famously found this
idea hard to accept. He could
not bring himself to accept
that events such as spontane-
ous radioactive decays were
truly random. He believed
that “God does not play dice
with the universe”; his meta-
physical conviction was that
there were certain hidden
variables at play.
If God doesn’t play dice with
the universe then surely he
plays poker, where there is an
element of designandchance.
It is against this cultural back-
drop, perhaps, that poker has
gone from being a fad in this
country to something resem-
bling an organised religion.
And if you were there at last
month’s UK Student Poker
Championship, you would be
forgiven for conflating poker
with religion.
The inaugural champion-
ship was highly organised
and involved 259 students
from around 35 different uni-
versity poker societies. The
game was No Limit Texas
Hold ‘Em, as featured on TV
series such as Channel 4’s
Late Night Poker. Tickets
to the event were worth £30
each, making a total prize
pool of £7,770.
The organisers, St Andrews
University Poker Society
and Betfred (who are soon
to launch an online poker
website) claimed that this
was the biggest ever tourna-
ment poker event in the UK.
Rumour had it that it was the
biggest ever in Europe.
It wasn’t hard to see why,
especially with the top prize
being a prestigious $10,000
seat at the World Series of
Poker in Las Vegas, where
there will be $50m of prize
money at stake.
A team from Imperial’s
Poker Society travelled up
to St Andrews in Scotland to
take part in the event. Adam
Latimer, Saurabh Pandya,
Robert Glasspool, Karan
Lohia and Felix science edi-
tor Darius Nikbin had quali-
fied via an Imperial satellite
tournament.
The first day was a ten hour
marathon, during which the
260 players were reduced to
30. These 30 would go on to
play for a place at the final
table on the second day. Two
out of the five Imperial play-
ers, Robert and Darius, made
it to day two – in itself an
excellent result.
Eventually, after an gruel-
ling two days of playing poker,
Rob finished in a superb 20th
position. Darius fought his
way through to the final table,
where he finished the tourna-
ment in third place overall.
To the delight of the home
fans, the eventual winner
was Calum MacNicol of St
Andrews University.
Third and 20th places were
excellent results for Imperial
PokerSoc, and with more tour-
naments this term and next
year, it looks like tournament
poker at Imperial is going
from strength to strength.
