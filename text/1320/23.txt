The Wedding Date is a Pretty
Woman remake, only this time, the
‘escort’ is male.
The movie revolves around Kat
Ellis (Debra Messing), a success-
ful career woman in New York.
However, her life is less than per-
fect. Her ex-fiancé Jeffrey (Jeremy
Sheffield) inexplicably dumped her
two years ago. Her younger half-
sister Amy (Amy Adams) is getting
married to Ed (Jack Davenport),
whose best buddy – Jeffrey – will be
the best man at the wedding.
Hence, Kat decides to hire a top-
notch male escort, Nick Mercer
(Dermot Mulroney), to pose as her
boyfriend to Amy’s wedding. She
wants to convince everyone that
she is fine despite her last relation-
ship. Being a master of his trade,
Nick has a keen understanding of
human behaviour. With his insight,
he helps her to learn to cherish
herself again.
What started as a business trans-
action soon turns into something
deeper. However, Nick finds out why
Jeffrey left her two years ago and
decides to hide the truth to avoid
hurting her. Unfortunately, the truth
is soon let out of the bag. Kat is left
feeling like a fool and her faith in
Nick is questioned.
Firstly, the love story is not con-
vincing. The first half of the movie
focuses on how pathetic Kat is, as
she allows people such as her tact-
less mother and her spoilt sister to
push her around. The second half
tries to show that she has changed
when she tells Jeffrey to leave her
alone.
It might be a failure of the script
or that Debra Messing simply needs
more acting lessons, but the sec-
ond half just fails to showcase Kat
as a feisty woman with a mind of
her own. Therefore, it is difficult to
perceive how anyone could fall for
her, unless of course Nick has an
uncanny soft spot in his heart for
damsels in distress.
Secondly, the flow of the story is
not continuous and is basically filled
with too much rubbish to tug at
your heart strings. This includes
the scene where Kat and her sister
cruise around London drunk in a
limousine after Amy’s ‘bachelorette’
party. It does not fit in with the main
theme of the story and seems like
a pathetic attempt at a ‘Promote
London’ video.
The script tries to inject some
humour into the movie by poking fun
at Kat’s insecurities. One example
would be the scene where she had
to try on dozens of dresses before
she could decide what to wear to
her sister’s wedding party. Honestly,
a fresher and more original attempt
would have been better suited to
save this film.
There are some good points about
this movie, though. It has an excel-
lent soundtrack. Next, from a female
perspective, it is perfectly under-
standable how Kat can be so riddled
by single-woman anxiety that she
was willing to pay $6000 for Nick
Mercer’s services. Plus, Dermot
Mulroney does have a talent for say-
ing trashy lines such as “I’d rather
fight with you than make love with
any other woman” and succeed in
making them sound halfway decent.
But overall, it is sad to say that
these saving graces aren’t enough
to make The Wedding Date a worth-
while watch.
An unconvincing love story

Debra Messing plays the insecure Kat Ellis in The Wedding Date
Who’s the white boy over there?
Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) hasn’t
always been the supportive dad
with his daughter Theresa’s (Zoe
Saldana) boyfriends. When she
informs him of her new boyfriend,
Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher),
from That 70s Show), who she will
be bringing back home for their 25th
anniversary party weekend, Percy
investigates the boy a little further
by doing a credit check on him.
Simon’s records come back prom-
ising with a wonderful job, good
investments and an assuring future.
Percy’s excitement level builds up
due to knowledge of the “secure”
guy and he believes that his daugh-
ter may have finally found the right
person.
Unfortunately, Simon isn’t the
Denzel Washington that Percy, who
is black, was expecting. The paper
records missed out the fact that
Simon is actually white! Not that
this would matter unless he wants
to marry Theresa, which he does.
Percy, claiming to be open-minded,
finds out that it’s just too much to
handle, knowing that his daughter is
going out with a white guy.
Guess Who is a pretty funny movie,
though I did expect to laugh a bit
more! The combination of Bernie
Mac and Ashton Kutcher brings out
the comedy side of the film. You have
the boy going to meet his future in-
laws, who is terrified at the idea of
meeting Percy. Then you have the
protective father who just doesn’t
consider any guy to be appropriate
for his daughter and wastes no time
in displaying those emotions openly.
The movie’s comedy relies on the
dialogue and not on the plot. Actually
there isn’t much of a plot anyway. It’s
all based on racial difference, which
is mainly used as humour rather
than to illustrate serious points and
learning to accept the fact that love
is indeed colourblind.
So where have we heard this story
line? Yep, Guess Who goes in the
same tracks as Meet the Parents.
However, Bernie Mac pulls off the
facial expressions much better than
De Niro did. As for Ashton Kutcher,
he doesn’t live up to Bernie’s per-
formance and it seems as though he
could have done much better if only
he stopped trying so hard. However
both characters balance out and
they end up sharing a bed, a dance
and each other’s views on love.
Add in the race bets, which involve
crashing through barriers, and you
get a more or less good comedy.
There isn’t much to say about the
other actors’ performances. The
women in the film are all strong,
independent, do not live in their
men’s reflection and have a mind of
their own, which does bring a little
refreshing difference to the normal
romantic comedy films.
Overall, this movie isn’t very
smart or all that funny, though the
message that is sent across isn’t
misread or lost. The movie shows
how far we have come and how far
we still need to go.
It is hopeless to try to review a
movie like Guess Who without men-
tioning race. After all, the film’s foun-
dations are based on the cultural
unfairness that still exists, opposing
interracial marriages. It’s basically
a romantic comedy about difficulties
in interracial relationships with mis-
matched individuals finding points
of mutual understanding.
So is this movie highly recom-
mended? Unfortunately, the answer
is no! If you are looking for a great
movie to lift your spirits up and give
you stomach cramps, due to the
exams just around the corner, this
really isn’t the one to go for, though
it can provide a few smiles. The last
thing you need is to worry about the
wasting of your time and money. So
save yourself from this pain, walk
away and, if you are interested, wait
for the DVD version.
