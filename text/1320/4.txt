Poverty could finally be history
The US and UK have taken several steps closer to providing mass debt relief for
poor countries. Numaan Chaudhry takes an objective view
Last week, the US and Britain
edged closer to an agreement
that could provide billions
of dollars in debt relief for
impoverished nations, but
they remained split over the
question of whether to pro-
vide even more new aid to
relieve global poverty.
The negotiations raised
hopes that the two nations
– who are leading the debate
among G7, the Group of Seven
major industrial powers – will
be able to settle on a develop-
ing world debt plan by the
time their leaders meet in
Scotland in July.
“We believe we can make
substantial progress in the
next few months in alleviat-
ing debts of poor countries
and increasing the resources
available for poverty reduc-
tion,” British chancellor
Gordon Brown told report-
ers after a meeting of top
economics officials from G7
nations on Saturday.
“It is now recognised for
the first time as a result of
these meetings that more
money will have to be made
available.”
Mr Brown’s claims of
progress appear overstated,
however. So far, US President
George W Bush, who faces
enormous federal deficits
and tough budget fights with
Congress, hasn’t agreed to
provide additional financial
aid for the developing world,
according to US officials.
For itspart,theBushadmin-
istration said over the week-
end that it persuaded Britain
that any effort to address the
$40bn that 33 countries owe
the World Bank and African
Development Bank must
include a complete write-off
-- not just relief from debt
payments, as the UK had pro-
posed.
Under the US plan, debt
cancellation would be
financed through World Bank
resources, not additional
funding from the US and
other wealthy nations. British
officials say the US approach
is acceptable only if it comes
with new aid resources.
Behind closed doors, the G7
finance ministers discussed
rising oil prices, slow growth
in Europe, massive US budg-
et deficits and tensions over
China’s policy of keeping its
currency artificially weak
against the dollar and euro.
Nonetheless, the ministers
from the US, Britain, France,
Italy, Germany, Japan and
Canada concluded that
“the global expansion has
remained robust and the
outlook continues to point to
solid growth for 2005”.
The finance ministers,
many of whom believe their
nations’ companies are
unfairly handicapped by the
artificially low value of the
yuan, reiterated their hope
that China would adopt a
more flexible exchange rate
system. French finance min-
ister Thierry Breton told
reporters that the ministers
considered it “clear that the
yuan is undervalued and
there was a consensus that
China has to address this”.
China keeps the yuan in a
tight range of around 8.3 to
the dollar.
US officials, under pressure
from Capitol Hill to defend
US manufacturers against
Chinese competition, have
been particularly vocal in
recent days about Beijing’s
currency practices.
US treasury secretary John
Snow took the opportunity at
the G7 meeting to repeat the
Bush administration’s line
that China has taken all of the
necessary preliminary steps
and should now relax its hold
on the yuan.
US negotiators broached
the subject of inserting sharp-
er language aimed at China
into the joint G7 statement,
but the group rejected that
idea as potentially counter-
productive. “It’s ultimately up
to China to decide, and I hope
China makes the right call,”
Japanese Finance Minister
Sadakazu Tanigaki said.
The UK, which holds the
one-year rotating presidency
of the G7, is using its position
to press for more assistance
for poor nations, particularly
in sub-Saharan Africa. The
initiative has led to months of
sparring with the US.
Prime Minister Tony Blair
faces a general election on
May 5 and has been losing
some popularity because of
his support for Mr Bush and
the war in Iraq. Mr Blair and
Mr Brown, who is considered
to have his eye on the top job
in the UK, have staked a good
deal of their personal prestige
and political fortunes on the
promise that they will come
to Africa’s rescue.
Mr Blair has called for a
doubling of aid flows from the
rich world to the poor world,
to $100bn a year. Privately,
US officials complain that
the Bush administration
isn’t getting credit for the
aid increases the president
has already put into place,
including his AIDS programs
and his signature Millennium
Challenge Account, which
is slated to provide its first
grant today, a $110m package
for Madagascar.
Despite Mr Brown’s claims
that the issue is settled, the
G7 ministers left open the
question of additional aid in
the communiqué issued at
the conclusion of their meet-
ing.
The group cited “progress”
in agreeing “to provide as
much as 100% reduction” in
debts “without reducing the
resources available to the
poorest countries through
these institutions.”
