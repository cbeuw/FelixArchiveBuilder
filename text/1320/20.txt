In a desperate bid to take
over your precious newspa-
per pages, the Fellwanderers
embarked on yet another
misadventure into the north
of our fair nation. Yes, this
meant spending nine bloody
hours on the M6 in a cramped
minibus negotiating with
other Londoners who had the
same idea.
Was it worth it? Well, on
arrival at our camping barn
we unlocked the doors to find
nothing other than two drunk-
en Geordies stinking up the
place with incessant belch-
ing and foul language. In a
desperate bid to take back
our barn, we tried to strike
a compromise in which they
could sleep downstairs if they
just let us get our stuff out and
get to sleep.
Come the morning, howev-
er, the two were friendly and
bright, offering to help us put
up some more tents before
they set off on their way.
This, of course, is a lie, seeing
as the two were still com-
pletely drunk and rather
incoherent. Feeling little
sympathy for them, our ever-
courteous president decided
to outwit them using compli-
cated words and not starting
every sentence with a four-
letter profanity in a desperate
bid to get rid of them (even-
tually the local farmer ‘took
care’ of them, in case you
were wondering).
After that incident, we set
off in search of the tallest hills
to climb and the best scen-
ery the Lake District has to
offer. While one group tested
their skills with the ice axes
on Striding Edge, the other
group walked for a good solid
eight hours up three differ-
ent mountains! Although we
had to fight off the occasional
blizzard on the summit and
the biting wind, the views
were incredible and literally
left you breathless (although
that could have been the bit-
ter cold).
Eventually, el presidente
(Sarah) managed to get us all
rounded up like so many zom-
bie sheep, into the minibus
and back to the barn, where
‘Trial by Gas Stove’ began.
For the uninitiated amongst
you, this is an ancient mythi-
cal ritual whose origins are
long forgotten (too many
bar nights I suppose). The
hand-picked sacrificial victim
spends at least half an hour
trying to insert the gas pipe
into what on closer inspection
turned out to be the air vent,
and then turns the gas on
and leaves it to gather for ten
minutes while hunting down
and cornering a lighter. As
everyone else takes cover, the
lighter is waved in the vague
direction of the stove, result-
ing in a small fireball, lots of
cursing and a distinct singed
look around the eyebrows.
Dinner was eventually
achieved (special thanks to
Sarah and Tristan for mak-
ing it not just edible, but
tasty) and it was time to ply
Soundtrack Matt with alco-
hol until he burst into song
– a sight to leave strong men
trembling and weaker souls
pleading for mercy. To the
haunting refrain of innocent
Disney songs being brutally
savaged, it was time to head
to the local tavern to get to
know some of the Welsh peo-
ple who were camping with
us before retreating to the
sleeping bags.
Sunday morning dawned
grey and overcast – perfect
weatherforalittlefreeweights
training, the weight of choice
being the Cardiff University
Outdoor Club minibus, which,
with patriotic Welsh stubborn-
ness, was refusing to cross
an English bridge. It’s amaz-
ing how fast Fellwanderers
can push a minibus when it’s
between them and the hills...
After an hour’s snooze on
the bus, all of a sudden we’d
got to the second day’s hill.
Hill? Well, it looked sort of
like a hill on the map, but our
ascent was actually up an ice-
covered rocky ridge spear-
ing ever upwards into the
clouds. However, everyone
got up intact and the views
eastwards (and straight down
either side, for that matter)
were stunning.
A last scramble over knee-
deep snow and the summit
was ours, the sun breaking
through the clouds to gen-
erate a moment of awesome
beauty, marred only by the
near-universal reflex pos-
ing, which can be viewed in
full horrifying detail at www.
fellwanderers.com. After that,
is was all over, barring the
snowball fights on the way
back down. All in all, this was
a fantastic trip. Thanks to eve-
ryone who went for making it
so good.
FELLWANDERERS
Fellwanderers take on the Lakes
...and this time it’s personal
A big lake. Beautiful isn’t it?

Leaving the union at seven on
a bitterly cold Saturday morn-
ing (is there any other kind?)
the Fellwanderers were set
to prove they could socialise
without hiking or drinking.
When we got there, it was
a challenge to see just how
many layers you could fit
under an oversized camou-
flaged jump suit without
restricting the blood supply.
Paintballing. Sounds easier
than it really is. Less pain-
ful, too.
It was a delight to see the
way everyone’s true col-
ours shone through as they
were shot at by some short
kid with a sparklingly clean
boiler suit and custom gun.
Clearly, orange trousers were
off the agenda (too much of a
target).
Our Quartermaster decided
to direct from the rear, leav-
ing our president (“I can’t
shoot so let’s just run”) to
lead our budding members
(fresh meat) to the front to
try to capture the flag, charge
a castle full of defenders and
generally get shot amongst
the giant cotton reels.
It’s amazing how little you
could see of some of our more
cautious members stalking
nearer the back.
Much fun was had by all,
and we would have done
better, too, if it weren’t for
the terrain (we don’t do flat
ground).
Acertainex-presidentdecid-
ed to take one for the team,
running towards the flag for
all of two metres before being
repeatedly gunned down by
everyone, including us (“oh,
oh, it hurts, stop, stop, I’m
dead, I’m dead”). My tip:
never leave the only thing
that distinguishes you from
the enemy behind, especially
when it’s your gun!

It’s gripped, it’s sorted... let’s paintball!
Paintballing: war has never been so much fun
