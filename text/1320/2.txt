An Imperial College ICT
manager was knocked off his
bicycle and killed by a 4x4
vehicle at around 10.20pm on
Friday 11 March.
Thomas Sippel-Dau, who
was 54, died on Cromwell
Road, near to Imperial’s
South Kensington campus.
The driver of the dark col-
oured vehicle drove away
after realising what had hap-
pened.
Arthur Spirling, Imperial’s
Deputy Director of ICT, said:
“[Thomas] seemed to have
a particular affinity with our
students and his patient and
calm approach endeared him
to many”.
On the Felix website, sever-
al students have paid tribute
to Mr Sippel-Dau, who was
originally from Germany.
Simon Clark, Computing
III, wrote: “It’s a terrible
shame. From my brief deal-
ings with Thomas, and from
reading his numerous posts
to mailing lists, he was a very
personable, very intelligent,
helpful, friendly man.”
Police have asked anyone
who may have seen the inci-
dent to contact them on 0207
259 0324 or 0800 555 111.
