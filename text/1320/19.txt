CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk
By Daniel Carrivick
Members of the Recreational
Clubs Committee (RCC) had
been up since the crack of
dawn to organise the 2005
Nighthike. Having written
and printed the necessary
documents and maps, it was
over to Amersham to set out
the course.
A few snow showers threat-
ened to hamper proceedings,
but fortunately they came to
nothing.
Thisyear’sbase,Amersham-
on-the-hill scout hut, had been
used as the base for some
Nighthike events in previous
years. However, this year’s
event was to differ from those
in the past, which had gone
south of Amersham, by head-
ing north around Chesham.
Soon after 8pm, the first
of the 25 pre-entered teams
started to arrive. Last minute
preparations were still under-
way, so some took the oppor-
tunity to visit the local for a
pint or two.
At 9.30pm, teams regis-
tered, picking up their maps
and instructions. They had to
copy down the descriptions of
where each checkpoint was
located and mark the check-
points on their map from the
grid references they’d been
given.Checkpointswereworth
different amounts of points
and teams had six hours to
collect as many points as pos-
sible, so efficient route choice
was critical.
The first team set out at
10.30pm into the dark night,
where the temperature was
already well below zero. The
last left just before midnight.
There were two different
categories: ‘novice’, for those
who weren’t very familiar with
navigation skills, and ‘compe-
tent’, for those with a little
more experience.
Novice teams had a choice
of visiting up to 15 checkpoints
in the area to the north east of
Amersham, while all 26 check-
points were up for grabs for
the competent teams. Many
competent teams elected to
head around Chesham clock-
wise, as this saw them reach
the furthest checkpoints, and
hence those worth the most
points, first.
Situated on a fence behind
a tree only a few metres
from the path, checkpoint 001
proved elusive to a number of
teams. The Incredibles, hav-
ing fought their way through
the undergrowth to where
they thought it was, had given
up on finding it and were mak-
ing their way back to the path
when they stumbled across
it!
The first team to reach the
most northerly checkpoint,
026, did so just after midnight
and were surprised to be met
by the Red Bull Energy Team
(see picture, above left). Many
competitors were energised,
which kept them mentally
focused and alert; just what
was needed to keep them
going for the rest of the night.
The muddy paths had frozen
solid, making the bridleways
treacherously uneven and
unforgiving. Unfortunately, a
person from team Run Away
twisted their ankle so badly
they were forced to withdraw
at 2.50am. They got a lift back
to the Nighthike base in one
of the patrolling minibuses,
while the team continued.
Warm drinks, along with
something that was supposed
to be soup but looked more
like wallpaper paste, awaited
the teams as they finished
back at the Nighthike base.
Most came back on time
between 4.30 and 6am, with
lessons being learned from
last year when lots of teams
arrived back late, incurring
severe penalties as a result.
Extra time was awarded for
visiting manned checkpoints
but not everyone had read the
rules and hence some teams
failed to take advantage of
this opportunity. Sausage and
egg sandwiches were served
while results were compiled
and we waited for the final
team, The Stumblers, to fin-
ish. They finally ran in, slight-
ly out of breath, at 6.34am,
having collected the most
points (940 out of 1000) but
in the end they finished the
novice category in second
place with 760 points as they
were 31 minutes late. Winners
of the novice category were
The Lost Spaghettis with 834
points.
In the competent cat-
egory, third place went to
The Incredibles, who got
830 points (also out of 1000),
and in second place, visit-
ing 22 checkpoints and gain-
ing 875 points, was Special
Brew Crew. Visiting the same
number of checkpoints, but
with 890 points, were the win-
ners, Smoffat, who took home
the ‘most competent compe-
tent’ Nighthike team award.
Of course, there were other
prizes, including the ‘shin-
ing beacon’ award that tra-
ditionally goes to the person
with the biggest, brightest
torch but which this year was
awarded to the person with
the brightest trousers – they
were an eye-dazzling fluo-
rescent orange (see picture,
above right).
Naturally, wooden spoons
were up for grabs too, and
these fiercely contested
awards ended up going to
The Team and The Hopeless
Hikers for being the ‘most
novice novice team’ and the
‘most incompetent competent
team’ respectively.
By 7.30am it was all over
for another year, and the par-
ticipants headed home for a
well-earned sleep. It wasn’t
so easy for the organisers
though – the hut had to be
cleared and cleaned, and then
all the checkpoints collected
in. However, in our fatigued
state, all the maps had been
sent back to London in a min-
ibus, so we had to rely on
our exhausted memories as
to where the checkpoints
were. In the end we managed
it, though we couldn’t have
done it without the Red Bull
– thanks girls!
Special thanks must also go
to Nick and Phil for helping
me organise this years event,
Chris and Adam for driv-
ing minibuses and manning
checkpoints, and Seb and Olle
for standing in and helping to
man the kitchen. Also thank
you to the eighty-odd com-
petitors who took part. I hope
you had a good time and hope
to see you again next year.
