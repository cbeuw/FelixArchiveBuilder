rematch was inevitable.
We were buoyed by our
previous success, and the
knowledge that winning this
game would guarantee us
second place and a spot at
the Student Outdoor National
Championships.
Cambridge were slightly
short on numbers, and after
being worn down by some
long early points, resorted
to playing a zone against us
when we were 6-2 up.
Faultless handling by Boon,
solid popping by Yoong, a few
committed layout O’s from
Steve-O and some top side-
line support from our friends
on the KCL Ultimate team
allowed us to deal with their
zone easily.
Lewis walked into the zone
for a score from a short pass
by Magic towards the end of
the game, and we managed to
reach the 15-point cap before
the time deadline.
dD2 MATCH REPORTS

(Royal Holloway) 10
The weather was fantastic for
the first game as dD2 hud-
dled together for a team talk
and “peanut power” call. dD2
captain Ian (Munky) had won
the toss, breaking the Disc
Doctor curse of losing it.
At the start of the match,
dD2 lacked a bit of flow and
Hammers had no prob-
lem grinding our offence to
halt. Always one step ahead,
Holloway used their height
advantage to throw a number
of deep overheads, which dD2
struggled to stop.
By the time dD2 had redis-
covered their funky rhythm, it
was a little too late. They had
held Holloway off well and
were the only team to not be
beaten by the 13-point cap of
the first game.
dD2 2
Strange Blue1
(Cambridge) 13
This game was likely to have
been dD2’s hardest match
up. Strange Blue, the sec-
ond seeds, had a reputation
of being a consistent team,
never short of Ultimate talent
(pun intended).
As predicted, Cambridge
started the scoring, again tak-
ing advantage of dD2’s lack
of deep players. dD2 kept
SB on their toes with quick
cuts out of the stack, allowing
them to move the disc upfield
quickly. Towards the end, dD2
changed their playing style:
Munky tried some more long
upfields to Stas who got a few
but who was beaten in the
air by some of the taller SB
players.
Thanks to some sweet cut-
ting by Snazzy, Mary and
George, dD2 managed to
score two points against a
very sporting Strange Blue
team.

Strange Blue2

In the next ‘Battle of the 2nds’,
dD2 took on a very deter-
mined Strange Blue2. Eager
to show their strength, SB2
worked quickly to score the
first three points of the game,
but dD2, who were deter-
mined to stop them, brought
back the score to 6-4.
dD2 attempted to break
the constant SB2 line force
with some ‘dump and swing’
tactics, whilst simultaneously
playing their own line force.
Hats off to Denim and
Snazzy who caught some very
high discs with hands safer
than an international crick-
eter. Unfortunately Strange
Blue 2 walked away with the
win, but dD2 felt they had
played a lot better during this
match.
Surrey Scorpions 6
dD2 5
This was last pool game of the
day, and dD2 were shocked to
see Cedric who had turned up
around half a day late! Still,
better than never.
The team made Cedric
run hard as punishment for
sleeping all morning, as dD2
attempted to wear-out an Iron
man team of Scorpions.
The Doctors found them-
selves in a good position
early on, scoring the first few
points. With the sun glaring
down all day, playing was
tough, but thanks to great
handling by Toby dD2 flew
upfield quicker than Jo was
getting sunburnt.
Despite Jay lying by the
sideline showing his support
for dD2, the guys (and girls)
began losing their lead over
Surrey. A few unlucky turn-
overs left both teams fight-
ing for the match at 5-5 after
time. dD2 had a very good
opportunity to win, but didn’t
manage to stop Surrey from
getting the final point. It was
a close match indeed, both
teams fought well, and the
score could have gone either
way.
Since dD2 had retained
their original seed in the pool,
they were put into a three-
way round-robin on the sec-
ond day with Aye Aye2 and
Holloway Hammers2.
After losing all their pool
matches, the only way for
dD2 was up! Well, they could
have gone down further, but
were determined to win,
inspired by the progress of
the first team. Despite los-
ing Finnish, Toby and Cedric
on the Sunday, dD2 still had
a good roster of enthusiastic
players, ready to take on Aye
Aye2.

Aye Aye2 (UEA,
Norwich) 4
The Aye Aye bunch are
renowned for being a very
spirited team. They are regu-
larly found singing songs and
chanting, up until the point
that everyone within about a
2km radius is about to beat
them to the ground with their
frisbees. They sang this one
song about how “Will is the
captain of their ship” and how
“their ship is a tanker and
Will is a...” well, you get the
idea.
dD2 got off to a good start,
forcing sideline and trapping
Aye Aye play. Aye Aye made
quite a few mistakes, allowing
dD2 to send the disc up field
to Lisa and Stas, who worked
hard to get to some of the
longer throws.
Withafewpointsundertheir
belt, dD2 decided to throw a
zone. The ‘junk’ caught Aye
Aye 2 off guard and it took
them a while to get used to
it. By this time dD2 had the
match well under control and
were working very well as a
team, even playing calls of
‘Princes Gardens’, where the
last player would run deep for
a long overhead.
It was a fun match to play.
Both teams were friendly
towards each other and eve-
ryone had a laugh at the end,
playing a game that involved
slapping each other on the
ass... cheeky.

Hammers2
(Royal Holloway) 2
It did seem that all the way
out on pitch 6, the number
of spectators had more than
quadrupled as Holloway
Hammers2 brought along all
their support with them.
dD2 still had a full, uninjured
team (apart from Snazzy who
had received a mild case of
‘disc in the groin’. Luckily it
wasn’t terminal).
The Disc Doctors fought
well against the home team
advantage. They played a
number of zone variations
and Munky even managed a
point block whilst chasing!
Hammers2 tried playing a
lot of long overheads, whilst
handling with their bigger
players.
Luckily dD2 had it all cov-
ered and turnovers were
quick. Skilled handling from
Jo and Denim combined with
great play from G and Mary in
the middle kept Disc Doctors
ahead.
At full time, Disc Doctors
2 had proved themselves as
one of the best 2nd teams in
the region. Overall they had
finished just behind Strange
Blue 2 in the table.
This commendable achieve-
ment was thanks to every
player on the team, all of
whom had worked hard for
it. All the players had really
enjoyed the weekend and
the experience had clearly
improved everyone’s game.
Summary
Thanks go out to both dD1
and dD2 for playing their
guts out at the tournament.
Everyone walked away with
huge smiles on their faces
and right now as dD1 prepare
to go to the nationals, the
whole team is just as eager
to succeed as before. Don’t
forget to watch this space!
