Ladies and gentlemen,
Secrets make the world go round.
No, not that cheap lap-dancing chain,
where chavess after chavess tries
and fails to get my attention onto
the perma-tanned acne collection
that masquerades for a face. Those
things you disclose, those things you
hide from others – secrets are the
very reason other people are inquis-
itive. Good things, let me tell you.
Welcome to a final term of dec-
adence and debauchery, in which
I, Stormy Woods, aspire to usurp
the dizzying heights I’ve previously
reached in my quest to enjoy life to
the max.
Final term, eh? Isn’t that when
you’re supposed to be on a caffeinat-
ed diet in 24-hour library conditions
whilst attempting to get that vital
2.1 passport to Merrill Lynch and
similarly prestigious wanker banker
firms? Sadly not, dear readers, for I
am a fourth year of the witchdoctory
faculty, in my BSc year, cruising
through my final term of freedom
before wards, exemplary behaviour
and trying to flirt my way through
placements become things of the
present for me.
So what will this term bring to the
eternally pervy Stormy? Perhaps
I’ll get to enjoy some exotic males
from far flung countries, the Latino-
heat kinda thing? I might even get
to emulate this Spring’s couture
with an African tribal-inspired con-
sort. My friend and I know that
those international students have
an impressive array of bedroom
customs we’re yet to experience
in the sack. It’s looking increas-
ingly likely that they shall impress
– the Kama Sutra didn’t originate in
England!
Racist stereotypes aside – stere-
otypes of which I myself have been
the unfortunate victim when a chap
asked me to be more subservient,
since that’s what Asian girls did
(needless to say, he ended up in
A&E with testicular torsion) – I’ve
not been especially inspired with
regards to matters of the pants.
There have been a couple of inter-
lopers – one of whom was hideous to
the point where he had to be kissed
with the lights off at night, and the
other so attractive I practically
came on looking at him. The Stormy
paradox has been set: the uglier the
guy, the better he is in bed.
Ugly guy was courteous, consider-
ate, willing to learn and, most impor-
tantly, willing to compromise and
try new things. The handsome chap
was selfish, unadventurous, pat-
ronising, hurtful and presumptious,
assuming I’d like everything that
the last six million girls he’d been to
bed with liked. Each and every man
and woman is different, and I cannot
stress exactly how considerate it is
to ask your bed partners how you’re
doing and whether there’s anything
they’d like you to do. Satisfied peo-
ple are often happy people – and if
it wasn’t for ugly guy’s inability to
eat with his mouth closed and the
rest of his hygenically-challenged
lifestyle, Stormy Woods would have
a boyfriend.
Caveats are always interesting,
aren’t they? How would... what if...
if he didn’t... life would be different,
I guess, and so would I. If I didn’t
meet the Shreddie at Retribution, I
might not have developed the never-
ending white rasta-look obsession. If
I didn’t stalk the very same Shreddie
at college, I’d never have come
across and had the time of my life
with ugly guy. These things are cir-
cumrotary. I could be married with
children in Bangladesh by now.
But I’m not. And I’m bloody grate-
ful for not having to do a Jemima
Khan and miss out on a glitter-
ing social life in my prime whilst
attempting to find myself amongst
the luxury mansions in Lahore.
Jemima looks so dated. I wish she’d
use her considerable fortune to buy
herself a wardrobe befitting of a
princess; she’s got a lovely figure,
and stunning features, which seem
to be swamped by her ridiculous
Aslan-type mane.
I also reckon a few women above
their stations at College need
Stormy makeovers too, starting
with a female union worker regu-
larly ridiculed for her permanently
miserable face complete with over-
sized hair. Eww, don’t make me
sick. Pervy thoughts, think pervy
thoughts. Nathan Constance. Yum.
And yum is where I’ll end this
entry. Yum-lick man. The human
pug, as he’s more affectionately
known by women who can’t help
but fancy him thanks to his scraw-
ny figure and defenceless puppy-
dog eyes. Inspiration to ugly guys
everywhere, yum-lick man has
proved you don’t need looks or a
stunning personality to get the goth
scene’s version of Carmen Electra
worshipping at your bruised feet.
You just need a fetish that both
yourself and your object of affection
click with.
In his case, it’s slavery – he does
what she says, and enjoys it – in
both the carnal and real life form.
She (about whom I shall not reveal
any more details) loves the control
she experiences on telling him to
kneel before her as she is his mas-
ter. Riveting stuff for those aware of
these relationship dynamics, let me
tell you. I’m not actually supposed
to know what’s going on, but voyeur-
ism is so much more fun when you
know everybody’s little secret.
The girl about town
by STORMY WOODS
Well, analysing Imperial and not
mentioning the nerd community
would be a glaring omission (like not
connecting Einstein with E=mc2
).
So, this week, I will try to focus on
the following topics:
1. What is a nerd?
2. What kind of nerds are there?
3. How do you know you’re a nerd?
4. You’re a nerd. Now what?
1. What is a nerd?
‘Nerd’ probably comes from the
Latin word ‘nerdus’ – one who, when
he dies and looks back on his life,
sees nothing. But there are more
things beyond this simple word.
There’s a whole universe to explore:
a geeky underworld.
We all know how they look (glasses
like Dexter’s, pen in their unwashed
1970s shirt pocket, laptop/PDA suit-
case under their left arm, 848 books
under their right arm, pictures of
their favourite lecturer’s sons in
their wallets), so I won’t waste your
time with that.
If you have no clue about their
appearence, just stop reading this
article (if you have a sad enough life
to be wasting it with lousy columns),
raise your head and look around.
You see? Wherever you might be
(Junior Common Room, Main
Dinning Hall, the computer room in
your department or a picnic towel
in Hyde Park) you are surrounded
by them. Yes, all those strange eyes
looking at you like they disapprove
of your laid back attitude are those
of N-E-R-D-S.
Unfortunately, as you noticed, they
are not extinct, even after all the
hard work of anti-nerd movements.
They are stronger than cockroaches
(and believe me, cockroaches have
survived major natural catastro-
phes – from the dinosaurs’ extintion
to the re-election of George W Bush)
and are hard to exterminate.
2. What kinds of nerds are
there?
• Front row nerd – sits in the front
row and smiles at the lecturer while
taking notes with five different col-
oured pens of every-bloody-thing he
says in a perfectly organized note-
book. Always arrives 15 minutes
early for optimal viewing position in
the lecture theatre.
• Arse-licking nerd – an evolu-
tion of the front row nerd. Has the
improved ability to melt even the
coldest lecturer’s heart with sym-
pathy, offers to help him with his
research (even if that means losing
three hours of study a day) and
makes geeky jokes about physics
and maths. Always tries to approach
the teacher when the lecture fin-
ishes, even if that means grabbing
someone by the neck.
• Rebel nerd – a nerd trying to get
a more normal life (and by that I
mean going out of his room to buy
some bread or, eventually, waste his
time with music). Sometimes, tries
to do something outrageous and
only hands in the coursework five
days before the deadline or drinks
coke without taking all the gas bub-
bles off.
• Nerd wannabe – a bad student
that wants to raise his Third to a 2.2
degree and so starts imitating front
row or arse-licking nerds. Lacks
quality and years of experience,
though.
• Nerd converter – wants to bring
even more people to his religion
(geekianism) by: a) inviting them to
join his workgroups, b) letting them
copy a third of his homework, c)
not ordering all the books from the
library (unless he’s desperate).
• Nerd leader – he talks, they follow.
He’s THE NERD. Like male lions
and red iguanas, there can only be
one in each classroom. He leads all
the other nerds through their boring
university lives.
• LAN parties nerd – this is a dif-
ferent breed - most of them are bad
students! You cannot separate LAN
nerd from his most loved treasure:
his laptop. Usually spends Friday
and Saturday nights (or even the
whole week) playing LAN games
with his fellow nerds.
3. How do you know you’re a
nerd?
If you’re reading this article, you are
either:
a) an Imperial College student
b) an Imperial College lecturer not
caring about his research
c) an Imperial College student’s or
lecturer’s friend
d) an Imperial College student or
lecturer’s parent.
So... I’m sorry to inform you, but
you are probably a nerd! And in case
(d), it’s your genes’ fault!
Don’t you agree? Well, think about
your life and if you answer YES to
any of the following questions, jump
immediately to part 4.
• Have you ever had a LAN party?
• Have you ever spent a Friday or
Saturday night studying?
• Do you study for more than 45
minutes a day?
• Do you not give a crap about what
you’re wearing?
• Do you have names for your com-
puter or calculator?
• Did you break up with your last
girlfriend because “I can’t have a
girlfriend and do this course at the
same time”?
• Do you only see your friends when
you go to the computer room?
• Have you ever had more than
one meal at the college in the same
day?
• Did you go to Dixon’s or any other
hi-tech shop the last time you left
your room?
• Have you never watched a football
game or a teen movie?
• Have you never got slightly tipsy?
• Is your favourite pet called Frodo
or Heisenberg?
• Do you have trouble tying your
shoe laces?
4. You’re a nerd. Now what?
Make the world a better place and
please stop spreading your genes!
