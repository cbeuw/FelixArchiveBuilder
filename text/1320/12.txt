Free preview screening
A radical departure from con-
vention, this film demands a
freedomofviewandgreatness
of thought so far unknown.
The protagonist, Amanda,
played by Marlee Matlin, finds
herself in a fantastic Alice In
Wonderland experience when
her daily, uninspired life liter-
ally begins to unravel, reveal-
ing the uncertain world of the
quantum field hidden behind
what we consider to be our
normal, waking reality.
