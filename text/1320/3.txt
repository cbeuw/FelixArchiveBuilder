After nine months in prison,
an Imperial College alumnus
should finally discover wheth-
er he will be extradited to the
United States when a judge
gives his ruling on 17 May.
Babar Ahmad, who stud-
ied engineering and went on
to work in ICT at Imperial,
stands accused of acts of ter-
rorismincludingrunningweb-
sites for terror organisations
in Chechnya and Afghanistan.
Though he has not been
convicted of any offence, he
remains in custody due to the
gravity of the allegations and
the supposed risk of contin-
ued terrorist activity.
Around 500 people pro-
tested outside Bow Street
Magistrates Court on 18 April
as the latest chapter of his
extradition hearing began.
Around 20 Imperial College
students were present.
Protestors used megaphones,
banners and balloons to make
their message clear, accusing
George Bush, Tony Blair and
the police of being “the real
terrorists”.
MrAhmad,30,couldbecome
the first British citizen to
be extradited to the United
States under the Extradition
Act 2003, which does not allow
him the chance to respond
to the allegations made by
the US government. He was
first arrested in December
2003, but was released by the
British authorities without
charge. He was rearrested
in August 2004 and has been
in prison awaiting extradition
ever since.
Writing for Felix in January,
Mr Ahmad said: “I know, and
God knows, that I am not a
terrorist and that I have not
done anything wrong or ille-
gal. That is what matters to
me more than what others
think. And I will have my day,
for sure, no doubt about it.”
Speakers outside the court
included Martin Mubanga and
Moazzam Begg, both of whom
were imprisoned under terror
laws and recently released.
Mr Mubanga gave an emo-
tional description of his time
as a detainee at Guantanamo
Bay, adding that Mr Ahmad
could also finish up there if
lawyers and governments
made the “wrong” choices.
Dr Adnan Siddiqui, a
spokesman for ‘Stop Political
Terror’, spent part of the day
in court before coming out-
side to address Mr Ahmad’s
supporters. “It’s been quite
harrowing listening to what’s
happening,” he said.
“Butiftheyextraditehim,do
you think they can extradite
all of us? No! That’s the mes-
sage we have to put across:
we will not be silenced. We
are standing up for the truth,
and we expect our leaders to
stand up for the truth. But
they have given up on the
truth, so now it is time for the
people to take over.”
Colin Smith, Imperial
College Union’s Welfare
Campaigns Officer, led the
demonstration outside the
court. He told Felix: “Once
again it was fantastic to see
such a large demo in support
of Babar. As we get closer to
judgement day, it is vital that
we continue with the cam-
paign.
“Continued resistance to
what is being done to Babar
can’t fail to have an influence
on this case, which is why
I would encourage everyone
to be back at Bow Street
Magistrates Court on 17 May
when the judge will rule on
Babar’s fate.”
Last Wednesday, it was
announced that Mr Ahmad
will stand as a candidate in
the forthcoming general elec-
tion. He will represent the
Peace and Progress Party
in the constituency of Brent
North. The party, founded by
the actors Vanessa and Corin
Redgrave, focuses on human
rights and is campaigning
for British troops to be with-
drawn from Iraq.
A statement from Mr
Ahmad’s election agent read:
“Babar firmly believes that
civil rights and liberties have
been sacrificed in Britain in
an attempt to create a climate
of fear among the population.
Voting for Babar symbolises
the British public’s oppo-
sition to this suspension of
civil rights, which millions of
British men and women sac-
rificed their lives for over 50
years ago.”

Have a slice, there’s plenty to go around...
Sir Richard Sykes, the
Rector, cuts himself a slice
of Imperial’s largest ever
pizza, which was unveiled
in the JCR at the end of
last term. The event was
organised by engineering
student Saurabh Dhoot
as a celebration of Italian
manufacturing, and the
4m long pizza was eaten
in just 20 minutes. It was
sponsored by Videocon
Group, India’s largest
electronics conglomerate
