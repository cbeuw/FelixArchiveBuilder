The idea I had was to go out every
night over the weekend and make a
diary of where I went.
I needed someone else to come
along, so off I went trying to find one
of my friends who was willing to do
the whole thing. That’s when I real-
ised that not many people want to
completely abuse their bodies.
A lot of friends were up for it until
they heard what would be happen-
ing, then they told me to stop being
stupid – apparently you need sleep,
don’t you know? Anyway I asked my
friend Mike, who agreed. He doesn’t
like his course much anyway and
didn’t care about being off his face
for the whole weekend.
The plan was to start on Thursday
and go out every night of the week-
end. We also had to go to every lec-
ture and practical. I don’t think my
lab partner appreciated me turning
up and not being able to focus prop-
erly. So where did we go?
THURSDAY
As this was our first night, we didn’t
want to burn out, so we decided to
take it easy until we arrived.
Did you know if you get to The
End before 11.30pm drinks are
really cheap? When I say cheap, I
mean ridiculously cheap – £1.60 for
a house spirit and mixer. How good
is that? We arrived at about 11.15,
as we knew the door guy would be a
twat as they always are, so we only
had 15 minutes to drink as much as
we could afford from the cheap bar.
We ended up buying mini bottles
of champagne. Why? I don’t know,
but it seemed like a good idea at
the time.
The End has two rooms. One was
house and the other was urban/
R&B. This room I avoided the whole
night – there is something slightly
unsavoury about all those Urbanite
pop-tangled groups. I mean, who
calls themselves ‘snoop-bitching-ho
gunna bust a cap in your ass’ any-
way? I’m sure that’s what those
crazy kids were saying on the street.
Or is it hood?
Anyway, the main room started off
with the usual generic safe funky
house to get people in the mood,
which happened very quickly I
might add. Then, as the evening pro-
gressed, it became a bit more pro-
gressive before slamming straight
back into proper disco house with
no warning. There were the clas-
sics which everyone who goes to
house nights will know, and they
were the actual originals, not those
crappy remixes that are around at
the moment (I’m not mentioning
anything in particular, except that
Freeloaders’ So Much Love to Give
is a crime and I hope they die a hor-
rible, painful death).
Ok, to the crowd: When we arrived,
we were greeted by a group of ran-
dom Orientals thrashing in front of
the speakers. It was quite chilled
at that point, but they seemed like
they were having fun. If you don’t
like seeing people on drugs in a club
I wouldn’t go to Discotec, but then
again, I would never bother going
to a club at all but would sit at home
with my Horlicks and my many cats
and then shout at the plant in the
corner.
Discotec is an attitude-free night.
This means that it doesn’t matter
who you are, who you like to sleep
with or what drugs you like to take,
people aren’t going to bat an eye to
it. This provides a nice atmosphere,
giving the whole night a kind of fun
and easiness.
As this is the case, Discotec
attracts a range of people. It was
about 50:50 on the guy-to-girl ratio
and about 70:30 gay to straight, but
the big homos are raging queens
like in GAY so it was all pretty nor-
mal. Well, kind of. Oh yeah, Mike
and I had a great time as was to be
expected. We met a very attractive
lesbian who took her top off and was
dancing around in her bra for a bit,
which was nice. They also had an
entertainer, who had this amazing
ability to dance in the highest shoes
I’ve ever seen.
We left at about 3am – we thought
we should get an early as we had a
9am lecture.
Neighbourhood is a great venue for
performances – it has a stage and
the balcony stretches right around
the top of the room giving a per-
fect view of the stage to everyone.
Getting in was no problem at all,
as we arrived within an hour of the
doors opening, but the place was
already pretty busy.
As we arrived, we were greeted
with free shots of cocktail, which
was nice. If you like non-vocal elec-
tro this was perfect, though I like my
vocals in most types of music.
The drinks in Neighbourhood
are unnecessarily expensive and
the staff don’t seem as though they
want to be there, which is quite
clear when you order your drink.
We didn’t stay for a huge amount of
time as we had to get to Café de
Paris by midnight.
The mixing was impeccable the
whole time and the crowd had an
amazing time. The whole night was
very gig-like, from the attitude of
the crowd to the way they were
dressed. Everyone was chilled out
and comfortable, they were there
for the music. When we left, the
queue was stretching right around
the building.
Mike and I arrived at Café de Paris
at about 12 midnight, only to be
greeted by a bouncer who was tell-
ing guys they couldn’t come into
the club unless they were with at
least one girl. Luckily we snuck past
and got in after a small amount of
hassle from the guest list guy, who
was being harassed by two over-
enhanced bleached bimbos.
We were fortunate enough to get
an interview with the promoter of
the club, who gave us a tour around
the place and spoke to us about the
club and the crowd they try to pull.
From the chat, the most relevant
thing was that they are planning
to start a student night. Not a Café
de Paris style student night, but a
proper one with cheap drinks and
party games.
Something that became very clear
from the night was that people,
mostly guys, were there to show off
and try to make themselves out to
be something special. As Mike put it,
they had sold their personality to the
devil to get into the club. He wasn’t
joking. There was no-one having
a great time, just lots of preten-
tious wank. I wouldn’t go back there
again if I wasn’t getting in for free,
because I sure as hell wouldn’t pay
to be given that much attitude on a
night out.
Watching a hen party go on the pull
was the one source of amusement in
the short period of time we spent
there (we left at about 1.30am).
Unfortunately, Café de Paris was
over-priced and full of tossers, with
bad music and a bad attitude to
match.
SATURDAY
First thing’s first, a quick run-down
on how I felt. Having been out two
nights already I was feeling a bit
tired, mainly because I had to get up
early both days, but I was generally
in good spirits.
Garlands is a club in Liverpool,
which isn’t that difficult to get to
with the wonder of the Megabus – £4
each way per person. It did take five
hours though.
We arrived in Liverpool at about
four in the afternoon. The further
north we got, the darker it became.
I knew the north was grim, but to
actually watch the sky get dark-
er was ridiculous. We all joke that
the north is cheaper than London,
but it’s not even funny – we went
and got two alcoholic drinks as we
arrived and they came to about £3
in total. Can you imagine doing that
in London?
We spent our evening just poncing
about, going from bar to bar, eating
and drinking until about nine. As we
were going home the next day, we
didn’t stay anywhere and the plan
was to just stay awake, so when it
came to getting ready to go out this
had to be done in the toilets of a bar.
I don’t think they see such goings on
very often up there.
We headed over to Garlands at
about 10.30 to ensure there were no
problems getting in. The queue was
building up before the doors even
opened. For those of you who don’t
know Garlands, it is the Studio 54 of
our time in England. Have a look at
their website, www.garlandsonline.
co.uk, and you will know what I
mean.
Every week has a different theme
– when we went it was rollers and
tabards. Think Thora Hird from
Last of the Summer Wine.
Garlands is the gayest gay club
in the world, but it attracts a huge
straight following. This is probably
because they focus on making the
night an amazing experience for
everyone rather than trying to pull
in the big names. Yet somehow they
do this as well. If you like your hard
house, Garlands is a great place to
go in Liverpool. They quite regularly
pull in the likes of Fergie and Judge
Jules, to name a couple.
To try to describe Garlands is one
of the hardest things to do, I would
just say go and see for yourself, or
look at some pictures – I think they
speak for themselves. The drinks in
the club are no different to a normal
bar in London, so you won’t feel like
you have been ripped off.
I know this is a bit of a pants
review but I have just got home and,
at the end of my weekend, am quite
incapable of talking (see my photo at
the top, and no I don’t sell crack).
Clubbing. All weekend
