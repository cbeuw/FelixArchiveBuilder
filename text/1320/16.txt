The Chinese consider the
number 8 to be lucky, so I’m
told. My own personal opinion
is that they must be having a
laugh at my expense – during
the preparation of this article,
we forgot to take the photos,
I forgot to write the article,
I lost the fire extinguisher
for a few days (how do you
lose a bright red fire extin-
guisher in a small cupboard?)
and I nearly poured paraffin
all over my feet. Which just
goes to show that the ancient
Chinese can’t have been that
smart after all.
The devil stick is one of
the finer Chinese inventions
(after such inconsequential
things as gunpowder, paper
and the decimal system),
consisting of a pair of hand-
sticks and a short ‘centre’
stick. When European mis-
sionaries went to Asia, they
took the idea back home with
them, and since they couldn’t
pronounce ‘Hua Kun’ prop-
erly, they named it ‘devil stick’
instead.
First thing’s first: fire safe-
ty. Don’t wear artificial fibres,
and always have a fire extin-
guisher nearby [see picture
1]. You should also bring a
fire blanket and a friend. The
friend is very important, since
they will tell you that the arti-
ficial fibres you’re wearing
look crap. As usual, nobody
is responsible for your burns
other than yourself – if you
don’t think you can handle the
devil stick competently and
safely, don’t pick it up.
Start in the position in pic-
ture 2, without the stick on
fire to start with – since you’re
about to let one end drop, it
would make sense to check
whether you can keep the
stick in the air before you set
fire to your toes. The position
of the handsticks is important
– they should be about four
inches from the end of the
devil stick.
OK, now let one end drop
[see picture 3]. There will
be a brief moment of panic
as a ball of fire travels past
your genitals, during which
you wait until it is at about
45 degrees before you gently
‘throw’ the devil stick across
to the other handstick. Once
it’s there, catch it on the other
handstick then throw it back.
Pause a second to laugh in
the face of both gravity and
death, before trying some-
thing more tricky.
To get into a horizontal spin,
start from the position above,
but every time you catch and
throw with your right hand,
push the devil stick a little bit
forward, and with your left
hand, push a little bit towards
you. After a while, the stick
will level out and spin hori-
zontally [see picture 4].
Alternatively you can throw
it under your leg. Lift your leg
in the same way as a dog at a
fire hydrant, place your hand-
stick under the leg and tap
the devil stick as before [see
picture 5]. Observant readers
will no doubt be aware that
this is similar to the top secret
handshake of the masons – try
it on a suspected mason when
you next meet one.
That’s all there is to it.
There’s no shortage of other
tricks you can try, and if you
fancy a go at fire juggling,
diabolo, devil stick, poi and
so on, all in the (relative)
safety of Beit Quad, then
you can come to juggling on
Tuesdays from 6pm. Email
