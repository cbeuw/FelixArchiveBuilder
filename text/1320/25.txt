Preamble
To many people, 18 March
2005 was a significant date.
It signified the end of term
and a time to celebrate and
pass out on a seedy London
street due to excessive alco-
hol consumption. But for the
Imperial College Ultimate
Frisbee team, the Disc
Doctors, it marked the start
of the South East Student
Outdoor Regionals.
Now for a little background.
There are two main student
events on the Disc Doctors’
ultimate calendar: South East
Indoor Regionals and South
East Outdoor Regionals.
Qualifying in the top three
for both would put the team
into the national indoor and
outdoor event.
Unfortunately the team
didn’t qualify for the indoor
nationals this year. We like
to blame it on the fact that
we haven’t played as much
indoors as we have out-
doors! So South East Student
Outdoor Regionals was to be
the big one.
The Disc Doctors (dD) had
been training hard in Hyde
Park every Wednesday and
Saturday in sub-zero temper-
atures, and even snow, build-
ing up to this tournament.
So, as the guys got aboard
the train to Royal Holloway
ready for a weekend of “disc
action”, it was hard to predict
what would come next.
The ‘Ultimate mini book of
mumbo jumbo frisbee jargon’
(see grey panel, right) may be
useful in reading the reports
that follow!
dD1 MATCH REPORTS
dD1 13
Sublime2 (Portsmouth) 0
Our first game is never our
best, so the first team were
relieved to find we didn’t have
a crunch match to start the
day.
We soon gained a com-
fortable lead after forcing
Sublime’s handlers to make
some tricky throws under the
pressure of our junk zone.
Sublime’s handlers were
learning, towards the end,
how to get around our junk,
and use hammers to get over
our wall. Nathan has asked
me to say that he played
superbly in this game.
dD1 8
UCLSE (London) 5
UCL and LSE didn’t have
enough players to form two
separate teams, so they were
allowed to combine to form
the considerably stronger
‘UCLSE’.
We managed gain a bit of
a lead at the start, thanks
to some good play from,
amongst others, our new ris-
ing star Sui.
Things started looking
very unsettling when UCLSE
managed to take advantage
of dD’s unusually weak deep
marking. They took advan-
tage of several turnovers by
using quick hucks and some
zippy receivers. Our oppo-
nents levelled the game at
5-5, but dD managed to cut
down on the throwaways and
eventually win.

Aye Aye2 (Norwich) 0
Aye Aye 2, from the University
of East Anglia, were short on
numbers, and the effect of
the earlier games in the gor-
geous weather showed from
the beginning.
Towards the end, Aye
Aye2, realising all was lost,
pulled out a play called the
‘Braveheart’. This play
involved Aye Aye waiting in
their zone and then charging
down dD with cries of “free-
dom!” when we approached,
to scare us or simply surprise
us and make us laugh uncon-
trollably.
The tactic worked, Aye
Aye got the disc and almost
scored. We struck back with
the ‘cup-o-saurus’ play.

Brunel (London) 5
This game was the first of
what was to be a series of
stunning dD1 performances
over the weekend. dD1 rose
to the challenge of playing,
arguably, the best team in the
South East this year. I cannot
begin to tell you all the nota-
ble performances that were
part of the best team play I’ve
seen from Imperial in 2004-5.
Brunel were without their
main man Malcolm on the
day, so dD took advantage of
their lack of handling depth.
Brunel’s Dan tried his hard-
est but their deep threat
was neutralised by a com-
bination of K-man, Stylish,
and the good luck invoked
by Jay deciding to ditch his
tracksuit bottoms and wear
shorts, thereby allowing our
handlers to work their way up
the pitch.
There were tense moments
towards the end when Brunel
managed to claw back sev-
eral points, but our early lead,
and resurgence in the last ten
minutes, sealed a very satis-
fying victory.

Strange Blue1
(Cambridge) 12
This game was, in some
senses, the most exciting
and most disappointing of the
weekend. Lewis had joined
us for the day, we were on
a high from the day before,
and thanks to three-pint-chal-
lenge-free party the night
before, none of us were feel-
ing rough.
This game showed that dD
had great potential, but far too
many drops and throwaways
were made. Our junk zone
wasn’t working very well, but
a transition to the ‘brownie
zone’ caused an impressive
dD fightback which was,
unfortunately, too late.
Highlights included a
huck from Lewis, which a
Cambridge player blocked
but didn’t catch. K-man neatly
caught the still-flying disc,
and then threw to Steve-O for
a stunning point. K-man also
scored the first ever Callahan
Point of the tournament, a
first for dD, and even Magic
managed to score.

Sublime1 (Portsmouth) 5
Last year we got utterly
spanked by Sublime. We
honestly didn’t know what to
expect this time round, espe-
cially with ex-Sublime player
Lewis now on our side.
It was a pretty charged,
physical game. Sublime were
laying out everywhere like
deranged ultimate frisbee-
playing penguins. Neville did
well to hold onto the disc for
a score when two Sublime
players laid out on him, in
a hopefully non-malicious
attempt to block the success-
ful pass.
K-man managed yet
another Callahan point, and
Jay’s zone was hot hot hot.
Sublime’s handlers tried
to beat our zone by taking
advantage of the still day and
throwing long cross-pitch
hammers, but Cripple man-
aged to block most of them.
The result was a game that
dD had under control for the
majority of the time.

The crazy Triple Elimination
tournament format used over
the weekend meant that, with
Cambridge losing to Brunel
on Sunday morning, and
with us beating Sublime1, a
