Imperial cruise into BUSA final
BUSA Shield semi-final
Imperial Women’s 1st 10
Warwick Women’s 1st 0
By Mili Josson
Riding high after a quarter-
final victory over Brunel the
previous week, the Imperial
ladies’ tennis team were all
too ready and waiting for
Warwick, their next victims.
However, long after we were
ready, we continued waiting
for the opposition to arrive.
Warwick were randomly
on their way to Teddington
instead of Ealing. In retro-
spect, it is possible to see
this geographical error as
the point where it all began
to go so horribly wrong for
Warwick.
Eventually they turned up,
and unfortunately for our
opponents they probably
spent longer getting lost on
their journey than playing on
the courts.
Sarah ‘Speedy’ Statton won
her singles comfortably 6-2
6-1. Mili was feeling quite ill
but managed to win 6-3 6-3
against a dubious line caller.
Special thanks here must go
to Lucinda “oh-my-god-that-
ball-was-so-far-in” Lo, who
was a greatly appreciated,
unofficial and intimidating
line judge!
Yet again Caryl “I love ten-
nis” Poon showed little mercy
in her singles match, respect-
fully spitting in the face of her
opponent 6-0 6-0. Meanwhile
on court one, Warwick’s
number one player went
down 6-3 6-2. This was much
to the disappointment of her
team-mates and ever watch-
ful mother, whose hopes for
her daughter’s success were
savagely crushed by Emma
‘The Ironfist’ Marsdin.
The doubles were nicely
one-sided, Emma and Caryl
winning 8-1 followed by Sarah
and Lucinda’s 8-2 victory.
After just three hours,
we had won the semi-final
by completely destroying
Warwick 10-0 overall.

Imperial’s women’s tennis team enjoyed a comfortable 10-0 victory over Warwick in their BUSA Shield semi-final
Women’s Head of the
River
By Ben Anstiss
The Women’s Head of the
River Race was held on
Saturday 4 March, running
from Mortlake (near Chiswick
Bridge) to Putney Pier (near
Putney Bridge).
Two hundred and forty all-
female crews took part in
the timed race across Elite,
Senior, Novice and Veteran
divisions. The event was a tie
at the top of the board with
Leander and a GB composite
crew (including an Imperial
College alumnus) both clock-
ing a time of 19 minutes 20.83
seconds.
Imperial College Boat Club
entered two crews, one in
the Senior 3 category and
one in Novice, as well as an
additional Imperial/Thames/
Westminster composite crew
in Elite (who came 71st over-
all in a time of 22:10.01).
The novice girls performed
well, especially considering
their diminutive size, coming
13th in the Novice category in
a time of 24:08.39.
The top squad ladies did
remarkably well, com-
ing 21st overall in a time of
20:52.92 and fourth in Senior
3. They were just beaten by
Cambridge and Oxford’s
women’s crews for the Senior
3 Universities pennant. It was
still sweet though: after the
debacle of Nottingham win-
ning the BUSA Head eights,
our ladies easily beat them
into fifth place.
