The demands of
marketing management
are high, but so are
the rewards - in job
satisfaction and material
terms. You can find out
about the challenge of
marketing management
by spending five days
on Procter & Gamble's

Course.
We are one of the most
successful
manufacturers of fast
moving consumer
goods in the world and acknowledged leaders in the
marketing management field. The UK Company markets
such household names as Ariel, Fairy Liquid, Head &
Shoulders. Crest, Flash, Daz and Camay.
Between 21st and 25th September, we will be running an
informal, but intensive, marketing management course
for a group of final year undergraduates at our
Head Office.
Full accommodation and all expenses will be paid.
During the Course you will actively participate in
business projects ranging from product development
and consumer research to television advertising and
in-store promotion. They will give you a real feel of
the challenge, intellectual stimulation and enjoyment
of marketing management, and insight into the
broad range of activities involved. You will also
have a chance to meet some of the wide variety of
people with whom a marketing manager works.
If you are interested in learning about Marketing
Management, you should apply as soon as possible.
