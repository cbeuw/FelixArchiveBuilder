S F Sock Bulletin
H O O R A Y H O O R A Y it's the first of May another
information packed bulletin is coming your way.
Hello pigeon. I'm sorry I don't know why I wrote
that. Well, the society has been more successful
over Easter than it ever is during term. Folks, we
had a great time, and with your money as well.
Let it never be said that we are underhand. But
first the news.
F l e s h G o r d o n , M a y 5. M e c h E n g 220.
Afterwards, the A G M . including SF Soc elections
and important policy decisions. Yes, out with the
old committee in with the new. We are all
standing for re-election (all the ones who count
a n y w a y ) plus a few a d d e d e x t r a bonus
candidates. Bring membership cards and he
prepared to heckle. These elections are more
important than the Union elections (we do
actually do things after all) so should you turn up?
The answer must be yes! (YES). Other news
items: Chris Priest can't make it; our magazine
was referred to as "an object lesson in how not to
produce a fanzine" by John Collick. Not written
by any of his friends or something. Well, there it
is, another S F bulletin over. They're like life really.
Nasty, brutish, and short, and the worse for being
tampered with by Steve Marshall.

Silwood Ball
Welcome back to another fun filled term. With
Davy safely in the hands of R C S U we can
guarantee lots of fun for the Mines Exec
However, details of the treasure hunt will appear
elsewhere in the pages of this esteemed organ.
Jez is taking part in the Historic Commercial
Vehicle Club Brighton run on Sunday. The B G F E
should arrive at Brighton seafront between 12.00
and 12.30. Trains from Victoria take little more
than an hour for the journey and cost about
a mere £2 with railcard (day return). See you on
the dodgems.
All the tickets for Silwood have now been sold.
Bad luck to anyone who didn't get a ticket. If you
did get a ticket and wish to hire a dinner jacket
then a 20% reduction has been arranged with
Moss Bros in Covent Garden
Good luck with exams.

PAT A
At our last meeting Cy Challenger and Christine
Aplin described the work of the Life Care and
Housing Trust, a registered charity which helps
women with unplanned pregnancies. Advertising
alone in the u n d e r g r o u n d and L o n d o n ' s
newspapers costs their Oxford Street office
£1,500 per month despite which assistance
ranging from pregnancy tests and counselling to
help with accommodation were provided free.
Cy. herself an unmarried mother, stressed that
any woman who approached them for help was
allowed to make her own decision whether to
continue with pregnancy.
PATA's Annual General Meeting will be on
Thursday, May 14. at which Sean G o r d o n ,
student organiser of Britain's biggest political
pressure group, the Society for Protection of
Unborn Children, will be the speaker.

Seaside Trip
"Guilds Goes East" is a trip round the East End
visiting a few pubs and places of interest, and the
seaside trip will be to a top secret destination —
not necessarily on the seaside. Full details from
Ruth for these events.
The colours sub-committees will soon be
meeting. If you know of anyone who's been a star
for Guilds and think they deserve recognition you
can nominate them for colours, by Tuesday to the
chairman of the relevant club or society or to
A n d y R u s h t o n in the G u i l d s Office. Y o u r
n o m i n a t i o n s must be t r e a t e d in utmost
confidence (don't even tell the person you are
nominating — they will be disappointed if they
don't get it) and must be accompanied by half a
page saying why you think they deserve colours.
Nominations are also invited for the A M
Holbein Memorial Award — possibly the highest
award in Guilds.
Nominees must fulfil the following criteria:
1. Be someone who has proved themselves as
an enthusiastic and able sportsman for Guilds
(rather than IC).
2. Be socially enthusiastic and well-liked.
3. Be an active Union member (preferably not
on the exec).
Again, nominations should be in by Tuesday to
Andy Rushton and must be confidential.
Also, applications are invited, by May 12, for
the Holbein Travel Scholarship. If you are going
abroad to work this summer and would like some
FREE M O N E Y see the Guilds noticeboard, or
ask in the Guilds Office.
Old Centralians Trust
T H E O L D C E N T R A L I A N S T R U S T will award a
travel scholarship to a value of £100 (or possibly
more), to assist an undergraduate of the City and
Guilds College to undertake a study project
abroad during the summer vacation of 1981. The
award will be made in accordance with the
following conditions:
1. Each applicant must submit detailed plans of
his or her project — a scheme of investigation in
the general field of science, technology or
engineering — to be carried out abroad, during

vacation work which is the normal requirement of
a degree course or a course at a University

Preference may be given to applicants who have
not previously undertaken a vacation project
abroad.
2. The subject of an applicant's project must
be approved by his or her professor or tutor.
3. A scholarship may be awarded to a group
expedition but the total will not normally exceed
£100. Individual applications are requested from
two members of the Group, who must clearly
indicate the nature of their investigations covering
different aspects of the Group project. Preference
may be given to a Group expedition whose
members are all undergraduates.
4. Each project must include an approximate
timetable and travel itinerary.
5. A budget giving details of expenses involved
must also be submitted and should include travel
and accommodation expenses, together with cost
and details of any special equipment that may be
required.
6. Application forms may be obtained from the
Secretary, Old Centralians, Room 303. Sherfield
Building. The completed forms should be
returned not later than May 12, 1981.
7. A p p l i c a n t s who are selected will be
interviewed in London during May. The award
will be announced as soon as possible after the
interview.
8. Each holder of a travel scholarship will be
required to submit a preliminary and a final
project report; the preliminary report, which need
only be brief, within a month, and the final report

abroad.
