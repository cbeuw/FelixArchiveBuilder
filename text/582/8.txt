The Easter period saw the unveiling of several
interesting films. For those with time to spare
here is a brief round up.
In Superman II (A, Richard Lester) a trio of
Kryptonian super villains are set against the
man of steel, each with powers equal to his own.
N e e d l e s s to say, S u p e r m a n e v e n t u a l l y
triumphs, but not before enduring a titanic
battle on the streets of New Y o r k . The film
maintains a pace which Superman, The Movie
lacked (as much "scene setting" was required)
and is one of the few sequels which is actually
more enjoyable than the original.
Incidentally, the first S u p e r m a n film will
be shown by E N T S next Thursday.
The surprise film, for me, was Chariots Of
Fire (A, Hugh Hudson), the story of two
British athletes (Harold Abrahams and Eric
Liddell) who both wish to win the 100m gold
medal at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games. Now
this may sound a fairly dry subject but it is
presented wit ha style and refreshingenthusiasm
that m a k e s it t r e m e n d o u s l y e n j o y a b l e .
Abrahams, a Jew, was spurred on to eventual
victory by a strong undercurrent of racism
and eventually became a leading figure in
British athletics for fifty years. Lidell, a devout
Christian, caused a sensation when he refused
to compete in the 100m heats because they
were on a Sunday. Not surprisingly, there is a
certain amount of pomposity and glorified
patriotism included which suit the period well
— this adds the to the feeling of authenticity.
Highly recommended.
Roman Polanski's Tess (A) is an epic (two
hours and 51mins) adaptation of T h o m a s
Hardy's romance Tess of the D'Urbervilles. I
found, however m u c h one c o u l d admire
Polanski's excellent direction and visual sense
it was difficult to maintain interest in the plot
for the entire film. I'm sure that Polanski has
directed true to the novel but I can't help
feeling that pace was sacrificed for accuracy.
The film still stands head and shoulders above
most of the usual rubbish thrown onto cinema
screens, but you may find Thomas Hardy just
a little too boring.
The live action debut of Popeye (U, Robert
Altman) turned out to be a real mixed bag. The
casting of Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelly
Duval as Olive Oyl was inspired, along with
many more of the cast. The film is a semi-
musical, with songs by Nilsson, and follows the
adventures of the anvil-armed sailor as he
arrives at Sweethaven in search of his long lost
pappy. A t first it is almost impossible to
discern a word that anyone says, but as the
film gathers momentum things become easier.
O v e r a l l , though, it is a brave attempt to
transform a comic-strip character which never
quite s u c c e e d s . Despite some wonderful
moments it is a somewhat confusing mix of the
traditional elements. Even spinach doesn't
appear until the very end!

Scanners
David Cronenberg's latest film Scanners (he
made Shivers, Rabid and The Brood) will
appeal only to those who enjoyed his last three
films. According to box office takings — that's
a L O T of people!
Scanners are people versed in the art of E S P
and telepathy to such an extent that their
thoughts can kill . . . often with mind-blowing
(ha! ha!) s p e c i a l effects that are truly
spectacular. There is more of a story-line to
Scanners than in M r Cronenberg's previous
films, which seemed to be mostly a catalogue
of distasteful effects. However, devotees of
bad taste in films such as myself are not to be
disappointed as Scanners is M r Cronenberg's
most vile film to date!
Scanners is certainly not a "great" film such
as David Lynch's Eraserhead (he later made
Elephant Man) which is probably the most
disgusting film ever c o n c e i v e d , but it is
nevertheless immensely entertaining. It is both
s u s p e n s e f u l a n d r e a s o n a b l y well f i l m e d ,
however the acting ability of the main star Vale
(Stephen Lack — a good name!) leaves a little
to be desired. But no worry, the chief baddie,
Revok (Michael Ironside), makes up for this in
sheer viciousness. Patrick M c G o o h a n is in it
too — this is one of the few films he has made
since his Prisoner days; G o d know's why he
bothered!
Vale performs Bernie Winters impressions while
being scanned.
One point I feel is worth mentioning is that
the S O U N D effects in the film are, I found,
quite sickening. I will remember the awful
straining of telepathic brains for a long time.
So, if you want to have the full alpha-wave
scrambling experience — see Scanners at a
cinema with a decent sound system.
If you enjoy this kind of thing (goes without
saying, really) go and be scanned now! — it's
one of the few films that made my stomach feel
a trifle queasy — especially during that awful
fifteen minute sequence near the end. (Christ!
What a way to recommend a film!)

T H E H A M D R A M F I N A L , advertised as the
" H o m e C o u n t i e s N a t i o n a l Festival F i n a l " ,
transpired to be five one act plays from t h i
book Plays For Coarse Acting by Michael
Green. The plays were performed by Imper al
College Dramsoc in the Union Concert H i l l .
Ironically the plays were caricatures of the
typical amateur dramatic play, exaggerating all
the things that go wrong in such home made
efforts.
In 'Streuth' disasters such as doors jamming
and scenery collapsing were executed with
hilarious results. The actors had the difficult
task of playing the part of the amateur playing
the part, which they did very successfully.
Chris Barton delivered his lines in 'Streuth'
marvellously, with the conviction and feeling
of a ham sandwich. G o o d performances were
also given by Mark Wilson in 'The Cherry-
Sisters' as a thoroughly disgusting hunch-
backed butler, Piles, and Mike Pick-up, who
gave a marvellously over the top performance
as a Richard the Third type mad duke, in the
Shakespearian spoof 'Alls Well That Ends As
You Like It'.
T h e o t h e r p l a y s p e r f o r m e d w e r e 'II
Fornicazione' (The Adulterer), a tragic opera,
and 'The C o l l i e r s T u e s d a y T e a ' , a g r i m
Yorkshire tale by H D Lawrence.
The whole effect was superb, all that went
wrong did so to perfection. There was nothing
humdrum about Hamdram!

Journeys to Glory
(Chrysalis/Reformation)
F R O M T H E C O V E R to the record label, this
album oozes class and style. A n d like it or
loath it, the music complements the image
perfectly.
Although they are landed with the tag of
'New Romantics', this album shows Spandau
Ballet to be one step ahead of the rather more
i m m a t u r e ' F u t u r i s t ' s t a n d a r d b e a r e r s .
Ironically, the album is produced by Richard
James Burgess, former Buggies drummer ar.d
currently with another much acclaimed album
in the charts from his own futurist band —
Landscape.
By the time this is printed Musclebound will
no doubt have joined The Freeze and To Cut
A Long Story Short as former high flyers i i the
singles charts, aided by a video which cost
more to p r o d u c e than the whole a l b u m .
Musclebound is perhaps the most represen-
tative of the Spandau sound on this album,
with its non-disco danceable rhythm and its
atmosphereic evocative sound. The lyrics are
rich in imagery and stronger than any mere
rock'n'roll music. But read on
Journeys To Glory was initially conceived
two years ago and the album was recorded last
year. The image of the band is still of central
importance — 'hair' comes before 'lighting' in
the credits — but live in the clubs, much of the
o v e r t o n e is lost to pure and simple pro-
fessionalism. Though the songs are imagina-
tively reproduced, somehow the atmosphere is
not conducive to romanticism and the songs
are not suitable for cattle pen clubs. To tell you
the truth, it's only rock'n'roll, but I like it
