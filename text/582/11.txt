The heating in Falmouth/Tizard has been off for
the whole of the Easter vacation and is still off.
A n d it's bloody cold in Hall at the moment.
While I can understand the College wanting
to save costs over Easter by allowing the few
contemptible tourists, foreign students and
F E L I X Editor to freeze in glorious techni-
colour, I didn't think they would want to do
likewise to the rest of the residents when they
r e t u r n e d . W h a t about portable electrical
heating appliances? 'Fraid not, they say, fire
regulations, have some extra blankets — stuff
the fire regulations as a convenient excuse for
inefficiency!
I w o u l d advise all residents to w i t h o l d
payment of their Hall bills until the heating is
restored. They will threaten you with eviction
as they did to me in a similar situation in N o 9,
Princes Gardens last year which was without
heat for most of the winter but their threats are
as tenuous as their blankets. There is only one
way to deal with College inefficiencies, kick
'em where it hurts!

A meeting of all those interested in reforming
the H G Wells Society, or those vaguely
interested and want to know more, will take
place in the F E L I X Office at 1:00pm T O D A Y .
If you are interested but cannot attend, leave
your name and we will get in touch.

Congratulations to Colin for flying the IC flag
in typical style at the F C S Conference over
Easter. Well done, C o l baby!

A joke for all the outraged m o n a r c h i s t s
amongst you:
Q : W h y is Prince Charle's dong multicoloured?
A: Because he keeps dipping it in dye.
Okay, so you've heard it, never mind I won't
tell the one about the baby who c h u c k s
Farleys.
Thanks to
Colin, Patrick, Mark, T i m , Steve, Phil, Martin,
Ian, Maz and me.
As numbers of helpers fall off this term due
to exams, so will the number of pages of
FELIX. So, if your article isn't included, or you
don't think you've got enough to read, then
come and help — but don't fail your exams! O r
if you do fail t h e m , don't blame me and
remember than working on F E L I X is often
more important than e x a m results when
applying for non-academic jobs, such as the
B B C (non-technical).
Next week we will be announcing the winner
of the Irish "Slimmer of the Year" competition.

Like Konigsberg (which is visited each
year by s c o r e s of p e r a m b u l a t o r y
topologists, all intent on verifying that it
is impossible to cross each of the seven
b r i d g e s just o n c e ) the t o w n of
Kuratowskigrad welcomes a steady
stream of graph theorists throughout the
tourist season. Presumably they still
expect to find the three houses and the
celebrated but impossible attempt to
connect each of them to the water, gas
and electricity supplies with nine pipes
which do not cross each other.
But times change, and the three
substations have long since disappeared.
H a p p i l y , the town's propensity for
topological curiosity has not, and
Kuratowskigrad now boasts a totally
unique telephone service.
T h e r e is no c e n t r a l t e l e p h o n e
exchange: you can only phone one
house from another if there is an
independent underground cable joining
the two houses. And true to the old
tradition, no two cables cross, and no
cable passes under a house; each cable
serves only the two houses at its ends.
You might suppose that this restricts
the number of places you can telephone
from any given house, and you would be
right. Nevertheless when I visited the
town, my host proudly informed me that
he is connected to six of his friends, and
that no one in the town is connected to
less than five others.
