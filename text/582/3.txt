"Yesterday, we heard of the problems the Conservatives in Sheffield
face in helping tenants, in council houses, to be able to buy their home. I
believe in the freedom of the individual to own his property.
"Terrorist activities in this country are on the increase. I would like lo
make special mention of P C Trevor Locke and bis bravery at the Iranian
Embassy siege. Yesterday P C Locke was awarded the George M e d a l .
W e need to give support to our Police force as they face the rioting mobs
of Bristol and the molotov cocktails al Brixton.
" I n a press statement this morning, our Prime Minister. M r s
Thatcher, condemned the destruction ol Brixton. She said thai the riots
were not caused by unemployment.
" T h e unemployment figures have been used by the enemies ol the
Conservative Party to attempt to harm the good record of the
Government. But have those people practical policies to lower
unemployment .... N o of course not! They are just content on picking a
topic that in their minds will win the most votes.
"Conservatives need to hammer home their positive policies. Here is a
Press Release from yesterday's F C S Conference. Press releases must be
improved. N o wonder the local Radio station only focussed on one small
topical comment in D r Rhodes Boyson's speech.
" F i n a l l y , I suggest that a National F C S Newspaper should be created.
One edition to be issued before Fresher's Week encouraging students to
join the F C S . Then two issues a term would be sufficient to unite all the
Student Conservative Societies. There would be a chance lo link up all
our groups, not just al the annual conference which has now become a
pathetic forum lor factional infighting. We must unite lo face a common
enemy."
The result of the election lor C h a i r m a n was: T i m Linaere (Right)
205, Peter Batey (Left) 223 and Colin Palmer (Independent) 8. Once
again the Right W i n g slate won the day; with a little help from the
Neasden Papers perhaps?
