Dear Sir
A motion was brought lo the
Results U G M towards the end of
last term which asked that a
prominent member of the U n i o n
should be thrown in a convenient
expanse ol water. This motion
was b a c k e d b y M r R i c h a r d
Archer. R C S U President and a
vice-president ol I C l . and M i
Barney M c C a b e , I C U Deputy
President-elect. Two well-known
p e o p l e i n t h i s U n i o n , t w o
p o p u l a r p e o p l e w h o s e v i e w s
carry a lot of weight, because ol
the positions they bold or will
hold, but also because ol their
own personal abilities and past
deeds. This motion seems likely
to be brought again.
M r Cortazzi holds no such
position. H e is secretary ol a
political society, he writes letters
to F E L I X , and speaks al U G M s ,
a n d it is because o l this last
reason, because be says some-
thing at a U n i o n meeting, that it
has been proposed by these two
people that he should be thrown
into the R o u n d Pond. What an
i n c e n t i v e to t a k i n g part at a
U G M , to lice speech. A r c wc to
understand that if our questions
to the Executive next year are
not p h r a s e d i n the Q u e e n ' s
English, and do not come lightly
tripping oil the tongue with every
n u a n c e a n d f i n a l c o n s o n a n t
correctly emphasised to resound
throughout the Great H a l l , that
we will incur the Executive's
displeasure, and b u m there it will
be a short step to being soaked to
the skin.'
Being soaked to the skin is a
treatment one normally associates
with initiations, rait races, rag
stunts and other activities which
are automatically linked with
CCLJs. Those bodys like to think
that their union meetings are
" l u n " and this fun can often
result in prominent people in the
C C U s being punished or some-
thing similar by being drenched
or c o v e r e d w i t h u n s a v o u r y
m a t e r i a l s . Messrs A r c h e r a n d
M c C a b e . who over the last three
years have been active members
ol the R C S U now suggest that
i b i s treatment s h o u l d be c x -
lenclecl toothers. In doing so they
will usurp the cole of these C C l s
lo amuse I licit membership, and
lower the regard in which I C U
general meetings arc- held, both
those who attend and those
w bo do not.
I d o n o t e x p e c t t h a t M r
C o r l a z z i will of bis own free will
lling himself into any pond o r
bath, and I don't blame him. I
don't think that Messrs Archer or
M c C a b c expect him to do any
such thing either, and they ask
that he be Ihroun in. I suggest
that what these two people really
want is for M i Cortazzi to keep
quiet at U n i o n meetings and to
slop criticising. T o that end they
want a m o t i o n to be passed
against him at "the sovereign
hotly of the U n i o n " , ( I C U ) in the
hope that he will shut up.
It will be disgraceful if this
motion was to be discussed at
such a meeting, and I call the
proposers to withdraw it.
F i r s t l y , i f M r C o r t a z z i is
thrown against his will into 01
onto something, then whomsoever
s h a l l d o so w i l l c o m m i t t h e
criminal offence ol assault and
battery.
Secondly, the U n i o n bye-laws
give the aims of the U n i o n as
"the encouragement ol interest
by students in matters outside the
C o l l e g e c u r r i c u l u m especially
cultural and athletic interests",
and "the provision ol a corporate
Ixxly of students to represent and
to safeguard and advance the
i n t e r e s t s a n d w e l f a r e o f the
Imperial College". I do not think
that the intended treatment ol
M r Cortazzi is defined speci-
fically i n these aims, and that
it is thcrelbre ultra vires the U n i o n
c o n s t i t u t i o n . This is what is
known as a civil wrong. It would
be open to anyone in the U n i o n
t o ' i n i t i a t e c i v i l p r o c e e d i n g s
against t h e U n i o n : the E x e c
m i g h t be sued o n their o w n
behalf, a n d o n b e h a l f of the
whole U n i o n . 'Thus, if it was
attempted to throw M r Cortazzi
in. the proposers ol the motion,
the Executive and anyone else
i n v o k e d with it would be liable
l o b o t h c r i m i n a l a n d c i v i l
proceedings.
Thirdly. I here are those who
seek to bring litis U n i o n into
contempt i n the eyes of other
students particularly in London.
London Student m i g h t w e l l say
" O n e ol next year's sabbaticals al
Imperial College is seeking to
silence a U n i o n member because
be does not like the tone of the
member's voice". That will not
be safeguarding or advancing the
interest or welfare ol this U n i o n .
Fourthly, the concept that this
m o t i o n o r a n y t h i n g l i k e it
expresses is a disgraceful sub-
j u g a t i o n o l t h e D o c t r i n e o l
Freedom of Speech. Whilst it is
not so that Freedom o f Expres-
sion should permit one person to
use an excessive amount ol time
or space lo put forward any one
view i l is also not correct that
someone should be threatened
w i t h v i o l e n c e i l be dares t o
express a view at all. Y o u may be
wondering what M r Cortazzi has
done to deserve all this attention.
(You will find the motion in
E\eeuti,e Xens.) H e has expressed
an unsatisfactory opinion ol the
Exec, a n d in particular J o h n
"Dogs ol W a r " Passmore. He has
spoken at U G M s on issues that
be was interested in. He has tried
to inject some h u m o u r i n t o
L ' G M s . s o m e t h i n g w h i c h is
sorely needed, something that
M r M c C a b c h i m s e l f t h i n k s
would be helpful. For this he has
been subjected to public ridicule
by Messrs Archer and M c C a b e ,
because he has dared to criticise.
It is shameful that Executive
m e m b e r s s h o u l d support this
motion, and they will be canting
hypocrites il they continue with
it. • 11 this is their a l t i t u d e I o
criticism we might as well turn
the U n i o n into a n E x e c u t i v e
Dictatorship. They are seeking to
deny the right ol audience l o a n
individual in view ol a physical
characteristic — the sound o f his
voice. That is called discrimina-
tion. They are seeking to punish
someone for expressing a view
contrary to that o l those " i n
power" who, ol which these I w o
are good examples, have risen to
the l o p becoming buoyant by
p u t r e f a c t i o n , r i s i n g as they
rotted. That is called intolerance
and tyranny.
This is a small poml but a n
important one. II Messrs A n Tier
and M c C a b c see the role o l the
executive as dictatorial, hypo-
c r i t i c a l a n i l t y r a n n i c a l I he\
s h o u l d say s o c l e a r l y next
Thursday. II they d o not they
should apologise to M i C o t l a z z i
and to the U n i o n lor having
thought such a motion accept-
able. This m o t i o n s h o u l d be
thrown out.
