W
hen in times
of trouble,
G r i t t y
comes to
me, speaking words of
wisdom - Trump’s pants
are peed.
It’s been another
week of abject hell in
politics, but this time
the chips are falling in
the Dems’ favor. Turns
out Florida and Georgia
haven’t even counted all
their ballots (Broward
County, who would’ve
thought? Oh, right...).
In the GA race, Kemp
just straight-up tried to
hide 30,000 ballots - and
his office lied about
how many uncounted
ballots there were. And
provisional votes are
still screwed up (a judge
has ordered a recount of
all provisional ballots).
Abrams is damn close
to triggering a general
recount.
The GA race was
filthy. People were
queueing for hours to
vote; turns out thousands
of voting machines were
left in their packaging
in a warehouse, instead
of being brought out to
polling places which had
a shortage. Gee, wonder
why that is; Kemp’s a
good boy, isn’t he?
In Florida, my guy
Gillum un-conceded
(it’s informal, but Rs
are screeching “no
takesies-backsies!”) and
is in close contention
(or at least could force
a recount). Marco Rubio
(who eats with his ass
and shits out his mouth)
has claimed Democrats
are trying to “steal the
election” by counting
votes; in other words,
they’re being deliberate-
ly disingenuous. Fuck
these people.
The Kremlin’s own
Dana Rohrabacher
(R-CA) is out; Dems
have picked up a few
House races previous-
ly called for Dems.
FiveThirtyEight fore-
casts the uncalled races
as going predominantly
to Dems for a net gain
of 38 seats; the situation
is ameliorating from
election night.
The South Carolina
races were crooked as
fuck. Dems picked up
51% of all ballots cast
in the House races, and
somehow walked away
with only three seats
out of thirteen. Or, as
the conservatives say,
“it’s a republic, not a
democracy,” because
quoting the morons in
charge seems to these
CHUDs to be more
logical than reiterating
a basic commitment to
fair elections - y’know,
the fucking basics in a
democracy.
Quite impressively,
down-ballot races in
Texas went solidly blue.
Every Republican judge
(59 in all) was unseated
in the last race, thanks
to slate voting options.
The Beto hype was real;
Texas could go purple in
2020. The future is now!
In other news, Clinton
has emerged from her
compound, her army
of yes-men flunkies in
trail, whispering sweet
nothings that Ohio will
be hers in 2020. If she
is nominated in 2020 the
Democrats deserve to
lose. Please tell me we
don’t live in Hell.
In still other news,
former Trump flunky
Michael Cohen was in
DC this week, under
some strange circum-
stances. The Mueller
probe has been roused
from its electoral
slumber; Jerome Corsi
is due to be indicted for
perjury. Corsi is an OG
birther-conspiracy-the-
orist, the former Info
Wars bureau chief in DC,
and referred to fucking
Martin Luther King as
a “shakedown artist.”
It’s known that Cohen
is cooperating with the
probe; these events are
probably connected.
In Trump news, he
managed to confuse the
Baltics with the Balkans
and accused some very
confused heads of state
of starting the Yugoslav
wars. Fucking nitwit.
He hasn’t tweeted about
the Caravan since the
election since - get
this - rhetoric about
a nebulous, specious
foreign threat is used
by Trump to stoke voter
turnout among racists.
Troops have been sta-
tioned in Texas at the
border to intercept the
Caravan; they have no
power, no hot meals, are
sleeping in tent cities,
and will miss Thanks-
giving (which has made
many a neolib indignant
- I for one love celebrat-
ing genocide). Too bad
the Caravan is going to
California, you moron.
Trump’s also awarded
the medal of freedom
to the wife of one of his
biggest donors, because,
y’know, the concept of
moral commitment is
alien to this administra-
tion.
Trump’s cocooned
himself in sorrow,
bunking off Veteran’s
Day commitments to eat
cheeseburgers, watch
TV, and sob about the
walls closing in. Only
a month and a half until
his tax returns come
out…
Lastly, Congress.
Pelosi is in contention
for Speaker of the
House, and has already
declared her willingness
to “reach across the
aisle” to Republicans.
Wall. Fucking turncoat
neolibs. Funny how
McConnell mirrors this
sentiment (obstruction-
ist extraordinaire); all
of a sudden, when he’s
out of power, he turns
around with a rotten
olive branch, and in the
same op-ed begs the
Dems not to investigate
Trump. Funny how he
got $3.5M in campaign
donations from a
Russian oligarch-linked
firm. Finally - rumor has
it that McConnell met
Murdoch after-hours in
DC. Fox News hasn’t
tweeted since November
6th; they’re supporting
CNN’s lawsuit against
the White House over
the treatment of Jim
Acosta. Looks like
support among the es-
tablishment is withering
from Trump; he’s tossed
overboard like any other
bet suddenly turned
sour.
Tune in next week
for up-to-date coverage
of the apocalypse. Hail
Beelzebub!
