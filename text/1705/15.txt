“Why is
choosing
a coffee so
hard when all
you want is a
caffeine kick?”
I
magine this: you,
craving caffeine as
any typical student,
walk into a coffee
shop (or, depending on
the time of year, stumble
into the Library Café).
Scanning the menu,
you see many options –
cappuccinos, espressos,
mochas, lattes… why is
choosing a coffee so hard
when you don’t speak
Italian and all you want
is that caffeine kick?
Coffee novice or expert,
be it by an airport vending
machine or in a quirky
brewery, most of us have
probably been in that situ-
ation at some point, and it
isn’t pleasant. Therefore,
we bring to you a compre-
hensive guide to the most
common coffee drink
types you may encounter
to avoid awkwardness or
just to spice up your daily
coffee!
Note: we are aware that
the descriptions of the
coffee types below may
not necessarily fit with the
options available at typical
coffee chains, since they
usually add their own
spin on things (or confuse
the different coffee types
with each other… I mean,
really, are we surprised at
Starbucks?)
ESPRESSO
The most classic type
of coffee. A foundation to
all other types of coffee,
this is just a single shot of
coffee in a small espresso
cup, perfect for an instant
energy boost (also works
pretty well if you don’t
like the flavour of coffee
– we all know shots are
easiest to drink...). Some
say it helps with digestion,
so you may find these
being served after a meal.
It’s also the cheapest on
our list (usually).
* Espresso Doppio
A variation of the
espresso, all this means
is a double coffee shot
(instead of a single as in
a classic espresso). Ideal
for recuperating after
all-nighters.
MACCHIATO
Similar to an espresso,
a macchiato is perfect
for those who just can’t
swallow a shot of full
black coffee (or just aren’t
narcissists – some studies
show that those who drink
pure black coffee belong
to this group). To balance
out the harshness, a
spoonful of steamed milk
and foam is put on a single
espresso shot. However,
do not confuse this with
some of the more milk-
based drinks on our list –
a macchiato is still served
in a small espresso cup or
glass, and the amount of
milk is negligible.
* Long Macchiato
A variation of the
classic or ‘short’ mac-
chiato, all this means is a
double coffee shot. Basi-
cally, a macchiato version
of an espresso doppio, but
why use 3 words when
you can use 2?
CORTADO
Yet another variant of
the espresso for those who
can’t handle its intensity.
A cortado is essentially
the term for a typical
coffee with milk – an
espresso shot is combined
with a splash of warm
milk (roughly the same
quantity as the coffee, or
a dash more) to reduce
the bitterness and acidity
of the pure alternative.
Traditionally in Spain
(from where it originates),
a double shot of espresso
is used and the cortado is
served in a glass with a
metal ring base and wire
handle – fancy!
RISTRETTO
Not satisfied with the
bitterness of your tradi-
tional espresso? Look
no further. A ristretto
is a more concentrated
version of the espresso,
as it contains the same
amount of coffee but only
half the amount of water.
Truly a gold medal in the
world of the narcissist,
and an equivalent to 99%
dark chocolate – purity at
its finest. Again, find this
served in a small espresso
cup, or occasionally, an
even smaller one.
AMERICANO
In case an espresso or
a ristretto does not satisfy
your craving for a bitter
taste, an Americano is the
solution for you. These
contain a single shot of
espresso, yet filled to a
full-size cup with hot
water. With a slightly
less bitter taste due to the
dilution by water, yet sig-
nificantly more volume,
anAmericano will last you
much longer so that you
can relish the bitter taste
of coffee in peace. Fun
fact: the name originates
from American soldiers
during WWII, who would
make this coffee to make
their coffee last longer.
COLD BREW
The ‘hipster’ (does
anyone even use that
word anymore?) coffee
of 2018. Although it has
been around for much
longer, the cold brew has
gained extreme popularity
in recent summers as the
temperatures continued
to rise and the sweet-cof-
fee-haters took a stand
against coffee chains
only serving iced lattes.
Similar to an Americano,
yet with a higher coffee:

water ratio, tasting
slightly sweeter, and
brewed on cold water.
The taste, however, is
quite different – during
the brewing process,
the flavour compounds
extracted are actually not
the same as those during a
typical hot brew.
CAFFÉ LATTE
Now, where are all my
basic white bitches at? To
be completely honest, we
don’t know why this drink
has such a bad reputation.
Consisting of an espresso
shot with a larger amount
of milk than coffee (typ-
ically 1:3 or 1:4) and a
tiny bit of foam at the top
in a glass, this is perfect
for when you want coffee
with a little sweetness and
lots of volume to sip over
an extended period of time
(like that reeeally boring
Monday morning lecture).
Often features some pho-
to-worthy designs made
by swirling around the
foam layer with the coffee
beneath, also known as
‘latte art’.
CAPPUCCINO
Comparable to a latte,
just with less milk, and a
thick layer of milk foam
on the top. A sensible
middle ground between
drinking your coffee
black and boring and
overly milky, this type of
coffee is arguably the best
to drink at any time of
day and in any situation,
because, of course, you
don’t want to commit a
coffee faux-pas and order
a latte after your afternoon
meal, do you? (Italians
would argue that any kind
of milk-containing coffee
is forbidden after break-
fast, but let’s have a more
global viewpoint). An
added bonus is that many
outlets add some sprin-
kled chocolate powder on
top for a yummy finish.
FLAT WHITE
A relatively new
addition to the popularised
coffee market, a flat white
is almost identical to a
cappuccino but without
the foam or sprinkled
chocolate (boring!). For
those of you watching
your figure (or pretending
to as you buy a chocolate
chip cookie alongside
your coffee), this slightly
decreases the caloric
content of a cappuccino.
It also has a stronger taste
of coffee and is the least
sweet of all milk-based
coffee drinks. A good
all-rounder, originating in
the lands down under, and
our personal favourite.
MOCHA
Want caffeine, but
really craving chocolate
and can’t decide what hot
drink to order? The mocha
is the answer, as it is a
hybrid of a cappuccino
and hot chocolate, with
the espresso shot and
chocolate being mixed
prior, and then topped off
with steamed milk and
milk foam. A delicious
combination of flavours
and particularly good to
warm your stomach (and
soul) on bleak winter
days.
FRAPPUCCINO
Yes, this drink is the
epitome of most 15-
year-old girls’ lives. Yes,
it’s not even real coffee
(or contains marginal
amounts). Is it still a
mouth-watering dose of
sugar we like to indulge in
from time to time?Yes, for
a third time. Trademarked
by Starbucks (with other
coffee chains having
alternatives named Frosti-
nos or Frappe Crèmes),
this consists of a coffee
or crème base, blended
with ice and a variety
of syrups, sugar and/or
other sweet ingredients
and topped with whipped
cream and a decoration of
some sort. From classics
like a caramel frappuc-
cino, to limited edition
favourites like a pumpkin
spice frappuccino, this
category encompasses all
sugar-full blended coffee
drinks (and to be honest,
they don’t even all contain
coffee). Diabetes in a cup
- guaranteed.
IRISH COFFEE
For the finale, we’re
getting real: this delecta-
ble coffee drink combines
coffee, alcohol and sugar
all in one. Less commonly
found in coffee shops and
more reserved for bars or
restaurants, behind this
name you can discover
an ensemble of coffee,
whiskey, cream and a
small (although it’s a case
of preference) amount of
sugar. Don’t be fooled -
although this seems like
just an innocent coffee, it
can really get you warm
quite quickly (both liter-
ally and figuratively, if
you know what I mean),
so enjoy it over time. And
make another one as soon
as you’re done, of course.
