T
his exhibition
takes you through
Lotto’s entire
career, chrono-
logically showcasing his
development and growth
as an artist, from early
experimentation to later
existential reflection, and
constantmasteryofhuman
emotion. He demonstrates
a psychological depth that
later found more rele-
vance during the advent of
psychoanalysis, at which
point he was recognised
as “the first Italian painter
who was sensitive to
the varying states of the
human soul” by Bernard
Berenson (1895), who
refamiliarized the public
with Lotto. There’s a
universality about his
works, such as Portrait
of a Woman Inspired by
Lucrezia, reminiscent of
modern feminism, with
the sitter confidently chal-
lenging powerful social
norms of virtue and purity.
The fact that this is the
first dedicated showing
of Lotto’s works in the
National Gallery is truly
a mystery, as will become
apparent when you walk
around the three rooms
that comprise it. There
are physical examples
of objects resembling
those from the paintings
displayed in glass cases
around the rooms. They
admittedly don’t really
add much; observing the
way things are painted
in Lotto’s style is what’s
important, but since they
don’t take away from the
exhibition itself either I
didn’t really mind.
However, what the
exhibition does do is
unite many of his most
important portraits in one
place, to demonstrate his
distinctive and innovative
style. This style seems to
be an amalgamation of his
own inventiveness and in-
fluences from his travels.
Though born and trained
in Venice, he spent time in
smaller cities like Treviso,
which was located on the
German trade route. Being
exposed to techniques
north of the Alps, Lotto
fused his more traditional
Venetian painting with
German practices of crisp
rendering and attention to
detail to develop a style
unique to him. He also
travelled to Bergamo,
breathing a refreshing
vitality and humour into
his works, along with
much more experimen-
tation. For example, he
began using wide land-
scape format canvases to
allow double matrimonial
portraits, and later even
experimented with triple
portraits showing various
angles of one face.
Lotto expertly manages
to portray the personalities
of the sitters in the way
that they are dressed, their
expressions, and their sur-
roundings in the painting,
telling a story using witty
and sophisticated symbol-
ism. Five hundred years
have not yet quashed the
captivating personalities
behind the eyes of the
sitters, which, unusually
for the time, are pointed
directly at the viewer. I
appreciated the way you
can exercise your brain
in searching the portraits
for clues about the per-
sonalities and lives of the
sitters – notice how a fly
rests on the handkerchief
of an elderly physician, a
reminder of his mortality;
notice how the hand of a
young man rests on the
table amongst scattered
rose and jasmine petals,
a symbol of love and
purity. The layout of the
exhibition allows us to
notice the subtle interplay
between his portraits,
such as the connection
between the sitter of
the first portrait, Bishop
Bernardo de’ Rossi, and
the deposed queen of
Cyprus who plays the
Virgin in another portrait
in the same room.
People are often
dubious about free ex-
hibitions at well-known
galleries, as they think it
may lack the grandeur or
quality of a ticketed one.
In all honesty, I was rather
shocked that they made
this one free. Having been
to both free and more
expensive exhibitions at
the National Gallery, I
can assure you that you’ll
leave feeling astounded at
the shockingly incredible
value for (no) money!
Lucky for you, there’s
plenty of time to catch
Lorenzo Lotto Portraits,
as it’s running until
mid-February 2019.
Often overshadowed by his contemporaries, Lorenzo Lotto’s time has finally come in a rediscovery of the
wonderfully idiosyncratic works of this Venetian painter.
