A brief timeline of
the Central Library's
recent refurbishments
Isabelle Zhang
News Writer
T
he Group Study
Area on the
first floor of
Central Library
has reopened after
refurbishment began in
mid-October. Over the
past month, the Group
Study space has been
re-carpeted, furniture
has been installed, and
power has been brought
to all desks.
The refurbishments is
the latest stage in Central
Library’s Building
Project.
Phase 1 of the Building
Imperial mourns the passing of former Provost, James
Sterling
NEWS
(cont.)
Project was completed in
late 2008. Two years of
renovation on the ground
floor introduced individu-
al and group study spaces,
the Wolfson IT Learning
Suite, and the opening of
the Library Café. Prior to
Phase 1, the ground floor
had housed a Waterstones,
the Science Museum
Library, and the Haldane
Collection (the Central
Library’s humanities
collection). The Science
Museum Library was
moved to level 2, but was
eventually evicted in 2015
after a Level 2 Develop-
ment project that created
new student study spaces.
Temperature control
has been a long-standing
issue for library users.
Students repeatedly com-
plained about the lack of
ventilation in the library,
a matter that became
especially pressing during
summer exam seasons.
Amid declining NSS
ratings, the College began
Phase 2 in July 2017, to
address these issues.
In November 2017,
the library installed new
cooling systems on levels
4 and 5. Floors were refur-
bished and power sockets
added to all desks. The
construction work was
handled by the College’s
Estates Development &
Projects team, which also
managed construction
of the Prince’s Gardens
residences in 2009 and
the Putney Boathouse in
2014.
This summer, climate
control systems were
brought to levels 2 and
3, along with floor refur-
bishment, power at all
desks, and new PCs and
furniture. The Central
Library now houses over
350 student-use PCs.
In June 2017, Felix
revealed that the new
cooling system installed
in the past two years cost
£11 million, the Central
Library’s single largest
expenditure in over a
decade. The Phase 1
refurbishments cost the
Library £10.4 million; this
was funded by College,
the Wolfson Foundation,
and the Lisbet Rausing
Trust.

Untitled Unmastered
I
t's currently 11pm on
Thursday night and I
can'tthinkofatitlefor
this editorial; hence,
Untitled Unmastered. If
you caught the not-so-
subtle Kendrick Lamar
reference there, just know
I rate you. If you didn't,
it clearly means I'm not
doing a good enough job
of using these editorials
as a way for you to get
to know me. Or you
struggle to make sense of
my incessant Thursday
night ramblings. Or you
don't read these editorials
(because why would
you...?) I sincerely hope
it's the latter. Anyway, for
those who don't know, I'm
a Kendrick Lamar stan.
Ask me to write about
Kendrick and I'll write
you a thesis. Ask me to
write an editorial and I'm
fucked...
The more astute readers
amonst you will notice
that this is, in fact, the
earliest I've written my
editorial. That's right, we
have smashed last week's
record by a whopping 30
minutes! I'm currently on
course to submitting the
paper only slightly after
the official print 'deadline'.
What can I say? We just
keep getting better. The
boy is back.
This week's issue of
Felix was accompanied
by the sad news of Profes-
sor James Stirling's tragic
passing. As he retired
before I took up my
position, I never had the
pleasure of meeting Pro-
fessor Stirling. However,
through speaking to staff
and students that knew
him and colleagues that
worked closely with him,
it is abundantly clear
what a caring individual
he was. He was evidently
a genuinely nice man
and I pray that he rests
in peace. The article I've
written includes heartfelt
tributes from many of the
former Officer Trustees
who worked closely with
him and have all echoed
similar sentiments.

Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
This week's issue also
includes news about an
exciting new partnership
between Imperial and
The Times. There will be
increased communication
about this collaboration in
the coming weeks and, as
part of that, you will see
me quoted as saying the
following:
"We have a lot of very
engaged, switched on
students here who are
enthusiastic about jour-
nalism. Having the op-
portunity to work with the
Times to understand issues
affecting journalism today
is a great opportunity. The
ambassador scheme, and
having access to some of
the UK’s best journalists,
will all help. We are going
through a period when real
news and real expertise
are under a lot of threat, so
this partnership comes at
a particularly appropriate
moment."
This statement was
definitely written by me
and not provided to me
by someone in the Com-
munications team (I am
Andy Djaba and I approve
this message). In all seri-
ousness, this partnership
represents a wonderful
opportunity and a dedica-
tion to student journalism
at Imperial so come along
to the launch event in
SAF G16 from 17:30 to
19:00 on Tuesday 27th
November.
Finally, I want to end
this editorial by giving
a brief overview of my
week. I had an interview
on Monday (I have to
enter the "real world"
after this 'job' of course)
and I was, naturally, asked
about leadership and my
current role. I thought of
how best to keep the edi-
torial team motivated and
I had my eureka moment:
"Andy's Section of the
Week Awards". Every
week I will reward the
best section. This week's
winner: ARTS! Congrat-
ulations and see you at
tomorrow's social!
Nas Andriopoulos,
who served as Union
President in 2016/17, also
paid tribute to Professor
Stirling, saying:
"I had the privilege and
honour of working with
him for just a year but, in
that period, I witnessed
the dedication he showed
for the lives of students
at Imperial and a unique
compassion with which
he led. One quality that
stands out to me above all
others, is that he possessed
an unusual caring for
every student at Imperial.
We should all mourn the
loss of this great man and I
hope we can celebrate his
legacy in the years ahead.
My deepest sympathies
are with Paula [Professor
Stirling's wife], James’
family and friends – I
know he will be remem-
bered with great fondness
by the organisation he
served with such dedica-
tion and distinction."
Finally, Nick Burstow,
whowaslastyear'sDeputy
President (Education),
extended his condolences:
If you have read any-
thing about the death of
Professor James Stirling
over the last few days, you
will see references to his
academic achievements;
his Fellowship of the
Royal Society; and his
continued efforts to
improve the wellbeing
of staff at Imperial. But
what has not been men-
tioned in as much depth
as is deserved was his
dedication to students.
His dedication to us.
I had the pleasure of
working with Professor
Stirling last year, when
I served as your Deputy
President (Education). In
every meeting I shared
with him, he always
asked for the student
view on matters. For
our view on matters. No
matter how high-level
the committee, he treated
the student view as equal
to that of staff.
For someone who oc-
cupied such an important
position, Professor Stir-
ling was down-to-earth,
approachable, and totally
committed to improving
things for students.
Professor Stirling also
left a lasting impression on
me personally. As every
Deputy President (Edu-
cation) before and after
me will tell you, the first
time representing your
fellow 18,000 students
at a high-level College
committee can be daunt-
ing. But Professor Stirling
always took the trouble to
make me, and my fellow
DPEs, feel at ease and
involved in discussions.
When I started my post
last year, he asked to meet
the Union’s five Officer
Trustees to discuss our
plans for the year ahead.
When we met with him,
he had already learnt our
names, read our manifes-
tos, and knew our main
goals for the year. That
was the kind of man he
was.
As Professor Stirling’s
colleagues mourn his
passing, I think it is only
right that we students ac-
knowledge and celebrate
someone who dedicated
the last years of their
working life to improving
academia at Imperial. Pro-
fessor Stirling will be re-
membered by many as the
first Provost of Imperial,
but he will be remembered
for so much more by the
people fortunate enough
to have known him."
All those at Imperial
will continue to celebrate
all that Professor Stirling
achieved in his life and
cherish the memories of
his wisdom, grace, and
warmth. There will be an
opportunity for the Impe-
rial community to gather
in celebration of his life
and accomplishments,
details for which will be
announced very soon.
