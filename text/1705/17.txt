All We Ever Wanted Was Everything: a fabulously fresh
take on ‘gig theatre’
B
eginning at
10-years old in
the 90s against
a backdrop of
Harry Potter and Britpop,
and finally ending amidst
the more topical political
chaos of 2017, All We Ever
Wanted Was Everything
elegantly weaves together
themes of generational
rifts, failing to meet our
aspirations, and being
doomed to perpetuate the
legacy of our parents.
Despite the somewhat
melancholic themes,
there’s a buzzing
energy in the room that
extends throughout the
entire 75-minute play.
The clever use of each
performer succinctly
interchanging between
acting and playing their
instruments allows the
fusion of Luke Barnes’s
clever scriptwriting and
James Frewer’s original
music. The mood of each
era is captured perfectly
through notorious cultural
references (like Nokia
bricks and Donald Trump)
and musical parodies.
For me, the standout
performance was that of
the MC, Marc Graham,
who moved us from
one section to the next
smoothly despite the large
time jumps. He knew
exactly how to interact
with the audience and kept
the momentum of the play
going without overpow-
ering the stage. This was
aided by the well-chosen
venue, with the stage in
the centre and seating on
all four sides of the room;
the audience could really
feel almost a part of the
performance.
The plot itself was
nothing exceptional. The
familiar tale of two kids
coming to terms with
the fallacy they’ve been
convinced of by their
parents their whole lives–
that if they work hard they
can be successful – and a
harsh reality in which this
promise fails to materi-
alise. Despite following
sioned, and most of all,
unhappy.
In reality, the simplicity
of the storyline works in
their favour; without the
burden of keeping track of
a complicated narrative,
the audience can truly
appreciate Paul Graham’s
fantastic direction and the
poignant performances of
the actors.
Whether this was an
intentional choice by
Barnes or not, you leave
the theatre in a state of
self-reflection, and the
thought that maybe, just
maybe, the stories of
Chris and Leah are not
just of Chris and Leah, but
of all of us.
Younger viewers can
relate to wanting the ease
and simplicity that our
parents had; older viewers
can relate to wishing for
the opportunities and
technology that their
children have now.
All We Ever Wanted
Was Everything inter-
twines the lost hopes and
dreams of two generations
and makes us wonder
whether even though the
environment around is
constantly changing, does
human nature ever really
change? No matter who
or how old, the characters
always seemed to be after
something they didn’t
have or wallowing around
and just waiting for good
to magically come to
them.
For me, the take home
message was that the
environment we live in is
always going to leave us
wanting more, whether
that’s because of Brexit
or the housing crisis.
The play functioned as a
statement that we should
all collectively accept this
and move on, and if we do
this then we can begin to
seek a better future. We
aren’t going to simply
‘find’ a place in the world
where we belong, we must
make one for ourselves
and “live our lives”, as
Graham screams in his
final impassioned mono-
logue.
A tantalising blend of storytelling and live music, Hull-based theatre company Middle Child catapults us from
decade to decade through the bittersweet stories of Leah and Chris.
