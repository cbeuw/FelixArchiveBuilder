First Man: Review
*Spoiler Alert: THEY LANDED ON THE MOON!*
D
irected by
D a m i e n
Chazelle and
starring Ryan
Gosling and Claire Foy (as
Neil and Janet Armstrong
respectively), First Man is
an impressive depiction of
the moon landing. Damien
Chazelle opted for a very
realistic and grounded ap-
proach when tackling this
groundbreaking event.
Using nearly exclusively
handheld camera, the film
looked and felt more like
a documentary than a 21st
century blockbuster. The
film does its best not to
glorify spacefaring,;in-
stead it provides us a
very realistic look at what
the astronauts had to go
through for mankind to
touch the moon. In fact,
the film actively shows
us how underprepared
everything is, from
having to do last-minute
engineering on a seatbelt
buckle using a Swiss
Army knife, to how the
capsule that was supposed
to carry the astronauts into
space looked like it was
going to fall apart at any
time.
On top of that, the
director’s decision to fre-
quently use close-ups and
first person perspective
shots effectively thrusts
the audience into the
shoes of Neil Armstrong.
The audience feels the in-
tensity of every shudder,
every tumble and every
turn of the spacecraft that
Armstrong felt through
the camera and sound
design. My stomach
churned when Armstrong
had to stabilise the thingy
that spins really really fast
(formally known as the
multi-axis spin test inertia
facility), and my hair stood
up as the metal envelope
of the spacecrafts creaked
and groaned in high-pitch
shrieks.
The understated and
authentic performances of
Gosling and Foy augment
the film in every way.
They draw the audience
into the 140-minute saga;
they are the anchors that
ground the film of such
scope and ambition. They
carry along with them the
very sincere emotional
core of the film - the
tragic loss of the Arm-

strong’s daughter When
Armstrong is shown,
standing on the Moon,
when the Earth is only the
size of a golf ball to him,
his daughter’s death links
him back to his home and
his family. Throughout
the film, Armstrong has
avoided confronting his
daughter’s death, and
has refused to talk about
it with anyone around
him, including his wife.
It is only when he lands
on the desolate faraway
landscape of the Moon,
surrounded by silence and
emptiness, that he gains
the catharsis he desper-
ately needs. The shot of
Armstrong standing alone
on the moon, with all the
vastness of space behind
him, and dropping his
daughter’s bracelet into
the depths of a crater, in
my opinion, is the most
powerful moment of the
film. We do not know
whether Armstrong really
did that in real life, but
it is a perfect conclusion
to the emotional turmoil
experienced in the Arm-
strong household. Without
the two strong leads, this
moment would not have
worked.
This film is relentlessly
centred on Armstrong’s
perspective. In fact, rarely
are there any scenes
without Neil Armstrong.
This is effective in
confining us within the
headspace of Armstrong.
This is sometimes at the
expense of competent
cast members who are
criminally underused.
From Jason Clarke, Kyle
Chandler to Ciarán Hinds
and Corey Stoll, while
the actors and the char-
acters they portray are
equally significant in the
moon-landing process,
their presence is never felt
maily in fleeting cameos.
Even Janet Armstrong,
brilliant as Claire Foy,
does not feel like a solid
presence in the film.
These supporting char-
acters feel insignificant
to the story as the film

never shows us how these
characters influenced Neil
Armstrong. The character
deaths scattered through
the film, for example, the
death of Ed White, one of
Neil Armstrong’s closest
friends, never really
reinforces Armstrong’s
will to go to the Moon
or make him doubt the
worth of space program. It
feels like these deaths are
necessary additions just
for historical accuracy’s
sake, instead of essential
character moments.
The film also sacrifices
many opportunities to
have a more in-depth dis-
cussion of the necessity
of space programs. Along
the way, the film touches
on the socioeconomic
implications of space
programs. It tries to raise
the issue of: Is winning
the space race worth the
billions of taxpayers’
money and the many lives
of talented people? Often
these these thought-pro-
voking questions are
skimmed over in a short
montage before more
dazzling rocket launches.
Having said so, these
rather nitpicky flaws do
not affect the film’s enjoy-
ability in any significant
way. Ultimately, First
Man is a spectacular,
touching, and human
celebration of humanity’s
greatest strengths.
