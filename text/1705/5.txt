Is the haze craze kushing a tad too far?
Rejoice, stoners, for you are no longer criminals. But beware, the gates have opened to allow
the flooding of capitalisation on your prized good, and it may not be yours for long.

users all
over rejoiced
earlier this
month when Canada
became the first big
Western democracy to
legalize free use of can-
nabis. Canadians actually
rejoiced so much that the
country is now facing a
weed shortage. It seems
like the world is finally
ready to move on from the
question of whether mari-
juana should be legalized
with a resounding yes; the
matter of letting people of
all passport colours post
pictures of their favourite
kush on insta seems like a
wait for all the puzzles to
fall into place. But while
no one will be mourning
the death of the reviled
War on Drugs™, I believe
the sudden change in atti-
tude towards marijuana
should be examined, and
its integration into mass
consumerism followed
closely.
Never again will the
howling harmonica of
Graham Nash’s ‘Prison
Song’ ring true for
man smoking weed
in the modern era.
Getting in trouble for
marijuana possession or
consumption will soon
be a thing of the past,
the date stamped on the
arrest paperwork of the
last oppressed stoner,
hanging in the museums
of future millennia, will
surely not extend far
into the 2020s. Good.
It was about time. The
persecution of marijuana
was meaningless,
misguided, and mainly
a result of mass hysteria
about the hippie
counterculture.
It is also good news
that studies into the
medicinal uses of
marijuana will now be
carried out with fewer
legislative roadblocks
to overcome. This might
mean that the medicinal
power hidden in the
green plant, which had
been used to soothe
pain thousands of
years before medicinal
marijuana cards were a
thing, might finally be
unlocked. Additionally,
as tolerance by the
general public to
marijuana being used
as medication increases,
it will eventually result
in any leftover stigma
against its use to be
forgotten.
So far, the possible
implications of cannabis
becoming legalised
everywhere sound good.
So why would marijuana
consumers and members
of the general public
alike be sceptical about
the swift changes in
both the hive mind
consensus and legal
status that marijuana
has undergone? Is
it worrying that the
public image of the
cannabis enthusiast is
no longer in the mould
of Jeffrey Lebowski,
but in the shape of Elon
Musk joking that he’ll
float Tesla for $420
and blazing up on Joe
Rogan’s podcast?
The answer I’m
offering up comes in
the shape of an IKEA
box of parts – some
facts and some gnawing
fears – which have no
instructions on how to
be put together. The
reason why this situation
is so unprecedented
is that marijuana is
a complete stranger
to the new strains of
carnivorous capitalism
that humans have
thought up since it was
banished to a dungeon,
along with derivatives
of coca and opium, by
the International Opium
Convention in the early
20th century. Having
survived in the shadows,
resuscitated in part by
shady dealers, trusty
home-growing uncles,
and the starving lungs
of stoners everywhere,
there is no telling how it
will fare in the burning
light of corporate forces.
It is no wonder that
tobacco companies were
hoping to get in on the
act. Tobacco shares are
dropping, people in the
developed world are
quitting smoking. On the
other hand, millennials
love weed, having been
born into the world
of the internet, where
ubiquitous and effortless
anonymity allowed for
free discussion of taboo
subjects – including
cannabis. The subreddit
r/trees, dedicated to
all things cannabis,
is the 91st largest
subreddit by number
of subscribers, 41st if
the default subreddits
are not counted. The
market to tap into is
huge. Forbes reported
that the generations that
have recently become
over-age are causing
beer sales in the USA
to plummet, due to the
growing realisation
that the harm done by
smoking cannabis is
worth it when compared
to the dangers of
alcohol. When taking
this into account, it
makes perfect sense that
it is actually companies
on the alcoholic
beverage market
that are funnelling
the most money
into up-and-coming
cannabis companies.
Constellation Brands,
the maker of Corona
and one of the biggest
alcohol producers in the
world, has been steadily
increasing its stake
in Canopy, the most
valued medical cannabis
company in Canada.
The problems that
could arise from weed
becoming a mass
consumer product are
many.
There could be issues
with obtaining permits,
leading to a situation
where only companies
with lobbying power are
able to grow it legally.
A monopolisation of
the market, where large
producers stifle the little
guys and end up offering
a limited selection of
products, all streamlined
to feed the masses can
also easily be envisaged.

The worst scenario of all
is one where the R&D
divisions of old tobacco
firms are let loose on
cannabis, in order to
process what used to be
DIY, stoners showing off
their rolling skills and
sharing secret etiquette,
into an addictive
package, where the only
goal is to make the users
smoke more and more.
The overarching issue
that most of my friends
in stoner circles have
with it is that the “soul
of the sport” will be
sucked out of it. To me,
at least, it seems that
the fact that a CEO of
a multi-billion-dollar
corporation is so easily
abletoenhancehispublic
image by namedropping
marijuana, is a symptom
of the pendulum
swinging too far.
Smoking weed
is supposed to be
all about keeping it
cool. Something must
be wrong when the
Financial Times are
writing full-length
feature articles titled
‘What the Dutch can
teach the world about
cannabis’, with the
reporter smugly patting
himself on the back
for his “investigative
journalism” when
he braves a joint in
Amsterdam. It feels
wrong that something
that was forced to be a
quiet sign of rebellion,
of belief that the
government doesn’t
always know what’s
best, is now being used
as a token. It’s alright
to rejoice, but let us
not forget that capital
may try to take our kush
away.
