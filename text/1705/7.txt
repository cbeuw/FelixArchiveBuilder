Paypal CEO replaced by 66,000 Guardian
Readers
Comment writer Andrew Melville argues that although Tommy Robinson is on the wrong
side of history, should it be up to Paypal to regulate his speech?

W
e work hard
to achieve
the right
balance and
to ensure that our deci-
sions are values-driven
and not political.” That
was the press release
churned out by Paypal’s
PR team last Thursday,
when they announced
their decision to remove
founder and former
EDL leader Tommy
Robinson’s (real name
Stephen Yaxley-Lennon)
account in response to
an online petition with
garnered 66,000 signa-
tures. Additionally, the
Far-Right activist alleges
that “a lot” of money left
in the account has been
frozen for six months.
Earlier this year, Twitter
took a similar approach
when they removed his
‘verification’ tick, and
eventually revoked his
account’s access to the site
permanently.
Being private compa-
nies I concede that yes,
they do have the legal
right to do so, as long as
they cite the relevant fine
print in their terms and
conditions. But this sets a
dangerous precedent. We
cannot allow companies
barring customers due
to their political views
become the norm. What’s
next, George ‘Gideon’
Osborne being asked for
ID at a Wetherspoons
because of his unfortu-
nate stance on Brexit?
What happens when your
favourite iconoclast is
stripped of their money
and platform?
If you aren’t worried
by companies choosing
to define what is and isn’t
hate speech, then you
should be. Paypal now
have the precedent to
remove any public figure
that falls on the wrong side
of at least 66,000 people.
I’m sure you could find
as many ‘Men’s Rights
Activists’ that have a
grudge against Germaine
Greer. It’s reasonable to
believe that the banks
could follow suit, and it’s
not so ridiculous to extend
that to the rail services and
major airlines. Now Greer
is stuck on a Ryanair
flight and she can’t even
buy a soggy egg and cress
sandwich. Is that really
the future that liberals
want?
Of course conglom-
erates have sovereignty
over their decisions: they
can take any action that
they believe will increase
their market value, in-
cluding to discriminate at
will. Except for the fact
that they most definitely
do not. The law states that
a person merely has “the
right not to express an
opinion which one does
not hold.” Paypal justified
this action by claiming
they do not allow their
services “to be used to
promote hate or violence.”
But allowing Robinson
access to the platform does
in no way constitute a dec-
laration of support for his
political views. It would
take an impressive leap
of logic to conclude that
Paypal founder Elon Musk
voted Leave just because
Robinson was allowed to
send £4.50 for his share
of the Uber. Similarly,
Paypal fails to make such
a song and dance over the
closure of accounts found
to be processing drug-re-
lated transactions.
Discrimination on the
grounds of age, gender
reassignment, marriage
status, pregnancy, disabil-
ity, religion, sex, or sexual
orientation is illegal. Does
it not infringe on the right
to freedom of speech to
potentially be made finan-
cially insecure as a result
of your views not lining
side of history. But are
we to expect Paypal to
be the sole arbiter of pro-
gressive views? Or just
anyone who can retweet a
petition to a large enough
audience?
No matter what you
think of Yaxley-Lennon’s
views, however abhor-
rent you may consider
them, no-platforming
such radical views will
never be the way to
change public opinion.
You will never squash
controversial opinions by
no-platforming, ridicul-
ing, or simply screaming
“fascist!” repeatedly into
the abyss. Instead, they
will continue to breed
and bubble up somewhere
outside of your echo
chamber. The next thing
you know, a populist with
beliefs that you refused to
consider and challenge as
‘legitimate’ has majority
support.
Grumpy Bastard on Imperial Ethics
After some time alone, Grumpy Bastard returns to talk about Imperial ethics.
T
his week I’ve
been unfortunate
enough to be in
the middle of
Remembrance Day. In
between the white and red
poppy virtue signalling
as hard as they possibly
can. People are too busy
COMMENT

trying to work out which
wars are the right ones
to remember and which
ones should be ignored as
immoral foreign policy. I
guess we’ll just forget the
veterans that now live as
amputees, are homeless
or suffer from PTSD.
They’re just the foot
soldiers of the military-in-
dustrial complex’s attempt
to extract all the oil from
Iraqistahn anyway and not
really worth our consider-
ation. Isn’t it great when
you can sum up the causes
of a complex geopolitical
conflict in just four words?
Moving on to the main
topic of discussion this
week, ethics at Imperial
is almost a joke. The
university knows that the
majority of the student
body just don’t care
whether the actions of
the university or those of
the companies providing
sponsorship are moral or
not. Most of the people
here went through the
rigorous selection process
of having parents wealthy
enough to send you to
private school or middle
class enough to live in an
area where you don’t have
to mingle with the riff-raff.
This economic insulation,
coupled with scientists
that sincerely believe
their work happens in a
vacuum means there is
a huge moral disconnect
across the university. The
closest most of you fucks
come to encountering a
moral dilemma is whether
it’s okay to shark a fresher
or not. No one even
raises a whimper about
the dodgy shit that goes
on around here all the
time, in the understanding
that “hey, at least it’s a
prestigious university and
will be good for my future
career.”
This leaves the unethi-
cal fucks with access to
top tier talent to recruit
from. I sometimes wonder
whether Shell would be
quite so good at bribing
Nigerian governments, or
whether BAE would be
quite so good at blowing
up Yemeni civilians, or
whether Amazon would
be so good at threatening
student newspapers if they
didn’t have access to this
talent. Who knows?At the
end of the day, they all pay
rather well, boosting the
only thing this university
collectively cares about:
their graduate earning
statistics.
“Should we
expect Paypal
to be the sole
arbiter of
what is and
what isn’t
progressive?”
up with the majority?
By this I don’t claim that
Robinson is a sort of
Islamophobic Rosa Parks;
he will almost certainly be
found to be on the wrong
“The closest
you fucks
come to a
moral dilemma
is whether it’s
okay to shark a
fresher”
