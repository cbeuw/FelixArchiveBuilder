Did you go to the
Halloween ACC bar
night on October 31st?
If so, you may have seen
a bright bunch serving
tea, coffee and biscuits
just outside the Union
building. Though we too
are Imperial students, this
brightness does not refer
to any intelligence, but
rather to our neon orange
jumpers, a trademark
of the Imperial College
Christian Union (ICCU).
ICCU goes to ACC
bar nights to serve free
tea, coffee and biscuits
to students, and we invite
all students to come and
have some! We thank the
Union for the space we
get to do this, through
which we can “love [our]
neighbour as [ourselves]”
(the Gospel of Matthew,
chapter 22, verse 39).
Students come and may
also ask questions about
life and the Christian
faith: How can a good
God allow suffering?
How can we know God
exists? We welcome such
questions, as they are fair
and deserving of answers.
However, this short
article won’t answer these
questions. Rather, we
were invited to explain
why we spend our funds,
generously given to us by
members and churches,
and our time to serve
Imperial students until
3am on ACC nights.
We seek to serve and
love Imperial students by
giving them an opportuni-
ty to hear and respond to
the good news of Jesus,
which bring eternal life.
What is this good news?
God loves the people he
created so greatly that He
sent his son Jesus Christ
to bear the punishment
that we deserve. What’s
this punishment? Because
of our disobedience and
wrongdoings against God,
who created everything,
we are subject to his just
punishment, which is
eternal death. But Jesus
willingly takes on this
punishment for those who
place their faith in Jesus,
and by that faith they enter
into a personal, everlast-
ing relationship with God.
Therefore, we seek to
serve and love our peers
primarily by sharing this
message, which is realised
practically in organising
talks, promoting questions
and serving food and
drink to students on ACC
nights.
Does this sound crazy?
It may do on the surface,
but the evidence behind
our faith convicts us of its
truth. If you are skeptical,
come along to our events
and engage in discussion;
we provide free food and
drink to all. For more
info, visit iccu.co.uk. See
you at the next ACC on
November 28th!
