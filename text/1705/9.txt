“You can even
compete with
your friends
and other
students in
Imperial”
I
t has been one and
a half months since
the end of summer
break, and I guess
many of our students
already feel submerged
by the workload and are
willing to be more effi-
cient. However, simple
observations from the
classroom show us that
using our phones during
class or revision affects
our focus. Present in our
pockets, on the table or
at the back of our minds,
our phones keep us from
important tasks.
Retaining information
under such conditions
is much harder. It is
estimated that we learn
62% better when we are
away from our phones.A
study from the London
School of Economics
showed that students’
test scores increased
by 6.41% after banning
phone usage. The media
is constantly talking
about “phone addiction”.
Although we know that
using mobile technology
while working is a bad
idea, many of us still do
it anyway, so finding a
solution is essential.
If staying away from
your dear mobile phone
seems hard, don’t worry:
there is now an app re-
warding you for exactly
that. With Hold, offline
time can be fun and
rewarding.
After being contacted
by their team for a poten-
tial article, we were able
to get some useful infor-
mation and interesting
statistics about the app
as well as some personal
testing experience.
Hold was launched
in Norway in February
2016, where its founders
had noticed the impor-
tance of tackling such an
issue in classrooms. Their
success was immediate:
within the first 3 months,
more than 50,000 people
have downloaded the app.
An adoption rate of more
than 40% in Norway led
to international recogni-
tion, and the app has now
expanded to Sweden and
the UK. Consequently,
the team now has its
headquarters in London
not far from campus
and started recruiting
new members in the UK
to better fit the needs
of a newfound student
population. When the
app launched in March
2018 in the UK, Imperial
College was one of the
first universities where it
launched, and over 1,000
Imperial students already
use the app.
The concept is simple:
when you activate the
“Hold mode” in the app,
a counter will run and the
app will do everything
to help you not look at
your phone. For every
20 min spent away from
the phone, you earn
10pts that can be spent
on the Hold marketspace
(yes, that’s where to
find the reward, a real,
physical, free reward).
This includes vouchers,
discounts on products or
services, such as drinks,
snacks, cinema reduc-
tion, items of clothing,
etc. The brand has part-
nership with big compa-
nies, such as Coca-Cola,
Vue, Danske Bank, and
20th Century Fox. To
claim the rewards, you
will need your college
email address.
On top of that, you
can even compete with
your friends and other
students in Imperial by
seeing who’s got the
longest streak and points,
with the “Highscore”
functionality. Finally, no
cheating is possible: you
cannot earn Hold points
during certain times of
the night (00:00-06:00).
Being away from
your phone is working
towards a better
lifestyle, so it seems
logical that the app
sets one more thing to
protect you from – the
overworking extreme.
Therefore, no need to
spend all-nighters in the
library either.
EasilyfoundonGoogle
Play and the App store, it
is free of charge. It has
a blue and white logo as
well, not to be confused
with the Imperial app.
Upon opening the app, it
immediately welcomes
the user and gives the
cheering incentive to
push “the big button”
(could be bigger) and put
the phone on “hold”. The
rest of the app being very
intuitive (only 3 menus
subdivided in classes).
While activated, using
your phone is (almost
literally) forbidden: if
you try to swipe down to
look at your notifications,
there will be a bold “You
are on Hold. Hang in
here!” reminding you
to come back. Trying to
leave the app for another
one will reward you with
an immediate pop-up
calling you back, with
the nice message: “You
used your phone. Tap
to continue holding. Be
quick!”. Refusing to
obey will break your hold
time.
From my own expe-
rience on the app, I will
share a few points that can
make the app work for
you, and how it induces a
change in our relation to
technology. First, the app
is using everything at its
disposal to make you use
it as Hold contains all the
elements of an addictive
game: time, points that
can be lost if you stop
in the middle, reaching a
higher level, rewards and
cheerful texts. Secondly,
it helps you work better
by interrupting you if
you attempt to use your
phone. But further than
the practical aspect,
it creates a healthier
relationship with tech-
nology. The purpose of
the pop-ups, notifications
and messages is to raise
self-awareness of your
personal phone usage
while studying. Instead
of simply unlocking it,
realizing how often you
usually look at your
phone is one of the most
important points.
In my opinion, we
shouldn’t be dependent
on the app to discourage
phone usage. However,
it can be our first step
to learn how to “tame
technology” and build a
healthy relationship with
technology. Ultimately,
all the advantages of the
interconnected world
would blend nicely
together with a self-
aware, responsible use of
technology.
