I
t seems we at
ICXCAC just
can’t get enough
of soggy weather,
lack of central heating,
and world-renowned
banter. And so, on Friday
2nd
November, 15 of
London’s finest and
rowdiest decided to travel
to Imperial’s infamous
St Mary’s Mountain Hut
in Rhyd-Ddu, Northern
Wales, the international
hub for sheep-herding and
trail running.
Setting off after
lectures, labs, work or
simply a Friday of grazing
after core, the group hit
the road at around 5:30
in the evening, hoping
to reach their destination
before midnight, scrap-
ping the beloved Aldi pit
stop from the planning to
save time. After a quick
stop on the motorway to
grab dinner and logs, they
arrived at the hut pretty
much on time, delighted
to find their refuge for the
night, dry and surprisingly
not too cold and went to
bed, with high hopes for a
wonderful weekend away
from the city.
Came Saturday
morning, and a few alarms
later, each and every one
got out of bed, had a quick
breakfast of mainly carbs
andpeanutbutter,androde
the minibus to the Electric
Mountain car park, at the
foot of Mount Snowdon.
Surprised to see most
businesses closed due to
strong winds and heavy
rain, the group of fearless
runners didn’t look back
and set off on the Llan-
beris path in direction of
the summit. However,
the winds quickly started
blowing at an impressive
70mph on the steep and
rocky path, so after the
half-way mark, some of
the runners decided to
stay on the safe side and
go back, while the most
courageous/foolish opted
to push through the wind,
sometimes on all fours,
to make it to the top.
Despite the conditions
being hostile to say the
least, they made it to the
top of the 1085m high
giant and back, and the
squad regrouped in a café
in the village to enjoy a
warm and dry moment
to recover from their first
adventure of the day.
Once back to the hut,
a general atmosphere of
recovery took over while
most runners decided to
get warm by the fire, have
some more lunch, get in
a change of warm, dry
clothes and have a nice cup
of tea. However, ex-trail
captain Henry Hart and
all-round legend Charlie
McFadzean decided it
was the perfect moment to
go exploring again in the
closer mountains as they
set off for their second
run of the day. An hour
and a lot of rain later, the
pair returned to the hut to
shower as they called it a
day and decided in turn
to change into their warm
clothes for the afternoon.
Later on, the genersl
consensus was to go to the
pub for a few rewarding
drinks, so as most of
the valiant girls, led by
women’scaptainCharlotte
Barratt, ran there despite
the terrible wind and hail,
the rest of the group took
the minibus for the 3km
journey, separating them
from the Cwellyn Arms,
a fine establishment
claiming to serve 9 real
ales 9 days a week – you
just can’t go wrong
with that. After mulled
wine, Snowdonia Ale,
and whiskey and chips
during Wales’ impressive
win over Scotland in
their match of the Rugby
Autumn Internationals,
the group headed home in
the evening for dinner and
more fun.
Going only upwards
from the biscuit game,
the ever-intellectual-
ly-stimulating games
animal- then city-alphabet
were brought to an end
by trail captain Henry
Maynard’s delicious Chili
con carne, and rice con
pesto for non-meat eaters.
After dinner, a few beers,
and once everyone had
showered, the team then
went on to play the myste-
rious game of the Mafiosi,
featuring interesting
playlists and narrating
choices. As the night went
on, most were quite tired
so we all went to bed in
our sleeping bags, looking
forward to another day of
trail running, with hope-
fully more convenient
weather.
Just as the early bird
catches the worm, the
early runner makes the
most of Wales’ wonderful
trail paths. And so, with
the wind having calmed
down overnight, a 13-
strong team headed to
Llyn Cwellyn to go up
Snowdonia once again,
but this time up the
steeper Ranger’s path.
After reaching Llyn
Ffynnon-y-gwas, the path
became much rockier and
steeper. With the previous
day’s 1km vertical gain in
their legs, most of the trail
runners dropped the pace
on the path that featured a
gruelling 600m elevation
gain over a less than 3km
distance. With all that had
set off making it to the
summit, they then headed
back to the minibus as the
sky started to get clearer.
After making it back
to the hut, the team had a
quick lunch and showers,
packed their gear and got
ready to board the minibus
to head back to London,
tired but jolly after an all-
round wonderful weekend
in the land where sheep
outnumber people.
