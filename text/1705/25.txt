Microtransactions: the covert gambling ring of the
gaming community
The publisher of FIFA is preparing to sue the Belgian government in international court over legislation designed
to prevent children being able to gamble. How have we ended up here, and where will the industry go now?

T
he gambling ac-
cusation refers to
loot boxes, effec-
tively Pokémon
booster packs for in-game
cosmetics and perks.
Much like card packs,
most of the contents are
common trash, but there is
always potential of finding
something rare and flashy
that you can show off.
Fundamentally, both card
packs and lootboxes play
on the same risk-reward
system of slot machines,
and as such they can
trigger the same addiction
reactions in people. Now,
gambling in itself is fine,
and the question of wheth-
er lootboxes should exist
at all is a complicated
one. The unambiguous
issue arises when they are
prominent in games with
huge young playerbases.
Fortnite and Overwatch
are two obvious examples
of games that hit wide
demographic ranges
while hiding their items
in boxes behind paywalls.
For an adult with financial
independence, it’s up to
them to decide how they
spend their money, but
the “need” to buy these
items is a lot stronger for
impressionable kids and
teens. If everyone around
them and everyone they
watch online has cool
items, they’re going to
want to get them too, and
so often find themselves
pouring huge amounts
of money into these loot
boxes. These kids are
learning what it feels like
to gamble.
But why, then, did EA
and Battlefront burst the
bubble and lead legisla-
tures on the subject? They
pushed the system too far
and broke their game in
service of lootboxes. See,
lootboxes are a symptom
of a growing problem in
the games industry. Pub-
lishers try to extract every
bit of money possible
from every game. A game
can’t just be profitable; it
has to be the most profit-
able game on the market.
This is why you might feel
some games have been
“dumbed down” over
time. You’re probably not
wrong, simpler games can
appeal to more people.
Over time these money
grabbing practices have
become more and more
anti-consumer. It used
to be that you would sell
a game then produce
DLC (downloadable
content) down the line
for a secondary income
boost. Then publishers
started realising that they
could make even more
money by producing this
content before the game
is released while the
developers are in crunch
and waiting a few weeks
before flogging it. Finally,
they moved to carving
content out of completed
games and selling them
as DLC down the line and
even on day one. Memo-
rably, Mass Effect 3 had
two quite pivotal story
missions walled off in this
way. And if you want the
worst example, track the
ever more ludicrous world
of digital deluxe and
special editions.
But with microtrans-
actions you don’t really
need to make any more
meaningful content, and
if they’re in the form of
loot boxes you can tempt
players to spend far more
than if they just bought
what they wanted directly.
Microtransactions started
cropping up in triple A
games a few years ago,
and have now spread like
a plague. It started as a
way to sell cosmetics for
multiplayer modes, a little
bit of bonus revenue to
pay for servers, but has
now escalated to the point
where single player expe-
riences are having their
gameplay loops destroyed
in order to facilitate
selling hapless consumer
experience boosters and
item packs. If you were
wondering why the new
Assassins Creed games
have switched to a stat
based loot and level
system, it was to facilitate
the 7 pages of purchasable
upgrades and boosters
you see in Odyssey. All
in service of extracting
every last dime they can.
And here we come
to how Battlefront.
Lootboxes playing on the
addiction centres of chil-
dren’s brains is an ethical
issue, but it was only
thrown into focus because
of how far Battlefront
overstepped the line. The
entire progression system
was linked to a slow drip
feed of free lootboxes, but
of course you were more
than welcome to pay for
them yourself. However,
to unlock all content in
the £40 game you already
paid for, you would need
around 4500 hours of
play, or £1700 of lootbox-
es. This system existed
specifically so that no
matter how long the game
lasted, every player would
always have a reason to
buy just one more box.
The fan reaction was
catastrophic. When, on
Reddit, a spokesperson
for EA tried to explain
how the system hoped to
give players a sense of
“pride and accomplish-
ment” with every unlock,
it became the most down
voted comment in Reddit
history. The outrage
was so immediate, so
universal, and so vocal,
Disney threatened to take
the Star Wars licence
away from EA for fear
of them damaging the
brand. Suddenly govern-
ments across the world
woke up to the fact that
this gambling was going
on under their noses.
Belgium was just the first
country to legislate, but
many are investigating as
we speak. EA can’t afford
to let this legislation set a
precedent. For years their
FIFA series has raked
in hundreds of millions
of dollars from people
buying latest games then
later buying hundreds
of card packs to rebuild
their ultimate teams. They
refuse to let that cash cow
die, and so no matter how
bad the press is, they have
to fight Belgium, and they
have to win.
However, it’s not just
about the lootboxes. The
games industry operates
under a level of self
regulation, and if gov-
ernments started taking a
look at their flagrantly anti
consumer practices they
could be in serious trouble
of losing these sources
of recurrent income. In
the year since this PR
calamity, lootboxes have
started to vanish (at least
from triple A games),
to be replaced with the
far more openly sleazy
standard micropayments.
The industry is hoping
that they can sidestep
further scrutiny by essen-
tially saying “we messed
up, but we’ve regulated
ourselves and the problem
is solved, please go back
to looking the other way”.
But I for one hope they
don’t get away with this,
and that these companies
are forced to scale back
their dealings in micro
transactions. Once they
can’t squeeze you for all
your worth they’ll have to
go back to the old system
of making a profit by
making the best games.
So that’s where we are
today. Publishers continue
to fight for their right to
exploit you in new and
innovative ways. But EA
screwed the pooch, and
we may be at the start of
a long road that leads to a
better games industry for
customers.
