Professor Stirling receiving his honorary degree in October // Imperial College London
P
rofessor James
Stirling, who
served as Im-
perial's Provost
from August 2013 to Au-
gust 2018, passed away
on Friday 9th November,
surrounded by his family
and loved ones
Professor Stirling was
a distinguished physicist,
whose work resulted in
more than 300 research
papers. In his role as
Provost, he champi-
oned the development
and wellbeing of staff
throughout the communi-
ty, particularly focusing
on marginalised and
underrepresented groups.
Following his retirement
in Summer, and in recog-
nition of his outstanding
contributions to Physics
and the College, Professor
Stirling was awarded
an honorary doctorate
of science, Imperial’s
highest honour, at Octo-
ber’s Commemoration
Day celebration.
The Imperial commu-
nity extends its deepest
condolences to Professor
Stirling's friends and
family. Tom Wheeler,
who served as President
of Imperial College Union
in 2014/15, was "heart-
broken" to hear of Profes-
sor Stirling's passing and
added:
"I had the honour of
working with James
Stirling during my term
as Union President. He
was in touch with me
days after I was elected
and invited me into his
office to learn about the
impact I wanted to make,
and ensure he understood
the frustrations and chal-
lenges facing the student
body. He was tenacious
and focused, kind and
compassionate. I can say
with total confidence that
your time at Imperial was
made better due to his
leadership."
Lucinda Sandon-Al-
lum, who was Union
President in 2015/16,
echoed these sentiments,
saying:
"He was an extraordi-
nary man who led an ex-
ceptional life and I know
he will be sorely missed
by all. I had the great
privilege of working very
closely with James during
my year as President and
felt so fortunate to see
the difference he truly
made to the lives of every
student at Imperial. how
to implement them. My
deepest sympathies go
out to his family - I know
the Imperial community
will cherish his memory
dearly."
