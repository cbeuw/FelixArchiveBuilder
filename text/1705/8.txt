The Cultural Brain Hypothesis
Over the last few million years, humans and many other animal lineages have evolved larger brains – but why?

behaviours within populations, or “culture”, may be a driving force behind this trend. They coined this theory the

more capable

information and therefore
achieve higher intelli-
gence. Although this is a
little simplistic (and does

are also more intra-con-

have been getting progres-

intelligent. According to

improvement is occurring
at a rate of ~3 IQ points
per decade! As flattering

Culture is a product of
sociality.Socialityevolves
when the benefits of living
in close association with
conspecifics exceed the
costs. These benefits
include foraging success
and predator avoidance.
Due to these benefits,
sociality is a widespread
evolutionary phenome-
non. By its very nature,
sociality requires group
living and often leads to
the social transmission

due to the huge energy re-
quirements of brain tissue.
For the average human the
basal metabolic rate of the
brain is 10.8 calories per
hour, 20% of their total
basal calorific require-
ment. Therefore, larger
brains have evolved for a
reason, and their benefits
must warrant their energy
costs, such as the facilita-
tion of social living and
culture. Muthukrishna’s
study builds upon existing
research into the influenc-
es of ecological, environ-
mental and social factors
on brain size, helping us
piece together the evolu-
tionary puzzle. A better
understanding of the
mechanisms underlying
changes in brain volume
can give us a clearer
picture of where we have
come from, where we are
now, and where we are
heading.
