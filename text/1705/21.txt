Wildlife photography for all levels of expertise
Nature photographers
from all over the world
submitted their works to
the Wildlife Photographer
of the Year contest. From
these, a jury of photo-
journalists, biologists
and editors chose the
best shots across seven-
teen categories, now on
display. The result is a
breathtaking exhibition
with the power to awe, to
move and to disturb.
It is clear that a lot of
care was taken to ensure
the photographs were
presented at their best.
Each is set in a light panel
against a dark, minimalist
background, positioned
at eye-level in a large
size, big enough to be
fully appreciated on its
own. All in a low light
environment – collisions
with other visitors are part
of the fun! – with delicate,
nature-evoking ambient
music.
The structure of the ex-
hibition is simple and in-
tuitive. One moves swiftly
from one section to the
other, with clear informa-
tion panels marking the
transitions. These provide
additional information on
the focus of each section,
the sub-categories and the
judging criteria. An initial
oval corridor is followed
by a branching gallery,
with the two grand-prize
winners closing the show.
Overall it shouldn’t take
much longer than an
hour to see, but no rest is
provided along the way:
only the last two pictures
merit the honour of an ‘art
appreciation bench’.
Apart from the pictures
themselves, one of the
strongest aspects of the
whole exhibition are the
captions. For the aspiring
nature photographers,
technical details on
cameras, lenses and
accessories used are
provided. For those who
are choosing their next
exotic travel destination,
maps and locations are
available. Naturalists will
learn about the subject,
specific behaviour,
biological interaction or
habitat depicted. And
the rest of us won’t stay
indifferent to the amazing
stories behind each pho-
tograph, nor to the effort
their authors put to them.
Mud rolling, ice trekking
and deep sea diving to
take a photograph can
only be classified as
passion, and that feeling
permeates every picture.
References to habitat
loss, endangered species
and climate change are
not uncommon, subtly
reminding the viewers
that they might be looking
at natural relics, and edu-
cating us as to the need for
conservational efforts.
As for the stars of the
show, the photographs,
they are a rich display of
nature’s uniqueness. From
tiny microorganisms to
huge deserts, the exhibi-
tion covers every scale of
the natural world. Some
of the images are fasci-
natingly disgusting, such
as one depicting a lizard
peeping out of a carcass’s
empty eye socket. Others
are almost abstract and
supernatural, such as a
colorful composition with
algae, or a hummingbird
at a surprising angle.
Others, and curiously
the great-winners fall
into this category, depict
animal subjects in a very
human-like fashion,
appealing to our natural
empathy and striking
powerful emotions.
At the end, we leave
amazed by our world’s
wonders, and perhaps
a bit more inclined to
protect them.
White Teeth
When White Teeth was
published back in 2000,
by a hitherto-unknown,
fresh-out-of-Cambridge
Zadie Smith, it added a
fresh perspective to the
gathering conversation
about Britain’s cultural di-
versity. Smith was differ-
ent because she actually
grew up in the melting
pot of race, religion and
culture in Willesden, as a
half-Jamaican, half-white
youth. Her novel doesn’t
stray far: set in the same
area, White Teeth follows
the families of two men
– one Bangladeshi, one
English – who had become
best mates after fighting in
the war together.
It is thus significant
that the first stage adap-
tation of White Teeth was
presented at the newly-re-
furbished Kiln Theatre
(former Tricycle Theatre),
in the heart of Kilburn.
The raucous Kilburn High
Road of the play, cartoon-
ishly reconstructed on
stage by Tom Piper, is the
very street on which the
theatre stands. The play
is filled with bold, bright
characters that strut across
the stage, bumping into
each other, interacting
– preserving the chaotic
diversity that is central to
its theme.
In the midst of the
stories of the two families
lies a commentary on
Britain’s relationship with
the diverse cultures that
have made her their home,
each changing, and being
changed, by the other. The
play uses the disillusioned
dentist Rosie, who is sent
into a coma-dream by the
“local fruit-and-nutcase”
Mad Mary via an anaes-
thetic overdose, to explore
her mother Irie’s past and
the mystery of her father’s
identity. Irie, the daughter
of a Jamaican mother
and English father, grew
up with the Bangladeshi
twins Magid and Millat
Iqbal in multicultural
Willesden. The twins’
father, Samad, is a devout
Bangladeshi Muslim who
felt his faith slipping
away from his children’s
lives. He sends Magid
back to Bangladesh in
an attempt to remedy
this, and the twins follow
vastly different paths;
Millat in London becomes
involved with the militant
fundamentalist Islamic
brotherhood KEVIN,
while Magid in Bangla-
desh pledges his life to
science and, specifically,
genetic engineering.
White Teeth has a
mind-boggling number of
characters, each with their
own story that intertwines
with the others, crossing
over in a multitude of
ways that bring out both
clashes of cultures but
also the amalgamation of
different practices that is
unique to London. As a
Londoner watching the
play, one is often tickled
by the references to the
diversity we take for
granted – such as the Irish
pool hall, O’Connell’s,
that Samad and Archie
frequent, which is run by
Arabs and does not have
any pool tables.
The play is peppered
with Paul Englishby’s
feel-good tunes, with
colourful Hairspray-es-
que mass choreography.
There is a particularly
impressive sequence in
a hot pink hairdresser’s
as pink characters swivel
around and sing about
Irie’s wish to straighten
her Afro curls. The small
acoustic band plays live
for the songs, with the
musicians occasionally
participating as side char-
acters. Some have said
that the conviviality of
the show masks some of
the subtleties of Smith’s
story. Indeed, without a
narrator to tie the multiple
threads together, the play
can seem unfocused.
Perhaps it has sacrificed
some nuances for a relat-
able, generally feel-good
production, but it is en-
joyable in the way a West
End musical is enjoyable
– a visual feast presented
by an impressive cast,
built on a conversation
about cultural diversity so
relevant in Britain today.
