The eSports Hub:
The eSports Hub is our
first major trial that show-
cases the untapped poten-
tial of University esports
for our Student Union. It
was an entire week that
had been designed to look
at the different aspects of
esports, as well as focus
on the unique advantages
of having a permanent
space for our students to
train, stream online, watch
the pros, and more.
This project was
developed to accelerate
the investment from
our University into the
University esports scene,
by demonstrating it over
the course of the week
(28th Oct - 3rd Nov).
The society currently
has multiple competitive
teams, looking to continue
their successes from last
year, such as when our
Overwatch team became
runners-up in a University
eSports tournament that
hosted more than 90 teams
from across the UK.
Imperial eSports would
like to thank HyperX,
Gfinity and Shadow, our
hardware sponsors, for
making this possible.
Sports psychology
in Esports- 30th Oct,
Tuesday
We worked with Lena
Kessler, a sport psychol-
ogy consultant, to design
and run a workshop
tackling the mental at-
tributes that are required
in both sports and esports
athletes. The 90-minute
workshop focused on
introducing sports psy-
chology to our students,
which included the rele-
vance of the techniques
used by athletes, and the
importance of strong lead-
ership skills in the captain.
Imperial eSports is cur-
rently working with Sport
Imperial to potentially
turn these workshops into
a regular training session
for our first teams.
“I found the sport
psychology session very
interesting. We were en-
couraged to discuss some
questions about e-sports
from the point of view
of a sports psychologist.
We discussed things like
performance, teamwork,
and communication in
groups and then discussed
our ideas with the speaker.
At the end of the session,
we had been given some
tools to help practice
and improve on our team
communication along
with ideas of what affects
our personal performance.
Overall the session was
engaging and education-
al.” - Enda
Dota 2 1st team
practice- 31st Oct,
Wednesday
A room was provided
to our first team for their
regular practice session.
Rather than playing games
in their own rooms and
communicating through
Discord, a popular VoIP
application, the players
were able to interact with
each other directly as well
as review their game more
efficiently through the
use of the projector in the
room.
“Most members
enjoyed gaming using
better equipment than
they have at home. The
PC worked faster, and the
graphics were great. It’s
also nice to have when
you have a spare hour or
two between lectures. It
allows teams to practice
more regularly. Coaching
the team was easier. “ -

League day fun day
-1st Nov, Thursday
The fun day was added
to the rather serious
line-up of events in order
to help us extend our reach
to a broader audience. One
of our goals as a society
is to improve the public
opinion towards esports
and its players - and what
better way to do this than
letting them join us?
“League of Legends
fun day started on a bit of
a scare when we suddenly
found out that the servers
were down, but once we
got into full gear there was
no stopping! The favour-
ite event of the night was
by far the Lee Sin blind
fight. People competed in
pairs, where one player
was blindfolded while
on mouse and keyboard,
and the other had to stand
back and give instruc-
tions. No doubt it was the
most hectic event of the
evening, with the Kill of
the Hill a close second,
where players individu-
ally battled it out for the
crown (which happened to
be a Santa hat). The night
smoothly ended with a
prize giving - sponsored
by NSE!” - Julie
Crash course to
streaming- 2nd Nov,
Friday
Streaming is one of
the key contributors to
the rapid growth and
distribution of esports. If
successful, it can achieve
and exceed the viewership
numbers associated with
prime-time TV shows.
It’s an opportunity for
individuals to shape
and develop their brand
through gaming, which
demands extensive entre-
preneurship skills from
the streamer. Imperial
Enterprise Lab shared
our view on the unique
ways to encourage and
nurture an entrepreneur
mindset in our students,
and had funded us to run
the introductory course on
streaming with the Couch
Casters.
“On Friday 2nd
November, we had an
event at the eSports Hub
which was about stream-
ing and casting esports.
Gary Malazarte-Smith,
a member from the
Couch Casters, and John
Pritchard (JohnPee),
a professional esports
analyst and commentator,
came to the hub. Gary
gave us a talk about the
basics of streaming as
well as how to produce
entertaining content. After
that, we hosted a Q&A
with Gary and John. Then,
we streamed several
games that were being
played within the hub and
had other people casting
those games.” - Matt
