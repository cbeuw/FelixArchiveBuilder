ICU Disabilities Officer
H
ey guys! My
name is Sam,
and I am the
D i s a b i l i t i e s
Officer for the Student
Union here at Imperial.
My role is to represent the
interests of and improve
the university experience
for the disabled communi-
ty. There are a few ways
of defining a disability;
the way that I define it is
through the social model
of disabilities. The model
is based on the idea that
people are disabled by the
barriers that society puts
in front of them, whether
that be a physical barrier,
such as steps rather than a
ramp, or a mental barrier
caused by people’s atti-
tudes towards differences.
My mission is to ultimate-
ly make Imperial a place
where barriers of any kind
don’t exist.
One of my main goals
for the year is to boost the
profile of the university’s
amazing Disabilities
Advisory Service (DAS).
They are here to provide
tailored support to
students to help them
get through their degree.
They don’t just provide
support to students with
physical disabilities, but
rather to anyone with a
specific learning disabili-
ty, enduring mental health
condition, sensory impair-
ments, long-term medical
condition or social/com-
munication difficultlies.
There is so much more
than what many people
initially assume when you
hear about the Disabilities
Advisory Service. I would
urge anyone who needs
help of any kind and fits
into those categories to
utilise the amazing service
we have here!
