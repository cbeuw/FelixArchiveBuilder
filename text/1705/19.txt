DealingWithClair:psychologicalhorrorforthepresent
E
state agent
Clair is helping
Mike and Liz, a
young couple in
London, sell their house.
They claim they want to
act “honourably” and take
the first offer to meet their
asking price, yet it soon
becomes clear that money
is too much of a temptation
and they are willing to go
to whatever lengths to get
the best price. Prospective
buyer, James, is keen to
buy the house and ready
to pay in cash. Yet he’s
bizarrely fascinated with
Clair, insisting on dealing
exclusively with her and
eager to see the house,
and Clair, as many times
as possible.
There are so many
facets to the subtle
psychological horror of
Dealing With Clair that
it’s difficult to unpack.
James’s obsession with
Clair is clearly sinister,
but at the same time there
is a vicious undertone to
Mike and Liz’s casual
ruthlessness. Crimp
creates a sense of unease
that builds up as the play
progresses. It’s pervasive,
yet you can never put your
finger on exactly the root
of your discomfort. Genu-
inely unsettling writing is
hard to achieve and it’s a
testament to Crimp’s skill
that he does it so easily.
Fly Davis’s set is
perfect for this play. The
action takes place in a
rectangular box of trans-
parent gauze, with the
audience on all 4 sides in
a relatively small space. It
gives you the impression
that you are looking into
the lives of the characters:
something that comes to
have an eerie significance
later on in the play. The
cast certainly don’t let
down the staging. Lizzy
Watts starts off a little
stilted in the opening
scene but really grows
into her character as the
play progresses, bringing
an innocent charm to
titular character Clair.
She captures the matter-
of-fact pleasantness that
comes with her work,
whilst hinting at more
complex emotions below
the surface. Michael
Gould is excellent as
James, bringing superfi-
cial charm, with a clear
undertone of something
sinister.
There are flaws to be
sure. Anna, Mike and
Liz’s teenaged au pair,
sometimes seems out of
place as a character. She
clearly exists to empha-
size the unscrupulousness
of the couple, exploiting
this 17 year-old from Italy
as a babysitter who is
given ‘spending money’
in lieu of a salary. But
really, Anna as a character
adds little to the play and
you can’t help but wonder
if there weren’t other
ways to emphasize Mike
and Liz’s underhanded-
ness, or even whether this
emphasis is necessary.
Despite being written
more than 30 years ago,
Dealing with Clair feels
weirdly topical and often
all too real: definitely a
must-watch for any fan of
psychological horror.
You couldn’t make it up if you tried
L
ands isn’t really
about anything.
On the face of
it, it consists of
watching a tragicomedic
farce about a woman who
can’t stop bouncing on a
trampoline and her friend
who tries in vain to get her
off. But what could have
been a somewhat insensi-
tive piece about addiction
becomes both darker and
funnier thanks to the tire-
somely mundane setting.
Sophie is doing a puzzle,
describing the pieces into
a microphone, possibly
for a blog or podcast. Leah
Brotherhead is jumping
on a mini-trampoline
(trampette for the purists).
Leah tells a story about
Gordon Ramsay, and eats
a satsuma. Sophie makes
a connection and does a
dance. Leah throws the
fruit peel on the floor and
Sophie ends up picking it
up after asking her several
times to do it herself.
And so emerges the
tension, from the cracks
and the slightly sharper
than necessary words. It
soon becomes apparent
that Leah can’t get off
the trampoline, won’t
get off the trampoline.
Why? Who knows, but,
like that, the two women
who had previously been
so absorbed in their own
lives as to not notice the
other’s bizarre habits
come to loggerheads.
Leah is fantastic, a volatile
mix of self-pity and anger
– not an easy thing to pull
off when bouncing up and
down – who faces being
slapped, shouted at and
abused, all in the name of
helping her. It would take
the sensitivity of a stone
not to hear the subtext
roar of “METAPHOR”
but cliché is (narrowly)
avoided, due, in large part,
to the fact that this is a
trampoline we are talking
about.
The normally slick
script, handily provided
on the night, allows the
actors space to improvise
and decide themselves
how things should sound.
This often came in the
form of a little note after
a line saying “Actors may
choose how many times
this is repeated”. This was
sometimes less effective
as they really took this
advice to heart, spewing
out enormous refrains
of “I can’t”, “Go” and
“Leave me alone”.
When Leah does finally
step down off the tram-
poline, for the first time.
the air rings with the lack
of creaking bed springs,
which had become so
present I noticed more
that they were gone. There
is another metaphor in
that somewhere. Sophie’s
attempts to lure Leah
away from her compulsive
hobby only serve to make
Sophie look as unhinged
as Leah, only with a
hobby more acceptable to
the public mind. Further
intellectual deliberations
are interrupted by a
hilarious, though terrify-
ingly realistic fight, that
results in a puzzle being
thrown on the floor. While
ridiculous, the play has so
effectively enveloped me
at this point, I keen with
Sophie as she literally
picks up the pieces. As
I said at the beginning,
Lands isn’t really about
anything, just two friends,
who like the rest of us
can’t always take their
blinkers off and see the
people around them until
it really is too late.
