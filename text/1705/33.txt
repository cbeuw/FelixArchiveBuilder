UEA Pirates Away
A
fter last week’s
bruising defeat,
we were eager
to get back
on the field in order to
provide our rookies some
much-needed experience.
As always, the veterans
looked forward to playing
at Harlington Sports
Ground, lovingly nick-
named “The Fortress”
after our undefeated run
at home two years ago.
We were facing an old foe
in the UEA Pirates for the
5th time in the last two
years, the series having
been split so far.
Being the professional
team the Immortals are,
the team assembled in
shirt and tie to embark
on a Union minibus to
Harlington. Unfortunate-
ly, due a Union mix-up,
warm-ups started early
with players running
around South Kensington
looking for our minibus.
Eventually, the players
managed to complete the
Harlington pilgrimage in
a convoy of Ubers.

“Unfortunately,
due to a Union
mix-up, warm-
ups started
early with
players running

Kensington
looking for our
minibus”
After everyone got
changed and warmed-
up, both teams took
the sideline to observe
a minute of silence for
Remembrance Day before
taking the field to battle it
out with the Pirates. Our
tiny 16 man squad on the
day had to make due with
plenty of players filling
in at unknown positions
for the first time in their
competitive careers.
Sadly, American Football
requires very specific
knowledge and technique
for each position, which
meant we were caught off
guard quite a few times
and as a result lost the
game. However, we saw
a lot of improvements
in our special teams
and defence, whilst our
offence also took some
babystepsforwards.Some
of our more experienced
players made some big
plays, notably our MVPs:
Thomas“I’llplaylineonly

“5ft4in” Costa, Michael
“Onion and Cheese”
Anyanechi, and Daniel
“Shotgun” Grumberg. A

and Jacob “Transport For

and, with a renewed focus
on getting the basics right,
the Immortals are looking
for new players to join the
squad. We will be at JCR
this upcoming Wednesday
at lunchtime for those
who are keen to join and
want more information.
