A surprise Kamikaze for fans, critics and mumble
rappers
Although it received only mixed to positive reviews, the consistent chart-topping performances prove Eminem
will still remain dominant in the music arena for years to come.
E
minem released
the album, as
the title sug-
gests, without
warning or promotion
of any sort as opposed
to Revival which was
heavily marketed before
its release in December
2017. Kamikaze was re-
leased on the final day of
August this year, marking
his shortest recording
period in between albums.
Billboard likened the
album’s commercial suc-
cess to Beyoncé’s 2013
self-titled studio album,
also released without
pre-announcement to
critical acclaim. The
comparison becomes un-
founded given Eminem’s
track record of success,
with his last 8 studio
albums (out of 10) topping
the US and UK charts in
addition to several other
countries.
At 45 minutes and 49
seconds, Kamikaze is
Eminem’s second shortest
album in duration, only
about 7 minutes longer
than his debut album
Infinite back in 1996.
Unlike the 2017 predeces-
sor Revival which featured
prominent modern artists
(Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran,
Alicia Keys, Kehlani,
P!nk), Kamikaze featured
only two rappers and
Jessie Reyez (credited for
writing Calvin Harris and
Dua Lipa’s ‘One Kiss’) in
a total of 13 tracks.
The album’s core theme
is to diss present genera-
tion of mumble rappers
as Eminem maintains his
superiority on his inten-
sity, speed and rhyming
while delivering his tune.
Current U.S. President
Donald Trump gets a
mention in the opening
track ‘The Ringer’, whom
he also lashed on in a free-
style rap during the 2017
BET Hip Hop Awards.
‘The Greatest’and ‘Lucky
You’ heavily disses
rappers including Joe
Budden, Tyler the Creator,
Ja Rule, Drake and even
South African band Die
Antwoord. He denotes the
phrase “mumble rap” for
rappers who showed little
flair in rap vocabulary
and intensity, in contrast
with his powerful vocal
delivery. During an early
September interview with
Sway Calloway about his
latest album, he admits
dissing them for variety
of reasons – mostly on
below-par rappers who
have the cheek to criticise
his works and re-ignition
of several past feuds.
Eminem certainly
doesn’t need introduction
on his rapping tempo. If
you thought his “super-
sonic speed” section in
‘Rap God’ was insane
with a record of 101
words in 16.45 seconds,
Eminem seemingly broke
his own record during his
mesmerising second verse
in ‘Lucky You’ where
within a 16-second part
he managed to rap about
110 words. In that track he
collaborated with Joyner
Lucas, an underrated Mas-
sachusetts rapper who had
a gripping rap panache of
his own. Joyner concurred
with Eminem’s notion of
“lesser rappers getting the
attention” by alluding “all
my life, I want a Grammy
/ but I’ll probably never
get it” in his lines. A
repentant Eminem admits
“selling his soul to win
some Grammys in his
past” in the subsequent
verse. Eminem also
reunited with fellow Bad
Meets Evil partner Royce
da 5’9” (famed for ‘Fast
Lane’ and ‘Lighters’
with Bruno Mars) in the
track ‘Not Alike’, dissing
rapper Machine Gun
Kelly (MGK) who last
year shot to fame with his
single ‘Bad Things’ with
Camila Cabello.
As the album goes on,
listeners may find the tone
and rhythm becoming a
tad repetitive while the
dissing theme fades. The
title track ‘Kamikaze’
and ‘Fall’ focuses more
on Eminem’s frustration
at his last album, Revival
receiving poor reviews
and critics. The penulti-
mate tracks ‘Nice Guy’
and ‘Good Guy’ featuring
up-and-coming singer
Jessie Reyez shifts to
themes about trying to be
the nice guy in baffling
relationships. The final
track ‘Venom’ is a motion
picture soundtrack from
the freshly released Tom
Hardy movie, which
Eminem references
heavily.
The diss tracks certain-
ly collected attentions of
the name-dropped artists,
most notably MGK who
tweeted about Eminem’s
daughter Hailie “being
hot” back in 2012 (another
reason to not fuck with
Dad). MGK is the only
artist who responded with
a full track ‘Rap Devil’
alludingtoEminem’s‘Rap
God’. Eminem recorded
his comeback ‘Killshot’
within two weeks but was
reluctant to ‘popularise’
MGK with the response
track, as quoted in the
same Sway interview.
As of this writing, the
‘Killshot’ audio track
has amassed 177 million
views on YouTube, almost
24 million more than
MGK’s ‘Rap Devil’music
video released in the
same period. Like most
of his previous albums,
Kamikaze does not shy
away from controversies
regarding his alleged
homophobic lyrics. He
did apologise for “going
too far” but in truth this is
nothing new regarding his
style for die-hard fans.
In a nutshell, Kamikaze
may not be his best work
to date, but at 46, Eminem
shows no signs of slowing
down and is still at the top
of his game. If he keeps
producing records while
casting other artists in the
limelight, none of us will
be able to keep him away
from the music spotlight.
In early September BBC
news suggested the
“greatest” rapper should
consider quitting while
still in his prime. Until
then, guess who’s back,
back again?
