Is Post Malone culpable for exploiting hip-hop?
Jordan Bunke considers the causes and consequences of Post Malone’s success, wondering if he has bastardised
hip-hop on his path to success.
T
he 2010s have
marked a signif-
icant shift in the
music industry
and music consumption
in two interesting ways:
platform and genre.
Consumers are increas-
ingly moving away
from purchasing music,
whether vinyl, CDs, or
downloads, and moving
towards streaming. As
part of their efforts to ac-
curately capture the music
that is being listened to
most, major music chart
tabulators like Billboard
have adjusted to this
trend. As of 2018, stream-
ing constitutes the single
largest category for the
weighting of songs on the
Billboard Hot 100—more
than both radio airplay and
digital sales. Spotify is the
largest paid subscription
music streaming service
with over 71 million
subscribers and a 30 mil-
lion subscriber lead over
Apple Music. The genres
of music that dominate the
charts have also shifted. In
2017, for the first time in
history, hip-hop became
the most listened-to genre
of music in the US, and
its lead has only extended
in the time since. This
shift can be linked in
part to the fact that the
primary platform of music
consumption is no longer
radio, where censorship
and a lowest-common-de-
nominator mindset led
to the prevalence of pop
music. Now that most
music consumers are ac-
tively choosing what they
listen to more so than in
times past, (curating play-
lists, playing artist radio)
genres that are censored
by gatekeepers gain more
consumption.
Another factor that
explains the rise of
hip-hop is the shift within
hip-hop towards a more
pop-friendly soundscape,
issued in part by cross-
over acts like Kanye
West and Drake about a
decade ago. It is hard to
trace common stylistic
and sonic elements from
hip-hop in the 1980s and
hip-hop today, which
leads to the assertion that,
by and large, hip-hop is a
formless genre. There are
no real musical criteria,
tempo, drum pattern, or
anything inherent in the
music that is required for
a song to be considered
hip-hop by consumers.
Rather, the genre is
commonly characterised
by characters: subject
matter, lingo, tropes, and
participants. This sort of
mischaracterisation and,
dare I say, bastardisation
of hip-hop has been oc-

real musical
critera... for
a song to be

most from a culture that
he isn’t fully committed
to.
In 2017, Post Malone
got in trouble for a
comment that he made
while drunk in an inter-
view in Poland. While
discussing his stance on
rap, Post said, “If you’re

has resulted in a quagmire
that has received ample
attention from several
outlets, from music blogs
to LA Times think pieces:
Post Malone.
If someone asked me
what the most streamed
album of 2018 was, and
I didn’t know better, I
would respond, “Scorpion
by Drake” without a
moment’s hesitation. In
terms of charting domi-
nation, tour revenue, and
his uncanny ability to
occupy the zeitgeist, it
is hard to dispute that he
is the biggest music act
in the world. However,
I would be wrong. The
most-streamed album of
2018, at least on Spotify,
is Post Malone’s Beer-
bongs & Bentleys. Upon
investigation, this isn’t a
huge surprise. Between

commercial performance.
Post Malone’s biggest hits
are “Congratulations,” “I
Fall Apart,” “Rockstar,”
and “Psycho.” All these
tracks have a runtime that
is within three seconds of
being 3:40 long. Post or
someone in his creative
camp seems to be aware
of this homogeneity, as 13

record held by Michael
Jackson’s Thriller for the
most consecutive weeks
spent in the top 10 of
the Top R&B/Hip-Hop

isn’t that he is a shame-
lessly commercial artist.
The problem with Post
Malone is that he benefits

A new muse-cal direction
Three years after the
conclusion of Drones, the
English “rock” band Muse
returns with their eighth
studio album, Simulation
Theory. Unlike anything
they have released before,
Simulation Theory is a po-
lariser that will fragment
their fanbase with its
shockingly foreign
soundscapes of electronic
rock and synth-pop.
Guitarist and lead singer
Matt Bellamy’s unique
is a simulation, inspired
by Bellamy’s concern
of world domination by
technological conspira-
cies over the majority of
Muse’s career.
‘Thought Contagion’
and ‘The Void’ see a
relatively effective and
natural juxtaposition of
electronica and rock.
However, in an attempt
to make up for different
stylistic absences in their
previous albums and
break out of singing about
fearing the corrupt power
structure, most tracks
including ‘Propaganda’
and ‘Break it to Me’, are
overbearing, crowded
pieces that unfold like an
automatic pop-up tent in a
portaloo. Lyrically, many
songs on the album like
‘Blockades’, are complex
and introspective, but the
messages are drowned
out by the overwhelming
unload of electronica,
which devalues them to
the static noise playing in
a cheap night club. The
album is merely diluted by
the stripped back acoustic
versions of the tracks,
which I predict will be
streamed more frequently
than the laptop music
originals. What looks like
an 80s Daddy Yankee/
Sean Paul collaboration
behind the Risky Busi-
ness-borrowed cursive
neon pink font, the cover
art design is convoluted
and very much reflective
of the overproduced and
crammed tracks that the
album contains.
A drifting piece of tum-
bleweed in today’s music
charts, Simulation Theory
is too innovative and
likely to be remembered
by Muse’s diehard fans
as a distasteful and messy
mix of futuristic and 80s
techno pop sounds… if it
will be remembered at all.
Maryana says the new muse album is as jarring as its album cover
consumers. He himself
associates hip-hop with
the gimmicks and carica-
tures that some now use
to define it in place of
concrete sonic standard
that no longer exists. His
first single had him in
Texas. He moved to LA
as a kid who loved Guitar
Hero with a dream of
making it in music. He
produced his debut single
“White Iverson” himself
and designed the cover art.
Despite the oft-shallow
content of his lyrics and
his ad nauseum recycling
of already tired tropes,
one cannot deny his
penchant for hit-making
and keen ear for melodies.
He is clearly talented and
has a lofty ceiling in the
music industry. However,
he can’t eat his cake and
have it too if he wants
to go down as one of the
greats and not just a fad
that listeners shamefully
remember for pushing to
the top of the charts. Igno-
rance is no excuse for the
exploitation of the culture.

hooping gear sporting
cornrows and a grill,
proclaiming himself to be
the “White Iverson”. Over
the course of his career,
he has added face tattoo
after face tattoo to his
growing collection. This
is how Post Malone views
hip-hop. Gimmicks from
a fringe of Lil Wayne-in-
spired late millennials
whose domain is confined
to YouTube and Insta-
gram. It is worth noting
that it is entirely possible
to be a hip-hop head and
have never encountered
Post Malone; in fact, it
is quite common. Like
Eminem, to whom Post
is compared for obvious
reasons, Post Malone’s
fan demographic differs
drastically from most
other mainstream hip-hop
acts. However, unlike
Post Malone, Eminem
unabashedly embraced
the culture and staunchly
identifies as a hip-hop act
and a rapper.
Post Malone was born
in Syracuse, New York
and grew up in Dallas,
“He has

not enough of its runtime
proportion is hip-hop.
Post Malone has rejected
the “rapper” and “hip-
hop” labels in the past,
preferring to consider
himself a “musician” or a
“rockstar”. As his quote to
the Polish outlet indicates,
