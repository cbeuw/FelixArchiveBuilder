Turns out it’s possible to beat them at their own game
E
arlier this month,
the Imperial
College Model
United Nations
Society, represented by
Alessandro, Ben, Chris,
Tawfik and myself,
took over Oxford for 3
intense days with a mix
of missed trains, cold and
rainy weather, fun socials
and a bit of debate. The
Oxford International
Model United Nations
(OxIMUN) conference is
one of the largest and most
prestigious University-
level Model United
Nations (MUN) in the
country. 5 students, rep-
resenting 5 countries in
5 different committees,
tried to save the world in
these 3 days. Easier said
than done.
DISEC, a committee
focused in disarmament,
was chaired by the
lookalike of Tommy
Shelby / Cillian Murphy.
Our delegate represented
Saudi Arabia and debated
the weaponization of AI
and big data and the risks
inherent to such technolo-
gies. A resolution passed
requesting an implemen-
tation of controls on the
research of this field. The
second part of the debate
focused on terrorism in
Somalia, concluding in
the approval of military
intervention in the
country and financial aid
to the government, as well
as long-term solutions to
help the local population.
come up with a balanced
resolution on the Status
of Jerusalem. More
advances were made to
solve this decade-long
conflict in half a day than
in the last 60 years, partly
thanks to the Chinese
peace plan proposal to
fund solar panels in order
to resume direct bilateral
talks between the Parties
involved (in other words,
nothing made sense in this
committee).
In the Economic and
Social Council, often
referred to more simply
as ECOSOC, the topics
of discussion were the
opioid crisis and the using
as property rights as a tool
to deal with the informal
economy. A Canadian
submitted resolution
passed in each of the two
topics, with overwhelm-
ing majority in both cases.
All delegates had the
chance to be personally
entertained by a “poetry
on postcards” by one of
the chairs. Nothing to add
to that.

interesting yet consensual.
However, a resolution that
was voted on approved
the sending of a teddy
bear to every migrant
child via parachute. Who
said politicians did not
have a heart?
Last but not least, we
were also represented in
the International Court
of Justice by a Ugandan
Judge. The case opposed
India v Pakistan where
India accuses Pakistan
of violating the Vienna
Convention by denying
India consular access to a
suspected Indian spy that
was court martialed and
sentenced to death. As
a judge in the court, the
weekend was spent inter-
rogating advocates from
both parties, questioning
evidence, witnesses and
legal experts to determine
whether international laws
were violated, interpreting
and assessing the legality
of various treaties to be
able to pass judgement –
indeed very easy tasks for
a Bioeng student.

Our French repre-
sentative in the Security
Council started the
weekend talking about
the Rohingya crisis in
Myanmar and had to
cope with a historic and
unexpected Chinese-Rus-
sian-American triple veto
against the French-led
bloc. The international
community did manage,
surprisingly again, to
Congratulations to
the five members of the
delegation for their hard
work throughout the
weekend, as they brought
back 4 awards from this
prestigious conference.
Another group of 9
Imperial students went to
Cambridge for yet another
weekend of debate and
fun, and you will have a
complete recap next week.

a framework for the
protection of the rights
of migrant children and
reaffirmed that reproduc-
