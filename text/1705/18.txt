Pain and Polyamory
P
ride and
Prejudice, Sense
and Sensibility,
Emma; these clas-
sic Jane Austen novels are
probably very familiar to
the well-read student body
at Imperial. However,
the Austentatious theatre
company brings some of
her long lost (never writ-
ten) works to the stage
using the art of improv.
At the beginning of
every show the audience
suggests a title to a lost
novel, and a 2 hour long
performance of impro-
vised hilarity then ensues!
No two shows are alike
and at this performance,
some hilarious titles were
suggested: ‘North End
Abbey Road’, a Beatles
themed Jane Austen
novel; ‘Gay Pride and
Prejudice’, Jane Austen
in 2018; even ‘MeToo
Mr. Darcy’ – a chillingly
pertinent title consid-
ering recent headlines.
However, the lost novel
performed was the family
favourite: ‘Pain and Poly-
amory’.
Once the title was
chosen, the large box on
stage was opened to the
sound of old-timey Auste-
nesque music played by
two improv musicians on
the right of the stage. It
revealed a simple yet ver-
satile set design – a 19th
century decorated room.
During the show, the
actors found increasingly
creative ways of making
this room into a bedroom,
living room, church and
even a sex dungeon. The
only props the actors
had to work with were a
couple of chairs, a scarf,
and a round table (which
spent much of its time
as a font in the village
church). Any other props
had to be imagined by
both the audience and
the actors. The hilarity in
seeing someone read an
imaginary book or ride
an imaginary horse seems
infantile but worked per-
fectly with the audience
erupting into laughter
(spin the bottle but with
more sex) hosted by
Mr Spencer (Graham
Dickson) and meet
Colonel Quincy (Andrew
Hunter Murray) and
Malcolm Bobson (son of
Bob Bobson, portrayed by
Daniel Nils Roberts).
After a night of dis-
graceful behaviour, some
characters start to question
their actions and get
reprimanded by the town
vicar (Joseph Morpurgo).
Many scenes later, after a
lot of drama and a quick
trip down to the Prince
Regent’s torture garden
in London for some more
debauchery, the story
comes to an end.
One area which was
definitely lacking was the
plot. In certain scenes, the
actors probably needed
someone to download Cit-
ymapper onto their phones
as they were lost with no
idea what direction to go.
This would usually result
in some meaningless con-
versation happening until
the lights would go down,
signifying the scene was
over. This being said, due
to the improvised nature
of the performance, the
audience did not come
for plot as much as they
did for cheap laughs –
which were definitely
not lacking! Ms. Amy
Cooke-Hodgson who
played Laetitia was the
star of the show in this
respect, coming out with
hysterically witty one-lin-
ers. She would often burst
onto stage, interrupting
the scene with a quick
one-liner and then scurry
off – her impeccable
timing would leave both
the audience and some-
imally (maybe a scarf
around the head), the
voice, the tone and the
mannerisms made it
clear what character was
on stage. Dickson and
Roberts stuck to the same
characters throughout,
which was rather dis-
appointing as it did not
give them room to shine.
Even though they did
both deliver many funny
lines, the other actors
such as Cooke-Hodgson
and Morpurgo outshone
them in this particular
performance.
Overall, the perfor-
mance was effective in
keeping the audience
giggling, laughing, and
even crying from the
ingenious dialogue. This
was made all the funnier
performed in the prim
and proper English of 19th
century Britain. Much
more of a comedy show
than a play, anyone can
enjoy Austentatious – no
prior Austen knowledge
necessary!
