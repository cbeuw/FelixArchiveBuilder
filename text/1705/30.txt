Confusion and mayhem as Union Council ends early
HANGMAN
Chaos ensued at
Union Council this
week as elected reps
managed to conclude
the meeting ahead of
schedule.

T
he meeting, held
in the Royal
School of Mines
his past Tuesday,
rounded up at 19:17 GMT,
less than an hour after it
was began, with over 70
papers approved.
Newly elected Repre-
sentatives were perturbed
as ex-officio members
were reported to all have
a dead look in their eyes,
continuously pressing
‘yes’ on their keypads for
the entirety of the session.
When asked to present
papers, members were
said to simply say, “as
tabled, any questions?”
before calling for a vote.
“This is completely
unacceptable,” whined
Slavomir Gazpacho,
Undergraduate Reprehen-
sible to Council (Engi-
neering), “it didn’t even
end late enough for me to
get the half price Wasabi
deal! Why on Earth would
I pay full price for chicken
katsu? The madness of
capitalism! ”
Bureaucracy Coordi-
nator, Harleen Winans,
was seen running around
attempting to coax
members of the Council
to bring up any other
business. “Listen here,
you little shit,” she was
overheard saying to Arsh
Bantersea, representing
Natural Séances, “I work
part time and my rate is
by the hour, and Lord
knows you lot don’t pay
me enough to listen to this
crap anyway, so you better
bring up a damn motion
or so help me I will flood
your e-mails with meeting
invites!”
The fracas was said
to have been initiated by
former Council Chair Eoin
Sheeney, who, reportedly
enraged at the early finish,
flipped over a table shout-
ing “SCIENTIA IMPERII
DECUS ET TUTAMEN!”
whilst dashing his keypad
at Beryl Reel, Deputy
President (Fanfare).
The increased effiency
was determined to be
due to the new seating
arrangement instituted
noted that members were
forced to sit next to com-
plete strangers, and hence
could not be bothered to
start up mind-numbingly
dul conversations with
other sad Imperial stu-
dents.
Amongst the papers
passed on Tuesday was
the new Constitution of
the Union, which unbe-
knownst to the officers,
included the Council
Chair role as a paid
Sabbatical position with
powers above that of the
Union President, starting
retrospectively from
August this year.
“You think I was gonna
let my paycheque go that
easily?,” Ms Compote
was reported to have said,
“I’ve been eating good for
Royal School of Mines // Imperial College London
the past two years now
and I’ll be damned if I let
some hotshot miner boy
deny me of my conquest
of this place - all he knows
how to do is colour!”
Ms Compote was
found to be a recipient
of the of an honorary
life membership award
from the Union, the
fifth time which she has
received this award.
NegaFelix has learnt she
has requested the award
be given in cash value, to
the tune of £40.

even end late
enough for me
to get the half
price Wasabi
deal! ”

Compote, former Union
President and current
Council Chair. Sources
