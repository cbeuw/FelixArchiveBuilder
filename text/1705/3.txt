magine yourself
sat in a pub, with
your mates, chat-
ting about fashion
trends. Now, if one of
your friends suggested
the moustache deserved
a comeback, would you
grow a ‘Mo’? Most
likely not… but what if
it were for charity?
This is exactly what
happened fifteen years
ago, in Melbourne;
little did these charity
moustache pioneers
know - they would change
the world at the pub that
night. With a mere 30
Mo-Bros and a 10AUD
donation for each mous-
tache grown, the Movem-
ber Foundation was born.
Since then, the Movember
Foundation has funded
more than 1,200 men’s
health projects worldwide
and, by 2030, they aim
to reduce the number of
male premature deaths
by 25%. Last year alone,
they raised over £48,000
for men’s health.
The Movember Foun-
dation addresses some of
the biggest health issues
faced by men; prostate
cancer, testicular cancer,
mental health and suicide
prevention. Men’s health
often remains glossed
over, despite the fact that
men tend to experience
worse longer-term health
than women, in addition
to a shorter life expectan-
cy. Prostate cancer rates
are forecast to double
in the next fifteen years,
and testicular cancer rates
have already doubled in
the last fifty years. Three
quarters of all suicides
are male; half a million
men take their lives every
year. That’s a man every
minute.
Nevertheless, we can
all take action to live
healthier, happier, longer
lives – and Imperial
College’s RAG (Raising
and Giving) want to
help you to do so. We
encourage you to make
time for yourself and for
your friends. 70% of men
say their friends can rely
on them for support, but
only 48% say that they
rely on their friends. In
other words: we’re here
for our mates, but worried
about asking for help for
ourselves. Reaching out is
crucial; it is important to
have open conversations.
family history, but we can
get you involved in many
really cool activities this
month.

University Jailbreak – this
is one of ICU RAG’s
big events! Tomorrow,
our fellow students shall
embark on a thirty-six-
hour challenge, in which
they must get as far away
from campus as possible
by hitchhiking. In past
years, students have made
it as far as Indonesia, and
individual groups have
raised almost £2,000!

For Movember, we are
holding pub quizzes at
H-Bar, hosting bar nights,
and organising various
fundraising events at the
Union (keep your eyes and
ears open for an upcoming
‘Hot Wings Challenge’)!
Nevertheless, this year, we
want to put a focus on you
really understanding the
cause behind Movember.
If you want to learn more
about Movember – specif-
ically its causes (prostate
cancer, testicular cancer,
men’s health and suicide
prevention), join us at
our Movember panel on
Monday 19th
November,
at 6:30pm, in Sir Alexan-

You should also know
if you are particularly
susceptible to certain dis-
eases, and when to talk to
your doctor. If you have a
family history of prostate
cancer, or other forms of
cancer, extra precaution
should be taken. In ad-
dition, perform regular
self-checks. I.e. Get to
know what’s normal for
your testicles. Give them
a check regularly and go
to the doctor if something
doesn’t feel right. Finally,
make sure you are getting
enough physical activity.
Whilst this can be difficult
with our busy schedules,
small things like taking
the stairs instead of lifts,
getting off a bus stop (or
two) early can make a
difference.
Now, ICU RAG cannot
help you with the self-
checks, nor with your

I
mperial has an-
nounced an exciting
new collaboration
with Times News-
papers Ltd to “advance
their shared interests in
the future of science and
culture” and including a
year-long programme of
joint events and activity
led by the student com-
munity at Imperial.
The media partnership,
which will see all full
time Imperial staff and
students receive a year-
long free subscription
to The Times and The
Sunday Times, has been
described as “more than
just a commercial partner-
ship” and will involve an
ambassador scheme for
selected students. The five
selected ambassadors will
play a key role in the part-
nership, helping to launch
events, coming up with
new initiatives and ideas,
and generally promoting
the relationship between
the College and one of the
UK’s best known newspa-
pers.
The aim of this
relatioThe aim of this
relationship is to stimulate
debate, provoke curiosity
and encourage explora-
tion. In an era when both
experts and journalists
are under unprecedented
scrutiny, this partnership
provides an opportunity
to look at the benefits of
the media and academia
to society. The university
will be hosting debates
and panel discussions
featuring leading Times
journalists, special guests
and Imperial students,
talking about a wide
range of issues concern-
ing science, culture and
communication. The first
of these will be the launch
event, “What the Hell is
going on?”, taking place
from 17:30 to 19:00 on
Tuesday 27th November
in Sir Alexander Fleming
(SAF) Room G16. The
event will feature a Q
& A with leading Times
satirical columnist, Matt
Chorley, and his guest,
a well-known political
figure. The event promis-
es lively discussion, live
voting and giveaways,
followed by refreshments.
Emma Tucker, Deputy
Editor of The Times had
this to say about the part-
nership:
“The Times and The
Sunday Times are de-
lighted to partner with
Imperial College London
to promote our shared
belief that it has never
been more important for
young people to develop a
breadth of knowledge and
to stay up to date with the
news."
There is an emphasis on
ensuring this partnership
is student-driven. Rob
Tomkies, President of the
Imperial College Union,
said:
"We’re very excited
about this partnership
and the potential it has
to benefit the student
community at Imperial.
The free subscription is a
great offer, but we also see
this relationship as a way
of exploring the broader
issues around journalism,
communication and
culture - empowering
people to lead and com-
municate in all fields
not just their scientific
specialism."
Not only will the select-
ed Student Ambassadors
have the opportunity to
come up with event ideas,
topics for debate and “help
design, run and write”
about the events organised
by The Times on campus,
but they will also get “a
bunch of perks such as
tutoring, workshops and
resource from The Times.
Imperial students will also
have access to The Times'
offices, and will learn
about journalism and
wider communications
issues by talking directly
with the newspaper’s staff
and some of its leading
commentators.
Talks are also under
way about how The Times
will be involved in the
2019 festival at the end of
June 2019.
Details of the Ambas-
sador Scheme and how to
apply will be released on
Monday 19th
November.

Mo' Bros //The Movember Foundation
Imperial. She believes that
since it began in 2004, the
Movember campaign has
increased awareness of
prostate cancer enormous-
ly, to the point where it is
now something that can
be talked about in public;
it is no longer seen as an
embarrassing disease of
ageing. At the panel, she
shall elaborate more on
her research, the necessary
medical breakthroughs for
advancement, the impor-
tance on fundraising and
awareness campaigns like
Movember, and what she
enjoys about her work.
Matt Loynes will also
be joining our Movem-
ber panel. Loynes has
suffered with mental
wellbeing in the past but
has since grown himself
a moustache and helps
raise awareness globally
about Movember, which
supports the life-saving
research that helped his
father beat cancer.
Finally, Nick Ellis;
a mental health coach
from JJ Ellis. He has
years of experience
delivering mental health
first aid training courses
to increase awareness,
challenge stigmas and dis-
crimination, and to give
people the confidence to
help someone in a crisis
The panel will be a
great chance to learn more
about Movember itself –
as well as to have any of
your questions answered.
It is great to get involved
in activities, and even
better to understand the

this month!
Later this month, ICU
