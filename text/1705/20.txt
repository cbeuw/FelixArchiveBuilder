Imagined Touch
A hell of a show
I
magine losing your
sense of sight. Then
imagine losing your
sense of hearing
too. What is it like to
inhabit a world of silence
and darkness? In their
immersive performance
piece Imagined Touch,
deafblind artists Heather
Lawson and Michelle
Stevens seek to open up to
audiences their world – a
world which most of us
have never even consid-
ered before.
The performance ac-
commodates perhaps 15
people at a time. We are
handed vision-obscuring
goggles and headphones
and shepherded down,
single file, into The Pit, a
performance space at the
Barbican. None of this
helps my sense of trepi-
dation. When Imagined
Touch first premiered
in Melbourne in 2016,
Lawson and Stevens spent
an hour with the audience
before the immersive
experience, telling stories
about themselves. Here,
we have only a short in-
troductory film featuring
the two artists.
“Before you enter our
world, you must learn its
rules,” says Stevens, “but
always know that you are
safe. You are safe.” I feel
oddly comforted by her
statement as I put on the
goggles and headphones.
Everything goes foggy
and the soundscape of
a busy train station fills
my ears. How frightening
would it be if my vision
remained like this perma-
nently? Surely no such
guarantee of safety exists
for the deafblind as they
go about their daily life.
Just as I muse this to
myself, someone takes
my hand and pulls me
onward. A threshold
appears beneath my feet
and I stumble gracelessly
across it into… an open
space? My guide leaves
me and I panic. Do I
dare take a step forward?
Shadowy figures brush
past me and I am tempted
to grab onto one of them
and ask for help. The
lights go out and my vision
changes from foggy white
to pitch blackness.
Invisible hands lead
me to a chair. A strange
sequence of taps and
strokes is signed into my
hand, and then a piece
of paper appears out of
nowhere. I touch it and
feel the rough texture. It
must spell something in
Braille, but I have no idea
how to read it, or if I am
even moving across the
paper in a straight line.
Which way is up? I’m
ashamed to admit I have
absolutely no idea people
communicate without
speech or sight.
I am passed from one
person to another and
danced around the room.
My confidence grows.
I even do a little twirl!
Finally, a rectangle is
drawn on my back and
fingers walk in a straight
line up it. Go through the
door, I think. Through
the goggles I sense dimly
a rectangle of darkness
in front of me, but I’m
scared to step through.
Suddenly, loud laughter
(is it mocking?) echoes
from behind me. Hands
grab me and pull me
through, confused, back
into reality.
Imagined Touch tries
its best to show audi-
ences what it’s like to
live life as a deafblind
person, and for the most
part succeeds. But the
20-minute installation
feels very short, and I’m
left vaguely disoriented,
with more questions than
answers. The soundscape
by Madeleine Flynn and
Tim Humphrey is beauti-
fully crafted – a busy train
station, the pitter-patter
of rain – but why not
silence, if we are meant
to be both deaf and blind?
How does tactile sign
language work? Some
sort of post-performance
discussion or even another
short film from Lawson
and Stevens would have
been appreciated. After
the (rather abrupt) ending
to the performance, my
primary feeling is one
of relief at rejoining the
world of the sighted. I’m
not entirely sure I’ve
gained much more insight
into what it’s like to be
deafblind.
The room at Jermyn
Street Theatre immediate-
ly transports the audience
one hundred years back
in time. Shelves crammed
with tools and ancient
military accessories, flags,
photographs, a big trunk,
a comfortable-looking
armchair, an upright
piano and the ever-present
bottles of brandy give life
to the stage. The feeling of
intimacy created by this
setting is enhanced by the
small number of seats and
the frequent incursions of
the actor to the stalls.
The piece itself is very
intimate: a two-man show
in first person, where
both actors play the same
character at different ages,
and constantly dialogue
with the audience. Right
from the start, Charles
Aitken as Billy Bishop
brilliantly conquers
everyone’s empathy with
his joyful portrait of youth
and energy. And Oliver
Beamish as the older Billy
Bishop provides a mature,
retrospective analysis of
thesamestories,whilealso
playing the piano accom-
paniment for the songs.
The pair work seamlessly
together, complementing
each other’s narratives.
Often they play additional
roles, giving the action
momentum and surpris-
ing the audience. I just
wished they were better
singers, but we can’t have
everything. What they
lacked in pitch, though,
was largely compensated
for by performing skills.
Subtle comic referenc-
es and witty remarks are
a constant throughout the
whole piece. Lighthearted
at first, the humour gets
increasingly dark, along
with the intensity of the
drama. In a remarkable
scene, a cabaret perform-
er sings joyfully about
several pilots: “Nope, he
didn’t survive...”
For a generation who
has never experienced
war, our approach to it
is often unrealistic and
naive. For us, like for
Billy, sometimes, “It
doesn’t seem like war at
all”. As such, the show
effectively explores the
enthusiasm of the young
soldier, who volunteers
to fight and leaves his
native Canada in search of
adventure. He later trans-
fers to the aviation branch
of the army, a highly
sought-after position,
to escape the mud and
boredom of the trenches.
His confrontation with the
rude cruelty of death and
survival is violent. We
accompany him through
the dark acceptance of
the reality of war and
his transformation into a
fearless hero, the high-
est-scoring pilot during
World War I.
There are truly
enchanting moments
throughout the piece. Just
to name a few: letters
to a longtime fiancée; a
priceless conversation
in the War Office; the
delight of a pilot learning
to fly; an action-packed
scene of aerial stunting
and shooting (yes, in
theatre!); the emotional
fragility of a human being
mourning his friends who
“ain’t supposed to die”; an
upper class lady’s disgust-
ed remarks on colonials’
manners; and more.
Billy Bishop Goes to
War is a powerful tale
of humanity. Through
laughter, powerful
emotions, and brilliant
performances, it has all
the ingredients for a mem-
orable evening!
Charles Aitken as Billy Bishop // Robert Workman
Trying to understand the deafblind world // Jeff Busby
A compelling and energetic tale of survival, Billy Bishop
Goes to War touches the deepest realities of the human
experience with humour and open honesty.
A thought-provoking piece that raises more questions
than it answers.
