I
t’s the return of your
favourite barcode
brandishing assassin
inthelatestinstalment
to the Hitman series; with
an all-new set of weapons
and costumes, Agent 47 is
better than ever. I can defi-
nitely tell you it’s better
than ever, having played
through several psychotic
rampages as a soda can
wielding madman dressed
in a fluorescent flamingo
outfit in some form of
twisted reincarnation of
Pepsi man.
Story:
After the mishaps that
took place in the last game,
and the veil being lifted
from Agent 47’s eyes con-
cerning the shadow client,
he continues to endeavour
to find out more about his
past whilst being assigned
contracts by Providence
to take down Providence
members who pose a
risk to the society. All the
while gathering informa-
tion on his former friend
and compatriot. Taking
down the members one
by one, you find yourself
more and more entrapped
in the ever-weaving web
that is the story of Agent
47’s past and what will
become of his future.
Gameplay:
Have you ever wanted
to murder a person by
a) simply shooting them
b) throwing them off a
building or c) dropping
a plastic shark on them?
Then you’re in luck, as
you have all of the above
available in just one
mission, with plenty of
wackier ways of killing
your target including
rigging a safety test for
a fighter jet to cause the
person to be ejected into
the air.
Worried you don’t have
the time or imagination
to think up the most
elaborate and crazy assas-
sinations to pull off? Have
no fear, the game provides
you with some story ob-
jectives for each different
mission. In essence, the
game guides you on how
to pull off elaborate plots,
such as getting a prototype
military robot to assas-
sinate the target for you.
While the game tells you
the gist of what you need
to do, you’re given some
freedom to complete the
objectives in any way
you see fit. The system is
intuitive and helps tell you
how to pull off all sorts
of crazy schemes with
unintuitive steps. All in
all, it’s a nice way to kill
creatively if you’re short
on time or don’t have the
imagination to think up
crazy schemes.
Because there are so
many ways to take down
your targets, this means
that all the missions, and
the game as a whole, has
great replay value. Each
mission has a galore of
different unique challeng-
es, such as assassinating
someone in their sleep,
stabbing in the shower
aka Alfred Hitchcock
style, and more. The game
doesn’t tell you how to
do the challenges, only
the end result; this means
you’re free to approach
and tackle them in any
way you want. Overall,
replaying missions feels
like a unique experience
every time, as opposed
to seeming like a chore
as with most games,
*cough* replaying
herding missions in
RDR2.
The game doesn’t stop,
with fun features like its
standalone sniper mode.
Situated at a vantage
point, you have to shoot
off targets at a distance
in all their ragdoll glory.
Even here, there are dif-
ferent challenges for you
to replay the mission and
play with different styles.
Unfortunately, there is
only one sniper mode
mission at the moment
which is a bit of let-down
as you’ll be eliminating
the same targets and
working with the same
scenery over and over
again. In addition to this,
some of the challenges
require very precise
timing and sharpshooting
which can test even the
most patient of gamers.
Despite its drawbacks,
sniper mode is still a
fun addition to the game
which contrasts from the
standard missions.
Unfortunately, I cannot
comment on the multi-
player aspect because
the onlines features were
not yet available in the
press copy of the game I
received.
The Verdict:
For those wanting a bit
more extra fun, Hitman 2
comes with an included
remaster of the previous
game built in for those
who owned the previous
game, or you’re given an
option of paying £15 for
the GOTY legacy pack,
which has a list of bene-
fits, including the pre-
vious game completely
remastered in the Hitman
2 engine.
Overall, Hitman 2 is
a very fun game and a
welcome addition to the
franchise. The intuitive
guidance system and
the ability to choose
the means of killing the
target helps makes the
experience an utter blast,
and gives you a more
than satisfactory choice
mechanism in a way that
Telltale games were never
able to master. Honestly,
it is worth dressing up as
a flamingo and throwing
soda cans at people to
knock them out, even if
the approach makes you
fail a few times. Seeing
your elaborate killing
schemes work out in the
end just makes this game
worth it.
In another addition to the Hitman series, Agent 47 returns, bringing with him years of tactical experience and a
galore of interesting but lethal tactics!
