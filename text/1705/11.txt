T
he TS Eliot Prize
in poetry is one of
the most prestig-
ious poetry prizes
for the English language.
Last year, to celebrate the
25th year of the prize,
the winner’s prize money
was increased to £25,000
- making it the most
valuable prize in British
poetry. It is no surprise
then that the prize is close-
ly watched by the rest of
the literary world, with
the winner announced on
14th January 2019.
This year’s shortlist is
‘intensely political’, says
Clare Pollard, one of the
three judges of this year’s
prize. Highlighting the
importance of words and
poetry in today’s political
discourse, Pollard said
that an engagement with
words is all the more
crucial in today’s culture
of fake news. Pollard,
along with fellow poets
and judges Sinéad Mor-
rissey (who chairs the
judges) and Daljit Nagra,
read a record 176 col-
lections of poetry before
settling on the final ten.
Previous winners of the
prize have included big
names like Ted Hughes,
Alice Oswald and Carol
Ann Duffy. This year,
the shortlist includes
established poets like
Sean O’Brien, a previous
winner of the prize, as well
as five debut collections,
making up an exciting
mix of contemporary
voices. Here are the ten
shortlisted collections:
Insistence by Ailbhe Darcy
This is the second
collection from the Irish
poet, and focuses on
themes of family, love and
home. A new child should
mean new hope, but what
if that is no longer true?
What happens when the
private word is threatened
by a public one? Darcy’s
collection is set in the
American Rust Belt, in
a time of climate change
and disenchantment.
Insistence examines the
parent’s responsibility to
her child, the poet’s re-
sponsibility to the reader
and the individual’s
responsibility in the face
of a global crisis. This
collection is a response to
troubled times.
American Sonnets for My
Past and Future Assassins
by Terrance Hayes
This collection, Hayes’
sixth, was written during
the first 200 days of
Donald Trump’s presi-
dency - one poem every
day. It is a sequence of
sonnets that tackles the
fast-moving news cycle
of American politics, an
immediate response to the
equally immediate and
changeable media politics
of Trump’s America.
Tracing the fault lines of
race, gender and political
oppression, this collection
of seventy poems touch on
everything thrown around
in American media and
politics, leaving no stone
unturned. Just as the tra-
ditional sonnet attempts
to express an inexpress-
ible love, Hayes’ poems
attempt to make sense of
one’s ties to a nation, in
disarmingly intimate but
masterful language.
Us by Zaffar Kunial
Kunial was born in
Birmingham to an English
mother and a Kashmiri
father, and now lives
in Hebden Bridge. The
differences between his
parents and his own up-
bringing make up part of
the ‘us’ that he examines
in his debut collection.
What does it mean to be
a human being seeking
belonging on this earth?
Kunial draws on different
lands and peoples, from
Kashmir, where his father
was born, to the Midlands,
where his mother grew up,
and even to the Orkneys
of her ancestors. He is the
acknowledged poster boy
of the Faber New Poets
scheme, and this first col-
lection heralds the arrival
of a striking new voice.
Feel Free by Nick Laird
Laird’sfourthcollection
shares a title with his wife,
Zadie Smith’s new essay
collection. While Smith
examines freedom in her
observations on reality,
Laird does it through his
masterful use of poetic
form, expressing feeling
by freeing up words.
Eleanor Stern writes in
The London Magazine:
‘few contemporary poets
can make old poetic
forms feel natural and
lyrical the way Laird can’.
And indeed, his poems
range from free verse to
villanelles, tackling issues
from Grenfell to the
refugee crisis.
The Distal Point
by Fiona Moore
Moore’s debut collec-
tion opens with a series
of elegies for her late
partner, who passed away
eleven years ago. Moore,
who used to work in
the Foreign Office, said
she left to write poetry
because she realised that
was what she would regret
not doing when she was
60. Her shortlist seems
to be validation of this
decision. The poems here
confront personal loss and
change, to more far-reach-
ing themes of European
history and the politics of
power.
Europa by Sean O’Brien
O’Brien’s earlier
collection The Drowned
Book won both the TS
Eliot and Forward Prizes
in 2015. Europa is his
ninth collection, and a
timely one. The poems in
this collection examine
our present crises in the
context of an imaginary
past, suggesting that our
futures will be determined
by what we make of
our European identity,
and what we choose to
remember and forget of
the continent’s shared
history.
Shrines of Upper Austria
by Phoebe Power
Power was a winner
of the Foyle Young Poets
in 2009, and Shrines of
Upper Austria, her debut
collection, won the 2018
Forward Prize for Best
First Collection. It is a
collage of stories and
histories, written from a
variety of perspectives,
ranging from that of an
Austrian woman who
married a British soldier,
to the voices of school-
children and immigrants,
cutting across lands and
languages.
Soho by Richard Scott
Scott’s first collection
takes an intimate, nuanced
and uncensored look at
gay identity and culture.
In contrast to the cor-
porate, family-friendly,
shopping-mall depictions
of gay freedom, Soho
confronts the multiple
facets of gay identity
- including the shame,
intimacy, desire and
violence inherent to the
gay experience.
Wade in the Water
by Tracy K Smith
Smith is not a new
name in poetry - this is her
fourth collection, and Life
on Mars won the Pulitzer
Prize. In 2017, she was
named Poet Laureate of
the US. This collection
takes its title from a
spiritual, a type of song
sung on the underground
railroad that carried slaves
to safety in the 19th
century, and its poems are
a patchwork of the voices
and stories of slaves and
their owners.
Three Poems
by Hannah Sullivan
Yet another debut
collection, Three Poems
is an intimate collection,
touching on sex, giving
birth, death, but also
beauty and nature. Her
words tread lightly, and
shed new light onto old
subjects.
