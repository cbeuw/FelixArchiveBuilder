This week, your
ChemEng children ask
for your help with their
Heat and Mass Transfer

remembers any of that
shit - it’s all about fintech
now.

FELIX
HANGMAN negafelix@imperial.ac.uk
This week you get an
e-mail about Union
Council. You’re confused,
how does Council
represent people if people
don’t even give a shit
about Council?
This week, someone on
your Geology course
stole your favourite
colouring pencils.
They were Faber Castell!
How are you going to
shade in your rocks
now?!
This week you complete
the puzzle section on
time and send in your
solutions. Unfortunately
it was 4 minutes after the
deadline so your score
was capped at 40%.
College policy - soz.
This week you start
scoping out the shops
for Black Friday deals.
Not even an empty bank
account will stop you -
you live by faith and not
by sight.
This week you get lost
at night in Huxley and
accidentally stumble into
a SciFi - KinkSoc collab
event.
.
This week you’re stuck
in the broken Woodward
lift with your flatmate
who you suspect doesn’t
shower. Not the kind of
close relationship you
were hoping for at uni.
This week you’re Union
President.
Who said this was hard?
All you need to do is
copy your girlfriend’s
notes.
This week you’re the
Interfaith Officer. You’re
not sure how you’re
meant to promote faith
groups in a place so
devoid of hope.
This week you find a
dead mouse in your
vegetarian halloumi wrap
from the library cafe.
You’re horrified -you
thought it was a new
improved recipe they
were testing
This week on firms, you
piss off an elderly woman
with your enthusiasm.
She decides to rearrange
your face with her
walking stick.
This week you’re chair of
FemSoc. You feel Alice
Gast is being unfairly
targeted. Then you
remember that you’re in
overdraft and she gets
to fly first class on your
fees. You get over it.

Dear Felicity,
I have a horrible secret that some of my friends
have just discovered: my most played song of
all time is Mi Gente. If more people find out, I’m
concerned my reputation will be ruined forever.
I don’t know how it happened. I guess it was my
bop for a little while and I’d listen to it first thing
in the morning, but really most played of ALL
TIME? I’d accept a pop song if it were a classic,
bit this is just washed up and not even edgy.
What do I do?
Yours,
Asha Med

Hi Asha,
That sounds like quite
the predicament, but I do
think you are right to feel
badly about this. What
self-respecting human
listens to that song more
than once? If we were
friends oustside of this
exchange, trust that would
swiftly change once I
found this out about you.
I wouldn’t be able to
value your judgement
about anything. You
should prepare for the
consequences this will
have on all aspects of your
life. Have you considered
what might happen if
potential employers got
wind of this?! There isn’t
heaps I can do, but what
I can advise you on is
damage control. How
about a cover story?
Maybe you were taking a
bachata class and perfect-
ing your dance routine?
Or you were trying to
learn some Spanish? It
still isn’t cool, but maybe
it will help chill the burn
a little.
I can also offer you
some words of comfort:
nothing will ever be more
embarassing than this
and the only way is up.
You have nothing to lose
now, and everything to
gain. With all my love and
support (but none of my
respect)
Big luv,
Felicity
