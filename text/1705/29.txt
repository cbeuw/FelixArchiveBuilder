U
S crude oil
prices entered
a bear market
[defined as a
20% drop from a recent
high] on Thursday as
concerns of tight global
supplies eased. This
follows Washington al-
lowing eight countries to
continue buying Iranian
crude, softening the blow
of new international
sanctions on the nation.
In addition to this the
US Energy Information
Administration’s weekly
inventory report last
Wednesday showed
that US domestic crude
stockpiles have increased
for a seventh week to
432m barrels, the most
since June. Consequently,
many investors see this
as a sign that concerns
over abundancy of oil
reserves diminishing and
the buying pressure of
this commodity reducing.
As a result of this, com-
modity traders such as
Warren Patterson of IGN,
believe “Price weakness
has raised the prospect
of OPEC reversing their
recent policy of producing
as much as they can, to
one where they show
more restraint”. As ex-
pected, on Monday Saudi
Arabia opened the door to
cutting crude production
(despite Russia saying
that an excess of supply is
short term, putting these
two big oil producers at
odds), causing a jump in
oil by 2%. Khalid al Falih,
the kingdoms energy min-
ister, said the state energy
giant SaudiAramco would
supply 500,000 fewer
barrels a day in December
compared with November
due to lower demand. It
was only earlier this year
that Saudi Arabia targeted
an increase in production
of 1 million barrels a day
because of the pressure of
the Trump administration,
who called on the OPEC
nations to fill the void after
Iranian sanctions depleted
world supply. However,
as Trump granted waiv-
ers to big customers of
Iran such as India and
China, fears arose about
oversupply. Despite what
analysts at consultancy
FGE forecasting a drop in
Iranian oil supply of 1.3
million barrels per day in
the next six months, as
Brian Hook, US special
representative for Iran,
said on Monday that there
would be further sanctions
as “our goal remains get-
ting countries to zero over
time”. One key metric
is the fact that hedge
funds have gone from
being bullish on crude oil
earlier in 2018 to sharply
reducing their positions
in the past few weeks,
indicating that many are
betting that the cycle has
turned, although some an-
alysts believe that if more
barrels are cut from Iran
than currently expected,
funds will rush back into
the market adding fuel to
any rally.
What is also important
to note as a direct conse-
quence of falling crude
prices is that it caused
a sell-off in high yield
energy bonds. The last
sell-off in 2014 with a
14% decline in oil prices,
more than 100 energy
companies went bankrupt.
It is true though that the
forces driving the oil
prices lower are different
in 2018 than 2014 and
more importantly the
fundamental quality of
high yield issuers has
improved, making the
recent drop in oil prices
less troubling. The fact is
that energy is one of the
most attractive sectors for
high income investors,
due to the fact that spreads
have yet to reflect the
fundamental problems of
the industry. The spread
on energy bonds on
November 8th was 432
basis points, compared
to 335 basis points for
the rest of the high-yield
market.
T
he Economist
has called them
“an addiction
to corporate
cocaine.” Reuters has
called them “self-canni-
balization.” The Financial
Times has called them “an
overwhelming conflict of
interest.” In an article that
won the HBR McKinsey
Award for the best article
of the year, Harvard
Business Review has
called them “stock price
manipulation.” These in-
fluential journals make a
powerful case that whole-
sale stock buybacks are a
bad idea—bad economi-
cally, bad financially, bad
socially, bad legally and
bad morally. Yet despite
these powerful denunci-
ations, stock buybacks
not only continue but are
happening at a larger scale
than ever seen before.And
this raises the question
of why, how, what, who,
when and where?
To answer a few of
these questions, let’s first
see what share buy backs
are. Share buy backs are
when a company that
issued the shares repur-
chases the shares back
from its shareholders.
During a buyback, the
company pays sharehold-
ers the market value per
share. With a buyback,
the company can purchase
stocks on the open market
or from its shareholders
directly. Share buybacks
are a popular method for
returning cash to share-
holders.
Why do companies
do them? This can be
for multiple reasons. For
mammoth companies like
Apple which are sitting
on a huge pile of cash
reserve ($250 billion),
carrying this amount
of equity capital on the
balance sheet becomes
more of a burden than a
blessing, as shareholders
demand returns on their
investments in the form of
dividends which is a cost
of equity.The business is
essentially paying for the
privilege to access funds
it isn’t using. Buying
back some or all of the
outstanding shares can
be a simple way to pay
off investors and reduce
the overall cost of capital.
These huge buybacks not
only preserve the value of
the stocks but also boost
them as it drives an influx
of investors.
On next week’s article,
we will continue to
examine benefits of share
buybacks but also see
why they are unpopular
and even seen by some as
stock price manipulation.
