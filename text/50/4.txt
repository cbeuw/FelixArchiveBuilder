HISTORY
The present "Bo" i s the second of an i l l u s t r i o u s
l i n e of Guilds' mascots. The f i r s t was a Rover which
appeared at the back of Guilds i n 1919. I t was a regu-
l a r entry i n the Brighton Run, u n t i l i n '33, the R.A.C.
became more s t r i c t about dates. The Rover was fixed
at 1905, so he was out. Nevertheless he took part i n
a number of rags. In 1934 he was l e f t outside 1C
Downing Street containing en effigy of Ramsey Kacdonald
holding an outsize b i s c u i t - t h i s being i n commemmora.ticn
of Lord Iiacfarlr.nd's g i f t of a new Rolls Rovce to the
f i r s t La.bout P.M.
The Rover finished h i s days chugging round the
Crystal Palace Race Track, announcing events during the
intervals. '.Vher. the war came and the army took over
the Palace, Bo. I disappeared
Bo. I I , A7/33, was bought, reputedly for £40, In
-.Shropshire by the late John Garland, who ran i t for a
few years and then handed i t ove* to F. J Pidgeon, who
l a t e r stored i t at h i s home i n Rickmansworth u n t i l the
end of the war. Bo had many Veteran Car Club rune,
ana raced at Brooklands, lapping the old "Mountain"
•course at 29 n.p.h.
Bo was made by Messrs. James and Brown, Hammer-
smith, i n 1901. Only one other car made by t h i s firm,
•a 'C4 model, i s known to exist. Last year, at the
end of the Brighton Run, the "Bo" team had the pleasure
of meeting Colonel Brown, the designer, who was highly
delighted to see h i s product of 51 years ago s t i l l going
well.
The days-between '01 and '34 are uncertain, but,
"Bo" was bought from a blacksmith, near Much Venlock,
Salop, being then a dirty grey and black. He also had
s o l i d tyres, but these were replaced by special: old
crock pneumatics i n '37.
