slowly u n t i l i n i t s second year F e l i x found i t s feet with
an 8000 word, s i x page paper with a c i r c u l a t i o n of over

the projected expansion of"the College, the next f i f t y -

confidently look forward t o a doubled circulation., a

whatever happens we want F e l i x to remain i t s independent
and insonciant self*.

VIEWPOINT
D O W N W I T H F E L I X ?
Dear S i r ,
Once again U.L U. have decided to f o i s t t h e i r wret-
ched newspaper upon us, and they time with a l l the auda-
c i t y of new born pups they calmly suggest that " F e l i x " ,
together with various other college newspapers should
quietly ceaso publication to make way for a "greater
cause". Just l i k e that; no fuss or bother, just pack
up and go, and give dear old Uncle U.L.l*. some elbow
room •
How long w i l l i t take U.L.U. to r e a l i z e that stu-
dents don't want to read the kind of news that U.L-C.
would l i k e then t c read. The " F e l i x " correspondent
asserts that we do not hear enough about Senate house;
t h i s nay be true, but i t does not need a U.L.U. news-
paper to remedy t h i s situation. I consider that any
U.L.U. newspaper would inevitably contain paragraphs
upon paragraphs about Union "policy" and Union "plans".
How t h i s may be a l l for the good of cur souls, but I
think that most sttidents vcnld rather have t h i s sort
of news relegated to a .small column i n a hinder page.
To quote from the I.C.'.'. Handbook "Felix reports College
a c t i v i t i e s , . . end -oilier news of interest to students.
F e l i x i s a lighthearted animal., but he can be serious;
ho has no axe to grind save the interests of the College,
and i s p o l i t i c a l l y independent".
F e l i x s e l l s w e l l i n I.C. because he i s a lighthear-
ted. animal, not because he prints columns about Senate
House and Woburn Square. In other words, I believe
that even i f a l l college newspapers did close down to
make way for a U.L.U. paper, that paper would never
entirely capture t h e i r c i r c u l a t i o n . London University
i s too widely scattered for students to display any more
than a minimum amount of interest i n the a c t i v i t i e s o f
students from other colleges.
However, t h i s does not mean that F e l i x should not
contain any University nevjs at all} h a l f a page an issue
could be devoted" to Varsity Hews, preferably i n the form
of a b r i e f summary. A report contained i n a few lines
would probably be appreciated more than i t s long-winded
cousin. Please don't l e t us have any more h i g h f a l u t i n
ideas about 'graciously giving way to a greater cause';
let us be s e l f i s h for once and think about I.C. rather
than U.L.U.

The U. L. Union i s organizing a Gala F e s t i v a l on
the 25th June, to be held i n the F e s t i v a l Gardens i n aid
of charities. Those who were present last year w i l l
need no further encouragement to participate. A
, procession w i l l start from Hyde Park at about 2,45, and
go by way of Clapham Common (tea here) to enter Batter-
sen Gardens at about 6.30.
Highlights of the evening include an all-student
Revue, demonstrations on the lawn by Bobby Locke, stunts
in the boating lake, a famous magician's performance,
and crowning of the Carnival Queen. I t i s hoped to leave
the gardens at about 11 for a bonfire and dancing for ft
while. Further d e t a i l s w i l l bs posted i n the Union
l a t e r on, and w i l l also be published i n the U.L. Rag
Magazine 'LULU'., Handbills for d i s t r i b u t i o n amongst
the public w i l l also be issued-

' The U.L. Literary Society, encouraged as also a
l i t t l e i r r i t a t e d by the success of the Oxford and Cam-
bridge ventures, have decided t o bring out an annual
anthology of L.U. poetry. I t w i l l be a 'digest' of a l l
the poetry printed i n the College Magazines i n the pre-
ceding year. The price i s to be I s . or I s . Sd. and i t
w i l l come out at the beginning of each session.
King's College won the U.L.U. debating championship
and the motion i n proposing "An infant i s happier i n i t s
infancy than an adult i n adultery".
Wye College, t h e i r opponents, offered themselves as
personal witnesses f o r the opposition; and gave most o f
the Constantino arguments f o r King's to oppose on i r r e l e -
vant moral grounds which King's had presumably retained
from t h e i r inhibited infancies. The house passed the
motion by 18 votes t o 13. (The four abstainers confes-
sed experience only of infancy).
