The Road Test of Boanerges The Great (described
last torn by Royalty as "an amazing contraption) was
carried out on 20th t'.ay in the presence of a multitude
of adr.drers, after an even larger multitude had desperccd,
tired of waiting•
Acceleration tests were performed, motor cycle
escorts being ased to record the speeds reached, while
stci watches (by courtesy of T.C.A.C ) indicated the
ti-os. An unfortunate tendency on the part of the crowd
to Bpreaa across Prince Consort Road almost lead to ,
severe accidents. On one occasion when the crowd partedj
to let Bo through at 28 m.p.h. i t was seen that there
were several cars i n the centre of the road, right in
Bo"s path- He swerved and avoided them.
An interesting competition: an acceleration test
0-5 m.p.h. between Bo and J . Edward Taylor (1949 Triumph
500). Bo won easily.
A number of regular Bo drivers were present, as
well as several learners, and the opportunity was taken
of holding the Boy Drivers Championship. This was in
two parts, the f i r s t being a Le Mans Start, in which the
driver and co-driver had to run across Prince Consort
Road with the"starting handle, start Bo who was on the
other side, and drive back to t h e i r original position.
Fart two1
of the Championship was a circuit- of the. Albert
Hall, this being a test of steering and accurate speed
judgement. I spoke to the winning co-driver, Mr. Jasper
A s p i n a l l , hot.and flushed a.fter his victory. I offered
him a cigarette. "No thank you." he said,_"T dpnH
smoke very often, but whsn I do I'm choosy."
After the Road Test, the Motor Club took Bo round
Hyde Park and to Buckingham Palace, to give the learners
some experience. A correspondent reports:
"The roundabout in front of the Palace seemed to
delight Bo, and very few pedestrian casualties were
incurred on the second time round.
"The Hall had made a stout effort to be worthy of
the honour now being bestowed upon i t and here the gen-
eral ovation nearly drowned the noise of Bo and h i s
horn, but not quite.
"Nelson's column took the unaccustomed vibration
of earth and ether very well. One tribal chief from
the upper Congo, however, mistook a Bo gear change for
the mortal cry of a wounded hippopotamus, and was last
seen sharpening his teeth on the National Gallery r a i l -
ings."

U.L. NEWSPAPER.
In continuation of the press conference held in the
vac, student editors met the U.L.U. president again on
Friday 22nd. The reports of the four main College
papers - Pi, King's N
e
w
,
s
, Beaver and Felix - were heard.
The tone of these reports was cautiously optimistic with
the exception of Beaver (L.S.E.), which was definitely
enthusiastic about the idea of restarting the "Univer-
sity,".
Background: The f i r s t U.L. paper f a i l e d lor want
of staff. The second one failed for want of support -
that was two years ogo. This time i t i s expected to
get starting sales of 5000, and more later when the paper
settles down.
Plans: The paper i s to be about "Evening Standard"
size, eight pages of newsprint, price 1-M- or 2d-
Reporters and sales managers w i l l be appointed i n each
of the constituent Colleges, while the offices w i l l be
,in or about the U.L.U. building. The E d i t o r i " l Board
w i l l consist of an Editor, a sub-editor, the news, sport
and features aditors and the Business Manager. The
business side w i l l be handled largely by professional
people, and w i l l look after advertising, p r i n t i n g , cir-
culation, block-making etc •
Preliminary surveys regarding the cost of printing
and d i s t r i b u t i o n , contacts with advertising agencies etc.
are going ahead, and the results will be known in about a
fortnight. The Colleges in the meanwhile have been
asked to enlist the necessary support, to find people
willing to do jobs on the editorial and the sales sides,
and i n general in the words of the U.L. Prosident Alan
Tate, to spread the glad tidings.

An amusing i n c i d e n t occurred a t the annual
Holland Club versus S e l k i r k H a l l c r i c k e t match at
Harllngton l a s t week. A member o f the Holland
Club was h a t t i n g , and was struck on the t h i g h by a
b a l l d e l i v e r e d by Graham (Get-em) Gales. A p u f f
of smoke rose from the unfortunate batsman's
pocket. With c h a r a c t e r i s t i c B r i t i s h phlegm he
went on b a t t i n g while a match box i n h i s pocket
burned m e r r i l y . However, he was persuaded by
h o r r i f i e d witnesses to remove i t and i t was seen
that a l l the matches had exploded, singeing h i s
pocket s l i g h t l y . This s t o r y i s quite above board,
and w i l l be supported at any time by the Captain
of the S e l k i r k Sloggers, John, Duke of E l l i n g t o n
(3 C i v i l e ) , who has acquired n o t o r i e t y owing to
his p e r s i s t e n c e i n t e l l i n g i t .
