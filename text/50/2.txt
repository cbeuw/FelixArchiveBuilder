the Shrtertainments Committee has i t s annual begin-
nings, on that obscure Old Lounge notice-board which
seems better f i t t e d for the times of Service and Holy
Communion than for the election notices of such temporal
posts as I.C. Entertainments. I t i s surprising to find
that I.C. has had an Entertainment Committee for only a
few years. Who ran the hops and organized the Commem.
Ball i n the pre-I.C.E.C. days? The Comittee has a big
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y , for they are i n charge of the one phase
of Union a c t i v i t y in which a majority of the College take
part. It i s only at the hops for instance, that many
students have an opportunity of meeting people outside
t h e i r own year. Apart from running the President's and
Oomnsa. B a l l s members of the Committee are present,
looking after t h * mike or amplifier, at a l l Carnivals,
Club dances and Debates etc. i n which t h e i r e l e c t r i c a l
equipment i s used. In the summer a dance i s held by
the Committee for overseas students who are i n England
doing vac. work.
This year they have the considerable task of arrang-
ing a Coronation B a l l which w i l l certainly be the biggest
land, i t i s hoped, the best function ever held i n the
Union. In the p u b l i c i t y and the t i c k e t s , the Committee
have already shown imagination and care, which augurs
w e l l for the B a l l i t s e l f .
C,J.HORRISS.
Kit Morriss was born i n Somerset i n 1929 and spent
his early childhood i n Malaya. He returned to England
and was educated at Oundle School. His experiences on
a course at the Outward Bound Sea School caused him to
choose the Army for h i s National Service, where he became
2nd/Lt. and served with the Sappers in Egypt. In 1950
he f i r s t set h i s foot into the C i v i l Engineering Depart-
ment at Guilds. His childhood voyaging has l e f t him
with a love of t r a v e l ; a love which has been f u l f i l l e d
for K i t has hitch-hiked and worked h i s way across most
of W. Europe. Swedish farms, Spanish Railways and
French rebuilding have a l l received his attention. He
once even worked i n England - dustman at the F e s t i v a l .
Kit became Chairman by sheer bad luck. A late
nominee for the Committee he was elected Secretary, then
Chairman and three Committee members f a i l e d to return so
Kit was elected Chairman at the beginning of the session.
He has run cross-country - played squash for I.C.
but only when the could find no-one else - he says.
His l i k e s , obviously headed by Travelling (and the
associated pleasures), include Erie Linklater and Van
Gogh. His d i s l i k e s are few but vehement - pictures of
flowers and people who conduct loud Bridge post-mortems
in a quiet Union Lounge.
He has been quotedas saying either "Gorgeous women
are a nuisance". or "Women are a gorgeous nuisance"
which he actually said i s uncertain.'
I.W. JOFFE
I. W. Joffe was born i n Johanesburg i n 1930 and i s
the son of an old Guilds-man. At King Edward VII
School i n Jo 'burg he played the f i r s t of h i s selection
of sports - rugger. At Rhodes University College where
he studied economics he played hockey. In 1949 he came
to England to take the Intermediate Year at I.C. and i s
now i n the 3rd year C i v i l Engineering. At Guilds he
gained h i s colours for rowing but now pushed h i s car
for exercise. He w i l l be returning to S. A f r i c a t h i s
summer with the Trans-continental expedition. His
chief interests number three. Two show roots i n S.
A f r i c a the t h i r d i s Universal. They are - Modern
Architecture, Racial P o l i t i c s and Drama Students.
THE REST OF THE COMMOTEE
Janet Findlater i s the only lady member of the
Committee. Her nimbleness as disc-jockey at the hops
i s only surpassed by her s k i l l on the A t h l e t i c F i e l d .
When at school, i n Slough, Janet won the A l l
England Schools long-jump championship and since she
entered the Botany Department i n 1951 has run and jumped
with great success for I.C. snd U.L.U. At the Inter
Varsity sports at Birmingham recently she broke the
ladies long jump record. Her interests natually include
a l l forms of exercise end unusally Janet has an interest
i n Campanology and musical Instruments.
Maurice Anthony Champney came to R.C.S. with a
Royal Studentship i n 19 49 and i n 1952 collected a 2nd
Class i n Chemistry. He i s now doing research i n a
lab. w e l l known for i t s 'atmosphere". M.A.C. entered
Union a f f a i r s i n 1951 when he was co-opted as Dance
Secretary. He has served again t h i s year i n t h i s post
and i s responsible for the technical side of the work.
His interest i n dai cing rises considerably higher than
a "hop-shuffle" for he has been elected Hon. Sec. of the
Dancing Club f o r next session. Indeed he loves to have
someone i n h i s arms - h i s hobby i s Judo.
Mike Rich entered I.C. i n 1951 but has an insatiable
interest i n the 1st year course. Mike i s another of the
Entertainments Committee who has strong connections
abroad. He was born i n Mertola (Portugal) and came to
England i n 1939 to be educated at M i l l H i l l School.
Somewhere i n t h i s l i f e spent h a l f i n Portugal and h a l f
i n England Kike Rich has acquired the somewhat unusual
habit of wearing three pullovers throughout the year.
It may have been h i s love of motor-cycling that started
i t .
Brian Wyatt also had schooling abroad - i n Cairo
and Aberdeen. He entered I.C. i n 1951 to study Ento-
mology after wasting two yes.rs i n the R.A.F. as a Radar
Instructor. He has held the posts of Assistant Hon.
Secretary to the Social Clubs Committee and Hon. Sec.
of the R.C.S. Boat Club and i s ually seen and heard at
College Debates. llext year he w i l l tread the l i g h t fan-
t a s t i c with Maurice Champney, as President of the Dancing
Club.He l i k e s Music, Opera, Theatre and Dancing. Brian
i s also the only expert on Salvadore D a l i on the Coramit-
* e e ,
H e d i s l i k e s record request programmes; people who
c a l l spiders insects and having to u n r o l l h i s umbrella.
The E d i t o r Emeritus.
THE SEVEN AGES OF WOMAN
L i k e man's, a woman's ages number seven
Before her o r b i t shapes i t s course to Heaven.
The f i r s t , unconscious, I n a b l i s s f u l state
She wends a t r a n q u i l way through Cow and Sate,
And l i k e dear Granny (mumbling i n her chair)
She doesn't know h e r age, and doesn't oare.
The second now; with f a t and s t i c k y f i n g e r
She hunts to f i n d what Santa Glaus w i l l b r i n g 'er
She has her p r i v a t e k n i f e , and spoon, and cup
And l i k e s the world to t h i n k that she's grown up.
The t h i r d , the s c h o o l g i r l clad i n blouse and s l i p ,
S p i t t i n g at a l l the boys, and l e a r n i n g how to skip.
But see poor Mother v a i n l y t r y , once more,
To t e l l the busman t h a t she's only f o u r .
The f o u r t h , embedded deep i n paint and p l a s t e r
She looks quite opposite f r o m an Old Master;
And f o r a s e c r e t purpose none can glean
She t e l l s her boy f r i e n d that she's seventeen.
The f i f t h age next; she sports a golden r i n g ,
Brave symbol of her s k i l l i n bargaining.
And though she i s not f a r advanced i n l i f e ,
"Much olde r than her t e e t h , " says Brother's wife.
The s i x t h soon f a l l s , and time i s g e t t i n g l a t e ,
But b i r t h d a y s stopped when she was t h i r t y eight.
The seventh now, and Granny's looking f i n e .
(You wouldn't t h i n k that ehe was eighty n i n e ) .
The seventh gone; how sad the sombre day
When Granny, i n her n i n e t i e s , passed away.
And Xldeat Daughter (who i s g e t t i n g on)
T e l l s the r e p o r t e r , " d i e d , aged s i x t y one".
A.R. Bray
So r,.Ui is, f i f t y issues old, coming, I hope, hrlo the prime
of i t s existence, l'hose who were at college on the day when
from the l i t t e r of umpteen hostel rooms there emerged a very
scruffy k i t t e n , looking l i k e a l l other k i t t e n s , i t s eyes
gumed up, i t s fur puffed up l i k e a young chicken, taking very
short steps on such unsteady legs. A bundle of mischief.No
wonder that we a l l loved i t and took to i t at once. How we
laughed at i t s fir'st wild springs chasing leaves blown by the
wind or ideas which as quickly whisked away. How eagerly we
awaited the next appearance t c see v/hat scrape i t had got into.
I t was not very Jong before t h i s c r t could get -round very
nicely by i t s e l f ; i t stayed out at nights, changed i t s coat,
began lo have regular habits. In fret i t began to grow up,
passing through a period when i t was very self-conscious, each
editor taking himself rather seriously, but not for long.
Good 8: i r i t s , i r r e p r e s i b l e humour, and the desi*e to look
into every milkbottle and mousehole, including the refectory
kitchens, kept i t running very sanely on the whole, perhaps
too sanely. I t s publio became c r i t i c a l of i t s habits, and
wanted them changed. They were changed but the great sporting
I.C. publiodid not lay 10 to 1 on F e l i x . Although i t t r i e d
yer y hard to maintain popularity, i t s habit of scratching
[those of whom i t did not approve met with quite a sales r e s i s -
tance. However, a l l those troubles are now over, and F e l i x ,
becoming a l i t t l e too tinsponianeous, a l i t t l e too much l i k e
daily newspaper, (the standard brioks hurled at regular i n -
tervals to keep the cat jumping) i s now w e l l fed and cared
for, established on the best oushion i n the Union.
S4 i t has grown from the wee thing that could hardly raise
a b i t of f l u f f from an IOTA jumper to a cat that w i l l l i f t i t s
t a i l on anybody's doorstep. Let us hope that l i k e i t s pre-
nomer i t w i l l keep walking- and w a l k i n g — and l i k e Kipling's,
by i t s e l f , no strings and no oat-towing to the prophet that
i s said to be existing i n the East. Keep walking and the best
of luck.
I hear i t rumoured that London has gone to great expense to
stage a procession to celebrate the occasion!
As I've not written waffle for so long — although I t r i e d
land t r i e d nothing worthwhile has resulted-I'm very sorry. But
lyou have my congratulations for the f i r s t half century well
run and best wishes for the second half.
Greetings to a l l those who suffered me, there must be some
