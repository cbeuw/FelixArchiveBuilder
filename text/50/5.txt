Shaw s u b t i t l e d t h i s p l a y "A p o l i t i c a l extrava-
gansa". I t s u f f e r s from that ogre of the theatre
the I n d e f i n i t e conclusion. But i t i s not, as man;
o f h i s l a t e r p l a y s tend to be, merely a p l a t f o r m
f o r i n c i s i v e comment on the ways of the world.
The time i s the future, and i n such a future the
r o y a l f a m i l y i s no longer content to c h r i s t e n t r a -
d i t i o n a l l y : nor i s i t alone i n t h i s respect f o r
we have Balbus and Boanerges and L y s i s t r a t a amongsi
a host of odd sounding c h r i s t i a n names to add to
the fantasy.
One might have expected the r o y a l household tc
have rushed ahead i n t o a f u t u r i s t i c p a t t e r n - but
nol The decor i s t r a d i t i o n a l l y ornamental, and
the dress, save f o r Boanerges' most amusing 'uni-
form of labour', p r a c t i c a l l y normal. A great
p i t y , s i n c e there i s scope f o r imaginative design
here.
The p a r t i c u l a r apple c a r t which i s c o n s t a n t l y
i n danger o f upset i s the c o n s t i t u t i o n a l monarchy.
King Magnus, played by Noel Coward s u p r l s i n g l y
e f f e c t i v e l y considering the p a r t i s by no means h i e
usual type, i s beset by a squabbling cabinet o f
humbugs, l e d by Proteus, (Laurence Naismith), a
booring, short tempered l i t t l e man, who cannot s i t
s t i l l f o r more than a few moments, and who keeps
c o n t r o l , such as i t i s , l a r g e l y by threatening to
r e s i g n . Admittedly he has a p r e t t y tough job - he
has two women i n h i s cabinet, as w e l l as the new-
comer Boanerges, "behind whose naive awkwardness
l i e s a wealth of i n i t i a t i v e . Magnus has a very
a c t i v e mind, but as king he must keep h i s views
l a r g e l y unexpressed. He sees the p o l i t i c a l set
are r u i n i n g h i s country (no wonder, f o r i n t h i s un-
happy England only seven per cent o f the voters go
to the p o l l s ) : but instead of g i v i n g him freedom
to act, Proteus demands that he s i g n away the
v e s t i g e s of h i s power. A p r e t t y problem, which
Magnus solves i n a d r a m a t i c a l l y i r o n i c a l manner.
O r i n t h i a , the king's mistress, deserves much
more mention that I can reasonably a l l o t .
Margaret Leighton plays the p a r t to p e r f e c t i o n , and
tier provocative g u i l e forms an i n t e r e s t i n g contrast
to the matronly queen. The boudoir i t s e l f , l a v i i i -
l y c u r t a i n e d and s u i t a b l y furnished i n grand s t y l e ,
forms the background to the i n t r i g u i n g t u s s l e
between O r i n t h i a and Magnus - a spectacle i n
i t s e l f . Over and over they r o l l , and one f e e l s
that they must soon tumble i n t o the orchestra.
But as usual there i s a knock on the door, a r a p i d
r e o r i e n t a t i o n to d i g n i t y , and calm ensues a f t e r a
g l o r i o u s scamper.
We axe not feasted yet however. Shaw has one
more morsel to o f f e r i n the form o f the A m e r i c a n
'proposal to r e u n i t e the U.S.A. t o the B r i t i s h
Empire. C e c i l Trouncer c a r r i e s o f f the part o f
American ambassador with e n t h u s i a s t i c g e n i a l i t y ,
and gives an amusing, c h a r i c a t u r e , accent included,
o f the confident, souless American. His super-
f i c i a l l y emotional 'I was born i n the shadow of Ely
Cathedral' l e f t me c h i l l e d .
S i n g u l a r l y enough, Shaw does manage to i n s e r t
i n t o t h i s fantasy a comment on science, f o r Magnus
laments:
"The s c i e n t i s t s w i l l have nothing to do
with us, f o r the atmosphere of p o l i t i c s
i s not the atmosphere of science."
But need i t f o l l o w that while a community advances
• b r i l l i a n t l y i n matters s c i e n t i f i c , i t tends to
stand s t i l l as f a r as s o c i a l and p o l i t i c a l organ-
i s a t i o n are concerned?" R.B.

The fourth number of the annual Guilds' Engineer i 3
• now on sale (2s. 6d. to students; 5s- others), and is
well worth buying. I t i s written i n such a manner that
practically everything can be easily understood by^a non-
speoialist, the only exception being on article on"
polynomial solving using an electrolytic trough - and.
this oould not easily have been simplified. A short,
fascinating account of speech research and sn article on
the new wind tunnel are among the other features.
As an account of work being done in Guilds', this
magazine is far more illuminating than any prospectus
could pdssibly be. Congratulations to a l l concerned.

The annual I.C.P.S. Exhibition was held a fortnight
.ago. - .Vhile the standard of most of the work submitted
was inexceptional, your reporter wa3 greatly impressed
by some exhibits by a Past President, Col. Bull. These
were very l i k e lithographs, but with an elusive texture
which suggested the sort of thing that Seurat might have
dene i n monochrome. A view of the South Bank Festival
Site was particularly impressive. One had the feeling
that here the oamera was contributing to art. In con-
trast th» deserts of mountains, side streets and heads
which formed the greater parti of the exhibition were
uninspired.
J.S. was q u i t e a oharaeter. He was a l s o
quite an e y e f u l l . He was t a l l i e h , s i l a v i s h , and
had a t t r a o t i v e h a i r , f a s e i n a t i n g eyes, and a good
share of sex appeal (which, of eourae, i s j u s t as
important i n males as femalesi) He a l s o had a
considerable P e r s o n a l i t y Quotient, whleh soon made
i t s e l f evident, and he was on some eoramittee or
other e a r l y i n h i s f i r s t year at I.C., and he was
popular on the sports f i e l d . He wasn't muoh of a
one f o r the a r t s , but he d i d write a few l e t t e r s - 1
to-the-editor when he was p a r t i c u l a r l y roused, and;
he was a good debater and c o n v e r s a t i o n a l i s t . In
general, then, he was looked up to as an acknowledged
leader i n s e v e r a l o i r o l e s . and was quite an asset
to the C o l l e g e .
Why "was'*? Because J.S. was asked not to
resume his eourse t h i s session - he was chucked out.
I don't t h i n k he shirked h i s work, although he
didn't seem t o be a l l out f o r a " f i r s t * ' , and h i s
P r a c t i c a l was not above the average. He was one
of those who j u s t couldn't make the grade. Why
l i d I c a l l him "T.S."? Beoause he might be any-
body, so he became John Smith. He i s t y p i c a l
because about a quarter of the f i r s t year entrants
to I.C. are thrown out eaoh year, and i t i s not
the Nondescripts we l o s e . Some of the best a l l -
round College men haven't quite the b r i l l i a n c e
r e q u i r e d at I.C., and they have to leave, to e n r i c h
u s u a l l y a p o l y t e c h n i c , or Her Majesty's Forces,
with t h e i r sparkle.
For some reason, nobody ever says muoh about
the "ohuoked out bods". F e l i x has never mentioned
them, save i n a passing referenee i n the f i r s t
F e l i x of the session. But i t i s a most important
problem when a College l o s e s some of the most
promising people i t ever gets. I f e a r i t emphasises
the faot that I.C. i s f a r more of a t e c h n o l o g i e s !
school than a U n i v e r s i t y College, and has no time
f o r those who don't show promise of being top grade
t e c h n o l o g i s t s . The s t a f f are only too glad to
l o s e , and r a p i d l y f o r g e t , the s o i e n t i f i e a l l y seoond
r a t e . A r e a l U n i v e r s i t y i s a place where one's
primary objeot i s to develop one's p e r s o n a l i t y and
i n t e l l e c t to the f u l l , i n a background which may
be s c i e n t i f i c or a r t i s t i c according to one's
temperament. Oxford and Cambridge are l i k e t h a t ,
but London never has been.
A l l t h i s r a i s e s a l o t of red h e r r i n g s . We
a l l know that London can't be a U n i v e r s i t y , and
that I.C. can't be a U n i v e r s i t y C o l l e g e ; they both
have too important U t i l i t a r i a n funotlons i n sooiety.
We a l s o know that I.C. has to chuck out men to
leave room f o r t,he cream to work p r o p e r l y , but
none of t h i s a l t e r s the f a o t that the College i s
a e s t h e t i c a l l y and humanly the poorer f o r t h e i r
departure, which i s a very sad t h i n g .
It i s however one ox ouose sad things that
can't be helped. Without being i r r e v e r e n t , i t i s
l i k e someone dying - i t can't be helped, but i t i s
a l o s s to Sooiety, with the exception that i n that
case Sooiety recognises i t s l o s s , and attaches due
seriousness to i t . I.C. never appears to regret
i t s losses due to chucking-out, which apathy I've
spent a column deploring. I've nothing to
suggest that should be done about them, but any-
t h i n g would be better than pretending that these
people have never been. Well, I've done my b i t ;
the only consolation I oan see i s that the poor
b l i g h t e r s are probably happier outside t h i s
i n s t i t u t i o n . EDDIE
