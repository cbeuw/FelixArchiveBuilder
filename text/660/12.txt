meeting in the Lounge above Harry's Bar this

now Rag Week is over, do you?
Not a chance: we still have the Rag Mag
selling trip to Bristol and Bath Universities

down there this is an extremely cheap way of
going to see them as well as to sell Rag Mags.
See me or Sean Davis, James Benbow or
the other VPs if you want to go.
The following Sunday we have the last Rag
stunt of this year, the annual West End carol
singing, with punch in the office to follow to
warm up your frost bitten tootsies. (More

to attend the RCSU General Committee on

IC Bookshop
I know I say this every year. But in answer to
the letter in FELIX two weeks ago, the
Bookshop is here to make a profit, albeit a
small one. However, prices of books are set
by the publisher which by law we have to sell
at. Stationery items in most cases we sell at
less than Recommended Selling Price, ie 200
sheets Refill Pads RSP £2.10, our price £1.25.
I must admit if we didn't have to make a
profit, life would be slightly easier.
We have a large selection of general books
either paperback or cloth that will make ideal
Christmas presents, plus many stationery
items. If an item is in the window, don't
hesitate to ask any member of the staff to get
it out for you to look at.
A large selection of Christmas cards, both
general and College are available.
This year for the first time, we have a
College Calendar with twelve views of the
College £2.95.
The Sportshop has a wide selection of
sportswear, rackets, trainers, tracksuits, etc.
Wine goblets, half pint and pint mugs with
the College crest. Also, there're items such as
cuff links, tie clips, ties, scarves and lest we
forget the Carl Burgess Powder Compact.
ICSO
Tonight (Friday 2 December) sees the termly
concert given by Imperial College Symphony
Orchestra. In yet another ambitious pro-
gramme, they will tackle 'Espafia' by
Chabrier, 'Four Last Songs' by Richard
Strauss, and Shostakovich's Fifth
Symphony.
