Keys
I have now had lists of users from
most of the clubs who presently
sign out keys from Beit Security.
All those listed should go over to
the Chief Security Officer (near
Messengers Desk. Sherfield) to
collect a card between 12:30 and
1:00pm on Wednesdays. If you
cannot make this time you will
need to provide a photograph of
yourself when collecting a card.
The card system will be
introduced alter Christmas and
those without cards will not have
access next term.
Telephones
I am writing to the College Safety
Officer about problems with out
of hours emergency telephone
facilities. II you have been
involved in an incident where you
were unable to get assistance from
the College emergency service
please let me know with details of
date, time and incident.
Day Bookings
I have had several complaints
from students about bookings
problems in the C o l l e g e
Conference Office. If you feel that
vou have been misinformed and
denied access to facilities please let
me know again with details.
Equally I have had complaints
from the Conference Office about
students with late bookings.
Please ensure that bookings are
made two weeks in advance with
Day Bookings as bookings after
that date involve are more likely
to be overlooked.
Union Building
The state of the Union Building
has deteriorated rapidly this term,
greatly contributed to by clubs
not bothering to replace furniture
or clean up. In future clubs will be
lined heavilv.
