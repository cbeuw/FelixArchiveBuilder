W O M E N ' S
This year WIST will be running a campaign
on women's health issues, one of our major
areas of concern being the recent reports
published in the 'Lancet' on some aspects of
the risks involved in taking the contraceptive
pill.
Two reports were published, one found
that women who had taken high proges-
terone pills for at least six years before age 25
were more likely to develop breast cancers
by the age of 37, and the other found that
women who had taken pills for more than
four years had a relatively high risk of
developing cervical cancer.
While both studies have flaws and are not
H E A L T H
conclusive they have provoked a renewed
national public interest and concern, espe-
cially amongst women. WIST has therefore
arranged two meetings during Human Rights
Week, one with a speaker from the Family
Planning Authority and one with a speaker
who is doing research on medical statistics.
There may be further speaker meetings and
discussions on this subject later this term or
next term, to help the needs of women
in College. Our stall in the JCR at lunch time
on Thursday 8 December will have leaflets
and family planning authority notices on the
pill and other subjects.
