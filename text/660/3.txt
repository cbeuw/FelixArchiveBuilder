evidently decided that Mr Walker
should stay on and persuaded Mr
Turner to take the appointment
as Manager of the head tenancies
at 6 and 8 Earl's Court Square.
(The problems being encoun-
tered at this head tenancy were
highlighted in FELIX three
weeks ago.)
During the long vacation the
Summer Letting Scheme at the
Fremantle was run by Andrew
Barron along with some
assistants. He and Mr Walker
were both concerned with the
condition of the Fremantle,
particularly the leaking roof. The
fire precautions were also of
concern and Mr Barron called in
the Fire Inspectors who criticised
the condition of many fire
extinguishers and other
equipment. Mr Barron was given
a stern dressing down by Michael
Arthur for going behind his back
in this way. Apparently no
improvements have been made in
fire equipment and several light
fittings on the corridor on the top
floor have had water leaking into
them and have shorted causing
smoke and scorch marks on the
ceiling.
The body in College
responsible for assessing the state
of buildings, including head
tenancies, is the Estates
department. They surveyed the
building before it was taken on
initially and failed to discover
any serious problems despite the
fact that the roof was clearly
faulty at the time.
It seems that Mr Walker is not
justified in blaming Michael
Arthur for the lack of progress in
the repairs since this is Estates'
responsiblity. It appears that Mr
Walker has developed a strong
dislike of Michael Arthur and
this may be colouring his
judgement on the issue.
Mr Walker antagonised Mr
Arthur earlier this term when he
gave FELIX details of the
structural problems at the
Fremantle and blamed Mr
Arthur, rather than Estates, for
the situation. Mr Walker's
allegations of an unjustifiably
high rent increase have more
foundation. Fremantle rents
went up nearly 10% this year
compared to only 4% in halls of
residences. It seems that this is
only partly due to the increase
paid to the landlords, the rest
being due to revised estimates of
summer lettings income and the
increased number of rooms being
used by the Warden and
Subwardens. Rents in the
Fremantle are now quite high
compared with other head
tenancies.
It appears whilst Mr Walker
has been concerned with the lack
of progress in repairs to the
Fremantle he has not been very
successful as a Warden. He is not
popular amongst this year's new
residents (who know nothing
about last year's animosity),
most of whom have hardly met
him and were apathetic towards
his performance when inter-
viewed by FELIX. It seems he
has few supporters either
amongst the residents or the
subwardens at the Fremantle and
plays little part in the Hotel's
social life. His attempts to whip
up support for him to stay on as
Warden have met with little
Absolute Power
Teller Told Off
Christine Teller, Union Deputy
President, criticised Union
Disciplinary procedure last night
for not allowing her sufficient
power to discipline students as-
she feels fit.
When a meeting of the appeals
committee yesterday unanimous-
ly overturned her ruling against
the Latin-American Society
earlier this term Miss Teller
remained adamant that she had
done the right thing. Both in
fining the society £50 and later
banning them from the use of the
Union rooms it was ruled that
Miss Teller had exceeded her
brief as Deputy President.
Readers of FELIX will know
about the incident resulting in the
appeal, and how a student
uninvolved in the LAS disrupted
a party earlier this term.
Responsibility for disciplining
this student has now been passed
to the Exec. Christine Teller took
the decision of the appeals
committee very badly and
refused to deal with LAS
incidents alone in the future.
Exec Split!
IC Union Hon Sec Sean Davis is
absolutely fed up with the large
number of conferences, parties
and boose-ups enjoyed by the
sabbaticals and their friends at
the Union's expense.
A motion at next week's U G M
is aimed at stopping the latest
freebie organised by Council. As
three representatives prepare to
go to Blackpool for a free
weekend at the NUS Conference,
one of them, RCS President Eric
Darbyshire will be joining Sean
Davis in his opposition to the
trip. While addressing itself to the
NUS conference in particular, the
motion is concerned with a much
wider issue asking for the whole
process of sending people to and
spending money on these
conferences to be reviewed.
The Union spends in total
about £2,000 each year on
sending people on conferences.
The Union representatives are
normally sabbaticals and their
value to the U n i o n is
questionable. The prime example
of this is the INCOST Conference
in Finland planned for next year.
INCOST is an International
Conference of Students of
Technology, inviting repre-
sentatives from student unions all
over the world to a week of
parties and tourist visits in a
foreign country. Last year's
conference in Delft had only ten
delegates in total, two of them
being from IC, the only British
college prepared to spend £800
on such an event. As expected
Stephen Goulder had a
thoroughly good time but the
only reply from Jim Boucher (the
other IC delegate) when asked
what benefit the Union got from
the conference was a laconic
'none'.
Bare Faced Cheek
Balloon Dancers at the RCS Smoking Concert
The RCS Smoking Concert
turned out to be an extraordinary
assembly of impressarios and
raving lunatics.
The winners of the much
coveted Smoking Concert Oscar,
designed in the shape of a full
whisky bottle, were the newly
formed rock group the LTmp
Members, who in their debut
concert performed a number of
classic songs with revised lyrics.
The numbers including 'Take a
Walk around Southside',
'Leprosy Blues' and 'Bald Thing'
(previously recorded under the
title 'Wild Thing') in which Mike
Stuart, Guilds President,
appeared in his blue dress.
Guilds Carnival last Friday
turned out to be a lively finale to
Rag Week, as expected. The
popular combination of bands,
discos and films was a great
crowd-puller and the event was
easily the best attended of the
week.
Carnival looks like making a
profit this year; it was estimated
that the event had paid for itself
by two o'clock Saturday
morning.
The One Million andOne Down
Darts competition in Southside
Bar between two teams from
RCS departments ended just in
time for first lecture on Monday
morning after 63 hours. The
winning team was from Maths
and Physics, with their
opponents from Chemistry and
Life Sciences giving up an hour
earlier after realising they were
too far behind to win.
