Andrew Walker, Warden of the Fremantle Hotel head tenancy,
has resigned in mysterious circumstances. It seems that he was
asked to resign by Union President Gaynor Lewis after she had
received complaints involving M r Walker. However Miss Lewis
claims that no pressure was brought on M r Walker to resign.
Michael Arthur
Details of the incidents have
not been released, however
sources close to Mr Walker claim
he has been forced out because of
his criticism of the failure of
Student Services Officer Mr
Michael Arthur to ensure that
major repairs were carried out on
the Hotel. It is also claimed that
Michael Arthur had adopted a
blase attitude to the problems at
the Fremantle and has been
prepared to let unfit rooms at an
exorbitant rent.
However, Mr Arthur denies
that he has been instrumental in
forcing Mr Walker's resignation,
or that Mr Walker has been
sacked for his performance as a
Warden.
The Fremantle Hotel was
acquired shortly before the start
of the 1982/3 session. Mr WaUcer
was invited to take on the
Wardenship at very short notice
by Michael Arthur since there
was no time to use the normal
procedure for appointments.
Right from the start there were
problems with water leaking into
many rooms through the roof.
Some repairs were carried out,
but these proved to be
inadequate. In addition there
were problems in running the
Andrew Walker
hotel caused by personal friction
between Mr Walker and the then
subwarden Gary Turner. Mr
Turner, an employee of the
Student Services Office, was also
appointed by Michael Arthur at
very short notice, despite not
being a student. Mr Turner
quickly developed a strong
dislike for Mr Walker and was
frequently to be found in the
Fremantle Bar boasting to
Fremantle residents that he was
in charge and that he did not take
any notice of Mr Walker. This
contributed to the situation
where Mr Walker commanded
little respect amongst the
residents and had trouble
maintaining discipline, par-
ticularly in the bar which was
frequently kept open by Mr
Turner until the small hours of
the morning. Mr Walker's
position was further undermined
by the fact that a frequent
participant in these late night
drinking sessions was Michael
Arthur himself.
At the end of the spring term
last session it became apparent
that either Mr Walker or Mr
Turner would have to leave the
Fremantle. Michael Arthur

Bomb Scare!
Reeves Saves The Day
In an incredible attempt to stop
complaints from Mews residents,
Geoffrey Reeves, College Security
Officer, placed a bomb in Princes
Gate Mews on Monday morning.
Suspicion was first aroused
when a parcel arrived at the
Southside messengers' desk
addressed to Tizard Hallâ€”and
the parcel had no name on it! The
stunned messenger, Patrick Ng,
was the first to see the parcel. He
called in housekeeper Kate
McPherson who started to open
the box. And thefirst thing she saw
inside was electrical wiring!
The horrified housekeeper
called in Chief Security Officer
Reeves who rushed to the scene
with a long stick and his favourite
walkie-talkie. Patrick Ng ran
through the bar shouting 'It's a
bomb, it's a bomb,' but no one
believed him! Eventually the
whole of Southside was.
evacuated and the Bomb Squad
summoned as Mr Reeves
prodded the bomb with his stick.
His suspicions were aroused
when he peered into the box
inside the parcel. He decided it
must be removed from College
premises and so, showing great
courage and disregard for
personal safety, he carried it
down the steps into the Mews.
When it was suggested that he
had acted very bravely, he smiled
modestly and said it was only
part of his job.
The Mews residents were not
evacuated. Mr Reeves said that
the walls of Mews buildings
would contain the blast.
The Bomb Squad arrived and
approached the bomb in the
sealed off area. They were about
to make it safe when a Tizard
Hall resident returning for lunch
enquired about the guitar echo
unit kit which he was expecting
by mail order. He was shocked to
discover the Bomb Squad
investigating his mail. One quick
explanation later the kit was
delivered to its rightful owner.
Students returned to their
lukewarm lunches, the Bomb
Squad were sent home and
Geoffrey Reeves rode off into the
sunset.
