SPRINGBOARD
THE POSTGRADUATE CHOICE IS YOURS
World-weary graduates are too many yawns awav from the realities
of our changing world; reclining attitudes are definitely not for us.
We need the energetic, ambitious kind.
Those who will share our determination to continue leading the world
of telecommunications - in sheer technological expertise, innovative-
ness, and sound commercial flair.
Those who will welcome the variety and scope of work available in
our large multi-faceted organisation. Those who will be eager to work
at the forefront of the seemingly limitless growth area of infor-
mation technology.
That's why we seek top graduate talent - especially graduates with
good honours degrees in electronics, computing or finance and the
drive to succeed in a highly competitive environment.
Ask at your Careers Office for our brochures Graduate B i o -
graphies and Graduate Opportunities (which has an application
form in the back). A viewing of our videocassette could also help you
decide to spring our way.
