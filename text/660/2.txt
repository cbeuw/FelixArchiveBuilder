Continuing
Injustices
Dear Pallab
I would like to draw people's
attention to the continuing
injustices, first exposed by
FELIX on 4 November.
If people read further than
the sensational headline
'Violence at Union Party', they
will know I refer to the ban
imposed on the Latin American
Society (LAS) from the holding
of events on Union premises.
In informing LAS of the ban,
ICU Deputy President Miss
Christine Teller attempts to
justify her immediate action to
the incident: T can only assume
that nobody from the society
stepped in to try to prevent or
stop it.'
She is correct only in her
choice of words, in that
anybody not preserit at the time
'can only assume'.
As FELIX made clear, LAS
members did restrain the
person concerned (with little
help frm the security guards)
and in fact did call the police.
Even though LAS have been
told it is 'responsible for the
conduct of people at the event',
the person concerned had
already left the party. It is
highly unreasonable if not
ridiculous to hold L A S
responsible for any activities in
the ladies toilets!
Despite the publicity
afforded in FELIX, as far as I
know, little has changed. That
is except the justification of the
ban. Now Miss Teller 'can only
assume' that the atmosphere at
the party must have been
conducive to violent behaviour.
I have no need to resort to
assumptions. I can state as fact
that the party atmosphere was
one of the friendliest I have
experienced.
The unfairness of the ban is
plain to see, crippling a society
of which the culprit is not even a
member. He is an IC student so
the ban is wholly ineffective in
that it does nothing to stop the
recurrence of such incidents by
individuals.
It is about time Miss Teller
displayed some integrity in
dealing with such problems.
Surely there is a fairer, more
effective action than the finding
of a scapegoat.
Yours, in solidarity with the
Latin American Society,
John Sattaur

Ranting
On
Dear Pallab
This year FELIX is playing a
large part in the publicising of
Human Rights Week. I hope that
you will acknowledge your
responsibility to help prevent this
occasion being hijacked for
political purposes. There always
plenty of left-wing societies
prepared to rant on about South
Africa, Chile, South Africa
It is unfortunate that an ugly,
anti-American feeling currently
prevalent amongst extreme left
activists, is becoming more and
more trendy and acceptable.
These people carefully overlook
the fact that by far the worst
violations of human rights occur
behind the iron curtain. It is
particularly notable that C N D
have staked their dubious claim
to represent Human Rights
causes. If this type of thing is
allowed to go on, perhaps Sci Fi
Soc will have a campaign. Will
they betray their home planet in
the same way as CND betray the
free world? Finally, I must warn
you to beware of seemingly
innocuous societies such as Veg
Soc, which are actually fronts for
Communists, animal lovers,
corrupt Union officials, etc, none
of whom care about human
rights at all.
Yours sincerely

Rag Week
Blues
Dear FELIX
Would someone please tell
me when Rag Week starts? I
know it's on as I've seen posters
saying which day but very few
saying where or when.
Also, whilst on the subject of
the lack of communication, I
have only seen one person
advertising any event, the RCS
Smoking Concert ticket seller,
but up until then I thought that
a Smoking Concert was where
people played tunes like the
Stuyvesant Blues.
Surely it wouldn't take much
effort to organise groups of
people within each C C U to
advertise and whip up support
for the Rag Week events. You
could use the existing structure
of year reps, print accurate
details in FELIX, etc.
C'mon, this College has great
potential, harness it.
Yours disgruntedly

Blatantly
Stilted
Dear Pallab
I notice that the pornography
issue is a regular theme on your
letters page. Each time I read a
letter I get more and more
angry. 'Whilst not being the
most precise user of the English
language myself, even I can spot
the blatant abuse of it when
used in letters concerning
pornography; and even in
FELIX's reporting of it.
I refer of course to the phrase
'Mines Block Vote'. The term
'block vote' refers to the voting
power of a number of
individuals as used by a single
representative on their behalf.
If the voting at a U G M was
done only by the CCUs on
behalf of their members, then
Mr Crownshaw's vote would be
a 'block vote'; it is not and the
votes of RSMU individuals seen
at U G M is not either. It has
been the case that individuals of
the RSMU have been willing to
turn up to cast their individual
vote at UGMs. It has been the
effect of defeating the anti-
p o r n o g r a p h y m o t i o n s ,
countless times, which has led
supporters of these motions to
seek a derogatory term of
reference to account for these
previous defeats. The use of the
term has been in an effort to
diminish the validity of the
opinions of those who oppose
anti-pornographers. Where will
these stop in their blatantly
stilted propaganda and
opinions.
For the sake of brevity I will
avoid discussing at length the
sudden change in attitudes that
has occured: previous U G M
votes did not represent the view
of the majority (on at least 5
times): the last U G M vote was
representative?

Moscow
Mouthpiece
Dear Sir
I wish to draw your attention
to the fact that certain teachers
may be allowing their political
persuasions to interfere with the
marks they give to students.
I am currently seconded from
the RAF to do a computing
course at this College. In the
short time since the course
began, I have been the butt of
several politically-slanted
asides from one of my lecturers.
I recognise it is the right of
every individual to make up
their own mind about the
nuclear debate, however naive
their conclusions and however
silly the badge they wear as a
result. But these mouthpieces of
Moscow are particularly
distressing, given the deaths of,
so many people in the last war
defending freedom of speech.
Through my time in the
RAF, I met and got on with
people of all shades of the
political spectrum. Isn't it
ironic that, at Imperial Colelge,
a college known for its
computers and technological
progress, one should encounter
the first vestiges of ideological
persecution?

will appreciate, I would rather
