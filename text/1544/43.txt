Suguru
This is the last time, I swear (for this term, at least): draw a single closed loop by
vertically and horizontally joining the dots so that the numbered squares are sur-
rounded by the corresponding number of lines.
Hashi
Connect all the is-
lands with bridges
so that you can get
from any island to any
other one. There are
restrictions, though:
the bridges have to be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must
not intersect. You can
have up to two bridg-
es between any two
islands and, last but
not least, each island
must have exactly as
many bridges stem-
ming from it as the
number on it.
The time has come again when
I take out your favourite puz-
zles and replace them with
new, “experimental” ones.
Hopefully Ophis was one of
your favourites (that’s what I
tell myself at night), but, as a
test run, try your hand at the
Suguru.
The object is to fill these jum-
bled outlined blocks with
numbers. 2-cell blocks must
contain the numbers 1 and 2,
3-cell blocks the number 1, 2,
and 3, and so forth. The catch
is that no two same digits must
appear in bordering cells (not
even diagonal ones).
