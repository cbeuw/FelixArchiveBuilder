Dolce and
Gabbana Fragile delicacy was the theme at Val-
entino this season, as Chiuri and Pic-
cioli showcased a stunning assortment
of high collared, loosely tailored dresses.
The subtle strictness behind every piece
set a sense of Brontë-like restraint; as if
each decoration of crisp white embroi-
dered lace had been designed for the
characters in The Professor itself. Come
next winter for the dedicated Valentino
girl, although legs will be bared aplenty,
shoulders will almost be as sacredly cov-
ered as the décolletage.

Oscar de la
Renta
The most anticipated show this season
was that of Oscar de la Renta as the world
of fashion anxiously awaited results of
his collaboration with the infamous John
Galliano. Having taken him on as an ac-
commodating step towards recovery just
a couple of months back, de la Renta most
This season’s golden collection goes to
Milan Fashion Week’s Dolce and Gab-
bana as the pair turned to the traditional
treasures of Italy for inspiration, con-
cocting glittering mosaics and jewelled
montages. Relaxed womanly shapes and
dangling golden crosses, each saintly
piece was as much a work of art as a
wearable garment, perhaps a timely
ploy showcasing the irony in the riches
of faith. Immaculate attention as al-
ways had been crafted into every detail
as miniature bags came encrusted with
jewels, and roses delicately entwined
themselves around heels and toes. The
Dolce and Gabbana girls this season
were the definition of feminine power
and true nobility, and never has a set of
crowns looked so felicitous.
definitely bequeathed more of his col-
lection to Galliano than to the standard
apprentice. The collection, although still
true to the house in its classic styles, was
edgier than the label is used to seeing.
Harshly knotted belts forced clinched
pleats to shape the otherwise cocoon-
like pieces, as shoulders came as outsized
as the erect hats propped over the heads
of models; as if the girls themselves were
beautiful moths trying to escape from the
sharp grasps of nature. Perhaps a delicate
reflection of the difficulties Galliano had
faced in order to finally re-emerge from
the dark. The real moment of metamor-
phosis, however, came in the form of
mysteriously dark hooded capes, which
effortlessly infused the gothic drama of
Galliano with the simple nostalgia de la
Renta always captures so perfectly. If the
speculations of this comradeship carving
out a future for both parties prove true,
then to join and conquer may well turn
into fashion’s new rule.
