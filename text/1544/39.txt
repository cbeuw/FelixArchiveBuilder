Smartphones aﬀect almost every aspect
of the average student’s life. Marvels of
modern technology, something under-
lined by the much quoted: “your smart-
phone has the equivalent
processing power of the
computers used for the
Apollo space missions”,
they have revolutionised
the way we interact with
other human beings as
well as giving us tools to
accomplish a multitude of
tasks. In a sense these increas-
ingly powerful devices have
freed us from a desk-bound
environment, as they can ful-
ﬁl many tasks that your aver-
age desktop would do. All in all
it seems smartphones enrich our
daily lives.
Now to the absolutely
cliché question: or have
they? Recent data sug-
gests that smart-
phones may not
really be the boon so-
ciety has hoped for.
A rising trend of
smartphone ad-
diction in teens
in various ﬁrst-
world countries
has led some experts
to worry. More than
60 per cent of teens in the
UK say they are addicted to
their smartphone, and those are
just the ones willing to admit to it.
You might argue that smartphones in-
crease eﬃciency, and I couldn’t argue
against this, as they allow us to utilise
the time where we are away from the
desktop/laptop. Although they can also
help us have fun while at our desks, if
instead of studying for your exams, you
play with constant vibration apps.
I myself have experienced a somewhat
strange consequence of this addiction
in Imperial. While sitting in my lecture,
FRIDAY 15 MARCH

somewhat disillusioned by the dry
lecture topic, I decided to take a look
around at my fellow students to en-
tertain myself. What I discovered sur-
prised me somewhat. Of the 20 people
in my immediate vicinity, about 16 of
them had their smartphones either on
their desks, laps or in their hands.
Seriously people, what is the
point of going to your lecture
if all you
are
going to do is stare at your smart-
phone 90 per cent of the time? Are
you really paying Imperial’s fees to sit
in a lecture theatre and answer Face-
book messages?
Using your smartphone on the toi-
let, sleeping with your smartphone,
checking your smartphone on more
than an hourly basis and getting a
panic attack (also known as nomo-
phobia: no mobile phobia) if you are
without your smartphone could all be
symptoms of smartphone addiction. If
you exhibit all of these symptoms, but
remain unsure if you are addicted, try
this little thought experiment: imag-
ine a whole day where instead of your
smartphone you have a feature phone
(i.e. you can text and call, what phones

General news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date with the
newest, weirdest and most futuristic things around.
Liking Facebook likes
Scientists have recently developed an algorithm that uses Facebook likes to ac-
curately predict different personality traits. The algorithm can predict ethnic-
ity, sexual orientation, political preference and religion with a success rate of
at least 80%. That however is not the least of it, as using the data that your Fa-
cebook likes provide this algorithm can make strange connections that would
normally seem totally unrelated. For examples, if you like curly fries you are
more likely to be highly intelligent, while a Harley Davidson fetish implies a
lower IQ. Also, if you are a girl and liked Hello Kitty, this, strangely enough,
suggests that you are emotionally unstable. Thinking about it though, this may
not actually be that strange.
Chromebook Immune
At Google’s Pwnium, hackers fail to crack Google’s Chrome OS, leaving a
£2.1 million prize unclaimed. While the OS has little to really offer, as it is a
web-based operating system, this added security (which was not achieved by
anyone else) might appeal to businesses or government agencies that rely on
keeping secrets.
Microsoft Kinect now open
The main code behind the Kinect, which allows it to recognize faces, move-
ments and colours has finally been revealed to the general public. Previously
Microsoft released a software package, which allowed for some limited
customisation of the Kinect for coders. However, this did not really allow for
the true potential of the Kinect to be realised. Now with the code behind it
to be utilised, we may see some pretty awesome things.
And now here something random for you to see:

If these thoughts alone make you
start shivering and breaking out
in sweat, don’t fret dear reader,
for this esteemed writer him-
self suﬀers from the same
condition. So what to do now?
Well, as with any addiction,
the key is to admit to yourself
that you have it. Only
then can you actu-
ally commence
along the path
to recovery.
Start wean-
ing yourself
oﬀ your
phone; do
not look
at it every

hour, and
set your-
self a time
limit for
not using
it. In fact
I ﬁnd lec-
tures to be
the perfect time interval for this, and
it adds the beneﬁt of enhancing my
productivity.
Now I am not saying that smart-
phone addition is a serious problem,
but when people have to introduce
rules to ban smartphones from din-
ner dates, then something really has
to be done, before all social interac-
tion is replaced by a 4’’ to 5’’ screen.
In fact the quote: “Life is what hap-
pens around you, while you are
starting at your smartphone screen”
perfectly describes what’s going on.
People are so scared that they are
going to miss out on Facebook no-
tiﬁcations, emails and texts, that in
fact they miss out on what is hap-
pening in the real world.
