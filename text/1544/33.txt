Oz the Great and
Powerful
Director: Sam Raimi
Screenwriters: Mitchell Kapner,
David Lindsay-Abaire
Starring: James Franco, Mila Kunis,
Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams
he Wizard of Oz may be a great and
powerful man but Sam Raimi’s mod-
ern origins story possesses neither of
those two qualities. Instead of going
for something grand and epic, Raimi
opts for the easy way out, pouring all
of his expensive budget into the sce-
nic visual treat. here is very little
focus on building any kind of coher-
ent story, and much like Tim Burton’s
highly disappointing Alice in Won-
derland back in 2010, the ﬁlm’s heart
is in all the wrong places – which
comes as yet another letdown.
In the traditional Wizard of Oz
style, the ﬁlm starts oﬀ in black-and-
white mode, as we are introduced to
Oscar/Oz (Franco), a womanising,
self-centred circus magician/con-
artist who dreams of not just good-
ness, but greatness. After a string of
events that land him in a hot air bal-
loon in the midst of a terrifying tor-
nado, Oscar narrowly escapes death
and ends up in the colourful land of
Oz.
Here is where the ﬁlm churns out
an endless stream of magniﬁcent
looking unique features of Oz’s na-
ture – the trees, the ﬂowers, the
leaves, all the bright, vibrant colours
come to life more so with the extra
dimension, and this head-spinning
sequence goes on for far too long in
fact, completely going over the top,
spending more than the necessary
amount of time concentrating on its
pretty visuals rather than pushing on
with the story.
Meeting him ﬁrst is heodora (Ku-
nis) the good witch, who then in-
troduces him to her sister Evanora
(Weisz), who clearly isn’t a very good
witch. here is a prophecy in Oz
that a great wizard bearing the same
name as their world will descend
from the skies, will defeat the Wick-
ed Witch and will restore peace. hat
man appears to be Oscar himself,
who instantly grabs the opportunity
to become rich and powerful.
heodora truly falls for him, even
delving into a fantasy world of her
own where she will become Oscar’s
wife and the two of them will rule
over Oz as a happy couple. he sin-
ister Evanora isn’t convinced, and
the political power struggle between
the witches is further complicated by
Glinda (Williams) who is so clearly
the purest one of them all, what with
her white dress and blonde hair. Lies
and deceit tear these individuals
apart, and eventually there comes a
time where Oscar needs to step up,
and lead an army to overthrow the
dark powers that control Oz.
Only that it takes absolutely ages
for Oscar to come to his senses.
here is a lot of repetition when it
comes to portraying him as a money/
power/woman-hungry human who
only cares about the royal treasures
of Oz. Okay we get that he needs to
change and as this is a Disney ﬁlm we
also know that he will play the hero
in the end but the ﬁlm’s narrative is
bogged down by one too many refer-
ences to the fact that he’s capable of
more than he knows.
But when it comes to the ﬁnale
and linking everything together with
what we’ve seen in he Wizard of Oz,
the ﬁlm does manage to establish
some clever links and use Oscar’s
baseline skills to its advantage in cre-
ating a big showdown. His skills as a
con-artist he used so well on Earth
are put to good use here, as are his
sneaky wits. Franco does his best
with the very limited sides to his lead
character, one shallow, the other re-
formed and committed, but he brings
enough cheeky humour into the role
to provide some intermittent laughs.
As his sidekicks, the two computer
animated characters are absolutely
spot-on in design. he China Girl
(Joey King) and Finley (Zach Braﬀ)
the ﬂying monkey, though they don’t
exactly do much to contribute for
most of the ﬁlm’s plot, show what
amazing things tons of money and
special eﬀects can do.
Infuriatingly side-lined however,
are the three witches. heir rela-
tionships are barely explored, and
the dubious intentions that often
don’t make a lot of sense are forced
in to spice up the dynamic between
the three of them. Weisz, the obvi-
ous villain here, is disappointingly
given a character too similar to that
of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
in that she’s obsessed with looks, and
she cunningly uses a poisoned apple
to get her way. Weisz has a lot of fun
with her duplicitous trouble-making
witch, although she doesn’t get nearly
enough screen time to shine. Kunis
gets the juiciest part here as the ﬁlm’s
worst kept secret, and most obvious
twist turn out to be true, hint hint.
Williams is as lovely as ever but a
touch bland, and frustratingly with-
out much power. here is a witch duel
between Glinda and Evanora, one
that ends far too quickly without ever
feeling as epic as the trailers make it
out to be.
All in all it’s a hugely missed oppor-
tunity, that cannot even make up for
its thin plot with all the love for its
visual department. he heart simply
is not there, and neither is the excite-
ment. Everything may look amazing,
(the big, grand palaces, the costumes
etc) but what’s behind them is sur-
prisingly empty and hollow.
