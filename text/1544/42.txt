This week you are so tired of
life that you fall into a three
year sleep. When you wake
up, the 70% of your body
constituted by water has
evaporated and you are just
a wrinkled bag of bones.
Even your poo has ossified
and it takes 8 packets of
laxatives to shift it from your
dehydrated anus.
ThisweekyouaretheBigElec-
tions. You think you’re a big
deal, all these people sharing
your voting page and the like.
Then BOOM! A group of idi-
ots saying “stop emailing me”
overshadows you and noone
cares about you anymore. You
feel bad and decide to up your
game... By emailing everyone
that hasn’t voted.
This week you are a troll. A real
troll that goes stone in sun-
light and smells of feet. You
hate that people are misusing
your name as a way of repre-
senting people acting like bel-
lends. You’re a lovely person
despite the smell and feel sad
and want to find the person re-
sponsible for this and clobber
them with a club or something.
‘Thisweekyoureceivearemind-
er email about your coursework
deadline you forgot about at
13.30 on Monday. You miss it
and have an awkward explana-
tion to make to your department
about how you were at centre
of a 3.5 million message email
storm. They don’t believe you
as staff didn’t receive any of the
emails. Capped at 40%. Pint?’
This week you are a PhD stu-
dent. You look at Facebook
and have no clue what’s go-
ing on with all these emails,
and only hear stories of it like
someone watching the news
after a disaster. You feel bad
and want to help but... meh.
You walk back into your lab
and stare at some samples
for five hours. Bliss.
This week you wake up to
find the Easter Bunny fucking
you in the butt. You thought
he was a myth. A legend. A
lie. But it turns out he’s a 6
ft mutant rabbit, who is just
as horny as the normal bug-
gers. He ejaculates in your
eye, and eats all of your car-
rots. Wow. He doesn’t even
leave any chocolate. Rude.
This week you are drowning in
broccoli and stilton soup. As
the viscous liquid envelopes
you, you try to sustain buoy-
ancy with a floating broccoli
floret, but it only weighs you
down. The last thing that per-
meates your consciousness is
the pungent, nauseous aroma
of blue cheese clawing at the
back of your nostrils.
This week you save some-
one’s life and enjoy the warm,
noble feeling it gives you so
much that you create scenari-
os where people are about to
die just so you can save them.
But one case goes horribly
wrong: the victim is decapi-
tated, and you lose an arm
and are ironically arrested for
murder. Fuck altruism…
This week you wake up feel-
ing dirty and bored of your
skin so have it surgically re-
moved. While you’re waiting
for new skin to grow however,
everyone laughs at your raw
appearance. The bullying
gets so bad that you skin one
of your tormentors in retalia-
tion and wear his flayed exte-
rior as your own new coat.
‘This week you receive a re-
minder email about your
coursework deadline you for-
got about at 13.30 on Monday.
You miss it and have an awk-
ward explanation to make to
your department about how
you were at centre of a 3.5
million message storm. They
don’t believe you as staff didn’t
receive any emails. Capped at
40%. Pint?’
This week you start lactating
orange juice from your left nip-
ple. At first it’s great – Tropicana
quality on tap without the cost!
But after a week your nipple be-
comes sore with the repeated
squeezing and the citrus acid
inflames your new outlet of
breakfastjuice.Eventually,pres-
sure builds up and your breast
explodes in your lecturer’s face.
This week you must choose
between sucking the toe of a
diabetic with chronic foot ulcers
and sucking off a donkey. While
the toe sucking would at least
involve human contact, the
smell of rotting flesh might over-
whelm. Alternatively, the donkey
blow-job would be illegal but at
least one of the parties would
enjoy it. What’s it going to be?
