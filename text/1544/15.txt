FRIDAY 15 MARCH
Facebook celebrity? Looking for a job?
Pedro Pereira interviews Adzuna co-founder Andrew Hunter
he eternal procrastinat-
ing tool… Facebook. Or
is it? Adzuna, a social
job search engine, has
developed a way to help
you get hired with a little help from
your friends. Launched out of a cen-
tral London pub in July 2011, this
small London startup, with over 1.5
million monthly visitors, classiﬁes it-
self as the future Google for jobs with
a social network side. Not only that,
they search thousands of job websites
so you don’t have to, and even give
job seekers access to a wide range of
job statistics and data to make their
search even more eﬃcient.
PP: So ﬁrst of all the important
stuﬀ... what kind of name is Ad-
zuna?
AH: “Zuna” means “abundance” in a
number of African languages. We aim
to be the most abundant classiﬁed ads
site on the web, and to bring the best
ads sooner than anyone else. Hence
the name Ad-zuna!
PP: How are you diﬀerent from oth-
er job search sites? Can you explain
how the social networking feature
in more detail?
AH: Job ads are fragmented and too
complicated to navigate. Users want
to search all the ads in one place,
which is what we provide at Adzuna:
a one-stop shop. We then make the
search experience better and empow-
er our users to ﬁnd the right ads for
them, by layering on innovations in
social and big data. he biggest mis-
conception about our business is that
we’re a portal where you can post ads
(like Monster or Gumtree). Adzuna is
a search engine (like Google).

mother proud.

ployees must

ature is above

Adzuna Connect is a social tool that
allows jobseekers to see hundreds
of job vacancies they are connected
to via their ﬁrst and second degree
social connections in LinkedIn and
Facebook. he average jobseeker has
no idea they’re connected to over 300
relevant, open job vacancies through
their social networks. Also, over 90%
of companies, large and small, are
now using social media to ﬁnd staff.
We also provide users with rich, in-
sightful charts and data on every
search, helping jobseekers make in-
formed decisions and setting us apart
from the competition.
PP: So who do you see as your com-
petitors?
AH: here are a number of other ver-
tical search engines that aggregate
content in a similar way, but we’re
taking the market to the next level by
bringing innovations in social and big
data to bear. Some sites are very US
focused, solely job driven, or simply
out-dated.
PP: How do you make money?
AH: We make money by referring
traﬃc to certain jobs sites that we list,
and from contextual advertising. Ads
are listed for free in the organic index,
with companies and portals having
the option to buy premium listings.
At this stage we are purely focussed
on building an excellent job search
experience that people want to use.
PP: What has been the most chal-
lenging time for the company?
AH: Since neither Doug (the other
founder) nor myself are ‘tekkies’, and
building a search engine is a massive
technical challenge, putting together
a crack squad of engineers to get Ad-
zuna off the ground on a shoestring
budget was tough. It took us a while
to ﬁnd the right “founding developer”
for Adzuna and we were starting to
stress that we might have to settle for
expensive (and not brilliant) contrac-
tors and freelancers.
PP: How did you overcome that?
AH: We managed to track down
George Karpodonis (whom we
worked with before at Gumtree), and
after kidnapping his family and em-
ploying a number of Jedi mind tricks
we eventually persuaded him to quit
his job and join us. George built ver-
sion 1 of Adzuna and has hired an A1
team around him in Athens to build
an increasingly awesome product.
PP: Being a start up and all... Can
you tell us a little about Adzuna
company culture?
AH: We think it’s essential to build a
great user experience. Keep focused.
Make your mother proud. And all
employees must wear ﬂip ﬂops if the
temperature is above 20o
C.
PP: Do you have any advice for our
entrepreneur students when deal-
ing with potential investors?
AH: Be honest, open and make sure
you can deliver a clear elevator pitch
(what you are doing, why it’s inter-
esting and how you’re going to make
money) in less than 30 seconds. If you
are fortunate enough to be able to
choose investors, make sure you go
with people you trust, your interests
are aligned and you trust each other,
as you’re likely to be working with
these people for a number of years
through good times and bad.
PP: What is the best piece of advice
anyone has ever given you?
AH: If you want to build something
massive and amazing, get something
small and cool out there that people
can use and play around with as soon
as possible. Don’t be precious about
version 1, it’s not going to be perfect.
Getting early feedback (from real
people, not your mum) is absolutely
critical.
In a time where unemployment and
crisis have been some of the most
heard words in our daily life, this
team shows that it is possible to see
problems as opportunities, and devel-
op creative business models as solu-
tions for them.
his month Adzuna successfully
launched in Germany, the ﬁrst stop
on its international expansion plan,
plus revenues have been doubling
every 3 months throughout 2012 and
2013, signalling a bright future ahead.
If you’re interested in joining this
young company they are currently
looking for interns passionate about
online and not afraid of a bit of hard
work. If you think you have what it
takes drop them an email at
