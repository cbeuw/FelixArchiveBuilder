Felix and Democracy
To what extent is Felix a democratic body? Can it claim to
represent the wider student body? Navid Nabijou investigates
ast night I was browsing
he Big Elections website,
pondering my choices
of candidates. I decided
to watch the Meet the
Candidates video: partly because I
was getting a bit lost amidst the end-
less succession of naïve and generic
manifestos, but mostly for the come-
dic gold I’d been hearing about (“it’s
known that most young men will
engage in an element of burlesque in
their lives…”). I should mention at
this point that if you haven’t already
seen the video I couldn’t recommend
it highly enough.
During the sofa sit-down with the
candidates for Felix Editor, our un-
ﬂappable host Frank posed a genu-
inely interesting question: “You’ve all
hit on the idea that Felix is the voice
of Imperial. Is not the student council
the voice of Imperial?”
he answers were broadly speaking
muddled and light on content, beﬁt-
ting of politicians on campaign. But
the question itself stuck with me. Is
Felix a representative voice? Does its
editorial policy reﬂect the views of the
wider student body?
To me the answer isn’t obvious.
On the one hand, Felix is ultimately
run by a very small group of people:
the Editor-in-Chief and the section
editors. hey basically get the last say
on which content goes in and which
doesn’t. hey also get to prioritise
certain articles over others, by giving
them greater prominence in terms of
layout. All this means that in principle
they could choose to disregard input
from the wider student body, and in-
stead use the paper as their own per-
sonal megaphone.
However in practice the editorial
policy is extremely open when com-
pared with other newspapers. We
view it as part of our duty to provide
L
a medium for student expression, and
as such we will only outright reject
articles in the most exceptional cases
(e.g. blatant racism or sexism). Of
course an inevitable consequence is
that a fair deal of substandard material
ﬁnds its way in; but this usually seems
preferable to excluding students from
what is, after all, their own newspaper.
But despite this editorial openness,
the majority of students probably
don’t view Felix as being ‘their own pa-
per’, in the sense that they don’t feel at
all engaged in the production process.
he pool of contributors – though
wider than the editorial team – is
still relatively small, with a few dozen
high-frequency writers ﬁlling the ma-
jority of column inches each week.
Despite the continual (and highly
inventive) “write for us” adverts that
appear each week encouraging people
to get involved, the unfortunate fact is
that the paper is by and large created
by a close-knit group of people. To
what extent this is alienating to oth-
ers I’m not sure (the candidates were
also asked “how do you intend to stop
Felix becoming just an in-joke for the
people who write it?” so maybe this
is an issue people have raised) but in
either case it certainly means that the
paper isn’t representative of the stu-
dents in any direct sense.
What happens instead then is a
form of self-selection. he students
who want their voices to be heard,
and who care enough to put in the
required time are those whose views
are put out there. he rest – the ‘silent
majority’, to channel Richard Nixon –
get sidelined.
And so in many ways, representa-
tion through Felix resembles repre-
sentation in any democratic system,
where – despite every vote being
equal – the politically-engaged class-
es inevitably end up dominating the
discussion. Which brings me back to
the original question: “Is the proper
voice of students Felix, or the Union
Council?”
As with Felix, there is a massive self-
selection element at play in terms of
who sits on Council; your average Im-
perial student probably hasn’t heard
of, much less cares about the Union
Council. Consequently the kind of
people who attend Council and vote
on Union policies can hardly said to
be representative.
But they’re elected by the wider stu-
dent body, right? hat has to count for
something. While they are technically
elected, these polls don’t take place
during the ‘Big Elections’ season (an
omission you may not have noticed
this week), and so tend to have dis-
mal turnouts; most people on Union
Council hold that position by virtue
of fewer than one hundred votes. By
contrast, the Felix Editor is a sabbati-
cal position that is very publicly con-
tested during campaign weeks, and
the winner usually receives a mandate
of a few thousand votes.
Finally, any student can turn up
to the Felix office and get writing,
whereas non-Council members do
not have any power to inﬂuence the
Union’s decisions. So Felix is crucial
in empowering ordinary students
to make an impact, inasmuch as it
provides a medium for bringing im-
portant issues to the attention of the
Union and sparking discussion within
the student body. And while it may
never be fully representative of all
students, every student has the abil-
ity to make it more representative, by
heading down to the office and getting
stuck in.
Is Felix a rep-
resentative
voice? Does
its editorial
policy reflect
the views of
the widers
student body?

In response to “Julian Assange in
Sweden”, 8th March:
This hero worship of Julian As-
sange is rather particular, but not
perplexing. There is a creation of
an enigma about the image of As-
sange, which is inconsistent with
the persona that is known about As-
sange. He is given more credit than
he deserves. All the information
relating to Assange’s legal problem
in Sweden is readily available. The
irony comes in that glossing over or
outright ignoring the circumstanc-
es relating to those problems. Peo-
ple are will readily point out that
Sweden gave Assange permission to
leave Sweden, but also told him that
the investigation was on going and
there was an interview arranged be-
fore his left Sweden. Being a leader
of a organization promoting trans-
parency and advocating whistle
blowing, it is strange that Assange
takes a different stance when it
comes to him. It is sad that Wikile-
aks has become all about Assange’s
personal agenda.
In response to “Griﬀon Studios, up to
scratch?”, from the archive:
I would strongly advise anyone who
is looking at accommodation options
NOT to book accommodation with
Gradpad. I am currently a resident at
Griﬀon Studios, and my experience
has been absolutely terrible and has
aﬀected my studies. I really don’t want
anyone else to fall into this trap. Was
moved against my wishes to a diﬀer-
ent accom to the one I booked In-
ternet doesn’t work hey lose rent
payments All appliances in my room
have broken, takes up to a month to
get them ﬁxed
In response to “here is something in
the air” 1st March:
Your comparison to homophobia is
both inappropriate and oﬀensive. a)
Your choice to smoke is not (in any
way) similar to being homosexual;
the latter is not a choice. b) While
some people may ﬁnd homosexuality
disgusting, walking past/being in the
vicinity of a homosexual does not ac-
tually impact their health. You don’t
seem to realise that by smoking in a
doorway (which provides you with
shelter), you are also increasing the
amount of smoke which passers-by
inhale, and which enters the building.
You make a good ﬁnancial case for al-
lowing people to continue to smoke,
so I’m happy for you to do so in the
street, but College is free to have its
own smoking policy (and indeed as
an institution actively involved in
medical research, it should). By the
way, “College seems to be on the anti-
smoking warpath again” is a bit of an
exaggeration, considering all they’ve
done is remind people of the existing
smoking policy.
Angry? Write us a letter explain-
ing why and you could be the proud
owner of a £10 note!
