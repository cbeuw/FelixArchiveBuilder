FRIDAY 15 MARCH
mething we don’t?
Pacific Rim
Release Date: July 12th
Director: Guillermo Del Toro
Cast: Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi, Idris Elba, Charlie Day, Ron Perl-
man, Burn Gorman, Clifton Collins Jr.
his one’s not set too far in the future, so hang on to your hats. Irritat-
ingly, portals to other dimensions keep opening and letting giant monsters
(‘kaiju’) through to planet Earth. hese monsters have a habit of destroying
Earth’s cities, so the human nations retaliate by building giant robots (‘Jae-
gers’ – not aﬃliated with the clothes store) to ﬁght oﬀ the beasts. However,
there are more and more portals opening, and the world’s resources are
getting low. Luckily, an old Jaeger pilot named Raleigh (Hunnam) and his
battered old Jaeger come back into battle to, hopefully, save the day. Seri-
ously – what’s not to like? his ﬁlm has ‘fabulous’ written all over it. he
eﬀects are going to be outstanding, better than any other giant robots ﬁlm,
and del Toro has added his skills to the project: the cast are fresh and keen,
and the visuals are heavily detailed. his could be something amazing – eat
your heart out, Transformers.
Star Trek Into Darkness (3D)
Release Date: May 17th
Director: J.J. Abrams
Cast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto,
Benedict Cumberbatch, John Cho,
Simon Pegg, Karl Urban, Anton
Yelchin, Zoe Saldana, Alice Eve,
Bruce Greenwood
It’s not looking good for London.
According to the oﬃcially re-
leased précis, in the 23rd century
an ‘unstoppable force of terror
from within their own organisa-
tion’ has detonated the Starﬂeet
– resulting in mega mayhem for
the world. he slightly egotistical
Captain Kirk (Pine) has his own
reasons to bring the ‘one man
weapon of mass destruction’ (the
ever-fabulous Cumberbatch) to
his knees – no matter what the
consequences for his own crew.
he last Star Trek movie was, we
can all agree, a wonderful success.
Living up to its hype, the last ﬁlm
attracted life-long followers and
new fans alike, bringing forward
a new generation of Trekkies – all
ready for this latest installment in
one of the world’s most successful
franchises. With the mood decid-
edly darker this time around, it’ll
be very interesting to see how to
new team fares against the bad
guy.
Riddick
Release Date: TBC
Director: David Twohy
Cast: Vin Diesel, Karl Urban, Ka-
tee Sackhoﬀ, Jordi Mollà, Nolan
Gerard Funk, Keri Hilson, Dave
Batista
Unfortunately for him, Richard
B. Riddick is left marooned on a
world full of horriﬁcally danger-
ous predators. But, luckily, Rid-
dick is played by Vin Diesel and
predictably kills everything in
sight and still looks bald and cool.
With that out the way, Riddick
must now save his home planet
Furya (furrier?) from destruction.
Busy busy. he production team
are promising a much better ﬁlm
that the poor Chronicles of Rod-
dick – with more violence, darker
themes and an R rating (UK not
decided yet) rather than a PG-
13. With the plot seeming a little
wishy washy, all we can hope is
that Diesel saves the day.
John Dies At The End
Release Date: March 22
Director: Don Coscarelli
Cast: Chase Williamson, Rob
Mayes, Paul Giamatti, Clancy
Brown, Doug Jones
Well that’s blown that, then. here
is nothing more annoying than
knowing what happens – it’s like
the start of Moulin Rouge all over
again. Mind you, this ﬁlm looks
so bad we’re not sure we mind
too much. Dave (Williamson)
and John (Mayes) are two col-
lege dropouts who discover that
a dodgy drug called ‘Soy Sauce’
is causing users to have seriously
weird hallucinations… and be-
come alien monsters who want to
destroy everything in their path.
Dave and John have to save the
day. And, presumably, John dies.
See – it doesn’t sound like a win-
ner. he director isn’t hugely well
known, nor are either of the leads
– but it may prove us wrong. Un-
likely though.
Elysium
Release Date: September 20th
Director: Neill Blomkamp
Cast: Matt Damon, William
Fichtner, Jodie Foster, Diego Luna,
Sharlto Copley, Talisa Soto
he year is 2159 and there are two
very distinct groups of people: the
wealthy, who live in lovely ﬂoating
cities with masses of security, and
the poor, who live down on the de-
stroyed and ravaged Earth’s sur-
face. Former criminal Max (Da-
mon) is forced to accept a mission
that could save his life, as well as
creating a fairer balance between
the rich and the poor. Consider-
ing Blomkamp’s last ﬁlm was the
highly commended District 9, his
follow-up is bound to be exciting.
he moral argument here (this
ﬁlm is deﬁnitely for the 99%) is an
interesting one, and Max’s mis-
sion is sure to be a testing one.
Damon is sure to be in his element
here, combining the two roles he
plays best: hard action man, and
guy for everyone.
Ender’s Game
Release Date: October 25th
Director: Gavin Hood
Cast: Asa Butterﬁeld, Harri-
son Ford, Abigail Breslin, Hailee
Steinfeld, Ben Kingsley, Viola Da-
vis, Moises Arias, Jimmy Pinchak,
Aramis Knight
An alien race called the Bug-
gers (no joke) has taken a dislike
to humanity and has had a good
go and wiping us out. Now the
leaders of the human race have
responded by creating a massive
ﬂeet ready for attacking, and are
currently searching the Earth for
the right people to lead it. In the
search for the necessary tactical
masterminds, they ﬁnd a possi-
ble contender in young Andrew
‘Ender’ Wiggins (Butterﬁeld). He
is transported to an orbiting Bat-
tle School to be trained by Colo-
nel Hyrum Graﬀ (Ford). he ﬁlm
is based on the 1985 novel of the
same name by Orson Scott Card,
which is a really good book (in
fact the whole series are really
good books) but hasn’t been made
into a movie until now for vari-
ous reasons (mostly some reason-
ably ﬁerce children ﬁghting each
other) some of which aren’t really
translatable to the screen. But, if
handled well, this could be an epic
ﬁlm, and lead to an excellent fran-
chise.
