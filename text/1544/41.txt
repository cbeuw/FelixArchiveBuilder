R
ecent email storms in-
volving the Imperial Col-
lege network have result-
ed in a sharp devaluation
of the Imperial email.
Where once an email had the same
value as half a face-to-face interac-
tion, the surge of emails in circulation
caused a huge slump; to now achieve
the same eﬀect as actually talking
to someone, it is estimated that you
would be required to send 10-15 iden-
tical emails. A spokesman for the
College stated that they were “work-
ing hard to revaluate the email” but
admitted that “it’s possible we may
have to abolish this form of telecom-
munications in the favour of an in-
stant-messaging service”. Attempts to
redenominate the email failed follow-
ing the second of two storms. Unhap-
py students were seen taking to the
Queen’s Lawn to protest the collapse
in web-based communications. One
student tweeted “If Imperial thinks
I’m going to ask people things direct-
ly, they’ve got another thing coming
#H8Talking”, whilst another posted a
Facebook message stating they would
“rather quit uni” than communicate
face-to-face. Rumours that some staﬀ
members, having long foreseen this
slump, have routinely refused to ac-
cept less than 3 or 4 emails before re-
plying, are, as yet, unconﬁrmed.
It has been conﬁrmed by our sourc-
es that many male students counted
the interaction with female students
as “the closest thing I’ve had to sex
all year. Unless you count that time
at that house party when someone
accidentally touched my chest while
gesticulating. Man, that was horny.”
A spokesman for College ICT was in
hiding and so couldn’t respond. Stu-
dents, known as ‘fucking morons or

Question: What do these things all
have in common?
Everybody knows I’m a mother-
fucking monster”
Just naming things with something
in common and then pointing it
out is not rapping. Terrible.

People laugh at you all the time?
To be fair you are a massive
loser. Anyway... Send stuff in:

removed from this list” are to all be
expelled due to being too stupid to
study at Imperial.
THE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS
ANTARCTIC CARAVAN
HOLIDAYS FAIL TO
ATTRACT FAMILIES
New cardinal not sure he’s
doing things right
Attending his ﬁrst Papal Conclave,
a visibly nervous Cardinal Fernando
Filoni seemed utterly unsure of him-
self as he entered the Sistine Chapel.
Looking around anxiously to check
what other cardinals were doing
whilst tugging on his cruciﬁx, the re-
cently anointed cardinal attempted
to maintain a brave face, despite the
unfamiliar settings. Trying not to trip
over his vestments as he crossed the
threshold to the chapel, Filoni was
seen trying to ask where he should be
sitting whilst adding in a tone of false
bravado that he “was simply asking
because he didn’t want to sit in some
newbies place”.
Snow out for vengeance
After a week in which warmer weather
inspired thoughts of summer, snow
swept back across northern Europe in
a show of swirling, white vengeance.
Reportedly angered by the presence
of sunlight and the absence of woolly
hats, the snow snapped on Tuesday
deciding to fall hard on the unsus-
pecting countries. Stating that closing
airports was “only the beginning”, the
crystalline precipitation proceeded to
allude to far more devastating actions
in the near future, adding, ominously
“soon”.
Shark-wrestling man fired by
children’s charity, hired by
dolphin pod
A 62 year-old man from South Wales,
who was ﬁred after his employers rec-
ognised him as the man who wrestled
a shark in Queensland, Australia, has
been hired this week by a dolphin pod.
Paul Marshallsea, who was supposed
to be on sick leave at the time of his
holiday, was reportedly disappointed
to be ﬁred from his role at the char-
ity, but said that he was “excited” to
be joining the pod. he Indian Ocean
based dolphins hope that Paul can put
his experience in hand-to-hand shark
combat to good use in the protection
of their newborn calves. “we saw the
video of Paul fearlessly taking on that
shark and thought he was exactly what
we were looking for” said pod-leader
squeaky before adding “and if he can
take out a few porpoises on the way,
all the better”.
