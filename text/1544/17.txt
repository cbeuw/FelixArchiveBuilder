FRIDAY 15 MARCH
”A science museum... in Birming-
ham?! HA!” is the typical response
received when I mention hinktank
Science Museum to anyone outside of
the West Midlands.
As regarding jokes about stupid-
ity which Midlanders are the butt
of, hinktank surely does not have a
place among them. Its passion to place
science in the spotlight, engage and
inspire really comes across.
As a volunteer, I get to explore the
museum for free, chat to behind-the-
scenes staﬀ, have access to unlimited
free tea, and 15% oﬀ in the gift shop.
Here’s what I make of the place.
Most exhibits do seem aimed at
children. For the very young are Kids’
City and he Street full of colour-
ful playthings. For older children,
and perhaps visitors less aware of the
medical world, a highlight is interac-
tive Medicine Matters, which demon-
strates surgery and invites the ques-
tioning of clinical policy.
My personal favourite is the natural
history section, and adults may par-
ticularly enjoy the Power Up Gallery,
which show oﬀ the majestic machines
which used to underlie the Industrial
Revolution.
he Planetarium is what every
visitor does not dare miss. Numbers
in queues far exceed seats available.
here is usually at least one show
aimed at adults, but most are targeted
at children. We volunteers put them
on and get to watch them for free –
usually the same on repeat. Being a
biologist and clueless about physics
thankfully makes this interesting.
Due to he Little Star hat Could
(for under elevens), I now know what
stars look like when they are ﬁrst born,
when very hot and “angry”, and even
when they concede to death. hanks
hinktank!
For the Planetarium’s manager,
Mario di Maggio, there is no me-
dium like a dome to engage with an
audience about science. “60% of the
world’s population will be living in
light-polluted cities by 2030. his
public service is more important than
ever. Digital planetariums ﬁll peo-
ou might think that hav-
ing eyes in the back of
one’s head was a quality
reserved only for moth-
ers and teachers, but
research published in he Journal of
Experimental Biology has shown that
it is also possible in tadpoles.
Biologists at Tufts University, Mas-
sachusetts, have created tadpoles with
ectopic eyes along the length of their
bodies by transplantation during early
embryonic stages. Importantly, these
eyes were shown to be functional in
19% of cases (a small but statistically
signiﬁcant result). Surprisingly, these
functional ectopic eyes did not send
their information directly to the brain
(as the optic nerve does in normal vi-
sion) but sent nerves to the spinal cord
instead.
Post-transplant tadpoles that made
the connection from their new eyes
to their spinal cord were able to ful-
ﬁl a simple light-based learning task.
When allowed to swim freely between
areas bathed in either blue or red light,
and given a small electric shock when
they entered the red zone, the tad-
poles learnt to avoid the red zone to
the same extent as their normal-eyed
counterparts.
hese results have potential signiﬁ-
cance in more ﬁelds than you might
think, from regenerative medicine to
engineering and robotics.
he authors have demonstrated
a high level of brain plasticity, par-
ticularly important in their tadpoles,
whose brains must cope with dramatic
morphological changes during their
lifetimes. he vertebrate brain cannot
only interpret visual information no
matter what part of the body it comes
from and without a direct connection,
but co-ordinate behaviour accordingly.
From an evolutionary perspective the
authors propose that plasticity of the
brain, rather than hardwiring, allowed
the animal to become more complex
without compromising its own ﬁtness.
A more abstract parallel is drawn
with robotics and computing: could
this research be relevant to the devel-
opment of networks that can adapt to
change or damage? Or alternatively,
can we learn from current methods
in data processing to ﬁgure out just
how electrical signals coming from the
body of an animal can still confer visual
information? For example, when a sig-
nal is sent, it contains a ‘header’, which
indicates where it came from and what
type of information it encodes.
It is clear that these new insights into
the connections between the verte-
brate brain and body could propel new
research in ﬁelds from artiﬁcial limbs
and regenerative medicine to engi-
neering, computing and beyond.

It is awesome that hinktank tries
to encourage young children to take
an interest in the science, but for me
it doesn’t quite cut it compared to the
exhibits at the Wellcome Collection,
NHM and Science Museum when
it comes to stimulating the curios-
ity of adults, and especially for adults
trained in science.
Special adult-only evenings are
sometimes run to ﬁll this niche.
hough yet to attend any, I hope to do
so, especially the Dome Club run by
the Planetarium team which recently
put on Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the
Moon with 360˚ visuals.
