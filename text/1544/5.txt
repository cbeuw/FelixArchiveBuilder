A London-based Hedge Fund, Bre-
van Howard, have decided to donate
£20.1 million ($30 million) to Imperial
College in order to set up a ﬁnance re-
search centre after them.
he money will be given to the Busi-
ness school at Imperial; the founder of
the hedge fund, Alan Howard, studied
Chemical Engineering at Imperial.
he research centre will be named
the Brevan Howard Centre for Fi-
nance. he focus of the research
centre has not yet been decided, it is
thought to incorporate the changes in
the ﬁnancial industry subsequent to
the economic crisis. Mr Howard com-
mented “I think the crisis has gener-
ated a diﬀerent set of questions that
have traditionally been taught in busi-
ness school.”
he hedge fund was founded by
Brevan Howard in 2002, it manages
approximately $39 billion. Last year,
the Sunday times estimated that Mr.
Howard’s personal wealth is about
$2,2 billion.

London based
Hedge Fund
donates £20m to
set up research
centre
Last week the new campus, Imperial
West, was launched at an event that
attracted the London Mayor, Boris
Johnson, and Universities & Science
Minister, David Willetts. At the event
the Mayor and the Minister took time
to have some hands on time with the
College’s latest research (including
the famous invisibility cloak) in an
event that attempted to display
the potential of the new campus.
he College used the oppor-
tunity as a “launch of the vision
for Imperial West”. he new site
in White City is being de-
scribed as a research
and translation
campus. Imperial
West will also in-
clude accommo-
dation for 600
postgraduates
and research-
ers, with
some having
already been
o c c u p i e d
since Sep-
tember.
he launch
event, with 700 attendees, began with
in the Great Hall with speeches from
the Chair of the College Council, Bar-
oness Manningham-Buller, and the
Rector & President, Sir Keith O’Nions.
Speaking at the event, Mr Willetts
said, “We’re used to thinking of Lon-
don as a great legal centre, as a great ﬁ-
nancial centre, as a great centre for cul-
ture, theatre and the arts, but London
is also one of the world’s great
centres for universities and
science”.
he formal event was
ended with a speech
from the Mayor in which
he laid out what he
thought Imperial West
could achieve.
He noted
that London
has always
been in the
centre of
scientific
discovery,
citing the
ﬁrst TV
set, ﬁrst
m a -
c h i n e
g u n
and Darwin’s theory of evolution.
He ﬁnished by saying that Impe-
rial researchers would make break-
throughs fundamentals of physics,
“why the heart goes boom, boom,
boom” and why toast falls butter-side
down. Mr Johnson also asked that
someone explained to him how “grav-
ity worked”.
Following the speeches, the mix of
politicians, business leaders and other
guests were led to a scientiﬁc exhibi-
tion in the Queen’s Tower Rooms.
here they were greeted by a cake in
the shape of the new campus, which
reportedly took 80hrs to make, and
a range of research displays. hese
included ultra-eﬃcient rechargeable
batteries, microchips incorporated
with DNA analysis, synthetic biosen-
sors and appetite regulation technol-
ogy.
he Mayor was reportedly keen to
try the “Harry Potter” style invisibility
cloak and both he and David Willetts
took turns to have a go. he cloak is
a result of the group researching me-
ta-materials. he Rector had already
noted that evening that the ability to
“disappear” may be a useful skill for
politicians.

Union Council
cancelled due to
lack of agenda
items
he latest meeting of Union Council
was cancelled as no agenda items had
been tabled. All of the Sabbatical’s re-
ports are online and were delivered on
time, much like Ashanti is.

Clariﬁcation:
Last week, in an article about
the Big Elections entitled “The
Big Elections 2013: the race is
on”, it stated that Christopher
Kaye informed Felix that “the
Returning Officers never replied
to him”. To clarify the meaning
of this: Kaye was stating that
the Returning Officers had not
replied to his speciﬁc retorts and
arguments about the use of the
words “Queen”, “fag” and “prat”
in a manner that he deemed
satisfactory. Felix acknowledges
that this could have been made
clearer and apologises to the
Returning Officers and Kaye for
this error.
