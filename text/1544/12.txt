Comments:
“A very kiddy egg. It tastes okay though. The egg
is, however, like a Rugby player’s penis: disap-
pointingly small.” “Pure, undefiled, a master egg.”
“Unassuming at first but then that kick of sugar
bewitches the mind and ensnares the senses.”

8/10
Chance of sexual stimulation
after eating:
Disappointingly low. Although, from the egg,
pretty high. The mini eggs were eggs-credible.
Better than using your hand.
Comments:
“Wish they had normal baby Lindts :(” “Choco-
late wise, egg was classic Lindt.” “Buff ting.”
“The 8 inch penis of the chocolate world.” “Or-
gasmic.” “Surprisingly shit.”
Creme Eggs
A perennial Easter favourite. They
have pearly white stuff inside that
you can suck dry. They causeda rift
in the office as a couple of people
thought they were average and
overrated. Twelve for £3.90, which
is 32.5p each. Value for money? You
decide.
