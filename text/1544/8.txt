8 FRIDAY 15 MARCH
Caffeine Culture
here are prices you pay
for obsessions, and
mine is a small, daily
coronary. This occurs
at some point between
the hours of 10.40 and 11.30am and,
like most heart conditions, is usually
triggered by anxiety, stress and/or
over-indulgence.
First, the anxiety. This begins to
mount the moment I have arrived at
the venue for the day’s hit and placed
my order. Initially, the apprehension
is a case study in twenty-first cen-
tury neuroses. Have I been precise
enough with my request (“a small
soya flat white with two shots” per-
haps, or “a medium-blend filter with
warm full-fat milk on the side”) or,
conversely, have I been so precise
that the barista might, reasonably,
hock in the milk? I scrutinise the
hapless Spaniard/PhD student/fu-
ture Oscar winner across the coun-
ter, and try desperately to read the
(strictly metaphorical) tea leaves.
The personality profiling gives way
to other concerns as I tend to the
plight of the milk: has it been taken
cold from the fridge or (horrors!) is
a tepid pitcher being reheated? How
high has it been filled and how low
has the steaming arm being thrust?
Is a thermometer being used, and if
not, how attentively is the heat be-
ing monitored? The cruelty of an ill-
attended jug! I empathise with that
scalded milk like it’s a fourteenth
century heretic at the stake.
By the time the milk is ready to be
Cappuccino: one third each of es-
presso, steamed milk and froth, usu-
ally sprinkled with chocolate.

friars.
ortunately my predica-
ment is shared by many the
world over. Coﬀee is now
the second most-traded
commodity in the world
(after crude oil) and 70 million cups
are drunk in the UK every day. 57%
of us now regularly drink in coﬀee
shops, and trade, particularly amongst
independents, is booming despite the
recession. Books, blogs, articles and
advice abound about where to ﬁnd the
best brew, and coﬀee is fast catching
up with wine in terms of the snobbery
of its aﬁcionados.
In fact, coﬀee and wine share much
in common, and it seems no coin-
cidence that the root of the English
word ‘coﬀee’ comes from an Arabic
term, qahhwat al-bun, meaning ‘wine
of the bean’. Like oenophiles, caﬀeine
heads would claim that their beverage
is an entire sensory experience: the
warmth of the cup between the hands;
the artistry in the collapsing hearts on
the cap of the foam, the smell of the
grind and its silky smoothness on the
tongue, coupled with the rich kick of
the coﬀee itself. Not to mention the
conversations. I am convinced I have
the best conversations when nursing a
cup of coﬀee.
And like the vine, the bean has quite
some background. he origins of the
drink itself lie in Ethiopia – with mys-
tics, goatherds or saints, depending on
which version you believe – roughly
around the turn of the thirteenth cen-
tury. It was not until the middle of the
ﬁfteenth century that coﬀee drinking
became a more regular practice, and
the ﬁrst coﬀee house would not open
in Britain for another two hundred
years.
But at this point, coﬀee got clout.
By the turn of the century some 3,000
coﬀee houses could be found in Lon-
don alone, where they became the hub
of the energised debates on religion
and politics that characterised the En-
lightenment. In America the heavy tax
on tea imposed by the British in 1773
Latte: espresso and steamed milk, tra-
ditionally served in a glass.
Etymology – classic hyperforeignism,
as the word has no Italian roots: ask
for a latte in Milan and you will get a
cup of milk.
Flat white: not just a small latte! he
change in proportions (more espres-
so to milk) tend to make this cousin
punchier; milk is used from the bot-
tom of the pitcher too, resulting in less
froth and more silk.
Etymology – arguably our Antipodean
neighbours’ greatest cultural contri-
bution, the term was coined in Sydney
in the 1980s and made it to Starbucks,
London, in 2010.
Americano: espresso added to hot wa-
ter, which creates a ‘crema’ or velvety
brown surface. Distressingly often con-
fused with ﬁlter coﬀee, but the prepara-
tion of an espresso extracts more ﬂa-
vour from a bean than does ﬁltering; the
ﬂipside of this is the potential for acidity.
Etymology – a word developed in World
War II to describe the drink made by
American troops, who added hot water
to their espressos.
Filter: brewed coﬀee (ideally single
origin) ﬁltered by gravity rather than
force, often described by strength (e.g.
mild, very strong), and even more of-
ten demeaned by baristas who leaving
it sweating for hour upon hour.
Etymology – you are clearly under-caf-
feinated. Look at the description.

Party’, with Americans switching from
leaves to beans, and coﬀee becoming
the symbolic drink of freedom. his
may be the most grandiose demon-
stration of the link between coﬀee and
liberty, but even today there is a whiﬀ
of rebellion and sophistication in the
moment when an adolescent starts to
spurn the PG in favour of the Nescafé.

tied to egalitarianism and independ-
The French philosopher Voltaire
reportedly drank fifty cups of cof-
fee a day
poured I’m at the clammy-handed,
sweat-between-the-breasts stage
that Tesco directors must experience
when receiving the DNA results of
their beef burgers. How fast, how
close to the lip of the mug, how deep
from the base of the pitcher, whether
wrist or hand is being used to slalom
the milk… in such crucial details lie
the destiny of the brew.
If anxiety and/or stress have not
done me by this stage, it may be cof-
fee worthy of the name, coffee that
justifies the 5,500-odd miles the
beans have likely flown to reach my
mug. And if it is, what rhapsody!
All the drizzle and examinations in
the world could not ruin the morn-
ing, as I sip and slurp and cradle the
blend… until, that is, the thought
occurs that one dose is simply not
enough. If just a few minutes ago
my student-self was wincing at the
petty change from the fiver, now I’m
reasoning that it’s just a third of last
night’s gin-and-tonic and entitles me
to a good forty minutes of free cen-
tral heating.
Within half an hour, body and
brain are untethering from each
other like whippet and leash. My
ribcage is being clamped by an im-
placable force, while my mind skit-
ters over thoughts, ideas, plans like
an overexcited Olympic hurdler.
For the next couple of hours only a
nuclear attack or a car parking fine
would be capable of making me fo-
cus. And I don’t own a car.
