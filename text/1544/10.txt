10 FRIDAY 15 MARCH
A Love for business
s I walk into the airy
Business School on time
for a meeting (for once),
I wonder where any of-
ﬁces could be. Having
snuck in by nefarious means, attempt-
ing to be clandestine as I tailgate an
unsuspecting accomplice, I realise
that the furthest I’ve ever been into
the Business School is the café.
Colin Love is a slight rarity really.
He’s friendly, speaks his mind, and
is honest: Paxman would be a bit
shocked when he just answers a ques-
tion straight. If titles were gold, he’d
have Fort Knox in his oﬃce some-
where. He is: Principal Teaching Fel-
low – meaning his academic focus is
on teaching; Director of Undergradu-
ate Studies at the Business School; Di-
rector of the MSc Strategic Marketing;
Marketing Director for the Business
School.
“My big focus is going to be on re-
cruitment for the Business School,
and developing a social media strat-
egy, which I think is going to revolu-
tionise the way we talk to students.”
He explains this is because “we know
that students only want to be spoken
to really through social media... not
brochures and posters”.
He is very exited about the new pro-
ject that the Business School have.
“his summer in July we are going to
launch a summer school. We are go-
ing to launch it under the heading of
Strategic Marketing. It will to be an
intensive, one month course. In total...
it adds up to about 170 hours. It’s go-
ing to be open to Imperial undergrad-
uates, and international undergradu-
ates.” he course will be residential,
and costs £2000, which Love says
“believe it or not that’s competi-
tive!”. he ﬁrst pilot will have
over 50 students and he is sure it
will be successful.
Why are you doing this at all
is the next question I ask. Love
answers that it serves several pur-
poses. “It’s a fantastic ad-
vertisement for College.
I’ve got to tell the
truth: it’s a revenue
stream – we’re go-
ing to make cash
out of it. But the
main thing is
the College
r e c o g n i -
tion. We
are heavily trading on the reputation
of Imperial around the world.” It’s al-
ready been launched on the web and
has had 2000 hits in a week. He says
it is open to Imperial students, but
expects mostly American, Indian and
Chinese students. It will be “equiva-
lent to three USA credits or 7 ETCS”.
“he incentives are two things: one is
credit from their home university...
the other thing you get of
course is you get to
go to London for a
whole month.” “We
want to employ
some ambassa-
dors to help look
after these guys
in the so-
cial playground”. Discussing Imperial
students he touches on the possibility
of a discount saying “I’d like to”.
Love is proud of the Business School
and its reach. “We teach nearly 3000
students”. On the subject of the Hori-
zons Business course, he explains that
the 8 week programme has been lec-
tured to 800+ students and is the most
popular course. He says that this is set-
ting them up for second and third year.
“In the past we had something called
BEST... I think that got kind of tired,
and we’ve done a major reengineering
exercise with science and engineering
science. he new programme will be
called Business for Professional Engi-
neers and Science. We are extending
the number of subjects from ﬁve to
nine”. New options will include Busi-
ness Strategy, Marketing, Sustainable
business, amongst others. hey will
be for credit and electives, with 15
hours of face-to-face and ﬁve hours
online. He says that this is “huge”
as they are expecting about 2000
students to register for those
courses. He also mentions the
intercollated masters that stu-
dents can take.
Love discusses the way that
the Business School can reach any
undergraduate at Imperial. “If you
join Imperial College, as a scientist,
engineer, or medic, when you ﬁnish
you’ve got lots of additional things
on your CV. You’ve done a Business
foundation course under Horizons,
you’d have taken a series of electives,
you may have taken a year in manage-
ment.” He says “what we’re doing is
give someone something additional...
like the humanities, you want to do
a language, that’s a skill”. He explains
that employers look at the business
knowledge and that these courses will
“get them huge jobs”.
“More and more business people
now, when they look at CVs, they’re
looking at personal statements, they
are looking to see what people have
done outside of their specialist sub-
ject.”
Love ends with a tour of the Busi-
ness School’s online learning plat-
form. It’s pretty amazing and I wish
I’d had that as an undergraduate. He
jovially says goodbye to me. I walk out,
realising that I never did any Business
School courses, and therefore can feel
slightly hipster in a few years time
when everyone is.
Definitions redefined at TEDx
LSE

Last Friday saw only the second ever
independently organised TED event
at the London School of Economics.
he day promised talks, performanc-
es and workshops selected to encour-
age us to ‘Redeﬁne our Deﬁnition’,
and it certainly delivered.
he ﬁrst of the day’s offerings was
part talk part performance coming
courtesy of geek songstress Helen Ar-
ney. An alumnus of Imperial College,
Arney shared her theory that comedy
and science are natural bedfellows,
something she went on to brilliantly
demonstrate by playing the audience
her obituary in song form, accom-
panying herself on the ukelele. his
was my single most enjoyable talk of
the day and a welcome reminder that
your degree can take you anywhere in
this world.
Rob Symington’s talk was a breath
of fresh air for an Imperial student
like me. He began by retelling the
story of how he “accidentally ended
up with a well paid city job”. It was
incredible to hear him describe his
fear of revealing to his colleagues
that he was unsatisﬁed where he was.
Fast forward a few years and Rob now
heads up Escape the City, a service
which takes disgruntled city work-
ers and connects them to inspiring
and fulﬁlling opportunities around
the world. Rob’s was a story of fear-
of-the-unknown and overcoming the
voice in your head that tells you to
stay put. It left me inspired and more
determined than ever to bin the ca-
reer’s spam that plagues my Imperial
inbox.
By far the talk that left the biggest
impact on me was Kyra Maya Phil-
lips’s. As we ﬁled into the theatre to
begin the third session, we were all
handed a pirate’s eye-patch. It’s safe
to say few knew what to expect. Kyra
drew inspiration from two arche-
types to argue that if we refuse to
confront and understand the darker
side of our nature, we cannot hope
to ever improve ourselves and the
things around us. It was the swash-
buckling, plundering pirates who ﬁrst
experimented with democratic rule
on their ships. hey were the victims
of cruel totalitarian systems of rule
and were determined to ﬁnd an alter-
native. Instead of ignoring those peri-
ods of darkness, they embraced them
as a catalyst for change. he second
archetype is the computer hacker, the
‘people who can’t ﬁght the itch to ﬁx
and improve’. To achieve their goals,
they must ﬁrst dismantle and un-
derstand the intricacies of a system.
Phillips argues that we must take the
same approach to the parts of our-
selves that limit us, the parts that
scare and hinder us; our ‘dark sides’.
Hearing how this approach had
helped Kyra overcome depression in
her own life was perhaps the most af-
ﬁrming part of a moving an heartfelt
talk that left the audience rapt.
Beyond the talks, the event was a
very slick affair. he team behind it,
who are wholly student led, deserve
heaps of praise for putting together
a range of speakers that were diverse
in content, background and approach
but united in the underlying TED
spirit of ideas worth sharing.
I for one can’t wait for next year’s
TEDxLSE. Before that, however, Im-
perial has an independent TED event
of its own...
