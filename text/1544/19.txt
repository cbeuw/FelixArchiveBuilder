FRIDAY 15 MARCH
Wasp waists and vibrant colours took
the Balmain girls back to the days of glam
rock this season, as attitude became as
much a requirement as power shoulders
and rich jewels. Leather was worn paral-
lel to glimmering diamonds, shimmering
sapphires and peacock coloured silks as,
once again, Rousteing worked his magic
in toughening the luxurious and turning
seemingly unwearable ideas into pieces
coveted by the nouveau rich. Prepare
to embrace the gleaming new cult of
Balmain.

It is almost a fact taken for granted now
that Sarah Burton will bring to each and
every fashion week the most elaborate
show, and this time round she most
definitely did not disappoint. Where
Burton’s collection lacked in number
(there were just ten looks), it made up
for in extravagance. Tightly fitted head
cages replaced spring’s wide honey-col-
lector hats this autumn, implicative of
the womb and the protection a mother
might bestow upon a child; reminding
us that Burton designed the collection
whilst in the last stages of her pregnancy.
To describe this season’s garments as
embellished would be a blasphemous
understatement, almost every garment
seemed to be constructed solely from
glittering pearls. Of course, the collec-
tion would not be true to McQueen
without exaggerated silhouettes, yet
here too Burton surpassed expectations.
Fetish-like corsets led to hourglass hips
as angel-puffed sleeves floated above
tiers of laced pleats. Somewhere be-
tween Elizabethan royalty and future
surrealism, metal fishnets collided with
high-necked ruffles creating a truly ex-
traordinary collection suited for such
miraculous times.

The little sister line of Marc Jacobs may
have surprisingly usurped its mainline
sibling on more than just the timetable of
NYFW this season. The adverse weather
that forced the designer to showcase
Marc by Marc Jacobs in lieu of the origi-
nal Marc Jacobs show timetabled suc-
cessfully ushered the 70s back into the
limelight.
Sleek A-line dresses complemented
radiant voluminous hair as ravishing
red lips boosted the elegance of blocked
colours. The looks were enticingly pol-
ished, almost secretarial in fact, but with
an added dash of confidence and enig-
matic intelligence. Alluringly elegant, Mr
Jacobs showed that sometimes, the sim-
plest ideas are the most effective.
