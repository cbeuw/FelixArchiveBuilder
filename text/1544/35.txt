FRIDAY 15 MARCH
36
A tale of two all nighters
long time ago, in a Un-
ion room far, far away
an intrepid young fresh-
er decided to attend her
ﬁrst all-nighter. Young
and innocent, this girl did not know
what to expect and this is the magi-
cal, mystifying tale of what she found
there...
Well maybe magical and mystify-
ing aren’t quite the right words, when
you consider that the long time ago
happened to be Christmas, and that
the Union Concert Hall in Beit re-
ally isn’t that far away. But I digress.
I shall set the scene. A young, fresh
faced girl considers her options for
the last week of term. She suspects
that it may well be spent in an alco-
hol induced haze, as the nights out
and nights in when you’ve drunk too
much to get out continue. But instead
she ﬁnds herself in a room thick with
the smell of popcorn and hot dogs as
she prepares to watch the ﬁrstofmany
exciting ﬁlms she has been waiting
to see. he rose tinted memories of
this night are ﬁlled with the happy
joyous laughter of those running on
caﬀeine and sugar as they enjoy the
incredible, emotional moments of
Madagascar 3. Or the fear that ﬁlled
the room at six in the morning as the
sleep deprived enjoyed the delights of
Cabin in the Woods. But her memo-
ries are also ﬁlled with the camara-
derie of those participating in the
event. he half joking, half intensely
ﬁerce competition over the prime
seating, those desirable marked out
with layers of blankets and pillows
as the owners queue up for food. he
quizzical look shared by all with the
realisation that the Sainsbury’s basic
chicken and mushroom pot noodles
are vegetarian, but the chicken ones
alone are not. And her personal fa-
vourite, the three in the morning
‘who can drink the most sugary tea’
competition with a complete stran-
ger, whilst engaging in a conversation
on the comparisons between the ﬁlm
and the novel of Perks a Being a Wall-
ﬂower. And does she regret this deci-
sion, despite having lectures the next
day? Not in the slightest.
But this is a new term with a new
all-nighter. his has been a good
term for the cinema, with three ﬁlms
doing particularity well. First we
showed the romantic comedy Sil-
ver Linings Playbook. I’m sure it was
noticeable in many ways, one being
that it was a romantic comedy that
didn’t make me want to run away and
hide at the over repeated clichés, but
it also featured Jennifer Lawrence.
And it is hard not to love a girl who
fell over on the steps whilst trying to
collect her Oscar for this ﬁlm. Next
it was Argo. he ﬁlm that, through
careful manipulation of the facts
made America look great and every-
one else look a bit rubbish. But even
knowing that, I was amazed by how
much Ben Aﬄeck made me care for
characters that I thought were ini-
tially unlikable, to the point that I felt
relief when the ending that I knew
was coming from the start of the
ﬁlm ﬁnally arrived. he last ﬁlm was
showed that had the audience run-
ning in their droves was Life of Pi. In
case you haven’t read the book/ seen
the trailer or even the poster, this ﬁlm
asks the question. ‘What would hap-
pen if a boy was trapped on a lifeboat
with a tiger?’ With stunning visuals
and a great score (hello Mr Oscar for
both), this ﬁlm was perhaps my per-
sonal favourite of the three. Now you
may have noticed, oh observant read-
er, that these ﬁlms have something in
common. Each one was nominated
for the best picture Oscar, and in the
case of Argo, even won it.
So we took the common denomina-
tor of ‘People like Oscar best picture
nominees’ and we stuck not one, not
even two, but four into the set list
for the Spring All-Nighter. Lincoln,
Django Unchained, Les Miserable
and Zero Dark hirty. After Lincoln,
that Americany, presidenty Spielber-
gy ﬁlm you will probably feel like an
expert on American history. So what
better way to test your new found
knowledge with the history exam
that is Abraham Lincoln: Vampire
Hunter?
Django Unchained alone is worth
watching: ﬁlled with Tarantino’s
signature wit and chaotic bravado
as seen in the likes of Pulp Fiction,
coupled with darker insinuations
about racism in America, the ﬁlm
also features stunning performances
from German dentist turned bounty
hunter Dr King. Schultz aka Chris-
toph Waltz in an Oscar winning role
and Leonardo DiCaprio in an out of
character turn as a nefarious slave
owner. Despite what you make of his
recent eﬀorts, Django is a deﬁnite re-
turn to form.
We’ve also got Les Mis. his is the
only ﬁlm I am aware of with a trailer
that has made someone cry, which
probably says something about how
sad it is. And that’s just the trailer.
Bring your wellies guys, the ﬂoor
will be sopping from the tears of
grown men moved to cry by Anne
Hathaway’s raw and unintentionally
hot performance. We’re charging £1
a hankie. For the tears, you under-
stand.
We’re also screening Zero Dark
hirty directed by Kathryn Bigelow-
the ﬁlm cashing in on the hunt to
catch Osama Bin Laden. Based on in-
sider ﬁles that may or not have been
dubiously authorised by the US gov-
ernment, the ﬁlm follows the hunt to
ﬁnd Bin Laden through the eyes of a
front-line CIA oﬃcial as it gradually
consumes her life. he conclusion
which let’s face it, doesn’t take a geni-
us to ﬁgure out, somehow manages to
be nerve-bitingly tense and gripping.
Just ignore the mildly insuﬀerable
America Fuck Yeah! message and you
can enjoy how Bigelow’s crafted an
intense, thrill-ride of a movie.
he last ﬁlm is famous for the num-
ber of Oscars it won. Best Vampire,
Most Historically Accurate, Best
Overacting, Silliest Fight Scene and
Best Axe Swinging at a Tree to men-
tion but a few. Wait, you don’t re-
member these awards? Maybe it was
all a dream after all. I did think meet-
ing Jennifer Lawrence was too good
to be true.
So there it is. A chance to see ﬁve
ﬁlms for the price you would usually
pay to see one. And a decent excuse
to miss lectures the next day. So what
are you waiting for, book your tickets
now. I’ll see you there!
