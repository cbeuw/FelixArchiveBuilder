To summarise, The Jacket is – at
best – mildly diverting. I found the
script weak, leading to a lot of loose
beginnings, an implausible plot, and
the whole thing was slow moving
until the end. Yawn.
The actors were good but mis-
cast. Keira Knightley is adequate
as the drunken trailer trash but
there’s little, if any, on-screen chem-
istry between her and Adrien Brody.
Brody does well in his character, but
the film as a whole doesn’t fit well
together.
By the end of it, The Jacket is
one of those “in the future you can
change your past” films. Brody, on
good form, is cast as an ex-soldier
who loses his memory and ends
up committed to an asylum for the
criminally insane, after being falsely
accused of murder. Enter wacko
doctor who locks him in a morgue
drawer, strapped in a strait jacket
and jacked up with some banned
drugs for a few hours. The aim: to
rid Brody of his supposedly violent
tendencies. What actually happens:
Brody can travel into the future.
And when he does, he finds out he
is going to die in four days, so he
tries to find out who kills him and,
one supposes, stop this event. There
are a lot of loose beginnings here,
which seem to be the parts where
the scriptwriters think: “OK so this
guy killed him!” and then change
their mind to the other one, then
to the other guy and then... without
changing the mini-climaxes dotted
around the place.
Knightley is a disjointed link to a
little girl who becomes his romantic
in the future (where he hasn’t aged),
and his reverse clairvoyant who
helps him find out who kills him.
There’s a lot going on that doesn’t
have anything to do with where the
film is going, which is where I was
disappointed. I do nitpick more than
average, so maybe if you decide to
part with seven or eight quid you
will find the film more rounded.
And how slow can a film start? I
was itching for it to finish for a good
hour until the ten minutes where
it got slightly interesting. It is only
towards the end that you can get
immersed slightly into the film, and
begin to follow the characters with
more interest. However this doesn’t
last long and the ending is too soppy
for me. Give me a Clint Eastwood
boxing flick any day of the week!
Final say from me? Don’t both-
er waiting for the DVD either
(unless you like Hollywood’s obtuse
attempts at making the audience
“think outside the box” or whatever
rubbish they come up with). Oh, and
it’s not scary either, so there’s no
point taking your girlfriend for the
‘gripping-moments-in-the-cinema’
thing. Amadeus Stevenson

Mind-numbing stuff
Jennifer Lopez in a decent movie? It can’t be true
I know what you’re thinking...
Jennifer Lopez and movies don’t
go very well together. Well yes, in
the recent past this has proven true
with celluloid disaster after cellu-
loid disaster. However, this time,
she may just have managed to come
good. Her new film is Monster-in
Law and it is modern take on a very
old tale... girl meets boy, they fall
in love, girl meets boy’s psycho
mother. So there is no surprise that
what ensues is a sweet comedy with
a little romance, a lot of scream-
ing and quite a few right (and left)
hooks.
‘Jenny from the Block’ stars as
Charlie, a loveable if directionless
twenty-something looking for love.
She meets Kevin, a handsome rich
surgeon who wants to treat her like
a lady. Meanwhile, Kevin’s success-
ful newswoman mother Viola (Jane
Fonda) is blissfully unaware of her
son’s new relationship. This is part-
ly due to her very public and very
funny nervous breakdown which
leads to her being committed to a
psychiatric hospital. So when Kevin
and Charlie get engaged, Viola
decides that Charlie is all wrong
for her son and sets about driving
her away.
Lopez does what she does best,
playing the adorable and quirky
heroine who is hindered in reaching
romantic bliss by her loveless past.
Michael Vartan (Alias) and Lopez
shine brightly as the two young lov-
ers but without being too syrupy
and with just enough chemistry.
The comedy is provided through
the friction between mother and
daughter-in-law beautifully. Jennifer
Lopez actually has very good comic
timing and her slow but convinc-
ing conversion from innocent bride-
to-be to irate daughter-in-law is
very well done. Her tussles with
Viola are naturally the highlight of
the film and Jane Fonda is fabu-
lous. Completely over the top and
glamorous, she manages to dem-
onstrate Viola’s ferocity as well as
clearly showing her insecurity of
being left out of her son’s life. Her
crazy schemes to drive Charlie
away draw a lot of laughs but it is
her interaction with her long-suf-
fering personal assistant that really
makes this film hilarious.
Ruby (Wanda Sykes) brings to life
Viola’s often ignored conscience,
providing a voice of reason to her
boss’s madness. Ruby’s dry humour
contrasts beautifully with Viola’s
histrionics.
The storyline is a little thin on the
ground but is just about enough to
carry the film through. The auxil-
iary characters in the movie are not
really utilised and I think Charlie’s
gay best friend was just a little too
clichéd. That said, the supporting
cast did do their best and did man-
age to provide a few extra laughs.
The film starts off well enough
but somehow actually manages to
miss out the meat and bones of any
romantic comedy – the ‘falling in
love bit’ that all the girls out there
want to see. I guess this helps to
make the film less saccharine and
more about getting the audience
laughing. And it’s not so bad, as the
film compensates by focusing on
the relationship between the two
women.
So Monster-in-Law is funny, it
is sweet and, if on one of these
lazy hazy sunny days that is what
you’re looking for, it definitely comes
through. M K Osakonor
