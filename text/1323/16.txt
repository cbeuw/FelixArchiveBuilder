Ong Bak is a martial arts film with
a difference in its making – the
film’s witty slogan reads: “No stunt
doubles, no computer images, no
strings attached.” And if this holds
true, it sure is an amazing piece of
work.
The film, in Thai with English sub-
titles, follows the story of Ting (Jaa),
a villager who travels to Bangkok
to retrieve the head of his village’s
Buddha statue from an evil busi-
nessman. His travels lead him to
his cousin Humlae (Wongkamlao),
who has become embroiled in
Bangkok’s unsavoury underworld of
drugs, gambling and sex. Humlae
decides to help his cousin retrieve
the Buddha’s head and this film fol-
lows their adventure.
The film is littered with typical
clichés about the importance of
respect, loyalty, religion and family
relationships, but despite this it is
hugely enjoyable. Maybe because
the clichés are thrown in with a
huge dose of humour and comedic
dialogue, but also because the film
can just... pull it off somehow. Every
actor delivers a strong performance
(apart from perhaps Yodkamol’s
delivery of Muay, which was very
over-the-top and slightly unbear-
able at times) and the settings are
perfect in bringing the script to life
as we fluctuate from smoky drug-
den-cum-wrestling-arena to hidden
mountain caverns.
The main thing that was impres-
sive about this film were the fight
scenes – and were they something
to behold. Although the film boasts
that all of the fighting and action
sequencesweredonewithoutstrings
and stunt doubles (some stunts
were shown two or three times from
different camera angles to prove
this), it made the actual fighting no
less plausible – expect much of the
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-
esque scenes of incredible jumps,
leaps and kicks. What really brought
the fight scenes together and made
them so enjoyable, however, was the
humour that was weaved through-
out the whole sequence – at sev-
eral points throughout the movie,
the entire audience in the cinema
were loudly laughing as the fight
scene unfolded on screen. Despite
the blatant impossibility of it all, it is
genuinely enjoyable to watch once
you realise that the film is not taking
itself entirely seriously either.
The well-crafted fight scenes
had some trademarks reminiscent
of both Jackie Chan and Jet Li,
employing the flexibility and the
suaveness of the former and the
deftness and killer moves of the lat-
ter. However, instead of gracefully
lethal Wu-Shu or Shaolin Kung Fu
fighting, we see the rawness and
energy behind Muay Thai (Thai
kickboxing) which is an interesting
variation but may just get a little
too much for your liking. Although
most of the fight scenes were highly
entertaining to watch, there is only
so much relentless Thai kickboxing
you can see before you start to get
a little bored, and the fact that the
character development of the main
star seemed to lag a little did not
help matters – Ting seemed far too
noble for any hero and although his
sincerity was supposed to be inspir-
ing, it was actually rather corny.
Overall, though, this film was defi-
nitely an enjoyable one to watch – I
would highly recommend it to any
Jackie Chan or Jet Li fan or some-
one who enjoys films with plenty of
meaty fight scenes. In fact, I’d rec-
ommend it to anyone who is up for a
laugh – this film certainly had me in
fits of laughter throughout.

Helen Hunt plays the scarlet woman
Mrs Erlynne, who wrecks happy
households by sleeping with peo-
ple’s husbands for money. When
she realises that her game is up
in New York, she leaves for Italy
where her life becomes intertwined
with the Windermere couple. Lord
Windermere and Lady Windermere
(Scarlett Johansson) are the golden
couple of the town; married only
for a year, they are still apparently
very much in love with each other.
However, their marriage becomes
complicated with the arrival of Mrs
Erlynne and Lord Darlington.
Lord Darlington, an interna-
tional playboy, is attracted to Lady
Windermere’s innocence and naive-
ty, so he decides to steal her from
her husband. Lady Windermere,
innocent to a fault, misjudges Lord
Darlington’sintentionsanddecidesto
makehimherfriend.Simultaneously,
Mrs Erlynne has a chance encoun-
ter with Lord Windermere in an
antique store. After this encounter,
Lord Windermere is spotted visiting
Mrs Erlynne every day by the local
gossip lady, Lady Plymdale (Diana
Hardcastle). Lord Darlington, ever
the opportunist, uses this informa-
tion to instil seeds of doubt in Lady
Windermere’s mind about her hus-
band. With his help, she discovers
that her husband has been giving
Mrs Erlynne a huge sum of money
and jumps to the conclusion that her
husband has been unfaithful. Lady
Windermere is now thrown into a
dilemma as she realizes that her
husband and her marriage were not
what it seems.
First and foremost, this movie
is an adaptation of the play Lady
Windermere’s Fan by Oscar Wilde.
Therefore, it is not a surprise that the
plot was par excellence. With Oscar
Wilde, you realise that nothing is
ever a coincidence and that nothing
is ever what it seems. However, the
scriptwriters still have to be credited
for adapting the play into the movie
without destroying the play’s excel-
lent points. It is an achievement that
not many adaptations (ahem... such
as Harry Potter) can crow about.
The decision to have the story take
place in Italy instead of London is
also a welcome improvement to the
movie. It helps create a more pic-
turesque and surreal atmosphere
that makes the viewing experience
a more enjoyable one.
However, the actors’ performanc-
es still had room for improvement
even though experienced actress-
es were chosen for the lead roles.
Johansson is far from comfortable
in her role as the sweet and inno-
cent Lady Windermere. However, it
could be argued that her awkward-
ness is a method of demonstrating
Lady Windermere’s naivety.
Helen Hunt did not give a convinc-
ing portrait of a seductress, but sur-
prisingly, as the story progresses,
she does manage to become a bit-
terly misunderstood Mrs Erlynne.
Nevertheless, the most disappoint-
ing act in the whole movie was that
of Stephen Campbell Moore as Lord
Darlington. Not only did he lack the
looks expected of an international
playboy, he was simply not suave
enough to convince viewers that
he could steal Lady Windermere’s
heart. It is especially unbeliev-
able when Lord Windermere (Mark
Umbers) has wholesome American
good looks.
Overall, A Good Woman is a thor-
oughly engaging movie despite its
shortcomings. It is an enjoyable film
that helps the audience to learn
some life lessons as well. These life
lessons include the value of trust in
a loved one, the wisdom of not allow-
ing imperfections to affect one’s oth-
erwise perfect relationship, and the
value of pride over love. Therefore,
A Good Woman is a very much rec-
ommended watch, not just for Oscar
Wilde fans but for everyone who is
looking for a movie that has both
meaning and entertainment value in
today’s superficial film industry.
