Welcome back, coffee fans. After a very relaxing few weeks of exams,
Coffee Break is back to entertain you for the remainder of yours
We have a nice big prize budget which we’ll be spending on worthless junk for the top twenty FUCWIT teams, so if you’d like to win
something which, let’s face it, is always nice, there are still a few weeks left to enter. If you’re already in the FUCWIT League and
you’d like to win something a little better than the rubbish you’re in line for right now, there’s still time to earn some extra
points and get yourself a better prize too. Answers as always go to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk

Coffee Break
With David Hasselhoff
Hoff’s Long Weekend
“So once
again, Coffee
Break returns
for a few more
p o i n t l e s s
weeks of silly
little ‘puzzles’
and our own
brand of child-
ish ‘humour’.
Did you all have a good break? I
didn’t, but I don’t want to talk about
it.
OK, maybe I do. I spent most of my
holiday in the hospital with a bro-
ken jaw, three fractured ribs and a
severely bruised ego. All I was trying
to do was help a poor drowning girl
by giving her CPR, Hoff-style. Her
boyfriend wasn’t too pleased with
my first aid technique (tongues) and
decided to take on The Hoff. I tried
to explain it to him: ‘This is standard
Baywatch procedure, I’m the hero,
she’s the big-breasted tart who’s
been bitten by a shark/pirate/rebel
lifeguard, and you’re the dim-witted,
mildly retarded, redneck boyfriend.
You let me do my job, and I’ll let you
do whatever menial, life-sapping job
you do. If you have a job of course.
I can’t imagine Wall-Mart are that
desper–’
It was about then that he began
hitting me, and I don’t remember
much after that. I don’t remem-
ber much before or during either,
as I was steaming drunk after my
Champagne breakfast, Daiquiri
lunch, and Methylated dinner. I’d
asked that senile old queen KITT
to drive me to the beach for a little
‘Baywatching’ (advantages of hav-
ing a robot car) but as the redneck
began crushing my windpipe, I was
starting to think it was possibly a
bad idea, especially if the beach
is full of lantern-jawed idiots who
won’t let me help out their attractive
young girlfriends.
It was then that I made a vow: No
more Mr Nice Guy. That would be
the last nubile young lady I help out.
No more doing favours for the good
old US of A. From now on, I would
be a bastard.
So after a painful and booze-free
few weeks at the hospital, I was
ready for a long weekend of bastard-
ness. Needless to say, it didn’t go to
plan.”
Match The Hoff’s plan with the day
he did it, where he did it, and why it
went wrong. There’s 16 points for
this one, as we reckon it’s quite hard.
It probably isn’t. Use the grid and the
Hoff’s clues below to work out what’s
true and false. Tick something which
you know is true, and blank out some-
thing which you know is false, and
you’ll work it all out. Eventually.
“I had four dastardly plans:
A. Operation ‘The Boy Who Cried
Paedo’
B. Operation ‘Sign People Up For
LinuxSoc’
C. Operation ‘IVF / Abortion Clinic
Mix-Up’
D. Operation ‘Iraqi Freedom’
It was a long weekend (Friday to
Monday) and no, I didn’t do them in
that order.
They took place in Baghdad, Texas,
Miami and at Imperial and went
wrong for the same reasons that
anything goes wrong: No Booze, No
Women, No Money or No Plan.
Obviously, the LinuxSoc plan took
place at Imperial, where everybody
knows there aren’t any women.
Operation ‘Iraqi Freedom’ clearly
took place in Baghdad, and clearly
there wasn’t any plan.
I went to the US on a weekend, and
still had booze left on the Saturday.
In fact, I’m pretty sure I was in
Miami on Sunday.
The abortion clinic is run by a
religious lot, they’re always shut on
Sunday.
I should have known better after
the woman-free start on Friday.”
