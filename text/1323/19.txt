Imperial cueists take on the nation
BUSA Championship
By Amar Haria
Once again, the annual BUSA
snooker championship was
attended by an Imperial team
of exceptions to the norm
that practitioners of ‘stick
and ball’ must be corpulent
suffumigating thugs.
Put through the indignity
of pre-qualifying (appar-
ently something to do with
the vapid performances of
the last two years), Imperial
nonetheless sailed through
to the main tournament,
dispatching with aplomb a
motley assortment of minor
university teams (our hapless
victims were Birmingham,
Northumberland and some
chavs allegedly from Newham
College).
Then it was time for the
real thing. Waiting for us on
the first day were the win-
ners from the last two years,
Southampton and Glasgow.
We had Southampton at 4-4
(matches are best of ten, with
each of the five players com-
peting in two frames each),
at which point the valiant
captain ran up against Five
Flukes Man, who conjured a
victory with some unsport-
ingly adventitious play.
WeheldthemightyGlasgow
to a respectable draw, end-
ing the first day in moderate
spirits.
Saturday was the important
day of jostling and maraud-
ing for position in the group
table, and first up was the
Essex delegation, with whom
we drew 5-5. Next, and glori-
ous indeed, was a summary
8-2 demolition of a hapless
Nottingham team who did
quite well last year.
Buoyed with confidence and
momentum, we ran into York
who won 8-2. Nevertheless,
qualification to the quarter
finals was already assured,
in part because of our solid
performance and in part
through the generous system
whereby four of the six teams
in each group got through.
Waiting for us that evening
(it had been a long day) were
the bibulous Irishmen of
Queen’s, steeped in history
and tradition as a team of rare
quality. Some of that quality
was kindly meted out to us in
a 6-3 defeat. Of note, however
was a high break of 48 by
Imperial’s Jeremy Brackpool,
estimated by some observers
to have taken in excess of an
hour to compile.
Thus ended our campaign,
which was a more successful
one than in previous years.
We have yet to aspire to the
zenith of Imperial achieve-
ment in the early to mid nine-
ties, when we actually won
the thing, but visitors to the
top floor of the Union will
affirm that the typical con-
tents of the snooker room
have recently transanimated
from semi-pros and compe-
tent hustlers to vagrants,
hooligans and a sordid crowd
of fractured cues, which have
no place in the procurement
of champions!
In conclusion, we warmly
invite you to partake of the
game of stick ‘n ball in our
gentlemanly atmosphere,
and to subsequently reach a
standard of semi-pro in order
to wrench back from rival
universities the good name
of Imperial College (London),
and also to win the BUSA
championships again!
The team was: John Ryan
(captain, fusspot, and occa-
sional potter of silly balls),
Calvin Tsang (Prone to pithy
Anglicisms; he to whom
the soft shot is anathema),
Shawn Ow (always likely to
pot something, and mostly
with a loud noise), Jeremy
Brackpool (surprise claim-
ant of the high break, plays
snooker too), Lakir Kachhia
(demoniac at the table;
angelic at early breakfast)
and Amar Haria (president,
cheerleader, personal shop-
per and VIP).
SNOOKER
snooker too), Lakir Kachhia per and VIP).
Imperial’s snooker team reached the quarter-finals of this year’s BUSA Championship
