ALBUM REVIEWS
It would be a complete shock if this
album wasn’t brilliant. Maximo Park,
hailing from Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
are certainly a band on the up. Their
latest single, Apply Some Pressure,
made it into the top 20, and acco-
lades range from “the next Franz
Ferdinand” to “the Futureheads you
can shag”. The latter’s not a bad
comparison, but perhaps Maximo
Park possess more pop savvy than
the Sunderland lads, hopefully giv-
ing them a greater staying power.
A Certain Trigger is, simply put,
brilliant fun from the very beginning
to the end, packed full of short sharp
pop songs. Ignoring Acrobat, the
songs rarely graze three and a half
minutes and they’re proud to admit
they give their audiences just what
they want, ie tunes. This desire to
put on a show explains their incred-
ible stage presence and true musi-
cianship.
Though there is a reasonably rigid
framework to the structure of the
songs (um... except Acrobat), there
is still plenty of musical scope. You
wouldn’t expect anything else from a
band signed to the pioneering Warp
Records, normally home to brainy
IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) art-
ists. Graffiti begins with frantic
psychedelica and screaming organ,
whereas The Night I Lost My Head
is all stop-start rhythms and military
drumming. Limasol draws you in
with hypnotic synths before bursting
into driving new wave, contrasting
the sinister vibraphone and tom-tom
rolls of Once, A Glimpse, which also
features an intense chorus.
It’s amazing to think that sing-
er and co-lyricist Paul Smith was
the last addition to the band, as
he completely steals the show. He
snarls through some tracks such
as Postcard Of A Painting, exploit-
ing his heavy and rich accent in the
melodic Now I’m All Over The Shop.
There are brilliant lyrics through-
out (er... again forgetting Acrobat),
often scathingly mocking the sce-
nesters and trendies Smith finds
himself surrounded by. For example,
in opener Signal And Sign, he sings,
“I hope you’ve achieved it all with
your lies lies lies lies lies / How long
has it taken to look so fine fine fine
fine fine?” before imploring, “Don’t
waste your life, just go outside”.
The best track in my opinion is the
romantic and yearning The Coast Is
Always Changing, documenting the
excitements and perils of discover-
ing the world. “I am young and I am
lost / Every sentence has its cost,”
snarls Smith, before exclaiming,
“We look out across the sea / The
coast is always changing.”
This is a pretty faultless debut
other than Acrobat: beginning with
the horribly pretentious sound of
pages turning, Smith intones non-
sensical spoken word. Musically it
sounds like the Kevin Shields-heavy
soundtrack to Lost In Translation,
the kind of stuff shoe-gazers wet
themselves over. Only done badly. It
finally gives way to a stupidly wobbly
overwrought chorus: cringe-worthy.
But there’s no point boycotting an
album for just one track. A Certain
Trigger is great fun, clever and witty,
accessible and just quirky enough. It
should sell shed-loads, so get along
to a live show before they “do” that
Franz Ferdinand. James Millen
Twenty-two-year-old Martin Grech
is an extremely interesting charac-
ter. He was discovered at a young
age and allowed an amazing three
years to complete debut Open Heart
Zoo, released at age 20. He is a man
wracked with self-doubt; doubt of
his music, his voice, the world in
general. During the recording proc-
ess he became obsessed with the
idea that every experience in his life
could be split into three categories
– Holy, Sensual and Debauched –
and daubed these motifs across the
studio. Desperate to find a way of
expressing the troubled ideas in his
mind he began to pore over the dark
biomechanical art of HR Giger, and
the disturbing body-part photogra-
phy of Joel Peter Witkin. Needless
to say, Keane this ain’t.
The opener Guiltless sets the
mood for the entirety of the album.
Threatening distorted guitar and
bass sit low in the mix as Grech
chants about the human psyche,
punctuated with horror-film strings
and dramatic orchestral stabs.
Following this comes Venus, a
mainly acoustic track that allows
his rich voice to flow, before ending
with a haunting incantation. Spooky
vocals are evident throughout the
record, with snippets of laughter
and conversation flitting in and out,
and Grech’s unique voice switching
between chanting and truly amazing
falsetto.
The musical scope is intense
and the production team are to be
praised. Electronics, orchestration
and complex guitar are all executed
perfectly, switching from the warm
and uplifting Sun, to the mental I Am
Chromosome. The latter download-
only single can only be described
as a cross between the space age
sounds of Muse, the shronk rock of
NIN and the intense speed metal of
Metallica.
Although the album is far from
easy listening, I wouldn’t want you
to believe that it’s particularly hard-
going. Many of the tracks, such as
the melodic An End, are incredibly
warm and uplifting. The twin tracks
of Lint and Elixir are ghostly and
effervescent, shimmering lightly
across your senses and evoking an
extreme feeling of calm, before shift-
ing to euphoria as Elixir closes with
a spine-tingling end. It is a rapture
which is dearly welcomed, follow-
ing the terrifying Worldly Devine,
a track so insistently sinister and
threatening that it should come with
a health warning. Unholy pulls you
along like a film, completely full of
drama, intrigue and sorrow.
Amazingly, there is another gem
hidden away in the middle of the
album: the epic (almost ten minutes
long!) Holy Father Inferior. After
five minutes of dark choirs moaning
under his voice you sense a climax,
and when it comes it is all-consum-
ing with its brilliance, as Grech
screams unbelievably through the
upper registers accompanied by
what sounds like a whole army of
drummers. Mind-blowing.
Never have I come across an
album that provokes such emo-
tion before; it truly transports your
imagination to other (admittedly
dark) places. The album provides
a perfect dissection of what it is to
be human and there really is noth-
ing else that sounds quite like it.
Absolute genius. James Millen
Enter the current Queens website
and you’d be forgiven for thinking
you were experiencing a new media
version of some sort of The Ring
meets Blair Witch medley. Two
headed fairies smoking cigarettes
drift across the screen beckoning
“Click me”, before resting in the
twisted forests which occupy the
screen... a little scary but then that’s
never a bad thing is it?
Mark Lanegan provides the scene
setter with his eerie This Lullaby
like something an old music box in a
haunted attic might produce. From
here on in, Lullabies to Paralyze
provides 16 tracks which might
temptingly be called more of the
same – again not a bad thing, after
all, if it ain’t broke...
In My Head, most recently
famous for its Italian porn connec-
tion, sounds suspiciously restrained
until you realise you’ve been hum-
ming it all day. However this still
remains the most out of place track
on the album abandoning the echo-
ic, chanting, loaded vocals available
elsewhere. Someone’s in the Wolf is
menacing in its ascent and features
chilly, groaning little voices, the likes
of which might well be instructing
you to kill your elderly neighbour.
Ultimately each song conjures a
feeling. Tangled up in Plaid makes
you feel like you’ve done something
bad, and appropriately Long Slow
Goodbye makes you feel like you got
away with it. Revealing the darker
side of fairytales turns Lullabies
into more of a listening experi-
ence, something which is interest-
ing enough to make you want to
pay attention. What we have here
is essentially an extremely atmos-
pheric offering which manages all
the spookiness of Marilyn and his
counterparts with far more subtlety
and far less showing off.
