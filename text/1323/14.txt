LIVE REVIEWS
First up, brilliantly named The Chap,
coming on like a post-punk Help
She Can’t Swim, ie a bit shonky but
pretty cool all the same. Extreme
quirkiness and genre hopping is evi-
dent, from The Rapture style dance,
to dense “death metal” (their words
not mine, more Queens of the Stone
Age), to a song they call their “post
rock epic”, in which a thundering
bass drum accompanies them seri-
ously abusing a violin and a cello. If
only post rock were that fun. Good
effort, The Chap.
DANGER: EXTREME VITRIOL
IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!
Clor are the Do Me Bad Things of
MTV2-lite punk-funk, ie shit. They
look annoying (sunglasses indoors!),
sound annoying (front man sounds
like Brett “I’m not gay” Anderson),
have stupid annoying pixelated vide-
os playing behind them, stick annoy-
ing light-sabre things in front of the
stage, and do really annoying “rock”
intros and outros. Some tunes kinda
made you want to boogie, but they
always managed to turn them into a
pile of guff. The Queens of Noize like
them, which should pretty much be
‘nuff said. They do nothing that Le
Tigre, Suede and my Gameboy don’t
do 100 times better. Ignore any hype
you hear.
Therefore thank my good friend
Jesus Christ for tiny Tom Vek. A
bizarre hiccup in the world of sing-
er-songwriters, multi-instrumental-
ist Tom Vek makes really cool white-
man electro funk, beefed up with
some heavy beats and synths. And
it sounds amazing. He has also rus-
tled up a great band, even though
the guitarist looks like The Zipper,
acts like The Zipper, and has a fash-
ion-mullet. Fashion mullets are the
biggest crime to the music scene
since, well, The Zipper…and Clor.
They open on a storming C-C (You
Set The Fire In Me), with it’s jazzy
drums and break beat pauses, and
follow it up with a much beefed up
If You Want. The biggest surprise
comes from the otherwise mediocre
album tracks he plays. They are
transformed live into sexy, grind-
ing tunes. The audience was gyrat-
ing! The guitar break in If I Had
Changed My Mind has the crowd
go ecstatic, and previously lethar-
gic On The Road and That Can Be
Arranged are seriously and extrava-
gantly overhauled, with heavy guitar
and spacey atmospherics.
You do get the fear he’s going to
be a bit pretentious (he was labelled
“the saviour of Hoxton” at one
point), as many made-it-in-my-shed
artists are, but nothing could be
further from the truth. He dances
like a crazy robot, says “thank you
very much” after each song and
grins like a monkey. He did a bril-
liant little speech over his band at
one point, saying “imagine you’re at
a Prince concert, and that my gui-
tarist’s black, and that my drummer
is a woman and has a see-through
drum kit”.
There was also an incredible light
show. The centrepiece of a glaring
white neon We Have Sound (title
of his debut album) was flanked on
either side by mind boggling strips
of multicoloured LED’s. During
Nothing But Green Lights the band
were bathed in a traffic-light green,
and in Lower The Sun rich yellows,
reds and oranges lit up the stage.
Most of the time his band are in
shadow while Tom is spot lit - it is
his show after all!
Unsurprisingly he finishes (no
encore from this lad!) with anthem I
Ain’t Saying My Goodbyes. Frankly,
it was astonishing. Again you would
normally get clumsy moshing from
people to set closers, but the dance
floor was really gettin’ down! So
thank you Tom Vek for making me
forget about Clor, and also for mak-
ing girls dance again. Who knows
where this young musician could
end up? I urge you to find out,
because I can’t help feeling that it
could be one of those “I was there
first” moments. James Millen

ALBUM REVIEWS
Not being a child of the eighties,
New Order were always some-
thing of a boat that left me on the
island. Last Friday’s performance
of Jetstream (frankly a poor man’s
Vertigo) on Jonathan Ross did little
to change my mind, although in fair-
ness I can’t think of a single band
who has ever sounded their best on
his show. However, taking the time
to listen to the album I find myself
in the position of being something
of a convert.
Opening track Who’s Joe, with its
strange electronic galloping beat,
dramatic little tune and crispy
vocals, proves that New Order
may well have made a not alto-
gether crashing transition into the
new school of Keanes. In fact they
already seem to be making friends
in the playground with such coun-
terparts as Scissor Sisters and the
lovely Gwen Stefani. I Told You So
is a little too synthetic and Ace of
Base-esque for my palette, but such
crunchy effects find good homes
elsewhere in Dracula’s Castle and
the rather epic Guilt Is A Useless
Emotion. Ultimately, though, my
special favour is reserved for Turn.
Hidden near the end of the album it
is clearly heartfelt and to my mind
rather lovely.
The title track sums up this under-
stated album; it’s all about the tunes.
Well sung, neatly arranged, and nice-
ly appealing to the ear, Waiting For
The Sirens’ Call won’t win awards
for innovation, but its delicacy and
attention to detail make it a great
uplifting collection, perfect for the
end of term and a summer of doing
nothing. Alternatively, should you
prefer to fill your days, New Order
headline the Wireless Festival Hyde
Park on 24 June (tickets available
from the usual outlets), expect at
the very least an electric atmos-
phere. Giulia Clark
It’s hard to ignore the fact that
Northamptonshire new wavers The
Departure sound really eighties. I
mean they sound and look like a
cross between Duran Duran and
The Cure, plus they dance like Rick
Astley. It’s also hard to stop this
detracting from the quality of debut
album Dirty Words.
It’s an album you can dance to,
and the singles are indie floor-fillers
in much the same style as recent
Interpol releases, but with a flavour
of British eccentricity (the 80’s were
all about England). All Mapped Out
and Be My Enemy are fantastic, as
many a DJ has realised. But what
about the rest of the album?
From the very outset the album is
exceedingly cool. Opener Just Like
TV starts with spacey guitar effects
before launching into trademark
high hat and fast-track guitar lines.
It’s not lacking in tunes either, Only
Human has a gloriously melodic
chorus of “I am only human, why do
you look at me that way?” suggest-
ing someone has been a naughty
boy. In fact debauchery springs up
as a theme a good few times. In All
Mapped Out vocalist David Jones
declares “I see no future in this”,
and chants “this dance is just for
tonight” in his striking tenor voice.
This is surprising since he went
through, and advocates strongly, a
strict Christian upbringing, includ-
ing going to a convent school. Cold
showers for you, young man!
They do seem a bit formulaic in
places, with their distinctive bass
lines and guitar effects. Tracks such
as Arms Around Me and Time fade
away into nothingness for this very
reason. Luckily for every duff song
there’s a gloriously quirky and off-
beat Lump In My Throat, or a driv-
ing and funky Changing Pilots. The
album also ends on a high, with title
track Dirty Words. Featuring razor-
sharp twin guitar lines and a sweep-
ing chorus, it has rightly ascended
from b-side to set closer.
Dirty Words is certainly more
hit than miss, and has an enviable
amount of fantastic singles for a
debut. Steady touring and high pro-
file support slots (Hot Hot Heat, The
Killers) has built them up a solid fan
base ensuring The Departure are
five young lads to watch out for.

New Order and new nu-wavers
New Order’s new record is sonically conservative but still enjoyable, and the revival of new
wave continues with yet another ‘the’ band – they aren’t half bad, though
