The Alexander
Fleming Museum
After the Old Operating
Theatre, all we can say is
bring on the drugs. Fleming
discovered penicillin on the
site in 1928. His small lab
has been restored with origi-
nal books, medical equip-
ment and even a curator. The
Fleming has also entered
the merchandising racket,
so hurry before remaining
stocks of out-of-date memo-
rabilia commemorating the
75th anniversary of penicillin
(2003) run out. A must for
those who live on the wrong
side of the Edgware Road.
St Mary’s Hospital, Praed
Street, W2 (nearest tube:
Paddington). Open Mon-
Thurs 10am-1pm and by
appointment. Admission: £2
(adults), £1 (concs), IC
Medicine students free.

The Huntarian
Museum
This is the place for back-
street science museum
fashionistas to see and be
seen. The collection was
started in the 18th century
by renowned anatomist and
surgeon John Hunter, and
subsequently transferred
from his home (!) to the
Royal College of Surgeons.
If you’re into comparative
anatomy, complete skel-
etons, or just have a fetish
for bits of famous people in
lovely new glass cases, you
know the address. It’s all
class, boasting the Bishop
of Durham’s rectum and
Churchill’s false teeth.
35-43Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
WC2A (tube: Holborn).
Open Tues to Sat, 10am-
5pm. Admission free.
Grant Museum
of Zoology (and
Jeremy Bentham)
This little-known gem
focuses on the wonders
of the animal kingdom,
deceased. Started in the
1920s by Professor Robert
Grant, tutor of one Charlie
Darwin, highlights include
the plentiful specimens
in fluid. Animal lovers, be
warned, your goat may be got
by the rare and extinct crea-
tures, including the bones
of a dodo, on display. But
try and put it in historical
context... While inspecting
corpses at UCL, you could
call on the university’s ‘spir-
itual father’, utilitarian phi-
losopher Jeremy Bentham.
His preserved skeleton,
dressed in his own clothes
and with a wax head, stands
in wooden cabinet at the end
of the South Cloisters, main
building. Unlike the museum
specimens, Bentham wasn’t
bagged by a Victorian col-
lector. He asked to be pre-
served like this before his
death in 1850.
Biology dept, UCL, Gower
Street WC1 (nearest tube:
Goodge Street). Open Mon
and Fri 1-5pm, by appoint-
ment at other times.
Admission free.

Kirkaldy Testing
Museum
This is the old Testing and
Experimenting Works of
David Kirkaldy: a man with
a vision (and a motto) for the
role of testing in engineer-
ing. It is dedicated to materi-
als testing (stresses, strains,
tensions, compressions,
bendings and so forth) and
the history of the Kirkaldy
family. Built in 1874, it hous-
es Kirkaldy’s massive ‘All
Purpose Testing Machine’,
still in working order on the
ground floor. A gem of an
afternoon for anyone with
an interest in engineering
metrology!
99 Southwark Street, SE1
(nearest tube: Southwark)
Tel: 01322 332195. Opening
hours by appointment but
unarranged visits may be
accepted on the first Sunday
of every month (ring the
bell). Entry by donation.
The Old Operating
Theatre Museum
Squeamish? You will be. The
‘gore-ometer’ is in the red
and rising. Hidden in the roof
of an old church is a 300-
year-old herb garret, used
as a store for the St Thomas
Hospital apothecary until a
new operating theatre was
built in 1822. Now it’s the
oldest surviving in the coun-
try, lovingly restored so you
won’t miss a scalpel blade.
Marvel at instruments for
surgery, bleeding and child-
birth; see pathological speci-
mens; take in the aromas of a
fully labelled dried herb col-
lection; wince as you remem-
ber it was the days before
anaesthetic. Ouch!
9a St Thomas’s Street,
SE1 (nearest tube: London
Bridge) Open daily 10.30am-
5.00pm Admission: £4.75
(adults), £3.75 (concs).
Freud Museum
He spent a ridiculous
amount of time thinking
about sex, gave us the term
‘anally retentive’, and was
inordinately fond of his dog.
Sigmund Freud is still a cul-
tural icon. His work start-
ed the field of psychiatry,
informs parts of modern psy-
chology, and has left us all
withOedipuscomplexes.The
museum was the Freud fam-
ily home after he escaped the
Nazi annexation of Austria
in 1938. Its centrepiece is
Sigmund’s library and study
– complete with the origi-
nal psychoanalytic couch.
Don’t miss the well-stocked
gift shop, or your friends and
relatives will never forgive
you. Freud shot glasses, soft
toys, slippers and finger pup-
pets make presents no-one
dare refuse. Best buy has to
be the ruler – why not treat
your mother to a Freudian
twelve inches?
20 Maresfield Gardens,
NW3 (nearest tube: Finchley
Road) www.freud.org.uk.
Open Weds to Sun 12-5pm.
Admission: £5 (adults),
£2 (concs).
The Horniman
Museum
The Horniman is a museum
as delightful as its name is
suggestive. A top place to
bring a date, it’s an eclectic
mix – natural history, African
art,anaquariumandacollec-
tion of musical instruments
to rival Denmark Street. It’s
also gone to town on its taxi-
dermy. Guy or gal, date or
no date, check out the birds.
But the star turn has to be
one alarmingly overstuffed
bull walrus. Retrieved from
Hudson Bay in the late 1800s,
over-zealous taxidermists
just didn’t know when to stop
stuffing! For the less stuffy,
the Horniman boasts 21
acres of lusty looking park...
so perhaps you could sug-
gest some gentle ‘exercise’
in the grounds. Well worth a
trip to London’s deep south,
just don’t ask a cabbie to
take you there. And if you
ask for directions – watch
your pronunciation. “To the
Horni-man please!”
100 London Road, SE23
(Nearest station: Forest
Hill). www.horniman.ac.uk
Open daily 10.30am-5.30pm.
Gardens Mon to Sat 7.15am-
dusk. Admission free.
The Faraday
Museum
Michael Faraday is hailed
as the ‘Father of Electricity’
and since modern life,
therefore, depends on his
offspring, it’s probably time
you paid your respects.
Tucked away in the Royal
Institution’s basement, this
museum boasts yet another
fully reconstructed laborato-
ry. Here Faraday discovered
and described electricity
and electromagnetism, and
constructed the world’s first
electric motor and dynamo.
As well as being an all-round
bright spark, Faraday had
the ‘gift of the gab’ and could
explain his experiments to
almost anyone who cared
to listen. He established the
Royal Institution’s televised
Christmas lectures for chil-
dren... even before there was
television. Told you he was
bright.
21 Albemarle St, W1S
(nearest tube: Green Park)
Open Mon to Fri 9am-5pm.
Admission: £1.00 (adults),
£0.50 (concs).

birds is on offer. Photos courtesy of all museums.
