This week’s topic is the scar-
ily named diabolo. If you’re
on a shoestring budget (and
let’s face it, who isn’t at this
time in the year?) you can
assemble one from a pencil,
two plastic bowls, two sticks
and some string, but it’s prob-
ably easier and less painful to
buy one.
As a general rule, the
faster you spin it, the more
stable the diabolo becomes,
and the less likely it is to
fly off and hit something.
Years of experience have
revealed that a diabolo gravi-
tates primarily towards pints
of beer – consider yourself
warned.
At this point, some people
may be nodding smugly to
themselves and mumbling: “I
can do that!” Since this may
well be true, we have tried
to make things a bit more
impressive. While there are
many ways to make juggling
harder and consequently
more impressive, we’ll stick
to just one – having more
things in the air at once [see
picture 1].
To keep two diabolos on a
string is much harder than
just one diabolo. First of all,
they have a tendency to hit
each other with catastrophic
consequences and, as such,
you’ve got to figure out a way
to keep them apart.
First thing’s first: just start
one spinning. The easy way is
to give it a good run-up [see
picture 2] and just keep pull-
ing the string. Alternatively,
you can use Nez’s “superior”
method shown here [see pic-
ture 3]. Please carefully note
the superiority.
Now wrap the string around
the axle of another diabolo
and with rapid whipping
action (buy an ‘S&M Action
Man – with new kinky moves’
for more details on tech-
nique), start the diabolo spin-
ning [see picture 4].
Once it’s up to speed,
unwrap the string by mov-
ing the handstick. As the
top diabolo falls down the
string, toss the other one over
it [see picture 5]. Be patient
– if you toss it too early then
you’ll just end up in a horrible
mess as it will collide with
the other diabolo on the way
down.
Ifanyone’sstillfeelingsmug,
they can email juggling@ic.
ac.uk and show us how won-
derful they are every Tuesday
throughout term at the Union
from 6pm. Alternatively if
you’re amazed and want to
know more, email or turn up
and we’ll be slightly nicer
to you.

The Imperial College Chess
club ended the year with one
of the best performances
seen in recent years.
The Imperial team of eight
players competing in the
Middlesex League (Division
3) won all our matches and
gained automatic promo-
tion as outright winners of
the division, thanks to a bril-
liant team effort (key players:
Peter Levermore, Kanwal
Bhatia, Edward Leung,
Richard Thursby, Richard
Crampton, Malcolm Bovey
and Anup Sinha) under the
leadership of captain Slava
Burenkov.
Theclubalsoenteredateam
in the ULU Chess League,
captained by Beinan Liu
(key players: Felix Balthasar,
Robin Nandi, John Sargent,
Dave Man), which dominated
the league throughout the
season along with arch-rivals
UCL but narrowly missed out
on the top spot. However, on
the bright side, we did beat
our previous arch-rivals LSE
very convincingly. Their final
league position was third, a
long way from causing any
credible threat to the Imperial
team.
This year, there has also
been a significant increase in
the number of internal chess
tournaments and events.
Thanks to president Anup
Sinha for his hard work and
a great team effort by the
whole committee. Imperial
Chess has stepped into a new
era of glory!

It has been a fascinating two
terms for Qigong at Imperial,
and there appears to be more
ahead.
Qigong is an ancient
Chinese system of mind and
health regulation. ‘Qi’ is often
best translated as energy
and sometimes as informa-
tion. ‘Qigong’ is then ‘energy
work’.
In the traditional Chinese
model, our wellbeing is
dependent on the nature and
behaviour of the qi in the
body. In a healthy state one
has abundant qi, which is led
by the spirit in a harmonious
manner. Whilst modern sci-
ence would use a different
conceptual network, it too is
recognising the importance
of the complex interaction
between mind and body. At
Imperial there is a small
but growing group taking an
interest in this.
The autumn term saw a
one-month intensive course
given by an eminent visitor
from China, professor Yafei
Liu, Director of the China
National Qigong Training
Institute. She taught us
a Qigong system passed
down to her by her father
Dr Guizheng Liu. He is con-
sidered the father of modern
Qigong and is credited with
bringing many ancient prac-
tises under empirical scruti-
ny, naming them ‘Qigong’ and
applying them successfully in
China’s first Qigong hospital.
Yafei was invited here by
the London Academy of
Traditional Chinese Medicine
and Qigong and the Imperial
Chinese Wushu Society. It
seems all enjoyed her clear
method of teaching and
charming, positive approach.
During this visit we were
treated to a session by
Professor John Gruzelier,
principal investigator of psy-
chophysiology at Imperial,
on the mind-body connec-
tion in modern medicine.
He presented results from
various experiments in his
group linking performance
as well as health with the
mental state. They had used
a method called biofeedback
to improve performance of
Imperial dancers and Royal
College musicians. They also
noted that antibody levels of
Imperial students decreased
during exam periods, but
this effect was reversed for
each member of a trial group
practising positive visualisa-
tions from a Qi-based system
called Johrei.
We are now hoping to organ-
ise research specifically on
Qigong with Imperial. If you
are a medical student and
interested in doing a project,
please contact the author of
this article. Members of the
physics department interest-
ed in experiments for detect-
ing and quantifying qi, please
do the same.
We were also honoured to
have a very brief visit from
China by Dr Yang and col-
leagues. He is the inheritor
and grandmaster of Yang
Taijiquan, the most widely
practised Taiji-style in China.
There are currently Qigong
classes running every two
weeks at Imperial, taught
by Professor Zhao on behalf
of the Chinese National
Qigong Training Institute.
There will be several more
intensive courses given by
Qigong world authorities vis-
iting from China, beginning
with Professor Shengbing
Zhang, former director of
Qigong research at Nanjing
University of Chinese
Medicine, in mid-May. From
27 July, Professor Tianjin Liu,
director of Qigong research at
Beijing University of Chinese
Medicine, will teach for a
month.
All are welcome (large dis-
counts for staff and students).
