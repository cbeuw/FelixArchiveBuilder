Judge approves Babar
Ahmad extradition
By Dave Edwards
Imperial College’s central
library has become “an
embarrassment” and “a total
dump,” according to some
members of its staff.
In a letter to Felix, one
central library librarian, who
wished to remain anonymous,
launched a scathing attack
on College management for
“putting finances before edu-
cation”.
“It is apparently the aim
of IC to cram yet more
departmental libraries plus
their users into the central
library,” the letter continues.
The librarian goes on to ques-
tion how these libraries can
be transferred without losing
huge amounts of stock. He/
she also calls 24/7 opening “a
nightmare” that has “trans-
formed what usually looks
like a second rate polytechnic
library into a total dump”.
The mechanical engineer-
ing and chemistry depart-
ment libraries will be trans-
ferred to the central library
this summer, despite opposi-
tion from students.
Round-the-clock opening
hours during the summer
term were introduced last
year, with the strong backing
of Imperial College Union.
Sir Richard Sykes, the
Rector, told Felix that the
library is “not an embarrass-
ment, absolutely not. This is
the way forward, it has to be
24 hours a day, seven days a
week.”
He added that the College
needs to transfer “as many
of the departmental libraries
as possible” to the central
library, “because you can-
not work in a departmental
library 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week”.
Sam Rorke, Deputy
President (Education and
Welfare) of Imperial College
Union, told Felix: “24 hour
opening is very popular, but
the situation is getting unac-
ceptable as some students
are finding it difficult to study
there.
“If you were starting from
scratch, you wouldn’t create
departmental libraries. The
main issue is keeping a rea-
sonable provision of study
space in departments.”
Staff say central library is ‘an embarrassment’
By Dave Edwards
Editor
A judge has ruled that Babar
Ahmad, a former Imperial
College student and ICT
worker, should be extradit-
ed to face trial in the United
States.
Mr Ahmad, 31, from Tooting,
stands accused of running
websites to raise funds and
recruit new members for
terrorist organisations in
Chechnya and Afghanistan.
His extradition hearing
began in March, but two
lengthy adjournments were
made before the judge gave
his ruling on Tuesday morn-
ing. Once again, hundreds of
people, including a delegation
from Imperial College Union,
protested outside the court.
The verdict now requires
final approval from Charles
Clarke, the Home Secretary,
within 60 days. Mr Ahmad
and his supporters are likely
to appeal against the deci-
sion, in which case the matter
would be settled by the High
Court.
Senior district judge
Timothy Workman said that
the risk of the death penalty
was “negligible” and that
“none of the statutory bars”
prevented him from allowing
Mr Ahmad’s extradition. The
Imperial alumnus is set to
become the first British citi-
zen to be extradited under a
new law that does not require
US prosecutors to present
any evidence against him.
Imperial College Union
has been campaigning for
Mr Ahmad’s release since
December. Colin Smith, the
Welfare Campaigns Officer,
told Felix: “Obviously it’s a
sad day, but it’s not over and
we’re not going to give up.
The Home Secretary still has
to decide. The fight isn’t over
until the last protester lets go
of the wheel of the aeroplane
that takes Babar off to the
US.”
Mr Ahmad received 685
votes in this year’s general
election, standing as a candi-
date in Brent North from his
prison cell.

Chemists’
plagiarism
panic
All third year chemistry stu-
dents have been told that
every lab report they have
submitted this year will be
reviewed as staff begin a
thorough investigation into
cases of plagiarism.
The students were called
to a meeting on Tuesday
afternoon, where they were
told that they had until next
Friday to ‘confess’ to any
plagiarism they had commit-
ted. If they did so, their case
might be dealt with internally.
Otherwise, they could face a
University of London (UL)
tribunal. The most severe
penalty is disqualification
from all UL degrees.
“We have evidence that
there has been a signifi-
cant amount of plagiarism
in the third year,” Professor
Richard Templer, the Head
of Department, told Felix. He
added that as in any society,
“there are some people who
will cheat”.
One third year chemist
said: “They never really told
us what they meant at the
meeting, so that sent most of
us into panic.”
Another called it “a blatant
example of scaremongering
to get people to confess. I
think they know who’s done
it and they want them to own
up.”
A third student questioned
why the issue had been
raised now, during the busy
exam and viva period. Staff
explained that the plagiarism
had not become apparent
until recently, with a number
of cases arising since the end
of last term.
Professor Tom Welton, the
Director of Studies, told Felix
he had a strong suspicion that
at least two students were
guilty. He also reassured the
majority: “People who have
done nothing wrong have
absolutely nothing to worry
about at all.”
