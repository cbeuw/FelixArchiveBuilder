Phantom force haunts physics
A mysterious legacy of the Pioneer missions of the 1970s remains unresolved. Joao Medieros
looks at the anomaly that may threaten one of the most ancient laws of physics
Pioneer 10 and 11 were two
of NASA’s most successful
space missions of the 1970s.
Launched in 1972, Pioneer
10 was the first spacecraft to
travel through the Asteroid
belt and the first to obtain
close-up images of Jupiter.
Pioneer 11 was launched in
1974 and went on to make the
first direct observations of
Saturn in 1979. But there was
something else that made
them special: each carried a
golden plaque with a mes-
sage from mankind to alien
civilisations.
The plaques, for instance,
depict our solar system
and the path followed by
the spacecrafts (see image
below). The trajectory shows
their way past Jupiter and out
of the solar system. However
unrealistic the aim of contact-
ing aliens may be, there is no
doubt of the symbolism. The
Pioneers were the product of
a generation of astronomers
eager to communicate with
the cosmos. It now seems that
the cosmos has responded in
a surprising way.
In 1980, John Anderson, one
of the leaders of the Pioneer
team at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) in
California, noticed something
unexpected. Astronomers
should have been able to
exactly predict the trajectory
of their spacecrafts by using
the standard Newtonian-
Einsteinian laws of gravity.
But Anderson’s calculations
were all wrong. The space-
crafts were not where they
were supposed to be. It was
as if they were being slowed
down by an unknown, myste-
rious force.
Anderson was later joined in
his efforts by Michael Martin
Nieto, from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory and
Slava Turyshev, a colleague at
JPL. Turyshev was one of the
first Soviet scientists to work
in the United States after the
Cold War. When he first heard
of the Pioneer anomaly, he
volunteered to work on the
project for free.
Convinced that there was
an error in the way astrono-
mers were calculating the
trajectories, Turyshev studied
more than 60 possible effects
that could cause an abnormal
reaction in the spacecraft.
Every conceivable cause was
taken into account, from gas
leaks to the effect that ocean
waves, hitting the shores in
the Mojave Desert, had on
the radio instruments receiv-
ing Pioneer’s transmissions.
After more than a decade of
careful analysis, they realised
that these effects were not
even close to explaining the
Pioneer anomaly.
The mystery then got even
more interesting when simi-
lar effects were reported
on two other spacecrafts,
Ulysses and Galileo. How can
we explain the same anomaly
occurring simultaneously in
four different spacecrafts?
The scientific community was
now paying attention.
Today, an increasing
number of people believe that
the Pioneer anomaly could
actually be a discovery, a very
big one. The call for new laws
of gravity is getting stronger.
In fact, a solution may have
already been proposed a long
time ago. It dates back to 1983,
when Mordehai Milgrom, a
physicist at the Weizmann
Institute in Israel, first con-
sidered a modification to the
standard laws of gravity.
Back then, one of biggest
riddles in physics was relat-
ed to the motion of galax-
ies. Galaxies were observed
to be rotating in a way that
physicists could not under-
stand. Milgrom, using a dif-
ferent law of gravity, was able
to successfully predict such
behaviour.
Nonetheless, his attempt
was considered heresy
against one of the most well-
established physical theories.
The Universal Law of Gravity
was first formulated by Isaac
Newton and had managed
to describe how the planets
moved with one single equa-
tion. But in the 17th century,
Newton knew nothing about
galaxies. Stacy McGaugh,
a physics professor at the
University of Maryland, sug-
gests that Newton would
probably be the first to pro-
pose a different law if he knew
the facts about the galaxies
as well.
Milgrom’s theory on galax-
ies did not predict the Pioneer
anomaly, but an increasing
number of people feel that
it may well do so. There are
already several proposals
for more complete versions
of modified gravity in which
the anomaly is accounted for.
There is still a long way to
go, though, both in developing
the theory and getting atten-
tion. “I’m still shocked by how
so few of us have heard about
this theory, let alone know
anything serious about it,”
McGaugh tells us.
In the meantime, at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Turyshev and his colleagues
have initiated the develop-
ment of a dedicated mission
to study the Pioneer effect
and understand the source of
the anomaly. Whether it is a
gas leak or modified gravity,
Turyshev feels obligated to go
to the bottom of this. “What if
this is something that nature
is telling us?” he asks, “We
must be careful and patient
to listen and understand what
we are being told”.
Sadly, the main characters
of this story will not be around
for its conclusion. NASA has
received its last, very weak,
signal from Pioneer 10 in
2003, and Pioneer 11 sent its
last signal in 1995. The space-
crafts are probably plodding
their way into deep space, in a
way no-one yet understands.
“It was as if the
spacecrafts were being
slowed down by an
unknown, mysterious
force”

Is it you or I who should be in the asylum?
People with severe personality disorders, such as schizophrenia, are often perceived
to be a danger to the public. But most are a danger to no-one, and some abnormali-
ties in behaviour can lead to highly creative phases. So why do we lock them up?
