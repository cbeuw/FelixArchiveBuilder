Summer Ball Committee
Be prepared for Imperial
College’s most glamorous
event to date: the Hollywood
Summer Ball.
Close your eyes and imag-
ine you’re a Hollywood star.
The evening will begin by
walking up the red carpet
towards the lavish reception,
to be held in the Tanaka build-
ing. All guests will receive a
complimentary drink, wheth-
er dining or not, and will have
the experience of walking
amongst Hollywood stars
(lookalikes, of course).
Dining will be held at the
prestigious Queen’s Lawn
Marquee where a four-course
meal will be provided with
wine. The marquee will then
be transformed into a chic
jazz room where you can
relax and soak up the award-
winning atmosphere.
The Queen’s Lawn will have
a funfair and various other
entertainments, culminating
in a spectacular late night
fireworks display.
Prepare to be awed and
amazed, as the next part of
the evening continues inside
our Hollywood-esque venue.
Our esteemed guests include
Trevor Nelson of MTV Base,
who we are extremely privi-
leged to have at our event
considering this is the only
London date that he has
booked this year: very exclu-
sive!
Trevor will be playing in
the Great Hall, where he will
be whipping up the sensual
sounds of RnB and the bang-
ing beats of Hip Hop. The
popular Colin Murray, from
the BBC Radio One lunch-
time show, will be playing a
selection of funky tunes and
current and classic chart hits
in the Main Dining Hall. If
these splendid specimens
don’t tickle your fancy, there
will be a range of in-house
DJs to pump up the volume
and amuse you all night with
their block-rocking beats.
If dancing is not your forté,
don’t worry, we will be provid-
ing a casino and games room
in the JCR, and the popular
Bar Shisha will be available
in the Ante Room. There will
also be a photographer to cap-
ture the night’s magic in the
chill-out room (SCR). There’s
something for everyone!
Our sponsors Deloitte and
Creative have kindly donated
special giveaways, including
MP3 players and chocolates
galore. Also, cheap ‘take-
away’ food carts will provide
the peckish with burgers,
candyfloss, crepes and toffee
apples – yum!
For those of you who have
the stamina, there will be a
survivors’ photograph at sun-
rise (not included in the ticket
price) and breakfast (which is
included), a remarkable and
unique way to remember the
most fantastic night Imperial
College has ever seen.
For an outstanding night
to remember, get your tick-
ets from the Union office in
Beit Quad or the Union Shop
on the walkway. Watch this
space for special offers. The
ticket prices will be £45 for
entertainments and dinner,
and £25 for entertainments
– bargain!
The Hollywood Summer
Ball will be the perfect oppor-
tunity to celebrate the end
of the year and say goodbye
to your university friends in
style, whether it is just for the
summer or if you are gradu-
ating.
The ball will be an amazing
event, which has been made
possible by the increased
sponsorship funding that has
been received this year. It will
evidently be the best yet, so
don’t miss it for anything!
Lights, camera, action!
