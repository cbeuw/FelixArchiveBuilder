Much has happened since we last
met. So much so, that I’ll just give a
passing apologetic nod to those who
were offended by my unintention-
ally unfair castigation of the Arab
gentleman on the 211 bus the other
week and move on to bigger and
better things.
Such as my proposition from the
lovely Mr Geraldes. Diogo, I would
be delighted to take you up on your
offer on the proviso that we go out
for a coffee and get to know each
other’s likes and dislikes before
doing the vertical and possibly the
horizontal together. I’m sure you’d
hate to find yourself in a disastrous
situation where the action above the
waist ends up being infinitely supe-
rior to that below, hence testing an
admirer out on the dancefloor is the
only way forward!
Latino lovers aside, the love life
has been on the up. Not only was I
asked out by a Springbok chemical
engineering lecturer in Sainsbury’s
Local on Fulham Palace Road, but
I’ve also been ambushed by various
tramps whilst trying to further my
way towards academic success in
the library.
Stormy, in the library? I regret to
confirm this is so, since my laptop
exploded due to excessive ‘right-
click collecting’ of numerous per-
vables, the latest being the unadul-
terated testosterone of Rog from
Nowhere Near the Garden. Nick
from Rooster should really get over
himself – Rog doesn’t need to watch
Bon Jovi and Rolling Stones videos
to create a stage show worth its salt.
Besides Nick, Luke (an ex-LSE stu-
dent) is fitter than you anyway.
And what do I find in the library?
None other than all the stalkers I’d
rather not see. There’s Spotty, the
owner of an impressive hentai col-
lection; Greasy, also known as the
permanently stoned medic with the
fledgling metal band; and Oxbridge
Guy.
Oxbridge Guy creeps the entire
medical school out the most – his
pervy grin, thirties glasses, Peter
Stringfellow hair and surgically-
attached best mate with the pros-
thetic limb fetish and chauvinistic
views leave a lot to be desired.
Imagine my disgust when he decides
to announce his lust for Imperial
women to a computer room contain-
ing me and a group of second year
surfers. I narrowly escaped puking
over my keyboard when he fixed his
gaze at me, and I ended up setting
off the fire alarm whilst making a
swift getaway. Irresponsible, I real-
ise, but you’d do it too if an unwanted
admirer tried to use his Cambridge
cufflinks as a chat-up line.
It’s not just Charing Cross library
that attracts losers though. The sci-fi
and central libraries do too. Central
has it’s own ‘loin-man’, who walks
past ladies taking a respite from the
summer heat and, on making con-
versation, ends up asking whether
they would like to feel something
hot. When questioned further, he
reveals that his loins are the item
of relevance. Needless to say, he,
and the rest of civil engineering,
have managed to win themselves
the title of ‘Least Sexy Department’
in my books. Whilst being aestheti-
cally tolerable, their arrogance is
mind-numbing to say the least.
Sci-fi are, on the other hand, at
one with their shortcomings, and
try their best to over-compen-
sate for their ugliness by treating
their ladies like princesses. They
come perilously close to winning
the ‘Least Sexy Society’ prize, with
only Micro Club and the blue-haired
Mech Eng self-appreciation soci-
ety beating them to it! Arrogance is
unattractive, but vanity is seriously
flawed.
I digress. The point of this column
was to accentuate the positive, the
positives being that I have managed
to get a first on the presentation
with Birkenstock woman and that
the Jeff Hardy lookalike I almost
ran over on Chiswick High Road has
been keeping me happily occupied
on Sundays. Living anatomy is the
best lesson ever – and regular tuto-
rials keep me very happy...
The girl about town
by STORMY WOODS
Do you know that Akhenaton was
the first monotheist in history? And
that 22 kids have been executed in
USA since 1976?
OK! Now that I’ve written some-
thing smart and interesting, I can
proceed to my usual “taking the
piss” style without having any com-
plaints about how my articles are so
lame and uncultural.
This week’s column is about life in
halls. Or maybe that should be ‘life
in hall’, because I’ve only lived in one
(and I can’t mention it because that
would promote WILSON HOUSE
more than the others!)
Anyway, life in halls can be divided
in the following sections:
1. Parties
2. Studying (actually no... who am
I trying to convince that your first
year is dedicated to studying? Let’s
make it parties again and keep on
moving)
3. Hall events
4. Living away from home
5. Living in society
6. Reapps and wardens
1 and 2. Parties
From freshers’ nights out and birth-
day orgies, to halloween and ran-
dom-parties-without-any-special-
meaning, there’s a whole range of
opportunities for you to get wasted
and finally pull the ugly-girl-from-
the-floor-above-who-turns-you-on.
I’ve seen people arriving com-
pletely on fire and horny (rolling and
hugging on the floor is one exam-
ple), throwing up in a bin or in some
random guys room, on a free ambu-
lance ride or escorted by policemen,
carrying wooden tables or traffic
signs, spreading their dinner all over
the common rooms and buses... and
i could go on for a couple more lines,
but that would make you envious.
This is basically what life in halls
is about: party as if tomorrow is the
final judgement day!
3. Hall events
Hall events are great because they
give all the new students the oppor-
tunity to mingle together, promote
cultural, social, sporty and cheap
days around London and make you
forget everything about where you
came from.
There’s nothing better than waking
up at five in the morning and cross-
ing England by train to roll for the
whole day on mud and rocks, shoot
your mates and return straight to St
Mary’s Hospital with hypothermia
and bruises on parts of your body
you didn’t even know existed (that’s
paintballing, in case you are reading
this in your 24/7 study break in the
library)!
4. Living away from home
After the first month of events and
meeting new people, you finally dis-
cover that the smell in your room
doesn’t come from the corpse hid-
den under your mattress, but from
your pile of clothes. Now there’s no
mummy to help you!
You also realise that a balanced
diet definitely does not contain pizza
and shawarma and have to start
to learn how to cook, even if that
implies burning down the house,
getting stomach cancer or finding
someone to be your bitch and wait
for you to get back from college to
cook your stir fry.
There’s also the continuous fight
against the second law of thermody-
namics that makes your room look
like a battlefield where you can only
walk with food provisions for a week
and ammunition, just in case you
get lost.
Who said there’s nothing better
than living alone?
5. Living in society
This topic only applies to medics
and 3% of other students (the ones
who dont care about their degree
and who might be reading this mas-
terpiece of litherature). If you feel
that somehow you are not included
in this group, I’d like to introduce
you to a couple of key concepts: SO-
CI-E-TY and interacting with other
people!
Staying in your room, eating you
microwaveable rice or noodles while
ironing your underwear or program-
ing Sudoku in your calculator is not
sociable! (I find that the simple
appearance of Sudoku in my article
might raise the number of readers
by 50%, from 2 to 3. No, mum, you
dont count!)
6. Reapps and wardens
I was going to write a whole article
about this, but I think my opinion on
them (whether they are sporty, sick
mixers, nature loving, nightwalkers,
party people, drunk or married – and
im definitely not licking arses for my
next year as reapp) can be summed
up in three little words: WE LOVE
YOU!
So, life in halls can be amazing and
exciting for sure, if you put some
(little) effort into it. This year has
been a great experience for me and
I would like to thank everyone that
participates in it for making my life
without a beach, fit chicks, cheap
alcohol, sunny weather, my own car,
my best friends, my family and good
food much easier than I expected!
Analyse them
by DIOGO GERALDES
The question “why?” is just like
a balloon floating forever with no
destination or string to hold it with.
What I mean is that I don’t have a
clue why. I am humbled because I
don’t know, and I am empowered
because I can still ask. Really, what
is the point of either a music degree
or a mathematics degree, other than
to ultimately discover the right to
ask any question you want? Surely
education is about asking the ques-
tion and believing in the right to
do so, without needing a validation
through the promise of an answer.
I find it quite amazing, you know,
looking at a baby and realising she
has absolutely no idea. She doesn’t
know what to think, what to do or
who to be. Suddenly she pops into
existence and consciousness with
such a clean slate – only to face six
billion pre-existing ideas as to who
she already is. Then it is just a mat-
ter of fulfilling that role.
I know I am kind of ignoring the
genome here, but rightly so. You see,
worse than just that child drowning
in those six billion (and growing)
expectations and having her future
outweighed by too heavy a history,
the real tragedy lies in the child
being given the answers even before
she understands how to ask the
questions. Every generation lives in
the knowledge of undeniable truths
(the world was undoubtedly flat for
a very long time), which are only to
be disproved in the face of advance-
ment. There are so many things
we take for granted that will cause
silly brats of the future to sit in their
junior schools and giggle uncontrol-
lably at our stupidity!
In that sense, there is only one
thing we can be certain of, if we were
to learn a lesson from history: there
are a significant number of “truths”
that we take for granted and can’t
argue against now, that will eventu-
ally be discarded as myths at some
point in the future. So before you
know it, our little girl shuts up very
content to have found all the light
she needs and the world remains
a constant – lit by the past and all
those precious truths we must all
succumb to.
If only we had the profound means
of understanding through our lim-
ited minds, that in fact, all our life is
just a confinement of our unlimited
mind, then we could really appreci-
ate how frighteningly beautiful it is,
not to know. So, I proudly exclaim, I
have no idea!
Why?
