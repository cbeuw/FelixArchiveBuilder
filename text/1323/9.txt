Everyone needs a theory by which
to explain the world, to manage
relationships, to win friends and
influence people. Now a new philo-
sophical theory is emerging that
could revolutionise our perspective
on politics, law, and Union strategy.
This groundbreaking new outlook
touches on a largely unexplored
phenomenon: the tendency to bull-
shit.
“There are exquisitely sophisti-
cated craftsmen who – with the
help of advanced market research,
of public opinion polling, of psycho-
logical testing, and so forth – dedi-
cate themselves tirelessly to getting
every word and image they produce
exactly right. Yet there is something
more to be said about this. However
studiously and conscientiously the
bullshitter proceeds, it remains
true that he is also trying to get
away with something.”
Internationally renowned moral
philosopher Professor Harry G
Frankfurt has set out to broach this
difficult subject. First exploring the
concepts of bullshit and humbug,
he observes that they are not quite
the same as lying. In his thesis On
Bullshit, he concludes that exces-
sive indulgence can be an even
greater enemy to the truth than old-
fashioned deceit:
“It is impossible for someone to
lie unless he thinks he knows the
truth. Producing bullshit requires
no such conviction. [The bullshit-
ter] does not care whether things
he says describe reality correctly.
He just makes them up, to suit his
purpose.”
Although there’s something dark-
ly comic about his academic text,
regularly punctuated with the words
bullshit and excrement, this new
theory can provide a serious per-
spective on recent Union publica-
tions.
A glimpse at the impressive Union
Strategy brochure reveals some
characteristic qualities. Printed on
thick high-quality paper in an unu-
sual landscape format, the profes-
sional graphic design is something
you might only expect from a bur-
geoning investment bank, a modern
political party or a private arts col-
lege. But despite its incredibly glam-
orous presentation, the Union is still
fixated on its “brand and identity
issues”. Some recently published
objectives for the South Kensington
refurbishment reveal the severity of
the situation:
Objectives:
• Create a cohesion out of the
disparate functions of the Union
building
• Establish a new Union identity
• Unite the spaces together
through the design language of
the circulation and the spaces
themselves
• Wayfinding will be instinctive
through the new identity
• The functions will be
distinguished but part of the same
family
So, if you found the Union Strategy
impressive, you can only wait in
keen anticipation of the Union refur-
bishment. Once again, it appears
that some budding executives, mar-
keting managers and politicians
have united with postmodern artists
and unwittingly (or perhaps strate-
gically) disappeared up their own
brilliance.
If you are inspired to investigate
further then the elegantly printed
Strategy document is available from
your local Union office. It’s incred-
ible aesthetic qualities are evident
and the dedicated effort is over-
whelming. Hopefully there will soon
be a revised ‘Union Strategy Lite’
that serves the same purpose as
regular Strategy, requires only half
the usual rainforest, and doesn’t
take hours to decipher – to express
your interest please contact the
Union bureaucracy.
In the meantime, Professor
Frankfurt’s tiny publication On
Bullshit should be available from
most bookshops, but be prepared
for disappointment – it will be in
short supply after last week’s gen-
eral election.

Is it possible for girls to write
about guys without sounding like a
slut? Is it possible for guys to write
about girls without sounding des-
perate?
Let’s look at the evidence. The
enigmatic Stormy. Is she serious?
Does what she write have an ounce
of truth to it? We shall never know.
Does she sound like a slut? Well yes,
but to be fair, it’s pretty hard to write
about an interesting sex life and not
sound like a slut. In my opinion, not
quite as good as Ash last year, but
still, after Coffee Break, the Quick
Crossword, the front page and the
adverts, it’s the first thing I read in
Felix.
(By the way Stormy, dead baby
jokes are funny up until the moment
you, or someone you are close to,
loses a young child).
Then there’s Diogo’s ‘Analyse
Them’. Okay, so stereotyping is
fun. But self-deprecating the whole
university is going a bit far. There
are plenty of nice normal people
out there, and even the abnormal
ones are nice once you get to know
them. And contrary to popular
belief, there are loads of really nice
girls at Imperial, just waiting to be
asked out by a talented, interest-
ing Imperial student with massive
future earning potential.
‘The Neighbours Generation’.
Perhaps I’ve missed something,
but what does a ‘50% of kids in
university’ target have to do with
Neighbours? Rupert, I’m going to
make a suggestion that might help
you out, but I don’t want this to be
mistaken for an indication that I
like you. Stop watching TV. Go to the
Union. Buy a pretty girl a drink and
live happily ever after.
My favourite column so far has got
to be the refreshingly interesting
‘Who am I?’ by Suma Bhattacharya
[Felix 1321. The follow-up appears
this week]. To answer your ques-
tion, Wikipedia used to say, “the
key to confidence is knowing that
you are who you make yourself out
to be”. Whoever we are deep down
inside doesn’t really matter, since
nobody else gets to see that. People
see what we consciously or uncon-
sciously show them, and everyone
sees things differently, which is why
you’ve been accused of being “all
the pretty colours in the rainbow”.
So it would seem that the most
interesting columns have been when
people write about themselves.
However the most interesting
thing I did this week was to go
to a seminar on a compiler frame-
work for thread-level speculation.
And lose money at poker. And get
drunk at an empty Union on Friday.
Discovered for the first time that
I have a tankard in the Union Bar,
which I intend to make good use of
from now on. Discovered it leaks.
Talked to three nice girls, and one
not so nice girl.
Yeah, I think maybe I should
leave columns to other people. But
let’s make it interesting. Let’s hear
about Imperial life from people liv-
ing Imperial lives, not from people
watching Imperial lives. That’s you,
dear reader. Got a story to tell?
Let’s not turn Felix into a blog,
but let’s use this Columns section
for people to write about life at
Imperial. If enough people do it,
then maybe some of it will be good.
And if some of it is good, maybe it
will entertain us.
And remember, good writers bor-
row from others, great writers steal
outright.
You’ve got to be asking yourself
why I told you that...
Comment on columns

Why don’t British universities
have fraternities? Should we
have them?
Anyone who has ever watched an
American teen movie will be well
aware of the US phenomena that
are fraternities and sororities (the
female equivalent).
Curiously, considering that they
are labelled by Greek letters, frater-
nities have nothing whatsoever to do
with the academic legacy of ancient
Greece. In 1776 student John Heath
started a secret club in which he
and his friends could discuss the
pressing issues of the day, and he
named this club Phi Beta Kappa.
Fraternities mushroomed from
this. Now at least one fraternity is
present on most campuses.
Despite the fact that fraternities
aim to encourage intellectual and
social advancement, they are not
wholly welcomed by the US educa-
tional establishment, who believe
they could pose a threat to the power
of the university.
Fraternities create groups that
care for and feel responsible for
each other, in a manner that is close
to that of the familial love. This feel-
ing of familial love is surely a ben-
efit when many students are living
away from home for the first time.
But does it take a fraternity sys-
tem to make students care for one
another? Do we in the UK not care
for our fellow students if they are
not intimately linked to ourselves by
such a system?
As we all know, the social aspects
of life at Imperial are well below
par. If we had a fraternity-like sys-
tem, would Imperial be quite so
anti-social? I reckon it might help
oil the wheels a little, but the prob-
lems with Imperial are so deeply
ingrained it would barely scratch
the surface.
Fraternities may spew forth wor-
thy ideals on their aims being ‘to
increase academic achievement’,
but I seriously doubt that is why
the majority of students join. Frat
parties have to be the main draw.
How many movies have attempted
to show the sheer drunken debauch-
erousness of a frat party? Imperial
students’ house parties can be fun,
but they don’t come close to the
hedonism of fraternity parties.
This could be, and most likely
is, due to the fact that fraternities
greatly stack the odds on pulling
in the fraternity brothers’ favour.
I’m told that even the ugliest of frat
brothers can pull at a frat keg party.
But we all know the ratio at Impy
is ridiculous, and you couldn’t pos-
sibly attempt to create an even 50:50
atmosphere.
There is a dark side to fraterni-
ties – the intense rivalry that exists
between different frats has lead to
feuds reminiscent of gangland dis-
putes.
Frats are also notoriously elitist
and somewhat uninclusive, notably
preventing or intimidating gay stu-
dents and those of different racial
groups from joining. They were
founded on the basis of religion and
today remain largely religiously
secular.
In order to join a fraternity,
people have to show that they are
‘worthy’ of the privilege. Initiation
ceremonies and hazing (humilia-
tion) have been commonplace for
years. But recently the nature of
the tasks has changed from light-
hearted fun to the bizarre and life-
threatening.
What was once fun to watch, whilst
perhaps not so much fun to under-
take, has progressed into tasks so
humiliating that people have even
committed suicide. Six students
died last year as a direct result of
initiation ceremonies. Should young
men be putting themselves at risk
of death, just to give themselves a
sense of belonging in a daunting
environment?
Despite a university crackdown
on hazing, fraternities appear unde-
terred. Some are even considering
emulating the kind of naked humili-
ation shown to Iraqi prisoners in
Abu Ghraib.
The influence of fraternities is not
bound by the walls of the campus.
Fraternities’ power reaches into
the outside world. The British ‘old
boys’ network is, thankfully, less of
a back door entry into prestigious
jobs than it has been in the past.
Contrastingly, it is not unheard of
to see directors of major American
companies to be seen exchanging
secret handshakes.
According to Forbes magazine,
over a quarter of CEOs in America’s
top 500 companies were fraternity
members. This may sound like a
small proportion, but consider that
only 8.5% of university graduates
are members of a sorority or fra-
ternity. The influence of fraterni-
ties does not stop with big business
– 48% of US presidents and 40% of
the US Supreme Court justices were
members.
Have sleeves been banned in
Australia?
I’mwonderingwhetherAustraliahas
introduced a ban on guys under 25
from wearing T-shirts with sleeves.
If Neighbours is to be viewed as
a true representation of Australia
(which I believe it most definitely
is), then one must infer that such a
law has been passed.
