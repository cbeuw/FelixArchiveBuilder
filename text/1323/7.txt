Library crisis
Dear Dave,
YourreportoftheclosureoftheMech
Eng library (Felix, 5 May), worrying
as it is for hundreds of students
of that department, barely reveals
the tip of an iceberg which should
be a much greater worry for all IC
students. It is apparently the aim of
IC to cram yet more departmental
libraries plus their users into the
central library (chemistry is moving
this summer). Coincidentally, the
great and good within IC (led by the
College’s Estates Dept, itself heav-
ily influenced by the Rector) have
their eyes on Level 5 of the Central
Library, chiefly for admin purposes.
So how many quarts can you get into
a pint pot without withdrawing huge
amounts of stock (which is exactly
what is happening and is planned
to happen via much more off-site
storage at Wye) and by treating the
Science Museum Library in such
a cavalier fashion that it is likely
to be forced out altogether? Allied
to this is a report by IC’s head of
library services assessing the 10
years ahead. It assumes that elec-
tronic resources and services will be
invested in so heavily that current
stock (ie books and periodicals) will
be steadily reduced throughout that
period.
So who constitute this ‘Council of
professors’ [running the mechani-
cal engineering department]? How
many ever visit and use the central
library? If any did they would surely
have commented on the nightmare
that 24/7 opening has caused. This
policy has transformed what usually
looks like a second rate polytechnic
library into a total dump. Few IC
librarians are findable by students;
we’re all now stuck together in one
massive backroom office from which
few are allowed out. Students report
that much is not findable on shelves.
The library has become an embar-
rassment. So students should treat
statements implying that senior
decisions are made in their “best
interests” with the contempt they
deserve. IC has a very clear agen-
da, one which very definitely puts
finances before education. How stu-
dents react could well save or lose
library facilities for a generation.
From a central library librarian
Southside Bar
Dear Felix Ed,
One should never write in anger, or
so I have been told, so maybe this is
an ill-advised letter, but sometimes
you wait and wait and wait some
more and still the anger remains.
So you write a letter.
I could be angry because Southside
is about to close and will not be
replaced. I could be angry because
this decision was taken without any
consultation with the people pri-
marily concerned. I could be angry
because 35 people, most of them
students, and a lot of them in need
of the income in a time of top-up
fees, will lose an opportunity. I could
be angry because a place that has
won a dozen awards over the past
four years, which is packed full most
of the week and whose closure has
elicited quite an emotional response
has been described as part of the
“surcapacity in bars at Imperial”.
I could also be angry, to be honest,
for personal reasons: 8 years spent
at Imperial left me with quite a few
friends and good memories.
I could, and I was, angry for all
these reasons, but I discovered new
reserves of anger last week when,
in these pages, Southside Bar was
described as “white, British, mid-
dle class” [State of the Union, Felix
1322].
That was a remarkably cheap
shot. The truth is obviously differ-
ent: given the nature of Imperial’s
student population today, Southside
wouldn’t stand a chance of surviv-
ing, let alone turning a profit – which
it does – without appealing to the
whole of the student body... as Mr
Arif would have found out, had he
ever taken the time to come down to
Prince’s Gardens.
I am certainly not saying that we
are without faults and, yes, the place
can still appear intimidating to some
on a sport night, although we have
taken steps to curb this problem in
the last few years (notably the sing-
ing, just ask the members of the IC
football teams with whom my per-
sonal ratings must be this year at an
all-time low...) Nonetheless, I cannot
help but think that, if the Union
management had concerns with this
issue, they would have been better
advised to try and find a solution
with us instead of having us close
altogether (along with Linstead’s
and Weeks’ bars, even if they have
been barely mentioned so far).
Ultimately a bar is an empty shell,
we do what we can to make the place
a welcoming one but we can only
smile that much. What we do is try
and, if I can judge by the diversity of
our customers, succeed in catering
to (nearly) everyone whatever their
requirements, be it a full-length ses-
sion or just a couple of drinks. To
accuse us of covert racism is not
only cheap and craven, it also flies in
the face of all my experience; our TV
lounge is more packed, a lot more,
when India plays Pakistan than dur-
ing the Ashes!
This working class Frenchman
has been accused of a lot of things in
his time but being part of the white,
British, middle class establishment
is a novel experience.

Southside Bar
I’m constantly amazed by comments
Mr Arif makes about Southside
bar. Despite the so called ‘falling
demand’, Southside is popular with
students and staff alike, and has
won numerous awards, while the
Union bar doesn’t come anywhere
close.
If this is an attempt to increase
the number of people going to the
Union, then I believe it will end in
failure as I, for one, and most people
I know will simply choose not to go
drinking anywhere in college rather
than face the union.
I was very much looking for-
ward to a new temporary bar in
Linstead, and if the dining area is
to be removed to make space for a
shop and cafe, then the ‘communal
area’ which seems to worry Mr Arif
so much will dissapear anyway.
It seems that once again Mr Arif
has made a decision ‘in the interest
of students’ without actually con-
sulting any of them.
Sem
Nomination time
Dear Felix,
With the Union’s Colours coming
up, we felt the urge to nominate
an individual who we feel is cur-
rently doing a major service to the
Union and College in general; a sur-
prisingly large number of people
seem to think that his is a redundant
presence, bend on estranging stu-
dents and being the College admin-
istration’s errand boy; we will set
out however, hoping to prove these
Cassandras wrong.
What has that extraordinary indi-
vidual achieved so far? The list is
never-ending, but with the utmost
respect to your paper’s space, it will
be kept short.
1) Bullying over Choice: When
Greece won the European Cup last
summer, we were unsure whether
we were more jubilant about not
ever having to go to DaVinci’s again
(it being the “venue” where we
watched the majority of matches),
or about our victory per se. Let me
tell you, that place is GRIM. Being
RSM, it admittedly feels less uncom-
fortable in the Union Bar (what with
the Bottle and all); DaVinci’s how-
ever, and that dB’s place (with the
obscure events that seem to take
place there) are really a disgrace.
2) Illusions of grandeur and actual
power: “when I met College offi-
cials...”, “I could either choose...”, “I
had to choose the hall bar closure
option” ... it does get nauseating, so
we stop. The man seems to think
he is actually running the place!
We have never felt comfortable with
the primitive, semi-authoritarian
personality cults that have inun-
dated public life; when associated
with people who hold absolutely no
power whatsoever, it truly becomes
unbearable. Someone has to tell him
to just continue bowing his head
to whatever directives he receives
from College, or actually emerge
from his spineless state and stand
up for the issues that truly matter
to students.
3) Inclinations to political-cor-
rectness: the last thing you would
expect from a student member of
a research-led scientific institution
like the one we believe we are attend-
ing, would be for them to fall for the
cheap rhetoric of the PC crowd; and
not feeling guilty, as our candidate
does, when College-outsiders point
out the prevalence of white, middle-
class students in Southside... reviled
white, middle-class people, after all,
have much better ways of chan-
nelling their spending power than
being stuck in an underground hole,
haggling over a pint of Carling for
£1.53...
On top of the aforementioned con-
tributions, we are eagerly awaiting
our nominated individual’s efforts
to provide to “an ever changing stu-
dent demographic... a social space
that appeals to all”. The absurdity
of his own thought doesn’t seem to
trouble him, yet he goes on ranting
on the need to accommodate every
single need of a, largely imaginary,
cosmopolitan student body... Surely
it can only be a good thing that these
maximalist fantasies are the only
remotely political aspect of this per-
son’s meddling in our affairs.
Eagerly awaiting the due recogni-
tion our candidate for Union Colours
deserves.
Yours truly,
Ioannis Fourniadis

Sleepy security
Dear Mr Editor,
In response to your article about
security in the last issue of Felix:
This evening I went to the secu-
rity lodge in Beit at about 1am, for
whatever reason it doesn’t matter.
The guard was asleep, even to the
point where he had turned all the
lights off! I managed to wake him up,
finished my business there and went
to Sherfield to inform them of the
situation, and was basically pooh-
poohed and told to go away.
How, exactly, are we supposed to
believe that security are “there to
help us” when they are asleep, or
rude?

Analysing the analyst
Dear Editor,
After reading this week’s column
penned by Mr Geraldes [Anaylse
them, issue 1322], I became rather
perplexed as to the source of the
author’s knowledge on sports for
‘rich boys’. Mr Geraldes seemed to
be under the impression that the
favoured sports of those born with
a ‘golden’ (silver, surely...) spoon in
their mouths were rather obscure
and exclusive. This may well be true,
however, I wonder if Mr Geraldes
really considers ‘golf, fencing or
cricket’ to be good examples of such
sports.
In his definition Mr Geraldes sug-
gests that these are examples of
‘sports that no-one knows how to
play or that they even exist’. I sus-
pect the more likely case is that
these sports exemplify those to
which Mr Geraldes is ignorant of,
since a quick look at viewing figures
would demonstrate that several mil-
lion viewers tune in to watch Test
Match cricket or The Masters (that
is a golf tournament for the benefit
of Mr Geraldes).
I might suggest therefore that
Mr Geraldes borrows a copy of the
Penguin Guide to Sports for pri-
mary school children and looks up
the relevant sports. Perhaps a bet-
ter selection of sports might have
included ‘The Eton Wall Game’ or
possibly ‘Croquet’. Clearly though,
since Mr Geraldes was not born
with any cutlery in his mouth of any
description, these sports are likely
to be way outside his own sphere of
influence.
Regards,

Diogo Geraldes replies:
As anyone with two heart pulses
per minute and half a brain can
see, my articles are written in a
sarcastic way and are not to be
taken seriously.
I’ve realised that, for some peo-
ple in this college, a good sense of
humour is not a common charac-
teristic. They take life too seriously.
What is scary is that we are stu-
dents and need to relax and enjoy it
a bit before diving into the stressful
working world.
If you actually felt offended by
an opinion column (where I made
fun of almost every sport at IC
– even the ones I play), you are the
one who needs professional advice
and to learn about a thing called
IRONY.
PS By the way, just because a
sport is well known here in the UK,
that doesn’t actually make it easy
to understand for people that come
from other countries. After all, we
live in a multi-cultural society and
need to respect other people’s ways
of thinking and viewing the world.
I would also like to quote a para-
graph from my first Felix column:
“If you took this article too person-
ally, I would recommend you get
a life! (You can start by buying a
sense of humour!)”
‘4th floor library dude’
Dear Editor,
During the past few months details
have been revealed in the press of
lying and corruption in the intel-
ligence services leading up to the
war in Iraq. Judging by the fraudu-
lent coverage of activities on the
4th floor of the library, I’m surprised
Rupert Neate didn’t find any weap-
ons of mass destruction as well as
a ‘4th floor library dude’. I expect a
position in the MI5 is waiting for him
when he eventually graduates.
I do hope when he takes time off
from spying he has time to revise for
his exams so as to not be... a joke...?
The very best of luck in becoming
editor. Thankfully, I’ll be graduating
this summer so I won’t have to see
Felix in hot competition with the
Sun and the Mirror in the tabloid
stakes.
Ugochi Anomelechi
Rupert Neate replies:
Dear Ugochi Anomelechi,
I’m glad you’ve worked out it
was you I was talking about. The
very fact that you have managed to
identify yourself from my descrip-
tion shows that the description
was accurate. I hope that now you
have realised how annoying your
behaviour can be to the majority
of library users, you will curtail it.
Thanks for the vote of confidence
that you think Felix will by vying
with mass market tabloids.
