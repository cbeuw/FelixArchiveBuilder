Excellent.
Full stop.

t's a hard life b e i n g a fan o f guitar
m u s i c nowadays. W h e n y o u meet
p e o p l e a n d t h e talk turns t o music,
y o u realise that w h e n y o u say y o u like
to listen t o music that rocks with atti-
t u d e a n d guitars that resonate with
exhillaration, p e o p l e just think, ' O h
right, y o u m e a n , boring indie shite.' O n
dark a n d lonely nights in Linstead, I've
lain a w a k e a n d c o n t e m p l a t e d a c h a n g e
in m y music lifestyle -1 could listen to
d a n c e music instead. It's fresh. It's inno-
vative. It (sometimes) isn't repetitively
b o r i n g a n d uninspiring a n d if I listened
to it l o n g e n o u g h I might even find
myself actually d a n c i n g in t h e U n i o n
next t o t h e lovely w o m e n o f Imperial
instead o f w a n d e r i n g round a n d occas-
sionally spilling m y drink. Dance music.
It's t h e w a y forward. I'm g o n n a g o for it!
Yeah, right. A n d I guess t h e Pope
s m o k e s d o p e at Lent! Toasted is a col-
lection o f u n k n o w n artists f r o m Beat-
w a x telling t h e public that t h e guitar
s c e n e c a n b e inspiring a n d uplifing. It's
thirteen tracks of which ten or eleven are
really quite perfect p o p s o n g s - songs
a b o u t love, cigarettes, break-ups a n d
fuck-ups. Self-pity hasn't felt this g o o d in
ages. M y faith has b e e n restored.
It's a n absolute tragedy that I can't
m e n t i o n every single b a n d o n this c o m -
pilation. Multiscreen's Big City Loser c o n -
tinually threatens to burst into a great big
otgy o f distortion but pulls away from the
brink every time, resisting t h e urge a n d
h e i g h t e n i n g t h e t e n s i o n - brilliant.
Sketty's Call Me In short circuits a n d
breaks into an utterly unforgettable c h o -
rus - essential listening, f a n c e Riley's
Genevieve b o b s a l o n g with a jovial,
funky, druggy H a m m o n d riff-very cool.
Veer's Another Astronaut melds intelli-
gent guitar p o p sensibilities with rising
vocal deliveries - superb, f reeboy's Down
With You throws us a mix of Beach Boys'
harmonies a n d runalong rush-inducing
rhythms - excellent.
So get yourself a n indie pie before
s o m e fat bastard scoffs what's left. Get
it while it's got attitude. Get it while it's
hot. Get it while it's exciting. Get it before
y o u g e t fed up. G e t it w h i l e y o u c a n .
C o m e o n kids, treat y o u r s e l v e s . G e t

GOOBER PATROL
The Unbearable Lightness Of Being Drunk
T
hese guys are s i g n e d t o t h e Fat
Wreck label w h i c h m e a n s that
those w h o actually care a b o u t
west coast p u n k will already have a n
idea o f what this will b e like. Everyone
else probably won't have a clue a n d
probably w o n ' t b e that i n t e r e s t e d
either. A s is usual for virtually every
band o n Fat Wreck, G o o b e r Patrol have
taken m o r e than a slight influence f r o m
NOFX - w h i c h isn't that suprising c o n -
sidering that Fat M i k e both runs t h e
label a n d plays in NOFX. H e e v e n m a n -
ages to turn u p in t h e liner notes.
Anyway, o n to t h e a l b u m itself. As I
said, this is west coast punk. Forget about
G r e e n Day, Rancid a n d O f f s p r i n g - this
isn't o n e o f your over p o p p y attempts.
This is p u n k t h e w a y it's m e a n t t o b e
played, kind of. You see t h e a l b u m starts
off less than stupendously. The s o n g s
t h e m s e l v e s a r e g o o d . H o w e v e r , t h e
s p e e d o f t h e m u s i c at first is a t a d
a n n o n y i n g - t h e rhythm isn't right for
d a n c i n g nor is it fast e n o u g h for mosh-
ing. It m a n a g e s to fall b e t w e e n t h e t w o
with a disturbing t e n d e n c y for t h e first
half of t h e a l b u m . The main cause o f this
is b a d production. Punk is m e a n t to be
sloppily p r o d u c e d but w h e n t h e a l b u m
reaches t h e s o n g High Times, the bass
winds up in the right place in the mix and
y o u realise that this is what w a s w r o n g .
For the rest o f t h e a l b u m all is well - t h e
b a n d m a n a g e to alternate well b e t w e e n
fast a n d slower sections. However, t h e
first half of this a l b u m appears worse in
this light, a l t h o u g h this m a y well b e
solved in a live situation w h i c h is always
the best place to experience this style of
music.
The s o n g s themselves tend to have
a political slant most o f t h e t i m e .
A l t h o u g h t h e b a n d d o write a c o u p l e o f
s o n g s o n drinking: 1000th Beer and the
title track. T h e o d d thing about these
songs is that for o n c e a band has written
a b o u t alcohol a n d m a n a g e d t o appear
without strong views o n the to drink or
not to drink subject - quite a rarity really.
The last s o n g o n t h e a l b u m , / Forget
Your Name, is probably the strongest.
The b a n d get upset with 'trendy' bands,
w h i c h is slightly ironic considering that
they are a generic band o n a label that
caters for almost exclusively o n e s o u n d .
All in all this w o u l d be a g o o d a l b u m
if it wasn't for a d o d g y p r o d u c t i o n j o b .
The b a n d d o deserve congratulations

Singles
Muse - Muscle Museum EP
After a great introduction o f classical
guitars playing Godfather music, the dis-
tortion kicks in a n d a p r o t e g e o f Thorn
Yorke e n t e r s c r e a t i n g t h e s o u n d o f
R a d i o h e a d 5 years a g o . Still g o o d ,
t h o u g h .
Desert Eagle Discs - The Lovers
This is a hip-hop s o n g full o f the excit-
ing n e w s o u n d s c o m i n g f r o m this side
o f t h e Atlantic, T h e relaxed Bristolian
beats mix effortlessly with the yearning
plea o f "Why can't w e be lovers?' but the
inevitable rap finds Its w a y in, b e t w e e n
the c h o r u s e s .
Serum - Know How
This b a n d is basically a load o f annoying
A m e r i c a n college kids d o i n g their best
to rip-off G r e e n Day. You're left with the
f e e l i n g that this is w h a t H a n s o n will
s o u n d like w h e n that little d r u m m e r ' s
p l u m s d r o p .
FatBoy Slim - Praise You
Well, y o u probably k n o w this song, given
that it's b e e n at n u m b e r 1 recently. 'Bro-
ken r e c o r d ' is n o t a term that y o u ' d
w a n t a p p l i e d t o your s o n g , but Praise
You with Its repetitive s a m p l i n g o f the
*&£ \ ¥
end of the word 'should', sounds just
like one. O f course, those of you who
have been raving about FatBoy Slim this
past year will think It's a piece of Inspired
genius.
Little Mothers - Your Twisted Sister
Fusing the stoned trip-hop of Massive
Attack, the psychedelic drippy beats of
Primal Scream and some down-to-earth
vocals from the Jeff Buckley school of
singing. Little Mothers have both the tal-
ent a n d bandname to take them to
great things in 1999 H
