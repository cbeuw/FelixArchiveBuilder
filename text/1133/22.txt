Hia Bomb!
British R&B Bules OK!
What's U p People! A n o t h e t year has rolled o n by a n d
we're all left w o n d e r i n g w h e r e t h e hell it went, in fact
I'm still trying to figure out w h e r e t h e nineties went.
Everything is h a p p e n i n g s o fast, I'm s t o o d still w h i l e t h e
world w h i z z e s by all a r o u n d m e , or at least that's t h e
way it seems. Record c o m p a n i e s just a d d to m y c o n -
fusion with the n u m b e r o f records that are a p p e a r i n g ,
every w e e k there are m o r e releases. N o w don't get m e
w r o n g I love to s e e m o r e tunes but t h e p r o b l e m is
they're not all tunes, about a quarter are a waste o f vinyl.
The p r o b l e m s e e m s to stem f r o m t h e massive output
c o m i n g out of t h e States, not only is t h e R&B market
flooded with records but t h e quality just isn't there. To
m e m o r e important than just t h e sheer n u m b e r o f
releases is t h e fact that these releases are h o l d i n g
back British artists a n d g o o d quality tunes. M y case in
point is Another Level, a fantastic g r o u p that just could-
n't get a record deal over here, they w e r e passed over
again a n d again, they eventually got their deal from t h e
States. Surely t h o u g h s o m e o n e on, this side should have
picked t h e m up, but n o ! British R&B has not b e e n get-
ting nearly e n o u g h props a n d w e gotta correct that,
British R&B a n d hip-hop is o n a high a n d w e ' v e got to
keep it there. There is m o r e than e n o u g h talent out
there and it a m a z e s m e h o w p e o p l e refuse to acknowl-
e d g e it. G r o u p s like A n o t h e r f e v e l . D a m a g e , N i n e
Yards, Kle'shay a n d s o l o artists like Shola A m a , Kele Le
Roc a n d Lyden David Hall are representing British style
and w e gotta represent for t h e m a n d all t h e others try-
ing to m a k e it.
Q u i c k piece o f n e w s c o m i n g out o f t h e States, the
G r a m m y n o m i n a t i o n s w e r e a n n o u n c e d a n d Lauryn Hill
picked u p a record t e n n o m i n a t i o n s for her solo a l b u m
The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. T h e a l b u m w a s hailed
as o n e of the best hip-hop a l b u m s o f the year, if not
in t h e history o f hip h o p a n d n o w the establishment
have a c k n o w l e d g e d M s Hill.
Kle'shay are t h e latest all girl g r o u p to hit the
streets. I k n o w what you're thinking, there are already
way t o o m a n y all girl groups out there, most of them
are shit, so w h y d o w e need another one? Well w e don't
n e e d no more, at least no more Spice Girls or Bewitched
types w h o s e sheer existence I struggle to justify, all I
think is that there arc far too many stupid little shits with
m o n e y out there buying that crap. Kleshay are differ-
ent - they make qualily music. As I tried to point out ear-
lier Kleshay are a British group w h o make tunes that are
easily as g o o d as anything c o m i n g from the States. I heir
first single Reasons d r o p p e d in the a u t u m n ; it didn't
cause m u c h excitement even though it was a solid tune
s h o w i n g off the vocals o f t h e girls over a w i c k e d back
beat. N o w they're back with their s e c o n d single an u p -
t e m p o n u m b e r called Rush, this is a fine tune that
deserves to d o well - so represent a n d check it out. .
Timbaland is d o i n g it! This year has started off with
Timbaland bangin' out t w o A class tunes that quite sim-
ply d o it. first up there is the Destiny's Child tune Gel
On The Bus w h i c h started to surface at the e n d of the
year o n p r o m o copy. This is so g o o d that with most still
u n a b l e to get hold of it the Why Do Loots Fall In Love
soundtrack has been selling like hot-cakes just so peeps
can check this wicked tune. A b o u t t h e s a m e time Sony
released a lead u p single for the s e c o n d set from Gin-
uwine, the absolutely stomping What's So Different, Tim-
baland pulls out all t h e stops a n d g o d d a m n if this isn't
a tune that everyone needs to check a n d check fast
cause this is so hot its burning up.

TLc are back/
A l o n g time a g o in a recording studio far far away, a
g r o u p called l f C recorded their o n e a n d only hit in th
UK to date, Waterfalls. Then they disappeared off the
face o f t h e earth!
Well n o w TIC arc back, a n d have had a c o m p l e t e
image c h a n g e . . . g o n e arc t h e attitudes a n d the b a d girl

Alright, so they've c h a n g e d their image, so what? Well
they've also got a n e w a l b u m c o m i n g out in I ebruary,
a n d having heard t h e first l e w tracks, it is safe to say
the a l b u m is fucking superb. Ihe a l b u m is called f a n
Mail a n d the s p e c t r u m of tracks is large, there are
d r u m a n d bass tracks with hard hitting vocals, ballads,
t h u m p i n g bass lines a n d s o m e s u p e r b R&B tunes. IEC
have pulled out all the s l o p s o n this a l b u m , a n d this is
reflected by the; h u g e range of top producers w o r k i n g
o n the a l b u m , including Babyface a n d Jermaine Dupris
to n a m e a c o u p l e .
The a l b u m is out in I ebruary o n the 22nd in the UK

Wolverhampton
b o r n singer
Beverley Knight
h a d just started
college a n d never
s u n g o u t s i d e o f
church, w h i c h h a d
b e e n a vital train-
i n g g r o u n d a n d
an influence that
still remains with
her n o w . T w o
years later Bev
burst o n to t h e
s c e n e at t h e raw a g e
of 21 with her debut a l b u m , B-Tunk, c o n t a i n i n g hits
such as Flavour of the Old Skool a n d Movin on Up.
The success o f B-Funk s a w Bev receive her first award
from the Black M u s i c Awards for Britain's best Female
R&B act. Instead o f e x p l o d i n g a n d c o n t i n u i n g f r o m this
success, s h e w e n t u n d e r g r o u n d as s h e tried to extri-
cate herself f r o m D O M E , t h e label that l a u n c h e d her,
for EMI records. N o w , a g e d 24, Beverley is a little older
and wiser has m a d e it back after her recent success at
the M O B O ' s with her brilliant s o p h o m o r e Prodigal
Sista.
O n this entirely co-written a l b u m s h e has b e e n
reunited with producers 2B3 as well as collaborations
with t h e leading lights o f the UK R&B scene Carl M a c -
intosh, D o d g e a n d Don-E. The a l b u m kicks off with the
classic tune Made it Back featuring the r e n o w n e d US
hip-hop artist R e d m a n reflecting the difficulties of the
past f e w years. The rough a n d s m o o t h experiences of
the past is w h e r e Beverley draws most o f her lyrics. The
a l b u m includes the recent s u m m e r track Rewind, which
has the s a m e kind o f m e s s a g e as Made it Back and her
recent release Sista, Sista. There are also s o m e other
classic tracks such as the laid back AWOL a n d the
meaningful Strong Hand. The album finishes with a tune
The Need of You w h i c h has a blues feel a n d really
shows the raw talent Beverley has. You better recognise!
She has definitely lived u p to her first a l b u m s h o w -
ing s h e really has got what it takes to succeed. BK is def-
initely t h e most talented female UK R&B act n o w a n d
w a t c h for her live b a n d p e r f o r m a n c e s w h i c h are
absolutely m i n d b l o w i n g . BK is currently o n tour sup-
porting M o r c h e e b a . Forget all this US cheese music for
n o w a n d r e c o g n i s e t h e raw UK talent o f Beverley
Knight.
