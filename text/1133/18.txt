L
ove's Labours Lost is by n o m e a n s
the greatest o f Shakespeare's plays.
S o m e o f the characters are almost
dress rehearsals for future c o u p l e s in
his later works. T h e acting is certainly
g o o d . This is rather fortunate, as there is
very little else for t h e performance to rely
on. The set consists o f a f e w strategically
placed p i e c e s o f green-painted card-
board, a n d the costumes and lighting are
definitely minimalist. The cast is rather
small, a n d there are m o r e characters
than actors; if y o u c a n get over t h e fact
that s o m e o f t h e actors a p p e a r to be
schizophrenic (because they occasionally
c o m e o n in different c o s t u m e s with dif-
ferent accents), y o u s h o u l d be just fine.
The a c t i o n takes p l a c e in 1920s
B l o o m s b u r y society (a m o d e r n i s a t i o n
that works moderately well), with mis-
g u i d e d n o b l e m e n d e d i c a t e d to intellec-
tual pursuits abstaining f r o m w o m a n k i n d
only to have their plans t h w a r t e d by
resourceful females.
There are the usual benefits of fringe
theatre p r o d u c t i o n s situated a b o v e a
pub in that y o u c a n take your drinks into
the auditorium; only t h e very c r a m p e d
seating conditions m e a n that y o u will
probably e n d up sitting o n t o p o f your
n e i g h b o u r a n d spilling your glass (to
s o m e o f y o u , this m a y s o u n d like an
ideal night out!). M o s t c o m i c m o m e n t s
lie with t h e o b s c u r e Spaniard w h o w a n -
ders o n a n d off stage, a n d c a n d o a m a z -
ing things with his left eyebrow. This
spirited c o m e d y is worth a visit, but this
isn't g o i n g to c h a n g e your life.

T
he A l m e i d a Theatre C o m p a n y c o n -
tinues its exciting season with this
staging of Vassa by M a x i m Gorky, a
piece rarely seen in Britain. The play is set
in a provincial Russian t o w n h o u s e ,
o w n e d by a typical family b e l o n g i n g to
the n e w commercial class, w h e r e t h e
" h o u s e s are m a d e of stone - a n d t h e
p e o p l e o f iron". The central character o f
the story is Vassa, the mother o f t h e
family. She is the head of the household,
since her h u s b a n d is bed-ridden, a n d
runs their 30-year-old b u s i n e s s . S h e
orders everyone a r o u n d like a tyrant:
her t w o sons-are both afflicted by h a n d -
icaps. Pavel, the youngest is a cripple that
everyone, including his beautiful wife
Lyudmilla, m o c k s . S e m y o n , the eldest
can't express himself properly because
he is so scared o f his mother. His wife,
Natalya, is a brilliant creation - a w o m a n
w h o believes in her values so blindly
that it is funny. A f e w other characters
live in the house too - Vassa's brother-in-
law Prokhor, Lyudmilla's father a n d a
f e w servants w h o s p e n d all their time
eavesdropping.
T h e story b e g i n s to u n f o l d c o m -
pletely w h e n Vassa's d a u g h t e r A n n a
appears. She had been thrown out of the
house about 10 years before and, o n her
arrival, receives a very w a r m w e l c o m e .
Everyone starts d a n c i n g a r o u n d t h e
h o u s e . A n n a a n d Vassa d e c i d e to
b e c o m e allies a n d discover all t h e f a m -
ily's deepest secrets a n d plans. W e find
out that Prokhor wants to withdraw his
investment in the business a n d leave.
Every single p e r s o n in t h e family Is
u n h a p p y and Anna's presence serves as
a catalyst to t h e w h o l e situation. They all
feel e n c o u r a g e d to leave Vassa. The
father finally dies a n d t h e h o u s e h o l d
breaks d o w n w h e n they realise that
Vassa inherits all t h e business. Her sons'
d r e a m s o f g o i n g to M o s c o w with their
o w n m o n e y collapse.
The story is a fascinating attack o n
materialistic values and their influence o n
families. Gorky takes pleasure in show-
ing the worst in h u m a n beings. Vassa has
absolutely n o sympathy for her children.
She is a n e x t r e m e l y s t r o n g w o m a n ,
h e l p e d by her daughter. Vassa's tragedy
is that s h e is fighting for her family, but
at the s a m e time against them. Whatever
she does, s h e c o m e s across as a heart-
less matriarch w h o is obsessed only with
personal interests.
The play is very well staged with
only o n e d e c o r t h r o u g h o u t t h e three
acts, t h e actors are perfect. Sheila Han-
cock makes an intense Vassa, David Ten-
nant's Pavel is profoundly d e t e r m i n e d
a n d t h e others artists play their parts
splendidly. Vassa and A n n a create a w o n -
derful d u o , carrying most of the perfor-
m a n c e o n their s h o u l d e r s . H o w a r d
Davies d o e s a great j o b o f directing the
energy o f these t w o w o m e n . I his is the-
atre at its most entertaining.
