Bounty Killer
'It's a Party'
O h dear! If y o u like very, very, very s l o w
R&B. then this is a track for y o u . Pro-
duced by Wycliff Jean, it samples t h e line
"Ain't nobody, loves m e better...". The-
C D single c o m e s with 6 remixes w h i c h
all s o u n d the same. B e c o m i n g c o m -
mercial next m o n t h , it will probably b e
a big hit. but it's t o o slow by far.
Released 8/2/99
Blu Peter
'Blue Air'
D e e p a n d epic h o u s e track - a s u b l i m e
mixture o f t e c h n o a n d trance. It m a k e s
a refreshing c h a n g e to t h e nu-cnergy
stuff Blu Peter normally p r o d u c e s . This
is more o f a S a s h a / D i g w c e d track. It
comes with a couple o f mixes o n the 12"
which s o u n d pretty m u c h t h e s a m e but
are both g o o d .
The Songstress
'See Line W o m a n '
A rather classy interpretation o f N i n a
S i m o n e ' s "See Line W o m a n " w h i c h
c o m e s with s o m e superb mixes f r o m
Todd Edwards a n d Full Intention. It's
m o r e o f a chill out track than anything,
but well worth c h e c k i n g out, especially
if you liked t h e original version.
Vengaboys
'We Like to Party'
This track is not t o o disimilar from "Up
a n d D o w n " a n d will be just as big. It's a
bit faster than "Up a n d D o w n " with Wig-
field s o u n d i n g vocals - r e m e m b e r "Sat-
urday Night"?? It's a fast a n d f u n tune
with Ihe trademark fast euro house beat.
Watch out for t h e V e n g a b o y s in '99.

Bizarre Inc.
'Playing with Knives'
rail Paul d o e s the business o n this great
old favourite. Full of pianos, break-
d o w n s a n d "hands in the air" vocals, it's
a track d o i n g very well in the clubs at the
m o m e n t . C o m e s with plenty of remixes,
but w e like the Tall Paul mix the best.
H o u s e m u s i c at its best.
amestown feat. Jocelyn Brown
'I Believe'
Any track w h i c h has this diva o n vocals
is a must b u y a n d this track is n o excep-
tion A soulful, garage t u n c with plenty
of pianos a n d Brown's distinctive vocals
m a k e this a great tune. C o m e s with
loads o f remixes w h i c h give the track a
m o r e h o u s e / s p e e d garage s o u n d , but
the full-on club mix is the best. Excellent!

B.O.P. feat. The Soulystics
"After The Love Is G o n e "
(latt Boy Records)
Fatt Boy usually c o m e out with s o m e
u n d e r g r o u n d garage classics, but this
isn't o n e o f their better efforts. It just
doesn't stand out from the glut of garage
tunes that exist at the m o m e n t . C o m e o n
boys y o u can d o better than this.
Brasstooth feat. Pa-Melle
"Celebrate Life"
(Well Built)
With "Celebrate Life" w e have t h e exact
opposite. This is high quality garage -
g o o d e n o u g h to be caned at s o m e o f
London's premier u n d e r g r o u n d nights,
such as Twice as Nice, Cookies & C r e a m ,
a n d Pure Silk. All the mixes are bursting
with the s a m e quality. M o s t funky.

Brick Nation feat. Craig Travis
"I Like It"
(Velocity Recordings)
Average garage tune from Brick Nation
gets t h e remix treatment for t h e festive
season. The remixes are standard stuff
a n d don't really elevate this tune from its
non-descript b e g i n n i n g s . N o t brilliant,
but not awful either.

Marley Wills
"Rugged & Tuff"
( M e c c a Recordings)
Standard garage twiddling - nice vocals
but doesn't really g o a n y w h e r e special.
Apparently it's b e e n a big hit with lots o f
u n d e r g r o u n d garage DJs (so it can't be
all bad), but for m e it's a definite miss.
In fact, the B-side, " H o w Long" by Saman-
tha, shits all over t h e lead track.
