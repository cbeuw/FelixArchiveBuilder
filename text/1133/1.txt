St Mary's Lead Battle Against CJD
The CJD Research Centre at St Mary's
Hospital has d e v e l o p e d a n e w m e t h o d
of d i a g n o s i n g t h e n e w variant o f
Creutzfeldt Jakob's Disease. T h e
researchers, l e d by ICSM's Prof J o h n
Collinge, tested s a m p l e s f r o m tonsils o f
patients suffering f r o m s u s p e c t e d prion
diseases.
Prion diseases, s u c h as
CJD, are caused by a build u p
of an abnormal form o f a prion
protein in the brain, causing
severe neurological disorders,
a n d eventually death. Until
