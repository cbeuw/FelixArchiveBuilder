The Siege * * *
Starring : Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis, Tony Shalhoub
Director: Edward Zwick
25 January 1999
A
s far as H o l l y w o o d is c o n c e r n e d ,
action-thriller is u n d o u b t e d l y t h e
genre to b e in right n o w . Look at
the likes o f Enemy of the State - king o f
the high o c t a n e action m o v i e Jerry
Bruckheimer produces a film with plot
and substance. It's even got g o o d act-
ing. Similarly, Ronin a n d e v e n Star Trek:
Insurrection e s c h e w e d explosions a n d
bodycount in favour o f t e n s i o n , believ-
ability a n d plot. Sure, their w e r e s o m e
(excellent) set pieces, but these are dri-
ven more by t h e n e e d s o f t h e high-
tech, high-danger storyline than t h e
p r o d u c e r ' s d e m a n d that y o u b l o w
s o m e t h i n g u p every three minutes.
So it is with The Siege. It's got Bruce
Willis In it. It's got a hell o f a lot o f ter-
rorists in it. It's even got t h e U S A r m y
patrolling t h e streets o f Brooklyn. Yet
what Initially s o u n d s like a b l o o d coated
no-brainer quickly s h o w s itself t o be far
more politically aware, far m o r e tense
and far m o r e surprising than y o u might
at first imagine.
Washington is a n FBI a g e n t w h o , by
tracking d o w n o n e set o f arab terrorists
uncovers a massive w e b o f Islamic
extremists prepared to destroy N e w York.
That's two deep-pan perrerronl and mushroom. To go.
He takes assistance from a CIA s p o o k
(Bening) w h o h a p p e n s to cross his path,
but to n o avail, a n d s o o n t h e army is
called in t o d e f e n d t h e city - under t h e
leadership o f Willis. Suddenly the movie
shifts into gear, as t h e systematic back-
stabbing (which the movies w o u l d have
us believe is e n d e m i c in t h e US under-
cover security system) sets in. Willis clearly
doesn't trust Bening, thanks to her dubi-
ous role in t h e Gulf War. W a s h i n g t o n
doesn't trust Willis, believing that bring-
ing tanks o n t o t h e streets can only result
in violence. A n d Washington's long-suf-
fering partner (Shalhoub) doesn't trust
a n y o n e w h e n t h e army start setting u p
internment c a m p s . Basically, it's para-
n o i a city.
But if all that s o u n d s typically Holly-
w o o d - cheering o n A m e r i c a as it flattens
the rest of t h e world - then think again.
T h e senator w h o s u g g e s t s " b o m b i n g
the shit" o u t o f Libya, Iran or Iraq in retal-
iation is instantly s h o u t e d d o w n , a n d the
final half-hour resolutely sets out to prove
that terrorism is a state o f m i n d , not a
nationality. The only p r o b l e m Is that y o u
k n o w you've s e e n each scene d o n e bet-
ter s o m e w h e r e else. T h e surveillance i n
Enemy of the Stare was light years ahead,
the negotiation h u n g o n a sharper knife-
e d g e in The Negotiator, a n d t h e c a m e o
from Bill Clinton w a s far m o r e entertain-
ing in Contact
The real p r o b l e m with The Siege.
however, is that it's deeply seated in t h e
A m e r i c a n p s y c h e . In Europe, w h e r e
we're far more used to terrorist atrocities,
a n d didn't d e m a n d that t h e t r o o p s
m a r c h e d into L o n d o n w h e n t h e Canary
Wharf b o m b e x p l o d e d , it just s e e m s like
overkill. Q

Meet Joe Black * * * *
Starring : Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani
Director: Martin Brest
A
n early candidate for most biz-
zare plot c o n c e p t o f 1999, Meet
Joe Black is n o t h i n g if not origi-
nal. For starters, at $100 million its far
a n d away t h e most expensive r o m a n c e
ever filmed - with not an effect in sight.
Secondly, it stars Brad Pitt as Death.
O n e o f t h e world's most idolised m e n ,
playing the grim reaper. Interesting.
As ideas for a r o m a n c e g o , this is
pretty off t h e wall, with death d e c i d i n g
to c o m e to Earth, to find out w h a t b e i n g
h u m a n is all about. H e takes u p resi-
dence in A n t h o n y Hopkins palatial h o m e
(you can see w h e r e t h e b u d g e t went),
o n the understanding that h e w o n ' t kill
Hopkins whilst he learns about mortality.
What he doesn't realise, however, is
that t h e previous o w n e r o f t h e b o d y h e
has taken has met H o p k i n s ' daughter,
Forlani. That very m o r n i n g , they m e t in a
diner, a n d Forlani b e g a n t o fall in love
with the real Pitt. (Watch out for w h a t
h a p p e n s in t h e final s e c o n d s o f t h e
scene, as its worth t h e price o f admission
alone.) Suffice t o say, s h e is very con-
Death claearly knows all the best holldayspots.
fused w h e n Pitt turns up at her father's
h o u s e that evening...
Admittedly, o n paper this probably
s o u n d s like pretty cheesy, entirely pre-
dictable stuff. However, thanks to brilliant
performances from all three leads, what
results is u n a s h a m e d l y romantic. A d d to
that the fact that t h e e n d i n g is far f r o m
predictable, a n d the w h o l e thing looks
absolutely gorgeous, a n d you've got a
top film. Chick flick? Yeah - so what? Q
