Thief - The Dark Project (PC)
Eidos • • • • •
Like a thief in t h e night, y o u stole m y
heart. Well, if it wasn't bolted d o w n a n d
h o u s e d in a lead-lined b o x o u t s i d e
Euston station this g a m e w o u l d d o just
that. But e n o u g h o f m y personal life;
Thief : T h e Dark Project (to give it its
rather long a n d not all that helpful s u b -
title) is a c o m p l e t e steal o f a g a m e . K e e p
your mass m u r d e r i n g Q u a k e series, for-
get the subtle interaction of Half-life char-
acters just r e m e m b e r a b o v e all to k e e p
t o t h e s h a d o w s a n d a b o v e all k e e p
stealthy in this original first-person action-
adventure.
So h o w original is original? The main
character Garrett w a s o n c e a petty cut-
purse, w h o after d o i n g a bit o f training
with t h e local h o o d e d mystics w h o call
themselves t h e watchers (or s o m e t h i n g
equally mystic), has b e c o m e a master o f
evasion, w e a p o n s a n d has t h e unnerving
ability to nick anything not nailed d o w n .
Apart from t h e k l e p t o m a n i a e l e m e n t it
smells
awfully
like a
certain
Ninja
g a m e
called
T e n c h u
o n t h e
Playsta-
tion.
Smell,
yes,-
taste, n o .
Perhaps
there is a certain n e e d to use stealth a n d
intelligence. A g a m e w h e r e running in
with a pair o f size eleven pixie boots
gives the w r o n g impression but sneaking
up f r o m t h e s h a d o w s a n d s m a c k i n g
t h e m over t h e h e a d with a bit o f lead in
a leather b a g cuts o u t t h e n e e d for all
those nasty e m b a r a s s i n g first night c o n -
versations. But w h y
s h o u l d intelligent
g a m e play b e lim-
ited to a n y o n e
g a m e ? Anyway,
killing p e o p l e in this
g a m e is generally
f r o w n e d u p o n
(though take h e e d
of t h e generally bit).
Set in o n e o f
those thousands o f
alternate w o r l d s
w h e r e s w o r d s a n d
magic exist, t h o u g h
never in a state o f
perfect
harmony,
Garrett has
b e e n
e m p l o y e d
to d o a
f e w j o b s
for a mys-
terious
character
called C o n -
stantino.
These jobs
involve
g e t t i n g in
a n d out of buildings without attracting
t o o m u c h attention f r o m t h e g u a r d s
either p l o d d i n g t h e beat round town or
actually g u a r d i n g the house. T h e best
way to d o this is to hide f r o m t h e m .
Extinguishing candles a n d lamps with
your water arrows a n d y o u create your
o w n s h a d o w s to skulk in. Place m o s s o n
the floor to
d e a d e n your foot-
steps. If y o u really
have to take t h e m
out it is p o s s i b l e
a n d a g o o d deal
safer to d o it at
range. T h e b o w
b e c o m e s t h e
sniper w e a p o n o f
choice a n d a nice
clean arrow in t h e
n e c k will silence
the most annoying
of guards (if y o u
miss, t h e guard is
a bit miffed a n d attempts to s h o w y o u
the colour o f your s t o m a c h lining).
The levels a r c very large, a n d with
the d y n a m i c lighting effects a n d poly-
g o n s m a k i n g u p t h e surroundings they
are graphically impressive. G o o d as t h e
graphics are, it is t h e use o f s o u n d that
is really original. T h r o w a bottle onto the
floor a n d if t h e guard hears it, they will
investigate t h e b a n g s a n d clatters (an
Ideal opportunity to s e n d a guard the
w r o n g w a y for a f e w minutes). Voices
g r o w louder as they a p p r o a c h , a n d c a n
be used to time your attacks. For t h e first
time, it m a k e s m o r e sense to listen for
e n e m i e s rather than p o p round corners
to look for t h e m . Thief has m a n a g e d to
steal t h e title o f intelligent action a d v e n -
turer f r o m both t h e b u s o m e d Lara a n d
the fully kitted Ninja. Whether Metal Gear
Solid will just leapfrog t h e m all will b e a
c o m p e t i t i o n w o r t h w a t c h i n g .
