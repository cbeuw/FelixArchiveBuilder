Last autumn, a six-strong group of IC students headed for the mighty Himalayas, With a little help from sherpas, cooks and porters they succeeded in
trekking through the Rolwaling valley and climbing peaks in excess of six thousand meters. Jeremy Thomson reports on the success of the expedition.
It's half past five in the m o r n i n g , ten degrees below zero
and we're camped o n rubble at 5700 meters above sea
level. Y o u try getting o u t o f bed.
The thought o f all the effort we've p u t in so far, c o u -
pled with several cups o f w a r m tea, provide just enough

climbing, today w e hope to reach the s u m m i t of; t h f :
m o u n t a i n Parchamo. A t about 6 2 2 5 m or 20,800 feet it
is taller than M o n t Blanc and Ben Nevis c o m b i n e d a n d !
a greater altitude than any o f us have ventured t o
before.
As we prepare, nervous glances shoot back and forth
amongst us a n d the hill above, bathed i n watery d a w n
sunlight. Unlike A l p i n e climbing, we have neither reli-
able maps n o r guide books, n o r even an accurate value
for the mountain's height, so we're apprehensive about
what m a y lie ahead.
The climb starts by heading back to the pass w e
crossed the day before, w h i c h
at 5 7 0 0 m is one o f the high-
est regularly used i n Nepal,
and affords superlative views
of both the K h u m b u (Ever-
est) valley ahead o f us a n d
the R o l w a l i n g valley f r o m
where w e came.

expedition leader, Alan, leads u p the gentle snofv slopes
at a good steady pace. The tack of oxygen at this height
makes everything feel twice

The s u n has n o t y e t

cold, especially o n the feet.:
I'm climbing in leather boots

someone has left behind fixed ropes, w e reach a little
plateau and take a rest. Concerned about getting frost-

happy again (the toes, that is).
W e traverse a r o u n d into t h e

After negotiating a few steep sections

From Small Steps...
It all started more than a year ago, w h e n after a good
day's c l i m b i n g in Wales Alan turned
to m e a n d u n c e r e m o n i o u s l y said
"let's go o n an expedition". A t the
rime I wasn't keen, feeling the same
way about mountaineering as drunk
driving - great fun b u t unacccptably
dangerous.
By last C h r i s t m a s t h o u g h the
plans were starting to condense and
we had five people interested, all o f
us IC students. W e bought a m a p o f Nepal, fashioned
the 'trekking peaks' from bhi-tae and stiuk them on the
m a p , (Trekking peaks are a set o f
a p p a r e n t l y r a n d o m l y selected

able peak fees). O n e area stood o u t

Kwangde seen f r o m the Everest valley treated us
like roy-
alty until it became embarrassing.
As w e ascended the steep-sided Rolwaling valley
with its powerful river, the scenery began to change. W e
soon left the steamy sub-tropical jungles behind a n d
progressed through deciduous w o o d l a n d to scrubby
rhododendrons and juniper. Few tourists visit here, and
it is as authentic a sherpa settlement
a s y o u will find. The houses are small
and simple a n d the locals cultivate
potatoes a n d raise yaks. W h e n w e
reach the highest village, Na, we are
well above the tree line a n d the res-
idents have deserted for the winter.
F r o m this airy spot, w e
launched an excursion to climb two
peaks - Yalung Ri and the unfortu-
nately n a m e d R a m d u n g . W h i l e the
first w e n t well, o u r progress o n the
second was hampered by deep snow
and misleading maps, a n d it was
s u m m i t t e d o n l y o n the second
attempt by the expedition 'B-team'.
Buoyed u p b y o u r successful
attempts on o u r fust leal lumalavas
we started the gruelling trek to the l o p of the valley

enough to witness a dramatic avalanche |iist tar enough

the high Tesi Labsra pass w e were exhausted and c o n -
tused f r o m the altitude and sunlight, but had made it
over the notorious crossing w i t h o u t incident.
After the Parchamo climb, w e quickly d r o p p e d
d o w n into the K l u i m b u (Everest) valley which in c o n -
trast is teeming w i t h mostly American trekkcrs armed
w i t h flailing ski poles. The k l u i m b u has done well f r o m
mountaineering (Everest attempts pass through here)
and the houses are large and strong, tea houses, shops,
schools and even surgeries are plentiful on the well built
trail and it was with a slight sense o f
d i s a p p o i n t m e n t that we re-entered
civilisation w i t h its cafes, electric
lights and real toilets.
W e still had one more peak to
try, w h i c h lies high u p o n the west
of the trail in a. little-visited valley

After some debate, only t w o m e m -

ated several very steep ice steps, they were finally
thwarted by a huge crevasse just a hundred vertical

Reflections
Flying back to Kathmandu from a minute airstrip in
an aging Twin-Otter left us some spare time to reflect on
the trip. It's difficult to imagine a country less similar to
England than Nepal, socially, culturally and geographi-
cally W h i l e c l i m b i n g in the Himalayas was a wonderful
experience, it's the friendly, uncomplicated attitude a n d
infectious cheerfulness of the Nepalese that I'll r e m e m -
ber] The respect and tolerance generated by H i n d u and
Buddhist worship, the happy attitude of locals w h o
were poor but not worried about it and the truly different
art and culture of Nepal - these are what set the experi-
ence apart. W i l l I return to Nepal? You can be sure of it!
