Oxford Fees Mean Business
Oxford University is c o n s i d e r i n g setting
up a n e w undergraduat e course, with
fees that could a m o u n t to £15,000 every
year. This g o e s against t h e government's
decision that fees s h o u l d not b e larger
than t h e £1,000 most universities a r e
charging.
The course is a four year business
degree, d e s i g n e d by Oxford's m o d e r n
business s c h o o l , a n d is d i s c u s s e d in
detail in t h e 15 January issue o f The
Times Higher Education Supplement. I n
the article Professor Kay, director o f t h e
school, is q u o t e d as saying "We w o u l d
have to charge... t h e e c o n o m i c s just d o

not a d d up". Part o f t h e reason for t h e
extortionate fees is t h e prospect o f staff
at t h e n e w school b e i n g paid u p to twice
O x f o r d ' s s t a n d a r d salary o f £40,500.
N a t i o n a l U n i o n o f Students s o u r c e s

a p p o i n t e d . . . w e said that t h e £1,000

M e a n w h i l e t h e four r e m a i n i n g
Oxford students w h o have not paid their
£1,000 tuition f e e have h a d their uni-
versity library cards confiscated, accord-
ing to s o m e sources. It is unclear w h a t
will h a p p e n if the students refuse to pay,
with t h e University Registrar, David
H u l m e , b e i n g q u o t e d as saying "I will
h a n d l e that situation as a n d w h e n it
arises".
A march against tuition fees took
place last Friday (22 January) in O x f o r d
City Centre. A l t h o u g h details w e r e

In brief...
Consoc Sieged
A slightly unusual site w a s to b e seen by
the a u d i e n c e for t h e latest C o n s o c
event. John G u m m e r w a s harassed (for
cash) by medics in surgical g o w n s in aid
of Rag. John G u m m e r is t h e former sec-
retary o f state for t h e e n v i r o n m e n t a n d
is r e k n o w n e d for f e e d i n g his y o u n g
daughter a burger at t h e height o f the
beef scare. G u m m e r s e m p h a s i s e d the
harmonisation o f Europe's pollution lev-
els a n d h o w this might b e achieved. He
stated that pollution f r o m nearby c o u n -
tries had a greater effect than w a s per-
haps realised, a n d n o matter h o w much
w e cut pollution, w e are still bombarded
by those a b r o a d .
TUC Visits Labsoc
John M o n k s , the general secretary of the
TUC, paid LabSoc a visit last week. He
was k e e n to point out t h e n e e d for
U n i o n s despite a reduced manufactur-
ing base a n d d e m o g r a p h i c changes.
M r M o n k s a t t e m p t e d to m a k e clear
what a U n i o n stands for, emphasising it
is not merely to cause trouble with man-
a g e m e n t but is there to appeal to those
w h o are insecure a n d uncertain in the
workplace. H e states that h e is expect-
ing j o b losses later this year with the
implementation o f m i n i m u m wages and
fielded questions o n this matter.

Bike C o d i n g will take place in t h e Shcr-
field foyer b e t w e e n 1 0 a m a n d 4 p m
