IN FLAME
Bush Theatre
S
ituated a b o v e t h e Fringe & Firkin
pub, the Bush theatre provides a
cosy a n d casual e n v i r o n m e n t for
viewing innovative, c o n t e m p o r a r y pro-
ductions. Billed as " a play about a beauty,
a frump, a m a d mother, a d e a d girl, a n
idiot, a calamitous b o y a n d a h a n d s o m e
stranger" (quite a m o u t h f u l but e n o u g h
variety t o peak a n y o n e ' s curiosity), In
Flame by Charlotte J o n e s is fantastic.
After several drinks at t h e bar, t h e audi-
ence r e s p o n d e d spontaneously to t h e
witty script, sympathetic characters a n d
unpredictable twists o f t h e plot.
The play explores t h e relationship
b e t w e e n past a n d present, alternating
b e t w e e n m o d e r n day London a n d Edwar-
dian Yorkshire. The parallel story lines
linked by family ties, often involving t h e
s a m e actors, are skilfully a n d logically
intertwined, avoiding a n y risk o f c o n f u -
sion. As the play unfolds, the contrasting
parts - s o m e eccentric, others m u n d a n e ,
but all recognisably h u m a n - interact.
The result is an enchanting concoction o f
convincing drama, interspersed with g e n -
uine c o m i c m o m e n t s .
The simplistic, abstract set serves as
a neutral b a c k g r o u n d , s m o o t h i n g t h e
transition b e t w e e n scenes, separated in
time by ninety years.
Public sympathy wavers with each
thrilling revelation, b r i n g i n g p e r s o n a l
involvement l o a n e w d i m e n s i o n . The
captivating d e n o u e m e n t i n d u c e d gasps
of surprise from the audience, as the final
pieces o f t h e p u z z l e fell into place. In
Flame is elegantly crafted a n d flows at a
natural pace, maintaining your interest
until the very last breath.

Lyric Theatre Hammersmith
W
illiam G o l d i n g ' s N o b e l Prize-
w i n n i n g n o v e l p u b l i s h e d in
1954 is a m o d e r n classic, forget
for a m o m e n t that this b o o k is a famil-
iar favourite o f GCSE reading lists. This
scathing portrayal o f s o c i e t y is i n g e -
niously disguised as a fable. M a r o o n e d
on a deserted, exotic island after a plane
crash, a group o f s e e m i n g l y innocent
a n d d i s c i p l i n e d s c h o o l b o y s is trans-
f o r m e d into a tribe o f bloodthirsty a n d
murderous savages.
As y o u witness t h e horrific m e t a -
morphosis o f h u m a n nature, a feeling of
eerie discomfort a n d p r o f o u n d disgust
s w e e p s over y o u . T h e e x c i t e m e n t o f
escaping from t h e grasp o f authority dis-
integrates into b l o o d c u r d l i n g terror a n d
anarchy. Even during t h e interval, t h e
audience is haunted by the shrill b u z z i n g
of insects r e s o u n d i n g f r o m a l o u d -
speaker ( e n o u g h to put a n y o n e off their
ice-cream).
A handful of scantly clad adult actors
prancing around the stage playing snotty
children might s e e m ridiculous, yet t h e
performance is thoroughly c o n v i n c i n g ,
largely d u e to t h e cast's often exagger-
ated interpretation o f boyish manner-
isms, facial expressions a n d postures.
The c o n c e p t o f masculinity is
d e g r a d e d by t h e o v e r w h e l m i n g obses-
sion with h u n t i n g , fuelled by illusory
nightmares, w h i c h gradually replaces
their survival instinct a n d expectation of
rescue. The leading characters spring to
life - Ralph, t h e well-meaning leader.
Piggy, the vulnerable victim o f merciless
teasing a n d M e r r i d e w , t h e threatning
tormentor. The brutal destruction o f t h e
metaphoric m i c r o c o s m is s h o c k i n g a n d
thought-provoking. The energetic pro-
duction is extremely powerful, basically
spelling d o o m a n d g l o o m for m a n k i n d .
