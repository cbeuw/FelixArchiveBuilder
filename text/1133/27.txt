HOCKEY/GTK lose out to Imperial
IC I 3 -2 GTKI
The only t e a m t o beat us this year,
revenge w a s e x p e c t e d - a n d revenge
w e got.
Eventually. Things didn't g o to plan
as w e went 2-0 d o w n a n d a severe bash-
ing w a s o n t h e cards. U p stepped Fluffy
producing o n e of the fiercest shots o f all
season, duly tipped in by S p a g bol.
2-1 at half time a n d a c o m e b a c k
looked imminent. A g a m e o f 2 halves,
w e actually kept u p t h e pressure a n d
b e c a m e t h e d o m i n a t i n g t e a m .
Several scary m o m e n t s in o u r goal-
mouth c a m e a n d w e n t but t h e eventual
score o f 3-2 w a s deserved.
IC Ladles 16-0 GTK Ladles I
The girls w e r e w a r m e d u p a n d raring to
g o in g o o d time. But w h e r e w a s our
opposition? W h e n they finally turned up,
the match that f o l l o w e d w a s n o t h i n g
short o f a stormer. Bagpuss a n d Kinky
Boots w e r e o n t o p form, a n d Purple
Helmet got her oar in as usual (I).
The opposition used every dirty trick
in t h e book, e v e n bringing in a a n older
m a l e substitute, w h o w a s ugly (w**ker).
But the girls w e r e in "fighting" form a n d
finally " w a l k e d away" with a 6-0 w i n ,
subject to a p p e a l .

LADIES HOCKEY
IC II 0 - 3 King's II
Having nearly missed t h e train b e c a u s e
U n d e r d o w n h a d forgotten her shorts,
w e arrived in t i m e to h a v e o u r first
proper pre-match warm-up o f t h e sea-
son. Impressive or what? With o u r n e w
shirts as well, w e l o o k e d d a m n fine a n d
played brilliantly. During t h e first half
Chunderbird a n d Keyhole did a great job
of cheering us o n - so m u c h s o that w e
only c o n c e d e d t w o goals. T h e first o n e
w a s a really fluky deflection off t h e post
a n d t h e s e c o n d o n e w a s a lucky hit
through t h e goalie's legs. Apart f r o m
this Alice h a d a s t o r m i n g g a m e saving
s o m e really impressive shots o n goal.
O n e a w e s o m e save i n v o l v e d A l i c e
s c o o p i n g t h e ball o f f t h e g r o u n d a n d
over the backline. The u m p i r e wasn't
too impressed by this tactic, but it was-
n't until Alice actually g r a b b e d t h e ball
with her hands in another save that h e
awarded a penalty flick. Alice took it all
in her stride a n d her intimidating stance
caused t h e o p p o s i t i o n to miss by miles.
King's c a m e back strongly, a n d as they
a p p r o a c h e d o u r goal, o u r d e f e n c e
m o v e d aside like M o s e s parting the Red
Sea, giving the o p p o s i t i o n a clear sight
of goal. Fortunately, V a n n e s s a c a m e t o
the rescue at t h e last m i n u t e a n d saved
what w o u l d otherwise have b e e n a cer-
tain goal. W e c o u n t e r e d this with a n
a m a z i n g break, w h i c h w e very nearly
scored from.
In t h e 2 n d half w e started in h i g h
spirits a n d played e v e n better, putting
several passes together. W e m a d e sev-
eral more g o o d breaks with C h l o e play-
ing like a d e m o n . Kings got o n e m o r e
goal, but apart from this m i n o r lapse w e
w e r e fantastic. H a v i n g c o m e u p a
league this year w e are d o i n g really well
and at this rate m a y b e we'll e v e n w i n a
g a m e soon?

IC III 2 - 4 ICSM
W e d n e s d a y started with t h e s h a b b y
runts that call themselves ICSM m a n a g -
ing to turn u p o n time. With a mixture

straight o n t o the back foot. Voracious
winger Chris Bull a n d flexible Ree Haque
set u p a c o n t i n u o u s flow o f near misses
a n d really-should-have-beens. Stunned
by t h e ferocity o f this attack, ICSM
scarcely k n e w w h a t to d o with t h e ball
w h e n t h e m a n a g e d t o get it. Frequent
ICSM blunders a n d kak-handedness put
the ball firmly back in their D, a n d really
the q u e s t i o n s h o u l d b e a s k e d "What
are these guys d o i n g in the same league
as us?" With T o m m y Cantle c l e n c h i n g

Imperial's L o n d o n b a s e d 6th t e a m .
There w a s an air of a p p r e h e n s i o n a n d
yet joviality in the t e a m minibus, as Sil-
w o o d b e g a n t h e e x p e c t a n t j o u r n e y
towards H e a t h r o w . Irregular training
was all that the Silwoodians had in prepa-
ration as time is at a p r e m i u m at the
g r o u n d breaking research facility.
U p o n arrival at t h e Harlington sports
g r o u n d t h e m o r e y o u t h f u l IC t e a m
s e e m e d disconcerted with t h e prospect
of playing t h e m o r e mature m e m b e r s o f
Imperial College. As the whistle b l e w to
begin the g a m e , prc-match nerves w e r e
quickly quelled w h e n t h e first goal w e n t
in from Justin Travis for t h e Silwoodians.
This e n h a n c e d the close-knit t e a m spirit
w h i c h has b e e n t h e e s s e n c e o f t h e Sil-
w o o d t e a m , a n d it wasn't l o n g before
the s e c o n d glorious Silwood goal w e n t
in, scored by Konrad Dolphin.
At thirty-five minutes into the g a m e Sil-
w o o d h a d s c o r e d 4, 2 m o r e c o m i n g
from Milton M e n d o n c a a n d again from

H o w a r d Wilson m a n a g e d to score a fifth

b e f o r e a n o t h e r goal w a s s c o r e d , this
time by t h e h o m e t e a m , pulling t h e
score back to 2 - S. The Silwood team
hadn't finished at t h e g o a l m o u t h h o w -
ever, a n d Milton scored another to bring
the score line to 2 - 6. The only h o p e for
the South Ken t e a m at this stage, w a s to

c o u l d n ' t break t h r o u g h t h e cast iron
defence maintained by the t w o fullbacks,
Richie H e t h e r i n g t o n a n d Neil Holmes.
Later in the s e c o n d half Steve Edgington
scoted a blistering goal, w h i c h flew past
the keeper, a n d T h o m a s P o p e h o p e d to
