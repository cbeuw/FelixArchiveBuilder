Stop Right There and Read This
Put d o w n that pen/pint/reefer, stop flick-
ing through these pages without reading
them, and pay attention. It's time y o u got
involved with your Union. Mark Home's let-
ter o n page 6 outlines t w o ways y o u c a n
influence what happens at this university.
Read it. Elections are approaching, a n d all
the sabbaticals are h o p i n g that s o m e o f
you will consider standing. If y o u can't be
bothered to take u p Mark H o m e ' s offer
and don't want to be a Sabb, then at least
vote. The letter from t h e RCSU d e m o n -

Even if y o u don't have a social life a n d
are here just to get a degtee, r e m e m b e r
that sabbaticals are highly influential in
deciding which companies recruit from IC.
If you don't care about any of these things
then fine, don't participate - just don't
complain that things aren't the w a y you'd
like t h e m . For example, consider M r Rao's
letter o n Southside Shop's extortionate
prices - s o m e t h i n g I'm sure most of us
have e x p e r i e n c e d . If e n o u g h students
complained loudly, wrote letters, attended
meetings, then maybe w e could d o s o m e -

representatives, y o u have a vote - u s e

Apology to CX RAG 97-98
I w o u l d like to apologise for a slight inac-

w h i c h a p p e a r e d o n p a g e 1 o f Felix 1131.
In t h e s e n t e n c e w h i c h reads "...the
m o n e y raised by last year's Charing Cross
rag w a s credited to t h e reserve account,
rather than given to the charities c o n -
cerned...", C h a r i n g Cross s h o u l d have
b e e n replaced by St Mary's. The Charing
Cross rag w a s well organised a n d ran
s m o o t h l y in 97-98. Furthermore, all t h e
m o n e y w a s eventually given to all t h e
charities concerned from all the Rags. I'm
sorry this a p o l o g y didn't g o in last w e e k
