Gadget Watch - Gameboy Color (Nintendo)
The G a m e b o y has b e e n about forever- or
so it s e e m s . First there w a s t h e brick
shaped, battery hungry, f u z z y s c r e e n e d
Gameboy. The b a n c of family get togeth-
e r everywhere, w h e r e little ten year olds
w o u l d bleep a n d b e e p their w a y to a n
early bedtime. Then there w a s the pocket
gameboy. The n e w sleek, clear screened
toy for all those w h o h a d g r o w n u p with
the bricks, but h a d n o w all realised that
form w a s a b o v e f u n c t i o n . T h e s e little
pieces b e c a m e t h e professional nerd's
favourite travel c o m p a n i o n . T h e n c a m e
the multicoloured pocket versions, w h e r e
silver cases w e r e replaced with colours of
the rainbow as well as the o d d trans-
parent version.
But f o r all t h e s e i m p r o v e m e n t s -
weight, battery life, clearer screens - the
games themselves w e r e black a n d white
- surely not a worthy product to sell in the
next m i l l e n n i u m . N i n t e n d o t h o u g h h a d
a p r o b l e m . The p r o b l e m w a s in m a n y
ways a p r o b l e m o f its o w n success. S o
m a n y g a m e s (over 1000) h a d b e e n
brought out for the black a n d white sys-
t e m that if they d e s i g n e d a completely
n e w system they w o u l d have to d e v e l o p
a w h o l e n e w software library. S o Nin-
t e n d o instead have released the G a m e -
boy Color. Essentially it looks a n d
performs like a
g a m e b o y
p o c k e t after a
large d o s e o f
steroids (check
that battery
b u l g e at t h e
b a c k a n d dis-
agree). It plays
most o f the old
roms as well as
d o i n g a g o o d
colour job.
O n e o f the obvious improvements is
the n e w screen, m a d e by Sharp. G o n e
are those annoying contrast controls that
m e a n t that tilting the screen c h a n g e d it
f r o m nuclear blast bright to nuclear w i n -
ter black. The screen also displays t h e
colours perfectly sharply a n d believe it or
not the colours d o m a k e a difference.
The s o u n d doesn't s e e m to have b e e n
m e s s e d about with - t h o u g h m y version
s e e m e d t o b e set at a m u c h m o r e civi-
lized quiet v o l u m e w h e n c o m p a r e d t o
the old g a m c b o y pocket. The data link
has b e e n
s p e e d e d u p a n d
they have a d d e d
an infra-red data
c o n t t o l port s o
that y o u can play
linked g a m e s

L j l f r o m a techno-
M H f e . b o n d a g e party,
i I _ J _ j ( p r (but expect the
universal remote
control cartridge a n d car alarm d e c o d e r
stories to appear in the t e c h n o p h o b i c
parts of the press), finally there is a m o r e
powerful processor (so all o f the steroids
haven't g o n e straight to the screen or to
its rear), t h o u g h it is able to u s e a slow
m o d e to prevent the older g a m e s b e i n g
too fast.
N o honest - It looks g o o d In colour
So w o r t h buying? l o r the g a m c b o y
freaks a n d cultists a definate yes - t h o u g h
s o m e o f t h e s e guys probably o w n a
G a m c b o y light (even smaller than t h e
pocket). I or those w h o get bored o n
the l o n g j o u r n e y s , a n o t h e r y e s ( y o u
might e v e n get to w i n d u p the annoying
m o b i l e users), tor everyone else? Well as
g a d g e t s g o it is neat, b e l o w seventy
p o u n d s a n d will k e e p y o u o c c u p i e d
through the long dark hours. Its great for
i n s o m n i a c s as well as kids, (though the
insomniacs will n e e d a torch - the screen
isn't backlit) Gary S.

Codemasters - Micromachines 64 Turbo
The N i n t e n d o 64 is unfortunately d e a d
in the water. In the classic case o f t o o
little quality, a n d t o o late, C o d e m a s t e r s
have a n n o u n c e d that M i c r o m a c h i n e s
64 Turbo will finally m a k e it out in time
for the Faster holidays.
M i c r o m a c h i n e s , that rather classic
2D g a m e o n the o l d M e g a d r i v e , m a n -
a g e d to s p a w n a n incredibly playable
a n d enjoyable Playstation 3-D version
last year. The N64's 3D capabilities will
not have b e e n particularly stretched
but with u p to 8 p e o p l e able to play
expect it t o be another o f those Gold-
e n e y e style, gather round the IV,
everyone having f u n g a m e s (just pre-
vent those bad loser Capricorns from
taking it t o o seriously).
