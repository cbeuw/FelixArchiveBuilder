W e l c o m e to t h e n e w Felix c o o k i n g c o l u m n . M y
aim in these articles is t o s h o w that a n y o n e can knock
up great food, without it costing the earth or taking ages
to make. In my o p i n i o n y o u c a n get a long w a y simply
by having s o m e idea o f w h a t ingredients g o together,
and roughly what to d o with t h e m .
I'm not a big fan o f recipes. It s e e m s to m e that far
more is achieved by getting off the beaten track and tak-
ing a f e w risks. Recipes are a g o o d w a y o f learning n e w
techniques a n d g o o d c o m b i n a t i o n s o f ingredients, but
they can't list all t h e options. T h e important thing to
r e m e m b e r is that for most everyday c o o k i n g , recipes
should only be a guideline. Far t o o many things can vary
between your kitchen a n d that o f t h e recipe's creator
for the exact quantities o f ingredients to matter. Simi-
larly, the suggested Ingredients can often b e substituted
if y o u don't have t h e exact item m e n t i o n e d .
To start off with, here are a c o u p l e o f light dishes
both of which can be w h i p p e d u p in under half an hour.
They're both great for lunch, or as a starter.
Broccoli Pesto, Serves 2
W h e n y o u talk about pesto, most p e o p l e think o f
the green stuff in supermarket jars. While the classic basil
pesto is incredibly versatile, its only part o f t h e pesto
story. You can make a pesto out of pretty m u c h anything.
The only essential ingredients are olive oil, garlic, a n d
either cheese or nuts. This tecipe is o n e o f m y favorites.
Its just fantastic served with a h e a p o f fresh pasta.
1 m e d i u m h e a d o f broccoli, c h o p p e d
25g grated parmasan
2 cloves o f garlic
2 tablespoons o f olive oil
3 tablespoons of cream
juice of half a l e m o n
salt a n d pepper
The first stage is to c o o k t h e broccoli. Unfortunately
broccoli is a very submissive vegetable, w h e n simply
boiled a g o o d deal of t h e flavor is surrendered to the
water. The ideal solution is to steam it. If y o u must boil,
make sure the juices are saved for later. Either way, cook
until pretty m u c h all the bite is g o n e , about 10-15 min-
utes.

While the broccoli is c o o k i n g c h o p the garlic finely,
then fry very gently in the olive oil for a minute or two.
Be really careful not to let the garlic burn, frazzled gar-
lic must rank as o n e of the most unpleasant of tastes.
W h e n t h e broccoli is d o n e a d d it to the garlic, a n d
fry slowly for about 10 minutes, squashing any remain-
ing big lumps. By this point the mixture in the pan should
be really soft, a n d quite s m o o t h . Turn off the hob, then
mix in t h e cream, parmasan a n d l e m o n juice. Season
to taste (for m e , this m e a n s loads o f black pepper!).
Finally a d d a little water (from t h e p a n if y o u boiled the
broccoli) to take the mixture to t h e consistency of sin-
gle cream.
A d d t h e pesto to a p a n containing c o o k e d a n d
drained pasta, then stir well a n d serve.
L e e k a n d M a n a g e t o u t S o u p , Serves 4
Ihis soup is really w a r m i n g but has a fantasticly fresh
flavor. It almost feels like spring has c o m e early. M a n -
agetout are available cheaply at markets, but t h e recipe
is g o o d with dwarf beans too. Y o u really n e e d access
to o n e o f those h a n d blenders to m u s h the w h o l e
thing at the e n d . If that is a problem, just chop up every-
thing really finely.
2 m e d i u m leaks
200g o f m a n g e t o u t
30g ish of butter (preferably unsalted)
1.5 pints o f vegetable stock
1 tablespoon of plain flour
a couple of tablespoons o f d o u b l e cream
salt a n d pepper
l o p and tail the leaks and c h o p into fairly small slices.
Heat the butter in a fair sized sauce-pan a n d saute the
leaks gently for about 10 minutes until soft. M i x in the
flour a n d c o o k for another minute, then a d d the stock,
stirring all t h e time t o avoid l u m p s . I h r o w in t h e
mangetout a n d boil until they're ready to eat, about
another 15 minutes.
R e m o v e the pan f r o m t h e heat, then w h i z z it with
the hand blender. A d d t h e cream a n d season.
