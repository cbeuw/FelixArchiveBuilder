Get a Proposer and Twenty Seconders
Your proposer will introduce y o u in your
Hustings a n d s o m e t i m e s help run your
election c a m p a i g n . Having a proposer
w h o k n o w s a lot o f p e o p l e , or is
respected as s o m e o n e w h o is k n o w l -
edgeable about the w a y the U n i o n runs,
is therefore helpful. It doesn't matter
w h o t h e s e c o n d e r s a r c , as l o n g as
they're students, as n o o n e ever finds
out.
Write A Manifesto
This will be published in Felix a n d often
is t h e starting point of your questioning
in Hustings. In your manifesto you should
outline what your policies a n d plans are
for the next year. If you don't want to d o
this or have no policies then y o u can just
outline w h y y o u w o u l d be g o o d at the
job, a n d a n y U n i o n e x p e r i e n c e a n d
involvement you've had, however small
(no experience is not always a bad thing.)
Handle Hustings
You will be q u e s t i o n e d with t h e other
candidates about your suitability for t h e
job a n d other policies that y o u m a y not
have stated. It's worth d o i n g a bit o f
research so that y o u don't look like a
c o m p l e t e idiot. The best sources are talk-
ing to t h e present a n d previous sabbat-
icals, reading past issues o f felix (espe-
cially t h e n e w s a n d letters pages) a n d
reading previous ICU Council minutes.
This should give y o u s o m e idea o f w h a t
the current issues are, feelings o f s o m e
of t h e students towards t h e m a n d t h e
way in w h i c h the U n i o n works.
Run A Campaign
These tend to take the form of mass pos-
tering o f t h e campuses, varying f r o m
the funny to t h e 'these are m y policies'
to t h e 'look I'm sexy' type o f posters, all
finishing with a 'so vote for m e ' . There
have b e e n various other ways of seizing
votes used in t h e past. Flyers arc the
most obvious, a n d adverts in Felix, o n the
radio or t h e television station are c o m -
m o n . If y o u haven't m e t p e o p l e f r o m
other campuses yet get out to o n e of the
bars a n d meet t h e m ; bring a large wal-
let, there's nothing that a free drink can't
settle. Y o u c o u l d e v e n b e o u t r a g e o u s
and visit s o m e U n i o n meetings a n d look
k e e n .
Get People Out To Vote
This is the hardest part. N o matter h o w
well y o u ' v e d o n e so far, unless y o u can
get p e o p l e out o f b e d a n d to the ballot
box, there's n o point. To vote students
n e e d a n ICU card that can be o b t a i n e d
through the U n i o n Office. Taking t h e
two days of voting off to get your face
around is advisable. The g o l d e n n u m b e r
of votes to w i n s e e m s to be a r o u n d 700,
but this year w e ' r e h o p i n g for m o r e .
