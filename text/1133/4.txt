Bits & Pieces 25 January 1999
Words make prizes with Rough Guides
Been somewhere exotic? Excit-
ing? Have you got stories of
romance, intrigue, daring and
deceit? Or did you travel to see
what the world was "really like",
working and living with the locals?
Whatever your story, we want to
hear from you. Fe/wcis looking for
travel stories and features from
around the world - and thanks to
Rough Guide w e should be able
to offer a Guide to every one
whose work is published.
Rough Guides are the indis-
pensible guide books for every
traveller, covering the world from
Antigua to Zimbabwae, via Bul-
garia, Laos and Peru. As 1999 pro-
gresses, the Rough Guide list is
set to reach 107 travel titles, 22
phrasebooks, 15 music guides
and 5 specials. New titles include
Israel & the Palestinian Territories,
Guatemala, Syria and Vietnam.
Wherever you're planning on
going, it's almost certain that
there's a Rough Guide available.
Virtually all of this material will be
published not just in book form
but also on the website,
roughguides.com.
Here at Felixwe'ie looking for
interesting or informative pieces,
from 500 to 1000 words (prefer-
ably with some nice pictures, to
show us all how lucky you were to
be there). If you want an idea of
what we're talking about, then
just turn to page 14, where
there's an account of last year's IC
expedition to the Himalayas.
