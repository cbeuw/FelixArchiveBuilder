6 Letters 25 January 1999
Oi You! STOP! READ THIS!
Dear Felix,
Firstly, can I thank everyone that turned
up at Shaft o n the first w e e k of term - you
made the hassle of getting the n e w capac-
ity totally worth it, seeing 900 of you g o i n g
mental m a d e us realise that the effort had
been worth it.
But ICU isn't all about drinking and
dancing, so w e want to find out what you
all really think about your Union, and any
suggestions you might have to improve it.
To do this, we'll be d o i n g the following
things:
i) The introduction of c o m m e n t s a n d
suggestions leaflets.
You will find these in all the U n i o n
outlets, and they are there so you can have
a direct input o n any of our services - you
can tell us about anything that annoys you,
or any suggestions y o u might have to
improve things. All you have to d o is fill it
in and put it in one of the collection boxes.
The Union will try and respond to any prob-
lems within a w e e k and any suggestions
that get put into practice will be rewarded
with a E5 ICU voucher.
ii) The introduction of focus groups.
Basically, over the next w e e k many of
you will be chosen at random and sent let-
ters about h o w you can get involved in
groups that will discuss g o o d a n d bad
things about each of the following areas:
Union services, bars and catering, ents,
and Union Retail.
If you arc chosen we'd really like to
hear your views, and to encourage you,
we'll be offering free food a n d w i n e at the
groups. If you are not chosen at random,
but really want to get involved, then you can
e-mail m e o n m.horne@ic.ac.uk, and I can
send you details about the groups.
Remember ICU is here to improve the
quality of your life as students, a n d w e
can't do that unless you tell us what you
want, so get involved!
Cheers

ager)
RCSU Retaliates
Dear Felix,
Firstly as m e m b e r s and secondly as
officers of the RCSU, w e w o u l d like to reply
to the column in last week's issue by Simon
Baker.
In the RCSU Presidency elections, the
percentage of electorate that voted was
about 5%. In the ICU Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies) elections, last term,
approximately the same percentage of the
electorate recorded their votes, and in the
elections for ICU President Dave Hellard
about 9 % of the electorate voted. Even in
the elections for Felix Editor, only about 9 %
voted.
The question as to whether the CCU's
consider themselves in competition with
ICU is to be found in the amount of input
that the CCU's themselves have in the ICU.
The majority of Officers In the CCU's are also
members of the appropriate ICU commit-
tee and work together for the g o o d of the
students in general, not just those in their
o w n C C U . The current Welfare Officer, for
example, is also on the ICU welfare c o m -
mittee, and is not there merely to sit and
look pretty, but is also involved in repre-
senting the students. This can be seen by
the current Welfare Surgeries running in the
RCSU office on Mondays between 12.30
and 1.30pm.
M r Baker appears to be implying a
t h e m and us situation, which does not in
fact exist. We w o u l d say that in everything
the CCU's and ICU work together for the
g o o d of the students. However, the sug-
gestion that this is not the aim of all involved
shows that there is an underlying problem
of the view of the CCU's that the college stu-
dents are fed by such articles as those
found in Mr Baker's column.
Yours Sincerely, •
Simon Torn (RCSU President)
Joanna Churchill (RCSU Publicity Officer)
James Farrar (RCSU Publications Chair)
Southside Shop
Dear Felix,
As a not overly atypical first-year student
currently residing in halls in Prince's Gar-
dens, I find myself o n occasion discovering
that I have run out of milk or juice or what-
ever cssential-ish grocery item I've man-
aged to leave lying around or have, quite
simply, c o n s u m e d . So n o w w h e r e do I go
to replenish my stock? The nearest super-
market - Sainsbury's o n Cromwell Road is a
g o o d twenty-minute walk away. Hart's and
Lord's are closer but usually considerably
more expensive; aaaahhh, I hear you say,
there's always the Southside Shop, but this
place is extortionate, to say the very very
least.
To me at least, it seems patently absurd
that a shop run by a college, primarily for
the benefit of its students w h o almost by
definition are by and large in a state not far
removed from poverty, should be at all
"pricey". Apparently, "insistent" students
receive a 1 0 % discount, but the issue still
remains - the prices are still high - and a fur-
ther question crops up - why is it only "insis-
tent" students w h o are thus privileged?
Why not everybody else? It's about time
something was d o n e about this place -1
mean, is this college meant to be a mere
money-making machine, whose sole pur-
pose of existence is the churning out of
streams of. fresh, bright-faced graduates
clutching their degree certificates year after
year? Surely not! The College bears the
responsibility of providing us with services
it is reasonable to expect, and this is one
such service!
If it's not possible for the College to
reconsider its pricing scheme, I w o n d e r If
it would be possible for the Union to take
over the running of the shop. The Union
Shop and the Union Newsagents are far
better in this regard than the Southside
Shop is, and I do hope something can be
done to repair the sorry situation.
Yours sincerely,
Sunil Rao (1st year ISE)
Teaching Troubles
Dear Felix,
I write in response to the article
"Brightening Prospects" (Issue 1131) by
Claire Bayntun. This is just a (lot of) word(s)
of warning. In July 1994 I spent 4 w e e k s (of
a planned 8) with Teaching Abroad in
Moldova, a former Soviet republic. I was
working as an English language assistant for
Romianian university students w h o were on
a summer course. Which was fine. What
was not fine was the feeling that I had been
truly stitched up by a certain Dr Peter Slowe
(of Teaching Abroad fame). I shall detail his
crimes:-
a) The cost was £550. This was to cover
a return journey to Moldova, my food and
board, and one supposes the salaries of the
year-offites whose care and organistational
skills I entrusted.
b) £550 s o u n d s quite c h e a p for 8
weeks away you may say. True, but I was-
n't in N e w York, I was in Belsty. I calculated
that my return journey cost (at a maximum)
£100. W e went o n a bus you see. Even
though w e were told that a flight was in
order. A bus is fine. 24 hours on a bus is
fine. As is 48. As is 72. Well 72 isn't, but rel-
ative to 100 on one that only stops every 10
hours and doesn't have a toilet, and has 10
too many people o n it, it is (Ok that is).
c) He claimed that my 550 covered my
board etc. This was possibly his biggest
and most regretful lie. I stayed with a lovely
Moldovan family, for them it was honour
to have a westerner staying at there h o m e .
I was treated like royalty, with the best hos-
pitality they could offer. Had my £550 con-
tributed in any way to this? O h , no.
Everything I received was from the pocket
of a Mold ov an lorry driver. H o w guilty did
I feel? I left them 100 dollars saying it was
for my o n e 3 minute phonecall to the Uk.
Claire Bayntun is correct, w o r k i n g
abroad within an entirely n e w and fasci-
nating culture is worthwhile (and yes IC stu-
dents, I'm sure it earns your ever-so-valuable
CV points). But Dr Slowe is, from my expe-
rience, selling you a dream at a price. He
is making money from the kind of ideas that
M s Bayntuns' article espoused. If you want
to work abroad it is not necessary to pay
anyone anything to organise it for you,
sort something out yourself. I believe that
employers also value initiative.
Yours sincerely,
Nick Chatterton
Lay Off The Pills!
Dear Felix,
I'm writing for a bit of a m o a n at last
w e e k s "Agony or Ecstasy?" article. In no
way do I encourage the use of drugs or rec-
o m m e n d them, but if you are g o i n g to do
an article about ecstasy, then you might
consider getting s o m e b o d y w h o has had
experience with the drug to write the arti-
cle. Yes, taken in extreme quanities pills can
fuck you up, but this can also happent with
alcohol, d o p e or even vast quanities of
chocolate. Most people don't use pills as a
general drug but more as a recreational
drug for clubbing. The person w h o wrote
this article has obviously had a bad experi-
ence with pills, and although this does hap-
pen to most people every so often, it is
usually due to misuse of the drug and a
general lack of c o m m o n sense. The effects
of pills described in the article are uncom-
m o n and It sounds as if she's been given
a dodgy deal. Pills aren't g o o d or bad but
they are individual, so don't get caught in
a Rutt and think they are the spawn of
Satan, because they're not.

Get Your Kit Off!
Dear Felix,
As a former SNkPJer myself, I feel I
should clear up this matter of gender for the
SNKPJ. This week's Felix [Issue 1132 - Ed] (p
12) states that you must be male to partic-
ipate in the SNKPJ. The Police are adamant
that this is not really acceptable, and are
liable to charge people this year. When I got
caught in my first year, they said that they
could quite easily have charged m e with
public indecency (£1000 fine and 14 days
in jail), but w o u l d have no case against me
if there were a female participant. The lack
of females in previous years is not due to
any rule or tradition, merely that none of
t h e m have the courage to get their kit off
and run naked for charity. The reasoning
behind the official viewpoint is that w o m e n
are allowed to be offended if they see
men's tackle, but not if there are a few fan-
nies on s h o w as well. This is mad, but there
is a legal precedent, so that's what counts.
In fact, a few years ago, a female mem-
ber of college volunteered for the SNKPJ.
Unfortunately, she got sponsored more
money _ n o t _ to take her kit off, so stayed
at h o m e . Can I also add that the SNKPJ was
one of the weirdest and proudest moments
of my life, running past the screaming
crowds, stopping traffic, and generally hav-
ing a laugh. The victory lap round the Albert
Hall singing 'Rule Britannia' should be rein-
stated this year, if people have the energy.
Cheers,
M i k e
