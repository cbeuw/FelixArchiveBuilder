CCU's do battle
C&G29-19RCS
The l o n g awaited s h o w d o w n b e t w e e n
then C C U s h a d b e e n given extra m e a n -
ing by t h e verbal activities o f Dave "it's
a forgone c o n c l u s i o n " H o g g .
W e d n e s d a y a f t e r n o o n s a w t h e
a s s e m b l i n g o f a s t r o n g C & G U t e a m
teaming with talent a n d expertise. C & G
w e r e f o r c e d to d e p l e t e o u r reserves
b e n c h with t h e loss o f C&G's Adrian
"Flying h o o k e r " Jacobs to t h e RCS w i n g .
This error o f j u d g e m e n t w a s paid for in
the first f e w minutes w h e n small patch
of wind assisted RCS pressure c o n c l u d e d
with t h e flying hooker crossing over t h e
line to m a k e it a 0-7 nightmare start.
The sturdy m e n at C&G responded by
blasting up t h e pitch for Dave "Energlzer
bunny" Pearce to dive over. A reluc-
tance to soil their n e w shirt by tackling
was cruelly exploited by A n d y fittle w h o
took a light j o g through their defence.
O u r b o y Sven scored a n o t h e r c o n -
verted try a n d half-time b r o u g h t t h e
wind to our backs with t h e score 17-7.
The s e c o n d half started with a mighty
RCS push into our steely d e f e n c e . C & G
took e v e r y t h i n g a n d w a n t e d m o r e ,
repulsing attacks with c r u n c h i n g tackles
from Nipply, Sven, John a n d everyone.
Mistakes w e r e p u n i s h e d , t h e Sublime
Chicmutter ran half t h e length o f t h e
pitch to score shortly followed by a scyth-
ing run f r o m Sven.
RCS pulled themselves out o f t h e
m u d a n d started to s h o w us h o w it
should d o n e scoring 2 late tries giving
C&G a nervous last 5 minutes. T h e mar-
gin b e t w e e n t h e t e a m s w a s m e a s u r e d
in brutal tackling everywhere a n d s o m e
hard r u n n i n g f r o m Will a n d Sven.
Another day, another ref., things c o u l d
have b e e n different, but as t h e s u n set
over Harlington it w a s t h e C & G b o y s
signing in t h e circle.
Sam Hignett is a first year Materials stu-
dent at Imperial. But h e also spends a
third o f his year d o i n g s o m e t h i n g mar-
ginally m o r e interesting - driving racing
cars. H e w a s interviewed about his pas-
sion:
Tell us about your racing?
I reckon that all told, I will s p e n d about
100 days in a racing car this year.
The Formula Vauxhall Is your major
championship this year. Tell us about It.
Well in '99 I a m driving for John Vilage
A u t o m o t i v e in t h e British Formula Vaux-
hall C h a m p i o n s h i p , racing a lOOcc T K M
kart a n d d o i n g a c o u p l e o f Formula Ford
races. That's all at t h e m o m e n t .
That's all. How much time does that take
up?
It Is 16 races all a r o u n d t h e country o n
the T O C A package, so I a m o n e o f t h e
support races for t h e British Touring Car
C h a m p i o n s h i p . There is full satellite a n d
s o m e terrestrial television coverage a n d
plenty o f press coverage, so it is a really
g o o d c h a m p i o n s h i p for y o u n g u p a n d
c o m i n g drivers.
And the car?
It's a single seater, so the w h e e l s stick
out like a F1 car, but it has n o wings or
other d o w n f o r c e aids. I a m told that off
the line, if y o u get it right, it will g o f r o m
0 - l O O m p h in under 5 s e c o n d s so it is
pretty quick. All the cars are identical a n d
so it is just u p t o t h e driver a n d the e n g i -
neer t o set t h e car u p a n d m a k e it c o m -
petitive at each circuit. At s o m e w h e r e
short like Brands indy circuit there is less
than a s e c o n d b e t w e e n pole a n d 20th
o n t h e grid s o it is close hard racing.
INTERVIEW
You said about your engineer - what
does he do?
H e looks after m y car basically. H e
makes a n y adjustments that n e e d to b e
m a d e , prepares the car before I drive it
a n d rebuilds it w h e n I crash it. The rela-
tionship that y o u have with your e n g i -
neer is really important a n d c a n b e t h e
difference b e t w e e n w i n n i n g a n d losing.
It is t h e s a m e for all the guys that I w o r k
with. I have a m a n a g e r , a g u y w h o
does the PR work for me, t h e team m a n -
ager a n d my engineer. If y o u w o r k hard
for t h e m a n d s h o w enthusiasm they will
work hard for y o u , a n d y o u will be c o m -
petitive.
How does all this affect your life as a stu-
dent?
Well at times I a m testing twice a w e e k
and racing all w e e k e n d , that means I a m
d o i n g up to 800 racing miles a n d 600
travelling miles a w e e k , so it c a n be
quite a strain. Work hard, play hard.
And what about your social life?
N o , that doesn't suffer. I a m really lucky
in that all my friends are really support-
ive o f what I d o a n d so help m e out a
lot. I don't really drink, that's a fitness
thing, but I still have a real laugh a n d
m a k e an arse of myself as m u c h as a n y
drunk person. Actually I a m quite g o o d
at that.
So you have to be fit to race?
Yes, reasonably. It is as m u c h about
b e i n g able to concentrate in extreme
environments. It isn't that hard physically
to drive the car, it is c o p i n g w i l h the G-
loadings a n d k e e p i n g a clear head. Also
the fitter y o u are the less likely y o u are
to injure yourself w h e n y o u stick the car
in a wall, a n d so t h e sooner y o u can get
back into t h e car.
Accidents I suppose are part of the job?
Well most o f us will try to avoid having
a c c i d e n t s , but they h a p p e n simply
because y o u are s o close to t h e edge. I
think that I a m quite g o o d a n d generally
don't crash race cars, but t h e f o r m u l a
Vauxhall c h a m p i o n s h i p is pretty aggres-
sive a n d there is a fair a m o u n t o f c o n -
tact, s o there are quite a f e w m o m e n t s .
How do your family view your racing with
the risks Involved?
They are great a n d w e r e t h e o n e s w h o
got m e into it in the first place a n d so are
well aware that t h e highs are high a n d
the lows are low. N o , they are all really
supportive as is m y girlfriend, a n d I think
she gets t h e worst o f it s o m e t i m e s .
It all sounds quite serious, Is It?
It wasn't, but it is b e g i n n i n g to d a w n o n
m e h o w serious it is all getting. Contracts
have six digits in t h e m a n d m y girlfriend
met s o m e r a n d o m bloke in f ranee w h o ,
m u c h to her surprise, m e n t i o n e d my
n a m e w h e n talking about motor racing.
I s i g n e d a contract t h e other day that
stated that I wasn't allowed to ski, rock
climb, parachute or partake in any other
d a n g e r o u s activities for t h e rest o f the
year.
What about the future, what do you
hope to do?
O n e season at a time. Let's see h o w w e
g o this year.
But do you have any exciting plans or
opportunities?
I a m d o i n g a publicity p h o t o shoot with
o n e of t h e girls w h o m o d e l s these w o n -
der b r a things.
You have a glrlfrelnd
Yeah.
