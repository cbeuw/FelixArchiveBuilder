After an u n p r o m i s i n g start (see Page 1),
the inaugural IC M e d School Rag W e e k
took-off last week, c o m b i n i n g traditional
elements a n d events f r o m t h e Charing
Cross a n d St Mary's calendar.
M o n d a y saw a series o f 'Rag G a m e s '
at Charing Cross, d e s i g n e d to c o n c l u -
sively prove which c a m p u s is h o m e t o t h e
superior students. In a quest to secure ulti-
mate victory for their team, students from
BMS, St Mary's a n d t h e Cross p e r f o r m e d
a variety o f increasingly b i z z a r e ( a n d
hugely entertaining games), largely based
around t h e twin Rag t h e m e s of nudity
and drinking.
A close-run contest thus s a w Mary's
victorious in t h e T u b t h u m p i n g _ _ _ „

sive victory in the parsnip g a m e (covering
a parsnip with lipstick with your hands tied
b e h i n d your back...you had to be there).
H o w e v e r , t h e t o u g h e s t g a m e o f t h e
e v e n i n g - the e g g race - p r o d u c e d a
three-way draw, with n o n e o f t h e c o m -
pctitors m a n a g i n g to circumnavigate the
Reynolds' bar with their boiled eggs in
tact. Whilst this might s e e m simple, the
fact that t h e e g g s are inserted in your
boxer shorts a n d every girl in t h e r o o m is
under orders to break t h e m makes this a
very very d a n g e r o u s event.
The final result s a w Charing Cross
c o m e f r o m b e h i n d to score a victory,
and notch up a victory in the drinking con-
test whilst t h e scores w e r e b e i n g

T u e s d a y night s a w Rag revues at
both Charing Cross a n d St Mary's. Both
w e r e p a c k e d out a n d regarded as hilari-
ous by all those present. Wednesday saw
the first big fundraising event,
with t h e Invasion of London
l a u n c h e d f r o m every campus,
and securing a big pile of cash
for this year's charity, t h e
British Heart foundatiion.
The final t w o elements of
Rag W e e k - the Circle Line Pub
Crawl a n d the Rag Ball - took
place after Felix w e n t to press,
so look out for a full report in
next w e e k ' s edition.
Sedrick: Safe No Longer
By Ed Sexton
City a n d Guilds U n i o n mascot, Sedrick
Safe, has been stolen by the Royal College
of Science Union. The mascot w a s taken
sometime during the w e e k e n d o f 16-17
January, a n d is currently b e i n g held
securely at an undisclosed location.
C & G U declared t h e safe to b e their
violate mascot, m e a n i n g that it can be
stolen without fear o f prosecution, earlier
o n tfH.; term. The decision w a s allegedly
taken in the h o p e that C & G U w o u l d rid
itself o f t h e safe, a n aspiration w h i c h
would seem to have b e e n fulfilled. Appar-
ently it would have cost C & G U around fifty
p o u n d s to have the safe removed, as it
w e i g h s about half a tonne. Exactly h o w
RCSU removed the safe is u n k n o w n , but
it w a s raised u p o n blocks, making lifting
it with a fork lift relatively easy.
At the time of writing RCSU had yet to
o p e n the safe door, m e a n i n g that accord-
ing to C & G U sources "they have yet to get
the w h o l e mascot". With the decline of
mascotry in recent years what will happen
next is o p e n to debate. C & G U could
reclaim Sedrick by paying £50 to RAG, or
they could decide to steal the safe back
off the RCSU. Given their apparent desire
to throw out the safe, they may simply for-
get about it, leaving RCSU with the task of
picking the lock.
Last Tuesday saw the start of International Week, where societies make use of the
opportunity to recruit new members and heighten the awareness of their region.
