After months of growing speculation,
rumour a n d denial the engagement has been
announced between M r . M i c h a e l Doherty a n d
M r . Martin Doughty.
It must be admitted that the o l d cliche
" w e ' r e only g o o d f r i e n d s " w a s wearing a little
thin a n d few people really believed that it w a s
a mutual love of w o m e n that had brought them
together.
Court correspondent Jonathan G o n a d
writes: " T h e couple are believed to have first
met at a gangbang near O l y m p i a . M r . Doherty,
known to his friends as " d i p p e r " , denies that
he took part by virtue of going first. A w o m a n
is also believed to have been present though
several eye-witnesses dispute this. O n l y re-
cently the couple were seen d a n c i n g together
at a Beit Hall party a n d managed to explain it
away by using a subwarden as a f r o n t . "
A s the processional car pulled into Prince
Consort Road large c r o w d s h a d to be re-
strained by police, s o m e a r m e d though many
legless. Cries of " s h o w us your bobby's hel-
m e t " were clearly audible above the cheering
of the gathering.
It is understood that M r . Doughty m a y take
a courtesy title. Readers are invited to send in
suggestions to the editor.
M A R T I N DOUGHTY
UP SlUiT CREEK!
NOTE:
Where quotation marks surround anything that
Mr. Doughty has said, speak it to yourself with
a very nasally, almost puffy voice.
Where quotation marks surround anything
that I have said, speak it with a firm, mascu-
line, but not too butch, voice.
It'll help you get the picture.
I w a s first introduced to M r . Martin " h o w ' s your
b u m " Doughty a couple of weeks before he ran off
to live with m y girlfriend.
W h e n they went to live in Oxford
seen the last of him — not so lucky.
thought I'd
On returning to college this year w h o s h o u l d I
see strolling out of the U n i o n A r c h but the c o y
faced, sore b u m m e d , under worked, over sexed
M r . G . M . Doughty (didn't y o u know he has a " G "
in his name -— doesn't tell many people).
W e l l , didn't have time to turn round a n d pretend
I'd left m y coat back in C h e m . Eng., so I just kept
on going, expecting h i m to call my name.
" O y — get my D a v i d Bowie h a i r c u t . "
— not an unexpected first c o m m e n t from Mar-
tin, even though I hadn't seen h i m for over a
year.
" B l o o d y Q u e e n , " I w a s thinking.
" S h e wasn't so good after a l l , " he w a s telling
me . . .
From then on it went from b a d to worse, he
started phoning m e up, calling m e " h i s f r i e n d " —
you c a n imagine h o w horrible it ail became.
Pretty soon he w a s a feature writer for several
well-known newspapers — " T h e H i g h Peak Repor-
ter", " F e l i x " , a n d even " T h e G u a r d i a n " once (by
mistake) — sending the same articles everywhere,
hoping for the break.
I w a s never sure what he w a s trying to do in hfe
articles — so I went round to his flat a n d a s k * J
him. A long time later w h e n he finally stopped talk-
ing about himself a n d his David B o w i e haircut 1
realized h e ' d missed the point.
" L o o k , " I said, " y o u r articles use information
that Paul Foot threw out last year. W h a t do y o u
say about t h a t ? "
M a y b e I w o u l d get my answer n o w !
" D o you like my David B o w i e h a i r c u t , " he Whin-
nied. H e continued, " J u s t bought a n e w a l b u m by
George M e l l y — he writes film c r i t i c i s m s for the
'Observer' a n d plays the sax. with a trad, jazz band.
He's great a n d he's m y hero.
" I ' m learning sax. n o w too. D ' y wanna hear m e
play, M i k e . D o you . . ? "
A n d so it went on. Painful.
After three hours in his flat I realized I'd spent a
whole evening with a b u n c h of shining w i t s . I refer
you to Prof Spooner.
I don't often write in " F e l i x " — a n d it m a y be
rumoured, therefore, that this article has been writ-
ten in revenge for certain references, made in M r
Doughty's c o l u m n , about me taking part in a gang-
bang in O l y m p i a . That is absolutely not the reason
— in fact it couldn't be further from the truth. I a m
writing this article out of complete boredom Wifrt
revision a n d the fact that M r . Doughty continuously
takes the piss out of m e in his banal, self-indulgent
asinine a n d completely trivial articles is of no inter-
est to me whatsoever.
Besides, what's a gangbang?
A n y w a y , enough s a i d . Don't w a n t to go o n too

If you ever look at the
advertisements on the sides
of London buses, chances
are you've seen the " H A R -
R O D S S T O P . . . E V E R Y -
T H I N G L O N D O N . . .
S T O P . " T h e widely held
belief which this is aimed
at propagating is that at
Harrods of Knightsbridge,
SW1, Ltd.. y o u can buy
literally everything. The
London guides to incom-
ing tourists say just that.
It is not true.
A s the House of Fraser,
Harrods parent company,
their ever soaring profits
have sought to increase
(Sir Hugh Fraser is Guar-
dian businessman of the
year) they have been re-
lentlessly pruning the store
of any sections which are
not geared to m a x i m u m
profit. A few remain, for
instance the bank and the
zoo, but only because, in
their very different ways,
they are both great crowd
pullers. Over the past few
years, however, the follow-
ing low yield departments
have disappeared:—
Key Cutting
Heel Bar
Post Office (not even a
posting box now).
The banking hall has
moved up to the fourth
floor from the more con-
venient ground level to be
replaced by a large and
very profitable perfumery
section.
The lounge, daytime
sleeping quarters of the
old Knightsbridge dears
complete with trailing furs
and mini-dog has moved
from the ground to the
fourth and the library has
gone to a remote corner
of the third, lost amid the
gigantic beds and four
poster baths of the furni-
ture department. T h e lat-
est victim is musical in-
struments. Clarinets, vio-
lins and trombones were
all half-price in the Janu-
ary sale only because the
super-store was getting
rid of them all and now
only deals in pianos, plus
guitars and recorders now
in the toy department.
A n d what of the Har-
rods customers? Typically,
Harrods customers, or, at
least, the ones that matter
to the House of Fraser,
can be divided into two
types: R i c h inhabitants of
SW1 and other such post-
codes and rich inhabitants
of U S A and other such
corruptions. T h e latter of
course seasonal and i m -
pressed; the male the lar-
ger of the species sporting
phosphorescent g r e e n
chequered suit and exhib-
iting a hang-up about
toilets:
"Say Mack. Where's the
bathroom?" whispers Wil-
bur.
" D o you want to buy
one or use one?"
The former are resident
and bemoaning the Har-
rods of late. M a n y re-
peatedly claim they are
close relations of the
Queen and, therefore, de-
serving of better and all
appear to have little sense
of direction as they are de-
livered by taxi, pointed in
the direction of the lifts by
the green m a n at the door
and pointed towards the
requisite department by
the liftman.
"Does this lift go to
C h i n a ? "
" N o . It just goes up and
down." N o marks for
guessing who said that.
" C a n I bring my dog
u p ? " Words fail.
When there's a sale on
(and Harrods sales do
have the odd bargain) the
regular customers try and
make out that they
wouldn't have come if
they'd known — despite
the place being plastered
with S A L E posters and
ten times the number of
people inside.
" G o o d grief! It's aw-
fully crowded today. Is
there a sale on or some-
thing?"
" Y e s . "
"I thought there were a
lot of those dreadful east-
enders about the place."
That was a guy about
thirty!
The Harrods customer
often appears to have
more money than sense,
likes a record cover and
buys the record for the
Hon. James who doesn't
like it and it gets sent
back. The Harrods bur-
eaucracy is appalling. It
may take a letter sent to
the store a week to get
through to the right de-
partment. The reply then
takes a week to be typed
and sent out. Meanwhile
the complainant, anger
and frustration increasing
daily, sends further let-
ters higher on up the heir-
archy as a reply fails to
materialise. It is not un-
known for Sir H u g h s
memo to arrive in the de-
partment before the orig-
inal correspondence.
A n d finally, Harrods
customers, irate in defer-
ence to their own self-im-
portance, love to splurge
out vague and belligerent,
notes about something fal-
ling apart (and they do)
which they bought a few
months before in the Way •
In boutique and t i n *
shouldn't happen because
it's Harrods and no they
haven't got a receipt and
they sent the garment by
separate post which Har-
rods must have lost but ii.
cost £12.50 and Harrods7
in recognition of their own
pathetic bureaucracy and
in preservation of their
public image pay up —
by the hundreds.
Y o u know, I reckon it
might be worth a try . . .
Just give yourself another
barrel to the name and
your £10 will come back;
by return. Well, not quite
by return,
