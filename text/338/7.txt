I hope that y o u have enjoyed this year at Imperial
College. I most definitely have done so. I shall be leav-
ing the U n i o n Office for the last time at the end of
July so this treatise will ooze nostalgia for the next
few paragraphs.
Martin's B i t this year has been witty, informative, a
mirror o f the U n i o n Bureaucracy and factually accu-
rate. It has reflected the trend i n the College and U n i o n
to return to, perhaps, a more traditional style of life.
M o r e people, for example, are going to Dinner i n H a l l
now than during the last few years. T h e interest i n
inascotry is brewing again—I c a n almost see M i k e
once more sitting on its plinth in the lower lounge. O u r
sporting clubs are thrashing a l l opposition and bringing
back vast numbers of silver cups.
It is very difficult to pick out one or two events
during the year which are especially worthy of men-
tion. I suppose that the profusion of elections stand
out i n most minds but there have been other things:
every U n i o n Meeting bar two was closed due to i n -
quoracy, the new U n i o n lounge bar is still not opened,
Piers C o r b y n is still wearing the same pullover that
he had i n my first year. The politics of I.C. U n i o n have
gone full circle. Piers was president of the U n i o n i n
1969, his H o n . Secretary', K e i t h Guy, had been Chair-
m a n of both Ents and the Conservative Society. Next
session with N o r m a n Sayles in the H o t Seat, shortly to
be vacated by Comrade Lane, we are promised a year
of moderacy; I think P a u l Wadsworth must have a few
capitalist leanings—Ents made £1,000 profit this year
(the money has been spent on a new carpet i n Southsidc
Upper Lounge).
I have tried to take as much part in the life of the
College as I could. 1 realise nobody will believe me
when I say that I have been working so hard for the
U n i o n that I haven't had time to find myself a j o b —
but it's true. When M G B leaves I.C., unless something
turns up in a Micawber-like fashion, he will be un-
employed.
But enough of this—to business. There are one or
two happenings worthy of note.
The Council D & D will take place on Friday, 22nd
lune, 1973. Tickets, available from me, are only £2.25
each which includes a full dinner, sherry, wines and
port, a cabaret and a bar until 3 a.m. The Guest Speak-
er will be fan Hogg, Esq., P.C.
Miss L i n d a Creagh, the U n i o n Clerk, is leaving at
the end of term to get married. W e will be making a
small presentation to her to mark her "retirement".
Anyone who wants to contribute should send or bring
his donations to me (cheques made payable to I.C.
Union).
I a m still interested in buying copies of photographs
of me doing interesting/silly things to show to my grand-
children when I'm rich and famous. This is a serious
notice and should not be treated either lightly o r with
subtle references to Lords Lambton and Jellicoc.
The I.C. Union Colours List appears elsewhere in
Felix. Ties c a n be purchased from the bookshop. If
anybody can think of a suitable substitute for a tic
for a lady please let me know.
I a m informed by reliable sources that there is a cycle
thief at large i n I.C. Please lock up your cycle when
you leave it at College—you know it makes sense.

VAC INVOLVEMENT
Dear Editor, . ,
We are wondering i f y o u would be so kind as to include
this letter i n your newspaper o r magazine, i n order, perhaps,
to catch those wavering beings who have not yet decided
how to spend their summer v a c ?
'The Foreign Legion is dead'. B u t there A R E alternatives
for a true hero or heroine of Modern Adventure. W h y not
come a n d spend your summer working with T h e Cyrenians?—
th4re are now Cyrenian projects i n many cities a n d towns
throughout England and Scotland.
The Cyrenians exist to care for uprooted, socially isolated
people who have nowhere to go. In the case of the single
homeless person the most needy are often rejected or repulsed
by the existing facilities; The Cyrenians t r y to reach those
forj whom no adequate provision exists, or who refuse to
acqept certain kinds of existing help.
They therefore set up projects, w h i c h may differ according
to ithe local need—which is, perhaps, for a night-shelter i n
Which there is food, overnight accommodation, a n d the offer
of Companionship; a second-tier house; or a third-tier, long-
terjn residential house. Cyrenian houses are small a n d i n -
fortnal, functioning as communities a n d not as hostels, a n d
generally offer no specialisation with one particular 'problem'
gropp or sex. Ideally, o u r residential communities accommo
datp about 10 residents along w i t h itwo o r three workers
although a shelter will have larger numbers. Worker identifi
cation is strong—Cyrenian workers live alongside the resi-
dents a n d share the life of the house i n all respects, getting
the same pocket money as a man on Social Security would
have. The idea of resident participation is also vital—resi-
dents are asked to co-operate i n the running o f the house
and participate i n the weekly house meetings.
Workers norriially come for a period of between six a n d
twelve months, but' we also need people for short-term periods
of between six and twelve weeks i n the summer.
If you are interested in finding out more write to: The
Cyrenians, 13 Wincheap, Canterbury, Kent.
Yours sincerely,
A N G E L A C R E E D ,
Administrator.
