FENCING
The end of the season sees the fencing club reaching
new heights of enthusiasm after a rather shaky start at
the beginning of the season. The main result for the
team has been a clean sweep in all its' fixtures in the
2nd division of the London League. Defeated teams
have included Nat. West Bank (7—2), Lloyds Bank
(5—4) and King's Cross F . C . (8—1). This means cer-
tain promotion to the first division next season and
thanks are due to regular team members Julian Tyson
(Capt.), Steve Thompson, Geoff e Kolbe, Gordon
M a c k a y and Lawrence Boyd.
C l u b individuals have also been featuring, promin-
ently in national and international competitions. K a y
Nicholson and Julian both fenced in the British Univer-
sities competition at Meadowbank in Edinburgh with
K a y reaching the quarter-final of the ladies' foil. K a y ,
Steve and Julian are all regular members of the L o n -
don University team with Julian gaining a place on
the highly successful University tour to Holland at
Easter. Julian also fences regularly in competitions with
considerable success, recently reaching the final of both
the foil and epie at the Nottingham National Tourna-
ment.
The club entered a Sabre team at the Leamington
Tournament held at Easter. Steve, R o m a n Gomez and
Gustavo Chapeia fenced well before being eliminated
by strong international competition. R o m a n reached
the last 16 of the individual competition before elimina-
tion. Steve has also represented Britain i n the under
20's sabre team, a very high distinction.
W i t h nearly a l l of this year's membership returning
in October plans are in hand for a 2nd team, hopefully
fencing i n the London League. T h e introduction of a
club evening meet is also proposed to increase the
social and drinking side of the sport which u p till now
has been rather neglected. This should prove popular
with members.
New members, including beginners, are needed for
next year — especially girls. N o experience is necessary
as there are plenty of willing young blades to show you
the basic positions — so come along girls! L D B
A selection of athletics photographs contributed by an un-
known beneficiary. Many thanks, it's great to have some pic-
tures at last . . . . but what the hell are they of, please??????
Next time, please let us know!
