In the Mines we have a l e c t u r e r who t e l l s us
not to take notes - i t stops us l i s t e n i n g to the
l e c t u r e - and s t i l l gets us s u c c e s s f u l l y through
the exams. He i s none other then J.B.Riohardson.
J.B. came t o the R.S.M. as a student i n 1907
and even then was e x c e p t i o n a l i n t h a t he d i d not
come from a mining, f a m i l y . I n f a c t , i t seems he
was persuaded by a f r i e n d , L.P.Harding, to come
here because of a s t r o n g d i s l i k e of o f f i c e work,
and a s t r o n g d e s i r e to p l a y rugger.
At t h a t time the R.S.M. played f i x t u r e s such
as would now make the I.C. team j u s t i f i a b l y j e a l -
ous. Consequently i t was no mean achievement f o r
Jack Richardson t o be s e l e c t e d as l e f t wing I,out-
s i d e Harding.
In 1910 he r e c e i v e d h i s A s s o c i a t e s h i p , and
went out to N i g e r i a w i t h a " t i n farming" concern,
a p t l y named Lucky Chance Mines. The country had
only r e c e n t l y been made a B r i t i s h p r o t e c t o r a t e ,
and was s t i l l the "white man's grave". When the
p a r t y of newcomers a r r i v e d i n N i g e r i a they were
met by a government guide, a c e r t a i n Mr. F i n c h ,
who, t a k i n g advantage of t h e i r i n e x p e r i e n c e . f o o l -
ed them i n t o t r a v e l l i n g h e a v i l y armed and p o s t i n g
s e n t r i e d a l l n i g h t round t h e i r camps. This joke
was g r e a t l y a p p r e c i a t e d by the o l d hands, who pro-
mptly nicknamed them "Finch's Boy Scouts".
However the r e s t of J.B.'s work there was not
so humorous. During one job h i s only European
companion, a l s o from the R.S.M., died of dysentry.
But J.B. s u r v i v e d two years i n West A f r i c a , which
gave him p l e n t y of scope to p r a c t i c e h i s hobby-of
s k e t c h i n g . An account of h i s journeys was pub-
l i s h e d i n the M i n i n g Magazine and the accompany-
ing drawings prove him to be no mere amateur.
In 1912 he r e t u r n e d to England and married.
He and h i s w i f e then went out to a B o l i v i a n t i n
mining company, f o r whioh he worked u n t i l the out-
break of the f i r s t World War.
He v o l u n t e e r e d f o r the Army, and, a f t e r v a r -
ious e n g i n e e r i n g posts i n B r i t a i n , was sent w i t h
the R.E.'s to France i n '17.
A f t e r the War J.B. went back to B o l i v i a , t h i s
time to an i s o l a t e d mine i n the Andes. While he
was there the n a t i v e s went on s t r i k e and t r i e d to
a s s a s s i n a t e the Europeans. For h a l f a week, both
day and n i g h t u n t i l support a r r i v e d , they had to
defend themselves w i t h Mausers - t h i s time i t was
not a j o k e .
A f t e r v a r i o u s jobs abroad he proved h i s v e r s -
a t i l i t y by changing to m e t a l l u r g y (1924-28), but
as he r e a d i l y p o i n t s out only so as to be w i t h h i s
wife and three c h i l d r e n .
Many students w i l l f e e l sympathetic when they
know t h a t J.B. once narrowly escaped being put i n
J a i l . He was General Manager at San Telmo i n
Spain d u r i n g the time of the Popular Front Govern-
ment. One day a l o c a l t a x - c o l l e c t o r a r r i v e d at
his o f f i c e and s t a r t e d to be obstreperous. J.B.
r e p l i e d a l i t t l e f o r c i b l y (Spanish can be such a
picturesque language ) and was promptly charged
w i t h "Defamation of the S t a t e " . He managed to
t a l k h i s way out of being j a i l e d , but i t was a near
t h i n g .
When the second World War came he was too o l d
for the f o r c e s , so was put i n charge of a R o y a l
Ordnance F a c t o r y i n Y o r k s h i r e . A f t e r the War he
returned to the R.S.M. as a l e c t u r e r , i n Mining,
and was e l e c t e d as Old Students Represantative on
C o u n c i l . H i s son d i d not f o l l o w h i s f a t h e r ' s pro-
f e s s i o n , but went to the G u i l d s i n s t e a d . J.B.
now hopes to have a g r a n d c h i l d at the R.C.S. to
even t h i n g s up.

Such was the theme of the l a t e s t c a r n i v a l . A
theme which p r o v i d e d the atmosphere of "Gay P a r i s "

So passed the l a t e hours . . . . the e a r l y hours

the new PHOENIX the f o l l o w i n g r e p l y was o b t a i n e d :
"Not bad.1
