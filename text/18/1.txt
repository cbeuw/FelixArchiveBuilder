REFECTORY COMMITTEE TRIES AGAIN
CATERING FIRM C A L L E D IN.
Aa foreshadowed i n the l a s t i s s u e of FELIX, the R e f e c t o r y Committee
has proposed and the Governing Body has agreed to a major change i n the
management of the I.C.Refectory. The Committee has been c o n s i d e r i n g f o r
some time a a e r i e s of p l a n s , based on f i g u r e s and i n f o r m a t i o n worked out i n
great d e t a i l by the present Management, which were designed to reduce the
y e a r l y d e f i c i t . S e v e r a l were discusaed at c o n s i d e r a b l e l e n g t h and the
eventual choice f e l l between two.
B r i e f l y , the f i r a t p l a n took the H o a t e l c a t e r i n g away from the
R e f e c t o r y , whioh would then have been used only f o r lunohea, teaa and
" f u n c t i o n s " . This p l a n was f i n a l l y shelved i n favour of the second
f o r v a r i o u s reasons, the p r i n c i p a l one perhaps b e i n g t h a t Bupport f o r i t was,
l e a a unanimous than the Committee f e l t was necessary to warrant recommendation
of ao d r a a t i c a atep.
The eeoond p l a n was to c a l l i n the f i r m of c a t e r e r s who had been
auocesaful at U.O. and see i f they could t a o k l e our problem w i t h equal succesa.|
This has bean done; and from E a s t e r the f i r m w i l l be i n charge of the
Refeotory. They w i l l be working w i t h and through the preaent R e f e c t o r y
Committee, whioh w i l l a t i l l be r e s p o n s i b l e f o r a l l matters of p o l i c y and f o r
any changes and r e o r g a n i z a t i o n whioh may from time to time be necessary.
The c a t e r i n g f i r m w i l l take over a f t e r Easter} and f o r the f i r a t
term no d r a s t i c changes are enviaaged. At the end of the Summer Term, they
expect to be i n a p o s i t i o n to make proposals to the Committee aa to ways and
meana of d e a l i n g w i t h our problem.
The Union Bar and the Ayrton H a l l Refeotory (Queenie's) are not
a f f e o t e d by t h i s new arrangement and w i l l oontinue under t h e i r preaent
managements.

Royal C o l l e g e s of A r t , Music and S c i -
ence - took p l a c e on 5&h February i n
I.C. Union. I t was the f i r s t 'pub-
l i c ' r e s u l t of the d e l i b e r a t i o n s of
an i n t e r c o l l e g i a t e committee, formed
to organize c l o s e r s o c i a l r e l a t i o n s
berween the c o l l e g e s . A debate on
the r e l a t i o n of A r t , Music and S c i e -
nce t o each o t h e r and t h e i r students
was f o l l o w e d by an i n f o r m a l b u f f e t -
dance. R.C.A. and R.C.M. students
were somewhat outnumbered by R.C.S.
A c o n s i d e r a b l e number of Miners and
Guildsmen were a l s o p r e s e n t . The
meeting was favoured w i t h the prese-
nce of Lord Falmouth, Chairman of the
Governing Body, the R e c t o r , and mem-
b e r s o f the academic s t a f f o f the
R.C.M. and R.C.A.
The chairman of the meeting was Mr. Frank Howes,
Music C r i t i c o f *;The Times', and a l s o a member of
the R.C.M. s t a f f . He reminded I.C. of t h e i r great
s t a r t i n a l r e a d y combining three c o l l e g e s i n t o one,
and then i n t r o d u c e d the s u b j e c t f o r the meeting:
how the students o f A r t , Music and the Sciences cou-
l d b a s t get t o g e t h e r , and l e a r n something of each
o t h e r . Tony de Reuck (R.C.S.) then spoke on the
broader purpose o f the scheme: on the m e r i t s of spe-
c i a l i z a t i o n v. g e n e r a l i z a t i o n , on pure, narrow ad-
vancement o f l e a r n i n g v. s o c i a l b e n e f i t , and c o n c l -
uded w i t h overwhelming support f o r h a v i n g the broad-
est grounding i n p r i n c i p l e s , e n a b l i n g the i n d i v i d u a l
to choose the n i c h e t h a t f i n a l l y i n t e r e s t s him.
Mr. J. Warrack (R.C.M.) opened h i s remarks w i t h
an o u t l i n e o f an i n t e r n a l problem of h i s c o l l e g e .
They l a c k a Union, and have f i r s t t o bridge the d i -
v i s i o n s o f ' c r a f t ' - of p i a n i s t s , s i n g e r s , compos-
ers and o r c h e s t r a l p l a y e r s . Mr. Aapura (R.U.A.)
chose as h i s main p o i n t tne n e c e s s i t y of g e t t i n g
to know each o t h e r ' s aims before attempting to share
and understand views. He denounced a present-day
tendency to accept second-hand o p i n i o n s as knowledge,
f o r l a c k of f i r s t - h a n d e x p e r i e n c e , and s t r e s s e d the
need f o r i n t e r n a t i o n a l exchange and t r a v e l g e n e r a l l y
i n s t u d e n t s ' e d u c a t i o n .
Speakers from the f l o o r v a r i o u s l y advocated
s p e c i a l ( o p t i o n a l ) l e c t u r e s , such as those on H i s t -
o r y of Science now running i n R.C.S., but wider i n
scape and .treatment, on each f a c u l t y ' s p r i n c i p l e s
and methods. Others took the o p p o s i t e v i e w , t h a t
l e c t u r e s would be a busman's e d u c a t i o n a l h o l i d a y at
home, and suggested t h a t exchanges would b e t t e r be
arranged over c o f f e e and l u n c h . One speaker w i s h -
ed t h a t the broad range of ' s c h o o l ' s u b j e c t s should
be c o n t i n u e d t o a h i g h e r s t a g e ; another p r o p h e s i e d
t h a t the schemes might produce ' S p e c i a l i s t s i n e v e r -
y t h i n g but t h e i r own subjÂ«ct(. Another sbeaker was
overheard to say t h a t i n the few minutes remaining
he would j u s t survey human knowledge!

i n g t h i s on at s h o r t n o t i c e due t o the I l l n e s s of
Mr. L.A.G.Strong. He p o i n t e d out how Science has
to e l i m i n a t e the human element from i t s methods -
the v e r y c o n t r a r y of our p r e s e n t attempts to 'human-
ize' our e d u c a t i o n . He p i c k e d out the p o i n t of the
need f o r understanding where o t h e r s ' a t t e n t i o n s are
f o c u s e d , and suggested the plan of a c t i o n s h o u l d be
the b r i n g i n g t o g e t h e r f i r s t l y of people: t h e n of
t h e i r i d e a s : and t h e n of t h e i r work.
