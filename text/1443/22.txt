Karolina Kurkova is a new mum
The best Scottish designer
An upcoming superstar
The 28 year old MA graduate from
Central St. Martins, Mark Fast, is
definitely a star to watch. His designs
have redefined the meaning of sexi-
ness; his clingy numbers feature stra-
tegically placed holes that give a new
meaning to subtlety.
Arguably difficult to wear, his crea-
tions are strangely addictive. Every
dress is made by the designer from the
start. Mark only works from the body
which contributes to the signature fit-
ted silhouette. In Mark’s own words,
his designs are for “a woman who
knows exactly what she wants. She
takes risks”. When he said she takes
risks, he meant it. In his first show
in London Fashion Week last season,
some of his dresses barely covered the
models’ backsides.
Mark Fast’s fame has been rapidly
rising over the last six months. His
debut minimalist knit creations have
quickly appeared in publications such
as The New York Times and Vogue. A
few dresses from his first debut show
have since found homes in Kristen
Stewart and Ellen Page’s wardrobe.
Mark’s dresses did not stay long on
Browns’ shelves – his last season’s sas-
sy, barely-there woven pieces quickly
sold out within a week.
But Mark Fast’s designs will soon
be available to everyone. Following
the footsteps of fellow designers such
as Giles Deacon, Mark has secured a
deal with Topshop to make his pieces
available to the masses. According to
Grazia, Mark’s collection will launch
in Feburary 2010.
Mark’s spring-summer 2010 col-
lection have used Swarovski crystals,
pearls, feathers and leather to max-
imise dimensions. The feathers give a
more feminine touch to his typically
detonatable dresses. The beads cer-
tainly give a somewhat 1920s touch to
the modernist collection, which also
featured a dress beautifully decorated
with conically folded fabric.
Besides the clothes, Mark Fast
caused controversy over the use of
three size 14 models on his recent cat-
walk. His stylist walked out three days
before the show, quoting “creative dif-
ferences over the use of larger sized
models”. Mark’s managing director,
Amanda May, told the Telegraph that
“we wanted women to know they don’t
have to be a size zero to wear a Mark
Fast dress - curvier women can look
even better in one”. It is however un-
deniable that it can be a game of Truth
or Dare for a curvier girl to step out in
a typical Mark Fast dress, since his de-
signs can be quite revealing and curve
hugging. Some people argue that the
use of size 0 and size 14 models only
– with no variation in between – is a
publicity stunt. But his move has surely
opened the doors for plus-size models
on the catwalk. Definitely a gesture
welcomed by the fashion world.
I
’ve embarked on a journey to find
an outfit that will break the bank
(it’s Christmas!), and make me
look like a diva. I can only take
advice from Carine Roitfeld or Franca
Sozzani - mix it, match it, rock it and
never forget to romanticise it.
Mark Fast = Clothesgasm. I’m com-
pletely smitten with this skirt. Totally
romantic, totally 20s glam.
Next - rock and roll. Adding safety
pins to my cotton biker jacket is some-
thing I tried to do, but this has failed to
yield any success so far. How do these
crazy Moschino ateliers do it? Straight
and neat?
Next - fetish. How about a pair of
12-inch, totally unwearable, but totally
fabulous shoes from Alexander Mc-
Queen’s SS10 RTW? I don’t care if the
pair snap my feet in half, I don’t care
if they are more expensive than bailing
out 10 banks- they are worth it.
Completing the look, I’ll go for 3.1
Phillip Lim’s studded gloves. Keeps me
warm, keeps me edgy.
Lastly, a clutch bound by brass butch-
ers chainmail by Made Her Think.
Skirt, £540. Jacket, £1705. Gloves,
£325. Clutch,
$1250. Shoes?
Priceless. And
Santa – Mas-
tercard is
hardly even
money!
