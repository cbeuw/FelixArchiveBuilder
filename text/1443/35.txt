How to play:
Solve the clues (given in order: top-to-bottom & left-to-right)

empty rows or columns in the solution.
Below is an example of what a solved grid might look like.

Well, Nonogram
returned last week, and
many of you seemed to
enjoy it, even though
there was no explanation
how to do it! So we put
one in. I hope that this
makes it easier. Winner

another new face. Keep
sending solution in and
