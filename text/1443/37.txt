Aunty McPickle is sick of you disgusting people. Eurgh
Dear Aunty McPickle,
One night last week, I met this girl
who was super hot and very very
keen. We went back to mine and
without any encouragement she un-
dressed and said sternly “lets just do
it”
. I could hardly believe my luck
and gleefully fell into bed.
She decided to go all deep throat
and again I was feeling pretty happy,
until she literally started to gag and
choke. Before I jump to safety, she
was spaghetti-sick all over my groin-
al districts. It was terrible. I imme-
diately sent her on her way and have
since had a lot of trouble with hun-
ger and sexual arousal.
What can I do?
Maximus Lupus
Dear Max,
I would avoid eating spaghetti for a
good while. Maybe you should try to get
over your trauma by trying expressing
it in art. It’s a pretty modern concept
and sure to ruffle some feathers if the
girl in question recognises the mess.
Hopefully with time you will dissociate
yourself from this horrific memory.
Yours, Aunty McPickle xxx
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I was in ethos the other day on a gym
date with this girl I have liked for
ages. I was trying to impress her by
lifting some hefty weights, when the
old man in front of me bent down
and farted in my mouth. It literally
tasted of macaroni cheese and I had
to stop myself from retching.
The girl however seemed to read this
suppressed retch face as guilty and
has since not so much as smiled in
my direction. HELP!
Gerhard Guffster
Dear Gerhard,
I hope this wasn’t also when the air
conditioning was kaputt at ethos?
Mmmmm the best thing might be to
just move on.
If it really smelt that bad, I doubt she’ll
be able to forget and explaining it will
just further incriminate you.
Sorry.

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have a problem with Sambuca. I
seem to get drunk and then com-
pletely forget that I shouldn’t drink
it. It gives me complete impotence
and is obviously pretty embarrass-
ing. What excuse can I give for not
drinking it? I hate my life.
Regards,
Spencer
Hi Spencer,
Drinking too much alcohol can affect
your ability to get and maintain an
erection (often called ‘brewer’s droop’).
In the longer term, it interferes with the
production of testosterone, which can
reduce your libido.
I suggest you watch your drinking in
general and maybe try to particularly
avoid spirits such as Sambuca.
You could just blame it on an intoler-
ance or allergy. If the problem doesn’t
go away you should consider going to
see the GP.

Usually spaghetti’s quite an appealing prospect after a night out, but not when it’s spewing out your girlfriend’s mouth and onto your pubes

Do you know those really annoy-
ing people at Tube stations waving
their collection buckets in your face,
while asking you for change? Those
wacky altruists who expect
you to donate some of your
hard-earned student loan
to a good cause? Well now’s
your chance to become one
of them!
