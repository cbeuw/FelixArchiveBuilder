There are loads of myths about sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) which range
from the totally ridiculous to worrying
truths. It is fair to say the risk you take
when you have unprotected sex is
more hassle than it is worth. This isn’t
a warning to abstain from sex; it should
be a personal choice. However, it makes
sense to carry a condom around with
you and use it the next time you get
lucky. The worry of pregnancy is a stress
that no student needs. However, even
if you or your partner are on the pill you
can still catch a range of infections. So
get yourself both checked out if you
haven’t already.
Needless to say, if you are experiencing
any symptoms it is really important
to have a check up soon. This can be
done at your local GUM (Genito-Urinary
Medicine) Clinic. These clinics can
offer you advice about contraception,
do regular screenings (if you have
no symptoms) or do specific tests (if
you are experiencing symptoms). If
you are sexually active and have had
unprotected sex it is really important that
you schedule one in, even if it is just for
peace of mind. Symptoms of sexually
transmitted infections include:
• A change in the normal discharge from
the vagina
• Discharge from the penis
• Sores or blisters near the vagina, penis
or anus
• Rash or irritation around the vagina,
penis or anus
• A burning feeling when peeing
• Pain during sex
The closest GUM Clinic to Imperial is:

there are some situations in which you

They also run a new walk-in sexual health
clinic, which requires no appointment. It
is held every Tuesday between 5pm and
7pm and operates on a first-come, first-
served basis. You can also book a slot
in advance by texting between 9am and
3pm on the day of the clinic you wish to
attend and you will be texted back a slot.
TEXT: ‘JHC slot’ to 07786202243
What will happen during your
appointment will vary depending on
why you are attending. Sometimes you
might just need advice or to give a urine
sample or prescriptions. Other times
will require an examination- this may be
external or it could be an internal swab.
This is dependent on what your concerns
are and whether you are experiencing
symptoms. Results are usually sent to
you via text within a week but you might
have to have a follow-up appointment
depending on the results.
All consultations are completely
confidential, but if you don’t feel
comfortable going to your local clinic
there are many options in London and
near your home. To find your closest
one, go to www.fpa.org and click on
‘find a clinic’. You can then type in your
postcode or address.
Did you know that:
• As many as 70% of women and 50%
of men who have an STI don’t have any
symptoms?
• The number of Chlamydia cases in
people under 25 has risen by over
200% in the last 10 years? This disease
is mostly symptomless but can lead to
infertility in women.
• Some STIs can lead to diseases such
as cancer (HPV) and central nervous
system disorders (syphilis)?
• You can catch some STIs through oral
sex?
There are loads of places to get
information and advice about sexual
health, both within Imperial and from
external organisations.
