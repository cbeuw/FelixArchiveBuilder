Drug Chief sacked by Home Secretary
James Goldsack reports on Professor David Nutt’s departure and the future for Science and the Government
L
ast Friday, the UK’s chief drugs
adviser was sacked by Home
Secretary Alan Johnson af-
ter criticizing government
policies.
David Nutt, Professor of Neuropsy-
chopharmacology at Imperial College
and Chair of the Advisory Council on
the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), criti-
cised the decision to reclassify canna-
bis to Class B from C.
Public concern over the increase in
availability of skunk and the possible
links to mental illness led the ACMD
to investigate the dangers of all forms
of cannabis in 2007-08.
The row over cannabis classification
flared up again last week as Prof Nutt
used a lecture at King’s College, Lon-
don, to question the “artificial” separa-
tion of alcohol and tobacco from illegal
drugs.
David Nutt said that according to the
scientific evidence, smoking cannabis
created only a “relatively small risk” of
psychotic illness.
In a letter to Prof Nutt, Alan Johnson
wrote: “I cannot have public confusion
between scientific advice and policy
and have therefore lost confidence in
your ability to advise me as chair of the
ACMD. I would therefore ask you to
step down from the Council with im-
mediate effect.”
“This is not about Prof Nutt’s views,
which I respect though I don’t agree
with them,” said Mr Johnson.
In his reply, Prof Nutt said he was
“disappointed” by Alan Johnson’s view
adding “whilst I accept that there is a
distinction between scientific advice
and government policy there is clearly
a degree of overlap. If scientists are
not allowed to engage in the debate it
undermines a major source of care-
fully considered and evidence-based
advice.”
Despite his sacking, Professor Nutt
stands by the evidence and his belief
that cannabis should not be a Class B
drug based upon its effects.
He described his sacking as a “seri-
ous challenge to the value of science in
relation to the government”.
“I am disappointed because, to be
honest, all I was trying to do was help.
I wasn’t challenging the government,”
said the former chief drugs advisor. “It
would be much simpler if they took
that advice rather than getting tangled
up I other sorts of messages which
frankly do confuse the public.”
Professor Nutt, a highly respected
leading addiction expert said he was
not prepared to “mislead” the public
about the effects of drugs to convey a
“message” on behalf of the government
instead of presenting the facts.
Phil Willis MP, chairman of the sci-
ence and technology select commit-
tee, said he would write to the Home
Secretary to ask for clarification as to
why Prof David Nutt had been sacked
“at a time when independent scientific
advice to government is essential”. “It
is disturbing if an independent scien-

T
he sacking of
ACMD Chair Pro-
fessor David Nutt
is an outrage. Sci-
entists must be
independent and report the
facts honestly and without
repression.
Even before the ACMD had
released its findings into canna-
bis, the government had decid-
ed to reclassify the drug to Class
B. That was a ridiculous move,
making the Council superflu-
ous and undermining scientific
evidence.
Just like any other illness, drug
abuse should be a public health
issue, not criminal. Harm re-
duction is the most important
objective, not criminalising the
vast number of people using il-
legal substances recreationally.
There is the argument that
increasing the classification of a
substance sends out a message
that drugs are bad. Surely then
every drug should be Class A.
This undermines the classifica-
tion system.
The point of the classification
system is to inform the public
on how harmful substances are.
It should be a scale built upon
truth and evidence, not second-
guessing and attempts to “warn”
people of dangers that are not
even there.
Jacqui Smith defended her
decision to ignore the ACMD’s
recommendation for cannabis
to remain a Class C substance
by claiming that the debate has
shifted due to the introduction
of skunk. However, it is exactly
this type of cannabis that the
ACMD investigated and what
prompted the report initially.
Is it not obvious that Prof Nutt
and the ACMD are more in-
formed of the evidence than any
politician? Not to Alan Johnson,
who disagrees with Prof Nutt’s
view on cannabis despite his ex-
pertise and time spent studying
the drug.
Ann Widdecombe, writing in
the Guardian, claims that there
is a united scientific view that
“drugs are harmless”
. This is
complete nonsense, drugs are
harmful but to differing degrees,
not all can be lumped in Class A.
The public need the truth, we
should not be hidden from it by
politicians who want nothing
more than to be re-elected by
the tabloid-reading electorate.
Alan Johnson has shown his
true colours, disregarding scien-
tific and expert advise just as his
predecessor Jacqui Smith did.
Science is important for edu-
cating the public and govern-
ment. Independence is neces-
sary for scientific advisors to
ensure free thought.
Reinstate Professor Nutt.

Science
Dismissed
P
oliticians have a long
history of “cherry-
picking” science.
One of Winston
Churchill’s lesser
known quotations that science
should be “on tap but not on
top” is as prevalent today as in
post-war Britain. The sacking
of Professor Nutt shows the
government dismissing scien-
tific recommendation in favour
of acting on public pressure. In
doing so, they undermine the
value of science and are pun-
ishing a man for exercising his
freedom of speech.
Perhaps where Professor Nutt
overstepped the line with the
government is confusing ‘evi-
dence’
, which cannot be disput-
ed with ‘advice’ which may be
ignored. Science is only one of
many factors which need to be
taken into account to give the
full picture; we cannot ignore
social and political aspects.
However, dismissing a man
for expressing views which con-
flict with the body he advises
is outrageous. Whether Nutt is
right to claim that alcohol and
tobacco are more damaging
than LSD and ecstasy – and the
research would suggest he is – is
not so much the issue as the ex-
pectation on scientists to deliver
facts without opinion.
Nutt’s view that the govern-
ment were giving mixed mes-
sages about the harm of drugs
to the public is one of the main
reasons Gordon Brown backed
the decision to sack the advisor
– along with the opinion he was
acting irresponsibly by down-
playing the risks associated with
certain substances. Yet no one
can deny that the U-turn in can-
nabis classification is a prime ex-
ample of such a mixed message.
Cannabis was reclassified back
to class B largely due to pub-
lic concern but also because of
rise in the popularity of ‘skunk’.
‘Skunk’ typically contains three
times the amount of tetrahydro-
cannabinol (THC) as cannabis
resin in addition to a decreased
concentration of cannabidiol
(CBD) – thought by some to re-
duce the effects of THC and so
make the drug less potent.
The drugs classification sys-
tem in Britain is very subjec-
tive and is heavily dominated by
public opinion. From a purely
medical stand point mush-
rooms, LSD and ecstasy should
all be graded as class B at the
very most. Putting them in class
A with heroin and other strong
opiates merely serves to mock
the whole classification system.
In this country, we all have the
right to free speech; scientists
should not be excluded from
this privilege.

tist should be removed for reporting
sound scientific advice.”
Shadow Home Secretary Chris Gray-
ling said Prof Nutt’s sacking was “inevi-
table” after his “latest ill-judged contri-
bution to the debate”.
However, Liberal Democrat Home
Affairs Spokesman Chris Huhne said
sacking the advisor was “disgraceful”.
He continued: “what is the point of
having independent scientific advice if
as soon as you get some advice that you
don’t like, you sack the person who has
given it to you?”
According to Mr Huhne, the govern-
ment may as well have a “committee of
tabloid newspaper editors to advise on
drugs policy”.
Former chief executive of the Medi-
cal Research Council and professor of
neuroscience at Oxford University, Prof
Colin Blakemore, said that independent
advisors should be expected to voice
concerns if their advice is rejected.
“I worry that the dismissal of Prof
Nutt will discourage academic and
clinical experts from offering their
knowledge and time to help the gov-
ernment in the future,” he said.
Earlier this week two other senior
scientific members of the ACMD re-
signed. Marion Walker, clinical di-
rector of Berkshire Healthcare NHS
Foundation Trust’s substance mis-
use service and member of the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society, and Dr Les
King, part-time advisor to the Depart-
ment of Health and senior chemist
on the ACMD both resigned over the
treatment of Prof Nutt. Dr King said,
“There is an extremely angry feeling
among most council members”.
Other senior scientific advisors to
the Home Office are “horrified” by the
sacking of Prof Nutt and Mr Johnson
faces the prospect of “collective action”
over the affair. The government’s chief
scientific advisor, Professor John Bed-
dington said, “the scientific evidence
[on cannabis effects and harm] is abso-
lutely clear cut. I would agree with it.”
Prof Nutt has claimed to have the fi-
nancial backing to set up a new coun-
cil to investigate drugs if the current
ACMD disbands. As it stands, the
Council is contravening its statutory
requirements, as there is no pharma-
cist on the board.
