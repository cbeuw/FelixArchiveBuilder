I
t would appear that I was a wee
bit on the angry side of things
last week. I don’t apologise, as I
was perfectly within my rights.
However it appears that a cer-
tain person ignored my rant and sent
me a snotty e-mail. They will be dealt
with in one of the most brutal ways
possible.
Anyhoo, I am glad to report that the
Union has asked some of its Fun Po-
lice to take a bit of a back seat, but they
are still there! Yet I do believe that the
Union is actually a good place to go.
Food wise there is a lot of work to be
done, but where else in South Ken can
you go to get a cheap drink, and then
take it outside to a chill in a (normally)
grassy Quadrange? The other thing is
that all the money we spend in the Un-
ion comes straight back to us, which is
nice, so I spend more.
Well, I think that is enough of Un-
ion fun loving for quite sometime, and
I will attempt to entertain you on the
subject of on goings in my life recently.
Humm, well in order of chronological
order I tore my foot up falling off a bus.
I mean what type of idiot parks his bus
up a distance from the kerb that your
brain tells you that you can make it
when in reality I had no way of travel-
ling from bus to pavement in one step?
But fuck me I was going to try it! I epic
failed. Moving on, me and a certain
female are giving it another go. I was
literally high fiving people on the night
bus. That was until I received many
strange looks and was forcibly re-
moved. I maintain the real Police toler-
ate less fun than the Union Fun Police.
(That’s a good story but the majority is
made up- ed). Finally I spent the week-
end down at Brands Hatch doing all the
mechanics with the race team I work a
bit for. We were doing pretty well, got a
second in the first race and were look-
ing good for two drivers on the podium
in the second. That was until one of our
drivers piled flat chat into the side of
another who had spun and come to
rest in the middle of the track. Luck-
ily neither was hurt, but it took a good
15 minutes to get them both out, the
marshals even put screens up round
the one car. We were shitting it and the
boss went hypersonic with rage, was all
a bit if an eye opener, because they are
just 17 and 20 and should have been
hurt. They were lucky boys indeed.
Stuff Imperial students like:
6. Pubic Transport:
We all love a good bus or tube so
packed you actually consider kiss-
ing the girl in front of you as the
train jolts. No? You haven’t even
been tempted before? Well I really
recommend it. You can also imple-
ment a base system if you really
want to. This will enable you to ex-
plain to your mates the exact nature
of the journey to college with rela-
tive ease. You can also all try to ‘out-
do’ each other on trips. So the base
system works as follows:
1. Knock in to her
2. Touch her bum
3. Accidently face plant her
4. Grab a whole handful of boob.
There is a bonus available if you
get her number/ she doesn’t scream
RAPE whilst point horrified at you.
To be honest you have to take the
rough with the smooth when it
comes to tube dating!
Flintoff was sure he nicked a fire engine
Arthur Lewis: “The difference between a drunk and a alcoholic is that a drunk doesn’t have to attend all those meetings.”

Ermm. Yes I managed to cock this up again.

In Cheon still managed to win! However this
one I have been assured is correct, but remem-
ber there is also and A in this word.

Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters.
Complete the puzzle and
then send the whole grid to

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in
a cell and must be surrounded with
a corresponding number of lines.
Lines cannot split and there can
only be one continuous line. Any
cells with no numbers can have any
number of lines. Look at the solu-
tion above for help.

Slitherlink was hotly contested
last week, with many answers fill-
ing our mailbox. And for this we
thank you, however we commend
Matthew Kelvin’s brilliant (and
winning) attempt. Well done.
