success in
Hatfield
Last weekend Imperial College’s Ul-
timate Frisbee Team, the discDoctors
(dD), went to Hatfield for the Indoor
Regionals.
dD1 got off to a good start, comfort-
ably winning their pool, conceding
only a handful of points on the way.
dD2 and dD3 had a tougher time in
the group stages, but fought valiantly
against talented opposition.
Later on in the day things started to
get interesting.
dD1 were aiming for a top 3 spot
to qualify for the Division 1 Nation-
als, while dD2 and dD3 were looking
to win matches against more evenly
matched opponents.
dD1 played the Mowhawks, repre-
senting the University of Sussex in a
very competitive and evenly matched 2
vs 3 game which the Mowhawks went
on to win 8-6.
Disappointed about losing for the
first time of the day, dD1 came out of
the blocks strongly during their next
game against the Surrey Scorpions,
taking a 5-0 lead.
What followed was a calamity of er-
rors, and an improvement in Surrey’s
performance, which lead to Surrey
coming back to 6-6. Fortunately dD1
pulled it out of the bag on sudden
death, winning 7-6.
dD2 and dD3 were enjoying them-
selves more against more evenly
matched opponents and won their
games to set up a dD2 vs dD3 final for
The Spoon.
An enjoyable match produced great
performances from the freshers and
experienced players, with dD2 sneak-
ing in a couple of extra scores to win.
dD1 then played Surrey Scorpions
again in a 3 vs 4 game which would de-
termine whether dD1 would qualify for
the Division 1 or Division 2 Nationals.
The Scorpions came out stronger in
this tie, and both teams were trading
points in another tight game.
After the final buzzer, Surrey had
emerged 7-6 victors placing dD1 in
fourth.
dD1 are looking forward to proving
their worth in the Division 2 Nation-
als in Manchester in a couple of weeks
time. All three discDoctors teams
emerged with an award, dD2 winning
the Spoon, dD3 winning the prize for
Best Spirit of the Game.
Warm up at The Foot
Chris O’Donnell Sailing
The weekend beginning 24th saw the
first event of the Sailing Club calendar,
and the first event for the new sailing
team - The “Foot Trophy”. It was host-
ed by The Castaways, known as Alum-
ni to the non-initiated, from University
of London sailing club.
The weekend was split up into team
racing on the first day, which for those
who don’t know; consists of two teams
of three boats racing against each other
in a low point scoring system, the team
with the lowest points wins the race
and the team that wins the most races,
wins the event.
The second day was taken up with
fleet racing where every man and
woman sails for themselves.
Our main competitors were the
current ULU teams, who were previ-
ous winners of BUSA, the nationwide
University team racing league, and the
Castaway team, the guys who won it.
Fencers mean business
Indy Leclercq Fencing
The Fencing men’s 1sts got their sea-
son off to a bright start last Saturday
at the London Team Trophy, organised
by the University of London Union
fencing club.
Open to all fencers in the capital, the
field was made up of universities (such
as UCL and ULU), and clubs (includ-
ing The London Thames Fencing Club
and Saxon) for a total of 42 teams.
The Imperial foil team emerged vic-
torious and the Epee team lost the final
by a single hit after extra time.
Despite not being at their most rested
(due to various amounts of Halloween
festivities the previous night), the four
foilists (Colin Auclair, Ed Collier, Rob
Shaw & Indy Leclercq) and three epee-
ists (Marcello Colombino, Alessandro
Costamagna & Ed Gilhead) turned up
at the crack of dawn (O.K 0930 GMT)
all fired up and ready to win.
The first team is in the premiership
this year, and this was the first chance
to test the new teams out before the
BUCS matches to be held in December.
Sluggish starts notwithstanding, the
top-seeded foilists raced through their
poule of four, laying waste to their more
modest opponents and taking less than
45 hits over the three matches.
They ended up ranked first after
poules, and in good shape for the
knockout round. The epeeists got
