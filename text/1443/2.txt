A consortium of 12 Europe-
an companies has launched
a sustainable energy initia-
tive to source European en-
ergy from the Sahara desert.
The Desertec Industrial Initia-
tive will start with a solar pow-
er project based in North Af-
rica which is expected to meet
15% of Europe’s energy needs
by 2050. It will require $400bn (£240) in investment, which will be provided
by companies including Deutsche Bank, Siemens, and E.On. The consortium
will be based in Munich, where one of the initiative’s founders, Munich Re,
is based. Throughout North Africa and the Middle East, vast arrays of solar-
thermal plants, which direct the sun’s light to heat water, will produce energy
throughout the day (and night). The super-heated water will drive steam tur-
bines to generate electricity. A network of hi-tech cables which limit conduc-
tive loss will then transmit the electricity back to Europe across the Mediter-
ranean. Desertec has stressed that some of the power generated by the Sahara
solar fields will also be used to power North African countries directly.
The world beyond
College walls

Hamid Karzai has been declared president of Afghanistan after officials
scrapped the second round of voting.
The second round, which was due to be held on November 7th, would have
seen Hamid Karzai pitted against his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, but the
latter withdrew from the race earlier this week. The first round saw Mr Kar-
zai come in with just under the 50% of the votes required to avoid a run-off,
whilst his opponent obtained just under a third of the votes. Hundreds of
thousands of ballots were discounted because of fraud allegations during the
marred elections. Indeed, Hamid Karzai lost a third of his votes between the
first and final counts. A day into his new five-year term, the President vowed
to battle corruption, and to lead an inclusive government. He also renewed
his call for the Taliban fighters to put down their arms, but they quickly re-
plied that they would continue their fight against the ‘puppet government’.
Mr Karzai’s pledge to root out corruption from his own government will be
closely watched by his American allies, as President Obama is considering
sending 40,000 more troops to fight in the country.

The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) hosted a summit
last week which also included some of the regions heavy-weights, China
and Japan.
South-East Asian countries are either rapidly recovering from the recent
economic crisis or have avoided it altogether. But the financial mess brought
on by America has certainly succeeded in renewing talk of a free-trade zone
that would link the world’s most dynamic economies. Japan’s Prime Minister
Yukio Hatoyama has said that such a zone should have a single currency and
‘lead the world’. Over the past decade, ASEAN has made much progress in re-
ducing tariffs, particularly on manufactured goods, but has so far avoided re-
forming trade regulation on farm imports. Intra-East Asian trade flows rose
to 42% of total trade in 2008, up from 32% in 1990, according to the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), and there is scope for further improvement.
All this talk of economic rapprochement is nothing new, and to some ob-
servers seems to be nothing more than a distant vision. Indeed, political
disputes within the region are as hot as ever, particularly between Thailand,
where the summit took place, and neighbouring Cambodia.
The two countries’ armies have clashed several times over a disputed tem-
ple at the border.

L
ast Friday saw the announce-
ment of the Central Union
election results. The newly
elected students are now full
members of Council. For those un-
familiar with the concept, Council is
the sovereign policy-making body for
our Union; it is a place that tends to
encourage democracy and civilised
discussion (for the most part) on is-
sues that affect students. The newly
elected members have as their duty to
represent the views of the student con-
stituents of their Faculty and do so at
monthly meetings.
According to an email sent out by
Mark Chamberlain, last year’s Medic
President and this year’s Council
Chair, the elections were not without
hiccups. In said e-mail, an allusion was
made to the fact that there were indeed
Class of 2010 Councillors elected
Afonso Campos reports on a new team to attend Council this year
issues that needed to be looked into
by saying that “complaints have been
dealt with”. felix is unaware of what is-
sues there were.
As usual, there are some positions
that remain yet to be filled; six in total
this year. The Non-Faculty position,
oftentimes taken up by the current
felix editor has not been filled either.
It is understandable as this position
is not open to a very great number of
students. You can still stand for elec-
tion in any of these empty Councillor
positions. Refer to the table on the left
to see exactly what roles are still va-
cant. There is further information on
Council and the roles you can run for
on http://www.imperialcollegeunion.
org/representation. To stand, email
the Council Chair your small mani-
festo as soon as possible, stating why
you would make a good representative
and come along to the next Council
meeting.
If you have any issues that you would
like to see raised in Council, you are
welcome to attend and make your
voice heard. The meetings are open to
all members of Imperial College Un-
ion and everyone has a say. If you feel
particularly strongly about an issue,
you may also write a paper and see it
debated and voted upon. It is suggest-
ed you approach one of your Faculty
councillors (list in the box on the left)
and speak to them about your paper.
So you have an idea, in the past, Coun-
cil has discussed varied issues such as
the Beer Tax, the twinning of Imperial
College Union with other universities
in Gaza and as recently as this week,
the status of mitigating circumstances
for students sitting exams.
Alternatively, you can just come
along and watch the evening’s antics.
It can be fun and there’s tea and coffee.
The new councillors will be joining Union President Ashley Brown and Council
Chair Mark Chamberlain. Pastel shirt and ICU lanyard compulsory
