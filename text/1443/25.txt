The Versus Round - Left4Dead2 Demo
It might just be the demo, but that hasn’t stopped Nick Virago and Jack Warren from feeling strongly about it
A
bloody marvel. It’s a
marvel really, that such
a thing was possible. In
just one short year we’ve
seen an engine overhaul,
an AI redesign, community support
and the small matter of five campaigns,
dozens of new weapons, a new game
mode and a gnome. A lot has been
added to Left4Dead2. It’s the sort of
upgrade that perhaps isn’t breaking
any new ground, but is surely cement-
ing value as a world leader in fast, in-
novative, iterative development.
What did we need from a sequel, first
and foremost? We needed new content
for one. So the new campaigns not only
provide more playing time than the
original, but also firmly place the pri-
ority on unique experiences for each
campaign. The ‘uncommon commons’
and melee weapons are special to each
of the movies, sure, but what I’m re-
ally talking about here are the variable
weather effects on Hard Rain. How
some campaigns are cyclic paths while
others are about fighting through to an
end point. How Hard Rain’s sugar cane
plantations attract a higher number
of witches, whilst the daylight of The
Parish affects the zombie eyesight. It’s
about providing new content, yes, but
also different content.
So you’ve got your new content. But
you need the gameplay itself to move
forwards too, right? So the AI infected
have learnt from human players’ ver-
sus tactics, leading to a
speedier tank and more
cautious smokers. The
survivor AI hangs
back with you now
instead of looking
for trouble, and
is a little quick-
er on the uptake
when things
start to turn
sour (which
they will).
Solid
and
improved. That’s what you need, and
that’s what Left4Dead2 is. Everything
that characterises this gaming series is
here - the dry humour, the surreal pop
culture references, the gleeful enjoy-
ment of chaos. All this has been worked
on to be faster, fuller and contrasted.
The good bits stand out now,
they’re pushed forwards and
made bigger and celebrated.
Key moments, high points
in games with your friends
are recognised, celebrated,
and given to you more fre-
quently. The boring parts
of the original are torn out
and replaced with more
exciting variants - gauntlet
runs to stop closet camp-
ing, spitters to keep you
moving. Jockeys to make
you giggle.
But this is Valve. So
what do you get, on top
of that? Well you get
more, don’t you? Of
course. So let’s keep
the existing Survival
and Versus modes, and
let’s add Scavenger, a
superb blend of the
aforementioned two
modes, and add that
in for short bursts
of competi-
tive play.
Then for
those who
mostly play
campaign,
there’s a Re-
alism mode
that switch-
es off glows,
makes spe-
cial infected
stronger, and
generally
emphasises
teamwork.
A
game
that
just one
year ago was
hitting shelves
with four cam-
paigns and two
versus is now a behemoth, with
a mode for everyone, swathes
of new content and a vastly im-
proved base game.
In a year. A year. How is that
not impressive? How can anyone
complain about rushed releases
of unfair money-grabbing? Even
from the demo, it’s clear just
how much has been added
to what has already been
picked as one of the best
360 games around, and the
finest online game of 2009.
A lot has been added. More than
enough to ensure a repeat perform-
ance in 2010.
When the demo comes online,
download and remember – you’ve
gained a lot, and in just twelve months.
Valve has done it again, and all you
need to do to appreciate that is to keep
that sense of perspective in mind.
“In a year.
That’s impressive.”
Opinionated bastard?

S
ince this has been a hot po-
tato for some time now,
it’s probably a good idea to
point out, early on, the fol-
lowing: I enjoyed Left4Dead
immensely. I ridiculed the boycott of
Left4Dead2 and I still think it’s a stu-
pid idea. I was looking forward to this
demo very much. Which is a shame,
because it’s utterly terrible. And
if this turns out to be rep-
resentative of the game
itself, I’m going to sorely
regret pre-ordering.
Where to start? Per-
haps with the original
game itself. Left4Dead
was a great, great balance
of maturity and humour,
of a quietly depressing
tone with light-hearted
chuckles. I spent night after
night for a good few months
after release playing Versus,
soaking up every bit of the
L4D canon, but it’s all tied
down to a base of death,
depression and loneliness.
Bit too emo? Maybe. But
Left4Dead’s atmosphere was
right. The night, the concrete,
the emptiness. It all fitted
together.
Left4Dead2 is
gaudy, to say the
least. New Orleans
is a bright, colour-
ful and cheerful
place, I get that,
but that means
you have to ask
yourself why it’s
the setting for the
sequel to such
a dark and rich
game. It’s cer-
tainly a change,
and maybe that’s
what Valve were
seeking. But I
can’t help but
feel it wasn’t the
right change to
make. It doesn’t
feel like a se-
quel to Left4Dead. It
doesn’t fit together.
Okay, now we’ve got the petty
whiny art shit out of the way,
let’s get down to the details.
Valve make simple games. Pared
down. Refined. They make games
where the rules fit on the back of
a matchbox yet actually becoming
an expert at the game takes years.
Five weapons. Four specials. That’s
it. Not so any more. Do you want
pistols or a melee weapon? Which
melee weapon? Do you want first
aid or a defibrilator? Automatic
sniper rifle? Shotgun? Silenced
weapons, for Christ’s sake? And in
the distance, is that a spitter or a fe-
male boomer? Is that a witch? Or is
that a which? Or... too late.
“Choice” is the watchword, and
choice has increased tenfold. But with
that choice comes an increase in com-
plexity too, and a loss of the elegance
that made the game so good in the first
place. During the demo you’ll switch
between different shotgun types, pis-
tols, back and forth from SMG to ri-
fle, never really knowing which one is
the best or whether the silencer even
does anything. This isn’t how it was
supposed to be. This wasn’t the code
to which their other games were built,
this isn’t the way of the company that
rigorously tests every change and addi-
tion with a wide group of gamers. This
isn’t fitting together.
Sometimes it’s not even that the em-
bellishments made things worse. It’s
that they just were utterly, emptily use-
less. The gore is entirely over the top,
for one thing, and is so disconnected
from the reality of the player’s actions
that it becomes a rather unspectacular
and bewildering sideshow, with zom-
bies arbitrarily dissolving into red mist
all around you. Wade in with melee
and the screen becomes coated with
red - all well and good for people who
like chuckling and high bodycounts,
but not so good for people who actual-
ly like to see the game they’re playing.
All in all, Left4Dead2 feels unfin-
ished. The team got together and
listed everything they wanted to add
to a sequel. If they’d taken only half of
those ideas through to the final game,
it would’ve been in far better shape. As
it stands, it feels like a bad mod - too
much added in without really refining
what was there, what the vi-
sion was. We can
only hope the
demo is the
weaker part
of the game.
Too late for
me, though.
No refunds
online.
Just...
regrets...
“It just
doesn’t feel
like a sequel.”
