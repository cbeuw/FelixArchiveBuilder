Your weekly business news round-up
This week a row has been growing
over the perceived slowness of the UK’s
prophesied economic recovery. Treas-
ury minister Liam Byrne claimed that
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne
had made a “complete clown of him-
self” for suggesting that the Govern-
ment’s plan to end the recession had
“failed”
. Criticism has also been coming,
as always, from the Lib Dems who saw
“stark contrast” between the perform-
ances of the UK and US economies.
Mr Byrne made three arguments in
favour of his government’s interven-
tionism. His first was that US politi-
cians and their advisors had “said the
stimulus was vital”. His second point
was that some countries that imple-
mented stimulus packages had seen
their economies’ key indicators pick
up. He argued that these “show one
thing above all - that economic stimu-
lus has worked.” Finally he pointed out
that Barack Obama (in so many words)
supported economic stimulus as a tool
to hasten economic recovery.
Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince
Cable has been broadly supportive of
the government’s policies but has chal-
lenged the effectiveness of their imple-
mentation. He has additionally called
for the financial sector to be shrunk,
relative to the overall size of the econo-
my. He also wants consumer and busi-
ness loans to become more accessible,
and personal debt to go down. His pro-
posals have some credibility because of
his partial prediction of the financial
crisis.
Mr Osborne was the only politician
to oppose quantitative easing and bank

Clockwise from top left: George Osborne, Vince Cable, the wrong Liam Byrne, Treasury minister Liam Byrne
Alan Sugar, of The Apprentice fame,
made controversial comments on
Tuesday that seemed to imply that
small businesses hit hard by the re-
cession should not be complaining.
“I can honestly say a lot of problems
you hear from people who are moan-
ing are from companies I wouldn’t
lend a penny to,” said Lord Sugar, who
has recently become the government’s
enterprise advisor. “They are bust and
they don’t need the bank - they need an
insolvency practitioner,” he added.
The Federation of Small Businesses
defended small firms struggling to
survive under current conditions by
claiming that small businesses “live in
the real world, not Disney World, and
they lie at the heart of our economy”,
adding that “they are not moaners and
the fact is they are working hard in dif-
ficult times and they need help from
our banks.” Lord Sugar’s criticisms of
the ‘moaners’ comes amidst his calls for
people to stop discussing the recession.
When asked about how the UK can get
out of it, he argued “ah £$%^&* can we
get off this bloody recession kick once
and for all? I don’t think we’re in one
now, okay?”
He has even been blaming the cur-
rent state of the economy on its cov-
erage, adding, “I think it’s about time
the media really assisted a little bit [by]
not talking about the recession.” Lord
Sugar offered small enterprises more
conciliatory words by claiming that
they do not need to be told that times
are tough. “It’s the businessman, err, or
bail-outs but has, without formally re-
tracting his position, increasingly shied
away from discussing his earlier pro-
posals, on account of public opinion
being strongly hostile towards them.
He has however been reminding voters
of the Prime Minister’s earlier claims
and his role in shaping the UK econo-
my in the eleven years before the start
of recession. “Gordon Brown’s claim
that we were ‘best placed’ now lies in
tatters” said Mr Osborne, arguing that
“we need credit and confidence to get
the British economy moving again.”
Ironically these latest spats has been
catalyzed by figures showing the US
recovering faster than the UK, which
are themselves highly suspicious. Even
on the Federal Government’s dubious
numbers, unemployment continues to
rise – although TARPisans like to ar-
gue that the rate of increase (or some
higher order derivative depending on
the month) of unemployment is falling.
In the financial markets, speculation
is strong and growing that the nomi-
nal gap between asset and real eco-
nomic performance is being caused by
government-pumped money. Evidence
supporting this view includes the un-
precedentedly high ratio between the
scale of the recovery and the depth of
the initial correction.
This creates a dilemma. There will
probably be an eventual withdrawal of
liquidity in order to reduce the risk of
excessive inflation. But this will cause
another painful market correction,
potentially sparking another round of
printing. These concerns have caused
the surge in currencies traditionally
viewed as risky to continue this week,
as the doubts rise about the USD’s
safe-haven status.

Just months after paying the EU almost
£1bn, Intel faces yet another lawsuit.
This time it has been filed by New
York’s Attorney General Andrew Cuo-
mo, following a two year investigation.
Presumably soon-to-be-Governor Cuo-
mo is accusing Intel of “illegal threats...
bribery and coercion.” The alleged
victims are manufacturers of personal
computers who Intel apparently tried to
intimidate into buying its chips instead
of those made by its rivals. This would
have been a novel marketing strategy,
but its effectiveness is doubtful given
the size of most PC manufacturers.
Intel responded that the lawsuit was
“just plain wrong...consumers, who have
consistently benefited from lower prices
and increased innovation, are not being
served by the decision to file a case now.”
The details of the case are even more
bizarre. Intel’s super-awesome plans
to dominate its market were undone
by its staff mentioning them in emails.
The ‘bribery and coercion’ turn out to
have been cash-back offers. The ‘illegal
threats’ were to withdraw these offers if
the manufacturers switched suppliers.
the businesswoman, who has to run
their business, and adapt to the climate
that they are in at the moment.” The
Lib Dem’s business spokesman John
Thurso warned the Prime Minister not
to “allow Lord Sugar’s celebrity to dis-
tract him from the absolutely desper-
ate message this sends.” Showing the
full force of his party’s wit he added, “if
he cannot get this, the Prime Minister
must tell him ‘you’re fired’.”
Gold prices have hit an all time high of
$1095.05 for an ounce on the London
market, after the Indian Central Bank
purchased 200 tonnes of the precious
metal from the International Monetary
Fund. The purchase is the latest of many
moves made in recent years by emerging
market governments to diversify out of
the US dollar.
After more than a decade of plan-
ning and negotiations, Disney has an-
nounced that it will be opening Shang-
hai Disneyland in 2014.
The new park will be built at an es-
timated cost of £2.2bn and will be
China’s second Disneyland. There are
concerns it may be competing with the
other one already operating in Hong
Kong. China already has 5,000 loca-
tions selling official Disney merchan-
dise. This will be the fourth Disneyland
outside the US, after Tokyo, Paris and
Hong Kong.
