ast Thursday, Cannibal
Corpse brought death metal
to Camden. The city’s band
t-shirt wearing, greasy-locks-
flowing metalhead population turned
out (I had a Mastodon top on) and
though KOKO wasn’t sold out, it was
bustling inside. There were three sup-
ports bands: Trigger the Bloodshed,
Annotations of an Autopsy and Dying
Fetus. I made sure to get there for the
latter because (and please just forget
the name) they are one of the most in-
dividual extreme metal bands around.
Their relentless blasting between
catchy choruses had everyone in the
mood when they finished. I honestly
think “Praise the Lord (Opium of the
Masses)” is the most danceable death
metal song on record. Yeah, danceable.
But we were there for the Corpse,
and the Corpse delivered. Everyone
who knows them (and if you’ve seen
Ace Ventura, you’ve seen Cannibal
Corpse) knows what to expect, suffice
to say it was insane. They’re touring on
a new album (Evisceration Plague) but
they played a career-spanning setlist,
delving back to their debut for “Skull
Full of Maggots” while thankfully
drawing mostly from classics Tomb of
the Mutilated and The Bleeding.
The sound was good, but perhaps
the staff of the indie-kid nesting site
KOKO weren’t totally prepared for the
relentlessly bass-heavy storm and if
you weren’t into moshing (and I’m not)
you probably ended up further back
than you would have liked. Still, the at-
mosphere had a pleasant camaraderie,
and everyone responded to charismat-
ic lead-vocals George “Corpsegrinder”
Fisher’s banter with enthusiasm.
Eventually, curfew came round and

George gave his last words. The crowd
pledged their support to death metal
with a sea of devil horns and prepared
for “Hammer Smashed Face”. With
the first power chord, the whole room
turned into a seething mosh pit, and
I allowed myself a frantic dash to the
front to adulate the band. It was an up-
lifting end to a crushing set.
I’m not sure Cannibal Corpse are
the band to convert new fans to death
metal, but there’s a reason they’ve sold
well over a million records over twenty
years. That night was a true highlight
for metal in today’s London.

an MacKaye has always been
something of a pioneer when it
comes to the world of music. First,
he formed the definitive – albeit
short-lived – hardcore punk band Mi-
nor Threat in 1980, setting a standard
for punk bands the world over with a
high quality production album released
on MacKaye’s own label, Dischord.
It’s at that time that he involuntarily
spawned a movement he described as
“Straight Edge”; rejecting the “sex, drugs
and rock n’ roll” creed of the punk com-
munity and openly admitting to the “un-
cool” healthy, vegan lifestyle he leads.
After Minor Threat’s break-up in
1983 due to “musical differences”,
MacKaye formed the highly influential
and critically acclaimed band Fugazi,
drawing the name from a Vietnam War
acronym meaning “Fucked Up, Got
Ambushed, Zipped In”. Though pre-
serving politically charged lyrics and a
DIY punk ethos, Fugazi expanded their
music in new directions, creating an
entire sub-genre: post-hardcore.
Whilst MacKaye was the main song-
writer for the first few records, their
long-awaited sixth studio album “The
Argument”, released in 2001, is the
work of four talented musicians at
their creative peak. Aside from multi-
Albums that you should know
ple guest vocalists and close friend Jer-
ry Brusher featuring on a second drum
kit/percussions throughout the album,
“The Argument” really stands out due
to the alchemy between MacKaye’s
heavy, low-end riffs, Joe Lally’s Latin
and dub-influenced basslines, and Guy
Picciotto’s scratchy, high-pitched gui-
tar wails. Not only do the guitars on
songs like “Epic Problem” intertwine
perfectly, but the vocals constantly
complete each other: as MacKaye
shouts anthemic lead vocals at the top
of the lungs, forcing the listener to
shout them back, Picciotto acts as a foil
(inspired by hip-hop) favouring a more

subtle, dynamic range of vocals – illus-
trated by the “Viva viva viva” chorus of
the brilliant “Life And Lime”.
Despite the complex start-stop beats
and sudden transitions from gentle
guitar chords to all out noise, this is
without a doubt Fugazi’s most acces-
sible, catchy and melodic album. From
the simple post-punk riffs and innate
rambling of “Cashout”, all the way to
the intricate guitar tapping on “Night-
hop”, there really is something for eve-
ryone here. Sadly, “The Argument”
was also Fugazi’s last album before
their indefinite hiatus in 2002. But the
post-hardcore scene spawned by Fu-
gazi still thrives today, and MacKaye
remains as prolific as ever.
