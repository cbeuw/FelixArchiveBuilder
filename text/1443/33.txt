20 year old girl + dragon costume (age 5-6) = above. We could
lighten up this picture and show you a camel toe. We wonâ€™t.
Should the BNP have
free media coverage?
Give them free media coverage - Iâ€™d love to watch some
alternative comedy for a change.

Theyâ€™re idiots. Giving them free media coverage will show
them for who they are. So let them. Question Time showed

Harbouring even more support for the BNP throughout the
country can only be a bad thing. We canâ€™t withold their right
to media coverage other parties recieve however. But thatâ€™s
the problem.
