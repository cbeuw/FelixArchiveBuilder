I like rap music,
there I said it...
I
told you there’d be a website
didn’t I? Make sure you check
it out, www.felixmusic.tk, and
remember now you can tell us
quickly and easily what you think of
the articles by commenting, so let the
troll within you free (or you could
criticize constructively, whatever that
means). Special thanks to our web-edi-
tor Christopher Walmsley for all his ef-
fort getting the website up. Also we’ve
started a felix music group on last.fm.
Every week, last.fm will calculate the
general music taste of the Imperial stu-
dents in the group and from this we’ll
create a top-40 of the most popular art-
ists/tracks for Imperial. Sign up to last.

our group last.fm/group/Felix+Music.
Now onto the music: I’m heading
back a little this week. 2Pac’s double
album All Eyez on Me, released in
1996, constitutes the epitome of 2Pac’s
thug sensibilities. He raps with preci-
sion on all the facets of a thug’s life: jail,
bitches, liquor, weed and death backed
up with bumping & grinding G-funk
grooves. He’s playful and thoughtful,
always referring to his own death (not
a clue that he’s still alive, but a reflec-
tion of the reality of his life) and while
he raps about being better than his en-
emies, his deft and smooth lyrical flow
proves it.
Even further back in time, The Last
Poets’ debut album titled The Last
Poets, dating all the way back from the
1970s, derides much of the behaviour
that 2Pac would later celebrate. This
group of poets and musicians basically
created rap music and in doing so laid
bare the problems that the black com-
munity faced. The fact that exhorta-
tions like “Wake up n***ers” weren’t
heeded make this album all the more
poignant.

Reviews
This single oozes power, with a post-
punk electric sound that resurfaces
memories of Joy Division. Sinister ee-
rie vocals, low-frequency drones and
moments of glory. Not light listening,
but a band to watch. -Luke Turner
The second single from the AIC album
is disappointing if we consider the edgy
darkness of the rest of the release. The
opening cello piece adds atmosphere but
it feels like a throwaway track to secure
airplay in the US. Unchallenging, slightly
whiny, reminiscent of (dare I say it) Nick-
elback. Well, it’s not that bad.

osmo Jarvis is a puzzle to
say the least. The 19 year old
is by no means a ‘finished
piece’. There’s too much raw
creativity rushing about, leaving too
many scuff marks lying around to re-
late him, or his talent, to polished mar-
ble. Truthfully, it’s not always fantastic
stuff, at times you find yourself wishing
a lyric here or there had been tweaked.
However, this is completely over-
shadowed by the powerful and play-
ful imagination behind the charming,
thoughtful and unconventional music.
He’s puzzling because he seems una-
fraid to write songs in almost every
style imaginable. Some songs mix
screaming punk vocals with quick-fire
spoken word, while an eclectic mixture
of banjo, blues guitar riffs and jazz pi-
ano jump in, straight out of nowhere,
just when you thought you’d gotten
to grips with his music. Sometimes
his music has a country-folk sensib-
litiy but at other times you wonder if
that’s not a little bit of reggae creeping
in from the periphery. He seems per-
fectly comfortable dipping in and out
of a range of genres and does so with
consummate skill and confidence.
Lyrically, Cosmo Jarvis becomes
even more puzzling. He’s constantly
juxtaposing style, elegantly rhyming
one line and then going off-kilter the
next. Luckily the music provides a firm
backdrop in front of which the thread-
like mental state of his characters are
displayed through the content and
form of his lyrics. He revels in mixed
messages like in the chorus of “Sun-
shine and Dandelions”, ‘sunshine and
dandelions/ severed heads and blood,/
first love on a sunny island/ bodies in
the mud”. Also in “Clean My Room”
One to watch - Cosmo Jarvis
With a reputation that precedes itself,
being reported as unlikely to feature in
the album, “Who’d Have Known” does
feature. The recycled melody appears
as the chorus, resembling the M&S
advert. It is a rarity where Ms. Allen is
not talking about drugs, sex or fame;
merely the feeling of blossoming new
love. She croons in her signature sick-
ly-sweet voice and that London twang,
all of the melodies allow a glimpse into
her domestic love-life. Reluctant to al-
low access to her private life, Ms. Allen
has turned this idea of young love on
its head by making a video for this song
based on the act of kidnap by an obses-
sive fan. - Joanna Cai
Breed 77 are a Gibraltarian-born band
currently based in the UK who fuse
their Pantera-inspired brand of heavy
metal with flamenco, resulting in some
interesting and genuinely original
songs. Aside from the typical endless
soloing and soaring choruses, front-
man Paul Isola makes the affair atypi-
cal by effortlessly switching between
English and Spanish, as well as going
from all-out growls to graceful sing-
ing. Though there’s nothing particu-
larly new about the heavy riffs, there’s
enough diversity in song structure and
tempo shifts to keep the average met-
al lover interested throughout. Plus
there’s a bitchin cover of The Cranber-
ries’ “Zombie”!! -Greg Power

The sound of a young, laid-back band
pulling melancholic indie pop from
their arses – and they don’t care. If they
were ‘hung up’ by a rope around their
neck they might have something more
to get excited about. Cheer up and take
a walk in the park. - Tom Jennings

This record sounds like sonic sun-
shine. Muted guitars, tinkling pianos
and crisp melodies meander through
the delightful ‘Rollerblades’ whilst in
contrast ‘Money box’ is an upbeat, ska-
like finger to all things materialistic.
The lyrics give an edge to these buoy-
ant pop songs with Eliza showing her
north London roots in ‘Police Car’ and
‘Go Home’. Comparisons with Regina
Spektor and the better bits of Lily Al-
len could easily be made but there’s
no formula-driven lyrical nonsense
here. Overall it’s an enjoyable, sunday-
morning of a record. - Tom Hird

“(If you’re wondering if I want you to)
I want you to” is an upbeat single from
the latest Weezer album consisting of
brash drumming, pleasant melodies and
the occasional percussion-led phrase of
what can only be described as a nerd’s at-
tempt to rap.
It features a playful acoustic guitar
theme behind the classic Californian
vocals of Rivers Cuomo; and although
it probably won’t be a golden oldie
in years to come, it makes for good
enough listening to at the present as
your standard Weezer song.

It can’t be said that this is original, but
this electro-folk-pop sound has haunt-
ing character. ‘Under The Sheets’, uses
electro sounds in a captivating way
that will make you want to listen again,
even though it isn’t initially appealing.
Gentle dream-like vocals over thick
synthesizers and hammering drums, a
quirky combination despite lack of real
instruments. -Luke Turner

I expected something exciting from
an electronic rock band consisting of
the recent addition to U.N.K.L.E and a
contributor to QOTSA frontman, Josh
Homme’s stoner-rock Desert Sessions.
But the result is bland, generic and in
no way exciting. The vocals are soul-
less, the music is flat, and to be hon-
est the songs are all extremely similar.
It quickly becomes apparent that File’s
new project shares the same flaws at-
tributed to U.N.K.L.E.’s last album. Co-
incidence? I think not. -Greg Power

where the line ‘clean my room and
dump my girlfriend’ warps into ‘gonna
burn my room and kill my girlfriend’.
Definitely puzzling and inarguably
intriguing.
It’s pretty much impossible to sum
up this guy. He’s written about 300
songs, his debut album is an 18 track
double album, split between songs
about pubescent desire (in all its im-
mature glory) and songs about abusive
fathers and drunken mothers. He’s al-
ready written his 2nd album, due for
release in 2010 and is working on the
3rd. He’s a prodigious talent, raw and
unrestricted in subject matter nor style
and he even has a bloody sea shanty
song about gay pirates who are made to
walk the plank for their ‘sins’. It’s freak-
ing fantastic but unfortunately not
on the album. Listen to this, his next
project is a short film about a man who
takes himself hostage. In short, my
head can’t deal with the reality of this
guy existing. – Kadhim Shubber
