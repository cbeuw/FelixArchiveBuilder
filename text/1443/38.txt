through the first half of the competi-
tion in a similar vein, winning all of
their matches and coming out tops.
After a lunch break which involved a
lot of impromptu napping, the Direct
Elimination (DE) rounds got under-
way. IC Epee crushed their quarter-
final opponents 45-16, then held firm
in their semi to win 45-34 and book a
place in the final against the LTFC 2nd
team.
The foilists had lost Colin for the
afternoon, but this didn’t stop them.
After emulating the epeeists in the
quarter-final (45-16), they reversed a
deficit to win their semi-final against
Wimbledon 43-37 and make sure both
Imperial College teams were in their
respective finals.
The epee final was a hard-fought
affair, the Italians and Gilhead nev-
er leading by more than a couple of
points.
With the score at 43-41 to Impe-
rial College with 15 seconds to go,
Colombino dropped two hits and the
score was tied at 43-a-piece at the end
of regular time.
A minute’s extra time followed, with
the first person to hit declared winner.
After a somewhat messy sequence, Co-
lombino’s opponent West managed to
score a remise, and it was all over.
A couple of pistes over, the foil final
between Imperial and ULU was in full
swing. Despite a poor initial bout from
the captain, losing 5-1, Gilhead and
Shaw produced some fine fencing to
catch up and overtake their opponents.
By the time the final bout came
round, it was just a question of wrap-
ping things up. Final score: 45-35
Two medals, some good fencing and
a whole lot of confidence : IC fencing’s
hopes are high for this season.
