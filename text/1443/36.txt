COFFEE BREAK
Morrow-scopes! Horoscopes, but now subsequent
Prepare for the ride of your life. Aquarius through to Capricorn. Strap yourself in. Not too tightly though
Cancer
His name is Bobby,
ooh ohh, Bobby de
Niro, aah aah, he’s a
lovely person, ooh ooh,
and a very good actor,
aah aah. But when he’s
not acting, it is said he is boring, but I do not
believe this, it is you who is boring. Fuck! people
have got to get some chat soon. If I hear “you
know you’re at Imperial when...” once more I’m
going to shove a kitten through a wood chipper.
Virgo
So you come home
one night and find
a girl passed out on
your bathroom floor.
Your moral conscience
plays havoc with you.
Her tights are already ripped, but then they do
smell. Wait a minute, is she dressed as a Michael
Jackson? This is far too confusing for you to deal
with; where’s the heroin? Can’t find a vein this
time, sonny? Those blue lights were your idea.
Gemini
You go to Tescos and
buy a sandwich. You
join a long and tedi-
ous queue for the self-
service check-outs.
You finally get your
till. You press ‘start’. You look for your barcode.
FUCK WHERE’S THE BARCODE!? Everyone is
staring at you and shaking their head. You never
find the barcode. That’s because it’s your penis
in your hand. Dirty pervert.
Pisces
Well, you touched
a little kid did you?
Fucking hell, first
anal beads, now
little kids? I was
wondering why you
bought a baby bottle and were cutting off the top
and replacing it with a condom. That’s fucking
disgusting but innovative. The Royal Engineering
Society decided they’ll give you their top prize for
innovative science this week.
Leo
You made the mistake
of asking Osama Bin
Laden how he made
his halloween costume
last week. Turns out it
wasn’t a costume. The
Taliban are out to get you, with bazookas and eve-
rything. They’re gonna catch up with you and cause
you and your family unfamiliar amounts of misery.
You’ll cry. Bin Laden doesn’t like crying. He gouges
out your eyeballs and uses them as his own.
Aries
So this guy picks me
up and takes a bite
out of me. Now I’m a
BLT, a pretty bitchin’
sandwhich if I might
say. I look into his
mouth where he’s contently chewing a mouthful
of me. Eugh! Close your gob you freak, fucking
brace-face, I’m going to throw up mayonaise all
over your shitty clothes. I hate being a library cafe
sandwhich, it’s full of horrible losers.
Scorpio
You spot a bear in the
garden, grab a gun and
shoot the bear. You call
to your son to say it’s safe
to come down. Another
bear roars down the
stairs and you blow it’s head off too. Suddenly bears
leap out of a police car, you shoot and shoot but
there are too many. They knock you down and ask
why you’re shooting everyone. You realise you’re a
bear, a fucking hot lady bear too. Kinky.
Libra
You brand your
new invention
BabyBlowJobs. You’ve
even got a website.
Well done you. You
take the BabyBlowJob
onto Dragon’s Den, and Theo Paphitis does
not like your invention one bit. “It’s just not
something I think my kids would enjoy. For that
reason, I’m out.” Deborah shows some vague
interest, but realises you’re just a disgusting c*nt.
Taurus
Hey Mr Engineer!
Enjoying your
mega cockfest ball?
Checking out the
talent I see. Don’t
even bother trying
to impress the only good looking girl with your
knowledge of fluid mechanics, she does Biology
you twat. That leaves you with the obvious dike
in the corner, go home now and have a group
wank with your bridge building wanker mates.
Capricorn
Thirty minutes till
the deadline! Need a
printer! All computers
are taken up by fuck-ups
playing WOW! Smack a
fuck-up! Get thrown out
of library! 15 minutes! Use girlfriend’s computer!
Girlfriend’s shagging best mate! Smack best mate!
Best mate is harder than you! Best mate fucks you
up! Deadline missed! Year failed! Smack small
child! Get arrested! Get gaoled! Life Over!!!!!! Pint?
Aquarius
Sodomy, necrophilia,
genital mutilation,
paedophilia, bestial-
ity - you’ve taken the
heights of sordidness
into the strato-
sphere. ‘Gratz mate you’ve been accepted into
the Guiness Book Of Records for ‘The most
twisted cunt in the world’. How about retiring
to the country now? Nah, your not finished, no
one’s fucked a mummified corpse yet...

I’m sorry but ultimate
frisbee is not a sport. I
mean, for fucks sake a
dog can play it! Please
stop spamming my
inbox with 20 shitty
emails a day, I don’t care if the ‘disk doctors’ are
having wicked party tonight with their crazy
drinking games. I only joined the mailing list
because I pitied you. Admit it, you want to wear a
skirt and play netball with the other girlies.
