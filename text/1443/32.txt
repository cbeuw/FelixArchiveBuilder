You’re probably quite bored of hear-
ing about the recession and how you’re
never going to get a job. Well the obvi-
ous answer to all of our financial prob-
lems is to start an empire. However,
this is not as easy as it sounds!
Before you hop on a plane and start
colonising China, you have to remem-
ber that it has sort of already been col-
onised. Stealing a country is a fine art
and Hangman is here to give you the
basics to global domination
STEP 1 - Before you run off on your
raping and plundering escapade, you
need permission from the Queen. Send
her a quick wall post on facebook, e.g
‘Heyyy Lizbo! Howz u? jst wndering
if u wer up 4 invadin France nxt week
LOL! wb xox’
If you receive a reply, she will probably
ask you to make a formal presentation
to a Dragon’s Den style panel consist-
ing of Helen Mirren, David Attenbor-
ough and Pat Sharp from Fun House. If
Pat gives you the executive nod - you’re
away!
So you’re cool, you’re politically correct...why not take over the world? It’s the next logical step

STEP 2 - You need a boat. None of this
modern, metal ‘Ooh look at me I’m so
shiny’ shit! You need a good old-fash-
ioned fuck-off Galleon! Arm it with
fuck-off cannons, fuck-off sails and a
tiny little fuck-off crow’s nest!
Give it an intimidating name, such as
‘Uber Pwnage’, ‘Harold Shipman’ or
‘Clive’. We’ve overlooked the British
tradition here of naming them after
our beloved wenches. That’s because
the only female name that you don’t
want storming towards you is the SS
Beth Ditto and that’s sadly already
been taken.
STEP 3 - Get a parrot and a ruff - Ruffs
are fucking amazing! Admittedly not
very piratey, but you’re a pirate with
class. A classy pirate with a fuck-off
ruff! That’s right you’re a fucking pirate
with a fuck-off ruff!
STEP 4 - Round up your crew. Lace
up your boots and kick down the door
of your local tavern. Make sure you’re
wearing your ruff at this point. The
common landlubbers will see your
fuck-off ruff and drool all over the
floor. They should sign up in a matter
of picoseconds.
STEP 5- You now have a crew and a
Galleon called Clive. The next step,
possibly the most important step, is
to ensure the safety of your ruff. Only
you, the Captain, are allowed to wear a
ruff and this may put strain on vessel-
relationships. If tension rises and you
fear a mutiny, allow them to stroke or
caress your ruff for a very short period
of time, under strict supervision. Make
sure they wear ruff-friendly gloves.
You may want to buy a safe for your
ruff.
STEP 6 - Invade France. This is like
a tutorial skirmish on any standard
real-time strategy game. Consider this

DISCLAIMER
a training exercise for your crew. It
should be a short battle, with no casu-
alties on your side. As soon as they
wave the white flag, plant your own on
top of the Eiffel Tower. This is the of-
ficial procedure for claiming France as
your own, as legislated in the Penguin
‘Pirates handbook 2009’. Congratula-
tions, you now own France. Although
it may seem exciting to have success-
fully captured a country, remember
that France is just the shit-stain on the
great white underpants that is Europe!
STEP 7 - Find India. You’ve heard
about it, but you don’t really know
where it is. The best methodical ap-
proach is to sail arbitrarily in any di-
rection and to name the first place you
land at as India.
Remember, it won’t be as easy as
France! Hangman’s tip is to sellotape
two cutlasses together and coil it with
multi-coloured christmas tree lights
until you’re wielding the deadliest
weapon man has seen. Them Indians
won’t know what’s hit them!
STEP 8 - The Slave Trade - Being a
leader isn’t easy. You should, by now,
have control of a great many countries
and their people. (Although you may

“Hangman is the biggest piece of poorly-
written shit I have ever read. How can
a newspaper, belonging to to one of
the world’s most respected universities,
allow such crass rubbish?” Hangman
have called them all India) The final
step is how to keep your people happy
and make some money in the process.
The slave trade has been out of fashion
for some time now, mainly due to the
recession, but with your new empire
you have the chance to provide jobs,
and affordable slaves, en masse.
Congratulations. You now have suc-
cessful control of an Empire, a flour-
ishing slave trade and a ruff! Easy.
PAT NODS!
