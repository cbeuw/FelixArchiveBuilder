Orange with
rage
O
range incurred the wrath
of the UK tech establish-
ment this week with their
announcement of their
upcoming iPhone price plans. Being
a whole 36p cheaper over a 24 month
plan, Orange isn’t really going to ignite
a price war with O2, instead they’ll
likely rely on their better coverage and
3G bandwidth to win people over. Ok,
fine, no price war like we all wanted,
but I can’t say I’m suprised. What I,
and a load of the UK tech press were
suprised at is the absolute abuse of
the word ‘Unlimited’ by Orange. Un-
limited, well you know what it means,
but unfortunately Orange obviously
doesn’t. Contained within their ‘fair’
use policy there’s a stipulation that
the bandwidth cap is actually 750MB.
I don’t know about you but when I
buy an Unlimited plan, I expect to get
unlimited service, not some meagre
download limit. Now, Orange claim
that the average iPhone user doesn’t
use more than 200MB a month and
so 750MB is more than enough. Prob-
lem is, I doubt they base that figure on
actual iPhone usage figures. 200MB
per month may well be accurate for
much less data-centric devices but
for the iPhone, that’s a rather poultry
amount. Considering that the iPhone
boasts streaming music apps, access to
YouTube, BBC iPlayer and fully fledged
web browsing, even their supposed
plentiful cap of 750MB is small fry.
To make matters worse, a quick
look in Orange’s Terms and Condi-
tions shows that they prohibit the use
of streaming apps such as Spotify and
social networking sites such as Face-
book. Now I don’t know about you but
what’s the good of an iPhone that you
can’t use the Apps that make it what it
is? Now don’t get me wrong, I under-
stand that Orange need some sort of
fair use policy to protect their network
from abuse, but limiting the device by
blocking what it’s naturally geared up
to do is ludicrous.
More Apple news this week in the
form of a supposed iPhone 4th gen-
eration part leak. China Ontrade, an
electronics wholesaler, claims that it
has leaked shots of the next-generation
iPhone midboard (the bit that every-
thing screws into inside the phone).
Ok, so it’s not a spy shot, or anything
that indicates a radical redesign, and
it’s literally 8 months early from Apple’s
usual device generational turn-over.
But last time China Ontrade ousted a
supposed iPhone part they were dead
on and one month later the iPhone
3GS appeared. Does this mean that
Apple’s going to break with it’s yearly
refresh cycle and release a new iPhone
model in the next few months? With
my contract up for renewal in January
next year I hope so, but I wouldn’t get
your hopes up. Apple’s highly unlikely
to do such a thing, but never say never.
Twitter has unleashed lists to the
general twitter populous this week
enabling people to set up, maintain
and follow lists of people and their
tweets. It gives you the convenience of
mass follows and means that you can
follow people’s tweets without follow-
ing them directly. If you’re not a twit-
ter user this probably means nothing
to you, but Lists have become the new
follower count with people competing
to be on as many lists as possible.
Talking of Twitter, how about a mo-
bile device that does nothing but ac-
cess and post to Twitter? Well that’s all
the TwitterPeek does. For the princely
some of $200 without a monthly fee,
you can access Twitter from anywhere.
Hmm, I’ll stick with my iPhone thanks.

Weekly Wrap Up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
After the buzz of Android 2.0 last
week, this week’s news has been a lit-
tle more unconventional than most.
For starters the Rise of the Machines
steadily ploughs on. We’ve got MIT re-
searchers working on a program called
ClearView that will create ‘immortal
and invulnerable’ programs. In simple
terms, it automatically patches pro-
grams that experience errors or vul-
nerabilities. Great idea to stop hackers
and viruses from causing havok but
think about this: A computer program
that can heal itself and can’t be dam-
aged by humans. Skynet anyone?
Lockheed Martin have been in
the news this week too with another
deathbot. Their next generation UAV
the Sabre Warrior Drone, which looks
like a cross between something out
of Batman and Star Wars, is a 46 foot
long killing machine. With a wingspan
of some 36 feet and 22,000 pounds of
thrust it can handle 2000 pounds of or-
dinance to destroy any puny building
you might be hiding in.
Skynet can give as well as take away.
The latest bomb sniffing robot takes
the form of an unmanned helicoptor
codenamed Yellow Jacket. This little
beauty is tasked with the unenviable
job of searching out for IEDs and road-
side bombs by detecting and locating
their electromagnetic emissions. Trav-
elling by road is currently one of the
most dangerous activities in Afghani-
stan due to the roadside bombs. If Yel-
low Jacket can give soldiers a scanned
clear path, then I’m all for it.
An autonomous Audi TTS also made
an appearance this week. Built by Stan-
dord to compete in the Pikes Peak In-
ternational Hill Climb, a race that takes
its competitors over 20Km, through
156 turns and up a 1423m climb on
gravel and paved roads, the TTS is
packed full of GPS, sensors and a com-
plicated guidance system. It will be an
impressive feet to see the car navigate
all the twisty turns and reach the fin-
ish line and would make Darpa’s Urban
Challenge look a little like childs play.
In entertainment news, the BBC this
week announced that it’s iPlayer VOD
service is coming to FreeSat starting
this month in a closed beta. It’s good
news for all those with FreeSat boxes
and if it’s successful, will probably
mark a move to integrate the service
with FreeView HD boxes later in 2010.
All currently available FreeSat+ boxes
are capable of receiving iPlayer with a
software update thanks to in-built eth-
ernet ports, which were made manda-
tory at the beginning of the FreeSat+
specification.
The Beetles continue their extremely
laboured migration to digital distri-
bution. Having made it onto Beetles
RockBand and with re-mastered and
original CDs already available, the Bee-
tles have now made available their 14
stereo tracks on an Apple shaped USB
flash drive. The odd looking thing car-
Cloud storage is all the rage these
days, with connection speeds steadily
increasing and online storage ever de-
creasing in cost. One day it’s likely that
most of our data will be stored in the
cloud in one form or another. We’ve
been accessing our email for decades
via webmail interfaces like Hotmail,
Yahoo! mail and Gmail before it was
described as ‘the cloud’ and services
like Xmarks use server storage for
cloud based sync. So it shouldn’t come
as a shock to you that many companies
offer storage solutions, some better
than others, quite a lot for the very stu-
dent friendly price of free.
Dropbox is one of the better online
storage and file sync solutions avail-
able at the moment. Its service is built
around a very simple idea, sync a folder
full of files between any computer you
happen to use and online.
The service itself consists of a client
that runs as a service on your compu-
ter, syncing any files that are contained
within a ‘Dropbox’ folder on your
computer. The location of that folder
can be user determined but anything
within that folder is automatically
transferred to your own personal piece
of cloud storage provided by Dropbox.
Once the file is uploaded it can then
be downloaded onto any computer
whether it’s a PC, a Mac or even Linux
that you set up sync with, seamlessly
and in the background. If you need ac-
cess to that file on the road your entire
Dropbox can be accessed via a browser
on the Dropbox website or even via a
free iPhone app.
Dropbox’s simple solution essentially
provides three services in one. First off
you’ve got file sync, which means you
can easily transfer files between com-
puters as long as you have an internet
connection. You’ve also got access to
those files where ever you happen to
be via a browser, including your mo-
bile devices, allowing you to keep your
files with you even on other people’s
computers. The third attribute Drop-
box provides might be something you
wouldn’t immediately think about,
backup. Dropbox syncs all your files
in your Dropbox to the cloud mean-
ing you’ve always got a copy of the files
stored online, but you’ve also got a
copy of those files synced to any com-
puter you happen to have set up. In to-
tal this means that not only have you
got online backup but you’ve got mul-
tiple local backups too. So should your
laptop get pinched, your house burn
down, or an act of god swallows Impe-
rial up in a freak Earthquake, you’ll at
least have one or more of those back-
ups available to you.
Dropbox also has one more trick
up it’s sleeve that sets it apart from
the rest of the cloud storage pack and
that’s a public folder within your Drop-
box. Here you can place files you’d like
to share with other people and with a
simple right click you’ve got a share-
able link that you can send to whoever
you want to be able to download that
file. If they’ve got a Dropbox them-
selves and their on your local network
the software is smart enough to route
the file transfer via the local network
meaning that you get great connection
speeds for anyone who’s local to you.
Dropbox has both free and subscrip-
tion services. The free service starts off
at 2GB of storage space, with no nags
or any other annoyances. Should you
need more storage you can buy 50GB
of storage for $9.99 a month (about £6
in todays money) or a whole 100GB for
$19.99 (£12) a month.
You can even top up your 2GB of free
space to a maximum of 3GB by getting
your friends to sign up via referrals in
250MB chunks.
So if you’re looking for a service that
you can use from anywhere with an
internet connection, to both store and
sync your files safely and securely, even
within college, then check out Drop-
box at www.getdropbox.com and
grab some fantastic, free storage that
simply works.

and MP3 formats and is equipped with
a custom made Flash player and a load
of extra video and photo related art-
work. Great for collectors I suppose
but for those who just want to buy the
Beetles music from their favourite dig-
ital download store, still no luck.
Nvidia confirmed this week that Intel
won’t be supporting USB3 until 2011
with its chipsets. This senseless delay
will mean that USB3 probably won’t hit
off till late 2011. LightPeak anyone?
