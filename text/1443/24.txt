felix FRIDAY 6 NOVEMBER 2009
Eurosceptic
I
managed to make it to the Eu-
rogamer Expo last weekend, and
jolly good it was too. I didn’t go
last year, but I was given a tour
by felix stalwart and sexy gen-
tleman Tomo Roberts; stalking mem-
bers of the games industry, mistaking
every game in the exhibition for Mass
Effect 2, and generally breaking eve-
rything we touched. What did we get
our hands on? Well, lots of things, but
I honestly couldn’t tell you anything
more from the three or four minutes I
got with each that you wouldn’t be able
to garner from YouTube. Mass Effect
2 - very similar to Mass Effect 1. Left-
4Dead2 - pretty fun, I guess. Dragon
Age - bewildering, but Mr. Roberts
spent half an hour glued to it so I can
only assume that’s good too.
This is the problem with exhibi-
tions like this – they don’t tell you an
awful lot. That’s why they frequently
become more about the periphery,
about seeing all the other stuff around
it. Valve’s Chet Faliszek was around
the Left4Dead2 stand chatting to gam-
ers. People from nVidia were trying
to convince gamers to spend £350 on
making their monitors wobble a bit in
3D, and of course the Developer Ses-
sions, where developers talked about
their games. Among the high-profile
talks that your fearless correspondent
missed entirely included Splash Dam-
age, who demonstrated their new FPS
Brink, and nVidia who were further
trying to impress people with silly
glasses and layered Batmen.
However, I did manage to claw back
some journalistic respectability by at-
tending David Cage’s talk on Heavy
Rain, his new game coming to the PS3
soon. It’s supposed to genuinely tell a
story, in much the same way that his
earlier work Fahrenheit aimed to. He
was very frank in admitting mistakes
he had made in Fahrenheit (“I need to
make the story last for more than two
thirds of the game...”) but also adamant
that it was an important stepping stone
in his path to narrative-driven gaming.
He’s an enormously interesting man,
and Heavy Rain is a fascinating game.
It’s quite clear from the short demo he
gave that it’s not all it’s cracked up to
be – the complex, looping gameplay
showed an audio repeat or two, and
it’s not like you can do whatever you
want. But he also made some great
points. When asked whether he was
trying to encourage people to play the
game many times to see everything,
he replied, “Actually, I’d kinda like it if
they played the game just once. Because
life’s a bit like that, you don’t get to see
everything.”
Cage later defended his attempt to con-
vey love, sadness and depression through
his games, saying that Hollywood was not
all action and comedy movies.
It’s exciting stuff. If only I had a PlaySta-
tion 3. Look out for Heavy Rain when it
comes out next year, and enjoy this issue.

Ten Long Years - 2003
W
ow. So we lost half
our column space,
huh? I guess news
is more important
or some bullshit.
Anyway, let’s not dwell and instead
move swiftly on through the decade.
2003! Games! Andrew, quickly, tell us
about Knights of the Old Republic!
“Loved this game. Still do. Very ac-
cessible RPG, and I think the first one
I really got into (all those AD&D ones
passed me by, shamefully). The fact
that it was all fully voiced (though
with a bit of a cheat due to the sheer
number of aliens in the game) layered
the polish on to a very solid game with
an intriguing storyline.”
Hmm. Okay. That sounded pretty
sane though, anyone want to go a bit
crazy for me? Hent?
“The first Bioware game that didn’t
actively penalise you for being evil, so
naturally I was all over that. It started out
kind of limp with petty extortion and the
like, but soon ramped up to slave trading
and dicing an insane guy into kibbles as
he hid inside a storage locker”
Excellent. This was a pretty good year
all-round for being evil, what
with Republic and Deus
Ex: Invisible War being
released. Although both
weren’t treated with such
high regard as KotOR:
“Invisible War is a bad
game because it’s central
premise – the idea of
providing the player
with a choice of how
to complete an ob-
Thespaceissmaller,butthegamesarestillgood.Nextyear,hooo!
jective – is woefully implemented. No
matter how much you piss off any of the
factions, they will still come back cap in
hand asking you to kindly go and mur-
der someone or blow up something or
steal something-or-other. So you never
feel like you’re fighting for one particu-
lar faction or like you’re part of a partic-
ular cause or ideology, you just feel like
an uninterested freelancer. This and the
story was bollocks.”
Away from the shop shelves, big things
happened. Valve released Steam, the
successor to their WON service, now the
behemoth digital distribution service on
the PC platform.
Soul Calibur 2 hit many platforms this
year, an important game in the beat ‘em
up genre, providing a contrast to the
Tekken-alikes that were becoming more
and more popular.
“SC2 was the only beat ‘em up I ever
playedthatfeltsatisfy-
ing to master. The
fighting styles it
offered blend-
ed in the way
that they should, animated themselves in
a way that made sense visually. It made
you feel powerful.”
The Gamecube also picked up another
landmark this year, with Wind Waker’s
release finally bringing Zelda into the
latest console generation. The new visual
style was stunning, even if the departure
from Ocarina was difficult for some
players to accept.
“Wind Waker wasn’t a game that im-
mediately grabbed you. It took some
time to get into, it didn’t fire up enthu-
siasm from the start. But it was still a
fantastic game. The music, the feeling of
open space, was unlike anything GC had
seen before.”
It was a good year for sequels, too,
with Homeworld 2, Jak 2 and Max Payne
2 all making their way to gamers in the
second half of the year. But the real gem
lurking in the list of Christmas releases is
the unassuming Beyond Good And Evil,
the journalistic platformer that everyone
keeps meaning to play.
“BG&E was such a gorgeous game.
Every bit of that world was just right,
and all the gameplay tricks just added
more and more to the characteri-
sation – photographing an-
imals for biological
catalogues, invent-
ing stuff for Pey’j to
use. It was all amaz-
ing, and it’s a shame it
probably won’t see a
sequel.
Next year - Half-Life
2, World of Warcraft
and Rome: Total War.
Enough said.
