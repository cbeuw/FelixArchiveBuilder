This being a science college, I’m
sure most of us are familiar with
the story of The Hitchhiker’s Guide
to the Galaxy. Unfortunately, this
is not it.
Previous incarnations of the
Guide include successful radio and
TV series and a trilogy of five popu-
lar books that define that ‘sci-fi-com-
edy-adventure’ genre. Whilst it is
not unusual for the stories to differ
between media, the latest film star-
ring Martin Freeman as the hapless
earthman Arthur Dent takes this
idea to a new level.
As with all versions, the film
begins with the now classic juxtapo-
sition of Dent’s irritation when his
house is bulldozed one morning in
the name of transport improvement
with his disbelief when his planet
meets a similar fate later that after-
noon at the hands of the Vogons.
Having hitched a lift on a spaceship,
a strange journey throughout the
galaxy ensues, punctuated various-
ly by encounters with a depressed
robot, a two-headed galactic presi-
dent and some hyper-intelligent
mice with only a towel for protec-
tion. As Arthur puts it, “This must
be Thursday. I never could get the
hang of Thursdays.”
Alongside all this, we learn about
the indispensable electronic refer-
ence book, the The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy, which guides
us through all that tricky alien inter-
action stuff.
Sounds like the story we all know
and love, doesn’t it? Think again.
‘Love’ is the key word here, as unfor-
tunately vast swathes of humour
have been replaced by a dull love
story, as scenes of Arthur rescuing
a inappropriately American Tricia
McMillan (Zooey Deschanel) are
thrown in, purely for Hollywood
effect. The books are well known
for their cynical British humour, but
none of the characteristic pessimism
so beautifully portrayed by Simon
Jones in the Radio and TV series
comes through, despite Freeman’s
best attempts. (Jones, incidentally,
makes a brief cameo for the fans.)
Both Ford (Mos Def) and Zaphod
(Sam Rockwell) sport uncharacter-
istic American accents that sim-
ply don’t suit the dialogue. A poor
attempt at incorporating Zaphod’s
extra head even inspires fondness
for the technologically devoid TV
series.
Fortunately, there are one or
two saving graces that prevent a
fan from leaving halfway through.
Stephen Fry’s efforts at following
on from the legendary Peter Jones
are pleasing, coupled with the enter-
taining animations the book pro-
duces to explain parts of the film.
Alan Rickman’s portrayal of Marvin,
the paranoid android, was effective,
and the improvements in compu-
ter graphics did wonders for his
range of expression. Bill Nighy also
makes a reasonable interpretation
of Slartibartfast.
Aside from a few positive add-ins,
this film was generally a disappoint-
ment. At 110 minutes, there shouldn’t
have been a need to cut out such
large portions of good material from
the originals, and it all leads to a film
that will appear even more stilted
and bizarre to those who haven’t
read the books. Particularly sorely
missed were the ‘Restaurant at the
End of the Universe’ scene and the
‘proof’ that God doesn’t exist. In
general, highlights were few and far-
between, so only go if you already
know where your towel is, and be
prepared for the worst. If you’ve
never heard of it, don’t bother: it’s
a confusing, Hollywood-ised, feeble
imitation of the original.

R2D2 has competition in the world of robotic cinema stars
As if this movie needs any more hype!
Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of
the Sith, the most eagerly awaited
film of the summer, has a lot to live
up to.
The creative genius of George
Lucas might have started out with a
deceptively simple story of a smug-
gler and a farm boy out to save
a princess. However, it has since
developed into a rich tale of love,
magic, scandal that ultimately leads
to the destruction and then con-
struction of a new world order.
In Episodes I and II, we have
witnessed how Anakin Skywalker
(Hayden Christensen) was rescued
from slavery in Tatooine to become
the delicious, headstrong and tal-
ented young Jedi that he is today.
However, followers of the ‘Force’
will know from Episodes IV, V and
VI that Anakin will turn into the
much-feared villain Darth Vader.
Therefore, Episode III will serve
as the missing link in the Star Wars
series.
Every drop of adulation we ever
had for the young Jedi will be
crushed as we witness his transfor-
mation from a pure and good-looking
young man into an asthmatic-sound-
ing, evil metal-suited Darth Vader.
Nevertheless, we have to hope that
Hayden Christensen’s rigid acting
skills have since improved with age,
as this flaw was one of the major
disappointments in Episode II.
In Episode II, we witnessed how
the Republic achieved victory
against the Separatists. As Yoda had
wisely mentioned, it was not a true
victory because it had strengthened
Supreme Chancellor Palpatine’s
(Ian McDiarmid) influence in the
Republic. Viewers will marvel at the
revelation of Palpatine’s true nature
underneath his frail, soft-spoken
mask to become Darth Sidius, the
lord of the Sith (an ancient order
devoted to the dark side).
Through Episode III, the whole
Republic as we know it will be con-
sumed by the dark side, leading to
the destruction of the democratic
state and the downfall of the Jedi
Order. Hopefully, Ian McDiarmid’s
acting skills will be up to scratch to
convince viewers that he is Emperor
Palpatine, the tyrant who ruled with
an iron fist.
Star Wars II ended with a cliff-
hanger, Senator Amidala’s secret
betrothal to Anakin Skywalker.
We might have had to endure the
painstakingly long relationship
development in Episode II, but the
sadists inside us will enjoy watch-
ing their marriage tear itself apart
in Episode III. Viewers will also
finally meet Luke Skywalker and
Princess Leia for the first time, and
this will seal the link of Episodes I
and II with Episodes IV, V and VI.
Something else to watch out for is
the increase in wisdom and power
of Obi-Wan Kenobi from a young,
foolish Padawan to perhaps one of
the strongest Jedis, with powers
comparable to those of the chosen
one.
As expected, judging from the the-
atrical trailer, the visual and sound
effects behind Star Wars: Episode III
– Revenge of the Sith, will be stellar
as usual. However, the acting skills
and the way the story is narrated
will be more crucial in impressing
today’s CGI-jaded crowd. Star Wars
is a milestone in cinematic science
fiction and is integral to the cultural
development of the 20th and 21st
centuries. Therefore, to cut to the
chase, do not miss it.
