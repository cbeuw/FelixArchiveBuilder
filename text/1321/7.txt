La la la la la,
The summer has finally arrived
– it’s officially too warm not to wear a
skirt. The intrepid Stormy has been
out and about, sizing up the best
styles around to display her perfectly
tanned, hairless pins. She hasn’t had
to worry about much else, since legs
or no legs, Stormy hasn’t been short
of attention for the past week or so,
the majority of it being unwanted.
Take the hapless geriatric Arab
(hello, is it ever anyone else?) illegal
immigrant who tried to make a pass
at me on the bus last week. Eight
thirty am is just not the time to try it
on, especially if you have no chance
in hell of getting anywhere.
The conversation went a little like
this, whilst I had my headphones in
listening to Hot Fuss, my favourite
album of the last year, for the ten
millionth time. He disturbed me in
the middle of my favourite song, the
wonderful Somebody Told Me.
“You vote next week?”
“Yeah.”
“You vote immigration policy?”
“I don’t know.”
Cue puzzlement.
“I vote you be mine”.
Cue disgust. I replace my head-
phones and turn to face the window.
Resistant and persistent, his per-
viness continues, after tapping me
repeatedly on the shoulder.
“I like music.”
“Cool.”
“I listen your music?”
“No, you can’t, the bacteria in your
auditory canal will ruin my music.”
Thankfully, the bus pulled into
a stop within running distance of
College. Off I got, flustered and
annoyed, and ran the fastest 1500
metres possible in three inch heels.
Three inch heels?
Yes, I’ve taken to joining the rest
of the vertically challenged skinny
sluts in College since it’s project
handover week, meaning I’ve got
presentations galore. Imagine my
glee on walking, all-prettied up, into
a room full of coffee, biscuits and
flirty Brazilian waiters. Tasty stuff.
Alas, that’s as good as it got. My
presentationwentdismally,consider-
ing it turned out to be an impromptu
discussion of my inappropriate cou-
ture footwear and a complete dis-
missal of my vital research into the
mouse tissue factor gene. I mean,
animal rights aren’t part of a BSc
project discussion, are they? Stupid
veganmohairwomanwithhermousy
hair and oversized Birkenstocks.
She’s evidently jealous that she can’t
afford Jimmy Choos. Don’t touch
what you can’t afford, sister!
I walked off in a huff, ready to
break down in tears, when the Ethan
Spears-lookalike I’d had a brief tryst
in the Huxley with arrived with hugs
and chocolate. He’d heard I was in
the building and knew things hadn’t
gone well. He asked me out to coffee,
and I obliged.
It’s the least I could have done – if
I’d not got in there, somebody else
would have. And that, my dear read-
ers, after his Thai soap massages, is
not something I’d have like to have
happened!
So did Stormy get lucky or didn’t
she? Let’s just say the cat got the
cream. I’ll see you next week.
The girl about town
by STORMY WOODS
So, a new term, and maybe even a
new Britain. Today, the great and
the good of the country will come
together to make us all a new future.
Or alternatively, what will actually
happen: the lazy people will have
the greatest say.
Nothing will change. Despite years
of bitching and complaining about
how this country sucks, no-one will
get off their arse for long enough to
make a difference. And because of
the electoral system of this coun-
try being as mad as a badger, the
Government will once again be left
with a majority of 40,000 seats in
the House of Commons, and will
be able to plough ahead and knock
down the House of Lords to make
way for a bowling alley. This will
be despite only have gained just
11.3% of the vote, with most seats
coming from recent ‘restructuring’
in constituency boundaries. Only in
the UK and its parent country, the
USA, can such blatant vote tamper-
ing happen.
But I’m not one to whine about
things, so I’m going to look on the
positive side. It is only when poli-
ticians feel comfortable in their
posts do they do something use-
ful, so I reckon the next general
election should not be called until
2012, in order to really muck up the
Olympics.
All joking aside, use some of the
energy you’ve saved up for porn to
tick a small box and make a small
child happy.
The real world
Time flies when you’re having fun,
and even more so when that fun
is actually university. One minute
you’re this fresh-faced youth with
time on his side and an intriguing
take on the world, the next you are
a grubby, bearded ‘man’ of indeter-
minate age with an intriguing take
on the concept of hygiene. What
happened to the intervening years?
Were there really that many kebabs?
Really that few women?
Sadly yes, but even more sad-
dening is the concept of finals.
Fortunately it’s only my housemate
Seb who is doing these things, and
being biology they shouldn’t really
pose too much of a problem. Now,
whilst I like Seb, I truly fear for the
future, for what is left of my life if
even my housemates are having to
become part of the real world?
I can’t believe how cruel life is. I
was just getting into Neighbours and
Hollyoaks, No Angels and Casualty,
Doctors and Murder She Wrote; and
then those buggers come along and
expect me to remember some silly
lecture from my first year, about
enzymes. Or was it hormones?
Whatever, I doubt I’ll ever need it
again... especially as exam avoid-
ance has allowed me to fulfil my
lifelong (well since Eastenders last
night) ambition to become a quali-
fied tap dancer.
Toilet seats
Seriously, why is leaving the toilet
seat up such a big issue? It’s not like
people are small enough to actu-
ally fall into the bowl. How many
people have actually drowned in the
toilet? Whilst trying to piss? It’s not
exactly rocket science. Plus girls
aren’t like blokes, and so generally
turn the light on whilst using the
bathroom. No such luxury for us,
especially if the floor is tiled. It’s all
about efficiency, and possibly beat-
ing the house record time, whilst
still maintaining an air of dignity.
Well, maybe without the dignity, and
possibly with a lot more muffled
swear words as you kick the bath for
the twentieth time that week.
Personally I think this is the
clincher: women never put the seat
back up when they’re done, even if
a man has carefully left it up for his
next visit. It’s only fair to leave it as
you found it, surely? Having cleaned
up for us of course.
Science
Scientists have recently worked out
the main driving factor behind all
scientific discoveries. As, histori-
cally at least, most scientists have
been men, it’s surprising it hadn’t
come to the fore earlier. The engine
of learning is sex. From Newton
(equations for dangling breasts, now
used heavily by bra manufacturers
andcosmeticsurgeonseverywhere),
to Einstein (equations describing
how time slows down when a par-
ticularly attractive woman becomes
naked), sex has driven men to
develop new and intriguing ways of
enjoying it.
The most recent example is of
course the internet, or the ‘web of
porn’ as it was originally called. Its
amazing how quickly broadband has
been picked up. Strictly for email of
course, which gets there quicker
if you have a dedicated 8Mbps line
linked into the Vivid Videos film site.
Honest.
But on a serious note, space travel
and exploration has taken a back
seat since the Americans went to
the moon and confirmed it was like
Monday lunch in the local pub – a
complete lack of hot ladies. So my
idea to rejuvenate NASA and their
ilk is to restart the programme
that brain-washes scientists into
thinking that their is intelligent life
elsewhere that just happens to be
shaped like a centrefold. You might
have heard of it, it’s called Star
Trek. There’s always hope when
aliens have to be told about this
thing called love...
Electioneering
by TRISTAN LANE
So hello all you Imperial people! I
am sure there are people out there
who already think they know some-
thing about me from that sentence.
You see, I was lying on my bed
the other night and it was seriously
dark. I couldn’t tell between opening
and closing my eyes. Without any
parents, any friends, any mirrors,
any writing on the walls, any visible
society or anything except my own
meandering mind, I wondered what
there really is of me. OK, so I had
my mind, and the wonderful concept
that I am thinking and therefore I
must exist. Though I don’t really see
how that proves anything. I mean
this is it, really – the stripped down
version of ourselves that everything
around us, including our faces, seem
to decorate.
So I was meant to introduce
myself, but I couldn’t think of a
way of fundamentally identifying
myself without creating a reflection
of something or someone else in the
world outside.
I hate being asked where I am
‘originally’ from. I find the whole
idea pretty hilarious. I mean, how
original do they want to get? I stu-
pidly tell them, “from this world”
(no, not even a distinction between
the first and the third), only for them
to stare at me pretty blankly until I
just want to end their misery.
What would a country say about
me? Each country is just as diverse
as the landscape of our being. It
would give clues about the empires
that flourished and demised with
time, the arbitrary political strug-
gles that lead to men in traditional
clothes drawing maps and lines to
signify the borders dividing the new
generations, only to change over
and over again throughout history.
How European will the Turks feel
as soon the Brussels team are ready
for them to join? How Pakistani did
the Pakistanis feel two generations
ago? At least it leads to Imperial
boasting about more and more clubs
and societies, I guess.
I am really glad that I have been
‘accused’ of ‘trying’ to be black,
white and probably all the pretty col-
ours in the rainbow, while ultimately
amusing myself in the knowledge
that I wasn’t ‘trying’ anything and
was just being myself. And all along,
how much those people misinter-
preted me, wasting their breath,
thinking that I would be insulted by
saying I was pretty damn universal!
Oh yes, the age old psychological
insight that tells us that we should
feel insecure if we cannot provide
a label for ourselves. How about
striving to find security within our-
selves without the labels and the
whole façade? Fortunately, no single
country, no single religion, no single
way of life can sum it up for me. A
blank canvas leaves me far more to
play with!
Who am I?
