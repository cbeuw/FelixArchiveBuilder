COLUMNS felix@ic.ac.uk
I promise I’m not going to mention
Neighbours in every single column.
But has it not been particularly fan-
tastic recently – the fire, the return
of bad boy Paul Robinson (son of
Jim Robinson, aka Caleb in The
OC)...
Neighbours have upped the stakes
because this is the 20th anniversary
year. Watch out for the 20th anni-
versary episode, to be screened in
October, in which many famous
ex-neighbours are rumoured to be
returning, including Billy Kennedy,
Flick Scully, Paul McClain, Lance
Wilkinson and Amy Greenwood.
Unfortunately Kylie has declined,
as has Jason Donovan because he
has “other pressing commitments”.
Yeah right mate, your career is real-
ly taking off, isn’t it?!
Also, don’t miss Dr Karl’s band,
who are currently touring the UK!
He’s playing Royal Holloway Union
on 3 June – I’ve already got tick-
ets. But why isn’t he coming here?
More to the point, why does nobody
ever play at our Union? Response
required, Mr President.
4th floor library dude
Have any of you noticed that there
is certain vest-wearing tall guy
who must spend his whole life on
the fourth floor of the library? As
research for this column, I’ve been
spot-checking for his presence at
random hours of the day and night.
He is always there.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not hav-
ing a dig at conscientious hard-
working people, but this guy is a
joke. He never does any work, just
sits at the computer and acts the
‘big man’ chatting to his mates. OK,
the fourth floor is the group study
area, so people should be aloud to
chat. But, so loudly and with his
penetrating baritone? Please shut
up.
A couple of my mates reckon he
stalks them around the library. They
eyeball him on the fourth floor, head
down to the second, but then low
and behold he turns up downstairs
a few minutes later.
I’ve once seen him really agitat-
ed, I think he was worried that
as none of his mates were around
he might actually have to do some
work instead of pretending to. But
he was on the case: he got out his
phone and texted his friends so that
they could have a little party in the
library!
While on the subject of the library,
should it really be open 24 hours?
People live in the library, which is
just plain wrong, not just for their
sanity, but also our nasal passages.
‘24 hour stinters’ don’t appear to
go home and wash, and I’ve seen
some people brushing their teeth in
the toilets. I mean that’s just plain
wrong!
The Neighbours generation
by RUPERT NEATE
There are moments when you want
to die, there are moments when
you want to cry, there are moments
when you scream for help… and
then there are Imperial College
exams!
By now you are either revising
for an exam, taking an exam (and
probably failing it, as you should be
reading the exam paper, not this!)
or you’ve just finished an exam (and
instead of partying like there is no
tomorrow, you’re reading Felix!
What an exciting life, huh?)
In our academic lives, we all have
to face exam time, whether we like it
or not. (And if you like it, I wrote an
article about you last week.)
So today, I’m going to concentrate
on these two questions:
1. What kind of personalities can we
spot in exams?
2. How can you make it through an
exam?
1. What kind of personalities
can we spot in exams?
• When you are in an exam class-
room, you can smell it in the air...
no, not the tension, but the sweat of
the students who haven’t showered
for three days just to catch up with
all the theory! These are the exami-
nators: studying machines brought
back from the future with only one
goal, to get at least 90% in all the
subjects! Virtually impossible, you
may think... but not for them! Even
if they are attracting male giraffes
that confuse their odour with that
of females in mating season, they
won’t be distracted from their goal!
• On the completely opposite side
are the cheaters! For them, cheat-
ing is not a solution, it’s a way of
life. They can’t really be bothered
to do any work, and so they spend
the whole time trying to figure out
totally new and efficient cheating
styles. I could write a whole article
about them, but I’m going to let that
opportunity go.
• You can usually find a couple of
sleepers. They slept through all the
lectures, they slept through all the
revision period, they slept the last
time they tried to have a sexual
relationship and they sleep through
their exams. Like a mutation from
human to koala, they hibernate for
the whole year, only opening their
eyes to grab some bamboo or euca-
lyptus.
• The fourth type usually goes unno-
ticed. Silent but deadly, like nin-
jas, they release a gas bomb that
will disturb half of the class, get
another third killed by intoxication
and leave only the examinators still
hard at work. They are at the brink
of extinction, but there is a discreet
farters’ resistance trying to rise
from the ashes.
• Finally, we have the normal stu-
dents (like you and me), who spend
the year partying and then go mental
at exam time, trying to revise every-
thing in one week. They usually end
up doing well in the exams, but that
doesn’t stop them from almost hav-
ing a cardiac arrest on each exam’s
eve and browning their pants when
they receive the exam paper.
2. How can you make it
through an exam?
This part of the article is written for
‘normal students’ only. So, if you’re
not one, please just re-read Stormy
Woods’ column instead. (I would like
to use this public space to say that I
am really going to miss my column-
ist partner when she graduates! I
reckon on your ‘loving’ odyssey you
haven’t tasted a Latin social ana-
lyser so, Stormy, whoever you are,
if you want to improve your CV, just
email me – and I know from last
week that you’re waiting to add a
Latin lover to your collection!)
Anyway, making it through an
exam... I’m not the best person to
do this (in fact, I’m probably the one
who needs professional advice), but
I’ll try to do my best.
• Try to sleep before your exam.
Don’t spend the night watching porn
or thinking about how much you’re
going to have to study for the resits.
• Stop getting drunk every other
night and start drinking stuff that
wont interfere directly with your
DNA.
• Unless you are a ‘silent but deadly’
type, avoid beans and curries.
• Try to revise every day, and not
only on the way to the exam (I’ve
seen loads of late revisers crashing
into trees in Hyde Park doing that).
• Write notes while you’re studying.
It helps you understand what you’re
reading and makes you look smart
enough to the girls in your depart-
ment (if you have any).
• Never, but never, hang around
with walking encyclopaedias! They’ll
make you feel like the dumbest guy
in the world and you’ll want to finish
all the pain with a quick jump into
the Thames! Ignorance is bliss...
• Finally... take it easy! It’s hard,
but not impossible! And think of
all the girls/guys you are going to
find in that tropical country where
you’ll be spending your holidays
(if you’re from a tropical country
already, think about all those fit tour-
ists loaded with money!)
