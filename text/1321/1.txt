Last orders for Southside Bar
By Dave Edwards
Editor
This year’s Imperial College
Union Summer Ball will be
held on the South Kensington
campus on Saturday 18 June
2005. Over £34,000 of funding
has been secured from the
College and corporate spon-
sors. Tickets will be on sale
from Monday and, according
to the organisers, “it looks set
to be a great event”.
Music at the ball will be pro-
vided by Radio 1 DJs Trevor
Nelson and Colin Murray,
amongst others. Indoor
entertainment, including jazz
music and a casino, will con-
tinue through the night until
the survivors’ photographs
are taken at 4.30am. Outside,
there will be fireworks and a
funfair on the Queen’s Lawn,
finishing at midnight.
Dinner tickets are priced at
£45, including a three course
meal. ‘Ents only’ tickets, cost-
ing £25 each, will grant access
to everything but the dinner.
Organisers hope to have a
liquor licence until 3am, and
will serve breakfast from
2.30am, included in all ticket
prices.
Sameena Misbahuddin, the
Deputy President (Finance
and Services), told Felix:
“We’re having the ball in
College because whenever
it’s been on campus it has
attracted a large number of
students, and we wanted to
make it accessible to as many
students as possible. It also
gives us the opportunity to
have several different rooms,
a funfair and fireworks.”
Last year’s ball, held at
Alexandra Palace, attracted
less than 1000 guests and
made a loss of over £15,000.
However, Ms Misbahuddin
said that she expected around
1500 people to attend this
year, and that less than 1000
would be needed to break
even, due to the funding that
has already been secured.
She added: “The majority
of other universities have a
large, formal college-wide
event to celebrate the end
of the year, and students at
Imperial deserve the same if
not better. It will be an excel-
lent way to end the year.”
Tickets will be available
from Monday at Union recep-
tion, the Union shop, Wye
College Union, the Reynolds
Bar at Charing Cross
Hospital, and other locations
to be announced.

Union launches Summer Ball 2005
Trevor Nelson: the headline
act at this year’s ball
By Rupert Neate
When the Southside area is
rebuilt next year, the popu-
lar Southside Bar will not be
replaced. The building is due
to be demolished in July, and
College redevelopment plans
make no allowance for a bar,
either during the reconstruc-
tion work or in the long term.
The new Southside, cost-
ing approximately £50m, will
occupy much less space than
the present one, being only
six storeys high compared to
the current nine. Space will
be lost throughout the build-
ing, particularly in communal
and retail areas. There will be
only one floor devoted to non-
residential activity, and this
will be predominately occu-
pied by an expanded health
centre and a café.
The College has stated that
due to the intense demands
on space, it is not possible
to have a licensed bar in the
new Southside. This will be
welcomed by local residents,
but not by students.
Mustafa Arif, President
of Imperial College Union,
believes that in the long term
there may not be sufficient
demand for a bar in Southside.
“Students are drinking less,
and the national trend is that
bar profits are in decline,”
he said. However, demand at
Southside Bar would appear
to be high – it is difficult to
get a seat most nights of the
week, and hard to even find
standing space on Wednesday
and Friday evenings.
Tony Mitcheson, the College
Secretary, told Felix that,
as a partial replacement for
Southside bar, “College has
proposed that the existing
hall bar in Linstead should
be refurbished and opened
to all Imperial College staff
and students and their bona
fide guests.” However, this
will not go ahead after objec-
tions were received from the
Union.
Mr Arif said: “The Union
objected to plans to move
Southside Bar into Linstead
Hall in the short term. It
Students enjoy a lunchtime drink at Southside Bar, which will be demolished this summer and not replaced
