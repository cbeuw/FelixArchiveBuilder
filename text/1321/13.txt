hindrance”
talks to Diana Pinn, Assistant
and sleepy staff

passes to be shown to a security
guard at the entrance – a system
criticised by Arif, who called the
guards “less than friendly” and the
job “the most boring imaginable”.
Predictably, Pinn disagrees. “What
I have a problem with is people
then calling the guard a fascist pig.
It’s not the guard’s fault, he’s doing
his job. It’s a requirement of the
Business School, and we’re provid-
ing a service.”
She adds that a swipe card bar-
rier would not solve the problem, as
people could still ‘tailgate’ in behind
others. So how else can access be
controlled? Those who would rather
see more ‘freedom’ on campus will
be disappointed to hear some of her
other ideas.
“I think in certain key buildings
you need access by turnstiles, and
that is coming, certainly for bio-
chemistry. We have to make sure
that the highly sensitive areas are
protected by access control and
security cameras.
Pinn believes that having the
college and department written
on a swipe card is itself a security
risk, just like leaving your address
attached to your keys.
“I was surprised [to discover that
the information appears on the
cards]. In the City you would never
find an access card with the name of
the firm on it. I did raise this and it
was discussed at a high level, but I
think people wanted something with
Imperial branded on it.”
She has “no objection” to add-
ing the Imperial College Union logo
to swipe cards, but “the layout is
dictated by corporate communica-
tions”.
Bicycle parking
Bicycle parking at College has been
a contentious issue for many stu-
dents, and Pinn admits: “I’ve got
more emails on my system about
bikes, motorbikes and car parking
than just about any other topic.”
“There were efforts to concen-
trate bike parking in certain areas
and make them as secure as pos-
sible,” she says. “If you concentrate
them [bicycles], you have a far bet-
ter chance of being able to catch a
thief... [but] it hasn’t gone down too
well with certain people because
unfortunately they’ve had to walk
further to their place of work.”
Cynics will not be surprised to
hear that one of the reasons for
removing bikes from Imperial
College Road was “to improve the
look of the campus”.
Pinn is optimistic that “the new
students will park their bikes where
we expect them to,” because they
have never known any different.
“It’s the old guard who don’t like the
change. There are some staff and
academics who dislike the change
enormously and are taking bikes
into buildings, which is a health and
safety no-no.”
She is critical of students who
were opposed to the new cycle racks
in Beit Quad. “Transport for London
gave them the money, they were
nice racks, carefully chosen... but
there was enormous furore about
them. It was just that they didn’t
want change. The shelters keep
the bikes dry and protect them, but
we only had bad comments about
them.”
Hall thefts
Following a spate of thefts from
halls of residence, I was keen to
find out how such incidents can be
prevented.
“We’re not going to stop the inci-
dents in halls, but we must reduce
them,” says Pinn.
Branch continues: “The simple
things are, don’t carry large wads of
cash. If you leave your room, even if
it’s just to go to the shower or visit
a friend, lock your door. If someone
follows you into hall and you’re not
comfortable challenging them, get
to a phone, call security and we’ll
always come and check it out.”
How did they get the message
across to freshers? “We went to
all the halls in Freshers Week and
got a good response, depending on
the wardens,” says Branch. “If the
wardens were very pro-active, eve-
rone was there and got the talk.
Other places, there wasn’t a good
response.
“This year, we’ll concentrate on
Evelyn Gardens, because there has
been a problem down there dur-
ing Freshers Week, especially with
thieves walking in after people. If I
can spare the manpower I’ll place
overnight security officers down
there.”
Both Pinn and Branch are confi-
dent in the security service’s ability
to keep the college safe and secure.
However, both readily accept that
improvements need to be made, and
would encourage students and staff
to play their part.
Pinn sums it up: “There are areas
of improvement that we’ve identified
we should make and we are making
every effort to make. We can’t do it
without the help and cooperation
of the other people on the campus.
Security guards try to do a job, a
good job, to the best of their ability.
If they fail in that, we must be told
to improve it, but they do need and
deserve support.”
