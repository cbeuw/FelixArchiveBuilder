College security: “a help, not a
In the first of a series of interviews with key figures at Imperial College, Dave Edwards
Director of Estates, and Terry Branch, Chief Security Officer, about bikes, thefts, ID cards
Security at Imperial College has
attracted coverage in the news,
comment and letters pages of Felix
this year. Thefts from halls of resi-
dence, problems with bicycle park-
ing and a less than perfect relation-
ship between students and security
staff are just some of the issues that
have been brought to our attention.
“I would like security to be seen
as a help, not a hindrance,” says
Diana Pinn, who holds much of the
responsibility for finding a suitable
balance between security and free-
dom on campus. Formerly in charge
of administration at Cazenove, an
investment bank in the City, she is
now Assistant Director of Estates at
Imperial College and took respon-
sibility for security in August last
year.
She describes Imperial College as
“fascinating... like a mini-town,” and
believes that security officers have
challenging roles to play within that
community.
“What has surprised me is the
sheer breadth of the role they [secu-
rity officers] have to deal with. They
have to be nannies for some of the
students who are away from home
for the first time, they have to be
receptionists, they have to be first-
aiders, they have to be quasi-par-
ents on occasion.
“Students do some amazingly
stupid things, in terms of money
and carelessness. If they’ve just
left home and had parents looking
after them, they’ve never had to
think, and from that point of view it’s
incredible what the security guards
are having to deal with.”
It surprises me to discover that
no prior training, experience or
qualifications are required for these
challenging roles.
“To work here, they [security
officers] have to have a ten year
checkable work history for criminal
records,” says Pinn. “Inevitably, not
all of them have had security expe-
rience, but if they’ve got common
sense and a good attitude they can
be trained.”
Terry Branch, the Chief Security
Officer (Operations), has been work-
ing at Imperial for four years. He
joins the interview late, having been
called away to an incident in the
Royal School of Mines building.
Branch thinks the relationship
between students and security offic-
ers has changed during his time
here: “I believe we’ve improved
upon it. There are some individuals
who get on much better with the
students than others and who have
built up a good relationship. And
we’re trying to improve the other
ones through good training.
“Dealing with students, we really
have to be on the ball. We’ve all
been there... if a student’s had a bit
to drink, you’ve got to understand
that, as long as they don’t overstep
the mark, a quiet word is always
better.”
Some security guards at Imperial
work shifts lasting 12 or 14 hours
each. Can they really be effective
under those conditions?
“Yes, I believe they can,” says
Branch confidently. “There are a lot
of big shifts across the board now,
but we’re trying to gradually reduce
them. It’s not as if they’re patrol-
ling all through the night without a
break.”
“On paper,” Pinn chips in, “one
of the difficulties is to make sure
they’ve got things to do and they’re
kept awake.”
Indeed, keeping staff awake over-
night seems to be a more difficult
task than it sounds. Having lived
and worked in Beit Quad, I’ve now
lost count of the number of times
I’ve seen a security guard asleep
on duty. Needless to say, their supe-
riors insist that such behaviour is
“taken very seriously”.
“One officer was reported [asleep]
by a student, and he’s no longer
with us,” says Branch. “He was dis-
missed. Two have been dismissed
for that since I’ve been here.”
“They’re paid to be there, awake
and doing the job,” adds Pinn. “If
you see it, ring control and tell them.
They will be disciplined.”
Following up on numerous com-
plaints from security officers them-
selves, I asked why hats – described
as “cheap imitation police caps” by
Union President Mustafa Arif – had
been introduced as part of their
uniform.
“I don’t like them myself,” admits
Branch, “but I believe the Rector
wanted us to have a higher profile
and make us stand out.”
Pinn enthusiastically supports the
uniform: “I believe that a hat or cap
contributes to the overall profes-
sional smart look and can also give a
guard confidence in dealing with an
incident. It gives them a status and
stature in terms of appearance that
helps them carry out the job.”
Identity cards
Writing in Felix in December, the
Union President called College
security “intrusive” and “unset-
tling”. Amongst other things, he
questioned whether students should
have to wear identity cards at all
times.
Is it necessary? Pinn thinks so, as
it would help to eliminate the prob-
lem of ‘tailgating’ at swipe doors:
“I would like people to wear ID
cards because if somebody comes
in behind you and they’ve got an ID
card, you don’t have to embarrass
yourself by asking whether they
should be there.
“But equally I understand there’s
no way we can enforce it when sen-
ior academics and staff would refuse
to wear them.”
She commends the Civil
Engineering department for their
‘wear your ID card at all times’
policy, and says she has no problem
with the Business School asking for
