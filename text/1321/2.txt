Despite receiving assuranc-
es that their departmental
library would remain open
“for some time”, mechanical
engineering students have
discovered that it will close
for good this summer.
The department’s reading
room, adjacent to the library,
has been taken over by the
Business School. As a result,
staff have decided to trans-
form the present library into
a reading room, moving all
books and collections to the
central library.
Speaking on behalf of the
current ‘council of professors’
that runs the department,
Professor Peter Cawley told
Felix: “We were placed in a
situation where we had no
reading room, and that was
our absolute priority. We
concluded that the present
library area was by far the
most suitable location. All the
books will be moved to the
central library, which as you
know has much longer open-
ing hours than mechanical
engineering, and so will be
accessible during evenings
and at weekends.”
The library currently holds
books, projects, exam papers
and solutions in a conven-
ient location. It is widely
used, especially during exam
periods. A petition against its
closure, signed by over 400
mechanical engineering stu-
dents, was given to the head
of department in January.
Students claimed that access
to crucial materials would be
lost in the central library, and
staff would not be able to pro-
vide the same level of specific
advice and service.
Helen Dawson, the mechan-
ical engineering department
representative, told Felix:
“The students are gob-
smacked that such an impor-
tant resource in our depart-
ment is being closed down,
and it is a sore blow when we
thought the library was saved
for now. No effort has been
made to move the library to
unused store rooms in a bid
to keep it.”
Felix understands that the
closure of the library was
widely supported by academ-
ics, who believed it to be in
students’ best interests.
Prof Cawley said: “I want to
make clear that our prior-
ity in discussing the future
of the library area has been
the interests of students. We
appreciatethatstudentsvalue
the services the departmen-
tal library offers and we will
be consulting students and
staff in the next few weeks on
what they need.”
One undergraduate in
mechanical engineering,
who wished to remain anony-
mous, told Felix: “Anyone
would think that Mech Eng is
a business for wannabe politi-
cians, not a university for the
education and stimulation of
the students.”

The mechanical engineering department library is to be transformed into a reading
room. The books will be moved to the central library instead
is unfair to leave Linstead
students with no private
communal space.” The result:
no Southside bar from sum-
mer 2005.
Mr Arif added: “If we moved
it to Linstead, it would not
be the same Southside Bar
anyway. It would be much
smaller, it would be on the
first floor, it wouldn’t have
the same atmosphere, and
College were intending for
the Union to run it.”
The closure of student bars
does not stop with Southside
– there are plans to close
both Weeks and Linstead
bars too. This change also
appears to stem from views
expressed by the Union. Mr
Mitcheson states: “ICU have
expressed the view that there
is over-capacity in bars in
the College and that the clo-
sure of the Linstead bar and
the bar in Weeks Hall, with
the refurbishment of both as
social spaces, is to be pre-
ferred. The College has no
objection to this and is now
proposing to go ahead on this
basis.”
No indoor sports
facilities
There will be no sports facili-
ties in Princes Gardens for
the duration of the autumn
term next year. This will give
Imperial the dubious honour
of being the only major uni-
versity in the country with-
out a fitness gym on campus.
The problem arises because
the new sports centre will not
open until January, having
been delayed for four months,
and the current fitness gym
in Southside will have been
demolished.
The College and Union
are currently in negotiations
with Fitness First in South
Kensington with regard to
a reduced membership rate
for students and a possible
College subsidy. Student
clubs and activities requiring
a sports hall are likely to be
helped to find alternative ven-
ues and/or reimbursed the
cost of travelling to Wilson
House.
Reduced communal
areas
The new Southside halls are
to have 70 more rooms and yet
the building will be reduced
in height by three storeys.
As a result, something has
to give. The main casualties,
aside from Southside Bar, will
be communal areas.
Surprisingly, given prevail-
ing student opinion that there
are already too many people
per kitchen, the plans are for
only one kitchen per floor per
hall. This could lead to up
to 30 people using the same
kitchen. The kitchens are
planned to double as com-
munal areas with sofas and
televisions.
Students to be
re-housed
Due to reduced capacity, the
College plans to house stu-
dents in private accommoda-
tion while Southside is being
rebuilt. The students will be
housed in hall-type accom-
modation run by UNITE
Housing.
UNITE featured in the
national press in October
2003, when students from the
University of Liverpool and
John Moores University expe-
rienced continuous problems
including leaks, a lack of hot
water and builders walking
into their rooms while they
were still in bed.
Imperial plans to lease
whole sections of UNITE’s
accommodation and run
them like Imperial-owned
halls with their own warden,
sub-warden and re-apps.
However, the UNITE proper-
ties are far from conveniently
situated for travel to Imperial
– Orient House is close to
Chelsea Wharf in Fulham,
and Piccadilly Court is in
northeast London.
The College plans to charge
approximately equal rates to
those charged for Imperial-
owned accommodation,
minus the cost of the neces-
sary travelcard.
Linstead will no longer
be catered
The College’s catering review
has recommended that a
shop or café outlet is needed
in Princes Gardens during
the Southside construction
project.
Mr Mitcheson said: “The
College is proposing to con-
vert the present Linstead
Hall dining room into a shop
and cafe. Linstead would then
no longer be a catered hall
and arrangements would be
made to ensure that those
resident in it would not be
disadvantaged by this.”
However, Linstead is
Imperial’s last remaining
catered hall, with some 9%
of students listing it as “very
important” in the Union’s
‘Your Say’ survey.
