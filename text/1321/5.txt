Emissions trading: is it the answer?
Under emissions trading agreements, will the environment become just another commodity to be
bought and sold? Simon Bennett investigates
It will not have escaped the attention
of Felix readers that climate change
and environmental issues have
recently been receiving increased
levels of publicity. Responsibility for
this appears to rest with the Kyoto
protocol and the precarious balance
of climate change issues at the top
of Tony Blair’s G8 agenda. Both are
admirable political efforts. Both will
be severely compromised by their
political basis (see Felix 1319, ‘Oh,
Kyoto! What a Complete Farce’ by
Richard Fenning).
For all the excited talk about Kyoto,
it is sad that perhaps its greatest
strength as an emissions reducer is
likely to ultimately undermine the
accomplishment of the task. I refer
to emissions trading. By trading per-
mits for greenhouse gas emissions,
it draws nations down a route of
environmental valuation. A scheme
that encourages profiteering from
environmental protection makes the
environment seem like just another
resource to be accounted for on the
balance sheet. It is a vital progres-
sion away from not accounting for
environmental impacts at all, but
does this solution take our worldview
closer, or further away, from one that
is harmonious with nature?
The premise of the Kyoto and
EU Emissions Trading Schemes is
that the current prevailing belief
system of capitalist economics has
not been sufficiently valuing envi-
ronmental impacts (see Felix 1318,
‘Cutting Carbon Under Kyoto’). As
a result, it is more profitable to pol-
lute than to invest in abatement if
the environmental detriment does
not directly harm the polluter’s cash
flow. Essentially, a dualist approach
that separates human operations
from environmental considerations
exists. A permit trading scheme
offers a method of attempting to
make the polluter pay for damage
caused. However, the outcome of
such a system is not one in which the
polluters will pay full compensation
for the casualties of their actions.
The outcome is that the overall level
of pollution by all polluters is merely
reduced by an amount dictated by
the number of permits allocated. No
compensation is ever received by
injured parties and the allocation is
made on a political basis.
Despite this, tradable permits
can be effective at reducing emis-
sions, as shown by the US Acid Rain
Program. Emissions reductions
are essential if we are to seriously
address climate change, and mar-
ket-based methods are politically
friendly since neither taxpayers nor
governments are especially finan-
cially burdened. Political sensitivi-
ties may have more impact on the
endorsement of Domestic Tradable
Quotas as proposed by the Tyndale
Centre’s research programme. If all
the inhabitants of the earth were
allocated a tradable carbon quota
then climate-friendly behaviour
would result. Or would it?
If the problem is that a dualist
belief system has become domi-
nant, in which nature and human
behaviour are regarded independ-
ently, then it should be this that is
addressed. Pricing the environment
makes our behaviour become even
more about the immediate needs
of the human race, promoting the
impression that the environment
exists for our benefit. This echoes
the biblical instruction that man
shall have “dominion over the works
of [God’s] hands”. It also suggests
that we can control nature through
technological change. In the wake
of recent natural disasters, this
appears further away than ever.
But the inference is not diminished
by the presence within many compa-
nies of environmental managers, a
title that compounds the impres-
sion that environmental improve-
ment is the product of control and
management of nature. Imperial
College itself may soon have its own
Environmental Manager and many
graduates of Imperial’s prestigious
MSc in Environmental Technology
may go on to take up such roles.
Indeed,manygraduatesofthecourse
will land some very influential posi-
tions having been indoctrinated by
the potential successes of economic
solutions such as emissions trading,
but having been given no debate on
the fundamental implications. Is it
really possible to assume that the
solution can be found within the
very model that is responsible for
the problem of dangerous pollution
levels? Such levels are side-effects
of the pursuit of technology to fuel
economic growth, a process that has
so far only served to concentrate
power in the hands of those with the
least regard for our environmental
legacy.
So as we enter what appears to
be an inevitable era of employing
markets to address environmental
issues, we should all be asking our-
selves a few vital questions:
Is the introduction of globally-
backed, market-based measures
a genuine cause for celebration?
Amending the problems of the cur-
rent system by introducing fixes that
place a value on the environment
will primarily benefit those who can
afford to buy their slice of nature.
The rest of the world will become the
most burdened, as it compensates
for such behaviour, doing nothing to
improve our fundamental relation-
ship with our environment. Whilst
tradable permits have been shown
to be effective emissions reducers,
they are inherently limited in scope.
We should continue to look beyond
these measures and not be scared
of looking outside the current sys-
tem. Effective policies that address
the behavioural causes of needless
carbon emissions might not be com-
plimentary to existing structures.
Are we really addressing the prob-
lem or merely the symptoms? Co-
existence with a healthy biosphere
surely demands that we live within
that biosphere and consider our-
selves to be one powerful compo-
nent of the planet’s biodiversity.
This means questioning whether
our measures serve to ingrain dual-
ist philosophies that encourage the
belief that we can ultimately ‘win’
the battle with nature. The problem
may not strictly be that we are not
valuing the environment, but that
we are using the wrong system of
valuation to make decisions about
the world’s future.
Does the current environmental
education system see the field too
narrowly? By working closely with
the main current employers in the
field, students are being equipped
to succeed within the current politi-
cal and economic paradigm. It may,
however, prove equally important to
educate students in the fundamental
failings of the system and the need
for longer-term solutions.
These are merely concerns to be
accounted for when considering the
claims about Kyoto. If radical chang-
es are threatened, are intrinsically
incremental measures good enough,
or are we consigning ourselves to
tinkering at the edges of the prob-
lem before we’ve even started to
address it?

The insidious effects of intellectual
property rights
By Jamie Brothwell
Imperial College Student Pugwash
The belief that intellectual prop-
erty rights have little impact on peo-
ple’s lives is an extremely danger-
ous public misconception. Are you
aware that patents make vital medi-
cines inaccessible to the people who
need them most? Or that 95% of
copyrighted works are no longer
available? Do you know the crisis
your own library faces because of
the increased commercialisation of
academic publishing, and can you
imagine how much worse things
are for libraries in developing
countries?
Last term, Rufus Pollock, director
of the Open Knowledge Foundation,
gave a talk addressing these issues,
hosted by the Student Pugwash
Society. He highlighted the radi-
cal new possibilities for equitable
information-sharing that have aris-
en with the internet, as well the
ever-increasing global regime of
intellectual property protection that
threatens them.
Coders and hackers who use open
source software are acutely aware
of the threat from inappropriate
applications of intellectual property
– the proposed European Software
Directive could lay free systems
such as Linux open to a flood of
litigation.
Environmentalists, on the other
hand, or those who campaign for a
fairer deal for developing nations,
are often unaware of the all-per-
vasive effects of ‘intellectual prop-
erty’. There is a great deal of
debate over the rights and wrongs
of the World Trade Organisation,
but when did you last hear about
the World Intellectual Property
Organisation? Away from the pub-
lic gaze, they are implementing a
programme of harmonisation that
has recently led India to outlaw the
production of generic medicines.
Currently, India supplies 60% of
the generic AIDS drugs used in
Africa.
The Open Knowledge Foundation
(OKF) exists to promote aware-
ness of these issues, to campaign
for fairer legislation and to foster
projects that use the principles of
open access to information. The
OKF will be back at Imperial at the
start of the next academic year, talk-
ing and orchestrating a campaign
to increase access to academic lit-
erature – an issue that affects each
and every one of us. Meanwhile
look them up online: www.

Summer ball and the Union building
Summer ball
It’s that time of the year – and
that means the Imperial Summer
Ball. The date for your diaries is 18
June. This year’s ball will be held at
the South Kensington campus and
will include all the old favourites,
plus some exciting improvements
on previous years. With sponsorship
and money from College, it will be
the unmissable event of the year.
With a drinks reception, a funfair
on the Queen’s lawn, fireworks and
music all night with Radio 1 DJ
Colin Murray, MTV’s Trevor Nelson
and jazz, it looks set to be a great
evening. This year’s event will carry
on until 4.30am, with a survivors’
photo and free breakfast for all
those who last that long. Our spon-
sors have donated loads of fantastic
giveaways including MP3 players.
All this and more is included for just
£25 for an ents ticket.
As in previous years, there will be a
dining option at £45 per head, which
includes all of the above as well as a
three course meal in a marquee for
500 people on the Queen’s lawn.
The summer ball is the biggest
event the Union holds and is an
excellent way to end the year in
style with your friends.
Union building
Does your Union building meet your
needs? Ever thought that Beit Quad
could do with a revamp? In the cen-
tre pages of this newspaper, you will
see ideas from the architects on the
future of the Union building. Initial
feedback was sought during the
Strategic Review surveys and focus
groups last term and now there is
another opportunity to give your
feedback, via the Union website.
Focus groups will be held during the
next month. So turn to the centre
pages and discover how your Union
and its building can offer you more.
‘No smoking’ trial in DaVinci’s
Two months into the ‘no smok-
ing’ trial in the Union’s café/bar
DaVinci’s, we have been inundated
with feedback, both for and against
the trial, by email to yoursay@ic.
ac.uk and through the Yoursay feed-
back forms.
Thank you to all those who have
aired their views – we need as much
information as possible to ascertain
whether ‘no smoking’ will contin-
ue after the trial ends and will be
using the feedback and suggestions
received in this evaluation. Keep
your thoughts coming...
