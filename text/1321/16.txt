Hello again, felicitous solvers all.
This week’s puzzle has an unusually
large concentration of clues of one
particular type, for no particular
reason. I suppose you could think
of it as showing up, by way of com-
parison, just how sober and careful
we setters have to be in order to
give a good, unobtrusive distribu-
tion of clue-types. Or perhaps you
could think of it as an entertaining
gimmick in lieu of a specific theme.
Either way, I hope you have fun with
the puzzle – and don’t forget that
there are prizes to reward persist-
ent solvers, so don’t be shy about
sending in your solutions.
