Imperial take ULU Cup
in dramatic style
ULU Cup final
Imperial Men’s 1st 2
UCL Men’s 1st 2
Imperial won 4-2 on penalties
By Essex Wideboy
The legendary Imperial
Cavaliers finished the sea-
son with the one trophy they
wanted after a tense match
that ended with three yellow
cards, silver goal extra time
and the excitement of a pen-
alty stroke competition.
After the ladies’ victory in
their match, it was up to the
Cavaliers to make it a dou-
ble for the best hockey club
in London. Having beaten
the opposition already in the
league match a week earlier,
Imperial were confident of
repeating the feat.
As for warm up, the
dynamic stretching of UCL
was matched by the usual jog
around the pitch and smash-
ing of balls into an empty
goal by Imperial. An inspired
tactical change by Toadfish
saw the Harvester slot into
the usual backline of Sieve,
George Harrison, Foetus and
Batty. Laruso was called back
from his spearhead attacking
position to the holding mid-
field role, along with Stinky
and Essex Wideboy, providing
the attacking ammunition for
the deadly strike force that is
Piles, Toadfish and Flegm.
Imperial started with typi-
cal verve and began to spread
the play with pinpoint pass-
ing through the midfield
and quick movement up
front. Then disaster struck
as Stinky had to be substi-
tuted after being taken down.
Tallulah stepped in with calm
assurance and took up the
defensive position almost
immediately.
Then the UCL counterfeit
version of Essex Wideboy
proceeded to throw himself
over the shoulder of George
Harrison to earn the reclu-
sive Beatle five minutes in
the sin bin. Imperial survived
the power play with energetic
running from Laruso and
rock solid defending from
Foetus.
Straight after George got
back on the pitch, Flegm, the
top scorer for the year with
his slip deflections, latched
on to a ball from Toadfish to
score in the bottom right hand
corner. Have it. It was then
that the umpires, two former
students of UCL (whether
they ever graduated was not
confirmed), further disgraced
themselves by attempting to
wipe the goal off for Imperial
having “too many players on
the pitch”. The problem was
quickly rectified by the tour-
nament director. Open your
eyes, ump.
Imperial then went further
ahead from a familiar source.
In his last match for the cava-
liers after four years of serv-
ice, Essex Wideboy managed
to score from the base line
from another through ball by
Toadfish. Goal pie. The half
ended with Imperial 2-0 in
front.
The second half started
with the Anal Executioner
taking to the field to give
Flegm a much needed
breather. Almost immedi-
ately, Harvester proceeded
to do what a Harvester does
and ate his opposition alive
with a crunching tackle from
behind. That’s five minutes’
rest in the sin bin for him
then.
George Harrison, not
happy about being matched
in the yellow card stakes,
then decided to have another
run-in with the same UCL
player and thus took another
yellow and off he went again.
Special.
Unfortunately, after
Imperial were restored to a
full team, UCL came back
with two good goals of their
own, especially one by their
captain with a reverse stick
strike from top of the D.
Both teams became defen-
sive in extra time and the
inevitability of a penalty
shoot-out loomed.
Having practised their pen-
alty skills against ICSM in
the previous round, Imperial
were confident of the flick
takers.
Cometh the hour, cometh
the Man. Sieve, the Imperial
keeper, who has never lost a
stroke competition in his life,
gave a virtuoso performance
in goal, saving two out of four
flicks.
Foetus, Toadfish and Piles
all scored, but Essex Wideboy
hit a weak effort straight at
the ‘keeper. It all fell on Flegm
in the end, and he didn’t let
all you UCL-hating people
down.
So to sum up, it was a leg-
endary performance, ending
a legendary year in a legen-
dary way.
HOCKEY
Imperial’s men’s hockey team, who triumphed over UCL
on penalty strokes in the final of this year’s ULU Cup
Queen Mary Men’s 5th 4
Imperial Men’s 7th 2
By Will Swannell
Apparently there were a cou-
ple of cup finals involving
Imperial teams on one clear
warm Saturday last term, but
in the eyes of the Sevenths
there was only one match
that counted – a six-pointer
away to Queen Mary’s.
We began the trek down to
Chiselhurst with our team
down to the bare bones. There
were no substitutes and
defenders Kofi and Will were
both nursing self-inflicted
knee injuries, but confidence
was high as we had spanked
QM 4-2 in our last meeting.
The game started out a
scrappily with neither team
finding their feet, but after
a few minutes an innocuous
challenge from Will caused
his knee to flare up and he
had to go off. QM pressed
the one man advantage home
and scored what can only be
described as a soft goal, with
’keeper Ario unsighted as a
poor volley from the edge of
the area looped into the net.
Will then came back on as
Imperial started to get back
into the game, with Ryan
flashing a header past the
far post.
But QM somehow added a
second as a ball was played
into the box and the QM
striker pounced to lash it ball
past the advancing ‘keeper.
It was only when we were 2-
0 down that we started to play,
with Andrea, who had been
solid at the back all game,
powering a header just wide
at the far post. Sam was also
unlucky when he was denied
a stone wall penalty as a QM
defender blocked his cross
with his hand.
At half time we were still 2-0
down, but with Ryan imperi-
ous in midfield and Tuan look-
ing sharp up front, our tails
were up.
We were dominating the
game at the start of the sec-
ond half and had QM pinned
back. The goal came as Sam
swung in a corner which Tuan
nodded through the ‘keep-
er’s legs to end his recent
drought.
The second soon followed
as Sam slid a through ball
to Tuan, who finished with
aplomb. QM were now on the
ropes as we pushed forward
to complete the comeback.
Ryan, who had been ghost-
ing past the QM defence all
afternoon, hit a peach of a
volley which stung the hands
of the ‘keeper.
Then,withImperialstillrun-
ning the show, things started
to go a bit pear-shaped as
Will and Andrea managed to
injure themselves.
Pushing for a winner,
Imperial were hit on the
break as the QM striker held
off John’s challenge to stroke
the ball home and reclaim
the lead. Soon afterwards, it
was 4-2 when Will foolishly
decided to be a bit fancy and
the ball ended up with a QM
attacker who rounded Ario
and scored.
We were left sick as par-
rots wondering how we had
lost and with Andrea debat-
ing how he was going to get
to hospital.
