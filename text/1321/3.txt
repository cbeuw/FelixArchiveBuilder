Astronomers clearly have
no idea about marketing.
The first direct observation
of a planet outside of our
Solar System, and what
do they decide to call it?
2M1207b.
How naive can you be? How
can you capture the public’s
imagination by naming the
first ever planet observed
outside of the solar system
after the number plate of
the lead researcher’s
Mondeo?
In the past, they named
planets after gods: Jupiter
was ‘the ruler of the heav-
ens’. They named Neptune
after ‘the ruler of the oceans’.
Mars is ‘the god of war’.
Constellations take their
names from mythical beasts.
Galaxies are named after
characters in mythology
such as Andromeda, Perseus,
Eosphorus and M-77 (NGC
1068)... OK, maybe not the
last one. They even named
Pluto after Mickey Mouse’s
dog.
A similar problem has been
encountered in atomic phys-
ics. Here, physicists’ original-
ity was put to the test when it
came to naming certain new
radioactive elements. Their
solution? They started nam-
ing the new elements after
planets (92-Uranium, 93-
Neptunium, 94-Plutonium),
celebrity scientists (99-
Einsteinium), and America
(95-Americium).
Perhaps there are simply
not enough Greek symbols,
gods and myths to name
new particles and plan-
ets? Rubbish argument. We
humans don’t have ‘enough
names’ to go round – which is
why we have surnames and
nicknames. So why don’t you
call the new planet ‘Jupiter
Fivetimes’ (because the plan-
et is supposed to be five times
the size of Jupiter)?
People may argue that this
is unimportant, that name-
calling should not get in the
way of the serious business of
finding new stuff.
But the scientific nomen-
clature headache is develop-
ing into a migraine. In biol-
ogy, geneticists are facing a
similar problem. Working in
relative isolation, different
researchers studying on dif-
ferent species have become
attached to thier own respec-
tive gene-naming traditions.
Those studying Drosophila
(fruit fly), for instance,
indulge in using gene names
such as ‘Sonic the Hedgehog’
and ‘Lost in Space’. Other
research groups may call the
same genes by another name,
and more often than not it
is hard for different research
cultures to agree on a shared
name.
In the words of Michael
Ashburner of the EBI
(European Bioinformatics
Institute), “biologists would
rather share a toothbrush
than share a gene name...
gene nomenclature is beyond
redemption.”
The first direct observation
of the exoplanet is a major
achievement, especially if you
consider that the first brown
dwarf (body too small to be
a star, too big to be a planet)
was only observed in 1994.
Let’s do this new planet
justice by giving it a proper
name. One easy solution?
Corporate sponsorship.
Advertisers would pay good
money to sponsor historic
celestial objects. Who needs
2M1207b, when you can have
Planet Orange? Or even
Planet Pringles...

Channel 4’s Time Team,
that successful gang of his-
tory hounds fronted by Tony
Robinson (better known
to many as Baldrick from
the BBC comedy series
Blackadder), have descended
upon their first site of 2005 for
a manic three days of uncov-
ering relics and architecture
for their thirteenth series.
The first episode was
filmed in March at a
Northamptonshire site called
Glendon Hall where a local
resident, Martin Hipwell, had
uncovered a body when build-
ing a home for his mother.
Not just one body, but body
after body. He then called in
the local archaeologists, who
put him on to Time Team. I
joined them there and met
Tony ‘Cunning Plan’ Robinson
over a sumptuous lunch to
hear all about his love of his-
tory.
Tony never liked history
much at school, or school
in general, but as an adult,
he has an infectious enthu-
siasm about understanding
the past, to such an extent
that Teachers’ TV managed
to draft him in to teach a his-
tory lesson!
One of my interests, apart
from meeting funnyman
Robinson, was in the sci-
ence that helps to make the
programme possible, not the
technology of the cameras
and the sound, but the geo-
physics.
Cue John Gator. He is the
man responsible for this
area of the programme and
presents the geophysical
findings to camera. An expert
with 18 years experience in
geophysics, he has his own
independent consultancy
and is associate editor of the
Journal of Archaeological
Prospection.
The geophysics team con-
sists of three highly trained
operatives including John.
They use three different sur-
vey techniques – magnetom-
etry, resistivity and ground
penetrating radar – to try to
locate sites of significance for
the diggers without having to
actually excavate.
Electric measurements
have been used in area sur-
veys since the 1940s. A resis-
tivity survey works by send-
ing small electrical currents
into the ground and measur-
ing the variations in resist-
ance as the current meets
obstructions. High resistiv-
ity readings indicate possi-
ble foundations, floors, paths
or roads, and low resistivity
readings are produced by pits
and waterlogged ditches.
Fluxgate gradiometers are
used to measure small anom-
alies in the earth’s magnetic
field. They were specially
developed for use in archaeo-
logical prospecting and have
been around since the 1970s.
They work by measuring the
vertical gradient using two
fluxgate sensors either 0.5m
or 1.0m apart. They have an
adjustable range and are
extremely sensitive, detect-
ing changes as small as 0.5
nanotesla. It’s a fast method
that can be used for scan-
ning or for a more detailed
survey. It’s been used to find
kilns, ditches, pits, furnaces,
hearths and much more. I
can’t tell you what it detected
at Northamptonshire – I don’t
want to spoil the surprise!
The final method they
used for the Northampton-
shire show was Ground
Penetrating Radar – GPR
– which is used for shallow
prospection. It’s a relatively
new technique that uses the
absorption and reflection
of electromagnetic waves.
Waves are transmitted into
the ground and reflected back
when they hit different lay-
ers such as soil, concrete or
rock. It provides stratigraphic
information and defines dis-
continuities. It enables the
depth of targets to be estimat-
ed based on the time it takes
for the waves to be reflected.
It can also be used, when data
is collected along a series of
close parallel passes is com-
bined, to create a 3D image
of the area.
Geophysics is a key tool
in unlocking archaeological
secrets and has been used by
Time Team right from the off.
It makes a huge difference
to what can be discovered in
the pressured three days of
explorations.
The geophysics team
worked tirelessly during the
year’s first dig to undertake
their surveys and then ana-
lyse the results in a bid to
discover when and how these
bodies came to be here. I
can’t tell you any more I’m
afraid, apart from to say that
they’ll need more cupboards
for the skeletons galore, and
you’ll have to wait and see!

First direct observation of exoplanet
Last week astronomers confirmed the first direct observation of a planet outside the Solar System.
Darius Nikbin looks at the new discovery and discusses the hazards of nomenclature
“...they started
