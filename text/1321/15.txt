WIN House of
Flying Daggers
on DVD
Set in a nowhere town somewhere
in America, Mean Creek follows a
group of friends on boating trip.
Except all is not what it seems, and
soon enough the boat trip becomes
everyone’s worst nightmare.
Initially we see Sammy (Rory
Culkin) being bullied by George
(Josh Peck), a boy who’s just thought
of as a fat retard – he’s had to repeat
his year so many times. After tell-
ing his older brother Rocky (Trevor
Morgan) what happened, the group
of friends resolve to teach George
a lesson, although Sammy will only
agree to it if the boys come up with
a plan that doesn’t physically hurt
George.
So they do; but the reason why
each person wants to be involved in
this is very murky. Rocky calls up
George to invite him to his broth-
er’s non-existent birthday party – I
guess it’s not that hard to imagine a
boy with no friends readily jumping
at the chance of going, even though
he’d pulverised Sammy the other
day. Running alongside this sto-
ryline is Sammy and Millie’s blos-
soming relationship. The first date
happens to coincide with boat party,
which Millie knows nothing about.
After Millie forces Sammy to
explain what’s going on, she makes
him promise to stop the plan – it’s
too mean and George actually seems
to be OK once you get to know him.
The only thing you can fault him
for on the trip is trying to impress
Marty. He essentially wants what
everyone else wants – to be accept-
ed. The rest of the group agree to
drop the plan, some more readily
than others, but Marty doesn’t seem
to want to let it go.
The boat trip caries on, but George
keeps pushing all the wrong but-
tons. It’s as if the boy has verbal
diarrhoea and just doesn’t know
when to stop. In fact, he pushes
so many buttons that Millie, the
group’s moral compass, allows the
boys to carry on with the plan – a
game of Truth or Dare. All starts out
fine, but soon the game spirals out
of control and George finds out what
they want to do to him. Terrible and
painful secrets are unleashed on
the group.
The friends are left to deal with
the powerful lifelong consequences
as their loyalty to each other is put
to the test. I really wish I could tell
you what happens but that would be
spoiling it if you go, and believe me,
you should.
Mean Creek is a stereotypical
indie film, but in the best way possi-
ble – it looks ordinary but is actually
an amazing find, quite literally since
it doesn’t seem to be playing in most
cinemas. The director has used a
mix between film photography and
home video, which becomes more
important towards the end when
we see George’s perspective on life.
Using hand-held camera and natu-
ral light, director of photography
Sharone Meir gets the sun-dappled
greenery of a perfect summertime
day. The music is fantastic and
matches that dirty, downbeat, low-
key look of the film.
The acting shines out – everyone
delivers great performances, espe-
cially Carly Schroeder (Millie) and
Scott Mechlowicz (Marty), who just
stand out. The storyline isn’t too
taxing on the mind either but it is
a brilliant script – the characters
are complex and the relationships
are well-developed. The film really
begins to shine when the characters
realise that everything isn’t always
black and white but more likely sev-
eral shades of grey.
I know that there a quite a few
big films out at the moment, but
this really is perfect for a sunny
afternoon or evening this summer.
If you’ve never seen an indie film
before, this is good one to start off
with. The entire cinema was left in
silence, a sign of a great film.
