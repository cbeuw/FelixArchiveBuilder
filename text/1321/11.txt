There is a little village in
Wales, called Hay-on-Wye,
where the ratio of inhabit-
ants to second-hand book-
shop is about 150:1. What sort
of social routine leads to 38
bookshops in a small village
in a singularly remote corner
of the world? The Imperial
College Science Fiction
Society (ICSF) organised a
road trip there, in an attempt
to bring you the answer to this
and other mysteries, and also
to buy books for our library.
The day started in a very
unusual manner, as the 12
members of the party met in
the right place at the right
time and set off on their jour-
neys ahead of schedule. After
four hours, we all managed
to meet again in Hay-on-Wye
without too much lasting
brain damage from in-car
stereos.
After finding our Bed and
Breakfasts and some food, we
set on to explore the won-
derful world of second–hand
bookshops.
The type of bookshop var-
ied across the town, from
specialised bookshops to the
amusing Castle bookshop,
with its shelves of chaos and
amusing books, and the box
to pay for your books (50p
for hardbacks and 30p for
paperbacks!) It was here that
we found some of the jewels
of our trip, especially Two’s
Company, Three’s A Swing
which managed to shock eve-
ryone in the random three
page test, and The Bluffer’s
Guide To University with its
all-too-familiar descriptions
of our own lives.
After an afternoon of rather
silly book–shopping, we found
ourselves without a purpose,
and we headed on to the pub.
There we indulged ourselves
in some celebration drinking.
As our conversations danger-
ously shifted from random
trip talk to uni talk, each of us
were one by one forbidden to
talk about our respective sub-
jects, creating a serious strain
on both the geeks amongst us
and their livers.
Despite a late night and
some problems with the sleep
arrangements (for example,
two of us being locked out
of their B&B), we all man-
aged to meet again at 10am
to carry on. It was here that
a new member joined our
party: a two metre long pink
and blue fluffy snake.
This is a small town, and
here we were, 12 Imperial
students, poring over books,
buying science fiction and
carrying a pink snake. We
were asked questions...
Armed with maps and
determination, we managed
to visit most of the book-
shops, including the cinema.
Hay-on-Wye is a place crazy
enough to turn its cinema and
its fire station into bookshops;
because, of course, who needs
a fire station in a village made
out of books?
Amongst some of our best
acquisitions, you can find
titles from Brian Aldiss, Neil
Gaiman and Tom Holt.
On leaving, we provided
local entertainment when we
tried to fit about 50 books and
a gigantic pink snake into the
already over-filled boots of
two very small cars. Don’t try
this at home, kids.
If you want to see the pink
snake or read our new books,
you can find them in the ICSF
library (west wing basement,
Beit Quad) pretty much
any time of the day. See you
there!
