Liverpool is one of the oldest provincial
Universities and is situated in an area famous
for it's beat music. It has been called the
" modern culture " centre of England. The
University has all faculties and is not just
confined to science and technology as we are
at Imperial College.
The University is being expanded to cater
for about 10,000 students although there are
only about half that number at present.
About one third of these students are in the
Halls of Residence which are situated 2\
miles from the University in a University
Village which is being expanded as new Halls
are built.
