Touchstone Weekend on 'Race*
Education Needed
b y M a r t i n B e l l .
M R . A . H . CHRISTIE, M.A., Hon. Sec. of the Royal Anthro-
pological Institute, was the speaker at the last Touchstone weekend
on "Race." No ardent "pure racists!1
" were present, and so the
weekend was mainly spent discussing what forms race prejudice took
and how it could be prevented.
He dealt first with the myth of race from biological facts ; there
is no biological validity for doubting that man is all of one single
species, Homo sapiens. The human race has not had time to develop
significant mutations, but isolated groups had. adapted themselves to
circumstances and had responded to ecological pressures. For
instance, the genes of Jewish groups throughout the world were found
to have no common factors and the genes approximated to the
groups in which the Jews were situated, in spite of their endogamous,
isolated situation. Thus the notion of pure " race " was nonsense.
There was a tendency, he said, in
all races to regard a fair skin as so-
cially desirable. It indicated wealth
and leisure, and he referred to the
upper class T h a i girls who could not
get married because of their dark
skins. There were psychological rea-
sons also, such as fear of the dark
and the fundamental mystery of
Light/Dark, G o o d / E v i l . T h e world
is for many divided into " them " and
" u s " under the slogan " a b r o a d is
bloody," but though differences
might be social, religious, historical,
liqual, technological, and coloured,
there was no such thing as fundamen-
t a l inferior or superior races.
It w a s decided that t h e best, indeed
the o n l y , answer t o r a c i s m is w i d e -
spread a n d early e d u c a t i o n , b u t that
this w a s n o t e n o u g h b y itself : one
m u s t also legislate against r a c i a l d i s -
c r i m i n a t i o n (the U L lodgings b u r e a u
was criticised f o r k e e p i n g the names
of landladies w h o d i s c r i m i n a t e rac-
i a l l y ) , i n order t o speed the process
u p . W e m u s t a l l facilitate m i x e d m a r -
riages a n d h o p e to r e m o v e the u n d e -
sirable social consequences, especially
f o r the c h i l d r e n . F o r r a c e - m i x t u r e
has h a d practically n o t h i n g b u t g o o d
effects u p o n m a n as a n o r g a n i s m , a n d

Such weekends, with excellent food
and glorious surroundings at a very
cheap price, ought to be i n very high
demand. T h e company was not i n -
credibly intellectual—the discussions
were within everyone's grasp. A n d
the Sunday morning spent walking i n
Windsor Great Park or reading the
Sunday papers, all combined to make
it an excellent stay.
at the beginning, b u t these were s o o n
