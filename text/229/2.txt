Loans lobby
What did we gain?
I C U N I O N has n o w m a d e its feelings on the pos-
sible i n t r o d u c t i o n of a loans system to uni-
versity students clear to M e m b e r s of the
P a r l i a m e n t just dissolved.
In spite of its perhaps d i s a p p o i n t i n g l y s m a l l n u m -
bers, last fortnight's l o b b y is considered by
the organisers to have been a success. T h e
first question that w i l l be a s k e d — i f it has not
already been r a i s e d — i n v i e w of the bare
h u n d r e d - o d d I C students is ' D o w e r e a l l y
c a r e ? "
T h e answer cannot but be to the affirmative. A s
the last U n i o n M e e t i n g s h o w e d , the m a j o r i t y
— s o m e three times as m a n y as w e n t to
W e s t m i n s t e r — a r e i n f a v o u r o f the present sys-
t e m of no onus for repayments. B u t few are
prepared to do a n y t h i n g p r a c t i c a l .
H o w e v e r , there is a significant m i n o r i t y w h o are
i n f a v o u r of a system o f loans. M a n y of
these have suffered t h r o u g h the means test, a n d
they also h a d their s p o k e s m e n at Westminster.
It is debatable whether o u r a c t i o n w i l l h a v e any
noticeable effect w h e n a n d i f a B i l l f o r student
loans is p u t before P a r l i a m e n t . B u t we have
at least stirred that elephantine b o d y to w h i c h
w e do n o t c o n t r i b u t e — t h e N a t i o n a l U n i o n of
S t u d e n t s — i n t o a c t i v i t y . I n just one week
they have scraped the butter f r o m one side o f
their slice of bread a n d spread i t o n the other.
A f o r t n i g h t ago N U S was u n c o m m i t t e d a n d
resented I C U ' s a c t i o n . L a s t week President
B i l l Savage a n n o u n c e d that the loans issue
had l o o m e d f r o m the b a c k c l o t h s to centre
s t a g e — r e d u c i n g the question of m e m b e r s h i p
of I S C a n d / o r I U S to petty squabbles.
Certainly a number of M P s were agreeably im-
pressed by I C ' s representation. N o w we
should move on to consider the whole question
of payments to students. What we want now
is, surely, the same as one U n i o n Meeting last
year requested—a full maintenance grant not
subject to a means test. N o compromise will
do.
D e a r P e r s o n ,
Wake UP, happU Campers T h a n k y o u f o r y o u r letter of the last issue, I
feel o b l i g e d to strain m y l i m i t e d intelligence to its
I nearly v o m i t e d w i t h joy w h e n I read that the
C o l l e g e w i l l m a n a g e to create fifty n e w places for
p a r k i n g by a r r a n g i n g cars d i a g o n a l l y a n d other
stunts. M y r e a c t i o n to the news a b o u t the C o l c u t t
flagpole was i n d e s c r i b a b l y v o l u m i n o u s . H o w the
C o l l e g e can persist i n a " head-in-the-sand " p o l i c y
o n the vast areas of free g r o u n d i n a n d a r o u n d
the new b u i l d i n g s beats me. S o the t o w e r is g o i n g
to be a free standing c a m p a n i l e — w o n d e r f u l , just
w h a t we need. A n d the l a n d a r o u n d it landscaped
they s a y , — o h l o v e l y ; it'll m a k e the t u t o r i a l sheets
seem m u c h easier. O f course, it c a n o n l y do this
if y o u c a n get into C o l l e g e i n the first place. W i t h
cars o n the increase, and p a r k i n g places o n the de-
crease, i t w i l l soon be" i m p o s s i b l e to even get here.
Is it realistic to t u r n this place into a n a c a d e m i c
D i s n e y l a n d , w h e n the flat areas c o u l d be usefully
utilised as car-parks? T h e r e is plenty o f grass i n
H y d e P a r k , w h y do we have to a d d to it? A n d as
f o r that f a b b y t o w e r — u g h !
v e r y b o u n d a r i e s to r e p l y to y o u r thesis, d r a w n no
d o u b t by y o u r irresistible carrot.
T o say that F E L I X readers are b o r e d m a y be
true; sales seem to indicate that boredoiri is v e r y
p o p u l a r , a n d so w h y not give the people w h a t they
want, I a m w o r r i e d b y y o u r assertion that better
m a t e r i a l is excluded, a n d y o u r further suggestion
that I a m replaced by a regular s e r m o n f r o m y o u r
c r o w d . I cannot i m a g i n e a n y t h i n g m o r e s c i n t i l -
lating t h a n a broadside of p r e a c h i n g to grace the
pages of F E L I X ; surely even C o o p e r ' s nonsense is
preferable to 8 c o l u m n inches of religious i n d u l g -
ence a n d p o l i t i c a l " p r o p e r - g a n d e r . "
A n d since y o u started the personal insults track,
m a y I suggest that instead of o n l " getting u p off
y o u r knees to r e a c h for y o u r T h e s a u r u s , y o u spare
a few m i n u t e s a day s o r t i n g out the sheep f r o m
the goats; pr s h o u l d it be gentiles f r o m the P h a r i -
sees? Q u o r u m i n p e n d u l o r u m .

The last word
on posters
SIR,
I have just read Mr. Baramkis
letter in FELIX for 9 March..
Not having Mr. Baramki's obvious
familiarity with army barracks or the
rooms of sex maniacs, I am in no
position to pass such strong judgment
on your poster as he is. However, as
one who has for some time had the
unenviable job of attempting to get
people to read posters, may I suggest
that before condemning the various
publicity officers in IC he should at-
tempt to find an easier solution than
banning sex.
In a College with so much internal
advertising—much of it of a very high
standard—it is difficult to get one's
posters read unless they are eye-
catching and stand out from the mass.
Having accepted this one simple
fact—obvious to those of even limited
intellect—we must find'an eye-catch-
ing poster. Regrettable though it
may be, one very effective gimmick
in an almost completely male society
is a pretty girl ; this 'has been proved
to work over and over again.
If Mr. Baramki would like to con-
tact me I would be pleased to hear
his suggestions for improved publicity.
It is perhaps best to conclude by
asking which College poster has had
most effect on Mr. Baramki. Could I
suggest that this is a measure of i s
effectiveness as publicity, defined—Hot
by me—as the art of keeping the
name of the product in the eye of
the public as much as possible.
Could it be the FELIX poster in
question, my only complaint about it
is the poor standard of reproduction.

An appeal for
the fete
SIR,
We wish to draw to the attention of
the Union the Carnival Fete and Pro-
cession (?) which are being held on
i4 May. 120 letters concerning this,
and requesting a quick reply, have
been sent to societies, halls and de-
partment reps., to ascertain who will
be providing stalls and floats. At the
lime of writing, almost two weeks
since the Utters were sent out, we
have received only nine replies; if
those in positions of responsibility
cannot be relied on to reply to a re-
quest such as this, we suggest that
they should not have taken on their
respective jobs.
Will the people who have not yet
replied please do so with the utmost
haste so that we can get on with our
job of organising the /'etc.
R. W. DRA YTOX.
