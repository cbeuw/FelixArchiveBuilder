"DEMOCRACY i n I n d i a i s o:nly an experiment", s a i d Mr Hhanna, F o r e i g n Correspondent of
THE TIMES OF INDIA at a j o i n t meeting of the Indian and Communist S o c i e t i e s . As such, i t
i s not an e s s e n t i a l part of t h e I n d i a n nation, but may be discarded i f i t i s seen to have
failed'.
At present, democracy c a n n o t be s a i d to have e i t h e r completely f a i l e d or completely
succeeded. I t has given I n d i a d i g n i t y and a sense of u n i t y , born w i t h her independence
(an achievement conspicuously Lacking i n the cases of Egypt o r the USSR, f o r i n s t a n c e ) , &
the economic r e c o r d i s i m p r e s s i v e .
Howevenji the gap betw.een the r i c h and the poor has not yet been closed, there has
been no s i g n i f i c a n t r i s e i ^ n l i v i n g standards, and the government has completely f a i l e d to
c o n t r o l the p o p u l a t i o n e ^ i o s i o n . At the moment a l l the p o l i t i c a l t a l e n t , much of i t
mediocre, l i e s i n the Congress l a r t y .
The Communists ar^e d i s u n i t e d and of a very low c a l i b r e , and m i l i t a r y r u l e vrould be
unrepresentative of ajjj. the peoples, and thus democracy has the best chance of succeeding,
so long as i t can f i r ^ d strong l e a d e r s .
The ensuing d i s . s c u s s i o n concerned i t s e l f mainly w i t h comparing the s i t u a t i o n i n China
(which was where tbie Communist S o c i e t y came i n t o i t s own) and I n d i a . The Communists were
at a great disadvantage as t h e y knew very l i t t l e of the problems of I n d i a , and were un-
c e r t a i n as to how to solve them. Much i n t e r e s t i n g d i s c u s s i o n took place, however, and
proved most i n f o r m a t i v e . / M a r t i n B e l l
