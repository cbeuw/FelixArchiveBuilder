Alchemist marred
A H O U S E that was over half
empty helped to mar what might
have been a good performance of
The Alchemist, last Wednesday.
This Jacobean Comedy by Ben
Jonson was supposed to be funny
and an indulgent audience would
have helped enormously. Alas,
this was not to be. There were
pieces of bawdy humour but these
were scarce.
T h e p l o t i n v o l v e d the s w i n d l i n g
dealings of a w i l y threesome, J e r e m y
the servant, S u b t l e the p r o f e s i o n a l a l -
chemist and D o l C o m m o n . T h e
scene is the house o w n e d b y J e r e m y ' s
master w h o has fled L o n d o n because
o f the plague. T h e story is i n v o l v e d
w i t h m a n y d o u b l e dealings, e n d i n g
w i t h the return of L o v e w i t , the master,
the fleeing of Subtle a n d D o l after
b e i n g exposed by J e r e m y w h o m a n a -
ges to clear h i m s e l f b y further d o u b l e
dealings.
A reasonable cast h a d great diffi-
c u l t y w i t h the first act w h i c h was d u l l .

m a n a g e d to s u r v i v e l o n g periods o n

t i o n m u s t be m a d e o f a certain p a r s o n ,
D e n y s Bennett, w h o stole the last
scene w i t h o u t even saying a w o r d .
T h e set was adequate a n d the re-
v o l v i n g part w o r k e d v e r y w e l l . It w a s
unfortunate that the scenery was so
stark, a trend of the m o d e r n theatre
w h i c h is not r e a l l y suitable f o r a
J a c o b e a n play.
I n c o n c l u s i o n , great credit must
go to M i k e S m i t h w h o not o n l y took
one of the m a j o r parts but also
directed the p l a y . It is sad that a l l the
effort w h i c h these few, o b v i o u s l y
dedicated, actors have put into the
play w i l l be wasted i n front of h a l f
empty houses.
