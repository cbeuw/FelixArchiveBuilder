Home Office
throws out
appeal
O N L Y T H E ISSUE of a " Limited Appeal Licence " can save
the 1966 IC Carnival Procession. This the organisers applied for on
Monday at the suggestion of the British Red Cross Society following
the Home Office rejection of their appeal against the refusal by local
police forces to authorise street collections on Saturday, 14 May.
Carnival Chairman Chris Hocking contacted the Kensington
branch of the Red Cross on Thursday to seek an alteration of the
date of their collection—10 May. However, the Red Cross appeal
is being launched over the whole South-East of England, and was
so impossible to move.
An alternative request to hold the Procession on the first Satur-
day of Carnival Week—7 May—was turned down by the Chelsea
police as another collection was scheduled for the Tuesday of that
week.
