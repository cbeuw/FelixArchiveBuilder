Heenan silent on
birth control
" H o w M A N Y people work in the
Vatican?" an American is supposed to
have asked Pope John. " About half,"
was the reply. Cardinal Heenan,
speaking at a General Studies o n the
15th, introduced his talk on the V a t i -
can Council by an analysis of this
simple but remarkable man who celled
the second Vatican Council and altered
the average Englishman's view of the
Catholic Church.
Informal
meetings
GUILDS have been having a
renewed effort this term to allow
students to meet and get to know
members of staff.
T h e y have arranged a series o f i n -
f o r m a l meetings d u r i n g M o n d a y
l u n c h - h o u r s i n t h e E l e c t r i c a l E n g i n e -
ering J u n i o r C o m m o n R o o m . O n
each occasion a staff m e m b e r has been
invited to c o m e a l o n g a n d speak,
preferably o n a topic w h i c h c o u l d
cause a b i t o f controversy.
S o f a r the meetings have been w e l l
attended, a n d several l i v e l y discus-
sions have t a k e n place. W h e t h e r they
have achieved m u c h f o r i m p r o v i n g
staff-student relations is debatable
since there w a s little o p p o r t u n i t y f o r
students t o speak t o staff personally.
Perhaps dispensing w i t h t h e speech
for some o f the meetings w o u l d i m -
prove matters.
