SECONDS SLIP BACK
U C II 2—I.C. II 0
In a hard fought game at Motspur Park, both defences played
very weD and it was not until the last minute of the first half that
either team had a clear cut shot a', goal. The I.C. forwards never
managed to penetrate the U.C. defence or to even pin them down
in their own half for any length of time. But U.C. were having a
similar problem in beating an LC. defence in which Burnett was
particularly prominent during the early part of the game.
