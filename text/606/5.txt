MORE THAN CONGRATULATIONS
W h e n y o u graduate, you'll need
more than the p r o u d smiles o f parents and
friends. Y o u ' l l need s o m e money.
Y o u ' l l need it because between
leaving college a n d p i c k i n g u p your first
salary cheque, there's a lot to pay for.
T h e deposit o n a flat, for example.
O r s o m e n e w clothes for the office.
Perhaps even a season ticket. A n d o f
course, you'll still have to eat.
If.you graduate w i t h a firm job offer,
w e can help finance this lean time.

E v e n if y o u don't have
