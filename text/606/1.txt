Spanner and Bolt
It was revealed this week that Spanner and Bolt, the mascots
of City and Guilds Union, are in the possession of IC Union
and not RCS Union, as reported in FELIX 604.
T h e deceit came to light when I C U Honorary Secretary M a r c o
L e d w o l d and I C U Deputy President Barney M c C a b e were discovered

D r R . W . Smith, College Senior Tutor, has interviewed some of the
students concerned and imposed a £50 fine on the H a l l . D r Smith and
the H a l l Committee have made it clear that they only expect those
responsible to contribute to the fine.
In a notice to the H a l l D r S m i t h stated that College is very
concerned over the unauthorised storage of explosive materials in
student residences.
A few days later another serious breach of discipline occurred in
T i z a r d H a l l . A Waitrose trolley and a chair belonging to the H a l l were
thrown from the gallery level. T h e incident occurred at 3:00am on
Wednesday, February 10, and fortunately no one was passing by at the
time. However the chair, worth £75, was irreparably broken and it has
been decided to reduce the H a l l ' s amenities budget by £75 to
compensate for this.
