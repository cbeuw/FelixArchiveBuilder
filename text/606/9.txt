D r a g o n s l a y e r (A, Matthew Robbins) in which
sorcerer's apprentice Galen (Peter MacNicol)
is called on to kill a monstrous dragon, when
his master U l r i c h (Ralph Richardson) is
prematurely killed. T h e dragon, with the
impressive name Vermithrax Pejorative, is

Casiodorus has made a deal to sacrifice virgin
maidens (selected by lottery) to save his
kingdom from the ravages of the beast.
T h e s t a r of the f i l m is u n d o u b t e d l y
Vermithrax, who was created in miniature
stop-motion animation form by Industrial Light
and M a g i c (who s u p p l i e d effects for The
Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost
Ark) and in full scale by the Disney studios.
The problem is that the impressive dragon is
only matched by Sir Ralph Richardson as
.Ulrich, the other actors (especially the two
leads) being fairly weak. The story is cluttered
and confused and really could have been a lot
better. Nevertheless, it has a few inspired
moments and is certainly entertaining.
The best release of recent weeks in my
opinion is Lawrence Kasdan's B o d y H e a t
starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.
This is a stylish murder story in which Ned
Recine, a seedy lawyer, falls for the wife of a
rich man whom they then kill. N o w this theme
is all too familiar, but this film succeeds where
many others (notably The Postman Always
Rings Twice) failed. The setting is excellent
and the script convincing, if a little cliched at
times.
Sir Ralph Richardson as Ulrich in Dragonslayer and Kathleen Turner in Bodyheat.
Kasdan has deliberately produced a tribute
to film noir and evokes memories of such
classics as The Big Sleep. By adding a more
s e n s u a l (even erotic) a p p r o a c h he has
successfully updated the genre. I found it an
intriguing, exciting film.
F a n s of h a r d action will enjoy M i c h a e l
Winner's D e a t h W i s h II (X, Leicester Square
Theatre) in which Charles Bronson once more
dons his donkey jacket and woolly hat to wage
a private war against crime.
The original Death Wish was a violent and
impressive film, whose vigilante hero was
cheered by cinema audiences in America. The
"Gee Aimer, what quaint lit'l of back streets
are 'round here " I overheard from a middle-
aged A m e r i c a n couple as we were being

of Aussies' awfully austere accents.
O n this, the opening night of M r Humphries'
presentation of ten weeks of A u s t r a l i a n
culture, many of the world's most eminent
dignitories were present in the audience, David
Steel, Barry Norman and M r s Iris Clissold
(mind you, little movements in the 'Royal Box'
convinced me that there was indeed an affinity
of some sort between certain 'people' in the
front of the H o u s e and a certain person
backstage).
We were shown to our seats, but due to an
unforunate series of accidents earlier on with
the rehearsal audience each seat had to be
sprayed with an air freshener by our charming
usherette.
The lights dimmed, the band began and the
evening's euphoria forced itself upon us with
Sir Leslie Colin Patterson (Cultural Attache to
the Court of St. James) stately circling the
stage. To come in late while Sir Les is in mid-

climbing, because let's face it, you're either
going to be picked on or spat on whichever
comes first. Sir Les is the epitomy of the
Down-under emprisario—and the more that
you listen to him, the more you get the feeling
that Australian culture has something to offer
us—what it is, is a matter of your own taste
and of Sir Les' bad taste. He seems to have
problems relating to which side he "dresses
on" and it certainly sticks out in his "gouchy,
appeal has waned a little and the violence has
become more explicit, but the story is really
the same. Paul Kersey has moved from New
Y o r k to Los Angeles and his daughter and
housekeeper are killed after muggers raid his
home. This sets Kersey out on another spree
of revenge killings, bringing his own retribution
where police methods fail.
Bronson holds the film together, but apart
from him the cast are fairly dull. Jill Ireland as
his unconvincing lover is particularly wooden.
The feeling of subdued elation as Bronson
corners and kills the assailants remains, but
the film offers nothing more than the original.

rapport with the audience grows, as it seems
does the side on w h i c h he dresses! H i s
constant imbibing of the odd Scotch or twelve
allow his words to reach the "paupers" in the
'Gods' on the wings of his saliva. With a song
and dance routine reminiscent of 'Skippy' and
the Australian ballet he made his exit.
Phil Philby, introduced by Barry Norman as
"the leading innovator of non-mainstream
Australian cineaste" talked to us about his
latest film 'Cage of Darkness'. Made on a
modest grant of l ' ^ m from the Australian Arts
Council the film we learn is "poetically shot,
tastefully recreating the torment of two lesbian
aborignes in an ail female Australian prison".
T h e girls are p l a y e d m a s t e r l y by J o a n
Sutherland and Yvonne Goolagong and the
part of the leather-clad binocularised warder
by Olivia Newton-John. This was a superb
cameo piece and developed into one of the
evening's highlights as Phil satirised most of
the problems associated with the Southern
continent's film industry.
Sandy Stone (which I believe to be M r
H u m p h r i e s ' greatest creation) is a p o o r ,
dejected man, permanently reflecting on his
life gone by in a m o n o t o n e v o i c e . T h e
monologues associated with Sandy reveal
much about suburban life Down Under, the
Tupperware parties, looking after the kids of
Valda Clissold and revealing just how boring
life in the suburbs can be. Y o u must be
prepared to listen to Sandy because under that
dressing gown, pajamas and hot watter bottle
facade there lingers a very moving but deeply,
deeply funny character.
Dame Edna takes up the entire second half
of the evening's entertainment reducing (in her
Gallipoli tights) most of the front rows to
