lecture to the M i c r o C l u b last

Jumbo Success!
O V E R 200 P E O P L E were mesmerised by hypnotist extraordinaire
M a r t i n S. T a y l o r , and the hilariously funny antics of his seventeen
volunteers at the H . G . Wells Society lecture o n M o n d a y night.
After a preliminary talk o n the history of hypnotism a n d life of
Mesmer, M r T a y l o r began the long awaited demonstration. M a r t i n
placed the seventeen volunteers into a hypnotic trance. T o test their
level .of consciousness M a r t i n read out details o f President Reagan's
defence policy which caused the volunteers to fall about in hysterics of
laughter—but then so d i d many of the audience.

O t h e r stunts included persuading the Wellsoc C h a i r m a n , M r Pallab
Ghosh, to deliver a very m o v i n g speech, with all the wit and powers of
oratory at his disposal (not much-Ed) using only the first few letters of
the alphabet.
T h e highlight of the evening was when M a r t i n placed a post-
hypnotic suggestion in a young lady that she would see an elephant in
the lecture theatre when he said the words "meet J u m b o " . W h e n he
repeated the phrase her immediate reaction, after turning completely-
white, was " h o w the hell did you get that thing in here?"
A very entertaining evening was rounded off nicely with a showing
of a video tape ol'Not The Nine O'ClockNews w h i c h people at the lecture
would have missed.
Next M o n d a y Wellsoc will be showing the film Freaks. T h i s writer
for one will not be missing this rare opportunity to see this very weird
film.
