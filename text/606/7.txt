Bookshop News
I am sorry for any inconvenience caused by the lack of laboratory
books. The specialist company that produces them had our order
on June 9 1981. I personally placed it in the marketing manager's
hot sweaty hand and to date we still have not had them. However,
I have managed to get an alternative which may not be approved
by your tutor, i.e. the graph is on right and lines on left, though the
principle is the same. If I may request a small favour: if you all
would write to our supplier bemoaning the fact that our lab.
books have not appeared, 1 would be most grateful. Their address
is: E.S.A. Creative Learning L t d , Fairview Road, Stevenage,
Herts.

CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
Left Alliance
Over the past three weeks, joint meetings have been held between IC
Labour Club, Liberal Club and Socialist Society to see how they could
work together to greater effect within Imperial College. It was found that
within IC there was a great deal of common ground and general
agreement was reached that there aims could be better achieved by
concerted campaigns involving members from all three societies. To this
end an informal 'left alliance' is now in existence and to get the alliance off
to a start it has been agreed to launch an anti-apartheid campaign along
with Anti-Apartheid Society in order to make people more aware of the
atrocities of apartheid, (e.g. Sharpville massacre, internment without trail
occupation of Namibia by South African forces; repression of black and
coloured South Africans in all walks of life), and to try and stop the
involvement of IC staff and students in the apartheid regime, i.e.
commitment to having no more South African students on nuclear
technology courses and the end to a careers forum for companies like
Rio Tinto Zinc which is involved in Namibia. So far the IC left alliance
has been well supported and it is hoped that everyone in College will be
able to contribute to the campaign against apartheid. The next meeitng of
the alliance will be on Thursday, February 25, 1:00pm, Union Senior
Common Room.
Pimlico Connection
The Pimlico Connection was set up six years ago, as a tutoring scheme
with the idea of increasing the communication of scientific ideas. Then,
the numbers involved could be counted on one hand, now nearly ninety
Imperial College students travel out to five local schools.
Subjects Tutored
Science at all levels, but mainly pre O Level.
Engineering—mainly woodwork and metalwork. Students with individual
workshop experience especially appreciated.
Mathematics at ail levels.
Electronics—mainly at C S E Level.
Approximately 13:30 to 15:30 each Wednesday afternoon in the autumn
term and first four weeks of the spring term.
Travel expenses are paid. No previous experience needed.
If you would like to find out more, then come along (with no strings
attached!) to Elec Eng 606 at 12:30 on Tuesday, February 23. A pay-as-
you-eat lunch will be provided and you can chat to students involved this
year.
However, if you cannot make it, then contact Sinclair Goodlad EE501
(int 3080), Tony Potter C h e m Eng 3, or John Hughes EE2.
ICU Handbook
Articles are now being accepted for the next U n i o n
Handbook. All club, society and C C U articles must be
handed in before the deadline. Any articles from Council
should also be in before the deadline which is Friday, April
30; i.e. the first Friday of the summer term.
Contributions should be placed in the Handbook Box on
the noticeboard beside the stairs in the FELIX Office.
It is up to clubs and societies to appoint someone to write
their article if their elections have not taken place before the
deadline.
Anyone who is interested in writing/compiling guides is
asked to discuss them with the Editor before starting.
Contributions should be printed (or typed) on one side of
the paper and handed in as soon as possible.

SF Soc
Back in 1981 John Sladek initiated
the S F Soc series of visits by
authors to College. Scant months
ago Barrington Bayley became
author number two. O n Thursday,
February 25, Chris Priest comes
to the Senior C o m m o n Room in
the Union Building, and the series
of visits can now justifiably be
c a l l e d that. M r P r i e s t ' s m a i n
peculiarity as an author is that
each book he writes is better than
the one before. Anyone who has
read Inverted World, Indoctrinaire,
Fugue for a Darkening World, A
Dream of IVessex, The Space
Machine, An Infinite Sumemr,
The Affirmation or e v e n the
Lesbian House is sure to want to
come. So join the groupies at one
o'clock at the venue previously
mentioned if you want to see the
greatest living English S F writer in
the flesh (sorry Brain, sorry J . G . ,
I'm sure you don't mind Russell).
O K , I know John Brunner's still
alive, but I do have to limit the
length of this bulletin you know,
can't mention everyone, what do
you want blood?
Also coming soon, The Big Bus,
but more of that some other time,
and on March 23 an event to finish
off those who survived Relativity
and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
Author's note: any mistakes in the
spelling of this article are nothing
to do with me. Yours straining for
the optimum.
