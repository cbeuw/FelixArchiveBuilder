centrally heated and the standards of decoration and furnishings are

GERRARD MANSIONS
Gerrard Mansions
This block contains five flats each comprising two single bedrooms,
kitchen/diner and bathroom. They were originally let unfurnished and
have been furnished by the present tenants with varying degrees of
success!
Situated in the heart of Chinatown, they are, to say the least, exotic. If
you are considering applying for these flats you would be well advised to
discuss the implications with the Student Services Officer.

85 LEXHAM GARDENS
85 Lexham Gardens
The three flats in this little known corner of the Head Tenancies
encapsulate an air of spaciousness and gracious charm which is far
removed from the sometimes brash conversions to be encountered in the
rest of Lexham Gardens.
One of the flats would particularly suit a group of four which contains a
couple.
