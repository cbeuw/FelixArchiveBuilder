A n estimated 30,000 attendance caused slight
congestion in the range today, attracted by
the l u r e o f I m p e r i a l ' s t o p m a r k s m e n i n
action. Early excitement was provided by
the a r r i v a l o f the l o v e l y H e l e n , w h i c h
prompted Steve to drop a shot o r two. T h e
excuse book soon appeared as some low
scores expressed concern over T i m ' s moans ol
ecstasy, the pressure wave so caused being
t h o u g h t to deflect b u l l e t s f r o m t h e i r
theoretical trajectory. It is hoped that club
captain Denis Sleath (contact via M e c h E n g
letter-racks) will appear in time to lead his
team to Wednesday's annual dinner.

H a v i n g arrived on the planet Creightonia, the
twelve man mission from the I C federation
left their transports to find a region of very
little vegetation and hostile natives. In order
to subdue the population sub-lieutentant
Sharpe was despatched to mount a one-man
offensive on the opposition's flank which
resulted in a confrontation with the neutral
arbitrator. After struggling for sometime i n

proportions, awarding a penalty to his own
side, only to redeem himself minutes later by
zapping Sharpe with a yellow card!
Sharpc returned from his live minutes in
hyperspace just iii time to see crew members
Wylie (from the N o r t h Eastern quadrant)
and Pithketly complete the rout with well
taken chances. Wr

protests were l o d g e d as to t h e a l l e g e d

Last Thursday night saw our intrepid team of
alcoholics a n d masochists go into action
again, this time against Guy's Hospital in a
U L U League match.
The game started well enough, despitejim
Boucher's tendency to pass the ball daintily
to the opposition, and three goals soon came,
from Leach, Boucher and Casini. However,
the effort of dragging our beer guts around
the pool then proved too much, a n d we
conceded three goals due to lousy m a r k i n g
and bad covering.
In the last few minutes, Barry A s h w i n
scored, which partly made u p for his earlier
fumbling, and then R i c h Leach put in an
impressive back Hip, having decided to miss
an easy goal with his first shot and bounce it
oil' the post instead.
The final result, 5-3, added another win to
our unbeaten record in the U L U League,
and we celebrated with the usual vast
quantity of Fosters.

Bowling
O n Wednesday February 10 eight teams
c o n t e s t e d t h e a n n u a l C C U b o w l i n g
c h a m p i o n s h i p . A f t e r a t i t a n i c s t r u g g l e
throughout the day, the Guilds A team (alias
C h e m E n g 2) of A . M c M u l l a n d , W . M a n
a n d N . G r i m w o o d held o f a last gasp
challenge from M . Smith, B. T h o n g and K .
Short who made up the R C S A team, to take
the shield for the third year running. In third
place came the R S M team of R . Cook. A .
Davis and D . L a m p , the first Mines team to
compete for many years (at least two).
Eight IC bowlers trooped oil'to Portsmouth
last Sunday to take part in the Pompey
Quads. The A team (Ray Cook, Chris Wells,
M a r t i n H a r r i s o n , W a i M a n ) b o w l e d
disappointingly although there were one or
two good individual games. The B team (Jeff
Q u i n n , Dave Smith, A n d y Davis, K e v i n
Short) performed much better with all four
bowling well above average. Due to the rail
strike the I C eight had to leave early before
the final scores had been totalled so at the
time of writing it was not known who the
overall winners were, but with a total of 2336
the B team must have been i n with an
excellent chance. O n e result that we did find
out was that Davis and Short took third place-
in the handicap series of the double section,
but unfortunately for them they did not get
any trophies.

After some difficulty in finding their o w n
s a i l i n g c l u b , Essex d e m o n s t r a t e d t h e i r
superior a l l round ability by beating us
convincingly. T h e first race started with
M i l l s and Kennedy on the line at the gun,
and some heated short tacking resulted in
Kennedy giving a green to the opposition.
However, this form was not to last for long
and Essex were in a commanding position by
the first mark. The race was a foregone-
conclusion with Essex finishing 1, 2, 5 and I C
3, 4, 6.
A n epic start by Bennet in the second race-
was unfortunately to no avail and the choice
of the wrongside of the beat put h i m to the
back of the fleet. M i l l s a n d K e n n e d y ,
however, in hot pursuit round the second
windward mark started to pick off the Iissex
tail-enders, but left it too late a n d were
robbed of victory on the finishing line.
Despite another excellent start in the first
race against U L I I , the team couldn't keep it
up and having been 1, 2, 6 at the first mark,
had dropped to 1, 5, 6 by the third and
finished in these positions.
In the second race M i l l s ' surprise tactics
s u r p r i s e d e v e n h i m s e l f as he c o l l i d e d
u n i n t e n t i o n a l l y w i t h t h e o p p o s i t i o n .
Kennedy managed to get himself involved in
a mass pile u p at the third mark, hit it and
had to re-round. Bennet skilfully kept out of
trouble at the hack of the lleet. U L I I thus
clinched victory finishing 1,2, 3 with I C 4, 5,
6.
