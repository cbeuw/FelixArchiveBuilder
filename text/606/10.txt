Audience participation is the feature of the
show and I'm the last person to give away any
of the secrets, you'll have to jog around to
Drury Lane and buy your own way in, but one
thing I will say is that there are gladdies, and
they appear in their hundreds.
W h e n we all left the theatre for the tube

arms full of gladdies the old station brought
back memories of the O l d G a r d e n and I do

Operation Bad Apple by G.F. Newman.
Directed by Max Stafford-Clark, Royal
Court Theatre
Operation Bad Apple, by the novelist and
scriptwriter G . F . N e w m a n , is about police
corruption. N e w m a n first achieved prominence
with a series of tough but realistic police
novels, but in 1978 his four television films
forming the basis of Law and Order were
t r a n s m i t t e d b y t h e B B C a n d g e n e r a t e d
considerable critical acclaim and no small
measure of controversy. Operation Bad Apple
is his first stage play.
The play examines the inside world of the
Metropolitan Police. A n outside police force
investigates possible corruption in the Met in
order to throw out the 'odd bad apple in an
otherwise sound barrel'. A big fish is netted,
becomes a n informant, and in his naming a
huge number of corrupt policemen it turns out
that no less than ninety-five per cent of the
C I D is corrupt. A t this point the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General
d e c i d e at a golfing m a t c h that e n o u g h is
enough. T h e extetit of corruption must not
leak out to the general public otherwise a
complete breakdown of law and order would
ensue together with a bringing down of the
government in office. Therefore only a handful
of policemen would be brought to trial.
Whether the C I D is really as corrupt (and
corrupt in its higher echelons) as Newman
would suggest is of course open to debate. But
more importantly perhaps the play throws up
uncomfortable questions about society itself.
Is society not hypocritical in demanding a
police force that gives results and that is at the
same time free from corruption when society
itself is corrupt? It is even possible that the
police force is more corrupt than other public
organizations because the opportunity tor
corruption is so much greater.
T h e play d o e s have i t s faults b u t it is
nevertheless a tense, gripping and hard-hitting
piece of narrative drama that is well worth
seeing. T h e theatre is very close to Sloane
Square tube station, and seats a n d standby i
tickets are very modestly priced. T h e playf
ends o n M a r c h 27.

Clarke's name is printed in large letters on the
cover of the book, even though he's written
only a n introduction and short commentaries
after each chapter. In the same way as in the

The Forest by Alexander Ostrovsky in a
new translation by Jeremy Brooks and
Kitty Hunter Blair. Directed by Adrian
Noble, the Royal Shakespeare Company
at the Aldwych Theatre.
The highly acclaimed production of The Forest
returns to the Aldwych Theatre after sell-out
seasons at the Warehouse a n d the Other
Place (in Stratford). Written in 1871, The
Forest is considered to be one of Ostrovsky's
masterpieces. Although virtually unknown in
this country Ostrovsky is acknowledged as
one of Russia's leading playwrights and his
plays (he wrote forty-eight) are still very much
a part of the Russian repertoire today.

crossroads in a forest. They stand beneath a
signpost that points towards 'the estate of M r s
Goormizkskaya'. S h e is the tragedian's aunt,
the estate t h e s c e n e of a l l his c h i l d h o o d
memories. It is the encounter of these two life-
h a r d e d a c t o r s w i t h t h e d e c o r o u s a n d
hypocritical provincial 'society' that provides
much of the comedy and the moral core of the
play. T h e play's characters are a marvellous
array of highly amusing, colourful and effusive
individuals. T h e play reflects O s t r o v s k y ' s
lifelong love of the theatre, his respect for
actors and his understanding that we all (and
particularly the upper classes) get trapped to
some extent in the roles in which we have
chosen to cast ourselves.
The remaining performances of the play,
which I recommend highly, run from February
24 to 17. Standbys are available.

books, five out of the twelve commentaries
contain plugs for his o w n stories.
The book itself is fairly boring with far too
m a n y u n i n t e r e s t i n g a n d m i n o r m y s t e r i e s
diluting the more spectacular ones. "Strangest
of all these (objects turning up in unexpected
places) is undoubtedly the collection of ancient
Chinese porcelain seals found all over Ireland
in the late 18th and 19th centuries". Trivia like
that fill up most of the book, but there are
interesting chapters such as the one about the
explosion in Siberia in 1908. If they'd cut about
two hundred pages, the book would have been
worth reading, but in it's present form it isn't
worth the price.
