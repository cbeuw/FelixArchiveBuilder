Very soon you'll be faced with lots of articles which begin "I expect by
now you're getting bored with articles which begin " Yes folks, if you
haven't noticed already, election time is with us. In connection with this
annual event (which occurs every year) the IC Radio Breakfast Show
(Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 8:00-9:15am) is taking an in-depth
look at election fever, how to catch it, who to give it to when you've got it
and what antidotes are available for it.
Boredom
All election candidates are invited to make promotions, which must be
less than a minute long, that will be broadcast regularly on the air to
convince everyone that they're not really boring Union hacks. IC Radio
personnel are available to assist with the technicalities of the production,
but candidates should have an idea of what they want to say. It usually
takes about an hour to produce a promotion—less time than pasting up a
poster. Prospective sabbaticals should get in touch with IC Radio (int
3440) as soon as possible to avoid a last minute rush (studio time is
limited to 24 hours each day). Promotions will be broadcast from the
evening papers come down whether or not all the candidates have
bothered to make one (or more).
A p a t h y
The almost legendary IC Radio election programmes make their return
to the airwaves at the end of 'Hustings Week'. They are broadcast live
from one of the College bars (usually Southside, now known as 'Harry's
Bar'), and give any members of the Union who come along to the bar the
opportunity of asking the candidates lots of embarrassing questions.
E l e c t i o n c a n d i d a t e s a r e r e m i n d e d to p r e p a r e t h e m s e l v e s
psychologically for the programmes, which are an excellent way of reach-
ing some of the apathetic majority of voters.
Why Bother?
Remember, if you want to get involved in IC Radio, either to pursue your
creativeness in the technical department or become a presenter and
realise your potential as a megastar, it is not too late. New recruits are
always welcome; indeed, in the past fortnight, two novice presenters (a
local euphemism for DJs) have taken to the airwaves, you could join
them!
Anti-Apartheid
Group
P e r h a p s there are still people
around who don't know that 1982
is the U N International Year for
the M o b i l i s a t i o n of S a n c t i o n s
against South Africa. Well—it is!
So, the Anti-Apartheid Group
will be b u s y r u n n i n g a r o u n d
picketting any company that is
heavily linked with South Africa,
and that is visiting College on the
milk-round.
Also there will be a national
march, campaigning for sanctions;
this will be on Sunday, M a r c h 14.

Snooker
O n another of those hot steamy
nights in the Snooker R o o m last
week, the C team beat the B team
3-2 and the A team scraped home
against Bedford 5-0.
C team stars were Kruszewski,
Jennings and some bloke called
Holt who seems to be appearing
with s o m e regularity in these
c o l u m n s . B t e a m h o n o u r was
upheld by Wright and Gannuray.
W e had the most welcome sight
of a female player amongst the
B e d f o r d t e a m , a n d S i m p k i n
s u f f e r e d n u m e r o u s n e r v o u s
d i s o r d e r s b e f o r e b e a t i n g h e r ,
albeit with dirty tactics such as
k i c k i n g h e r d r i n k o v e r . T h i s
victory must put the A team on
top of the league, with the B team
in second place.
W e had an upset in the handicap
tournament last week when the
little-known Nicolaides shattered
C P . Tripp's dream of doing the
double. This competition is now
t o t a l l y u n p r e d i c t a b l e a n d i t ' s
anybody's guess (or bet) as to
who's going to win.

Braving the pages of FELIX, the
Methsoc publicity team (having

relearning how to write) announce

C h e m Eng Theatre 1 as usual.
This follows our most successful
talk yet, when lan Ross entertained
and informed at least fifty people
in C h e m E n g T h e a t r e 1 last
Friday. He gave a brief synopsis of
how he became B B C Industry
Correspondent ("I didn't have the
brains to go to the Bar"), then
pointed out a heavy bias through-
out the B r i t i s h m e d i a towards
reporting mainly industrial disputes
("Editors like a good punch-up!")

Definitely a monster event, and
thanks to those who came along.
