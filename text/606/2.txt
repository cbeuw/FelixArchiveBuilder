Dear Mark
Y o u know that I did not
like the way you started the
ball rolling on your electoral
soapbox series. A n d you know
I had one or two reservations
a b o u t e q u a l access to a l l
candidates. But when all is
said and done it would seem
to be a marvellous idea.
I have just read the articles
in F E L I X 605. L a u g h ? I
nearly shat!

Dear Mr Smith
As Council's representative
on the Bar Committee, I feel I
must c o r r e c t some o f the
i d i o t i c b l a b b e r i n g s o f M r
Goulder that appeared in last
week's F E L I X .
T h e B a r Committee has
never, ever, even considered
c o n t e m p l a t i n g a n y t h i n g
remotely resembling a bust of
P r i n c e A l b e r t . I c a n only
think that this is some kind of
joke, as no one would take
such a suggestion seriously.
T h e Victorian prints men-
tioned are believed to be in
the possession of the College
archives, a n d therefore will
cost us nothing.
T h e Bar Committe minutes
are, of course, available for
scrutiny in the U n i o n Office.
It is a pity he did not bother
to read them.

Dear Mark
It came to my notice that
last F r i d a y ( F e b r u a r y 12)
everyone who attended the
previous S C C meeting was
invited by Steve Goulder to
an S C C booze-up to 'cele-
brate' sixty years of S C C .
M e m b e r s o f the U n i o n
might be interested to know
that this cost Â£ 2 0 o f their
money, not much, but ima-
gine it similarly irresponsible
people were to be elected to
run I C U n i o n next year. H o w
m u c h more o f our money
could be wasted giving hacks
free food and wine?
E v e n t h e C h a i r m a n o f
L a b o u r C l u b w h e n asked
agreed that it was a waste of
money, but said he didn't
intend to do anything about it
because he fancied a free
party.
I hope that perhaps F E L I X
will i n future attempt to tell
people when similar events
are organised and hopefully
prevent these U n i o n parasites
from having such a good time
at our expense.
With love
. Ian Hodgson
E d ' s N o t e :
Considering that M r Hodgson
is personally responsible for a
great deal of the trouble I C
R a g is n o w i n , I f i n d i t
absolutely incredible that he
dare criticise anybody. H i s
pathetic performance as I C
R a g C h a i r m a n has resulted in
the loss of thousands of pounds
to I C R a g , so how he can
h o n e s t l y l a b e l p e o p l e as
irresponsible for spending a
t w e n t y p o u n d a l l o w a n c e
(which is specifically reserved
for e n t e r t a i n m e n t ) amazes
Dear Mark
In his Welfare Week article
in the last F E L I X , Nick Pyne
m e n t i o n e d t h a t there are
"probably 500 gays at I C " , a
figure p r e s u m a b l y d e r i v e d
from the notion that 5% of the
adult population of Britain is
exclusively homosexual.
W i t h o u t w i s h i n g to cast
doubt on this widely believed
s t a t i s t i c , m a y I ask f o r a
serious answer to an obvious
question: how does anyone
know?

Dear Mr Smith
I as the former I C Enter-
tainments Committee Disco
Officer wish to announce my
formal resignation from the
post.
I have submitted the major
reasons for my resignation in
a letter to the entertainments
committee. These are of a
personal nature and are of no
interest to your readers. I
would however like bring to
your attention some general
points which have disturbed
me w h i l s t I have been a
m e m b e r of the E n t e r t a i n -
ments Committee.
The Ents Committee does
not serve the musical taste of
students at IC. The decisions
in booking bands are taken by
one person alone w i t h no
consultation with the other
members of the committee,
and this of course leads to a
great emphasis on this one
person's own taste in music
which I do not think conforms
with that of the majority ofTC
students. The way he covers
up for this is by claiming that
I C students, as a whole, have
no taste. I illustrate my point
by bringing to the attention of
IC students (as if they hadn't
noticed) the lack of variety in
the b a n d s b o o k e d . W h e n
' O v e r k i l l ' played here the
lack of enthusiasm shown by
l e a d i n g m e m b e r s o f t h e
c o m m i t t e e was b l a n t e n t l y
obvious a n d as no attempt
was made to fully promote the
band the event was not an
"overwhelming success".
I would like to point out
that the Ents Committee are
n o w i n a s u i t a b l y s o u n d
financial position to be able to
underwrite a major band to
play at C o l l e g e . H o w e v e r ,
when the opportunity arose to
book such a band at a very
reasonable price no attempt
was made by the C h a i r m a n to
take up the offer, despite its
approval by the Entertain-
ments C o m m i t t e e , a n d he
delayed making a decision for
so l o n g t h a t t h e b a n d i n
q u e s t i o n e v e n t u a l l y lost
interest and in the end did not
wish to play the gig. T h e
band to which I refer is K i n g
Crimson. Instead the Chair-
man went ahead and booked
a lesser band of his own choice
for that date, a deal which
later fell through, so now I C
students will not see a major
band performing at T H E I R
College this year, while the
Ents Committee enjoy a large
profit.

Dear Mark
I have been moved to write
to you to complain about the
posters publicising the Links
Carnival. They feature the IC
Radio logo with the word
"Radio"' cut off. While we
have no copyright o n the
artwork, we feel that such use
of our logo, especially the I C
R a d i o c r o c o d i l e , is v e r y
impolite, particularly since
thev did not seek our permis-
sion.
Jeremy Nunns
Secretary. I C Radio
Sir
I would be grateful for the
opportunity to throw some
light on the mystery of the IC
Radio crocodile logo. For if it
is true that they do not possess
the copyright, then I can only
assume that they themselves
have ripped it off without due
acknowledgement or permis-
sion and are in no position to-
criticise the Links Carnival
publicity.
More likely, they do possess
the copyright, as copyright
does not need to be registered,
unlike a patent, and the Links
Carnival publicity machine
may be duly chastised.
