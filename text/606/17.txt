L E X H A M GARDENS
Lexham Gardens lies between Gloucester Road and Earls Court, ten to
fifteen minutes walk from College. The five houses there which come
under the Lexham Gardens scheme are numbers 25, 48, 54, 79 and 81.
Numbers 48 and 54 consist mainly of double flatlets each with its own
bathroom and kitchen area. There are also a couple of larger flats, some
single bedsits with their own cooking facilities and use of a shared
bathroom, and a few self-contained single flats. Numbers 25, 79 and 81
are divided into flats for three, four, five, six and eight. A s a rule they
don't have a lounge although some have large kitchens which can be
used as 'kitchen diners'. Also, they are more expensive than the Hamlet
Gardens flats. At the same time the standard of decoration is much
higher than you would normally expect to find. The flats in 25, 79 and 81
are centrally heated whereas the ones in 48 and 54 are not.
SINCLAIR GARDENS
Situated close to Holland Road and Shepherds Bush underground
station are two houses each containing a flat for eight and one for five.
The flats for eight are particularly attractive as they are on two floors and
have a large lounge and two bathrooms. All the flats here are modernised
to a high standard.
