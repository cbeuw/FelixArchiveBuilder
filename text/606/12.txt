Election Publicity
I would like to remind all election candidates
that, as announced in F E L I X 601, the last date
on which I will accept completed posters or
h a n d o u t s f o r p r i n t i n g will be M o n d a y ,
February 22. After that financial penalties will
be imposed and I cannot guarantee that they
will be done on time, or even at all.
Election Manifestoes
Papers for the sabbatical posters come down
on Friday, February 26.
Manifestoes for inclusion in F E L I X must
reach me personally at the office by 1:00pm on
Monday, M a r c h 1 for inclusion on Friday,
M a r c h 5. T h e s e will be c u t at the three
hundreth word.
If y o u wish to have a photo accompanying
your manifesto it must be a fairly large black
a n d white print. T h i s (or a n y alternative
representation of your visage) must reach me
at the same time. Colour pictures or slides are
absolutely no use.
Elections for the posts will be by campus-
wide ballot on Monday and Tuesday, M a r c h 8
and 9.
Freaks
I have received eight letters complaining about
the fact that the H . G . Wells Society will be
showing T o d d Browning's Freaks on Monday
evening. They describe the film as sick and
depraved.
It is true that the film was banned in this
c o u n t r y for over thirty years a n d that it
mmmmEi
W h e n people comment on my column in
F E L I X , they usually describe the puzzles as
'mathematical'. But considering that nearly
half of the students at IC are engineers, it
seems only fair to occasionally steer away from
the abstract whimsy of mathematical logic and
venture into the real world
Y o u are given four dominoes which are to
be arranged in a pile overhanging the straight
e d g e of a t a b l e . W h a t is t h e m a x i m u m
horizontal overhang you can achieve? The
dominoes must all be horizontal with their long
sides parallel to the edge of the table, and of
course, the whole thing must remain in stable
equilibrium.
The longest sides of a domino are two
inches long, so with your solution please
include both a diagram and a clear statement
of the overhang it produces. I've no idea what
the maximum possible value is (although if you
can't manage more than two inches you're not
really trying) so the prize will go to the best
solution received by the closing date.
Finally, as I said, this is an engineering
problem and I recommend that you approach
it experimentally using paperback books, or
playing cards or even dominoes.
contains a large number of real life freaks, but
these people cannot have seen the film. It is a
fascinating and disturbing story set in a circus
where the freaks exact cruel revenge for being
wronged. Although quite macabre, it is a
sensitive and worthwhile film. I recommend
you to take advantage of this rare opportunity
to see such an interesting movie.
The film will be shown at 7:30pm in Elec Eng
408 on Monday evening.

Last Week's Solution
H , L , O , Q , T pure; M , N , P , R, S applied.
Write ' L ' for 'statement made by L is true'
and ' L " for 'statement made by L is false'. Then
we have:
L: If H ' then ( M and N')
O: H if and only if (P' and Q)
R: (P' and R') if and only if M
N : M or S
Q: S' or L ' or O '
M : M if and only if O
T: If T then (S' and L ' and H')'
P: Over half true
S: Over half false
M ' implies O , and M implies O . S o O . Now,
considering T's statement, the assumption T '
i m p l i e s T (see note b e l o w ) w h i c h is a
contradiction. S o T is true. N o w assume S. S
implies N , and since (from S) at least six are
false, only S, N , T , and O are true. But this
implies Q . S o S is false after all, and so Q is
true. N o w for L's statement to be false, H must
be false t o o (see note a g a i n ) . B u t this
contradicts T which we know to be true. S o L
is true. F r o m N ' s statement ( M and N') must
be false, so H ' is false too, i.e. H is true. S o P '
and Q (from O). A n d to make P false, both R
and M must be false also.

Nearly all the confusion arose from the
possibility of 'if X then Y ' being false. The only
way 'if X then Y ' can be false is for X to be true
and Y false. A s an example of this, consider
the first 'if-then' clause ever formulated: 'if you
taste the fruit of the tree you shall surely die'.
The only way you can give the lie to this
statement is by tasting the fruit and not dying.
Y o u cannot make the statement false if you do
not taste the fruit. S o when L e n said 'If the
head is applied ' for his statement to be
false, the head would have to be applied.
One person criticised me for setting a puzzle
which depended on this principle, but I don't
think I was unfair, particularly since I have
explained it in detail before, albeit a long time
ago (November 21, 1980, to be exact).
Finally, another correspondent asked for a
return to 'the good old days when all your
puzzles were of this type'. I thought you
preferred a more varied diet, but if you have
strong feelings—write!
