Manny Get
£ Your Gun
In the week that the British Government announces a £ 1 ! 2
billion budget for university research into the US Strategic
Defence Initiative, members of the Department of
Computing at IC have sent petitions to the Prime Minister
and the Financial Times, in which they disassociate
themselves from the project. They urge the Government to
follow suit.
In defending their
opinions, the academics
have expressed concern
that SDI will divert
resources away from the
rejuvenation of British
industry, and that it could
lead to a new 'Star Wars'
arms race between East
and West. The petitions
refer to a set of papers by
Professor David Parnas, an
ex-member of the SDI
panel on 'Computing in
Support of Battle
Management'. Professor
Parnas' report claim that
SDI is not only unreliable
and untrustworty, but is an
impossible task to realise.
Professor Manny
Lehman, the IC Academic
whose research contract
sparked off the
controversy, told FELIX
that his views do not differ
greatly from those of his
colleagues. Reiterating his
belief that the research will
provide scientific proof
detrimental to the future of
SDI, Professor Lehman
stated that his work was
not specifically on SDI, and
that ignorance of software
technology was a greater
threat to mankind than the
nuclear arms race.
Head of Department,
Bruce Sayers told FELIX
that he didn't support SDI
because it diverted
resources away from the
Alvey resource work which
in his view is more
important to the UK.
On Thursday, STOIC
organised a debate
between Professors
Lehman and Kowalski.
Professor Lehman stressed
again that he was not
building components of the
'Star Wars' system. His
contract was to investigate
the software technology
necessary for such a
programme . He was
adamant that the system
was not viable, saying that
'Software of the size and
complexity necessary to
achieve the SDI target
clearly can not be built'.
Professor Lehman also
aired his views on 'software
Pollution' claiming that
errors in software that did
not show up until program
execution are potentially
the most dangerous part of
the system.
Professor Kowalski was
concerned that SDI will
take funds away from
economically useful
research. He also said that
the result of investigative
studies of SDI should make
the political leadership of
the world realise that it is
impossible, but these
results could be dismissed
as motivated by left wing
politics.
True Grit
Proposals to extract a layer
of gravel from beneath the
IC playing field at
Harlington are to be
implemented when
planning permission is
obtained. Henry Streeter
(Sand and Ballast) Ltd, the
company which has been
mining the gravel on a site
adjacent to the playing
fields, has accepted a
tender from College to
carry out the work.
The Union is arranging a
meeting with College to
discuss the matter. A C C
chairman Simon Errington
is concerned that there will
not be sufficent space
remaining for IC sports
clubs once the work
begins.
Reeves Flushed
College Security Officer,
Geoff Reeves, confirmed
this week that he had been
soaked. In his weekly
bulletin on the soaking
situation, Mr Reeves said
that £50 of clothing had
been damaged by the
Soaker and that he would
make the Soaker replace
the clothing when he
caught him. Mr Reeves has
set up a soaker hotline on
3371.
Breakfast In Beit
A group of QT members appeared outside the Union
building to eat breakfast yesterday lunchtime. To avoid
being recognised they wore pyjamas, dressing-gowns,
slippers and sunglasses (a QT trademark). While reading
the morning papers they ate cornflakes, followed by coffee
and biscuits.
A QT Spokesman contacted FELIX later, 'claiming
irresponsibility for the event'. He said an Annual Dinner
was too expensive nowadays and this event provided good
value at a fraction of the cost. He went on to warn of the
danger of jumping in front of fast cars. He said that the
UGM on Tuesday could be a possible target for a QT
Active Service Unit.
Data
Protection
Examination marks will
have to be disclosed to
students as a result of the
implementation of the data
protection Act in 1987.
The current practice is to
notify the result (ie pass or
fail) of an exam, sometimes
with a grade. Present
University of London
regulations prohibit the
disclosure of actual marks
to students. The new Act is
forcing a change in these
rules, although no change
will take place for exams
held in 1986.
The University's
Academic Council is
suggesting that all exam
marks should be notified to
individual students as a
matter of course. However,
the College's Board of
Studies, meeting on
Wednesday, refused to
support this view despite
pressure from student
representatives. The
College wants to meet the
minimum requirement of
the Act, and only disclose
exam marks to students
who specifically request
them. This view will be put
to the University, which will
finally decide the
procedure to be adopted.
If the College's view
prevails it has been pointed
out that if only a small
proportion of the 4800
students at IC write to the
Registry to find out their
marks this will create an
enormous administrative
work-load. Union President
Carl Burgess said he hopes
the Union will encourage
students to make such
enquiries with a view to
forcing the College to
reveal marks to everyone
automatically.
Colditz
Major Patrick Ried MBE
gave a Wellsoc lecture to a
nearly full physics lecture
theatre on Monday evening.
Major Ried was imprisoned
in Colditz castle for two
years and escaped in 1942.
He spent an hour retelling
stories of his days at the
German prisoner of war
camp for dedicated escape
artists. His anecdotes were
entertaining and frequently
stirred the audience to
laughter.
Major Ried's experiences,
and those of his fellow
prisoners, have been made
into a film and a television
series. He has also written
three books on the subject.
