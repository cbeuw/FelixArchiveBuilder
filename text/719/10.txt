I
One Nuclear Bomb Can
Ruin Your Whole Day'
Fire From The Ashes
Edited By Kenzaburo Oe
No slogans, no banners, no
CND Signs. Just ordinary
people telling us that 'a
nuclear bomb really can
ruin your whole day'. This
is the first ever collection in
English by Japanese
writers on one of todays
most urgent and universal
themes and its well timed
release marks forty years
since the bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasoki.
Many of the authors are
themselves surviviors of
these bombings and
although the book places
no blame, nor offers any
solution, it is nevertheless
vital reading for anyone
wishing to enter the
nuclear debate. After
reading this book my
overriding feeling is one of
shock, shocked by the
normality of the events
prior to the bombing,
contrasted with the
abstract,factual way in
which the scenes
afterwards are presented.
This is an important
collection of short stories,
well worth £3.50, and well
worth reading.

A ballad is traditionally a
poem narrating a popular
story, but I'm not sure that
The Ballad of Typhoid
Mary would be a popular
tale at all. It is about Mary
Mallon, a typhoid carrier
who was immune to the
disease but dealt death to
thousands of New Yorkers
for whom she cooked.
She embarked from an
emigrant ship on which 436
i
\\m'
out of 544 passengers,
including all of her family,
had died and fell straight in
to the clutches of a
paediophilic doctor.
Dorfheimer liked little girls,
but this one cooked him
scrambled eggs; he died.
After that came a
succession of posts where
Mary cooked fragrant,
ambrosial meals for her
employers—usually ending
up killing them within a
fortnight. Eventually a
particularly evil character,
having identified her as the
now legendary 'Typhoid
Mary', employed her to
look after a young Downs
Syndrome girl. Caroline
survived three happy years
with Mary which provoked
her guardians to take her
away and kill her
themselves.
Mary's twilight years
were spent as a virtual
prisoner in hospital
grounds, allowed out once
every three weeks to go
shoping. It is still a mystery
how much she knew about
the disease which she
carried, whether she
realised that she spread
death or merely thrust the
thought deep into her
subconscious. It is
interesting that long after
she turned to the church
for comfort she could never
pray for herself; someone
else peformed the office for
her.
For the amount of detail
in this story the book is too
long, more saga then
ballard both in its length
and in its macabre nature. I
would have welcomed more
information about the
central part of her life, and
feel that Federspeil has
spun out a long short story
into a short long story.
Published by King Penguin,
'The Ballard of Typhoid
Mary' costs £2.95.

Unfortunately for those
who have seen Mad Max 2,
Mad Max beyond
Thunderdome will probably
be a bit of a
disappointment. This is not
to say that George Miller
has lost any of his ability to
handle action, it's just that
there isn't enough for a
genre that is noted for it's
innovative and exciting
chases. I am not sure
whether this is the fault of
the story or having brought
in an extra director, George
Ogilvy.
If the nuclear apocalypse
wasn't bad enough, Max
starts off in the film by
having his transport stolen
by a one-parent family
team of pilots. This means
that on arrival in
Bartertown he has nothing
to trade except his skills,
which are of course,
sufficient to obtain him a
job as a mercenary. His
employer, competantly
played by Tina Turner, is
Aunty Entity who's control
over the town is threatened
by the head (and
shoulders) of the electricity
generating workers a
giant/dwarf team known as
Master Blaster Max's task
is to eliminate Blaster in a
gladiatorial combat in a
large birdcage called
Thunderdome. I don't wish
to spoil the plot, but I will
say that Max's subsequent
exile causes him to meet
the children of survivors of
an air cash who welcome
him as the messiah who
will lead them to the
promised land. This section
F I L M
of the film is rather slow,
but the contrast probably
enhances the fast and
Mad Max meets Flamingo Kid.
tunes are chopped and
badly abused.
This little moral tale is
about yet another American
kid growing up in yet
another American summer
holiday but the film is
redeemed by some
excellent acting. Richard
Crenna's smooth talking
salesman leads Jeffrey,
exciting shoot out at the
end.
The sets and costumes
are as imagninative as the
last film, but the nihilistic
desert is not exploited as
effectively as before. The
photography, however, is
largely excellent and the
use of close ups of some
exotic faces is wonderful,
an enjoyable film.
The producers of Mad
Max are obviously, aware of
the advertising mileage to
be had from music, as
shown by Tina Turner's
recent hit. Further evidence
of the symbiotic
relationship between film
and music is provided by
The Flamingo Kid. The film
is set in 1963 and hence
uses a lot of music from
that time, or there abouts.
This is very nearly a fault
as the makers of the film
apear to have attempted to
cram in as much nostalgic
music as possible, with the
result that a lot of classic
Matt Dillon, away from his
father's educational wishes
with seductive lines, such
"Who s.nd the
Hollywood hero
wnsdend?!"
as 'You don't see
philosophers making
$50,000 a year' and
'Socrates rode around on a
donkey'. All this leads to a
fairly engaging but
ephemeral comedy.
By contrast the early
sixties was also the time
that Jean Luc Godard was
begining to shock
audiences with his
subversion of cinematic
conventions and his recent
film contains many of his
trademarks. The
photography, for example,
contrasts modern dull
Europe in the form of cars,
bland rooms, gas stations
with references to land
points, (from the postures
of Mary) nature's beauty,
green fields, red poppies
and storm tossed lakes.
The soundtrack again uses
music, Bach, Dvorak, to
useful effect, but being
Godard it is often in abrupt
snatches between sacred
silences and street noises.
The plot is straight
forward enough. It is a
remaking of the Virgin Birth
set in modern Switzerland.
Mary, a keen basketball
player, lives in a petrol
station and Joseph is a taxi
driver. This being modern
times Joseph finds Mary's
pregnacy somewhat hard to
cope with, as he has not
been anywhere near her,
and he suspects someone
else until he is 'put right' by
an unshaven and somewhat
heavy handed Angel
Gabriel. The family soon
settles down and before
long Jesus, surely still too
young, set off 'to do his
father's work'.
Godard constantly
reminds us of Mary's
spiritual nature by using
shots of the moon. Always
a chaste and virginal
goddess, and even a
nativity scene with all the
appropriate animals.
Finally, the film requires a
fair degree of effort from
the audience but it's
worthwhile to see some
innovative cinema work.
