A Confession?
Dear Hugh,
I am forced to agree with
Mr Jones, and admit I am a
hypocrite. Not because of
my sometimes terrible
sexist attitudes—attitudes
that I have grown up with
but would never defend,
justify or exhort; attitudes
that I strive to change
My hypocrisy lies in the
fact that I, along with Mr
Jones, am a member of a
Union that condemns
pornography and RSMU,
yet does not act; a Union
that at fine occasions such
as Commemoration Day
dons an air of
respectability, a false
polished sheen hiding an
infantile, violently
prejudiced and sexist
organisation.
That these 'fine' RSMU
graduates, resplendant in
their gowns, should honour
such great men as T H
Huxley, and uphold 'the
study of science for
science's sake', is, in my
opinion, true, sickening
hypocrisy. Students like the
Hon Pornographer, and
other supporters of archaic
sexist traditions, each year
insult my College.
I am proud to be a
student at IC, but I am not
proud to being a party to
the hypocrisy of its
students and Union. We are
all guility of hypocrisy.
Joint responsibilty means
that we, members of ICU,
must be accountable for
this hypocrisy, even though
it stems from a minority.
I hope Mr Jones, and all
of you, will join me and
many others in criticising
ourselves and doing
something about it.
Yours sincerely
Michael P Newman
Editors Note: I'm quite keen
to keep discussion going
on any subject. FELIX
should be open to anyone
who has an opinion to
express. I feel, though, that
the correspondence on
Michael Newman, Mike
Jones etc has gone on long
enough. No more
correspondence will be
printed on this subject
unless it is excessively
witty or interesting
Good Bye
Sir,
Having lived in the
Fremantle Hotel between
Sept 84 and July 85 I feel
your article last week under
the headline 'Good
Riddance' was a gross
misrepresentation of the
facts, and did not do justice
to the community spirit
which developed amongst
the residents there.
Whilst it is true that
structurely the building was
in a poor state of repair,
this was entirely due to a
recalcitrant owner against
whose lack of concern, the
residents, warden and
College had continually to
struggle in order to get
even the most urgent
repairs done.
Nevertheless, due entirely
to the good sense,
determination and good
humour of the residents
(particularly the first years
and re-apps) the Fremantle
enjoyed one of the most
active social lives of any of
the Imperial College
residences, and certainly
provided myself and many
others with their most
pleasant memories of life at
Imperial College.
Therefore, it must be said
that many of the people
who actually lived in the
Hotel will greet the news of
it burning down with very
mixed feelings, and it is
also true that in terms of an
enjoyable social
atmosphere, in my five
years at IC I have never
been in a residence to
compare with it.
Yours sincerely

White Noise
Dear Mr Southey,
My first impression of IC
Radio was that it provided
a useful and informative
service to the students of
the college, playing a wide
variety of popular music.
However, this cannot be
said of the programme I
heard on Wednesday night.
On returning from the
Southside Bar, I tuned to
IC Radio, as many students
do at that time of night and
was subjected to idiotic
banter, stupid jokes
(including something about
a competition where the
prize was 'a night of
passion with Madonna')
and too much so-called
'alternative' music. The
presenters obviously did
not approach the job with
the same sense of
responsibility as do other
IC Radio presenters.
So this Wednesday night,
if the 'William and Paul'
show (original name isn't
lit?) occupies the late slot
then I for one will be
having an early night.
Yours sincerely
S P White.
Phantom Fight
Dear Hugh,
I was fascinated to hear of
the antics of the 'Phantom
Soaker' (FELIX, 25th
October 1985), but was
disturbed by Mr Reeves'
concern about the
Phantom's health.
I feel sure that despite a
non-conformist attitude of
the rewards due to so-
called 'snobby nosed
swots', this anonymous
aquaphile is quite sane.
After three weeks, totting
up in excess of a
phenomenal 30 soakings,
the Phantom's true identity
is still unknown. This fact
proves that he has an
unnatural skill in the art of
camouflage. His attacks on
noted academics and
respected staff show that
he has nerves of steel and
a constitution comparable
to that of renowned
deviants.
If my deductions of the
Phantom's character are
accurate,! believe that
he/she will accept this
challenge;
I, Andrew Vickers,
challenge the 'Phantom
Soaker' to a water-fight in
the Round Pond (Hyde
Park), at a time of his/her
choice. Weapons are water
pistols, buckets or plastic
carrier bags.
I look forward to hearing
from Imperial College's
own notorious fiend
through your newspaper.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew Vickers
Yes To Indsoc
Sir,
Designed to cause
controversy or designed to
fill space? Surely you could
have spared us the drivel
contained in Steve
Marshall's article last week.
To say that it was short on
rational argument would be
charitable (though I admit
that it made up for this in
pure abuse!). I joined the
Industrial Society a couple
of weeks ago and I'm still
trying to find something
sinister about it. I for one
find the real problems that
industry faces a lot more
interesting than those
contrived for us in College.
To suggest that it is
wrong to want to know
more about the
opportunities available after
college is obviously
ridiculous—surely most
people want to look at a
number of other
universities before picking
Imperial College—was that
wrong?
The continuing health of
,a company is, in part, due
to attracting appropriate
inew employees—does Mr
iMarshall really deprecate
the small cost that may be
incurred in entertaining to
achieve this? The
;continuing health of
JBritain's industry is
important, if only so that
the wealth of taxes
generated are sufficient to
support those who 'choose
other more aesthetic things
in life'. Perhaps Mr Marshall
is biting the hand that
feeds..?
IC students have a right
to know what goes on in
the outside world. They
have the intelligence to
make up their minds for
themselves. Any attempt to
repress this right by the
Union, due to the prejudice
of a small number of hacks
who happen to have
influence in the hierarchy
would be an act unworthy
of a free, democratic
organisation.
Yours,
Trevor Power
