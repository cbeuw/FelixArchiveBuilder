Amnesty International was
launched in 1961 following
a newspaper article by a
British lawyer, Peter
Benenson, which called on
people to work impartially
and peacefully for the
release of the thousands of
men and women
imprisoned throughout the
world for their political and
religious beliefs. The
response was immediate
and Amnesty has kept
growing ever since. In 1985
it is the world's largest
voluntary organisation with
more than 250,000
members in 134 countries
who have intervened on
behalf of more than 20,000
prisoners of conscience.
Amongst the many
recognitions of
achievement received by
the organisation are the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1977
and the United Nations
Human Rights prize.
AI is a worldwide
movement which is totally
independant of any
government, political
faction, ideology or
religious creed. It seeks the
release of prisoners of
conscience. These are
people detained anywhere
for their beliefs, colour,
language or religion who
have neither used nor
advocated violence.
Amnesty is also
Amnesty International
Amnesty International is a College Rag Charity. There
is also a small but active group within the College.
What does Amnesty actually do? Mike Robinson
attempts to describe the charity's activities.
compaigning vigorously for
the abolition of torture and
the death penalty. In order
to maintain its
independence, all finance is
obtained through carefully
vetted donations and
subscriptions.
The main work of
individual members is to
get in contact with, and try
to put pressure on,
governments guility of
human rights abuse.The
usual way is by appealing
on behalf of specific people
about whom information
has been obtained through
Amnesty's research
departments. Work also
includes trying to contact
prisoners to reassure them
that someone is worried
about them and is trying to
improve their situation.
Fund-raising is also very
important as the money
rait.ed enables Amnesty to
carry out the necessary
research and
administration.
The group within college
has its own adopted
prisoner for whose release
we are campaigning. He
has been imprisoned in
Russia as a result of his
religious beliefs. There is
also an investigation case,
a South African, who we
are trying to gain more
information about. We are
also members of the Urgent
Action Scheme and take
part in the Campaign for
the Aboliton of Torture. In
the Urgent Action Scheme
letters or telexes are sent to
the respective heads of
governments about specific
cases within their country
which require some form of
immediate action. Finally,
the group has to raise
money for Amnesty to
carry out investigation
work.
Anybody who is
interested in knowing more
about AI is invited to come
to the College group's
meetings which are held
every Tuesday at 5.30pm in
the Brown Committee
Room on the top floor of
the Union Building. If you
can't spare the time how
about ordering Xmas cards
or supporting our other
fund-raising activities?
