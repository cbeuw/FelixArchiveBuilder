IC continued their
| impressive start to the
season with a convincing 4-
1 victory against Sussex in
the national UAU
competition.
The game was all but
over after 15 minutes with
IC storming into a 3-0 lead.
The first, after 5 minutes,
came from a defence-
splitting through ball by
Alex Lunghi allowing Tom
Dutton to beat the
advancing keeper. Two
minutes later, a one-two on
the edge of the box left
Paul Bravery clear with just
the keeper to beat, which
he duly did with a shot, low
to the keeper's left. IC's
third came when a Tom
Dutton cross caused the
Sussex defence to panic
and a collision between the
Sussex keeper and central
defender left Paul Bravery
with the simplest of tap-ins.
IC continued to dominate
the rest of the first half but
allowed Sussex back into
the game in the second.
Midway through the second
half Sussex pulled one
back when Bryce
Goldsbrough superbly
volleyed the ball past his
own keeper; the best goal
of the game. Sussex
continued to press forward
but IC made the game safe
when another goal-mouth
scramble enabled Dave
Lynne to fire home from
close range.

Most definately the teams'
best performance so far
this season, with a
wholesome variety of team
work and individual skills
which paid dividends to
produce a deserved 3-0
victory.
A secure defence led by
the captain, Paul Smith,
gave confidence to the
half-backs to venture into
attack creating openings
for the forwards, and with
some good runs from
wingers Jez and Paul,
produced a handful of goal
scoring opportunities.
Unfortunately, a Kttle over
zealous, our centre
forward, trying to take
advantage of such an
opportunity, hit an already
fallen Paul Dubenski
square on the jaw, he later
having to leave the pitch
for a subsequent hospital
patch up. Suffering from
the loss, but more
determined, IC continued
to control the game. Ian
Parker finally converted a
short corner leaving us 1-0
up at half-time.
Back up to 11 men after
borrowing RCS's right
wing, skills emerged which
nobody thought existed
and Ian Parker put another
goal home from a penalty
flick after a scuffle around
the goal.
Support from the IC
ladies hockey team spurred
the team on, especially
John Stonham who was
seen in Sussex's D and
managed a shot,
subsequently saved and
nudged home by Justin.
All I keep hearing is 'four
win's in a row â€” you're
kidding'.
Sunbury 1 IC 2nd XI 1
IC second XI recorded their
first point of the season in
a closely contested 1-1
draw. The 'Twos' made it to
Sunbury despite the efforts
of Chris 'what orange car?'
Harrison to write off the
Union's brand new minibus.
A fairly shoddy
performance ensued with
Sunbury soon capitalising
on some sleepy defensive
work, building an attack
down the left and slotting
the ball home to go one up.
A combination of poor
finishing on the oppositions
part and sterling work in
defence from Chris
Harrison prevented any
worsening of the scoreline
by half-time.
The introduction of
former captain, Duncan
Wigney in the second half
promoted a fresh impetus
in the side but coincided
with increased effort from
Sunbury. IC spent some
considerable time
entrenched in the wrong
half with the opposition
forcing a series of short
corners from which they
were unlucky not to score.
In the face of some
adversity the seconds
forced their way out of
their half to create an
enterprising attack
culminating in some
clinical finishing from Nick
Hope to gain the equaliser.
On the whole a mediocre
' performance but not
without some encouraging
signs for the rest of the
season.
