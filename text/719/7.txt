Floods, and the destruction
they can cause, pose a
major threat to built-up
areas in the vicinity of
rivers and estuaries. In
these areas flood-gates are
sometimes used as part of
flood protection schemes
to control storm and tidal
surges, and so reduce
potential risk to life and
property. Dr D Hardwick,
from the Civil Engineering
Department, has been
involved with the testing of
possible flood-gate designs
for a number of major
protection schemes,
including the Thames
Barrier Project.

tailored to meet the needs
of each individual area.
Because of this predicton
of how they will perform is
often difficult, especially if
they have unusual duties,
or complex structural
features. A major problem
is that turbulence in the
surrounding water flow can
initiate vibrations in the
structure that ultimately
lead to structural fatigue or
even spectacular
resonance. By building
realistic small scale models
it is possible to investigate
the suitability of floodgates
of novel design under
future operating conditons
and ensure that they won't
suffer vibration induced
damage. Dr Hardwick's
group test designs by
constructing small scale
models that are inexpensive
yet yield a great deal of
valuable information.
The Thames Barrier
Project is probably the
most well known flood
protection scheme that the
group have worked on.
They were involved at an
early stage, working with
the consultants Rendel,
Palmer and Tritton, looking
into the basic design and
ways to improve it. Later on
they worked with the
contractors studying the
feasibility of getting the
gates into position by
floating them in on a falling
tide. The barrier has a
design life of eighty years,
but it will be effective for
far longer. During this time
it will be used initially only
once or twice a year, with a
really disastrous flood
likely to occur once every
twenty years. Without such
a barrier the threat to
London would be
intolerable.
On the strength of their
experience with the
Thames Barrier, Dr
Hardwick's group were
asked to test a possible
design for the proposed
Scheldt barrier at Antwerp.
The city of Antwerp, on the
River Scheldt, is
increasingly threatened
with flooding, as a result of
storm surges from the
North Sea. In 1980 it was
proposed that a flood
barrier, similar in function
to the Thames barrier,
should be built just down
river from the city. The
group were asked to carry
out vibration studies on a
possible configuration put
forward by the designers
Joint Venture SVKS of
Brussells. The design
consisted of 3 80 metre
span drop gates spannng
the busy navigation
channel, but stored high
up, allowing traffic to pass
beneath; in the event of a
flood warning these gates
would drop down blocking
off the channel. These were
flanked on either side by 50
metre span radial gates
reaching to the margins of
the esturary. Physical
models , such as the one of
the radial gate shown in fig
1 were constructed, which
reproduced to scale the
main geometric and
dynamic features of the
proposed gates. Studies
using the models showed
that the radial gates had
excellent stability, but that
the drop gates should be
closed and locked well in
advance of the approaching
surge if serious vibrational
problems were to be
Fig. 3
avoided. The design study
has been completed but
severe financial constraints
have delayed
implementation.
On a more modest scale,
the North West Water
Authority are at present
constructing a scheme
which will reduce the risk
of flooding on the River
Wye at Garstang, between
Lancaster and Preston.
This scheme is shown in
Fig 2; at the approach of a
storm surge the pair of
gates, which normally rest
on the river bed, are
automatically raised
causing water to be
temporarily stored on the
flood plain upsteam of the
gates. This water would
otherwise flood the built-up
area which is downsteam.
The group were asked, by
the designers Messrs Rofe,
Kennard and Lapworth, to
provide information on the
water levels once the new
system was installed, and
the effect it would have on i
an exisiting pump intake
just downstream. The
model that they
constructed, shown in Fig
3, was inexpensive to build j
and gave speedy and
satisfactory results.
The use of small scale
models can be very
effective, as it allows
researchers to gain
valuable information about
how new flood-gate
designs will perform, and
how to modify proposed
designs. In the case of
totally new designs models j
may be the only source of
information. Without well
designed flood protection
schemes there is an
unacceptably large risk to
life and property in many
areas.
