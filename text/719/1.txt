Another Barman
Bites The Dust
Union barman Tony McVey was
sacked by refectory manager
Rob Northey on Monday, after
the bar failed to open on
Saturday night. Mr McVey's
dismissal comes only four
weeks after the controversial
resignations of former bar
manager Doug Armstrong and
barman Brian Ellison.
Mr McVey did not arrive to
open the Union bar on Saturday
evening, and the casual staff
were unable to contact either
Mr Northey, who was away for
the weekend, or barman Dave
Brennan, each of whom has a
set of keys. The bar remained
closed all evening and both the
staff and the weekend
customers went over to
Southside bar. The bar was
open as usual on Sunday.
Mr McVey had been working
at IC for only five weeks when
he was transfered to the Union
bar from a job in the refectories.
When he made the
appointment, Mr Northey was
confident that Mr McVey had
the necessary experience to run
a bar. He told FELIX on
Tuesday that he would not be
appointing a replacment bar
manager, since the future of the
bar was still uncertain owing to
the plans for a Union takeover.
He felt that it would be unfair to
make a new apppointment when
control of the bar might very
shortly be changing hands, and
added that for the moment the
bar would be run on a day to
day basis.
Mr McVey is now working in a
pub in Woolwich, where he was
contacted by FELIX on
Wednesday evening. He said
that he was unable to open the
Union bar on Saturday night as
he was ill with a form of food
poisoning. He had asked a
friend to try and contact Mr
Northey or assistant refectory
manager Martin Parsons on his
behalf but he had been unable
to do so. Mr McVey denied the
suggestion that he had been
offered his present job last
week. He said that he had rung
the pub on Monday, following
his dismissal, and had been
offered the job from that
evening. He declined to make
any comment on Mr Northey's
running of the bars.
Mr Northey said on Thursday
that he had taken 'everything
into consideration' when
making the decision to dismiss
Mr Mc'v'ey, but feit that more
effort could have been made to
get the keys to the bar.
Mr Northey stood by his
original decision to appoint a
barman from the refectory staff,
rather than to advertise the
vacancy. He said that it was far
better to give the job to
someone he knew, particularly
in view of the short term nature
of the appointment. He admitted
that he had been more aware of
the possibility of a Union
takeover of the Bar than he had
been prepared to admit at the
time.
Going
Underground
City and Guilds Union held a
UGM with a difference on
Monday afternoon. Due to an
error over room bookings Mech
Eng 220 was not available, so
the meeting was held on the
London Underground. Guilds
President Roger Preece opened
the meeting on the westbound
platform of South Kensington
Station with his own report.
After the first adjournment, the
remaining reports were read,
but not necessarily heard, on
the second carriage of a circle
line tube. Elections for various
posts were then held before the
second adjournment at Baker
Street. Despite frequent appeals
over the station tannoy sytem,
the meeting continued on the
platform with the remaining
elections, and closed with a
resounding 'Boomalaka'.
A Walk In The Park
Sixty IC students took part in
the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament demonstration last
Saturday. The 'Rally for the
Human Race', attended by
around 100,000 people, was the
largest CND demonstration in
London for two years. ICCND
took the chance to publicise the
arrival of SDI 'Star Wars'
research at Imperial College. IC
Socialist Society and members
of Imperial's trade union
branches were also on the
march.
The demonstration began
with a circular march from Hyde
Park, taking in both the US and
Soviet embassies. The marchers
took part in a four minute 'die-
in' and a four minute sit-down
protest along the way. On
completing the route, protesters
formed a giant CND symbol in
the park.
The success of the
demonstration will be seen as a
boost to CND, both nationally
and at college level. After a year
in the shadow of other popular
movements such as Live Aid,
the debate on SDI is bringing
the nuclear issue back into the
public eye.
