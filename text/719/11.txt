Code Of The Lifemaker
James P. Hogan. (Penguin)
The S.F. cliche, lesson
32: 'Once, long ago, a robot
factory-ship flew too near a
star unexpectedly going
nova. After suffering
extensive damage it
continued blindly for
millenia. The years passed.
Then in the twenty-first
century, a colony ship
destined for Mars was
surreptitiously rerouted to
Titan and only the leaders
of the Military Industrial
Complex knew why...'. But
so do you pretty soon as
every single element of
potential suspense in this
book is given away.
Meanwhile by page 13, the
robots on Titan have
evolved by the most
preposterous chain of
events into life forms
capable of inventing sex. If
Harry Edison had picked
up the theme at this point it
would have been an
amusing book. If Isaac
Asimov had, it might have
been thought provoking. As
I walked into the trendy
community centre in
Chelsea, sat down and
watched an Opera so bad
that it made me want to
scream and bang my head
against the wall. I was sure
I had come to the right
place.
Egad! Gadsookers! This
was a burlesque on
Restoration Opera
(1700ish—1770ish)
performed, shall we say in
the style, spirit and to the
standard of 18th century
Opera.
I sat through two operas,
The Chaplet, about the
eternal triangle of love, and
Pyramus and Thisbe about
two star-crossed or at least
well-separated lovers. It
was difficult to tell whether
the two works were
originally so droll and
unbelievably slapstick, or if
they had been suitably
altered by the company.
it is, it's rather long. There
are lots of quite clever
ideas and the near-future
world Hogan describes is
as believable as any of
Arthur C. Clarke's novels
but the whole lot is blotted
out by clumsy writing. The
concept of a robot
civilisation where the roles
of organic and synthesized
materials are reversed
seems inventive: but by
using it as a direct analogy
of the entire history of the
human race, and littering it
with names reeking of post-
Tolkien drivel, most of the
possibilities are wasted.
And as for a latter-day
NASA hiring psychics, God
(and there is religious
philosophy a-plenty) only
knows why this
complication was
necessary. This book
shows that it is difficult to
combine the stories of
Galileo, I, Robot and the
complete works of Arthur
C. Clarke into one volume.
40p pages of stumbling,
near-future philosophising
for £2.95. Methinks
someone was trying to
write 2001 and got 1002.
The singing was fair, just
the odd rushed beat that
had the orchestra wince
and pause, and very well
they played too, all eleven
of them.
The two highpoints of the
evening were, for me, the
wall in Pyramus and
Thisby, and the finale. The
wall seemed to imagine
that it was a person
covered in carpet tiles, and
hence kept on turning
round and knocking
unconscious members of
the cast. At the finale came
a highly contrived audience
riot, where upon a signal
we all shouted and pelted
the cast with Brussel
sprouts and plastic fruit.
Imperial Opera, the
august dodos that provided
us with this entertainment,
was founded in 1979 by a
bunch of Ex-IC students
and their associates. Since
then they have performed
many operas, by
composers as diverse as
Purcell, Hoist, Offenbach
and Dvorak. They hope to
perform Salad Days in
Guernsey, sorry folks, and
Ruddigore by Gilbert and
Sullivan at the Secombe
Centre (wherever that is) in
October. Anyone interested
in performing, tickets,
playing with instruments,
throwing fruit etc can
contact Mr Johnson, 44,
Farnley Rd SE 25 or tel 653

Hamsoc
Invisible
IC's amateur Radio Society,
or Hamsoc, as it is more
generally known, is
perhaps one of College's
less visible societies,
despite various pieces of
metalwork on the Union
Building roof.
We are now trying to
become far more active
after several in the This
renewed vigour will be
directed towards erecting
our new antenna system for
VHF/UHF which will be
located atop the Electrical
engineering building, 50
metres above ground. You
may be thinking that
amateur radio is all about
picking up a microphone
(or a morse key) and
rabbiting on to other
amateurs across the globe.
You can do that of course,
but this years activity
includes everything from
painting our antenna mast
with the paint to which
mussels can't stick, to
setting up and installing
our pulse coded control
system. This device will be
used to control the rotator
direction and switch
equipment on and off by
sending digital information
up half a kilometre of
coaxial cable, sharing it
with the radio frequency
signals that we are
transmitting. There is also
feedback sent back down
the cable to indicate where
the antennae are pointing.
Once this is all working it
will need to be carried up
to the Electrical
Engineering roof and set
up.
Although putting up
pieces of metal may be
great for those of us who
hold an amateur licence,
it's a bit self-defeating for
those who don't. To sort
out this problem,we can
instruct those of you who
want to take the City and
Guilds Instititue exam and
also help with the morse if
you want to go for the full
license. (This isn't
necessary unless you want
to use short-wave, ie long
distance, frequencies). It
doesn't take much work to
gain an amateur license,
and once you've got it, it's
yours for ever, opening up
a lot of possibilities in
communication and self-
training in all aspects of
electronics (and life!)
It you're interested in the
ticket to a great hobby,
come and see us in the
shack on the third floor,
Union Building, or see (or
write to) me, Brian
Morrison. (Elec Eng 4).
Dramsoc
Lighting
Dramsoc isn't just acting
and general pratting
around on stage. Lighting
and sound are just as
important ie pratting
around above and behind
the stage. We don't just
light plays; most of the
Ents Gigs are lit by us as
well, and we supply lighting
for many other parties
around College. It's not
difficult, which is why we
are running a workshop for
lighting on Wednesday 6th
November. If your
knowledge of lighting is
limited to replacing a 60w
bulb in your anglepoise
then you are especially
welcome. Come along and
find out about the wild and
wacky world of Gobos and
Fresnels. We're on Level
two and a half Union
Building East Staircase.
We will also be running a
sound and stage workshop
on Wednesday 20
November while the
succesful acting workshops
will continue on 13 and 27
November.
STOIC
New Era
Stoic is entering a new,
exciting era. As you may
know, each Thursday we
broadcast 'Newsbreak' in
the halls and J C R at
1.00pm and 6.00pm (halls
only). This is a special
programme for the students
by the students. We are
introducing a new item in
these newsbreaks called
'Videobox'. This gives you a
chance to say anything you
like for a minute or so. All
you have to do is sit in
front of the camera and
speak. Embarrass your
friends, put forward your
views (political or
otherwise), tell jokes..
There is a special treat in
store for everyone before
Christmas—an all-night
programme including at
least two feature films,
cartoons and hopefully
several episodes from 'The
Young Ones'.
Darts
Challenge
The newly formed Chem
Eng Darts team throw
down the gauntlet to any
other department that
thinks they can outdrink or
play them. Teams must be
mixed. If interested contact
Dave Tyler Chem Eng letter

enough to accept this
