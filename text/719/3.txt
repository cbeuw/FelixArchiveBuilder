Dear Hugh,
Over the past two weeks I
have read, with no great
surprise, your stories about
the troubles Selkirk and
Tizard are suffering as a
result of modification to
Southside. I was a resident
in Tizard Hall for two years,
one as a re-app, and served
on the Hall Committe for
most of that time. It was
therefore with some
surprise that I learnt of the
forthcoming work over the
summer. No mention of this
had been made in hall
committee meetings. There
was no consultation on the
subject, no chance to air
the views of the people
who actually live there, not
even formal notification
before the end of term. The
first any Tizard Hail official
knew (warden included, i
believe) was when the
assistant subwarden got
back from holiday and was
told by the housekeeper
that 'work starts in two
weeks'!
Being somewhat
concerned about this rather
unsatisfactory state of
affairs, I went and sooke to
Dave Kingston and Carl
Burgess during the
holidays to find out if the
rumours I had heard were
true. Unfortunately they
were. The plans seemed t)
have been slipped througi,
in the interregnum period
as last year's exec moved
out and this year's moved
in. The current exec was
apparently told what was
happening, saw no reason
to complain or even to tell
the Southside people what
was going on, and
continued merrily on their
way. They didn't even seem
to accept that a different
plan was possible, though
now Carl seems to accept
not only the possiblity but
the need for 'different
plans'.
They even had the gall to
suggest that the ICU exec
knew more about what
living in Southside is about
than the hall committees.
Come on, you people
were elected by us to
represent us not to help the
Managing Surveyor
(Residences) in trying to
push through plans that
will wreck hall social life
(which might have been the
idea in the first place). The
hall committee wouldn't
have had to produce a
petition if you'd done your
job properly.
Yours annoyedly

Dear Editor,
Whilst I appreciate your
inclusion of arts reviews in
FELIX, can I draw your
attention to the lack of vital
information in the 'Bloody
Funny' review. There was
no mention of where the
show was piaying, not even
the title of Ms Ingleton's
comedy. Wishing to share
the joke I managed to
discover that it was at the
ICA until Saturday 19
October and it was entitled
'Strip Jack Naked'.
Let's hope this attempt to
promote culture in IC
continues, but that reviews
are more helpful in future.
Yours disappointedly

Editors Note: I must
apologise. I attempt to
ensure that all reviews have
all the relevant information.
Unfortunately I'm not
perfect. If anyone wants to
help with proof reading
they will be more than
welcome in the FELIX

Politics
Dear Sir,
I should like to reply to S
Dunlop's letter of last week
concerning Southern
Africa,
The African National
Congress (ANC) is a
communist front
organisation in South
Africa aided by military
links with the PLO and
SWAPO, with the aim of
overthrowing, by violent
and bloody means, the
government of S Africa.
Gromyko, in his recent
publications on S Africa
nas frequently
congratulated the 'fine
work' done by the A N C and
clearly sets out how to use
'military force' so that when
in power they can demand
a 'monopoly of power' ie
dictatorship. Recent
evidence has shown the
ANC seek power not peace,
domination not freedom.
We must work toward
change in the present
system not by violent
struggle but through
democratic processes. That
is what I believe State
President Botha is trying to
achieve and why I support
his measures of reform.

Dear Hugh,
At the risk of becoming
known as 'notorious
college bore' Mike Jones
here's another letter for
V C J — m a y b e if you think it
merits a full page article
please go ahead and
publish! What follows is the
entire text of a letter written
to me personally from
notorious college bore
Mike Newman plus my
comments and replies. As
you will see I have
ODviously stirred up a bit of
a hornet's nest inside Mr
iMewman's mind.
Dear Mike Jones,
Having read your letter I
was very confused. Firstly
your original letter was an
attack on me not my
arguments. I felt the tone of
this first letter and
presumably the reasons for
writing it, were not those of
someone condemning
RSMU and its support of
events showing hard-core
pornography. I have no
idea what your views are
on nuclear warfare, human
rights, sexism and porn, all
' know is your letter
attempted to question my
sincerity over all these
issues. If as you say in your
second letter you hold
similar ideals to me it
appears you are not willing
to act on them, and indeed
would rather attack people
'ho are doing something.
As I say in my second
'stter it is the way that
-hose people are going
about doing something that
quite frankly gets on my
tits rather than the ideals
concerned—more about my
method at a future
date—groans of boredom
from the silent majority at
IC. Back to M Newman's
letter.
Your whole ignorance on
the matter of the issue you
write about is unbelievable.
An 'anti-porn' motion was
put to an IC UGM in 1983-
34, RSMU cleverly
prevented it being debated
at the first UGM (does
anyone else remember the
amendment trump card!)
At the next one it was
debated for the first time,
and was passed despite tne
futile efforts of Chris
Crownshaw exhibiting his
usual respect for
democracy cy walking out
trying to create inquoracy.
Indeed it was quite a sight
these chickens running!
Presumably you would
have enjoyed it as much as
me as we hold similar
ideals, (cont on page 94)
