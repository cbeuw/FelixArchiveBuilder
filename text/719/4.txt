they will do so. The U G C is I
trying to ensure that
catering and bars don't
receive a subsidy. The
Union is not charged for
heating, rates, cleaning and
various other overheads.
It's possible that College
believe these overheads are
going to be charged to the
Bar in future and want to
get rid of the Bar before
this happens so that it isn't
their problem. The Union
Planning Group will have
discussed the Bar by the
time you read this. I hope
that they have discussed all
the problems.
Sex
FELIX will be running a
Sex Special' in a few
weeks time. It will have a
series of articles on various
subjects connected with
sex. If you haven't filled in
a survey, could you help by
doing it today. Secondly, if
you're gay, could you write
us an article on being gay
at Imperial and send it to
me in the FELIX office
anonymously. I think it
would be of interest to
people to read about the
problems of being gay.
Photocopies
FELIX now has a
photocopier for the use of
clubs, societies, CCUs etc.
It can produce A4 and A3
copies. It does
enlargements, reductions
etc. The charge is 3p a
copy plus paper cost. The
charges for paper are 1p
for a sheet of white A3 and
2p for a sheet of coloured
A3. The photocopier also
handles dayglo and card.
You will be invoiced for the
work after you have done it
(ie you don't have to pay in
cash for the service). There
is a minimum charge of 50p
for use of the service.
Contraceptive Dispenser
Pete Wilson, the Welfare
Officer is looking into
installing a contraceptive
dispenser in the toilets of
one of the bars. Please
contact him if you have
ideas on this subject.
Rag Week
Jon Ingham asked me to
remind you that Rag Week
is only a few days away. So
start saving your pennies
so that you can go to all
the wonderful Rag events.

Education Cuts
Sir Keith Joseph, the
Education Minister, will be
visiting the College next
Thursday to speak to
Consoc. Sir Keith has
administered severe cuts in
the government's funding
of universities. These cuts
have affected the quality of
the education you are
receiving. They have meant
that you have had to run up
an overdraft so that you
can complete your studies.
Britain needs high quality
graduates. The electronics
industry, for example, can
not get enough graduates.
The government has
decided to spend money on
defence rather than
education. This decision
seems set to do
incalculable damage to
Britain's industry. It is vital
that we make our views
known when Sir Keith visits
College. Join the Socsoc
picket of the Great Hall.
Please make the picket
peaceful, though. It
seriously damages
students' interests if they
are seen on TV throwing
eggs at government
ministers. It reinforces the
public's belief that students
are just radical louts.
Freebies
Those of you who sit on
Council will have been
invited to the Sherry Party
on Monday. This is an
annual event paid for by
the Union. It is aimed at
getting College officials
and the Union together in a
relaxed environment so that
the Union can make
College aware of the
problems students face.
Unfortunately many Union
officers use it to get pissed
for free. If you get invited
to this event you will see
the majority of hacks
gathered together in a
corner while a few entertain
the College notables. If you
are a Union officer who is
going to the event, may I
suggest you make a
donation to cover the cost
of the food and drink you
consume, this way you can
influence College and ,iave
a good time without
costing the Union anything.
The Union is short of
money. College would be
impressed with how short
of money the Union is if
the hacks voluntarily

Bars
In the last two weeks John
Smith, College Secretary,
has drawn up a discussion
document suggesting that
the Union should take
control of the bar and Tony
McVey has lost his job as
bar manager. It is difficult
to know what to think. Mr
Smith and Mr Northey
seem to be desperate to get
rid of the bar. The
appointment of Mr McVey
as a Bar Manager can only
have been a short term
move by College. Mr
McVey was unhelpful and
inexperienced.
Until recently it seemed
likely that we would have to
trade part of the Union
Building for the Bar. The
latest document seems to
suggest that we should be
given the Bar for free. The
Union must ask why
College plans to give away
a bar that apparently makes
lots of money.
College claim that they
are transferring control to
improve efficiency. If this is
the case, the Union must
do its best to get a good
deal from College. The
negotiations about the Bar
could be used to the
Union's benefit. The
discussion document
suggests that the Union
should be given a separate
legal identity (at present
the Union cannot be
prosecuted, it is regarded
as part of College). If the
Union does become a
seperate legal body, it
should consider asking for
ownership of the north side
of Beit. This would mean
that Life Sci could not
attempt to take over the
Union Building. I realise
that given the current
financial climate this
unlikely. It does no harm to
ask, though.
Nobody, though, seems
to have considered the
possibility that the College
want to get rid of the Bar
for a specific reason. FELIX
editors are meant to be
paranoid about College
officials hatching up
schemes to destroy the
Union. In general, I think
the College are fair when
dealing with the Union.
College administrators,
though, have a job to do
and if they can make it
easier by giving the Union
a bar that is set to cause
problems in the near future
