IC 1st XV 21 Sussex 1sts 4
This was the first game for
the UAU competition, and
was the most important
game of the season to date.
Phil Clarke obviously had
this in mind when he
washed' the kit, as it
ended up in the middle of
the changing room, daring
us to put it on.
Ian 'Hutch' Hutchinson
opened the scoring with a
try about half way through
the first half, which was
converted by Neil Folland,
who also added a penalty
before half-time, putting
the score at 9-0. After half-
time Sussex made a come-
back, scoring a try to bring
the score back to 9-4, and
this woke us up a bit. Phil
Clarke scored after a rather
eccentric penalty move,
which came about after one
of the Sussex players came
offside in a rolling maul,
Neil Folland converted this
and added another two
penalties making the final
score 21-4 to IC.
Ski
On Saturday 19 October,
for the first time in its
history, the IC Ski Club
participated in a
competition event, and won
its first cup.
The result was very
pleasing, the team coming
fourth in a field of twelve
teams from various London
Colleges. The competition
took the form of several
rounds of parallel slalom
relays, in which two teams
race down parallel slalom
courses on a relay basis,
the winner being the team
to get its last man through
the finishing gate first.
The team entered was
scratched together at the
very last moment, and
included only one of the
many international stars we
hope to have in the next
race on 23 November.
Team: Kate Finch, Matthew
Norris, Pablo Graves, Mike
Barran, Bruce Fleming and
Peter Drummond-Smith.
Boat
The Boat Club entered its
first four's event of the year
on Sunday with notable
success. The upper
Thames Small Boats Head
is raced over two and
three-quarter miles

upstream at Henley. The
event was run in two
divisions and gave crews
the chance to enter two
events.
In the first division IC
had two senior A coxless
fours and one senior A
coxed four. The coxed four
went well, gaining on
coxed crews who started
ahead of them. The coxless
fours started second and
third in this division behind
the elite, National
Lightweight four from last
summer. The A Crew
rowed well over the first
half of the course and lost
about ten seconds to the
squad four over the second
half. The B Crew lost some
ground to the A Crew
through some wide steering
that took them further into
the stream; apart from this

the crews seemed well
matched
In the second division the
IC coxed four probably had
their best row so far as
they raced E4+. They
gained about six seconds
on the IC E4- crew. After
this there was the long wait
for the results during which
everyone could reflect over
possible race times and
marvel at our coach, Bill
Mason for the courage he
showed wearing his latest
sweater.
The results were worth
waiting for. The coxed four
won both senior A and elite
events being the fastest
( coxed four. The senior A
coxless four also won their
event. So the club started
Jthe Head season with three
iwins out of a possible four
and hopes of building on
this start through the year.

IC 6 - LSE 3
Thanks to Ian for playing
very well??!! (Now I've
mentioned him I can write
the real report).
A slight miscalculation by
LSE led to only five players
turning up, allowing IC to
claim three games before
the match started! (of
course even a complete
LSE team wouldn't have
had any effect on the final
' result!). The final result
was yet another victory for
the mens third team.
Thanks go to the team of
Guip, Ian, Jon, Kin, Ping
and Steve.
IC Ladies 9 - Sussex 0
Yet another astounding
victory for IC Ladies, who
have yet to lose a match
(or even a game!!)—Sussex
proving even less trouble
than LSE last week (who
had the audacity to score 7
points off us), went down
without taking a single
point from us, or even
having a serve or hitting
the shuttle.in fact, they
didn't even turn up, leaving
us with a 9—0 victory.
Thanks to the team oi Anne
Ftedley, Helen Gregory,
Helen Mondy, Robin Martin,
Sarah Threadgold and
Susan Yates.
Golf
Imperial College opened
their UAU challenge with a
convincing 5-1 win over
Sussex University. Most
impressive was the
powerful postgrad
Jakubovic, who led the IC
team home but claimed he
could not find the bar in
time to buy the first round.
J Gamblin and D Tierney
completely demoralised
their opponents with some •
fine wooden shots. Finally;
came disappointing
performances from the two
hackers of the side M Cox
and D Lang who just
managed to hack, shank
and top as well as their
opponents.
D Jakubovic beat D CastellO
7/6
J Morris beat B Cobbs 6/5 M
D Tierney beat D Kemp 4/2-
J Gambon beat D Lewn 4/3,
D Lang halved with C
Tremlett
M Cox halved with T Harris
(Non playing captain C I
Harrison generally tried to 1
scrounge as many halves
as possible)
FELIX Friday 1 November 13
