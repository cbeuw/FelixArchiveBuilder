Man in the Eye
Peter Hallsworth
If you're in College accommodation and your roof
leaks, the floor's rotten or the windows haven't been
cleaned the man ultimately resposible is Peter
Hallworth. His full title is Managing Surveyor
(Residences) and his role is to centrally administer the
maintenance and up-grading of buildings and the
administration of housekeepers and cleaners. This
week FELIX interviewed Mr Hallworth to hear his views
on the existing housing stock and the recent
improvement programme he has begun.
Peter Hallworth is a quiet,
well-spoken man who's title
seems far too grand to sit
comfortably on his
shoulders. Despite this he
is a competent
administrator who has
successfully coordinated
general maintenance and
the recent major works
since his transfer from
Estates to the new post in
May 1984. He describes his
role as 'providing a cost-
effective service which will
maintain and improve the
current College residence
stock to ensure residences
are kept to a comfortable
and reasonable standard
for the residents.'. Mr
Hallsworth also makes
inspections of Head
Tenancies and with regard
to Hamlet Gardens said
tentatively 'We must
continue to persuade the
landlords there to improve
each year and upgrade
those properties as much
as we can.'
Three major renovation
projects began over the
summer, all under Mr
Hallsworths control.
Compulsory repairs were
made to Willis Jackson
House to bring it into line
with the Housing Acts and
these were completed just
before the start of term. In
addition to the legal
requirements three
bathrooms were converted
into double showers and
extensive areas of dry rot
were discovered and
repaired. This work in
Evelyn Gdns is just the
beginning of a rolling
programme, including the
current external repairs,
which will see all the
houses upgraded by the
end of 1987-88.
Improvements were also
made to Montplelier over
the summer vacation
including the complete
refurbishment of the top
floor. Asked for his
opinions on the residences
Security has long been a
problem in Southside with
the doors frquently being
wedged open or simply not
locking after people; 'Even
when you have mechanical
closing systems they can
be wedged open. This puts
extra strain on hinges and
springs which are
frequently readjusted.
There is no real answer
other than people
physically closing doors
behind them.' Steps are
being taken to improve the
situation; the Selkirk door
has already been changed
and are improvements
about to be made at the
West end. Once the new
doors are all in place an
electro-magnetic locking
system will be made
operational on the second
doors to replace the old
electric bolt type. As Mr
Hallsworth frankly admits,
'The 'Betalock' electric
latches fitted to the top of
the doors have proved to
be a complete failure.' He
also agreed that if this new
lock was unsatisfactory the
only real answer would be
to man both of the doors.
Over the last vacation the
Hall laundries on Gallery
Levels in Southside were
removed and this has led to
many complaints that the
central laundrette in the
basement cannot cope.
'The central laundrette was
installed with a view to
removing Hall laundries
from gallery levels so that
kitchen facilities could be
improved. It was opened in
Mr Hallsworth said, '/ think
some of the Halls,
particularly Linstead and
. Weeks, are of a very
reasonable standard in
both accommodation and
facilities. Places like
Montpelier do need a
considerable amount of
work but we have started
some of that this year.'
The major concerns over
Southside are mainly the
fire alarm, security and the
laundry facilities. While the
fire alarm is not Mr
Hallsworth's direct concern
he said 'It is well known
that the fire alarm system is
not satisfactory in
Southside building and
there is no point denying
that fact. I know that
Maintenance Services
Section is actively engaged
in solving the problems and
I think it has improved in
recent months.'
June '84 and fitted out with
equipment equal to that in
the Halls, 8 washing
machines and 4 tumble
dryers. Knowing the Hall
laundries were to be taken
out of use I have installed
an extra tumble dryer, a
spin dryer and a sink to
upgrade the facilities. The
usage is obviously very
great and a number of
complaints have been
raised with regards to the
inadequacy of the provision
there. With the new
proposals to leave Selkirk
and Tizzard kitchens on
gallery level it may well be
possible to bring the
Selkirk laundry and drying
room back into use. This
will give extra facilities to
the 72 students in that Hall
and ease the load on the
central laundry.'
Mr Hallsworth was quick to
deny the allegation that
Halls are receiving a
disproportionate amount of
the funds available. While
he could not allow the
Halls to deteriorate he
envisaged the majority of
funds available would be
spent on the Houses. This
is confirmed in the
conclusions of his current
report to the Student
Residence Cttee, 'During
the last financial year
priority has been given to
ensuring that the main
areas of neglected
maintenance and repairs to
the residence stock are
attended to.... The priority
already given to improving
the standard of
accommodation, facilities
and equipment in Houses
will continue in the year
1985/86.'
The impression given by Mr
Hallsworth is that of steady
improvement without
complacency. Often fairly
minor improvements, such
as ensuringthe windows
are cleaned properly, are a
major task. Though his
budget runs into tens of
thousands of pounds, funds
are still limited in a world
where the estimated cost of
elevator refurbishment in
Tizzard is Â£65 000. Mr
Hallsworth does remain
optimistic however, 'Over
the last 18 months I've
been particularly
challenged by a complex
and difficult job, and on the
whole I've received the
cooperation and
understanding of the vast
majority of people who
have a vested interest in
student accommodation. I
look forward to another
year where we can see a
good measure of
improvement within the
College residences.'
