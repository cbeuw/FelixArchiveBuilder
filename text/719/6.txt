I
By Ratfink
I have to begin this week
with a minor correction to
last week's column. The
female fresher which Mr
Tony Spencer, failed
Broadsheet editor, was
seen escorting back to
Evelyn Gardens was in fact
male. Sorry Tony.
Speaking of editors,
however, brings me round
to a field always rich in
eccentricity. Probably as a
result of the fact that
editing any college
publication requires a
warped mind and a degree
of dedicated lunancy these
I people rarely have a low
: profile. Our own exhalted
;
editor Hugh Southey is
| already known for his wild
! mannerisms, hopping
(around and waving his
arms in the air. Indeed so
hyperactive is Mr Southey
that one person already
this term confused his
normal behaviour with an
overdose of amphetamine
diet pills. Is the strain of
editorship getting to the
man? Jokingly it has been
suggested that Mr Southey
is in fact the psychotic
phantom soaker still at
large in College. And now
to fuel this rumour comes
the story that when one
FELIX reporter went to
check the handwriting the
letter published in last
weeks FELIX had vanished
without trace!
The most deranged
editors of all are those of
the C C U papers of course.
Now, following the
temporary departure from
college of previous editor
Mark Cottle, Guildsheet has
been largely in the hands
of the progressively more
rotund duplicating officer
Adrian Johnson. Mr Cottle
himself gained a certain
notoriety before untimely
brain damage and personal
circumstances terminated
his reign, but Mr Johnson
has been trying hard for
the really big league.
Cuddly Adrian's escapades
occur at night when he
sleepwalks. During the
summer he developed a
tendency to get into bed
with his room mates in the
middle of the nighf. So
deep was his trance that
the only means Guilds V P
Symon Corns could find to
repel the invasion was
several swift blows across
the backside with a shoe
(kinky these Guildsmen).
Following this our hero
transfered his attention to
the wardrobe, in which he
found himself awakening
one morning. The final and
most gross tale occured
after one of the Guilds
freshers buffets when the
rotund one was 'crashing
out' in a friends nearby
room. The slumbering
wanderer found the urge
on this occasion to relieve
himself during his travels,
and picked as his spot his
host's bed. Truly a man
with Carl Burgess
credibility!
And I couldn't round off
wjthout another dose of
'Northeyballs'. Uncle Robs
worst blow to his credibility
so far reported is to have
been drunk under the table
by ICU non-entity and DP
Dave Kingston. This
occured during the early
hours of the morning after
bar boycotter Dave and our
refectory manager had
been concocting some
amazing plans at Rob's
Princes Gardens flat.
The event had been
preceded by Commem Day
Ball. Hard luck Rob, but full
points for trying to see
your critics side of things.
