H o l l y w o o d ' s fatal flaws. In this case,
it's Jack Frost, a m o v i e w h i c h b a s e s

His name's Jack Frost - Just how cruel were his parents?
that t h e lead character is w e a r i n g t h e

but Toys R Us c o s t u m e s ? I think not.
D e s p i t e t h e fact that Jack Frost has
' C h r i s t m a s holidays' written all over,
it's b e i n g r e l e a s e d in February thanks
to t h e traditional lag b e t w e e n U S a n d

Despite t h e fact that it's not released
until next Friday, This Year's Love has
already b e e n touted as this year's Full
Monty o r Four Weddings. H o w e v e r ,
whilst such c o m p a r i s o n s m i g h t m a k e
y o u think o f a n easy g o i n g , v a g u e l y
romantic, c o m e d y , w h a t y o u actually
get is a m u c h grittier slice o f life. A cross
b e t w e e n M i k e Leigh a n d Men Behaving
Badly might be nearer the truth.
It's u n d o u b t e d l y g o i n g t o b e well
worth seeing, a n d , thanks to the O d e o n
Kensington, y o u can catch it for free. To
pick up a pair o f tickets, all y o u have t o
do is answer t h e f o l l o w i n g q u e s t i o n :
Which American actress will star
In Nottlng Hill, this summer's
follow-up to Four Weddings'?
If y o u k n o w , then e m a i l your a n s w e r s

day e v e n i n g . The first five n a m e s out of
the virtual hat will w i n a pair o f tickets.
I'm sorry for the delay in printing t h e

here they are:

There w e r e in fact t w o correct answers
to the competition - T o m Stoppard wrote
both The Fifteen Minute Hamlet a n d
Rosencrantz and Guildcnstcrn Arc Dead
- so either movie w a s a c c e p t e d .

Armageddon
A r m a g e d d o n has taken a lot o f abuse
since its release last A u g u s t - largely
b e c a u s e (thanks to Godzilla a n d The
Avengers) every action m o v i e released
last s u m m e r w a s d e c r e e d poor. How-
ever such criticism is unfair as, unlike
most o f last year's other blockbuster
offerings, Armageddon delivered what
it p r o m i s e d - b i g explosions, an all star
cast, s o m e light relief f r o m Steve
B u s c c m i , s o m e d a m n impressive CGI
a n d effects, a n d an unremitting m o u n -
tain o f c h e e s e .
As l o n g as y o u accept that this is a
Jerry B r u c k h e i m e r film (translation:
cheesy, action p a c k e d a n d edited like
MTV), a n d rent t h e v i d e o o n that
premise, then you'll enjoy it. After all,
movies are s u p p o s e d t o be fun, aren't
they?
Kissing A Fool
Put together three simple c o m p o n e n t s :
a b u n c h o f y o u n g A m e r i c a n writers; a
love triangle; a n d a star of Friends (David
S c h w i m m e r ) . A recipe for disaster,
surely? Well, surprisingly, no. Admittedly,
it's not particularly great either, but it's
u n d e n i a b l y c o m p e t e n t , acceptably
entertaining, a n d wittily written. M o r e
importantly, c o n s i d e r i n g t h e time o f
year, it might be prudent lo suggest this
as an ideal movie to rent for a n evening
in with your girl/boyfriend (in o l h e r
w o r d s it's not totally a b s o r b i n g , y o u
won't look sad/soppy/adolescent if y o u
rent it, a n d if everything g o e s a bit Pete
T o n g it's not actually a b a d movie).
Paulie
Here w e g o again. Lassie a n d Flipper
really d o have a lot to answer for. Babe
a n d Free Willywete acceptable, but the
recent flood o f talking animal based
m o v i e s b e g i n s to grate. This t i m e
around the mutant pet in question is the
e p o n y m o u s Paulie, a fast-talking par-
rot, n o less. Having 'lost' his first owner
( y o u n g Hallie Kate Lisenberg), h e
s p e n d s the rest of his life attempting to
find her again. In actual fact, it's fun,
k n o c k a b o u t stuff, ideal for your little
brother (should y o u h a p p e n to be ham-
pered by such a n annoyance) - I've just
got a p e r s o n a l v e n d e t t a against the
entire genre. Sorry. D
