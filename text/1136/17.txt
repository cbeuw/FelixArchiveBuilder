AIDS Day, a stress buster to coincide (as
close as possible) with exams and a m e n -

student representation is fair a n d ade-
quate across all departments.

Felix is the primary source o f information
for students at Imperial, s o it's vital that
it presents e n o u g h material for students
to reach their o w n opinions o n key issues
- whilst t h e reporting itself remains unbi-
ased. To this end, I'll introduce regular In-
depth features o n t h e major student
issues - like ULU, fees a n d College expan-
sion - so that everyone has a c h a n c e to
u n d e r s t a n d w h a t ' s really g o i n g o n .
Proper dissemination of Information also
means proper distribution, s o I'll ensure
that Felix hits every c a m p u s o n t h e s a m e
day, a n d a p p e a r s o n t h e w e b every
week.
Clubs a n d societies s h o u l d have t h e
opportunity to tell everyone what they
do. Consequently, I'll provide space for
every club to write reviews of events or
p r e v i e w u p c o m i n g activity. Similarly,
sports coverage needs to be improved,
with a dedicated t e a m of reporters a n d
photographers to cover matches at Har-
lington, C o b h a m and Teddington. Finally,
both ICU a n d the Constituent College
U n i o n s s h o u l d b e given space to report:
on their activities a n d justify thei
- thus m a k i n g our representatives m o i
accountable.
Felix is a club, a n d like any other a l
Imperial ii must be o p e n lo all \s v

than having to dedicate their lives to the

ensure as w i d e a range of contributors

New Election
Ok. N o w N e w Election, or R e - o p e l |
N o m i n a t i o n s ( R O N ) allows y o u to
express your dissatisfaction with t h e can-
didates presented to y o u . So if y o u don't
like t h e current candidates w e can s e e
if m o r e will stand.
Now... this is not a decision to b e
taken lightly. Will a n y better candidates
stand? A very important question to ask
a n d o n e y o u will also have to answer
your self. I suggest y o u c o m e a l o n g to
llPfe Hustings if possible a n d c o m p a r e
people. Otherwise read the manifestos
a n d speak to people. A b o v e all make an
i n f o r m e d decision.
R O N has always b e e n a p o p u l a r
choice with the students o f Imperial, t h e
reasons w h y are obvious. This candidate
is not standing o n any platform a n d has
n o h i d d e n a g e n d a s to fulfil. In fact R O N
is the only candidate y o u can fully trust.
Also it keeps t h e masses entertained
with those well-attended 2nd round o f
elections.
O f c o u r s e this next year is very
important for both the U n i o n a n d the
world. M a y b e it could be that R O N is the
perfect candidate to lead us all into the
n e w m i l l e n n i u m ?!?
