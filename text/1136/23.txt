CASSIUS
Cassius partying like it's 1999.
T
his C D is t h e result o f t h e t e n
year p a r t n e r s h i p b e t w e e n
french producers Phillipc Zdar
and Hubert BlancT rancarl, as well as
m a n y other artists they have b e e n t h e
producers o f choice for french rap 'star'
M C Solaar. S o there.
Basically, this C D is chock full o f large
french beats, m e s s e d u p vocal samples
a n d t h e occasionally l o o p e d m o n k e y .
Phillipe a n d I lubert really s h o w off their
mastery o f the 303 beat box with this
a l b u m - y o u can hear that distinctive hi-
hat o n practically every track - this is n o
bad thing but it d o e s e n d up s o u n d i n g
rather dated s o m e t i m e s . But I s u p p o s e
o n e man's dated is another man's retro.
The a l b u m is certainly a m i x e d bag, with
o c c a s i o n a l tracks s o u n d i n g postively
annorexic in their production, a n d others
e n d u p s o c r a m m e d full o f beats that
they threaten t o fuse your speakers.
Cassius don't stray m u c h f r o m t h e
well established 'build it up, knock it
d o w n ' s c h o o l o f dance muisic p r o d u c -
tion. They sculpt the beats into a roar o f
bass a n d then pull it all away - leaving
only a solitary vocal or l o o p e d sample.
While they are firmly e n t r e n c h e d in the
late '90s h a p p y clappy h o u s e s o u n d ,
their earlier roots are there for everyone
to s e e . With a South Park C h e f - e s q u c
sample l o o p e d o n o n e o f the standout
tracks of the album, Hey Babe they s h o w
their respect for 7 0 s funk w h i c h h a s
u n d o u b t e d l y influenced t h e m a great
deal. Most o f the beats in the a l b u m are
electronically g e n e r a t e d , but Cassius d o
d e p l o y varied African percussion a n d
m a k e great u s e o f bizarre samples - as
well as the previously m e n t i o n e d m o n -
key o n Invisible, violins are used occas-
sionally but effectively.
With sixteen tracks o n this a l b u m
Cassius certainly deliver value for money,
w h i l e not every track is quite u p to the
infectious beats a n d delicious funk of Ihe
m o n s t e r hit Cassius 1999, there a r e
e n o u g h little g e m s a n d s o u ! t h u m p i n g
m o m e n t s to raise this LI5
above the stan-
dard. S t a n d o u t tracks include, Some-
body Nulife a n d t h e previously
m e n t i o n e d Hey Babe a n d Invisible.
Cassisus a r e a n o t h e r great b a n d
f r o m the French revival that s e e m s to
have b e e n h a p p e n i n g recently. They join
Daft Punk a n d Air as bands to watch in
the n e w m i l l e n i u m - 1999 is a great w a y
to finish it. EH

THE KYND
Shakedown £
P
ower-pop-tastic! Jangly guitars!
Nasal vocals! I've really taken to
these guys. This type o f music is
rare these days. The w h o l e a l b u m , to
m e at least, is full o f p o p s o n g s that
s o u n d like the band want to have fun,
a n d they w a n t y o u to, even more. Let's
reminisce over the '60s shall we?
The insert to the a l b u m doesn't give
m u c h away: n o lyrics a n d only t h e
briefest o f a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t s a n d infor-
mation. However, it d o c s s h o w that three
of the b a n d still think the old 'Liam a n d
N o e l ' haircut (circa 1994) is cool. I think
w e can forgive t h e m o n the grounds that
this is o n e hell o f an a l b u m . Actually no,
that's the w r o n g phrase; it's m o r e of a n
exceptional o n e . I'll explain: I don't think
that The Kynd w o u l d like m c to use the
w o r d 'hell' or any other b l a s p h e m o u s or
abusive w o r d s for that matter. They look
t o o w h o l e s o m e a n d W a l t o n i s h , they
could b e smacked-up t o t h e eyeballs,
but if they are they d o a g o o d j o b o f hid-
ing it.
I don't k n o w their influences but I'd
bet a w a d of money that Madchester had
a lot to d o with their particular brand o f
sonic entertainment, along with '60s p o p
a n d rock 'n' roll (same as every other
band, then). But their s o u n d isn't as sim-
ilar to all those indie bands that have
g o n e before them. The first track, World's
Finest could b e ripped o f f a G r e e n Day
a l b u m , except it's a lot m o t e musically
a d e p t , a n d G r e e n D a y w o u l d n ' t b e
caught d e a d with a t a m b o u r i n e . As w e
spin our w a y through t h e a l b u m at a
heady 33 1/3 rpm w e encounter, inten-
tionally or no, sly winks a n d clandestine
nods to a n u m b e r o f other bands o f the
s a m e ilk. W e have a copy o f Cast o n
Almost There w h i c h I liked, a l t h o u g h
Cast irritate m e greatly. There's an Inspi-
ral Carpets-csquc ditty in Chestnut a n d a
milder version of O C S o n If You Think This
Is Easy... This, a l o n g with Egotripperand
the beatific, if slightly corny English Girl
Walking is a stand out track. Three out of
eleven ain't bad. The a l b u m as a w h o l e
has a full-on hippie revival t h e m about it,
albeit with a c o n t e m p o r a r y twist. Ihe
ideals are there but there's a m o d e r n feel
mixed into that retro catchiness. This, it
has to b e said, is a g o o d thing. H
