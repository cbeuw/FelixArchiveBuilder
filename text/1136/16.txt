Tim Trailor
Next year will b e o n e of t h e most chal-
lenging years faced by t h e D P (C&S). Ail
clubs a n d societies a r e f a c i n g a n
upheaval o f o n e kind or another. M a n y
of t h e societies based in South Kens-
ington will b e a c q u i r i n g n e w facilities
courtesy of t h e U n i o n s e x p a n s i o n into
w h a t w a s until recently t h e B i o l o g y
department, but probably t h e biggest
cloud still h a n g i n g over t h e h e a d o f next
years DP (C&S) will b e t h e ICSM m e r g e r
issue. What with t h e ICSMRFC having
s h o w n t hems elve s t o b e a force t o b e
reckoned with it is n o w as imperative as
ever that t h e unique identity o f ICSM a n d
ICU teams is preserved. A s a m e m b e r o f
the ICU Hockey Club Exec and as a re-app
(in a hall containing m a n y medics) I have
b e e n well placed over this past year to
observe w h a t y o u want from your clubs
a n d societies. I believe that it is essential
that next years D P (C&S) is s o m e o n e
with a great deal o f k n o w l e d g e c o n -
cerning t h e merger a n d t h e position that
most sporting clubs at Imperial will face
over the next 18 months. A n y b o d y tak-
ing over as D P (C&S) w h o doesn't have
a firm background within a sporting c lub
w o u l d not h a w llii' ahilil, lo tc |)li ,
< ;:i
y o u a n d your U n i o n appropriately to
organisations s u c h as BUSA a n d U L U .
I believe that I ha\< got the neces-
sary g r o u n d i n g within the sporting fra-
ternity to repn -sent t h e m well along with
the iii-sin to listen to a n d supporl the:
other clubs a n d societies. It is these qual-
ities a l o n g with a passionate desire to d o
this job, a n d d o it well, that w o u l d m a k e
m e an excellent candidate for the j o b -
so vote for m e for D P (C&S)!
vilal release: from sludy, a chance lo play
their sport, to develop their interests a n d
generally have a spanking g o o d time, the
U n i o n must be fair a n d supportive. The
d e v e l o p m e n t o f a n e w relationship
b e t w e e n t h e m e d i c a l schools a n d t h e
rest of IC is in full s w i n g b u l there are
b o u n d to b e m o r e issues to address.
Conc e r ns recently voiced by Kash Akhtar
regarding f u n d i n g for transport are a
g o o d example, a n d w e must realise that
we're n o w a team a n d n e e d to w o r k
t o g e l h e r to o v e r c o m e such p r o b l e m s . A
strong foundation for health a n d safety
policy has b e e n built over the last f e w
years a n d I intend l o c o n t i n u e building
a system that provides peace of m i n d for
all c o n c e r n e d . I a i m to support societies
by proactive representation - tailoring
policy to try a n d meet everybody's needs
a n d creating active relationships with
clubs a n d t h e c o m m i t t e e s w h o m a n a g e
t h e m . T h r o u g h g o o d c o m m u n i c a t i o n I
can fight for what t h e majority of union
m e m b e r s want. Give m c your vote a n d
I'll give y o u a 1 1 0 % c o m m i t m e n t to rep-
resenting your interests.

I've b e e n Involved In ICU for four years,

standing of the workings of the U n i o n

giving m e the tools I n e e d for the job. I'm
sociable, a p p r o a c h a b l e a n d willing to try
