ICU President
Andy Swiff m
Living and studying in L o n d o n is b e c o m -
ing increasingly difficult. It is important,
as President, to concentrate o n t h e d a y
to day issues that really affect student life,
as well as l o o k i n g into h o w t h e U n i o n
can develop into t h e future. Over t h e last
f e w years Imperial College a n d its U n i o n
have u n d e r g o n e m a n y c h a n g e s . This
trend is set to continue. The merger with
Wye College, the r e d e v e l o p m e n t o f Beit
Q u a d a n d the possible disaffiliation with
ULU will b e a m o n g s t t h e key issues that
will d o m i n a t e m y role as President.
Over m y time here at Imperial I have
b e e n involved in a multitude o f varied
student activities, including a DJ at ICU,
to a team captain a n d n o w Club Presi-
dent o f ICLJ AFC, a n d most importantly
part of the inaugural t e a m for the IC
S u m m e r Ball. It is this varied b a c k g r o u n d
that sets m e apart as t h e best candidate
for t h e position.
As President, I will m a k e il m y key
objective l o ensure that ICU provides
you with the services you want. A divided
U n i o n benefits n o b o d y . A united U n i o n ,
w h i c h works together, c a n bring about
c h a n g e a n d g e t results. I want a U n i o n
w h e r e you m a k e a difference, a U n i o n
w h e r e your o p i n i o n s count a n d a U n i o n
that we c a n progress into t h e 21st C e n -
tury.

I c o m e to these elections unsullied by
the bureaucratic canker of U n i o n politics.
It might b e true that I k n o w less a b o u t
h o w the u n i o n is run than m a y b e s o m e
other candidates but this allows m e to
see the U n i o n not as it is but h o w it
should b e .
The union is like a n old friend to m e .
I have b e e n trampled into its football
pitch, d i s m e m b e r e d in its kung-fu class,
hunted d o w n by its archery club a n d
chased o f f its stages. It has f e d , w a t e r e d
and entertained m e , but recently I have
b e c o m e d i s e n c h a n t e d as m y o l d friend
has b e c o m e e n g u l f e d in a mire o f red-
tape (if y o u d o u b t m e just look at t h e
rules c o n c e r n i n g election c a m p a i g n s ) .
M e a n w h i l e , Imperial College: has
g a i n e d a reputation for its quality, such
that w e arc: seen to rival a n d even sur-
pass O x f o r d a n d C a m b r i d g e . It there-
fore galls m e to s e e h o w short-changed
w e are. A C a m b r i d g e d e g r e e is consid-
ered in the same light as o n e from Impe-
rial, yet theirs is a reputation hunt >
n
seven m o r e w e e k s of holiday than us.
This is hardly fair. What is m o r e m y short
vacations are s q u a n d e r e d , a n d valuable
revision time wasted for w a n t of g o o d
lecture notes a n d the a b s e n c e o f freely
available m o d e l examination solutions.
W h i c h is just like b e i n g given a lock but
no key. To improve this situation, I pro-
pose a n e w a n d i m p r o v e d system of
d e p a r t m e n t a l representatives, w h o
w o u l d work h a n d in hand with the U n i o n
to give y o u a greater say in the content
of your courses. I his is particularly impor-
tant with Ihe arrival of the: tuition fees
(which I a m bitterly o p p o s e d to), as y o u
a n d therefore your financial investment
should b e given the best conditions in
w h i c h to flourish.
As a final w o r d : e v e n if y o u don't
v o l e for m e m a k e sure y o u do v o l e .
Please don't b e (a)pathetic.
