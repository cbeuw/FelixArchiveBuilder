Staff Salaries Sky High
By Andrew Ofori
Imperial College n o w boasts the largest
number o f well-paid staff for a publicly
funded British higher education institute,
according to recent HEFCE accounts.
325 college staff earned in excess of
£50, 000 last academic year a n d a further
22 staff earned more than £100, 000. The
figures were the country's highest in their
respective categories and spearheaded the
supremacy of London colleges in the salary
stakes. UCL placed second with 277 staff
earning over £50,000 and 21 earning above
£100, 000. Completing London's s w e e p
was King's in third with 183 people earning
over £50,000 a n d 6 bringing in over £100,
000 last year. The capital's cost o f living is
partly responsible for the top-flight salaries.
But many of the highly paid hailed from
medical schools a n d universities strongly
linked with industry.
London's dominance has placed pres-
sure o n the Oxbridge colleges, amongst
others, to enhance their salaries: 115 a n d
121 staff earned over £50, 000 at Oxford
and Cambridge respectively.
The top job at London Business School
was the most lucrative vice-chancellor's
position they paid the three individuals
w h o filled the role a staggering £207, 000
pro rata. The LBS also had the country's
highest paid academic based at a publicly
funded institute, w h o earned in excess o f
£220, 000. Vice-chancellors nation-wide
prospered last year receiving an average
pay rise of 4.8%, surpassing inflation. Impe-
rial's rector Sir Ronald Oxburgh placed 55th
in the country earning £111,000 in 1997-98.
The Association o f University Teachers
wished to see the trend reflected through-
out University staff, with their assistant gen-
eral secretary commenting: 'There is n o
doubt that vice-chancellors deserve every
penny, but a university's achievements-
d e p e n d o n all its staff as much as the indi-
vidual at the top...we don't begrudge vice-
chancellors their pay increase but yet again
they are paying themselves a far greater
increase than they do their staff. W e wait
to hear o f a vice-chancellor w h o refuses to
take a bigger pay rise than his staff. W e sus-
pect it will be a long wait."
IC completed its copious expenditure
o n staff with colossal redundancy pay-offs.
Four members of staff earning over £50,
000 a year, received £338, 000 in c o m p e n -
sation for loss o f office.
In the wake o f the HEFCE figures, the
House O f C o m m o n s technology commit-
tee heard a plea from Sir Keith Peters to
double professors' salaries. Sir Peters, head
of Cambridge University, suggested a n
increasing the current professoriate salary
from around £41, 000 to £80, 000, in order
to make allowances for moving and setting
up home. "Americans just laugh at us"
stated Sir Alec Broers, Cambridge vice-chan-
cellor as he spoke of h o w his university was
unable to attract researchers from industry
and abroad. The request will be subject to
a ballot of academia later this month.
