British f o o d has received m o r e than its fair share of crit-
icism. The p r o b l e m is typical o f this country, rooted in
a view o f f o o d for s u s t e n a n c e rather than pleasure. As
attitudes start t o c h a n g e , w e ' v e a d o p t e d m o r e a n d
m o r e foreign recipes into o u r diet. But w h a t o u r native
cuisine traditionally lacks in flavour, is m o r e than m a d e
up in the sheer w a r m t h a n d w h o l e n e s s o f t h e f o o d .
Even t h e harshest critics o f British f o o d are often still
partial to a slice o f roast meat, a Yorkshire p u d d i n g or
a little fruit cake. W e n o w n e e d to take a fresh look at
British c o o k i n g . With a little w o r k to avoid the typical
flavour drain, s o m e o f our o w n f o o d c a n b e really spe-
cial.
S a u s a g e s a c c o m p a n i e d b y m a s h e d p o t a t o a r e
great example of a traditional British meal. W h e n m a d e
well, it c a n taste fantastic. Nigel Slater describes per-
fectly t h e j o y that is bangers a n d m a s h , particularly in
his latest b o o k Real Food.
Sausages
I subscribe to t h e sausage c o o k i n g p h i l o s o p h y
advocated by M a t t h e w fort o f the G u a r d i a n . For m c ,
the only m e t h o d is to c o o k t h e m really slowly in a p a n .
The sausages must b e g o o d quality, preferably from a
butcher.
The m e t h o d couldn't b e simpler. Just put t h e m in
a frying p a n over a really l o w heat, a n d c o o k for about
an hour. Slow c o o k i n g m e a n s there's n o n e e d t o
pierce t h e skin. N o holes m e a n s n o loss o f juices, but
the semi-permeable skin o f g o o d sausages d o e s allow
fat to slowly s e e p out, f o r m i n g a fantastic sticky g o o
that m a k e s t h e wait totally worthwhile.
Mashed Potato
School mash, m a d e from p o w d e r a n d served with
a scoop. Even n o w the mere thought makes m e cringe,
so it's strange that proper m a s h e d potato n o w ranks
a m o n g s t m y favourite foods. The only essentials are
Cooks
Corner
real potato, a n d s o m e t h i n g to moisten it up. Potatoes
c o m e in t w o basic types: waxy, a n d floury. I g o a l o n g
with Nigel Slater's verdict that mash is best m a d e from
the floury varieties, such as Maris Piper, Desiree or King
Edwards.
Peel a n d c h o p t h e potatoes, then boil as usual.
Drain the p a n , then put it back o n t h e heat for a
minute or so. this extra drying increases fluffiness. Use
a hand masher to squash t h e potato, then a d d the
extras. I normally stick in s o m e butter a n d milk. Sur-
prisingly, milk tastes far better than c r e a m in mash. A n
alternative is to use olive oil instead of the milk and but-
ter. A d d i n g c h o p p e d parsley or basil m a k e s another
g o o d variation.
Onion Gravy
A great a c c o m p a n i m e n t for sausages a n d mash.
O n i o n gravy c a n have almost as m u c h flavour as meat
gravy.
1 large o n i o n
about SOg butter
half t a b l e s p o o n flour
quarter pint o f stock
Worcestershire sauce
Salt a n d Pepper
M e l t t h e butter in a large s a u c e p a n . Peel a n d
c h o p the o n i o n . C o o k slowly with a lid for about twenty
minutes, until t h e o n i o n g o e s really b r o w n . Stick in the
flour, then c o o k for a further m i n u t e . A d d t h e stock
slowly, mixing all the time. Season with salt, pepper and
Worcestershire sauce, then turn d o w n t h e heat and
b u b b l e for a further 15.
