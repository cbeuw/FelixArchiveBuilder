Whiplash a Winner
Dear Felix,
In response to Whiplash I w o u l d just like
to congratulate t h e u n i o n for at last hav-
ing a night a i m e d at those w h o like
heavy alternative music a n d thank those
w h o arranged it. The music played w a s
incredibly varied a n d had s o m e t h i n g for
everyone w h e t h e r they like punk, hard-
core, industrial, goth or just heavy metal.
I never t h o u g h t that I w o u l d hear White
Z o m b i e b e i n g played in the union a n d I
was glad to hear Marilyn M a n s o n b e i n g
heard in dB's o n c e m o r e (I believe t h e
first t i m e w a s last D e c e m b e r ' s World
AIDS Day party). Hopefully this w a s just
the first of a regular night. M y only c o m -
plaint, it w a s o n a Saturday instead o f a
Friday w h e n it w o u l d have drawn an
even larger c r o w d .

Defend Free Education
Dear Felix,
Last w e e k I read a n article in t h e excel-
lent electronic n e w s p a p e r , SchNEWS,
w h i c h I have to share with y o u . The sub-
ject is close to all our hearts, our e d u c a -
tion. In this country w e have seen what
a m o u n t s to t h e privatisation of our e d u -
cation system by t h e i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of
policies such as the nation curriculum in
schools to the tailoring of degree courses
in universities to t h e needs o f business
a n d industry, not p e o p l e or t h e planet.
This year w e have s e e n t h e t h e g o v e r n -
ments' latest nail in the coffin o f e d u c a -
tion for all, tuition fees are n o w a reality.
Yet w e are not alone, other governments
have also b e e n 'reforming' the education
systems in their c o u n t r i e s . H o w e v e r ,
these reforms are attracting so m u c h
m o r e resistance a b r o a d then in Britain
that it puts us to s h a m e .
In Greece, pupils a n d teachers have
j o i n e d forces to o p p o s e t h e i m p l e m e n -
tation of t h e 2525/97 Act w h i c h seeks to
link e d u c a t i o n directly to t h e n e e d s a n d
fluctuations o f t h e e c o n o m y . The Act,
introduced nearly a year a g o a n d billed
as "a broad reform o f t h e education sys-
t e m " means, in reality, intensification o f
