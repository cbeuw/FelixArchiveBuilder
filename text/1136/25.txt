A slupid s o u n d i n g tillc for o n e o f the
weirdest LPs I have ever heard. It's the
follow up to the successful ' M u s i c is
Rotted O n e Note', a n d is a scries of
recorded live tracks with stupid titles
such as Lambic 5 Poetry, V a r k a p h o n c
a n d G o n g A c i d . You think that's
strange? Wait until you've heard the
music. It's a collection of strange nois-
es - o n e particular track s o u n d s as
t h o u g h s o m e o n e has walked inro a
giant w i n d c h i m e a n d then recorded It.
The rest of the tunes aren't better - if
anything, i h c y arc worse. If I had lo
give it s o m e sort of description, I
w o u l d say it is a weird collection of
chilled-out m e l o d i c sounds. A n d if I
was to be honest - strange s o u n d i n g
crap. This is s o m e t h i n g for a very spe-
cialised market, so if y o u like w i n d
c h i m e s a n d d o d g y beats then this is for
y o u . I advise y o u to buy Jimi Tenor's
a l b u m (also o n Warp Records) instead.
