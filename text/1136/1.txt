Teddington Faces Axe: Cobham Next?
A n e w College report threatens a radical
shake-up o f student sports provision, a n d
ultimately suggests the sell-off o f t w o of
Imperial's three sports grounds.
The report, based o n a survey of sports
usage from September 1997 to December
1998, r e c o m m e n d s that " t h e C o l l e g e
should a i m to cater for the o u t d o o r sports
at o n e location". This w o u l d almost cer-
tainly result in Harlington b e c o m i n g h o m e
to all club sport, as it is t h e only g r o u n d
with the capacity to cater for all o f IC's
needs.
However, whilst gravel extraction con-
tinues at the H e a t h r o w site (which is
scheduled for at least the next six years),
additional space will b e required. Thus, at
least o n e of the other grounds will earn a
short-term reprieve. The report notes that
a total provision o f a r o u n d 90 acres is
require; at present, Harlington provides 50

rying is complete), C o b h a m adds a further
50 acres, whilst Teddington provides only

12.5. Consequently, it is widely believed
that Teddington (historically h o m e to St
Mary's sport) has already been earmarked
for sale. Moreover, Teddington is undoubt-
IC Sport - h e a d i n g for Harlington?
edly the most attractive venue for prospec-
tive buyers, lying as it does in the centre
of a large residential estate - which also
means that, unlike the other two grounds,
there is n o potential for further develop-
ment. Ihe only real point in its favour
w o u l d s e e m to b e that it is the cheapest
ground to run, with a b u d g e l e d deficit of
[42 000 this year (compared with [43 500
for Harlington a n d [101 380 for Cobham).
O n a brighter note, however, the
report also r e c o m m e n d s that the switch in
focus to a single ground should allow "the
development o f a full range of high qual-
ity sports facilities", including an improved
pavilion a n d a m u c h broader range of all-
weather a n d floodlit pitches.
I he report w a s d u e to be discussed at
last Fhursday's m e e t i n g of College Athlet-
ics Committee, and although the outcome
w a s not k n o w n as Iclix w e n t to press,
senior U n i o n sources suggest that the
sale of Teddington is n o w almost certain.
"As far as College is concerned, w e don't
n e e d Teddington - a n d they're obviously
not g o i n g to ignore the massive amount
of m o n e y that the sale w o u l d generate...it
won't b e long before C o b h a m goes too".
"Lucky"
A student w h o fell f r o m t h e first floor o f

just a broken wrist. Ihe incident, w h i c h
occurred late in t h e e v e n i n g o f Friday 5
February, is t h e first o f its kind for several
years, but has still raised Issues c o n c e r n -

M a n a g e r , d e s c r i b e d t h e student as
"incredibly lucky... we're glad it wasn't
m o r e serious". H e also m e n t i o n e d that
the student a p p e a r e d to b e "under the
influence" of alcohol. Ihe accident has
necessarily raised concerns over safety.
Ian Oillett, Safety Director for the col-
lege, has b e e n in contact with the U n i o n
and has discussed whether further safety
precautions n e e d to b e taken. H e agreed
with M r H o m e that "to e n d u p with a bro-
ken wrist is extremely lucky". Ihe most
likely change is that a second steward will
be brought up to the first floor w h e n the
U n i o n Dining Hall is b e i n g cleared in
order, as M r Gillctl put it, "to monitor
behaviour o n the staircase."
