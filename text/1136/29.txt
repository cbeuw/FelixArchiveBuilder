FOOTBALL
L S E V 4 - 4 I C V
This was the t e a m that had thrashed us
7-1 way back in October in our first g a m e
of the season, so the return g a m e w a s
a b i g m a t c h - a n d t u r n e d out to be
another 8 goal thriller - this time e n d i n g
all square.
With JP still sidelined with an injured
finger, a n d M a r k v o w i n g never to be
stand-in Goalie again after Saturday, Stu
from the 4ths played for us today - but
was totally shit for the first goal for LSI; -
a w e a k shot f r o m the e d g e of the box
s o m e h o w g o i n g under his h a n d a n d
trickling into the net. Reeling f r o m this
bad start, a n d f r o m s o m e terrible refer-
eeing decisions, IC c a m e back well, a n d
w e r e s o o n level thanks to N i m a (I'm t o o
g o o d for the Sths) rolling the ball to T o m
(1-0 to the black & whites) Walker 25
yards out, w h o dispatched an unstop-
pable shot past their keeper.
But our record of having o n e of the
shortest teams ever seen s o o n proved a
p r o b l e m against a t e a m with strikers
twice our height, and from a corner they
scored again, 2-1.
Having scored his first IC goal, T o m
then struck again with a brilliant free
kick, over a n d r o u n d the wall. By half
time, LSE w e r e 3-2 up after another cor-
ner was h e a d e d in, but the V's never sur-
render, and it was 3-3 after great pressure
from our captain, A n d y "Let's w i n " Chiva
led to an o w n goal. Yet another header
gave LSL a 4-3 lead with 20 minutes to
go, a n d Adrian "lofty bastard" Mcfarlane
t o o k a bit of time to recover from a hard
hit football in the bollocks bravely block-
ing a shot. W e then feared than N i m a
might n e e d his leg a m p u t a t e d o n the
field of play, but it turned out to be a tiny
graze o n his knee - c u n n i n g delaying tac-
tics w h e n a goal b e h i n d , Nima...But still
not worried, IC c a m e back again with a
fantastic goal scored by Chris "Lazy Git"
Frazcr after great work by Tom "When he
s h o w s up" Lovell o n the right.
So, 4-4, a n d a great fighting away
point for IC V's - Let's win all our g a m e s
for the rest of the season boys!

A makeshift t e a m of last minute v o l u n -
teers f r o m civil e n g i n e e r i n g c o v e r e d
themselves in glory giving the s c u m m y
mechanicals a g o o d d r u b b i n g . By guts,
determination, skill and incisive finishing,
not to m e n t i o n the foresight to wear
boots instead of trainers in m u d d y c o n -
ditions, Ihe civ lis s h o w e d that they are
the t e a m to beat in this 5-a-side league.
The art of r u n n i n g circles r o u n d the
opposition has rarely b e e n m o r e effi-
ciently a c c o m p l i s h e d . Chris a n d Brad
both b a g g e d hat tricks, others may have
as well bul w e lost count. Even yours
truly got a goal, my first for three years!
O f course, w e had to allow t h e m o n e
consolation goal, a n d to be fair they
w e r e great sports, their heads never
w e n t d o w n - a n d most of their t e a m
were wearing trainers. I'm sure they'll be
keen to get their o w n back in the civil v
mechanical rugby match on Sunday 28lh
Feb. W e say ' c o m e o n then!'
Play football for your department; ask
your year rep about getting into a team.

The Continuing
saga of the split-

M o ' s b r e e c h e s c o n t i n u e d in true fash-
ion, just a b o u t m a n a g i n g l o see him
t h r o u g h the IC victory o f 18-9 over
Cardiff.
With our foil up first, a full t e a m for
a change, w e m a n a g e d to easily defeat
the y o u n g pretenders 7-2. A n excellent
p e r f o r m a n c e from our foilists, this gave
us the required impetus to defeat the
Cardiff t e a m .
Sabre u p next, a n d M o a n d
Thorstcn w o r k i n g in top gear, m a n a g e d
to w i n all their matches with ease, and
the a d d i t i o n o f D a v e " C a p l ' n Phill"
H u g h e s , help us w i n 7-2. Giving us the
victory with an entire w e a p o n in hand.
Epee b e g a n well, with Nigel "Old
G e e z e r " Davics m a n a g i n g to make it for
a first t e a m session for a change. Given
that L p e e is our t e a m ' s w e a k e s t
w e a p o n , a 4-5 defeat was not so bad
(especially as our best Epeeist couldn't
m a k e it for the e n d of the match!).
A g o o d performance all round, n o w
