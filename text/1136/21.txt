This self-titled exhibition sees M c Q u e e n
returning to the site of his 1995 debut. The
exhibition itself is not m u c h of a stretch
for M c Q u e e n w h o sticks t o w h a t h e
knows best; using novel c a m e r a angles
and projections to cast n e w light o n his
subjects.
N o w h e r e is this more clearly d e m o n -
strated than in "Drumroll", a triple screen
film of a barrel b e i n g rolled by M c Q u e e n
d o w n the streets of Manhattan. W e view
the journey out of both e n d s of the bar-
rel, from an eccentric position, a n d look-
ing radially from the surface of the barrel.
While the film does prove interesting in
highlighting the number of circular objects
that o n e e n c o u n t e r s w h e n travelling
d o w n a street, a n d serves as an excellent
illustration of the motion of a point o n the
circumference o f a rolling circle, w h i c h
y o u may have b e e n c o n t e m p l a t i n g since
your GCSE physics classes, o n c e the quasi-
novelty of the camera placement wares
off o n e is left with the feeling that noth-
ing n e w has really b e e n a c c o m p l i s h e d .
The s a m e is true o f the other film
installation, "Deadpan". M c Q u e e n recre-
ates the classic Buster Keaton s c e n e
w h e r e h e is spared from b e i n g crushed
under a falling wall by a conveniently
a silent four and a half minutes of slow accurate measurement?) there was not a
motion black and white. Only once do w e lot lo take h o m e after the initial novelty,
see M c Q u e e n flinch as the wall speeds But m a y b e that's exactly the- point
M c Q u e e n shows no e m o t i o n in spite of
events, no anticipation a n d no relief, and
the viewer therefore has nothing to relate
to o n an emotional level.
All in all, the exhibition isn't g o i n g to
radically alter the way y o u view the world,
but for a p o u n d it's worth a look. At least
at the e n d of your visit you'll feel that lit-
tle bit more urbane for just having entered
a gallery a n d your engineer friends will be
impressed with your level of sophistication
or not.
The exhibition is o p e n until 21 March
a n d associated events include several
gallery talks a n d a special o n e day con-
ference o n the m e a n i n g of political in the
context of contemporary art.

THE STRONGER and BLOOD WEDDING
THE SOUND OF SILENCE union concert Hall - Preview
G r a c e T f i e a t r e
Valentine's w e e k - a time for r o m a n c e
and love. H o w fitting that Grace Theatre
should c h o o s e to put o n a d o u b l e bill
about infidelity a n d betrayal. In 'The
Stronger' I w a s unfortunately distracted
from the t h e m e by M r s X's teetering fur
hat. It w a s hard t o i g n o r e b e c a u s e
although there were two other characters
on stage ('Miss V a n d the waiter) she had
all the lines - yes, this was a m o n o l o g u e .
It also occured t o m e h o w well I could
play the part o f Lmile in T h e s o u n d o f
silence'. It g o e s s o m e t h i n g like this:
Enter stage right w e a r i n g t u x e d o ,
drunk. Girlfriend rants a b o u t y o u n o t
phoning. Ignore her. G o t o b e d . Read
newspaper. S m o k e a cigarette. G o t o
sleep for Vi hour while girlfriend rants on.
And on. A n d o n . Get up. Put o n trousers.
Exit stage right to go out drinking.
This play w a s a m o n o l o g u e too. A
singer talks herself to despair in front of
her insensitive, sometimes sleeping lover.
Quite similar to 'The Stronger' w h e r e a
betrayed wife talks herself to despair in
front of her husband's mistress.
Both ladies in the Stronger w e r e
immaculately dressed in the style of the
turn of the century Christmas shopper -
all mink coats a n d fur hats - as befits this
period m e l o d r a m a . A c o m m a n d i n g per-
formance from Christina Greatrex drew
s o m e attention away from her misbe-
having head-piece w h i c h , despite her
best efforts, eventually slid away to reveal
a non-period hair style.
I like fringe v e n u e s b e c a u s e they
usually allow drinks in the auditorium, so
if the action b e c o m e s less than interest-
ing, o n e can always pick up one's G u i n -
ness and appreciate that instead. I f o u n d
myself d o i n g this several times. To trek all
the w a y t o C l a p h a m l o see this w a s
slightly disappointing. Although the pro-
g r a m m e b o a s t e d a b o u t t h e Shake-
spearean pedigree of the performers, I
thought s o m e t h i n g was slightly lacking.

Brett Donovan spoke to the ICSM cast of
Blood wedding after watching them in
rehearsal.
After m u c h deliberation, ICSM o p t e d for
the p r o d u c t i o n n a m e d B l o o d W e d d i n g .
After m a n y s u c c e s s f u l p r o d u c t i o n s
including Shakespeare, it w a s t h o u g h t
apt t o play this Spanish Tragedy. What
m a k e s Blood W e d d i n g stand out f r o m
Shakespeare is perhaps that is less neb-
ulous and somewhat shorter than Shake-
spearean affairs with only three acts.
A tragedy, l e d e r l c o Lorca's play mir-
rors a true story that took place at Alme-
ria in 1928 . Ihe title hints at the plot. This
is n o ordinary marriage - the bride is
caught b e t w e e n the m a n she w a n t e d to
marry (Leonardo), with w h o m she feels
exhilarated a n d exciting, a n d her bride-
g r o o m to be. a safe a n d d e p e n d a b l e
character. L e o n a r d o marries a n o t h e r
w o m a n as a result o f family f e u d i n g .
A d u l t e r o u s p a s s i o n f l o w s b e t w e e n
Leonardo a n d the bride to be, with the
result that the bride leaves abruptly at
the c e r e m o n y with Leonardo. Inciden-
tally, Leonardo is the only n a m e d char-
acter in the play.
Central to the play is Ihe n o t i o n o f
fate and heredity. In the emotional strug-
gle h o w will the passions a n d impulses
fair against the social conventions? H o w
will the struggle with b a d b l o o d end?
t h r o u g h o u t there is m u c h s y m b o l -
ism, both in terms of characters played
a n d s o m e o f the m o r e latent ideas, l o r
e x a m p l e t w o characters play the roles
m o o n a n d d e a t h .
B l o o d W e d d i n g is directed by Rosie
Beal-Preston, a 1 st year clinical medic. An
experienced actor, she is certainly accus-
t o m e d to treading the boards, a n d the
cast i n f o r m m c that she is an excellent
a n d a c c o m p l i s h e d director. S h e h a s
a i m e d t o b e as faithful t o the original
m e a n i n g as possible, unlike other inter-
pretations w h i c h l e n d to bias toward
the sexual aspects.
Being a p r e v i e w I w a s not allowed
t o k n o w t h e e n d i n g . B u t I h a v e a n
inkling of w h a t may be in store, proba-
bly involving a b l o o d y finale, but for
w h o m ? I n o w have to attend the w h o l e
p e r f o r m a n c e , if only for c o m p l e t e n e s s .
H o w e v e r w i t h t h e t i m e a n d effort
e x p e n d in addition to the skill of the cast
a n d directors, I d o u b t it will be anything
other than a success.
