'Dennis Patrickson - w h a t d o e s he w a n t
to do?' The creation o f a fifth sabbatical
post - D e p u t y President (Education &
Welfare) - will free up a lot of the Presi-
dent's time, leading to a re-defining of
what t h e President actually does. I w o u l d
look to have m o r e o f a figurehead/com-
municative role, with the emphasis firmly
on c o m m u n i c a t i o n .

higher proiil • rid or p e o p l e to b e bet-
ter e d u c a t e d about their purpose. S o m e
students d o n ' l have a clue w h o their
D e p R e p or A c a d e m i c Officer is a n d this
is t h e person that they could a n d s h o u l d
be c o m p l a i n i n g to w h e n , for example,
their course Is being taught inadequately.
I'd also like to s e e regular
reports/pages/columns in helix o n w h a t

up to. N o t just in Eclix, t h o u g h : o n an

300 words to say " m o r e o f Ihe g o o d , less
of the bad", still, if p e o p l e are willing to
read this, here's what I think our U n i o n ' s
priorities s h o u l d b e .
1. Students
Every report the U n i o n makes within
itself and to the rest o f the student b o d y
should start with w h a t is b e i n g d o n e for
us students, h o w w e will benefit.
2. Students
The objectives for all activities, meet-
ings, etc. s h o u l d b e ,
1. students
2. students
3. students
4. money, college's opinion....
(give or take legality a n d other minor
matters). Simple example, U n i o n people
s h o u l d c o n t i n u e h e l p i n g correct b u d -
gets. After all w h i c h students are helped
if a club doesn't get its m o n e y .
3. Students
The facilities a n d activities of t h e
U n i o n arc available l o all of us a n d that
n e e d s to be c o m m u n i c a t e d .
Nah, s " t , I a p p e a r to have m e n -
t i o n e d c o m m u n i c a t i o n , here w e
standard unreal promises yet, yc
year it barely gels belter. But for \

Principally, I w a n t t o create a U n i o n
w h e r e y o u have a large say in i h e
choices m a d e . I've b e e n talking to a lot
of students around Imperial' elli e a i d
a n u m b e r of issues have c o n n le |g il
issues that I will address il'elet led lo the
position o f President.
Research at IC f u n d e d a n d dn
by Shell a n d BAe is paid for with the prof-
its m a d e by selling arms a n d e q u i p m e n t
to oppressive regimes. The p e o p l e o f
t h e s e countries have n o say in w h a t
research is d o n e or h o w their o w n lives
are run.
I c o n d e m n t h e investment in c o m -
p a n i e s that c o l l u d e with o p p r e s s i v e
regimes. I will c a m p a i g n against t h e
|§§e o f IC a c a d e m i c a c h i e v e m e n t s to
d e u lop arms a n d f u n d dictators.
I have not met a n y o n e with g o o d
things to say about their service Irom the
!w. i s : io. I will devote as m u c h
;
' as necessary to improving the wait-
ing limes a n d level of care e x p e r i e n c e d .
I have b e e n involved heavily in t h e
c a m p a i g n against tuition fees a n d have
b e e n a m e m b e r o f ICU Socialist Worker
Student Society for t w o years. I believe
that the extra £1000 charge without pro-
vision for extra personal funding induces
real hardship for students a n d discour-
ages p e o p l e from applying to university.
I w a n t t h e g o v e r n m e n t to provide free
education for all so that all p e o p l e have
access to higher education, a n d will con-
tinue to c a m p a i g n for it.
I will e n d e a v o u r to represent your
views a n d w i s h e s if elected to t h e posi-
tion o f President. I w i s h to m a k e the
U n i o n as a p p r o a c h a b l e as possible and
to m a k e all of its actions accountable to
you. A b o v e all, I w a n t to e n c o u r a g e
political discussion a n d activity. I will
run t h e U n i o n efficiently, but want to
broaden its concerns beyond the b o u n d -
aries o f its day-to-day running.
