Natural Fawn Killers aka NFK (PC)
January has really b e e n a tad t o o q u i d for
this reviewer. Perhaps SimCity 3000 a n d
A l p h a Centuri will b e in the s h o p s by t h e
time that this review hits t h e lecture the-
atre, but apart from these small bright
lights t h e only creatures stalking t h e
g a m e s h o p s have b e e n compilations or
worse still, t h e B G a m e . Natural f a w n
Killers has B g a m e written all d o w n its
spine.
f o l l o w i n g t h e beaten trail that Deer,
Duck a n d Grizzly Hunter have stalked,
Natural Fawn Killers tries to inject a
slight a m o u n t of h u m o u r into the
otherwise d e a d pan hunting game.
Unfortunately in t h e same w a y the
National L a m p o o n team attempts to
parody A m e r i c a n film genres, NFK
has h a m m e d it u p too m u c h a n d
included t o o little meat. The hunter
g a m e s captured the interest o f the
British public in the same w a y a flat-
^ mate's genital warts capture one's
interest - they might well be out
there but y o u sure didn't want to expe-
rience the pain o f even s e e i n g t h e m .
To play t h e hunting g a m e s properly
required t h e player to d o very little for
most o f the time. Stalking a n d m a k i n g
animal noises apcars to pretty m u c h s u m
u p most o f it. NFK is m u c h m o r e inter-
estng for t h e first f e w minutes, but the
simplicity a n d limited nature of the g a m e
play s o o n bring your interest levels back
to catatonic. Forget having to stalk the
prey, this is m u c h m o r e like a D o o m sit-
uation - run things d o w n a n d shoot
at short range. There is a telescopic
lens o p t i o n o n t h e hunting rifle for
sniping at creatures, both big a n d
small, t h o u g h this is mostly a waste
of time. S h o o t i n g creatures f r o m
distance s h o u l d b e what this g a m e
is about. Unfortunately smaller crea-
tures s e e m to ignore y o u until y o u
get almost close e n o u g h to s t o m p
o n t h e m rather than scarper away.
As for attempting to take o n larger
creatures with the hunting rifle is Ihe
simplest w a y to get c h o m p e d or
s t o m p e d o n yourself.
As far as the graphics g o at least
they have 3 D a c c e l e r a t i o n card
options to p r o d u c e p o l y g o n graph-
ics, but incredibly uninteresting a n d
simplistic polygon g r o u n d a n d river
graphics. Fven the p o l y g o n animals
w e r e not as impressive as could b e
expected. The rabbits were very sim-
ple, t h o u g h at least they h a d m a n -
a g e d to draw a n d animate a fawn with
a little m o r e detail, t h o u g h it d o e s look
remarkably like Bambi in a p p e a r a n c e .
The s o u n d is o n t h e s a m e level; for
m o v e m e n t there is t h e choice or either
crunchy leaf, crunchy g r o u n d or sloshing
water sounds.
Despite loathing most of this g a m e
n a m e s l y t h e simplistic g a m c p l a y , t h e
g r a p h i c s a n d t h e s o u n d there w e r e
things w h i c h w e r e slighly better. The
h u m o u r , t h o u g h sick, carries the g a m e
for a f e w minutes. S h o o t i n g crea-
tures at close range produces aortic
spurts of blood, or if y o u get a g o o d
e n o u g h shot o n t h e smaller ani-
mals a n instant decapitation - n o w
I told y o u it w a s sick. There is also
the ability to waste a series o f small
furry and large scaly creatures using
not only a hunting rifle, but gattling
g u n s , g r e n a d e l a u n c h e r s - e v e n
rocket launchers. Rabbit problems.
Just drop a b o m b near t h e m .
The only other saving grace w a s the
c o m p l e t e lack o f a m a d e u p story. N o
pretention o f a quest or a task, just a sim-
ple s h o o t i n g g a m e . Unfortunately even
this c a n not really c o m p e n s a t e for what
is a very p o o r g a m e . What ever y o u d o
do not b u y this g a m e , a n d even the
walk to your local rental outlet might not
be worth it - especially if it's cold, far
away, or y o u have to actually have to pay
lor it.

Sid Meiers - Alpha Centuri
, 1 , \ ./
Sid Meier has generally h a d t h e M i d a s
touch in p r o d u c i n g strategy g a m e s . Civ-
ilization a n d Civ 2 w e r e responsible for
the loss of millions o f w o r k a n d h o m e
hours t h r o u g h o u t the w e s t e r n w o r l d .
Their friday afternoon projects Masters
of O r i o n a n d M O O 2 w e r e less perfect,
contained s o m e nice t o u c h e s in that
your offensive a n d defensive w e a p o n s
could b e m o d i f i e d , so a fleet o f fast,
lightly a r m e d ships c o u l d attempt to
take o n a heavily a r m e d death star -
t h o u g h usually w i t h o u t
anything like t h e success
enjoyed in the movies.
So Sid is about to give
birth to Civilization 3, or
because of his split with
M i c r o p r o s e , A l p h a Centuri
(Microprose kept the rights
to the Civ name). Set o n
t h e first c o l o n y o u t in
space - t h e peaceful e n d -
ing to Civ a n d Civ 2, w h e r e
y o u take c o m m a n d of o n e of m a n y fac-
tions o f t h e original c o l o n y ship a n d
attempt to lead t h e m to d o m i n a t i o n of
the planet - either by d i p l o m a c y , by
ecomonically out p r o d u c i n g your o p p o -
nents, or by o l d f a s h i o n e d g e n o c i d e .
Expect heavily r e v a m p e d graphics, Al
a n d the inclusion o f a c u s t o m w e a p o n
platform editor.
Best o f all, there is an internet server
based multiplayer option. N o w y o u can
a t t e m p t to plot your w a y to the t o p
against organic, intelligence. Time to test
plans of global domination o n the rest o f
the world.
Simcity 3000
With Civ, t h e other strategy g a m e that
pretty m u c h has b e e n burnt onto the
back o f t h e retina is t h e Simcity series.
The original Simcity w a s a g a m e (hat
almost a n y o n e could play, t h o u g h f e w
really mastered. The sequel Simcity 2000
was a step forward both in graphics a n d
involvement, but w a s m u c h easier to
master. Soon excitement w a s only found
in p l a y i n g g o d a n d raining disasters
d o w n o n N e w Coventry.
Simcity 3000 has extra complexity
a n d i m p r o v e d graphics. W e can h o p e
that t h e dificulty level is corrected.
