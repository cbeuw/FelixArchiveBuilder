Hideous Kinky • •
Starring : Kate Winslet, Said Taghmaoui, Bella Riza, Carrie Mullan
Director: Gillies MacKinnon
Kate trades In posh frocks for cute kids.
K
ate Winslet's first m o v i e after
Titanic o u g h t t o b e a massive
blockbuster, for w h i c h she'll pock-
et several million, right? W r o n g - it's a
low budget Brit Flick, w h i c h aims to a p e
the success o f Saharan set r o m a n c e s
like The English Patient. Hideous Kinky
contains elements o f a t h o u s a n d differ-
ent British movies, all tied together in a
seventies-set, retro-styled package.
Yet despite t h e obviously p r o m i s i n g
premise, it's painful t o w a t c h . N e v e r
before has a 96 minute m o v i e m a n a g e d
to feel so long - we're talking Dances With
Wolves levels o f n u m b i n g t e d i u m . The
cinematography is undeniably g o o d , but
whilst the first f e w p a n o r a m i c s w e e p s
across the M o r o c c a n wastelands produce
a sense o f a w e , t h e seventieth identical
shot simply serves to m a k e y o u aware o f
h o w static t h e movie actually is.
The real p r o b l e m , however, is t h e
simple lack o f plot. As t h e m o v i e o p e n s ,
Winslet is struggling to.make e n d s m e e t
in Marrakesh, having left her upper-class
English origins behind her w h e n her hus-
band deserted her. So, s h e scrapes a liv-
ing by selling dolls in t h e market, whilst
simultaneously attempting to bring u p her
t w o children, played by Riza a n d Mullan
-whose favourite words are (according to
the press notes) 'hideous' a n d 'kinky'.
However, despite an outward pretence of
happiness, n o n e o f t h e m are happy -
until help arrives in t h e form o f the mys-
terious Taghmaoul - playing a charismatic
local w o r k e r called Bilal ... a n d that's
about it. They travel back and forth across
Indistinguishable plots o f desert (until
y o u lose all interest in w h e r e they actu-
ally are), losing a n d finding each other in
an entirely predictable way, but, in a nut-
shell, that's t h e entire plot.
Indeed, s o uneventful is the movie
that t h e only question it raises is w h y
Winslet c h o s e to m a k e it at all. (True, s h e
met her h u s b a n d James Threapleton o n
set, but s h e w a s hardly t o k n o w that
w h e n s h e signed t h e contract). If It's an
attempt to avoid typecasting, then it's a
d a m n g o o d o n e - but it's also a pretty fast
route to b e i n g entirely forgotten by Hol-
lywood. Indeed, fans o f Winslet, queen-
of-costume-drama (Titanic, Hamlet, Jude,
Sense & Sensibility) will hardly recognise
the w e a t h e r e d , t a n n e d actress they see
o n screen.
Nonetheless, s h e (and indeed all o f
the other stars) still turn in decent, c o m -
petent performances. Yet n o n e of t h e m
do a n y t h i n g m o r e ; t h e basic p r o b l e m
with Hideous Kinky is that it contains
n o t h i n g that brings t h e screen t o light.
Having secured a star a n d a nice location,
the production crew s e e m to have shut-
up s h o p a n d decided that any more work
w o u l d b e superfluous. A n d sadly, t h e
box-office receipts will probably bear out
that decision, fl

Definitely, a b s o l u t e l y , p o s i t i v e l y n o t .
