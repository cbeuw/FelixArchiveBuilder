'Children' (Remixes)
1996 saw the release o f o n e of the
biggest club tunes p r o d u c e d - a n u m b e r
o n e not only o n the dancefloors, but in
the charts all over the w o r l d . 'Children'
rocketed to the top. a n d so did Robert
Miles. 1999 s e c the re-release o f this
classic tune with a make-over f r o m lilt.
There are two remixes in the f o r m o f the
Courtyard tdit a n d Courtyard M i x . The;
former lasts about 12 m i n u t e s a n d the
latter about 6 minutes, both turning the
original tune inlo a m o r e progressive
house track. The original p
is still there, but n o w thei
beats, synths. a n d breakdc
remixes s o u n d similar, so il
w e e bit repetitive, but It's
tune anyway. Bloody excell

The Light
'Expand the Room'
(HooJ C h o o n s )
A hard-hitting h o u s e t u n e
from the p e o p l e at Elooj
Choons. With plenty of bass
the track c o m e s with 4 m
which d o try to give it s o m e varic-
but only o n e really stands o u
the rest. Three of the mixes s o u n d
practically the same, a n d feature s o m e
strange-sounding vocals, t h o u g h the
Ronnie Pilgrem M i x takes the tune to a
more D&B d i m e n s i o n . II is a strange
s o u n d i n g track, with plenty of bass a n d
quite a g o o d beat, but with the mixes
s o u n d i n g the same?, a n d lasting an age,
this is a tune that will e n d up d o i n g
your h e a d in, but then it w a s always
g o i n g to be hard to follow' up to the
superb G r e e c e 2000's 'Three Drives'.
Best to listen to this o n e first.

'Funk O n Ah Roll'

Master returns with this latest single
k O n A h Roll'. A g o o d tune, featur-
Brown's legendary vocals, 'Funk O n
Roll' c o m e s with seven mixes allow-

'Best F r i e n d '
(Tuff Jams)
Fairly b o r i n g g a r a g e tune. The A-side
mixes aren't the best, and neither are the
B-sides really, but the luff Jams Classic
Garage Mix is passable (just!). These cer-
tainly aren't tracks that v o u will be h u m -
m i n g d o w n the street all day.
