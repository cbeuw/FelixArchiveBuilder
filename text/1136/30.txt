IC 11 - 2 Leicester
O u r first mistake w a s giving t h e whistle
to t h e only bloke o n t h e pitch with a
white stick this schoolboy error w a s p u n -
ished by a n early penalty flick b e i n g
awarded against us. The shear p o w e r
and accuracy o f the flick nearly defeated
the cat-like agility o f R e d Helmet, w h o
clawed it out o f the centre o f the goal by
standing still.

(4-2 after penalty flicks)
Yes, it's true. T h e glory days are here
again as the Disco Squad see off the sec-
onds a n d carry o n a l o n g t h e trail, w h i c h
only heros dare t o tread. W e are in t h e
semi-final o f t h e U L U cup. C o m e o n t h e

This victory was hard-won, w r e n c h e d
from t h e jaws o f defeat. T h e g a m e w a s

The Disco boys put t h e fear o f t h e Sun
Medallion into t h e s e c o n d s in t h e first
half, a p p y l i n g constant p r e s s u r e a n d
attacking verve. The half e n d e d score-

2nds fought back with r e n e w e d vigour.
The Disco Boys sturdy d e f e n c e held firm,

of t h e s e c o n d half w o u l d b e t h e most
important. Foolishly w e allowed t h e m to

was a disappointing result the opposition
probably deserved it.

SKIING
2 in 1
IC ski team went to participate in the 2nd
Huskis race series. For most t h e race
went well, the exception being the pres-
ident o f the t e a m . H e fell, bravely got
up, a n d c o n t i n u e d . Unfortuantely he
had lost a lot of time. Fate h a d it that
he finsihed just b e h i n d t h e president o f
UCL ski club (a w o m a n a n d not a brilliant
skier by a n y standards. It w a s later
a n n o u n c e d that s h e w a s satisfied with
her performance, but f o u n d h i m lacking
in many areas, including k e e p i n g erect.
Notable results from Oliver M a n n (3rd
snowboard) a n d Gareth Hail (15th all
categories).
The w e e k e n d of the 6/7th February
saw the ski club d o a total o f 30 hours
of bus to reach sunny, s n o w y A v i e m o r e
(North Scotland). To be honest, it w a s
cold, blizzard a n d icy but there w e r e
details (except that races w e r e c a n -
celled). Overall, a g o o d time w a s h a d .
Thankyou to all those w h o m a d e t h e
effort to c o m e so far to race for IC.

TENNIS
Mens: Having c o n q u e r e d L o n d o n with
impressive victories against U M D S (6-0),
KCL (5-1), Royal Holloway (4-2) a n d U C H
(6-0), IC M e n ' s Tennis T e a m w a s ready
for the challenge against Coventry in the
national stage o f BUSA. Things started
badly. Coventry n o . 1 (former British
under 18 n u m b e r 15) destroyed our cap-
tain Julien. W e w e r e 2-0 d o w n after
Mark's losing p e r f o r m a n c e . However,
our t w o m a g i c m e d i c s (Hani a n d Jon)
pulled t h e score back to 2-2 after t w o
gripping three setters. The s u n c a m e
d o w n a n d t h e lights c a m e on,- it w a s
time for t h e d o u b l e s . A n hour later,
Coventry h a d g o n e , IC w a s out.
Women's: IC played against Stafford-
shire University a n d easily w o n 4 - 2 .
The first match in league e n d e d posi-
tively a l t h o u g h at t h e b e g i n n i n g it w a s
not certain as to w h e t h e r all the players
w o u l d reach t h e destination, Stoke-on-
Trent thanks to t h e a m a z i n g efficiency
of Staffordshire University w h o had
given details o f t h e match o n the pre-
vious day.
3 out o f 4 singles e n d e d in favour
of Imperial a n d a d o u b l e h a d to be
given away because o n e of our players
had to leave early. Nonetheless, Maria
and Alessia thrashed the adversary cou-
ple with 6-1 6-2 in less than 1 hour.
Thanks to all t h o s e w h o played.
Randomness
Yes, it's m e again, your friendly sports e d .
You m a y be w o n d e r i n g w h y I a m talking
to y o u . Well, apparently very little sport
was played this w e e k . Or so it w o u l d
s e e m f r o m t h e number of match reports
that I have received.
These pages are set aside for t h e
sports teams to submit articles o n their
team's adventures. It w o u l d be g o o d to
receive m o r e regular reports, especially
^. f r o m the 1st teams. I a m t e m p t e d to
set up s o m e sort of incentive scheme, \
but I k n o w that will only e n d up with m e
buying drinks for t h e sports teams, a n d
my wallet is not that d e e p .
Anyway, I'm o f f to lie d o w n in a
dark r o o m for a c o u p l e o f w e e k s to
recover from t h e stress o f typing up a n d
laying out these pages, so next w e e k
these pages will b e in the capable hands
of s o m e o n e else. That reminds me,
if a n y o n e else out there is interested in
helping m e d o these pages, feel free to
contact me/the Felix office.
