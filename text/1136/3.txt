IC Applications Fall
Figures released by t h e Universities a n d
jColleges A d m i s s i o n s Service (UCAS)
s h o w that the proportion o f school-leav-
ing applicants for university places h a s
fallen. The only g r o u p for w h i c h there
was any increase at all - with a 0.4 %
increase in n u m b e r s that is m o r e than
a c c o u n t e d for b y the rise in actual p o p -
ulation - is t h e under-21's from t h e UK;
applicants from every single other group
have fallen in a b s o l u t e terms. The
biggest falls have b e e n in e n g i n e e r i n g
a n d the sciences - Civil, Electrical a n d
Electronic Engineering applications have
d r o p p e d over 11 % ; Physics applications
fell 10.3 % , a n d even 'sexy, trendy' Biol-
ogy has been hit, with applications falling
3.4 % . Ihe biggest drop - over 20 % - is
in C o m p u t e r Science a n d Software Engi-
neering, while Business a n d M a n a g e -
m e n t studies is still by far t h e m o s t
popular subject.
Imperial C o l l e g e , particularly, h a s
b e e n hit with a n overall d e c r e a s e in
applications o f 4 . 8 % - w i t h a 1 9 . 3 %
decrease in overseas applications, doubt-
less precipitated by t h e e c o n o m i c crisis
in the Far East.
Cash for Qualifications
Several IC students w e r e startled last
m o n t h to receive a s p a m m e s s a g e via
email essentially o f f e r i n g a d e g r e e ,
admittedly from a non-accredited uni-
versity, for payment. The daring mass
cash-for-qualifications offer appears to
have b e e n l i m e d carefully to coincide
with the lowest point in most students'
academic years.
Holbein Theft
Holbein Hall resident Neil Luck w a s sur-
prised to discover an intruder in his r o o m
on Friday 5 I ebruary. Returning from a
brief visit to the kitchen he f o u n d a m a n
in t h e process o f stealing his c o m p u t e r .
The m a n h a d entered t h r o u g h a g r o u n d
floor w i n d o w , w h i c h h a d b e e n left
slightly ajar. A l t h o u g h M r Luck
a t t e m p t e d to restrain t h e burglar, h e
escaped, d r o p p i n g t h e loose c h a n g e h e
had picked up, a n d ran away d o w n I ul-
h a m Road. Fortunately, n o t h i n g w a s
taken, although M r Luck w a s left bruised
by the encounter.
College security w a s quick to arrive
o n t h e s c e n e a n d t h e p o l i c e arrived
rather later. The m a n is described as
being in his early to m i d 20's, a n d of I lis-
panlc origin, t h e incident occurred at
7.30 p m ; a n y o n e in t h e Evelyn G a r d e n s
area at that time w h o s a w anything sus-
picious s h o u l d contact security.
Gulix Going to Court?
Oxbridge Don
A n Oxford a n d a Cambridge college that
share the s a m e n a m e have c o m e
together to create t h e very first g e n u i n e
a n d real "Oxbridge" d o n . This sees t h e
two Corpus Christi colleges burying tra
ditional rivalries in Ihe face of sliff c o m
petition at h o m e a n d a b r o a d a n d
c o m i n g together l o create a joint junior
research fellowship. David Stone, a C a m
bridge historian, will s p e n d two years at
e a c h college w h e n h e takes up the p o s
in October.
Explosive Discovery
Nitrogen m a y normally be regarded as
b e i n g o n e o f t h e m o r e dull a n d boring
o f Ihe chemical elements - the stable,
invisible gas that forms eighty per cent
of the air w e breathe - but the virulently
explosive n e w creation o f Dr Karl Christe,
a research scientist w o r k i n g for the U S
Air force, appears to c h a n g e their per-
ceptions s o m c w h a l . As reported in Ihe
Times, Dr Christe w a s the leader of a
t e a m o f IS chemists, w o r k i n g a l the
Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave
Desert, that m a n a g e d to synthesise a
n e w form o f e l e m e n t a l nitrogen. N s ,
effectively d i s p r o v i n g t h e commonly-
held notion that it w o u l d b e impossible
to bind m o r e than three atoms o r nitro-
g e n together into a molecule. A n Nr
m o l e c u l e has five atoms in a V-shape
a n d w o u l d normally not create m o r e
than a brief flutter, w e r e it not for its
instability that promises advances in the
fields of propulsion a n d explosives.
Last M o n d a y s a w a
n e w publication in
the lecture theatres
of Imperial College. 'Gulix', published by
City a n d Guilds Union, w a s an attempt to
improve the otherwise bland cover of
Guildsheet, by copying Ihe layout a n d
design of I elix's fronl page. I he stunt w a s
technically well orchestrated, although
whelher or n o l il confused senior m e m -
bers o f the college remains unconfirmed.
Unfortunately for C&GLJ, o n e small
detail w a s overlooked - the small print o n
the: bottom of I elix page two, in particu-
lar the ISSN regislration a n d copyright
information. While the layout a n d type-
faces used by Gulix ate sufficiently differ-
ent from I elix's to m a k e legal action
unlikely, the world famous cat logo and let-
terhead has b e e n r e p r o d u c e d almost

exaclly. I elix I dilor
M r Ld Sexton is
believed to be look-
ing into ihe legal situation, only c o m -
menting "I will consult with my lawyers
before making a n y formal statement".
M e a n w h i l e sources close to Dinesh,
Ihe editor of Guildsheet/Gulix, have
reported thai he is attempting to transfer
privale l u n d s l o offshore investments,
p e n d i n g Ihe outcome; ol any court action
W h e n questioned about Ihe matter, he
apparently exclaimed "It's all lies!", h u l
Ihis report was later revealed lo be entirely
untruc>.
II s e e m s that the only h o p e lor C&GU
is that the matter blows over without
reaching the courts. I his is indeed possi-
ble for, as o n e I clix reporter put il, "imi-
tation is the besl fe>rm of flattery".
