minutes, Highlander a n d G o n a d s m a d e
sure that GKT didn't k n o w what hit t h e m .
S o m e h o w t h e m e d i c s w o k e u p a n d got
past Baldrich a n d M i r a n d a a n d m a n -
aged to run into 'keeper Flo giving t h e m
a penalty. They put in another a n d IC sat
d o w n at half time to s o m e talk o n tac-
tics from captain Slave. Back to the pitch
and still 3-2 up, w e c o n c e d e d another,
and then another 6 minutes f r o m time...
w o u l d this nightmare never end? 2 m i n -

ger p l a y e d t h e ball t h r o u g h to
Highlander w h o aptly s w u n g it over the
GKT d e f e n c e to G o n a d s , w h o then vol-
lyed h o m e . Their ref t h e n d e c i d e d that
as w e were attacking it w o u l d b e a g o o d
time to b l o w the whistle.
Extra t i m e yielded n o t h i n g , a n d a
penatly shoot-out stood b e t w e e n us a n d
the next round o f BUSA. Slave s t e p p e d
up first a n d h a d a shot saved. Louise
was next a n d hit the back o f the net bril-
liantly. Baldrich hit h o m e as well a n d w e
w o n 3-1 after I lo saved 2 o f their shots.
Last 16 here w e come...!
It w a s cold, w i n d y a n d their pitch w a s
wider than it w a s long. I he magnificent

channel tunnel rail link... so w h y d o Col-
lege w a n t this farming college exactly?)
a n d faced an o p p o s i t i o n squad of 12.
W e w o n d e r e d if w e c o u l d d o it. W e
thought w e could. A n d w e did. G o i n g a
goal d o w n kicked us w h e r e it hurt a n d
IC faced the ball as no other team could.
Highlander scored 4 a n d Louise stuck
o n e in for g o o d measure.... W y e lost it
a n d resorted to hacking the IC captain

Can w e possibly lose in our n e w kit...?

BASKETBALL
Three in a row for ICU Basketball
For t h e third year in a row, ICUs Basket-
ball team qualified for the last 16 ofBUSA.
G r e e n w i c h , ranked s e c o n d in t h e BUSA
South West Division, w a s far f r o m a
match for the IC men's basketball t e a m .
For the first knock-out of the BUSA C h a m -
pionship, IC, without p e r f o r m i n g well,
only had problems for about 20'. Even
t h o u g h a h o m e match, the tie had to b e
played at the U n i o n g y m of Q u e e n Mary
as there w a s n o court available to IC for
a W e d n e s d a y fixture. The match started
with IC taking a small lead of 4-8 points.
However, the b a d r e b o u n d record o f
the forwards and the low percentages of
the guards allowed G r e e n w i c h to finish
the half a h e a d (32-29). As s o o n as t h e
s e c o n d half started IC tightened their
d e f e n c e , e v e n t h o u g h t h e o f f e n c e
remained problematic. The result w a s
that a difference of a b o u t t e n points
was secured a n d this w a s to remain until
the e n d , despite the last-minute efforts
by the Greenwich guards. In the average-
to-bad general p e r f o r m a n c e of IC, Sasa
Bjelogrlic, A d a m Winton and the Captain,
T h e o d o r e M o u r o u t i s offered, in c o m -
parison, the m o r e reliable solutions.
A lot o f things n e e d to b e i m p r o v e d if IC
are to w i n their s e c o n d knock-out away
to O x f o r d Brookes. T h e inclusion of Ste-
fano Bondi, a n e w 2.05m center, in the
squad, as well as t h e return of Elias 1
1 lad Is
after a two-week a b s e n c e d u e to illness
promise significant strengthening o f the
t e a m near the basket. If at least s o m e of
the g u a r d s c a n have a g o o d day in
Oxford o n Wednesday, IC have a g o o d
c h a n c e to b e in the BUSA finals for the
first time ever. It will b e the prefect a n d
well-deserved reward for the team m e m -
bers a n d t h e effort they put throughout
the year.
C ERRATUM >
It has b e e n brought to my attention that
last w e e k s IC III v ICSM III hockey match
did not take place, a n d as such, the
