album: cocteau twins -
milk and kissesaa dick
I'm sure that if we all learnt to speak 'Elizabeth
Fraser', then the world would be an altogether
more beautiful place. How can you fail to be
enchanted by this, the umpteenth Cocteau Twins
album, with all its ethereal charm? It doesn't mat-
ter that the words are a hotchpotch; a dictionary
that has had alternate pages torn away to reveal a
whole new vocabulary. Rather this than some for-
lorn attempt at a failed rhyming couplet (I have
still to understand quite what a vVonderwalT is,
apart from a crass attempt to avoid using the word
'wonderful').
Anyway, enough ofthe vitriol. As I said, there
is no room for it here. This album comes as some
surprise, following much internal squabbling
between Liz and one-time partner, Robin Guthrie
- the man, along with the ffequendy under-rated
Simon Raymonde, responsible for the intricacies
adorning this particular cathedral. What did we
expect - something as venomous as The
Exploited perhaps? Maybe, for the cynics. But it's
no use trying to preach to the unconverted - you
either love the stuff or you find it as vile as Bonnie
Langford in Just William. To me, this album
shows the Cocteau's continuing maturity, adding
more and more delicate lyrics without ever
detracting from the fine song-smithery that the
trio obviously possess in abundance.
"So then, much more of the same," you say.
Well, yes, to be perfecdy honest but would we
really have it any other way? I, for one, will be tak-
ing Elizabeth Fraser to bed with me again tonight
and tomorrow night.
Whispering sweet nothings? For me, more
like speaking in tongues. (9)

bob mould™
The tfiird solo album from the ex-frontman of
Hiisker Dii and his first release since the demise
of Sugar reveals that his loathing of the music
industry has reached an all time peak. "This one is
for me," is the sole acknowledgement and indeed,
there will be no tour, no singles and no interviews
to promote this record.
Bob Mould has carved a career out of making
great up-beat guitar pop, while at the same time
writing some ofthe most introverted and self-crit-
ical lyrics. His talent is again evident here with
tracks such as 'Deep Karma Canyon' and
'Egoveride' which have instant appeal and easily
stand out above the rest.
The problems start when the tempo slows
and the guitar effects are removed, leaving only an
acoustic guitar with his, quite frankly, none-too-
special vocals. A prime example of this is 'Hair
Stew', which is by far the worst track, and ends
with a particularly painful piece of feedback over
some badly sung, soul-destroying lyrics.
My main gripe is not the music, however,
which is on the whole very good, but the cynicism
which you find rising within you as each track
passes. We all like to wallow in self-pity now and
again, and some would say that it is very good for
the psyche, but not all of us have a multi-million
dollar music industry backing us up in order to
allow us the outlet for this emotion. Making
money from this makes me feel that Mould is
lying. If this album is indeed just for him, why
even release it? I'm sure that his record company
don't indulge their artists for love; the fact of the
matter is that fans will buy it and that the record
company have saved a lot of time and money
through lack of promotion.
From the self-assessment chart on the insert
to the lyrics, the whole affair stinks of self-indul-
gence rather than self-criticism. For being up his
own rear end, Bob Mould gets a (0). For the musi-
cal content I have to give him a (7).
