Linstead footballers win tournament
BY MARTIN ARCHIBOLD
A t the end of last term the eleven
most elite hall teams met head to
head in the most prestigious
event in the inter-hall football
calendar. T h e C o m p e t i t i o n
played at Harlington was the first
of its kind.
Opening rounds saw surpris-
ingly early exits for Falmouth
Keogh and G a r d e n halls. In the
semi-finals unlucky Tizard suf-
fered at the hands o l 'boring bor-
ing' C l a y p o n d s (1-0), whilst
Southwell were overwhelmed by
the relentless attacking style
characteristic of Linstead H a l l .
T h e final predictably saw
some determined play from both
sides, Linstead defence held
C l a y p o n d s u n c o m p r o m i s i n g l y ,
with some unrelentingly savage
tackling, notably by David
Chattenee and Ming Chan.
The Clayponds eleven-man
defence held solid in the first half
despite some sparkling work
down the centre by Linstead's
resident superstar Amo.
In the second, period there
was more of the same, our under-
strength attacking talent sprightly
brushing aside the Clayponds
old-timers.
With ten minutes left on the
clock, a Linstead forward eventu-
ally penetrated the Clayponds
rearguard, a dashing run by Amo
followed by a lovely controlled
pass left Shane with a clear sight
of goal. Unsurprisingly his superb
right shin shot found the net.
Clayponds finally decided to
play some football. Alas, despite
some ludicrous penalty claims,
they never really troubled the
better, and basically harder side.
The game ended one-nil to
us, the terraces went crazy with
both pleasure and pain, and the
entire population of Linstead
went to Southside bar to brag
about it.
Special thanks to all the
team captains and Nic Roland in
particular for a very well organ-
ised competion.
