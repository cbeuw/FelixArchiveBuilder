Dear Felix,
I was very disappointed with
your editing of my chess report.
Why is it that everybody else
gets twice as much space as us? I
was not impressed with the way
you chopped the report in half,
explaining all the details of how
the competition worked, but
then not even giving our results.
What is the point of explaining
all the rules of the competition
and then only writing one line to
say how we did? If there wasn't
any room or something, we'd
much rather have had a decent
report in the next Felix. Also I
was hoping you might mention
when we meet, which you didn't
put in the article or the diary.
Anyone who reads the article
and wants to come to the club
won't know where we meet. It
would be nice if you could
include us in your diary in future.
We meet on Wednesdays in the
Brown Committee Room or
Clubs Committee Room at
6.30pm.
Dom Goodwin
On behalf of Felix, I'm sorry
you feel that you were treated
unfairly, but there are also a few
points to clear up.
It's generally understoood
that reports may be edited for
length; as it was printed, your
write-up said who was on the
team, what the competition was
and how well you did, which I'd
regard as the relevant points.
The sports section size
depends on the number of
reports submitted, so it would
be unfair on the other sports
teams for us to set aside space
for 'old news' if we haven't been
asked to do so.
The same applies to diary
entries - you have to make your
wishes known. Now that you
have, you've been given a regu-
lar diary entry from now until
the end of term.
j Deadline for letters
in Felix 1057: midday,
Tuesday I 4th May j
i Please bring your union card
for identification. j

It's taken me four years, but I've
finally sorted it out. I've worked
out what's wrong.
It's not that Imperial's stu-
dents are boring and ignorant -
witness Bradshaw, Totty et al.
and their rather alarming knowl-
edge of Greek mythology and
stained glass windows.
It's not that the College is
run by uncaring, anti-student
proponents of officialdom - over
the past few months I have grad-
ually come to the conclusion
that those who pull the strings
here are actually exceptionally
enthusiastic and motivated.
That's just the point, you see: I
think that as they plan and spend
their way into a bigger and
brighter and shinier Imperial
College of Science, Technology
and Medicine, those they
employ sink into deeper and
deeper pits of dissatisfaction.
I think I C must have a
monopoly on poorly - motivated,
sullen and intimidating staff.
People whose very presence
oozes a feeling that they are thor-
oughly pissed off and don't want
to be here. Catering staff that
throw your change at you as if to
suggest that you really don't
deserve to be allowed to pay
through the nose for a bland
chicken tikka sandwich. Finance
department staff who throw
your grant cheque at you as
though the deed is the work of
the last of the great martyrs
rather than part of their job
description. Lecturers whose job
dissatisfaction and frustration is
manifested into a disdain and
dislike of students that makes
going to ask for last week's lec-
ture notes akin to a Labour of
Hercules. Security staff who,
when tentatively roused from
sleeping on the job because you,
unreasonably enough, require
some security assistance, display
the care and compassion of
Victor Meldrew.
I don't if they're not paid
enough, not challenged enough,
or it we simply have a personnel
department that has rather a lot
to learn. And before I get a post-
bag full of indignance, I wouldn't
begin to suggest that there aren't
plenty of absolutely delightful
security staff, nor that the
finance department doesn't have
it's fair share of charm. But so
long as the public face of this col-
leg is permeated with a liberal
dose of bored insolence we are
never going to get away from the
fact that being at Imperial is a lit-
tle bit embarrassing, and consid-
erably depressing.
