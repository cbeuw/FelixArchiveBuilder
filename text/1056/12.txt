bust-a-gut
Don't say we don't care for your
mental health - in this most
stressful of terms, we've decided
that the best solution is for you
all to have a good laugh, so we've
got two great comedy nights for
this term.
The first is tonight and is
sponsored, aptly enough, by
those purveyors of exam term
relief, ProPlus. To take your
mind off work for a while, we've
got three acts and special give-
aways. The acts are Miles
Crawford, Simon Fox, & Man
with the Beard, who between
them have done everything from
the National Lottery Live to the
James Whale Show, via comper-
ing the Annual Hells Angel
Convention (so heckle at your
peril). In addition to all this T V
work, all three are regulars on
the national circuits and play to
packed houses all over the coun-
try.
All this comedy talent is
yours tonight for just £2 or £1
with entscards, and doors open
at 8pm.
The second show is the
regional semi-final of the Daily
Telegraph Open Mic competi-
tion, which is going to be a smor-
gasbord of comic talent, with
fourteen acts getting five min-
utes each to win the chance of
going to the Edinburgh Festival,
and on to stardom, wealth, &
tons of top drugs.
The evening will be com-
pered by the show-stopping,
stage grabbing bag of talent that
is Boothby Graffoe. Plus there's
a smart offer that means that
everyone who comes with a
copy of the Daily Telegraph gets
a free bottle of Newcastle
Brown.
Doors open at 8.30, tickets
are £2.50 or £2, & you get free
entry to "Shaft" afterwards.
