Many students will already
be looking for accommoda-
tion for the next academic
year. Every year, many find
themselves experiencing
housing related problems.
Often, there is little that can
be done to avoid this but
sometimes better prepara-
tion and information can
help to avoid or at least to
deal with some situations
more effectively.
Important First
Questions
When you find a potential
property, by asking yourself
some obvious yet crucial
questions you can save your-
self a lot of trouble later on.
Such as;
1. Can I afford the rent?
2. Do I want to live in this
area? Will I feel secure trav-
elling to and from it at night?
3. How much are my travel
costs going to be?
4. If sharing with others- am
I confident that I will get
along with my co-tenants-
and are they sure that they
will not want to move out
early?
5. Who is responsible for
paying the bills and council
tax? (If all tenants are stu-
dents then you should apply
for exemption from Council
Tax from your local authori-
ty).
6. What do I know about the
landlord? Can I speak to
some previous tenants to see
if there have been any prob-
lems?
7. Will I be a tenant or a
licensee? (A licensee has
fewer legal rights than a ten-
ant and can sometimes be
evicted without a court
order).
Licensee or Tenant ?
You may be a licensee if, for
example;
a). You will be living in the
same property as your land-
lord and sharing some
accommodation (such as a
bathroom or kitchen)
b). You are living in a shared
house but....
c) Each resident has a
separate tenancy agreement.
d) The landlord is responsi-
ble for replacing tenants
who leave.
e) The landlord reserves the
right swap people around
into different rooms (in other
words you have not been
granted "exclusive posses-
sion" of any room)
It can be quite complicated
to ascertain your housing
status in the event of a dis-
pute (for example, if your
landlord is trying to get you
to leave.)
Even if you are a licensee, it
does not necessarily mean
that you will face difficul-
ties. However, it will make
it all the more important that
you consider point 6 above.
Another word of warning,
do not rely on "testimonials"
or written statements which
purport to be written by ex-
tenants. Try to contact ex-
tenants directly if you can.
If they still live there, do this
when the landlord is not
around to ensure that you are
getting an honest evaluation.
Contracts
and before you sign the con-
tract
8. Have I read the it through
thoroughly?
If there is anything you are
unsure about, you should get
it checked. Remember that
you are signing a legally
binding document. If there
is something in it which you
do not like or which seems
unreasonable, you should try
to change it now. If there is
a written clause which caus-
es you some concern and
the landlord assures you it
will not be applied, the only
way to be sure of this is to
change it before you sign.
Verbal contracts can be diffi-
cult to enforce.
9. Am I signing a fixed term
tenancy (i.e. a contract for a
specified length of time)? If
so, am I allowed, by virtue
of an express "break clause"
to move out before the fixed
term by giving a certain
length of notice or am I
legally liable for the entire
period? Usually, there will
not be a break clause and
you will be bound by the
agreement for the fixed
term.
10. Is there an inventory of
furnishings and fittings?
(This is important as your
landlord might wrongly
claim that you have dam-
aged or lost items when you
have not and this could lead
to deductions from your
deposit when you move out).
11. Am I happy with the
condition of the property? It
is sometimes much better to
get faults and damage reme-
died before you move in.
12. Do I have to pay a
deposit? Will I be given a
clear receipt for this and a
written assurance that it is
returnable (less deductions
for breakage's, damages,
cleaning or whatever)?
Joint Tenancies
Also, a few points to note on
Joint tenancies
1. Joint tenants are equally
liable for all the rent on a
property. Therefore if one
tenant refuses to pay his/her
rent, the others would have
to make it up or risk facing
an action for possession by
the landlord.
2. The easiest thing to do if
one joint tenant moves out
during the fixed term is to
seek the landlords permis-
sion to replace him/her. If
the tenancy is an assured
shorthold, then the original
tenancy is still in force
unless the landlord agrees to
issue a new agreement to
include the new tenant.
Unless this is done, the new
tenant is effectively a sub-
tenant of those named on the
agreement and technically,
the person who moved out
could still be pursued for any
rent owed.
Most students experience
few problems while living in
private accommodation but
some do get into difficulties.
As ever, careful thought and
preparation before entering
