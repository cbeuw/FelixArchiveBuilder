Bill Goodwin: Felix Editor 1988-89, ground-breaking lobbyist for
the freedom of the Press 1989-96.
BY T H E N E W S T E A M
Bill Goodwin, an IC graduate and
former Felix editor, has won a
year-long case against the British
Government, which he claimed
was violating his human rights.
The dispute began after Bill,
who was working for the trade
paper The Engineer, received
confidential information about a
computer company, Tetra Ltd.
An informant, who wished to
remain anonymous, described the
company's financial problems.
After attempting to contact one
of the company's senior exec-
utives regarding the matter, Tetra
claimed that the information had
been stolen from its offices, and
that its release could threaten the
company's survival. In November
1989 Tetra put pressure on Bill
to reveal the identity of his
source, winning a High Court
battle. He refused to comply and
was fined £5,000 for contempt of
court. His case was also
dismissed by the Court of Appeal
and the House of Lords. A t the
time he told Felix that he only
evaded a jail sentence "because of
the publicity".
In June 1994 The European
Commission for Human Rights
referred the case to the European
Court claiming that the British
Government had violated the
journalist's rights {Felix 1001).
They said that "protection of the
sources from which journalists
derive information is an essential
means of enabling the press to
perform its important function of
'public watchdog' in a democratic
society." They were unconvinced
that the publicity had caused
Tetra undue harm and that there
was any justification in
compelling Bill to reveal his
source, given that the matter did
not affect national security.
Backed by the National
Union of Journalists, what was
seen as a test case appeared
before the European Court of
Human Rights in April 1995
{Felix 1026), with Bill's lawyers
arguing that English Law violated
the European Human Rights
Convention by threatening jour-
nalists with fines and imprison-
ment if they wished to maintain
the anonymity of their sources.
At the end of March judge-
ment was given, ruling that Bill
was not entitled to compensa-
tion, though the court agreed his
rights had been violated. They
further ruled that the British
Government should pay his costs
of nearly £37,600.
Geoffrey Robertson Q C ,
who had been representing Bill,
said that this was a "landmark
judgement for press freedom,"
adding that the U K ' s 1981
Contempt of Court Act would
have to be amended. He also felt
that this would pave the way for
journalists to claim compensation
against the Government for
"mental anguish suffered by
being threatened with imprison-
ment for obeying their
consciences." Bill commented
that the outcome "was great
news for me and for journalists in
general."
Government gives IC the Natural Resources Institute
BY A N D R E W SMITH
In the latest attempt to privatise
ancillary Government activities,
Baroness Chalker has announced
that Imperial College is to be part
owner of a former Foreign Office
institute. Together with three
other British Universities,
Imperial will oversee the alloca-
tion of the Natural Resources
Institute's £25 million research
budget.
Speaking to Felix, Professor
John Archer, Imperial College's
Deputy Rector and newly
appointed Vice Chancellor of
Herriot Watt University,
welcomed the college's success-
ful bid saying that he was
"delighted it has turned out so
well for us." Imperial College will
be responsible for the allocation
of the research money, appoint-
ing two directors to a new
company, but will otherwise have
no financial outlay.
The Natural Resources
Institute (NRI) is currently
administered by the Overseas
Development Authority (ODA),
itself part of the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office. The
Government scheme, in imple-
menting a proposal by the
Universities of Greenwich and
Edinburgh, and Imperial and
Wye Colleges, sees the current
establishment being separated
into two distinct sections.
The first section will control
the NRI's 360 staff and premises
at Chatham Maritime in Kent,
and will become a department of
the University of Greenwich.
The second section, which will be
hived off from the NRI, is the
company in whom Imperial
College will own a 25% stake and
which will control the £25
million research budget.
NR International, this new
company, is due to come into
operation within three months.
With the first part of the
programme, transferring control
of the NRI from the O D A to
Greenwich University occurring
last week, N R International is
due to begin trading on 1 August
1996.
The Natural Resources
Institute is the vehicle through
which the government provides
scientific and technical expertise
in renewable and natural
resources for the overseas aid
programme. The Overseas
Development Authority is com-
mitted to provide funding at
current levels for the next five
years with the expectation that
better value for money can be
gained by this latest privatisation.
Under the programme
accepted by the Government,
NR International will put
research programmes out to
tender, accepting those which
provide the best value for money.
It is expected that Imperial itself
will naturally submit bids for
many of the proposals. The
complementary nature of the
four shareholders was empha-
sised by Prof Archer as he
suggested that with Edinburgh's
expertise in veterinary matters,
Wye's concentration on agricul-
tural research, and Imperial's
well known ecological excellence,
"nobody will be stepping on each
other's toes."
