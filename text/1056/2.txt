Campus-wide theft spree
BY ALEX FEAKES
The May Bank Holiday weekend
proved to be a hit of break to
some enterprising young thief as
Linstead Hall residents woke on
Monday morning to discover that
several of their games machines
and a telephone had been looted.
There were no signs of a forced
entry to the building and the
burglary has highlighted concerns
about security in Halls.
The thefts, reported on
Monday, are believed to have
occurred in the early morning,
shortly after a routine security
patrol had toured the building.
The thief removed glass from a
pinball machine and broke open
the cash box on a pool table in
the bar as well as wrenching a
payphone oil the wall in the
Lower Gallery, but it is not
known how much money was
stolen from the equipment.
Kenneth Weir, Deputy Head of
Security, noted that the amount
of violence used was unusual, and
probably indicated that the thief
was "inexperienced."
How the thief entered the
hall is not known, and though the
security around the bar area has
been recently stepped up it does
not seemed to have prevented
the games machines from being
looted, something that has
happened before.
Dr Lancaster, Warden of
Linstead Hall, admitted that
Security have "a major task
securing Princes Gardens", and
that access to Linstead was rela-
tively easy, though the Hall and
Security were looking to prevent
unauthorised access more effec-
tively in the future, including a
new set of locks for the doors and
windows of the bar.
Until a few years ago,
Linstead Hall had its own secu-
rity guard, but with the introduc-
tion of closed circuit television
monitoring, the guard was relo-
cated to Southside. Dr Lancaster
suggested that though a return to
this situation might have an
effect on the number of burglar-
ies, the move would not be cost
effective, as there have been too
few burglaries to justify the two
staff that would be needed to
cover the Hall.
Mr Weir said that the
resources that were available
were insufficient for more
guards, and that electronic moni-
toring from the Security station
at Southside was preferable.

The Royal School of Mines was
particularly badly hit by
computer thefts over the Easter
period. Thieves managed to
steal a significant cache of
components from the depart-
ments of physics, geology and
earth resources engineering and
an administrative section of the
Huxley building. By selectively
removing the components and
replacing the outer shells they
deferred detection until just
before the start of term.
The thieves probably
gained access to the building by
following students who legiti-
mately swiped in. There were
no signs of any break-ins, and
the first many knew of the
problem was when terminals
came up with memory error
messages.
Ken Weir, Deputy Chief of
Security, has advised the vari-
ous departments to effect
specific counter measures,
"Security could not have known
and this is a serious breach". H e
also suggested that if students
and staff see someone not
familiar to their department
behaving suspiciously they
should ask security to check
that they are there with good

Blythe spirit
Imperial College Governors are
meeting today to decide
whether to give the go ahead to
develop a new arts centre on the
top floor of the planned new
library and bookstore complex.
The plans include a new
auditorium and gallery as well as
rehearsal rooms improved facili-
ties for Imperial's choir and
orchestras. The project has been
made possible by the Blythe
bequest, which was designed to
promote music at Imperial, but
it is unclear whether the fund
has sufficient capital to go ahead
with the plans in the near future.
The Blythe project group are
developing an application for
National Lottery arts funding,
which may include cooperation
with the Albert Hall and local
museums.
Grand entrance
Senior IC staff and
Departmental Heads are report-
ing back to the estates depart-
ment over plans to redesign the
front entrance of the College.
Potential plans include
enclosing the Exhibition Road
end of the walkway beside
Mechanical Engineering with a
glass frontage and revolving
door. There have also been
suggestions that the develop-
ment may include a drop-in
centre for Imperial alumni.
Sue recovered
Sue Thornett, who works at
Princes Gardens Day Nursery, is
back at work after being struck
by a car while on the zebra cross-
ing in front of the Science
Museum about two weeks ago.
After X-rays and several days off
she is now well, and just needs a
follow up consultation. "It
wasn't that bad... no broken
bones or anything" said Sue,
thanking the well wishers.
