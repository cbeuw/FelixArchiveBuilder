Agent Trout, having rejected the idea of infiltrating the college by pretending to be a
student in Aeronatics, returns to base to consider his next move. Reports follows:

"Hangover, n. a severe headache or
other unpleasant after effects from
drinking much alcohol." OXFORD ENGLISH
DICTIONARY ( G R I F F I N SAVERS EDITION)
Yes, that about covers it. Ten days,
two hundred units of alcohol, thirty
four hours of sleep and a five hour
car journey after my last epistle, I
have returned to my quaint and
charming home town of
Sunderland.
Despite the aforementioned
unpleasant after-effects, I still man-
aged to have a hugely enjoyable
weekend, much at the expense of
Newcastle United Football Club. The
unbridled joy as Middlesborough
went one-nil down. The childlike
glee of seeing Keegan's face. The
rare beauty of miserable, dejected
Geordies. Poetry.
One thing I now have in common
with many of my neighbours is
unemployment. It was a sense of acute
surrealism with which I entered the
expansive Sunderland DSS office, a sadis-
tic amalgam of a cattle market, the stock
exchange and a lower division game of
rugby. It alarms me that, should I be
unable to find employment, I shall be
bound to attend on a weekly basis. I
would prefer, to be brutally honest, to
perform indecent acts with an orangutan
of dubious personal hygiene. But that's
just me.
Enough of my private life; I am both
amazed and saddened that style is not
appreciated in the North-East. Those who
hold the likes of Jarvis Cocker and Mark
Home as gurus above the blue-jeans-and-
checked-shirt brothers Gallagher are so
few in my home town that I have been
threatened in no uncertain terms that,
should I ever wear my daffodil yellow
acrylic shirt (with pointed 70's style col-
lars) again, it and I will be set aflame.
It's good to be back.
Cheers, J.T.
