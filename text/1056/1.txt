White next U L U President
BY RACHEL WALTERS
Sarah White, the President of
Imperial College Union, comm-
fortably won Wednesday's poll to
elect next year's University of
London Union President. The
ballot, held at the General Union
Conference, which is made up of
representatives from all Uni-
versity of London colleges, gave
Sarah 35 of the 66 valid votes
cast. Her opponent, Paul
Crawford from the Royal
Veterinary College, received 23
votes.
Although Sarah's first
response was "it was a bit close!"
she attributed most of M r
Crawford's votes to U L U ' s
medical students' group repre-
sentatives. U L U elections in
recent years have tended to high-
light the rift between London's
smaller medical schools and the
larger colleges such as Imperial
and U C L .
The two vice-presidential
positions were won by L S E
students; Claire Lawrie will be
the sabbatical responsible for
Finance and Services while Paul
Bates will take over the Welfare
and Representation remit.
The widely predicted results
have led to suggestions that the

voting was unfair, or even fixed.
Ed Ford, president of Queen
Mary and Westfield College
commented: "Well, we know it's
rigged, it's just a question of
proof, isn't it?" Sitting facing the
delegates at the front of the
conference, the current
University of London Union
President, Ghassan Karrian,
could be clearly seen nodding and
shaking his head accordingly as
candidates delivered their
hustings' speeches. Kate
Goldfarb, ULU's Welfare and
Communication sabbatical, said
the elections delivered "the
result we had all expected."
Health centre
delayed
BY THE NEWS TEAM
Building work on the new health
centre in Southside has been
suspended because the construc-
tion was causing to much disrup-
tion to students studying for
exams. The fitting-out stage of
the project will not resume until
the summer because IC estates
department received so many
complaints.
The heavy drilling work
which was particularly causing
disturbance was due to finish by
the end of the Easter holidays,
but Ian Caldwell, IC Director of
Estates said that "the building
work was more difficult than
expected." There had been some
delay when health and safety
measures had to be implimented
to deal with asbestos that the
construction has uncovered.
Students in the two South-
side staircases that were most
badly affected were offered use
of study bedrooms in Weeks hall
over the Easter period.
The new N H S centre was
due to be up and running in time
for the start of the next acade-
mic year, but it is not known
when it will now be able to
open.
