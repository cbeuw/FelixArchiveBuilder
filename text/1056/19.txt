ACCOMMODATION
AGENCIES
AND ILLEGAL FEES
into an agreement is your
best chance of avoiding pos-
sible pitfalls. Get a copy of
the Union produced
'Housing Rights Guide'
from either the Union
Reception or the College
Accommodation office.
If you are ever in a situation
where you think that your
landlord might be behaving
illegally (in terms of finan-
cial demands, harassment,
refusing to carry out repairs
etc.), then you should seek
assistance as soon as possi-
ble and never pay out extra
fees to landlords without
checking your legal situation
first (and this applies even if
you are breaking a fixed
term agreement). Also, the
earlier you begin to look for
accommodation, the less
likely you may be to accept
something sub-standard.
You will be paying out a
considerable amount of
money, it is up to you to try
to ensure you get reasonable
value for it.
Problems
Finally, if you have prob-
lems with accommodation
obtained through the
College Accommodation
Office, please put a com-
plaint to them in writing.
Bad landlords will be
refused access to the free
advertisement facilities but
the accommodation office
cannot act to prevent future
problems unless it receives
your help.
Positive feedback to the
accommodation office will
also be welcomed.
My thanks to the student
who called to inform me of
some accommodation agen-
cies in central London who
were demanding a "registra-
tion fee" from prospective
tenants (many of whom he
believed to be students).
Under the Accommodation
Agencies Act 1953, it is ille-
gal for an agency to ask for
money for registering a
client for simply receiving a
list of properties and it is
also illegal to ask for a
deposit which the agency
claims will be refunded if
they do not find the client a
property.
Accommodation agencies
can charge a fee for actually
finding a property and may
ask a client to sign an agree-
ment promising to pay this

when the agency has found
suitable accommodation and
she/he has agreed to move
into it. It is legal as long as
the client is not charged
before agreeing to take it.
An agency can also charge a
"holding deposit" if a client
has agreed to take a property
but has not yet signed a con-
tract to take up the property.
If someone has paid such an
illegal charge they could fol-
low two courses of action.
1. Report the matter to
Trading Standards who will
investigate and could prose-
cute if they find evidence of
such criminal.
2. If you have actually paid
such a fee, you could sue the
agency in the small claims
court.
Obviously, a tenant would
have to bear in mind that if
they were now in accommo-
dation provided by the
agency who charged the ille-
gal fee, then court action
could result in their agree-
ment being terminated either
at the end of a fixed term or
possibly sooner depending
on the nature of the contract.
If you think you have been
asked to pay an illegal fee,
check before you part with
any money. Any agency
which knowingly operates in
this manner may not be very
dependable and you may be
much safer to take your cus-
tom elsewhere.
