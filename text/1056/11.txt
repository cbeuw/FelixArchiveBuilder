'film: hackers, .k
The newest genre to emerge
from Hollywood, the so-
called 'cyber-thriller' which
bases itself on the Internet
hasn't
(witness The Net, or Johnny
Mnemonic). Until now, thai
is.
Hackers revolves
around the new breed of
youth, those with super-
competent computer skills,
the bane of all major companies. Jonny Lee
Miller (Sick Boy in Trainspotting) plays Dade aka
Crash Override aka Zero Cool, a computer
genius who caused the largest computer crash in
Wall Street history when he was only eleven and
was consequently banned from going near a
computer until his eighteen birthday. Having just
moved to New York and turned eighteen, he has
lost none ofhis skills and soon establishes himself
amongst the local hacker elite, Acid Bum, Cereal
Killer, Lord Nikon, and The Phreak. When one
of their number accidentally uncovers a plot to
steal millions they go up against The Plague, a
master hacker who intends to cover his own
tracks byframingthem for the crime.
By fully embracing the technology, making it
integral to the plot rather than simply a plot
device, Hackers is able to escape the trap that
previous films have fallen into. Rather than
assuming that all the techno-babble and hard-
ware would frighten off much of his audience,
the director Iain Softley has adapted it to
become accessible to everyone, using swish
graphical effects to represent what is going on.
This is a very fast-paced and stylish movie;
all the leads are street-smart and roller-blade
everywhere. The script is sharp and funny; the
antagonistic relationship between Crash
Override and Acid Bum (Angelina Jolie) is espe-
cially good, despite its predictability (Crash and
Bum, geddit?). The weakest links are the NSA
agents and Lorraine Bracco's corporate bimbo
accomplice. Fisher Stevens makes a suitably
slimy bad guy, and Miller is reasonably convinc-
ing as an eighteen-year old.
Hackers is a highly enjoyable, youthful film
and the first of the new breed of thrillers worth
watching.

Set in Ireland during the mid 1950's, Circle of
Friends is a gentle revolving around Benny
(Minnie Driver), a rather frumpish girl from a
small village who falls for blue-eyed wonder boy
Jack (Chris O'Donnell) at university in Dublin.
The heartaches are provided when one of her
best friends, Nan (Saffron Burrows), becomes
pregnant by the English 'Lord of the Manor'
(Colin Firth).
There is nothing particularly remarkable
about this film, being neither bad nor especially
great. The dominance of rural Irish-Catholicism,
emphasising that sex outside marriage is a mor-
tal sin, helps to give the coming-of-age tale a new
angle, but the story as a whole moves fairly slow-
ly and fails to captivate. In fact the sub-plots
involving Benny's two friends Nan and Eve
(Geraldine ORawes) are often more interesting
than the main story. Not that this has anything to
do with the lead, Minnie Driver in her film
debut, is more than competent carrying a lot of
the picture herself, it is more the fault of the
script. ,
This is a quiet, gentle little picture: it's unre-
markable, but a lot better than much of the trash
you could see.

Jodie Foster is Nell, a woman who has spent all
her life living a hermit-like existence in an isolat-
ed woodland cabin. When she is discovered by
doctor Ham Neeson with only her dead mother
for company, she is gibbering an incomprehensi-
ble language. Keen to prevent Nell from being
institutionalised for research purposes, Neeson
and psychologist Natasha Richardson observe
Nell for three months in her own environment
to help the courts decide what her future will be.
As they attempt to help Nell integrate into
the modem community, doctor and psychologist
learn to understand Nell's language and by doing
so, they finally obtain her trust and friendship.
Where the film succeeds most is in portray-
ing Nell's vulnerability as a potential victim of the
media and the curious public, but the film
requires some suspension of disbelief. Nell
seems surprisingly well-groomed and healthy
despite having lived in the wilderness for all her
life, and the courtroom scene where Nell makes
a speech while her doctor translates, is particu-
larly unconvincing.
Already the winner of two Oscars for her
roles in The Accused and Silence of the Lamb
seems that Foster was trying her damnedest to
gibber her way to a third. Some mightfindher
performance irritating and a means of showing-
off, but there's no denying that it is afineand
convincing one.
