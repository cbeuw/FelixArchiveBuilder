The Home Office has
announced that it intends to
make standard forms for
applying for a variation of
leave compulsory from this

an application to vary leave
is not on an official form and

If you are working over the
summer vacation (or any
other) then you should
obtain a form P38S which
should be completed and
returned to your employer.

hold of a form from either
your local tax office or
through your employer. Any
excess income tax deducted
while waiting for this to be
processed will normally be
repaid by your employer.
Alternatively it can be
reclaimed from the Inland
Revenue, normally at the
end of the current tax year

to complete.
2. Provide all the necessary
documents with the form
within their current leave to
remain.
The wording from the Home
Office implies that an
incomplete application will
be rejected outright (current-

total income for the current
tax year is below your per-

following are not taken into
account as income:
1. Student Grant
2. Scholarships
3. Most research awards
4. Housing Benefit
You will however have to
pay national insurance con-
application to vary leave
while waiting for additional
documentation). If not cor-
rectly re-submitted before
the visa runs out, then the
applicant will technically
become an "overstayer" and
be liable to deportation.
The Union Advice Office
will have copies of the forms
by Mid-May. They will also
be obtainable directiy from
the Home Office.
tributions if you are going
to be earning over £61.00
per week. If you do not
have a national insurance
number, you must apply for
one via your local
Department of Social
Security. They will gener-
ally only be issued if you
already have found employ-
ment. Students from out-
side the EEA must ensure
that they have complied
with any requirements to
seek permission from the
Department of Employment
before starting any kind of
work.
