How to dump someone (you met in Metric and
subsequently fell in love with)
Everyone knows breaking up is horrible. We’re here to make the process better for you (although
probably worse for the other person)
JUST THE TIP

Y
ou were weak. Despite our foolproof guides on how to have a one night stand (in Metric), ‘How to have a one night stand (in Metric)’, and how not to fall
in love with someone (from Metric), ‘How not to fall in love with someone (from Metric)’, you went ahead and fell in love with someone (from Metric) and
now you’ve been stuck in a relationship with them (someone you met in Metric) for months. Somehow, this relationship still sort of revolves around Metric.
Congratulations, you’re trash. But, just like a gastrobug, it’s run its course, and more importantly, summer is nearly here and you want to bang some hotties in
a hostel in Indonesia as you travel around trying to find yourself. Or, it’s your final year, and you’re ready to Gold Rush. You can’t do that with a relationship,
or a gastrobug. So you want out. But how?

Smother them with love
Give them so much love that they can’t even cope. Be
there every waking hour with a compliment. Be there
in their sleep. Be ever present, oppressive with love
and undesired affection.
Be a dick
Piss off their house-
mates so much that
their friends insist
that they break up
with you. Force their
hand. Tommy and
Gina never back
down. Unfortunately
it could backfire,
and you could be
coerced into getting
a love pad. Avoid at
all costs.
Be extremely clingy
Change their contact name on your phone to
“The One”. Show them. Look proud. You’re
trying to freak them out with emotional prox-
imity. You’ll know you’ve succeeded if you can
see the terror in their eyes. If not, escalate.
Create false
intimacy by
sharing false
secrets
Like maybe tell them about that
time you killed your ex’s dog,
because they were spending too
much time together. That could be
them. You could be like Alex in
Fatal Attraction. Only your bond is
important...
The long game
It’s all backfired, and they’re even
more in love with you now. Stop
trying, you’re clearly meant to be.
If you don’t manage to kill your
relationship, marriage probably
will, so get out there and start
shopping for engagement rings.
The sooner you get this over with,
the sooner you can get divorced
and finally be free. You might need
a child or two to drive them away
but that’s what boarding schools
are for.
The high stakes play
It’s now or never, book a really extrava-
gant holiday six months in the future. Once
there’s no chance that you’ll get your money
back, it’s almost guaranteed that you will
break up. Hopefully, by the time you’re
ready to hit Hawaii you’ll be single and
ready to mingle.
The reverse ghost
Constantly call and text them,
and ask why they’re not calling
you back. Feign being ghosted.
Demand to know why they’re
ghosting you! It’s your life, how
could they do such a thing?!
Swamp their
social media
This is for the ones who’ve stood
their ground. Start taking loads
of photos of them sleeping and
post them on Facebook. Caption
them, “I wish you were here.
Closer. Inside me.” Yeah we
don’t know either, you freak.
Get a tattoo of their
name on your body
Show them your new tattoo. Repeat-
edly. Show their friends. Show their
mum. Don’t tell them it’s not a real
tattoo, it’s a transfer tattoo, obviously.
You’re not an idiot, you don’t really
love them. There’s only space for one
man on your skin and that’s Jon Bon
Jovi. You ain’t gonna live forever, so
this relationship needs to die. Now.
Cool things
down
Forget your anniversary,
their birthday, maybe even
their name for a second
there. Keep reminiscing
about things you didn’t do
with them. “Remember when
we went to M&M World?
Oh wait no that wasn’t with
you”. Ask them how many
siblings they have at least
twice a week. And always
make their tea wrong.
Use all the clichés
They will have never heard them before
because they are Imperial students and it’s
unlikely that they will have had an extensive
love life. But flip them round for clarity. You
don’t still want to be friends, it really is them,
not you. You did mean to hurt them, and
you will love again soon you’re sure.
The fake cheat
Manufacture a scenario where they find
you cheating on them (possibly using the
friend finder app). If they’re not the snoopy
type you’ll have to get creative. Pay some-
one to throw their drink in your face at a
restaurant in front of your partner, saying
something like “You said she was fat and
ugly!”. Hopefully you’ll shortly get another
drink thrown in your face.
The unwelcome guest
Make them really unwelcome in your space. If they’re
allergic to cats, get a cat. If they’re not allergic to cats, get
a mean cat that likes to bite. It sounds like a lot of effort but
maybe your pet will end up being a social media star and
you can be a full time YouTuber. Then you’ll definitely be
broken up with.
Spread the love
Keep saying you want to open
up the relationship. Tell them,
“I just don’t think that there’s
a finite amount of love that I
can give”. Unless you’re poly,
in which case you’re probably
already so used to communicat-
ing that this whole thing really
ought not to be a problem.
Keep pushing for a threesome
with their hot best friend. They’ll
either oblige or refuse, which
you can use later. It’s a win-win
situation. Once they agree to
the threesome, have the three-
some, and then dump them
immediately after because you
think they’re cheating on you
with the other person.
Just ghost them
If they persist, change your
number. If they show up at your
flat or your department, move
house, transfer universities, burn
off your fingerprints and start a
new life in suburban Spain. You’re
Alex Macgee now. Embrace it.
Prove their friends right
They were warned by their friends about you,
now it’s time to prove them right. Spread rumours
about your own infidelity. Then lie, say you’ve
been cheating on them for months. Lying to them
is kinder than being honest with them: they’ve
taken such a toll on your appearance and street
cred that no one could possibly want you, and
of course there’s not someone else. All you want
really is to sit at home in your underwear eating
Ben and Jerry’s straight from the carton and
masturbating over that hot girl from Biology’s
Instagram. Why can’t you just be alone?!
It’s time to talk about your
feelings. Just do it some-
where public. Maybe on a
bus. Right as they’re getting
off.
Or, fake your own
death.
Failing all that, send them this flow-
chart from felix. You’re welcome.

The
final choice
If they resist breaking up with you despite all
these measures, you need to do something drastic. The
fact alone that they still want to be with you
means they’re a sociopath and you
need to end this relation-
ship fast.
You
have two
options
Obviously the grown up thing to do is sit them
down and have a conversation with them, but you’re not
ready for that. You’re a pathetic excuse for a human being,
and you forgot to pack your spine when you were
moving into halls. You’ve chosen to go down
the route of making them break up
with you. Nice job.
