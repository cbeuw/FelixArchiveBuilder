aturday the 27th
of May saw
the final event
in the London
Universities
and Colleges
Athletics (LUCA) outdoors
championship take place.
The series of three athletics
meets between the London
universities had previously
visited St. Mary’s and
Woodford athletics tracks,
and the destination for
the final was Battersea’s
Millennium Arena.
The warm but windy day
began with a 1-2 for Imperial
in an excellent women’s
1500m led home by Kate
Olding in a time of 4:57.16,
closely followed by Sarah
Johnson in 5:03.29 and
Ophélie Meuriot finishing 5th
in 6:11.17.
The men’s race saw some
good performances too, with
Fergus Johnson (4:54.13)
and Duncan Hunter (4:58.90)
competing in the first heat,
and Duncan Ingram (5:01.51)
and Lawrence Tse (5:48.01)
running in the second.
Meanwhile, five Imperial
athletes competed in the long
jump; David Fong leapt 5.94m
– enough to finish 2nd
on
the day – with multi-eventer
Hunter jumping 4.49m and
Jack McKeon 4.22m. In the
women’s event, Zhen Wang-
Koh flew 2.99m and Meuriot
reached 2.84m shortly after
her 1500m. Wang-Koh later
went on to clear 1.20m in the
high jump.
In the 100m sprints, Impe-
rial’s Paul Guillon ran 12.83,
with Stefan Renstrom finishing
in a rapid 12.21, and Hunter
running an impressive 13.07
after his 1500m and long
jump. Hunter and Guillon
then went on to run the 200m
in times of 26.86 and 26.01
respectively. Not satisfied
with two sprint events, Guillon
next ran the notoriously
difficult 400m to post an
impressive 56.20.
In the even more difficult
women’s 400m hurdles, Jenny
Lea ran 1:36.16, despite
having never jumped over
a hurdle before! She also
hopped, skipped and jumped
valiantly in the triple jump.
With the sun beating down
on the Battersea track, a
water station was set up
for the longest event of the
day – the 5000m. In her
third of six events, Ophélie
Meuriot finished strongly to
run 23:55.77, just ahead of
Catherine Spurin’s 24:14.17.
In the men’s event, McKeon
posted a new personal best
of 18:04.92 despite the heat,
gusts on the back straight of
the track, and suspect water
delivery from his teammates.
McKeon then went on to
compete in the 800m, running
2:28.71, just behind Duncan
Ingram’s 2:27.58, finishing
3rd
and 2nd
respectively in the
second heat. Imperial’s future
athletics captain Max Thorp
earlier posted a speedy
2:10.46 to finish 5th
in the first
heat.
In the women’s 800m, wom-
en’s captain Alex Mundell ran
extremely well to finish 3rd
in
2:24.16.
Next was the turn of the
spectators’ favourite – the
steeplechase. This event
involves hurdling five large
barriers (91.4cm for men) per
lap over two or three km, with
water jumps to contend with
each lap too. A crowd typi-
cally gather around the water
jump, with plenty of splashes
and tumbles occurring during
each race. Representing
Imperial in the men’s race was
Duncan Ingram, who went
on to finish in 12:31.00 after
a surge in pace on the penul-
timate lap to ensure he was
not lapped by the eventual
winner!
Over in the field events,
Athletics Captain Raul
Rinken came 2nd
in the shot
put, throwing 10.47m, while
James Davis reached 7.70m
and multi-eventer Ingram
threw 5.86m. Davis and
Ingram also competed in the
javelin, with throws of 26.81m
and 20.04m respectively.
Davis also entered the discus,
throwing 17.69m, while
Rinken won the event by
over 7m with a huge throw of
36.38m.
In the women’s events Liv
Papaioannou came 5th
in
shot put with 7.21m, ahead
of Mundell with 5.79m. Both
Papaioannou and Mundell
also threw the javelin along
with Meuriot, with Papaioan-
nou finishing 3rd
with 23.91m,
ahead of Mundell’s 15.88m,
and Meuriot’s 8.50m. Meuri-
ot’s final event was the discus,
in which she threw 9.45m.
Some of the most exciting
races of the day were the
relay races. Imperial’s
4x100m teams finished in
48.84 and 63.82, and the
men’s 4x400m team came
home in 4:19.19.
In the medley relay, a
special event which has
200m, 400m and 800m legs
and both men and women
competing in one event,
Imperial assembled a strong
team enough team to podium;
finishing 3rd
in 7:49.55.
As the event was the 3rd
and final meet of the series,
medals were presented for
the highest points scored
in each discipline over the
course of the championship.
Overall, bronze medals
went to Women’s Captain
Alex Mundell for 800m and
our medley relay team, silver
medals to next year’s Athlet-
ics Captain Max Thorp for
800m, Liv Papaioannou for
javelin, David Fong for long
jump, and Athletics Captain
Raul Rinken for shotput and
gold medals to Kate Olding
for the 1500m and Raul for
discus.
In the final standings, Impe-
rial managed a respectable
4th
place out of all the compet-
ing universities and colleges,
behind UCL, King’s and LSE.
Special thanks go to Imperi-
al’s Matt Douthwaite and Shiv
Patel for all their hard work
and dedication in organising
the championships.
