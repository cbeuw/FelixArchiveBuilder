FREEZE PEACH C O M M E N T
It's not rational
to be scared of
terrorism
An anonymous writer thinks you
should stop making this all about
you
An ode to
Shepherd's
Bush
Tessa Davey really, really loves
Shepherd's Bush, and she wants
you to know why
E
verytimethere’saterroristattack,
the more skittish of my friends
set about panicking. Marking
themselves safe on Facebook,
making dramatic social media
posts, and generally creating the
hysteria and alarm that follows a terrorist
attack.
If a chemical weapon had been used, or
if the numbers affected were large, then a
response of this kind would be more logical.
But your friends and family are far more
likely to be killed on their commute than
in an attack, and you don’t wish everyone
good luck on their travels every morning.
It’s not rational to be paralysed by fear.
You probably don’t know one of the very
few people who died: there are millions of
people in London. If you are affected, you
have my earnest sympathies, but for the
vast majority of people who won’t person-
ally know anyone who has been impacted
by this recent spate of attacks, save your
energy.
Social media starts buzzing with hysteria,
macabre fascination, and – face it – excite-
ment. Among the posts about prayers for
London and Facebook safety checks, mes-
sages appear offering rooms to those who
are stranded away from home. These posts
– to friends – are entirely self-indulgent.
Anyone in need of help will let you know,
keeping their plight as private as they
would like it to be. #RoomForLondon can
help people who may not know anyone in
the city, but posting on Facebook – reach-
ing a small network of your friends – serves
only to draw admiration. Demanding reas-
surance and declaring your benevolence
makes these attacks all about
you.
We should talk about these
attacks. We should honour the
victims – their suffering is real
and tragic and should not be
in vain – but we should not
pretend that they are anything
other than what they really
are: a drop in the ocean of
people who die before their
time, an outlying occurrence,
a freak incident. We can’t com-
pletely prevent attacks, but in
a city where the situation was
resolved within eight minutes,
we don’t need to lose our
minds.
Perhaps I lack empathy, but
I just don’t get it. Did you pre-
viously lack the understanding
that there was a very real
threat? London is safer than
just about any other large met-
ropolitan area. The threat is
real, but it is minuscule. You’re
entitled to be afraid; it’s good
to empathise with the victims
and the families of the people
who have died and suffered
life-changing injuries. But
don’t act like we’re in any more
danger now, don’t talk about
how it could have been you
because you passed through
London Bridge on the tube
three days earlier.
You are as safe as you always
were, so stop acting like this
changes anything.

I
've lived in various places
all over London over
the last eight years, but
I always come back to
Shepherd’sBush.It'snotthe
geographical convenience
or the relative cheapness that
keeps me there, it’s the fact
that Shepherd’s Bush feels like
home.
I feel at home on the Green,
with its gently undulating
mounds. It’s where I had my
first kiss with a boyfriend,
and where I've spent balmy
summer evenings lying on the
grass, drinking wine from the
bottle and smoking until my
lungs burned, musing with
friends over ill-advised text
messages to crushes.
I love Shepherd’s Bush
Market, that resists
gentrification by having real
community spirit. Hipster cafés
are springing up but they're
embedded in the community,
with local area at the heart of
everything they do. You can
just as likely get Mr. Falafel
(reputed to be the best in
London) as goat curry (both
excellent choices) or you can
visit the Polish sweet shop,
the Australian store or the
Lebanese bakery that all sit
nestled next to a Caribbean
takeaway and a Nepalese restaurant, that
never fail to make me hungry as I pass.
In the evenings, the streets fill with
people talking, walking, and sitting in the
cafés and restaurants. Where other parts
of London become dark and deserted at
night, the pavements of Uxbridge Road
line with tables and people, light pouring
out from every window. It’s lively and
vibrant around the clock, a mix of people
from different countries, histories and
classes.
When there was a stabbing on my
street in 2009, the neighbours started
a neighbourhood watch to make sure it
didn't happen again. During the 2011
riots, people knocked on the door to make
sure that we were safe at home, offering to
drive and pick up anyone who was afraid
to travel. When I was knocked off my bike
by a careless minicab driver one evening
last year, a dozen people rushed over
to pull me to my feet and offer me seats
and glasses of water. I've been to street
parties where residents, whose families
bought houses when they were dirt cheap
after the war, ate sandwiches with young
immigrant families, students, and trendy
young professionals. Shepherd’s Bush
is somewhere that is truly a home to its
residents, more than a temporary place
that people pass through as they grind
their way through life.
There is something for everyone in
Shepherd’s Bush, where it’s crowded and
cosmopolitan, and where everyone jostles
for space without trying to push anyone
else out. I love Shepherd’s Bush because
it doesn't feel like the rest of England, but
it undeniably feels like the London I want
to live in.
