Dieselpollutionposesseriousriskfor
asthmasufferers
F
orty million British
people are living
in cities and towns
with illegally high
air pollution levels.
This alarming
statistic is in part due to diesel
exhaust, which according to
new research can directly
affect our lungs and make
respiratory conditions worse.
An international team of sci-
entists led by Imperial College
London’s National Heart and
Lung Institute recently found
that diesel fumes directly
stimulate nerves in our lungs
leading to reflex actions like
wheezing and coughing.
This is bad news for sufferers
of respiratory disorders like
asthma as inhaling diesel
exhaust could make these
conditions more extreme.
The new study is the first
to demonstrate exactly how
particles from diesel exhaust
affect the lungs by triggering
nerve cells. When diesel is
burnt it releases tiny nano-
particles called polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), which easily enter our
airways.
“It’s essentially because of
their small size that they can
be inhaled,” explains Lareb
Dean, a PhD researcher from
Imperial’s National Heart and
Lung Institute. “Inhalation is
our primary interest as res-
piratory scientists – clearance
mechanisms exist in the upper
airways but because of their
small size, density and shape,
nanoparticles are able to go
through the lungs and reach
peripheral areas like the
alveoli. Then we have these
questions of whether they are
able to translocate to other
areas of the body.”
Exactly how nanoparticles
like PAHs behave in the
human body is of growing
concern to scientists. “With
things like asbestos we found
out too late what the effect
was,” says Dean, “we need
to do studies to carry out risk
assessment for the potential
effects of chronic exposure to
other nanoparticles.”
The new finding emphasises
the need to address the wor-
rying levels of air pollution in
big cities in order to protect
public health. “People with
pre-existing lung disorders
are most at risk,” says Dean,
“particularly people with
asthma and COPD (chronic
obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease), as well as people that
are occupationally exposed
to diesel fumes, like lorry
drivers.”
Lucy Gumbiti-Zimuto,
a medical student at the
University of Cambridge, has
been suffering from asthma
for the past 12 years. “I’ve
had asthma since I was 10,”
she says, “I have noticed that
when I come to London, or
I’ve been in London for a few
days especially, I get more
asthmatic, develop a slight
cough and have to use my
inhaler more often.” UK air
quality is currently very poor;
in fact pollution levels in cities
like London and Birmingham
are technically illegal accord-
ing to standards set out by the
EU. The government recently
published new plans to tackle
air pollution but these have
been criticised for being too
weak.
“I am concerned about
high pollution as my asthma
isn’t that bad so people
who have it worse must get
really bad symptoms,” says
Gumbiti-Zimuto, “it worries
me not only for my health but
for everyone else’s – it might
cause increases in things like
lung cancer.”
“It concerns me,” adds
Dean, “because my research,
as well as the body of litera-
ture out there, has shown that
increases in particulate matter
like diesel exhaust leads to an
increase in mortality risk. The
epidemiological evidence is
really robust.”
As well as exacerbating
conditions like asthma, PAHs
are known to cause cancer.
So why is diesel still being
burnt? The government is
under pressure to implement
charges on diesel cars enter-
ing cities but is reluctant to do
so having previously encour-
aged drivers to purchase
them due to lower carbon
dioxide emissions. To combat
the issue, legal activist group
ClientEarth will take the
government to court to chal-
lenge its failure to effectively
address the UK’s air pollution
crisis so far.

Once upon a time,
Erasto Mpemba was
making ice cream in
his cookery class. The sign of
a good scientist? He noticed
thatthemixfrozefasterifitwas
hot, rather than just eating it.
First observed in the
1960s, this experiment has
been repeated many times
since but, despite gallons of
warm ice cream, a satisfy-
ing explanation remained
elusive. As such, this phe-
nomenon has remained
a mystery – until now.
Time to get molecular:
Water is H2
O – one oxygen
and two hydrogen atoms held
together by covalent bonds.
The different water molecules
are attracted to each other by
hydrogen bonding. Now, Mr
Xi Zhang has recently pro-
posed that when the water
molecules are pulled together
by hydrogen bonding, their
covalent bonds stretch, which
stores energy. So, when the
water is heated, and the water
molecules move further apart,
those same covalent bonds
can relax, which releases
energy. And releasing energy
is the same as cooling.
This alternative cooling
mechanism works in addition
to normal cooling, and when
you do the maths, that turns
out to perfectly explain our
ice cream mystery. It may
seem counter-intuitive, but in
a cocktail-party emergency
you’re better off sticking warm
water in your ice cube tray.
This one was a bit too ‘sci-
ence’ – don’t worry, next
week we’re back to sex.

says.
Kevin Warwick, former
Professor of Cybernetics at
the University of Reading,
supports the idea of enhanc-
ing human capabilities using
technology. Warwick became
the world’s first cyborg when,
in 1998, he implanted a
microchip under the skin of his
forearm which enabled him
to remotely control devices
in the room. Since then, he
has been disappointed that

Sophie Protheroe discusses how robots are becoming increasingly humanoid, and how refining
3D printing is creating endless opportunities for new innovative technology
A
s we are
entering an
age where
robots are
becoming
more human,
so are humans becoming
increasingly attached to
technology. Scientists have
created a 3D printed ‘bionic
skin’ which could give robots
the sense of touch. This is a
major step towards printing
electronics onto human skin.
Cyborgs, part human part
machine, are no longer
confined to science fiction.
Researchers at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota have
developed a revolutionary
process for making stretcha-
ble electronic sensory devices
using a unique, custom-built
3D printer. “A 3D printer is
typically used to print hard
plastic objects – we want
to go beyond hard plastics
to the realm of functional
materials and devices, such
as electronic and biolog-
ical materials,” explains
lead researcher Michael
McAlpine, an associate
professor of mechanical
engineering.
So far, the scientists have
printed 3D touch sensors
onto a model hand. The next
step is to integrate these into
tools on a monitor, you could
actually give doctors a sense
of touch, allowing them to do
more accurate surgery,” says
McAlpine.
The researchers also inte-
grated a 3D printed sensory
device onto real human skin
and found that it was sensitive
enough to measure pulse. This
paves the way for 3D printing
wearable health monitoring
devices.
3D printed electronic
devices could become “the
tattoos of the 21st
century”,
says Andy Miah, a fellow of
the Institute for Ethics and
Emerging Technologies, USA.
Yet Miah is sceptical about
their usefulness for daily life.
“Having something stuck to
you on a permanent basis
would be quite limiting,” he
says. However, there is more
work to be done before
devices can be 3D printed
directly onto the human body.
“One of the key things in
being able to print on a real
human hand is being able
to track the small move-
ments of the hand,” explains
McAlpine. “We’re developing
algorithms now that can track

age person and give

motion; I think we’re close
to being able to put this 3D
printing device to practical
use and we’re pretty excited
about it,” he says.
The researchers say the
possible uses for 3D printed
devices are endless. They
could be used by soldiers in
the field to detect dangerous
chemicals or explosives. They
could be used to develop new
therapies for people who
have lost their sense of touch,
such as leprosy sufferers.
“People wear smart
watches on their wrist now
and that gives them extra
capabilities – you have the
whole world’s information on
your wrist,” says McAlpine.
“Taking that a step further

electronic implants. “Printing
on top of the skin [as opposed
to implanting under the skin]
reduces the chance of poten-
tial medical problems and I
do see it as an excellent, prac-
tical way forward for getting
more people involved,” he
says.
The integration of tech-
nological devices with the
human body is set to become
more accessible in the future.
Perhaps you’ll be able to
become a cyborg at the local
tattoo parlour. Maybe you’ll
even be able to do it yourself.
“You could take this tool with
you, put a 3D printer in your
backpack and print all kinds
of cool 3D objects,” says
McAlpine.
