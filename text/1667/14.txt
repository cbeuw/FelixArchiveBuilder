spills the beans
on what to look
forward to from
E3 this weekend
\\ Sony stole the
show in 2015 and
2016 \\
we will see any gameplay,
though that would make it all
the more exciting.
There is also the new
Spider-Man game from
Insomniac, which we saw
very briefly last year.
Insomniac are known for pro-
ducing fun, frantic games and
T
he biggest gaming
event of the year
and is right around
the corner; all the
biggest gaming
companies will be
taking the stage to announce
their plans for the upcoming
year and showcase brand
new games and consoles.
First up of the big three is
Microsoft, and they are in the
most interesting position of
all the companies attending.
Unlike Sony and Nintendo,
who have definite plans
and large releases coming
soon, Microsoft is in a rather
unique, and arguably pre-
carious, position. In 2016,
Microsoft shone the spotlight
on four major franchises on
Xbox: Halo, Gears of War,
Scalebound and Tomb Raider.
However, soon afterwards,
cancelled and completely
scrapped. Therefore, all
their previous showrunners
underperformed in some
way, which leaves Microsoft
with very little to show this
year in terms of established
franchises.
However, they have a
potential ace-in-the-hole:
Project Scorpio, their new
4K console, and the most
powerful gaming console
ever produced. It’s likely they
will sell the Scorpio as much
as they can but they need to
double down on the games.
The only games we know of
that may be given a definite
release date are Forza Mot-
orsport 7, which should show
off the Scorpio’s 4K visuals
spectacularly; Crackdown 3,
which has been stuck in devel-
opment for years on end; and
Sea of Thieves, Rare’s new
multiplayer pirate game. This
leaves them with a significant
amount of room to (hope-
fully) surprise and exceed
expectations.
Sony stole the show in
2015 and 2016, and going
into E3 this year it is difficult
to see how they can top their
previous showings. They have
a track record for surprising
and delighting fans with
their announcements, which
include the return of The Last
Guardian, the Shenmue III
Kickstarter, and the Final
Fantasy 7 Remake. This
year they still have a wealth
of titles to show off. Hideo
Kojima’s Death Stranding is
sure to make an appearance,
and after the two great, very
cryptic trailers we’ve received
so far it would be great to
see more of the world Kojima
wants to create. As the game
is very early in its devel-
opment it’s highly unlikely
definitely have both the skill
and pedigree to do the wall-
crawler justice, and another
good Spider-Man game is
long overdue.
God of War and The Last
of Us Part II are likely to be
Sony’s frontrunners, and both
are hotly anticipated. God of
War features an older Kratos
with a son, and after killing
the pantheon of gods in the
previous games, this is set in
the realms of Norse mythol-
ogy. The Last of Us Part II is
the direct sequel to Naughty
Dog’s critically acclaimed
The Last of Us, and the trailer
indicated that Ellie and Joel
would be on the hunt for
members of the Fireflies.
Finally, Nintendo are in a
great place with the release
of the Switch, and their Digital
Event will focus on upcoming
games. Their showrunner is of
course Super Mario Odyssey,
likely the most highly antici-
pated Switch game; we’ll find
out more about the gameplay
mechanics and stages, and it
will also be playable on the
show floor.
Splatoon 2 and Arms will
also be present and playable
at the tournament this year;
both will be heavily featured
and are evidence of Ninten-
do’s push towards esports.
Splatoon 2 in particular has
a lot of hype behind it due

previously, likely showing
off gameplay, and after the
critical acclaim the original
received it should have a
great showing.
Finally, the Mario and
Rabbid crossover game –
likely the worst-kept secret
of this year’s E3 – will also
be announced and detailed,
along with details on the
Zelda DLC packs, Virtual
Console and Nintendo’s plans
for their Online Services.
\\ Nintendo are in

Halo 5: Guardians and Gears
of War 4 both received
rather lukewarm receptions.
Tomb Raider was only a
timed exclusive on Xbox
and released on the PS4
the following year. Most
surprisingly, Scalebound was

to the warm reception of the
original, and this looks to be
taking the franchise in the
right direction. Xenoblade
Chronicles 2 will also make
an appearance after its
brief announcement trailer
