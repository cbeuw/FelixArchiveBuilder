Saad Ahmed fanboys about
why the Nintendo 3DS is the
greatest handheld console
to date
\\ Nintendo’s

that it has backwards com-
patibility, unlike some other
consoles *cough* Playstation
4! *cough*. The ability to
play old games is one of the
main reasons the “PC Master
Race” is a thing. On the
3DS, you can play any of the
games released on the DS so
that’s a further 2000 more
games you can play. On the
eShop, Nintendo have also
started releasing old games
T
he 3DS has been
the go-to portable
games machine of
its time, testified by
the sales of over 65
million units, and
is a shining example of how
to make a perfect handheld
console. Its only other
portable rival, the Playstation
Vita is as good as dead these
forgotten in dark bedroom
corners collecting dust.
To combat this, Nintendo
decided to change their mar-
keting strategy. They slashed
the price so much, people
claimed they were digging
their own grave. They also
stopped focusing on the 3D
gimmick and started to work
on actually making good
games. Slowly but surely,
the 3DS rose from its former
position until it became Nin-
tendo’s anthropomorphised
golden boy. Arguable even
more so than the Wii U when
it was released.
For a portable console
you can take anywhere,
the 3DS has an insanely
large collection of games.
There is literally something
for everyone with family
friendly, light hearted games
like Animal Crossing and
hardcore games like Monster
Hunter for the more serious
gamer. Nintendo also played
into nostalgia quite heavily
by reintroducing old games
such as Ocarina of Time
and breathing fresh life into
their old franchises like Fire
Emblem: Awakening, the first
entry of the series on the
3DS, breaking records and
bringing in new fans. The
games aren’t just pocket sized
versions of the main console
games, they are fresh and
engaging experiences that
stand in a league of their
own.
At the end of the day,
there’s basically a shit-ton of
games you can play on the
3DS and regardless of which
game you get, it’s almost cer-
tainly going to be good. With
just over 1000 titles, there
are multiple opportunities
for you to entertain yourself.
Another quality which makes
the 3DS so great is the fact
to buy and download so you
can even enjoy games from
literally 20 years ago.
The 3D feature isn’t com-
monly used these days, and
in fact, no one really talks
about it anymore. But once
you’re able to adapt to it, it’s
actually really amazing. Cut
scenes and battle sequences
are brought to life and
literally jump out at you. It
makes all the surreal worlds
and adventures all the more
engaging and impressive;
definitely worth the extra
battery drain.
Unfortunately all great
things must come to an end
and the same is true for the
3DS. People predict that it
has another year or so to go
before Nintendo decide to
move on. What comes next
is anyone’s guess. A lot of
people are looking at the
Switch as the successor, which
could be possible, but right
now, it’s still too early to tell.
Maybe we’ll get a slimmer
version of the Switch in the
future because at the moment,
it’s a little too big and clunky
and not exactly pocket size.
On the other hand, we could
get a console that’s a sequel
to the 3DS. What’s unique
about the 3DS and the DS
is that they both have dual
screens, so trying to adapt
the gameplay of certain titled
to the single-screened Switch
would take some work. Only
Nintendo can answer these
questions, it’s just a matter of
when; maybe E3 will reveal
some secrets.
Having said that, I still
believe the 3DS is a worth-
while investment. You still
have access to a large variety
of games which stand their
ground for the next couple
of years. With portability,
you also have the freedom
of gaming wherever you are,
even when you should be
paying attention in a lecture.

console of its generation, it’s

days, and mobile games
don’t even come close to
meeting the phenomenon that
is the 3DS. It has a large and
stable fanbase and its market
dominance has been absolute
for the past few years.
Things weren’t always
successful however, and early
reception was poor to put it
politely. When it first came
out, all the way back in 2011,
it’s major selling point was
that it packed the 3D without
the need for 3D-glasses.
There weren’t really any great
games on it at the time and
the 3D tidbit was all Nintendo
had going for it. Due to this, it
was overshadowed by other
consoles at the time and for
a long time, bought units lay

the ages and a means to play
many beloved titles from more
than three decades of gaming
history while on the move.
I know all this talk has probably whetted your gaming appetite, so next I’ve prepared a list of
recommendations of what you should be playing on the 3DS. (If you don’t see Pokémon it’s
because I’ve played and talked about it to death and maybe it’s time to move on)
TheLegendofZelda:ALink
Between Worlds
With Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask
being remakes of old titles, A Link Between
Worlds was the first original Zelda title
on the 3DS and boy, did it deliver. It is
an amazing production that is lovingly
crafted with nostalgia from previous
games and built to perfectly fit the speci-
fications of the 3DS. It makes a great use
of the 3D and has enough new features
to make it look exquisite. While most
Legend of Zelda games are a little more
hardcore and are for the serious gamers,
this game reminds you to have fun again and
marvel at beautiful sceneries.
Phoenix Wright: Dual
Destinies
One-half detective game and one-half visual
novel, Dual Destinies tells the story of defence
attorney Phoenix Wright and his subordi-
nates Apollo and Athena (I’m not kidding,
these are the characters’ actual names)
as they get involved in all sorts of adven-
tures in the name of justice. This game
is a good entry point into the series as
no prior knowledge is necessary. It’s a
bit light on action but it’s worth playing
if you’re a wannabe detective, animé
fan, someone who likes jokes and/or a
hawk-enthusiast (Play the game, it’ll make
sense)
Luigi’s Mansion: Dark
Moon
It’d be a disservice not to mention a
Mario game on this list but I’m going
to go with a spin-off title as opposed
to a main series game. This game
will make you laugh as you control
Mario’s lesser known, skinnier and
younger brother Luigi and basically
become a ghostbuster. Beyond that,
it has a nice multiplayer mode as well
as some cool features that make this a
fun enjoyable experience. It’s nice to see
Luigi stand on his feet and be resourceful
in taking down ghosts as opposed to playing
second fiddle to Mario like he usually does.
Super Smash Bros.
Super Smash Brothers is one the most popu-
lar fighting game franchises of all time and
one which everyone has heard of. The
fact that its latest entry was released
on the 3DS makes it all the better.
The newest addition to the Smash
Bros family introduces several new
players and stages, while taking the
series to new heights and reworking
its competitive edge. Admittedly,
there’s not much in single player
mode so this is a game best served to
multiple people. Just make sure they’re
on the same level of skill as you, otherwise
it quickly becomes you losing immediately and
watching the other players fight for half an
hour.
Professor Layton and the
Azran Legacy
This is the sixth entry in the Professor
Layton series, but one that’s written so
you can enjoy it with no prior knowl-
edge of the others. Professor Layton
is a series that is less about frantic
button mashing and more about
using your head to solve puzzles and
move the story forward. This game
features a rich world, full of colourful
characters, and offers lots of things to do
and even more player choice regarding in
what order you do them. If you want to take
things easy and like to actually think before
you jump, this is the game for you.
Fire Emblem: Awakening
The Fire Emblem series was on its way out
and it looked like only a miracle could save
the franchise. And indeed a miracle
happened, and its name was Awaken-
ing. This sequel combined features
from old games while streamlining
everything to make it suitable
for newcomers. It is an amazing
turn-based, tactical game with a
gameplay that gets you thinking
and a well-written story that keeps
you engrossed. It’s battle mechan-
ics are addicting and personally I
think Awakening is the perfect game
to bring in new fans and remind old
players why they love the series so much.
