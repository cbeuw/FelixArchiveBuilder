Whataweek
W
hat a week. Since last Friday,
shit has hit the fan. Much like an
evil mastermind in a superhero
movie, Donald Trump has
announced to the world his evil
plan to fuck over the planet:
quitting the Paris Agreement. The only differences are
that he’s as thick (but slightly more orange) as mustard,
and that the rest of the world has gone fuck you back
and is now probably conspiring to send him to deep
space, leaving behind only the faintest Cheeto-dust
trail as proof that he ever existed. Speaking of proof,
Comey has started testifying which is bound to be the
best thing to hit the screens since OJ Simpson’s trial. The
real question now is whether Trump gets impeached
and flees the US first, or whether California beats him
to it and goes rogue joining China.
Then on Saturday there were two terror attacks in
London which left seven people dead, 48 people
injured and thousands declaring themselves safe on
facebook.
But no one probably remembers the attacks anymore
anyway, because not only did they happen over the
weekend when everyone was shit-faced, but we’ve
also had to deal with the General Election, less than
a week after the London Bridge and Borough Market
incidents. (Also this is London and we don’t’ have time
to care for other people. )
Meanwhile we have Theresa May going around
making dirty confessionals, like that time she ran
through a field of wheat. I mean, how can someone
that dirty be trusted with the leadership of a country?
And that’s coming from me!
The thing that really pisses me off about the General
Elections is that we need to get this paper to the printers
by 11pm so there’s no way in hell we can provide any
insightful commentary (as per usual). Unless we wing
it. Which we did consider. A couple times. I’ve just had
the term ‘hung parliament’ stuck in my head all week.
Like how hung? Frankfurter hung? Beer can hung?
Baseball bat hung?
Back to my editorial though: Don’t be too
disappointed we’re not covering the Election results.
Just take this opportunity to read about all the other
depressing shit that’s happening in the world right now
and unwind with one of out thickest editions in weeks.
