Trump can't ruin
the environment
by himself (even
if he is trying)
Sara Hamilton thinks the withdrawal of
the US from the Paris Agreement is not
ideal, but the rest of the world can still
try to make a difference
T
here’s a lot one can
say against Donald
Trump, but thus far
he has stuck to his
word (or tried to a
least). After doing
his best to rid the US of ‘bad
hombres’, last Thursday
he proceeded to attack
another of his enemies – the
environment – by announcing
the withdrawal of the US
from the Paris agreement.
The withdrawal process is
expected to take four years,
but has already invoked a
large outcry from scientists
everywhere. Read below for
a full analysis for some of the
questions and answers of what
the deal is, why Trump pulled
out and the repercussions this
has.

only two other countries

greenhouse gas emissions
as soon as possible. Trump
referred to the deal as
‘draconian’, which hardly
seems fair for an agreement
that is, by definition, non-
binding and in which each
country plans its own
contribution to the combined
attempt to mitigate global
warming.
Why is Trump pulling out?
Trump claims to have pulled
out of Paris “In order to fulfil
[his] solemn duty to protect
America and its citizens”.
He has repeatedly dismissed
climate change as a hoax,
concocted by scientists and the
Chinese (the blame has shifted
between the two at different
points in time) to undercut US
manufacturing and his much-
loved oil and gas industries.
He did, at the same time, try to
reassure us in his speech that
he “still cares deeply about
climate change”. There’s some
Trump logic for you. As a result
the US, the world’s second-
largest emitter of greenhouse
gases, stands alongside only
two other countries worldwide
in not supporting the deal
– Syria, immersed in a civil
war, and Nicaragua, which
What has the response been
so far?
Trump’s decision has proven
to be largely unpopular.
According to the Yale
program on climate change
communication, 69% of all
Americans were in favour
of remaining in the deal.
Barack Obama, under whose
administration the US spent
years negotiating the Paris
Agreement, has criticised this
move as an abdication of US
leadership on the global scale.
61 US mayors have said that
they will work independently
to adopt the Paris accord
and sent a letter to Trump
saying “If the president wants
to break the promises made
to our allies… we’ll build
and strengthen relationships
around the world to protect
the climate from devastating
climate risks”. The Pittsburgh
mayor is a personal favourite.
After Trump stated that he had
been “elected to represent
the citizens of Pittsburgh, not
Paris” the mayor replied with
the statement “we stand with
the world and will follow the
agreement”. Furthermore,
global business leaders such
as Elon Musk and leaders of
companies such as Google,
Apple and hundreds of others
including major fossil fuel
producers such as Exxon
Mobil have urged Trump to
stay in the Paris agreement,
with Musk even quitting
Trump’s advisory board
altogether
What will the withdrawal
mean?
There is no doubt that
Trump’s withdrawal will make
it more difficult for the world
to reach the goals that it set
out to achieve in the Paris
Agreement, given that the US
is the second-largest emitter
of greenhouse gases, and has
also been a leader in financing
and providing technological
expertise in carbon-reducing
measures.
\\ 61 US mayors

What is the Paris Climate
Deal ?
The Paris Agreement is
an agreement within the
United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate
Change, signed in 2015 by
195 countries, which sets
a global goal of keeping
average global temperatures
from rising 2°C, compared
to pre-industrial levels, by the
end of the century. Its aim is
for countries to reduce their
believes the deal does not do
enough for climate change.
\\ The Environmental
Agency's policies
are still largely
intact, so it looks
like US citizens will
at least be able to
enjoy clean air until
Trump decides that's
a hoax too \\
Trump has said he is willing
to “begin negotiations” for
the US to rejoin the Paris
Agreement, or a different
climate agreement, on
different terms that are “fairer
to the US”, but it remains
unclear what these are. In the
meantime, the EU and China
are expected to move forward
as leaders in clean energy
and the fight against climate
change. On a lighter note, it is
likely that the energy future of
the US will not be as coal-filled
as one could imagine, due to
the falling prices of renewable
energy technologies and the
rising prowess of shale gas.
The Environmental Agency’s
policies are, for the moment,
still largely intact (sigh of
relief), so it looks like US
citizens will at least be able
to enjoy clean air until Trump
decides that that’s a hoax too.
All in all, this withdrawal
seems like just another
indication of the scary way in
which major world powers are
looking inwards, rather than
outwards, home rather than
abroad, and looking to make
their own countries prosper
rather than considering
international goals. It is now
time for the rest of the world
to rise up to the climate
challenge, with or without the
US. The Earth clock is ticking
and the effects of carbon
emissions don’t care much for
negotiation.

Charles Titmuss thinks that in order
to combat terrorism, we must first
understand its root causes
T
he UK has been
subjected to a
number of terrorist
acts. At this point in
time it is appropriate
to mourn and honour
the dead and remember that
nothing can justify these acts.
At the same time, it is important
to look at this topic with nuance
if we as a nation wish to solve
this problem. Two questions
need to be answered: what
are the driving factors behind
these attacks, and what can
be done to reduce the impact
that terrorism can have on our
daily lives? The emphasis in
this article will be on Islamist
terrorism.
\\ Deportations and snap-
imprisonment of those willing
to commit terrorist acts may
not be the best course of
action \\
internet, as well as proximity
to other people sharing
the same views, can serve
to entrench these feelings.
These feelings then need to
be inserted into a context to
provide direction and purpose
for their hatred. Islamism is
rooted in Wahhabism or Jihadi
Salafism, which preaches,
amongst other things, that the
West is fundamentally evil and
must be destroyed in order to
replace it with a version more
in accordance with their ideas
of absolute good. Proximate
examples such as the Iraq
war or bombing in Syria are
often used in order to further
justify the use of violence in
accomplishing their goals.
Therefore, looking to the
future, these attacks are likely
to continue, for a range of
reasons. Anger at certain
elements of UK foreign policy
is unlikely to dissipate. It has
been cast, incorrectly, as a war
on Islam by Islamist preachers
and with the current instability
in the Middle East, some form
of UK military commitment to
the region is likely for a long
period of time.
Secondly, there is the
presence of radical Sheikhs
and militant groups that
preach hatred of the West.
These personas are easy to
access on the internet and
often preach around the UK
in order to recruit vulnerable
people to their cause.
Militant groups especially,
but also some preachers,
rely heavily on funding from
states in the Middle East. A
recent report commissioned
by the Home Office looking
into Saudi funding of
terrorist organisations was
controversially buried as
it contained potentially
diplomatically damaging
information about Saudi
activities. Qatar recently had
diplomatic relations severed
with several different Middle
Eastern states over its role in
funding this form of terrorism.
The preaching of Wahhabi
and Salafist Jihadi movements
is also unlikely to go away any
time soon.
The economic and social
factors that begin the path
to radicalisation will also
prove difficult to remedy. In a
world of rising inequality, it is
possible that these problems
will only increase, and lead
made by all political parties.
Personally I believe that a
range of approaches are
necessary in order to lessen
the possible impact Islamic
extremism can have on the
UK.
Firstly, efforts need to be
made to restrict Wahhabi and
Salafist Jihadi movements and
the funding that they receive.
The repressed report should
be published and acted
upon to disrupt the powerful
individuals that wish to spread
violence around the world.
Secondly, more community
policing and engagement
is required. This is vital as it
would help provide a counter
narrative to that provided by
extremist preachers, and help
protect vulnerable individuals.
A significant amount of
radicalisation occurs within
the community, and a wedge
must be driven between those
who preach extremism and
intolerance and the rest of
society. Deportations and
snap-imprisonment of those
willing to commit terrorist acts
may not be the best course
of action as this could serve
to radicalise more people,
as well as reducing the time
taken to commit attacks.
The controversial Prevent
programme must be fully
funded, and better integrated
into communities.
Funding for the security
services should be increased,
but their powers for
surveillance should not. I am of
the opinion that they possess
the appropriate tools, but
not the means. An emphasis
on the role of the internet in
radicalising individuals should
be avoided. While it is a
critical battleground, social
media companies do not host
that much extremist content, as
\\ In a world of

In order for terrorism to be
enacted it is first necessary
to radicalise individuals.
Radicalisation can take place
for a whole range of reasons.
The first requirement is often a
sense of social and economic
isolation and exclusion. This
can take the form of relative
poverty, or suffering from
racism and discrimination.
This leads to resentment and
anger directed towards the
society in which they are
living, and is a critical primer
to radicalisation. Interactions
with extremist content on the
to a greater amount of anger
from those communities that
do not feel the economic
benefit and remain excluded
from society. It is worth noting
that these feelings of anger
only make people vulnerable
to extremism, and in no way
justify extremist actions.
Having ascertained that this
problem is not going away,
what can be done to lessen
the impact or even remedy
it? Suggestions have been
most has moved to places such
as Telegram. A recent report
by the BBC into IS militants
found that a significant
proportion were radicalised
by local preachers.
I believe that these efforts
would reduce the risk to the
public. We must not descend
into hysteria, we must remain
calm and remember that this
evil ideology will not defeat
us.
