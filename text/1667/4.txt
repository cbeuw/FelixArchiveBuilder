Union awards ceremony honours volunteers
RCSU President boycotts event Lef Apostolakis
M
onday saw
the Union
thank its
volunteers
at the
a n n u a l
Union Awards.
During the event, which is
meant to showcase the best
of Imperial College Union
and its membership, 69
(wink) students were awarded
colours, a further 19 were
awarded outstanding service
and a final five students were
given fellowship. The awards
are nominated, decided and
awarded by students.
“From campaigning to
innovation, sporting success
to academic representation,
community volunteering to live
events, there is an unmatched
depth and breadth of activities
at Imperial College Union”
said Union Managing director
Jarlath O‘Hara.
O’Hara, who came to
Imperial from LSE last year,
said he was excited to see the
breadth of activities Imperial
students were involved in.
“A world leading student
experience is about more than
just academic achievement,
it’s about a broader balance
education in which students
have the opportunities to
enjoy their free time, develop
skills, preserve their well being
and understand their learning
in the wider context of society.
“Universities, employers
and graduates all recognise
that students with leadership
experience gained through
extra-curricular activities,
are more desirable and
more valuable than students
who solely focused on their
academic work and didn’t’
take a chance to develop
themselves as fully rounded
people.”
Students were also
recognised across nine
categories. Campaign of the
year was awarded to Medics
of Imperial, a facebook page
that highlights confessionals
and tries to erase the stigma
surrounding mental health.
Community connections
volunteer of the year was
awarded to Antonia Evans for
her outreach, bringing coding
to school, and her involvement
with Amnesty International’s
Write for Rights campaign.
Project of the year was
awarded to Paediatrics Play
team, which supports children
at Saint Mary’s Hospital.
Contribution to College was
awarded to Islamic Society for
their Shake Break initiative,
which offered students a time
and place to chill, socialise and
enjoy some free milkshakes.
Mechanical Engineering and
The Centre for Environmental
Policy were recognised for
their undergraduate and
postgraduate representation
respectively, and Abhijay
Sood was awarded network
rep of the year. The newly
established City Varsity was
crowned event of the year.
Last but not least, Iris Drone
technologies were awarded
for their innovation and
enterprise. “Imperial is a
catalyst for taking students’
amazing ideas, and helping to
support and nurture these life
andsometimesworldchanging
projects,” said DPFS Rachel
Blythe. Founders Tristan Dell
and Debesh Mandal, who had
earlier this year been invited
to speak at the Union’s social
entrepreneurship scheme,
ACT Now , thanked the Union
for the help they provided over
the last two years and stressed
the importance of support.
“If you know anyone who
does any enterprise social or
otherwise I ask you to support
them, because any little bit of
support that you give them will
help them on their way,” said
Mandal.
Notably absent were several
RCSUcommitteememberswho
received outstanding service
awards. RCSU president Lloyd
James told felix he boycotted
the event. “I don’t believe they
were conducted in a fair and
open manner and I believe
Council was unfairly denied
the opportunity to scrutinise
the Awards process.” James
clarified that this was not an
RCSU boycott and that other
members were tied up in other
obligations.
Union policy was updated
earlier this year to allow
nomination from the floor
during Awards committee
session. James told us he
and other Council members
were concerned that “this
unfairly biased the awards
process towards those ‘known
to’ / friends of members of
the committee, and it went
against the spirit of an open,
level playing field provided
by an awards system with a
nominations process equally
accessible by all students”
Tessa Davey, who’s been at
Imperial for almost a decade
and was also honoured
with an outstanding service
award (again), and sat on the
awards committee, disagreed.
“The awards were conducted
in the same way as it’s my
understanding they’re done
every year. No students were
missed out because the out-
of-date student union policy
wasn’t followed. It simply
means that more students were
able to be recognised for their
hard work and dedication to
the Union. “
It should be noted that these
awards are purely symbolic
(with the exception of
fellowship which comes with
honorary life membership to
the Union and is generally
given out rarely). They aren’t
even accompanied by a
Nando’s voucher or curly-
fries.
\\ I don’t believe
they were conducted
in a fair and open
manner and I
believe Council
was unfairly denied
the opportunity
to scrutinise the
Awards process \\
Council Chair Abigail de
Bruin also disagreed. “I’m
honestly disappointed that
someone would take expired
policy and use it to try and
deny recognition for student
volunteers. After all, that’s
primarily what the Union
Awards are – a chance to
say thank you and formally
recognise the work of the
most outstanding student
volunteers. Personally I think
what would have been much
worse for the committee
would be to have not awarded
someone that they had noticed
was missed.“
Union President, Nas
Andriopoulos, acknowledged
that finding Union policies
isn’t the easiest thing, but he
maintained that all procedures
were done in accordance
with policy. “If Lloyd has
concerns with the way these
few [the awards tabled in the
meeting] were handled, he
must also have a problem with
how all Union Awards were
deliberated on.
“If he has a problem with
the committee’s judgement,
the Council Chair’s, or my
own actions I encourage him
to pursue a formal complaint
through this channel.
Finally, if I were a student of
Natural Sciences I would be
frustrated to hear that my
RCSU President has voted
against awarding deserving
members of our community,
or attending the celebration
of their achievements, without
consulting his members first.”
James told felix he does
not intend to pursue this issue
further this year, but he does
intend to propose a revised
Union Awards Policy next
year that will prevent this from
happening again.

Consent Matters pilot launched
Consent training could become mandatory from October onwards
Lef Apostolakis
T
wo terms since
consent training
became a subject of
contention amongst
Imperial students,
the Consent
Matters pilot has finally been
launched.
Consent Matters is an
interactive course aiming
at educating students on
areas of sexual consent,
communication and
relationships, and bystander
intervention. The creators of
the course , epigeum, claim it
“shows students how to seek
consent, how to recognise it
and how to identify situations
where it can’t be given.”
Bringing Consent Matters
to Imperial was an initiative
spearheaded by ICU and
supported and financed by
College. Though discussions
around the training course
have been going on for
two terms, the pilot is only
now being launched due to
difficulties with integrating it
into blackboard.
DPW Emily-Jane Cramphorn
told felix that “putting it on
blackboard means acquiring
more anonymised data
without students having to
manually fill in a lot of the
information themselves.”
Unfortunately a series of
unexpected difficulties with the
integration of the course into
blackboard and the staffing of
the project has meant that the
effort was abandoned and the
students will have to use the
epigeum platform at least for
the duration of the pilot.
As part of the pilot, 300
students representing a
cross-section of the Imperial
community were selected
and invited to trial the
training course. Though
progress seems promising and
Cramphorn herself has found
the training very informative,
she is cautious.
“I don’t know how people
will take it. I do think some
people will ignore it and
others will be resistant to it.
Earlier in the year there was
a lot of resistance and a lot
of debate and if you look at
other universities there has
been a lot of backlash against
consent training.”
Many universities have made
consent training mandatory
(last October freshers
at Oxford had to attend
compulsory sexual consent
workshops), yet students who
protest the training remain,
usually characterising such
measures as patronising.
The pilot should yield
feedback by August, meaning
freshers in October might be
welcomed by a compulsory
training course before they
take up their academic
responsibilities. “Ideally we’ll
be able to launch it as part of
the startup session in October,”
says Cramphorn. “We’ll have
a big media campaign around
it and potentially make it
compulsory. I know other
people in the discussions are
against this so we might have
to discuss it further.”
Cramphorn is referring to
several student voices who
protested the expenditure
last November. During one
of the first council meetings
of the year Lloyd James,
RCSU president, criticised the
£5,000 College expenditure,
and subsequently in a
comment piece published in
felix he said that “this purchase
will contribute nothing to
the student experience on
campus,” and referred to
the funds that went into the
licensing of Consent Matters
as “£5,000 completely and
utterly wasted”. The RCSU
General Committee also voted
unanimously to condemn
the expenditure, which they
described as “a wasteful
and ineffective method of
informing students on the
important issue of consent.”
Either way, it’s exciting to see
College tackling consent and
sexual violence, according to
Cramphorn. “It does go hand
in hand with the work we’re
doing with the catalyst fund
which is moving more quickly.
We’re already training people
to be sexual violence liaison
officers and Consent Matters
will only help to strengthen
that project and make it an all
encompassing project.”

needed. “Trump’s decision to
withdraw is really purely a
political one. It’s where most
Republicans align themselves
with,” she says. How this anti-
sustainability ideology works
is unclear. It might as well
be a communication failure.
“It might be not being able
to communicate with people
outside our usual audiences
but also not being able to
make messages meet the
value sets of different groups
of people.”
For now, Trump’s
inflammatory remarks are
just that, and are unlikely
to have immediate effects.
Already many other countries
have been turning green at
surprising paces. India and
China are making huge leaps
in sustainable development.
According to data from the
Central Electricity Authority,
India’s solar contribution
to electricity generation
increased by 81% in the
last financial year.
Meanwhile China
is considered a
leader in solar
expansion.
But even
with other
countries
picking up
the slack,
to mitigate
c l i m a t e
change we
will need to
eventually zero
carbon emission and
to achieve that we will need
global cooperation.

government could face legal
consequences as a result of
its inaction. “Legally

is required
to reduce
CO2, and
somebody
in the US

government
to court
b e c a u s e
they’re not
doing their legally
bound duty. There’s
also a possibility that poorer
countries in the world could
sue the US for loss and
damage, because they’re the
one that are being harmed
most by the actions of the
polluters.” Already a group of
American teens and preteens
are suing President Obama
and various federal agencies
for failing to protect the Earth’s
natural resources for future
generations. Imagine the case
they’d launch against Trump.
“I feel that Donald Trump
has declared war on us
and our planet,” says Sir
Brian Hoskins, Chair of the
Grantham Institute. “I hope
that the very positive actions
in many US States, cities and
companies and the support
from the majority of its people
will matter more.”
