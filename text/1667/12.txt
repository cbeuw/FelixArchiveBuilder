Archer S8

T
he ever popular
action-spy-office-
whatever comedy
returns for yet
another season;
one that again opts
to change the show’s setting
altogether. Given the show’s
relatively niche premise, and
its ever-falling viewership, it’s
quite impressive that it has
made it this far. It has even
managed to be renewed
through till a tenth season.
Not that I’m complaining,
given that I’m a huge fan
of the series. Over the past
few seasons, however, the
creative fatigue has become
clear, with the show’s creator,
Adam Reed, being quite
vocal that he’d like to move
onto something different. It
is no surprise then, that Reed
uses season seven’s cliff-
hanger to completely renew
Archer’s central premise,
going even further than past
efforts like Vice.
Season eight puts Archer in
a coma, using his subcon-
scious as an excuse to weave
a season-long detective noir.
As a tribute to the passing
of George Coe, voice of
Archer’s long-suffering butler
Woodhouse, the series deals
with a P.I. version of Archer
attempting to solve the mys-
tery of Woodhouse’s death
in 1950s LA. Opting for a
shorter eight episode long
season allows the telling of
coherent season-long story,
with tight pacing. The series
fully commits to the theme
and setting; gone are the
hallmark anachronisms, and
deliberately sliding timescale.
In fact, in many ways the
series feels distinct from the
rest of Archer. While many
of the characters share the
same characteristics of their
non-coma counterparts,
they could have easily been
replaced with new ones. The
season feels like a proof-
of-concept for an entirely
different show. Actually, this
proves to be a strength for a
season, as Reed deftly com-
bines the grasp the viewer has
with characters’ personalities
with new, and deeper, back-
stories to build a robustly real
world. This allows for subtle
alterations to their behaviour,
and prevents the fatigue that
would be expected after eight
seasons. As a result, one of
the minor issues that had
popped up around season
five is also resolved. From that

word\\ FX \ Floyd County Productions
season onwards, the show
had frequently resorted to
just making the characters
incompetent in order to gen-
erate laughs, something that
is no longer necessary.
The refresh of setting also
does much for the show’s
wit. In particular, the banter
between characters feels a
lot sharper and more tightly
paced than it has been in
recent seasons. The pacing
in general is one of the
highlights of this season.
Momentum is never lost, and
at no point did there seem to
be any filler. Unlike previous
seasons, every character and
incident has some role to play
in the overall arc.
In that sense, the show
really undergoes a tonal
shift. While it is certainly still
a comedy, it now very much
feels akin to something like
Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, or a
more humorous version of
The Long Goodbye. Accord-
ingly, if you’re just hoping for
more of the same old Archer,
you may be disappointed.
However, for me this is a wel-
come change given how long
the show has been going,
and thematically I enjoyed
this season far more than
any that have come before.
Visually, the series also gets
much darker than anything it
has covered before, and the
show actually becomes quite
serious at points.
That’s not to say there aren’t
elements to find
fault with,
of
Beating your meat meant something different
back then\\ FX \ Floyd County Productions
course. Most glaringly, per-
haps, are Archer’s recurring
WW2 flashbacks, that seem
like they’re building to some
crescendo, whereas in reality
they’re just sort of there.
This decision is particularly
strange and egregious
given how well Dr. Krieger’s
flashbacks are developed
and integrated into the plot.
Additionally, the resolution
to the central mystery is both
predictable and unsatisfying.
\\ While many of

Although, it is worth nothing
that this is, perhaps, a
conscious choice. Echoing
Coe’s passing, it is a reminder
that death is often random
and unsatisfying, and that in
truth things in life don’t have
proper endings. In that sense,
it is very much in the keeping
with the spirit of noir.
On the whole, the season
is an excellent renewal
for Archer, even if it does
so by moving away from
some of the staples of the
series. There’s a lot to enjoy
here, particularly for fans
of detective stories
or noir. However,
long-standing
fans may find
that it’s not
quite what
they
expect
or
wanted
out of
Archer.

An Ode to Sense8
T
hree weeks ago I
embarked on an
emotional binge-
watch of the 2015
Netflix original
Sense8. Within
two weeks I’d managed to
watch the 23 near hour-
long episodes of the first
two seasons. Then a week
later it was announced that
sense8 would not be getting
renewed, that episode
23 would be the last ever
episode, and just like that
I was heart broken. To
the uninitiated, the series
revolves around the lives of
eight strangers who one day
find themselves connected,
reborn as one as sensates.
They become a cluster of
eight people sharing their
lives, their existence; for all
intents and purposes from
that point onwards they
are a single fundamental
unit. That’s the cornerstone
of the title and this idea of
interconnectedness is also its
success.
If it sounds familiar it’s
because it is. Sense8 is the
brainchild of the Wachowskis,
directors of the Matrix and
Cloud Atlas. All three of these
pieces address in some way
or another the human condi-
tion, our place in the universe
and the nature of the glue
that connects us. In a way
sense8 feels like a philosoph-
ical sequel to Cloud Atlas
(written by David Mitchell).
Who can forget Somni-451
delivering her revelation?
“Our lives are not our own.
From womb to tomb, we are
bound to others. Past and
present. And by each crime
and every kindness, we birth
our future.”
While Cloud Atlas explores
the connections of human
lives across time, sense8 toys
with the same connections
across space. The fact that
Doona Bae (Somni-451)
happens to play Sun Bak, a
business woman/fighter from
Seoul in Sense8 and one of
the cluster’s eight is far from
serendipitous. A scene in
season two that puts Sun in
a near death experience,
causing every member of the
cluster to experience agony,
is possibly one of the most
nerve-wracking and emo-
tional scenes I’ve sat through.
Just like Cloud Atlas,
Sense8 succeeds as a result
of pandering to the ultimate
fantasy – connection. We
are alone in this world. No
matter what, no one will
ever be able to share our
existence completely. No
one will be able to fully
understand our views, our
feelings, or even something
as simple as the meaning of
turquoise. This is beautifully
put by Lito and Capheus in a
scene in season two where
they are asked who they are
by a journalist. “Who I am
is exactly the same as who
you are. Not better than, not
less than. Because there is
no one who has been or will
ever be exactly the same as
either you or me.” The only
force we have to mitigate the
crippling loneliness that being
human entails, is love, but in
the world on this side of the
screen love more often than
not fails to break the barriers
between humans. Behind the
screen however, by dissolving
this barrier that blocks human
connection the Wachowskis
get to titillatingly ask, what
if we weren’t alone? What
would life be like if we could
really truly connect with other
people? Perhaps playing
with this concept alone would
have been enough to create
great TV but the direction and
production ensure the mes-
sage is driven straight home.
It’s hard to describe exactly
what the Wachowskis do, but
they’ve undoubtedly create
some of the most beautiful
cinematic scenes I’ve ever sat
through (and honestly the sex
scenes are some of the steam-
iest and most breathtaking
scenes I’ve ever seen).
Most importantly though
they manage to really convey
the feeling of a no-barriers
connection between their
main cast.
And that leads to another
amazing consequence
– empathy. The cluster is
surprisingly diverse. A white
straight American cop, an
Icelandic DJ, a trans hacker,
a Korean businesswoman/
underground fighter, a
Kenyan bus driver, an Indian
biochemist, a German thief
and a Mexican gay action
movie star. It is unlikely that
anyone watching will fail to
identify with at least one of
the characters. But identifying
with one of them means iden-
tifying with all of them.
You’ll feel for Will losing his
father just as much as you’ll
feel for Riley losing her family,
for Sun taking the blame for
her brother’s embezzlement,
for Capheus trying to find
meds for his mother, for Kala
getting married to a man she
does not love, for Wolfgang
extracting his revenge, for
Nomi having her transness
rejected and for Lito being
called a faggot. Speaking of
gender and sexual identity,
this might be the first major
mainstream production where
I’ve felt some proper queer
representation. Nomi and
Lito aren’t just trans and
gay tokens. They’re fully
developed characters that
happen to be trans or gay.
This is not surprising given
that Lana Wachowski started
publicly addressing her
transness in 2012, while Lilly
Wachowski came out last
year as a trans woman. But
it’s certainly refreshing and so
very empowering as in some
ways the queer characters
are blessed with some of the
healthiest and most beautiful
relationships I’ve seen repre-
sented on-screen.
It’s unclear what has led
to the cancellation of the
series. Many have blamed its
outrageous budget (though
at $9 million per episode
sense8 is on the same level
as HBO’s Westworld and
cheaper than The Crown).
In a recent interview with
CNBC, Netflix CEO Reed
Hastings said they just had
too many hits in their hands.
Sadly that seems to mean that
if a title doesn’t prove to be
a mega-hit it doesn’t stand
a chance. Maybe a petition
will give Sense8 a second
wind. Until then all that’s left
to say is farewell. You’ll be
missed. You took us to places
we never thought we could
be taken and gave many of
us the representation we only
dreamed we could get. Thank
you.
