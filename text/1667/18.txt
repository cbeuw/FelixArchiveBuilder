This week you
decide to go on a diet
consisting entirely of
curly-fries. If you can’t
get a beach bod you’ll
at least have a bod as
wide as a beach.

This week you
decide to grow a
soul patch to match
your soul-searching
Southeast Asia
summer plans.
Congratulations.
You’re officially trash.
This week you’re
Donald Trump. People
are wondering why
you want to fuck
the planet. What
they don’t know is
that you’ve already
purchased Mars and
can’t wait to put it on
the real estate market.
This week you decide
you hate student
volunteers.
This week you’re
felix and you don’t
have any material on
the election because
you go to print right
as the polls close. This
is clearly a silencing
attempt by The Man.
This week you wake
up and realise you
slept through Thursday
and failed to vote. This
is all your fault. Oh
well.
This week you trade
your union colours for a
Nando’s voucher. Cheeky.
This week you’re
Sport Imperial and
you’re wondering if
you’re gonna get one
more shout out in felix
before the end of term.
Maybe.
This week you get
drunk with a bunch of
scientists from your lab
and wake up the next
day with five emails
offering you PhDs. You
didn’t even have to suck
anyone off. You think.
This week you decide
to apply tactical voting
to your exams. You
go to two out of three.
Resits will be fine.
This week you quit
drinking beer ‘cos every
time you taste it, all you
can think of is running
through fields of wheat.
This week you ask
felix to break up with
your significant other.
Sorry Phil. This isn’t
working out. It’s you.
You stupid fuck. Delete
my number. Sara.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS

Dear Chris,
Yesterday one of my houesemates bought me flowers. Big
woop I know. Only my girlfriend came over and saw them
and got really jealous (she’s a dom top).
My housemate only got them because they were reduced to
something like 50p but this innocent gesture has now sparked
a diplomatic incident.
I’m pretty sure the girlfriend is going to ‘surprise’ me with
a massive bouquet tomorrow (obviously hers have to be
bigger) which is great, only I’m actually allergic to flowers.
Also I’m afraid she might hurt my housemate. Maybe set fire
to our flat. Out of love.
Suggestions?
Best,
Viv
Damn,
Nothing makes my day like advice on how
to deal with a good dom top. I have to say, I
don’t know who you are Vivien but it sounds
like you’re loving it. And you should. Being in
a relationship with a dom top is like having
to care for a chocolate covered puppy. That’s
also covered in nails. Some of which carry
hepatitis. But if you can navigate straight to
the gooey centre you’ll never want out again.
So let’s see. Your daddy is jelly. Good. That’s
the hallmark of every healthy relationship!
It sounds like she’s gonna be getting you a
really big bouquet tomorrow. It will probably
be packing some pollen-heavy flowers, just
to make you suffer. But we both know that’s
what you really want from this relationship
anyway so let’s not make a big deal out of it.
All you have to do is fill your fragile body with
HOROSCOPES
antihistamines and persist. Make sure from
now on, whenever your alpha is in the same
space as your offending housemate you explic-
itly scorn them. Maybe spit on them in passing.
This should calm things down for a while.
Now on to the rest of your life: milking it. This
is your opportunity to get all those things you
always wanted but couldn’t justify the cost of.
All you have to do is pretend you’re getting
minor gifts from random friends or admirers
and your dom top will immediately try to...
well top them. A second hand scarf will turn
into a new summer wardrobe, an open mic
night will turn into Lady Gaga tickets and a
tamagotchi will turn into an actual puppy.
Next stop: gimp life.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
