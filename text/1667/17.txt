very single one
of us has as
some point been
lectured about
the dangers of
cocaine, Adderall,
and heroin. Take them once
and it might not be long
before you’re finding an
excuse to take them again.
Regardless of whether it’s the
oh-so-good high or a few too
many nights out one week,
you can easily stumble from
a ‘managed’ habit into an
addiction without realising it.
The risk of addiction and its
woes are hammered home by
our parents and teachers in
school, and most of us enter
University holding an oath
never to touch ‘those bad
drugs’. Financial destitution,
a septum on permanent
leave, and those “This is your
brain on drugs” PSAs haunt
our thoughts at the mention
of Class As. Yet despite this
oath (however long it remains
intact throughout our years
at University), many of us
become addicts in our first
week here. Our drug of
choice? Alcohol.
With Summer imminent,
excuses today become as
common as much : BBQs,
lads’ holidays, and epic trips
to find yourself in Southeast
Asia are all socially conven-
ient ways of fuelling your
addiction. An addiction borne
of the almost unlimited free-
dom gifted to us as freshers,
having moved out from under
the watchful eyes of our par-
ents and landed a seemingly
astronomical stipend from the
Government. After waving
goodbye to our parents on
move-in day, it is mere hours
before we are taking advan-
tage of the newly affordable
shot-racks in Metric. From that
day forward, grotesque quan-
tities of alcohol are consumed
on a near-nightly basis at
pre-drinks sessions and in the
Union at circles. Friends’ hair
is held up as they chunder
into a toilet, if they’re feeling
particularly conscientious,
or onto the pavement if not.
During freshers’ week, black-
ing out before you make it to
the club becomes a great ice
breaker rather than a wor-
rying harbinger of nascent
alcoholism. If someone told
you they regularly took a
drug which left them in such
a state, you would be con-
cerned, yet we regularly drink
booze in the name of fun.
For a lot of people, rampant
alcoholism, like other drug
use, is confined to a soon-to-
be-nostalgic experimental
phase, filled with embar-
rassing Facebook pictures
of those four months you
committed to growing your
hair out, or that Bob Marley
lyric you had tattooed on
your left ankle. University is
laugh at, and other things
that will go on to shape who
we are as people for the rest
of our lives. In the same fash-
ion, our over indulgence in
alcohol can continue past our
Uni days, with all the health
risks that entails. Just a three-
year stint of alcohol abuse is
seen as a rite of passage in
students’ lives, but we would
be horrified at the thought if
it were another recreational
drug.
Alcohol is a drug. It is
a depressant, resulting in
slurred speech, reduced
cognitive ability, focus,
perceptual disturbances,
and slowed reactions. Most
people drink it to relax and
employ their reduced inhibi-
tions by throwing shapes and
attempting to chat potential
partners up on a night out,
yet at higher doses its depres-
sant effects are felt in full
force. I’m sure I don’t need
to say more about the con-
sequences of overindulging;
many of us have experienced
them ourselves. Most of us
are also aware of its toll on
society. In 2014, there were
nearly 9,000 alcohol-related
deaths in the UK. Drinking
makes up 10% of the UK
burden of disease and death,
ranking it third in lifestyle
risk factors, after smoking
and obesity. Even moderate
use can have health effects,
from weight gain to reduced
exercise performance, while
heavy use can lead to serious
health risks such as cirrhosis
of the liver and oesophageal
varices, which can cause you
to literally spew blood. I’m
not advocating prohibition, all
I’m saying is that its uses and

risks should be considered
as thoroughly as they are for
other drugs.
I like a drink as much as
the next person. Alcohol is
deeply embedded in many
cultures as a gastronomic
pleasure and social enabler.
It is this long cultural history,
combined with the incredi-
ble lobbying power of the
Goliath alcohol industry that
exempts alcohol from being
included in drug awareness
talks, or most recently, the
Psychoactive Substances
Act 2016, which saw other
formerly legal highs banned.
In a society that prioritises
science as a means of know-
ing the world, we need an
evidence-based drugs policy
that gives fair consideration to
all substances based on their
health risks. As long as we
continue to ignore the facts,
substance abuse will take its
toll on our health and our
economy.
