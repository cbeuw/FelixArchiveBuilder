Are you close to passing out from
the lack of ventilation in the library?
Are you tossing and turning in bed
lamenting the passing of spring anf
the lack of an AC? Do your friends
describe you as a rice enthusiast?
Well we might just have what you
need.
I
’m back you fools and to
celebrate let me share a
story from my childhood.
When I was in elemen-
tary school, our teacher
used to teach us different
‘life hacks’ based on science
– she said. One of the most
memorable things she ever
said was that it’s better to
drink a hot drink (hot tea)
when it’s hot outside, if you
want to cool down. I don’t
want to say that this is bullshit,
but it never quite worked for
me. And frankly, you cannot
convince me that having a
hot drink will make you feel
better than having some ice
cream in a flaming hot day.
I’d normally make some
chilled treat or other but
as you might have noticed,
the fact that I have so much
revision *cough* learning
*cough* to do now means
I cannot lose too much pre-
cious time even with eating.
And because I truly, deeply
believe at this point of frantic
revision that I don’t need
sleep and/or that you can live
on coffee, I have found myself
at a culinary block which I
have resorted to solving with
one of my favourite Italian
‘things’: covfefe. I am sure
that you’ve had a covfefe at
least a couple times but you
might not be familiar with this
particular name.
The covfefe is going to
solve your enormous need for
coffee and your cravings for
sweets and you will not feel
particularly guilty for having
a break as this one has, in my
opinion, very few chances
of turning into another
let’s-watch-all-of-Orange-
is-the-new-black-in-one-go
incident. Basically, you just
make a nice-healthy-huge cup
of coffee and while it is still
hot, you take spoons of ice
cream and you eat them at
the same time with the coffee.
I have friends who just put
ice cream in the coffee and
then eat it, but I think that’s
disgusting. The special taste
of covfefe comes exactly from
the combination of very cold
ice cream and hot coffee con-
sumed at the same time – just
before the ice cream melts
into your mouth, taking care
of any potential minor burns.
And if you want to feel
fancy – fancier than downing
an ice cream tube – and if
you have enough time now
and you’ve finished your
exams, or if you want to
procrastinate with cooking if
you still have work to do, here
I am, presenting you with the
most impressive rice pudding
you can imagine!... Though
the truth is I’ve been way too
lazy to cook anything more
complex than this over the
past month. Instead I’ve suc-
cumbed to being a lazy-ass
student who uses restaurants
and deliveries as their main
sources of nutrition.
Regardless, my rice pud-
ding brings all the boys to the
yard. For real it’s the shit.

berry compote
Andrada Balmez
Ingredients
For the pudding
1.5l semi-skimmed milk
1 vanilla pod, seeds only
250g pudding rice
2 tbsp brown sugar
200 ml double cream
For the compote
700g mixed berries
100g caster sugar
½ tsp sea salt
1 vanilla pod, seeds only
juice of 1 lemon
1 tbsp cornflour
simmer for 25 minutes or until
it is tender – yes, this is the
best way to work those flabby
arms since you haven’t gone
to the gym once in the past
month. Depending on the
density of the mixture, you
might need to add some extra
milk. And muscle.
Add the brown sugar and
keep stirring. Remove from
the heat and, after it cools a
bit, refrigerate for at least 30
minutes.
In a separate bowl, whip
the double cream and mix
it with the cooled pudding.
Refrigerate for another hour
(at least).
For the compote, place
Place the milk and the
vanilla seeds in a pan over
medium heat. While stirring
constantly, add the rice and
200mL of water and all the
ingredients (except the corn-
flour) into a pan and bring
to boil. Simmer for 10-15
minutes.
In a separate bowl, whisk
the cornflour with 2 tbsp of
cold water (it should have
the consistency of a paste).
Slowly add the paste to the
berry compote and keep
stirring over low heat until
it thickens. Stir for 2-5 more
minutes and then remove from
the heat.
Serve the cold rice pudding
in some fancy bowls or
glasses and top with fruit com-
pote. It should be enough for
4-6 servings, but I know you
will eat it all in one go when
you’ve got dem cravings
only some mushy white ricey
goodness can satisfy. I won’t
mention sharing it with others.
That’s just blasphemous.
P.S. I missed you, but my
lovely exams have been keep-
ing me busy :)
