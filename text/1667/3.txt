Imperial academics on Trump and climate
The Grantham Institute spills the beans Lef Apostolakis
L
ast week Trump
declared to the world
that he’d be pulling
the US out of the Paris
Agreement. Within
hours, Elon Musk had
resigned from the President’s
Board of Advisors, American
states such as California went
rogue and protested the
move, vouching to uphold
their commitment anyway,
and world leaders expressed
their disappointment and their
determination to do their bit
for the planet.
Surprisingly, Trump’s war
on sustainability seems to
have united almost everyone
else against him. The acting
head of the US embassy in
Beijing resigned over his
country’s withdrawal from
the Paris climate change
accord. France, Germany
and Italy penned a joint letter
condemning Trump’s decision
(Theresa May reportedly
declined to co-sign the
statement). By Monday over
1,000 mayors, governors
and companies in the US
had expressed defiance to
Washington.
And yes, even North Korea
called out the decision,
branding it “short-sighted and
silly”.
Climate change is rightfully
the hottest topic of discussion
at the moment, so we talked
to some of Imperial’s leading
scientists to see what they’re
making of this turn of events.
And what better place to
find them than the Grantham
Institute.
The Grantham Institute does
multidisciplinary research,
engaging with staff and
students across College
interested in climate change.
Jo Haigh is one of the institute’s
Co-Directors and has notably
contributed to (and lead
authored) several reports of
the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, and was
more than happy to discuss
recent developments. The Paris
Accord was a triumph that not
only surprised everyone at
the time but keeps pleasantly
surprising scientists across the
globe.
“You can’t imagine how
fantastic it was, because
previous to that we had the
Copenhagen meeting which
was such a disappointment,”
says Haigh. “We were all
hoping there’d be a climate
agreement and it got
absolutely nowhere. This
time round we were thinking
if they can just agree on
anything it will be so good.
And not only did they have
a unanimous agreement but
they agreed to try and limit
global temperature increase
to less than two degrees
above pre-industrial [levels] or
preferably 1.5 degrees. This
was signed up and agreed
and then less than a year later
it got ratified. I think this is the
fastest any treaty has been
ratified through the United
Nations.”
The Paris Agreement
is based on voluntary
contributions to reducing
CO2 emissions. It has been
criticised for not providing a
legal framework for keeping
the international community
in check. Realistically, even
if signatories fulfilled their
pledges, we would be
nowhere near hitting the two
degree target. But that’s not
the point. (Besides, there are
mechanisms for reassessing
goals and moving action
forward every five years). The
success of the Paris agreement
lies in the declaration of
global intent to do something
about climate change and the
exit of a major player like the
USA jeopardises the spirit of
unity.
“The USA is estimated to be
contributing nearly 20% of
the world’s CO2 emissions.
Pulling out is no minor
event. The thought that the
US wouldn’t do anything to
mitigate climate change is
bad in itself but it could also
be bad in the sense that other
countries might think likewise
– if they’re not doing it, why
would we bother – and the
whole thing could unravel.”
Alyssa Gilbert, Head of
Policy and Translation at the
Grantham Institute, agrees. “A
lot needs to be done locally.
The issue is that you need
everyone to agree that we
need to make an effort. That’s
why we have these
big international
agreements. We all
need to play our
part, which is why
the US detaching
is distressing.”
Gilbert’s role bridges the
work and knowledge of
academic researchers and
the action stakeholders who
make decisions that impact
the environment, such as
NGOs and governmental
bodies. Gilbert essentially
ensures that the science is
effectively communicated
to the public and translated
into policy. Which begs the
question: What motivated
Trump’s decision? Was it a
communication failure?
Gilbert doesn’t think so.
“In no time in his speech
about leaving the Paris
Agreement did Donald
Trump say anything skeptical
about climate change.
Whether that’s because he’s
a climate skeptic remains
to be seen but the bit of the
story that’s telling us what the
science says about the world
around us seems to have had
quite a significant message
delivery over time.”
Indeed, not only has
scientific evidence for global
climate change been piling
up over the last decades,
some effects are frankly
impossible to ignore, such
as the very measurable one
degree increase in average
global temperatures since the
beginning of the conversation.
Gilbert thinks climate-
skepticism is not really the
issue anymore, instead the
real challenge is in convincing
people that
