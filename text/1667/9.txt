Giacometti’s
work has
always been
close to my
heart. He was
central to the wider body of
artwork that inspired me to
do art for GCSE and A level,
and I've based countless of
my own pieces on his. Despite
being known more for his
extremely thinly sculpted
figures, it was actually his
drawing and paintwork that
inspired the majority of my
work. When I found out the
Tate Modern was exhibiting
him, I sincerely hoped that
it would do his work justice,
especially as it was his first
large scale retrospective
exhibition in the UK for
twenty years.
Giacometti (1901-1966)
was a Swiss sculptor, painter,
draughtsman, and print-
maker, whose work mainly
focused on the human form.
As I walked into the exhibi-
tion, I was met with a very
unusual sight. In the centre of
the room were rows of busts
on plinths, arranged into
a square formation so that
visitors could walk around
them. These stylised depic-
tions of heads hailed from all
over Giacometti’s life, from
early naturalistic sculptures to
minute versions. It was clear
he held a lifelong fascination
with the face, particuarly the
eyes and their expression.
From there onwards, it
became apparent that every
room was laid out specifi-
cally to reflect his style and
interests at different points in
his life. The second room fol-
lowed his extremely abstract
surrealist work – bizarre
sculptures involving stones
and strings. Some take a

moment to work out, but they
all have names that guide
you along his train of thought.
A piece titled Disagreeable
Object cracked a few wry
smiles due to being slightly
phallic, and Composition
(Man and Woman), had
heads tilting to distinguish
which head was which.
My favourite room was
one holding a tiny collection
of figures and heads – all
encased behind glass with
plenty of space to appreciate
the beauty of each minuscule
piece. There was one no
bigger than the nail on my
little finger, which led me to
appreciate the craftsmanship
and overwhelming attention
to the most minute of details.
To Giacometti the act of creat-
ing such diminutive work was
just as much a philosophy as
a display of skill; “by doing
something a centimetre high,
you are more likely to get a
sense of the universe than
if you try and do the whole
sky.”
His main works were show-
cased at various points – the
famous walking man – a
bronze larger-than-life figure
chipped meticulously to the
sheer core of the original.
These stretched out people
became synonymous to the
post-war spirit in Europe,
representing the alienation
and anxieties that were rife
throughout the nations. His
works are deeply emotional
– a personal favourite was
one created shortly after his
father’s death. It was titled
Woman with Her Throat Cut
and looked less like a woman
and more like some sort of
insect. Despite its odd shape,
there is no doubt of the pain
and turmoil Giacometti was
going through when he cre-
ated it. His sculptures are not
just interesting to look at, they
make you feel.
His paintings complement
his sculptures – the figures
within them appearing small
and lost in the surrounding
frame. For some he would
even paint a small box within
the canvas itself, and then
paint the figure inside it, to
make it appear small and
diminished in a similar way
to his sculptures. His life
models were always those
closest to him – mainly his
brother Diego and his wife
Annette. Despite reworking
their features over and over
again through intense scru-
tiny, Giacometti was rarely
satisfied with the end result,
claiming that his work lacked
"likeness".
The exhibition ends with a
video, showing his creative
process and outlook on his
artistic inspiration. It was
clear he was transfixed with
the human face in particular,
and loved the way sculpting
makes use of the hands in
such a purposeful way. The
exhibition itself lived up to my
expectations, to say the least.
Each room is very different.
The mix of media – bronze,
clay and plaster sculptures of
all sizes alongside paintings
carrying his distinct style
made for a truly engaging
show. By following the rise
and progression of one of the
most prolific and well-known
artists of the 20th
century,
through times of struggle
when he made housing dec-
orations, to his late work and
large scale bronze sculptures
of the 60s, you leave with a
wealth of knowledge of his
work and character. Gia-
cometti would've approved,
“I don’t mind whether the
exhibition presents success of
failures" he said of one of the
exhibitions of his work during
his life, "I have no requests,
only to proceed feverishly.”
The show on at the Tate is
testament to a life dedicated
to exploration. This is a truly
phenomenal collection of an
artist who lived for his craft.
