O n T h e Rattle by Tom Stoppard.
Adopted from Johann Nestroy and
directed by Peter Wood. The Lyttelton,
National Theatre.
If y o u t h i n k y o u h a v e p r o b l e m s i n
communicating and that people misunderstand
what you say then you ought to see T o m
Stoppard's O n The Razzle at the National.
Y o u r problems are nothing in comparison to
Jthose of the characters in the play. Line after
line of dialogue abounds with comic confusion
a n d m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g , but t h e s e v e r b a l
tribulations are only a part of the troubles
beset by the characters.
A grocer's assistant and young apprentice,
played respectively by Ray Brooks and Felicity
Kendal, escape for a day and a night on the
two in Vienna. But they get much more than
they bargained for. The amorous adventures
of their boss, Zangler, also bring him to
Vienna. Played hilariously by Dinsdale Landen,
Zangler is a rotund, red-faced, irrepressible
m a n , w i t h a m o d e s t p o s s e s s i o n of hair
r i d i c u l o u s l y o v e r - c r e a m e d . H e s u f f e r s
tragically from word mixing. The chaos that
hits Vienna and the fast-moving comedy that
ensues reminds one of the lunatic antics of the
Marx Brothers.
Stoppard's O n The Razzle is at least the
fourth reworking of Johann Nestroy's play
Einen Jux-will er sich machen (He's out for a
Fling), which Nestroy himself pinched from
someone else. (Now there's originality for
you!). N e s t r o y was the king of V i e n n e s e
c o m e d y in the last c e n t u r y a n d u s u a l l y
performed in his own plays. H e was also an
opera singer until the age of thirty. What
Nestroy added to Viennese comedy in his time
was satire. The programme notes proclaim
that " h e l o o k e d at the h u m a n race, and
decided that the treatment it needed was
mockery." Nestroy wrote "I believe the worst
of any human being, even of myself, and I have
s e l d o m been m i s t a k e n . " H i s style wasn't
political satire, but satire on human nature
itself.
The original play on which O n The Razzle is
based is a play of its day. It is full of topical
references. It also plays games with the
Viennese dialect giving rise to a language full of
subtleties, cleverly mastered to evade the
powerful censorship that existed in that day.
Stoppard necessarily had to 'start afresh' in
order to m a k e the play intelligible, ano
humorous, to modern day English audiences.
The play's comedy rests virtually entirely on
the play of w o r d s . C o n s e q u e n t l y it your
English is not good, like the French couple
n e x t t o m e , y o u r e m a i n p o k e r - f a c e d
throughout the whole play. It is not my type of
humour, but it was noticeable that it was the
older members of the audience who were in a
near-permanent state of laughter. (Tis a funny
thing humour.)

Mean by J.P. Sartre, was presented by
Imperial College Dramatic Society.
Kean relates the tale of the Victorian actor
of the same name who realises himself and as a
consequence, which the story attempts to
necessitate, has to leave the profession in
which he is so lucid. The concept of acting, the
whole business of plays and the theatre, is an
obvious one on which Sartre could impose his
Cartesian melodrama. The play delights in
illustrations of games-playing, of inflated
artificiality assimulated as real from K e a n
playing Hamlet to Kean playing at being Kean
in London's rigid social life.
The presentation was formal but efficient,
with any doubts about the multiple points of
the play being lost in unnecessary stylisation
being dispelled as the main characters gained
strength. It could be said that some of the
existential pivots of the story, so dear to
Sartre, were sometimes a little underplayed
while other facets, such as the gay hairdresser,
were needlessly overstated. However, much of
the rougher humour of the play and amusing
subsidiary characters served to sustain the
plays length which, at around three hours, the
cast c o p e d w i t h v e r y w e l l . S o m e lively
techniques, such as planted members of the
audience pelting Kean with fruit, brought the
play off the stage and beyond strict formality
without any danger to the coherence of the
story as a whole.
The plot itself begins to flag in the final
scenes with S a r t r e ' s labouring on choice
threatening to dissolve into sentimentality but
t h e c a s t met w i t h t h i s g r a c i o u s l y a n d
a l t o g e t h e r g a v e a g o o d , e n t h u s i a s t i c
performance.
It is perhaps a pity that after the people
involved had obviously put in a lot of work to
put on a generally slick performance of Kean
that when I was there, Saturday night, the hall
was only half-full.

Quest for Fire, 20th Century Fox,
Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud.
Quest for Fire would claim to portray the
first romance in history, but the happy event is
not reached until a great deal of sex (usually
anal) and violence has taken place.
The film is set 80,000BC when tribes have
discovered the advantages of fire but cannot
create it anew. This means they must keep a
continually burning flame and fight other tribes
when their own flame is/has extinguished.
T h e s e fights are e x t r e m e l y v i o l e n t , not
surprising as members of the same tribe can
not really c o m m u n i c a t e , never m i n d two
opposing tribes realising that they can share
the same source of fire.
It is in this context that a relationship
developes between Naoh (Everett McGill) and
Ika (Rae Dawn Chong) from a more advanced
tribe who eventually shows Naoh and his tribe
how to make fire for themselves.
The couple meet when Naoh and two of his
tribesmen set out in search of fire and the
majority of the film consists of their encounters
with other tribes, mammoths (really elephants)
and sabre-tooth tigers. Although these scenes
are exciting and occasionally funny, at times it
is hard to believe a man could walk from the
Arctic to East Africa within a few feet of film.
The film was made on a large budget and will
appeal more to those interested in action and
adventure than those who want a study in
interpersonal relationships. It features only
two ' b i g ' n a m e s ( A n t h o n y B u r g e s s w h o
i n v e n t e d the s p e c i a l language u s e d a n d
D e s m o n d M o r r i s who created the body
l a n g u a g e ) n e i t h e r of w h o m is u s u a l l y
associated with the film industry. The film is
currently enjoying e n o r m o u s s u c c e s s in
America. Peter Rodgers
Whose Life is it Anyway? (A) John
Badham, 1981. Starring Richard Dreyfuss,
Christine Lahti. 119 mins. Showing: ABC
Fulham Road, ABC Bayswater, Classic
Oxford Street.
This started as a Granada T V play, was then
put on by the Greenwich Fringe, transferred to
the West End, on to Broadway, and now "see
the film".
The action has been transposed to America,
but I presume the original view was supposed
to s u r v i v e . It d o e s n ' t . A n y m e a n i n g f u l
illustration of ethic and all tension generated
by choice is firmly buried beneath the artificial
edifice of sacharrin sentimentality.
Originally the paralysed K e n Harrison was a
bluff sculptor but in this version, and played by
Richard Dreyfuss, he can sketch like Renoir
and sculpt like Rodin. H e has a beautiful ballet
dancer girlfriend, who is treated as a trinket
throughout the film, and he is fawned over by
an equally attractive and bauble-like lady
doctor. From the wonderfully talented surgeon
to the street-wise hospital orderly, caricatures
propagate increasingly pointlessly in this
wilderness. Each character in serving merely
as a t e s t i m o n y to K e n ' s w o n d e r f u l n e s s
becomes an automated void and instead of
defining the nature and limits of the choices
open to him they create a hollowness that
swallows plot and any ensuing moral decision.
If you like films sugary, safe and anaesthe-
tised, singularly devoid of any questioning of
ethic, then you may be able to stand this one. I
think it should have been aborted.
