Dear Mr Smith
W e think our new president
w o u l d greatly i m p r o v e his
image if he had a shave. C a n
we really have a leader with a
beard.

Sir
I a m writing to you today
in disapproval of the criticism
my College is receiving from
the anti-apartheid movement
for allowing South African
mining companies access to
British students for recruit-
ment overseas. It is w e l l -
k n o w n that G r e a t B r i t a i n
relies h e a v i l y u p o n S o u t h
A f r i c a ' f o r i m p o r t a n t r a w
materials. T h e British mining
i n d u s t r y ( n o t a b l y at t h e
R o y a l School of Mines) also
relies upon the South Africans
for their wealth of technical
expertise. In the mining of
minerals, a reason that sends
many of our students abroad
every summer for vacation
training. Whilst one accepts
that t h e s u b j u g a t i o n of a
people based upon colour, is
both cruel and humiliating,
one must realise that this is a
problem born of many years,
and not one having a fast and
s t a b l e p o l i t i c a l s o l u t i o n .
F a c e d w i t h t h e p o s s i b l e
erosion of our own infrastruc-
ture, I feel that Britain, as a
nation, is in no position to
turn her back on South Africa
and that members of anti-
a p a r t h e i d s h o u l d consider
more carefully the possible'
implications of their actions.
T h e position for " l a i s s e z -
faire" has already been stated
in a letter written to you by
M r D . Ashforth, a letter that
left M r E . M . U n g o a l a (a
p h y s i c s P C ) i n a state of
shuddering, mind-boggling,
utter confusion! Really, one
would expect a little more
practical common sense from
students of science at Imperial
College.

Dear Mark
C a n s o m e b o d y f r o m
College Block please tell me
and all other F E L I X readers
why some staircases in South-
side are to be redecorated
over Easter. I'm not talking
about the radiators. M y room
has a new radiator, and is to
be repainted, but must be in
better c o n d i t i o n than any
other College accommoda-
tion. I also ask our sabbaticals
to investigate on our behalf
and also take strong action if
necessary.

Dear Sir
I n a l e c t u r e I w e n t to
recently I discovered that in
C h i n a t h e r e a r e s o m e
15,000,000 people involved in
m o n i t o r i n g a n d c o n t r o l i n g
the major agricultural pests.
Using rapid communication
along an efficient command
network these pests have been
s i g n i f i c a n t l y r e d u c e d i n
numbers.
In the U K agriculture is
more intensive, if however, an
additionall 3,000,000 people
were employed in pest control
it should be possible to treat
each plant by hand, squashing
insect pests a n d u p r o o t i n g
competing weeds, without the
use of potentially dangerous
pesticides fexcept perhaps for
fungi and microbial patho-
g e n s ; a n d w i t h p o s i t i v e
selection lor rare or beneficial
species. Such a system would
clearly be effective lor hot-
house or market garden crops,
but its application to cereals
may be more difficult, because
of the way these arc planted.
In the current economic:
climate there is likely to be
suitable numbers of workers
available, already being paid
by the Government. The use
of t h i s , as y e t , u n t a p p e d
workforce would therefore kill
two b i r d s ( u n e m p l o y m e n t
and pollution from pesticides)
with one stone. T h e profits
coming from increased crop
protection (and irrigation...if
this is needed), and the money
saved on pesticides could be
used to increase the standard
of living of the workforce. T h e
quality of life would also be
i n c r e a s e d by c o n s i d e r a b l e
decentralisation of the popu-
lation (reducing pressure on
d e c a y i n g i n n e r - c i t y areas)
and increasing the health of
the population as a result of
exercise a n d more n a t u r a l
food in the diet.
W e are starting a pilot
scheme on our windowsill,
and I suggest that this is a line
of logistic research which the
government would do well to
follow up.
lours sincerely
