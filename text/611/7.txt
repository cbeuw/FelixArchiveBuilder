Rag
Rag lives on! Last Saturday was the Deaf
Kiddies Party which, unlike a lot of Rag earlier
this year, was a success. There were about
twenty children who had a great time attacking
each other and those who were kind enough to
risk life a n d limb to c o m e a n d help. P a t
K i n g s w e l l , organiser of the N a t i o n a l Deaf
Children's Society was there and brought with
her one of the Radio-Electronic Hearing Aids
which we are buying for them at Â£300 a go.

Even though there's no time for you to buy one
this term, I'd better let you know that the soc
magazine, the almost indescribable N M E 3 has
just been published, 40p to non-members, 30p
to members, and 20p if you've got something
in it. It's even funnier than Morning Cloud,
folks!
We won't have many events next term, as it
is our policy not to provide distractions just
before the exams. The policy does not extend
to not showing The Rocky Horror Picture
Show however, so we will. O u r president
c l a i m s that he will a t t e n d i n g o l d l a m e
swimming trunks, but only time will tell. After
this there will be the A G M where next year's
officers will be elected.
I don't think anything remains to be said
except perhaps that if there are any Larry
Niven fans out there, they might like to know
that Oath of Fealty is out in paperback. I will
now exit singing " H i H o Adric's Dead". Yours
faithfully.

There are still a few tickets remaining for the
Silwood Ball, so contact Simon Moore via the
Union Office for details.
I'm sorry about all the c o c k - u p s with
Spanner and Bolt, but it was all the fault of M r
X , (and myself for trusting him).
The office is nice and tidy at the moment, so
let's try and keep it that way, and perhaps we
can use it for the hive of social activity that is,
even as I write, springing from the heels of next
year's executive.

Rifle & Pistol
As announced last week, the i n t e r - C C U full-
bore competition took place at Bisley over
900yds on Sunday. After initial problems
with transport a full complement of shooters
for each team made their intrepid journey to
the barren wastes of Bisley. As usual rain was
encountered, but the boundless enthusiasm
of Denis Sleath (Club C a p t a i n , contact v i a
M e c h E n g letter-racks) instilled fresh spirit in
team members, who found warm cars a n d
hot coffee more stimulating. After a hesitant
start by a l l teams, R C S took an early lead
and by lunch were three points ahead at
Guilds with Mines already totally out of the
running. M a r k Bourke ( R C S ) shot a 45
before lunch followed closely by Guildsmen
Lindsay, Smith and Hilton who all registered
44 apiece. After a mainly liquid lunch both
teams (not Mines) shot with skill and fervour
with a magnificent 49 from Tony Briers
which clinched the trophy for R C S despite a
brave 47 f r o m G a r y S m i t h for G u i l d s .
F o l l o w i n g the p r i z e p r e s e n t a t i o n (again
liquid!) the teams set off home with Denis
and Steve indecently exposing themselves in
Hammersmith due to the excitement of the
day. Police are looking into the matter. Final
score: Guilds 442; Mines 362; R C S 450.

Careers Advisory Service
Summer Term Job Vacancy Scheme
In view of the difficult employment situation
facing graduates this year it has been decided
to offer a new service for College leavers this
summer. This service is in two parts as follows.
1. Notification of Vacancies
Immediately after Easter the Careers Advisory
Service will be in touch with employers to seek
notification of job vacancies as yet unfilled or
new vacancies which have arisen. The results
of this exercise will be available to students
during the summer term.
2. Register of Students Available for
Employment
From the beginning of the summer term a new
scheme will be introduced through which
students seeking employment can register a
Standard Application Form with the Careers
Advisory Service. Precise details of how the
scheme will operate have yet to be finished but
either employers may be notified of students
seeking e m p l o y m e n t in specific areas o r
students notified of vacancies which match
their requirements.
Details of the scheme will be available next
term.
