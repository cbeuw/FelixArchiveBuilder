Cock and Bull
Twenty-five members of R C S walked a total distance of 150 miles in
the U n i o n Lower Lounge last weekend as part of a 1,000,001-Down
darts race.
At 6:00pm on Friday, Ian Thomas and Jez Moss, the respective
captains of C h e m 1 and C h e m 2 teams threw the first darts in this
marathon R a g stunt. T w o days and three nights later the C h e m 1 team
reached zero with a double seven, followed closely by the C h e m 2 team
who took 89 shots to finish from double three.
Each team threw between seventy and eighty thousand darts (the
exact figures to be revealed soon) weighing a total of around two tons,
at an average of roughly thirteen points per dart.
The players were hindered by armies of cockroaches which invaded
the Lower Lounge at three o'clock each morning and by the cleaners
who, with only a few thousand points to go, attempted to eject
everyone on M o n d a y .
It is expected that a three figure sum has been raised for R C S Rag.
Waldegrave at IC
The conservative M P W i l l i a m
Waldegrave spoke at College last
Tuesday on the invitation of the
Conservative Society.
M r W a l d e r g r a v e is u n d e r
s e c r e t a r y o f s t a t e f o r h i g e r
e d u c a t i o n a n d t o l d the s m a l l
crowd how universities had been
r e c e i v i n g l a r g e r a n d l a r g e r
amounts of their money from the
University Grants Committee. In
the past they had received the
majority of their income from
other sources, but now 95% of
t h e i r m o n e y comes f r o m the
U G C . M r Waldergrave said the
government would like to see this
figure reduced to about 85%.
Election Results
The R o y a l School of Mines U n i o n ratified its executive for next year at
their U G M last Tuesday. The candidate for Honorary Secretary was
the only one unopposed. The officers are: President Nigel Walls: V i c e -
President J o h n Eagleson; H o n Sec M a r k Daniel.
The elections for departmental representatives were also held this
week. Nine new representatives were elected to be ratified at today's
U G M . There were no candidates for the post in C i v E n g and the C h e m
Eng election will have to be re-run because there was no-one to man
the ballot-box in the afternoon. Those elected are: Chemistry G .
O'Shea; C o m p u t i n g P. Donovan; Elec E n g G . Bowser (re-elected):
Geology M . Jones; Life Sci P. Burt; Maths F. Whitelaw; M e c h E n g R.
Tang; M e t & M a t Sci C. Southall; Physics D . Parry. The elections in
Aero E n g and M i n e r a l Resources E n g have still to be held.
Sextet Stun
Southside
Last Saturday was marked by the
f i r s t a p p e a r a n c e o f a L i f e
Sciences Review in the Southside
R e a l A l e Bar.
T h e review, organised by M r
Philip N a t h a n (the Divisional
Representative), consisted of a
series of songs and sketches as
w e l l as a w a r d s for v a r i o u s
achievements within the depart-
ments. These consisted of foam
pies and succeeded in clearing
most of the audience back into
the adjoining bar.
T h e highlight of the evening
was u n d o u b t e d l y the perfor-
mance of a sextet of dancers lead
by Miss Christine Starch of Life
S c i 2. T h e y p e r f o r m e d a re-
markably intimate arrangement
which went down very well with
the a u d i e n c e . T h e E d i t o r of
F E L I X c o m m e n t e d t h a t he
would investigate this story in
greater depth at a later date.
Another
cock-up
T h e inefficiencies of the Bookings
Office were highlighted again
this week when Wellsoc tried to
h o l d t h e i r A n n u a l G e n e r a l
Meeting in the Mines Building
l a s t T u e s d a y . W e l l s o c h a d
confirmed their booking of the
Sutton Lecture Theatre twice
but on the night the security
guard claimed that he hadn't
been informed of the booking. It
was only after M r R . Dickens,
the Security Superintendent, was
contacted that the meeting was
allowed to go ahead, but only
after a crowd of people had been
kept waiting.
C h a i r m a n of W e l l s o c M r
Pallab Ghosh later said " I t isn't
the first time this has happened,
this sort of cock-up happens on a
regular basis. It happened to us
b e f o r e t h i s t e r m w h e n w e ' d
booked M e c h E n g 220 and had
to turn seventy members away."
A secretary from the Bookings
Office said the appropriate paper
work was sent to security every
week and if security didn't read
it, it wasn't the Booking Office's
fault.
M r Nick M o r t o n is currently
t a k i n g t h e m a t t e r u p w i t h
C a p t a i n L i n d l e y , the C o l l e g e
Domestic Secretary.
Cult Corner
At Nightline we occasionally receive calls from people who have friends
or relatives involved with cult groups. Sometimes the callers only want a
few details about the cult while other times they are trying to find
someone and release them from the cult.
Organisations which sometimes crop up in calls include the Unification
Church (Moonies), Krishna Consciousness, Scientology and recently
Exegesis and the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh cult. The last two have
recently been receiving some attention in the national press.
People are well informed about the Moonies and further comment is
not necessary. Exegesis is not a religious cult but more of a
p s y c h o t h e r a p y group. T h e techniques used are long aggressive
encounter sessions which can be quite damaging to peoples personalities
and even affect mental stability. The wallet is also damaged—at around
£150 for a training course!
The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh cult is growing rapidly. It bears the name
of the founder, who saw the light in 1953. He spent the next thirteen
years teaching and developing his faith in India. In 1969 he started a
therapy centre in Bombay and the first non-Indians were admitted a year
later. During the seventies the cult spread to the West and now has
sixteen centres and 2,000 disciples in the U K alone.
Disciples are given a new name when they join. They have to wear
orange and red clothes (fully or partially), a picture of their master and
108 sandalwood beads. The cult also moves it disciples between centres
and countries. People who attend the newcomers evenings at the Chalk
Farm Centre (cost 50p) are rarely aware of the power in the meditation
techniques. M o r e advanced members indulge in induced hysteria
sessions as well as r e l a x a t i o n , d a n c i n g a n d c o n t r o l l e d breathing
exercises. Free sexual expression is also important in the therapy.
Like the Moonies, people do get lost in this organisation. The therapy,
especially if insulated from outside influences, can lead to 'brainwashing'
(perhaps a function of personaly strength?). The dangers are two-fold.
First is the upheaval caused to family and friends when a disciple rejects
them or disappears. Secondly is the psychological damaged suffered by
the disciple when the group rejects them. The disciple will be totally
dependent on the group for emotional and physical support. Rejection
coupled with dumping in a strange city (or country) with no money or
possessions is a good ticket to a psychiatric hospital.
For the last decade the Indian government has been reluctant to grant
visas to Westerners visiting the cult's headquarters. Recently the cult
have spent £3m on a lOOsq mile ranch in Oregon U S A and are building an
entire town as a cult centre. They have also set up a commune in Suffolk
complete with a school for disciples' children.
Of course, not all fringe religious cult groups are so bad. However, the
next time you drop lOp in a Moonie (etc.) collecting tin it might be worth
considering exactly what you are financing.
