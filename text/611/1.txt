GAME OVER FOR PINBALL WIZARD.
Mr Barney McCabe has resignedfrom his position as ICU Deputy
President following a motion of no confidence at last Monday's
ICU Council meeting.
T h e start of the meeting was delayed by over twenty minutes as
there were not enough Council members present to form a quorum.
U n d e r the D e p u t y P r e s i d e n t ' s business there was an extensive
discussion about the pinball and video machines in the U n i o n Lower
Lounge. Last year the U n i o n earned considerable revenue from these
machines but so far this session they have lost ,£2,000. The D P was
criticised for his handling of the situation; in particular, that he did not
realise the seriousness of the problem and take action earlier.
Mr Philip Nathan, Life Sciences Dep Rep, then proposed a motion
of no confidence in the D P . In his proposal speech he outlined how he
considered that Barney had not done his job in a satisfactory manner.
An amendment to the motion (proposed by Chris Webb) to further
instruct the C h a i r m a n of Council (Nick Morton) to take the motion of
no confidence to the next U G M was accepted.
Phil Greenstreet (DP-elect) then spoke against the motion. He
pointed out areas where he thought the D P had achieved something,
but on a secret vote the motion of no confidence was carried. The
voting was 14 for; 7 against; and. 2 abstentions.
After the result had been announced, M r M c C a b e concluded his
report bv tendering his resignation and leaving the meeting. H e also
handed M a r c o L e d w o l d a letter confirming that his resignation would
take effect from Friday. A p r i l 2.
At this point C o u n c i l became inquorate and the meeting was closed.
There was, however, some discussion over whether the motion of no
confidence should be taken to the U G M . Eventually Chris W e b b
agreed to speak to such a motion instead of Nick M o r t o n .
After the meeting Barney stated that he had not resigned from his
post as Editor of The Phoenix and intended to continue production of
the magazine.
R o c k on T o m m y
It was not until early last week that the loss of money from the games
m a c h i n e was n o t i c e d . A f t e r M r N i c k M o r t o n , I C U P r e s i d e n t ,
requested an estimate for next
y e a r ' s i n c o m e f r o m g a m e s
machines it was discovered that
expenditure on rental exceeded
income by approx ^2,000.
The reasons for the situation
are not clear; a series of thefts
over the summer and a fall-off in
useage may account for some
loss, but it was estimated that
over ,£2,000 profit should have
been made by the end of this
year. It was suggested at I C U
C o u n c i l that the Deputy Presi-
dent should have noticed the loss
earlier and taken appropriate
action.
Mascots Returned
A c r o w d of over fifty people g a t h e r e d in Beit Q u a d r a n g l e on
Wednesday lunchtime to witness the return of Spanner and Bolt.
The violated mascot of City and Guilds U n i o n had been in the
possession of the R o y a l College of Science U n i o n since February 4 and
were originally to be returned last Thursday.
City and Guilds U n i o n had performed a series of tasks in order to
secure the return of the mascots. These included sending Valentine's to
the R C S U Executive, cleaning shoes, selling pancakes and even
accompanying R C S U mascotry on a raid to Kings College. Besides
this, C & G U President A n d y Rushton raised money by a sponsored
alcohol-free period and other members of Guilds knitted a scarf.
The total raised for R C S U R a g is believed to be in excess ol £330.
