Dead Patriotic
f"Hcre is an odd item, Professor," I said,
•looking up from my newspaper. "It says here
(that three of the first five presidents of United
States died on the Fourth of July. I wonder
what the odds are against a coincidence like
that."
"I'm not sure," replied the professor, "but
I'm willing to give ten-to-one odds 1 can name
one of the three who died on that date."
Assuming that the professor had no prior
knowledge of the dates on which any of the
presidents died, was he justified in offering
such odds?

Preamble
At the time of writing I have received fifty-four
correct solutions to last week's puzzle, but just
in case there's anyone left in College who
hasn't been able to do it, take your crumpled
piece of paper and follow these instructions:
Fold the right half of the paper onto the left
half, so that 4 lies on top of 1.
Fold the bottom half up, so that 8 goes on 4.
Tuck 8 and 4 (together) between 6 and 7.
Fold 1 and 5 onto 6.
Yes, it was quite easy; I intended it to be
easy since so many puzzles have been difficult
lately. But since it is the end of term, my
priority was to set something which would be
fun to solve; judging from your comments I
succeeded here too. Moral: if you come across
any 'fun' puzzles like this, especially if they're
not well-known, send them to me and I'll be
happy to publish them.
The deadline for last week's puzzle hadn't
been reached at the time of going to press, so
the winner will have to wait till next term.
The Easter puzzle page, as usual, has a
mixture of sworded puzzles which carry a
prize of £5 each, and unmarked puzzles which
are just for fun. Mend-a-Bike of Park Walk,
Chelsea, have generously donated the prize
money as usual, but to anyone not lucky
enough to win, they are still offering discounts
to FELIX readers.
Good luck, happy Easter, don't work too
hard
