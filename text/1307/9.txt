The US election has been run and
won. There’s been plenty of analy-
sis on this result, but what of the
nations that have been supporting
Bush’s war on terror?
Surrounding the US elections are
democratic events in the two coun-
tries that have supported the US
most strongly since 9/11. Australia
went to the polls in early October
this year, and the British general
election is hotly tipped to take place
within the next six months.
While Australia voted in the con-
text of a then undecided America,
Britain’s electorate will vote on Tony
Blair in light of a Bush victory. How
much influence is exerted by the US
polls in these two countries? What
balance of domestic to foreign policy
was struck in Australia, and what
balance will be found in Britain?
Does the US and the war on terror
exert any real influence at all in
these two countries?
AUSTRALIA
By Duncan Pearse
Do you remember those posters the
anti-war crowd put up following the
Spanish elections in March? They
listed the three names “Aznar, Bush,
Blair”. Aznar was crossed out to sig-
nify the ‘no Iraq war’ vote that had
just swept the Spanish President
from office.
As we now know, the poster mak-
ers have not had the chance to cross
off George W Bush’s name from
that list. It’s also a good thing for
them they didn’t list the name of
John Howard, the Australian Prime
Minister. Like Aznar and Blair, he’s
been a big supporter of the war on
terror since 9/11, and sent troops to
Iraq, but in the Australian elections
which were held on 9 October he
won a historic fourth term of office
with a swing to his conservative
coalition government.
Before I go on, I must declare
an interest here – I am a member
John Howard’s Liberal Party, and
have worked for them in the past in
Australia.
For the uninitiated, Australian
democracy is based upon the
Westminster system, with national
government terms lasting three
years. The parliament consists of a
lower house with 150 seats, and a
directly elected upper house with 76
Senators.
In the 9 October elections, the
Howard government (a coalition
between the Liberal and National
parties) was asking the people for
a fourth term in office since send-
ing the Labor party to opposition in
1996. At a time when a government
is normally regarded as tired and
stale, the people gave the Liberal
Party a 3% increase in its primary
vote, with the coalition enjoying a
1.8% swing on a two-party preferred
basis. The coalition’s majority in the
lower house increased from 14 seats
to 24 seats. Many Coalition seats
that were once marginal now sud-
denly enjoy a buffer of 5% or more.
Simultaneously, the Labor Party’s
primary vote continued its long-term
slide, losing five seats. Crucially as
well, the Government won a major-
ity in the Senate – the first time a
government has achieved this in
around twenty years. This result
was not a landslide, but it was in the
ballpark.
Before the election, the ‘peace’
crowd were licking their chops, just
waiting to see yet another of Bush’s
international allies bite the dust over
Iraq as Aznar had done earlier.
Post election, the malcontents’
line was that the only reason for the
government’s return was that Iraq
hardly featured in the election cam-
paign. This is supposed to explain
why the electorate didn’t give the
PM the whipping they’d been gag-
ging to deliver for three years now.
True enough, there was plenty of
focus on domestic policies during
the campaign: a government scare
campaign on interest rates, the sig-
nificance of which was overplayed
by Labor after they lost; a disgrace-
ful attempt at voter bribery by the
government with a $13bn budget
surplus spending spree, which
backfired as the public rightly saw
this spending as irresponsible; and
finally, Labor’s deal to snag Green
preferences in return for saving old
growth forests, resulting in logging
workers feeling betrayed by Labor
yet again and voting conservative.
All of this – especially the Green
issue – was very important to the
government’s win, but none of it
meant that Iraq and the war on ter-
ror were irrelevant to the voters. If
the public were as furious about our
involvement in the war on terror as
the anti-war crowd claim, then they
wouldn’t simply forget that anger
because of some domestic issues
arising during a six-week election
campaign.
Given that Australia does have
troops in Iraq – and that their pres-
ence is physically small but politi-
cally important for President Bush
– it was surprising to see during the
campaign that the war as an issue
was notable only by its absence. As
I have mentioned, those lamenting
Labor’s defeat claimed this was the
only reason Howard had won.
Really? And what if Howard had
lost? I have no doubt that the ‘peace’
crowd would have seen it as a pun-
ishment of Howard for going into
Iraq, despite its absence from the
campaign as an election issue. You
can’t have it both ways, folks.
I’m more inclined to believe that
Iraq was not an election issue
because the debate on the war on
terrorandnationalsecurityhadbeen
run and won by the Government a
long while ago. There is a strong
argument to say that campaigns
themselves don’t actually influence
many votes at all – what matters
are the impressions formed by vot-
ers over the years leading up to the
election.
Against this background, it is rea-
sonabletoarguethatvotersapproved
of the Government’s backing of the
war on terror – Afghanistan, Iraq
and all.
John Howard openly supported
Bush’s war on terror, and still does.
Just about every issue that sur-
rounded the Iraq war here in the
UK was replicated in Australia – no
WMDs, intelligence failures, enquir-
ies into intelligence failures, accusa-
tions that the Government had lied
about the reasons for going to war,
and so on. Australia’s involvement
in Iraq took place under the full
glare of public protest and criticism,
so there was every chance for the
Government to look bad over the
whole affair, and every chance for
voters to punish it at the ballot box.
Sure, Australia had thousands of
people marching against the war
on the same weekend as a million
or two protested in London. But
what the anti-war crowd have never
grasped is that that says nothing
about the people who didn’t go to
protest. Maybe they agreed with the
protesters. But maybe they didn’t
– and after the election we’ve seen
in Australia, it appears to me that a
lot of people who stayed home actu-
ally didn’t agree with the ‘no war at
all costs’ line, while those who did
hit the streets were probably not
going to vote for someone like John
Howard anyway.
Earlier this year, Labor leader
Mark Latham sat down to a radio
interview and ‘announced’ that
Labor’s policy was to bring the
Aussie troops home from Iraq by
Christmas. Then there came the
questions – would that be all of the
troops in the area, or just the ones
actually on the ground in Iraq?
What about the fact that many of
these troops were there to pro-
tect Australian aid workers in the
region? With the passage of time
more and more of Latham’s front-
benchers struggled to answer these
questions.
Also very telling were the disap-
pointing results for the Greens and
the other left-of-centre minor par-
ties. This went very heavily against
the pattern of Australian voting.
Usually, the punters like to take out
insurance – especially when elect-
ing a conservative government. If
someone like Howard is going to be
their Prime Minister, then the vot-
ers will usually give the upper house
the balance of power to a minor
party just to keep the Government
in check.
The results were disappointing for
the Greens, whose quasi-religious
worship of the environment goes
hand-in-hand with their opposition
to war. Their primary vote did rise
from 5% to 7%, but they did not win
a lower house seat, nor did they gain
the Senate balance of power as they
had hoped. If the voters wanted to
temper Howard’s support for the
war on terror with increased Green
presence in the Senate, they had
their chance. Instead, they gave a
Senate majority to the Howard gov-
ernment.
In a nutshell, the voters didn’t
want to be bribed with big election
spending, they didn’t want ‘troops
home by Christmas’ gimmicks, and
they didn’t want any power to go to
the anti-war minor parties. Against
that background, it’s no wonder that
Labor did not buy a single TV adver-
tisement slot to campaign against
the Iraq war. They knew the game
was up long ago in this debate. In
short, the Australian public support
the war on terror and their alliance
with the US – and have done for
some time now.
GREAT BRITAIN
By Barry Edmonstone
Having seen the electoral fortunes of
two distinctly pro-war anglophiles,
we must now look forward to the
British elections in May. Tony Blair
and the Labour party will be defend-
ing a majority of 159 seats, which
in a 659 seat Parliament is a large
margin to play with, especially given
the nature of the core constituen-
cies that Labour hold. The Labour
party has, however, been criticized,
much like Howard and Bush, for its
policies both at home and abroad.
Since the beginning of this
Parliament, the Labour government
has forced through a number of con-
tentious issues. These have covered
a broad spectrum from foundation
hospitals, through university top-up
fees, to anti-terrorism legislation,
regional assemblies and now the
hunting bill. These issues have all
led to protests, the likes of which
have not been seen since the late
1980s. Not only that, but each of
these issues has managed to anger
a different section of society – from
young to old, from rich to poor and
from north to south, no-one has
been left untouched.
On the international stage, things
are not much better – Afghanistan,
Iraq and the EU debates have
not been vote-winners either.
Afghanistan and Iraq have been
seen as reckless wars in support of
an overly aggressive superpower.
Although the charge of being led
to war by others is overly critical,
British troops are yet again dying in
foreign field. This is something that
we should all stop to remember this
week. From a constructive position,
the issues over the next few months
will be creating a lasting peace and
extracting our troops in a safe man-
ner. However, many feel that this is a
task beyond the powers and abilities
of our government.
The EU has played a secondary
role due to the crisis in Iraq, but the
view of most to Brits again seems to
be out of step with the Government.
In the European elections, the
outlook for Labour was decidedly
gloomy. In the last nationwide test
of public opinion before the gen-
eral election, Labour were soundly
beaten by the Conservative party,
27 MEPs to 19. Not only that, but
the UK Independence Party (UKIP),
a marginal party at best, polled a
massive 16% of the vote, only 6%
behind Labour and forcing the
Liberal Democrats into fourth place.
This should have sounded a warning
bell about a rise of parties on the
right of the political spectrum. Yet
no change in the Labour position
seems to have been forthcoming.
It is surprising then to see that
the Government still has so much
support, even when most of these
issues go against the grain of the
public at large as well as against the
beliefs of the ‘traditional’ Labour
voter.
In May, Tony Blair is expected to
win his third term of office with a
comfortable majority of between 30
and 75 seats. This view seems to
have been strengthened given the
Bush victory and the recent result
from Australia.
The question remains: how can
such a range of unpopular deci-
sions lead to another parliamentary
majority? Well first we have to con-
sider the strength of the opposition.
The Conservative party should be
the main challengers in this elec-
tion, but they are a party in disarray.
They lack confidence, ability and
a proven winner. At the end of the
day, Michael Howard will always be
remembered as a loser who went
down with the Major government.
So we look further afield to the
Liberal Democrats, the up and com-
ing political party with the popular
view of the war in Iraq, and the
choice of the young professional.
Well, that’s how they would like to
be seen, but it’s not really the case.
Although they will make the larg-
est gains at the next election, and
could possibly become the official
opposition, they will not make the
gains they require to affect Labour’s
majority. The minor parties may
pick up seats here and there, but
the lack of cohesion in all of these
organisations will undoubtedly be
their downfall.
However, the most important fac-
tor will be the voices of the vot-
ers we have yet to hear. These are
not the protesters or the politically
motivated, but the silent majority
who have had enough of pander-
ing to the most vocal minorities.
This group has been the deciding
factors in both the Australian and
American elections and they are
cautious centre-right voters. This is
a much-maligned group, especially
in Britain, but we will certainly hear
their voice at the next election. They
voted for Blair in 1997 and have sup-
ported him since. They are unhappy,
but they have not abandoned the
Labour party just yet.
The Australians and Americans
have decided. It will be our choice
in less than six months, and the only
way to change things that you don’t
agree with is to go out and vote.
