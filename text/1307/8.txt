Some things never change... but can they?

One of the news stories in this
week’s Felix is that the speaker van
is back. Ever since my first year in
1999 (when dinosaurs roamed the
Earth), the presence of dodgy white
vans purporting to sell music speak-
er systems has hit the news pages of
Felix every November. There’s not
really much that the police, or any-
one, have been able to do recently.
All we can do is ensure that students
are aware of the dangers – which
Felix is doing.
There’s something else that
doesn’t seem to change on the news
pages this week – but which osten-
sibly can: departments timetabling
lectures when they shouldn’t.
Two years ago, my predecessor
took a proposal to the Senate (the
College’s academic governing body)
requesting that Freshers Week be
extended to become a full week
(those of you who are not first years
will remember that teaching has
traditionally started on the first
Wednesday of the autumn term).
The Senate had a ‘lively discus-
sion’ and failed to agree on anything
other than that the issue should be
looked at.
Last year, my first as Union
President, I successfully persuad-
ed the Senate to only allow non-
assessed induction lessons in the
first week – and then only from
Wednesday so as to give a bit more
breathing space – and to make
the Freshers Fair a full day event.
Even then it took the third attempt,
and much preparatory work with
the Academic Registrar, to get it
through. Of course, the academics
complained and some departments
(notably undergraduate medicine)
didn’t quite follow the rules, as they
were traumatised by the prospect
of having to redo their timetables.
Nevertheless, the principle was uni-
versally accepted and appropriate
timetabling changes are being made
for next year to make it universal
across College.
Some 20 years ago, the Union
President of the day successfully
lobbied the Senate to keep lunch-
times free. Under College policy,
there should be no teaching between
12 noon and 2pm on any weekday.
And there should be no teaching
after 12.30pm on Wednesdays (the
extra 30 minutes being to allow for
finishing labs etc).
Why did the Senate set aside this
time? Because university is about
more than just studying for your
degree – lunchtimes and Wednesday
afternoons are set aside to pursue
those other activities. So you’ve
go no excuse not to participate in
the diverse pursuits offered by the
Union’s clubs and societies.
Lunchtimes are not only used by
the Union but also by the humanities
programme. At Imperial, everyone
can study a humanities course or
learn a language. Uniquely amongst
science teaching universities, under-
graduates here have a rich ‘for cred-
it’ humanities programme they can
engage in to broaden their learning.
Sure we all came here to do ‘proper’
degrees, but a little social science
every now and then is good for the
soul. Visit www.hu.ic.ac.uk to find
out what’s on offer.
So why do some departments still
schedule teaching at lunchtimes
or Wednesday afternoons? Mainly
because they haven’t been told off as
no students have complained. And
that’s why it’s important that you do.
There are plenty of ways to improve
life at College (the Union’s strategic
review and QAA audit survey being
examples), but at the end of the day
we can only do our job if you actively
tell us what affects you, rather than
just assuming that we know.

Survey
For those of you who haven’t filled
out the survey at www.union.ic.ac.
uk/survey yet – why not? There are
only a few days left to fill out the
online student survey for planning
the Union’s future.
You’ll have received an email from
the about this on Tuesday, explain-
ing that the Union is undergoing
a Strategic Review – the biggest
review ever undertaken of what the
Union offers and how it can develop
in the years ahead, ensuring that
your Union offers the best service
to you.
You have a real chance to
shape the future of the Union
The Union is entering a huge
period of review to ensure that we
know what our members want.
In the past we have invested in
certain areas, but have never had
an overall plan of where we are
going and how we can improve
and develop for the good of our
members.
Not to be taken lightly
So yes, it might be a hassle to fill
out the survey, but this is an excel-
lent opportunity. It is not a small
scale scheme – we’re dedicating a
lot of time and energy into making
sure your voice is heard. It’s a very
serious issue and we need your hon-
est answers. So do have your say
and contribute to the future of your
Union.
Clubs and societies
Each Chair/President of a club or
society has been sent a Clubs &
Societies questionnaire. Please
return these as soon as possible and
consult your committees and mem-
bers so that we can get as much
information as possible to improve
this large area of the Union’s activi-
ties.
Bribery
And if that’s not enough, then we’ll
resort to bribery – all students who
complete the online survey will be
put into a draw to receive a number
of prizes. These include a Sony
Playstation, travel vouchers from
STA Travel, a meal for two at Moti
Mahal restaurant and some beer.
Imperial College Union is here for
you, but this can only work if you’re
there for us.
And finally
You’ll notice towards the end of
the survey there are questions
relating to QAA (Quality Assurance
Agency). The Union is writing a
statement on behalf of our students
to go the QAA and this is an impor-
tant part of their audit of Imperial
College. This is a process that the
College is taking seriously, so to
allow us to represent your views,
complete the survey. Visit www.
union.ic.ac.uk/survey.
