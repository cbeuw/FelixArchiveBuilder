“What makes the drama is
the great swirling mass of
frantic fish and the power
of the charging sharks...
this also creates the beauti-
ful dynamic lines of move-
ment and contrast of light
and shade, silver and blue...
To get such a shot requires
great skill, knowledge and
experience, together with the
final, vital ingredient: art-
istry.” Rosamund Kidman-
Cox, judge.
Doug Perrine’s spectacu-
lar photograph of two bronze
whaler sharks in a feeding
frenzy won him this year’s
BBC Wildlife Photographer
of the Year Award. Of the
18,500 photographs entered
for the 2004 competition, his
was deemed the most strik-
ing and memorable by the
judges, and scooped the most
prestigious award in wildlife
photography.
The photograph was taken
off the east coast of South
Africa, on the Transkei ‘Wild
Coast’ during the annual sar-
dine run. Initially herded to
the surface by a pod of dol-
phins, this baitball of sardines
came under attack from gan-
nets, tuna and sharks. Perrine
was in the right place at the
right time to get the shot, but
admitted he was bumped by
the 3.5m long sharks in the
process.
He told Felix: “It was poten-
tially dangerous – you have
to think about the situation
in advance and have strate-
gies for the various things
that could happen. The year
before I took that picture,
another photographer was
badly bitten by a feeding
shark and nearly lost his arm.
It was an accident, not really
the shark’s fault, but not a
good situation in a remote
site... He was very, very lucky
to pull through.”
Perrine’s photograph, along
with other images from this
year’s competition, is cur-
rently on display in an exhi-
bition at the Natural History
Museum, near Imperial’s
South Kensington campus.
As with previous years, the
standard of photography is
outstanding, and the exhibi-
tion contains all the category
winning images, runners-up
andcommendedphotographs.
In total, 60 images have been
enlarged and lit up, and will
be on display until February,
when they will begin a tour
of the UK.
This year’s competition has
a real underwater feel to it
and unlike other years, there
are more sharks than big cats
on display in the exhibition.
Doug Perrine has a second
photograph on display – again
a bronze whaler feeding on
a baitball. The innovation
award went to Pete Atkinson
with a clever photo of a grey
reef shark just below the sur-
face of the water, and a great
white shark shot is highly
commended in the portrait
category. Yet the exhibition
has something for everyone –
whether it is sharks, chimps,
snakes, fungi, flowers, spec-
tacular landscapes or the
Northern lights, the range of
images is possibly the most
diverse in the competition’s
recent history.
In the gallery itself, visitors
to the exhibition are treated
to atmospheric sounds that
play while you view the pho-
tographs. Unfortunately,
these don’t quite work – you
have to be lucky to be look-
ing at a photograph to the
appropriate sounds as they
continually change to evoke
different environments. Most
of the time, the sounds do
not match with what you are
looking at. For example, you
could be absorbing yourself
in an underwater photo to
the sounds of bubbles, only
to be wrenched out of it by
the screeching of (presum-
ably) the golden leaf mon-
key on the other side of the
exhibition. By the time you’ve
reached the monkey portrait,
the sound loop is back around
to the bubbles again. Yet the
beauty of the photographs
dominates this exhibition,
and the presentation of the
lit up images in a dark gal-
lery enables visitors to fully
appreciate how spectacular
they are.
The BBC Wildlife
Photographer of the Year
Award continues to attract
the biggest names in wildlife
photography from around the
globe, and previous winners
in the competition include
Frans Lanting, Thomas
Mangelsen, and Anup Shah.
Anup Shah is represented
by four images in this year’s
exhibition, and he won the
animal behaviour category
for an image of a golden jack-
al chasing flamingos. This
award goes to the best image
of a mammal actively doing
something, and is judged on
interest value as well as aes-
thetic appeal. The picture bril-
liantly captures a chase, and
the jackal is nicely framed
by surrounding flamingos.
With ears pinned back and
shoulders hunched, there is
definitely something of Wile
E Coyote about the scraggly
subject as it splashes across
the lake.
Shah had a successful
academic career in conser-
vation with many journal
publications, but abandoned
academia to pursue wildlife
photography. He passionately
believes wildlife photography
has conservation value, and
explained to Felix: “Academic
writing appeals to the rational
side of humans whereas wild-
life photography appeals to
the emotional side. Once you
get people by their hearts,
you can win them over more
easily.”
Spectacular images of ani-
mals in their environment
have the power to generate
an interest in wildlife and its
preservation, perhaps having
a greater impact for conser-
vation than academic papers
that are hidden in journals.
Perrine hopes his photo will
generate interest in the con-
servation of bronze whalers.
These impressive sharks are
in decline, yet they are still
hunted for ‘sport’ on deep-sea
fishing trips around the coast
of southern Africa. Based in
Hawaii, Perrine is known as
one of the world’s foremost
marine wildlife photogra-
phers. His underwater career
has spanned dive instructor,
marine biologist and pho-
tojournalist for National
Geographic.
He told Felix that he enters
this competition “to win some
recognition, hoping to get a
little prize money and some
publishing contracts”. The
prestige of the award will
ensure that the world’s top
photographers continue to
enter this yearly competition.
The 2005 competition is
underway and the organis-
ers are keen to encourage as
many people as possible to
enter before the April dead-
line. You do not have to be
a professional photographer
to enter – amateurs have
scooped awards throughout
the history of the competi-
tion. As a professional, Doug
Perrine has entered in pre-
vious years without success.
His advice for the rest of us?
“Don’t give up. Persistence
wins the game.”
This exhibition in the
Natural History Museum is
free to students of Imperial
College (it would normally be
£5), so there’s no excuse for
not visiting.

“The competition has
something for everyone
whether it is sharks,
chimps, snakes, fungi,

Walk like Jesus: Anup Shah’s image of a golden jackal won him the award in the animal behaviour category
“Academic writing
appeals to the rational
side of humans
whereas wildlife
photography appeals to
the emotional side”
