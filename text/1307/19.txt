There are myriads of productions
gracing London’s stages. There’s
a bit of everything: comedy, musi-
cals, drama, dance, opera and more.
However, in my opinion, one produc-
tion stands out at the moment: the
Royal Ballet’s revived Sylvia. You
will be hard pressed to find anything
more gloriously enchanting on any
stage.
This year is the centenary of the
Royal Ballet’s founding choreog-
rapher, Sir Frederick Ashton, and
in celebration a large selection of
Ashton ballets form the core of the
Royal Ballet’s season.
You may find it surprising, I know
I did, but ballet is really something
of a ‘new art’ to Britain. The first
two permanent companies were set
up during Ashton’s lifetime, 1904-
88, including what has become the
Royal Ballet. Sir Frederick had a
hand in setting up both of these
early companies.
Having started his ballet training
in secret, Ashton rose to promi-
nence as a dancer, but most notably
as a choreographer. He was prolific,
but did not like to have his work
documented, something he was to
regret in later life as it became clear
to him that this would somewhat
impede his works’ chances of sur-
vival after his own demise. Many of
his ballets have remained in the rep-
ertoire from their premiers, such
as Cinderella (score by Prokofiev)
and La Fille Mal Gardée (music
by Hérold but “freely adapted and
arranged” by John Lanchbery),
but some such as Sylvia have been
very nearly or entirely lost. This has
made the revival of Sylvia all the
more triumphant.
Lovingly recreated from sketches,
archive materials and the memories
of dancers who performed the roles
during Ashton’s lifetime, Sylvia is a
truly spectacular achievement. The
role of Sylvia, and so the entire bal-
let, was created for Margot Fonteyn,
the most talented and sparkling
dancer of the age who was also hon-
oured by the Royal Ballet with the
title of “Prima Ballerina Assoluta”,
in the fifties.
The score for the ballet is by Léo
Delibes, of Lakmé fame (the Flower
Duet hijacked by British Airways
is from this opera), and includes
at least one piece that most will
recognise: the Pizzicato, which inci-
dentally is also the music to which
Sylvia’s showpiece dance is set.
Sylvia’s plot is simple and clas-
sic. The hero, Aminta, a shepherd,
falls in love with the unattainable
Sylvia. Sylvia, one of the goddess
Diana’s huntresses, does not return
Aminta’s affections and shoots him.
Miraculously, the god Eros saves
Aminta and also makes Sylvia fall
madly in love with him. However,
Sylvia is also admired by Orion, and
in her besotted state is then abduct-
ed by him. As we all know, Aminta’s
love must triumph so Sylvia is able
to escape Orion with the help of
Eros and be reunited with her ‘true’
love. However, a final hurdle to hap-
piness exists, Diana, who doesn’t
condone such liaisons and so must
be won over.
Three pairs of dancers take the
principal roles of Sylvia and Aminta,
and the role of Orion is also rotat-
ed – ballet is, after all, a beautiful
but hugely physically demanding
art form. The three trios are as
follows: Darcey Bussell, Jonathan
Cope, Thiago Soares; Zenaida
Yanowsky, David Makhateli, Gary
Avis; Marianela Nunez, Rupert
Pennefather, Viacheslav Samodurov.
While Darcey Bussell is undoubt-
edly the most recognisable name in
the list, the cast that has received
most critical acclaim has been that
lead by Marianela Nunez. However,
no cast has gone without praise.
I had the pleasure of seeing the
ballet, quite recently, with Darcey
Bussell as Sylvia. Yes, she was a
little tall, and at times (particularly
in the final Act, if I am to believe
the gentlemen sitting next to us)
rescued from near catastrophe by
Jonathan Cope (Aminta), but none
of this took away from a thoroughly
enjoyable performance. To be per-
fectly honest I didn’t notice the near
catastrophes and I’m sure that out-
side of the very knowledgeable sec-
tion of the audience few will have
done so either – we were all to
busy being swept away by the sheer
beauty of the entire company’s per-
formance.
Not only is the production visually
striking as a result of the dancers
and the choreography, the costumes
and the scenery are also stunning.
The costumes and scenery have
been reproduced to be faithful to the
original production and so have a
beautiful feel of fifties elegance and
grace about them. The colours are
wonderful and the costumes, whose
details have all been hand painted,
as delicate as can be.
Sylvia runs until 3 December. If
you can at all get tickets then do so,
you will not be disappointed. If you
cannot manage to see Sylvia then
there are many more Ashton ballets
to be savoured this season. Check
the Royal Opera House’s website,
www.roh.org.uk, for details and cast
lists. One should really not pass
up such an opportunity to discover,
rediscover, or continue to enjoy the
ballet, or indeed to see the likes of
Darcey Bussell and Carlos Acosta,
who is only with the Royal Ballet as
a visiting principal, dance.

The legacy of Frederick Ashton
The Royal Ballet pays glorious tribute to its Founder Choreographer on his centenary
The newest exhibition at the
National Gallery is the latest of the
Art in the Making series, and inves-
tigates the inner workings of the
artist Edgar Degas (1834-1917).
Degas was, as well as being a
major developer of art in the 19th
and early 20th centuries, the first
modern artist whose works were
bought by the National Gallery, in
1918.
The exhibition compromises 26
works, both fully completed and
studies, and probes into the meth-
ods employed by Degas in creating
his art. Degas used more conven-
tional methods than many of his
contemporaries for preparing his
pieces. He would produce many
technical studies before starting his
final piece using linear composition
and monochromatic layers, and only
then adding the layers of colour.
The exhibition analyses closely
several works, most interestingly
The Young Spartans and Miss La
La at the Cirque Fernando. The
presentation of the former includes
a full-scale study made around
1860 and an X-ray of the final piece
showing significant changes made
to it stretching over 10 or even 20
years. Such insight into the mind
of the artist is extraordinarily rare;
you can see how he changed his
mind about the composition of the
piece, the positions of the figures,
and even the changing of the faces
from those of classical figures to
more playful faces of Parisian street
urchins.
MissLaLaattheCirqueFernando
is a striking picture of a famous per-
former of Degas’s time swinging by
her teeth. The development of this
painting includes several studies
of the figure herself, and one of the
complex architectural backdrop of
the piece. Indeed, examination of
the piece suggests that Degas had
great difficulty with this aspect, and
in the end employed an architec-
tural draftsman to help him get it
right.
The exhibition also includes a
video that better explains Degas’s
methods, including his use of tracing
paper to create the series Russian
Dancers, his essence painting and
his use of monotype, a method he
practically invented. Insights into
his famous waxwork modelling,
which he turned to towards the end
of his life as his eyesight became
increasingly worse, are also given,
and the exhibition includes the
model Dancer Looking at the Sole
of her Right Foot.
This exhibition allows so much
insight into the workings of Degas,
it almost seems like it is decon-
structing a genius. However, when
you think of the methods he invent-
ed, the complexity of his prepara-
tion and the attention he paid to
every detail of his works, it’s impos-
sible not to walk away in awe of this
master.
