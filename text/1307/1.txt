Students in a number of
College departments are hav-
ing to attend lectures and
tutorials at times suppos-
edly reserved for humanities
classes and lunch breaks.
According to the Imperial
Collegewebsite,“onMondays,
Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Fridays in the autumn and
spring terms there is a two-
hour break at midday for
the lunch-hour Humanities
Programme”.
However, some students
have regular lectures, tutori-
als or labs between noon and
2pm. In the worst cases, first
year students attend lectures
and classes continuously
from 10am until 6pm.
First year aeronautics stu-
dents have lectures from
10am until noon and 2pm
until 6pm on Tuesdays, with
two hours of mathematics in
between. The mathematics
is officially ‘optional’, though
it is strongly recommended
and, according to one student,
“essential if you didn’t do fur-
ther maths [at A-level]”.
The student, who wished to
remain anonymous for fear
of his department’s reac-
tion, added: “I’ve only just
moved to London and started
university, and this is just
too much”.
Andrew Sykes, a third year
chemistry student, has lec-
tures all morning on most
days, followed by a lab session
from midday until 5pm. He
told Felix: “It’s silly, and it’s
running me into the ground.
The official line is that you
don’t have to be in labs all
the time, but you do – it’s an
unwritten rule”.
First years studying elec-
trical engineering and infor-
mation systems engineering
have a range of lectures at
noon on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Fridays.
Meanwhile, some students
in the chemical engineering
and mechanical engineering
departments have regular
lectures or tutorials between
noon and 2pm.
Professor Rees Rawlings,
theProRectorforEducational
Quality, told Felix that he
was disappointed to hear
about the issue, continuing:
“The situation is quite clear.
Certain times of day should
be kept free for these activi-
ties. By now, all departments
should be aware of this and
timetable their activities
accordingly.”
Prof Rawlings stressed the
importance of allowing stu-
dents to follow humanities
and language courses, and
said that when informed of
problems like this he would
always follow them up with
the departments concerned.
Sam Rorke, Deputy
President (Education and
Welfare) of Imperial College
Union, said that leaving the
period between noon and
2pm free is “a very sensi-
ble College policy” and that
he would be “working with
departmental representa-
tives to ensure that this rule
is upheld”.
