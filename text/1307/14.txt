This is the last time this term
that my words will grace these
pages. I am going to use this
article to advertise our final
major event of the term, the
one that needs as many of you
as possible to join in. It will be
fun, I promise you, as previ-
ous participants will testify.
On Saturday we are raid-
ing London on behalf of The
Mercury Phoenix AIDS Trust,
who are one of our main char-
ities for this year. For those
unfamiliar with the concept of
a ‘raid’, it is as follows:
1. Get a group of friends
together and sign in at the
Union from 11am onwards,
2. Go out into London with
collecting tins and a list of
wacky challenges and collect
as much money as possible
3. Bring the tins back to
the Union where they will be
counted and prizes awarded.
Past challenges have
included forming a conga
in Trafalgar Square, tiddly-
winking the length of Oxford
Street, riding the horses of the
apocalypse at the Trocadero
and streaking through the
Bank of England.
These are just to give you a
flavour of the wackiness that
is expected of you. The chal-
lenges for this year may be
similar, they may be different.
Come along to the Union from
11am on Saturday to find out
what they are.
Finally, thanks to everyone
who contributed to the balloon
race for Children in Need and
to everyone who helped on
the day. After a long morning
on the controls of a helium
cylinder, all the balloons were
launched last Friday lunch-
time from Beit Quad. News
on prize winners will follow
when we start receiving bal-
loons back!
RAG to raid London... again

The Chess Club has had a
very good start to this season,
thanks to good organisation
and the enthusiasm shown
by its members. We have won
every game we have played so
far, in both the ULU League
and the Middlesex League.
We are always looking for
more players for the teams so,
if you think you have a decent
skill level at chess, please
email chess@icl.ac.uk.
We will be holding a tourna-
ment in a few weeks time.
Here, chess club members
can participate to win £20 or
more. The matches can be
played at your convenience;
you do not need to come to
the club if you cannot. The
format of the tournament will
be like this:
● Each player will play five
games played over the year
● You can play the games
any time you want (but before
April 2005)
● The format of the tourna-
ment will be Swiss
● After the five rounds, the
winners will be decided.
● The winner will get £20 and
runner-up £10. These prizes
will be confirmed depending
upon the number of entrants.
Please email us if you want
to take part.
The Chess Club will organ-
ise various other events like
this, with members getting
the opportunity to play our
resident grandmaster in
January. We also offer various
subsidies to our members,
such as free entry to ULU
competitions. If you are not
a member, it costs only £5 to
become one, but you should
get back more than that over
the year.
The Chess Club is organis-
ing a Christmas Dinner for
its members. We are also
trying to organise some fix-
tures against Oxford and
Cambridge to determine who
is at the top of the game.
In out first ULU games of
the season, we beat King’s
College London 4-2 and then
outplayed LSE 5-1. This was a
very good result, as we were
beaten 6-0 by LSE last sea-
son, who then went on to win
the League.
In the Middlesex League,
where we have failed to have
a convincing performance for
the last few seasons, it was
pleasing to win 6-2 against
Hendon in the opening
match. We then went on to
win 5-3 against Hendon and
7-1 against Harrow. The team
beat our arch-rivals, LSE, last
week 8-0.
The Imperial College
Chess Club consists of a
diverse group of students
from all years. We meet
every Wednesday at 7pm in
Seminar Room 3, located on
the third floor of the Union
Building. We are always look-
ing for more talent. It would
be great to have you partic-
ipating, whether you are a
grandmaster or an absolute
beginner.

ac.uk with your queries, and

Chess Club enjoy winning start to year
CHESS
By Rob Hansen
On Friday 29 October, eight
of the club’s finest packed up
the minibus for a weekend
of biking mayhem in North
Wales on the awesome, fully
marked out trails of Coed-Y-
Brenin.
Andy, chief club roadie,
decided to join us for the
weekend too, hoping to do
some serious lycra-clad rip-
ping up of the remote roads
of north Wales.
After successfully escap-
ing the congestion of rush
hour London, we made good
progress until we got to Wales,
where dual carriageways
have not yet been discovered
and our vehicle was a grossly
underpowered knackered old
Union minibus, which strug-
gled up several inclines in
first gear!
We eventually arrived at
around midnight at a village
called Trawsfynnyd, famed
for its nuclear power sta-
tion, where we had booked a
‘Norwegian log cabin’ for the
weekend. We drove through
the town three times before
finally admitting we didn’t
actually know where to go
and telephoning the lodge.
Unfortunately, with none of us
able to pronounce the name
of the town, communicating
our location proved problem-
atic. Anyway, we finally found
the place, complete with cen-
tral heating, a kitchen and
shower, with Chillout Moods
4 playing in the background
and free beer! No freezing
our arses off at the Imperial
mountain hut this year!
On Saturday morning, we
were greeted by sunshine and
clear blue skies and headed to
Coed-Y-Brenin, stopping brief-
ly in Trawsfynnyd for a bacon
butty after parting company
with Andy and his road bike.
By 10.30am we were hitting
the trails. First up, the MBR
loop – a medium length but
action packed route.
We all set off together ini-
tially but then agreed to split
into two groups after the ini-
tial climb gave most of us a
rude awakening (most nota-
bly Seb on his single speed
jump bike!) The climb made
way for an awesome single-
track descent, which was just
a taste of what was to come.
The MBR loop is a prime
example of what all moun-
tainbike trails should be:
smooth, gentle climbs with a
mixture of fast, tight, highly
technical and highly engi-
neered descents that cry out
to be attacked. Fantastic, but
extremely hard on our bikes
– and with our large group
it wasn’t long before we had
our first breakdown, a slightly
buckled front wheel follow-
ing a rather comical unin-
tended off-piste excursion.
Punctures, chain breakages
and gear problems followed
soon after.
Having completed the MBR
loop by lunchtime, we decided
to do the slightly less techni-
cal but scenic Red Bull loop
in the afternoon. Although
less challenging from a fit-
ness and skill point of view,
it was every bit as enjoyable
as the MBR loop, with the
harsher, bumpier and rockier
descents providing an equally
thrilling experience at speed,
with some serious air to be
had too. Too much air for
some – several members of
the group experienced some
spectacular rider-over-han-
dlebar crashes!
We got back to the log
cabin in the evening, finding
Andy sitting patiently in the
warmth, having finished his
84 mile morning ride around
Snowdonia hours ago. He
revealed he had bumped into
some “friendly” Imperial
medic mountaineers, who just
happened to be on his route
over Mount Snowdon, the
highest mountain in Wales.
Later, we decided to go
for a pub dinner, only to dis-
cover that none of the local
pubs served food! Unfazed,
we drove to the next town
where after much searching
we found a pub style restau-
rant... and an off licence.
Sunday was another fabu-
lous day, with not a sign of
cloud in the sky. Andy once
again hit the road, whilst
we headed back to Coed-Y-
Brenin. With many of us still
sore from the first day’s rid-
ing, we decided we would
split into two groups, with a
couple of us doing the epic 34
mile Karrimor loop – a long,
hard and really scenic route
winding deep into the hills
with the occasional highly
technical singletrack section
– whilst the others would do
the slightly less demanding
Sport loop, an ‘all the fun bits’
route.
With none of us able to have
showers, the six hour journey
home was an interesting one
to say the least! All in all,
a highly successful weekend.
Next up, Scotland...
