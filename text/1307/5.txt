In laboratories across the
world, animals are used to
test different drugs and com-
pounds. In some cases, these
drugs are lifesaving treat-
ments that will ultimately
save many peoples lives. In
others, it is a slightly differ-
ent story, where animals are
used to test cosmetics and
other pleasurable products
designed for our everyday
use.
Is it right to use animals
in this way, for human gain?
Shouldwedistinguishbetween
the use of animals in cancer
laboratories and the cosmetic
industry? Is one right and one
wrong; one better or worse?
There are many questions to
consider. For example, are
there any alternatives? And
do these experiments really
work? This report will attempt
to highlight the controversial
issues and gain insight into
the facts behind animal test-
ing. And then it will be up to
you...
Approximately 2.7 mil-
lion live animal experiments
were authorized in the UK
in 2002. This may sound like
an immense number, but it is
half of what was carried out
30 years ago. One reason for
the decline was the introduc-
tion of the Animal Act in 1986,
stating that no animal experi-
ments may be conducted if
there is a realistic alternative.
However, British law states
that any new drug must be
tested on at least two differ-
ent species of mammal, one
being a large non-rodent. So
where is the middle ground?
And what is a realistic alter-
native?
Firstly, one should address
whether testing on animals
actually works and what is
gained from such work. Many
people have received vaccines
for diseases such as polio,
measles, mumps and tuber-
culosis (TB). We owe animal
testing for the development
of such drugs. Furthermore,
antibiotics, HIV drugs, insu-
lin and anti-cancer treat-
ments which have helped vast
amounts of people around
the world are all tested and
developed through the use of
animals.
Is animal testing a ‘neces-
sary evil’? Is the use of ani-
mals comparable to allowing
a human to die or suffer?
Attempting to distinguish
between what is morally right
and wrong is difficult. Some
would comment that human
life has a greater intrin-
sic value than an animal.
Legislation and strict govern-
ment guidelines ensure that
lab animals are protected
from cruelty and mistreat-
ment. But how much do we
know about the stress-related
effects of testing, even if treat-
ed well?
Many animals are put to
sleep before feeling any pain.
Such procedures also follow
strict rules and regulations
on how to anaesthetise an ani-
mal prior to testing. Despite
this, isn’t the whole process
traumatic for the animals?
Alternatives to animal test-
ing include in vitro studies.
This means studying the
problem outside the living ani-
mal. For example, culturing
cancer cells in a dish rather
than examining live animals
or testing in vivo. However,
many scientists believe that
in vitro studies are only a
starting point to providing
basic non-clinical testing. A
clear picture is only gained
when observing what is actu-
ally happening in an animal
model.
The use of as few animals
as possible is the primary aim
of most medical researchers.
The search for alternatives
continues and is guided by the
‘three R’s’ principle; reduc-
tion, refinement and replace-
ment. As mentioned before,
there have been significant
reductions in the number of
animals used over the last
30 years. Refinement covers
areas that include animal
housing and veterinary care.
While animals are still being
used, it ensures that they
are treated with respect and
care. Replacement continues
to strive to look for non-ani-
mal alternatives. Techniques
such as in vitro studies can
replace some animal experi-
ments. However, it will be
some years until they can be
replaced completely.
Furthermore, research
institutes such as the infa-
mous Huntingdon Life
Sciences are pioneering the
in vitro technology. Also, it is
a supporter of the Fund for
the Replacement of Animals
in Medical Experiments
(FRAME). So despite cur-
rent needs for animal-based
research, scientists do
acknowledge that reducing
and replacing animal testing
is the future.
Such controversial issues
are always accompanied
by supporters (both for and
against). Many protests have
occurred over various ethical
issues. Recently, Cambridge
University had to abandon
plans for a primate research
centre as costs had apparent-
ly escalated due to new ani-
mal welfare regulations and
increasing security measures.
However, the centre still could
go ahead as planning permis-
sion is valid for 5 years.
Despite the announcement
that the centre was going to
be axed, in July of this year
animal rights groups chal-
lenged the decision for plan-
ning permission for the centre
in the high court. The appeal
was eventually overturned.
Many medical research cen-
tres face similar costs con-
cerning security against vio-
lent protestors. Animal rights
terrorism was estimated to
have caused £150 million of
property damage over the
last 25 years. Is it justified to
attack scientists who are ulti-
mately only doing their job?
However, there are organisa-
tions that demonstrate peace-
fully such as Animal Aid and
the National Anti-Vivisection
Society, which strive to edu-
cate and promote animal
rights.
To put animal testing in
context, in the US 5bn ani-
mals were used in the food
industry compared to 18m for
research, both of which ben-
efit humans. Can we, should
we compare the two?
One could suggest that we
all become vegetarians as
well as stopping testing on
animals. How far does it go?
There is no easy answer to
many questions posed in this
article. But hopefully, by read-
ing this you are now more
aware of the controversial
pros and cons associated with
animal based research. At the
end of the day, the answers
and opinions are yours.
Is animal testing a necessary or unnecessary evil?

This week I added three plas-
tic bags to my ever-increas-
ing collection. I did try to keep
it to a minimum – but life
got in the way. An emergency
milk outing and before I knew
it my pint had been bundled
up in plastic (if only they
would ask); it was raining and
a newspaper without a bag
would have been intolerable;
and my new CD just had to
come home in one of those
dinky wee ones.
Based on this, my average
rate of consumption is 150
bags per year. By UK stand-
ards I am actually doing well,
as the average is 290 plastic
bags per person per year.
Indeed, our plastic bag use
has reached epidemic propor-
tions. As well as littering our
environment and blocking
our waterways, plastic bags
kill large numbers of wild-
life every year. Birds, whales,
seals and turtles, often mis-
taking them for jellyfish,
ingest the bags. They do not
breakdown easily and stay in
their intestines, causing pain
and death. When the animals
do die, the bags are released
back into the sea: ready to be
eaten again.
In an effort to curb our
addiction, major supermar-
kets offer us ‘lifetime bags’
and in the past there were
penny saving incentives if we
brought our own. (Sainsbury’s
canned their ‘Penny Back’
scheme in July this year in
favour of improved instore
recycling points – apparently
few customers were using the
scheme.)
B&Q, however, are the
first UK company to seri-
ously integrate the challenge
of plastic bag reduction into
their company policy. Their
new scheme is simple: for
each bag customers request
at Scottish B&Q shops, five
pence is added to the bill,
charged through a barcode
on the bag. The money raised
from the scheme goes to the
‘Keep Scotland Beautiful’
scheme. If the trial is suc-
cessful, it could be launched
at B&Q shops across England
and Wales.
But B&Q are only one com-
pany. Surely, to really make
a difference we need a plas-
tic bag tax to apply across
the board? Surely we need
Government action? Well,
apparently not, and this is not
likely to change in the near
future.
Despite the well-document-
ed success of our progressive
neighbours across the Irish
Sea (commencing in March
2002, the 15 euro cent per bag
‘PlasTax’ has resulted in a
90% reduction in plastic bag
consumption), the UK gov-
ernment has made it clear
that it will not be following
suit. The line is that, as plas-
tic bags comprise only 1% of
our waste, such a tax would
be quite limited in dealing
with the broader issues.
Yet while it is true that
tackling plastic bags is only
a small part of the waste
problem, it is an important
part because it can make peo-
ple think twice. In terms of
changing people’s mindsets
and instilling a sustainability
ethos, it is a great place to
begin. Bags may only be 1%
of the waste stream, but they
are a highly visible 1%.
Of course, I hear you cry:
“what about my free bin
liner?” You are not alone. The
British Retail Consortium,
in their staunch opposition,
believe that if such taxes
were introduced the demand
for other single use bags, like
bin bags, would rise dramati-
cally. Certainly this seems to
be the Irish experience. But,
in truth, large proportions
of plastic bags go straight
into the rubbish and are not
reused in households anyway,
and very few are returned
to shops for reprocessing. A
modest sum for a bin liner
does not seem like too much
hardship to me: when we pay
for things we value them.
In the meantime, for those
who feel a serious bout of
‘bag-guilt’ coming on, get
your reusable calico happen-
ing and those three simple
but albeit difficult words, “no
bag thanks,” may just be in
reach.
