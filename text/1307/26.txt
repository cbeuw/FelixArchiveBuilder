Russell’s band of merry men finally
deliver a performance to be proud of
Imperial Medicals
Men’s 1st 52
Brunel Men’s 1st 10
By Jim Watchorn
In what was from the outset a
crucialcontestinPremiership
South B, Imperial Medicals
First XV raised their game
from previous weeks to defeat
a disappointing Brunel side
by 52 points to 10.
A weak first 30 minutes
by the medics, where the
defence was tested time and
again, was overcome by skip-
per Pete Russell touching
down for a try that proved
to turn the game. From then
on, motivated by their chubby
captain, the Medicals played
like a transformed side to
that of recent weeks.
Brunel kicked off with a
strong wind behind them. Fly
half James Morris opened
the scoring, striking the ball
between the sticks to put the
medics 3–0 up. Brunel pushed
back hard and exposed holes
in the medics defence. The
continual battering of the
medics back line eventually
led to the Brunel inside cen-
tre clearing the line and duly
converting to make the score
7 -3 to Brunel.
Again a strong forward
performance from the medic
pack, who dominated for 80
minutes, created several
try scoring opportunities
which were squandered by
the three quarters, although
the pressure culminated in
a deserved pushover try by
the medics tight five beneath
the posts.
Both sides continually
infringed throughout the first
half as the London Society
Referee maintained a strong
presence and kept the two
battling sides under control.
This was to the detriment of
lose head Xander Ancock, giv-
ing away a penalty for holding
on within kicking distance of
the medics posts and allow-
ing Brunel to pull the score
to 10 apiece at half time and
winning himself 10 minutes in
the sin bin.
The medics scrum contin-
ued to dominate in the second
half, allowing powerhouse
Pete Russell to take the med-
ics ahead with his superb
individual try to the right of
the posts. This try ended the
scoring for Brunel who for
the majority of the first half
looked dominant.
With the Medicals back
on 15 men, Morris and his
two wingers perked up and
provided some much needed
strength to a lacklustre back
line. Players worked harder
to fill in and the defence
stood strong. Forwards
were able to retain the ball,
with second half possession
being over 65% in the med-
ics favour. Unforced errors
were also minimised and the
side provided coaches Rollitt
and Hamilton Eadie with the
rugby they have been striv-
ing for.
Russell got his second try,
along with Sinnett touching
down for one and hungry
Cameron Sullivan clearing
the line on several occasions.
Rollitt made his changes
with 20 minutes to go, mov-
ing Jonnie Ward to blind side
flanker, Watchorn back on for
another 15 minutes at tight
head and lightning Mark
Willsdon replacing try scoring
Piers Thomas on the wing.
The awesome medic pack,
tired of dictating the game to
Brunel, provided Morris with
more ball and created superb
tries for Huw Williams. One of
the finest pieces of individual
playinthematchledtoHumor
Gurney touching down under
the posts. With the medics
dishing out 42 points in the
second half with no response,
Russell can finally be proud of
a performance fit for Imperial
Medicals First XV.

Mixed hockey fun
2nd annual Royal
Holloway Mixed Hockey
Tournament
By Pikey
On Sunday 14 November, 18
intrepid souls from Imperial
College Hockey Club met at
the Union for the short trip
to Staines to participate in
(and attempt to win) the 2nd
Annual Royal Holloway Mixed
Hockey Tournament.
We all desperately
attempted to load ourselves
into Chardonnay’s wheels of
steel but unfortunately there
aren’t 18 seats in a Vauxhall
Corsa so the rest of us, ie
all of the boys plus Moonie
and Spanner, had to travel
in Mothercare’s minibus of
death.
Despite the GPS naviga-
tion system on Bleeding
Dick’s phone telling us to do
a U-turn “immediately” on
the Hammersmith flyover,
we duly arrived at Staines
hockey club safely and fash-
ionably early for an Imperial
team. So early in fact that
they had only just opened
the pitch. Still, that meant
plenty of time for the tradi-
tional Imperial warm-up of
smashing or drag-flicking all
the balls we had bought at
the goal, though in truth most
ended up over the fence.
Soon the other teams
arrived, from UCL, Barts,
Queen Mary’s, Royal Vets, St
Georges and Oxford Brookes.
Our 18 players were duly split
into two ‘equal’ teams, though
someone seemingly forgot to
suggest that we had an equal
mix of attackers and defend-
ers on each, which made
position picking interesting.
Pikey took control of the A
team, whilst Chardonnay led
the Bs.
The tournament took the
form of a round robin group
stage with the top four from
each group going through to
the quarter finals.
Both Imperial teams quali-
fied for the quarter finals, and
the B’s were up against UCL
A’s first. Six minutes each
way was not enough to sepa-
rate the sides and the game
went to penalties. Moonie,
who had by this stage cut
both her knees and had a
lump the size of a ping-pong
ball on one stepped up to take
the first and was unlucky to
see it saved. Sieve then saved
brilliantly from UCL
’s first
to keep us in the shootout.
Brandon Lee then stepped
up and slotted the second
penalty home, which heaped
the pressure on UCL. They
crumbled and failed to score
again. It all rested on George
Harrison. How could we
doubt him! UCL were beaten,
and the B’s were through to
the semis.
The A team had a tough
draw against Holloway A’s
who had steamrollered every-
one in their group games. The
game was tight and Imperial
were leading 2-1 at half time
thanks to Essex Wideboy
slaloming through the entire
Holloway team before tucking
it neatly away in the top left
hand corner and Spellcheck’s
comical goal from a short cor-
ner. In the second half, we
were poor, they got two and
the A’s were out.
In the semis, the B team
faced Oxford Brookes who
after a poor start had shaken
off their minibus blues and
were playing as well as we
thought they would. They
duly won though not through
a lack of effort from Imperial,
especially Moonie who again
spent time scraping herself
off the astroturf on several
occasions but played on.
Then the floodlights failed
and the final was delayed,
which allowed a few choice
and comedy insults to be
hurled at UCL in the dark.
The final was eventually
contested by UCL B and
Oxford Brookes A. Imperial
joined the rest of the teams
in abusing UCL, but they
shrugged off our chants and
deservedly won.
Theeveningwasroundedoff
with the raffle, where Essex
Wideboy and Bleeding Dick
took home prizes (Haribo
and a ‘luxury’ toiletries set to
be precise, so we have team
shower gel and food to last for
several weeks at least!)
Notable memories from the
day included:
Essex Wideboy single-hand-
edly attempting to score all
the goals for the A-team to
get them through and doing
a pretty good job, though he
took a rollocking from Top
Heavy for giving the ball away
once! How sweet.
Pikey taking a substan-
tial squirtfull of port from a
super-soaker whilst umpir-
ing Oxford Brookes versus
Barts as punishment for bad
decisions – many thanks to
the Shelly from Queen Mary
for that! Also a big hand to
him for playing as sweeper
which was way out of position
as he is usually to be found
swinging off the opponents’
crossbar in the search of that
elusive nick to claim a goal.
Mothercare continuing
his passion for arguing with
umpires and nearly starting a
mass brawl with Royal Vets.
Brandon Lee, for scoring
goals... apparently?
Tight Lips’ performance
in goal in replacement of
Spanner who, because of the
‘3 girls on the pitch at all
times rule’, was forced to play
in defence!
Italian Job, steady at the
back as ever.
Sieve’s great goalkeeping
and also his ability to hunt
down and destroy the pikey
Oxford Brookes keeper who
tried to nick his kit.
Too Keen for being there
without his contact lenses
– did you actually touch the
ball?
Big thanks to the rest for
turning up.

Imperial Women’s 1st 14
UCL Women’s 1st 2
By Lizzie Wortley
From the quiet beginnings
in the changing room, where
Michelle attempted to rally
the troops, Imperial’s wom-
en’s lacrosse team went on
to have their best team game
yet.
An early goal by UCL was
typical of our slow start, but
we soon responded, coming
back with a force of our own.
Hannah was beautifully on
target and two speedy goals
set up the form of the game.
Although UCL often had
possession of the ball, our
brilliant defence were not to
be beaten. Shivani with her
ferocious turquoise stick had
the UCL girls withering in
our path. Half time, and we
were 6-1 up.
In the second half, Ada
was not to be stopped, bring-
ing the ball out of defence.
Caroline seemed to always be
in the perfect position to just
pop it in the goal.
Everyone worked really
well together and no move
seemed to be wasted. From
Lindsay’s amazing saves to
Ali’s work behind the goal in
attack, this machine could not
be stopped and the goals kept
adding up.
We zoomed past UCL with
ease to win the game 14-2.
There’s no ‘I’ in team
