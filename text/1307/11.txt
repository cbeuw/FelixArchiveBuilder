As a Wye student, one comes
across a lot of things that are
beingpublicisedCollege-wide,
regardless of the fact that we
couldn’t possibly travel the 70
miles in time between lec-
tures, or at all to return after
11 at night. College and Union
events are listed, from careers
talks to ents nights, along
with meetings, feedback and
elections for the people who
organise them.
To a point, Wye students will
say it’s nice to know what’s
going on, but after a while
they develop a very rapid
‘irrelevance reflex’. That is to
say, they decide in an instant
whether the latest piece of
information being thrown
their way has any bearing
outside the M25, and if not,
immediately ignore the post-
er, turn the page or press the
delete button.
I dare say some students
will be flicking through this
very newspaper and ignoring
every page but this one. So
why am I using the one page
they will look at to waffle on
about just the sort of thing
they don’t want to read?
Those of you who read last
week’s Felix will have heard
about the Imperial College
Union strategic review.
Everyone else: wait! Hold
that irrelevance reflex for a
minute!
This plan will determine the
long term plans of Imperial
College Union over (and
beyond) the next four years:
what it should continue doing,
what it should do more of,
what it should do in a com-
pletely different way, and what
it shouldn’t bother doing.
But what you need to know
is that for these purposes,
‘Imperial College Union’ does
specifically include Wye, and
for that matter all other cam-
puses too.
The next part of this review
will be a College-wide survey.
Now, the words ‘College-wide’
have probably set off alarm
bells again, but the good news
here is that someone (me)
has already gone through the
survey with a Wye-relevance
filter.
Wye students will be given
their own, specially adapted
version of the questionnaire,
asking not only what use you
might actually be making of
South Kensington activities
and services, but what you
would rather have down at
Wye.
The Union want this review
to help them serve all of their
members, including those not
based at South Kensington.
They want to know if you
know what’s available up
there, and if there is anything
you would like to make use of
sometimes, and if so what is
stopping you from doing so.
They also need to know how
many of their members would
actually use facilities in South
Kensington following various
proposed improvements: for
these questions, a ‘no’ is just
as useful as a ‘yes’.
Wye College Union Society
want this review to give them
some information relevant to
them, too. What do you like
about the Union in Wye? What
could they do better? What
areas do you think are under-
resourced? Again, this is just
as relevant to those who don’t
use the Union, in order to
say why you don’t use it: say-
ing what would make it more
suited to your needs or tastes,
or even letting us know here
and now that the suggestions
would not help, is all useful.
I realise that not everyone
in Wye has this irrelevance
reflex: some are keen at least
to read about everything hap-
pening in London, even if they
can’t get to all of it, and of
course their views are impor-
tant too; it’s just that they are
less likely to need telling. If
you are one of those students,
this is a valuable chance to
say which aspects of South
Kensington life you would
like to experience, and what
if anything is stopping you,
so efforts at campus commu-
nications and inter-campus
events are focused on the
areas you want.
Your Union wants to go in
the direction that you want,
but can only do this if you say
what direction that is.
So please do look at the
questionnaire. Some parts do
only apply to students who
have been to various places or
events at South Kensington:
these parts are labelled, so
students with a well-devel-
oped irrelevance reflex can
take full advantage of that and
skip straight to the next sec-
tion. All we are asking is that
you find the parts that are
relevant to you: we guarantee
they are in there.
Everyone completing the
questionnaire will be entered
into a prize draw, so the
chance to win a PlayStation, a
holiday voucher or some beer
could also be relevant to you.
Is this really relevant to us?
