in brief
US-led push for UN
cloning ban falters
A divided United Nations on
Friday voted against a US-led
campaign to ban the cloning
of human embryos for thera-
peutic uses, namely stem cell
research. Instead, a non-bind-
ing statement was accepted,
which calls on nations “to
prohibit any attempts to
create human life through
cloning processes and any
research intended to achieve
that aim”.
NASA launches
cosmic blast hunter
A new space observatory has
been launched to hunt down
and study the most power-
ful explosions seen in the
Universe since the Big Bang
itself. The Swift satellite will
detect and analyse gamma-
ray bursts – very intense but
fleeting flashes of radiation.
Scientists think they may sig-
nal the birth of black holes,
which are created when giant
stars fall in on themselves.
China joins NASA
in considering
space exploration
China and fifteen other coun-
tries joined NASA officials
to discuss how they might
cooperate with US plans for
human exploration of the
moon and Mars. The Chinese
delegation was invited, even
though China is not among
the countries participating
in the International Space
Station.
Fossil ape may be
ancestor of all apes
An ape that lived 13m years
ago in what is now Spain
may have been the last com-
mon ancestor of all apes.
The fossil provides a miss-
ing link between great apes
and lesser apes such as gib-
bons. The creature, named
Pierolapithecus catalaunicus,
had a stiff lower spine and
flexible wrists that would
have made it a tree-climbing
specialist.
Arctic people at a
loss for words
What are the words used by
indigenous peoples in the
Arctic for “robin”, “elk” or
“salmon”? Many indigenous
languages have no words for
the new animals, insects and
plants advancing north as glo-
bal warming thaws the polar
ice and lets forests creep
over tundra. “We can’t even
describe what we’re seeing,”
said the chair of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference.
Could antimatter be used to create superbombs?
By Kate Wighton
Science communication
Early last month, The San
Francisco Chronicle alleged
that the US Air Force was
quietly spending millions
of dollars on an antimatter
weapons project.
This program could pro-
duce the superweapons of
the future. Antimatter bombs
could be hand-held but also
be extremely powerful – since
half a gram of antimatter
would release energy equiva-
lent to that of the Hiroshima
bomb.
The US Air Force were, the
Chronicle claims, initially
quite open about the project,
but following initial enquiries,
employees were forbidden to
discuss it.
At first glance, this appears
very alarming. But are anti-
matter weapons really pos-
sible?
First of all, what is antimat-
ter? Antimatter first came
to the attention of scientists
in 1930, when as part of a
theory describing the behav-
iour of electrons, Paul Dirac
predicted the electron to
have an equivalent positive-
ly-charged partner: the anti-
electron. This was treated
with some scepticism until
1932 when Carl Anderson
actually observed a particle
that behaved like an electron
but was a positively charged
– this was the first evidence of
the anti-electron, or positron.
Since then, antimatter part-
ners have been found for the
other sub-atomic particles
that make up matter, such
as anti-protons and anti-neu-
trons. When antimatter and
matter collide, they annihilate
each other to produce huge
amounts of energy, hence the
military’s interest in using
positron bombs.
Antimatter would produce
‘clean’ superbombs. Dan
Bowerman, who works on the
BaBar antimatter project at
Imperial College, explains:
“[using positrons] would be
useful as basically all materi-
al matter on earth has many,
many electrons so positrons
would annihilate with them.
This would give off lots of
energy and no pollutants
while causing much damage
from the enormous amounts
of energy produced”.
CERN, which sits on the
Swiss-French border, is the
worlds largest particle phys-
ics centre. The centre gen-
erates and investigates anti-
matter (although there are
other institutions that gener-
ate antimatter – the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) being one with which
Imperial is closely associated
via the BaBar project). Rather
handily, the CERN website
contains the question: “Can
we make antimatter bombs?”
Their answer was reassur-
ingly to the point: “There is no
possibility to make antimatter
bombs”.
Phew. The main reason
appears to be that antimatter
is incredibly difficult to store
and can, therefore, not be
accumulated in high enough
quantities. Bowerman
explains: “it is relatively easy
to create positrons, but stor-
ing them is another business
and storing them over poten-
tially long periods of time
should be very difficult and
also very expensive”.
If antimatter comes into
contact with matter, it will
annihilate. Therefore, find-
ing something to store them
in (bearing in mind that our
world is made up of matter)
is very difficult. The fact that
the particles bear the same
charge and therefore repel
each other makes things even
more challenging.
Another tricky point about
antimatter is that there
appears to be little, if any,
antimatter in the universe.
This has been puzzling scien-
tists for years as it is thought
that matter and antimatter
were produced in equal quan-
tities in the Big Bang. As we
have no natural resource of
antimatter as we do coal or
oil, all antimatter has to be
made artificially.
This involves accelerat-
ing particles to the speed of
light in huge particle accel-
erators, and smashing them
into smaller particles, some
of which decay into antiparti-
cles. However, these antipar-
ticles fly off in all directions at
very high speeds. Therefore,
only the particles that fly off
in a certain direction can be
caught, making the process of
generating antimatter rather
inefficient. The amount of
antimatter produced each
year at CERN could power
a 100W bulb for just 15 min-
utes.
As the CERN website
explains: “Scientists realised
that the atom bomb was a
real possibility many years
before one was actually built
and exploded, and then the
public was totally surprised
and amazed. The antimatter
bomb on the other hand has
been imagined by the public
who want to know more about
it, yet we have known for a
very long time that it’s not at
all a practical device”.
On the general topic of
military research, Bowerman
had this to add: “With enough
resources, scientists can
often come up with very
clever technologies that you
can’t initially imagine and the
military has the resources to
make this happen.
He continued: “Let’s hope
that the costs remain very
high and the US military
dominance makes it some-
what pointless to pursue
these technologies”.
Therefore it looks, for the
moment, as though we don’t
have to worry about antimat-
ter weapons wiping humanity
off the face of the Earth. After
all, we already have perfectly
adequate nuclear and biologi-
cal weapons to do that.
Antimatter bombs would be devastating in theory, but
would they ever work in practice?

Science and beauty: two com-
pletely unrelated subjects you
might think at first glance,
the first cold and empirical,
the second forever subject
to personal opinion with no
small dose of passion thrown
in. However, at the Royal
Institute on Wednesday 10
November, Dr Armand Marie
Leroi, Reader in Evolutionary
Developmental Biology at
Imperial College, argued that
science now provides a cred-
ible explanation for beauty in
the human face.
This has not always been
perceived to be the case.
Until the Renaissance, beau-
ty was defined by symme-
try: the geometry of facial
features in statues of the
time reflects this definition
of physical perfection. It was
with the publication in 1871 of
The Descent of Man, wherein
Charles Darwin extended his
concept of sexual selection
from animals to man, that
beauty was for the first time
defined in scientific terms:
as rare, particular and totally
arbitrary.
Research since has
reversed each of these origi-
nal beliefs: scientists today
believe that beauty is not
what is rare but what is com-
mon, not particular but uni-
versal, and not arbitrary but
rich in meaning. For example,
Sir Francis Galton, Darwin’s
own cousin, demonstrated
that people tend to find an
average face more beautiful
than one that deviates signifi-
cantly from the norm. Studies
asking men to rate women
in terms of appearance have
shown cultural invariance.
And who can doubt that beau-
ty has meaning when we are
beginning to speak of a “glo-
bal standard of beauty” and
there is a multi-million pound
industry devoted to it?
In addition to these three
defining traits, there is one
other that Dr Marie Leroi
has identified as particularly
interesting and of conse-
quence for a complete expla-
nation of beauty: its role as a
certificate of health. A person
lacking the scars of small-
pox, free of an infestation of
lice or devoid of scurvy is
clearly more attractive than
one who suffers from any of
these afflictions. In modern
British society, most of us
enjoy a reasonably good level
of health. So why is it that
there are still such significant
differences in beauty?
The reason, believes Dr
Marie Leroi, is that beauty
today is largely a function of
our genetic make-up (nature),
rather than the environment
in which we live (nurture).
In a classic case of nature
versus nurture, he argues in
favour of a dominant role for
nature: “a great deal of vari-
ation in beauty is due to vari-
ation in our genetic load…
we are all born with around
300 mutations that affect our
bodies for the worse in one
way or another... nearly all...
affect the face”.
The evidence for this theory
comes from observations that
people of mixed race are often
extraordinarily beautiful. A
good example is Saira Mohan,
who featured on the cover of
Newsweek in November 2003
as the most beautiful face in
the world. Saira is a quarter
Irish, a quarter French and
half Punjabi.
Dr Marie Leroi argues
that her beauty stems from
a lower than average number
of mutations as a result of her
mixed race heritage: because
mutations are almost always
recessive, they will only be
expressed if two copies, one
from the father and one from
the mother, are present. The
less genetically similar two
people are, for example if
they stem from two different
races rather than the same,
the lower the chance of them
sharing the same mutations.
If “beauty is the absence of
imperfections” as Dr Marie
Leroi contends, then the
expression of fewer muta-
tions in people of mixed race
explains their greater beauty.
In this way, empirical sci-
ence explains the subjective.
Yet, it must be borne in mind
that there is also a strong
cultural component at play
here. Would people of mixed
race have been considered
quite so beautiful in a less
racially tolerant society of
past times? Probably not.
While Dr Marie Leroi’s theo-
ry is very plausible in today’s
society, it remains to be seen
whether it will stand the test
of time.

Science attempts to comprehend the mystery of beauty
More than skin deep? Science is trying to explain beauty
“...half a gram of

what is common, not
particular but univer-
sal, and not arbitrary
