Decision on deadly drugs
As you read this article, Numaan Chaudhry asks you to consider
your intake of drugs – legal and illegal
The pharmaceutical industry
took another blow last Friday
as it dealt with the effects of
an investigation by Dr David
Graham, a reputable US Food
and Drugs Administration
(FDA) authority.
Dr Graham’s preliminary
investigation ended with the
conclusion that five house-
hold drugs may not be safe,
despite their approval by
health authorities during
their initial stages of produc-
tion. As a result, almost £7bn
of stock value in the indus-
try was blown and the equity
market receded to a value of
just 4805 after it’s recent peak
following George W Bush’s
re-election.
The FTSE 100 also declined
but still remained above the
landmark 4760 level. The
five perpetrating drugs, all
of which face the remote
possibility of gradual with-
drawal from the markets,
are Vioxx, Crestor, Accutane,
Serevent and an unnamed
cancer drug made by Roche
Holdings. However, the FDA
has been reluctant to back Dr
Graham’s claims absolutely,
having previously dragged
its feet in a similar situation
when claims were made that
anti-depressants could be
dangerous if taken by youths
regularly.
Vioxx, a drug claiming to
soothe the effects of arthri-
tis, was the trigger for Dr
Graham’s enquiry into the
pharmaceutical industry as
a whole. The maker of Vioxx,
Merck Plc, initially denied the
accusation that 28,000 heart
attacks and deaths were
caused by the drug.
Crestor, one of the drugs
at the centre of the investi-
gation and an effective anti-
cholesterol drug, is forecast
to account for 22% of the
earnings of AstraZeneca by
2008. This, of course, had an
immediate impact on Astra’s
shares, which were down
222p at £21.45, and futures
derivatives. The £3.7bn loss
in share value was the high-
est of the sector, with the
fall estimated at almost 10%.
What makes this particularly
worrying to Astra executives
is the dependence they have
on Crestor’s contribution to
revenues, an estimated $1bn
in 2004 alone.
Dr Graham considered the
drug risky and urged the
FDA to probe further into it’s
chemical make-up and effects
after he highlighted the
potential of Crestor to cause
muscle and kidney damage.
To ensure a total annihilation
of the drug, Europe’s health
and drug regulators initiated
a review of Crestor’s recom-
mended dosage.
Serevent is currently used
by a minority of asthma suffer-
ers worldwide, but its effects
on blood pressure caused
GlaxoSmithKline’s 4% drop
in share price. Despite the
fact that Serevent accounts
for under 1% of Glaxo’s sales,
£2.8bn of Glaxo stocks lost
value last week. This was
attributed in part to charges
being filed by... you guessed
it... Eliot Spitzer (see last
week’s Business section).
Having increased his net to
the pharmaceuticals indus-
try, the New York Attorney
General filed charges against
Glaxo for its reluctance to
reveal data from trials that
indicated an increased
chance of suicidal behaviour
among children taking one of
its flagship drugs, Paxil.
Accutane, as well as
Pfizer’s Bextra and Abbott
Laboratories’ Meridia, were
also suspected of causing
serious after-effects. The
manufacturer of Accutane,
Roche Phamaceuticals Ltd,
categorically denied the pos-
sibility of psychosis, a dis-
ease that raises thoughts
of suicide, being an effect
of Accutance. However, the
market showed no mercy as
it steamed across the whole
board of pharmaceuticals,
ripping down the peak stock
prices of all the manufactur-
ers.
Another drug has also
been hitting the headlines
recently, but with a more
sinister underlying purpose.
Afghanistan is leading the
war for narcotics, it seems,
after the country’s output of
opium shadowed the minimal
amounts produced in Africa
or Eastern Europe.
One in ten Afghans are
involved in this lucrative
trade, which is actually one of
the main sources (60%) of the
country’s GDP
. According to
the UN Office on Drugs and
Crime, Afghanistan has over
130,000 hectares of poppies.
Opium trade in Afghanistan
ceased during the US war
on the Taliban and has only
recently started generating
revenue for the country. The
cultivation of opium and its
subsequent benefits to the
country is deceptively fruit-
ful; many are now question-
ing the usefulness of ousting
the Taliban if the conditions
for terrorism are reappear-
ing.
Three years on, Afghanistan
is assessing if the benefits of
the opium trade outweigh the
risk of a new Taliban. Though
much of their income is from
foreign aid, Afghanistan
still relies heavily on opium
harvesting to fund infra-
structure, development and
education. However, this is
exactly where the dilemma
for Afghanistan comes in:
if more warlords enter and
rule the country, the develop-
ment of Afghanistan and the
democracy that the West has
been trying to achieve will be
lost yet again.
Inhalers: notorious sources of Serevent, a drug now found to mildly inhibit average blood pressure
Latest
from the
Square
Mile
DrKW stays
DrKW, the investment bank-
ing arm of Dresdner Bank
AG, a subsidiary of the Allianz
Group, reported operating
profits of 162m euros in the
six months ending in June.
Although down 40%, and hav-
ing been approached by three
interested parties, the Allianz
Group does not intend to sell
DrKW for a cash injection but
is looking for a partner to
align its strategy correctly
with the industry.
Asset-backed bonds
New issues in Asset Backed
Securities have risen signifi-
cantly as a result of increased
consumer spending power
and eager lenders. The
$660bn issuance, of which
ABB’s accounts for $430bn, is
increasingly worrying to the
Fed as it reveals the depth to
which the average US con-
sumer is in debt.
Chaudhry’s ratings
A new credit ratings agency
introduced earlier this week
has changed its position on
AstraZenica from hold to buy.
Although Astra has been hit
hard by Dr Graham’s findings
(see main article), I changed
the rating because of the
increased drug trade from
Afghanistan. An increase in
heroin in the economy implies
a surge in drug abuse and
hence in medical services.
Since the medical services
use pharmaceutical compa-
nies as their primary source
of medical, you can expect
Astra’s sales to rise and so
will their share price!
