Imperial Men’s 3rd 3
London Met Men’s 2nd 0
By Adam Williams
A new season brings a new
brand of sexy football from
Imperial Thirds. Shatters’
dream was now being played
out by a team of highly tal-
ented performers.
The newest opponents
to stand up to the Thirds
were London Metropolitan
Seconds. Although they had
lost a couple of games in our
BUSA group, we knew this
wasn’t going to be an easy
ride.
There was barely a hair’s
breadth between the teams in
first 20 minutes. The Imperial
midfield looked strong with
John and Has battling like
warriors and Adam showing
touches of unparalleled maj-
esty. Eventually the break we
needed came when Caruso
with his huge thighs played
the ball to John who delight-
fully clipped it into the right
hand channel for Leon to run
onto. Leon’s low hard cross
found the ever willing runner
John three yards out to score
with an easy finish.
The two flying wingers
Hideki and Leon were caus-
ing the Met defence all sorts
of problems and the spear-
head of the attack, John Scott,
was as strong as ever holding
the ball up and bringing oth-
ers into play. He did, how-
ever, miss a sitter from one
yard out after Leon had again
probed their defence before
crashing a shot against the
cross-bar. Luckily for John
he was called offside so his
blushes were saved.
The second half started with
early pressure from London
Met, but Imperial soon took
control of the game with tri-
angles applenty in midfield,
with full backs Jan and Tom
wanting some of the sexy
footballing action. Caruso
was solid at the back, James
looked like a king amongst
men in goal with awesome
dominance of his area, and
Shatters was just handballing
at every opportunity, although
he too was awesome.
The second goal came after
a foul on Caruso during the
mêlée at a corner brought a
penalty. Ever the gentleman,
Adam let Hideki calmly roll
the ball into the bottom cor-
ner for two-nil.
A substitution brought off
John and on came Perry to
cause their tiring defence
even more problems. A big
kick from the superb James
was killed dead by Perry
before a mazy run flummoxed
their defender. He then curled
the ball into the far corner to
make it 3-0.
All in all this was a fantastic
day for the thirds who could
now go out and celebrate on
the Hammy Ten pub crawl.
Carnage.

Firsts hold off
George’s for victory

Women’s 2nd 38
Imperial Women’s 1st 40
By Erika Kennington
Another Monday, another
match for the Firsts. But
unlike our first two ULU
matches of this season (where
we have been thrashed by the
top two sides in our league)
we had a genuine chance of
scoring our first points.
Our opponents were St
Georges Seconds, who we
narrowly beat by four goals
last season, and we were
determined to not give them
their revenge.
Having had an extra train-
ing session against a local
team, we were feeling qui-
etly confident. We got off to
the best start possible in the
first quarter, with textbook
moves and well rehearsed
play quickly translating into
a six goal lead. George’s were
literally left standing as we
played some near-perfect
netball.
Unfortunately this couldn’t
last, and their quarter-time
team talk resulted in some
very harsh tactics – double
marking BOTH our shooters,
so that the slightest move-
ment (even to adjust a skirt),
led to a ‘contact’ and a free
pass to their team. Still, we
didn’t let this get to us, kept
the defence tight, and held
them to a draw in the second
quarter, keeping our six goal
lead intact.
For some unknown reason,
double marking tactics were
dropped in the third quarter
(hey – we’re not complain-
ing), allowing us to play our
own game, take control and
double our lead. There was
awesome shooting, beauti-
ful interceptions, and some
amazing set-pieces from the
whole team – it was just a
shame we had no audience to
appreciate it!
So with a 12 goal lead, we
knew the match was ours
for the taking in the last
quarter, but we also knew
that we couldn’t afford to
be too confident (for those
of you not familiar with the
game, a ten goal deficit can
quickly be made up in about
five minutes, and unfortu-
nately a quarter is 15 minutes
long!)
Sadly, Georges also realised
this and set about like a team
possessed. I’m ashamed to
say that we nearly cracked!
As the minutes counted
down, so did our lead. Double-
marking returned, we lost our
rhythm, and George’s picked
up on every single mistake
we made, punishing it with
some flawless shooting.
With our lead down to two
goals, we finally decided to
do something about it, and
eventually got the ball mov-
ing up the court once more.
Some great shooting under
pressure form Sam and Jen
ensured that we hung onto
our three points as the final
whistle went.
Although everyone played
well, special mention must go
to JJ, newly promoted from
the Seconds and voted man
of the match in her first game
with us. Finally I’d like to say
a huge well done to the whole
team – we did it!

Chichester Men’s 1st 14
Imperial Men’s 1st 39
By David Jackson
The long sleepy journey
to the south coast left the
Imperial Men’s First XV feel-
ing a little jaded, however the
metaphorical cobwebs were
soon shaken off as they faced
off against the tyrannical
horde of University College
Chichester (UCC).
Within the first few min-
utes, Imperial had made
their intentions known, as the
enigma that is Jon Spencer
glided through a hapless
defence following a well
rehearsed line-out. Secondly,
Simple Simon Smith skilfully
scampered, scoring superbly.
Minutes later he doubled his
tally, showing incisive rapidity
and 20:20 peripheral vision.
UCC’sonlyreplieswerepen-
alties. A dark cloud descended
however, as Marcus Wills was
the recipient of a yellow card;
shamefully he trudged from
the arena a broken dejected
man. Good defence from
Imperial kept the half time
score at 25-9.
Without speaking hyperboli-
cally, insufficient superlatives
exist to describe Imperial’s
second half performance. The
‘angelic’ Gabriel rounded off
a superb move where Andrew
Towers et al showed intense
pace, intelligent hands and
integrity in the face of adver-
sity.
Raphael added his brush
strokes of genius to the
Imperial canvas and dem-
onstrated his full palette of
skills, evading tackles from
the UCC forwards and scor-
ing two tries.
Spencer’s metronomic boot
was on song, converting 83.3%
of tries. Other noteworthy per-
formances came from Alex
O’Rourke, Rich Aung, and the
omnipresent Achi, captain
for the first time. Man of the
match Rich Williams tearfully
proclaimed the day the happi-
est of his short Welsh life.

Imperial Women’s 2nd 15
The Seconds played their
third match of the season
against Queen Mary’s third
team. All the girls came closer
together as a team and played
fantastically, celebrating their
second win with a score of 15-
7! Well done girlies!
We arrived at the courts
after walking through quite a
scary park to find that the only
available dressing area was
the men’s changing room...
hmm! Well, it was better than
changing outside!
Doing drills helped us keep
warm for the rough half hour
we had to wait before playing.
The match itself got off to
a great start, with our star
shooter Alex scoring four
goals before Queen Mary
even got on the score sheet!
The match play was superb
and the girls were on top
form! A special well done to
Jen for being a brave bunny
after her nasty fall, cutting
her hand yet still playing on!
Creditmustalsobeawarded
to Alison and Chiara for their
amazing defending, particu-
larly Chiara for stepping in
as GD – who knew such a
short girl could stretch so
far!! However, Alison, what
a feisty little devil you are...
watch out London, you don’t
want to be on the other side
of her during a toss up!
Team spirit was high
throughout the entire match,
even though QM were getting
a teeny helpful boost from a
certain someone with a whis-
tle! Congratulations to JJ for
being voted woman of the
match for the second time.

Imperial Women’s 1st 7
Queen Mary
Women’s 1st 3
By Alex McCredie
On a cold and wet Sunday
morning, the Imperial ladies’
football team came out for an
exciting match against their
old rivals Queen Mary.
Within eight minutes of
kick off, Queen Mary scored,
putting Imperial into attack-
ing mode after it was evident
that they could do better. The
defence swiftly put the ball
up and Morwena in midfield
took it dashing in from the
left and neatly curled an
equaliser from outside the
box straight into the net.
Queen Mary hadn’t given
up just yet and stunningly
scored ten minutes later,
putting them 2-1 up. Imperial
were not to be outdone when
the club captain, Kathy, came
storming through with the
ball down the middle and
knocked the ball just over
the posts. Jessica, the new-
est import from the Orange
County, California skilfully
took the ball out of midfield,
dodged through their raging
defence and shot at an amaz-
ingly acute angle to hit the
crossbar. Seconds later she
did it again and it went in.
The Imperial defence
worked very hard to clear
the ball after it was back with
Queen Mary. Maew headed
the ball out, it was brought
back in and then speedy
Guilles got there first and
cleared it over Queen Mary
upfield. Aysha received it at
the halfway line, outpaced all
of the defence and nipped
it in the bottom right-hand
corner. With two minutes
to go until half time, incred-
ibly there was time for a
fourth for Imperial. Aysha
and Poppy had control of the
ball, skimming it past defend-
ers. Aysha scored 30 seconds
before the whistle.
Imperial’s spirits were
up and Aysha ran with the
ball straight down the mid-
dle and passed to Poppy who
smashed one in 15 minutes
before the end. Queen Mary
were still trying, but Alex,
Guilles and Kath blocked
their way. Rim, the goalie,
with her cool head, smartly
picked up a few stray balls.
Five minutes before the end
Imperial knew that they
were safe, juggling the ball
between themselves. The
defence pushed up, Maew
ballooned a high one up-front
and Aysha scored a drop goal
to complete her hat-trick and
secure the Imperial ladies’
7-3 victory.
Although everyone on the
Imperial team made a strong
contribution, the ‘dame of
the game’ was Morwena
Marshall for scoring her first
goal for Imperial after years
as an amazing defender.
Football ladies secure victory
