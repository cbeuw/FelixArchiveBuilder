Imperial Men’s 3rd 5
Holloway Men’s 2nd 0
By Leon Thorne
After a fine win in the pre-
vious game against London
Met, the Thirds’ focus was
turned to the vital encoun-
ter with Holloway Seconds.
Winning this would mean
leading our ULU league,
but more importantly beat-
ing the team most despised
(excluding the medics) by any
Imperial footballer.
The game almost failed to
take place, with Holloway
trying their best to have it
postponed before eventually
turning up an hour late. This
should have resulted in a for-
feit, but ever the gentleman,
captain Shatters offered to
play a shortened game of 40
minute halves.
When the match finally
kicked off, it soon became
apparent that this wasn’t the
standard of opposition we
were expecting. Holloway
were missing some key play-
ers, and despite a quiet first
15 minutes a good win was on
the cards.
The first goal came after
Leon ran into the box and cut
the ball back, leaving John
Scott with the simplest of two
yard finishes. John however
had other things in mind, and
in a moment of genius played
a pass off the crossbar into the
path of Tom Trump. Although
his finish wasn’t as stylish as
the pass to find him, Tom
managed to beat the ‘keeper
and make it 1-0.
The Scott’s creative play in
front of goal was a continued
threat all game, with goal-
keeper and defenders always
kept guessing as to how he
would avoid scoring.
The second goal came after
a pass back to the goalkeeper.
The indirect free kick was
played off by Hideki for Leon
to drill low into the corner.
Despite some further pres-
sure, Imperial failed to score
a third before half time and
went in 2-0 up.
During the break, Shatters
was forced into a substitution,
Has refusing to play on due to
the continual monkey noises
being made by Tim and Adam.
Although the sounds were not
at all racially motivated and in
fact part of a primitive mating
ritual between the pair, the
substitution was made and
Perry was brought on.
The second half started
poorly, with the Thirds allow-
ing Holloway to play more
freely and have a short spell
of pressure. Shatters and
Caruso were forced into
some last ditch tackles and
‘big kicks’, however this didn’t
last long.
Perry scored his fifth of the
season after some good work
from Hideki. The fourth goal
came soon after with a nicely
worked team move. James
quickly rolled the ball out to
Leon who brought it up the
wing before playing it into
John. Perry then held off his
man before sliding a pass
across for Leon to slot into
the far corner.
The fifth and final goal
came with ten minutes to
go, Hideki again providing
a nicely clipped ball across
the box, which was firmly
directed home by the head
of Adam.
The game finished with the
defence pleased to have kept
a clean sheet and protected
goalkeeper James from hav-
ing to make a save. Despite
this, a better overall perform-
ance will be essential for the
next match, against Bucks
Chilterns.
