Felix reports back on the wonderfully relaxed Spanish festival experience
that is Festival Internaçional de Benicàssim

LIVE REVIEW
This reviewer starts in the ancient
Spanish city of Girona, inland from
the Costa Dorada. The date is
August 4, 2004. Primarily host to sun,
booze and sex seekers from around
Europe with aims to satisfy all these
demands during the course of a two
week bender, I was able to add live
music to my list, for I was starting
my second trip down the coast to
one of the greatest, and certainly
the most civilised music festival in
Europe: Festival Internaçional de
Benicàssim, known by the abbrevia-
tion-mad Spanish as FIB.
Radiohead, Björk, the Cure, Blur
and Moby are just a few of the
essential live acts which have hon-
oured FIB with their music over the
ten years of its existence. With this
fine track record, the tenth anni-
versary of the festival was not to be
overlooked. The decidedly mediter-
ranean FIB organisers were several
months later than their European
rivals in updating their 2003 festi-
val website to a 2004 website, and
even more fashionably late with the
confirmed band line-up. This did
not deter me from booking a couple
of 120 euro tickets for the five day
weekend beach party.
Heading down from Girona air-
port, having spent around two quid
on budget flights, my girlfriend,
her girlfriend and I followed the
Costa Dorada and Costa Brava on
our way to my favourite, the Costa
Blanca. Relying on buses, trains
and coaches, we eventually reached
Benicàssim via Tarragona and
Castellón de la Plana, both worth at
least a flying visit.
Benicàssim, 100km north of
Valencia, was once upon a time a
holiday place for the higher ranks of
Spanish society, offering them empty
beaches, clear sea views, and a spot
of social climbing. Not so today. The
sea front is a concrete nightmare,
the views are eclipsed for all but the
newest tower block, and there’s not
even a sniff of the smart Valenciano
socialites.
This is irrelevant, for Benicàssim
is the perfect canvas for such crea-
tivity that hits it during the festival
period. From early August, the town
warms up with a fashion, a film
and a fringe theatre festival, during
which the FIB goers arrive to get
good value from their ten-day camp-
ing passes. For those festivalgoers
for whom domestic facilities have
always been an issue, rest assured
that there will be no problems in
Benicàssim. Over the years, three
purpose-built camping zones have
been created around the town, in
small woody areas. Each site has
yet more concrete blocks housing
permanent toilets, showers, a bar
and food stands. Most of the camp-
ing areas are shaded by the forest’s
thick canopy. This is of great relief,
as I am convinced that in direct sun-
light, the campers would die and the
tents would melt.
Musically, this year’s line-up was
slightly more obscure than in years
before, and designed for the open-
minded music lover. Had we not
arrived too late for Thursday night’s
pre-party, we would have caught Ash
opening the festival. Not to be, as we
also missed Felix da Housecat, an
American DJ better known on the
continent than here in Britain. Most
days at Benicàssim begin with rock
bands from around 5pm, with head-
liners coming on close to midnight.
The bands give way to DJs who play
well into the morning. The last DJs
come on at 6am, but this is Spanish
time!
Friday night started late evening
with Kings of Leon and Snow Patrol,
finishing up with headliners Air
and the originators of electronica,
Kraftwerk. The German group’s lat-
est stage show features four guys
in suits fiddling with their laptops.
Whatever was going on in the
Kraftwerk machines was resulting
in electronica with flawless atten-
tion to detail, timed and mixed to
perfection. The digital graphics in
the screen show were in everyway
as tasteful and experimental as
the original tracks such as 1975’s
Autobahn and 1983’s Tour de France
still seemed today.
On Saturday evening the Scissor
Sisters did their stuff in one of
the tents. I am not a huge fan of
their first record, but in Spain they
caught the festival crowd just at
the right time for a pickup, as they
did at Glasto, and set the ball roll-
ing for a memorable evening spent
with the likes of Soulwax, Teenage
Fanclub, and a revitalised Primal
Scream. Lou Reed took the main
slot on Saturday. With a low key
five piece band, including the inspi-
rational cellist Jane Scarpantoni,
Reed had reworked and in several
cases slowed down his old tracks,
such as Walk On The Wild Side and
the Perfect Day. His set list was
laced with material from last year’s
album, Raven. All was carried off
with reliability and professionalism
from an artist whose passionate and
personal song writing has enriched
creativity in the music industry for
over 30 years.
British retro rockers Franz
Ferdinand were one of the big
names of Sunday night, but more
inspiring were the shows from old
timers Brian Wilson and Lambchop.
Lambchop ooze personality and built
up an extraordinarily close relation-
ship with the crowd, inducing a good
half-hour encore. How refreshing it
was to see the band packing away
their own gear at the end of the gig!
Chemical Brothers were headlining,
and they did not disappoint, manag-
ing to squeeze every last drop of
enthusiasm out of their crowd.
So, is it all about the music? Yes
and no. On Monday night, 2 Many
DJs and some noteworthy others
played out the festival on Benicàssim
beach. As you look around the party,
the international side of FIB is noth-
ing but fascinating. This year, in
addition to some extremely friendly
señorsandseñoritas,ImetGermans,
Italians, plenty of French and loads
of English. People who have been or
played at FIB know how special it is.
It was once described by Huey of the
Fun Lovin’ Criminals as ‘the most
chilled out festival in the world’.
In publicising FIB, I am probably
breaking some term or condition, as
it remains a secret for many people.
However, it would be more of a crime
if I were to lie low, as Benicàssim
proved this year, for the tenth time,
that it is an essential date in the
diary of world-class music events.

SINGLE REVIEWS
It’s not that often that you come
across music that just makes you sit
and giggle. When you do, though, it’s
a terribly uplifting experience.
The Mad Staring Eyes are a four-
some from North London who com-
bine manically intelligent lyrics, laid-
back guitars and bizarre humour
into deceptively simple rock that
is, frankly, completely and utterly
bonkers.
With spacey melodies harking
back to David Bowie and occasional
thumping bass lines and delicious-
ly weird phrases reminiscent of
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, they
embrace eclecticism with refresh-
ing abandon, standing out from the
bland morass of current fashionable
rock bands with their sheer pecu-
liarity. A hint of politics and a good
dose of irreverence make it all up
into a fascinating and unpredictable
experience that is never quite what
it seems.
Sometimes morose but always wry
and ironic, amusing and enlighten-
ing but just a little grubby, The Mad
Staring Eyes are a fun-loving bunch
that will take you on a thoroughly
enjoyable ride and have you coming
straight back for more.

● The Mad Staring Eyes will
be playing in dBs on 4 Decem-
ber, as part of a RockSoc gig
night. Get down there and
check them out
The Polyphonic Spree are fantastic.
This song is fantastic (despite being
two years old if you’ve seen them
live in that time).
As well as being in two thousand
places at once, this song tries to
do two thousand things at once.
They’re singing about nothing new,
but who would want 25 people moan-
ing about the Manchester weather?
Somehow bands are lumbered
with the default setting of ‘depress-
ing’, like it’s cool to be in despair.
Against this musical landscape, the
Polyphonic Spree do the brave thing
and embrace all that is brilliant
about life. This can be daunting, but
somehow the Spree make you feel
as if you can rise to the challenge.
The B-side, The Best Part, is again
upbeat but a bit long considering
that the A-side accomplishes its task
in 150 seconds less time.
The faithful cover of Happy Xmas
(War Is Over) is pretty and includes
a children’s choir. But at a time when
a bank balance is being tried, do
we need reminding that Christmas
is just round the corner? Oh, and
Bush was re-elected, so no way is
war over. The Spree fail to make an
imprint in the song, but it’s always
hard to do that with the greats.
