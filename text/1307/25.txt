‘Tis brillig again. Thanks to Karen
for providing a solution to my
last puzzle, and to all of you who
tried but couldn’t complete it. This
week, 10 across portends some dif-
ficulties for her, involving certain
birds of prey, if one is to trust the
context.
This is probably an appropriate
moment to warn you all against
trusting the apparent meaning of
clues. In particular, beware 1 across
and 3 down. I also feel I should
confess to having used the some-
what obscure abbreviation AC (ante
Christum) instead of the usual BC
(before Christ). Hope to hear from
you! Jabberwock
Felix Crossword 1307 by Jabberwock
FUCWITs
It looks like the Management
Slackers are storming into a bit of a
lead here, purely by virtue of having
entered more times than the rest of
you. As much as we here at Coffee
Break are all for equal opportuni-
ties, we are going to have to start
docking the Slackers some marks
beacuse of their close ties to Felix;
so come on Smith & Wesson, as their
closest rival you need to do your
best to close the gap (there’s some
easy points to be got this week, plus
Slackers have been banned from
entering last week’s football quiz
as they were present when we cre-
ated it)!
This week:
Word Matching: One point for
each correct answer
International Beats: One point
for each artist and one for each title
Cryptograms: One point for each
correct answer
Whose Face? 10 points if it’s you
and you have evidence to prove it

Here’s something nice and easy for you (and us – virtaually no time consumption doing this one, plus it fills a
shedload of space) to think about while you’re daydreaming in lectures. I think the premise is straightforward
enough, so no explaination needed. Some of them are really easy, but we hope the others will keep you
pondering for a little longer...
