Some of you may be rather scepti-
cal about the sixth instalment from
Pixar Studios. The past five offer-
ings, the Toy Story movies, A Bug’s
Life, Monsters Inc and Finding
Nemo have all had similar formulae.
The Incredibles has something else
to offer though, another dimension
to it.
It was a big gamble on Pixar’s
part to bring in former Simpsons
director Brad Bird. This is the first
submission from Pixar that has used
only ‘human’ characters and breaks
the mould of mismatched buddies
and road trip formula. Pixar cannot
seem to put a foot wrong though.
Once again, they have created a
visual marvel, laced with intelligent
humour that should, and will, appeal
to the masses.
The Incredibles tells the story of
Mr Incredible, aka Bob Parr (Craig
T Nelson), who is one of many super-
heroes. That is until Mr Incredible
catches a suicidal jumper who is
less than grateful, leading to a wave
of lawsuits and legal compensa-
tions that make superheroes unwel-
come. The Government is forced
to intervene and run a Superhero
Relocation Program, so that they
can all lead normal and anonymous
lives. They become another face in
the crowd.
Several years down the line,
Bob and Helen, formerly Elastigirl
(Holly Hunter), live in suburbia hell
raising three children: Dash (who
can run at the speed of light), Violet
(who can turn invisible and form
force fields) and Jack Jack (not even
potty trained), while trying to fit to
the norm.
All is not what it seems though.
Bob is desperately unhappy is his
mediocre and immoral monkey-suit
job, unable to help anyone without
his bureaucratic pen-pushing boss
breathing down his neck. Dash is
itching to use his gifts in a com-
petitive nature. Violet is depressed,
finding it hard to find her place in
high school and feels, quite literally,
like the invisible girl. Meanwhile,
Helen is stressed, working hard to
keep her family constrained to nor-
mality and trying to keep her hus-
band in check from returning to his
old lifestyle.
One day, out of the blue, Mr
Incredible receives a mysterious
call, offering the chance to play the
good guy again...
The Incredibles is another exam-
ple of Pixar’s mastery of popular
animation. This is family entertain-
ment at its best. However, it does
seem to lack the innocence of Toy
Story or Monsters Inc and isn’t as
magical as Finding Nemo. This is
probably because it is a story about
human beings (of sorts) who do
have a loose connection with this
reality.
The heroes themselves aren’t
highly original. Frozone (Samuel L
Jackson) is the most obvious refer-
ence (Iceman). There are links to
The Fantastic Four, The Flash and
Captain America. There are also
references to James Bond movies,
with the island hideout of the villain
Syndrome (Jason Lee) synonymous
with various Bond baddies. Edna
(Brad Bird) is also a reference to Q
and Syndrome to Dr No.
The comedy is intelligent; some of
you maybe surprised at how smart
this movie is. In particular, The
Incredibles answers the age-old
question of ‘cape or no cape?’ with
an amusing monologue from Edna
about how dangerous capes really
are. The script is well written and
delivered. The voice casting is ade-
quate but not ‘incredible’. Frozone
is the best cast out of all of them.
Perhaps some bigger names would
have added nicely to a movie that
has visual appeal and intelligence.
The running time is rather long,
with some parts of the film slightly
dragging, though not peripheral, as
the background history is needed
to understand each characters tor-
ment.
The visuals really are breath-
taking at times, in particular the
detailed fluids and dazzling light.
The sheen and textures are simply
astounding.
The Incredibles is a different offer-
ing from Pixar. It is markedly more
mature in tone and approach, and
should be highly enjoyable for all
generations, male and female.

A different kind of family vacation
Who will walk away? Perhaps our reviewer should have
Diamonds are a girl’s best friend,
and they most definitely are Pierce
Brosnan’s. A diamond master thief,
Max Burdett (Brosnan) has never
been caught. He has the best moves
and the best alibis. His girlfriend
Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek) is his
accomplice in disguise. With only
one of the Napoleon diamonds left
to be stolen, the couple retire to the
Bahamas where they can have any-
thing. They are multimillionaires
after all.
An ocean liner has docked on the
Bahamas displaying the diamond
cruise and the third Napoleon dia-
mond, the only diamond the two
master thieves have allegedly not
stolen. Was this his plan all along?
Was this the set up for his next scam?
Will he achieve his last big score or
continue with boredom in restless
retirement? Not only that, but Max
is being followed by FBI agent Stan
Lloyd (Woody Harrelson). Max has
fooled Stan too many times, and he
won’t be tricked again.
After The Sunset is slicker than
other caper comedies such as
Oceans Eleven; you would have to
expect that with Pearce Brosnan
being cast as the lead. This James
Bond superstar carries all the style
the film needs. He is the perfect dia-
mond thief – like him, they show that
element of sophistication. Diamonds
are an upper class to normal thiev-
ing.
The film is worth watching just for
Salma Hayek’s amazing body, which
is shown off in tiny little bikinis for
a large proportion of the film’s run-
ning time. It looks a lot better than
in her days as Frida.
However, if Brosnan wants to walk
around with his shirt unbuttoned
to try and compete with Hayek, I
suggest he goes to the gym or just
buttons it back up again.
DirectorBrettRatner(RushHour)
has a great eye and the film scenes
were a lot of fun to look at. However,
it seemed like some scenes were
missing. Stan Lloyd fell into the
hands of a local cop (Naomie Harris)
who seemed to be against him from
the moment he appeared and paid
him no attention whatsoever. Then
suddenly she was in love with him.
Did I miss something there?
The story line is fun and enter-
taining; all the characters were well
cast and likable. Woody Harrison’s
goofy comedy humour clicks with
Brosnan’s persona in a strange but
excellent way. When the two are on
screen together they provide all the
laughs of the film.
The film was effortless for Pierce
Brosnan, on a Caribbean Island with
Salma Hayek all over him, and it
showed as he simply fell into the
role. Salema Hayek seemed to be in
the film for a jolt of sex appeal and
little else. They must have had fun
filming the scenes; there were lots
of funny moments.
After The Sunset is forgettable
entertainment. If you have time to
kill, watch this film, or just wait until
it comes out on video.
