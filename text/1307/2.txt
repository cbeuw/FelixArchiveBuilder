I don’t know about you, but I
am getting very weary indeed
of Iraq at the moment and
have consequently not been
reading about it as assiduous-
ly as I should. So this week,
you’re getting hunting, char-
lies and football.
Nobody who picked up a
newspaper or turned on the
TV this week could have failed
to notice that hunting has
finally (almost) been banned.
A nice game of bill ping-pong
was played between the two
Houses of Parliament before
the Speaker of the Commons
finally invoked the Parliament
Act and the Bill was passed.
The Parliament Act is
invoked rarely (usually for
important constitutional
changes and the like) and
was put in place to assert the
power of the Commons over
the Lords. Usually, a bill is
read in the Commons, debat-
ed and then passed or reject-
ed. If passed, it moves to the
second chamber, the Lords,
for discussion. The Lords
then send the bill back to the
Commons with changes to be
made and suggestions.
The Parliament Act over-
rides this process – despite
the Lords voting against ban-
ning hunting last week (but by
a surprisingly small majority),
the bill was still made law by
the Commons. And that was
that – 700 years of hunting
banned. Or was it?
The furious hunt supporters
vowed immediately to take
the fight to the high court. The
Telegraph is a supporter of
their cause and commented
that this was class war com-
bined with another national
trait: “the class warriors
were victorious because they
formed an irresistible alli-
ance with those who labour
under the illusion that foxes
are sweet”. Most newspapers
pointed out the fact that the
vast majority of people in the
country really don’t care one
way or the other about this
issue, finding it a diverting
but ultimately pointless way
to spend time in Parliament.
One Guardian columnist
went so far as to say that he
“couldn’t bear to hear another
word about it”.
Prince Charles also seems
unable to keep himself out of
the papers – for all the wrong
reasons – at the moment. He
was embroiled in another
scandal this week when a
leaked memo he had written
to his staff appeared to sug-
gest that people should know
their place and not aspire to
things of which they are not
capable. Of course, as a man
who has earned every posi-
tion, medal and penny that
he has, and has in no way
been gifted it by Mummy, he
has every right to go spouting
off like this. But did he actu-
ally say that? It appears that
this may have been (surprise
surprise) whipped up by the
tabloids, who scented a sec-
ond juicy class warfare story
of the week.
The memo, it seems, actu-
ally says that young people
should not expect success to
be handed to them without
hard work and a talent for
what they are doing. The Sun
and The Mirror treated it as
an amusing spat between the
Government and the Prince,
whereas The Daily Mail
saw it as a battle between
the Labour party (historically
republican) and the monar-
chy, after the education secre-
tary Charles Clarke criticised
the Prince and called him old-
fashioned.
The Guardian and many
other papers saw nothing
wrong with what the Prince
said, although he obviously
is not the person to say it:
they thought that “some jobs
are better than others; not
everyone will get one of the
good ones. The overwhelm-
ing majority of people will not
find fulfilment through their
jobs. They will find it through
activities outside their jobs, or
friendships within their jobs,
or they will not find it at all.
Expecting otherwise is delu-
sional.”
Thedebateseemstobedying
down now as the Government
are reputedly keen to forget
the whole business, but what
has come out of it is that the
Prince really, really needs to
keep his mouth shut like the
Queen can, and that he also
really, really needs a better
PR team.
Finally, the football. I love
football, have had a season
ticket in England for six
years and did my final year
in Barcelona (where some of
you may remember I wrote an
article about going to a foot-
ball match and being shocked
by the racist chanting). I am
too depressed to write much.
All that occurs to me is yes,
my impression when I lived
there was certainly that the
Spanish are racist, but real-
ly, we are certainly not the
nation who should be casting
the first stone and getting all
self-righteous and moralistic
about it, as the racist abuse
aimed at Dwight Yorke on
Saturday shows.
Foxhunting, football and our future king
Emily Gwyer on the week’s biggest national news stories

The infamous ‘speaker
van’ has returned to South
Kensington, its passengers
pestering Imperial College
students as they attempt to
offload poor quality goods.
The van’s driver and pas-
sengers call students over as
if to ask for directions, claim
that they have had a delivery
of speakers rejected and then
try to sell them at a ‘knock-
down price’.
In the past, the speakers
have been found to be bro-
ken or of very low quality.
According to Felix issue 1248,
buyers were asked to take the
salesmen to cash machines,
and physical threats were
made against those who
refused to make a purchase.
Felix has been made aware
of two independent sightings
of the van, attempting to sell
the speakers to Imperial stu-
dents and graduates, in the
past week. Various differ-
ent vehicles may have been
used.
College Security have
strongly advised students
to stay away from the
van(s) and the passengers.
Unfortunately, very little
action can be taken against
them at present.
