15
By Tim Aplin
Starting from modest
beginnings after being
reinstated last year, ACC
bar nights have become
some of the most eagerly
anticipated events each
term and also one of the
greatest success stories
in many a year.
This term, with sport-
speople ranging from
basketball to boat, from
weights to windsurfing,
from the three karates to
the two kung fus to the
one kickboxing, our belov-
ed Union bars were once
more filled to the rafters
from opening to closing
with students galore!
The concept has always
been simple – you had to
be a member of an ACC
club (ie a sports club for
the non-hacks amongst
you) and for £3 on the
door the free alcohol
flowed until we ran out.
Frequent patrons of the
bar night will testify to the
extraordinary quantities
pre-purchased by the ACC
executive, and the licen-
see on the evening was
quoted as saying “we had
to move another five bar-
rels [approximately 440
pints of lager] for paying
customers because you
drank so much!”
The response this time
was overwhelming! To all
who came along, thank
you! For those who missed
it, shame on you... but fear
not, the laurels are not
being rested on. Plans
are being drawn up, and
I can feel the air tingling
with anticipation already!
By Thursday morning,
rumours were abound
that the next bar night
was going to be on the
last Wednesday of term.
When pressed for details,
the organiser, Morten
Olesen, neither confirmed
nor denied the rumours,
claiming they had been
started and were being
fuelled by certain mem-
bers of staff eager to fol-
low up on the success gen-
erated by the event. He
preferred instead to offer
the following soundbyte to
readers: “I don’t remem-
ber a night like that at
the Union since my first
year!”
It should also be pointed
out that although the beer
was flowing and the bars
were overwhelmed, the
night passed without any
major incidents.
Kudos and applause to
the man of the moment,
Uncle Morten Olesen, for
organising a top-notch
‘gathering of like minded
people’ and giving the
younger students a taste
of what Wednesday nights
should be like.
