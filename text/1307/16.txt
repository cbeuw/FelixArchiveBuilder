ALBUM REVIEW
Nostalgia: ain’t it wonderful? It ena-
bles old artists to come back and
make a killing on rose-tinted memo-
ries. We have seen a deluge of old
artists making comeback albums
this year, getting in on the current
retro trend. So far we’ve had Brian
Wilson of Beach Boys fame releas-
ing his ‘lost’ album, Smile, and
Morrissey doing the rounds with the
rather limp You Are The Quarry.
Now we’ve got Neville Staple, lead
singer with classic seventies ska
band The Specials, returning in the
light of renewed interest in retro
music and the ska movement, with
The Specials’ music being used in
car adverts and the rise of US bands
such as Less Then Jake.
But unlike some recent come-
backs, The Rude Boy Returns is
far from the cheeky cash-in that
some might expect. Instead we
have a collection of music that eas-
ily equals the best material The
Specials recorded. Much of what’s
on offer here is unashamedly poppy,
not unlike 2-Tone disciples Madness
– such as Since You’ve Been Gone,
and ode to enjoying the freedom
of splitting up – but each song is
strengthened by the catchy, woozy
horns (which were a main staple of
a Specials song), and the identifiable
ska rhythms in the guitars.
Refreshingly, there are still songs
that pack a social punch and make
keen observations. Place In Life is
a cynical look at politics and the
lies we are told (“...But if you don’t
believe me, then check the mani-
festo / Just blah blah blah and blah
blah blah / The truth, I don’t think
so!”), whilst Pressure, reminiscent
of The Specials’ Nite Klub, quickly
makes clear that the main character
in the song is a heroin addict.
Surprisingly, a slew of guests
enhances the songs rather then
provides names to advertise them.
Former Damned drummer Rat
Scabies provides the ska beats for
the aforementioned Pressure, and
they also team up with former Clash
guitarist Mick Jones on one of the
standout tracks, Do Nothing, which
is also one of the finest examples of
musical craftsmanship on display.
Clocking in at over seven minutes,
thanks to the layered sections and
tightness of the piece, it remains
a gripping piece of revolution rock
rather then a long winded flop.
Listening to it, you can close your
eyes and immediately transport
yourself to south London, such is
the strength of the song.
The flow of the album is spoilt
by some embarrassing attempts at
dance music. A remix of Lead Belly’s
Cow Cow Yicky comes across as a
dodgy Europop theme, and an ambi-
tious attempt at Indian ska on the
closer Nachna unfortunately boils
down to a dull, by the numbers R&B
record with no personality to it.
These failings can’t detract though
from one of the surprises of the year,
a comeback album that packs as
much punch as one from today’s
young whippersnappers, and with-
out the hype machine spoiling it.
Consider it an essential for ska fans,
old and new alike.

SINGLE REVIEW
Everyone’s felt it – that teenage
angst that makes you slam doors
and throw things at the wall. Most
people grow out of it, but some man-
age to make a career out of it.
Reuben are a strange mix of those
bland, radio-friendly guitar bands
that have sprung up everywhere, the
growling misery of a nu-metal band,
and the chirpy self-destructiveness
of Lit without the chirpiness. With
relentlessly driving guitars, monot-
onously intoned vocals and ever-
present but strangely unobtrusive
rage, they’ve got a formula that will
propel them to temporary fame as
this year’s hottest band – and indeed
is in the process of doing so.
Their lyrics deal with arguments
and misunderstandings, full of a low-
lying lethargic depression that could
go either way, into suicidal grimness
or homicidal madness, and provides
the most fascinating facet of this
two-song album sampler. Catchy but
not particularly memorable, inter-
esting without displaying an awful
lot to be interested in, Reuben play
simplified, gimmick-free rock, and
do it well but without sparkle. You’ll
probably like them. Just not with
any kind of passion.

LIVE REVIEW
In retrospect, it may have been a
little foolhardy to hold the second
RockSoc band night of the term on
the day after bonfire night. Torn
between the twin temptations of an
evening of live rock music and the
many spectacular fireworks displays
on offer in our fair capital, many
people seemed to have gone for
the explosions and pretty colours;
truly, it was a tough choice. Still,
the bands were willing despite the
sparse crowd, and those who made
the effort got their money’s worth.
Despite a shaky start – nerves
seeming to get the better of them
at times – Imperial’s very own Jazz
and Rock Society band, The Phly,
delivered an enjoyable set. Laid
back and jazzy, they played simple
but effective rock that brought to
mind the White Stripes without the
gimmicks. With beefy, murky nuanc-
es and female vocals that were rich
and strong once they got going,
there was more than a hint of delta
blues. Although it began to drag
towards the end and the audience
remained resolutely unmoved by
all enthusiastic overhead clapping
and soulful kneeling down, we can
look forward to good things from
The Phly. Once they get themselves
some confidence.
Only Joe were of the ripped-jeans-
and-messy-hair school of bouncy
punk that isn’t always quite as
wacky as it thinks it is. Displaying
outlandish instruments from turnta-
bles to a clarinet, they sounded like
a fuzzy and uncoordinated version of
Madness, perky but inefficient and
slightly confused. Entertainment
value was gained by the untimely
death of the bass guitar – leading to
a brief instrumental interlude while
another was procured from the next
band – but their seeming inability to
sing in tune with each other dragged
it all back down. Full marks for the
home-made banner, though.
The pattern of random destruc-
tion was continued when part of
the PA system exploded during Gin
Panic’s set, but they rose above it
admirably. Purveying funky, pure-
bred rock music, like the Red Hot
Chili Peppers only harder and with-
out the stupid noises, they were
tight, smooth and exciting. Complete
with crazy, standing-on-the-drum
kit antics, they managed to com-
bine spacey, prog-like melodies and
nasal, Muse-esque vocals into a sur-
prising mix that really rather rocked
out. They were interesting, engag-
ing and as hard to describe as they
were to ignore.
Victims of Noise are aiming for
the stars, but they do fall a bit
short for now. They worked hard
– and indeed played hard – but it
all seemed rather forced at times.
Rock tinged with punk, they relied
on fast riffs and loud shouting along
with manic pogoing and semi-nudity.
It was all danceable enough, in a
Rage Against The Machine sort of
way, but they came across as the
sort of band who get their postures
and poses all sorted out before they
start on the music. All completely
inoffensive and likeable, but lacking
in any real substance.
So, the bands ranged in quality but
a generally good time was had by
all. A cheap, cheerful opportunity to
experience live music in your very
own students’ union. Next month,
if there aren’t any fireworks, you
should come along.
