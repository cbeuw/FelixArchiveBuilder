Hello, and welcome again! There were
quite a few answers to RSA Magna,
which was pleasing. However, a lot of
you seemed to think the answer to (d)
was ‘George Bush’ when it was clearly
his son, with a ‘W’. Spelling problems,
maybe?

Coffee Break is back for another week, and Imperial is finally starting to loosen up,

International Beats
The Chesire’s Cat Cryptic Corner Whose is this god damn beautiful face?
Hello there my love-
ly ladies and gen-
tleman. Miss Suzy
Backhouse went on
a little trip to the
AVS sports night
at the Union last
Wednesday and look
what she found. Yes
youlittle piss-heads,
look at you, its a dis-
grace. Imperial peo-
ple having fun and
getting drunk. This
is just wrong.
However, it hap-
pens and I caught
you in action. So, girl
in the circle, email
us and tell us who
you are with some
kind of proof, and
you can get points,
and a kiss from El
Vino if you’re lucky.
Or me, if you’re that
way inclined.
This week we’re bringing you a little
lyrics quiz. Of course, just printing
out some lyrics for you to guess
would be far too easy, as you could
just get them off the web, like we did.
So, befitting an international college
like Imperial, we’ve translated the
lyrics into various languages and
then back into English, with hilari-
ous (well, not quite) results. We’ll
give you the language we translated
it into, and a clue too. There are
eight songs, with a point for each
correct title, and a point for each
artist.
Russian
I am a thin Shadow, yes, I am a
real Shadow
All of you Thin Shadys only imitate
another,
So a habit very thin Shadow please
rise,
Please rise, please rise
CLUE: Blond haired ‘gangster’
doesn’t want anyone to get mis-
taken for him
Spanish
You were my sun
You were my land
But you did not know I wanted
yourself completely, did not
So you took an opportunity
And did other plans
But I bet you did not think that
they would come to collide down-
ward, not
Ex-boyband star, who’s a whole
lot more credible since he left. A fea-
ture of girly calendars everywhere
French
Woman
To agree with me tonight
‘cos my sensation
Is just right
As us dance
By the moonlight
Be able to not see
You are my pleasure
A one-hit wonder for a French
band with plenty of sexual magnet-
ism, this still fills up cheesy dance-
floors everywhere
German
Therefore if you are solitary,
you know that I wait here for you,
I’m only a crosshair
I’m only a shot away of you.
And if you leave here
You left me, had broken, splin-
tered, lie
I’m only a crosshair
I’m only a shot, and then we die
Critically acclaimed Scottish
band’s second single, released early
this year
Dutch
Look around you, not in the sun
Now you know that your times
come
And they said that it never for you
would come
And oh my friend that you have
not changed
You have rough looks and live
strange
And I know that a taste for it you
also have gotten
More of a soap opera than a band,
they still find time to release great
singles like this, in between bur-
gling each others homes and being
crackheads
Norwegian
I at one time got a girl
Or I ought to say she at one time
got me
She displayed me her location
Isn’t it a great Norwegian tree?
She asked me to be
And she said to me sit anywhere
So I saw around
And I commented there wasn’t a
chair
A band that changed the world
back in the sixties, this is from
their 1965 album. The clue’s in the
language...
Italian
A heart that’s saturated
Similar to a landfill
A spot that slowly murders you
Bruise that won’t recover
I’ll take a dispassionate life
a handshake nor carbon monox-
ide
neither alarms nor surprises
Often derided as being miserable
and depressing, this song is from
their third album, rated by plenty of
people as the best ever
Latin
We were tender we were wrong
We were correct always
If you wish there was someone to
say me upon
She’s one
When you obtain from where you
wanna go
And you occupy occurrence you
wanna occupy
You’re smiling
When you said to anyone you
wanna make known
And you occupy the road you
wanna run riot on
Yeah
You’ll emerge so high you’ll
emerge winged
Probably the most loved and hated
performer on the British music
scene around, this song’s video was
a figure skating parody
FUCWIT Answers:
Issue 1305
There were four quizzes that week,
none of them particularly difficult,
so I’m surprised you guys didnt do
any better. Anyway, answers...
Cryptic Corner: RSA Magna
Tony Blair PM, Virginia Bottomley,
Margret Thatcher, George W Bush.
Goonies never say die!
The Goonies rocked, so so much.
It’s a landmark peice of film-mak-
ing, right up there with other eight-
ies classics, Back to the Future,
Honey, I shrunk the kids! and Dirty
Dancing. If you’ve not seen these,
please, go to Blockbuster, now! The
answers were, in order:
Mama Fratelli, Mouth, Brandon,
Mikey, Chunk, and the Imperial
favourite, Data.
The Blair Film Project
Does anybody trust this guy any-
more? The fact that he played a
neo-nazi in film number 6 here is
probably a major clue. He’s proab-
ably a nice chap though, if a little
creepy. Answers then:
1. The Matrix, Carrie-Ann Moss
2. Austin Powers, Mike Myers
3. Fight Club, Brad Pitt
4. Ms Congeniality, Sandra Bullock
5. The Godfather, Al Pacino
6. American History X, Ed Norton
