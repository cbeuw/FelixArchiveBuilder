Wars go away, paranoia remains
Several strong performances that are worthy of Oscars, but ultimately let down by an
implausible plot
The Manchurian Candidate is a
remake starring Denzel Washington
as an ex-army major who is pushed
to the limits of sanity to bring a
high level government conspiracy
to justice.
During the Gulf war in the early
nineties, Major Ben Marco’s
unit came under attack. Marco
(Washington) was knocked uncon-
scious, but Sergeant Raymond Shaw
(Liev Schreiber) manages to sin-
gle-handedly kill all the ambushers.
Years later Shaw, now a war hero,
is running for the vice-presidential
nomination and uses his apparently
heroic actions as political capital.
But things are not quite right: Major
Ben Marco’s growing uneasiness
about what actually happened in
Iraq leads him to uncover a web
of deceit involving a major multi-
national corporation, brainwashing,
and (and this is my favourite line in
the film) “rich people funding bad
science to put a sleeper in the White
House”.
It’s a testament to Denzel
Washington’s acting ability that they
decided to name the capital of the
United States and a state on the
east coast after him. As he has done
in films such as Malcolm X and
Training Day, Washington tears up
the screen with another effortlessly
convincing performance. However,
the best acting comes from Liev
Schreiber, who tears up the screen,
puts it in a shredder and uses the
pieces to make a papier mâché
Oscar, which I daresay is sitting on
his mantelpiece right now.
This is a deeply political film.
Perhaps not overtly political like
Fahrenheit 911, it uses the medium
of fictional representation to address
very similar issues. In many ways,
The Manchurian Candidate is a
far stronger critique of American
democracy than Fahrenheit 911 was.
What appears on the surface to be a
smoothly run democracy disguises
layers and layers of corruption and
propaganda. In The Manchurian
Candidate, appearances are always
deceptive and with minute-by-
minute twists there is very little you
can take for granted.
At the same time, what lets the
film down is the plot. It’s not so much
Michael Moore as Mickey Mouse.
Even your most ardent conspiracy
theorist would pass this one off as
‘a bit over the top’. Although real-
ism has never been a core value for
Hollywood, a degree of ‘suspension
of disbelief’ is required so that the
audience can stay on the ride. It all
seems so unnecessarily elaborate –
for example, why does Manchurian
Global go to all this trouble with
brainwashing and microchip brain
implants when it could just bribe
everyone with money or position. By
applying Occam’s Razor to this film,
you’ll quickly realise that it has a big
gaping hole right in the middle of it.
In this day and age, it is good to
come across a film that has a politi-
cal message. It took Hollywood sev-
eral years after the Vietnam debacle
before it started making anti-war
movies like Full Metal Jacket and
Apocalypse Now. Hopefully in the
next few years we will see more
films that scrutinise the American
political system and try to address
the madness going on in Iraq.
At this stage, however, many of us
are sick of hearing about the likes of
George Bush, Halliburton, and the
War on Terror – for people who have
had enough of these issues, this is
not a film for you. However, if you
like your conspiracy theories fast,
furious and downright implausible
then The Manchurian Candidate is
the film to see this weekend.

Being Julia could win Bening Oscars
To begin with, I went to a Friday
late night show of Being Julia with
a couple of my friends. We were
the only ones in the theatre! As you
would imagine, this was not at all
encouraging. However, I did watch
the movie without switching off my
mobile phone! Add this to the first
thirty minutes of a boring start of
the movie during which the main
characters were introduced, and
you would have to try hard not to
fall asleep. However, this boredom
was soon washed away.
The movie is based around the
funny novella written by W Somerset
Maugham. Being Julia is about
a theatre actress, Julia Lambert
(Annette Bening), going through a
mid-life crisis. She is married to
a great director Michael Gaslin
(Jeremy Irons), has a teenage son
RogerGosselyn(ThomasSturridge),
and has a talent that captivates her
audience. She has a great and popu-
lar career, is in her fifties and can
pass as a twenty-something actress.
So what is going wrong?
Though it looks like she has it
all, she is completely exhausted by
being the only one in the whole play
giving it her all. She just wants a hol-
iday and is also very fearful of her
growing age. She is bored and look-
ing for something to spice up her
life. Her life and acting performanc-
es are inspired and turned around
when she is seduced and starts an
affair with the much younger gold
digging Tom Fennell (Shaun Evans).
Unaware of Tom’s trick, Julia pays
for his bills and gives him expensive
presents. I was all perked up when
I heard Tom’s birthday was on 20
November, which was the same day
I saw the movie and also my birth-
day! How coincidental can one get?
Throughout the whole film, Julia’s
dead mentor Jimmy Langton
(Michael Gambon) is very much
alive (more like a ghost) to her,
reminding her of how everything
outside the theatre is just a fantasy
and isn’t real. It doesn’t help either
when her son Roger tells her that
“you have a performance for every-
one. I don’t think you exist. Even the
things you say are second hand”.
It is a very touching moment and
you can almost see Julia’s façade
clear away for a moment to reveal
the person within, but only for a
microsecond.
Julia’s husband, who believes in
being a “modern couple”, is aware of
her unfaithfulness but is completely
OK with it as long as it doesn’t affect
her stage performance. He is too
busy counting the cash. Anyhow,
Julia sees the light when Tom turns
his attention to a girl of his age, the
beautiful-perfect-figured air-head-
ed actress Avice Crichton (Lucy
Punch). Avice tries to be a genius,
acting as Julia. She goes on to take a
role in Julia’s next play and also has
an affair with Tom. This is exactly
where the whole movie takes a twist
and a new side of Julia comes into
play.
The personal and tactful revenge,
comedy and excitement of how Julia
uses her gift to basically stand up
and manipulate everyone who had
screwed her keeps you interested
for the remaining part of the movie.
She might be glamorous, stunning
and ladylike, but no one can fool
her! She won’t just take it when
an upcoming younger actress takes
her part without putting up a fight.
She does this in a very intricately
planned act consisting of making
everyone else soar and then pull-
ing the rug from right underneath
them, just as they are touching the
stars. You almost empathise with
the other characters and yet you are
rooting for Julia all the way. After all,
this is what acting is all about. All is
fair in war and the theatre.
The wonderful knockout acting of
Bening is even considered by some
to be worthy of an Oscar nomina-
tion. The movie basically shows how
an actress copes with her theatre
role and her normal daily life, which
is kind of hard to distinguish. You
really can’t tell the difference when
she is Being Julia or whether she
is just using her acting skills. Her
character really gets through to the
viewer from her elegant and polite
personality to a totally inhuman
quality.
The director, István Szabó, visu-
alises the 1930s well. He develops
each role in the movie. The only role
that didn’t shine as much would be
the young lover Tom. His character
is badly cast and there is the whole
danger of his presence threatening
the scenes with Julia. There just
wasn’t any spark between Tom and
Julia, possibly because most of the
time you are thinking, “yuck”.
However, the director brings a
warm and welcome palette of col-
ourful cinematography and style. It
is beautifully set and it is believable
that it did in fact happen. There are
no special effects that jump out at
you and the whole scene of the movie
is made to look very much inkeeping
with the time. The cars, costumes
design, restaurants scenes, dance
sequences and the whole production
of the movie are very realistic. Even
the way Julia’s best friend tells her
that “he plays for the other side” is
so quaint. As for the script, it was
perfect for Julia’s mentor. The script
has richness, smart writing and a
density of the language. There are
a lot of dialogue and a whole range
of emotions.
Though the movie has a slow pace,
it is a masterpiece. One to go and
watch if you want to fancy yourself
a literary!

“With minute-by-
