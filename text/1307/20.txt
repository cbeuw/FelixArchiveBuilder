Less is Moore?
You’ve all seen the film: now you can read the book. Marc Warner and Damien
Stephenson did just that, but perhaps wish they hadn’t bothered

The Official Fahrenheit 9-11 Reader
declares itself to be “the must-read
book of the must-see movie box office
smash”. It’s really not. If you’ve seen
the movie you’ve already covered
the two fifths of the book, dedicated
simply to the transcript of F9-11 the
movie in a far more digestible form.
Given that the book costs £8.99 and
Michael Moore has said on occasion
that he has no objection to anyone
downloading F9-11 the movie for
free, I suggest that at the very least
you skip this section.
It bothers me, though, that we’re
being charged at all for the book
when Mikey ‘man of the people’
Moore is so desperate to get his mes-
sage across. Surely the internet is
the perfect medium to publish such
a work? But I guess when you’ve
got repayments to make on a $1.2
million apartment in Manhattan’s
plush East Side you can’t afford to
be too generous.
The second part of the book sees
Moore “fire back at the critics with
his own ‘Fact Bible’ to prove that
it’s all true”. Sadly it’s beyond the
scope of this article to meticulously
comb through this part of the book.
I will, however, recommend the
website www.davekopel.com/Terror/
Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.
htm for an in depth analysis of the
‘fact bible’.
I will try to summarise it in more
general terms. To start with, the
‘fact-checker’ comprises 56 pages
out of the 342 in the book, which is
disappointing given that it’s the only
new content written by Moore. Even
the handful of responses that are
included carefully dodge the issues
in typical Moore style. He meticu-
lously addresses non-points, issues
which never even called his integrity
into question in the first place, whist
ignoring the parts of a particular
issue where he has chosen to totally
subvert the truth.
A typical example of this is the seg-
ment detailing the apparent vested
interest that George W Bush had in
the construction of an oil pipeline in
Afghanistan. Moore’s original asser-
tion in F9-11 is that the visit of the
Taliban to Texas while Bush was
governor was to strike a deal to
construct an oil pipeline in
Afghanistan, and furthermore, that
the war in Afghanistan was fought
simply to secure that pipeline. As
the company that originally pro-
posed the pipeline, Unocal, has links
with Vice President Dick Cheney,
in Moore’s eyes the conspiracy is
complete.
However, many critics point out
that the Taliban’s visit to Texas
had absolutely nothing to do with
Bush and that documents show that
Unocal had completely abandoned
the idea of building the pipeline in
1998, long before the introduction of
US troops into Afghanistan.
In response Moore’s ‘fact-bible’
asserts that Unocal issued a press
release, saying that “Halliburton
Energy Services had been pro-
viding a variety of services in
Turkmenistan for the last five years
[1992-97]”. Brilliant Mikey! The
word ‘Afghanistan’ isn’t even men-
tioned, nor is any activity after 1997,
some four years before Bush alleg-
edly invaded Afghanistan in order
to secure the development of this
pipeline. This is supposed to con-
vince us?
Michael then wants us to know
how he’s changed people’s lives.
This involves 37 pages of emails
to Moore that really can’t be of
interest to anyone outside the pro-
duction crew of F9-11 and Moore’s
immediate family. I could forgive
one or two but I am genuinely at
a loss to explain what anyone is
going to get out of 31 almost identi-
cal emails about how the sender’s
dad, who was previously chairman
of the Republican party, signed
up to buff John Kerry’s numerous
and undoubtedly well-deserved
medals after he’d seen the film
or some similar inconsequential
rubbish.
Of course the best thing about
this book is how laughable Michael
Moore’s vision of his own self-impor-
tance is, now that the elections of
Tuesday 2 November have come and
gone. This is particularly illustrated
in the essays and cartoons at the
end of the book. All portray Moore’s
notion that he was somehow going
to change the world with his film,
an idea that seems especially quaint
now.
The American people that Moore
so loves to insult and ridicule evi-
dently aren’t as stupid as he thinks,
and cannot have their minds
changed on crucial issues just by
watching (or indeed reading) 122
minutes of rantings by a tubby mid-
westerner.
Sorry Mike, but the game’s up, you
didn’t change the world. But hey,
maybe none of this would have hap-
pened if you and thousands of your
followers hadn’t voted for Nader
instead of Gore in 2000... or was that
really all just a dream?

To promote the release of his new
book Big Bang, Imperial gradu-
ate and author of Fermat’s Last
Theorem Simon Singh stopped by to
talk to Felix Books.
Your latest book, Big Bang, is
quite a wide-ranging look at cos-
mology and physics in general. Do
you have a favourite area of this
subject?
To be honest, it was just a relief to
get back to some physics! Fermat’s
Last Theorem was great fun to do,
but I appreciated the opportunity
to write about something different
in this book. I think it’s important
to write about some of the history
behind the pioneers of cosmology,
and I like to talk about the people
involved in such important ideas.
You studied physics at Imperial
back in the mid-1980s. Do you
have any fond memories of your
time here?
IparticularlyrememberBobJoseph,
who I believe is now the head of
admissions here. Whilst there isn’t
one particular famous physicist or
lecture here that inspired my inter-
est in the subject, I’m pleased to say
that I’ve been encouraged by a suc-
cession of fantastic teachers. I’ve
always thought that the teaching at
Imperial is excellent. The country
needs more good teachers though!
Do you remember reading or writ-
ing for Felix?
I remember Felix very well. It was
edited by Pallab Ghosh when I was
here. I also used to edit the physics
newspaper, which was known as
Schrödinger’s Cat back then.
What advice do you have for a
budding popular science writer?
Writing is a lot easier to get into
than television. It’s great that you
don’t need any special equipment
to start: just a pen and paper or a
computer at home. I’ve tried to build
a little humour into my lectures
recently, especially as not everyone
is as willing to give science a chance
as Imperial students are! I’ve learnt
a lot about my style by giving lec-
tures across the country and to a
variety of different audiences, each
with a different attitude to science.
Finally, having written about cos-
mology, do you think your career
is going to continue expanding
indefinitely or might it collapse
back in on itself?
Well, I’m hoping for infinite expan-
sion! However, I’m enjoying rein-
venting myself every few years, a
bit like Madonna I guess. Each time
I move on to a different area, it’s like
researching another mini-degree,
which is a great way to work if
you’re interested in lots of differ-
ent things like me. This way I can
expand for a while and then move
on to another ‘universe’ and then
expand again.
Multiple Madonna realities…
what an interesting image.
