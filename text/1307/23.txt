A tale of two Seans
You might need an epidural for this difficult delivery
23
A rip roaring action adventure with
extravagant special effects and a
killer soundtrack is certainly not
what you will get if you go to see
Birth. Nor will you find a warm fuzzy
love story promising that, in the end,
all you need is love. Instead, you will
find a dark brooding human drama
that shows how people are never
quite what they seem.
An ordinary man dies and just
afterwards, somewhere in the same
city, a baby is born. Ten years later,
a little boy goes to the still-grieving
widow, Anna (Nicole Kidman), and
tells her that he is her dead hus-
band. Anna was about to remarry
though, until young Sean showed up
purporting to be her dead Sean and
telling her that he wants her back.
Should she believe him, because he
seems to know so much about her,
or is he just a weird little kid with too
much time on his hands?
Set in New York, the director,
Jonathan Glazer, uses winter to
symbolise Anna’s still lingering
mourning as well as contrasting it
well with the warmth and comfort
that her family and new fiancé want
to provide her. Glazer also captures
New York high society and deft-
ly uses a grand dame of cinema,
Lauren Bacall, to portray Anna’s
wise, if distant, mother. Bacall defi-
nitely makes her presence felt in
every scene she appears in.
Kidman, playing Anna, is almost
brilliant. She gives the character the
emotional fragility that she needs as
well as the obvious beauty required.
But watching her, I almost always
felt that I was watching Kidman play
another role rather than observing a
completely new character.
The director effectively uses many
close-up shots of Kidman’s face
to display her reactions to highly
charged situations. Whist this works
for Anna because we know her gen-
eral mindset, Glazer tends to over-
use this technique to show the emo-
tions of other characters who we
know nothing about.
This includes Cameron Bright who
plays young Sean convincingly and
eerily well. You may remember him
as the psychotic boy in Godsend.
Here he doesn’t have homicidal ten-
dencies, but there is undoubtedly an
undercurrent of instability with this
kid. He interacts well with Anna,
being open with her but at the same
time hiding from her his true pur-
pose.
A lot goes unsaid in this film and
there is a deep feeling of repressed
emotion throughout, making it feel
heavy and laborious. That said, I
think it would have benefited from
moredialogue,astherewaspotential
for some great emotional exchanges
between Kidman and Bacall when
they came to odds.
So with its stellar cast and a cre-
ative if slightly unusual premise,
what does this film really deliver?
Unfortunately, not that much. It
starts off telling one story, changes
its mind halfway through and takes
on another. Its slightly supernatural
tact eventually takes the easy option
and gives us a simple and slightly
disappointing explanation.
This doesn’t make the most of the
story’s most interesting feature: the
enigma of the boy Sean. The mys-
tery of the story is also underplayed
because Glazer decides instead to
focus on the emotional reactions of
the character. He also falls short in
concentrating on creating depth for
the central characters whilst leav-
ing the supporting cast rather two-
dimensional.
Anna and her husband’s relation-
ship is never fully explored. This is a
shame, since the film is based on the
fact that Anna loved her husband so
much that she suspends all rational
thought and is prepared to begin a
relationship with a ten-year-old boy.
This led to great controversy sur-
rounding the film. A bath scene
involving Kidman and Bright was
booed at the Cannes Film Festival,
and it came across as awkward and
unnecessary. Though this dominat-
ed the media due to its certain unsa-
voury nature, the emerging relation-
ship it is trying to represent never
quite gets off the ground.
Overall Birth is a strange little
creation that boasts a strong cast,
but even they cannot save it from
itself. It had great potential but it
never quite lives up to its promise
and comes across as a slightly tedi-
ous story with no real point.
