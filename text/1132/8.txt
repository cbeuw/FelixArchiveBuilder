8 Fiction 18 January 1999
Stella did n o t w a n t to be here, that
was all that she was thinking about.
She did not w a n t to be here, sitting
on this l u m p y sofa, d r i n k i n g this
tea, trying to make conversation with
these impossible people. She w o u l d
have paid a lot of m o n e y to have
been somewhere else, anywhere else.
She was at her mother-in-law's,
w h o had issued the invitation almost
five m o n t h s previously. Stella had
taken an instant dislike to the flat,
and ten minutes later she was p o s i -
tively repulsed by it. However, w h a t
was worse were the people w h o were
in it. They were a few selected friends
of Henry's m o t h e r : seven a n c i e n t
and shrivelled w o m e n , whose h u s -
bands had without exception expired
many years previously. These w o m e n
(Henry's m o t h e r had to be regret-
tably included) were so grossly c o n -
ceited and c o n t e m p t u o u s that it was
verging o n the comical.
Stella, however, was f i n d i n g it
everything else but comical at this
m o m e n t . She was sitting on the edge
of the sofa a n d was s t r u g g l i n g
through the last ruins of a conver-
sation with the person o n her right.
It was clear that the dialogue had
died some time ago yet she was stub-
bornly trying to carry it o n . Part of
the p r o b l e m was the fact that her
conversational partner looked and
smelt like she had been living in a
bottle of gin for the past ten years.
W i t h a s u d d e n c o m p u l s i o n , Stella
abruptly s t o p p e d the m o n o l o g u e
and turned to her left to find the per-
son sitting there staring at her.
Stella's left n e i g h b o u r h a d a very
interesting m o u t h : it looked like it
had been y a n k e d shut with a length
of string, a n d twitched a n d p r o -
truded f r o m the sunken face as if
someone was still pulling the string.
The old w o m a n ' s eyes were fixed
on Stella's and it actually looked like
she was going to say something. Fire
the cannons, t h o u g h t Stella, one of
these crones is actually going to start
a conversation with m e for once.
"Tell me," the w o m a n wheezed,
"you were married in December, is
that correct?"
Stella n o d d e d hesitantly. "Yes..."
" A n d y o u have a child n a m e d
J o y s
in, t h e
A t t i c
James?"
"That's right."
" M r s . M a y told me that he was
b o r n in M a r c h . " Stella was not so
f o r t h c o m i n g with a response. She
was slightly uneasy as to where this
was leading.
"Yes..." she said again. The old
w o m a n paused, as if she was trying
to achieve some effect.
" D o n ' t y o u think June or there-
after w o u l d have been m o r e a p p r o -
priate?"
Stella had to think for a m o m e n t
and then realised that the w o m a n
was referring to the fact that James
had been born less than nine months
after her w e d d i n g . For a m o m e n t
anger threatened to crush her c o m -
posure a n d she struggled to remain
civilised.
" W e are all entitled to our o p i n -
ions," she said curtly.
" W h e r e is the child n o w ? " the
w o m a n croaked.
"He's asleep next d o o r . "
" A l o n e ? "
"Yes, alone." There was an uneasy
silence between them, which the old
w o m a n seemed to regard as a kind
of victory. Stella decided to continue.
"But I can hear if he so m u c h as
squeaks, look." She briefly s q u i r m e d
on the sofa and extracted a radio-like
object f r o m her jeans pocket. There
was a soft but clearly audible rasp-
ing emanating from it, "We call it the
baby phone. There's another like it by
James's bed. It transmits even the
slightest s o u n d to this one. Listen,
y o u can hear h i m snoring..." Stella
held it o u t for the w o m a n to e x a m -
ine. For o n e m o m e n t , it s e e m e d
there was a gleam of curiosity in the
old lady's eyes and her w i t h e r e d
hand was already hovering to reach
for it. Then she started and her hand
d r o p p e d back into her lap like a
dead fish. She gave a kind of snort-
ing s o u n d .
" H o w can y o u entrust the safety
of y o u r child to an electric box like
that?" She grated.
Stella regarded her adversary
w i t h a m i x t u r e of disbelief a n d
almost pity. Then the sight of her
husband rising from his chair across
the r o o m caught her eye. Henry m e t
her gaze, winked, and slunk though
the door. "Excuse me," Stella snapped
and followed h i m with great relief.
She f o u n d h i m sprawled o n the
double bed in the adjacent r o o m ,
beside the cot where James was still
s n o r i n g away through his tiny pink
nose. W i t h a resigned sigh she lay
beside h i m and rested her head on
his chest, which tremored with silent
chuckles.
" D o n ' t say w h a t y o u ' r e about to
say," he whispered. "You were about
to say that y o u w o u l d rather have
washed a h u n d r e d dead camels than
c o m i n g here today, a m I right?"
" N e a r e n o u g h , "
" O K , b u t w o u l d y o u have also
given t h e m m o u t h - t o - m o u t h ? "
"Look, I'm sorry Henry, but I'm
not in the m o o d for this."
"Alright, Alright," and they lay for
a while in silence.
After a while Henry spoke again,
"I think it's time I let y o u into some
secrets," Stella stirred on his chest.
" A r e y o u in the m o o d for some really
juicy secrets?"
" G o on then."
" M a y b e 1 s h o u l d have told y o u
before we came, it w o u l d have cer-
tainly cheered y o u up. W h e r e shall
we start?...urn...OK, you r e m e m b e r
that w o m a n w h o y o u were sitting
beside last time, the one with the
really curly died hair, yes? Her name
is M r s . C r o w and she has a rather
unfortunate health problem. A prob-
lem w h i c h n o n e of the others know
about, bar m y m o t h e r that is. You
see, she has a quite large and very
painful cyst on her...urn...well, to put
it crudely, o n her arse. A n d , er... to
be accurate, it's in her arse."
"Henry, w h y o n earth w o u l d I
w a n t to k n o w that?"
"Listen, it gets a lot worse.
Because o f this,..this...THING she
can't wipe herself like n o r m a l people
after having a...well, y o u k n o w what.
Anyway, so instead of w i p i n g she
washes herself a n d at h o m e she has
a bidet installed for this purpose.
However, w h e n she's at other places
there s o m e t i m e s aren't bidets
a r o u n d , so...."
"I really d o n ' t like the s o u n d of
this."
"...So she has to use the sink."
H e n r y p a u s e d a n d savoured the
m o m e n t .
He knew very well that the flat in
w h i c h they were in - his mother's
flat - d i d not contain a bidet. He
waited for a c o m m e n t from Stella
but as there was n o n e he continued.
" O n e day M r s . C r o w w e n t to the loo
here and forgot to lock the bath-
r o o m door. M y m o t h e r entered the
b a t h r o o m unawares and caught her
in flagrante delicto, contorted over
the sink - you can imagine the scene.
