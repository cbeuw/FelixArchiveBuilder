FEAR OF POP
BLACK STAR LINER *

earching t h e w o n d e r f u l e x p a n s e
k n o w n as the w o r l d w i d e w e b I
was struggling to find a picture
for the a b o v e space w h i c h I obviously
never f o u n d a n d h a d t o settle for t h e
a l b u m cover instead. During m y w a n -
d e r i n g t h r o u g h c y b e r s p a c e I c a m e
across m a n y Black Star Liners, but not
the band. Apparently it w a s t h e n a m e
of Marcus Garvey's d r e a m o f a pan-
African s h i p p i n g line. Perhaps not very
interesting, but is this h o w Black Star
Liner t h e band e n d e d n a m i n g t h e m -
selves? S o m e t h i n g for y o u to think
about don't s p e n d t o o l o n g o n it, it
could be a health risk.
Anyway, o n to the a l b u m proper. As
y o u c a n easily suss out f r o m the album's
title. Black Star Liner are o n e o f t h e m u l -
titude o f bands in t h e s c e n e labelled by
s o m e as "The Asian U n d e r g r o u n d " . I'm
not sure if this term is used by music
industry b o d s to g r o u p together bands
with a n Asian s o u n d to their style or if it
m e a n s that a m e m b e r is a person of
Asian origin?
Well, BSf fit into both categories
with an array of sitars, tablas a n d m o r e
conventional samplers providing a more
Western d a n c e beat. BSL are not n e w to
the so called "Asian U n d e r g r o u n d " a n d
have built up a d e v o t e d fan base. The
use o f synth violins is abundant a n d very
effective, a l t h o u g h it c a n get a little
repetitive at times. The a l b u m ' s o p e n e r
Slta D sets t h e m o o d , dark a n d oppres-
sive but always provides y o u with a hint
of lightness to relieve the claustrophobia.
Superfly and Blndl has leanings towards
the majority o f Massive Attack's Karma-
coma. W h a t I w o u l d like to k n o w is
whether BSL listeners actually k n o w what
a bindi is?! Chilled out is blatantly the
approach here, so if you like your sounds
m e l l o w give this a try. H

Volume 1
N
ormally, s p o k e n - w o r d ' c o n -
cept' a l b u m s invoke images o f
crusty Beat p o e t s s m o k i n g
Gauloises in dingy f u l h a m cafes - t h e
preserve o f musical psuedo-intellectu-
als like Neil H a m m o n . So a s p o k e n
w o r d a l b u m f r o m the lead singer of
chirpy, Prozac-fuelled Ben folds Live
s o u n d s a b o u t as likely as M a r i l y n
M a n s o n covering B'witched.
However, a s p o k e n w o r d a l b u m is
precisely what M r Fold has p r o d u c e d
a n d it is n o w h e r e near as honey-fied as
you might think. Lor starters, the back-
g r o u n d music displays instrumentation
far m o r e varied a n d interesting than t h e
p o p p y but ultimately bland B e n folds
five's efforts.
M r Fold takes us back to Starsky a n d
Hutch with his ' w a k a w a k a ' s o n g Kops,
and over to Japan for t h e most bizarre
s o n g . In Love - William Shatner talks
about his love for a girl, his acting capa-
bilities used to t h e fullest. It's almost as
m o v i n g as w h e n he says 'Fire!' in a Star
Trek film. Ben folds five eventually s h o w
their face in Avery M. Powers Memorial
Bcltaway. There's n o keyboard but t h e
barbershop quartet are certainly there.
It's a cliche to cite Beck, but the
e x p e r i m e n t a t i o n a n d diversity o f t h e
music, w h i c h in truth dominates the spo-
ken w o r d aspects, are at Beck-like stan-
dards. Should y o u b u y it? I'm not sure.
It's hard to say w h e t h e r I like this a l b u m
b e c a u s e it's g o o d or because it's not as
bad as it could have been. Try before y o u
buy, I think. CI

singles
Llama Farmers - Big Wheels
Craving controversy by putting a p h o t o g r a p h of a n
eight-year-old girl s m o k i n g o n their record sleeve, Llama
Farmers w o u l d d o better to let their music take the front
seat. A constant fight b e t w e e n R.L.M. style semi-
acoustics and the powerful clatter of drums a n d guitars,
Big Wheels is a more than satisfying s o n g to take us into
the n e w year. It is well deserving o f its m o r e than g e n -
erous airplay.
Eve6 - Leech
Just as w e can not have the h e d o n i s m o f N e w Year's
Lve without the a n n o y a n c e o f A n g u s Deayton o n our
TV screens, so w e c a n not have a thriving British indie
scene without the occasional disturbance of a band that
uses v o l u m e as a substitute for talent. Eve6 are such a
band.
Umajets - When I Wake Up
In o n e respect, Umajets are a lot like t h e Lighthouse
Family in that they both s e e m to release a lot o f singles
that s o u n d the same. However, Umajets provide us not
with cheesy M O R pop-soul, but a relaxed c o n c o c t i o n
of Beatlesy m e l o d i e s a n d West Coast harmonies. Not
that bad, actually.
Monster Magnet - Powertrlp
The title track from both Kerrang's a n d Metal H a m m e r ' s
album of the year, Powertrip is also featured in Kurt Rus-
sell's n e w film, Soldiers. So, w e kind o f expect it to be
quite g o o d . Actually it's pants, a hilarious c o m b i n a t i o n
of h e a w metal a n d lets-do-the-hand-Jive.
Loop Da Loop - Hazel
The remix master Loop D a L o o p (a.k.a. Nick Dresti) pro-
vides us here with the first of his o w n material. Released
next m o n t h . Hazel is a c o m i c mixture o f the Freestylers'
style a n d Big Beat's, erm, big beats. LdJ
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Grand Drive - Wrong Notes
This o n e ' s definitely a bit o f a grower. The vocals arc
almost identical to those o f the dread-locked lead
singer of the long absent, grungey and at the same time
mellow, Soul Asylum. The s o n g uses a h a m m o n d a n d
pleasant acoustic guitars that lean towards Spanish
s t r u m m i n g to create a dreamy n u m b e r .
3 Colours Red - Beautiful Day
This is a far cry f r o m the punky freshness o f previous
singles like Nuclear Holiday. Instead 3 Colours Red
have c h o s e n a melancholic a n t h e m i c string laden ditty
to possibly break into the mainstream? I'm afraid it's not
g o i n g to h a p p e n this time lads.
NT - Responsibilities
A gravelly textured voice crying out soulfulness, a c c o m -
p a n i e d by a l o o p i n g bass riff is what y o u get f r o m NT.
The voice is a little t o o similar to o n e o f G o m e z ' s t w o
singers, a n d the cynics a m o n g s t y o u may say that this
is only getting released d u e to t h e inexplicable success
o f t h e G o m e z boys.
Naem - Parrot Fever
I'm sorry, but this is just plain a n d simply boring. It is
repetitive a n d probably c o u l d have b e e n m a d e by any
amateur w o r k i n g away at h o m e with their o w n eight
track r e c o r d i n g g i z m o . A l l e g e d l y Skint records a r c
m e a n t to be t h e c r e a m o f t h e crop w h e n it c o m e s to
'Big Beat' releases. They'd better think again if they want
to maintain this exalted position.
The Yo-yos - You Cot Me Out of My Mind
Visions o f Status Q u o leap out o f the recesses o f m y
m i n d w h e r e they h a d b e e n l o n g buried since t h e vio-
lent torture e n d u r e d at the time of Rocking All Over The
World. This s o n g scared t h e pants off m e w e don't
want a Status Q u o clone, please please please!
Audioweb - Test The Theory
I his is yet another single to get lifted from Fireworks City,
a n d A u d i o w e b c o m e at y o u h e a d o n with a n energy
fuelled track. It's not as stylish as Policeman Skank so I
w o u l d n ' t r e c o m m e n d g o i n g out to b u y this unless y o u
w a n t the t w o extra remixes, with o n e f r o m the excel-
lent I reestylers. Get t h e a l b u m instead if y o u like this
and the other previous singles. EJ
