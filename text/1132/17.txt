Psycho * *
Starring : Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, William H Macy
Director: Gus Van Sant
Psycho 1999 vs Psycho 1960. Same shower. Same knife. New blood.
T
here's s o m e t h i n g very strange
about G u s V a n Sant's r e m a k e o f
Psycho. It's not t h e fact that it's
very, very, very similar t o Hitchcock's
original - I w a s expecting that w h e n I
walked into t h e c i n e m a . T h e p r o b l e m is
that, despite t h e fact that it's almost t h e
same film, it's far, far worse. A n d I don't
k n o w w h y .
It's not t h e cast - admittedly, A n n e
H e c h e (Six Days Seven Nights, Volcano)
is hardly in t h e s a m e league as middle-
class fantasy girl Janet Leigh, but it's cer-
tainly n o t a b a d r e n d i t i o n o f M a r i o n
Crane. M o r e o v e r , whilst Vince V a u g h n
(Swingers, The Lost World) is t h e antithe-
sis of A n t h o n y Perkins in t h e crucial Nor-
man Bates role, h e c o m e s away from the
movie with credit in tact thanks to a nice
line in disconcerting laughter a n d ner-
vous twitching.
It's definitely not t h e direction - V a n
Sant goes to great pains to re-create 9 9 %
of the original (only a d d i n g in a c o u p l e
of additional details which help to explain
V a u g h n ' s c o m p l e x mentality). Every
scene, every c a m e r a angle a n d every
edit is the s a m e - e v e n the o p e n i n g titles
are copied from Hitchcock. Besides, with
the likes o f My Own Private Idaho, Drug-
store Cowboy a n d last year's brilliant
Good Will Hunting o n his CV, Van Sant is
a m o n g s t H o l l y w o o d ' s foremost direc-
tors.
A b o v e all, it certainly isn't t h e plot,
w h i c h is 1 0 0 % t h e s a m e as it w a s in
1960. H e c h e steals $400 000 from her
boss, flees town, hiding out in the lonely
Bates motel, run by V a u g h n a n d his mys-
terious mother. The classic shower scene
e n s u e s a n d h e r sister ( M o o r e ) a n d
boyfriend (Mortensen) set o f f o n h e r
trail, call in a Private Lye (the ever-reliable
Macy) a n d try to find out what links her
disappearance a n d t h e motel.
Perhaps it's simply the passage o f
time. The elements that p r o d u c e d a clas-
sic in the sixties simply don't stand u p to
nineties m o v i e m a k i n g . This Psycho is
(dare I say it) boring. It treads water for
an hour, only hotting u p w h e n M o o r e
finally enters t h e Bates' gothic h o m e to
discover t h e truth. That's not to say that
the original I'sycho isn't still a great
movie, it's just that a n y piece o f art has
to b e j u d g e d - at least in part - by the stan-
dards o f t h e day. For e x a m p l e , if t h e
f o r t h c o m i n g Star Wars Episode One
retains exactly the s a m e look a n d effects
as A New Hope d i d in 1977, it won't
deserve the s a m e recognition because it
w o n ' t have t h e s a m e ground-breaking
originality. Similarly, this doesn't m e a n
that there's anything w r o n g with remak-
ing old m o v i e s - s e e Scarface, The Mag-
nificent Seven, High Society, a n d t h e
u p c o m i n g You've Got Mail for p r i m e
e x a m p l e s o f g o o d remakes - it simply
m e a n s that there's n o point in remaking
s o m e t h i n g if y o u don't a d d s o m e t h i n g
new. V a n Sant h a s claimed that all h e
w a n t e d to d o w a s raise the profile o f the
original, a n d to those o f you w h o haven't
s e e n it, I suggest y o u take his advice -

The Opposite of Sex * *
Starring : Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow, Ivan Sergei
Director: Don Roos
H
ave y o u ever m i s s e d a fort-
night's e p i s o d e s o f y o u r
favourite soap o p e r a a n d c o m -
pletely lost track o f what's g o i n g o n ?
Whatever t h e reason for t h e lapse in
your devotion, there's usually s o m e o n e
on hand to bring y o u u p to date with a
swift s u m m a r y o f t h e recent d e v e l o p -
ments in a n o d d l y eventful Square,
Close or Street in t h e land o f TV. T h e
o p e n i n g 5 minutes o f Ihe Opposite of
Sex ate liable t o r e m i n d y o u o f such a
briefing - t h o u g h with a n o w obligatory
post-modern slant it's t h e film's central
character, 16 year D e e d e e - played by
The Adams Family's C h r i s t i n a Ricci
(more recently star of indie-hits The Ice
Storm a n d The Last of the High Kings) -
w h o s e voice-over provides t h e explana-
tion of her o w n troubled circumstances.
Ricci's unenthusiastic m o u r n i n g at
her step-father's funeral suggests that
she's not so upset to see the back o f him,
but bereavement has driven her m o t h e r
to unbearably neurotic depths. Desper-
ate to escape her Louisiana h o m e , Ricci
heads for Indiana a n d her long lost half-
brother (Donovan), t h o u g h her reasons
for d o i n g s o probably extend b e y o n d
the h o p e o f r e n e w i n g acquaintances.
Thanks to the legacy o f his gay lover,
D o n o v a n is a wealthy m a n , a n d his easy
Eighteen certificate here we come.
g o i n g nature provides a standing invita-
tion for Ricci's p r e c o c i o u s m e r c e n a r y
wiles. D o n o v a n ' s friend (and his d e a d
lover's sister - keep up) K u d r o w is c o n -
vinced that Ricci is n o g o o d , a n d sure
e n o u g h , s h e sets a b o u t t h e rather
unlikely seduction o f his n e w nice but
d i m boyfriend, Ivan Sergei. Very s o o n
the resulting love triangle is further c o m -
plicated b y a n n o u n c e m e n t s o f preg-
nancy, charges o f sexual harassment,
a n d o t h e r storylines culled f r o m t h e
scripts o f third rate Dallas spin offs.
There are o n e or t w o funny lines,
a n d K u d r o w has her fair share as t h e
repressed Lucia. However, s h e s e e m s
unable to a b a n d o n t h e trademark kook-
iness o f her role as Pheobe from Friends,
a n d c o m e s across as half scatty, half
uptight. Even t h o u g h she shares screen
time evenly with her co-stars, it's Ricci
w h o d o m i n a t e s t h e film. Unfortunately,
her non-politically correct k n o w i n g c o m -
mentary fails to illicit t h e belly laughs it
aims for, a n d s u c c e e d s in lending t h e
p r o c e e d i n g s a n irritatingly self-satisfied
tone.
W h e n a soap like Channel 5's plainly
ridiculous Sunset Beach does a better job
of satirising attitudes to sex in t h e 90s, a
film like this s e e m s pretty pointless. Q
