National U25 Tournament
Football
4th XI
IC 5 -1 UCL
A n exceptional p e r f o r m a n c e f r o m the
IC fourth's, fresh f r o m their midsea-
son break (to such delightful places as
Rhyl, Llanboidy a n d A l d e r s h o t ) . W e
c e m e n t e d o u r position at t h e t o p o f
ULU Division 3 a n d are n o w in a great
position to reach t h e u n p a r a l l e l e d
heights o f division 2. O f t h e 8 league
g a m e s remaining, t h e fourth's s h o u l d
be a i m i n g to w i n at least 5 or 6.
This g a m e e x p l o d e d into life in the
first f e w minutes as IC raced into a
two goal lead with goals by A i d e n , fol-
lowing g o o d w o r k by Steve a n d Derek,
and a n e m b a r r a s s e d U C L d e f e n d e r .
From then o n the rest o f the g a m e w a s
really a formality, t h e only q u e s t i o n
being h o w m a n y could IC score. T h e
answer: five, the extra goals c o m i n g
from A d a m , N i m a a n d a penalty f r o m
G u r m (who else could have finished so
clinically f o r m 12 yards?). A m e n t i o n to
Dave Wishart w h o w a s "f**ing a m a z i n g "
(his words) but in m i n e "f**ing shite" as
he gave a w a y a penalty w h i c h w a s
crappily saved by Stu a n d U C scored
with the follow up. Final score 5-1 to IC.
Ladie's Hockey
2nd XI
IC 0 - 8 Royal Free
B o n d a g e Girl drove a full t e a m to the
match in style, only g o i n g onto the pave-
m e n t o n c e . From then o n it w a s all
downhill, mainly because w e ' d turned
up to play hockey and e n d e d up playing
w a t e r p o l o (taking o u r o w n u m p i r e
s h o u l d have h e l p e d , but unfortunately
Saboteur didn't d o anything to jeopar-
dise the oppositions score). Scousc Git,
w h o w a s t o o h u n g o v e r to play, w a s
badly m i s s e d , a l t h o u g h to b e honest
the forwards rarely got the ball. 2 Jags
got in s o m e g o o d e l b o w tackles, while
e v e r y o n e else got their exercise run-
ning around the alcohol section o f Sains-
bury's - its g o o d to s e e the ladies 2 n d
t e a m still has its priorities straight.

Hockey: IC 1 9-2 UCLMS
Refs w e r e rubbish, and the weather w a s
poor. Although not as poor as the o p p o -
sition. Ic s h o u l d have h a d twice as
m a n y goals.
Recently IC Bridge Club entered for t h e
L o n d o n qualification r o u n d o f t h e
National U25 Paris contest. For t h e n e w
recruits in the club this w a s to b e a n
opportunity to play bridge for t h e first
time. I or the m o r e s e a s o n e d players in
the club it w a s to b e a n opportunity to
h o n e their tournament play ready for the
f o r t h c o m i n g Portland B o w l matches. At
least that w a s the theory.
A strong field of players m a d e for dif-
ficult but enjoyable play. Unfortunately,
the strong field a n d complexity o f s o m e
hands proved too m u c h for m a n y o f the
IC pairs, however, x-IC partnership D o m
G o o w i n (Bat) and Jon Todd (Hcff) did w i n
the overall c o m p e t i t i o n , beating 3 Eng-
land pairs, comfortably qualifying for the
national finals.
Especially g o o d p e r f o r m a n c e s by
M i c h a e l Lee Klen V o n g a n d his partner
A n s o n Williams saw t h e m beat everyone
else in t h e club, including both Imperial
A a n d B teams. Another impressive per-
f o r m a n c e w a s that o f A n n a i g Jazque-
m a r d >and Rupert C h a p l i , w h o as a
beginners pair did very well beating most
of the rest o f t h e club!

OK. Even a l l o w i n g for exams, the start
of term a n d e v e n the weather, I'd have
thought y o u lot c o u l d d o a little better
than three brief articles.
Last term saw a g o o d range of arti-
cles f r o m lots o f teams a n d clubs a n d
I h o p e that continues into this term. So
get t h o s e articles in. In t h e m e a n t i m e
enjoy these articles f r o m t h e world o f

We are a confidential listening and practical information
helpline, run by students for students. We are open from
6pm until Sam every night of term. At the moment we
are looking for students who want to train as volunteers.
We don't care what age or sex you are, or what college
you are from, or what course you are studying. If you can
give up three nights a term and think that you would be
able to listen to someone in a friendly, non-judgmental
way you could be ideal for us. You don't need any expe-
rience, we'll give you all the training you need. So if you
want to help other students and join an organisation with
a fun and active social side please get in touch.
Come along to our Introductory Talk
on Tuesday 9th February at 7.00pm
in ULU, room 3C
or ring the helpline (number above).
