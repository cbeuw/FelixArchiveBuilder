retirement leaves chasm
in us's sporting psyche
The retirement last w e e k o f M i c h a e l Jordan, regarded
by many as o n e o f t h e greatest professional athletes
ever, has left t h e A m e r i c a n p e o p l e , a n d m u c h o f t h e
world, in a state o f shock.
The greatest, a n d certainly wealthiest, player t h e
National Basketball Association (NBA) has ever s e e n
a n n o u n c e d his intention t o leave t h e sport saying "I
played it to t h e best I could play it. I tried to be t h e best
basketball player I could be."
Jordan, w h o s e n a m e has b e e n s y n o n y m o u s with
the N B A for over 10 years says h e is " 9 9 . 9 % certain"
about retirement this time, having previously given u p
5 years ago, f o l l o w i n g t h e g u n n i n g d o w n o f his father.
After 6 championship w i n n i n g seasons out o f 8, a n d five
most valuable player awards, Jordan felt it w a s t h e
"right time to leave t h e g a m e . I a m at p e a c e with that.
Physically I a m fine, but I a m mentally e x h a u s t e d . "
Jordan, holder o f several multimillion dollar c o n -
tracts f r o m various s p o n s o r s (including t h e 'Air Jordan'
trainer produced by the sports giant Nike), said he m a d e
his decision s o m e t i m e a g o , but w a n t e d to wait until
the e n d o f t h e lockout b e t w e e n t e a m s a n d players
before a n n o u n c i n g his decision. The lockout, which has
crippled almost t h e entire season this year, w a s recently
solved after players a n d owners finally gave each other
Michael Jordan
s o m e g r o u n d after a bitter player strike that has lasted
over 7 months, a n d threated to wipe out the entire sea-
son. The retirement of the sports greatest player will
have d i s m a y e d N B A officials w h o face an uphill task to
re-engage the attention of a public disenchanted by the
greediness o f owners a n d players. TV ratings a n d sta-
d i u m a t t e n d a n c e s will u n d o u b t a b l y b e significantly
In conference finals
Last w e e k e n d s a w t h e NFL c o n f e r e n c e finals b e t w e e n
teams that a r e hard t o separate in terms o f ability.
R e i g n i n g c h a m p i o n s t h e D e n v e r B r o n c o ' s start as
favourites to recapture their SuperBowl title in t w o
w e e k s time, but Atlanta or M i n n e s o t a will provide
t o u g h c o m p e t i t i o n in t h e SuperBowl. This o f course

If I have space to fill again this term, I intend to pub-
lish a full review of the NFL season and the Super Bowl
shortly after it is played. If anyone out there feels they
know something about American Football and feeling
like writing an article get in contact. I am also willing
to publish articles on the FA Premiership/Rugby Pre-
miership when/if space allows. If you want to write any-
thing drop mc a line at goap98@doc.lc.ac.uk.
