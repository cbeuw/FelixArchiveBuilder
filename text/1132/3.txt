Grandmaster To
Challenge IC Students
It's not every day that y o u get to tackle
a Grandmaster over t h e chessboard...
O n your own? N o way! But with a f e w
friends to keep y o u company? I l m m ,
maybe...
O n M o n d a y 25 January y o u will have
that chance. Dr Jonathan M e s t c l from
the M a t h s Department, o n e o f the top
G r a n d m a s t e r s in t h e country, will b e
challenged by u p to 40 o p p o n e n t s simul-
taneously.
He's good... but he's not invincible.
With 40 g a m e s to concentrate o n at the
s a m e time, he's got a t o u g h j o b o n his
hands. Y o u m a y just get lucky. You
only n e e d to draw a n d you'll be a hero
(or heroine). Even if y o u lose you'll be
in g o o d c o m p a n y , you'll have s o m e fun
a n d find out just h o w g o o d a Grand-
master really is.
A n y o n e at t h e C o l l e g e can take u p
the challenge. Y o u don't have to b e a
Grandmaster yourself, y o u don't have
to be a m e m b e r o f t h e chess club, y o u
only n e e d to k n o w h o w to play.
the event will start at 6.30pm a n d fin-
ish by 1 0 p m . T h e l o c a t i o n will b e
a n n o u n c e d later, there is n o charge for
entering. Latecomers can be a c c o m -
m o d a t e d , a n d spectators arc w e l c o m e .

day 25 January, or to find out more about

The Holland Club, a members only club for IC staff and some postgraduates (e.g.
Felix columnist Simon Baker), Is situated underneath the west end of the Sherfield
Building. The bar received a brief refurbishment over the holidays - but don't worry,
all you finance conscious club treasurers, the work was paid for by profits made in
the Club and not out of college funds. Photo: Jonas
