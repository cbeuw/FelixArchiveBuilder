Blizzard Compilation [Diablo, Starcraft and warcraft II] (PC)
Blizzard
You can always tell w h e n our beloved
Games Editor is short of material - "Here
you go" he said "Blizzard have just released
three games in a special pack. Pop off and
do m e 200 words o n each." A n d h e dis-
appears off to the union bar. Typical.

Ihe original Warcraft w a s released (if
m e m o r y serves m e right) shortly b e f o r e
C o m m a n d & C o n q u e r , a n d s u f f e r e d
(somewhat unfairly) d u e to t h e blitz o f
hype surrounding W e s t w o o d ' s u n d o u b t -
edly excellent effort. It also lost out to
C&C in that it didn't have a multiplayer
m o d e - almost a cardinal sin n o w , but not
so u n c o m m o n a f e w years a g o . Rather
than b e i n g set in the near future, War-
craft w a s set in a mythical land
w h e r e tribes o f m e n a n d ores
fought it out, c o m p e t i n g for gold,
lumber a n d land. Warcraft II w a s
released in 1996 a n d , as t h e n a m e
suggests, it is bigger a n d better. It
also i n c l u d e s that crucial multi-
player c o m p o n e n t (up to 8 players
can h o o k u p together at a time).
The graphics are m u c h i m p r o v e d
on both the original a n d C&C, but
nonetheless are starting to s h o w
their age. Still, if y o u like RPGs
a n d C&C, this is w e l l w o r t h t h e
price. This v e r s i o n i n c l u d e s a n
expansion pack ("Beyond t h e Dark
Portal", since y o u asked).
Starcraft h a s b e e n o n e o f my
favourite g a m e s for s o m e time. It is
(again) very similar to C&C, but is set in
the far e n d s of the galaxy (or s o m e -
w h e r e like that). You can control o n e of
three races; h u m a n s (as in "You puny..."),
Zergs (as in t h e noise p e o -
ple make w h e n they've had
their throat torn out by a
sort of alien version of a
d o b e r m a n ) a n d the myste-
rious a n d rather tetchy Pro-
toss. The g a m e p l a y is
s o m e w h a t m o r e varied
than in either Warcraft or
C&C, with missions ranging
f r o m s e c u r i n g l a n d i n g
z o n e s through full-frontal
assaults o n alien bases, through creep-
ing a r o u n d alien-infested ships l o o k i n g
for lost personnel and/or data files, to sit-
ting tight in a beleaguered garrison des-
perately h o p i n g that your evacuation
ships will arrive before your base is wiped
out. Blizzard have m a d e full use o f their

v i d i n g you're prepared
to read b e t w e e n t h e
lines. The w h o l e thing is
very well put together,
a n d there are influences f r o m a vast
range of different semi-classics (more
obvious o n e s b e i n g C&C, Space Hulk,
Civilisation). Unless you're actually aller-
gic to this kind of futuristic stuff, you'll
love it.
Diablo is the third g a m e in t h e pack.
It's a m o r e traditional RPG, with y o u tak-
ing charge of a character from one; o f
three different b a c k g r o u n d s (warrior -
big sword, heavy eyebrows, skin colour
of a tandoori chicken; r o g u e - female,
bow-mistress, clven, funny pointy
ears; sorcerer - l o n g white beard,
smells funny, g o o d with fireworks).
The action takes place b e l o w
g r o u n d , in a vast d u n g e o n with a
variety o f lairs. The level design is
a series o f quests, each of w h i c h
tends to e n d with the destruction
(hopefully) ofasupra-baddie. How-
ever, there's n o n e o f that n o n s e n s e
about completing o n e quest before
y o u start t h e next. If y o u like, y o u
can g o off halfway through o n e , d o
