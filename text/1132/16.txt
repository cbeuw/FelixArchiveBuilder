Ttia Bomb!
T h a t W a s T h e Y e a r T h a t W a s .1998
So, another year has g o n e by. As ever, loads has hap-
p e n e d in the 9-8, p r o b l e m n o w is w h e r e to e v e n
begin
Well, f e w
artists c o u l d
have d r e a m e d
for a better
start to 1998
than have a
N o . 1 hit o n
the T o p 40,
especially a US
R'n'B singer
a n d that is
exactly w h a t
h a p p e n e d to
U s h e r . After
b l o w i n g up on
m p o r t in '97
You Make Me
Wanna got a
British release
a n d e n t e r e d
as a n e w entry
at t h e top of
the charts
back in Janu-
ary. Since then
U s h e r has
released Nice & Slow a n d My Way, both of w h i c h w e r e
relatively l o w key a n d the m a n s e e m e d to disappear.
Have no fear, fans can look forward to a f o r t h c o m i n g
single One Day You'll Be Mine as well as Usher's big
break onscreen in that "extended-Tommy-Hilfiger-com-
mercial" feature The Faculty in 1999.
Sticking with the teens. Brandy & M o n i c a had a sur-
prising crossover hit with The Boy Is Mine. The s o n g
itself not only caught our attention but also provided
various stories about the major rivalry b e t w e e n the t w o
- why did Brandy perform solo o n The Tonight Show and
what about the p u n c h up at the MTV V i d e o Awards?
Brandy's s e c o n d a l b u m Never Say Never hit stores in
June and M o n i c a ' s The Boy Is Mine f o l l o w e d shortly.
Both long players have g o n e o n to achieve platinum
success, but the battle will g o o n a n d o n . M e a n w h i l e
the other t e e n a g e sensation Aaliyah (yeah, she's still a
teenager) p r o v i d e d us w i t h o n e of the s u m m e r ' s
anthems- a clever c o n c o c t i o n of Timbaland beats Arc
You That Somebody
1998 must be r e m e m b e r e d as the year of The Fugees,
all 3 m e m b e r s m a n a g e d to hit the headlines over the
year. Wyclef b e g a n the year In the m i d d l e of the f e u d
b e t w e e n LL a n d Canibus, he w a s dissed as a Bob Mar-
ley impostor by LL a n d as his c o m e b a c k 'Clef recorded
What's 'Clef Got To Do With It. Gone Till November kept
us rockin' all t h r o u g h the early m o n t h s of the year (R
Kelly's vocals m a d e the remix) a n d after a quiet s u m -
mer he returned to e n d the year o n a high note with
a remix of Q u e e n s Another One Bites the Dust. Pras
took the w o r l d by storm with the massive hit Ghetto
Superstar as well as giving the Grease t h e m e tune
s o m e e d g e in the f o r m of the catchy Blue Angels, truly
c e m e n t i n g his place in pop-hop circles. Lauryn p e n n e d
the excellent A Rose Is Still A Rose for diva a n d idol
Aretha Franklin, has a baby son Zion a n d releases what
was truly o n e of the hip-hop a l b u m s of the year The
Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill. N o news of any Fugee pro-
ject in the works but things ain't looking so bad o n the
solo tip, huh?
Girl Power may have suffered a setback this year with
the loss of Ginger Spice (like w e really cared?) but
there was no shortage of female talent in the R&B world.
Destiny's Child w e r e undoubtedly THE girl group of the
year. I knowy'al l w e r e gettin your groove on to No, No,
No a n d With Me. The girls had a little lull but returned
at the e n d of the year with the a m a z i n g Timbaland pro-
d u c e d Get On The Bus, their latest release w h i c h is
taken f r o m the Why Do Fools Fall In Love soundtrack.
W e first heard her quite s t u n n i n g vocals o n Q u i n c y
Jones' a l b u m Q'sJook Joint and this year, l a m i a did not
disappoint with her self-titled debut a l b u m . However,
d u e to the lack of p r o m o t i o n , neither sales nor general
o p i n i o n will reflect the quality of this release w h i c h is
so often the case with R&B. Other notable releases
include that from M y a , Kelly Price's stunning Soul Of A
Woman a n d the w i c k e d but underrated M i s s Jones
album. O n the single tip, w h o could forget Tatyana Ali's
Daydreaming or for the real R'n'B connoisseur, that
b a n g i n ' remix of Taral's How Can I Get Over You, it's
times like this w h e n y o u k n o w LL's still got the skillz.
1 he UK didn't fair badly either on the lady front with Bev-
erly Knight a n d Kele Le Roc breaking t h r o u g h with
their a l b u m s Prodigal Sista a n d Everybody's Somebody
respectively. Beverly hadn't d r o p p e d anything since
Flavour ofFhe Old Skool but she c a m e back with o n e
of the s u m m e r blockbusters Made It Back, R e d m a n
h e l p e d o n rap a n d Beverly y o u definitely back. H i n d a
Hicks c a m e f r o m n o w h e r e at the start of the year and
immediately started hitting us with tune after tune. H o w
can you forget You Fhink You Own Me. With Shola A m a
a n d these three y o u n g ladies as well as The Hon-
eyz? It looks a bit g o o d for the R&B s c e n e
Another Level are on another level,
m u c h props must go to the four
boys, they produce tunes which
really are d o i n g it, their vocals
are as g o o d as a n y b o d y else
out there a n d the production
f r o m Blacksmith is top draw.
Their ability to crossover a n d
bring a street e d g e to the charts
is incredible, record bosses must
be kicking themselves for turning
these boys d o w n , remember they had
to g o to the States to get a deal. Be Alone
No More started it all off, but for m e Freak Me
w a s right o n point a n d these boys just keep c o m i n g !
Will Smith set the scene alight with his o w n brand of
p o p h o p a n d w e thought long and hard about whether
y o u could really call Will Smith an MC? Well not really,
but with infectious hits like Men In Black, Gettin Jiggy
With It, Just Fhc 2 Of Us and Miami, h o w could you hate
this guy? You gotta check out his latest flick "Enemy O f
The State", 1998 was his year, a n d he's storming into
1999 too.
Rap w e n t back to its roots this year. To the g o o d ol' Boo-
gie D o w n (aka. The Bronx) w h e r e it all started. The likes
of Big Pun, Fat Joe, Lord Tariq & Peter G u n z hit us with
floor fillers such as Still Not A Player a n d Deja vu
(Uptown Baby). Elsewhere, C a m ' r o n represented for
110th Street and above (Harlem World, baby! Check out
the excellent remix of Horse & Carriage). 1M.O.R.E. blew
up Ihe clubs with Superthug Q u e e n s stylee and w e
even had upstate representation from DMX, two albums
in a year, s o m e o n e b e e n busy. Brooklyn in tha house,
well sorta, A Tribe Called Q u e s t d e c i d e d to call it a day
with the release of their 5th a n d final a l b u m The Love
Movement. Black Star continued to uphold the "hip-hop-
with-a-brain" tradition with their m u c h anticipated debut
set- No Alizc or Benjamins Here a n d LA based Black
Eyed Peas had us all s h o u t i n g "That's the joint, that's
the jam!!". A m e n t i o n has to g o to Jurassic Five and their
a l b u m J5, these boys c a m e a l o n g a n d have lit up hip-
hop.
M u s i c moguls/producers m a d e releases but n o n e really
lived up to the hype, there was JD's Life in 1472 (hold
up t h o u g h , w e did all d i g Sweetheart, if only for the
video) and Master P's MP Da Last Don. Incidentally, both
producers have d e c i d e d not to release any further solo
material a n d will concentrate solely o n their recording
artists f r o m n o w o n thank G o d for that!! Missy
took us o n e step closer to that filth-pit k n o w n as pop-
h o p with a collaboration with M e l B aka. Scary Spice,
yeah w e all loved that s o n g / Want You Back not! Word
has it that the Spice Girls flew over to the US recently
to talk to l e d d y Riley about plans for their next a l b u m ,
don't say I didn't warn ya!
There was no significant contribution from THAT m a n ; -
Puffy, until the e n d of the year a n d boy, did he hit us
hard - s h o w c a s e at L o n d o n ' s newly o p e n e d S o u n d
Republic (which he sunk some; m o n e y into), perfor-
m a n c e at the M O B O ' s a n d 3 n e w studio a l b u m s from
faith, lotal a n d 112. A l last the w i c k e d Love Like This
was given a release a n d laid d o w n its claim as tune of
the year. Faith's a l b u m Keep The Faith was packed
with tunes and will certainly g o o n to clas-
sic status. Ihe total a l b u m was a seri-
o u s d i s a p p o i n t m e n t , but 112s
Room 112 m a d e up for it and
m a d e m e think twice about
the boys' ability.
S h e e c e e e e s h , s o m e people
take their time, don't they?
It's taken 3 years for R Kelly to
write a n d release his n e w d o u -
ble a l b u m R, but if y o u heard it
y o u k n o w it's worth the wait. That,
t h o u g h , still doesn't top the 8 years
's taken Whitney H o u s t o n to release
only her 4th studio a l b u m , My Love Is Your Love.
Guys, it's real nice to have y o u back a n d all but do you
think y o u could hurry the hell up next time?!
1999! Watch out for n e w a l b u m s from the street soul
masters Blackstreet, the beautiful trio TLC, toxy Brown,
Q u e e n of R&B MaryJ, M e n O f Vision and of course the
m u c h awaited s e c o n d set f r o m D ' A n g c l o . O n a British
tip I'm l o o k i n g forward to hearing s o m e n e w stuff
f r o m Nine Yards, Kleshay, Kele Le Roc a n d even the All
Saints. Bring it o n !
1999 - THA B O M B !
