Bedlam
' D a Force"
(Edel)
A great single w h i c h contains a s a m p l e
from the disco classic "Can y o u feel the
force?". But unlike m a n y recent artists
and producers, h e hasn't s c r e w e d u p
the original - just a d d e d a m o r e funky
beat. Theres's a range o f mixes so this
should keep y o u d a n c i n g for a while.
Released 18/01/99

Bectrotheque ,
"I M r\ones a P i n n e r "
(Fresh) JL.
The title's a giveaway! It's a dance ver-
sion o f H o t Chocolate's "Everyone's a
Winner" a n d what's m o r e they like it.
N o r m a n C o o k a n d Tong and Jules from
Radio 1 love it - so n o doubt everybody
else will. Personally I think that dance
versions o f classics are crap but that's
just me. Will it be big? Course it will, a n d
if y o u want a d a n c e version o f "Every-
one's a Winner" then errr buy this.

Nymph @ Mass
St. Matthew's Church, Brixton, London,
SW2 - currently monthly residency, the
s e c o n d Saturday o f every m o n t h ,
£10/12/14, 1 0 p m - 6 a m , capacity -
1000. Dress c o d e - just make an effort.
What a venue!!! M a s s , as
the name suggests, is an old converted
church. But this isn't the C o f E's typi-
cal old s t o m p i n g g r o u n d . Insti iu ;t»:
building has an II
flanked by h u g e c o j u p h s , m a k i n g %

Parthenon. I loin the outsideThis plai o
looks like it s h o u l d have an fcleasjblv
high ceiling, but to get to the M o b n u
have to g o up an e n d l j | p ! p i r a l stair-

venue opens out into two large io< 'ins
at either e n d o f the church. T h e m a i n
r o o m has d a n c e floors o n t w o levels,
with s o m e o f the crowd dancing above
the s u n k e n m a i n dancefloor. The DJ is
raised above the crowd a n d is silhou-
etted against s o m e stained glass w i n -
d o w s . T h e s e c o n d r o o m is m o r e
conventional, but the stage at the front
gives any posers a m o n g s t your group
the c h a n c e to d o their thing whilst
l o o k i n g d o w n at us n o r m a l p e o p l e
below.
So the v e n u e is o n e o f the
funkiest I've b e e n to in L o n d o n , but
what about the people? They are t h e
o n e s that m a k e nights actually worth
g o i n g to, especially again a n d again.
Well the N y m p h folk, from the DJs right
d o w n to all the dancefloor punters,
are just as stunning as the v e n u e . It's
rare to g o to b i g L o n d o n v e n u e s these
days that are really friendly, but that's
h o w it is at N y m p h . A n d the p e o p l e
here arc really, really, really friendly to
each other. There's probably a lot of
pre a n d post clubbing rooting involved
with an outing to N y m p h , a n d p e o p l e
don't even stop in the club. With a title
like N y m p h y o u ' d expect there to b e a
lot o f beautiful p e o p l e a r o u n d - a n d
they're there by the truck loads.
This is highly s e x e d club-
bing. But don't you g o thinking that this
is a meat market or a pulling joint.
N y m p h is still very m u c h about the
m u s i c a n d the vibe that's in the club -
s o m e o f the c r o w d just take this to its
natural progression before they head
y i f . l i o m e . I h e N y m p h s o u n d leaves
n o t h i n g to be desired a n d tins is whal
gets t h l f n i g h t to its e u p h o r i c levels.
Ihe m a i n l o o m is s m o o t h , lunky,
gioovy, Boogie-nights, disco-house -
the p j f l e t o strut your funky stuff In.
A n d the s e c o n d l o o m gives a nice
c o n t H t . Progressive beats a n d nu-
b r e a k l l r o m (he likes of Cream s Steve
Lawter will have your's a n d everybody
I ' l s f ! I1||ds in the air a n d a big cheesy
o n n slar-Ped across your face. This is
hard a n d happy music. But it never
falls d o w n o n the side o f c h e e s e - it's
always leftfield e n o u g h to retain a
sense of street cred.
So there y o u have N y m p h . A stunner
of a night at o n e o f the most m e m o -
rable v e n u e s in the capital - sounds
g o o d to m e . I'll s e e y o u there next
m o n t h .
Make the pilgrimage
