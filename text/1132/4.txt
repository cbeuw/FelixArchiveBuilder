LT Delays? Surely not...
Dear Felix,
I'm having a lot o f trouble in getting m y
student P h o t o c a r d f r o m t h e L o n d o n
U n d e r g r o u n d . I sent a n application f o r m
o n t h e 6th o f O c t o b e r with t h e £1 coin,
photograph a n d all t h e other stuff they
require. But I didn't receive anything. S o
at the b e g i n n i n g o f D e c e m b e r I p h o n e d
t h e m to ask w h a t w a s h a p p e n i n g with
my application. They told m e they h a d
not received it. That is quite hard t o
believe that this kind o f envelope (I m e a n
big, yellow a n d printed) c a n get lost...
But a n y w a y I sent a s e c o n d applica-
tion f o r m o n the 3 rd o f D e c e m b e r with
the £1 coin a n d all t h e other stuff. Today
(12th of January) I p h o n e d t h e m . I m e a n ,
I'm b e c o m i n g a bit nervous about getting
this student photocard... A n d g u e s s w h a t
they've told m e I This time they received
my application f o r m but they refused it.
As I'm a P h D student, I sent t h e m a p h o -
tocopy o f m y registration f o r m as a n
Internal postgraduate student o f the Uni-
versity o f L o n d o n stating clearly in capi-
tal letters that I'm a full-time student.
This is a very official f o r m o n a n Imper-
ial College letterhead a n d t h e signature
of the Registry. H o w e v e r they told m e
that they accept only t h e registration
cover n o t e ( y o u k n o w , t h e r e d sheet
with the college stamp you get w h e n y o u
register). I think it is really unfair as it is
written in the application f o r m that they
n e e d 'a clear p h o t o c o p y o f a d o c u m e n t
to confirm your full-time status' a n d this
is exactly what I sent t h e m I Furthermore
a friend o f m i n e sent exactly t h e s a m e
registration f o r m a n d g o t h e r student
photocard in t w o w e e k s I
The worst thing in this entire story is
I wasted a lot o f m o n e y b u y i n g a w e e k l y
travelcard every w e e k as I w a s e x p e c t i n g
to receive m y student p h o t o c a r d fairly
quickly. A n d a s y o u k n o w , o r s h o u l d
know, buying weekly travelcard is m o r e
expensive than buying m o n t h l y travel-
card.
I begin t o believe that t h e L o n d o n
U n d e r g r o u n d is d o i n g whatever it c a n t o
delay t h e process to get your student
photocard. I m e a n if they really w a n t e d
to help students, it should be possible to
get your student photocard in t h e s a m e
w a y y o u get a normal photocard: in t w o
minutes at every u n d e r g r o u n d desk I
I w o u l d like to k n o w if I'm t h e only
o n e to have troubles in getting t h e stu-
dent p h o t o c a r d . S O IF YOU'RE HAVING /

Is currently looking Into the matter (see

Optimism for Equal Ops Brightening Prospects?
Dear Sir,
Your editorial o n "Equal O p s - the N e w
Sexism?" uses your belief that w o m e n
"think differently than m e n " as a basis to
question w h e t h e r w o m e n are as equally
suited t o science as m e n . Your state-
m e n t s s e e m w o r d e d to avoid excessive
offence, but nevertheless they are a crass
generalisation. It is a question for the psy-
chologists, a n d frankly rather irrelevant in
this instance. Every individual studying at
IC w a s a c c e p t e d to d o so o n the basis o f
A-Level grades/interviews w h i c h w e r e
s u p p o s e d t o indicate their suitability for
science. At n o point should their gender
have b e e n a n issue.
It is easy to explain away the gender
disparity at IC with such arguments as
yours, but these can often be a veil for
"the o l d sexism", t h e kind w h i c h kept
eminently capable w o m e n out o f m a n y
professions for centuries. Both y o u a n d
S u s a n n a h H u m f r e y (in h e r p i e c e o n
w o m e n in science) are right to blame the

Campaign for Clayponds
Dear M r Sexton,
I a m a pstgraduate student at Imperial,
a n d I a m writing to y o u about the lack of
a c o m m o n r o o m at Clayponds.
I a w a s a little d i s a p p o i n t e d w h e n I
first arrived in L o n d o n at t h e lack of a bar
/ c o m m o n m r o o m at Clayponds, w h e r e
it w o u l d b e possible t o relax a n d meet
o t h e r s t u d e n t s . After m a k i n g a f e w
enquiries, I w a s told by several sources
that p e r m i s s i o n for such facilities had
b e n g r a n t e d b y t h e relevant C o l l e g e
authorities, a n d that t h e m o n e y to build
t h e m h a d also b e e n sanctioned in spirit.
There a r e m a n y students at Clay-
p o n d s w h o arrive k n o w i n g no-one else
in England, let a l o n e L o n d o n , a n d given
the stressful nature o f this city, it w o u l d
be w o r t h t h e £15k or £20k it w o u l d cost
to build such a small facility, bringing
C l a y p o n d s in line with every other Impe-
rial C o l l e g e hall.
I have s p o k e n to m a n y o f m y fellow
residents, a n d they all agree that a c o m -
m o n r o o m w o u l d improve their quality of
life t r e m e n d o u s l y .
Thanks for your time,
S Virmani
I myself have visited Clayponds, and
wholeheartedly agree that It needs a
common room. As far as I can see,
there Is no good reason why It should-
n't be built right now. Can anyone In col-
lege enlighten me? - Ed
