As in t h e real w o r l d t h e idea is not
to dirty your o w n hands but to force oth-
ers to dirty theirs. This y o u d o by organ-
ising your m e n into teams with weapons,
vehicles a n d sufficient manpower. These
t e a m s are then given their orders for
the w e e k with obvious risks for assassi-
nations, b o m b i n g s a n d setting fire to
the businesses w h o fail to b u y into the
'insurance market'? The 'valuable mutual
benefit market' to give it its full n a m e .
There is obviously less risk but also less
profit to be m a d e by o w n i n g a f e w clean
shops, but they c a n be used to mix g o o d
a n d b a d m o n e y a n d provide a local safe
h o u s e for t h e little dears w h o work for
you. The least risk o f course g o e s with
ordering your t e a m to p o p d o w n the
s h o p to b u y a copy of the local paper -
well o k I m a d e t h e last task u p but with
other gangs coveting your little area a n d
willing to put m o r e lead into your diet,
s o m e o n e must p o p d o w n to the s h o p s
for the milk a n d coffee.
A f t e r t h e orders stage it is time to hit
the streets a n d watch all your best laid
plans suffer f r o m t h o s e little irritants
k n o w n as the general public, t h e police
and other gangsters. Luckily there are still
a f e w tricks u p your sleeve, a n d while
your thugs are pretty brainless they can
deviate from the plans with a simple f e w
clicks o f t h e m o u s e . The action scenes
are also t h e place to be to s e c your little
e m p i r e m o v e o n w a r d s a n d u p w a r d s ,
very r e w a r d i n g in a nasty pain
inflicting way.
A l t h o u g h there has not b e e n
a huge improvement in the graph-
ics or the sound since the s u m m e r
both are about average in a g a m e
like this. The t o w n c a n be v i e w e d
either in simple t o p d o w n plan
m o d e - w h i c h is easier to plan
with, or in a 3D m o d e - w h i c h is
used for the action s e q u e n c e s .
The victims, sorry citizens, o f N e w
T e m p e r a n c e can be heard a n d
seen to interact with your employ-
ees. The t o w n d o e s feel a little like a
1930's City. The g a m e actually feels g o o d
to play - despite t h e burning, blowing up
a n d s h o o t i n g that g o e s on, a n d t h e only
small gripette is that it perhaps takes t o o
l o n g t o get a proper e m p i r e f l o w i n g a n d
so for s o m e takes a little t o o l o n g to get
g o i n g . For those w h o love m a n a g e m e n t
g a m e s it is o n e to sit o n the shelf a n d
play into t h e l o n g hours. For those with
only a r c a d e g a m e s a n d fast f l o w i n g
graphics o n their m i n d s it's not g o i n g to
turn your h e a d in the s a m e w a y that
C&C a n d Red Alert could. It's g o o d , Lat
Tony, but not quite g o o d e n o u g h to talk
its w a y out o f t h e concrete overcoat.

D a m n those satellite w e a p o n platforms.
W h e n they're not b e i n g used to shoot at
M u l d e r a n d Scully by
r o g u e A l ' s they g o all
w r o n g and trigger a global
nuclear a r m e g e d d o n . It's
just not fair.
Thus t h e s c e n e is se
for W a r z o n e 2100. As o n e
of the r e m a i n i n g million
people left o n t h e s m o k -
ing ruins y o u have t h e task o f rebuilding
North A m e r i c a and to get s o m e o f those
lost technologies w o r k i n g again (though
if y o u ask m e leaving it
as a s m o k i n g ruin a n d
moving to Europe might
be a m o r e s o u n d idea).
If you think this s o u n d s
rather M a d M a x e s q u e ,
y o u w o u l d not be t o o
far f r o m b e i n g w r o n g .
Against y o u are various
bands of scavengers along with the occa-
sional remnant o f civilizarion. Yep y o u
could well b e thinking M a d M a x .
Despite having a story s o u n d i n g
like M a d M a x it d o e s appear to be half
decent (at this stage of d e v e l o p m e n t
anyway). Placed very near t h e Battle-
z o n e 2000 ideal of realtime playing c o m -
bined with base strategy and d e f e n c e it
could challenge Tiberian Sun, w h e n e v e r
that decides to p o k e its head a b o v e the

Let's h o p e t h e large n u m b e r o f options

Pentium III - Intel goes for speed
In a very l o w key w a y Intel Corp released details o f t h e next generation o f proces-
sors. C h o s i n g t h e highly original n a m e Pentium III, Intel intend to start s h i p p i n g 450
and 500 M H z versions immediately. A l o n g with t h e raw clock s p e e d increase, they
have also included s o m e extra hardware to help s p e e d u p video, a u d i o a n d sp e e ch
recognition tasks.
Intel also intend to m o v e to a n e w processing facility w h i c h s h o u l d allow t h e
s p e e d to increase t o 600 M H z a n d a b o v e . Intel will also release a m o b i l e version o f
the chip (in t h e n e w 600 M H z flavour) for laptops but not until t h e s e c o n d half o f
this year. Just in time for t h e M i l l e n i u m b u g if they're lucky.
Free Lunch pays dough
Freeserve (the Free internet service provider paid for by Dixons - your friendly, neigh-
b o u r h o o d electrical retailer) has m a n a g e d to entice over 900,000 people to use Inter-
net Explorer 4 a n d sign their pledge to their internet c o n n e c t i o n . Officially the fastest
g r o w i n g ISP in the UK (900 000 customers in 5 m o n t h s kicks A O L ' s UK branch into
the dirt.)
M a r k Danby, general m a n a g e r o f Freeserve said: "It s h o w s w e have d e v e l o p e d
the right f o r m u l a for our customers a n d that y o u don't have to pay for a first class
internet service." The big catch is that for those less technically adept users there is
no free advice a n d help line. Best stick to t h e 56k C o l l e g e service t h e n .
