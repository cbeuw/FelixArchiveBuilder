A
s well as g a i n i n g world-wide criti-
cal praise, 7t h a s secured first-
time director Darren Aronofsky
the D i r e c t i n g A w a r d f o r D r a m a t i c
C o m p o s i t i o n at t h e S u n d a n c e Film
Festival. With these accolades in m i n d I
was expecting a visual feast w h e n I
entered t h e c i n e m a . I w a s not disap-
pointed. A r o n o f s k y d e m o n s t r a t e s his
a m a z i n g c o m m a n d o f c i n e m a t o g r a p h y ,
s h o w c a s i n g non-linear e d i t i n g (MTV
style, epilepsy inducing, cutting) a n d
s o m e bizzare c a m e r a set-ups (at times
strapping c a m e r a s t o various actors
bodyparts). But apart f r o m all these
doubtless fascinating a n d innovative
'tricks' is there a film u n d e r n e a t h t h e
audio-visual b o m b a r d m e n t ?
The a n s w e r is a r e s o u n d i n g yes -
with solid p e r f o r m a n c e s f r o m t h e sup-
porting cast ( w h o mainly consist o f t h e
director's friends a n d family), a n d Sean
Gullette's impressive display as a m a n spi-
ralling into paranoia. T h e film d e m a n d s
self-mutilation a n d a series o f painfully
realistic fits f r o m Gullette, w h i c h h e duly
completes with a manic stare reminiscent
of Nicholson's glory days in One Hew
over the Cuckoos Nest..

Introduction to mad scientists. No 1 - the slinky obsession
While t h e plot s o m e t i m e s d o e s get
a little t e n u o u s , (an overly aggressive
Wall Street firm a n d a Kabbalah sect try
to u n l o c k t h e secrets o f their holy texts)
the extreme pace at w h i c h t h e film's
storyline advances forces you to put such
gripes aside a n d concentrate o n what's
g o i n g o n on-screen. C o n s i d e r e d as a
thriller t h e film works well, k e e p i n g the
viewer attempting to s e c o n d guess the
true motives o f t h e p e o p l e s u r r o u n d i n g
Gullette - w h e t h e r they actually care for
him or are only aiding h i m to f e e d their
o w n selfish needs. Whether t h e film is
science fiction is another matter entirely,
so don't expect M u l d e r a n d Scully or any
warp drives to start appearing.
If you're allergic to strobes or value
your ears, don't s e e this film - everyone
else can sit back a n d fry their brains,
happy in the k n o w l e d g e that they are
w a t c h i n g a great film.

Good Will
Hunting
A m o n g s t all t h e H o l l y w o o d success sto-
ries o f last year, Matt D a m o n a n d Ben
Afleck strode t o t h e front o f the pack
with this brilliantly m o v i n g film.
T w o years a g o , s o t h e story goes,
the pair w e r e in their final year at Har-
vard a n d d e c i d e d they w a n t e d to b e
actors. Trouble w a s they didn't think
they w e r e g o o d e n o u g h t o get cast in
a n y o n e else's film, s o they wrote their
o w n . That script turned into Good Will
Hunting, a n d t w o years later they're
O s c a r w i n n i n g millionaires, d a t i n g
Gwyneth Paltrow a n d W i n o n a Ryder and
amongst the biggest stars in Hollywood.
Lucky, lucky bastards.
The ice Storm
Despite a desperately sad ending (make-
sure y o u b u y five b o x e s o f Kleenex
b e f o r e w a t c h i n g t h e m o v i e ) a n d a
deceptively simple premise, A n g Lee's
film has b e e n (justifiably) s h o w e r e d in
critical plaudits.
Whilst a seventies-set d r a m a sur-
r o u n d i n g a crisis-laden suburban family
might not s o u n d like rivetting viewing,
an eclectic array o f Hollywood's finest
(the likes o f Kevin Kline, j o a n Allen, Eli-
jah W o o d a n d Sigourney Weaver) bring
The Ice Storm to life with a near perfect
display o f e n s e m b l e acting. A d d in bril-
liant direction, a soul destroying script
and that e n d i n g , a n d you're left with
what c a n only be described as a classic
piece o f film-making.
Anastasia
Disney m a y have c o m e in for s o m e flak
recently with their n o n e t o o accurate re-
tellings o f Pocohontas a n d Mulan, but
Twentieth Century f o x ' s Anastasia is o n
a completely different level. For starters,
this Anastasia isn't execu te d - instead
she's chased around Paris by the hench-
m e n o f the evil Rasputin. H m m m . O n
the other h a n d , with M e g Ryan, John
Cusack, a n d Kelsey G r a m m e r o n voice-
over duty, there's certainly n o expense
spared, a n d at times t h e e n d product is
beautifully d r a w n . I lowever, it still lacks
the charm a n d sense o f f u n that gives
Disney classics a real crossover into the;
adult market. D
