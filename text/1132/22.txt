C R I C K E T : E n g l a n d 2 n d b e s t - a g a i n
Following a series w i n against S o u t h
Africa last s u m m e r , a n d t h e prospect o f
not h a v i n g to f a c e s p i n k i n g S h a n e
Warne, England supporters w e r e filled
with h o p e a n d expectation that England
w o u l d actually give Australia a run for
their m o n e y for t h e first time in 10 years.
The build u p to t h e first test w a s not
ideal, with several players s h o w i n g a lack
of form in t h e warm-up m a t c h e s a n d a
worrying back p r o b l e m for former cap-
tain M i k e Atherton. The first test w a s
played in Brisbane at t h e e n d o f Nove-
meber, a n d t h e early g o i n g l o o k e d to b e
fairly even, with Australia r e a c h i n g 106-
4. But a n u m b e r o f m i s s e d c h a n c e s fol-
lowed w h i c h a l l o w e d Steve W a u g h a n d
Ian Healey (perennial thorns in England's
side) to put o n 187 runs for t h e 6th
wicket, a n d s o m e extra runs from the tail
took the total to 485. Predictably England
could not m a n a g e t o match this score,
but looked like the might get pretty close
at 360-6 until the tail collapsed to 375 all
out. A rapid-fire century f r o m d a s h i n g
opener M i c h a e l Slater set u p a large tar-
get for England, w h o predictably wilted
to the leg spin o f Stuart McGill, a n d w e r e
saved defeat by a freak t h u n d e r s t o r m .
Definitely a morale if not actual victory for
Hat-trick Victims: Ian Healy, Stuart McGill and Colin Miller fall to successive deliv-
eries from Darren Gough, who became the first English bowler for 100 years to
take an Ashes hat trick against Australia
Australia. O n t o Perth, a n d a m u c h faster
wicket s a w 21-year old Earl's Court native
Alex Tudor m a k e his test match debut.
Unfortunately the England batting (miss-
i n g best b a t s m a n G r a h a m T h o r p e ,
returned h o m e with a serious back prob-
lem) w a s w o e f u l , m a k i n g only 112 &
191. Australia r o m p e d to a 7 wicket vic-
tory inside 3 days, a n d the scries w a s
looking decidedly out of England's reach.
The only positive to c o m e out of the
match w a s the p e r f o r m a n c e of Tudor,
looking decidedly relaxed a n d hostile,
w h i c h m a d e t h e decision to leave h i m
out for the next test in A d e l a i d e ques-
tionable to say the least. This w a s the
g r o u n d E n g l a n d w o n their only test
match o f the last tour, but it w a s not to
be this time. A big h u n d r e d from Justin
Langer a n d a c o m p l e t e lack of applica-
tion by Lngland's tail in cither innings led
to a 205 run loss. England w e r e d o w n
a n d l o o k e d o n course for a 4-0 defeat in
the five match scries, s o c u e the usual
response o f t h e England cricket t e a m in
t h e s e c i r c u m s t a n c e s - w i n a m a t c h .
Decent batting f r o m skipper Alec Stew-
art, relieved of the wicket-keeping duties,
gave England a d e c e n t score. Darren
G o u g h then b o w l e d s o m e o f the most
hostile fast b o w l i n g I have seen by an
English bowler, a n d Australia's batting
was finally b l o w n away for once, giving
England a 12 run victory, after t h e hosts
w e r e s e e m i n g l y cruising to the win. I his
set up the possibility o f England squaring
the series in Sydney. A l t h o u g h the
p i t c h e d t u r n e d s q u a r e a n d W a r n e
returned to play alongside the impressive
McGill, England did not play badly, but a
poor decision by the IV replay umpire
giving Slater in w h e n he w a s clearly out
eventually cost England t h e match.
So a l t h o u g h I a m pleased m y prediction
from N o v e m b e r (3-1 to Australia) c a m e
out right, it is d i s a p p o i n t i n g to only see
England playing well w h e n they have
already c o n c e d e d t h e series. O n the
bright sides England surely .start as o n e
of the favourites for this summer's cricket
World C u p , with conditions giving the
host side a distinct advantage.
