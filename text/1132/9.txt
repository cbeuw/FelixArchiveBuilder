Fiction
18 January 1999
Unfortunately though, she managed
to blackmail m y m o t h e r into silence
because m y m o t h e r - as y o u k n o w
- is as i n c o n t i n e n t as a sieve. By
coincidence M r s . C r o w was the only
one f r o m their g r o u p to k n o w this
and therefore she threatened to
make it public if m y m o t h e r spilled
the beans a b o u t her. It's quite sad
really."
Both lay in silence for a while,
but Henry noted with satisfaction
that Stella was s m i l i n g slightly.
"It's totally true, y o u k n o w , " he
said. " N o w I'll tell y o u a b o u t M r s .
Chambers. Y o u r e m e m b e r her, she's
the one that told y o u all a b o u t her
son. You will have f o u n d n o t h i n g
unusual about that, in fact it's an
interesting and very t o u c h i n g story.
But had y o u had another conversa-
tion with her y o u ' l l have f o u n d that
she w o u l d have said all the same
things, because her son is all she
talks about. She is infatuated with
her son, her son's legacy is the rea-
son for her life.
" N o w y o u ' l l think that even
though that m i g h t be slightly eccen-
tric, y o u can't hold it against her, see-
ing what this son of hers d i d . Well,
I'm telling y o u that everything that
she told y o u - everything that she
tells anyone in fact - is m a d e up, a
figment of her imagination."
Stella coughed. "Henry, h o w can
y o u be so sure of this?"
"I'm telling y o u , it's the truth
and n o t even m y m o t h e r k n o w s
about this. I heard f r o m a very reli-
able source, but that's another story.
Anyway, the only true fact in her
story is that her son was in the 24th
b o m b e r s q u a d r o n f r o m 1941
o n w a r d s . After that the fiction
begins. He never saved two w o u n d e d
comrades by single handedly flying
their plane back with a bullet in his
lung. Neither did he s h o o t d o w n 12
G e r m a n fighters. A n d least of all, he
was never p o s t h u m o u s l y awarded
the DFC. He did die d u r i n g the war,
b u t n o t by c r a s h i n g his aircraft
through an e n e m y b o m b e r f o r m a -
tion. He died whilst he was on leave,
at h o m e , w i t h his m o t h e r , M r s ,
Chambers."
" O h m y G o d , what h a p p e n e d ? "
"It's so awful. He was having a
shower when he m u s t have stepped
o n a bar of soap, or something. He
slipped over and cracked his head on
the hot water tap. O n e hour later his
m o t h e r f o u n d water d r i p p i n g onto
the kitchen table, because her son
was lying facedown in the plughole.
He had d r o w n e d and she had a ner-
vous breakdown immediately after-
wards. 1 d o n ' t think she ever quite
recovered c o m p l e t e l y . " H e n r y
paused, almost respectfully, before
carrying o n . "As far as 1 know, only
three people alive today k n o w about
this incident."
A g a i n they lay in silence for
awhile, before H e n r y started u p
again.
" N o w I'll tell y o u about the last
secret, and this time n o b o d y next
d o o r - not even the person it c o n -
cerns - knows about it. It concerns
M r s . W i l s o n , she's the one that y o u
were talking to before y o u left. N o w
she is a particularly unpleasant char-
acter but, as fate will have it, is also
fabulously wealthy. She owns a large
house in Stissex w h i c h contains
m a n y valuable items of furniture,
especially a very important collection
of paintings. She has a son w h o is the
single heir to this considerable estate
and w h o also happens to be very
g o o d friends with J o h n f r o m last
week, remember? That's h o w I k n o w
all this. Anyway, this son of hers is
n o t really into his antiques and just
wants to sell the whole lot and make
a few profitable investments. N o w
o u r M r s . W i l s o n was very ill at one
stage and everyone - including her
son - assumed that it was the end of
the milk run for her. He and his
brokers began to make elaborate
plans for the m o n e y b u t were
thwarted w h e n she m a d e a c o m -
plete recovery. That was seven years
ago. He is, understandably 1 s u p -
pose, quite bitter - and she knows it.
O n e year ago, purely out of spite she
gave away an extremely precious
painting from her collection to some
obscure gallery. Her son f o u n d out
and hit the roof but there was n o t h -
ing he could d o about it of course.
Then, however, he contrived a bril-
liant plan: he correctly assumed that
his m o t h e r w o u l d make similar gifts
to various other causes so he c o m -
missioned an artist to make copies of
all the valuable paintings in the col-
lection, w h i c h was basically all of
them. Then he carried o u t several
clandestine m i s s i o n s into his
m o t h e r s house, at night of course,
and replaced the original canvases
with the copies, whilst leaving the
frames. His m o t h e r is, 1 believe, a lit-
tle fuzzy in the optical d e p a r n n e n t s o
the w h o l e t h i n g w o r k e d liked a
d r e a m . I've been i n f o r m e d that he's
n o w stripping the house of tapesn-ies
a n d ceramics."
Stella burst into her bright laugh-
ter and Henry too was infected. They
kissed briefly and then for longer,
and then for longer still. But Henry
suddenly started.
" W h a t ' s the matter?"
"Stella, whilst we were in there
y o u had the baby-phone out." His
voice was entirely different n o w ,
deadpan and o m i n o u s , " W h e r e is it
n o w ? "
" W h y , it's here in m y pocket".
W h a t followed was a brief rustle of
bedclothes and garments and then a
deep silence. Stella was the first to
speak.
"It m u s t have fallen to the floor"
A slight t r e m o r was unmistakably
present in her voice. Slowly she
raised herself and peered over the
edge of the bed.
