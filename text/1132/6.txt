W
ell, here w e are again, happy as
can b e . Unless, o f course, y o u
are o n e o f t h e u n f o r t u n a t e s
w h o have exams to d o as w e speak, for
w h i c h y o u have m y sympathy. I h o p e
that you all h a d a g o o d Christmas, afford-
ing y o u the opportunity to recharge t h e
batteries prior to getting annihilated o n
N e w Year's Eve. For my part, as is n o w tra-
ditional, I ventured to a little s h i n d i g at
Alexandra Palace, b o p p i n ' the night away
with all y o u youngsters (though I w a s sur-
prised a n d d i s a p p o i n t e d to s e e virtually
n o b o d y else f r o m IC there). D a m n fine
evening, a n d well w o r t h the charge o f
interfering with the Royal M a i l that w a s
nearly brought against a g o o d friend o f
m i n e , w h o b e c a m e l o c k e d in a mail
r o o m in pursuit o f tickets for said event.
It's a long story, the details o f w h i c h c a n
be recounted if y o u cross m y p a l m with
bitter.
So far, as is to be expected, it's b e e n
a bit quiet at Imperial. It is reassuring to
see that Estates' passion for signs is not
diminished as w e a p p r o a c h the millen-
n i u m . The b i g silver installation outside
the BMS is certainly a departure f r o m the
blue ones, both in colour a n d legibility;
I w a s b e g i n n i n g to think that m y eyes
were g o i n g , but since I only h a d t h e m
checked a fortnight ago, it must the grey
o n grey colour c o m b i n a t i o n . Still, w e
can't have the m e d i c s s l u m m i n g it with
the blue efforts. Perhaps it will be easier
to read w h e n it has b e e n gilded a n d
encrusted with d i a m o n d s . T h e U n i o n
seems to have achieved a bit o f a victory
in its battle for a n e w licence, giving the
building a sensible fire limit. Hopefully
this will m e a n a n e n d to the paranoid
officiousness displayed by s o m e o f t h e
stewards, w h o s e uncharacteristic behav-
iour w a s so over the t o p as to be l a u g h -
able. Congratulations to all c o n c e r n e d .

With that milestone out the way, y o u can
n o w focus your efforts o n serving c o n -
sistently g o o d beer, a slightly bigger
undertaking, I'll wager.
The Euro, for the benefit of those liv-
ing o n Mars o f late, has n o w arrived, with
m o r e of a w h i m p e r than a bang. Despite
the ludicrous p r o n o u n c e m e n t s by vari-
o u s E u r o p e a n politicians, w h o pro-
c l a i m e d it a s u c c e s s after t w o hours
t r a d i n g , it is
far t o o early
to tell if it will
be successful.

rency d e s i g n e d to insulate Europe f r o m
the m e n a c e o f globalisation. It is almost
t o u c h i n g that grown-up p e o p l e still hold
such ridiculous views. The Germans have

also m a d e no secret of their desire to use
the single currency as a tool to achieve
tax 'harmonisation.' For the uninitiated,
this is an ingenious plan that enables
G e r m a n y to sustain its crippling rates o f
c o r p o r a t e taxation by i m p o s i n g a n
equally d a m a g i n g r e g i m e o n the rest of

The shifting sands o f sovereignty
(first issue of the year, a n d he's started
alliterating) will b e an issue this year
within the loose confederation o f tribes
that is Imperial. M o v e s are again afoot to
tinker with the CCUs, a topic w h i c h has
given gainful e m p l o y m e n t to sabbati-
cals since t h e d a w n o f time. W h e n e v e r
this issue c o m e s up, it inevitably stirs
great p a s s i o n s in all o f a b o u t half a
d o z e n p e o p l e across the c a m p u s . Even
by Imperial standards, the s u p r e m e indif-
ference that greets any such efforts is
incredible, a n d very telling. The recent
history of the CCUs has not b e e n a happy
o n e , d o m i n a t e d by c o c k u p s a n d people
elected o n a democrati c m a n d a t e o f a
c o u p l e o f percent o f College m e m b e r s ,
w h o are incapable o f running a bath, let
alone the RCSU, C & G U a n d so forth. The
p r o b l e m stems f r o m the fact that the
p e o p l e r u n n i n g t h e s e a u g u s t b o d i e s
s e e m to s e e their organisations as rivals
to ICU. Consequently, they establish vast
n u m b e r s o f posts for t h e most trivial
tasks, with w h i c h they n e e d not c o n -
cern themselves. C C U s s e e k to dupli-
cate all aspects o f the U n i o n , so w e
have welfare officers, a c a d e m i c affairs
officers etc etc. Such over-representa-
tion merely generates m o r e paperwork
a n d c o m m i t t e e m e e t i n g s with precious
little tangible benefit for students. The
clubs issue raised by the ICU President is
less controversial, t h o u g h o n balance
they w o u l d lose n o n e o f their identity
a n d it w o u l d purely m a k e things simpler
to administer. As it is, the only activities
that t h e C C U s n e e d worry a b o u t arc
cnts, principally in Freshers' w e e k , their
publications, h o w e v e r execrable they
may be, a n d a l u m n i relations. Leaner
organisations, stripped o f t h e legions of
s e l f - o p i n i o n a t e d b o r e s s o lacking in
organisational skills that they couldn't
e v e n find gainful e m p l o y within ICU,
w o u l d over t i m e b e c o m e m o r e popular
a n d successful, rather than the pitiful
s h a d o w s o f their former selves that they
are at the m o m e n t .
Presidential Talk-Back
Since the b e g i n n i n g of term, the U n i o n
has b e e n i n u n d a t e d w i t h c o m p l a i n t s
a b o u t t h e L o n d o n Transport s c h e m e
(thank you Michelle for giving half o f your
time to them.) Applications have b e e n
lost, rejected, stolen a n d as a result stu-
dents are having to part with b u d g e t e d
money. Having complained several times
verbally, in letters a n d t h r o u g h the U L U
chain to t h e c o m p a n y w i t h n o joy, I
decided to try and track d o w n the source
of their p r o b l e m s .
There are very f e w lines o f c o m -
plaint for students; the t e l e p h o n e service
is ineffective; y o u can find out w h e t h e r
or not your a p p l i c a t i o n has b e e n
processed or rejected, but c o m p l a i n t s
are never l o g g e d or recorded a n d the
phrase 'brick wall' springs to m i n d . I
spoke for quite a long time to o n e o f the
operators, m a k i n g t h e m e x p l a i n t h e
shambles a n d of course there w e r e 'vary-
ing reasons.' T h e

c o u l d b e a d o d g y
p o s t m a n taking all
of the e n v e l o p e s to
m a k e a bit o f cash
b e f o r e they reach
LT. The solution to
this is to s e n d your
a p p l i c a t i o n s in a
w h i t e e n v e l o p e . I
also f o u n d out that
they a c c e p t
c h e q u e s , just m a k e
t h e m o u t to L o n -
d o n Transport. Lf
also b l a m e d t h e
mail h o u s e ; the forms are processed at
LT, checking whether they are valid or not
and then the information is sent onto the
mailing h o u s e w h o send out the cards.
David Hellard, ICU President
Next year there is
doubt as to whether
the s a m e m a i l i n g
h o u s e will b e used;
let's just h o p e not.
This d o e s still not
account for the time
periods f r o m s e n d -
ing a letter off to the
rejection letter or
the high n u m b e r o f
' i n a d e q u a t e ' appli-
cations.
There are still
s o m e issues that
n e e d to be settled
with L o n d o n Trans-
port, the most obvi-
ous b e i n g access to the s c h e m e for all
students (not just u n d e r 25s) a n d a n
increase in the period that the card is
usable to all twelve m o n t h s o f the year,
as PhD a n d clinical medicine students are
still s t u d y i n g . H o p e f u l l y t h e s e will be
resolved by the e n d of the year within
the University o f L o n d o n U n i o n .
Until then if y o u have a complaint
the best t h i n g to d o is to write to Den-
nis Torycliff, C h i e f Executive, L o n d o n
Transport, 55 B r o a d w a y L o n d o n SW1
HOBD a n d c o p y t h e letter to Richard
Parry, M a r k e t P l a n n i n g if y o u ' r e extra
k e e n .
If y o u did not received a card within
the usual 28 days a n d have lost m o n e y
because o f this, or if y o u have bought
weekly Travel cards instead o f a monthly
o n e in the expectation that your card
w o u l d c o m e within the next f e w w e e k s
a n d h a v e c o n s e q u e n t l y lost m o n e y
please email m e with the a m o u n t and

receive e n o u g h letters I've got a stunt up
my sleeve that might have s o m e effect.
