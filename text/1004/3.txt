Spot the Spoof Story 3
Hot, Sticky Summer Ftang Ftang
BYE BYE
The College yawned today as it
became apparent that nothing at all
was happening. Felix reporters
limping back to base seemed in
poor spirits. "It isn't like a war out
there," said one hack.
In an attempt to unravel the
mystery we probed the sleeping
Professor Whizbang, of the ghostlike
Physics department, for more details.
"Well," he said, "It may that entropy
is no longer breaking down. The
universe may have reached the nadir
of its cyclic contractions. Or it may
indicate that everyone has buggered
off home for the summer."
But Dr Beardy-Glasses, a logician
in the mathematics department
contested our findings: "No news is
good news. Therefore, there is news."
Miss Lucy Choke-Her snarled:
"Sleeping? Who, me? Not me g'vner."
Dan, Lucy and a somewhat mysterious hand
Whispers have reached Felix that
President-elect Lucy Choccy-
Biscuit and Deputy President-elect
'Desperate' Dan Look are said to
have been spending a lot of time in
each others' company.
Associates report long late-night
phone calls between the pair and
they have been spotted leaving each
others' homes in the early hours.
Care to comment, Dan? Lucy?
Eager for the salubrious details, we
tried to contact the alleged love
birds for their comments on the
rumours we're so blatantly
propagating. Of course, they denied
everything...or at least they would
have if we 'd actually reached them.
Isn't sabbatical co-operation
wonderful?
Jon Jordan's Beard
BY THE SEASIDE
Tintin, erstwhile Music Editor of
Felix who also parades under the
name 'J. Jordan', was found last
night sobbing in a pool of tears.
His grief was caused by the
defeat of his appendage, a small
rust-coloured 'goatee' effect, in the
elections for the Felix Mascot. The
eventual winner was a bog brush
reclining under the toilet. Mr Brush
caused controversy during the
campaign with his posters, which
the 'goatee' claimed were blatantly
misrepresentative. They featured
the brush slapped over Tintin's face
with the caption "What difference?"
emboldened beneath. The poster
was withdrawn when a poll
revealed that 9/10 voters couldn't
see any likeness. The tenth, 'Mr J',
insisted there was "No similarity at
all!" before punching me in the
face. Miss Chicken Chow-Mein
also declined to shave.
