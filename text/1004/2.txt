Doctors Suspended at St Mary's
BY JOE MCFADDEN
Two surgeons at St Mary's
Hospital have been suspended after
accusations of the unnecessary
removal of a man's voice-box and
a women's breast.
Consultant Solomon Abramo-
vitch was suspended in May after
Vincent Oliver, aged 68, had his
voice-box removed when cancer
was suspected.
Mr Abramovitch made the
initial diagnosis but the operation
was handled by another surgeon.
Later the tumour was found to be
benign and a formal apology was
given to Mr Oliver who is now
unable to speak properly.
An inquiry is underway to
decide whether the voice-box was
removed unnecessarily and
establish Mr Abramovitch's role in
the matter. Mr Oliver is
considering whether to sue the
hospital. He said: "I am absolutely
disgusted and I will make sure they
pay for how they have left me."
Mrs Mary Ghilchik, a
consultant general surgeon at St
Mary's Hospital, was also
suspended in March after a patient
of hers had a mastectomy even
though no cancer was present.
Mrs Ghilchik maintains that the
patient had requested the operation
herself and that the complaint was
made by the patient's relatives.
"I have been a consultant 24
years and am known for the
preservation of the breast" said
Mrs Ghilchik.
An internal inquiry into Mrs
Ghilchik's conduct in the case has
been completed and an external
inquiry has begun.
Huddersfield University Heads Resign

The announcement earlier this

The Annual General Meeting of
Imperial College Union last Friday
was attended by less than fifty
people. This means that under one
per cent of students at Imperial
were present for the one time the
Union Sabbaticals and other Union
Officers account for their
achievements during the year.
On this occasion, however,
accountability seemed to be
something of a taboo subject. An
attempt to introduce a motion
censuring ICU president Andy
Wensley was rejected by UGM
chair Paul Thomas (Felix 1003).
The motion had originally been
proposed by Royal College of

confidence motion was supported
by 935 of the total of 954
university staff.
The Vice Chancellor, Professor
Kenneth Durrands (65), announced
his early retirement from the post
after having built up the former
polytechnic from 2,200 students in
1970 to a current total of 12,000
students. He also saw the
Picton, in response to claims of
widespread disapproval of Mr
Wensley's handling of the
constitution during the year. Mr
Thomas refused to allow the
motion to be discussed under Any
Other Business, suggesting that
nothing constructive would come
from such a discussion.
Mr Thomas added that if the
meeting disagreed, it could no
confidence him as UGM Chair,
which no one attempted. He also
described this year's UGMs as "a
crock of shit".
The AGM also ratified the
elections of David Goddard to the
post of Transport Officer, and
Gareth Bellamy and Ed Cortis as
Alternative Prospective Editors.
A motion was then passed

institution join the group of
Britain's newest universities. He
was due to retire in 1996.
The vote of no confidence
happened after a year of protests
from staff and students over losing
their places on the university's
governing council. After the vote,
Professor Durrands was asked to
"consider his position" by the local
Rag slogan. The slogan, 'Muff
Dive 95', was chosen by Rag
members at an official meeting.
The Rag Committee has already
received a letter objecting to the
slogan, which the sender felt was
offensive. Any offense caused
would, according to next year's
Rag Committee, be counter-
productive to Rag's main purpose
of raising money for charity.
It was pointed out from the
floor that, in the light of this year's
slogan, 'Fungal Spore 94', to pass
the motion would suggest that ICU
finds oral sex more offensive than
the abuse of hallucinogenic
substances.
The revised slogan for next year
will be chosen at another rag
meeting.

The President of the university
council, Dr Peter Fielden, said:
"He has reached a point when it
makes sense to step aside for a new

The Chancellor of the

announced his resignation, saying
he could not ignore the referendum.
Fair Play?

The Imperial College Sports Centre
will be altering its prices on 1st
January 1995.
As yet, no details of the new
prices have been given, but some
students have predicted they will
continue to favour South
Kensington residents in setting
prices for all users of the Sports
Centre.
Any comments about planned
changes should be directed towards
the Sports Centre, or alternatively
you could talk to one of next year's
Sabbatical officers in the Union
Office.
