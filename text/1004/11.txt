Opinion 11
Editorial
Those of you fortunate enough to get hold of
this issue of Felix will notice that it is not in
quite the normal form. This is because, for the
third time in almost as many weeks the litho has
broken down, making it impossible to produce
Felix in the normal way. Instead, we have spent
the whole of today photocopying as many
copies as possible. At a rough estimate, only
about 400 will make it into the departments.
Anyway, onto other things. Like the attempt
at a no confidence motion at last week's AGM.
Why was it left so late? But then it wouldn't
have achieved much would it?. Andy Wensley
would have been supervised during the
handover period and that would have been
about it. If Lucy has any sense she won't trust
anything he tells her in the next month and will
find everything out from people who know what
they're talking about.
Sadly, Felix this year has let Mr Wensley
have a very easy time of it. We should have
reported on his mistakes much earlier than we
did. I started the year letting his first few
mistakes pass unnoticed, thinking foolishly that

he needed to settle in and find his feet. I also
felt that slagging the Union off from the start
would give a bad impression to first years,
putting them off getting involved in anything to
do with the Union. But it doesn't seem to have
made any difference. Look at the attendance at
the UGMs, or at how difficult it has been to fill
all the Officer posts these past months.
Also, the Felix news team unfortunately
consisted of people with no previous experience
in the Union and Union politics, people who
had no real desire to show up all the errors and
no knowledge of how it should be done. I am
not a news reporter and so I lacked the ability to
show them what to do.
But, as time went on, things got worse. Andy
made more and more mistakes and all people
did about it was sit around and moan amongst
themselves. The people who proposed and
supported the no confidence motion had been
talking about it for months. Why oh why didn't
they do something about it earlier. Then maybe
the Union could have been something worth
bothering with.
The Truth...?
Dear Beccy,
I am somewhat reticent to finally admit it,
but Felix has fallen victim to an hilarious ruse.
As my good friend Simon Baker (a pseudonym:
his real name is Sheldon) mentioned in his saga
of spoof letters, the puny reporting of the
procedural ranglings (sickening) over the
constitution completely failed to get to the
bottom of the story. The bottom itself was of
course Mr Baker, and he continued to produce
what bottoms do for far too long. I am sorry.
Had I known he was such an absurd gasbag I
would never have involved him in my master
plan. And I thought it was so clever.
Yours sincerely,
Mike Ingram.

Too Mild?
Dear Beccy,
Yet again you have been too restrained in
your editorial comment.
Simon Baker is an immature prat and he has
almost no understanding of his chosen subjects.
What's more he completely ignores or fails to
understand the response which he aims to
generate from his letters. His incessant rambling
and insatiable whining go to show just how
grossly ignorant he is. What's more they make
terribly boring reading.
With reference to my crossword competition
feature which he keeps bringing up, like most of
my exploits, it was conducted tongue-in-cheek.
Not for thefirsttime I'm sure, the joke is on him.
Doo-ee,
