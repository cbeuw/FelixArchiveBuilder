DEP. PRESIDENT New Election proposed by Anon
Many thanks to all those who voted for me last time.
I was thrilled to win the post of Deputy President, but
all of the fun was in the race. I enjoyed it so much
last time that I have decided to run again.
I am pictured opposite in true chameleon style. My
looks may change, but my policies have not. I stand
for the right to choose. If you elect me as Deputy
President again, I can promise even more.
i)A rerun of the election.
iilThe nervous breakdown of the FELIX Editor and the
Honorary Secretary.
iiilLess bullshit from the DP next year.
On a more personal note, I promise not to:
Get legless in the Union Bar just before freshers'
week.
Put my hair in a stupid pony tail.
Write extremely naff advertisements for the Union
outlets, which outline them selling 'handy things.'
Culture a binful of dead beer cans in my room.
Be Welsh.
Remember. Vote NEW ELECTION 1 on Monday 30th
April and May 1st.
