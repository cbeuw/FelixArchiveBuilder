18th September 1992 Felix 941
Beit
Back
Winter is over in the People's
Republic of Imperial College Union
and spring is about to burst into full
bloom as the new year starts. For
the sabbaticals the lazy period of
their one year tour of duty is over
and the new year is about to start.
So have the 'new' sabbaticals been
broken-in and house trained by their
respective members of staff?
Mr Beavan hasn't done any
whoopsies on the carpet since the
last issue of Felix 6 weeks ago, but
my, that was a biggie. One potential
law suit that was thankfully cleared
up, and an irate U L U President
complaining about blatant breaches
of their staff protocol. Naturally,
we apologised and explained that
we had never received a copy of it.
Felix attempted to obtain a copy
earlier this week, only to be
informed that said article was
'under negotiation'.
The whole issue of staff protocol
is bound to crop up every Friday.
Although there are reasons behind
staff protocols, it would seem from
last year's evidence that they are
invoked to cover up any and many
potentially embarrassing situations.
Recent press reports concerning the
Dianagate tapes and the Mellor
football fantasies have not been
received with a mass call for a
'Royal Protocol' or a 'Minister for
Fun Protocol'. National media
personalities must regrettably
accept that their personal lives could
appear in the popular press in the
public interest. Most people agree*
with this principle, the question is
what is in 'the public interest'.
Student Unions are a microcosm
of the real world. We have our own
government, our own elected
representatives, our own civil
service, our own laws, discipline
system, and our own shops. It is
therefore up to the main media in
this union and college to conduct
themselves responsibly.
No one has published which
members of college management
have been sleeping with each other
(or discussing which football strip
they wear in bed), though we would
have no hesitation in doing so if
there was a whiff of financial
irregularity. Similarly, what
sabbaticals get' up to in their own
private rooms is up to their own
conscience and the Metropolitan
Police, if they get caught. However,
their activities when they are
representing the Union, or in the
Union building, is well within the
student's right to know.
Details of the staff/sabbatical
working relationship may be
common knowledge amongst the
regular users of Union facilities,
though the rest of the students
remain in ignorance. Under a staff
protocol they would have no right
to know how the sabbaticals and
staff are working, and working
together, but yet is there not a right
for the students to know how their
elected representatives are
behaving?

Dear Editor,
Thank you for sending me the
July issue of FELIX. Unfortunately
there are two comments I must
make about the article 'Sabbaticals
asked to leave'.
The first is that the article
insinuated that the Sabbaticals were
asked to leave by the University of
London (ULU). The officers were,
in fact, requested to leave by the
member of Wye College staff
responsible for the course's
accommodation.
My second disapprobation is that
the article referred to members of
staff by name. This is a serious
breach of the consuetude which
staff consider requisite to working
in a Students' Union.
I hope FELIX will publish an
apology for acting unprofessionally.
Yours faithfully,
Mark Samuels, President.

Dear Mr Beavan,
There is no need for a student
newspaper to be benign; ruffling the
feathers of those presumed to be in
authority is part of an ancient
tradition. I do think however that
you should have commitment to
factual accuracy. You owe this to
your readers—students, staff,
governors. Your front page article
in the 31 July issue contained
numerous errors of fact—facts
which were readily available had
you preferred them to fiction. I will
touch on just two, both relating to

Neither Mr Stuart Lipton nor his

The College has not abandoned
the intention of purchasing Furse

if we can acquire the property at a
realistic price. The agents acting for
the owners, the Ministry of
Defence, are fully aware of our
