Hecuba, Pic by Simon Annand
H e c u b a
Continuing the series of six plays
for Europe, the Gate Theatre
presents an excellent performance
of Hecuba. Written by Euripides
around 425BC is a complex and
passionate story of the impact of
immense suffering on the human
soul. After the end of the Trojan
war Hecuba, Queen of Troy, and
the Trojan women are transported
to Greece to face a lifetime of
slavery. After losing her city, her
husband and all but two of her
children during the war now she
loses her dauther Polyxena,
sacrificed by the Greeks to satisfy
the ghost of Achilles. Her youngest
son is killed by the King of Thrace,
a friend in the past who is only
worried about his own prosperity
Ariadne—Rita Cullis, and the buffa
character Zerbinetta. At this point
ENO's revival sensibly withdraws
all extraneous characters allowing
the inspired music to unfold without
the rumbustiousness favoured
elsewhere in the Prologue. Also
prominent is the agile-voiced,
Dancing Master (Anthony Mee
pictured).
The set is appropriately
makeshift. Indeed, elaborate
scenery is unnecessary when
Ariadne's opening monologue
receives a performance of the
calibre of that given by Janice
now. So Hecuba forced to the brink
of human despair, finally seeks
revenge.
Ann Mitchell is excellent in her
performance as Hecuba. She
manages to get through to the
audience all the pain and suffering
Hecuba goes through. The chorus
of Trojan women stands by her and
fills the small theatre with songs of
sorrow. The style of the play is
remarkably rhetorical and there is
a considerable amount of music and
song. It belongs to the group of
plays which explore the character
of individuals driven to extremes by
immense suffering. A highly
recommended play for this season.

Cairns. Cynthia Sieden sacrifices
only a little impetus to bring
breathtaking precision to
Zerbinetta's aria.
The firm tenor of Alan Woodrow
copes admirably with the taxing
music of Bacchus, although slightly
squeezed on the highest notes.
Conductor Alexander Sander
unearths the subtleties of Strauss's
scoring, while not stinting the more
Wagnerian moments.

A colourful paperback about the life
and times of a certain Doreen Spink
(Mrs), that is written in an almost
thought mode giving the impression
of a diary made public reading. This
is strange, but then the whole book
is a bit pear shaped anyway. The
story line is of a middle aged
woman whose husband has an
affair. After the two are reconciled
the husband chooses voluntary
redundancy, their unpleasant next
door neighbour's son promptly
dies, they move to a small village
in Norfolk and the rest of the book
continues in this medium with
unfolding minor upsets and
mishaps. A slow starting book with
no amazing storyline or direction,
but strangely interesting - possibly
human nature creates fascination
with someone else's problems for
a change... Not an amazing read but
if you happen to have a few hours
to spare and nothing else to do, try
it.

S o m e t h i n g Blue
Life is going great for Lucy; her
long-term relationship with her
boyfriend, Jasper, her illustrating
work just about to reach the big
time, her best friend Julia, an
apartment-sitter with acting
ambitions.
Then an old college friend (a
loosely-used term) turns up on her
doorstep having left her husband-
to-be on the morning of their
wedding, leaving a note for her
sister reading "If I stay here and do
this I think I might die." Something
Blue is a part-emotional, part-
humorous account of three women
in New York, their friendships with
each other, their relationships and
their experiences in the world.
It is an easy-to-read book
(although written in a weird tense)
which is, at times, impossible to put
down. Definitely a good read.

My advice to any one with a
personality and a brain is: Do not
bother to buy this book.
I'm sorry but I was not
impressed, or amused or even
enthralled. I was expecting some
kind of analytical review of Gotti,
his life and times; what I discovered
was a transcript of a set of 'tapes'
that were supposedly Mr. Gotti
talking about his feelings. Even the
exciting revelation that it included
a testimony by someone called
Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano could
not encourage me to read beyond
the first page.
However if any body else would
like a copy of this book please
contact us in Felix, there is one
going free.
