Samin Ishtiaq examines the ethics of the education of scientists. While David Spooner replies, making
gratuitous use of Oscar Wilde.
Perhaps Stephen Hawking's book,
A Brief History of Time, re-started
the whole debate. The last part of
the book, with its 'ominous'
prediction about cosmologists
discovering the mind of god,
brought out orthodoxy and radical
alike. We are now showered with
more books, articles, even T V
series (BBC2's Pandora's Box)
about the place of science in
society. Is science evil? Has science
corrupted our souls?
This is an old debate, of course,
probably unlikely to be resolved.
Mainly, I think, because the whole
debate about the 'goodness' and
'badness' of science and technology
is on the wrong plane. We may as
well be arguing about the weight of
yellow. Science, like Oscar Wilde's
Robert Pursig
describes it best
'science is a
pile of amoral
objective
matter.'
Art, is not moral or immoral.
Robert Pirsig (whose latest book
Li7a was opinioned-at recently in
this column) describes it best:
'science is a pile of amoral objective
matter'. In other words, science just
is. Pirsig, in fact, links the current
moral confusion to the fact that
scientific analysis, having led the
intellectual revolution in the 60s, is
not able to deal with morality.
But this does not mean that
science should not be criticised
(Although Joe Schwarz describes
the lack of critics of Science in his
article 'Defiance of Science'
(Guardian 13th June 1992). Just
because no moral analysis of
science can take place does not
mean that it should be left to get on
with itself. One of the main reasons
for this is that science is powerful.
This cannot be overstated enough.
The ability of science to alter the
structure of society within the
medium term (say 50-100 years) is
awesome; the Pill has given woman
physical freedom, the machine gun
has given a soldier massive fire-
power; robots have replaced entire
communities of work-forces; the
car has altered the way Western
society thinks and functions. There
is little in anyone's life that is not
connected with what scientists and
engineers did some years ago.
Not that these examples are of a
sociological nature. They affect the
fundamentals of society. Whether
Newtonian physics is overturned
here is of no concern. Whether
computers use silicon chips or
gallium arsenide ones doesn't
matter. It's the long-term effect on
society that is important.
For this reason alone scientists
need to be—must be—taught an
alternative view of science. They
need to be aware of what science
does to society. It is not enough to
teach them the history and
philosopy of science; they must be
taught a sociological analysis of the
impact of science. This is not just
to silence critics of the scientific
establishment by arming the
scientists (that would be a very
destructive reason) but to make the
scientist think about what he/she is
about to do.
And this is the key point of this
article: scientific establishments like
Imperial College produce 'well-
behaved' scientists. Scientists who
are not aware—not taught? not
willing?—of what studying science
does to the community. Scientists
who are unaware of the history of
science from a 'small man's' point
of view.
Perhaps there is some kind of
vicious circle here: industry wants
well-behaved engineers and
institutions want industry's funds
and goodwill. I am not suggesting
a conspiracy; I am neither a fanatic
Marxist nor of the new breed of
Green terrorists. I am just
mentioning the possible instance of
a destructive relationship between
those who demand scientists
(industry, government, education)
and those who supply them
(institutions like Imperial). The fact
that some spaced-out theory like a
capitalist-technocrat conspiracy
should even be mentioned is even
more reason to support the
Imperial College Ltd.
for well behaved engineers
education of a reasoned,
sympathetic scientist.
Of course, institutions will say
that they already run 'humanities'
courses for their scientists. But
giving a third-year undergraduate a
humanitites option is not enough.
There are several reasons for this.
For one, what will stop the student
from studying Friedman on
economics rather than Karl Popper
on scientific discovery? Our student
will think: which of these
humanities courses will look good
on my CV? Which course will give
me 'useful' background to the 'real'
world? Is a business studies course
easier than a philosopy one?
For another, and this reason is
more pertinent, by the third year
our student has already become a
trained (brain-washed even?)
scientist. He/she works with 'nice'
theories, which always have
reasons, answers, connections,
measurements. Is it now possible
for him/her to go back and question
the very need for his/her
knowledge?
The point about inadequate
scientists has been made. I think a
solution lies in scientists learning
about relevant humanities subjects.
And learning about them when it
matters. For instance, for a
Computing Sciences student,
'relevant subjects' would mean
courses with topics like 'The ethics
of programming', 'Public and
Private: the ethics of iprivacy',
'Automation and Alienation'.
He/she could even be taught general
courses in philosopy and sociology.
But it is definitely not enough just
to tell him/her to be mindful of the
Data Protection and Computer
Misuse Acts; the underlying
philosophic ideas of privacy and
hacking should be understood. And
by 'when it matters' I mean early
on—quite definitely in the first
year—before a scientific mode has
been fitted-on the student's brain.
'Sure, good idea', people will
say. 'But aren't our courses already
overloaded?' But what can you say
about a university year that is based
on some archaic Church calender (I
refer to Michaelmas, Easter, etc
terms)? And how come Norwegian
universities manage to run
compulsory philosophy courses for
all undergraduates? And what is
more important: a better
understanding of and more
integration with Nature? O r
alienisation of and purpose-less
science?
We can forgive a man for making
a useful thing as long as he does
not admire it. The only excuse for
making a useless thing is that one
admires it intensely.
Herein is a value statement. It
is from the preface to 'The
Picture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar
Wilde, where Wilde outlines the
principles of aestheticism. A
value is a property of that which
belongs to a system of ethics, or
what we call 'good'. With this in
mind, what, then, is perception
worth?
Science is a human-devised
system of discerning and limiting
universal laws of which we
perceive little, it is part of the
progression of humanity and its
societies, and is as valuable to
some societies as it is worthless to
others. That some would consider
it worthless is not in doubt, and
then we have something which is
of a similar value structure to art.
Therefore, I will not patronise my
audience, by telling them they
need to study philosophy to
parallel their science-based
intellectual development, as
philosophy is not adequately
proficient at dealing with ethics.
No more so, at least, than our
systems of law which are already
evident to the senses and require
only our adherence.
Though I can offer no alternative,
greater awareness predicates a
clouding of the issue within the
philosophy of ethics. The
structure of this article is my
point; I have demonstrated here
exactly how useful philosophy is.
A business studies course
probably is easier, and will no
doubt be far more useful in a free
market arena. The price of
everything, and the value of
nothing; more fool him that
studies something of value.
The article opposite suggests
that scientists need to observe
science from another viewpoint,
i.e., the layman's, in order to
fully comprehend the effects of
their work, and that a course of
something like philosophy or
sociology would cover up the
perceived deficiency. That there
is a deficiency at all is the biggest
question; who, for instance is not
astute enough to recognise that
the telephone made a significant
difference to personal
communication, but is also a
limited medium that cannot
transmit interactive and non-
verbal signals, that the television
is a 'window on the world', and
brings comedy and drama into
one's own home, but is a mass
media tool despised by cultural
elitists and has been condemned
for distorting reality, that
replacement limbs are of
inestimable value to disabled
people, yet were the basic ideas
behind cybermen and other
stories of humanity dehumanising
itself. A trite example, maybe,
but one that makes a salient point
concerning human intuition, i.e.
that it is capable of interpreting
danger in the future from its
/ have
demonstrated
here exactly
how useful
philosophy
is
scientific pursuits. Granted, some
effects are recognised in
hindsight, such as acid rain
correlated to industry, but
debated material like the social
effects of virtual reality
demonstrates how society is
attempting to question all
eventualities regarding its
technology.
I may be wrong. There could
be a yawning chasm between a
scientist's knowledge, and his
perception. But how many of
you, as children, learned of
mustard gas, zyklon-B, anthrax
or the atom bomb, and imagined
that another, non-human species
had devised them? These are
human names, given to
developments within the
disciplines of chemistry, biology,
and physics. This is obvious; is it
therefore necessary that this
article, such as it is, alongside
Samin's, should exist at all? Or
is it enough that they do?
