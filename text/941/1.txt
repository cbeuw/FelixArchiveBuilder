dispute
Philippa Dodd, the President of the
Sheffield Student's Union, has
provoked great debate amongst
NUS member unions. The concern
centres around a report in The
Times stating that she had circulated
a draft proposal to Mr John Patten,
the Minister for Education and
Science, arguing that student unions
should accept the idea of voluntary
student's union membership.
Laura Matthews, NUS Press
Officier responed to the action,
cliaming it was 'short-sighted',
'naive' and even 'publicity-
seeking'. Her opinions were
reflected in many other student's
unions across the country.
Whilst there are those within
NUS member unions who would
wish to keep this whole matter
'under wraps', the publicity
surrounding Miss Dodd's proposal
has ensured that this will be
impossible. The story has been
covered in both The Independent
and The Times this week and Mark
Samuels, the President of U L U , has
called a meeting for University of
London sabbaticals to discuss a
'London response' to Miss Dodd's
proposal. The President of
Warwick Student's Union, M r Ian
Corfield, said that he was 'very
unhappy' about Miss Dodd's
actions but, didn't want to give the
story any more publicity by

speaking out. It was later revealed
that Mr Corfield had personally
phoned Miss Dodd to express his
dismay at her outspokenness.
A spokesperson for the NUS said
that they had wanted to keep the
option of voluntary membership for
when the Government made
'specific threats' towards the NUS
and this is why they have reacted
against the Sheffield University
document with such vigour. The
Spokesperson continued that this
matter was one that should be dealt
with through internal reform and
not through submitting proposals to
the government. The N U S
spokesperson felt that Miss Dodd
must have had no other motive than
self-publicity and that the proposal
from Sheffield in no way reflected
the opinions of the NUS or student
unions in general.
According to the Sheffield
Student Newspaper, Darts, of the
sabbaticals who have phoned Miss
Dodd from other universities, only
Birmingham's have expressed any
support. U L U , Durham and Bristol
student unions and National Labour
Students were all vehemently
opposedc to the submission.
When Felix tried to get in contact
with Miss Dodd she was
unavailable for comment.
However, 'one of her sabbatical
team' was able to defend their
actions. The Women's Officer,
Sara Whittiker, stood by the
proposal, saying 'it was very much
a joint decision'. Ms Whittiker
denied that anyone from Sheffield
had sent the proposal to Mr Patten,
asserting instead that the proposal
was merely a discussion document,
meant for, and solely circulated to,
NUS student unions. She said that

Imperial joins Hungary
in music tour
Imperial College Syphony Orchestra in rehersal
An east-west collaboration between
Imperial College's Symphony
Orchestra and Budapest's Academic
Choral Society has proven that
music is truly the international
language.
Starting off their joint tour in
England on Tuesday 13th
September, the two groups
performed Verdi's Requiem at the
Royal College of Music on 16th
September and then at Cambridge
University's Concert Hall on 17th
September. After that, they plan to
move on to Budapest to repeat
performence. In Hungary, the
orchestra will also perform two
other concerts with work by the
English composers Britten and
Walton along with Mahler's Fourth
Symphony.
The Imperial College Orchestra
has been long regarded as one of the
most adventurous on the student
music scene while the choir is
known as one of the finest amateur
groups in Hungary. In 1989, at the
International Eisteddfod in Wales,
the choir won the title 'Choir of the
Year'. Since many of the students
are studying science, engineering
and medicine, organisers hope that
the exchange would provide
relevant career experience to
students and further cultural links.
