The New Queer Cinema
This season celebrates all aspects of
contemporary gay and lesbian film-
making, without being judgemental.
The aim of this project seems to be
merely to present Queer Cinema to
the audience so that they form their
own opinions rather than choosing
the pieces for their artistic merits in
the first place. It presents pieces
from the brilliant, to the obscure,
to the frankly dire. The epitome of
the spirit of this venture is 'Flesh
Histories', a series of 'shorts'
shown together in two, hour-long,
programmes. All that binds these
blips of brazen film together is the
sexuality of the director/writer
and/or actors. They range from the
superb and shocking, T Object' and
'Yes Means Yes, No Means No',
through the enlightening and
educational 'Safer Sex is Hot Sex'
and 'Kissing Doesn't Kill', to the
cliched symbolism of entering
various doors, (the entirety of the
film 'Getting In').
The effect of the whole
programme is to leave you stunned,
as it is rare to see such a collection
of starkly sexual and bizarre images
in such close succession. It is worth
seeing this programme because the
good outweighs the poor and
cliched ( and you get to see some
erect penes).
The season also includes 'the
Hours and the Times', a film which
fantasizes what may have happened
between Brian Epstein and John
Lennon whilst they were on holiday
together in Barcelona. I loved the
use of the beautiful Gaudi
architecture as a backdrop for the
close but awkward relationship
between the two men. The fact that
we are still left uncertain as to how
far their relationship went, does not
diminish the impact of the film,
Music
Bone Machine, Tom Waits
'Originally I was going to take
sounds of machines I'd recorded
and add a really strong rhythmic
sense; I was going to try to build
songs out of the rhythms. But then
it didn't really develop that way.
The stories kind of took over. So
it's more bone than machine. Bone
Machine...we're all like bone
machines, I guess. We break down
eventually and we're replaced by
other models. Newer models.
Younger models. Bone
Machine...sounds like a superhero,
doesn't it?' Thus Waits describes
William Dafoe in White Sands
which transcends all the technical
difficulties they encountered to
become a rather touching vision of
human relationships. The fact that
it is about two famous people in a
real situation, which was the topic
of much contemporary debate, was
not as important to me as the way
that the film dealt with the effects
of having a close friend who is gay.
Having said this, Ian Hart is quite
a convincing Lennon and the whole
film is an interesting piece of
speculation.
The New Queer Cinema Season
also includes a conference on the
19-20th September debating and
looking critically at contemporary
gay cinema, a Bruce La Bruce film
called 'No Skin off my Ass' and a
sneak preview of 'Swoon' by Tom
Kalin.

White Sands
This film is a hell of a lot better than
the blurb suggests. Superficially, it
is about a small town cop
his first, entirely new, album since
1987's 'Frank's Wild Years', apart
from the live 'Big Time' album and
recently the soundtrack to Jim
Jarmusch's 'Night on Earth'.
He's developed a new
percussively-led grainy style which
has a homegrown, backyard feel
(Waits has used various old tape
recorders, and recorded the thing in
his own shed using various metal
objects and crowbars instead of
chains'. His subjects are more
experimental, going from 'issue-
oriented' tracks like 'Earth Died
Screaming' and the political 'In the
investigating a suspicious death and
the half a million dollars found with
the corpse. The sheriff's attempts
to solve this mystery lead him into
the seedy world of undercover FBI
agents, sultry heiresses and
international gunrunning.
The weak-sounding plot is saved
by the stunning backdrop of the
New Mexico desert and
commendable performances by
Willem Dafoe (as Deputy Sheriff,
Ray Dolezal), Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio (the horn interest) and
Sam Jackson (the 'ethnic minority
senior FBI officer without... a bug-
stain on his record'). The script has
enough pace and twists to maintain
interest and keep you guessing.
Apart from an excruciating Rodeo
scene, an even more cringe-worthy
rendition of the Star Spangled
Banner, and an overenthusiasm for
killing minor characters, this film
is surprisingly well done.

Colliseum' ('They're especially
good for an election year' jokes
Waits) to the dark storytelling songs
like 'Murder in the Red Barn' and
the demonic 'Black Wings'. Indeed,
Waits is best when telling stories,
highlighted by 'The Ocean Doesn't
Want Me'. He's still the poetic
wierdo/poet/hipster. Let him
whisper in your ear.

Christopher Columbus:
The Discovery
Land ho, or something like that.
John Glen's "Christopher
Columbus: The Discovery" has
some nice scenery and a few choice
bits of acting here and there but is
mostly a dreary retelling of the
Columbus legend. Chronicling
Columbus' first voyage to America
and the five years that preceded it,
director Glen tries to play it both
ways when it comes to the famed
explorer. Is Columbus (a handsome
but lightweight George Corraface)
the good-natured family man who
succeeds against all odds in
'discovering' America or the half-
mad zealot who terrorizes and
plunders the natives he finds there?
The movie never makes clear and
by the end, you really don't care.
Rachel Ward makes a grating
Queen Isabella but Tom Selleck
I doesn't embarrass himself too badly
as King Ferdinand. The rest of the
cast is undistinguished except for
Marlon Brando who shines as the
head of the Spanish Inquisition.

Ariadne on Naxos
The central theme of Ariadne on
Naxos is regeneration through love,
this Strauss shows by introducing
opera buffa characters into the
scenario to enliven the archaic form
of opera seria. The Prologue
explains this juxtaposition of styles.
A nouveau riche or social aspirant,
has commissioned two operas, one
serious, one comic, to entertain his
guests. At teh last moment he
decrees that the two are to be
performed simultanously. The crux
of this Prologue is the confrontation
between the putative Composer of
