editorial
As more observant readers of the
front page will notice, Felix
narrowly avoided a libel action in
issue 940. Although our behaviour
in printing an untrue allegation
about a member of the board of
Governors is reprehensible, the
reaction of Senior members of the
College raised some questions in
my mind.
During the course of my
somewhat justifiable 'ticking off,
I was told several things. Firstly, I
should discourage any negative
information about people 'who
generously give up there time and
energies to help the College'. While
I accept that printing lies is wrong,
I cannot, under any circumstances,
withhold criticism from those who
deserve it, whoever they may be.
Members of Governing Body are
among the most experienced and
professional people in the country.
Does this make them above
criticism? I think not, even if it is
only the editor of a student
newspaper who passes this
judgement.
The other implication from this
affair is that Student Newspapers
are in some way 'out to get' people
in authority. How can this be true?
What purpose does it serve to
antagonize individuals simply for
the job they do? It is even more
presumptuous to accuse all those
people across the United Kingdom
who produce Student Newspapers
of such bigotry. Is it possible that
a special breed of humans exist to
upset Senior Management? If so
who are they? Should they be
rooted out and destroyed? How do
they breed? And more importantly
what motivates this strange group?
' Clearly such a creation is a product
of an imagination so paranoid that,
the only reason they find to get out
of bed, is because the duvet is
plotting against them.
Most worryingly, a member of
the Felix office told me that
Governments grant freedom of
speech' and thus we should not
abuse those in authority too much.
Freedom of Speech is an essential
human right enshrined in an United
Nations declaration and the
American constitution. If those who
presume to run any organisation, be
it a country or a university, try and
control that expression, they are at
fault, not the media.
At the risk of accusations of
negativity' I have another
complaint. This week I became
involved in a futile and childish
argument with a Union Office
Sabbatical. After having apologised
for my behaviour, a rumour
reached me that this sabbatical had
threatened to get me thrown out of
Halls because I share a room with
my girlfriend and I should not 'piss
off important people' because I
could get into trouble. Not exactly
a crime of the greatest proportions,
but certainly worth frowning on.
What I object to, is the double
standards of someone who knows
something is happening but, only
mentions iffor personal gain. So,
here I am, I have confessed, my
guilt is plain for all to see. But, at
least I do not have to worry about
intemperate threats, from those who
presume themselves to be in
authority.
Deadline for
contributions to the
Freshers' Issue is
Monday 28th
September.
Who's Popped off with my Wednesday
We have noted, with mounting
unease, the widespread increase in
certain time anomalies over recent
weeks. I will try to be as gentle as
possible as I do not wish to cause
undue alarm, but bizarre
occurrences around the office are
resulting in paranoia and mass
hysteria, frenzied itching and hair
behavioural problems. I would also
like to apologise for the panicky and
unreasoned passage l a m writing,
but I'm frightened, and must leave
a document behind in case no-one
A Time Lord: keeping stum or killing time?
here gets out alive.
It began quietly enough; a hot
balmy day in the youth of August,
a Thursday, if I recall, was passing
normally, even, I daresay, joyfully,
until one of the handbook editors
and a man of most excellent
judgement, declared that the day
was, in fact, Wednesday. We, of
course, paid close attention to his
assertion, with one eye wryly cast
over his 72-hour wakened state,
before informing him that the day
in which we were habiting was
known to one and all as Thursday.
This was vociferously challenged
by said handbook editor, who
eventually conceded that the weight
of numbers were against him, but
swore vengeance on some cruel and
sneaky pup for having it away with
his Wednesday while his back was
turned. It was cause for some mirth,
I can tell you, because days don't
get stolen, do they...?
Then it happened to me. A mere
week later, I became aware of a
misplaced Wednesday of my own.
The Lard Clock remained resolute
and lumpy, and would not yield the
truth. I searched and searched, but
couldn't find it anywhere. I
remembered, with a pang of dread,
the recent loss of that other
Wednesday, and sought advice
from the aforementioned
dispossessed individual. Alas, his
heart lay in twain, broken by the
loss of a very personal and private
day. Even the Metropolitan Police,
stalwart chaps though they are,
were unable to help. To this day,
the disappearance remains a
mystery.
For a few weeks, time passed
quietly and remained in its proper
place; we thought we were safe.
Then, suddenly and without
warning, while the office was busy
collating the handbook last week,
not just a Wednesday, but a
Thursday also, snatched from
existence, and from under my very
nose. Probably while I was putting
a slab of delicious squashy brie onto
a hunk of french stick, with maybe
a slice of cervelat, a tomato or two,
perhaps some freshly ground black
pepper, or maybe when I had that
Twix, or was sitting on the toilet,
some wolfish chronavore happened
across a substantial chunk of my
week, thought 'Ah! I could do with
some of this!' and vanished before
you could say 'Oh no and fucking
red hot apfelstrudels, some wolfish
chronavore has nicked a substantial
chunk of my week!'. Since then, it
has spread like a nasty contagion,
bringing people out in festering
sores and very noses. I cut myself
shaving this morning, too.
We know little of our vampiric
assailant; perhaps it is acutely
sensitive to peak handbook activity,
perhaps we'll never know. I'i: 'save
you with a warning. Watch >o.r
days carefully...
