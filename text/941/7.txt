Imperial's Global Environment
Research Centre (GERC) is hosting
a symposium which intends to
examine the implications of the Rio
Earth Summit.
The two-day symposium, which
will be held in October, aims to
concentrate on Agenda 21, the
major agreement on environment
and development. Emphasis will
also be placed on the implications
for energy policy and pollution
control.
The symposium will be addressed
by senior figures from
environmental groups such as
Greenpeace; The Department of the

as ICI.

College is playing a leading role

Rodney Eastwood has been
promoted to the post of Deputy
Managing Director.
Mr Eastwood, formerly Director
of Planning, is now responsible for

Library stops
periodical loans as
merger continues
Due to financial pressures and the
amalgamation of the Lyon Playfair
and Science Museum libraries,
from October students will no
longer be able to borrow any
periodicals from Imperial College
central libraries
This decision brings the new joint
Imperial College and Science
Museum libraries into line with
most other large academic libraries,
where periodicals are usually
reference only. Previously.
Imperial College usually had more
than one copy of important
periodicals on campus. Increasing
periodical costs mean that in order
to maintain a large range of titles
only one copy of each could be
afforded. Central Libraries have
claimed in a recent press release.
In order to cope with the
decreased availability of
periodicals, the Library aims to
increase the number of
photocopying machines available
and relocating them throughout the
building.
The Union Bar will be open and
ready for business next Saturday
26th September, after the
refurbishment has been completed.

a 'bury your head in the sand
policy' on this issue.
