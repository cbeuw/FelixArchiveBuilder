COMMENT
FELIX
T
his May, Londoners will
again be called upon to
elect a mayor, and if the
polls are anything to go by
the race between incum-
bent Boris Johnson and returning rival
Ken Livingstone is too close to call.
The thing is, I have real difficulty un-
derstanding how that can be so. Cynics
remark that British politics is increas-
ingly being reduced to a personality
contest and, worryingly, it seems to me
that the 2012 mayoral election has a
candidate basing their entire campaign
on a persona.
Because, simply put, if we look over
these four years of Johnson we see that
even his claimed successes, such as the
council tax freeze and the “New Bus
For London”, don’t hold up to close
scrutiny.
Seeing as it is now plastered around
the city as part of Boris’s “9 point plan
for a Greater London”, the freeze of
council tax bills in the “Mayor’s Pre-
cept” portion of London is the perfect
example. The Back Boris campaign
proudly claim that this freeze saved
families £445, and while it’s true that
the precept did rise under Livingstone,
this figure is entirely imaginary. Rather
being derived from promised bud-
gets, this figure comes from projected
increases based on the average pre-
cept rise under Livingstone. Not only
that, this ignores the fact that Boris’s
freeze was funded substantially by a
central government grant, for which
Ken would also have been eligible.
Of course, Johnson has also gone one
step further, pledging to cut the precept
if he’s re-elected. The slight issue is
Back Boris? Not bloody likely!
that his cuts only amount to a generous
average saving of £7 a year per house-
hold.
Of course, as students, council tax
changes aren’t entirely our concern.
Transport however, the area where the
mayor has the most direct control, most
certainly is, and the record here is simi-
larly patchy. Under Boris ticket prices
have soared, seeing the cost of a single
bus journey rise by 50% to £1.35, and a
weekly zone 1-2 travelcard by 20% to
£29.20. But while Boris is happy to try
and claim network investment begun
under Livingstone for himself, it seems
a fair portion of this money is propping
up pet projects with spiralling costs.
While fares make a dent in our pock-
ets, TfL has spent £11m developing
just 8 of the “New Buses For London”,
which is a stark contrast to the £300k
it costs to purchase an existing hy-
brid model. The Barclay’s Cycle Hire
scheme, originally meant to be deliv-
ered at no cost to the tax payer, now has
80% of its current £140m bill footed
by TfL and the London Boroughs. In
a strikingly similar story, the planned
Thames Cable Car, also promised to be
delivered through private investment,
now has nearly half its £60m bill being
met by TfL, with no clear indication of
how its predicted £3m annual running
costs will be met.
Of course, it’s also possible that fare
increases have come about as a way to
replenish revenue lost from scrapping
the Congestion Charge Western Exten-
sion. And while Boris is making some
effort to recoup the economic effects of
its abolition, the same cannot be said
for the environmental impacts.
Up to 4,000 deaths a year in the capi-
tal can be attributed to air pollution, and
London is looking at swingeing fines of
£300m from both the EU and the In-
ternational Olympic Committee. But
Boris has seemingly refused to treat
the issue seriously, at one point trying
to claim high levels of particulates in
Central London were due to pollution
being carried over form the continent.
Any money he has committed to the
issue has been spent predominately
on Dust Suppressants, which a TfL
study states “will not be a useful [...]
technique for preventing exceedances
of the PM10 EU limit value”, and pot
plants, rather than actually addressing
the causes of pollution.
All of these points above fit in to a
wider image of an entirely disconnect-
ed City Hall. A place where Tory Lon-
don Assembly members believe “rela-
tively few Londoners use […] transport
in any way”. Where the number of
staff paid over £100k has doubled, the
mayor receives a larger salary than the
Prime Minister and marketing advisers
are paid through private companies to
evade tax. It’s a City Hall accused of
“barefaced lying” about Police cuts,
and that boasts of cutting waste while
maxing out public borrowing.
Of course, who you vote for on May
3rd remains entirely your choice. How-
ever, I implore you to reflect carefully
on the following question when mak-
ing your decision: What precedent does
it set for our Democracy if we allow a
man to drift towards a second term sim-
ply because he’s ‘funny’?
...the 2012
mayoral election
has a candidate
basing their entire
campaign on a
persona.

O
n the Wednesday before
elections opened, mem-
bers of the Union had
their questions answered
live on STOIC by candi-
dates for the ICU Sabbatical Positions,
as well as the faculty union presidents
and the student trustees. This is a fan-
tastic idea – if the candidates want our
vote, they should be prepared to answer
our questions and be subject to our
scrutiny.
If only that’s how it worked. The pro-
gramme itself was excellent, very well
put together with some brilliant com-
mentary by the people in the ‘Felix Stu-
dio’. However, the format of the pro-
gramme could do with improvement, as
it came across as simply a platform for
the candidates to say ‘Hi’ – not that this
is bad, in fact, it’s important that we all
get to know them.
As it so happened, one of my ques-
tions came up for the Felix Editor can-
didates. To my disappointment, in a
question where I asked for details on
how the potential editors would change
the journalistic output of Felix, the
three of them proceeded to answer the
complete opposite: how they would im-
prove the satirical output. Needless to
say, I was annoyed, and so proceeded
to question them on Twitter (and then
challenge them on their replies).
Candidates need to be scrutinised
on their policies: they can promise no
end of wonderful things, but if people
don’t actually challenge them to see if
the policies are realistic, or that they
have been properly thought through,
then there is a risk that a bad candidate
is elected. Who isn’t won over by tales
of wonder and awe (and free sweets)?
Whilst this allows the electoral body
to challenge the candidates – grilling
them as they deserve, there are other
benefits also: candidates can fight
amongst themselves. Whilst this could
lead to petty fighting and generally dis-
gusting tactics, we can hope that Im-
perial students are above this, and can
engage in an open and honest debate.
This not only teaches us more about the
candidates’ policies (and how practi-
cal they are), but also gives us a honest
idea as to what the candidate is like as a
person, away from the superficial image
given off by campaigning.
We saw this in 2010 with the Gen-
eral Election – the three party leaders
were put head to head in a (strangely
entertaining) debate. It may not have
changed many people’s vote (bar a
somewhat temporary boost in sup-
port for the Liberal Democrats), but it
gave the public a chance to make their
mark. The only thing I would change
is to allow the audience to fight back
at the candidates – make them prove
themselves to the electorate. Just less “I
agree with Nick”!
I have support in this, @Esoteric-
Gamer and @ICUChris both called for
a proper debate – this should send a
message. It may be too late for this year,
but that does not mean that next year’s
candidates can’t be subject to the inter-
rogation they deserve. Let us scrutinise
them in public for everyone to see, and
in return ICU gets the best set of sab-
batical officers that they could possibly
have. In the meantime, back to Twitter.
Reminder: If you’re reading this on Fri-
day, and you have not yet voted – re-
member to have your say! Voting closes
