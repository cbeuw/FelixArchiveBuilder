Voting in the Union’s “Big Elec-
tions” opened on Monday. As well as
the sabbatical, Student Trustee and
Faculty Union Executive positions
students can also use the Union’s on-
line system to vote for members of
their Departmental Society commit-
tee. 186 votes were cast in the first
five minutes of voting, with well over
80,000 votes having been cast by
over 5,200 voters at the time of going
to print. This represents a turnout of
49% of the Undergraduate population
and 13% of the Postgraduates, just
over 30% of all Imperial students.
This is already far above the average
national turnout in UK university stu-
dent elections, 16%. Imperial Union
hopes to have achieved the largest
turnout in the nation by the end of
voting, with at least 55% of Under-
graduates and 20% of Postgraduates
having voted.
Voting, however, has not been
trouble free, with technical problems
affecting the voting system early on
Monday morning. Amongst those af-
fected has been Jack Hewitt, candi-
date for Deputy President (Welfare),
whose manifesto was not initially
displayed on the in-line manifesto
view on the website, potentially
leading voters to believe that he had
not submitted it. The manifesto was
viewable upon direct clicking on the
candidate’s name. Hewitt maintains
that his manifesto “met the word limit
and was submitted on-time” and says
that the error gives “the people [he is]
running against an unfair advantage”.
