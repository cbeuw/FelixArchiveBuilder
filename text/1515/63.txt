Tenpin Bowling
IC Tenpin Bowling Team
First ever Imperial all-
ladies bowling team
tingham. The team did the school proud
by clinching the silver medal in the
Girl’s Team Event (Josephine Chiu, Xin
Yan Goh & Hui Erh Tay) and a bronze
medal in the Girl’s All Event (by Hui
Erh Tay, with an average of 193). In
addition, Christopher Chan will also
be representing BUCS for international
competitions. This is the first time in
history that we not only managed to
form a girls team, but also emerged vic-
torious. Indeed a moment to proud of!
Apart from being competitive, Impe-
rial Tenpin Bowling also offers casual
bowling every Wednesday for those
who wish to pick up some new skills or

Mary’s were giving it everything. Such
were defensive efforts required; even
James Hayward and George Lane were
seen to experience some hard forward
graft. In the final play of the game St
Mary’s were awarded a soft penalty try
as a consolation. The final score was
12-10. This capped a great season for
Imperial Rugby 1st XV winning their
league with a game to spare. They will
be tested next year in South Premier
B! This performance sets up an excit-
ing fixture next week against Imperial
Medicals at Varsity, please come down
and support your team!
