This season has been a mixed one for the ICSM
FC 1st team. We’ve suffered an unprecedented
amount of injuries to key players and as a result
we’ve failed to put out consistent XIs all season.
This has meant building an understanding between
team members has been more difficult than usual
but the players have still performed with admirable
spirit and passion throughout the season.
Varsity is a one-off game and we can use that to
our advantage. Setbacks during the season can all
be forgotten with a win in this fixture. Our penalty
shoot-out loss last year is still fresh in the memory
so we’re determined to settle the score in 2012.

We have started the season being the winners of
a dramatic cup final last year and having lost the
league title by a point. Our aims for this year were
to literally win every title we were competing in: ULU
Cup, ULU league and BUCS league. Unfortunately,
we did not have the necessary depth in the squad to
achieve this, so we ended up being in an average po-
sition in ULU league. We are chasing the league title
(and consequently the promotion) in BUCS and are
currently 3 points behind the top team; with 2 games
to go (including a table-top clash vs Westminster) we
have plenty of chances of finishing first.
Moreover, we managed to make it to the final of
ULU Cup for the third year in a row.
ICFC is definitely a club to be proud of being part
and all 7 teams are truly a big family.
Overall, we are 3 wins away of winning an dreamy
double and becoming one of the most successful
Imperial teams ever.

The 2011/2012 season has been
somewhat of a transitional year for IC
2nd Football Team. Results have been
mixed as personnel and tactics have had
to be adapted at many points throughout
the year to cover for injuries and player
movement between squads. At the start
of the season the ambition was to strive
for promotion in both our BUCS and ULU
leagues, and although this has not quite
come to fruition, things could have been
very different if a few results had gone
slightly differently along the way.
However, the season can still be seen
as a relative success. The vast major-
ity of the squad will still be available for
selection next year, and with a few addi-
tions, we should be set up nicely to have
success in all competitions.
The highlights from this year have in-
cluded victories over both the Medic 1st
and 2nd teams, and hopefully this run
will be continued at Varsity!

The 4s have had a very successful season with
11 wins and counting leaving us second in the
league with 3 games remaining. Despite this, a
poor set of results in the middle of the season
means it will be difficult for us to win what would
be a third consecutive league title. This season
has still seen some fantastic performances and
the 7-0 destruction of LSE 5s, will be long re-
membered. Freshers Taha Butt, Jack Peacock
and Myles Jarvis have been stand out perform-
ers all season. (The lack of culture/ intellectual
presence in Reynolds had left Myles disgruntled
at his former club). After disappointing perfor-
mances in various cups the 4s will be looking to
achieve a taste of success in Varsity.

Expectations at the beginning of the season
were muted, with the departure of big names and
even bigger characters at the back end of last
season. Two wins from our opening 2 games away
at UCL hinted at a promising season. First term
also saw us recover from a terrible start in BUCS
to win 3 games on the trot taking us to the top of
the table. A major highlight was beating our own
2s and also our demolishming of St. Mary’s in the
BUCS cup. As the season comes to a close, with
two games to go we are still in the mix for pro-
motion in both of our leagues, quite an astonish-
ing feat. And with 2 wins and 2 losses out of 4
against Medic opposition this season, Varsity is
a perfect curtain closer.

This will be the second year that the 3rd teams of
each football club have met each other under the
pretence of Varsity - Last years inaugural match was
deservedly won in a hard fought game that the med-
ics clinched in the dying minutes. It was a game
enjoyed by not only the team but also the tens of
fans on the sideline cheering their support which
will hopefully be repeated this year!
ICSMFC 3s have had a highly successful season
thus far. Having already reached the UH Cup Final
to be played on Wed 14th March we will hopefully
be bringing the team its first piece of silverware for
many years. One week later we will hopefully be
repeating last years accolades and succeeding in
conquering our IC rivals.

The 4th team have had an incredible season
this year, with a great intake of new freshers
to bolster the side. The chat has been beyond
belief and so has the playing on the pitch. With
a goal tally of unbelievable belief, for the 4s,
we have had some great results, but with the
first varsity we hope to extend our streak. IC 4s
won’t know what hit them.
