We’ve had an excellent season this year and
are on track to finish in the top two of our BUCS
league. Tamar and Poppy’s consistent shoot-
ing and strong defence from every member of
the team have contributed hugely to this year’s
success. We have only played the medics once
this year, in our very first match where we nar-
rowly lost 42-39. Varsity promises to be a closely
fought battle and a win for IC 1sts would be the
icing on the cake!

The season got off to a rocky start, with the
team consisting of 8 new members. We quickly
got into the swing of things –o ur performance
in the ULU league was not to be outdone and
we have secured a position in the top half of
the table with 3 games in hand. The girls also
played fantastically in a very difficult BUCS
league with some exceptionally strong teams
and have managed to finish mid-table. We are
very pleased with our performance this season
considering that we have been plagued with in-
juries and have often had difficulties fielding a
whole team. The 2’s last league game of the
season is against ICSM 3’s on the 19th March
(Just 2 days before Varsity!) We are hoping to
use this game as a warm up that will boost mo-
rale within the team. The match is being played
at Ethos at 8pm and we would be grateful for
all the support we can get. The team is the
most determined I have ever seen them and
this year varsity is OURS!

IC Netball 3s have had strong season so far. We are on target to finish within the top two of the
ULU league and have a good chance of being promoted. We also reached the semi-finals of the ULU
reserve cup putting up a good fight to the eventual winners. We have a very strong team and the
match is bound to be close but I’m confident we will win on the day, especially after last year’s amaz-
ing victory!

This year the 4th team has had a lot of new play-
ers and it’s been really fantastic to see everyone’s
improvement over the season! While we didn’t do
so well in the league, we got to the quarter finals
of the Cup and now we have really gelled as a
team. Every girl has been so dedicated to training
sessions with the shooters regularly staying on
afterwards to practice their technique. If we play
to the standard we have been I am confident this
can be reflected in a win against the medics!

The 5th team is new to IC this year and they

able defense promise to give the medics a run
for their money.against the medics!

At the end of last season, the 2nds lost sev-
eral players. We started this season with sev-
eral freshers and so took a few games to settle
down and get to know each other. We started
our BUCS season well with wins over Reading
and Brighton. Unfortunately, our next few BUCS
games coincided with 4th year exams and RAG
week so we were missing a lot of players, and
didn’t do so well. We hope to finish the BUCS
season the same way we started it, with a
couple of wins. In ULU, we have had a difficult
season. We started with a win, but after some
close matches and matches against really dif-
ficult teams we couldn’t keep it up. This season
I feel that we have really improved throughout
the season as we’ve got used to playing with
each other, so I am confident that we will come
back really strong next season.

ICSM Netball 1s began the 2011-12 season on
a high. We were ULU Premiership Champions, had
returned from Sheffield with the BUCS Cup and had
only just missed out on BUCS promotion, coming
second on goal difference.
The squad remained strong, only losing one final
year and gaining a talented, versatile fresher who
slotted straight into the team. We easily command-
ed a hold upon the ULU league once again, keep-
ing the title for a second year. However, the BUCS
league was our main focus for this season. Tied on
points with one game remaining, we have our fingers
crossed for promotion.
We’re looking forward to another closely contest-
ed Varsity, but remain confident after a consistent
season that we can come away on top for another
successive year!

The team has had a total revamp since last year and during the year we have improved massively.
We have had a tough season with our BUCs fixtures, but have proved that we are not a team that
easily gives up by having various last half comebacks keeping our opposition on edge. Our team work
and aggressiveness is really starting to shine through, helping us to achieve some great wins in our
ULU matches.
We are looking forward to giving varsity a final push to hopefully end the season on a high.

After a busy season full of ups and downs,
the icsm fifths are hoping to finish on a high.
Following a narrow draw to a team that we
previously lost to, things are looking good for
varsity! I have absolutely loved being the cap-
tain of such a fantastic team who have worked
incredibly hard all year, and i can only hope
that their efforts pay off in the most impor-
tant game of the season in a win against the
medics!

In BUCS we are top of our division, last wednes-
day we had our last BUCS match against Kingston
3s who were tied with us on the league table. It
was a close match but in the end we won 31-26 - a
well deserved victory as everyone stepped up thier
game. In ULU we still have 3 games left to play. In
our ULU league we have done well so far and won
most of our matches but have had some unfortu-
nate narrow loses by 2 or 3 goals to Kings and QM.
We unfortunately narrowly lost to RUMS 3s 30 - 27
last Monday.
