autumn/winter 2012
bring you the best bits from last month’s catwalks
does best, with Karlie Kloss
taking a starring role as the
quintessential Lanvin woman
in a sweetly structured black
velvet dress. Flirty in its flare,
but toughened up with a
double wrapped leather belt,
no doubt this will become
next season’s most coveted
LBD. After a dark interlude,
it seemed the treasure chest
opened, filled with golden bul-
lions and gems the size of
marbles. The girls glittered in
Alber’s crystal-embellished,
gold-plated eveningwear, fol-
lowed by his unique take on
the patterned dress – floral
prints leaking delicately down
This season at Lanvin certain-
ly had cause for celebration:
Alber Elbaz’s brought in his
10th year at the helm of fash-
ion’s longest surviving house
with thundering applause
and bellowing cheers. From
peacock green to glowing or-
ange, and cut in Alber’s sig-
nature structure of strength
in simplicity, the models took
to the runway with a confi-
dence that only Lanvin can in-
stall. Dramatic elegance with
a dash of fun is what Alber
the garments, leaving art-
ful trails behind. Of course,
no glamorous occasion is
complete without diamonds
and fur and Alber Elbaz isn’t
one to hold back; each outfit
came with heavy dash of ei-
ther, or in most cases, an irre-
sistible combination of both.
If a statement needs to be
made this season, one need
look no further than Lanvin.
In the true style of Parisian
theatre, the show ended with
Alber himself taking to the
mic with a triumphant rendi-
tion of Que Sera Sera, and in
this case we couldn’t agree
more. - AY

of models came clad in tight
brocade dresses or loosely
cut trousers. Stomping the
Milanese catwalk in knee-high
pointed boots and sweeping
capes, the models conjured
a sense of adventure through
a dark enchanted forest. Yet
this season, the element of
forestry originated from the
garments themselves, with
appliqué flowers on translu-
cent chiffon blouses, and flo-
ral prints swirling on billowing
silk. A floor-length emerald de-
voré dress paired with sweetly
twisted-back hair painted a
portrait of elvish royalty - in
fact, the collection as whole
A romantic decadence under-
pinned Frida Giannini’s show
for Gucci this season – a story
of power and luxury painted in
black. But it was in the shades
of blacks that Giannini weaved
her magic: from leathers to
velvets, jewels and furs, the
elaborate mix of textures and
fabrics used in each outfit
gave an unexpected grandeur
to the single toned colour.
With a deep atmospheric beat
that faded into a clinking musi-
cal chime, Gucci’s first parade
emulated a sense of mystical
aristocracy, but the women
donning Gucci’s robes were
the heroines of their fairytales,
not the damsels in distress.
But that didn’t stop them from
disrobing into the sheerest of
dresses, lighter than air. Rath-
er, it seemed that the jewelled
flowers entwining themselves
around the models were a deli-
cate work of nature, and that
the layers of tulle flowing to
the floor were but a dramatic
addition. This may not have
been a collection to battle the
cold, but given the choice we’d
choose Gucci’s dark fairytale
adventure any day. - AY

darkened days, the first mod-
els stalked out in husky greys,
mossy greens and the deep-
est browns. Like sharp-clawed
owls swooping down upon
their prey, Ackermann’s use of
leather came in sharp distinc-
tive layers, harrowing down to
the knee in dagger-like points.
But as the sun began to rise,
the colours of dawn gradually
began to leak in. The dark
plums that formed elongated
trousers morphed into brassy
copper jackets and glowing
red coats. When day broke,
so did the streaks of blue.
But alas, it was a short day
typical of the gloomy days of
Inspired by the autumn leaves
outside his house in Antwerp,
Haider Ackermann’s show this
season was one of romance
and nostalgia. Referring to
nature as opposed to the cy-
beristic future he has so of-
ten insinuated, it was a sen-
sual and sinuous collection
that Ackermann presented to
the bellowing croon of Frank
Sinatra’s Autumn Leaves.
Opening before dusk on such
winter, and soon the deep
amethyst of night returned
in dresses tightly clinched
forming shimmering folds,
whilst others slipped on in
the matt hues reflected by
the clouds. The juxtaposition
of delicately beautiful fabrics
and the powerful constricted
waists with sharply flared hips
forged an enchanting partner-
ship, the love story between
Ackermann’s erotic tones and
commanding sense of archi-
tecture, sewn together im-
peccably by his unparalleled
sense of draping. This was,
undoubtedly, the season’s
most alluring love story. - AY
