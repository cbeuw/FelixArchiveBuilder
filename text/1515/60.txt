SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots.
The numbers in each square
indicate how many edges of the
square are part of the loop, so
if it contains a “2”, you know
that two and only two out of
four edges have lines. That’s all
the info you need to get the one
logical answer (though waiting
a week to see the solution will
also do). Answers to puzzles.
felix@imperial.ac.uk, as the
puzzles team recieves one eas-
ter egg per correct solution.

Word Wheel
Make as many words of at least
4 letters as you can, always using the
central one. NO plurals, conjugated
verbs, comparatives or superlatives,
because I said so.. There is always at
least one 9 letter word.
TARGET: 20
