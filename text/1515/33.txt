IC Captain: Sam Alton
Having been promoted into the highest BUCS
league for the south east this year, we’ve had a
tough season against teams such as Portsmouth
and Reading. It has been a challenge for all the
team, but credit to the freshers for stepping up
and bonding well with the team. The experience
has been demanding, but the rewards will be
observed when we bring the same standard of
hockey to the medics. In particular, the experi-
ence of our final year students, Lionel ‘Dr Ritchie’
Sumner and Ewan ‘Yogi’ Quince will be vital when
it comes to scoring, having proven to be a danger-
ous pair throughout the year.
Our preparation for Varsity has improved sig-
nificantly in the past weeks with our best perfor-
mances being displayed in our latest Wednesday
matches with a growing confidence emerging.
There is a great desire to maintain our unbeaten
record at Varsity and show the medics who’s re-
ally in charge!

The team have had mixed results in the BUCS
league 2, coming up against much stronger opposi-
tion that last season, and struggled for points with
disappointing results early on. The first team is cur-
rently placed fourth in the table. The medics play in
the Premier League of University of London Hockey,
and have finished the competition in second place
behind UCL. This year also saw the team reach the
quarter finals of the BUCS Cup completion for the
South East of the country.
There is a good breadth of players, with both
freshers and several players that will be represent-
ing the school for their sixth and final time at Var-
sity.
Despite a tough start to the season, the medics
have currently found some good form winning seven
of their last ten games. Last year’s varsity match
was close fought, with 5-4 game going to IC. The
medics came out on top at the only match played
this year – there is no doubt that this year’s varsity
will be a close match well worth watching!

After a shaky start to the season we found
ourselves our new coach Justin who has since
done wonders for the 1st XI. The makeup of
the team has changed considerably since last
season, and with justin’s fantastic coaching we
have had some incredible wins. After Christ-
mas we were joint top of the league with Kings,
but an unfortunate loss against them a couple
of weeks ago means that we will most likely
finish second in the league. This season has
built the foundations of a strong team for the
next couple of years, and we look forward to a
fantastic varsity game...
The Ladies 1’st team has had a very success-
ful 11/12 season. We have been known many
times to turn up with the bare 11 players, but
the girls have shown great commitment and
competitiveness and have had a magnificent
time so far. This season has seen the team play
some of their best, expansive hockey and we
have gained promotion in our BUCS league, to
1A, with one game in hand; as well as winning
the ULU premier league. These are massive
achievements for the team, made even harder
by great runs in both the ULU and BUCS cups,
resulting in reaching the final of both. With the
help and dedication of our coach Oli Bell, the
team has trained hard and as a result has only
lost one match so far this season, but with two
finals and a potential rearranged varsity match
ahead the hardest are yet to come. We have
had a very busy season, but the girls are defi-
nitely up for capping off the season in style with
a win over the medics at varsity.

IC Captain: Kathryn Leonard
With regards to BUCS overall results, the team
has played 9 matches to date, with 3 wins, 1 draw
and 5 losses (the greatest of which was 15-0). Cap-
tained by the resilient Kathryn Leonard, the team
has seen the intake of a number of new players and
the strong development in team spirit, technique
and undeniable skill. Top goal scorers for the team
are Ellie and Fiona, with midfield extraordinaires Hil-
ary, Sorcha and Caroline providing great support.
Injuries have been frequent and significant; de-
spite this, defence has held strong. It has been
great to be a part of such a high spirited team; we
intend to break our current streak by securing a
great win at Varsity against ICSM 2’s.

We have had a fantastic season both on and off
the pitch this year, finishing a competitive 4th in
our BUCS league and celebrating our wins (and oc-
casional losses) in style at Sports Night. With some
fantastic newcomers and much loved regular play-
ers there’s been some great hockey and even bet-
ter team spirit, and we are all looking forward to the
challenge of Varsity! After the past three Varsities
resulting in a draw, it’ll be an exciting and demand-
ing game for both sides, and hopefully a fun day
all round!

It’s been an up and down season for ICHC M3
this season. A disastrous start to the year re-
sulted in a Christmas at the bottom of bucs. This
term, some big improvements in both play and
passion led the team to second in ulu, the ulu re-
serve cup final, which is to be played before var-
sity yet the day after the ICHC annual dinner (not
good), but with a relegation decider still to come
in bucs. Having played our first varsity last year,
the men’s 3s are looking to continue their 100%
record and start Varsity with a bang for ICHC.
