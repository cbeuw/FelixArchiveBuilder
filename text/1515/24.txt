Don’t vote… yet
Y
ou heard me. Despite
being torn three or more
ways between candi-
dates telling you to vote
for them, hold back un-
til you’ve heard what I have to say (as-
suming you have a voice in your head
when reading this), or even complete-
ly. This article is no more than twelve
hours from being too late for this year,
but should serve well for next year’s
elections and beyond.
Democracy is the best of a truly aw-
ful set of government options: for it
to work properly you need a populace
that’s not only impartial and properly
informed, but intelligent and humble
enough to know when their opinion is
completely unwarranted. Yeah, every-
one has the right to their opinion, blah
blah blah. Claiming otherwise would
paint you as some demon advocate
against free speech. I couldn’t care less
about everyone having their own opin-
ion on a topic, but for two things: not
all of them are sufficiently informed
and not everyone is capable of dis-
missing ignorance or propaganda. Ei-
ther problem by itself would be solved
by the absence of the other; and solv-
ing the latter is a hell of a lot harder, so
here’s what you do.
If you don’t have any good reason
to vote, don’t. If you can’t handle tell-
ing your friends that you didn’t vote
then just lie about it, praying nobody
hacks the elections to de-anonymise
the whole thing. “But it’s your right
to vote! All the people who died in
the struggle to have your voice heard
would be disgraced! If everyone
stopped voting, we‘d have another
Hitler in power!” Sure, prove God-
win’s Law yet again. And sure, all of
us here have a right to vote. A duty,
some might even say. This is where
people are wrong. Your duty is to
make a vote that matters – one that is
based on a critical review of each of
the candidates. So in fact, your real
responsibility is to put your brain into
gear during elections to think properly
about how to spend your vote, rather
than blindly choosing someone be-
cause they hounded you the most over
Twitter or Facebook. At best, your vote
is completely random, hence inconse-
quential. At worst, you’re favouring a
candidate for the wrong reasons at the
expense of someone better.
I will confess that the “properly in-
formed” pre-requisite is quite hard to
achieve: not only does a campaigning
length of two weeks hardly provide
sufficient information, but the candi-
dates themselves could be running for
a slew of unfavourable reasons that can
be hard to filter out. Not to mention that
if you’re slick enough with your pub-
lic relations you can completely hood-
wink enough people to win an election.
Impartiality is trivial in governmental
elections but called into question when
the chances are you might personally
know a few of the candidates. In my
experience, it’s the people who aren’t
particularly enthused by elections that
tend to say that they’re going vote for
the guy they know – if you’re one of
them, just remember that they don’t
know if you actually voted, and any
brownie points you gain are minimal
when you consider you are just one
among dozens of friends and poten-
tially thousands of voters. You might
argue that if one vote is insignificant,
then there’s no harm – which is true
until others start thinking the same.
In short, if you think elections are a
popularity contest, kindly step away
from the booth and into your nearest
autocratically governed student body.
The frenzy surrounding elections
is sure to dazzle and disorient you (I
know I feel like that), but before giving
in to the rainbow of posters, tweets,
Facebook updates, human pyramids,
flyers and free sweets to vote against
RON, take a step back and think about
whether you should even bother.

M
ost people define a
miracle as a super-
natural event, inex-
plicable by the laws
of science and na-
ture. So is it reasonable for a modern,
rational, Imperial scientist to believe
in miracles?
Last week I spent an afternoon wan-
dering around the Blackett lab, ask-
ing fellow Physics undergraduates for
their opinion on this. Many simply
hadn’t considered the question, and
freely admitted they didn’t have any
thoughts on the matter. Others refused
to answer, perhaps nervous of this
odd, religious second year interrupt-
ing their conversations. However, a
few had stronger opinions. One stu-
dent stated that miracles were impos-
sible, another that a belief in miracles
and a belief in physical laws are in-
compatible. Yet another explained
that his belief in miracles and his sci-
entific studies were two separate areas
that didn’t necessarily contradict one
another.
Let’s conduct a little thought exper-
iment. A first year medic bursts from
the SAF claiming that a supernatu-
ral event has taken place. A cadaver,
just about to be dissected, suddenly
opened its eyes, sat up and asked for
a glass of water. As a rational Impe-
rial scientist, you’re naturally scepti-
cal, and your friend sitting with you
looks incredulous. Your friend im-
mediately exclaims “That’s complete
balderdash!” and continues eating.
Can a scientist believe in miracles?
But you’re not so quick to dismiss
the claim. You question the medic a
little further: “Are you certain of what
you saw? Have you slept much lately?
Was anyone else present?” The story
still checks out, and you decide to go
and examine the evidence for your-
self. You enter the SAF and immedi-
ately see a group of medics laughing
uproariously. It turns out to have been
an elaborate RAG Week prank.
But who was the better scientist:
you or your friend? Despite the fact
that your friend was correct, how was
he so certain? I would like to suggest
that it is unscientific to dismiss mir-
acles without first investigating the
evidence, even if the claim is outra-
geous. Because we all study science
it can be easy to forget that scientific
laws are not infallible. They are sim-
ply expectations based on consistent
observation and experience.
Now, as a Christian I certainly be-
lieve in miracles. Christianity makes
no sense if miracles aren’t possible.
My entire faith hangs on the miracle
of Jesus Christ, having been dead
for three days, rising from the dead.
Of course, you’d initially think that
was impossible. So did all those who
claim to have seen Jesus alive after
his death. In the biographies of Je-
sus’s life, we read of how his own
friends took some convincing before
they really believed it was him, and
not a ghost or some trick of the mind.
Jesus talked to them, touched them,
and ate with them. Only then did they
begin to believe.
Interestingly, the Bible doesn’t seem
to make much distinction between
supernatural and everyday events. It
explains how in God “all things hold
together” – that is, matter would cease
to exist if God were to stop sustain-
ing it. From this perspective, our very
existence is the real miracle. Any so-
called ‘supernatural events’ might be
unusual, but are just as miraculous as
everything else.
There is one other, huge miracle
in the Bible. According to Jesus, the
most important things in life are to
love God with all your heart, soul,
strength and mind, and to love your
neighbour as you love yourself. I
can’t answer for everyone, but I know
that I, for one, have not met these cri-

teria. I’m a long, long way off. But by
his death and resurrection Jesus has
made it possible for me to have the
right relationship with God, despite
all my shortcomings. The miracle is
that anyone who has faith in this, no
matter who you are or what you’ve
done, can look forward to an eternity
in paradise.
Perhaps what you’ve read has been
intriguing, provoking or just plain
offensive! I’d love you to bring your
questions or objections to a series
of events investigating the resurrec-
tion of Jesus next week at Imperial.
