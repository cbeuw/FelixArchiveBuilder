BASKETBALL WATERPOLO
LACROSSE
Medics Captain: Brad Sanders IC Captain: Joe Gibbs
IC Waterpolo have had a fantastic season fol-
lowing last year’s ULU success. We have won 9
out of 9 ULU games and well placed to win back-
to-back titles. Varsity is a big game for us as we
often train with and compete against the medics
throughout the season. No-one can remember
the last time the medics won, and we hope to
keep it that way.
Varsity ambition:
Keep our unbeaten record this season and in
varsity history.

2012’s ULU water polo league results may prompt
some of you to think IC will dominate at varsity. They
are sitting at the top of the league table, undefeated
in weeks. They play their matches, they go to the
pub and they exchange (tall) stories of their dazzling
tactics.
But while they sit jauntily on puffy cushions in the
Hoop and Toy, the Medic Beast has been stirring.
We play our matches. Then instead of filling the
local with news off our brilliance, we go straight to
a late night gym and sculpt our abs. We work on our
swimming and throwing muscle groups so that the
next time we’re in the water, we are bigger, better
and stronger than our opposition.
And it works. UCL’s student paper last week de-
tailed their team’s suffering at the hands of ICSM
water polo in an article titled, “Medics Rise from
the Dead.”
Felix could soon be printing similar lines come
Varsity.

For us, the Varsity game against the Med-
ics will mark the end of a rather successful
season. I am confident that the team will
demonstrate its strength once more and
walk away with a clear win!
While not all our efforts were rewarded with
a win I am very proud of my team for always
remaining positive and for never resorting to
mean fouls or violence despite the fact that
some teams we encountered had a rather
brutal way of playing. We have been told on
several occasions by both losing and winning
opponents that they appreciate our fairness
and positive attitude.
The greatest success of the team is that
we made it to today’s BUCS Cup Final! We
are playing LSE 1st and need as many sup-
porters as possible!

Imperial Basketball Men’s 1st team have had
a very strong season so far. After being pro-
moted last year from BUCS league 3 they have
established themselves well in a new league,
currently tied top of BUCS league 2 with an
outstanding Win-Loss record of 7-2. The next
game vs. City University will decide which team
wins the league and gets promoted to a new
division. Imperial Basketball also progressed
to the finals of the ULU Challenge Cup, which
took place on Monday 13th March, but after a
hard fought match they ended up runner’s up.
Varsity will signal the end of a great season
with a great team and we will prove our worthi-
ness at the Varsity match at Ethos!
ICSM basketball is enjoying its most success-
ful season to date. We have equaled last year’s
win total in ULU despite being severely injury
depleted. We also defeated the IC 2nds in ULU
for the first time in club history. This is our first
season in BUCS, and we currently have two wins,
with two more matches to play. Our biggest win
of the season came in the 2nd round of the BUCS
cup, when after being down by 20 points at half-
time, we came back to beat St. Mary’s University
College by one point! With momentum on our
side, we’re looking to set another club milestone
by beating the IC 1sts at Varsity for the first time
ever.

Medics season summary:
2011-2012 has been a solid season for Imperial
Medics Lacrosse; still undefeated, placing top of
the league for another consecutive year, the ULU
cup final still to come and it seems like nothing can
stand in our way. We are absolutely pumped for
varsity which will be the final jewel in 2011-2012’s
crown.
IC season summary.
This season has been really fun, we’ve really en-
joyed our matches and thoroughly come to learn
that winning isn’t everything although a lot of time
we don’t bother to keep score. Super excited for var-
sity which should be a real HOOT! WOO, GO IC!
