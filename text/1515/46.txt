somed from shrunken, pleated
seed husks dotted with pearles-
cent florets of sequins into shiv-
ering cascades of organza, mas-
saged into discernible frothy
petals which somehow sus-
tained an extraordinary oxymo-
ronic combination of a downy,
feather-like texture and the
crimped shape of a pteriomor-
phic seashell. The inspiration? A
humble mushroom. And unglam-
orous as that might seem, visu-
ally, this woman is a futuristic
incarnation of a fairy princess, a
Sugar Plum Fairy in lilac dégra-
dée, and that future is certainly
bright. Even the evolution of the
princess, a story told through
Once again, the organic refer-
ences at McQueen were seared
with a modern intricacy, the
shoes heel-less and the mod-
els’ eyes hidden behind mir-
rored visors. It was curious to
watch the clothes move, each
shaggy twist of Mongolian lamb
fur, ostrich feather and goat fur
undulating and recoiling as if
dancing to the ebullient refrain
of The Beach Boys’ “Good Vi-
brations”. The silhouettes blos-
the length of the show, was not
one haunted by any dark, apoca-
lyptic coda that might hint at the
signature of Sarah Burton’s late
mentor. Instead, the movement
was from “innocence to experi-
ence,” as Tim Blanks elegantly
put it. Burton is pushing for-
ward, in technique and vision,
McQueen’s spirit becoming less
of a shadowy burden and more
of a guiding star, a surveying
eye casting his blessing over
her hand in keeping his house
alive. To quote a different genre
of legend, “I, I love the colour-
ful clothes she wears, and the
way the sunlight plays upon her
hair…” - SV

model demurely clasping her
blush pink coat closed; you
wondered what was hidden
beneath. Nothing, perhaps, or
maybe a satin sheath night-
dress? As the collection un-
folded, it became clear that
this was a woman whose
challenge it was to at once
both conceal and be seen, a
play-off between the proper
and the improper. Graphic
cut-outs, slices of silver and
moulded black leather cut
through a palette evoking the
break of dawn: pale grey, pink
and coffee brown. Protected
within serene confines, Raf Si-
mons captured a collection of
Raf Simons’ swansong at Jil
Sander could have seemed
planned to be just that, a col-
lection to end an era at the
fashion house. However, his
departure from the house
was confirmed a mere two
days before the show, and at
the finale, a tearful Simons
received both a standing ova-
tion and an encore. The show
opened to the tune of Mazzy
Star’s “Fade Into You” with a
intimate domestic moments
between a couple, from morn-
ing lingerie to sculpted black
cocktail dresses, and the vi-
sion was almost poetic in its
simplicity. Vanessa Friedman
of the FT called the collec-
tion “mesmerizing”. This, the
closing collection of Simons’
“couture trilogy”, was nothing
short of an ending most ap-
propriate to an extraordinary
seven-year reign at Jil Sander.
As successor to Raf Simons,
there is no doubt that even Jil
herself will need all the help
she can get sustaining the
critics’ ceaseless praise of
his work. - SV

violet, lime green, mustard or-
ange. And though some colours
should, objectively, have been
throwing insults at one another
upon forced combination, some-
how the mustard nestled com-
fortably within the chocolate
brown velvet, the kaleidoscopic
embellishment upon navy blue.
The silhouettes were certainly
nothing modern, but escaped
any inkling of seeming dated;
the fabrics from which they
were cut required the highest
level of technology to produce,
many costing up to €1,000 per
metre. Skirts fell to mid-calf,
layered beneath magnificent
frock-coats with wide enamelled
All change on the Louis Vuitton
Express – a steam engine pulls
into the Cour Carrée of the Pal-
ais du Louvre, and a procession
of romantic heroines from a by-
gone era (followed two paces
behind by a uniformed porter,
naturally) disembark to an audi-
ence held beguiled by a vision
of cinematic nostalgia. The
colour palette seemed to be
taken out of a sepia film reel:
on a base of brown, Marc threw
buttons, and sunken top hats
(something reminiscent of the
everyday garb of the Mad Hatter)
perched atop. Some of these
melancholy beauties were be-
spectacled; dark, saucer-sized
lenses twinkling beneath their
hat brims – evocative of the
lady wishing to travel incognito,
unaware that she’s wearing the
most conspicuous items of dis-
guise. This is not to mention the
luggage toted by her loyal por-
ter, equally luxurious in glittering
sequin or alligator, or fluttering
dégradée goat fur. A triumph of
Tolstoyan proportions, exposing
Marc Jacobs for the true show-
man that he is. -SV
