What’s better than one fulfilling existence?
TWO wordokus, you say? Well, in that case
you’re in for a treat!
Tell you what, in addition, every row, column
and 3x3 box must contain the letters in the grid
once and once only. Along one of the rows or

these phrases yield great advice to be applied to
almost any situation.
The headings above reflect the childishness of
the word or phrase. The more childish the word,
the more difficult the wordoku.

the side of the grid.
