Confusing tree maps, how
I do love thee. I bet not a
single one of you could with-
draw your pale faces from
the dim glow of your monitors
when you realised you could
watch your department’s
block slightly grow or shrink
based on which button you
click. SERIOUSLY WOW THE
BLOCKS CHANGE SIZE.
Seriously, didn’t everyone
stop caring about the turn-
out once we passed UCL?
Big whoop, we’re addicted to
our web browsers more than
them. It’s hardly an achieve-
ment to beat most other uni-
versities anyway – they have
people on Arts degrees, and
that lot still use Comic Sans
for everything.
This week you don’t care
about elections. Screw it,
no-one cares about elec-
tions. Why don’t all the can-
didates just get together and
have a big President three-
some, and their illegimate
love-child can be our new
leader, saving Imperial from
enthusiasm and responsible
drinking.
AMAZING NEWS JUST IN:
THEY’VE ADDED A NEW CIR-
CLE TO THE STATS PAGE.
They should have made it
tumbleweed instead – it would
have drawn more attention. At
least the circle is easily vis-
ible, who the hell came up
with having a light yellow bar
overlaid by a slightly darker
yellow bar?
Joy, now the Union homep-
age is constantly bugging
me that it’s time to vote. I’ve
already voted dammit, and
my AdBlock won’t get rid of
it. Oh look, they’ve given the
guy next to the link to the nor-
mal homepage a sad face.
That changes everything, the
apathetic voter will definitely
make the effort now.
RON is such a pretentious
tool, running for all the damn
positions. How did he even
manage to run in every Fac-
ulty Union? I say we all vote
for him for everything and
watch him slowly turn to a
life of alcoholism and drug
abuse, using Union finances
and blaming the losses on
the Summer Ball.
The leaflets suck this year. I
picked up what was meant to
be my annual stash of loo roll,
to find out they were all shiny
and just spread stuff where
that stuff is not supposed to
go. So I put them back on
campus and laugh to myself
as some ignorant voters read
them and ask their friends if
they can “smell that”.
There are people wearing
those stupid T-shirts support-
ing some idiot or another all
over the place. If they love
their candidate so much,
why don’t they just get down
on their knees and show their
appreciation...? Hallelujah.
Besides, they only have one
top each – don’t they ever
wash?
So I’ve just been informed
that RON isn’t a real person.
“It stands for re-open nomi-
nations” they tell me. Like
that’s going to do any good –
ooh I know, we’ll let the same
idiots run for the same posi-
tions over and over until all
but one of them collapse with
exhaustion from annoying
everyone during lunchtime.
The Post-grads have got the
right idea – ignore the elec-
tions entirely and get on with
their anti-social research. Or
maybe they just don’t vote be-
cause their computers have
been on the fish tank screen-
saver for so long as a reading
light for theses and to “relax”
them that they’ve forgotten it’s
an actual computer.
The freshers barely even
care! Where did it all go
wrong – why did the second
and third years start caring? It
doesn’t even matter; a bunch
of people take a year out of
lectures to go to meetings
and blog about stuff. Then
return to lectures a year later
and realise all their friends
have forgotten about them.
Deadened by routine, the old
Sabbaticals go back to blog-
ging, but this time it’s about
their “feelings” and how they
“miss being important”. Who
cares, RON is doing your job
now. And better. WIll you all
just go and vote now so that
we can win and everyone
shuts up about it? It’s doing
my head in.

Michael Hunt reports on how the Onions’ most successful elections ever failed to reach the ambitious goals set
The last week has seen
the Onion’s latest at-
tempt at reaching the
number one spot in
student union election
turnout. Last year’s first
place (based on the
percentage of voters to
electoral role) went to
Exeter University. With
a staggering 38.3%
turnout, Exeter was as-
sumed to be the obvi-
ous target to beat in
2012. However “big”
plans from Imperial Col-
lege Onion’s think tank
set the optimistic goal of
achieving a 120% turn-
out in this years Sab-
batical elections. While
some criticised such a
goal has “optimistic” or
“mathematically incor-
rect”, the Onion (with its
team of hardened mon-
keys) set about to do
the impossible. Howev-
er, the inevitable failure
of reaching such a tar-
get has come as no sur-
prise to some individu-
als, despite a plethora
of gimmicks and stunts
to boost figures.
Throughout the five
day voting period the
Onion went to extremes
to attain a respectable
(but not quite wanted)
figure, topping the elec-
tion league tables na-
tionally. The first and
most obvious ploy was
to bring back a live
stats page which, after
last year’s popularity,
proved to be a huge
success. Paraded by
the official mascots (The
Little Guys), this year’s
stats went to show that
the sheer arrogance of
Imperial students would
not let them be bested
by “lesser” universi-
ties. With an average
of 40,000 users on the
stats page at any one
time, Hangman fully
expects this tactic to
replicate itself for many
years to come.
However, in a particu-
larly controversial move,
the Faculty Union elec-
tions were merged into
the same period and
system as those used
for the Sabbatical elec-
tions. Due to the nature
of every student officer
position being elected
at the same time, stu-
dents were continually
spamed with emails,
flyers and lecture shout
outs to go and vote.
Whilst most students
were annoyed with the
continual bombardment
of election propaganda,
some individuals wel-
comed the infinitely
increased attention.
Some have speculated
that such a system will
leave other (still impor-
tant) positions open to
inadequate candidates
where an unsuccessful
sabbatical candidate
would normally stand.
In what is considered
to be the most shocking
exploitation of “Freebie”
theory, the Onion decid-
ed to heavily invest in a
free iPad 2 for everyone
who voted. The saving
grace of this was that
the tablets were bought
in bulk just before the
release of the iPad 3,
costing the Onion mar-
ginally less. With such
an incentive irresistible
to the majority of under-
graduates, the costly
initiative succeeded
in rapidly raising the
turnout of voters. How-
ever the public wish to
measure the outcome
of the event, it can not
be denied that this was
the best year for student
democracy according
to someone ‘s definition.
Outside the Onion’s
control, Imperial Memes
(a Facebook page with
over 4,000 fans) is
thought to have heavily
influenced the outcome
of the elections with
suggestive posts about
certain candidates.
All votes are likely to
be cancelled and ren-
dered void henceforth,
with Imperial joining
the heady ranks of UK
universities questioned
over election reliability.
