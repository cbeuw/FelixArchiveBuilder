Head to Head: the
Tell us a bit about yourself in one
sentence.
I’m a fourth year physicist who started
playing rugby at secondary school and
eventually chose it over football.
Over the course of your college career,
what have your Varsity experiences
been like? Are you approaching it dif-
ferently as captain?
First year I watched from the bench as
we missed a great chance to win, having
broken my clavicle earlier in the season
I wasn’t ready to start again. Second
and third year were similar, disappoint-
ing experiences where we didn’t make
the most of our chances. Nothing really
changes too much as captain, just have
to be aware of the team’s strategy as
well as your own individual role on the
pitch.
Have you been able to evaluate the
opposing team’s level, given that
you’ve only played once this year?
We played the Medics in the BUCS
cup back in November. Despite not
performing too well we won 18-10. I’m
sure they have come a fair distance since
then though, and we certainly have.
Its fair to say they’ve had a really poor
season but maybe they can pick it up for
this one off.
What are your thoughts on playing at
the Stoop? Sport Imperial have pulled
out all the stops to get people to
come to the game this year;
how important is it to have
strong support?
Its great to play at The
Stoop, knowing guys like
Care, Monye & Easter play
there week in week
out. The support
is what makes it
such an occasion
and is vital to
the evening.
We appreciate
everyone com-
ing along and
getting involved
in the singing and
banter, the louder
the better.
Do you pay attention to the other
Varsity results, or is it all about the
Rubgy?
I keep a vague eye on hockey as I have
some friends in the club but that’s about
it, to be honest.
6 Nations time: was England’s victory
against France a one-off or do you
think things are moving in the right
direction after the World Cup?
Well by reading the players’testimo-
nies the biggest change has been in
the atmosphere, apparently. There’s a
talented bunch of young guys, especially
the backs, that bodes well. Fingers
crossed for a win versus Ireland next
weekend.
How would you convince the
average Imperial student to go and
watch Varsity?
Take pride in your col-
lege and come along and
support. As well as the
rugby the cheerlead-
ers will be strutting
their stuff if that’s
your thing, and you
wouldn’t want to miss
the celebrations after
the match.
Finally, what are your
post-match celebration/com-
miseration plans?
I imagine the same as most Wednesdays,
back to the Union and then take it from
there. It will certainly be a late night
if things go our way that’s for sure!
There was a lot of basking in the glory
of promotion last week, I’m sure we
could manage it again.

A word from the
club captains
This season has not been an easy one for the medics. The medic time-
table and a number of long term injuries have led to a disrupted and
at times frustrating season in the BUCS premiership. The competition
has at times proved a little too difficult. When playing universities that
offer sports science degrees we are sometimes left a little short of
resources.
That said a number of encouraging performances have been strung
together and a lot of younger players have really come through the ranks.
Our Saturday side is doing well in London North West 2, sometimes
playing against semi-professional outfits. We have qualified for the final
of the United Hospitals Cup this fixture is being played on the 16th of
March. This is the oldest rugby competition in the world and we are hop-
ing to win the cup for the 9th time in 10 years.
In true medic form, despite what some may see as a disappointing
season, we appear to be reaching a crescendo in time for varsity. Bring
it on.
ICURFC have had a successful season, with a strong contingent of fresh-
ers, a number of whom will be playing tonight. They have bedded into the
Club well and have pushed a number of senior players. The 1st XV are
looking for promotion and had a successful cup run including victory over
Imperial Medicals. This has been the only College v Medicals fixture as
the teams compete in different leagues. It promises to be a great match
with both sides expecting victory!
Looking forward, ICURFC are excited to be touring North America this
summer. Playing a number of top American Universities including MIT,
Harvard, Princeton and Columbia, the Club is pushing the boundaries of
sport at Imperial. Players will, I am sure, be a credit to the University and
the Club.
I would like to wish both teams the best of luck and to thank ICURFC
sponsors Accenture, Citi and Find Invest Grow for their continued support
and look forward to hearing ‘Sylvia’ reverberating around the stadium
after the final whistle.
