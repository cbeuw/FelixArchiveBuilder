Captains’ interview
Tell us a bit about yourself in one
sentence.
Living up to the stereotype of a rugby
playing medic.
Over the course of your col-
lege career, what have your
Varsity experiences been
like? Are you approaching
it differently as captain?
It’s always been a great match
to be involved in from
coming on in extra time
as a fresher to captaining
the side last year at the
Stoop. Getting MoM in
2nd year is a personal highlight. It’s my
second year as captain and I don’t think
it makes that much difference really; it’s
fairly easy to get the boys pumped up for
matches like Varsity.
Have you been able to evaluate the
opposing team’s level, given that you
haven’t played each other this year?
We played them in the cup a while back so
we’ve seen a little of each other. The Col-
lege are obviously coming in off the back
off a promotion season from the league
below but we’ve been in this position be-
fore and I think the Varsity match really
is a one-off game, which is probably
why it’s such a close affair every year.
How often do your course commit-
ments clash with rugby ones? What
wins out in the end?
With two games and two training ses-
sions a week rugby takes up a lot of
time but usually people are pretty
understanding so I always put
rugby first during the season.
What are your thoughts on
playing at the Stoop?
Sport Imperial have
pulled out all the stops
to get people to come to
the game this year; how
important is it to have
strong support?
It’s not a bad pitch. Don’t think it’s a
touch on our home ground at Tedding-
ton but suppose it will have to do. It
was a brilliant atmosphere down at the
Stoop last year and it’s always amazing
to have the support of the Med school
down at the game, I think it makes
everybody raise their game.
Do you pay attention to the other
Varsity results, or is it all about the
Rubgy?
Definitely. We only really get to watch
the other rugby matches and some of
the Hockey and Football down at Har-
lington. Supporting your mates in the
other sports gets everyone a bit fired up
for the game in the evening.
Speaking of Rugby; was England’s
victory against France a one-off or
do you think things are moving in the
right direction after the World Cup?
They’re a pretty inexperienced side at
international level at the moment but the
games against Wales and France have
definitely been an improvement on the
horrible performances during the World
Cup. Think they’re probably going to
get better and better as a side the more
they play together.
How would you convince the average
Imperial student to go and watch
Varsity?
I think there’s still quite a lot of Med
school pride and spirit around so don’t
think it should be too much of a hard
sell. Even if you don’t particularly like
rugby it’s an entertaining night out
with your mates and the atmosphere is
always great.
Finally, what are your post-match cel-
ebration/commiseration plans?
Same old nonsense at the Reynolds as
every Wednesday… ideally not ending
up as a double page spread in a national
newspaper the following week.

Lineups
The 2s this year have had an up and down sea-
son. After a disappointing start against teams that
went on to top the league, our season was back on
track with back to back wins in the run up to Christ-
mas lifting us up the table. After Christmas we had
a series of narrow losses, losing two games by a
total margin of 3 points, both after being in winning
positions.
However we recovered from these with two more
wins to hopefully secure survival in the league whilst
playing some very attractive rugby. This team is a
young team and has grown in confidence and ability
throughout the season leaving us in a strong posi-
tion for Varsity and the future.
