Survive the iCU Cinema All-Nighter
How to:
I
t has returned. It’s coming to the
end of term and just when you
thought you might look forward
to a bit of shut-eye, BAM! iCU
Cinema phwacks you in the gut
with an All-Nighter. Six films, back-to-
back, from the early evening to 6am the
next morning, or until the projectionist
goes insane and feeds his hair into the
projector, whichever comes first.
One might reasonably ask, “How on
earth does one survive such a test of en-
durance?” Well, it just so happens that
I prepared a thorough and completely
unscientific guide to all those who dare
accept the iCU Cinema All-Nighter
challenge.
Imagine the scenario: it’s around 2am,
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has
just finished, and you’re all feeling a bit
abused, both by the film and by the fact
that you’re now three films in. You’re
buying a cup of tea when the hot guy
or girl beside you realises they haven’t
got change for a Pot Noodle. Jackpot!
Swoop in with a couple of 50p coins and
a cool remark about how “the original
Swedish version was way better” and,
hail mary!, you’ve got a duvet buddy.
Note: if you don’t bring some change,
this will never happen and you’ll never
find happiness... ever.
Timetable
18:00 – Mission: Impossible
– Ghost Protocol
20:45 – Sherlock Holmes:
A Game of Shadows
23:30 – The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo
02:30 – Puss in Boots
04:30 – Moneyball
06:00 – Attack the Block
Tickets are £10 in advance
at tickets.icucinema.co.uk, or
£12 on the door. Individual
films are £3 on the door.
Hot and cold food & drinks
will be on sale throughout the
night. (Including beers, coffee
and cider!)
Before I begin, let me reassure you: it
is possible. Almost. There are rumours
that Chuck Norris made it to the second-
to-last film before falling serenly asleep
in his chair, mumbling something about
“roundhouse kicking Joseph Kony be-
fore it was cool”. To give yourself the
best chance of making it all the way
through the night, it’s essential that
you get a good night’s sleep on Mon-
day. You may have read articles about
how the 8-hour sleep is unnatural, and
you need two seperate sections of sleep
with sex in between (or reading, what-
ever). For the All-Nighter you’ll need to
be in bed on Monday at 6pm and not
rise from your comatose slumber until
Tuesday 1:37pm (at the earliest).
Mission: Impossible?
Coffee is your friend
Of course, being the independent-mind-
ed and strong-willed Imperial students
that you are, you may choose to ignore
my sleep advice. I would warn you to
The girl with the pillow
Have you ever been to one of those
fancy cinemas that have sofas instead
of normal seats? They’re awesome,
aren’t they? A truly luxurious cinemat-
ic experience. iCU Cinema is not one
of those cinemas. More than 12 hours
sitting on the Union’s standard-issue
fold-out seats will do ghastly things to
your body that would see even the har-
diest Medic run for the hills screaming,
“THERE IS NO GOD!” Pro-tip: bring
a pillow, bring a duvet; heck, wear py-
jamas and bust out those man-uggs you
keep pretending you don’t have.
Moneyballs
I might as well go ahead and put this out
there now: you can pretty much write
off anything you were planning to do
on Wednesday. That includes: lectures;
that super-important meeting with your
project supervisor, and that lunch with
Attack the fry up
Puss in bed
do so at your own peril, and to hell with
you, but my colleagues at iCU Cinema
are more sympathetic. Hot, fresh cof-
fee is piped in from the fields of South
America via a mind-bendingly long
pipe that looks mysteriously like a jar of
Nescafe, a paper cup, and some scald-
ing hot water... The crack-like caffeine
is your only weapon against the oblivi-
on of sleep so use it; but use it wisely.
Ah, one other thing – tea and beer are
also on sale. Certainly they are more de-
licious than coffee, and the beer is like-
ly to make even Puss in Boots a riotous
laugh, but help you stay awake until the
morning, they do not...
So, let’s say we’ve come to the end of
the All-Nighter. You’re feeling proud
of yourself no doubt. Only problem is
you’ve got to re-enter the land of the
living, and we all know what a terrible,
deadline-infested place that can be.
What you really need is an infusion of
good, strong, deadly cholesterol. Luck-
ily the SCR does a bang up breakfast.
Or if you’re feeling really adventurous,
seek out the Contractors’ Cafe – just
on the other side of the walkway to the
Queen’s Lawn. Seek, and ye shall find
affordable breakfast of the likes ye only
find at the Sandwich Shop.
your boyfriend/girlfriend that you total-
ly promised to not be late for. The crazy
shit that summoned the dead from their
graves in Dawn of the Dead won’t be
enough to get you out of bed after the
All-Nighter. Your only other option is
to go hard and just power through with
crack-caffeine, because as soon as you
go home you’re done.
If you’re planning on coming to the iCU
Cinema All-Nighter, tweet @iCU_Cine-
ma and let us know how the preparations
are going. The fact that you will have
tweeted us is a bad sign; you should be
asleep, charging your batteries!
