FELIX EASTER EGG REVIEW 2012
The Felix team deliver their own withering verdicts on this year’s chocolate menagerie
4/5
Maltesers
Much like the Maltese
Falcon from which
this popular chocolate
brand derives its name,
there’s more here than
meets the eye. Malte-
ser chocolate actually
has a suprisingly com-
plex flavour, which is re-
flected in this rich and
rewarding egg.
“Loving it!”
3/5
Thorntons
Despite portraying
themselves as pur-
veyors of wealth and
prosperity, Thorntons
dropp the ball with this
extremely average egg,
giving way to churlish
taunts being hurled
across the office.
“For little girls only”
“Rich... like me.”
3/5
Sainsbury’s Taste
the Difference
Giant Bunny
In a risky Easter strat-
egy, Sainsbury’s have
gone after both quality
and quantity with this
massive bunny. Oh well,
one out of two ain’t bad.
“Says ‘Taste the Differ-
ence’ but tastes like
every other bunny” 3/5
Baileys
Definitely the most
complex flavour on the
table, the Baileys be-
hemoth has as rich a
bouquet as some fine
wines.
“Smells of musty
rooms and old wooden
bookcases. The sort of
thing that would spark
flashbacks in your
gran’s mind”
3/5
Green & Black’s
Described by one con-
fused individual as ‘the
Queen Latifah of eggs’,
this offering from the
favourite brand of sub-
urban yuppies fails to
take the Felix Easter
Egg review crown.
“Chunky, rich, meaty
at times”
“Love the aftertaste”
2/5
Mini Eggs
Despite being an ordi-
nary looking egg com-
posed of the standard
Cadbury’s Dairy Milk,
several religious cults
have sprung up in the
Felix office around
these mysterious orbs.
“I would do anything
for Mini Eggs”
“Boring but acceptable” 1/5
SpongeBob
SquarePants
You see that face? That
yellow, pourous visage?
That’s not a smile, son.
That’s a scream. The
scream of someone
forced to eat this ter-
rible, terrible egg.
“Shit”
“Unacceptable”
5/5
Lindor by Lindt
Beneath its golden ex-
terior lies Lindt’s usual
soft chocolate experi-
ence, but it’s on the
miniature egg truffles
where this Easter offer-
ing truly shines. Fun for
the whole family.
“It melts in my mouth!”
“Sexy and seductive,
it’s almost too much”
