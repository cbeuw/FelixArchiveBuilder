Russell Group extends its reach
to four more institutions
The Russell Group has agreed to
extend its membership to four more
universities. Durham, Exeter, Queen
Mary and York are the four institu-
tions that will join the traditionally
20-strong association of public re-
search universities, of which Imperial
College London is a member.
The Russell Group, established in
1994 after an expansion in the uni-
versity sector, will now represent 24
UK research-intensive universities.
The group works towards its main
aim of leading the UK’s research ef-
fort by lobbying the government and
parliament. It has recently come into
opposition with students’ unions over
its strong support of the introduction
of tuition fees. The four new institu-
tions were all previously members
of the 1994 Group, which represents
smaller research-led institutions, and
now stands at 15 members.

Professor Michael Farthing, Chair
of the 1994 Group and Vice Chan-
cellor of the University of Sussex
responded to the departure with the
following statement: “It is disap-
pointing that these institutions have
decided to leave the 1994 Group, but
I wish them well in their new mission
group.”
Professor Michael Arthur, Chair of
the Russell Group and Vice Chancel-
lor of the University of Leeds, said of
the news: “[the newly joined univer-
sities] have demonstrated that – like
all other Russell Group members –
they excel in research, innovation and
education and have a critical mass of
research excellence across a wide
range of disciplines.”
The new universities will become
members in effect from August 2012.
Tickets are now on sale for this year’s
scaled-down Summer Ball. Promising
a “transformed South Kensington cam-
pus” and marking the return of a black
tie formal dinner option, the Union has
sought to firmly overview the financial
risk of the event in order to avoid a sub-
stantial loss such as that sustained at the
2011 Summer Ball.
While in previous years the College
has provided a subsidy of approximate-
ly £22,000 in order to help with the
organisation of the event it emerged in
February that the College do not intend
to provide funding for the organisation
of this year’s Ball.
£13,000 has been set aside for DJs
and Band Fees, based on one smaller
headline act. Deputy President (Fi-
nance & Services) Michael Foster told
Felix that organisers are “not yet at the
stage” at which acts can be confirmed,
following similar timetabling in previ-
ous years.
The budgeted figure of £5,500 for
the returning funfair – one of the most
popular aspects of last year’s event fol-
lowing a Felix survey late last year – is
currently based on the hire of two rides
and one inflatable.
Following student feedback, the for-
mal dinner option returns after its ab-
sence last year. 178 formal dinner ticket
purchases at £40 each are required by
the beginning of May for the black tie
event to go ahead alongside the Ball
itself. If the dinner does not go ahead,
a full refund will be provided to dinner
ticket holders.
The ticket for the Ball itself has been
reduced from £45 to £30. With a third
removed from last year’s price, poten-
tial attendees will no doubt been keen
for further details as to whether the
scaled-down event will be worth the
value.

More Summer
Ball plans out-
lined
listed for positions they were not
standing for or, in some cases, for two
different positions. While the issues
had been rectified before noon on
Monday some 1000 people had voted
by that time.
Votes could potentially be struck
from a certain time period of the
election for the Deputy President
(Welfare) position following ongoing
discussions of Union Court.
Voting closes at 23:59 today and
results will be announced early next
week.
