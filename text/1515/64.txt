ast Wednesday saw Impe-
rial rugby 1st team take
on St Mary’s in the league
title decider. Both teams
were tied on points and
promotion was at stake, it was going
to be the toughest game of the sea-
son. The conditions during the warm
up were standard Harlington; it was
cold, wet and windy. James Cox got
the game under way, and a good start
saw IC remain camped in St Mary’s
half for the first ten minutes. It wasn’t
long before Mary’s conceded a penalty
under the pressure. A kick to touch put
IC in their favourite position – an at-
tacking line out on the five metre line!
Sean ‘the Beast’ Baker was unfortunate
not to score the opening try, the referee
judging that the ball was held up over
the line. However, the IC pack was de-
termined to register some points, and
the resulting scrum saw a classic 8, 9,
14 move rewarded with a try from Jack
Judd. Sadly Jack was injured for his ef-
forts, so Freddy White was introduced
to the action. As the half progressed, St
Mary’s started to come more and more
into the game. However, good work in
the line out by Captain Charlie Esberg-
er limited their attacking options; and
good defence in the midfield, notably
from Mike Floyd, forced St Marys to
settle for a successful 3 point penalty.
The half time score was 5-3.
St Mary’s got the second half under-
way. Neither team seemed to be able
to break the others defence; poor condi-
tions gave wingers Fraser ‘the Salmon’
James and Ed Durkin little to work
with. However, a good spell of play
positioned the Imperial forwards once
again in their favourite position. With
hooker Rob Kyle’s throwing on form,
the result was inevitable – a try for ‘the
Beast’. James Cox stepped up to add
the extras from a difficult position. The
next twenty minutes saw heroic de-
fence from imperial, man of the match
Chris McGeough putting in a couple of
noteworthy big hits. The poor condi-
tions meant a lot scrums and the back ...Continued on Page 55

row players, Jack Flanagan, Jon Hard-
isty and Olisa Ufodiama, did extremely
well to keep the St Marys number eight
from gaining anything off the back of
them. As the Imperial line held strong,
it wasn’t long before the frustration
caused St Mary’s to force one pass too
many, resulting in a knock on. Good
scrummaging from Simon Fenton and
James Scaife gave a good platform for
scrum half Olly Cox to ease the pres-
sure. With full time approaching, St
