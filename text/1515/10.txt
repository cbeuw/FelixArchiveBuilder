transfixed as a statue on a plinth of ice.
“Johnny, please!”
Johnny just gave a derisive chuckle.
“No.”
Agleam of silver caught the moonlight
and shone coldly. The hammer was par-
ticularly shiny, devoid of any rust.
“How many roads must a man walk
down?” Johnny smiled, a thin slit cutting
his cheeks. Danny’s unsteady legs buck-
led and he fell to his knees, hands on his
head, pulling at his hair. His brown suit,
originally a ruddy hue, was stained with
dirt from the thigh down and sweat from
the belly up. A faded tie failed to conceal
his mighty gut, which he had lavishly
filled only hours ago.
“I…I d-don’t know!” He was tearing
at the eyes now, nose running grotesque-
ly. “What are you talking about?”
“You know exactly what I’m talking
about.” Johnny hissed, moving closer so
that his pale, cold grey eyes could stare
down into Danny’s horrible brown ones,
close enough to draw in the stench of
onions and fear. “You betrayed me.” He
forced out every syllable. “You led Sid
A
lonely tree stood solitary
on a darkening hill. Its
branches were bare and
no birds would roost in its
empty canopy. The bark
towards its trunk was peeling off and
patchy in many places giving a diseased
appearance. Gnarled roots grew twisted
in the parched earth, meaning that the
whole tree leaned crookedly on its base.
Sparse vegetation had appeared on the
hill, sun-dyed brown, and now coated in
sweaty dew.
Two men stood beneath the tree. One
was shaking, as if from extreme cold,
while the other was calm and assured.
“I told ya I’d find ya.” The second man
breathed. “And I told ya, what I’d do to
ya.”
There were no clouds in the sky to
shroud the stars, not that any could be
seen on such a dark night as this. The
air was still – no wind had stirred since
before sunset – and the silence was un-
settling.
“I ain’t never meant for this to hap-
pen!” blubbered the first man, stiff and
straight to her. And then you kept it from
me.”
“No! I-I…” Danny choked. “Sh-She
went for h-him. She’s the one to blame.
Not me!” He whispered. A dog barked
somewhere distant, its deep growl mag-
nified in the taut silence.
“Lies!” Johnny shouted. “I suppose
it is fitting for you to die on your knees
like the scoundrel mutt that you are. I
just wish Blue-Louie’d never pulled you
from Lachrymal Lake. It would’ve been
so … easy … to let you drown.”
The metal face looked straight into
Danny’s, who almost fainted at the sight
of it. “Don’t! You need…” He didn’t
even get a chance to finish the sentence.
The air around the dead tree exploded
and blood pooled onto the dirt, quench-
ing the grass. Three shots in total.Aslow
draught finally fluttered over the hill,
carrying away the gunsmoke, and the
smell of death.
Johnny looked down at Danny’s mar-
ble face with contempt. He spat on it.
“You should never have meddled
in this boy.” He chastised the corpse.
“Looks like this man won’t be walking
down no more roads. What a shame.”
Johnny pulled his coat around himself
tighter, stowing his gun away from the
forsaking moon. He was about to walk
away before he turned around and kicked
at the body so Danny now lay sprawled
on his large stomach. Then once more at
his groin. He lent down and whispered
into Danny’s ear, blood still dripping out
of it.
“Tell Sid; this time I showed you mer-
cy! He won’t be so lucky.”
With that Johnny swept up like a bat
and hurried away from the scene, anx-
ious to not be discovered, and ardent on
the pursuit of his next prey. One down,
he thought.
The crickets’ started a gentle hum,
which crescendoed as Johnny eventually
left.
The tree stood just as before.
