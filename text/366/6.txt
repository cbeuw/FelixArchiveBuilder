Last Thursday at the Maths
Freshers Dinner, the C & GU
in a well planned split second
raid, made off with the RCS
mascot Theta whi le sherry
was in progress. The first
sign that there was anything
fishy afoot was when Dave
Barnes, the Guilds V . P .
entered wearing an orange
anti vomit kit of cagoule,
overtrousers and an umbrella.
A few minutes later one of
the wine waiters rushed in and
said to Pete Teague the RCSU
President in hushed whispers
that Theta was missing. (I
happened to be only about a
metre away from them at the
time). Mr. Teague's reaction
was to dash out immediately
into the kitchen area obviously
in pursuit of the souvenir
hunters of C & GU.
After this, things proceeded
in a rather, sombre mood with
the Theta bearer being sent
out to retrieve the mascot.
The Kangala was sung without
Theta with Dave Barnes unable
to keep a self satisfied smile
from his face.
The theft was accomplished
in the following way. Dave
Barnes enters the ante-room
in blazing colour with four
other Guilds reprobates who
were there to keep tabs on the
inside. Meanwhile, another
four Guildsmen entered the
kitchen from the back and two
of them made off with Theta
through the kitchen and up
into the buttery, followed by
the others about 10 yards
behind. In the buttery the four
went through the door by
the cash register where Theta
was handed on. Everyone then
went through the double doors
which were then roped and
barred. The four then went
downstairs noisily, eventually
coming out through the Consort
Gallery but without Theta.
Theta was rapidly whisked
up to level 3 of College Block,
along the staircase that
descends past Alan's bar,
down to level 1 and into a car
and away.
John Mortimer wrote to
Jenny Jones congratulating
Guilds on their Herculean feat,
the first part of which runs:
'II was with great pleasure,
tinted with the resplendent
hue of mediocre jealously, that
I heard this evening of your
commendable success in the
procurementof theRCS mascot.
It was, without doubt, a fine
effort on behalf of your team.
May I add, that I noted with
particular gratification that
an Old Caterhamiam played
such an impressive roll in
this masterpiece of inter-
collegiate strategy'.
Since then there has been
an attempt to get Theta back
albeit an unsuccessful one.
Also several RCS morons
ransacked the C & GU office
on Friday 18th October, 1974.
in the evening. They stole
four shields from the wall,
the Morphy Oar and damaged
some of the Lord Mayor's
Show gear. This was a sense-
less act of violence especially
as the shields that were taken
are inviolate articles.
The Guilds Union are
receiving the old treasure hunt
trick for getting back Theta.
Unfortunately the first clue
is being delayed until the
stolen shields are returned
and damage paid for.
The C & GU had a silly
sports day on Saturday and
collected Â£183.92'/2. Jenny
also tells me that Bo* went
for a run round Hyde Park last
Wednesday morning and she
fired first time. It was also
the occasion of the first
presidential trip in Bo'*. There
is to be a party for Bow on the
1st November, 1974. The
Friday before the Brighton
run at which Bo* will be
unofficially appearing.
