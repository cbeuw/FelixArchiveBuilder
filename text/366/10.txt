SWIMMING .&
WATER POLO
paul hindle
With a hired van and a
battered Morris 1000, eight
sturdy members of the Swim-
ming club set off in the early
hours of Saturday 15 th June,
for the depths of deepest
Dorset to do battle against
four of the local Water Polo
teams.
Sunday, the day of our 1st
match, greeted us with glorious
sunshine, however the water
in the open air Seawater Pool
at Lymington was not quite so
welcoming. We managed a
5-4 victory thanks to stirring
work in defence by Jim Williams
who saved us from certain
defeat.
Monday arrived in a similar
manner, only this time we had
the whole day to train and
practice before the evening's
match against Bridfort at
Westbay, We arrived in Westbay
to find the pitch marked out
in the local river. What had
we let ourselves in for? It was
the coldest open sewer we
have ever swum in but inspite
of the hardships we won 10-3.
The best goal being a rare
Bluebottle Flip in the 3rd
quarter.
Wednesday was to be the
hardest day of the tour with
two matches. The first against
the Young Officers of Bovington
Camp, tnspite the referees
initial belief that we had not
played before, we came out as
5 4-0 victors. The squad was
at last playing as a team and
found the ill-organised army
team easy prey.
As expected the last match
proved to be the hardest of
the tour. The experienced team
of Taunton S.C. fell to our
much superior teamwork to the
tune of 13-2.
After a well earned rest
on Thursday, the team of
Paul Hindle, Andy Smith,
Paul Taylor, Mike McCartney,
Mark Taylor, Jim Williams,
Cliff Spooner and Colin Henson
headed back to London well
pleased with the victories and
the highly enjoyable spirit in
which the whole tour was
conducted. Special thanks
must go to Dimitri Ilic and
Brian Dear without whom the
tour could not have happened.
We still need male swim-
mers to supplement our three
successful teams. So whether
you've played water polo
before or not, come and try it
any Monday or Friday from
7p.m. till 9p.m.
