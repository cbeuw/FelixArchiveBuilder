F I L J X
ASTONISHINGLY enough, perhaps
the criticisms recently aimed at F E L I X
have been welcomed by the Editor, for
they collectively raise the fundamental
issue: Too many people are totally
ignorant of the complexities and draw-
backs involved with printing F E L I X by
Offset-lithography. A l l the text of
F E L I X has to be typeset on a machine
called a Varityper. It i s a super-
typewriter (super to the extent that
a re-conditioned model costs over
£2,000); it has interchangeable type
faces and it has provision whereby the
two sides of a column of text can be
made parallel. This process, called
justification, takes exactly twice the
amount of time it would normally take
to type the text, because everything
has to be typed out twice.
We have a Varityper on the Union
premises and College has provided us
with a full-time operator, but as you
must by now surely realise, were
there to be a sudden glut of news mid-
week, we would not be able to print
it all, because it could not be typeset
in time. So simply due to the circum-
stances that surround the production,
FELIX'S topicality is threatened.
'But', you will say, ' this never happened
last year, did it? Late news sometimes
went in on Sunday night and FELIX
still appeared Tuesday morning'.
But last year FELIX was printed using
Rotary Letterpress by an outside
printing firm — experts in their trade —
to whom edited copy was sent with
layout instructions. In those days there
was no 'Damn, the glue has smudged'
or 'How on earth are we going to fill
that spare inch on page 3' or even
'God, this letrasetting takes such a
long time'.
Times have changed. The com-
mitment required of the Editor and his
staff has changed. The sooner people
recognise that, the better.
It is extremely tempting to facetiously
re-name the 'Letters' column as 'The
Bitching Column'. Such an inappropriate
title would naturally belie the true
function of the column, which is there
so that people can make a point in
public which they feel to be very
important. They are not making a fuss
just for its own sake as in the case
of the rather whimsical space-filler on
the back of the recent Guildsheet Extra.
Due to the apparent necessity of
printing NUS motions, some ads and
articles had to be omitted in this issue.
Every effort will be made to print
them next week where appropriate.

Sir,
I would like through the
pages of this publication to
make a comment on the non-
intercollegiate attitude of
Mr. K i l l , the Deputy President
of ICU, and Mrs. Gerrard, the
Honorary Secretary of I C U .
As well you know, Theta
the mascotof RCS was snatched
by City and Guilds Union on
Thursday. However, on several
occasions since then I and
other members of my Union
have heard them actively
encouraging members of RCS
to take some retaliatory steps
and generally talking in a
very pro-RCS fashion that I
could well expect Mr. Teague
to use. How responsible are
they for the stupid attack on
Guilds Union Office on Friday
night?
In present times, when we
have been having long dis-
cussions about the roles of
the CCU's and ICU, and trying
to build a strong structure'
this attitude of the Hon. Sec.
and the D.P. seems extremely
unwarranted.
When someone is elected
to such an esteemed position,
I would have expected them to
leave behind the'petty wrang-
lings and rivalry of the C C U ' s '
to quote one of them. However,
it seems that they insist on
remaining 'active' members
of RCS and hence I wonder
whether they are capable or
even worthy of helping to
create this strong and stable
structure that all would agree
we need!
Yours faithfully,
Jenny Jones,

Dear Sir,
We, the undersigned, are
extremely put out by the
distinct lack of sports coverage
in todays F E L I X . We feel sure
that people are more interested
in reading sports reports than
some of the articles and adverts
that are obviously designed
to pad out each issue. Further-
more we understand from the
Sports Editor that three sides
of F E L I X were originally
designated for these reports
and accordingly we supplied
more than enough good material
for 2 pages.
The Sports Editor informs
us that the reason for this
purge of reports is that you
expect him to edit these pages.
Do you really expect the
Sports Editor in his precious
spare time to edit 2-3 pages
while you waste a paid sab-
batical year churning out nine
pages of rubbish.
We feel that it i s your
responsibility to edit and
publish sports reports, and
look forward to seeing IC
Sport fully reported in next
weeks F E L I X .
Yours faithfully,
