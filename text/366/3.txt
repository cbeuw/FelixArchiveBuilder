usurious publication which you
have the honour to perpetrate.
The path of this paper,
namely F E L I X , seems to be
following the fate of the
proverbial 'pound in your
pocket' and after the recent
devaluation it does not appear
to be rallying.
It does not seem to us the
Watergatian exposure of the
bickering in the Kindergarten
inhabited by the editorial staff
represents the views and
interests of the students here
at Imperial College (and the
Instnut Francais?), and we
would like to suggest the
purchase of a tin of Johnson's
baby powder to put on each
other's botties to facilitate
the comfort of your various
inflamations.
Obviously your desire to
produce the ultimate in College
journalism is producing some-
thing completely unpalatable,
and we would like, that
instead of talking in terms of
'Media Meetings', you came
down from the Utopia of your
Olympian heights, otherwise
you stand in danger of tumbling
into the abyss of Mass
Mediocrity.
We hope that by contributing
this letter we will add a
little colour to the otherwise
blank face of F E L I X , and also
hope that instead of chasing
the excesses of your sense
of the dramatic, you the Editor,
concentrate on improving your
lamentable English, not to
mention deplorable French.
It remains our pleasure
't'accuser' and your excuse
to say 'on maccuse'', so
please dry the tears from
your eyes.

Dear Sir,
Perhaps I should entitle
this letter 'Sex and the
Single Engineer' or something
similarly eye catching, but
seriously, how does a post-
graduate girl get to meet a
few fellas socially? Go to
a Freshers' teeny bop??
Being the only girl I know
at IC isn't as much fun as
it sounds — not one single
male has yet suggested we
share so much as a coffee.
So, Tom Abraham, how
about ICPGG arranging some-
thing sociable so I can get
to meet a few people.
Yours sincerely,
'A Rose By Any
Other Name'

The beautiful young lady
in this week's page three
feature is Fiona Foley.
She is in> Zoology 1. She
hails from Hamshire on the
South Coast, bang opposite
the Isle of Wight. Fiona's
interests are motor racing
and drinking (whisky and
soda though wine and beer
go down well also) and
since coming to IC she has
taken up rowing and quote
'I'm a very good stroker'.
Well that's all I can tell
you about her folks, apart
from the fact that she has
a really incredible nickname
and is now aiding and
abetting the RCSU in various
ways.

IT SEEMS that IF is really facing hard times. When the
newspapers for the common room are cut by half (and there
were only two anyway) you know you're on the rocks. From now
on it's a question of survival. Of course smaller colleges are
bound to feel the effects of the present crisis sooner and more
acutely than others, but on top of that we seem to be attracting
less applications, last year we numbered 250, this year 200, and
next year? These IF birds seem to be a dying species. This of
be due to a
course, can
number of reasons entirely
independant of the college,
the cost of living in London
and the accommodation
problem which are affecting
us more and more, are but
two. Meantime, when it
comes to looking for support
we tend to fall between two
chairs; as far as the auth-
orities are concerned we are
a french establishment (God
forbid), as far as the french
are concernedweareEnglish.
Needless to say this drop
in numbers directly affects
the Union and we find our-
selves with considerably
less funds than last year
which in turn limits our
activities and makes us
increasingly dependent on
larger colleges. A case of:
you provide the facilities
and we provide the females.
A number of IC societies are
enthusiastically supported
by girls from IF, particularly
folk club, ski club, dram soc.
(of which the female con-
tingent is almost entirely
from IF) and ICWSC (which
incidentally is the only
society to my knowledge
that charges girls from IF a
higher membership fee —
could it be that they don't
need us?) I think that this
link which has existed
between IF and IC for some
years now should be en-
couraged which is why we
are always willing to combine
efforts in organising some-
thing. So, any suggestions?
(-as the actress said to the
Bishop).
Meanwhile, of course, IC
students are always welcome
to use our extensive facilities
which include two common
rooms (with drink machines,
no less!) and a union room
at least four times bigger
than Mines' union, and wait
for it — a rest room, which
unfortunately is always
locked. In fact, no-one
appears to have actually
seen the inside of this room
but any rumours suggesting
that the door opens on to a
brick wall are strongly denied.
One might believe that
this lack of facilities or
rather 'centralisation' as one
of our french lecturers put
it, might enable one to bully,
persuade, threaten the girls
into coercive activity; not
so, once inside the front
door the IF girl becomes
strangely elusive, with an
amazing aptitude for ignoring
posters, leaflets, handouts,
and all in all, a resistance
to bumph equalled only by
the IC male. However, the
enthusiasm of the minority
certainly makes up for the
rest, and this we hope to
show by our participation in
Rag this year — that is, if
we ever get notification of
a Rag meeting.
This week saw a great
literary achievement in the
form of Ents sheet, un-
fortunately the content was
a little on the thin side for
the simple reason that
although the grapevine is
going strong it is not al-
together reliable and we
cannot publicise events
which we don't know about.
This fortnightly paper has
a wide circulation, so in
order to take advantage of
this to advertise your events,
pick up the phone (between
1.00 and 1.30p.m.) dial
584 9882 and state what,
when, where, and how much,
and before your very eyes
(or a week or so later) it
will appear in print. It
could hardly be simpler.
Finally you may have
noticed some scaffolding in
front of IF during the past
week. It seems that it is
having a face lift. Well, I
know I did mention the other
week 71a peeling walls and
general look of neglect' but
I hardly expected to be
taken seriously. After all,
it had character.
