THE BULK of £40,000 of
Union today remain frozen by
Senate of the University.
This decision follows the
appointment by the Union of
JefffStaniforth to the post of
its.- permanent Secretary.
Previously the Union and the
Steering Committee made this
appointment jointly, however,
it is believed that the com-
mittee's decision is related
to Jeff Staniforth's previous
position as NUS treasurer for
two years.
The funds were frozen on
October 2nd, after a union
meeting, attended by 1200
students, endorsed the ap-
pointment of Jeff Staniforth.
A legal advisor from NUS said
there is no precedent for the
freeze and the University
authorities would probably
lose the case in court. More-
over, the authorities appear
unable to produce an alternative
appointee.
£16,000 was released to
the Union (£13,000 to clear
last year's deficit) but the
committee refuse to allow
Mr. Staniforth's salary to be
paid. This resulted in the new
Arts Centre being occupied
from Tuesday afternoon to
Thursday following a Union
General Meeting decision on
October 8th. The University

funds due to Warwick Students
the Steering Committee of the
authorities then had a meeting
with Union Officers. At this,
the Steering Committee agreed
to release the first instalment
of local education authority
grants. The University also
agreed to recognise Jeff
Staniforth but not as permanent
Secretary. They will call him
'Senior Administrator', and
recognise him in any dealings
with the University. The
feeling at Warwick is that this
is not really a concession as
Mr. Staniforth's job is to
administer the new Union
building not 'haggle with
University bureaucrats'.
When I spoke to Jeff
Staniforth by phone he re-
iterated this point saying
'The real issue is who controls
the new Union building'.
It has taken seven years of
effort to get the building,
which will be completed next
year. Jeff Staniforth also
remarked on the farcical
aspects of the situation
likening it to 'a Monty Python
sketch with people running
around with memos'.
On a more serious note the
President of Warwick Univ-
ersity Students Union said
'The University's refusal to
allow the Union to appoint the
staff who it feels would be
best for the job raises the
whole question of student
Union autonomy'. NUS
President John Randall issued
a statement saying, 'We
support the Warwick students
in their stand. A students'
Union's right to make its own
decisions and appoint its own
staff is a crucial right for
which NUS has fought and will
fight again'.
