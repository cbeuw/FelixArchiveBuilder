[PERIAD
COLLEGE
DAODO
AFTER OVER five years hard work, battling
against biased transistors and bureaucrats,
Imperial College Radio was granted permission
to broadcast on medium wave radio from
December 2, 1978. To celebrate our second
'birthday', IC Radio is holding a Birthday Party
in Stan's Bar, Southside between 8:00pm and
11:00pm on Sunday November 30 (which has
been designated our OFFICIAL birthday!).
The party will be a live programme from the
bar, presented by Dave Fuller and Simon
Milner and, of course, all those in the bar! The
programme will include brief snatches of past
events on IC Radio — such highlights as the
attempt on the 'Most People In A Supermarket
Trolley' record, from a live programme in the
bar two years ago; an infamous programme
'live' from Fulham last year, and other items to
be hastily disinterred from their resting places.
But the main activities of the evening will be
party events actually in Stan's Bar —
competitions to win LPs and singles, attempts
on the record for the fastest time to eat a
packet of crips (without a drink), live music in
the bar from RCSU's 'pianist' Barney McCabe
and others, and Dave Fuller will be doing
amazing things with a crocodile called R e g . . . .
No birthday party would be complete
without a cake, and this party will be no
exception, as there will be a specially-made
cake with the IC Radio Crocodile iced on top.
Those who don't fancy crocodile flavour can
try the crisp-easting contest!
Absolutely anyone is welcome to come to
Stan's for the party — you can take part or just
watch, but either way it will be a memorable
evening, so be there or be square!
THE LAST WEEK of this term gives you your
chance to force your musical opinions on an
unsuspecting public! During that week,
Imperial College Radio will be broadcasting
'Santa's List' — a chart of the all-time favourite
pieces of rock music compiled almost entirely
from the preferences of IC students.
To do this properly, IC RADIO want to get
as broad a sample of people's tastes as
possible, and this is where you can affect the
result. All you have to do is make a list of your
five favourite tracks — be they rock, pop, folk,
r e g g a e o r a n y t h i n g e l s e . If y o u m a k e s u c h a list,

ICCAG
MANY THOUSANDS OF OLD PEOPLE DIE
every year from hypothermia — a figure which
could be drastically reduced if enough ordinary
people like you and me cared. Exams are a long
way off yet, so nou; is the time to do something
really worthwhile with your time.
Please help us with our Home Insulation
Project, organised by the Westminster Volunteer
Bureau. This involves fitting draught excluders,
etc., mainly in old people's flats (absolutely no
experience required), thus helping also to reduce
their fuel bills, and providing much needed
company for them at the same time. If you can
help, either regularly or occasionally, any day of
the week (surely you have some free time?!),
come to our meeting on Monday, December 1,
soon after 12:30 in the ICCAG Office (top floor,
Union Building; turn left) — we'll be very pleased
to see you.
Also at that meeting you can find out more
about the Acton Saturday Venture Club for
handicapped children and their friends. A small
group went last week, and enthusiastically
reported: " A really enjoyable and rewarding way
to spend a few hours on a Saturday afternoon".
If you are interested, but cannot attend the
meeting, contact me, or Sean Coyle, Elec Eng 2,
for details.

Mech Eng Soc
Lecture
THE AVERAGE attendance at Mech Eng Soc's
lectures so far this year has been over 300 and on
our first trip, the demand for places exceeded the
supply and we unfortunately had to turn some
people away.
In the near future, we are planning visits to
British Aerospace (Kingston) and possibly a full
day trip to Westland Helicopters, but the next
date not to be missed is Tuesday. December 2, at
1:00pm, when, thanks to the world-wide influence
of our 'ace' secretary, Bill Blackburn, a lecture on
the new BL Mini-Metro production line will be
presented by Dr R D Butler from BL's Project
Control and Development dept in Mech Eng 220
(Gasp! What a scoop, eh?).
So, whichever department you are in, (we have
nothing against scientists; most become
engineers of a sort in later life) don't miss this
chance to find out more about one of the most
exciting things to nearly happen to British
industry for ever such a long time.

Motor Club
FOR ALL YOU members who can't be bothered
to read the club rag 'Crank', here are details of
the forthcoming events.
Saturday, November 29 sees a trip to
Brandshatch, where you can blast around the
track in your own heap, terrifying all.
Sunday, November 30, in harsh contrast is the
County Treasure Hunt. Bring along as many as
possible to spot the clues, and drive the car for
you if you've had the halfway win!
Friday, December 5 is another fabulous rally,
organised by our knowledgeable captain. Get
your entry in before all spaces are filled.
Finally, there will be a Christmas Dinner at a
local hotel on Wednesday, December 10. For
further details, watch the Club Noticeboard.
Keep the leather to the metal!
Bulletin
from
Health Centre
Dr Anthony Haines of the College Health Centre
has written to FELIX alerting us to the real
dangers of contracting malaria through travel
abroad. Recently, there have been one or two
unfortunate incidents where senior members of
universities at other places have contracted the
disease.
The latest information on anti-malarial tablets is
below:
Antimalarial Prophylaxis
Tropics and Sub-Tropics
Of all the medical hazards that face the traveller,
malaria is the greatest. Attempts at eradication
have been quite unsuccessful. You are most
unwise if you do not take antimalarial pills and
take them regularly in the state dose. There are
variations from area to area in the resistance of
the malaria parasites to various prophylactic
tablets, but the following are as likely as any to be
effective. Avoid taking other antimalarial tablets.
Africa - For Kenya
Take Maloprim (Pyrimethamine and dapsone).
Take two tablets at least a week before going, and
then one tablet every Sunday and Wednesday,
and continue for six weeks after you come home.
For the rest of Africa
At present, normally take Chlorquine. Take two
tablets twice a week starting a week before you
depart, and continue for six weeks after you
come home. Some makers' names of Chloroquine
are Avlochlor, Nivaquine, Arlen phosphate,
Resochin; Darachlor also contains pyrime-
thamine and can be used.
Central and South America, Asia (including Asia
Minor)
Take Malorim (pyrimenthamine and dapsone).
Take two tablets at least a week before going, and
then one tablet every Sunday and Wednesday
and continue for six weeks after you come home.
Fansidar
(pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine)
Though initially active against falciparum malaria,
is now no longer a reliable prophylactice,
particularly in the Far East. It should, therefore,
not be used. Paludrine, Daraprim and other
preparations are not effective in many aprts of th
world and should not be used.
Preuenriue Measures
It is obviously important to avoid as far as
possible being bitten by the mosquito. Adequate
clothing should be worn; keeping the arms and
knees covered is helpful. Insect repellants will keep
mosquitoes away and are a useful adjunct. In
additon, the old-fashioned mosquito net is coming
back into its own, and can also play a part in
prevention. I
f you are travelling to the tropics or
sub-tropics, you are advised to consult with the
College Health Service, or with your own doctor.
It is important to bear in mind that some of the
prescribing literature which is being produced is,
in fact, out of date — and you are advised to go by
the above regime. This has been recommended
by the University Medical Officer at Oxf jrd who
is an expert in this field.
Students From Overseas
Students returning to malarial areas after even a
short period in the UK will have lost their
immunity. Therefore, they should take anti-
malarials of the specified type and dose. This is
especially important if they intend to return to this
country, for example, after a holiday. Otherwise
they should take profesional advice in their own
country about how long to continue with the anti-
malarials.
