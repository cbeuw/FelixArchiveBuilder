Mutant Frogs
Don't you dare forget to go to the U G M at
1:00pm on Tuesday in the Great Hall. Find
out the truth about the seven mutated frogs
with inborn muscular dystrophy stalking the
campus. Surely this presents a biohazard to us
all!

Puzzle Corner
By Scaramouche
The choir committee was engaged in heated
debate over which composers should feature
in their next concert.
"We should have a varied programme writh
at least three different composers including
Handel," said the Chairman.
"Let's do something classical — Mozart or
H a y d n or preferably b o t h " put in the
secretary.
"Well, we can't perform both Haydn and
Bach," said someone.
"And if we do sing anything by Bach, we
mustn't have Handel in the same concert."
" A s a matter of fact," interrupted the
conductor, "I've already chosen the pieces
we'll be singing, but I want to keep you in
suspense over the composers until we start
rehearsals."
"How many of our four suggestions did you
adopt?" the committee asked him.
"That I can't tell you without giving the game
away completely," replied the conductor with
a grin, " s o you'll have to work it out
yourselves."
Can you help them? Which composers will
feature in the next choir concert?
