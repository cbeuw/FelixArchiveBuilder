By the pond was a pump which had supplied
water .in a past age. But since the by-laws were
ratified, the municipal council had replaced the
old pump with pure running water. It stood
ignored, its day had not yet come. Fifty years
perhaps, people would see it and say: "Oh! The
village pump!" and gasp with delight.
Episode Four
Dreaming in her downy cot, Griselda, doe eyed,
wispy, delicious daughter of Farmer Puddle stirs
only slightly as another drip plops into the
water butt outside her window. For her age,
just fifteen, she is a comely lass and pure as the
driven snow. Many are the lustful eyes which
follow her bobbing and twitching course down
the high street. But her honour is preserved by
the thought of retribution form her draconian
father and the ploughboys thus hide their desire.
Sweet girl, she dreams mostly of sex.
