Guilds Rugby
GUILDS STRUGGLED from the start and fell
behind to an unconverted try when an
opposition player burst away from a maul to
score.
This setback seemed to spur the Guilds
pack, who started to supply the backs with
decent possession. Our first try was a
magnificent solo effort by a mystery RCS
winger when he outsprinted the UC defence
from the halfway line. Steve Bishop managed
to poach a try from a scrum on the line,
however both conversions were missed as
were a few penalties, making the half-time
score 8-4.
Early in the second half our outside half,
Clive, shocked us all by kicking a penalty. We
were even more shocked when they scored
a converted try a few minutes later.
This proved to be UC's last contribution to
the scoring, with Guilds proceeding to score
a further three tries, one of them converted.
The best of the tries was scored by Clive
following a dummy scissors move in the
backs, the other tries being scored by Bishop
and that mystery RCS winger.
Football Seconds
IC 2nds followed up their cup success on
Saturday with an emphatic 7-0 victory over
UC 3rds. A re-arranged midfield trio of
Wiggins, Veenman and Armstrong played
well, creating plenty of chances up front.
Particularly encouraging wasthe performance
of Wiggins, who linked effectively with
Saunders on the left side of the field. It was
Saunders who opened the scoring with a
firmly hit drive from just inside the box. Soon
after, a goalmouth scramble allowed Wiggins
to drive home his first goal for the 2nds.
By half-time, IC's lead had been extended
to 4-0 after a close range header from Carr
and a well taken goal from the edge of the
area by Veenman.
Some early second half UC pressure was
effectively dealt with and soon IC were back
in control of the match. Carr continued his
scoring success when his well-timed run left
him with only the keeper to beat. Veenman
then scored a similar goal to make the score
6-0.
Soon after, MacDonald was caught by a
late challenge and sadly had to leave the field
with a badly swollen ankle. A firm tackle by
Lakin, then resulted in a UC penalty, which
was considerately shot wide of the IC goal. A
good all-round performance was capped
when Saunders first-time swhot found the net.
TEAM: Veats, Curran, Beer, MacDonald,
Lakin, Armstrong, Wiggins, Veenman,
Walters, Carr, Saunders.

Football Thirds
ON an overcast Saturday afternoon, IC
started confidently against a LH team who
had strengthened their defence at the
prospect of meeting IC. After twenty minutes
Rimmer collected the ball forty yards out on
the right and beat four players before being
half-tackled in the penalty area. He soon,
regained possession and scored to finish a
fine individual effort. The second goal
followed when Wiggins, well out of position
on the right, passed to Esberger who slotted
the ball away confidently from just inside the
area.
Early in the second half the Hospital
realised they had a shortage of patients and
had heard enough Scouse for one day.
Wiggins was duly removed from the pitch
with an injured wrist (and knee). The Hospital
soon regretted this move when they heard
Healy approaching from the fifth team pitch.
Although IC played for some time with ten
men, the defence played well and the LH
attack rarely troubled goalkeeper Gilbert,
who made a confident third team debut. Late
in the second half Saunders provided an
excellent example of IC Seconds finishing
power when he headed high over the bar,
with only the keeper to beat.
T E A M : Gilbert, Curran, Redmayne,
Drabble, Gohil, Sims, Heady, Esberger,
Wiggins (Healy), Saunders, Rimmer.
Sailing
ON SATURDAY, the IC team were again at
the 'Harp' to sail a team from Southampton.
The wind was strong and this was possibly in
Southampton's favour, however their
familiarity with strong coastal breezes did not
stop them from retiring to the opposite end of
the reservoir to practice beating, thereby
delaying the start.
Conditions dictated that, just before the
race, the start must be altered and this was
badly communicated to the teams. Two
Southampton boats who had heard about the
alteration thus created such a lead that IC
were virtually left to fight amongst itself for
the third, fourth, and fifth positions in which
the team eventually finished.
The second race was somewhat similar,
with Southampton again going off to practice
beating, and thereby annoying the home
team, and when the race finally started, IC
succeeded little better than in the first.
While IC sailed badly and lacked experience
this should not detract from the victory of a
strong Southampton team.
T E A M : Murray, Kennedy, Chadwick,
Younghusband, Redman, Mills.

more films.

matches, all the details are on the Tennis
Club Noticeboard in the Sports Centre and
the weather won't be better.
Snooker
A TERRIBLE WEEK for the C team who
only managed to w i n one frame. Their
opponents, Charing Cross took four frames
out of the five, four more than they deserve.
The glorious B team had better fortune and
won 3-2 against QMC B team. Bennett played
wonderfully, so he tells me, and Holt won
again much to his own delight and our
amazement.
The A team didn't play last week because
there was no one to play.
The winnners of the 'Pot Luck Doubles'
were White and McCelland. The runners-up
gave a brave fight only to lose 3-0 in a final
worthy of its participants.
Phil Speaks
LAST Sunday I was fortunate enough to use
the New Volleyball Court. Not only was I
amazed at the disgustingly filthy state the
court was in, but surprised to find an
assortment of old mattresses strewn around.
The place needs a good, thorough clean out
(floor included) before permanent damage to
the new Â£7,000+ floor results. Or better still,
the introduction of a system of fines for users
failing to clean the place up!
