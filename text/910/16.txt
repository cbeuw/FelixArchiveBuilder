However, thanks to student or
'peer' tutoring, such problems have
been partially relieved, in local
schools, one day a week.
The idea is that an individual with
knowledge or a skill can pass it on
to others—without necessarily being
a teacher. T h e scheme was invented
in the late eighteenth century by
Joseph Lancaster when faced with
350 children to teach, single

Chris Riley
reports on his
second
childhood.
Jason was a tall, well built West
Indian sixteen year old, with a left
hook that would rival M i k e T y s o n
and a hair cut to match. Five years
ago, with adolescent peer pressure
to repel authority and education
mounting, he had been labelled a
'disruptive and difficult pupil'.
With the end of school days now in
sight, science classes just got in the
way o f his obsession with acid
house music and basketball. Science
was something for other people,
something he had never understood
and therefore hated. Brownian

basketball, and lots o f little guys are
running round bumping into y o u ,
trying to get the ball', I began.
'Okay man', he replied, beaming
down at me and then looking wildly
round the class in a bid to distract
others.
' N o w these little guys a r e
knocking you about'. I grabbed his
blazer and shook him violently. H e
stared at me in disbelief.
'Someone is watching this game
from above, and can only see y o u
moving about, because the little
guys are too small to see.'

experimental analogy hit its mark
and the jittering smoke particles,
abruptly changing direction took on
a p r e v i o u s l y u n d i s c o v e r e d
significance. It had taken the whole
forty minute lesson to get this far,
not including the previous weeks of
rejection, when I had failed to get
through.
T h e buzzer rang, and he was off
to the freedom o f the street again.
A s he left the classroom, he paused
and came back. 'Fanks mate', he
grinned, slapping the palms o f m y
hands. T h e weeks before, suddenly
all seemed worthwhile and I
returned the slap, with a 'see y o u

handedly at his Southwark school.
Rediscovered in the early 1960's to
meet teacher shortages i n
developing countries and inner
cities in the U S , it's supporters
claim there are significant benefits
for both tutors and pupils.
It was not until the mid-1970s that
the idea reached Britain. T h e
scheme was launched by D r Sinclair
Goodlad as a course project for
twelve engineering students at
Imperial College, to test whether
pupils at Pimlico School would find
lessons more interesting with their
help. Today, results still show that
well over half (63 %) o f pupils find
their lessons easier to follow and
nearly three quarters o f teachers
find lessons more enjoyable and
easier to handle. Almost all o f the
student tutors involved report an
increase in self confidence, feeling
that they have gained useful practice
in communication skills, and are
doing something useful with their
subject. 'Explaining an idea to a
nine year o l d offers a unique
experience o f c o m m u n i c a t i n g ,
w h i c h c a n be i n v a l u a b l e to
industry', expalins John Hughes,
former peer tutor and now B P
fellow in peer tutoring at Imperial.
T h e 'Pimlico Connection' was
established by Goodlad in 1975 and
five years later it became a U n i o n
Society, administered and run
largely by students.
Research shows that school pupils
find peer tutors a r e m o r e
approachable when they don't
understand things. ' A teacher can't
get a r o u n d the w h o l e class
sometimes but, with students there
you could get help more quickly',
explain Pimlico students, fifteen
years on.
Terry Barclay, teacher at the F o x
School in Holland Park, explains in
the Independent (26 July 1990) that
'the children see the tutors as real
scientists. They don't quite trust us
as scientists somehow.' Peer tutors
are often closer to the pupils age and
status, than they are to teachers, and
therefore act as role models for
children w h o , probably never
consider higher education. 'It is
especially good for girls to see
women science students', points out
John Mason of St. Clements and St.
Johns School, in L o n d o n . Beverly
