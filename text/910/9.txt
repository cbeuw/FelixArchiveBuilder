Felix 910
First Years' Introduction
So, having seen the handbook you'll
have read a little about all those
wonderful clubs and societies and
others. But don't just be led by mere
written words, go and meet the
people responsible.
O n Tuesday afternoon from
2.30pm onwards all the clubs and
societies will be displaying their
wares around college and the union
b u i l d i n g . C l u b s c a n n o t take
membership o n the day, though
they are allowed to sell goods from
their stalls. D o come and meet some
of those nice union officers at the
union stall (outside the union office)
or the sweet and cuddly Felix crew
in Beit Quad (by the student
magazine office).
m
T h e union officers will be
wearing 'Imperial College U n i o n '
badges throughout Freshers' Week.
Far from being for purely sartorial
elegance, this means you can stop
them and ask them any questions
you like.
If wandering around proves too
exciting for y o u , then y o u can
always retire to the lounge bar for
a drink and some food, which will
be open all afternoon.
