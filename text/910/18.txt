Unsporting Heseltine
and Hyde
Dear Editor
Re: Imperial (College) Sports
Centre.
I believe we should all be
c o n c e r n e d about recent
developments at the Sports Centre,
particularly the imposition o f
'admission' charges or compulsory
'membership' for college staff and
students (in addition to charges for
use o f the facilities). Perhaps this
is a case for a little investigative
reporting on what appears to be an
i n s i d i o u s i f not c o m p l e t e l y
clandestine privatisation o f the
Sports Centre and change o f its
prime use to that o f a commercial
health club.
Here is the sequence o f events so
far:
1. Disappearance o f the staff
student Sports C e n t r e U s e r s
Committee.
2. Introduction o f Membership
fees for outsiders, retirement o f the
college manager.
3. A w a r d o f a 'consulting
m a n a g e m e n t ' c o n t r a c t to
Wandsworth C o u n c i l to provide a
m a n a g e r a n d i m p r o v e the
profitability o f the Centre.
4. Increases in charges above
inflation rates, and promotion o f
activities o f special interest to
outsiders (slimming clubs etc). N e w
'uniforms' for staff.
5'. Introduction o f admission
charges or 'membership' fees for
college personnel and students (to
enter our o w n facility!). This was
a c c o m p a n i e d b y u n i l a t e r a l
cancellation o f staff Sports Centre
Membership cards by the manager.
(It was this action which provoked
m y interest).
Yve's
D e a r Adam,
I'd like to take an opportunity to
say a final farewell and thanks to
Imperial College and I C U n i o n .
Working for I C U has been a very
interesting and overall rewarding
experience. It was a challenge to set
up and run the Welfare Advisory
Service and a task I could not have
achieved without the help o f IC staff
(all), sabbaticals (most of) and
many college staff as well.
So thank you everyone for your
support over the last 23
A years and
to all those who contributed to m y
generous leaving gift. This I intend
6. Change of name from Imperial
College Sports Centre to Imperial
Sports Centre. (The manager makes
a real fuss about not mentioning the
w o r d ' c o l l e g e ' i n telephone
responses).
7. Closure o f the Centre for
several months next June to fit
sunbeds, saunas etc.
It now costs the same, pro-rata, to
play squash at the Imperial Sports
Centre as it does at any other club.
In other words the privatisation is
almost complete without anyone
making a fuss and a college facility
is effectively the same as a private
c l u b albeit w i t h v e r y l o w
subscriptions at present. C a n y o u
imagine what the membership fees
will be next year to pay the capital
costs o f the saunas, Jacuzzi and
sunbeds (They are £250 per year for
the ex-Wandsworth St George's
Centre and Wimbledon!).
T h e issues worth raising include:
W h o authorised cancellation o f
free staff and student college sports
centre membership cards?
Is it permissible to privatise a
facility built for I C students, and
paid for b y the University Grants
Committee (now U F C ) funds?
W h e n has there been a n y
consultation about these radical
changes?
I hope you and the U n i o n will be
able to take some action o n this
matter. It may already be too late
to do much to protect our Sports
Centre as a college facility.
Yours sincerely,
John McMahon Moore (Senior
Lecturer).
cc President I C U n i o n
Chairman I C A U T
Adieu
to use towards the cost o f a word
processor which I hope will help me
with all those essays and projects
I'll have to produce over the next
year!
Finally I'd like to wish all IC and
I C U staff, students and sabbatical
officers all the best for 1991/92
academic year. I hope that it proves
to be a successful and enjoyable
time for everyone and I look
forward to reading some interesting
editions o f F E L I X when I call by
to say hello.
Best wishes,
Yve Posner, ex Welfare Adviser.
Dear Adam,
In his speech in the House o f
C o m m o n s before the summer
recess, the Right H o n o u r a b l e
Michael Heseltine Secretary o f
State for the Environment finally
declared his intention to introduce
privatisation into H e r Majesty the
Queen's Royal Parks. W e are
assured that in spite of the imminent
redundancy o f 361 dedicated parks
staff, horticultural standards and
indeed all other standards will be
raised.
This should not prove too difficult
in the light o f their rapid decline
over the past ten years, the direct
result o f M r Heseltine's o w n
cabinet's ongoing policy in this area
of stringent financial cutbacks. T h e
ensuring insidious cull o f park staff
inevitably resulted in total failure to
maintain any acceptable standard in
the Central L o n d o n Parks, i.e. St
James, Regents, H y d e Parks and
Kensington Gardens.
In the same speech to the
Commons the Minister promises 'a
bright future' for our Royal Parks,
yet fails to mention existing plans
for a coach park in H y d e Park. H e
fails also to give his reasons for
discarding and disregarding the
conclusions arrived at by L o r d
Skelmersdale in his review o f the
R o y a l P a r k s i n 1 9 8 7 . L o r d
S k e l m e r s d a l e c o n c l u d e d that
nothing would be gained by their
privatisation.
Londoners, justifiably sceptical,
if not down right suspicious o f the
Minister's intentions and gravely
concerned about the future o f these
unique and very special open
spaces, are currently taking to the
streets and petitioning fellow
Londoners in a desperate bid, if not
to stop the proposed legislation, at
the very least to demand their
democratic right to a voice on this
issue. T h e response regardless o f
political persuasion is unanimously
against.
A s custodians o f the Royal Parks,
have we the right to leave a legacy
of car and coach parks and money
s p i n n i n g f o l l i e s to future
generations? Y o u r support would be
invaluable.
Join us, help us to protect our
Royal Parks.
Anna Green.
