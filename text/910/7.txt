Reading, a veritable mosquito bite
on the arse of the naked land, yet
again plays host to what is known,
cryptically enough, as the Reading
Festival. David and Seb discuss this
and the relative merits of drinking
until falling over in some dire bar.
Their conclusion? Read o n . . .
Friday.
Festival. What image does this
conjure up? T h i r t y thousand
pissheads believe it consists of a
weekend orgy of alcohol and sex.
It's not, but Reading always was
full of contradictions such as, say
'Carter' supported by 'the F a l l ' .
T r y a free festival and some brew
and you'll be amazed. N o more the
denizen of kids wearing Carter and
N e d ' s tee-shirts. N o more Goths
and all for free.
F r i d a y was a g o o d day.
Ominously grey clouds threatened
and occasionally pissed down on the
permanently pissed crowd, but the
bill was excellent. Noise god after
noise god, never was a better line-
up seen - except for the 'Honey
Thieves'. I've never heard or seen
the Honey Thieves and do not want
to talk about the bloody Honey
Thieves.
Not so the 'Babes'. A n ail-
American, all-girl trio who play a
bastard R o c k n ' R o l l seldom
bettered. They paled in the face of
the m i g h t y , m u c h m a l i g n e d
' S i l v e r f i s h ' . T h e i r r h y t h m i c ,
pulsating sound vibrates to your
very soul, truly, pop music to
brainwash to. Pure aural terror
faded as 'Nirvana' took over.
'Dinosaur J r ' . Line up, and be
buttfucked by J's Guitar. Another
disappointment. Fuzzy sound and a
shitty atmosphere ruined what could
have been. They still shred, cruising
through monolithic (Tut tut, Seb.
M i x e d metaphor) tracks like 'Freak
Scene' and ' T h e W a g o n ' .
After greatness, 'Pop W i l l Eat
Itself. Again, need I say more. The
only band on friday worse than
Iggy, and that alone speaks
nought but trouble. I would have
stayed were C a r t e r not so
unmentionably dire. Alright I had
a headache as well.
Sunday.
With ony a few baggy stragglers
left over, drunken, dazed and too
much out of their heads to be in y o '
face, Reading turned into a kind of
ghost camp that Goth has always
b e e n : r i d i c u l o u s and m i l d l y
third rate and little league. ' N e d ' s '
- ha! T h e final nail in the coffin o f
the unfunny joke bands. A n d that's
the funniest thing about them.
Expect a resurgence in the next ten
years, but if I want humour, I'll
listen to the 'Sisters'. O h Christ,
what a crap introduction...
Yes, yes I confess my reason for
buying the Reading ticket and yes,
the idea is incongruous. T h e purple
lights, the pea soup of dry ice, and
The Reading Festival
volumes.
T h e band that should have
headlined. 'Sonic Y o u t h ' . Sonic
Terrorism. F r o m sex kitten K i m ' s
crusty panties to Lee's screaming
guitar, Sonic Youth were awesome.
A n d Iggy couldn't top it.
Punk is dead and men like Iggy
Pop still try to animate it's rotten
corpse. It was an insult to anyone's
sensibilities. Pause, and examine
the comparative merits o f spending
the remaining hours watching Iggy
strut his funky shite, or getting
headfucked by a blazing fire.
Saturday.
C o n s i d e r y o u r c o n c e p t o f
Saturdays. A r e they comprised of
a headache, a field full of shit and
corpses, lots o f people wearing tee-
shirts screaming Y o u Fat Bastard,
and lots of, er, fat bastards? No? O h
I forgot shit music too. Except 'the
F a l l ' . If y o u didn't see this, y o u
should be kicking yourself, or at
M u c h touted and perhaps over-
rated, Nirvana were the darlings of
the Sub-pop scene. Patchy sound
ruined the day; see them in a small
venue or, better, buy a fuck off
stereo and their a l b u m s .
Fuck 'Chapterhouse'-indie shite -
nuff said.
least 'searching for the place where
:
t h e y make this brew'. 'Carter
U S M ' , or the C U S machine, as I
prefer to call them, are not worth
the time of day. Contrary to popular
opinion, I do not dislike 'James',
but the corruption of a good natured
pop band to major status speaks
ineffectual.
T h e 'Pooh-Sticks' were great.
Yeah, young people turn me on too.
T h e singer declares that we will
never see them again, before
launching into 'I'm In Y o u ' . A t this
point I leave the acoustic stage.
'Gang Starr' are on the main stage.
I walk away; what I don't need on
Sunday is the sort of lifeless wank
' D e L a S o u l ' brought to Reading
the day before. Luckily I meet up
with some friends and we have a
few beers. Jo Brand comes on in the
cabaret tent. Jo Brand's funny. In
the acoustic tent, the 'Fatima
Mansions' are playing. They win -
sorry Jo. So I wander to the tent for
'Ceausescu', ' V i v a Dead Ponies',
etcetera. They don't play ' O n l y
Losers take the B u s ' , bloody
shame, but Ceausescu is typically
violent. This man is very definitely
a main contender for the kingdom
of rock and roll. Cathal Coughlan
is a t h r i l l i n g n e c e s s a r y
commandment. His version of the
modern myth of society spat all
over Reading and the 'Blow Chunk'
attitudes of the other bands.
Speaking of which
Godfathers are crap. T h e y
capture the quintessential ethos of
all that's been shit this weekend -
food, tee-shirts, flat beer, Saturday.
This is not sensitive or clever: it is
the throb of 'After H o u r s ' that
worked so well in Leeds earlier this
year translated to the massive open
stage and the sceptical square mile
of audience.
Eldritch wanders to his mike
stand as the speed driven bars of
'First and Last and A l w a y s ' echo.
H e ' s wearing a tuxedo and bow tie.
I spent the entire weekend getting
shit faced to the point of inanity,
and this was the first time I desired
sobriety. G r u n g y b l a c k - a r s e d
Reading, gorgeously and ironically
confronted by a man in a tuxedo.
T w o songs in, he greets the
audience. It's 'Someday, everything
you need is just gonna fall from the
skies'. ' D o m i n i o n ' interrupts the
confused Goths train of thought and
I laugh and pray for another nuclear
accident. T h e bitch is, they close
too early. His encore is for George
B u s h - ' H e ' s got T o m a h a w k
missiles in his hands, he's got the
whole fucking world in his hands'.
A s the self-styled, self-emasculated
pale emperor bellows out his
thanks, the darkness closes around
the cheerfully unhappy Goths and
I wander back to the station, drunk
and dirty, and considering what a
generally wanky weekend it's been.
Yeah, I know festivals are crap. See
you next year.
