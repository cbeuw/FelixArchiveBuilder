Dear Fresher,
Welcome to Imperial College.
The next three or four years should
be among the most interesting and
enjoyable in your life, provided you
make the most of the opportunities
available at university. This open
letter aims to give you some ideas
for your own self-development.
Y o u can probably recall one of
the significant steps in your life
when you entered the sixth form or
went to sixth form college. C o m i n g
to university is an even more
significant step. Y o u have more
freedom, more independence and
more opportunities to do your own
thing and to succeed or fail. If you
do not make some mistakes you will
not have learnt anything, learning
from one's own mistakes is an
important part of experience, but
don't waste time re-inventing
everything—build on the experience
of others—take advice (it's usually
free)—ignore some of it, test it out,
accept or reject it.
Y o u have already demonstrated
some planning ability by passing
' A ' levels—or their equivalent—
sufficiently well to be at College.
H o w are you going to plan the next
three, four or six years? A n d I'm
not talking just about your academic
studies, I'm talking about the start
of the rest of your life. Setting
objectives some people call it.
If your short-term objective is to
do as little work as possible and
your medium-term objective is to
scrape a pass, and your long-term
objective is to be idle and poor, then
there is no conflict. But if you have
grander long-term objectives you
will have to modify your short and
medium-term objectives.
By the end of the summer term
in your first year you may be feeling
the financial pressures—in other
words you're probably broke! So
how about earning some good
money in the long vacation? If you
leave job hunting until the vacation
starts you may be too late. A l l the
interesting and lucrative jobs have
been filled already and you will be
lucky if the local council wants
some grass cutting or the garden
centre needs a dirty pair of hands.
It's well worthwhile doing some
preliminary job hunting between
Christmas and Easter. Call in at the
I C Careers A d v i s o r y S e r v i c e
(Room 310, Sherfield Building)
where you will find information
about Vacation Training, write to
employers with your C V , call in to
some local shops and hotels and see
who's advertising in the local press.
Vacation jobs can be most
informative. Ideally they give you
an insight into the type of work you
may be interested in when you leave
college. They give you experience
in job hunting, letter writing and
interviews, as well as a real insight
into what it's like to work for a
particular type of employer. Some
even pay you quite well. Jobs
abroad are popular and early
applications are essential. Start by
visiting the IC Careers Advisory
Service which has a good range of
reference books and addresses.
A t the start of the second year you
raise your sights higher. Now is the
time to test your skills in organising
something—a social evening for
your department, looking after the
finances of a society or fixtures
secretary of your team. That sounds
too much like hard work, I hear you
say. Yes, it does take some effort
on your part but generally speaking
the more effort you put into
something the more enjoyment you
will get out of it.
Committee work is excellent
preparation for life after College.
Y o u learn to set agendas, run
meetings, agree actions, persuade
other students to do things, work
within budgets and end up with a
successful event—a party, a visit,
a play or a newspaper.
Y o u s h o u l d start t h i n k i n g
seriously about your future career
before the end of the second year.
Even if you haven't a clue what you
want to do, that's no excuse for
delaying finding out about the
possibilities. Y o u are surrounded
with sources of i n f o r m a t i o n -
friends, family, tutors, careers
advisers, libraries. Start looking. It
may be a long process but so is life,
so it really is worth spending more
time thinking about your career than
planning your next weekend or
holiday.
The IC Careers Advisory Service
is a good starting place. Pop in and
speak to the information officer.
Find out about 'Gradscope' and all
the information booklets and
reference files. Have a look at some
of the videos, attend some seminars
on careers, get yourself sorted out.
Christmas vacation courses are a
popular way of finding out about
careers such as marketing, but only
a few major recruiters run them and
they are normally over-subscribed
many times. T h e Careers Research
Advisory Centre ( C R A C ) runs a
series of 'Insight Into Management'
courses which are also a popular
w a y o f f i n d i n g out about
management careers.
Stop! I'm only a fresher—why
are you telling me all this?
I'm telling you because you need
to start planning your life now,
don't just drift through College and
emerge with a degree and nothing
else. O f course a degree is
important and must be your first
priority, but not your only priority.
In the meantime, enjoy yourself.
J o h n S i m p s o n .
Last year the college administration
had another of its periodic binges
o f cost-cutting.' A s ever, the
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n started on
unnecessary fripperies such as
student, facilities, streamlining
college expenditure to the barest
minimum, namely the generous
salaries awarded to the ranks of
faceless bureaucrats for w h o m the
college exists. One of the facilities
put under the sword was the
Careers Advisory Service ( C A S ) .
There was a struggle from which
the C A S emerged shaken, though
not severely damaged, except that
the C A S was to disaffiliate from the
University of L o n d o n C A S -
U L C A S . This meant that D r Russ
Clark, the then Director of the
service, who was provided by
U L C A S , had to leave.
But if we had not lost D r Clark,
we would not have gained M r John
Simpson, who became the director
of I C C A S earlier this summer.
John Simpson joined ICI in
Teesside as a student engineer - an
apprentice - straight from school. In
1959 he started a degree course in
Mechanical Engineering at Imperial
College, graduating in 1962. H e
then returned to ICI at Teesside to
manage a chemical plant. In 1967
he m o v e d to ICI L o n d o n
headquarters at Millbank for three
years, working in personnel, and
then another six years in Teesside
working with white collar unions.
He spent three years with ICI in
B r u s s e l s , t r a v e l l i n g w i d e l y ,
w o r k i n g with expatriates and
working on salary surveys - that is
the comparison of salaries to
r a t i o n a l i s e w a g e levels for
employees. In 1979 he returned to
M i l l b a n k , L o n d o n as an ICI
graduate recruitment manager.
'I've been a bit of a corporation
gipsy', he told Felix, '...but I've
always taken a very close interest
in career's work'. H e was on the
career's advisory board of Sussex
University for six years, on the
U L C A S board for two and the
R O G E T advisory board for five.
A s John Simpson had been
working with ICI for 32 years,
Felix asked him why he had decided
to leave. After a pause for thought
he replied - 'I'd always anticipated
that by my early fifties I'd want to
do something different. What I want
to do is w o r k in c a r e e r ' s
advice I am delighted to be
here, I've been made to feel very
w e l c o m e , the environment is
pleasant and the job has proven to
be what I hoped it would'.
H e told Felix that the present
I C C A S was 'very well set up and
organised.... the information is first
class .... there is the right balance
of experience amongst the staff.
K e n Wiltsher joined I C C A S with
John Simpson.from ICI - he has
been seconded on a full time basis
until he finds another job. The team
also includes Frances M c E w e n ,
who has come from working at the
Polytechnic of Central London C A S
and who worked at I C C A S a couple
o f years ago, T o n y Daly, the new
information officer who joined
I C C A S in July, and Paula Cullens,
the information assistant who has
come from Keele University. The
graduate recruitment officer, Tracy
Carter, provides continuity with the
previous team and Bill Fox, another
secondee, works at I C C A S for two
days a week. John Simpson said that
there were no plans to expand the
service further though replacements
for K e n Wiltsher or Bill Fox will
be found when either leave.
Concluding the interview, M r
Simpson said 'the job market in
1991 has fewer vacancies and less
r e c r u i t m e n t a d v e r t i s i n g . J o b
vacancies are down by 2 0 % and
1992 will be equally difficult if not
worse. M y strong advice is to start
looking early - to use the Careers
Advisory Service If there is one
message I want to get across that is
to apply early. Y o u might get a job
as Imperial has a good reputation -
but the popular jobs will be gone by
Easter.'
