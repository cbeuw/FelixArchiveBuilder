What follows is a reasonably
accurate account of a boy's own
adventure. Disconcerted and bereft
of any desirable challenge, our
intrepid (and imaginative) writer
sought that most rare and awesome
creature, rock's most potent siren
and the current darling of the music
press. Sonic Euph talks to Cranes'
Alison Shaw.
It does occur to me, though, that
however much you try to appear
o r d i n a r y , y o u r m u s i c p o i n t s
towards an isolationist stance.
' H o w do you mean?' A w k w a r d
silence.
E r , it's not terribly approachable
music. It's oppressive.
' M a y b e , but, we are reasonably
normal people'.
But you have said of your music
that it may seem dark, but there's
I preferred 'Tender Prey'. ' T h e
M e r c y Seat' is one of m y personal
favourites.
' Y e s , but I like the fact that H e
uses strings and piano on ' T h e
G o o d S o n " . - 1 '
I agree. It adds a new dimension
to his music, but I can still go back
and lose myself in 'Junkyard'.
T h e word ' Y e a h ! ' right now
sounds like I've found a kindred
spirit - but...
The Cranes Interview
Surprise of this particular week
N o . 1. Guns 'n' Roses get Single
of the W e e k in M e l o d y Maker.
Surprise No. 2. Cranes don't. This
is the same music press that
regularly attempts to convince us
that Levitation are more of a
household name than, say, Right
Said Fred (gay bouncers are a big
topic down our way, I can tell you).
It never ceases to amaze me that
idolatrous and gushing prose is
written by people whose only aim
seems to be caging Cranes under a
ridiculously small name. I suppose
we're all guilty of it from time to
time, but fingers seem to point
constantly at them, in unison with
cries of Bauhaus, Cocteaus, My
Bloody Valentine, et cetera ad
i n f i n i t u m . W h a t e v e r the
implications, they're keeping the
truth to themselves. A r e they
operating a master plan? strategic
concessions to the press and,
thereby, the public?
' N o . I mean, W e signed to
Dedicated in M a r c h last year, did
Tnescapable'that summer, toured
Holland; Dedicated wanted an L . P .
before Christmas, but we said we
couldn't do it. W e started making
the L . P . this summer'.
I have to confess that it seems
improbable that Y o u would produce
a long-form video; though quite
distinct from my perception of you,
it feels too soon.
' W e l l , it's not really. T h e video
contains four promos, some footage
from ' S N U B ' , and a home movie'.
F a i r enough, I think. That
answers that one. D o I venture for
a big ice- breaker? The trouble with
'phones is... they're 'phones.
A m e r i c a loves 'em. They won't
love Cranes, though. So, how does
A l i s o n react to the purple prose of
our lovely music press?
T don't understand it'.
M m m m . It gushes. It's over the
top.
' Y e a h , I don't like-'
( E D I T E D I N T E R J E C T I O N )
' H a ha. Y o u ' l l never get M e to
say that. N o , I can't relate it to what
we do'.
always a light at, ahem, the end of
the tunnel; I don't get that, I don't
experience that with your music.
O h dear. Laughter. I laugh back.
What?
' W e l l , you don't sound like a
Cranes fan. D o n ' t you like us?'
N o , no, I assure her. I love your
Right. Lesson for today. H o w to
break a newly- established affinity
with a R o c k Star. A s k a question
with the word ' G o t h ' in it.
H o w do you react when the name
' G o t h ' is fired at you?
T don't know; I mean, what most
people think of when they hear
music. I think you're the most
original 'band' around. Cranes are
great. Readers, I mean that most
sincerely. Cranes are gorgeous.
O . K . , so there is a certain extent
with 'Adoration' with the major
chords three minutes through the
song, but the main reason is your
voice.
'Thank you. It's nice of you to
say it'.
I'm charmed. I mean it. Now I've
alluded to it, how do I avoid that
question? I don't. Where does the
voice come from, by the way? I
mean, it's described here as 'foetal
keening'(promotional notes to you
lot).
' O h god, P . R . O . D . . It's just my
voice, y'know. A l l that 'child-like'
stuff is just irritating'.
T h e problem is, it can't be
denied. She sounds so affected in
the songs. I make a discreet move
towards the pigeonhole marked
'another tack'. It seems to me that
most of the bullshit said about
Cranes revolves around their
presumed antecedents - Swans, The
Birthday Party, Bauhausl I don't
know where they get Bauhaus
from.
' W e l l , I used to listen to The
Birthday Party, but not any more'.
Y o u still like Nick Cave, though.
' O h , I liked ' T h e G o o d S o n " .
' G o t h ' is the M i s s i o n and the
Nephs, and to M e that's more like
heavy rock'.
Mmrp,, T h e Sisters. It's merely
another name for heavy metal. It
used to mean The Birthday Party,
Joy Division, U.K. Decay, even
Diamanda Galas. These, and their
descendants, are collectively known
as the avant-garde. Diamanda's
another o f your comparisons.
Diamanda Galas and L y d i a L u n c h ,
by association, seem to have
p r o v o k e d a line o f i n q u i r y
c o n c e r n i n g y o u r past, and
childhood traumas.
T don't wish to discuss it, but it
was relatively normal'.
Yes. It's more of a case of a
personal response to something,
because it is nothing unless it affects
something. E v e n so, this question
has accused your fans of a sadistic
voyeurism because of the presumed
nature of the music.
'Well, any listener is a voyeur of
sorts. It all depends on your
approach'. This is undeniable.
A l s o , I have been given, on
occasion, to sadistic thoughts when
listening to music. All About Eve,
for instance, or Tanita Tikaram. M y
sadism as regards Alison, I'm given
to understand, is through m y
interest in her failed catharsis and
the necessary self-inflicted pain of
the failure. A g a i n , the voice of
Alison Shaw is held to be a catalyst
for the protective instincts of men.
What I think, however, is that this
particular instinct is merely a 'sub-
heading', so to speak. But this isn't
up for debate. Not on the 'phone on
a monday afternoon, anyway.
Shit. I hate 'phones. This is my
first ' p h o n e i n t e r v i e w . A n d
probably my last.
'It's O . K . . It's like a chat'.
But it's so much better one-to-
one. I suppose Y o u must be really
puritanical with your product,
musical dictatorships and all that.
' T o an extent. J i m writes all the
music, but it's very much a gut
reaction thing'.
Originality without contrivance.
A s l i p p e r y b a s t a r d , but
'Adorations/Brighter' had a very
spontaneous feel.
' T h e first v o c a l take for
'Adoration' was the one we used.
It's mostly like, I hear the music,
and sing whatever words come into
my head'.
Gloriously honest. Fantastically
natural. Almost auto-suggestion,
but with distinct personalities. E v e n
so, 'Adoration' feels slightly more
contrived than 'Fuse or 'Self N o n -
S e l f (both recorded on 8-Track in
1986). T h e transience of Cranes'
sound, a very definite thing, is not
gazing at it's own future. Her voice
was more raw in 1986, but this is
not base camp, if y o u ' l l pardon the
pun.
' W h e n we first started, we used
to bash around in a garage, and you
had to scream to be heard - but I
couldn't say where we're going...'
There is, it seems, some slight
truth in the inspiration through
adversity with Cranes. Their home
town, Portsmouth, they found
parochial and claustrophobic. They
were the classic struggling artists;
poverty has often invoked great
inspiration. So, has their fame
brought that sterile kind of wealth
their way?
' N o . W e ' r e still poor. I only get
£60 per week'.
O h dear. Evidently, Y o u ' r e not
selling enough records. I feel
responsible; I shall therefore extol
Y o u r virtues to the record-buying
public.
' O h , please!'
Cranes are like the favourite toy
for our music press. It's the one
they're never allowed to play with.
They beg, whine and sulk; but if
they got their hands on it, they
would break it and throw it back.
Cranes' album, 'Wings O f J o y ' ,
is out now on Dedicated, and
Cranes play L o n d o n U . L . U . on
October 11th. C o m e and spend a
day in Alison's house.
