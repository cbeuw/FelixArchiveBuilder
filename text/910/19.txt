Welcome to Imperial College! T h e
first weeks at this college for both
undergraduates and postgraduates
tend to become a homogenous
sweaty amalgam o f discovery and
mistakes. Still, enjoy the novelty
while you can, and ensure that you
don't waste the future years here
merely working for your degree or
P h D or whatever.
The Student Union
The college's Student U n i o n is an
organisation geared towards student
welfare. It is a service which exists
to help you, but can only do this i f
you ask o f it, as nobody who works
there is capable o f telepathy. T h e
U n i o n is not a trade union, it has
no political affiliation, either to the
right or the left. Imperial College's
Student U n i o n is not a member o f
the N U S - the National U n i o n o f
Students, an issue which will almost
certainly be more fully aired in the
future. The point about this diatribe
is to emphasise that the U n i o n is
there for you, and it should not be
avoided because you have a vague
suspicion that it is a hotbed o f
radical politics, the slimy tentacles
of which will never relinquish their
hold, because it's not and it won't.
A v o i d i n g an organisation which
could help y o u because o f the
possibility that something you may
dissapprove o f may have occurred
once is plainly stupid.
The Union is also responsible for
the running o f the snack bar (also
variously termed the union cafe,
caterpillar cafe or lounge bar), the
U n i o n B a r , the organisation o f
entertainment and a number of day
to day activities all o f which benefit
students, many o f w h o m are
unaware of the contribution that the
Union makes. I have met many
students w h o have c o n v i n c e d
themselves that they have led a life
totally untainted by the union, even
though they have eaten food from
the bar and read this student union
newspaper.
Felix - the student newspaper
Felix is the name o f the college
newspaper. It is technically the
Student U n i o n newspaper, but its
scope is by no means limited to
union affairs and nor is it beholden
to the U n i o n Office as to what is
printed. It is an independent
commentator on the college, and
reports on national and international
matters relevant to I C students.
The only people it is beholden to
are the students o f Imperial. Felix
has a sabbatical editor - me, A d a m
H a r r i n g t o n - a n d t w o other
permanent members of staff. There
is no conceivable way that these
three could research, write, typeset,
proof, paste up a n d print a
reasonably sized Felix every week
and depends entirely o n student
input to run. W e are on the map -
in the central pages - come and see
us. It is infinitely the most
fascinating part of the college, if not
the entire galaxy. It is not a club,
it is not a clique, there are no
peculiar entry rituals.
Deadlines
I hereby give general notice that the
deadlines for features, letters,
what's o n bits, small ads o r
anything else is 12.00 midday the
M O N D A Y before the Friday that
Felix comes out on. F o r example,
if y o u hand in an article on
Thursday, it will get into Felix not
that week, but the week following.
If y o u hand it in on Friday or
Monday, it will get into the Felix
of the following Friday. If the
deadline is not kept to, I will not
give any guarantee o f inclusion
irrespective o f how urgent it is.
What's On
I haven't included a comprehensive
what's on page in this issue. C o u l d
clubs and societies please put
relevant information into the clubs
and societies p i g e o n h o l e f o r
inclusion in the what's o n guide.
Bear in mind the deadlines given
above. Next week I intend to
p u b l i s h a l l the w h a t ' s o n
information at my disposal - please
don't hesitate to inform me o f any
errors or omissions.
