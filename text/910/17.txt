T h e main objective o f science
tutoring is not necessarily to recruit
more teachers, although this is
frequently a side effect. 'Most
tutors are not thinking o f becoming
teachers when they take part. But
there is evidence that for every one
w h o is put o f f , t w o are
e n c o u r a g e d ' , e x p l a i n s J o h n
Hughes.
The scheme is designed as more
of a promotion o f science and
technology. O n e o f the difficulties
facing industry at the moment is the
small proportion (50%) o f school
children who opt to continue their
education past 16, particularly in
science subjects. B P , convinced that
peer tutoring is a solution, began
sponsoring a new fellowship at
Imperial College in October 1990.
John Hughes, a former peer tutor
and teacher for ten years, was
appointed to develop the tutoring
scheme, in science and maths,
around the country.
Today, peer tuition is widespread
around the United States, and
thanks to B P , is spreading rapidly
in Britain. Imperial has helped over
fifteen third level institutions,
including Cambridge, Warwick
University and Nottingham and
Brighton Polytechnics, University
o f East Anglia, Trinity College,
Dublin, and University College
L o n d o n , to set up their o w n
schemes.
Students volunteering at the start
of the Autumn term usually visit the
school they have been assigned to
on Wednesday afternoons, during
term time, until M a r c h . Most tutors
have a one day training session at
college, at the beginning o f the
academic year. It is not a case o f
being thrown ' i n at the deep e n d ' ;
tutoring does not involve looking
after a class o f 20-30 kids, single
handedly. T h e desired effect is the
opposite; providing extra help
within a class. Such help is given
by working with small groups o f
children, under the direction and
supervision o f the class teacher,
who is still legally responsible for
the welfare of the pupils. Individual
work with gifted, remedial, or
d i s r u p t i v e p u p i l s , leaves the
teachers free to help others. Roger
Nicholls, head o f maths at Pimlico
School, again in the Independent,
admits that 'one afternoon a week
we actually get the number of pupils
to teachers right. Really we need
help like this all the time. A t the
moment it's a luxury, but it
shouldn't b e . '
Under the guidance o f John
Hughes, I C ' s Pimlico Connection
sent just under one hundred students
a week to primary and secondary
schools around the capital last year.
A t the end o f last term, tutors and
pupils alike were asked to fill in
questionnaires.
ShaShika, age nine, from T h e
F o x P r i m a r y S c h o o l , writes;
'students have not only helped m e
but they have helped the whole
class. They understand how we feel
so i f w e d o n ' t u n d e r s t a n d
something, they repeat what they
had said. They explain things very
clearly and they give joy to us just
to listen to them.' Rachel Hopping,
from the same school, writes; 'the
students knew exactly how we took
things i n , because they had been
children, not too long ago. They
knew the words that were easy for
us to understand and they used
them, (which sometimes teachers
forget).' A s i m writes; T wish they
would stay and teach us more about
science and I would like to say that
I really enjoyed it and think they
should be paid like teachers.'
S a a d i A s m i , a t h i r d y e a r
Chemistry undergraduate writes; T
started on the Pimlico Connection
Scheme in m y final year at
Imperial—and regretted not having
done so any earlier. It was one o f
the most enjoyable times I have had
at college.'
So whether, a budding teacher, a
future captain o f industry or
undecided, the Pimlico Connection
is for you. It only requires one or
two hours a week o f your time,
between October and March. Come
