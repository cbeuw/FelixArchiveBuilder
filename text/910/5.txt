Welcome back (or to those who are
new...welcome) to I C for yet
another exciting term filled with
fun, frolics, joy and laughter, all
provided to you by your friendly,
caring, sharing U n i o n . I hope you
had a great holiday, as I didn't! O h
well, a president's life is a lonely
o n e . . . b o o h o o . N o w , d o w n to
business.
Union Office
Those of you who have been used
to slouching around the dingy
brown U n i o n office in the North
East corner of Beit Quad will be
surprised to find that it is no longer
there. It has miraculously moved to
the central staircase and is now
bright and welcoming with a
comfortable reception area for you
to sit i n , drink coffee, read
newspapers, or one of the many
welfare information leaflets which
have now been placed there, or
even talk to Michelle or Cathy (the
very friendly administrative staff).
Should you wish to speak to any of
the sabbaticals then y o u need only
ask Michelle or Cathy to let you
through the gate and we'll be very
pleased to see you.
Welfare Service
Elsewhere in this issue you will
have seen that we have a new
welfare adviser: Stefano Ruis joined
us at the beginning of September
and has lots of new ideas (including
new longer opening hours!) to
improve the service provided. If
you have any questions about
welfare then come into the office
and either pick up a leaflet or speak
to Stef, he's very approachable and
is a 'very, very nice m a n ' .
Stefano Ruis is
the Union's new
Welfare Advisor.
External Affairs
Lots of things have happened over
the past year to make life for
students that little bit harder. Firstly
the grant has been frozen to make
way for the student loan, secondly
all student benefits have been
stopped. In order to register the
student opinion of these changes,
the University of London Union has
organised a Hallowe'en sleepout on
(you guessed it!) Hallowe'en. There
will be more info nearer the date,
but if you have suffered over this
summer then it is well worth getting
involved to prevent other students
from suffering the same fate.
Welfare
For too long, student welfare issues
have been ignored at IC. Hopefully
this won't happen this year. There
are two main avenues for Welfare
concern:
1. Educating and Informing
2. Campaigning for better services
T h e first is to be tackled by a series
of Welfare campaigns on specific
issues. T h e first of these will be a
general Educational Welfare W e e k
planned to introduce new students
to Health and Welfare issues that
should concern them (such as
F i t n e s s , E a t i n g , H e a l t h a n d
Finance). This is to take place over
the 5th week of term (so long away,
you say!). So it gives you a chance
to learn lots of bad habits before
spanking you and teaching you how
to do it right!
positions, write a manifesto quick!
I realise that there are already some
structures in existance within
departments and we would rather
tap into those structures than ignore
them.
Parking Permits
Application forms are now available
for students wishing to apply for a
parking place on campus. I must
warn y o u that competition is
high—there are only 100 permits to
give out and they are distributed on
a means tested basis so if you live
within 30 minutes journey of
college and have no special
circumstances then you are not
likely to get one so don't bother
applying. Y o u can pick up your
form from the U n i o n Office and
they are due in by 5pm Friday 12th
October.
News from the Home Front
Zoe Hellinger,
ICU President,
tries valiantly to
sound
interesting.
Read for
yourself
The second can only happen if the
U n i o n is informed of matters which
should be tackled. If you have any
worries about how you are treated
whilst at college then I need to know
in order to do anything about it.
This can be done either via a U n i o n
General Meeting ( U G M ) or by
talking to any of the sabbaticals
personally.
Postgraduates
A series of special interest lectures
have been a r r a n g e d for
postgraduates, the first of which
tackles ' H o w to choose a P h D ,
subject' and will be publicised
around departments closer to the
date. There will also be a meeting
held in each department at the
beginning of term to which all
postgraduates are invited, to begin
setting up a support and social
network within college. A t these
m e e t i n g s we w i l l elect a
'Departmental Representative' who
will be responsible for collecting
and disseminating information
within the department. So if you are
interested in holding one of these
Finally
If you care about the quality of your
life whilst you're here at I C then it
is y o u r responsibility to get
involved in the U n i o n . Joining
clubs, using the U n i o n facilities
( B a r , S n a c k B a r , D i s c o s ,
Bookstore, Welfare Advice) is a
major part of the involvement
necessary to have a happy life here
and to improve your employment
prospects, it is also virtually
impossible to avoid using these
facilities which the U n i o n provides
for y o u . Another method is by
becoming interested in how it is
run, whether the sabbaticals are
doing their jobs effectively, whether
important things are being missed,
whether students are being treated
fairly. If you aren't interested then
it is your own fault if you get a bad
deal in life.
That's the rant over with, there'll
be plenty more where that came
from as the year progresses...All
I'd like to do now is wish everyone
a great;. ,;ar at college and hope that
you all make the most of it.
