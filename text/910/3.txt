Private Parks
In future years, Imperial College
students may have to pay to enter
Hyde park. This possibility follows
the decision by M r . M i c h a e l
Heseltine, Secretary of State for the
Environment, to privatise the
maintenance of the eight Royal
Parks. Those against this move
believe that it may be part of a
larger strategy to put the control of
all Royal Parks solely into the
private sector. A m o n g s t the
protestors are the Transport and
General Workers U n i o n , to which
the parks' current employees
belong.
O n Tuesday 17th September,
campaigners rallied in Holland Park
at the opening of the Japanese
Gardens by Prince Charles. Police
presence was heavy and complaints
w e r e l e v i e d against p o l i c e
behaviour, saying that they had
been 'bullying' anybody obviously
connected with park preservation.
M e a n w h i l e the c a m p a i g n
continues and the wheels o f
government continue to turn. Those
wishing to take action should write
to their M P , or the Prime Minister.

Gardens, in Holland Park, now privately
maintained.

Evacuation of
Mech Eng after
Hydrogen Sulphide
Gas Alert
M e c h a n i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g was
evacuated at 5.15pm on Thursday
after dangerous levels of hydrogen
s u l p h i d e w e r e a c c i d e n t a l l y
produced in the building's drainage
system.
A drain had become blocked on
Level 1 and a private drain cleaner
company had been called in. A
company employee attempted to
unblock the drain by pouring 93 %
sulphuric acid down it. T h e gas
reacted with a mystery material in
the drain and copious amounts of
hydrogen sulphide filled the room.
A c c o r d i n g to Ian Gillett, of the
college safety unit, low levels of the
gas are not dangerous but it
desensitizes the nervous system so
that when levels do become toxic
there is a danger that they are not
noticed. T h e gas is therefore
dangerous, and since in this case it
originated from the drains system,
the entire building had to be
i m m e d i a t e l y e v a c u a t e d . T h e
building remained empty for eight
hours until the gas levels subsided.
New Bookstore
Manager
Imperial College U n i o n Bookstore
has a new m a n a g e r . N e i l
McCluskey left earlier this summer
and has been replaced by Jill
Gibbons. M s Gibbons left working
for Marks and Spencers 18 months
ago to go around the world.
'I didn't want to work in a big
organisation', she said, T wanted to
be in charge of making a go of
something.'
Music Library
Reorganisation
— New Assistant
The Haldane library will have a part
time music assistant to replace Chris
Gutkind who left at the end of July.
Janet Smith, Haldane librarian, told
Felix that the Management and
Planning group of the College
Administration had initially refused
to replace the music assistant, but
after an appeal by M r s Czigany, the
college l i b r a r i a n , the college
decided to compromise.
In addition to a half time music
assistant, the college will pay for a
new security system for the music
library. M u s i c will be issued from
the ground floor reception desk,
while the Haldane entrance will be
permanently closed.
There are plans to move the entire
Haldane library stock to the ground
floor 'at some point during this
academic year', which will cause
disruption for a while. F o r the short
term, the Haldane music library will
endeavour to keep to the present
opening hours.
Students Charged
for Linen
H o m e students will no longer be
provided with free linen when they
arrive at c o l l e g e residences.
Housekeepers have been instructed
by c o l l e g e a c c o m m o d a t i o n
management to offer linen packs for
sale to students. The original policy
included overseas students but it has
been amended after student union
intervention.
The linen packs contain two
sheets, two pillow cases, a blanket
and a bed cover. Most packs have
been made up from the old linen,
common to all halls of residence.
A c c o r d i n g to M s Gaskin, the
Garden Hall housekeeper, students
rarely used the blankets that were
once provided as many people
arrived with their own duvets. 'If
they turn up with nothing they will
be able to buy something,' she said.
