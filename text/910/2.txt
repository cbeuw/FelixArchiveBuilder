Daylight Robbery ^ m ?
Twelve thousand pounds worth o f
equipment were stolen in one
evening from college premises
during the summer. T h e theft in
August was particularly blatant; two
computers, an oscilloscope and
several charge amplifiers were
taken from a single room in the
C i v i l Engineering department.
According to college security
there were no signs of a break-in on
the digitally locked door. T h e theft
can be timed to at least the nearest
half hour, as a printer on a recurring
twenty minute cycle produced a
10pm readout but not a 10.20 one.
A college security spokesman said
that up to thirty-seven people knew
the lock combination and stated 'a
more selective access system is
required.'
The civil engineering theft was
not an isolated incident. Late in
August a computer was stolen from
the Bessemer Building, in addition
there have been numerous wallet
thefts during the summer vacation
and several answer machines have
gone missing.
C o l l e g e s e c u r i t y are also
concerned about the ease of access
to some college residences. Head of
security, Terry Briley, recommends
that students get to know as many
people in their hall as possible and
that they challenge any strangers on
sight.
Student Hardship
Fifty percent rise in students seeking help over summer
Students have experienced greater
hardship this summer than in
previous years according to figures
compiled by the U n i o n Welfare
office. A n example includes the
n u m b e r o f students s e e k i n g
financial assistance which trebled in
July and September compared to the
same time last year. A c c o r d i n g to
Stefano Ruis, who took up the post
of Welfare Officer at the beginning
of September, there has been a fifty
percent rise in the total number o f
students seeking help over the
summer months.
T h e problems facing many
students were firmly rooted in
f i n a n c i a l i n s e c u r i t y . ' T h e
withdrawal o f housing benefit
meant students lost a lot of help they
would otherwise have had,' he said.
H e is very concerned that once
money required for such necessities
as food, rent, books, bills, poll tax
and so forth are set aside from the
standard grant, there is a very
considerable shortfall. ' T h e so-
called compensation for the loss of
housing benefit (ie student loans)
does not really address the issue,'
claims Stefano. H e advises students
to 'budget unless they're going to
get into serious debt.'
F o r those that are already in
financial difficulties or who think
that they soon will be, Stefano can
arrange debt counselling and can
even help negotiate with creditors.
This was a service that was run by
his predecessor, Y v e Posner, and
one that he hopes to continue.
Stefano is concerned that worries
over money will affect not just
students academic performance but
also their emotional well being,
'Debt always does' he added.
According to as yet unpublished
government figures that have been
made available to Felix staff, which
include the administration costs o f
the student loan scheme, the
government is making as much as
a fifty percent saving by abolishing
housing benefit and holiday income
support for students. T h e
government appear to be expecting
students to pick up the tab in the
form o f large overdrafts. Â£3,000
debts are not unheard of amongst
third year students at Imperial.
Stefano fears that current student
financing will 'discourage students
from poorer families from going
into higher education unless they
are prepared to be saddled with
large overdrafts.'
During the summer a previously
unknown Imperial College based
group called 'Academics F o r Free
Speech', ( A F F S ) produced a four
page A 5 leaflet concerning the gas
c h a m b e r s at A u s c h w i t z a n d
Majdanek, used to exterminate 6
million Jews during the Second
World War. T h e anti-semitic nature
of the material roused concern
throughout Imperial as it claimed to
be 'printed and published by
A c a d e m i c s for F r e e S p e e c h ,
Imperial College, L o n d o n . '
Felix was made aware of the
publication and its contents by a
local newspaper in South Shields on
the north east coast of England. T h e
paper received the leaflet in the post
in mid-August and immediately
telephoned Felix to find out if the
printing work was done by the
Imperial College U n i o n Print Unit,
part o f the Felix office. Having no
knowledge of the publication, Felix
made enquiries around the College,
all o f which drew a blank.
T h e publication described the
findings of Fred Leuchter, the U S
execution equipment expert, and
m e n t i o n s D a v i d I r v i n g , the
controversial 'revisionist' historian.
T h e material, of a highly anti-
semitic nature, supported the
findings of Leuchter's report which
claims that in no way could the
chambers at the concentration
camps have been used for the
execution of such a number of
people within the time span o f the
war. It also severely attacks the
various groups that have been
outraged by his report and the book
based on it.
O n hearing about the document,
that had been faxed to Felix, the
Rector, Sir E r i c A s h , said that T
cannot believe that this is Imperial
College Academics' and continued
by saying that 'There are a lot o f
nutters at Imperial College, but I
cannot believe it came f r o m
here'.Senior administrative staff
were extremely surprised when
presented with a copy o f the
publication and comments varied
from 'this is the first I've heard of
it' to 'we will be looking into it'.
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e S e c u r i t y
Officer, Terry Briley, thought that
the document could be considered
to be 'an incitement to racial
hatred', illegal under British law.
H e c l a i m e d that one o f the
government's security departments
he called 'special operations' was
interested in the case.
