'The Tempest' is ultimately a story
about revenge and the humiliation
of those seeking revenge when they
finally have absolute power over
their e n e m i e s . In Peter
Greenaway's visually stunning
adaptation, 'Prospero's Books', we
are shown the story from the idea
that 'The Tempest' was written by
Prospero and that its writing caused
the events to happen. Prospero,
played by S i r John Gielgud, is
abandoned on a barren island with
his baby daughter and some books
from his library. Through the books
he obtains dominion over the
island's spirits and creates his own
kingdom and eventually engineers
the fate o f those who abandoned
h i m . G i e l g u d b r i n g s t h e
Shakespearean language to life so
v i b r a n t l y that, at t i m e s ,
Greenaway's visual imagery seems
unnecessary. Those who have seen
his earlier works, especially ' T h e
C o o k , the Thief, his Wife and her
L o v e r ' will be familiar with his use
of symbolism and colour, and here
again these are used to their utmost
effect. Greenaway also uses this
film to explore a new breed o f
special effect which allows him to
animate the book's contents. This
is not a film w h i c h c a n be
understood from only one viewing.
Return visits are an enjoyable
necessity.

This film is a love story.
Hilary O ' N e i l (Julia Roberts) is
a streetwise young woman who is
totally insecure mainly due to many
failed r e l a t i o n s h i p s w i t h

Geddes (Campbell Scott) is a well
educated rich man who is suffering
from Leukaemia and whose father
wants a full time nurse to take care
of him. Hilary lies about her
qualifications and manages to con
her way into the job. Against his
father's wishes she moves into the
spare room in Victor's flat to help
him after he has been for treatment
at the hospital.
After her fist experience o f his
behaviour once h e ' d been for
chemotherapy she is left with a
decision to make—can she cope
with this every week or should she
leave the m a n w h o is totally
dependent for one night out o f
seven. She stays.
A s the film progresses you see
Victor change. H e is, at the start of
the film, very arrogant and uncaring
but you can see the effects Hilary
is having on him. Y o u see him as
the frail man who needs her help
and support to get through life. She
encourages h i m to develop, she
teaches him to drive, helps him give
up smoking and makes him eat
proper meals. He in turn helps her
develop—teaching her about art and
some o f his favourite artists—she

becomes a strong person, changing
from the depressed and oppressed
lonely girl into someone who could
cope with anything even the fact
that she could be spending the rest
of her life with a man who spends
M o n d a y nights with his head stuck
down a toilet.
It is a moving film. A s Hilary and
Victor are the only two characters
who get any form of development
you become compassionate towards
them and their needs. Although the
film gets a little too sloppy at times
it is well made. Directed by Joel
Schumacher (Flatliners, The Lost
Boys) with a competent production
team (Sally F i e l d a n d K e v i n
M c C o r m i c k ) and a group of expert
actors.
A nice nice way to spend a Friday
evening if you like a good romantic
film and permanently carry a packet
of tissues in your back pocket.
