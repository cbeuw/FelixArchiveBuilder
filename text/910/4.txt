Don't despair. With a Lloyds Bank student
package you won't go hungry.
We've designed it to make your money last
until the end of term.
To start with, you'll receive interest on your
current account. A n d when the going gets
tough, we won't. Nor will we pile on bank charges.
In fact, you can apply for a £400 interest-
free overdraft if you need it.
We've also made the account simpler to
operate, thanks to the Lloyds Bank Payment
Card. You can use it to guarantee cheques up
to £100, withdraw cash and make payments.
And to make travel easier, we'll give you
a free Young Persons Railcard.
For more information, pop into Lloyds Bank
or call us free on 0800 400 470.
We'll make sure you've enough bread, and
butter, cheese, eggs, ham, lettuce . . .
