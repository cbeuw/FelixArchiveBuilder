Felix's travel writers recently left the bright lights of Hong Kong for the blue seas of th$
Philipines. Jon Enoch goes under.
We had arrived in the Philippines from
H o n g K o n g knowing little about the
7000 orso islands that make up the archipela-
go. Having spent a few days in M a n i l a , we
headed for the closest beach in our inevitable
c u l t u r e v u l t u r e m m
s t y l e , a n d t h u s • •
a r r i v e d in P u e r t o
G a l e r a . W e w e r e
amazed at how many clothes
and shoe shops m a n a g e d to
survive in Hong Kong, but on
arrival in Puerto Galera, it was the endless
array of dive shops that beggared belief. For
this many to make-ends-meet there had to be
s o m e t h i n g to this s c u b a lark a n d lurking
b e n e a t h t h o s e c r y s t a l w a t e r s there must
havebeen some sights worth my scrutiny.
I eventually selected an instructor and dive
shop for my open water course. I'm sure my
mother would have wanted me to rake
up the past of every instructor, search-
ing for long forgotten misdemeanours
but at the end of the day, when it came
to it, I trusted my gut instinct. I figured
that if I was going to pay someone to
watch me drown, I might as well like
them!
The practical elements of scuba div-
ing are taught to you during five con-
fined w a t e r s e s s i o n s that s o m e t i m e s
take place in a swimming pool, but in my
case in the sea, where you are taught skills
you would need in the unlikely event that
anything went wrong.
Within minutes of starting my training, I
found myself sitting on the sea floor, nervous
as hell, trying to follow the skills my dive
instructor Darren w a s
d e m o n s t r a t i n g . T h e
someone to watch me f i r s t b r e a t h s y o u t a k e
drown, I may as

was just looking at my feet it was an experi-
ence I shall long remember.
In addition to the confined water lessons, I
also had to complete four real dives during
which you repeat the
skills you have already
learnt. The first dive

water, the s u r f a c e within e a s y reach. The
p r o s p e c t of this r e a s s u r i n g comfort being
taken away was worrying. I imagined all that
could go wrong and played out endless disas-
ter scenarios in my head.
M y instructor and I did the classic back-
ward roll off the dive boat into the crystal-
clear South China S e a , and one more child-
hood ambition was completed. The previous
nights worries were soon forgotten as we
descended to the sea floor. All around me the
coral reef teamed with life. Fish of fantastic'
c o l o u r s s w a m next to me oblivious of m
y
presence and as we drifted along on the cur
rent, I discovered a completely new breath-
taking world. The Philippines has some of the
best marine coral in Asia and I felt privileged
to witness it. I saw things I had never imag-

There was no time to worry about potential
problems, as my mind was far to busy taking
in what it saw.
