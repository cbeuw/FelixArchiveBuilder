An Imperial researcher could soon have big news for the world's beer
drinkers

T
he most important research to come out of
Imperial since the pyramid teabag could be
on its way if a Chemical Engineering PhD stu-
dent's work is successful.
Neil Hepworth has received funding from
B r e w i n g R e s e a r c h I n t e r n a t i o n a l a n d t h e
Biotechnology Research Council in order to
look at the factors which determine how long it
takes a pint of beer to settle. Beer can often
appear cloudy when poured from a keg due to
the formation of nitrogen microbubbles, a high
proportion of which can be stable, meaning that
the beer remains c l o u d y and u n a p p e a l i n g .
According to M r Hepworth, the "gas liquid dis-
persion characteristics" are little understood,
and his project involves "understanding why
bubble haze is formed and predicting its pres-
ence or absence".
P r e s s u r i s e d gas is used to deliver s o m e
beers to the tap, and carbon dioxide was used
in the past. However, for some ales, a C O g and
N2 mixture is used.
Nitrogen is substan-
tially less soluble than
carbon dioxide, however,
some still dissolves in the
l i q u i d , f o r m i n g t h e s e
microbubbles.
M r H e p w o r t h n o t e d
that the composition of
the gas does not seem to
affect the " h a z e dura-
tion" during which bub-
bles are formed. These appear to be deter-
mined by the liquid flow rate into the glass, and
the use of a "sparkler", which is where the tap
narrows in order to create more bubbles.
The work involves using a purpose-built labo-
ratory scale beer tap, together with a synthetic
beer which mimics the properties of commer-
cially-available beer. M r Hepworth is hoping to
use this equipment to construct a comprehen-
sive model of bubble haze, allowing its behav-
iour to be predicted in "any given conditions"
The research is necessary because industry!
methods to determine the behaviour of bubbles!
are case-specific, due to the empirical natureol
previous research. He added "I am trying t
o
explain the phenomenon using the fundamental
scientific principals behind it."
