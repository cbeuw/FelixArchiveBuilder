n Saturday 13th of January, harsh sen-
tences were handed out to seven promi-
nent journalists and intellectuals in Iran. The
ruling is a major s e t - b a c k for t h e Iranian
r e f o r m i s t m o v e m e n t a n d t h e l i b e r a l
President, M o h a m m a d Khatami. H e is now
reconsidering a decision he announced back
in the summer to stand for re-election in the
forthcoming June elections.
These pro-reformists, leading supporters
of Khatami, travelled from Tehran to partici-
pate in t h e B e r l i n C o n f e r e n c e last A p r i l ,
which w a s sponsored by a foundation con-
nected with the G e r m a r

noise and causing general disruption, which
led to the conference being broken up.
Two days later, Iranian s t a t e television

outrage with more than 140 members of the
Iranian parliament labelling the conference as
'counter-revolutionary' and insulting to the
Iranian nation. They called on the Iranian
judiciary to punish t h e Iranians who had
attended the conference in Berlin. Right-wing
newspapers were quick to add their own con-
demnation, saying they had committed trea-
son by consorting with the enemies of the
regime. Reformists too were angered by the
b r o a d c a s t , claiming t h e c o n s e r v a t i v e run
state television were trying to create condi-
tions making it impossible for the new parlia-
ment to do its work.
C a m p a i g n i n g j o u r n a l i s t , A k b a r G a n j i ,
received the most severe sentence; 10 years
imprisonment followed by five years internal
exile at B a s h a r g a d , a remote desert area.
During the course of his investigation, he un-
covered high-level involvement in the mur-
ders of dissident Iranian intellectuals, going
so far as to name some of the alleged cul-
prits in court. S o he had many powerful ene-,

lengthy prison term was Ali Afshari, leader of
the biggest student organization in Iran ( the
Unity Consolidation Bureau ) who got five
years. Just six of the seventeen people tried
were acquitted, while those convicted have
20 clays to appeal.
The prison s e n t e n c e s were much w o r s e
than expected and have put the internal divi-
sion present in Iran in the spotlight again.
Deputy speaker of parliament, M o h a m m a d

M o h a m m a d Khatami ) c o m m e n t e d , 'Those
people... did not commit a crime, and their
treatment by the judiciary w a s wholly fac-
tional and politically motivated.' Germany's
reaction w a s one of deep concern and the
Iranian ambassador to Berlin w a s summoned

Iranian citizens and relations between Iran
and Germany is unacceptable and unreason-

that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's planned
visit to Tehran in the spring has been called
off. The court's ruling may damge bilateral

s t r i c t Islamic
laws and social
r e s t r i c t i o n s
which have been
i m p o s e d since
the Islamic revolution of 1979 which saw the
Shiite clergy come to power. Although press
freedom has been improved, some newspa-
pers expressing opposition to hardliners have
been shut down by conservative clerics. But
the restrictive press law remains unchanged.
The d i f f i c u l t y t h e P r e s i d e n t f a c e s in his
a t t e m p t s to r e f o r m t h e c o u n t r y is that
although the reformists hold a majority in the
Iranian P a r l i a m e n t , t h e S u p r e m e Leader
Mohammad Khamenei has the power to veto
any laws being passed. H e is a conservative
cleric who has already managed to minimize
many hoped-for c h a n g e s . It is feared that
Khatami may not have the power to make his
idea of a new, liberal Iran a reality.
