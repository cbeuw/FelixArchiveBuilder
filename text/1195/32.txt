UBS is an equal opportunity employer. We respect each individual. Our competitive strength lies in leveraging a global diversity of cultures, perspectives,
skills and experiences to achieve our common goals. We believe that professional and personal balance enriches our performance. Progression within
the Bank depends on various factors such as capability, performance and contribution to the firm's success.
Throughout the ten weeks there'll be events which
ensure your experience is packed with learning,
training and networking opportunities. Evaluation will
be a serious element of your programme.
It's a tough process-we'll push you, test you and
evaluate you; but we'll also train you, guide you and
listen to you. Because we really want you to succeed.
