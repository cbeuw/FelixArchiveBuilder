I C I I 2 - 1 U C L I I
A crunch match, six pointer, a
match to test us. After a lengthy
break and only a friendly with the
firsts, from which it was difficult to
draw conclusions, to whip us into
shape, this was a solid and reas-
suring victory.
U n i v e r s i t y C o l l e g e h a d the
upper hand in the early exchanges,
a fast centre forward and a well
drilled midfield had a lot of the
play as we found it difficult to gel
as a unit. For all their early pres-
sure, U C L had nothing to show for
it a s t h e IC s e c o n d s b e g a n to
realise that they had a game on
and got into gear. W e started a
few promising attacks, using the
wings to bypass their strong cen-
tre but couldn't string a scoring
move together.
The first goal was a tonic for
our lethargy. (A somewhat hun-
gover) lain saw a gap and made a
burst into the box but was cynical-
ly f l o o r e d by the o p p o s i t i o n ' s
defense. Controversially, the ref-
eree adjudged that the original
foul had been committed on the
edge of the area and awarded us a
free kick rather than the blatant
penalty (even though I landed far
beyond the penalty spot!). This

"...curled the
ball into the
far bottom
corner.
Magic took the kick and curled the
ball into the far bottom corner and
under the flailing keeper's body.
O n e - nil it stayed until half
time, neither side doing anything
of s i g n i f i c a n c e in a c l o s e a n d
tetchy period of play with only a
couple of half c h a n c e s at each
end. Brad came off for Dave and
Mark came on to bolster the mid-
field.
Things continued the way they
had left off for the early part of
the s e c o n d half but a s U C L
became more and more desper-
ate, they pushed forward increas-
ingly and chances came in hard
and fast at both ends. Last ditch
tackling from "Bruce" L e e Barry
and Fumex and some sensational
saves from J P ("What a save JPi")
kept us in it. Lee made sure that
people as far afield as Cornwall
knew that it was his ball.
At the other end, D a v e and
Eniola really should have done
better with a couple of chances
but at least we got a second from|
"What a
save JP!!!"
a corner. It went long but Dave,
headed it back into the danger]
area and the ball was bundled in
by J .
After this, we had everything
thrown at us but they only man-
a g e d to s c o r e deep into injury
t i m e , d i r e c t f r o m a free kick.
Magic w a s unlucky that it was a
little too high for him at hte fai
post and it went in off his head.
However, it was too little too late

W e won! W e won! W e won!
Victory is so sweet. The Dream
Team of Lucina, Judit, Christina,
Aspa, Joy, Sandrine, Inga, Xana,
Ada and of course our legendary
coach Christos, beat Q M W i n t 0
submission. Eventually it all came
together - right to the end. Aspa
started it all with three smashing
baskets in a row, Lucina was
zooming in shots from outside the
key and from there on nothing
was stopping us. W e fought well
and although our defense was
perhaps not as secure as usual,
we held in until the final whistle.
Let's hope we carry on this win-
ning streak throughout the N e w
Year.

There had been a frost over
Saturday night and it really was
cold. W e assembled at
Harlington at an obscene time in
the morning and with the added
bonus of only 11 players. W e
were a little worried whether we
would be able to play with only 11
players. Georges turned up with
1 3, had they turned up with 1 5
players, things could have been a
little tricky!
The tries came thick and fast.
Blondish Claire was our top try
scorer with 4 tries, which is 20
points, no less. Our other try
scorers were Kerrianne, 3; Kryzi,
2: Anne-Laure, 2; Jessamy, 1; Hui-
Lmg, 1; Kate, 1.
The opposition were very inexperi-
enced, apparently they only have
two players from last year, and
they are two leagues below us.
The ref let them get away with a
tot. It was good practice for us,
however, the back line was work-
ing well and they managed to pull
off some set moves a miracle!
The forwards held the scrums,
even though there were 5 people
in the scrum, and put in a general-
ly good performance.
So we have won our first match of
the season, and are now in the
B U S A cup and U L U league.
Hopefully, this is the morale
booster that we've been looking
for!
