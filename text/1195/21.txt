Quills Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
Director: Philip Kaufmann
Starring: Geoffrey Rush, Michael
Caine and Kate Winslet
A
s soon as I heard about Quills,
I knew I was going to be in for
a treat. It takes no further than the
cast list to see this film must be
something slightly special. Firstly,
we have Geoffrey Rush, one of the
most acclaimed actors of current.
His depiction of S i r F r a n c i s
Walsingham in Elizabeth was mas-
terful, whilst we must not forget
Shine, the story of a piano player,
which earned him an A c a d e m y
Award. Then we h a v e J o a q u i n
Phoenix, Kate Winslet, and finally,
Michael Caine. Need I say more?
^ush plays the Marquis de Sade,
"ho is detained in a mental asylum
'n
Post revolution France. Using a
"^'d (Winslet) he m a n a g e s to
S m u
99le out his titillating stories to
the
General puDlic, unbeknownst to
•he head of the institute, Coulmier

hoenix). However, on the orders

Napolean, Dr. R o y e l - C o l l a r d

top the Marquis from produc-
es his novels, by any means nec-
tary.
^u
'"s
> for the most part, is immi-
n e r
% enjoyable. The entire film
revolves around Rush and his por-
t r a y a l of the M a r q u i s . His
overblown and exuberant interpre-
tation is deliciously extrovert but
never over-the-top. The vivacious-
ness and raucousness he gives the
part, essentially turns every other
character into a bit part. C a i n e
also plays his role superbly; his
cold, calculated bad guy perfectly
c o m p l i m e n t i n g R u s h ' s v o l a t i l e
f l a w e d g e n i u s . N o n e t h e l e s s ,
P h o e n i x and W i n s l e t do not
become totally overshadowed by
these two characters, but allow
them to shine without rendering
themselves totally insignificant.
Unfortunately, the film falls short
solely because of its ending. Until
then, the film's nature is based on
its b a w d i n e s s and sexual over-
tones. This element of fun is taken
unexpectedly from the film in the
last half hour and it becomes much
darker. H o w e v e r , the ending is
rather too long winded and ulti-
mately all the little parts of the film
that made it so intricate are tried
to tie up in a way that is not neces-
sary and essentially makes a silly,
disappointing ending. Otherwise,
this would have been a five out of
five film.

'm tempted to just fill this review
with the following line repeated
over and over again: "Go watch
this movie right now!" But some-
how I don't think that constitutes a
review. But maybe that's just the
way to s e e this movie, without
knowing anything about it, so that
it c r e e p s up on you and slowly
takes hold over your senses. In
fact, stop reading this review and
"Go watch this movie right now!"
The plot is simple; it involves the
theft of an ancient s w o r d , the
G r e e n Destiny, and the interac-
tions between two couples; Li Mu
Bai (Chow Yun Fat), the legendary
warrior and the previous owner of
the s w o r d , and Y u S h u L i e n
(Michelle Yeoh), the woman whom
he secretly loves. The other couple
are played by Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi),
the headstrong daughter of a min-
ister, and the desert bandit Lo
( C h e n C h a n g ) . E s s e n t i a l l y the
s t o r y r e v o l v e s a r o u n d the
repressed feelings between Li Mu
Bai and Shu Lien, and the illicit
love affair between J e n and Lo.
Oh, and did I mention the martial
arts?
The first screening that I attended
played to a full house of hardened
film fans at the recent London Film
Festival, and after a rooftop chase
s e q u e n c e ten minutes into the
movie, every person literally got
up and a p p l a u d e d for half a
minute, so thrilled were they by
this extraordinary sequence. And
that's just one of the sequences!
The acting is spot on, but 19-year-
old Z h a n g Z i y i s t e a l s all her
scenes as the feisty and stubborn
Jen Yu. Not only is she beautiful,
but she also conveys this aura of
haughtiness about her, that makes
her e v e n more u n d e r s t a n d a b l y
attractive to Lo. Praise has to duly
be s h o w e r e d on d i r e c t o r A n g
Lee.Yuen W o Ping's (The Matrix)
fight choreography has raised the
standard for fight sequences and
married with Ang Lee's direction,
is nothing short of breathtaking.
T h e r e is so much more to say
about this film that cannot be stat-
ed in just a few words. For anyone
wary of subtitles, don't be. This
film is a certainty for Best Foreign
Language Picture, but in reality
the accolade it truly deserves is
Best Picture.
