sense that such things are out of our control.
Certainly when my house fell to pieces during
the Northridge California earthquake of 1994 I
came away from the experience with a feeling
of resigned acceptance. After all, we can't
predict this wrath of god sort of stuff... can
we? W e l l , physics researchers at M o s c o w
S t a t e University are proposing that earth-
quakes do not have to be unpredictable any
longer.
In the 19th century an astronomer named
Domenic Aragoe identified the polarization of
solar light reflecting off the surface of several
planets in our solar system. An interesting
find to be sure, but particularly fascinating was
the discovery by scientists in M o s c o w that the
polarization of solar light reflecting off our very
own planet can tell us about the geo-electric
field generated by the earth's plastic interior.

Physics researchers started by suggesting
that to predict earthquakes it was enough to
place a number of monitors in quake prone
areas which detect changes in the Earth's geo-
electric field. In theory this would work, but
unfortunately it is technically difficult and
costly. However, measuring changes in the
geo-electric field can be done by measuring
changes in the polarization of the solar light
reflected from the surface of the Earth. The
polarization always changes in the areas where
intensity of the electric field increases. S o , if
you can monitor the changing polarization of
the light reflected from different parts of the
Earth and find the locations where it is shifting
rapidly you can predict earthquakes.

Smashing gold atoms together and looking at
the results is the activity which the scientists
at the Brookhaven Heavy Ion Collider have
been involved in lately. And the results? The
creation of the highest density matter ever

temperatures of over 1 trillion degrees create!

atoms were blasted together.
Scientists believe that dense matter likethaik
being formed in the collider existed a few mil'
lionths of a second after the Big Bang and are';
thus useful
in developing an understanding of our Jj
verse's formation. They are also hopeful that
the violent collisions will break protons andl
neutrons into their subcomponents, quarks and"
gluons, further revealing the mysterious inter!
nal structure of nuclei.
