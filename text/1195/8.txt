t's winter and the weather is cold and wet.
C h r i s t m a s and N e w Y e a r are over, and
there's a lot of work to do in this long spring
term. It's natural to s o m e t i m e s feel d o w n -
hearted under these circumstances. And it's
understandable not to want to get out of bed
some mornings! (Recognise yourself here?)
Most people feel like this from time to time.
However, if you've been feeling miserable for
several weeks, if you don't seem to be able to
enjoy anything and have lost interest in your
course and your social life, and if this feeling
doesn't seem to be shifting, it's possible that
you might be depressed. Depression is com-
mon within the student population, as it is
within the population in general. And it's pos-
sible - and important - to do something about
it.
Some more questions. Are you eating much
less or much more than usual? Do you feel
tired for much of the time? A r e you having
difficulty getting off to sleep, or do you wake
up several times during the night, or unusual-
ly early, feeling tired and worrying? A r e you
having difficulty concentrating in lectures, or
when you're s t u d y i n g ? A r e you wanting to
avoid contact with your friends? Are you feel-
ing particularly critical of y o u r s e l f ? Is it a
struggle to actually think, to work out what
you have to do, or to make decisions?
If you're experiencing some of these diffi-
c u l t i e s , it's important to talk to s o m e o n e
about it: depression can be a downward spi-
ral involving - for some - feeling that it's not
worth carrying on with the course, or indeed
(for a small proportion of people) with your
life. Sometimes depressed people feel suici-
dal, and s o m e t i m e s d e p r e s s e d p e o p l e kill
themselves. Clearly, it's vital to interrupt this
pattern. Although the last thing you might
want to do is to talk to someone about how
you're feeling, it's important that you do. You
might be imagining that you're the only per-
son in the world feeling like this, and not cop-
ing, but there are certainly other students
around who will be feeling the same way, yet
not w a n t i n g to let a n y o n e know about it.
College might not seem to be a place where
it feels O K to admit to not coping.
It's useful to consider the broader context
in order to understand some people's experi-
ence of depression. Life for some students
has become significantly more stressful over
the past few years; you might have to work
to support yourself through College and the
cost of accommodation is high. Hence this is
the context within which you have to navigate
the demanding workload. You might be feel-
ing d i s a p p o i n t e d that y o u r e x p e r i e n c e at
College isn't turning out to be what you had
hoped for and expected. You might also be
feeling homesick; perhaps you're a long way
from home w h i c h might be in a d i f f e r e n t
country. If you're a mature student you might
have to juggle the responsibilities of child-
care and domestic tasks along with perhaps
the academic challenge of returning to edu-
cation after a period in employment. If you're
slipping behind with course work and missing
an increasing number of lectures, it's impor-
tant to a c k n o w l e d g e this. Don't bury your
head in the sand. Talk to your personal tutor,
senior tutor, postgraduate tutor, or someone
e l s e y o u f e e l y o u c a n a p p r o a c h in y o u r
department. If you have slipped a long way
behind, talk to someone anyway so that you
can work out a course of action to attend to
your situation.
W h o else can you contact if you're feeling
low? You could contact one of the C o l l e g e
student counsellors, or a practice nurse or
doctor in the Health Centre.
