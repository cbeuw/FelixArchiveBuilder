(Shifty Disco)
Shifty Disco are better known for discover-
,ng what is best about the Oxford music
scence, or the alt rock scence in the US.
yet this is their voyage into Southern
flavoured US country. The basic idea is
H
a
n
k Williams with a small dash of Beck.
It sounds strange, is chirpy and uplifting,
vet is exceeding uncool. What the hell, lis-
ten to this in secret, no one will know.

B
o
y Is Crying
(Mantra)
Having been around for nine years
now, St Etienne return once again,
this time with the relaxed, contem-
plative style of Boy Is Crying. Taking
elements from several genres, this
falls somewhere between pop and
garage. It's fairly pleasant and easy
to listen to, but unremarkable.

Ash
Shining Light
(Infectious)
A s h are back on form, after the
grown up nonsense of Nu-Clear
Sounds. In the intervening two
years since the last material, Tim
Wheeler has grown a Billy Corgan
esque snarl. The subject is standard
Ash fair, you know the sort of the
things, chemical reactions caused
by lovely ladies. Ash are having a
second adolesence and long may it
last.
Fatboy Slim Macy
Gray - Demons
(Skint)
D e m o n s represents a significant
change in style for Fatboy Slim. It's
far more laid-back than usual, with
a distinctive piano sample. A l s o ,
rather than using sampled vocals
from other people's material, this
t r a c k has a c o m p l e t e l y original
v o c a l line, p e r f o r m e d by M a c y
Gray. A bit different, but still sure
to be successful.
Semisonic

s starts off well enough as guitar,
Thi
tass, drums and piano combine to
produce a decent rock introduction.
0 u r
lead singer then tells a story for a
hit, which is all perfectly agreeable.
And then, just as I'm preparing to give
''3/5, in comes the chorus, sung by...
a
'°ad of kids. This d o e s s e e m to
o w
er the standard considerably, but
a
Pa r
t from that this is O K .
Chemistry
(MCA)
This is the latest release from the
band who brought us b e a u t i f u l
S e c r e t S m i l e and the a n t h e m i c
C l o s i n g T i m e two y e a r s a g o .
Though not as instantly memorable
as either of those, Chemistry con-
tains many of the hallmarks found in
other Semisonic releases, and so it
should do well. A new album fol-
lows.

It's A Shifty Disco Thing...Volume 4
(Shifty Disco)
You've got to love grassroots record labels. Where the hell else are
you going to find music that challenges your ingrained preconcep-
tions of what music can be? Who's going to move you to tears with a
single plucked G-string (ahem)?
Of course, I am being a muso twat. If you are going to sound like a set
of stairs falling down a set of stairs just for the sake of it, then you
aren't going to impress anyone. Some of the bands on this compilation
have that special something that will always set them apart, whilst the
rest have just added bibbling noises over the top.
Some history first. Initially aimed at documenting the surprisingly fer-
tile Oxford indie scene, Shifty Disco soon cast a wider net once the
local reserves of pop-punk and over-earnest indie had been exhaust-
ed, by attracting bands from above the M 2 5 and in the U S to their
roster and monthly Singles Club. This album compiles the twelve A-
sides from that club's fourth year, and like most compilations, there is
some gack to wade through before you unearth the gems.
I guess I just have a problem with indie-schmindie songs with stupid
titles and bad singing. But Locomotiv's "Next Time 'Round" is essen-
tially a man and his acoustic, which would have been perfectly pleas-
ant if he hadn't let someone dribble over some decks in the back-
ground. The Burt Lump Orchestra are about as inspiring as their
name, and others drag and meander without planting a decent tune in
your cranium. After a few tracks like that, Black Moses appear like a
life-saving breath of fresh air simply by being a bit loud.
But there are highlights. Formula 1 step out of Stereolab's shadow
and make "indie-rock" a genre that doesn't make you want to gouge
your eye out with a rusty spoon. Pluto Monkey are either the best or
worst thing you've ever heard, what with their utterly deranged cut-
price Pet Shop Boys effort. Vigilance Black Special sound genuinely
heartfelt for a change, even with a trombone, and Panda Gang are
faux-soul without being an offensive piss-take.
It's a mixed bag, both quality- and style-wise, so the chances are you'll
find something you'll love along with something you'll detest. That's
what I found anyway.
PS - Shifty Disco have also released stuff by Beulah, Creeper Lagoon
and Nought among others. All are ace, particularly Beulah. Check
them out too.
