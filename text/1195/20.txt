Cast Away Vertical Limit
Director: Robert Zemeckis
Starring: T o m Hanks and Helen
Hunt
C
huck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a
FedEx systems engineer who
takes his job very seriously - much
to the chagrin of his girlfriend Kelly
(Helen Hunt). On one of his trips
his plane crashes, killing everyone
else on board and stranding him on
a r e m o t e i s l a n d . A l o n e and
stripped of all everyday conven-
iences he must first survive, and
then find a way to get back home.
Obviously much of the success of
the film lies on Tom Hanks shoul-
ders. Here he confirms that he can
effortlessly carry a film. He gives a
very subtle performance, never
giving the audience the impression
that he is trying too hard. While on
the island he manages to sustain
interest over long periods where
very little happens. He also shows
a light comic touch reminiscent of
his earlier films (e.g. Big)
The big q u e s t i o n t h o u g h is
whether he'll win the best actor
Oscar. He has achieved the weight
loss/gain, which is always a good
sign and seems to be an academy
favourite. However, I don't think
his performance is showy enough
to stand out to the academy.
The direction is very workmanlike
and unemotional. This is surpris-
ing, given that the man at the helm
is Robert Z e m e c k i s , responsible
for such w a r m and imaginative
classics as Back to the Future and
F o r e s t G u m p . It s e e m s that in
splitting his attention between this
and What Lies Beneath (which he
shot while Tom Hanks was losing
weight for the second half of the
film). Subsequently hasn't put his
heart into either.
The plot and character develop-
ment is also poor. The relationship
between Hanks and Helen Hunt is
introduced too quickly and in a
heavy-handed way. There is no
e f f o r t by the w r i t e r ( W i l l i a m
Broyles Jr.) to develop any char-
acter other than Hanks. This is
s u r p r i s i n g given that he a l s o
penned the excellent Apollo 13 in
which all the main characters were
three-dimensional. If not for Hanks'
endearing performance Cast Away
would be average at best. If only
the whole film packed his emotion-
al punch, then it would have been
very special.
Castaway is in cinemas now.

T
his is a film truly for the lowest
common denominator; a film
that the stupidest people in the
world will enjoy whilst those with
an ounce of intelligence will dis-
miss within ten s e c o n d s of the
opening credits ending.
The storyline is based on a group
of climbers who become stranded
whilst scaling the mountain K 2 .
The team is led by a businessman
who is doing it as a publicity stunt
for his company. You know they
are going to fail before they put
their big furry socks on. Anyway,
the brother of one of the stranded
decides to launch a rescue mission
"for the sake of my sister and my
dad". Yes, it really is that cliched.
But get-this, they decide to use
some superduper form of nitro-
glycerine to blow them out of the
cavern they are trapped in! For
G o d ' s s a k e , it d o e s n ' t t a k e a
chemist (which I am) to realise this
isn't a good idea. But the film con-
tinues plodding along, sincerely
believing it could pull the wool over
the audience's eyes with this, pos-
sibly the most ridiculous proposi-
tion in movie history.
Vertical Limit has every cliche
imaginable, and takes banality on
to a whole new plane. If that was-
n't enough, it smacks of American
chauvinism, possibly the most infu-
riating characteristic of big modem
Hollywood films.
In addition, there are astonishing
errors. The climbers are at 26,000
feet yet their breath doesn't con-
dense. The nitroglycerine explosive
is luminous green! Not forgetting it
reacts with light whilst in it's metal
container. This film, in parts, is
embarrasingly laughable.
Granted, the locations on the film
are unbelievably beautiful and con-
stitute its only redeeming quality-
The c a s t are no better than
mediocre, whilst Martin Campbell
the director, has lost the plot (pun
intended) since his previous offer-
ings of Golden Eye and Mask of
Zorro. By the end of the film, how-
ever, when the characters are i
d o w n with pulmonary
c o m i n g
for
oedema, you would be forgiven
thinking that your in the local e a r
nose and throat hospital, a v l S , t t
°
which wou Id probably be more
than watching Vertical Limit.
Vertical Limit is in cinemas no*
