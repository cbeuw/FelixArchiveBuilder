Lack of money and worries over space forces freshers into crumbling
hails for another year
J WILLIAM FOSTER
L
ack of money is unofficially being blamed for
College's decision to k e e p the decrepit
Southside Halls open for another year.
College House Committee, meeting last week,
took the decision to put the proposed reno-
vation back until "mid 2002", citing the pos-
sibility of a shortage of hall places if the
! building were to be closed in October as
| planned. With Willis Jackson Hall due to be
j closed as part of the rolling refurbishment in
Evelyn Gardens, and Beit Hall due to reopen
this Summer following its troubled refurbish-
ment, there was a very real possibility that
there would not be enough hall space next
year to go round. The problem was only
solved this year by keeping Willis Jackson
open for another year and sharing the
remaining first years between Wilson House
in Notting Hill and Clayponds Village, Ealing
(Felix 1182).
However, senior C o l l e g e sources privately
admitted that the decision was also heavily influ-
enced by lack of money for the project. The rede-
velopment's price, estimated as "tens of millions"
is heavily increased by the fact that Southside is a
grade 2 listed building, and any development
would have to fit in with surrounding buildings.
This ruled out complete demolition, as the College
would only get permission for a four-storey build-
ing in future, seriously limiting the number of
rooms.
Union sources described the decision was
"unfortunate but necessary", with President
Hamish Common adding that College "had no

The Albert Hall's South Porch redevlopment
has been delayed by a year due to concerns
over finding the right type of stone. Although

Evans, Deputy President (Education & Welfare)
agreed that Southside "does need extensive reno-
vation, but they can't risk losing bedspaces."
The decision to refurbish Southside was first
announced in January 2000 to start last October,
at which time the hall was described by the then
Deputy President Ian Clifford as "past its life
on schedule in May, the plans to construct a
new porch on the same side of the building
on the scale of the other three porches have
b e e n set b a c k . It c o m e s a f t e r E n g l i s h

the French manufacturers. English Heritage
are anxious to avoid a repeat of the British
Museum fiasco, where the stone used failed
to match the Portland stone of the surround-
ing building.

next few weeks by people claiming to be mar-
ket researchers outside the Sherfield Dining
Hall are advised not to contact Security- they
have permission to be there. The researchers
span." However, the development was put back
to this October to allow "a greater planning time".
College at the time denied rumours that that deci-
sion was down to a lack of funds.
Southside residents described as "nasty" and
"falling apart" when contacted by Felix. College
are rumoured to be having health and safety
issues with some of the kitchens, and next year's
residents are likely to be hoping that they are the
last before the project. A substantial amount of
maintainance work and network wiring has been
delayed over the past year as the hall was due to
close.
College Catering are also believed to be hoping
to refurbish Southside Bar as a separate project
from the refurbishment, although whether this will
be allowed to go ahead depends on the position of
the Bar in the new Southside, and whether it will
be able to remain open during the main project..
C o l l e g e ' s long-term strategy is to sell off
Garden Hall and all of Northside (excluding
W e e k s Hall). Past and present residents of
Garden and the Union have expressed concerns
that r e s i d e n c e s are being pushed by the
Conference Office to concentrate on providing
high-quality single rooms with en-suite bathrooms,
while students looking for more affordable double
rooms will be pushed further afield by the sales of
Garden and Montpelier Halls.
