Dear Felix,
Just a quick correction on the cine-
ma theft (Felix News, 17th Jan) -
at the moment it looks as though
the money that was in cinema's
stolen safe will be covered by our
insurance (though this has not yet
been confirmed).
However, if the insurance policy
hadn't covered thefts of money
then the Union would not have
refunded the loss - this is because
the money should have been put in
the bank the morning after the all-
nighter, but was instead left in the
safe over the entire C h r i s t m a s
vacation. This is a serious breach
of f i n a n c i a l p r o c e d u r e s and is
being dealt with accordingly.
Can I therefore take this opportu-
nity to remind everyone who han-
dles club & s o c i e t y m o n e y
(whether it be membership sub-
scriptions or other sorts of income)
that all cash should be deposited
in the bank as soon as
possible - the income form for the
Finance Office can follow along
later, but to s a v e y o u r s e l f the
embarassment of having all your
club's membership subscriptions
stolen (naming no names...) just
get the c a s h out of y o u r s o c k
d r a w e r and into the N a t W e s t
bank.
Thank you!

Dear Felix,
I would like to counter M . Ali
Choudry's characterisation of cli-
mate change ("Praise be to Global
Warming?", Felix 1192) as a prob-
lem not worth getting worked up
over. In this he parts company
with even B P and Shell, who now
support carbon-reduction efforts.
T h o u g h M r . C h o u d r y p l a y s up
uncertainties over whether or not
warming has occurred in the past
century, the important question is
whether warming will occur in the
next. Most evidence in fact sug-
gests that warming should not
yet be detectable, but will acceler-
ate in the
coming decades.
Mr. Choudry also contends that
warming predictions have been
d e c l i n i n g with b e t t e r m o d e l s ,
implying that doubtless the prob-
lem will all go away when we know
more. Unfortunately, warming is
only one aspect -- for example,
some models show less warming
yet predict g r e a t e r e f f e c t s on
another dimension such as rainfall,
which might be equally catastroph-
ic.
M o s t worrying, however, is Mr.
Choudry's perverse equating of
the positive effects of clubbing in
Torquay with the negative effects
of mass famine and flooding in
Bangladesh. His rosy economic
picture of lower housing and cloth-
ing bills also fails to include the
costs of malaria, cholera, and
t r o p i c a l crop p e s t s s p r e a d i n g
through E u r o p e , i n c r e a s e s in
severe storms (which caused 250
billion pounds of damage over the
past decade), and heat waves and
water shortages.
Finally, limiting carbon emissions
need not damage the economy. A
U . S . D e p t . of E n e r g y s t u d y
showed that simply encouraging
greater energy efficiency could
cut emissions by a third while also
saving billions on energy expens-
es. The E c o n o m i s t a g r e e s that
action must be taken now as the
cost will only increase later. And if
the bill is put off until later, guess
who will be paying it? That's plen-
ty enough reason for today's stu-
dents to be concerned about cli-
mate change now.

C A N S O M E O N E WRITE S O M E

Dear Felix,
Thanks very much to last week's
correspondent who suggested the
revolutionary idea of a revolving
restaurant on top of the Queen's
Tower. Here in the Estates devi-
sion we are always on the lookout
for new and original ideas for how
to improve the C o l l e g e environ-
ment. In fact, I am p l e a s e d to
announce that the development
will now go ahead, after College
secured a donation from Damien
Hirst, the well known restauran-
teaur, who is looking to open up
a n o t h e r f r a n c h i s e of his
" P h a r m a c y " r e s t a u r a n t . T h e
C o l l e g e a r c h i t e c t s , F o s t e r and
P a r t n e r s , a s s u r e us that the
scheme is viable, and have insisted
that there is no need to call in a
structural engineer to check.
The restaurant, due for completion
in 2010, will also house Basics dur-
ing the Southside redevelopment.
H o w e v e r , the a r c h i t e c t s have
asked us to ensure that all queues
for food in the area of develop-
ment areformed in circles from
now onwards, and that no swaying
motions are allowed to occur.

Dear M r John Clifford,
I saw your picture on your page 3
few months ago and I have really
wanted to talk to you ever since. I
think you talk a lot of sense and I
really like reading your editorials
and your news stories. I am sorry
to hear that you don't get to sleep
much, and I would like to do your
job for a night so you can go and
sleep. Or if you are having prob-
lems sleeping I would sing you to
sleep. I have decorated my room
with lots of pictures of you. I wish I
w a s that p e n . Y o u have a nice
smile I bet you are dead clever. I
sometimes see you passing with a
trolley on a Monday and I noticed
you like to buy spring rolls around
3am on Thursday. Dr Lamb tells |
me I am bad to watch you, but I
really really really want to talk to
you. Please call me, and p l e a s e
I
don't run away when I talk to y°
It makes me sad.
I'm your biggest fan.
Eric Shepherd
