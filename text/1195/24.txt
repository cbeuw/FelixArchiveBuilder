1: Serpentine Gallery 2: The Royal Academy
Originally built as a tearoom, the
S e r p e n t i n e has also a c t e d as a
gallery since the 6 0 ' s . It has no
permanent collection of its own,
but serves an exhibition centre for
modern and contemporary stuff. It
also acts as an overflow for the
Hayward on occasion.
The Serpentine is free, and just up
the r o a d f r o m c o l l e g e in H y d e
Park; making it more than suitable
for a Wednesday afternoon excur-
sion in the summer (or any time of
year, given that).
I'm also informed that they do a
very good series of talks, if that's
your cup of tea.

Set in Burlington House in Piccadilly,
the RA does have a small permanent
collection - mainly comprising of the
works of its original students, eg
Turner and Constable - but it is not
for this that people go here.
The R A plays host to a series of
exhibitions, albeit of often fluctuat-
ing quality - the recent years have
both seen some very good exhibi-
tions (eg the oh-so-popular Monet
and Sensation) and some very bad
o n e s (last y e a r ' s A p o l c a l y p s e
springs to mind). The usual stan-
dard however is very strong.
The R A has a certain cheerfully
pretentious c h a r m , and adds a
certain ceremony to going to an
art gallery; with the g r a n d i o s e
courtyard, marble staircase and
light, airy galleries.
In terms of going to see it howev-
er, the RA is only ever as good as
its present exhibition - and to see
if it'll float your boat or wilt your
flowers, read the arts pages of
your trusty mag, Felix.

3: The British Museum
Excusing perhaps that thing in
Greenwich, the British M u s e u m
is said to be Britain's most popu-
lar tourist attraction (second to
Blackpool Beach) with some six
million visitors a year. It houses
over four million exhibits and the
w o r l d ' s g r e a t e s t c o l l e c t i o n of
antiquities. It has a colourful his-
tory - in the days of Empire, all
the colonial stuff that was looted
and p i l l a g e d h a d to go some-
where, and it all got put in here.
Its inclusion in a piece on galleries
might be questionable, but there is
much here of artistic, rather than
strictly historical, value; a gallery I
drawings and prints, the contents
of which rotate regularly; and also
many of the antiquities, such as any
number of friezes and columns).
You couldn't visit everywhere here
in a day if you jogged. Casual vis-
tors might be put off by its seals
but within its looming galleries are
more art than you could shake3
tree at, and if all this crumbles
your biscuit then there is a 9°
series of regular tours which se^
to m a k e the w h o l e thing
more approachable.
