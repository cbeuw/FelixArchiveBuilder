Firstly. I n a v e t w o
w o r d s to s a y to post
graduates c o m p l a i n i n g about being finan-
cially i m p o v e r i s h e d - ah d i d d u m s . A s
undergraduates you had grants, didn't pay
tuition f e e s a n d didn't g r a d u a t e w i t h an
average of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 d e b t . Y e s , there are
halls of r e s i d e n c e for y o u , and you aren't
forced to pay private s e c t o r L o n d o n rents
for two or three y e a r s if you couldn't get
one of about twenty re-applicant positions,
lam a w a r e that not all P G c o u r s e s are
funded, but you are s u p p o s e d l y older and
wiser than us. S o then w h y did you chose
to come to i m p e r i a l f u c k i n g c o l l e g e . I
wouldn't.

claimed we have a variety of c o u r s e s A M D

Actually, what h a p p e n s is that as we are a
small year group (now numbering eleven),

balances no harder than a junior logic puz-
zle because the M S c s w e r e c o n f u s e d . O u r
timetable is changed with less than twenty
four hours notice so the M S c students can
have preliminary lectures. I don't want to
really start on the lack of staff, but lets
just say we did not have a third year co-
ordinator until the last day of term.
We do technically have an option. W e are
required to do (on top of a t w e n t y - f i v e
hour lecture s c h e d u l e a n d t w e n t y h o u r s
minimum of a s s e s s e d coursework a week)
to do a humanities option. W e can c h o o s e
which h u m a n i t i e s o p t i o n . H o w e v e r w e
aren't given time to a t t e n d the c o u r s e .
Last term we c h o s e our option and then
found as w e h a d f i v e / s i x h o u r s of
timetable lectures at lunchtime each week
our classes had to be on o b s c u r e d a y s or
times. The lectures we could attend w e r e
on Friday lunchtimes. N o w after c o m m i t -
ting to the 'option1
, studying for the tests
and agonising over the extra c o u r s e w o r k ,
this term we have timetabled lectures on a
Friday lunchtime. Still on the timetabling
issue, I have a question for you all. D o you
think that l e c t u r e s from 9 to 5 (with no
lunchbreak) is reasonable for first years let
alone third y e a r s w i t h big p r o j e c t s , 4 - 5
pieces of a s s e s s e d coursework a week and
The l i x
ists is that they place the welfare of ani-
mals above the welfare of people. To me,
people should be intrinsically more impor-
tant to other people than animals. A c t s of
violence against people or destroying their
ways of life is a far more heinous offence
than anything you could do to an animal.
I'm not saying that u n n e c e s s a r y a b u s e of
animals is right, its just a question of prior-
ity.
In trying to ban fox hunting, the extremists
have picked an e a s y target. Fox hunting is
a country s p o r t , w h i c h it has long b e e n
perceived to be mainly done by "rich, upper
class snobs". The never ending class war in
this hierarchy-marred country means that
it is an e a s y task to drum up public support
in the apparently downtrodden, "holier than
thou" urban p o p u l a t i o n . N e v e r mind the
country c o u s i n s of t h e s e d o w n t r o d d e n
peoples, the people who have s e e n their
9 to 5 l e c t u r e s ? T h i s T u e s d a y w e w e r e
s u p p o s e d to h a v e l e c t u r e s 9 to 1 2 , an
exam (not test) 12 to 2 and lectures 2 to
five. O u r T h u r s d a y afternoon this w e e k is
actually free, but it doesn't fit in with what
the M S c s are doing.
W h y rant to us y o u s a y . That is my third
point. W e have a staff student committee
and d e d i c a t e d y e a r reps who attend meet-
ings. Nothing c o m e s of our contribution to
these meetings. The only s y s t e m that gave
us n o t a b l e r e s p o n s e s f r o m l e c t u r e s w a s
t h e o l d p i n k l e c t u r e r f e e d b a c k f o r m s .
T h e s e n o w h a v e b e e n r e p l a c e d w i t h an
u n s u c c e s s f u l internet v e r s i o n which d o e s
not include our department.
S o that's why you're getting this.
Finally, on a different subject, what is the
o b s e s s i o n with wearing s h o e s in the show-
e r s a n d a r o u n d the s w i m m i n g p o o l ? Y o u
are about to s w a l l o w X amount of diluted
b e a c h w h i c h at l e a s t 10 p e o p l e (at a n
u n d e r e s t i m a t e ) h a v e p i s s e d in. Is f o o t
hygiene really that important?
P S I really like your editiorials.
Thankyou Summa, flattery will get you
everywhere. In future articles will only be
printed if they contain at least one compli-
ment -Ed
traditional s o u r c e s of i n c o m e e v a p o r a t e ,
for one reason or another, and who d e p e n d
in m a n y a r e a s on t h e l u c r a t i v e c o u n t r y
s p o r t s industry. W i t h o u t this, they'd have
nothing left and b e c o m e a further burden
on our bloated welfare s y s t e m .
W h a t w o r r i e s m e m o s t of all, e v e n more
than the brutal a t t a c k s on people, is that
t h e s e g r o u p s of v i o l e n t n u t c a s e s won't
stop. They won't s t o p until nobody in this
country is allowed to eat meat. Their ideal
s o c i e t y is o n e in w h i c h m e a t doesn't f e a -
t u r e , they'll h a v e a g o at s t a g h u n t i n g ,
r o u g h s h o o t i n g , d r i v e n s h o o t i n g , fishing
(the most participated in sport in the coun-
try) and then finally meat.
Y o u m a y s u p p o r t t h e s e p e o p l e o v e r fox
hunting, fair enough - its your d e c i s i o n , but
be a w a r e of what t h e s e people ultimately
want and ask y o u r s e l f if this is what you
want too before you back them further.
