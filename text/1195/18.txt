here aren't many dance compi-
l a t i o n s e r i e s t h a t o v e r t h e
years are consistently innovative
and up to date. Obvious examples
h o w e v e r a r e the Gatecrasher
a l b u m s a n d t h e Global
Underground Albums. O n e of the
most hotly awaited dance C D s this
year has been the Clubbers Guide
to 2001 compilation and with a col-
lection of successful older siblings
(2000, '99, etc), the quality of mix-
ing and range of tracks was always
b o u n d to be g o o d . T h e t h e m e
remains the s a m e with a look to
the y e a r s up and c o m i n g t u n e s .
Although several of the tracks will
immediately be familiar to the reg-
ular c l u b b e r ' s ear, m a n y of the
tunes are as yet u n r e l e a s e d and
s u g g e s t an interesting if a little
p r e d i c t a b l e n e a r f u t u r e of t h e
House music scene. The first C D
contains a funky, intelligent collec-
tion of b e a t s i n c l u d i n g Rui D a
Silver Touch me, S a n t o s Camels,
the p o p u l a r J o s h u a R y a n Pistol
Whip, and some sure future clas-
sics like C l e p t o m a n i a c s All I do
a n d t h e v e r y d a r k but c l e v e r
Schiller Glockenspiel.
The s e c o n d C D is t r a d i t i o n a l l y
m o r e u p b e a t w i t h t r a c k s l i k e
Storm Animal and Feel the Beat
by D a r u d e a n d t h e f u t u r i s t i c
s o u n d i n g , t e e t h g n a s h i n g L o s t
W i t n e s s 7 colours. D e s p i t e the
stark variations in the music style,
the tunes flow together seamless-
ly and provide another M u s t Buy
for the year 2001.

Competition Time!
And You Will Know Us by the
Trail of Dead ...
Live @ ULU
F
our geeks dressed in black,
with a dumb band name and
song titles like Children of the
Hydra's Teeth. Not exactly a
r e c i p e for musical c o o l , is it?
W e l l , fuck y o u r m u s i c a l c o o l .
From the moment these geeks
walk out on stage, the audience
are utterly in their thrall. For
tonight, we are about to experi-
ence The Most Punk Rock Gig In
The World ... Ever!
The g u i t a r s are loud, the
d r u m m i n g is brutal, and pure
T e x a n s w e a t s p a t t e r s the
upturned faces of the lucky front-
row punters. Y o u really can't
beat melodic tunes played at ear-
bleeding volume. With shouting.
But this is no mere Foo Fighters
pastiche, and it avoids the whiny
crap that makes Placebo such a
revolting prospect these d a y s .
Instead, we get furious ranting,
sarcastic put-downs and a dash
of worldly wise nihilism.
A s the m o n s t e r riff of
Mistakes and Regrets t e a r s
around the packed venue, lead
singer Jason Reese assures us
that " there is nothing left to say
/ that has not been said". W e
grin stupidly, and pogo harder
than before. Memories of Sonic
Youth's Daydream Nation come
flooding back. A s the thudding
Sign Your Children kicks in, we
grin stupidly (again) and throw
things at the band. They grin,
and throw things back. F i r s t
themselves, Jason surfing around
the a u d i e n c e like D a v i d Y o w
(Jesus Lizard) at his most ener-
g e t i c . Then c o m e the instru-
ments, some torn and tangled. I
have to wrestle a sweating behe-
moth of a man to grab a guitar
strap. Is it just me, or is this turn-
ing into Fight Club? Finally, mon-
itors and lighting rigs come tum-
bling into the pit of people, at
which point the power is cut. The
band leap into the audience, to be
surrounded by people wanting to
shake their hands, thank them for
the best show of their lives, offer
up their immortal souls ...

By now your juices should be in'
full flow due to the anticipa-
tion caused by the coming of the
N M E Carling Awards Shows. Why |
s h o u l d you c a r e ? W e l l for onei
week only, the N M E invites down'
it's favourite bands and Carling:
brings down 12 trucks of lager.
T o g e t h e r , they are the perfect
match.
For the last week, J J 7 2 , Amen, the!
stupidly good Alfie and Starsailor
have been travelling round the
country. Ending up at the penulti-
mate night of the London Astoria
s h o w s . O t h e r bands on display
include...Trail of Dead (see left),
Red Snapper and At The Drive-In,
Each night between Jan 29th and
Feb 5th, features 4 acts for a ten-
ner. Tickets are selling quick, and I
some of the dates have sold out
already. This is probably the most
frantic and m e s s y week of the I
y e a r . O v e r the last two years
f l e d g l i n g a c t s l i k e s Mogwai,
Mercury Rev, The Beta Band and
Muse turned supernova after play-
ing these shows.
So the competition; we have one J
first p r i z e of a N M E Carling
Awards Leather jacket, which
been informed is very nice Then
CD
