: National Portrait Gallery
Of all the galleries listed here, the
National Portrait Gallery has per-
haps the most instant appeal; lying
a S it does, not with the actual
works or painters themselves, but
rather the subject matter.
The appeal of the place is essen-
tially that it is like a 2 D Madame
Tussaud's, with every famous his-
torical figure you'd care to name
staring down at you from across
the centuries. If this scratches
your itch then it is well worth a
visit, to see all the famous figures
m their varied historical settings.
A good site to check out prior to
going is the U n u s u a l Facts and
Figures site on the website, so as
you don't miss the gallery's more
esoteric paintings - such as one
the size of your thumbnail, a por-
trait of 400 people and a wide,
squat painting d e s i g n e d to be
viewed as you walk towards it up
a corridor - very clever.
The 20th century is also well repre-
sented, although in recent times the
focus has shifted less from great
thinkers and politicians and shifted
more toward pop and film stars.

a very high standard, and don't just
repeat what it says by the paintings
(like in the Tate Modern and other
places I could mention).
A fine piece of innovation is also
the Sainsbury Wing, which features
a unique "micro gallery". Here you
can locate your favourite pieces,
and even plan and print out your
own personal tour - by no means
necessary on a first visit, but a nice
feature nonetheless.

6: Tate Modern
This art behemoth on the South
Bank, in the shadow of St Paul's
and opposite That Bridge, opened
relatively recently to great public
acclaim. C o n v e r t e d from an old
power station, it houses a massive
collection of modern art by artists
such as Dali, Picasso, Matisse, and
Warhol, has a wide range of people
coming to see it and the added dis-
tinction of being free.
You don't have to be into art (what-
ever that means) to enjoy the Tate
Modern, as it does, and probably
has been designed to, appeal to
everyone on some level. Those with
a keen interest in art, and those
who just enjoy being continually sur-
prised and shocked by the pieces on
display will be both leave happy.
Having been greeted by the "Half-
Life S p i d e r " in the G r e a t Hall,
make your way upstairs to the gal-
leries where to paraphrase slightly,
there is great art you do know and
great art you don't.
I'm told the cafe is quite good too.

National is also a fine example
7: Tate Britain
The Tate Britain in Pimlico seems to
get forgotten these days with all the
buzz around the Tate Modern, but
it's older sister is still worth a visit.
The Tate Britain is the national
gallery of British art from 1500 to
the present day, "the Tudors to the
Turner Prize" - its collection pass-
ing through such heavyweights as
Blake, Constable, Gainsborough
and Turner (the Blake, Hogarth and
Turner areas being especially worth
visiting - see, for free, most of the
works from two of last year's most
popular exhibitions, aha).
The T a t e M o d e r n h o u s e s the
Tate's modern art collection, but
the Tate Britain still plays home to
the annual Turner prize - a compe-
tition of B r i t i s h a r t i s t s , and a
another good reason to come here.
It allows one to see what is cur-
rently going on in the world of art;
and whether you like it or not.

8: The V&A
The world's largest museum of "dec-
orative art", the V&A is a museum-
cum-gallery featuring 145 galleries
packed full of paintings, sculptures,
tapestries and all manner of decora-
tive titbits and objets d'art. The
exhibits from all across the world in
the seven miles and four floors of
galleries make for several repeat vis-
its, and being just up the road from
college it is suitable for both taking it
all in, or just wandering around.
The V & A is v e r y p l e a s a n t a n d
unchallenging, compared to the
classical pomp and cirumstance
one is more likely to find in say,
the British Museum.
O n e to w a t c h is the C a n o n
Photography Gallery. The museum
has always had a large collection of
photos, and this gallery should make
for some interesting exhibitions in
time to come - it is certainly a better
venue than the previous, in-the-
basement-outside-the-cafe anyway.

Alternatively...
There are many more places out
there that for reasons of space
couldn't be included. Check out a
listings magazine such as Time Out
for details.
The Last Word...
For whatever reason, you decid-
ed to come and study here, in
bonny London. Now, this decision
has brought with it certain negative
points... the expense of such basic
commodities as accommodation
and beer, the g e n e r a l dirt and
grime, and the feeling of alienation
that comes of Irving in a big city.
But there are also certain compen-
sations. London also has so many
things out there worth seeing and
doing, and many of them will not
cost a penny piece to visit for a stu-
dent such as yourself - including all
but one of the ph a.
And so forget science and do some-
thing arty with your W e d n e s d a y
a f t e r n o o n s and w e e k e n d s . Y o u
know it makes sense.
