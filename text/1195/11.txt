Clinton's Eleventh Hour
Clinton's final days have come to a close,
but they were hardly days that he spent twid-
dling his thumbs. In the period of the presi-
dency termed "the eleventh hour" Clinton,
much to the c h a g r i n of his c o n s e r v a t i v e
rivals, blasted into environmental action. In
his final week of office he created six new
national monuments. While technically not
the most heavily protected lands in the USA
(national parks), national monuments are
heavily covered by environmental safeguards
and perhaps most importantly can be created
through the simple process of presidential
decree. It is for this reason that more than
I million acres of federal land in the west has
suddenly been thrown off limits to industry
and developers.
These national monuments are only the final

Republicans are very upset over what they
consider an outright abuse of the executive
office (my heart is breaking). However, Bush
has remained silent. The only commentary
from his camp on these issues has come from
his s p o k e s m a n S c o t t M c C l e l l a n , " W e are
reviewing all eleventh-hour executive orders,
rules and regulations and will make decisions
after P r e s i d e n t - e l e c t B u s h is s w o r n into
office. The president-elect believes in a bal-
anced approach to our environment that is
based on working closely with s t a t e s and
local communities."
A Mir six weeks
The Russian Government has set a date of
March 6th for the destruction of the veteran
Mir space station. It follows an eventful fif-
teen years, including a variety of fires, crash-
es and computer failiures, and most recently
all c o n t a c t with the s t a t i o n w a s lost on
Christmas Day. In recent years the Russians
have come under increasing pressure from
Nasa to scuttle the craft and concentrate
their thin r e s o u r c e s on the International
Space Station, Alpha.
An unmanned supply ship is due to dock with
the s t a t i o n t o d a y in o r d e r to r e f u e l it,

automatic docking does not go as planned. In
March, the station's thrusters will be fired in
order to take it down into the thicker atmos-
phere, where it is expected to break up. Most
of the pieces should burn up in the atmos-
p h e r e , with the larger o n e s e x p e c t e d to
splash down in the Pacific Ocean.
However, there are few guarantees that the
operation will go as planned. Russian scien-
tists s a y that they are confident it will go
ahead without any faults, but the only com-
parable operation in S p a c e history is the
deorbiting of S k y l a b in the 1 9 7 0 s , which
resulted in an exhilarating f e w hours for
much of the Southern Hemisphere, before
the Station finally hit part of the Australian
outback. With the C h r i s t m a s D a y incident
fresh in their minds, few people are dismiss-
ing the possibility that M i r has one or two
surprises left for the world.
