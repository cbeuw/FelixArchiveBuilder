Ladies, gentlemen and any androgenous creatures the Biotech-
nology department produced in the past few days, here is a n
e
w
crossword for you to complete. I have modelled the colour
scheme this week on a motor-racing finishing flag for all y
o

sports enthusiasts.
In my infinite generosity, I have also placed a bumper set ol
answers on the left for your reference, for your enjoyment and for
your use as emergency toilet paper.
Unfortunately 1193 was a bit of a farce, but my lesson h
a
s
been learned: I shall no longer rely on technology to transmit m
y
crosswords lest they are garbled into the mess you saw before
you a couple of weeks ago. Instead, I shall in future use a qui'
and parchment. I've got somebody chasing after a peacock as v»8
speak. However, despite the total disregard for accuracy and lit-
eracy that 1193 represented, many still managed to decipher the
puzzle. Of those people, very few actually submitted their
answers, so an item from the Editor's Christmas stocking goesB
Simon Coulson and Jan Patchett, who have to fight over son*
posters. I know who'll win.
The prize for this week is again something from the Felix go01
*
ie bag which I know will excite you all immensely. If it doesn1
then I suppose your time would be better spent darning socks0
'
solving fourteenth order differential equations, whichever you
fine
the harder. Of course, you could also consult Guru Gi
guidance on how to use your spare time, or indeed a copy
Radio Times which is bound to provide better film reviews,
haps a solution for your boredom that isn't altogether go1
your eyesight. I am the weakest link. Goodbye. Wailer Ned
