pears over teaching quality as lecturers go to balance books
|tOM A N D E R S O N
I ast Tuesday lunchtime over 100 Geology students
L—.filled a lecture theatre in order to voice their con-
cerns about the offer of early retirement to seven key
academic staff and the resulting ramifications on the
course and department. Speaking to them was first
Stephanie Dawson ( R S M U President), Emily Procter
(Geology Dept Rep) and Eleanor Clifford (RSMU Vice
President), and later Professor Beddington, head of the
T.H. Huxley School, and other academic staff.
The seven staff were offered early retirement not only
in an effort to cut costs but also to achieve a higher rat-
ing in an impending Research Assessment Exercise,
which is critical to the amount of money that flows into
the department. The exercise begins on the 1st of
April, and not surprisingly the staff have to leave by
31st of March. A letter was sent to the seven lecturers
at the end of last year with the leaking of the informa-
tion to the student body soon after.
The students gathered voiced concerns regarding the1
course, especially with regard to the lack of contin
gency plans. The most concerning issue is that the 11
staff involved are being coerced to leave by the
|1st March 2001, particularly untimely, since;
is in the middle of an academic year
Students were unsure whether they would be
fele to get advice during the exam peri-
g i g ;
and the resulting extra burden on their time. N o
replacements will be found for the seven and thus
existing academic staff will have to be involved in
teaching. Whether they want to or not, or, of greater
concern to students, are capable seems to be of no
importance.
T.H Huxley School was formed during 1998 with the
fusion of the departments of G e o l o g y and Earth
R e s o u r c e Engineering and the C e n t r e for
Environmental Technology. The two departments had
over the years accumulated a deficit that was written
off with the formation of the School, though since
1998, a £1.5 million loss has accumulated. Action to
correct this has been forced by College's Management
and Planning Group with the loss of academic staff
(staff being the greatest expenditure of the College) in
addition to the previous reductions in clerical and sup-
port staff and space saving measures.
Later in the day, Imperial C o l l e g e Union C o u n c i l
entered into a long debate about what was occurring in
the School with one member describing the issue as
^ ^ " t h e most important paper in years." The debate
was marked by concerns that this would happen to
other loss-making departments, especially after
•xjthe Medical School redundancies last year. It was
questioned whether this would be a regular solu-
tion, as that a number of departments are in deficit.
Following this Council mandated its

Ince the staff setting the exams and avenues to fight for the students
ping the courses may not be marking the papers. studying Geology to ensure their education is not dam-
pere are several final year students with projects
ping supervised by one of the seven and these stu-
fcits have been particularly worried. Dr. Worthington,
Iformer head of department for Geology (in pre-T.H.
Pxley days), corrected Professor Beddingto" over his
Ingestion of new projects being initiated, to inform
("dents that another supervisor would be found. An
Plitional worry is the loss of fieldwork supervisors.

from low student morale, staff also are being
I c t e
d , with many unhappy about losing colleagues
aged in any way.
The overall impression given to students is that their
degrees are being jeopardised due to financial misman-
agement, which is not in their control. The situation in
Geology highlights discrepancies in the funding of uni-
versities by the Government. Essentially if a depart-
ment receives a high grading in a Research Evaluation
A s s e s s m e n t it receives a large financial reward.
However the quality of teaching does not provide any
extra financial rewards. Thus inactive research staff
lower the grade of the research assessment which in
turn affects the finances of the departments. Therefore
"research inactive" lecturers, despite maybe being
excellent teachers are the first to be sacrificed. This
descripancy highlights the situation in Universities
across the country, where Government funding meth-
ods indisputably show that research has become a
financial priority above undergraduate studies.
