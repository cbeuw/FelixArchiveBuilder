Students and Supplementary Benefit
A s many of you will be
aware students are at the
present time able to claim
supplementary Benefit from the
local Department of Health and
Social Security during the
vacations. Many students
rely on this, e s p e c i a l l y those
with flats who c a n have their
vacation rent paid for them.
I want to emphasise for a l l
those students who do not
claim this benefit that it is a
right which you are a l l entitled.
How much longer this right
w i l l remain i s a matter of
conjecture. Rumours have
been rife for sometime now
that this provision w i l l be
stopped. Recent statements
point to the fact that it i s
now more imminent than before.
Why should students receive
this supplementary benefit?
Under the present grant
conditions where a student i s
paid only for 30 weeks of the
year at the full rate, and
receives about £70 to cover
the 22 weeks of vacation,
students simply cannot survive
without extra income during
those vacations. N o w , I am
not against students working
during the vacations, a s this
can provide useful experience,
it is not possible however, to
work every week of a l l the
vacations. I a l s o feel that
students should not be seperated
off from the rest of the community
and if they are unemployed
then they should be treated
in the same way a s anyone
e l s e would b e .
I would therefore adopt the
attitude that a student should
either be paid for 52 weeks
of the year, or should be
subject to the same rules as
everyone e l s e , that i s , if they
are unable to get a job they
should receive some support
from the state. I hope that
you agree.
Who wants a higher grant?
The answer to that question
is probably that most students
want a higher grant. T h e
N U S grants campaign h a s three
main fronts. F i r s t l y , that the
Carental contribution should
e abolished because students
should be independent at
eighteen a s is everyone e l s e ,
and a l s o it is the only way
to ensure that every student
receives the full grant to
which they are entitled.
Secondly, that those awards
which l o c a l authorities make
at their discretion at present,
should be mandatory s o that
any student who i s accepted
for a course automatically
receives financial support.
F i n a l l y , the N U S are campaign-
ing for an increase in the
level of the grant of about
33%. T h i s increase seems
m a s s i v e , but i s necessary
to give students the same
purchasing power they had in
1962. T h e grant level would
be over £1,000 a year if this
increase were accepted by
the D E S . T o put this into
perspective the . residence
charges at Westfietd C o l l e g e
are £620 full board.
I hope you will a l l agree
that although we should be
grateful for what grant we
get, in a time of high inflation
large annual increases are
