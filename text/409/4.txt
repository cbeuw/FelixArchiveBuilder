Disaffiliation Debate-An Apolitical
National Student Organisation
Students, who have found,
e s p e c i a l l y s i n c e the latest
Rent A c t made landlords
more fussy as to their tenants,
this reputation a mill stone
be important", but you C A N
stop them expressing their
views in the name of an
organisation by making it
plain that the views are purely
the personal opinions of the
individual who makes them.
A n a t i o n a l student organisation
which i s , by its constituition,
unable to hold political views,
would be a solution to this
problem.
Ms Attenborough assumes
In her letter that there can
be only one union, the N U S ,
representing students nationally.
Why shouldn't c o l l e g e s
disaffiliate from the N U S and
form their own National Union?
— An apolitical national union.
An apolitical union would
be in the student interest, since
it is the political views of the
N U S executive which has
done much, in recent years,
to tarnish the reputation of
around their necks whilst
looking for accommodation.
To say nothing of no longer
having to finance joy-rides
to Bucharest for conference
delegates.
There are two ways of
getting an apolitical student
organisation. One is by
amending the N U S cons titution,
which would prove difficult
because of the large number
of " p o l i t i c i a n s " in influential
places there; the other is
by disaffiliating from the
N U S and setting up another
apolitical national organisation
along with Aston and any others
which may decide to d i s a f f i l i a t e .
The new national union could
provide a l l the f a c i l i t i e s now
provided by N U S . In the event
of the new organisation
failing we could a l w a y s
rejoin the N U S .
Yours faithfully,

As mandated
Sir, — Mary Attenborough's
letter in your ast edition,
revolved about two themes on
which I would like to comment.
Her two points were, (i) T h e
need for an organisation to
represent Student interests
on a national level; (ii)
Concern of students about the
world situation.
Considering the need for
a national student organisation,
when she says "If you want
to change anything at a l l ,
though, you must see the
need for a student organisation.
It would be impossible to
even decide on the grants
claim...without some sort of
national c o - o r d i n a t i o n " . She
makes a very valid point.
There is a need for an
organisation to represent
S T U D E N T I N T E R E S T S at a
national level. What is important
is the definition of student
interests. In which areas should
a student organisation express
its v i e w s on our behalf,
and in which areas should
its jurisdiction be curtailed?
Disgust
Sir, — It was with great disgust
that I read your front page
article entitled "Wonderland
M a s c o t r y " in the last edition
of F E L I X (No 408). I refer
to of course, the numerous
factual errors contained
within it.
The idea was fhfact not
mine as was stated! I was
approached as to the p o s s i b i l i t y
of a swop and subsequently
as requested informed Steve
Brightman (RCSU President)
and asked for his comments.
Meanwhile Steve H o y l e ( C & G U
President) was also informed
and both presidents were
given four days to think it
over. A s you can see it was
not just implemented but
careful consideration was
given to the S T U N T before
we went ahead, the opposite
was i m p l i e d by 'your'
article.
Eventually both sides
agreed leaving Richard
Gundersen (not Gunnersby and
not a Spanner Bearer)to f i n a l i s e
d e t a i l s of the swop. We
eventually met at 1.01 (46
minutes late of the original
12.15 deadline) as both had
slight mishaps.
I a l s o find that certain
parts of the ' T I T B I T S ' article
need commenting upon. I am
quite sure that the reference
to C h a l k i e White (RCSU V P )
were most embarassing to him,
as he is 'in charge' of R C S U
Ms Attenborough c l a i m s that
"If you don't want higher
grants, if you don't mind
educational c u t b a c k s , if
you don't care about the
economic situation in B r i t a i n ,
and if you don't care what
happens in other parts of the
world, you may as well leave
the N U S " .
The first two topics she
lists 1 believe are in the
domain of a national student
organisation, whereas the
latter two are well beyond
its b o u n d s . A student
organisation should look
after our interests as students,
we elect M P s to look after
our interests in the field
of p o l i t i c s .
In fact, the whole controversy
is about the P O L I T I C A L
VIEWS and P O L I C I E S expressed
by the N U S and N O T their
a c t i v i t i e s in other f i e l d s .
Ms Attenborough states
rightly that " Y o u cannot
stop people from wanting to
consider and express views
about any issue they feel to
mascotry but the Theta
Bearers are responsible
for Theta!
Yours sincerely,
D A V E D O D G E
R C S U Theta Bearer.
Delight
Sir, - We the undersigned,
the R C S U executive, hereby
carry out our mandate by
informing you of a motion
passed, by a small majority,
at the last R C S U G M . The
m o t i o n noted the S e x
been mandated to inform the
F E L I X Editor of this, and
also the Equal Opportunities
Board.
Having stated this, we the
undersigned, being cowardly,
rush to seek shelter from the
wrath of ICWA which w i l l
i n e v i t a b l y follow the
publication of this letter,
Your ever humble servants,

President
J O H N WHITE
V i c e President

Honorary Secretary
H a l l 'Student House (who but
the C h a p l a i n c y would put a
nun into L instead for a week.
During the week various
a c t i v i t i e s w i l l be taking place
in your H a l l ; look out for them
A c t i v i t i e s for the whole
C o l l e g e include the C h a p l a i n c y
Communion Service on Sunday
(10.00am in the Consort

(Tues 7.30pm. Union) and a
C o n v i v i a l i t y with worship
(Thurs 7.30pm, Union).
H a n d b i l l s and posters w i l l
be around (try lining the wpb
with them).
Sir, — I am delighted to see
the reappearance of the
' T I T B I T S ' column this term.
It w i l l I am sure provide
some stimulus for interesting
reaction and lively debate.
I note that the authors
express a desire for anonymity
'per se' the furtherance of
'journalistic mobility'. However
if one. is prepared to express
opinions publicly then one
must be prepared to accept
any criticism arising from
them. Therefore I ask you
to urge the authors of ' T I T B I T S '
to reveal t h e i r identities.
Yours faithfully,
C G M I L L E R
P h y s i c s I.
(THIS L E T T E R stimulated
reaction and lively debate
amonst the Editorial Board
at the meeting last Monday.
The outcome was sympathy
with Mr M i l l e r ' s point, and his
view was appreciated. Never-
theless, we must, as yet, keep
the identity of Titbits columnist
under the E d i t o r ' s Hat. Any
c r i t i c i s m s , or praise, arising
from the column w i l l be accepted
by the Editorial Board, whose
ui&ui iininctuuu rtui, nuw law
and a l s o the existence within
IC of an organisation, namely
ICWA, which was believed to
be s e x i s t . The articles of
constitution of this organisation
include the denial of membershi|
to male persons with the
exception of the s e x i s t post
of Mr ICWA. Hence we have
Contact Week
Next week the West London
C h a p l a i n c y i s holding its
annual Contact Week.
The C h a p l a i n c y w i l l be
host to a c o l l e c t i o n of
theological students, v i c a r s
and nuns who w i l l be available
to meet students and d i s c u s s
any aspects of Christianity
with them.
There w i l l be a member of
the team staying in each
choice permits the inclusion of
each s p e c i f i c point raised.
We would a l s o appreciate
further correspondence on this
matter. — Editorial Board.)
