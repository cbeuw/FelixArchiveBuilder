T H E ' SNOW L A Y thick last
Sunday as the Orienteering
C l u b ventured forth to the
icy wastes of Berkshire.
Gallowstree Common was the
v e n u e for the ' C h i Item
Challenge' Badge Event.
Captain David Rosen ran
hard to come third on the
12.8 kilometre course in
72 minutes. He had the
satisfaction of knowing that
he was beaten by two good
men; both are e x - B r i t i s h
Champions. A l s o , he avenged
last weeks defeat by A l i s t a i r
D o y l e , the University Captain,
who this week was slower by
10 minutes.
A l a n Leakey once more
proved that experience is
more important than running
speed by coming in 9 minutes
clear erf Rob- A l t i n s o n . The
course was a fast flat one
and Rob had plenty of opportunity
to stretch his long legs. With
a bit more orienteering speed
(rather than running speed),
he should soon be coming
higher up — A l a n will h a v e to
do some training Jo keep up!
Steve Web.b could a l s o be a
force to reckon with in the
future; he did better this
week pipping Pete Johnson
•by 5 minutes.
John Gibbirfs, the club
treasurer, looked resplendent
in his newly purchased
orienteering kit (he denies
all rumours that it was bought
with club funds). He completed

T H E A ' s B A D L Y wanted to
win this game. The reason
they did not, was a depleted
pack. Four of the regular
forwards had departed, for one
reason or another.
The A ' arrived at Harlington
without a referee, the job
having be^n declined by
everyone who was approached.
U C arrived with an extra
player and suggested that
he should play for the A ' s
while an A player refereed.
Steve Downing readily agreed.
He had seen the snow and

his nether regions as to make

M Isles and A R o s s , and
the wing-halves Kim " F l i c k e r "
Howden and J Andrews who
distinguished themselves
in their adriot distribution,
only produced Chas Hardy
style finishing. T h i s meant
that when the opposition
made their first attack and
scored, IC had not yet troubled
the scorer. T h i s is a not
unfamiliar situation to the
the 8 kilometre course along
with Mike Welford and Len
Faircett. Martin K e s s l e r
was not so lucky, getting
totally lost and only completing
half the course. However, he
showed that his orienteering
s k i l l is not entirely absent
by s u c c e s s f u l l y locating the
pub before c l o s i n g time.
He claims that if all the
controls smelled of beer,
he'd have no trouble.
From now on, the orienteering
club meets every Friday lunch-
time at 12.30pm in Beit 57.
There will be a cheap bread
and cheese lunch available
and everyone is welcome to
drop in for a chat and a bite
to eat.

appealed to him. That, however,
depleted the pack still further
and was to ensure the A ' s
downfall. While the forwards
were still trying to get them-
s e l v e s organised U C scored,
and they were to score again
in the first half, but not
before they coped with a
lot of pressure from the A ' s .
Half-time arrived with the
A ' s 10—0 down.
There was a revival in the
second half with the pack —
e s p e c i a l l y the second row —
playing better. John Fishburn
twice came c l o s e to scoring.
(At half time it had been
decided to give the backs
another
first team, and their response
this time w a s a revelation.
A b a l l , from the defence
to Bob "where can I get my
leg s y n c h r o n i s e d ? " Middleton
was passed on to Trevor
Tutu, who found M Isles
moving cleverly into space.
Mike "I can score from
anywhere, but short-corners"
Isles had no trouble in going
round the ful Iback and hammering
the ball past the charging
goal keeper.
The next goal came from a
neat ball into the ' D ' . The
attack was constructed on
the right wing by John. "I

timing at the run left Trevor

only the goalkeeper to flick
past. N o one m i s s e s those.

team set off for the w i l d s of
Potters Bar. By the time the
thirds a r r i v e d at their
destination, it had commenced
snowing and during the match
they were treated to flurries
of snow, sleet and hail I
Potters Bar 3rd XI stood
no chance against the IC
team who proceeded to tear
them apart from the bully-off.
Within ten minutes they had
conceeded a short corner. A
good hand-stop by N i c k B e l l
enabled C h r i s Parker to put
the ball in the net, and five
minutes later, N i c k scored as
w e l l . Our latest recruit,
lain Stirling, proved himself by
scoring our third goal.
The second half was similar
to the first but we scored
more goals. The first of these
more of the ball and so to
exploit U C ' s bad covering and
that proved to be pretty
successful.) U C scored a
breakaway try. The ball went
down field leading to a ruck
on the A ' s line. A U C forward
exploited the lack of cover
and scored. The A ' s fought
back. C h r i s Becque worked
hard and received h i s reward
when he ran In a try from the
25 (yard) line following a
mistake by the U C ' s backs.
D i c k P u l l e n kicked the
conversion. D i c k had been
having a good game at full
back, kicking calmly under
pressure.
T h i s was another disappoint-
ing result for the A ' s . If the
forwards had been able to
match the backs the A ' s could
pint
pockets Tutu refused to
claim for financial reasons,
came from a push in by John
Andrews who played the
ball into Trevor Tutu's path.
He noticed the goal-keeper
off h i s line waiting for the
c r o s s . T h e shot was deflected
by the g o a l i e ' s pads into the
net.
Charlie " B a l l o n F e e t "
Brown couldn't let the game
go by without making a ghastly
error to eliminate his otherwise
excellent play, so he let in a
short-corner. But such w a s

w a s a penalty which C h r i s
Parker managed to convert
(unlike last week). The fifth
goal was put in by lain Stirling,
a player of sterling q u a l i t i e s .
Our last two goals were scored
by Paul K u r o w s k i , the second
of these being an excellent
solo effort.
A l l through the game, Potters
Bar did not get a serious
shot at goal thanks to a
very competent defence. T h i s
was another well deserved
vistory. The only grouses were
that no " J u g s " were scored
and that the onset of cold
weather had resulted in the
reappearance of C h r i s P a r k e r ' s
deadly-smelling horse liniment.
