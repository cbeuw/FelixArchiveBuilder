T H E MOST interesting thing to
come out of the C C U debates
on the N U S , was the consensus
that " w e must work hard and
democratically to make N U S
what we want it to be instead
of sitting on our b a c k s i d e s " .
So I hope that we shall see
well attended Union meetings
to d i s c u s s m o t i o n s and
amendments f o r N U S c o n f e r e n c e s ,
and a few more people standing
'or conference delegations.
N U S — no impact
I was interested to read
Mary Attenborough's letter
in The last issue of F E L I X .
I am sure that most students
would agree her statement
that our main need is " a n
organisation to represent
our interests and views at a
national l e v e l " . But as R i z
Shakir said last week, the
NUS has not had much
impact in the corridors of
power. I would suggest that
this is because the N U S is
not believed to be genuinely
representative of students.
In order to give it real
power, we must do three
things; (a) democratise the
Union at all levels, and that
includes democratising our
own Union! (b) change the
Union from a federal structure
to a union of individual members;
(c) stop it wasting time and
money campaigning on i s s u e s
not of direct relevance to
students; for e x a m p l e ,
international affairs, revolutions,
and telling the Government
how to run the country.
A l l three are c l o s e l y
interrelated, and if we are
not prepared to work hard to
achieve them, then we might
as well join those Unions
such as Manchester, St Andrews,
St D a v i d s and Newcastle
Who are expected to leave
NUS very soon, and those
such as Aston and Charing
C r o s s H o s p i t a l Medical
School who have already done
so. Some people are suggesting
that we set up an alternative
Union; but I think it is more
r e a l i s t i c to do something with
the one w e already have.
'Broad Right' needed
The only way that change
can be realised is through
building up a political machine
as powerful as that of the
Broad Left (the dominant
political bloc in N U S ) , which
is obviously not something
we can do over - night. In
In every college in Britain,
Communists and other Marxists
w i l l have to be opposed in
e l e c t i o n s for union posts and
for conference delegations, by
Independents, L i b e r a l s and
C o n s e r v a t i v e s . T h e s e people
must then produce a network
similar to that of the Broad
Left but working for a relevant
NUS and through that a better
deal for students.
Democracy — two types
F i n a l l y , I would like to
say something about the
meaning of " d e m o c r a c y " .
E s s e n t i a l l y there are two
contradictory concepts which
must not be confused in
student politics or elsewhere;
firstly, there is " a c t i v e
d e m o c r a c y " , as advocated
by Mary Attenborough and
her p a r t y . In an " a c t i v e
d e m o c r a c y " , a l l d e c i s i o n s
are taken by " a c t i v i s t s " ,
that i s , by meetings such as
Union G e n e r a l Meetings
attended by a small proportion
of the population. Hence it
follows that in a Student
U n i o n , all officers would be
elected by such meetings
and could only act when
Equality-what the law says
We may all know what
happened on 29th December
last year, but how does it
affect us? Perhaps you are
applying for jobs or for a
postgraduate course or even
looking for somewhere to
live. If so, the Sex Discrimination
and Equal Pay A c t s could
help you.
Employment and Advertising
Employers can no longer
discriminate against a person
on the grounds of sex, either
in recruitment or, if you get
the job, in training or promotion.
R e m e m b e r , discrimination
against a person because they
are married is also illegal
in employment. J o b advertise-
ments that in any way favour
instructed by a meeting.
In opposition to this is
"representative d e m o c r a c y " ,
under which officers are
elected by a ballot in which
everyone may vote and once
"elected may take d e c i s i o n s
on their own initiative. However,
the latter system does not
prevent o f f i c e r s being
accountable to a General
Meeting, as is the situation
at IC.
At many c o l l e g e s , the
sovereign body is not the
General M e e t i n g , but a
Representative Council on
the Parliamentary model.
Probably such a council
would be preferable to the
present ICU C o u n c i l which
is mostly composed of officers
accountable to a General
M e e t i n g . T h i s is being
investigated by the Working
Party on Union R e s p o n s e .
Whatever may be decided,
I hope that the sovereignity
of the General Meeting w i l l
be retained, even if it is
only to be a safeguard, c a l l e d
in emergencies to debate
s p e c i f i c i s s u e s .
one particular sex are i l l e g a l .
There are a few mi nor except ion s.
Men and women must be paid
equally for doing the same
or an equivalent job.
Education
C o l l e g e s , U n i v e r s i t i e s and
C o - E d s c h o o l s c a n n o t
discriminate in their admissions
as from 1st September 1976.
Accommodation etc.
In general, you may not
be refused a place in a flat,
boarding house or hotel
because of your s e x . Neither
may you be refused service
in a restaurant. In obtaining
credit f a c i l i t i e s and mortgages
you must be offered the same
terms as would be given to
someone of the opposite sex.
The E q u a l Opportunities
Commission
The C o m m i s s i o n was set up
as watch dog over the rein-
f o r c e m e n t of the Sex
Discrimination and E q u a l
P a y A c t s . It i s also empowered
to make recommendations to
the government on • e x i s t i n g
law. It w i l l advise people of
their rights and over major
i s s u e s it may help an individual
to bring a c a s e . T h e C o m m i s s i o n
can set up its own formal
investigations and, when
necessary, i s s u e non-
discrimination notices.
Bringing complaints
T h i s can be done through
the county courts or by an
industrial tribunal in employment
c a s e s . Advertising complaints,
are dealt with only by the
C o m m i s s i o n . E m p l o y m e n t
complaints must be brought
within three months and
others within s i x .
