An introduction to a discussion on the Origin of the Family, Private Property
and the State by Frederick Engels.
THIS B O O K alms to show that the
Institutions of society are n e c e s s a r i l y
linked with its economic b a s i s , because
of this, both the family as we know it
today, and the state have not a l w a y s
e x i s t e d . Much of E n g e l s ' facts are
taken f r o m L H Morgan's " A n c i e n t
S o c i e t y " (1877).
He begins by looking at the different
kinds of early society and noting that
they are differentiated only by the
methods of production of food and basic'
n e c e s s i t i e s . There were three b a s i c
stages;*
a) Savagery — where people lived off
nature as they found it, the only tools
used were to help in hunting eg bows
and arrows, spears etc.;
b) Barbarism — the beginning of organised
production of food with simple agriculture
and domestication of animals (where
suitable animals existed);
c) E a r l y c i v i l i s a t i o n — a very great leap
forward In amounts capable of being
produced. T h i s arose mainly out of
iron in agricultural tools eg ploughs,
w h i c h very much increased production.
In tracing the history of the family
through these stages of society it becomes
clear that the monogamous family has
not existed for a l l time nor has the
subjugation of women, inherent. In
our present family structure.
Forms of the family, or more strictly,
limitations of peoples with whom sexual
intercourse was permitted, initially
came about purely through the n e c e s s i t y
to reduce inbreeding. Those tribes that
practised such restrictions grew in
strength through natural s e l e c t i o n . In
the very early stages marriage groups
would be ranged according to generations
such that brother and sister would be in
the same group and able to have sexual
intercourse but not parents and children.
Later structures were more complicated
with gens (or extended families) within
a tribe based initially on "mother
r i g h t " . T h e s e gens consisted of descend-
ants on the females side and sexual
intercourse or pairing marriage was not
allowed within them. T h u s , one gens
could take partners from some other gens
but not from its own and because of
this structure the gens was regarded as
the immediate family. Thus a man would
regard his sisters children as nearer
relatives that h i s own children, infact,
as it was not necessary for paternity to
be known, descent was only recognised
through the female line. I
Within this system pairing marriage
existed but of q u i t e a lose nature.
Monogamy w a s not forced upon the
women and a marriage could be broken
off by either side with relative e a s e .
Preparation of food, rearing of children
and living accommodation were often
organised communially.
A s the means of agricultural production
developed into the stage of early c i v i l i z -
ation, there became a surplus from
production, over and above the b a s i c
needs for s u r v i v a l , and private wealth
existed for the first time.
T h e man had always been the one
actively involved in production although
before that time the d i v i s i o n of labour
between male and female had not been
degrading, it was merely a natural
occurence. Now wealth became the
p o s s e s s i o n of a man through production
and he wished to pass this on through
h i s family to h i s children. Then came
" f a t h e r r i g h t " within the gens structure.
A woman would leave her gens to marry
and would as time persisted be required
to keep chaste before marriage and
could be punished for adultery.
Prostitution and adultery (on the
part of the male) however, went side
by side with the m o n o g a m y . The
monogamous family, In many w a y s , w a s
the greatest defeat for womankind
because It degraded her to the level
of a mere p o s s e s s i o n .
The necessity to protect wealth also
brought about the development of the
state. Under the orr,ainsation of barbarism
a l l members of the tribe took part In
d e c i s i o n making, chiefs-would usually be
f i g u r e h e a d s with most d e c i s i o n s
c o l l e c t i v e l y made.
However, as uneven growth led to a
few growing r i c h , often taking p o s s e s s i o n
of the Jands of others, it lead to a stage
in society when the wealth of the few had
to be protected for the poor. T h i s led to
a " p o l i c e " f o r c e and other state
institutions to be used, not for the
common good, but to protect the priviliged
within the society against the under-
p r i v i l i g e d .
T h i s is a very brief sketch of the
fascinating ideas contained in this
book. E n g e l s draws on examples from
American Indians, Australian aborigines
and from early Roman Greek and the
Germanic tribes organisation.
H e highlights how, as commodity
production developed, economic forces
and laws of production often seem to rule
over humankind and looks forward to
a stage of society when humans w i l l
truly control their own lives — when
the family ceased to be an economic
unit and becomes an expression of
" i n d i v i d u a l sex l o v e " , when the state
w i l l no longer be necessary as an organ
of oppression of one c l a s s by another
and all d e c i s i o n s on the organisation of
society can be taken by communities for
the good of the whole community.
