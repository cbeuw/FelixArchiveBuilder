Education
A N E M O T I V E start maybe, but what is it
all about? L a s t year saw the release of,
three reports on Postgraduate e d u c a t i o n /
training by the S R C (Science Research
Council), the C V C P L Committee of
V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r s and P r i n c i p a l s ) and the
P E C L Parliamentary Expenditure
Committee). It is likely that these
reports w i l l be acted upon this year
If this action involves implementation of
the recommendations per s e , then what
effect w i l l it have on our education
system?
The debate in the Houses of Parliament
on the P E C report brought out many of
the o l d c r i t i c i s m s of postgraduate study,
v i z : -
(i) Postgraduate work is rarely orientated
towards the current needs of society or
industry;
(ii) Postgraduates, e s p e c i a l l y in research,
are educated too narrowly to be suited
for industry afterwards; and
(iii) A loan financed grant system
would " t e s t the motivations of post-
g r a d u a t e s " .
The values of postgraduate education
to the individual and to the education
system were sadly under-expressed.
A loan system would indeed test
motivations; 99% of P G s would be
severely deterred by the thought of
entering the big bad world with a £6000
plus debt round their n e c k s .
Both the S R C and P E C overlook the
fact that university research is the
foundation stone of our whole educational
system which continually adds to the
wealth of knowledge available to future
generations.
The S R C put forward prosposals for
broadening postgraduate studies and
even providing a " t a u g h t " course to
postgraduate l e v e l . They conclude from
their s t a t i s t i c s that s i n c e 60% of science
and engineering P G s finish, up in Govern-
ment and Industrial research, these areas
have the highest demand for P G s and
therefore P G studies should be structured
around the needs of these areas. The
ICU
The A c a d e m i c Affairs committee
sent a response to the S R C last term
contructi vely c r i t i c i s i n g the findings
of their report. A response to the C V C P
report is now being prepared.
IC
A C o l l e g e working party on postgraduates
(with three P G members) d i s c u s s e d the
C V C P report and came down in favour
of reductions in the number of grants to
increase the value of awards. A n alarming
S R C also c a l l s for an increase of the
number of industrial co-operative awards
at the expense of normal grants.
A research student of the future may
be a s s e s s e d on productivity rather than
academic gualify and a project w i l l
need j o b / c o s t justification rather
than educational merit. Surely a l l
postgraduate education should be
primarily an education and not a vocational
training nor a way of producing industrially
useful research on the cheap.
The C V C P report is a more liberal
document and tries to cover the whole
spectrum of postgraduate education. It
defends research against outside
encroachment and c a l l s for a higher
level of grant for postgraduates (the
latter at the expense of the number of
awards available). It attacks the present
education cuts but only in so far a s they
are affecting u n i v e r s i t i e s . It is about
time bodies like the C V C P put their
foot down with a firm hand to stop cuts in
all parts of education. If these cuts
continue it is unlikely that the availability
and quality of education for our own
children w i l l be a s good a s it is now.
The C V C P also defends the differential
of fees tor overseas students providing
" f e e s are not a s large a s to make study
in this country more expensive than in
Europe or A m e r i c a " . Some European
countries have no university fees and
many much lower fees with no differential.
There are many good arguments for a l l
education being centrally funded.
view for such a prominent research
establishment to take. It a l s o remained
non-commital on the subject of overseas
students fees.
N U S
Sue Slipman (NUS National Secretary)
has had publicity this year oyer the
direction of a very small proportion of
the vast amount of work she has done for
NUS. She h a s , however, been very
active in the field of postgraduate
education and is generally in favour
of firmer and more concrete policy from
NUS on Education a s a whole.
L a s t F r i d a y , she chaired a meeting
of the Postgraduate Advisory Group of
which I am a member. We d i s c u s s e d the
reports and the form of our response. Sue
affirmed that it would be u s e l e s s to
simply c r i t i c i s e the reports and that we
must produce a response laying down
clearly student views on the whole
field of P G education and directions we
would like it to take. In short, the
Advisory Group is to prepare the N U S
report on postgraduate education. Your
comments a s P G s or prospective P G s would
be welcome.
;i) Fight the education cuts. March on
February 27th to show that you wish
to preserve and increase, for future and
present generations, the a v a i l a b i l i t y
and quality of education.
(ii) Support the campaign against the
present fees situation which c a u s e s
hardship for many students and makes
study Impossible for others. Campaign for
100% central funding of education.
(iii) H e l p N U S to prepare a reasonable
and representative report by s a y i n g b y
giving your opinions.

Photographs - Resin paper only!
In future a l l photographs submitted for publication either
in F E L I X or on posters, programmes etc, should be printed on
resin coated paper. P r i n t s should p o s s e s normal contrast with
fuli b l a c k s and a minimum of tone i n the highlights.
These measures are being implemented to avoid the
unnecessary trouble caused when making p l a t e s dne to
prints made on a paper base or of poor contrast.
