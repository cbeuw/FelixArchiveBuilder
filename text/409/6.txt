••••••••••••••••••****************** •^•^•^^•••••••••••••••••^•^
R E N A I S S A N C E A R E one of those
handful of bands to which the o l d saying
about 'prophets i n their own land' more
than aptly a p p l i e s .
F o r some time n o w , they have been
one of the top box—office draws in
A m e r i c a , yet for the majority of their
existence they have been largely ignored
in their native B r i t a i n . Whilst always
having a consistant hard-core following,
its only in the last twelve months — with
the release of Turn of the Cards' a n d
the excellent 'Scheherazade' that B r i t i s h
audiences have come to appreciate
the subtle blending o f traditional folk
melodies with c l a s s i c a l influences,
while s t i l l sticking to the ever flexable
rock genre. N o w one feels i t ' s only a
matter of time (and money) before the
bard are enjoying the sort of full-blown
s u c c e s s that thev have achieved for
themselves in the States
Annie — "The Press didn't want to know us"
Beginnings
Renaissance was first conceived
as long ago as 1969, evolving around
two ex-Yardbirds, Keith R e l f and J i m
McCarty, a bass player named L o u i s
Cennamo, keyboard player John Hawken
and R e l f s sister Jane handling the
v o c a l s . T h i s M k l version made one
album. Kings and Queens' d i d a handful
of B r i t i s h gigs, one Stateside tour
and then seemed to disintergrate, leaving
only Sister Jane and John Hawken to
p"ick up the p i e c e s . Enter one Michael
Dunford, who had known Hawken since
their days together playing i n the
semi-legendary N a s h v i l l e T e e n s . Together
they managed to fomi a six-piece band to
finish off a second album that they
were recording when R e l f and McCarty
quit. However, the record company
would have nothing to do with the
M k l l R e n a i s s a n c e and i n s i s t e d that
the two ex-Yardbirds return and
participate in the recording. T h i s they
did, the consequence being a largely
forgettable record j due mostly to the
lialf-hearted contribution given by the
two. (lncidently, the second album
was never released in the States).
Changes
B y now disenchanted with the band,
Hawken soon left to be replaced by John
Tout, who had been playing with an
Irish folk-rock group. It w a s inevitable
I suppose that Jane R e l f too should
depart sooner o r later into obscurity,
and auditions were held to find a new
female v o c a l i s t . T h e lady they chose
had for the last s i x months been singing
in the Strand production of Showboat,
her first professional g i g . Immediately
the group r e a l i s e d that, potentially,
her beautiful soprano v o i c e might lead
them to the musical direction they h a d
been seeking. Her name w a s A n n i e
H a s l a m . T h e rhythm section then left,
to be replaced by John Camp, erstwhile
member of Leapy L e e ' s backing group
and Terry S u l l i v a n , a drummer of great
power and perception. T h i s then, one
might have thought was the most stable
line up the band w a s going to get — but
no. Just before R e n a i s s a n c e were going
into the studio to record 'Prologue',
Michael Dunford left, apparently to
concentrate on the acoustic guitar,
although he s t i l l contributed to the
group by way o f composition.
Crash
They found a fine new guitarist
named Mick P a r s o n s — who after celebrating
his new found j o b with the group, crashed
his c a r into a wall and d i e d . 'Prologue'
is dedicated to P a r s o n s .
There then followed a period with
the band using guitarist R o b Hendry, but
he didn't really fit in with the group's
by n o w , defined m u s i c a l ideology. At
a rehersal where Hendry failed to turn
up, former member Dunford stood in on
acoustic guitar and subsequently re-
joined at the expense of Hendry. It
is this line-up of Haslam, Tout, S u l l i v a n ,
Camp and Dunford that has t a k e n
R e n a i s s a n c e through the last three
albums, and that which played last
week at Brunei U n i v e r s i t y , where after
a highly s u c c e s s f u l gig 1 spoke to
Annie H a s l a m .
Natural P r o g r e s s i o n
I asked her firstly how she, thought
the music of R e n a i s s a n c e , h a d changed
since s h e joined the band. "Before 1
joined, the classical rock thing was
there. Bui their music was more boroque,
very flowery classical music, and we
changed it gradually into more dramatic
music, more emotional music, cause
thats the way we are as people. It
was just a natural progression. We
didn't sit down and think "right we're
going to play music like this". When
we do an album every one is different.
My voice changes from album to album,
probably because I'm getting older and
my voice is maturing everything progresses
naturally. We don't force anying because
I think that's where people go wrong.
Great American Success
To give you some idea just how
big the group arc in the States; they sell
out most p l a c e s they play (particularly
the E a s t C o a s t ) , last summer they filled
to capacity Carnegie H a l l three nights
on the trot..This with the Rollins; Stones
playing across town at the Garden . I
wondered why America had taken to the
band so readily, whilst their homeland
had seemingly procrastinated over the
music for so long. "At first the British
14> Annie — the vocal instrumentalist
press didn't want to know us, they
always had it against us" she complained,
"because we weren't the original
Renaissance". I think it w a s J a n
Akkerman who said that the reason why
America accepted European bands who
stuck c l o s e l y to their own musical
heritage, w a s because they (Americans)
had no real culture of their own and
-were w i l l i n g to " b u y instant c u l t u r e " .
D i d she go along with this thesis? "Yes
I think there might be some truth in.
that. They have no history, no real
classical roots to relate to bands like
ELF and Yes although" she adds,
"they're much different from ourselves,
have these roots. All their bands sound
the same".
Orchestra
The Carnegie- H a l l concerts were
recorded with orchestra for a double
album that should be released sometime
next month. H a v i n g used an orchestra
on a number of o c c a s i o n s in A m e r i c a ,
it seemed odd that R e n a i s s a n c e hadn't
lined up a prestige gig in this country
using one. where, incidently, she prefers
to work. "We've been told that it's
too expensive to do over here, but the
thing is I don't really like playing with
an orchestra. If you play with one you
have two or three days rehersal really
to get it absolutely perfect and its got to
be perfect otherwise its not worth doing,
and that costs an absolute fortune. It's
very difficult. I mean they don't always
play in tune, if the hall is hot everything
,goes out of tune anyway. I like playing
without actually, I mean, it's a nice
feel but usually your on stage and you
can't hear them, and they can't hear
you. You're worried all the time if they're
going to come in on time and in tune.
It's very difficult".
Old Grey Half Hour
A quick look at the datesheet shows
an abundance of University and C o l l e g e
gigs. Presumably they still think there
is a place for the c o l l e g e g i g o n the
big concert circuit, considering many
bands have priced themselves out of the
Ents Committees' budgets. " / think
people should do them" she emphasis,
/ don t mind doing college gigs, you
usually get treated very well, with a bit
of respect". While at I C the band are
being filmed for the ' O l d Grey Whistle
T e s t ' . D i d Annie have an opinion on
t e l e v i s i o n s only contempory music
outlet? She thinks for a moment —
"To tell you the truth, I don't like it.
There's no feeling in it. And when a
group plays in the studio, thank God
we're not doing it in the studio, it looks
as though you're standing in a telephone
box! The best thing about it is the
cartoons, they're great
Brunei G i g
Renaissance that night h a d played i n
the C o l l e g e sport's centre, a large
empty looking mass of brickwork, not
one might think t%- most i d y l l i c o f
settings for the romanticism that i s
so profound in their music. However, the
band adapted themselves well to the
o c c a s i o n and played with fine gusto, the
overall sound being a s good a s that
achieved in most concert h a l l s of
compatible s i z e . T h e songs played
stretched from the early 'Prologue'
album through to the latest Scheherazade'
concept. Starting with 7 can't understand',
from 'Ashes are Burning', and including
'Running Hard' 'Ocean Gypsy' and
'Prologue'. T h e only notable ommision
was 'Mother Russia', in my opinion
their best song. (Incidently, the song,
which concerns Alexander S o l z h e n i t z s y n ,
had to be dropped at one o f the Carnegie
H a l l concerts when half the staff of the
R u s s i a n Embassy turned up at the gig).
Annie — more emotional music
V o c a l Instrumentation
A s h a s been said before, A n n i e ' s
voice i s used a s an instrument rather
than just a method of reciting l y r i c s ,
often s i n g i n g i n unison with the
predominantly Eastern European piano
technique of John Tout. T h e up-front
bass of John Camp w a s used also
as part o f the melody line, rather than
just part of the foundation for the rest
to build o n . Indeed, on o c c a s i o n he
swamped the acoustic guitar playing o f
Michael Dunford. T h e swank drumming
of Terry S u l l i v a n , with i t s a s s u r e d
sense of space, i s used to tasteful
effect. He drove the band through the
changes of time and k e y . They were
given a fine ovation by the s i z e a b l e
attendence, and were brought back to
encore w i t h 'Ashes.are Burning'.
After finishing off their present
string o f dates the band are off on a
European tour co-heading with Tomita
followed, presumably, with another
lengthy tour of A m e r i c a . Shuffle along to
the Great H a l l on Saturday and catch
them while you c a n .
