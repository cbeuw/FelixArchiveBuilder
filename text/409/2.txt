THIS IS a s e r i e s of talks
arranged by some of the
women in college because
we felt a need to examine the
reason for women's present
position in our society. T h e
intention i s to look at the
present and past situation
of women, to s e e how it
affects u s , and possibly to
suggest what w e c a n d o
about it — although this i s
not our main a i m .
The meetings take the
form of a talk given by one
individual who h a s made a
s p e c i a l study of the subject.
We d o not pretend to be
experts, we just want to
share our interests with
others.
We shall be examining
women and work, women in
education, in the family, in
s c i e n c e and technology, and
in the church. We shall also
look at the historical aspects
of her role and society, and
her role in other s o c i e t i e s .
A full course outline w a s
given in F E L I X N o . 407.
The series started off with
a talk by Dot Griffiths on
S o c i a l i s a t i o n and Male and
Female R o l e s , on Wednesday
January 21st. In this interesting
talk s h e outlined experimental
biological differences, emphasis-
ing the tenuous assumptions
and experimental techniques on
which they are b a s e d . She
argued convincingly that the
apparent differences are
based on s o c i a l upbringing
not on the actual s e x of the
c h i l d , supporting this with
examples: one such a s the
c a s e of children miscategorized
as male or female at birth,
whose whole behavioural
pattern changed on being
r e c l a s s i f i e d . A s a result of
this talk, a lively d i s c u s s i o n
ensued; w e a l l thought that
the talk had been useful to
us, and looked forward to the
next one. o n
The talks are open to
everyone to attend, they
take place on Wednesday
lunchtimes at 12.30 in the
ICWA lounge. We hope to
see you there.
