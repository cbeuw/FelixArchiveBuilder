Theatre
RSC inject new insight
The Royal Shakespeare Company in "Henry V " at the Aldwych Theatre
IS T E R R Y H A N D S ' production to constitute
the R S C ' s last desperate plea to the
A r t ' s C o u n c i l ? It seems s o , for as the
audience arrive the cast are already on
stage, dressed casuaily in track-suits
or jeans and sweaters. They wave cheeri ly
to friends in the auditorium or wander
expectantly up and down as though
waiting for the pubs to open. But this
stark, s t a t i c beginning serves to
emphasis the splendour to follow. A s
if materialised out of thin air by Emrys
James' friendly and persuasive chorus,
costumes and props gradually appear;
first the gold c a s k e t , then gigantic
military equipment. A vast multicoloured
canopy depicts the court scenes, then
falls to represent the grey battle fields
of F r a n c e .
. . V i s u a l l y impressive though the
production is, the military and patristic
aspects of the play are toned down,
in favour of a closer examination of
the K i n g . A l a n Howard's Henry is a
young and inexperienced sovereign who,
mindful of his past, has to strive to
gain the trust of others. Great effort is
required to s u s t a i n the veneer of
kingship, and a number of lapses into
self pity and loss of confidence occur.
After Harfleur, Bardolph's execution
order and the list of the French dead,
we see Henry almost completely drained
of regality. E a c h time, however, command
returns almost as quickly a? it departed,
and Henry resumes his role as king.
Although little a s s i s t a n c e i s provided
by Shakespeare's text, Mr Howard
effects these and other subtleties very
convincingly. He possesses a remarkably
powerful and penetrating v o i c e , and
his delivery of the lines is riveting.
T h e s u c c e s s of any play cannot depend
s o l e l y on its central character; in this
production the R S C as a whole are in
excellent form. T R E V O R P E A C O C K
( F l u e l l e n ) , Richard Moore (Pistol) and
Geoffrey Hutchings (Danphin) provide
e s p e c i a l l y illuminating performances,
and the " F r e n c h " scenes with C a r o l l e
Roussean (Katharine and Yvonne
Coulette (Alice) are played with charm
and d e l i c a c y . Peter Bourke, as the Boy
achieves such a rare degree of communica-
tion with the audience that his death,
although e x p e c t e d , comes as a
disappointing blow.
T h i s production richly deserves its
wide a c c l a i m . It provides fresh insight
into the writing of Shakespeare, and
must go some way in restoring loss of
confidence in the nationalised theatre.

Music
Brain-damage
Hydra - Land of Honey (Capricorn)
T H E P O W E R - C H O R D barrage of the
first few seconds quickly puts you in
the picture as to possible brain-damage
for an unprepared listener to this waxing.
T h e opening couple of- sentences are
needless to say, the only intelligible
ones before the decibel ton-up is registered
on the old eardrum-o-meter and from
then on, all you catch are the intermittent
screams of " L i t t l e m i s s rock 'n r o l l "
(innovative, huh?) but the music —
greaty, gutsy, rock of good quality —
is pretty interesting, even good for
such a tired and overworked ganre.
Hydra have certainly learned their l i c k s
w e l l .
Spencer Kirkpatrick, on lead guitar,
is the central figure in dis'combo and
worry though, ' c o s the songs are strong
enough, and are well enough played to
make it all worthwhile. If they can
.reproduce anything like this live they'll
rbe worth s h a k i n ' out yer s h e c k l e s for
at the local P a l a i s - d e - D a n c e . Hydra emerged
from the rough-and-tumble Southern states
bar-and-club circuit around .1972 and
supplies the energy while the rhythm
section of O r v i l l e Davis (bass) and
Steve P a c e (drums) maintain a competent
background driving force. The v o c a l s
ef Wayne Bruce are something e l s e
ihough, reminiscent of Edgar (or Johnny)
Winter, ie pretty terrible and more than
often sound painfully strained. Not to
have impressed enough people sufficiently
since then to acquire the services of
the Allman B r o s producer, Johnny Sand I in,
for this, their second album.
It's all about the label really. When
you see a new release under the Capricorn
moniker you know what the game is —
you'r in for some uncomprosing country
or boogie, whether it's good or bad.
No d e a l s .
So, if Hydra can keep their heads
together, they might inject a bit of
bite into a currently easy prey — the
jaded rock scene of the moment. Shame
you can never get rock'n' rollers to
write worthwhile l y r i c s , though. Part
and parcel of the job, I s ' p o s e .

Blackmail,
disinheritance,
boiling water
" P l u n d e r " by Ben Travers.
The National Theatre at the Old V i c .
I s a y , old fruit, why don't you just
toddle down to the Old V i c at Waterloo?
The National Theatre are doing a simply
splendid run of the old Ben Travers
farce, Plunder. You remember those
frightfully amusing A d l w y c h farces of the
twenties? Well, this is one of those,
and it's a rattling good e v e n i n g ' s
.entertainment.
It's written on tne traditional lines of
farce and not at all like those frightful
modern imitations with trouserless
bishops coming from an interminable
series of bedrooms. You remember the
old style sort of thing, don't you? A c t I:
meet the characters and a s s e s s the
situation. A c t II the s i l l y old a s s gets
into hot water, though in this c a s e its
dashed near to boiling, and A c t III: he gets
out of it by the skin of his teeth.
What makes this one so ripping is the
addition of a crime, and a rea.Jly live body,
well a dead one actually; and then
there's a bit of disinheritance and
blackmail thrown in on the s i d e , to add to
the fun.
Dinsdale Landen makes the perfect
s i l l y old a s s . On the stage I mean.
H e ' s D ' A r c y T u c k , suitor to the disinherited
Joan Hewlett. H i s interview with the
police at Scotland Y a r d is top hole
stuff. And who'd've thought that D ' A r c y
could be such a booby as to take a sniff
of the knock-out drops intended for the
victim of the robbery? I mean to s a y —
Well, I jolly well do say what I mean
t o . . . s a y . . . y e s , indeed.
Who'de'you think is behind all these
going-ons, what? It's that Frank F i n l a y
chappie; all C a s s a n o v a and Hitler.
Never seen such a crafty looking man in
my life, devious even. But w i l l Mrs
Hewlett see through him as he eyes
her valuable jewellery? N o she jolly
well won't, because s h e ' s a s o c i a l
climber of the first water. She's played
by Dandy N i c h o l s and I never knew a
woman could be so fat; as D'Arcy
remarked, you'd need a taxi to get
round her.
T h e play is full of toppingly funny
moments, but you, brought up on a
diet of television comedy, might find the
first act a bit hard going. A s the proverb
runs, a little patience Is a l w a y s warmly
rewarded, what?, even with a little
boiling water.
