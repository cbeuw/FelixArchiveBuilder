Imperial College 1st 8
N C B 3rd 1
T H E R E T U R N match in the
league against N C B 3rd's
proved much easier than the
F i r s t encounter between the
two teams when IC won 5—4
after being 4—3 down. T h i s
time Cfawford of N C B could
not conjure up the s k i l l he
used last time in wirinjng 2
out of h i s 3 games, and was
soundly beaten in all 3 games.
Kim-Wei Ho and the captain
both won all three of their
games, C o l i n M c D o n a l d was
unfortunate to loose to- their
number one player who played
very much above himself to
win N C B ' s only game.

A P R O P O S A L C A L L I N G for
a lightening 24-hour strike w a s
narrowly defeated at a N ' J P E
(National Union for P u b l i c
E m p l o y e e s ) , meeting h e l d
last Tuesday morning. Another
proposal condeming " t h e act
of • non-co-operation by the
management with our shop-
s t e w a r d s " was put forward
by Mr R Patterson and carried
by a majority.
T h e act of non-co-operation
referred to moves by the
College to retire staff who
ware past the age of retirement.
The C o l l e g e had a l s o d i s m i s s e d
one man who had (and i s still)
suffering from a blood complaint
and s a c k e d two counter hands
from Southside Refectory.
M ' F i s h e r , branch secretary,
together with M ' B e a c h and
would certainly throw the
d i v i s i o n wide open.
Trevor Walker
M" Burridge subsequently mst

and Mr Roland later the same
morning. According to a letter
being sent out to N U P E members

agreed to greater co-operation
with the shop stewards.
The sick man who was

d i s m i s s a l notice c a n c e l l e d and
a letter s-int to him informing
him that the C o l l e g e w i l l

him a suitable position when
he returns from sick leave.
Mr F i s h e r i s to approach the
C o l l e g e with proposal asking
for a staggered pre-retirement
period . of three months for
those next in line to be retired.
The system he proposes i s for
a week in ths first month, two

proposal has been favourable.
Dear P e o p l e ,
I am here to bore you with a few Indolent t r i v i a l i t i e s relevant
to your student contribution to charity.
F o r some years now, various persons have been concerned with
unimaginative, affected, impactless name given to Rag(!) ie
'Imperial C o l l e g e Charity C a r n i v a l ! With this in mind it has been
decided to institute a competition to find a new name and new
image, the first (and only) prize being a large bottle of spirits!
Suggested names should be c l e a n , catchy and relevant to Imperial
C o l l e g e .

selectpd by a simple majority vote &t the last Union meeting of
Term (4th March).
The next item is to do with choice of charities for next y e a r ' s
Rag. We have drawn up a short list of a number of registered
charities selected on the b a s i s of p o s s i b l e w a y s in which they
can help our c o l l e c t i o n s (stickers, badges etc) it is up to you
to decide which one of these should be supported next year. Just
tick the charity you think most needy on the form below and
return it to IC Union office.
The penultimate thing is the State of Rag this year ie How
much w e ' v e c o l l e c t e d . Thihgg are not as good as last year on
the whole, but the Rag Mag is making money more quickly than
last year.
F i n a l l y , c o l l e c t i o n s for this term, Each of the C C U ' s w i l l be
having 3 c o l l e c t i o n s along with Rag Mag s e l l i n g trips to colleges
inside London and one or two outside. Term w i l l proljably finish
off with the Chariot R a c e . D e t a i l s from the C C U ' s .
