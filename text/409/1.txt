Student strike
impracticable
At the U G M on Thursday,
there were two main bouts
of excitement, one when I C U
President, P e t e r Teague
announced the £350,000
windfall, and the other when
RSMU President, N i c k Bradshaw
put a motion to the meeting
to proclaim C i t y and G u i l d s
Union a sub-committee of
Mines U n i o n .
Strike
T h e news of the extension
to L i n s t e a d H a l l * c a m e near
the start o f the meeting, when
Correspondence received w a s
read out. After t h i s , . i n the
P r e s i d e n t ' s B u s i n e s s ; Mr
Teague received support from
the meeting to make overtimes
to the trade Unions concerning
die S t u d e n t Strike and
Demonstration o n 27th February.
Mr Teague stated that it w a s
impracticable to attempt to
close the C o l l e g e without
the f u l l support of the U n i o n s
on campus. Whatever the
outcome of these t a l k s , he
s t i l l urged as many students
as p o s s i b l e to go on the
demonstration and work under
the I C banner which was
recently returned to die U n i o n .
Several motions, i n c l u d i n g
those to be put into the next
N U S national conference
were debated and eventually
carried.
L i v e l y debate
A lively debate w a s ,
however, precipitated by the
motion that full-time members
o f the N U S executive should
be paid a net salary equivalent
to the Postgraduate grant
with usual D E S allowances
for dependents. A t present
London-based full time members
of the N U S executive receive
£3200 per year. T h e motion
was p a s s e d overwhelmingly,
the general feeling being that
N U S executive members should
have a similar standard of
l i v i n g to that of the ordinary
student or postgraduate.
Another motion again p a s s e d
overwhelmingly, was that o n
central representation of
C o l l e g i a t e universities. Fearing
that the system would be
extended to L o n d o n , the
meeting rejected the N U S
executives d e c i s i o n that the
C o l l e g i a t e U n i v e r s i t i e s o f
Oxford and Cambridge should
be centrally represented.
D i s b a n d C & G
T w o other motions were
p a s s e d , re-affirming I C U ' s
p o l i c y on the National Secret
B a l l o t for executive members
and o n Overseas Students.
Mr Brayshaw then introduced
his motion to disband C i t y '
and G u i l d s U n i o n , the motion
was stopped after Mr Steve
H o y l e , P r e s i d e n t C & G U , had
s u c c e s s f u l l y challenged the
quorum. T h e highest total
for attendance this a c a l e m i c
year was recorded at 230.
STOP PRESS
Tne Walfsoc lecture adver-
tised for Monday has been
cancelled.
Endsleigh turn over
new leaf
IN R E S P O N S E to c r i t i c i s m
over the last 12 months,
E n d s l e i g h , the Insurance
company of N U S , are launching
a new motor insurance plan
c a l l e d Student plan 6.
Student plan 6, together with
Gradplan 6, form a n e w ,
o r i g i n a l type of motor
insurance p o l i c y , which an!
E n d s l e i g h spokesman described
as " r e v o l u t i o n a r y . " E s s e n t i a l l y ,
the p o l i c y covers • s i x months
instead of 12.
In many c a s e s , the c o s t of
two consecutive s i x month
p o l i c i e s , w i l l actually be l e s s
than a similar twelve month
p o l i c y . A s stated to the N U S
conference at Scarborough,
E n d s l e i g h made a l o s s of
approximately £10,000 last
year. F o l l o w i n g this, a d r a s t i c
re-appraisal o f " company
was made, and the new p o l i c y
d e v i s e d . R e a l i s i n g that
administration was a large
element of cost i n the labour-
intensive insurance industry,
they streamlined their system:
reducing' the number of regions
in the U K to two; G l a s g o w
L o n d o n , a n d the rest of the
country. T h e y have a l s o
reduced the number of categories
of motor v e h i c l e s . E n d s l e i g h
have published a leaflet of
their charges, enabling students
to calculate their own premiums
— this i s unheard of for an
insurance company. T h e
leaflet i s available from
any E n d s l e i g h office.
The new system w i l l have
no no-claims bonus, but a
"guaranteed b o n u s " , w h i c h
cannot be lost if the p o l i c y -
holder h a s an accident. T h e
bonus depends o n the experience
of the driver. If he h a s an
accident, the premium w i l l
be increased under a system
of surcharges, depending'
upon where the driver h a s
the accident (higher surcharges
for London and G l a s g o w ) , not
not where the v e h i c l e i s kept.
The s i x month " p o l i c y is
run by E n d s l e i g h i n conjunction
with Federation Mutual Insurance
L i m i t e d , a reputable, forward-
looking company.
E n d s l e i g h , as insurance
brokers, i s s u e approximately
160 thousand p o l i c i e s per
year. O f these, about 40
thousand are motor c a r p o l i c i e s , .
However, the c a r p o l i c i e s
make up 4 5 % o f the total
income of E n d s l e i g h . T h e
increase i n petrol charges
and road fund tax h a s resulted
in 2 5 % to 30% o f student
motorists s e l l i n g their c a r s or
suspending their p o l i c i e s o v e r
the past year. E n t h u s i a s t i c
employees are hoping that
this new scheme, which they
believe to be extremely
competitive, w i l l encourage
students back onto the road
i f only for s i x months i n the
summer.
Endsleigh intend to continue
with their 12 months Sun-
A l l i a n c e scheme, thus giving
a c h o i c e to c a r owners. A s
with a l l E n d s l e i g h p o l i c i e s ,
the holder h a s to be a full-time,
part-time or post graduate
student.
