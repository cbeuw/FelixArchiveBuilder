Compared with older people, you can buy
financial independence now far more cheaply,
more easily, and with almost no risk of being
turned down (as older people often are).
By making a very modest investment now,
you will command—when you need it—the
funds for buying a home, for investing in a
business or profession, or collateral for any
other purpose.
Our first priority is to advise you so well now,
while your budget is limited, that you will
continue to seek (and of course, evaluate) our
advice in the years to come, when you will be
much better off.
That is why we work hard to give you, as a
student, a financial plan that is tailored to your
needs and is demonstrably favourable to you
—a plan that will put you on the best road to
financial independence.
The Students' Financial Planning Division can
advise you objectively because it is entirely
independent of any Investment Institution or
Insurance Company. Advice is, of course, free
and involves you in no obligation.
You will receive full information about
programmes strictly relevant to your circum-
stances if you fill in and return this post-paid
enquiry form.
