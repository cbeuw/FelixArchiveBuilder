8 - F E L I X , O C T O B E R 4th 1976
F a r too much emphasis has
been p l a c e d on nuclear develop-
ment and far too little on
alternative technologies, says
the R o y a l Commission on
Environmental P o l l u t i o n ,
whose sixth report.'Nuclear
Power and the Environment',
was published in mid-sepember.
The report was prepared under
the chairmanship of S i r B r i a n
F l o w e r s .
A s expected the C o m m i s s i o n
has warned the Government
against nuclear expansion
until the problems of d i s p o s a l
and containment of both s o l i d -
and liquid-type wastes has
been adequately s o l v e d . The
use of fuels, such as Plutonium
is foolish, says the report,
when no certain method of
eliminating environmental
poisoning e x i s t s .
Nuclear expansion, states
the report would imply the
N u c l e a r caution
u r g e d by Rector
use of fast-breeder reactors on
a large scale, and a 'plutonium
economy' in which this element
would provide a principal fuel
for energy supply. T h e develop-
ment would a l s o have potential
implications of another kind.
World growth in nuclear power
would be likely to facilitate
the proliferation of nuclear
weapons. There would be the
risk of terrorist action against
nuclear installations using
f i s s i l e materials, e s p e c i a l l y
plutonium, as threats against
society. Sir B r i a n has made
clear before h i s opinion that
the question is n o t , whether
terrorists might s e i z e a nuclear
installation or consignment of
plutonium, but when. The
tightening of present security
measures is strongly urged.
So the F l o w e r s report does
not see the need to expand
nuclear power to the level of
a major energy producer in the
near future. Instead, it recom-
mends reseach into and the
employment of alternative
means of energy production.
T h i s , says the C o m m i s s i o n ,
should be regulated by a new
Government body set up
s p e c i f i c a l l y with this objective.
If music be the food of love, why
can't rabbits sing? My article in the
last F E L I X was entitled Practical
Rabbit, however, on taking psychiatric
and legal advice (the Playboy Corporation
didn't like me using their rabbits!) I find
that my articles must henceforth be
c a l l e d White Lies, which couldn't be
further from the truth...honest!
Practicalities
Onward ho to the p r a c t i c a l i t i e s . I see
my job as one in which I am here to
a s s i s t you in whatever way I can;
primarily by ensuring that the Union,
and a l l its integral parts, run smoothly
and efficiently and ultimately by ensuring
that your best interests are a l w a y s the
prime consideration in any action taken
on your behalf. I look upon "White L i e s "
as an opportunity to give you practical
information whilst a l s o filling you in on
what we're "getting up to in the Union
O f f i c e " . If you think we should be
concentrating on one area as opposed to
another then please tell u s . ' c o s Jimminy
Cricket may be an alternative to Capital
Radio but even he runs out of new ideas
sooner or later!!! Anyway...
Crash Pad
With this year's unprecedented
shortage of accommodation the Union
has felt it necessary to run a Crash Pad
Scheme. T h i s scheme w i l l ensure that
nobody is denied a place to s l e e p or
wash whilst they are seeking d i g s . If you
are one of these unlucky homeless
people then come to the IC Union Office
at 23.00 and we w i l l provide you with a
campbed and washing f a c i l i t i e s . There
will be a nominal charge of 10p per night
and there w i l l be a male and a female
dormitory. Anyone wishing to a s s i s t this
scheme please come and see me in the
Office (during daylight hours preferably!).
Furthermore, IF YOU ARE PREPARED
TO HAVE SOMEONE SLEEP ON YOUR
FLOOR OVERNIGHT PLEASE CONTACT
ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MY
INTERNAL TELEPHONE NUMBER IS
2488.
Panting
Parking Permit A p p l i c a t i o n forms are

the IC Union Parking Committee and a

are considered in the light of a set
selection policy, the guidelines outlined
therein are firm and they will be adhered
to strictly. A s always I must remind you
that, once the scheme has commenced,
THE PARKING OF VEHICLES NOT

Elections
What a wonderful year tor exam
results!?!
I am currently acting - Hon Junior
Treasurer,' Welfare Officer, VP ICU
(Mines Presidents post), Student Residence
Officer, Overseas Students Committee
Chairman, Carnival Co-ordinator, Mech
Eng Dep Rep and a few other positions
too! If you would wish to become one of
these Officers for real then put your
name up on a nomination paper in the
Union Lower Lounge (Council Notice
Board) and persuade some friends to
second y o u ; 'nough said?
At a recent press confer-
ence, Sir Brian s a i d that society
should be placed before the
energy race; he claimed that
the government tends to play
down the hazards of nuclear
technology. A public airing of
the matter, he said, is urgently
needed.
A completely d i f f e r e n t
viewpoint is taken by the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority, which accused the
Commission of overplaying the
environmental hazards. B r i t a i n ,
it says, is steadily being left
behind in the field of nuclear
power. It asks that more atomic
power stations be built immed-
iately, and stresses the need
for nuclear power. It derides
alternative sources a s , at best,
being capable of providing a
minor portion of the nation's
future energy needs.
Gestetner demos
The Union has recently bought some
new duplicators. The general use
duplicators are situated in the Outer
F e l i x Office, Union Archway. In order to
be able to use these duplicators you must
attend a demonstration of their usage to
be held at 13.00 ON FRIDAY 8TH
OCTOBER. Those present w i l l be
registered as permitted to use the
machines and w i l l be entitled to sign
out the keys to the machines. Paper and
ink is available from the Union Office
if reuuired.
Publicity rules OK
P l e a s e note that there is a " C o d e
of P r a c t i c e " which you are asked to
adhere to when publicising anything on
IC Union Notice Boards. A copy of these
rules is available, on request, from
myself. Failure to comply with these
rules may render the poster producers/
distributors liable to action by the ICU
D i s c i p l i n e Committee.
IC Union General Meeting
There w i l l be the first U G M of term
on Thursday (7th October) at 13.00 in
the Great H a l l , Sherfield B u i l d i n g .
The main item of business w i l l be
changes to the Imperial C o l l e g e Union
By L a w s . My own feelings on this
subject are that I would like to change
the By L a w s into a form whereby the
Union is brought up to date and has a
cleaner slate from which to progress.
The By L a w s are included as an
insert in this F E L I X . Look at them!
Think about them!
Do you not think that there should
be a facility whereby you can d i s m i s s a
Union Officer sabbatical or otherwise if
he is seen to be not performing his job?
At the moment you can't. Do you not
think that the Sabbatical Officers should
have a job description laid down t i n
which would be their responsibilities,
their p a y " , their holiday leave and so on?
At the moment there isn't. Do you not
think that a U G M should be able to
mandate its officers to carry out the
wishes of the Union Members? At the
moment you can't.
These are just some of the i s s u e s
involved. If you want to see your Union
straightened out and take part in this
process of self-determination then please
come along
Matters also to be d i s c u s s e d w i l l
include our motions to be submitted to
the NUS Conference.
That's a l l I've got for now.
