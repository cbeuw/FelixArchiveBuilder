Water-polo team returns successful
by Colin Dale
T H E I C water-polo C l u b
completed a very s u c c e s s f u l
season with the annual five-
match tour of Dorset in which
they were unbeaten.
The team arrived on a
c o l d , breezy Saturday afternoon
at an outdoor swimming pool
in Lymington. T h e salt water
pool was situated just above
the harbour and the sight of the
one foot waves on the surface,
combined with the rain before
the match, sent Amir scurrying
for the brandy.
IC immediately s e t the
pattern for the rest of the
tour, running out winners by
6 goals to 1.
In the first two quarters
Andy Smith and Rory L e w i s
combined w e l l upfront, Andy
scoring the first two goals
and Rory following up with the
third. C l i f f Spooner and P a u l
Hindle controlled the game
from midfield, while Amir

the few Lymington attacks.
Before half-time w a s up
Andy had completed h i s
hat-trick.
With the general consent
of a l l concerned, the rest
periods were cut short and the
second half got underway with
Mark (showing h i s usual
enthusiasm for c o l d water) and
Amir replaced b y Dave

Rory h a d soon completed
his hat-trick with two more
goals, Lymington i n the
meantime scoring while being
a man up.

After c l o s i n g time a combined
effort w a s made to stagger
back to the caravan site in
the dark, where the team
played cards into the early
hours of the morning. T h i s
procedure seemed to become
standard practice a s the week
went b y .
On Tuesday morning the
team travelled to Bournemouth
ready for the evening match.
The change i n weather enabled
everyone to add sunburn to the
bruises of the previous d a y ' s
football match on the beach.
The team, strengthened by
the arrival of J i m Williams and
M i c h a e l McCartney, were
relieved to be back to warm
water in an indoor p o o l .
Memories of the previous
year's punch-up were soon
forgotten a s I C took control
of the match to beat Bournemouth
by 12 goals to 4.
M i c h a e l immediately made
h i s presence felt by scoring
a hat-trick. Rory and C l i f f
obtained their usual quota of

keeper for the whole tour)
made up for an early mistake
with two brilliant point-blank
saves i n the second part of the
game. After the match I C

round of drinks by the Bourne-
mouth team i n the bar of a
local fire station.
The new members of the
club looked forward to the
match against Bridport with

T h i s was the only goal i n the
quarter, everyone obviously
overawed by the momentus

Bridport scored three goals
while Rory completed h i s
hat-trick. C l i f f finally rounded
off the score — another victory
for IC b y 10 goals to 5.
In the meantime Rory had
arranged another match at

Andover replied with two
