Sir B r i a n
captain of
F l o w e r s , Rector: Dynamic
the C o l l e g e team, described
in the Sunday Times as a " p o l i t i c a l
• h e a v y w e i g h t " . Maintains h i s position by
his amazing ability to o s c i l l a t e from
left to right wing at such a speed that
he appears to be on neither. Energetically
suited to the role, he has an atomic shot
and i s a member of both the B r i t i s h and
' European Squads.
Wears a roll-neck jersey.
Ambition: to win the European Cup.
It
Mickey D a v i e s , Secretary: Unflappable
inside right with the unusual ability
' of being able to mesmerise the opposition
with a single glance w h i c h , it i s reputed,
. can a l s o freeze water. H a s a dynamite
shot and has scored many goals in past
matches.
Wears a Welsh international rugby shirt.

to smile whilst cutting budgets and win
friends."

A F T E R L A S T year's moribund g o a l - l e s s
draw, the pundits are already convinced
that this year's annual spectacular
series of games between the C o l l e g e and
Union All-Stars w i l l produce the goals
and the magic which have characterised
so many of the past meetings between
these two charismatic teams. T h e
C o l l e g e ' s undoubted supremacy on the
right wing seems to have been reinforced
by the tactical signing last year of a
retired naval captain, whilst the injury-
prone Union team has no fewer than
five new faces on its bench, one of whom
i s a mystery player whose identity i s for
the moment unknown.
Before any more ado, let u s take a
look at the two teams.
Capt L i n d l e y R N (retd), Domestic
Secretary. A stern o l d mariner with a
definite d i s l i k e for Cuban stamps and
" r e d r e v o l u t i o n a r i e s " . P l a y s hard on the
right wing and i s difficult to block and
tackle. L i k e s a strategy to be watertight,
but sometimes ends up in a mess. C o u l d
be explosive if the word " r i d i c u l o u s " i s
mentioned.
Wears navy blue.
Ambition: to become the anchor man of
his team and to avoid being hijacked
to Cuba.
Victor Mooney, Refectory Manager:
Perfected h i s body swerve by dodging
around the Southside kitchens c h a s i n g
cockroaches. T r i e s to cater for the
opposition without much s u c c e s s .
Probably destined for the thankless
position of goalkeeper which w i l l keep
him right in the firing line. A poor
chipper of the b a l l .
Wears a pork pie hat.
Ambition: to get his yacht repaired.
Carl Seaford, Domestic Manager: Demoted
last year from mid-field dynamo to right-
back, but manages to pretend that this
makes no difference. A veteran of many
hard-fought matches in previous y e a r s .
Has yet to score a convincing goal.
Wears a Cambridge blue hockey jersey.
Ambition: to be on good terms with
both teams and one day to return to
Rhodesia.
The Union
All-Stars
Nick Brayshaw, President: T h i s year's
Union All-Stars captain and last year's
biggest drunk i n the league. Budding T V
star, renowned streaker and public
relations officer to the L i b y a n E m b a s s y .
H i s notorious record h a s in no way
affected h i s genuine and absolute
integrity as a footballing maestro.
P l a n s to throw everything (including
empty milk bottles) into attack.
Wears nothing at all.
Ambition: to grow a beard.
Derrick Everett, Deputy President:
Amateur player who wants to turn
professional next year i n order to lead
7 7 / 7 8 ' s team. H a s to prove himself a
match winner and could probably do s o .
Off the field a prolific writer of memos
and letters. Hopes to bring the C o l l e g e
team to its knees with an inexorable
torrent of post-match correspondence.
Sometimes mistaken for a linesman
because he plays s o close to the right
wing touchline.
Wears a moustache and shocking green
socks.
Ambition: to score.
