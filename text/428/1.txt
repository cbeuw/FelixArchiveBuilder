Human errors on Handbook-IC Union foots £200 bill
Dear Fresher letter
Sabbatical Handbook Editor at Harrods-storm brewing
Mix-ups between the College Registry, IC Union Handbook
Editor Paul Ekpenyong, IC Union Executive, and the F E L I X
Office have cost IC Union £185'. T h i s sum fs for overtime
work by F E L I X litho-printer Ian Morse, who in one week
put in 57 extra hours, necessary to enable the Handbook
to be finished by its deadline of 13th August'.
This date was given to Mr Ekpenyong and F E L I X by
Registry v i a IC Union Honarary Secretary John (Chalky)
White; it transpired after completion that Registry did not
in fact require the Handbook until 20th August'. However
the Union E x e c u t i v e decided to trim a week off the
available time, so that they could study the Handbook in
depth, and then write a Freshers' letter to be included in
the Registry mailing'. With this extra week at the F E L I X
unit's disposal, it is unlikely that overtime payments
would have been necessary; as it i s , the Handbook has
over-run its budget of £200 by twice that figure'.
Furthermore it seems likely
that furore w i l l develop over
the actual content of the
Handbook; two C C U s , the
Royal School of Mines Union
and City & G u i l d s Union,
did not submit entries, neither
did many Union c l u b s . Deputy
President Derrick Everett
summed up the feelings of the
Union O f f i c i a l s , 'It's not so
much what was in it, but what
was left out that mailers'.
Many officers, including
Peter Teague (last year's
President) and Chalky White,
are unhappy that the editor
was working in Harrods during
the last four weeks of h i s
F e l i x sabbatical. This they
cite as the main reason for the
rushed editing that has
resulted in what they term a
'shoddy' handbook. Whilst
acknowledging the effect of
his absence, Mr Ekpenyong
was keen to point out 'That one
of the main sections of the
Handbook, Welfare, did not
come in to be typeset until
four days before printing
actually finished.
Nearly blank pages
At one point, the Union
Executive was debating
whether or not to send out the
Handbook in the Registry
mailing to freshers. T h i s year
was the first i n recent times
that the Handbook had been
sent to freshers prior to term;
this c o i n c i d e d with a new
format to the publication.
Despite this, President N i c k
Brayshaw finds inexcuseable
'the nearly blank pages, the
spelling mistakes in headlines
and the lack of cohesion in
major sub-committee articles.'
Censure motion
The first public signs of
anger are liable to come at
Thursday's U n i o n General
Meeting, where a censure
motion against Mr Ekpenyong
is expected. T h e financing of
the Handbook w i l l a l s o be
d i s c u s s e d at a meeting of the
U n i o n ' s P u b l i c a t i o n s Board
next T u e s d a y . A t both meetings
Mr Ekpenyong w i l l claim that
'the Handbook budget was
paltry. In comparison, we're

Photo-Booth
A n instant photo-booth w i l l
be positioned at the entrance
to the Union Lower Refectory
from the beginning of term.
•The booth, which produces 4
passport s i z e d photographs
for use on U n i o n , N U S and
Student R a i l c a r d s , w i l l be
there for an experimental
period of 6 months to evaluate
demand.

B R U N E L U n i v e r s i t y ' s mascot
Izzy i s now at I . C . following
a weekend raid in August on
Brunei Students U n i o n .
The mascot, a s i x foot high
green and yellow fibreglass
dinosaur, normally resides i n
B r u n e l s beer garden at the
centre of the Students Union;
unlike Mike, the I.C. mascot,
Izzy was on d i s p l a y twenty-four
hours a day. It had been c o n s i d -
ered impossible to grab since
the dinosaur i s usually filled
with sand.
However the sand had recen-
tly been removed to enable
repairs to be carried out. T h e
I.C. students on the raid were
aware ofthis and s o j u s t walked
in and snatched the mascot,
without any resistence. T h e
only other people in the Union
were a band, who 'Only practise
here on Saturdays'. Brunei later
claimed that one o f their V i c e -
Presidents s a w the whole
operation.
Izzy was later taken to the
Union Bar for the evening, bed-
ecked in Constituent C o l l e g e
Union ties. I C Union had dec-
lined to take responsibility for

A character known a s ' M i k e '

the raid and offered to return
the mascot if £50 i s donated to
the I.C. R a g charities, and 150
pints of b l o o d i s given by Brunei
students at the beginning of

gave 97 pints. F o r every pint
less than 150 an extra 50p w i l l

deadline for the handover of
Izzy has been set a s November
