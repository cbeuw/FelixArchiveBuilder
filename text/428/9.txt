Union Bar
- A PERSONAL VIEW FROM A P.A.
T o put it p l a i n l y , in words of
not more than two s y l l a b l e s ,
the Union B a r lives in the
bottom right hand corner of
the Union B u i l d i n g , but, as you
may expect, there i s more to it
than just that. In a c o l l e g e
which boasts more bars than
any other in the country, (and
that includes the universities)
there has to be a good reason
for one in particular to be
singled out as ' T H E B A R ' .
On swinging through the
double doors, of windowed
plywood and oak (respectively)
the R o m a n t i c ' s immediate view
i s stunning. T w o large oak
tables, a couple of smaller ones
and many bare wooden s t o o l s ,
in front of a bar spanning the
width of the room. But it i s
behind the bar that this Roman-
t i c ' s e y e w i l l travel first, for
it i s there, behind this much
used counter, with its ample
dispensary of ales and lagers,
that you w i l l s e e the finest
arrangement of pewter-ware,
not just in a c o l l e g e bar, nor
London, but 'to be sure, to be
sure' in the world.
For in this Union B a r , the
array of pewter pots represents
every club captain, chairman,
president and member. A n d it
is not only for the 'old members'
of C o l l e g e that these exalted
positions are held. There
always seems to be room on
the shelves for 'your' pot.
On a few rare days each
year, y o u may be w i t n e s s to
strange s i g h t s ; people being
skidded across the aforemen-
tioned oak tables (take heart,
you should be so lucky, or s o
proud) as part of ' i n i t i a t i o n '
ceremonies.
T h i s preamble sounds like
an invitation — or maybe a
travel brochure — and that i s
what it was meant to be.
The frequenters of the bar
do not, however, take note of
the decor, nor interest in the
paraphernalia. They are here
simply to enjoy, in the presence
of friends, a drink. There i s no
thought of trying to live up to,
or down to any standards —
beyond 'Don't take yoiurglass
outside, if you please.' T h e y
are just revelling in a well
earned, w e l l served drop of
their favourite tipple. In the
Union B a r y o u c a n dance, y o u
can sing, you can do anything—
or your own thing— and no-one
w o r r i e s .
And I should know. I've
been here a long, long time.
I sign myself,
