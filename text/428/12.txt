OPSOG SELL OUT
A report by Roger Woodward on O p s o c ' s Summer Tour (July 24th - August 6th).
On Saturday J u l y 24th, 80 members
of Opsoc set out for their, now familiar,
tour venue — Budleigh Salterton i n E a s t
Devon. O n arrival the local papers h a d
gone to town with some very welcome,
and more importantly, F R E E publicity.
The local press hoardings read " P i r a t e s
at B u d l e i g h " and we knew we were in
for a fantastic reception.
T h e opening night, normally only
half-full,was completely sold out and the
opening night reception when a l l the
audience w a s invited to 'meet the
company' w a s a n uncalculated s u c c e s s .
T h e response w a s maintained throughout
the fortnight and for the first time, we
managed to s e l l 2250 tickets — the
maximum.
A s usual the middle weekend was
occupied by rehearsal a n d performance
of our Charity Concert. T h e Chorus
performed the E a s t e r Hymn from C a v a l l e r i a
R u s t i c a n a by M a s c a g n i , with the solo
sung by Sally H e s l o p . There followed a
series of excerpts from ' T h e Water
M u s i c ' and a group of madrigals sung
by members of the Society. T h e second
part of the Concert opened with H a y d n ' s
' L o n d o n ' symphony and c l o s e d with
Vaughn Williams' choral masterpiece
'Serenade to M u s i c ' , S o l o i s t s Delith
Brook, Deborah Kemp, T i m Johnson and
John Barratt; solo v i o l i n D a v i d G r e e d .
The shows themselves were a roaring
s u c c e s s under the baton of Michael
Withers, an e x - I C chemist and the
s k i l l f u l production of P e t e r M i l l s ,
well-known to Opsoc enthusiasts a s a
performer rather than a man behind the
s c e n e s .
There follows a transcript of a
revue published in the Exmouth &
E a s t Devon Journal on Saturday August
7th:-
The Zoo was the one-act curtain
raiser. It is a slight piece intended as a
satire on Grand Opera. However the
libretto of BC Stevenson lacks the
trenchant humour of Sullivan's more
usual collaborator, and although it was
pleasant entertainment, its presentation
was mianly of historical interest.
I think it was a very wise move to
set the scene in 1905, (the opera was
first produced in 1875) as that era of
decaying empire seems wholly appropriate
to the melodramatic proceedings. 1
thought I could detect a hint of the
music-hall in some of the staging, but it
may have been coincidence.
Although chorus and soloists all were
in good voice, Delith Brook as the lovely
Laetitia deserves especial mention. Her
quasi-Mozartian coloratura flourishes
were delightful.
The main work of the evening was of
course "The Pirates of Penzance and
and it was a first-rate production. My
hero of the evening was Roger Woodward,
who sang the Major-General's song at
such an impressive rate of knots that the
orchestra were hard pressed to keep up
with him. Teresa Quinn was a charming
Mabel and Max Taylor a convincing
Frederic.
All in all it was difficult to find faults
of much consequence, and the enthusiastic
capacity audience generated a feeling
of well-being which 1 am sure must have
been felt on the other side of the foot-
lights. The producers, Roger Woodward
and Peter Mills and musical Director
Michael Withers are to be congratulated
on the high standard they have achieved,
and I feel sure that the Society's next
visit to Budleigh Salterton will he
keenly anticipated.
Perhaps local producers of plays and
operas could take a lesson from the
Imperial College production on achieving
maximum effect from the minimum of
scenery and props.

Love and affection all the way
I'VE S E E N Joan live three times in the
last six months; each time s h e ' s impressed
me a s an up-and-coming artist who
deserves to make the big time. Perhaps
I should say J o a n ' s live work is mesmeric,
her contrasting repertoire of folk and
camp-fire odes leaving audiences with a
strange s e n s e of fulfilment - something
you don't expect from a support artist.
Given that Joan Armatrading is
primarily a stage artist, I suppose I'm
at a disadvantage when reviewing her
latest L P s i n c e I've heard most of the
material live. However G l y n Johns (a
famous producer no less) and Joan have
succeeded in recreating her stage
atmosphere on at least half of the L P ,
namely the first s i d e .
Another s u c c e s s of the production is
that J o a n ' s vocal and guitar work are
both well highlighted. T h e latter i s
Joan A r m a t r a d i n g ' - A & M Records
extremely good and together with J o a n ' s
creative ability in v o c a l , lyrical and
musical departments g i v e s her a rare
set of talents.
The album presents songs of varying
tempos and moods from the provactively
assertive 'Down To Zero' which opens
the L P , to more gently romantic ballads
like 'Help Yourself and 'Love and
Affection'. T h e latter i s my favourite;
it must be the most natural song on the
L P , with the stage atmosphere precisely
reproduced. T h e song gradually unveils
itselfjslowly engulfing y o u . J o a n ' s deep
croaking voice i s ever present (Pingpong
thought the singer was N i i s s o n 1
) :
saxaphone adds the s c i n t i l l a t i n g touch of
magic.
The only track on the first side that
perhaps doesn't just manage to manifest
Revamped oldie fails to please
IN T H E 'est two years there's been
quite a glut of records s o l e l y containing
re-released material, e s p e c i a l l y when an
artist h a s changed label and become
s u c c e s s f u l . My normal policy is to give
a track listing and throw in a few
pertinent comments. After a l l if people
wanted the material they would have
bought it on first release.
Having been slightly favourably
disposed to A n d y ' s recent efforts I w a s
prepared to give this L P a second glance,
despite the lack of s l e e v e notes on
musicians and irrespective of my patchy
musical memory for the '70—71 era
from which these cuts are taken.
'Andy Fairweather L o w ' — R C A
Out of the L P ' s nine, songs only
four are worth talking about. T h e best
'/ Hear You Knocking' f Y e s that one) i s
the album's last track; by that time I'd
got suitably naused-off after many a
second-rate track. T h i s track though i s
superb just for Fairweather's virtuoso
guitar playing — literally from the word
go. V o c a l s aren't bad either. Overall
the c u t i s marginally better than Dave
Edmunds' for excitement.
Other goodies are 'Natural Sinner';
'nuff said and ' L a y It On Me , which
essentially i s Natural Sinner Mark 2.
'Beginning From An End', a fine b r a s s /
its stage e x c e l l e n c e i s 'Water With The
Wine'. Nevermind one can't expect
miracles.
In comparison to the first s i d e the
second is a little shallow in feeling,
although J o a n ' s somewhat innate sense
of rythm, prevalent throughout the L P ,
comes to the fore in this section. T h e
best track here i s 'Like Five' ably
illustratinq her vocal and quitar dexterity.
Sch s Roses?
Whilst aided and abetted by a fine set
of musicians J o a n ' s talent shows through
remarkably w e l l on this L P , and the
L P ' s certainly worth purchasing. One
small point i s that the album gradually
w a l k s up behind y o u and grabs you
totally and without warning after about
six plays. So beware IT GROWS O N Y O U .

guitar instrumental number completes the
enjoyable tracks.
The rest of the L P is rather second-
rate, drab and tedious and my ears
were pleased to s e e the back of it. Not
an album I'd recommend, even though it
does have its moments. Generally if the
L P was going to s e l l well it would have
done so in 1971.
