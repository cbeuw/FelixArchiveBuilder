ULU presses for
catering price cuts
The University of London
has advised i t s constituent
s t u d e n t unions to apply
immediately for reductions in
residence fees and refectory
prices for the coming term."
T h i s follows a University
Grants C o m m i t t e e ( U G C )
memorandum to universities that
from 1st August 1976 more
expenditure may be charged to
university general accounts, a s
opposed to the consumer.
The U G C , a Government
advisory body on university
finance, had formerly expected
catering and residence accounts
to be self balancing. U p until
the end of J u l y , universities
were able to c h a r g e only
certain items to their general
accounts; these included rent,
rates, insurance, c l e a n i n g ,
heating, repairs a n d redecora-
tions.
They w i l l now be able, in
addition, to charge central

I C undergraduate student
P a u l Mower w a s amongst the
32 survivors from the wooden
minesweeper Fittleton, which
sunk whilst participating i n a
N A T O exercise two weeks
ago. The Fittleton c o l l i d e d
with the frigate Mermaid during
the massive exercise i n the
North Sea; ten of the Fittleton's
crew of 42 lost their lives as
the 22 year o l d minesweeper
plumeted to the bottom of the
sea.
• The Fittleton was manned
almost entirely from the
London d i v i s i o n of the R o y a l
N a v a l R e s e r v e . Some of the
crew, including P a u l Mower
had joined the R N R barely
four weeks before.
Commenting on h i s ordeal
P a u l , wrfo today starts h i s
second year in the Mathematics
department, said: 7 thought I
was going to die. The ship
turned turtle and I was trapped
underneath. I was wearing a
life jacket because I couldn't
swim. I held my breath and
grabbed anything that came
to hand. It seemed like an
eternity but finally I bobbed
to the surface. The rescue
boat arrived within minutes
and I was pulled out of the
water".
Break in
There w a s a break-in at
the Union Refectory during the
holiday. N o damage w a s done
and nothing w a s stolen. How-
ever the intruder(s) d i d leave

administrative work(such a s
accounting) and the salary of
one catering officer to general
accounts. F u r t h e r m o r e , in
catering units, the cost of heat,
light, power and water, together
with m i s c e l l a n e o u s c o s t s
- cleaning materials, stationery
and laundry- can now be charged
to general accounts. A t I C this
amounts to £20-25,000 on the
catering side alone.
No excuse
S t u d e n t leaders a n d
university authorities have
pressed for this type of relaxa-
tion i n financing for some time.
F o r the last few y e a r s , the
U G C has turned a blind eye to
the blatant flouting of i t s
regulations by universities,
including I C . T h e attitude of
the memorandum i s that now
there i s no excuse for deficits
on these accounts.
The new measures have
been cautiously welcomed by
I C o f f i c i a l s . N i c k B r a y s h a w
commented: 'The way these two
accounts have been handled
at IC to date means that the
new measures will make little
or no difference.' I C Union i s
not expected to follow the U L U
line on price d e c r e a s e s . Neither
does it support the U L U cam-
paign for greater s u b s i d i e s on
these accounts. Mr Brayshaw
views subsidies as a temporary
measure necessary because
students 'simply cannot afford
the charges required to make
these items economically
viable.'
The Rector points out that
no extra recurrent grant for
general accounts w i l l be forth-
Exam
failures
Crippling exam results,
which last year decimated the
ranks of G u i l d Union officers
have this year been transferred
to Mines U n i o n . T h e latter
start the term without a
President, after the departure
of Martin L e v y .
The other main casualty
from Mines i s B o b Longman
who w a s to be I C U Carnival
Co-ordinator. T w o other I C U
positions, Welfare a n d Student
R e s i d e n c e , are now vacant
following the failure o f
Guildsmen Dave C h a n c e and
Dave Knights, respectively,
to get back to I C .
R C S U d i d not suffer any
serious c a s u a l t i e s , despite the
departure of former Broadsheet
Editor N i g e l Reditt ( P h y s i c s 2).
However Honorary Junior
Treasurer Caroline P r e s t o n ,
who p a s s e d her exams in
P h y s i c s , has now decided to
leave I C .
coming from the U G C . T h e
position for I C has not therefore
changed much, s i n c e i t h a s
struggled for some years to keep
its general accounts in credit.
In the next year, earnest
attempts w i l l be made by the
Refectory Committee, under the
new chairmanship of P r o f e s s o r
E i l o n , to e l i m i n a t e deficit
makers in the catering system.
L a s t year, the estimated l o s s
by refectories w a s £57,000.
A surplus of £17,000 on the
bar and c e l l a r accounts brought
this down to £40,000. T h e
Governing Body hopes that the
bar profits w i l l top £25,000
this year. D e s p i t e U n i o n
opposition, prices have been
raised by 2p a pint and 2p a tot
( on spirits) to achieve this.
The U G C measures mean
that refectory deficits w i l l have
to be trimmed by £7-12,000 for
the catering account to achieve
self-supporting status.
L A D I E S
LOOS
During the Summer vacation
alterations have been made to
the ladies toilet in the Union
B u i l d i n g to prevent a reoccur-
ence of last y e a r ' s rape there.
Time switches, operated only
by a k e y , now control lights
in the E a s t staircase of the
building and in the l a d i e s
toilet itself."
There are also alarm b e l l
pushes in the toilet. B e l l s for
these, which are distinct from
those for the fire alarms, are
placed i n the Union B a r , the
Dramsoc storeroom, the
Union office and Central
Security in the Sherfield
B u i l d i n g . Union o f f i c i a l s
stress that these alarms
should not be abused or the
new measures w i l l become
ineffective.
N U S 'organ1
rationed
I C U N I O N h a s ordered only
five copies of N U S ' s National
Student for the forthcoming
academic year. T h i s follows a
decision by N U S to charge
Student unions l p a copy for
the paper. Formerly I C U h a d
received 500 c o p i e s of each
issue.
In making their d e c i s i o n
both this year's and last year's
I C U E x e c u t i v e feel that the
Union already p a y s enough to
NUS (£5,000 this year) and
that more free s e r v i c e s should
be emanating from N U S for
this money. C o p i e s of future
editions of National Student
will be available for reading
in the Union Office.
Super-
cheap
discount
card
A s plans for a nationwide
student discount scheme
materialise, I C U n i o n i s
preparing to undercut the
NUS scheme by \2Vi%.
The scheme i s based on a
discount c a r d , to be s o l d b y
large student unions (such as
ICU) together with a handbook,
listing traders and s e r v i c e s
offering student discounts. T h e
idea i s that the unions would
buy large numbers of these
cards and s e l l them, with their
associated handbooks, to their
members at £2. T h e union
concerned w o u l d then send
details of card buyers to N U S ,
who would give the union a
25% commission (50p) for each
card s o l d .
IC Union w i l l be selling the
cards at £1.75, taking only
25p to cover postage, corres-
p o n d e n c e ' a n d o t h e r
administrative c o s t s . In
coming to this d e c i s i o n Union
leaders consulted their Senior
Treasurer, D r Ken Weale .
The move is likely to have
local repercussions since a l l
of N U S ' s 90 T r a v e l a n d
Insurance shops w i l l be s e l l i n g
the cards at £ 2 . T h i s includes
the N U S T r a v e l office in I C
Union and the E n d s l e i g h office
in Old Brompton R o a d .
Nevertheless it seems
unlikely that N U S w i l l take
action against I C U for under-
cuttingits serviceorganisations.
In a letter to last y e a r ' s I C U
President, Peter T e a g u e ,
discount scheme organiser
Pete A n w y l said that whilst
the possibility of retailing
the card at less than £2 had not
been considered, 'it is up to
each Constituent Organisation
(of N D S ) what they wish to do
with the ?5% (commission)'.
The student discount card
w i l l provide students with an
average 10% discount at some
11,000 retail outlets throughout
the country. These include
branches of WH Smith, V i r g i n
Records and Ryman L t d .
Services such as the R A C
and the British School of
Motoring are a l s o covered by
the scheme.
Smaller student unions, such
as the one at L'Institut
Franc a i s , who do not have
administrative resources, w i l l
operate a different system for
obtaining discount cards. T h e s e
unions w i l l distribute order
forms to their members,
sending completed forms back
to N U S , who w i l l issue the
cards direct. In this case a
commission of 5 - 1 0 % w i l l be
paid.
I C Union has initially
ordered 200 discount cards and
hand books, and these are now
available from the Union
O f f i c e .
