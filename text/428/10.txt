Bit of a giggle -
but give it a whirl
ICDS, known (o a l l as Dramsoc,
inhabits a room on the 2 ' i floor of the
Union B u i l d i n g , c a l l e d the Storeroom,
although at F r e s h e r ' s F a i r we w i l l be on
display in a l l our glory on the stage in
the Concert H a l l . Dramsoc i s dedicated to
j o l l i f i c a t i o n ; for both the people who
watch our productions and the people
who put them on, and we need Y O U
(but b e , w a r n e d , hard work is involved).
We need you if you are interested in
acting, lighting, directing, building,
sound, costumes (please!) or even just
painting sets.
In one year we do a large production
at Christmas and usually a slightly
smaller one at Easter. L a s t year our
productions were 'The C a p t a i n of
Kopernick' by Zuckmayer and 'Two
Gentlemen of V e r o n a ' at Christmas and
E a s t e r respectively.
T h i s year's Christmas production is
' B e c k e t t ' by J e a n A n o u i l h . In addition
we are hoping to do some short lunchtime
p l a y s and also work with S T O I C , which
could lead to glory on I L E A channel 7.
You could find joining Dramsoc a
bit of a giggle — give it a whirl anyway.
See you at F r e s h e r s F a i r .

Cheap and
on the level
B e i n g at university in London you
have all the opportunities to have a
resourceful and enjoyable time, and one
way of really taking advantage of
London is through the cinema.
IC F i l m Society s p e c i f i c a l l y caters
for the individual who wants to see good
films cheaply and on the l e v e l . Our
films are chosen so that they do not
c l a s h with those screened elsewhere in
the c a p i t a l . The current trend is to show
films, such as Night Porter and The
Passenger, w h i c h have been released a
few years ago, but which are no longer
being shown in L o n d o n .
There is also a selection of golden
o l d i e s , such as Casablanca and The
General, films w h i c h have become c l a s s i c s
for a l l time. A l s o the Society tries to
put on a variety of foreign films, some
well-known like C h a b r o l ' s Le Boucher
and R a y ' s Company Limited, which w i l l
interest an E n g l i s h - s p e a k i n g audience.
There are even some big films, such as
Summer of '42.
One way or another F i l m s o c tries to
put on a varied show, so how about
coming to the F i l m Society stall at
tomorrow's Freshers F a i r to find out
more about the films and the Society.

Musical society
with a difference
O P S O C is a musical society with a
difference. Our main raison d'etre is,
of course, to put on operas (usually
Gilbert and Sullivan) which we do twice
a year. One show takes place at IC in
February, then in J u l y the cast, orchestra
and stage-crew all descend on the
otherwise quiet s e a s i d e town of Budleigh
Salterton to put on a production there,
in 1976, the shows performed were
"UtopiaLimited" by Gilbert and S u l l i v a n ,
and "The Zoo" by Sullivan and Rowe.
Rehearsals are held on Tuesday evenings
throughout IC terms.
But that is only half the story. For
example, last years activities also
included concerts, carol singing, an
opera workshop, singing through all
thirteen G & S operas non-stop for charity,
and lots of parties. Come and see the
Opsoc stand at Fresher's Fair, or turn
up at a rehearsal in the A s s o c i a t e d
Studies building, 53 P r i n c e ' s Gate, any
Tuesday at 7.30pm. For more informatinn,
contact O p s o c ' s chairman; Tim Frain
(Physic's 3).

Get in focus
L e t me take this opportunity
to join in the chorus of
Welcomes you've been
receiving; particularly to
the Freshers, whom I w i s h a
pleasant stay at Imperial
C o l l e g e ; I hope y o u ' l l achieve
a l l you want to.
Now to the Photographic
Society. IC P h o t s o c exists to
promote and develop interest
in photography amongst members
of the C o l l e g e . It has two
well-equipped darkrooms for
the use of club members,
and organises various a c t i v i t i e s
for them.
A l s o in the pipeline is a
portrait s e s s i o n , where an
expert w i l l be on hand to
advise on lighting techniques,
t h e main, and annual
competition takes place in
March.
The Society has a young,
but a c t i v e , colour group
whose activities place colour
processing within easy reach
of every member, material
cost permitting. The P h o t s o c
Services group caters for
those interested in commercial
work. Contact me for further
Included in the activities already organised for this term are:-

shops on s p e c i a l t e c h n i q u e s , '
and competitions. We usually
meet at 7pm on Tuesdays in
the Geology lecture theatre
(RSM 2028).
The Society is currently
planning a series of monthly
competitions where prints c a n
be judged at 'open meetings'.
T h i s should enable members
to see how judges work.
d e t a i l s .
In spite of the economic
problems, drought, etc.
afflicting the country, we are
set for a boom year. We
only require the services of
two trouble-shooters, namely a
Secretary (to organise meetings)
and a P u b l i c i t y Officer. Think
you can do it? T h e n contact
me in Mechanical Engineering
Room 481.
If you just want to join
the Society then come along
to our stall at Freshers F a i r
or pop into our first meeting.
