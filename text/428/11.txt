L e g e n d has it that there are
hoards of S T O I C hounds who
l i e i n wait i n Wardour St for the
next unfortunate f i l m star to
p a s s . We are told that be is
q u i c k l y bundled into a waiting
Union v a n and driven, bound
hand and foot, to an obscure
back door to I C ' s E l e c t r i c a l
Engineering department. Here,
so the story goes, the wretched
star is l e d to a heavily sound-
proofed room 108, where he is
seated in a soft chair — the
electrodes carefully hidden
from view.
Terry-Thomas, Dirk Bogarde,
Peter C u s h i n g , Gregory P e c k
and Christopher L e e to name
but a few, have suffered the
same hideous fate — the STOIC
interview. One by one they
have come, had extracts from
their previous films shown and
held in evidence against them.
One by one they leave the
studio shaken, somewhat the
worse for the experience for
the s o l a c e of St George's
H o s p i t a l .
S T O I C deny a l l ; the court
appearances, unpleasant n o i s e s
from the E l e c E n g basement —
they're a l l l i e s . In vain S T O I C
point out that L e s l i e P h i l l i p s
has appeared on national T V
since h i s S T O I C interview a n d ,
contrary to popular opinion,
none of the marks show. They
a l s o point to Barry Humphries
(alias Dame F.dna F.veredge)
who actually cane back for more,
s c a l d i n g h i s interviewer with

hot t e a i n the p r o c e s s .
A l l this i s rather unfair;
S T O I C i s really quite a serious
proposition, and it is in v i e w
of the quality of S T O I C trans-
missions that w e l l known
personalities grace the camera
w i t h s u c h regularity (without
payment).
There are two major series
currently produced by S T O I C :
Film Talk, in which the
aforementioned film stars have
appeared, is a highly s u c c e s s -
ful p r o g r a m m e . It is
transmitted not only in C o l l e g e ,
but also to s c h o o l s , poly-
t e c h n i c s , e t c , v i a the Inner
London Education Authority's
( I L E A ) Channel 7 television
network.
The second production,
Lunchbreak, is S T O I C ' S
raison d ' etre. P r o v i d i n g a
few shy people having their
introverted coating stripped.
Appearing on S T O I C is an
experienced t r a n s c e n d i n g
verbal d e s c r i p t i o n , until
you've tried y o u cannot
understand what makes a good
interviewer. " A spirit of
adventure must be a prerequisite'
and a m a s o c h i s t i c nature i s a
help if you are to see recordings
of yourself played back. One
healthy aspect at S T O I C i s
that no-one w i l l bite your
head off if y o u make a
m i s t a k e , lest the same thing
should happen to them.
It takes guts to make an
interviewer; you have to keep
control o f interview by
considering the replies to your
questions, formulating your
next q u e s t i o n , l i s t e n i n g to the

The Student T e l e v i s i o n of Imperial C o l l e g e (referred to a s
S T O I C ) were not transmitting in C o l l e g e l a s t term a s the t e l e v i s i o n
studio was moving house. However, their transmissions on the
I L E A T V network to s c h o o l s , p o l y t e c h n i c s and other L o n d o n
c o l l e g e s h a s continued to attract attention. T h e most recent
came in the Times Higher Education Supplement (THES) with
an article by Jeremy C l i f t .

S T O I C members tend to
settle into two distinct groups
— infront and behind the
camera. The technical side
(behind camera) c o n s i s t s of
slightly unexpected occupations
such a s cartooning and graphic
design. T h e other side is the
preserve of presenters and
interviewers. It should be s a i d
that those who think they w i l l
be good i n front of a camera
have not a l w a y s turned out s o ;
the reverse is a l s o true with a
avoiding the temptation of
looking down at a n y notes.
Most of S T O I C ' s programmes
are recorded (a fact they would
never divulge to anyone),
although there are often live
programmes. T h i s i s because
there are just too many
parameters i n v o l v e d i n making
