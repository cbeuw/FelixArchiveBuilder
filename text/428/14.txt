The League i s p l a y e d
between five l o c a l c l u b s , e a c h
team playing the others t w i c e ,
one home and one away match.
IC started cautiously by
drawing their first match
against U n i l e v e r . T h e next two
matches were wins for I C
against Silver Wings and the
celibrated Harrow O a k ; the
rest of the matches were
draws. T h e two w i n s , however,
were enough to beat our
nearest opponents, P a r s o n ' s
Green, by one point. IC now
play a team from ICI at
Bracknell (the Southern L e a g u e
winners) for the C u p .
England champion

runs, having bowled out the
opposition for 146. T h i s w a s
followed by an enjoyable game
against Babbacombe, the
result of which w a s lost i n the
post match celebrations.
After the revelry
The 1976 cricket season
began very a u s p i c i o u s l y for IC
with a 234 run victory over
B a l l i o l , Oxford, on May 1st.
Together with the next fourteen
games this produced 11 wins,
3 draws and 1 defeat. These
results were due mainly to
excellent seam bowling by
Messrs Millard and Bramley and
a batting line-up which scored
consistently w e l l .
T h i s good run ended on
9th June when we lost to
K i n g s t o n P o l y . T h i s marked the
start of a bad run for the team,
much weakened by examination
absentees, which only ended on
19th June against Whitton i n the
league, I C winning by 7
w i c k e t s . T h i s put us in a good
frame of mind for the summer
tour.
Enthusiastic tour party
Although not particularly
strong, the touring party w a s
very enthusiastic and we
anticipated doing reasonably
w e l l . However we started off
disastrously at Southampton,
having bowled the opposition
out for 123 (Millard 5 for 57).
IC were then bowled out for
69. We d i d improve on this
performance at Yelverton and a
draw w a s achieved. T h e next
game, against Exeter C C , s a w
one of the best performances
from IC throughout the season.
E x c e l l e n t fielding ensured that
E x e t e r , the 1975 Devon league
champions, were restricted to
141 off-35 overs (Millard 3 for
60 and Sprake 3 for 54). H a l l
was responsible for two
run-outs. Our chances of
victory were lost with the
wickets of Ghosh a n d P a u l .
However a creditable 105 for 8
(off 35 overs) was a c h i e v e d .
Best match
Probably the best match of
the tour w a s against Brinham.
IC declared at 154 for 8
(Sparke 4 1 , Ghcsh 26) setting
the opposition 155 runs in 2
hours. O n a pitch of low bounce
they achieved this target in the
last over Jo reach 157 for 7 ,
Ghosh taking 3 for 39.
After four matches on
consecutive days a tired IC
team lost to P l y m s t o c k by 79
New but successful
N E W L Y F O R M E D , R i d i n g C l u b

last s e s s i o n . T h e aim of the

we operated every Wednesday
afternoon, running both
beginners' and 'advanced'
lessons and a l s o a hack.
T h i s s e s s i o n we w i l l

our probable programme being
advanced team l e s s o n s in the
afternoon and n o v i c e s ' l e s s o n s
in the evening. Our teams
w i l l be competing in the
University of London league —
the matches involving a
dressage test and a show-
jumping c o u r s e .

After the revelry we were
back to cricket against South
Devon. They batted first
scoring 160 for 7 declared.
There w a s no effective
resistance from I C apart from
53 by Ghosh; IC were a l l out
for 86. A t Y e o v i l another
landmark w a s p a s s e d when
A l a n Watling scored h i s first
runs of the tour. Though I C
scored only 105 Y e o v i l were
hard pressed to finish at 107
for 8. Whilst the tour didn't
produce the results we h a d
hoped for, it was enjoyed
thoroughly by a l l .
League century
After the tour we returned to
the league in L o n d o n . A g a i n s t
Motspur P a r k ' s 217 for 8, I C
reached 176 for 9, G h o s h 76
and Mark L a w l e s s 29 being
the main scorers. The following
week saw an I C player score a
century for the first time in
two years, J e h B e s h a w scored
126 in a partnership with
Rob Young (68). IC finished
at 237 for 4 declared.
Morden, to their credit,
went for the runs, but were
a l l out for 184 (D Boyd 5 for
45). T h i s proved to be I C ' s
best w i n in the league and
we eventually finished
midway. T h e rest of the
season contained a few
good performances, notably
against London Transport
and East Barnet V a l l e y .
Overall the 1976 season
has been more s u c c e s s f u l
than most, mainly due to the
tremendous enthusiasm of the
freshers, several of whom
played in the first team.
