Film Editor Paul Ekpenyong looks at some of the Summer's better films
Film crop unscorched despite
long hot Summer
It has been a good summer, the sun
has shone long and continuously,
unfortunately causing a drought. Y e t
despite, or inspite, of this there has been
a good y i e l d from the film crop this
summer.
The Omen stands out the most at the
moment because of the massive publicity
surrounding it since its recent release.
C r i t i c a l l y acclaimed by the press, it
stands out a s the most frightening film
since " P s y c h o " . Strangely compelling,
the tension and terror is deftly, and
slowly built up until strained, taught
nerves come near to breaking point.
Definitely not a film for c h i c k e n s
— even strong men w i l l come away
perspiring.
The Omen stars Gregory peck and L e e
Remick.
L e s s strenuous and miles more
entertaining, Bugsy Malone must rank
as the oddest and most lovable musical
that's ever been made. Set in the gangster
30's with a l l the parts played by
" F U T U R E W O R L D " (Brent Walker, A )
directed by Richard T Heffron;
starring Peter Fonda and Blythe
Danner.
Imagine that your wildest fantasies
have been made possible by technology.
That you c a n , s a y , joust with medieval
knights, fight with Roman gladiators,
satiate your every sexual pleasure or
even s k i on the red snows of M a r s . Then
you have D e l o s , a holiday centre that
makes Buthins look like some primeval
throw-up.
D e l o s h a s been rebuilt after the
carnage at Westworld when sunshinging
robots went out of control and shot-up
guests. The new set-up is declared
totally safe by its creators who invite
the media to look round the establishment.
It i s thus that two hacks of the
media, Tracy B a l l a r d (Blythe Danner)
and Chuck Browning (Peter Fonda)
find themselves exoeriencing the delights
of Futureworld and themselves at D e l o s .
Many important political and public
figures a l s o patronise this ' U t o p i a of
thrills, spiffs and bangs.
Before they depart, however, C h u c k i s
approached by Frenchy, a D e l o s t e c h n i c i a n ,
who warns him of sinister going-ons at
D e l o s . Unfortunately the badies snuff him
out before he c a n s p i l l any more beans.
Anyway,- our two intrepid reporters
(sic) arrive at D e l o s and after much
cavorting about in Futureworld they
bump into Harry. Harry i s one of the few
remaining humans at D e l o s and w a s
children (none of whom are older than
15), it is a superb satire of this genre
of movies. It would immeasurably spoil
your film to tell you any more about it
except to suggest you go and s e e the
film'itself.
On the other hand, however, I w i l l not
mar your enjoyment of C l i n t E a s t w o o d ' s
The Outlaw Josey Wales by telling
you that i t ' s about a man out for revenge.
Wales i s a simple homesteader who
joins a band of renegades to hunt down
the men w h o k i l l e d h i s wife and s o n
and destroyed h i s property. Y e t behind
this deceptively simple story are many
facets of life which are subtly brought
out. A powerful e x p l o s i v e and often
touching film, J o s e y Wales is definitive
of Eastwood a s an actor and a l s o g i v e s
proof of h i s directorial talents.
E q u a l l y powerful and disturbing Is
Michael S o c e s e ' s Taxi Driver. C l i m a x i n g
in devastating, almost s e n s e l e s s , k i l l i n g ,
Taxi Driver g i v e s a bleak portrayal of
what life in N e w York i s a l l about. The
F r e n c h y ' s friend. The trio team up to
find out what is going o n , Harry
eventually gets murdered and in a
fairly spectacular ending, C h u c k and
Tracy fight it out with their doubles.
On the whole, a reasonably enter-
taining film although the acting i s
somewhat nondescript. There are
occasional high spots in the film, for
instance, when Tracy attempts to make
a pass at one of the D e l o s technicians —
unluckily for her he is not progtammed
to respond to sensual stimuli. A s a
sequel to Westworld it is p a s s a b l e ; the
more so with the re-appearance of Y u l
Brynner a s the gunshinging robot.
Futureworld w i l l be on release in October.

T i c k e t s for the current s e r i e s of B B C
R a d i o c l a s s i c a l concerts are now
available from Jen i n the U n i o n O f f i c e
The concerts feature the B B C Symp-
hony Orchestra and are a l l at studios
in Maida V a l e .
sex, v i o l e n c e , degradation, filth, drugs
poverty are brought into stark focus
through the e y e s of a cabby, brilliantly
played by Robert de N i r o .
If this i s a l l getting a bit too heady
for y o u , then take a break and pop
along to see N e i l Simon's Death by
Muder. Not only i s the title absurd, s o
is the f i l m . I mean, what c a n you d o
but laugh yourself s i l l y when a deaf and
dumb maid bursts into the room and tries
to scream about the dead butler? R e a l l y ,
I heard of black humour, but this is
positively the limit.
There are two other films worth
mentioning. They are H i t c h c o c k ' s
Family Plot described by its publicity
as d i a b o l i c a l l y entertaining — more like
d i a b o l i c a l l y self-indulgent if you a s k me.
I've heard of black humour, but this
is positively the limit,
starring Anthony Q u i n n , seems not much
more than the " s p e c t a c u l a r " it i s ! B y e
for now and have a good time.
Refreshing - but
cover versions likely
P h i l l i p Goodhand-Tait - ' O c e a n s
Away' - C h r y s a l i s C H R 1 1 1 3
P h i l l i p G o o d h a n d - T a i t ' s 'Oceans
Away' is one of the most refreshing
albums to break onto the scene for quite
a while, and a s such w i l l no doubt reap
many "cover versions' from its tracks.
Already the title song h a s been recorded
by two well known pop personages, Gene
Pitney and Roger Daltrey. f believe that
O l i v i a Newton-^John h a s a l s o recorded
'Old Fashioned Love', a rather beautiful,
but haunting, ballad from the L P .
P h i l l i p G o o d h a n d - T a i t , o s t e n s i b l y a
songwriter a s opposed to a performer,
happens to write some of the most
amazing songs, w h i c h , had they been
written twenty years ago, would certainly
rate as standards today.
Oceans Away i s h i s first recording
in two years and marks h i s first album for
the C h r y s a l i s label. The L P features ten
songs, each of which has been written in
the old style of songwriting - with the
accent on melody and poetic l y r i c s .
Standout tracks are ' O l d F a s h i o n e d
L o v e ' , ' L o v e ' s L i k e A Song', ' J e w e l ' a n d
the title track. Mingled with the songs are
some interesting string arrangements,
courtesy of Robert Klrby, together with
some fresh production from John B u r g e s s .
The album does not fall into the usual
singer-songwrite rut and makes easy
listening. If you want to get a better
idea of P h i l l i p ' s music come along to
the F r e s h e r ' s concert tomorrow evening
and hear him play.
