There is normally no charge for the

but a deposit is usually required for
private parties and similar functions.
The ICWA lounge is suitable for small
parties, (capacity about 40) and can be
booked through Isobel Donnelly, ICWA
President. 98 Beit Hal I.
Procedure
It you want to book one of the above
rooms, drop into my office (first floor,
Union) ask for a Bookings F o r m . Please
read the section marked "Conditions ot
use". Take particular note of the c l a u s e s :
(1) " T h e person in whose name the
rooom is booked s h a l l be totally respons-
ible for the behaviour of the guests and
should ensure that they leave the room
after the f u n c t i o n " .
(2) (A) " M e s s e s of a human nature
(excreta, vomit, etc) must be cleared u p " .
(The Disciplinary Committee took a very
dim view of certain violations of this
rule last s e s s i o n ) .
(8) " R e p a i r s or restitution resulting
from any damage done to property in the
building and in e x c e s s of the amount of
the deposit s h a l l be paid for by the
a p p l i c a n t " .
P l e a s e also note the advice about s p e c i a l
f a c i l i t i e s (eg stage lighting), insurance
and performing rights l i c e n c e s given on
the form.
Functions w i l l not normally be allowed
to continue after midnight except in the
J C R , which is often bookable until 2am.
Discipline & security matters
This rather difficult topic follows on
naturally from the booking of rooms,
s i n c e it is after functions that un-
pleasantness often occurs. I would warn
everyone using the Union that the E x e c -
utive are not amused by excreta and
vomit in the rooms, by broken furniture,
graffitti on w a l l s , forced doors, smashed
c l o c k s and vandalised telephones that
too frequently accompany the use of
Union rooms, e s p e c i a l l y by certain clubs
and societjes(who s h a l l remain nameless).
We a l s o take a dim view of the defacement
of nomination papers, the tearing down of
notices and " s t r e a k i n g " through the
Union buiIding.
My own powers and r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s are
set out in the Union B y — L a w s . I may
suspend any member ot the Union from
the use of Union f a c i l i t i e s for up to
24 hours. Once I have done this, I
expect the individuals concerned to
leave the building at once. I shall then
O R A N G E
MOLE
use what the law describes as " r e a s o n a b l e
f o r c e " to evict the miscreants; s i n c e I
a m ' of rather slight build and not as
muscular as large F o o t b a l l / R u g b y players
(oops!), I hope that other members of
the Union w i l l a s s i s t me. Brendan, the
Bar Manager, is very handy with the
hurling stick which he keeps behind the
bar, so I don't foresee any difficulties
there!ONLY UNDER THE MOST SERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES WILL I CALL THE
POLICE. The last thing I want is to
give the Union a reputation as a rough-
house — anyone who thinks that this
is in fact what it i s , had better keep
away from the Union before h e / s h e is
suspended.
Noticeboards etc.
P l e a s e respect the Union noticeboards
both old and new. See C h a l k y ' s article
for the P u b l i c i t y R u l e s — these apply to
a l l Union areas. P l e a s e make sure that
posters are removed after the event -
otherwise you will be fined.
Beit Quadrangle
Unfortunately, during the next twelve
months the Quad w i l l look rather
unsightly, since the grass-mud areas
are to be dug up and new drainage instal led.
Then the grass w i l l be reseeded around
Easter and this should be looking good
by next October. P l e a s e keep off these
areas while the work is under way.
Committee rooms
The Union has spent a great deal of
money (over £16,000) in building and
furnishing the Welfare Centre and
Committee Rooms. The latter are the
" B r o w n R o o m " , " G r e e n R o o m " and the
" O r a n g e R o o m " , as above. These rooms
should be used for committee meetings
and small gatherings — please do not ask
for the common room, unless you need
a room for about 50 people.
Defects & complaints
If you have any complaints about the
building or find that something w i l l not
work, eg doors, taps, pinball machines, or
if you come across damaged furniture of
any kind, please come to my office and
enterthe problem In the " d e f e c t s b o o k " .
Keys
Could all holders of keys to Union
rooms please give me a list of the keys
in your p o s s e s s i o n ; eg O p s o c , Dramsoc,
Stoic, J a z z C l u b , A C C , S C C , R C C ,
Scab, Graffitti, etc. I am particularly
interested to know which' keys have been
lost.
Fire & emergency
The College are particularly worried at
present by the danger of bombs being
planted in or near the c o l l e g e . If it is
announced over the public address that a
bomb is suspected in the U n i o n , for
goodness sake — get out(!) through the
nearest exit and round to the other side
of the Albert H a l l , where one is reasonably
sheltered from a blast. After the recent
fire in the Concert H a l l , we're a little
concerned about fire precautions.
P l e a s e take care - no smoking in the
Concert H a l l , e s p e c i a l l y on stage, do
not tamper with any electrical apparatus
and use the ashtrays supplied for your
dog ends. It is a d i s c i p l i n e offence to
tamper with fire extinguishers or hoses
please stop others from using them;
you have been warned!
Union facilities
P l e a s e note the improvements we have
made in the Union this summer; the new
Pool Table, the Photo Booth, the P i n b a l l
Machines and (I hope) the repaired
television (parts are due to arrive any
day at time of writing!). P l e a s e look
after these items! If they do not work,
please refrain from kicking them — or I
might kick you!

Important Customs & Exercise notice
College Administration has asked F E L I X to publicize the
following notice about the temporary exportation of goods:
From the 1st J u l y 1976 the regulation covering temporary
exportation of equipment for repair, modification, up-dating etc,
has been altered to bring it into line with other E E C countries.
The new regulation requires that authorisation from HM
Customs & E x c i s e must be obtained before the equipment is
dispatched from C o l l e g e . F a i l u r e to comply, w i l l result in
difficulty in getting the equipment back into this country, and
is almost certain to involve the payment of duty and V A T . The
new forms required are C & E 1152 and C & E 1153.
Equipment being temporarily exported for use on s c i e n t i f i c
projects abroad can s t i l l be exported on the form X S 140 (XS
140A if being sent by post). T h i s form is used to facilitate easy
re-entry through customs in this country but does not cover the
customs formalities of the country the equipment is being taken
into.
An A T A Carnet is used to cover foreign Customs requirements
in c a s e s where equipment is transported across one or more
frontiers. Departments should note that at least seven d a y s '
notice is required to arrange a Carnet.
If your department is sending equipment abroad please contact
the Foreign Order Section which can offer advice on transport
(quotations etc.), supply the necessary forms, and make sure the
current regulations are observed; they a l s o handle incoming
consignments, and w i l l help with a l l HM Customs and E x c i s e
problems, excluding V A T .
Foreign Order S e c t i o n , Room 407, Sherfield B u i l d i n g . Irft. 3038.
