NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
NEW FORMAT
Let's get the formalities over; Welcome
to IC- this is F E L I X or This is IC,
and you're welcome to FELIX.(At least
one of those should be in the right
order!) To those who are new here,
I hope that this rag, which appears
weekly during term-time, will be as a
guiding light through the mists of
Union and College affairs. And for
those hardy perennials (told you the
fiver would work—P-P), hope you like
the new format. You'd better, 'cause
we've paid for it now.
Seriously though, this edition
represents a double first for F E L I X ,
the first issue to use full process
colour and the first litho-ed U G issue
to use a colour cover. The colour on
the front, and the new banner (doesn't
it look sweet!—varitypist) will become
a permanent feature, paid for by the
advertising-the rate of which amazes
even the bank manager.
Money Matters
Many people have been pressing
for an end to the UGC self-balancing
regulations on catering and residence
accounts, amongst them our own Sir
Brian Flowers. It seems odd that once
again the U G C , a Government body,
should ask universities to perform a
stunt that no Government installation
has recently pulled off. A stunt indeed
for universities to juggle with money
they don't possess. The new measures
are n o t h i n g m o r e than a self-
administered placebo.
For the first time in three years,
refectory price increases do not hog
the headlines of the Fresher's F E L I X .
Mr Mooney's catering has come in for
severe criticism in the last year. It's
all very well knocking his efforts, but
few could do better in his position—it's
not half as easy as it looks. Food
quality has improved in the last year,
although there is still no room for
complacency; many outside concerns
provide comparable bounty without the
long queues.
Constitutionally
The Honarary Secretary's article
came into F E L I X barely a week ago,
literally as the paper went to press.
I learnt then of his d e c i s i o n to
include far-reaching constitutional
changes in the agenda for this
Thursday's Union General Meeting.
These would enable the Union to
sack officers, including sabbaticals,
if circumstances arose where IC
s t u d e n t s wished to do so. The
measures also define the jobs* of
sabbatical officers, particularly with
regard to holiday periods. I welcome
the advent of such measures, although
at the time of writing, I have not
been shown a full copy of the
proposed changes.
H o w e v e r , I am amazed at the
Honarary Secretary's timing. Sabbat-
ical job descriptions and sabbatical
contracts were last discussed at
Council over two years ago. 1 can't
remember these matters being raised
at UGM, and certainly this year's
Executive have not asked for Council
or Union advice in preparing the
changes. The late arrival of Mr.White's
article precluded any extensive
discussion in F E L I X on these
changes.
At most there will be half an hour
spent discussing the changes before
voting at the UGM. That's hardly
enough time to air the subject fully.
Moreover, large numbers of freshers
at the meeting will not know enough
about the Union to assess the
merits of the changes.
I don't question Chalky's good
intentions in bringing up these
measures, they have been sorely
needed for some time. Discuss them
at Thursday's UGM, but let's not
vote on them until a fuller discussion
has taken place.
Discount Discount
Full marks to ICU for undercutting
NUS on the student discount scheme
and passing on half of the commission
(25p) to the students buying the cards.
But where does the other half go?—to
cover admin costs, says ICU. The
permanent staff are salaried and are
paid no extra to handle the cards.
Telephone bills don't come into itfthey
are paid by College anyway)—surely
it can't cost 25p per card to post
details of card purchases to Endsleigh
Street. Is it a g e n u i n e saving for
students or two fingers to NUS?

Safer Insurance
Many of you will, no doubt, be
replying to some of the adverts appear-
ing in F E L I X , particularly the two
insurance companies'. A few years ago
there were some rogues in the business
who spoilt the show for the respectable
operators. ICU has banned the leaf-
letting of halls, and other measures
have weeded out the baddies. Further-
more, when you write to these companies
you are under no obligation—you have
only asked for details. When answering
any advert in F E L I X it helps both us
and the company to quote the paper's
name.
Our Plug
This illustrious, illustrative, and
illuminous (cor!) newspaper would be
half the size and twice as late but for
a deadicated (sic) band of volunteer
staff. F E L I X tries very hard, but is
not a clique. A n y o n e , w h e t h e r
interested or not, be they an academic,
a secretary or a student-, is welcome
to join us. Any degree of involvement
is invited, from writing letters to
pasting up articles to collating after
closing time. After all, it's your
newspaper and if you want to help out
on it, great! Just pop into the office,
or see us at the Freshers' Fair.

FRESHER'S LETTER
(Cotinued from front page)
spending about 10% of the
budget of many other unions*
he told F e l i x . 'Even the CCUs
are given substantially greater
sums from ICU to spend on
their handbooks'. R C S U
did in fact spend £800 on their
handbook this year, with the
Royal College of Science
A s s o c i a t i o n adding a further
£400. L e e d s U n i v e r s i t y , who
like TC, produced 3,000 copies
of their handbook, expect to
subsidise it to the tune of
£4,000 a year.
Impossible schedule
C o l l e g e P u b l i c a t i o n s
Department agreed to the over-
time provided that the Union
guaranteed to reimburse them;
President of the Union, Nick
Brayshaw, agreed to t h i s . In
eight days, Mr Morse turned i n
57 hours overtime to get the
Handbook finished; as F E L I X
Editor C l i v e Dewey s a y s :
'We had eight working days to
complete the magazine, since
by 2nd August FELIX had
recieved none of the Handbook
artwork—impossible without
extensive overtime.'
On the nail, the Handbook
was delivered. One month later
it was s t i l l in Registry waiting
to be put into the mailing.
Jim L e a c h , in charge of the
mailing at Registry, explains
the situation ; 'Normally
I tell everyone to get items
for the mailing to me by mid-
•CCCC'CCCC'C^CC
August. This gives me a Jwo
week leeway before we put the
items actually into the mailing.
This year I was on holiday
until 13th September, so the
mailing wasn't started until I
returned.
Stunned
Neither Mr White nor Mr
Dewey knew of this leeway.
Mr Dewey a g a i n : ' / was rather
stunned to hear that all our
work had been for nothing. Even
one extra week would have
made all the difference. More-
over, I'm certain that it would
have enabled Paul to produce
a much better publication.
'Obviously his working in
Harrods didn't help matters,
but even so the overtime could
have been avoided if we at the
FELIX unit had been better
informed by the Union. As it
was, this office was fully
stretched on the Handbook, and
we relied implicitly on the
information from Mr White.'
Incompetance
Mr Ekpenyong takes a more
acrimonious line: 'It shows
a marked degree of incompet-
ance, on the part of the
Honorary Secretary, that he was
unable to give the correct
completion date. This was
despite my protestations at
the time that Registry had
given me a different final
delivery date. The Union
Executive has once again
shown its low financial
priority on Union publications —
except where things go wrong.'
