Well, this is it! After the long hot
summer which saw most of you waiting
for ' A ' level results, U C C A forms, college
letters, and the start of term, we c a n
now look forward to the Autumn term.
A s you sit reading this F r e s h e r ' s
edition of F E L I X , it is a sobering
thought for you that...you have just
entered one of the true B a s t i o n s of
science and technology. Examiners,
L E A ' s , magistrates and parents w i l l i n g ,
you w i l l spend at least three years here
in the search of knowledge, truth and a
degree. Your three years at University are
often the most formative years of your
life, so let's start forming...
F i r s t l y , let's form some ideas about
me, the President. T h e days of Tom
Brown, Flashman and Rugby School
don't extend to IC U n i o n . Before I w a s
elected to this heady position, (actually
everyone said ' H e r e ' s a likely looking
mug' and then the buggers voted for me),
I was a student in Materials Science,
and, with a sketchy, beer-soden brain
and set of lecture notes, managed to
swing a 2:2 degree. Remember, | am an
ordinary student with the same ideas
and problems as a l l of you - I live in
the student h a l l s (Linstead), I eat in the
same refecs (If I must), drink in the same
bars (usually the Union) and, most
important, scrape a living off the same
grant as you. S o , dont be scared of coming
up and introducing yourself, 'cause I'll
talk to anyone for a pint of ' E ' . Seriously,
I feel that it's important for the President
to be approachable and that is one of
my aims - to meet a s many people as
possible.

CUTTINGS

Now let's get down to some serious
Union business (I'll keep it brief).
F i r s t l y , the Union is not something
from which you c a n divorce yourself.
Without y o u , the U n i o n , by i t ' s very
name, does not e x i s t . Y o u are a member
of the Union and in the same way a s you
w i l l draw benefits from being a member,
the Union draws benefit from your
membership. T h e i s s u e s in which I
become involved must, by n e c e s s i t y , be
those which are of importance to y o u .
Remember that when I make a stand on
Refectories, H a l l s , fees or whatever, I
need your support in providing a platform
for my stand. Y o u know what the next
sentence i s going to s a y , because I
cannot implore you strongly enough to
attend Union meetings. Before you come
to the first meeting (on Thursday) don't
biilId up a preconception that the Union
is full of hacks and that a U G M is
where we plan sit-ins or send telegrams
to A l l e n d e , or Vorster. A U G M has two
functions:
(1) I try to e x p l a i n (in two-syllable
words) what the hell I have been up to.
If you agree with what I have been doing,
or propose to d o , give me the support to
continue.
(2) A U G M is an opportunity for you to
tell me what to do (in both senses) and to
chop me down if I go astray. The U G M
is an arena where a l l you have to do to
get me, or the Union c o l l e c t i v e l y to do
something, is to put your hand in the air
and speak your mind.
Remember, your language won't shock
me - if you want to stand up and tell me
what a lousy, foul-mouthed rat-bag I am
then go ahead (you'll get a hell of a
reply, by the w a y ) . A l s o if y o u want to
throw bouquets (or money) then feel free.
A l l you have to d o i s come to the meeting
and put your hand in the a i r . Enough of
this Union b u s i n e s s . . .
L a s t l y , I try to write these articles
every week — some weeks they are
extremely boring, the other weeks i t ' s
just plain boring. Read it though, at
least y o u ' l l know I'm s t i l l around.
Another way y o u ' l l know I'm around is
if you s e e someone w h i z z past you with a
red A u s t i n Mini or no clothes or both...it's
me.
WELFARE MATTERS
The Welfare Centre i s
situated at the top of the
Union B u i l d i n g (turn left on
emerging from the lift), and i s
open 12.30 to 1.30pm Monday
to F r i d a y . There y o u c a n find
information o n topics ranging
from landlord problems to
contraception - from getting
legal a i d to student d i s c o u n t s .
We also have a supply of tube

The U n i o n Solicitor can also
be consulted v i a the Centre or
The U n i o n Office. T h e Centre
is also on the phone —
internal: 2898.
There w i l l be a stall at the
Freshers F a i r ( l s t floor)
where y o u c a n s e e the kind of
information the Centre h a s .
Help
P l e a s e drop by if you would
like to help out at the Centre
once a week. Another somewhat
important point — our intended
Welfare Officer, having f a i l e d
to return, l e a v e s one of our
most vital Union posts vacant.
The job could best be filled
by 2nd years upwards. Anyone
who 'is interested come and
have a chat with me about
what i s i n v o l v e d . I c a n be
found v i a the Centre or the
Union O f f i c e .

WARNING
The National Westminster Bank, local Police and
Security Officers at Imperial College are becoming
increasingly concerned at the number of thefts of
cheque books, cheque cards and credit cards taking
place on the College Premises. In the main thefts
occur from jackets left unattended in offices and
lecture rooms.
We ask all customers to ensure that all such items
are kept quite separately on their persons and that
every precaution is taken to safeguard them at all
times.
