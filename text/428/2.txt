2 - F E L I X , O C T O B E R 4th 1976
Whilst you've been away many things
have been happening and F E L I X has
done its best to keep everyone at I C i n
the picutre. There have been two P o s t
Graduate editions of F E L I X , one on
July 30th and the other on September 17th.
Summer Accomodation
The first of these editions reported
that the C o l l e g e Summer Accommodation
Scheme, whereby Southside and L i n s t e a d
H a l l rooms are let out to tourists and
conference guests, was being run on
new lines to ensure that the scheme w a s
more financially watertight, than had
hitherto been the c a s e .
However there were teething troubles,
as our front page story reported. P r e -
valent amongst these w a s the question
of unused meal t i c k e t s . When tourists
book a room at Southside they have to
buy a Â£1 meal ticket which they exchange
for breakfast in the refectory. Many
visitors leave unused tickets in their
rooms when they finally depart. These
tickets had i n the past been used by
student cleaners. Amidst some confusion
this practice w a s stopped by Domestic
Secretary Captain L i n d l e y .
There was a l s o some uncertainty at
to how much the cleaners should be
paid; at the end of the first week they
got 7p l e s s than last year! Nevertheless
praise has been forthcoming on the
d e c i s i o n to appoint a permanent S A C
Manageress, T r i c i a Wigfall, instead of
the usual nine month appointment.
Sport
Term had barely ended when news of
a different sort filtered through from
Henley and Montreal. T h e Boat C l u b
had a most s u c c e s s f u l year at the
Henley R o y a l Regatta, with our l s t VIII
reaching the quarter f i n a l s of the L a d i e s
P l a t e and the 2nd VIII being beaten only

SUMMER NEWS ROUND-UP
Montreal
At the Montreal O l y m p i c s T i m Crooks
a former post graduate student i n the Mech-
anical Engineering's Lubrication Labora-
tory, won a silver medal i n the rowing
eights. T w o other members of the depart-
ment, N e i l Keron (coxless fours,rowing)
and Dr Graham P a u l (fencing) were not a s
s u c c e s s f u l .
Student Houses
During the vacation rennovation work
was carried out on some of the student
houses owned by the C o l l e g e . D e l a y s i n
commencing the work brought fears that 51
and 69 E v e l y n Gardens, together with 14
Queensbury P l a c e would not be ready for
student occupation at the start of term.
In the second P G F e l i x we reported that
quick action by C o l l e g e officials and
Union President N i c k Brayshaw had unex-
pectedly enabled the work to be speeded up,
The work has now finished in E v e l y n Gar-
dens, and students started moving in last
week.
Tricia Greenwood
Residence Officer T r i c i a Greenwood
resigned i n August. T a l k i n g to F e l i x about
her d e c i s i o n she complained about the
understaffing of R e s i d e n c e Office and the
refusal of C o l l e g e Administration to do
anything about it.
Blazes
The first of two main fires took place
on July 15th, when a faulty lift motor
caught fire, c a u s i n g the whole of Southside
to be evacuated for 30 minutes. Damage
was minor. T w o months later the stage of
the U n i o n Concert H a l l w a s being sanded
when one of the dust bags being used
caught f i r e . P a n d o r a T h e a t r e ' s Andy Steph-
enson and I C Union D P Derrick Everett
were the heroes, whose prompt action c o n -
fined damage to four square feet of stage
floor.
Clem
RSM Union mascot C l e m , a 1926 Morris
Commercial lorry, is off the road following
transmission failure at Portsmouth. C l e m
had gone South to take part i n the Isle o f
Wight R a i l w a y Centre's Summer Show. A t
the time this meant that a l l three C C U
motorised mascots were off the road.
RCS'
It was with regret that F e l i x had to rec-
ord the deaths of two well-known R C S U
personalities, R o n K i l l and J a n V i n c e n t .
On both a Coroner's verdict of accidental
death was recorded.
