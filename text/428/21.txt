<j | - scheduled overleaf for the very low premium of £2 p.a. (up to £500 cover).

°- Baggage insurance for holidays in Europe, up to 60 days in a year.

•^r; Also your Personal Liability to third parties, including for instance any
accident you might cause on the sports field.
NOTE—Since the scheme is operated through Insurance Brokers, you have the
free use of their services in the event of a claim : they regard you as their
client and represent your interests without charge. (They cannot, of course,
help if your claim is invalid : see conditions overleaf).
