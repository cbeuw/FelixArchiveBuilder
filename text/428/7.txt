F E L I X , O C T O B E R 4th 1976
John (Chalky) White, H o n . Secretary.
Strong, silent, intensely uncontroversial
and self-styled Mr Nice G u y . A gluey
sort of person and sometimes a stickler
for the rules, he should give a lot of
cohesion to the Union All-Stars team
this year, by gum. A great passer of the
ball and a midfield dynamo to boot. One
of the best centre-halfs in the game, his
shooting power might be suspect because
he wears plimsoles.
Ambition: to dispel the myth that he is
just a soap powder.
Chris Morrell, R C S U President: T h e
Union's secret weapon; so secret that no
one really knows, not evett C h r i s herself.
Giggles at random and thus i s considered
to have a large distraction potential on
the field. Would probably be sent off if
she tittered whilst a penalty w a s being
taken. Tipped for stardom next year
(stir, stir).
Used to wear knickers.
Ambition: to discover who "ripped off"
her knickers in the first place and
kindly donated them to the Union Bar.
Steve Dearing, C & G U President: T h e
Union All-Stars pet gorilla. Rumoured to
have difficulty in thinking a n d k i c k i n g
the ball at the same time. H a s a lot of
potential, but is expected only to put in
guest appearances due to e x c e s s i v e
commitments with his home team.
Wears a wig.
Ambition: to overcome his precarious
position's jinx and actually get an ACGI.
A . N . Other, RSMU P r e s i d e n t : T h e Union
team's mystery player. T r a g i c a l l y due to
brain damage, Martin L e v y the RSMU
President-elect, has h a d to pull out of
the squad at the request of h i s home
team's board of directors. A great pity.
Had planned to change the refreshment
at half-time from oranges to a firkin of
beer per man. Would have been the biggest
drunk in the league.
Wore a girdle once only.
Ambition: to get back into Mines?
Spectators
L e t us now make a quick perusal through
the l i k e l y spectators who w i l l probably
be watching the matches with avid
interest.
Jen Hardy-Smith, P r e s i d e n t ' s A s s i s t a n t .
Refuses to take sides despite much
pleading from both c a m p s . B r i n g s on the
oranges at half-time and carries off the
wounded when injuries occur. Tremendously
s k i l l e d at nursing a n d reviving dead
and dying egoes.
Wears a tie every Friday.
Ambition: to get home regularly from
Council meetings before 10 pm.
Brendan Clements, Union B a r Manager:
Semi-bearded leprechaun from D u b l i n ' s
fair c i t y . T a l k s a lot, but would probably
argue a l l night that he does not. R e f u s e s
to take sides despite much c a j o l i n g . Off
the f i e l d he i s shy and retiring except at
Chem E n g F r e s h e r s ' Dinners. Removes
his left boot when losing at C o c k - a - l e e k y .
Wears the same five ties ever week.
Ambition: to retire one day and become
a professional Guiness drinker.
C l i v e Dewey, Editor of F E L I X . Screams
to take the field for the Union A l l - S t a r s
but so far without much s u c c e s s . A n
inconsistent header of the b a l l . Writes
colourful and sensational match reports in
his spare time when not shouting
encouragement from the touchline.
B e l i e v e s in l i a i s o n whenever it i s
p o s s i b l e .
Wears a FELIX T-shirt.
Ambition: to produce at least thirty-five
match reports this year and hence set a
new record.
Ted F i s h e r , former N U P E Secretary: H a d
apparently been under c r i t i c i s m from
certain d i s s a t i s f i e d sections of h i s own
team for allegedly and needlessly helping
the C o l l e g e A l l - S t a r s . A veteran striker,
he rs an asset to every team that he i s
a s s o c i a t e d with.
Wears a parking warden's hat.
Ambition: to get a new hut.

I
The Author: (Blush) Resident c y n i c . X
Nobody's friend (sob). The most unpopular T*
man in the league when this article h a s Â£
been read (wail, sob). P r o m i s e s not to
write any more nasty, spiteful contro- -^C
v e r s i a l articles for F E L I X despite their
journerlissic eggserlense (extended
throaty w a i l , sobji Is reputedly open to
bribes however.
Wears armour plating from now on.
Ambition: to prevent just one person in
his department from identifying him as
the author of this load of drivel.
i
So there it i s : the crowds have returned
and the two teams are coming out of the
dressing rooms just raring to go. A point
worth noting i s that although both the
teams are on the pitch waiting for the 4c
kick-off, some members may try to deny C
all knowledge of playing football or T*
even cricket. In the event of this happening J
humour them politely.
W.M. (anag).
