Imperial College Union Careers Fair
Introduction
This coming Monday and Tuesday, sees the
return of the Imperial College Union Careers
Fair. Both the Great Hall and the Junior
Common Room (JCR) in the Sherfield building
will be filled with companies looking for you!
The companies attending this year cover the
range of job opportunities available to graduates,
from the Armed Forces to the Civil Service,
from statistics to engineering, from accountancy
to consultancy. If you have decided the career
you want to pursue, you will probably find a
company at the Careers Fair that is active in that
area. If not, there are a wide range of companies
to talk to.
The graduate recruitment market has been very
slow in the last few years, but the economic
climate is beginning to change and so will the
job market, eventually. Companies are still
recruiting, even i f it is in smaller numbers than
four years ago during the boom.
Even i f you are not in your final year, come
along to the Careers Fair and talk to the
employers. If nothing else it will get you used to
doing it in future years.
The Careers Fair brochure, available during the
event, has more information on each of the
exhibitors and more details on the services
provided by the IC Careers Service.
Make the most of the Careers Fair. It is there for
the benefit of all the students at the College and
anyone else who has graduated recently.
