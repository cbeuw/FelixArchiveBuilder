R i s k . It isn't always
w h e r e y o u expect it to be-
You are standing at the edge of your
future. If there is one thing you can be sure to
expect, it's the unexpected.
How you deal with risk—those risks you
see and those you don't—will shape your future.
N o firm understands the nature of risk
better than Bankers Trust. Risk is what we deal
with everyday. Risk, and its gratifying counter-
part, reward.
This is why the opportunities that await
you at Bankers Trust are more stimulating than
others. W e know you didn't come this far to
settle for something easy or something boring or
something you'll eventually want to change.
Bankers Trust careers have change built in.
Change and growth. A n d risk. If you wish to
