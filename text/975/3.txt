College Mourns Loss
Of Student
BY PAUL DIAS
Imperial College is in mourning
after I-Cheung Lee, a second year
student in the department of
Mathematics, died after attending
football trials.
I-Cheung was taking part in the
trials at Imperial College's
Harlington sports ground last
Wednesday when he complained of
having a headache. He was taken to
the pavilion, where he collapsed.
He was not taking part in a game at
the time.
The member of the St John's
Ambulance on duty at the ground
arranged for Mr Lee to be rushed to
Hillingdon Hospital where he was
put on life support. He was
diagnosed as suffering from a
severe brain haemorrhage. There
Walkway
Work
BY JOE MCFADDEN
Plans to develop the walkway
alongside the Junior Common
Room in the Sherfield Building
should be finalised within two
months, according to Imperial
College Union President, Andrew
Wensley.
Proposals for the development
of the walkway were first made last
February. The changes would turn
the walkway into a mini-mall, the
aim of which being to provide
additional services such as a
launderette or an optician.
A feasibility study is currently
under way and once negotiations
between the Imperial College and
Imperial College Union are
completed, plans for the changes
can be drawn up.
In an interview with Felix, M r
Wensley said that: "at the moment
we're only considering developing
the stores and alcove area behind
the JCR,". He added that the wall
of the JCR might have to be put
back a little.
The development of shop outlets
on the walkway was one of the
election promises made by M r
Wensley while running for the
position of President.
was no apparent reason for the
haemorrhage, which was sudden
and unexpected.
Mr Lee's parents were contacted
in Taiwan and arrived in England
on Saturday. Due to the inoperable
nature of his condition, the decision
was then made to disconnect the
life support systems. Mr Lee was
cremated on Wednesday afternoon.
The funeral was attended by many
friends and family. One of those
present said that "it was a cohesive
community. Many young people
attended."
Dr Jacobs, I-Cheung's personal
tutor, described Mr Lee as "a very
quiet sort of fellow and quite
withdrawn. He was a very nice
young man and very gentle. It's a
very sad business."

River Traffic Control
If you thought the weather was bad
in London this week, spare a
thought for the poor rowers in
Cambridge. Members of the
University rowing club were
confronted not only with a
bursting-at-the-seams River Cam
but also with a request to only row
in one direction when passing under
one of the Cam's many bridges!
The bridge in question is currently
festooned with scaffolding, causing
a build-up of traffic on the river.
The one-way ruling still hasn't
solved the congestion problem,
though, and the next step may be to
install traffic lights on the bridge.
Alarms!
The Students' Union at the
University of Wales College at
Cardiff has been giving out free
rape alarms. This follows a
incidents of flashers reported
around some of the halls of
residences. Free rape alarms can be
obtained from the Imperial College
Union Office on production of your
student identification card.

Ex-smokers could be interested in a

Medical Journal this week.
Researchers have found that
aubergines contain three times as

Be Vigilant
College Security are advising
members of Imperial College to be
more vigilant with their belongings.

weeks in the number of wallets and
credits cards reported stolen.
