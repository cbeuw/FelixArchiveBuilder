26 Editorial & Letters
Editorial
Read the small print.
The Islam debate seems to have manifested itself
in quite a big way on the pages of Felix already
this year. No surprise, really, especially if you
were fortunate enough to experience it for much
of last year. As far as I can remember, nothing
ever resulted from the letters for and against,
except more letters for and against and it appears
to be heading in the same direction this year. If a
conclusion cannot be reached after a year of
'discussion', what is it going to achieve if I
continue it for possibly another year?
Apologies to those short-sighted people who
may be finding it difficult to read the letters on
the opposite page. The volume of the response
to just one of the letter from last week was, as
you can see, quite large and the only way to fit
everything into the space available was to shrink
the point size. No-one really wants to read the
same arguments week in, week out, so as of this
week, I wont be printing any more letters about
this particular issue, and that's the end of it.
Fish and Chips
On a lighter note, when was the last time you
had fish and chips? In my first year here, about
three years ago, you used to be able to buy chips
from a place in college called Mustafa's. Much
to the sadness of many of the inhabitants of
Imperial, it closed down during that year.
You've probably all seen the place where it used
to be - the room at the end of Southside Upper
Lounge (above the bar). It was great when the
bar had kicked out and you fancied something to
eat - Mustafa's chips fitted the bill perfectly. But
now there's nowhere near that does take-away
fish and chips (apparently some ancient council
bye-law forbids the sale of them). Maybe it's
about time someone thought about doing
something about it; I'm sure there are plenty of
people out there who'd love to have a load of
chips to go with their pint.
Whoops!
Did you spot the extra puzzle on the Puzzle Page
in last week's Felix! I appear to have omitted
the last clue from the set of down clues. Sorry
about that, I know how frustrating it can be not
being able to finish a crossword when all the
clues are there. B y having one clue missing,
there's no hope of finishing it.
In case you are desperate to know what the
clue was or if you are just plain interested, the
clue should have been:
23. Raves about goalkeeper, perhaps. (5)
Apologies to John Westwater for the small (well,
quite major really) screw-up. Hopefully this
week's crossword is free of bugs. If it isn't, you
can always give the Felix Office a ring on ext
3515 and we'll let you know what it should have
been. One thing we won't do, however, is let
you know what any of the answers are - you'll
have to wait for the next issue of Felix to find
out.
Thanks must go to Jaymz and Tamsin at IC
Radio for the scribble pad idea. They were also
the ones who phoned up on Friday and pointed
out the small omission from last week's
crossword.
For those who did attempt the last crossword,

Sorry Clive,
Dudley's even
older
Dear Madam,
Your correspondent, Mr Cohen (8th October)
is wrong in believing he is the oldest student at
IC. I first arrived here while on demob leave in
1949 when we had two 'Fresh Young Ladies'
(no votes for the under 21s) out of 800 students,
mainly ex-service, at Guilds, some 1800 in the
whole of IC.
There were fewer lectures but hardly any of
the visual aids and course notes that I find
available now so I suspect tht the work level
was about the same.
I remember the FIRST issue of Felix, one of
the articles began a series on students' cars. It
was,a short series because there were very few
student cars but I remember a friend buying an
Austin 7 No K R 3949 for £60, he called in
j C Y N after the girl he met at an IC Saturday
night hop. Those hops sparked off four
marriages that I went to in '52/'53.
I await with interest the publication of a
letter showing that I am not the oldest student
here.
Yours faithfully,
Dudley Parker.
Something
Constructive
On The Islam
Debate?
Dear Miss Land,
Over the last year the Islam vs. Rest-of-the-
World debate overtook the letters pages of
Felix. Personally I couldn't give a stuff about
this debate and would like to see a bit of
variation on this year's pages.
If there are at least 20 people out there who
care about the debate, may I suggest that a more
productive way of debating the issue (and on a
more regular basis than once a week) would be
to see the Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
and form a 'Debating Islam' society - only 20
signatures needed.
Look, I don't mind you debating it, just don't
do it on the letters pages of Felix, it's getting
tediously boring. I know many share this
opinion, so please take the hint.
Yours looking-forward-to-something-new-
and-interesting-on-the-letters-page,
Marc Ellis
