Hater
When I first looked at Hater, one thing caught
my eye ... Soundgarden! When I first listened to
the album it seemed to have the feeling of half
drunkenness generally associated with grunge.
The guitarists played with a certain 'feeling',
(my neighbour says sloppiness), driving basic
riffs down my earholes at a volume which must
have killed more of my thinking brain than the
whole of Freshers' Week.
The album starts out with 'Mona Bone
Jakon', a song where noise prevails. John
McBain and Ben Shepherd's guitars stomp all
over the grooves and end in enough guitar
feedback to plaster anyone on the wall. 'Who
Do I K i l l ?' follows the same pattern of
grunginess with the psychotic chaos of a mass
murderer, while 'Lion And Lamb' displays the
bandmembers instrumental skills. The rest of
the album plunges deep into mediocrity,
showing that grunge is really a rehash of the
seventies. If you like predictable music recorded
with the worst equipment around, do yourself a
favour and either: a) Buy this record or
b) Get a lobotomy. (6)

eve's plum
envy
Debbie Harry's dreaming. A new decade, the
eighties, and Blondie's just a glimmer in some
yesterday's eye. This evening, walking back
through Greenwich Village, she slid
anonymously past the pink graffitied doors of
one of the new/old punk hangouts. Who's
playing? Some weirdo noise artists who hate
their guitars and call themselves Sonic Youth. In
bed she tosses and turns. Her voice, their new
music - a whole new gravy train.
And this album isn't that album, it's another,
and they've managed to find in Colleen Fitz-
Patrick a vocalist to recreate those glassy tones.
eve's plum sound like two bands squashed onto
the same stage. The music can be fiery. 'Blue'
and 'Once Twice' are ripped through with guitar
licks, slides and tinkling cathedral melodies but
riding with these lyrics, that voice? Colleen
sounds like a little kid hanging out with her big
sister's rock friends. When she growls "I know
that I'll sink into Hell" during 'On The Outside'
the urge is to pat her on the head and hand the
mic back to K i m Gordon. It's all or nothing
when you bite that apple. (6)

Oyster Band
Holy Bandits
Folk music comes in two containers marked
either 'traditional' or 'rock'. In the case of the
Oyster Band, their tradition is Celtic and they
manage that very well. 'The Road To Santiago'
uses the whistle and snare drum and sounds
vaguely like 'Look Away Dixieland' in places.
Other traditional notables include the ballad
story form of 'Rambling Irishman' and the
pubalong of 'Here's To Y o u ' . Now this is all
well and sweet; oh for a full album's worth. But
then the old trap of sounding like Chris de
Burgh is sprung. The curse is seen on 'Gone
West' and 'We Shall Come Home', which both
pan the depths of AOR.
Overall, it's another very mixed catch which
leaves me wondering whether it's only the
American folkies who can avoid falling between
the two stools. We all know that the celtic strand
of music has been well explored but where are
the bands who are developing it for the now as
opposed to the then. (5)
