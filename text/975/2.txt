Fresher
Arrested
BY ANDREW TSENG,
NEWS EDITOR
In what could be described as the
shortest academic career at
Imperial College, a fresher has
been suspended for a year.
Adetola Oshinaike, who was
enrolled for a course in the
Chemical Engineering department,
started causing mayhem on his
arrival at Garden Hall on Saturday
2nd October. His behaviour upset
both the cleaners and the Warden
of Garden Hall, Simon Walker.
By Monday, he was being
reported for disciplinary action.
However, Monday evening saw
him being the cause of several
disturbances in Beit Quad and the
Union Building. The evening's
disruption started after he
attempted to get into the Union
Building without a ticket for the
Freshers' Carnival. Imperial
College Union Stewards managed
to keep him out after a brief scuffle.
He was later seen climbing through
a window in the back of the Union
Building.
There then ensued a chase
resulting in M r Oshinaike being
surrounded by 17 members of
College and Union staff in the
Union Bar. Before being thrown
out of the Union Building and
whilst in the process of being
restrained, M r Oshinaike assaulted
several Union Stewards, Dave
Goddard, the Deputy President
(Finance and Services) and senior
security officer Terry Sweeney.
M r Oshinaike's threatening
behaviour did not subside during
the week. In the early hours of
Tuesday morning, he acted i n a
threatening manner to various
members of Garden Hall. At 9am
he was arrested for disorderly
behaviour, breach of the peace and
obtaining money by menaces.
Gordon Marshall, Director of
Estates, was at the scene: "It was
the Warden who called the police. I
just happened to turn up when the
police were there."
The police released Adetola
Oshinaike after cautioning him for
disorderly behaviour. Following a
College disciplinary on Friday 8th
October, he was suspended from
College for the period of one year.
Fungal Pour?
Free Cycle Coding
Imperial College Union Rag has begun its Fungal Spore '94 campaign with vigour.
On Saturday 9th October, Rag had its first big event, the annual 'Tiddlywinking Down Oxford Street'. A total of
Â£647.28 was raised, with Imperial College students on hands and knees flicking discs of plastic down the busy
London street. The start was dampened slightly with rain threatening to ruin the fun. However, as the day
progressed, the rain did subside. Jane Hoyle, Rag Chairman, said: "It was a bit tiring and a bit damp, but it was
really goodfun... it was a good day."
Rag's next major event is the annual 'Live Monopoly Around London' which will take place tomorrow.
Everyone is welcome. Those interested should meet in Beit Quad at 10am. See page 21 for further details.
Selecting
Union
Stewards
BY THE NEWS T E A M
Those attending events at Imperial
College Union could be meeting
new faces at the gate as the final
selections take place for jobs as
Imperial College Union Stewards.
However, many applicants could
be disappointed. Dave Goddard,
Deputy President (Finance and
Services) said that: "there have
been far more applicants than
places."
One change that has occurred
since last year is the management
of the stewards. Following the
appointment of an Events and
Marketing Manager, Imperial
College Union Stewards will not be
managed by the Deputy President,
as was the case last year. Instead
they will come under the
jurisdiction of the Events and
Marketing Manager.
The new position, has been
introduced as a result of Imperial
College Union reforms that have
been spearheaded into place by last
year's President, Chris Davidson.

Former Student
Transported Back
BY JOE MCFADDEN
A former student of Imperial
College has come full circle.
Returning to the college after
almost twenty-five years absence,
Brian Martin has joined the
University of London Centre for
Transport Studies here at Imperial
College.
Brian Martin's long and varied
experience in Transport Research
will be drawn on by the Centre in
its studies of rail and road travel.
The work will eventually be used
by the European Commission in
planning the development of future
land-based transport links. This will
involve consultations with
government departments and other
research institutions throughout
Europe.
Mr Martin's appointment as an
Honorary Research Fellow reunites
him with an old colleague, Project
Director Professor Tony Ridley.
The two have worked together on a
number of projects over the years,
including the planning of the Tyne
and Wear Metro.
