F
or me, there is no
compound word in the
English language more
unpleasant or off-putting
that ‘heartwarming’. Call me
misanthropic if you want, but I
think my heart is at a perfectly
good temperature, thank you. If I
wanted a heart served warm then
I am more inclined to speak to
Fergus Henderson than to head
down to the cinema. Now, even
those patient readers amongst you
would now be inclined to throw
up their hands and refuse to read
on: ‘what kind of miserable review’,
they may cry, ‘could we expect from
someone whose idea of a fun night
is watching Michael Haneke films
and contemplating death?’ But fear
not, dear readers; as you may have
gleaned from the rating above, I
actually found Brooklyn – despite
the bright colour palate, the syrupy
score, despite, in other words, of its
obvious heartwarming qualities –
really pretty enjoyable.Trust me,I’m
just as surprised as you.
Adapted by Nick Hornby from
the Colm Tóibín novel, Brooklyn
tells the tale of Eilis (Saoirse
Ronan), a young shop-worker from
a small Irish town, who is instructed
by her mother to pack up her bags
and travel across the Atlantic to
America, leaving behind her only
sister. Beginning her life again
in Brooklyn, with a job at a large
department store, she begins to
piece things together; overcoming
the crushing homesickness she
feels, she enrols at night college,
and meets Italian-American Tony
(Emory Cohen), with whom she is
soon deeply in love. Of course, any
plotline that carried on in such a
sweet manner would be unpalatable,
even to the normal movie-goer,
and just when it seems that all is
going well, disaster calls her back
to Ireland, where she falls in love
again – this time with a native Irish
lad, who has a modest fortune,
and is played by handsome rogue
Domhnall Gleeson to boot.
So now our Eilis is faced with
a crushing choice: be appallingly
satisfied in Brooklyn, or be
appallingly satisfied in Ireland.
As you may guess, this film is
far from Sophie’s Choice. Indeed,
the unquestioning nicety of her
suitors begins to get a little grating,
and this reviewer longed for the
much-needed injection of drama
an unwanted pregnancy or back-
street abortion could bring. So, we
understand that the film suffers
from a serious lack of bleakness,
which is for me a serious defect –
but what about it is good? Well,
for starters there’s Saoirse Ronan,
who is fast becoming one of the
most exciting Irish talents to grace
our screens. Eilis is constantly
troubled by the situation around
her, and Ronan’s face conveys the
tumultuous emotions churning
inside as she struggles to adapt
to her situation state-side. Julie
Walters is cast well as Eilis’ terse
(but also warm, obviously) landlady.
Like the cannon at the end of the
1812 Overture, someone of Walters’
calibre is wheeled on is when the
audience demands a big, bombastic
show, and she certainly delivers,
with jokes about Jesus and nylons
coming in quick succession.
The cinematography is handled
excellently by Yves Bélanger, who
was responsible for Wild and Dallas
Buyers Club; interior scenes are

I longed for
a much-
needed
injection of
drama into
this film
Love in the time of diaspora
Saoirse Ronon lights out for the territories in this somewhat syrupy love story
bathed in a warm, glowing light,
while outside the clothing colours
contrast with both sides of the
churning Atlantic’s waters. Director
John Crowley does a solid job, and
while there are no shots that are
especially memorable, or would
seem out of place in any number of
historical dramas, the performances
teased out of his cast reveal a sure
and steady hand behind the camera.
Ultimately, however, Brooklyn
loses out because of its leaning
towards sentimentality. Tóibín’s
novel does not shy away from
the sheer psychological trauma
moving half-way across the world
can wrought, and his handling of
the Irish diaspora experience never
feels celebratory, but is instead
shot through with a searing sense
of melancholy. In the film, such an
issue does not seem to present itself.
Eilis seems to – apart from an early
scene of homesickness – be equally
at home in both worlds. We hear
a lot of the destitution in Ireland
from the characters themselves,
but the pretty village streets of
Eilis’ native town belie this fact.
Sapphic indications in the book
– an important theme of Tóibín’s
– are removed in favour of a much
more straightforward missionary-
style approach to sexuality. Eilis’
character is so incredibly passive –
she leaves home nearly immediately
at her mother’s request, and there is
the sense that Tony isn’t actually her
soul-mate, but instead the first man
in Brooklyn to take an interest in
her – that the fact we go along with
her for the ride shows the strength
of Ronan’s talent.
While Brooklyn is nothing but
heartwarming,the efforts of the cast
and director manage to stop it from
melting into unappealing mulch –
John Crowley is no Richard Curtis,
thankfully. Saoirse Ronan is by far
the most interesting aspect of the
film, which only cements her well-
founded reputation for nuanced
performance. If you need a film to
take your granny to this week, or
something to put in a loved one’s
stocking come Christmas,you could
certainlydoalotworsethatBrooklyn.
Viewers of a Bergmanesque
persuasion will probably avoid the
film at all costs, but if – like me –
they go along for the ride, chances
are they will shamefully, appallingly,
shockingly come to enjoy it.
Documentary corner: Bowling for Columbine
Ben Collier
Film Writer
M
ichael Moore’s
documentaries have
always been divisive.
For the most part,
people’s opinions of his films seem
to be based on their pre-existing
political leanings; it’s no secret that
Moore, as a documentarian, is far
from objective. But opinions aside,
what makes Bowling for Columbine
great is the depth and complexity
with which it explores its chosen
issues.
From the title, one might expect
the film to be solely a focused
exploration of the Columbine High
School massacre. This is far from
true. The shooting merely acts as
a jumping off point for Moore to
expertly explore a number of other
topics, primarily the dangerous
combination of firearms and fear in
modern day America.
On the 20th
of April 1999, the
small county of Jefferson, Colorado,
was subject to one of the worst mass
shootings in American history.High
schoolers Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold shot and killed 13 students
and teachers before turning their
guns on themselves. Unfortunately,
Columbine is now just one in a long
line of gun massacres in the U.S.:
from the Aurora shootings to Sandy
Hook, the debate around gun-
control continues to this day. This
speaks to the continued relevance
and importance of this film.
With a British anti-gun mind-set
it is often infuriating to see Moore
debate with NRA members and
gun advocates. If anything, the film
perhaps places too little emphasis
on the link between gun ownership
and gun-related homicides. Moore
is clearly more focused on his main
argument – the one against fear-
mongering in the American media.
This is not necessarily a bad thing
however, and Moore should be
applauded for the sheer breadth
of interviews and segments he has
assembled in order to make the
argument.
Two interviews that really stand
out, and place this film amongst
some of the best documentaries of
all time, are those conducted with
Marylyn Manson and Charlton
Heston. Manson’s interview in
particular is such a highlight that
if you don’t have time to watch the
whole film I’d advise seeking it out
on YouTube.
The interview itself follows a
section discussing the various
scapegoats used to explain the
behaviour of Eric & Dylan with
everything from violent video games
to action films being blamed by
America’s conservative news media.
In his interview Manson gives us
insight into accusations made about
him at the time whilst making some
of the best points in the film. When
Moore asks Manson what he would
say to the boys if he had the chance
one quote in particular stands out;“I
wouldn’t say a single word to them,
I would listen to what they have to
say and that’s what no one did”.
Bowling for Columbine is
incendiary, thought provoking, and
yet very watchable. Ironic, dark
humour is sprinkled throughout as
Moore retains his unique style of
film-making.It would be impossible
here to touch on even half of the
points made in this film – Bowling
for Columbine really is essential
viewing.

he main way we notice
time passing is not that
you yourself are getting
older, but rather that
everyone else is getting younger.
This is not going to be a problem
for Malala Yousafzai; already, at the
tender age of 18, she has blogged
about Taliban control of Pakistan
for the BBC,survived an attempt on
her life, during which she was shot
in the head, and last year won the
2014 Nobel Peace Prize,making her
the youngest winner in the award’s
history. And you thought managing
to put your underwear on the right
way round this morning was an
achievement.
Following the publication of her
memoirs two years ago – a children’s
version of which came out last year
– it seems that a film was somewhat
inevitable, and Davis Guggenheim,
director of Oscar-winning An
Inconvenient Truth, has stepped up
to the plate.
He Named Me Malala takes its
title from the fact that Yousafzai’s
father named her after an Afghan
folk hero who stood up to British
invaders, and paid with her life.
It seems to have become a self-
fulfilling prophecy.
Her father, an educator in
Pakistan, obviously encouraged her
from an early age, and while the
extent to which her father shaped
her destiny is somewhat explored
here, it never really digs too deep,
remaining firmly on the surface.
Taking as its starting point
Malala living safely in Birmingham,
the film then follows a looping
pattern, weaving in and out of
different points of Malala’s life. In
one scene we find out about the
campaigning Malala did in her
native Swat Valley; in the next we
see her in Kenya, asking schoolgirls
about what they want to do when
they’re older; in another she’s
interviewed about why she can’t
have a boyfriend. Unfortunately,
this means that the film lacks an
overall narrative structure, inching
slowly forward towards the Nobel
Prize announcement, which is only
revealed over the credits.
The film does well to flesh out the
Malala narrative, which – without
caution – could easily go down as
just another heart-warming story of
good triumphing over evil. We see
the very real effects that the attack
has had on her life; not only the
fact that she can’t hear in one ear, or
move one side of her face properly,
but also her life-long struggle for
a normality that has eschewed

her since a young age. Similarly, it
highlights the fact that this denial of
education is not a one-off situation,
but instead one that happens to
children all over the world. One
memorable sequence takes place on
the Jordan-Syria border, and serves
to remind us of the human factors
involved when we pontificate about
refugee asylum. It is at points like
this the film is at its most real.
A pity then that most of the film
eschews such realism, with Malala
providing the voiceover to mawkish
animation, or reconstructed
sequences. Cinéma vérité it is not
– a sentiment that is only enforced
by the end credits, which urge us to
visit the Malala Foundation website,
and use the hashtag #withmalala.
Such aspects only support the idea
that we are, in essence, watching a
90 minute advert for an education
charity. Brand-charity synergy may
be laudable, but it does not make a
great documentary.
