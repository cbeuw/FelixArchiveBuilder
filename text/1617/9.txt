Imperial’s André Neveswins mathematics award at star studded Breakthrough Prizes
I
mperial College’s very own
André Arroja Neves has
won the New Horizons in
Mathematics Award at the
Breakthrough Prizes, which was
held at the NASA Ames Research
Centre in Silicon Valley on
November 9th. The professor in the
Department of Pure Mathematics
won the prize, along with Codá
Marques, for having solved the 50-
year old Willmore Conjecture in
2012.
The Breakthrough Awards, now
in their third year, are sponsored
by some of society’s modern
powerhouse tech giants, who have
all made significant breakthroughs
of their own. This includes the co-
founder and CEO of 23andMe,
Anne Wojcicki, and her now ex-
husband, the Google co-founder
Sergey Chin – in addition to
DST founder Yuri Milner and his
wife Julia, Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla
Chan, and AliBaba founder Jack
Ma and his wife Cathy Zhang.
The committee handed out $21.9
million in prizes for significant
achievements and innovations in
three categories: Fundamental
Physics, Life Sciences, and
Mathematics. Each category
also has a sub-category called
New Horizons, handed to junior
researchers like Prof. Neves who
are ahead of the game in producing
important work in their field.
The awards were hosted by Seth
MacFarlane, the well-known
creator of Family Guy. A star-
studded Hollywood line-up gave
away the prizes and performed,
including Pharrell Williams,
Russell Crowe, Hilary Swank,
and Lily Collins. Winners ranged
from a 1300 scientist-deep team
studying neutrinos (including team
leaders who won the Nobel Prize
in Physics for this research), to an
MIT professor who developed the
field of optogenetics – using light
signals to treat Parkinson’s and
other neurological disorders.
The prize money is intended to
provide funding for research that is
proving to be successful. “Science is
racing forward to meet the demands
oftheworld’smostcriticalissues,and
we have a duty to support it”, says
Jack Ma. However, using celebrity
power and live broadcasting on
Fox News, the award ceremony
also shines a spotlight on the grand
achievements of scientists, for
What can science policy do for you?

n a university populated by
scientists, it can be very easy to
lose sight of the world outside.
Of course,science is important
– we know that; we are studying it.
But how many people outside of
the science bubble really appreciate
what science is telling us, and what
it can say on some of the big issues
that influence our lives?
Politicians are a key group
outside the science world that it is
important for us to engage with.
Scientists could, and in some cases
do, know how to feed, house and
clothe the world – and how to
stop it from imploding - but if this
information never gets to policy
makers, very little can be done to

A call to arms from the LSFP. Shape science policy, shape the world
ensure that science has an impact
on people’s lives.
A major issue is that the written
world of science is difficult for non-
scientists to engage in. There are
hundreds of peer-reviewed journals,
all containing copious amounts of
highly technical information, coded
in highly technical language. This
can be challenging enough even for
people with a background in science,
and is hugely off-putting for non-
scientists. Where should they start
reading? Who do they trust when
there is a conflict of evidence? How
applicable is this knowledge?
To ensure politicians can
understand the fields of science
relevant to their work, policy
briefings are written. The most
well know of these are POST

people who would otherwise never
hear about them. This research is
fundamentally altering the way we
see and interact with the world, but
is often considered boring, stuffy, or
impossible to understand.Casting it
in this ‘sizzling’ and dynamic light
attracts attention, funding, and
respect.
Adorning research with
Hollywood sparkle also encourages
a generation of young people to
look to STEM for an exciting,
illustrious, and potentially world-
changing career. To this end, there
is a Breakthrough Junior Challenge
Award for high school students,this
year won by a student from Ohio for
a dynamic video on understanding
special relativity.
As the Breakthrough Prize website
notes, “Great scientists enrich us
all. They enable technologies that
ease our lives, but they also show us
what’s beyond our horizons.” Will
you be the next Imperial College
scientist to win the Breakthrough
Prize and show us what’s over the
next horizon? Prof. Neves’ win has
certainly shown us that it’s more
than possible.

(POST), and are dense summaries
of a field (such as‘Precision Farming’
or ‘Trends in Energy’), noting
where evidence is more certain,
where conflicts lie, and where the
field is currently developing. Whilst
these are supposedly neutral in
content, as they are produced by the
government, other briefings can be
much more targeted.
Science-focused think tanks
and lobby groups also summarise
evidence from the literature,but they
use it to make suggestions for future
policy choices. The papers produced
by these institutes are presented
to policy makers, and become part
of the body of knowledge they
use to make decisions. One such
thinktank is based here at Imperial
– the student-run London Forum
for Science and Policy, which
anyone can get involved with. They
have already published a number
of papers, and even presented at
Brussels.
Interested in getting involved
with a thinktank, or want to learn
more? Come along to the launch
of LFSP’s most recent paper,
Improving the Visibility of Women
in STEM, at 6.30pm today in the
Pippard Lecture Theatre, or like
LFSP on Facebook. We are looking
for enthusiastic people to get
involved in writing policy papers,
so if you are interested in what you
have just read, get in touch!
C
ancer is one of the
scourges of humanity.
Two trillion cell
divisions take place in
the average human body every
day. Every time a cell divides,
roughly three billion genetic base
pairs distributed throughout 23
chromosomes need to be copied,
and sometimes our bodies get it
wrong.Usually,these poor copies are
automatically destroyed by the body,
but from time to time, a mutated
cell slips through and continues to
divide. If this goes unchecked, a
benign tumour may form. If that
tumour begins to spread to other
tissues, it is known as malignant,
and this is cancer.
While scientists have developed
treatments for various cancers,
mortality rates still remain high, at
around one in five. Because cancer
is caused by abnormal cell division,
the more cells a person has, the
more likely they are to get cancer.
Taller people, for example, are at
higher risk than shorter people.
So what about huge animals,
like whales? Animals get cancer in
much the same way humans do, and

Conservation in aid of cancer research
Cutting corners in conservation may cost us the cure
whales are no exception. However,
cancer in whales very rarely spreads.
At the other end of the spectrum,
tiny animals with short life spans,
like mice, are cancer prone.
This lack of correlation is called
Peto’s paradox. Larger animals
seem to have evolved mechanisms
for effectively combating cancer;
essential to ensuring their survival.
Consequently, whales may hold
a key to learning how to beat
cancer. Researchers are looking at
this seriously. But, as many aspects
of nature, one unlikely animal so
spectacularly violates Peto’s paradox
that a cure for cancer may be held in
its genetics.
The naked mole rat is sufficiently
ugly to be featured in The Ugly
Animals: We can’t all be Pandas by
Simon Watt, published by the
Ugly Animal Preservation Society.
But the naked mole rat is far more
than meets the eye. One mole rat
can live for up to 30 years without
ever getting cancer. A 2013 study
in Nature found that naked mole
rats produce a gloopy, sugar-rich
substance called hyaluronan. This
forms a kind of seal around cells,
preventing the runaway cell division
that causes cancer. The same
chemical is produced by humans,
but not in high quantities, and the
naked mole rat’s version is also a
longer chained form.
Hyaluronan is already used as a
cancer treatment. Researchers are
now looking to use the naked mole
rat’s version to find out if it is more
effective. They may find that it is
ineffective: that it fails to have the
same effect in humans as it does in
the naked mole rat. Many clinical
tests that are effective in animal
test subjects fail to have any effect
in humans, due to differences in our
genetics. However, there’s a chance
that it could substantially improve
survival rates of cancer in humans,
especially when combined with
other, more widespread treatments.
Unfortunately for species like
the mole rat, some scientists have
posited that the earth is on the brink
of a sixth mass extinction event.
Climate change, loss of habitat, and
various other factors have made
conservation ever more challenging
and ever-more crucial. This week,
UN officials have announced that
plans to tackle climate change
are not enough to keep the global
temperature increase below the 2o
C
danger threshold. Later this month,
UN nations will meet in Paris to
discuss plans to tackle climate
change.
The effects of climate change
and habitat loss are showing
already in the UK. Four UK bird
species, including the puffin, are
now at serious risk of extinction.
Eight British species are on
the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature’s Red List
of threatened species, and a further
14 species considered to be ‘near-
threatened’.
Why does this matter?
For Simon Watt at the Ugly
Animal Preservation Society, the
‘pretty’ animals like pandas get all
the attention, and all the money.
H
ow many species do
you think exist on
planet earth? 100
thousand, one million,
ten million? Recent estimations
have induced a species count of
8.7 million. More than 1000 years
would be needed to catalogue such
a vast number. It’s really a question
of ‘where do we start?’
From the depths of the icy
Antarctic waters, this answer is
literally being called out to us.
Recently tuning in to ‘What’s going
on in the Antarctic’, astonishment
circulated with the identification
of a unique whale song and with it,
perhaps a new species. But how can
we not have already catalogued all
whale species? Let’s face it; they’re
not exactly small!
The mysterious Antarctic habitant
is thought to be from the family
Ziphiidea, otherwise known as
‘Deraniyagala’s Beaked Whales’.
They are renowned for their shyness
and thus a poorly-known animal
group. Deraniyagala’s beaked whale
was identified as a new species only
last year, bringing the total number
of species in the beaked whale
group to 22. Diving out of the sight
of any on-looking scientists, it is
suspected that the Ziphiidea family
harbours more unknown relations
to Deraniyagala.
We bias our conservation towards
pandas, tigers and elephants, while
the naked mole rat, blobfish and
assorted other ugly animals are
neglected.
Some of these animals, like
the naked mole rat, could hold
importantsecrets.Bylettingthemgo
extinct, we could be losing valuable,
irrecoverable information. While
the naked mole rat’s population is
healthy, it’s clear that we need to
work to be indiscriminate in our
efforts to conserve life on earth.One
day, we may find ourselves indebted
to the naked mole rat.

Lonely wail might indicate new species
Yet, echolocation of this new
species is difficult. The unique
signal, named BW29, has been
recorded fourteen times on separate
occasions. Tracking down the
anonymous composer is proving to
be problematic. Timing and sound
types separate the signal from others
known. Suspicions lie with the
strap-toothed southern bottlenose
species, however, sightings of this
species are rare south of latitudes
60o
S in the Southern Ocean, giving
the strap-tooth a strong alibi.
Another suspect is the Gray’s
beaked whale, commonly sighted
in the region. However, frequency
of the latter species’ calls differs
from the BW29 signal frequency,
removing the Gray beaked
species as a culprit. Adding to the
confusion, another unique call,
dubbed Antarctic BW37 has also
been recorded, a higher frequency
than the first, but these two unique
calls could actually belong to the
same species. However, given the
ocean covers 70% of our planet, it
would be surprising if these signals
didn’t belong to two new species.
