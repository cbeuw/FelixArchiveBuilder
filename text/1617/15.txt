Classic charm abounds at new RA show
Jean Etienne Liotard’s work is a sight for sore eyes in a world filled with abstract art
Julia Zhuang

W
ho, you may ask,
is Jean-Etienne
Liotard? An
eccentric fellow in
his oriental attire, elongated fingers
reach out to something behind
the curtain. His eyes wrinkled
from laughter, mouth wide open,
revealing a missing tooth.This is my
first impression of him.As I glanced
at those 18th
century aristocratic
elites arrayed on the walls of Royal
Academy, Liotard’s self-portrait,
laughing, still managed to impress.
Born in Geneva and trained in
Paris, Liotard was one of the most
accomplished portraitists of the
Enlightenment era. He earned a
reputation for his meticulous pastel
portraits, and was commissioned in
royal courts across Europe. Styled
himself in an exotic manner,Liotard
‘the Turk’ fuelled the fashion for
turquerie, or Orientalism, that
indulged the European society. Yet
nowadays his name only evokes
unfamiliarity.
“Truth prevailed in all Liotard’s
works,” marked an art historian.
Indeed, gazing down at me with
her imposing look, the Countess of
Guildford is a perfect illustration of
verisimilitude.She is garnished with
gleaming velvet and lace, diamond
on her neck sparkles from a distance.
But is she flattered by the ruthless
depiction of her double chin? I don’t
know; I am amused.
There is candour in Liotard’s
seemingly extravagant paintings,
but it did not set him apart from
Rembrandt or Durer.In my opinion,
Liotard’s speciality lied elsewhere –
he caught fleeting moments with
tender, sympathetic eyes. After
being snared onto vellum for two-
and-a-half centuries, his sitters
are still alive with pastel warmth.
Among them all, the portrait of
Suzanne Curchod is my favourite.
Seated by a lavishing array of fruit
and glassware, she looks up as if
interrupted in her reading, eyes
flickering with delight. And what
a dress she is wearing! Opaque,
radiant blue heightened with
gouache; intricate, transparent silk
embroidered on her sleeves.
In the next room, hanging next to
each other are the double portraits of
Julie and Issac-Louis de Thellusson.
The newly-weds stare admiringly
into each other, faces illuminating
with joy. Beside them, the frail
painting of Princess Louisa-Anne
gazes at me with anxious, curious
eyes – a little girl dwarfed by an
oversized dress. Liotard painted
her hair so soft that it begs to be
combed.Very few artists can capture
such heartbreaking tenderness, and
he succeeded with a humane touch
rarely found in royal portraitures.
His characters are not social ciphers;

meet everyday.
Why have such works disappeared
from public attention? This is a
question easy to ask, but tricky
to answer. Unlike the man
himself, Liotard’s works do not
make a proclamation. They were
commissioned as private collections,
treasured by their owners without
making a public appearance. His
choice of medium, the versatile
pastel, gave these paintings vivacity
and luminosity, but also made
them extremely fragile and almost
impossible to transport.
Moreover, art is often evaluated
according to contemporary taste.
In a world filled with abstract and
controversial art, Liotard’s calm
contentment may be too subtle
to be fully appreciated. Yet there’s
charm in every portrait – they will
put up a smile on your face.

A
ll the world’s a stage. If
only it was one decked
out by the NT’s set
designers for their
production of ‘As You Like It’.
Directed by Polly Findlay, this
latest performance of Shakespearian
comedy gives us a handful of gags,
awe-inspiring stagecraft and a
soundscape that eclipses both –
but all at the expense of examining
Rosalind and our own gender
zeitgeist.
We walk in to a colour-charged
trading floor and an already bustling
cast throwing up some definite Star
Trek vibes.Rosalie Craig as Rosalind
surveys her uniformed office drones,
for a second suggesting that she may
live up to the role as Shakespeare’s
most-developed female lead (albeit
one that spends half of the play
dressed as a man). This space(ship)

Style over substance in As You Like It
Jenny Lea

The National Theatre throws the heft of its big budget behind Shakespeare’s classic
is it an unwritten rule that in all
Shakespeare they must attempt as
many regional dialects as possible?!
In many past performances and
now. we see a Scot, a Welshman and
a hybrid of the two, just to make
the 16th
Century verse a little more
difficult. This was all accompanied
by Touchstone’s adoption of a
somewhat Geordie accent. I wonder
if Old William was thinking of his
likeness to a particular Hairy Biker
when writing the play…

There must be a word for the
score; a choir nestled in furniture
wilderness provide backing for Fra
Fre’s magnificent earthy vocals (and
jawline). As well as the occasional
owl noise and rain shower, to revert
once more to my theme of being
more enamoured by the actors’
set than their speeches, the close
harmonies were exquisitely judged
and at times could have formed a
piece in itself.
One thing that I have noticed:
Awe-inspiring
stagecraft
at the
expense of
Rosalind
Overall however, a pleasurable
production. A slapstick and self-
aware nature avoids the cringe factor
that is all too often served with the
modernization of a classic tale, but
in turn simply not enough was done
for the audience to leave the theatre
with “But heavenly Rosalind!”
resonating in their minds.

set transitions of all time, as bonsai
trees fall to the floor and darkness
transports us into a forest of
dangling desks.
Unfortunately, the magical
mysteryofthesurroundingsdoesnot
bleed into the dynamics of the two
main characters. Rosalind is quickly
reduced to giddiness by Orlando’s
love, whilst he rarely hints at her
cross-dressing and continues to woo
via the age-old correspondence of
post-it notes. A seemingly bizarre
occurrence considering the text’s
reliance on homosexuality being
inherently ‘funny’ for comedy.
Kieran Hodgson doping his way to the top
I
n 2003 a young, frail lad from
West Yorkshire had only
one idol – the great Lance
Armstrong. Inspired by the
serene, omnipotent cyclist come
lying bastard, Kieran Hodgson is
taking the world by storm with his
completely honest, unadulterated,
dope-free journey. Fun and easy-
going, Hodgson’s set is smooth
and simple, effortlessly offering
his joyous accounts of cycling’s
favourite bad guy.
The talk of the town since
his lauded performance at the
Max Falkenberg
Arts Editor
Edinburgh Fringe, Hodgson is
the latest young comedian on the
road to hitting it big. His brand of
comedy isn’t wildly smart and his
impressions aren’t hugely refined,
but he offers a laid back,engaging set
which is wonderfully easy watching.
Oddly for a northerner, he sounds
as southern as you can get, but
that doesn’t hold back the endless
quips on his homeland. Throwing
in musical numbers and a cracking
cameo from Opera, Hodgson has
an eye for picking out the audience’s
memorable Armstrong moments
and he plays on it with ease, but not
everyone is quite so tuned in.
It is funny how a figure like
Armstrong has such a comic
appeal – the jokes seem endless
and continually hilarious. The
aspirations of a young mountain
biker and his uninspired stray into
Not quite Armstrong’s physique but almost...
the world of rowing only leads
back to a greater, more wonderful
reminder of Armstrong’s honest
ways. A moral tale Hodgson’s
evening is not, but through all the
satire it’s not too hard finding one.
Yet, to use a term I never thought
I would, Hodgson is missing his
X-factor.
Although I had great fun, I get
the feeling that Hodgson’s show just
won’t satisfy our generation.Despite
having grown up with an awareness
of Armstrong, his story and his
actions seem to mean more to
people in their late twenties than to
us.A rubbish reason,I know,but the
result is that for me Hodgson never
hits the heights I was promised.
