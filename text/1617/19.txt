The Union is currently preparing for the Summer Ball 2016 and we need your
help to choose a theme. Last year, we were shaken not stirred by our Bond
themed ball. In previous years we’ve been down the rabbit hole with an Alice
in Wonderland theme, and entered the Prohibition era.
We listened to what you had to say about the ball in our feedback survey last
year and picked the following six themes from your feedback. Let us know
what you would prefer out of:
A Superheroes A 1960s/Flower Power
A Greek Gods and Goddesses A Cabaret/Casino/Vegas
A Rio Carnival A Hollywood
Vote for your theme at:

Choose the theme for next year’s Summer Ball!
Volunteer with Community Connections!
Community Connections is our volunteering service
linking Imperial students with the local community through
volunteering. Whatever you study or the year you are in,
whether you’re an undergraduate or postgraduate, if you
have a couple of days to spare each month or just a few
hours, if you want to volunteer by yourself or participate in
a mass volunteer event, there’s a volunteering opportunity
to suit everyone’s interests and timetables.
If you’re interested in volunteering in the community, find
out what’s on offer at:
