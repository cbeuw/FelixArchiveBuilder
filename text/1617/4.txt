Labour HQ moving to High Street Kensington
I
n the most exciting
development in High
Street Kensington since the
Odeon was shut down, this
week it was announced that the
Labour headquarters would be
uprooting from its current offices
in Westminster and relocating to
within walking distance of Imperial
College London.
This comes as a consequence,
not of Jeremy Corbyn having a
hankering for wasabi flavoured
crisps from Whole Foods, but since
the Labour party failed to find an
affordable HQ near Westminster
before Christmas.

New observatory keeps any eye on big data
L
ast week,the KPMG Data
Observatory was launched
as part of Imperial’s Data
Science Institute. The
purpose of the observatory is to
enable the analysis and visualisation
of data, particularly useful for large
corporations that collect massive
amounts of it.
This new observatory,which is part
of the £20m funding provided by
the professional services company,
will make it easier for businesses
to spot new patterns and emerging
trends with greater clarity. The
observatory consists of a massive
130 million pixel screen, powered
by 32 computers and 313 degrees of
surround sound.
Bringing scientists and business
people together, this piece of kit
is a big opportunity for college to
further enhance its already strong
ties with various corporations. It’s
also a coup for the business school.
Imperial scientists will use the
observatory to visualise data about
the solar system and climate change.
Mark Kennedy,Director of Imperial
Business Analytics, argues that the
main function of the observatory is
to “take advantage of years and years
of evolution,” and make use of the
fact that “humans are really good at
recognising patterns visually”.
For example, banks will be able
to decide where to open new
branches to enhance profits based
on a visualisation of data trends that
would ultimately pin point where
the best location for a new branch
would be. Mr Kennedy further
added that “the more we can turn
data into something visual, the
more people can actually respond
to what’s going on in the world,

KPMG are sponsoring a big data suite that will visualise data for
businesses, scientists and students
and take decisions that move
organisations forward”.
One of the goals of the project
is to provide a pilot for new data
observatories where staff and
students can interact and work with
big data.
“We are still very much in the
silent movie-era of big data”, said
KPMG’s head of analytics, Alwin
Magimay, who added, that “by
finding better ways of visualising
and analysing their data, companies
will be able to unlock profitability”.

Corbyn’s team will be fighting inequality from Kensington and Chelsea
offices to political parties since to
the attack on the Conservative
Headquarters in 2010 during the
student protests over the increase in
tuition fees.
The move is set to occur before
Christmas, meaning the party’s
members will be forced to travel
three miles in order to reach
Whitehall and the Houses of
Parliament, instead of their current
location in Brewer’s Green in
Westminster, which is walking
distance away. As well as now being
metres away from Corbyn’s most
outspoken objectors, the Daily
Mail, the Labour headquarters will
be extremely near the residences
of several Conservative peers, the
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge,
and of course, Metric.
This move will not affect Jeremy
Corbyn’s core team, however, as
they shall remain in and around
Westminster,including Sadiq Khan,
Labour’s Candidate for the London
mayoral contest and Labour deputy,
Tom Watson.
An insider has reported to the
Financial Times that the move to
fancy High Street Kensington is
merely a “shell”building, and is only
temporary until offices are found
closer to Parliament.
