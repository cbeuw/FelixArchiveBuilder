College fees likely to rise under new plans
L
ast Friday, the government
released its ‘green paper’
on higher education.
Promising to put
students “at the heart of higher
education”,the105pagedocument
proposes huge changes to fees and
the way universities are created.
The fees for home students
at the moment are capped at
£9000 per year, after being hiked
from £3375, in 2012. The green
paper recommends that the best
institutions should have uncapped
fees, allowing them to increase
with inflation. This would allow
institutions like Imperial to bump
up their prices.
The paper also proposes making
universities exempt from Freedom
of Information requests, that
allow anyone to inquire as to how

Chancellor introduces spending review from Imperial
A
fter tagging along on
President Xi’s visit
three weeks ago, George
Osborne was back at
Imperial on Monday, but this time
slightly further out at our White
City branch, AKA Imperial West.
Speaking from the unfinished
campus, which overlooks the A40,
the chancellor introduced the
spending review.
Ahead of its publication on the
26th
of November, he dropped
some major hints as to the review’s
contents. He spoke about about
security, both financial and national,
reminding the assembled gaggle of
journalists that despite the internet
being “central to modern life”,
its existence and use by terrorists
justified the need for an increase in
the number of spies the government
employs.
He also mentioned that four
government departments –
transport, food and rural affairs,
local government and the treasury –
will have their spending cut by 30%
by the end of this parliament.
Health and international aid
budgets will be protected. Spending
on the elderly and the NHS will
make up 44% of the national budget,
in plans the chief of NHS England
has called “unworkable”.
David Cameron was
simultaneously speaking at the
Confederation of British Industries
conferences, where he too reiterated
the party line, that the focus is on
putting “the security of British
families first”. He was heckled by
activists halfway through, and went
full teacher mode, pleading with
them: “Come on – come on guys, if
you sit down now you can ask me a
Grace Rahman
Editor-in-Chief
question”. George suffered no such
interruptions at Imperial, especially
since FELIX wasn’t invited.
Imperial proudly lauded the visit
on its news website,quoting George
as saying he “deliberately chose to
come here today, to this science
campus, to talk about economics”.
At a time when students across the
country, including at Imperial, are
complaining about their treatment
as sources of income rather than
young minds to be taught, the
chancellor’s comments talking
about “world-beating science and
innovation, turned into commercial
application” somewhat clashed with
the setting.

political sight, the press release
went on to quote Osborne as saying
Imperial “represents the future of
our economy here in the UK”.
Considering the spending review
has put huge emphasis on spending
for older generations, it seemed
ironic to hold the press conference
at a university. As the ex-Tory
minister of universities put it, the
review “raises questions about the
future role of the state in boosting
productivity and supporting young
adults”.
the publicly funded institution is
run. If data that can answer their
question has been recorded, the
institution has to respond. The
opposition party have dismissed
the policy as a way of preventing
the public from seeing how the
government spends public funds,
whereas the green paper says
eliminating universities from FOI
legislation will save them £10m
a year and put them on equal
footing with private companies in
the industry, who do not have to
answer such requests.
The paper also proposes a new
‘Office for Students’, which...
