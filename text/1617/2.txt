Y
ou couldn’t make it
up, this week. George
Osborne, everybody’s
favourite tax-credit-for-
the-disabled-cutting, pro-taxing-
tampons chancellor of the exchequer
was back at Imperial. Hoorah!
He was here to promote the latest
spending review. After spouting
some shpiel about the NHS and that
we need to hire more spies because,
like, the internet exists, George-O
went on to say that Imperial “doesn’t
just represent the future of science
in the world, it represents the future
of the economy here in the UK”.
First of all, congrats to us. We all
attend the university that represents
‘future science in the world’, a
soundbite so muddled it could be a
dodgy pitch on The Apprentice.
As much as it pains me to say,
Imperial could end up looking a
little like the economy quite soon.
This week we’ve seen the release
of a new green paper on higher
education, setting out what will
probably become law within this
parliament. If everything in the
paper does happen, which is pretty
likely, we’d see the top universities,
doing STEM subjects (two ticks
for us, then) being allowed to
significantly bump up fees.

The paper’s already been damned
by unions, academics and students
across the country for treating
students as consumers.
The biggest threat here is
attaching a commercial price
to quality of teaching. Only the
wealthiest can afford the best
education, or aren’t frightened off
by the doom of huge loans. Do
we want the best universities to be
even more socially exclusive? The
government’s only just realised that
ethnic names on UCAS forms are
subject to unconscious negative
bias during the selection process,
and now they’re trying to make it
harder for the poorest to get the best
education.
We’ve got a pretty rage-y
comment piece about ghettoisation
of halls this week, but it’s much
the same story as this one. If you
charge for the good stuff, all the
rich people will end up in one place,
and the poor in another. This is an
established model for business, but
should publicly funded universities
be adopting it too?
It all comes down to the question
of whether students should
be treated as consumers: their
employability like the interest rate,
UCAS points your credit score and
an education the big old payday loan
you’re getting.
Please write in if you go to the
business school and that metaphor
is so factually incorrect, it upset
you. Write in if you liked it, because
it’s mid-term, and everybody likes
compliments.
If anything here riles you, makes
you angry, or better, makes you
want to put pen to paper or stylus
to tablet, let me know, and we’ll
probably flipping publish you. It’s
like having a blog, except people
besides your mates might read it. Or
that’s what I tell myself.

...would replace the Higher
Education Funding Council
that distributes public funds
to universities. This new body
would also be in charge of
ranking institutions based on
student satisfaction, teaching,
and something the green paper
puts particular emphasis on:
employability.
A ‘green paper’ is the
government’s way of reviewing
legislation before it becomes law.
At the moment, the Department
forBusiness,InnovationandSkills,
that manages higher education,
is asking for feedback on the
paper. Professors from Warwick,
Newcastle and UCL, amongst
others, have signed an open
letter, published in the Guardian,
condemning the proposals. The
group of professors are worried
that this legislation would allow
“market forces [to] permeate”
the sector. They also dispute the
relaxation of rules for private
sector companies becoming
universities. Comparing the new
strategy to the model that “caused
the financial crash”, they also
report dismay at the green paper’s
emphasis on what employers
want, rather than the opinions
of those working within higher
education institutions. Indeed, the
NUS reports that ‘what employers
want’ is mentioned in the paper
35 times, as opposed to ‘what
students want’, which is brought
up 23 times.
The National Union of Students,
who are affiliated with student
unions across the country, but
not Imperial’s, say the paper is
unfortunate in that it only focuses
on “entry and exit to the system”.
The NUS closed a press release
on the paper saying, “this is the
university hunger games and the
ones losing out are students and
academics.”
The paper touches on the future
of student unions, saying they will
be subject to trade union reforms
that will “improve union practices
and increasy transparency”. The
open letter in the Guardian
expressed fear that these changes
will risk unions’“autonomy”.

Government unveils university funding changes
Deputy President (Welfare), said,
“Even at this early stage I am
extremely concerned about the
impact the proposals will have on
students, fees and the future of
higher education.”
AnImperialcollegespokesperson
said, “The College is considering
the Green Paper carefully and
will respond to the consultation,”
adding that, “the independence
• Universities would be allowed
to raise fees with inflation
• Easier for institutions to get
university status
• Plans have been called “Trojan
horse for raising fees”
of universities should be fully
recognised by the Government as
it develops these proposals, and
decisions on the future allocation
of funding to universities should
remain independent of Ministers
and Government departments.
We look forward to discussing the
key issues with Imperial College
Union, and to sharing our draft
response with them.”
