F
rom the guy who probably
invented vaporwave comes
in even more weird shit.
Experimental American
musician, Daniel Lopatin (more
commonly known as Oneohtrix
Point Never) ruptures the walls of
reality with his new record, Garden
of Delete.
Oneohtrix Point Never records
have always managed to sound
like expertly arranged collections
of experiments rather than linear,
narrative driven albums. Like his
previous work, they are full of
alien sounds, but this time they’re
combined to form something that
feels a lot more whole.
From the grungy depths of ‘Sdfk’
to the anthemic heights of ‘I Bit
Through It,’Garden of Delete takes us
on a journey through an otherwordly
landscape that few musicians are
capable of constructing.
I’ve spent the last week almost
exclusively listened to the record;
each listen allows me, for short
moment, to escape the reality of
everyday life. It has guided me
through the streets at night as I walk
through dark, isolated pathways and
it has kept me awake on late, lonely
bus rides home. It is far more than
a companion. From the beeping
of closing tube doors to midnight
conversations in McDonalds, the

album perfectly blends in with
the sounds of travel and the bustle
of the inner city. It is cinematic
on a personal level, making every
moment feel like the prelude to an
ominous threat.
While it is by far Lopatin’s most
welcoming collection of songs,
there is still a lot of experimentation
across the twelve tracks that make
up the record. While it may not
have been his intention, the themes
of deletion and negative space are
essential to much of the appeal of
Garden of Delete.
At the beginning of ‘Ezra’ it
sounds like the artist has selected
parts of the track and pressed delete
on a keyboard;it is in these moments
of silence that he evokes far more
emotion than many artists can in
three entire minutes. Time stops
and then starts back up again, like a
nightmarish, glitched rollercoaster.
There is much about Garden of
Delete to fear; the gargles, asthmatic
whimpers, and high-pitched
squeams of its vocal samples quickly
become rival voices in your head.
Sometimes you can hear words
among these warped growls, and
amusingly, Lopatin has released a
set of lyric sheets for the album.
As always, Lopatin creates an
electric range of synthesiser sounds.
There are the usual hard-hitting
crashes and some are grainy and
uncomfortable to listen to. These
are matched by the dulcet tones of
strings, which at times sound like
weird imitations of Arca.There’s one Lopatin uses the iTunes visualiser to advertise his new music. Photo Credit: Warp
synth on the album shimmering; if
we could hear the sun shining, this
is would what it would sound like.
‘Mutant Standard’, an eight
minute epic, stands out as the most
cinematic piece on the record. It
starts off like a thumping, violent
heartbeat and evolves into a richly
layered anthem.
To fully appreciate Oneohtrix
Point Never’s latest work, listen to it
in the darkest corner of the darkest
alleyway in the worst part of town.
Lose all illusion of safety and allow
it to guide you through through the
night. By the time you arrive at your
destination, the music is over, but
your mind and body are ready.

Grimes’ radiant Art Angels
W
ith Visions, Grimes
(the stage name of
Claire Boucher)
gave us an album
that combined the danceable sound
of synthpop with introspection
and the sorrow of dark-wave.
As one of the defining albums
of 2012, it was celebrated and
adored by many, including myself.
Upon first hearing ‘REALiTi’(the
original version), I felt confident
that Boucher would deliver another
sonically impressive album, distinct
and radical when compared to her
contemporaries. This feeling soon
began to fade with the release of her
new singles, ‘Flesh without Blood’
and ‘Life in the Vivid Dream’,
the first we would hear from the
record. I was ready to let my own
expectations inhibit my ability to
form a fair opinion of Art Angels,
but after seeing how they fit into
her new work, it’s obvious that
Grimes hasn’t completely left her
old sound behind. Her music is now
more guitar-driven and borders
on bubblegum pop – somehow it
works. Art Angels is full of bangers
(and I say that un-ironically).

me, I’ll be back on the shelf.” She
comments on the disparity between
the image she’d like to present
and the one actually presented by
the media. Don’t worry, Grimes,
here at FELIX we’ll always love
you. The drawn out “California”
in the chorus turns the song into
one of the year’s biggest anthems.
Grimes crushes it on the unhinged
‘Kill V. Maim’, a song “written from
the perspective of Al Pacino in
The Godfather Pt 2. Except he’s a
vampire who can switch gender and
travel through space.” It’s one of
the many songs from the album that
forces your body to wiggle and jerk
in ways Drake would be proud of.
Janelle Monae’s guest vocals on
‘Venus Fly’ turn it into strange
futuristic pop. It lures you in
with a trap-like beat and then
surprises you with a beautiful
violin solo. It’s easily the most
experimental track on the album.
Like an angel from heaven, Art
Angels,glows with a radiance.It stays
within the confines of pop music but
is able to transcend the tired tropes
of the pop industrial complex.
While it might not be as coherent
as previous albums, the songs stand
on their own. They are notably
catchy, uplifting, and accessible.

fortnightly review
of music by Imperial students. This
section can only exist if we continue
to receive submissions. So, please
keep the demos coming. Send them
to the email on the right or via post
(if you still use archaic forms of
communication); we’d love to start
getting cassettes or CDs to review.
FELIX will say lots of nice things
about your music if you do.

made-up mythical creatures.
Their lyrics often read like
beautiful poetry. They’re funny with
the black humour of ‘Dead Souls’:
“He’ll buy up your dead, and you’ll
be tax exempt / Then he’ll mortgage
the lot to the state.” Or, they’re sad
and harrowing like in ‘Woman of
the Sea’where the narrator describes
herself drowning: “And I go to sleep
a woman of the sea… Because the
sea forever shares a bed with me.”
On the live recording of ‘Woman
of the Sea’, Michael Ridley, a
Physics PhD student, asks his
crowd to make the sounds of sea
animals; it’s both hilarious and
charming. This is a band best suited
for the corner of an artisan coffee
shop or a trendy microbrewery pub.
Others in the FELIX office were
less impressed. An anonymous Arts
Editor described the demos as:
“Impressive lyrics marred by poor
vocals and an abysmal sound check.
Unimpressive, amateur guitar riffs
with a disappointing end result. It’s
shit and pretty wanky.I don’t like it.”
Ouch. Harsh words from a harsh
editor.
