Your internet history is up for grabs
S
ince Edward Snowden’s
leaks in 2013, many have
compared the British state
to The Party from George
Orwell’s prophetic Nineteen Eighty-
Four. The Party seeks power; not
to improve the lives of others,
but entirely for its own interests.
From the transceiving television
sets used to monitor the citizens’
thoughtcrime (the act of socially
unacceptable thoughts), there are
many areas where Orwell’s fiction
now overlaps with the reality of 21st
century Britain.
With the introduction of the
Investigatory Powers Bill, Theresa
May aspires to become much more
than Big Brother, and as a result our
future has the potential to be far
worse than Orwell’s dystopian novel
ever predicted.
The extent to which we have
submitted ourselves to the internet
has left us exposed. If this bill
succeeds, security forces will be
given new powers to examine our
digital footprint from the last twelve
months. It will enshrine in law the
bulk collection of personal metadata,
the hacking into and bugging of
computers,and will force companies
to assist in bypassing encryption.
Any curiosity or “extremist”
intrigue could be used against
us without our knowledge and
a simple spelling mistake when
entering a URL could now make
you look suspect. By only keeping
your history up to the first forward
slash of each website address,
security forces lose the context of
why someone is visiting a specific
site. It could be entirely innocent.
The people of Britain seem all
too eager to sacrifice their right
to privacy in order to protect
themselves from the supposed
threat of terrorism. Andrew Parker,
the chief of MI5, has been vocal in
the need for more powers to assist
in fight against those who oppose
our “great” nation, claiming that
we are now facing the most serious
threat of a terrorist attack since
9/11. Mention ISIS and al-Qaeda
enough times and you can make
the public believe anything. For the
establishment, fear has always been
their most powerful tool.
It would be naive to believe that
these powers would be only used
probably get a warrant for the
Queen’s browsing history.
Personally, I think that the
Conservative Party is a serious
threat to our national security,
our economic security and your
family’s security. I could probably
even find evidence to support this,
but that doesn’t mean I should be
allowed unbounded access to their
personal data. While this argument
might be reductive, it illustrates that
threats are often entirely subjective,
especially to those trying to cling to
power.
As well as the far right, it’s often
the “extreme” left that are most
vulnerable to surveillance.
In the nineties, police conducted
spying operations on a number
of Labour politicians. They
examined their political beliefs, the
demonstrations they attended, and
the people they met with.
While the new bill places
restrictions on the surveillance of
MPs (the Prime Minister must be
consulted in all cases),it could easily
be used to undermine activists and
anyone the establishment disagrees
with. So, it’s not ridiculous to think
that these powers could one day be
used by a ruling party to quell the
opposition.
Obviously,if you’ve got nothing to
hide, you’ve got nothing to fear. It’s
only metadata that the government
is asking for, right?
We’ve probably all looked at some
kinky shit online that we’d rather
not let other people know about. If
you’re going to use that line, I look

You should be more worried about Theresa May’s new Investigatory Powers bill
Mention ISIS
or al-Qaeda

and you can
make the
public believe
anything
forward to the moment when an
entire year’s worth of your browsing
history is dumped on the internet;
because all of the data that internet
companies will be required keep on
you is unlikely to stay safe for long.
You only have to look back a few
weeks to the TalkTalk hack and it’s
obvious that it probably won’t just
be the government looking through
all the porn sites you’ve been on.
Then there’s the whole problem
of encryption which makes the
entire thing essentially useless
against anyone actively hiding their
activities. If you’re serious about
causing harm or committing an
act of terror it’s likely that you’re
encrypting your communication.
Making encryption illegal will do
nothing to stop that.
I wish there was something we
could do to stop this bill passing,
but in reality we’re powerless. No
one voted for the Conservatives in
the hope they would pass a bill like
this (if you did, then you’re an awful
person).
You have to start questioning
whetherwereallyliveinademocracy
(the answer is no). I just hope that
someone leaks all of Theresa May’s
metadata, then she might begin to
understand the true nature of what
she is proposing.

against those who wish us harm.
Our government’s definition of a
threat extends to anyone opposing
British values: democracy, the rule
of law,individual liberty,and mutual
respect and tolerance of those with
different faiths and beliefs. It’s a
definition so loose that you could
The North South divide is part of being a Brit
Why can’t we stop making fun of each other’s accents and get along?

here I come
from, in rainy
old Manchester,
I’m considered
relatively posh. Hop across the
imaginary divide though, and I
might as well have just come up
from the mines with a pie in one
hand and a ferret in the other.
Visits to see the family in Sussex
are always a reminder of this, as
many a time my mild “Northern
accent” has been pointed out, badly
impersonated and then ripped to
shreds. A Northerner, that’s what
I am. And people who live in the
South are Southerners.Two separate
peoples, within the same country.
Google the North-South divide
and it gives you a spiel about
cultural and economic differences.
Economics helps to explain some of
the origins of the divide; the South
being where the money flowed
and the North being left with the
equivalent of the Bountys in a box
of celebrations. But there’s more to
it than that.
Debates can go on for hours over
whose way is better and why. You’ve
heard it all before, but essentially
the bread and butter of the debate
is that southerners are snobs, and
northerners are rough. Southerners
shoot pheasants, northerners shoot
rats in the kitchen. Southerners
drink Chai lattes (no fat, no foam,
no point), northerners drink tea.
Southerners actually see the sun,
northerners don’t. But why do we
so often feel the need to point out
these differences? Can’t we all just
get along?
The simple answer is no, not
for now. For guidance, look at
something like the Tribal Instinct
Hypothesis, where it’s stated that
as a tribal species we are capable
of extreme compassion towards
members of our own groups, and
hostility towards others. A bit like
two separate ant colonies (also a
tribal species), North and South
are rival tribes. Thankfully there’s
no physical rivalry (i.e. punch ups
outside a chippy in Birmingham),
it’s just a subtle, underlying
competitiveness.
And of course there’s the element
of wanting to stick to what we know.
Such high
rents will
create
‘ghettos’ in
halls
For example, I know that I want my
tea in a mug, not a pissing teapot
and china.
However, although small cultural
differences will probably always
remain, the economic balance
does seem to be improving. With
George Osborne’s plans for the
Northern Powerhouse, the North
is proposed to have as large a role
in the economy as London and the
South East.
Not only will this impact the
North for the better, it will make
Britain stronger as a whole country.
Once united and free of the
economic divide, we can start to
embrace the quirks of where we
came from with much less of the
simmering resentment.
Despite this, Northerners and
Southerners will always feel
the need to comment on one
another’s pronunciation, eating
habits, drinking habits and general
existence. It’s part of what being
a Brit is all about. If we were all
exactly the same life would be a
little dull, and that’s something
neither side wants to be.
Imperial’s halls solution is a travesty
The accomodation rent hikes are extortion, plain and simple

Union Council Member
F
or the past five years,
when it comes to handling
accommodation issues,
Imperialhasbeenfollowing
the mantra that two wrongs make
a right and fixing problems by
creating new ones. Last year prices
were hiked in the South Kensington
halls by 10% to compensate for
the low rents in Woodward, since
Freshers need to pay for a zone
3 travel card. In what seemed a
victory last year, the Union Council
was allowed to set the rents, but the
College had a fixed bottom line, so
rents had to be hiked somewhere
else. The logic behind the increase
in fees in Beit and Prince’s Gardens,
was that if a fresher wants to live
close to campus, let them pay a
premium for it.
The issue was raised in the last
council meeting and as a member,
I am putting a motion forward for
the union to start lobbying college
to change rents. Such high rents
will create ‘ghettos’ in halls, since
only people from the same class and
same background will be able to
afford the rent. This endangers the
very essence and purpose of living
out, which is learning to live in a
diverse environment.
As a hall senior this year, I can tell
you that current prices are seriously
affecting students’ ability to go out,
drink, and party. In certain cases
some of them had to rely on the
£2000 emergency fund the college
has in place for students in difficulty.
At a starting price of £224 a week,
that’s the equivalent of £8500 a year
which a maintenance loan cannot
fully cover. With further cuts in
maintenance grants next year, there
is a genuine concern that people
from poorer backgrounds will never
be able to afford to live in a South
Kensington hall. Why are students
from disadvantaged backgrounds
being pushed out of central London
by the college and given an 80
minute daily commute? Why does
living in a hall close to campus
need to be considered a “luxury”
that justifies a premium, which has
recently turned to extortion with a
hike every year?
Fundamentally, why are students’
opinions being disregarded?
Frankly the answer is that we
were passive, we didn’t protest
against mistakes that were made
by college. We just read about it in
FELIX when the halls closed and
when the new ones opened, we
joked that we wouldn’t want to be
a fresher this year. The union came
up short in mobilising students and
raising awareness amongst them
concerning these issues. And then
comes mismanagement and flawed
logic from the College.
I find it surprising that a university
that’s been performing so well
academically is so badly managed
when it comes to student affairs.
People will desire an Imperial
education no matter what, but the
college has to learn not to take this
for granted.
