FILM
The top three
date-night films
that aren’t
The Notebook
O
k, I’ll admit it: The
Notebook is a good
film. It’s far from being
the be-all-and-end-
all romantic drama, but it’s by no
means awful. However, it has always
confused me as to how that film has
become the quintessential example
of romantic cinema. It is, to a lot of
burly men, ‘that film she made me
watch one time’. It may then please
you to know that there are much
better alternatives that everyone
can enjoy snuggled up in bed this
coming winter.
About Time (2013)
Richard Curtis – it’s probably
fair to say – is something of an
icon when it comes to romantic
comedies. From Love Actually to
Notting Hill, the rom-coms he has
written and occasionally directed are
true classics. About Time is an often
forgotten-about film of his, telling
the story of Tim who, at the age of
21, discovers he can time travel and
uses this to better his every day.The
film’s messages on life and love find
the director at his most sentimental.
Mamma Mia! (2008)
Mamma Mia! is probably the
cheesiest film that I will admit to
liking (and seeing multiple times
in the cinema. Please don’t tell
anyone).The weight of an emotional
drama film seems wholly uninviting
when you could have the kind of fun
a combination of ABBA songs and
Hollywood A-listers pissing about
can give you. With its gorgeous
Greek island setting, Mamma Mia!
is sure to fight the winter blues.
Wall-E (2008)
Theysaytosavethebestforlastand
WALL-E could well be the perfect
date night movie. Yes, I’m serious.
A gorgeous sci-fi epic, it boasts
brilliant action and fun alongside
honestly touching moments. The
romance between WALL-E and
EVE is always believable and never
cheap – more than can be said for
most romantic films. The feel good
ending following some genuinely
sad moments throughout will leave
both of you smiling.
The five most iconic moments of
Tilda Swinton
Last week saw the 55th anniversary of the birth of the saviour of
modern cinema, Tilda Swinton. To celebrate, we take a look back
at her legendary career; choosing what to feature was difficult, but
we have managed to narrow down five of her most iconic moments,
and what they teach us about life and art
1. Her
Collaborations
with Derek
Jarman
It could be said that the die was
cast as soon as Swinton appeared
in her first film. Caravaggio, a
fictionalised retelling of the Italian
painter, was directed by Derek
Jarman, and would be the first of
seven collaborations made until
Jarman’s death in 1994. Resolutely
art-house, but completely grounded
in English temperament and history,
Jarman’s work seemed to perfectly
2. Gender-
Bending in
Orlando
If one was to make a list of
unfilmable novels, Virginia Woolf’s
Orlando, a masterpiece of modern
literature, would be high on the
list: the story of a nobleman who
somehow lives for more than three
centuries, and changes sex half way
through the plot, it is a complex,
nuanced, convoluted exploration of
the messy nature of gender – and
completely unfilmable. At least,
until Sally Potter came along. Her
Orlando, released in 1992, is one of
3. Sleeping in
a Box in the
Name of Art
Swinton’s talents and interests lie
beyond the screen, as seen in her
1995 collaboration with Cornelia
Parker RA, The Maybe. Coming
to Parker with the idea for a
performance piece in which she
just slept, the artist designed a glass
vitrine, forming the centrepiece of
the Serpentine exhibition, in which
Swinton slept (or at least appeared
to) for seven hours a day.The Maybe
has since been restaged, in Rome in
1996, and most recently at MoMA
in 2013. For most actors, their
activities outside cinema lie mainly
4. Learning
New
Languages for I
Am Love
I Am Love, Luca Guadagnino’s
2009 film about a Milanese
industrial family, saw Swinton
5. Being Normal
in Trainwreck
When Amy Schumer wrote the
description for tyrannical magazine
boss Dianna in her film Trainwreck,
she described her as ‘dressed like
Tilda Swinton would at an airport’.
Little did she know that they would
soon have Swinton on board as
a collaborator; but more shocked
were the audience members – used
to seeing Swinton as some kind of
mercurial ice goddess with cropped
peroxide hair, in Trainwreck she
dons a long flowing wig, and hella
make-up in order to look… well,
pretty normal actually. She pulled
a similar trick in Lynne Ramsey’s
starkly powerful We Need To Talk
About Kevin, where she plays the
mother of a boy who commits a
school shooting. Split between
before and after the shooting, we
see her character of Eva physically
transformed by the immensity of
her grief and guilt. It’s a travesty
that she wasn’t nominated for an
Academy Award for what is a career
highlight.
While Trainwreck is perhaps the
mostextremeofhertransformations,
Swinton has a long history of
disguising herself before the camera.
In Bong Joon-Ho’s masterfully dark
machinery dystopia Snowpiercer she
plays Mason, the cynical enforcer of
order on a train carrying the last of
humanity;devoid of human warmth,
and given a horrible set of fake teeth,
she’s channelling Margret Thatcher
with prosthetic floppy breasts.
Elsewhere, in Wes Anderson’s
delightful The Grand Budapest Hotel,
she has a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it
cameo as Madam D, the part-time
lover of Ralph Fiennes’ Gustav
H – aged thirty years through the
use of elaborate make-up effects
and cloudy contact lenses. Swinton
clearly delights in messing around
with her appearance, eschewing the
traditionally enforced Hollywood
narrative of younger equals better,
and striking a blow for equality.
FRED FYLES
suit the ethereal qualities Swinton
brought to the screen; perhaps the
last great English auteur, his death
was a blow for experimental cinema,
one that – with the rise of Joanna
Hogg and Clio Barnard – we are
just about getting over.
This early work grounded Swinton
resolutely within the world of
experimentalism, and whilst she has
moved on to numerous big-budget
productions, she never seems to
have lost her original approach to
the medium: one of curiosity, love,
and generousness. Without the
attention of Derek Jarman back in
the 1980s, the Tilda Swinton we
know of today would probably not
exist. As she said: ‘he opened the
door with a camera on me, and
never turned it off’.
the cleverest adaptations of a novel
ever to grace cinema; a sumptuous
work, the look and tone of the film
is one of ravishment.
And who else would be able to
play Orlando, the gender-switching
immortal, than Tilda Swinton?
With her angular face and beguiling
air, Swinton displays the true spirit
of androgyny. As Patti Smith said,
‘she is both princess and prince’, a
quality she displayed when playing
the Archangel Gabriel in the 2005
film Constantine, and will display
again next year in the upcoming
film Doctor Strange, in which she
has not decided whether to play
her character as male or female.
Swinton has managed to transcend
the binary, showing us all that
gender is truly performative.
Tilda
Swinton is
cinema’s
true
modern-day
polymath
taking on perhaps her greatest
challenge yet. Playing a Russian
Emigreé, she speaks Italian for
pretty much the entire film, with a
few scenes showing her speaking
Russian. For any usual actor who
was not brought up bilingual (or
at least learning a second language
from an early age), such a prospect
would seem daunting, but Swinton
took to it like a duck to water,
crafting in Emma Recchi one of
her most nuanced, rich characters
to date.
Her second feature collaboration
with Guadagnino, A Bigger Splash,
sees her playing the famous rock
star Marianne Lane, and appearing
in the latest issue of AnOther
magazine in character. A Bigger
Splash was shown at the London
Film Festival last month and will

receive a full release next year. But
Swinton clearly knows how to pick
her collaborators well, and stick
with them for the long haul: she
first met Guadagnino over 20 years
ago, when he had only just finished
film school. Not afraid to take on
dangerous roles, Swinton appeals
to other actors to raise their game,
and bring the art of cinema up as
a whole
in the fashion world, acting as
muses to designers, or appearing in
high fashion advertising campaigns.
Swinton has – of course – done her
fair share of this, advertising for
Chanel and Pringle, and modelling
in Viktor & Rolf shows. But her
talents and interests are diverse,
whether it’s appearing as David
Bowie’s wife in the video for The
Stars (Are Out Tonight), or helping
to start an alternative school in rural
Scotland, Swinton is cinema’s true
modern-day polymath.
