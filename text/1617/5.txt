Feminism isn’t just for girls
Back this week from fighting the patriarchy, Angry Grad asks why we aren’t all
embracing equal rights
W
hile my usual pieces
have a satirical take
on pop culture, this
week, I thought it
was about time my graduate anger
is channelled towards an issue that
actually has some weight. From the
recent uproar regarding VAT on
sanitary products, to men, mental
health and suicide, you must have
been living in a pineapple under
the sea to be oblivious to the media
frenzy surrounding gender equality
lately.
I’ve had countless conversations
with my friends about feminism,
and I’ve been struck by some
serious misunderstandings of what
feminism is. And I want to clarify
this: it wasn’t just my male friends
who seemed misinformed.
I’m fully aware that I’m not an
expert on the issue, and I’m far
from what one would call an ideal
advocate for gender equality.Yet, it’s
an issue that, I believe, needs more
publicity, more support, and most
importantly, clarification on what it
stands for.
First things first. I am a feminist,
and I am proud to say so. This
however, does not mean I host
head-shaving parties in my garden,
complete with a burning bin in
the centre, which myself and other
feminists gallop around, flailing
our bras like lassos, chanting
man-hating Sanskrit mantras and
engaging in voodoo on Ken dolls.
Since when has being a feminist
afraid of the connotations associated
with the title.
Pretty much every type of
movement that exists has some
barbaric fanatics,and feminism is no
exception; man-haters are out there,
and I acknowledge this. But these
individuals are a far cry from what
feminism represents.The movement
represents a fight for equality, and
last time I checked, the notion of
equality wasn’t a radical one.
For the record, feminism is not
synonymous with man hating. It is
not about fighting for a matriarchy.
It is not a thinly veiled attack on
men, in order to undermine and
suppress them in society. Rather,
it’s a movement with re-thinking
gender roles at the forefront of its
aims, for both men and women.
Regarding women, the issues that
demonstrate that we need feminism
are endless. I obviously will not
touch on everything, but a couple
of issues really peeve me. As I’ve
mentioned, we’re taxed for having
something that closely resembles a
murder scene in our pants once a
month. Apparently cleaning up a
bleeding vag is a luxury these days.
Combined this with the searing
back and stomach cramps, my, aren’t
we ruddy pampered!
Let’s not forget issues with
our personalities too; my drive,
motivation and determination are
actually “bossy,” and “intimidating.”
Hell, we can see this in action at
Imperial itself, which houses a load
of successful female scientists and
professors. I’ve heard these women
talked about as “controlling, short-
tempered,” and when they’re a
tad blunt with their orders, “she
must be on the blob.” Their male
counterparts however, well, they’re
driven, changing the game, and a
role model to look up to.
What the hell is this all about?
I, myself, am guilty in perceiving
women like this, which is pretty
disgusting. There’s no point in
motivating more young girls to get
into STEM subjects, if when they
get there, their authority is belittled.
I don’t know how we’re going to go
about changing this and I cannot
offer any ground-breaking solutions.
But I guess recognition of our biases
is a great way to start – next time
you deem a girl bossy,think whether
you’d call a dude the same thing.
But why do we need to re-think
gender roles for men? Men seem to
have it easier compared to women,
right? They generally hold greater
positions of power, earn more, and
aren’t thought to be suppressed in
society. Patriarchy is pretty neat for
you guys isn’t it?
From young boys shamed for
being weak and expressing emotion,
to grown men, expected to be the
provider and emotional rock for
their families, patriarchy imposes
ridiculous pressures on men of all
ages to conform to its ludicrous
order.
I’ve seen young men – my friends
– suffering from mental illnesses,
unable to express their emotions
49, eclipsing cancer, road accidents
and coronary heart disease. Yet,
literature shows that women suffer
more from depression. But it’s
not un-womanly to seek help, and
it’s not un-womanly to cry. The
infatuation with being macho, the
obsession with the stiff upper lip –
these things evidently contribute to
the fragility of the mental state.
Men are imprisoned by gender
stereotypes too,and what constitutes
male success is in desperate need
of reform. Men would clearly reap
the benefits of gender equality as
well, and it’s now imperative that
men are invited to and become
advocates of feminism – not just to
empower women, but to break free
of the irrational gender stereotypes
themselves.

It wasn’t just
my male
friends who
seemed
misinformed
also meant that you’re a radical?
Some women would rather have
daily bikini waxes than associate
themselves with feminism, not
because they are non-believers in
gender equality, but rather they’re
and robbed of their right to be
sensitive, in fear of being perceived
as less manly, or God forbid, a girl.
In fact, suicide is the biggest killer
of men between the ages of 20 and
