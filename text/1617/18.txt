GAMES
Love, sex, and the internet
N
ina Freeman has
made a name for
herself developing
weird and wonderful
autobiographical games. Many
of them only take minutes to
play; however, in these vignettes,
Freeman pushes the boundaries
of the medium more than any ten
hour epic has ever been able to do.
Much of the appeal of Freeman’s
work stems from her willingness to
explore themes that most developers
find uncomfortable. Take ‘how do
you DO it’ for example; it’s a game
about a young girl trying to work
out how sex works by positioning
two dolls. In ‘Freshman Year’, she
explores the much more serious
issue of unwanted attention. For
some, her games can be triggering
or painful, but for others they’re
often comforting.
Freeman offers a refreshing
female perspective in an industry
dominated by men. And by
focusing on her teenage years and
time at college, she is always able
to make something that is easy for
any millennial, regardless of sex, to
engage with.
Her latest game, ‘Cibele’, follows
her online relationship with Blake,
a man she met while playing Final
Fantasy Online. We are given full
It’s worrying how much we can
learn about someone through their
digital presence; we’re moving fast
towards a world where every other
thought or communication exists
in a record online. And because we

live so much of our lives through
screens, we often struggle with
real life encounters. These do exist
in ‘Cibele’ in the form of short in-
game videos. They paint a picture
of a young women struggling with
her own self-image and sexuality.
‘Cibele’ focuses on the awkward
interactions and self-confidence
issues that are intertwined with
online communication and
relationships. Discovering your
sexuality online in the 21st
century
is a far different experience from
that of our parents.
As a teenager, I always struggled
to reflect on my own life quite like
‘Cibele’.
The flirting, sexting and awkward
compliments that take place online
are no replacement for physical
intimacy. And when we do extend
an online relationship beyond
the web, it rarely lives to our
expectations. It’s sad that future
generations might discover their
sexuality entirely through the
internet.
While Freeman never expresses
this concern explicitly in ‘Cibele’,
it’s painfully obvious from
the disappointment that her
relationship ends
The power of sex plays an
increasingly important role
throughout the game and its ending.
But for a piece of work that Nina
herself describes as being about sex,
the act itself is surprisingly absent.
I have a lot of respect for Freeman.
By putting per own personal
experiences in a game she allows
us to reflect on own lives in ways
few games have done in the past.
There were many times where I saw
myself in Blake and Nina.
There was a moment where I was
reminded of the first time I told a
girl over Facebook that she was
“cute” (a fact which she quickly
refuted).
A game has never done that to me
before.

in and outside of school. Luckily,
I soon grew out of my social
awkwardness, but like many of
our generation I always found it
easy to interact with others online:
“It’s easier to talk when you’re not
looking at someone.” Some of
my activity online could probably
have been described as creeping,
however, after playing ‘Cibele’ and
seeing Nina Freeman’s experience
as a teenager I now realise this was
the norm for a 14 or 15 year old
growing up in the internet age.

access to Freeman’s life through
her desktop; intimate and revealing
emails, photos, chat logs, poems,
and blog drafts all tell us a little
more about teenage Nina. It feels
incredibly invasive given the
fact that in reality we are rarely
given the chance to look through
someone’s personal files.
