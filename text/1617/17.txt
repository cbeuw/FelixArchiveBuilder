n my impressive ignorance this
week, I went to see the Belarus
Free Theatre thinking that
Belarus is now a free country.
Turns out Belarus is still a fun-
loving repressive regime, and the

powerful, but also remarkably

Belarus Free Theatre’s Staging a Revolution coincides with the Million Masks march
worse when censoring art. That is
why I applaud Nikolai.
Performed in a secret location as
part of their ‘Staging a Revolution’
festival, the evening simulated what
it is like consuming art in a repressive
regime. The crowd assembles at
an undisclosed location before
being taken in small groups to the
performance space. The audience
are given blankets, soup and a drink
and we all squeeze together on
these long benches. For ‘Generation
Jeans’ we’re sitting in a Westminster
car park. It isn’t exactly flattering,
but the whole process gives so
much more weight to the political
message behind BFT’s production.
There is a genuine vibe to the event,
a vibe even the few hotspots left in
London can’t recreate. This isn’t just
one man and his audience, but a
powerful communal movement.
but much harder to do. Regardless,
whether we act or not, art might
not confront a regime directly, but
it is a constant reminder of what
we are missing, and the issues we’ve
forgotten about.
The night I went to see the
Belarus Free Theatre, we were
in Westminster alongside the
‘Million Masks’ march. As we left
the car park, we walked past the
last remnants of the Met’s kettle.
Looking at the regimes abroad, it
is so easy to feel safe at home, but
seeing the Government’s treatment
of protesters and the unsettling
tribal tactics of the police is just a
reminder of how thin the line is.
We can sit back, passive, and let
the protest movements walk by, but
don’t complain when in thirty years
you’re not happy with the regime
we’ve built.

the media carries far greater weight
when delivered through art. Of the
numerousChinesedissidents,itisAi
Weiwei who is best known globally,
and of all the LGBT campaigners
in Russia, Pussy Riot hold the most
traction with the media. There are
more but you get the idea – for
some reason art reaches the heights
of resistance closed off to more
conventional resistance.
Delivered in Belarussian, the
audience are oddly removed from
‘Generation Jeans’, but the moral is
poignant, touching and provocative.
In all honesty, the play in itself
doesn’t really interest me and in all
likelihood I won’t remember any of
the details come next year, but there
is a standing ovation none the less.
The content isn’t really crucial, it is
the attack against freedom of speech
and expression that seems so much
But as I write this, despite my
convictions, I find it hard not to be
at least a bit cynical.For all the news
I read, it does so often feel that art
is treated as a medium for leisure –
insignificant when confronted with
the real global problems. For all the
sunflower seeds Ai Weiwei could
possibly carve, the actual difference
to people’s lives under a repressive
regime feels insignificant. Despite
the protest anthems of Billy Bragg
and co, the wars in the Middle East
went on. What does art actually
achieve? Is awareness enough? It
is because of this that we find it
so easy to fall into the usual cycle
of disillusionment whereby the
first drowned Syrian child sparks
outrage but the next falls on deaf
ears.Will we ever get more engaged,
I hope so, but I say this with the
full knowledge that it’s easy to talk
current. In their one-man show
‘Generation Jeans’, BFT’s co-
founder and political activist
Nikolai Khalezin tells his story of
jeans and rock music as a symbol of
freedom in Belarus.
While the work in itself doesn’t
blow me away, the play has a far
greater symbolic importance.
While the spirit of protest and
resistance is embodied across a
whole spectrum of disciplines and
actions, it is protest art whose voice
shouts the loudest and echoes the
longest. Peaceful process refined to
a simple, powerful message, it isn’t
immediately obvious but protest in
