I
mperial 2s made the journey
to West Ham on Wednesday
to play their 4th
match of the
season against East London
University 1st
XV. After an easy ride
so far in the league, Imperial were
hoping for an opposition that would
provide some serious competition to
test the lads’ capabilities. After the
first few minutes it was clear that
this was not going to be the case.All
it took were a few good phases and
solid line breaks in the opposition
22 for IC to cross the white wash
early on.
Imperial were up against a side
with big runners, but this threat was
cut off at source with good tackling
from the team all around. We were
able to punch some holes ourselves,
with big running from the back line.
Captain Gavin Roberts also proved
himself very difficult to stop, with
his small stature and quick legs hard
to follow, sometimes even by his
own team. Backs moves flowed well,
often being finished by the wheels
on winger Will Goldberg. The rest
of the game went on in a similar
fashion, with four tries completed
by the end of the first half.
Nominated goal kicker, Kieran
Donnelly, had a good game off the
tee, bar failing to slot one directly
in front of the posts, blaming
chat from the opposition for his
misdemeanour.
After the first half, it was clear
that Imperial were the dominant
side. The second half started with
Imperial tries, and finished with
Imperial tries. IC finally met some
good competition in the scrums,
but after 60 minutes they went
uncontested following a knock
to the head taken by opposition
hooker. A clean sheet was kept
thanks to a solid D all around from
the boys, and in particular, good
cover tackles from Carlos Sheppard.
The forwards played well as a pack,
being dominant in the lineouts in
both attack and defence, and also in
the scrum with awesome steals from
hooker, John Welsh.
Towards the end of the match,
Imperial were playing against a
13-man side after two opposition
players went off with injury with no
one to replace them – perhaps an
unnecessary additional advantage
for College. To everyone’s relief, the
match was called off five minutes
early after two tries in quick
succession from IC, and that was it.
Final score 65-0. Quite easily the
most clinical performance from the
Imperial 2s so far.
