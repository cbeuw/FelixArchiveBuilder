T
here are those for whom
fashion excites, fabric
enthrals, and whose lives
are inescapably moulded
by fads and faddism.And then there
are others who, like me, are content
to live more or less on the periphery
of this bustling, chaotic, colourful
world; whose fashion choices are
merely a function of proximity to
an item in the wardrobe. I am only
too content to flip a coin to match
socks, and wear stripes with plaid.
I felt, going into The Fabric of India
much like the fictional Bertram
Wooster, confessing to his trusted
gentleman’s gentleman: “There are
moments, Jeeves, when one asks
oneself, ‘Do trousers matter?’”
Ultimately,this exhibition was not
really about India, but about why
fabric matters, on a global scale.
The Indian subcontinent merely
happens to be one of the biggest
players in the game. The first part
of the exhibition focuses on nature.
For all that is materialistic and man-
made about the world of garments
and garb,it is inextricably tied to the
natural world for inspiration and for
the pillaging.The glorious tone that
is Indigo – taking its name from
‘India’ – has been extracted from
plants for millennia to colour yarn
and fabric. And where else could we
turn to for the bright exuberant reds
but the lac beetle, whose secreted
resin is still used these days to make
dye? Curiously, there is no efficient
natural source for green, a colour
almost synonymous with nature –
instead, one combines yellow and
indigo.
Beforetheworldofthemechanical
Jacquard loom, it was up to the
talent and craftsmanship of weavers
to make exquisite garments. On one
hand, the perfection and intricacy
of the designs are a testament to
a great art that has been lost with
the advent of machines, but on the
other hand, there a sense of great
poignancy to our proud exhibitions
of imperfection: The pre-industrial
poppy shawl demanded two days of
work from three craftsmen for every
few inches of fabric,and in this scale
of effort and sheer hard work there
is something other than mechanical
perfection or a polished finishing to
appreciate.
It is no wonder, then, that fabrics
came to represent a microcosm of
cultural identity – the hopes, dream
and fears of an entire people. It was
a stab at immortality,an opportunity
to preserve for antiquity one’s most
inner identity in a piece of fabric.To
use the word ‘antiquity’ may seem
like a venture into hyperbole, but
when I stand before a 6000-year-
old piece of Indian fabric excavated
in Jordon – intact and bursting with
colour – it appears as though the art
of making and decorating fabric has
outlived the majority of literature,
sculpture, and visual art.
The oldest religious stories have
been encoded in fabric, such as the
Kanamaraju epic, the Ramayana,
and the Mahabharata – a 2,500 year
old epic narrative (one of the oldest
in the world) that is told and retold
through countless metres of cloth.
Fabric is also central to Hindu
tradition in the form of the sacred
thread of the priest, the upavita.The
culturalidentityofIndianChristians
is also preserved in fabric; South
Indian craftsmen drew on imagery
from Armenian manuscripts to tell
Biblical tales. Jain embroideries are
embedded with sacred Kusha grass,
and Tibetan lotuses line Buddhist
prints.Often,words from the Quran
are written into the fabric – the so
called “Talismanic shirt” was worn
under battle dress and during times
of illness. Islamic prayer mats are of
great cultural importance because
they facilitate the touching of the
forehead to the floor during prayer.
It is hard to imagine religious life
in India without the significance
of fabrics, and this point is driven
home rather well.
One of the biggest sections of the
exhibition focuses on trade – there
seems to be no country that India
has not borrowed from, or has not
borrowed from India. Thanks to
the miracle of carbon dating, we
know that more than a thousand
years ago, Gujarati block prints
were a part of daily Egyptian life.
Mughal embroidery from the
1600s depicts lilies, derived from
European botanical illustrations,
while some hangings have cranes,
pine trees, oriental dragons, and
intricate waterfalls all reminiscent
of Japanese art. In Japan, Indian
under-kimonos were all the fad in
the 1800s, and in the same century
European men wore gaudy chintzes
in public. An entire room is devoted
to a 17-metre wall hanging from
rural Gujarat that was found
dumped on a New York pavement
twenty years ago outside a Brooklyn
warehouse. There is a breathtaking
serendipity to it all – how did it get
there? How did it get back to the
V&A? Moreover, there is a sense
of humanity – a tall wall hanging
depicting European men was made
to be hung together with two other
hangings of Indian men and women,
to create via dramatic juxtaposition
a gallery of human figures.
The climax of the exhibition
appears to be with the political
statement made in 1920s India by
a certain weaver and cotton-spinner
who went by the name of Gandhi.
‘Khadi’ is the name of a type of
cloth, but has come to represent
an entire political movement,
where the central ideology was
that Indians could be self-reliant
and independent from the highly-
priced British clothes (made from
cheaply bought Indian cotton that
was exported to Britain to be woven
and brought back to be sold at hefty
prices). Central to the freedom
struggle was the symbolic act of
rejecting foreign-made garments
and wearing only hand-spun,
hand-woven fabric. When Gandhi
travelled to the United Kingdom,
he continued to dress in khadi, fully
aware of its symbolism – Churchill
believed that his style of clothing
was akin to political manipulation,
Do trousers matter?
The V&A’s Fabric of India reveals stories of culture and politics behind the woven craft
Abhinav Varma
Writer
describing him as a “half-naked holy
man”. Gandhi would hold great
spinning-wheel demonstrations
where he not only taught the masses
to make their own cotton thread
but also galvanised them to revolt.
The spinning wheel found its place
on the flag of the Indian Congress,
the first democratic political
party to come into power post-
independence, and is symbolised by
the wheel on the flag even today.To
this day, the Indian flag continues
to be made from hand-woven khadi
cloth.
In these pieces of fabric, there is
nothing less than a microcosm of an
entire culture, an entire civilisation,
and the lasting traces of their most
beautiful, and most important ideas.
Overwhelmed by the powerful
statement of art, culture and the
identity made by something as
innocuous as a piece of cloth, I
am forced to consider that there
is a distinct possibility that when
I reach for my coin and fumble
through my wardrobe in the dark, I
might reconsider my callous pairing
of socks and think to myself that
perhaps, after all, trousers really do
matter.
V&A until 10 Jan. Tickets from £9.

You lambasted the church for its promulgation
Of interdiction, a formality blurring
Real treasures: if only you had lived to see in
Our times,
the blight of the world of without, slating
The veiled divine truth within the dim chapel knaves,
Where flickering candles offer hope to men, bring
Kindling to the pneuma, searing belly’s meat. Save
For this mere shadow of mediation, there would
Be nought. In times like these, Christ’s rage makes sense: he caved
In just the once at the Pharisees’ arrogance, Wood
Of the word splintering like the merchant’s tables
In the temple: the harmonious fulcrum should
Not fall to the sins of men. I’ll take the trick
Of the church, truth’s mediated whim, over mania.
