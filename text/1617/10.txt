ust Bollywood – the
nationwide fusion-dance
competition organised by
IndianSoc, is back!
After its wildly successful first
year, the competition promises to be
even more exciting and entertaining
this time round. Ten teams across
the country will be fighting to be
crowned the Bollywood champions
of the UK.
Each team is assigned a specific
theme and a prop, to integrate
creatively within their eight-
minute set. The teams aim to
explore a diverse range of dance
styles, maintain execution and
create dynamic formations, all
whilst staying true to the colourful,
extravagant nature of Bollywood.
You can definitely expect fierce
competition, as this year the show
will adopt a head-to-head format,
with Team Imperial taking on Team
Cambridge!
The 2014 Imperial JB team put
on a spectacular performance last
year, winning 1st
place with their
Bollywood adaptation of the classic
movie Pretty Woman.
We hope the 2015 team can
follow in their footsteps and defend
our title. The next few weeks will
consist of hard work, dedication
and intense training. Led by the
two captains Roshni Mitra and
Trisha Ghosh, Team Imperial will
be pulling out all stops to create
another passionate, unforgettable
performance. This year a pre-
show mini round has been added,
intensifying the competition
further!
Each team has produced a short
dance video, now live on the JB
Facebook page, featuring a taste of
the talent to come. The Imperial
JB team needs your help to ensure
our success during this first round:
a simple Facebook like on our JB
dance video is all it takes.
The team with the most likes on
their video will be rewarded with
an advantage on the day of the
competition, so please do take a
moment to visit the Just Bollywood
Facebook page! Come supportTeam
Imperial at the show on Sunday 13th
December and see the talent from
all over the country.With renowned

Just Bollywood is back!
Ten teams are ready to fight to become the 2015 Champion
judges and incredible performances,
Just Bollywood will not disappoint.
You can’t miss it!
Y
ou only have to pick
up the paper on any
given day to admire
the latest technological
advancement or scientific
breakthrough our students and
researchers have made, but keep
in mind that folk here also have
incredible talent in many facets
outside of academia. The end-of-
winter term is when this becomes
most apparent, with almost every
room on campus filled with
performances put on by our myriad
societies.
For most groups, this will be the
firsttimetheyarelettingtheirnewest
members loose on a live audience,
so it’s all a healthy mix of nerves
and anticipation. This is especially
the case for certain groups with
members who have just graduated,
leaving only half of their previous
membership intact. For many, this
will be the first performance that
really shows how well they’re doing
without old members.
Many of you must have
encountered the talent of Musical
Theatre and DramaSoc with their
performances in the Union Concert
Hall (shows on 2nd
- 4th
December
and 7th
- 12th
December respectively),
and the more classically-oriented
Symphony and Sinfonietta with
performances in the Great Hall
(27th
November and 4th
December
respectively). However, it’s the
whole host of groups that disappear
off campus you should look out for
too, as you might miss a real treat
otherwise.
For example, both Chamber
Choir and Choir have their Autumn
concerts in the Holy Trinity Church
on the 19th
and 22nd
November
respectively, and that’s not even
half of what to expect. Make sure
you indulge yourself in the ultimate
end-of-year line-up!
Brace yourself for End-of-Term

W
hat do you picture
when you hear the
word ‘magician’? If
you think of ‘that
guy’ at a party, sloppily doing lame
tricks he learnt an hour ago from
Youtube, then I’m here to change
that. If you imagine a sad man in
his thirties doing kids’ parties, filled
with self-loathing due to poor life
decisions, then I’m here to change
that too.
Unfortunately, these common
generalisations of magic are mostly
true, but I’d like to attempt to show
you a glimpse from deeper inside
the rabbit hole. There aren’t any
flying broomsticks, but hopefully
there’s something you’ll find cool,
perhaps even beautiful.
I’ll attempt to show you some
powerful magic, not by showing you
the coolest trick,but by showing you
the kind of wonderful experience
a spectator can have. If you type
“Derren Brown mystery box” into
Youtube, then you’ll find a two
part video of a routine from one of
Derren’s brilliant stage shows. Pay
special attention to the spectators’
reactions, and don’t read the
Youtube comments unless you want
a thousand incorrect theories about
the trick’s method.
I’m almost certain that you won’t
have bothered to actually go to
Youtube to look up the video, so
I’ll attempt to describe it in words.
Derren invites a random member of
the audience who has lost an older
relative on stage. The spectator’s
name is Emma, and the relative is
her grandmother, Doris. Derren
then tells a story in which his own
grandfather kept an old wooden
box on his shelf, and told Derren
that he should never, under any
circumstances, open the box. We
always want what we can’t have,
and obviously he wanted more than
anything to know what was inside.
After a couple of years, his
grandfather passed away, and
Derren was left with this box, and
was finally able to see what was
inside. To his surprise, the box
contained a coin, made of solid
silver, with 7 words engraved on it.
The words were, “Derren I told you
not to look”.
You can imagine why this became
one of Derren’s prized possessions,
and this story becomes the catalyst
for the magical plot about to follow.
On stage is a locked box,and Emma
is given the key. She opens the box,
and inside is another silver coin.
This time, engraved on the coin, are

Magicians, assemble!
the words, “In loving memory of
Doris”.
This magical climax, combined
with the backstory of Derren’s
grandfather, causes a flood of
emotions to rush through Emma.
The fond memories of her own
grandmother are mixed with the
surprise of the impossible coin, to
create a truly unique experience
that can’t be had elsewhere in the
entertainment world.
Not bad right? Different from
the awful, tuxedo-wearing, wand-
bearing stereotypes you’ll find if you
search ‘magician’ on google images.
But an interesting fact about every
magician, even the good ones, is
that we all go through the exact
same journey.
The reason someone starts learning
magic is almost always a lack of
self-esteem. Why else would you
want to learn a skill that basically
says “please look at me, aren’t I
amazing”? Learning sleight of hand
requires a good amount of practice,
and only those who don’t have the
chance to do more fun things, like
going to parties or having friends,
have the time to spend their teenage
lives practising in front of a mirror.
And then, even after you’ve spent
far too much time learning your
new abilities when you could have
been developing genuine social
skills, then you’ve got to be ‘that
guy’ for at least two years. The guy
who carries four decks of cards and
six pieces of rope everywhere; who
crowbars a magic trick into every
social interaction; who wears mostly
black and maybe even,God forbid,a
playing card tie. Welcome to magic
puberty.
At this point most of your friends
have probably disowned you, but
if you’ve made it this far then
you’ll now have the experience to
perform tricks that won’t cause your
spectators to roll their eyes, and
perhaps even provoke a genuine
smile in the right people.
If this all sounds good to you, god
knows why it would, then maybe
you have what it takes to become a
magician yourself. If you stick with
it long enough, then who knows,
maybe you’ll become so remarkable
that you’ll change what people
think of when they hear the word
magician, to you.
I’m looking to start a magic
society, so if you’re already
into magic, or if you’re keen to
learn, then drop me an email
at jxz12@ic.ac.uk with a link to
your Facebook, and I’ll add you
to a group where I’m gathering
anybody who would consider
joining.
