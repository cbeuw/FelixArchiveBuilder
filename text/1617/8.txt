V
ice President of Virgin
Galactic and Imperial
alumnus, Jonathon Firth,
is involved in developing
the first commercial spaceflight
company. He attended the 2015
SpaceLab conference last month,
where he cornered him for an
interview.
FELIX: Would you mind telling
us a little about your background,
and how you ended up at Imperial?
JF: I studied Mechanical
Engineering at Imperial, and
am actually a fourth generation
mechanical engineer. I was born
in Cumbria, and grew up in
Manchester. Imperial seemed like
the place to go when it came to
applying to university, so I ended
up here. My son is actually also
a mechanical engineer, so it’s
something of a family profession,
even though I didn’t steer him
towards it.
FELIX: During your time at
Imperial, is there anything in
particular that you learnt that’s
stuck with you?
JF: I think I learnt how to enjoy
myself. I went to an all boys’ school
before university, but coming here
really opened me up.I did IC Radio,
and was on the publications board
whilst here. In my third year I also
chaired the Union general meetings.
Overall, it opened up my social
side and some of the things that
I did were very good experience;
for example public speaking and
working with limited finances.
FELIX: Is there anything
particularlycrazythatyouremember
happening whilst here?
JF: The most memorable thing
was definitely the Iranian Embassy
Hostage Crisis. I was in Weeks Hall
[a former Imperial hall of residence
in Princes’ Gardens, now closed] at
the time, revising for exams, and it
was Easter of 1980. After the first
hostages were taken there were
security people everywhere – asking
us who we were, where we were
going, and so on.
It ended with the Embassy
being stormed, and a huge fire. We
watched from the warden’s flat at
the top of the hall as the SAS took
the building.
FELIX: And after Imperial, how
did you end up at Virgin Galactic?
JF: After graduation I ended up
working in oil and gas. I’d always
liked doing ‘projects’, and the oil
industry had plenty of those for me
to do.I started out as a pressure vessel
engineer, but knew that I didn’t
want a technical career. Rather, I
was more interested in how people
work together on projects, and so
on. However by 1981 the business
was starting to tail off a little, as the
oil price began to fall.
So, I ended up working on
mass-transit projects for London
Underground, specifically on the
modernisation of the Central and
Northern Lines. This included
some interesting ideas, for example
a joint public/private partnership
to fund the rolling stock. Virgin
was looking at this model after the
privatisation of British Rail, and
approached me to work on the West
Coast Mainline and Cross Country
franchises, which they had just won.
Theindustrywasintransformation,
but it wasn’t an area I’d worked in
before. After time with the railways
division of Virgin, I ended up
working for Virgin Atlantic, and
then someone asked me if I wanted
to move to Virgin Galactic – and
that’s how I ended up there.
FELIX: Did you have any
particular interest in space before
that?
JF: I didn’t have any particular
professional interest in space, but
there was definitely a casual interest.
I knew lots of space scientists,
people who remembered watching
the Moon landings in the 1960s,and
Helen Sharman getting selected as a
UK astronaut in the 1980s was also
quite exciting. Besides, at Virgin we
never quite knew what was going to
happen in the next week!
FELIX: Richard Branson – what’s
it like working with him?
JF: He’s always interested in
what’s going on, but he does make
sure to let the management team
run things. It’s a bit like branded
venture capital in a way? It is good
though that he keeps in touch and
comes to milestone events, and he’s
always said that he’ll be on the first
commercial flight.
FELIX: So what would you say
the fundamental reason for Virgin
Galactic’s existence is?
JF: Well, it is in effect customer
experience driven engineering. Our
product needed to be something
that satisfied the pilots who wanted
to fly in space as well as in planes,
the baby boomers who remembered
the Apollo missions, and also the
thrill seekers.
Initially, the company was
structured to do just this. We’d
refined the model over time, for
example moving away from the idea
of having a single-person spaceship.
Now we also plan to branch out
and launch small satellites off of the
parent vehicle. We want to make
sure we accommodate the customer’s
needs, rather than making them
conform to our specifications in the
way that most other space launch
companies do. Fundamentally, we
want to be flexible and available –
someone once used the phrase the
‘Uber of Space’ to describe us.

to go into the space industry as a
Alumnus goes Galactic

career,is there anything in particular
that you would recommend?
JF: The UK has great ambitions to
growitsspaceindustry–forexample,
it wants to have 10% of the world’s
market share by 2030. It won’t be
able to do this unless it can attract
talent. So I would say follow your
interests and passions, but overall I
would recommend engineering. It
gives you a wide range of areas to
work in and does not predestine you
to a particular field. I also think it
gives you sound judgement – you
might not know the right answer,
but you know the sounds that the
wrong answer makes.
FELIX: So what should people
follow – passion, or interest?
JF: It has to be a balance. You
have to make a living as well, so I’d
say think about the salary but don’t
make it all about that.
FELIX: And what is it that
inspires and motivates you?
JF: I think I’m one of those people
who are self-motivated, in a way it’s
baked in. That’s partly a product of
my upbringing and partly a product
of coming to Imperial. I never wait
to be asked to do something. I can
sit read a book to relax, but will
never do nothing.
FELIX: Okay, so what would a
typical day look like for you?
JF: To be honest, it probably
wouldn’t be particularly exciting!
There’s normally something on the
outreach side every other day, which
is good. Our spaceport is out in the
Mojave Desert in New Mexico,
but occasionally I find myself back
in London which I like. I spend a
lot of time on reports, talking to
stakeholders and customers and in
discussions with employees, just the
same as everyone else.
FELIX: Would you want to be
on one of Virgin Galactic’s first
commercial flights then?
JF: Absolutely, I always assumed
that I would be. Once upon a time
we all thought that we were going
to be flying, back when it was just
five or six of us. Now there’s 520
people in the company, so we won’t
all be flying. Possibly after testing
is completed but before entry into
service we’ll a chance for some
employees to try it out.
FELIX: That sounds very cool.
Anyhow, thank you very much for
your time!
