This week you are so
overjoyed by the return of
Blue News that you write to
Alice Gast to thank her for
such a wonderful publication.
You don’t really get satire, do
you, hun?

This week you are a worker
in the Faculty Building. You
notice with some trepidation
the return of Blue News,
and are incensed by the
implication that some of your
meetings feature yoga mats.
Our bad. It’s actually all of
them.
This week, you’re booking
an act for the Imperial
West to raise morale at the
new campus. After finding
someone on Craigslist you
assume to be a cut-price
magician, you find you’ve
accidentally hired George
Osborne. The builders are
unimpressed.
This week you are an old man
on the moon. Unfortunately,
you discover that not only
has a small girl been spying
on you, but so has Theresa
May.
This week you are a cherry
tree. After seeing your sister
tree cruelly felled before your
eyes [Ed. - Do trees have
eyes?], you are subjected to
a brutal murder at the hands
of some ‘surgeons’. You are
replaced with some weedy
twig that hasn’t got a chance
against drunk rugby boys.
This week you decide to go
and try one of the new pizza
bases at the union. Whilst
there, you discover a large
cherry wood carving of the
Union logo has been added
to the bar. You wonder where
they got the wood from.
This week you are faced with
the unenviable task of writing
the horoscopes (again). You
half-heartedly attempt to
come up with the usual
level of barely acceptable,
poorly formatted wackiness,
but eventually give up and
just paste in some actual
horoscopes. You struggle to
tell the difference.
This week you feel wonderful
and you’re looking great.
Expect to draw some
admiring glances! The only
downside to this is that you
feel stronger than you are.
Eat right, get enough rest,
and pace yourself. Look out
for trucks.
This week you read some
‘actual’ (we would say
‘legitimate’, but that would
be lying) horoscopes, and
decide, on a whim, to follow
their advice. You are hit by a
truck and die.
This week you are incensed by
what appears to, once again,
be a bunch of horoscopes
about writing horoscopes.
You see where this one is
going, and promptly stop
reading it. Sucks to be you,
the punchline is great.
This week,you’re an Oasis fan
and are furious at John Lewis
for butchering such a good
song. You decide to occupy
the library, but people keep
telling the librarians that
you’re playing your music too
loudly.
This week you are the new
big data observatory thingy
at the Data Science Institute.
Your computer brain is so
full of stuff. Numbers, words,
dates, figures, it’s all too
much. You decide to write
it down in a little notebook
instead but the cleaners
throw it away.

What is going on inside the
Blue Cube this week
What is: Blue3
?
It really shouldn’t need any introduction by
now, but just in case you’re still confused
(or don’t have time to read Blue3
due to
your highly demanding and vital workload),
we’rerunningaspecial,compulsorysession
for all staff members to explain what Blue3
is and how it’s here for you.
This session will also include a special
segment on how to submit content for
Blue3
, including an opportunity to enter
a competition to win a prestigious slot on
‘Provost Post of the Week’! (Non-Provosts
need not apply).
If you’re interested in any, all, or even none
of this (attendance is, after all, compulsory),
come along to the Boardroom at 1pm on
Monday.
Blue3
Launch Party
Ofcourse,whatre-launchofanypublication
would be complete without a delightful
launch party?
That’s right, we’re taking a few tips from
the premiere-thing that occured outside
our local concert hall the other week, and
hosting a no-holds-barred, black-tie, red-
carpet gala at the Blue Cube!
The theme is (naturally) ‘blue’, so make sure
you’re wearing something blue, or you may
have a visit from the Vice Provost (Dubious
Design Choices), who also deserves massive
thanks for his input into the redesign
process.
Don’t forget your yoga mats!
What’sOnoutsidetheBlue
Cube this week
We assume that everyone outside the Blue
Cube will be far too busy rejoicing at the
rebirth of Blue News to be doing anything
else, so as far as we’re concerned nothing of
any importance is going on out there.
If you do encounter any Cube outsiders
(although all staff members should be
reminded that it is College policy to
avoiding interacting with all students unless
absolutely necessary), please do encourage
them to pick up a copy of Blue3
, and to
educate themselves about all the vital work
we’ve been doing on their behalf. We may
not want to actually talk to them, but that
doesn’t mean they can’t hear all about our
wonderful lives anyway!
Alice Gast: Thought of the Week
“The Blue News of old was often about
addressing perception issues of the vital work
we do here in the Blue Cube, and some staff
members raised concerns with me that it was
simply acting as a bit of a propaganda for the
Faculty Building. Those staff are sadly no longer
with us, but I would like to wholeheartedly
encourage anyone with concerns to drop
me a line at our special complaints address,
disciplinaryproceedings@imperial.ac.uk.”
The weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building
Blue3
Provost Post of
the Week
Each week, we like to
provide the opportunity for
one of our Vice Provosts to
write a column on a topic of
their choice. Providing our
staff with the opportunity to
communicate to the masses
in such a highly respected
organ as Blue3
is key to our
continued commitment to
staff development here in the
Cube, which is why we’re very
proud to confirm that this
column – a popular feature
in the old Blue News – will be
continuing.
In a fond nod to those
columns of old, we had tried
to invite Al Pologies, the Vice
Provost (Arbitrary Excuses),
back for another pop at
the column, but when we
tried to send him an email
(a.pologies@imperial.ac.uk) we
discovered he’d been involved
in the latest staff reshuffle, and
had actually been promoted
to Vice President (Inadequate
Explanations).
In his new role he is
unfortunately far too busy to
be troubled with addressing
customers, I mean students,
and as such was regrettably
unable to provide us with a
column for this week.
Al has assured us (via his
PA) that he will certainly be
looking into his current policy
on interacting with the ‘plebs’
at some point in the near-to-
far future, and will probably
get back to us with some sort
of answer within the current
strategic plan.
Of course, Al’s hectic work
schedule (typical of the hard,
long hours carried out by all
of our benevolent leadership
team) does still leave us without
a column for this week.
Fortunately, these editors’
notes should have filled the
whole thing, so not to worry!
Next time, look out for a special
column from the Vice Provost
(Staff Management), Reese
Huffle!
Hello, hello, hello and welcome back to Blue News! Or, should I say, hello3
and welcome (for the first time) to Blue3
– that’s ‘Blue Cubed’, for all you
mathematically-challenged folks out there! – our all-new newsletter for
members of the Faculty Building.
That’s right, it’s out with the old and in with the new(s), as we’ve given our
beloved workhorse newsletter a fresh lick of paint (blue, naturally) and sent
it on its merry way into the big, wide world. We do hope you like what we’ve
done with the place – the lovely boys (and girl!) in Comms assured me that
Blue3
will look better than Blue News ever did, and should rightfully claim
pride of place in Imperial’s arsenal of wonderfully-designed publications
(except that rag Felix, of course).
Re-branding and re-vamping is of course something we are very much “all
about”, as the kids say here at Imperial. Our ability to continually reshape and
reform our appearance in the face of unyielding expectations is one of our
proudest assets, and has repeatedly proved essential to our survival. When
confronted with (unjustified) criticism, the capacity to change our appearance,
and thus change the conversation, is vital to our wonderful successes here at
Imperial, and I’m pleased as punch to include Blue3
in this fine tradition.
This redesign has been in the works for several months now, with a regrettable
delay in publication meaning we missed the start of the undergraduate
term (and thus the chance to introduce the wonderful sources of delicious
tuition fees to the vital work we do here in the Blue Cube!). However, the
lovely boys (and girl!) in Comms assured me at the time that this was due
to an unforeseeable issue with the espresso machine vastly restricting their
workflow. Understandable.
Nonetheless, this delay did give me a chance to discuss Blue3
with my good
friend Xi Jinping (the President of China, for the politically-challenged). When
I told him about our dream of communicating all the vital work we do to the
huddled masses, yearning to pay more tuition fees, Xi laughed heartily. “Alice,”
he said, “I admire your commitment to a state-run press. But why on earth do
you allow those filthy students to publish their own newspaper too?”
Always one to ask the important questions, is Xi. But when I asked the lovely
boys (and girl!) at Comms, they pointed out that we let the students publish
that rag Felix so we can print Blue3
in it for free. Sounds like a good enough
reason to me!
Have a happy, prosperous, wonderful and collaborative week!
