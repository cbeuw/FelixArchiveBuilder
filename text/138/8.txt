which U n i v e r s i t y men and women -have been
able to combine t h e i r e f f o r t s to help
where needs are greatest. While the
main emphasis has-been turned towards
long-turn undertakings to solve basic
problems i n South-East A s i a , the Far
East, and Kiddle-East, other projects
have been c a r r i e d out to help tackle
immediate s i t u a t i o n s of need i n these
regions as w e l l as in A f r i c a and Europe.

At the l a s t Union meeting a motion
was placed before the house asking
membejsaof the Union to r e j e c t l a s t
year's Council decision regarding the
d i s t r i b u t i o n of proceeds from any
charity c a r n i v a l run by I.C. The
Council's decision was that instead of
supporting W.U.S., I.C. students would
e s t a b l i s h a h o s p i t a l bed i n St.George's
Hospital, since i t was the general
opinion of the 20-odd members of Council
that W.U.S. was too nebulous i n form,
and i n s u f f i c i e n t information about i t s
a c t i v i t i e s was relayed back to the
College i n return f o r the e f f o r t s made
on i t s behalf.
The jseeposer, 3yd Lenssen, and hi3
supporters argued mainly along the lines
that the proposed 'support of the bed'
although pleasing and desirable was
short-sighted i n view of the other
worth while, more relevant and needy n
*
c h a r i t i e s which e x i s t . The motion was
passed by an enormous majority, leaving
u n t i l the next Union meeting the decision
as to where the money should go.
Obviously from the support received and
also because of p r i o r connections, W.U.S.
w i l l be a strong claimant f o r the proceeds.
F e l i x has therefore decided to give W.U.S.
an opportunity to c l a r i f y i t s p o s i t i o n and
p u b l i c i s e i t s a c t i v i t i e s .

IN HEED OF YOUR HELP?
For those interested i t i s hoped
to arrange a v i s i t by Dr. Kaloolm-
Iviitchell on Thursday 12th Uov. when
he w i l l give an address on the Work
and Aims of World U n i v e r s i t y Service,
Ample opportunity w i l l be allowed
f o r questions. I t i s a l s o hoped
that a f i l m on the work of '
A or Id
U n i v e r s i t y Service produced by the
American Co-operating Committee «ili
be shown.
W.U.S. PLUS I.C. = ?
I t i s obvious how u s e f u l a contribution
of approximately 5500 i s to any c h a r i t y .
In the case of World U n i v e r s i t y Service
t h i s money would be used i n a wide prog-
ramme both at home and abroad. Among
i t s a c t i v i t i e s i n this country W.U.S.
i s an a c t i v e and founding member of
the B r i t i s h Student T.B. Fund, i t runs
vaoational exchange course f o r about 30C
students annually, and has a r e v o l v i n g
loan fund. Abroad, problems on student
health,lodgings, education f a c i l i t i e s ,
and emergency a i d are tackled w i t h vigour
and enthusiasm.
A d e c i s i o n to reject W.U.S. i n
favour of some other body w i l l unfort-
unately be taken at home and abroad as
a vote of no.confidence i n our only
i n t e r n a t i o n a l u n i v e r s i t y organisation.
How w i l l a 'student who has been treated
or depends f o r his continued good health
on a W.U.S. Hospital, (not just a
h o s p i t a l bed) react on learning that
Imperial College has r e j e c t e d ' i t s res-
p o n s i b i l i t y . Such a d e c i s i o n oould
be reached by Union Meeting swayed by
the eloquence of a good speaker, indeed
i t was reached by Union C o u n c i l . This
decision should be made by you alone
and not be the r e s u l t of petty wrangles.
Balance the issue i n your mind, and l e t
Imperial College students help other
students to help themselves.
TO HELP THEMSELVES.
