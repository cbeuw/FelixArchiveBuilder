JAZZ CLUB
Eh* cry "Arc yon Blowing Jasawise?"
Is onoo again echoing round these
hallowed walls, and introduces
another Jazz year to the Imperial
Soilage.
Last year ,(under the jurisdiction
of f i r s t Dennis Leston, and then Gor-
don Pritchard)was one of the most
successful the Jtas olub has known,
a l l i t s various functions being well
attended. Jass appreciation i n the
©allege has oorreamondingly increased
After excellent talks,concerts,and
informal sessions throughout the year,
the higaspat was reached with the Jass
Hop, which featured the music of Al
FaixweaAher-Sandy Brown All-Stars,
they swung throughout^ to the delight
Of hundreds of dancers.However,some
salve idiot has since complained that
they never played a waits.
Weekly record recitals w i l l he
held again this year, featuring well
known jazs artists, critics,
intellectuals and illiterates. The
club i s also having Thursday evening
sessions, starting soon this term, tc
provide live rausic for listening and
dancing (admission w i l l be entirely
FHEB). At these, the tired science
student w i l l be able to proceed Jazs
wise until he reaches absolute
exhaustion.
MOTORING
The main activity of the
Guilds motor olub is at present
concentrated on preparing their 1902
James and Browne car Boanerges for
the Annual Vetorto oar club Brighton
run on November 1 st.
The engine has been re-
sleeved and i s not yet reinstalled
in the chassis and, same routine
maintenance has also to be done
before the run. As usual Bo will
be accompanied to Brighton by a
crowd of Gulldsmen who w i l l assemble
at Clerges Hotel for their annual
Brighton run dinner together with
the crew of Jezebel from R.C.S.
The run starts around 7.39
a.m. on the Sunday and competitors
expeot to reach Brighton around mid-
day. I f you oan summon up the
energy to see the oars off i n the
morning you w i l l be treated to a
memorable sight.
Rene Guerster, Guilds Rally
Secretary w i l l compete this week-end
(October 24th-25th) i n the inter-
varsity rally. Clerk of the oourse
for this i s Guilds motor olub captain
John Puttiok aided by several other
Guildsmen as me ratal a. This rally
is a tough 300 mile closed event over
some rough country i n Wales. For
those who want an easy introduction
to rallying, Guilds w i l l hold a
treasure hunt at the end of November;
a l l members of I.C. are welcome--^no
competition licence i a required.
The Freshars have provided
several talented maaioians, including
an excellent and much needed under-
graduate trumpet player. It i s
hoped that the club w i l l be able to
maintain one traditional and one
main stream outfit, besides two
existing small modern groups, and the
newly farmed Folk SohH group (the
word "skiffle" went out of fashion
long ago).
This year the club intends to
win a l l sections of the W.U.S. jaas
band competition, (last year the
traditional band cams second, on
normal form i t would have undoubtedly
won) and also to enter the inter
University competition, i f financially
possible.
Several lunch time Jazz concerts
w i l l be held this year - in the past,
these have been the only entertainment
to pack the concert, since Gypsy Rose
Lee did a complete strip there in
1910. Dennis Leston, visitor to
I.C. and ex-Jazz Club president, has
promised his personal appearance at
these concerts and at other jazz club
sessions, and meetings. Nothing
more need be said about this,
It seems likely that
oollege jazz groups w i l l once again
be in great demand to play at hops,
carnivals, formal balls, and so on.
This w i l l give playing members a
ahanoe to beat the carnival record
established by an eminent ex-president
who played swinging piano for 10
hours before eventually collapsing.

A strangely moving sight,|
seen several weeks ago, was John
Farnsworth entering College with an
ancient trombone. This completes
the formative stage of an experimental
group, consisting of bamboo flute,
bongos, trombone and man-hole cover;
Anyone far tennis?

It would appear that
the hostel furniture designers
have meet their match at last;
th. occupant of room Ko. has
had his bed replaced after only
one week i n resiaenoe. Me-
thinks that we have a future
Mr. I.Q.W.A. here.
The fact that the
present Mr. I.fi.W.A. has returned
his "constant companion" to the
custody of their President has
shattered a l l feminine hopes
that he i s standing for re-
election. It i s rumoured that
this may have some connection with
with the faot that a notioe has
appeared an his door stating
that "Ewart has lost a l l interest
in sex".
Congratulations to
Claire Broakea and Tony Oliver*
who, this summer, proved that
anything is possible under water
and are now engaged as a result.
What a bunch of "old

, Day i n the
Albert Hall; one ex—president
of U.L.Y and two ex-president*
of I.C. Union and two ex-
presidents R.C.S, Union, I
suppose they have to give these
D. I.C.'s to someone.
Residents returning to
the hostel i n the early hours of
the morning are warned to be on
(their guard against a feminine
i ghost that now walks between the
|second and the third floors of -
' the new hostel. Knocking only
once before entering the rooms,
this early morning speotre is
reported to carry a large cup of
tea i n the right hand.
What has happened this
term to the old club house, rest
home for 30 many has-beens, the
Union offioe? Our speoial
reporter states that Mrs. Robb
"has never had i t so good".
Proof has been obtained
at last that Chad, is persuing an
aoademic l i f e among other things.
A letter has been received from
Moscow University where Chad, is
finding l i f e a l i t t l e different
to I.C. - the trouble i s that
they have a nasty habit of
shooting ex-presidents.

Now. showing at the Plaza

Armstrong, a real must for a l l jazs
fan, whilst for those with.-naore
mundane tastes there i s a film star

ful Country. We hear Robert Mitchum
