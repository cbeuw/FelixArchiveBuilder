BILLIARDS & SNOOKER
The Club has started the 1959-
1960 session with no fewer than 60
members, whioh i s an increase of 5<j5
orer last year'a total, that i s most
surprising i s that two thirds of these
are freshers, whose relative merits the
Club i s attempting to establish by run-
ning a freshers' tournament.
For the f i r s t time i n the Club's
short history, a Club Night has been star-
ted rather tentatively with the object
of giving tuition to the beginners i n
the game, the tuition being given by the
members of the two teams.
The sessions matches have got off
to a good start, as both teams have won
their f i r s t matches. The A team whioh
comprised
1. D.H.miller. 2. A.J.Caves
3. P.Aliacn. i»K.M.Raja
won i t s match 3-1 against Regent Street
Polytechnic A team. The B teaa com-
prising
1. R.Wills. 2, A-Whltelook.
3. a.Jane. 4 . UPlmaingtcn.
won i t s match 3-1 against the same
club's B team.
The Club i s looking forward to a
session of increased activity but s t i l l
has d i f f i c u l t y i n finding teams against
which to play.
Can anyone help? I f so, please
contact the Secretary through the
Union rack.
FENCING

The fencing club has increased i t s m

m
b
-
ership this year and wo. are more confide-
nt i n being able to carry out a rather
ambitious fixture programme.The club
caters for fencers of a l l standards and
is running a large beginners clas3 this
year. Anyone interested: i n learning
would be very welcome and i s advised
to j^in: now, since catching up on beg-
inners excercises .is a very stiffening
process.Professional instruction is given
at the meetings held i n the gymnasium,
on Monday evenings at 5.00p.m. and
Thursdays at 1,15 p.m.
ICWSC
Squash
Under the able leadership of
Sheenagh Wallace the I.C.W.S.C.
registered i t s f i r s t victory with a
f i n * j'H win over U.C. last Wednes-
day.
Hookey
Despite the faot that the f i r s t
natch against King's ended i n a 4-8"
defeat for I.C. we are pleased to
announce that Hilary Tompsett has
regained her plaoe i n the University
Ist team, and that 1st year botanist
Christine Bragiel has been selected
to represent the 2nd team.
Netball
Although we have been lucky
snough to play several matohes i n
the Chelsea PSLy gym and despite the
fact that we have a promising team i t
is not encouraging to play in a gym
packed with opposition supporters.
So why not give some verbal assis-
tance at our next match (Nov. 23rd).
RUGBY
The Rugby olub i s finally
sorting players out to play the right
standard of rugby and a nucleus of
players have already developed i n
many of the teams. This i s a slow and
laborious job, however, for the officials
and i t has been hampered a great deal t
this season by the apparent increase in
the number of people who cross offtthe
team l i s t late . The teams are posted
up early i n the week , and there i s no
reason why anyone should leave i t to
after Thursday to cross off the l i s t .
Tuesdays and Thursdays
training session i n the Park have not
yet been well attended. We must have
people out to train as one must be
basically f i t to play the game well and
enjoy i t . (Training befoxwthe game,
beer after i t ) . It is imperative
therefore with the U.L.U. cup matches
commencing less than a fortnight hence,
that players must spend some time
together; in the park keeping f i t and
getting to know each others play.
The A fifteen have made what
must definately be described as a
promising start to the season. Having
now played 3 games i t had i t s f i r s t
defeat last Saturday at the hands of a
f a i r l y strong Chelsea Paly 1 s t XV.
On losing i t s stand off half five
minutes after the resumption for the
second half the remaining;fourteen men
(only three of whioh belonged to the
original team chosen) oould not hold on
to the five n i l lead i t had built up i n
the f i r s t half and was finally beaten by
a goal and a penalty goal to a goal
(8 points to 5). The previous week the
team drew 16 points a l l with Wasps "A"
at home and beet the N.P.L. "A" team on
their ground i n the f i r s t f a l l of rain
for many weeks. When the team thus
picked actually play together then the
"A" XV will be as good a side as a club
oould wish for.
One last request before
closing this report must be made to
those who s t i l l have 1.8. jerseys and
who are not playing rugby for I.C. this
season. Will a l l suoh people hand i n
their jerseys to any official Of the Club,
as we are s t i l l very short of jerseys.
ATHLETICS
On Wed. No 4th a t r i a l will be held
in the following events 100,220,440,880
and 1 mile in order to pick a team to
represent the College i s the University
Winter Relays Competition. Also incorp-
orated in this meeting will be the Field
Event competition for which the team has
been posted on the Athletic Club notioe
board (see Cross Country Club Board).
If anyone not chosen for the Field
Euents Competition would like a t r i a l
would he please inform me, K.W. Ludlam,
via the Union Rack before Nov 3rd.
The time and venae of the t r i a l
w i l l be posted on the Board as soon as
I can make the requisite arrangements.
The Winter Relay and Field Events
Competition will be held at 2.30 p.m.
on Wed. Nov. 11th at Motspur Park, In
the past I.C. have not been able to
produce their strongest team, with a
result that no success has been achieved
Can we, this year, produce this success?
SWIMMING
Despite the aawtaxtiott ef two
w*S» players,and last year's
Sougbborough Oollege captain,
1,0. performed disappointingly
In our f i r s t match of the season »
and were defeated by 9-4.Hr.
William MaoMlllan from Wogga?
Wegga,h*d obviously not reoevered
from his attack of bush fever,Baa ham
and Oorrigan wre daoidedly u n f i t ,
while the rest of the team although
trying hard,just could not click.
Goals for I.C, wears scored by Paris
(2),Rushton, and Wilson.
The seoond team, although they
defeated Chelsea, by 4-2, were also
8ias.pawdntlng.The most attractive
feature being the promising debut
of Canon,who i n addition to soaring
2 good goals,excelled in. the
midfield play.
On Wednesday IVth Ootober the Judo Club
had i t s f i r s t match of the season at
Sandhurst.We l o s t the.match 5-1 with one
draw.This i s not a very encouraging star
to the season,one main trouble was, as
usaal after the summer vacation, unfit-
ness. This w i l l perhaps spur the team td
get into fornr f or the next match.
Three I.C, men have secured places
in the U.L.team and aloo i n the South-
Eastern regi on .Fortunately none of the
matches will coincide with I.C. fixtures
so we should be able to f i e l d our f u l l
team for a l l matches.
During the summer vacation
three of the College Fireflys were taken
away to various open meetings. At the
National Firefly Championships, held thi
year at Plymouth, G.C.Taylor showed up
well sailing F.2168 Fiasco. He came
11th i n overall placing i n the
Sir Richard Fairey points Trophy.
Placed seoond i n the points Trophy and
11th i n the S i r Ralph Gore oup race was
J.M. Conway-Jones, an ex-commodore of the,
Imperial College Club. I.C. has yet
again retained i t s good name i n this
f i e l d of sport.
Our arrival back to college
was not, however, very heartening as we
found that someone had pulled the plug
out of the Welsh Harp reservoir.
British Waterways had i n fact
been running water into the Grand Union
Canal a l l summer and we were left with
a l o t of mud and very l i t t l e water.
Sailing i s possible on a
limited soale and several of our more
stalwart members, together with many
keen Freshers, have managed to launch
boats on most Wednesdays and week ends.
An instruction course i s being run and
team trials were held last Sunday, as a
result of which teams are now being
selected for our f i r s t match on the 7th
and 8th of November.
We would ask a l l interested
persons, be they Freshers or old l a g 3 ,
to bear with us during this d i f f i c u l t
time and assure you that with the return!
of the water we w i l l provide sailing and
racing for a l l who are keen. Meanwhile
maintainanoe work i s being carried out
on the boats and help would be
appreciated.
Small Ad.
700,000,000 gallons of water required.
Any suggestion.
