AFTER BEING DRENCHED WITH BEER AT
FRIDAY'S E.C.S. FRESHER'S DINNER GUILDS
PRESIDENT JOLYON NOTE LEFT THE
PROCEEDINGS IN DISGUST.
"I was furious" he said l a t e r
"not because I was wet although that
helped, but beoause Freshers were
seeing, at a formal dinner, behaviour
that should be reserved f o r the bar
where I enjoy i t as much as anyone"
Previous R.C.S. dinners had
presaged no such happenings, and at the
be<tinning t h i s one had been
pleasantly peaceful. President John
F o r s t e r handled interruptions to h i s
excellent opening speech with ease.
Professor B l a c k e t t , speaking next as a
special, nfimst of the R.C.S. Union,
received the a t t e n t i o n that a man as
great as he deserves.
Introducing the next guest
F o r s t e r s a i d " I am almost frightened to
hand you over to the next speaker -
gentlemen Mr. Dennis Leston......now
anything can happen".
It nearly d i d ! Lestcn at
ease i n a smoke laden concert h a l l was
now completely out of h i s depth and
deserved, and was perhaps playing f o r
the barracking he got. He ended a
d i s a p o i n t i n g speech w i t h an a l l u s i o n t o
his numerous immersions on previous
Morphy Days, i l l u s t r a t i n g the point by
drenching the occupants of a nearby
table with beer, aimed so w e l l i t might
have been rehearsed.
Perhaps r i s i n g t o Leston's
t a c i t " t h i s i s too d u l l " theme but
perhaps not pleased at having beer soaked
s u i t s , neighbouring R.C.S. men
r e t a l i a t e d , and i n the ensuing melee
Jolyon Nerve was caught by a spray of
beer, he l e f t disgusted.
Leston continued as before,
but was cut short by the R.C.S.
President whose own feelings on the
incident are best indicated by h i s
l a t e r apology t o Jolyon Nove.
He wrote: " I apologose on
behalf of the E.C.S. Union f a r the
regretable incident which lead to your
leaving our Freshers Dinner. I
admired your a c t i o n and endorse your
feelings on the subject of Freshers
Dinners.
Your expert handling of Guilds'
Dinners t h i s year has made them some of
the best i n recent years.
I would l i k e to add that, had
you been able t o stay, I'm sure that
your impression would have been
d i f f e r e n t . I would l i k e i t to be
known that Professor Blackett greatly
enjoyed h i s evening with the students.
COMMEMORATION
DAY
The Commemoration Day
ceremony held i n the A l b e r t H a l l
was l i t t l e d i f f e r e n t from i t s
predecessors. The event would be
far more popular i f some way of
speeding up the presentation of the
Associateship was evolved. As i t
was, by the time the Rector rose to
make his speech many of the audience
inoluding your correspondent were
already nodding s l e e p i l y i n t h e i r
seats.
The main theme of the
Rector's Report waa that "The College
i s i n a state of rude and vigorous
health". The t r u t h of t h i s i s man-
i f e s t around us. S i r P a t r i c k went
on o u t l i n i n g the many events of the
past year, a l l leading to one conc-
lusion - expansion, and l e f t h i s
audience with the impression that
they were to be the founder members
of something very b i g .
The special v i s i t o r t h i s
year was Lord Tfeeks. Sneaking at
I.C. f o r the seuond t i n s i n a f o r t -
night, t h i s gentleman of many d i s t -
i n c t i o n s delivered a speech which
contained a number of extremely
cogent ideas.
Unfortunately the d e l i v e r y was poor,,
no doubt contributed to by the
appaling acooustics i n the A l b e r t
Hall,-and d i d l i t t l e t o arouse his
audience from a somewhat somnolent
state, Indeed e a r l i e r on a
mention of Bo had brought f o r t h only
a merest p a t t e r i n g from the assembled
Guildsraen.

Lord weeks spoke at some
length about "leadership" p o i n t i n g
out that the s c i e n t i s t of to-day w i l l
most probably be the leader of t o
tomorrow, provided that he obtains
the breadth 01 i n t e r e s t and under-
standing that i s so necessary. "On
these aspects of a man hangs h i s
a b i l i t y t o secure the allegiance and
t r u s t of h i s f e l l o w men and women,
for the prime t e s t of leadership,
i s i n dealings w i t h people!.'
At t h i s point i t should be
noticed that among the many eminent
men r e c e i v i n g honorary fellowships
was S i r Lewis Casscn, many years ago
an engineering student at t h i s College
- a man who has t r u l y reached the
breadth of i n t e r e s t and understanding
mentioned, i n a multitude of f i e l d s .
Lord Weeks f i n i s h e d w i t h a
quotation from "A great headmaster
some f i f t y years ago" - one which we
would do w e l l to remember - .
" A l l I desire would be t h i s ;
that there should c o n t i n u a l l y go
f o r t h from t h i s College a steady
stream of young men and women,
d e s i r i n g i n perfect s i m p l i c i t y and
self-renunciation to do t h e i r work
for God and Queen and neighbour".
