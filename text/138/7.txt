GROSS COUNTRY
On. Wednesday 14th several members
of the elub took part i n a t r i a l for
the University College Belay at Parl-
iament H i l l Fields. This was combined
with a match against Borough Road Train-
ing College whioh we lost owing to the
over oenfidenoe of the eaptain who
nominated the last ten I.C. runners to
score against the f i r s t ten of Borough
Hoed.
The U.C. Relay proper took place on
the following Saturday the oourse being
6 x 1 i miles approx. The f i r s t team oame
second to Birmingham University with
Souihampton University a close third. The
second team did well to finish ninth
and the third team plodded along to take
up 18th place.
Two separate fixtures were held on
Wednesday the 21st. The second team went
down to our home oourse at Petersham to
aot as hosts to a team from Shoreditoh
Training College. The going was hard and
the times were fast, several members re-
cording personal best performances for
t he course. I.C. won with a score of
34 to Shoreditoh's 46. Well up i n the f i n -
al positions were I.Bennett (2), C.Huntley
(4), A.Bigg (5), C.James (6), P.Auton ( 7 ) .
The remainder of the Club travelled
to Mitcham for a mob match with Kings
College and L.S.E.This was also won, the
scores being 35, 45 and 141 respectively.
Notable performances were those of J.
Collins ?1}, M. Berber (2), D.Hammonds ( 4 ) ,
A..Brown ( 5 ) .
On Saturday 24th several members took
part i n the annual mob match—University
of London vs. Polytechnic Harrers over 5 i
miles at Parliament H i l l fields. This
was combined with the f i r s t of a namber
of forthcoming league matches arranged
among the London Colleges. Full results
for this match are not available at the
time of going to press. As before, the
going was fast and good times were
recorded.
LAWN TENNIS
The I.C. Tennis Club finished
last term having had i t s most success-
ful season i n recent years. It now rem-
ains dormant until the summer, except
for the usual series of ooaohing lessons
given' by Captain Rodgers at his courts
at Sydenham. Preparations are being made
however far a proposed tour to take place
next summer, i f the Union's finances
permit.
In contrast, the Constituent College
Clubs are buzzing with activity, under
their respective captains, I. C. Cameron,
(H.C.S.), A. Netheroott, (C. 4 6.), and
D. Zimmermann (R.S.M.). Kaon has an im-
pressive l i s t of fixtures against other
London colleges.
, The inter-oollege trophy, the
Brown Cap, i s this year being played
for -aider a new league system, i n whioh
saoh college plays each of the others
twice. Both R.C.S. and Mines hare
strong hopes of breaking the monopoly
which Guilds have had over this event
during the past dozen years.
TABLE TENNIS
Last seasea the table tennis
olub was moderately successful, under
the captaincy of "Chick1
' Brans, a
brilliant a l l round sportsman. There
are at present no officials of the club
John Ponsford and I are acting i n a
'caretaker1
capacity and we shall hold
elections very soon.
Practically a l l the first and
second team members left us, but we
think that among the Freshers w
e
*
- have
seen some promising players.
So far we have 50 members and
have entered 6 teams i n the U.L.T.T.
league. We hope to have a ladder, and
a knock out competition to encourage
members to get together.
From the enthusiasm shown by
oar members, we look forward to a very
successful season.
SQUASH
The olub was away to an early
start, and 15 ladder aea have already
played in representative matches. The
1st V started badly when they went to
Leicester University. Bans Espig and
Gef Bullock gave us a good start, both
quickly adapting their game to the fast
oourt. Fresher Dos Webb had the best
game of the afternoon, a l l his games
going to 10. He was unluoky not to
have the decision, reversed. Secretary
Peter Odell ran a long way but not
nearly far enough. Skipper Brian
Haywood forgot how to serve, and oame
in for some rough punishment because of
i t . Leicester have a new Union building
whioh is extremely spacious having
squash oourts on the ground *1oor.
Their numbers are Just over a thousand,
but this building would put ours i n the
shade. The oourt's speed was the same
is any internal oourt..........fast.
The 1st V has also won matches
against Kings, London (3-2) and Keeble
0aford'((5-0). The latter was notable
for the return of Brian Avient at
number one, and the convincing win of
Brian Jarman, ex-Cambridge man.
The 2nd V have a l o t of matches,
there w i l l be a report of them neat time.
Many members are s t i l l not f i t
enough (the skipper has been seen circuit
training).
Squash Club Evening.
Monday evening has been set
aside for the olub evening. No oourts
are bookable i n advance. Everyone i s
welcome. The following are the objects
of this evening*-
(1 ) For beginners to meet beginners.
(2) For beginners toleara the rudiments
of the game from 1st V players.
(3) For everyone to have a chance to
Say someone better than himself.
) For new members, i n order that they
have an evening on whioh they know they
w i l l be able to meet olub officials and
players.
Finally, I would like to say
that the squasn courts are definately
not cooing down this year or i n the near
future.
Members of the Boat Club in Training
BOAT CLUB
This year the Boat Club welcomes
over 40 freshers who are already learn-
ing their rowing from the beginning
under the tuitions of more experienced
students ( l ) Enthusiasm i s very high at
present, although punctuality oould be
improved, and i s always important. Nov-
ioe oarsmen should remember that i t take
time to do anything that i s worthwhile,
and to make a good oarsman takes a l o t
of patience as well.
A l l three colleges have Morphy and
Lowry crews training at 7«45 a.m. three
days per week, and the standard again
appears to be high. Great pains are
necessary to ensure that r i v a l crews do
not get too close together on the river
and Mines are sending out running spies
to report progress on the other two
boats. A slight majority of opinion fav
ours R.C.S. for the Morphy, but possibly
Guilds being the holders, w i l l have the
edge on the day.
After Morphy day, I.C. training
w i l l be uninterrupted, and there are
good prospects of five crews rowing i n
the summer term. Good news for fresh-
ers: i n the words of Captain Jerry
Caddy "No seat i n the f i r s t three boats
is safe."
BADMINTON
The club at the moment is suffering
greatly from lack of playing space.
However attempts are being made to secur«
the Concert Hall for club play and i f
these are successful the present over-
crowding of the gym oan be avoided.
To date three matches have been
played. The f i r s t team were unfortunat
not to win against U.C. cn the 14th Oct.
the result being U.C. 5 and I.C. 4.
Last Saturday both l s t and 2nd teams
had matches and unfortunately they coin-
cided with the Wimbledon Tournement in
whioh several of our better players were
taking part. However despite this draw-
back the l s t Team succeeded in beating
Q.M.C. away by 6-3 while the depleted
second team jjjust failed to secure
vistory against Goldsmiths by losing
5-4.
On paper therefore the results so
far do not look very encouraging.
