PROFILE
JOLYON NOVE
Perhaps you w i l l have seen
Jolyon Nave - t h i s years Fresident
of Guilds - making h i s rapid progress
about College on a ramshackle old
scooter. This machine would I am
sure, be able to describe i t s owner i n
a f a r more c o l o u r f u l manner than I can;
for i t bears several testimonials t o
his past career, one of them being a bras
plate inscribed with the name 'Mohammed
Kassan' - an Arab he ran down i n T r i p o l i
docks.
Jolyon a r r i v e d at I.C. two years ago,
having come v i a Oundle and the Army, and
his i n t e r e s t s were immediatley aroused by
the Engineering Society. Beginning as
a year rep. he then became the Visit's Sec.
He organised an excellent year of V i s i t s ;
culminating i n the Easter Trip to l a r i s
where 36 students were able to see some-
thing of the French industries etc
f o r an astoundingly low cost. He plays
Hockey f o r Guildford, and sometimes
v i l l a g e c r i c k e t , also took part i n org-
anising the Cabaret i n l a s t years Guild' 3
Carnival.
His a c t i v i t e s i n certain other f i e l d s
mist, perforce, be l e f t unsaid. However
bis a p p r e c i a t i o n f o r the good things i n
l i f e and his attachment"• f o r the charms
of the d i s t r i c t led^to h i s being forced
to occupy three d i f f e r e n t f l a t s i n
Unslow Gardens i n one year.
His year ended i n a three month
t r i p to Canada t o gain experience i n h i s
phosen Profession of C i v i l Engineering,
t h i s proved a huge success; enabling
him, among other things, to spend £150
in one short weekend. he i s quite
idamant about returning there as soon
»s possible.
I am sure you w i l l a l l j o i n with
Be i n wishing him the best of luck i n
the strenuous and, we hope, memorable
fear ahead of him.
COMMEMORATION BALL
Some 486 paying and a few non-
paying guests, danced tb the Music of
the Savoy Blue Room Orchestra, feta*
themselves on smoked salmon and fruit
salad, and drank the products of the
most 'U' Distilleries at Claridges on
Thursday last.
The B a l l was held i n what
Claridges designate as the painted
room, although f o r many a beady
I.C. eye i t eould be more aptly
named. ,
There were a noticeable numner
of newly self elected governors
who breaking a l l the corkage „aiterPf
of the house caused a worried water t o
remark " I don't know where i t comes
from".
The dancing although s t a r t i n g slowjy
became s p i r i t e d when the guests had
reached that deligate dynamic equilibrium
between sobriety and paralysis!. Most
Jhoughtthat the Orchestra was good a l -
though i t was c r i t i c i s e d f o r playing too
many slow p l a c i d quicksteps. However,
these suited everybody's dance s t y l e
e s p e c i a l l y when lethargy set i n about
1.30 a.m..
The dance f i n i s h e d at 2.30 a.m.with a
rousing. Auld Lang Syne, when people
went t h e i r various ways to the Hostel
for coffee, Covent Garden f o r breakfast
and some merely to sleep.
The evening was a'distinguished
success and served as a f i t t i n g ending
to Commemoration Day.
A l l thanks are due to the
Banqueting Staff of Claridges f o r a
most excellent evening.
PHOTOGRAPHIC
SOCIETY
Yet another success has
come the way of the photographic
society this year. It has just been
announced that Tony Ayoott has been
awarded the first prise in the FIRST
INTERNATIONAL STUDENT SALON of
Photography in Hong Kong, with his
print 5Joan". He is to be presented
with a cup, and the choice of a
Japanese camera or an electronic
flash unit and lightmeter.
This print was placed f i r s t
in the Society's own exhibition last
year, and was one of the panel of six
prints which won the European
Universities t i t l e for our society.
In the latter exhibition i t was one
of the five highly commended
individual prints.
Tony, who recently left
the College, has been one of the most
active members of the society for
several years, being the main stay
of the portrait group. Besides his
portrait work he has done most of
the stage photography for the L C D .
S. and L.U.D.S. over the past few
years, and has done quite a lot of
model and commercial photography.

OBITUARY
SIR H E N R Y T I Z Z A R D
Sir Henry Tizard spent thirteen
years between the wars and w e l l into
the second World War as Rector of
Imperial College, He was f a r think-
ing i n matters of education and as
early as 1935 developed a 3cheme f o r
the expansion of the College. The
B r i t i s h Government was not so science
conscious i n those days, however, and
i t was 20 year3 l a t e r that the present
expansion was adopted. The present
status of the College owes much to the
forethought of. S i r Henry, he was the
f i r s t Rector to have 'Big Ideas' f o r
the College, i n those y^ars when money
for academic expansion was extremely
scarce.
Although a prominent man, S i r
Henry Tizard would talk to and l i s t e n
to people of a l l sort3, sympathising
r i t h t h e i r views and using his w i t ,
for which he waa w e l l known, only to
humour and not to harm. There was
one exception, however, when r e f e r r i n g
to the attitude of the government t o -
wards science he was quite devastating,
and no doubt h i s c r i t i c s m has done much
to make the government more aware of the
v i t a l importance of science i n the
world to-day.
