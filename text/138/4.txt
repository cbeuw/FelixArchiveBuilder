Editorial comment)
The various Constituent
College Fresher's Dinners, always
help to enliven the beginning weeks
of the new session; the "old lags"
take the unsuspeoting Freshers to t
their f i r s t I.C. social occasion,
and bar sales reach an unprecedented
level. Following the dinner and a
after the inevitable speeches, the
main bulk of the undergraduates
retire to the bar, to quench their-
thirst and prepare for the singing
ahead. There i s always someone
in the three colleges whose repetoire
of "chamber" music i s both Ions and
varied, and with a body of exuberant
Freshers behind them the bar walls
soon begin to vibrate; the effects
of alcohol are well known, and this
week has shown that many of the men
of I.C. are not qns*«" the men they
thought they were.

And having not a single b u l l e t ,
He wept i n h i s despiar.
The tears streamed f a s t e r arid f a s t e r

The explorer picked up one frozen tear
And crammed i t into h i s gun.
Then aiming i t a t hi3 attacker
With h i s f i n g e r s a l l shaking i n dread

the i c e b u l l e t very soon melted
and the bear roared a c r y of pain
Ee shivered and sighed and then he died

Letters
to the Edito,
Dear S i r ,
I think i t i s time that
notice is brought to the members of
Imperial College Union that i n the
past few months many items of
equipment belonging to clubs and
s o c i e t i e s have disappeared without
trace -many from lockers, store-roomf
and oupboards.
'Whether t h i s i s a r e s u l t
of p l a i n s t e a l i n g or as a r e s u l t of
s e l f i s h and absent-minded "borrowing"
and f a i l u r e to return, the effect is
the same. I know of several s o c i e t i e s
who are f i n d i n g i t extremely d i f f i c u l t
to carry out t h e i r meetings and programmes
due to losses i n equipmenti
I t i s d i f f i c u l t to do any-
thing about the s t e a l i n g while the
"borrowing" without permission continues.
Let us a l l face up to our r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s
as members of our Union. Let us a l l search
our consciences and ask ourselves whether
or not we have borrowed something i n the
past few months and f a i l e d to return i t .
Many clubs are only too w i l l i n g to lend
out equipment f o r events connected with
the Union and the College i f proper per-
mission i s asked f o r and a d e f i n i t e pledge
Sor a time and place of return i s given.
Only when this s e l f i s h "borrowing"
has stopped can the Union as a whole 3et
about the more serious business of
"catching the t h i e f " , i f i n f a c t he
e x i s t s .
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

Dear Sir,
Even the I.C.W.A. lounge
is not exempt from the action of
irresponsible students.
A sherry party was held t
there by the Zoology department on
Monday 19th Ootober. Afterwards,
the aquarium was found to be in an
appalling condition - containing a
beer Bottle and a sherry bottle
(and smelling of beer) and the surface
oovered with fish food - the fish
did not live long.
This entails a thorough
cleaning out and restocking with
plants and fish, probably costing
about £10. My indignation need
hardly be expressed.
Perhaps the people
concerned would be good enough to
help remedy the results of their
foolishness the burden of whioh
should not f a l l entirely on I.C.W.A.
Yours sinoerely
Hilary Tompsett.
(President I.C.W.A.)
