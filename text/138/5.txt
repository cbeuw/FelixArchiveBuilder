square miles of the rugged country stretching]

There were, incidentally, nostalgic
memories in La Paz and many of the smaller
towns for our leader Dr. Geoffrey Bratt,
of Hobart, and myself. The clear, high*
altitude air carried a strong smell of
eucalyptus from"the thousands of gum trees
imported from Australia.

APOLABAMBA.
This was the land of the llama and
the alpaca, sturdy sheep-like animals
which roam i n nimble-footed flocks over
the mountains, p a r t l y domesticated by
semi-nomadic Indian f o r wool and meat.
One of the toughest climbs we tackled
was the 18,100 f t . east Soral leak. A
long approach to i t from our main food
dump entailed crossing the b i g Azucarni
g l a c i e r , criss-crossed with dangerous
crevasses.
Over the glacier, the four of us,
Geoff Bratt, John Jenkinson, Arthur Smith
and myself, set up out two tentsr on a
narrow ledge of rock high above the v a l l e y .
Opposite towered the south face of the
east Soral leak, with i c e f a l l s dropping
nearly v e r t i c a l l y from the cone-shaped
summit to the g l a c i e r below.
It was a f a r more forbidding prospect
than we had imagined, so the f o l l o w i n g
morning a reconnoitring party went out
to f i n d another approach. They were back
36 hours l a t e r , a f t e r weathering out a
d r i v i n g snow storm through the night, with
the news that the north-east side looked
a more l i k e l y prospect.
It was a strenuous march, with
eight day's food and f u e l f o r the stoves
on our backs. Climbing with 60 l b . loads
in the t h i n a i r at 17,000 f t . i s incredibly
hard work and any s l i g h t over-exertion
leaves one gasping f o r oxygen.
We camped under the east ridge that
night. Par away to the north, beyond
a c l u s t e r of blue lakes sparkling l i k e
jewels on a necklace, was the dark ereen
of the Amazon jungle.
Two reconnaissances decided us at
f i r s t on an approach from' the east ridge,
but t h i s was forestalled i n the last
1,000 f t . of the ridge by huge cracks i n
the ice and formidable overhanging cornices.
Next morning we t r i e d the more d i r e c t
route on the northern face which had
o r i g i n a l l y been rejected because we d i s t -
rusted the rotten, or loose, rock which
would have to be cros3ex$. We started
out i n the b i t i n g i y cold a i r just a f t e r
sun-up, aiming to climb a steep i c e
gully Reading to a narrow ridce about
1,000 yards short of the summit.
Roped together f o r safety we pushed,
slowly on, u n t i l i t became clear that
t h i s way, too, was soing to be a l i t t l e
d i f f i c u l t .
The only remaining a l t e r n a t i v e was
to climb the great 300 fit. rock face

d e l i c a t e work leading out up to 80 f t .
at a time on the strong nylon ropes
we had reached the top of the face undei
a projecting shelf of rook. Moving
c a r e f u l l y from there on alternate i c e
and rock, we reached the base of the
300 f t . c o n i c a l summit.
We stopped to put on crampons - en
sharp metal spikes strapped t o the
rubber sole of each boot - and, cutting,
occasional steps with the i c e axes,
moved up the l a s t few feet to the
summit. Around us was a g i g a n t i c
three-dimensional map of mountains,
g l a c i e r s and, f a r away to the north-
east, the jangle dabbled with a f t e r -
noon c? iud.
It was the moment that makes a l l
the hard work seem worthwhile, i n an
incomparable s e t t i n g and from a vantage
point nobody had ever attained before.
In these a l t i t u d e s large quantities
of p a r a f f i n were needed f o r cooking.
Ice has to be melted to water, and as
b o i l i n g point i s only between dG and 'JO
degrees Centigrade nothing cets cooked
very w e l l , p a r t i c u l a r l y the dehydrated
foods on which we were mainly l i v i n g .
The party rose early next morning
to be on the g l a c i e r before the sun had
started to soften the top crust and
a f t e r several hours' climbing we made
the ridge at the head of the glacier.
Prom there crampons had to be used::
on the hard ridge i c e a l l the way t o
the summit. The last 200 feet was s t i f
going on steep ioe dropping almost
straight down 3,000 f t . to the g l a c i e r
below, but we made the top by midday.
The return down the g l a c i e r proved
very t i r i n g a3 by now the top c r u s t of
frozen snow had melted and every few
steps we would break through and sink
down almost to our waists. So we
floundered rather than walked back
to the tents where a"billy"was soon
on f o r welcome drinks a l l round. Only
inside, away from the dazzling rays of
the sun, f-ould one discard the dark
goggles, without which, i n these
conditions, one would be quickly snow-
blinded.
Six weeks a f t e r leaving La l a z
we returned, bearded and i n c r e d i b l y
f i l t h y , to be given a wonderful
reception by the l o c a l Club Andino

both of which had given the expedition
a great deal of voluntary help r i g h t
