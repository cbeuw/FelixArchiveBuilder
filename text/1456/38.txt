Wordoku 1,456
Solution 1455
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters. Complete the puzzle and then
send the whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and
there’s a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate -
just solve it like normal and insert the letter that you
believe makes the word. And worth double.

P
eople have been comment-
ing, and I use the word ‘com-
menting’ in the loosest possi-
ble sense, that this is a poorly
written, badly spelt column. And you
would not be wrong. It’s not that I am
yet to master the art of the English lan-
guage. Oh no. I even got an A at GCSE
so that puts me well above the majority
of the scummy inbreds of greater Lon-
don. It’s mainly a fact of life- the fact
that I have no time and want to be in
one of two places. Firstly the lab. I like
my lab, I can hit a bit of metal in the
lab, often for no real reason. Secondly,
and by far my more preferred abode, I
want to be in the bar. The Union Bar
is always by some distance my first
choice.
So, ensuring that this section, which
nobody is really interested in anyway,
has no errors is very low on my list of
priorities. In fact I think it’s just fallen
off of the bottom. Let me check... yes
it has. So if you are still even a little bit
worried come down to felix and copy
edit for me, because I just can’t be
arsed anymore.
In other news apparently the day has
been made 1.38 microseconds shorter
after some shitting big earthquake in
some place that is a bit more fucked
than it was before (yeah, I can’t re-
member). Scientists, or those who call
themselves scientists, with an apparent
infinite amount of free time on their
hands calculated that the Earth has
shifted 8 cm on its axis.
If that is not the most useless piece
of information I’ve heard in a long
time, I’m happy to be stoned to death
by people using gravel. And not the big
chunks either. In the headline: ‘Earth
day negligibly shorter’ there is one
word of the four that I would tend to
focus on. That’ll be the word ‘negligi-
bly’. In it’s very nature it points towards
inconsequentiality and therefore me
not giving a shit.
Presumably some people were more
interested than I, and presumably
these people are not just mental, but a
bit lonely. If you are one of these delud-
ed individuals then I wish you the best
of luck with all the moral and social
struggles that life seems to be placing
upon you. Help can be found for you,
but just don’t ask me.
Having said all that, I have just rant-
ed for two columns about it...

Wordpath 1,456
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would
be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.

because it was too
hard? Anyhoo, the
