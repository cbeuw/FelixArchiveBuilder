Indie Rock Lads on Tour
It’s not all Kooks and Kaiser Chiefs, Kadhim Shubber and Lily Le check
out some of the bands the New Musical Express is backing this year,
and Lily reveals her experience of being a music insider

THE MACABEES
BOMBAY BICYCLE CLUB
THE BIG PINK
DRUMS
The NME are usually never correct.
Fortunately, the strength of this year’s
line-up was not one to be faulted.
Being the epitome of indie hipster,
there’s not much The Drums could
do wrong for an NME audience, but
there’s not too much that they did im-
pressively either. The highlight of their
set was a band member leaping around
maniacally with a tambourine.
Conclusion: they were a typical
support band and it was nice to
bask in that.
The crowd still was not moved by the
turbulence of the Big Pink and it was
a horrible experience to stand between
condemnations of “shit…get off!” when
you just want the slamming sounds to
coldly pierce into you and hack you to
a crumpled mess on the floor.
However it was lovely to find that
the standard act of going mental en-
sued once Bombay Bicycle Club were
adopted for cheek-pinching and “Look
how you’ve grown!” The grin stretched
across Steadman’s face was the sweet-
est thing as the audience refused to
stop endearingly scream-
ing the chorus of ‘Always
Been Like This’ - definitely a
moment that the band were less likely
to forget than the crowd.
At last, The Maccabees. They had
much to live up to after BBC and
did not disappoint. After pounding
through the main body of their set,
“legendary” Orange Juice’s Edwyn Col-
lins became a sixth member. Although,
I have to say I have no idea who he was,
I was simply waiting for the beaute of
‘Love You Better’ and trying to make
the most of Orlando’s pretty face be-
fore I could fight my way out of the
murderous asphyxiation.

Detroit Social Club have kept me up at
night, sweating a cold sweat because
I’ve come to realise that most indie
rock bands that I’ve liked for the last
ten years sound exactly the same and
really aren’t that good.
Their sparsely attended gig at Car-
go, as part of the Shockwaves NME
Awards Tour was the catalyst for this
epiphany. The band, all 6 of them, put
on a show which mainly resulted in me
noticing that I’d been standing on my
feet in the same spot for a long time
and that my feet were starting to hurt.
At times they captivated and struck
a perfect balance between rhythmic
prog rock and music that normal peo-
ple like to hear. When their more ex-
perimental side shone through I actu-
ally started to enjoy myself; 3 beers and
some indie littered with bongo drums
sure make for a good time.
But ultimately it never felt particu-
larly fresh. They didn’t take me some-
where that I hadn’t been already, and
if they had been mind-blowingly fun
I might have forgiven them, but apart
from the one guy who danced around
like a 4-year old (that’s a compliment
by the way) there wasn’t much excite-
ment going spare.
Which is what opened my eyes. De-
troit Social Club aren’t much better or
worse than most indie rock bands that
are hanging around today but unfor-
tunately they haven’t noticed that the
genre is old, tired and not interested
in doing anything but watching Coro-
nation Street and having a cuppa. But
then again, it was an NME Awards gig,
which probably should have lowered
my expectations. - Kadhim Shubber

THE NME AWARDS
Only dicks like the NME. Bigger dicks
go to the Awards Tour, the Awards, and
rip open the special edition box to read
about The Maccabees in Sainsbury’s
before realising it’s a pile of nonsensical
rubbish, and that they would prefer to
save their eyes for microscopes.
Despite the plethora of fantastic per-
formances such as Kasabian with Noel
Fielding and the Biff with Marina, the
rest of the ceremony felt contrived and
materialistic. Although it is about cel-
ebrating the hard work of artists and
good music, the general air seemed
more to be along the lines of “Look at
these pretty people who make sounds
and look at us who fooled you into lik-
ing them. We’re rich now, thanks.”
Plus, due to my absurdly poor mu-
sic taste, I have to admit the fact that
Jarvis Cocker, Paul Weller and The
Specials were in one room at the same
time didn’t phase me at all. Soz mate.
I apologise if you were hoping for a
review more like “OMG I saw Lily Al-
len in real life and she has MASSIVE
knockers”. I’m sure if you watch it on
the telly you can see everyone’s bits
thanks to the presence of the endless
numbers of skin tight trouser pieces
anyway. - Lily Le

I was excited about this gig, MEGA
excited. Girls’ debut album was some-
thing that I ignored for a long while,
and then disliked when I first listened
to it, but then finally fell in love with
harder than a victim of Stockholm Syn-
drome. For the entire month of January
I literally just sang the line “Laurrraaaa,
baby I’m right hereeeee” from their
song “Laura” in my head over and over
all day, every day. By now you should
have gotten the general idea; I was
MEGA excited.
It was packed out at Scala when I
arrived and after pushing my way to
a reasonable distance from the stage,
and trying my best not to stand in front
of some short angry girls I waited pa-
tiently for Girls to come out.
And then he randomly and silently
appeared. Lead singer Christopher
Owens, with all his girly hair and a
shadowing baseball cap crept onto the
stage to sort out his guitar and most
people didn’t even notice; the ones that
did just assumed that he was a roadie.
His unassuming demeanor thread-
ed into the rest of the gig. The band
opened with the afore-mentioned sin-
gle “Laura”, a choice which felt like get-
ting it out of the way so as not to keep
the audience waiting for it.
But as the gig went on, the word
‘unassuming’ began to be replaced
with ‘unimpressive’. The emotion was
all there, don’t get me wrong. Vocally
Owens sounded like a wounded wolf
and the simple power of the lyrics hit
home but honestly I kept thinking that
they sound a hell of a lot better on
record.
So when towards the end of the
gig, the other half of Girls, Chet “JR”
White, started joking that they should

In conclusion: all music awards are pointless, they always try to
appeal to the masses but this is not what music is about
have been nominated for an award in-
stead of The Big Pink (prompting some
of the audience to start shouting ob-
scenities in agreement - “Fuck Yeah!”
as always, a classic) I thought that even
though The Big Pink aren’t amazing,
they are fucking good live. Which I
probably wouldn’t say of Girls.
But then again, Girls’ songs are de-
signed for bedroom listening whenev-
er you’re feeling a bit self-pitying and
want to dream about suntans and bot-
tles of wine on the beach. It’s not the
kind of music that’ll inspire you to rock
out (although those ever-present 16-
year old indie prats that you find at all
gigs trying to mosh certaintly tried to
rock out; they failed). So if Girls want
to play a gig at my house then “Fuck
Yeah!”, but otherwise, I probably won’t
go see them again. - Kadhim Shubber
