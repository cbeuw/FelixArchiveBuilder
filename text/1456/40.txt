Cancer
[Ed. - There was some
repetitive joke about
having cancer, but
that’s just well out
of order. Whoever
wrote these this week
must have some sort disorder. A disorder that
makes you have to wear shoes specially tailored
for farm animals. You the kind, the ones with
trotters. This isn’t a personal jibe at all. No siree.
The Horoscopes just has a no-animal policy.]
Virgo
Poor dear Mike
Hunt got dealt the
ace of spades. You
Barclays banker, you
gave it to your hairy
bum when she was
on her George Michael. You go to the bath and
look for a bendy but everyone knows about
your spades. Yeah, you’re a failure. Get over
it. Even your mum doesn’t care. Because she’s
dead now. Nice.
Gemini
You discover “the
environment”
over the week
end. You decide
that you must
now dedicate
your life to its protection. You go to clean
birds that were covered in oil when a tanker
crashed. You stupidly convince yourself that
you’re making a difference. Well you are not
you deluded treetard.
Pisces
You’re alone in
your room, it’s late.
You’re bored and
horny - you haven’t
got any action in
weeks. You decide
to have a sneaky wank on chat roulette.
People keep skipping past you as you get busy
until suddenly you realise a girl has stopped.
You look at her closer and realise it is your
sister just as you climax. Sick.
Leo
No one gives a damn
about your stupid,
little life. You are a
huge twat! You walk
around thinking you’re
so clever, correcting
lecture notes from weeks ago. One day you’re
going to get stabbed because no one likes you. But
in the meantime, I hope that you get hit by a bus
and grossly disfigured. Though you do already
look pretty disfigured.
Aries
There was a man from
Ghent, who had a
penis so long it bent. It
was so much trouble
that he kept it double
and instead of coming
he went. That limerick was not written about you,
that’s for sure. When your girlfriend needed to use
a microscope so she could find it. Really it’s more
like the action-man smooth patch where it should
be. Honestly, have an operation or something.
Scorpio
“I see great events in
store for your future
young one, great things.
This week it is likely
that you will inherit
a great fortune from
a relative.” “So a relative of mine is going to die
then?” “Yes, and you will inherit wealth beyond
your wildest dreams - it will lead you to your love
as well.” “I don’t think I can inherit any money. I’m
an orphan who was adopted from the street.”
Libra
U R A FATTY.
This is a text you
received the other
night. How pleasant.
You hadn’t realised
that you were indeed
a fatty until you looked on the scalees and they
broke. Thanks oh so much for drawing that to
everyone’s attention, you know-it-all bitch.
Turns out your own mum sent that text.
Taurus
You go into your bank
to increase your over-
draft. The problem
is it’s nearly closing
time. You manage
to slide in just as
the doors are closing. Dammit - the clerks are
leaving as well!! And they lock the door behind
them. Suddenly a huge spider/human hybrid
leaps out from behind a cash machine. It rapes
you before drinking your sweet, sweet blood.
Capricorn
This week you
rekindle your love
for your favourite
children’s card game.
You challenge your
best friend but he
beats you by summoning a load of monsters
in one turn, even though this breaks the rules.
Oh my god, there’s a crocodile on your bed in a
K-hole, shite man. This is well weird. The only
solution is... Pint?
Aquarius
Wow, this lab report
is so boring, isn’t
it? The computer
is whirring
uncomfortably, as
though it’s in pain.
No, wait! Look to the side. The sounds of pain,
they weren’t from your computer, they were
from that strange couple who always have sex
in Physics. They decided to experiment with
bondage next to you. Good lord.

Sagittarius
You see a dinosaur
wandering the streets
of London. Maybe
befriending it would
be a good idea. You
take it home and it
proceeds to beg for money from you. Bam!
You’re now living on the streets, the dinosaur
keeps you on a leash. You’re its bitch. You have
to sell your body in order to keep it from eating
you. But it’s ok because you have a nice purse.
