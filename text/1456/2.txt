RSM vs Camborne:
Could the Miners
hold on to the
Bottle? organisers marshal every subsection of
Imperial’s art scene into a jam-packed
schedule of shows and workshops, al-
most all for free.
Artsfest2010 has happened as you
must all, no doubt, be aware, and
was declared an unqualified success.
The week-long extravaganza was
very highly publicised this year which
seemed to result in a much higher
awareness of the events on campus,
those eye-catching purple balloons
were a strong feature.
Monday kicked off with a philo-
sophical discussion at lunch and
a new twist on busking; a parade,
followed up in the evening with a
Jazz&Rock night and later a MusicT-
ech open session. These were even
more popular than they’ve been in
previous years due to the intense pub-
licity build-up. On Tuesday there was
a fabulous concert by the Sinfonietta
in the Main Entrance, and the evening
saw the opening of a joint exhibition
of Leosoc and Photosoc (and, in fact,
Knitsock contributed too) which ran
for the rest of the week, which was
highly praised by the gallery’s curator.
Wednesday, traditionally left free
for those who don’t get their kicks on
the playing field to enjoy a whole af-
ternoon of getting stuck into artistic
pursuits, was the fullest day. Not only
was there a double concert by Wind-
band and Classical Guitars at lunch-
time but also three simultaneous
workshops to choose from - Dram-
soc, Belly dancing or singing with Im-
perial’s popular a Capella male voice
choir, The Techtonics. To round off,
a barn Dance was held in the Union
Concert hall.
Thursday was reserved for the spec-
tacular showcase featuring acts of all
types but especially clubs who showed
off an extra twist to their traditional
repertoire like the string ensemble’s
video game-inspired music. Although
the Showcase was definitely a success,
it was deemed disappointing by or-
ganisers that fewer than 1000 people,
from the entire university, turned out
for the biggest arts’ event of the year.
Finally, with the week roaring to a
close, another joint lunchtime con-
cert of the string ensemble (who had
appeared naked in that morning’s fe-
lix) and Musical Theatre Society. The
evening ended with jamming and a
music Tech night in dBs and an Indie
disco.
Throughout the week, there was also
a developing collage for all students to
contribute to in the Sherfield building,
and busking and flash-performances
throughout campus. Contributors were
no doubt pleased, not only to raise the
profile of their enthusiasms and indeed
talents, and also to begin the end of
term concert season in style. The com-
ing weeks will see numerous concerts,
shows and even more workshops for an-
yone whose interest has been re-ignited.
Plans for Artsfest 2011 can now be-
gin in earnest; the Showcase is already
booked and elections for the committee
start next week. Everyone who wants to
form the next incarnation of the annual
event is encouraged to stand and the
outgoing committee is to be congratu-
lated on their prominent success.
