An Insider’s Haunt: Auckland

B
ut then, of course, he is best
known for his victory over
Napoleon at the Battle of
Trafalgar…”
Arthur Wellesley’s gaze
remained fixed upon his fellow Irish-
man. Not impressed. Having already
announced myself as an ‘unfortunate
inhabitant of London’ I felt the sense of
patriotic duty boiling up in my throat.
“It’s the Battle of Waterloo we’re on
about, Paddy.”
The stand-up paused. The would-
never-be comedian, who may as well as
have a parental advisory carved onto his
forehead cautioning extreme dullness,
uttered his funniest expression yet.
“Huh?”
“The battle the Duke of Wellington
won against Napoleon – that was Wa-
terloo, not Trafalgar.”
“Did I…what?”
Awkward silence. The crowd wait-
ed impatiently for a response while
Patrick their tour guide – or ‘Paddy’ as
I’d grown to love winding him up with
– worked on a riposte. Or, anticipated
my response.
And so I obliged him.
“Nelson’s statue is that way mate,” my
finger bore west.
The smugness earned me scorns from
the touristic do-gooders – leave him
be smart-ass, said their glares. Obliga-
torily, I piped down and settled upon
reading and giggling to the latest felix’s
horoscopes for the duration of the walk-
ing tour, since Paddy had learnt from the
cautionary tale and kept his facts right.
Now quit giving me that self-righteous
glower of yours. Wouldn’t you have done
the same?
Maybe I had too much arrogance in my
tone. But then, battered by gusts on the
Friday afternoon, expectations for my
favourite tour company running high,
I didn’t want to disappoint my shiver-
ing German friends. Already they were
rolling their eyes, with scathing reviews
brewing in their heads; tension flickered
Bizarre how just about everyone other
than JAFA’s – just another fucking Auck-
lander – treats Auckland with a certain
degree of hostility.
Fellow New Zealanders, who be-
stowed us with the nickname, dis-
regard our city as part of Kiwiland.
Tourists, fresh off the plane, find it
dull and lacking entertainment. In
our defence, we’ve hidden all the best
spots behind the grey façade that
is Queen Street, our so-called high
street.
Many visitors rush to the Sky Tower for
one of two reasons: to enjoy the stunning
views of Auckland city, or to leap off the
tower on a 192m bungy. It’s easy to substi-
tute both with radically cheaper options.
Visit Rangitoto Island, just off the coast
of the city, and climb up to the summit
of the dormant volcano to absorb a much
more gobsmacking panorama, free of
charge (ignoring the cost of the ferry, that
is). Although seemingly less daunting,
the Auckland Bridge bungy offers a true
freefall where the Sky Tower Jump can-
not – it has decelerators to prevent jump-
ers from slamming against the tower.
The lack of height is compensated with a
much lower price, tranquil sceneries for
the startled nerves, and an option to take
a dip in the sea.
Don’t be fooled by food retails – or lack
of – on Queens Street.
A short turn into one of its back alleys
would lead you straight into Auckland’s
gastronomic hub.
My personal favourite remains to be
Mezze Bar, Durham St East, which never
fails to disappoint with its unique Medi-
terranean flair.

as Paddy’s gaze met mine. By the time
he had finished depicting – actually,
more like squealing out – King Henry’s
founding of the Anglican Church, we’ve
already bailed and ending our escapade
in Piccadilly.
It’s funny how the mantle I’d once
despised – the slow-walking, camera-
flashing jokers standing between me
and my destination – is one I took up
when showing friends around Lwondon.
Not so much because it was part of the
hospitality package – more like the fact
that I’m largely unfamiliar with the city
I live in.
It was when my dad dragged me by the
ear around Soho I explored the area for
the first time.
It was when my housemate’s friends
needed to be shown around that I
stepped foot in V&A for the first time,
despite living pretty much next to it for
an entire year.
This is not me repenting for my verbal
sins – I just need to get out more.
