Catchphrase! 1,456
How to play:
The numbers at the side represent the size and
order of blocks in each column and row. There
must be at least one space between each block.
Then insert the numbers from the box in the top
left corner into the unshaded cells and proceed
as for a normal ‘Slitherlink’:
All numbered cells must be surrounded by the
corresponding number of edges. The solution
consists of one continuous line. Any cells without
a number can have any number of edges.
See last issue’s solution (right) for more help.
