Your Digital Footprint
Simon Worthington shows us that you’re still unique on the net
I
t’s a common misconception
that when you’re on the Internet,
you’re anonymous. Surfing along
happily not giving away any per-
sonal data, it’s hard to imagine how you
could be recognisable amongst the vast
sea of people browsing online. In fact,
your computer gives away a wealth of
information about you to every single
website you visit. For web developers,
this data can be invaluable in making
interesting, dynamic websites, but it
can also be used to build up a picture of
who you are and where you come from.
The first major source of this infor-
mation is your browser. The actual
data available varies from browser to
browser, but most of them transmit
your operating system, the resolu-
tion of your screen and what fonts
and plug-ins you have installed. This
might not seem like much, but in fact
it’s enough to differentiate a single
person from more than half a million
others. Panopticlick (http://panopti-
click.eff.org/), an experiment started
by the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
aims to see just how much information
you give away as you surf. Information
about your browser is collected and
compared to others they’ve already
seen, and how traceable you are online
is calculated. To the shock of many, it is
often the case that a user is completely
unique amongst the 640,000 or so en-
tries, being identifiable from browser
information alone.
All this would not be so bad, were it
not for the fact that websites can also
tell where you live. An IP address is a
unique number assigned to you when
you connect to the Internet through
your ISP. Web servers use your IP ad-
dress to route ‘packets’ or data from a
website to you, but websites can also
detect and use your IP address to find
out information about you. Using a
look-up service, your IP address can
tell a website your approximate loca-
tion, accurate to the town or village
you live in. In special cases like univer-
sities, this can be even more accurate.
For instance, anyone using a college
connection broadcasts that they are
connected at Imperial College Lon-
don. Location information can also be
gained using a relatively new technol-
ogy called the ‘Geolocation API’. Web-
sites can request location data from
the browser, which provides the exact
position of the user right down to the
actual street address they currently
inhabit. Although this information is
only meant to be sent if the user gives
their consent, with more and more lo-
cation-aware browsing, one day it may
be sent automatically.
Even though a lot of information is
provided to websites, up until now it
has been impossible to actually differ-
entiate between individual users of one
computer who browse a site. After all,
the computer looks and runs the same
no matter who is using it. The solution
to this came from a company called
Scout Analytics, who have used ‘typing
cadence’ to tell the difference between
individuals online. When you type,
you have a characteristic rhythm and
pace, characterised by the time taken
to move between keys and how long
you hold a key down for. Scout Analyt-
ics have developed a method to collect
these timings and have reported the
ability to detect individual users just
by the way they type in their username
and password. The algorithm has al-
ready been successfully used in a trial
to stop multiple users accessing expen-
sive online services for which only a
single license has been purchased.
For those of us who are now consid-
ering hanging up their keyboards for
good, there are a few things that can
increase your level of anonymity on-
line. The Panopticlick experiment has
shown that fonts and plug-ins are one
of the biggest differentiators between
browsers, so not installing custom
fonts or plug-ins will help you be less
unique. Another more drastic option is
to disable JavaScript in your browser,
which is how websites get most of their
information about you. Although it is
an easy way to reveal less about your-
self, most modern websites use JavaS-
cript in abundance and so you may find
many things stop working properly
when you make the change. Your final
chance is to browse through a proxy,
an online server that routes your entire
Internet traffic through itself to hide
your actual IP address from websites,
or make use of a privacy network called
TOR, of which more information on
which can be found at www.proxy.org
or www.torproject.org respectively.
T
his week we’ve got a veri-
table feast of articles for
you. From money-saving
tips from Ken Lo, to legal
absurdity from Italy by
Feroz Salam and why you’re not anon-
ymous whilst surfing by Simon Wor-
thington. Of course, we’ve also got the
Weekly Wrap-up with some gorgeous
cars, a Lord and an Apple.
But this week saw something I fun-
damentally disagree with: cutbacks
at the BBC in preparation for a Tory
government.
OK, cutbacks because of budget defi-
cits are one thing, unavoidable in times
of poor profits and economic instabil-
ity. But that’s just the thing, we’re talk-
ing about the BBC. It isn’t a company
hellbent on making profits, or one
that needs a steady consumer income
to support itself. It has the TV licence
fee to avoid that very problem, to pro-
vide content that would otherwise be
unfeasible if it had to make a profit. So
why is it that the BBC is making cuts to
its online presence and two of its dig-
ital radio stations, 6 Music and Asian
Network?
It all revolves around the highly likely
outcome of the General Election going
in a Conservative direction. It’s not a
secret that the Conservatives would
like to restructure and change the way
the BBC operates. Given their posi-
tion, the BBC is making pre-emptive
changes before it’s pushed. 25% of the
funding to the BBC website, one of the
most visited sites in Britain and argu-
ably one of the best sources of good
quality online journalism, is being cut
meaning that whole sections are going
to be lost. BBC 6 Music and Asian Net-
work are also to be cut, with the BBC
diverting the extra £600 million into its
existing programming.
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
March already? Blimey, this
year’s going quick. Speaking of
quick, this week had not one,
not two, but three eco-sports
cars featuring in the news. First
up, we had Tesla announcing a
partnership to make a special
edition TAG Heuer Roadster,
making yet another entry into
the ‘cars you wish you had the
money for’
list.
Porsche made its first entry
into the hybrid performance
car space this week with its 918
Spyder hybrid concept. It’s not
often you associate the terms
‘mpg’ and ‘gorgeous’, but, as
you can see for yourself, this
3.4L V8 combined electric
500bhp, 78mpg beauty has
it all. If you want to see more
of what could be Porsche’s
greatest piece of design, the
0-62 in 3.2 second beast can
be glimpsed at the Geneva
Motor Show this year.
The
third eco-sports car to hit the
news this week was from the
once-British Lotus. The 414E
Hybrid concept bolts a 1.2L
three-cylinder engine with
two independent electric mo-
tors for the rear wheels giving
the plug-in mean-machine a
300-mile combined range. The
combustion engine can run on
alcohol-based fuels or regular
petrol, whilst an external audio
system makes sure everyone
can hear you coming and not
silently creeping up on them
with battery alone.
Last but not the least on the
‘hybrid’ front, this week we had
an entry from Sanyo. Differing
from the Porsche and Lotus by
one important factor, that be-
ing the ‘traditional’ engine part
of the equation is you; the SL
Eneloop hybrid bike charges as
you pedal along the flat, free-
wheeling downhill and when
you brake to power an elec-
tric motor to haul your ass up
that massive hill. Yours for the
commute for $1800. Think I’ll
stick to the Tube, thanks.
We’re meant to be in ‘elec-
tion fever’ right now accord-
ing to the media. Can’t say I’m
feeling it, but if you just can’t
get enough of the Conserva-
tive Party, as the saying goes,
there’s an App
for that. Yes
that’s right,
David has his
own iPhone
App. Follow
the Conserva-
tive polices, up-to-the-minute
news and canvas your mates
into voting Tory with the ‘Call
a Friend’ feature. Nice.
In other smartphone news,
Blackberry users can finally get
the sweet, sweet nectar that is
the BBC iPlayer on their pock-
et pal of choice. Bold 2 and
Storm 2 wielders can down-
load the app and stream over
WiFi on any network or 3G on
Vodafone and 3.
Sir Clive Sinclair, the in-
venter of the ‘pocket’ calcula-
tor, the Sinclair ZX80 which
essentially created home com-
puting and the C5, an electric
car thing that, well, didn’t take
off, dropped a bomb this week
admitting that he doesn’t use a
computer. Yes that’s right, he
has his emails read to him. OK
Sir Clive, if that’s the way you
want to go.
It couldn’t be a week in the
tech industry without some
story to come out of Apple.
If it’s not about child labour,
it’s about Apple’s in-house
designed ARM chip, the A4.
Apparently, contrary to what
was first thought, the blazing
A4 isn’t a dual-core Cortex A9
chip, but a current generation
single-core A8 chip similar to
the iPhone 3GS’s, with several
components removed to save
power. Seems like less really
is more in this
case.

Bye-Bye

The BBC has put forward two sepa-
rate arguments for these cuts. The
first being that they need to focus on
quality rather than trying to cover eve-
rything. Now, I agree, quality is para-
mount. But if the BBC aren’t going to
try and cover a good variety of things,
especially the less popular but equally-
deserving sections of the news, then
who is? The point of a public broad-
caster is that it can cover things that
aren’t economically-viable.
The BBC website is a prime example
of a non-commercially viable resource
that provide a fantastic public serv-
ice. This argument also rolls into the
cuts made to digital radio. Whilst 6
Music and Asian Network don’t have
enormous followings (about 600k and
350k respectively), they are listened to
and are valued. If it were a commer-
cial radio station those listener num-
bers would be a failure of course, but
that’s the point, it’s not. Stations like
6 Music and Asian Network provide
a service to society and are one of the
only advantages DAB radio has to at-
tract consumers into jumping on the
digital radio band wagon. Why should
the public suffer just because commer-
cial alternatives aren’t doing well in
the economic downturn? Surely now
is not the time for cuts but the time to
bolster those public broadcast services
that the commercial sector just can’t
provide?
Of course the cuts hit the news this
week, from the mainstream media to
the technology press, causing an pub-
lic outcry of support for 6 Music. Al-
though 6 Music and Asian Network
are set to close by the end of 2011, the
BBC has admitted that they might re-
think the closures given enough sup-
port. Time for more Facebook/Twitter
grassroot campaigns, perhaps?
