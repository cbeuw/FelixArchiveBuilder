The UN keeps a force of peace keepers in the Democractic Republic of Congo.
The current plight of women in Congo
This year Imperial saw Gender Equal-
ity Day around campus, as part of the
Union’s One World Week. This admi-
rably focused on the position of women
in science, posing the rhetorical ques-
tion, “Does science have a gender?” In
so male dominated a field as science,
the position of women is rightly of
concern with a minority voice which
can be easily drowned out. It is some-
thing to be proud of that in our coun-
try, in our university, we believe in the
equality of women with men. But if
the cry for women’s rights must at
times fight to be heard even here,
in the Democratic Republic of
Congo it reaches barely a
strangled whisper
in the midst of
the deadliest
conflict since
World War Two,
which engulfs a shattered and for-
gotten nation.
In the grip of a vicious civil war, the
statistics on the region can be over-
whelming – 5 million have lost their
lives since 1998 and many millions
more have been displaced in a conflict
which is still ongoing. But one of the
greatest tragedies in the country has
been the intense, almost scientific as-
sault on the rights of
women and
girls. Rape has
become, quite
simply, a weap-
on of war; to date
over half a mil- lion
rapes have been perpetrated.
Today there will be 40 committed
in the South Kivu, in the east of the
country, alone: rapes which are carried
out in the most unimaginable of ways.
Women and children are left defence-
less as men flee their villages from at-
tacking rebel forces that enact a brutal
‘revenge’ on the people for the Congo-
lese Army’s increasing clamp down.
Left to the mercy of madmen, wom-
en and girls as young as nine can ex-
pect rape, often gang rape, from which
many will simply not survive.
Those who do, live less than enviable
lives. Survivors are sometimes kept as
sex slaves and young boys as child sol-
diers or slave labour in the country’s
lucrative diamond and uranium mines.
There have been 2,000 reported (not to
speak of the many more unreported)
cases of women being kept as domes-
tic and sex slaves for up to two years.
With utter disregard and disgust for
women, rebel forces have
become increasingly
violent with their
reprisals, resulting
in a horrific recent
trend and deliber-
ate form of ethnic
cleansing when the
rebels find a pregnant
woman. Taking bets
on the sex of the foe-
tus, they slice the
woman open, kill-
ing mother and
child, thus deciding
the winner.
This is, without doubt,
the world’s forgotten war.
The UN has called for
peace keeping troops
but has found coun-
tries unwilling to
contribute. The dis-
tance from one side
of the country to the other
is greater than the distance
from London to Moscow and
yet the country has just
20,000 UN troops leaving
the task of patrolling one
of the worst hit regions,
South Kivu, the equiva-
lent to a single police officer patrolling
Paris and Brussels combined.
The failure of the poorly trained UN
force is undeniable, with many of the
troops being accused of rape them-
selves. And yet when Ban Ki Moon
called on Europe to send its own
forces, we looked away. Without pro-
fessional, unbiased troops protecting
their villages, the Congolese women
simply don’t stand a chance.
Alongside the belief that women and
men are equals marches the belief in
equality of all human beings, every-
where. Trouble in the Middle East has
been enough to bring whole armies

pouring in and the undivided atten-
tion of the world, as well as many col-
umn inches in this paper. The last time
death on this scale appeared in the
world we were engaged in a war that
came close to being the end of us.
But this is not in the East or in our
backyard and we arrive at the acid
test of our belief in equality; will the
horrors committed against women
go unchecked, wherever they are
committed?

The UN in Congo
Over 20,000 uniformed UN
personnel are stationed in
Congo.
Current annual budget of
$1.35m.
The UN remains in Congo
due to the legacy of the war
(1998-2003) which killed at
least 4m people .
This
week
Lord Ashford admits
non-dom status
Lord Ashford, the Depu-
ty-Chair of the Conserva-
tive party, has admitted
that he is non-demiciled
for tax purposes in the
UK. This means that he
does not pay taxes on
money he earns over-
seas- the majority of his
income. When he was
made a Lord in 2000
he said he would “take
up residence in the UK”. Labour claims that he promised to
pay full UK tax. Lord Mandelson had called for a probe to be
taken into his actions, but these calls were rebuffed as the
relevant comission doesn’t have retrospective powers. Lord
Ashford is the single largest Tory donor.
Televised leaders
debates agreed on
The BBC has con-
ducted a survey of 49
councils which has
suggested possible job
cuts of 10%. The coun-
cils questioned employ
256,000 people. Pos-
sible areas for cuts in-
clude nurseries, road
workers and libraries.
While undoubtedly
savings need to be made in budgets everywhere, Labour have
said that efficiency improvements need to be made but serv-
ices don’t need to be cut. This is in contrast with the views of
the councils questioned, 70% of whom believe they need to
cut between 5 and 20% of their workforce. If all councils cut
10% of workers 180,000 would lose their jobs.
25,000 council jobs
are threatened
Gordon Brown, David
Cameron and Nick Clegg
have now agreed the de-
tails for the first ever tel-
evised debates between
the leaders of the major
parties. The debates will
happen as a series of 3
events. The first will fo-
cus on home affairs and
will be chaired by Alastair
Stewart of ITV. The second
will revolve around global
issues and will be hosted by Sky’s Adam Boulton. The final
debate will be chaired by David Dimbleby of the BBC and the
topic will be the economy. The live audience will be selected
to have a broad range of people and opinions.
1907, will take place on the 14th March
to raise awareness and vital funds for
women around the world who face
rights abuse (more information on-
line). For every pound raised, Tony
Blair (patron of the organising charity)
will personally donate another pound
so we can make a great difference.
Action is needed, every day delayed
plunges the women of the Congo fur-
ther into despair.
Equality and rights for all women,
wherever they are; that is the true be-
lief in One World.
