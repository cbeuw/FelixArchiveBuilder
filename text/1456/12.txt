Eighteen Nightmares
at the Lux
Eighteen Nightmares at the Lux blasted
away the Notting Hill Arts Club and Luke
Turner with serious force at their album
launch.
Get your kicks
from BBC radio
6 (music)
S
o you’ve probably heard, the
BBC have announced that
they will axe radio station, 6
Music. 6 Music is the only
gleaming beacon that shines
out through all the bullshit lowest-
common-denominator music of the
radio, just being able to tune in at any
time and know that I will hear songs
I’ve never heard before that I will fall in
love with, and songs of genres I didn’t
even know existed, makes me happy.
The day it goes off air will be a sad, sad,
day in radioland.
How awful will it be to wake up in
the afternoon on a Sunday, and not be
able to soothe your hang-over with the
deliciously cool voice of Jarvis Cocker
asking you if you have ever wondered
what it would sound like if Dr. Carl
Sagan and Dr. Stephen Hawking did
a song together? (The song, by the
way, called “A glorious dawn” is on
YouTube. Science has never sounded
so beautiful.)
Where else will you be able to listen
to a musical legend like Don Letts spin
mixes of reggae and punk rock? The
banter of Adam and Joe? Where else
will you be able to listen to the kind of
cosmic weirdness of Stuart Maconie’s
Freak Zone? Where else in the main-
stream media will you be able to hear
the kind of outsider DJs who would
never get on the Radio 1 essential
mix play 2 hour long mixes of what-
ever they like? And most depressingly,
think of all the little-known bands who
wont get to do live sessions because
they aren’t popular enough for Radio 1.
The money the BBC will save is go-
ing to go towards funding more TV
programs, but who watches TV any-
way when there’s iplayer?
Instead of cutting an interesting, ex-
perimental, really, really, good radio
station with shows presented by musi-
cal pioneers for people who really like
music, why not get rid of* that hideous
misogynistic fungus on the toe of hu-
manity, Chris Moyles? Yes, he is popu-
lar, but so are Coca-Cola and Kinder
Buenos, the truth is that people would
be healthier without them. Whoever
the big cheese of BBC radio is could re-
ally do something good for the nation’s
people by getting rid of Chris Moyles.
We may not be able to end world pov-
erty, conflicts in war zones, or the mass
destruction of our natural environ-
ment, but someone somewhere can get
rid of Chris Moyles. I can only imag-
ine the reason he hasn’t is some sort of
sadistic weirdo like that guy from the
film Seven.
While we’re there, get rid of Fearne
“I’m punk like Avril Lavigne” Cotton,
and Vernon “sort of guy you’d find at
Walkabout” Kay. Get rid of Russell
“look at me look at me look at me”
Brand.
*Ideally by transferring him to some sort of
witness protection secure compound where he
will spend the rest of his days watching re-run
marathons on Dave-ja-vu and eating micro-
dinners till he becomes mummified by his own
cholesterol.

Quirkyistheonlywordtodescribethisone.
Despite all lyrics being in French, what I did
understand was a little weird: ‘I saw a sheep
with three heads’ and ‘I would like to sleep
with you because your mother is too old’
.

ALBUM
Overrated. It’s not repulsive, but it’s
also not era-defining or groundbreak-
ing: it’s just alright. Most songs sound
like an electro re-rub of Taylor Swift
and for a former folk singer it is highly
disappointing lyric-wise. Although it
does get iPod worthy from track seven
onwards. Perhaps a grower? I mean I
did try to get into it by only listening to
it six times to write this review.
-Luke Turner
Gorillaz are pretty geeky, so you lot
should love this. This is so much better
than their slow-mo hip-trip-hop-pop
that they used to do. Don’t ignore this
song because you think Blur are crap
and these guys pretend they’re car-
toons. -Alex Ashford

With the recent emergence of the sun,
this song might even be acceptable!
With an incredibly infuriating whis-
tling dominating the chorus, you will
struggle to remove this song from your
brain. But it has that kind of happy,
summery vibe that makes up for the
lyrics being a little bit shit. Don’t re-
ally understand the biological title; she
just wants him to take off his skinny
jeans….. -Lily Le

The Bug do the roughest, dark-
est, grimiest, wobbliest dubstep. It
sounds a lot like a scene from a Brit-
ish film where someone gets stabbed
in a dark alley in South East London.
In short, it’s pretty good.

This is lo-fi surf that kind of sounds
like 60s girl groups too. If that doesn’t
sound like your thing, you won’t like
this band. I like the hand clapping and
harmonizing vocals. The more I lis-
ten to this the better it gets.

aybe burlesque rock,
maybe gypsy garage,
but definitely fuzza-
billy. Eighteen Night-
mares at the Lux kick
out a sound that would be surf rock
come poltergeist, that has some unfin-
ished business with rocking out, clear-
ly, and they’ve only just released their
EP, ‘Fuzz Candy’.
Being based in London, the four-
some have a sound of what their name
best describes, a fuzzing nightmare,
with surfer rhythms and tight progres-
sions. Having been played since 2007,
these boys have just had their album
launch at The Notting Hill Arts Club,
and are undoubtably at the tip of the
iceberg when it comes to spreading
their sounds far and wide.
This music is difficult to capture in
words but suits the image of a surfing
skeleton. It’s classic rock with fuzz, 60’s
garage without a leash, a blend of the
dark side to all things good, with that
burlesque charm, a surfing nightmare
and for that reason we love it.
The young London based quartet
rides out this music, with frontman
Shimmie keeping his calm and any
eyes transfixed as the vocals yell and
warn of sounds to come in burlesque
manner. As the fuzzabilly takes over
and raw bass thunders from Const’s

driving, crunching basslines forceful
in every way giving the sound its fuzz.
The rhythm brings the drive back a
step to the surfer beats of 60s garage
from Allen, giving a defining sound
to Eighteen Nightmares at the Lux.
Keeping the surf-rock alive through
the dynamic drumming, the guitar-
ing bridges the perfect gap between
the powerful fuzz and the rockabilly-
ness of the drumming. With vibrato
sounds and rumbling rhythms coming
from Greg’s guitar, sometimes ech-
oed in both parts, the spring reverb
and tremolo picking accompanied by
screeching solos with jangling riffs,
keeps the sound fresh. This arrange-
ment gets a dosing of deathly organ-
sounding keyboard for the eerieness,
particularly in ‘Ketchup Stains’, where
deathly laughs ring out before career-
ing into the chorus.
Eighteen Nightmares at the Lux re-
leased their chilling EP, ‘Fuzz Candy’
in February. Featuring said ‘Ketchup
Stains’, it also has the wild dog that is
‘Your Disaster’ and vibrato guitaring
from ‘Chick, Chase, Kick’. The EP feels
as though it is just dipping your toe
into Eighteen Nightmares, as though
it doesn’t give you enough, that’s the
idea of an EP I guess, leave you want-
ing more, which it does well.
Having blasted apart the Notting
Hill Arts Club with new and old mu-
sic, with help from the energy crazed
crowd, Eighteen Nightmares at the
Lux is not playground music, it’s a
surge of power, of fuzz and damn-
right frightening. - Luke Turner
