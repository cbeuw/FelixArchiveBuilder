Football: RSM 0 - 7 CSM
Netball: RSM 15 - 4 CSM
A
fter travelling down to Corn-
wall with hopes high following
a good season in the league,
the RSM were quickly brought
down to earth in a harsh fashion
by a very strong CSM side.
To be fair we were in the game for a good
two minutes but soon realised that this was a
different kettle of fish to ULU division 4.
Soon into the game centre back Jon, fresh
from consuming several gut fulls of rum, port
& fuck knows what on Friday night decided
to head their striker in the head. Broken nose.
Pool of blood. Brilliant start.
Jason made an early appearance and the
RSM reshuffled but soon felt the wrath of
CSMs left winger who slotted in after about
ten minutes. It was two soon after, when a de-
flected shot from outside the area beat our
goalkeeper Joe. CSM’s dominance continued
when it became 3-0 following a penalty
after Stuart hacked down their striker
who was certain to score.
Despite strong support from
the RSM crowd and Howard, it
was soon 4 and the flood gates
were opened. They were good
and despite Matt and Stuart
putting in the yards in the
middle of the pitch we were
pretty powerless. The tack-
ling ranged from industrial to
agricultural but the referee had left his cards
at home.
Then shortly before half time we made it
into their half. Jason’s shot hit the bar and it
bounced downwards but no goal was given.
I’ve heard reports that it was in (Bogdan) but
there was no russian linesman when we need-
ed one most. Still I couldn’t really see and I
wouldn’t like to speculate.
Anyway at halftime it was 4-0 and we were
staring down the barrel.
Jon bravely returned with his beak in bits
and Christian went for a tinny and a smoke.
Stuart turned to me in the middle and said
“Right Matt, let’s see who can get a yellow card
first.”
It became apparent however that this would
only be possible should GBH or perhaps some
minor stab wound be implemented.
Anyway I digress.
An early highlight of the second half was a
midfield tussle tripping over the ref but then
more misery continued through further CSM
scoring.
Joe gave away his 3rd penalty of the season
and it was five. Six and seven arrived shortly
after.
We didn’t really have a sniff to be honest and
they were a very good side.
After a decent season RSM sit 3rd in the
league table, whereby promotion is still
impossible
A
fter an 8 hour
bus journey
we finally ar-
rived in Penryn
College for the
first ever netball bottle match
(and indeed our first game
ever). We had been told that
the game was indoors, CSM’s
idea of this was an outdoor
court inside what can only be
described as a tent.
Needless to say it was freez-
ing. Despite this we started
warming up, trying hard to
ignore the 50 CSM players
on the other side of the court
(the majority of whom were
fairly large to be polite, wear-
ing skirts not visible to the
human eye).
The game started with RSM
taking the first centre. Solid
defence kept the ball out of
CSM’s attacking third for the
majority of the quarter and
after some unlucky shots and
determination RSM scored
the first goal.
After breaking the deadlock
we gained in confidence. Mc-
Nugget moved to Goal Attack
and shots started firing in
with CSM yet to even get past
their attacking third line.
By this point in the match
it was clear CSM were not
as hard to banter and abuse
as the RSM team, with their
Centre being reduced to tears
by the end of the second
quarter.
The rest of the match con-
tinued with RSM dominat-
ing. Despite some shocking
umpiring, RSM produced an
uncatchable lead. Intercep-
tions came all over the court
and the goals started mount-
ing up. CSM seemed to have
forgotten the basic rules of
netball and sent the largest
girls ever to grace a netball
court charging around the
pitch in an attempt to win the
ball. Skillful play from Rach
as Centre and some solid de-
fence meant that even with
dodgy umpires CSM couldn’t
catch up.
The game ended 15-4 to
RSM making the RSM team
undefeated Bottle Match
winners!
As agreed we were playing
for what was originally the
Ladies Rugby trophy which
CSM have managed to cheat
away from us for the last 2
years.
After our captain collected
the trophy and we started
celebrating something pretty
awful happened. The CSM
team jumped up onto the
benches and started doing a
song and dance.
The look of confusion and
horror on every RSMers face
was a picture. They obviously
thought we had enjoyed it
as at the presentation in the
evening we got a special re-
peat performance.
Well done to the RSM team
for a thoroughly deserved
win! Maybe CSM will be able
to put up a better fight next
year but this is highly doubt-
ful. Thanks must also go to
the brilliant support from
the RSM crowd, good game
everyone!
