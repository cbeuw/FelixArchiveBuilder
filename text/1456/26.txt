My ID card says that I am Sam Leveridge a 3rd
year physicist but in reality I am a full time radio DJ
at ICRadio – check out On Dancefloors live 8-9pm
Thursdays. Anyway, it’s unlikely you know any-
thing about being a student trustee let alone care.
The impression I get is that they watch over the big
sabb guys to make sure they do a good job. Look-
ing at the folks running for this, my advice to you
is that you are going to need someone like me in
those board meetings to make sure they don’t make
the union any worse then it currently is. Also, I live
with medics.
