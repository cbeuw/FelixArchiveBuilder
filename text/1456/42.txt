T
he RSM rugby squad
turned up to Pen-
ryn RFC on Saturday
morning after a good
long night’s sleep in
our caravans.
The weather and lack of prepa-
ration from Camborne meant that
the team turned up not knowing if
we would play on a muddy pitch or
a fake grass pitch.
Nevertheless the RSM stepped
out of their changing room to the
countless booing and jeering of the
crowd (a particular favourite sam-
ple of their eloquent banter would
be “ Number 14 I’m going to eye
gauge you and skull fuck you”).
The match got under way with
Camborne using their big for-
wards to provide a platform from
which to launch their backs.
There was some great tackling by
Ben Hanson on the wing and Dave
Blake stopped their progress from
the Camborne forwards. Soon af-
ter the RSM stepped their game up
and kept possession of the ball.
The team camped on Cam-
borne’s 22 for a 10 minute spell but
were unable to penetrate their de-
fence and found themselves going
backwards in the scrums.
At this stage the match remained
scoreless. A break from one of the
Camborne players set up an easy
penalty which they kicked to pro-
vide the local miners a three point
lead.
Showing no intimidation, the
RSM got straight back into the
game and came close to the oppo-
sitions try line, but unfortunately
the RSM had been struggling with
their lineouts all day and a loose
ball off a lineout found its way into
the hands of a Camborne miner
who broke away.
Freddie Chalke chased him
down for the tackle but the offload
found its way onto the Camborne
winger who scored.
A failed conversion left the visi-
tors trailing 8 – 0. The second
half was marked with very heavy
rainfall which made the slow pitch
even worse.
Unfortunately the weather suited
Camborne who from the go de-
cided that rugby was a game bet-
ter played with just 8 men and kept
the ball in the tight.
The RSM tried again and again
to break the Camborne backline
with some deep runs from centres
Rob Dowden and Fraser James but
the conditions of the pitch made it
hard to gather any pace.
Eventually tired from 75 minutes
of exhausting rugby the RSM mid-
field missed a tackle and their 12
broke away.
Fullback Max Joachim and wing
Blake closed him down but the
Camborne player managed to kick
the ball ahead and in the result-
ing footrace one of the Camborne
players got there first to ground
the ball for their second try.
A disappointing game of rugby
in more than unsuitable conditions
for a game of this magnitude.
Congratulations have to go to
Camborne who rarely do see the
bottle and commiserations to all
the RSM rugby players for a hard
fought match and giving it eve-
rything they had.
A special mention goes
to Ali Philpott who is
the living proof that
perseverance does
get you places.
Normality will be
restored next year,
however.

Men’s - RSM 1 - 5 CSM
E
veryone in the squad was wide
awake and more than fired up,
ready to avenge the loss of our tro-
phy, the Sharpley cup, to CSM last
year.
The match started well, with an unusually
fit RSM squad continually harassing the Cam-
bourne team, our defences strong marking
and forcing them to make mistakes and lose
possession. Likewise, we started strongly in
midfield, with several attacking breaks. Ten
minutes in this was rewarded when Nick
Jones on the right wing found himself with the
ball in space and was able to slot the ball in
behind the net.
CSM, however, countered strongly, and the
game remained fairly even for the rest of the
half. The RSM suffered a major setback when
a short-corner goal was disallowed and an im-
mediate CSM counter-attack blew through
the team before we were fully ready. The new-
ly determined CSM team pressed their advan-
tage home and despite some valiant efforts
the RSM were unable to stem the tide in the
second half. The end score of 5-1, however,
does not reflect the spirit shown by those on
the pitch, who played with the highest inten-
sity right to the final whistle. Both our most
experienced players, and those who had never
played hockey before this year put in brilliant
games and, although we came away disap-
pointed with the score, the RSM team should
still be proud of their performance.
Women’s - RSM 0 - 3 CSM
E
very member of the team was feel-
ing slightly nauseous as we arrived
at the pitch; we had never got such
a good team together and were feel-
ing positive yet terrified - Sammy
throwing up on the journey to the pitch due to
some odd illness that makes you cry. Thank-
fully due to the kindness of the opposition’s
captain we moved push back to 9.15.
During the match brilliant saves were made
by Sammy and her fellow defenders, with pure
dedication from the midfielders and forwards.
Unfortunately, despite holding extremely
well and being the better side in the first half,
our fitness and the unfortunate choice of ref-
erees by CSM meant we conceded 3 goals in
the second half. But regardless of the score the
game was thrilling to watch I’m sure and an
honour to play in. No bitterness is held over
the loss as we know we all played the best we
have ever done. It is just a feeling of disap-
pointment we are left with toward the Cam-
borne players, who continued to be dishonest
towards the spirit of the Bottle Match and in-
sist on playing Falmouth and Exeter players.
