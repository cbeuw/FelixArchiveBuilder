absolute waste

The Best Of “Overheard At Imperial”
Mate Says “Pint?”
What Will It Be?
Nothing gets the ladies on the floor like a rum and coke - with
a twist of rohypnol.
First Year Medic
Can’t drink. I’ve joined an AA group. In fairness, I don’t have a
problem with alcohol, it has a problem with me!
Third Year Physicist
Snakebite. It takes the edge off the piss they serve in the Union.
Second Year Chemist
We all know that nights out can get a bit messy and cleaning everything up in
the morning can be a right hassle. But is a mop to the crack really the answer?
A: So why did you break up with him?
B: He started humming that Tetris tune when we were in bed. Really creepy.
-Girls in the Library
A: Hey, did you know that Oriental people have straight pubes?
B: Wow! You’re not lying, are you?
C (“Oriental”): Ah, you babawians ah sow wascist!
-Biology Students
The new Union President is EDIBLE!
