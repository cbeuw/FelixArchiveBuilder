4 FELIX
I.C. COUNCIL MEETINGS
RECIPROCAL MEMBERSHIP WITH OTHER.STUDENT'S UNIONS.
A l l members of U.L.U. oan make use of certain
f a c i l i t i e s i n the twenty Unions listed under "Ins-
titutions having Recognised Teachers" In the U.L.U.
Diary, but i n return U.L. does not offer the use
of any f a c i l i t i e s i n i t s new Union Building to mem-
bers of these Unions - on the grounds that the
building i s already used by over 20,000 students.
Consequently I.C. i s to offer the use of dining
halls, lounges, reading rooms and the bar to members
of the 20 Unions concerned. I t i s f e l t that i t i s
unlikely that more than about a dozen students w i l l
avail themselves of this offer each year, but that
the offer i s a very worthwhile gesture in return
for the f a c i l i t i e s which are available to- a l l I.C.
students at other colleges and Universities.
Written application to the Hon. Secretary i s
required from any outside student wishing to use
I.C. Union, so that possible overcrowding on special
occasions, l i k e international match daye can be
avoided.
ROWING AND JUDO.
A launch i s to be purchased for the Boat Club.
This w i l l enable the coach to have the best poss-
ible chance of training his crew properlyv and will
surely be heartily welcomed by "Charles", who has
for many years cycled gallantly up and down the
tow-path keeping up with the fast I.C. eights.
New mats are to be purchased for the Judo Club.
They w i l l now "be able to start off in the New Un-
ion on the right foot.

W GYMNASIUM
The Cross Country and Boxing Clubs have asked
Council to make a firm ruling that the gymnasium
w i l l be used only for athletic purposes, since
dancing soon ruins a gym for i t s proper functions.
Council are strongly i n favour of this suggestion,
but certain problems' arise with regard to the run-
ning of hops. I t has been decided that the concert
hall w i l l have to be used in conjunction with the
third-floor dining-hall for hops in.the new Union
Building, but i t i s hoped that Ayrton Hall w i l l
s t i l l be available for some hops so that the new,
building w i l l not be subjected to top much wear
and tear in i t s f i r s t few years of existence.
It i s hoped that the floor of the. third-story
dining-hall w i l l be changed to wood strip. Present
plans are that this floor w i l l consist of pheno-
glazed wooden blocks, which i s not particularly
suitable for dancing. However there i s s t i l l time
to alter this, and i t i s the clear duty of the
Union Decorations Committee to do so. I t i s hoped
that there w i l l also be a suitable screen across
the room to hide the service counter from view
during social functions.
NOT* - Dramatic capers
The f i r s t production
in the new concert hall w i l l be a joint effort be-
tween I.C. Dramatic Society and the Comus Players.
EXPLORATION PROJECT
&a m a r g u e , s u m m e r 1 9 5 6
The most important-economic item i n the world
is food. Thus the food growing potential of &
country becomes one of the most important for
exploratory projects. Food both animal and
vegetable depends ultimately on the plant l i f e
of the area. The Camargue JSxpedition w i l l carry
out an ecological investigation of the flora
and fauna i n that locality.
La grande and petite Camargue i s a nature
reserve in the delta of the River Rhone in
Southern France. I t i s naturally dividod into
three regions, the coastal sand dunes, the f l a t
salty area covered by Salicomia grassland and
an inland forest area which has largely been re-
placed by farmland.
Along the river bank
i t s e l f , a f a i r l y rich
swampy forest has
developed. The area
has long been noted
for the bird popul-
ation and i n partic-
ular for the flaming-
oes which breed there.^
Wild horses and bullLvi
are bred there, the
l a t t e r for the b u l l -
fighting i n Aries.
The expedition
w i l l consist of four
botanists and seven
zoologists and w i l l
be i n the area for
about three weeks,
during August and the hottest part of the Camargian
Year. During the v i s i t many of the small lakes in the
area w i l l have dried up leaving a vast desolate sun-
baked area prior to the 'Mistral' winds which blow
for days on end and in particular during the latter
part of the year.
Although a l l members w i l l be Interested in
seeing as many of the birds as possible, the work of
the zoologists w i l l be more concerned with the i n -
sect fauna. A general botanical survey w i l l be made
prior to a study of the grasshoppers, xhe density of
population i n various regions i s to be studied in
relation to various ecological niches in the area
which are dependent on the climatic factors. While
the major work w i l l be a problem of this kind, the
team w i l l tackle any other suitable problem suggested
by the director of the Reserve. The botanists w i l l
concentrate on compiling a flora of the area, mapping
the vegetation, and carrying out a detailed investig-
ation of the habital requirements of selected
plants.
The expedition w i l l be
travelling by two Austin
taxis, the f i r s t . a pukka
1936 cabriolet and the sec-
ond now converted to a 15
cwt. pick-up. The former
w i l l be driven by D.G.
Hewitt with U.T. Tanton as
co-driver, and the latter
by Len Palmer with.U.B.
Sanderson co-driving.
The organisation of
the expedition has been
placed in the hands of a
general committee of a l l
nesbers of La Caaargue
Society with N.D. Jago
Hewott Vice-President, G.A. Uat-
hewg Secretary and L.E. Palmer Treasurer. The
various administrational duties have been delegated
to sub-committees of between two and four members.
as President, D.G.
