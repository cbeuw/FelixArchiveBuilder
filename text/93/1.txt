Beit Building Desecrated
Last Monday evening a banner was discovered hanging over
the main arch of the Beit Building. Firmly suspended, i t bore
the legend, "This Building is Condemned".
The danoing classes were being held as usual in the snack
bar at the time, and seemed to be oblivious of this event.
The person or persons responsible for this act of desec
ration is not known, but i t appears most likely to be the Flat
Earthist from Sir John Cass College who have onoe again beoome
active in opposing progress in scientific thought. Others
consider i t may be the work of members of the Union who feel
the building may be obsolete by the time i t is completed
The banner has bean oarefolly preserved and may soon be
transferred to a building in Imperial Institute Road where i t
would be more suitable.
