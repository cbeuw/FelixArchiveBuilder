All's Fair...?
Dear Andy,
President Bush has said that the war
against Iraq was fought for the 'liberation
of Kuwait', but what exactly does the
'liberation of Kuwait' actually mean? It
seems to me that Kuwait, was in part
'liberated' for the benefit of the people
living in Kuwait, so that, i n some sense, it
was not Kuwait but a group of people
that were 'liberated'. But which people?
Was it the Kuwaiti nationals who were
'liberated'? The Emir is imposing three
months of martial law on Kuwait
(presumably because, as according to the
Interior Minister, 'the cleansing of Kuwait
from the effects of war and from the fifth
columns'...will require some time' (my
italics) and Kuwaiti opposition groups are
forced to have a conference outside their
country, because such a conference is
forbidden under martial law. Already
members of the Kuwaiti opposition in
Kuwait have been assassinated and,
according to senior members of the
opposition, the Planning Minister had said
that Syria's disbanded Special Forces
were being recruited by a young Sabah
to 'eliminate opposition'. Indeed, Kuwaitis
seem to have m o r e liberty here in Britain
than they do in their o w n country.
Was it the people w h o w o r k e d in
Kuwait w h o were 'liberated'? The
Washington based Centre of Policy
Analysis on Palestine has already called
for measures to prevent retaliation
against Palestinians living in Kuwait,
people w h o have contributed more to the
growth of Kuwait than the Kuwaitis
themselves. One of the reasons for the
Centre's concern is that the C r o w n Prince
Sheikh Sa'ad as-Sabah himself had said
that they will begin checking up on the
Palestinians and non-Palestinians who
might have been in the 'fifth column'
(certainly any 'retaliations' on the
Palestinians carried out by the state
would be m u c h easier under martial law).
So it does not seem likely that the war
was fought for the large group of non-
Kuwaitis living in Kuwait.
Was the war, in some twisted way,
fought for the 'liberation' of (he Iraqi
people? Liberty in Iraq was not taken
very seriously by the US w h e n for over
twenty years it allowed, supported and
probably helped set up the brutal Ba'ath
regime, a regime w h i c h imprisoned,
tortured and killed thousands of innocent
Arabs and Kurds in Iraq. A n d the
thousands of people who are not trapped
in rubble, who are suffering from disease,
and who are being operated on without
anaesthetic because their country has
been 'bombed back into the stone-age',
can hardly feel 'liberated'. The Iraqi
conscripts, who probably never wanted
the war and were bombed even while
retreating because they were a 'threat'
could hardly have felt that they are being
'liberated', a n d now that the US, a
country w h i c h has imposed many
dictatorships across the world, is poised
to impose yet another dictatorship on
Iraq, it seems v e r y unlikely that the war
was fought for the 'liberation' of the Iraqi
people.
The Kuwaiti nationals have not gained
as m u c h 'liberation' as they would have
liked, nor have the non-Kuwaitis in
Kuwait, and certainly not the people of
Iraq. W h o then, was 'liberated' in this
war? Well for a start there is the ruling
family of Kuwait, Israel hasn't done too
badly, and the US has certainly made
gains in this war. The war was fought so
that the Sabah family could have the
freedom to exploit the people in Kuwait
and to make mind-numbingly large
amounts of money, so that Israel no
longer had to deal with the 'threat' of
Iraq, and now that it is once again the
strongest state in the Middle East, could
take extra 'liberty' in suppressing the
Palestinian 'threat', and last and by no
means least, so that the ruling powers of
the US could have the freedom to exploit
the Middle East.
I fully condemn the invasion of Kuwait
by Saddam, and whatever legitimate
rights Iraq has to Kuwait, invasion and
slaughter of innocent people by a dictator
is wrong. But I would lie to make an
even stronger condemnation of the US for
encouraging Kuwait to 'stand firm' and
not to negotiate with Iraq on the
economic problems and border disputes
which led to the invasion, while at the
same time giving a 'green light' to
Saddam to invade Kuwait, thereby giving
a pretext for the US to destory Iraq.
