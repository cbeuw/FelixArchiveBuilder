Do you prefer boxer shorts or y-fronts and are you
going to vote in the sabbatical elections?
Kerry:
•Y-fronts are a real turn-off—they're
bulgy, horrible and very unsexy.
• W h a t ' s a sabbatical?
Sarah:
• Boxer shorts—you can get at it more
easily.
• W h a t elections?
• Boxer shorts, because y-fronts look like
sausages in a sac—all lumpy and squidgy.
• W h a t sabbatical elections?

Oily:
• Prefer boxer shorts for looks and
comfort although at times they can be
uncomfortable.

to do with the Union aren't they?
Jez:
• Boxer shorts; paisley y-fronts would
look stupid wouldn't they?
• W h a t are sabbaticals? W h i c h elections?
W h e r e is IC? W h o a m I?
Mike:
• Boxer shorts because they give the
freedom that one requires...unrestricted
access (can get your hand down your
'cacks' without too m u c h hassle).
• No I'm not going to vote because I
have no arms!?!
