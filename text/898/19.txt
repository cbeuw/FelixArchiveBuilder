Dear Andy,
Last Friday's C & G Dinner and Dance
cost £85 per double ticket. Approximately
150 couples attended. W h y not hold the
event elsewhere and let the ticket price
include a contribution to charity? I a m
sure that the 53,000 or £4,000 raised
could go to a v e r y worthy cause, such as
feeding those w h o were starving under
railway bridges, while the young turks of
City and Guilds College were stuffing
their faces?
It could be argued that this event was
the students' big splash of the year.
Somehow though, I think these would-be
captains of industry are aspiring to hold
their company functions at the Hilton or
Ritz in twenty years time. Once again,
the cost of a three-course dinner will be
higher than the average waitresses
weekly take-home pay.
John Major's classless society may be
changing but at Imperial, the Imperialist
ethos lives on.
