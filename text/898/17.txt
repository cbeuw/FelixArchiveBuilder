But By Jingo...
Dear Andy,
There has been a lot of controversy
over whether our brave and valiant
heroes from the Gulf should receive a
victory parade when they return. I think
they should. Those who complain are the
same bunch of pacifist lefties and general
no-hopers w h o can't wait to knock our
country at every opportunity.
There were times, during the war, that
those of us at home could only watch and
pray that our casualties w o u l d be light,
and thank goodness they were! W e were
struck from the start by the bravery of
our pilots returning from their raids over
Baghdad. So calm, so professional, so
British. Our hearts went out to those
families whose sons, daughters or loved
ones will never return.
And what now? Before the war we
were urged to plunge even deeper into
Europe and turn our backs on our
A m e r i c a n friends. W h e n the chips were
d o w n our European 'friends' collapsed.
W e British did not bottle out because our
actions are not guided by national
interest as by our national character. In
the 2nd W o r l d W a r we took on Hitler to
defend the rights of weaker countries as
we have done in the Gulf. W e also
Sad But True
showed that jumped up Argie dictator
Galtieri that w e would stand firm on the
Falklands. It just wouldn't have seemed
right to sit back and let the Yanks fight
alone. This historic alliance of the Union
Jack and the Stars and Stripes has been
forged in the blood of our heroes.
W e must never forget those who lost
their lives fighting for this country in any
battle or war. T h e victory parade will
provide an end to this latest chapter
w h i c h is important for the troops. It will
show how proud of the Boys we really
are and how proud we are in our great
country. Ignore all these lefties who say
belief in the Union flag is wrong. It is not!
I will probably be called jingoistic for
writing this letter. Jingoism comes from
the following 19th century poem:
W e don't want to fight,
But by Jingo if we do,
We've got the ships,
We've got the m e n ,
We've got the money too.
And what the hell is w r o n g in that?
The very best of British,
Alan Bailey (newly elected SCC Political
Rep).
P.S. When's the debate?
Dear Andy,
You are probably reading this letter
during a lecture—why not I wrote it
during one? Lectures round here seem to
fall into two categories; those you can
sleep in and those in w h i c h y o u practise
your handwriting. W e are constantly
faced with being slowly lulled to sleep by
the never ending voice of some professor,
talking about notes he has already
distributed in printed form; followed by a
session of furiously copying the
blackboard to save Imperial's
photocopiers—never understanding, just
copying. I could have collected notes and
copied the board when I was six; only
better then as I wasn't short-sighted.
I only had one really good teacher at
school,- but he knew his job so well that
he made all our other teachers look
extremely poor. In his lessons at least
80% of what was said came from pupils;
this way he could get a large amount of
feedback on how m u c h the class
understood and what speed to go.
Everything w o u l d be covered twice in a
lesson. First time he would just let
anybody in the class suggest how to
proceed, the other time he w o u l d pick on
individuals, m o v i n g around every so
often. His choice of material was
excellent, just too difficult for any one
person to do, but the whole class could
manage, and the combination of
contributing and being picked on kept
everyone interested.
The problem with lecturers here in Elec
Eng is that the student is just a passive
observer, the lecturer has no way of
k n o w i n g how m u c h has been understood.
It is easier to sit back and daydream than
it is to concentrate and people will
normally opt for the easiest thing to do.
