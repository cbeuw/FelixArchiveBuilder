Democracy Time
Elections
By now, elections are upon us. I wish all
candidates good luck—may the best
m a n / w o m a n win.
Welfare
Last week's welfare campaign was a
storming success. M y thanks to everyone
w h o helped—especially Riverside w h o
provided the materials and expertise for
the health fair.
Accommodati on
The sale of Montpelier has been put o n
ice for a further month pending legal
technicalities. It is becoming increasingly
clear that the purchase of Clayponds
could prove to be one of the costliest
errors the College has ever made. Whilst
the bedstock has increased b y 400 places,
so has the residence deficit. I sincerely
hope that w h e n rent levels are set in
April, students are not asked to bail out
College for mistakes made b y ex-
employees and senior officials covering
their o w n backs.
Transport
V a n insurance is n o w being handled b y
Endsleigh. A l l drivers are required to fill
in a van drivers' questionnaire. Please see
Michelle in the Union Office if you
haven't already received o n e v i a your
club/society.
How to Vote
At Imperial w e operate a system called
Single Transferable Vote.
Candidates are listed in alphabetical
order o n the ballot slips. O n e slip per
post.
Y o u place a '1' against the candidate of
your first preference; a '2' for the second
and continue up to the number of
candidates including N e w Election. Y o u
must start the sequence w i t h a '1', no
number can appear more than once, it
must be consecutive and no other mark
can appear o n the paper (marks include
ticks and crosses). Y o u can transfer your
vote to as m a n y or as few candidates as
you wish.
Voting takes place in each department
plus c o m m o n areas and are identified b y
a ballot b o x and a person manning it.
W h e n you go to vote you will need to
produce your Union card which will be
punched. Y o u will be given your voting
slips plus a slip w e are using to determine
who is voting. If you do put other marks
on the paper, it will not be included in
the count, so please ask for a
replacement form from the person
manning the b o x .
Please vote as your vote counts and it
is your Union.

1. Finance
Union Finance Committee has deliberated
over next year's budget. I might bring
this budget to the forthcoming U G M , so
that w e can all see what our money will
be spent o n .
2. Security & Events
Last Friday's International Night proved
to be so popular that difficulties in
organisation and security were
experienced. This all adds further weight
to m y previous arguments that ICU

requires an Events Manager, to
coordinate events and introduce ongoing
advice and professionalism to add to the
enthusiasm of the student groups that
organise the events.
3. Promotions
Something else that an Events Manager
could get their teeth into; the Union n o w
has loads of potential for a greatly
increased Ents programme, w e just need
the ideas for promotions and forms of
advertising—got any suggestions, come
into the Union Office and talk to Mandy
Hurford (Union Manager) o r myself.
4. Academic Affairs
The A c a d e m i c Affairs Half-Day was a
reasonable success, with about thirty
student academic representatives turning
up to discuss topical issues, and to listen
to some of the Rector's views o n these.
5. Developments
What do you think w e could do to the
JCR to turn it into a place that the
average student identifies as being part of
the Union, a r o o m that any student group
can book out for functions, discos, etc?
6. Interviewing for Union Staff
Been involved in lots of these, with more
to come.
