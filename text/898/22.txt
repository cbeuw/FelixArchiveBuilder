Editorial
It's been a bit of an interesting week. T h e
ICU Hustings at St Mary's was, b y all
accounts, something of an event. A s 1
write the 'in house' hustings are taking
place i n the JCR. M y life has been fraught
with disasters, culminating i n a rather
sever (as anyone there could tell you)
drinking session last night, i n w h i c h I
made full use of the midnight bar
extension. Thankfully I'm feeling m u c h
better today, mainly due to some serious
thinking at about 4.00 a m this morning.
There have also been some rather
wonderful things going o n that have
come to m y attention...
Bankers. Big, stupid, ugly bankers
Here's a bit of fun. See if y o u can work
out the bank's reasoning i n the following
situation: A student at Imperial has two
overdrafts. One is with Natwest (the
branch i n college), and one w i t h Barclays
(his home branch). Both of the overdrafts
are large (the Barclays o n e just under
£2000, the Natwest roughly twice that).
The student gets a full grant, his parent
cannot afford to give him any more
money, and has no savings or income of
any other kind, other than that w h i c h he
earns by w o r k i n g during term time or
holidays (although holidays are something
of a problem, as he lives i n the country,
and doesn't drive).
With debts of this size he realises that
he really should be a good b o y and not
make them any larger. Thus, being an
optimistic type, he decides to live o n his
grant (ho, ho, ho). A t this point i n the
year he's not doing so badly. H e hasn't
used his bank accounts at all, and has
sent a letter to both banks, explaining
that he has thrown his cheque-book
away, and will be paying back as m u c h
as he can over the summer. Seem fair
enough?
Then, i n their infinite w i s d o m (?),
Barclays decide to ask the student for
their money. Only they do it b y sending
him a court summons. So the student
rings the bank, to explain the situation.
Then, guess what? The bank says 'It's out
of our hands, you'll have to speak to the
solicitors'. So the student rings the
solicitors, and explains the situation (ie he
has no money). Guess What? T h e
solicitors say 'There's nothing w e can do.
W e have to t r y to get the money for our
client'. 'But' says the student 'I have no
money'. Guess what? T h e solicitors say
there's nothing they can do. If the student
can't raise just under £2000 i n 30 days,
it's going to court.
Now perhaps I'm missing something,
but the w a y I see it, £2000 is not a huge
amount of money i n terms of what y o u
can actually b u y with it. I have friends
back at home who are 18, and have
about £30000 worth of debt i n the form
of credit and mortgages. T h e average
starting wage of an IC graduate is around
£15000. Also, if the student doesn't have
the money, what's the point i n sueing?
W h y not wait until the student graduates,
and get back the two grand, plus interest,
and save all the hassle and pointless court
cases? O r a m I missing something? T h e
other thing is that the overdraft wasn't
even unauthorised! T h e bank let the
student have the money! F r o m all
accounts, they didn't even kick up m u c h
of a fuss!
More money matters
Here's some more fun. College
Accommodation! W h y can't Imperial get
the hang of it? T h e college is being run i n
a more and more business-like manner.
New directors are being appointed almost
weekly, and being paid large (ie a lot
more than t w o grand) amounts of money
to do whatever they do (?).
But is accommodation being run well?
The rent i n Southside is £47 a week at
the moment. Next year it will be going
up to £50. Y e t i n m y first year (two years
ago), it was only £45. A n d I seem to
remember being assured that it would be
frozen for three years. H m m m . There are
other colleges i n London w h i c h o w n
residences o n Cromwell Road, and charge
only £20-30 a week.
The accommodation office apparently
has large debts to p a y off. But w h y do
they have big debts anyway? I admit that
things can go w r o n g i n business, but
there comes a point when y o u have to
wonder how m u c h is bad luck, and h o w
m u c h is bad management?
Now, to top it off, they're charging
students full rent to leave their stuff i n
their rooms over the Easter holidays! T h e
reason for this appears to be to get the
students out of hall, as the conference
letting has apparently been over
subscribed b y about 2 0 % . But the best
thing is that they're doing it to students
who live i n halls that aren't even being
used for the letting scheme. A N D the
decision was apparently made without
consulting A N Y of the people that should
have been. H o , ho, ho, what a great bit
of fun! What a pile of smelly stuff that
you wouldn't want to be i n , more like.
