Lord
Penney
L o r d Penney, O M , K B E , FRS, creator of
the British atom bomb and Rector of
Imperial between 1967 and 1973, died on
March 3rd of this year, aged 81.
William Penny was one of the most
outstanding mathematicians and physicists
of his generation. In 1944 he travelled to
A m e r i c a to w o r k an the Manhattan
project; the project culminated in the
invention of the World's first atom bomb.
In 1947 L o r d Penney was put in charge
of the development of a British atom
bomb. A c c o r d i n g to the Independent
Newspaper, he was 'an active and
inspiring leader' during atomic testing in
Australia in the early 1950's. Over thirty
years later an Australian R o y a l
Commission investigating the testing
heard evidence that the tests had been
unsafe. W h e n questioned by the
commission L o r d Penney acknowledged
that he had devised a way of misleading
Australian scientists about the radiation
levels an nuclear dust clouds, providing
them with samples that w e r e a few days
old, so that some of the short-lived key
isotopes had decayed.
L o r d Penney was appointed chairman
of the United K i n g d o m A t o m i c Energy
Authority ( U K E A E A ) in 1964. O n his
retirement from the U K E A E A in 1967 he
was appointed rector of Imperial College.
In 1935 L o r d Penney married his first
wife Adele Elms, who died in 1944. They
had two sons. He married again in 1945,
to Joan Quennel.
Illegal
A new student broadsheet, distributed
around Imperial College campus this
week, is illegal. The one page first edition
of 'The Free Student' fails to include the
printer's name, thus contravening
publishing law. The Free Student is
published under the auspices of the
Conservative Party and is based at Party
Headquarters Smith Street.
The Y o u t h co-ordinator at Conservative
headquarters described the omission of
the printer's name as an 'error'. He
refused to release the telephone number
of the editor of 'The Free Student', Rob
Marven. The Y o u t h co-ordinator did not
want the gentleman concerned 'pestered'.
He then claimed that he had overall
editorial responsibility for the publication
even though his name did not appear on
the credits.
The publication states that it aims to
promote 'individual freedom of choice'
and to 'fight against socialism in colleges
across the country'. A c c o r d i n g to a source
at Tory H Q the 'Conservative Students'
based the tabloid format of 'Free Student'
on the left of centre publications.
Hustings Hassle
The Sabbatical candidates were given a
rough ride at the St Mary's hustings. The
candidates arrived at the Medical School's
union just at the close of a happy hour
on Monday evening. One candidate said
'It was like holding hustings in the middle
of a RCS beer festival'.
Despite Imperial Union Honorary
Secretary Murray Williamson explaining
the purpose of the meeting to assembled
students, candidates were heckled with
calls of 'What are you doing here?'. One
candidate was sufficiently offended by the
heckling to lodge an official complaint
with Imperial College Union.
Murray Williamson said that hustings at
St Mary's next year are unlikely. He
stated that the only reason hustings were
held in past years at St Mary's was
because Imperial's were scheduled over
lunch-times. H e thought that next year
there would be one evening hustings on
the Imperial campus.
This year's hustings at Imperial were on
Thursday 7th M a r c h in the JCR. Voting
takes place on the 11th and 12th March
in all departments.
Candidates standing for the Sabbatical
posts of Imperial College U n i o n are as
follows:
President Zoe Hellinger, A d r i a n Johnson,
Spenser Lane, Michael N e w m a n
Deputy President Jonathan Griffiths
Honorary Secretary Steve Farrant
Felix Editor A d a m Harrington
