Elections
By now, elections are upon us. I wish all
candidates good luck—may the best
m a n / w o m a n win.
Welfare
Last week's welfare campaign was a
storming success. M y thanks to everyone
who helped—especially Riverside who
provided the materials and expertise for
the health fair.
Accommodati on
The sale of Montpelier has been put on
ice for a further month pending legal
technicalities. It is becoming increasingly
clear that the purchase of Clayponds
could prove to be one of the costliest
errors the College has ever made. Whilst
the bedstock has increased by 400 places,
so has the residence deficit. 1 sincerely
hope that w h e n rent levels are set in
April, students are not asked to bail out
College for mistakes made by ex-
employees and senior officials covering
their own backs.
Transport
V a n insurance is now being handled by
Endsleigh. A l l drivers are required to fill
in a van drivers' questionnaire. Please see
Michelle in the Union Office if you
haven't already received one via your
club/society.
