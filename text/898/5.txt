So, W h a t D i d
Y o u D o Last
Summer?
FELIX
The scene: IC's party time o n Friday
night, you're dressed to kill a n d you've
finally managed to manoeuvre today's
love interest into check-mate. Ouch! It's
small-talk time! But this is not Freshers'
Week—no more feeble ' A ' Level/School
inquisitions here. This is the advanced
session; long silences a n d hesitant
questions prefixed b y the ubiquitous 'so'.
'So...what did y o u do last summer?'
There—it's out. T h e question hangs
between y o u like Damacles' sword. Does
an inappropriate answer imply doom? D o
y o u answer truthfully about that bar job
in the P i g a n d Whistle? D o y o u lie
outright? (Well, actually I piloted Richard
Branson's private hot air balloon). O r do
you take the 'truth plus' embelishment
path?
It's embarrassing isn't it? W h y should
you have to embelish in the first place?
Probably the P i g a n d Whistle was all that
was available in the last weeks of July,
w h e n y o u finally resigned yourself to
looking for summer work. Isn't there
anything more rewarding?
H o w about getting a job lined up before
Easter? W h y not be prepared this year;
set yourself apart from the crowd?
Perhaps y o u have aspirations to run your
o w n business some day? D o your o w n
straw poll amongst peers; I'll bet 9 5 % say
they've considered running their o w n
business some day, yet probably no more
than 5% will have considered h o w they
might achieve that aim. If b y this stage
you're thinking: o w n business? Summer
work lined up b y Easter? W o r k with
cocktail-credibility? (i.e. good for small
talk) y o u m a y be interested to k n o w a
little bit more about m y summer work.
I've spent the last two summers
working in A m e r i c a for the Southwestern
Publishing Company. In 1989 I was o n a
sales internship, where I r a n m y o w n
business, marketing school books. I
turned over about $10,000 in the
summer. Last summer I w a s promoted
and r a n a five m a n team as a student
manager responsible for $26,000 of
business. This year I shall be working
with other managers a n d about fifteen
students.
A s m y business has grown, so has m y
experience a n d confidence. A n d not only
can I discuss b y business interests in the
US at cocktail parties—it also makes for
interesting conversation w i t h potential
employers.
After all, h o w many other milkround
candidates have r u n their o w n business
and made a profit?
Last summer, the top first year (with
Southwestern) made $20,516. T h e
average first year made around $3,500.
A n d some made no money; that's the real
w o r l d of business.
Do y o u feel above average? D o y o u
want to set yourself apart from your
peers? What are y o u going to do this
summer? Come along to room 542 i n
Mech E n g at 12.45pm o n Friday 8th
March, or telephone 071-701 0786 a n d
find out h o w y o u could improve your
party talk.

Boring Lectures Column
George's
Diary
Monday 25 Feb
Went to see Kindergarten C o p at Fulham
Road cinema with Henry. Couple of pints
in the Goat in Boots first, y o u just k n o w
they won't stay quiet and w e both had to
go for a piss half w a y through the film.
Friday 1st March
Out with Henry, met a few mates o n the
way. Southside, Union, legless. Tried to
come o n to a pretty black girl but got put
down severely. Henry went back to a
mate's house for a smoke. I was feeling
randy so decided to call o n Nadine, an
American girl I keep trying to seduce.
She didn't seem to mind being knocked
up at 12.45am.
'Hi, Nadine, it's George.'
'George, what are y o u doing here?'
'I was o n m y w a y home from the
Union, I just thought I'd call o n y o u . D o
you mind—what time is it?..Quarter to
one—sorry. I didn't wake y o u up did I?'
'No, we're always up. M y brother's
here, he's stying till Thursday.' So no sex
tonight. She promised to phone so I went
quietly.
Saturday 2nd
Out with T i m a n d a couple of A m e r i c a n
girls. One, Melanie, noticed our video,
Tits and Clits. Then the conversation
moved to another film a n d whether John
Holmes had got his whole cock up some
girl. 'It was this long', Melanie insisted,-
'and she only took about this m u c h of it!'
(about a third).
Didn't go very well with the girls,
instead w e went for an Indian at the N e w
Asia in Earl's Court. They told us they
were closed. T h e n a couple of guys came
in behind us a n d got a table. I
complained to the manager. ' H o w come
you let these guys in if you're closed?'
'They very good friends, live two doors
away.'
'Yeah, well I live across the road too,
and we come in here every week, maybe
two times a week! I tell y o u w e won't be
coming in again if y o u don't serve us
now.'
But he didn't want our custom, I left
quietly. That's the last time w e go in
there though.

Sunday 3rd
Compiled a list of courseworks and when
they were due. I just couldn't face it,
went down the pub with Henry for a
lunchtime session.
Dear Kylie,
I a m in love w i t h you. C o m e to m y
loins m y darling, and let us make love.
Huh, 'I should b e so lucky'. Come a n d
'Step back i n time' with me. Please don't
leave m e with 'tears o n m y pillow'. Don't
worry, I won't hurt you, I mean it's
'better the devil y o u k n o w ' anyway. ' H o w
can 1 prove I really love y o u , love y o u '
m y darling? Let m e taste that honeyed
nutty tanged zest of yours.
'Kylie, Kylie,
You make m e feel all smiley'
I want to scratch that bloody Hutchence
eyes out. He's no good for y o u . H e likes
veils that are misty, streets that are blue,
almond looks a n d suicide blondes. 1 love
you.
Signed,
Patrick Pantry.
