The True History of the

Merrick w h o was afflicted by a progressive
disfiguring disease k n o w n as neurofibro-
matosis.
M e r r i c k was born in Leicester in 1860
and his disease became apparent after the
age of five years. After his mother died
his family broke u p a n d he was forced to
work as a pedlar a n d then cigar-maker,
until h i s d i s e a s e r e n d e r e d s u c h w o r k
impossible. In mid-teen age, he spent four
years in a workhouse until he decided
upon a career as a professional freak.

encounter with William Treves, a doctor
at a nearby hospital, w h o conducted an»
examination a n d gave M e r r i c k his card.
Merrick then went to Europe, only to be
robbed a n d left destitute; by a n incredible
effort he made his way back to L o n d o n
and to Treves.

who h a d been prepared for M e r r i c k ' s , b y
now, gruesome sight. B y advertisement in
the London Times the governors of the
L o n d o n Hospital, at which M e r r i c k was
staying, raised enough funds to equip a
b a s e m e n t b e d s i t f o r M e r r i c k . T h e r e it

f a m o u s t o visit h i m . H i s d e f o r m i t i e s ,
however, were worsening a n d he died in
his sleep during April of 1890.
T o s o m e o n e w h o h a s n o t r e a d t h e
book, it may appear gruesome, and in b a d
and Peter Ford
taste; however, there are valid reasons
why it should have been written.
The hypocrisy of the Victorians is very
evident. S h u n n e d , forced into the squalor
of the workhouse a n d subsequent freak-
show performances, M e r r i c k is a n outcast
i n s o c i e t y ; b u t w h e n t h e p a t r o n a g e of
Merrick became popular, he was held as
a prime example of Victorian philanthropy.
Moreover, the close relationship that
develops between Treves a n d M e r r i c k is
a heart-warming one a n d by the e n d of
• the book Treves appears almost saintly.
Merrick, perhaps surprisingly, is unem-
bittered about societies treatment during
his e a r l y life a n d , w h e n living i n t h e
L o n d o n Hospital is constantly thankful.
Nevertheless the book, I feel, fails to
take full advantage of its o w n potential i n
t h a t it w o u l d h a v e g o n e m u c h m o r e
deeply into the sordid world of the freak-
show. A l s o , in the centre of the b o o k ,
there are some very nauseating photo-
graphs that perhaps add cheap journalistic
sensation.
The book is a bit pricey for its size,
retailing at £6.95 in the K a r n a c B o o k s h o p ,
and can easily be read in an afternoon. O n e
feels that, in some chapters particularly, the
book has been padded o u t with irrelevant
facts. Perhaps it is interesting to note that
the publishing of this book has coincided
with the production of a film about M e r r i c k
with one of the screens great sufferers, J o h n
Hurt in the leading role. Nevertheless the
b o o k p r o v i d e s a g o o d r e a d a n d i s a
worthwhile purchase.

Despite the T U C ' s day of inaction, a few
people ventured into I C to hear the
O r c h e s t r a o n Wednesday night. Perhaps
we should gloss over the Beethoven First
S y m p h o n y (the first piece always seems to
suffer) a n d start with the G r i e g piano
concerto, in which the O r c h e s t r a played
really well in support of R i c h a r d C o k e r , a n
R C M graduate, w h o gave a flawless
performance. A few of the strings were out
of key in places, but the brass entries were
impeccable.
After the interval the first item was that
well-worn favourite of amateur orchestras,
the " F o l k S o n g S u i t e " by Vaughan-Williams,
which has some pretty tunes but not m u c h
else to r e c o m m e n d it. T h e final offering was
Kodaly's " H a r y J a n o s " suite, which begins
w i t h a n i m p r e s s i v e " s n e e z e " . T h e
orchestration of this suite is rather
colourful, with prominent solos for h o r n ,
trumpet, violin and viola at various points,
and includes a part for the cembalon -1 don't
k n o w if all Hungarian folk tunes sound the
same to me, but the first movement of this is
very reminiscent of the composer's
" S u m m e r Evening". N o t counting cembalon
and piano, there were five percussionists
and they were kept busy, especially in the
" M u s i c a l C l o c k " piece. The last movement
really allowed the brass to "let r i p " in a loud
and exciting finale.

Dear Colin,
As you have probably heard, last
Saturday saw a very successful
"Bol .cks to Ents" Gig in the Union
Concert Hall. We would like to take
the chance to thank all those who
helped us to put the gig together.
Firstly, Jazz Club and SCAB for
financial support; DRAMSOC and
OPSOC for the stage and lighting;
ACME Disc Co. for the music; IC
Radio for overall presentation; the
badge sellers and equipment movers;
the sweepers and moppers who
made the hall respectable; Ents (??!!)
who lent us their PA/DISCO .... "no
hard feelings"; finally, all the bands,
who played for next to nothing.
By the way, something in the order
of £70 was raised for Rag.
Cheers, SP3

Everyone w h o has been within a quarter
of a mile of the U n i o n Building o n a n
evening will k n o w of the existence of the
J a z z C l u b ' s rehearsal r o o m (labelled, not
altogether inaccurately, the noise room)
but only the favoured few have seen the
deeds committed therein. Until Saturday
night that was.
T h e " B o l l o c k s to E n t s " gig in the U n i o n
C o n c e r t Hall was a n attempt to showcase
some of the bands existing in a n d around
College, which have not appeared before
in the J a z z C l u b / E n t s r u n of things, a n d
as such was something of a n experiment.
I think I a m not alone in considering the
experiment successful.
F i r s t u p w e r e t h e ' M y s t e r y G u e s t s ' ,
who self-deprecatory manner suggested at
all times that something was about to go
wrong, a n d a few things d i d , but they
carried off the mainstay of their repertoire
(solid electric blues) very well indeed.
T h e Ian Ritchie Quintet followed to give
us some tight modern jazz a n d it was
very pleasing to see this go d o w n well as
this is a dozy horse I, for one, have been
trying to flog in College for a while. A l l
the p l a y e r s w e r e e x t r e m e l y c o m p e t e n t
although I felt they d i d not really have
time to settle d o w n a n d blow. B u t then
I'm biased. M e m b e r s of the audience with
' Y ' chromosones will particularly remem-
ber their announcements.
Cliff Rescue and the Helicopters (where
do they get these names?) bounded onto
stage next and proceeded to expend huge
amounts of energy entertaining us with all
t h e r a b b l e r o u s i n g m a t e r i a l at t h e i r
disposal, from G a r y Glitter to modified
S e x Pistols. A s k a version of Paranoid
was particularly greeted for its perversity.
Perhaps musical comment is inappropriate
to a group whose main strength is in pure
e n t e r t a i n m e n t , b u t t h e b a c k i n g v o c a l s
were so far off pitch to be really detri-
mental. G o o d fun though.
T o p p i n g the bill were S P 3

been treadng the thim line between the
' j a z z p e o p l e ' a n d t h e ' r o c k p e o p l e ' i n
College for a couple of years n o w a n d
w h o pleased some of both o n Saturday
night. T h e y suffered a bit from going o n
so late — some of the audience had gone
to beddy byes or been taken suddenly
d r u n k — a n d f r o m f o l l o w i n g t h e H e l i -
copters w h o are not really a n appetizer
for complicated, sometimes elusive music.
T h e performance was slick a n d obviously
very well rehearsed, but sounded m u d d y
some of the time because of the lack of a
well defined lead instrument.
Finally, I would like to give ourselves a
plug by saying " J o i n the J a z z C l u b a n d
i n s t a n t l y b e c o m e a s t a r " a n d m o r e
