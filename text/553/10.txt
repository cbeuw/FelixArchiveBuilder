O n Thursday I circulated around College

Elections
The result of the Met and Mat Dep REp
elections was: J Czernuszka, 24; A Htun,
29. There was only one abstention.
The election will be ratified at the A G M .
Tim Needham is next year's Geoiogy Dep
Rep.
Papers have gone up for External Affairs
Publicity Officer, and Book Buyer. They will
come down three days after someone has
stood.
Bicycle Insurance
Last week I pointed out that bikes are not
insured by the Union if you live in Hall or
House. Since then there have been further
reports of bikes stolen, especially from behind
Linstead.
I gave details of one such policy to students
— Cycleguard. Since then Roger Nuttall has
pointed out to me information from Free-
wheeling and Daily Cyclist.
National and local cycling authorities received
notification of Cycleguard insurance, arranged
through the National Association of British
Cyclists in January of this year. F o r £9.50
membership of the Association the applicant
receives loss or damage cover for a cycle up to
£200 value, third party and personal cover.
However, in March, the Association claimed to
have a membership of 6,000 recruited in two
months, which seems to be rather far fetched.
Also nobody from the A B C had moved into
Linburn House, their quoted address. Evidence
of registration for the Association. Cycleguard
or Cycleguard Managers Ltd (the company
backing the Association) has not been formed.
N o one has yet (in March) received a copy of
the master insurance policy and none of the
authorities M r Bassett, the chairman of the
Association of British Cyclists, claims to have
contacted have any record of him.
Cycle Insurance
A s a student, separate cycle insurance will be
difficult if not impossible to obtain. Cycles can
be covered by some household policies but be
careful — some will only cover the cycle when
it is inside the h o u s e ! Insurance c a n be
a r r a n g e d t h r o u g h m e m b e r s h i p of c e r t a i n
documented and active organisations (compare
Cycleguard!).
Cyclists' Touring Club
Annual membership is £7.00 (£4.20 for age 20
and under) for which you will receive: free legal
aid (which seems to be most successful);
£ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 t h i r d p a r t y i n s u r a n c e ; t o u r i n g
information service; cycletouring magazine
(bimonthly); recommended accommodation
and cycle shops (some with discounts for
members) and local activities throughout the
country. T h e Club also carries some weight in
arguments over British Rail cycle schemes,
cycle tracks, road building schemes, etc and it
is respected by the authorities.
C y c l e i n s u r a n c e is a r r a n g e d t h r o u g h a
Cornhill master policy which covers the cycle
against theft or damage and provides personal
accident cover. The cost for this is approx 6%
of the cycle value with a 15% discount if more
than one cycle is insured.

complete bike and £200,000 of public liability.

FELIX for W U S
Thank you for donating 5p towards last week's
FELIX. Altogether we raised over £60 for the
Third World Scholarship Fund.
Next Year's Committee
By now most of the A G M s would have been
held, so if you are a club/society chairman,
please hand into Annie the line up of your new
committee.
French Kids
Next wee'J*, College shall be further discussing
whether it is right that we in Southside must
tolerate screaming, shouting, running French
kids on campus at a time when revision is a
priority. If you are in Keogh, Selkirk, Falmouth
or Tizard I am certain you know what I am
referring to. If you see me over the weekend
do tell me your views.
Roger Stotesbury
The captain of the IC Boat Club, replies to Mary's article on page 11
I am sorry to inflict upon you all
yet another article o n the never-
ending saga of the Boat Club and
S o u t h A f r i c a . It's unfortunately
r e q u i r e d h o w e v e r t o p r e v e n t
distortions of the truth, of which
our Mary is so fond.
Since my own views obtained
directly in S o u t h A f r i c a m a y be
said to be biased, as is the usual
comment, I would like to bring to
y o u r n o t i c e t h e r e p o r t by a n
independent c o m m i s i o n sent to
investigate activities (interestingly
containing an e x - S o u t h African
coloured, Basil D'Olivera).
It s t a t e d t h a t m a n y s p o r t s
including cricket, soccer, athletics
and boxing were already F U L L Y
integrated, and recommended that
national bodies should review the
situation in the light of the report.
It emphasised that while it c o n -
demned apartheid it believed that
the position of multi-racial sport in
South Africa was changing all the
time.
I feel m a n y of the people in
South Africa (of all colours) feel
deeply resentful when they hear
d e s c r i p t i o n s o f t h e m s e l v e s as
'token blacks' or 'puppets', these
are those actively, and successfully
working at changing the whole of
society and sport in the Republic.
Such slanderous writings of those
totally incompetent to judge them
can only be a sad indictment of the
'politicians' in this country.
Lastly, the student crews with
which we formed great friendships
are from a multi-racial university, of
left-wing views (surely Mary would
approve) who are one of the major
critics of the present government,
although supporting the present
liberalisation tendencies. Must all
people be put in the same basket
as their leaders, it so does that
m a k e M a r y a n d c o m p a n y p r o
Maggie and Sakarhov supporting
Brezhnev for the presidency. Come
now let's have some consistency
please!
