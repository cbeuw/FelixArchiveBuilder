The new ICWA President
Sandra O'Sullivan
President of ICWA shocks AGM
A new President was ratified at last Tuesday's ICWA
A G M . Sandra O'Sullivan was the only candidate for the
post of President and so won the election. However, in a
speech to the meeting she said that in her opinion ICWA
has failed. Sandra said that she would not get rid of
ICWA but would just make it clear to the girls at IC how
little ICWA does for them.
Sandra said that she would not sit on any committees
and this could lead to an attempt by other members of
ICWA to remove her from the position. This
year's President said, "It's just a bit rediculous but all the
rest of the committee are very keen - we will continue
anyway. It doesn't matter about the President." "
Last years ICU President, Mary Attenborough, joked
that she might as well stand for Chairman of the
Conservative Society. (Mary is known for her political
affilations to political g r o u p s other than the
Conservatives and if she was elected C O N S O C
chairman she considered that it would be equally
rediculous). Roger Stotesbury commented that Sandra
was the only candidate, who stood in the ICWA
elections,who actually bothered to come to the meeting.
"It just shows that ICWA cannot survive if there is no
interest," he said.
