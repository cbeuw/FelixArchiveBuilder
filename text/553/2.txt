DEMONSTRATORS REPLY
Dear Colin
As members of the anti-AyatoUah
demonstrators durirg the siege of
the Iranian Embassy, we feel that
the reasons behindthe demonstration
should be made clear. It was
intended to show disapproval of
supporters of a regime which is
inhumane and irresponsible. The
Iranians concerned were taking
advantage of a delicate situation in
order to publicise their feelings for
Khomeini and against President
Carter and the American people.
We did not want to let the World
believe that the British people
would sta'nd by without showing
disapproval of such actions. If the
Iranians have the right to support
the Khomeini regime, then likewise
we have a right to protest. The IC
student who feels sickened by the
manner of the protest should
perhaps consider the chants and
slogans of the Iranian demonstrators
and the unthinking way in which
they worship such a dictator.
Also, in response to your editorial,
it should be said that the police did
not keep the Iranians in isolation.
They were free to lea ve thecompound
at any time in order to obtain food
and drink and to use the toilet.

Highest level of student activity
at IC in years
Dear Colin
I think it is fair to say that IC
students, in general, do not like
getting involved in student union
external affairs, with most demon-
strations attended by just a handful.
It therefore surprises me that when
hundreds of IC students turn out
to demonstrate against the Ayatotlah
Khomeini, the Union sits back and
does nothing!
This was a genuine protest
against Iran's 'spiritual leader', who,
not content with butchering over
eight hundred of his own nation in
the name of Islam, decides to
threaten world peace by kidnapping
the staff of the American Embassy.
Then with Iranian students
having the cheek to take to the
streets of London and extol his
virtues, it was only right that we
should show them what we think.
The ridicule certainly did get
home to the Iranian students and I
am sure that the demonstration in
no way affected the situation inside
the Embassy. But for those that did
feel that it was too frivolous, they
can only blame the Union for not
organising it. The same Union
Officers that complain about
apathy, failed to respond to the
highest level of student activity at
IC in years, and that is a gross
neglect of duty.

TICKLING THE IVORIES VERBOSITY
Dear Colin
In view of Chris Fox's and
other's comments regarding the
responsibility of IC demonstrators
at the recent Embassy siege, I
would like to say a few words.
Although I admit that there was
temptation from the idea of playing
the piano on TV, the main reason
why I wheeled the RCS instrument
was to add my voice to those of
the many saying "don't give us
that Ayatollah crap". While I was
present the mood was certainly
one of carnival and I feel that my
contribution, and that of most
others on the IC side of the fence,
was to further this mood and
definitely not intended to provoke
violence.
I felt that the presence of the
pro-Khomeini demonstrations was
insulting to our nation and deserved
to be ridiculed by that 'Great
British sense of humour'. Why
insulting? you may ask. In pledging
their support for Khomeini, the
Iranian demonstrators were sup-
porting the further detainment of the
fifty American hostages in Iran. (It
is interesting to note here that in
this case it was the 'host nation' to
the terrorism (Britian) that freed
the hostages, simply in upholding
its laws and protecting foreign
diplomats. Does Iran condone the
actions of the terrorists who are
still playing with the lives of fifty
innocent people?) It appears the
Khomeini regime itself is playing
the terrorist no wonder they are
prepared to sacrifice the odd life or
twenty. I deplore terrorism and
cannot in any way sympathise with
supporters of any kind of terrorism.
For Khomeini followers to parade
our peaceful and civilised streets,
trying to justify the holding of the
American hostages by offering
themselves in, shall we say, part
payment, seems to me barbaric
and an insult to us.
No: I am not a skinhead/Nazi
NF/a Buddhist monk; I believe in
peace — else why did not I throw
bricks rather than tickle the ivory.
Yours, a little offended

ISLAMIC Society comments
Dear Colin
Reference to the article on
Relations Between Iran and the
United States in last Friday's
FELIX: I would like to point out the
following.
Mr Justin Newland does not
have any knowledge, however,
basic about Islam. He mentions
that Islam means God, but the
word means submission to the
God. He speaks about Moham-
medanism whereas we O N L Y
regard ourselves as MOSLEMS, ie,
those who submit to God. We
regard Mohammad as a human
being, just as we regard Moses and
Jesus as human beings; we believe
that they were all prophets with
essentially the same message. Each
coming to give the truth. We also
believe that present day Christianity
and Judaism is distorted from the
original versions and therefore the
remaining true teachings are those
in the Quran (still in its original
form) and in the documental life of
prophet Mohammad.
Mr Newland — surely not a
historian of great stature — lays
down a theory about the aryan
races which exposes his ignorance
about the situation in Iran. Let me
assure Mr Newland that the whole
of the Moslem world is in turbulence
because the teachings of Islam
prohibit all forms of Evil (ref
Quran), regards men and women
as equal before God. It stresses
that a Moslem's duty is to eradicate
the Evil. He must use all routes laid
down by God to do. this. (He
cannot give back the other cheek
when faced with evil.)
The Islamic Society of Imperial
College has sent a brief guide about
Islam to all students and most staff.
The aim was to clear many mis-
conceptions about Islam, common
in England. I suggest Mr Newland
reads his.

Dear Mr Editor
We would like to communicate
our displeasure at the polysyllabic
diarrhoea emanating from the
stylus of Mr Newland. Hisadscititious
verbosity merely serves to obfuscate

DEMO
Sir
The counter-demonstration by
IC students attracted much adverse
criticism in your letter columns last
week. The balance needs to be
redressed.
It was suggested that the demon-
stration hindered negotiations with
the gunmen. There is no evidence
to support this. The demo was
conducted in good humour and at
a safe distance (set by the police).
If it had been decided that the
presence of demonstrators was
adversely affecting negotiations the
police would have dispersed the
crowd. '
It was also claimed that the
behaviour of the students betrayed a
complete indifference to the tragic
events in Iran. Many full-time
students are able to tolerate
violations of international law and
basic human rights only because of
the lack of opportunity to satisfy
their conscience.
However, when supporters of
the religious zealot who presides
gleefully over such traversties of
justice sing his praises just a
hundred metres down the road it
warms my heart to see so many
students take the chance to exercise
their democratic right and show
their disgust.
It would have been irresponsible
to let slip this chance of showing
our condemnation of the Ayatollah
Khomeini.
Someone (in the anonymous
letter) was concerned at the way
our message was put across. But I
ask you, how does one argue with
a brainwashed fanatic who seriously
believes that the gunmen were CIA
spies?
Yours faithfully

Pseudo-intellectual
ramblings
Dear Colin
Justin Newland in his article on
the Iranian crisis failed to explore
the fundamental reasons why this
is one of the most serious events of
the post-war period. His pseudo-
intellectual ramblings left me
wondering why he had bothered,
his vocabulary appeared to be
designed to overawe rather than
inform the reader.
What is important is that the
Iranian 'students' have violated
diplomatic immunity, the invasion
of the US Embassy was an act of
war since the Embassy constitutes
American soil. If the Americans
agree to the terms demanded this
would then put every foreign
embassy in the world at risk. We
have an impasse. The Americans
attempted to break this by military
action, the one opportunity they
had resulted in a dismal debacle
with the hostages dispersed.
However, pressure will be applied
and, in the interests of international
diplomacy through which peace is
maintained, must be successful.
The Iranian leadership must appre-
ciate that fact.
Mr Newland misses his chance
to contribute to this discussion
with his fatuous essay. To accuse
all western media of being "notor-
iously biased" is libellous. He fails
to state that the UN is there to
cope with such situations, in this
respect there are parallels with the
fate of the League of Nations.
His historical perspectives are
rather weak, especially when
concerning the Papal Empire (I
assume he means the Holy Roman
Empire, he does not mention that
to a large extent the temporal
power of the Pope depended on
the incumbant Emperor and the
support of the Hapsburg mon-
archies. To also equate Islam and
Hitler's anti-semitic policies beggars
description, it fully deserves the
derision it must incure.
In the final analysis, Mr Newland's
article is no more than the ramblings
of one who aspires to literary
mediocrity.
Yours sincerely
