First a big thank-you to everyone who wrote an article for this week's
• FELIX. Derrick Everett for the review of the IC Wind Ensemble and the IC
Symphony Orchestra. Mo and Tansy for a comprehensive report on Ten
Tors. Steve Hutchings, Mickie Marsh, Steve Groves and Marie-Therese for
their help with the photographs. Roger Stotesbury, who is leaning over my
shoulder, for letting me misspel his name on the front page. Tim Hillyer for
being a hero ("as usual" - T.H.). Everyone who wrote letters - no matter what
side they're on.
The book, the Elephant Man was reviewed by Allan on page 9. It is a moving
book and I look forward to the film.
Cheers to Maz and Ian and anyone else who I have forgotten to mention. I've
just realised that Steve Groves will be angry with me for giving Mickie Marsh
a credit for his front page picture - sorry Steve.
With reference to the Justin Newland article in last week's issue. There was
a printing error. Justin did write that Islam means submission to God.
Julia Towns has just asked me to write that she needs a Goalkeeper for the
Ladies Hockey tour of Holland on Fri 23 May to Mon 26 May. The
accomodation is with Dutch people and most expenses are covered. Due to
exams it has been difficult to get a complete team together even with the
temtation of going to Zandvort ("a place with a fantastic beach " - J.T.) If you
have a basic knowledge of hockey and are interested please contact the
captain, Julia Towns, in Botany G10.
The ICU A G M is next Tuesday in the Union Concert Hall. Let's make it
quorate.
I hope you really enjoy the Silwood Ball tonight.... I will be asleep but I'm
looking forward to it next year. THe review of the year is coming together
nicely and there are going to be quite a few fun photos never printed before in
the review including the Rugby Club tpuir of Holland!
One last thought. This year at IC could be compared with a football match
' where all the goals are scored at the end of the second half - So much is
happening. Commiserations to Arsenal. Well done West Ham.
Cheers,
Colin Palmer
