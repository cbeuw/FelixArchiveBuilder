IC 1st XI
IC 1st XI vs CHARING CROSS
HOSPITAL
Imperial College 1st XI did little to
restore their dented pride after having
lost at the weekend to Magdalen
College, Oxford by 127 runs. With a
stronger team, Neil Price won the toss,
and chose to bat on a wicket that was
neither conducive to batting yet
offered little assitance to the bowlers.
IC got off to a poor start losing their
first wicket with only five minutes on
the board, but an excellent partnership
between D Everett and J White began
to heal the wounds and saw off the
best of the bowling until D Everett fell
for 23. As often happens when a
partnership breaks up, J White lost his
wicket to a shot he will not want to
remember. Although we had now
reached 60, time was slipping by and
the need for quick runs was apparent.
These were superbly supplied by Andy
Harris who with Guy Simpkin put on
the biggest partnership of the innings
of 60 runs, 42 of which were hit by
Andy in 20 minutes, including 6 fours.
With tea imminent and with the need
for more runs, wickets fell quickly with
a valuable contribution of 20 from
Sam Seneviratne. The declaration
made at tea at 139-7 proved to be over
generous and although Prasana
D'Silva took 3 for 31 and the bowling
was of a high standard only 3 an over
was needed. This soon increased to 5
due to tight bowling from M Ellacott
and R Fefield and with very good
catches being taken. With only seven
overs left, 23 was hit off the first over
and they had little trouble getting the
rest. It was a much improved per-
formance and IC should do well in the
Cup on Sunday.

IC 1st XI vs Kingston Poly 1st XI
Having arrived at Harlington more
than an hour too early, Price withdrew
his team to a local hostelry to discuss
the afternoon's tactics. Suitably
refreshed, and inspired by talk of
actually a winning a game, IC won the
toss and elected to bat.
The openers, White and Slator, were
cruising to a large total when Slator
was caught with the score at 40. This
brought Simpkin to the wicket. He
faced one ball and returned whence
he came. Kenrick then spent twenty
minutes avoiding scoring a run, and
was then given out.
Meanwhile, White was scoring
steadily. Seneviratne joined White and
was soon tearing the bowling apart,
before White was unfortunately run
out for 67. Seneviratne continued his
stylish play with Salter hacking at the
bowling at the other end. Despite
being dropped three times, Salter was
out for 13. This left Price to come in,
score a run and then declare at 157
for 5 with Seneviratne 60 not out.
Ellacott, incensed by not being
allowed to bat, opened the bowling
with his medium pace mediocrity. He
managed to take two wickets for
eleven runs before being taken off by
Price and led away to the outfield. At
the other end, Silva, who was not
bowling at his best, was replaced by
the dynamic Seneviratne who took one
wicket. Price toiled without success at
the other end. Ratnam was brought
into the attack, but not even his naked
pace and nasty glares could capture a
wicket. This was left to Simpkin, who,
bowling his gentle daisycutters, forced
the omnipresent Seneviratne to take
two fine catches. Alas, time was not
on our side and at the close of play
Kingston Polytechnic were 121 for 5,
even though the groin-stained Slator
was brought into the attack for the last
few overs.
Result: a draw.

ANTI-APARTHEID GROUP
A n Imperial College Boat C l u b team has
returned from a tour of S o u t h Africa. It
has now been discovered that they have
offered to lend a S o u t h African team their
boat in order to row in the Henley regatta
this summer.
This would be using Imperial College
U n i o n facilities to e n c o u r a g e s p o r t i n g
links with South Africa.
T h e U n i o n h a s t h e right t o c o n t r o l
these facilities. T h e Anti-Apartheid G r o u p
calls on all opposed to apartheid to c o m e
along to the A n n u a l General Meeting of
I C U o n Tuesday 20th M a y at 1:00pm in
the U n i o n C o n c e r t Hall and oppose this
misuse of our facilities.
The views expressed in this article are not
necessarily those of the Editor of FELIX
S o u t h Africa is a racist state. In recent
years some cosmetic changes have been
m a d e i n s i d e t h e c o u n t r y . O c c a s i o n a l l y
blacks play in white teams and vice versa
and there is also some sporting fixtures
between the four main racial groups. This
does not change the essentially racist way
sport is organised nor cannot in anyway
begin to change the vast imbalance in
facilities whereby the largest racial group
receives the most inadequate facilities.
The S o u t h African team at Henley will
be white. If we allow Imperial College to
s e e m t o s u p p o r t the p r e s e n c e of this
team it will be seen as a slap in the face
for the vast majority of S o u t h A f r i c a n
people and as a show of support for the
racist regime. T h e Anti-Apartheid G r o u p

IC 2nd XI vs HOUNSLOW
IC won the toss and elected to bat.
This decision looked dubious as the
first three wickets fell for 17 runs;
however, Nick Croft was in fine form
and held the innings together with a
fine 53, including six fours and a six.
Redmond (15) and Salter (11) sup-
ported Craft and IC were 122 for 8 at
tea. Confident of victory, Salter
declared at this score. This left
Hounslow to get 123 runs off 40 overs.
Hounslow were 25 when their first
wicket fell. A fine throw from Magness
on the cover-point boundary caught a
batsman out of his ground. Redmond
was brought on to replace Sen and
took a wicket with his second ball.
Bowling his assorted legcutters and
donkeydroppers, Redmond took
another two wickets. Meanwhile, the
pace of the man-of-the-match Croft
captured two wickets.
With twenty overs to go, Hounslow
required only 55 runs for victory and
then 30 off the last ten overs. However,
fine bowling by Croft and Ellis allowed
Hounslow only two runs off the last
ten overs â€” a remarkable feat. At the
close of play, Hounslow were 95 for 8
and this most enjoyable match ended
in a draw.
As a footnote, I should like to add
that the IC team set a record by
staying in the bar at Harlington longer
than the opposition!

ATHLETICS
The UL Championships and the trial
for the team to compete in the BUSF
Championships have been combined
into one event, which will be held at
Motspur Park on Wednesday 21st May
at 3:00pm. It is probably that many of
the athletes selected for the BUSF
Championships (which take place in
Nottingham on the 7th and 8th of
July) will be from Imperial.
Would all track or field athletes,
male or female, who wish to take part
in the trial please sign either of the
notices which have been placed
outside the Multi-gym in the Sports
Centre or in the Cross-Country notice-
board in the Union or contact Evan

advertise the activities of our Boat C l u b

W e hope that the shame o n the name
of Imperial College c a n be lessened by a
strong stand against sporting links coming
