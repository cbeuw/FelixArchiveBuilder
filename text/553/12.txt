CRICKET
IC1st XI vs CHURCHILL
COLLEGE 1st XI
The IC team were forced to
make an early start in order to
arrive at Churchill in time for
an 11:30 start. The early start
was a bit much for many with
Crowe, in particular, showing
very few signs of conciousness
all day.
Skipper Price won the toss
which was the only good
thing he did all day. IC
batted first. Everett (17) and
White (53) got IC off to a
. good start on a good wicket
This start to the innings
might not have been so
good if the opposition had
held on to one of the many
chances the opening pair
offered. Stantiford scored
twenty lucky runs but was
put to shame by Simpkins
who has perfected the art of
scoring runs off the edge.
Simpkins and Turner saw IC
through to lunch.
Turner's lunch weighed
heavily on his stomach and
he soon departed for six
runs. Simpkins' run of luck
continued until he reached
53 when he lobbed a simple
catch to square leg. For-
tunately Morton had arrived
on the scene and he showed
his true class rushing to a
quick 50. Morton's modesty
showed through when he
declined the opportunity of
being outright top scorer
and threw his cricket away
on 53 runs.
The tail enders led by
Price never looked capable
of scoring runs, but Price
was able to declare on the
respectable total of 230 for
9.
Ellacott and Crowe were
given the new ball. Neither
seemed to know how to use
it, but Ellacott picked up one
wicket. Slator was quickly
brought into the attack and
it is safe to say his bowling
has not improved since last
year. He bowled his usual
full tosses and long-hops but
sneaked a wicket before tea.
After tea Slator continued
with the same rubbish but
actually took two wickets
with consecutive balls. He
then avoided a jug by not
going for a catch off his own
bowling on the hat-trick ball.
Eventually Churchill started
to hit Slator all around the
ground and he was wisely
removed from the attack
with figures of 3 for 34.
This left Crowe (3 for 19)
and Silva (1 for 16) to clean
up the rabbits. Both bowlers
are flattered by their figures.
With a run-out at the end,
Churchill were dismissed for
106, giving IC a convincing
win by 124 runs.
The first victory of the
season was celebrated in
suitable fashion.

C R O S S C O U N T R Y
For the third consecutive year the
Cross-Country Club went on tour to
the Batavierenrace in Holland. As last
year we teamed-up with St Mary's
College, Twickenham, added a few
past masters of more mature years to
drive the minibuses, and the Impalas
were reborn.
At 5:00am on Thursday 24th April
the team assembled outside the Union
and the minibuses headed for Dover
to take the 8:30am ferry to Zeebrugge.
There followed the drive across
Belgium and Holland to reach Nij-
megen. The yellow minibuses went all
the way at a stately 40mph with the
blue van in hot pursuit. Nijmegen was
reached at 7:30pm and we were too
late for our first Dutch Mooney. Not all
was lost and we persuaded the race
organisers to pay for a trip to a local
hamburger joint, complete with Knicker-
bocker Glory. We also met our hostess,
Ellen Brahens who had looked after us
so well last year.
The race itself is a twenty-five stage
relay starting at midnight on Friday in
Nijmegen, passing into Germany and
finishing at 5:00pm on Saturday in the
grounds of the polytechnic at Enschede.
Six of the stages are for ladies and there
are two restarts during the race in
order to keep the field together. Of the
one hundred and fifty teams competing,
fourteen were foreign, including
Surrey, the only other British team,
Germans, Swedes and for the first
time a Polish team (who seemed to be
subject to a no fraternising edict).
Last year the Impalas were seventh
and despite being short of three
runners were looking to do well again
and were, as ever, intent on thrashing
Surrey. On the first two stages Dawn
and Alan got the team off to a fine
start and by the end of the third stage
we had taken the lead four minutes
ahead of their nearest rivals Surrey,
despite the appalling weather con-
ditions. Throughout the night this
advantage was extended until the
tenth stage when Delft, the eventual
winners, took the lead, but third team
Surrey were over eight minutes down.
During the morning stages, Delft
went further ahead and Surrey made a
little ground until after eighteen stages
they were only three minutes adrift.
The shortage of runners meant that
three of the team had to race for a
second time during the afternoon.
Despite this we opened up our lead
over Surrey again and although Delft
were by now uncatchable the Impalas
held second place with some fine
running and a brave Surrey made it a
British double by finishing third.
The whole team ran superbly with*
most people finishing in the top ten on
their stage. A special mention for
Louise Barnes who became the first
Impala to win a stage outright, and
came back to record a very fast third
place on stage 22. Martin O'Halloran
came second on the longest stage and
bounced back to run well on the final
leg, and Bryan Acford, who despite
having no sleep ran twice, recorded
the second fastest time on both
occasions.
Following the race there was a
massive party in the unusally designed
union building which seemed to go
pretty well; however, the writer's
recollections are somewhat blurred on
this point.
For the return journey on Sunday
the yellow minibus was once again in
less than perfect health and cruised
up the hills on the M2 in first gear. We
finally reached London at 2:30am on
Monday.
Still when twenty-two bodies fell
onto the pavement outside the Union,
all were of one mind. The Impalas will
be back next year and aiming to go
one place better!
