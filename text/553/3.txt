11th May
Conductor D Edwards
The annual 1812 Overture concert
is now something which most
people in College look forward to
and everyone hears. A large crowd
gathered in the sunshine on the
Queens lawn to hear the Wind
Band, many with picnic lunches, a
few with tablecloths, and at least
one ice-bucket. The band began
with Finlandia by Sibelius, a
rousing piece which was given a
really vigorous performance. The
Wind Band version of this piece is
as exciting as the full orchestra
score, although the brass instru-
ments don't seem able to play the
scales as fast as the strings, so this
version goes a little slower. Then
there was a complete change of
mood, with Scott Joplin's The
Entertainer and a medley called
Instant Concert (or something) in
which the audience could play
'spot the tune'. I lost count.
Next we came to the big one,
The 1812 Overture, with everything
except strings and chorus. Some of
the tempi were a bit suspect and
the bass line could have been
stronger, but at least there were
enough bell-ringers for this perform-
ance. Most of the cannon fired
succesfully, and produced a louder
bang than Kensington has heard
for at least a week.
Instead of finishing with the 1812,
which would have been the obvious
programme order, the Wind Band
ended with Elgar's 4th Pomp And
Circumstance March. If they'd
played the first of these, I'm sure
most of the audience would have
sung along. A good patriotic note
to end on.
Siege through the eyes of a camera - by Mickie Marsh
11:40am go for a pint. Wonder
what all these police are doing
about here. Suppose there may
have been another Lybian shot.
12:35pm Colin says someone's
been shot at the Iranian Embassy
including some policemen. So off I
rush to Linstead and collect my
camera gear and a couple of rolls
of film Arriving at a police cordon
at 12:35 I ask what has happened.
The reply was, "Don't know, mate.
We think it's a siege." When I ask
where I can get some information,
I'm told to go round to the press
enclosure. The rest is history; six
or seven gunmen had held up the
Embassy staff and a diplomatic
patrol police officer.
Given the situation, what could I
do only armed with a camera, a
few lenses and a FELIX 'press pass?
Almost straight away we had a
semi press conference where we
were told there were two or
possibly three gunmen holding
hostages and making demands. We
were not allowed to ask any
questions.
People were being evacuated
from Princes Gate, including a
girls' school next door but one to
the Embassy. Some of the girls
were obviously quite shocked. A
NBC reporter interviewed two of
the girls for US television.
It was obvious that around the front
nothing much is going to happen,
so I try to go round the back. On
the top of the swimming pool a
decent view is to be had, though
after ten minutes we are moved on.
Try Weeks Hall, but the Chief of
Security won't let me in with a
camera, even though I'm from
FELIX. Next try Garden Hall, via
IC Radio entrance, thanks to Dave
Fuller. Inside we get quite a good
view of the gardens behind the
Embassy. There is a lot of police
activity both on the ground and on
the roofs. The view was ideal, then
we heard about the twelve noon
deadline, when they claimed that
the Embassy would be blown up.
I've got to have my camera in
Garden Hall. Then I'll leave it with
a friend and come in early in the
morning.
Meanwhile outside the Embassy,
Iranian protesters wer beginning to
arrive.
Early evening saw people offer
themselves as hostages, then the
prayer sessions began.
Wednesday night saw my plans
change as North Side Princess
Gardens was being policed. The
camera had to go in before morning
as I did. A friend from. Garden
Hall agreed to help me 'smuggle' it
in. After a few lost heart beats we
were in.
We were awake by eight giving
us four hours to wait to see if the
terrorists blew it up. Come 11:45
we were evacuated — nothing hap-
pened, but if it did I was ready for
Weeks Hall to fall.
The afternoon saw Barney enter-
tain the crowds with a full reper-
toire of some of his better known
songs, including Rule Britannia,
Entertainer with a few national
anthems thrown in.
Friday saw an 'official' Anti-
Ayatollah march from Mech Eng
with a full prayer session to follow.
Saturday — the Rag Fete Day
heralded the opening of the Queens
Tower and an excellent view of the
Embassy. There was, however, not
much activity on the roof. The
protesters were dwindling in
numbers and by Sunday they were
almost gone.
Monday (and I should have been
drag racing) the police moved into
the Linstead Hall canteen feeding
two hundred at a time with non-
Mooney food, ie, of good quality.
About 3:00pm we heard shots,
but no news. At 7:20pm I was told
of ambulances in Exhibition Road.
Upon seeing eight and making my
way back to Linstead Hall an
ominous boom was heard — the
end had begun.
No way could I get into Weeks
or Garden Hall. So I went up on to
Linstead roof, but couldn't see
anything.
A brief trip onto Elec Eng roof
gave an excellent view. There were
bits of burnt paper blowing all
about with a lot of smoke, then the
flames began to show. Within half
an hour the building was well
ablaze.
By 9:00pm it was virtually all "
over. After a good think, I
decided to sell some pictures to
some daily newspapers. (The fire
hadn't been too good from the
front.)
After a few phone calls and one
refusal from The Times. The Sun
said to bring the roll of film down.
By 11:30pm the prints were ready
— which they accepted.
After a good night's sleep, and a
good reading of the Sun they were
nowhere to be found.
