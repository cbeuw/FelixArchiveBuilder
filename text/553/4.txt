Dear Colin,
In reply to the letters which
condemned the counter-demon-
strations outside the Iranian
Embassy, I would like to clarify
certain points.
There were various issues at stake
during the demonstrations, when
there should only have been one; the
safety of the hostages inside the
Embassy. That would certainly justify
a demonstration by Iranians
concerned about their fellow
countrymen/women's well being.
Instead of seeing banners reading
"Let our people go" or similar
relevant slogans, one was met by
protestors chanting immotive
phrases such as "Death to Carter",
"Death to Thatcher", marching
round and holding up insulting
caricatures of President Carter.
It is difficult to see how that would
have helped the hostages inside the
Dear Sir,
As is to be expected, last week's
FELIX displayed a typical anti-British
bias. Your attitude appears to be that
if it's foreign it's great. Stuff it.
You've gone further this timeT note.
Not only are you anti-British, you're
also anti-Civiiisation. This is to be
understood, since it is the official ICU
publication. I would however remind
you that, in spite of ICU's efforts,
London is still the official and actual
capital of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I
would mention a few points. Firstly
that it is typical of the hypocrisy to be
expected that it should be demanded
that foreign students should be freely
allowed to come here .... provided
they are not from South Africa. In
what way does South Africa differ
from Russia? Both oppress certain
sectors of the population - and SA is a
damn sight freeer than the USSR.
Secondly, the outstanding triumph of
the British security forces in coping
with foreign feuding has conveniently
been ignored. Without their efforts
London and this country in general
would be far less safe than it is.
Thirdly your Editorial and
contributors have taken the side of
the Iranians. Why? Can you so easily
overlook the illegal holding of some
fifty innocent foreigners by the
government in that country. And can
you so easily forget the executions of
hundreds of people for their services
to the previous government. The
Dear Colin
Surfacing from exams at last,
and readng your appeal for amusing
articles in the FELIX last week, I
thought, well — why not? When I
read the article entitled " T h e
American-Iranian Conflict; Some
Historical Perspectives' I could see
why not.
If you were short of articles
during the revision period, then I
do sympathise, but I'm afraid that
you might have considered the
pompous and patronising parable (I
can do alliteration too, you see)
merited a whole page. It wasn't
really so radically revelationary to
be revered, was it? (Anything you
can do . . .)
I think that the piece might have
been better entitled 'Some Personal
Historical Perspectives' — when
reading the FELIX, Justin, ones
Embassy, instead it simply
proliferated anti-Iranian feeling
amongst the British onlookers, be it
justified or not. Similarly, by holding
up pictures of Khomeini and showing
support for him, the situation was
being turned into a political forum,
and naturally attracted demon-
strators opposed to the Ayatollah for
his policy of condoning the holding of
the American hostages in Teheran.
Stupid and unruly behaviour by
counter-demonstrators deserves no
praise, but it is not for those there (A
sickened IC student) hoping for
political gain to criticise that
behaviour, as they themselves
were being publically insulting to the
West, when their sole concern
should have-been for the safety of
those held hostage in the Embassy.
Yours sincerely,
John Chamberlain
trials these people have received are
surely an example of the philosophy
of the government, that is to say that
anyone they don't like is guilty unless
proved innocent. And if they're
innocent then you try the judge for
crimes against the state. Any western
country carrying out this practice
would be instantly condemned by all
the press, including FELIX, but
because it concerns Iran it is
acceptable. Give me the SAS, and
SPG, or even the Mafia, rather than
the Iranian Justice.
Thirdly, remember, if Carter had
succeeded he would be regarded as
the greatest hero ever. Admittedly
the plan displayed the typical
inefficiencies and cock-ups expected
of the USA. However, it is unfair to
slate him so mercilessly. He was
unlucky. Don't forget, if it had been
the USSR Embassy, Iran would not
exist by now.
Fourthly, as long as it effects sport,
any outrage against any foreign
country is allowed by the USSR.
After all, we can't stop "our lads"
from going to Moscow. Who cares
about Jews, Dissidents, Religion,
Afghanistan, Communism, we've got
to win the medals. - Musn't go to SA
'though, must we? Congrats to
RCS for their demo, Congrats to the
coppers and SAS also, commiss-
erations to Carter & the US. Stuff
ICU.
Yours,
Disgusted of Mech Eng.
does not appreciate being lectured
at — we get more than enough of
that all week. The article was not
properly reasoned, was circum-
locutory and most irritating of all, I
have some suspicion that Mr
Newland sits in his room after he
has written a thing like this and
imagines that we are all pouring
over our dictionaries with unmiti-
gated fervour while we try to
decipher the writings of the man
who sees all so clearly.
I was interested to read your
opinions, Mr Newland, but, glad as
a I am that we have such a prag-
matic spokesman at IC, a man of
such vision as yourself — I do
object to reading such a patronising
and opinionated article.
I could have done without you to
tell me why I feel "astonishment
and indignation" at the events in
Dear Colin,
It was with mounting concern I
read the letter from Andy Nicolaou,
Carolin Temple-Bird, Ian Hodgson,
A Gujral, K Pratt and J Czernuszka.
Their letter will spark off an indignant
protest from the fanatical "anti-
A y a t o l l a h " d e m o n s t r a t o r s
themselves, however unlike, to the
best of my knowledge, the co-writers
of this letter, I actually watched both
demonstrations for a period of
several hours on the first day and
about one on the second day and
have a different point to make.
How such a group of articulate and
intelligent students can produce
such a misleading and pompous
letter, implying so much, and submit
to a serious newspaper is beyond me.
Many of us will remember a letter
from one of the above co-writers in
FELIX Issue 534 (Nov 161979) which
was a personal attack on Steve
Hutchings for suggesting that his
photos should be credited. The
writer admitted he knew nothing
about the legal, artsitic and copyright
reasons involved and had never even
met Steve Hutchings but felt he could
call him a "Power Mad Prat" and
finished with a typically pompous
ending that if Steve didn't mend his
ways "what hope for the world?"
Comparison between the two
letters reveals a striking similarity.
The writers seemed to have learnt
not to come straight out with an
admission "that they don't know
what they are talking about" but from
subsequent comments that seem to
be inspired from innacurate press
reports and the assumption anything
I was remotely near would be a farce.
The last paragraph "Are these really
the kind of people who", etc, etc is
more subtle but still worthy of that
previous ending "If not what hope for
the world" etc.
I saw fellow students from IC on
both sides. Many Iranian students
demonstrated their obviously deeply
felt support for their religious and
political G o d , the Ayatollah
Khomeini, with a fervour that was
fanatical.
One of their earliest spokesmen
was from Chem Eng. While I respect
their strongly held religious beliefs as
I expect they respect mine, I fail to
understand their politics or
revolution and consider many
published statements to be
hyppcritical in the extreme. I can't
condone the action of their
government(s) which have not only
flouted the Declaration of Human
Rights which we have adopted but
every diplomatic code. However, I'm
still prepared to fight for the right
of free expresion in the UK, but they
seemed prepared to die for their
Iran, and quite apart from that,
neither of those feelings could
truthfully be attributed to what I
think about it anyway. I am very
surprised that the whole thing
wasn't printed on purple to go with
the prose; it didn't really require
such a load of old cobblers (English
derivation, Justin, meaning rubbish,
supply any expletives you wish) to
tell me that "religion is a clear
protagonist" in the struggle —
possessed of superb political insight
and historical hindsight — I might
have guessed.
I'm sorry, but the whole article
beliefs. Their letter ignored this
protest.
There were fanatical "anti-
Ayatollah" demonstrators, but I
think that most of the IC students
were there because they disagreed
with the amazing "double-think" of
the Iranian Demonstrators who
support their own political hostage-
taking but were calling for the
execution of 91 sympathisers of the
Princes Gate Gunmen as retaliation
for someone else's political hostage-,
taking. In my opinion they chose the
best way to do this, not to confront
fellow students with inflamatory
confrontation but object to their
policies not to the people who were
deeply committed to their cause.
Cheerful and unfrienzied ridicule of
conflicting attitudes has been an
accepted part of British Politics for
over 100 years (listen to Parliament,
or ead political cartoons). I have no
idea what the original organisers
were intending, however, as I do not
Know them.
Maybe the writers would have
preferred them to put forward policy
at UGMs, hand leaflets out etc, most
of the demonstrators however are
not as active in the Union
unfortunately as the writers. The
letter goes on to imply some kind of
"top level" communication with
themselves and the Police & Home
Office enabling them to comment on
their opinion. It goes on to say that
because Young Skinheads turned up
the next day it was all a mistake, this
is like winding up London Transport
because people write on the seats.
I know my own prejudices and try
to compensate for them, but I have
nothing but respect for the Iranian
students and their committment
though I think their attitudes are
foolish. Maybe I'm wrong, perhaps
they will try and put me right. THe co-
writers seem unable to recognise
their own prejudices, they
immediuately assume the worst,
trivial, and shallowest of motives
from the majority of "boring,
conventional, and less articulate"
students.
I know that I am not "tragically
indifferent to events in Iran" but if
South Kensington is to become a
World Stage we should try to have
serious and objective letters in
FELIX. The letter attacking Steve
Hutchings was appalling enough, but
to apply the same standards as
pompous and pretentious.
Ignorance to such serious subjects
betrays a different sort of "tragic
indifference to events going on in
Iran."
Yours very sincerely,
Francis Rowsell BE1
was built up from arguments as
flimsy as your insight into the
problem. I could criticise the whole
thing, but this is not the place for it
— I probably wouldn't have written
at afl if this article had been a first
from Mr Newland, but this is the
third time I've read this sort of —
wait for it — opinionated, pompous,
inflated, ponderous, tautological
verbal tenesmus from him, I felt
compelled to reply (in the same
vein, of course!).
Yours sincerely
