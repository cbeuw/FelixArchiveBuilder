travelled uneventfully to D a r t m o o r
whilst T o m and Matthew regaled the
passengers with True Life stories from
an appropriate magazine. Tents were
pitched in the boys' area (the mixed

anyway), kit scrutineered and teams
briefed before we p l u n g e d back to
town for a visit to Mooney's Fish and
C h i p s E m p o r i u m . A l o c a l h o s t e l r y
provided tables on which to decipher
the maps and we were all tucked into
bed by Auntie Chris well before lights
out.
Awoken by the tannoy at 4:30, we
crawled out for cold porridge, scalding
tea, runny scrambled eggs and edible
sausages. Then it was packs on and
off to join the other two and a half
thousand people at the start for the
Ten Tors hymn, prayer and chat from
the Bishop and Mayor respectively. N o
going back now!

We started fast to avoid the rush at the
checkpoint at the top of the first tor
and kept up g o o d time despite the
second tor living up to its name to

more of a climb than a walk! Straight

knew our next tor would be tough —
but didn't realise how bad until we had
climbed a really steep road to discover
a still-open pub enticing us! However,
we pressed on and, after asking the
way twice (!) we found Hartor Tor and
were greeted with the cup final result.
No one is allowed to check through a
tor after eight o'clock so we had to
press on fast. The next stretch (excuse
the pun) was mostly along the road to
Princetown and past the prison. This
was certainly the most gruelling part
of the day with blisters, knees, ankles,

Blisters were attended to and supper
cooked — well apart, I'm glad to say!
A good night was passed although my
supper decided it had had enough and
got out while the going was good.
An early morning start saw us at our
seventh tor by soon after eight in the
morning and another fairly flat stretch
got us to our eighth. Unfortunately it

knew that the safest thing would be to

thus the centenary of his death, and it is
appropriate that we should mark the
occasion with a production of one of his
best a n d most popular works.
La Belle Hefene was first performed
at the Theatre des Varietes in Paris
1864. Its plot deals — loosely — with

miles we decided to have a break o n
Lynch — it was during the trek to this
tor that a certain member (blush) felt
as though he would die, but having
survived, the team battled on having
passed Dartmoor Prison (and a few
pubs — how cruel) we reached Hartor
and were soon on our way to Hawkes.
We eventually found it 'hidden' behind

they close at eight o'clock). After a

camped beneath the tor next to a river
for the night.
The food left much to be desired,
although the cook literally put every-
thing he had into it! The team, blistered,
but in good spirits pressed on, waking
up at four in the morning and reaching
the tor at just past six. We then had
the toughest stretch of the expedition
— a long nine mile, three hour walk
without a break, to H u c c a b y . T h i s
stretch certainly took its toll and some
of the team members began to feel the
pace. Things began to drag, tempers
became strained and when a certain M
Smith decided to catch bees with his
net he almost became the subject of
our pent-up feelings. Team spirits at
this point, I feel, bit a low and really
didn't pick up till we finished, greeted
bya jubilant Mr Fox, Andy Smith a n d

T h e teams rejoined at Okehampton
(the army camp and also the start and
finish of the expedition) to exchange
tales and to commiserate with the girls
who put up a magnificent effort. Many
thanks to all concerned especially the
drivers T i m and Chris and of course
Andy Smith who like the girls were so
near yet so far.
