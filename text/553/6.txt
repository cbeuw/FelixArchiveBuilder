coats to live out their lives at the home
for retired E x e c members. Well anyway,
Tuesday s a w the handover meeting in the
sunshine o n the Albert M e m o r i a l steps,
which was well attended. C o l o u r s were
a w a r d e d t o those h a r d - w o r k i n g people
and some silly awards were also given
out to tjjose w h o were judged to deserve
t h e m . J o h n n y of t h e Y e a r w a s u n a n i -

welcome d u e to the high temptation a n d
some of the exec showed large deviant
tendencies. T h e n we all adjourned to the
Queens to celebrate.
T h e Joint G e n e r a l C o m m i t t e e in the
evening was well attended a n d most of
the officers for next year were elected.
However, we still need a Spanner Editor,
so anyone w h o would like to d o this, it is
a V E R Y I M P O R T A N T post a n d we need
someone to start w o r k o n it early. C o m e
and see S i m o n , or myself if y o u want to
do this. A presentation of a goblet was
made to Sir H u g h F o r d in appreciation of
all the w o r k he has done for Guilds, he
then received a standing ovation. Special
colours were awarded to M i c h a e l Cooling
the O C President for his help during the
y e a r . H e d i d e a t five M o o n i e s at t h e
Freshers Dinners so he does deserve it.
U n i o n G e n e r a l A w a r d s w e r e g i v e n to
Jamie A t k i n s o n a n d B r y a n Stephenson
(who?) and J o received a standing ovation
o n the handover at the e n d . T h e first
business of the n e w exec was to adjourn
to the S C R for wine draughts, drink, food
and games, sadistically organised by Ruth.
Nab managed to lose the draughts a n d
the c o n t e n t s o f h i s s t o m a c h . P a t a l s o
managed to lose despite all the helpful (?)
comments from onlookers.
O n a n o t e of s u c c e s s , G u i l d s have
collected £6,000 for R a g this year. £2,000
up o n last year. A fantastic, stunning, far
out total a n d I.think thanks should go to
all t h o s e i n v o l v e d w i t h c o l l e c t i n g this
amount.
The final event of the year the Seaside
i Trip o n Saturday 19th. There should still
be some tickets left s o c o m e into the
U n i o n Office to part with your 75p. T h e
trip is to a mystery destination, n o not
Margate. There a r e all the usual seaside
pastimes, funfairs, paddling in the sea,
watching J o having a swim a n d others.
This is a good chance to have a final fling
before the exams. See y o u all there.

WELFARE CENTRE
THE RHESUS F A C T O R
A b ^ n t o n e baby in every two hundred is
born a Rritaus baby, needing a complete
change of blood. I was o n e of these, so
you c a n blame m y existence entirely o n
blood donors — I would have died at
birth if it was not for people like y o u .
Almost anyone c a n give blood — if you
are' n o t s u r e w h e t h e r y o u c a n , c o m e
along and ask at the session. It's quite fun
really — y o u get a nice relaxing lie-down
and a c u p of tea with biscuits. Y o u also
find out what your blood group is. T h e
m o s t c o m m o n i s O p o s i t i v e , a n d t h e
r a r e s t is A B n e g a t i v e — t h i s o n e is
needed especially.
Giving blood does not take long, a n d
does not d o y o u any h a r m . Y o u could
save someone's life.
P l e a s e c o m e a l o n g t o o n e o f t h e
sessions, which are in the U n i o n Dining
H a l l o n Tuesday 20th May b e t w e e n
10:00 a n d 12:00, a n d 2:00 a n d 4:00; a n d
on Wednesday 21st May between 9:30
and 12:00 a n d 2:00 a n d 4:00. There are
some leaflets stuck o n the wall of the
J C R , if y o u want to k n o w more about it.
There is also a list for people to sign if
they want to c o m e at a particular time.
Please c o m e — y o u r blood is needed!
