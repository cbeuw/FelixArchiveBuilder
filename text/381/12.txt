F E L I X S P O R T
CROSS COUNTRY
F o l l o w i n g crushing victories over Brunch and Surrey in Ux-
bridge, and a best-ever performance (ell, rectly anyway) in the
H P R , the X-Country C l u b truned its attention to U C and L S E
at Shenley over their usual pasture and mud, h i l l y , 5M mile steep-
lechase course. E v e n the absence of one E l l i s , I. (very formal
this), l a i d up in drydock after
an unfortunate confrontation
with hard reality, could not
alter the inevitable (ie we *
won), though it was deemed
the cause of the very slow
start - even Dave Payne was
in the lead at one stage. The
problem of the absence of a
stopwatch and anyone to hold
it was solved, this time, by
the Rob A l l i n s o n wristwatch,
wire mash and first-home tech-
nique: this might have gone
awry had he and Steve Webb
been at all pushed, but the
opposition was so far behind
that they could just coast
home. Steve was given first
place in 32m 10s, h i s first
ever w i n . (Pause for cheers.)
S O C C F f t
l s t XI v Royal Holloway
The most important league seen by all except the ref, to
game of the season for IC first handle i n the process. Refus-
XI took place on the 22nd when ing to give up, IC pressed
they played R o y a l Holloway even harder for the elusive
first XI in a top of the table equaliser, and it eventually
c l a s h . Before the game IC were Came when Ian Postlethwaite,
the only side who could con-
cievably take the league lead-
ership from Royal Holloway
and the only if they managed
to w i n .
The game, played i n ideal
conditions with the sun shin-
ing and the pitch reasonaly
soft underfoot, started briskly
with Holloway showing why
they are top of the table by
p l a y i n g some attractive poss-
e s s i o n football, and i n the
early stage s bewildering the
opposition. A s the game pro-
gressed, however, IC came
more and more into the play
and started using their mid-
field trio to set up some dang-
erous moves and were very un-
l u c k y not to take the lead on
a number of o c c a s i o n s . For
long periods IC besiged their
opponents half but paid the
penalty of pushing too far for-
ward when Holloway made a
quick break and scored the
first goal against the run of
play.
The second half was a sim-
i l a r state of affairs with IC
l o o k i n g much the better team
and attacking the Holloway
goal relentlessly. Boby Day
had a superb effort virtually
pulled out of the net by the
Holloway keeper who 1 eapt
across the goalmouth to make
a Gordon B a n k s type save.
Shortly afterwards Dave Rudd,
who had a good game up front,
struck a perfect ball to the
near post only to see it clear-
ed by the full back who was
whose powerful runs down the
middle of the field have been
a feature of IC play this seas-
on, made a solo burst to the
edge of the area and had his
shot deflected past the spraw-
ling goalkeeper who almost
denied the lads of an equaliser
again.
The last twenty minutes
saw I C tire badly thus allow-
ing Royal Holloway back into
the game and but for a l i t d e
bit of luck they might well
have snatched victory in the
c l o s i n g stages of the game.
The game ended in a 1 - 1
draw and IC l s t can count
themselves as very unlucky
not to have won. A l l credi t
must be given to Royal H o l l o -
way who are a fine footballing
side and I think well deserve
the league title which they
must now surely collect.
On a more personal note,
the game marked one of the
l a s t appearences for IC by
Bob Day who leaves the
college (and the football club)
to go and "work in .Viuili
A f n c a on the 14th of this
month after almost 10 years
loyal service. B r Day who
claims he was football club
fixture secretary in 66 - 67,
(there's no one here o l d enough
to remember that far back) has
played every season while at
college for the cluband in re-
cent years has been a regular
member of the l s t team . A l l
members of the club w i s h him
well in h i s new " c a r e e r " .
P a u l C l a r k e was ahead of two
from U C , one of whom had the
mi sfortune to get l o s t on his
own, course, thus giving Paul
third place. Next to plough
home (is this wit?) was Dave
Houlbrooke followed by a right
motley c o l l e c t i o n : Dave Jones,
R i c h Harrington, Dave Payne,
Mike, Pete, P a d and, starting
l i k e a l l good ' u n s , Mr One-Lap
Hunter. There being only three
to count, the opposition were
somewhat overwhelmed by our
taking the first three p l a c e s .
The same was not true in the
Honorary Footabll Match that
followed: we lost 7 - 2 despite
the inspiration of sharing (al-
most) dressing-rooms with the
A r s e n a l squad. Hero of the
match was Dave Payne. ( T h r e e
times this week, i s this a re-
cord? )
Saturday, the day of the
Nationals, was unusual. Where
were the rain, sleet and snow
we had come to expect? The
National Cross Country Champ-
ionships were h e l d this year i n
Luton over d singularly dry
course on which even the plou-
ghed fields were rock hard,
the only thing to distinguish it
from Crystal P a l a c e track be-
ing an inordinately steep h i l l
of more than sufficient length
to make anyone regret they had
ever set out. In the Junior
race, twice round this three
mile lap, were three stars
from IC. P l a c e d well up in
this three mile lap, were three
stars from I C . P l a c e d in this
field of almost 500 was Ian
E l l i s at 251'st, finding good
application for his rebalanced
gyros on the downhill plough
section. E v e n further up, in
fact almost up with the famous,
perhaos's and maybe's was
R o b A l l i n s o n in 131st place.
Just behind the main bunch,
Mike Welford put in a fine per-
formance finishing 401'st and
A n Example To U s A l l .
The sun i s w e l l known in
South K e n for bringing out cro-
c o d i l e s : in Luton on Saturday
it attracted one 1400 people
along. T h i s was the Seniors'
race: 9 miles long and three
times up that h i l l . The great
cheer at the start came not so
much from the spectators but
from the runners themselves
at the "Oiarge of the L i g h t
B r i g a d e " commentary: at least
one arm was raised bearing an
appropriate answering gesture.
Among those actually in the
race was Steve Webb finishing
5 l 6 ' t h , a gain of 250 on his
previous best and nearly 400
on last year. Somewhere among
the also-ran's was Dave Jones
(wearing number 999 but giv-
ing no alarum on this excur-
sion) i n 697'th position and
among the almost-ran's, in
985'th, was Ian lsherwood.
Tony Weir and Roman Halenko
finished in the lower 700's for
their c l u b s . And so it was
over for anotheryear, we were
left only the stroll back to
the station seeing the sights
of Luton: e.g. Moss B r o s ' s
gasometer. At the station we
were greeted with a perform-
ance by the Sugar Lump Fair-
ies; this gave cause for Steve
Webb to sprint across the
bridge with amazing alacrity;
twelve m i l e s (this Tad takes
three to warm up) and then this
w e l l ! ! this speed was sadly
not matched by B R on the jour-
ney home, during which there
was some talk of an 8 mile
run the following morning: the
w i s e pretended to be asleep.
