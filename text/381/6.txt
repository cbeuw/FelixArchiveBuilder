SCIENTIFIC RACIALISM
The pamphlet, 'Science, Racism and Ideology,' written by an
Open University research team i s a detailed rebuttal of the
E y s e n k / J e n s e n theory of the inheritance of intelligence, which
is used to 'prove' that certain groups, notably Negroes, J e w s and
even the whole working c l a s s , are inherently less intelligent
than various other groups, not-
ably whites and the middle-
c l a s s e s . It traces the history
of these ideas, w h i c h are not
new a n d know the uses to
which they have been put (eg
justifying the murder of J e w s
by the N a z i s ) and those to
which they are being put now,
(cf the call by the National
Front for the repatriation of
coloured people.
The authors separate three
strands of the argument; (i) a
tendency to assume that bio-
logical differences cause rac-
ial differences; (ii) a r i s i n g
from (i), they c l a i m that any
aspect of human behaviour
arises from genetics and envir-
onment and that these are sep-
arable; (iii) belief that IQ tests
measure pure culture - free i n -
telligence, known a s " g " .
When different racial groups
and c l a s s groups are tested
for IQ, there are differences in
the averages obtained. E y s e n k
and Jensen ask, "how much ot
the difference is due to genet-
ics and how much to environ-
ment?" The authors show that
this question is meaningless,
in essence because genetics
Influence the environment and
vice-versea. F o r the genes
produce c h e m i c a l s which
affect other genes, and this
must affect the environment in
which later genetic events
occur. In different environ-

ments the name group of genes
can produce different charact-
e r i s t i c s , thus there are no
such things a s "high IQ genes"
or "low IQ genes," which are
e s s e n t i a l to the E y s e n k /
Jensen theory.
E y s e n k and J e n s e n would
probably concede that the con-
tribution of genetics and of
environment to a particular
trait like i n t e l l i g e n c e i s not
meaningful for an individual,
but would c l a i m that they can
be neasured for a population.
They define heritability a s the
ratio of the intelligence diff-
erence between members of
the name population due to
genetics to the total i n t e l l i g -
ence difference. A population
being a group of people with
s i m i l a r genotypes. For white
populations they give a figure
of 0.8. But this heritability
c a l c u l a t i o n cannot be used to
set limits to genetic or envir-
onmental influence, due to the
interaction mentioned earlier,
they are thus u s e l e s s for their
intended purpose.
The authors then indicate
that IQ tests do not measure
F'jre intelligence, but only the
p o s s e s s i o n of certain s k i l l s
determined by those setting
the test.
Thus the authors destroy
the E y s e n k / J e n s e n theory and
expose the worth l e s s n e s s of
the evidence (IQ scores) which
E y s e n k and Jensen then use to
prove the supposed inferiority,
and others to prove the biolog-
ical imperative o f the present
position of these groups in
s o c i e t y .
It is hoped that one of the
authors w i l l be coming to IC in
the near future to speak on
this subject.

Richard & Linda Thompson
M A N Y people have been a s k i n g who this "minority interest"
duo who are appearing in c o l l e g e tomorrow night. Here is a short
musical history: •
Richard Thompson played s t y l i s h electric guitar in Fairport
Convention in its early days of 1968, when it w a s regarded a s a
folk group. He wrote songs
such as ' ' N o Man's LancT',
"Tale in Hard Time", and
the c l a s s i c " M e e f On The
Ledge". H e stayed with the
band through numerous chang-
es of musical p o l i c y , and con-
tributed many more notable
songs on later albums, among
them "Cajun Woman", "Gene-
sis Hall", "Farewell, Fare-
well", and "Crazy Man Mic-
hael".
When he left Fairport In
1971, he dropped out of the
limelight, but w a s s t i l l work-
ing in a folk duo with L i n d a
Peters, who later became h i s
wife, and did many s e s s i o n s
for old friends, including
Sandy Denny and Andy Roberts
Richards guitar playing has
a l w a y s been notable for its
economy, and his first solo a l -
bum, "Henry The Human Fly",
was a t y p i c a l l y low-key and
engaging record. T h e comina-
tion of R i c h a r d ' s guitar and
growing songwriting ability
with L i n d a ' s warm, strong
vocals proved virtually irres-
istable.
Unfortunately the birth of
the Thompson's daughter limi-
ted the duo's live appearances,
but they d i d play support on
the B r i t i s h part of Traltic's
1974 World Tour.
In their new album, "Hokey
Pokey", Richard plays guitar,
mandolin dulcimers, and piano,
as w e l l a s sharing the lead
vocals with his w i f e . A l l but
one of the songs are by R i c h -
ard, and they vary enormously
from the t itle track to the
sadly reflective "/'// regret it
all in the morning".
You can see them live on
stage tomorrow night in the
Great Hall at 8.00pm. Tickets
are on sale in the union office
from 12.30 today, 70p for IC
students, 80p for other ad-
vance tickets. Some tickets
will be available on the door
at £1.00.
