STUDENT PROBLEMS
AFTER 1214
T H E R A P I D increase in
the numbers of students i n the
years after 1214, despite the
fact that a flourishing comm-
unity of scholars was a l s o est-
ablished at Cambridge, meant
that the king was obliged to
intervene i n the interest of
both the scholars and the town.
The position was made more
difficult in the universities in
1229 when the temporary d i s -
persal of the university of P a r -
is sent many scholars to E n g -
l a n d . Henry III despatched a
series of letters on 3 May 1231
to the sheriffs of the shires of
Oxford and Cambridge and to
the mayors and bailiffs of the
two towns. E a c h sheriff was to
co-operate with the bishop of
the diocese and the chancellor
of die university i n repressing
'rebellious and incorrigible'
students, especially those
malefactors among the student
body, who'pretend to be clerks
and are not'. The k i n g ordered
the sheriffs to see that no stu-
dent remained in the university
who was not under the tutor-;
ship of a Master of the s c h o o l s .
At the same time the respect-
ive mayors and bailiffs were
warned that their exorbitant

rents were l i k e l y to dritfe stu-
dents away. The k i n g ordered
them to allow their lodgings, to
be a s s e s s e d in regard to rents
in the customary fashions, 'ft-
is clear to us,' said the k i n g ,
'that both from this country
and from overseas a multitude
of scholars has come to our
town of Cambridge, which is
very pleasing and acceptable '
to us, since no little advant-
age to our kingdom and honour
to us accrues therefrom.'

points, the two most important
of which are:-
1) T h i s was a very untact-
ful thing to say, e s p e c i a l l y for
somebody c a n v a s s i n g for votes
and particularly as such inform-
ation as a c l u b ' s estimate
should not, i n my opinion, be
divulged before it has been
d i s c u s s e d in the relevant
p l a c e s . I do of course have no
objection to a l l students know-
ing where U n i o n funds go, but
the circumstances i n which Mr
Spencer d i s c l o s e d this e s t i -
mate, which has not yet been
considered for approval, may
prejudice certain negotiations
at many l e v e l s . A s i s quite of-
ten the c a s e when people
speak about things which they
are not d i r e c d y concerned with
(or not yet concerned with in
this case), the b a s i c facts
were wrong . The number of
student members of the G l i d i n g
C l u b i s about fifty and not
about twenty a s was stated,
and in addition there are about
thirty members of staff and life
members (who pay a higher sub-
scription) i n the club, making
it hardly a minority c l u b .
2) A more important point
i s whether, what Mr Spencer
c a l l s minority c l u b s should
have a right to e x i s t if the
U n i o n ' s budget were to be re-
duced. There are bound to be
different views on this, but if
one l o o k s up the "Objects of
ICU By-Laws" the first two,
out of the three objects, are:
a) T h e promotion of social
intercomrse between present
and past students and academic
staff of the Imperial College.
b) The encouragement of
interest by students in matters
outside the C o l l e g e cirriculum,
e s p e c i a l l y cultural and athletic
interests. It i s to further these
objects that U n i o n c l u b s are
set up, and the wider the var-
iety of c l u b s the more s u c c e s s -
fully these objects can be ful-
filed. Such objects mean that
any of the c l u b s in Imperial
C o l l e g e cannot be a commer-
c i a l enterprise and hence try-
ing to apply 'cost-effective-
n e s s ' , as Mr Spencer implied
he would l i k e to do, could
threaten the existence of many
c l u b s . I f cuts were necessary
then a l l c l u b s would have to
make cuts, but none would be

prepared to accept dispropor-
tionate reductions just because
somebody i n the Union E x e -
cutive doesn't consider their
a c t i v i t i e s important.
H a v i n g made those two
points, I would l i k e to suggest-
to Mr Spencer that if he were
elected to the post of H o n . Sec,
he would q u i c k l y change his
v i e w s and learn how (he c l u b s
within I C are organised, i f he
really wants to represent the
majority of students who be-
long to the hundred or more
c l u b s that exist at I G Maybe
what Mr Spencer said at the
H u s t i n g s , was just something
said " i n the heat of the mom-
e n t " , but whatever the reasons
he w i l l have reduced his chan-
c e s of being elected.
If Mr Spencer is elected
then I hope he w i l l take note
of what I have said in this
letter, and e s p e c i a l l y the fact
that one of the major aims of
Imperial College Union is to
bring as many a c t i v i t i e s as
p o s s i b l e within the financial
c a p a b i l i t i e s of the students
at I C .

Dear Sir,
I was horrified to hear of
the c r i m i n a l proposals made
in the N U S document, relating
to student sit-ins, entitled
' D i r e c t A c t i o n Briefing'. F o r
those of you who have not read
the reports I w i l l quote from
the Guardian: 'A guide, which
includes advice on the laws of
trespass, use of drugs and
drink, and, more controversi-
ally, recommends photocopying
"incriminating documents"
was sent out two weeks ago to
about Q00 student unions
under "General Hints" comes
the advice: Files can be very
revealing, a lot of dirt can be
found out about the authorities;
every use should be made of
such information."
I cannot believe that such a
document can do anything other
than alienate public opinion.
Mr J.Randall said on L B C , "It
was a private communication to
student union presidents and
hence not intended for public-
ation." N o w it i s we, the stu-
dents, who are responsible for
the a c t i v i t i e s of the N U S , and
we are the ones who suffer
eventually. Hence I believe Mr
P h i l l i p s should release the
document at the next U G M ,
where we can p u b l i c l y reject
its intentions.
T h i s leads to my next point
- to quote from the Broad L e f t
statement in l a s t weeks Sennet;
"Conference is the Governing
Body of NUS and decides pol-
icy which is a consensus not
binding on local unions and
their membership unless they
accept it at their won General
Meetings." A t present it seems
that N U S proposals are accept-
ed at IC almost without ques-
tion, hence a change in our
constitution is i n order. A mo-
tion such as 'all matters relat-
ing to NUS policy should be
adopted at IC only after they
have been accepted by a quor-
ate UGM'. would ensure not
only debate of N U S p o l i c y as
it happens, but, in concentrat-
ing more power i n the IC U n i o n ,
create more interest i n our own
U G M s (any comments Mr
Teague?)
Now I must comment on N U S
demos. While Mr P h i l l i p s states
that 'public reaction on the
route of a march is in general
sympathetic or indifferent', the
obvious flaw in this argument
i s that most people are not on
the route of a march, but hear
about student demos through
the media, where they have
little a c c l a i m . Incidentally
yesterdays demonstration of
about 12,000 studens was com-
pletely overshadowed by the
tragic Moorgate disaster. In the
two papers I have read this
morning the demo got a total
of one photograph and four l i n -
es. I think to obtain public
support and at the same time
to p u b l i c i z e our cause we must
first separate university and
polytechnic students whose
aims are entirely different, and
recognise that a grants incre-
ase i s u s e l e s s if it means
solely an increase in the par-
ental contribution. I propose
an entirely different kind of
demo. It may be i d e a l i s t i c to
suggest, but I think 1000
students sitting on the pave-
ment outside Westminster, not
shouting, but reading and stud-
ying, would, by i t s shear ori-
ginality gain public sympathy
through the media.
F i n a l l y , I specualte as to
how Mr T . R a n d a l l would feel if
h i s union office were to be
occupied on the b a s i s of h i s
own proposals!
Y o u r s sincerely

Dear Sir,
It is with great trepidation
that I must comment on the
correspondence of our Jung
Freud and I hope a l l can en-
dure my a n a l y s i s .
However strong the l a d y ' s
views are, to take the pen
(phallic connatations not only
by shape but also by name)
and putting it to white paper
representing the virgin, and
then stroke i t back and forth
with a sustained rhythm until a
final climax is reached w i t h a
flourish, namely the signature
representing the need for
attention, a pointing out of a
sexual deprivation, can o n l y
be interpreted as a masturba-
tion fantasy of the first order.
Though for personal satisfac-,
tion. I would rather use a type-
writer.
May we a l l find our own
truth, securty and virtue.
