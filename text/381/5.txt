T H E C O L L E G E has 1147 places in H a l l s and Houses with
approximately 150 places in the area of Hamlet Gardens. T h e
applications for these places must be in by March 21st and you
may apply for either the F l a t s or the H a l l s / H o u s e s not both.
Now for some information about the various catagories by
which you may fall under if you are applying for residence.
1) . There are a number of places a v a i l a b l e for students want-
ing a second year in r e s i d e n c e . T h i s number is fixed at 12% of
the total number of places in the respective H a l l or House.
Hence if you want to be one of the lucky 12% get a form at the
beginning of March from the Residence Office, Room 161 C o l l e g e
Block .The s u c c e s s f u l reapplicants are chosen by a committee
consisting of students in that H a l l or House who are chosen by
the Warden according to his w i s h e s .
2) . 18% of the places in H a l l s and Houses are designated
for postgraduates. T h i s has been increased from 15% recently
as the demand for places has now increased to about six a p p l i -
cants to one place, (similarly for the reapplicants, up from 10%
to 12%). The extra 3% w i l l be accommodated entirely in the
H a l l s because the House Wardens have difficulty in getting
postgraduates in shared rooms. An important point which post-
graduates may not know is that any years in residence a s an
undergraduate are discounted and hence selection is random.
3) . There are forty medical or welfare/compassionate places
distributed throughout the H a l l s and Houses and the Student
Counsellor, Mr. Don Adlington together with D r . Grey nominate
students for these.
4) . Union places are for Union Officers who need to be near
College in order to carry out their duties normally . T h e s e stud-
ents are: President, Deputy President and Honorary Secretary
of ICU, the three C C U Presidents, Chairmen of S C C , R C C ,
A C C , A s s i s t a n t Secretary of A C C , President of ICWA, R C C
Transport Officer C a r n i v a l Coordinator, Nightline Cooordinator,
Editor of F E L I X , Entertainments Committee Chairman. There
are a l s o another four places at the command of the President of
I C U . Generally tow of these may go to the Rag Treasurer and
the Chairman of S C A B . A Union officer as above may have up
to and including a third year in residence, only the President,
Deputy President and Honorary Secretary of I C U may have a
fourth year in r e s i d e n c e . (Welfare and Medical/compassionate
places do not come under this ruling).
5) . There are 24 Wardens places in the H a l l s only, three per
H a l l , over w h i c h the Warden concerned has c o n t r o l . Staff mem-
bers may apply for these and their a p p l i c a t i o n s are considered
by the Wardens.
6) . A small number of places exist for U n i v e r s i t y Exchange
to accommodate v i s i t o r s .
7) . The remaining group of places are allocated to freshers
and s c h o l a r s . Half of the places in H a l l s and Houses are for
freshers who are nominated by their prospective department.
There are 35 places (included in the freshers places) for stud-
ents who obtain either a Royal or Entrance Scholarship w h i c h
carry the option of having the first year in residence. Ten V i c k -
ers scholars have as many years in residence a s they w i s h and
up to three Selkirk scholars have a place in Selkirk for their
scholarship period.
Here's a few s t a t i s t i c s for those who like them.

Hamlet Gardens and Cambridge Gardens
The flats in Hamlet Gardens and Cambridge Gardens in Ham-
mersmith and North Kensington are sub-let to students by the
C Y C L I N G
T H E B I C Y C L E , as a form
of transport, should be encour-
aged in urban areas. The fre-
quency of expression of sup-
port for c y c l i n g is increasing
and there is good reason be-
hind this support: as an econ-
omical means of daily trans-
port it is unrivalled. Those
who deplore the pollution and
waste of cars support the b i c -
y c l e as a viable alternative.
If you feel that, for any
reason whatever, you are suf-
ficiently motivated to register
a protest there w i l l be many
others of s i m i l a r mind gather-
ed on Saturday, March 8th .On
this day there is a 'Cycle-in'
at Richmond. T h i s hopes to
gain some consideration for
c y c l i s t s in the re-plannlng of
Richmond centre and a l s o to
p u b l i c i se the case of c y c l i s t s
as a whole. The 'Cycle-In'
starts on Richmond Green at
10.45am on Saturday (tomor-
row), it is organised by the
Barnes and Richmond group of
The Friends of the Earth.

Save L i g h t i n g and Imperial C o l l e g e Energy
College as head leasee. The Union picks the applicants for the
flats theoretically but in fact delegates this responsibility to
the Warden who in turn sleets the students in conjuntion with
the subwardens. The flats are in s i x e s , sevenses, eights with
4 x four and one three. Y o u stand a better chance of getting in
if you submit a group a p p l i c a t i o n . It is policy that students
wishing to have a second year in the flats have first choice of
which flat and get priority over first time a p p l i c a n t s . There are
no rules regarding maximum number of years in the flats, s i m i l -
arly residence in the flats does not count when applying for
H a l l s and H o u s e s . Freshers are not e l i g i b l e for residence in
the flats but married couples are.
