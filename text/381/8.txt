FRENCH TRIP 75
The task seems to have fallen to me to write this account, a s
everyone else who went on the trip seems to be suffering from
writer's cramp a t the moment, or perhaps they have a l l strained
their right arms lifting up a l l those bottles of wine!
The coach left IC Union
A r c h on Friday, 14th February,
at 9.30 am and w e headed for
Dover with a most competent
driver from Glasgow called
J o c k at the weheel who had
never been to P a r i s before in
his life.
Our first stop w a s at Cant-
erbury where a majority d e c i d -
ed they wanted to go to the
loo, only to find that the gents
was locked, s o nature being
what it i s , a large mixed queue
formed outside the ladies. D i d
we get some funny looks! We
arrived at Dover and the boat
left for Boulogne a t 2pm. It
was a French ship and the
snackbar had a w i d e range of
sandwiches - ham, ha or ham?
At 3.30pm w e reached B o u l -
ogne and then s e t off for P a r i s .
Just before B e a u v a i s (most of
us were feeling somewhat hun-
gry after those d e l i c i o u s ham
sandwiches) w e decided to
stop at a roadside cafe/bar.
We a l l entered the cafe creat-
ing absolute havoc . S i n c e only
12 were from I F , guess who
had to do a l l the ordering...
The Frenchie behind the bar
nearly fainted when I asked
for 27 plates of c h i p s ! Was he
relieved to s e e the back of u s !
We reached Paris at 11pm.
On Saturday morning w e
were taken by the French stu-
dents to their c o l l e g e to be
welcomed by Monsieur Strauss.
Then w e went off on a c o a c h -
tour of P a r i s with some of the
pare the two, Mooney's i s a
non-starter.
The evening w a s free and a
group of us went to Montparn-
a s s e , and on emerging from the
metro were promptly soaked in
the sudden down pour before
being able to find a c a f e . W e
dived into the first cafe that
would hold a l l 12 of us (it
turned out to be the dearest)
and once again created havoc .
However, we got our money's
worth in the end, because
someone decided to pinch the
D e b b i e P a r k e r
French'students acting a s
guides. A t about 1 o'clock we
returned to the college for a
celebration lunch. T h i s c o n -
s i s t e d of a fantastic spread of
food, flaming pancakes, and of
course, barrels of w i n e .
F e e l i n g considerably full
and somewhat affected by the
wine, we were free to occupy
ourselves a s w e pleased for
the afternoon. Supper w a s
takenat F . I . A . P . and I have
been assured that if you corn-
menu. T h e Latin Quarter w a s
our next target where we found
a nice Greek Tavern.
Sunday w e had lunch at the
C i t e U n i v e r s i t a i r e , and then
set off for V e r s a i l l e s for the
afternoon. Supper w a s at F . I .
A . P . and in the eveing the
French had booked us front
seats a t a F o l k l o r e D a n c e /
Show. A t first, we were a bit
s c e p t i c a l thinking it w a s a
ballet, however w e were sur-
prised when we found it w a s
not, and enjoyed it immensely,
e s p e c i a l l y when J . P . D . had to
present a bouquet of flowers to
a lady in the orchestra. Next
on the agenda w a s a tour of
P i g a l l e where the friver w a s
a l l for stopping off!
Monday morning we were
supposed to be at the college
at 9am, but needless to s a y ,
we were late. F i r s t we had a
welcome speech by the Direct-
or, then a speech by M.Strauss.
We had to leave P a r i s at 1
o'clock and made for Boulogne,
stopping off at a village on the
way to rid them of their stocks
of wine . There w a s a Force 8
gale on the C h a n n e l , and after
so much wine, a few looked
pretty green. But w e reached
IC in one piece at about 9 3 0
pm.
I think w e would a l l agree
that the French students were
very generous and patient with
us, and did a l l they could to
give us a good time, e s p e c i a l l y
the students of the E c o l e Nat-
i o n a l Superieure de Chimie
de P a r i s . So now it just re-
mains for me to s a y a s p e c i a l
thankyou to a l l those who
came and made it such an e n -
joyable trip, because without
you it would not have been
possible.
