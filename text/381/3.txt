O C C A S I O N A L L Y in our more c r i t i c a l moments w e may a s k
ourselves - what are we doing here, for what end, i s that end
worthwhile or interesting even? It w a s interesting to note the
packed lecture theatre in last w e e k ' s General Studies 'Horizon'
film "Science is dead - Long live science" o b v i o u s l y there is a
widespread concern and awar-
eness that a l l Is not 100%
rosy in the world of s c i e n c e
and technology. However,
these concerns tend not to
get expressed vociferously In
a c o l l e g e dedicated to the
s i n g l e minded training of s c i -
e n t i s t s and engineers without
encouraging us to a s k 'what
is it tor?' Thus the demarca-
tion between the " t w o c u l -
t u r e s " is maintained.
The IC Science for People
group (society for s o c i a l res-
ponsibility In science) e x i s t s
to provide a forum of d i s c u s -
s i o n on the i s s u e s of this i n -
teraction between s c i e n c e and
s o c i e t y . We do this by meet-
ing at lunchtime on Tuesdays
in Southside Upper lounge for
a drink (everyone welcome)
and inviting speakers of var-
ied renown to talk or lead a
d i s c u s s s i o n . T o s e e what w e '
ve been up to this year, w e
started with Dr.Jerry R a v e t z ,
historian and philosopher of
s c i e n c e , who maintained that
s c i e n c e was not neutral and
attempted to destroy the ideo-
logy of 'pure s c i e n c e ' .
T h i s term we invited Sir
Brian Flowers w h o talked on
s c i e n c e education and resear-
ch from the perspective of I C .
H e d i s c u s s e d the theme of
accountability of a s c i e n t i s t
as a n i n d i v i d u a l , to his em-
ployer, to the public good,
but refused to be drawn on the
v a l i d i t y of the various inter-
e s t s , and whether we had sat-
isfactory mechanisms of e n -
suring accountability - e s s e n -
t i a l l y a p o l i t i c a l process. H e
s a i d that means a r e techno-
l o g i c a l but that ends are pol-
i t i c a l ; thus s c i e n t i s t s ought
to be conversant in the s o c -
ial s c i e n c e s , s o they can con-
tribute to the debate over both
means and ends. H e hopes
c o u r s e s in " r e l e v a n t " s o c i a l
s c i e n c e s w i l l be introduced
at I C . However, he is adam-
ant that IC should not turn i n -
to another L S E . .I hope, per-
s o n a l l y , that he does not sup-
press necessary p o l i t i c a l
d i s c u s s i o n .
L a s t week, D a v i d D i c k s o n ,
s c i e n c e journalist and author
of " A l t e r n a t i v e T e c h n o l o g y " ,
presented h i s thesis that the
demarcation between techno-
logy and p o l i t i c s cannot be
maintained, i.e. the d e c i s i o n
to develop a technology, the
technology itself, and the
uses to which it is put, along
with the side effects, are i n -
extricably linked throgh the
structure of a given society.
A s for the rest of this term,
we hope to have Brain E a s -
lea, author of "Liberation
and the Aims of Science",
and Professor Bernard F e l d
from MIT, active in "Pug-
wash", and reputed to have
been on N i x o n ' s list of " e n e -
m i e s " , who w i l l d i s c u s s the
role of Non-super Powers who
nevertheless have nuclear
" c a p a b i l i t y " e.g. B r i t a i n ,
F r a n c e , Israel, India e t c .
