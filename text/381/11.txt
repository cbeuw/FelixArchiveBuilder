An early morning international was arranged against Buenos
A i r e s Rugby C l u b for Saturday l s t March. They arrived on time
but of course we didn't, (did we Terry?)
The game eventually started at 11.00am with our favourite
referee, Gordon, blowing the whistle (occasionally). I C burnt off
to a roaring start and w i t h i n
five minutes Hughes had snook
in near the comer flag for a
l s t X V v W e l s h G u a r d s
good team try. The Agentin-
i a n s fought back well and did
well to keep IC at bay for the
rest of the half and at half time
the match was evenly p o i s e d
with the score at 4 - 0 to I C .
F o r the third quarter the
match was again rather furious
and very even. T h e inexper-
ienced Argentinians frequendy
went unpunished when offside
in both ruck and maul. F r u s t -
ration was rife among the I C
forwards and some dirty play
was beginning to creep i n . The
stalemate was broken by a
Terry Fearn try. A movement
down the right w i n g moved i n -
side with Fatman i n support
and a badly timed pass found
F e a m who dived over to give
I C a convincing 8 - 0 lead.
The Argentinians came back
strongly with what can only be
described as over robust play.
After a maul in which the Arg-
entians were blatantly guilty
of off side A u s t i n took matters
into h i s own hands, so to
speak. Retribution was exacted
in the next scrum when A u s t i n
emerged with a bruised and cut
eye and was forced to retire.
Only ten minutes remained but
they were to be ten minutes of
misery for I C . Almost immed-
iately Buenos A i r e s ran i n for
an unconverted try. Shortly
afterwards poor tackling brou-
ght a well converted try by the
Argentinians and this was fol-
lowed by another goal in the
l a s t minute of the match. D i s -
appointingly IC had somehow
lost by 16 - 8.

For the second time this
season the brave stalwarts of
I C prepared to meet those vic-
ious supporters of peace and
learning - the Welsh Guards.
H a v i n g previously drawn again-
st a very lucky Guards side
(the referee has recently been
promoted for sawing h i s com-
rades honour), B r a d l e y ' s B o y s
looked forward to a more pro-
fitable result at Harlington.
T h e day started badly for
the B a n d i t s with the two chos-
en centres deciding to stay at
home for tea. R a p i d rearrange-
ments followed. B y 2.15 a full
side was present at Harlington
and watched a s ' A ' gave some
last minute instruction on how
to k i c k .
Three o ' c l o c k saw the
score at I C - 15 . Guards - 0 .
They s t i l l hadn't arrived. But
the sun was shining so the
team sat down to i c e d tea and
b u s c u i t s .
Within the hour the tumble
of a ten - ton truck (complete
with c a g e and Major) was
heard approaching.
Out of the truck climbed
twelve men and their captain,
Major. " S o r r y we're late
c h a p s " . " T h a t ' s O . K . , Major-
C a p t a i n " . Now to get changed.
K i c k - o f f was at 15.15 hun-
dred hours, so it w a s no sur-
prise that I C were tired from
the start. The Bandits burst
off to a vigorous start and
completely dominated the
Guard's X I I I i n both set and
l o o s e . R e s u l t s came rapidly
with Zapper running i n a fine
try from h i s own half after a
w e l l timed (?) p a s s from the
P o t . Unfortunately no conver-
s i o n .
B a c k in the front row,
A u s t i n was giving h i s opposite
number a veritable l e s s o n ,
who responded by k i c k i n g
young B o b ' s knees i n apprec-
i a t i o n .
R e a l i z i n g that they were i n
complete control, the I C pack
left the field for tea and b i s -
c u i t s . They clapped appreciat-
ively from the touchline as Mr
T . F e a r n (arrived on Time) in-
tercepted a pass and dashed
down the pitch to score a fine
try under the p o s t s . Try con-
verted by F o r b e s .
The Guards made a surprise
come-back while the pack c a l -
l e d for seconds. The score
was 10 - 6.
T h e p a c k was then forced to
return to the p i t c h . B u t no-one
was really interested anymore,
so the I C l s t X V beat the
pride of the B r i t i s h Army 10 -
6. N i c e one, Major-Captain.
Bradley played well again,
but needs to work harder at
his singing.

Z e a l a n d beware . . . ! The
cricketing a l l stars of the hoc-

the summer season . A r r i v i n g
at the B a n s ground early
(makes a change) we found no
opposition awaiting our arrival
and so took to the cricket f i e l d

E x t r a s : 2 no b a l l s (Hodge).
It w a s obvious from the
start that IC were going to w i n
as F a c t s had not supplied an
Umpire and consequently ac-
cording to L e a g u e R u l e s they
loose 5-0. D e s p i t e this easy
victory I C set out to prove
they were worthy of the two
points and playing up h i l l i n
the first half p r e s s u r i s e d the
B a r t s defence throughout with-
out actually scoring.
Congratulations a l l in order
for ' K i c k e r s ' H u t s i n who per-
formed a magnificent clearence
when c a l l e d upon to touch the

tact our out-of-work goalkeeper.
H a l f time arrived with the
score 0-0 and then shortly
afterwards, w h i l e I C were
s t i l l noshing oranges, B a r t s
scored from a well taken short
c o m e r . Motivated by this sur-
p r i s e goal I C swiftly struck
b a c k . What we had been threat-
ening to do i n the first h a l f we
did i n the second. Four goals
were scored in a l l , one a p i e c e

T h e only forward not to score

l s t X I v S i l v e r w i n g
L a s t Wednesday at Harling-
ton the l s t XI pub i n a rare
midweek appearance. Our first
mistake of the afternoon was
to arrive on time as Silverwing
d i d n ' t but eventually everyone
was ready for the b u l l y off.
Tje " F u h r e r " drew first blood
by winning the toss. I C start-
ed in their usual dynamic man-
ner and within five minutes
had taken the lead through
Sleepy who woke up first i n
time to put the b a l l i n the net
after a superb dummy by Super-
strap!! We soon went further
ahead when Superstrap bem-
used the Silverwing defence
with a b r i l l i a n t solo run before
scoring. H a l f time arrived with
I C in comfortable 2 - 0 lead.
Unfortunately, the second h a l f
contained a few unpleasant
incidents, notably when a S i l -
verwing defender decided to
rearrange the shape of Hopa-
l o n g ' s left knee cap c a u s i n g
him to take a brief rest. Super-
strap then decided to return the
compliment with the nett re-
sult that both he and the S i l v -
erwing defender were sent off
for five minutes (Nice one
Superstar!!) T h e s e incidents
tended to interrupt the flow of
the game and the match bec-
ame very scrappy until the
l a s t quarter of the game when
I C regained their rhythm. It
was in the period that I C scor-
ed their third goal. A beautiful
c l e a r a n c e by T i n Whisde found
Hotshot on the right wing and
although h i s c r o s s was h a l f
cleared the hockey c l u b ' s one
and only O . A . P . (complete
w i t h wheelchair) was on hand
to put the b a l l i n t o the vacant
g o a l .
T h i s was o n c e again a good
o v e r a l l team performance. T h e
defence was as sound a s ever
with P o p - B a b e having a very
steady game at left back. The
forwards created many chances
and only some b r i l l i a n t goal-
keeping prevented u s from
scoring more than three g o a l s .

M i x e d H o c k e y
On Sunday the Mixed
H o c k e y team congregated i n
the Union for the long awaited
G u i n e s s Match. On arriving at
the ground a hour early we
managed to get wet (It's the
rain you know) before the
match. In the first half I C
looked the better team and t i e
l e a d when Dave.(I can do i t
too!) hard pushed the b a l l
through their keepers l e g s . A n
amazing feat considering he
was playing without h i s pre
match pint (A great blow to
him) L a t e r i n this half T i m
M a r s h a l l h i t the post after a
b r i l l i a n t dribble (Inspired by
h i s spectator, No doubt) and
left Sarah Horn no problem in
scoring our second .Ignoring
the incidents at half time when
one of our spectators ran on to
the p i t c h , I shall pass on to
the second half. In this half
IC did not look so impressive
and were l u c k y to hang on to
their lead, and unbeaten re-
cord.
After the match came the
most important part of the day,
the F R E E G u i n n e s s and Harp
lagar, w h i c h T i m and Dave
consumed most of the day,
culminated with Dave (I feel
s i l l y H o l d i n g it) B a l d e r s o n
m a k i n g u s walk half a mile,
n e e d l e s s l y . Thanks to C h r i s
P a r k e r for putting up a good
performance as an umpire and
player.
