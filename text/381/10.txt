John Martyn: Concert in the Great Hall.
J O H N M A R T Y N was ably supported
by a consortium of musicians based around
T h e L u c a s and M c C u l l o h duo on a c c u s t i c
guitars. After a couple of numbers Includ-
ing Joni M i t c h e l l ' s "Yllow Taxi". They
were joined by Kenny - T h e - F i d d l e r
(from Slim Chance) whose playing at
times was amazing and always entertain-
ing. H i s piece "de resistance" was a â€¢
rendering of "The William Tell Overture"
on jewls harp - yes jew's harp! We were
treated to an encore of innuendo on group
manages.

"l w a s the only one who could handle
Daniel The Spaniel Superstar"
John Martyn kicked off with h i s oldie
"May you never" .No one can deny, J o h n ' s
ski II on guitar and clever use of mixing
and-echo. But his style does not have
universal appeal. H i s dry humour and be-
haviour o n s t a g e i s construed, by some,
to be arrogance, but having talked to him
I de not think this i s s o .
He has now introduced drums into
many of h i s songs, "Because I felt like
it". On the c l a s s i c "Bless The Weather",
I do not think they were entirely at home.
John was accompanied on Double bass,
a s ever, by the energetic Danny Thomp-
son, who excelled himself on this o c c a -
s i o n . F o r the last two numbers they were
joined by the legendary P a u l Kossoff,
who appeared to have been kicked out at
c l o s i n g time and just made it to the con-
cert. H e may have kept his fans happy
but this was not P a u l Kossoff at h i s v i n -
tage best.
For the dedicated Martyn fans this w a s
a concept to remember and for newcomers
to h i s music it was a good advertisement.
T h e audience was warm and in J o h n ' s
words, " A lot looser than the usual L o n i
don a u d i e n c e . " T h e support band, having
now finished this tour, are forming L u c a s
and M c C u l l o h ' s A l m a n a c . S o watch out
for them they could be worth it.
When asked what he was doing now,
P a u l Kassoff said he was getting a band
together this week, so keep an eye out
for that too .

David Gates: Never Let Her Go
(Polydor)
D A V I D G A T E S has that rare quality
which i s so often lacking in the pseud
arena of the contemporary rock s c e n e . It
is called finesse, and Gates has it run-
ning out of his talented ears. Listening
to Never Let Her Go i s to return with a
nostalgic sigh to the days when he was
the indispensable core of Bread, the soft-
rock sophistoes, who tragically disband-
ed some two years a g o .
Although it could never be said that
this album i s a stale pastiche of that
band, it is nevertheless true to say that
David Gates musical resources have re-
mained unflawed and unexpired. T h e
style is exactly the same; it i s simply
the orchestration that has undergone
slight modification.
Cuts like "Never let her go", "Part-
time 'love" and practically a l l of side
two leave me despairing a s to the v a l i d -
ity of hard rock showing its grotesque
(by comparison) face in public . A l r i g h t ,
alright. So maybe I'm an incurable roman-
tic - it is just that this viryl i s indisput-
ably one of the best around at the
moment.
Ralph McTell: Streets (Warner Bros.)
IT WAS inevitable after the s u c c e s s
of the single "Streets of London", that
Warner Bros, should follow it up with an
album of M c T e l l singing mainly h i s own
material and including, of course, the
original single a s bait. T h e venture as
such pays off handsomely: the talented
M c T e l l renders ample illustration of hi s
balladic versatility .
Mixed with tracks that are best des-
cribed a s "typically folk" are some sup-
erb ballads such a s "Grande Affaire",
"Pity the Boy" and "Lunar Lullaby"
which, far from being harmonically trite,
show a maturity of perspective which
transcends the normal run-of-the-mill folk
garbage.

The Valley (obscured by clouds) .
A s you may have guessed from the
second part of the title the musical score
of this film i s written and performed by
P i n k F l o y d , s o it starts with a point i n
its favour. T h e photography is excellent,
the actors are completely believable in
their roles, and the music blends super-
bly into the action. However, despite a l l
this, "The Valley" is for me a slight
disappointment. T h e theme lacks immed-
iacy and at times the pace f l a g s . If it is
tryiug to put over a message it eludes my
g r a s p .
Briefly the plot concerns a French
woman who is initially in New Guinea to
procure Bird of Paradise feathers but be-
comes involved with a hippy (not too
cliche) expedition in search of the valley
of the title, which is a blank o n the map
being obscured by clouds. F i l m e d on loc-
ation the actors mingle with unrehearsed
natives of the Mapuga tribe during the
story, before they continue their guest.
The ending was the type I hate -
i n c o n c l u s i v e .
The part that s t i c k s in my mind (besid-
es the q u i c k erotic bits) is the opening
photography to the accompaniment of P i n k
F l o y d . Not a film to see for the story; but
worth catching for its a r t i s t i c quality.

Peter Fonda, Susan George: Dirty
Mary Crazy Larry (20th Century Fox,
Director: John Hough)
THIS F I L M is a reasonably mediocre
attempt to entertain the audience with a
s u c c e s s i o n of motor car stunts and little
else. T h e attempt fails dismally .
Peter Fonda of "Easy Rider" fame
plays ' C r a z y Larry,', a speed freak with
ambitions for big-time motor racing. With
his side - kick mechanic, Deke (Adam
Rourke), he picks up with 'Dirty Mary'
(Susan George), who by a l l accounts is a
whore, but this aspect is never illustrated
(sexist! - Ed.). After having robbed a .
supermarket cash office, the rest of the
film is devoted to the police chase that
ensues. Whilst the plot is a bore, the sub-
plots had a lot of potential. P i t y that they
were left open ended and never exploited.
A l l the car stunts have been done be-
fore; there i s a sprinkling of four letter
words, hence the X - certificate; a l l in a l l ,
this film i s one that w i l l only appeal tcr
car-chase addicts.
J o h n A n d r e w s
Thomas Pynchon: Gravity's Rainbow
(Pacador).
T h i s i s a mammoth piece of work not
only in volume, and to be able to swallow
it a l l in one helping would require a per-
ceptive mind the like of which is not often
found amongst s c i e n t i s t s , or most other
species of mortals .
One reviewer of this book said that most
other novels are really a bit trivial when
compared to this, and he was right . M r
P y n c h o n ' s imagination i s matched only by
his talent a s a writer; into this bubbling
cauldron of a book he throws sex, biology,
war psychology, love, organic chemistry,
humour... I could add a lot more .It is often
erotic, often very funny (sometimes at the
same time); it a l s o has its moments of s a d -
ness and serious comment.

Facts in Focus
The book is compiled by the Central
S t a t i s t i c a l office and is essentially a
summary of the more Important s t a t i s t i c a l
figures In paperback for the mere pltance
of 6 0 p A wide range of topics are looked
at with data on E E C countries and a few
comparisons with the major industrialised
countries such a s the U S A . F o r those i n -
terested In public affairs of any sort it
ought to be a useful guide for more Infor-
med debate, especialy at U G M s e t c .

Eric Ambler: The Levanter
' Y E T A N O T H E R T H R I L L E R ' from
E r i c Ambler who i s however very good at
writing them the result in this case being
atmospheric with a good complex plot and
a twist or two thrown in for good measure.-
Set in the Middle E a s t this i s based
around one central character Michael How-
e l l , 'The Levanter' and his involvment -
a l l but unwilling - in Arab - Israeli guer-
illa action in a plot to overthrow Israel.
Once got into, this is a hard book to
put down and that is what a thriller i s
supposed to do - s o take it a s good for
straight entertainment value, without per-
haps the metaphysics or descriptiveness
of a novel, which i s the style of book I
