W i f O i t M L M i c h a e l W i l l i a m s
T H E P A S T week or so has seen the
annual indulgent spectacle o f Union
e l e c t i o n s . Noticeboards, w a l l s , w i n d -
ows, doors - anything i n fact, that w i l l
hold a drawing pin or sellotape - have
a l l been defiled by a multitude of post-
ers and bumph, each and everyone
screaming out for attention. B o l d words
have been spoken, promises have been
made. The o l d chestnut of student
apathy and U G M attendances have been
given their perfunctory a i r i n g s . P u b -
licity machines have been furiously
grinding out the pearls of wisdom, the
hopeful messages and adherent c l i c h e s .
What will come of it all? A t the time
of writing, (Wednesday afternoon) i t i s
not at a l l certain that the I C U elections
w i l l be quorate. A threshold of about
1050 voters is necessary to make the
elections v a l i d - i f the threshold i s not
reached, new elections w i l l have to be
held, new slogans w i l l have to be
thought up, candidates w i l l be c a l l e d
upon to make even greater efforts with
their campaigning.
Naturally, i f the elections are quo-
rate, then let u s congratulate the vict-
ors and commisurate with the not-so-
lucky . B u t if the elections are deemed
i n v a l i d , then some people are going to
have to do a lot of hard thinking with
regard to their future.
The demonstration for fairer grants
last F r i d a y appears to have been a suc-
cess. A 15,000 turn-out nevertheless be
remembered that there were Welsh and
seen in the perspective o f the fact that
Welsh and Scottish demos were being
held simultaneously can only rate as a
success i n terms of participation. The
turn-out from I C was 50% higher than
that recorded for the l a s t demo: a new
s e s s i o n a l high of sixty students. Trev.
P h i l l i p s was extremely disappointed,
and justifyably so.
The question now being asked i s >
How many of those who have recently
stood up and endorsed the fighting of
the proposed education cuts were on
that demo?
More developments next week.

Dear Sir,
M s . L i s t z ' s a n a l y s i s of pin-
ball as an outlet of repressed
sexual impulses i s essentially
correct. Of course, minor points
are open to d i s p u t e . S h e does
not explain the deep satisfied
c l i c k s and shirrs the machine
makes when a ball i s l o s t down
the hole. Furthermore, my per-
sonal s k i l l (or lack of s k i l l ) is
such that I never get a replay.
T h i s does not mean that I de-
rive no satisfaction from the
game.However, let us not ar-
gue on t e c h n i c a l i t i e s .
In her c o n c l u s i o n , M s . L i s t z
condemns "sex substitutes"
such as the p h a l l i c pinball
machine, Theta, and the Que-
en's T o w e r . May I point out
that there i s a sex ratio of 10:
1 i n I . C . clearly, some substit-
ute i s more glorious, more maj-
e s t i c , more ...imperial than the
noble art of pinball?

Dear Mr Williams
I am writing to you to pro-
test about the p u l l i n g down of
posters around C o l l e g e at
Union E l e c t i o n times. It i s
oommon practice of the soc-
ieties at Imperial C o l l e g e that
no posters put up by other
societies advertising future
events are p u l l e d down, but
those which are out of date
can be. Although C o l l e g e U n i -
on pays for the posters through
S C C / R C C , they are s t i l l ex-
pensive and account for a
reasonable percentage of the
societies annual grant from the
Union.
On Monday (February 24th)
two posters were p l a c e d i n the
J C R near the door, and o n Tue-
sday (February 25th) they had
been replaced by a poster of a
person standing for a U n i o n
office. There were many blank
sections of w a l l where this
poster could have been p l a c e d
but they were not well p o s i -
tioned .
If everyone practised this
habit, NO POSTERS would re-
main up for more than a few
hours, and no-one would know
i f any meetings of interest to
him or her were occuring that
lunch t i m e .
I appeal to people to stop
this habit of p u l l i n g down
posters around College.

Dear Mike,
It seems I gravely misre-
presented the G l i d i n g C l u b at
the hustings on Thursday when
I stated that they had a grant
of approximately £1000 and
only 20 members. I have since
discovered that their grant is
only £750 and that they have a
membership of over 70 p e o p l e .
I w i s h to publicly apologise
to the G l i d i n g C l u b and hope
that my mistake does not jeop-
ardise their grant for next year.
Yours sincerely,
Malcolm Spencer

Dear Sir,
Imperial College
In the event of Mooney be-
coming even more expensive, I
feel sure that the majority of
I.C. students w i l l stop u s i n g
the refectories, causing yet
another increase i n prices due
to a decrease i n takings. Not
only is the standard of food
low, but a l s o that of service .
T o quote but one example;
on Thursday l a s t I went down
to the Union Refectory at 3pm
in the hope of buying a late
lunch. Having entered the re-
fectory I was hustled out to
cries of "closed for lunch,
open in half an hour," althou-
gh the signs clearly state that
the lower union refectory i s
open from 11 30am until 5.
55pm . When I returned at 3 30,
I was served w i t h c h i p s that
had obviously been fried before
the refectory had been closed,
and by this time were greasy
and c o l d .
T h i s i s not the fault of the
staff; however, may I suggest
that were this a commercial
enterprise, the manager would
cover while staff had their own
meals. May I a l s o suggest
that, if the refectories faced
reasonable competiton, a n d did
not have a 'captive c l i e n t e l l e '
they would have to improve
their standards or close. No-
one would mind paying higher
prices, to eat i n reasonable
surroundings and be served
with palatable food.
Y o u r s sincerely,
D.West.

Something was said at the
U G M on the 27th February that
annoyed me, and certainly
have angered members of the
Imperial College G l i d i n g C l u b .
T h i s was the statement by Mr
M.Spencer, a candidate for the
post of I C U Hon. Sec. i n reply
to a question, that in the event
of the U n i o n ' s budget being
cut, he would rather see s e l -
ective cuts i n minority inter-
est c l u b s , eg. G l i d i n g C l u b
which estimates over £1000
for next year for only twenty
members. Apart from being mis-
leading this raises a number of
