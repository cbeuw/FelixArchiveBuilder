FELIX
J PREC3 P3CE
A number of students have recently
asked me to explain some of the factors
concerned with my nomination to a vice-
presidency of the N U S , and what I intend
to do. Perhaps I can take a short while
here to clarify my position.
F i r s t , the mechanics: as President of
U L U I w i l l be a sabbatical officer of
U L U ; as a vice-president of N U S I would
not be s a b b a t i c a l . There are, in fact only
four full-time officers of the N U S - Pre-
sident, Deputy President, Secretary, and
Treasurer. The obvious reason for this i s
that the National E x e c u t i v e dominated,
notby full-timers based in E n d s l e i g h
Street but by "ordinary s t u d e n t s " , and
sabbetical officers in direct touch w i t h
student needs. That way the E x e c u t i v e
i s not isolated from the student body it-
self.
The second point concerns my own
registration. I am standing for election as
a student of Imperial College. I am flat-
tered that so many people have indicated
.that they w o u l d w i s h me to remain a
student of I C (nominally, at least) for
the next year. I should point out that my
only reservation was whether this would
be acceptable to the College; my alleg-
iances, as a student, have always been
to I C , even when the U n i o n has taken
reactionary backward positions which i n
my opinion, acted against its own inter-
e s t s . They remain so. With regard to L S E
their reputation i s an undeserved one,
and my interest was i n terms of a course
of study, not bashing in the gates, or the
Director.
*
The other major point i s the fact that
1 am standing as the candidate of the
Broad Left. P e o p l e have a s k e d me what
the Broad Left i s , and why I am part of i t .
The space allowed here i s not enough to
outline this fully, but I w i l l try to give
some ideas about the nature of the Broad
Left in a few paragraphs.
E s s e n t i a l l y , the B L i s an alliance of
students - L e f t Labour (mostly from the
" C l a u s e 4 " group, w h i c h identifies
with the Tribune group of M P * s), Comm-
u n i s t s , and non-aligned s o c i a l i s t s l i k e
myself. We take part i n that a l l i a n c e be-
cause we have a broadly s i m i l a r concep-
tion of the role of students i n today's
Most people at IC have now heard of the
newly formed "Women in Science" group
without knowing why it e x i s t s and what
are its a i m s . There seems to have been
a lot of misrepresentation as we have
been branded p o l i t c a l , women's libbers
who are out to destroy ICWA THIS IS
N O N S E N S E as anyone who has had any-
thing to do with the group knows.
"Women in Science" e x i s t s to promote
interest in s c i e n c e among women, to en-
courage more women into s c i e n c e , to i n -
vestigate any prejudice against women
s c i e n t i s t s and to study the attitude of
scientific research towards women.
When a group was started at IC the
aims of the group were formulated on two
levels, women in s c i e n c e generally and
society. The B r o a d Left tries to put for-
ward p o l i c i e s that the mass of students
c a n identi y with and unite b e h i n d , i n
fighting to defend their educational and
l i v i n g standards - thus the aim of b u i l d -
ing strong student unions w h i c h c a n fight
on questions l i k e Grants, education cuts,
and housing.
A l l students within the B r o a d L e f t see
the interests of students as being l i n k e d
to those of working people, because it i s
not only students who suffer from a l a c k
of educational provision, or of accommo-
dation .Therefore, we cannot operate i n -
dependantly of those working people or
find separate solutions to the problems.
A s a member of the B L , I feel that stud-
ent unions should tackle these problems
alongside the organisations of working
people - the Trades U n i o n s . T h i s goes
both for national and l o c a l l e v e l s .
I kbow that it i s sometimes difficult
for students to distinguish between dif-
ferent " l e f t y " groups. However, I would
say that we differ from the other major
leftwing group, the Ultra-left, as s i g r -
ificantly as we differ from the Right i n
student unions . The Ultra-left do not be-
lieve that i t i s worthwhile fighting on
"student q u e s t i o n s " or trying to unite
most students on particular i s s u e s . They
would rather try to win a small number of
students directly to "revolutionary soc-
i a l i s m " , an approach which we stra n^ty
reject, for this only results i n d i v i d i n g
students, i n alienation, i n students being
" p i s s e d off" with the U n i o n , and apathy.
The Right w i n g (as exemplified by
R A G , the L i b e r a l s , and the Tories) i n .
student unions e s s e n t i a l l y attempt to do
much the same - divide students, weaken
student unions as campaigning bodies, to
generate a " d o - n o t h i n g " atmosphere. T h e
fact that the U l t r a - Left and R i g h t often
team up, as at L S E recently .where they
tried to d i s c r e d i t the U n i o n , by setting
ludicrous demands, and c a l l i n g for tact-
i c s w h i c h were totally u n r e a l i s t i c in that
situation (ultimation to the Director,
occupations, etc) shows how interested
they are in students' welfare.
Fundamentally, I see the B r o a d L e f t
a s an organisation which w i l l try to unite
students i n fighting in their won interests
K a r e n G a d d
women in s c i e n c e at IC . T h i s lead to
d i s c u s s i o n s about s o c i a l welfare of the
women at IC and we a l l agreed that there
is a lot to be done not only for the women
but for everyone here and that the women
in s c i e n c e group is as good a starting
place a s a n y . With this in mind the organ-
isation of a "Flatshare" centre is being
undertaken and should start work next
term. Other s o c i a l welfare campaigns for
improvement of the health centre, and the
provision of family planning service are
being d i s c u s s e d and it is hoped that we
w i l l get widespread support from people
at IC who are outside our group.
The a i m s of "Women in Science" are
being outlined and emphasised by the
organisation of lectures and debates, the
Trevor Phillips
- and i n the present situation, the inter-
ests of the education sector as a whole;
one w h i c h c a n provide the i n d of leader-
ship that the N U S (and student unions)
needs. That i s why I stand as a Broad
L e f t candidate

After a l l the talk of "free s p e e c h "
lately I would l i k e to point to what I
regard a s a real limitation on the free
speech of some Union members. I refer
to students who belong to the Services.
Many of these students feel that they c a n -
not take part i n " p o l i t i c a l " activity a s
students, because of p o s s i b l e repercus-
sions on their careers i n the Services.
E v e n the N a t i o n a l Demo was considered
" t o o m u c h " for them.
I consider this a scandalous situation.
Whether these students ate " r i g h t " or
" l e f t " , they should be allowed to speak
out on i s s u e s , just as much as any other
member of the Union and take part in act-
ivity open to other students.
The sooner the Services stop pretend-
i n g that soldiers, etc. are machines and
realise that they are human beings with
v i e w s the better it w i l l be for them.

first of which took place last week and
was very s u c c e s s f u l . It attracted women
from other London C o l l e g e s , fifth and
sixth formers and some women who have
made their careers in science and engin-
eering.
The "Women in S c i e n c e " group at IC
is organising surveys to study attitudes
towards girls who apply for industrial
sponsorships, and the attitudes third
year female students face at interviews
for j o b s . In both of these, incidences of
blatent discrimination have been reveal-
ed, how widespread is the prejudice, and
it w h i c h areas it most frequently occurs.
I consider it important that we emph-
a s i s e that we are a non-political group,
that we consider our aims sensible and
important. Anyone who d i s m i s s e s us as
"just more Women's Lib" is c l e a r l y i n -
capable of considering any moves again-
st injustice and intolerance as worth -
w h i l e . We welcome A N Y O N E who wishes
to attend our meetings w h i c h are held
Wednesday lunchtimes in the ICWA
lounge - if you are interested in our
group or any one of the aims of our group,
come along to a meeting and bring any
i d e a s .
