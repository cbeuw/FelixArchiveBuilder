A T L A S T "Davy" is back home in Mines ! H i s 53 day advent-
ure into the outside world ended last Friday when he was returned
to h i s custodians and once again took up residence in the RSM
b u i l d i n g .
During the months that
followed the disappearance of
"Davy", relations became
strained as s u c c e s s i v e comm-
unications from the Doctor and
the G u i l d s Union consistantly
contradicted earlier communi-
ques . Of one thing there was
little doubt: The 'Doctor' and
his organisation were a force
to be reckoned with and affor-
ded every respect.
The waiting game is apt to
bore men of action so, while
the RSM Union played out the
official wrangling, its members
set to work with a variety of
plots. Most came to nothing
but one, the bugging of the
C & C U office, bore fruit and
fuel for the RSM "peep soc".
Names could not always be
linked with voices, conseque-
ntly we are s t i l l wondering who
it was, on the eve of the
G u i l d s ' D i n n e r & Dance, who
warned Jenny Jones, "You'll
have to keep your legs together
tomorrow night, Jenny"!
Amusement was never e n d i n g .
I hardly believed my ears, as
I was taking my turn on watch,
to find myself in the middle of
a G u i l d s ' Committee meeting,
hearing for the first time
acknowledgements from Mr
Barnes of the superiority of
Mines. C l e a r l y the RSM 'Brain
Cell' cannot be so bad after
a l l , for openly and unashamed-
ly the V P of G u i l d s was
poaching on our Initiatives,
g i v i n g fact to the feeling that

Dave?? By comparison, GuiIds
illegal attempt at radio trans-
missions from the RSMU office
was brief and u n s u c c e s s f u l .
The G u i l d s ' offer to s e l l
Davy to the Camborne School
of Mines was made on January
28th, before any conditions
were offered to us, and a copy
of the letter was received by
me on Thursday, 30th. From

R.I.Z.S. S h a k i r ( p r o p , by N . J . P a y n e )
I have been at IC for two years and though I did not take active part
in the Union in my first y e a r ! remained interested enough to know what
went on and how the Union works. I did however take as full a part as
1 could in hall (weeks) life and helped m the running and organising of
social events. I have also done this in Garden Hall but due to committ-
ments to F E L I X these activities have been limited.
My duties as Features Editor took me to College Block (especially
in connection with producing the careers supplement) and as a result,)
now know how the administration is run and who runs it. In the course
of this it has become crystal clear to me that a gulf exists between the
students and College Block. This gap must be bridged and one way of
so doing will be for me to arrange talks (by the C B officials) and ques-
tion and answer sessions where students could meet these people and
express their views.
The D P (thro' the House Committee) is responsible for the Union
facilities. In addition to upholstering of the furniture and the possibil-
ity of fitting a cord carpet in the lounge bar (which is already being
looked at), I intend to make the refectories much more aethetically
appealing and also to ensure a high standard of cleanliness and hy-
giene. I would also like to see some repairs carried out in the gymnas-
ium.
If I am DP next year I shall be available A L L of the time. This will
help me to represent your views more accurately thus making it poss-
ible for the union to do what Y O U WANT IT TO, F O R Y O U R B E N E F I T .
I think I have the ability to negotiate which will help me when I am
representing you on the various committees. Finally I will ask you to
vote for me AND please V O T E .
M , F . K e s s l e r (prop, by R. A r g e n t !
As I see it, the job of Deputy President is split into three main parts
1, Maintaining the Union Areas 2. Representing the Union on var-
ious College committees and 3. Some general Union Administration
i.e. Union Meetings, committees, including Council. I feel that during
my time at College, I have gained sufficient experience to enable me to
cope with all aspects of the D.P.'s job. As a C C U V P , I have learnt
about Union Meetings the hard way, from the front, I have sat on many
committees and learnt how to handle the prolonged wrangling that most
committees call discusssion. I have been to many Council meetings
and, also, have made myself known all over College. This w.il be use-
ful as DP for although the Deputy President's job is not primarily soc-
ial, it is important for him to be widely known. This is particularly so
in connection with running the Union Building because if anything needs
repair it is much easier to find someone you know than just a D P .
Over the last few years, the function of many rooms in the Union
Building has changed and most of the furniture has been replaced or
renovated and so, next year, the emphasis must change from renewing
to redecoration and furnishing each room to suit its purpose, eg the T V
room could do with dimmer lighting. " M i k e " has been back at College
for about a year and I would like it put on permanent display - if ade-
guate security can be arranged - so, if elected I would do all I can to
build a secure plinth so everyone can 3ee our mascot.
I seem to have to the end of my 300 words, so to sum up, I want to
vote for me because I have (I think) the knowledge and experience to do
the DP's job successfully.
Union Resources Working Party
I C U C o u n c i l set up a working party with the following terms of
reference:
"To examine the workings of the Felix Office and the Union Cen-
ral Administration and to report on the options open to the Union
in the deployment of its resources in and between these areas".
The comments of Union Members are urgently sought. P l e a s e
send them to the Honorary Secretary, Union Resource Working
Party, c/o Union Office.
the depths of the RSM building
the seed of the idea sprang
into life and the printing press-
es clattered into a c t i o n . We
knew by then that Camborne
had received the offer and were
shortly to submit a bid. By
submitting an earlier reply,
there was a chance that we may
have succeeded in posing as
Camborne.
A s the headed notepaper
spun off the press, the problem
of beating the Camborne reply
pressed even harder on our
minds. S t i l l , we did i t . Typed,
signed, sealed, postmarked and
d e l i v e r e d , all on Friday morn-
ing! The rest was reported in
F E L I X . A l a s , the letter was
not opened until Monday at the
same time as the real reply.
By then our bug had been d i s -
covered and so we were in the
dark. The rest was my own
f a u l t ! We decided that to play
it through could do no harm.
Unfortunately the idea of such
a good replica had not occurred
to me !
The RSMU Committee d e c -
ided that the time had come to
submit. The Doctor's organ-
isation had won our respect.
The G u i l d s ' conditions were
delivered to us and they were
agreed in substance on 13th
February though later they
were to find that their words
had been rather loose.
F i r s t we were told one thi-
ng and then another, but
finally the date for the Davy
handover was fixed. 1.00 p.m.
Beit quad, February 28th. A
large crowd of spectators had
assembled in the quad, w h i l s t
in the bar last minute checks
were in progress to make sure
that the Davy bearers had the
requisit swimming trunks and
G u i l d s slopp shirts. P a n i c
struck a s 1 o ' c l o c k drew near-
er on the realisation that one
of the bearers was still without
a shirt. Many apologies to
R i c h Gundersen for waylaying
him in the quad and swiping
his s h i r t !
The RSMU contingent e n t -
ered nonchalantly from Beit
archway only to stand waiting
w h i l e Dru tried to make h i s
beer damped fireworks go bang
He finally succeeded in i g n i t -
ing a dry banger and as if by
magic, Jenny Jones material -
Ised through the billowing
smoke to enquire of the RSMU
bearers why they were not
wearing G u i l d s ' slopp shirts
and swimming trunks. She had
unfortunately forgotten to tell
us they had to showing !!
T o an earsplitting shout by
Mines, Davy appeared from
B e i t H a l l newly painted In
blue and red. Q u i c k l y it was
checked and then escorted
without further delay to the
new home In Mines, w h i l e
G u i l d s performed a boomalaker.
T h e anticlimax was complete !
In the final a n a l y s i s , Mines
lost the battle but won the war.
We lost little more than a mas-
cot. True enough, G u i l d s took
£150 of our Rag money, but to
the s i x t y people who collected
£720 to get Davy back, it was
a drop In the ocean. Our pride
was only slightly dented, our
heads were never bowed In
shame. But what did Gui Ids
l o s e ? They lost the chance to
make us do these things and
one chance was a l l they had.
One chance is all the RSM
will give anyone!
M i n i M y s t e r y
O N S A T U R D A Y afternoon a
mini was seen to be parked o n
the grass i n the B e i t quad
minding its own b u s i n e s s . No
one seemed to know who it
belonged to why i t was there
but no one seemed to be un-
duely concerned .
However, later that day at
about 11.30 pm the mini was
standing i n the union door with
its rear bumper against the
inner swing doors, a s if trying
to get into the building .
Apparently, about 60 people
making their way home from
the bar put the mini in this
somewhat unusual p l a c e and
quitely slipped away. Sub-
sequently it w a s extracted and
removed to P r i n c e Consort
Road by Dram soc. members,
who had been working l a t e .
