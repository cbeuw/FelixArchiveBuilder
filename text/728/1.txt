Keep The Cat Free
IC Union is supporting FELIX
Editor Hugh Southey in an
effort to disuade College
administration from
implementing plans to move the
FELIX office. Mr Southey
presented a paper detailing
problems associated with the
proposed move at a meeting
with College Secretary John
Smith and Union President Carl
Burgess last Friday. A motion
expressing support for Mr
Southey's response to the
College authorities was passed
without objection at Monday's
meeting of IC Union Council.
Mr B u r g e s s was first informed
of the plans for a FELIX move in
a meeting with M r Smith and
the Rector two weeks ago. M r
Smith intends to give the
Biology Department control of
the present F E L I X Office a n d
the Beit Hall T V L o u n g e . In a
letter to M r B u r g e s s three days
after the meeting M r Smith said
that C o l l e g e was planning to
refurbish the derelict kitchen
area behind the L o u n g e to
provide new offices for FELIX,
and an additional double room
and a new T V L o u n g e for Beit
Hall. Before meeting M r
Burgess and M r Southey on
Friday, M r Smith admitted that
Hugh Southey and J Martin Taylor
there w a s insufficent s p a c e
available for all these needs.
Mr Southey's paper listed
several major difficulties
associated with the move of the
F E L I X office. Significant
structual alterations would be
needed to the north side of Beit
Q u a d in order to move and
house the larger and more
delicate pieces of F E L I X
equipment. In addition there
w o u l d be a great deal of work
required in order to make the
derelict area suitable for the
production of FELIX. M r
S o u t h e y also stressed that the
position of the F E L I X office w a s
of prime importance since
student involvement was 'the
London Student
Attacked
A motion which would have
closed L o n d o n Student, the
L o n d o n - w i d e newspaper for
students, was defeated by only
two votes at the meeting of the
University of L o n d o n G e n e r a l
U n i o n C o u n c i l on T u e s d a y . IC
U n i o n buys 250 copies of
L o n d o n Student w h i c h are
distributed free from outside the
FELIX Office.
T h e delegation from the
L o n d o n S c h o o l of E c o n o m i c s ,
w h o proposed the motion,
c o m p l a i n e d that an issue last
term headlined ' S c h o o l for
Drugs' gave the false
impression that L S E had a
major drugs problem and that
hard and soft drugs were freely
available. T h e y said that since
the publication of the article,
L S E had received several visits
by the Drugs S q u a d . T h e L S E
Delegation wanted a front page
right-of-reply, a n d felt that if
this was not forthcoming U L U
should withhold funds from the
paper until the Editor, Miss
J o a n n e T o c h , either resigned or
finished her term of office.
Miss T o c h had offered L S E a
s p a c e for reply but reserved the
right to decide where to print it.
S h e also pointed out that the
paper was for students at
L o n d o n ' s P o l y t e c h n i c s a n d
Further E d u c a t i o n C o l l e g e s a n d
that it w a s 'elitist' for U L U to
attempt to force its policy onto
the paper. During the meeting
the L S E delegation were
threatened with expulsion for
unruly behaviour. At o n e point
the chairperson, D u a n e
P a s s m a n , walked out.
Of the I C U delegation eight
voted against the L S E motion
and one abstained. After the
meeting Miss J o a n n e T o c h said
that although she resented the
allegations made by L S E about
her professionalism made by
L S E s h e was still prepared to
print a reply to ' S c h o o l for
Drugs' in the next issue.
Alarmed about the move
life blood of a student
newspaper'. H e felt that to move
the office to s u c h a remote
position would be to the
unavoidable detriment of F E L I X
and everyone in C o l l e g e . A
further problem w a s that the
area available c o u l d not be
utilised s o as to provide
adequate office space.
M r Southey's paper suggested
that it would be more sensible
for the B i o l o g y Department to
make use of the kitchen areas
for the office s p a c e w h i c h they
required. M r Smith w a s
sympathetic towards M r
Southey's c o m m e n t s , but felt
that, if B i o l o g y took over the
kitchen area, they might at a
future date attempt to gain
control of more of the north
side of Beith Q u a d . H e agreed
that there would be significcant
problems if a move of the F E L I X
office were attempted, a n d said
that he would look into the
costs involved in greater detail.
He added that he was prepared
to put resources into the
development of the west
staircase of the U n i o n Building.
W h e n C o u n c i l met on
M o n d a y there w a s s o m e
support for a move of the F E L I X
office although M r S o u t h e y a n d
F E L I X B u s i n e s s M a n a g e r J
Martin T a y l o r confirmed the
inadequacies of the s c h e m e s
proposed. Deputy President
Dave Kingston adhered to the
view that to move the office
would strengthen the Union's
position by securing control of
the whole of the north side of
the U n i o n Building. Civil
Engineering D e p R e p Victor
Freeney argued that it w a s
unecessary to move the F E L I X
office and that the kitchen areas
would be more sensibly used as
offices for the Biology
Department. H e did not feel that
having full U n i o n control of o n e
side of the Q u a d would prevent
B i o l o g y from trying to takover
U n i o n rooms in future.
Mr B u r g e s s and M r S o u t h e y
will be meeting the C o l l e g e
Secretary later today to d i s c u s s
the matter further.
