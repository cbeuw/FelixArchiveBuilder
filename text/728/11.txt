battle. T h e captain spoke.
'Bad news., one of the
team didn't make it'.
It was true, A p e was not
there, taken out before the
race even started. Just as
g l o o m was d e s c e n d i n g on
the team A n d r e a took
control.
'Ape would not want us
to be like this. Let's win this
for him!'
Motivation now reached
new heights. O u r mission
was simple-win.
Battle c o m m e n c e d and
IC set off with an
impressive start. However,
this was to be no walk
over-Bristol were out for
blood. Pete and Helen
s h o w e d s o m e impressive
boathandling, but this
match was going to require
more than simply g o o d
sailing. Phil had the
answer.
' P s c h o l o g i c a l warfare is
needed; we must remove
their confidence.'
The team looked puzzled,
but they had learnt to have
respect for the
C o m m o d o r e ' s ideas. W h e n
the plan was revealed
though, it was stunning
both in its ingenuity a n d
simplicity. We would get
Bristol to carry out their
o w n destruction.
T h e next race Caroline,
with brilliant judgement,
manouvered one of the
Bristol men to the position
we wanted so that he
ensured the opposition's
defeat in a crucial race.
As the day turned to
dusk, the team came
ashore-exhausted but
satisfied that a g o o d job
had been done. S a m
s u m m e d it up.
'This has been a tough
day but by g o o d team work
and a sense of purpose, we
did what we c a m e here for.'
The team nodded their
heads; they had done it for
Ape.
Cycling
What better way to shake
off the effects of Saturday
night than a nice, gentle
bike ride? This S u n d a y we
went to Staines. Due to a
strong headwind and a
small amount of rain, we
sheltered in M a c D o n a l d s in
Staines. Suitably (?)
refreshed, we w o u n d our
way back, greatly aided by
the wind, arriving in S o u t h
Kensington shortly before
1 pm.
S u n d a y rides start from
Beit A r c h at 10am. Bring
s o m e money for food and a
railcard (if you've got one)

something too ambitious!

shorter ride starting from

Model Aircraft
C o m m a n d e r J a m e s o n
looked over the control of
the newly-equipped I C M A C
A R T F . He had spent the
last of the R C C Budget on
a new Fleet radio system,
e n o u g h nitro to get home,
a military laser and there
was a tonne of arcturian
megaweed in the cargo
bay. He pressed the launch
button and sat back as the
A R T F accelerated out of
the e s c a p e tube.
T h e G a l c o p Vipers had
amassed around the exit of
the Coriolis s p a c e station-a
d a n g e r o u s drugs trafficker
was hiding inside and was
expected to escape at any
time. The distinctive hum of
the 0525 b e c a m e louder
over the world data link.
B a n k s of pulse lasers
glowed in anticipation as
missiles slowly lowered
from the bellies of the
Vipers, primed and fixed on
a target.
J a m e s o n looked up
alarmed, at the row upon
row of vipers. Instinctively
he accelerated and pulled
up,away from the s p a c e
station. C a t c h i n g his
breath, he primed the beam
laser, turned tightly on the
horde of G a l c o p ships, and
o p e n e d fire.
J a m e s o n plunged again
into the G a l c o p fleet, now
c r o w d e d with debris from
exploded s p a c e ships. He
wasted a few more Vipers
with short bursts from his
laser, and as he turned
back on the fleet he
glanced at his watch: 10 to
1, Thursday. He only had
ten minutes to get to the
I C M A C meeting. Calling up
the local chart on the
N a v C o m p , he set the
c u r s o r on S o u t h s i d e bar,
Earth and h y p e r s p a c e d .
W o u l d he get there
before the T h o r g o i d s ?

It gets to Wednesday, and
you're sitting in your room
c h e w i n g on the remains of
the family C h r i s t m a s C a k e
from 1966, just thinking
about trying the Black
Forest C o n c r e t e C a k e of
1967 when you stop and
think, 'What's it all for?'
W h y does marzipan taste
like carpet underlay? Why
isn't biting cherries all its
cracked up to be. A n d what
would it be like to be a
Christmas cake?
At least part of the
answer may be found at a
D r a m s o c Acting W o r k s h o p ,
on W e d n e s d a y at 2.30.
T h e n you can learn all
about the strange world of
acting and if you want to
improvise being a
Christmas cake, that's up to
y o u . All y o u have to do is
meet in the storeoom.
Parachuting
Zero hour. T h e twin
lycomings bragised
relentlessly in the old dawn
air as the first team came in
fast and low, out of the
rising s u n . A thousand feet
below, the Kent
countryside slept on,
blissfully unaware of the
invasion to follow. Six
thousand feet above, the
s e c o n d team bundled in an
identical m a c h i n e
struggling for altitude
before one final run in.
' G o o d morning
H e a d c o r n , golf A l p h a Xray
Bravo, run in for
parachuting four passes.
T w o zero'.
'Roger uniform Bravo.
Foxy Sierra, stand off ten
minutes.'
'FS'.
Final check of static
lines, helmets, goggles,
then the J u m p master
squints out the open door
at the ground below.
'Five left'.
A flat skidding turn, as
the pilot picks up the run in
heading.
' C u t M n the door.'
The engine noise fades.
A pair of legs is slung over
the edge of the door.
S o m e w h e r e up front, a
warning buzzer sounds.
' N o w S M I L E ! O O ! '
'One thousand, Two..'
Mixed images. G r e e n
fields, blue sky, the aircraft
appearing to fall upwards.
T h e n the billowing orange
and white of my parachute,
spectacular paranomic
views. Directly below is the
target airfield, obviously
our arrival has not c o m e as
a surpise, as a small group
of figures is clustered right
in the middle of the drop-
zone waiting. The landing
is softer than expected.
Pick up your kit, and go to
investigate the m e n a n c i n g
group of figures in the
centre of the field. Their
eyes have already returnd
skywards as the s e c o n d
aircraft runs in at eight
thousand feet. Eight tiny
bodies tumble out of the
side, and float slowly
toward each other.
S o m e o n e is counting.
' L o o k e d like a two way
base, so that's four d o c k e d ,
five, who's that closing
now? Funnel!'
At this last remark, the
next formation which had
been building s e e m s to
turn itself inside out, and
b e c o m e s o n c e more eight
individual J u m p e r s .
S e c o n d ' s later eight
rainbow coloured c a n o p i e s
b l o s s o m .
They turn their attention
to y o u . 'That looked like a
pretty g o o d first jump, want
a hand back with your kit?'
IC Para club is going to
hold a first jump c o u r s e
next month. If you would
like information contact
Alastair M a c l e o d , E E 3 . It's
an experience I wouldn't
_ w a n t you to miss.
