Having only just taken over
the job I have still to get
fully into the swing of the
record buying program.
However I thought I'd take
this opportunity to pick out
s o m e of the less
mainstream records I have
bought recently O n e of my
personal interests is blues
and I nope to add at least a
few new blues records to
the collection I'm no
afficionado and even if I
was I would hesitate to
bore you with an in depth
history of every single Deaf
L e m o n Brickface et al. But
at the same time the
influence of the great
original blues players o n
modern popular music,
especially rock, can't be
over estimated. Artists like
Freddie King invented
many of the licks and riffs
cribbed by modern rock
guitarists. A n d groups like
the Rolling Stones might
have been nowhere without
M u d d y Waters, while Dire
Straits M e g a guitar-hero
Mark knopfler cites the
original slide players as a
strong influence on his
style of playing.
B B King is the man they
sometimes call the 'King of
the Blues Guitar' and is
certainly one of the better
known and more
commercially s u c c e s s f u l
bluesmen. His album 'Live
at the Regal' is often listed
as a classic and is a m o n g
recent library additions.
King claims he can't sing
and play at the s a m e time,
an almost open
contradiction to this
faultless playing. His music
is characterised by a
soulful 'talking guitar' style
A r e v i e w o f s o m e r e c e n t a d d i t i o n s t o t h e
H a l d a n e r e c o r d l i b r a r y , f r o m M a r k C o t t l e ,
H a l d a n e R e c o r d B u y e r .
If you want to hear more
rocking blues then H o u n d
D o g Taylor and E l m o r e
J a m e s are worth a listen.
A n d I can't finish without
mentioning a personal
favourite of mine Lightin'
Hopkin's who featured in
the B B C 2 blues special last
year, and s o m e of who's
best material is included on
volume 12 of the Sonet
label's 'Legacy of the blues'
series.
Finaly bastions of the
current alternative scene
'Here and N o w ' and Roy
Harper are both playing live
at present. For 'Here and
N o w ' it is sadly their
farewell tour. F o r m e d from
the remnants of the hippy
g r o u p G o n g , their m u s i c
took on a quite different
and surprisingly
c o m m e r c i a l s o u n d
remeniscent at times of
s u c h diverse influences as
the P o l i c e in terms of
rhythms and Pink Floyd in
terms of floating,
atmospheric guitar and
synth. Their last album
'Theatre' is well worth
listening to and s h o u l d be
available o n c e I get around
to dropping it off to the
librarian.
Roy Harper is one of
a n a c h r o n i s m s of the music
world, and the s p a c e here
is not nearly sufficient to
s u m him up. Harper will be
know to most people
through his association
with Led Zepplin (eg 'Hats
off to R o y - L e d ' Z e p 3) and
his friendship with J i m m y
Page who plays on his
album J u g u l a . But R o y
Harper is at his best as a
live entertainer playing his
o w n individualistic brand of
folk guitar to a small
audience, often playing
pubs and charity or free
festivals. Harper appears to
have scant regard to
c o m m e r c i a l consideration
and hence much of his
material is very difficult to
find. But hopefully I c a n
dig up e n o u g h to keep the
dedicated bunch of Harper
fans out there, w h o travel
miles to see the man play
at the oddest times and
places, happy. 'Jugula'
s h o u l d already have been
added to the tape
collection and 'Stormcock',
'Folkjokeopus' and 'Return
of the Sophisticated
Beggar' s h o u l d be around in
record soon.
The tape collection is
woeful in c o m p a r s o n to
that for records and one of
my major priorities is
increasing it. However
b e c a u s e of the enormity of
the task this will be the
work of several years. It is,
incidentally, surprising that
despite the fact that the
tape collection is lacking,
the vast majority of
requests are for records.
The legacy of the early
p s y c h e d e l i c bands is
apparent all over the place,
not least in terms of those
still playing. T h e Deviants
are an outfit literally stuffed
full of ageing famous
hippies w h o still
o c c a s i o n a l l y c o m e together
to play s o m e p u n c h y R'n'B.
Main members Mick Farren
and Larry Wallis (both ex-
Pink Fairies and Wallis also
original guitarist for
Motorhead) are joined by
ex M C 5 guitarist W a y n e
Kramer on their live album
' H u m a n G a r b a g e ' which is
a recording of their 1984
reunion at Dingwalls. The
recording manages to
c o m p e n s a t e s for some, but
unfortunately not all, of
Dingwalls rather poor
s o u n d and is an excellent
compilation.
I hope that at s o m e time
this year I'll buy something
to interest most people.
T h e records I have
mentioned are just odd
preferences of my own. But
please remember the
f a m o u s quote about
pleasing all the people all
the time.
. M o s t of us know something
about J o h n L e n n o n . We
know that he was one of
two leading m e m b e r s of the
Beatles, we know he was
rather controversial in his
words and actions both
during and after the
Beatles, and we know he
was involved with, and then
married, a J a p a n e s e
w o m a n called Y o k o O n o .
Lennon. a
d o c u m e n t a r y / p l a y / m u s i c a l
by B o b Eaton, tries to fill
the gaps in our knowledge
by using J o h n ' s o w n words,
the words of his friends,
and the lyrics of his songs.
The direction by Clare
Vanables was quite
extraordinary, in the sense
that while the cast of nine
took several parts e a c h
(except for those who
played Lennon), shared
parts, and generally tried as
hard as they c o u l d to
confuse the audience, the
whole thing turned out to
be quite credible, and even
comprehensible.
The set was also unusual.
Alison Chitty was faced
with the problem that the
musical instruments
needed for J o h n Lennon's
s o n g s could not be moved
at all during the show. Even
so, she managed to design
a stunning (and very
clever) back wall which
c h a n g e d spectacularly as
necessary.
J o h n L e n n o n is played
by both Mark M c G a n n and
Jonathan Barlow. Perhaps
the only fault in their
interpretations of the
y o u n g e r and older L e n n o n
was the slight lack of
overlap in character
development. O n e minute
we see J o h n y o u n g and
fiery, and the next minute,
older and cooler. Otherwise
their likeness to him, for
one w h o had never met him
at least, was quite startling.
Mr M c G a n n ' s voice
especially was uncannily
like Lennon's o w n .
Other notable
performances were given
by Martyn Ellis and M i a
Soteriou who played Paul
M c C a r t n e y and Y o k o O n o
respectively. T h o u g h
physically totally different
from the original (except
for his hair) Mr Ellis
managed to create Paul
just as we all know and
love him, using his face,
and to a lesser extent his
voice. M s Soteriou, while
addressing her audience
using one of Yoko's
speeches from after
Lennon's death, managed
to make Y o k o s e e m more
sympathetic than many
people had thought Y o k o
to be at the time!
For anyone w h o is or was
interested in the 'Fab Four'
going to see L e n n o n at the
Astoria theatre will be a
real treat the music, the
myth and the memories.

BOOKS
With the works of Albert
C a m u s the question is not
whether to take the books
at face value, but whether
they have a face value at
all. H e was one of the
greatest French writers of
this century; versatile, hard
hitting and observant, he
was not only a man of
words. C a m u s was o n c e a
professional footballer and
edited a French
underground new paper
during the 2nd W o r l d War.
In The Plague C a m u s
writes about an Algerian
port suffering an epidemic
of bubonic plague, viewed
through the eyes of a local
doctor. T h e town is sealed
off by sentries and the
people left to die, escapers
being shot, and subtle
c o m p a r i s o n s are made with
o c c u p i e d France. The
chronicle of increasing
deaths - several hundred a
day - decreasing food,
terror and despair creatres
an atmospher similar to a
Salem witchhunt, and for
the story alone the book is
fascinating.
C o l l e c t i o n s of his short
stories s u c h as Youthful
Writings are especially
brilliant - e a c h tiny fable
encapsulating an argument
or point of view on life, the
universe or anything.
P h i l o s o p h y , death, art,
religion emotions and
society all c o m e under the
scrutiny of this Nobel prize
winner.
Various of his b o o k s
published by Penguin
include Youthful Writings
and The Plague together
with The Outsider and The!
Fall, both of which stab at
the h y p o c r a c y of the
F r e n c h B o u r g e o i s . T h e s e
s h o u l d be available from
any large b o o k s h o p .

The Sure Thing
(Cannon Tottenham Ct Rd,
Haymarket, Chelsea)
A rather c h a r m i n g c o m e d y
in the H o l l y w o o d romantic
tradition. T w o opposites
are forced together for a
trip across A m e r i c a , one to
meet the 'sure thing' that
his friend has set him up
with the other to meet her
nascent yuppie boyfriend.
G o o d script and natural
acting from the two leads,
but a s h a m e about the
ending.
My Beautiful Laundrette
• • • • (Cannon Charing X,
Chelsea)
A story of the Thatcherite
s u c c e s s of an Asian lad
and his e x - N F friend as
they set up a launderette
business.
This excellent script and
fine acting allows great
insight to the motives and
desires of ail involved in
this film directed by
Stephen Frears.
Rocky IV * (Lecicester Sq
Thetare)
The Italian Spaniel slurs his
way through s o m e more
anti-commie trash. This
time his friend is killed by
the colossal C o m r a d e Ivan
Drago and therefore R o c k y ,
out of a need for revenge,
arranges a fight in the
U S S R . R u s s i a n s seem
surprisingly to have not
only better technology but
also better haircuts.
Stallone directed himself
through an extended pop
video and fails to make me
understand how he
manages to win over the
crowd at the end.
Black Narcissus • • • •
(Electric Screen)
Michael Powell's d e c i s o n to
shoot the entire film in the
studio allows him masterful
control of s p a c e in this tale
of flesh versus the spirit.
A group of nuns has it's
faith and resolve tested by
the freedom and passions
of the Himalayas. Powell
and Pressburger's usual
high standard of story
telling plus an essay in
colour s y m b o l i s m , well
worth the revival.
Colonel Redl • • • •
(Premiere)
An ambtious y o u n g
peasant ruthlessly climbs
the A u s t r o - H u n g a r i a n A r m y
ranks only to be betrayed
by the upper classes.
A slow start builds to a
masterpiece of an ending.
O n c e again S z a b o ' s
direction allows Klaus
Maria Brandauer to perform
magnificently as a man
willing to sacrifice family
and friends to s u c c e e d .
Death in a French Garden
• • * (Camden Plaza,
Chelsea)
The title is an
untranslatable pun and a
reference to the French title
of 'The Draughtsman's
Contract', to which this film
o w e s something. It is a
witty and erotic
p s h y c h o l o g i c a l thriller
involving a guitar teacher
who never quite manages
to work out what is
happening around him.
Rather self-consciously
stylish at times, but
nevertheless more
successful than
'Desperately S e e k i n g
S u s a n ' in France.
Death Wish Three 0
(Cannon Chelsea,
Haymarket, Oxford St
Prince Charles)
The well-known
c o n s c i e n c i o u s objector
(well he says he was in the
film) returns to waste s o m e
more creeps.
A n o b s c e n e and violent
film with no redeeming
qualities, except that I
found it quite funny in
parts, but that's no e x c u s e
for you to go and see it.
Defence of the Realm • * * • *
(Odeon Haymarket)
Brilliant c o n s p i r a c y yarn
about a journalist
uncovering the mystery
behind a political scandal.
The attractive couple
Gabriel B y r n s and Greta
S a c c h i join forces against
the evil authority. A g o o d
story well told.
Peppermint Freedom * * *
(Metro)
The aftermath of the
S e c o n d W o r l d War as seen
through the eyes of a
y o u n g G e r m a n girl.
Peter F o n d a plays a local
G l w h o fraternises with a
girl from the village. A
charming anti-war
statement w h o s e original
title is a play on the
confusion between freedom
and peace
