Union
There s e e m s to be s o m e
feeling a m o n g departments
that a c a d e m i c needs are
more important than the
welfare and social needs of
students. M a n y C o l l e g e
administrators know that
the welfare and social
needs of students are as
important as those of the
departments. T h e y know
that if sixth formers think
that the C o l l e g e has no
clubs and societies etc,
applications will drop. T h e
departments, though, s e e m
to be only interested in
expanding their research
work. I k n o w that the U G C
cuts have made it difficult
for departments. T h i s
doesn't mean, though, that
they should try to take
student union resources.
For example the F E L I X
Office and Beit T V L o u n g e
being asked to move. O n e
of the things that they want
to do with the area is build
a seminar room. There is
an e x c e s s of seminar
rooms. Does it seem
excessive for the C o l l e g e to
ask biology students to use
seminar rooms in other
departments?
FELIX
A s you can see from the
letters page there has been
a certain amount of
criticism of my decision to
publish the 'Strike FELIX'. I
d e c i d e d that education cuts
are not a party political
issue and so c o u l d be
covered as a feature. W h e n
I c a m e to C o l l e g e almost
3'/2 years ago it was only
'lefties' w h o went on d e m o s
and joined protests against
education cuts. S i n c e then
it s e e m s to me that Mrs
Thatcher has united
student unions against the
cuts. Several of my friends
vote Conservative. S i n c e
they c a m e to C o l l e g e they
have decided that they
must join protests against
their party's education
policies. This is b e c a u s e
they see the harm that
these policies are doing to
Britain's e c o n o m y . W h e n I
went to lobby M P s I
discovered that many back
bench Conservative M P s
o p p o s e the present
Government's education
policy (unfortunately, they
haven't got the guts to
o p p o s e it in the H o u s e ) .
For this reason I d e c i d e d
that the article on cuts was
a feature, not an opinion. I
am, though, a great
believer in the right of reply,
so if J o h n Martin or the
Conservative Society would
like to p r o d u c e two pages
(approx 1700 words)
defending the
Government's education
policy, I'll print it. I find it
difficult to believe its
possible to defend the
Government, but I'm
prepared to listen to Mr
Martin's arguments.
While on the subject of
articles for future F E L I X s ,
I'd like to challenge the
people w h o wrote to F E L I X
last term saying that F E L I X
is boring, to write 400 w o r d s
on rhino's willies (as
promised) so that I can
print it. Generally, I'm
running out of ideas for
features so if you have any
ideas for opinions or
features contact me and
either you or s o m e o n e else
can write the article.
FELIX Office
F E L I X is your newspaper.
This is why I am replying to
recent criticism. If the
p r o p o s e d move of the
F E L I X Office (as reported
in F E L I X last week and this
week) goes ahead, this may
no longer be the case.
F E L I X may b e c o m e the
N e w s p a p e r of Imperial
C o l l e g e U n i o n H a c k s . T h i s
is b e c a u s e the p r o p o s e d
site is out of the way. T h e
present site is passed by
large numbers of students.
Students see F E L I X staff at
work. They know where the
office is. This means that
feel they can contribute. A
student newspaper must be
in contact with students.
This means that it must be
in a prominent position.
You're lucky to have one of
the best student
newspapers in the country.
Defend it by preventing the
move (campaign details in
a future FELIX).
Editorial
J o h n Martin has attacked
my editorial c o m m e n t s on
Nicaraguan coffee. He has,
in my view every right to
attack my views. However,
he has no reason to attack
the fact that I express them
in the editorial. T h e
editorial is meant to be
intelligent c o m m e n t . It is
meant to be my views. That
means that it is meant to
provoke thought. Hopefully,
it will also attract a
response in the letters
page. T h e editorial is not
meant to be facts that every
student will agree with. It is
meant to provoke debate.
Valentine's Day
F E L I X is planning a
Valentine's Day special.
We're going to print the
Small A d s over a pink
heart. If you want to send a
message to the love of your
life, then drop them into
F E L I X by 1.30pm on
M o n d a y February 10. If
you have any ideas for
features in F E L I X in the
Valentine's issue, contact
me in the Office.

Bouncers Go
Bananas
Dear Mr S o u t h e y
I wish to inform all the
readers of this newspaper
of a particularly unpleasant
experience w h i c h I had
recently, in the hope that it
will not happen to them.
Last M o n d a y I went to
the discotheque ' B a n a n a s '
in W a r d o u r St. W l , to
attend the m u c h publicised
'Krazy Tie and L o o n y
S u n g l a s s e s ' party. W h e n I
got there, I was told by one
of the 'bouncers' that he
w o u l d not allow me in. It
was not because of my
dress, as I was wearing a
decent jacket and tie, and I
was certainly not drunk.
W h e n I asked him why he
w o u l d not let me in, his
immediate answer was
'because you're a f-cking c-
nt', said in those words. H e
and the other 'bouncer'
then proceeded to spit on
m e .
T o d a y I rang the
manager of the night club,
and he stood by his
bouncers' actions one
hundred per cent. H e told
me that, had he been in
their shoes, he w o u l d have
d o n e exactly the same. H e
finished by saying he had
better things to do than talk
to me.
I am not objecting to the
fact that I was denied entry
in spite of there being no
apparent reason to do so,
every night club has and
s h o u l d have the right to
refuse admission. I do,
however, object to being
spat on and insulted in the
manner which I have just
described. I see no reason
why people like myself or
indeed any reader of this
newspaper s h o u l d be
humiliated in this way for
no apparent reason, s o I
would ask and advise all
the students of Imperial
C o l l e g e not to visit this
night club..the s a m e or
worse things may happen
to them.
Yours sincerely,
Alastair Seymour

Party Political
FELIX
Dear Sir,
I write to express my anger
and disappointment at the
way in w h i c h under your
editorship the N e w s p a p e r
of I C U has degraded into a
Party Political publication. I
do not object to your
reporting current political
events w h i c h affect
students, but feel strongly
that the coverage given to,
for example, the recent
A U T strike has been
excessive and biased, and I
believe, judging by your
editorial remarks, tainted
by your own politics.
This in itself would not
be a complaint if you had
declared your intentions in
the election manifesto last
year. Instead, you promisee
to relieve us from the
b o r e d o m of last year's
Friday 24 January FELIX
