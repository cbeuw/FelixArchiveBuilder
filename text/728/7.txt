A s the internal Services
C o m m i t t e e C h a i r m a n I am
often asked the following
questions:
i) A l t h o u g h it is
unnecessary for the union
bar to restore its position
as the most used bar in
college it is evident that it
must compete successfully
with S o u t h s i d e Bar in order
to ensure that it is both a
financially viable enterprise
and a service used by a
wide cross section of the
students population.
ii) T h e major factor
underpinning the s u c c e s s
of S o u t h s i d e (figures from
last year s h o w that
Southside's takings are
almost double the U n i o n
Bar's takings) is the better
facilities which it enjoys by
virtue of its situation. It has
a s p a c i o u s bar with s p a c e
to seat a reasonably large
number of customers in
s o m e degree of comfort. It
has the majority of the halls
of residence situated
around it.
iii) T o ensure (i) in the face
of (ii) the union will be
required to make a large
capital investment in its
bar.
iv) T h e timing of c will
undoubtedly be affected by
the fact that although the
union is at present
financially responsible for
the union bar, it is not the
licence holder. T h e licence
will remain in the Sherfieild
building until after the end
of the current a c a d e m i c
year.
2 What kind of alterations
should be make to the bar?
Firstly, it would not be
sensible to seek to turn the
union bar itself into s o m e
kind of 'mini southside'.
A l t h o u g h its share of the
market has decreased in
recent years the bar has
always made a profit with
that one room alone. There
is quite simply not e n o u g h
room to a c c o m o d a t e large
numbers of people who
wish to sit d o w n with
groups of friends to enjoy a
quiet social drink. In any
case there is no doubt in
my mind that even if we
were to install better
furnishings there would still
be elements from the
C C U / R u g b y C l u b barnite
set who would deem it
necessary to vomit on them
simply b e c a u s e they would
set this as a 'Tradition'.
W e do, however, have the
potential to create a
'lounge bar' atmosphere in
the room which currently
houses the union S n a c k
Bar. In the evenings this
room is, at present,
underused. If we c o u l d
install better furniture here
a n d s p e n d s o m e m o n e y
improving the appearance

of the room we would have
an area suited to the more
casual bar user. It has the
space to a c c o m m o d a t e a
reasonably large number of
people and it already has a
food outlet w h i c h could,
given sufficent d e m a n d ,
serve s n a c k s and coffee to
those who appreciate that
drinking ad nauseam is not
the last word in social
intercourse. T h e r e would
also exist the possibility of
holding cabaret evenings
along the lines of the
excellent but sadly under
publicised c o m e d y
evenings that were
organised by IC Ents at the
beginning of last term.
Television is already on its
way.
3 When Can This
Improvement Programme
Start?
T h e glib answer to this is
'when we have the money',
but in addition it would be
reckless for the union to
dive into such a major
p r o g r a m m e immediately
after taking over the bar.
T i m e must clearly be taken
sorting out the
administrative implications
of the takeover. A logical
time to start is when the
union takes over the
licence. This gives us a
m u c h freer hand in what
we intend to do (would the
college engage in
p r o g r a m m e of blocking
tactics to black a move that
would clearly be designed
to take money away from
their own outlets?). It also
gives us time firstly to plan
the c h a n g e s and s e c o n d l y
to prove to a potential
investor that the bar is
capable of making a profit
when run by the union.
T h i s means that we have
to work with the bar as it is
for s o m e months, during a
period w h i c h is traditionaly
quiet and thus have to
e n c o u r a g e traditional users
of the bar to support it.
4Does it not seem a little
paradoxical that in order to
change the face of the bar
we seem to be encouraging
the traditional 'bar drinking'
elements?
Yes it does. However it is
a logical move in so far as
we need to make money
during this crucial period
so we must use the bar to
its best affect and it is
designed as a hard drinking
bar. Over and above this
disgracefully capitalistic
attitude I would contend
that due to the c h a o s of the
last term the bar has
d i s c o u r a g e d many people
who joined the college this
year, we may never win
them back but I would say
to anyone w h o feels this
way, please go and take
another look, the bar is
visibly improving and even
as it is it can still provide a
pleasant setting for the
casual drinker. A n o t h e r
thing to point out is that
both the union and the bar
manager both seek to curb
the intimidating nature of
s o m e of the acts performed
under the influence of
alcohol in the name of
having a bit of a laugh with
the boys.
In particular, the union
can in no way c o n d o n e any
kind of sexist a b u s e of
female customers. T h i s sort
of behaviour has o c c u r r e d
in the past and it is of the
utmost importance that any
recurrence of this sort of
behaviour is reported to the
union so that the offenders
can be dealt with.
5Why did internal services
committee give approval to
the employment of
members of Links 22 and
chaps in preference to
other students?
It didn't, and I personally
would o p p o s e any s u c h
move. T h e meeting of 13
J a n u a r y was attended by
M o o r e Lyttle, the union bar
manager at my invitation.
He was not a member of
the committee and as s u c h
it would be improper for
the committee to make any
kind of policy dictating the
manner in w h i c h he should
employ bar staff. In any
case, Mr Lyttle made no
s u c h suggestion and would
not support s u c h a move-
you can ask him if you like,
(that's more than FELIX
did). Mr Lyttle did however,
point out that there were
several students already
engaged to work as casual
staff w h o happen to be
members of the
organisations in question.
He suggested that rather
than giving these people a
free hand in the nights that
they work, that s o m e of
them be asked on a
specific night in order that
there would be a point of
contact for other members
of the club in the union as
well as S o u t h s i d e (the
S o u t h s i d e bar manager is a
m e m b e r of all three 'tie
clubs'). It was simply a
move to e n c o u r a g e one
group of people to support
the union of which they are
or have been m e m b e r s by
using a bar around which
many of their official
functions are based
6 To employ any member
of staff for any reason
other than their ability to
perform the function
required of bar staff is not
only unacceptably
discriminatory it is no way
to run a business
It would have been nice if
the F E L I X staff members
c o n c e r n e d had bothered to
ask eigther myself or the
bar manager about the
issues in question before
printing the rather
misleading article 'Bar staff
F E L I X 17.1.86 ) especially
at a time when it is of
paramount importance that
F E L I X and the union pull
together to stem the
relentless onslaught of the
Biology department. W e
wouldn't want to end up
with the union office and
the lounge moved into the
bar cellers and a FELIX
office half way up the
Q u e e n s tower.
