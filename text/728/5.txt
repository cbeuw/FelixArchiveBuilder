Below the Belt
W h e n e v e r I start writing
this c o l u m n , I m o m e n t a r i l y
put my pen d o w n in
disgust. W h o am I to s a y
nasty things about p e o p l e ?
W h o am I to corrupt the
m i n d s of the i n n o c e n t with
my tales of the w a n t o n
b e h a v i o u r of the i m m o r a l
few. L u c k i l y this s e i z u r e
never lasts very long... I
very q u i c k l y r e m e m b e r w h y
it is so important. B i t c h i n g
is almost as g o o d as f o o d
and m e n !
S o , here we go folks..but
r e m e m b e r , y o u mustn't try
any of this at h o m e .
Firstly, here is a story
that illustrates what I've
always as said - y o u can't
s e d u c e a d r u n k e n m a n ! A
well k n o w n c h e m i s t tried to
have her w i c k e d w a y with a
certain sporty
mathematician... in the
m i d d l e of a party... while he
was drunk. N e e d l e s s to say
all s h e got out of him w a s a
pathetic d r o o p a n d profuse
a p o l o g i e s . M e n !
F i e l d M a r s h a l l R o g e r
P r e e c e has a lot to a n s w e r
for in this respect. What a
s h o c k it w a s to hear him
advertising the Field C u p
( c o n s i s t i n g of lots of
b o o r i s h y o u n g m e n r u n n i n g
a r o u n d Beit Q u a d ,
d e s t r o y i n g it as well a n d as
q u i c k l y as they c a n , and
killing off their brain cells,
with lots of lovely ethanol).
S u r e l y this is not the kind
of 'action' that the girls of
Imperial C o l l e g e want to
see! T h e f o l l o w i n g day all
the pretty o n e s will be
absolutely useless
(including G o l d e n B o y
P r e e c e himself). S o m e
p e o p l e have no
c o n s i d e r a t i o n .
B e n ' m i n i - v a m p ' S i d l e
was out c o l d in the P h y s i c s
W a v e g u i d e last Friday
afternoon... again a l c o h o l
was to b l a m e (oh, the
horrors of the evil drink).
He, of c o u r s e , r e m e m b e r s
n o t h i n g of this, neither
d o e s he r e m e m b e r
a n y t h i n g about the
p e r s o n a g e w h o w a s p l a c e d
o n top of him (but then he
did s e e m a little
u n r e s p o n s i v e at the time).
F o r m e r s u p e r w i m p J Martin
T a y l o r s e e m s to have been
l o o k i n g rather trendy of
late. T h i s may (or m a y not)
have s o m e t h i n g to d o with
the fact that he s e e m s to
have been m i s s i n g from
both his department a n d
the F E L I X office preferring
the h o m e c o m f o r t s of
W e e k s Hall (residence -
c o i n c i d e n t a l l y , of c o u r s e -
of S u n n y 'ain't I l o u d '
B a i n s . R u m o u r has it that
they will be trying out
together for the new T V
s h o w 'Dreary a n d
M a k e n o i s e . '
Lastly, a s e a f a r i n g tale
about J o l l y R o g e r , c a p t a i n
of the H o l b e i n H o u s e
b o o z e c r u i s e , a n d his trip
to F r a n c e . T h r e e men
e n d e d up having to hold
him d o w n after too m u c h of
the ferry's fire water c a u s e d
h i m to t h r o w a fit. L u c k i l y
n o p l a n k - w a l k i n g w a s
called for, but as far as I
can see he's still n o n e too
p o p u l a r a m o n g the
s h i p m a t e s .
W e l l , lots of love
kids...and r e m e m b e r :
n o t h i n g is m o r e b o r i n g
than a wet J a n u a r y
afternoon.
