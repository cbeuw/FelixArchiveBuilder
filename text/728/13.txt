Mr Wright and wrong
History throws up tome
strange heroes. There was a
fine, not so long ago, when
Peter Wright was admired by
enjy • select group of right-
wing patriots. A former senior
official of M15 and close frieno
of Chapman Pincher, he left
this country for self-imposed
exile in Australia, complaming
to friends that there were ' too-
many blacks' in this country.
Just the sort of man you'd
expect any decent and right-
minded liberal thinker to shun
and avoid. And yet, and yet, he
has suddenly become a hero to
large sections of the Left
because of the book he's
writing about MI5, an orga-
nisation he thinks is infested
with either Commie agents or
dangerous liberals (I shouldn't
think it has too many blacks).
It's a funny old world when
villains become heroes.
Ever since I first revealed Mr
Wright's book I've been
attacked by the caring Left,
with such accusations as:
' Which side of the barricades
are you on ?' (The other side
from Mr Wright tends to be my
Peter Wright: Write on.
stock defensive reply). When
the Cabinet Secretary, Sir
Robert Armstrong, tried to
stop the book in Australia, the
defence counsel rubbished oiy
article, even though he knew it
to be true (he later apologised
to me). And last week, Brian
Perman, the managing director
of the publishers, Heinemann,
told m
e h
o
w disgraceful and
'unhelpful' I was, and then
refused to talk any more.
As I've got nothing to lose, I
might as well bring you up to

trying to keep ijuiet about the
book, the Australian wandered
round the Frankfort Book Fair
with a badge on his' jacket
giving details of the book and
its contents.
Things aren't going well on
the legal front, either. Heine -
mann has already asked for two
adjournments in Australia
while it prepares its legal case.
There's a worry that perhaps it
has chosen the wrong court in
which to fight the Govern-
ment's action, centring round
whether Mr Wright has broken
his MI5 contract by revealing
its secrets.
Peering over the barricade
nervously, I do hope the book
is published, if only because the
Government is so anxious to
stop it. But if it meant allying
myself with Chapman Pincher,
Fm not so sure.
