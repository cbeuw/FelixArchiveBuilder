Of all the years in my life,
1986 looks to be by far the
most recent. It certainly
started well. O n N e w Year's
Eve I s m u g g l e d two cans of
shandy up to my room and
got leglessly drunk. W o k e
up this morning feeling
really ill. I hope it isn't
morning sickness. I was
wearing nothing but my left
sock and had a lump of
concrete in my mouth. I
hope I haven't defaced any
famous L o n d o n landmarks,
as I am dead patriotic.

T o d a y on the tube a large
hairy inebriate informed me
that he hated my guts. T h i s
surprised me as I do not
recall s h o w i n g them to him.
T h e man is obviously not
an intellectual like me.

T o d a y I felt like being kind
to politically repressed
minorities so I gave twenty
p e n c e to a man w h o looked
like a liberal. H e was not in
the least bit grateful. N o
wonder the Tories run the
country.
Jan 8th
Went to my first Q T
meeting; it was dead
brilliant! There were lots of
R E A L L Y Z A N Y people
there. W e sat and
discussed plans for s o m e
really F A B Stunts and
events. I think I will
b e c o m e an anarchist when
I grow up.

It's greeyut, man!
T h e prestigious leaders of
Teetotal S o c are trying to
find a name for their new
mascot-a can of B a r b i c a n
lager. T h e y decide that this
s h o u l d bear the name of
o n e of the committee
members, and that they
s h o u l d have an election to
see w h i c h o n e of them will
be remembered by this
great honour.
There are six committee
members seated around a
circular table: the
President, the C h a i r m a n ,
the Secretary, the
Treasurer, the Publicity
Officer, and an Ordinary
C o m m i t t e e Member.
A n c i e n t club tradition
insisits that voting take
place a c c o r d i n g to a strict
set of rules that must all be
exactly adhered to. T h e
rules are:-
1 N o member may vote for
themselves.
2 T h e President and
C h a i r m a n can vote for
a n y b o d y except e a c h other.
3 T h e member sitting
opposite the Secretary
must vote for the peson
sitting on their left.
4 A n y m e m b e r sitting two
places away from the
Treasurer must vote for the
person sitting opposite
them.
5 N o member may vote for
the O r d i n a r y C o m m i t t e e
M e m b e r if they are sitting
next to him.
If none of the above rules
contradicts e a c h other, and
the winner got four votes,
who won? Solutions to me
at the FELIX office by
1.00pm T u e s d a y for the
usual fivepound prize.
Please feel free to hand in
c o m m e n t s , criticisms , and
any interesting problems
you c o m e across.
the freshers' dinners this is
going to be even better.
Wargames
Just when you thought
peace had broken out-
beware, wargames are
c o m i n g . With weekly
meetings continuing their
massive attendance (don't
say you joined for the
prestige!) there is little to
report, despite a weekly
casualty rate in the
millions.
We can however reveal
why the A x i s lost World
War 2-they were beaten by
C h e m i c a l Engineers-their
own.
Repeated i n c o m p e t e n c e
on a scale unparalled since
an Egyptian army launched
a (doomed) amphibious
assault across the Red S e a
has resulted in near
hysteria amongst
wargamers as catastrophe
follows catastrophe. To
sum the major points:
J a p a n has lost the war 3
times inside a year, going
d o w n virtually without a
fight, and best of all
G e r m a n y has been invaded
and defeated by a British
army (no A m e r i c a n s
involved) in 1942 - I
thought there was
something wrong with the
D-Day celebrations.
S o if you're out there,
wondering if you're g o o d
e n o u g h - c o m e along-from
now on, things can only get
better (surely!)

Do you realise its nine
weeks since Rag Week
staggered to an end. That's
63 days you've had to
rekindle your enthusiam for
charitable activities. S o
when you're told that your
participation in forthcoming
attractions is requested
you're all going to leap at
the c h a n c e , aren't y o u ?
T h e first rag tour is about
to take place, around the
Midland and Northern
universities for which we
need at least 20 willing
bodies to go Rag M a g
selling for a long weekend
(Friday-Monday). T h e date
will be fixed at T u e s d a y s
Carnival Committe meeting
(1pm U p p e r Lounge) and
further details are in this
weeks Broadsheet (but you
don't have to be R C S to
go). N a m e s to R C S U .
Next we want to
e n c o u r a g e as many people
as possible to give Blood.
There will probably be two
donation session at least,
one of which will be a
W e d n e s d a y afternoon for
the-sporting. S o if you're a
lapsed ex-doner or you've
never quite got round to it
before sign up in R C S U ,
ICU or on a union notice
board, and it really doesn't
hurt!
One final word; tickets
for the R C S U A n n u a l
Dinner are now on sale, at
£16. Held at the Forum
Hotel, with Willy Rushton
speaking; if you enjoyed
Sci Fi
As P i c o c o n 4 a p p r o a c h e s ,
it brings to me happy
memories of P i c o c o n 1. I've
never quite been sure just
what made P i c o c o n 1 so
special, maybe it was the
way Mike M o r c o c k just
dropped in, or Christopher
Tolkein sent us an original
one of his father's doodles
by way of an apology for
his absence. It did look,
though, as if there was a
large dirty rain cloud in our
silver lining, but Harry
Harrison didn't turn up in
the end (he was too busy
ripping Stanislav Leon off
at the time, I s u p p o s e , in
his soon to be published
T h e Stainless Steel Kat
saves a Hack writer from
bankruptcy yet again'), but
he did send a games book
of what would have
happened if he did. The
talks were a sheer pleasure
from G e o r g e Lucas's 'A
Switch in Time and I'll
make Nine (Episodes)' and
'101 Depraved T h i n g s to do
with an Ewok or the
Seamier Side of Star Wars'.
I've always wondered about
certain n a m e s — H a n s Solo,
Leia O r g a n a — w e l l now I
know. IC S F won the
S c i e n c e Fiction charades
despite getting
' X L Y S B R H J C L L Y The
U n p r o n o u n c a b l e ' as one
title. Their opponents were
stumped by '-' a little know
work by the S w e d i s h 17th
century proto-sf writer Otto
Bold. Live roleplaying was
m u c h in evidence but due
to the failure of T T A L T
(Treasure Trap A r m s
Limitation Talks) several
more headless bodies were
transported to the bowels
of Life S c i , were hoards of
gibbering failed doctors
were unleashed to practice
their art. However
wholesale slaughter was
stopped by the banning of
Thanganive the
Inscrutable's fireball when
Chemistry refused to let
him sign for twenty litres of
napalm. Arthur C Clark
sent us a telegram of
congratulations which he
then denied he ever sent
(see his forthcoming series
of 'Arthur C Clark's
Mysterious Messages'). S o
with fond memories of
P i c o n o n 1 I am completely
confident that P i c o c o n o n e -
vee will surpass even its
greatest heights.
P S P i c o c o n one-vee will
take place on Saturday
15th Feb and will start at
10am (it will be repeated
via a time-warp in 1857)
