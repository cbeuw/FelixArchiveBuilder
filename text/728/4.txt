Barclays
Boycott
L o n d o n University General
U n i o n C o u n c i l have passed
a motion asking G U C
Finance C o m m i t t e e to
consider the financial
implications of refusing to
accept Barclay's Bank
c h e q u e s at U L U because of
Barclay's links with South
Africa. If the move goes
through students will n o
longer be able to u s e
Barclay's c h e q u e s for room
b o o k i n g s or in the U L U
shop, bar or cafe. T h e
opticians a n d the travel
agency are not managed by
U L U a n d s o will be
unaffected.
Switch
Delayed
The proposed c h a n g e - o v e r
of the J C R and the
Sherfield refectory is likely
to be delayed b e c a u s e of a
shortage of money. In a
letter to U n i o n President
Carl Burgess, C o l l e g e
Secretary J o h n S m i t h
stated that there is 'no w a y
in which the C o l l e g e c a n
find the cash required to
undertake the full
programme in a single
year'. It is n o w proposed
that the work should be
carried out over a three
year period. T h i s year all
the work o n the kitchens,
fast food service, w i n d o w s
in the J C R , a n d
refurnishing the S C R
s h o u l d be completed. 1987
s h o u l d see the completion
of the food hall o n level 2
and the conversion of the
ground floor to the J C R ,
leaving alterations to the
S C R to be completed in
1988.
Redundant
Academics
Education Secretary S i r
Keith J o s e p h has p r o d u c e d
proposals that, if adopted,
would give universities the
power to dismiss a c a d e m i c
staff appointed to new
posts because of
redundancy, or for
financial reasons'. T h e
Association of University
Teachers a n d the
Committee of V i c e -
C h a n c e l l o r s have been
asked for their views o n the
proposals.

Mum Is
Fab
National Student, the N U S
publication, has published
the results of its poll on
'the most fab people a n d
things'. K e n Livingstone
c a m e s e c o n d in the
Favourite Politician
category, being pipped at
the post by the infamous
'none—they're all no good'.
T o p of the pops of 'least-
liked politician' c a m e
Margaret Thatcher (shock,
horror, surprise). Most fab
thing or person in the
whole world has s u c h a
mixture that it is worth
listing the whole lot: (1) M y
boyfriend/girlfriend/
m u m / d a d etc (what's the
etc?) (2) B o b Geldof (3)
Nelson M a n d e l a (4) Mother
T h e r e s a (5) S a m F o x (6)
Indian F o o d (7) Nature etc
(?!) (8) R y a n O ' N e a l (9) S e x

The favourite group or
recording artiste table
s h o w s students to be
remarkably conservative in
their musical tastes,
consisting nearly
exclusively of bands from
the 70s a n d rock groups of
the 80s. Whatever
happened to N e w Wave?
Reflecting high
intellectual standards, the
B e a n o came 6th in
favourite reading matter.
S o m e t h i n g called Kerrang!
also received a mention. It
s e e m s that students are
quite a predictable lot.

worked for IC for thirty
years a n d in the past he

to move out of L o n d o n to
the country, but 'cannot
make up their minds where

years, said that M r Daniels
had always been an easy
person to work with a n d
had given a lot of thought
to students' needs. H e
