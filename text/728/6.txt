The AUT
Strike
W e d n e s d a y saw the A U T
strike, in protest at the
falling funds for higher
education. This affects us,
the students, as well as the
staff. T h e y have their
gripes—and you s h o u l d
know what they are—but
we too have more. Next
year Sir Keith plans to
increase grants by 2%
whilst inflation is 7%.
Furthermore we will not be
able to claim housing
benefit over the C h r i s t m a s
and Easter vacations nor
will we be able to claim
Social Security over the
summer. This represents a
drastic cut in our financing-
of about a quarter if you
claim housing benefit (ie
rent a private place to live)-
obviously very severe in
any case. Already most of
us are very poor. This drop
in funding will severely bias
the opportunity for higher
education towards those
with more of their own
money. Why do they do
this? There are 2 reason (i)
these people vote tory, and
(ii) it seems likely they are
trying to force industry to
support higher education.
Very g o o d idea, you may
say. but if industry pays
then h o w many art c o u r s e s
do you think will survive?

In the education cuts last
year, Salford suffered the
worst of all. They found
alternative funds from
industry alright, but now
they're strongly biased
towards S c i e n c e and
T e c h n o l o g y . W h y is it so
much harder for s c i e n c e
students than engineers to
get s p o n s o r s h i p s from
industry? B e c a u s e their
courses are less vocational
and they are liable not to
end up working for their
sponsors. Clearly, industry
isn't going to waste money
on courses that don't make
money. T h e reason why
they don't make money is
because they have no
direct power to influence
the lives of masses of
people; if you design a
more efficient m a c h i n e that
offers ever more luxury,
people-being ultimately
lazy-will buy it. S c i e n c e
and T e c h n o l o g y is the
basis of your whole society.
But this doesn't mean it's
the only thing worth
studying, money should
have nothing to do with
education. T h e freedom of
opportunity for a wide
variety of courses for
everyone willing and
intellectually able to do
s h o u l d be defended as a
political right. It is highly
regrettable that the word
'politics' s h o u l d every be
mentioned in an
educational context, but
this is no ordinary
situation. Y o u may be
under the blissful delusion
that the G o v e r n m e n t has
less m o n e y to s p e n d and
that we must all work
together to pull through the
'World E c o n o m i c
R e c e s s i o n ' as a nation. T h i s
is rubbish, our country is
getting richer all the time
continually the amount of
money available for the
Government to invest is
increasing. It just s e e m s
less b e c a u s e it is biased
into a smaller and smaller
section of society, business
a n d c o m p a n i e s , people
w h o work hard to make
more money out of money
the rest of us don't get to
see it! T h i s is part of the
meaning of the word
'conservatism'. T h e y s p e n d
it on helping people to set
up their own c o m p a n i e s
and take it from those w h o
have no jobs, biasing the
money continuously
towards those who already
have it. If you support the
point of view that this is
unfair and should be
resisted, then you (and I)
should support the A U T .
Y o u may ask 'but how
does their day of action
affect the government?'
T h e answer to this is
simple. It gets publicity,
w h i c h is liable to lose votes
for them, and that is all
they're worried about.

Student Houses
M u c h c o n c e r n has been
voiced over the s o m e t i m e s
appalling state of repair of
Evelyn G a r d e n s , not least
in FELIX. This s e e m s to
have drifted towards
c o m p l a c e n c y perhaps
partly due to a reassuring
profile of Pete Hallworth
M a n a g i n g S u r v e y o r
(Residences). T h i s man
was portrayed as a genial,
conscientious administrator
a n d little attention in the
article was give to Evelyn
G a r d e n s with most
criticisms pre-emptively
glossed-over with the
promise of a grandiose
s c h e m e s for the student
houses.
However, all is not rosy-
m u c h of the 'vital repair
work' seems to be
c o n c e r n e d with the external
appearence of the h o u s e s
(well, how many members
of the general public do
\ you know that see the
! inside of a student
residence? Few
improvements were made
inside the houses and
those w h i c h were often
poor and slapdash. For
example, in Bernard S u n l e y
eggshell paint was used in
a bathroom which duly
cracked due to the steam.
O n e of the biggest
problems with the
contractual labour is that it
is not systematically
c h e c k e d by a C o l l e g e
representative or
administrator and even if
complaints are made to the
contractors, the workmen
are moved on from site to
site, under C o l l e g e
direction so few s h o d d y
jobs are made g o o d . This
last point a s s u m e d that
administrative powers-that-
be will actually deal with
complaints from wardens:-
sadly this rarely seems to
be true-examples of this
Laissez-Faire attitude are
legion. For example
defective water heaters in
Bernard S u n l e y H o u s e have
not been repaired or
replaced and there is also
only one functional shower,
between over one hundred
residents, with hot water-all
the rest are leaky,
unfinished or have very
erratic hot water supplies-
all these defects have been
reported by wardens to
Peter Hallworth.
Instructions have been
given that Wardens are to
report w o r k m e n that lack
security passes-this c o m e s
as a geat relief since
w i n d o w locks are in s u c h a
poor state of repair that
any paint-splattered man
c o u l d infiltrate a worksite
under the guise of a repair
man a n d help himself to
the students' goodies, and
student mail since only two
Evelyn G a r d e n s H o u s e s
possess locks on the
pigeon holes. Several large
thefts have o c c u r e d from
houses and while they may
be entirely due to doors
being left open by busy
workmen and not bogus
labourers the situation
must be improved and
action taken.
Perhaps o n e of the
arguments against an
intensive programme of
internal re-furbishments is
purely one of cost. Whilst
this is valid, the
organisation of works is
s u c h that contractual
labour is employed, indeed
at the time of writing Willis
J a c k s o n is still in the hands
of the contractors. At least
a term overdue.
All in all, residents are
getting a very raw deal
from an adminstration
w h i c h cannot be bothered
to repair houses
adequately, w h i c h does not
check the finished work
and usually fails to have
bad work rectified. All you
have to do is to look
around Evelyn G a r d e n s and
c o m p a r e external and
internal conditions to see
where the C o l l e g e
R e s i d e n c e Adminstrations
real interests lie.
Is it any wonder that
when you c o m e for your
interview at IC you only
ever see Halls of
R e s i d e n c e ?
