FELIX. I would also like to
remind y o u of your
criticism of M r R o w e ' s
efforts.'FELIX hasn't been
lively a n d innovative,' 'This
year FELIX has reported on
boring news.1
Y o u r last three issues
incorporate anti- government
p r o p a g a n d a in articles
covering ninety per cent of
the front a n d back covers.
Y o u d o not, however give
any mention of the struggle
at K i n g s C o l l e g e to remain
outside the N U S closed
s h o p union, with w h i c h
cause many students, at
Imperial have great
sympathy. Neither d o y o u
resist the c h a n c e to
quash any moderate
opinion which does appear
with your own, often
unjustifiable comment.
Here I refer particularly to
your c o m m e n t s on
N i c a r a g u a n coffee: 'It may
not make c o m m e r c i a l sense
but if y o u want a
c o m m e r c i a l meal y o u go to
M a c d o n a l d s . Dave K i n g s t o n
should not have o p p o s e d
the motion'. O b v i o u s l y
your opinion is that every
morsel we eat must be o n
our behalf, a political
statement. A s a sabbatical
M r Kingston has a duty to
represent students like
myself, w h i c h he did, in a
way in w h i c h he thought fit.
C o m e o n H u g h , toe the
line a n d keep your
promises. B e controversial,
but fair a n d get the other
half of the story then, as
before, you'll get my vote
and support.
Yours faithfully,

Dear H u g h
I thought that this week's
centre pages on the faces
of Christianity were very
interesting. T h e opening
lines expressed s o m e
c o m m o n criticisms of
Christianity that are usually
voiced by non-religious
people. T h e article clearly
s h o w e d there are many
types of Christians, but I
should like to say that there
are many types of n o n -
religious people as well,
and not all are as
antagonistic towards
Christians as the o p e n i n g
c o m m e n t s suggest.
Certainly, there are
people w h o often attack
Christians, trying to s h o w
their creed as a fraud, a n d
scrutinising the Bible to try
and discredit it. A s an
alternative s u c h people
usually offer s c i e n c e a n d
logic, but I would venture
to suggest that s u c h people
are more narrow-minded
than Christians. T h e r e are
few things which cannot be
explained logically but
s u c h people are, in my
opinion, taking current
scientific thought as
gospel, a n d see Christianity
as a threat to their o w n
religion. T h e s e are the
people w h o treat lecture
notes as infallible
documents.
Also, there are cynical
sceptics w h o s e e m unable
to believe in anything,
possibly because they d o
not believe in themselves.
S u c h people are often
depressed, a n d attack
religion b e c a u s e they are
jealous of the happiness
and contentment that
religious people have, a n d
they are the most insecure.
However, there are n o n -
religious people w h o are
not dismissive about
religion. I am always
interested in what religious
people believe, not as a
joke or a curiosity, but
because I think that there
isn't one true a n d right w a y
to live your life, a n d that by
listening to everyone
around y o u , you'll e n d up
moving in approximately
the right direction. A
Buddist said on television
that most people s e e life as
a long a n d narrow road,
from which any deviation is
wrong, but that he s a w it as
a circle, with many possible
ways of reaching the
centre. A l t h o u g h I'm not a
Buddist, I remember
thinking h o w m u c h I
agreed with that part of
what he said.

Porn Again...
Dear S i r
First, I apologise to those
w h o found it illiterate a n d
'non-sensical'-next time I
shall tone d o w n m y article
to avoid inflaming the
F E L I X typists a n d s o
hopefully their fingers will
not slip s o m u c h .
B a c k to the replies:
A s a point of information
n o n e of o u r films portray
violence, a n d especially not
rape.
T h e question of morals
reappears-l think we shall
have to agree to differ as
neither of us is immoral yet
we always reach different
c o n c l u s i o n s . I still believe
w a t c h i n g this event for 2
hours a year, c a n no way
dominate our behaviour for
the other 8758.
It w a s said that ' H o n
Porn...degrades a n d
humiliates m e n a n d
w o m e n , portraying them as
objects to be used a n d
abused'. This is a very low
opinion of mankind-if either
party don't want sex, then
that's where they u s e the
w o r d 'No'.
Yet again, the critics try
to ridicule a n d humiliate
supporters of the event. I'd
like to turn M r Harman's
point around-l w a s not
trying to portray o p p o n e n t s
as 'self-righteous purists',
but rather c o n d e m n the
portrait of supporters as
dirty perverts. R e s p e c t o u r
opinion as w e respect
yours.
Let's take a different
view, s u p p o s i n g H o n Porn's
Night w a s banned, what
will it achieve? Will the
sexist, chauvinist attitudes
at IC disappear? O r even
diminish? I think not,
infrequent pornography is
not the problem.
A l w a y s o u r critics want
to ban the event. This is a
negative attitude, c h a n g i n g
nothing. If they want to see
s e x i s m at IC eradicated, try
positive solutions, getting
to the root of the problem.
I'm sure a lot of y o u will
say 'fine words, where's the
beef?'. Last year R S M U
made a point of holding all
parties first with o n e or two
female colleges. At s o m e
parties the w o m e n
o u t n u m b e r e d the men. T h i s
year, R S M U h a s initiated a
Ladies Sports team for
those w h o want to play for
their C C U . Both these
decisions are aimed at
removing the sexual
pressure resulting from IC's
poor ratio, a n d
e n c o u r a g i n g social
intercourse from a base of
equality.
Finally, M r P r e e c e a s k e d
'why R S M U has to place
s u c h importance o n this
event'. W e don't but w e do
believe people have the
right to c h o s e if they want
to see it or not.
/ remain yours etc
