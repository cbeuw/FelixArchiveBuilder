'Lite is just a boil on the big toe of
the Universe' as my old mate Igor
Nedovitch, sports correspondent on
the Valdivostock Gazzette and
Advertiser, once said to me over a
bottle of anti-freeze. Always a man
with a sense of perspective and an
alcohol problem, I think Igor (or
Neddy as he was known to the lads
at the Marshall Bulganin memorial
tractor plant social club and pigeon
circle) would have summed up his
philosophy of life in the following
manner. It doesn't matter if you live
under a ruthless psychopathic
dictatorship as long as you've got at
least one pleasure in life so sit back,
relax and have another G and T
(Glycol and Tonic). What a guy, pity
he forgot Andropov was a Moscow
Dynamo fan when he wrote up their
3-0 hammering by Red Star Omsk. I
still get the odd letter from out of
the Gulag though.
Well as I sit here and write this I
just hope that the head of MI5 isnt
heavily into jazz funk (not to mention
the fact that life is too wonderful a
thing to waste time getting deeply
philosophical over and that if the
system's screwing you, then you're a
bit of a wimp if you don't try and
fuck the system).
I really didn't know where to start
this week (as you may have guessed)
till I noticed that tonight at Chelsea
Town Hall sees the only London
appearance of Robert Anton Wilson.
Who? you may well say. Well back in
1976 there were published three
books called the iliuminatus trilogy
which became cult bestsellers. They
are the definitive be-all-ami-end-all
of the conspiracy paranoia genre,
Jinking CIA, freemasons, UFQ's, the
Kennedy assasination, the Mafia Mid
the death ot er among
others in a wacking sci-fi fantasy.
Well the afore mentioned Mr Wilson
was one of the authors, and ft is his
Illuminates Rap that he presents
alongside New York rock poet John
Giorno this evening. If you've ever

to the reviews this wiU tickle your
funny bone, bend your mind and chill
your marrow at the same time.
The other man on the bill, John
Giorno, is also worth a mention.
Even if you think poetry is a bit
namby this man is worth a look.
Delivering some outrageous material
to the accompaniment of a 'post
punk' b; h-t out
of even some of the most vttriefic of
the currently trendy ranting poets, in
addition to his appearances at
Chelsea Town Hall he is also on at
the fCA Theatre this Sunday and at
the Waterman* Arts Centre,
Brentford on Tuesday next week.
Giorno also features on an album out
currently 'Diamond In The Mouth Of
A Corpse' which includes
Coil/Cabs/Sonic Youth, and on
'You're the Guy I want to Snare My
Money With' which also includes
Laurie Anderson.
Another source of current
inspiration is the Andy Kershaw show
on late night Radio One on
Thursdays. I recently bought the
Vise to the Occasion' mini album
from current favourites The Unholy
Trinity, which is the first time in
years I've really felt like buying
* anything I've heard first on Radio
One. The Unholy Trinity formed out
of the remains of the Sid Presley
Experience and play heavy rock and
roil which seems to be somewhere
between Cream and the Sex Pistols
(this record should be in the Hatdane
library by now). Next I come to a
recent John Peel discovery. Half
Mao, Half Biscuit did one of the
fastest ever repeat sessions on that
program. Any attempt at description
of their album 'Back in the DHSS' is
doomed to failure. This a
masterpiece of alternative h
this is a scorching social
commentary, this a group I
doesn't like Nery's Hughes...
Man. Half Biscuit are the only group
I know who would introduce a song
with the line Jesus Christ, Come On
Down!', and I quite frankly creased
up at their rendition of Time Flys By
(when I'm the driver of a train)'. And
there is good news, Half Man Half
Biscuit are doing two gigs (their
'only ever London gigs') at the Bull
and Gate, Kentish Town on Tuesday
4th and Wednesday 5th February.
The Bull and Gate is 50 yards from
Kentish Town tube and the cost is
£3. The gig starts at 7.30pm.
Talking of records brings me on to
record shops—somewhere I seem to
spend a lot of time. If you only ever
shop in Our Price and the Virgin
Megastore then your musical tastes
are doomed to be restricted by
commercialism. There are in London
a vast selection shops catering for
all possible tastes and if you buy
records you're wasting your time if
yen don't browse a few of the more
off beat ones sometime. Many sell
secondhand records and here you
may well find cheap bargains in good
condition or records otherwise
unavailable. H is important to inspect
secondhand records before you buy
and the more reputable places will
insist you do this to avoid
complaints, certainly none should
, if a record looks dubious,.
even a tiny flaw, try asking to hear it
played and if in doubt leave it. If you
do buy records which have a cetain
amount of dirt (as opposed to
scratches) on you can try getting
them cleaned professionally. Unilet
in Bute Street, near South Ken
station, will do this at 30p a record.
The results can be quite good,
although miracles can't be worked.
Back to buying records. One place
you must check out is Hotting Hilt
Record and Tape Exchange who have
several shops in the area, the best is
in Notting Hilt Gate near the tube
station and there is another just
around the corner in Permbridge
Road. If you are desperate to dispose
of an old Wham! album or two they
also buy, but the price won't be very
good (even for Wham!) although you
might get more in terms of part
exchange.
The Notting Hill area is very well
provided for in terms of records,
especially less commercial music
The doyen of the independent record
labels, Rough Trade, have their shop
(the record company is elsewhere
these days) in Talbot Road, just off
the Portabello Read. They specialse
in all independant labels, not just
their own and also have a wide
selection of fanzines and general
record associated 'gubbins'. Just the
other side of the Portabello Road in
Blenheim Crescent is Plastic Passion
who seem to be one of the best
specialist second-hand stores in
London. Be warned they know their
stuff so you are unlikely to get many
super cheapo bargains, but if you are
looking for somewhere to find that
last obscure Stranglers single to
complete your collection or a deleted
Frank Zappa album, this is the place.
If you are just looking for a cheap
bargain, then instead of going along
to the rather dissappointing Tower
Records, you might try Cut Price
Records above Jean Machine, High
Street Ken who actually seem to
have quite a good selection of
bargains sometimes
Record collecting seems to be the
sort of casual bobby that can develop
into an obsession, so be warned. I
know of peeple rushing round
searching for albums so rare they
weren't even recorded. The American
(?) group the Residents recorded an
album called Hot Available' which in
typical style they did not release
(you think I'm joking). Well this
week 1
1
1 try and finish writing this
before I get tired and start slagging
people off. In the words of that great
Albanian mountain cyclist Eugene
Zhog 'running over Iguanas really
chokes np your wheels*.
FELIX Friday 24 January 15
