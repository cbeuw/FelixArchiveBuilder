Disarmament Talk
O n T u e s d a y at 1.15pm
M o n s i g n e u r B r u c e Kent
s p o k e to about 100 people
in M e c h a n i c a l Engineering
lecture theatre 220 about
C N D and it's role in nuclear
disarmament. During his 20
minutes talk Mgr. Kent
c o n d e m n e d the use of
nuclear w e a p o n s in
deterrance, claiming that
the present government's
defence policies could be
best described as suicide.
Mgr. Kent said that the
world has never been in a
better position to reduce
arms levels on all sides
and, with the aid of modern
spy satellites, to ensure
that all agreements are
upheld. He said that the
recent arms talks in G e n e v a
s h o w that the R u s s i a n s are
more willing then ever to
finalize s u c h agreements.
W h e n asked about
President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative
( S t a r Wars'), Mgr. Kent was
fast to air his views that it
was a waste of time and
money, saying that no s u c h
system could be 100%
effective against all types of
nuclear weapons. He
reiterated the opinion that
the money spent on Star
Wars c o u l d be better spent
on technical research more
directly relevant to society.
Mgr. Kent was highly
critical of Jane's Defense
Weekly who had published
a report claiming that the
G r e e n h a m C o m m o n Peace
c a m p had been infiltrated
by Russian agents. He
considered this a massive
slur on the w o m e n ' s
c a m p a i g n at G r e e n h a m and
was c o n c e r n e d that s u c h
unlikely rumour should be
brought to the attention of
the whole nation on the
front pages of T u e s d a y
morning's Press.
In s u m m i n g up his talk,
Mgr. Kent continued his
attack on British M e d i a by
claiming that the s h o w i n g
of the film 'Who Dares
Wins' on ITV on B o x i n g
Day was a deliberate
attempt to undermine the
work of C N D in this
country.

Residents
Revolt
Representatives from
Tizard Hall have sent a
letter to Peter Hallworth,
M a n a g i n g Surveyor of
Residences, outlining the
problems which have been
encountered by students
during the construction of
staircase kitchens in
Southside. A m o n g the
difficulties listed by Steve
Norton, the C h a i r m a n of
Tizard Hall Committee, are
the daily closure of the
existing kitchen between
8.30am and 4.30pm, and
the lack of warning given to
residents regarding areas
to be closed off. Students
have c o m p l a i n e d about the
removal of games machines
to an area where they
interrupt viewers in the T V
R o o m , and the general
disturbance caused by
w o r k m e n in the early
morning. Mr Norton claims
that the building work is
behind s c h e d u l e , and is
c o n c e r n e d that the
disturbances will eventually
run in to the s u m m e r term,
when students require quiet
for e x a m revision.
Green
Response
In their 'response to the
G r e e n Paper' C o l l e g e
authorities state that they
expect any cuts in funds
for universities to affect IC
less than the average, in
view of the fact that
Imperial has more than
o n c e expanded to meet the
Government's d e m a n d s for
production of more
qualified scientists,
engineers and
technologists. Imperial's
' a c k n o w l e d g e d position as
an outstanding research
centre' should also protect
it to s o m e extent despite
the overall cut of 10% for
the country's university
system envisaged in the
G r e e n Paper. T h e
response, however, also
states that any cuts
whatsoever will adversely
affect the functioning of IC,
both in teaching and
research.
Exhibition
There will be an exhibition
of paintings and prints by
E d n a L u m b in the C o n s o r t
Gallery, Sherfield Building,
from J a n u a r y 28 until
February 21.
Wardens
Change
Student R e s i d e n c e
C o m m i t t e e have proposed
major changes to the way
wardens are appointed. At
present wardens of houses
are postgraduates and
wardens of halls are staff.
S R C seeks to remove the
distinction, and adverts for
wardens will in future say
that the posts are open to
any member of C o l l e g e . All
wardens will be appointed
by a six member
committtee with
representatives of the
current wardens, C o l l e g e
and the U n i o n . S R C are
also seeking to appoint
wardens initially for three
years. T h e new method of
selecting wardens will be
tried when the warden of
Southwell H o u s e is c h o s e n .
Applications for this post
close today.
Day Of
Protest
Students all over the
country will be staging
protest actions today
against the Government's
proposals for education.
Following the
a n n o u n c e m e n t of a 2%
increase in grants, which
fails to match inflation, the
Government recently
a n n o u n c e d plans to remove
students' eligility to claim
benefits during the short
vacations.
T h e nationwide actions
have been instigated by the
National U n i o n of Students.
I C U has organised its own
petition, and will be
leafletting outside Harrods
this lunchtime. Protesters
s h o u l d meet in the
M e c h a n i c a l Engineering
foyer at 12.30pm.
