Having been s h o w n up by
the seven year olds playing
before us we were quick to
sign them up with U C C A .
However hopes of a win
were quickly dashed when
Brunei turned up with a full
team. H a n d i c a p p e d by the
a b s e n c e of 7 players and
the presence of Martin
Morris, IC made a g o o d
start winning the A and B
teams first games, helped
by g o o d scores from P
Stewart and G W o n g .
The C T e a m tried their
best not to e m b a r a s s
Brunei too m u c h as they
slid gallantly to a three-nil
defeat with a distinguished
rear guard action by R
Ingram.
In the s e c o n d of their
g a m e s the B T e a m were
heavily beaten and were
saved from a similar fate by
a g o o d performance by N
Brigham in their final game.
A s IC have no w o m e n
team (I w o n d e r why?) they
were now 6-0 d o w n . T h e A
team however prevented a
complete whitewash in the
last game when C h r i s
W h e e d o n managed to nose
us in front.
At the end of the match
our star player B Kwok
honoured us with his
presence by turning up two
hours late. S p e c i a l mention
also go to E Barfiedl, S
Barley and A Tuss, w h o
managed to turn up.
If y o u think y o u c a n d o
better than this you would
be more than w e l c o m e to
turn up on W e d n e s d a y .

IC dominated this g a m e
right from the start on a
very soggy, sloping pitch
when Per Dullforce s c o r e d
from the edge of the 'D'
within 5 minutes. A n o t h e r 2
goals from Per from about
2 feet away bought up his
hat-trick in record time.
Chalfont then m a n a g e d to
hold on until half-time. IC
subtley c h a n g e d their
formation from 4-3-3 to 2-
2-6 and the tactics paid off.
Ex-captain and minibus-
driver C h r i s Harrison
scored from a short corner.

Skipper Richard Ellis
scored (at last) from a
g o o d set-piece and five
minutes later Mark Mueller
blasted the ball in off the
post. Straight from the
restart a quick 1-2 between
J o h n S p e n c e r and Richard
Ellis led to a smart, and
very muddy, goal from the
latter. T h e final goal from
c a m e from Mark Mueller
again, after a few
deflections, making a
c o n v i n c i n g win and a g o o d
start to the new year.
M a n y thanks to H u g h

minibus this week.

IC's first g a m e after
C h r i s t m a s p r o d u c e d an
emphatic victory, their
s e c o n d 4-0 win against
C X W M this season.
IC spent the first half
entrenched in C X W M ' s half
and duly took the lead after
15 minutes when a G u y
P o p p y long throw was
headed off by a defender
into the path of Paul
Bravery w h o s e falling
volley from the edge of the
penalty box flew past the
keeper.
Despite continual
pressure and several long
range attempts including
one 20 yard drive from Alex
L u n g h i w h i c h hit the post,
IC failed to increase their
lead and reached half time
leading 1-0.
ICs s e c o n d c a m e midway
through the s e c o n d half
when T o m Dutton's cross
was only half cleared
allowing Alex Lunghi to
head h o m e from 6 yards.
Dave L y n n e m a d e the
score 3-0 when he latched
on to a through-ball from
Paul Bravery and drove the
ball past the advancing
keeper. T h e C X W M keeper
prevented IC from
increasing their advantage
with a superb save from
S h a u n T h o m a s ' ferociously
hit volley.
IC c o m p l e t e d the scoring
in the closing minutes
when T o m Dutton's c o r n e r
was headed h o m e by Dave
Lynne, for his s e c o n d goal
of the game, with G u y
P o p p y marshalling the ball
of the game.
A g o o d start after the
Christmas break with IC's
new central defensive
pairing of R o b C l a r k e and
C h r i s E n g b e r g proving very
solid.
