To be topical....
Once more, the rules, because there‚Äôs bound
to be someone who hasn‚Äôt tried their hand
at the ‚Äòlink yet: draw a single closed loop by
vertically and horizontally joining the dots
so that the numbered squares are surround-
ed by the corresponding number of lines.
The numbers in each row and
column show you how many
groups of black squares are
in a row or column, as well as
how many black squares each
group consists of. Filling in the
grid produces a pretty picture,
which in turn produces points
if you send it in.

Connect all the is-
lands with bridges
so that you can get
from any island to any
other one. There are
restrictions, though:
the bridges have to be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must
not intersect. You can
have up to two bridg-
es between any two
islands and, last but
not least, each island
must have exactly as
many bridges stem-
ming from it as the
number on it.
Fill the cells with a
continuous line (the
‚Äúsnake‚Äù) that does
not pass through a
cell twice, doesn‚Äôt
intersect with itself,
and passes through
all white boxes. The
numbers show you
how many times the
snake turns in the
corresponding row
or column. The snake
enters and exits the
grid at the shown
points (and only
those points). There
are some hints to get
you started.
