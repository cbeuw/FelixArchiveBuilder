Google Nexus 4, worth it?
Can Google’s “cheap” phone stand up to the high-end without killing your budget?
FRIDAY 25 JANUARY 41
Yong Wen Chua Writer
The best eﬀort at a Nexus phone so
far, albeit with some teething issues.
When Google announced the
Nexus One phone in 2010, it was not
too much of a success. There was a
lack of consumer interest, save the
enthusiasts. The phone had great
hardware, at that time, but it failed to
capture the attention of consumers.
On the software front, stock or vanil-
la Android was an ugly mess – other
manufacturers had to slap on their
own “skins” to bring some kind of
aesthetics to the user interface (UI).
The next two iterations were not
that great either. The Nexus S and
the Galaxy Nexus had pretty stand-
ard hardware at their release, and
weren’t that exciting. Nexus 4 is their
latest attempt and it has achieved
considerable success on many fronts,
while failing on several others.
The Nexus 4 was designed in col-
laboration with LG, a manufacturer
who is not that well known in the
Android ecosystem, leading at least
initially to some scepticism with
the device. It featured the top of the
line hardware at the time of release,
and even now at the time of writing.
Phones of early 2013, at least, will
be matching the speciﬁcations of
the Nexus 4. It features a Quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon System-on-
Chip along with a generous 2 GB
of RAM. The phone looks stunning.
At just £279 for an unlocked phone
bought directly from Google, the
phone is very competitively priced.
But the hardware is also where the
phone fails, in some ways.
There are three ways in which the
phone’s hardware falls short. Firstly,
thephonehasanoticeablelackofsup-
port for Long-term Evolution (LTE),
the 4G technology that is widespread
in the US and is becoming more
available in the UK, and elsewhere.
Google has (in)famously decided to
exclude LTE support to prevent is-
sues with carrier lock-ins and other
licensing shenanigans. Secondly, the
phone has limited ﬂash memory sup-
port, coming in at only 8 GB and 16
GB. Finally, Google has opted to cov-
er the back of the phone with glass.
Whilst this makes the phone look

might be
mere minor
annoyances
to some peo-
ple (and the
author, admit-
tedly), there
exists a larger
issue: availabil-
ity.
Google has had
severe issues with
future. This will
be nothing, but
helpful to grow the
number of Android
users, and make more
money for Google.

The News Bubble
A phone, a phone, my degree for a phone. Of course if you are still
reading this box, your phone is very important to you! Well, as you
noticed, we have done a pure smartphone-based issue. So the news
bubble will also be all about one of the fastest tech sectors around!
Sony Xperia Z
At CES, Sony showed off the Z. This quite well designed phone also
happens to be waterproof. Admittedly this includes plastic coverings
for all openings, like charger and earphone plug. However it was still
very impressive when the phone was dunked in a fish bowl. However
diving with your Z is still not on. Shame!
Bendy Phones
Also at CES, Samsung showed off its first prototypes of their bendy
phones. While Nokia was the first to be linked with this technology,
Samsung has actually done something. The screens, based on flexible
OLED tech, are quite impressive. The implications of this are quite
profound - I mean, a wearable phone!?!
Cheaper 4G?
For all you who read this title, expecting a good deal, I am sorry to
disappoint you. EE did announce cheaper contracts for their 4G data
deals, but for most of us (i.e. Cash-strapped students) £21 a months,
sim only for 500mb (which you will blow through before you can
say EE) seems a bit much. However this move by EEs is apparently
a preemptive strike against release of the 4G networks of the other
providers. Hopefully the added competition in this new area, will lead
to cheaper prices, and a possibility for even the poorest of us to blaze
through the internet on our phones.

Jelly Bean
(Android 4.2)
is the best
version of
Android so far
since launch day has been low. This
is apparently due to the demand for
the phone being ten times than that
which Google expected. It is virtu-
ally impossible to buy the phone
directly from Google at the time of
writing, and thus enjoy the highly
competitive price. Sure, you could
go to Carphone Warehouse or opt
to purchase the phone on contract,
but you would be paying more than
necessary. The software front of the
phone, however, is admittedly pretty
perfect, in my opinion.
Jelly Bean (Android 4.2), is the best
version of Android so far. The UI has
been polished and looks aesthetically
pleasing and modern. This puts
the rather dated UI of iOS on
iPhones and iPads to shame.
I would argue that the stock
version of Android is now
the best version of Android
to use. Skins that manu-
facturers like HTC and
Samsung slap onto the
UI now feel extraneous
and seem to bog down
the performance of the
UI. The software is
lag free, or buttery-
smooth as Google
would like to say.
The new features of
this latest iteration
of Jelly Bean has
been highlighted
in my previous

ily of Nexus”
