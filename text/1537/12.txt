A new kid on the block
his week The Tab Impe-
rial launched, a new online
news source that focuses
on news and life of being
student at Imperial and
around London.
The Tab will be updating hopefully
daily, and we are aiming to be your one
stop shop for news and views online after
you’ve ﬁnished ranting on sexism com-
ment articles on the Felix website.
Much like Felix, we are constantly
looking for writers for both features and
news. Unlike Felix, we are run entirely on
a part time basis so there are lots of op-
portunities available for you to really take
control of a large portion of the site and
dowithitwhatyouwill!TheTabnetwork
is a well-known national student journal-
ism brand, and if you are interested in
onlinejournalism,thisisareallygreatop-
portunity to get some good experience.
As we’re online, if you have any funny
videos or photos from around campus
then we can be the place to share them
with the wider community. We’re also
looking for enthusiastic animators and
photoshoppers, as well as video editors
and presenters to produce content for
the site.
So where to get started? Well you can
visit our website imperial.tab.co.uk, like
us on Facebook at facebook.com/TheTa-
bImperial or follow us on Twitter at @
