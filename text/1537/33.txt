A Damn Fine Cup of Coffee
Edward Bals takes us back to the 90s with Twin Peaks
win Peaks manages to
do the almost impos-
sible; mixing sex, vio-
lence, mystery and even
the odd dosage of the
supernatural into a heady whirl-
wind that is sure to draw you in to
its strange world. The series itself
is from the early ‘90s and has been
recommended to me time and time
again by my family and other people
of that same, shall we say, ‘mature’
age.
The show is set in a small town
close in North America called Twin
Peaks, opening with the discovery
of the body of the local homecom-
ing queen, Laura Palmer. The ques-
tion of ‘who killed Laura Palmer?’
becomes the driving force behind
the story, slowly unravelling the
fibre of the seemingly idyllic small
town life. The show doesn’t play out
as a straight up whodunit, but rath-
er as a sort of surreal soap opera,
with its fair share of love triangles
and intersecting storylines.
The idea for the series came from
the minds of David Lynch and Mark
Frost. Lynch was the mind behind
films like Blue Velvet and Mulhol-
land Drive, and in Twin Peaks his
surrealistic touch is apparent, with
Twin Peaks mixing this surreal-
ism with small town American life.
The combination doesn’t necessar-
ily sound like it should work but it
makes for compelling watching.
The show also brings us the bril-
liant Kyle MacLachlan (former star
of Lynch’s Blue Velvet and Dune)
as FBI special agent Dale Cooper
who is called in to investigate the
death of Laura Palmer. MacLachlan
manages to walk the knife edge of
straight faced acting even whilst
exploring some of Cooper’s odder
character quirks. Cooper’s inherent
oddness is best displayed by his ex-
planation of coming by a new crime
solving technique, which also made
him aware of the plight of the Tibet-
an people. I did say that the show
does become a bit surreal at times.
The music is excellent as well,
with its haunting themes and cool
jazz perfectly complementing the
mood of the series. ‘Laura’s Theme’
is suitably haunting and is used, re-
peatedly, to great effect throughout
the series, and the fact that this can
be reused to evoke so many differ-
ent feelings is a testament to the ge-
nius of the composer of the music
for the series, Angelo Badalamenti.
Julee Cruise also deserves a men-
tion for her ethereal vocals, com-
plementing Badalamenti’s music.
The show remains engaging
throughout the whole first series
with the most cliff-hanger filled
ending to a series that I have ever
seen, and the second season, de-
spite a small dip in quality during
the middle, is generally very good,
with the last few episodes being es-
pecially noteworthy.
The best format in which to get
the show is its Gold Box Edition,
which contains the two series, both
versions of the pilot episode and a
bundle of special features for all of
you people out there who have too
much time on their hands. ‘A Slice
of Lynch’ is one of the better of-
ferings from the special features,
bringing David Lynch together with
some of the main cast characters to
reminisce about the series.

The end of January is ﬁnally approach-
ing, bringing with it two wonderful
things: 1. exams are almost over and
2. all of our favourite shows are back
with new episodes after the winter
break!
Grey’s Anatomy continues to be
melodramatic and entertaining. I can
always rely on the doctors from Seat-
tle Grace Hospital to be annoying and
endearing at the same time. Regular
viewers of the show know that the ep-
isodes are driven by the relationships
between the characters and I’m happy
to see Callie and Arizona, as well as
Cristina and Owen being happy to-
gether again.
How I Met Your Mother has been
renewed for one more, ﬁnal, season –
yay! There is a light at the end of the
tunnel as we get ever closer to the big
reveal. The latest episode sees Barney
going through ‘one night stand with-
drawal’ and Lily and Marshall looking
for ways to spice up their sex life after
the birth of their ﬁrst child. Overall it
was a very enjoyable episode.
Smash is back – kind of. The actual
season premiere isn’t until the 6th
of February but the ﬁrst episode was
leaked and the second season looks
like it’s going to be just as good as, if
not better, than the ﬁrst one. The mu-
sic and singing continue to be amaz-
ing.
The Big Bang Theory takes the top
spot yet again. I know many people
have tired of this show, but I still re-
ally enjoy it and the latest episode
was one of the best this season. It was
wonderful to see Penny, Bernadette
and Amy read comic books to under-
stand why their boyfriends love them
so much. I can deﬁnitely relate to the
heated discussion that follows.
A deep vein of surrealism
