Our pick of 2013
Maciej Matuszewski recommends five great upcoming SF books
I don’t read much modern literary ﬁc-
tion so José Saramago’s Blindness is
not something that I would usually
pick up. I am, however, always looking
to expand my horizons and so, having
heard good things about the book, I
decided to give it a go.
Set at an unspeciﬁed time in an
unspeciﬁed country the novel begins
with an outbreak of a mysterious ill-
ness that makes its victims blind.
Thanks to a health minister more in-
competent than Andrew Lansley and
Jeremy Hunt combined the blindness
soon spreads throughout the country
– plunging it into chaos.
The novel, however, does not focus
on the large-scale consequences of
this disaster, instead choosing to stick
with a small group of people. We see
them deal with their initial shock and
confusion and try to adapt to the al-
most insurmountable obstacles that
they face, only to witness the fabric
of society to begin to collapse around
them.
The confusion inherent in univer-
sal blindness is brilliantly expressed
by the style of the novel itself. Most
noticeable is the lack of any speech
marks – with dialogue being integrat-
ed with the rest of the text. The reader
is forced to concentrate to distinguish
between speakers, or even between
dialogue and narration.
Furthermore, none of the characters
are given names, instead being re-
ferred to by descriptions like “the doc-
tor” or “the ﬁrst blind man”. This helps
to add to the universal and timeless
feel of the novel. Blindness presents a
vivid portrait of both how important
our sense of sight is and how easily we
can begin to lose our humanity when
faced with an impossible crisis.
In the kingdom of the blind...

FRIDAY 25 JANUARY
30
Dead Ever After
Charlaine Harris
Released May 7
The ﬁnal novel of the Sookie Stack-
house ﬁnally hits the shelves. While
the series could never claim to be
intellectually satisfying it has always
been good fun as a guilty pleasure and
this book looks set to be a ﬁtting con-
clusion. With the sixth season of True
Blood, the hit TV show based on the
series, set to begin in June this is the
perfect opportunity to catch up with
the books that started it all.
The Unreal and the Real
Ursula K. Le Guin
Released January 3
There are few SF authors who could
claim to be most inﬂuential than
Ursula Le Guin. Including both
acknowledged classics, like the award
winning The Ones Who Walk Away
from Omelas as well as less known
works, this two volume set is great for
both fans and Le Guin novices. Each
story beautifully displays Le Guin’s
skills, both in characterisation and
plotting as well as in writing style.
The Republic of Thieves
Scott Lynch
Released July 13
The long awaited third novel in Lynch’s
Gentleman Bastard series. Lynch is
rightfully acclaimed for having created
an intricate and unique fantastical set-
ting heavily inﬂuences by Renaissance
Italy. While the previous novel was let
down by poor characterisation it was
still one of the best 2007 fantasies. The
perfect opportunity to get your epic
fantasy ﬁx – at least until the latest
Patrick Rothfuss novel is released.
The Human Division
John Scalzi
Released May 14
Acclaimed author and Science Fiction
Writers of America President John
Scalzi returns to his Old Man’s War
universe with an experimental ‘epi-
sodic’ novel. Each chapter is partially
stand-alone and will be released in-
dividually in the months prior to the
full book’s release date. Having been
favourably compared to the works of
Richard Heinlein and John Campbell
this is certainly worth checking out.
The Ocean at the End of the Lane
Neil Gaiman
Released June 18
After eight long years genre favourite
Neil Gaiman is ﬁnally set to return to
adult ﬁction with The Ocean at the
End of the Lane. Gaiman has been
relatively quiet about this book but, as
with his previous work, you should ex-
pect a well written and deeply atmos-
pheric gothic tale. Gaiman has won
more awards than I have space to list
and, in my opinion, has never written
a bad novel so this book is a must.
