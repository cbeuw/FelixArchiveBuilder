FRIDAY 25 JANUARY

Tom Ravalde
What would Jesus do?
For nonbelievers to properly engage wth Christians, they must
learn about the life of Jesus, says Tom Ravalde
et the dialogue begin.’
So began Rory Fenton’s
thoughtful piece last week
(‘Faitheism: the impor-
tance of dialogue’) – en-
couraging the religious and irreligious
alike to ‘look for the common ground’
and ‘work together’ against extremism
for a better society. As a Christian, I
welcome this engagement from the
(so called) ‘faitheists’ – it’s certainly
a refreshing change from the hostile
rhetoric spouted by Dawkins et al.
The purpose of this response is to
suggest that we need to broaden the
horizons of much of our atheist-be-
liever-interfaith dialogue, in order to
have a meaningful discussion. What
do I mean by that? My worry is that
the ‘dialogue’ is always on the terms
of the faitheist. The faitheist (under-
standably) deﬁnes the world’s prob-
lems as they see them, and then wants
to work with religion to oppose them.
But what if we view the world’s situa-
tion in very diﬀerent ways? Solutions
require a correct understanding of the
problem (ever misread an exam ques-
tion…?!) The Christian world-view
has a far deeper explanation of the evil
we experience than faitheism allows.
The hatred and bigotry described in
last week’s article is undoubtedly rep-
rehensible, but it is a manifestation of
a more fundamental predicament – a
world that’s turned its back on its lov-
ing Creator – this is (broadly) what
Christians mean by ‘sin’.
Allow me to illustrate what I’m say-
ing with an incident from the life of
Jesus Christ – surely any meaning-
ful conversation between atheist and
Christian must try to understand him?
In Luke’s Gospel, a paralysed man is
brought to Jesus – a man who in First
Century Israel would have had very
limited prospects. At this point, the
faitheist would call on people of all
religions and none to work together
to improve this man’s well-being and
life-chances. Shockingly, Jesus sees a
need greater than just the physical –
saying, ‘My friend, your sins are for-
given’! Jesus tells us our biggest prob-
lem is to stand unforgiven before God.
His same words also tell us something
staggering about himself. The reli-
gious leaders are outraged – they con-
sider Jesus a blasphemer: ‘Who can
forgive sins but God alone?’ But Jesus
is ready to prove his identity by heal-
ing the man: ‘I tell you, get up, take
your mat and go home.’
Thus, any honest dialogue with
Christianity must conclude that Jesus
oﬀers a solution in an altogether dif-
ferent category than that oﬀered by
human endeavour, meeting a more
fundamental need than that which
concerns most of us. Whilst conver-
sation remains restricted to faitheist
presuppositions, one could be for-
given for thinking that all this talk of
‘dialogue’ and ‘listening’ is merely a
pretence. Could it be that faitheism
elevates itself above religion, and uses
it for its own ends?
So what form should ‘dialogue’ take?
Let’s be bold enough to take discus-
sion to the ‘uncommon ground’, ask-
L
‘
ing questions about where the heart
of humanity’s problem really lies.
Let’s dare to allow the possibility that
the solution lies outside of our own
abilities, and is found in a supernatu-
ral Saviour. Only then can all wrongs
truly be righted. If you think that dia-
logue surrounding these huge ques-
tions important, then why not engage
with the Christian Union? Friendly
dialogue is at the forefront of their
agenda. Starting next Monday, they
are hosting ‘What if …’ – a week for
anyone to explore the life and claims
of Jesus, and ask any questions (www.
iccu.co.uk/qr). We’d love to see you
there.
Let the dialogue continue.
Jesus is
your buddy
