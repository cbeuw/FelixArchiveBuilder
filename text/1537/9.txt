Caroline Wood introduces you to the world of Social Enterprise

FRIDAY 25 JANUARY
the anxiety of choosing a risky ca-
reer path as an entrepreneur whilst
friends are securing jobs on well re-
spected graduate schemes. In fact
most large companies now either ac-
tively support young entrepreneurs,
or at least perceive entrepreneurship
as a desirable trait. Being involved in a
social enterprise at university doesn’t
necessarily tie you to a career path
in entrepreneurship and more likely
than not is likely to aid your applica-
tion to any job! The key message here
is that social enterprise at university
is not just something that those want-
ing to ‘become entrepreneurs’ should
explore. It can be fun, interesting and
rewarding for everyone.
The Venture Catalyst
Challenge ‘13
University is a great time to get in-
volved in new projects and experi-
ment with things that may be out-
side of your comfort zone. Maybe
you can’t fail your degree, but you
can certainly try to learn a new
sport, a new language or join a new
society with absolutely no pressure
to be good at it. Trying to start your
own social enterprise should be no
different.
That’s why this year ICStartup
(a collaboration between Imperial
Hub, Imperial Innovations and Im-
perial Entrepreneurs) is bringing
you the Venture Catalyst Challenge,
your chance to develop an enter-
prise idea. This year the focus is
on digital and social enterprise. It’s
offering students the chance to win
anything from £500 to £250K to de-
velop their idea, as well as providing
expert support and advice via free
workshops and masterclasses.
Imperial Hub is responsible for
the social enterprise aspect of the
competition. Entrants are encour-
aged to submit an idea for any UK
based social enterprise and to be
as creative as possible. However,
Imperial Hub has highlighted three
social issues in the following areas
that may help spark your imagina-
tion.
• Food
• Consumption
• The Elderly
(See poster (right) for more de-
tails.)
All you need to do is submit an
idea by the 28th January to www.ic-
startup.com/vc and then ICStartup
will help you develop it! What are
you waiting for?

FOOD
COLLABORATIVE
CONSUMPTION
THE ELDERLY
1/3 of the food we use in
the UK is wasted, and much
of the food we consume
has a high carbon footprint
How can we minimise
our food waste and
reduce the carbon
footprint of our food?
The way we use and comsu-
me stuff is changing. We
now care less about owners-
hip and more about access
How can we use
collaborative con-
sumption to help us
consume less and
connect communities?
There are now over 10 million
people over the age of 65
living in the UK, and the
number is on the increase
How can we help the
elderly continue with
their everyday
activities and prevent
isolation?
Or, submit an idea tackling any UK based social issue of your choice
