the turnip
Imperial semi warm
statements
People give terms of weak praise ac-
knowledging that they don’t dislike
the person but also don’t know them
that well and would describe them
as “someone on my course” not “my
friend/mate”.
Example: “Darren is okay. He’s not
that funny, clever, or interesting in any
way, but I can’t imagine him trying
to fuck your girlfriend, so I guess he’s
worth nodding at when you pass him
on the way home.”
Spotted: Imperial Exams
You send in a description of the per-
son that was making you fail your
exams by being sexy and wearing a
revealing outﬁt. Probably followed by
a shit joke about tangents and curves.
Example: “To that ﬁt guy making my
legs diﬀuse open and causing active
transport of gushing liquid unto a rap-
idly rising puddle on the ﬂoor: call me
please. Turn around and say hi. I can
see you have no clue how to answer the
ﬁrst half of the paper. I’ll help, in ex-
change for a little something.”
Imperial Masturbation
Reports
You send in a report to log every time
you knock one out. If possible, this is
speciﬁc to people you are thinking of
at the time of ejaculation. Please note
that Facebook have already requested
this not be set up as it would be inun-
dated by men sending in reports and
crash their server.
Example: “Just had a bit of a sesh
in my room. Hoping nobody heard.
Made no noise except for some
mild groaning while I was get-
ting into it. Watched some “Red-
head” stuﬀ on RedTube. Hope halls
don’t ﬁnd out. Right, I’m about to

Imperial Lame Philosophical
Quotes
This is the slightly diﬀerent one as it
wouldn’t be anonymous. The main
point of this is to publicly shame
those who post shit ‘deep’ thoughts
as their status and think people give a
fuck. Would be a great way for people
YAY I was on
Spotted. It means
I’m fit right? People
aren’t taking the
piss are they?
to know who to unsubscribe to. More
of a public service really.
Example: “‘People and work are all
one in the same. They are all just ener-
gy ﬂoating on the sea that we call con-
sciousness. We are merely perceptions
of a greater thought. – such inspiring
words I once heard on a TED talk or
something.’ James Anderson, 3rd Year
Physics Student”
Roundup of the news this week
President Barack Obama realised
halfway through his inauguration this
week that he can now pretty much say
what he wants. The President went on
to state in his speech that he could
“really use a hot dog right now” and
that Americans can “go fuck them-
selves” now that the President had
begun his second term.
Rap lyrics of
the week
“Young, black and famous,
With money hanging out the anus”
Right off the bat, the title of the
song is stupid. The double negative
means that you are actually imply-
ing that everyone can hold you
down, which isn’t what you are
trying to say.
Now let’s move on to the part
where you shove money up your
arse. I get you mean that you are so
rich that money is just hanging out
of your arse. That’s just an impos-
sibility though. So, to achieve this,
you have to walk around with “dol-
lar bills” shoved up your backside.
That’s got to be uncomfortable
when walking around. Plus, when
you bring a girl back to your house
she’ll probably be a bit freaked out
and disgusted when you take off
your pants and say “oh, hang on
baby, I just need to get this money
out of my bum. You know me and
my anus money hanging policy.”
Also, is that still legal tender any-
where? Why does this note smell,
yeah, erm, I sort of just shoved it up
my arse for a bit.
Mase: “Can’t Nobody
Hold Me Down”
“Can you blow my whistle
baby,whistle baby. Let me know,
Girl I’m gonna show you how to do
it, and we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close”
So, let’s establish this: blow my
whistle = suck my dick. You’re go-
ing to show her how to do that? I
don’t think anyone wants to be just
about to get with you and then be
forced to watch a demonstration
of you giving head to, presumably,
a banana or something.
Flo Rida: “Whistle”
Obama: “I just don’t give a
fuck anymore”
In international news, France ﬁnally
enters the War on Terrorism 5000
miles to the west of and 12 years af-
ter the other major Western powers
by invading Mali. French President
France joins the fray
François Holland stated that sending
2000 troops to settle in a relatively
unknown country that many people
are unfamiliar with was “basically
the same” as invading Afghanistan
and Iraq with almost ten times that
number. “We’re as cool and edgy as
the other western powers now,” added
the President.

In lighter developments, Bradford
City gave hope Tuesday to all peren-
nial losers and no-hopers by making
the League Cup ﬁnal.
Nadal: “I was deffo injured”
Finally, in sporting news, world num-
ber 5, David Ferrer, bids to become the
ﬁrst Spanish male to win a Grand Slam
in over 9 months when he takes on #1
ranked Djokovic in the Australian Open
semis. The lengthy absence of Spanish
players from major honours is mainly
due to Rafael Nadal’s nine-month, face
saving break whereby the former world
number 1 and 11 time Grand Slam
champion pretended to be injured in or-
der to cover up for his highly embarrass-
ing loss to Lukas Rosol at Wimbledon.
Bradford City win?
In the wake of Spotted: Imperial Central Library (now also Ethos) and Imperial
Compliments, here are suggestions for new groups someone can make...
