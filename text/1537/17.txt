Sometimes it feels like campaigning is a
dirty word at Imperial. It’s time for that to
change. There are lots of you out there
who feel passionately about causes and
would like to get your message out in
the wider Imperial community – and
now there is support for you to do that!
We have made it easier for you to create
campaign teams, bid for funding and get
your message out there.
Whether you want to highlight an
international political situation to students,
or campaign for better exam feedback in
your department; then the Union is here
We want your campaigns!
to support you through your campaign!
Other examples could include lobbying
College on a particular environmental
issue, or campaigning about student
mental health issues. If your club, society
or project would like to run a campaign
then you can get involved too!
We have already had interest from
students interested in running campaigns
about cycling and the plight of Syrian
students. Examples of campaigns run
by students in other Unions include a
S.H.A.G. week, Disability Awareness
weeks and National Student Mental
NSS - get your responses in
The National Student Survey gives
ﬁnal years the chance to show their
satisfaction to the general public on the
education they have received here at
Imperial.
The College’s overall response rate
was 28% on Wednesday and each
subject will need 50% for the data to
be published. If this isn’t the case, your
subject will disappear from national
league tables = massive implications!!
Remember to be honest when you are
ﬁlling it in, as prospective students and
other interested parties will be using this
data to compare the quality of education
each university and course offers.
The NSS also raises important issues
that College and the Union can respond
to. Every year the Union publishes a
response to the NSS with the aim of
improving the student experience across
the whole College.
Last year, 71% of ﬁnal years ﬁlled in
the NSS and we are hoping to beat
this percentage to give a more fully
representative view of how satisﬁed
Imperial’s students are. To help make
the survey as useful as possible we
have a few tips to those who have yet to
complete it:

Keep up-to-date with your Sabbaticals at:
1. Rate your entire degree, not your ﬁnal
year.
The NSS is very different to SOLE.
Use SOLE to discuss the positives and
negatives of your year and NSS for the
positives and negatives of your whole
degree.
2. Don’t be neutral.
On many questions you will these
options: strongly agree, slightly agree,
neutral, slightly disagree, strongly
disagree. Neutral responses give us no
indication as to whether things need
improving or are going very well. Make
your voice count.
3. Give detailed comments on open text
boxes.
There are free-text boxes on the survey.
Be as detailed as possible if you want to
make an impact.
So if you are a ﬁnal year, ﬁll in the survey
