It has been well over 8 weeks since
ICURFC have taken the ﬁeld. This
winter the bitter English weather has
been brutal but this gave the team
time to heal up and, in some cases, fat-
ten up. A very strong squad took the
two hour trip to Eastbourne, home of
sun seeking pensioners and apparently
Brighton rugby. We travelled through
rain and snow to be greeted by a pitch
that had seen better days.
Keen to avoid the arctic tempera-
ture we ran out for only a quick warm
up. Although Brighton play in the
league below they had beaten table
topping St Barts meaning they were
not to be underestimated.
Captain Jack, returning after injur-
ing his ankle earlier the season, gave
one of his inspiring team talks punc-
tuated with blood curdling screams
of ‘This is Sparta’.
George Lane kicked oﬀ the game
and the team got oﬀ to a great start
with strong tackling leading to a
penalty. This dominance continued
for the next four minutes where we
saw the ﬁrst yellow of the game. Toby
Spittle’s jovial behaviour around the
breakdown landed him with a well
deserved, albeit poor, headbutt, giv-
ing the Brighton loose head a much
needed 10 minute breather. His
claims of vengeance left Toby quak-
ing in his boots. The resulting pen-
alty left Imperial with a line out on
the opposition 22. A well executed
line out lead to an unstoppable maul,
where the pack jogged to the line
leaving Michael ‘Maurice’ O’Connell
an easy ﬁnish. George Lane con-
verted from the touch line to make it
7-0. As the temperature dropped we
could see the opposition struggling
and Captain Jack capitalised with a
strong ten metre juggernaut through
the opposition line. A ﬂuﬀed conver-
sion left us 12 points clear. Keeping
up the pressure, Imperial earned a
5 metre scrum just minutes later,
and an already tired Jon ‘Team Talk’
Hardisty picked and popped to man
of the match Scott Fraser who made a
slick pass to Nathan ‘Brucie’ Fitzpat-
rick leaving him with a simple ﬁnish.
After a quick kick return, IC again
found themselves within touching
distance of the Brighton line.
However, after a taste of glory, Na-
than got greedy and decided to leach
onto the back of a rolling maul and
claims to have scored the fourth try
of the match. Another quality strike
from George Lane led to a missed
conversion leaving the score 22-0 at
half time.
Despite the domination Imperial
showed in the ﬁrst half, the team
knew they had to raise their game in
the second half in order to deliver the
performance they knew they were
capable of. Impact subs included
Pierre “Gross” L’Bour who replaced
Tom “lean mean one-ﬁfteen” Hansen
who had made a slightly above aver-
age contribution in the ﬁrst half. The
second half started with Imperial
now playing up-hill, but determined
to maintain their clean sheet. After
a lengthy exchange of tactical kicks
from both teams, ending with a sliced
clearance kick from Scotty ‘Too Hot-
ty’ Fraser, prompting jeers from the
spectators and resulting in Brighton
putting much of the pressure on Im-
perial. After winning a penalty after
a huge defensive performance Im-
perial found themselves with a line
out 35m from the opponents try line
and again the maul was called upon.
Imperial nailed another line out and
had the maul going forward; time
after time the forwards hit the maul
forcing the Brighton pack into a fast
retreat. An awesome surge of power
from Imperial propelled the maul
into the 22 and eventually over the
line for impact sub L’Bour, who was
already pumped from the “cafe” from
his thermos, to complete a devastat-
ing display of dominance from the
Imperial pack to extend the lead to
27-0.
Brighton’s kick oﬀ preceded an-
other spell of pressure from them.
Although Imperial’s discipline was
hurting them it was made up by re-
lentless tackling. Eventually a turno-
ver was forced and a box kick from
Scott Fraser was recovered by Brucie
and again Imperial found themselves
in Brighton’s half. Imperial applied
pressure and found themselves once
again inside the 22 setting J Flan up
for a carbon copy of his ﬁrst try as he
thrust once again through the Bright-
on defence. Notable mentions must
also go to “massive” Mike O’Connell
for looking like he was mounting a
horse and for Big George Lane’s ﬁrst
ever low tackle. A satisﬁed but not
ecstatic Imperial left the ﬁeld happy
with the win but knowing improve-
ments need to be made. The major
achievement was managing to ﬁnish
with a nil score (34-0) against a team
that put 2 tries past the Medics...
Bring on Varsity.
With the highest number of mem-
bers in the history of the club, it has
been one of the most successful years
for ICSM Badminton in both team
performance and social events. All
of our teams have put on their best
performance yet with the women’s
and mixed doubles’ team currently
taking the top spot in their leagues.
The women’s team remains unde-
feated since the start of the season
and they have continued the win-
ning streak with the most recent
8-0 white-wash against King Col-
lege London on Wednesday. Sarah
and our team Captain, Miko, have
stepped up to the challenge of being
the singles players for matches after
the departure of one of our great sin-
gles players, Ayla, who was a Dutch
student interning at Imperial College
for 4 months. With 2 sets won for
each singles games, our two doubles
pairs, Peachy & Annie and Hannah &
myself, managed to win the remain-
ing four games to give us a perfect
team victory.
The mixed team had one of their
toughest matches against St. Barts
(Queen Mary Medics) at our home
ground. Our three mixed doubles
pairs, Annie (captain) & Bob, Locha-
ni & Tom and Yan & myself, put on
our best performance and managed
to narrowly win 5-4, but unfortu-
nately one of the players was injured
during their match and the game had
to be forfeited.
The men’s 1st and 2nd teams have
displayed good performances as they
are both respectably placed in their
leagues, under the sturdy leadership
of Ananth and Jonhson & Lochani
for the 1st and 2nd teams respec-
tively.
Aside from the team successes this
year, one of our major social achieve-
ments was the tour to Enschede,
Netherlands over the Christmas and
New Year holiday. We had the high-
est number of members in the history
of ICSM Badminton to come on tour!
We took part in a 4-day tournament
at the University of Twente, with 8
am wake-up calls every day follow-
ing on from the fun evening antics.
Everyone won at least one of their
matches throughout the competition
and overall we came second (out of
32) in the tournament. The best way
to celebrate this great result was the
New Year’s party at the University of
Twente’s very own Viking’s Bar with
everyone dressed up to the theme
of “Joyful Japan”: an attempt to stop
people from dressing up as exploding
nuclear plants or nuclear explosion
victims, which, as most people would
have guessed, was a fail. We had
Japanese characters from the Mario
brothers to the two Pikachus which
we protected from Team Rocket for
the whole night.
It has been a great year and great
fun with the club so far. I wish the
success continues and best of luck in
the remaining matches for all teams!
Fingers crossed the women’s team
will get promoted to division 1 next
season and the mixed team to the
premier division!
ICSM Badminton still unbeaten

These two are more gentle
with their shuttlecocks...
