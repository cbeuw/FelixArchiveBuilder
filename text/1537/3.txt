We know how busy you
are, that's why we've made
this competition fit around
the student life
All that's needed by
the 28th January is a
few lines.
Then we'll help you to
turn it into something
awesome
It’s easy to say“I’ll start some
thing when I have THE idea”
but the key is making a start
on something today
Did you know that
Twitter started off as
a travel website and
Groupon as a social
action site
(by a student!)
We recognise that you may
not be 100% sure about
whether you want to start
your own thing
But even if you think
you'll probably get a
'proper job' nothing
looks better than
entrepreneurial skills
on a CV
