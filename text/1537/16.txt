Not going hard? Go Homecoming
Fellow students! Fancy an opportu-
nity to enjoy a night experiencing the
unique Singaporean culture while
donating money to charity? Then
wait no longer! The Imperial College
Singapore Society proudly presents
Major Event 2013: Homecoming, the
annual event in the Imperial College
Singapore Society’s Calendar. This
year it comes in the form of a musical,
named “Homecoming”. It promises
to be a light-hearted show with good
fun and music as we take you through
the lives of 5 students, trying to make
their way back home. There will be
love, laughter and lots of singing and
dancing so be prepared for a wonder-
ful time! It will be a showcase of our
Singaporean culture, our quirks, our
quarks, and our very unique “Singlish”
will be liberally dispensed, so what are
you waiting for? Get your tickets at the
Singapore Society’s Union site or look
out for us at JCR from next week! All
proceeds will go to Save the Children,
UK. More details are available on
www.facebook.com/majorevent2013.
See you on the 2nd!
