FRIDAY 25 JANUARY
A timely reminder from the best
artist of the past twenty years
Back to work
week? We undertook a severe
investigation recently into other
things that share Imperial’s name.
Our results were particularly in-
triguing.
And then there’s some other
news or something.
Don’t forget that if, for some rea-
son, you’d rather hone your writing
skills with a review of your favour-
ite pastime rather than your latest
essay, Felix always needs content.
Feel free to email felix@imperial.
ac.uk with whatever you want.
Coffee Break Boss
So exams are out of the way for
most people, the snow’s melt-
ing (unless it’s snowing on Friday,
which would be hugely embar-
rassing) and there’s a whole term
of work ahead. Great stuff. It can
only be time to take a brief respite
from all of the action and chill with
a beverage of your choice.
Or, if you’re feeling particularly
extreme, enjoy this with a meal of
your choice. A baked potato per-
haps - a perennial favourite.
Anyway, what’s in store this
MEASUREMENT
CRISIS
HOPES FOR
LIBRARY SNOW-IN
DASHED
Fans of imperial measurements
were struck to the core this week
when it emerged that the name
of Imperial College Union’s ‘568’
was based on an approximation.
As nobody knows, the exact meas-
urement of a pint is 568.26125 ml.
Undoubtedly, ‘568’ and its connota-
tions with the sale of pints of alcohol
have been the source of unbridled
mirth and joy over the past couple
of years, but will that be the case
now the truth has been unveiled?
One particularly pedantic patron
sent an anonymous and heart-
felt message to Felix this week:
“This is the ultimate be-
trayal,” the note began.
“If I’m being honest, the only
way I’ll be tempted back into the
establishment is if they literally
rename it ‘568.26125’, but then
again it depends how desper-
ate I am for a pint of Strongbow.”
“To be honest, we should’ve
just called it ‘The Library’ like all
my mates wanted, at least there
was no room for confusion there.”
Diligent students seeking a new
reason not to leave Central Li-
brary were left crestfallen last
week when blizzard-like conditions
failed to block access to the infa-
mous two-door entrance system.
Chemist-in-training David Craig
spoke on the issue to Trash Talk:
“I was really excited when it start-
ed pummeling it down. It was like
Frank Bruno going at a giant sug-
ar cube in the sky or something.”
“When it turned out it wasn’t
heavy enough to block the way out,
I was really disappointed. I couldn’t
wait to spend the night in the li-
brary doing work, and on a Friday
too - it would’ve been unheard of!”
Craig, alongside countless other
keen beans, had to spend a sig-
nificant amount of potential work-
ing time travelling to their homes,
resulting in mass frustration.
Craig concluded: “we would’ve
been fine for food. If any-
one was hungry they could’ve
grabbed some baked beans
from the library café. Great food.”
What is the best kind of Imperial? Our vastly com-
prehensive feature will solve this age old question!
