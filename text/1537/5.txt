A meeting of the Ents Working Group,
chaired by Stefan Nubert, Deputy
President (Finance & Ser, is due to be
held on Friday 1 February at 12:30 –
1:30 pm. The group is set to convene
in order to consolidate a budget for
future events orchestrated by Ents,
including the prospective 2013 Sum-
mer Ball. All students are welcome
to attend and sit in session. A draft
budget is said to have been written
but is open to modiﬁcation (barring
meeting charges). Students attending
the session are invited to have an ac-
tive input and submit any suggestions
as appropriate. Budget ﬁnalisation will
take place over the coming month of
February. The current budget hopes to
give a bar tab of over £22,000.

not to have played a part in the deci-
sion.
The plans have met with wide-
spread opposition, with members of
the Unit creating a petition to pre-
vent its closure. Encouraging people
to sign the petition Dr Diaz-Cintas
emphasised that, “With a track re-
cord of 12 years of large-scale MSc
teaching and PhD provision, the
TSU has established itself as a strong
player within the College, with very
healthy recruitment, particularly of
overseas students, at both MSc and
PhD levels, and a strong provision
of further complementary activities”.
Arguing against any proposed move
of the unit he claimed out that with
its “strongly technical and scientiﬁc
proﬁle” the College was the “most
natural home” for a department spe-
cialising in technical translation.
The petition attracted over 2,500
supporters in its ﬁrst 48 hours and,
at the time of going to print, was
just over 260 signatures oﬀ meeting
its target of 5,000. Signatories have
praised the Units “unique contribu-
tion” to technical translation and
have called it a “fundamental point of
reference” of the ﬁeld.
It is unclear what would happen
to PhD students
in the middle
of their degrees
should the TSU close and these stu-
dents have been particularly vocal in
their concerns. Lindsay Bywood told
Felix of her disappointment at how
“PhD students and part-time MSc
students are being cast adrift by the
College in the middle of their cours-
es”, asserting that “an award of an Im-
perial degree is pretty meaningless
when I have no idea what sort of su-
pervision, library, and facilities sup-
port I will receive for the next three
years of my research”.
This is a view shared by Renata
Mliczak, who believes that “the plans
of the Management Board at IC are
truly inconsiderate of all the TSU
students”. She added that while it
was clear that “academics around the
world see the importance of the work
and research conducted by IC TSU
scholars, it is a big shame that IC
cannot see and appreciate
it”. She asserts that the
proposed closure acts
“as a message to the
world that IC is not
interested in dissemi-
nating (through trans-
lation) the great re-
search that is done here
in medicine, engineering
and natural sciences,
but doing it for its own sake” with
Soledad Zarate, another PhD stu-
dent, further questioning how “an in-
stitution of such high calibre, home
to students coming from all over
the world, [does] not recognise that
translation is vital for the transferral
of knowledge and research between
cultures worldwide”.
Concerns have also been raised
about how the closure might de-
value degrees that have already been
awarded, with Emmanouela Pati-
niotaki fearing that after the TSU’s
“closure or transferral the validity of
our degree in the translation indus-
try will be questioned”. Yuan Long
concurs, adding that with “current
gloomy picture of economy” employ-
ers might consider a qualiﬁcation
from a “Translation Unit at Imperial
which no longer exists” to have been
discredited.
In a statement given to Felix
the College’s communication
oﬃce said: “The consultation
follows a review by Imperial’s
Management Board, which
regularly evaluates the strate-
gic ﬁt of all parts of the Col-
lege. Following the review of the
TSU, Management Board agreed
that the Unit’s activities are
not core to Impe-
rial’s strategy.
“It also pro-
posed that the
possibility of the Unit becoming es-
tablished in an alternative academic
environment be explored, with a bet-
ter institutional ﬁt where the TSU
could form part of a larger and there-
fore more sustainable department.
… The Management Board agreed
that a priority would be to protect
the position of students currently
registered in the Unit. Regardless of
the outcome of the consultation, all
TSU students will be able to continue
to work towards an Imperial College
degree.”
Dr Diaz-Cintas, Head of the
Translation Unit is strongly
opposed to the closure
