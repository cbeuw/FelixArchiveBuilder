researcher at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) has,
through his self-devised
technique, managed
to successfully exercise control over
heat the same way we enjoy control
over light through mirrors and lenses
(most disappointingly falling short
of developing a giant heat ray, for
the time being). This new technique,
which utilises semiconducting alloy
crystal nanostructures and similar
materials, manipulates the physical
separation between atoms so that
they correspond to the wavelengths
of heat phonons.
To elucidate how heat and sound
phonons are diﬀerent, Martin Mal-
dovan, the researcher in question,
directs us to consider their associ-
ated frequencies: sound phonons are
on the order of kilohertz, while heat
phonons vibrate in the terahertz fre-
quencies. Sounds simple enough.
In developing this technique, the
initial step was to manipulate the heat
phonons’ operational frequency so it
would be reduced and similar to the
range of sound phonons, described
as “hypersonic heat”. For this to be
possible, germanium nanoparticles
of a particular range of sizes were in-
tegrated with silicon alloys, with the
resultant crystals having the desired
atomic separation needed for this hy-
personic heat. Furthermore, the fre-
quency range was narrowed through
the creation of thin ﬁlms on the edges
of the material, utilising optical prin-
ciples to ‘concentrate’ the frequencies
of the phonons. Not nearly as simple.
As a result, about 40% of the total
ﬂow of heat is not only streamlined to
a range of several hundred gigahertz
(considerably closer to kilohertz than
terahertz was!), but also focussed to
travel in one general direction, simi-
lar to the ﬂow of photons in lasers.
That is deﬁnitely no mean feat!
With this end-product, the heat
phonons can be controlled in a vari-
ety of ways using analogs of sound-
controlling phononic crystals that
have already been developed. Some
potential important applications
highlighted by Maldovan are the
improvement of thermoelectric de-
vices (which output electricity from
temperature gradients), and the de-
velopment of thermal ‘diodes’ which,
crucially, “could be useful in energy-
eﬃcient buildings in hot and cold cli-
mates” – now that’s deﬁnitely some-
thing I’d honestly appreciate and be
very grateful for.
Perhaps the fanciest application he
mentions is the creation of invisibility
cloaks for heat: for objects to become
perfectly undetectable by heat sen-
sors and the like. Honestly though, I
can only foresee how something like
that can be misused in the future
for non-peaceful purposes on inter-
national scales. Nonetheless, this is
merely the ﬁrst breakthrough of this
nature in heat-manipulating materi-
als; soon, we may well be channelling
the excess heat in the atmosphere
back out into space to counteract
global warming. Or building that gi-
ant heat ray, of course. Just in case
we get embroiled in The War of the
Worlds.

The Royal Institution in Mayfair
has been a centre for scientific re-
search and communication for over
two centuries. Previously the work-
place of such scientific greats as
Michael Faraday and George Por-
ter, the Ri now focuses on outreach,
running courses, book clubs, school
events, and the famous Christmas
Lectures, in their 18th cen-
tury building.
But an incredibly
badly timed £22m
refurbishment back
in 2008, combined
with years of mis-
management, has
left the charity in fi-
nancial turmoil. The true extent of
the crisis was unknown to the gen-
eral public until last week, when it
was reported in The Times that the
charity had secretly put the May-
fair site on the market for upwards
of £60, in an attempt to recoup its
mounting debts.
The Institution has insisted that
the selling of the building is just one
of many options being considered,
but nevertheless outrage and dis-
may have been expressed by some
members of the scientific com-
munity and the general public.
Twitter campaigns have sprung
up to ‘save the Ri’, whilst physi-
cist Jim Al-Khalili has com-
mented that ‘it seems crazy
that at a time when science and
science communication is riding
a wave of popularity not seen for
generations, we hear that the very
epitome of a British scien-
tific institution is under
threat.’

researchers at MIT do...
