The Overseas society presen
Next week marks the university’s sec-
ond International Week of the year
(4th – 9th Feburary) with overseas
societies coming together to promote
cultural diversity and integration at
Imperial College. The celebrations
build up to Saturday 9th Feburary
where the 11th annual International
Night will take place. With perfor-
mances varying from traditional
dances to traditional plays adapted
to original modern day themes; this
promise to be a hugely entertaining
evening.
Here we answer some questions and
hear from the societies taking part
and their plans to overload your sens-
es with a cultural explosion that will
leave you oozing happiness and truly
in awe of the wealth of culture around
day in day out at Imperial College.
What is I Night?
I-Night is a colourful variety show that
has been running for over a decade.
Originally a haven for international
students to express their various tra-
ditions, it has grown into a major
event in Imperial’s calendar and is the
largest of its kind at the College. The
event takes place in the Great Hall of
Imperial College (9 February) and has
proved to be a successful channel for
the cultural vibrancy within the Col-
lege time and time again. Favourite
performances are the Japanese so-
ciety’s ‘anime-style’ pantomime and
Cypriot society’s cultural dance and
comedic sketches. Unsurprisingly, the
laughter and harmonious atmosphere
produced by I Night has invited par-
ticipating groups beyond the overseas
societies including Funkology, Belly
Dancing society and Wushu to get in-
volved in the celebrations.
I Night is a tradition between all
participating societies and spurs a
friendly air of competition encourag-
ing everyone to give their all. As a re-
sult, the energy given oﬀ by the night
attracts over 500 students each year
to attend the event. We are proud to
unite all of the students of Imperial
together and donate the proceeds to
our chosen charity. – Wasim Khouri
OSC Chair
We now hear from IC Belly Danc-
ing, Cypriot society, Hellenic society,
Japanese society and IC Funkology
about what they have in store for us
on the night as well as words from
the Co-Chairs of this great event.
IC Belly Dancing
The IC Belly Dancing society would
like to present to you a medley of
choreographs ranging from classical
belly dance to a more modern twist.
Dance is our way of expressing the old
oriental culture and this year’s chore-
ographies are an expansion upon last
year’s repertoire at I Night: we aim to
impress the audience with the shear
variety that belly dancing has to of-
fer and can’t wait to see you there!! –
Lydia Lilis
Hellenic Society
The Hellenic Society brings to you
an amazing spectacle right from the
heart of Greek culture. From battle
representations and victory celebra-
tions to medieval sword ﬁghting, the
Greek folklore dances can be char-
acterized as living history that has
come as heritage to us through the
ages.
The Greek dances contain our his-
tory. Taught from one person to an-
other, it cannot be captured in books
or mastered through studying. With
each person dancing each dance, the
unbreakable chain of teachers and
students expands in time to link all
those who have danced and have car-
ried it with them over the centuries.
These dances bear tales of strength
and bravery but also of love and pain.
We will embody these dances and
bring the tales back to life for I Night
– Michael Dinalexis
Funkology Society
FuNkoLoGy began in 2003 as a simple
outlet for a group of students at Impe-
rial College to train and develop their
passion for urban dance and push the
boundaries of hip-hop dance perfor-
mance across the UK university com-
munity. At I Night we are putting on
our best performance to date!
The night is a fusion of talents, di-
versity and passion, and this is what
I love about it. The excitement of the
competition for ‘best performance’ of
the evening just adds to the special
occasion and means that the atmos-
phere on the night is truly electric! –
Eva Yuan
Japanese Society
As is tradition, this year the Japanese
society is going to perform a play at
I Night. The play is modern take on
Japanese culture and the interaction
with our world.
With the play we want to promote
our culture, but mostly, we want to
make people laugh.
The actors in the play are all well
known characters that represent
Japan and perform through mime
whilst all sounds are by narration and
sound eﬀect.
