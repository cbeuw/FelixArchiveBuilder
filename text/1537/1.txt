The Imperial College Management
Board has announced the proposed
closure of the College’s Translation
Studies Unit (TSU). Founded in 2001
to provide teaching for the College’s
new MSc in Scientiﬁc, Technical and
Medical Translation, the only such
degree in the country, it now oversees
the studies of over a hundred Masters
and Doctorate students. A period of
consultation regarding the fate of the
Unit began last Friday and is set to run
until February 18. All applications to
courses run by the unit have been sus-
pended and while the College say that
they hopes the Unit will be able to
ﬁnd a home at a diﬀerent institution
it admits that, if this should prove not
to be possible, it might be closed per-
manently.
Staﬀ found out about the plans at
a meeting on Friday 18 January. In a
subsequent email to members of the
Unit Dr Jorge Diaz-Cintas told col-
leagues that the primary reason for
the proposals is that the Board does
not consider “the activities carried
out by the TSU are not considered
core to the College strategy”. The Unit
remains proﬁtable and ﬁnancial con-
siderations are understood not
