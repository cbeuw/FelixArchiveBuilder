FRIDAY 25 JANUARY
ites for the Oscars
Alan Arkin
Argo
Previous winner? Yes
Little Miss Sunshine (2006)
Previous nominee? Yes
The Russians Are Coming! The
Russians Are Coming (1966)
The Heart is a Lonely Hunter
(1968)
Why he will win:
He is almost single-handedly
responsible for the comedy
aspect in Ben Affleck’s thrilling
new critically acclaimed
film. As a snarky Hollywood
producer who declares that
if he’s making a fake movie,
it will be a fake hit, he is an
absolute pro in delivering his
dry, sarcastic one-liners, giving
the film a lot of breathing
room.
Why he won’t win:
He has not been winning any
major awards for this role, just
a list of respectable noms.
Robert De Niro
Silver Linings Playbook
Previous winner? Yes
The Godfather: Part II (1974)
Raging Bull (1980)
Previous nominee? Yes
Taxi Driver (1976)
The Deer Hunter (1978)
Awakenings (1990)
Cape Fear (1991)
Why he will win:
De Niro has been starring in
some terrible films of late,
but here is a role that is finally
worthy of his name and talent.
Why he won’t win:
Again, he hasn’t been winning
many awards for this, and
this Oscar nomination was a
nice surprise, but a surprise
nonetheless. And he’s a
two-time winner already.
Remember how long it took
Meryl Streep to score her third
Oscar? De Niro might have to
wait a few more years.
Philip Seymour Hoffman
The Master
Previous winner? Yes
Capote (2005)
Previous nominee? Yes
Charlie Wilson’s War (2007)
Doubt (2008)
Why he will win:
The Master was a big hit at the
2011 Venice Film Festival, with
both Hoffman and Joaquin
Phoenix jointly winning the
Best Actor Award – both
deservingly so. In contrast to
Phoenix’s more intense, showy
role, Hoffman here puts on a
very much humble, intelligent
performance, with plenty
of charisma, too, perfectly
plausible as a man leading
a dodgy cult with complex
philosophical ideas.
Why he won’t win:
The Master had fantastic buzz
– back in September. But now,
not so much, next to nothing.
Tommy Lee Jones
Lincoln
Previous winner? Yes
The Fugitive (1993)
Previous nominee? Yes
JFK (1991)
In the Valley of Elah (2007)
Why he will win:
With an immensely fun role
in which he screams and
shouts racial equality and
stands out amongst a crowd
of conservatives, Jones is a key
supporting player that makes
Lincoln work to its fullest
potential. He has a number of
rousing speeches to make, and
is effective in delivering them.
Why he won’t win:
SnubbedbytheCritics’Choice,
he didn’t pick up the gong at
the Globes either. This is one
heck of a competitive field
this year, and a general lack of
support so far is not looking
good for the actor.
Christoph Waltz
Django Unchained
Previous winner? Yes
Inglourious Basterds (2009)
Previous nominee? No
Why he will win:
He has a knack for playing
hysterical anti-heroes and
snarky villains. He also seems
to have been designed to
star in many, many Quentin
Tarantino productions, as
he competently rolls off the
lengthy lines of dialogue the
eccentric director gives him.
He has a meaty role here, and
has won a Golden Globe so far.
Why he won’t win:
Is he a bit of a one-trick pony?
Perhaps. He plays very simliar
types (although incredibly
well) in a lot of his films (which
could also explain why he
makes such a good match with
Tarantino) – and maybe the
voters will pick up on that.
