CLUBS & SOCIETIES
felix@imperial.ac.uk
FRIDAY 25 JANUARY 15
This year
the play will be
about a Japanese samurai win-
ning a competition to date the Hime
(princess of his country). The
shows involve characters like
Otaku (young people who are
highly skilled in, or obsessed with,
computer technology to the detri-
ment of their social skills), Kendo
master and Chadou (tea club).
I am so happy that we have the
chance to perform at I Night and take
part in the celebration of diversity at
Imperial. – Da Chen
Cypriot Society
Live music with the sound of the
inspiring violin and acoustic guitar,
accompanied with the marvelous
voices of singers, traditional cos-
tumes, traditional food and drinks
and some tremendous folklore dance
are what make Inight so enjoyable
for me. Our performance this year is
set in a coﬀee shop in Cyprus at the
start of the 20th century and aims to
reﬂect the customs and culture of
Cyprus at that time.
The programme in-
cludes songs and traditional dances.
Fast paced, improvisational, and
stunt dances are all included. The
additional surprise this year is the
dance of Kouza, which is performed
by women holding pottery vases with
a surprise love story also included in
the dance, part of the tradition!! Cyp-
riot delicacies will be served during
the performance including the fa-
mous halloumi, shiromeri and the
exceptional drink of zivania!! – Renos

I am so impressed by the tradition-
al and spectacular character of inight
and its ability to probe to the roots
of 10 diﬀerent cultures in one night.
Not only does it enable around 200
Imperial students to unravel their
talent on stage in front of a large au-
dience, but
it mutually
teaches to students the cultural va-
riety of the world: A world, which
belongs to us, the future generations.
This year’s I-Night titled ‘One world’
captivates my interest not only to
give my best self on stage but to also
have an amazing time by being edu-
cated simultaneously. I can’t wait!!” –

For the past two years I have been
part of the Cypriot society act,
performing the dance of Tatsia,
a cypriot traditional dance per-
formed by a single dancer per-
forming stunts with a traditional
sieve and a glass full of alcohol in
order to impress the woman he
loves. I cannot even describe how
thrilled and excited I was while
on stage, promoting my culture
to 300 people from different so-
cieties and different backgrounds.
The excitement was even big-
ger when Cypriot society won! I
Night, is a big part of my studies
at Imperial, that is why I decided
to be the Co-Chair of this year’s I
Night,
I promise you is going to be the
biggest and most beautiful event
you have ever seen!

I never thought I would have the
opportunity to get involved in
organising a show such as I Night.
Last year, I became strongly mo-
tivated after winning the event
with the Cypriot society. As a
dancer, I truly enjoyed the show
and joined in the crowd’s excite-
ment of experiencing a truly inter-
national atmosphere at The Great
Hall. Participating at I Night was
a life-time experience for us and
it was great to see our friends and
fellow students supporting us.
Everybody was so thrilled in the
audience that they were actually
vividly shouting for their favourite
societies and waiving their na-
tional flags!
I felt so proud at this moment
and had to be involved in the
event this year to deliver the most
exciting and impressive Interna-
tional Night ever at Imperial!!
