Academic uprising: 5% more professors
On 17 January, the Higher Education
Statistics Agency (HESA) released the
ﬁrst set of data from the 2011/12 Staﬀ
record. This data provides informa-
tion about staﬀ employment at UK
Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)
on 1 December 2011. The results have
been produced in partnership with
the UK administrations and have been
released upon approval by the UK Sta-
tistics Authority. A detailed analysis of
the HESA Staﬀ record will be released
in March 2013. Felix did a brief analy-
sis of the results, so you don’t have to...
All Staff
The data shows that on 1 Decem-
ber 2011, there were 378,250 staﬀ
employed in the HE sector, demon-
strating a decrease of 0.9% from the
371,790 staﬀ employed on 1 Decem-
ber 2010. The all staﬀ count excludes
atypical staﬀ. 181,385 (48.0%) were
academic professionals compared to
181,185 (47.5%) in 2010. In 2011 the
percentages of female staﬀ remained
constant from last year, with 46.9% of
full-time staﬀ and 67.0% of part-time
staﬀ. However, there was an increase
in the number of females with mana-
gerial positions, with 8,740 in 2011
and 8,770 in 2010. In addition, there
was a decrease in the number of fe-
males employed as laboratory, engi-
neering, building and IT technicians.
Academic Staff
Despite the overall decrease in higher
education staﬀ, there was actually a
0.5% increase in academic staﬀ, with
200 more than the previous year.
There was an increase in female aca-
demic staﬀ from the previous year;
with 80,775 (44.5%) female academic
staﬀ in 2011 compared to 80,090
(44.2%) in 2010. There was a 5.7% in-
crease in the number of academic staﬀ
employed as professors, with 18,465
in 2011 and 17,465 in 2010. The most
notable change was the 9.7% increase
in female professors, there were 3,790
in 2011 and only 3,455 in 2010. Con-
sequently, the proportion of women
who are now professors is 20.5%. This
increase seen by female professors is
more than double the rise seen by the
previous year (2010-2011 from 2009-
2010) at 4.1%.

2008-2009, there has been a 5.3% in-
crease in professors, with 930 more
professors now employed in UK
higher education institutions. Addi-
tionally, there has been a 16% rise in
the number of female professors from
2008-2009, with their currently being
520 more employed in UK higher edu-
cation.
Taking a look at the academic staﬀ
responsibilities, it can be seen the
largest increase was for employment
in solely teaching roles, this sector
showed an increase of 820 employees
to 45,825. There was also an increase
in research staﬀ and those employed
for both teaching as well as research.
BBC News reported that the “gen-
eral secretary of the University and
College Union, Sally Hunt, welcomed
the increase in female professors but
said there was more to be done”. She
said she is “pleased that there has been
a rise in the number of female profes-
sors in the sector. However, universi-
ties still have more to do to ensure that
staﬀ are promoted on merit irrespec-
tive of their background or gender.
Students want to be taught by the best
and brightest, and staﬀ want to work
in universities where gender is not
an issue when it comes to career ad-
vancement.”
The number of Non-EU postgradu-
ate applicants has fallen for the ﬁrst
time in 16 years. In previous years
the numbers had risen annually by an
average of more than 10%. Figures re-
leased by the Higher Education Statis-
tical Agency (Hesa) shows a 1% drop
fuelling ideas that the government’s
immigration crackdown is deterring
students continuing their education in
the UK.
The drop, from 174,225 to 173,560,
was the ﬁrst fall since such Hesa data
began in 1995. The total number of
university applicants for 2012 has de-
creased by 7.4% compared to the pre-
vious year along with a decrease in the
number of EU applicants by 11.2%.
Jo Beall, British Council Director of
Education and Society, said “the sector
was expecting a decline in growth, but
the actual reduction in postgraduate
numbers is of real concern as inter-
national students make up the major-
ity of numbers in many postgraduate
courses and research teams in science,
technology engineering and math-
ematics.
“Attracting the brightest and most
ambitious postgraduate and research
students is critical if the UK is to
maintain its quality reputation for re-
search and innovation,” Beall said.
The government aims to cut down
net migration to the “tens of thou-
sands” by 2015 and there are fears that
this will aﬀect international students
that want to study in the UK. Mark
Harper, the Immigration Minister, de-
nied calls from universities to remove
overseas students from the net mi-
grant count. He said there is no “logi-
cal reason” to make the change.
Universities UK has told the govern-
ment that they should remove inter-
national students who are sponsored
by universities from the net migration
count so that these universities are
spared from the government’s plans.
However, when asked if he could
envisage a situation where the gov-
ernment could make this change, Mr
Harper issued a “no”.
He added: “The international deﬁni-
tion that’s used is that if you change
your country of residence for more
than a year, you are a migrant. Frankly,
if we weren’t going to count students,
it’s not obvious why we wouldn’t count
lots of other people.”
Yes, [the students are] paying fees to
come here, but in the same way some-
one coming here to work for a private
sector employer is contributing to that
company’s economic success. I don’t
see any logical reason why we would
treat them [overseas students] diﬀer-
ently”.
Even though there has been a con-
tinual increase in the number of stu-
dents coming to the UK from China,
there has been a drop in the number of
students applying from both India and
Pakistan by 25% and 13% respectively.
Beall said: “These statistics for the
ﬁrst time provide real evidence that
the changes to UK visa regulations
may have dissuaded many students
from applying to the UK, and in par-
ticular postgraduate students who are
so important to the UK’s research out-
put. The UK enjoys an excellent repu-
tation around the world for the high
quality of our education system, so
the government needs to ensure that
institutions have all the support they
need to attract international students
who make a tremendous academic,
cultural and economic contribution to
the UK.”
