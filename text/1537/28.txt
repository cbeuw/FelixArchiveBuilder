FRIDAY 25 JANUARY 29
Science and art rarely seem to collabo-
rate in popular culture (and we are not
talking about science ﬁction here). It is
a shame, because science is inherently
intriguing without requiring the em-
bellishment of artistic and creative in-
put. So, when they are combined, they
are a strong force of entertainment.
The Eﬀect is a play that brings to-
gether Connie and Tristan (Billie Pip-
er and Jonjo O’Neill) during a trial to
understand the eﬀects of a new dopa-
mine-based treatment for depression
on healthy adults. They are under the
supervision of Dr James (Anastasia
Hille) who is battling against a de-
pression, triggered by the immorality
of both her present situation and her
past history with ex-partner, Toby
(Tom Goodman-Hill. This is the man
who has developed the drugs that are
being used in the trial that she is over-
seeing.
The strong cast was well suited to
the staging at the intimate Cottlesloe
Theatre, the audience entirely sur-
rounding the action and looking down
upon the actors, who had no room for
errors. In any case, they did not com-
mit any. Even Tristan’s tap dance in an
eﬀort to woo Connie was perfect.
What was more impressive, though,
was how thought-provoking the play
was. As the participants begin falling
for each other, Connie begins to ques-
tion the love she feels for Tristan. Dr
James begins to question the ability
of the drug, and both begin to ques-
tion the signiﬁcance of the increased
levels of dopamine in the participants’
systems.
Speculation is rife: which is the
cause and which is the eﬀect? For
Connie, does it even matter?
When Tristan ends up with tran-
sient global amnesia, he is no longer
the same man Connie fell for, and, al-
though she still loves him, she begins
to question what the basis of a human
identity is.
Although this was a slightly obvious
tack to take, the writing (Lucy Preb-
ble) was easily the highlight of this
play, even more than so than the high
quality acting and directing (Rupert
Goold).
Especially intriguing was the char-
acter of Dr James. Her kind and genu-
inely caring and open
nature towards
Tristan and Con-
nie, doing eve-
rything she
could to re-
assure them
as well as
taking re-
sponsibility
for Tristan’s
amnesia, made
her very easy to
sympathise with.
After building up such a strongly
positive opinion of her, digesting her
controversial opinions on the delicate
topic that is depression was particu-
larly entertaining.
To her, depression is not a disease.
Mildly depressed people have a more
realistic view of the world, and are
only aﬀected because they are freed
of the delusions which keep healthy
individuals happy. Drugs cannot treat
depression because the underlying
“chemical imbalance” causing it has
not been elucidated. The general pub-
lic is not suﬃciently educated on what
little understanding has been gleaned
from research. Drug companies ex-
ploit the relative ignorance of suﬀer-
ers by oﬀering drugs which inevitably
cannot treat their depression. The idea
of administering drugs for depression
is as ridiculous to Dr James as the no-
tion of the four humours.
It was controversial because these
were the opinions of a “professional”,
which led to the audience ponder-
ing over how relevant they are to the
thoughts of actual professionals on
the same topic.
It is interesting to note that such an
opinion, and many other aspects of the
play are a freeze frame on the current
attitudes, social and medical, towards
depression. More than most contem-
porary plays, The Eﬀect highlights a
topic of great signiﬁcance to our so-
ciety today. By exploring depression,
Prebble explores its reﬂection of soci-
ety. Whereas in a lot of contemporary
writing the present is conveyed via the
past, or modern societal values are
explored in very obvious ways, Preb-
ble’s The Eﬀect is deﬁnitely something
unique.
It was disappointing that the love
aspect of the storyline did not seem
to be as carefully considered. It was
only a matter of days before the lead
characters “fell in love”, which seemed
a little too Hollywood. Although I had
no qualms with the idea that such
characters felt strong infatuation,
their process of falling in love was in-
credibly unbelievable and annoyingly
unoriginal.
Furthermore, if Connie is a student
who lives in a “shit hole”, how does she
have the capacity to bring home and
support another adult with amnesia
due to last an indeﬁnite amount of
time?
Aside from the few
blips, if anything (for
science students es-
pecially) it is deﬁ-
nitely worth going
along for the “psy-
chology is not a
real science” jokes.
The Effect is on at the Na-
tional Theatre. Tickets from
£12. Until 23rd February.
