FRIDAY 25 JANUARY
38
Felix Film favouri
Sally Field
Lincoln
Previous winner? Yes
Norma Rae (1979)
Places in the Heart (1984)
Previous nominee? No
Why she will win:
It’s one heck of a performance
from one of the most
accomplished, long-standing
actresses working today.
Known for her undying energy
and knack for heavy, dense
drama, it’s surprising to think
thatFieldwasn’tinfacttheﬁrst
choice when it came to casting
the role. But after excessive
begging and numerous
successful auditions, she
ﬁnally got the role, and is quite
simply unforgettable in it.
Why she won’t win:
Anne Hathaway. Even a two-
time Oscar winning veteran
actress won’t be able to beat
the dream Hathaway dreamed.
Anne Hathaway
Les Misérables
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? Yes
Rachel Getting Married (2008)
Why she will win:
During the 2009 Academy
Award ceremony, Shirley
MacLaine remarked that
Hathaway will be in store
for more nominations in the
future, and that she had a
wonderful singing voice. Four
years later, Hathaway ﬁnds
herself once again up for an
Oscar, in a singing role. Her
heart-wrenching performance
as Fantine singing ‘I Dreamed
a Dream’ blew everyone away
and has been winning various
other awards left and right.
Why she won’t win:
Very little chance of an upset
here – she better get her
acceptance speech ready and
polished.
Helen Hunt
The Sessions
Previous winner? Yes
As Good As It Gets (1997)
Previous nominee? No
Why she will win:
Shebaredall,whichisnotabad
start when you’re trying to get
recognised during the awards
season, but her performance
is a sensitive, compassionate
and brave one, as a sex
surrogate gently probing her
way around a man conﬁned
to an iron lung as he works to
lose his virginity. Balancing
both the funny and serious
natures of her character,
Hunt, who has been away
from the screen for a while,
gives a surprisingly restrained,
humble performance.
Why she won’t win:
AnneHathaway.Andunluckily
for Hunt, the ﬁlm itself has
very little support.
Jacki Weaver
Silver Linings Playbook
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? Yes
Animal Kingdom (2010)
Why she will win:
This Australian talent came
to everyone’s attention
portraying the terrifying
matriarch of a Melbourne-
based crime family. Here she
has a complete reversal: she’s
now a nervously-spoken,
kind-hearted, and concerned
mother and wife, having
to deal with mental health
conditions and the difficult
males in her family.
Why she won’t win:
Anne Hathaway. Also, the
5th Best Supporting Actress
category was a toss-up
between Weaver and many
other actresses, and her slot
here is considered the last,
weakest addition to the list.
Amy Adams
The Master
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? Yes
Junebug (2005)
Doubt (2008)
The Fighter (2010)
Why she will win:
Ever since she became a critics’
favourite with Junebug, the
actress who seemed only to
be suited for the sweet and
adorable type has been forever
expanding her range and with
The Master comes the most
radical change away from
her usual comfort zone, and
it’s a convincing one, as she
plays the steely-eyed, quietly
determined and ambitious
wife of a cult/religious leader
Why she won’t win:
Anne Hathaway. Plus Adam’s
role here isn’t signiﬁcant
enough to warrant signiﬁcant
wins.
