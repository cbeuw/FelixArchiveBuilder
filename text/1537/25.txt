ooking. Some of you
might hate it. Maybe it
is time you started see-
ing cooking and food a
bit diﬀerently? I believe
food is not just something you need to
survive. It is much more than that as
it creates memories and brings people
together!
Remember the smell of your favour-
ite food your mum used to make for
you when you were a kid? Or how ex-
cited you were about your huge birth-
day cake? Or the cookies you used to
eat at your friend’s house? Ask your
mum for the recipe of that special
food that was your favourite, make it
and you will feel like being at home.
That’s why food is important. It is
probably the only thing that can bring
memories back!
And of course, food is more en-
joyable when it is shared with other
people. So when you cook invite your
friends too. Is there a better gift you
can give to your friends than cook-
ing for them (except maybe some nice
French liqueur…)? I don’t think so.
Cooking requires eﬀort and that’s why
I appreciate people who would cook
It really is simple, cheap and abso-
lutely divine. It will take you about 10
minutes to make and it only needs 15
minutes in the oven. So, in less than
30 minutes and with minimum eﬀort
you can also have this amazing des-
sert.
You will need 6 ramekins.
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all purpose ﬂour
1/3 cup good quality cocoa
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup sunﬂower oil
1 cup (preferably almond) milk
Seeds of 1 vanilla pod
2 tbsp vinegar
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup chocolate chips
6 ramekins
Procedure:
Preheat your oven at 180 degrees.
Place parchment paper in 6 ramekins
and lightly grease them.
In a bowl mix the almond milk, the
oil, the vinegar and the vanilla seeds.
Set aside and leave for about 15 min-
utes or until it curdles.
In a separate bowl sift the ﬂour, cocoa
and soda. Add the sugar and mix well.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry
mixture and mix until just combined.
Be very careful not to overmix as this
will develop the gluten in the ﬂour and
your cakes will not be light and ﬂuﬀy.
Fill 1/3 of the ramekins with the mix-
ture and then add a tbsp of chocholate
chips in each one of them. Then put the
rest of the mixture on top so that the
ramekins are 2/3 full.
Bake for about 12-15 minutes. Once
baked, remove from the oven and serve
the lava cakes hot. They are great with
hazelnut ice-cream! Enjoy!
for others.
All of the above are the reasons I
was very excited when I received this
recipe from Amy Lam, a second year
chemical engineering student. She
made this amazing cheesecake as a
surprise for the birthday of her friend.
How great is that? She devoted the
time to make it and the results show
that all the care and eﬀort she put into
it paid oﬀ. Needless to say that her
friends were more than thrilled.
So, this is the recipe. Try it and make
something your friends will always re-
member. And if it is not their birthday,
just ﬁnd another reason to celebrate!

gestive biscuits, and mix it with 50g of

cept the blueberries and dark chocolate

slightly wobbly in the centre. Leave in
the tin to cool and put in the fridge. Cut
the chocolate into small shavings and
