Divine Chocolate
Or otherwise known as that really nice
chocolate in the Library café for days
when a bar of Dairy Milk just can’t cut
it.
The Divine chocolate shop gives
coaco farmers a fair-trade price and
45% ownership of the company. It was
founded as a partnership between the
Kuapa Kokoo cocoa growers’ collec-
tive and the alternative trading organ-
ization Twin Trading. It means that
the Kuapa Kokoo cocoa growers have
a say about how the company is run
resulting in fair working conditions
and an authentic respect of local tra-
ditions. It also sells yummy chocolate
of course.

What’s the link between Jamie Oliver,
Hint: It’s not nakedness. (Though that could work too... sort of...)
he term “social enter-
prise” was ﬁrst coined
during the late 70s. The
idea is simple. A social
enterprise is a business
where social aims come ﬁrst, and
proﬁt comes second. Yes, you read
that right – social aim ﬁrst, proﬁt sec-
ond. Social entrepreneurs are busi-
ness minded people who are a little
bit warm and fuzzy around the edge.
Think Alan Sugar meets Mother The-
resa, or Donald Trump meets Flor-
ence Nightingale. It’s all about busi-
ness acumen being applied to doing
good.
Social enterprises have been pop-
ping up all over the place since the
start of the new millennium. They
are a growing trend that’s showing no
sign of slowing, and for good reason.
Since social enterprises generate their
own income, and don’t rely on grants
or donations (like charities do), they
are often hailed as a more sustainable
mechanism for social change. This
means that when times get tough (hel-
lo ‘ﬁnancial crisis’) and charities suﬀer
from lowered levels of funding, a so-
cial enterprise can retain the ability to
keep on solving social issues.
There a loads of social enterprises
around. You probably think of many as
just normal businesses rather than so-
cial projects. Take Jamie Oliver’s res-
taurant Fifteen, for example. Here, un-
employed young people are trained as
chefs and are thereby given the chance
to have a better future. Another good
example is The Big Issue, where home-
less people are given the opportunity
to take some control of their lives and
to re-join mainstream society by sell-
ing a magazine.
There are so many diﬀerent kinds
of social enterprises, set up by diﬀer-
ent people for diﬀerent reasons. Teach
First, Divine Chocolate and The Good
Gym are three diﬀerent examples.

Teach First
Everyone has heard of TeachFirst. They
have an innovative business model
where they entice bright graduates to
tackle educational disadvantage by
teaching in schools for two years or
more. Once they have completed the
scheme, graduates choose whether to
continue teaching, assume positions
within government or industry or even
work on their own social enterprises.
It was set up by an ex McKinsey em-
ployee. Brett Wigdortz took a planned
six-month leave of absence from Mc-
Kinsey to develop a business plan for
Teach First. He had no experience of
either public policy or teaching when
he started and had never managed
anyone. Teach First is a great example
of how anyone with a great idea, some
basic business knowledge and true
dedication can make a real positive dif-
ference.
The Good Gym
A lesser-known social enterprise is the
GoodGym. Operating in East London,
they take exercise out of the gym and
make it useful. In their words “gyms
purposefully waste energy. There are
many neglected tasks, and people in
our communities that need that en-
ergy.” For example, in order to tackle
loneliness amongst older people,
GoodGym members adopt an elderly
person as their coach and run to their
house to deliver a newspaper, or some
fruit. Pretty neat, huh?
It was set up by Ivo Gormley, a
Clore Social Leadership fellow and
documentary ﬁlm-maker and seems
as though it’s growing in popularity
across the big smoke.
Your turn?
So as you can see, there are loads of
great social enterprises around. But
what about student-run social enter-
prises? There are a few initiatives run
by students, E.quinox is a brilliant
example of a student led social enter-
prise at Imperial. However, shouldn’t
there be more? After all universities
are full of bright, creative people
wanting to involve themselves in in-
teresting extra curricular projects.
Social enterprises should be bursting
out of the seems of our campuses. So
why aren’t they?
Last Friday Imperial Hub met up
with Year Here (another Social Enter-
prise challenging gap year students to
spend a “year here” in the UK tack-
ling social issues in their own back-
yard) to consider this exact question.
One interesting point raised was
around failure. University teaches us
to fear failure. As students, we are
constantly trying to avoid failing our
exams, lab reports and/or projects.
However, in real life, and especially in
the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship, failure
is essential to learning, reﬁning and
then improving.
Failure is conducive to good ideas
and the term “fail fast” is a rapidly
spreading piece of wisdom for bud-
ding entrepreneurs. We talked about
how opening up a space where failing
is OK, and even encouraged, could
help students be more experimen-
tal, adventurous and ultimately more
creative in their social entrepreneur-
ship initiatives.
Another challenge discussed was
Did anyone else used to think
that The Naked Chef was
about Jamie cooking naked?
