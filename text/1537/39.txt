n terms of iOS, 2012 was the
year of the iPhone 5. After a
rather disappointing iPhone
4S, the anticipation had been
growing under the surface for
a long time. When the iPhone 5 was
revealed on the 12th of September
of last year, it sported a radical new
design, a better graphics processor,
new A6 chip as well as LTE technol-
ogy and ﬁnally Felix Tech has one to
review.
Before diving into the heart of the ar-
ticle, I would like to ﬁrst give a nega-
tive point, not to the iPhone 5 but
actually iOS 5 instead. Yes, I know
that was almost 2 years ago, but I feel
I have to get this oﬀ my chest. A fea-
ture which was not widely announced
when it was revealed, was the fact
that you need a sim card to activate
your phone. While not actually det-
rimental, it was annoying to say the
least. Perhaps it is understandable,
because in eﬀect a phone cannot be
used without a SIM card, however I
thought the iPhone was supposed to
be so much more than a phone. Nev-
ertheless, after a trip to the Apple
store to get myself a nano sim (which
was less stressful than I thought), I
had a perfect working model of the
latest version of the iPhone.
The actual design of the new phone
is quite, for lack of a better word,
beautiful. Thinner than the iPhone
4S, it looks like the luxury item it is
supposed to be. The black version has
a grey bezel on the back which makes
it elegant, and I personally feel that
the move from steel, that was used
in the previous two iPhone models,
to an aluminium composite makes
this phone feel more like a piece of
art than a utility tool. This change is
exempliﬁed by the sides of the phone,
which are composed of a grey matte
area as well as two bands of highly
buﬀed material, which could almost
act like mirrors. Apple has also man-
aged to make the iPhone signiﬁcantly
thinner as well as lighter than its pre-
decessors, which comes with a bit of
surprise, as not only is the iPhone 5
larger it also includes the LTE tech.
The screen of the iPhone 5 is, to say
the least, amazing. Even better than
the 4S, which was purported to be the
best screen on the market, it is razor
sharp and the colours are vibrant.
Also in line with the general smart-
phone competition, the iPhone 5 has
a larger screen now. Even though this
is the ﬁrst iPhone with a 4” screen, it
just felt right. In comparison previous
iPhones seem short and ill-ﬁtting.
Apps which are optimised to uti-
lise the whole area of the screen, are
beautiful to behold and really do use
all those extra pixels. Even apps that
are built for the smaller screen size do
not suﬀer any disadvantage, as black
bars are added to the top and bottom
of the iPhone 5 screen. In fact, due to
this phone being black I did not even
notice unless I really concentrated on
it (although probably on the white
one it would be more noticeable).
In terms of processing power and
actual speed the iPhone 5 kicks ass.
Faster than any previous iteration of
iPhone, I also pitted it against a Nokia
Lumia 920. Although the Lumia was
slightly more reactive with certain
actions, in most of tests I did, the iP-
hone held its own. The new A6 chip
really does feel miles better than the
A5, and A5X and in the future I will
be attempting to max it out as much
as possible. The graphics processor
is also amazing, and when playing
FIFA 13, not only did it play and ﬂow
extremely nicely, the graphics per-
formed admirably.
Cameras and photos are a big part
of what makes a smart phone, as the
digital camera slowly fades into ob-
scurity. The iPhone 5 has the same
8MP camera as the 4S in the back,
and now has a upgraded 1.2 MP front
camera. The back camera was quite
good in all lights, being sharp and fo-
cused. Also the rather rapid capture

I
rate impressed me, as the picture was
taken almost instantaneously. In ad-
dition to that, the new panorama fea-
ture is quite impressive, it’s easy to use
with great panorama pictures coming
out as a result. The only thing that
annoys me is the digital zoom. Apple
declared this was such a good camera,
and yet when you want to zoom onto
something everything turns blurry.
Something that could maybe be im-
proved on with iPhone 5S/6.
The operating system of the iPhone
5 (iOS 6) is Apple’s latest software.
Whilst not without some “scandal”,
it is a good OS nonetheless. You have
probably heard all about the horrible
mapping app, so I won’t bore you with
it. However keep in mind not only
have Nokia released Here Maps, but
there is now a Google Maps app in
the app store which works really well.
Pros of iOS include iMessage, the
great app store and iCloud services.
However the most beneﬁcial part
apart about the software is that Apple
makes both it and its corresponding
hardware. This means that the full ca-
pabilities of the phone can be utilised.
Thus the OS is fast, responsive and a
pleasure to use.
Other signiﬁcant features on the
iPhone 5 are the new Lightning con-
nector and usage of the nano sim
card. Firstly the Lightning connec-
tor. Released to mixed reviews, it has
been one of the big talking points of
iPhone 5. It is much smaller than the
previous connector, which allowed
Apple to ﬁt more into the new iPhone
and still keep it thin and light. Yet it
also renders any previous accessory
useless. Admittedly for me it was not
much of a deterrent as I do not have
that many accessories, however I can
imagine for someone who did splash
out on the stereo system, car plugs
etc. that this would be quite annoying.
Apple’s handling of this new technol-
ogy was unwise to say the least, as
many people who would have bought
the iPhone 5, hesitated. Perhaps
they should have included convert-
ers for iPhone buyers. However they
wouldn’t make that much money that
way. The nano sim, just like the mi-
cro sim was used to make more space
for tech. Apparently you can cut your
micro sim to nano sim proportions,
however for those of us who do not
have such steady ﬁngers, a rather an-
noying wait to use the phone starts.
The battery of the iPhone 5, like
most other smartphones, is not the
greatest. Often not making it past a
day and a half. However I had not ex-
pected much more, so I wasn’t really
disappointed. Sadly I cannot com-
ment on the LTE capabilities of the
phone, as at the time of writing of this
article a contract had not yet been ob-
tained.
All in all this phone is a wonder to
behold. Apple have really released a
great phone, combining a beautiful
design, powerful chip, cutting-edge
screen and a great OS to create one
of the best user experiences of the
market. The price may be a bit eye-
watering but you will get everything
that you paid for.
