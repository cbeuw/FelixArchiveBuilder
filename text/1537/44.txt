This week you have a dream
about the guy you’ve been
seeing, in which he’s as fat as
Henry VIII. Now every time you
see him all you can imagine is
being squashed during sex,
desperately clawing at his love
handles to escape before be-
ing suffocated. It’s going to be
awkward explaining why you
can’t see him any more.
This week you are bored of
sticking different vegetables
in your oriﬁces and decide
to be a bit more ambitious.
You challenge your friend to
a competition to see who can
stick the most 50p pieces up
their bum; everyone knows
the anal tract doubles as a
useful coin purse. First one
to £100 wins!
This week, you’re a snowﬂake.
You fall on queen’s lawn, mak-
ing it all scenic, and people
even build a snowman using
you and your mates. Then
boom, some twat rocks up
and sticks a hoodie on you
and gives you an umbrella
and all of a sudden you’re
part of some evil corporation’s
grad scheme marketing ploy.
This week you lose your cloak-
room ticket and they won’t give
your coat back without it. You
dejectedly leave coatless but
it’s -10 outside and snowing.
You crawl under a bin bag to
shelter yourself but immedi-
ately freeze solid. When the
ice thaws all that’s left of you is
your hair extensions and half-
digested McDonalds. Pint?
This week you fall into a deep
melancholy. All your house-
mates are having sex ≥ twice
a day and you haven’t had any
since Freshers’ Week. Sick of
only having your teddy bears
for company, you buy a life-
sized blow-up doll to ease the
pain. She gets a puncture while
you’re spooning and deﬂates,
along with your self-esteem.
This week that textbook you
bought in ﬁrst year and never
opened comes to life. It fol-
lows you around, wheezing
‘REEEAD MEEEE’ through a
haze of dust and cobwebs. It
rustles menacingly at you until
you reluctantly turn to chapter
1. Now it’s all happy and purr-
ing – see, it was just as lonely
as you were. BFF4LYF<3
This week you have a tape-
worm, which grows so long
that it extends out of your
mouth. You try to pull it out in
disgust but it clings on, plead-
ing with you to spare it. You
feel sorry for it and let it stay,
and become good friends.
But it can’t help ravaging your
insides, which proves fatal. At
least you won’t die alone.
This week you go to an inter-
view and do a massive nerv-
ous poo in their toilet (don’t tell
me you’ve never done one of
these). Unfortunately your inter-
viewer is after you in the queue
and can’t suppress a grimace
as you exit. Worse: you forget
to wash your hands and have
to shake everyone else’s with
very visible shit smears.
This week you have to prepare
a presentation. But when you
stand up to deliver it, your USB
doesn’t work and you com-
pletely forget everything you
were going to say. You stand
there sweating nervously,
pleading with your brain to let
you say something intelligent.
But then your time’s up and you
get 0%. Better luck next time.
This week you inhale the
whole world’s supply of
helium and ﬂoat carefree
across London’s skyline.
But angry scientists pull you
back down to Earth, furious
that you have wasted this ﬁ-
nite and precious resource.
They chop you open to har-
vest what precious little re-
mains.

This week you must choose
between having a strawberry
ﬂavoured condom dangling
from your nose or a forest of
pubic hair where your ﬁnger-
nails are. The condom could
be a useful handkerchief, but
the smell would get sickly. The
pubes may be a handy duster,
but picking your nose would
be hard. What’s it going to be?

Worst thing about this photo is that he’s wearing one of those shit “varsity American
jock” jackets. Unfortunately it’s not 2010 in Topman, so they’re not “in”. Twat.
