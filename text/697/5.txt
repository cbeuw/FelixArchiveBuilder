Once again FELIX takes a walk down Exhibition Road, looking into
places of interest that Joe Student/Joanne Student passes with half-
closed eyelids at 9.29 each morning. This week: a brush with religion,
and the opportunity to trace your ancestors.
NEWS FEATURED
EXHIBITION
ROAD SW7
CITY OF WESTMINSTER
If there is one building on
Exhibition Road that stands
out architecturally then it
must be the Hyde Park
Chapel of The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints. Perhaps its strange-
ness puts people off as well as
the connotation with strange
sects and religions. This is
despite the fact that a notice
board outside proudly
proclaims that the Visitors
Centre and Geneological
Library attached to the
church are open to all.
The Church was founded in
the 19th century by Joseph
Smith in America after a
vision. The church gets its
nickname, the Mormon
Church, from the Book of
Mormon that Joseph Smith is
claimed to have found on gold
plates buried near what is now
New York. Mormons are
keen to point out that they
believe in the Bible, but
because the Book of Mormon
has not been altered through
the ages to suit more wordly
aims it has clarity in places
that the Bible has not.
Mormons do not drink tea,
coffeee, or alcohol, and
claimn that scientific studies
show that they have a
significantly lower incidence
of heart disease and cancer.
There are Mormon Churches
in over 90 countries, and they
claim it is the fastest growing
religion in the UK. Part of this
success may be attributed to
the 30,000 active missionaries
the Church has wordlwide.
There is an exhibition in the
Visitors Centre where anyone
interested may learn a little
more about the Mormon
Church. Many people fear
entering a church out of
interest because they think
that they may be the target of
a high pressure religous sales
campaign. Indeed, perhaps
more so with Mormons than
any church because their
house-to-house calls have
given them a reputation of
being over zealous and
enthusiastic. However, the
Visitors Centre, with its
paintings, displays and
models seems to have none of
the aggressive paraphernalia
that would intimidate a casual
visitor.
The Mormons have a
system of proxy baptism for
their ancestors. Mormons can
be baptised in place of their
ancestors, to allow them to
achieve salvation. Obviously
to achieve this you have to
know who these ancestors
are, and to this end the
Geneological Library holds
details of over 40,000,000
people taken from parish
records on microfilm, indexed
by name and county. These
records date back into the
1600s, although for privacy
reasons there are no details of
anyone born less than 110
years ago. These records are
open to the public, and allow
anyone interested in their
lineage to make extensive
enquiries with ease.
The baptisms take place in
a jacuzzi-like bath, and the
baptism itself is performed by
total immersion. The
baptismal area, like
everything else in the
building, is without religious
ornamentation : no crosses,
no icons, no paintings - just
wood pannelling and
flourescent lights.
Religion tends to be a
subject that people decide on
and then stick with that
decision for the next 70 years.
Most have a rough idea what
the Church of England or the
Roman Catholic Church are
all about, but few students at
IC know anything about the
Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints. It may be
possible to pass through the
Visitors Centre without being
converted, but not without
being educated.
