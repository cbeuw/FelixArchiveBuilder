Southside bomb
scare fiasco
A bomb alert last Monday was virtually ignored by
Southside and Linstead Hall residents.
'It was fifteen minutes before anyone left and even then
not everyone did', a student told FELIX. 'Most students
ignored the bells as an evacuation signal', he added.
College Security Officer Mr
Geoffrey Reeves condemned the
response to the bells as 'not
satisfactory'.
The alarm was sounded after
an anonymous caller to the
College switchboard shouted
'There's a bomb in the building',
and rang off.
The College-wide bomb alert
signal (bells ringing for one
second and off for four seconds)
was sounded. The Halls of
residence do not have a warning
signal and only the evacuation
alarm (continuously ringing) can
be rung. No suspicious packages
were found during the initial
search, and the alarms were
switched off after half an hour.
Although not satisfied with the
Southside evacuation, ex-Chief
Superintendent Reeves, was
pleased with the response from
the rest of the College.
'Most of the people knew what
to do', he said. Mr Reeves was
also glad of the chance to test the
security guards' emergency
communication system. He was
reasonably happy with the way
everything worked, although at
least one messenger was seen
running around frantically
shouting 'Get out, there's a bomb
in here'.
â€¢In another incident, Which Mr
Reeves believes may be
connected with the bomb hoax,
Mine's building basement was
broken into last weekend.
Several unused lockers were
damaged for no apparent reason.
Mr Reeves said 'Someone has a
grudge against Imperial College'.

Up yours
a n
At the Valentines Birthday Party in the Lounge on Friday a large
crowd witnessed the antics of Screaming Lord Sutch, leader of
the Monster Raving Looney Party. Though described by Private
Eye as an 'alleged pop star' the rendition of'Jack the Ripper' was
particularly good involving swords, various axes, a policeman and
the dismembered head of Margaret Thatcher. Lord Sutch did not
sign any ballot papers.
College crime wave
Six handbags were stolen in
seven days around the College
campus earlier this month.
All were left unattended and it
is thought that they were taken
by walk-in thieves. Two of the
thefts were from Tizzard Hall
and the others were from various
departments. The local Crime
Prevention Officer has asked
students to report anyone acting
suspiciously or anyone carrying
more than one handbag, to the
College Security Officer
Geoffrey Reeves.
