SAILING
Exeter Triumph
Exeter v Southampton v Imperial
Reports of galeforce winds and
driving blizzards in the West
country did not deter the sailing
club from travelling to Exeter
over the weekend. The
physicists had soon modified the
minibus to provide television and
stereo so the team arrived with
good spirits (whisky, vodka,
gin..).
After a cold, sleepless night it
was with less enthusiam that the
teams viewed the icy, gale force
winds on Saturday. Pete Robson
showed his inexperience by
allowing himself to be
manouvered into a boat which
was soon capsized in the middle
of the river, to the obvious
delight of the more upright
spectators.
Exeter's secret war of attrition
continued with a riotuous party
on Saturday evening, and so it
was an exhausted team which
finally took to the water on
Sunday morning.
The first race saw Imperial
away well at the start, with Jones
sealing Exeter's fate by sailing all
three of their boats the wrong
side of the gybe mark, giving
several greens and then escaping
well out of the ensuing chaos
while Bevan and Ape sailed
through to first and second.
The second race saw Exeter
come back into it with a totally
unexpected victory. A change of
tactics at the start of the final
race saw Imperial starting fourth
and fifth with Robson again
practising his front crawl. We
lost!
With more wind against
Southampton the races
developed in to some what of a
processions. After two races
honours were even, so
Southampton elected not to sail
the decider because they knew
they'd lost it!
Many thanks to Exeter for an
excellent weekend—it is hoped
to avenge our defeat when they
visit us in March.
SNOOKER
Variable
form
Manor Park—5 IC—7
IC—2 Lensbury A—10
Two matches at the beginning of
the week seemed to provide an
excellent opportunity to
continue our recent winning
streak and insure a respectable
distance between Imperial and
the bottom of the table.
On Monday evening at Manor
Park things went roughly
according to plan. Although
under pressure after team
captain Mike Powell dropped
both frames to leave IC 5—3
down, John West evened the
match at 5 all and Ian Grindall
sealed the outcome, also winning
both of his frames.
The visit of Lensbury on
Tuesday evening provided
something of a contrast,
Lensbury are present league
leaders and, inspite of Mike
making amends for losing the
night before by giving us the best
of starts with a" 2-0 lead,
difference in league positions
was made apparent with an
emphatic 10-2 victory for the
visitors.
The annual Handicap and
Open Snooker tournaments will
