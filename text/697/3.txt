IC mag tops
The Phoenix, the literary
magazine of IC Union, was
praised last week when The
Spectator published a review of
student magazines.
Paul Johnson described it as
'the most satisfying of the
publications' looked at, and
continued to praise 'a great deal
of poetry, literary essays, general
articles, drawings, and not least
some excellent photographs'.
This year, The Phoenix will be
published at Easter and is edited
by Diane Love. It will be on sale
throughout the College.
CCUs to keep
carry-over
The Constituent College
Unions (CCUs) will be able to
'carry-over' funds at the end of-
the year and will continue to
.receive funds budgeted for on
five-year plans, it was decided at
Monday's Council meeting.
A motion, proposed by Mike
Osborne and seconded by
Maribel Anderson and Ann
Collins (the three C C U
presidents), was passed on the
vote after more than one hour's
deliberation. The motion was in
response to the Union Finance
Committee (UFC) policy of
January 17 1985, which reduced
the support from ICU for the
CCU's five year plan expendi-
ture, and decided that the CCU's
end of year balance should be
taken into account when
estimates are fixed.
This UFC policy effectively
prevented any end of year carry-
over of funds for the CCUs.
The discussion of the motion
at Council provoked much
heated debate, mainly between
the CCU representatives and the
President and Deputy President,
Ian Bull and David Parry. The
CCUs pointed out that they are
an integral but autonomous part
of ICU and should be treated
differently to the major sub-
comittees. Mr Bull replied that
they were integral only when they
wanted funds and autonomous
only when they didn't want to be
accountable.
The motion was passed with a
large majority.
The next motion, proposed by
Hugh Southey, Publications
Board Chairman, asked Council
to allow major sub-committees
to carry-over funds, as well. This
motion was defeated on the vote.
The Council meeting, the best
attended for several years, was
held at the College's field station
Silwood Park, near Ascot.
