Council really is the most
contrary body. After spending
half an hour at its previous
meeting bickering about holding
a meeting at Silwood when
everyone thought that would
mean it was inquorate, there were
so many members present for the
meeting that extra vans had to be
laid on to ferry them out to the
field station and the room
booked for the meeting was
busting at the seams. And what
was the reason for such
uncharacteristic enthusiasm on
the part of council members? It
seems that every last vote had
been rounded up to support a
move to give money back to the
Constituent College Unions that
had been taken away by a
previous meeting. The whole
issue centres on whether the
CCUs can keep money they have
left at the end of the year, usually
referred to as having a 'carry-
over', or whether it is returned to
IC Union.
Such detailed nitty-gritty of
Union finance is not the stuff
with which this column seeks to
enlighten you. However, you
may be interested to know that
later in the meeting when non-
smokers, who had been quietly
choking throughout the long
finance debate, complained
about the amount of smoking in
the room, a classic compromise
was reached. Smokers are only to
be allowed one cigarette per
hour. The problem is that, in line
with policy already adopted,
CCU representatives are able to
'carry-over' their cigarettes to the
next hour, whilst other members
must return any unused
allowance to the Deputy
Presidents.
