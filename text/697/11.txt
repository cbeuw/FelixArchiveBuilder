BOAT
Henley
win
The club had a successful start to
the spring term's events with
three wins and other good
placings over the weekend. At
Henley Fours Head, the Novice
Coxed IV won their division
convincingly beating all the
Senior CMB crew in the process.
As well as this extremely good
result the women's senior C
Coxed IV had an encouraging
race coming third in the senior B
division. The Women's Novice
IV racing for the first time gained
experience which will stand them
in good stead and help them
continue the rapid progress they
are making. At Watney Sculls
Head, Bill Bradury and Greg
Harding won the Senior B and
Novice categories respectively.
The College team of four scullers
came second overall to Thames
Tradesman. Hopefully Burway
Head will be as successfull and
the Novice IV will maintain the
sort of performance which gave
Bill Mason, their coach, ample
opportunity to comment on how
the crew with three months
rowing experience had beaten
the best crews of many of the
other clubs competing. You tell
'em Bill!
TABLE TENNIS
Magic
bat work
Saturday 16 February saw the
Central London League closed
championship come and go. This
year Imperial entered the largest
number of players for donkey's
years (seven) and hopes were
high for at least one notable
success.
The men's singles presented
problems for everybody, that is
nobody made it through the first
round. The men's doubles saw a
slight improvement with one of
our pairs actually making it to the
second round before being
knocked out. This left the
minor's singles (Divsion four and
below not under 12's), our last
hope for salvaging the pride of
Imperial Table Tennis, only two
of our players entered as they
were the only ones eligable and
both cruised through the first
round. After the second round
we had only one survivor left in
any of the competitions. After
beating a division one player in
his group in the men's singles
Andrew Lewry was confident
about doing well in the minors.
All went well until the quarter
finals when a delay between the
second and third game (caused
by Andy getting stuck half in, half
out his tracksuit jeans) unsettled
the flow of play resulting in our
final player being eliminated form
the competition.
Meanwhile in the League the
first team lost 5-4 again. The
second team won a tough fought
match 5-4 (thanks to David
Gallagher for some magic bat
work). The third, fourth and fifth
teams played but no results were
available at time of submission,
however from the league table of
Division 6 it looks like it will be an
interesting fight between the
fourth and fifth team for the
fourth from last position at the
end of the season.
Linstead
tops
The interhall Table Tennis
Tournament began in earnest last
Saturday.
With well over half of the 70
scheduled matches completed,
Linstead are at the top of the table.
They have managed to win eleven
of their sixteen matches so far.
Weeks and Garden are not far
behind, with nine victories out of
their sixteen matches (each) iast
weekend.
Even though Selkirk has only
managed to win six matches so
far, L Axelsson's record of four
wins out of his four allocated
matches is a consolation for
them—no other player has been
able to achieve sucri a stunning
performance.
Falmouth Keogh should be
grateful to their player, D Henty
(seed No 4) who, with his three
superb wins, has helped to keep
his hall in the race for the
championship.
16 and 17 of February will be the
climax of the tournament, with the
top three seeds of each hall
fighting to keep their respective
halls in a respectable position.
Table so fan-
Linstead 33 points
Garden 27 points
Weeks 27 points
Selkirk 18 points
Falmouth Keogh 12 points
OCTOPUSH
Underwater
what?
IC Octopush team is one of the
few College clubs short of
members due to students refusing
to believe it exists. However, this
week, the little known underwater
athletes scored an exciting victory
over Donesbury Sub Aqua Club.
The team arrived at Donesbury
sports centre at 8.30 and are
hurriedly made our way to the
unisex changing rooms, only to be
told that the match couldn't start
until 9.30 since the pool was
occupied by the women's
swimming team. Already hindered
by one player being absent due to
tummy trouble we patiently
waited for the pool to clear.
Underwater hockey, or
'Octopush' as it is more properly
called, is a game which normally
involves holding one's breath,
diving to the bottom of a
swimming pool, and knocking a
lump of lead around for 39 minutes
whilst opposing players start to
kick you over the head with large
black flippers. However,
Monday's match had the
interesting variation that a new,
experimental, extra light squid
was being used made of
aluminium. When struck with the
'pusher' (underwater hockey
stick) it leapt about six inches off
the ground and landed in the same
place again.
Things iooked set for a
meaningless 0-0 draw until a clever
IC defender discoverd that if you
hit the 'squid' (the aluminium
lump) very, very hard it actually
went backwards. Aided by this
knowledge, he made a strategic
withdrawal towards our own nets
which was followed by a blinding
mass of bubbles and the referee
soon declaring a goal having been
scored at the Donesbury end of
the pool.
So frustrated by this were our
opponents that several of them
abandoned the match and made
an early return to the unisex
changing rooms, hoping to catch
the women's swimming team. The
weakened opposition was then
unable to prevent a second goal
being scored which to the acute
embarassment of the luckless IC
forwards was also put in by our
goaly. The final result was 2-0 with
the aluminium squid being
unanimously declared a waste of
time.

BADMINTON
Unlucky
thirteen
Mixed II vs UC (away)
This was most certainly a case of
the 13 being unlucky—as far as
UC were concerned. In the very
first game of the match, one of
their players dislocated his knee!
(And IC were wining).
IC kindly agreed to a replay, to
take place in a week's time. Better
luck next time.?
Team: Chris Bean, Stuart
Cowperthwaite, Farida Katelli and
Anne Redley.
Mixed I vs UC (Home)
Whilst in the other UC match it
was UC who were the unlucky
ones, this match was the complete
opposite: IC lost the match by a
mere five points!
The reason for this is as follows:
Both IC and UC fielded only two
pairs (instead of three), which
meant that the match was the best
of four games. Both os IC's pairs
lost to UC's first pair, whilst
beating their second pair, leaving
the match even at two games
each. This meant that the winner
had to be decided by adding up
points gained by each
team—these being:- IC 89
UC94
Never fear, IC will hopefully win
the return match on Wednesday
20 March!
Team: Andy McAleer, Susan
Yeates, Ava Martivossian, Julie
Goodeve.
IC Ladies vs Kings (Home)
Despite a slight panic at the start
of the match when only five
players had turned up, this was
another successful game for IC
Ladies, as well as the fact that we
fielded a full ladies team!
The game of the match, IC first
pair against Kings first pair was a
tense nail-biting affair, but IC
finished with a narrow triumph
over Kings. Then, our third pair
placed both their games in
succession, to give IC another two
games. What with our first pair
wining their second game and our
second pair then winning both
their games, this meant that IC
had won six games, had three
conceeded (as Kings only had two
pairs), giving us a fine 9-0 win.
Team: Helen Gregory and Janet
Folkes (first pair), Susan YEates
and Anne Pedley (second pair),
and Farida Katelli and Anne Lister
(third pair).
