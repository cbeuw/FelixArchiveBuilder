Dune
The Dune Universe comes at
you like some madman's
dream of a technologically
advanced Victorian age—
gothic stone, brass and steel.
These, combined with the
sheer scale of the sets, all
serve to diminish the impact of
the players on the stage and
create the same depressing
image as put over by Blade
Runner—the idea that man is
dwarfed by his own constructs.
This concept is neatly
portrayed in the plot, which
centres around the feuding
between evil noble lords
(carefully orchestrated by a
totally non-evil emperor).
Things are complicated by the
fact that the son of one of the
lords is the end point of a 90
generation breeding pro-
gramme carved out by a semi-
religious s i s t e r h o o d . T h e
result is that the natives of the
planet Arrakis (also known as
Dune) acclaim him as their
saviour and proceed to assist
him to the emperorship of the
known universe, incidentally
destroying the evil noble
house on the way.
The acting is excellent, the
animation brilliant and the
sets superb—yet the film fails.
It is but a shallow reflection of
Frank Herbert's masterpiece.
Too many subtleties of plot
have been left out and too
much is left unexplained for
those who have not read the
book. However, the pith and
core of the book's plot are still
carried over, if in a somewhat
garbled form.
If you read, and enjoyed the
book Dune then go and see
the film—you will enjoy it
immensely.
If you have not read Dune
then don't bother to go—it will
be as incomprehensible as the
news in Welsh and a lot more
expensive.
SINGLES m&k
asrp"1
Julia and Company: I'm So
Happy
Remarkably summery new
soul single from the band that
brought us Breakln' Down.
O r c h e s t r a l b a c k i n g a n d
brushed drums all give this a
r e a l l y C a r r i b e a n f e e l .
Pleasant—very p l e a s a n t -
nothing special, but I can't
really fault it. Incidentally, the
rapremix of Breakln' Down on
the B is well worth spinning.
Jermaine and Michael
Jackson: Tell Me I'm not
Dreaming
Trying to boost the success
of brother no 6, Michael has
wrapped his golden vocals
a r o u n d t h i s e x t r e m e l y
mediocre track from the
album Dynamite. The single is
very catchy and stands a good
chance of top ten success. I
wish Michael would get on
with his own music though—
I'm dying for another Thriller.
This isn't in the same in the
same league.
The Bluebells: All I am is
Loving You
I do like the Bluebells sound
very very much. Melodious
w i t h o u t b e i n g b l a n d ,
harmonious without being
o v e r p o w e r i n g , a n d with
marvellously simple lyrics.
People will probably criticise
this because it doesn't try to
break new musical ground,
nor does it try to tell the
listener something politically
relevant, but at least it's
enjoyable to listen to. That is,
after all, what matters.
Lotus Eaters: It Hurts
After Last Picture of You it
appeared as if Lotus Eaters
would at long last become
commercially successful, but
it has taken another three
months for a quality follow-
up. This will be a big single.
Rather like Icicle Works or
even Colour Field, this is
s i m p l e but h a s e n o u g h
realism to make even John
Peel play it. Basically, a classy
record.
Dazz Band: Heartbeat
From the album Jukebox
(which also contains their last
hit Let It All Blow) this is a
much slower, almost ballad,
release than I would have
expected. Typically Motown,
with a very American feel, it's
much like 50% of the Top 40 at
the moment. Certainly, it's no
worse, but why is everyone
buying yankee soul when
w e ' v e g o t s u c h g r e a t
musicians of our own?
