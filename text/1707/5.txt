The End of the Union as We Know It
Pissed off paddy, Lochlann Allison, explains why the DUP are the greatest threat to any chance
of a successful Brexit.
COMMENT

A
fter a long day
of uni, I return
home to retire
for the evening.
I slump on my sofa and
flick on the tv to a comedy
channel for my daily
intake of shits and giggles.
The comedy channel I
refer to is, obviously, BBC
News. For the last two
weeks, I have watched the
comedy sketch, that is Her
Majesty’s Government,
with crippling anxiety and
debilitating uncertainty.
At this point, I think
I will be one of the first
to say it: Theresa May
has come away with a
workable deal.
The deal I refer to is
the “Irish-Backstop Deal”
which states that in the
event of a no-deal being
reached by 2020, no
hard border would arise
between the Republic
of Ireland and Northern
Ireland. Intended to
prevent a resurgence of
the sectarian violence of
the Troubles and signif-
icant economic damage
to border businesses, the
backstop deal would keep
Northern Ireland as part of
the UK, but in an annexed
EU customs union. The
Backstop deal was agreed
as an acceptable contin-
gency by the UK, the
EU and the Republic of
Ireland on Sunday.
In my opinion, the Irish
Backstop is favourable
to everyone and finally
puts the uncertainty of
the border in Ireland after
Brexit to bed.
Those in Generation X
should be happy with the
deal. If like me you’re
confused by generational
labelling, this is our
parents! Now be honest
with yourself and admit it:
your parents are massive
Brexiteers. The impend-
ing sense of doom you
feel at the dinner table
when you invite your
European friends over to
stay during the summer
sound familiar? The UK
finally leaves the EU
customs and is freed from
the clasp of Brussels,
which for many in the
generation before us was
a key reason for voting
Leave.
The Tommy Robin-
son’s (real name Stephen
Yaxley-Lennon), UKIP/
BNP/EDL supporters,
and the generally racist
should be happy at the
more stringent immigra-
tion laws in Britain. Even
businesses inside and
out of the UK should be
reassured at the prospect
of a more definite and
final deal being reached,
rather than the calamity of
a no-deal, hard Brexit. As
the border has been a key
issue in Brexit discussions
for some time now, it
would show strength and
stability to finally have
a contingency for this
aspect. And those that
live on the Irish/Northern
Irish border are just glad
that they don’t face the
prospect of having to
produce their passports or
file for visas just to drop
the kids off to school in
the mornings or to pick up
a pint of milk across the
border.
Everybody is, admit-
tedly questionably, happy.
Everybody, bar the Demo-
cratic Unionist Party.
The DUP defied their
allies, the Conservatives,
last week with a blatant
political warning shot.
The DUP, who have 10
parliament seats, top up
the Tories to form the gov-
ernment in a Confidence
and Supply agreement,
after May failed to secure
a majority in the 2017
snap election. However,
the DUP breached the
arrangement this week
when they voted with
Labour on a number
of amendments to the
Finance Bill, helping
them passing through the
Commons, in response to
the latest Irish-Backstop
deal. DUP Brexit spokes-
man, Sammy Wilson said
“the deal breached a fun-
damental assurance that
NI would not be treated
separately.” He went on to
say, “consequences were
inevitable,” referring
to their withholding of
support on the budget
vote.
Essentially, the DUP
have shown they are not
afraid to hold the govern-
ment and the success of
Brexit for the entire UK
to ransom if the terms
of Brexit are not to their
liking.
For many on the
mainland, this may be too
much to handle. There’s
a part of Ireland that’s
in the UK? And they
use the pound too? (I’ve
overheard these exact
questions be asked on a
flight to Belfast when a
passenger was informed
NI doesn’t use Euros.)
Who are the DUP, and
what gives them the right
to dictate our Brexit?
The Democratic
Unionist Party is the
largest political party in
Northern Ireland and the
single-handed reason for
why Northern Ireland
can’t have nice things.
Are you gay and want
to get married? Sorry,
DUP says no.
Are you gay and want
to order a cake to console
your sadness at not being
allowed to get married?
Nope, can’t have your
cake nor eat it either.
How about teaching
scientifically proven
basics about the Big
Bang and the origins of
the universe to secondary
school children? Of course
not! However, some
NI schools are looking
forward to introducing
the BTEC in Flat Earth
Studies next academic
year (Worth 4 A levels!).
They believe they can
be Northern Ireland’s
Brexit Champions by
stalling any deal that
treats NI differently to
Britain, when they can’t
even be the champion for
their own citizens in basic
human rights. What’s
funnier is the DUP think
they can lead/dictate the
UK government during
these Brexit talks, yet they
can’t even form a basic
government back home in
NI.
Only recently, Northern
Ireland celebrated setting
a world record for the
longest time for a dem-
ocratic nation to have no
elected government. How
did this happen you ask?
The NI Assembly disin-
tegrated after Sinn Fein,
the nationalist equivalent
of the DUP, failed to get
into bed with their equally
dysfunctional partner
(as required in the Good
Friday Agreement) after
it emerged the DUP had
been paying local busi-
nesses almost £500million
to needlessly keep their
boilers burning. It’s called
the RHI Scandal – look it
up! No other government
in the world, bar Trump,
would have survived this
colossal fuck up. MLAs
(NI Assembly Represent-
atives,) to this day, are still
receiving pay even though
no legislation has passed
since January 2017.
The accountability
of the DUP is perfectly
summarised in their MP
for North Antrim, Mr
Ian Paisley Jr. Paisley Jr
was suspended from the
Commons for two weeks
in September after it was
discovered he had made
an error of “gross miscon-
duct” when he failed to
declare a bribe from the
Sri Lankan government.
The DUP are the
epitome of political
ignominy and have no

US news is moving like constipated bowels
Until the new House sits in January, we won’t have much of anything going on. Gather round,

terseness.
RIP to a real one. Harry
Leslie Smith unfortunate-
ly passed away this week.
Left Forum will presuma-
bly be holding a candlelit
vigil.
Paul Manafort’s gonna
get the book thrown at
him, because he broke
his plea deal and lied
to federal investigators.
Chucklefuck.
Donald J. Trump (“J”
for “Jdiot”) is refusing to
believe his own govern-
ment’s report on climate
change. In other news, it’s
hot as balls in the Felix
office – take your snow-
balls and fuck off.
A new report indicates
the Trump Foundation
made no charitable dona-
tions last year, meaning
it should lose its 501(c)3
charitable status. Presum-
ably nothing will happen,
though, because Trump is
in charge and we live in
hell.
A survey of senior
Dem strategists suggests
Sanders is the frontrun-
ner. VINDICATION,
BITCHES. THIS IS
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.
Hillary Clinton is
kicking and screaming
while she’s dragged into
the future. She recently
commented on the “im-
portance of stemming
immigration” in Europe.
Is she center-right already
or am I gonna have an
aneurism? Guillotine her
already.
Dems are on track to
clinch their 40th House
pickup – the last unde-
cided race. They won the
last House vote with the
largest margin in history.
Wow, it’s almost like the
Republicans steal elec-
tions.
Breitbart is reporting
that Chuck Schumer is
willing to spend some
more cash on the border
wall. That’s exactly what
you do when you’re
hot off an election with
the upper hand, and are
feeling pressure from the
left wing of your own
party - shit yourself and
break your neck running
into the wall. I mean, Bre-
itbart is fake news, and I
only read it to laugh at the
morons in the comment
section, but whatever.
Trump is trying to
cover up his support for
Kashoggi’s killers by
telling everyone how
much we’re gonna make
from Saudi Arabia in arms
deals. How much more
cartoonishly immoral
does the ruling class
have to get before we can
sanction revolution in the
press?
Finally, good news – in
Detroit, undercover cops
tried to buy drugs from
undercover cops. They
tried to arrest each other
and the situation devolved
into a fist fight. This is
your brain on drug wars.
Alright folks, that’s this
week done. See you next
time for the end of the
world.
right to oppose the gov-
ernment on this deal from
behind the tactical facade
of “protecting the inter-
ests of Northern Ireland”
when they themselves
fail their constituents on a
daily basis.
The cause for their
opposition to the Irish
Backstop can be found in
a fragile insecure sense of
British identity. I cannot
stress enough the mag-
nitude of and effect this
insecurity has on NI. In
December 2012, Belfast
City Council voted to
reduce the number of days
that the Union Flag would
be flown over the City
Hall,inaminorcostsaving
attempt. This technique
had already been adopted
by numerous councils on
the mainland. Unionists,
however, believed this an
attack on the Britishness
of Northern Ireland and
sparked two months of
violent riots in the capital,
costing businesses £50
million in damages and
lack of sales over the
festive period.
Their exception to the
Irish-Backstop deal is
rooted in their belief that
this too is an attack on
Northern Ireland’s future
in the UK. Regardless if a
hard border in Ireland will
return our economic pros-
pects back to that of the
time of the Potato Famine,
spark a resurgence of IRA
hostilities (as the Police
Service of NI has warned
it would) or directly
damage the lives of those
living on the border, the
DUP will not settle unless
Northern Ireland is treated
exactly the same as the
rest of the UK.
As a Unionist, I do
not fear for the future
of Northern Ireland in
the UK with this deal.
Theresa May has continu-
ously highlighted NI will
remain part of the Union
in this deal for as long
as we wish to. I will still
feel British and retain my
British passport. Life, I
believe, will be largely
the same. The economy
should remain similar
thanks to no nasty fuck
ups from a hard border
and benefits from remain-
ing in the single European
market. Travel to and
from the mainland could
not be much harder than
it currently is. Present an
identification document at
the airport gate? Already
do that. Have my bags
checked by customs/
security? Already do that.
Submit to a voluntary
strip search? Perhaps not.
The border in Gibraltar
is what I envisage what
the Northern Irish border
could become. Passengers
off flights from Gibraltar
still have to pass through
customs regardless of the
fact that most Gibraltari-
ans hold British passports.
Goods also pass across the
Spanish border with very
little inspection. It has
been proposed a digital
surveillance system could
be used in NI to inspect
cross border movements
and this would negate
the need for any physical
border.
Do not let the DUP’s
disproval of the backstop
deal miscolour Northern
Ireland in your mind.
The NI Chamber of
Commerce, the Institute of
Directors NI, the Director
of the Civil Service and
the Ulster Farmers Union
all publicly support the
backstop agreement.
Large business with
close logistic links with
the Republic such as
Primark, McDonald’s
and Tesco’s have all
backed the deal. Some
consultancy firms have
highlighted the proposed
strategic advantage of
Belfast post-Brexit for
simultaneously enjoying
the benefits of being
both in the UK and EU,
leading to a potential for
huge development in the
city. Border communities
rejoiced at the proposal;
many can still remember
the border checks during
the Troubles.
I went home to Belfast
last weekend. Talking to
a local, he remarked “it
almost seems everyone is
happy with the backstop
agreement bar the DUP.”
And I agree with him.
It seems Paisley taught
them to stick by their club
motto “Never!” far too
literally.
So where does Theresa
May go from here.
She can’t just get rid
of her DUP crutch. She
signed a deal with the
devil and has to live with
it now.
Furthermore she can’t
implement the Irish-Back-
stop deal thanks to the
inevitable opposition
she will face from the
DUP and the rest of the
Commons in passing any
Brexit bill through the
Commons. Even though
this is the option most
acceptable to Brussels as
well.
I think the technical
term is she is fucked and
by deduction, the UK is
also fucked.
To be fair, you did bring
this upon yourselves. You
also deserve this fate
for thinking a bunch of
Belfast politicians would
help make Brexit a
success. Belfast couldn’t
even build a ship without
sinking on her first
voyage, what made you
think Brexit would be any
different?
You may have noticed
I also changed referring
to the UK from “we” to
“you.” Yes, well that is
because I’m jumping ship.
Residency in Northern
Ireland allows dual cit-
izenship of the UK and
the Republic of Ireland
and I’m in the midst of
applying for my Irish
passport. You may be
leaving the EU and have
to file for a Visa every
time you want to wear
your Speedos in Magaluf,
but I’m not. That’s my bets
for Brexit fully hedged.
I wish you all the best,
and I will see you on the
other side of whatever
way this shit show ends
up. But when you have
meme sources like Jacob
Rees-Mogg and BoJo
leading the country, who
needs luck, eh?
voted Brexit because a
big red bus said the NHS
would get £350million
more each year, with no
consideration for what
Brexit actually meant
for the country. You
“May is
fucked and by
deduction, the
rest of the UK
is also fucked.
