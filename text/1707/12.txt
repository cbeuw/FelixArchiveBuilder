Hello Ian. There are some things that I would like to
talk to you about regarding your exhibition…
... trapping people in the exhibit by not making the exit clear, while clever, does not actually boost attendance
figures.
A
lone again. I
had two tickets.
VIP ruddy tick-
ets and no one
bit. Although having been
to the exhibit, let it not be
said that the students of
Imperial had bad taste. I
jest. Some.
Hislop occupies an
odd place in our national
consciousness. He enjoys
acting like an outsider,
happily jeering at the “es-
tablishment” yet does this
from his position as an
established and comfort-
able member of it. Even
his position as “the most
sued person in England”
(Independent, 2011) does
little to distance him from
the people he attacks. A
wise man once said “A
BBC panel show does not
an anarchist make”. In I
Object, Hislop attempts
to make a virtue out of
cocking a snoop at the
powerful and weaves a
narrative through a history
of people doing so. He
tries to show that he is
only the latest iteration
in a long line of comics
and satirists that stretches
back through history.
It is an interesting
idea and a laudable one.
The British Museum
stands for empire, even
more so than Hislop,
and their willingness to
acknowledge alternative
histories is a positive
development. There is,
however, a problem. I am
not sure that this narrative
exists. Cruikshanks, the
19th century cartoonist
and icon of Hislop’s (he
has written a play about
him), features heavily and
delights with humorous,
crude and colourful depic-
tions of anyone from the
king to the common man.
ThisisamanafterHislop’s
heart and it shows.
However, yet again, there
is a flip side. Cruikshanks
was also known for his
xenophobic views and his
anti-abolitionist drawings,
curiously absent from the
exhibition.
At the other extreme,
the woven Afghan rugs
that feature Soviet tanks
and South Korean lino
prints of elderly, weeping
“Despite the
numerous
placards, the
exhibition
feels disjointed
and lacking in
unity”
“In some
cases, the lack
of context is
irritating and
hamstrings
under-
standing”
workers are a far cry from
the cheeky thumbing
of the nose that Hislop
aspires to. These are visual
cries of horror and to place
them among cartoons
shows a misunderstanding
of the realities in which
they were conceived.
This means that despite
the numerous placards
and the endless pictures
of the little man, the exhi-
bition feels disjointed and
lacking in unity. Not even
by including the Banksy
prank – a slab of concrete
with a drawing of a
prehistoric man pushing
a shopping trolley, put
up in secret in the British
Museum – can the exhibit
be redeemed, nor the irony
diminished of such an
anti-establishment piece
being celebrated. The slab
looks instead like a lion
head, a trophy on the wall
that stares glassily out of
its case.
The exhibition adds
insult to injury by putting
on show pieces of gov-
ernment propaganda. The
remains of a statue made
specifically to shame a
woman, old fashioned
‘revenge porn’, and a
carving of Cleopatra in
a compromising sexual
position; these constitute
not protest, but state-spon-
sored smears. Their inclu-
sion makes a mockery of
the exhibition’s purpose
of highlighting the weak
attacking the strong
throughout history. This
is a sniggering mix of
serious and obscene, and
visitors get what feels like
a giggling schoolboy’s
desk turned upside-down
to expose graffiti carved
on the underside. The
scarfed and bespectacled
public nods and hums.
‘pussy hat’ is a charged
object, even as it sits,
plonked on a wooden
mannequin head under
lights, the yellow umbrella
of the Hong Kong democ-
racy movement may be a
less understood symbol
to some. To show off
items that once stood for
so much without explain-
ing them is a pointless
gesture. Most people will
not be able notice that a
character is misspelled in
a piece of Chinese callig-
raphy from the Cultural
revolution and even when
told will not appreciate its
significance. That requires
a complex understanding
and too many words for
a small placard. In other
cases, the lack of context
is frankly insulting. To
include a coin with the
pope depicted hanging
from some gallows is to
forget the Catholics that
were killed in England
during the Gordon riots.
This is a celebration
of a popular Protestant
anti-Catholic sentiment
that should be viewed as a
darker part of our history,
rather than a cheeky side
note.
All in all, the exhibition
is boring. Items with their
lives and vitality wrung
out of them sit empty
and without context. You
could walk around the
bizarrely laid-out room
for hours and not really
gain any greater under-
standing of anything. The
funny man seems to have
forgotten a very basic rule
of comedy. Once you have
to put a sign underneath a
picture explaining that, by
putting a red hat on Louis
XVI’s head, the author is
being funny by suggesting
that the king was a revo-
lutionary, the joke is dead.

In some cases, the lack
of context is irritating and
hamstrings understanding.
While nearly any modern
visitor will be able to
appreciate how the pink
Waydown,Hadestown:astoryoflove,lossandwonder
L
ights went off as
soon as I took
my seat. Jazzy
Hermes filled the
stage with snappy tunes
and energy. He introduced
Eurydice, Orpheus and the
inevitable tragedy waiting
to happen in Hadestown,
the realm of Hades. A
Greek myth transported to
a post-apocalyptic Great
Depression era setting,
Hadestown by Anaïs
Mitchell made me laugh,
cry and wonder. Disguised
as a love story, carefree
Orpheus falls in love with
strong willed Eurydice
only to lose her again, and
again, and again.
The story is about
self-sufficient Eurydice
who just craves warmth
and food in the harsh cold
winter. Orpheus who is
madly in love with her
wants to cater for her
needs but all he can give
her is his incomplete song.
Hermes identifies this
song as the song of the
gods, and when Orpheus
sings, his sweet melody
makes flowers bloom
and winter seem almost
tolerable. Enchanted by
this, Eurydice falls in love
with Orpheus who in turn
hurries to finish his song,
so winter can end.
Tired of waiting, and
with Hades and Perse-
phone’s marital strife,
Eurydice is approached
by Hades who gives her
the choice to sign off her
soul to him, so she can
work in his factory in
the underworld. And she
agrees. Terrible decision.
The premise of the play
is Orpheus’s adventure to
save and bring back his
girl.
Upbeat, energetic
music being a personal
favourite, nodding and
tapping to the beat was
inevitable. This was also
true for the rest of my row.
All performances were
lively, with Persephone
(goddess of vegetation and
Hades’ wife), portrayed
by Amber Grey, giving a
sensational performance
and bringing a contagious
positive energy to every
song.
The best part of the
show was a routine
done in the underworld
when the miners chant
about their treacherous
working conditions and
Persephone being aghast
by the industrialism of
Hadestown. The clever set
design made it a spectacle
because of the combi-
nation of the awe-factor
and simplicity. Mining
lights and a revolving
platform conveyed the
struggles and problems
that everyone – god or
sold soul – has.
I watched the show
expecting to be surprised.
And I was. The unpredict-
able turns kept me capti-
vated and engaged (more
than some lectures I sadly
admit). There were times
when the cast would stare
into space, but it felt like
they were looking straight
at me so that I, too. was
somehow involved. The
overarching themes of
unity, revolution and
righteousness with the
song ‘Why We Build the
Wall’ are particularly
relevant to our times.
The character portrayal
of Orpheus felt like some-
thing was amiss. Orpheus
had a boyband-ish persona
which made him seem like
an outsider in comparison
to a well-knit, classical
cast. Yet, somehow the
beauty of the tragedy and
the spectacular routines
made this passable.
The lost love just
showed how easily
humans can complicate
simple lives. We should
all just live a little and
worry less. Possibly by
watching the play again,
and again, and again.
Switzerland: Patricia Highsmith is deeply unlikable…
but is there more to the iconic author?
P
atricia Highsmith
(portrayed by
Phyllis Logan),
the American
author of some of the
most beloved murder
novels such as Strangers
on a Train and The
Talented Mr. Ripley,
is visited by Edward
Ridgeway (Calum Finlay)
in her retreat bunker in
Switzerland. Ridgeway, a
young publisher, has been
sent there to convince
Highsmith to write one
final Ripley novel.
The production is thrill-
ing and captivates the au-
dience from the get-go. As
the exchange between the
characters heats up and
cools down, as the dynam-
ics change, the tension is
truly palpable. This is, for
the most part, thanks to
the wonderful acting by
Logan and Finlay, who
portray two very unlikea-
ble characters. Highsmith
especially is made to be as
unlikeable as possible in
this production, spewing
hate with each sentence
that comes out.
The stage design is
particularly unwelcom-
ing and fits the theme and
the characterisation per-
fectly. There is a sense of
unease even prior to the
actors taking centre stage.
The Swiss Alps visual in
the background is slight-
ly tacky, though. Maybe
a little too on-the-nose
for my liking, driving the
point that we are, in fact,
in Switzerland. It’s not
like they never mention it
throughout the play.
The play is far from
perfect, with little char-
acter development up un-
til the climax. Even then,
there isn’t much giving
these characters a third
dimension. All we know
is Highsmith is a nasty
woman, and Ridgeway is
a young, charming pub-
lisher. Yes, for those fa-
miliar with Highsmith’s
work, Ridgeway does
in fact present a striking
similarity to Tom Ripley,
although this is a tad too
subtle for those who are
not. The twist near the end
may be a bit confusing for
the latter group, although
when it happens, it’s not
exactly a shocker; though
a chilling conclusion to a
thrilling plot, it isn’t par-
ticularly surprising.
In conclusion, Switzer-
land is, on paper, a won-
derful idea, exploring
the author’s relationship
with her most beloved
character. In practice,
though, it is let down by
the script which does not
allow for character de-
velopment and relies on
the audience being fa-
miliar with Highsmith’s
work. The actors deliver a
high-quality performance
with the script they have
been handed. While the
play does make for an
entertaining evening
out, and might leave you
wanting to sift through
Highsmith’s catalogue, it
doesn’t do much more.
