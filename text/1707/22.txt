N o v e m b e r ,
I m p e r i a l ’ s
keenest and
finest runners went on an
adventurous trip to one of
the most hotly anticipated
events in the autumn term
running calendar.
It was long, it was
girthy, it was fast, and it
was flat. Yes, you guessed
it, it was the Brighton 10k.
With only a few hours
sleep, the runners got
up at 5AM to take the
train to the south coast
of England. Some of the
team were surprised to
find out the employees of
Southern Rail were not on
strike at that time of the
day.
At 9:30am sharp the
race began with the 51
Imperial students compet-
ing against 2000 runners.
The weather was perfect,
with no clouds in the sky
and the mercury staying
firmly above 50 C.
Niki Faulkner lead the
team with an amazing
pace; keeping up with
some of the best runners
in the field. He managed
to finish the race in 31
minutes and 52 seconds!
Wow!
The Club Captain,
Fergus Johnson, managed
to score another great
result, finishing the race
in 35:02, and registering
a new personal best in the
process.
Another PB was earned
by Euan Bell, who came
third in the Imperial men’s
rankings, finishing the
race in 37:14.
ICXCAC’s ladies also
ran great times; scoring
some amazing results and
reminding us why they
are in the first place of
the cross country league.
The club was glad to be
visited by one of the club
legends, Anna Lawson,
who lead the ladies with
an amazing time of 38:34.
The Imperial alumna
commented, “I finally
got a sub-40 10k!” That
probably excludes splits
in the many cross country
races and marathons she
has done.
Alex Mundell, a former
Club Captain put in a lot
of effort, finishing the
race with a superb time of
39:30.
Back on the men’s
side it was surprising
seeing James Millet, one
of the finest young track
athletes, taking part. He
likely treated it like any
other 800m race, done
12.5 times back-to-back.
Great effort, James! It
only took him 35:47
seconds to finish the race.
At the scene, Millet
questioned, “Why is this
race so long?!”
The club eagerly awaits
his debut in the cross
country league, as he
could help the men’s team
take a higher position
in the ranking. Maybe I
should have talked about
him in the first paragraph
of the article, but hopeful-
ly he will not mind.
It was a great day to see
some new faces in the club
running at fast pace - faster
than the wind. Some of
those were Lucas Kreifels
and Cedric Ormond who
ran the race in 38:14 and
39:38 respectively. Alix
Vermeulen ran her first
10k in an amazing 39:49,
proving herself a strong
contender for the Fresher
of the Year award. Keep
the momentum going!
Well, my friends,
after reading those par-
agraphs about how well
everybody did, you are
probably wondering how
I found the race. The race
was great, the sun was
smiling and I think I know
the answer to “Who was
first, the chicken or the
egg,” as at some point
I found myself racing
a giant inflatable duck.
That is when I realised I
needed to step up the pace
and finish the race with a
decent time. I also think
it was sunny enough to
start building my base tan.
It was great having other
members of the club who
could not run that day
cheering and supporting
their fellow students.
The wonderful
Women’s Captain, Char-
lotte Barratt, celebrated
her birthday with the club
that day and made sure
everyone was able to get
some top quality face
paint with personalised
designs.
While I was running
I could hear Secretary
Duncan Hunter shouting,
“You’re a tank! You’re the
predator, he’s the prey!”
I’m not sure what he
was referring to - maybe
Remy Shaieb, who ran an
amazing sub-40 race.
In the afternoon, our
athletes headed to the
beach to chill and chat.
We had some interesting
discussions about rocks
and how they are so
simple, yet they can repre-
sent the complex society
we are part of. All rocks
are different; they come in
different shapes and sizes,
but they are still happy
to lie next to each other.
When you look into the
distance you cannot tell
them apart - all you can
see is the beautiful beach
that never ends.
Until next time, keen
beans!
