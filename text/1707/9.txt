The Overstory: a giant redwood of a novel

T
his is not our
world with trees
in it. It’s a world
of trees, where
humans have just arrived.”
Ecological catastrophe,
perhaps the biggest issue
of our generation, has
never been more vividly
portrayed than in Richard
Powers’s twelfth novel
The Overstory. After
making his name with the
award-winning The Echo
Maker in 2006, Powers
has graced the literary
world with a series of
spellbinding tales. In this
latest ambitious novel
he challenges the selfish
exceptionalism of humans
through the eyes of nine
tree-activists. The central
message is clear: we are
disconnected from a vast
natural world surrounding
us.
The story is structured
into four sections resem-
bling the morphology
of trees: Roots, Trunk,
Crown, and Seeds.
In ‘Roots’, he introduc-
es us to the nine protago-
nists, a range of characters
from a wide variety of
backgrounds: an airforce
loadmaster who is saved
from falling by a banyan
tree in the Vietnam War; a
couple who, in an attempt
to save their marriage,
plant a tree in their garden
every year only to be su-
pernaturally rewarded; a
1980s college student who
electrocutes herself and
is mysteriously brought
back to life; a disabled
botanist who discovers
trees communicating with
each other and eventually
publishes a seminal book
which becomes the bible
of a new movement.
The botanist is Dr.
Patricia Westerford, a
woman whose years spent
researching forests are
prematurely mocked fol-
lowing her findings about
trees communicating (a
real discovery – see The
Hidden Life of Trees by
Peter Wohlleben), but
who is later congratulated
and vindicated.
As one becomes
familiar with the ideas
behind her findings, it is
clear that the chemical
interactions between the
trees are symbolic of
the later relationships
between the characters.
Powers’s language is
meditative yet scientific
– “In summer, water rises
through the xylem and dis-
perses out of the million
tiny mouths on the under-
sides of leaves, a hundred
gallons a day evaporating
from the tree’s airy crown
into the humid Iowa air.”
He cleverly integrates
his obvious scientific
knowledge with literary
talent, resulting in a book
which is both poetic and
educational.
Following the discrete
and unrelated backsto-
ries in ‘Roots’, the later
sections see the charac-
ters’ lives become inter-
twined. This slower-paced
part of the book allows us
to see how the characters’
unique and meaningful
connection with trees
drives their pursuit of
the same interests, and
ultimately leads to them
taking up the same cause.
By focusing less on the
characters and more on the
central theme, the author
urges us to reconsider our
relationship with Mother
Nature.
While it may be argued
that such powerful themes
reduce characters into
mere rhetorical devices,
Powers raises pressing
issues which cannot be
ignored. Just this month
it was announced by the
Met Office, in its first
major update on climate
change in 10 years, that
UK summer temperatures
could be 5.2°C hotter by
2070. Moreover, the US
National Climate Change
Assessment has found that
climate change is to in-
creasingly “disrupt many
areas of life” in the future
through consequences
such as crop failures,
wildfires, flooding, and
altered coast lines.
Despite these warnings,
the politicians of the
world are slow to act, as
demonstrated by President
Donald Trump ordering
further deforestation of
North America’s tree
population. The message
is apparently not clear
enough.
The climax of the
novel centres around a
protest against the logging
of an old forest. Some
of the characters adopt
‘alter-eco’ names (“maid-
enhair”, “moss-eater’)
and camp atop a giant
redwood for a year to
prevent the felling. Day-
to-daylivinginthecanopy
is described in detail.
Despite the absurdity
of the situation, Powers
succeeds in capturing the
urgency and scale of the
problem at hand.
I guarantee there will
not be many things about
trees left to know after
reading this book. It has
even left me pondering
the trees outside my door.
Trees have lives of their
own: they eat, breathe,
have sex, form networks,
alert others to a threat.
You will never look at a
tree the same way again
after this story.
Why a multifaceted,
512-page novel to combat
the climate change issue?
Richard Powers answers
this from within his own
pages: “The best argu-
ments in the world won’t
change a person’s mind.
The only thing that can do
that is a good story.”
Interwoven storylines of nine characters merge like roots of a tree to produce a narrative which powerfully warns
of impending worldwide ecological collapse, in Richard Powers’s Man Booker-shortlisted novel.
