Oddbox provides a
service where it collects
wonky, too big, too small,
scratched fruits and vege-
tables that don’t meet shelf
standards from supermar-
kets and farms across the
country and delivers them
right to your door. Every
week you receive a box
(you can choose size and
type) full of a variety of
different produce starting
at just £8.99 per week.

shoppers at the point of

Leading a sustainable
lifestyle is not expensive
or constraining. On the
contrary you will eat
better, save money by
wasting less (on average
UK households waste
£700 worth of food), all
in all contributing to pre-
serving the planet.
So why not take a chal-
lenge and try one of these
apps today?
An app a day keeps the greenhouse effect at bay
Apps can provide food for thought and your belly
To start, a few facts:
12 million tons of plastic
end up in our oceans each
year. One third of all food
produced globally goes
to waste. The greenhouse
gas emissions involved
in the production of food
which go to waste mean
that if food waste were a
country it would be the
third largest emitter of
greenhouse gases, after
China and the US.
This is astounding,
and should make all of
us think twice. Each of
us can contribute to com-
batting climate change by
changing our daily habits.
There is no magical
solution to this problem.
But there are small steps
individuals can take to
make a change. To do so
is to get informed and
involved. The smartphone
is a brilliant tool to do just
that. So, without further
ado, here is a list of eight
apps (all free) and services
to help reduce food waste.
This website has a host
of tips and tricks on how
to waste less food, as well
as recipes and ways to
store food for longer.
Too Good to Go
provides a solution to
the problem of leftover
food in restaurants and
cafes being thrown away.
Through the app, outlets
can offer leftover food
at a discounted price.
Every day they estimate
how many portions they
will have left at the end
of the day and users can
buy them. At closing
time, you just go to the
selected venue and collect
your food. Portions vary
depending on how much
is left each day but these
can be very big, way more
than you would usually
get for that price. (Side
note: Wasabi also does
50% off all food left 30
mins before closing). The
app Karma provides a
similar service, offering
50% off food from various
locations. Shops selling
discounted groceries are
also included in this one.

Olio is a platform for
users to post unwanted
food (and non-food items)
to prevent them from
going to waste. Users
interested in the item get
into contact and arrange
a pick-up. Olio also has
volunteers partnered up
with cafes and restaurants.
At the end of the day they
collect the leftover food
and post them on Olio for
everyone to benefit from.

recipes for what you have
leftover in the fridge: half
an onion, one carrot, an
open can of chickpeas...
You can choose cuisine,
portions, staple dishes
etc, and quickly whip up
something delicious.
Giki allows you to scan
supermarket products and
find out if they are healthy,
sustainable and ethical. It
suggests alternatives for
those who don’t comply
to these and guides you
through sustainable
grocery shopping.
This app finds the
nearest refill water
stations to fill up your
reusable water bottle. No
need to buy plastic bottles
anymore!
Selling and buying
second hand clothes has
never been easier. On
this peer to peer social
shopping app, the photos
of the clothes are sur-
prisingly good, price and
state are described. In
addition no need to pick
the piece up, the clothes
are shipped directly to
you. Sustainibility is
also about recycling and
upcycling, trying to keep
products, foods etc in the
cycle rather than throwing
them away and buying
new ones.
Critics point out that
an app does not equate
to action. Proponents
argue that apps create an
entirely new means to
tackle issues, like Giki

Brazil – This week
Brazil’s government
announced that it will no
longer be hosting the UN
global summit on climate
change next year citing
costs. The conference
could cost Brazil up to
$100 million. Brazil
spent $4.6 billion on the
2015 Olympic games and
it is expected that $33
trillion worth of damage
worldwide will result
from climate change by
2050 according to a 2016
report. Brazil’s prime
minister, Mr. Bolsonaro,
has called manmade
climate change a plot
by “Marxists” to stifle
economic growth.
Going on in
the world
