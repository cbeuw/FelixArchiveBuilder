Immortals Fight Back Against QMUL Vipers
F
or the first time
this season we
faced a new
opponent, the
Queen Mary Vipers.
Our squad was much
improved from last week,
due to an addition of new
recruits, and the return
of our starting running
back Jonas “Vegan Bull”
Eschenfelder, coming
back from a hand injury.
With the Queen Mary
grounds being so close
to London, Jacob our
Gameday Manager,
decided to book a “Gatis
Special” coach, which
reached full capacity for
the first time this season,
leading to some close en-
counters. The additional
numbers were welcome,
but we are still looking to
recruit.
After a bit of special
team tactical adjustments
and an extended warm-up
featuring everyone’s
favourite Zip-Drill punc-
tuated by Frans’ usual
moans about his shoulder.
Both teams were ready to
take the field. Unfortu-
nately, due to a flag on the
field for delay of medics
the game started late. The
Vipers hit us hard on their
first drive, mostly due
to their girth-y statures,
and finished with a
touchdown. However, we
responded with a 60-yard
drive of our own that un-
fortunately was cut short
at the foot of the end-zone
due to a holding penalty
on one of our players.
On defence, we reacted
with an excellent fumble
recovery by Nikolai
“Smice” Smirnov to set
the offence up on Queen
Mary’s 40-yard line, and
hoping to pound the ball
into close vicinity of the
end-zone. Unfortunately,
a couple of drops in the
red zone meant we were
unable to capitalise. At the
end of the half our defence
suffered two lapses which
lead to two Viper TDs
in the last minute of the
half, putting the score
at 24-0. Undeterred,
we came back out and
scored a touchdown of
our own, with a catch by
Daniel “Old Windsorian”
Loughran, who redeemed
himself after a particular-
ly pathetic false start on
the previous play. On the
following QMBL drive,
Ed “Ballhawk” Martin
produced an insane pick
6 that included five shed
tackles, making the score
24-14 halfway through
the third quarter. For
the rest of the game
the defences reigned
supreme, apart from an
amazing one-minute drill
down that went for 80
yards and ran out of time
at the 5-yard line. This
last minute effort included
a 35-yard scramble by
our QB Ben O’Brien, and
deep contested catch by
“Magic” Mike Corio. Un-
fortunately, this still meant
a defeat for us. However,
there were plenty of pos-
itives to be taken away
from the game, with our
offence having made
more yards than the Vipers
and our defence looking
very robust apart from
right before half-time. A
special shout-out goes to
Thomas “Flipper” Smith
for fulling transitioning to
his new offensive lineman
role.
With a bye-week in our
sights, we are looking at
improving even more and
creating an upset against
Kent in mother Harling-
ton before the mid-season
break. If you want to
