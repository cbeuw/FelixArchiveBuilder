Remembering the Boxing Day Tsunami
How chocolate biscuits saved my life.

D
ecember has
always been
a time of deep
reflection for
me. As the lights erupt
and the Christmas spirit
envelops the nation, it
truly is a special time
of the year. However, it
makes me value the im-
portance of family and
the sanctity of life for a
very different reason.
contemplating career
choices and planning New
Year’s Parties, I pause for
a moment to appreciate
how phenomenally lucky
I am to still be here today.
On Boxing Day 2004, I
was in Galle, Sri Lanka,
one of the cities worst
affected by the tsunami.
back during the holidays
to visit my family and
friends. In 2004, my elder
brother, my mum and I
travelled to Sri Lanka for a
3-week holiday spanning
Christmas and the New
Year. My dad was tied
down at work and had to
stay home in Norwich.
On Boxing Day 2004, I
was woken up at 6 am by
my mum. We were in my
uncle’s house in Colombo,
the capital of Sri Lanka.
Once I got through the
initial confusion of being
woken up so early, I was
overcome with excite-
ment. We had planned to
go on a two-day trip to a
coastal town on the south
coast called Tissa. This
meant pools, beaches
and ball games – what
more could an 8-year-old
want? The travelling party
consisted of my brother,
mum, two cousins, aunt,
uncle and myself.
We travelled along
the south-west coast
- world-famous for its
golden beaches, exuber-
ant marine life and surfing
opportunities. I watched
inquisitively as the fish-
ermen brought in their
morning’s catch – little
did I realise that, for many
of them, this would be
their last day’s work. At
around 9 am, we took a pit
stop in Galle, one of the
largest cities in the south
of Sri Lanka. Galle is a
bustling city embellished
with a giant 16th
century
fort, overlooking the Galle
International Cricket
Stadium. We parked the
van outside ‘Food City’,
a supermarket much like
Sainsbury’s or Tesco, as
my mum wanted to get
some snacks for the rest
of the journey. Initially,
my mum was going to go
with my uncle, leaving me
in the van with my brother
and cousins. However, she
then said something that,
and out of the aisles like
a hyperactive PacMan
until I found my target. I
was stood in front of the
biscuits aisle, expertly
perusing the range, when I
heard my mum screaming.
I ran towards my mum,
who was stood in front of
a large glass window, and
I was shocked by what
I saw. The city of Galle,
was submerged in 15
feet of dark, violent sea
water. Innocent people
were being thrown around
like rag dolls. Buses, cars
and tuk-tuks were being
flung into buildings, as
if they were weightless
toys. Amidst this chaos, I
saw something even more
terrifying. Our van, with
the scrambling silhouettes
of my brother, cousins
and aunt inside, was being
battered by the waves
before being completely
submerged.

life. She said, “Lasith are
you coming? You can get
some chocolate biscuits”.
Being a somewhat rotund
8- year-old with an insa-
tiable sweet tooth, this
was an offer that I could
not resist. I jumped out
of the van and eagerly

apparent. ‘This is serious,
people are dying around
me, my brother might die’
lapped through my head,
each cycle exacerbating
my hysteria. We watched,
helplessly, as people tried
to clamber up buildings
to get to safety, only to
be mercilessly swatted
away by the waves. As
time went on, the hysteria
transformed into frank
consideration of how my
life would be without my
brother – thoughts that are
beyond the usual remit
of an 8-year-old. ‘We
will never play cricket
together again, he’ll never
see me go to university,
I’ll never see him get
married’– each simulation
of his absence making it
tantly appointed widows,
widowers and orphans,
flooding every nook and
cranny. A second and
third wave had struck the
city, deepening wounds
and quashing hope. Then,
4 hours after the ordeal
began, our prayers were
answered. A soldier, who
had been called to the city
at this time of crisis, came
to me and my mum, and
told us that my brother was
safe, and had been taken
to the house of a local
family on high ground. He
was with my two cousins.
My mum and I were
overcome by an intense
soldiers and reunited with
my brother.
Once our emotions
were finally under control,
my brother told us of his
experience. As the water
started sweeping the van
down the streets of Galle
and the possibility of
drowning became very
real, my brother smashed
the window and they all
crawled out. At this point,
the powerful torrents sepa-
rated them. My brother got
entangled underwater in a
web of fallen telephone
cables, causing a large
laceration on his back. He
managed to wriggle out
only to be swept towards
a canal running through
the city. The canal was
a particularly dangerous
area – vehicles, rubble and
people were being sucked
in as if it were a black
hole. If you were swept
into the canal, that was it.
My brother was pushed
treacherously close,
however, he managed
to hoist himself onto a
tree by the side of the
canal. One of my cousins,
similarly, grabbed onto a
tree trunk whilst the other
drifted close enough to
my brother, such that he
could pull her up onto the
tree. Once the waters had
calmed, they were taken to
safety at a nearby church.
My aunt had been swept
over a kilometre before
latching onto a fence and
being taken to safety.
Rather unexpectedly,
my uncle, who entered the
water after the first wave
had struck, was worst
injured. He had badly cut
his foot and lost a lot of
blood. He was found un-
conscious and taken to a
local doctor who managed
to dress his wound and
resuscitate him. In the
evening, once the water
had receded for the last
the mighty power of the
sea. 6 minutes, and the
outcome could have been
very, very different.
Every December, I stop
to think about the 230,000
lives that were lost and
the many millions of
lives that were irreparably
destroyed that day. If not
for a very fine margin, my
family could have contrib-
uted to that total. As we
live our pleasant lives in
London we may complain
about coursework, exams,
relationships and all sorts
– when the going is (rela-
tively) easy we often find
something (relatively)
petty to pin our dissatis-
faction on. It’s almost as
if humans have an in-built
dissatisfaction quota that
must be fulfilled and it
is often allocated to the
least pleasing thing in our
lives at the time. I’m not
trying to undermine issues
‘lesser’ in magnitude than
a natural disaster – these
problems are, of course,
of utmost importance to
the individual who suffers

time, we were taken by an
army convoy to pick up
my uncle and head back
to Colombo. Thanks to
the time difference, my
dad was fast asleep whilst
all of this unfolded. As he
unassumingly switched on
BBC news in the morning,
he was met with ghastly
images of apocalyptic
destruction with mounting
death tolls in South Asia.
Fortunately, by the time
he called us, we were all
safe and sound. Reflecting
upon this experience
churns an eclectic col-
lection of emotions. The
intense feelings of poten-
tial loss that burdened me
that day are juxtaposed
by the elation that we
survived against all odds.
My mum and I had been
in Food City for no more
than 5 minutes before
the tsunami struck. We
were intending to be in
there for no more than
5 minutes. Therefore, if
the tsunami had struck
6 minutes earlier or 6
minutes later, our van may
have been on the road in
thick traffic, vulnerable to
“Innocent
people were
being thrown
around like rag
dolls”
“Buses, cars

were being

if they were

toys”
feeling of relief. All those
piercing thoughts that
were tormenting me will,
thankfully, never enter
the realm of reality. We
were then escorted by the
progressively harder for
me to breathe or think.
My uncle was in a
particularly bad state. His
entire family was in the
water, unaccounted for.
He made the courageous
decision (arguably, his
only option) to enter the
water to search for his
family. My mum and I
remained in Food City,
praying to Gods we didn’t
routinely believe in, to
perform a miracle on
our behalf. I specifically
remember bargaining with
non-specific supernatural
powers, explaining that I
will strain every sinew for
the rest of my life to make
a positive difference to
this world, if I could only
have my brother back in
return.
The city was enveloped
in pain and misery - the
cries of newly and reluc-
them. However, every
now and then, I feel it’s
important to take a step
back and be humbled by
the fragility of human
life, and appreciate how
phenomenally fortunate
we are to be alive and
have the capability to
make a positive difference
to the world, no matter
how big or small that may
be. Enjoy your Christmas,
embrace your family
and friends, place your
worries in the backseat for
just a moment, and spend
some time counting your
blessings.
