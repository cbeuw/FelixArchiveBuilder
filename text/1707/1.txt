Imperial and
The Times and
The Sunday Times was
officially launched this
week.
The “What the hell is
going on?” event marked
the start of a year-long
collaboration, which will
feature joint events to
“advance shared interests
in the future of science
and culture”.
Tuesday evening saw
Times journalist and polit-
ical satirist Matt Chorley
joined in conversation by
universities minister, Sam
Gyimah. The discussion
covered politics, changes
to higher education and
the tuition fee system (as
reported in last week's
edition of Felix), and the
future of British research
and innovation in the
wake of Brexit.
When first announcing
the partnership, Imperial
College Union president
Rob Tomkies said: “We
are very excited about..
this partnership and the
potential it has to benefit
the student community at
Imperial."
Emma Tucker, deputy
editor of The Times,
said: "The Times and
the Sunday Times are
delighted to partner with
Imperial College London
to promote our shared
belief that it has never
been more important for
young people to develop a
breadth of knowledge and
to stay up to date with the
news.”
Tomkies added: “We
see this relationship as
a way of exploring the
broader issues around
journalism, communica-
tion and culture – empow-
ering people to lead and
communicate in all fields,
not just their scientific
specialism.”
Tothisend,thedirection
of the collaboration will
largely be student-driven.
The selection process for
five student ambassadors
is currently underway.
Those chosen will have
a key role in designing
and organising events, as
well as representing the
partnership on campus.
Ambassadors will also
have access to training
and workshops with Times
journalists.
All students and staff
have been given a year’s
digital subscription, which
also provides access to
subscriber-only content,
benefits, and events. Sub-
scriptions can be activated
via an Imperial email link.
