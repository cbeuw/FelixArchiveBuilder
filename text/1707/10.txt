I bet tubas look good on the dancefloor
The ten-piece brass band takes to the stage to play through Arctic Monkeys’ 2006 bestseller Whatever People Say
I am, That’s What I’m Not in its entirety, reinvigorated and reimagined.
H
ow often have
you dreamt of a
live show con-
sisting of just
the Arctic Monkeys’ first
album, cover to cover? If
your answer is like mine –
nigh on every night – then
ten-piece brass band, the
Old Dirty Brasstards,
have got your back. With
four trumpets, three trom-
bones, two percussionists,
and a tuba, the Old Dirty
Brasstards frequent The
Blues Kitchen with their
blues, swing, and jazz
covers for Friday night
party-goers looking for
a night-club alternative.
This was their first foray
into a ticketed headline
gig, and what a triumph it
was.
The anticipation for
the gig was built around
a month in advance, when
out of the blue (heh)
Facebook targeted adver-
tisements suggested the
event. It was with good
fortune that I chanced
across the tickets before
the release as they sold out
within the hour, prompt-
ing the addition of three
further London dates and
even a trip up to Sheffield.
The disco ball-lit room
dimmed and the band
members sauntered on
“The melody
was shared
between the
lead trumpet
and trombone,
with bass lines
by the tuba”
stage, instruments in
hand, and immediately
launched into ‘The View
from the Afternoon’. The
main melody was shared
between the lead trumpet
and trombone throughout
the evening, with bass
lines being picked up by
the tuba and remaining
trombones. Each track had
an added twist imposed
by the band, most notably
a samba feel on ‘Dancing
Shoes’. The atmosphere
built through the set, as
the audience danced,
drank, and sang their way
through the massive 2006
album.
The Old Dirty Brass-
tards gave an almost
theatrical performance,
with tight melodies and
rhythms, and plenty of en-
couragement for audience
participation. There was
even a hand-painted sign
that was held up for the
“da-da, da-da-da” section
after the second chorus of
‘Still Take You Home’.
Much like all Arctic
Monkey gigs I have been
to, the crowd came alive
for the instrumental bars
after “He’s a scumbag,
don’t you know!” in
‘When the Sun Goes
Down’ and sang their
hearts out to ‘Mardy
Bum’. That being said, I
have never before been
to a gig where there are
chants of “tuba! tuba!
tuba!”…
My only slight criticism
is that with no frontman to
lead the crowd through
Alex Turner’s carefully
crafted lyrics, the au-
dience’s singing left a
lot to be desired, which
sometimes seemed to put
off the band, particularly
during ‘You Probably
Couldn’t See for the
Lights But You Were
Staring Straight at Me’.
Personally, I believe the
occasional messy verse
and tempo differences
added to the whole expe-
rience; the iconic nature
of the album and the brass
band lends itself to a mass
crowd singalong, even if,
to some amusement, the
verses are muddled or
people come in too early.
The highlight of the
night must be the unex-
pected encore, where we
were treated to three more
Arctic Monkeys songs; ‘R
U Mine?’, ‘Fluorescent
Adolescent’ and ‘Brian-
storm’. There is no doubt
that every member is an
incredible musician with a
love for Arctic Monkeys;
one trombone player even
wore Tranquillity Base
merch! I don’t think this is
the last we will hear of the
Old Dirty Brasstards – I
cannot recommend them
highly enough. If they add
more dates or expand their
repertoire to Favourite
Worst Nightmare, I’ll
certainly be the first one
there.
