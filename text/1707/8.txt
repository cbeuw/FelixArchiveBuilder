founded by
Erald Veliaj, launched this
summer at Goldsmiths,
University of London and
has now opened up for
Imperial. The application
automatically connects
students based on infor-
mation such as the course
they’re taking, what coun-
try they’re from and who
share common intentions,
such as finding other stu-
dents to rent a place with.
“Network is re-
thinking the university

reports
show that

reports show that the
number of students having
an unpleasant university
experience has been on
the rise. “The problem is
much broader than just
the university experience.
There is a vulnerability in
our society,” Veliaj said.
“We are empowering
students to interact freely
with one another and
to really focus on other
students around them with
similar intentions and
interests, increasing the
chances of teaming up re-
garding university course-
work or personal projects,
and creating meaningful
relationships. Instead of
watching artificial content
from celebrities that is
irrelevant to the student’s
reality and moreover has
a negative effect on their
wellbeing, students can
connect and create a peer
support system, leading
to a bright professional
future.”
“Network is designed
in such way that allows
students to become part
of the whole community
unlike traditional appli-
cations that only allow
users to start with a small
number of connections
and limit their reach at
some point. Content, con-
nections and possibilities
are moving with time
and change,” Veliaj said.
“Even though we have
now opened up to Imperial
and Goldsmiths, Imperi-
al’s network will remain
closed. Students will only
be able to interact with
other students and view
content from their univer-
sity, allowing them to feel
comfortable expressing
themselves.”
It is exclusivity this that
makes Network special.
“Keeping it exclusive
allows us to develop a
product that students
love,” Veliaj said. “We
are not putting numbers
before doing the right
thing for the students that
use our service and this
is a really good time to
do that because embed-
ding that culture really
early in our business is
extremely important. In
the end it really comes
down to values and we
are focusing on keeping
Network valuable for
students. We will continue
to innovate and deliver
great services for students
and we know that if we
listen to their feedback
and provide them with
things they love, they’ll
use our services.”
Despite being exclu-
sive, Network is also
setting new industry
standards, rethinking the
way students interact
with each other and how
content is organised.
First students have to set
up their account by com-
pleting basic information
about themselves such as
the course they are taking,
what year they are in, if
they are living in the uni-
versity accommodation
or not and the country
they are from. Once
they complete the setup
they are automatically
connected with students
in their class, in the same
course, in the same depart-
ment and from the same
country. Students can also
look up other students that
are looking for a place to
rent or that are renting a
place out.

“Network is
rethinking
the university
experience”
part of a community, but
that community is not
visible to you right away.
You have to go out and
figure it yourself. In the
majority of cases, you find
yourself missing out on
meeting people or doing
things that you are really
interested in because for
one reason or another
you are concentrating on
the wrong part. Network
provides students with the
tools to view and better
understand the communi-
ty they are becoming part
of as soon as they join
Imperial, and that instant-
ly opens up a whole new
set of possibilities.”
“Looking
at the big
picture, there
are so many
problems
Network could
solve. One of
the problems
it tackles is
dating.”
“We are
trying to push
students
away from
the distorted
reality of
competing
with their
friends for
likes and
attention
and really
helping them
build deeper
relationships.”
“Accommodation is a
huge problem in London
and we are thinking of
new ways to tackle this
problem,” Veliaj said.
“It is quite hard to find
other students to share
a place with and we
want to change that. Not
only should students be
able to easily find other
students to share a place
with, but they should
also find students from
the same department or
with similar intentions.
That way students don’t
have to live with people
they don’t like, and that
would change the student
social experience tre-
mendously. As a student
myself I am aware of the
university regulations.
When I stopped living in
the university accommo-
dation halls I still had no
other option than to pay
for the whole term since I
wasn’t able to find another
student to take my place.”
Looking at the big
picture there are so many
problems Network could
solve. One of the problems
it tackles is dating. “If we
think about dating, it all
starts with two people
introducing themselves
as friends. Once we give
students the ability to get
to know other students
with similar interests and
intentions, it’s up to them
to decide if that someone
should be their date or
not, it’s very simple and it
happens naturally, ” Veliaj
said. “It doesn’t have to
be this vulgar application
aimed only at dating.”
“Fundamentally we
are trying to achieve two
things,“ Veliaj said. “The
first one is encouraging
students to do more ac-
tivities together, either a
group of students planning
something together or one
student joining an activity
organised by someone
else. If someone is
partying or playing tennis,
other students should be
given the chance to join
them. Traditional appli-
cations do not support
this because by the time
the other person sees that
someone is having a party,
chances are that the party
is already over or too far
away to get there in time.
We have the luxury to
make this happen because
university campuses are
small and centralised and
it’s the perfect place for
students to interact with
one another. The second
thing we are trying to
achieve is to become the
main hub for students.
Helping students cooper-
ate with one another re-
garding different projects
will lead to the creation of
a new platform where the
new influencers will arise.
Myself being a Creative
Computing student I
envision that a growing
self-supporting commu-
tionality that wouldn’t
be possible otherwise.
“Our team approaches
problems with almost a
blank canvas,” Veliaj said.
“Having that open mind-
edness and willingness to
approach problems from
different angles is really
important. We’ve not
only managed to build a
product, but have also laid
an underlying philosophy
that runs directly counter
to traditional applications.
We are trying to push
students away from the
distorted reality of com-
peting with their friends
for likes and attention and
really helping them build
deeper relationships.”
