White City Woes

As the Chemistry
d e p a r t m e n t
approaches the end
of its first term at
Imperial's new White
City campus, Felix
investigates the issues
that have arisen
Andy Djaba
Editor-in-Chief
A
utumn 2018
saw the
opening of
the Molecular
Sciences Research Hub
(MSRH), which rep-
resents a new research
home for the Depart-
ment of Chemistry on
Imperial’s new White
City campus. With the
first term in White City
drawing to a close, Felix
reached out to various
staff and students across
all levels of the Chem-
istry department, from
undergraduate student to
postdoctoral researcher
and beyond, and invited
them to reflect on their
experiences of the new
building and campus.
The two questions that
were asked were, “how
have you found the move
to White City in this
first term?” and “what
issues have you seen/
experienced associated
with the move to White
City”.
In a staff briefing sent
out via e-mail on Friday
16th November, Professor
Alan Armstrong, Head of
the Department of Chem-
istry, was quite positive
about the move to White
City. Although acknowl-
edging that “no move is
easy” and recognising that
there have been “teething
problems”, Professor
Armstrong enthused
about the open layouts for
office and write-up areas,
which “provide a great
contrast” to the buildings
in South Kensington and
“allow greatly improved
interactions between
researchers, which is
already leading to better
collaborative working
and cross-pollination of
ideas”. Although many
of the staff contacted by
Felix shared Professor
Armstrong’s sentiment
that many of his col-
leagues have been “struck
most by how the building
really has changed” the
way they interact with
each other, this rather
glowing assessment of the
move to White City has
not proved to be accurate
amongst the majority of
staff.
confusing information
surrounding logistics of
packing of equipment/
chemicals etc.”
This member of staff’s
complaints were con-
sistent with a number of
other members of staff
and also with many of the
students and researchers
that have been relocated
to the new building. One
major recurring issue was
the general feeling that
the move to White City
was poorly managed. One
post-doctoral researcher
reflected on the “serious
issues in the planning and
handling of the moving
process” as follows:
“Information passed
on to us earlier this year
from people involved in
the planning process was
that a ‘one size fits all’
policy had been applied
to building design, i.e.
all floors will be built to
near-identical specifica-
tion and corrections made
as and when necessary.
The diversity of research
requirements in the
department makes this
a totally infeasible ap-
proach. This has affected
both our ability to settle
in to the new facilities,
and the rate at which other
issues can be addressed.”

“I'm pretty
disgruntled
by the lack of
help and lack
of caring over
this”
“Probably the
main issue is
the amount of
time that we
lost”
and getting everything
across to White City has
challenging. I think, given
that complexity, it’s gen-
erally gone as well as you
can expect. Recognising
what a complex scenario
we had, it was inevitable
that there were going to
be some things that aren’t
perfect and it was actually
pretty good.”
One major issue that
stemmed from the per-
ceived mismanagement
of the move is the signif-
icant loss of time while
moving. That is to say,
the move caused large
periods of “downtime”,
during which research
groups were unable to
conduct any research and
were, instead, assisting
with the relocation of
labs. One member of staff
added, “most students had
to take at least 3 months to
prepare, relocate and set
up their laboratory space.
However some were
affected more than others,
particularly students
where there was only 1 or
2 group members respon-
sible to move an entire
laboratory.”
This sentiment was
shared with a particular
post-doctoral researcher
who provided Felix with a
comment:
“I get the impression
there probably should
have been better planning
in the initial stages. Our
impression has been pretty
good actually. There have
been problems. Some
of our equipment took
a month after we had
moved to arrive. It’s kind
of essential to what we do.
So effectively for a month
we couldn’t work as we
normally would have
been working. Compared
to other people it’s not
that bad but again it’s
not great for us. We’ve
had a bit of downtime
on each side. There was
sort of disrupted works.
Some groups have had 3
months downtime. I don’t
think it’s been particularly
well managed. Obviously
the completing of the
building and stuff was
relatively planned far in
advance but I think things
like where each individual
group was going and what
equipment and spacewas
needed was last minute so
I think that’s probably a
large source of a number
of the problems.”
reimbursement. This has
been a source of major
confusion, particularly for
post-doctoral researchers
who are still not com-
pletely aware whether the
department or the College
will provide any sort of
financial reimbursement
for lost time. Some re-
searchers even went so far
as to accuse the College
of a misappropriation of
funds given for research
projects. “We were given
money to look at devel-
oping drugs for cancer
and Alzheimers research
and not to cover a relo-
cation budget shortfall by
moving boxes.”
Post-doctoral research-
ers, who work on a fixed
term contract, were left in
the dark for long periods
regarding the possibility
of reimbursement. Final
year PhD students, who
also suffered from a
similar loss of time and
productivity, have been
reimbursed with an exten-
sion of a month (or two,
depending on the circum-
stances). One researcher
explained:
“You have a fixed term
contract and that time is
the time you have to do
work so, if you lose a
month of work… we’re
not getting that back at the
moment unless the depart-
ment decides to reimburse
us for that lost time. The
funding agency employed
us to work for that time.
There was a month where
we couldn’t work because
of the move and we were
doing other stuff, setting
things up, moving things,
cataloguing etc. Arguably
a breach of contract.
That’s not really fair to us
or for our careers. It’s not
great to lose a month of
time where you could have
been employed. So I think
they haven’t done a lot to
even address that. There
should be more of a policy
in place because they’ve
done it for final year PhD
students, who’ve got an
extra extension of a month
or two to cover that. So
they’ve just not addressed
that with postdocs at all
and it’s as important for
us as it is for them.”
When reflecting on
Professor Armstrong’s
staff briefing, one member
of staff commented, “It’s
PR isn’t it? It doesn’t
really have any basis
in reality. It’s whatever
they want to go out. Just
like any business.” The
general sentiment of staff
and students at White City
has been less than posi-
tive, with one member of
staff describing the move
to the campus as “poorly
managed and a terrible
experience overall”. They
elaborated further, stating,
“We (the students/staff
moving the labs) received
very little information in
the months prior to the
move and then were told
4 weeks in advance our
specific moving dates.
This was coupled with
facilities not operational
when we arrived, limi-
tation on the hours that
we can actually do our
work. Deep impact on the
career of the researchers,
the overall trajectory of
the groups. Incredible
impact on morale." This
researcher went on to
beg the question, "Why
the hell did we have to
move at this particular
time, when the building
was not ready and they
knew it was not ready?
It should have been left
another year until it was
absolutely spick and span.
Then the move could have
taken in a much more
efficient way."
Professor Armstrong
has acknowledged that
the building is still incom-
plete and provided some
explanation as to why the
move still went ahead:
"That’s completely
true, there are two floors
below ground where no
research groups have
moved in yet. Essentially
the whole building project
overran. Originally, for
a long time, the building
was going to be handed
over in February and then
it switched to April. It
kept edging forward and
eventually it was handed
over in July and we had
to make a decision, do
we start moving or not?
All the way through, what
we’ve been trying to do is
to minimise disruption to
students, so we wanted to
move during the longest
holiday period we could.
Summer. So, even though
two floors are not finished,
we decided to go ahead
with the move. That’s
absolutely true, there are
two floors that are not
ready but we’ve done
what we can to mitigate
disruption.".
The building not being
completed has lead to
numerous issues. One
member of staff com-
plained:
"Drinking water taps
and toilets go unrepaired
and lifts are often out
of service for weeks at
a time, as well as other
more major issues which
When approached for
comment, Professor Alan
Armsrong said the follow-
ing:
“It has been an incredi-
blycomplicatedoperation.
That’s the first thing to
say. We’ve got everything
ranging from biology
labs, laser labs and, of
course, chemicals, so the
whole process of moving
stem from inadequate
design of the lab facilities.
In light of this, the lack
of presence of Estates
facilities or external con-
tractors throughout much
of the building is striking.
These problems faced by
researchers, staff and stu-
dents alike, are invariably
described as ‘temporary’.
Whilsttechnicallytrue,for
a department comprised
primarily of temporary
workers - be they under-
graduates, postgraduates
or postdocs - this is of little
consolation. Postdocs on
short-term contracts risk
losing out on grants and
further positions if their
research output drops; it’s
unclear if the significant
downtime caused by the
move constitutes a breach
of contract in cases where
a postdoc is contracted
to conduct research work
only. This situation is
far from an unqualified
success.
The staff and students
generally recognised the
inherent complexity of or-
chestrating such a move,
acknowledging that “in
a departmental move of
this scale, snagging is
unavoidable, and a new
building is always going
to have teething prob-
lems”. However it was
felt that “mismanagement
of the move has cause
huge losses of time and
research output, which
will disproportionately
affect those whose time at
the College is limited”.
A further source of
grievance that has re-
sulted from this loss of
time is the question of
In response to the com-
plaints from post-doctoral
researchers in particular,
Professor Armstrong said
the following:
“All the way through,
we were trying to min-
imise disruption but
something this complex,
it was always inevitable
there was going to be
some and I think the fact
that the handover was
delayed and the final
few weeks kept shuffling
forward a week meant
there was uncertainty as
to exactly when we were
going to move right near
the end. We’ve said that,
on a case-by-case basis,
we will make up for lost
time. We have paid an
extension to their PhDs
for the downtime and
we dealt with those first
because the end of their
PhDs was September and
that was right in the move
period. Often people get
a lot of their results at the
end of their PhD, that’s
the most productive time,
when you’re frantically
using the last time in the
lab and that was the time
the move was at the peak
so we made the decision to
act on the final year PhD
students straight away
and we gave almost all of
them a bursary extension
to cover the lost time.
We’ll do the same for 2nd
years and 1st years when
the time comes. If they’ve
still got a year and a half
funding left, we’re not at
the stage yet where their
money stops so we’ll deal
with it on a rolling basis.
One researcher summa-
rised the issues that have
been experienced since
the move as follows:
"Building not being
complete, disability
access not being clear,
“Importantly,
I want to
clarify that the
occupation of
a new, more
modern,
facility is a
positive thing”
Although largely neg-
ative, the feedback from
this move was not all
doom and gloom. Some
positive feedback was
received regarding the
layout of the laboratory
and study spaces. One
PhD student said the fol-
lowing:
"It cannot be overstated
how much the office
working environment for
chemists has improved
in the new building – for
the majority it is the first
time researchers have ex-
perienced bright and clean
office space."
This assessment was in
keeping with some of the
positives included in Pro-
fessor Armstrong's brief
and, when asked what
the department's response
to criticism would be,
Professor Armstrong said:
" What we could do for
example is, now people
have been there for a few
weeks, we could put out
a survey that says let us
know what your thoughts
are. We might pick up a
load of little things that
sometimes bother people
but they don’t feel they’re
big enough to talk to a
member of staff. I think
it would be a really good
idea, now that we’re in
there and people have had
a month or 2, to say what
is missing? The amount
of people that have been
involved in the project
from Estates, safety, as
well as the researchers,
it’s actually pretty stun-
ning that we’ve got as
much done as we have.
But I completely agree,
there was no way it was
going to be perfect and
there are things that were
not perfect and we’ll put
them right and we’ll listen
to whatever students have
to say."
The White City campus
very much remains a work
in progress.
“I think
fundamentally
what most of
the White City
campus really
is, is a land
grab. Really,
Imperial
College is
not a science
institute, it's
a real estate
business”
