Secrets, a new
venue for students to
safely vocalise their
inner thoughts and feel-

Originally gaining large
amounts of traffic due
to students mistaking it
for an extension of the
Felix centrefold, Impe-
rial College Exposed is
now one of the staples
of Imperial student
interaction with the
College reportedly con-
sidering it as an option
for supplementing the
overburdened student
counselling service.
Bamish Heck, 23 and

through a really hard
break up and I just didn’t
know where to turn.
When I found out about
Imperial College Exposed
I realised what I really
needed was to splash my
problems all over the
Internet and make thinly
veiled references to the
people involved. Sharon if
you’re reading this, I still
love you.” In further state-

have found the amateur
psychology practised in
the comments incredibly
helpful. “The comment

Of course, Imperial

just a venue for students
venting their personal
problems, it’s also a place
where students complain
about their course,
complain about their
housemates and complain
about their relationship
Taking all things into
consideration, Imperial
College Exposed is
now the sole forum for
mass student discussion
at Imperial. Given the
void for people to scream
into? This correspondent
is unsure, but if one thing
is for certain, the Imperial
ban hammer comes for all.
Except Memeperial, but

Apparently your

Dear Felicity,
I’m a bit stuck. I’ve never been rejected from anything, but my personal
tutor has told me to apply to more than one job. I feel like it would be
inappropriatetotellhimrejectionisn’treallymything,andthatanything
I want I’ll get, but a failure to fill in more than one application is still a
failure (and I don’t do failures). I passed my driving test first time, have
neverbeenrejectedforadate,andgotundergraduateoffersfromOxford
AND Cambridge. Yeah, they broke the rules for me. Anyway, the idea that
I should be expecting some sort of a rejection has got under my skin, and
it’s sort of putting me off. To be honest, it’s keeping me from applying
to stuff and this is a new feeling. How do I deal with this? It’s pretty soul
crushing…

Dear Ms Ked,
Thank you for your
letter. Unfortunately,
we have decided not to
take your application for
advice any further. We
receive hundreds of letters
each week and it is not
feasible to offer advice
to each applicant directly.
After careful consider-
ation, we have deemed
your letter not fit for
advice, as it is our view
that you do not have a real
problem. We appreciate
that ..you are interested in
our advice, and encourage

This week you protest
against the lack of
inclusive food in Fusion.
Some of us are averse
to seasoning, you know!
#BlandLivesMatter
This week it’s your first
job interview. When
asked about a recent
failure, flustered, you
start blabbering about
the time you failed to
secure a wine at Carnival.
Tragic.
This week, you’re excited
for Christmas. Or maybe
you’re anxious because
of exams after Christmas.
Who knows, they’re the
same physical reaction
anyway.
This week you think it
might be a great idea
to buy roller-skates.
Probably easier to knock
people out of the way on
Exhibition Road than zig-
zagging like a buffoon.
This week you’re the
resident Felix psychic.
How are you expected
to see the future when
the light at the end of the
tunnel is so dim?
This week you can’t
wait for your boyfriend
to finally shave off that
ridiculous moustache.
He finally does and you
realise it wasn’t really the
moustache..
This week, you’re the
ICSMSU President.
Apparently medics tend
to be into BDSM. Why
else would you add an
extra year at Imperal just
to go to Council?
This week your
application to form a
safe space for ‘arrogant
pricks and the medically
insufferable’ gets
rejected. Apparently it
overlaps too much with
FinanceSoc.
This week your mum’s
church friend asks for
help with her son’s Mech
Eng uni applications.
What would Jesus do?
Sabotage their UCAS to
prevent future pain?
Let the Lord use you.
This week you decide
it’s time to start
‘networking with industry
professionals’.
Is that what they’re
calling it these days?
You do you, sis.
This week you comment
‘lol same bro’ on an
Imperial College Exposed
post. You get 13 likes.
Alice Gast’s PA hires you
to run the Counselling
service.

you encounter another
problem that lines up
more closely with our
values.
