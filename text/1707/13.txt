National Youth Theatre’s genderfluid Macbeth:
Claire Chan talks to lead actors Olivia Dowd (Macbeth) and Isabel Adomakoh Young (Lady Macbeth).
“It was very
much that
they wanted
a female
Macbeth
and a queer
relationship –
a relationship
between two
women – at the
heart of the
production”
T
he National
Youth Theatre
Rep company
is finishing up
an exciting performance
season with their new
genderfluid version of
Macbeth. Abridged by
Moira Buffini and direct-
ed by Natasha Nixon, it
certainly is an intriguing
premise! I had the oppor-
tunity to sit down with
Olivia and Isabel and find
out their thoughts on the
production.
This interview has been
edited and condensed for
clarity.
Q: It’s a very new
production of Macbeth.
The whole idea is that
it’s genderfluid – what
exactly does that mean in
the context of the play?
I: We use the term
genderfluid to refer spe-
cifically to the casting, in
that characters who have
been traditionally played
by men can be female,
and vice versa. So two
of the witches are male,
and Macbeth is a woman,
which is very exciting.
Q: I was just wondering
about the casting – are
there specific decisions to
make certain characters
male and certain charac-
ters female? Macbeth is
female, but Lady Macbeth
remains female – it’s not
like a genderswap.
I:You’dhavetospeakto
the creative team to know
the whys and wherefores,
but I think the idea was
that they wanted to get the
best actor for each role, re-
gardless of gender. Except
for Macbeth. It was very
much the idea that they
wanted a female Macbeth
and a queer relationship
– a relationship between
two women – at the heart
of the production.
Q: So the relationship
between Macbeth and
Lady Macbeth is a queer
relationship.
O: Yes. They’re
married, just as they are in
the conventional Macbeth.
But I think it’s interesting
that Macduff and Banquo
are male, and Macbeth is
female. She’s a warrior
amongst male warriors, so
what does that say, what
questions does it bring
about for the audience? It
could have been a totally
different play if Macduff
was also female. But here
it’s still a man’s world,
especially on the battle-
field – there are moments
in the play where we still
use the language “I dare
do all that may become
a man”, and, “What, are
you a man?”
Q: That’s very interest-
ing, is it supposed to be
the original script? In the
original text, there are so
many references to gender
and ‘manliness’ – Lady
Macbeth tells Macbeth
to man up and do things.
How is that going to
work now that Macbeth is
female?
I: Yes, it’s absolutely
the original text. Moira’s
streamlined it a little but
all the famous speeches,
the dynamics of every
single moment of the
original text are still there.
O: Well, we’ve sourced
back to it! I mean, she
(Isabel) says “Are you a
man?” and I say, “Aye,
and a bold one”. It still
exists! It is still a patri-
archal world and that is
still currency between
us. Whether that’s a dig,
you know, like “Are you
a man?”, as if that would
be an insult, or it’s like,
still “man up” because
that’s seen as power. To
be manly, to be masculine,
we still use that language.
I: Absolutely. And
I think what’s really
interesting about having
both Macbeth and Lady
Macbeth as women is that
Macbeth has chosen for
her life path to lead into
the military, and she very
much judges herself based
on masculine standards.
Whereas Lady Macbeth
plays a more domestic
role – she’s chosen to
be the partner to a very
high-flying person rather
than to be the high-flying
person herself. It com-
plicates things, certainly,
but also makes it more
interesting.
Q: Okay. So the play
was centred around
Macbeth being female
and the queer relationship
between her and Lady
Macbeth, and the rest
of the cast just fell into
place?
I: Yeah, I would say
that was more or less the
shape of things. There
were certain central tenets
of what we wanted to
make the production, but
then it becomes a creative
project – finding what
feels the most true and
interesting and fruitful.
O: Definitely. And
things arose within that –
for example, Fleance, who
is traditionally Banquo’s
son, is now his daughter.
One of the prophecies is
that Banquo’s children
will be kings, and that’s
quite interesting, because
Fleance doesn’t know it
yet, but she’s going to be
queen. I really like that at
the end the fight still con-
tinues for power, between
genders and between
humans.
I: Moira’s not just pared
it down, she’s played
more of a functional
role. There are things in
the production, like the
stage directions, where
you can see what her in-
terpretation of the play is
and what she hopes ours
will be. Things that you
wouldn’t necessarily infer
from the original text. It’s
been really fun bringing
them out and staging them
in a way that’s true to the
original script but also
expresses Moira’s vision
of it.
O: I think it makes it
very rich. Hopefully as an
audience member you’re
shown not only the main
story but also the subtext,
which is brought to the
surface in flashes. There’s
so much I think you can
glean from it, which is
whyIthinkshe’s[Moira’s]
sprinkled certain extra
things around as well.
Q: Playing a female
Macbeth, what sort of
interpretation do you feel
you could bring to the role
that mightn’t be possible
with a more traditional
male Macbeth?
O: It’s really interest-
ing. I have to confess
that I’ve never seen
Macbeth played before,
so to answer that question
honestly I feel like I have
to tell you that first. But
what’s my interpretation?
It’s all from the text,
really – she’s so complex.
Yes, she’s a murderer,
we kind of refer to her
as almost psychopathic,
but she’s not. She feels
so deeply about her wife,
she’s married, she has to
work really hard at her
job to earn the status of
worthy warrior, Bellona’s
daughter, the goddess of
war – her work ethic’s

“At the end
the fight still
continues
for power,
between
genders and
between
humans”
really shown us that the
role isn’t limited to being
played by a man – but
rather playing the charac-
ter truthfully and bringing
the best to what is a very
interesting character. I
don’t know how useful
it is to look for female
stereotypes to crowbar
into that – I think seeing
Macbeth being played
by a woman is pure and
powerful in itself.
Q: So it’s not that
there’s anything particu-
larly different about a
female Macbeth, it’s just
Macbeth who happens
to be played by a female
actor.
O: Definitely. And it’s
been such an incredible
opportunity to have been
cast as Macbeth – to have
been cast as this utterly
complex, happy, sad,
tyrannical overthinker,
lover, whatever – it’s
really made me think. And
this isn’t anything new,
but what I hope it will
do for people watching
is to ask, why don’t other
women get the chance to
play complex characters
like this? I think it reveals
the spectrum of humanity,
or the spectrum of gender,
that you just don’t get to
see enough.
Q: Is there a huge
focus on gender in this
production, or is it just
a regular production of
Macbeth that happens to
be played by male and
female actors?
I: It’s a huge creative
decision to take a gen-
der-fluid approach, but
I don’t think it’s about
trying to make people read
certain things into it. Each
actor will know what their
gender is contributing to
their playing of the role,
but it’s not like we’ve
decided, for example, that
Queen Duncan should be
very effeminate. It’s very
deliberate, but it’s subtle.
O: Yes. I hope that
people will be able to
come and glean things
from the gender structure,
or whatever it is in this
production, themselves.
Which is actually, in my
opinion, much better.
I: There isn’t a specific
message we’re trying to
bring across by saying,
for example, Donalbain is
female. It’s about learning
what we can learn from
something which hasn’t
really been done before,
and it’s been a process of
discovery for us – finding
out along the way what
a female Macbeth might
mean. We’re still finding
stuff out.
Q: Genderswapped
or genderfluid casting is
quite popular nowadays.
Do you think there should
be a reason to deviate
from the genders the play-
wright has set out? Or do
you think casting should
just be more genderfluid,
and that anyone should
play whatever they want?
O: I don’t know. For me
it’s always case-by-case
– depending on what the
story is and how it could
be made more relevant by
opening up the gender.
I: Yeah, it depends on
the show so much. There
are certain things – and
people talk about this with
race as well – where if the
story is about a charac-
ter’s experience of having
a particular identity, then
obviously it’s a really
big decision to alter that.
I’m not going to say
hypothetically whether
that decision is right or
wrong, but, you know,
it’s one step to take. But
I think when it’s a story
about ambition, and love,
and what people will do to
get something – there’s no
reason why that shouldn’t
be explored in a differ-
ent way. In fact I think
there’s every reason why
it should be. And for me,
even just seeing casting
open up recently has
brought so much to plays
that I thought I knew well.
O: It’s theatre. You’re
telling a story, and you’re
taking people away from
their everyday lives and
making them believe that
Oseloka Obi as Macduff and Olivia Dowd as Macbeth // The Other Richard
great! She’s strong, but
she also loves her wife
and she’s ambitious. So
my interpretation is to
bring all those things
to the surface while
also allowing a kind of
softness. I don’t really
know what it’s like for
a man to play it but I
certainly know that our
[Macbeth and Lady
Macbeth’s] bond…
The end of the play,
“Tomorrow, tomorrow
and tomorrow…” is
really, really sad – and
yes, it’s nihilistic, but I
feel it. I can’t help but
feel that speech. And yes,
she stifles those feelings,
because she’s lost her
mind, she’s killed so
many people, she’s lost
her wife and she’s won-
dering what’s left. So my
interpretation is that she
feels these things.
Q: Does that tie in to
what you’ve said about
how girls have to stifle
emotions and appear very
outwardly strong or take
on masculine roles?
I: I can certainly see
some parallels to that, but
I feel that Macbeth is kind
of about that anyway.
When you see Macbeth
having all these second
thoughts and doubts and
forging ahead anyway,
that’s very human.
Staging Macbeth with
a female Macbeth, it’s
there’s a world on stage.
There are so many things
that we’re used to just
accepting, we could go
a bit quicker with telling
them in different ways.
With different people.
I: Like, these rules
are only necessary for as
long as they’re useful and
interesting, right?
