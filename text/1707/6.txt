O
ver the last
month there has
been significant
political turmoil
in Sri Lanka which kicked
off on the 26th October
when the President of Sri
Lanka, Sirisena, attempted
to sack Wickremesinghe,
the Prime Minister.
Sirisena has tried to re-
place him with Rajapaksa,
who was the sitting
President Sirisena ousted
in the 2015 Presidential
elections, highlighting
the strange nature of Sri
Lankan politics. Sirisena’s
campaign was built on
attacking Rajapaksa’s
regime for being corrupt
and built to serve his own
family before the rest of
the countrry.
The Prime Minister’s
and President’s respective
parties formed a working
coalition following Parlia-
mentary elections in 2015
which left no party with a
majority. In recent months
the relationship between
the two men has become
increasingly acrimonious
over issues ranging from
economic policy through
to accusations of assas-
sination plots against the
President. Despite these
grievances the sudden
attempted sacking of the
Prime Minister was a
shock decision. This has in
turn led to a constitutional
crisis in the country with
Wickremesinghe refusing
to go, claiming Sirisena
acted beyond the remit of
his constitutional powers.
There have been mass
protests on the streets
both for and against the
removal of Wickremesin-
ghe which turned deadly
when a protester was
shot dead by a member
of Wickremesinghe’s
security. There’s little
doubt that this has been
a co-ordinated power
grab by Sirisena and Ra-
japaksa, and the Supreme
Court has suspended the
decision pending full
court procedures begin-
ning on the 4th December.
Parliament’s role in this
saga has been vital. It was
thought that Sirisena made
this snap decision because
there was a majority in
Parliament to support Ra-
japaksa. When this looked
in doubt Sirisena proceed-
ed to suspend Parliament
to buy himself more time
to ensure that more MPs
could be convinced to
back Rajapaksa. Parlia-
ment has since recon-
vened, but Rajapaksa has
now lost 2 votes of con-
fidence, demonstrating
there is still no majority
for him. In all of this
Parliament has become a
mockery. Rival MPs have
physically attacked each
other, throwing books
and other items across the
Chamber and threatened
to attack the Speaker;
virtually blocking any
Parliamentary business
from taking place. Both
sets of MPs have also
boycotted Parliament in
protest at the situation.
Sirisena and Rajapaksa
have now attempted to
call for fresh elections
as a way of shifting the
Parliamentary arithmetic
in their favour.
For many the replace-
ment of Rajapaksa as
President in 2015 was
seen as a step forward for
Sri Lanka leaving behind
an era filled with sec-
tarian violence and war.
Rajapaksa defeated the
Tamil Tigers (a militant
organization) in 2009 but
in the process oversaw
numerous war crimes and
human rights violations
with anywhere between
9,000 and 40,000 civilians
dying in the final days of
the conflict. The Tamil
Tigers also committed
war crimes including tar-
geting civilians and child
conscription. The war
crimes committed by both
sides could and should
never be condoned. The
government at the time
and to do this day has
resisted any attempts
for an internationally
led investigation to take
place to look into what
happened. Rajapaksa was
seen as a hero to some for
ending the war but seen
as a murderer to others.
It was difficult to see how
he could bring about true
reconciliation between the
groups involved, and in
truth there were few signs
this was ever something
he was really interested in
as he stood on an overtly
nationalistic platform.
Sirisena was supported
the Tamil diaspora, many
of whom had not returned
to their home towns
and villages for decades
since they had left the
country during the civil
war. This was taken as an
opportunity to visit their
motherland and for some
re-establish roots in the
country. Sirisena’s gov-
ernment has clearly seen
in progress but has also
been disappointing. On
domestic policy Sirisena
had pledged a reform
program for the first 100
days of his Presidency.
However; significant parts
of his reform program
such as electoral reform
were never carried out
and he now claims not
to recognise the plans as
is his own at all. Further
investment is still needed
in areas of the country that
were worst affected by the
civil war to help them
develop and prosper.
It’s disappointing and
worrying to see Sirisena
attempt to thwart the
constitution and the rule
of law to appoint a man
who he has accused of
nepotism and corruption
as Prime Minister. The
crisis that has ensued has
left Parliament in paral-
ysis and the country in
turmoil with little hope of
a speedy resolution.
