War Horse: Theatre At Its Finest, Moving From First
Moment to Curtain Call.
Set in the French trenches during the First World War, Nick Stafford’s adaptation of Michael Morpurgo’s novel
dazzles both kids and parents alike.
M
y friends
always make
fun of me for
seeing cer-
tain plays multiple times.
There are some shows,
like Hamilton or Harry
Potter and the Cursed
Child (I know, contro-
versial), that as I leave
the theatre, I know that I
need to witness again to
truly appreciate. Well, let
me just say that, not only
did I see War Horse twice,
I saw it twice in a single
week.
Returning to National
Theatre eleven years
after its initial debut, to
commemorate the 100th
anniversary of Armistice
Day, War Horse explores
the bond between young
Albert and his beloved
horse Joey.
Adapted to stage from
MichaelMorpurgo’snovel
of the same name by Nick
Stafford, and directed by
Marianne Elliott and Tom
Morris, the play is unlike
anything I have seen on
stage before. The biggest
props, perhaps, goes out
to the Handspring Puppet
Company, though. From
the first moment Joey
appears on stage as a foal,
I had chills. Imagine my
disbelief the moment he
appears as a full-grown
horse moments later,
moving so realistically,
with so much personal-
ity, that I immediately
started crying. I cried
at how realistic a horse
puppet was. It was that
realistic. Throughout the
play, there’s this weird
awareness of the fact that
these ‘horses’ (yes, there
are multiple, and they are
all amazing, with individ-
ual personalities) are fake,
although within moments
you learn to suspend these
thoughts, convincing
yourself that these are real,
living animals on stage.
And with the intricacy
shown by the incredible
puppeteering company, it
really isn’t that hard to do
so.
“War Horse
explores the
bond between
young Albert
and his
beloved horse
Joey.”
“The war
scenes are
perfectly
executed,
with just the
right amount
of gruesome,
holding a
mirror to the
ugly realities
of warfare.”
Horses are not the only
animal puppets in the play.
The decision to include
birds here and there add
a wonderful touch of
nature, and the goose acts
as a much-needed comic
relief, that never takes
away from the serious
tone of the play.
The play is magnifi-
cently paced; there’s never
really a dull moment as
the characters (human and
puppet) are continuously
thrown new obstacles to
overcome. Not only do
these build up in terms
of intensity throughout
the play, putting more at
stakes for the characters,
they also allow for a hefty
amount of foreshadowing,
and subtle call-backs to
previous events.
The war scenes are
perfectly executed, with
just the right amount
of gruesome, holding a
mirror to the ugly realities
of warfare. These scenes
are loud and intense and
had me at the edge of my
seat.
The acting is also great,
with a special shout-out
to Thomas Dennis, who
really manages to portray
Albert’s youth and inno-
cence beautifully, and Jo
Castleton, who delivers
an emotionally packed
performance as Albert’s
mother, Rose Naracott.
Without giving too much
away, Rose’s reactions
and feelings towards
certain events in the play
are perhaps the most
gut-wrenching of all.
Although not a musical,
there is bits of singing dis-
persed through the show.
At first, I wasn’t fully sold
on these, as I wasn’t sure
what they really added,
but by the interval, I was
on board. They still don’t
feel like an integral part of
the play, but I did enjoy
the commentary they
provided. Additionally,
I think they also helped
pace the play, dispersing
and adding tension as
needed.
Overall, if I was to sum
up the play with a single
word, it would be mag-
netising. The play moved
me deeply from the first
moment until its last, and
I wept like a baby. War
Horse is a combination
of everything I love about
theatre, and each aspect is
expertly curated to work
like magic. Morpurgo’s
novel might be widely
classified as a children’s
novel, although on stage,
War Horse is not only a
play suitable for everyone,
tt is a play that should be
seen by everyone (above
the age of 10, according
to National Theatre).
So deeply moving and
effective, the play stays
with the viewer long
after leaving the theatre.
If there is a single play I
would recommend anyone
to see this year in London,
it would undoubtedly be
War Horse. Playing at
National Theatre until
January 2019, War Horse
is a not-to-be-missed
visual and emotional
spectacle that any theatre
enthusiast should get to
witness.
