Sachs was
sued by the US
Securities and Exchange
Commission over alle-
gations that it had misled
clients over the mortgage
backed securities it had
sold. Internal Goldman
emails surfaced showing
how arrogant self-interest
bankers had left their
clients out in the cold to
save their jobs and the
cost to the Wall Street
bank. However, Goldman
soon recovered as the
then chief executive
Lloyd Blankfein paid
$550m to settle the alle-
gations, launching a top
to bottom cultural review
and spending 18 months
visiting clients to reassure
them that Goldman has
received the message
on ethics and will in the
future put clients’interests
first. Despite this, at the
beginning of the month
the US Department of
Justice revealed that two
former senior Goldman
bankers had been charged
with money laundering
in connection with the
Malaysian state invest-
ment fund 1MDB, in
what is alleged as one
of the biggest frauds of
image of the country, it’s
a cost to investments, and
it’s now a burden shoul-
dered by the government
because of the complexity
of so many of these so-
called credible, renowned
financial institutions”.
Goldman refused to
comment of Mr Anwar’s
comments. Goldman
had previously insisted it
had no knowledge of the
fraudulent activity, but
it has now surfaced that
Lloyd Blankfein met with
Jho Low, the man at the
heart of the scandal, at the
banks New York head-
quarters during a meeting
with the CEO of Aabar,
an Abu Dhabi investment
fund. It has emerged that
the Abu Dhabi investment
fund has filed a lawsuit
in New York, claiming
that Goldman bribed
Mohammed al-Husseiny,
chief executive of Aabar,
to make them act against
the funds interests as
part of “a massive, in-
ternational conspiracy
to embezzle billions of
dollars” from 1MBD. It
is then no surprise that
Goldman’s image has
taken a significant hit in
Southeast Asia, taking
17th spot for fees as of the
start of November, as the
Malaysian ruling coalition
faces up to $10bn in debt
repayments linked to the
1MBD scandal in time
when it is grappling with
a weak fiscal position,
having revised the 2018
fiscal deficit from 2.8% to
3.7% in the latest budget
issued in early November.
Goldman could
perhaps recover if it was
an isolated incident,

all time. The purpose of
the fund set up by Najib
Razak, Malaysia’s Prime
Minister in 2009, was to
promote economic devel-
opment. According to the
Department of Justice,
at least $3.5 billion was
stolen from this fund and
had found its way into
the hands of Najib and
many of his associates,
to help in the purchase
of a luxury apartment in
Manhattan, a corporate
jet, and ironically even
helped finance the movie
The Wolf of Wall Street.
Goldman enters the pic-
ture 10 years ago, when it
aimed to target Southeast
Asia as part of its regional
expansion. The bank
built relationships with
Malaysian tycoons and
the government of Najib
Razak. Consequently,
state run 1MBD hired
Goldman to work on
$6.5bn in bond deals
that reeled in $600m in
fees, an unusually high
rate for the service. Now
Anwar Ibrahim, the likely
future prime minister,
has condemned Goldman
Sachs’ role in the scandal
as “disgusting” and has
demanded that the bank
should return significantly
more than the $600m the
banks were paid, due to the
fact that “it’s a cost to the

however, on Wednesday
South Korea’s financial
regulator imposed a
$6.7m fine on the bank for
conducting a type of short
selling that is banned in
the country. The question
Goldman must be asking
themselves now is
whether this new scandal
threatens to undermine
Goldman’s claims to be
cleaner and more ethical,
and whether its leaders
have lost control of their
empire amid their pursuit
of growth.
