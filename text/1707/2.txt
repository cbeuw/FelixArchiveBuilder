A promising answer
to historical student
feedback on lack of
space in the Central
Library
Alejandro Luy
Deputy President
(Education)
T
he Central Li-
brary is piloting
a Study Break
Card scheme
for two weeks beginning
Monday 3rd
December.
The scheme is a direct
response to the feedback
from library users, via
mediums such as the
National Student Survey,
Student Experience
Survey and Library
surveys, which prompted
Library Services to inves-
tigate ways to allow users
fairer access to study
space.
One of the recurring
themes in feedback
received relating to the
London university students help blood cancer charity,
Anthony Nolan, celebrate 20 years of lifesaving
B
lood cancer
charity, Antho-
ny Nolan, cele-
brates 20 years
of its student volunteer
network, "Marrow".
Imperial is amongst ten
London universities with
a Marrow society and,
over the last 20 years, Im-
perial Marrow has joined
other Marrow socieities in
holding over 400 events
to raise awareness of the
work that Anthony Nolan
does to support families
and patients with blood
cancer. Over 90 students
recruited through these
Marrow events have gone
on to donate stem cells.
As part of a year-long
celebration to raise aware-
ness of the need for more
stem cell donors, Marrow
groups will be holding a
series of fundraising and
donor recruitment events.
Charlotte Cunliffe,
Marrow Programme
Lead, said, "This year,
our wonderful Marrow
community is proud to
be celebrating 20 years
of saving lives. Our work
in universities is vital,
because it allows us to
reach a young and diverse
group of people. We are
excited about the next
20 years and are looking
forward to spreading the
word about the lifesaving
potential of students on
campuses across London."
Patients from black,
Asian or other minority
ethnic backgrounds have
just a 20% chance of
finding a matching stem
cell donor, compared to
69% of patients from north
European backgrounds.
As such, Marrow students
aim to recruit potential
donors from a range of
backgrounds.
With more than 1500
people recruited by
student volunteers having
gone on to donate their
stem cells, Marrow has
gone from strength to
strength and continues
to work hard to save the
lives of people with blood
cancer.

library is how difficult it
can be at busy times of
the year for users to find
a place to study. Based
on the feedback, one
key cause of this issue is
that some library users
leave their belongings to
‘reserve’ a space – some-
times for hours at a time.
This causes dissatisfaction
among those trying to find
a study space, and is not
an effective or fair use of
the limited space available
in the library.
A Study Break Card
scheme was chosen as
a solution by looking to
similar schemes success-
fully implemented at other
university libraries.
Introducing study break
cards during the busiest
periods – close to exam
and assessment dates –
will lead to more library
users being able to find a
space when they need to
study, leading to a more
effective use of the space
available.
The scheme also
encourages users to take
regular breaks from
studying which is positive
for wellbeing and will
hopefully lead to health-
ier studying habits. The
scheme allows users to
take breaks of up to 30
minutes without forfeiting
the study space they are
using by simply filling out
a card and leaving it on
the desk they are using.
Users wishing to leave
for over 30 minutes, for
example to attend classes,
will be expected to clear
the space they have been
using and take their be-
longings with them.
30 minutes. The success
of the scheme hinges on
whether or not library
users respect the cards and
each other’s belongings,
and library staff will be
monitoring for any abuse
of the scheme during the
pilot.
Feedback on the
scheme is essential to
make sure that it meets
the needs of Library users
– so please provide feed-
back to the library using
ASK the Library https://
imperial.service-now.
com/ask or by emailing
library@imperial.ac.uk.
There are also paper feed-
back forms available and
friendly staff to chat to at
the Information Hub on
level 1 of the Library.
Cards will be available
from card dispensers on
all levels of the Central
Library and at the Infor-
mation Hub. Of course,
please remember to never
leave any valuables unat-
tended at any time in the
library.

The calm before the storm
T
his evening
I received an
e-mail from the
printer. The email
read, "we will need your
pages here much earlier
than they were last week
please."
The jig is up. The not-
so-firm print deadline that
I've enjoyed and exploited
all term is starting to
tighten up.
Having said that, it's
11.21pm and I'm only
now writing this. So we
might not have a paper this
week, depending on if the
printers refuse to put up
with my shit any longer.
Who knows, they may
even be like the College
and cap it at 40%?
I've also just realised
I haven't had the time
to change my editorial
picture. One day, my
friends, one day. Or is it
too late to even bother?
I'm starting to thing this
is becoming kinda like my
brand.
This week's Felix goes
lite, with only 32 pages.
I see this as the calm
before the storm because
next week's issue, which
is the final issue of term,
is certain to be a thicc
boi. Coming soon to a
common room near you.
Funny how so many
people told me, "it gets
easier after Imperial".
because this literal 11th
hour adrenaline rush feels
very familiar. At least this
time I don't get kicked out
of the building. And I get
to control the temperature
in the office (perks of the
job).
We've got some great
pieces in the paper this
week. With almost a full
term gone, we've heard
from staff and students
based in White City on
how they've found it so
2
far. Some interesting
opinions and perspectives
were shared.
There's also a comment
piece from Lasith reflect-
ing on his experience of
the Boxing Day Tsunami
almost 14 years ago,
in Galle, Sri Lanka. A
definite must-read.
Asalways,Icouldn'tget
any of this done without
the great work of the Felix
team. Speaking of who,
we took over ACC this
week (hyberbole? Yes,
but who cares). The next
few weeks are shaping up
to be very social-heavy in
the Felix office is getting
into the festive spirit . If
any of you are interested
in joining in a great (and
wholesome) group of
people, let us know! We're
always happy to have new
faces join.
Props once again to the
Section of the Week: Arts!
You guys are starting to
scare me a bit with this
level of efficiency. Like
wow. The rest of you lot
- step your game up.
(also shoutout to my
ghostwriter for this ed-
itorial, who still doesn't
get as much credit as they
deserve. If only they put
as much effort into their
degree as they did with
this paper)
“I could
probably write
this editorial
without
shameless pull
quotes, but
why would i
want to?”
“Introducing
study break
cards during
the busiest
periods - close
to exam and

dates - will
lead to more
library users
being able to
find a space
when they

“The
scheme also
encourages
users to take
regular breaks
from studying,
which is
positive for
wellbeing
and will
hopefully lead
to healthier
studying
habits”
The scheme will expect
users to carefully, and
respectfully, move be-
longings aside and use the
study space if it has been
left unattended for over
