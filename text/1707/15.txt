Felix Reviews: Deltarune Chapter 1
Games

I
t has been three
long years since
the release of the
RPG wonder that
was Undertale. With its
interesting gameplay me-
chanics, outstanding OST
and plethora of brilliant
characters, it’s hard to
believe that its creator,
Toby Fox, could possibly
top it. I can just about
say that Deltarune has
the potential to surpass
its predecessor, with an
inventive combat system,
new well fleshed out
characters and spectacular
OST that is arguably
better than the first game.
The reason that I say
‘potential’ is because only
only one chapter of the
game has been released
thus far; without a com-
plete story it cannot truly
be compared to the source
material. Nonetheless the
game retains some of the
qualities and characters
of the previous game (for
example Temmie, who
returns with a good supply
of poorly constructed
sentences) whilst putting
a twist on the game with
it being set in a different
universe from Undertale.
Story:
Right from the opening
character customisation,
Deltarune retains all the
charm and personality
many of us grew to love
in Undertale--a mixture
of comedy, philosophy
and nihilism that we can
all appreciate. As well as
plenty more satirisation
of the RPG genre, with
certain points in the game
bluntly reminding you of
the linear nature of the
genre as a whole and the
expectations that lies with
it. This sort of whismy is
carried out throughout the
entire game with moments
of bluntness to silliness
to borderline tears for
how sweet the characters
can be. Compared to the
stale dialogue and arc
that RPG’s usually have,
Deltarune managed to
keep me invested in its
characters. Following
your atypical Earthbound
style RPG, the game starts
off in a suburban town,
complete with iconic
undertale characters. Just
like its predecessor, you
find yourself in a similar
body to the previous
protagonist, with just as
much of a talkative per-
sonality as you navigate
the town whilst seeing
characters of the previous
game in different sideline
roles. However, this
doesn’t last for long as the
game abruptly transitions
into a different world.
Along with your ultra-vi-
olent classroom bully
Susie, you encounter the
lovable pushover Ralsei,
who informs you of the
prophecy about their
combined forces being
needed to save the world.
Trying my best not to spoil
the treasure trove that is
the story, the game con-
tinues with the characters
defeating enemies with
either kindness or a blood
fuelled rampage, with
plenty of laughs, fun and
soul eating heartbreak.
The game is ruthless when
it comes to hitting you
right in the feels.
Gameplay:
Taking the gameplay
style of Undertale,
Deltarune improves
upon it by including a
party system in which
characters can each carry
out one of the following
actions: attack, act, item,
spare, defend. Striking
the same vein as final
fantasy, characters are
situated on the left hand
side with enemies on the
right in a turn based fight.
Attacks can be avoided
with the previous game’s
mechanic of the player
moving the heart to dodge
them. The player also has
the ability to carry out the
classic act of sparing, but
they also now have the
ability to use pacifist or
non-pacifists actions, in
which the theme of good
and bad is made abun-
dantly clear. The actions
themselves are unique to
each character with some
going the pacifist route
and others not so much.
Similar to a standard RPG,
one of the characters is
a mage who is capable
of using spells, provided
the player has generated
enough of the TP metre
(essentially mana points)
from avoiding attacks or
defending. With plenty
of laughs and gags inbuilt
into the combat, it’s a nice
change of pace from the
usual RPG monotony and
seriousness.
The Verdict:
Under the humongous
pressure of living up to
Undertale’s reputation,
Deltarune does a fantastic
job of building on the
material from the last
game whilst providing
new and original content.
I struggle to find any fault
with the game given that it
lives up to every standard
set by the previous game,
with fantastic characters,
OST, gameplay, and
overall fantastic story arc
that leaves you enamored
by its universe. And that’s
not even mentioning
the spectacle that is the
slapstick humour of the
game that makes you ap-
preciate that much more.
My only possible critique
of the game is that I want
the next chapter to come
out ASAP, I want to
experience more Lancer
wholesomeness as well as
the return of ‘that face’ he
makes!
Another fantastic addition to the series. Toby Fox yet again hits gold with a game set in a different version of the
Undertale universe that brings everything you loved from the first game and so much more!
