Poorest dying nearly ten years younger than the rich in
“deeply worrying” trend for UK health

T
he gap between
the life expectan-
cy of the richest
and poorest sec-
tors of society in England
is increasing, according
to new research from
Imperial College London.
The study, which was
published in the journal
Lancet Public Health and
funded by the Wellcome
Trust, analysed Office for
National Statistics data
on all deaths recorded in
England between 2001
and 2016 – 7.65 million
deaths in total.
From this data, it was
found that in 2016 the
life expectancy of women
in the most deprived
communities was 78.8
years, compared to 86.7
years in the most affluent
group. For men, the life
expectancy was 74.0
years among the poorest,
compared to 83.8 years
among the richest.
They also revealed that
the life expectancy of
England’s poorest women
has fallen by 0.24 years
since 2011, in what re-
searchers say is a “deeply
worrying” trend.
Equally shocking was
that the life expectancy
gap between the most
affluent and most deprived
sectors of society has
actually increased since
the turn of the century,
from 6.1 years in 2001
to 7.9 years in 2016 for
women, and from 9.0 to
9.7 years in men.
The team conducted
their analysis by using
information on where
each death occurred,
which was matched to
small areas of England
known as lower super
output areas by the Office
of National Statistics.
These lower super output
areas, which each have
a population of around
1,500 people, are given a
score of deprivation from
the Office of National
Statistics (called an Index
of Multiple Deprivation).
The research team point
out this means the com-
parisons are based on a
community’s deprivation
and affluence, and not that
of individuals.
Professor Majid Ezzati,
senior author of the
research from Imperial’s
School of Public Health,
said: “Falling life ex-
pectancy in the poorest
communities is a deeply
worrying indicator of
the state of our nation’s
health, and shows that
we are leaving the most
vulnerable out of the col-
lective gain.
“We currently have a
perfect storm of factors
that can impact on health,
and that are leading
to poor people dying
younger. Working income
has stagnated and benefits
have been cut, forcing
many working families
to use food banks. The
price of healthy foods like
fresh fruit and vegetables
has increased relative
to unhealthy, processed
food, putting them out of
the reach of the poorest.”
He added: “The
funding squeeze for
health and cuts to local
government services
since 2010 have also
had a significant impact
on the most deprived
communities, leading to
treatable diseases such as
cancer being diagnosed
too late, or people dying
sooner from conditions
like dementia.”
The research team also
analysed the illnesses
that contributed to the
widening life expectancy
gap. Although they found
that people in the poorest
sectors died at a higher
rate from all illnesses,
a number of diseases
showed a particularly
stark difference between
rich and poor.
The diseases that led
to particularly large loss
of longevity in the poor
compared to the rich
were newborn deaths
and children’s diseases,
respiratory diseases, heart
disease, lung and digestive
cancers, and dementias. In
2016, children under five
years old from the poorest
sectors of society were
2.5 times as likely to die
as children from affluent
families.
“This study suggests
the poor in England are
dying from diseases that
can be prevented and
treated,” said Professor
Ezzati. “Greater invest-
ment in health and social
care in the most deprived
areas will help reverse the
worrying trends seen in
our work. We also need
government and industry
action to eradicate food
insecurity and make
healthy food choices
more affordable, so that
the quality of a family’s
diet isn’t dictated by their
income.”
