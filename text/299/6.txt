The new LP by Judy Col-
lins, "Whales and Nightin-
gales" (Elektra) has just
been released in this country
after several weeks of avail-
ability on the import mar-
ket. Some of the 13 tracks
are reminiscent of her earlier
record "Wildflowers", in
particular the two Jacques
Brel songs and Judy's own
contribution "Nightingale",
a simple but haunting
melody in the same vein as
earlier tracks such as "Since
you Asked", also arranged
by Joshua Rifkin. Tributes
to Dylan (Time Passes
Slowly) and Baez (Song for
David) are included, but the
most unusual tracks are
those without instrumental
accompaniment. "Amazing
Grace" is well known, and
there is also "Farewell to
Tarwathie" with its back-
ground choir of humpback
whales! A good idea bril-
liantly carried out. Perhaps
the best track is Dominic
Behan's "Patriot Game"
framed by the lonely sound
of a squeeze-box. The song,
which is rather topical at the
moment, is set to the tune
which Bob Dylan borrowed
for "With God on our Side".
Also of note is "Nightingale
II", an orchestral variation
by Joshua Rifkin on the
basic tune of "Nightingale
I".
Not completely unlike the
music of Judy Collins is
that of Pentangle, Whose LP
"Cruel Sister" (Transatlan-
tic) was issued a couple of
months ago. On this record
the group have devoted
themselves entirely to the
interpretation of traditional
English music. One side is
wholly devoted to a 17-
minute version of the ballad
"Jack Orion" which also ap-
peared a few year ago as the
title track of a Bert Jansch
LP. Four of the 17 minutes
are occupied by a Terry
Cox dulcitone solo and a
superb electric guitar solo
from John Renbourn. A l -
though the group apparently
worked on this song for
eleven months, it appears to
me to be of indifferent re-
cording quality, particularly
the balancing of Jacqui
McShee's voice.
One of Pentangle's wea-
ker points is excessive im-
provisation and loose play-
ing, but there is one track on
this record — "Lord Frank-
lin'' — where this problem
is nowhere in sight. Ren-
bourn sings in his sad, frac-
tured voice, accompanied by
himself on both acoustic and
electric guitar, Bert Jansch
playing chords on concertina,
and Jacqui's voice wafting
around in the background.
Perfection. Coincidentally,
the tune is also one which
Dylan borrowed, for "Bob
Dylan's Dream". The LP
also includes an unaccom-
panied item from Jacqui,
which compares very favour-
ably with those of Judy Col-
lins, although without the
gimmicks.
The title track, on which
everyone joins in the fa-la-la
refrain, includes a sitar in
the backing — a weird fusion
of two national traditions,
which again is not one of
the best engineered record-
ings 1 have heard. Few Bri-
tish producers seem to cap-
ture the stereo clarity
achieved by their American
equivalents.
One exception, however,
is the work of Peter Vince,
engineer of the new record
"Marvin, Welch and Farrar"
(Regal-Zonophone). When
required, he is able to pro-
duce crystal clear and
separate sounds from each
instrument. Listening to this
record reveals different musi-
cal styles no doubt attribut-
able to different members of
the group. The two tracks
on which Bruce Welch takes
the lead vocal, including the
single "Faithful", are re-
strained masterpieces, whilst
several others, obviously in-
fluenced by Hank Marvin,
hark back to the earlier ef-
forts of the Shadows. There
is, however, an added ele-
ment of social comment,
particularly evident in "Sil-
very Rain" which concerns
the extinction of insects and
birds by insecticides, and
"Mister Sun", an anti-war
song.
The oscillation between
smooth lyrical songs and rock
numbers, together with the
guitar work and the occa-
sional sound effects appear-
ing in the far distance, re-
minds me strongly of Simon
and Garfunkel's famous
"Bridge" album. John Far-
rar contributes some excel-
lent string arrangements but
spoils a couple of the tracks
by attempting to sing like
the Righteous Brothers. Per-
haps surprisingly, the record
contains no instrumentals.

CATCH
Following much in the
same vein as " M A S H "
comes "CATCH 22" now
showing at the Chelsea
Essoldo. Directed by Mike
Nicols — of "The Graduate"
fame — the film is an ac-
curate adaptation of the
book by Joseph Heller. An
anti-war epic it is set in the
Mediterranean towards the
end of the Second World
War. Yossarian (played by
Alan Arkin) is a captain in
a bomber squadron endeav-
ouring to get himself re-
lieved from operations. To
do this he must prove him-
self crazy but there is a
catch. How can he be crazy
if he is sane enough to want
to be grounded? Catch 22.
The film is an incredible
sequence of flashbacks and
hallucinatory visions, mak-
ing the prior reading of the
book almost a necessity.
The fantasies are centred
around Yossarian's horrific
experience with a dying
young English pilot, Snow-
den, returning from a bomb-
ing mission. And here lies
the film's power as an anti-
war film: just when we think
we understand the horror of
Snowden's death, Nicols
shocks us with a bloody
moment strong enough to
shake anybody complacent
about war. Because "Catch
22" does not show any actual
scenes of war it does not
fall into the trap, common
to many anti-war films, of
accidently picturing war as
glamorous or exciting.
Some of the madness of
the book is captured by
Jon Voight's portrayal of
Milo Minderbinder — a
parody of the all-American
whealer-dealer. On cornering
the whole Egyptian market in
cotton Milo finds he is unable
to set rid of the stuff and
M I K E Y A T E S
after an unsuccessful plan to
get the troops to eat the cot-
ton covered in chocolate —
real cotton candy — he
makes a deal with the Ger-
mans to take it off his hands
in return for letting them
bomb the American base.
Unlike many epics, some
of the expense that went
into "Catch 22" (15m dol-
lars) does appear on film —
the all star cast and magni-
ficent sets, in particular
those showing the bomber
squadron of some 20 to 30
planes taking to the air in a
most ungainly and eerie
fashion. One of the overall
impressions of the film is the
beauty of the photography.
The introductory credits are
shown over a backcloth of a
slightly speeded up film of
the sun rising over the dis-
tant mountains to utter
silence.
A special Wellsoc presen-
tation in the Great Hall last
Tuesday was a talk by Dr.
R. A. Moog on the subject of
his famous synthesiser. The
purpose of this machine is to
allow the composer to
create any audio waveform,
modify it by means of filters,
and arrange sounds in se-
quence if required. Thus he
can either reproduce tradi-
tional instruments or make
MOOG
original sounds of his own.
The original synthesiser was
designed purely for the man
working in a studio making
music on tape, but we were
also shown a smaller version
intended for live performan-
ces.
After a historical preample,
Dr. Moog gave us a thorough
demonstration of his brain-
child's capabilities, although
he could not actually create
any music, since he had not
brought a multi-track re-
corder. He did, however,
conclude his lecture by play-
ing us tapes of various ex-
amples of lighter electronic
music.
This music is said to be a
minority taste, but having
seen the size of the audience,
I cannot agree. By the way,
Moog rhymes with Vogue.
