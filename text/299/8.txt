The USK grants campaign
has been successful in getting
local newspaper coverage.
The Kensington Post, West
London Observer and Ful-
ham Chronicle have featured
our press release, but didn't
come to the USK write-in last
Wednesday. Nationally the
Times Education supplement
has given grants the most
prominence and the Evening
Standard has carried the
occasional story on rising
rents and costs.
Madame Ngyen Ngok
Zung one of the NLF's dele-
gates from the PARIS peace
talks will be speaking at a
major meeting on Vietnam at
IC, Monday, 1st March. The
event is one of a series organ-
ised by the movement for
Colonial freedom (liberation)
to re-awaken attention to the
situation in South East Asia.
The Exploration Society
will be holding the following
lectures in March in an
attempt to draw attention to
exploration facilities in I.C.:
March 2nd — I.C. Expedi-
tions in Iran and Iceland
(colour slides) Min Tech
303 5.30.
March 16th—Keith Miller
on the Greenland Expe-
dition Min Tech 303
5.30.
March 23rd—John Woods
—Underwater expert.
General Studies, 1.30
Mech Eng.
Coffee and biscuits will be
served free of charge after-
wards. It is hoped that any-
one interested in having an
Exploration Society in I.C.
(especially 1st and 2nd years)
will attend.
A return visit from Wom-
en's Lib the Monday before
last, accompanied by Gay
Lib, to invade the Union bar.
As if trying to prove their
case, the Physics 3 bar clique
chucked them out. Later the
same group clashed with the
visitors in South Side bar.
Still later a black maria
cruised back and forth out-
side South Side, but left on
finding no disturbance still in
evidence.
Hat-trick for Mr. Dennis
Taylor, who has been arrested
three times—total fines now
amount to £3.75. Well done
Dennis!

Department of Physics.
16 Feb., 1971.
Dear Sir,
Now the biggest joke that
the Physics Dept. I.C. has
heard, has reached the front
page of Sennet, 16-2-71, we
feel that it is time the TRUE
facts of the incident were
told. We are referring to the
incident in which Ricardo
Turulloes, P.G., was dragged
to Kensington Gardens and
thrown into the Round Pond.
The incident began on the
Tuesday before, when some
third year students were told
by a P.G., that the third year
study room had been given to
the P.G.'s to work in. That
night Dr. Pain was asked to
clarify the position concern-
ing the room. A second meet-
ing was held with Dr. Pain
on the Thursday morning, in
which he told us that the
room was still a third year
study room although a few
P.G.'s had been given per-
mission to work in there.
On Friday afternoon,
Ricardo had called a basis
group meeting in the third
year study room. However
when he got there, he found
five third year students work-
ing. Regardless, he talked to
his followers, and when
asked to be quiet he replied
that he had been given per-
mission to work there and
holding the meeting was his
work. After repeated de-
mands for quiet, a heated
argument started, during
which more third year stu-
dents came into the room.
They are accused of being
'strong men', but few who
knew who were in the room
would say that. The argu-
ment came to a head with a
final demand for silence, and
an offer for both sides to go
to the head of the depart-
ment to clarify whether poli-
tical activity meant work.
The answer was 'Why should
I go to him, let him come to
me'. The third year students
decided that there was only
one course left open to them
to protect their study room,
and that was to eject Ricar-
do. There was no violence as
Ricardo had the sense to
realise that it was to no pur-
pose, so he walked quiety i.e.
not struggling, to Kensington
Gardens, whereupon he ran
into the Round Pond, up to
his knees in water, to avoid
being thrown in. He splashed
the third year students who
stood around laughing, and
then they returned to college.
These are the facts of what
happened on that Friday
afternoon.
Although Ricardo admit-
ted that the incident was
childish, the police were
called in to investigate Dr.
Pain's part in it. Whether
Dr. Pain did or did not offer
a barrel of beer is irrelevant,
the third year students would
have done exactly the same
thing in the situation as it
was. Dr. Pain did not contact
us, we contacted him about
the study room, and if fingers
are being pointed at people
inciting violence, we suggest
that it was Ricardo who pro-
voked action against himself
by his attitudes in the study
room.
Yours truly,
Nicholas Riley
John Prince
It finished about 3 months
ago now, and with the excep-
tion of 3 or 4 cheques we
have the final balance sheet:
Altogether collected —
£1019.87 (with just another
£25.95 owing). After costs
of about £40 this means a
£1000 profit for Carnival.
Thus having reached our
four-figure target I'd now
like to thank again all the
walkers and all the people
who helped before, on and
after the night, especially
D.T., Rob, Rob, Pete, Gregg
and Janet Turk—THANKS
A THOUSAND!
Who collected the most?
1 (Our £10 prize winner):
D. Law, Mech Eng 2:
£134.621.
2 J. E. Lumby, Maths 2 :
£37.16.
3 N . Patele, Met 1: £27.40.
Ta for the last time,
Mclooge.
Ombudsbox
Tomorrow (or today — de-
pending on when you're read-
ing this Felix), situated at
lunchtime in the J.C.R.,
Southside Entrance and the
Union Entrance, you will
find an Ombudsbox and an
Infobox, manned mainly by
your floor reps.
As an extension of a
scheme initiated successfully
elsewhere, we are trying a
new approach to the thorny
old problem of closing the
gap between the ordinary
Union member and Council
and I.C. in general.
If he doesn't pester you
personally, go and find out
what's happening—this is a
chance for you to question
Council, put forward your
views or ask for answers.
For at least one day this
year we Council bureaucrats
are making an attempt to
reach the Union floor—would
you like this to be done more
permanently? PLEASE BE-
SIEGE US !
