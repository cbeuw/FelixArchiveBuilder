Carnival Week began at
midnight on Friday, 12th
Feb. at the Lyceum, and
ended on Saturday with the
incredible fete opened by the
equally impressive Miss Julie
Ege.
The Lyceum all-nighter
was attended by an appreci-
ative audience of around
1600. Considering the ex-
cellent entertainment for
15/-, it was surprisingly (or
typically) supported by only
100 or so people from I.C.
Anyway it made £1,100, of
which Carnival received
10 per cent.
Saturday morning saw
tiddleywinks No 2 which
turned out 60 enthusiastic
winkers and a gorilla, all of
whom proceeded along the
new underground section of
the course from Marble Arch
to Bond Street, finishing with
carol-singing in Piccadilly
Circus and an attempted
break-in to Emperor Rosko's
live Radio 1 show in Lower
Regent Street.
If this wasn't enough for
any masochist, the Carnival
XI and a gorilla turned out
on Sunday to play football
against the Thighs XI. The
final score, 7-2 for Thighs,
was not surprising consider-
ing that half the Carnival
team joined forces with the
Thighs at half-time. An ex-
haustive match which was
finished early due to a fas-
cist gardener from Hyde
Park telling us to b. off and
this was followed by a mini-
invasion of Speakers' Corner
where the gorilla more than
made his presence kown.
Multi-farious events oc-
curred, not least the contro-
versial tube collection, so
highly praised by the public
that 89 letters of congratula-
tion were handed in at Char-
ing Cross. . .
F i t z r o y
Tavern in Tottenham Court
Road for a few small beers;
the proprietor seemed un-
concerned until the "unex-
pected" timely arrivel of the
Rugby Club en masse from
U.C., when he finally called
the police to clear the pre-
mises at half past ten.
The two barrels left ruined
any hope of sponsorship, as
did the Met Police who cun-
ningly built a police station
not a hundred yards away.
A quiet Thursday gave
way to the Carnival Revue
with full supporting artist(e)s,
and a self-supporting strip-
per, delighted us all with her
tit-illating smiles.

THE END was in sight on
Saturday with Miss Julie
Ege-without-the-'D' opening
the Carnival fete half-an-
hour late due to her being
waylaid in Linstead Hall
bar. Having cost nothing
and done everything, she
was "tailor-made" for the
occasion, and brought a fit-
ting end to a Carnival Week
which has apparently made
about £800, bringing the
Carnival total to date to
about £3,300.

Mike Migrates!
And so on till the attempt
to drink a pub dry on Wed-
nesday morning/afternoon/
evening when 100 revellers
turned out to the Fitzroy
Only a few weeks after the
installation of I.C.'s mascot
on its plinth, the 4ft. micro-
meter "Mike", has been
stolen, and the plinth in the
Union lower Lounge left
smashed, presumably by
students from another Col-
lege.
Mike's theft was discover-
ed by the Security Guards at
5.40 a.m. last Friday morn-
ing. Maria, the plinth, had
been raped with crowbars
and chisels, and Mike had
been torn out from its plinth,
complete with clamp assem-
bly. No clues or messages
were left at the scene,
though a large cold chisel
was found on the floor.
The raiders appeared to
have entered from third floor
Old Beit Hall, where the
link door (fire escape) is not
lockable. Two windows
from the former S.C.R. on-
to the roof at street level be-
hind the Union building had
been forced to allow an easy
getaway.
When asked to explain how
its supposedly unbeatable
alarm system had failed to
go off, WHO (the Wooden
Horse Organisation) said
that not all the alarms had
been installed, due to per-
son or persons unknown
pushing their Araldite into
Maria's locks some time
ago. In any case, no alarms
were envisaged to detect
smashing of the plinth, as
such a circumstance had
never been considered. The
plinth had always been be-
lieved to be unsmashable (it
was built by I.C. mainten-
ance some years ago, and be-
fore any of the present
members of WHO were at
I.C.) Moreover, the letter
of challenge sent out to the
other Colleges in 1966, when
Mike was first installed, had
specified that the plinth was
inviolate.
At the time of going to
press, no clues had been re-
ceived as to who had stolen
Mike, and so no attempts
have yet been made to re-
cover him. However, when
the need arises, WHO will
need more members—apply
via the Union letter rack
('W'). In the meantime, I.C.
carpenters have constructed
a strong wooden chastity
box to protect Maria from
further violation, and to
hide from the Public the re-
mains of her shattered virtue.
