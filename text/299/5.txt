Perhaps because of its
youth, Essex university seems
to lack a collective personal-
ity or character. The London
School of Economics has its
extremists, its cramped
streets and buildings; IC has
its union bar and spread-
eagled campus. Essex lacks
nothing in facilities or in its
students, or come to that
even in its bad publicity. But
maybe the latter, unique in
the amount of fame it can
bring a college, has dropped
recently. Critics find it harder
to apply the generalisations
that were once applied about
drugs, anarchy and "dossers".
The university was built
spanning a valley in green
but windswept Essex country-
side. Nearby are the artifi-
cial lakes whose only con-
The Hexagon restaurant
Vice-chancellor's house
cessions to artificiality are
their near perfect geometri-
cal shapes. Above the lakes
and on the road to the quay-
side village of the same
name, is 19th century Wiven-
hoe house. It could be the
setting of a country club but
combines facilities for stu-
dents with the quiet of a
country house. The architec-
ture of the university itself
is too various to describe
here, but the towers (bot-
tom) have a special unique-
ness. In these 14-storey "pil-
lars", students live in flats
(1 per storey), largely inde-
pendent of university super-
vision. The scheme appears
to work well and more tow-
ers are being built when fin-
ance is obtained.
West is the old and
Roman, but not very quaint,
town of Colchester. Com-

college
pletely unaffected by the
nearby expanding university,
the town's sense of history
limits its progress. When I
arrived the centre of the
town was sealed by a massive
unmoving traffic jam. The
only surprise? I was the only
student on the bus to the
university.
