THE SITUATION IN PHYSICS
R i f y A b d u l l a
The simple request made
to the Physics Admin, was
for the senior common room
on level eight to be made
common to undergraduates
as well. This has developed
into an internal political hell.
H is probably due to the
fact that the suggestion was
made by the 'lefty' element
in Physics, but the situation
as it now stands seems to
suggest that it would have
received the same reception
even if the well known re-
actionary Dr. Pain had sug-
gested it. What surprises me
is that everybody, but every
body, keeps harping on the
same argument that com-
monising level eight would
be a physical impossibility.
Yes, of course it would be
if the assumption made was
that all the undergraduate
population would be stupid
enough to pile into the place
if it were already full. Any
reasonable student would go
away after a quick look
around the place suggested it
was too crowded.
The suggestion that an
area on level four be cleared
for undergraduate use seems
quite reasonable at first
glance. Our diplomatic pseud
and departmental represen-
tative on Council seems to
have accepted this idea.
Subir Chattergee seems to
be deviating a bit. I agree
with him that second best
is better than nothing, but
this is one bargain the un-
dergraduate will not benefit
from. The general idea was
to provide a place where stu-
dent and teacher could meet
informally. At the moment
the tutorial system in the
department has a lot to be
desired. Many students agree
that nothing much can be
done simply because there
are too many juniors, but
there should be every effort
made to improve the low
communication level. How
many Academic Advisors
can boast that they have ac-
tually seen (let alone talked
to) their pupils from the
second year more than twice
this year?
The only person who has
suggested a reasonable ans-
wer to me is Professor Kib-
ble. Certainly there should
be a common room on level
four, but both level four and
eight should be common to
all. This would take care of
the crowding problem. This
is what Physics Admin
should offer the students,
they should not have to ask
for it.
At the moment the stu-
dents are expected to walk
in for lectures or lab work
and then walk straight out
again. This is definitely not
a happy state of affairs. The
atmosphere in Physics is
really bad; ten per cent of
the students in second year
are registered with the col-
lege psychiatrist and receiv-
ing treatment. The psychia-
trist would agree that there
would be fewer cases if the
students felt they belonged
to the Physics Department.
I am convinced that the
two suicides from Physics
last year could have been
prevented if there had been
a more homely atmosphere
around the place. I am
ashamed to admit that my
Department, apart from
keeping the matter hush hush
have done nothing else. Pro-
fessor Mathews seems more
interested in the Academic
improvements possible in
the Department — the
amount of work should be
better spread out, etc.—but
surely the atmosphere in
which the work is to be done
must be improved first.
Apparently the common
room on level eight was ob-
tained by some devious
method. College rules state
that there should not be any
common rooms in working
areas. Technically, the room
now used as a common
room was recommended as
a conference room. Profes-
sor Mathews suggests that it
would be impossible to get
the matter of an extra com-
mon room passed by the Col-
lege authorities, but a slight
diplomatic wangle might get
us faster results than a blunt
attack on the rules. He also
pointed out that communica-
tion between post-graduates
was minimum as well, and
that the only place where
they got together was the
level eight common room
where they discussed re-
search projects. The com-
monisation of level four and
eight would override this
problem.
This simple request for
a common room has caused
sheer hell in the Department
and it doesn't leave the new
head administrator, Professor
Mathews, very comfortable.
Anonymity is a word
every undergraduate is fami-
liar with; the Physics under-
graduate flounders in a wil-
derness of faces, confused
and bewildered by the wealth
of information available. An
individual in the largest de-
partment in the "best scien-
tific INSTITUTION in the
country" has to organise a
chaotic deluge of ideas (both
scientific and otherwise)
everyday to stay above
water. So he either with-
draws' into an impenetrable
shell of apathy, shutting out
completely what he consid-
ers trivia, or tries to soothe
his privileged conscience by
meandering around in the
schizoid confusion of trying
to see both sides of a prob-
lem at the same time. In
either case he probably
comes to the same conclu-
sion that he holds a one way
ticket from nothing to no-
where.
Exceptions will always
occur. Some in the former
group will manage to isolate
themselves in a cocoon of
physics and the output will
be an undistorted signal, the
model physicist, who will
probably end up as a head
of department.
The others engage in an
aimless bustle of social ac-
tivity in an effort to conceal
their flagging idealism and
amorphous, half realised
dreams. Adolescent idealists
find their methods of attain-
ing inner peace, which they
consider! viable, summarily
rejected even by colleagues
who prefer the security of
the beaten track and rely on
often repeated, brief sojourns
in the quasi-friendly world
of alcohol.

The room which Ricardo
now inhabits was originally
a third year physics work
room. It has now become a
D.I.C. room, a place where
theoretical physicists read
for their Diploma of Imper-
ial College.
Last week Ricardo was
treated to a storm of insults
by the already very popular
Dr. Pain. The following Fri-
day, the twelfth of Febru-
ary, Interaction was to hold
a meeting in the D.I.C. room,
a thing which they .have
been doing for the last two
months, by arrangement with
the students who use that
room. Around 3.00 p.m.,
before the meeting started,
some third year students
stormed into the room and
j started arguing and gener-
ally making a nuisance of
themselves. The Interaction
group continued the meeting
and the third year students
brought some re-inforce-
ments in. (About fifteen
more arrived.) The re-infor-
cements had been told they
would be treated to a keg
of beer by Dr. Pain if they
would duck Ricardo in the
Round Pond in Kensington
Gardens. The following is
the literature distributed by
the Interaction Group:
"Dr. Pain in a provoked
incident brought about by
his mis-representations inci-
ted 15 confused third year
students to disrupt a meet-
ing which Ricardo Turullols,
P.G., was attending and to
drag him to Kensington Gar-
dens where he was deposited
in the Round Pond — all
this for a keg of beer.
What motivated this ex-
naval commander to incite
students to violence? Dr.
Pain and some of his con-
temporaries seem to be an-
noyed by Basis Group; he
said that he was 'frightened'
of Ricardo because 'he's cle-
ver' and a 'danger to us.'
Only that week the 'entropy
producing' Ricardo had been
publicly insulted by Dr.
Pain, and there are also ru-
mours that certain senior |
staff wanted to pass a mo-
tion at a staff meeting where-
by several active members
of Basis' Group would be
expelled from the College.
Did Dr. Pain have anything
to do with it?
Afterwards, Dr. Pain ad-
mitted freely of having
offered the barrel of beer for
the incident. When Professor
Mathews was asked about
the activities of Dr. Pain he
appeared shocked and said,
"I'm a bit non-plussed". In-
cidentally Dr. Pain was |
caught spying at the Gen-
eral Meeting on the 11th. On j
hearing about it a junior
staff commented, 'Oh what
a tit'."
Since then Dr. Pain has
apologised to the undergra-
duates for his absurd be-
haviour.
