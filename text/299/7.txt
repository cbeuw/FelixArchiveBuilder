I.C. Reach Cup Final

For the second time in two
years, IC 1st X V have
reached the Gutteridge cup
final to be held at Motspur
Park on Sat. March 6th.
Last Wednesday they de-
cisively trounced UC at
Shenley, the scoreline really
flattering the home side.
Played in really wet and
muddy conditions, the stan-
dard of rugby produced by
IC was really extraordinary
and they fully deserve this
rather unexpected success.
The rather well-known
figure of the referee awarded
IC a penalty in the first few
minutes of the game, accord-
ingly thumped over by the
evergreen Swinnerton. How-
ever UC quickly equalised
by a similar penalty, only
for Swinnerton to put over
his second attempt of the
game. A third attempt
floated wide only for
(baldy?) Hollingsworth to
collect, the IC pack to win
yet another ruck and the
ball fed out to second-row
man Owens who crushed
(not sidestepped, Steve) his
way over for a try which
Swinnerton converted.
This gave the signal for a
prodigious onslaught of IC
pressure — the pack play-
ing some really sterling stuff.
Against the run of play UC
pulled back to 11 pts. to 9
pts. through a penalty and a
dropped goal — however
winger Anderson scored an
opportunist (lucky?) try
which brought his season's
total to 21. This score of
14-9 remained until half-
time.
The pace of the second-
half slowed considerably
and as the conditions gradu-
ally worsened, only the dis-
cipline and fervour of the
IC side kept UC out. From
one of the numerous for-
ward foot rushes IC gained
possession for Swinnerton
to crush over for a try
which he narrowly failed to
convert this score of 17-9
remained into injury time
until the UC flyhalf who had
a really brilliant game kicked
two penalties to bring UC
within two points of the IC
score. However the referee
finally gave up and blew the
whistle to the delight of
numerous IC supporters.
hard fought cup match
every IC player emerged
with honour but I'm sure
the team would not begrudge
Hollingsworth a special
mention — he did more to
attract attention than merely
flash his bald head around.
The pack's splendid effort
was fully supported by the
fine play of halfbacks James
and Harrison — still Swin-
nerton got 11 pts. as per
usual!
Remember the final —
free coaches, a splendid
afternoon's enjoyment at
Motspur.

IC 0, Guys Hosp. 1
Both sides started nerv-
ously and it was Guys who
first began to settle down
and after five minutes play-
forced a short corner. The
resulting shot was stopped
on the line by the right back
and Guys easily converted
the penalty flick. This
seemed to inspire the IC for-
wards who constantly at-
tacked the hesitant Guys1
defenders, and were eventu-
ally awarded a penalty flick
after a short corner. Dave
Wilson, attempting to score
his fourteenth goal of the
season took the stroke, but
it was well-saved by the
goalkeeper.
The first half continued
with the Guys' goal under
considerable pressure and
there was no further score
before half-time. In the
second half, the pattern of
the game became quite
clear: IC constantly attack-
ing an eight or nine man de-
fence. Short corners were
awarded at frequent inter-
vals but none of the set

Again as one looks around to wide and desolate spaces
of Sports page, one wonders whether some clubs exist at all
or are so good as not to wish to lower themselves by sending
accounts to Felix! Still, that filled three copy lines — even if
I do mean it!
As many residents of South Side will probably know the
Hyde Park relay is upon us — or rather will have happened
by this edition. The various international sides competing
have produced an interesting side result. The Spanish Univer-
sity side brought with them their Director of Sport who was
interested in forming sporting(?) associations with IC, especi-
ally in the fields of soccer, rugby, basketball and athletics.
This could be very interesting to those clubs considering go-
ing abroad next year — for any further information please
contact me or the Hyde Park relay organiser.
Sad to relate, the men's Hockey XI were knocked out
of their cup competition by Guy's last week — a question of
not being able to get the ball into the net only, I gather. The
soccer 1st XI cancelled their intended cup match against
Goldsmith's when the referee turned out to be none other
than a Goldsmith's student; we wish them luck when they
eventually do play — after the captain returns from trips to
home etc.
Will they join the 1st X V and the women's hockey XI
at Motspur on March 6th — from a purely Bacchanalian
(topical?) point of view, I hope not.
moves worked and Guys
hung on to the final whistle.
It must be mentioned that
this was the first defeat of
the 1st team by a college
side this season, and that

On Wednesday, 17th of
February, I.C. met U.C. in
the semi-final of the Cup. It
was wet and windy and con-
sequently the conditions were
not very conducive for at-
tractive football. As was ex-
pected, the game was evenly
contested, for the two pre-
vious meetings between these
teams have ended in draws.
In the first half, the I.C.
team played against the wind
and against the gradient, the
intention being to hold the
opposition in the first half
and then to capitalise on the
natural advantages in the
second. The defence carried
out its task efficiently and the
opposition had no real scor-
ing chances. The forwards,
however, after many intelli-
gent build-ups, did not seem
to be able to put the ball in-
to the net. Pete Lonnen in
particular, created several
situations, which would nor-
mally have resulted in goals
but at half-time there was no
score.
The start of the second
half saw the I.C. forwards
trying desperately to open
the scoring, but poor finish-
ing kept the score sheet
blank. U.C. then began to
get into the game and until
the end of the game, pressed
forward continuously. Dur-
ing this assault, the I.C. de-
fence kept their ground ex-
tremely well, particularly
John Jenkins, Paul Maslin
and Rick Widelski. At full-
time the score was 0-0.
Against the wishes of the
entire I.C. team, the referee
and the U.C. players insisted
that extra-time should be
played. The aggression in-
voked in the I.C. team by this
decision proved to be the de-
ciding factor in the match.
Throughout extra-time I.C.
were well on top and it was
evident that a goal must soon
come. It finally came in the
second period of extra-time.
Pete Lonnen put over a good
cross from the left and Alan
Thebault went up for it with
the U.C. goalkeeper. From
the resulting collision, the
ball ran loose to Dave San-
derson, who had worked
tirelessly throughout the
game, and he prodded it in-
to the net.
With only a few minutes
remaining U.C. launched an
all out attack to try and
equalise. They would have
been successful but for a
brilliant save by Bob Barley
in the dying seconds.
The I.C. seconds have now
played twenty-four games
this season without defeat
and look capable of repeat-
ing last season's performance,
where they won both the
League and Cup competi-
tions.
