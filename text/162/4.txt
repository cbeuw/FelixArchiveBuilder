ATHLETICS
Sports Day, although fine was slightly
marred for the spectators and officials
by a chilly wind. This wind, however,
considerably helped the sprinters but was
against the long and triple jumpers.
With the University truck at Motspur in
its usual excellent condition it was unfort-
unate that all three colleges were fielding
depleted teams. Mines had lost some mem-
bers to a field course, Guilds were without
Maodonald (University Captain) who is
College reoordholder for the sprints, and
B.C.S. had lost Clifton (Half-mile
Champion, 1960) and Wenk (440 yd. ie-
oordholder). The last three were at Lough-
borough with the University team.
The team result was an overwhelming
win for E.C.S. with 174 points to the 128
of Guilds and 81 of Mines. Although this
was B.C.S.'s second win in succession it
should be noted that Guilds have won 23
times in the last thirty years. B.C.8. had
the individual winner in thirty events as
well as winning the Tug o' War and Half
Mile Belay, while Guilds won the 4x110 yd.
Belay and had Wigginton first in the Pole
Vault. Mines honour was upheld by Fair-
field and Nicholson who were first and
second in the High Jump.
The B.C.S. captain, Spioer, set his team
a good example by winning the first event,
the 120 yd. Hurdles, but the outstanding
individual was Harrison (B.C.S.) who be-
sides running in the Belay won the 100 yds
in 10.2 Bee, the 220 yds in 22.7 see.,
the Long Jump in 20 ft. 3 in., and the
Triple Jump in 42 ft. 8J in. — the latter
being a new Sports Day best performance.
The trophy for the best Field Events per-
formance was returned by Connolly
(B.C.S.), who again won the Shot Putt
(40 ft. 9i in.) and the Javelin (162 ft.
8i in.).
The College record to be beaten was the
1,500 m. steeplechase where Cleator, who
had already easily won the 1 Mile in 4
min. 19.9 sees., broke his own record with
a time of 4 min. 26.9 sec. Last term
Cleator had also run the 3 Miles in the
exoellent time of 14.05, which besides be-
ing a new College record was thefi the
fastest time in the country this year.
Mines are to be especially congratulated
on their performance as they only had
nine competitors (including their Presid-
ent, Paul Buet, who took sixth place in
the Long Jump) for all fourteen track and
field events.
The Staff Baoe, in which the Presidents
also competed, was won by a surprise en-
try, Miss Anne Mathews of the Civil En-
gineering Dept., who easily beat Messrs.
Hill, Greaves and Buet and three male
members of staff 1 The handicap system
so ungallant as to beat the lady even if
ensured that none of the men could be
he BO desired.
The only other notable competitor was
Mike Barron, who not only played for the
Basketball Club, who beat ICWSC 3-1 at
netball, but also ran for his old College
in the Half-mile Belay and the 440 yds.
The latter event was won by Meade
(B.C.S.) in 51.09, while the Half-mile
gave B.C.S. yet another viotory, Wood
winning easily in 2 min. 4.3 seo.

I C W A
At the U.L. Athletios Championships.
I.C-W.A. not only won the Sherwood
Challege Cup for the first time for several
years, but also oame second to St. Mary's
College for the Imperial College Challenge
Cup. The members of the team were:
Beryl Milner — 440 yds, 220 yds, 100
yds, 80 m. hurdles,
long jump.
Carole Bedingfield — 440 yds, high
jump, discus and
javelin throwing.
Hilary Lear — 220 yds.
Carolyn Eussell — 880 yds.
Janet Hiscox _ 880 yds.
Pat Eidout — 100 yds.
Madge Pleaden — long jump.
In the U.L. Women's Swimming League,
I.C.W.A. came third to Bedford College
and the Eoyal Free Hospital; defeating
Goldsmith's, Middlesex Hospital, U.C.,
Westfield, Chelsea and Q.M.C. It is the
first time that I.C.W.A. have done so
well, and thanks are due to the untiring
efforts of Janet Hiscox and Buth Oldham.
I.C. were narrowly defeated by St.
Mary's Hospital in the U.L. Champion-
ships at Motspur Park on Saturday 13th
May, despite some fine Individual per-
formances.
On Wednesday, John Cleator easily won
the 3000 m. steeplechase in the good time
of 9 min. 25.8sec, with Ted Wilkins run-
ning well to gain seeona place. We also
picked up points in the triple jump
through Jim Harrison (3rd) and the two-
mile walk, with John Collins finishing
4th, in his first serious race in his new
event.
We had a fine start on Saturday, with
John Cleator winning very well in the one-
mile from Speryn of St. Mary's, a very
fine performance. Paul Potter and Archie
MacDonald also achieved good perform-
ances, winning the pole vault and 220 yds
respectively. G. Wenk dominated the 880
yds, leading the whole way, and winning
in 1 min. 55.5 sec, for which he was
awarded the trophy for the best track per-
formance of the afternoon. Ian Linklater
excelled himself in the 440 yds hurdles,
aohieving a personal best performance in
5th place.
I.C. also did well in the 100 yds, once
again Jim Harrison and Archie MacDonald
(3rd and 4th). Dave Hammonds and Ted
Wilkins worked through the field in the
three-mile, and were lying a very com-
fortable 2nd and 3rd behind Mitchell
(U.C.) at the end of two miles. Wilkins
then opened up a 40 yds gap on Hammonds,
and was going well rtintil the last lap,
when he very surprisingly cracked up,
probably due to the hot weather.
Hammonds pressed on to take 2nd place,
and Wilkins gamely finished in 5th place.
The final track event in which I.C. was
represented was the 440 yds. Archie Mac-
Donald, in his 3rd event of the afternoon,
very nearly pulled off a surprise by win-
ning, but had to be content with 2nd
place, in a new College record time of
49.2 sec. Bill Wood hung on well to 4th
place in 51.3 sec.
Once again in the throwing events I.C.
were carried along by two people, Connolly
and Alcock. Colin Connolly waded through
all four throwing events, and finished with
two 3rds and two 4ths. Tony Alcook fin-
ished 4th in the discus, despite his efforts
in the 120 yds hurdles on Wednesday.
I.C.W.A must be congratulated on win-
ning the Sherwood Cup, which was well
deserved for their enthusiasm if not their
skill.
We are now looking forward to our next
annual battle with St. Mary's and a re-
versal of Saturday's result.
HOCKEY TOUR OF HOLLAND
At 9.15 on Thursday April 6th a train
left Liverpool Street Station bound for
Harwich, containing an eager band of fit
young men, and in the same carriage was
the fourteen strong party of the Imperial
College Hockey Club bound for Holland.
The North Sea crossing was uneventful
with a calm sea and blue skies providing
a good omen for our stay in Holland,
and it proved to be for the weather re-
mained perfect throughout the tour.
We arrived in Groningen at 11.00 p.m.
after a long and tiring journey (during
which we achieved the distinction of drink-
ing the train dry in one-and-a half-hours)
and were met by a large crowd of the
hockey club "Forward" of the University.
There followed a somewhat heavy re-
ception at which the menu consisted of
beer, beer, gerever, brandjwin and
more beer, all of which proved a. little
too much for several members of the party
but which was a foretaste of things to
come.
The following day, having spent the
morning recovering, we played the For-
wardiens (a5
team drawn from the tour
ing party whioh came to England two
years ago) and thanks to two fine goals
by Clarke, some judicious use of feet and
ablfel !umpfring by the secretary, whose
range of vision had been rendered some-
what restricted by the previous night's
festivities, we managed to draw a most
6n;oyable game 2-2.
On Saturday we were guests at a re-
ception given by the town Hockey Club
on the oecasion of their 35th anniversary ;
this was followed by a thoroughly enjoy-
able dance, and as a result of whioh very
little sleep was had by all. This also re-
sulted in our arriving at the Mixed Hockey
Tournament next day a little late though
still in time to learn that we had lost
our first match. Both our teams continued
in this vein with the result that we wpn
t share in a bottle of oinjars as the strong-
est teams in the tournament. This was
followed by a tea dance at which the only
beverage was beerl During the day bi-
cycles were introduced as a means of tran-
sport with chaotic results, and several
members, of the team learnt some new
Dutoh words.
On Monday" we played a match against
the University team, and fie whole team
really exoelled itself. It was a very clean,
fast game and the standard bf hookey
shown by both sides was very high: the
fact that we won 4-1 speaks well for our
performance. The goals were scored by
Phillips (3) and de Brookert. That even-
ing we were given a farewell dinner in
their Union whioh proved a most riotous
event, putting recent events in Algeria
and Cuba very muoh in the shade; the
mortality rate amongst plates, glasses and
diners was very high. The whole evening
was a very fine conclusion to a memorable
visit to Groningen;' but proved yet again
to be too much for some.
Next day we moved on to Amsterdam
where we spent a recuperative 24 hours
in sight-seeing whioh included a trip
round the canals and dooks on the
Wednesday morning and a visit to the
Amstel Brewery at whioh the tour of the
works was cut down to a quarter of an
hour — our guide proved TO be a uutch
international hockey player. We moved on
to Delft that day and after being very
well |recBived we played indoor hockey
at a fabulous new sports centre. The
game is played six-a-side with sub-
stitutes, on a pitch 30 yards by 40
yards, and is rather like ice-hockey in
that the side walls can be used. Despite
the fact that the English style of play is
not very well suited to the game, we won
one and lost one game against two teams
which had had considerable experience.
Thursday was a free day and was spent
sight-seeing in Rotterdam, The Hague and
Hilversum. On Friday we played S'.V.H.C,
the Catholic section of Delft University,
and were well beaten 4-1 in a very hard,
fast game on a rather bumpy pitch. We
were entertained that evening by the S.V
gin-drinking club to a sowewhat unusual
dinner where the food was served mostly
on the walls of the room. The company
then proceeded en masse to the cinema,
which seemed to be a regular Friday even-
ing oeourenoe, as the public very wisely
stayed away. We then returned to their
Union, where the bar remains open un-
til there are less than five people present:
as a result 5.00 a.m. seemed to be the
average closing lime during our stav.
On Saturday we moved to The Hague
where we played against Groengel H.C..
one of the many hockey clubs in the city,
and won deservedly 2-1 in what proved to
be yet another enjoyable game. That even-
ing we were entertained to a meal in a
Chinese restaurant and there followed a
round of some of the night-clubs which
proved highly educational.
We letf The Hague at 10.20 in the morn-
ing for London, all very tired, nearly all
very broke, but having had a most memor-
able ten days in what we all agreed was a
very pleasant country and amongst wonder-
fully hospitable people.
