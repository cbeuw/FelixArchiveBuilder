Thief Thwarted
Beer Festival - "A Success"
Three tons of beer were quaffed from 1,200 glasses during the Royal
College of Science Union's Beer Festival in the JCR on Wednesday, writes
Lynn Bravery.
The event, which launched this year's Rag Week was hailed as 'the
booziest night of the year'. It was proclaimed "a success" by Paul Thomas,
the event organiser. Accompanied by the sound of morris dancers merrily
japing in the corner, Paul informed Felix that there had been "no trouble at
all" and that he was "very happy" with the way things had gone. The
atmosphere of the place suggested that this year's Rag Week would be one
to remember (or not, depending on whether you sampled any of the fine
ales on offer!).

College security, this week, foiled
another attempt at smash and grab
vandalism. The attempt occurred in
Southside Bar on Tuesday morning.
A man was disturbed while
breaking into a games machine,
which he had dragged into one of
the bar's toilets. He is described as
white, in his early twenties and
about 5' 10" in height with a slim
build. Witnesses reported that the
man had been waiting in the bar
from about 8am and was later seen
attempting to enter Falmouth
Keogh Hall.
The man managed to escape
when challenged in Southside, but
several bags of coins were
recovered by security.
This is the latest in a series of
attempted thefts and vandalism in
Southside and the halls of
residences this term and crime in
general has been on the increase at
Imperial College this year.
Triple First For IC
BY PAUL DIAS
The first U K student branch of the
Institute of Electronic and Electrical
Engineers (IEEE - pronounced I-
triple-E) is set to start at Imperial
College in two weeks' time. The
IEEE is devoted to the promotion of
professional standards in engineering
industries. Student membership at
Imperial College will be open to
those in the Electrical Engineering
and Computing departments, as
well as those on the ISE
cross-department course.
An interim committee, led by
third year Computing student Elen
Marie Austenaa, is organising the
launch of Imperial College's IEEE
branch. Students from eligible
departments should contact M s
Austenaa for membership
application forms. Students can join
the international IEEE organisation
for the reduced fee of about Â£15.
The committee post elections are to
be held on Wednesday 17th
November.
The Imperial College student
branch hopes to hold talks by
industry representatives and visit
companies along with a range of
social events. Student members of
the I E E E w i l l also be able to
receive publications covering the
whole range of industries supported
by the IEEE.
One member of the interim
committee said, "We are extremely
pleased that the country's first IEEE
student branch is to be at Imperial
College, and we hope that as many
students as possible will take the
opportunity to join."
NUS To Become A Charity
BY SHAUN JOYNSON
In a move designed to protect itself
from government reforms, the
National Union of Students (NUS)
has announced plans to become a
charity. The plan to apply for
charitable status was announced on
Monday at the end of the
Department For Education's 30-
day period of consultation over the
future of student unions.
The N U S President, Lorna
Fitzsimmons, said of the move,
"Our charity will be in the best
interests of students". The proposal
to turn the NUS into a charity will
be put before the Charity
Commissioners later this month.
The NUS hopes that the granting
of charitable status will allow them
to benefit from a wide range of
educational grants which, at
present, they are ineligible for. A
further benefit of the move, NUS
leaders believe, is that it will allow
the Union to conduct paid
educational research on behalf of
clients in both education and
industry. "This will benefit the
public, by providing them with
useful research on the quality of
education today," said Ms
Fitzsimmons.
The N U S claims that students
will be unaffected by its switch to
charitable status, as it is intended to
split the organisation in two.
Student affairs would be handled by
the charity, whilst the campaigning
work would be handled by the main
body of the Union.
Over the years, the N U S has
been noted for its highly vocal
campaigning style on behalf of
students. Suggestions that the move
to charitable status will lead to the
demise of the NUS as a 'political'
pressure group were refuted in an
interview on IC Radio by N U S
national executive member Ian
Moore. "There will still be a
campaigning side of the NUS, but
that will take place in a separate
arm to the charity," said Mr Moore.
Denying that the charity move
was a reaction to the government's
apparent hostility towards the NUS,
M r Moore told IC Radio News
Editor, Paul Dias, that the matter
had been under consideration for a
number of years. "The government
legislation is looking at dis-
couraging local students unions
from affiliating to the NUS and,
naturally, we considered that when
we made the decision. By making
this move, we come under
charitable law, and can prove that
the money that we have is spent
properly."
The results of the NUS's change
to a charity will not take effect for a
few years, Mr Moore added. "As a
charity, we can apply for charitable
and educational trust monies and
there are advantages in that. I hope
we're not going to be in the
situation where we've got begging
bowls out and, hopefully, if the
government drops its ludicrous
legislative ideas, then we'll be able
to continue with our current system
of collecting affiliation fees".
