Editorial
Do you remember when you were little and you
were asked what you wanted to be when you
grew up? The replies of Policeman, Fireman,
Doctor, Nurse, Teacher, Vet and so on were
often to be heard. In those days we wanted to be
the sort of people we read about in our story
books.
If you ask the students around this college
what job they want when they leave here, a fair
number will answer you with: "One that pays
well." They aren't too bothered about whether
they are happy doing their work, just as long as
they are earning enough. I guess some of them
will find their job satisfaction coming from the
pay cheque at the end of the month.
There are some who will not be bothered
about the money and will just want a job in
which they will be happy, but in my experience,
they are a much smaller number. Then there are
people around who are somewhere between the
two, who want to be happy and who also don't
want to be on the poverty line.
Whenever I'm asked what I want to do and I
say that I want to teach, I get comments on the
low pay and long hours. The hours I put into
Felix in a week vastly outnumber the hours I
would work as a teacher and the pay is a lot
lower as well. But I'm enjoying it. The money
doesn't bother me. I honestly don't think about
it. I'd go for job satisfaction above salary any
day.
The average starting salary for a 21 year old
with a second class honours first degree is in the
region of £12,800. I don't think I'd know what
to do with that sort of money, let alone the tens
of thousands of pounds that graduates from this
place will no doubt be earning in a few years
time. I've pretty much survived on the measly
student grant for the last three years and could
quite happily carry on that way.
I was talking to someone recently who was
equating the cost of a flight he was taking to the
States with the price of musical equipment. I
asked him what he'd have done with the money
if he hadn't been going abroad and he said he'd
probably have just frittered it away.
I couldn't fritter money away of I tried. I
have to put a great deal of thought into anything
before I'll buy it. I'll spend hours working out if
I really need it and if it's the cheapest one.
But there are a lot of people out there who
can have no trouble spending money. The
average student leaves university with an
overdraft of about £2,000 (I think that's about
right). Some people will have run up the debt
from expensive accommodation (and let's face
it, even college accommodation isn't cheap),
buying text books and so on, but there are plenty
of people who have spent it on down the bar on
smoking and drinking.
I know of people who have left college with
nearly three times the 'average' overdraft and
full student loans aswell. They are the sort of
people who expect to be able to walk straight
into a well-paid job which will solve all their
problems. Chances are they probably will, and
then they'll just spend all that aswell. It gets to
be a bit of a vicious circle. They know they've
got the money available to spend and so they
spend it. Then when they run out, they go and
get an extension on their overdraft and spend
some more. I can't see it ending for them.
They've got so used to having money and being
able to get more if they need it. I wonder what
they'll do when one day they ask for an
overdraft and the bank manager says "No!"
