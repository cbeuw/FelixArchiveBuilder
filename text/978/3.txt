Bogus Degree Coach
BY LYNN BRAVEY
A top information technology
officer for Australian Telecom has
resigned following allegations of a
bogus degree supposedly from
Imperial College.
Dr Sorrentino resigned last
Monday, five weeks after accepting
the post. Imperial College Registry
were unable to find any records
regarding his PhD. Sorrentino
stated that the allegations were "a
red herring" and that he resigned
for "personal reasons".
The story coincides with recent
research by the Institute of
Manpower Studies. According to
their findings, graduates are
becoming increasingly desperate for
jobs and are faking qualifications
on their application forms. Aware
that many potential employers
rarely check the information, many
give fake results. With the job
market now so competitive,
untrained selection staff are often
told to only select candidates from
the 'old' universities.
Medical Negotiations
BY ANDREW TSENG,
NEWS EDITOR
Imperial College has taken a further
step in becoming a medical 'super-
school'. Sir Ronald Oxburgh,
Rector of Imperial College, has
announced the start of negotiations
with three medical institutes with a
view to the merging of Imperial
College with each of them.
The announcement comes
almost one year after the Executive
Committee of Imperial College's
Governing Body expressed its
approval of the merging of the
Royal Postgraduate Medical
School, the Institute of Cancer
Research and the National Heart
and Lung Institute with Imperial
College.
Sir Ronald commented, "It is
giving us the opportunity to rethink
medical education."
Magazine
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
Members of Imperial College's
superlative Boat Club were shocked
this week to learn that their coach,
Bill Mason, is said to look like a
terrorist. The apparant resemblance
was spotted by the executive
committee of the Amateur Rowing
Association (ARA) when reviewing
the cover photo on what was to be
the latest issue of the Association's
magazine, 'Regatta'.
The cover featured Mr Mason,
dressed in black clothes and a
sinister-looking balaclava with slits
in the eyes and nose, shouting
instructions through a megaphone
to rowers on the Thames. The
photograph, which had been
waiting to be used for six months,
was described as sinister, with M r
Mason looking like 'an I R A
terrorist reviewing his men'.
The A R A ordered the issue to be
withdrawn. The 16,000 copies of
the magazine, which were to be
mailed to members and other
subscribers on Tuesday, had to be
replaced with issues with a different
cover. The replacing of the cover
photograph with one of Mr Mason
in graduation regalia caused a delay
of one week. The chairman of the
committee, Mrs Di Ellis, said that
the original picture was
"inappropriate in any
circumstances".
The cover photograph was
intended to lead into a story about
Mr Mason, an Olympic and Imperial
College coach, who recently
received two awards - an honorary
degree from Imperial College and
the ARA's medal of honour.
The editor of the magazine, Mr
Chris Dodd, had redesigned the
magazine for this issue. He
commented, "We were looking for
a cover which had impact and boy,
we found it."
