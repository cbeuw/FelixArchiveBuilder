Curry of curries
It should be easy for most of you to
purchase the ingredients for this
recipe and if you have trouble, it's
tough, but my advice to you is move
to somewhere where you can. I got
all my ingredients from Tooting
Market where it is possible to buy
both dried and fresh versions of most
spices, I'm sure there are similar
Pakistani grocers throughout West
London. If you still don't fancy the
minimal amount effort involved in
creating a superb authentic dish I can
only suggest you get on a bus to
Southall or Brick Lane to see and taste
what you're missing—these places are
definitely worth a visit anyway and
there is an abundance of Asian
groceries in Southall especially where
you can pick up some unusual pickles
and chutneys—beware though as
these aren't to everyone's taste—you
won't know until you've tried them.
Live dangerously!
I N G R E D I E N T S :
V* inch of oil in pan
8 cardamum pods
5 bits cinnamon stick
2oz corriander (fresh green leaf)
6 cloves
2 green chillies
2 red chillies
2 tsp cayenne powder
3 tsp ready mixed masala powder
Small tin tomato puree
Large tin plum tomatoes
Level tsp salt
2 large onion
4 cloves garlic
Small piece of root ginger
l'A lbs chicken
l
A lb basmati rice
M E T H O D :
Heat oil in a deep saucepan until very
hot and add the cardamums,
cinnamon stick, cloves, green and red
chillies (both chopped up small). Fry
this for 5 minutes. While all these
spices are cracking and popping (a bit
similar to Rice Crispies really) chop
the onions, garlic and ginger until you
get a pulp. Put this pulp into the pan
and leave for at least 10 minutes until
all the onion has dissolved. While this
is happening make a paste from the
masala powder, cayenne (chili)
powder and a few drops of boiled
water and open the cans of tomato
puree and plum tomatoes (tricky!) put
these in with the rest of the ingredients
along with some salt and the washed
and skinned chicken (chicken is the
easiest but you can use other meats
if you like, you may have to lightly
fry it first and cook it for longer).
STIR, STIR, STIR! Now turn the heat
right down, in fact the lowest setting
possible, and leave to cook
thoroughly for 45 minutes. Half-way
through the cooking time throw in the
fresh corriander leaves.
Rinse the rice several times in water
and sort out all the hard, gritty bits—a
good guide for cooking this type of
rice is twice as much water asriceand
taste to see when it's cooked.
Easy isn't it?

How fresh is
your food?
Meats and poultry
Bacon and cooked meats should never
be hard and dry looking; it is
advisable to buy bacon in polythene
bags to keep it moist.
Fresh meat should be moist-looking,
if dry and hard it has been exposed
to the air for too long a period.
Beef should have some fat, as this
shows a good quality and will give the
meat a moist texture as well as being
tender. The fat should always look
firm and pale cream in colour, the
lean meat should be bright red.
L a m b should have fairly transparent
looking fat and the lean meat should
be pale pink.
Pork lean meat should be pale pink
and very firm, with very firm white
fat.
Chicken should be white fleshed and
firm looking.
