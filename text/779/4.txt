This week in past years, F E L I X has
been filled with the same old stories
about Fresher's Week (or whatever
the equivalent at the time was) and
assorted introductions to College.
Mixed in with these: stories of new
buildings (the "new main entrance to
City and G u i l d s " , 1964), shoddy
workmanship (the U n i o n
gymnasium), and lack of
accommodation. Speaking of
accommodation, how do you like this
little gem, regarding the acquisition
of the leases of eight flats in Hamlet
Gardens in 1971: " T h e flats are in
excellent condition and are generally
better than those that students would
normally find.'' See last week's
F E L I X for developments since then...
The edition in which this is
reported, was incidentally, the first
one to be issued free. Before this, the
fortnightly copy of F E L I X had cost
the princely sum of 6d, or 2'/2p. It
was an interesting edition in other
respects too; Piers Corbyn (a latter
day Trotsky?) was then a post
graduate student at I C , and making
big news. This week the story is of
how he fended off the College's
attempts to get rid of him, presumably
because of his political activities, by
withdrawing his grant. Turning to the
back page for the rest of this
gruesome tale, you see the headline
" C o r b y n B u s t e d " . During the
summer the flat of the much harrassed
Corbyn had been raided by the drugs
squad, who found £2 worth of hash.
The luckless student was promptly
arrested, and for good measure
accused o f handling stolen
property—one traffic cone, one
roadside lamp, and one local authority
sign concerning dogs and footpaths.
But enough about Corbyn. This
was not the only excursion into crime
on the pages of F E L I X . In 1958 we
find the case of the missing M G
Magnette in which, for once, an IC
student welcomed the intervention of
the police. The car, borrowed from
his father, disappeared when the
student was sitting for an exam.
Suspecting a student prank, he made
a painstaking search of the area before
informing the police. But the car was
used for the getaway after two men
stole £7000 in a violent robbery.
Weeks later the car was found,
damaged and abandoned, and the
culprits were found. The student
appeared as a witness at the
preliminary trial, at which, he
complained, he was treated with less
respect than the prisoners.

Indeed in 1958 one of the front page
stories is a call for a report in full by
the 1957 Karakoram expedition. Six
students under the leadership of Eric
Shipton spent three months examining
glaciers, and completed surveying,
geological and general exploratory
work. However, fifteen months later
the Mount Everest Foundation and
College's Exploration Board had seen
only a 700-word report for the £1000
and £3052 they had, respectively,
donated.
On a more tragic note, F E L I X in
1964 announces the death in a
climbing accident of a member of IC
Mountaineering Club. John Phillips

companions needed treatment for
exposure.
This event makes the article next to
it pale into triviality: two out of the
three newly elected Union sabbaticals
resigning before even starting their
jobs, leaving the posts unfilled for the
new year. Other stories filling out the
pages included the College refectories
making the biggest loss in their
history, and the sending out to first
year students of questionnaires about
their consumption of alcohol (by the
London University's Institute of
Psychiatry, not I C ' s Welfare
Committee). Perhaps one of the
clearest reminders of the passing of
time is the feature in 1971 showing
the production of F E L I X — a t a time
when it was still printed outside
College.
