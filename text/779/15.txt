Controversial
Exec Attack
Dear Judith,
The attack on the ICU Exec at Monday's Freshers' Fair
Reception by Guilds' Hitsquad has created a lot of
discussion over the last few days. The result being that
I have now put more control over the Hitsquad, hopefully
preventing any further controversy and the I C U Exec have
decided to 'fine' Guilds 50 donations of blood; hence the
reason I'm writing this letter. If there are any Guildsmen
or women out there with too much blood please come and
see me on Monday lunchtime so I can arrange the payment
of the fine.
Thankyou,
David Tyler,
C&G Union President.
Photo-call
As a photography student I am currently involved in a
photographic project concerned with documenting the
unacceptable conditions in which some students in the
London area have to live.
I would like to hear from anybody who feels their living
conditions are unacceptable (for whatever reason) and who
is willing to be photographed in their place of residence.
Anybody who would like to participate can contact me
by telephone, or by writing to the address below.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Simon Crick, Room No 18,
West Street Hotel,
23-24 West Street, Farnham,
Surrey. Tel: 0252 715372.
Disgusting
dissection
Dear Madam or Sir,
I am writing a letter to your Student Union publication
as I feel that many of your students, particularly first-years,
will appreciate a reminder about the use of animals in
Higher and Further Education.
Life Science students especially should note that at the
end of the day they have the right to exercise conscientious
objection to dissecting or vivisecting animals. There are
an ever-growing number of students who have profound
ethical objections to aquiescing in the killing of innocent,
sentient creatures, particularly when non-animal teaching
methods are available, for example, models and computer
graphics.
Unfortunately, it is the case that unsympathetic academic
!
staff may try to pressurise students to dissect, or, more
likely, will mark students down for not doing practicals,
even when they offer to do alternative (non-animal) work.
But such students deserve the full backing of their
Students' Union if victimised in this way, particularly since
the National Union of Students, at its last Conference,
agreed to uphold students' rights to "Violence-Free
Science".
In addition, at its April A G M , the National Council for
Civil Liberties agreed to campaign, where possible, to
support a student's right to object on moral grounds to
dissection.
Any student who is facing difficulties, and/or academic
penalties, for refusing to dissect or vivisect should contact
N U S , N C C L or my own organisation.
Yours faithfully,
Dominic Johnson, BUAV, Group Co-ordinator

Dear Judith,
The Positive Alternatives to Abortion Society exists to
tell students the truth about abortion and to promote the
positive alternatives. I would like to inform the new
students at Imperial about P A T A and also continue the
beneficial discussion about abortion which took place last
year, as witnessed by F E L I X ' s letter page.
Among P A T A ' s events last year were several talks given
at IC. They were given by prominent members of the
medical profession and the 'Life Movement', including
a victim of abortion. Next year's plans will be more
ambitious. They need to be! A t a time when the
Government is at last showing a willingness to listen to
Members of Parliament and members of the public on this
issue, it is sad to find many people who know not only
very little about the unborn child but also about abortion
as it is practiced today.
Last year 172,286 abortions were performed in clinics
in England and Wales, most of which fell into one category
only. O f these 168,732 were due to "risk of injury to
physical or mental health of women". This category does
not include those cases in which the mother's life is at
risk and the number of rape victims here is very l o w -
perhaps a dozen. To put this into context, the second
largest category is of abortions due to "risk of injury to
physical or mental health of existing child(ren)" and
numbers 16,176. Abortion has become a legitimate form
of family planning. This is despite the dawn of 'Post
Abortion Syndrome' which seems to undermine the object
behind this type of birth control by making the mother
vety unhappy.
If any readers feel that they do not know enough about
the subject they are welcome to attend any of our events
planned for the year. Those who want to do something
truly worthwhile this year might consider joining.
Our 'Cheese and Wine' is at 1.00pm, Thurs 15th, Senior
Common Room, Union Building.
Yours,
Mathew Soane,
Chairman, Maths II.
It is quite right that you should try to bring attention
to your club in FELIX but please do not do it in the
form of a letter. The letters page is for informed opi-
nion and debate. Such letters as yours deserve to be
on the clubs page. The next letter trying to promote
a club will be swiftly dispatched to my Clubs Editor.
Thus spake the Editor.
FELIX Friday October 9th 1987 15
