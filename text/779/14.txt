OPINION
Hitsquadding
For many of you your first encounter
with Rag will have been the flanning
of the Union Officers at Monday's
Freshers' Fair Reception. This
incident has caused a lot of ill-feeling
in the IC Union Office and so I'd like
to put forward my view as a semi-
also be questioned. Firstly, the
Hitsquad tried to hit Alan Rose, who
wears glasses, secondly no enquiries
were made to find out if anyone wore
contact lenses and thirdly no money
was raised. These tend to show that
the Hitsquad is definitely lacking in
independent onlooker. G u i l d ' s
Hitsquad is part of Guilds' Rag and
they raise money by being contracted
to 'hit' people. Just recently the
control of the Hitsquad had been very
lax and consequently they have
overstepped the mark on a number of
occasions, Monday was one such
occasion. The rules by which the
Hitsquad operate state that they can
only flan people during Rag Week,
in the past flanning has occured at
other times but this has only been
tolerated by IC Union, not condoned.
Monday's activities have certainly put
pay to any more Union tolerance. The
way the attack was carried out must
control and accountability. The Union
Exec met on Wednesday and the
question of the Hitsquad was raised.
At the time of writing the result of that
meeting is not known but the feeling
in the Union Office on Monday was
that the Hitsquad should be banned.
I feel that this would be a shame but
I do agree that the time has come for
greater control. A s the person who
proposed Dave Tyler for the post of
Guilds Union President I hope he will
make this his o w n personal
responsibility and ensure that in future
all Hitsquad rules are adhered to.

an interest in our clubs and societies,
I am willing to take round information

it. Any clubs or societies wishing to
avail themselves to this wonderfully
