More than
a holiday
It's very easy to forget that the long
summer vacation—a clear three
months of freedom to do what you
will—is a highly finite resource. Few
people ever again have such
opportunities once the demands of a
career and of family responsibilities
become major factors in life. For
more than thirty years, Imperial
College Exploration Board has
encouraged students to consider a
particularly rewarding, not to say
exotic, way of using this time—by
participation in expedition activity.
There is scarcely a region on the
earth's surface which has not been
traversed by one means or another by
Imperial College expeditions and
many hundreds of students have
effort, we have organised a series of
three illustrated lectures as part of the
Humanities Department's Tuesday
Lunchtime Lecture Programme.
The three speakers this year are as
follows:
Tues 13th Oct
Rob Palmer—'The Andros Project'
M r Palmer is one of the country's
leading cave divers and he is Director
of the 1987 International Blue Holes
Research Project in the Bahamas,

the Chogolisa Peaks'
M r Fanshawe is the National Office
of the British Mountaineering
Council. He is a former student of the
An Imperial College expedition overhauls its transport in the Omani Desert
benefited f r o m this unique
experience. This summer, for
example, we have five groups of
students in the field—climbing
Alaska's highest mountain, making an
extensive road survey across Africa,
making an underwater pollution study
in the Red Sea, carrying out a bird
fauna study in the Cameroon,
surveying land-slide incidence and
mountaineering in the East
Karakoram. Those of us closely
involved in the Exploration Board's
work are totally convinced that this
sort of activity is in the best sense of
the word educational since it
invariably deepens people's
understanding of the world, and of
themselves. It is also terrific fun.
For some years now, as an
important aspect of our publicity
College and is widely regarded as one
of Britain's top climbers.
Tues 27th Oct
Paul Munton—'The Oman Wahiba
Sands Project'
D r Munton was the Biological
Resources Director of the Royal
Geographical Society's prestigious
and multi-disciplinary expedition
which took place in 1985/86 and

contribution to the systematic study
of desert regions.

After the Ball
Thanks to all of you who attended
Monday night: I hope you enjoyed
yourselves. Don't forget to turn up to
tonight's event which should be a
stormer of a party. You would need
to be suffering from severe censory
deprivation not to know what was
happening, so I'm not going to tell
you about Rent Party, Salvation
Sunday, Crash, Tom McEwan the two
discos, jazz, late bar and films (Mad
Max and a whole lot more) that you
can catch for a mere £4.50. Instead
I'm going to tell you all about an
excellent band by the name of Circus
Circus Circus (or Circus x 3 if you
prefer) who you can see in the Lounge
on Friday 16th October. Those of you
with good memories may well
remember the band from two years
back at the Guilds Carnival. They
wore suits and ties and perforemd a
set full of band dance rhythms and
nimble foot-work. Well today the
suits have gone in favour of the look
of 87 (circa Curiosity, Wet Wet Wet)
but the music remains as does the
foot-work. With two slots in Melody
Maker in the last five weeks, one
senses they have a few people on their
side, the last single Magic Girl was
coined " a n effortless stroll of a
genuine pop single...". N o doubt
more acclaim will follow with two
more singles and an album in the next
few months so why not come along
and see for yourself. Doors open at
9pm for £1 in advance. There is a late
bar and a disco until l a m .
