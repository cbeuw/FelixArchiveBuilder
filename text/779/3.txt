Don't ask
Due to printing problems, the new
U L U Welfare Handbook was not
distributed at the Rector's Reception
this year. The Handbook was ordered
by Imperial College Union to replace
a booklet entitled But were afraid to
ask which has been issued to Freshers
in previous years.
I C U Welfare Officer Pippa Salmon
admitted that the U L U Welfare
Handbook did not cover material to
as greater depth as But were afraid to
ask, but added that it did cover more
ground including a section on
accommodation written by ex-IC
Welfare Councellor Lesley
Gillingham.

T H E newly formed Film Society has
come into conflict with IC Science

Science Fiction films.
STOIC to
return to
airwaves
STOIC, Imperial College's student

building up its o w n suite o f
broadcasting equipment. T h e
equipment, installed over the summer
includes a £6,000 digital effects
machine and a vision mixer which

folding to be performed. A teletext

offering free advertising for clubs and
societies between 9.30am and 5pm
each day. STOIC can be received in
the Union Snack Bar, Southside T V

Parsons charms IBM
UlUtravel
Major industrial sponsors, including computer giant IBM, have funded
the refurbishment of a new office for the Royal School of Mines Union.
RSMU President, Geoff Parsons, approached several companies and won
financial support for refitting the ground floor coffee room to make a
new office. In addition, RSMU Officers are hoping that IBM will provide
a personal computer for their Union Office.
The new office has been decorated and furnished to a very high standard
and is already in use. The old rooms are also being refurbished to provide
a leisure area for students. RSMU is intending to hire a pool table for
student recreation, and it is hoped that one of the industrial sponsors will
donate a television.
In return for their support, IBM will be invited to the RSM to give a
series of lectures, and the company will be taking an advertisement in
the RSM Journal. Representatives from IBM, and other patrons of RSMU,
will be attending the annual Mines Ball.
A spokesman for RSMU said that the Union was planning to raise more
money from the Mines Ball to help maintain the new facilities and for
Foreign Students Week.

Come on
down
No one has yet claimed the prize in
the Spanner draw, which took place
at the Guilds U G M on Monday. The
winning numbers are as follows:
364, 900, 352, 007, 032 and 781.
The first person to contact Dave
Tyler, bearing a copy of Spanner
containing one of these numbers, will
win £10 worth of drinks in the Union
Bar. Bill Goodwin, Spanner 1987
Editor, commented yesterday: " T h e
important thing at the moment is for
someone to come and claim the prize.
Otherwise I'm afraid I'll have to
spend the money myself."
Lock shock
Many Imperial students risk having
their cycles stolen because they are
using the wrong sort of lock.
College Security C h i e f M r
Geoffrey Reeves told F E L I X , "If you
use a chain or a cable it will be cut.
You must use a solid steel U-bend
type lock to secure your cycle to
something solid, preferably the 'toast
racks'. No one using this type of lock
has ever had a cycle stolen from
College."
College Security (Sherfield Room
150) sells these locks for £16.25. M r
Reeves also advises students to have
their postcodes stamped on their
cycles. The Metropolitan Police will
be visiting the College Security Office
this morning and later in the term to
do this for free.
It is also essential to remove
accessories such as lights and pump
when you leave your cycle. If you
have quick release hubs then you
should remove the front wheel and
lock it to the back wheel and frame.
If you have any questions about
protecting your cycle then the College
Security Office will be pleased to
advise you.
