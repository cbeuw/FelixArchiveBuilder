• I doubt if I can stand much more
of those inane Capital DJs telling me
that they've turned 'the power up'
since their format changed last week.
LBC have also changed their
programming in the last month to
include less talk and more music. M y
spies tell me that this may have
something to do with a n e w
advertising war between the two
London-based independent radio
stations. L B C have brought in such
names as Michael Aspel and Henry
Kelly to do weekend shows and have
moved Steve Allen from his popular
Weekend Night Extra to an earlier'
time of 7-9pm Fridays, Saturdays and
Sundays to host The Night is Young.
Personally, I find L B C ' s new
arrangement a bit o f a
disappointment. T h e late night
programmes lack any sort of depth
after the demise of Night Extra
making way for more tedious phone-
ins. The only advantage is that I now
find it a lot easier to get to sleep at
nights.
The B B C radio stations always have
a few programmes worth listening to.
On Saturday John Peel talks to his
producer John Walters about his
listening life (Radio One, 2pm) in
Peeling Back the Years. This week
is the third of a series concentrating
on the pre-punk years. Where have

Possessions and other Things as

• World Cup Cricket Special starts
next Monday o n Radio Three
(5.00pm on 1215kHz only). The first
match is England v Pakistan with live
commentary from Rawalpindi. I
wonder if they'll be eating cakes from
Mrs Brown, Sheffield, in Pakistan as
well?
• Radio Three repeats its look at
Einstein's most radical predictions
about the existence of gravity waves
in One Billionth of an Atom
(Monday, 9.15pm). This programme
may be slightly elementary for the
physicists amongst you but most will
be able to sympathise with Professors
Ron Drever, James Hough and
Bernard Schutz in their attempts to
measure the distance of one billionth
of an atom.
•Imperial College Radio can be very
good or very bad depending on who's
broadcasting. There are a few regular
shows but most tend to be very
'spontaneous'. Another City
(Wednesday, 11pm) appeals to the
College hippy element and Nigel on
the Wireless (Tuesday, 9pm) to the
sloppy ones. These are both seasoned
shows so they'll be no crashing the
IRN news.

• Living in hall, you will probably
find, is incredibly frustrating i f you
want to watch a particular
programme. Invariably the majority
will want to watch the other side.
Saturday morning is the best time to
monopolise the T V set while the rest
are nursing hangovers or catching up
on their sleep quota. The trouble is
that most programmes aren't worth
watching at that time of day. Except
for the wonderful Dancin' Days
(Channel Four, 11.30pm), that is.
all the punks gone? These
programmes are always spontaneous
and Peely obviously enjoys talking to
John Walters so it's always fun.
• Also on Saturday, Radio Four
broadcasts Radio Active: its highly
successful radio parody (12.25pm).
This week the radio station carries a
Probably one of the worst soaps I
have every watched but compulsive
watching due to the bad dubbing—it
was made in Brazil—and bad acting.
The pace is incredibly slow but it's
a scream!
• "Football's a funny old game" and
other such gems from the mouth of
Jimmy Greaves, ex-football and ex-
alcoholic, can be heard when he
partners Ian St John on Saturday for
Saint & Greavsie (ITV, 1.05pm).
It's mostly football talk but it's worth
watching just for Greavsie's one
liners!
• Saturday evening contains the
dilemma of whether to oggle at Jerry

MUSIC
Hall on the Dame Edna Experience
(ITV, 10.30pm), watch vintage
Monty Python (BBC, 10.45pm), or
St Elsewhere (Channel F o u r ,
10.00pm) followed by Saturday
Almost Live (Channel F o u r ,
11.00pm).
Sunday's highlight is a brand new
Clive James on Television (ITV,
9pm) and is probably the only thing
worth watching that day, apart from
Eastenders (BBC1, 2pm) and the
Peter Seller's film Battle of the Sexes
(BBC1, 3pm).
• World Cup Cricket (BBC1,
12.05pm) on Monday takes over from
the live Radio 3 coverage and shows
the closing stages of Pakistan v
England. Later on that evening there's
a new sereis o f Brush Strokes
(BBC1, 8pm) whose best feature is
the Dexy's Midnight Runners intro
music. Also Doctor Who (BBC1,
7.35pm) with that hideous Bonnie
Langford and another chance to see
the Cricket at 6.35pm (BBC2).
• Other pgorammes not to miss
include the latest in Eastenders
(Tuesday, Thursday, 7.30pm BBC1)
American Football (Channel Four,
Tuesday, 10pm), and the new series
of Alas Smith and Jones (BBC2,
Thursday, 9pm).

(1.00am—2.00am Monday morning,

concert o f a life-time with the

Jim Jiminee
Mean Fiddler, Sun 27th Sept
Thrown into action by several good
reviews in the press and the
knowledge that the band were playing
in College fairly soon I set off to see
Jim Jiminee (what a simply awful
name) at my favourite LoifdoflVenue
The Mean Fiddler. Things did not go
quite to plan as the man on the door
tried to make me pay. Lost for words,
I reached deep into my pocket and
pulled out my F E L I X Press Card.
'That will do nicely, Sir' was the cry
as I strolled into the venue. I was not
quite sure what to expect but, from
the moment this band hit the stage,
one could see they were very special.
They started at a speed which left
most of us standing, jumping and
jiving as they waved their rhythmic
way through the first few numbers to
the delight of the audience and
themselves. People have compared
them to the House Martins but they
looked better, danced better and
laughed better. In fact there is little
cause for comparison, bar the tongue
in cheak acapella song during which
the drummer terrorised the audience
with his tamborine. The set ended all
too soon with a jem of a single
Thursday (if you can't dance to it then
your feet must be nailed to the floor).
They made me jump, they made me
swing but most of all they made me
smile. Snap them up!
