Big Trouble in Little C h i n a
Thurs 15th Oct, 7.00pm,
Mech Eng 220. Admission to

(membership available at door).
An action-adventure-ghost-story-
comedy-kung-fu film, directed and
written by John Carpenter (Star Man,
Assault on Precinct 13, Dark Star,
The Fog, Halloween, The Thing).
Trucker Jack Burton is swept
purely by chance into the most bizarre
and perilous adventure of his life.
Jack thinks he's been everything—
but even he couldn't have dreamed
this one up!
He finds himself battling
supernatural martial arts warriors,
subterranean monsters, and a
2000-year old magician, the evil
David Lo Pan, who needs to sacrifice
a woman with green eyes to free
himself from an ancient curse.
Don't miss this spectacular film!

Unconditional
release
All around the world there are people
in prison for what they believe:
prisoners of conscience. They are not
dangerous men and women—none of
them advocate violence. However the
Government doesn't like their
opinions and has cast them into jail.
In Prisoner of Conscience Week
Amnesty International is seeking to
place a special emphasis on the
victims of Government repression.
You can participate in this campaign
by simply writing a letter.
Orlando Rodriguez, who was
kidnapped by security forces in
Guatemala in 1980, was illegally
arrested and has not yet been brought
before a court of law. His detention
came about solely because of his
legitimate trade union activities and
therefore Amnesty is calling for his
immediate unconditional release.
Please write a brief, courteous letter
appealing for the release of Orlando
Rodriguez to:
Presidence Vinicio Cerezo
Arevalo
Presidente de la Republica de
Guatemala
Palacio Nacional Guatemala

International and how you can fight

Coming to
terms
The group regrets the loss of Andy
Bannister, one of its founder
members. He has now left the College
for this year at least and we all greatly
appreciate the groundwork he did for
us last year.
Meanwhile our weekly meetings
will occur on Wednesday at 12.30pm
in the Green Committee Room (top
floor of the Union Building). Anyone
is welcome gay/straight, male/female.
Please come along and discover that
we don't have horns or wear dresses.
I suspect we will be more a social
group than campaign group this year
and our principle aim is to help people
come to terms with their sexuality. I
think its imperitive to remove the veil
of lies and deceit and be open about
the issue. What's more your straight
friends will probably admire you a lot
more especially if they suspect
anyway.
For those who prefer more
anonymity, the U L U group meets on
Thursdays at 7.30pm in the U L U
building in Malet Street. It is being
run by Robert Daniels this year—a
former student of this college. This
group is very much bigger than our
group and so has lots of speakers and
larger diversity of people (not just
grey-minded scientists).
Finally I can be contacted
confidentially via the Department of
Computing pigeonholes in room 219
of the Huxley Building. That's all for
now.

Welcome Workshop
New arrivals and visiting sabbatical
staff are warmly invited to a
'Welcome Workshop' on October
14th, 9.30am to 4pm in the Rector's
flat at 170 Queen's Gate. Organised
by the IC Women's Club, the
workshop is designed to present the
human face of IC as swiftly as
possible to new arrivals,
postgraduates, R A s , staff, visiting
academics and all their parents.
Workshop small group sessions
with invited speakers and slides will
explore how to make optimum use of
being at IC and living in London. A
home-made lunch will include
introduction to the sports and health
centres. Afternoon sessions will cover
crafty tips from the post-grads on how
to live on an emaciated budget and
travel safely alone at night. The aim
is that everyone should go away not
only informed but with phone
numbers of people living in the same
neighbourhood or sharing the same
interests.
Intended mainly, although not
exclusively for women, the workshop
hopes to open doors to both existing
facilities and those that can be created
in response to demand, such as
exercise and language classes and
other forms of continuing education.
Pre-booking is essential for
catering. Register now by ringing
3021 or send a note to Sherfield Room
543. Join us for lunch, tea, coffee and
as much of the day as you can
manage.
