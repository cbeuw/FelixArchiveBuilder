F E L I X
Due to, production problems I have
found myself in the Imperial College
Union General Meeting having to
write an editorial. The meeting is
about to start and there are 112
people. For those of you who don't
know, the quorum of our U G M s is
300. I find the lack of interest in the
Union pathetic. Each year I have
watched the attendance diminish.
Eons ago, when I was a mere first
year, the first U G M I attended was
well publicised and quorate. If you
are a first year and didn't attend I
would be interested to receive a letter
on why you had something better to
do. Did you know there was a U G M
yesterday? Why aren't you interested
in your Union?
Flanning
In this edition we have on opinion
article from Nigel Baker, Rag
Chairman and a letter from Dave
Tyler, C & G U President, about the
Hitsquad flanning at the Freshers'
Reception on Monday. Nobody,
however, seems to have mentioned
the damage done to I C U due to the
violent behaviour of the Deputy
President and Honorary Secretary.
This violence was inexcusable and
unnecessary. No wonder Freshers
don't want to attend the General
Meetings.
Censorship
A motion was brought to the Imperial
FELIX STAFF MEETING
There will be a meeting today for all
FELIX staff or those interested in joining
our team at 1.00pm in the FELIX
Office, Beit Quadrangle. Everybody is
welcome to attend. Free coffee on offer
to the first twenty lucky recipients
College U G M yesterday which aimed
to give Editorial freedom to the
Handbook Editor. After a quarter of
an hours re-hashing an amended
version was presented which was
eventually referred back to the next
U G M . A s the present policy stands,
an 'external' publication must be
censored by the sabbaticals,
publications board chairman and its
editor and 'external' publication is
defined not in terms of its intended
readership, but where it is printed!
This is plainly stupid. Clearly the
present policy needs to be changedâ€”if
only to redefine an external
publication.
Entertainments
I'd just like to take advantage of this
space to congratulate John Noble,
I C U Entertainments Chairman, on the
great events he's organised this week
and for the coming term. Despite M r
Howgate's comments last week, I
think John's done an excellent job and
the bands he booked are much more
exciting live than any maga-band.
Michael Arthur
M r Arthur would like me to make it
clear that he did not forget to add
V A T on to summer letting bills and
that certain Summer Accommodation
people must have read his figures
wrongly in order to come to that
conclusion.
FELIX
I believe that the last issue was well-
received but I can never be sure as
I seem to receive very little feed-back.
I welcome constructive criticism from
all F E L I X readers, not only those
mentioned in these pages. I'm very
flexible. If you don't like a particular
feature or want to see something new;
again, please tell me. The main point
given about the last issue was that
most of you thought it was too big!
I can only say that there is no pleasing
some people.
Sport
When I stood for the post of F E L I X
Editor, one of my main aims was to
revive the F E L I X sports page. I now
have two Sports Editors and
photographers keen to take sporting
pictures. A l l I need now is the
cooperation of all the sports clubs and
submitted results every Wednesday
night. I cannot provide a proper sports
service otherwise.
