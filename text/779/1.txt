Imperial College Union is set to gain control of the profits from the gravel
extraction at Harlington sports ground—a move which will net the Union
an estimated £3m. The money will be held by an independent trust which
will invest the money on the Union's behalf, yielding a possible return
of £400,000 per annum. The proceeds will be used to finance a new sports
complex at South Kensington.
The decision was taken at a meeting
of the College Finance and Executive
Committee on September 15th, when
the Union presented historical
evidence demonstrating that the
profits from Harlington belong to the
Union not the College. Until recently
the College investments Committee
had been holding the money in a bank
account, the interest from which had
been siphoned off to ease the
College's cash flow problems.
After three months o f Union
research it was revealed that the
proceeds from the gravel should have
been invested by the Investments
Committee for "the improvement of
student facilities i n South
Kensington". It also became apparent
that the income should have been
controlled by the College Athletics
Committee on which the Union has
majority representation, and not the
College's Finance and Executive
Committee.
These findings were accepted by
the Finance and Executive meeting in
Septenber and the I C U President is
currently negotiationg with College
Secretary John Smith to decide how
the money should best be invested.
Because of the Union's charitable
status, half of the money can be
placed i n low risk speculative
investments, whilst the remainder
must be spent on steady growth
investments such as unit trust share
holdings.

A body of former students and
members of the Governing Body will
be placed in charge of the trust to
invest the funds on behalf of the
Union. The Union hope that the trust
will be chaired by former I C U
President Ian B u l l , now an
engineering project manager, who has
already expressed a strong interest in
the proposal. Under the terms of the
trust, the Union will be able to spend
the returns from the investments, and
will also withdraw lump sums for the

The penthouse flat of the Tizard and
Selkirk warden was broken onto last
Sunday. This was the first of three
burglaries in Southside so far this
term. Two handbags containing credit
cards were stolen fron D r
Hutchinson's flat, which was entered
by the window.
About £60 was also taken from
Falmouth Keogh Assistant
Subwarden A l Birch's room later in
the week. M r Birch had complained
in January about a broken window
catch, but no action had been taken.
When asked about the incident, M r
Birch commented "I hope it will
provide the impetus to improve
security in Southside". His window
is now screwed shut.
A lock had recently been fitted i n
the inner entrance doors o f the
building, but it was found to be
disabled each night before the
burglaries. Security guards denied
turning off the lock.
purchases such as the sports hall, with
the proviso the cash is later repaid
back into the trust.
In an interview with F E L I X
yesterday President Ian Howgate
praised John Smith f o r h i s
cooperation i n the affair. H e
explained that he had been unwilling
to tell F E L I X details o f the
proceedings without the go-ahead
from M r Smith as he felt this would
prejudice the negotiations.
