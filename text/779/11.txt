The puritan ideal of banning all
alcoholic liquor in the American
1920s also gave rise to one of the
world's more famous ganglords; A l
Capone. Charismatic in public and in
private utterly ruthless, 'Scarface'
Capone (Robert De Niro) owned
Chicago, from his lucrative monopoly
on illicit booze to the chief of police;
everyone had their price. Until, that
is, the arrival of one Eliot Ness
(Kevin Costner) a federal agent who
swore to 'get' Capone. Ness, together
with a small number of hand-picked
officers earned their title by being
incorruptible and therefore out of
Capone's control. Here the story
departs from truth—the only thing
Brian De Palma's version has in
common with Ness' own account of
events is the name. This however,
should not prevent enjoyment of this
high-budget action-filled version of
the famous story; which incidentally
launched another film and television
series of the same name that is
currently being repeated.
Despite the reworking of the true
Capone story, many of the major
Hellraiser
A small aesthetically pleasing cube of
oriental origin finds its way into the
possession of Frank (Andrew
Robinson), a man with a rather
sadistic nature. Along with the cube
Frank gains access to the pleasures of
heaven or hell (his preference being
the latter) accompanied by a brigade
of very odd beings, 'The Cenobites',
to keep an eye on him.
Frank's passion for the more
painful and tortuous ways of having
fun leads him to a thoroughly bloody
and sticky end until a few drops of
his brother Larry's (Ashley Laurence)
blood revitalises his decaying body
and he forces himself up through the
gaps in the floorboards of the spare
bedroom a mere skeleton (and slimy
bits) of his former self. In the search
for human flesh, which he needs to
make his body whole again, he enlists
his sister-in-law Julia, who seems to
find compatible but slightly un-
cooperative donors for Frank's
interesting style of body-building.
When Kirsty (Clare Higgins), Larry's
Daughter, discovers what's been
going on in her dad's house she too
becomes pursued by the Cenobites.
This film took me slightly by
surprise when I went to the preview
expecting a teen-movie, fortunately it
was shown during the morning as this
is the sort of film that makes me check
under my bed at night and has me
looking over my shoulder when
driving home from the cinema. The
Cenobites are pretty ghastly but I
think the award for best make-up has
to go to the half skin-clad Frank the
earlier animated Frank is pretty
damned clever too. The best horror
film I've seen outranking The Thing.
R.A.
features are there; notably the lavish
meal where Capone graphically
demonstrates the finer points of
baseball, and the consequences of
failure. Where the story departs from
fact is in the henchmen that Ness
recruits; Malone (Sean Connery) is a
wisened cop of the old guard, George
Stone (Andy Garcia) as the prodigy
rookie and the unlikely accountant
looking into Capone's plentiful
income played by Charles Martin
Smith.
De Niro is masterful in his
portrayal of Capone; the explosive
character learned from Raging Bull
combined with the charisma from
Once Upon a Time in America form
an imposing portrayal of the villain.
Connery's Malone has a problem with
his Irish accent which quickly reverts
to his native Scottish, but this should
not be allowed to spoil a dynamic
supporting role which almost steals
the show.
In the end De Palma's production
brings new life to a popular story
giving it a superior finish with lavish
settings for an often violent subject.

The Night is Young
The Tragic and complex life of Alex
(Denis Lavant), a young man who
becomes involved with the Parisian
underworld after the death of his
father, is seen against the harsh and
depressing streets of Paris. Alex had
previously made his living as a street
gambler but decides to take the place
of his father in a plot to steal a life-
saving serum (similar to a cure for
AIDS) from a chemical company. His
two accomplices are seen as tired old
men one of whom Marc (Michel
Piccoli) has a young lover, Anna
(Juliette Binoche). Alex falls in love
with Anna and this is where Leos
Carax's moody direction comes into
its own with some sensitive and
amusing scenes. A n exciting car chase
leads to a very appropriate if
somewhat violent climax.
Don't be put off by the fact that this
film is subtitled as very little of the
appeal is in the spoken word but more
in the atmosphere captured by the
Director
