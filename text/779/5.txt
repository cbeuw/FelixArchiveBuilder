"I have joined one but it's not definite at the moment, because

haven't done it for a long time. Also Environmental Society

I wish there was an Anarchist Club.
I could start one but can you see 20 anarchists in this
room?"—Sean

we had the time then yes,
definitely, but there's no
way we've got the
time"—Bettine and Zilla

vaguely interested i n "
