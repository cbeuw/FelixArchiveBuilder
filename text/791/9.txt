world, that is surely no reason to ban
the Chinese people from using them.
Street goods in China are cheap and
shoddy, but quality goods and objets
d'art including replica antiques are
sold in special shops known as
Friendship Stores. These only accept
FEC so you don't have to be a genius
to work out that the Chinese people
aren't allowed in. Westerners and
prosperous looking (ie overseas or
Hong Kong) orientals walk straight
in, but I actualy saw a security guard
throw out a local who had sneaked up
the steps. It goes on—the best
restaurants and hotels only accept
F E C You can't buy a first class train
ticket with Yuan; it is no wonder that
there is a thriving black market, or
that a westerner cannot walk the
streets without being approached by
someone offering large amounts of
Yuan per FEC.
You can try to justify this cruelty-
China's massive trade deficit means
that it has to earn money from
tourism, while keeping its people fed
and clothed. Street life in China is
remarkably cheap; tourism expensive,
but if you don't like forms of
apartheid, stay out of present day
Beijing!
Train travel in China is not for the
fainthearted, either. On trains hitting
a maximum of 40 mph, you rattle
along in an appallingly small and
dingy 4-berthed cabin for at least 24
hours; in the dining car you can watch
the insects move from the wastebin
to your food and that's first class.
Another word to the w a r y -
westerners are still a novelty,
especially western females, so be
prepared to be stared at. We slept
with our shoes on.
Shanghai and Guangzhou were an
improvement on Beijing, being more
westernised—hints of capitalism, such
as neon advertisements, are visible
here. Unfortunately we were by this
time heartily sick of China, so we
made it our main goal to sample the
excellent Chinese cuisine.
It is very difficult to manage on
your own in China. Outside Beijing
hardly anyone speaks English and the
Chinese do not go out of their way
to help—understandable, considering
the resentment we must cause in
them. There is also a severe hotel
shortage in Shanghai, so unless you
want to trudge round the city all day
with two rucksacks, book first.
After China, Bangkok and the Thai
people were a much needed tonic.
The Thais are overwhelmingly
friendly, inquisitive and helpful.
Bangkok may have a lousy reputation
and it is certainly the dirtiest city I've
seen, but it is vivid and cheerful. I
wouldn't risk the market stall food
again though—I was sick six times in
24 hours, once in a tuk tuk (electric
taxi) hurtling through the streets of
Bangkok.
But we needed a rest, and Bangkok,
with its magnificent temples, jewelled
- . a i t !
and delight of Koh Samui.
Here, we hired a beach hut,
hammock included, for about £2 a
night. We sunbathed on the almost
deserted golden beaches, and swam
in a sea so clear you could see your
toes. During the day we drank
:
Wmm
Buddhas and noisy nightlife certainly
wasn't that, so we headed down South
(on a modern train this time) to Koh
Samui.
Much has been written about this
beautiful island which lies just off the
coast of the mainland, but nothing can
ever get across the beauty, simplicity
buckets of iced fruit milkshakes and
ate coconut. At night we ate shark
steaks or gorgeously hot Thai curries
beneath the palm trees.
One day we hired a motorbike for
£8 and rode all the way around the
island, visiting the exquisite waterfalls
inland.
Admittedly Koh Samui is filled
with Europeans, but definitely of the
young weatherbeaten type, not the
Club 18-30 mob. Yes—Koh Samui is
paradise on Earth, but for God's sake
go there before they build the
airports! I'm going back this year if
the overdraft can take it.
The majority of the flights were
with China airlines—a Taiwan based
group which I would thoroughly
recommend, the food was excellent
and drinks were frequent and free,
although admittedly I was bored sick
of the safety film by the nth flight! I
also enjoyed flying with K L M (Dutch
airlines) and good old BA. I was,
however, seriously worried when we
flew to Peking with CAAC—the
plane was like a cattle truck and the
stewardesses ignored everyone.
American Airlines was a con—they
wanted $8 for the headphones.
