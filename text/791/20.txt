No Tyler, no comment
Dave Tyler, City & Guilds Union
President, announced his resignation
on Wednesday because of the results.
of a questionnaire on Tuesday. He
later withdrew his resignation, saying
that he would go on strike for a week.
The Questionnaire deals with
various issues concerning College,
Industrial Sponsorship and Careers
and City & Guilds Union. In response
to the question 'Is Dave Tyler a good
President?' a 2-1 majority of the 160
or so replies received so far has
indicated a negative feeling. It seems
that 2nd Lieutenant Tyler took these
results to heart and resigned only to
reconsider his option soon after.
Dave Hudson, the editor of
Guildsheet felt that the results,
concerning the now infamous, CCU
President were of little importance
and possibly unconstructive. T think
it would be very sad if Dave Tyler
ended his Presidency by resigning
over this' he said. He went on to say:
'One thing you always have to
remember is that students are always
very negative'.
Although he no longer intends to
resign, 2nd Lieutenant Tyler did say
that, if over 100 of the replies
received are negative, he will put the
matter of his self-deposition to vote
at the next Guilds or IC U G M ,
whichever is the sooner. Although the
results were unfavourable for 2nd
Lieutenant Tyler personally, he felt
that the questionnaire results did seem
to indicate that a majority still feel
'Guilds is worth while', although
badly run and poorly led.
Most well known for his numerous
misdemenours last term, 2nd
Lieutenant Tyler claims to have been
thinking of resigning for some time;
if he carries out his threat, and the
results so far seem to point to a strong
possibility of at least 100 negative
replies.
Staff support

resigned from her post on Tuesday.
Ms Salmon stood down for academic

Pippa has resigned. She hasn't done
as much as some other officers, but
I haven't given her as much support
as I have other Union officers'. Mr
Howgate went on to encourage other
students to apply for the post and

Union was not a prerequisite. He was
