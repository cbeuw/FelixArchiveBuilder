Entertaining Mr S

Widely acclaimed
as one of the
best
Entertainments
Chairmen in
recent times,
John Noble has
been the focus of
attention since
Freshers Week.
His wry sense of
humour and his
enthusiasm for
his job has made
him one of the
most pleasant of
Union officers to
work with.
FELIX took time
out to talk to him
about his
achievements,
disasters, life,
loves, music
influences and
his plans for the
future.
John has been one of the most
successful Entertainments Chairmen
in recent times. He has developed an
uncanny knack for plucking good,
popular bands out of the hundreds
offered to him by agents throughout
the UK: bands like Voice of the
Beehive, the Real Sounds Of Africa
and Jim Jiminee. John considers his
greatest achievement to be 'the selling
out of this year's Carnival 88 although
the Real Sounds Of Africa came a
very close second.'
John was born in Ashington on the
edge of Northumberland. He admits
to going through both state and
private education. He is quick to add
that he prefered his state school. His
private prep school had told his
parents that they thought he was
educationally subnormal. John,
however, shows no signs of this
diagnosis at Imperial where he is
currently completing a degree in
Chemical Engineering. 'I didn't like
my prep school. They made you wear
shorts until you were thirteen. And
I didn't like that at all!'
He believes that his northern
upbringing gave him his wry humour
and that he was heavily influenced by
the Northern friendship which he
discovered in his sixth form. T have
loved music and entertainment all my
life and I suspect I always will. But
above all I like doing things and-
working with people. Ents is
amazing. You learn so much like
management, promotion and so on.
But the most important thing this year
has been the sense of unity and
purpose.'
John is not an easy person to
describe. He sees himself as 'very shy
and a wee bit insecure.' If this is true,
he manages to conceal it very well.
'I'm also a rather harsh person, but
only with the ones I love!' He is not
conceited or vain, as such, but admits
to 'not being the most humble of
people', despite his strenuous
attempts to rectify that situation.
'Managing to remain so completely
and utterly humble whilst at the same
time suffering much public adoration
is not only a great achievement but
also a completely fictious state of
being!'
John also revealed that he was
undergoing a fitness programme since
discovering that he liked eating food
too much. He had resolved to diet it
away in the new year but he didn't
have the willpower. T do enjoy a few
small beers every now and again.'
He is keen to mention his
achievements but when questioned on
his failures his only reply is that he
will never be a popstar. He was
briefly in a College band called Blue
Blue Ice, formed by a few friends,
which subsequendy died a death when
several members left last year. 'When
I was young I was very into The
Police and Japan. My tastes have
altered since then. At the moment I
listen to the Christians, Blow
Monkeys, Hip Sway and the Justified
Ancients of Mu Mu.'
As far as John's future goes, he is
trying to get into Research/
Development before heading into
management in either his own
company or 'some ethical
organisation, if any exist.'
John also has plans for College
entertainments. 'We've organised a
Fifties night which should be
excellent value. Also we're planning
an Indie night, maybe some Heavy
Rock and a Reggae band featuring
Basil Gabbidon from Steel Pulse. The
final highlight of the year will be the
Rag Ball next term. We've got some
really excellent bands planned for that
one!'
It is easy to see why Ents has been
so successful under John's leadership.
Unlike previous Chairmen he has
remained dedicated to his job and still
maintains the same enthusiasm which |
first spurred him into standing for the
post. Let us hope that next year's
Chairman will be able to live up to
the standards set by this year's.
