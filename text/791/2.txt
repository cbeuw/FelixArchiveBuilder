Welcome to the first of a series of
'special' issues which will be running
over the next few weeks. This is our
Student Travel issue. It is a little on
the small size due to lack of finances
in the FELIX coffers but it contains
a personal account of a trip around the
world, youth hostelling and
interrailing.
We are planning a special 'Comic
Relief issue next week to coincide
with Comic Relief Day. A l l your
special College officials will be
donning their red noses and the whole
issue will be incredibly tongue-in-
cheek. This means that we will only
include articles and reports which fit
in with the general 'feel' of the issue.
You have been warned.
I must apologise for the lack of a
SciTech page in this issue, but Steve
Black has been ill for the past week.
He has promised me that the page will
return as soon as he is well again.
Council horror
I left Monday's Council completely
disillusioned with the Union anfl the
running thereof. I could not believe
that Ian Howgate's report, which
contained proposals for the biggest
Union shake-up in years, was passed.
His proposals for the three Union
sabbaticals were ill-conceived and
misguided. He has effectively created
a new sabbatical post and thrown one
away in just one Council. Why does
it only require one Council meeting
(only members can vote) to
completely change the way a Union
is run and a Union General Meeting
(any Union member can vote) to
adopt Bungle, Zippy and George as
mascots?
I think what concerned me most
was that the meeting was so badly
handled by the Chairman Alistair
Seymour. With such a major subject
to discuss, he should have first
allowed debate on whether we needed
such a drastic reorganisation of the
Union. Instead he allowed petty
squabbles over wording of job
descriptions. Had Mr Howgate
consulted with other Unions which
had tried creating a sabbatical to run
entertainments, he would have
discovered that all have failed.
Aberystwyth is a case in point. They
found that the only people who stood
for the post were those concerned
with self-promotion and freebie-
hunting. Their entertainments were
worse than before the change. In the
end they appointed a permanent
member of staff as Entertainments
Officer with the brief that his wages
would be paid for out of the profits,
and if there were no profits, then he
wouldn't get paid! However, we have
now been landed with a sabbatical
position to organise events.
I am also worried triat the Union
hasn't used this opportunity to create
a sabbatical with special responsibility
for the College sites at Silwood and
now St Mary's Medical School. St
Mary's don't have any sabbatical
officers and are in danger of being left
out of the Union activities if there is
no sabbatical officer who is prepared
to travel between sites and encourage
integration. Do you really think that
St Mary's students will trek all the
way over to IC just to attend a UGM?
Not even most Civil Engineers are
prepared to walk to the JCR to do
that!
I would urge all Council members
to think twice about these new job
descriptions and to amend them at the
next opportunity. I would also suggest
that once a decision has finally been
made about the Union, that it is no
longer left to Council to change but
that, like Union by-laws, job
description changes have to go
through two consecutive UGMs
before being accepted. Every member
of the Union should be able to have
a say on this subject.
Guildsheet questionnaire
I think that this questionnaire was so
clever. I wish that I'd asked the same
question as to whether people wanted
Ian Howgate as their President or not.
Perhaps he would have tried to resign
as well.
Printing
There is too much printing work
floating about this College to be fitted
into the Union Print Unit's busy
schedule. I am also being asked to
produce St Mary's publicity. Perhaps
it is time for a big shake-up in the
FELIX Office. This means that I am
unable to take on any personal
printing work for the forseeable
future. Sorry.
Collation
Collation is the subtle art of putting
FELIX together every Thursday
night. A l l four thousand copies.
Recently we have seen the number of
collators drop due to third year
projects and finals approaching. I
would like to encourage more first
years to give up an hour on Thursday
evenings to help us with this
mammoth task, particularly those
who live in Beit Hostel. It's a chance
to see FELIX before the rest of
College does or before the Guilds
President tries to steal it again! It's
not a particularly exciting job, but
there are soft drinks on hand and
you'll get a credit in FELIX to say
thank you.
Finally...
There will be a special staff meeting
in the Union Snack Bar today,
1.00pm, to discuss next week's issue.
Anybody is welcome to come. Mars
Bars obligatory.
