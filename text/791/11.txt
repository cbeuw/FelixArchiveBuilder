MALLEI
Giselle
Giselle is still regarded by many
people as the greatest ballet of all
time. It originates from the nineteench
century, when ballet first became well
known and widely popular; especially
romantic ballet. The story is simple
but effective, created by the French
poet Theophile Gautier, who wrote
the scenario (based on a theme by
Heinrich Heine) as a starring vehicle
for the young ballerina Carlotta Grisi.
Giselle, a simple peasant girl, falls
in love with a nobleman, Albrecht,
who pretends to be a peasant boy,
Loys. The truth is revealed by
Hilarion, who is also in love with
Giselle, and consequently madly
jealous of Albrecht. Albrecht is
forced to admit that he must return to
his fiancee, the Pricess Bathilde. At
this point the ballet can go in either
of two directions; either, Gizelle dies
of a broken heart, or she stabs herself,
depending on the production and the
ballerina's preference. The Royal
Ballet follow the latter pathway,
sensibly avoiding the heavily over-
melodramatic atmosphere that the
former would produce. Giselle's
taking of her own life increases the
stature of her love for Albrecht and
the extent of her hurt at his deception;
having her die of a broken heart
would simply make her a pawn with
no control over her life and thus
making little dramatic impact.
After the deception and heartbreak
of the first act, we are transported in
the second to Giselle's graveside.
Albrecht, filled with remorse, visits.
However, Giselle has been
transformed into a 'Wili', a spirit of
the night, haunting the woods and
obliged to lure men to dance until they
are exhausted and die. The other
Wilis kill Hilarion in this way, and
the icy Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis,
forces Giselle to attempt the same
thing with the mourning Albrecht. But
he is saved, first by sheltering under
the cross on Giselle's grave and then
being protected by dancing with
Giselle, who defies the ghosts of other
jilted girls who have condemned
Albrecht to death. Dawn arrives, and
Giselle returns to her grave, leaving
Albrecht to weep and repent.
The Royal Ballet's Giselle is
very coherent—the story is clear, and
every attempt has been made to make
it plausible. What must be
remembered is that it is all ultra-
romanticism, the battle of love and
faith against class distinctions,
jealouy, the mystic forces of evil, and
even death itself. And it works
excellently in the theatre. Even if
Albrecht is only toying with Giselle
in the first act, his whimsy is turned
to undying love by her death.
The role of Giselle has been
described as the Hamlet of ballet; it
calls for a combination of dramatic
ability, charm, personality and
dancing skill, and the Royal Ballet's
Lesley Collier has all of these. In the
first act she suggests complete
infatuation with Albrecht, displaying
a nervous intensity and extreme
sensitivity that makes her suicide
wholly believable and justifiable. In
the second act she jumps high and
lands silently, like a spirit, combining
ghostliness with concern and devotion
for Albrecht. Stephen Jefferies as
Albrecht is also excellent, especially
in the jumps and exhausted falls of the
second act.
Giselle is worth going to see, even
if it's the first and last time you ever
go to the ballet. You'll see one of the
finest ballets ever devised, and a great
performance of it. It's showing at the
Royal Opera House in Covent
Garden; the dates are Friday Jan 29
at 7.30pm, Friday Feb 5 at 7.30 and
Monday Feb 8 at 7.30.

BOOKl
I Write What I Like
Steve Blko—Penguin
This is a series of articles written by
one of South Africa's leading
campaigners against apartheid.
It is a very serious book, written by
someone who risked detention and
indeed can even be said to have died
as a result of these writings.
It is , therefore, not really a book
for someone who does not have much
knowledge of the situation in South
Africa, or who is not dedicated to
gaining such knowledge.
Having said that, if it is read, the
reader will be struck by the eloquence
of the writing and by the messages put
across.

South African Dispatches
Donald Woods—Penguin
This book helps give an idea of the
situation in South Africa ten years
ago. It is a collection of newspaper
articles written for one of South
Africa's leading anti-apartheid
newspapers.
It is a poignant book, in which the
pretentions and absurdities of the then
South African government have been
cacerated with a razor-sharp wit and
clinically incisive analysis.
Despite the political overtones,
however, it is an extraordinarily easy
book to read which would captivate
even the most ignorant of people.
It is in short, wry, witty, straight
to the point and well worth reading.

Between the Woods
and the Water
by Patrick Fermor—Penguin
In 1933, aged 18, Patrick Leigh
Fermor set out to walkfromthe Hook
of Holland to the Iron Gates on the
Rumanian-Yugoslav border. The first
part of his tale is recounted in A Time
for Gifts. His second book magically
reveals the journey through mountains
and plains, and tells of the many
different people he met. A night with
gypsies he felt sure would slit his
throat and take his borrowed horse
was very different from the weeks he
spent enjoying life as a guest of a
castle owner. In every chapter we
relive a new experience, experiences
of the ancient ways of life that were
soon all to be swept away and lost
forever, except in records such as
this. A remarkable travel book of
central Europe before the war.

STILL PLA Yim
Bigfoot and the Hendersons—A
standard Spielbergian all-American
family encounter with the legendary
Bigfoot, and soon he's one of the
family. Revoltingly cute, but
entertaining nevertheless.
Cry Freedom—Ostensibly the tale of
Steve Biko, but ends up being the
story of newspaper editor Donald
Woods, who became a personal friend
of the black activist. An excellent
film, the riot and police scenes
probably giving the most realistic idea
of what it's like to actually live in
South Africa and be a victim of
apartheid.
Sammy and Rosie Get Laid—Some
funny stuff in the film from the same
team that brought you My Beautiful
Laundrette, but the story wanders a
bit, and gets too disjointed in parts.
Spaceballs—The Star Wars trilogy
gets a good going over from Mel
Brooks. Contains joke upon joke,
perhaps too puerile/juvenile for
mature tastes.
Predator—Stars Arnold
Howdoyouspellit. 'Nuff said.
The Dead—John Huston's film, based
on the short story by James Joyce.
Essential viewing.
Fatal Attraction—The film that
supposedly cut the adultery rate in
America by some phenomenal figure.
If it did, it's for the wrong reasons.
As a moral tale, it stinks. As a thriller
entertainment, it's okay.
The Glass Menagerie—Directed by
Paul Newman, from the play by
Tennessee Williams. The acting is
superb, but perhaps the film is a bit
too serious for most cinemagoers.
Housekeeping—Bill Forsyth shifts
from sharp wit to even sharper drama
in this film about two sisters and their
life after their mother commits
suicide.
Innerspace—The latest Joe
Dante/Steven Spielberg collaboration,
good high speed action/comedy.
