HP8

by Adrian Grainger
Although this is the day of the fourth
round of the FA Cup, five of
London's first division clubs are
away, so that leaves just two cup
games in the city. I had a complaint
last week that I had been unfair to
Mill wall. I cannot print what the two
Millwall fans said but I apologise if
I was too harsh on their club. I must
say though that these previews are my
own opinion and if anyone has
anything to say or would like me to
say something special about a certain
club, then I would be grateful for a
message through the Maths
pigeonholes. The previews are mainly
for neutral fans who would like to go
to a game on the following Saturday.
The fans of the particular teams will
go regardless of what I say. If I think
that a certain game might be boring
or there is a chance of crowd trouble,
I will say so and leave it to the
judgement of each spectator. Enough
said.
QPR vs West Ham Utd
Loftus Road (Shepherds Bush tube)
This is the sort of tie that the Cup
often throws up, a game between two
of London's top teams whose only
chance of a trophy this year lies in this
competition. Two weeks ago there
was a dress rehearsal of this game in
the league and QPR were by far the
better team for most of the game, but
not finding the net. A goal by Alan
Dickens 15 minutes from time gave
the Hammers an unexpected bonus of
3 points. QPR have signed a brilliant
defender in Paul Parker from Fulham
and his flair, along with that of,
among others, Wayne Fereday, have
made QPR a side to fear. West Ham
liked the plastic pitch and became the
first team to win three games in a row
there on this surface. Tony Gale is
back for West Ham and is providing
the required height, especially at
corners. Brady is in form with neat
skills and nifty runs. It is often said
that the side who wins in the league
goes on to lose in the Cup, but I think
that a draw is the most likely result.
The game is 'all ticket' but it will
probably be possible to obtain tickets
on Friday or even Saturday.
Brentford vs Grimsby
Griffen Park (Brentford Central BR)
This Third Division match pairs a side
in the promotion race against one
which looks like it will go down.
Brentford are having a good season
and with a push near the end of the
season, they could climb up a league.
They have former Spurs captain Steve
Perryman in their side and he is
proving a real inspiration. Grimsby
had asperations of Division One
football a few years ago but things
have turned sour since then. They do
have former Portsmouth striker Scott
McGarvey in their side though.
Brentford should pick up maximum
points.
All games are on Saturday January
30, kick off is 3pm.
Leyton Orient vs
Nottingham Forest
Brisbane Road (Leyton tube)
The real essence of the Cup is
captured in this match. When the
name of the Division One team came
out of the hat (or rather velvet bag),
a tingle was felt by the 'O's' manager
Frank Clark. The ex-Forest player
was called by Brian Clough 'the man
who I would most like to take over
at the City Ground when I retire'
Cloughie is 52, so he still has a few
years left in him!! Orient are second
in Division Four and coupled with the
Cup are having a great season.
Brisbane Road is a good ground for
a team in that league and with home
advantage, Orient must fancy their
chances. Forest aren't doing that bad
themselves and lie second only to
Liverpool in Division One. They have
a selection of quality players such as
England Midfield Neil Webb,
defender Stuart Pearce (also a recent
full cap for England) and ex-Orient
defender Colin Foster. Foster made
nearly 200 appearances for Orient and
is proving a great £50,000
investment. The game could provide
an upset but I feel that Forest will
manage to draw and take them back
to Nottingham to complete the job.
MUSI
by Phil Young C
The event of this week will be the
Nicaraguan Solidarity Benefit gig on
Tuesday at the Town and Country
Club, on the eve of President
Reagan's bid for more Contra aid.
Headlining are That Petrol Emotion,
a hard-hitting brilliant band for whom
the term 'Rock' is hardly adequate.
Displaying a wealth of talent and
imagination, their music covers a
wide range of tempos and is very
danceable. This, together with a
brilliant live act matching that of
almost any other, make this band in
my mind the best since The Smiths.
Supporting are Voice of the Beehive,
highly overrated in terms of content
but good for a harmless bop.
Gig Review: Purple People Eaters,
Union Bar, Sat 23rd—The Purple
People Eaters can only be described
as a musical experience not far
removed from those which they, and
their fans, advocate. Rarely has music
this penetrating been heard in 20
years. Manic, screaming vocals
combined with keyboard and guitar
sounds which just have to be termed
psychedelic. The Doors influence is
unmistakable in this non-stop
freakout, which had the room full of
moving, grooving people within
minutes. Highlight of the evening for
me was the literally brilliant rendition
of Wild Thing. Do not take the band's
warning lightly 'people entering the
gig should abandon all logical thought
processes, otherwise severe confusion
may result'. See this band at least
once if you want to experience
psychedelia in a legal fashion.
Album Review: Throwing
Muses—'The Fat Skiier'—One thing
that has to be said about this band is
that they see no reason to restrict
themselves to any particular style.
Some songs display a respectable
similarity to Siouxie and the
Banshees, others have more than a
passing resemblance to James, and
some are pure folk. True, many bands
try to show off their range of abilities,
but this band seem to be able to turn
their hand to anything and do it
perfectly, adding their own distinctive
flavour. This album contains quality
sadly missing in today's music world,
and for those prepared to think,
profoundly symbolistic lyrics, worth
a listen.
