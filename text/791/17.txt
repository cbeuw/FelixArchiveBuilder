The sports writing this week has
been of a particularly poor standard.
We will give a FELIX sweatshirt to
the writer of the most amusing, apt
and original sports report which we
publish next week.
The deadline for reports is Monday
lunchtime but we will still take
results until the Wednesday evening
before publication.
