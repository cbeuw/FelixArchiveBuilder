Another four student bedrooms will have to go following an order
from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea's Environmental
Health Officer. College administration have been served an
Overcrowding Notice on 54 Lexham Gardens, one of the College's
head tenancies. The notice follows a surprise inspection of Lexham
Gardens during the Summer vacation. Four single rooms in No 54
have been declared too small for occupation.

College's Accommodation Office are
still unsure as to whether the students
currently living in these rooms will
have to move out immediately or wait
until the end of the academic year.
Student Accommodation Officer
Anna Jones said that they knew of the
situation but had not yet been asked
to rehouse the students.
The Student Manager of 54
Lexham Gardens, Aaron Kotcheff,
described the four rooms in question
as 'miniscule'. The four students
living in the rooms are paying over
£35 a week each. 'I think that the
rooms are appalling considering what
the rent is', he told FELIX.
The loss of another four rooms
strikes another blow to College's
student accommodation following last
week's news that they will be unable
to guarantee all first year students a
year in hall in 1988. College will be
retaining only half of the flats
available in Lexham Gardens next
year. These were to have included No
54.
Other head tenancies are also under
threat. Part of the Hamlet Gardens
complex is also going because the
lease is not going to be renewed. The
landlords wish to convert the flats into
higher standard accommodation for
sale. Union President Ian Howgate
has already gone down on record as
saying that he wants to see the whole
of Hamlet disappear in favour of
better quality College-owned
accommodation.
Another residence at 8 Earls Court
Square will definately go by the end
of the year. Mr Howgate told FELIX
that the accommodation was in 'a very
poor state' and'would probably be
shut down if the Health and Safety
Officer saw it. 'It is potentially
dangerous: they've had a fire there
already', he said.
FELIX tried to contact College
Assistant Secretary Michael Arthur
but he was unavailable to comment on
the situation.
