Force over Varsovia
Imperial College—3
Varsovia—2
13-15, 9-15, 15-5, 15-9, 15-9
It is an important week for men's
volleyball at Imperial. With the UAU
finals and the EVA Student Cup only
a few weeks away, every match win
is important for morale and
confidence. This week's fixture
brought Varsovia, league leaders, to
South Kensington, albeit without their
finest spiker. Varsovia train at
(National League First Division)
Polonia, and the presence of some of
the Polonia squad was obvious on
court. Nevertheless, Imperial took an
early lead of eight points to nothing
in the first set, only to see it brushed
away by the powerful opposition. The
second set demonstrated why
Varsovia were top of the division,
SAILING
Plain Sailing
Continuing their recent run of
success, the IC sailing team
overwhelmed Cambridge last
Saturday. With good wind, for the
first time this academic year,
confidence, before racing started, was
high. (Comma fixation!?—Sp. Ed.)
The first race set the scene for the
day with IC dominating Cambridge
at the start and sailing into an
unbeatable lead during the first leg.
Aggressive tactics by Cambridge
forced a few IC errors, but the team
recovered to win 1st, 2nd and 5th (out
of six boats).
The second race followed the same
JUDO
Ippon
Last weekend saw the Crystal Palace
National Centre packed with judo
players from 38 universities, polys
and colleges for the BUSF/BSSF Judo
Championships. In the individual
events on Saturday, London took a
silver and four bronze medals, with
one player being selected for the
British National Student Squad. On
Sunday, London regained its title as
BUSF team champions (temporarily
on loan to Oxford last year!), beating
Glasgow in an extremely close fought
final. Peter Swettenham from IC was
one of the two most successful
competitors in London's five man
team, winning four out of his five
fights.
when they built a solid lead against
a weakening Imperial and rode out
easy winners. An arrogant
substitution by Varsovia at the start
of the third set, however, allowed-
Imperial to recover and start getting
their act together. With intelligent and
solid play from the likes of Neil
Bruce, and outstanding commitment
from Pavlos Protapapas, Imperial
easily took the set, and Varsovia,
back to full strength on court looked
less than happy. The final two sets
were frantic affairs, with blistering
spikes being recovered from all over
court on both sides, before the
consistent power of Walter Sextro and
Vincent Lebeault won through. All in
all, this must be said to be a match
of good first division standard, which
bodes well for the campaign ahead.
pattern as the first with IC again
winning 1st, 2nd and 5th. This proved
to be the case for the rest of the day.
In total ten races were sailed with IC
winning every one, usually 1st and
2nd.
Apostolos Leonidhopolous was
easily the best helm, winning most of
the races, no doubt helped by the
extra coaching he received over
Christmas, while consistent sailing by
Bill Chard, despite undergoing some
identity crises, ensured IC success.
Even the captain achieved a notable
victory, avoiding fellow team-mates
in the final race, and with a fair turn
of speed, finished first!
Later on Sunday, the area team
championship was won by Scotland
for the eighth time in a row—not
surprising since they can chose
players from 17 universities! South-
Eastern area was placed second, and
London third—no mean feat
considering the strange geography of
the area groupings. IC contributed
three players to London's ten-man
area team—Peter Swettenham,
Jonathan Lean and Henry Young.
This was more than any other single
London college, reflecting the fact
that IC currently has the premiere
London college judo club. Watch this
space for the resujts of the U L
intercollegiate team championships.

the pitch was holding a lot of water

New College—3
IC started the game in good form, as
if the Christmas period had not left
too much of an impression. They
dominated the game for the first
twenty mintues but then they seemed
to ease off and let New College get
back into the game.
New College scored the first goal,
which came after a corner from New
College. IC tried to play the offside
trap and failed. The ball was passed
through the IC defence which was left

Goldsmiths II—4
IC II—5
With Captain Jezz Holland making
his welcome return to the high flying
IC team, hopes were high of beating
title rivals Goldsmiths. The game
started badly for IC when Goldsmiths
scored after ten minutes. But they
were soon back in the game when
Guy Phiri grabbed the equaliser.
Goldsmiths then regained their lead
from a hotly disputed penalty. They
went 3-1 up when Chris Burton just
failed to clear off the line. IC then
started playing and pressure paid off
when Alan Glass converted IC's
second, after good work from Guy
Phiri. After the change of ends, with
IC now playing downhill, the midfield
started working well as a solid unit,
IC defence under a lot of pressure. A
goal mouth scramble led to London
Hospitals scoring a second.
Two minutes from half-time IC
equalised.
IC started the second half looking
a different team and an early goal put
IC in front. From this point on IC
dominated the game; they went on to
make the score 9-3. The goals came
from Nigel Collier with four, Simon

In the second half New College
managed to capitalise on their lead.
The ball was crossed from the left-
hand side of the pitch only for it to
come off the head of an IC defender
and fall nicely in the path of an
awaiting New College player.
IC made it 2-1 when Phil Ewart
managed to get a foot to the ball in

reach when they made it 3-1.

This extra effort was rewarded when
Pip Peel found the net with a close
range shot. With their tails up, IC
searched for a winner. This was
provided when Rakesh Muthoo,
playing one of his best games for IC,
danced through Goldsmiths defence,
and curled the ball past the advancing
keeper. IC's lead was consolidated
five minutes later when Pip Peel's 25-
yard, first time drive rocketed into the
net to give IC a 5-3 lead. IC then sat
back to play out the remaining time,
but a rare mistake allowed Goldsmiths
a fourth goal. This victory
consolidates IC 2nds top of the table
position, and promotion is now a real
possibility.
