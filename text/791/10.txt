Revi
FILM—
Orphans
(Cert 15)
There's an old, decaying house in
Newark in which two orphaned
brothers hold the world at bay, both
emotionally and physically. The
elder, Treat, goes out every day into
the civilised world to steal from
anyone he can, 'earning a living'.
Phillip, the younger brother, must
stay indoors all the time—if he
breathes in the outdoors air he'll die
from a violent allergic reaction—or so.
Treat tells him. Then, one night,;
Treat brings home a drunken business;
man, who's carrying around millions
of dollars in stocks in his briefcase.
Treat figures that they have kidnapped
the businessman, and can hold him
for ransom. He goes out the next day
to make his demands of the
businessman's friends—but when he
comes back, frustrated because none
of these 'friends' seem to care about
the businessman, Harold, hefindsthat
the man has escaped from his
bindings—and wants to employ him
and his brother.
Orphans is based on the stage play
by Lyle Kessler, who also wrote the
screenplay for the film. The film
doesn't suffer at all from being
'opened up'. The scenes of Treat
mugging and thieving and meeting
Harold all fit perfectly within the
framework of the intense action that
takes place within the house.
Treat, superbly played by Matthew
Modine (from Stanley Kubrick's Full
Metal Jacket) sees himself as charged
with his younger brother's safety. He
interprets anything that he has no
control over as a threat to that safety,
and consequently ends up cruelly
hounding Phillip about starting to read
some books. For most of the film
Treat is the tough character, and
Phillip the gentle soul. But Harold
manages to 'tame' Phillip whilst Treat
is out of the house by offering to give
the young man some 'encouragement'
by putting his arm around his
shoulders. The gentle touch of
another human being wins Phillip
over. Treat, on his return, however,
only understands force. Fortunately,
Harold understands force as much as
he understands humanity.
The mid-section of the film is about
the growing relationship between
Harold and the two boys. He becomes
father to Phillip—but still there is
something wild in Treat—'I'm not
your son!' he screams. One day Treat
comes home, wearing yet another
new suit and a ring. Pressed by
Harold, he explains that on the way
home a fat man dropped his cigarette
by his foot and then accidently trod
on his toe, thinking that he was
scuffing out his fag. Incensed, Treat
got the man in an alley and robbed
him of his ring. Harold sadly realises
that Treat is still nowhere near ready
for 'the assignment' which he wants
the young man to do.
Later on Treat comes home and
proudly tells how he made a black
man stop taking up too much room
on a bus by threatening to shoot him.
Harold tries to make Treat understand
what the consequences of such an
action would be. With Phillip as the
black man they re-enact the scene.
Treat's emotions are too strong for
him to control—he's too much a wild
animal, unused to any kind of self-
restraint. He passes out. Harold is
sad—but congratulates Treat on at
least trying.
By now we are very familiar with
the fact that Harold is a gangster, and
that all he is doing is using the house
as a safe refuge from the underworld.
But since his attempts at taming the
feral Treat have failed, he realises that
he's going to have to go on 'the
assignment' himself. Before leaving
he gives Phillip a map so that he'll
always know where he is. Phillip
ventures out into the world, free—he
suffers no kind of allergic reaction at
all.
Orphans is the best film to come
out in years; it abounds with fresh
ideas and beautiful imagery, such as
the scene where Harold opens
Phillip's bedroom window, and the
young man breathes in the night air
for the first time ever, leaning out into
the fresh pouring rain, washing away
his troubles. When Harold escapes
from his bounds, watched by Phillip,
who has been told by Treat not to
touch Harold, it seems to the young
man that Harold is using magic. One
squirm and the man's right hand is
free—another and he is up and
walking. Harold goes through the film
seeming much like a conjourer,
quietly manipulating the boys,
especially Treat. Phillip is turned
against Treat by Harold's attentions.
Treat one day brings home a giant jar
of mayonnaise, which Phillip used to
love, but Phillip's tastes have
changed—he likes what Harold likes.
The ending of the film is an
emotionally tortuous experience-
Treat and Phillip finally have to come
to terms with Harold leaving them.
Treat's layer of toughness finally is
shattered, to reveal an emotional
wreck, hiding from the world, unable
to change, unable to try and learn and
grow. Phillip is by far the stronger of
the two, and cradles his brother's
head comfortingly.
It's hard to say what makes
Orphans so gripping, why it elicits
such a strong response. It may be
because it's about connecting with
others, about finding love under the
oddest of circumstances; it manages
to evoke a yearning for something
undefinable, yet long gone—a basic
longing.
This film isn't to be missed—it's
funny, fascinating, touching and
leaves you feeling emotionally wrung
out. It opens on Friday March 11 at
the Cannon Haymarket and Cannon
Chelsea, but is well worth the wait.

China Girl
(Cert 18)
China Girl is the story of love in a
racist socity. It's more or less a
reworking of Romeo and Juliet—
Chinese girl Tyan-Hwa moves into
Chinatown in New York's East Side,
and meets Tony Monte, a kid from
Little Italy. The two districts are
separated only by Canal Street, and
Little Italy is slowly being
overwhelmed by the fast growing
Chinatown. However, the
relationship between the two areas has
been, on the whole, good. But whilst
Tyan-Hwa and Tony try to see each
other without being seen by her
vicious older brother, a violent gang
war breaks out between the youths of
the Triad and Mafia. In a display of
bloody power and retribution, the
elders of the crime syndicates put an
end to the violence.
The film is directed by Abel
Ferrara, whose previous work
includes some fairly off-beat films,
and a couple of episodes of Miami
Vice. This association with the glossy
violence of new-wave American
crime programmes has obviously had
an effect on Ferrara; he seems slightly
ill at ease with the growing
relationship between Tyan-Hwa and
Tony, which is supposed to be the
central element of the film. Instead,
he demonstrates that his true forte is
visual violence. China Girl has some
truly exciting chases in it—nothing
actually happens, but the fast images;
and pounding rock music catch you
up and carry you along until their
conclusion. Ferrara handles the
violent back street gang battles,
callous Mafia beatings and brutal
Triad executions with ease and
aplomb.
Unfortunately the film boils down
to a collection of borrowed scenes and;
ideas; the gang warfare from The
Godfather, culture clash from West
Side Story and Mixed Blood. In one
scene, the two young lovers ask how
to say T love you' in the other's
language—directly from West Side
Story. The film is also badly let down
by the two teen-pic leads; they are just
too bland to care about, and you find
yourself drawn more to the sub-plots
than to what is ostensibly the main
storyline—their love.
China Girl is a return to true neo
noir style, with some striking visuals,
such as a fleeing Chinese youth
disrupting a Mean Streets-style
religious procession and knocking
over a statue of the Virgin Mary,
which shatters, leaving the plaster
head spinning on the road surface.
The film tries to be intelligent, but the
two leading players lose out to the
excellence of the supporting cast and
to the professionalism of the violence.
James Hong is particularly good as a
peacemaking Triad leader, safe in the
knowledge that Chinatown is
engulfing the Italians. ('In five years'
time you'll have to go to Brooklyn to
get pizza'.)
With its loud rock music, vivid
dancing and teen-movie knife fights,
China Girl is the first of Ferrara's
films to rate a big UK release—it's not
as intense as some of his earlier work,
and consequently not really worth
going to see. But the next few films
from Ferrara stand a good chance of
being successful, if he's given decent
scripts and budgets.
