Academic Affairs:
the College
questionnaire and you
You may have noticed the Lecturer
Evaluation Questionnaire circulating
in departments. This article is a brief
description of the purpose of the
questionnaire together with other
items of news in Academic Affairs.
Lecturer Evaluation Questionnaire
For a long time, students have been
running their own questionnaires in
departments—but up to now, staff
need not have taken notice of them.
With the Lecturer Evaluation
Questionnaire, however, the results
in future years will be used in lecturer
appraisal. This is significant because
in the past, student representatives
have complained that lecturers
seemed to be promoted mostly on the
quality of research and not on the
quality of their teaching.
The questionnaire has been
circulating in most departments this
past week and will continue next
week. In its present form the
quesionnaire was designed by the
College's Undergraduate Studies
Committee, upon which I sit.
Lecturing is not the only form of
teaching; students are taught through
tutorials, seminars, field work and
laboratory experiments. It is hoped to
assess all of these in future years; I
should stress that only with an overall
survey of a lecturer's teaching can a
fully objective assessment be made.
For the present the Committee is
concentrating on lecturing evaluation.
Course design
It has been noted that previous student
questionnaires have questions about
course design as well as lecturing. In
designing the questions the
Committee has been careful to include
only questions about the quality of
teaching. It should be said that a badly
designed course may be more difficult
to lecture, however one of the
objectives of the questionnaire this
year is to establish a database from
which the factors affecting a lecturer's
score (e.g. a lecture at 4.30 on Friday
may not be very well received) can
be assessed. For this reason the
results won't be published but each
lecturer will be sent a copy of his/her
own results. In future years the results
will be published more widely—
exactly how this will be done hasn't
been decided yet.
Where do student reps fit in?
Your Departmental Representative is
responsible for organising the student
side of the questionnaire in your
department. He or she will have
decided with your department's staff
co-ordinator which courses/lecturers
are to be assessed and when the
filling-in of the questionnaire will take
place. My role as the Union's
Academic Affairs Officer is assuming
overall responsibility for the student
side of the questionnaire with the Dep
Reps and at the same time liaising
with the staff in the Registry (who are
processing the questionnaire) and the
members of the Undergraduate
Studies Committee involved with the
questionniare.
Elections
Papers are now up for 3 posts: 1) 2
ordinary members of the Union
Academic Affairs Committee (in the
Union Foyer). Any student can stand
for this post—you need a proposer
A letter from St Mary's
What makes St Mary's the most
popular medical school in the
country?
Last year, of a total of 8,000
applications to medical schools in the
United Kingdom, 2756 students
applied to St Mary's, that is one in
three prospective medical students
apply to St Mary's in the UK. Given
that the medical school has an intake-
of only 100 students per year (with
500 students in total) such a
proportion of the applications must
mean something.
The cynic would say that St Mary's
always looks at people who place
them 4th/5th on the UCCA form,
hence those who are looking to fill in
the lower order usefully will be pre-
disposed towards this institute. While
this may be a factor in this
phenomenon, it is in no way the
and 10 seconders. If you've not been
a member of any committee before,
don't worry. This is an excellent way
to start getting involved as no
experience is required. 2) School of
Management Department
Representative for this year (in the
common room in 53 Princes Gate).
You need a proposer and 5 seconders,
all of whom should be students of the
School. If you are interested in
standing and would like to know more
please get in touch via the IC Union
Office. Papers will also be going up
in Departments soon for next year's
Dep Reps.
Noticeboard
All notices about Academic Affairs
are posted up on the new Academic
Affairs noticeboard in the Union
Foyer. I will try and ensure that all
report, job descriptions, minutes etc.
go up—you'll be able to see exactly
what I've been up to. Details of
forthcoming meetings and other
events will also be posted up.
That just about wraps it up for
now—remember if you have any
academic problems, questions or
simply want to get involved with the
most important area of Union
business then get in touch with me via
Biochem pigeon holes or the IC
Union (x3500) or drop in for a cup
of coffee in my room—13 Beit Hall.
You'll always be welcome.

overriding cause. Life here is
different to other medical schools, as
can be seen from the handbook sent
to all prospective applicants
requesting information.
This medical school looks at the
'whole' person, offering places to
those persons who have varied
interests, with academic excellence a
major, but not the final determination.
We have a large minority of mature
students here that other medical
schools will not even consider, to
their detrement. The mature students
form a large and active part of the
school, without which we would be
all the poorer.
This variety in the intake is healthy
for the school, as it is not necessarily
the workaholic bookworm who makes
a good doctor. However much the
trend is towards producing scientific
doctors, the fact that we have to study
and pass courses in Psychology and
Sociology adds an important non-
scientific dimension.
It has been a proud claim that St
Mary's produces if not the best, then
some of the better doctors practising
in medicine today. This must be a
product of the current ethos here:
work hard, but more importantly,
play hard.
Papers are up for the following
posts:
External Affairs Officer (this year).
2 Ordinary Members of Council for next
academic year.
2 Ordinary Members of UFC for next
academic year.
Papers will remain up until 4th
February unless there are insufficient
candidates; elections will take place
at the UGM on 9th February.
