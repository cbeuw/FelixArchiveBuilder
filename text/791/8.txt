THE GREAT ESCAPE
Last summer I
amazed my family
and friends by not
only venturing out
of Europe for the
first time in
nineteen years, but
by taking a world
circuit which
included the USA,
Hong Kong,
Thailand and
China.
The ticket, which cost a mere £705
included stop-offs at New York,
Honolulu, Taipei, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Bangkok, although we
eventually reorganised our timetable
to suit our inclinations and our
pockets. My boyfriend and I
organised the whole thing with STA
and I flew out to meet him in New
York, with nothing more solid than
the ticket, the interconnecting flight
ticket between N Y and LA, and a
couple of first night accommodation
bookings.
I loved America, although it was at
the same time better and worse than
I anticipated—better because the
Americans at home (or even on
holiday at home) are so much
pleasanter than Americans on holiday
in London; worse because it was
infinitely more expensive!
However, from the hectic pace of
New York (we were there for 24
hours and walked 80 blocks), to the
surfy beaches of California and the
deserts between Las Vegas and San
Francisco, it was an incredible
experience.
We had hired a car through STA
to pick up at LA. This sort of thing
is worth taking care over—STA had
not informed us that we would be
required to pay an extra $60 insurance
on collection. In addition, the
salesmen are very strong on the 'Oh,
you don't want that one' trick. We
resisted all persuasion to pay 'a little
extra for a lot more' and were quite
satisfied with our 'bottom of the
range' Dodge!
Another thing to be wary of is that
there is no such thing as a cheap motel
in California—we spent three nights
sleeping in the car and were once
moved on by a traffic cop who
thought we were drunks but became
incredibly sympathetic when he
discovered that we were English. This
last situation was an endearing
characteristic which we met almost
everywhere (along with 'You come
from London? Wow—do you know
my Aunt, she lives in
Wimbledon/Surrey etc?).
Las Vegas is an incredible place
and also cheap if you can keep off the
betting—not difficult for me as the
minimum legal age is 21. We arrived
at 8pm and it was 101 °F (the
beginning of August). In Caesar's
Palace we met a genuine heiress and
her gigolo who invited us to stay at
her mansion in Texas. Pity we had
such a tight schedule.
Most people visit Hong Kong for
the shopping, and I must admit we did
In Hong Kong, we obtained the
visas for our next stage—China—and
a one way flight to Peking. We
planned, despite the horror exhibited
at the travel agents, to return by train
via Shanghai and Guangshou.
I would personally dissuade anyone
from visiting China the way we did.
Travel books may rave about seeing
spend several days simply walking
around its maze of identically
crowded streets.
In Hong Kong, we clocked up our
only major grumble with STA, whose
booking had never reached the hotel
for which we had a prepaid voucher.
However the Y M C A we stayed in
was excellent (and totally unlike the
European idea of a YMCA).
Like everyone, we took the peak
tram up to Victoria (?) Peak and
looked down on the city rising
breathtakingly from the green hills.
Unlike everyone, we also took a ferry
out to Lantau Island, one of the
numerous small islands surrounding
Hong Kong. The white sand beach
was beautiful and peaceful, although
I nearly got sunstroke and the local
buses were definitely driven at Hong
Kong pace.
I wouldn't recommend Aberdeen,
the floating village, to the weak
stomached. Dirty, polluted and
stinking of fish and poverty, it makes
a stark contrast to Hong Kong's
nightspots and other treats for the
western visitor. You will also be
subjected to a persistent 'Sampan
round the bay, sir?' by a horde of fat,
umbrella carrying women.
the locals at their own level, but at
the moment China seems unable to
cope with tourists in twos and threes.
If I ever return to China, which is
unlikely, I would go on a tour. From
the moment we were frogmarched
through customs, I had an uneasy
feeling about China, which four days
in Beijing did nothing to dispel.
Beijing is visually stunning—in parts.
The Great Wall is magnificent, the
relics of Imperial China are numerous
and beautiful, though in some
disrepair. Even the People's Square
and the bicycle jams are worth seeing.
However, there are many facets o f
Beijing life which do little to reflect1
credit on Chinese socialism.
The worst thing about China is the
dual currency system. Only
foreigners (and, one would suspect,:
high level politicians and generals) are
allowed to hold Foreign Exchange
Certification, while the man in the
street has Yuan. Theoretically, 11
Yuan = 1 FEC but in actual fact 1
1
FEC is approximately 3.5 Yuan
because of the privileges embodied in
FEC.
For a start, taxi drivers will only
accept FEC, and while the Beijing
taxi service has to be the worst in the
