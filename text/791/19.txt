Wrong end of
the stick
Dear Judith,
'Dear' indeed! You rotten, conniving heap of
unprintable. I hereby accuse you of setting the whole thing
up just so you could laugh at my face.
I knew it was too good to be true. Publish and be
damned.
Yours in disappointment,
Andrew Bannister.
The last ever
abortion letter
Dear Judith,
After Steven Mercer's rather excitable attack on both
myself and PATA in the Christmas edition of FELIX I
can quite understand your decision to 'put an end' to pro-
and anti-abortion letters. I do think though that I should
be given a chance to put the record straight.
Steven Mercer alleged that I had 'deliberately implied'
that he supports infanticide. For this I was related to 'the
lowest scum of the earth' and PATA attacked. I cannot
really complain about his fanatical use of language since
I was given due warning. In the past people who disagree
with him have been labelled 'bigots' and 'uninformed and
opinionated dross' (FELIX 783, 785).
What does surprise me is how Steven Mercer worked
out that I had 'deliberately implied' that he supports
infanticide. If he cares to read my letter he will see that
I was appealing to his abhorence of infanticide to get him
to address the issue of abortion on demand up to birth
(NUS policy). If I implied anything it was that, like any
decent person, he is against infanticide. The 'deliberate'
part of his accusation is even more ridiculous. I would
not accuse him of deliberately distorting my letter. Only
he knows his motives.
Yours,
Matthew Soane, PATA Chairman.
What does this
letter mean??
Dear Judith,
I am dumbfounded by certain accusations and name-
calling (''some pervert") by 'Dracula J' in the latest
Broadsheet. To suggest there is an illicit radio station
("Radio Bonk") or any kind of surveillance society
besmirches Tizard Hall's squeaky clean image! It is
obvious that 'Drac' is either writing from some second-
hand rumour or RCS has an infinite number of chimps
to churn out such rubbish ('Drac' article). Anyway, 100
metres MW is off most radios, 100 MHz is not! So get
your facts right, 'Drac'.
Yours sincerely,
A Tizard resident
