STOIC
We need you!
Student Television of Imperial
College, otherwise STOIC, is one of
the three publications of Imperial
College Union. We aim to produce
news and entertainment programmes
for the students of Imperial College.
Last year we moved from the College
Television Studio to a new studio of
our own in the Union Building.
We can offer experience in such
jobs as camera operation, vision
mixing, sound mixing, editing,
lighting, as well as actually presenting
programmes, some of which are live.
We have a portable camera and
recorder, which we use to film events
around College, such as Rag and
events involving Imperial around
London.
At the moment we are trying to
increase our membership, to improve
the standards of our programmes, and
to make them easier and more fun for
everybody concerned. STOIC is not
just something you can write on your
CV—we offer real, genuine
WEIGHTS
experience in the field of television.
So if you are at all interested in any
aspect of television, why not drop in
ito our studio? We can be found on the
top floor of the Union Building (turn
left coming out of the lift). We have
meetings at the following times:
Monday, 12.45pm
Tuesday, 12.30pm
Wednesday, 1.00pm
Firday, 12.45pm and 6.00pm
Our programme for the remainder
of the term will be as follows:
Tuesday, 12.45pm: Events
programme, covering events in and
around IC, plus film and theatre
reviews.
Thursday 1.00pm and 6.00pm:
'Newsbreak', IC's own news
programme.
Friday 7.00pm: Late night movie
programme.
STOJC does stand for Student
Television of Imeperial College—so
why not join in?
Training for beginners
There will be beginners' weight
training courses this term. The course
is split into four one-hour sessions,
spread over four weeks. Each session
will start with instruction in six-eight
basic, essential exercises consisting of
the performance of two-three sets of
each. The remaining part of the
session will be given over to the
discussion and explanation of
handouts. The first handout will deal
with training routines and the
exercises themselves, the second with
nutrition and supplementation, the
third with injury prevention and
treatment and stretching techniques
and the fourth with techniques for
increasing power for sportsmen and
the role of the mind in training
sessions.
One course has already started and
is held on Wednesday from 1pm to
2pm. A new course will start in the
sixth week of term at the same time.
A Tuesday course (1pm to 2pm) will
start in the fourth week of term.
People interested in either course
should apply to Andrew Tay (Physics
2) for the next Wednesday course and
to C Donegan (Bio Chem PG) for the
Tuesday course. Each course is
designed for four people only so early
application is essential. The cost will
be £1.50 for the whole course.
HAMSOC
We also need you!
In the past few years the Radio
Amateur Society at Imperial College
(or HAMSoc) has suffered from a
falling membership level. This is
probably due to the fact that a licence
is needed to use amateur radio
equipment, and no Radio Amateur
Examinations (which must be passed
in order to qualify for a licence) have
been held in the College for some
time.
Several people showed an interest
in obtaining a licence at the end of last
year, the candidates taking took the
exam at C & G Examination
Headquarters early last December.
However, people who wish to take the
exam from now on can do so at
College. If you have thought of
obtaining a radio amateur licence in
the past, or think you may be
interested in amateur radio, why not
come along to a Club meeting—held
on Wednesday afternoons at 1.15pm
in the 'shack' (situated on the 3rd
Floor of the Union Buiding in Beit
Quad between STOIC and Micro
Club) where you can find out what
Amateur Radio is all about. HAMSoc
will help all propsective candidates if
they wish to take the exam (it is not
too difficult, honestly!) and will also
welcome people who already hold
transmitting licences and people who
are interested in receiving (no licence
is needed to 'listen in' on the amateur
bands).
AMNESTY
Campaign for refugees and
asylum seekers
Over the next three months, the IC
Amnesty Group will be joining with
over 170 local Amnesty groups from
all over the UK to publicise the plight
of refugees and asylum seekers. They
will be organising public meetings,
lobbying their MPs and MEPs, and
raising the issue in the media and the
press.
The campaign, which began on
January 21, calls for a major review
of current Home Office practice and
for the introduction of a statutory
right of appeal for all asylum seekers
before removal from the UK.
The campaign, which is being co-
ordinated by the British Section of Al,
has the support of all the major
refugee agencies, including the British
Refugee Council, U K Immigrants
Advisory Service and the Joint
Council for the Welfare of
Immigrants. It is also part of an
international campaign which is being
carried out by A l .
Amnesty is concerned that
restrictive legislation has made it
more difficult for asylum seekers to
reach the UK, and that current Home
Office procedures appear to be
arbitary and unjust. Amnesty fears
that, since March 1987, some
refugees have been refused asylum
and sent back<o countries where they
face persecution,
The responsibility for ending
human rights violations lies with the
international community which not
only has a duty to help those fleeing
state repression, but also to work to
end the human rights abuses that have
led so many people into unwanted
exile.
For more information, please come
to our meetings: Tuesday 5.30pm,
Brown Committee Room (3rd Floor
Union Building) or contact Monique
Yeo (Maths 2).
