Drug Alert
The fact that you are reading this
indicates that drug abuse at the very
least interests you and, I would hope,
worries you. Possibly you know of
someone who has had problems with
drugs or maybe you have dabbled
yourself, or worse. Drug abuse is a
problem that is globally gaining
recognition and much is being done
to depose the drugs barons; there is
however, much to be done to help
those providing the market.
There are many levels of drug
abuse occuring in this country's
educational institutions alone and
unfortunately many 'victims' are at
present beyond hope simply because
nobody, bar their intimate associates,
knows of their 'habit'. I say beyond
hope at present because so few people
realise the enormous effect that their
concern could have in affecting a
cure. I would like to bring about the
education of these friends so that they
can help, in any way possible, a friend
in need. If anyone in this College
would like to get involved in such a
scheme please leave your name with
Kathy in the Union Office and I shall
get in touch.
I would like to stress that this offer
is open to any person whether a
student, member of staff or otherwise.
Please help—the rewards will be
worth the effort.
Thanks in anticipation, ,
Steve Mercer.
I'm beginning to get slightly
concerned about the Union's Snack
Bar and its staff. I don't doubt that
they all work very hard and under
considerable pressure but is this any
excuse for them to open and close at
anytime which suits them? I was
particularly annoyed this Monday
when I found it once again shut until
fifteen minutes after its opening time.
I was even less impressed when Ian
Howgate, our illustrious President,
jumped the queue and took the last of
the main dish. I was not a happy
person. The main dish always runs
out before I get to the serving place.
I would prefer to eat around seven
each night but there's never anything
left by then. And I never know when
the place is going to shut either. They
should officially stay on until nine in
the evening, but I've frequentiy found
it shut at eight.
I once made, what I thought was,
a polite inquiry as to when they were
planning to open. Instead of giving
me a civil answer, the insulting man
at the cash till told me to come back
later because he had no idea when
they would be serving food. Is it any
wonder that they're losing money?
On this point I'm going to have to
love you and leave you because I have
a stack of problem sheets to plough
through and a personal tutor breathing
down my neck. I'm sorry that I've
had to shorten my column this week
by I need to get my degree as well.
May I just say a quick thank you
to everybody who has written me
letters of support this week. I am so
glad that I am not alone in my
thinking.

DANCE
More dance
With a new term beginning, the
Dance Club have decided to launch
two new beginners classes so that, if
by any chance you missed us at
Freshers' Fair, it will still be possible
to learn the basic steps in Ballroom,
Latin American and Rock 'n' Roll
dancing from the very beginning.
The two new classes are Beginners
Ballroom on Monday evenings at 8pm
in the JCR and Beginners Rock 'n'
Roll on Wednesday afternoons at
2.15pm in the UDH.
Don't hesitate to come along and
join in even if your coordination is
somewhat suspect and your idea of a
good tango is a long, cool, fizzy
drink.

C&G MOTOR
More rallies
The City & Guilds College Motor
Club returned to the roads after the
Christmas break with the 'let's hope
it snows rally'. The organisers' pleas
were answered as the 100 mile route
through Oxforshire and
Buckinghamshire was liberally
smothered with snow and ice.
There was confusion at the finish
as organiser Duncan Royle calculated
the results neglecting a rule change
and declared Tim Clark/Jon Stout
winners, but after complaints the
result was revised and Paul Dent and
Paul Brooks Johnson clinched their
third consecutive win of the season.
They were going so well that on
several occasions they caught up with
the course opening M G Midget of
Simon Chamberlain. Second were
Competition Secretary Tim Clark and
Club Captain Jon Stout in an M G
Metro, who left the route on one
occasion but quickly returned by
doing a handbrake turn around the
moving 2CV of Joe Public.
The expert crew of Martin Squibbs
and Martin Doble, whose extremely
rapid pace was their downfall on the
last stage, were penalised two fails for
breaking three quarters of the target
time.
Dent and Brooks Johnson lead the
championship with sixty points from
four rounds.
Round five of the championship is
the Econorun on Sunday February 7.
