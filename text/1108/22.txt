ts object is to induce the young
to betake themselves...to the
fields and woods, the moun-
tains and shores there to examine
for themselves the rich profusion of
nature and instead of vaguely
admiring the diversified scenery of
a district, to be able to mark its
minutest features" W i l l i a m

The Natural History m u s e u m
may not be the most obvious origin
for art exhibitions. This fascinating
collection, however, proves that
the divide between art and science
can be easily bridged. Although
many of the pieces in this presen-
tation are of great scientific value,
their aesthetic qualities cannot be
overlooked. The exhibition features
over 70 works by a variety of artists
with a combination of drawings,
watercolours and prints originating
from around the globe. The muse-
u m has amassed the third largest
collection of Natural History Art
through donations, bequeathals
and purchases of collections; this
display features a fragment from
this treasury.
Artworks from the 18th and
19th century expeditions and voy-
ages are particularly well represent-
ed, but the exhibition extends to
contemporary pieces. This p r o -
vides a number of interesting c o m -
parisons and leads to an amazing
diversity of colour and style. A sin-
gle theme which links all the work
in this exhibition is attention to
detail. Some of the older specimen
drawings have been preserved
from an expedition after the true
specimens have been destroyed or
lost. The intricate brush strokes
allow the viewer to experience
almost photographic accuracy. This
has been achieved by the persis-
tence of artists such as Brian
Hargreaves w h o would spend two
days on a single butterfly study.
Arthur Harry Church has paint-
ed flower studies with a sharp
vibrance that couldn't ever be asso-
ciated with textbook pictures.
Using Chinese white paint to pro-
duce texture and form he would
painstakingly shave away at the dry
surface to realise definition; even a
white water lily on a pale sheet of
paper gains an added dimension
from this technique. At the same
time, each flower is scientifically
accurate with a precise magnifica-
tion for every piece.
In another field, the pebble
drawings of John Fullwood take on
an extra-terrestrial feel as the mys-
terious contours collide in an array
of colour.
Each painting shows an appre-
ciation and respect of the subject,
and the excitement of discovery is
transmitted through the artwork to
the viewer. Olivia Fanny Tonge
includes a c o m m e n t a r y in her
sketchbooks with descriptions of
the taste of the fruit she is drawing.
Henry Walter Bates introduced the
concept of insect mimicry after a
series of studies that are consid-
ered to be further inspiration for
Darwin's theory of natural selec-
tion.
The association of these pieces
with scientific research is continual.
A m a d e o Terzi was part of a
Malarial transmission theory test in
1900. His paintings of a horse-fly
and a mosquito are symmetrical
and precise, each hair finely bristles
out from the page with an aspect
that w o u l d seem hard to achieve
with watercolour.
S o m e of the paintings have
been enhanced over time produc-
ing stunning developments. A print
of Sydney Parkinson's original
watercolour of an Indian tulip tree
revealed heightened detail of the
vein network, a n d then Daniel
M a c K e n z i e transformed this into an
elaborate engraving on copper in a
final embellishment.
Having been brought up as a
Quaker, William Bartram avoids the
extravagance of many colours and
uses a simple scheme. However,
his eccentricity lies elsewhere, in
particular with his use of scale.
Looking at one piece, which at a
first glance appears to be towering
water plants, discloses in one tiny
corner the first ever recorded draw-
ing of a Venus flytrap.
The subjects in this exhibition,
which have inspired so many artists
in the past, ate at last given the
chance to display their full
glory...and it's free!

FRANCIS BACON: THE HUMAN BODY
Hayward Gallery, South Bank
O
ften considered the great-
est British painter of the
twentieth century, Francis
Bacon has amassed a formidable
reputation throughout his career,
coupled with international recogni-
tion somewhat amplified by the
artist's death in 1992. The current
substantial exhibition, d e v o t e d
exclusively to full-length portraits
and studies of the human figure,
therefore bears the m o m e n t o u s
responsibility and challenge of liv-
ing up to the public's tremendous
expectations - a task successfully
accomplished judging by the unan-
imous acclaim bestowed by the
reviews.
Displayed within spacious yet
neutral surroundings, the dimen-
sional appreciation enhances the
striking intensity of the canvases. A
severe self-critic, Bacon destroyed
the bulk of his early work rendering
his artistic origins and initial influ-
ences highly enigmatic. Although
the comparative evolution of his
vibrant personal style is impossible
to establish, the brutal distortion of
accentuated features remains a
consistent trait. Indeed, his innova-
tive existential approach renounces
the necessity of imagery, opting
instead for the figurative emphasis
on materials and texture. The
astonishing depth captured by his
central p o s e s marks the p r o -
n o u n c e d transition t o w a r d s a
sculptural interpretation of the
pieces, the uniform backgrounds
appearing to complete the work as
a mere afterthought. The explo-
ration of colour is geared towards
the expression of movement, either
through the sharp, passionate con-
trast between c o m p l i m e n t a r y
shades or the subtle, spectral gri-
saille tones.
Bacon represents a pioneer of
modern art; the sentiment of inde-
pendence and isolation is reflected
by the distinct alienation of the
depicted figures. Enclosed in cage-
like structures, segregated by pleat-
ed curtains and screens, trapped in
corners or even elevated on plat-
forms, the relative positions of the
model and the environment reveal
profound confinement, the charac-
teristic o p e n - m o u t h e d poses of the
haunting figures also suggesting
extreme anxiety and suffering. A
bleak fantasy, Bacon's emotionally
charged work demands profound
reflection as well as satisfying the
mysterious visual curiosity of the
observer.
