SLIPPERY TOPIC
Dear Felix,
I a m writting to c o m m e n t o n
this weeks (Feb 13th) S i m o n Baker
column, for M r Baker to complain
of someone 'clogging up Felix with
silly distortions' is one of the bla-
tant cases of the pot calling the
kettle black I've read in a long time.
Dismissing what S u z z a n e
Aigrain as a 'dubious, sweeping
statement' that 'is rubbish' is obvi-
ously the c o m m e n t s of s o m e o n e
with a strange view of reality or the
facts. If y o u agree or disagree with
the practises of the oil industry,
there can be no doubts o n the
environmental impact of oil explo-
ration. )ust look at the effects that
oil industry has had o n the environ-
ment and p e o p l e in areas of
Nigeria, C o l u m b i a and Peru or,
closer to home, last years spill off
the Pembrokeshire coast.
It may not be the role of the
supplier to suppress its sales, but
every supplier / manufacturer has a
moral and legal duty of care for the
health, safety and general wellbe-
ing of their employees, their work-
ing conditions and the local
environment that they effect
though there action or inaction.
The oil industry could, very rightly,
be accused of neglecting this duty
of care, particully in developing
countries.
While it is obvious that the only
reason that the column exsits is to
stir up controversy, it w o u l d be
nice if M r Baker o c c a s s i o n a l y
checked his facts before putting
pen to paper. Finally I must say
that the position of the S i m o n
Baker column directly opposite a
full page advert for Shell travel bur-
saries s u m s up the colleges
position quite eloquently.

The irony of the placement of the
Shell advert was not lost on me. I
had seriously considered refusing
the advert, but 1 decided the ben-
efit of what amounted to 'free
holidays' to IC students out-
weighed the desire to avoid pub-
licising this company of dubious
reputation. Ed
IT'S THE OLD
(YAWN) APATHY
DEBATE AGAIN
Dear Felix
I've been thinking lately about
that old bugbear I.C. Apathy, and
wondering how m u c h Felix is to
blame. Normally I hate the old
grannies w h o write in to points of
view moaning about h o w the news
is always bad... but after a year of
b o o k s h o p takeovers, exams in
tents, conference centre manage-
ment problems, I begin to wonder
whether w e go looking for things to
depress us. You'll have to excuse
the out of date examples - I'm in
France, and have only rare net
access so haven't got round to
reading this year's Felixes - and
w h o knows, maybe they're full of
joy. But my point, and yes, I did
have one, somewhere, is that w e
tend to walk around with our eyes
closed and our ears blocked. Yes
w e all know that I.C. produces fan-
tastic scientific research - afterall
that's supposedly while we're here
- but what else d o w e know about
our college. I'm sure that in infact
its a hive of interesting activity -
O.K. maybe the bees aren't making
a lot of noise, but they're still
buzzing. In one single issue of I.C.
reporter over the summer, I dis-
c o v e r e d that Dr David Phillips
holds the prestigious Faraday Prize
for Science Lectures, that Dr
Caroline Baillie has been awarded
millenium funding for her work in
science theatre, and then in pass-
ing I heard that the Great Hall is
one of the most coveted concert
venues in London...why aren't w e
inspired by these kind of things in
our daily college life?
Fortunately, some of us are -
and here comes the usual Dramsoc
plug - If you want to break the
mould of the stereotypical scientist
slowly wasting away from bore-
d o m , c o m e and find out about A w e
- the new ICUDS science theatre
project for 7-9 Year olds - we're
going to be creating theatre which

Felix,
Plots once pointed out that "by
not taking an interest in politics, w e
risk being ruled by our intellectual
inferiors." This is an extremely per-
tinent point of view, one which
should give people the impetus to
take an interest in the running of
the country.
Alas, this does not appear to be
the case at Imperial College.
Recent speaker events organised
by both political societies have
been exttemely poorly attended.
This term the Conservative Society
has played host to Gillian Shepherd
while the Labour Society held an
event with Tony Benn at the helm.
Regardless of what one thinks of
the politics of Benn and Shepherd,
both people have been responsible
for government at some point and
both have interesting and pertinent
c o m m e n t s to make on current
political issues. It is also important
for those w h o d o not agree with
the policies and ideas of the speak-
ers in question to attend events,
ensuring a g o o d balance is struck.

GIVE A D O G A
BONE
Dear Editor,
I would like to write in support
of the g o o d (and often thankless)
job that the A c c o m m o d a t i o n Office
provides to Imperial College stu-
dents. I was dismayed by the arti-
cle from C. Chan (6 Feb 1997) [try
1998 - Ed] which was extremely
offensive and frankly racist. What
many people may not realise is the
constant abuse that members of
the a c c o m m o d a t i o n office have to
endure during their normal working
day. This often includes direct
physical threat from some students
w h o consider it their devine right to
demand a c c o m m o d a t i o n , and that
it be of a nature fitting their specif-
ic requirements. It is therefore not
surprising that occasionally tern-
