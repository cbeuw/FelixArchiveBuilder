THE IC RADIO PAGE 20 February 1998
THE ALL NEW IC RADIO PAGE
Hello friendly Felix readers. This is
the first in a long line of funky arti-
cles about the soon t o be cult IC
Radio. 1 know that most people
either don't know that IC Radio
exists, or think it's a pile of w e t
steaming p o o . 1 a m going to make
it m y personal mission t o change
all this and convince y o u all that it
is definitely s o m e t h i n g w o r t h
checking out.
IC Radio is full of DJs with a pas-
sion for music, and w h o enjoy play-
ing the tunes that are the reason for
them being alive. It's also full of
people w h o enjoy a g o o d chuckle
and have a general love for life.
A s you've probably n o t i c e d ,
we're n o w publishing our schedule
as well as the S R N (Student Radio
Network) chart in Felix. I'll also be
bringing y o u completely u p to date
with the sessions that are being
recorded in our Northside Studio,
giving y o u a run d o w n of the bands
and on-air sessions. I'll also let y o u
know of interviews that are being
broadcast: with bands ranging from
the unsigned to t h e rich a n d
famous. A s a taster of this weeks
festivities, Steve will be interview-
ing Dave from M a c h i n e Head o n
the 'Steve M e t a l Show' o n M o n d a y
between 9 and 10pm.
We're also running a bit of a
competition to design a n e w for
the radio station that will be used
as a letterhead as well as in a total-
ly n e w range of superfly clothing
(see opposite). Get creative and
contact y o u r s truly at
j.crabb@ic.ac.uk. The prize if y o u
win is £ 5 0 of music of your choice,
as well as s o m e of the sexy n e w
gear. If that's not worth entering
for, 1 don't know what is...
So folks, keep tuned in to this
page and always remember to stay
happy. Enjoy.

although it must be clearly reproducible in black and
white. It must also portray the station as being
eclectic, professional and dynamic. Drop all entries
