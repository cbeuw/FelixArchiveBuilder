Krazy Karting Kapers You Can Run But
We came, w e saw, we conquered.
Cambridge's karting event, that is.
W e w o n , beating ail eight of
Cambridge's teams, the closest
challenger seven laps behind after
two hours' racing.
The race started badly, Phil
Mitchell being hauled in for a
penalty almost before the race had
begun. Ben Ferry took over, driving
cleanly &. bringing us back from
eighth to fourth. Next up was Niall
Darwin w h o brought us back to
second but got us another penalty
by speeding in the pit lane (Doh!)
at the end of his stint. Phil took
over again, sat out Niall's one
minute penalty then went &. m o v e d
us up into first place!
During re-fuelling &. driver
changes we traded the lead with
the best Cambridge team (No. 5).
Towards the end of the race,
Phil while leading attempted to lap
team 5 but was blocked by their
driver. This cost them a stop-go
penalty and handed us a four lap
lead. Ben had an uneventful final
stint handing over a kart with truly
c o o k e d brakes to Niall. This
caused Niall a change-of-under-
wear situation w h e n the kart
refused to stop at the hairpin, but
he survived this and went o n to
take the chequered flag, seven laps
clear.
The champagne was sprayed
by Phil over two pissed twelve year
olds that Niall was chatting up &.
poured over Ben. Donations to fix
ensuing overdrafts welcome.
Hurray! More Shooting
14 February saw the two IC " B U S A ing two novices). This is the kind of
clay pigeon shooting teams take on
the old gits from the Hollard club"
in a 50 bird shoot. The results were
as expected with the ICR&PC 'B'
team c o m i n g last and the ' A ' team
last but one (despite the H C field-
results we expect against the better
opposition at the B U S A champi-
onships on 28 February, so no dis-
appointment really.
Sports Editorial
Hullo playmates.
M e and my great assistants
have been truly overwhelmed by all
the reports of your Olympian sport-
ing achievements. W e totally dig
this so keep them coming. I must
apologise if reports appear late or if
they are edited to the point of
incomprehensibility. But y o u know,
fortunes of war and all that.
Whilst I would I w o u l d sooner
murder my grandmother than tell
you how to go about your busi-
ness, I d o ask that reports are
handed in as soon as possible and
are legible, particularly the "hilari-
ous" nicknames that y o u see fit to
give one another. Also, and this is
purely my o w n opinion, I think that
far too many clubs seem to insult
their opponents, particularly w h e n
they are victorious. Whilst in many
cases it may be appropriate, it's
not terribly sporting.
While I'm in a critical m o o d ,
I'm shocked and saddened by the
treatment of former shooting club
stalwart, Lee C l e m e n t s at the
hands of her Majesty's Customs
and Excise Department. During a
recent return from his Swiss tax-
haven, he was cruelly detained at
the airport after ridiculous claims
that he was smuggling in his body,
parts necessary for the manufac-
ture of nuclear weapons.
This was of course ridiculous.
X-rays showed that the "suspi-
cious" artefact was merely a harm-
less electric whisk. It is my sad
duty to tell y o u that the fascists
who run customs offered no apol-
ogy. Indeed they even cast ugly
aspersions as to how the whisk
came to be lodged up his rectum
in the first place. Such behaviour is
unacceptable from public servants
and I urge everyone to complain
to their M P .
Never let them take you alive.
The sports team.
P.S. For the benefit of M r Nick
Oliver, the last part of this editori-
al is not true.
You Can't Hyde
On a glorious Saturday afternoon,
over 750 runners gathered in Hyde
Park to compete in the 50th Hyde
Park Relays. At 2 o'clock the men's
race began.The women's race start-
ed 5 minutes later, with Imperial
leading the way.
The first leg went well for the
Imperial A teams, with the w o m e n
in first place, and the men in 8th.
The remaining Imperial
teams sprinkled strategi-
cally through the field.
Over the course of the fol-
lowing 4 8 minutes the
men's race hotted up and
the women's team battled
for places. The winning
w o m e n ' s team was Oxford
A, with Imperial A c o m i n g
a more than respectable
4th, and Jennie Cox run-
ning the fastest lap of the
day.
Whilst the w o m e n relaxed in the
sun, the men pushed on, with
Leeds A team storming home. They
were led home by Mick Hill, w h o
posted the fastest men's lap of the
day. Imperial A were not far behind
finishing in 8th place.
Former Olympian Peter Elliott
representing the sponsoring c o m -
pany View From, was on hand to
present the impressive array of
prizes (including the Gary Hoare
w o o d e n spoons). For the first time
in since 1968, the Sir Roderic Hill
trophy could again be presented,
albeit briefly, to the winning men's
team. This trophy awarded at the
first ever race has been recovered
from Edinburgh after a long holiday.
Presentations are notoriously
dry events, but this one was bright-
ened by the fastest foreign
men's team lead by the
perpetual student joos de
Baaker, w h o chose to
thank Dawn (event organ-
iser and Superwoman) in
his o w n special way! The
slowest w o m e n ' s team
from Maastrict University
were slightly bemused by
their w o o d e n spoon....
All that remained was
to party the night and
unfortunately not the
morning away in the Union. M u c h
beer was drunk, thrown and worn
by all (disturbing considering the
large number of supposedly highly
trained athletes). Even the stewards
agreed that it was one of the best
nights at the Union for a long time!
M a n y people have expressed their
appreciation, and at the end of the
day it was all worth it!
