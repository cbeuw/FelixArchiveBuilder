This week I thought I'd d o a
couple of cakes for all those
munchies moments. Both are
slightly out of the ordinary but
should be fairly simple a n d
their methods are nearly the
same.
Carrot Cake
«" 6 o z carrots
«• 4 o z brown sugar
®" 3 fl o z sunflower oil
4 o z wholemeal self rais-
ing flour
*• 2 eggs
*" 1 tsp ground cinnamon
:
*' 'A tsp ground nutmeg
Grate the carrots using the
spiky side of a cheese grater.
Try not to grate the ends of
your fingers as well, it hurts
lots a n d just isn't worth it.
Whisk the eggs a n d the
sugar together until all the
sugar is dissolved. Slowly drib-
ble the oil in, whisking away all
the time. The oil should be
completely incorporated s o
give it a g o o d whirl. Next a d d
the grated carrots and all their
juice a n d mix well. Finally fold
in the flour and add a pinch of
salt for g o o d luck.
Pour the mixture into your
well-greased cake tin (anything
will d o but you should e n d up
with about an inch of slurry in
the tin) a n d place in y o u pre-
heated oven (190°C, gas mark
5) for 2 0 to 25 minutes. To
check if the cake is cooked,
stick a clean knife blade into it
and bring it out slowly. If any
dough sticks to the knife the
cake isn't cooked yet. If it
c o m e s out clean, your master-
piece is ready.
Poppyseed Cake
This one has a nice crunchy
feel to it and could even get
you high if y o u eat several
tonnes of it (don't try this any-
where, kids!).
* 3 o z p o p p y s e e d
® 4 o z brown sugar
» 8 o z wholemeal self rais-
ing flour
®* 1 '/z o z milk powder
®- 1/3 pt milk
sr> 2 eggs
»" Vi tsp a l m o n d essence
*• 1 tsp ground cinnamon
Soak 2 o z of the p o p p y -
seeds in the milk for about 1
hour.
Whisk the eggs a n d sugar
together until they are creamy
and then a d d the o i l a n d
essence just as for the carrot
cake. Incorporate the milk a n d
poppyseed mix a n d then fold
in the flour.2
Pour into your cake tin,
sprinkle with the remaining
poppyseeds a n d put in the
oven (190°C, gas mark 5) for
20 to 25 minutes.
Enjoy with a d a b of cream.

Thought for the Day:
Sportsmen of the World Ignite
Yes! We won! I'm so great! The
nation is a better place!
A
s 1 write this, Butcher a n d
C a d d i c k have just run
England to victory in the
blooper-dominated a n d crushingly
tense second Test match against
the West Indies; as the distin-
guished gaffer Christopher Martin-
Jenkins reliably informs us, it is the
first time in several decades that
"us lot" have w o n a Test match in
the Carribean. In the dying seconds
of all-pervading, pure, white-hot
tension that pervaded d B s , the
cheer arising from the assembled
throng was that of sheer blood-lust,
when at any other point in the
game, the quality of the scoring
w o u l d have induced little more
than a groan. It occurred to m e ,
then a n d there, that sport in m o d -
ern times occupies a social, even
physical, niche, which may be satis-
fied by nothing else.
I wouldn't have cared to have been
M a r k Butcher half an hour ago. I
wouldn't have been very happy fill-
ing Atherton's shoes either. The
hopes of a nation rested upon
them; m e n with power to make or
break the days of tens, even hun-
dreds of thousands of fans. M y
mind, however hard I try to stop it,
flips painfully back to Gareth
Southgate's m i s s e d penalty.Few
concepts ever induce such ecstasy,
suffering, fury and relief; the male,
his natural instincts stifled by soci-
ety, has just one outlet left. This is
why w e stand in front of the big
screen, screaming obscenities, as
though it were some Druidic altar
of emotion, bringing bliss a n d dis-
appointment in equal measures, a
furiously addictive drug, intoxicat-
ing, infatuating, a n d legally injected
into our homes a n d pubs from
above, at the speed of light. All else
is forgotten; pints are d r o p p e d in a
creamy shower of ale as the ball
curls, parabolically, into the t o p
corner of the net...In fact, I strong-
ly suspect that w h e n M o s e s disap-
peared up Sinai to receive the Ten
C o m m a n d m e n t s , the divine thun-
derbolt heralded little more than
the Jerusalem United score.
Society truncates mankind's gut
feelings a n d e m o t i o n s . A s w e
become more civilised; as atroci-
ties ate systematically eradicated;
as cruelty, in all its forms, is slowly
made illegal; and in the absence of
live executions, w e have just one
outlet left; the organised war of
sport. In both participation a n d in
worship, the fetters of reality, of
work a n d daily h u m d r u m , are bro-
ken.
Why d o w e have the phrase "foot-
ball hooliganism"? W h y is soccer
linked so readily to violence? The
cliched arguments are manifold;
cowardly safety in vast numbers,
p e e r - g r o u p pressures, d r u n k e n -
ness. N o . People fight because of
unadulterated hatred; often xeno-
phobic, even racist; induced, pro-
voked a n d unreal, yes; but it exists,
and it can occasionally kill.
So the job of our poor sportsmen,
it s e e m s , is a n important task
indeed. Y o u think their wages are
extortionate? You think they have it
easy? I think not. They carry the
sanity, maybe even the safety of
millions in their m u d d y gloved
hands.
