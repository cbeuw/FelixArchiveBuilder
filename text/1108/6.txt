COLUMNS 20 February 1998
Editorial
LIGHTEN UP
Hearty congratulations are due to
the four enterprising students w h o
have managed to organise a summer
ball. This is an immense achieve-
ment, not just in the scale of the
project but more in inspiring the
right people to help y o u . 1 have seen
them at several union meetings
attempting to get backing, where
they were met no with enthusiasm,
but negativity.
The Union may aim to be o p e n
and representative, but it is far from
achieving it. Suggest serving break-
fasts in Da Vinci's, and they will tell
you that they won't be able to find
the staff. Suggest that they take c o n -
trol of the medical school's bars, and
they will tell y o u that the logistics are
too difficult. Suggest that they hold a
summer ball, and they will balk at the
possible losses. Suggest that they
put in a bid to run the new B M S
catering services... Well, don't hold
your breath.
I'm not intending to name any
names, but those w h o have the
power to get things done should
remember that they're not running
s o m e cash-tight corporation but a
student union. It's supposed to be
fun, flexible and even a little irre-
sponsible from time to time.
