THE CHARLATANS
Melting Pot * * * *
S
o, they've d e c i d e d to release
a 'best o f album. "They've
sold out to the worst c o m -
mercial trick in the book", many of
you may cry. Well, the Charlies may
also have surprised themselves,
because around the time of the
release of their third album, Up To
Our Hips, they were pretty non-
committal about anything of the
sort, nearly angry that anyone
would date mention such a thing.
Why have they done it then?
Well, it can be looked on as g o o d
and bad. Firstly, the Charlies only
truly achieved true mass recogni-
tion after the release of The
Charlatans (album number four),
and further increased their popular-
ity with the most recent one, Tellin'
Stories (number five). W i t h the
release of this greatest hits effort,
many fans w h o have only heard the
last two albums will get a taste of
the material o n the previous
albums, probably the stuff the
Charlies reckon is the best. From
the first album, which debuted at
number one, they've included the
singles (The Only One I Know, etc.
from the baggy days of indie) and
the psychedelic, Opportunity
Three, a non-album version that
spans a whole nine minutes.
Even if y o u ' r e a d i e - h a r d
Charlatans fan with all the records,
this album is still worth a listen or
three because it contains moments
of brilliance unlike any previous
work. Songs like Over Rising, one of
the EPs released between their first
and s e c o n d albums, and the
Chemical Brothers remix of Patrol
(previously a B-side) particularly
stand out.
The Charlatans are probably the
only band still around today that
e m e r g e d f t o m the M a n c h e s t e r
baggy indie scene. M o s t of their
fellow bands have long since disap-
peared, think of famous examples
such as the Stone Roses split, the
non-event of the Inspiral Carpets
demise, and the H a p p y M o n d a y s
morphosis into Black Grape, whose
future doesn't exactly look too rosy
either. Tim Burgess and co were
never considered the pioneers of
the baggy scene, and were always
rated second best to the Stone
Roses, yet they have stuck through
it all, even though they were being
written off after their seond LP.
S o m e h o w , they have managed
to develop a new sound with each
album release, and we can only
h o p e that they carry o n long
enough to bring out another 'best

Ride - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack * * * *
A
nother fantastic soundtrack
to represent a film that
probably no one will see.
However, to counteract this 1 a m
going to play a game to give a pos-
sible insight into what the film may
be like. Artists in bold, track titles
in italics...
"...The Weekend was where it
all began. Erick Sermon a n d
Redman were r a p p i n g a n d
rhyming, pushing the heat up. No-

one recognised the Symptoms of
what was about to happen.
Backstage Rufus Blaq w a s
Outta Sight trying to sort out the
Blood Money for Nas and Nature.
They had sorted out some Soldier
Funk for him and were Callin' for
the Came to be sorted. No-one
knew w h o had started 77re Came,
but it was clear that if w o r d of it
ever reached the Wu-Tang and
Onyx, w h o were at this time collab-
orating, The Worst was sure to
happen.
Rufus knew he had only one
real choice. He had to escape, and
get over to where the Eastsiders
could protect him. The Eastsiders
were lead by the Black Caesar and
his right-hand man Phife, a m e m -
ber of the infamous Tribe Called
Quest. The only thing stopping him
was his Never Say Goodbye pact
with Adrianna Evans.
Adrianna was trouble, but she
had a way of making Rufus feel
higher than ever before. She was
the ex-girlfriend of Eric Benet, and
had split with him aftet his run in
with Trina and Tamara. Eric, how-
ever, still wanted her and therefore
wanted Rufus dead..."H

Snow Patrol - Little Hide
Initially pleasingly reminiscent of M y Bloody
Valentine but they don't build on this. Thin
vocals and a lack of imagination make for a
worthless pile of p o o .
Nick Heyward - Stars In Her Eyes
This is g o o d for a whole five seconds before
descending into the type poncey pap with dull
vocals and the requisite piano. Let's just say that
this song wouldn't be out of place in an
elevator....
Ultrasound - Best Wishes
Really rather pleasant and very atmospheric with
an o d d but likeable singer. Not truely outstand-
ing but is certainly w o r t h l o o k i n g in to.
Ultrasound could well be one to watch.
James lha - Be Strong Now
Anyone expecting Smashing Pumpkins-esque
guitar work outs are going to be majorly disap-
pointed with this lifeless, light, country-type
song. It could have been written and played by
anyone and though his voice is actually fairly
g o o d I expected much better from such a tal-
ented guitarist
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Stereophonies - Local Boy In The Photograph
Really catchy quality indie-pop which will d o
well in the charts and will be played all day on
M T V I expect. Unintentionally anthemic, bouncy
stuff. Thick but light guitar with strong, distinc-
tive vocals.
Daytona - American Disco Dancer
Straight forward light, puerile, radio-friendly
indie which uses too many cliches for its o w n
g o o d . Not tetrible enough to slate with my nor-
mal glee but hardly the best thing since that 98p
burger offer.
Novocaine - Million Miles
Unsurprising and sttaight forward processed
rock with "en vogue" distorted vocals in an
acceptable attempt to be dark and menacing.
Vaguely catchy for some reason but it really isn't
very g o o d at all.
Wubble U - Petal
At last! A really crap single to review. Some
weird bloke jibbers over random crap which is a
larger cheese test than w h e n they o p e n e d the
EU cheese mountain to the public. Never before
have I heard such a pile of pants as this.
Regurgitator - / Sucked A Lot Of Cock To Get
Where I Am
The girls in my flat wanted this to be single of
the week because they could emphasise with
the title... Anyway, it is actually rather g o o d and
the B-side is even better with some incredibly
cool heavy sections. A very original sound and
style. LTI
