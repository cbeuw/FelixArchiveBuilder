Hi and w e l c o m e to another edition of the
Electric Cafe. Lots to tell y o u this week, so I'll
get straight on with it!
First up I want to plug a one-off night that 1
am doing next week at Imperial. M a n y of y o u
have said that if there was an alternative club in
the area to visit, that y o u w o u l d be there. In the
near future a few of us are thinking of putting on
some parties for students w h o are into anything
electronic. As a prelude to that the Electric Cafe
will be stepping out of the radio studio and into
Southside next Thursday 26 February. I'll be the
DJ from 7 p m until I 1 p m . The first t w o hours will
be a chill-out selection, but then I'll be upping
the tempo to play my favourite house / techno /
d'n'b / breakbeats of recent shows.
There are two reasons for this. I want to pro-
vide an alternative for people w h o are interest-
ed in different types of music. Other people are
unable to d o this through no fault of their o w n ,
but simply because they are under the pressure
of having to please the majority of people and
keep a profit c o m i n g in. Also Southside disco is
under the care of IC radio and w e want to s h o w
how it can be used. For example w e want to
make it into a chill-out area to make it a relaxed
place to drink in if y o u are already in Southside.
It seems really negative that people have been
criticising the place since it was first used as a
disco, but no one really wants to d o something
about it. It has potential and w e aim to use it. If
you're interested in or curious about under-
ground electronic music with plenty of funk, the
I'd love to see y o u there!
If y o u read the c o l u m n last week y o u will
remember that I wrote about Air Liquide from
Cologne. O n Friday night I was lucky enough to
go and see them play live at the 333 Club in O l d
Street. It seemed the whole of underground
Cologne was over for this. The flyer boasted
over 10 DJs and live acts from Liquid Sky (Air
Liquide's o w n club night in Germany). It was not
easy to tell in advance whether they would be
any g o o d . Unfortunately w e never seem to see
a lot of visiting DJs in L o n d o n , except the big
"names". So this party turned out to be a
refreshing change.
1 started off upstairs in the chill-out r o o m .
Despite being part of a commercial nightclub, it
had the appearance and feel of a r o o m in s o m e -
one's flat. The atmosphere was very relaxing
and friendly. M o s t of the Liquid Sky DJs were
camped out there all night, giving us a display of
some excellent music. From deep Detroit to
experimental Cologne; abstract breakbeats and
some light drum'n'bass, just about everything
was represented!
The ground floor of the 333 is a large bar
area. It is not the most glamourous or well-dec-
orated club in the world, but it certainly gives
the occupant the feeling of space. There was
room to breathe and it was well-ventilated. A
Cologne DJ called Strobocop was my personal
highlight in that area, playing a set that lasted
most of the night. H e p r o d u c e d an a w e s o m e
display of records and a well-thought out style
in the way he put everything together. For me it
was also a musical education, because I hadn't
heard many of the records he played. The beau-
ty of his set was that it didn't fit inside any
boundaries or fall into a category. If you wanted
to analyse him, you would be asking yourself, "Is
this house or techno or breakbeat or electro or
what?!" Strobocop really did keep the c r o w d on
his side throughout, and even got into it. You
could tell he was enjoying himself!
Air Liquide - Live and Dangerous
D o w n in the cellar w e were faced with the
prospect of a live "jam session" between Air
Liquide and the Bionaut and Frank Heiss. The
majority of the L o n d o n underground had
assembled for this. What a treat it turned out to
be for most people! O n the whole 1 thought
some parts were awesome, for example a really
dark and rhythmic techno encounter that led
straight into a salsa-fueled number. The techno
was still underneath so this was latin funk, but it
was hard, and it was fast. The c r o w d were real-
ly going crazy here. There were many other
things that had a similar effect. At certain points
I did feel a bit lost and switched off to the
music. All in all however, everyone involved put
on a fantastic show. Well done to Phuture Trax
for the organisation.
This week's Electric Cafe radio show will fea-
ture the work of Si Begg. Si Begg has recorded
his o w n inimitable style of electronic funk for a
variety of labels, under a multitude of guises.
Whether it be the quirky techno of Bigfoot
L â€¢ '
(Eukatech records), the hip-hop/breakbeat m a d -
ness of Cabbage Boy (Ninja Tune) or the crazy
freestyle funk of Buckfunk 3 0 0 0 (Language) this
a guy w h o just believes in throwing it all in and
seeing what c o m e s out. The s h o w will mostly be
concentrating on Buckfunk 3000. This week
sees the release of a new album by Si under this
p s e u d o n y m . Called First Class Ticket to Telos, it
is inspired by the episodes of Dr W h o that Si
used to watch as a kid (the Cybermen came
from a planet called Telos!).
The album is worth checking out. In my
opinion it is a reflection of Si's persona. He has
become known as a techno artist in techno cir-
cles, as a funk artist in the ranks of tech-house,
and as a hip-hop/scratch DJ in the Ninja/Mo'Wax
community. But his style is never one nor the
other. Si just does what he does and doesn't
care whether people are able to label it. In his
interview for the Electric Cafe, Si talks of his
b o r e d o m with the whole minimal techno thing,
where everything is becoming very contrived. Si
sees his mission as just recording the music he
likes, not the music that people want him to
make in order to keep a certain scene "alive".
The s h o w will also feature a half-hour mix
from Si Begg, w h o is quite comfortable on the
decks or playing out live. The playlist for this mix
reads like a who's w h o of house and techno.
What sets it apart from other mixes is the way in
which it has been designed and constructed. Si
admires current artists from the hip-hop scene,
w h o m he explains can actually create original
music from scratching records. H e cites Kid
Koala and the Invisible Scratch Pickles.
Si claims that he still has a long way to go to
reach that level, but his mix gives an indication
of his direction. Scratching and cutting and past-
ing techno? This will probably not please the
"establishment", but having spent time with Si 1
noticed a very independent streak in him. H e
certainly believes in himself, and will set m o d -
esty aside if he honestly believes that he has
created something that is g o o d .
50 listen to the Electric Cafe for some news
from the very edge of electronic music and
some views from an artist w h o is on a mission
to boldly go where no cyberfunker has been
before. 1998 will be the year of the Buckfunk.
You have been warned!
You could win a copy of the Buckfunk 3000
album (First Class Ticket to Telos) if you answer
this simple question.
51 Begg has recorded some EPs for a label
called Tresor. Can you name the country of
origin of Tresor? Is it (a) Germany, (b)
Holland, or (c) Ecuador?
Answers by email to a.sethi@ic.ac.uk or by
hand to the Felix office.
Listen to the Electric Cafe for the full inter-
view with Si Begg, his half hour freestyle mix and
a selection of his music.
Sunday / M o n d a y 22 February midnight-2am
or Tuesday 24 February 10-1 1pm.
