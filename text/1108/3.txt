Archer Aims at Mayorship
DAVID ROBERTS
Dick Raynsford MP, Minister for
London, and Lord Archer, former
cabinet minister, spoke of their
views for the future of London
government at a debate organ-
ised by Con Soc and Lab Soc on
Wednesday. Both speakers advo-
cated the p r o p o s e d m a y o r for
London, and urged those present
to vote 'Yes" to the Government's
proposals, in the referendum to be
held on 7 M a y .
Speaking first, M r Raynsford
noted L o n d o n ' s place as the
world's only major capital city not
to possess it's o w n city-wide gov-
ernment. Instead, strategic plan-
ning for the capital (transport, the
police, the environment etc) is c o n -
trolled by what he described as
"unelected, un-democratic, quan-
gos". Thus, as part of the
Government's plans for devolution
across the country, "It is necessary
to create a new type of authority...
with a directly elected, fully
accountable leader". Alongside this
presidential-style mayor, M r
Raynsford proposes an Assembly,
elected from 72 constituencies,
who would act as a check on the
M a y o r ' s actions. All this, he hopes,
will be in place in time for the first
elections to take place in 2000.
Lord Archer of Weston-Super-
M a r e admitted readily that he is
already beginning the campaign
which he hopes will make him
L o n d o n ' s first directly elected
M a y o r . Speaking of his time work-
ing on the Greater London Council,
he explained that the new authority
should be far more effective thanks
to it's streamlined a p p r o a c h .
Where the G L C was all-powerful,
employing 17800 staff, the new
Authority will have specific, strate-
gic powers and a m a x i m u m staff of
250. Thus, whilst the new mayoral
role will be extremely hard work,
"There is the potential to get a phe-
nomenal amount of work done".
Lord Archer c o m p a r e d the new role
with that of M a y o r Guiliani in N e w
York, w h o "makes mistakes, but
makes a lot of decisions and gets a
huge amount done". However, he
refused to be drawn on his policies
"I've got a lot of ideas - you'll be
blown away... but with two years to
go I'm not going to give away all
my secrets".
The most surprising aspect of
the discussion was the level of
agreement between the two speak-
ers. Both M r Raynsford and Lord
Archer highlighted transport and
the disparity in the economy across
the capital as their primary goals
for the new Authority, and Lord
Archer c o m m e n t e d that "Unless
Labour or the Tories put up extrem-
ist candidates, 1 can't see there
being many differences between
the two". This provoked sugges-
tions that the role would be more
about personality than politics, to
which he readily agreed "It needs to
be s o m e o n e w h o can use the
power, the t t e m e n d o u s voice
which being directly elected by five
million people gives y o u " .
However, he did point out that if he
failed to garner the official
Conservative candidacy, he would
not tun as an independent.
The only noticeable difference
between the two candidates came
over the form which the referen-
d u m itself s h o u l d take. M r
Raynsford has forced through just a
single question, as he believes that
"Two questions w o u l d n ' t cover
every option. The only other solu-
tion would be to have lots more
questions, to cover every possibili-
ty, but then no option would get
majority backing". Lord Archer,
however, w o u l d prefer a second
question o n tax-raising powers, "A
' N o ' w o u l d force the M a y o r to
tightly control expenditure". This,
he explained, w o u l d be important
as the Government have stated
that there will be no increase in
funding for L o n d o n .
Both candidates urged every-
one at IC to vote on 7 M a y on a
decision w h i c h will m o u l d the
shape of London government for
the next millennia.
ULU May Sell Out to Take Pharaoh'
DAVID ROBERTS
Fears for the future of the
University of London Union's
sports ground at Motspur Park
were the primary
concern when ULU
Council met this
week. Rumours have
been flying for the
past weeks, suggest-
ing that U L U were
planning to sell-off
the ground to one of
west London's major
football teams, with
Chelsea and Fulham
the prime targets.
Chelsea FC has
recently been pur-
chased by a major
property developer,
while Fulham is
owned by contraver-
sial Harrods tycoon,
M o h a m m e d A l
Fayed.
The ground, near Kingston, pro-
vides facilities for all of U L U ' s out-
door sport's teams, and includes a
recently installed artificial hockey
ground, cricket, rugby and football
pitches, tennis courts and an ath-
letics track. It is thought that it is
the presence of the artificial pitch
which has triggered off interest
Go on, Siva - you won't even have to pay the fuggin' VAT
from the millionaire owners of the
clubs.
M o n d a y ' s m e e t i n g of U L U
Council consequently m o v e d to
e n d concerns that the U n i o n
M a n a g e m e n t C o m m i t t e e , w h i c h
consists of U L U ' s officers and
senior staff, might not secure a fair
price for the ground, which has
been valued in the
region of one and a
half million pounds.
A c c o r d i n g to the
U L U Constitution,
described by U L U
President Siva
Ganeshanandan as
"written on the back
of a bit of bog roll",
U M C are allowed to
make a decision on
this key issue with-
out reference to
U L U Council.
C o n s e q u e n t l y ,
whilst a c c e p t i n g
that negotiations
should be allowed
to continue, the
Council insisted that
the final decision on
whether or not to accept any offer
should be referred back to them, as
the sovereign body of U L U .
