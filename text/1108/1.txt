IC Shall Go to the Ball
MARK BAKER
Thanks to the work of four students,
Imperial College will stage its first
ever summer ball this year. The
event, to be held in Alexandra
Palace, is open to all stu-
dents, graduates and staff of
IC and is set to rival the well-
known Oxbridge M a y balls.
Included in the evening's
entertainment will be a string
quartet reception, a three-
course meal, drinks, a head-
line band and other entertain-
ments such a casino and pos-
sibly a bouncy castle.
Transport to and from ICU
will also be included in the
ticket price.
The project is the brain-
child of four 1SE students
who, disappointed at the lack
of an established s u m m e r
event, "thought w e should
get off our arses and d o it our-
selves." They have attempted to
gain support from Imperial College,
ICU and outside companies since
last term. The turning point came
last Tuesday, when an emergency
meeting of the Union Finance
Council was called and the organis-
ers a n n o u n c e d that they had
secured £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 corporate spon-
sorship. UFC then voted unani-
mously to underwrite the event. A
Summer Ball Committee was then
set up to deal with the finances this
year. M e m b e r s were also pleased
to learn that the event may not be
subject to VAT, depending on the
funding structure.
The s p o n s o r s h i p m o n e y has
been pledged by the firm EDS and
was obtained via the 1C Alumni
Relations Office, the M a n a g i n g
Director of EDS being an IC gradu-
ate. "EDS came to college wanting
to sponsor something", revealed
Ling Li, one of the four initiators,
i B "eight proposals were given to
HHSHHI them, including minibus sponsor-
™ ship, but EDS themselves chose
the summer ball". They hope to
raise at least another £ 5 , 0 0 0
towards fixed costs and ents.
At least 500 people are need-
ed to fill the enormous West Hall
at Alexandra Palace (pictured),
but the organisers hope to see
|||§ many more. Tickets will be on
sale as soon as next week from
the Union Office priced at £45
for students. "If O x f o r d and
Cambridge can manage a ball,
why can't we?", c o m m e n t e d the
optimistic team.

Elections Liven Up at Last
NEWSTEAM
The Sabbatical elections finally got
into gear this week, with hustings
for all four positions taking place
on the three main campuses.
The South Kensington and
Charing Cross hustings saw the
eight candidates cross-ques-
tioned, to varying degrees of suc-
cess, on the major issues facing
the Union - the arrival of the first
medics at South Ken in October,
the future of the Constituent
College Unions, and dissafiliation
from the University of L o n d o n
Union. At St Mary's however, seri-
ous questioning was joined by
increasingly bizarre challenges
from those present, forcing the
candidates to humiliate themselves
in the name of vote winning.
First up were Ed Sexton and
Alok Jha, the two candidates for
Felix Editor. The primary differences
between the two concentrated on

Ed's desire for a small, high quality
newspaper, c o m p a r e d to Alok's
design for a larger, more diverse
magazine. M r Sexton responded to
this, pointing out that whilst vast
numbers of magazines are avail-
able with reviews and features,
only Felix carries IC news.
Q u e s t i o n e d on the subject of
funding, Alok felt that accepting
more advertising would allow Felix
more freedom from the Union,
and provide more money to pro-
duce a better magazine. M r
Sexton, however, suggested that
students didn't want a paper clut-
tered up with pointless ads. Both
candidates p r o m i s e d to target
multi-campus involvement, with
Ed proposing reps on each site,
whilst Alok pledging to visit both
Charing Cross and Mary's fort-
nightly.
M o v i n g on to the two candi-
dates for Deputy President (Finance
&. Services), Dave Wharton and
James Carter, U L U funding reared
its head. M r Carter pointed out that
most of their services parallel those
