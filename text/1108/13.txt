In fact, the elections

A L B U M S
LIBIDO
Killing Some Dead Time. * * * *
L
ibido: You may be familiar
with Overthrown, as it's
Libido's current single. It's a
guitar-pop rush to the veins of stu-
dent radio stations. You only have
to hear it a few times before the
jaunty rhythm and iyrics go bounc-
ing round your sonic memory cells.
If it's a quick shot of guitar p o p that
you're after, then listen to Cod's
Guest List, the lo-fi-ish Molest Me
and Blow which is probably the
best song of its type on the album.
The calm delivery of the verses
contrasts well with the explosion of
frustration that is the chorus, where
Even Johansen rasps, 'When I try
and tell y o u , you just smile at me
and say, won't y o u leave it 'til
some other day.'
However, the album's standout
track is Remarkably Abnormal.
Essentially, it is two different songs
titled as one. The first part is a
slow, dark, deep and s w a m p y affair
with a solid funeral march-type-
rhythm. The mounting paranoia is
accentuated through the 'coming
d o w n ' delivery and the chant-like
echoes of the chorus. The second
part is still, in a way, dark and
dirge-like but is musically more
hopeful, as Even is told to give up
his 'unconditional love'. It sounds
not unlike a Nine Inch Nails slow
number, really.
Killing Some Dead Time is a
great debut album that is in no way
samey. At various stages of listen-
ing, 1 was reminded of Thorn Yorke,
The Smashing Pumpkins and Blur;
there was even a hint of the Stone
Roses on the spaced-out Magic
Mushroom Night. M y o w n person-
al favourite m o m e n t w a s the
croaky and laconic delivery of the
s o m e w h a t bizarre lyrics of the
creepy Strange News but this is a
refreshing album that people are
sure to find their o w n favourite
m o m e n t s o n . O n e press report
stated that this was the only rock
band to get excited about in 1998.
There's no doubt that that could be
seen as corporate hyperbole but it
shouldn't detract from the fact that
this is a fine first album, d

PROPELLERHEADS
DecksandDrumsandRockandRoll * * * *
T
he Propellerheads have
b e c o m e big cheeses now,
and not only in the big beat
world. That m u c h y o u can tell by
the people w h o want to work with
them: Shirley Bassey, David Arnold,
Adidas... So successful was '97 for
the Props that they could even
afford to refuse permission for their
Lethal Cut track to be used in a
lucrative global ad campaign for
Coca-Cola.
In all likelihood you will have
heard their music, but do not be
mislead into thinking that the
album follows the same design as
the singles. In fact, some of the
versions included are totally differ-
ent to those previously released.
M u c h of the album is significantly
harder than the music that brought
the band their fame; something to
be expected from a band w h o
essentially make music to dance to.
However, this does mean that it is
occasionally difficult to sit and con-
centrate on the record throughout
its duration.
But the club roots also provide
the Prop's strength; they k n o w
when to hold back on the beats and
h o w to create m a x i m u m effect
when they are unleashed again. In
interviews, they have claimed that
that the album was built from the
beat up, a fact which is audible.
However, the record is also perme-
ated with funky tunes and amusing
samples. There is even (Oh Yeah?)
a bit of a rare groove influence in
there.
From the title d o w n ,
DecksandDrumsandRockandRoll is
infected with a humour that will
keep the listener entertained.
Specifically, A number of micro-
phones shows that the band d o not
put themselves above including a
bit of a joke on the album. For me
though, Velvet Pants is the out-
standing track of the record. It is
both funky and groovy with cool
vocals and an addictive bassline. In
short it is everything the Props
want to be and, at their best, are.
