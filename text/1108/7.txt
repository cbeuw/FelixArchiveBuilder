20 February 1998 COLUMNS
To quote a famous sage from the
North, there's trouble at mill.
The student unions at IC, particu-
larly but not exclusively, the C C U s
appear to be in disarray. N o w to
anyone w h o has been here for a
while, this may not c o m e as a
complete surprise. They have h a d
a poorly defined role for as long as
1 have been here, but lately they
have seemed to be b e c o m e more
irrelevant. M y esteemed colleague
H a m i s h C o m m o n m a d e s o m e
valid points about t h e m last week,
which I shall c o m e to later. Stuart
Jenkins, on the hand, d i d not. To
describe his contribution as a rant
would still imply more coherence
than was the case. H i s apparent
illiteracy, which further under-
mines his pitifully weak case, m a y
simply be due, however, to the dif-
ficulty of transcribing letters writ-
ten in crayon. O f him, 1 shall say no
more.
The problems of the C C U s are
many, but one of the more major
issues, as Hamish suggested, is
one of definition- what should they
really do? Some officers in these
organisations have considerable
disdain for ICU and feel that they
can d o it better. The newspapers
are a classic example. For count-
less years, many Broadsheet staff
have had nothing but contempt for
Felix, despite the paucity of their
own efforts. 1 assume that such an
attitude pervades the other publi-
cations, but I can only speak from
m y o w n experiences. B e y o n d
sheer bloody-mindedness, I can
see little reason for the C C U s to
lavish money o n publications of
dubious quality,
tiny circulation
and minuscule
impact; a rant
about College in
Broadsheet car-
ries as m u c h
weight as an
opera review in
Exchange a n d
M a r t . The C C U s
should c o n c e n -
trate o n academic
affairs, the o d d
bar night a n d
maintain links with the alumni
associations. Beyond that, most of
their current activities are inferior
duplications of ICU. If the C C U s
did not try to cast their net s o
widely, they would find themselves
much more effective. ICU may also
have a stronger bargaining position
with College if money were not frit-
tered away in such a manner.
Stranger things have happened.

The second problem is not
merely limited to the C C U s , but
affects all the Unions at Imperial. It
is also more serious. With the
exception of the Sabbaticals,
Union officers a n d c o m m i t t e e
members are not paid. This cre-
ates a big difficulty, highlighted by
Shin Yi Jeng's excellent letter last
week. A s the
salary bill is, in
these cases,
zero, there is n o
financial need to
keep staff to a
m i n i m u m . The
result is that all
of these organi-
sations are
bursting at the
seams with peo-
ple d o i n g jobs
^ "| that are at best
q u e s t i o n a b l e
and often, as Shin points out, high-
ly counter-productive. The pathet-
ic vacillation over which b o d y
should e n c o m p a s s his A n g l o -
German Society shows beautifully
how overloaded our Unions are
with people that have far t o o m u c h
free time, far t o o great a love of
their own voice and an obsession
with rules, regulations a n d c o m -
mittees that could teach the
European C o m m u n i t y (or
Sherfield) a thing or t w o .
The RCSU, for instance, cur-
rently has 25 officers, including
Publicity Officer (Internal) a n d
Publicity Officer (External). This
may simply be breathtaking hubris,
but serves to make it look ridicu-
lous, cliquey a n d distinctly unat-
tractive to the majority of
students. The behaviour of the
O C S a n d C S C (apologies for all
these bloody acronyms) has been
pathetic. P e o p l e forever m o a n
about student apathy, yet when
s o m e o n e decides to d o some-
thing, he finds himself messed
about by t w o groups of self-opin-
ionated pedants, d o i n g their
damnedest to scupper his plans.
O n e expects s h o d d y treatment
from s o m e elements in Sherfield,
but w h e n it c o m e s from student
organisations, it is totally outra-
geous. I w o u l d d e m a n d the resig-
nation of those concerned, but
they w o u l d only be replaced by
another tranche of bureaucratic
muppets. [Easy tiger - Ed] O u r
Sabs have done a g o o d job so far
this year. W h y not end o n a high by
clearing out the forests of dead-
w o o d in I C U ' s m i d d l e mis-
management?

Science is about wirj^eipdre* i and excitement, understanding our world, manipulating and being controlled. Science
is discovery and awe. If you're in danger of forgetting the beauty of what you do then you need to know about the new
DramSoc project Awe - Acting With Energy. Break the mould - find out about how we work with schools, industry and theatre
professionals, how you can get involved, and why a scientist is like a clown.
Starting in September we're
running a science theatre
project for 7-9 year olds â€¢ and
we'd like you to be involved.
If you'd like to know more....
