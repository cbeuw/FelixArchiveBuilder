ICUAFC VI v
St GEORGES
The Virgin M a r y arrived in style and
to her presence a sacrificed lamb
was produced. It's throat split and
its blood smeared on the emerging
players. W e were ready for battle.
W e started in wonderful style,
bombarding their goal m o u t h with
precision crosses from Asif on the
wing Atlas was about twenty mins
before the heavens parted and
d o w n came Beelzebub to lead us
to victory l - O , 2 - 0 , 3 - 0 .
Unfortunately for the opposition
their alligence was too late and the
match ended 3-1 in our favour.
M a y the devil c o m e from with-
in!!
ICUAFC VI 3 - 1 St George's
ICUWAFC v KINGS
This w a s possibly the biggest
match of the season, so everybody
was up for it (eleven players, plus
two subs - yes miracles d o hap-
pen). It was soon apparent that
this was going to be a close match
with everyone striving to get to the
ball.
90 minutes and still 0-0. Extra
time beckoned. The 2nd minute of
extra time and IC finally scored.
Scrubber beat the irritating Irish
defender and crossed it low into
the box where The G o l d e n Tamarin
was waiting to finish it off. Extra
time continued and with three
minutes to go, a freak of nature
caused the ball to be w h i p p e d into
the air by a Kings player fLthe wind
carried the ball beyond keeper
Langrish.
So to penalties. Greek Bird
was first and just lifted the ball too
high. Then Wannabe Yank blasted
the ball past the keeper after a
h u m o n g o u s r u n - u p . C a p t a i n
Hedge took the third and scored.
The Golden Tamarin took N o . 4,
but the pressure was too m u c h &.
she missed by inches.
Penalty N o . 5 was taken by
Scrubber. This w a s a nervous
moment but she placed the ball
with perfection, high in the top
corner.
In the end w e lost 4-3 on
penalties - a cruel way to leave the
cup.

ICUHC IV v UMDS
Last week, I C U H C IV played
U M D S at the Oval, Kennington.
Clearly outnumbered, we arrived
with only eight players so we
d e c i d e d to concentrate on our
defence. W e also got one player
from our opponents w h o were one
too many.
It soon became clear that we
were dominating most of the tack-
les. Unfortunately, still lacking two
players, we had to concentrate on
short passes for safety's sake, so
that most of our attacks came rel-
atively slowly and were usually
intercepted by hordes of opposing
defenders. After no more than ten
minutes, U M D S scored. For the
remainder of the match, our
defence allowed only two more
shots at our goal. O n e of them
missed, the other was deflected by
jim. In the second half, we intensi-
fied our pressure on the U M D S
goal. O u r midfield players were
supported by Nick.
W e are already looking forward
to our next match, probably next
W e d n e s d a y at our h o m e turf
against Royal Free Hospital II.

ICUWRFC v ICURFC I v
HOLLOWAY LRFC De MONTFORT
After a difficult first term during
which we despaired of ever getting
out a team we finally had our first
m a t c h of the season. O n the
morning of Sunday 8 February our
team piled onto a minibus to meet
Holloway Ladies Rugby team on
the field of play
The atmosphere was filled with
nerves and excitement, however
once we arrived we settled into the
serious task of warming-up, tap-
ing-up and smearing various body
parts with Vaseline.
O n c e the initial nerves were
over we settled into a superb
match of rugby. All that training
and practice came in useful, Heads
were kept in the scrum and some
brilliant breaks were made by the
vice-captain, Anna, playing N o . 8.
W e never lost moral what with
M o and Jo yelling on the field and
our "trainer" waving his can of John
Smith's on the side lines, w e had
to enjoy ourselves.
A m o n g our assets w a s the
excellent jumping by Kryzi (aided
by the props) ensuring that we
w o n not only our o w n throw-ins
Holloway's too. A mild lack of
aggression was soon over follow-
ing the somewhat over exuberant
slamming of Holloway's scrum-
half into the posts by M o in a failed
attempt to prevent a try being
scored.
The match ended on a high
with a marked improvement in
play for the Virgins. At the end of
the day we're all feeling pretty
proud of ourselves for getting out
a team and giving Holloway a g o o d
match roll on the next challenge!
ICUWRFC 0 - 1 1 Royal Holloway
B U S A Quarter finals. IC 1st XV
were drawn against the illiterate
De M o n t f o r t 1st XV (wankers).
H a v i n g d e c i p h e r e d their direc-
tions w e arrived firing o n all pis-
tons. Within minutes we had a
penalty a n d Chris s l o p p e d it
through th uprights. The illiterates
were rattled resulting in a yellow
c a r d i n g , but c a m e back a n d
scored but just before half time
Chris w e a v e d his magic and we
led 6 - 5 at the half.
The s e c o n d half started explo-
sively with those illiterates getting
a lucky push over try. Huge tack-
les were being m a d e by everyone,
especially Lionel and H u w . Then
D a v e - o d a z z l e d everyone with a
fantastic slight of hand and sliced
through their defence, c h i p p e d ,
collected it and scored. By n o w
the illiterates had enough and
subbed o n 6 ringers. The lads held
out but the onslaught got the bet-
ter of us and we gave away three
soft tries. Final score 38 - 11 but
all the lads played like bastards
and De M o n t f o r t are still wankers.
ICURFC I 11 - 38 De Montfort.
ICURFC II v Q M W II â€¢
W e needed to win to keep the sea-
son alive and move into the semi-
finals. The game started well and
g o o d play all round allowed us two
easy penalties which were missed!
Then Alistair Rainage opened the
scoring with a g o o d drive. Rich
Steppings s c o r e d a d r o p goal
(jammy sod!). They scored a try,
but then we proved too strong in
defence. W e scored three quick
ties in the second half through
Clincho, Jon Bound and Rich, all of
which were converted. Then we
were held out until the final whis-
tle. M a n of the match was Jon
Bound. Spoon of the match was
logic. Semi finals here we come.
