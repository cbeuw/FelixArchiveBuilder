GOLDIE.
SATURNZ RETURN. (London Records) ••••1/2
G
oldie, probably best known
by most for being Gold, is
back; one of the biggest
names in the D&B scene, founder
of the hugely successful
Metalheadz label and responsible
for some of the most cutting edge
&. influential tunes over the past 5
years or so.
Finally Saturnz Return is here, a
follow up album that has been 2
years in production, not as long as
it sounds w h e n y o u take into
account the vast amount of tour-
ing, DJ'ing, etc, Goldie's been up to
over this period. A n d after all the
hype I was unsure what to expect,
would it be watered d o w n , to try
and get mainstream coverage ?
Well, I'm glad to say I didn't find
any evidence of this, just innova-
tive, d e e p , futuristic breaks ' n '
beats.
You can ether buy this as a d o u -
ble C D , with one C D containing just
one track, which is over one hour
long, including of a 3 0 piece
orchestra, as well as loops, breaks
& vocals. Entitled Mother, Goldie
says this track is like his childhood
full of pain. Or y o u can get the
quadruple vinyl pack, which does-
n't contain this extra track.
Right, /'// Be There For You,
starts us off in a fine style, with a
journey deep into the sub-concise-
ness, full use is made of time-
stretched beats, dark atmosphere-
seems to completely change style
into a fat stepping.
Fury The Origin, sounds pretty
much like a remix of Sinister from
icals and a groaning b-line. Chico-
Death Of A Rockstar, starts with
clever use of an electric guitar, and
quickly drops into a fast break-
beat/spinback onslaught, with beats
coming in 'n' out and from speaker
to speaker, then suddenly the track
his previous album ?, with Goldie's
masterful use of s o u n d in full
effect. Demonz, is a fast paced
track, futuristic sounds, excellent
film vocal sample and clashing
metallic beats, as hard as you like.
Crystal Clear changes the style
to an up-beat roller, reminiscent of
a DJ Krust style. With a rolling jazz
lick and O K female vocal. There is
an adequate d o w n beat number
here as well, with strong vocals that
work quite well. Temper Temper
and Digital y o u should already
know about, so I won't go it them.
Finally Dragon Fly brings the ,
album to a close, with one final
change of style, a pleasant track,
with strong strings and tight drum
patterns, just underlying the diver-
sity of production techniques he
has mastered, a highly impressive
album that seems to cover all the
emotions, dark m o o d y , then lighter
relaxed flavours, deep &. soul
soothing. M o s t of the tracks having
a definite dark old skool feel, which
is probably because Goldie invent-
ed the sound in the first place.
So this album can be listened to
as a complete album and you're
taken on a pleasant, sometimes
intimidating journey through what
is known as drum &. bass. A n d for
all the Dj's out there, there are
plenty of playable singles on here
as well, ncl Jo Public
