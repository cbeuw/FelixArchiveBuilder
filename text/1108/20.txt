THE BEAUTY OF MEN
Andrew Holleran
T
he Beauty of Men is a novel
catering to a niche audience.
The central character, "Lark",
is a middle-aged homosexual, and
the book deals with his day-to-day
life and pondering. He is obsessed
with ageing and death, the two
extremes of this scale examined by
his relationship with his paralysed
mother and with the y o u n g man he
finds himself captivated with, hav-
ing met him at another focus of the
novel, the boat ramp. The boat
ramp is superficially a place the gay
community silently agree on as a
meeting place, but to the more
astute reader it will be something
more. M a n y of his friends have
died of AIDS, and AIDS hangs as a
grim spectre over m a n y of his
thoughts, as he ponders his o w n
loneliness and the emptiness of his
life.
O n occasion the courageous
portrayal of homosexuality in the
novel is brutal, and a large number
of homophobic students at IC will
find themselves unable to accept
the stark and unsubtle activities of
the h o m o s e x u a l c o m m u n i t y as
Holleran shows them. However, if
the reader can approach this with
an open mind they will find Andrew
Holleran's writing style to be
smooth and flowing; his prose is
professionally written and accord-
ingly no effort has to be put into
reading it, making the grains of wis-
d o m and c o m m e n t s on society
easier to find and understand. The
chapters are discrete sections of
his current life, and each is to a
degree a self-contained entity,
making the novel easier still to
read.
This should not be seen as a
portrayal of the gay community, as
the individuals of that group are as
diverse and varied as any other
group; the homosexuality in the
book is not the focus, but rather a
detail, of the novel's message.
A l m o s t certainly though, what
homosexuals will get out of this
novel that will differ from what het-
erosexuals will; both will find new
perspectives and views, and both
will finish having gained something.
M a n y authors shy away from these
issues, and it is refreshing to see an
author deal with the undoubtedly
angst-ridden life of such people in
our not yet accepting society.
Holleran has gained high praise
from critics for his previous works,
and this g r o u n d - b r e a k i n g novel
deserves no less praise.

Sally Beauman
Sextet is billed as a sexy thriller.
Ideal H o m e says of it, "A dark con-
coction of sexual obsession and
romantic love... Compulsive read-
ing."
However, I found the story
contrived and an attempt to entan-
gle two essentially unlinked plots
weakens an otherwise enjoyable
book. The stereotypes littered
throughout are the most striking
thing about the novel. It is a piece
of light entertainment, to be read
and disregarded. The readers w h o
subscribe to " G o o d Housekeeping"
could use it to take their minds off
the pile of ironing that must be fin-
ished before their m a n returns
home from a hard day iit the
office. A harsh stereotype maybe,
but this portrayal of w o m e n is no
worse than the ones we are pre-
sented with by Beauman herself.
The oversimplified characters
emphasise these stereotypes fur-
ther. W e see the empty shell of
w o m e n w h o are incomplete with-
out the love of a g o o d man, and
men driven by obsession. W e have
a single parent w h o s e life lacks
direction since her only son, her
reason for living, flies the nest. His
girlfriend, a y o u n g , headstrong
Oxford student w h o falls for an
older man. There is a successful
actress w h o s e producer, ex-hus-
band still has an unnatural and
inexplicable hold over her life. An
ugly, overweight Sicilian virgin of
fifty-five w h o believes her curses
and prayers will rid their lives of
the tormented joe King, a stalker.
There is even an eccentric old aris-
tocrat, a spinster of course.
The male characters are even
less developed than their female
counterparts. There are token
gays, one of w h o m is psychic, and
an English landowner w h o is still
deeply affected by the death of his
brother twenty-five years earlier.
The narrative m o v e s y o u
between different characters' per-
spectives too often to really under-
stand the persona of any one per-
son. Although an intriguing love
triangle provides a situation in
which we seek an exciting climax, I
was left unsatisfied.
This is a book to pick up after a
hard day and read to numb the
mind after excess usage. Reading
"Sextet" is a g o o d way to relax, but
not a g o o d way to broaden your
mind.

THE NOTEBOOK
Nicholas Sparks • • • •
T
he cover bills this book as a
"bittersweet and irresistibly
romantic love story", so I
was a bit sceptical at first. It is,
however, a lovely story
about N o a h C a l h o u n , a
native of North Carolina,
and Allie N e l s o n , w h o
meet one s u m m e r as
teenagers w h e n Allie's
family c o m e s to Carolina
on business. Allie's parents
disapprove of her relation-
ship with N o a h , as they
c o m e from a m o n e y e d
background where every
acquaintance must be of
equal social status, so it is
no suprise when they pre-
vent further' contact
between the couple at the
summer's end.
Even though both carry
on with their lives, neither
forgets the other, especial-
ly Noah w h o prefers to live
with his memories of Allie
rather than c o m m i t himself
to another w o m a n . They
next meet 14 years later
when Allie discovers his photo-
graph in a newspaper. Although
she is engaged to Lon, a successful
lawyer with an eye on a political
career, and it is only a few weeks
before her wedding, she feels c o m -
pelled to see N o a h and settle the
past. The resulting story is of Allies
choice of w h o to marry: Noah, a
T l i F PI f K N O M F . N A l .
1 N T E R N A l ' J O N A L B K S T S I I I I R
man w h o leads a simple life but is a
poet at heart, or Lon, a man with
considerable standing in her c o m -
munity.
While this book is not a huge
tome, the author manages to say
everything that needs to be said
without cutting the novel too short;
even though the narrative does
abruptly stop at the point
when Allie makes her choice,
the reasons for this are
explained later o n . Sparks
writes convincingly of the
young, idealistic love found
between teenagers through to
the enduring kind experienced
between a couple w h o have
been happily married for many
years. He does, however, use
a tired old cliche in his descrip-
tion of Allie - a stunningly
beautiful blonde w h o still man-
ages to be attractive as an old
w o m a n . A s for the significance
of the title, I can't tell y o u
about it without giving away
the e n d i n g . This book will
probably appeal to w o m e n
rather than men, although if a
man manages to write about
emotions, I'm sure there are
guys out there w h o w o u l d
enjoy it.
