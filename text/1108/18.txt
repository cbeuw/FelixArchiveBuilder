c a p a b l e of.
For all those to w h o m these
names mean nothing, there are two
options. The first is to hunt me
d o w n and listen to me rant on for
hours about the shop, the label, the
radio show, the club nights etc. If,
however, this prospect for some
reason sounds unappealing, I sup-
pose y o u could join the fair sized
queue on O l d Street to witness the
wicked ones in action.
I suppose it was inevitable that
I was going to love this place. With
three floors of such high quality on
offer you really could be spoilt for
choice. I o n the other hand had no
such dilemma, knowing full well
that all my needs would be catered
V
ery occasionally, I'll get a
CD sent through the post,
and w h e n 1 look at it, it
means nothing to me. Spiritual
Cleansing was like this, and I there-
fore expected little of it, only to be
blown away by the sheer array of
talent and quality of music c o m i n g
from this little known label.
This reinforces my opinion that
there is m u c h quality music out
there going unnoticed, without the
recognition that it so rightly
deserves.
Clean U p records are the label
that discovered the highly success-
ful Sneaker Pimps; Roll On, (fold
mix) is featured on this compilation
along with a collection of limited
edition vinyl releases from Clean
Up since 93'. I a m glad to say that
every single track o n here is packed
full of emotion and feeling, and all
exhibit top class production.
The best way to describe this
music is as an experimental, yet
accessible, blend of eclectic styles
incorporating h i p - h o p ' n ' d o w n
beat; the sort of styles Patrick
for d o w n in the basement.
Up in Manchester there are a
few tunes that are almost guaran-
teed to rock a crowd. A n example
of such a tune would be K R S - O N E ' s
Sound of da Police, another would
be M r Scruff's Chicken in a Box. In
my time in London I had yet to hear
this latter tune being played in any
club, but barely had I even begun
my first drink in 333 when my ears
were filled with that familiar flute
riff.
I was not convinced that every-
one in the place truly appreciated
it, but w h e n M r Scruff himself
stepped to the ones and twos I
think they got the message. A s he
effortlessly fused all that is g o o d in
Forge &. Giles Peterson champion
on Kiss 100 F M .
I could go through trying to
describe what each track sounds
like, but I won't. Let's just say that
this is probably the best selection,
both individually and as a whole, of
this type of music, that I've ever
heard. It is totally fresh; it would be
so easy for these tracks to be bor-
ing, and for each track to sound
like the one before, if not created
just right. Each track, however,
grabs your attention with its o w n
individual style and attributes; they
all have their o w n distinctive feel &
sound that differs from the rest.
They all have the same result - that
of taking your mind far away, to the
distant realms of musical experi-
ence.
For those of you w h o read my
reviews regularly, you may have
noticed that I don't particularly like
songs with my electronic music,
but here most of the tracks have a
fair sized lyrical content. I don't
mind this at all, though, because
they all work so well. There are a
vast range of vocal styles used,
with s o m e of the most beautiful
voices you're likely to hear, just
adding to the depth of the experi-
ence. Here the vocals are used as
part of the sound, rather than for
c o m m e r c i a l recognition a n d
expectancy, as so many artists do.
I can't big up this definitive col-
lection of urban street sounds
enough, so open your minds, open
your wallets and go ' n ' buy it. d e l

the world of music the time just
flew by.
To all those wanting an overall
review of the club, I'm sorry. I only
ventured onto the other floors to
get to the cloakroom, but the over-
all vibe s e e m e d pretty much spot-
on. I feel confident in wholeheart-
edly r e c o m m e n d i n g the club to
anyone w h o has a taste for beats
and basslines, or is disillusioned
with the world of attitude-filled
clubs.
N o w may I conclude by giving
out my thanks to the otganisers of
this night, for letting a sad old
Northerner forget briefly that he
was in London? FTTcl

Scott shot to fame, in the
dance scene when his last vinyl
release, It's A London Thing, a
massive club tune, blew up and
entered high in the national charts.
With so many mixed house ' n '
garage CDs out at the moment,
what make this one different, and
worth buying? Well, the mixing
s o u n d s lively, and as if s o m e
effort's gone into it, which often
isn't the case with these big name
mixed c o m p i l a t i o n s . Alos, the
selection of tunes is slightly differ-
ent to most of the albums already
released.
The first half of the C D focuses
on what I w o u l d call a more classi-
cal garage style of music, but still
full of energy and big b-lines, such
as It's A London Thing, Timmi
M a g i c ' s Get Freaky, and tunes by
Baffled &. Norris ' D a Boss'
Windross to mention a few.
The second half focuses on the
J U N G A R A G E styles that are getting
rinsed in the clubs, where jungle /
D&J3 collides head on. Some of
these collisions p r o d u c e s o m e
excellent tunes, most of which are
featured here, for the first time
showing the jungle side of garage
in full effect. Tunes such as
Katrina's jah Rasta Pari (Dubplate
style), K M A P r o d u c t i o n ' s Cape
Fear, Feel Real Good remix and
Dread Bass/ Devotion remix, high-
lighting the jungarage style.
So this is a more than adequate
collection of tracks, that should
cater for the traditional garage
clubber as well as the new breed of
old skool raver / jungle recruits.
With g o o d mixing I'm glad to say,
this will make a w e l c o m e addition
to any collection. FTTcl
Now for the competition
question, Who's the M C on

Thing, A. M C . Sharkey.
B. M C . Styles
C. M C . Sideburns.
