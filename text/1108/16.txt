MURK.
MIAMI DEER The ESSENTIAL MURK and FUNKY GREEN DOGS Mixes. (Harmless)
M
urk, hailing from M i a m i ,
are O s c a r G a e t o n a n d
Ralph Falcon. Their indi-
vidual style of melodic, deep rolling
beats c o m b i n e d w i t h r u m b l i n g
basslines and funky lyrics has been
described as 'bitter, t w i s t e d
garage'.
This a l b u m f r o m H a r m l e s s
takes a definitive look at their story
to date, combining the early mate-
rial, such as Some Lovin by Liberty
City, to present day remixes and
productions. Miami Deep is unique
in that it contains all of M u r k ' s o w n
material, including various remixes.
It is a two hour extravaganza and
comes as either a superbly packed
closed slipcase double C D , a 4-
record unmixed set, or (did I draw
the short straw?!) a double cas-
sette.
Probably the best known and
arguably the most recent tune is
the first to be aired. Funky Green
Dogs' Fired Up sets the scene for a
raw, floor-quaking house journey
which expertly combines both the
old and new.
This album is not on the same
wavelength as many house c o m p i -
lations that have emerged in recent
times. Murk's laid back, original,
funky grooves transcending
between the hardest tracks, such
as The Way from the Funky Green
Dogs, and the garage-tastic and
lyrical-loving, such as Oh Yeah by
D . O . P . , o o z e a class not often
found.
Tape 1 concentrates on the
more house orientated side of
things. After Fired Up, we have
classics such as Donna Summer's
State of Independence, along with
Keep Pushin' by Boris Dlugosch
presents B o o m ! Side B is a mix of
eight top quality tunes from Funky
Green Dogs including Liberty City's
That's What I Cot. The mix shows
how accomplished the duo are in
the remixing stakes, with a Funky
Green mix of Miracle by Olive and a
Funky Green dub of Jaydee's Plastic
Dreams.
The first hour passes quickly,
with the tape demanding to be put
on and played again. This tempta-
tion must be resisted (!) as we now
enter a period in which a blend of
Ralph's d i s c o background a n d
Oscar's hip-hop roots take control.
Tape 2 contains the Liberty City
classic, If You Really Love
Someone. This is r e m e m b e r e d
more than anything for its stunning
lyrical content. However, the style
then fades into something that can
only be described as having a very
samey feel to it.
Side B of tape 2 is a pure
garage-cum-soul event from which
I was not left begging for more.
However, it w o u l d be too easy to
be critical without considering that
all 27 tunes were either produced
or remixed by Murk; an outstanding
achievement in any producer's life-
time, let alone in only 7 years.
The compilation is labelled 'The
Essential Murk and Funky Green
Dogs Mixes'. O n this I w o u l d agree,
although at times an open mind is
essential to fully appreciate the
futuristic, haunting a n d often
refined sound of M i a m i ' s Murk.

The Prisoners Of Technology (P.O.T)
77M Boogie (Fresh Kutts) 16th Feb.
Another fresh biscuit from P.O.T and m u c h bet-
ter than their last effort. This one seems to have
more depth to it. Totally rinsing bass-line. I
don't know where they find t h e m from; they
must have a secret stash of fat bass-lines
somewhere. Strong strings, kutt up beats and
then it drops in, massive track, once again
blowing up clubs everywhere, one for the jump
up crew.
John B. Starburst / Slam Funk.
(Formation Rec) 23rd Feb.
2nd Album Sampler From Visions
The long awaited album Visions from John B
looks as though it's almost here at last, aftet
being delayed more times than a BR train.
Starburst is a fast t e m p o , dark acid b-line, sort
of number that just seems to keep on building.
Slam Funk starts off with stabs of flutes, double
bass trumpets given in a jazz style, then in it
drops, in a jump up style, beats c o m e in &. out,
squelchy b-line. Two styles from what looks
likely to be a very impressive &. diverse album.
Look out for review in c o m i n g weeks.
Courtney Pine. Trying Times remix.
(Talkin Loud) Out Now.
Peshay starts off with long tight drum pattern
that breaks down into a full on trumpet jazz solo,
always on the edge of being overpowering, the
beats come back in stronger than before and the
trumpet plays second fiddle to the rolling breaks
n' beats in a intelligent style. Roni Size gets on
the mix of Don't explain, and I was disappointed
as I expected him to do a much harder re-work-
ing, but instead goes for a laid back, even beati-
ful roller. Exquisite lyrics and voice, but it could
have been so much more than just a nice tune.
Sadie Glutz. Strong Language EP.
(Silver Planet) Out Soon.
2 0 0 0 A D ' s club mix is a hard 'n' fast house
track, driven by bass drums, strong keys and
a hypnotic array of atmosphericals. Sadie's
mix is a more trancy affair.
A excellent deep break-beat mix of Crazy
Sadie c o m e s from Starecase, that builds nice-
ly to end in a more standard house style. O n e
for the DJ w h o likes to put some variation in
their sets.
Gearwhore. The Passion EP.
(Astralworks) Mid March.
Gearwhore c o m e straight out of Chicago, the
home of house, and this latest release is in a
deep house/techno style. Gearwhore is a truly
diverse producer and a master of all genres of
electronic music. This shines through in this
latest offering, with D&J5 break-beats creeping
in here ' n ' there and strong acid tendencies.
All this is kept at a steady pace with a hard
edge to it. Dare I call this intelligent house
music?
Madley. Marakesh.
(Bosca Beats) 2nd March.
This one starts off with bass-drum & bongo
setting the pace, fast 'n' furious. Tight percus-
sion and a banging bassline soon join in to
create a full on no messing banging house
track. Flip-side is more minimal again banging
bass-drum, bouncy b-line and wiggerly acid
sounds, reminiscent of Jon The Dentist style.
Flex kru. Watch the Flex
(phuture trax) Mid March.
This one's been working it in the clubs, to great
success, for a while now and is being released
with 3 very impressive and different mixes. At
a push I'd have to say 1 favour Andy mowats
mix, which totally dispenses with the ragga
lyrics and loops Suzie Q ' s exquisite vocal "Anit
got the love" to great effect with funky step-
ping beats and bouncy sub-bass. This tune just
grows and grows on ya. Other mixes take it in
different directions; one in a raggarge style and
the other in a more deep dubby variation.
Piece by Piece. Nobody's Business.
Dreem Teem Mixes. Early March
You get two mixes to choose from; one more
vocal, the other less vocal, more club orientat-
ed with tuffer beats and fatter b-line.This is
another quality Dreem Teem track (remix),
using a broken beat (2 step) sort of style.
Excellent use of Piece by Piece vocal talents,
stabs of this &. that and a h u m m i n g bass-line,
another guaranteed floor filler.
Underground Solutions Feat. Colour Girl.
Tears (4 Liberty) Early March.
The debut release for Colour Girl on 4 Liberty
records and is tipped by many for great things.
I'm beginning to see why, as she has a distinc-
tive voice and writes her o w n lyrics! Dreem
Teem get on the mix here, and give it that two
step treatment, and d e e p sub-bass. However, I
prefer Underground Solutions' dub mix. With
stabs of the vocal keyboards working togeth-
er and excellent c h o p p e d up beats and a dubby
bassiine you can't go wrong.
