pers become a little frayed. I d o not
know the circumstances of the dis-
pute between C. Chan and the said
Accommodation Officer, however,
such disputes are rarely one-sided.
Although I can understand that the
student was clearly very upset I a m
dissapointed that t h e Editor
allowed publication o f this c o m -
plaint given that it w a s o f such a
personal nature.
Surely the student w o u l d have
been far better advised t o seek help
from a tutor o r their
A c c o m m o d a t i o n U n i o n R e p i n
order to resolve this matter. Public
slanging only perpetuates hurt and
resentment and rarely resolves any-
thing.

AND FOR THE
LAST TIME: OIL.
Dear Felix,
O n c e again I find myself read-
ing Simon Baker's c o l u m n (issue
1107) a n d realising h o w i l l -
informed he is about the oil indus-
try. To suggest that the oil industry
in general is not responsible for
environmental damage a n d denial
of global warming is foolish. O n e
only has t o read Roger Geffen's arti-
cle in Felix (issue 1 1 0 1 , 5 t h o f
December, still available o n the
Felix w e b pages) to learn of the
attempts and success of the Global
Climate Coalition (GCC) to scupper
the Kyoto Climate Change
Conference held in December o f
last year.
The G C C is a n organisation
dedicated to discrediting climate
change by funding the minority of
scientists in the field of climate
change w h o are skeptical of climate
change a n d publicising their find-
ings in a way that will make people
believe it is the opinion of t h e
whole scientific community. The
G C C funded a huge advertising
campaign o n American television
during the run u p to the Kyoto
Conference to create a fear of a
possible fall in living standards d u e
to curtailment of the use of oil. I
would consider moving away from
oil a n d towards renewable energy
sources would raise living stan-
dards. W h e n 1 c o m e o u t of
Gloucester Road tube station every
morning o n m y way into college I
have to put up with the foul stench
of exhaust fumes. Is this really
good for us, is this price worth pay-
ing for the freedom to drive, or
would w e be better off if there was
no traffic, belching noxious fumes
into t h e s a m e air w e have t o
breathe? Surely a life without oil
would be a better one.
So w h o are the members of
the G C C ? Shell, Exxon (known as
Esso in Europe), M o b i l , Texaco and
Chevron t o name a few, but also
those reliant o n o i l like Ford,
General M o t o r s (known as Vauxhall
in Britain) a n d t h e A m e r i c a n
A u t o m o b i l e Manufacturers
Association. The likes of B P a n d
Shell U K m a y admit t o a link
between the burning of fossil fuels
and global w a r m i n g but t h e
American companies are still firmly
in denial. A s for the issue of envi-
ronmental destruction, at every
stage of oil use from exploration,
extraction, transportation, refining
and consumption there is pollution
all the way. A s for BP trying t o look
'green' with its solar division, a little
further reading reveals that B P
actually spend more money publi-
cising their research facilities for
renewable energy than they spend
on the research itself. This leads
me t o believe that BP solar is little
more than a PR stunt. But don't just
take m y w o r d for it, have a read:

IN DEFENCE OF
THE UNIONS
Dear Jeremy,
Whilst I a m grateful for your
drawing attention to the great need
for better student academic repre-
sentation ("Time to abolish CCUs",
editorial, Felix issue 1 106), 1 think
that you are wrong to call for C C U s
to be got rid of.
The C C U s help t o provide an
immediate sense of identity a n d
promote a feeling of belonging.
They are more able to d o this than
ICU because they are so much
smaller a n d because, due to the
layout of the college, o n e is far
more likely to meet u p with stu-
dents from the same C C U than
from others in the course of a nor-
mal college day. The bar nights
organised by the C C U s are also
more intimate a n d conducive t o
making new friends than the events
organised by ICU Ents (conducive
to pulling someone you've never
met before rather than someone
you've been after for a while).
In academic and welfare issues,
there are likely to be significant
similarities between the problems
which students from a particular
C C U face. There are, of course, dif-
ficulties w e all have such as acco-
modation: these are a job for ICU.
ICU provides valuable facilities,
which allow us to meet u p with
other students from all areas of the
college. This integration is obvious-
ly desirable, but so is the develop-
ing of contacts within subject areas
similar to our o w n .
1 agree that some aspects of
the C C U s are currently archaic (e.g.
mascotry) but, as I have just
explained, there are also some very
important functions, which they
perform. W e should modernise and
improve u p o n t h e g o o d work,
which many C C U s d o , rather than
reject them because they're not yet
as g o o d as they could be. A s to
your specific example - a student
has problems with a lecturer; what
can he or she do? Your suggestion
is, "At present, not much." I would
instead give the answer- speak to
your year reps/ dep rep/ academic
affairs officer. They should be able
to address the problem at the next
staff/student committee meeting at
the very latest. (External assessors
evaluating a department often ask
to have a look at the minutes from
these meetings to check
that problems are being dealt with-
this should encourage the depart-
ment to act.) If y o u receive no help
from any of these people, tell your
senior tutor and/ or your C C U or
ICU that the representatives aren't
doing their jobs properly. You could
try talking t o the lecturer involved-
s o m e of them d o pay heed to the
people they are being employed to
teach!
Yours sincerely,
Debbie M i d d l e t o n .
(joint R S M U academic affairs
officer)
P.S. A reminder t o all stu-
dents... the time for election of
new C C U officers is upon us. If
there's anything you think they can
d o better, share your ideas and get
involved.
