THE BOXER
Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emily Watson, Brian Cox
Director: lim Sheridan -k-k-kV2
D
anny (Day-Lewis) doesn't
say m u c h , but then he has
just spent fourteen years
behind bars, mainly because he
wouldn't grass-up his former IRA
colleagues. N o w he w a n t s his
actions to do the talking by setting
up a non-sectarian boxing-gym in
Belfast. H e also wants to resume
his relationship with his teenage
love (Watson), w h o is however
officially a " W i f e " (of an IRA
prisoner). Set against the back-
ground of a recently agreed IRA
ceasefire, Danny finds stern
opposition to his intentions.
Boxing is perhaps the most
violent and primitive of sports and
seems an o d d choice for a m a n
who wants the slaughter of inno-
cents to stop. There is though no
room to hide in a ring and his true
VIDEOS TO BUY
spirit is revealed for all to see.
The movie draws on the angst,
politics and the violence of The
Troubles; but the complexity of
issues which cannot be adequately
covered in a two hour film mean
some of the characters are neces-
sarily stereotypes. Nonetheless,
the story still retains a genuine feel
and no special effects are required
to maintain the viewer's attention
and involvement.
joe Hamill, an IRA leader
played admirably by Brian Cox,
sums-up the conflicting emotions
associated with trying to forge
ahead and at least forgive if not
forget. D a y - L e w i s (coached by
Barry M c G u i g a n for the boxing
scenes) also gives a brilliantly
intense performance. The Boxer,
billed as a love story, is a stylish
and worthwhile offering. Q

MICROCOSMOS
Starring: Dung Beetles, Ladybirds, Caterpillars
D i r e c t o n C l a u d e Nuridsany, M a r i e Perennou
Not a video for arachnophobics this one. Close-
ups of spiders waiting in ambush in their webs
appear time and again as we observe the
intricate workings of nature from an unique
vantage point.
It took biologists t w o years to design
equipment powerful enough to enter this micro-
scopic world but the wait was well worth it.
Caterpillars appear to be the size of trains and
even butterflies resemble a monstrous alien
when viewed up close and personal. Matching
the beautiful filming is awesome sound which
catches the thunderous pecking of birds and the
buzzing of insects' wings. Kristin Scott-Thomas
narrates this unmissable treat for wildlife
enthusiasts. D Chris
