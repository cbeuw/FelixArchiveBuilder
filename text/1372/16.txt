Dench cranks up the freak factor
Is the film adaptation of Zoë Heller’s 2003 novel really worthy of the Oscar nominations it has received?
Three years ago, UK movie produc-
tion was thrown into chaos by tax
reforms that threatened to kill the
industry in this country. Stalwarts
like the Bond franchise were go-
ing to decamp to Eastern Europe
to save money, and the Harry Pot-
ter films had an uncertain future. A
sad time indeed for the country that
raised Hitchcock, amongst other
greats.
But then something changed,
and as 2006 passed and 2007 set in,
it seems that we might be back on
track. The Queen is at the forefront,
leading her people towards Oscar
victory, but this was never going to
be a one woman assault. Along with
Kate Winslet, there is a third, and
there’s plenty fight left in good ol’
Dame Judi Dench yet, as Notes on
a Scandal proves.
For those of you who haven’t seen
the preposterously thorough trail-
er, the premise is an intriguing one.
Dench plays a battle-axe teacher,
narrating through her diary the
story of her developing friendship
with new staff room addition, Cate
Blanchett, and, as it turns out, Judi
might be in it for more than the odd
pint down the local, *nudge wink*.
Temptation of a different persua-
sion entirely takes Blanchett how-
ever, in the form of one of her new
pupils, despite her husband, Bill
Nighy, waiting at home. If the scan-
dal of the title has not yet grabbed
you, rest assured that Patrick Mar-
ber’s script in the hands of such ca-
pable actors definitely will.
This is a film based on youthful
Alex Casey traits that the characters just can’t
leave in the classroom: infatuation,
desire, dissatisfaction with life and
revenge. Blanchett longs to define
herself outside her family while
Dench longs to find someone. In-
nocent enough it seems, but some
children just can’t deal with not get-
ting their own way. And therein lies
the game…
Dench is one of the greats, with
an ability to lift characters that
seem one-dimensional to an un-
precedented level. Without her, Mrs
Henderson Presents would surely
never have been made, never mind
seen. Her character in Notes is not
an easily likeable one, scheming to
the end and relishing in malevo-
lence, yet Dench lets us understand
her desperation and so elicits the
slight sympathy that would have
escaped a lesser actress.
Blanchett also surpasses her
rôle in Babel, as a conflicted teach-
er born into a middle-class family
during the age of teenage rebellion
and now trapped in the monotony
of a family life that she struggles
to identify with. Her foolishness is
not as easily accepted by the audi-
ence as the loneliness of Dench’s
character, but once caught up in
everything, she holds her own. Bill
Nighy plays Blanchett’s cuckold in
the final piece of the acting show-
cased here, capturing my attention
in a way I hadn’t expected between
the two fearsome female leads.
The real star here is Patrick Mar-
ber’s screenplay though, adapted
from Zoe Heller’s novel, as it com-
pletely envelops you. This is elo-
quence that eludes Hollywood and
strikes a blow for the Brits in film-
making.Itisbyturnscomical,bitchy
and sinister, especially Dench’s
narration, which leads to the most
stellar moments. The schoolyard
analogy propels the story forward
as basic adolescent emotions usurp
reason throughout life, and its col-
lection of fantastic one-liners mean
my money lies here for the Best
Adapted Screenplay Oscar.
The film isn’t perfect, I grant you.
It seems to cut itself short at the
end and for only 90 minutes run-
ning time this seems a shame. Also,
if you’ve seen the trailer, I don’t
know how much is going to surprise
you plot-wise. The treat here is not
simply the story, nor Dame Judi’s
bath scene, but the words that tell
the story.
This is expression as only the
Brits can do – Hollywood hasn’t
won yet.
Blanchett could swear she felt someone looking at her
