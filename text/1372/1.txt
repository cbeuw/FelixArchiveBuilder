First censure motion for more than twenty years passes against the Deputy President (Graduate Students)
A motion of censure was passed
at Council on Monday against the
Deputy President (Graduate Stu-
dents), Shama Rahman.
Ms Rahman had initially faced a
no confidence motion, but Council
voted 17-10 to amend the proceed-
ings to a censure vote. The censure
itself passed almost unanimously,
with only two of the twenty-seven
Council members present voting
against it. Since then, Felix has
learned that one, if not both of the
Andy Sykes
Editor-in-chief
votes cast against the censure mo-
tion were from Council members
who were dissatisfied with the
move to censure, preferring instead
a motion of no confidence.
The proceedings opened with a
lengthy speech by Ms Rahman in
her defence, which Jon Matthews
(Deputy President, Finance & Serv-
ices), the paper’s author, responded
to before the debate was opened up
to the floor, and an arranged list of
speakers.
Council members were given a
full rebuttal to Mr Matthews’ paper,
which ran to sixty pages, bringing
the total length of documents each
member was expected to read to
more than one hundred pages.
Ms Rahman brought a number of
GSA Executive members to speak
for her; however, most Council
members seemed dissatisfied with
their defence of Shama, which fo-
cussed on her GSA Chair role and
very little on her Deputy President
role (which requires her to work
the same hours as the other sabbs,
among other things). They praised
her approachable and friendly
manner, and the events that she
had organised.
They raised the point about a
postgraduate representative’s fate
being voted on by a mostly under-
graduate body, even though Ms
Rahman is a Deputy President,
elected by the entire student body.
Most of the Council rejected this
defence, and the repetition of this
point only served to frustrate some
of those present.
Surprisingly, the controversial
evidence that made it into the final
paper (namely, the monitoring of
Ms Rahman’s arrival times, and the
email evidence of an alleged pre-
meditated ‘sickie’ as rerpoted pre-
viously) was barely touched upon.
Most of the early discussion cen-
tred around Ms Rahman’s poor
timekeeping as described in the pa-
per. Notably, these were failures to
attend important College meetings,
the absence from Management
& Planning Group (a confidential
staff/sabb briefing), and her run-
ning of the GSA stall at Freshers’
Fair. Ms Rahman offered a number
of excuses for these, and accept
that her timekeeping was poor.

This is the first censure
against a sabbatical since
1981, when Danny McCabe (a
former Deputy President) was
censured by Council.
A censure motion is, as one
officer put it, “an official slap
on the wrist”. It means that
Council has accepted poor
conduct on the part of the of-
ficer who is censured.
It carries no immediate effect,
unlike a no confidence motion,
which would have resulted in
Ms Rahman’s removal from
the DPGS position.
The no confidence motion
was written by Jon Matthews
(Deputy President, Finance &
Services), and has been held
up in Union Court while vari-
ous legalities were discussed.
The censure motion also
requires that any new paper
brought to Council about Ms
Rahman’s performance to be
a no confidence motion. The
new motion cannot be ‘down-
graded’ to a censure.
What is censure?
Defending: Shama Rahman, Deputy President (Graduate Students) Prosecuting: Jon Matthews, Deputy President (Finance & Services)
