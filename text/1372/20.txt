N
ogdush know what you
thinking. You thinking,
“I look no hott like
Nogdush, how I get
nighty-fun-times like
Nogdush do many moontimes?”
Well, it like Papa Vregdush always
say, “Vrasubatburuk ug butharu-
batgruiuk.” Papa Vregdush quite
the joker.
But serious now, meatsacks. If
you want baby-making and you no
gots club to get lover with, then
there only one way to get in the
lovesheets – treat a lady nicetimes.
Go to these place and do right
thing, and lady will like you. Take
Nodgush word.
First Nogdush take you to Out-
land. Outland not the nice place you
could go, but at least it not all clean
like those stone meatsack castles.
Outland sandy, with rocks, like
Mama Vregdush make her soup.
Nogdush not sure why planet
floats in bits like that, or why peo-
ple still like go there, but one thing
Nogdush does sure of is what
makes the ladies love Nogdush, and
Outland skies are full of pretty stars
and big planets that make Nogdush
feel sick.
Maybe ladies like feel sick?
Nogdush not know, it not matter,
just take lady on nice walk under
stars and then leave sandy place
for better world with more eatable
things.
Wetlands might seem like smelly
swamp place full of mud and bugs,
and that because it is smelly swamp
Gal, you’re my world (of Warcraft)
Everyone’s favourite green casanova Nogdush Vregdush provides tips to get the orc of your dreams
She look lonely, lost in wilderness, needing love-love, eh? That mean it problably okay to club her now
place. But Nogdush know that many
lady like nature, and elfing not only
people that know what a flower is.
Nogdush eat many flowers, and like
them too. Some lady like looking at
flower and tree, though, so try not
to eat them all – Nogdush made
that mistake already! Eating man-
grove tree not same as night at res-
taurant for first date.
Apparently.
Anyway, wetland good in evening,
with moony-moon out and no-one
around to see Nogdush show his
axe. Next place please.
Darnassus. Hmm. Nogdush not
really like the pointy-eared, tree-
shooting catfacts, but he guess
Night Elves doing something right
because everygirl says Darnassus
is pretty place. Nogdush not like
it. Too much water. And where are
spikes and red dust? Nogdush like
spikes. It remind him of home, and
childhood.
Darnassus okay for loving place. It
a bit like shopping centre – strange
plants and silly water features, but
good place to pick up chicks if you
not like Nogdush and not have Or-
cish charm. It hard to get to, but
no-one ever there and that mean
plenty of places to sit and spit at
fireflies.
No-one really like elfing. Darnas-
sus just tourist place. Better place
to go is Deeprun Tram. Okay, lots of
meatsack get in the way of orc-love.
But train ride is fun, and you catch
rats for special lady! Everyone love
special rats. Nogdush called Love
Rat all the time.
Deeprun sometimes make
Nogdush sweaty, so Nogdush nor-
mally go out to forest for meaty
food and air. One time Nogdush
came to Mulgore. Mulgore okay but
too much blue sky. But this time
Nogdush see many tiny people with
banners! Darkmoon Faire came,
and Nogdush went for much free
drink.
Nogdush also see many ladies
here. Ladies come for prizes and
buying things that kill, but also
some like Nogdush, so he take
them around the Faire and show
them good time.
Everyone love the Faire. Nogdush
got fortune read and got told about
eating beef. Nogdush never forget.
Nogdush not like sand at beach.
Red sand okay. Sand and water get
in nasty places not made for sand.
Some meatsacks like Steamwhee-
dle Port, Nogdush think, because of
water and sand. Maybe ladies like
also? Nogdush never go there. But
Nogdush guess it might look nice if
you had less hair than Nogdush.
Nogdush prefer hair. Nogdush
prefer snow, too, so Nogdush nev-
er go to Steamwheedle – he go to
Alterac instead. Not nice people
up there – tiny crazy, with lots of
talking about shadows and slaves.
Nogdush not really notice, as he too
busy building snow-orcs, and mak-
ing ladies laugh at his sexy jokes.
Some people up there not so nice,
but Nogdush usually throw them
off mountain or at rock. Ladies not
like that so much, but he know that
there is the right orc out there for
him who understand him better.
Nogdush just want peace, quiet and
things to axe.
Nogdush do his best to teach you
love in Azeroth, but practice make
perfect. Always remember how
Nogdush works, and never forget
famous line, “Amal shufar, at rrug”.
It very beautiful, but not work on
most lady.
Nogdush off to get ready for date
with himself now. It lonely being
beautiful.
