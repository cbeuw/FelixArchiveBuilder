Beta Focus – Test Drive Unlimited
Adam Omar takes Atari’s latest racing effort out for a spin on the information superhighway
W
elcome fellow
PC Gamers, to
the finest driv-
ing game ever.
Notice I said the
“finest driving game”, and not the
“finest racing game”. This is a key
point, since the foremost goal of
Test Drive Unlimited is amassing
vast amounts of wealth and buying
lots of seizure-inducingly expensive
cars. Why am I reviewing the beta
version, some of you might ask?
Well the game was released for the
Xbox 360 last year and (thankfully)
Atari have allowed six months of
fine tuning for the PC version. It’s
as good as done with only very mi-
nor bugs to wrinkle out.
TDU was a revolutionary game
first released for the Xbox 360 at the
end of last year, and is revolution-
ary in that it is a driving MMO. You
have the option of playing through
the game using a single player or a
multiplayer profile, the main differ-
ence being that in online mode, the
island’s random NPC racers are re-
placed by human players.
Anisland?TDUtakesplaceonthe
island of Oahu, Hawaii. The entire
island and its roads have been me-
ticulously recreated in game, and
scaled so that 1km of in game road
will take you 1 minute to traverse
if you’re going at 60km/h (i.e. it will
take you the same amount of time
to drive round it in game as you
would in real life, assuming you
have a 600bhp car in real life).
Graphically, it’s a lush paradise,
with softly swaying trees and wavy
grass and a blinding sun, all bathed
in a warm coating of HDR lighting.
It feels wonderful, coming in from
the cold to be greeted with TDU’s
sunbathed highways.
But of course, the real stars of the
game are the cars! TDU boasts over
a hundred cars and motorcycles,
coming in the exotic wallet-nuking
variety (Lamborghinis, Ferraris,
McLarens, Astons), the affordable
but likeable (Audis, Nissans, Lo-
tuses) and the obscure wonders
(Koenigsegg, Ascari, Spyker).
Each car is exquisitely detailed.
Each grill, each intake, each brake
pad has been lovingly modelled.
The interior of each car has been
given the same tender care. Seats
so well made you feel comfortable
just by looking at them; proper tex-
tures for leather, wood, and plastic;
adjustable ride height and distance
from steering wheel; and colours
according to each manufacturer’s
actual specifications. The cars are
indeed beautiful things, that island
paradise I talked about above sim-
ply pales in comparison to which-
ever car you’re driving.
A key aspect about TDU that’s dif-
ferent from other racing or driving
games is that much more emphasis
is placed on how the car feels, rath-
er than how it performs. Each car
feels different, and takes getting
used to. This is a rather abstract
thing, and is best experienced first
hand. It plays an important part in
the game, helping you choose cars,
and win races.
A Ferrari requires your full un-
divided attention and precise ma-
noeuvring, for example, while a
Lamborghini feels rock solid but
not as nimble. These are the sort
of things you can ‘feel’ in each car.
Races are won more by knowing
how a car performs and knowing
which car to use than knowing how
to drive it well. But rest assured,
the level of driving aid is adjustable,
and these beautiful machines can
be as easy or as hard to drive as you
like.
Obviously, getting your hands
on these Things Of Never-ending
Beauty™ will take some effort. Your
chosen character arrives in Oahu
with nothing but enough cash for a
house and a car. You begin by buy-
ing those, and then proceed to go
out and look for work.
Work comes in the form of races,
time challenges, speed challenges,
and delivery missions. The latter
gives the most cash, but takes the
longest to complete. You can also
participate in official or player cre-
ated online challenges against oth-
er people.
Or you could simply drive up to
another player and flick your head-
lights. If he/she accepts, you then
agree on an ending point, and away
you go on an impromptu race.
After collecting enough money,
you can either buy another house
(when your current one runs out of
garage space), buy a car, or upgrade
or repaint an existing car. This is
done by driving to the appropriate
building somewhere on the island.
The car and bike dealerships are
spread out and the tuner shops
are hidden until you drive by them.
Since this island is huge (1000 miles
of road), you can teleport to any lo-
cation you’ve been to before.
This compulsive circle of race,
buy, race some more should be
enough to keep all but the hardened
car-hater stuck to the game for
some time. As I’ve said, the point
of the game isn’t the racing, it’s the
ownership and driving of nice cars.
Interestingly,thegame’sperform-
ance is not affected by you playing
online. The whole game is, in a way,
offline except for the other human
drivers, in that the game is still run
locally from your computer, and not
from a far-away server. Your inter-
net connection will hardly affect
the game. It’s you and other online
players ‘populating’ the game.
PC users need not be turned off
by the prospect of playing this on
a keyboard instead of a gamepad.
The controls are simple and effec-
tive; with a full range of options
should you need to alter your steer-
ing or something else.
As of this beta, the only existing
bugs that I’ve encountered are er-
rors in the race positions counter
(quite rare) and graphical glitches
when starting the game. Both bugs
have been reported and will most
likely be fixed come release day.
This is undoubtedly one of the
best car games the PC has ever
seen. If you’ll excuse me now, I’ve
got to go and stare perversely at
more beautiful, shiny, luxurious,
powerful, fast, cars.
