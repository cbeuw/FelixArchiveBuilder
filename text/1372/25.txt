IC Women’s Rugby are great in the scrum
A close encounter of the footy kind

The improvised team was led on
to the field by captain Mooknellay,
who maintains a bizarre attraction
to women of the ‘terminally preg-
nant’ variety, although let us not un-
derestimate the effects of gravity!
Like a drug fuelled rave, the game
kicked off in the usual frenetic fash-
ion and despite the lack of artificial
drugs, the referee was certainly a
dope worth shooting.
With King’s taking advantage
of our ‘settling period’, we relied
on the defensive efforts of Henrik,
Peter, Cody, Rob and Sang to deny
them any leverage. A cross from
the left served as the catalyst for
our equilibrium when a penalty was
awarded for an alleged hand-ball.
The spot-kick was nonchalantly
converted by top Bola Bola seed
Hamish, whose thirst for booze is
so intense, theories of how he used
to spike his mother’s shoulder boul-
ders during breast feeding are now
being realised.
We subsequently took command
of the match, with James Platt ap-
plying a neat finish to double our
lead. Moments later, the ball was
effortlessly worked down the right
allowing me to play a neat ball into
Damien to shoot straight at the
Kings No.1. Fortunately the keeper
developed an instantaneous bout
of H5N1 as he flapped wildly at ball
but to no avail.
3-0 up in the opening 25 minutes
came as both a blessing and a curse
as complacency began to creep in.
The medics put up a fight by slotting
home a goal when their lone striker
was cleanly played in. Kings were
allowed further reprieve when they
were awarded an indirect free kick
in our area when Henrik allegedly
held onto the ball for longer than
6 seconds. Kings’ placed attempt
crept into the bottom corner and it
was not long before they eventually
levelled it when their striker was
played in again to somehow dink in
a third.
The comical Medic comeback
was complete as our composure
took a combustible form. However
I must now prohibit the progres-
sive prostitution of this particular
portion of prose since it is prone to
provoke proclamations that my pro-
verbial prop and much prophesised
procurement of promiscuous ladies
are mere propaganda.
A half time score line reminiscent
of the FA Cup final meant eve-
rything was still to play for. How-
ever, given the depth of tactical
knowledge within the team, such a
half-time outcome had been proph-
esised only days earlier, allowing us
to employ the strategy often used
by cannibal’s, whereby male vic-
tims are shown porn in the hope of
enticing additional sustenance. The
bait was set, and while Kings of-
fered little in the way of ‘additional
sustenance’, the approach played
out to perfection.
Severalopportunitieswerecarved
out along with potential penalties
for blatant hand balls. Such was the
consistency of penalty claims that it
was clear the medical practice for
testicular cancer awareness was
merely to disguise their fondness
for fondling balls in the box. And it
was not long after the restart that
the ball was scrambled into the air
before falling to the head of Chris
Killin to nod towards a scarcely
defended net, only for a deliberate
hand ball to deny us the lead.
Inevitably a penalty was awarded
with their player narrowly escaping
a red. Mooknellay, whose penchant
for sea mammals can only be de-
scribed by Hooke’s Law, whereby
net much to our relief.
With 15 minutes to go, we even-
tually finished the game off when
Damien broke down the left side of
midfield to carry the ball down the
line before cutting inside to deliver
a devastating finish.
The Mook had the opportunity to
complete the hat-trick when he too
broke free down the left leaving him
one-on-one with the keeper. Unfor-
tunately he placed his shot almost
as wide as some of his most recent
conquests, who along with being
capable of whistling bass, bring a
whole new meaning to the ‘Miss
World’ competition.
Kings eventually began to tire,
with their breathing becoming so
heavy, even Hamish was getting
aroused. Their demoralised and
out-classed disposition gradually
stiffness is directly related to load,
once again calmly converted. Kings
predictably pulled another goal out
the hat when a near post cross was
flicked into the back of the net.
The referee, whose logic would
persuade him to kill for a Nobel
Peace Prize and whose grumpiness
voiced many a lonely night play-
ing peek-a-boo with the one-eyed
monster started to get agitated as
Frampton was shown the yellow for
some wholly deserved back chat.
We once again took the lead via
a free kick, lofted deftly into the
box by James from the right hand
corner of the box. Kings’ offside
ploy backfired when several of our
player came charging into the box
without a Kings player in sight. The
ball ultimately came off Tim and
crept into the bottom corner of the
developed symptoms when Dam-
ien pulled away from the last man
and chipped the keeper who made
every effort to play the man and
was subsequently sent-off. Several
further yellows were awarded to
the opposition for their petulance
before the final whistle.
The ten goal thriller did much to
bolster our waning confidence and
provide an opportunity for me to
dedicate this report to Mooknellay,
thus ensuring my complete exile
from 6th team football, and rank
No.2 in his hit list, behind Jamie
Oliver.
As if student humour is limited
to crude innuendo and shallow
prejudiced views based on ap-
pearance. Shame on you! Besides,
match reports aren’t meant to be
entertaining!

Oh look, a sports team huddled around a table consuming beverages, how quaint
This week saw us driving to Egham
to compete in our penultimate ULU
league game of the season. Our
opposition: Royal Holloway, who
turned out to be quite a large side
and clearly unfit shown by their
request for 30 minute halves! The
match was played with uncontest-
ed scrums, after our lack of expe-
rienced props following injuries 2
weeks previously in a clash against
the Royal Vets.
The game got off to a good start
with a kick from Roxanne and the
first try being scored in relatively
quick succession by Jess, who
broke free and ran the pitch to score
in the corner of the try area. Score:
5-0 to us. The kick back to us went
far down the pitch meaning full-
back Jess had to run to collect it. At
this point she managed to kick and
fumble with the ball, before falling
over her own feet. Happily, the half
finished 10-nil up, after a brilliant
off-load from Olga, allowing Louisa
to run free and score, although next
time Louisa please score under the
posts when there is no-one prevent-
ing you from doing so! The second
half started off with a very clean
catch by Helen, allowing us to run
back at them with some force.
Unfortunately, Royal Holloway
were obviously looking to even the
score and fought back hard, man-
aging to score and then convert a
try taking the score up to 10-7. This
was followed shortly by a second
try from the home side making the
score 10-12 to Royal Holloway. At
some point during the match, Rox-
anne expressed her feelings quite
openly to their coach, who was
shouting very loudly from the side-
lines and leading to a lot of confu-
sion as to what the ref was or wasn’t
saying! Thankfully, he calmed down
a bit following this outburst from a
rather red-faced Roxanne.
Eight minutes towards the end of
the game, the Virgins were fight-
ing back excellently, which led to a
virgin try from outside centre Zoë.
Score: 15-12 with 5 minutes left to
go.
Then followed a nerve-racking 5
minuteswheretheVirginsmanaged
to hold the home team away from
our line in a strong contest for the
match. Thankfully, the whistle blew
for full-time allowing ICUWRFC to
relax and enjoy the hard-won vic-
tory, before heading off to the pub
to celebrate and enjoy the free-food
laid on by Royal Holloway.
