Election candidate ‘slate’ causes stir
A group of Southwell Hall residents have allegedly formed a ‘party’ to stand for all the sabbatical positions
Reports have reached Felix of a
group of students who have formed
a ‘party’ to stand for each of the
available sabbatical positions in the
upcoming elections.
The students, who are all resi-
dents of Southwell Halls, have been
dubbed ‘the Southwell Slate’ by
senior Union sources. They have
also drawn ridicule from a number
of Union officers, who have com-
mented to Felix of the lack of expe-
rience that the group exhibit.
The group has even gone as far as
to set up a Facebook group named
“Giannuzzi 2007” after their Presi-
dential candidate, Jules Giannuzzi.
However, this group has been en-
couraging its members to vote for
the Slate, breaking the election
rules in the Union Constitution, as
this can be seen as “campaigning
prior to close of nominations”. The
maximum penalty for breaching
this rule is disqualification from the
election.
However, those involved have
now been sent a warning by the
sabbaticals after it was spotted by
a Union officer, and the group has
been cleared of any posts. It is un-
likely any further action will be tak-
en against the candidates.
The Facebook group now says
“this group is in the process of clos-
ing down”. The group at one point
contained more than 60 members,
including those who had been invit-
ed but not accepted membership.
Sources close to the group have
told Felix that the Deputy Presi-
dent candidates are, in our source’s
words, “in it for a laugh”. However,
Mr Giannuzzi’s Facebook status
is rather provocatively currently
set as “Giannuzzi is President and
divine leader”. It also appears the
group may have recruited a mem-
ber to stand for Felix Editor, though
this is unconfirmed.
The current sabb team have also
expressed concern over the lack
of experienced Presidential candi-
dates. It was expected that at least
one seasoned officer would stand,
but so far the majority of the candi-
datesareunknowninUnionpolitics.
However, there were rumours that
the current Deputy President (Fi-
nance & Services), Jon Matthews
would stand; he was confirmed as
a Presidential candidate just before
going to press.
The other candidates standing
for President at the time of going
to press are Sophie Spillard, Diogo
Geraldes, Eric Lai (current Deputy
President, Clubs & Societies), and
Ben Schneider.
Nominations close on Tuesday
13 February, and campaigning will
begin after this. Felix would like to
remind readers that the Union Con-
stitution requires that you think be-
fore you vote.
The candidates’ manifestos will
appear in Felix, and will be avail-
able on the web at the same time.
Details of how to second candidates
can be found at www.imperialcol-
legeunion.org/vote.

Union Executive discusses
future of Deputy President
(Graduate Students) role
In the wake of the censure mo-
tion against the Deputy President
(Graduate Students), Shama Rah-
man,theUnionExecutivediscussed
the future of the role yesterday.
The Council has already voted not
to elect a DPGS this year, in antici-
pation of a review of the position.
A paper jointly written by John
Collins, Union President, and Ms
Rahman was discussed by the Ex-
ecutive at length. The paper focus-
es on the current problems with the
DPGS position, including the place-
ment as a Deputy President, incur-
ring both the responsibility of being
chair of the GSA (Graduate Stu-
dents Association, representing all
postgraduates) as well as the usual
day-to-day tasks of being a Deputy
President.
It also focusses on the problems
that have dogged the previous two
incumbents of the post, Luis Hui
and Ms Rahman. Both faced dif-
ficulty in getting training prior to
taking up their posts, as they were
completely their masters during
the handover period in July-Au-
gust, and could only spend one day
a week (if that) at work.
The paper says that the DPGS po-
sition has faced “intense scrutiny”
from the student media (in other
words, Felix and Live!), as well as
from senior volunteer officers, who
feel the job does not warrant a full-
time sabbatical position. ‘Demoting’
this position to a paid volunteer lev-
el should “reduce the level of scru-
tiny to that of a CSC [Club & Society
Chair] or Faculty Union President
level,” as the paper puts it.
The paper suggests removing the
DPGS post and replacing it with a
number of paid volunteer posts.
There would a President of the GSA,
subsuming one of Ms Rahman’s
roles, and two Vice Presidents (VP
of Research Students, and VP of
Taught Students). The significant
sum of money given to the Union
to fund the DPGS position in the
subvention (around £28,000) would
be used to pay these volunteer of-
ficers, with the extra being plowed
back into the GSA to add to the cur-
rent funding received from the cen-
tral Union for events.
A number of those present at the
meeting raised concerns over hav-
ing paid volunteer officers; no other
volunteers are paid for their work.
Mr Collins outlined the reasons for
the positions being paid, saying that
they would replace demonstrating
and teaching work for the postgrad-
uate officer concerned, and would
pay about the same as the former
would. This, he said, would encour-
age PhD students to stand for the
volunteer positions. Many, includ-
ing the CSC Chairs, vehemently
disagreed with this proposal, ar-
guing that it would create tension
between the unpaid undergraduate
volunteers and the paid postgradu-
ate volunteers.
Ben Harris (Deputy President,
Education & Welfare) explained
that the DPGS role could not be
removed without providing some
equivalent support structure for
postgraduates, or, as he put it, Col-
lege would defecate on the Union
from a great height. The drive for
the DPGS position came from Col-
lege, after a QAA review found that
postgraduate welfare support was
poor. Presumably, a failure to suita-
bly replace the DPGS role would re-
sult in College removing the £28,000
from the subvention.
The Executive seemed resolved
to removing the full-time DPGS
position.
Centenary balloon race ends
The Union’s Centenary balloon race is complete, with the winning
balloon being sent back from Oberzeuzheim, almost 350 miles from
the launch point at Beit Quad. Other balloons made it as far as the
Essex and Kent, though most ended up in East London.
