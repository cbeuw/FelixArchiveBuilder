Firstly, apologies for last week’s
crossword. Even for a first at-
tempt that came out worse than
I’d hoped. However, it did result in
one of the highest responses ever,
and special thanks to those who
went so far as to suggest a clue for
the one I’d missed out. Really, I
appreciated it even though you got
the word wrong.
Moving onto this week, I hope
that it comes out as something a
bit harder this time round. In hon-
our of international ‘That’s What
She Said Day’ next week, some
of the clues have a mild innuendo
theme. Others are just blantatly
vulgar and rude. Try not to be
offended.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
“No Way!” “Oh No He
Didn’t!” “You better
recognise!” “You’re in
for a reality check!”
These are just some
of the phrases you
will find in my new book, Insults in
Ghetto N’am sayin’, Edition 3 by
Cecil Custard-Smythe available in
hardback and humpback whale.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
This week you will
come into some
money. This habit is
disgusting and unhy-
gienic for those who
will have to handle
your banknotes. So, you better
shape up, ‘cause I need a man, and
my heart is set on you. You’re the
one that I want ooh ooh ooh.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
I was once allowed
to touch a small
child, but only in an
emergency. I was sat
outside that creche for
12 days until I saw that
little bastard choking. And that, my
friend is the story of how I got my
first tattoo. This week, you will find
love.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
Yeah, you see that
guy over there? No,
not the guy with the
Mastadon T-shirt, the
other guy. D’you know
what he’s thinking
about? Yeah, he’s thinking about
touching you. No, not there, just
next to your... yeah, you got it. I
hope you like creamy pastries.
This Week’s Philanthropes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
You go back home this
weekend and your
mum tells you to go
through your stuff in
the attic. After you
descend, you find that
apes have taken over the world and
you are forced to construct a house
out of pate de foie gras. Happy
birthday Smithers for Monday!
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
Girls Aloud will be
appearing in your
lounge tonight! Well,
maybe. I mean, well,
it could happen, but
chances are, it won’t.
Here, have this novelty mug! Look,
when you put hot water in it, her
bra comes off! Erm, you will not
have sex for at least 0.005 seconds.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
And the Lord descend-
ed and He spoke to
the thronging masses,
and He said, “Ooooh
eeeeh blimey I tell
thee, it ain’t half borin’
in ‘eaven like. Full of poncey goody
know-it-alls. Here, have some rain-
ing sulphur! Oh crap, I mean sugar.
My bad!” – God: Outtakes 21:2-3
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Toilet paper, fabric
softener, orange juice,
cereal, sliced ham,
baby wipes... just
some of the items on
your parent’s shop-
ping list in the next month. Yeah, I
know what you’re thinking: “How
did he do that?” Well, I just use my
penis as a divining rod.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
It’s the age-old ques-
tion: Are you a breast
or a arse kind of
guy? But, what is the
ladies’ version of this?
Are you a bum or cock
type of girl? This is easy as penises
are very ugly to look at. This is why
patriarchy existed for so long: the
ladies just had no choice.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
No, because like, you
know you better watch
your back because it’s
a dog-eat-dog world,
and, my friend, you’re
a three-legged blind
puppy with excema. So, buy a rape
alarm and a fucking huge gun that
goes POW BOOOM. This week
Mars is in Uranus. HAHAHAHA!
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
I would do anything
for love, I’d run right
into hell and back.
BUM BUM. I would do
anything for love, I’ll
never lie to you and
that’s a fact. BUM BUM. And I will
do anything for love but I won’t do
ass-to-mouth. BUM BUM. Okay,
maybe just once.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
After realising you
are not Gemini, but in
fact, Cancer, you are
perturbed by the last
horoscope. You e-mail
Felix only to get a
response saying, “Fuck you, I’m
the boss!” You think nothing of this,
and forget about the incident. We
fucking wish, leave us alone!!!
