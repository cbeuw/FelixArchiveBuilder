aming chat-up lines.
They must exist.
There are math-
ematical formulae
that more or less
prove their existence. But after an
hour and a half of drafting, in be-
tween bouts of getting my lesbian
rejected by her clearly confused
co-worker on The Sims, I’ve not
come up with much better than
the kind of joystick innuendos
that even we wouldn’t print.
I’m sure there’s a Zelda one
somewhere, though.
It’s Valentine’s Day soon, of
course – imminently so, in fact,
and if you haven’t already planned
out what you’re going to do on
the fourteenth (and yes, mutter-
ing swear words whilst drowning
your sorrows at the Union does
count as a plan) then you’re cut-
ting it a bit fine.
Fortunately, we’ve got every-
thing you could possibly need
to make the most of the year’s
most impressive non-holiday.
Looking for gifts? We’ve got Prin-
cess Peach costumes and Mario
chocolates. Still looking for that
Zombie of your dreams? We look
into picking up chicks in World
of Warcraft. Trying to get as far
away from it as possible? Well…
You’re a gamer. Use your
imagination.
For the record, however, we’re
not entirely sure that a trip
through Azeroth counts as third
date material for the Electrical
Engineer you met at the start of
term, and we’d also like to sug-
gest you exercise caution when
giving kinky game-related para-
phenalia to the girlfriend who’s
worried you love Gears of War
more than her.
In fact, if we admit it, Valen-
tine’s isn’t a day for per-pixel
shaders and +5% rebuffs at the
moment. But one day in the fu-
ture, when everyone’s given up
with sunshine and kittens and
things like that, we’re fairly sure
that gaming will be the ultimate
expression of love.
Then who’ll be laughing, eh?
In the meantime, probably best
to find something to occupy your-
self with. Test Drive Unlimited
is doing the trick for some of us
at the moment, as you can read
about in our latest Endurance
feature.
Wait, wait, I’ve got one.
“Are you up for some multiplay-
er? It’s just you’ve been pushing
my start button all night.”
Email your results in, it’s a
flawless line. Failing that, just
give her the old, ‘Left Triangle
Bracket Three’ line. She’ll get it
eventually.
<3 Your Valentine

This Week In Relationships
T
empting though it is
to turn this week into
a faux-love advice col-
umn, we felt we couldn’t
do it when the console
war was still so depressingly gory.
The latest good news is that you
can now pre-order your very own
Playstation3 in the UK at HMV on-
line. They’ve only got 5,000 pre-or-
ders available to fill at the moment,
but they’re excited to be able to of-
fer them to gamers.
The downside, of course, is that
it requires you to buy a PSP along-
side it, and the entire package sets
you back nearly £700. This news
was announced at the weekend just
as analysts forecast price drops in
the US because of poor sales. God
knows what HMV are trying to do,
but we’re unsure it’s going to be all
that successful.
Thankfully,thePCmarketismuch
calmer, with the release of Windows
Vista making things calm, peaceful,
and inducing a trance-like loving
mood amongst all of PC-kind.
Ah. Well, it did for a little while,
anyway. The box looked nice, the
features looked shiny, but before
you know it the internet is explod-
ing and lawsuits are flying.
At the time of going to press,
nVidia are still under the threat of
legal action after failing to provide
adequate support for Vista. After
an update of their drivers failed to
provide any for the new operating
system, several lawsuits were al-
legedly filed against them, though
support has since been promised.
See www. nvidiaclassaction.org for
more information.
But class action lawsuits are a
small distraction compared to the
claim that nine out of ten PC games
from the pre-Vista era will refuse
to run on Microsoft’s latest. De-
spite claims of new hardware being
‘Vista Ready’ and various software
solutions having been in place for
months prior to beta testing, a ma-
jor game publisher claimed that
due to botched digital rights man-
agement, and complex attempts
at keeping system security, most
games will be rendered unplayable
on the next-generation OS.
As an example, the ESRB rat-
ings protection that has been built
into Vista was cited as another ex-
ample of badly-implemented ‘user
protection’. The system, supposed
to allow parents to set levels of
games that can be played on chil-
dren’s accounts, hasn’t been fully
implemented across the gaming
world, meaning that almost every
internet-based game is blocked by
the technology, regardless of the
rating level set. Obtaining ESRB
Stuffed toys, chocolate, and the 2007’s first releases. It’ll all be over by Christmas
rating for a single game costs $2500
– not something that the average
internet developer is going to be at-
tempting any time soon.
The dust is still settling on the re-
lease, and problems were expected
with a software leap of this magni-
tude. But with Gates’ dream of an
integrated 360 and PC platform rid-
ing on the success of Vista, it seems
that Nintendo are the only ones
having a good week.
It’s been a slow January, but it
seems like publishers have real-
ised that the New Year has begun
and finally decided to start throw-
ing some games out. First up on the
recommendations list for this week
is the brilliant Okami for the Play-
station2 – a weird yet wonderful
game with beautiful visuals and a
strange platforming-cum-rhythm-
action hook.
Every Extend Extra and Bomber-
man arrive on the PSP if you’re look-
ing for a quick distraction over the
Love Season, or there’s the more
engaging Battlestations:Midway, a
tour of the great naval and aerial
battles of World War 2, out on XBox
360 and PC. The month is looking to
be a good one, with Supreme Com-
Love, yesterday. This was going to be a dig at geeks, until we realised he’s wearing a FireFox tee. Git
