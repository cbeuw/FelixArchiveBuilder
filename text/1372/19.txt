G
amers need love too.
No matter what any-
one else says, the signs
are all there – the sec-
ond unused port on a
SNES. That co-op mode that never
gets played. The extra saddle on
your steed? We can see it, we know
it’s a cry for help.
But then there are the gamers
who’ve already found love. They’ve
got their party formed and locked,
they’ve found their henchman,
Player 2 has entered the game. And
so on, and other slightly strange
metaphors.
Whether it’s Lara Croft or the
girl who’s always late to Monday
afternoon lectures, everyone needs
some love on Valentine’s day.
So here’s our complete guide to a
perfect day of love. If you’re in the
mood for something more virtual,
we’ve got that covered, too, with
a tour of World of Warcraft’s most
romantic locations, just over the
page.
But for now, it’s time for gaming
to show it’s pinker side, as Felix
Games delves into the murk and
brings you the lovey-dovey cen-
tre hiding behind the geek facade.
We’re all traditional romantics at
heart, really.

A
s everyone knows, the
basics for Valentine’s
day are simple – choco-
late, a card, and some-
thing romantic. Since
the average gamer has spent all
too much free time collecting coins,
hostages and small fruits, we’re
sure that a little searching should
be no trouble for you.
First you’ll want some kind of sick-
ly sweet-based gift. Heart-shaped
chocolates are boring, what girls re-
ally want is for you to show just how
seasoned a gamer you are, so head
on over to StrapYa! and you’ll find
a delightful set of Mario figurines,
some with chocolate inside mystery
boxes, some with sound effects that
play when you tap them, some with
hallucinatory drugs hidden in small
compartments. All cute enough to
give to your special someone.
Then there’s the card. Naturally,
you could make your own. But let’s
face it, you probably don’t have the
time, and your colouring skills sort
of hit a peak in Year 4. The next best
bet’s a Hallmark job, but... well...
it’s a little impersonal, and it just
doesn’t say ‘leet’ enough. Right?
Right.
Felix has this one sorted for you,
however, as we pioneer the Videog-
ame Valentine’s Card. Grab it from
our Flickr (http://flickr.com/pho-
tos/felixgames), and do with as you
wish. Pure romantic genius, you’re
well on your way to getting some
co-op action.
Now you’ve got the giveables,
it’s time to take the romantics up
a notch. We all know about looking
smart, washing the hair and what-
ever, but what really impresses peo-
ple on a day about love is dressing
up as characters from Mario Bros.
Essentially, it’s the Pride and
Prejudice of our day. Mario – a
down-and-out plumber with a dys-
functional brother and edible
friends – seeks to save the pure
It’s not that we’re against fun trinkets. It’s just the ‘sweets’ inside look a lot like smuggled ecstasy tablets
Princess Peach from the tyrrany
of a giant turtle. If you can’t see the
metaphors in that, then there’s no
hope for you. It’s a timeless love
story wrapped up in a narrative
that mainly involves Freudian pipe-
sliding and eating mushrooms.
With that in mind, you’ll want to
take a look at sites such as PinUp-
Girl in order to look the part when
you give your gifts to love interest
come the big day. Moustache op-
tional for the Princess Peach outfit,
of course, but you might like to add
it in anyway to really mix things up.
Alright, you look the part and your
inventory is full to bursting with fire
flowers. Time to get some events
organised. Here’s the tricky bit – in-
stinct tells you to try dinner, long
walks and possibly some kind of
cultural event. Sure, instinct served
you well on de_dust last Thursday
evening, but instinct when it comes
to love is just no use at all.
Two words – multiplayer gaming.
It’s essentially a one-way ticket
to the High Score screen. Open up
with a heartfelt rendition of “To-
night I’m Gonna Rock You Tonight”
on Guitar Hero, just to get every-
one in the mood, before settling
down to get a good few hours in
on Final Fantasy IX co-op, maybe
finishing up with a whirlwind tour
of Azeroth (see, “You’re My World
(Of Warcraft)” for the quick guide)
before proclaiming your love to the
mounrful OST of Ico.
If that doesn’t get you a well-
earned boss battle in the bedroom,
then you’ve obviously not followed
our advice closely enough.
Of course, not everyone’s lucky
enough to have an extra controller
this Valentine’s, so if you’re stuck
with just the AI (we’re not sure
where this metaphor’s gone now
– is that pornography? I don’t know
who I am.) then that’s okay too
– there’s always a way out.
Naturally, it’ll be easier if you’re
based in Japan, the centre of the
tacky soft-porn world.
First off, how about a dating simu-
lator? Sure, there are a lot on that
website you ‘accidentally’ stumbled
across whilst ‘researching’ about
‘Japanese culture’, but this is 2007
now, and it’s fine with everyone
if you want to delve into some ob-
scure Eastern niche genre.
Our pick has to be the soon-to-
be-released LOVE x2 KISS, for the
PSP
, which will take you and your
completely fictional girlfriend on a
holiday to the States, where you’ll
have to make a series of decisions
correctly in order to please the lady
of your dreams. It’s just like being
in a real relationship! Except with
the game, you can remember which
answers were wrong for next time.
Don’t get us wrong, we’ve got
touch-screen Hentai games for
the DS and a quite frankly bizarre
maid-management simulator for
the mobile. But we understand if
you feel a bit too sordid.
Because at the end of the day, the
only decent way to escape the ter-
ror of Valentine’s day is to escape to
a happier place, and there’s no hap-
pier than the country that spawned
a mushroom-eating Italian who
only sees in primary colours.
The Orient holds a many kitsch
delights, if you know where to
look. Cosplay cafés and hotels with
Maids dressed up as the most mi-
nor of minor characters from every
anime and mecha-game under the
Rising Sun, or just a simple Love
Hotel that’s been souped up with
rentable Playstation3s.
Whatever approach you take this
February, just remember that it’s
not just about chocolate and roses.
So if it comes to the evening of Val-
entine’s Day, and after it’s all over
you find that it’s not working out be-
tween you and that girl that seemed
so perfect not that long ago, remem-
ber that you knew Tomb Raider
was going to go downhill when you
bought Legends. Serves you right.
See? It’s not all guns and women in ridiculous clothing and stereotypes. We can be romantic, too, you shits
