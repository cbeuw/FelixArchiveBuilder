At 8am on Saturday morning, while
most of the readership were still in
bed, or just getting back to it, four-
teen intrepid members of the IC
Rifle & Pistol Club’s Clay Pigeon
teams left campus to take a trip
to Bristol & pitch our best against
what they had to offer.
The shooting on their side was
respectable, but neither our 1st or
2nd teams were interested in slack-
ing back and took the lead in both
running totals from the start. At the
end of the first part of the competi-
tion the IC 2nd, comprising James
Fok (2nd’s captain), Alan, Alex M &
Jose, had taken a strong lead with a

score of 101 against the 81 of Bristol
2nds. IC 1sts (Ayman, Paul, Dave,
and Pantelis), however, were being
made to work for victory, finishing
only 12pts ahead of Bristol 1sts (118
to 106).
The second part of the competi-
tion was Bristol’s chance to make
amends and they were eager to try,
setting aggressive benchmarks for
IC to achieve. However, dominant
shooting pushed both Imperial
teams further ahead with IC 1sts
finishing on 168 to top Bristol’s 158
and IC 2nds’ 158 completing their
railroading of Bristol 2nds (128).
The story of the day has to go to
the Bristol 1st team who, desperate
to leave with some dignity, went out

I’m confused, where is the car?
a second time to shoot the second
part of the competition in an effort
to beat IC’s highest score in that
section of 55/80. Credit to them:
they returned to applause from both
sides with a score of 61/80. However
Ayman (Clay captain) was unhappy
without a whitewash and proceed-
ed to dispatch half of the graduate
team out to give the Bristol cohort a
masterclass. Tim, Geoff, Alkesh and
Timur duly obliged, taking down
65/80 of the clay pigeons to settle
the matter once & for all. Inciden-
tally, the graduate team of IC also
beat all others with 169, pipping the
IC 1st team by a single point.
Fun was had by all who attended
& as an indicator for the BUSA na-
tionals it bodes very well. Thanks
go to Ayman for arranging the de-
tails and Tim & Geoff for coaching
all the guys. Shooting is an expen-
sive sport by any measure and the
club has been very lucky in recent
years to maintain alumni connec-
tions to coach newcomers to the
sport, which can cost upwards of
£55/hr. If you want to try this sport
at an affordable price while you still
can we’d love to hear from you! The
closeness of scores between the
best of Imperial and the best of the
graduates shows the tremendous
progress the club has made bring-
ing the standards of shooting up.
Good luck to all those competing
next month at BUSA.
