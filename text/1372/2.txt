Yummy Mario
First you’ll want some kind of sickly
sweet-based gift. Heart-shaped
chocolates are boring, what girls re-
ally want is for you to show just how
seasoned a gamer you are, so head
on over to StrapYa! and you’ll find
a delightful set of Mario figurines,
some with chocolate and a sound
that plays when you tap them,
some with hallucinatory drugs hid-
den in small compartments.

Sabb gets censured

Continued from front page
At Freshers’ Fair, Ms Rahman was
late in arriving to run the GSA stall,
and was spotted drinking the bar
when the other sabbs and volun-
teers were packing up at the end of
the Fair.
This antagonised a number of
volunteer officers present, many of
whom had been on duty since early
in the morning, and stayed until
later on in the evening to pack up.
Also, questions were asked about
Ms Rahman’s problems with budg-
et forms, with Council members
pointing out that each of the 280 vol-
unteer club officers are expected to
be able to do this.
These points had been covered in
a formal written warning issued by
the President, and in the first draft
of the no confidence motion that was
leaked to Felix. However, Ms Rah-
man’s late arrival to the important
SEC (Strategic Education Commit-
tee) meeting, where she had been
due to give a presentation about the
PhD funding increase (which was
later made by Ben Harris), and a
failure to submit the GSA budget on
time, both occured after the no con-
fidence motion had been submitted.
Many of those present commented
to Felix that this showed a lack of
regard for her current situation.
Ms Rahman had many explana-
tions for her poor timekeeping and
attendence, citing building works
and illness as two, and was very
apologetic for some of the trans-
gressions alleged in the paper, her
voice almost breaking at times.
As the meeting continued, the
questioning softened somewhat,
with Council acknowledging the
good work Ms Rahman has done in
organising events for the fledgling
GSA, and in promoting the GSA
brand to PGs. As such, Ben Harris
(Deputy President, Education &
Welfare) suggested a move to cen-
sure, rather than no confidence.
Several hawkish Council mem-
bers seemed unhappy with this –
one pointed out that this wasn’t the
first warning Ms Rahman has re-
ceived (there have been some ver-
bal warnings, and a written warn-
ing), and that she had had enough
chances.
The doves, however, argued that
the removal of Shama might signal
death for the GSA, which has only
existed for two years. There were
also concerns expressed over what
message such a move would send
to the postgraduate student body.
After an almost four hour meet-
ing, the move to censure was ap-
proved by Council. Voting on the
censure took place by secret ballot;
Ms Rahman did not return to hear
the result.
A number of Council members
approached by Felix said they voted
for the move to censure as they felt
a no confidence motion would fall,
leaving no official consequences.
Concerns over the functioning of
the sabb team after censure seem,
for the moment, unfounded. John
Collins commented: “It feels like a
great dark cloud has been lifted.”
The College email service had a
brief fit last Friday, spamming al-
most every student with old emails
from mailing lists.
The emails were from student
mailing lists used by Union Presi-
dents, as well as Faculty Union-
wide mailing lists and College-
wide lists They began arriving
late on Friday afternoon, causing
a number of students’ inboxes to
overflow. The messages were arriv-
ing from previous Union President,
Sameena Misbahuddin, previous
CGCU President, Sid Singh, CGCU
President James Fok, the Imperial
College Health Centre, the Rector,
Sir Richard Sykes, and even the
current President, John Collins.
The emails concerned everything
College email fault
“System error” causes old emails to be resent to almost every
student in the College, filling inboxes and raising tempers
from last year’s sabb elections to
mumps, and some even covered
last year’s NUS referendum.
The torrent of email trickled off
by the end of the day, with only a
trickle of emails arriving in this
editor’s inbox by 10pm, including
two messages about an entrepre-
neur’s challenge, and one from Mr
Collins.
Mr Collins has received “a large
amount” of angry emails from stu-
dents who received his own emails,
presuming him to be responsible.
An exasperated Mr Collins could be
seen stalking the corridors of Beit
Towers on Friday evening, unhap-
py that he’d been given the blame
unjustifiably.
Mr Collins also said ICT’s conduct
had been less than satisfactory. He
did not receive a full explanation for
the error, and received no notifica-
tion that there was a problem until
he contacted ICT after receiving
the angry missives of upset stu-
dents with full inboxes.
ICT have now fixed the problem,
it seems. When contact by CGCU
President James Fok in regards
to some of his past emails being
resent, ICT Service Desk respond-
ed: “Due to a system error, many
messages that were send to some
distribution lists were re-sent to-
day. The monitoring of the system
showed that this has now ceased.
Please accept our apologies for
any inconvenience this may have
caused you.”
