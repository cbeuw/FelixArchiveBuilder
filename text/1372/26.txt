Friday, January the 19th
saw the
RSM mixed hockey assembled at
Stanstead airport as ready as they
ever would be for their tour to Hol-
land. It would prove to be one hell of
a trip! With hockey high on the list of
sports played by the Dutch(second
only to football), we were under no
illusions that the game would be an
easy one.
Under the watchful eyes of Sam
and Sammy we found our way to
the hostel and the following day to
the playing grounds known as the
Liedseplene. We had all made our
own preparations and run through
set pieces including the bubble
gum and haze moves ready to face
The Bulldogs.
It was a shaky start for Steve and
Kate, being new to the sport; But
they found their legs quickly while
the old hands Mikey and Charlotte
drove forwards and set the pace.
We were unlucky not to score
early on considering the territory
we had over the opposition. Ben
started to regret that ridiculously
over-sized Burger King the night
before – but only briefly judging by
the equally large meal consumed
post match.
Unfortunately after the initial
forward drive, the Dutch picked up
their game in a way that suggested
some sort of stimulating drugs.
Just 15 mins in, a goal was slipped
despite Kieran’s best efforts in goal
and Ally’s impressive determina-
tion in defence.
This set back caused a few of the
RSM to let their chins drop at first
but Alice made the call to look back
up and restart the drive. It was a dif-
ficult few minutes but Tim made a

(5 - 4 after penalties)
RSM have progressed to the semi-
final stage of the ULU Men’s Re-
serve Cup for the first time in bloody
ages, thanks to two stunning victo-
ries against those unpleasant viral
outbreaks known as ‘medics’. Fol-
lowing our league success against
Barts 3rds the same week, the gen-
tlemen’s club that is RSM Hockey
went into the first round full of con-
fidence (and port). The addition of
Richie D to the side meant the mid-
field resembled that of a World XI,
with star players from across the
country coming together in an orgy
of hockey brilliance.
Barts 2nds could only stand and
watch in awe as silky interchanging
play, ‘sixth sense’ movement off the
ball and Ben’s charging runs down
the left wing tore their defence to
pieces, and 28 microseconds into
the game Leon scored off a perfect-
ly-executed short corner routine.
More was to come as consistent and
unrelenting pressure lead to cor-
ner after corner, and when Mikey
flicked the ball over a stranded
keeper the Miners began to sense
that victory would surely be theirs.
However, to Barts’ credit they man-
aged to earn a shortie of their own,
and (mostly out of compassion) we
conceded. This was to be Kiran’s
only lapse in a come-back perform-
ance that Wilko himself would have
been proud of. The second half saw
more great work from a dynamic
defence, well-oiled midfield and ag-
gressive attack; Tim fired a free hit
in for Leon to deflect through the
keeper’s legs, and Mikey put Barts’
Cup hopes to death with a fourth.
Cue post-match celebrations, more
port, streaking, and a few tears
from the Barts captain.
Another week, another round,
and RSM found themselves up
against an in-form George’s side -
unfortunately, a little too much fun
the night before meant that RSM
defence lacked its usual finesse,
and Tom seemed to play the first
half for the wrong team.
Man of the Match, Jackson, held
things together, and we were fortu-
nate to concede just two soft first-
half goals. A half-time half-bottle of
port sorted Tom out a treat, and a
rousing (arousing?) team talk from
El Capitan put the fire back into
the side. Timmaay slotted the first
in from a short, and Sam ‘thieving
bastard’ Lloyd latched onto a shot
from TFC to square things up. A
few frantic minutes in our own D
kept the game alive as the whistle
blew for full time, and the support-
ers nearly wet themselves with ex-
citement at the prospect of a pen-
alty shoot-out.
Captain’s first choice was Mikey
(who, given his previous record for
Cup flicks, probably wasn’t such a
good idea), followed by Tom, Pete,
Sam, and The Great Man Himself.
Mikey duly lived up to his reputation
by putting his shot so wide it nearly
reached the sideline. Ade in goal did
us proud with some fine saves, but
after five each the scores were tied
at two apiece. The tension mounted
as the shoot-out entered the sud-
den death stage. Mikey fluffed his
second attempt but sent the keeper
the wrong way and got it on target;
the crowd went wild as it trickled
over the line. Tom and Pete had no
such trouble and Grobbelaar-like
distraction tactics by Ade ensured
that the opposition Captain cracked
under the pressure. Hail Victory
and look forward to more enticing
Cup action on February 18th!
Special thanks to new guys Adam
and Steve, Ben and Tom for making
the effort, Pikey for playing with a
broken wrist, Pikey for not playing
with a broken ankle, Pete for travel-
ling down especially, etc., etc., you
know who you all are.

break up the right wing leaving the
ground behind him smoking; RSM
were back in the opposition’s half.
After much vocal activity from for-
wards Katie and Elly, the ball was in
scoring territory and with some of
the best support seen all weekend,
Mikey was able to roll a beautiful
one in at the back post.
The rest of the half saw some
good play from everyone but no
more joy was seen. Going in at half
time drawing one all, we were in
relatively high spirits. As we all took
on water during the break, Ben and
Elly decided that in the absence of
orange wedges, which Susie bluntly
described as “f***ing disgraceful”,
bananas were clearly the way to
motor forward.
As the second half began the girls
found a seemingly magical hole in
the defence and tunnel vision en-
sued. This focus resulted in Pete
getting a screamer in the top cor-
ner as if that white ball was drawn
in by gravity. Once again Charlotte
made a push forward, setting the
standard with a long sprint, the type
which makes you feel like you’re go-
ing to vomit. A quick one-two with
Katie resulted in our third goal and
Ally kindly fetched the tired Char-
lotte some water.
The Dutch team were obviously
starting to lose faith in themselves
with silly mistakes becoming com-
mon unfortunately RSM’s lack of
fitness meant we were unable to
score again. Still, when the final
whistle went we were the victors; 3
points to 1.
Achieving this result in a foreign
country where the RSM is almost
unknown means we will be proud
for years to come.
The only appropriate way to cel-
ebrate the victory was, of course,
in the “traditional” RSM manner-
getting wasted and “drinking” lots
of “coffee”... or something like that
anyway.
Hurrah for team photographs! Good ol’ dependable hockey teams. You can write in again
