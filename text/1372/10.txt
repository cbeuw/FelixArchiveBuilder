Do, Make, Shins Think?
This week we take a look at the new Do Make Say Think and Shins albums
Drummers, drummers, drummers.
If you have ever been in a band or
tried to form a band, you’ll know that
trying to find a drummer is like try-
ing to find reason amongst a group
of fundamentalist Christians. When
I stumble across a group with more
than one (good) drummer, it really
does make me ponder how long it
must have taken to find skin beat-
ers of such quality in a non-singular
amount, or in simpler terms, wow.
Another thing I am a sucker for
is horns, and I love me a good horn
section like a pig enjoys wallowing
in its own muck. If horns and two
drummers collide, only perfec-
tion can come from it; go listen to
Soeza (from Bristol and on Gringo
Records) and you will understand
my point completely. Do Make Say
Think employ both the use of two
drummers and a mighty horn sec-
tion and make the kind of trium-
phant music that if those aforemen-
tioned Christians played it to you,
you’d be converted in an instant
and demand the rapture.
Do Make Say Think are part of
the Constellation Records collec-
tive which exist out of Montreal
and contains many a band that has
something to do with Godspeed
You! Black Emperor. However, Do
Make Say Think – of Toronto, On-
tario in Canada – have very little to
do with Godspeed, and this makes
them rather refreshing amongst
most of the Constellation gathering.
For those who like their Canadian
indie-pop, key-players in Do Make
Say Think, Ohad Benchetrit and
Charles Spearin are also in Broken
Social Scene. Therefore, Do Make
Say Think actually know about cre-
ating one of those things they call,
erm, melodies.
Enough scene-setting, I want to
talk about this album. You, You’re
A History In Rust is Do Make Say
Think’s first album in about 4 years
and what is remarkable about it
is that is contains vocals, but you
are probably wondering why this
is remarkable. Well, in the past, Do
Make Say Think were lobbed – un-
derstandably in some senses – in
the genre pit they call post-rock be-
cause they made instrumental mu-
sic that in some instances rocked.
However, where post-rock can be
seen to be miserable semi-compe-
tent musicians pummelling away
at the same riff until their hands
fall off (see Mono’s last album), Do
Make Say Think were inventive and
inclusive in their instrumental rock
calling upon the Jazz gods and the
spirit of Can. Now with You, You’re
A History In Rust they are incorpo-
rating vocals, but only on two of the
six tracks, and it really does make
sense.
It makes sense because if you go
and listen to their previous albums,
you notice that there is a cohesive
sound to the music: Goodbye En-
emy Airship The Landlord Is Dead
has an angular, repetitive cold
texture to it which truly reflects
2000, also the year of Shellac’s 1000
Hurts which sported a harsh and
cold sound; & Yet & Yet sported a
brighter and looser jazz feel at a
time of fear in North America (early
2002), this album reflected a move
away from harsh and simple tones
to more improvisation-based music
with sample manipulation in the un-
derground scene inspired by bands
such as Tortoise, and more closer-
to-home acts such as Four Tet
getting recognition; Winter Hymn
Country Hymn Secret Hymn, re-
leased in 2003, hinted at more pas-
toral and folk-inspired tones yet
retained a harsh edge as heard on
Goodbye Enemy… with a string

W
ell, well, well I
bet you missed
your music sec-
tion haven’t
you? What? No,
you didn’t? Well, that just hurts in
so many ways you’ll never under-
stand. Anyway, we’ll kick back into
action with two pages of reviews
and an interview with some band
called The View. I hear they are
the NME’s next best thing since
last week, so I will probably fol-
lowing their career with great
ignorance.
Enough morose behaviour, I
was tired of bad music getting
coverage and not enough atten-
tion being given to good music,
so I reviewed the new Do Make
Say Think album which is out on
Monday. I hope you aren’t put off
by my hyperbole but if you have
followed the successive albums
they put out sporadically then you
should be excited. They tip-toe
across the line between self-indul-
gent improvisation and tight pre-
rehearsed melodic and rhythmic
punches, and pretty much always
come out with the goods.
There may be a chance that you
haven’t heard of Do Make Say
Think before, but their music is
available in different means and is
worth checking out. But this week,
I have been thinking about in-
strumental music and its nature.
I know a lot of people when they
first hear an instrumental band
are stricken by the lack of vocals
and can’t get past it. It just shows
that with a lot of modern music,
an emphasis is put on the vocals,
lyrics and ‘front-man’. All I know is
that if I listen to a band with vocals
and the backing music is uninven-
tive and uninspired and precisely
that, backing music, I am turned
off.
It appears we have never moved
on from the 50s and 60s band
formation such as Jerry and the
Pacemakers. I don’t want to hear
the instruments buried in a mess
that necessitates the lead singer,
I want to hear bands working
as a whole. This tenuously de-
scribes the difference between Do
Make Say Think and The Shins:
Do Make Say Think make music
through a communal effort and
there are many brilliant layers,
whereas The Shins struggle to
move beyond simple structures,
ideas and layers. The Shins first
album showed both their scope
and their pinnacle.
section becoming more prominent
with hints towards the work of Six
Organs of Admittance who was
gaining stature at the time. Do
Make Say Think albums seem to be
both introverted in that they reflect
the progress of the relationships
in the band, but they are reflective
and seem to absorb the musical en-
vironment around them.
With their new album, they ap-
pear to have taken on board many
of the ideas and feel of the recent
resurgence in folk-inspired music,
both psychedelic and lo-fi. Akron/
Family make a high-powered (and
occasionally loud) folk racket and
they seem to be an inspiration and
key collaborator (I imagine they
sing the vocals) on this album. So,
acousticguitarsandloose,andquick
waltz-time drumming is the order
of the day and oh, how delightfully
they do it. The range in dynamics
also invigorates the music where
A With Living has hushed acoustic
guitars and group singing and The
Universe! has foot-on-the-monitor
riffs up to the eyebrows. This album
is both raucous and delicate like a
load of folk musicians piled up into
the back of your local pub and pis-
sed out of their minds whilst two
blokes in the back hit as much stuff
as they can.
When they were recording this al-
bum they were recording a commu-
nity giving each other a big musical
hug and sloppy kiss. Fun, yes fuck-
ing fun! Something you will never
hear uttered in the same passing
phrase as post-rock is the word fun,
and I’m not saying, “Blink 182 are
fun,” I am saying this is uplifting
and feel-good in a non-guilty way.
For those who would call me
pretentious for liking this, I can’t
emphasise just how much fun this
album is. It is not miserable fluff
like so much rubbish around at the
minute, it is a load of friends dig-
ging deep, strapping their guitars
on and making essential music.
So for those who did not know, fun
is two drummers and a huge horn
section.

album review
The Shins
Wincing The Night Away
(Transgressive Records)
★★✩✩✩
The Shins are an odd lot, in these
times of every group having a hook,
or as Mark Thompson would say, an
'ident', it is unusal to come across
such an oustandinly bland band.
Wincing The Night Away is The
Shins third release distributed by
the hip Transgressive Records la-
bel, in a roster including Lady Fuzz
and the equally dull Young Knives.
All the same listening to the album
is not offensive either and is best
described as a dull sunday morning
– where the Velvet Underground
would be classed as the good
version.
Tracks like Red Rabbit drag on,
the cheery vocal sound of James
Mercer is marred by a droll set of
lyrics and a group behind him who
sound like a band of hippies who
have only just been able to afford all
the milky delay pedals they had wet
dreams about. The result? The al-
bum has no punch or feel, the bass-
ist should have just not bothered,
the drummer makes a drum ma-
chine have groove and the guitarist,
well we have already covered them.
The album seems 20 years too late,
the jangly prog approach apparent-
ly wooed critics when the Shins de-
buted but why have some modern
attempt when you can pick up the
real deal? In truth some people will
like this album, those mellow, pubic
hair combing, merkin knitters will
probably drive Prius hybrid cars,
smell there own farts and talk with
their eyes closed they are so smug.
