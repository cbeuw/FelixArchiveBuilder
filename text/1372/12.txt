I realised, not very long ago, that
you don’t really go to see Swan Lake
for the story – it is, after all a fairly
simple fairytale: ‘Once upon a time,
there was a Prince, he was sad and
unfulfilled, he meets a mysterious
Princess who is also sad and unful-
filled, he vows eternal love, he ac-
cidentally breaks this vow, Prince
and Princess commit suicide and
live happily ever after in the after-
life’. It reads like a somewhat ma-
cabre horoscope. No, you go to see
Swan Lake for the dancing and the
music, and you won’t be disappoint-
ed at all by what’s on offer from the
Royal Ballet in its current run of
performances.
On opening night, Roberta Mar-
quez and Ivan Putrov danced the
roles of Odette/Odile and Prince
Siegfried beautifully. Ivan Putrov is
a very young Prince, not so much
melancholy as a rich boy who has
not yet found much in life, but won-
derfully attentive and enamoured of
Odette, endearingly earnest in his
declarations of love and enough of
an innocent to convince us that he
could be deceived so completely by
the machinations of Von Rothbart
and his daughter.
It is often said that the dual role
of Odette/Odile is one of the most
challenging in the classical rep-
ertoire for a ballerina; she has to
embody all the qualities of the swan
princess and those of the enchant-
er’s daughter, captivating both the
prince and the audience. In this,
Marquez succeeds more in her in-
terpretation of Odile – here she is
out to dazzle the Prince, playing
with him, delighting in her mastery
of the situation but knowing all the
time that he never stood a chance.
Her pas de deux with the Prince is
calculated, she really looks like she
is enjoying the whole deception,
trembling a little and flicking her
arms in a cool imitation of Odette’s
wings, giving him just enough rope

to hang himself on. As Odette, Mar-
quez is lovely and sorrowful but
not quite majestic enough to be a
queen and needed a more melting
quality in her movements to really
convince us of her plight.
There were excellent supporting
performances all round. Belinda
Hatley, Laura Morera and Yohei
Sasaki performed a lively and up-
lifting Act I pas de trios, Alastair
Marriott was a suitably menacing
Evil Spirit and later, a stylish, Mo-
hawk-adorned Von Rothbart and
Iohna Loots and Michael Stojko
provided a perky Act III Neapolitan
dance. The corps was well drilled
and particularly mesmerising in
the white acts and the Orchestra of
the Royal Opera House played with
passion and subtlety under Pavel
Sorokin. If only the production itself
was as even.
This production mounted by
Anthony Dowell is set firmly in
Russia, rather than the Germany
that is suggested by the charac-
ters’ names, which is fine as it fits
Tchaikovsky’s music better. But in
some Acts, notably the non-lake-
side ones, the scenery is overpow-
eringly fussy. Acts II and IV are
reasonably restrained and the final
tableaux, although very traditional,
is genuinely beautiful; but in Act
I, I can never understand why the
Prince decides to hold his birthday
celebrations in a gloomy forest, with
bits of tinsel and baubles hanging
from the branches and apparently
on the edges of a mist-enveloped
swamp.
When the curtains open on Act III,
you would be forgiven for thinking
that they had made a horrible mis-
take and taken us to Von Rothbart’s
castle instead of Prince Siegfried’s,
as it is so full of dangling wires, red
lighting, oppressive bits of metal
and an enormous staircase that
would not look out of place in a par-
ticularly high-camp production of
Phantom of the Opera. If anything,
it distracts the eye and makes the
dancing harder to see, not some-
thing that is particularly desirous
in a ballet production.
The Royal Ballet is in the fortu-
nate position where it has wonder-
ful dancers at all levels of its ranks;
it just needs a production that can
fully do them justice. It may not be
the cheapest company to see but
you can get tickets from £11 sitting
and £5 standing from the box office
on the day, and its an effort that
would be well worth it. As someone
once told me, ‘our Olympians of
dance’ are on top form, in a sold-
out, if imperfect, production of this
most famous of ballets.

From time to time large galleries
like the National, Portrait and Tate
Britain advertise re-hangs or ex-
hibitions aimed at bringing in the
crowds and heightening the profile
of the gallery.
Manet to Picasso is one such ex-
hibition, and with almost nothing
of interest to anyone with a basic
knowledge of the primary colours,
it is more or less just a tourist trap.
Don’t be deceived by the impres-
sive list of works on display here.
Yes, you can see Van Gogh’s Sun-
flowers, Renoir’s Boating on the
Seine and Monet’s The Water-Lily
Pond just a few feet away from each
other, but you won’t experience an-
ything from them in the dark and
cramped Sainsbury Wing. In fact
you probably won’t even see any-
thing new, as these are some of the
most famous paintings in the world.
This exhibition has simply no depth
or direction, and you’re more likely
to come out (like me) thinking that
you’ve just wasted a good half-hour
elbowing your way through hoards
of tourists with their screaming
children.
It does have a saving grace.
Seuret’s Bathers at Asnières, a fa-
vourite painting of mine, is placed
with a collection of Seuret’s stud-
ies. This nod to the artistic process
is sadly unique in this exhibition. If
you do insist on going, I find that
most galleries tend to be devoid of
all but the most die-hard art stu-
dents on Tuesday mornings, pos-
sibly the only time you could really
enjoy these pieces.
You’re much better off heading
upstairs to look at the highly under-
rated religious paintings of the 13th
and 14th centuries. It doesn’t seem
fashionable to show off these excel-
lent medieval works in our largest
galleries, but for me they’re some
of the most moving and inspiring
art you can see in London.
Don’t let these galleries tell you
what to like. A lack of knowledge of
art is not a reason to lack an opin-
ion. Sure the Impressionists revo-
lutionised painting, but that doesn’t
mean that you have to appreciate
them, and there are plenty of inter-
esting artistic movements that are
frequently overlooked for this kind
of show.
London has such a wealth of free
art at your disposal, these no-brain
exhibitions are almost an insult to
our rich heritage.
