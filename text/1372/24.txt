Every winter, Imperial College Glid-
ing Club (icGC) has a tour to a ridge
site in the UK, so that our members
can experience the soaring we don’t
get at our home club, Lasham. The
time of year does, however, mean
the length of flying that occurs can
be very varied.
Learning our lessons from last
year, we decided to venture north
to Portmoak again over New Year,
but this time for 7 days, in the hope
that we could do better than the 2
out of 4 days flying we got. Despite
the trailer for our own two-seater
Imperial Gliding Club winter tour
On a wing, a prayer and a diet of haggis and deep-fried Mars bars, icGC enjoys ridge soaring and waves
breaking a few weeks beforehand,
our CFI kindly agreed to part with
their DG1000 for a week. So 12 of us,
including four instructors, arrived
complete with our two single-seat-
ers (a Discus and an ASW-24) and
the DG1000. Now all we needed was
the weather to be on our side.
Well, to be fair, we can’t complain.
We got 6 days, and the only thing
that stopped us on the other day
was that great excuse “it was too
windy to rig”. I’d have settled with
that, however the weather was bet-
ter than that – there was wave to be
had. We had one classic wave day,
which resulted in a Silver Height,
a Gold Height, and our resident
“mountain goat” getting to 14500’.
Even the DG went to 10000’ numer-
ous times (and a record 11.7knt
average climb). Our captain, how-
ever, was only able to manage 2800’,
though he was shown the error of
his ways later in the day.
Every day the ridge was working
like a train. As a result, even the
most inexperienced in our party
got to experience ridge soaring
(and the occasional running silli-
ness), as well as continuing their
training. Ridge soaring for the first
time is like nothing else, weaving
in and out, following the contours
of the hill, often less than a wing-
span away from the side of the hill.
Those who could fly the single-seat-
ers were able to hone their soaring
skills on the ridge, or escape off and
try to explore the wave; most days
there was something to be found.
By staying on-site, not only did
we have direct access to Irene
and Steve’s wonderful food, it also
meant we could fall out of bed and
start rigging before it was even
properly light (though this was too
early for some). It’s a nice feeling
sitting down to breakfast knowing
that you’re ready for a good day’s
soaring.
The other advantage of winter
tours at Portmoak is its proxim-
ity to various towns. This came as
a relief last year, but I can’t say it
was needed it this time. We did nev-
ertheless have evening outings in
both Perth and Edinburgh.
The only downside to the tour
were our Hogmanay celebrations.
Originally we planned to go to the
Street Party in the capital, but by
the time we had been diverted
round to Kincardine (the Forth
Bridge was shut due to high winds)
all the celebrations were cancelled,
not to mention numerous trees
down, wheelie-bins and even a
trampoline on the roads as a result
of the 90mph winds.
So New Year’s was spent sat
round a TV in one of the member’s
houses. In a way it was a relief, as
everyone was so tired from the pre-
vious days’ flying that an early night
was just what we needed. We did re-
turn to Edinburgh later in the week
though, for the traditional Scottish
meal of haggis, neaps and tatties,
followed by a deep-fried Mars bar
(and a pub crawl).
The other evenings we stayed at
the gliding club, where you’re guar-
anteed a friendly atmosphere, with
everyone sharing experiences of
the day’s flying and the occasional
strange conversation. It’s one of
the few places I’ve flown where the
locals make you feel so welcome
(must be the Scottish hospitality).
So many years in the past we
come back without actually flying
at all. Thus the fact that everyone
managed at least 3 hours flying is
all the more impressive. Having
had an exceptionally successful
winter tour, what does hit you is just
how far away the summer soaring
season is. Oh well, there’s always
uni in the meantime.
