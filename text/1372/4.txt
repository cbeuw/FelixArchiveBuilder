Gay adoption – where’s the crime?
C
hristians, Jews and
Muslims put down their
Katusha rockets, gre-
nades and holy texts
at the end of 2006 for
an afternoon of protest against the
Labour government’s Equality Act,
due to come into force in April. But
it was no peace deal that brought
about such an act of unity. Instead a
common hatred, greater than that
which compels these religions to
murder one another and, for those
lacking the sufficient funds, blow
themselves up, meant they were on
the same side of the protest fence.
The gays. Long condemned by
the great Lord in the sky through
His various messengers and their
post humus biographers, and sure-
ly scurvy to all that humanity holds
true and dear. It is quite likely that
should these unhumans, who now
have the right to form legal part-
nerships, have free reign to adopt
any child they please, God (peace
be upon Him and all the rest of it)
shall conjure up a lightning bolt the
size of the Crab Nebula and fire it
upon the Earth, killing all those
guilty of sin, and leaving their en-
lightened bretherin in but a slightly
disfigured state.
Perhaps the greatest shame of
all from this episode in sectarian
squabbling, is that the Equality Act
addresses everybody who could
possibly be discriminated against,
especially those so angered by it.
In reference to the current dispute,
Christian supported adoption agen-
cies cannot refuse a Muslim couple
on the grounds of religion.
The Church believes that gay
couples are unfit to raise children.
“The key thing we have to remem-
ber in all of this is the interests of
the children” Cardinal Cormac
Murphy-O’Connor said in his letter
to cabinet ministers. Are all gays
With the Equality Act due to come into force in April, religious leaders have united to condemn one of the
consequences of the act – the right of homosexual couples to adopt from public adoption services
really any less qualified than any
man and woman? How can it be
claimed that well educated, stable
single sex couples are always fun-
damentally worse than a Mr and
Mrs who drink Stella Artois and left
school with one GCSE in Geogra-
phy between them? Are there no
homosexuals with steady incomes
and reasonable judgment?
I don’t imagine that all same sex
couples will want to adopt; prob-
ably not even a majority. But those
who do, deserve the same access
and options. Cases should be on an
individual basis, and genuinely for
the good of the little scamper. The
church should not have a legal ex-
emption to discriminate.
That neither Christian nor Islamic
scriptures were written at the time
of their respective prophet’s lives
(in fact several hundred years af-
ter) and that interpretations of the
word of God changes whenever is
convenient for those in power must
surely be seen in this ‘enlightened’
era, with increasingly easy access
to information, for what it is. Was
it not enough for Karl Marx to pro-
claim that religion was the ‘opium
of the masses’?
Christ fought the Romans and be-
came the reasoning to crusade, the
Jews united against the Egyptians,
Canaanites and Philistines, and Is-
lam was the tool of the caliphs to
spread their power and influence
across the whole of north Africa
and into Spain.
Organised religion, specifically
the monotheistic entities spawned
in the unforgiving desserts of the
Middle East, has been but the rules
of leaders; Moses, Mohammad
(peace be upon Him and all the rest
“Are all gays
really any less
qualified than
any man and
woman?”
of it), Jesus; searching for clout and
legitimacy. What better legitimacy
then to come from our creator and
destroyer. What greater impetus to
martyr yourself than the promise
of an afterlife of eternal bliss. What
greater incentive to behave than
the threat of divine wrath. For what
Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Conner, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams
it’s worth, this author believes that
religion is and has been a good tool
for human accomplishment.
But it becomes obsolete and un-
fortunate when those who wield
power start to believe the very
fairy tales designed to control the
masses.
Climate change, and what you can do to help
C
limate change is one
of the most important
issues in the modern
world. We all know that
the climate is changing
and that this is a result of our activi-
ties. Science has established that cli-
mate change is a real phenomenon
and the major cause, an increase in
carbon dioxide, are directly related.
There is no debate on the validity
of these facts in the scientific com-
munity. The reality is that most of
us will see the dramatic effects of
climate change in our lifetime.
The problem is that we know all
these facts, but what can one per-
son do to help? Surely these are
issues that can only be tackled on
a global level? Well, yes and no. In
reality, governments have to change
the big things and we, the individu-
als, need to change the little things.
Like the old proverb says, ‘you climb
a mountain in little steps, not one
leap’. If we are to reduce the effects
of climate change we need to re-
duce the amount of carbon dioxide
we put into the atmosphere. This is
not a difficult concept; even George
Bush has conceded this basic rela-
tionship. The major contributor to
human produced carbon dioxide is
power generation, and a crucial step
in reducing the amount of carbon
dioxide entering the atmosphere is
to reduce the amount of energy we
use.
So what can we do? Well, there are
numerous ways we can all help save
energy in our halls of residence,
home or on campus. The obvious
example is to turn off lights when
they are not required, such as when
we leave a room. Also, leaving your
PC, TV, or CD player on when you
are not using it wastes a lot of en-
ergy, and even on standby the power
usage can range between 10 and 15
watts or more. If you leave four de-
vices on standby, it uses the equiva-
lent power of a 60 watt bulb. Over
the past year in the UK the Energy
Saving Trust estimates that stereos
left on standby have cost £290m in
electricity and produced 1.6 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide.
We can also influence the policies
of the shops we use and the places
we work. Imperial is at the very fore-
front of environmental science, but if
we look closer even here there are a
few minor changes that could make
a world of difference, possibly liter-
ally. In the communal areas of some
halls of residence the lights are left
on 24 hours a day. If this is the case
in your hall, discuss this with the
wardening team and the hall man-
agers, possibly no one has thought
of changing the lighting? If the
lights can not be turned off because

they are needed for safety reasons
suggest that timers, or movement
sensors are used, and if the light is
absolutely necessary make sure en-
ergy saving bulbs are used. In fact
make sure your hall, home or area
of campus is using energy saving
bulbs full stop. In many areas of col-
lege these methods are already be-
ing used, but there is definitely room
for improvement and a bit of positive
encouragement never hurts.
Another effective step to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions is to recy-
cle things. Many items can be recy-
cled for less energy that it takes to
make a new item. So, use recycle
bins where they are available. If
your department does not have re-
cycle bins then ask for them to be
introduced. Little steps like these
will help us save energy, save people
money, and ultimately reduce the
impact of climate change.
