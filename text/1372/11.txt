The albums, they are now aflowing
Jamie T
Panic Prevention
(EMI)
★★★★✩
album review
At the tender ages of 20 Jamie T
should be pretty impressed with the
amazing amount of hype and spec-
ulation that has been surrounding
his debut album Panic Prevention.
I first heard his debut single Sheila
over the summer when it amassed
a simply staggering amount of
airplay on the likes of XFM and
Radio 1 since which the Jamie T
bandwagon has been growing at an
alarming rate with his latest sin-
gles If you ain't got the money and
Calm Down Dearest only served to
further fuel the hype.
Snoop Dogg
Tha Blue Carpet Treatment
(Geffen Records)
★★✩✩✩
Who can bring together Nate Dogg,
The Game, Dr Dre, Ice Cube,
George Clinton, Akon, Stevie Won-
der, Damian Marley and R. Kelly on
a single album and still call it his
own? Its the Snoop dee-ooh-double-
gee of course!
It was over 10 years ago when Dre
produced Snoop's debut, Doggy-
style – a record that has since gone
quadruple platinum shifting over 6
million units in the US of A alone.
Since then the Dogg has had mod-
erate sales, ever popularised by the
white middle class of America who
are responsible for the rise of NWA
and gangsta rap in general. Tour-
ing on Lollopalooza and working
alongside popstars such as Justin
Timberlake and Pharrel, Snoop
has certainly being playing the
PR game in the last few years al-
though R&G still struggle to mimic
anything like the success of his first
1993 release.
Opening with Intrology you soon
realise Snoop is back on top of the
game, oozing attitude before cas-
cading into Think About It, one of
the few tracks on the album when
Snoop flies solo. The album demon-
The 1st of December, Christmas
on the way, term nearly over. Not a
bad day all in all but just to add to
it, Felix sent me to meet The View.
Sounds almost mystical in a way
but sadly it’s not really, The View
are a band from Dundee in Scot-
land, they play what you would nor-
mally call ‘indie’ music and they are
going to be huge!
After a wild goose chase to Cam-
den, we meet up with Keiren (bass
player and songwriter) in a Holiday
Inn at King’s Cross. He starts by
asking where we’re from and after
being told, politely declines being
sent a copy of Felix.
So you’re playing Brixton Acade-
my tonight then? Looking forward
to it?
Yeah, its Brixton academy [sic]
man! Great venue.
There a couple of weeks ago
weren’t you? With The Fratellis?
Mmm, was good. We played in
Cardiff supporting peaches [sic],
then jumped in the van, drove from
Cardiff to Brixton. Supposed to be
onstage at 11 and we showed up at
five too [sic], but when we went on
stage it was great. There here [sic]
loads of people there to see us an
[sic] stuff.
Well, we enjoyed it. Are you play-
ing the Winter Wonderland shows
for Xfm?
Yeah up in Glasgow, it’s [sic] that
not on Thursday?
I have no idea man, your playing
it, not me!
Yeah yeah, it’s on Thursday.
So you’re doing two nights at Brix-
ton, then where are you off to?
Astoria! Our headline show! Big-
gest headline show we’ve done to
date, Sold out!
Well you’ve created quite a bit
of hype, when did you sign with
1965?
February or something, but we
knew we were going to sign (with
them) before that. I think probably
from fireworks night [sic] last year
we knew we were going to sign with
James (Endeacott, one of 1965s two
owners, discoverer of the libertines,
strokes [sic], etc) but we never actu-
ally signed until just after we came
off the Babyshambles tour.
We were a bit overwhelmed by
the fan-base you’ve managed to
accumulate when we last saw you
at Brixton.
Yeah it was fuckin [sic] cool, we
didn’t know what to expect having
never been to Brixton before. All
the carling academy’s [sic] are sort
of the same but that ones [sic] a
bit different really. I mean just the
chants, when we arrived it was all
run run run, an [sic] grabbing gui-
tars. But you could hear [the crowd]
chant, an it was great to jump on-
stage. I can’t wait to play it again to-
night, a [sic] tomorrow will be bet-
ter cause [sic] it’s the last night of
the tour. It’ll be messy tomorrow.
When you signed with James (En-
deacott) there were a couple of
other labels after you I think, why
choose them?
Aye, aye there was. Met a guy
from EMI, he was a tosser, and vir-
gin [sic] too. James was the first
out of any label to get in touch with
us. Our manager had said that wed
[sic] better start thinking about who
we wanted to sign with cause [sic]
we have different offers, an [sic] I
was thinking im [sic] just gonna
[sic] sign with the 1st company that
comes along an [sic] gives you some
money! But he pushed us to say so
I said rough trade, id [sic] like to be
with rough trade [sic] which is who
James was with at the time. An
[sic] then he left rough trade [sic]
to start up 1965 so.
He flew up to come to a gig in
Dundee, loved in [sic] an [sic] par-
tied all night long then went back
down to London the next day. We
had a gig in Glasgow the next night,
and he fuckin [sic] flew back up
again met with us there and was
like ‘surprise!’ an [sic] like pogo-
ing at the front of the gig. The guy
from virgin [sic] was like ‘I signed
the kooks’ [sic] that was the end of
that!
About a year ago I think you had
a small EP out with a local label in
Dundee?
Yeah our manager runs a really
small label, I think that ep [sic] is
all they’ve ever released. Came out
in January.
That was just when you were play-
ing The Doghouse (small venue in
the middle of Dundee) wasn’t it?
Yeah just The Doghouse and a cou-
ple of local pubs and stuff.
There a few crazy stories about
why you were thrown out of the
first pub you wrote and practiced
in, the Bay View I think?
It just got a bit outta [sic] hand, Kyle
(lead signer) his cousin owned it an
[sic] was just as much of a nutter as
me an [sic] Kyle about the band. An
[sic] we used to just sit up and drink
the place dry. I mean there’s a story
about us driving a scooter along the
bar, but its [sic] wasn’t a fuckin [sic]
Harley Davidson, it was just one of
them push scooters we went along
on and jumped onto the dance floor!
It was mainly cause [sic] we kept
stealing drink that we got chucked
out.
You were originally a cover band I
think weren’t you?
Yeah we were, but we stopped do-
ing that when we were seventeen.
We used to play caravan parks for
money, it was quite cool.
What kind of stuff did you play?
About sixty percent of the set was
oasis [sic] songs an [sic] the rest
was kina [sic] split between t-rex
[sic] and the Beatles
You were in town last night. Get
up to anything much?
We were playing with Babysham-
bles last night (at one of the anti
racism gigs) it was really funny.
There’s was [sic] no sound check
or anything, typical shambles [sic]
gig.
How long you been touring with
Primal Scream now?
Bout [sic] 3 weeks ago, 17 dates.
You’ve got the album coming out
in the new year sometime? All
recorded?
25th of January its [sic] coming
out I think, its [sic] all recorded an
[sic] mixed were just trying to get
the artwork an [sic] stuff right. I’m
fuckin [sic] ecstatic with it man
Going straight onto the album
tour when that’s out? Or are you
having a break?
We'll not get a break, I was under
the impression we were getting one
over Christmas but we only have
the 22nd and the 25th off! An [sic]
then on the 1st of January were go-
ing to America an to Japan in a few
weeks.
Have you done any overseas gigs
before?
We did a festival in Italy over the
summer and we did Ibiza rocks.
That was fuckin [sic] great man. Its
[sic] like a big pub but it don’t [sic]
have any roof on it or anything! An
[sic] the backstage areas is up a
level an [sic] right on Santonio bay.
You can watch the sunset while
having a drink! Their trying to cash
in on the indie bands over there, but
thieve [sic] still got a dance attitude
to it, the [sic] don’t get the whole
thing. Their [sic] putting loads of
dancers in bikinis on stage with us,
they've no idea what to do!
What was it like working with
Definitely Maybe producer, Owen
Morris?
Ah, its fuckin [sic] great man.
Owens [sic] like my mate now. He’s
just mental to work with. Defiantly
[sic] the craziest person I know.
Just after we finished recording we
went for a drive in a field in his jag
to see what it sounded like. An he’s
like ‘you drive, you drive, chase that
rabbit’ an [sic] as we where [sic]
chasing it the bumpers fell off, then
driving home it broke down, some-
thing had happened to the engine
an [sic] it was a write off. His wife
came out on the last day an [sic]
went mental cause he’d obviously
blamed it all on me.
At this point Keiren leaves to attend
the night’s sound-check, a novel
experience for him at the Brixton
Academy. So, having no more band
members to interview, we depart.
The View played that evening to a
crowd who already knew them de-
spite the lack of released material
and the fact that everyone there
should have been there to see Pri-
mal Scream.
They play songs that make you
want to dance and sing along, while
that’s not particularly unusual for
me, it seemed that many people felt
the same way. Minor technical diffi-
culties were experienced for a good
20 minutes however, but unfazed by
roadies running left, right and cen-
tre they pulled through to finish the
set.
All I’m going to say to you now is
this: the album Hats Off The Busk-
ers comes out on the 22nd of Janu-
ary, if you do not own it by the 23rd
you will already have missed out on
something.

A view to an inter-view: The View interview
Armed with his acoustic bass gui-
tar and some of the freshest, sharp-
est, most observant lyrics around at
the moment Jamie T has managed
to combine elements from a wide
range of genres. Fusing funk, hip-
hop, punk and reggae he manages
to create a fairly unique sound, at
least in the more commercial mu-
sic scene, that will only help to ce-
ment this young man into the Brit-
ish music scene.
Lyrically speaking Jamie T takes
his inspiration from his surround-
ings of grimy London bringing in
aspects of teenage life in London
to most of his songs such as Sheila
and XXX. Discussion of teenage
life is something Jamie T certainly
doesn't shy away speaking openly
about girls finding love behind
the bike-shed and drunken bar
fights doesn't seem to phase this
youngster.
Speaking volumes about teenage
life in Britain Panic Prevention will
no doubt strike a chord with it's in-
tended audience across the country
almost certainly making it a huge
seller.
Tom Whitson
album review
strates the high production values
of R&G along with the classic rap
album structure. That's That Shit
feat. R. Kelly covers smooth 'titty
style' content while Gangbangn 101
is clearly the uzi spraying niggaz
track of the album.
Past this, there is not much to say
about this album, it is generic but
fresh, it doesn't step on the toes of
anything before but then again it
doesn't push the boundaries of the
genre either – Tha Blue Carpet
Treatment offers good entertain-
ment, but don't expect the world.

Jamie T looking down at you, you worthless worm
