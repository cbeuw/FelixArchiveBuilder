signers currently make their sam-
ple sizes size 6. The sample size is
what models wear on the catwalk,
and so models are pressurised into
being a certain size. Making a wide
range of sizes, while being politi-
cally correct, is expensive.
So why shouldn't designers make
the sample size larger, do they pre-
fer working with slim models? The
truth is, it's just easier to design
clothes around girls who are 2-D
dimensional. It's easier to transfer
designs from paper to model with-
out those annoying curves getting
in the way.
Rates of obesity in England have
been increasing steadily for a while,
and soon we could be giving Ameri-
cans a run for their money. Well,
figuratively. The reason England
has one of the highest obesity rates
in Europe is that it doesn't have a
culture of food comparable to coun-
tries like Italy and France. In part
this is the fault of feminists.

Anorexia: a media problem?
Is the eating disorder a major concern or just an excuse for sensationalist journalism?

does the media have any responsi-
bly towards these vulnerable teen-
age girls?
The model Giselle said of anorex-
ia, "I never suffered this problem
because I had a very strong family
base. The parents are responsible,
not fashion." Anorexia isn't just a
disease, it's a symptom of wider
mental health problems. Obviously
it's not responsible to publish pho-
to's of blatantly anorexic models.
However if a girl is a natural size
4 (equivalent to American size
zero), should she be stopped from
modelling?
Why are painfully thin girls used
in fashion advertising in the first
place? Is it a case of aspiration sell-
ing? You can never be too rich or too
thin. Designers focused solely on
the bottom line should think about
working with bigger sample sizes.
Surveys have shown that women
are more likely to buy products ad-
vertised by a model who is size 12
rather than smaller sizes. All de-
Anorexia and obesity are the
health problems currently garner-
ing the most attention. Ironically
perhaps, yet although anorexia and
obesity cause opposite shocking
extremes in appearance, are they
both manifestations of a sick cul-
ture? Are the sensationalist articles
justified in saying disordered eating
is on the rise and are unrealistic im-
ages in the media responsible?
The pacific island of Fiji had
been isolated from television until
the 90's, after it was introduced in
1995 there was a sharp increase in
symptoms of eating disorders. A
survey of teenage girls showed that
15%, an increase from 3% before
the arrival of television, reported
throwing up after meals.
The survey also showed 74% of
girls reported feeling "too big or
fat". So supposedly media does have
an effect on disordered eating. But

passed down families; the mother
teaches her daughters how to cook,
and they then cook for their hus-
band and teach their daughters.
With feminism came also micro-
wave meals and liberation from the
kitchen.
While this liberation can only be
a good thing, it has meant genera-
tions of families growing up without
knowing basic nutrition and how to
cook outside of microwave meals
and toast. The unhealthy modern
diet has meant an increase in obes-
ity or other disordered eating. If
you don't want to be fat, but don't
know how to eat healthily and don't
exercise, then the solution for some
people is not to eat.
Ifpeoplehadtheknowledgeofhow
to eat healthily and got of their ars-
es and exercised then we wouldn't
need a traffic light system. It's sad
that it's actually got to the stage
that the government needs to class
food as "red" "amber" or "green" be-
cause people don't know how to eat.
