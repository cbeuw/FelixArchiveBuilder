ICU "Job shop" plans thwarted
BY THE NEWS TEAM
Plans for a new 'job shop' for
Imperial students have been, put
on hold because of a lack of fund-
ing. Union staff had planned to
set up an employment agency as a
service for hard-up students, but
claim their plans have been
thwarted by an unsupportive
Finance department.
The scheme would have kept
a database of student skills and
availabilities which would then
be matched with part-time
vacancies in college as the need
arose. ICU had been hoping for
funds to support a full-time
member of staff for two years to
implement the programme, after
which the system would be reap-
praised.
Mike Hansen, IC Director of
finance, insisted that he had
given the scheme "a huge amount
of support" even though "we
haven't given them any money,
because that's not the way we do
it." Imperial College Union
receives its funding in a lump-
sum subvention, and College puts
no constraints on how it is allo-
cated. Mr Hansen said that if the
Union felt that establishing a job-
shop was an important student
service, then they "should sacri-
fice something else to fund it."
Defending the College's stance,
he exclaimed, "Just saying, 'Oi,
Guv, give us an extra £17,000'
just isn't the way we do it, regret-
tably." He also raised questions
over the welfare implications of
College actively encouraging
students to work whilst studying
full-time.
Matthew Crompton, ICU
Deputy President (Finance and
Services] insisted that the propo-
sition would have saved IC
money in the long run. Imperial's
sports' centre, catering, confer-
ences and residences divisions
have spent over £200,000 to date
on agency fees in order to fill job
vacancies. Although many of the

Professor Colin Poole of the
analytical chemistry department
has been inundated with calls
from the press over the past
week following the recent health
scare on so-called gender-bend-
ing drugs in babies' milk.
Professor Poole dismissed the
debate on whether thiolates in
milk could endanger the babies
fertility as being "a total non-
starter." He explained that the
amount of thiolate in the highest
contaminated samples he tested
were ten times below the
accepted level.
Professor Poole explained
that the contaminants were, very
common, and as they are present
in plastics, children are more
likely to get high doses of them
from sucking the bottle, than
from the milk itself.
But Professor Poole wel-
comed the more general discus-
sion on public health informa-
tion. "The tendency has been to
panic the public rather than
inform them," he said, citing the
recent "appallingly handled"
BSE crisis as an example.
Professor Poole spoke to six
newspaper reporters and two
television stations on Tuesday.
He was interviewed for
Canadian television last night.
"It was, for a very short time, a
big debate," he said, "Maybe
they didn't have much news that
day."
